[00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.707]  25 days, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:09.108]  25 days to the midterms.
[00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:10.950]  And we knew it was coming.
[00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.653]  I warned everyone over and over again that I was patient zero.
[00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:19.256]  The first domino to be totally deplatformed.
[00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:19.657]  And now...
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:38.955]  Working in concert, Twitter and Facebook banned 800 major conservative, Christian, libertarian, pro-life, pro-gun pages, some that had millions of followers apiece, from major, major publications.
[00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:48.183]  Everybody from Press From Truth to Michelle Malkin's page to you name it, 800 in one day banned.
[00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:49.484]  And you know what they said?
[00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:53.206]  They said, you are fake news.
[00:00:55.688 --> 00:01:02.634]  There's the Washington Post, Facebook purges over 800 US accounts and pages for pushing political spam.
[00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:05.977]  And then you read it's in the fake news category show.
[00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:09.540]  It's oh, now it's spam.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.362]  Oh, no, it's called being popular.
[00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:14.745]  And it's called the Washington Post.
[00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:21.952]  Who's all part of this cartel of mainstream media that goes around and judges what's fake news, what's spam, what's hate.
[00:01:23.232 --> 00:01:26.955]  And then now they're banned for being fake news and spam.
[00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:29.176]  They're banned because they're popular.
[00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:33.299]  And I'm going to explain when we come back how this works.
[00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:35.220]  But you have to understand, 15 years ago,
[00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:39.925]  90 plus percent of the internet was not social media networks.
[00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:45.607]  It was individual sites and a giant archipelago of millions and millions of popular sites.
[00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.188]  It was a vibrant internet and Matt Drudge warned.
[00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:52.809]  He said, you're all giving all your traffic to these places.
[00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:04.293]  You're pushing your audiences to Facebook and Twitter and these other globalist platforms, these gulags, these, these, the term he used was ghettos, digital ghettos.
[00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:21.001]  And in the last 15 years, it went from 90 plus percent being millions of individual sites that all got great traffic, and then billions of sites total, to four sites that get 90 plus percent of the traffic.
[00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:30.588]  And of course, radio shows, TV shows, everyone pushed their Facebook, everyone pushed their Twitter, everyone pushed their audience onto their and their content.
[00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.871]  And now the rug's being pulled out from under everybody.
[00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:44.491]  They're going, oh, we're our own companies, we're our own sites, but then they fight to shut down Gab.com and Infowars.com.
[00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:50.575]  And the Democrats have Federal Elections Commission meetings and say, we want Matt Drudge shut down.
[00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:55.218]  Oh, we want the payment processors as Alex Jones taken.
[00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:58.419]  Where's Congress?
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.821]  Eight hundred.
[00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:15.999]  And you added up, it's tens upon tens of millions of followers that went and subscribed, that gave their content on those conservative and nationalist and patriot sites, and they're all gone.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.281]  All gone.
[00:03:18.621 --> 00:03:25.726]  Not one strike, not two strikes, not three strikes, like they used to have, oh, so-called rules, they were still arbitrary and run by SJWs.
[00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:29.148]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they're just gone!
[00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.440]  Including real liberal sites.
[00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.961]  I would call Dan Dix a liberal.
[00:03:35.022 --> 00:03:35.863]  A liberal libertarian.
[00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:39.545]  Socially liberal, but a smart guy, filmmaker.
[00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:40.566]  He had 300,000 followers.
[00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:41.527]  Very popular filmmaker.
[00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:41.927]  Gone!
[00:03:42.687 --> 00:03:46.330]  Because they don't want real liberals around making other liberals look stupid.
[00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:48.591]  Who are fake liberals.
[00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:50.132]  So they're gone.
[00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:51.373]  And oh, don't worry.
[00:03:51.854 --> 00:03:56.777]  The Los Angeles Times and everyone else, they're all just celebrating.
[00:03:58.052 --> 00:03:59.553]  Now, people like Dan Dixon and others were smart.
[00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:00.553]  They had backup accounts.
[00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.193]  But see, oh, they'll get to those.
[00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:03.914]  They'll get to those.
[00:04:04.974 --> 00:04:07.255]  Now, that's big news and it's coming up.
[00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:08.776]  The amazing Kanye West event.
[00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:16.859]  The total racism of an all-white panel talking about how
[00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:24.504]  Kanye West is a dumb... and then other panels saying things I won't even really repeat or they'll edit it and say I said it.
[00:04:24.924 --> 00:04:33.248]  I mean, you talk about real KKK type caricatures and stereotypes, it is disgusting.
[00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:36.089]  But I'm very proud of Mr. Brown and Mr. West.
[00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.790]  And I'm very proud of Mr. Trump.
[00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.271]  And I'm very proud of all of you.
[00:04:41.952 --> 00:04:44.213]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:50.257]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:56.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:04.344 --> 00:06:12.989]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:26.011]  It gives me power in a way.
[00:06:26.311 --> 00:06:33.378]  You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home.
[00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:34.359]  And also, uh...
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.309]  I'm married to a family that, um, you know, not a lot of male energy going on.
[00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.350]  It's beautiful though.
[00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:47.718]  But there's times where, you know, it's something about, you know, I love Hillary.
[00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:49.020]  I love everyone, right?
[00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:51.143]  But the campaign, I'm with her.
[00:06:51.704 --> 00:06:59.148]  Just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son.
[00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:03.631]  There was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman.
[00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.932]  You made a Superman.
[00:07:05.252 --> 00:07:06.633]  That's my favorite superhero.
[00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:08.814]  And you made a Superman cape for me.
[00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:09.714]  Oh, I love you.
[00:07:09.874 --> 00:07:10.295]  I know.
[00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:13.236]  But I don't want to put you in that spot.
[00:07:13.296 --> 00:07:15.097]  No, I'm standing in that spot.
[00:07:15.158 --> 00:07:16.398]  I love this guy right here.
[00:07:16.438 --> 00:07:18.399]  Let me give this guy a hug right here.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.941]  I love this guy right here.
[00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:24.021]  That's really nice.
[00:07:24.842 --> 00:07:25.582]  And that's from the heart.
[00:07:25.622 --> 00:07:29.403]  I didn't want to put you in that position, but that's from the heart.
[00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:38.186]  It is Friday, the 12th day of October 2018.
[00:07:38.586 --> 00:07:40.107]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:42.127]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:43.648]  The war room's coming up.
[00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:49.960]  And I intend to open the phones up and take your phone calls throughout the entire transmission today.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:08:13.045]  To put it lightly, the confirmation that the globalists are as evil as we thought they were, in fact they're worse than we thought they were, and they're completely taking up the mask off, is a spiritual and cultural temper tantrum.
[00:08:13.957 --> 00:08:20.100]  It's like a demon being exercised out of the body.
[00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:32.846]  And when you look at the behavior of Soros and Hillary and all of these demonic entities, that's what they are, literally, you are witnessing their death throes, politically.
[00:08:34.207 --> 00:08:34.747]  And spiritually.
[00:08:37.428 --> 00:08:41.270]  And we've got clips dealing with Kanye today that are so insane
[00:08:43.376 --> 00:08:44.557]  I don't have words to describe it.
[00:08:45.137 --> 00:09:01.308]  The hit-and-run individual, who's allowed to hit and run in public while he's drunk driving, Chris Cuomo of CNN, with no viewers, he came out and said, we're gonna play the clip coming up, Trump looked like he was thinking racist thoughts.
[00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:06.272]  So they're projecting that out there now, on the weak-minded.
[00:09:07.632 --> 00:09:08.193]  Other hosts,
[00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:30.750]  said that Kanye West was a black ventriloquist dummy doll and that Trump basically was telling him what to say and that Kanye West is a black ventriloquist doll for white supremacy.
[00:09:33.063 --> 00:09:33.463]  That's right.
[00:09:34.244 --> 00:09:44.512]  A bunch of successful men who built their own incredible careers are there hugging on each other and meeting Mr. Brown, Mr. West, Mr. Trump.
[00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:54.481]  They're all there meeting, talking about how they want to bring America and the world together and how they want to invest in the
[00:09:57.233 --> 00:10:09.538]  Black community particularly, and to try to get fathers back in the homes, and try to have male energy infused back in, because what the globalists are doing is removing male energy so that they can lead and control everyone.
[00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:10.839]  They're breaking the human cycle.
[00:10:10.859 --> 00:10:13.360]  They're not trying to put feminine energy in charge.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.582]  They're trying to have corporate energy in control with divided slaves.
[00:10:17.862 --> 00:10:18.762]  That's in their WikiLeaks.
[00:10:19.062 --> 00:10:19.923]  It's in their own documents.
[00:10:19.983 --> 00:10:24.985]  And Kanye West is bringing a message of truth, a message of courage,
[00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:34.013]  And he pointed out that Trump is on a hero's quest and walking the walk of a hero.
[00:10:35.114 --> 00:10:36.135]  And that's what's happening here.
[00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.839]  And the evil does not know what to do.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.382]  And so what does Don Lemon and all the other hosts say?
[00:10:43.422 --> 00:10:51.350]  They say, poor Kanye, he is a, like a black minstrel actor.
[00:10:52.443 --> 00:11:21.941]  Minstrel shows where they would make fun of black people and and and and and others and that he is These are all quotes That that he is a uneducated dumb Negro that doesn't read I Mean, this is the most stereotypical racist horrible crap and then they edit what he says out of context So it doesn't make sense and they sit back and say look at the dumb black man Who's self-made and who has courage?
[00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:27.556]  Because the truth is, if anybody is a house slave, it's Don Lemon.
[00:11:31.697 --> 00:11:33.177]  He's a house slave of Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:33.817 --> 00:11:36.278]  And you can be black, you can be white, you can be brown.
[00:11:37.258 --> 00:11:38.178]  You can be yellow.
[00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:39.238]  You can be pink.
[00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:45.059]  You can be lying on a morgue slab and be purple, or blue.
[00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:48.300]  But if you serve the globalists, you are a slave.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.921]  Because see, slavery isn't about a skin color.
[00:11:53.703 --> 00:11:57.726]  It's about a position you're in, and a lot of slaves are slaves willingly.
[00:11:58.847 --> 00:12:02.710]  Like the soy boy, Don Lemon.
[00:12:04.131 --> 00:12:08.314]  The race pimp, Don Lemon, following the sick script.
[00:12:08.354 --> 00:12:10.736]  So, I'm gonna play all those clips when we come back.
[00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:14.859]  And I'm gonna play Mr. Brown's great speech from C-SPAN.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.403]  And I'm gonna get to a lot more coming up, and I'm gonna take your calls throughout the broadcast, but
[00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.852]  Here's the big news after the next segment.
[00:12:23.193 --> 00:12:24.013]  At the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:30.039]  This is the Washington Post.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.362]  Facebook purges over 800 U.S.
[00:12:33.422 --> 00:12:36.385]  accounts and pages for pushing political spam.
[00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:37.466]  And that's not counting Twitter.
[00:12:37.786 --> 00:12:41.469]  The big news here is... In fact, the numbers are coming out.
[00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:42.210]  It's worse than 800.
[00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:46.614]  They did it in exact concert in the same hour.
[00:12:51.324 --> 00:12:51.985]  As Twitter.
[00:12:52.965 --> 00:12:57.308]  And what did the good folks over at Buzzkill say?
[00:12:57.348 --> 00:12:57.789]  Buzzfeed?
[00:12:59.050 --> 00:12:59.770]  Fake News Kings?
[00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.471]  But they also do get the inside baseball.
[00:13:02.012 --> 00:13:03.453]  Oh, remember about six weeks ago?
[00:13:03.853 --> 00:13:09.717]  Oh, Facebook and Twitter and Google, they all met in secret to decide how to run the midterms.
[00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:11.458]  They even said how to respond to it.
[00:13:11.678 --> 00:13:19.444]  And you're seeing, and I predicted that right up to the election, they would end up banning every libertarian, Christian, conservative site
[00:13:20.396 --> 00:13:21.077]  Off these platforms.
[00:13:22.738 --> 00:13:23.519]  And they've now done it.
[00:13:24.359 --> 00:13:25.200]  And it's going to get worse.
[00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:45.438]  Oh, and now governments around the country, Democrat-run cities, they want to know if you're a Christian or a conservative, and they make you declare it on forms if you've ever been involved or a member of the NRA, and they're saying, we're not going to give you government contracts for cement or paper or food programs, for anything.
[00:13:46.678 --> 00:13:51.683]  If you are a conservative, if you are a gun supporter, you heard me.
[00:13:52.024 --> 00:13:52.584]  And why not?
[00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:53.946]  They're getting away with it.
[00:13:54.907 --> 00:13:56.088]  They got away with banning me.
[00:13:56.108 --> 00:13:58.571]  I told everybody, they're like, how are you taking it?
[00:13:58.911 --> 00:14:01.434]  Well, I'm taking it really bad because it means they're going to go after everybody.
[00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.290]  They're going to try to steal the election.
[00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.912]  And then they're going to go after what we say on the street and where we work and what religion we are.
[00:14:08.152 --> 00:14:09.353]  This is real authoritarianism.
[00:14:09.853 --> 00:14:10.933]  Oh, come on, Alex.
[00:14:10.993 --> 00:14:12.514]  You know, they say you're fake news.
[00:14:12.814 --> 00:14:13.794]  No, they're the fake news.
[00:14:14.074 --> 00:14:19.876]  They put out lies about me to set the precedent so Congress would sit there on their butts when this happened.
[00:14:21.037 --> 00:14:22.497]  And the Pentagon knows what's going on.
[00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:23.558]  Trump knows what's going on.
[00:14:23.778 --> 00:14:29.780]  He's surrounded by a bunch of addled yes-men who are all on the bankroll, the payroll,
[00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:32.507]  Of these big tech companies.
[00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:33.508]  They buy them cheap.
[00:14:33.868 --> 00:14:34.328]  Senators.
[00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:38.331]  You know, Google might give $50,000 to each senator laying on a year.
[00:14:38.571 --> 00:14:38.951]  Nothing!
[00:14:40.072 --> 00:14:41.393]  These are trillion dollar companies.
[00:14:42.594 --> 00:14:46.577]  They bought us up like a cheap whore.
[00:14:46.797 --> 00:14:47.237]  A $5 hooker.
[00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:50.580]  Now they're putting cigarettes out on us.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.341]  And now they're slicing us up.
[00:14:52.981 --> 00:14:57.144]  And we're so broke back, we're laying there in the bed while they beat us with a coat hanger.
[00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:00.787]  While they knock our damn teeth out!
[00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:03.649]  So don't go along with this anymore!
[00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.330]  You've got a birthright!
[00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.150]  I told you it's not about me!
[00:15:07.631 --> 00:15:09.171]  I told you they were coming for you!
[00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:10.231]  And they are!
[00:15:10.831 --> 00:15:15.573]  They're coming for talk radio, they're coming for your children, they want it all because they crave it!
[00:15:15.973 --> 00:15:20.054]  And if you roll over to this group of psychos, you deserve what you get!
[00:15:20.834 --> 00:15:23.775]  They're a gang of crooks that hadn't been put in their place!
[00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:31.958]  They're a bunch of knuckle-dragging trash, like Hillary and Soros, that have gotten away with all sorts of crimes, and they think they're invincible!
[00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.001]  Well, they're not invincible!
[00:15:34.502 --> 00:15:36.685]  And God is gonna smash them into the ground!
[00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:38.126]  And destroy them!
[00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:46.679]  Did you hear?
[00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:48.500]  Christmas is coming in October.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.982]  Black Friday's coming in October.
[00:15:51.062 --> 00:15:52.703]  Cyber Monday's coming in October.
[00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:56.206]  What's really coming in October is incredible deals.
[00:15:56.606 --> 00:15:59.508]  50% off at InfoWars4.com and free shipping.
[00:16:00.249 --> 00:16:07.374]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down InfoWars.com and to shut down your voice.
[00:16:08.094 --> 00:16:12.778]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want InfoWars to go the way of the Dodo Bird.
[00:16:13.968 --> 00:16:17.451]  For the way the dinosaurs, because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[00:16:18.572 --> 00:16:28.419]  Now you've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us, and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away, and to be able to take our banking away, so we can't even process orders.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.884]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[00:16:33.964 --> 00:16:39.048]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:54.036]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[00:16:54.616 --> 00:16:58.739]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:05.304]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming out on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[00:17:05.704 --> 00:17:07.666]  Black Friday's coming early.
[00:17:07.686 --> 00:17:08.887]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[00:17:09.007 --> 00:17:14.992]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[00:17:15.572 --> 00:17:20.937]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:29.405]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[00:17:30.186 --> 00:17:32.289]  Infowars is in your hands.
[00:17:33.504 --> 00:17:41.590]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Grudge Report put him to video and audio.
[00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.491]  Number one in the election of Trump.
[00:17:43.912 --> 00:17:48.575]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[00:17:49.116 --> 00:17:52.278]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[00:17:52.918 --> 00:17:57.862]  And so now they're coming after our ability, InfoWarsTore.com, to even have credit card processing.
[00:17:57.902 --> 00:18:01.144]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:03.346]  Get your X2.
[00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:06.369]  Even though it's selling out the last run, 50% off.
[00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.591]  Rainforest, selling out, 50% off.
[00:18:08.952 --> 00:18:10.413]  Super Melon Vitality, 50% off.
[00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:12.735]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:15.138]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[00:18:15.498 --> 00:18:18.941]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:23.466]  And, free shipping, store-wide, mformorestore.com.
[00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.228]  So, this is the October
[00:18:27.765 --> 00:18:29.186]  Black Friday coming early.
[00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:30.746]  This is Christmas coming early.
[00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:32.687]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.
[00:18:32.807 --> 00:18:34.867]  This is Christmas in October.
[00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:38.528]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great.
[00:18:38.608 --> 00:18:39.429]  The five-star ratings.
[00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:44.410]  And go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts so that you have them going to fight traffic.
[00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:49.032]  Christmas is only two months away and you can support the M4 War while getting great products a win-win.
[00:18:49.052 --> 00:18:50.112]  I'm counting on you.
[00:18:50.152 --> 00:18:51.092]  You've always come through.
[00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:55.974]  They know you always come through which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[00:18:56.654 --> 00:19:01.380]  With a five-star-rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.303]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[00:19:04.363 --> 00:19:05.104]  Nobody's got that.
[00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:06.685]  Credit card processing.
[00:19:07.106 --> 00:19:09.128]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[00:19:09.408 --> 00:19:10.009]  We expose them.
[00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:14.114]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.
[00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:21.217]  We're in some serious times because we've been effective, we've been strong, we've been forceful, we've been successful.
[00:19:21.237 --> 00:19:23.039]  You've been successful by supporting us.
[00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:30.923]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, today, in this mega sale, 50% off free shipping, to help bring the info war to the next level.
[00:19:31.164 --> 00:19:32.044]  I'm counting on you.
[00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:33.225]  You always come through.
[00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:34.306]  Take advantage of this.
[00:19:34.346 --> 00:19:36.487]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[00:19:44.691 --> 00:19:49.273]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:02.998 --> 00:20:09.540]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:18.141]  I want to say something here and I want to be infinity clear.
[00:20:19.762 --> 00:20:24.244]  This country and this world is in a battle between good and evil.
[00:20:25.145 --> 00:20:25.966]  You got to choose a side.
[00:20:26.686 --> 00:20:31.389]  And evil is going into overdrive because it senses and is witnessing a global awakening.
[00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:41.916]  And it is critical everybody be as active and focused as you can politically, spiritually, economically in the fight for freedom.
[00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.072]  Now is the time for peaceful, focused action.
[00:20:46.652 --> 00:20:50.274]  And if we do our part, God will deliver vengeance.
[00:20:52.055 --> 00:20:52.495]  Not us.
[00:20:53.656 --> 00:20:55.637]  We are not offensively going to do anything violent.
[00:20:56.178 --> 00:20:58.119]  But we are going to defend ourselves.
[00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:02.261]  And if they want a war, they're going to get one.
[00:21:04.362 --> 00:21:07.164]  But we are destroying them in the information war.
[00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:08.665]  We are annihilating them.
[00:21:09.305 --> 00:21:12.567]  And making them bring out open censorship up front.
[00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:19.800]  With 800 plus major sites banned at the same time off Twitter and Facebook in the same hour.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.561]  Total criminal coordination.
[00:21:23.922 --> 00:21:26.824]  And they didn't even say you broke rules or strikes.
[00:21:26.884 --> 00:21:31.067]  They said we consider your news to be conservative spam.
[00:21:32.236 --> 00:21:32.676]  Trash!
[00:21:32.836 --> 00:21:33.817]  Unwanted garbage!
[00:21:34.597 --> 00:21:35.637]  A total inversion!
[00:21:36.217 --> 00:21:40.319]  These are popular sites with millions of followers and hundreds of thousands of followers apiece.
[00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:44.220]  From respected conservative and libertarian and nationalist groups.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.020]  And they're all gone!
[00:21:48.961 --> 00:21:56.144]  And that's so these monsters at CNN and MSNBC can say that Kanye West is like a minstrel actor.
[00:21:57.604 --> 00:22:00.225]  A white person in blackface making fun of black people.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.401]  And that he is a dumb negro.
[00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:05.721]  This is what they're saying, not me.
[00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:08.062]  They'll probably edit and put this out.
[00:22:08.282 --> 00:22:13.664]  And that he's a puppet of Trump, a racist ventriloquist doll.
[00:22:14.024 --> 00:22:14.864]  I have all these clips.
[00:22:16.345 --> 00:22:17.205]  This is sick!
[00:22:20.286 --> 00:22:24.387]  This is Trump trying to have love, and Kanye trying to have love, and Mr. Brown trying to have love.
[00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:35.620]  And the establishment responds with the most sickening... There's articles on Infowars.com that are incredible.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.602]  Steve Watson has one that had so many examples this morning.
[00:22:38.622 --> 00:22:43.044]  Even though I didn't have time to spend 45 minutes on one article, I got up at 5 a.m.
[00:22:43.165 --> 00:22:43.405]  I did.
[00:22:44.375 --> 00:22:56.978]  I spent 45 minutes on this one article because there's dozens of tweets, seven or eight videos of the people saying the most horrible, nasty, racist crap I have ever heard in America.
[00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:06.641]  I mean, this is the stuff that you would hear out of the mouths of toothless KKK members.
[00:23:07.241 --> 00:23:08.221]  I mean, the worst.
[00:23:11.687 --> 00:23:37.656]  This is why they're so scared of this country coming back and us coming together and Mr. Brown and Mr. West and Mr. Trump seriously working out plans and delivering massive factories and jobs and startups to black inner-city areas and trying to develop plans to bring fathers back in the home and reverse the collapse of the black family which is the opening salvo of taking all our families down and it's admitted and they're doing it.
[00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:39.737]  Male energy.
[00:23:41.018 --> 00:23:56.665]  Jim Brown has spent, since he retired, whatever, 40 years ago, one of the greatest players ever, but he's really played on the field of life, spending his time, his money, actually trying to help youth, and trying to get fathers in people's lives.
[00:23:57.165 --> 00:24:03.288]  And there he is again doing it, and they call them all these horrible names, and stupid, and dumb.
[00:24:03.828 --> 00:24:06.190]  And oh, a woman once claimed he did something to her.
[00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:06.850]  Give me a break.
[00:24:10.239 --> 00:24:11.299]  It's unbelievable.
[00:24:12.579 --> 00:24:20.561]  For all the Democrats' money and all their propaganda and all their foreign funding, $38 million raised the last three months for Beto, who can hardly talk.
[00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:23.762]  He's another guy with a hit-and-run record, but that's okay.
[00:24:23.802 --> 00:24:24.382]  He's a Democrat.
[00:24:25.382 --> 00:24:26.542]  Raises $38 million.
[00:24:26.562 --> 00:24:29.603]  He wants to ban all assault rifles, all semi-autos in Texas.
[00:24:30.383 --> 00:24:31.863]  They're calling him the new Obama.
[00:24:32.363 --> 00:24:37.564]  They're hoping all this insane celebrity, oh, worshiping Beto, he'll remove Ted Cruz.
[00:24:38.225 --> 00:24:39.945]  Everyone in Texas, better vote.
[00:24:43.308 --> 00:24:50.332]  And I'm not saying do what the Democrats do, look at the obituary and find somebody that died and go in there and vote in their name.
[00:24:50.692 --> 00:24:52.373]  Plus, in Texas, we have ID.
[00:24:52.733 --> 00:24:53.794]  Oh, so that doesn't work that way.
[00:24:54.194 --> 00:24:54.734]  See how that works?
[00:24:58.296 --> 00:24:59.417]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:00.097 --> 00:25:01.638]  So let's start getting to some of these clips.
[00:25:02.699 --> 00:25:04.480]  Which one should we play first?
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:09.323]  Let's play the clip where they talk about
[00:25:10.347 --> 00:25:11.808]  I mean, I can't even hardly get to these clips.
[00:25:11.868 --> 00:25:12.849]  Maybe I shouldn't even play these.
[00:25:13.589 --> 00:25:21.975]  Let's play the one where they talk about, this is what happens when Negroes don't... Which, to the left, they've made that word Anglo-Negro.
[00:25:21.995 --> 00:25:24.176]  It just means like Negro in Spanish or Latin.
[00:25:24.196 --> 00:25:26.458]  It just means, you know, like you get the Mexican beer that's dark.
[00:25:26.478 --> 00:25:27.558]  It's, I want the Negro.
[00:25:27.758 --> 00:25:28.459]  I want the blonde.
[00:25:28.739 --> 00:25:29.319]  That's all that means.
[00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:33.042]  But the media has turned the word Negro into the N-word.
[00:25:33.996 --> 00:25:35.757]  And so they know what they're doing when they use it.
[00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:41.161]  I don't use it because a lot of ignorant people, especially ignorant white people, think it's the N-word.
[00:25:48.907 --> 00:25:49.667]  So let's go to that clip.
[00:25:49.687 --> 00:25:50.087]  Here it is.
[00:25:51.328 --> 00:25:53.330]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:25:54.611 --> 00:26:00.635]  And we have this now, and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it, and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures.
[00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:06.477]  Just looking at Scott's face.
[00:26:06.497 --> 00:26:11.658]  Listen, black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay?
[00:26:12.078 --> 00:26:15.299]  They've had it with him, and he's an attention whore like the president.
[00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:18.780]  He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.140]  He's the token negro of the Trump administration.
[00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:26.241]  This is ridiculous, and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously.
[00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:28.002]  He clearly has issues.
[00:26:28.322 --> 00:26:29.622]  He's already been hospitalized.
[00:26:29.942 --> 00:26:31.223]  He's already been hospitalized.
[00:26:33.732 --> 00:26:35.674]  This is white supremacy by ventriloquism.
[00:26:36.054 --> 00:26:41.119]  A black mouth is moving, but white racist ideals are flowing from Kanye West's mouth.
[00:26:41.639 --> 00:26:45.463]  Kanye West is engaging in one of the most nefarious practices yet.
[00:26:46.023 --> 00:26:58.614]  A black body and brain are the warehouse for the articulation and expression of anti-black sentiments that have been chin-checked by people with far more rigorous credentials.
[00:26:59.705 --> 00:27:00.906]  I mean, these are race-baiters.
[00:27:01.427 --> 00:27:03.348]  Who thinks that only white people can be racist?
[00:27:03.969 --> 00:27:04.770]  But it's beyond race.
[00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.534]  It's manipulation of people to keep us divided.
[00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:15.899]  And that's what these monsters... We have the memos from the last election where they said, go out and racially divide.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:26.429]  Top psychological warfare professors, psychiatrists, who are on the Hillary campaign at the highest levels, are telling her, this is what you've got to do.
[00:27:28.915 --> 00:27:30.596]  Expand the culture wars.
[00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:36.499]  That means women against men, men against women, black against white, and everything they're doing.
[00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:38.540]  By the way, I said I'd announce this last night, and I didn't.
[00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:41.562]  Remind me at the end of the hour to do it, guys.
[00:27:41.622 --> 00:27:46.324]  I need like a whiteboard in here or something, so I don't forget.
[00:27:46.344 --> 00:27:49.726]  I didn't tell you the rest of the story the other day.
[00:27:49.766 --> 00:27:56.370]  I got so excited when I was breaking down that it's confirmed Hillary will be given the nomination, like she was, you know, three years ago.
[00:27:59.369 --> 00:28:07.914]  So it's simply absolutely mind-blowing that all of this is happening and unfolding and it's going to get worse.
[00:28:07.954 --> 00:28:26.863]  Now coming up, we have Cuomo saying stuff even worse, that Trump was secretly thinking racist thoughts while he was looking at Jim Brown and looking at Kanye West and saying what a special, wonderful, courageous people they are for the courage they have.
[00:28:29.176 --> 00:28:31.298]  This is the level of deception in fake news.
[00:28:31.338 --> 00:28:32.139]  It's not even fake news.
[00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:37.584]  It's just raw, base, mindless propaganda that's meant to hype up their base to be violent.
[00:28:41.078 --> 00:28:42.879]  So now, we got Matt Bracken.
[00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:44.039]  He's a former Navy SEAL.
[00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:47.781]  This is a man who's been in war zone environments.
[00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:49.222]  He can tell you what to do.
[00:28:49.282 --> 00:28:51.423]  So I want to roll this video with just a little bit of audio.
[00:28:51.483 --> 00:28:57.906]  And Matt, if you could just comment over what this guy does right, and what he does wrong, and what you should do if you're confronted with this situation.
[00:28:57.946 --> 00:28:59.146]  Alright guys, let's roll the video.
[00:29:00.407 --> 00:29:00.887]  Go ahead, Matt.
[00:29:02.135 --> 00:29:06.556]  First, I would never second-guess the guy because it's easy to say, well, don't be there, you know?
[00:29:07.116 --> 00:29:09.437]  See this mob three blocks back and make a U-turn.
[00:29:09.937 --> 00:29:11.778]  But let's just say it starts with where he is.
[00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:14.358]  Stopping to get out of the car?
[00:29:14.979 --> 00:29:15.519]  Don't do it.
[00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:22.360]  That could have been a fatal thing right there because if a big guy body checks the door, you just broke your ankle or shin.
[00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:23.961]  Now you can't even drive.
[00:29:24.581 --> 00:29:26.342]  So right there, that's a big mistake.
[00:29:26.422 --> 00:29:27.983]  But I mean, I'm not going to second-guess.
[00:29:28.023 --> 00:29:29.664]  The guy looks like a brave old stud.
[00:29:30.144 --> 00:29:33.126]  Guy probably turns out to be, you know, a Vietnam-era war hero.
[00:29:33.746 --> 00:29:35.807]  And he just doesn't back down to mobs.
[00:29:35.847 --> 00:29:37.608]  You know, he sees communists, he wants to fight.
[00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:38.929]  I can appreciate that.
[00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:45.472]  But a few tactics that you can use is, first of all, if you have the choice, get a car with a little bit higher suspension.
[00:29:45.912 --> 00:29:53.276]  You know, going from like a 5-inch ground clearance to an 8 or 10-inch ground clearance means you're going to drive over people and not get stuck.
[00:29:53.776 --> 00:29:54.897]  It's gross, but it's true.
[00:29:55.497 --> 00:30:00.420]  And once you get a little bit of clear space ahead of you, if you gun it like he did, this is good.
[00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:04.143]  Gunning it and stopping, gunning it and stopping it, and also weaving.
[00:30:04.839 --> 00:30:12.388]  Uh, making the car go, like, lurching side to side makes people afraid to run right up to the sides because you've just been doing, like, S-turns down the street.
[00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:23.521]  And once you've cleared the zone, you know, you're going to pro- if you've had people thumping on you, get a few blocks away, just like it was a shooting, and you were the good guy, you're gonna- you want to be the first to call 911.
[00:30:24.842 --> 00:30:30.484]  If somebody takes your picture and you assume it's going to happen, if the police come to your house, it's a hit and run.
[00:30:30.924 --> 00:30:38.427]  If you get three blocks away and you call 911 and describe the scene, just like a good shooting, it puts you way ahead of the game legally.
[00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:44.109]  And then what you need to do once you're talking to the police, I was in fear for my life.
[00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:45.089]  What's today?
[00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:46.530]  I was in fear for my life.
[00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:47.950]  You know, what did you have for breakfast?
[00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:49.191]  I was in fear for my life.
[00:30:50.052 --> 00:30:55.117]  You repeat that until you're lawyered up, and then you shut up and let the lawyer talk.
[00:30:55.638 --> 00:30:59.622]  But what you have to stick with, just like a shooting, I was in fear for my life.
[00:30:59.843 --> 00:31:02.726]  Even if you drove over people, you stick with that.
[00:31:03.166 --> 00:31:10.775]  So don't flee the scene, park a few blocks away in safety, call 911, explain the situation, then you're the good guy because you called it in.
[00:31:11.428 --> 00:31:14.749]  And you explained that you were in a life-or-death situation.
[00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:17.150]  They were pounding on your car, breaking windows.
[00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.390]  You thought they would kill you.
[00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.551]  That's a reasonable assertion.
[00:31:21.411 --> 00:31:27.012]  And in Portland, it might not fly, but it's better than fleeing the scene, then getting arrested as a hit-and-run later.
[00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:28.573]  Because they will have your license.
[00:31:29.542 --> 00:31:32.304]  Yeah, that totally makes sense, everything you said.
[00:31:32.785 --> 00:31:35.967]  And I like the weaving and just going away a few blocks.
[00:31:35.987 --> 00:31:36.968]  And I will make this point.
[00:31:37.928 --> 00:31:42.572]  When this story came out, they said no one had called the cops on either side at that time.
[00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:45.854]  So the news had already figured out that nobody called the cops.
[00:31:46.335 --> 00:31:47.736]  That guy, I totally agree.
[00:31:47.836 --> 00:31:48.456]  Call the cops.
[00:31:48.717 --> 00:31:50.718]  Get it on record that you were the first one to call.
[00:31:51.098 --> 00:31:53.140]  Therefore, you have something at least to fall back on.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:53.881]  I totally agree.
[00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:13.944]  You would be within your rights to drive over those guys.
[00:32:14.345 --> 00:32:17.506]  Because five or six guys in their 20s can put you to the ground.
[00:32:17.706 --> 00:32:20.747]  Once you're on the ground, it's skull stomping time.
[00:32:21.248 --> 00:32:22.588]  And that is a fatal attack.
[00:32:22.688 --> 00:32:25.490]  You're either going to be brain damaged, disfigured, or dead.
[00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.331]  So you cannot go to the ground in a mob.
[00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:29.351]  Don't get out of the car.
[00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:30.612]  Use the car for the weapon.
[00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:33.153]  But then don't do a hit and run and try to get away.
[00:32:33.213 --> 00:32:34.774]  Assume the police will get your license.
[00:32:35.134 --> 00:32:37.695]  So be the first to call 911 and be the good guy.
[00:32:44.719 --> 00:32:47.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:57.725 --> 00:33:06.208]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:06.228 --> 00:33:08.509]  25 days out
[00:33:12.712 --> 00:33:19.758]  And Facebook and Twitter and others have gotten even more bold than I thought they would in censorship.
[00:33:21.159 --> 00:33:26.343]  I predicted that as we got close to the election a year ago that you would see these purges and now you've seen it.
[00:33:27.993 --> 00:33:28.853]  800 just on Facebook.
[00:33:28.873 --> 00:33:34.718]  So when I said earlier 800, excuse me, numbers are now coming out as more groups announce they've been banned.
[00:33:35.618 --> 00:33:47.828]  It looks like it's about 1,600 major, major conservative, libertarian, Christian, pro-gun, pro-veteran, pro-life, just
[00:33:48.857 --> 00:33:54.240]  Just like Project Veritas got documents last year and got video, they said, what are you banning?
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.700]  They said, anything Alex Jones.
[00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:57.141]  He's our main enemy.
[00:33:57.441 --> 00:33:57.941]  Well, what else?
[00:33:57.981 --> 00:34:00.743]  Well, American flags and veterans.
[00:34:02.263 --> 00:34:03.024]  And, you know, scum.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:18.470]  You know, I have talked to, over the years, Secret Service that told us Hillary was collapsing and I said a month before she collapsed that she was collapsing and having seizures all the time and that we should follow her because we'd catch her falling down and indeed, Millie Weaver caught her falling down behind a tent for an hour and a half.
[00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.391]  And then two weeks later she collapsed.
[00:34:20.411 --> 00:34:22.052]  So my point is, these are real sources.
[00:34:23.033 --> 00:34:29.157]  And I have now confirmed from CIA details that protected her,
[00:34:30.765 --> 00:34:32.848]  Blackwater details that protected her, same thing.
[00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:39.296]  Secret service, federal law enforcement, you name it.
[00:34:40.757 --> 00:34:45.003]  And these are people that provide me photos of them with her.
[00:34:45.743 --> 00:34:49.028]  These are people that spent months sometimes overseas with her.
[00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:58.276]  She literally, in situation rooms, tells generals and colonels and people, you are stupid, you're in the military, do not look me in the eye!
[00:34:59.037 --> 00:35:02.760]  Behind the scenes, she is just literally, you think she looks like a demon in public?
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.882]  When she walks around like, ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:35:05.182 --> 00:35:10.747]  She walks into rooms and goes, I am in command of this operation, do as I say, do not even look at me!
[00:35:11.187 --> 00:35:13.989]  Looking like this, and people are just like, what the hell?
[00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.231]  Linda Blair,
[00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:23.194]  Other times she goes into a trance and like cocoons herself on a plane or in a car when they're driving somewhere and says, do not speak to me.
[00:35:23.494 --> 00:35:25.354]  And then goes into like some type of demon trance.
[00:35:26.895 --> 00:35:30.256]  And I've talked to person after person after person.
[00:35:30.476 --> 00:35:32.897]  They said she is demon possessed.
[00:35:33.437 --> 00:35:35.258]  And that's why I started saying that back during the campaign.
[00:35:37.611 --> 00:35:41.454]  Remember what FBI agents that worked in the White House went public from back in the 90s?
[00:35:41.474 --> 00:35:50.062]  They said Hillary would throw marble ashtrays at Clinton and hit him in the head and that she would get so mad that she would beat on the ground and chew the carpet?
[00:35:51.263 --> 00:35:52.584]  Hitler chewed the carpet.
[00:35:54.126 --> 00:35:59.931]  She gets on the ground and convulses satanically so bad that she chews the carpet.
[00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.450]  She hates dogs.
[00:36:03.291 --> 00:36:08.913]  They bring bomb dogs in, and she goes, I told you I hate those filthy, yapping animals.
[00:36:09.174 --> 00:36:10.374]  Get them out of here.
[00:36:10.674 --> 00:36:12.895]  And they're just like, yes ma'am, yes ma'am.
[00:36:13.236 --> 00:36:16.377]  Don't you look at me, you filthy military idiot!
[00:36:17.317 --> 00:36:19.038]  You are mentally retarded!
[00:36:19.058 --> 00:36:22.740]  I am an incredible and alert and a powerful woman!
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.401]  You will respect me!
[00:36:30.609 --> 00:36:34.530]  You cannot exaggerate the full demon force.
[00:36:36.491 --> 00:36:37.651]  She is Linda Blair.
[00:36:38.572 --> 00:36:42.253]  She was already co-president in four administrations.
[00:36:47.695 --> 00:36:48.255]  Let me stop there.
[00:36:48.295 --> 00:36:49.295]  I said I could tell the censorship.
[00:36:51.536 --> 00:36:52.096]  And here's the thing.
[00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:54.877]  It's been said a trillion times that truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:36:55.298 --> 00:36:56.378]  It's real, folks.
[00:36:58.174 --> 00:36:58.815]  Mental illness.
[00:36:59.115 --> 00:37:00.416]  They call it demonic possession.
[00:37:00.496 --> 00:37:07.241]  People being taken over by stuff that acts like Linda Blair or Jack Nicholson and The Shining.
[00:37:08.562 --> 00:37:10.204]  That's what we're dealing with!
[00:37:12.205 --> 00:37:13.887]  She doesn't know what she looks like.
[00:37:14.387 --> 00:37:16.369]  She doesn't know how psychotic she looks.
[00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:18.771]  Because there's no one there.
[00:37:19.491 --> 00:37:20.312]  She is a husk.
[00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.171]  All right, let me stop.
[00:37:32.072 --> 00:37:34.054]  She triggers me, as they say, when they put her on screen.
[00:37:34.074 --> 00:37:36.055]  Remember, we're a radio show that's also syndicated on TV.
[00:37:36.075 --> 00:37:39.978]  If you're a radio listener, you go, why does it keep saying, keep saying, put her on screen, show this, show that?
[00:37:40.218 --> 00:37:41.279]  Those are radio slash TV.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.222]  And without you, InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com will be destroyed.
[00:37:47.383 --> 00:37:50.885]  And then you'll be destroyed, because as I said, they're going to go after everybody.
[00:37:50.945 --> 00:37:55.329]  So I'm going to get into the Jim Brown stuff and more of the censorship next segment.
[00:37:55.469 --> 00:37:58.531]  Let me just say now, before I forget to, because I should be doing this every segment,
[00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:03.833]  Their number one goal is to destroy Infowars.
[00:38:04.754 --> 00:38:16.242]  Because we are putting out the reboot program of America, and Americana, and the spirit of resistance, and our spirit trumps their spirit by unlimited levels.
[00:38:16.863 --> 00:38:19.925]  And so when they hear this transmission, it's grating.
[00:38:20.666 --> 00:38:27.551]  They want to have NPR voices, and, sleep, go to sleep little chicken, as the snake coils around you.
[00:38:30.316 --> 00:38:31.737]  Oh, you don't want to get involved.
[00:38:32.137 --> 00:38:34.138]  Sleepy, sleepy, sleepy.
[00:38:35.038 --> 00:38:37.239]  But now that's not working, so they're trying to intimidate everybody.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.082]  And I really am enraged by their activities.
[00:38:43.262 --> 00:38:44.703]  Not, not, not cowed.
[00:38:44.883 --> 00:38:46.944]  And they are afraid.
[00:38:48.384 --> 00:38:51.506]  Because they want to bring us down, so I want to defeat them.
[00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:56.152]  And they understand, existentially, we have the capabilities.
[00:38:56.832 --> 00:38:57.592]  We have the metal.
[00:38:57.652 --> 00:38:59.613]  We have the political truth.
[00:39:00.453 --> 00:39:02.694]  We have the weapons, politically.
[00:39:02.994 --> 00:39:04.794]  We have the high ground, politically.
[00:39:06.915 --> 00:39:10.456]  Our quiver is filled with razor-sharp truths.
[00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:17.718]  And we have the great Bowman's confidence
[00:39:21.601 --> 00:39:27.163]  To destroy our political enemies, instantly, if ever humanity awakens, and it's happening.
[00:39:28.304 --> 00:39:33.746]  And so this is a very magic time to be alive, but as I told you, and it's not hard to predict, but still, why are we putting up with it?
[00:39:35.547 --> 00:39:36.808]  Why is this unfolding?
[00:39:37.228 --> 00:39:38.248]  Why is this happening?
[00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:41.210]  Because it's a plan!
[00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.650]  Because we're at war!
[00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.332]  The globalists are stealing your birthright, taking over your family,
[00:39:47.392 --> 00:39:48.713]  And putting you into bondage.
[00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.694]  And the beta test was the black community.
[00:39:50.994 --> 00:39:53.956]  They are here to dominate you.
[00:39:56.198 --> 00:39:58.619]  They are taking control.
[00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:02.502]  So, I want to thank the listeners.
[00:40:02.522 --> 00:40:05.344]  You have been supporting us and you've been getting great products at the same time.
[00:40:05.844 --> 00:40:07.265]  It is so essential.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:17.831]  That everyone who hasn't tried the great supplements and the great products go to m4store.com and get award-winning, you know, hardcore politically incorrect t-shirts.
[00:40:17.971 --> 00:40:19.513]  All of it funds the operation.
[00:40:19.894 --> 00:40:24.319]  We have the biggest sale we've ever run, store-wide free shipping and 50% off.
[00:40:26.782 --> 00:40:36.310]  All of the Nutraceuticals, the Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, 4-to-5 Equivalent Silver Iodine, the Brain Force, the X2 that's already selling out last run, but you know what?
[00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:45.777]  They took PayPal, they're trying to take our other payment processors, and they're going to take all the other conservatives' payment processors, and they're going to ban anybody from being able to work or have a job that was in the NRA!
[00:40:46.297 --> 00:40:48.399]  They're announcing it all on Fox News last night!
[00:40:50.761 --> 00:40:52.322]  You don't roll over to that, you fight it!
[00:40:53.294 --> 00:41:02.756]  So, you want to get your supplements and stock up, and get your Christmas gifts right now, because this is Christmas, this is Black Friday, and this is Cyber Monday, all rolled into one.
[00:41:02.976 --> 00:41:05.596]  And we'll have those specials, if we're even around then.
[00:41:06.357 --> 00:41:11.038]  But see, I don't see it as a bad thing for me, whatever happens to us, because they're coming for everyone.
[00:41:11.058 --> 00:41:11.918]  They're at war.
[00:41:12.418 --> 00:41:13.338]  This is serious.
[00:41:14.078 --> 00:41:14.938]  This isn't a game.
[00:41:15.438 --> 00:41:19.799]  So I'm broadcasting and transmitting as hard as I can, because we're actually winning hearts and minds.
[00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:22.580]  But the enemy has the rail lines,
[00:41:23.888 --> 00:41:26.108]  And the telephones, as Stalin said.
[00:41:27.949 --> 00:41:33.890]  That's why they're testing the internet kill switch that they transferred mainly to the UN and the EU and the Chinese three years ago.
[00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.570]  Two and a half years ago, right before Obama left.
[00:41:37.171 --> 00:41:38.011]  Yeah, you heard me right.
[00:41:39.011 --> 00:41:46.552]  It's like the head of Interpol was the number two civilian in the Chinese military, who has all the databases of everybody?
[00:41:46.612 --> 00:41:49.193]  That is the Office of Personnel Management hack.
[00:41:49.793 --> 00:41:50.053]  Interpol.
[00:41:51.493 --> 00:41:51.913]  Well, of course!
[00:41:52.513 --> 00:41:53.954]  Just like the Chi-Coms run Interpol.
[00:41:55.134 --> 00:41:58.475]  They now, with the EU and the UN, have control of ICANN.
[00:41:58.495 --> 00:42:04.837]  They were going to get full control, but now they've only got about 80% control, so they're going to test turning the Internet off tomorrow.
[00:42:07.618 --> 00:42:08.299]  You heard that right.
[00:42:08.979 --> 00:42:11.740]  See, it's not Trump that's getting ready to turn the Internet off.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.280]  It's these people.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.302]  They're getting ready to make a big move, and they're turning everybody's communications off right before they do it.
[00:42:17.342 --> 00:42:20.883]  So it's pretty obvious that this is the big assault.
[00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:23.893]  So, we need Congress with emergency injunctions.
[00:42:23.913 --> 00:42:25.353]  We need the President to take action now.
[00:42:25.873 --> 00:42:27.574]  They're not going to wait until after the election.
[00:42:28.014 --> 00:42:28.894]  They're making their move.
[00:42:28.934 --> 00:42:32.235]  They've got terror teams loading trucks full of bombs right now.
[00:42:32.515 --> 00:42:33.936]  They might not even do false flags.
[00:42:34.136 --> 00:42:38.557]  They might go right to bombing every Republican governor and trying to kill the President in one fell swoop.
[00:42:44.898 --> 00:42:46.520]  Your season has come to an end.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.801]  A new season is here.
[00:42:47.981 --> 00:42:50.783]  Because we know humanity faces big challenges soon.
[00:42:50.803 --> 00:42:51.944]  We have to get ready for those.
[00:42:52.164 --> 00:42:53.525]  We have to get ready to make the jump.
[00:42:53.565 --> 00:42:56.248]  The time for this solar system is coming to an end.
[00:42:56.448 --> 00:42:57.409]  Everything counts down.
[00:42:57.629 --> 00:42:58.550]  Everything's been laid out.
[00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:00.511]  We've got maybe a hundred years to make the jump.
[00:43:00.571 --> 00:43:08.118]  The evil resonates with these low-level people to try to freeze us here and keep us here, delay us here.
[00:43:08.138 --> 00:43:08.798]  It's not happening.
[00:43:09.279 --> 00:43:10.720]  You will not stop the progress.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.681]  Our ancestors, in their
[00:43:13.482 --> 00:43:13.822]  Purity.
[00:43:14.103 --> 00:43:17.785]  And by purity, I mean not pious purity, but genetic purity.
[00:43:18.365 --> 00:43:27.931]  In the raw, primordial system they came from, their will has a dimensional weight that punches through anything these statements do.
[00:43:28.392 --> 00:43:29.552]  We just have to call upon it.
[00:43:30.013 --> 00:43:34.075]  And to these fallen individuals, the will of humanity is a very frightening thing.
[00:43:34.396 --> 00:43:35.936]  It is frightening.
[00:43:36.357 --> 00:43:37.217]  It's the fear of God.
[00:43:37.437 --> 00:43:38.818]  God fashioned us.
[00:43:39.499 --> 00:43:40.439]  Made us in His image.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.621]  Knew us before we were in our mother's womb.
[00:43:44.924 --> 00:43:48.548]  God created these enemies to test these people.
[00:43:49.008 --> 00:43:53.453]  Once you step past them, all of eternity is before you, and it's all a giant loop.
[00:43:53.653 --> 00:43:55.936]  You're like the past, the present, the future, all of it.
[00:43:55.976 --> 00:43:57.838]  And you're like, it's not just the past, the present, the future.
[00:43:57.878 --> 00:43:59.720]  That's only one spectrum, third dimension.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.465]  Then you can delve as deep as you want to go, and you're like, does Satanist want to serve this?
[00:44:04.645 --> 00:44:07.388]  Why the secrets of Satanism take 30 seconds to know.
[00:44:07.608 --> 00:44:14.793]  To even look into the heights of higher dimensions in God is Valhalla to the next level.
[00:44:15.054 --> 00:44:16.955]  And then you wonder, how could they do this?
[00:44:17.275 --> 00:44:20.358]  Because they were given power in this dimension.
[00:44:20.498 --> 00:44:24.060]  And that's what this is, a cosmic con game coming to an end.
[00:44:24.301 --> 00:44:28.043]  And it doesn't mean some utopia comes after this.
[00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:29.144]  That is not what's going to happen.
[00:44:29.785 --> 00:44:31.486]  It's simply the next level.
[00:44:31.826 --> 00:44:35.129]  We'll laugh together when we are at the next level together.
[00:44:36.434 --> 00:44:37.754]  We were worried about that?
[00:44:38.034 --> 00:44:38.914]  Look at that!
[00:44:39.034 --> 00:44:40.455]  Because nothing is given.
[00:44:40.875 --> 00:44:42.095]  Everything has to be achieved.
[00:44:42.315 --> 00:44:43.775]  Although that sounds fantastical.
[00:44:44.195 --> 00:44:45.656]  Have you looked where you are?
[00:44:45.956 --> 00:44:47.196]  You're at the weigh station.
[00:44:48.016 --> 00:44:50.537]  You're at the lily pad, the big pond.
[00:44:50.757 --> 00:44:54.497]  And out beyond is the mountains, the sky, the universe.
[00:44:54.557 --> 00:44:56.918]  It's endless, the potential God's given you.
[00:44:57.258 --> 00:44:58.378]  But it's free will.
[00:44:58.518 --> 00:45:01.839]  But it's very freeing once you have stared over the Misty Mountains.
[00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:03.539]  Once you have seen
[00:45:04.439 --> 00:45:07.502]  The potential, and no, there's really good in the universe, not just evil.
[00:45:07.903 --> 00:45:15.049]  It's a great comfort to know no matter what happens to these little frail bodies, these ugly things, that there's a bigger plan.
[00:45:15.369 --> 00:45:21.495]  Once you get it, you're like, oh my god, this demon thing is telling me how corrupt I am because I have a conscience and I know I'm not perfect.
[00:45:21.775 --> 00:45:22.276]  So I'm listening.
[00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:23.056]  Oh, yeah, I want to be better.
[00:45:23.076 --> 00:45:23.377]  You're right.
[00:45:23.737 --> 00:45:24.438]  But it's a lie.
[00:45:25.138 --> 00:45:34.400]  And once you don't listen to the devil, the accuser, always accusing you, always telling you how you're bad, always telling you how you're failed, always telling you how you're ugly, you're nothing, you're nothing, you're nothing, you're nothing, because it knows you've got a soul.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.140]  It knows you've got that ping.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.461]  It can, it can hack that.
[00:45:37.521 --> 00:45:47.983]  It can send, it doesn't have that, but it knows you've got it, so it just keeps telling you how you're a Nazi and how you're this and how you're that and how you're falling and how you're, so you kind of get off balance and give it your power when the minute
[00:45:49.244 --> 00:45:54.231]  You go, I'm not perfect, but I love God, and I want justice, and I want a future, and I want whatever the next level is.
[00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:55.152]  My God, I can feel it.
[00:45:55.372 --> 00:45:56.294]  Whatever it is, it's good.
[00:45:56.314 --> 00:45:57.675]  I want to go up, not down.
[00:45:57.695 --> 00:45:58.436]  You're free.
[00:45:59.878 --> 00:46:00.379]  Toughness, huh?
[00:46:00.399 --> 00:46:05.426]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up here.
[00:46:11.478 --> 00:46:13.880]  Audi uses a medicinal herb for thousands of years.
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.542]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[00:46:16.923 --> 00:46:22.247]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[00:46:22.267 --> 00:46:30.613]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[00:46:30.953 --> 00:46:35.897]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[00:46:36.437 --> 00:46:38.179]  Right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:38.219 --> 00:46:39.720]  Please support this network.
[00:46:44.605 --> 00:46:48.769]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:10.267]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:23.504 --> 00:47:27.707]  Welcome back to the most banned, most demonized platform program in the world.
[00:47:27.767 --> 00:47:29.508]  But hey, don't worry, we've got lots of company.
[00:47:30.669 --> 00:47:32.430]  Thousands and thousands and thousands.
[00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:37.014]  It was 800 as of this morning in the Washington Post, but now thousands more are coming in.
[00:47:37.074 --> 00:47:39.735]  Some pages with a million followers, some with 300,000 followers.
[00:47:40.036 --> 00:47:44.419]  Michelle Malkin's page, anti-war liberal groups pages being banned.
[00:47:44.479 --> 00:47:48.322]  Anything really political that's real and popular is all being banned.
[00:47:48.402 --> 00:47:49.763]  Mainly conservatives and Christians.
[00:47:50.203 --> 00:47:51.724]  Facebook purges over 800 U.S.
[00:47:51.944 --> 00:47:52.925]  accounts and pages.
[00:47:54.209 --> 00:47:56.050]  From pushing political spam.
[00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.912]  That's right, the Democrats can run around and say, kill and murder everybody.
[00:47:58.952 --> 00:48:04.756]  And if it can have pages run by professors organizing trying to kill Republicans, that's all protected.
[00:48:04.816 --> 00:48:10.799]  Maxine Waters can get up there and say, hound them in restaurants, hound them in gasoline stations, hound them at the mall.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.621]  Don't let them rest, don't let them eat, don't let them do nothing!
[00:48:15.002 --> 00:48:20.926]  The former Attorney General says, when they go low, we go lower and start kicking them, kick them, kick them, fight, fight, fight!
[00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:26.859]  Facebook and Twitter banned popular independent media sites in coordinated purge.
[00:48:26.939 --> 00:48:30.801]  Infowars.com from informationliberation.com.
[00:48:30.961 --> 00:48:35.564]  And you're like, well, you've got your own website.
[00:48:35.604 --> 00:48:36.945]  Let me explain how the architecture works.
[00:48:37.945 --> 00:48:42.027]  15 years ago, 90 plus percent of the web was millions of popular sites, billions of other sites.
[00:48:43.248 --> 00:48:45.529]  An endless island chain, an archipelago.
[00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:48.651]  Incredible diversity.
[00:48:49.692 --> 00:48:51.793]  Then everyone gets their own Facebook, their own Twitter.
[00:48:53.530 --> 00:49:02.557]  Other platforms, and then radio shows and TV shows, they all push to that and push their audiences off their websites onto those platforms.
[00:49:03.978 --> 00:49:04.979]  The platforms swell.
[00:49:05.439 --> 00:49:09.462]  Then they begin slowly censoring, curtailing, blocking, but only when they need to.
[00:49:09.662 --> 00:49:14.566]  Then they went from being arrogant to scared two years ago when Trump won, and so now,
[00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:20.603]  Twenty-five days out from the historic election, they're purging everybody.
[00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:23.825]  But see, now, they know how to titrate the poison dust.
[00:49:23.885 --> 00:49:27.387]  They build it up, build it up, build it up, till you start to kind of like the poison.
[00:49:28.727 --> 00:49:30.308]  First, oh, nobody's censoring.
[00:49:30.588 --> 00:49:32.209]  Oh, there's no conservative sites.
[00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:34.850]  Oh, well, Alex Jones is banned, but he's a hate monger.
[00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.432]  We're going to show you what he said, but oh, now it's spam.
[00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:44.993]  Now we consider it spam that you're posting articles and you have a political view.
[00:49:45.113 --> 00:49:47.655]  Only we're allowed to do that 25 days out.
[00:49:48.335 --> 00:49:49.556]  Oh, and it was 800 yesterday?
[00:49:49.596 --> 00:49:50.976]  How about a few more thousands today?
[00:49:50.996 --> 00:49:53.378]  And then it's just kind of, okay, everybody's banned.
[00:49:53.838 --> 00:49:59.301]  Then they call in Facebook and Twitter execs just a month ago and they're like, no, we don't ban anybody if they're conservative.
[00:50:00.061 --> 00:50:02.122]  We only ban people that are violent or hateful.
[00:50:02.142 --> 00:50:05.744]  And now it's, oh, and spam, which is totally arbitrary to what we want.
[00:50:08.226 --> 00:50:09.567]  Because Congress has not acted!
[00:50:10.548 --> 00:50:17.152]  Because Congress is citizen and Google moved to China, helping their military build AI, won't work with our military, using U.S.
[00:50:17.192 --> 00:50:22.755]  government funding that started Google, In-Q-Tel, the Geospatial Center, and why not?
[00:50:22.815 --> 00:50:35.063]  See, Trump's the president, but Obama and Hillary have their whole network in place, and they've got their executive orders in place from a civil emergency that Trump hasn't revoked, and so they're just sitting there like, we don't exist!
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:40.101]  Trump's done a few things to get the economy going, but they've blocked 90% of what he wants to do.
[00:50:40.121 --> 00:50:46.843]  And then, oh, when he says there's media censorship of conservatives, why, he's attacking the press.
[00:50:47.243 --> 00:50:48.584]  No, they're the ones attacking the press.
[00:50:51.025 --> 00:50:51.765]  So what are you going to do?
[00:50:52.905 --> 00:50:53.625]  What are we going to do?
[00:50:55.086 --> 00:51:04.849]  Because we're at war with China, politically and economically, and we have traitors in our government, in our corporations, that are openly crapping on us and rubbing it in.
[00:51:05.745 --> 00:51:11.887]  That are stealing our birthright and in school education and school programming everywhere.
[00:51:11.907 --> 00:51:14.888]  I'm gonna cover this when we come back.
[00:51:15.888 --> 00:51:23.531]  They're targeting children with the agenda to not have children and to break up the family and that's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the documents, it's in the psychology.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:35.806]  With, quote, sex education and tolerance training, where they take four-year-olds up, three-year-olds up, as a obese man in a wig shakes their butt in their face, and they stick five-dollar bills in their panty line.
[00:51:39.148 --> 00:51:48.493]  And now, this is out of the Daily Mail, gay penguins named Sven and Magic are set to raise their first chick at Requarium Step.
[00:51:48.533 --> 00:51:50.294]  Notice the pair were more than just friends.
[00:51:51.375 --> 00:51:53.416]  So, they see the penguins hanging out.
[00:51:54.278 --> 00:52:02.424]  So they go give them an egg, and then male birds, especially penguins if no one else is around, and some species will take care of eggs.
[00:52:02.804 --> 00:52:04.365]  And so that means they're gay!
[00:52:05.926 --> 00:52:09.889]  Just like men in England, nurses get fired if they don't, come in.
[00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.551]  One nurse said he had very large genitals and tattoos and a beard.
[00:52:13.831 --> 00:52:17.174]  He got up in the stirrups and said, I want you to give me a pap smear.
[00:52:18.277 --> 00:52:21.099]  She was suspended when she said, you, sir, are a male.
[00:52:21.459 --> 00:52:22.359]  You don't have a cervix.
[00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.661]  And the hospital went, no, he does.
[00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:33.686]  So if I said maybe I was a penguin, and he did my beak trimmed, and I go in to a dental office and I say, sir, I'm a penguin.
[00:52:33.966 --> 00:52:35.066]  Will you trim my beak?
[00:52:35.347 --> 00:52:36.948]  Or maybe I'm a chicken.
[00:52:37.608 --> 00:52:38.789]  Will you pluck my feathers?
[00:52:39.509 --> 00:52:41.070]  You don't go to a mental institution.
[00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:41.750]  Oh, no.
[00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:42.531]  Yes, sir.
[00:52:43.051 --> 00:52:44.812]  Let me pluck your feathers out for you.
[00:52:45.052 --> 00:52:46.333]  Here, let me preen your feathers.
[00:52:48.502 --> 00:53:04.026]  This is total war, and you take children who expect adults to give them real leadership and real direction, and you put them in these schools and these systems, and you teach little boys that are five years old you're really a girl, and you're really a boy to a girl, or you can dress however you want, you are screwing them up!
[00:53:05.202 --> 00:53:14.950]  You are taking the existing order of mammal species, and everything that is sacred and real, and you are irrevocably molesting their minds.
[00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:16.811]  You are raping their brains.
[00:53:16.831 --> 00:53:19.013]  You are turning them into mental patients!
[00:53:20.414 --> 00:53:23.116]  And that's the other big thing you're not supposed to talk about.
[00:53:23.296 --> 00:53:24.658]  That's the other big third rail.
[00:53:25.058 --> 00:53:26.779]  Jones, don't talk about radical Islam.
[00:53:28.761 --> 00:53:29.161]  Jones?
[00:53:29.842 --> 00:53:30.282]  Jones?
[00:53:30.842 --> 00:53:33.685]  Don't talk about transgenderism targeting children.
[00:53:35.256 --> 00:53:39.239]  And Jones, don't talk about Communist China and their net censorship.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.861]  Shut up!
[00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:41.922]  Shut up!
[00:53:42.502 --> 00:53:45.024]  And they told everybody, you shut up or you'll be banned like him.
[00:53:45.044 --> 00:53:46.165]  Then they didn't shut up.
[00:53:46.205 --> 00:53:47.907]  They go, OK, we'll just ban all of you.
[00:53:47.927 --> 00:53:48.587]  How do you like that?
[00:53:48.807 --> 00:53:51.029]  Well, hell, last night I'm up here late.
[00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:53.812]  Fox News is on during our own broadcast and I see Tucker Carlson reporting.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:55.580]  We're good to go.
[00:54:14.141 --> 00:54:23.708]  Los Angeles, if you're a member of the NRA, and you're involved in contracting with the government, you must declare it in your contract, or it's fraud, and then we're not going to give you contracts.
[00:54:23.749 --> 00:54:29.473]  So, they're now saying, if you are a gun owner, and you're politically involved, you are banned from contracting.
[00:54:30.013 --> 00:54:31.455]  You are banned from the marketplace.
[00:54:31.495 --> 00:54:32.756]  That's totally illegal!
[00:54:33.256 --> 00:54:33.716]  Oh no!
[00:54:33.997 --> 00:54:35.978]  We're allowed to discriminate for political purposes.
[00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:39.281]  These people are out of control.
[00:54:39.301 --> 00:54:40.061]  There it is, Tucker Carlson.
[00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:41.002]  New LA law.
[00:54:41.022 --> 00:54:43.044]  Will NRA members be allowed to work in Los Angeles?
[00:54:43.942 --> 00:54:44.723]  It's beyond working.
[00:54:44.763 --> 00:54:45.723]  It's getting contracts.
[00:54:47.024 --> 00:54:47.725]  See how it starts?
[00:54:47.745 --> 00:54:49.006]  Remember when they took me off LinkedIn?
[00:54:49.066 --> 00:54:51.667]  And now they're taking other people, other conservatives off LinkedIn.
[00:54:51.948 --> 00:54:56.431]  And Google in California listed all Republicans as in the Nazi Party.
[00:54:58.532 --> 00:54:59.893]  Oh, but there's no political bias.
[00:55:00.113 --> 00:55:01.254]  They're making their move.
[00:55:01.314 --> 00:55:02.115]  We're at war.
[00:55:02.675 --> 00:55:06.638]  And the number one tactic of a real war is you don't tell somebody that they're attacking.
[00:55:07.158 --> 00:55:08.099]  You just run over them.
[00:55:09.497 --> 00:55:17.246]  And as tanks roll over you, they have loudspeakers saying, this is not an assault, we are your friends, lay down your weapons, because a certain percentage will lay them down and go, I give up!
[00:55:17.306 --> 00:55:18.067]  And then you shoot them.
[00:55:18.507 --> 00:55:19.408]  People go, you idiot!
[00:55:20.229 --> 00:55:21.050]  No, they're friends!
[00:55:21.671 --> 00:55:27.257]  Once they buy into the Nigerian email scam, once you buy into the Democrat scam, once you buy into the broadcast...
[00:55:28.484 --> 00:55:36.967]  When the Delta Force was killing the Davidians in Waco, driving in with a tank and shooting them to get rid of them as payback, they had loudspeakers saying, this is not an assault.
[00:55:37.187 --> 00:55:38.008]  This is not an assault.
[00:55:38.188 --> 00:55:39.008]  Come out with your hands up.
[00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:44.430]  And many came out with their hands up and were shot, and then bulldozed back in and gasoline poured on them.
[00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.951]  I know the guys that did it!
[00:55:47.851 --> 00:55:50.452]  So, this is how the world really works.
[00:55:51.613 --> 00:55:52.813]  This is what really goes on.
[00:55:53.474 --> 00:55:54.654]  Stop being childlike.
[00:55:55.554 --> 00:55:56.235]  We are not assaulting.
[00:55:56.255 --> 00:55:57.055]  Come out with your hands up.
[00:55:58.317 --> 00:56:03.379]  Infantry on both sides of the back of the tank shooting the people as they come out, and then bulldozing them into the fire.
[00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:10.621]  And even though you see people being shot, you still want to get out of the fire, so you run out and they shoot you!
[00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:12.781]  This is not an assault.
[00:56:12.961 --> 00:56:13.702]  This is not an assault.
[00:56:13.942 --> 00:56:14.762]  No one's censoring you.
[00:56:15.002 --> 00:56:15.762]  No one's censoring you.
[00:56:15.962 --> 00:56:16.702]  Trump's a Nazi.
[00:56:16.902 --> 00:56:18.183]  Kanye West is a Nazi.
[00:56:19.063 --> 00:56:20.143]  Jim Brown is a Nazi.
[00:56:22.344 --> 00:56:25.365]  And you let these con artists sit there with Hillary's demon smile,
[00:56:27.674 --> 00:56:28.394]  Hi, I'm Hillary!
[00:56:28.995 --> 00:56:29.975]  With Eric Schmidt!
[00:56:30.276 --> 00:56:30.656]  Ha ha!
[00:56:30.976 --> 00:56:31.496]  We love you!
[00:56:31.576 --> 00:56:32.077]  Ha, yeah!
[00:56:32.197 --> 00:56:32.597]  Ha ha!
[00:56:34.498 --> 00:56:36.019]  They should all be arrested!
[00:56:36.219 --> 00:56:37.420]  They sold out to China!
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:38.781]  We're in World War 4!
[00:56:39.081 --> 00:56:40.962]  These are infiltrators, for God's sakes!
[00:56:43.404 --> 00:56:45.085]  Hi, I want to thank God when we come back in the next hour.
[00:56:45.105 --> 00:56:49.307]  I got some really important news yesterday, and I just praise God for all your prayers and all your support.
[00:56:49.327 --> 00:56:50.148]  And I'm going to say it again.
[00:56:51.528 --> 00:56:53.610]  They're trying to financially shut us down, as you know.
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:54.600]  And
[00:57:09.594 --> 00:57:10.134]  We're good to go.
[00:57:48.994 --> 00:57:49.735]  You laughed at me.
[00:57:54.117 --> 00:57:56.499]  You've been in love with something else your whole life.
[00:57:57.419 --> 00:57:58.360]  And this is a love affair.
[00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:02.202]  And so, I'm not gonna get in bed with you.
[00:58:04.764 --> 00:58:07.065]  Because you don't love the spirit of justice.
[00:58:07.785 --> 00:58:09.627]  You love your father the devil.
[00:58:11.107 --> 00:58:13.369]  You love death more than life.
[00:58:14.571 --> 00:58:19.217]  So you go with your father forever.
[00:58:19.738 --> 00:58:20.379]  And that's hell.
[00:58:20.899 --> 00:58:21.941]  Separation from God.
[00:58:24.195 --> 00:58:24.935]  NEVER!
[00:58:25.315 --> 00:58:27.156]  NEVER DEFEAT THE HUMAN SPIRIT!
[00:58:27.336 --> 00:58:29.236]  YOU NEVER DEFEAT GOD!
[00:58:29.316 --> 00:58:30.496]  YOU NEVER WIN!
[00:58:30.516 --> 00:58:31.076]  NEVER!
[00:58:31.156 --> 00:58:31.917]  NEVER EVER!
[00:58:32.017 --> 00:58:36.637]  And this is where we get tested, so REJOICE TO GOD ALMIGHTY!
[00:58:36.717 --> 00:58:45.559]  Did you realize you're coming up with more problems for a troubled creator?
[00:58:45.759 --> 00:58:46.519]  Earthquake.
[00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:48.880]  We're having an earthquake.
[00:59:17.199 --> 00:59:17.760]  It's Lolita!
[00:59:18.601 --> 00:59:20.182]  No, it's Alex Jones!
[00:59:20.503 --> 00:59:21.584]  And he's super pissed!
[01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:06.538]  I say a lot of important stuff, obviously.
[01:00:06.638 --> 01:00:08.019]  These are very important times we're in.
[01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:08.839]  It's not hard.
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.200]  We're in profound times.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.121]  And when we start the next segment, there's something that's really been pressing on me.
[01:00:14.741 --> 01:00:20.022]  A, we've got to seek God's face and discernment, God's mind.
[01:00:21.142 --> 01:00:22.483]  And we also have to
[01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:26.356]  Obviously, humble yourself to do that.
[01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:28.298]  And it's a chicken or the egg thing.
[01:00:28.318 --> 01:00:39.307]  You come into God's presence, you obviously are going to feel pathetic at one level and very small and very bad because of how good and powerful and clean the Spirit is.
[01:00:39.347 --> 01:00:41.849]  But then you also feel better and closer to God.
[01:00:41.869 --> 01:00:48.995]  And then you begin to just enter the mind of God just a little bit and can see the completion and the total mastery.
[01:00:50.876 --> 01:00:51.977]  And the timelessness
[01:00:53.274 --> 01:00:55.957]  And the desire to be with that forever.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.186]  Now, the enemy does not like that spirit, obviously.
[01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:07.807]  It's all about how powerful it is.
[01:01:08.428 --> 01:01:10.309]  It's very infantile, to say the least.
[01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.713]  But I also want to just point this out when we come back.
[01:01:14.834 --> 01:01:16.395]  We are not in normal times.
[01:01:17.776 --> 01:01:19.478]  And the biggest problem facing us
[01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:39.278]  Is the fact that even Trump is projecting too much of himself onto the situation because he wouldn't do the kind of things they're coming up with.
[01:01:41.359 --> 01:01:44.781]  And you have to get into the enemy's mind.
[01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:48.904]  And so just as you have to seek God's mind, I have
[01:01:51.224 --> 01:01:56.847]  sought to not be possessed by, but interface with evil.
[01:01:57.327 --> 01:02:06.211]  Especially when I was younger, I didn't really do it on purpose, but I have definitely interfaced with really, really bad stuff.
[01:02:06.731 --> 01:02:10.413]  And not a lot of folks interface with that and never come back.
[01:02:11.053 --> 01:02:15.675]  So the enemy particularly doesn't like me because I have swam in very deep, dark waters.
[01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:30.038]  And obviously the enemy could project forward to the future and was trying to attach itself to me very early on, but I escaped it through God's grace and through my ancestors that prayed for future generations very intensely.
[01:02:30.999 --> 01:02:43.425]  And so that great reservoir, that reserve of very good people is the only reason I'm here through God's grace.
[01:02:46.766 --> 01:02:50.209]  You know, my mom's mom told me things I already knew, but real mysteries.
[01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:55.134]  Real mysteries of people that really serve God and that founded this country.
[01:02:56.236 --> 01:02:57.937]  And they don't have to meet in secret societies.
[01:02:57.977 --> 01:03:00.400]  They don't have to go around in black cloaks.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.481]  It's not that.
[01:03:01.521 --> 01:03:03.303]  They're close to God and it's like...
[01:03:05.236 --> 01:03:08.677]  Everybody's connected and we know and it's powerful.
[01:03:09.097 --> 01:03:22.542]  And when the enemy presses their pure evil, that's when it activates and it's a chain from us now into the past and our ancestors and then into the future.
[01:03:22.963 --> 01:03:23.663]  And it's electrical.
[01:03:25.183 --> 01:03:31.966]  So you physically touch your most ancient ancestor through your mother, your father down the line.
[01:03:32.779 --> 01:03:37.403]  That's why the enemy wants to break that with artificial humanoids, artificial biologicals.
[01:03:38.724 --> 01:03:41.926]  But it's been documented that they're always aggressive, evil, soulless.
[01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:45.389]  But that's why they want five fathers, five mothers.
[01:03:45.529 --> 01:03:46.549]  These aren't going to be humans.
[01:03:47.366 --> 01:03:55.873]  So the whole transhumanist movement goes into the world of, you won't be able to criticize things that are made by companies and laboratories and factories.
[01:03:56.734 --> 01:04:03.599]  And all these movies about replicants and, oh, they're poor things and we need to be nice to the genetically engineered creatures and, you know, they're better than us.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:12.407]  They're all preparing you for the robots and the synthetics and the biological androids to have supremacy over us.
[01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:20.418]  But to do that, they've got to stunt us and poison us and sterilize us so that we need to use them like a cane.
[01:04:22.179 --> 01:04:26.263]  And I mean, you know, the Tinker Toys they show you from Boston Dynamics that can now climb up a ceiling.
[01:04:26.843 --> 01:04:28.885]  You can see how it's exponentially getting more dangerous.
[01:04:29.325 --> 01:04:30.967]  And these armies will follow orders.
[01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:37.733]  And just like calculators remove humans' ability to do math, this will make all of our manhood vestigial.
[01:04:38.073 --> 01:04:40.035]  So manhood's being removed because we're being spiked.
[01:04:46.232 --> 01:04:51.366]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[01:04:51.727 --> 01:04:53.812]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[01:04:55.794 --> 01:05:04.780]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasting radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:05.141 --> 01:05:11.365]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[01:05:11.865 --> 01:05:16.689]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:18.030]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.090]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:19.891]  Apple banned your app.
[01:05:19.911 --> 01:05:20.231]  I helped, too!
[01:05:20.251 --> 01:05:20.491]  Ah, Oliver.
[01:05:20.511 --> 01:05:21.872]  I hate free speech, too!
[01:05:21.912 --> 01:05:22.432]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:23.273]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:23.293 --> 01:05:23.693]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:23.713 --> 01:05:24.173]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:24.713]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:25.534]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:26.054]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:27.195]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:27.495 --> 01:05:28.075]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:28.095 --> 01:05:29.116]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:29.136 --> 01:05:29.556]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:29.576 --> 01:05:29.976]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:29.996 --> 01:05:30.416]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:30.436 --> 01:05:30.877]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:30.897 --> 01:05:31.317]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:31.337 --> 01:05:31.897]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:32.418]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:32.438 --> 01:05:32.958]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:33.018 --> 01:05:33.798]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:33.838 --> 01:05:34.279]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:34.299 --> 01:05:34.819]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:35.339]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:35.759]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:35.779 --> 01:05:36.300]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:36.720]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:37.120]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:37.580]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.001]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:38.461]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:38.481 --> 01:05:38.921]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:38.941 --> 01:05:39.361]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:39.381 --> 01:05:39.842]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:39.862 --> 01:05:40.282]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:40.302 --> 01:05:40.802]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:40.822 --> 01:05:41.222]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:41.242 --> 01:05:44.944]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:44.964 --> 01:05:45.344]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:45.364 --> 01:05:45.765]  We hate free speech!
[01:05:45.785 --> 01:05:46.165]  We hate free speech
[01:05:52.725 --> 01:05:56.648]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:05:57.568 --> 01:06:02.532]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:23.857]  Well, here we are, second hour, kicking it off.
[01:06:23.877 --> 01:06:27.640]  I'm going to give the number out, so you're taking your calls at the bottom of the hour throughout the rest of the broadcast.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.421]  And here's the big announcement.
[01:06:32.624 --> 01:06:33.644]  On multiple fronts.
[01:06:37.067 --> 01:06:42.772]  I know who's running for president of the Democratic Party, and I know who's already been given the nomination just like three years ago.
[01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:44.793]  And I know who Hillary's running mate is.
[01:06:46.443 --> 01:06:51.626]  So, I said I'd get to it last night, didn't, said I'd get to it last hour, didn't, so I'm going to get to it right now.
[01:06:52.367 --> 01:07:10.278]  I have been told by the Secret Service, and I have been told by the CIA, and I have been told by people at Blackwater, and I have been told by people in the Democratic Party, but I have been told by people that have been there at the houses, at the meeting halls, at the facilities, the ticket now is not Joe Biden.
[01:07:12.625 --> 01:07:16.588]  The ticket is Hillary Clinton because she owns the Democratic Party with George Soros.
[01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:24.134]  And you've heard rumors of this and you've seen even Democrat newspapers say, well, she's looking at it and they're saying, please don't.
[01:07:24.194 --> 01:07:24.854]  She doesn't care.
[01:07:24.894 --> 01:07:25.715]  She does what she wants.
[01:07:25.855 --> 01:07:26.455]  She's tone deaf.
[01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:28.437]  She's a power man.
[01:07:29.157 --> 01:07:31.179]  But guess who's going to run with her?
[01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:36.483]  They've already announced that Michelle Obama is looking to run right now.
[01:07:37.864 --> 01:07:45.268]  They are looking at another co-presidency, it's the way these power groups do it, where it was Bill and Hillary for two terms, then Hillary and Obama for two terms.
[01:07:45.288 --> 01:07:48.130]  She's been president, co-president, even liberals admit that.
[01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:53.993]  They even call her Mrs. President, Madam President, in the emails, going back years ago.
[01:07:54.013 --> 01:07:56.835]  People say, why do they call her the president?
[01:07:56.855 --> 01:07:58.616]  Because she's been the president, co-president.
[01:08:00.297 --> 01:08:04.299]  That she will then be able to serve, she believes, six terms.
[01:08:06.617 --> 01:08:08.319]  Six terms.
[01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:12.523]  Hillary and Michelle Obama.
[01:08:13.444 --> 01:08:18.208]  And I've been given this by the CIA.
[01:08:18.849 --> 01:08:20.390]  And I mean real people in the CIA.
[01:08:20.911 --> 01:08:26.716]  Not leftist pencil pushers and, you know, academics that all have a little card in their wallet so they can act tough and cool.
[01:08:27.797 --> 01:08:30.340]  You know, like the people they have testifying before Congress and making up lies.
[01:08:31.715 --> 01:08:33.636]  We're talking about the real people that are there.
[01:08:34.356 --> 01:08:35.897]  And CENTCOM, whole nine yards.
[01:08:36.297 --> 01:08:36.858]  It's done.
[01:08:38.078 --> 01:08:39.479]  Democrats are being told this is it.
[01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:41.520]  You're like, wow, that doesn't sound very Democratic.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.361]  Sanders won all the first primaries and won California.
[01:08:45.782 --> 01:08:47.503]  They gave the delegates to Hillary, remember?
[01:08:49.164 --> 01:08:51.485]  They tried to do that against Trump, but we didn't stand for it.
[01:08:52.005 --> 01:08:53.846]  We didn't go along with it.
[01:08:55.887 --> 01:08:57.408]  We would not bow down to this.
[01:08:58.808 --> 01:08:59.569]  And so, it's done.
[01:09:00.897 --> 01:09:01.698]  That sounds insane.
[01:09:02.278 --> 01:09:07.042]  It's all about divisional politics and everything is about dividing men and women and families.
[01:09:08.583 --> 01:09:12.005]  And so the same job they did on the black community in the last 50 years is already being done to everybody else.
[01:09:13.146 --> 01:09:17.209]  And they're going to run the corpse.
[01:09:19.231 --> 01:09:20.732]  The brain in the bubbling jar.
[01:09:21.773 --> 01:09:23.314]  Like Matt Drudge said a decade ago.
[01:09:25.936 --> 01:09:28.798]  And just like Roosevelt was in a wheelchair and super sick,
[01:09:29.633 --> 01:09:30.534]  But he was still the president.
[01:09:30.594 --> 01:09:31.955]  Their belief is it doesn't matter.
[01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:33.356]  She can be in a wheelchair.
[01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:34.497]  They'll just say she isn't.
[01:09:34.757 --> 01:09:35.777]  You'll all see the wheelchair.
[01:09:35.798 --> 01:09:38.199]  And they'll say, well, that's not a wheelchair.
[01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:40.501]  Remember, she fell down on her face.
[01:09:40.521 --> 01:09:41.502]  They said she didn't fall down.
[01:09:41.842 --> 01:09:43.023]  Alex Jones is fake news.
[01:09:43.863 --> 01:09:46.465]  MSNBC actually said Alex Jones is fake news.
[01:09:46.505 --> 01:09:47.886]  Look, she only stumbled.
[01:09:48.086 --> 01:09:51.709]  And they cut off her falling on her face and being picked up and put in the vehicle.
[01:09:52.009 --> 01:09:52.770]  Having a convulsion.
[01:10:01.946 --> 01:10:03.766]  So you think about that, long and hard.
[01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:05.327]  That's what's about to happen.
[01:10:06.607 --> 01:10:08.768]  And you say, well no one will put up with that.
[01:10:08.848 --> 01:10:16.130]  They're killing now, not just tens of thousands of conservative sites the last few months, and then thousands in the last day.
[01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:17.670]  That's the big news on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:19.691]  Or we're just used to it now.
[01:10:19.791 --> 01:10:21.311]  See, Congress doesn't act, so we get worse.
[01:10:23.832 --> 01:10:28.473]  They're purging all of the real liberal sites that are socially liberal on some issues, tolerant.
[01:10:29.428 --> 01:10:30.368]  But that are anti-war.
[01:10:30.888 --> 01:10:34.329]  I looked at the list, and some of these have millions of followers.
[01:10:34.349 --> 01:10:35.610]  300,000 followers.
[01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.970]  800,000 followers.
[01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:37.330]  Dan Dix, the filmmaker, you name it.
[01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.191]  They're all being banned, too.
[01:10:40.751 --> 01:10:44.673]  Because they actually report objectively.
[01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:48.154]  And they have followings, and the establishment doesn't like that.
[01:10:48.394 --> 01:10:49.354]  They want full control.
[01:10:49.614 --> 01:10:51.435]  And so, Alex Jones was a test case.
[01:10:52.755 --> 01:10:55.316]  Chewing, lie about him, demonizing for years.
[01:10:56.673 --> 01:11:19.699]  Hundreds of thousands of articles, literally, thousands of TV programs, dozens of TV shows, Homeland, based on Alex Jones, Ramen Evil, Criminal, Comedy Central shows, all of it, to turn me into a demon, in the eyes of the public, so that I could then be destroyed, which we're in the process of doing here, so that we're all taught how it's done,
[01:11:21.067 --> 01:11:22.147]  And I'm the test case.
[01:11:22.267 --> 01:11:22.968]  I'm the test pilot.
[01:11:23.368 --> 01:11:38.133]  See, just like I'm the test pilot for bringing out the hardcore ideas that are real, that no one else has the courage to do, and I put myself in this position and proven I know what I'm doing, and so I'm here and I'm willing to do it, because somebody's got to volunteer.
[01:11:38.153 --> 01:11:39.954]  I'm not saying I'm a hero here.
[01:11:39.994 --> 01:11:41.135]  We have no future if we don't do it.
[01:11:42.835 --> 01:11:49.938]  I mean, I use the cheesy Wrath of Khan analogy that the big Genesis bomb's about to go off.
[01:11:50.734 --> 01:12:01.123]  And it's gonna kill everybody on both ships, cause Khan's dying and he wants to kill Captain Kirk and the Enterprise, and Spock goes down on the reactor and fixes the ship, because everybody's gonna die if he doesn't.
[01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:03.966]  It's either everybody dies, or I die.
[01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:08.490]  Now, if more of us acted like that, I wouldn't have to die.
[01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:13.995]  But I'll tell you right now, when I talk about death, I mean my name, my treasure, everything.
[01:12:16.806 --> 01:12:18.747]  Because we lose everything anyways.
[01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.067]  There's not even a thought in my mind.
[01:12:21.107 --> 01:12:22.128]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:12:22.408 --> 01:12:23.348]  I'm extremely honored.
[01:12:25.289 --> 01:12:28.530]  Because when you behave like that, that's when God opens the doors.
[01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:32.671]  And that's when Providence raises its beautiful face.
[01:12:33.212 --> 01:12:34.832]  And that's when you get closer to God.
[01:12:34.952 --> 01:12:36.513]  And that's what's valuable.
[01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:37.813]  Not money, not power.
[01:12:37.993 --> 01:12:38.133]  No.
[01:12:38.713 --> 01:12:38.973]  Money.
[01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:39.474]  Power.
[01:12:39.534 --> 01:12:42.014]  That's all to be used judiciously to help people.
[01:12:42.335 --> 01:12:43.295]  Money is only fuel.
[01:12:44.906 --> 01:12:49.110]  To build a civilization, not to sit back with a bunch of bling.
[01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:52.894]  And there's nothing wrong with bling if it isn't your God.
[01:12:53.895 --> 01:12:57.679]  It's okay to celebrate God's providence and success, but it's not your God.
[01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.200]  And you don't sell out for it.
[01:12:59.841 --> 01:13:02.924]  When you don't sell out, you get all the wealth and all the power.
[01:13:03.665 --> 01:13:07.669]  When you do sell out, you end up losing your children and your whole world and your whole life.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:19.843]  And there's a spirit of evil being poured out in the world right now, and there are people resonating with the evil spiritually, and there are people who are interfacing with true evil.
[01:13:21.324 --> 01:13:22.524]  The devil's working overtime.
[01:13:22.804 --> 01:13:23.164]  It's real.
[01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:27.626]  Everybody knows it.
[01:13:33.393 --> 01:13:34.775]  We're not in normal times.
[01:13:35.616 --> 01:13:37.099]  We're not in normal times.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.522]  And that's one of Trump's only problems.
[01:13:39.863 --> 01:13:40.584]  And my problem too.
[01:13:42.006 --> 01:13:47.394]  We get so set in the daily routine and we get used to the left's violence and their threats and all the horrible things they do.
[01:13:51.243 --> 01:14:00.626]  And then we just kind of adapt to being abused, and then when they hit us with the full dose, when they finally ramp it up, which they're doing, I think they're going to attack in the next 25 days.
[01:14:01.086 --> 01:14:02.486]  Unless we get the word out and stop them.
[01:14:02.546 --> 01:14:11.669]  I don't think, I know, you see the mass bomber that admits he was going to blow up the mall with 200 pounds of explosives and kill potentially thousands of people, and he's a big leftist, the media covers that up.
[01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:20.832]  They're activating, through the propaganda, through the brainwashing, through the media, the most manipulatable, suggestible people.
[01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:24.932]  They're now being pushed to go out and be violent and to target.
[01:14:25.872 --> 01:14:26.773]  Just like advertising.
[01:14:27.453 --> 01:14:31.215]  They know they put a certain beer commercial on, they're gonna sell X amount of beer to this group.
[01:14:32.356 --> 01:14:40.461]  Well you go out and say the Republicans or Nazis kill them or everybody's gonna die, and you see authority figures saying that on every channel, and the president's a white supremacist.
[01:14:41.598 --> 01:14:46.799]  You're going to have people try to blow the White House up when Madonna's saying, I think a lot about blowing the White House up.
[01:14:47.099 --> 01:14:57.242]  Why do you think they're all up there every day saying, kill, kill, kill, and then lying about me and saying I'm saying go out and kill them with no proof is to then add, oh look, Jones says he's coming to kill you.
[01:14:57.262 --> 01:15:00.603]  So they go, I'm not going to put up with that.
[01:15:00.683 --> 01:15:01.443]  I'm going to kill you.
[01:15:06.704 --> 01:15:13.466]  You know how bold it is when every major news channel in the country, National News said, Jones said, get battle rifles and go kill the media.
[01:15:13.766 --> 01:15:14.806]  No clip, no nothing!
[01:15:15.126 --> 01:15:16.666]  That's war propaganda, man!
[01:15:16.706 --> 01:15:18.647]  That means they're going for broke, baby!
[01:15:18.987 --> 01:15:20.987]  You think I'm worried about my office and me?
[01:15:21.587 --> 01:15:23.428]  I'm worried about the whole world, baby!
[01:15:23.468 --> 01:15:24.768]  They're coming for everybody!
[01:15:25.008 --> 01:15:26.308]  It ain't just Alex Jones!
[01:15:26.588 --> 01:15:28.629]  This is the big final globalist assault!
[01:15:29.509 --> 01:15:33.935]  And the Pentagon, and the military, and the police, and the public, everybody better get ready!
[01:15:34.416 --> 01:15:35.998]  Because this is the big one, people!
[01:15:36.258 --> 01:15:37.440]  They're coming over the top!
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:38.601]  That's bayonets!
[01:15:45.891 --> 01:15:46.471]  Did you hear?
[01:15:46.852 --> 01:15:48.332]  Christmas is coming in October.
[01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:50.333]  Black Friday's coming in October.
[01:15:50.854 --> 01:15:52.514]  Cyber Monday's coming in October.
[01:15:52.555 --> 01:15:59.298]  What's really coming in October is incredible deals, 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping.
[01:16:00.038 --> 01:16:07.202]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down InfoWars.com and to shut down your voice.
[01:16:07.702 --> 01:16:12.605]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want InfoWars to go the way of the Dodo Bird.
[01:16:13.749 --> 01:16:17.251]  For the way the dinosaurs, because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[01:16:18.372 --> 01:16:28.237]  Now you've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us, and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away, and to be able to take our banking away, so we can't even process orders.
[01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:33.680]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:38.823]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[01:16:40.504 --> 01:16:53.841]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[01:16:54.421 --> 01:16:58.546]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[01:16:59.733 --> 01:17:05.095]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:07.435]  Black Friday's coming early.
[01:17:07.495 --> 01:17:08.596]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[01:17:08.816 --> 01:17:14.778]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[01:17:15.378 --> 01:17:20.739]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:28.982]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:32.072]  M4 Wars is in your hands.
[01:17:33.303 --> 01:17:39.688]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report.
[01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:43.490]  We went ahead and did video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:48.374]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:52.076]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[01:17:52.697 --> 01:17:57.660]  And so now they're coming after our ability, InfoWarsTore.com, to even have credit card processing.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:00.962]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[01:18:01.983 --> 01:18:03.144]  Get your X2.
[01:18:03.384 --> 01:18:06.167]  Even though it's selling out the last run, 50% off.
[01:18:06.507 --> 01:18:08.389]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[01:18:08.749 --> 01:18:10.230]  Super Melodoxality, 50% off.
[01:18:10.911 --> 01:18:12.532]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[01:18:12.572 --> 01:18:14.934]  Now, I do that with air filtration, water filtration.
[01:18:15.314 --> 01:18:18.737]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[01:18:18.978 --> 01:18:23.261]  And, free shipping, store-wide, MFOMoreStore.com.
[01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:26.024]  So, this is the October
[01:18:27.535 --> 01:18:28.976]  Black Friday coming early.
[01:18:29.376 --> 01:18:30.557]  This is Christmas coming early.
[01:18:30.937 --> 01:18:32.519]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.
[01:18:32.619 --> 01:18:34.660]  This is Christmas in October.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.343]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great.
[01:18:38.403 --> 01:18:39.243]  The five-star ratings.
[01:18:39.764 --> 01:18:41.245]  And go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts.
[01:18:41.265 --> 01:18:42.726]  So that you have them.
[01:18:42.886 --> 01:18:44.147]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[01:18:44.167 --> 01:18:45.388]  Christmas is only two months away.
[01:18:46.168 --> 01:18:48.790]  And you can support the M4 War while getting great products to win-win.
[01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:49.871]  I'm counting on you.
[01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:50.831]  You've always come through.
[01:18:51.272 --> 01:18:52.432]  They know you always come through.
[01:18:52.733 --> 01:18:55.715]  Which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[01:18:56.375 --> 01:19:01.120]  With a five-star rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:04.022]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[01:19:04.102 --> 01:19:04.823]  Nobody's got that.
[01:19:05.564 --> 01:19:06.405]  Credit card processing.
[01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:08.867]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[01:19:09.127 --> 01:19:09.708]  We expose them.
[01:19:09.908 --> 01:19:13.832]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.
[01:19:15.578 --> 01:19:20.941]  We're in some serious time because we've been effective, we've been strong, we've been forceful, we've been successful.
[01:19:20.981 --> 01:19:22.761]  You've been successful by supporting us.
[01:19:22.801 --> 01:19:30.665]  So, InfoWareStore.com, InfoWareLife.com, today, in this mega sale, 50% off free shipping, to help bring the InfoWare to the next level.
[01:19:30.885 --> 01:19:31.786]  I'm counting on you.
[01:19:32.046 --> 01:19:32.946]  You always come through.
[01:19:33.287 --> 01:19:34.047]  Take advantage of this.
[01:19:34.067 --> 01:19:36.228]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:49.623]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:01.871 --> 01:20:04.613]  You've got to have an ace in the hole.
[01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:08.536]  A little secret that nobody knows.
[01:20:11.264 --> 01:20:16.206]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:16.226 --> 01:20:20.787]  You're listening to the most banned, most lied about, most demonized broadcast in the world by the Chi-Coms.
[01:20:21.047 --> 01:20:26.269]  Their media openly attacks me, calls me to be shut down, by the Hollywood trash, by the entire establishment.
[01:20:26.869 --> 01:20:32.811]  I'm a loyal American, and I'm loyal to the Bill of Rights Constitution and to our open, free society that's under attack.
[01:20:34.012 --> 01:20:36.792]  And a lot of powerful elites sold our country out.
[01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:38.133]  They parlayed it into global government.
[01:20:39.836 --> 01:20:44.199]  And if they were building a world government of peace and freedom, I'd still be worried about it, because a dictator could take that over.
[01:20:44.219 --> 01:20:48.282]  It's authoritarian, but out of the gate, it's anti-family, anti-human.
[01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:52.745]  It wants full control over the life process, the life cycle.
[01:20:53.806 --> 01:20:58.749]  Everything is targeting our fertility, our health.
[01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:00.571]  We are under globalist attack.
[01:21:00.671 --> 01:21:04.954]  And Trump represents a pro-human future and a human future.
[01:21:06.275 --> 01:21:09.217]  And that's why they see him as an archaic,
[01:21:10.745 --> 01:21:11.806]  Bumbling booby.
[01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:16.428]  They know they could do the same things Trump's done and turn the economy on.
[01:21:16.648 --> 01:21:17.489]  They don't want that.
[01:21:18.069 --> 01:21:19.610]  They want you poor under their control.
[01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:20.791]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:21:21.191 --> 01:21:23.912]  And I always say that because we forget what's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:21:25.693 --> 01:21:28.155]  It's one reason they want internet censorship because they're afraid of new leaks.
[01:21:28.495 --> 01:21:29.375]  It's all there.
[01:21:30.856 --> 01:21:32.217]  How they want to keep you poor.
[01:21:32.497 --> 01:21:33.558]  How they want to keep you dumb.
[01:21:33.778 --> 01:21:35.018]  How they don't want you to have a family.
[01:21:35.419 --> 01:21:36.379]  How they want full control.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.381]  How they want low IQ idiots they can run.
[01:21:41.477 --> 01:21:42.498]  So, I'm going to say it again.
[01:21:42.738 --> 01:21:52.286]  All of these crazy, wild-eyed leftists who are promised this utopia and go into debt to get these worthless degrees they know are worthless, they're not going to school to get a degree.
[01:21:52.306 --> 01:21:53.927]  They're going to school to be re-educated.
[01:21:55.608 --> 01:21:56.409]  To be brainwashed.
[01:21:57.430 --> 01:22:04.735]  And then they're turned loose as these big, entitled, spoiled brats to run around like political officers and commissars.
[01:22:06.637 --> 01:22:09.419]  And it's nasty, nasty, nasty.
[01:22:12.941 --> 01:22:19.945]  And as they realize they're going to lose the midterms, they are censoring and shutting everything down.
[01:22:20.385 --> 01:22:21.326]  I want to give the number out.
[01:22:21.986 --> 01:22:23.047]  I want to have people call in.
[01:22:23.067 --> 01:22:32.892]  I want to say first-time callers in the first round, or people that have called in and didn't get to get on when you were on hold, those folks go to the front of the line.
[01:22:32.912 --> 01:22:39.916]  On the incredible race baiting and the incredible demonization of Kanye West and Mr. Brown and Mr. Trump,
[01:22:42.219 --> 01:22:54.842]  And the Facebook and Twitter purges of thousands of pages is not 800, of prominent groups coordinated on the same day, and that's just the beginning, and that Congress must act, you must call the White House, you must, this is coordinated cartelling!
[01:22:57.443 --> 01:23:06.805]  If any industry gets together to fix prices, or to deny certain groups from the marketplace, that's illegal unless it's Congress passing sanctions!
[01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:14.054]  The left, the big banks, Hollywood, big tech, the Democratic Party are putting sanctions on conservatives.
[01:23:14.454 --> 01:23:23.320]  They're in CBS News last night saying you may not be able to work in the city of Los Angeles or get a contract if you are an NRA member.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:27.862]  And they're making you sign a contract that you aren't.
[01:23:28.783 --> 01:23:30.064]  You know how illegal that is?
[01:23:30.324 --> 01:23:31.224]  But why not?
[01:23:32.645 --> 01:23:36.748]  They're so bold in California, multiple cities have passed laws that illegal aliens can vote.
[01:23:37.762 --> 01:23:39.985]  How do you pass a law that violates federal law?
[01:23:43.069 --> 01:23:43.810]  You understand?
[01:23:44.091 --> 01:23:48.337]  We're in the middle of their revolution against what's left of America.
[01:23:49.038 --> 01:23:50.159]  Trump is a desperate
[01:23:51.138 --> 01:24:01.880]  Rearguard action to just slow the thing down while we're pushed towards the edge of a cliff, while he hopes other people, hey, let's come together, one flag, you know, prosperity, God, we're about to really be destroyed.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:03.060]  Why would you want to be poor?
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.081]  Why would you want race wars for the Chi-Com?
[01:24:05.301 --> 01:24:06.761]  Stop, please, let's be, come on.
[01:24:07.221 --> 01:24:07.561]  No!
[01:24:08.742 --> 01:24:13.122]  Bulldozing us over the edge of a cliff, and Trump sliding, sliding towards the edge of the cliff.
[01:24:16.283 --> 01:24:20.624]  And you've got the hordes, like, battering down the castle gates.
[01:24:24.321 --> 01:24:31.307]  And then the very throngs that are battering down the castle gates are going to destroy their own future.
[01:24:32.047 --> 01:24:35.650]  But they'd rather burn the castle because it's too pretty.
[01:24:36.211 --> 01:24:36.951]  It works too well.
[01:24:37.792 --> 01:24:41.195]  They have existential envy of the fortress.
[01:24:42.796 --> 01:24:47.700]  And they want to pull it down to metaphysically, they believe, absorb it and become it.
[01:24:48.973 --> 01:24:58.241]  Just as South Pacific natives believe they eat the heart of a strong man or the brain of a wise man, they take on the essence.
[01:24:58.301 --> 01:25:00.583]  And of course, it's called black magic.
[01:25:01.544 --> 01:25:02.525]  It's called voodoo.
[01:25:02.605 --> 01:25:04.527]  It's called evil.
[01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:06.889]  And that's what it is.
[01:25:07.898 --> 01:25:15.046]  They don't want, the globalists don't want to take over the strongest nations and then export that strength and then rise the whole civilization.
[01:25:15.086 --> 01:25:22.934]  They're not conquering things to build aqueducts and build libraries and public baths and medicine and literature.
[01:25:23.595 --> 01:25:26.458]  No, they come to destroy that, to burn it up!
[01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:30.951]  In their own creed.
[01:25:32.071 --> 01:25:33.472]  You want to see the future, Winston?
[01:25:33.932 --> 01:25:35.973]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:25:36.233 --> 01:25:38.894]  We don't want a society that lives longer, is more beautiful or better.
[01:25:38.914 --> 01:25:41.915]  We want one that's uglier and more short-lived.
[01:25:42.235 --> 01:25:44.356]  We love trampling and being trampled upon, Winston.
[01:25:44.776 --> 01:25:49.939]  You know, Winston, you look at my face as I torture you and you see my black circles around my eyes and my chipped teeth.
[01:25:51.039 --> 01:25:52.999]  You think, man, your establishment's weak.
[01:25:53.439 --> 01:25:58.800]  No, no, my establishment's strong because I was once a very handsome, you know, very smart, good, altruistic person.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:05.862]  But I joined the party and turned my soul over to ripping souls out so that I can be a true evil priest of power, Winston.
[01:26:05.962 --> 01:26:08.402]  I am committed to total darkness, Winston.
[01:26:09.042 --> 01:26:16.304]  And when I'm done, you're going to be a mentally ill, gibbering idiot that believes 2 plus 2 is whatever I say it is with your rotting teeth pulled out.
[01:26:16.824 --> 01:26:17.884]  And then I'm going to stick you
[01:26:18.684 --> 01:26:31.696]  In a little bar to drink synthetic gin and worship Big Brother in front of a telescreen until we finally take you and blow your brains out and throw you into a furnace and your name is erased from the history books and your gas is shot up into the atmosphere.
[01:26:32.617 --> 01:26:35.359]  We are gonna suck your soul, boy!
[01:26:37.141 --> 01:26:39.003]  So your soul goes right into hell!
[01:26:39.623 --> 01:26:43.307]  We're gonna get your soul and take it down to those lower dimensions and you're gone forever.
[01:26:44.091 --> 01:26:49.975]  And I'm going to use up your fear and I'm going to suck the energy out of you because I'm a vampire.
[01:26:49.995 --> 01:26:51.396]  Do you understand that, boy?
[01:26:51.416 --> 01:27:00.722]  Think we might want to protect our children from these people?
[01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:12.435]  If someone told you 30 years ago they'd be teaching five-year-old boys that they're really girls and girls that they're boys, and have all these weird little liberal families doing it, these are pervert families!
[01:27:13.136 --> 01:27:14.836]  This is pedophilia out in the open!
[01:27:19.219 --> 01:27:24.062]  This is the reality of what's going on, because the essence is vampirism.
[01:27:25.923 --> 01:27:27.604]  Psychic, kinetic,
[01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:32.651]  Energetic, soul-sucking, energy-destroying.
[01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:58.759]  If you could take the potential of a child, and their whole genetic line, and what they would develop normally, go through rites of passage, and you could steal that and confuse them and make them mentally ill, it's even better than sacrificing them and drinking their blood, because you can sacrifice the entire energy line of their entire family line, and then you can have them, as a new disease mode, infect others, because the vampirism will only try to take on more
[01:27:59.219 --> 01:27:59.900]  More prey.
[01:28:06.683 --> 01:28:07.984]  This is a vampire invasion.
[01:28:09.205 --> 01:28:16.709]  A psychic, interdimensional, intergalactic, multivariate system.
[01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:28.036]  Set up in a hierarchy of vampires, in a huge energetic program, a satanic matrix, sucking your energy and breaking your will,
[01:28:30.006 --> 01:28:30.426]  For Satan.
[01:28:32.308 --> 01:28:33.989]  All done to blaspheme God.
[01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:37.031]  Because the devil knows he's a loser.
[01:28:37.952 --> 01:28:38.853]  I'll give the number out when we come back.
[01:28:40.845 --> 01:28:46.590]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:50.914]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[01:28:51.354 --> 01:28:53.556]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[01:28:53.596 --> 01:28:55.718]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[01:28:56.058 --> 01:28:58.060]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:28:58.841]  Boom!
[01:28:59.121 --> 01:29:01.363]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[01:29:01.723 --> 01:29:03.284]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[01:29:03.344 --> 01:29:05.166]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:06.327]  You still have a shop front.
[01:29:06.527 --> 01:29:07.328]  And then what do we see?
[01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:08.349]  Washington Post.
[01:29:08.909 --> 01:29:12.030]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%.
[01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:16.511]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[01:29:16.531 --> 01:29:19.352]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[01:29:19.672 --> 01:29:25.073]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:29.914]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is.
[01:29:30.254 --> 01:29:32.379]  To fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:36.128]  We're not funded by dull state dictatorships like CNN is.
[01:29:36.389 --> 01:29:37.471]  We're only funded by you.
[01:29:37.832 --> 01:29:39.877]  By getting the products at infootballstore.com.
[01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:45.545]  President Trump calling for a new investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.
[01:29:45.825 --> 01:29:55.191]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary Clinton's leaked emails were likely responsible for the deaths of up to 20 CIA agents working in China.
[01:29:55.291 --> 01:30:00.594]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[01:30:00.994 --> 01:30:10.296]  The FBI is denying that, sort of, but the story is still fluid and confusing, and for some reason a lot of people don't seem interested in finding out what actually happened.
[01:30:10.376 --> 01:30:20.038]  Look, the Deep State doesn't want to do a damage assessment, they don't want to grapple with this, because to do so would undermine the fiction that what Hillary did caused no damage and deserved no prosecution.
[01:30:20.118 --> 01:30:30.360]  The former Secretary of State's carelessness allowed a Chinese state-owned company to gain access to her emails, giving them the ability to read her messages in real time.
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:39.747]  Even worse, the FBI was reportedly warned about this by the intel communities, Inspector General, but did nothing in response.
[01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:45.091]  It's almost like there were, like, folks at the top of the FBI that just weren't interested in anything that made Hillary look bad.
[01:30:45.211 --> 01:30:57.600]  And the fact that this information was discovered, then turned over to the FBI, and the FBI counterintelligence office, including Mr. Peter Strzok, apparently took no interest in it.
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:30:59.100]  It's shocking.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:07.722]  One of the top officials who was alerted to the problem was none other than anti-Trump agent Peter Strzok, who decided to ignore the warning.
[01:31:08.202 --> 01:31:18.845]  Texas Representative Louie Gohmert of the House Judiciary Committee explained that this news would have damaged Clinton's chances in the election, and so agents like Peter Strzok decided to cover it up.
[01:31:19.085 --> 01:31:21.627]  It is time to hold people accountable.
[01:31:22.068 --> 01:31:31.877]  It is time to perform an actual investigation into Hillary's breach of protocol and her facilitating this cyber attack on our country.
[01:31:32.077 --> 01:31:33.579]  What the heck were the Clintons doing?
[01:31:33.839 --> 01:31:36.902]  Why have there been no substantive prosecutions in this case at all?
[01:31:37.062 --> 01:31:39.064]  The reason I think at this point is pretty obvious.
[01:31:39.224 --> 01:31:48.366]  As a result of this massive intelligence leak, China was able to discover the identities and capture some 20 CIA agents who were then either tortured or murdered.
[01:31:48.386 --> 01:32:03.248]  This was a sophisticated intelligence operation in which they were able to generate what is called a courtesy copy of every incoming and outgoing email that Hillary received in her mansion in upstate New York.
[01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:05.929]  I'm told actually in the bathroom of her mansion.
[01:32:06.069 --> 01:32:17.652]  You had dozens of CIA and American sources and operatives in China killed and imprisoned by the Chinese government because they got access to those top secret files.
[01:32:17.672 --> 01:32:24.994]  One agent was actually shot and killed right in front of a Chinese government building in an apparent message designed to intimidate Washington.
[01:32:25.094 --> 01:32:31.616]  It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[01:32:32.256 --> 01:32:33.176]  Because you'd be in jail.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:49.124]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:02.936 --> 01:33:07.640]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:26.462]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:26.502 --> 01:33:27.262]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:27.663 --> 01:33:29.104]  I'm here, Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:29.164 --> 01:33:30.445]  War Room, 3 to 6.
[01:33:31.966 --> 01:33:33.207]  David Knight's in the morning, 8 to 11.
[01:33:33.968 --> 01:33:34.568]  Kickin' butt.
[01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:41.274]  And then we've launched, right through the election, the censored coverage of the 2018 midterms.
[01:33:41.594 --> 01:33:51.102]  The left's violent attacks, their promise for terrorism, their attempts to crash the stock market economy, the trade war with China that they've been launching for decades that we're now just raising a shield to.
[01:33:52.984 --> 01:33:55.126]  Eight o'clock every night, Infowars.com.
[01:33:55.186 --> 01:33:57.127]  We're sending it out on the radio and TV satellites.
[01:33:58.068 --> 01:33:59.849]  For any radio or TV stations that want to pick it up.
[01:34:00.190 --> 01:34:02.311]  And quite a few TV stations are picking it up.
[01:34:02.692 --> 01:34:05.414]  We're only taking the breaks at the top and bottom of the hour.
[01:34:06.175 --> 01:34:08.616]  You guys get those breaks.
[01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:11.459]  We are skipping our breaks for this coverage.
[01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:12.379]  And then we're going to announce
[01:34:13.186 --> 01:34:14.166]  About a week after the election.
[01:34:14.186 --> 01:34:15.967]  We're going to have coverage for about a week after the election.
[01:34:15.987 --> 01:34:17.268]  There will be an aftermath.
[01:34:17.488 --> 01:34:24.552]  We're going to launch a new broadcast from 7 to 10 o'clock every single night here, as we promise to expand towards the new year.
[01:34:25.972 --> 01:34:28.774]  In the face of the globalist attacks, thanks to your prayers and your support.
[01:34:28.814 --> 01:34:31.455]  And don't forget, they're trying to shut us down right now.
[01:34:31.495 --> 01:34:32.916]  So without you, we will be shut down.
[01:34:32.936 --> 01:34:35.977]  I'm going to take phone calls and play clips for the rest of the broadcast here.
[01:34:35.997 --> 01:34:41.120]  I mean, I feel like if I'm not up here yelling and screaming and saying red alert, that I'm actually hurting us.
[01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:44.711]  The internet kills what is in place.
[01:34:44.791 --> 01:34:46.892]  Trump doesn't have control of it, as I said a few weeks ago.
[01:34:47.233 --> 01:34:48.313]  Now they've announced that today.
[01:34:48.614 --> 01:34:49.474]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[01:34:50.055 --> 01:34:51.996]  The censorship has gone thermonuclear.
[01:34:52.536 --> 01:34:55.398]  Every major conservative site you can imagine being banned off Twitter and Facebook.
[01:34:56.119 --> 01:34:59.641]  I mean, they have titrated the dose, they've conditioned us, and now they're making their big move.
[01:34:59.921 --> 01:35:01.242]  That is a military tactic as well.
[01:35:01.763 --> 01:35:06.246]  Where you pinprick attacks, where people don't take them serious anymore, then you hit them with the big one.
[01:35:07.059 --> 01:35:09.960]  And that, again, is a tactic we use in Panama and many other areas.
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:12.021]  And that's what other systems use.
[01:35:12.061 --> 01:35:15.302]  And this is economic and psychological warfare.
[01:35:16.142 --> 01:35:17.583]  And so notice it's not even big news now.
[01:35:18.423 --> 01:35:20.944]  Everybody heard about censorship when they got sick of it about Alex Jones.
[01:35:21.944 --> 01:35:24.345]  And I predicted it wouldn't get a lot of attention when it was everybody else.
[01:35:24.765 --> 01:35:26.626]  I know the enemy game plan.
[01:35:27.966 --> 01:35:29.227]  I know the enemy game plan.
[01:35:31.787 --> 01:35:35.829]  And they've gone from denying censoring to celebrating it and saying, we don't like it, we think,
[01:35:38.052 --> 01:35:40.293]  The Daily Caller's spam.
[01:35:41.154 --> 01:35:43.375]  We think, and then everybody's banned.
[01:35:43.835 --> 01:35:45.076]  We think Michelle Malcolm's spam.
[01:35:45.116 --> 01:35:48.278]  No, she's effective, she's smart, she does a great job.
[01:35:49.458 --> 01:35:50.499]  Even though we had a fight one time.
[01:35:50.519 --> 01:35:53.521]  Because I showed Marines killing a puppy.
[01:35:54.902 --> 01:35:58.263]  And I said, listen, I support the military, but I don't like people killing innocent animals and stuff.
[01:35:58.303 --> 01:35:59.464]  It makes people look bad.
[01:35:59.744 --> 01:36:01.505]  And she said it was a robot dog.
[01:36:02.686 --> 01:36:04.347]  No, it wasn't a robot dog, okay?
[01:36:05.649 --> 01:36:10.271]  And so, some of her handlers bumped into me with their elbows, so I bumped into them a lot harder, too.
[01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:24.378]  And, uh, I was like some 6'5 guy, but he wasn't tough, and he hit me with his elbows, so I rammed him in his elbow and felt something crack, and he was like, whoa, and I was like, uh, yeah, dude, you hit me, I'm gonna actually hit you back hard, but it's shit.
[01:36:24.418 --> 01:36:29.120]  So, but she's been banned off Facebook, and it's all happening right now.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:33.322]  Thousands of people, thousands of prominent groups, some of these pages with millions of followers.
[01:36:34.283 --> 01:36:34.583]  It's here.
[01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.130]  So how do we respond to that?
[01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:37.811]  What do we do?
[01:36:37.831 --> 01:36:39.511]  Do you agree with me they're coming over the top?
[01:36:39.611 --> 01:36:40.752]  I mean, this is the big push.
[01:36:41.112 --> 01:36:44.693]  I see an exponential buildup where I don't see how they turn it up after the election.
[01:36:45.213 --> 01:36:48.514]  They know in the internal polls and even public ones now that there's a red wave.
[01:36:49.555 --> 01:36:56.657]  And they couldn't stop the second SCOTUS appointment.
[01:36:58.398 --> 01:36:58.718]  And so
[01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:07.615]  The calls for violence, the open borders, the Islamification, the demonization, the race war garbage, it's all gone into hyperdrive.
[01:37:08.075 --> 01:37:09.656]  So what do we do to counter this?
[01:37:10.337 --> 01:37:11.958]  What do we do to expose what's happening?
[01:37:11.978 --> 01:37:18.902]  What stunts do we pull that are legal and lawful in the media, like we did saying Bill Clinton's a rapist, that helped defeat Hillary?
[01:37:19.262 --> 01:37:21.143]  We have to get out in the streets.
[01:37:21.984 --> 01:37:25.586]  We have to get aggressive politically.
[01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:27.047]  Economically.
[01:37:28.376 --> 01:37:30.017]  I mean, look, they're getting aggressive.
[01:37:30.037 --> 01:37:32.239]  $38 million, twice what Ted Cruz has raised.
[01:37:32.899 --> 01:37:35.842]  The most ever in three months for a Senate candidate for veto.
[01:37:37.523 --> 01:37:40.645]  An idiot, moron, anti-gun, slimebag.
[01:37:41.706 --> 01:37:43.447]  And it's just every news channel in Texas.
[01:37:43.507 --> 01:37:46.389]  Worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship.
[01:37:50.052 --> 01:37:50.673]  On and on and on.
[01:37:53.375 --> 01:37:55.196]  So, that's what's happening.
[01:37:57.389 --> 01:37:57.909]  And it's bad.
[01:37:58.750 --> 01:37:59.671]  And it's Soros money.
[01:37:59.951 --> 01:38:00.832]  And it's Globalist money.
[01:38:01.472 --> 01:38:02.353]  And they're making their move.
[01:38:04.114 --> 01:38:06.016]  Now look, you guys have been supporting us.
[01:38:06.036 --> 01:38:08.518]  I'm going to give the number out.
[01:38:10.799 --> 01:38:14.082]  First-time callers are people that have called in before but were unable to get on air.
[01:38:15.563 --> 01:38:16.224]  When you sat on hold.
[01:38:17.144 --> 01:38:18.325]  That counts as a first-time caller.
[01:38:19.186 --> 01:38:20.227]  We just have a big phone system.
[01:38:20.267 --> 01:38:22.308]  It can take tons of calls at the same time.
[01:38:22.328 --> 01:38:25.211]  So that's why, sometimes we don't get to your calls, but I'm going to try here to get to everybody.
[01:38:28.217 --> 01:38:36.884]  I don't have words to describe how coordinated and evil this is, and how outrageous it is, and I'm so ashamed that we're on the knife edge of retaining the House and the Senate.
[01:38:38.186 --> 01:38:46.493]  The House particularly, because people can't choose America and our recovery and goodness over the Chicoms and Hollywood and all this scum.
[01:38:47.834 --> 01:38:53.639]  But that's how many people they've brainwashed and wrecked and ruined, and who like to get into the hate.
[01:38:54.901 --> 01:39:03.787]  Of calling Trump an evil white supremacist who was looking at Kanye and looking at Mr. Brown and thinking racist thoughts.
[01:39:03.887 --> 01:39:06.228]  That's what Cuomo said, Chris Cuomo.
[01:39:07.909 --> 01:39:13.733]  And all the things they said, I don't want to repeat it, but they called him a dumb, ignorant Negro.
[01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:18.872]  Which is like the n-word now in parlance.
[01:39:18.912 --> 01:39:19.772]  It's not a racist word.
[01:39:19.792 --> 01:39:21.913]  It's like Anglo, Negro.
[01:39:23.074 --> 01:39:25.416]  Negro means black in Spanish or Latin.
[01:39:26.556 --> 01:39:27.857]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:39:30.039 --> 01:39:34.462]  They're up there invoking serious racism and saying he's like a minstrel show.
[01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:36.583]  And that he's a white supremacist puppet.
[01:39:39.165 --> 01:39:40.165]  I already played it last hour.
[01:39:40.445 --> 01:39:41.886]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:39:41.906 --> 01:39:44.348]  These are nasty people using the race card.
[01:39:45.615 --> 01:39:53.037]  And they sit up there with a big consensus of experts who are all just Democratic Party hacks reading a script and just parroting, parroting, parroting.
[01:39:53.558 --> 01:40:06.342]  And you've got 28% in most polls up from 13% of black folks in this country saying they now support President Trump.
[01:40:06.382 --> 01:40:09.463]  And you know a lot of folks, black or white, are scared to say they support Trump in a poll.
[01:40:10.851 --> 01:40:11.712]  And even how they sample it.
[01:40:11.752 --> 01:40:15.995]  So I'd say that number's at like 45, 50, and that's why the globalists are crapping their britches.
[01:40:16.376 --> 01:40:24.402]  You know, I've been down at the Travis County Courthouse this week, and we had a real blessing, and I'm just going to leave it at that, and just thank God for all your prayers, and I appreciate everybody out there.
[01:40:24.823 --> 01:40:30.968]  Some very positive things have gone on for my family and for justice.
[01:40:31.668 --> 01:40:32.469]  And I'll leave it at that.
[01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:34.611]  Some sad things, but things that had to be done.
[01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:42.851]  I mean, I just couldn't get the black people and Hispanics to stop shaking my hand.
[01:40:43.311 --> 01:40:46.172]  I mean, white folks like me too, but let me tell you, the black folks love me.
[01:40:46.612 --> 01:40:47.893]  Hispanic folks love me, and I love them.
[01:40:48.533 --> 01:40:54.955]  And I'm walking down the street just shaking hands, black folks in suits, black guys in repair uniforms, Hispanic folks, families.
[01:40:55.715 --> 01:40:58.516]  I got that little cafeteria down there with all the little Hispanic ladies in it.
[01:40:58.956 --> 01:40:59.776]  They're just all sweethearts.
[01:40:59.796 --> 01:41:00.357]  They all know who I am.
[01:41:00.377 --> 01:41:00.977]  They all like me.
[01:41:01.017 --> 01:41:01.697]  They all know.
[01:41:01.897 --> 01:41:02.777]  They're not stupid.
[01:41:03.418 --> 01:41:04.398]  They can tell I walk in there.
[01:41:04.438 --> 01:41:05.058]  I'm a nice guy.
[01:41:05.078 --> 01:41:07.279]  They're probably... People know I'm not a villain.
[01:41:08.803 --> 01:41:10.424]  So all the propaganda hadn't worked.
[01:41:10.644 --> 01:41:13.105]  So I've just got to be taken completely off the air, don't I?
[01:41:14.345 --> 01:41:16.026]  And I'm not saying I'm perfect.
[01:41:17.647 --> 01:41:18.227]  I like women.
[01:41:18.247 --> 01:41:21.828]  I like how God made me.
[01:41:21.848 --> 01:41:27.531]  I like enchiladas and cold beer too, and I probably drink too much of that and eat too much of it.
[01:41:27.831 --> 01:41:30.372]  But the point is, is I love life.
[01:41:30.872 --> 01:41:31.652]  And I love justice.
[01:41:31.692 --> 01:41:33.153]  And I love seeing your success.
[01:41:33.993 --> 01:41:34.773]  And I believe in you.
[01:41:34.793 --> 01:41:36.654]  So we're going to give the number out.
[01:41:36.794 --> 01:41:37.314]  We come back.
[01:41:37.355 --> 01:41:38.075]  We're going to take calls.
[01:41:39.178 --> 01:41:41.038]  We got some really special stuff in the fourth hour today.
[01:41:41.058 --> 01:41:47.000]  Can you believe Hillary is going to run for president and they're going to give her the nomination, it's confirmed.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:51.161]  The CIA, the people that aren't leftists are totally blown away.
[01:41:51.181 --> 01:41:52.601]  They've been at the planning meetings.
[01:41:52.641 --> 01:41:54.002]  This is being planned.
[01:41:54.602 --> 01:41:57.923]  And Michelle Obama is going to be VP.
[01:41:57.963 --> 01:41:58.523]  That's the ticket.
[01:41:59.103 --> 01:42:01.244]  So you heard it here first, next year's news today.
[01:42:02.804 --> 01:42:05.985]  Maybe putting it out there, it's thought might stop it, but who knows.
[01:42:08.581 --> 01:42:10.853]  And they want me off the air because these predictions aren't predictions.
[01:42:10.994 --> 01:42:12.200]  The things are set up.
[01:42:15.157 --> 01:42:15.677]  At that level.
[01:42:15.737 --> 01:42:17.358]  And Trump is the insurgency against that.
[01:42:17.678 --> 01:42:18.599]  We are the resistance.
[01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:21.220]  Don't forget, I've got the biggest sale we've ever done.
[01:42:21.481 --> 01:42:22.881]  Without your funding, we won't be here.
[01:42:23.182 --> 01:42:25.063]  Free shipping store-wide on everything.
[01:42:25.403 --> 01:42:26.904]  And 50% off on all the supplements.
[01:42:26.944 --> 01:42:27.484]  It's Christmas.
[01:42:28.084 --> 01:42:28.925]  It's Black Friday.
[01:42:28.985 --> 01:42:29.765]  It's Cyber Monday.
[01:42:29.965 --> 01:42:31.126]  All rolled into one.
[01:42:31.146 --> 01:42:32.707]  So everything must go.
[01:42:32.867 --> 01:42:33.787]  Everything must sell.
[01:42:34.108 --> 01:42:36.449]  Because we may not even have the ability to take orders soon.
[01:42:36.469 --> 01:42:37.369]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:42:37.690 --> 01:42:38.670]  You've seen it all over the news.
[01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:39.731]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:42:41.293 --> 01:42:47.617]  There are a lot of people out there on television, radio, and on the internet, and print, telling you that they've got the answers.
[01:42:47.657 --> 01:42:48.738]  They know how the world really works.
[01:42:49.559 --> 01:42:52.080]  The funny thing is, nobody tries to shut them down.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.922]  Nobody tries to keep them quiet.
[01:42:53.942 --> 01:43:00.787]  Because they're like a bunch of brainwashed, lobotomized monkeys running around, not knowing what they're really doing.
[01:43:01.967 --> 01:43:09.313]  But in full wars, now Hillary Clinton and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the EU and the CHICOMS, they want us shut down.
[01:43:10.282 --> 01:43:15.006]  Because you see, I actually read the Chinese Communist Establishment Party newspapers.
[01:43:15.326 --> 01:43:19.210]  I actually read the Council on Foreign Relations bimonthly publication, Foreign Affairs.
[01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:28.078]  I've actually read hundreds and hundreds of books written by people like David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski, so I know their larger game plan.
[01:43:28.958 --> 01:43:31.421]  I know the operation they're carrying out against humanity.
[01:43:31.841 --> 01:43:34.083]  And so, because I have their number, they want me shut down.
[01:43:34.844 --> 01:43:35.844]  You've seen massive
[01:43:36.565 --> 01:43:38.546]  Corporate demonization and lies about us.
[01:43:38.606 --> 01:43:44.510]  You've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away so we can't even process orders.
[01:43:45.231 --> 01:43:50.014]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel mafia operation.
[01:43:50.074 --> 01:43:55.137]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[01:43:56.818 --> 01:44:10.145]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[01:44:10.745 --> 01:44:14.947]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[01:44:16.067 --> 01:44:21.550]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globalists coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:22.911]  Black Friday's coming early.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:24.981]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[01:44:25.121 --> 01:44:29.465]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed, starting now.
[01:44:30.025 --> 01:44:35.430]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:43.776]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[01:44:44.657 --> 01:44:46.799]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:44:47.975 --> 01:44:57.959]  InfoWars has always been in our hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[01:44:58.399 --> 01:45:03.101]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[01:45:03.602 --> 01:45:06.763]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[01:45:07.403 --> 01:45:12.365]  And so now they're coming after our ability at InfoWarsTore.com to even have credit card processing.
[01:45:12.385 --> 01:45:15.627]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[01:45:16.647 --> 01:45:17.348]  Get your X2.
[01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:20.833]  Even though it's selling out in the last run, 50% off.
[01:45:21.193 --> 01:45:23.076]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[01:45:23.436 --> 01:45:24.898]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[01:45:25.599 --> 01:45:27.241]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[01:45:27.281 --> 01:45:29.625]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[01:45:29.965 --> 01:45:33.330]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[01:45:34.611 --> 01:45:37.853]  Free shipping, store-wide, at fullmoresstore.com.
[01:45:38.013 --> 01:45:40.135]  This is Christmas in October.
[01:45:40.635 --> 01:45:48.200]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great, the five-star ratings, and go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts so that you have them.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.621]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[01:45:49.641 --> 01:45:50.822]  Christmas is only two months away.
[01:45:51.622 --> 01:45:54.204]  And you can support the Infowar while getting great products and win-win.
[01:45:54.504 --> 01:45:55.305]  I'm counting on you.
[01:45:55.345 --> 01:45:56.286]  You've always come through.
[01:45:56.306 --> 01:46:06.573]  They know you always come through, which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability with a five-star rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[01:46:06.754 --> 01:46:09.676]  They want to shut down because we're successful and we expose them.
[01:46:09.836 --> 01:46:13.779]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.

[01:46:20.878 --> 01:46:22.720]  You've been successful by supporting us.

[01:46:31.991 --> 01:46:32.912]  You always come through.
[01:46:33.232 --> 01:46:34.013]  Take advantage of this.
[01:46:34.033 --> 01:46:36.176]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[01:46:44.525 --> 01:46:47.266]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:52.668 --> 01:46:57.210]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.791]  Watch me!
[01:46:57.911 --> 01:46:58.471]  Watch me!
[01:46:58.711 --> 01:46:59.591]  Too hard not to do that.
[01:46:59.751 --> 01:47:00.352]  Watch me!
[01:47:00.592 --> 01:47:01.292]  I got something.
[01:47:01.772 --> 01:47:02.273]  I got it.
[01:47:03.573 --> 01:47:04.213]  Watch me!
[01:47:04.934 --> 01:47:05.474]  Trump's got it.
[01:47:07.597 --> 01:47:08.398]  Mr. Brown's got it.
[01:47:09.258 --> 01:47:10.139]  Mr. West has got it.
[01:47:10.799 --> 01:47:11.819]  And you got it, folks.
[01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:17.643]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:17.703 --> 01:47:18.443]  I got soul.
[01:47:19.144 --> 01:47:20.324]  And I'm super bad.
[01:47:21.345 --> 01:47:22.926]  Not bad in a bad way, bad in a good way.
[01:47:23.426 --> 01:47:27.168]  Let's listen to Mr. Brown a little bit more.
[01:47:27.909 --> 01:47:28.749]  Feels so good.
[01:47:28.769 --> 01:47:29.990]  Tells me what to do.
[01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:49.256]  And I'm super bad!
[01:47:51.538 --> 01:47:52.639]  Now, let's get serious here.
[01:47:52.659 --> 01:48:04.088]  The toll-free number to join us on... Do you think I'm exaggerating how deadly dangerous the times are and that things are so critical at this point, I should be on air 24 hours a day?
[01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:08.332]  And we all just have the normalcy of living in a quasi-free country.
[01:48:09.012 --> 01:48:14.516]  We have real authoritarians in a real power grab.
[01:48:15.316 --> 01:48:17.738]  America is in the greatest danger it's ever been in.
[01:48:17.758 --> 01:48:23.781]  Because King George III was an angel compared to the elites we have today.
[01:48:23.841 --> 01:48:27.223]  He was a wonderful person compared to them.
[01:48:28.324 --> 01:48:29.585]  Some could say even honorable.
[01:48:31.746 --> 01:48:32.707]  Just tyrannical.
[01:48:34.448 --> 01:48:35.608]  But not a bad person.
[01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:39.130]  I've read several history books from different perspectives.
[01:48:40.911 --> 01:48:42.231]  Mentally ill, yes, from inbreeding.
[01:48:43.151 --> 01:48:45.272]  But believed he was doing good things.
[01:48:46.153 --> 01:48:46.693]  Had courage.
[01:48:49.594 --> 01:48:58.557]  People running things in this country are the worst synthesis of decades of scum promoting themselves up and only the very worst getting positions of power.
[01:48:58.938 --> 01:49:00.518]  It's a marathon of evil.
[01:49:01.238 --> 01:49:02.419]  A survival of the worst.
[01:49:04.266 --> 01:49:05.047]  Of the most twisted.
[01:49:07.068 --> 01:49:08.369]  And I don't say that to scare you.
[01:49:08.409 --> 01:49:12.452]  See, you know, the Globalist years ago said, oh, we don't care if Jones is on air, he's just scaring them for us.
[01:49:12.792 --> 01:49:14.213]  No, you think we're like you.
[01:49:15.914 --> 01:49:17.235]  I believed in people.
[01:49:18.135 --> 01:49:20.097]  And that if they knew the threat, they'd want to do something about it.
[01:49:22.679 --> 01:49:23.479]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:30.204]  If I saw thugs breaking into my neighbor's house, I'd call the police.
[01:49:30.904 --> 01:49:31.665]  But if I saw them
[01:49:33.123 --> 01:49:34.444]  Say pistol whipping my neighbor.
[01:49:34.624 --> 01:49:45.868]  I would get excited, not because I'm a violent person, but then at that point I have an instinct that I would enjoy going into gear and grabbing a firearm and taking action.
[01:49:48.630 --> 01:49:51.531]  Just like I enjoy that I got a boil on my foot lancing it.
[01:49:51.971 --> 01:49:54.952]  It hurts, pus comes out, but your body says that's good.
[01:49:54.972 --> 01:49:56.353]  That's what you're supposed to be doing.
[01:49:59.127 --> 01:49:59.767]  It's the same thing.
[01:49:59.867 --> 01:50:01.868]  This is what you're born for, folks.
[01:50:02.648 --> 01:50:04.328]  This is what it's all about right now.
[01:50:05.288 --> 01:50:08.809]  We're facing real evil, and I'm going to say it for the 10th time today.
[01:50:09.509 --> 01:50:11.270]  Everybody kept saying, how's it going, man?
[01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:12.290]  You must be really down.
[01:50:13.610 --> 01:50:14.611]  What's it like?
[01:50:14.631 --> 01:50:15.791]  They're going to destroy you.
[01:50:15.811 --> 01:50:17.591]  They're going to try to destroy your operation.
[01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:18.651]  They're going to try to bankrupt you.
[01:50:18.692 --> 01:50:20.372]  And I'm like, get ready.
[01:50:20.392 --> 01:50:21.112]  They're coming for you.
[01:50:21.432 --> 01:50:21.692]  Come on.
[01:50:21.772 --> 01:50:22.132]  Let's go.
[01:50:22.152 --> 01:50:22.532]  Let's get them.
[01:50:22.592 --> 01:50:24.013]  I mean, it's not me.
[01:50:24.273 --> 01:50:25.173]  You're under attack.
[01:50:27.096 --> 01:50:28.957]  You're stealing your birthright, people!
[01:50:31.218 --> 01:50:32.539]  I'm more alive than I've ever been!
[01:50:32.619 --> 01:50:33.499]  I'm in a war!
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:35.660]  Wake up!
[01:50:36.461 --> 01:50:37.221]  You're in one!
[01:50:41.883 --> 01:50:44.805]  With child-molesting scum...
[01:50:47.856 --> 01:51:00.544]  Psychopaths that see you as food on the table, as stakes, who are into being evil, who are allied with the Chinese Communists, and I'll say it again, who've killed five times in their own admissions what Hitler did.
[01:51:00.564 --> 01:51:06.267]  Now I'm going to ask you again.
[01:51:07.228 --> 01:51:10.350]  Why in the world would everyone not be behind Trump?
[01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:13.952]  And why would everyone in the world not be behind restoring our Republic?
[01:51:14.272 --> 01:51:15.573]  What is your problem?
[01:51:17.679 --> 01:51:19.620]  And our audience is like, no, we're awake, we're involved.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:20.880]  No, I'm not talking to you.
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:21.980]  Thank God you're awake.
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:23.221]  Thank God you're the reason we're here.
[01:51:23.241 --> 01:51:24.621]  I'm not talking to you.
[01:51:24.701 --> 01:51:25.801]  You know what I'm saying.
[01:51:25.842 --> 01:51:27.902]  Well, we got to go tell the sheep out there.
[01:51:29.363 --> 01:51:31.083]  Listen, bro, you're with the wolves.
[01:51:31.103 --> 01:51:32.303]  They're eating your butt.
[01:51:32.343 --> 01:51:33.124]  They're not good.
[01:51:33.144 --> 01:51:35.624]  They're not even wearing sheep's clothing.
[01:51:37.705 --> 01:51:39.326]  And they're coming for everybody.
[01:51:39.346 --> 01:51:41.186]  They're trying to sew it all up right now.
[01:51:41.246 --> 01:51:42.387]  The doors are closing.
[01:51:42.967 --> 01:51:44.127]  The knives are coming out.
[01:51:45.207 --> 01:51:46.868]  They're butchering people all around you.
[01:51:49.872 --> 01:51:50.652]  They're uncloaked!
[01:51:51.433 --> 01:51:52.433]  They're firing on you!
[01:51:53.834 --> 01:52:04.739]  But see, a lot of people think, along with the establishment, mainstream media, whatever is in Vogue magazine, whatever is on ABC News, they still think that if they parrot that, they're like in the majority and cool.
[01:52:04.759 --> 01:52:05.519]  They're followers!
[01:52:05.879 --> 01:52:06.499]  Okay, great!
[01:52:06.559 --> 01:52:07.340]  You want to be followers?
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:07.800]  That's great!
[01:52:09.497 --> 01:52:19.891]  You're like sheep marching into a banquet, and a bunch of wolves are sitting around a big table, and you see sheep hanging up by their feet, gutted, and wolves gobbling the fresh meat, and you say, what's for dinner?
[01:52:19.911 --> 01:52:23.356]  And they're like, you don't know, you don't smell the blood and guts, you dumb idiot!
[01:52:23.777 --> 01:52:24.938]  We're gonna eat your ass!
[01:52:29.230 --> 01:52:35.332]  Instead, you are lined up with the wolves, saying, protect us from those sheepdogs we saw back there in the field.
[01:52:35.592 --> 01:52:40.294]  They were trying to tell us not to go this direction, but we didn't listen to them and we came down here.
[01:52:42.214 --> 01:52:44.855]  And the wolves are like, well, thank you, you're a really good person.
[01:52:45.195 --> 01:52:45.635]  Come on in here.
[01:52:47.996 --> 01:52:49.296]  So here's the toll-free number to join us.
[01:52:49.316 --> 01:52:49.797]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:52:49.817 --> 01:52:49.877]  877-789-2539.
[01:52:49.897 --> 01:52:50.817]  What do we do to stop this?
[01:52:50.837 --> 01:52:51.077]  I just...
[01:52:58.922 --> 01:52:59.723]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:52:59.823 --> 01:53:00.183]  It's bad.
[01:53:00.884 --> 01:53:02.245]  The good news is we're on air, we're fighting it.
[01:53:02.265 --> 01:53:05.287]  But my God, this is all un-American tyranny taking place.
[01:53:05.367 --> 01:53:06.208]  It's naked now.
[01:53:06.428 --> 01:53:08.149]  There's no holding back now.
[01:53:08.249 --> 01:53:08.770]  It's real.
[01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:11.212]  They're preparing mass bombings like I told you.
[01:53:11.232 --> 01:53:12.473]  I even said they'll bomb D.C.
[01:53:13.253 --> 01:53:16.996]  before the election and now they bust a guy with 200 pounds who's a crazy Democrat.
[01:53:18.858 --> 01:53:20.019]  I'm gonna go to some clips here.
[01:53:22.103 --> 01:53:23.624]  And, you know, here's the breaking news.
[01:53:23.924 --> 01:53:26.205]  Senator Cotton, we have a clip coming up next hour.
[01:53:26.505 --> 01:53:30.246]  The Schumer political operation was behind the release of Dr. Ford's letter from the very beginning.
[01:53:30.266 --> 01:53:30.767]  We knew that.
[01:53:31.487 --> 01:53:35.429]  Rand Paul, media cover-ups, police shootings, shouting, this is for health care.
[01:53:36.589 --> 01:53:38.770]  Because they hadn't given them their free health care.
[01:53:42.311 --> 01:53:43.272]  And then all the rest of it.
[01:53:43.292 --> 01:53:46.113]  I've got all this Islamic news that is just unbelievable.
[01:53:47.045 --> 01:53:50.328]  Poland and Austria to quit UN migration compact.
[01:53:50.848 --> 01:53:52.649]  We want Poles to be safe in our own country.
[01:53:52.910 --> 01:54:01.657]  He goes on to say they're joining Hungary, the United States, and others in not having the UN run who can come into your country.
[01:54:01.877 --> 01:54:07.481]  Yeah, until last year, going back to Bill Clinton, the UN was over who came to the US.
[01:54:08.102 --> 01:54:08.962]  And guess who runs that?
[01:54:10.223 --> 01:54:12.505]  You guessed it, a board appointed by George Soros.
[01:54:18.365 --> 01:54:18.925]  There's another one.
[01:54:18.965 --> 01:54:19.266]  Greece.
[01:54:19.626 --> 01:54:28.632]  Large Christian cross pulled down because it could offend to Muslim migrants on the island of Lesbos that's had thousands, hundreds of thousands of Islamists' land.
[01:54:28.892 --> 01:54:31.073]  They didn't like it, so they're pulling it down all over Europe.
[01:54:31.274 --> 01:54:34.776]  They're removing it from churches and public places saying it's racist.
[01:54:35.777 --> 01:54:39.579]  And the EU is appointing all Muslim boards to have it all removed.
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:41.680]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:42.441]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:54:42.721 --> 01:54:43.762]  Cannot make that up.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:49.903]  Marks and Spencer criticized for selling school uniform hijabs for toddlers.
[01:54:50.204 --> 01:54:55.448]  They're now telling even kids at public schools and private schools that have any Muslims going there, cover your girls.
[01:54:55.848 --> 01:54:56.069]  See?
[01:54:56.609 --> 01:54:57.150]  Surreal law.
[01:54:58.150 --> 01:54:59.512]  Oh, you don't want to offend the Muslims.
[01:55:01.301 --> 01:55:05.663]  SJW has won that Dwayne The Rock Johnson is not black enough to play John Henry.
[01:55:06.043 --> 01:55:07.303]  That's just some of the type of stuff.
[01:55:07.323 --> 01:55:11.925]  And then tomorrow, internet across the globe to face downtime over the next 48 hours.
[01:55:12.105 --> 01:55:13.366]  ICANN's having problems.
[01:55:13.686 --> 01:55:15.106]  They're testing the internet kill switch.
[01:55:15.367 --> 01:55:18.328]  Obama transferred most of the control of the internet to the UN.
[01:55:20.014 --> 01:55:25.037]  And the EU and a board run by... George Soros!
[01:55:25.557 --> 01:55:36.944]  When he did it three years ago, Soros said in leaked documents that came out, it was in the news, that they would ban all conservative and nationalist news to stop the collapse of the world government, calling it fake news and hate.
[01:55:37.464 --> 01:55:38.105]  And here we are!
[01:55:38.125 --> 01:55:39.245]  They're still doing it!
[01:55:39.465 --> 01:55:40.706]  And what's the president gonna do?
[01:55:41.006 --> 01:55:43.428]  He's surrounded by a bunch of cowards that won't stop this!
[01:55:45.885 --> 01:55:49.847]  The Pentagon shouldn't be meeting with Google next week about their treason.
[01:55:50.067 --> 01:55:52.328]  They should be taking it over.
[01:55:53.028 --> 01:55:56.550]  It's our company, our infrastructure, we paid for it, and they merged with the Chinese.
[01:55:56.770 --> 01:55:58.111]  It's a national security threat.
[01:55:58.471 --> 01:55:59.672]  This isn't radical statements.
[01:56:00.212 --> 01:56:02.433]  We are basically gone if we don't do that.
[01:56:03.273 --> 01:56:12.638]  Tim Cook should be absolutely indicted for treason and espionage, giving all the code keys to China and letting them put spy chips at Foxconn into all the damn phones.
[01:56:14.713 --> 01:56:16.274]  Are you worried Tim Cook banned you?
[01:56:16.954 --> 01:56:17.554]  I'm worried?
[01:56:17.695 --> 01:56:18.455]  He's a traitor!
[01:56:18.755 --> 01:56:19.996]  I don't care what they do to me!
[01:56:20.296 --> 01:56:21.476]  I'm gonna go down with the ship!
[01:56:21.737 --> 01:56:22.837]  I'm not a frickin' traitor!
[01:56:23.517 --> 01:56:25.098]  I'm not Benedict Arnold, baby!
[01:56:27.119 --> 01:56:28.520]  It was some big giant free country.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:29.360]  I'd marry it.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:30.281]  I'd merge with it.
[01:56:31.341 --> 01:56:31.722]  It ain't!
[01:56:33.763 --> 01:56:35.764]  I think America should merge with Switzerland today.
[01:56:37.124 --> 01:56:37.484]  China?
[01:56:37.685 --> 01:56:37.885]  No.
[01:56:39.566 --> 01:56:39.866]  Get it?
[01:56:41.607 --> 01:56:43.087]  I'm loyal to freedom.
[01:56:43.247 --> 01:56:44.268]  And I'm loyal to free will.
[01:56:45.728 --> 01:56:46.388]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:46.408 --> 01:56:47.829]  I've got all these clips and I'm going right to your calls.
[01:56:47.849 --> 01:56:48.830]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[01:56:48.850 --> 01:56:50.671]  877-789-2539.
[01:56:50.711 --> 01:56:51.432]  How do we stop this?
[01:56:51.792 --> 01:56:52.512]  How critical is this?
[01:56:52.532 --> 01:56:53.433]  Do you feel the energy?
[01:56:53.453 --> 01:56:54.333]  Do you feel the critical?
[01:56:54.353 --> 01:56:55.574]  Do you feel the time is short?
[01:56:55.774 --> 01:57:01.278]  Do you feel how we're down to the wire here and the enemy's throwing everything they got.
[01:57:01.298 --> 01:57:02.498]  They're getting ready for massive violence.
[01:57:02.558 --> 01:57:09.703]  And you understand if you don't fund us and get the t-shirts and the books and the videos and the supplements, free shipping, 50% off, biggest sale ever.
[01:57:09.763 --> 01:57:14.226]  Have to get everything out there to fund the operation in case they try to shut us down, which they're already trying to do.
[01:57:15.146 --> 01:57:17.648]  You've come a long way, baby, to get where you got to today.
[01:57:17.688 --> 01:57:20.230]  You've got your own cigarette now, baby.
[01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:50.292]  Drew's only been here about four or five months, and he's behind the camera right now.
[01:57:50.572 --> 01:57:56.474]  And I've just done this big pitch for our new product for women that is the best products, the best ingredients we can come up with.
[01:57:57.075 --> 01:57:58.635]  And he said, man, you need to reshoot this.
[01:57:59.336 --> 01:58:00.856]  Literally 20 seconds ago, and I said, what?
[01:58:01.877 --> 01:58:03.518]  He goes, what's that Virginia Slims at?
[01:58:04.698 --> 01:58:08.480]  And I went, oh, the one about empowering women smoking cigarettes and killing themselves.
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:10.941]  He goes, yeah, you've come a long way, baby.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:15.101]  And that just totally hit me like a ton of bricks.
[01:58:15.841 --> 01:58:25.165]  So hundreds of millions of women died of lung cancer because the whole feminist movement from the 20s and the 40s was funded by the cigarette makers to get women to smoke.
[01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:30.767]  And they continue that line into the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s saying, you've come a long way.
[01:58:31.227 --> 01:58:32.928]  You can smoke Virginia Slims.
[01:58:33.348 --> 01:58:34.709]  You too can die of lung cancer.
[01:58:35.329 --> 01:58:44.137]  So, Stephen Colbert and all these programs demonized me for promoting known herbs, known vitamins, known trace minerals that are so critical to women.
[01:58:44.337 --> 01:58:46.039]  My god, iodine is absolutely king.
[01:58:46.439 --> 01:58:47.140]  The good allergen.
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:52.564]  And then I'm the bad guy all over the news for promoting healthy formulas, but they are promoting
[01:58:53.505 --> 01:58:54.085]  Pure poison.
[01:58:54.146 --> 01:58:54.946]  So, hey.
[01:58:55.726 --> 01:58:56.927]  Yeah, women, you've come a long way.
[01:58:56.987 --> 01:58:58.028]  The families are broken up.
[01:58:58.068 --> 01:58:59.209]  Society's falling apart.
[01:58:59.449 --> 01:59:03.251]  Hundreds of millions of women, including one of my grandmothers, have died of lung cancer from cigarettes.
[01:59:03.271 --> 01:59:05.693]  But I'm saying we've all come a long way.
[01:59:05.753 --> 01:59:07.273]  Men and women as humans together.
[01:59:07.354 --> 01:59:08.434]  Black, white, old, young.
[01:59:09.035 --> 01:59:11.736]  Realizing that if you don't get vitamin C, you die of scurvy.
[01:59:11.776 --> 01:59:14.058]  If you don't have vitamin B12, you get cancer.
[01:59:14.318 --> 01:59:15.118]  It's that simple.
[01:59:15.238 --> 01:59:17.540]  And products like this new one we've developed
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.701]  Ultimate female force.
[01:59:20.101 --> 01:59:22.842]  This will do a lot better for you than Virginia Slims, believe me.
[01:59:23.382 --> 01:59:27.924]  So, yeah, you've come a long way, baby, with Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:33.007 --> 01:59:38.909]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:50.166 --> 01:59:56.149]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:02.832 --> 02:00:05.593]  Oh, you don't hear about fusing GPS anymore.
[02:00:06.394 --> 02:00:13.557]  Cooked up by Jeb Bush, and then handed over to Hillary, and then more garbage dumped on top of it.
[02:00:14.317 --> 02:00:15.218]  BuzzFeed putting it out.
[02:00:16.852 --> 02:00:18.115]  Trump with women urinating on him.
[02:00:18.355 --> 02:00:19.998]  Absolute hogwash.
[02:00:21.542 --> 02:00:23.005]  Absolute balderdash.
[02:00:23.626 --> 02:00:27.755]  Complete and total fiction of the defamatory type.
[02:00:29.355 --> 02:00:31.576]  That's okay, because they were doing it to a white supremacist.
[02:00:31.676 --> 02:00:32.617]  Oh, that's not true either.
[02:00:33.157 --> 02:00:34.658]  But now Kanye's a white supremacist.
[02:00:35.098 --> 02:00:36.179]  Calls are coming up next segment.
[02:00:36.799 --> 02:00:39.000]  But here's the latest breaking news alert.
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:44.343]  The head of Fusion GPS has taken the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
[02:00:44.703 --> 02:00:46.784]  Here is that important news.
[02:00:50.206 --> 02:00:50.926]  Capitol Hill.
[02:00:51.327 --> 02:00:53.468]  Can lawmakers force him to answer questions?
[02:00:53.868 --> 02:00:57.530]  We're going to get insight from a veteran of the Watergate investigation.
[02:01:02.246 --> 02:01:04.368]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:04.428 --> 02:01:07.150]  They are now running for the hills.
[02:01:07.651 --> 02:01:11.033]  And gotta leave PM there in case you need that as well.
[02:01:11.053 --> 02:01:12.394]  I was making a joke.
[02:01:12.454 --> 02:01:13.715]  Aleve is our new sponsor.
[02:01:13.735 --> 02:01:14.696]  The left will put articles out.
[02:01:14.756 --> 02:01:15.637]  Stop them immediately.
[02:01:15.877 --> 02:01:17.639]  Oh my god, you're funding white supremacists.
[02:01:18.219 --> 02:01:20.301]  Just think about how criminal the media is.
[02:01:21.422 --> 02:01:22.983]  Think about how out of control they are.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:25.840]  The so-called media.
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:26.441]  They're not media.
[02:01:26.461 --> 02:01:28.202]  They're psychological terrorists.
[02:01:28.922 --> 02:01:30.583]  They are liars, and they know they're liars.
[02:01:31.223 --> 02:01:35.185]  And then all they try to do is get more and more radical, lie more and more because the old lies didn't work.
[02:01:35.585 --> 02:01:36.626]  Here, let's just make it worse.
[02:01:36.666 --> 02:01:37.606]  Let's make it more intense.
[02:01:37.646 --> 02:01:39.087]  Let's make it more out of control.
[02:01:39.107 --> 02:01:47.891]  I want to play a clip here of Jim Brown that was
[02:01:49.403 --> 02:01:50.924]  I can be very blunt about taking a knee.
[02:01:50.944 --> 02:01:51.824]  See, first of all, I'm an American.
[02:02:18.686 --> 02:02:20.127]  That flag is my flag.
[02:02:20.147 --> 02:02:25.188]  The things that I've overcome in this country allow us to make me a better person.
[02:02:26.769 --> 02:02:33.291]  I don't think that we should take knees in protest instead of standing up for our flag.
[02:02:34.552 --> 02:02:36.853]  I think we should work out our problems as a family.
[02:02:38.053 --> 02:02:43.575]  And that's what I would advocate to my children, to all the young people that I deal with.
[02:02:44.576 --> 02:02:45.476]  I am an American.
[02:02:46.336 --> 02:02:47.717]  That flag is my flag.
[02:02:49.002 --> 02:02:51.984]  And I want to represent it that way.
[02:02:56.286 --> 02:02:57.847]  Well, you'd have to talk to Conway.
[02:02:58.027 --> 02:03:02.810]  I mean, he's a beautiful human being, but I can't speak for anyone.
[02:03:03.211 --> 02:03:05.012]  Two more questions.
[02:03:05.172 --> 02:03:07.893]  Two more questions, huh?
[02:03:07.993 --> 02:03:09.114]  I don't get shot.
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:16.341]  We're going to move on.
[02:03:16.421 --> 02:03:16.781]  Thank you.
[02:03:16.861 --> 02:03:17.161]  All right.
[02:03:17.201 --> 02:03:17.622]  Last question.
[02:03:17.642 --> 02:03:17.902]  Excuse me.
[02:03:17.922 --> 02:03:18.322]  Last question.
[02:03:18.342 --> 02:03:19.443]  Mr. Brown, I have a follow-up question.
[02:03:19.463 --> 02:03:25.186]  What's been the reaction from members of the football community to your support for this administration's president?
[02:03:27.147 --> 02:03:28.227]  Oh, really?
[02:03:29.988 --> 02:03:30.508]  I don't know.
[02:03:30.528 --> 02:03:33.510]  I really don't.
[02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:35.491]  I don't really care.
[02:03:38.432 --> 02:03:41.014]  Because this is the president of the United States.
[02:03:42.915 --> 02:03:48.617]  He allowed me to be invited to his territory.
[02:03:50.777 --> 02:03:53.818]  He treated us beautifully.
[02:03:55.378 --> 02:03:56.479]  And he shared some thoughts.
[02:03:58.339 --> 02:04:01.840]  And he will be open to talking when I get back to him.
[02:04:03.161 --> 02:04:04.561]  That's the best he could do for me.
[02:04:06.127 --> 02:04:09.588]  So I'm happy to say on that it's been very successful.
[02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:11.429]  I want to give you all my respect.
[02:04:11.449 --> 02:04:12.009]  We got to go.
[02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:13.070]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:13.930]  Thank you.
[02:04:15.171 --> 02:04:16.031]  That's a classy guy.
[02:04:16.051 --> 02:04:17.392]  They don't make it like that anymore, do they?
[02:04:17.912 --> 02:04:19.092]  No, they don't.
[02:04:20.673 --> 02:04:21.533]  He respects himself.
[02:04:21.573 --> 02:04:22.474]  He respects the president.
[02:04:22.514 --> 02:04:24.195]  And he cares about the black community.
[02:04:24.515 --> 02:04:26.275]  And it's absolutely behind the scenes.
[02:04:26.796 --> 02:04:30.017]  Gotten tens of thousands of youth out of trouble and created tens of thousands of jobs.
[02:04:30.257 --> 02:04:31.798]  And now he's helping President Trump.
[02:04:32.619 --> 02:04:36.855]  Energize the black community with real investment and real jobs and a real future.
[02:04:41.363 --> 02:04:47.368]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:04:47.749 --> 02:04:50.351]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:04:50.971 --> 02:04:54.394]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:04:54.675 --> 02:04:58.938]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:04:59.379 --> 02:05:02.621]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:03.522 --> 02:05:13.765]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:14.525 --> 02:05:23.068]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:05:24.708 --> 02:05:33.230]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:47.554]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:05:47.874 --> 02:05:53.015]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:22.659 --> 02:06:24.859]  Well, I missed Zach's call last night.
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:29.280]  I get to the point where I just got to turn my cell phone off.
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:31.081]  But, you know, I know Zach.
[02:06:31.101 --> 02:06:31.901]  I know who Zach is.
[02:06:31.941 --> 02:06:37.302]  I know he's friends with Kanye West and friends with a lot of other folks like Elon Musk.
[02:06:37.322 --> 02:06:40.743]  And he was also friends with Anthony Bourdain.
[02:06:41.703 --> 02:06:43.843]  And he's a really interesting fella.
[02:06:44.324 --> 02:06:46.804]  And I can't, he doesn't want to get into who he is at this point.
[02:06:47.704 --> 02:06:50.525]  And his history and his background was very, very interesting.
[02:06:51.565 --> 02:06:52.305]  And complex.
[02:06:53.646 --> 02:06:58.027]  And, of course, Kanye's come out and said Alex Jones and Donald Trump are the ultimate Matrix Breakers.
[02:06:58.667 --> 02:07:04.869]  But everybody that goes against the grain, when the grain is evil, is a Matrix Breaker.
[02:07:06.029 --> 02:07:10.711]  And this is a very magic time to be alive right now, where humanity's at a crossroads.
[02:07:10.731 --> 02:07:20.434]  But I noticed, I gave the number out, and Zach, who wouldn't come on the last three, four months, because of Homeland Security harassing him and his family,
[02:07:21.792 --> 02:07:23.932]  And again, Trump isn't in full control of Homeland Security.
[02:07:23.972 --> 02:07:29.494]  I know a lot of that got shut down now, but because of the security clearances and things he's had, they really came after him.
[02:07:29.514 --> 02:07:34.695]  He didn't give anything secret out on the show, but they sure came after him.
[02:07:35.615 --> 02:07:39.096]  And of course, he's good friends with Louis Farrakhan and a bunch of other people.
[02:07:39.156 --> 02:07:40.076]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:07:40.476 --> 02:07:41.216]  So he's connected.
[02:07:42.496 --> 02:07:44.517]  And a lot of stuff's been going on to him and his family.
[02:07:44.557 --> 02:07:46.357]  He knows a lot of things about Libya and things.
[02:07:48.274 --> 02:07:49.415]  Just again, leave it at that.
[02:07:50.036 --> 02:07:51.797]  But I'm glad he's the first caller to call in.
[02:07:51.817 --> 02:07:55.640]  Then we'll go to Kevin and A-Boss and Robert and everybody else.
[02:07:56.101 --> 02:07:57.702]  And Zach, I get you on as a guest.
[02:07:58.302 --> 02:08:01.625]  I looked up and noticed you've been sitting there for 14 minutes, so I appreciate you holding.
[02:08:01.645 --> 02:08:04.067]  And I know a lot of wild stuff's going on.
[02:08:04.087 --> 02:08:07.790]  I mean, you told me you'll soon see Kanye at the White House.
[02:08:08.931 --> 02:08:10.473]  You said that the culture will speak.
[02:08:11.113 --> 02:08:12.555]  And you've not predicted.
[02:08:12.575 --> 02:08:16.058]  You know a lot of what's coming and what's going to be unfolding.
[02:08:16.859 --> 02:08:30.233]  And so 25 days out, my friend, from this historic crossroads election, you want to connect the dots with Nikki Haley, Michelle Obama, a vent and more.
[02:08:30.293 --> 02:08:31.074]  So thanks for coming on.
[02:08:33.086 --> 02:08:35.006]  First and foremost, it's a pleasure to be back on.
[02:08:35.046 --> 02:08:36.447]  I apologize for my absence.
[02:08:36.607 --> 02:08:38.127]  Obviously, a lot of things were going on.
[02:08:38.147 --> 02:08:41.208]  It's a very complex country and a very complex situation.
[02:08:41.228 --> 02:08:54.510]  But yes, like we predicted last year, and you know, YouTube has done a very good job of wiping what we said last year off.
[02:08:55.150 --> 02:08:59.291]  But on your broadcast, I said, in resignation, in that order,
[02:08:59.881 --> 02:09:01.102]  Dannon will be gone.
[02:09:01.482 --> 02:09:02.703]  Haley will be gone.
[02:09:03.124 --> 02:09:04.505]  Tillerson will be gone.
[02:09:04.925 --> 02:09:05.766]  Sessions is next.
[02:09:06.386 --> 02:09:07.167]  Watch my words.
[02:09:07.707 --> 02:09:10.209]  And I have some information about Haley.
[02:09:10.689 --> 02:09:12.151]  I have some information about this.
[02:09:12.751 --> 02:09:14.192]  But make no mistake.
[02:09:16.114 --> 02:09:18.936]  I was dealing with some personal things, so I had to deal with it.
[02:09:18.976 --> 02:09:21.538]  But now I'm in a much better place now.
[02:09:21.698 --> 02:09:23.800]  And let's just say this.
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:25.921]  A very big event is being planned.
[02:09:26.962 --> 02:09:28.103]  And there's going to be some speakers.
[02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:30.571]  Alex Jones is going to be a speaker.
[02:09:31.671 --> 02:09:33.112]  Roseanne Barr is going to be a speaker.
[02:09:34.052 --> 02:09:35.613]  Louis Farrakhan is going to be a speaker.
[02:09:36.574 --> 02:09:37.954]  Kanye West is going to be a speaker.
[02:09:38.715 --> 02:09:39.655]  And I can guarantee that.
[02:09:40.836 --> 02:09:42.777]  Well, now you're letting the cat out of the bag, man.
[02:09:43.437 --> 02:09:44.257]  Oh, listen.
[02:09:44.457 --> 02:09:45.418]  I know, I know.
[02:09:45.438 --> 02:09:45.818]  Hey, I know.
[02:09:46.038 --> 02:09:50.260]  They try to stop Kanye this time, because obviously he was coming here to the office and then they went crazy.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:51.601]  I'll go ahead and release all this.
[02:09:52.501 --> 02:09:53.742]  Why are you releasing all this right now?
[02:09:54.704 --> 02:09:55.505]  Because it has to happen.
[02:09:55.525 --> 02:09:58.166]  By the way, I was about to say, why didn't you just call Daria or the producers?
[02:09:58.427 --> 02:09:59.367]  We'd have put you on Skype.
[02:09:59.527 --> 02:10:00.068]  Better audio.
[02:10:00.108 --> 02:10:01.649]  I mean, you could have called here if you wanted to come on.
[02:10:02.309 --> 02:10:02.749]  I know.
[02:10:02.769 --> 02:10:05.892]  A lot of things are happening, and this is what's going to occur.
[02:10:06.272 --> 02:10:07.132]  This is what's going to occur.
[02:10:07.873 --> 02:10:10.295]  If we want to do the reveal right now, I'll do the reveal right now.
[02:10:10.915 --> 02:10:12.176]  Is that the best thing, Zach?
[02:10:12.196 --> 02:10:13.497]  Because usually you hold back.
[02:10:13.537 --> 02:10:14.978]  Maybe we shouldn't do the reveal.
[02:10:15.358 --> 02:10:17.079]  Let's hold up until we talk today, okay?
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:18.020]  Okay.
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:19.521]  We'll do the reveal right there.
[02:10:19.981 --> 02:10:20.221]  Okay.
[02:10:20.341 --> 02:10:21.462]  But just make no mistake, folks.
[02:10:22.843 --> 02:10:24.064]  Like we said last year,
[02:10:24.901 --> 02:10:25.941]  Or earlier this year, rather.
[02:10:26.302 --> 02:10:27.282]  Culture will speak.
[02:10:27.822 --> 02:10:38.326]  And notice that Kanye used the term Chiraq, and maybe a lot of these listeners don't understand what that means, but that's about culture, that's about mingos, that's about rap.
[02:10:38.607 --> 02:10:41.028]  Culture will speak, and culture did speak.
[02:10:41.868 --> 02:10:46.910]  And there was a lot of things behind the scenes that were occurring at the White House that I was very proud to see.
[02:10:47.557 --> 02:10:53.740]  That I had a lot to do with, that a lot of people I knew had a lot to do with, and we're very proud of it, we're very happy about it.
[02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:56.902]  What we're not happy about is the attack on Elon Musk.
[02:10:57.122 --> 02:10:59.423]  What we're not happy about is the attack on Alex Jones.
[02:11:00.023 --> 02:11:01.684]  It's an absolute disgrace in this country.
[02:11:02.064 --> 02:11:14.411]  It will be addressed, and quite frankly, what it might be... Well, I was told separately, I was told separately by the CIA and the Pentagon, in person and over the phone, that Trump, he said, don't worry, they're gonna pay.
[02:11:15.851 --> 02:11:17.632]  Well, there's no real worry.
[02:11:17.652 --> 02:11:24.158]  I think what it's doing is exposing sort of an error in the system of corporatism.
[02:11:24.518 --> 02:11:29.202]  An error in the system of economic advertising.
[02:11:29.362 --> 02:11:31.303]  Meaning, we can make our own revenue.
[02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:33.105]  We can generate our own bandwidth.
[02:11:33.325 --> 02:11:34.566]  We can have our own reach.
[02:11:34.646 --> 02:11:35.727]  We don't need them.
[02:11:35.767 --> 02:11:38.929]  No, I agree, but let's get to Nikki Haley, because that's what's really important.
[02:11:39.550 --> 02:11:41.892]  I was told, not just by you, but by others, that she's the mole.
[02:11:42.552 --> 02:11:46.635]  And the Trump letter going a nice way, and you did say that last year first.
[02:11:47.035 --> 02:11:48.276]  I got the clip, Dave.
[02:11:48.296 --> 02:11:51.038]  Listen, I got it on the hard drive.
[02:11:51.478 --> 02:11:52.399]  I told you, Haley.
[02:11:52.579 --> 02:11:53.920]  I told you about Haley last year.
[02:11:54.701 --> 02:11:56.142]  She's a snake in the grass.
[02:11:56.162 --> 02:11:57.382]  She's a UN creature.
[02:11:57.843 --> 02:11:59.064]  And it's not going to be Hillary.
[02:11:59.104 --> 02:12:00.945]  Hillary will be there in essence.
[02:12:00.985 --> 02:12:01.966]  She'll be there to promote.
[02:12:02.086 --> 02:12:03.066]  She'll be on the podium.
[02:12:03.086 --> 02:12:08.190]  But it's going to be Michelle O.P., Nikki Haley running as vice.
[02:12:08.812 --> 02:12:09.312]  And that's
[02:12:29.786 --> 02:12:39.009]  High-level folks that have been in the meetings, unless they're putting out disinfo to fool the guys that are in the meetings, they're saying Hillary won't step down, refuses to, and that Michelle O is going to be VP.
[02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:41.490]  No.
[02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:44.931]  They won't let her do it because of what's been revealed about Bernie.
[02:12:45.511 --> 02:12:54.394]  What's been revealed about Bernie, and I implore individuals, first of all, I've had some conversations out there in the hills, out there in Calabasas,
[02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:57.074]  With Joe Rogan, about having you back on.
[02:12:57.134 --> 02:13:02.155]  But when he had Roseanne Barr on, and I implore people to listen to that, a lot of things were revealed.
[02:13:02.735 --> 02:13:12.818]  And what was done to Bernie Sanders, the true DNC members, who happen to be actual Democrats, who happen to be progressives, like they're actually progressives.
[02:13:12.858 --> 02:13:13.798]  They actually believe it.
[02:13:14.219 --> 02:13:16.139]  They're not happy about what occurred.
[02:13:17.359 --> 02:13:19.360]  He publicly won the nomination and they stole it.
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:22.841]  Publicly won it and they're not going to let her do a damn thing.
[02:13:23.482 --> 02:13:25.302]  And here's the big point.
[02:13:25.743 --> 02:13:28.123]  Oh my God, we could talk for hours, but here's the big point.
[02:13:28.663 --> 02:13:29.303]  Here's the big point.
[02:13:29.944 --> 02:13:37.525]  We have Kanye and Jim Brown, two of the most iconic African American individuals in the Oval Office, talking to the President of the United States of America.
[02:13:37.885 --> 02:13:38.645]  Here's my question.
[02:13:39.606 --> 02:13:41.246]  Where's the response from Barack Hussein?
[02:13:42.106 --> 02:13:42.606]  Where are you at?
[02:13:47.052 --> 02:13:47.913]  We know where you're at.
[02:13:47.973 --> 02:13:51.654]  Can you believe they're calling Kanye all these racist names?
[02:13:51.774 --> 02:13:54.415]  A minstrel, a dumb negro.
[02:13:54.435 --> 02:13:55.555]  I mean, I'm just outraged.
[02:13:55.595 --> 02:13:59.957]  It's sick to watch real racism and saying, oh, that's a dumb black man.
[02:13:59.977 --> 02:14:00.737]  He doesn't know anything.
[02:14:00.777 --> 02:14:01.597]  He's mentally ill.
[02:14:02.057 --> 02:14:02.758]  This is crazy.
[02:14:03.398 --> 02:14:11.761]  It's smarter because the Q community and this whole phenomenon, this whole problem, which is a farce and it got really ran out of control.
[02:14:11.781 --> 02:14:11.841]  But
[02:14:13.328 --> 02:14:16.610]  They were calling for tribunals early and this and this and this.
[02:14:16.971 --> 02:14:19.512]  You can't do that that early because it causes chaos.
[02:14:19.552 --> 02:14:20.733]  You need to do it gradually.
[02:14:21.033 --> 02:14:30.660]  And what you're seeing is a gradual dismantling of the Democratic Party and the corrupt nature of the United States government that has been alive since about the 40s.
[02:14:31.601 --> 02:14:33.102]  And it's being done brilliantly.
[02:14:33.502 --> 02:14:40.927]  And what occurred in the Oval Office with Kanye West and Jim Brown was spectacular, was very important, was a critical part.
[02:14:41.707 --> 02:14:51.892]  The event that I'm putting together, the event that will shock the world, the event that will cause headlines for weeks, will also do that.
[02:14:52.512 --> 02:14:58.475]  And the type of stuff that we saw in the Oval Office will continue because the dialogue needs to continue.
[02:14:58.735 --> 02:14:59.736]  We are Americans.
[02:15:00.136 --> 02:15:01.356]  I don't care where you're from.
[02:15:01.656 --> 02:15:03.217]  I don't care what you think happened.
[02:15:03.497 --> 02:15:05.738]  I don't care what... There's never been a better model.
[02:15:06.099 --> 02:15:06.319]  Ever.
[02:15:06.619 --> 02:15:06.959]  Anywhere.
[02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:11.550]  I know I got loaded phone lines, but I'm going to get to everybody.
[02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:14.051]  But do a few more minutes, Zach, because I wish you'd have called in on Skype.
[02:15:14.471 --> 02:15:18.192]  And then we were going to talk it to, briefly, and then I've got a big special report coming up.
[02:15:18.212 --> 02:15:19.033]  Then I'll talk to you after that.
[02:15:20.613 --> 02:15:24.074]  And what he's saying is going on behind the scenes.
[02:15:24.475 --> 02:15:27.075]  And I trust Zach, because he usually holds pretty close to the vest.
[02:15:27.616 --> 02:15:29.576]  So I've got to talk to you during the break, if we can patch him through.
[02:15:29.596 --> 02:15:31.937]  I want to find out why in the world he's saying this on air.
[02:15:32.877 --> 02:15:37.299]  Because in my experience, that's not, well, we're going to find out what's going on.
[02:15:40.362 --> 02:15:42.162]  So now, we got Matt Bracken.
[02:15:42.202 --> 02:15:43.323]  He's a former Navy SEAL.
[02:15:43.563 --> 02:15:47.084]  This is a man who's been in war zone environments.
[02:15:47.124 --> 02:15:48.524]  He can tell you what to do.
[02:15:48.564 --> 02:15:50.725]  So I want to roll this video with just a little bit of audio.
[02:15:50.765 --> 02:15:57.186]  And Matt, if you could just comment over what this guy does right and what he does wrong and what you should do if you're confronted with this situation.
[02:15:57.226 --> 02:15:58.447]  Alright guys, let's roll the video.
[02:15:59.687 --> 02:16:00.187]  Go ahead, Matt.
[02:16:01.441 --> 02:16:05.862]  First, I would never second-guess the guy because it's easy to say, well, don't be there, you know?
[02:16:06.422 --> 02:16:08.743]  See this mob three blocks back and make a U-turn.
[02:16:09.223 --> 02:16:11.064]  But let's just say it starts with where he is.
[02:16:12.404 --> 02:16:13.644]  Stopping to get out of the car?
[02:16:14.265 --> 02:16:14.805]  Don't do it.
[02:16:15.845 --> 02:16:21.647]  That could have been a fatal thing right there because if a big guy body checks the door, you just broke your ankle or shin.
[02:16:22.147 --> 02:16:23.267]  Now you can't even drive.
[02:16:23.887 --> 02:16:25.629]  So right there, that's a big mistake.
[02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:27.290]  But I mean, I'm not going to second-guess.
[02:16:27.330 --> 02:16:28.951]  The guy looks like a brave old stud.
[02:16:29.432 --> 02:16:32.414]  Guy probably turns out to be, you know, a Vietnam-era war hero.
[02:16:33.054 --> 02:16:35.116]  And he just doesn't back down to mobs.
[02:16:35.156 --> 02:16:36.918]  You know, he sees communists, he wants to fight.
[02:16:37.338 --> 02:16:38.219]  I can appreciate that.
[02:16:38.679 --> 02:16:44.784]  But a few tactics that you can use is, first of all, if you have the choice, get a car with a little bit higher suspension.
[02:16:45.224 --> 02:16:52.570]  You know, going from like a 5-inch ground clearance to an 8 or 10-inch ground clearance means you're going to drive over people and not get stuck.
[02:16:53.090 --> 02:16:54.192]  It's gross, but it's true.
[02:16:54.793 --> 02:16:59.720]  And once you get a little bit of clear space ahead of you, if you gun it like he did, this is good.
[02:17:00.622 --> 02:17:03.426]  Gunning it and stopping, gunning it and stopping it, and also weaving.
[02:17:04.122 --> 02:17:11.691]  Uh, making the car go, like, lurching side to side makes people afraid to run right up to the sides because you've just been doing, like, S-turns down the street.
[02:17:12.152 --> 02:17:22.804]  But once you've cleared the zone, you know, you're going to pro- if you've had people thumping on you, get a few blocks away, just like it was a shooting, and you were the good guy, you're gonna- you want to be the first to call 911.
[02:17:24.125 --> 02:17:29.787]  If somebody takes your picture and you assume it's gonna happen, if the police come to your house, it's a hit and run.
[02:17:30.207 --> 02:17:37.709]  If you get three blocks away and you call 911 and describe the scene, just like a good shooting, it puts you way ahead of the game legally.
[02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:41.190]  And then, what you need to do once you're talking to the police?
[02:17:41.630 --> 02:17:43.391]  I was in fear for my life.
[02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:44.411]  What's today?
[02:17:44.571 --> 02:17:45.811]  I was in fear for my life.
[02:17:46.091 --> 02:17:47.232]  You know, what did you have for breakfast?
[02:17:47.372 --> 02:17:48.492]  I was in fear for my life.
[02:17:49.012 --> 02:17:54.394]  You repeat that until you're lawyered up, and then you shut up and let the lawyer talk.
[02:17:54.935 --> 02:17:58.916]  But what you have to stick with, just like a shooting, I was in fear for my life.
[02:17:59.116 --> 02:18:02.018]  Even if you drove over people, you stick with that.
[02:18:02.438 --> 02:18:10.061]  So don't flee the scene, park a few blocks away in safety, call 911, explain the situation, then you're the good guy because you called it in.
[02:18:10.732 --> 02:18:14.055]  And you explained that you were in a life-or-death situation.
[02:18:14.375 --> 02:18:16.457]  They were pounding on your car, breaking windows.
[02:18:16.497 --> 02:18:17.678]  You thought they would kill you.
[02:18:18.299 --> 02:18:19.860]  That's a reasonable assertion.
[02:18:20.701 --> 02:18:26.306]  And in Portland, it might not fly, but it's better than fleeing the scene, then getting arrested as a hit-and-run later.
[02:18:26.326 --> 02:18:27.868]  Because they will have your license.
[02:18:28.843 --> 02:18:31.584]  Yeah, that totally makes sense, everything you said.
[02:18:32.084 --> 02:18:35.245]  And I like the weaving and just going away a few blocks.
[02:18:35.285 --> 02:18:36.245]  And I will make this point.
[02:18:37.205 --> 02:18:41.846]  When this story came out, they said no one had called the cops on either side at that time.
[02:18:42.426 --> 02:18:45.127]  So the news had already figured out that nobody called the cops.
[02:18:45.607 --> 02:18:47.028]  That guy, I totally agree.
[02:18:47.128 --> 02:18:47.748]  Call the cops.
[02:18:47.988 --> 02:18:50.008]  Get it on record that you were the first one to call.
[02:18:50.388 --> 02:18:52.369]  Therefore, you have something at least to fall back on.
[02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:53.110]  I totally agree.
[02:19:10.383 --> 02:19:13.246]  You would be within your rights to drive over those guys.
[02:19:13.646 --> 02:19:16.789]  Because five or six guys in their 20s can put you to the ground.
[02:19:16.989 --> 02:19:20.051]  Once you're on the ground, it's skull stomping time.
[02:19:20.532 --> 02:19:21.873]  And that is a fatal attack.
[02:19:21.993 --> 02:19:24.795]  You're either going to be brain damaged, disfigured, or dead.
[02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:27.618]  So you cannot go to the ground in a mob.
[02:19:27.698 --> 02:19:28.659]  Don't get out of the car.
[02:19:28.779 --> 02:19:29.900]  Use the car for the weapon.
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:32.462]  But then don't do a hit and run and try to get away.
[02:19:32.522 --> 02:19:34.083]  Assume the police will get your license.
[02:19:34.444 --> 02:19:37.006]  So be the first to call 911 and be the good guy.
[02:19:44.039 --> 02:19:46.648]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:13.169 --> 02:20:22.375]  Alright, I got loaded phone lines, and then Zach's a great source of really interesting information, and I know who he is, who's identity he is, and some of the things he's done behind the scenes, and things that have unfolded.
[02:20:23.636 --> 02:20:36.804]  And so he is who he says he is, he does do what he says he's doing, and I can confirm some of the stuff he's been up to out in Las Vegas and out in Florida and out in L.A.
[02:20:36.864 --> 02:20:37.284]  as well.
[02:20:38.225 --> 02:20:41.467]  But just finishing up, I know we're winning, the country's coming back.
[02:20:42.498 --> 02:20:47.180]  This whole Democrat Party is being dismantled because they're a criminal group allied with Chi-Coms.
[02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:49.901]  Now everything we talked about years ago is now all over the news.
[02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:51.242]  The secret chips from China.
[02:20:51.682 --> 02:20:53.663]  Tim Cook, Apple, Google moving over there.
[02:20:53.943 --> 02:20:59.726]  The Pentagon is summoning Google next week to try to read the Riot Act to them.
[02:21:00.186 --> 02:21:03.267]  The fact that they already did this, you can't ever let them back into anything.
[02:21:03.287 --> 02:21:03.848]  They're criminals.
[02:21:04.528 --> 02:21:05.669]  They're censoring Americans.
[02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:11.436]  It isn't 800 conservative sites that were banned off Facebook and Twitter together yesterday.
[02:21:11.697 --> 02:21:17.344]  Now we're learning it's thousands and thousands with tens of millions of followers, total or more.
[02:21:17.604 --> 02:21:18.905]  Some have millions of followers apiece.
[02:21:19.386 --> 02:21:21.469]  They're really making a serious criminal move.
[02:21:22.725 --> 02:21:27.986]  Twenty-five days out, they busted this guy with a 200-pound bomb, who was going to blow stuff up because he's a Democrat.
[02:21:28.666 --> 02:21:33.408]  They've got the editor of Raw Story saying, you know, Scalise deserved it, we're defending ourselves.
[02:21:34.068 --> 02:21:37.669]  You've got the former Attorney General saying, we need to kick them, we need to attack conservatives.
[02:21:38.049 --> 02:21:43.490]  You've got Antifa blocking roads all over the country, trying to get run over, trying to have another Charlottesville.
[02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:47.691]  So, all I'm saying, Zach, is you say big event.
[02:21:49.039 --> 02:21:51.041]  I think they know they're exponentially losing.
[02:21:51.581 --> 02:21:53.383]  I don't think they even want this election to happen.
[02:21:53.963 --> 02:21:59.147]  And they admittedly were going to try to have this bombing and others to suspend the election, and then claim it's Trump's fault.
[02:21:59.508 --> 02:22:10.657]  So just give us, from your perspective and your sources, and some of the people, some of the generals I know that you talk to, that talk to you, that authorize you to come on the show, what are they thinking is going to be pulled?
[02:22:10.697 --> 02:22:18.383]  Because if we don't see there's about to be a big leprous attack... Here's the thing, here's the thing, this is why I haven't been on, this is why the show
[02:22:19.051 --> 02:22:23.335]  Yeah, on your platforms have been canceled because we compiled a timeline.
[02:22:23.736 --> 02:22:24.977]  What happened to Gaddafi?
[02:22:25.297 --> 02:22:26.479]  What happened at Vegas?
[02:22:27.019 --> 02:22:38.130]  What all these things that are unsolved that we cover, that InfoWars covers, with impeccable integrity, with impeccable journalistic integrity, what happened to those things?
[02:22:38.390 --> 02:22:40.833]  Well, they just go unsolved and then the next thing happens.
[02:22:40.913 --> 02:22:41.774]  The next thing happens.
[02:22:42.194 --> 02:22:42.915]  Let me tell you something.
[02:22:43.683 --> 02:22:53.435]  You're not going to stop us now, because we have enough capital now, we have enough integrity now, we have a president in the White House now, that's not going to allow us to be stopped.
[02:22:54.025 --> 02:22:56.106]  Free market will thrive in this country.
[02:22:56.407 --> 02:22:58.068]  We do not need your platforms.
[02:22:58.368 --> 02:23:00.249]  If you want to de-platform us, great.
[02:23:00.489 --> 02:23:01.410]  We'll make our own platforms.
[02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:06.113]  No, I agree, but what do you make of them now not even calling it fake news, just not even claiming they did violations?
[02:23:06.133 --> 02:23:07.193]  With me, they claim violations.
[02:23:07.454 --> 02:23:16.900]  They just go, thousands of major newspapers and magazines and Michelle Malkin, everybody else, you're just totally banned with millions of followers apiece because we say you're spam.
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:18.100]  We don't like your politics.
[02:23:18.701 --> 02:23:19.421]  Oh, good.
[02:23:19.541 --> 02:23:20.722]  I got some keywords for them.
[02:23:20.902 --> 02:23:22.263]  I got some keywords for them real quick.
[02:23:23.454 --> 02:23:25.876]  What's up with Huma Abedin and Lindsey Graham?
[02:23:26.156 --> 02:23:26.897]  Look at that footage.
[02:23:27.298 --> 02:23:27.618]  Oops.
[02:23:29.099 --> 02:23:30.100]  People forgot about that.
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:31.221]  Go ahead and Google that.
[02:23:31.262 --> 02:23:32.283]  Now people are Googling that.
[02:23:32.423 --> 02:23:32.683]  Good.
[02:23:33.284 --> 02:23:34.925]  You do not want me back on the platform.
[02:23:35.125 --> 02:23:35.686]  I'm telling you.
[02:23:36.066 --> 02:23:37.568]  These people are not playing with us.
[02:23:38.257 --> 02:23:40.158]  They're not playing with us, and we're not playing with them.
[02:23:40.258 --> 02:23:43.259]  We are in a full-out war, and we're going to win the war.
[02:23:43.279 --> 02:23:49.641]  I agree, but doesn't it show how desperate they are, Zach, that they were planning to still do this incrementally over the next few years?
[02:23:49.661 --> 02:23:50.902]  They're desperate, but they're weak.
[02:23:51.462 --> 02:23:52.582]  I know, I listen.
[02:23:52.682 --> 02:23:55.483]  Sometimes my little nephew gets desperate, but I'm like, calm down, buddy.
[02:23:55.863 --> 02:23:56.404]  Calm down.
[02:23:57.784 --> 02:23:58.324]  Calm down.
[02:23:59.505 --> 02:24:01.565]  They're desperate, but they're weak.
[02:24:01.846 --> 02:24:02.906]  They will not win.
[02:24:03.504 --> 02:24:07.266]  We will prevail, culture will speak, and you will not stop us.
[02:24:07.947 --> 02:24:12.550]  And what we have to say... Well, I think they figured that out now, Zach.
[02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:15.372]  I think they figured that out now, but they're not going to give up.
[02:24:15.452 --> 02:24:19.434]  So, at a certain point, I believe in our free market, and I believe in due process.
[02:24:19.775 --> 02:24:23.157]  They're an outside group with CHICOM funding attacking us.
[02:24:23.797 --> 02:24:29.601]  At a certain point, we're in dereliction of duty if we don't tell the President it's time to just deal with these people.
[02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.910]  The President knows.
[02:24:30.970 --> 02:24:32.171]  The President knows.
[02:24:32.431 --> 02:24:33.911]  We're behind the scenes at SimCom.
[02:24:33.951 --> 02:24:34.892]  We know what's going on.
[02:24:36.752 --> 02:24:37.092]  Listen.
[02:24:37.532 --> 02:24:38.313]  There's channels.
[02:24:38.533 --> 02:24:39.493]  There's communication.
[02:24:39.513 --> 02:24:40.694]  It's strategic.
[02:24:40.894 --> 02:24:42.014]  It's happening slowly.
[02:24:42.194 --> 02:24:43.114]  It seems weird.
[02:24:43.374 --> 02:24:44.755]  And it's unfair right now.
[02:24:44.855 --> 02:24:45.835]  It is unfair right now.
[02:24:45.855 --> 02:24:46.836]  But make no mistake.
[02:24:46.936 --> 02:24:48.716]  In the end, we will prevail.
[02:24:49.016 --> 02:24:52.057]  And at the very end of the day, we're going to create even more capital.
[02:24:52.417 --> 02:24:55.659]  So if they want to try to hold something over our head, good luck.
[02:24:55.839 --> 02:24:57.079]  Because you're not going to do nothing.
[02:24:57.179 --> 02:24:59.020]  You're not holding nothing over our head.
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:24:59.700]  Nothing.
[02:25:00.995 --> 02:25:06.059]  Haven't they figured out yet that, like a game of chicken, we're not blinking and that they don't make it out of this?
[02:25:06.139 --> 02:25:09.201]  I mean, there's no scenario where the Globalists win now.
[02:25:09.421 --> 02:25:10.421]  I mean, they're done.
[02:25:11.022 --> 02:25:11.282]  Exactly.
[02:25:11.322 --> 02:25:22.189]  And I'm gonna admit, we have other callers and a show to do here, but what we also have, and I have to just drop this in, we might have to, like, schedule another appearance for me and I'll do the whole thing, but...
[02:25:23.662 --> 02:25:35.750]  I'm talking about Space Force and continuing to talk about Space Force, but what people aren't talking about, because it gets buried by like just like political sort of counterculture, pop culture stuff.
[02:25:36.691 --> 02:25:38.192]  What happened over the skies of China?
[02:25:39.472 --> 02:25:41.814]  Oh yeah, put up that incredible image.
[02:25:41.854 --> 02:25:46.037]  You have a hypersonic nuclear weapon, which is pre-orbit.
[02:25:46.517 --> 02:25:47.237]  Oh, no big deal.
[02:25:47.538 --> 02:25:48.838]  No big deal.
[02:25:48.878 --> 02:25:49.779]  There's no space war.
[02:25:49.799 --> 02:25:50.880]  No big deal.
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:52.681]  Are you guys out of your mind?
[02:25:53.376 --> 02:25:56.078]  You're more worried about Kanye wearing the hat, which is great.
[02:25:56.199 --> 02:25:58.040]  Which, culturally, we're going to do it.
[02:25:58.100 --> 02:25:59.241]  We're going to make things happen.
[02:25:59.401 --> 02:26:00.963]  And that's how we have to do things on the ground.
[02:26:01.303 --> 02:26:02.424]  But make no mistake.
[02:26:03.085 --> 02:26:06.668]  Within the continuity of government, there's actual things occurring.
[02:26:07.088 --> 02:26:07.449]  Period.
[02:26:08.049 --> 02:26:09.631]  Technologically, things are occurring.
[02:26:09.951 --> 02:26:18.118]  And they want to demonize Elon Musk and bury him and bury the DAO and do all this stuff because he talks his mind, speaks his mind.
[02:26:18.218 --> 02:26:18.899]  He's a genius.
[02:26:19.582 --> 02:26:20.762]  Stop hating on people.
[02:26:20.882 --> 02:26:25.804]  Well, I mean, he was exposing the AI gods and the globalist takeover plan, so he had to be punished.
[02:26:25.844 --> 02:26:27.784]  Listen, when I'm off the air, Zach, I'll call you right away.
[02:26:27.824 --> 02:26:28.284]  God bless.
[02:26:28.304 --> 02:26:29.565]  We appreciate you coming on.
[02:26:29.585 --> 02:26:34.366]  But, yeah, get into what that was that went off last night.
[02:26:34.886 --> 02:26:44.048]  I've seen the famous footage in Trinity and beyond, where they're detonating atomic weapons in the atmosphere, and that... Not good.
[02:26:44.648 --> 02:26:45.049]  Not good.
[02:26:45.549 --> 02:26:46.209]  Pretty morbid, too.
[02:26:47.361 --> 02:26:50.642]  Call me when the show's over.
[02:26:51.122 --> 02:26:51.642]  We'll talk.
[02:26:52.882 --> 02:26:53.883]  I promise an appearance.
[02:26:54.083 --> 02:26:54.603]  And you know what?
[02:26:54.623 --> 02:26:56.003]  We'll do the full reveal.
[02:26:56.423 --> 02:26:58.424]  Because at this point, who cares?
[02:26:58.724 --> 02:26:59.144]  I'm all in.
[02:26:59.664 --> 02:27:00.064]  I'm all in.
[02:27:00.084 --> 02:27:00.684]  Well, God bless you.
[02:27:00.724 --> 02:27:01.565]  I'll call you after the show.
[02:27:02.045 --> 02:27:02.405]  Thank you, Shaq.
[02:27:02.425 --> 02:27:03.325]  We're gonna go to calls now.
[02:27:03.485 --> 02:27:04.965]  That happens sometimes when somebody calls in.
[02:27:05.005 --> 02:27:05.846]  I promise I'll get to everybody.
[02:27:05.866 --> 02:27:06.446]  I apologize.
[02:27:06.926 --> 02:27:12.567]  But what exactly is this mysterious light that's spotted in the high skies of China?
[02:27:12.587 --> 02:27:13.548]  Go ahead and scroll down now.
[02:27:14.088 --> 02:27:14.868]  And if you look at
[02:27:16.243 --> 02:27:19.006]  Detonations in space of atomic or nuclear weapons.
[02:27:20.227 --> 02:27:29.235]  That is exactly what they look like in US military air force footage of nuclear weapons detonating in space.
[02:27:31.558 --> 02:27:31.858]  So.
[02:27:35.581 --> 02:27:37.163]  And then, of course, you've got whatever they blew up.
[02:27:39.659 --> 02:27:41.180]  The debris of it sinking down.
[02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:46.541]  But that is a very sophisticated, very sophisticated weapon.
[02:27:48.342 --> 02:27:52.943]  Because, well, you can see the initial detonation point.
[02:27:52.983 --> 02:27:56.064]  It's some type of chain reaction weapon.
[02:27:56.765 --> 02:27:59.966]  Probably, that looks almost like an antimatter pellet or something.
[02:28:01.886 --> 02:28:03.967]  Man, I tell you, they got some, this is wild.
[02:28:05.922 --> 02:28:07.722]  Sure, the Chinese are happy right now.
[02:28:08.383 --> 02:28:11.723]  All right, we're gonna go to break and I promise I won't wrap back to your calls.
[02:28:12.203 --> 02:28:16.704]  Don't forget, we are not in Kansas anymore and InfoWars needs your support.
[02:28:16.764 --> 02:28:24.006]  Plus, we've got supplements of the best out there and we have free shipping store-wide and 50% off all the supplements.
[02:28:24.326 --> 02:28:25.906]  T-shirts, books, videos are all there.
[02:28:26.406 --> 02:28:28.947]  Big discounts across the board and sign up for auto-ship, additional 10% off.
[02:28:30.342 --> 02:28:31.922]  That makes a lot of these lost leaders.
[02:28:31.982 --> 02:28:35.403]  But the enemy's trying to shut us down, so I'm selling everything out of the warehouse.
[02:28:35.864 --> 02:28:37.084]  So we got a backup provision.
[02:28:37.284 --> 02:28:38.044]  Thanks for the support.
[02:28:40.905 --> 02:28:44.366]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:28:44.866 --> 02:28:47.627]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:28:48.147 --> 02:28:53.969]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:28:54.409 --> 02:28:57.190]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:28:57.930 --> 02:29:01.375]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:29:01.735 --> 02:29:07.824]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:29:08.224 --> 02:29:13.191]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:29:13.925 --> 02:29:17.348]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:29:17.868 --> 02:29:24.394]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:29:25.054 --> 02:29:29.738]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:29:30.279 --> 02:29:35.383]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:29:35.983 --> 02:29:39.947]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:29:41.098 --> 02:29:44.099]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force!
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:44.620]  Go ahead.
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:50.483]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[02:29:50.663 --> 02:29:51.763]  I'd done the War Room.
[02:29:52.063 --> 02:29:54.504]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[02:29:54.544 --> 02:29:56.085]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[02:29:56.125 --> 02:29:56.766]  I was exhausted.
[02:29:57.086 --> 02:30:00.347]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[02:30:00.687 --> 02:30:05.330]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[02:30:05.410 --> 02:30:07.431]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[02:30:07.591 --> 02:30:08.131]  Uh, the same thing.
[02:30:08.151 --> 02:30:10.233]  I'm going to put in a full day here at Infowars.
[02:30:10.353 --> 02:30:11.574]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[02:30:11.714 --> 02:30:13.835]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[02:30:13.855 --> 02:30:19.860]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:20.921]  You can sleep with it.
[02:30:21.301 --> 02:30:25.604]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[02:30:25.664 --> 02:30:28.467]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[02:30:28.607 --> 02:30:30.328]  This is the best combination I have found.
[02:30:30.428 --> 02:30:31.129]  It really works.
[02:30:31.369 --> 02:30:35.952]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found, and I've tried them all.
[02:30:36.333 --> 02:30:37.974]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods,
[02:30:38.114 --> 02:30:38.534]  Believe me.
[02:30:40.636 --> 02:30:44.099]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:47.362]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:30:47.883 --> 02:30:53.708]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:30:54.148 --> 02:30:56.930]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:30:57.671 --> 02:31:01.114]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:31:01.474 --> 02:31:07.559]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:31:07.959 --> 02:31:12.924]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:31:13.672 --> 02:31:17.076]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:31:17.596 --> 02:31:24.144]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:31:24.804 --> 02:31:29.410]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:31:30.050 --> 02:31:35.111]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:31:35.691 --> 02:31:39.672]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:31:40.292 --> 02:31:43.173]  Western Europe has already banned free speech.
[02:31:43.373 --> 02:31:47.554]  And an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:31:47.934 --> 02:31:55.416]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:31:55.856 --> 02:31:58.937]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:31:59.577 --> 02:32:03.841]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:32:04.222 --> 02:32:08.146]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:32:08.346 --> 02:32:11.069]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:32:11.509 --> 02:32:15.813]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:32:16.274 --> 02:32:19.297]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:32:19.717 --> 02:32:34.548]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:32:34.808 --> 02:32:36.089]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:32:36.329 --> 02:32:38.790]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:32:45.055 --> 02:32:47.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:57.529 --> 02:33:01.230]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:03.791]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:04.111 --> 02:33:07.292]  All right, let me just say this again because I couldn't say it enough.
[02:33:07.312 --> 02:33:18.975]  Thank you, audience, for being in the arena and being a radio TV audience that's actually changing the world with your support of what we do, but also what you do word of mouth and your courage to stand up for what's right.
[02:33:19.035 --> 02:33:19.776]  You're amazing.
[02:33:20.096 --> 02:33:21.496]  Don't thank me when we take these calls.
[02:33:21.736 --> 02:33:22.596]  You are amazing.
[02:33:23.097 --> 02:33:24.177]  You are incredible.
[02:33:25.831 --> 02:33:29.392]  Love will tell you all day what crap you are, how racist you are, to demoralize you.
[02:33:29.452 --> 02:33:33.594]  I'm telling you, you're awesome because you are, and we're changing the world, and it's real, and it's happening.
[02:33:37.496 --> 02:33:39.856]  And I'm very thankful for all your prayers.
[02:33:40.517 --> 02:33:45.799]  Real prayer has been answered on so many fronts here, and we're still in
[02:33:47.506 --> 02:33:48.106]  The woods here.
[02:33:48.707 --> 02:33:54.451]  But I can see the opening to the beautiful field out there where all of our children are going.
[02:33:54.951 --> 02:33:57.913]  We may not make it out to that field, but our kids are going to go there.
[02:33:57.953 --> 02:33:59.114]  And that's really what matters.
[02:33:59.694 --> 02:34:03.377]  And that's what this is really all about, is that commitment to something bigger.
[02:34:03.637 --> 02:34:07.520]  And we're individuals, but there is a collective in God's greater plan.
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:10.582]  And I'm just very thankful to all of you.
[02:34:10.602 --> 02:34:11.582]  Please keep praying for us.
[02:34:12.503 --> 02:34:14.304]  Because I just want to execute better.
[02:34:14.344 --> 02:34:15.325]  Man, I'm up here a lot.
[02:34:15.365 --> 02:34:16.146]  I'm covering a lot.
[02:34:17.006 --> 02:34:22.188]  And I just get mad at myself because there's so much I don't get to, and then I'm always mad at myself, truthfully.
[02:34:22.848 --> 02:34:25.649]  That kind of spills over to the crew, in that they're doing a great job.
[02:34:25.669 --> 02:34:26.950]  I just, this is so epic.
[02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:30.011]  How do you... How do you fight this?
[02:34:30.051 --> 02:34:34.313]  What do you come... What words do you come up with to what these people do?
[02:34:34.553 --> 02:34:36.334]  Because they're indescribably evil.
[02:34:38.774 --> 02:34:42.436]  And we're handicapped in this because we're not...
[02:34:44.093 --> 02:34:44.513]  Like that!
[02:34:44.573 --> 02:34:47.796]  You know, we would be depressed if we cheated on our wife or husband.
[02:34:48.397 --> 02:34:52.280]  Or if we did something corrupt, or we said something mean to somebody that didn't deserve it.
[02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:53.381]  We have a conscience.
[02:34:54.021 --> 02:34:55.342]  They don't have any conscience.
[02:34:56.123 --> 02:34:57.965]  They have no governor, they have no bottom.
[02:34:59.686 --> 02:35:00.427]  There's no basement.
[02:35:01.988 --> 02:35:09.794]  To quote Lee Stranahan, the left isn't the left, they're... They are the left-hand path, they're not liberals.
[02:35:10.475 --> 02:35:11.196]  They're just...
[02:35:12.797 --> 02:35:16.099]  Selfish sociopaths and psychopaths that know that we have a conscience.
[02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:20.542]  And so they're trying to program us because we have feelings.
[02:35:21.663 --> 02:35:30.849]  And so we have to not have feelings for what they do and have feelings for our children and our culture and God, but not let them manipulate us.
[02:35:31.669 --> 02:35:33.010]  You have to learn to not have feelings.
[02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:35.912]  That's what they can't stand is, I don't care what they say or do to me.
[02:35:35.932 --> 02:35:37.753]  I just know they're liars.
[02:35:37.793 --> 02:35:38.414]  We're going to defeat them.
[02:35:38.954 --> 02:35:40.255]  People say, how do you handle all these attacks?
[02:35:40.275 --> 02:35:41.576]  It's a bunch of criminals.
[02:35:42.939 --> 02:35:46.961]  You know, if some child molester was in prison saying bad things about me, why would I care?
[02:35:47.861 --> 02:35:51.563]  Well, these child molesters and people, they mean nothing to me.
[02:35:51.683 --> 02:35:52.744]  I want them out of my life.
[02:35:53.184 --> 02:35:54.264]  But they won't leave me alone.
[02:35:55.465 --> 02:35:56.986]  So, I will crush them.
[02:35:59.387 --> 02:36:00.647]  And that's what this exercise is.
[02:36:00.907 --> 02:36:04.589]  I'm here to wage war on Soros and Hillary.
[02:36:04.709 --> 02:36:06.250]  I expect to be attacked.
[02:36:07.751 --> 02:36:08.631]  I expect to fight.
[02:36:10.888 --> 02:36:12.049]  And I expect to be destroyed.
[02:36:12.069 --> 02:36:16.151]  Because I intend to go where the action is.
[02:36:17.151 --> 02:36:22.774]  I intend to go into every battle and every place I can, whenever I can, as many times as I can.
[02:36:22.794 --> 02:36:31.158]  And I don't expect, in the great final continuum, to save my bacon.
[02:36:33.059 --> 02:36:34.580]  Because shaving my ass
[02:36:36.363 --> 02:36:38.926]  Means my children and this country and the world fails.
[02:36:39.627 --> 02:36:40.809]  And then we lose it all.
[02:36:42.811 --> 02:36:46.796]  And once you realize, think about losing humanity, your children, their future.
[02:36:46.956 --> 02:36:47.977]  Then you're like, I don't care.
[02:36:48.758 --> 02:36:49.119]  About me.
[02:36:49.299 --> 02:36:49.840]  Exactly!
[02:36:50.721 --> 02:36:54.565]  Because it's all about the continuum and stopping things like this.
[02:36:56.547 --> 02:36:57.607]  That's an abomination.
[02:36:57.767 --> 02:36:59.008]  That will not rule us.
[02:36:59.288 --> 02:37:00.328]  This will not control us.
[02:37:00.629 --> 02:37:01.689]  That will not control us.
[02:37:01.929 --> 02:37:06.151]  These husk, these demon-possessed monsters, they will fall forever!
[02:37:06.811 --> 02:37:11.593]  It won't always be the season of them crouched over our children, lapping up their blood.
[02:37:11.613 --> 02:37:14.914]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls and I apologize.
[02:37:14.954 --> 02:37:16.555]  I'm gonna get to everybody, but I gotta get to everybody quick now.
[02:37:17.195 --> 02:37:20.816]  A-Boss, Sam, David, everybody.
[02:37:20.836 --> 02:37:22.357]  We're gonna go to A-Boss in Idaho.
[02:37:22.897 --> 02:37:24.438]  What's the Dems' next move, A-Boss?
[02:37:26.397 --> 02:37:31.480]  Well, I just want to say that I really agree with Zach that we are winning, okay?
[02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:34.382]  And we have to really, really believe that.
[02:37:34.422 --> 02:37:40.186]  But we are winning, but the enemy can go and blow up a whole school full of kids and blame it on us.
[02:37:40.506 --> 02:37:41.547]  So what do we do when they do that?
[02:37:42.508 --> 02:37:44.069]  Well, and that's what I'm coming to.
[02:37:44.169 --> 02:37:49.092]  I honestly believe that what they're going to do... You know, you've been talking about the plan for the attack on the press.
[02:37:49.732 --> 02:37:51.994]  You know, I honestly don't think that they have the guts for that.
[02:37:52.314 --> 02:37:55.016]  Because first off, they might get injured in it, but they honestly...
[02:37:55.549 --> 02:37:57.190]  The false flag situation isn't working.
[02:37:57.210 --> 02:37:58.291]  There's too many eyes out there.
[02:37:58.771 --> 02:38:06.336]  But what I do think is going to happen is that this red wave is going to occur, and it is going to make these people literally go crazy.
[02:38:06.696 --> 02:38:07.717]  They're going to be out in the streets.
[02:38:08.077 --> 02:38:16.723]  And Alex, do you remember back when, in the Ukraine war, when it first started, okay, those people were out protesting against the police.
[02:38:17.223 --> 02:38:17.744]  What did they do?
[02:38:17.764 --> 02:38:19.305]  They got those dang Maidan.
[02:38:19.325 --> 02:38:20.826]  Do you remember the Maidan out there?
[02:38:21.246 --> 02:38:24.028]  Those Nazi Maidan, Euro Maidan, whatever you want to call them?
[02:38:24.919 --> 02:38:28.882]  And they started firing into themselves, into their own protesters, to get them riled up.
[02:38:29.142 --> 02:38:30.663]  The cops were forced to stay out there.
[02:38:30.983 --> 02:38:33.444]  They had to be there, because that was their job.
[02:38:33.745 --> 02:38:40.509]  And then finally, after they got the crowd riled up enough, they started shooting into the freaking cops to demoralize them, basically, and cause fear.
[02:38:40.989 --> 02:38:48.154]  So I honestly believe that they are going to follow the same George Soros plan that they've been following this entire time.
[02:38:48.574 --> 02:38:49.234]  It is a playbook.
[02:38:49.394 --> 02:38:53.637]  These people have such limited vision and no imagination.
[02:38:54.016 --> 02:38:58.100]  And I can tell you right now, it's enraging to watch how many lemmings are out on the street.
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:38:59.000]  It makes me sick.
[02:39:00.121 --> 02:39:00.602]  What do you think?
[02:39:01.863 --> 02:39:03.364]  Man, you're on fire, eh boss?
[02:39:03.384 --> 02:39:04.205]  We could keep going.
[02:39:04.305 --> 02:39:13.113]  That's how they took down Ukraine, was staging attacks on their own Nazi forces, and our own liberal media then backed literal Nazis taking over Ukraine.
[02:39:14.741 --> 02:39:15.362]  Absolutely.
[02:39:15.922 --> 02:39:19.125]  These people really can't think two steps ahead.
[02:39:20.866 --> 02:39:23.168]  I know you want to worry about, are we going to win?
[02:39:23.188 --> 02:39:23.869]  Are we going to win?
[02:39:23.929 --> 02:39:26.011]  How are we going to do it?
[02:39:26.531 --> 02:39:28.633]  But honestly, we are winning.
[02:39:29.313 --> 02:39:30.935]  And we're not really winning by our own
[02:39:32.576 --> 02:39:36.540]  We're carrying the fire of God, and you know, a lot of people out there get turned off when you start talking about God.
[02:39:36.821 --> 02:39:38.022]  I'm not going to shove it down their throats.
[02:39:38.342 --> 02:39:42.827]  But I'm telling you that right now, unless we walk with God in this, we will lose.
[02:39:43.248 --> 02:39:46.792]  And so we have to, every step, realize that we aren't the ones winning this.
[02:39:47.252 --> 02:39:50.095]  That we have to give it over to God, and He is going to win it for us.
[02:39:50.736 --> 02:39:51.077]  Alright?
[02:39:51.557 --> 02:39:52.278]  And you, my friend,
[02:39:52.731 --> 02:39:57.276]  I'm telling you, of all the years I've been watching you, I absolutely love you and your crew.
[02:39:57.716 --> 02:39:59.158]  And, you know, I've been praying for you.
[02:39:59.458 --> 02:40:03.142]  And what you're going through, you know, do not let them get you down.
[02:40:03.522 --> 02:40:04.904]  Do not let them get you down.
[02:40:05.184 --> 02:40:07.887]  Because you are going to come out of this squeaky clean.
[02:40:08.307 --> 02:40:08.567]  Alright?
[02:40:08.607 --> 02:40:11.470]  You will be remembered as a true blazing hero.
[02:40:11.731 --> 02:40:12.291]  And you know what?
[02:40:12.451 --> 02:40:13.753]  There's very few of us out there.
[02:40:14.119 --> 02:40:16.561]  And I'm not as big-scaled as you are.
[02:40:16.881 --> 02:40:19.122]  But dang it, I am out there, I am Kagan.
[02:40:19.162 --> 02:40:21.364]  I love those little stickers you guys send out with your problems.
[02:40:21.384 --> 02:40:24.346]  Hey brother, it's the little people that are the big people.
[02:40:25.086 --> 02:40:26.207]  Okay?
[02:40:27.047 --> 02:40:30.530]  Listen, I just want my children to have a future, and you're right.
[02:40:30.890 --> 02:40:31.210]  You know what?
[02:40:31.270 --> 02:40:32.851]  I want my children to have a future too, man.
[02:40:33.332 --> 02:40:35.153]  Globalists don't have any imagination, you're right.
[02:40:35.193 --> 02:40:36.173]  Beautiful call, eh boss?
[02:40:36.193 --> 02:40:36.834]  Call back again.
[02:40:37.274 --> 02:40:38.055]  Well, that was powerful.
[02:40:38.075 --> 02:40:39.976]  Let's talk to Sam in North Carolina.
[02:40:39.996 --> 02:40:41.177]  Sam, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:40:41.217 --> 02:40:41.457]  Go ahead.
[02:40:42.742 --> 02:40:43.882]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:40:43.903 --> 02:40:45.703]  What's up, brother?
[02:40:45.823 --> 02:40:49.325]  I just want to let you know that I was a former leftist in college.
[02:40:50.005 --> 02:40:53.567]  I ended up joining the Young Democratic Socialists, and I apologize.
[02:40:53.607 --> 02:40:54.847]  I'm walking to class right now.
[02:40:55.568 --> 02:41:00.149]  But these people are so radicalized and so insane.
[02:41:00.570 --> 02:41:07.092]  What you're speaking of earlier, what Abbas was talking about earlier, these people will try to revolt and cause a civil war.
[02:41:07.553 --> 02:41:08.133]  I know them.
[02:41:08.667 --> 02:41:21.835]  And if you look at what happened at UNC at Silent Sam, it was a Confederate monument dedicated to UNC students who went to go serve in the Civil War and died, and they toppled the monument.
[02:41:22.396 --> 02:41:26.878]  And the Confederate people showed up, and they held their Confederate flags, and the cops told them to leave.
[02:41:27.539 --> 02:41:31.601]  The cops also told the Democratic Socialist anarchist crowd to leave as well.
[02:41:32.162 --> 02:41:33.242]  What did they end up doing?
[02:41:33.602 --> 02:41:35.964]  They didn't leave, and they tried to fight the cops!
[02:41:36.798 --> 02:41:45.621]  And so we have these radical leftist anarchists who are in the streets trying to fight and kill police officers and just say, oh, I'm just anti-racist.
[02:41:45.641 --> 02:41:48.162]  Because that's how they brand themselves.
[02:41:48.382 --> 02:41:54.404]  And then when they're hitting cars with batons because white people are on it, and it's whites hitting it, screaming, F white people.
[02:41:54.885 --> 02:41:57.826]  It's like old people driving by, they're beating their car with batons.
[02:41:58.126 --> 02:42:01.227]  You effing white person, this is total mental illness.
[02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:10.205]  It is a complete, total mental illness, and so what I've been doing on campus is I've been trying to instigate these people to show their true colors.
[02:42:11.015 --> 02:42:15.256]  I go into the free expression area, and I put, these guys want civil war.
[02:42:15.556 --> 02:42:18.977]  And they show up the next day and they say, hell yes we want civil war.
[02:42:19.197 --> 02:42:22.898]  We want to arm the poor, we want to arm the workers, and then we'll get civil war.
[02:42:23.138 --> 02:42:27.459]  They put two cops, and demonic, like they put pentagrams all over the place.
[02:42:27.859 --> 02:42:31.220]  And I'm letting the public... Oh, exactly, they're all into Satanism.
[02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:33.001]  Tell us about that real quick, Sam, we'll come back.
[02:42:33.561 --> 02:42:38.502]  Oh yeah, if you look at the Antifa guy that kicks the pro-livers in the head, they're all wearing pentagrams.

[02:43:44.066 --> 02:43:47.048]  Paul Watson put out a video a few days ago, and I was blown away by it.
[02:43:47.108 --> 02:43:47.948]  This is big news!
[02:43:48.048 --> 02:43:51.991]  Former Misfits singer appearance cancelled after social media review.
[02:43:52.171 --> 02:43:52.951]  Michael Graves.
[02:43:53.331 --> 02:43:58.794]  And this is a big deal because they said, we reviewed him and it's white supremacy and all this made up crap.
[02:43:58.894 --> 02:44:02.196]  And so he's still going to be playing in the town, but this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[02:44:02.256 --> 02:44:03.257]  And what did he get in trouble for?
[02:44:03.277 --> 02:44:05.158]  Well, here he is to tell us right now.
[02:44:05.378 --> 02:44:07.719]  Alex, it really came out of the clear blue sky.
[02:44:07.739 --> 02:44:10.101]  My tour manager is also my guitar player.
[02:44:10.961 --> 02:44:20.088]  And I, we had a day off and we were working on some business and we found out about what happened after the festival had posted it.
[02:44:21.509 --> 02:44:31.397]  That they had, like you've said, reviewed my social sites and mainly saw retweets from Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars.
[02:44:32.512 --> 02:44:35.857]  Uh, from Breitbart, um, on and on.
[02:44:36.338 --> 02:44:43.850]  And it really is a sign of the times, Alex, because about 10 years ago, I went out on tour and did more than 50 states across America.
[02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:45.693]  It was called the War of Information Tour.
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:45:05.605]  And me and my guys, we were handing out InfoWars magazines, bumper stickers that other patriots would bring to us that they had stockpiled from ordering through InfoWars, and we were disseminating the information and getting the word out, and no one said, boo.
[02:45:06.045 --> 02:45:09.226]  No one cared that what we were doing.
[02:45:09.766 --> 02:45:13.127]  Now, jump to where we are in 2018, and
[02:45:17.085 --> 02:45:20.807]  This is a dangerous thing to come on your show like this.
[02:45:21.408 --> 02:45:28.091]  This will have repercussions, as everyone's seen, just from retweeting.
[02:45:28.172 --> 02:45:33.855]  And like you say, in the arena that you're in, you've hit the barbed wire for a lot of people.
[02:45:34.435 --> 02:45:51.686]  And we all appreciate that, and I certainly appreciate that you and your entire organization has given me, and a lot of other people, the courage to as well, in the arena that I fight in, music and art, cultural expression, to hit the barbed wire as well.
[02:45:51.766 --> 02:46:00.612]  And I hope that, and I know that there's other Patriots out there, there's a lot of young people that are paying attention to this, other bands, other artists, and
[02:46:01.272 --> 02:46:10.959]  The attack on me and seeing what I do and being articulate and being informed about it is going to give the courage and the cover.
[02:46:12.549 --> 02:46:18.292]  For other artists, other musicians to do this regardless of the consequences.
[02:46:18.552 --> 02:46:25.136]  Everybody standing up who's in the public eye and being persecuted, we're all equal when it comes to this on this continuum.
[02:46:25.256 --> 02:46:29.839]  And so for my children, my wife, my family, thank you for being a real man and we really appreciate you.
[02:46:29.859 --> 02:46:31.219]  I look forward to having you back on.
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:32.660]  Alex, thank you.
[02:46:32.740 --> 02:46:37.083]  God bless you, your family, your entire organization, everybody associated with you.
[02:46:37.463 --> 02:46:38.243]  Alex, thank you.
[02:46:38.423 --> 02:46:38.723]  Thank you.
[02:46:38.743 --> 02:46:39.284]  God bless you.
[02:46:44.415 --> 02:46:47.039]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:06.460 --> 02:47:09.561]  Alex Jones here back live, taking your phone calls.
[02:47:10.181 --> 02:47:13.883]  Fourth hour coming up with some extra treats and information.
[02:47:14.403 --> 02:47:29.348]  We've got on screen, if your TV viewer just did, just last week one of the well-known male feminists, whatever that means, wearing his pentagram and then he roundhouse kicks a pro-life woman in the face.
[02:47:29.368 --> 02:47:32.149]  And it turned out he's been videotaped assaulting other women.
[02:47:33.439 --> 02:47:38.442]  The other video I haven't gotten to of leftists grabbing a woman saying, I'm going to rape you.
[02:47:39.343 --> 02:47:39.963]  And she goes, no.
[02:47:40.003 --> 02:47:45.447]  And they go, no, you're anti-woman, so we're going to rape you.
[02:47:46.608 --> 02:47:49.189]  And then feminists come over and defend it on video.
[02:47:49.209 --> 02:47:50.550]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[02:47:50.570 --> 02:47:54.333]  We had the reporter that was attacked on the show yesterday.
[02:47:54.413 --> 02:47:55.173]  And he's grabbing her.
[02:47:55.193 --> 02:47:56.634]  He's trying to get on her.
[02:47:57.335 --> 02:47:59.776]  But it's OK, because he's a liberal, so she's a Nazi.
[02:47:59.836 --> 02:48:01.117]  So it's all right.
[02:48:01.157 --> 02:48:01.958]  You've been dehumanized.
[02:48:03.223 --> 02:48:09.445]  But let's go ahead and roll some of this audio, actually, of the Roundhouse guy kicking the pro-life woman in the head.
[02:48:09.465 --> 02:48:10.205]  Do we have the audio with us?
[02:48:12.546 --> 02:48:12.946]  Oh, we don't.
[02:48:13.066 --> 02:48:17.247]  Okay, well, TV viewers can see it where he kicks her in the face right here.
[02:48:18.468 --> 02:48:28.351]  But going back to Sam in North Carolina, yes, the average tattoos and the average garb of a leftist
[02:48:29.708 --> 02:48:36.849]  Uh, is pentagrams and abortion worship and wanting to destroy reality and wanting to attack Christians.
[02:48:37.389 --> 02:48:39.410]  So you're saying at your university, that's what they're doing?
[02:48:41.430 --> 02:48:43.371]  Uh, and they're doing it publicly.
[02:48:43.971 --> 02:48:48.912]  Uh, it's not just like they're, they're going out in defense of what they stand for.
[02:48:48.932 --> 02:48:50.252]  They're going on the offense.
[02:48:50.332 --> 02:48:53.392]  They're saying, yes, we do want to cause civil war.
[02:48:53.672 --> 02:48:53.913]  Yes.
[02:48:53.953 --> 02:48:55.513]  This is everything that we believe in.
[02:48:55.813 --> 02:48:56.393]  Cause I wrote,
[02:48:56.892 --> 02:48:58.113]  You guys want civil war?
[02:48:58.513 --> 02:49:00.013]  Everybody calls me delusional.
[02:49:00.033 --> 02:49:01.434]  They're like, oh, they don't want civil war.
[02:49:01.734 --> 02:49:03.035]  And then what do they come out and do?
[02:49:03.055 --> 02:49:04.896]  They go, hell yeah, we want civil war.
[02:49:05.336 --> 02:49:06.557]  It's absolute lunacy.
[02:49:07.257 --> 02:49:13.600]  If you remember two years back in North Carolina, the GOP headquarters in Orange County, I believe, got firebombed.
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:18.562]  They threw Molotov cocktails through the windows of the GOP headquarters.
[02:49:18.982 --> 02:49:20.303]  That happened two years ago.
[02:49:20.763 --> 02:49:22.884]  And I think a group of Democrats raised $13,000.
[02:49:25.138 --> 02:49:37.240]  Uh, in order to help rebuild, because, you know, after your political opponent gets firebombed, we all agree that firebombing is not a good political strategy, and so the community comes together to heal.
[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:47.262]  These people have been angry for two years that the Democrats helped out the Republicans rebuild their firebombed headquarters.
[02:49:47.302 --> 02:49:51.643]  They, you know, how dare you support, I won't repeat what they call them, but,
[02:49:52.188 --> 02:50:07.796]  It is absolutely insane that they endorse tactics such as firebombing your political opponents, calling for anarchy, giving guns to crackheads, and then they're like, oh yeah, we're the side of... What they want is power.
[02:50:07.876 --> 02:50:13.778]  What they want is to not do any work, be funded by Soros, with his rise-up garbage.
[02:50:14.359 --> 02:50:18.981]  But believe me, when they order them to go out and start killing, they're only going to be the cover.
[02:50:20.509 --> 02:50:22.390]  Yeah, Alex, good to talk with you.
[02:50:22.410 --> 02:50:24.511]  I've been listening for about 17 years, so it's great.
[02:50:24.551 --> 02:50:27.292]  What we wanted to bring up was the whole Kanye West thing.
[02:50:50.367 --> 02:51:00.245]  I find it super disturbing in how they're using the n-word on the news and it just kind of, to me, makes it... They want to try to keep black people with a victim mentality.
[02:51:00.405 --> 02:51:01.687]  Oh, and totally stirred up!
[02:51:01.807 --> 02:51:02.969]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[02:51:04.099 --> 02:51:10.043]  It really is, and I think that's kind of the Democratic plan, is to kind of like keep them on the plantation.
[02:51:10.623 --> 02:51:14.385]  Anytime like a conservative black person... Well that's what Kanye's saying, and that's why they're pissed.
[02:51:14.405 --> 02:51:16.146]  They go, he's crazy, he's dumb.
[02:51:16.527 --> 02:51:17.947]  A year and a half ago he endorsed Trump.
[02:51:18.328 --> 02:51:19.989]  His own family had him thrown...
[02:51:21.442 --> 02:51:28.347]  With the Baker Act, anybody can have it done, in a mental institution for a week, because he liked the President, who he already knew 10 years before!
[02:51:28.687 --> 02:51:30.128]  Kanye stayed at Trump's house!
[02:51:30.748 --> 02:51:32.910]  Man, let me tell you, I know Jesse James real good, he's a great guy.
[02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:34.471]  He stayed at Trump's house many times.
[02:51:34.871 --> 02:51:36.232]  I know a bunch of folks know Trump.
[02:51:36.492 --> 02:51:38.133]  Trump is like super cool, man.
[02:51:38.654 --> 02:51:41.476]  Kanye's hung out and stayed with him over a decade ago.
[02:51:41.856 --> 02:51:43.777]  Kanye knows, he's played at his hotels.
[02:51:44.258 --> 02:51:45.799]  Kanye knows it's a load of BS.
[02:51:47.019 --> 02:51:50.382]  They were friends before, and what, he's not allowed to be his friend now?
[02:51:51.946 --> 02:51:52.586]  Oh, it's incredible.
[02:51:52.907 --> 02:51:55.909]  And then they use the terms like, you know, House Negro and Uncle Tom.
[02:51:55.989 --> 02:52:00.111]  Those are terms for blacks that left the plantation to go live in the master's house.
[02:52:00.852 --> 02:52:07.496]  And they want to just try to keep black people in that mentality of... Instead, how about we just leave the entire plantation, all of us.
[02:52:08.096 --> 02:52:09.037]  That's what Kanye's saying.
[02:52:09.337 --> 02:52:12.139]  Let's not be in the master's house because there is no plantation.
[02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:13.800]  Exactly.
[02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:16.962]  And if we can just get black people to understand that Trump just wants to
[02:52:17.401 --> 02:52:21.865]  Let them thrive and not just survive what the Democrats do with their food stamps and all that stuff.
[02:52:24.207 --> 02:52:24.807]  No, you're right.
[02:52:24.947 --> 02:52:26.969]  It's just so sickening what they've done.
[02:52:27.209 --> 02:52:29.972]  And, you know, then, Kanye, you can only admire courage.
[02:52:30.212 --> 02:52:33.295]  You know, Jim Brown obviously has a lot of courage and has been conservative for a long time.
[02:52:33.335 --> 02:52:38.839]  But somebody like Kanye, you know, who's got everything to lose, and they're coming after him, and he's not backing down.
[02:52:38.859 --> 02:52:39.680]  You can only admire that.
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:40.320]  God bless you, David.
[02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:41.001]  Good to hear from you.
[02:52:41.862 --> 02:52:43.943]  Juan in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:52:44.464 --> 02:52:45.044]  You're on the air.
[02:52:45.084 --> 02:52:45.385]  Go ahead.
[02:52:46.587 --> 02:52:47.968]  Hey, how's it going, Mr. Jones?
[02:52:47.988 --> 02:52:49.730]  My first time from San Antonio.
[02:52:49.970 --> 02:52:50.531]  Welcome, sir.
[02:52:50.551 --> 02:52:51.131]  Thanks for calling.
[02:52:52.192 --> 02:52:53.013]  Hey, well, thank you.
[02:52:53.053 --> 02:52:54.134]  Thank you for informing us.
[02:52:54.434 --> 02:53:13.691]  Listen, I was just calling because I just read a report on NPSdigest.com, and it mentions that how they're going to begin to set attacks here through these riots, but the way they're going to do it is they're going to start spilling acid on people.
[02:53:14.554 --> 02:53:19.040]  And so from what I read was that Hillary Clinton met with the City of Mayer in London.
[02:53:20.022 --> 02:53:23.467]  And so they already did this in the city in London as well.
[02:53:23.487 --> 02:53:28.033]  Yeah, there's like seven acid attacks a day in London.
[02:53:29.355 --> 02:53:30.156]  Right, correct.
[02:53:31.164 --> 02:53:41.332]  So, anyhow, I was just letting you know that, according to this is on NPSdigest.com, it's been very accurate, because before even InfoWars or anybody else started talking about how Ms.
[02:53:41.392 --> 02:53:45.175]  Ford was related to the CIA, I already had that information.
[02:53:45.215 --> 02:53:49.279]  So they found that this website seems to be very trustworthy.
[02:53:49.319 --> 02:53:55.203]  Well, I mean, I want to ask myself, whoever the radical Islamist is, whatever, why would you
[02:53:55.984 --> 02:53:58.386]  Because they say randomly women are being attacked with acid.
[02:53:58.406 --> 02:54:00.747]  Good looking women that aren't wearing veils over their heads.
[02:54:01.248 --> 02:54:06.231]  And so you've got guys running around with buckets of acid that they cook up at their house, throwing it on a woman.
[02:54:06.271 --> 02:54:08.213]  It's like a, it's like an evil ritual.
[02:54:08.593 --> 02:54:11.395]  And so what are they, what's the reason?
[02:54:11.435 --> 02:54:12.536]  Like, why would you do that?
[02:54:14.297 --> 02:54:15.678]  Well, I don't know about the reason.
[02:54:15.698 --> 02:54:16.979]  You know, there's a lot of conflict.
[02:54:16.999 --> 02:54:19.500]  There's a lot of powerful institutions fighting among each other.
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:23.063]  You know, the war, you yourself know what's really going on behind the scenes, but
[02:54:23.621 --> 02:54:38.476]  Nevertheless, as a matter of fact, they told certain people from high powers of position from Russia here in the United States, who are here legally in the United States, not to attend these riots because there's going to be a lot of these types of terror attacks with acid.
[02:54:38.996 --> 02:54:41.499]  And so, from what I understand, this is all planned.
[02:54:41.539 --> 02:54:46.784]  And according to this report, I'm not saying according to this report because I don't want to be involved with slander, Ms.
[02:54:47.144 --> 02:54:47.565]  Clinton
[02:54:49.549 --> 02:54:53.603]  Well, I know this, and I appreciate your call.
[02:54:53.824 --> 02:54:54.386]  Antifa!
[02:54:55.612 --> 02:54:59.954]  Defecates in plastic bags and urinates in it, and then lets it stew into a rotting stew.
[02:55:00.575 --> 02:55:03.356]  And a guy rode by when we were leaving, protesting the Democrats.
[02:55:03.376 --> 02:55:09.539]  They were having a ban Alex Jones off the air, ban all conservatives, literally, hosted by the city of Austin and Walmart.
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:13.382]  I'm sure Walmart didn't know, but it was actually called, you know, banning the conservative meeting.
[02:55:13.922 --> 02:55:16.203]  And ban Alex Jones, ban Trump, you know, were fake news.
[02:55:16.763 --> 02:55:20.906]  And it mainly hit Owen and the other guy, Kyle.
[02:55:22.066 --> 02:55:22.987]  It only hit me a little bit.
[02:55:23.936 --> 02:55:27.577]  But he drove by on his bike with a bag and just threw it on us.
[02:55:28.217 --> 02:55:29.057]  And so that's what they do.
[02:55:29.097 --> 02:55:31.718]  They also will like get HIV and then stick you with needles.
[02:55:32.518 --> 02:55:33.318]  That's what the left does.
[02:55:33.358 --> 02:55:36.959]  I mean, their main cities are just cesspits of feces everywhere.
[02:55:36.979 --> 02:55:39.819]  And they all wear like anti-swastika outfits.
[02:55:40.059 --> 02:55:42.580]  Meanwhile, they're funded by Jordan Soros, a literal Nazi.
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:45.100]  So it's just the irony is not lost.
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:45.581]  God bless you.
[02:55:45.601 --> 02:55:48.781]  Appreciate the call from San Antonio, Texas, my friend.
[02:55:49.261 --> 02:55:49.601]  Luke.
[02:55:50.141 --> 02:55:51.342]  Luke Skywalker.
[02:55:51.622 --> 02:55:52.382]  Indeed you are.
[02:55:54.531 --> 02:55:55.131]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:55:56.272 --> 02:55:57.293]  How's it going, Mr. Jones?
[02:55:57.733 --> 02:55:58.573]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[02:55:58.814 --> 02:55:59.734]  I'm doing pretty good.
[02:56:00.274 --> 02:56:03.556]  I mean, other than what's happening politically, a lot of good stuff's happening in my life.
[02:56:03.576 --> 02:56:06.058]  A lot of prayers are being answered, so thanks for all your support.
[02:56:07.379 --> 02:56:07.979]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:08.119 --> 02:56:09.100]  I am fired up.
[02:56:09.180 --> 02:56:10.000]  I'm out here in Boise.
[02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:13.222]  Me and my friends, we go downtown every single weekend.
[02:56:13.262 --> 02:56:15.483]  We play that Alex Jones folks song, Loud and Proud.
[02:56:16.264 --> 02:56:17.024]  I'm out for people.
[02:56:17.064 --> 02:56:17.745]  We talk to people.
[02:56:17.805 --> 02:56:21.007]  Man, when you're talking to folks, you get one of two things.
[02:56:21.427 --> 02:56:23.148]  You get alive eyes.
[02:56:24.798 --> 02:56:39.749]  I was thinking about calling a new podcast I want to do weekly, Fire in the Eyes, because people either have the life or they're gone, and you're absolutely right.
[02:56:41.892 --> 02:56:42.332]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:42.512 --> 02:56:44.794]  And you know, we go down there, I've really been tapped.
[02:56:44.854 --> 02:56:48.977]  When you're saying, you know, you get that, you get tapped into the spirit and you can, you know, you really want to do good.
[02:56:49.558 --> 02:56:52.480]  I've been, I've been tapped into that, you know, sort of my whole life.
[02:56:52.540 --> 02:56:54.821]  I really started listening to you when I was 16.
[02:56:55.302 --> 02:57:03.788]  And then when I was 18, I got kicked off my broadcasting team in high school for trying to get some 9-11 truth out to my students, to my fellow students.
[02:57:04.388 --> 02:57:05.409]  But that's not long ago.
[02:57:05.469 --> 02:57:09.012]  I got a little prediction about what I think was going to happen to Hillary, if you'd like to hear.
[02:57:10.032 --> 02:57:10.473]  Stay there.
[02:57:10.513 --> 02:57:12.574]  We'll come right back with Luke in Idaho.
[02:57:12.615 --> 02:57:14.516]  Then we'll go to Mike and many others.
[02:57:14.616 --> 02:57:17.079]  And again, I always feel bad because we have like 25 phone lines.
[02:57:17.499 --> 02:57:19.401]  It's hard to always get to everybody, but we're trying.
[02:57:19.421 --> 02:57:22.283]  And we're doing a pretty good job going through the call, so we'll come back.
[02:57:22.303 --> 02:57:26.227]  And then I've got some excerpts of our nightly news coverage last night with myself and Owen Schroyer.
[02:57:27.068 --> 02:57:29.750]  It's every night, 8 to 10 p.m., election coverage.
[02:57:30.651 --> 02:57:31.072]  Now!
[02:57:33.093 --> 02:57:34.415]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:57:36.038 --> 02:57:38.119]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:57:38.399 --> 02:57:39.480]  I believe in you!
[02:57:39.900 --> 02:57:41.020]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:57:43.702 --> 02:57:45.683]  One man ever raped a woman!
[02:57:46.023 --> 02:57:47.604]  All genitals were cut off!
[02:57:47.884 --> 02:57:50.305]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:57:50.445 --> 02:57:51.665]  And we're not backing down ever!
[02:57:53.566 --> 02:57:54.707]  I wanna kick these people!
[02:57:54.747 --> 02:57:55.267]  We're winning!
[02:57:55.327 --> 02:57:56.428]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:57:56.588 --> 02:57:57.028]  Can't you?
[02:57:57.048 --> 02:57:58.949]  We have broken their back!
[02:57:59.329 --> 02:58:00.490]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:58:04.331 --> 02:58:04.892]  Let's go!
[02:58:06.286 --> 02:58:06.686]  Come on!
[02:58:06.706 --> 02:58:06.927]  Come on!

[02:58:22.261 --> 02:58:22.441]  Come on!
[02:58:22.581 --> 02:58:22.801]  Come on!
[02:58:22.821 --> 02:58:23.061]  Come on!
[02:58:23.121 --> 02:58:23.462]  Come on!
[02:58:23.482 --> 02:58:23.742]  Come on!
[02:58:23.842 --> 02:58:24.102]  Come on!
[02:58:24.142 --> 02:58:24.363]  Come on!
[02:58:24.383 --> 02:58:24.523]  Come on!
[02:58:24.603 --> 02:58:24.863]  Come on!
[02:58:24.903 --> 02:58:25.103]  Come on!
[02:58:25.123 --> 02:58:25.404]  Come on!
[02:58:25.484 --> 02:58:25.684]  Come on!
[02:58:25.704 --> 02:58:25.864]  Come on!
[02:58:25.924 --> 02:58:26.184]  Come on!
[02:58:26.204 --> 02:58:26.384]  Come on!
[02:58:26.404 --> 02:58:26.565]  Come on!
[02:58:26.585 --> 02:58:26.765]  Come on!
[02:58:26.805 --> 02:58:26.945]  Come on
[02:58:32.156 --> 02:58:34.517]  In fact, I thought about calling the Capitol Switchboard myself.
[02:58:34.577 --> 02:58:35.417]  Hello!
[02:58:35.917 --> 02:58:39.038]  My name's Alice, but I'm not gonna tell you who I am or where I am.
[02:58:39.438 --> 02:58:42.438]  Brett Kavanaugh gang-raped me with 14 elves.
[02:58:42.839 --> 02:58:44.919]  Yes, it was 49 years ago.
[02:58:45.059 --> 02:58:50.360]  And Brett Kavanaugh, he also flayed my skin and pulled my fingernails out with pliers.
[02:58:50.440 --> 02:58:54.261]  And then, he had an electric drill and he drilled my kneecaps.
[02:58:54.321 --> 02:58:55.562]  Yes, ma'am, we're very sorry.
[02:58:55.782 --> 02:58:56.722]  Now, this is anonymous.
[02:58:56.742 --> 02:59:00.763]  I'm not gonna tell you where or when, just... Okay, Kavanaugh's evil.
[02:59:00.843 --> 02:59:01.063]  Click!
[02:59:01.443 --> 02:59:05.906]  Anonymous accuser says Kavanaugh drilled their kneecaps with a Black & Decker drill!
[02:59:06.106 --> 02:59:06.887]  I can't look at her.
[02:59:07.007 --> 02:59:07.767]  It's like Hillary.
[02:59:07.807 --> 02:59:11.470]  There's the bug-eyed vampire bat look that these people have.
[02:59:11.710 --> 02:59:16.553]  And just knowing how she sits and perches on top of her students.
[02:59:16.853 --> 02:59:19.875]  These universities are these anti-free speech lie machines.
[02:59:20.115 --> 02:59:25.178]  And I've experienced the left and their victriolic fraud and their disinformation.
[02:59:25.299 --> 02:59:26.599]  So maybe I'm biased!
[02:59:34.855 --> 02:59:37.016]  You are receiving this transmission.
[02:59:37.076 --> 02:59:41.617]  You are the resistance.
[02:59:49.919 --> 02:59:54.901]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:54.941 --> 02:59:59.222]  Stories up on InfoWars.com!
[03:00:00.503 --> 03:00:01.463]  Run for the White House!
[03:00:02.441 --> 03:00:06.383]  Matt Drudge sees rising Dems superstar in Beto.
[03:00:07.183 --> 03:00:09.345]  Could this be what the Dems have been waiting for?
[03:00:09.885 --> 03:00:15.608]  Yeah, he's got that fake, washbush, blueblood, kind of retard talk and look.
[03:00:15.668 --> 03:00:17.169]  I mean, he's another piece of crap.
[03:00:17.929 --> 03:00:19.090]  So he's perfect.
[03:00:20.850 --> 03:00:22.911]  And I'm not putting down mentally retarded children.
[03:00:22.931 --> 03:00:29.135]  I mean, there's something about bluebloods, and they're always like, can hardly talk, and they're real neurotic, and they're real stupid, and they always have like...
[03:00:30.663 --> 03:00:31.904]  Ferret teeth and meowing.
[03:00:33.264 --> 03:00:34.465]  That's what the establishment likes.
[03:00:34.945 --> 03:00:36.906]  They're just soulless turd bags.
[03:00:38.466 --> 03:00:38.946]  I'm ranting.
[03:00:38.986 --> 03:00:40.407]  I'm so sick of hearing about Beto.
[03:00:40.427 --> 03:00:41.147]  I live in Austin.
[03:00:41.547 --> 03:00:42.768]  There's just Beto signs.
[03:00:44.829 --> 03:00:50.071]  I heard people are sticking Beto the pedo stickers on them or Beto the gun confiscator.
[03:00:50.731 --> 03:00:51.511]  People get stickers.
[03:00:51.531 --> 03:00:53.372]  They make it wherever they stick them on there.
[03:00:54.513 --> 03:00:56.313]  Because I'm really sick of this guy.
[03:00:56.793 --> 03:00:59.154]  He wants total open borders to ban people's guns.
[03:00:59.274 --> 03:01:00.175]  My God.
[03:01:01.693 --> 03:01:07.335]  And it's just, they're worshipping him like it's the second coming of a colostomy bag or something.
[03:01:07.695 --> 03:01:08.255]  I just don't know.
[03:01:08.695 --> 03:01:08.996]  Luke!
[03:01:10.396 --> 03:01:12.417]  What's your prediction for Hillary?
[03:01:13.737 --> 03:01:15.898]  Well, you see, she sold her soul.
[03:01:16.378 --> 03:01:16.878]  She's gone.
[03:01:17.599 --> 03:01:17.819]  Right?
[03:01:18.119 --> 03:01:19.079]  And she failed.
[03:01:19.999 --> 03:01:22.320]  And so now, they're gonna roll her out.
[03:01:22.660 --> 03:01:27.682]  Oh no, you're not gonna just get to retire in your little home you bought with all the sellout Chi-Com money.
[03:01:27.962 --> 03:01:30.283]  You're gonna roll out on your little wheelchair,
[03:01:30.990 --> 03:01:36.993]  And you're going to lose, because that's what they're going to try to do, to try to give this little foment.
[03:01:37.613 --> 03:01:41.415]  Oh, unify the Democratic Party against defeating the crooked Hillary.
[03:01:42.136 --> 03:01:44.257]  And that's what they're going to try to do to win the election.
[03:01:44.297 --> 03:01:45.317]  They know it's their only chance.
[03:01:45.377 --> 03:01:46.438]  They're going to sacrifice her.
[03:01:48.356 --> 03:01:56.464]  Well, there's a photo of her, you know, literally coming off of her black vehicle, her black ambulance, with the wheelchair.
[03:01:56.484 --> 03:01:58.126]  I mean, it is a fact.
[03:01:59.587 --> 03:02:03.230]  And again, they said it was a conspiracy theory that she has health problems.
[03:02:03.911 --> 03:02:05.573]  And they just lie to us like it's FDR.
[03:02:05.613 --> 03:02:07.154]  I mean, that's all they do.
[03:02:07.174 --> 03:02:08.716]  They have nothing but disdain for people.
[03:02:11.118 --> 03:02:11.598]  That's right.
[03:02:12.558 --> 03:02:13.318]  God bless you, Luke.
[03:02:13.338 --> 03:02:14.679]  Good to hear from you.
[03:02:15.059 --> 03:02:17.039]  And we got a ton of callers here that are awesome.
[03:02:17.059 --> 03:02:18.260]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:22.540]  Let's talk to Paul in North Carolina.
[03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:23.681]  He says he's a combat vet.
[03:02:24.041 --> 03:02:25.281]  Don't wear red at the polls.
[03:02:26.061 --> 03:02:27.021]  Left will attack you.
[03:02:27.581 --> 03:02:28.242]  I have no doubt.
[03:02:28.262 --> 03:02:29.802]  But don't let them stop you from going to the polls.
[03:02:31.502 --> 03:02:33.203]  But absolutely, get in there and get it done.
[03:02:33.863 --> 03:02:35.383]  What have you heard or what are you thinking, Paul?
[03:02:37.283 --> 03:02:37.984]  Hey, Alex.
[03:02:38.064 --> 03:02:39.424]  I'm a longtime fan.
[03:02:40.189 --> 03:02:41.390]  I love all your products.
[03:02:42.690 --> 03:02:42.990]  Thank you.
[03:02:43.471 --> 03:02:47.192]  And I just love your toothpaste.
[03:02:47.292 --> 03:02:51.915]  The Super Silver Rainforce X2.
[03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:54.516]  I'm a repeat offender.
[03:02:56.197 --> 03:02:57.417]  If you want to look at it that way.
[03:02:57.437 --> 03:02:58.758]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:02:58.778 --> 03:02:59.698]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[03:02:59.979 --> 03:03:00.559]  And that's the truth.
[03:03:01.610 --> 03:03:02.130]  I love you.
[03:03:02.270 --> 03:03:03.150]  I love you.
[03:03:03.171 --> 03:03:04.671]  That's why it's obscene when people thank me.
[03:03:05.231 --> 03:03:05.831]  Thank me?
[03:03:07.212 --> 03:03:08.772]  I'm as happy as a pig and you know what?
[03:03:08.832 --> 03:03:09.512]  Fighting the globalists.
[03:03:09.532 --> 03:03:10.433]  That's what we're supposed to do.
[03:03:11.453 --> 03:03:13.434]  We pray for you every single day in my house.
[03:03:14.194 --> 03:03:14.914]  Every single day.
[03:03:15.374 --> 03:03:17.695]  All those prayers that we're coming through.
[03:03:17.735 --> 03:03:19.655]  And that whole InfoWars crew as well.
[03:03:20.776 --> 03:03:21.196]  Thank you.
[03:03:21.636 --> 03:03:27.738]  But what I'm thinking about is I keep seeing on social media
[03:03:30.076 --> 03:03:34.218]  There's this constant encouragement for people to wear red.
[03:03:34.238 --> 03:03:35.279]  Wear red.
[03:03:35.839 --> 03:03:36.379]  Wear red.
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:37.180]  Okay?
[03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:40.722]  And this is starting to trouble me a little bit.
[03:03:41.082 --> 03:03:41.382]  I get it.
[03:03:41.402 --> 03:03:45.104]  You're saying we're wearing a uniform and they're getting ready to launch an offensive.
[03:03:45.144 --> 03:03:47.426]  Why would you wear something identifying for them to kill you?
[03:03:48.526 --> 03:03:54.650]  Well, I mean, red is really easy to see in the peripheral, you know, with a scope.
[03:03:54.930 --> 03:03:58.512]  And I'm thinking about these idiot moron lunatics.
[03:04:01.676 --> 03:04:03.816]  No, I agree.
[03:04:03.856 --> 03:04:10.138]  If they start a violent shooting war, you want to go wear an anti-fi outfit and get in the middle of them and, you know, bake them a cake.
[03:04:11.279 --> 03:04:23.122]  Well, I'm saying, like, at the voting, you know, where we're voting, you know, a large crowd of people wearing red, okay, is an easy target.
[03:04:23.942 --> 03:04:28.824]  I mean, and if they're up on a, you know, a rooftop or in a, you know,
[03:04:29.642 --> 03:04:30.883]  Hold on.
[03:04:30.903 --> 03:04:31.583]  Stay right there.
[03:04:31.603 --> 03:04:33.304]  I'm going to come back to you.
[03:04:33.384 --> 03:04:34.164]  Look at that.
[03:04:34.244 --> 03:04:38.006]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured.
[03:04:38.206 --> 03:04:39.567]  It's been watered down.
[03:04:39.587 --> 03:04:40.127]  We didn't do that.
[03:04:49.682 --> 03:04:53.783]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something, but this is the very best I can get?
[03:04:54.203 --> 03:04:55.863]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[03:04:56.444 --> 03:05:04.985]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[03:05:05.465 --> 03:05:07.146]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[03:05:07.206 --> 03:05:08.306]  Don't you get the big secret?
[03:05:08.966 --> 03:05:11.507]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[03:05:11.547 --> 03:05:12.647]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[03:05:13.407 --> 03:05:16.348]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[03:05:19.173 --> 03:05:20.513]  Liquid consciousness.
[03:05:23.915 --> 03:05:24.275]  Look it up.
[03:05:25.375 --> 03:05:25.875]  Find out.
[03:05:27.936 --> 03:05:31.377]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[03:05:31.417 --> 03:05:36.279]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[03:05:36.739 --> 03:05:38.940]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:39.840]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:05:54.284 --> 03:05:57.308]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:05:57.328 --> 03:06:00.251]  Run on for a long time.
[03:06:00.872 --> 03:06:03.014]  Run on for a long time.
[03:06:03.735 --> 03:06:06.138]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[03:06:06.719 --> 03:06:09.162]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[03:06:09.822 --> 03:06:19.510]  But the tree of liberty is water with the blood of patriots and tyrants and I think you have to be as wise as a serpent, as peaceful as a dove, but walk softly and carry a big stick.
[03:06:19.570 --> 03:06:20.691]  Alex Jones here back live.
[03:06:20.791 --> 03:06:22.633]  Going right back to your phone calls.
[03:06:23.073 --> 03:06:24.054]  Really great calls today.
[03:06:29.730 --> 03:06:36.074]  If you're in red state areas, it's great to wear Trump hats and everything, to have solidarity, to promote free speech.
[03:06:36.154 --> 03:06:42.357]  And in targeted times, it's only in areas like San Francisco or downtown Austin where you get yelled at or screamed at wearing one.
[03:06:42.658 --> 03:06:46.340]  And it's good to exercise it like Kanye's doing, just to promote free speech and say, I'm not a slave.
[03:06:46.360 --> 03:06:48.081]  I don't mean that because he's black.
[03:06:48.121 --> 03:06:49.922]  I mean, for all of us, we're not slaves to these people.
[03:06:50.943 --> 03:06:52.063]  Tell us what we can and can't say.
[03:06:52.103 --> 03:06:53.104]  That's so fundamental.
[03:06:54.685 --> 03:06:58.307]  It's their desperation that's made them show their true authoritarianism.
[03:07:00.250 --> 03:07:05.114]  But yeah, I think statistically you're not going to have an issue.
[03:07:05.214 --> 03:07:09.818]  But still, if you're the place where the Dems blow something up or shoot people, it won't matter, you'll be dead.
[03:07:13.123 --> 03:07:17.845]  There's no point in me, unless I'm videotaping it, to show how violent they are, to go out and look for trouble.
[03:07:18.706 --> 03:07:35.114]  So, sometimes, even if I want to go out to eat with my kids or something, I'll wear like a cap or something, and in a big crowd of people, I won't even talk too much, because a lot of the time, I've just got to get somewhere, and fans will come over, and they're great, but I've got to get where I'm going, so I've got to shake everybody's hand, which I love doing, it's just that I've got to get somewhere.
[03:07:35.954 --> 03:07:39.399]  But yeah, I mean, I think everybody identifying wearing red is like a uniform.
[03:07:39.859 --> 03:07:41.662]  So it is very good to get the word out.
[03:07:42.202 --> 03:07:48.591]  But you have to know that when you're doing that, you're doing it for a specific reason, especially if it says Trump Pants 2020.
[03:07:49.172 --> 03:07:50.133]  We sell those shirts.
[03:07:50.633 --> 03:07:51.855]  It's like choose your own adventure.
[03:07:52.195 --> 03:07:53.637]  Wear a Molon Labe shirt.
[03:07:54.238 --> 03:07:56.481]  That the antifa meth heads aren't going to know what that means.
[03:07:57.121 --> 03:07:58.443]  They're just getting a paycheck from Soros.
[03:07:58.503 --> 03:08:01.106]  But they will know what a Make America Great Again is.
[03:08:01.566 --> 03:08:03.428]  And they have no real power themselves.
[03:08:03.768 --> 03:08:04.409]  So they're cowards.
[03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:10.275]  You'll be sitting there at a cafe when they hit you in the back of the head with a bike lock or a chair and then run off.
[03:08:10.896 --> 03:08:24.206]  And so yeah, I would not turn my back and I would not take my children out wearing a Make America Great Again hat in any big city in America because they got a lot of brainwashed weirdos that will attack you.
[03:08:24.226 --> 03:08:32.372]  So it's like putting on a battle uniform basically or even a dress uniform and going out and doing it with a bunch of meth head devil worshippers around.
[03:08:32.773 --> 03:08:34.374]  So if you do it, you got to be ready.
[03:08:35.615 --> 03:08:36.716]  What's your take on that, Paul?
[03:08:37.897 --> 03:08:39.658]  Well, what I was thinking is
[03:08:40.676 --> 03:08:44.299]  When we go to the voting, it doesn't matter where you are to go vote.
[03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:46.561]  Um, to be invisible.
[03:08:47.282 --> 03:08:50.464]  Okay, vote red to be invisible.
[03:08:50.484 --> 03:08:57.190]  All right, because I think that these they know that they're going to get the butt kick.
[03:08:59.251 --> 03:09:02.314]  I believe that that they that they know that they're going to get the butt kick.
[03:09:03.054 --> 03:09:04.175]  And so what are they going to do?
[03:09:04.716 --> 03:09:06.077]  You're always asking that Alex.
[03:09:06.617 --> 03:09:07.578]  What are they going to do next?
[03:09:09.573 --> 03:09:10.768]  I'm thinking of basically...
[03:09:11.255 --> 03:09:15.336]  A whole bunch of people that are proud, and I can understand pride.
[03:09:15.996 --> 03:09:22.077]  You know, I'm not... You're saying it might trigger them like anybody trying to have a Trump demonstration in America, Antifa shows up.
[03:09:22.617 --> 03:09:26.858]  Well, not everywhere now, because I heard some of them fell down and hit their heads, but wow, imagine that.
[03:09:28.118 --> 03:09:30.079]  But you also know there's other forces involved here.
[03:09:30.339 --> 03:09:36.360]  You know, Antifa is, a little bird told me, is getting followed back to their houses when they beat up women and children now.
[03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:40.161]  I heard like a week or two later, they fall down the stairs, Paul.
[03:09:42.667 --> 03:09:43.067]  Yeah.
[03:09:44.428 --> 03:09:44.928]  Yeah.
[03:09:45.168 --> 03:09:46.189]  And a bunch of witnesses.
[03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.569]  Yeah.
[03:09:46.729 --> 03:09:49.111]  And, uh, yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:09:49.131 --> 03:09:50.832]  You just fell down the steps.
[03:09:51.452 --> 03:09:52.333]  I know all about that.
[03:09:53.113 --> 03:09:55.675]  But you're the one that keeps asking this Alex.
[03:09:56.356 --> 03:09:57.937]  You know, what are they going to do next?
[03:09:58.697 --> 03:10:07.963]  I'm thinking that if a lot of people that are proud of, you know who they're voting for and what side they're on and everything like that, I can understand the pride.
[03:10:09.737 --> 03:10:14.439]  If they're in a big crowd like that, there's some mental patient on the left.
[03:10:14.599 --> 03:10:15.560]  Oh, I totally agree!
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:21.163]  You heard about this leftist who confessed to the 200 pound bomb that was gonna blow up the mall, right?
[03:10:22.383 --> 03:10:25.785]  Or just like Las Vegas, the Las Vegas shooting.
[03:10:26.665 --> 03:10:26.985]  Okay?
[03:10:27.005 --> 03:10:31.488]  I mean, how far away was that shooter from that crowd of people?
[03:10:32.388 --> 03:10:32.608]  Right?
[03:10:33.869 --> 03:10:36.370]  And just imagine like a bunch of people dressed in red.
[03:10:36.789 --> 03:10:37.829]  Paul, great point.
[03:10:37.869 --> 03:10:38.729]  People should think about it.
[03:10:38.769 --> 03:10:39.570]  Thank you so much.
[03:10:40.750 --> 03:10:42.290]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[03:10:42.370 --> 03:10:43.091]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:10:43.111 --> 03:10:43.671]  Thanks for holding.
[03:10:45.891 --> 03:10:46.751]  Hey, Alex.
[03:10:47.912 --> 03:10:53.353]  I would like to say, you know, degenerate, psychopathic, dropulous, control-free.
[03:10:54.173 --> 03:10:57.654]  It's a good way to describe these people.
[03:10:57.914 --> 03:11:03.595]  You know, I remember back when you sat in front of a curtain with headphones on your head.
[03:11:03.635 --> 03:11:04.996]  I remember back when you predicted 9-11.
[03:11:06.044 --> 03:11:10.367]  I've been around listening to you that long, and you asked earlier, you know, 10 segments of Dorsey's.
[03:11:12.048 --> 03:11:12.389]  Great.
[03:11:13.109 --> 03:11:17.072]  And man, I mean, you remember because you were a day member.
[03:11:17.853 --> 03:11:23.217]  I cannot believe how far we couldn't exaggerate.
[03:11:23.277 --> 03:11:25.678]  You wouldn't even have exaggerated this far then.
[03:11:25.979 --> 03:11:26.939]  It's crazy.
[03:11:26.959 --> 03:11:30.642]  I urge everybody who's listening right now, don't just listen to Alex.
[03:11:31.314 --> 03:11:38.737]  Go on YouTube and watch Kanye talk in the Oval Office yesterday, because it really had a big impact on me.
[03:11:38.897 --> 03:11:43.338]  I was supporting him already, but man, you've got to hear him and you're going to understand.
[03:11:43.358 --> 03:11:47.420]  I wanted to touch on that one more thing I wanted to ask Alex.
[03:11:48.408 --> 03:11:53.949]  Um, brother, is, uh, I have been searching around and I've heard you touch on it, but you didn't get into it too much.
[03:11:53.969 --> 03:11:58.531]  You talked about how you're going to, you're getting out of the iPhone, you're going back to PCs.
[03:11:58.611 --> 03:12:00.011]  I did the same thing years ago.
[03:12:00.031 --> 03:12:10.694]  I went to Mac just because of the program, the infrastructure, it made sense, you know, but I'm on a, my, uh, Tricom spy device right now talking to you and I want out.
[03:12:11.314 --> 03:12:15.195]  And I, I would like to put together some kind of a,
[03:12:16.008 --> 03:12:24.437]  Well, no, I agree.
[03:12:24.477 --> 03:12:32.865]  We should look at companies that have smartphones that aren't owned by the evil Chinese communists, that aren't putting spy chips on them, and they're all platforms of Trojan horses.
[03:12:32.925 --> 03:12:34.567]  It's just Apple's the worst.
[03:12:34.927 --> 03:12:35.228]  Bye!
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:37.821]  I don't know the answer.
[03:12:55.245 --> 03:12:55.985]  I don't know the answer.
[03:12:56.005 --> 03:12:57.046]  I was always a PC guy.
[03:12:57.066 --> 03:13:03.367]  Then like 19 years ago, we moved over to Mac because they had good, cheaper video editing processing.
[03:13:03.387 --> 03:13:07.809]  And then, you know, there were more bugs in PC, so I kind of liked the Mac level at that point.
[03:13:08.349 --> 03:13:10.750]  But this is not the company Steve Jobs started.
[03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:12.870]  Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids have iPads.
[03:13:12.890 --> 03:13:13.750]  Now everybody's got them.
[03:13:14.191 --> 03:13:15.151]  And so you're absolutely right.
[03:13:15.191 --> 03:13:15.871]  God bless you, Mike.
[03:13:15.891 --> 03:13:16.551]  Good to hear from you.
[03:13:17.031 --> 03:13:17.371]  Yeah, I know.
[03:13:17.411 --> 03:13:17.912]  It's here.
[03:13:17.992 --> 03:13:18.552]  It's going on.
[03:13:19.832 --> 03:13:21.213]  Let's go ahead and get another caller in here.
[03:13:21.253 --> 03:13:21.873]  Let's talk to...
[03:13:26.377 --> 03:13:28.658]  Talk to Jason in New Mexico.
[03:13:28.678 --> 03:13:31.419]  Let's talk Trump, Kanye meeting, and Larry Hoover.
[03:13:31.459 --> 03:13:31.819]  Go ahead.
[03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:34.280]  Thank you very much for taking my call, sir.
[03:13:34.701 --> 03:13:35.821]  I'm going to get right to it.
[03:13:36.401 --> 03:13:38.782]  Kanye tipped the scale by mentioning Larry Hoover.
[03:13:39.103 --> 03:13:42.704]  And the thing that the Democrats hate the most is an empowered black man.
[03:13:43.044 --> 03:13:53.409]  And you can look at the history and look at Malcolm X. He didn't get killed until he started going against the Democratic Party and started speaking to black people about... Yeah, he said the Democratic Party's worse and they're the ones of slavery.
[03:13:53.889 --> 03:13:58.519]  He said the Republicans aren't perfect, but listen, the Democrats are the ones that are domesticating you to control you.
[03:13:58.539 --> 03:14:03.209]  And then when he stopped doing the whole race thing where all whites are evil, that's when they killed him.
[03:14:04.483 --> 03:14:04.963]  Exactly.
[03:14:05.263 --> 03:14:23.593]  And so the same deal with Larry Hoover, when Kanye mentioned Larry Hoover, which is the founder of the Black Gangster Disciples, but he changed his life and started the growth and development curriculum, this basically would overnight instantly gain that urban support if Trump was to pardon him or commence his sentence.
[03:14:23.633 --> 03:14:28.616]  Because what Larry Hoover was doing was actually starting to reform and reshape Chicago.
[03:14:28.896 --> 03:14:31.077]  And if you look at the state of what Chicago is in now,
[03:14:31.497 --> 03:14:47.402]  They couldn't have him get political and they only gave him the six life sentences because I believe he started to get political, empower his community, let them know that we need to have the factories, the jobs, everything that would empower young men to stay in the houses, everything that Kanye said.
[03:14:47.622 --> 03:14:47.842]  Okay.
[03:15:04.005 --> 03:15:04.685]  Oh, you're right.
[03:15:04.766 --> 03:15:10.069]  And the Democratic Party thinks they own everybody, but they really get territorial about black people and black men.
[03:15:10.649 --> 03:15:15.192]  Like Hillary's saying, black men are predators, and we need to keep them to heal like a dog.
[03:15:15.612 --> 03:15:16.633]  God bless you, Jason.
[03:15:16.953 --> 03:15:18.014]  There's an awakening worldwide.
[03:15:18.054 --> 03:15:18.394]  It's huge.
[03:15:18.734 --> 03:15:22.056]  I'm sorry to all the other callers, but we got these clips coming up from last night that were powerful.
[03:15:23.937 --> 03:15:24.878]  So that's gonna happen.
[03:15:24.918 --> 03:15:26.099]  And then the war room's coming up.
[03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:27.901]  Thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[03:15:27.981 --> 03:15:28.522]  I'm humbled.
[03:15:28.962 --> 03:15:29.843]  I appreciate you all.
[03:15:29.863 --> 03:15:31.765]  Without your financial support, we will be shut down.
[03:15:32.125 --> 03:15:33.066]  But you've been coming through.
[03:15:33.527 --> 03:15:36.210]  These big specials have got to end soon as we're selling out of so many products.
[03:15:36.530 --> 03:15:38.252]  Biggest sale ever in fullwarrestore.com.
[03:15:40.401 --> 03:15:46.684]  There are a lot of people out there on television, radio, and on the internet, and print, telling you that they've got the answers.
[03:15:46.744 --> 03:15:47.824]  They know how the world really works.
[03:15:48.645 --> 03:15:51.166]  The funny thing is, nobody tries to shut them down.
[03:15:51.226 --> 03:15:53.007]  Nobody tries to keep them quiet.
[03:15:53.027 --> 03:15:59.890]  Because they're like a bunch of brainwashed, lobotomized monkeys running around, not knowing what they're really doing.
[03:16:01.050 --> 03:16:08.394]  But in full wars, now Hillary Clinton and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the EU and the CHICOMS, they want us shut down.
[03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:14.083]  Because you see, I actually read the Chinese Communist Establishment Party newspapers.
[03:16:14.103 --> 03:16:18.206]  I actually read the Council on Foreign Relations bimonthly publication of Foreign Affairs.
[03:16:18.847 --> 03:16:24.671]  I've actually read hundreds and hundreds of books written by people like David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[03:16:24.691 --> 03:16:27.152]  So I know their larger game plan.
[03:16:28.033 --> 03:16:30.495]  I know the operation they're carrying out against humanity.
[03:16:30.915 --> 03:16:33.157]  And so, because I have their number, they want me shut down.
[03:16:33.917 --> 03:16:37.638]  You've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us.
[03:16:37.718 --> 03:16:43.619]  You've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away so we can't even process orders.
[03:16:44.319 --> 03:16:49.100]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[03:16:49.161 --> 03:16:54.242]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[03:16:55.922 --> 03:17:09.171]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[03:17:09.771 --> 03:17:13.954]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[03:17:15.094 --> 03:17:20.578]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globalists coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[03:17:20.858 --> 03:17:21.959]  Black Friday's coming early.
[03:17:22.822 --> 03:17:24.002]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[03:17:24.142 --> 03:17:28.483]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed, starting now.
[03:17:29.063 --> 03:17:34.445]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[03:17:35.265 --> 03:17:42.766]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[03:17:43.666 --> 03:17:45.807]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[03:17:47.003 --> 03:17:56.988]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world, after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[03:17:57.409 --> 03:18:02.131]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[03:18:02.611 --> 03:18:05.793]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[03:18:06.413 --> 03:18:11.396]  And so now they're coming after our ability at InfoWarsTore.com to even have credit card processing.
[03:18:11.416 --> 03:18:14.658]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[03:18:15.678 --> 03:18:17.180]  Get your X2.
[03:18:17.460 --> 03:18:19.863]  Even though it's selling out in the last run, 50% off.
[03:18:20.223 --> 03:18:22.086]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[03:18:22.466 --> 03:18:23.928]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[03:18:24.629 --> 03:18:26.271]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[03:18:26.311 --> 03:18:28.653]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[03:18:28.994 --> 03:18:30.936]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off.
[03:18:31.437 --> 03:18:32.458]  But they're discounted as well.
[03:18:32.698 --> 03:18:32.838]  And...

[03:18:55.766 --> 03:19:00.208]  They know you always come through, which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability

[03:19:29.897 --> 03:19:30.758]  I'm counting on you.
[03:19:31.018 --> 03:19:31.939]  You always come through.
[03:19:32.259 --> 03:19:33.020]  Take advantage of this.
[03:19:33.060 --> 03:19:35.183]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[03:19:44.346 --> 03:19:46.969]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.085 --> 03:20:11.493]  Caitlin, I mean you were there breathing this guy's nauseous breath right in your face.
[03:20:11.853 --> 03:20:16.260]  I commend you and he's grabbing you for not smacking him upside the head.
[03:20:16.320 --> 03:20:17.041]  This is incredible.
[03:20:18.103 --> 03:20:23.187]  Well, if anyone knows anything about me, it's that I carry a firearm everywhere I go.
[03:20:24.068 --> 03:20:29.352]  And I don't think that man, because he's so old and crazy, even knew about me.
[03:20:29.472 --> 03:20:31.293]  But there were other women there who did.
[03:20:31.313 --> 03:20:34.295]  One actually got in my face and said she was going to punch me.
[03:20:34.355 --> 03:20:41.081]  And I just kindly and calmly reminded her who I am and that I do carry a firearm.
[03:20:41.181 --> 03:20:43.462]  And boy, did she turn around after that.
[03:20:43.943 --> 03:20:47.966]  So, you know, they should be out there talking about women's right to
[03:20:48.066 --> 03:20:48.326]  I don't know.
[03:20:58.243 --> 03:20:59.263]  I just don't know.
[03:20:59.323 --> 03:21:01.664]  Well, we commend you, but I've got to ask you this question.
[03:21:01.744 --> 03:21:04.685]  You've traveled all the country now, like Millie Weaver and other great reporters have.
[03:21:05.225 --> 03:21:06.345]  We don't have to cherry pick.
[03:21:06.425 --> 03:21:12.107]  Owen would do like three, four hour long, still does, Facebooks and YouTubes, and they get millions of views.
[03:21:12.227 --> 03:21:16.588]  And it's like one person after the next act like gibbering mental patients.
[03:21:16.648 --> 03:21:20.309]  And we're not like feeling powerful that they've released the state hospital.
[03:21:20.649 --> 03:21:22.170]  But I mean, you go to a Democrat event,
[03:21:23.470 --> 03:21:30.974]  They, I don't care what color they are, they look like they got beat with a mentally ill stick and they're just drooling.
[03:21:31.554 --> 03:21:32.294]  They're racist.
[03:21:32.334 --> 03:21:41.098]  You'll see white people call black cops the n-word and then the media, I mean it's like a license to act like animals.
[03:21:41.178 --> 03:21:42.019]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:21:43.939 --> 03:21:50.281]  Well, it is mentally ill people, and there's a lot of reasons how they've reached that point.
[03:21:50.802 --> 03:21:56.964]  But they've now been hit with the messaging and hit with the propaganda at the right time to activate them.
[03:21:57.144 --> 03:21:58.444]  And it's all about justification.
[03:21:58.484 --> 03:21:59.564]  I mean, Alex, let's be real.
[03:22:00.065 --> 03:22:10.368]  If you really believed there was a Nazi KKK member as the United States president, if you really believed there was a serial gang rapist on the Supreme Court,
[03:22:10.968 --> 03:22:13.932]  Maybe you do have a little justification to want to do something.
[03:22:14.032 --> 03:22:15.314]  But that's not even true!
[03:22:15.334 --> 03:22:16.255]  It's beyond that.
[03:22:16.355 --> 03:22:19.019]  It's like... It's the justification.
[03:22:19.039 --> 03:22:20.601]  Like, they're being screwed by the globalists.
[03:22:21.062 --> 03:22:26.349]  But they're in love with running around and freaking... And they're all... Here's what it is.
[03:22:27.452 --> 03:22:28.873]  That guy's obviously on oxygen.
[03:22:28.893 --> 03:22:30.034]  A lot of people are.
[03:22:30.334 --> 03:22:31.215]  He's on disability.
[03:22:31.796 --> 03:22:33.017]  They're all on welfare.
[03:22:33.517 --> 03:22:34.778]  It's what Mitt Romney said was true.
[03:22:36.360 --> 03:22:37.280]  47.9% don't work.
[03:22:37.881 --> 03:22:38.782]  They're being manipulated.
[03:22:38.802 --> 03:22:40.563]  A big, rich, free market could take care of them.
[03:22:41.004 --> 03:22:43.145]  But like Venezuela, no one gets any welfare now.
[03:22:43.846 --> 03:22:44.687]  But they don't get that.
[03:22:44.767 --> 03:22:49.814]  So the truth is, they're just pissed and think the workers aren't going to give them free stuff.
[03:22:50.175 --> 03:22:55.322]  So they're just out there to intimidate you and say, I'm going to rape your ass, woman, if you don't give me my goddamn money.
[03:22:55.542 --> 03:22:57.806]  Excuse me for saying that, but go ahead, Kaitlin Bennett.
[03:22:59.028 --> 03:23:05.795]  So, Owen, you guys were talking about them being mentally ill and they look like they just came out of a mental health facility.
[03:23:06.196 --> 03:23:13.324]  I actually talked to one woman who held up a sign that said the GOP hates women and I just asked a very objective question.
[03:23:13.344 --> 03:23:19.691]  I said, what do you think about the women who do vote for Trump and who do align with the right-wing ideology?
[03:23:20.191 --> 03:23:34.219]  And she said that she feels the only reason women ever align to the right wing is because they have experienced trauma in their life that has left them with PTSD and some type of mental health defect.
[03:23:34.779 --> 03:23:37.820]  And I'll release that video as soon as it's edited and we find it.
[03:23:37.881 --> 03:23:42.663]  It is literally the holy team of men and women together that have built the world.
[03:23:43.043 --> 03:23:45.184]  That men and women together is the power.
[03:23:45.204 --> 03:23:45.545]  Go ahead.
[03:23:45.565 --> 03:23:46.045]  Talk about that.
[03:23:48.786 --> 03:23:51.807]  Yeah, I mean, we have women's marches.
[03:23:51.887 --> 03:23:52.727]  We can see it right now.
[03:23:52.807 --> 03:23:56.727]  Women's marches are going around and they just chant at everything.
[03:23:57.128 --> 03:24:00.808]  They can't come together and actually build something.
[03:24:00.828 --> 03:24:03.609]  All they do is brainwash people.
[03:24:03.629 --> 03:24:14.691]  But men and women coming together, we have those family values, the traditional values that sustain a family and have the working class and everything.
[03:24:14.751 --> 03:24:15.211]  And it's just
[03:24:16.527 --> 03:24:18.769]  Of course the globalists want to get in the middle of men and women.
[03:24:18.789 --> 03:24:19.630]  That's the species.
[03:24:19.890 --> 03:24:20.870]  That's the power.
[03:24:23.252 --> 03:24:24.293]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:24:24.333 --> 03:24:27.075]  I mean, I'm happy with who I am.
[03:24:27.095 --> 03:24:28.676]  Tell us about your political process.
[03:24:29.016 --> 03:24:29.537]  Get into it.
[03:24:29.657 --> 03:24:30.417]  You never do this on air.
[03:24:30.437 --> 03:24:36.722]  Get into your family, your process, where you grew up, what got you politically involved with hundreds of millions of views now, just the last six months.
[03:24:36.782 --> 03:24:40.264]  I mean, you've exploded out there, and you're an example to other women and men.
[03:24:40.284 --> 03:24:41.565]  Tell us about yourself.
[03:24:43.322 --> 03:24:51.308]  So, in high school, I started to kind of understand more of the political ideology that was around me.
[03:24:51.528 --> 03:24:55.651]  I had an English teacher who was so left-wing.
[03:24:55.951 --> 03:25:04.798]  She had a Hillary Clinton bobblehead on her desk, and I just kind of was like, would it be okay if someone had, like, a Reagan bobblehead on their desk?
[03:25:04.918 --> 03:25:11.503]  And she tried to push a lot of her socialist ideology onto the class, and I would always be that person that would
[03:25:12.684 --> 03:25:20.629]  No, I actually wrote a paper against teacher unions to her and when I turned it in I said, please don't grade it badly just because I disagree with you.
[03:25:21.069 --> 03:25:30.495]  She ended up being one of the best teachers I had and she helped me more understand my viewpoint because I could disagree with her and I could listen to the other side.
[03:25:30.535 --> 03:25:31.796]  I had to, she was in my class.
[03:25:32.737 --> 03:25:36.279]  But going through college, when I went to Kent State,
[03:25:36.679 --> 03:25:40.060]  That was the first time I really experienced the indoctrination.
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:52.103]  It wasn't really bad in high school, but when I got here, one of the first things I witnessed was a Black Lives Matter protest on campus trying to shut down the Black Squirrel Festival that Kent has every year.
[03:25:52.123 --> 03:25:54.384]  And I was just, I was freaking out.
[03:25:54.424 --> 03:25:56.625]  I was like, oh my gosh, this is a culture shock.
[03:25:56.665 --> 03:26:00.946]  Like, I live in the middle of nowhere in Zanesville, and I see this stuff.
[03:26:02.380 --> 03:26:07.358]  And like your Skype's breaking up, but they're like saying that a black saying black squirrel is racist?
[03:26:10.554 --> 03:26:12.514]  No, they just wanted to, like, shut it down.
[03:26:12.534 --> 03:26:13.895]  They wanted to block everybody.
[03:26:13.915 --> 03:26:20.676]  Sure, because I saw the university that said that it was Lynch Hall, which is an Irish name, but Lynch could be associated with lynching someone.
[03:26:20.936 --> 03:26:24.477]  So they changed the name because the word Lynch was scary.
[03:26:24.517 --> 03:26:26.197]  So you, same thing with me.
[03:26:26.377 --> 03:26:29.577]  I witnessed going to college a few years that was all worthless disinfo.
[03:26:29.597 --> 03:26:31.278]  Already had a sales job, was successful.
[03:26:32.158 --> 03:26:35.659]  And all it was was America bashing, no matter what the class was.
[03:26:36.159 --> 03:26:38.019]  And I was like, God, this is authoritarianism.
[03:26:39.969 --> 03:26:41.210]  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.
[03:26:41.270 --> 03:26:54.682]  When I was in my architecture class, he was going on about how women should be pro-abortion and pro-choice, and he was going on about how gay he was, and I'm like, dude, no one cares that you're gay, but we want to learn about the Taj Mahal so we can pass our exams.
[03:26:54.702 --> 03:26:56.864]  Yeah, why is a gay dude like, kill your baby?
[03:26:56.884 --> 03:26:58.826]  It's really sexy, because David Rockefeller said so.
[03:27:00.313 --> 03:27:05.597]  So after I dealt with that, I realized there were no conservatives on campus standing up for themselves.
[03:27:05.637 --> 03:27:08.519]  So I just said, OK, I'll be that person then.
[03:27:08.679 --> 03:27:10.441]  And I was so shy.
[03:27:10.861 --> 03:27:16.265]  I did not like putting myself out there, but I just got so sick of seeing
[03:27:16.645 --> 03:27:25.747]  All of this indoctrination happening on campuses and I could not freely express my opinion without someone in my class just talking down to me or even the professors.
[03:27:26.167 --> 03:27:43.350]  So the very first thing I did was take a Trump flag out to one of the very many protests that the leftists on Kent State campus did and I just stood there and I stated my voice and I marched with them around campus and then I ended up in student conduct because they wanted to
[03:27:44.310 --> 03:27:49.352]  Expel me for my Trump flag, and that made me mad.
[03:27:49.673 --> 03:27:51.233]  Kaitlin Bennett, you are amazing.
[03:27:51.273 --> 03:27:51.914]  God bless you.
[03:27:51.934 --> 03:27:53.834]  We really, really appreciate you.
[03:27:53.854 --> 03:27:58.156]  The article's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, LibertyHangout.org.
[03:27:58.176 --> 03:27:59.157]  Thanks for joining us tonight.
[03:28:00.967 --> 03:28:01.167]  Thank you.
[03:28:01.187 --> 03:28:04.590]  You know, it's great to have new young firebrands.
[03:28:04.870 --> 03:28:05.830]  Oh, it makes me excited.
[03:28:05.850 --> 03:28:06.991]  Like Caitlyn Bennett coming up.
[03:28:07.071 --> 03:28:08.292]  And you know what the crazy thing, Alex?
[03:28:08.672 --> 03:28:14.256]  Someone like me, and I think Caitlyn is the same way, when I was in college I wasn't necessarily politically inclined.
[03:28:14.497 --> 03:28:19.880]  But then once you get politically inclined and you just have conservative values, you don't think like, oh, this means I'm going to get death threats.
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:20.961]  Oh, people are going to hate me now.
[03:28:21.061 --> 03:28:23.523]  And then you do it and you get it and it's just like, whoa.
[03:28:24.263 --> 03:28:27.466]  But then you know you've got to do it more because they're lying and stealing your identity.
[03:28:27.486 --> 03:28:28.446]  Well, that's how I am.
[03:28:28.506 --> 03:28:29.647]  That just made me fight harder.
[03:28:29.667 --> 03:28:29.847]  I mean.

[03:29:34.755 --> 03:29:36.877]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:29:42.762 --> 03:29:48.204]  Leo Zegami is somebody who has broken hundreds of stories years before they come out.
[03:29:48.344 --> 03:29:55.586]  He's got the exclusive at leozegami.com that Alexander Soros, now taking the mantle over from his father, forms shadow government with Obama.
[03:29:55.706 --> 03:29:58.607]  Leo Zegami, obviously this is critical information.
[03:29:58.667 --> 03:30:01.288]  People need to listen very, very, very carefully.
[03:30:01.508 --> 03:30:16.258]  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee has been shaped by the Soros as a new toy for the political relaunch of Obama and Michelle Obama, so the Obamas.
[03:30:16.558 --> 03:30:19.720]  This motto they have is also quite meaningful.
[03:30:19.780 --> 03:30:22.602]  The political system is rigged.
[03:30:22.642 --> 03:30:23.743]  They have rigged it.
[03:30:24.003 --> 03:30:24.904]  Of course it's rigged.
[03:30:25.344 --> 03:30:26.705]  But by them, not by us.
[03:30:27.285 --> 03:30:31.407]  And instead they are from... But notice that, they're calling themselves the resistance.
[03:30:32.108 --> 03:30:38.471]  Everything we've said, they're now becoming that, then banning me to then step in as the body snatcher into the body.
[03:30:38.751 --> 03:30:40.152]  This is really ridiculous.
[03:30:40.252 --> 03:30:55.039]  I think that people should check out Alexander Soros as the new, really, puppet master of this new world order because he's arriving from an experience as chairman, of course, of the Open Society.
[03:30:55.579 --> 03:30:56.060]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:31:13.197 --> 03:31:15.098]  That we're never going to get rid of Soros.
[03:31:15.479 --> 03:31:30.328]  Father, son, this family is going to continue pushing their New World Order and their democratic, progressive, liberal ways and of course in support of Pope Francis.
[03:31:30.468 --> 03:31:36.352]  The words that were published on Twitter on the 22nd of September by Alexander Soros are very revealing.
[03:31:36.572 --> 03:31:41.756]  He says, it was great to welcome President Barack Obama back into my home.
[03:31:42.620 --> 03:31:47.221]  ...this week and introduce him on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
[03:31:47.801 --> 03:31:49.222]  He says, my home!
[03:31:49.442 --> 03:31:50.282]  So what is his home?
[03:31:50.322 --> 03:31:51.162]  The Democratic Party?
[03:31:51.222 --> 03:31:54.703]  Is the Democratic Party the party of George Soros, Alexander Soros?
[03:31:55.323 --> 03:31:58.124]  Or is the party of the United States of America?
[03:31:58.344 --> 03:32:07.086]  So this is really revealing to the people, once and for all, who is really, who are the puppet masters here, who are pulling the strings.
[03:32:07.446 --> 03:32:12.190]  We got documents earlier this year in January that Alexander Soros was funding.
[03:32:12.210 --> 03:32:13.411]  Anybody can type this in.
[03:32:13.571 --> 03:32:19.836]  Leaked documents show Obama was planning martial law in Maryland in 2015 is the headline.
[03:32:20.197 --> 03:32:22.839]  And it's all their own documents, how they fund Antifa, how they do it.
[03:32:23.219 --> 03:32:27.523]  Antifa is allowed to dox people, threaten to kill people, harass people in restaurants.
[03:32:27.623 --> 03:32:28.563]  Twitter won't take them down.
[03:32:29.064 --> 03:32:32.587]  I confront a CNN reporter who's having me censored, I get banned on Twitter.
[03:32:32.607 --> 03:32:36.450]  So it shows the power of Antifa because Alexander Soros funds it.
[03:32:43.866 --> 03:32:56.490]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:03.072 --> 03:33:09.334]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:10.424 --> 03:33:15.108]  Okay, so let's go to the CNN edited piece where it makes no sense.
[03:33:15.708 --> 03:33:25.196]  They put a similar clip out nationwide of literally from like 10 minutes of the thing mixing things together to make Kanye sound crazy and then we're gonna roll what he actually said.
[03:33:25.216 --> 03:33:26.757]  So let's roll the edited piece.
[03:33:27.838 --> 03:33:31.902]  I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life.
[03:33:32.422 --> 03:33:36.225]  You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends.
[03:33:36.505 --> 03:33:40.108]  But this hat, it gives me, it gives me power in a way.
[03:33:40.448 --> 03:33:47.474]  You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home.
[03:33:47.914 --> 03:33:51.697]  And also, I'm married to a family that, you know,
[03:33:53.438 --> 03:33:55.439]  Not a lot of male energy going on.
[03:33:55.480 --> 03:33:56.480]  It's beautiful, though.
[03:33:56.880 --> 03:34:01.763]  But there's times where, you know, it's something about, you know, I love Hillary.
[03:34:01.963 --> 03:34:03.124]  I love everyone, right?
[03:34:03.484 --> 03:34:13.250]  But the campaign, I'm With Her, just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son.
[03:34:13.731 --> 03:34:17.773]  It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman.
[03:34:18.013 --> 03:34:19.054]  You made a Superman.
[03:34:19.234 --> 03:34:20.715]  That's my favorite superhero.
[03:34:23.317 --> 03:34:40.042]  So they edited it all together so you don't quite get what he's saying, but now he's going to really get to what's being talked about here, about how they want to take chiefs, they want to take role models away from men and women, because they know women, once men are gone, will comply and become
[03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.551]  Under the state.
[03:34:41.911 --> 03:34:45.877]  So let's go ahead now and start the real clip of what Kanye talks about.
[03:34:45.897 --> 03:34:47.919]  Unedited here, 21 minutes long.
[03:34:48.220 --> 03:34:48.640]  Here it is.
[03:34:49.301 --> 03:34:51.104]  And we've made a lot of progress.
[03:34:51.184 --> 03:34:53.046]  Hey look, that's one of many things.
[03:34:53.727 --> 03:34:55.229]  But I appreciate everything with you.
[03:34:55.329 --> 03:34:56.811]  I tell you what, Kim was in.
[03:34:58.075 --> 03:34:59.997]  Mrs. Johnson, we got her out.
[03:35:00.597 --> 03:35:01.978]  She was very unfairly treated.
[03:35:03.099 --> 03:35:04.760]  And there are many other people like that.
[03:35:05.501 --> 03:35:08.704]  We have Larry Hoover's lawyer with us today.
[03:35:08.724 --> 03:35:12.427]  And it's a person that we're focused on.
[03:35:12.967 --> 03:35:16.410]  He has six life sentences and they have him next to the uniform.
[03:35:16.789 --> 03:35:26.755]  By the way, everything Trump's doing is about taking people that are non-violent, whether they be white or black, and getting them out of prison.
[03:35:39.522 --> 03:35:39.942]  How old is he?
[03:35:39.982 --> 03:35:40.182]  How old?
[03:35:40.202 --> 03:35:40.182]  68.
[03:35:40.262 --> 03:35:41.182]  He's 68 years old?
[03:36:00.994 --> 03:36:07.557]  And really the reason why they imprinted him is because he started doing positive for the community.
[03:36:07.717 --> 03:36:13.780]  He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice, that he could wrap people around.
[03:36:13.820 --> 03:36:18.382]  So there's theories that there's infinite amounts of universe and there's alternate universes.
[03:36:18.402 --> 03:36:19.403]  They fear you.
[03:36:19.503 --> 03:36:20.703]  He sold the universe.
[03:36:20.723 --> 03:36:21.344]  This is the key.
[03:36:21.404 --> 03:36:22.764]  He's Tim, the highest level.
[03:36:22.784 --> 03:36:23.164]  I am him.
[03:36:24.725 --> 03:36:30.954]  Each soul's universe, they want you to go with what they're saying instead of being your own individual free will.
[03:36:31.254 --> 03:36:33.056]  He's literally giving you the key.
[03:36:33.417 --> 03:36:34.619]  What Kanye just said is...
[03:36:41.107 --> 03:36:44.248]  You know, people expect that if you're black, you have to be Democrat.
[03:36:44.828 --> 03:36:52.590]  I have conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat.
[03:36:52.610 --> 03:36:56.931]  They say, you know, first of all, it's a limit to the amount of jobs.
[03:36:57.611 --> 03:37:04.053]  So the fathers lose the jobs and they say, we'll give you more money for having more kids in your home.
[03:37:04.273 --> 03:37:08.714]  And then we got rid of the mental health institutions in the 80s and the 90s and the prison rates.
[03:37:09.714 --> 03:37:13.378]  It's so common sense you wonder if people can even comprehend it.
[03:37:24.671 --> 03:37:30.315]  The reason why we need 3 million people on welfare is because we don't have 3 million jobs because we shipped them to China.
[03:37:30.335 --> 03:37:32.917]  You know, you tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends.
[03:37:33.258 --> 03:37:36.840]  But this hat, it gives me power in a way.
[03:37:37.181 --> 03:37:44.266]  You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home.
[03:37:44.646 --> 03:37:48.129]  And also, uh, I'm married to a family that, um,
[03:37:50.170 --> 03:37:52.132]  Not a lot of male energy going on.
[03:37:52.172 --> 03:37:53.193]  It's beautiful, though.
[03:37:53.614 --> 03:37:58.578]  But there's times where, you know, it's something about, you know, I love Hillary.
[03:37:58.718 --> 03:37:59.839]  I love everyone, right?
[03:38:00.240 --> 03:38:09.769]  But the campaign, I'm with her, just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son.
[03:38:09.809 --> 03:38:14.413]  It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman.
[03:38:14.693 --> 03:38:16.034]  You made a Superman.
[03:38:16.054 --> 03:38:17.615]  That's my favorite superhero.
[03:38:17.735 --> 03:38:24.941]  And you made a Superman cape for me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys.
[03:38:25.061 --> 03:38:32.727]  Non-political, no bullsh**, put the beef on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay, and just goes in and gets it done.
[03:38:33.067 --> 03:38:37.831]  Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas, because at Adidas, I went in in 2015 with $14,000.
[03:38:41.013 --> 03:38:42.354]  Oh, he's dumb!
[03:38:42.454 --> 03:38:44.055]  Yeah, because you're dumb!
[03:38:44.115 --> 03:38:45.976]  He's talking fast because he's smart!
[03:38:46.276 --> 03:38:57.164]  You didn't make five billion dollars, you're a... And I went to Casper, we had a meeting in Chicago, and I said, you have to bring manufacturing
[03:38:58.104 --> 03:38:58.764]  Onshore.
[03:38:59.024 --> 03:39:00.065]  Not even shore.
[03:39:00.405 --> 03:39:01.365]  Into the core.
[03:39:01.745 --> 03:39:02.946]  It's not about the borders.
[03:39:03.006 --> 03:39:07.307]  The core of Adidas and Chicago is the core of middle America.
[03:39:07.347 --> 03:39:09.108]  We have to make middle America strong.
[03:39:09.388 --> 03:39:10.788]  So I had the balls.
[03:39:11.028 --> 03:39:12.749]  Because I had enough balls to put on this hat.
[03:39:13.089 --> 03:39:19.393]  I mean, this thing made me a billionaire, and I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal.
[03:39:19.793 --> 03:39:27.918]  But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no home.
[03:39:27.958 --> 03:39:34.122]  And when we do have prison recreation, for no... And he realizes that there's only one man.
[03:39:34.582 --> 03:39:36.024]  And who can help him make that happen?
[03:39:36.164 --> 03:39:37.686]  And that's President Donald Trump.
[03:39:37.846 --> 03:39:43.633]  And he's saying, empower my people, get them out of prison, build factories in the black community, help stop this garbage.
[03:39:43.813 --> 03:39:50.020]  And they say he's a dumb negro because they want to keep everybody poor on that damn plantation.
[03:39:52.603 --> 03:39:53.784]  Trump is loving this.
[03:39:53.804 --> 03:39:56.946]  Immediately when Trump was speechless, it was so dumb.
[03:40:22.863 --> 03:40:25.025]  If you're black, you get three times longer in prison.
[03:40:25.105 --> 03:40:26.647]  I don't support that.
[03:40:26.687 --> 03:40:28.228]  Go Biden and Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:28.348 --> 03:40:29.349]  Rope the legislation!
[03:40:47.745 --> 03:40:49.266]  We don't have 13 floors, do we?
[03:40:49.747 --> 03:40:55.913]  You know, so the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn't look like the people they were amending.
[03:40:56.293 --> 03:41:03.740]  Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read, or African Americans to read.
[03:41:05.862 --> 03:41:09.225]  And so that meant if you actually read the amendment, you'd get locked up!
[03:41:09.545 --> 03:41:11.146]  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
[03:41:11.166 --> 03:41:17.251]  I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL and he looked at my brain.
[03:41:17.271 --> 03:41:18.892]  It's equal on three parts.
[03:41:19.072 --> 03:41:20.253]  I'm gonna go ahead and
[03:41:30.840 --> 03:41:31.880]  Yeah, Kanye West is a genius.
[03:41:31.900 --> 03:41:34.522]  And the blacks are calling him a retard because he's a genius.
[03:41:34.562 --> 03:41:35.402]  No, get on the plantation, Kanye.
[03:41:56.690 --> 03:41:57.951]  Put your shackles on, Kanye.
[03:41:57.971 --> 03:41:58.832]  He's exhausted.
[03:41:58.852 --> 03:42:00.113]  He's supporting Trump.
[03:42:00.133 --> 03:42:02.195]  They grabbed him and thrown him in the hospital.
[03:42:02.355 --> 03:42:03.636]  All these parasites that live off him.
[03:42:03.676 --> 03:42:04.357]  They all live off him.
[03:42:17.068 --> 03:42:18.688]  So we can empower pharmaceuticals?
[03:42:18.728 --> 03:42:19.249]  Exactly!
[03:42:19.509 --> 03:42:21.609]  He's saying, listen, I'm the leader!
[03:42:21.789 --> 03:42:22.409]  I build it!
[03:42:22.489 --> 03:42:22.869]  I build it!
[03:42:22.889 --> 03:42:23.150]  I build it!
[03:42:23.190 --> 03:42:23.570]  The tree's free!
[03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:24.470]  I'm building it, bitch!
[03:42:24.530 --> 03:42:24.950]  Yeah, Foxconn!
[03:42:24.990 --> 03:42:26.050]  This is like a conference!
[03:42:26.090 --> 03:42:27.771]  No, bring them here and make them good!
[03:42:27.791 --> 03:42:28.331]  They're $1,000 in China!
[03:42:28.351 --> 03:42:29.071]  Dude, he's kidding him!
[03:42:46.064 --> 03:42:46.645]  Did you hear?
[03:42:47.045 --> 03:42:48.987]  Christmas is coming in October!
[03:42:49.027 --> 03:42:50.508]  Black Friday's coming in October!
[03:42:51.048 --> 03:42:52.630]  Cyber Monday's coming in October!
[03:42:52.650 --> 03:42:59.496]  But what's really coming in October is incredible deals, 50% off at mfulwarrestore.com and free shipping.
[03:43:00.236 --> 03:43:07.342]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down mfulwars.com and to shut down your voice.
[03:43:08.063 --> 03:43:12.827]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want Mfulwars to go the way of the Dodo Bird.
[03:43:13.936 --> 03:43:14.857]  For the way of the dinosaurs.
[03:43:15.117 --> 03:43:17.418]  Because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[03:43:18.699 --> 03:43:22.362]  You've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us.
[03:43:22.382 --> 03:43:28.426]  And you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away so we can't even process orders.
[03:43:29.107 --> 03:43:33.870]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel mafia operation.
[03:43:33.930 --> 03:43:39.014]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[03:43:40.675 --> 03:43:54.020]  Now we have major stockpiles of incredibly high quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and of course for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[03:43:54.600 --> 03:43:58.702]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[03:43:59.922 --> 03:44:05.325]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[03:44:05.685 --> 03:44:07.626]  Black Friday's coming early.
[03:44:07.666 --> 03:44:08.866]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[03:44:08.986 --> 03:44:14.969]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[03:44:15.549 --> 03:44:20.912]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[03:44:21.894 --> 03:44:29.463]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[03:44:30.164 --> 03:44:32.246]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[03:44:33.490 --> 03:44:43.478]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[03:44:43.899 --> 03:44:48.563]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[03:44:49.103 --> 03:44:52.266]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[03:44:52.886 --> 03:44:57.851]  And so now they're coming after our ability, InfoWarsTore.com, to even have credit card processing.
[03:44:57.891 --> 03:45:01.153]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[03:45:02.154 --> 03:45:02.854]  Get your X2.
[03:45:03.154 --> 03:45:06.336]  Even though it's selling out in the last run, 50% off.
[03:45:06.716 --> 03:45:07.956]  Rainforest, selling out, 50% off.
[03:45:07.976 --> 03:45:10.417]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[03:45:11.097 --> 03:45:12.718]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[03:45:12.758 --> 03:45:15.119]  Now, I do that with air filtration, water filtration.
[03:45:15.479 --> 03:45:19.360]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[03:45:19.380 --> 03:45:23.382]  And free shipping, store-wide, info-more-store.com.
[03:45:23.662 --> 03:45:26.183]  So, this is the October
[03:45:27.739 --> 03:45:29.160]  Black Friday coming early.
[03:45:29.560 --> 03:45:30.721]  This is Christmas coming early.
[03:45:31.121 --> 03:45:32.642]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.
[03:45:32.802 --> 03:45:34.823]  This is Christmas in October.
[03:45:35.423 --> 03:45:38.485]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great.
[03:45:38.585 --> 03:45:39.425]  The five-star ratings.
[03:45:39.945 --> 03:45:41.426]  And go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts.
[03:45:42.127 --> 03:45:42.987]  So that you have them.
[03:45:43.127 --> 03:45:44.388]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[03:45:44.408 --> 03:45:45.628]  Christmas is only two months away.
[03:45:46.409 --> 03:45:49.030]  And you can support the M4 War while getting great products and win-win.
[03:45:49.290 --> 03:45:50.091]  I'm counting on you.
[03:45:50.131 --> 03:45:51.071]  You've always come through.
[03:45:51.091 --> 03:45:52.672]  They know you always come through.
[03:45:52.972 --> 03:45:55.974]  Which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[03:45:56.634 --> 03:46:01.359]  With a five-star-rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[03:46:01.379 --> 03:46:04.281]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[03:46:04.342 --> 03:46:05.082]  Nobody's got that.
[03:46:05.783 --> 03:46:06.664]  Credit card processing.
[03:46:07.084 --> 03:46:09.106]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[03:46:09.386 --> 03:46:09.967]  We expose them.
[03:46:10.147 --> 03:46:14.091]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.
[03:46:15.834 --> 03:46:21.199]  We're in some serious times because we've been effective, we've been strong, we've been forceful, we've been successful.
[03:46:21.219 --> 03:46:23.021]  You've been successful by supporting us.
[03:46:23.061 --> 03:46:30.908]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, today, in this mega sale, 50% off free shipping, to help bring the InfoWar to the next level.
[03:46:31.148 --> 03:46:32.029]  I'm counting on you.
[03:46:32.309 --> 03:46:33.210]  You always come through.
[03:46:33.550 --> 03:46:34.311]  Take advantage of this.
[03:46:34.331 --> 03:46:36.473]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[03:46:44.788 --> 03:46:47.399]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:02.139 --> 03:47:04.681]  If he don't look good, we don't look good.
[03:47:04.741 --> 03:47:07.183]  Kanye is on fire for humanity.
[03:47:07.684 --> 03:47:09.005]  This is the renaissance.
[03:47:09.045 --> 03:47:12.948]  The flyers, the flyer planes, the best factories.
[03:47:13.008 --> 03:47:19.614]  And the guy that wanted to block the mall, he said, I don't like the renaissance.
[03:47:19.674 --> 03:47:21.055]  They don't like this.
[03:47:21.075 --> 03:47:23.718]  Do you think they like seeing this right here?
[03:47:23.798 --> 03:47:25.679]  All I do is feel good seeing this.
[03:47:26.500 --> 03:47:30.502]  Yeah, we're putting people in positions that have to do illegal things.
[03:47:30.522 --> 03:47:34.083]  It ends up in the cheapest factory ever, the prison system.
[03:47:35.484 --> 03:47:38.125]  I'll tell you what, that was pretty impressive, folks.
[03:47:39.286 --> 03:47:43.208]  You know, I hate to say this, Jim, you want to say something?
[03:47:43.248 --> 03:47:44.648]  Yeah, exactly, how do you follow that?
[03:47:45.028 --> 03:47:49.350]  And they said Trump didn't like it, and then Trump was blown away.
[03:47:50.151 --> 03:47:52.272]  If he doesn't look good, we don't look good.
[03:47:53.746 --> 03:47:55.548]  And see, Jim Brown and Trump are synced.
[03:47:55.608 --> 03:47:56.630]  They've been friends for 30 years.
[03:47:57.390 --> 03:47:58.272]  They're synced up.
[03:47:58.312 --> 03:48:00.154]  Jim Brown is a badass.
[03:48:00.194 --> 03:48:02.056]  Jim Brown knows Trump well, loves everybody.
[03:48:10.347 --> 03:48:13.589]  You think Jim Brown's gonna be intimidated?
[03:48:13.609 --> 03:48:16.951]  The guy used to run over people on a, like, literally run them over.
[03:48:17.151 --> 03:48:18.172]  That was quite something.
[03:48:18.472 --> 03:48:20.113]  That guy's not intimidated by anything.
[03:48:20.434 --> 03:48:22.155]  So, he just said that.
[03:48:22.215 --> 03:48:24.076]  Can I just ask a quick question?
[03:48:24.096 --> 03:48:30.300]  When he dies, he's the person, when Robert Bowman's body broken, realize that this is where God is.
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:31.701]  It's coming together.
[03:48:31.761 --> 03:48:33.262]  And they're not gonna stand in the way of this.
[03:48:33.422 --> 03:48:34.503]  And that's why they hate us.
[03:48:35.367 --> 03:48:37.488]  That's why they say this is satanic.
[03:48:37.688 --> 03:48:39.690]  This means interdimensional victory.
[03:48:40.290 --> 03:48:45.273]  This is the symbol of the future.
[03:48:45.293 --> 03:48:47.494]  This doesn't mean white power.
[03:48:47.754 --> 03:48:49.615]  This means infinity.
[03:48:50.296 --> 03:48:52.477]  This literally means okay in sign language.
[03:48:52.497 --> 03:48:55.019]  The real, they see, symbol of the future.
[03:48:55.839 --> 03:49:01.163]  We really get caught up in the idea of racism, or the idea of industry.
[03:49:01.203 --> 03:49:04.606]  People don't have land, they settle grass.
[03:49:04.946 --> 03:49:06.748]  We're together, everything's okay.
[03:49:07.068 --> 03:49:10.171]  Don't matter if mama died last week, she's in heaven.
[03:49:10.231 --> 03:49:11.432]  We're in an infinity.
[03:49:11.452 --> 03:49:17.536]  We want land because we got to know how it feels to actually have our own land and have ownership of our own blocks.
[03:49:17.877 --> 03:49:20.839]  So when you don't have ownership, then it's all about how something looks.
[03:49:20.859 --> 03:49:21.339]  Same deal.
[03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:22.280]  Make you wealthy.
[03:49:22.360 --> 03:49:23.061]  Own your own city.
[03:49:23.101 --> 03:49:24.242]  Be successful.
[03:49:25.303 --> 03:49:25.883]  Boom.
[03:49:25.923 --> 03:49:36.331]  And the amazing thing he said there was he's saying that people buy into the propaganda of making sure they have the coolest brand, like Nike, instead of, you know, I'm going to invest in myself and buy a home and buy land.
[03:49:36.591 --> 03:49:39.813]  No, I'm going to invest in a brand so I can be cool and accepted.
[03:49:39.953 --> 03:49:43.956]  And the whole horror media says Kanye's crazy.
[03:49:43.996 --> 03:49:44.917]  None of it makes sense.
[03:49:44.977 --> 03:49:48.320]  He made billions on his own, and he's an idiot.
[03:49:48.380 --> 03:49:53.664]  But Don Lemon that can't even wipe his own ass, he's a genius, calling black people that are successful
[03:49:54.144 --> 03:49:54.524]  Dumb Negroes.
[03:49:54.544 --> 03:49:55.064]  Let's finish up.
[03:49:55.084 --> 03:49:55.284]  Exactly.
[03:49:55.304 --> 03:49:56.205]  It's us saying bad cops, sir.
[03:49:56.245 --> 03:49:57.345]  We need to stop killing each other.
[03:49:57.365 --> 03:50:00.366]  He's trying to fix things.
[03:50:00.606 --> 03:50:02.386]  Dude, turn these dollars into dollars.
[03:50:16.590 --> 03:50:24.193]  So a lot of times the police officer is sitting there, they're being forced to do this and forced to do that block, and then they force somebody into something and force something.
[03:50:24.393 --> 03:50:30.576]  We have to release the love throughout the entire country and give opportunity.
[03:50:30.676 --> 03:50:36.379]  A lot of times it's just the overall lack of reparations that we get at any given point.
[03:50:37.179 --> 03:50:39.699]  Oh, this is racist, this is racist, this is racist, this is racist.
[03:50:39.979 --> 03:50:42.480]  So we don't have a reparation, but we have the 13th Amendment.
[03:50:42.520 --> 03:50:45.100]  We gotta open up the whole conversation.
[03:50:45.440 --> 03:50:49.221]  So, and that's a move, one of the moves that I love that liberals try to do.
[03:50:50.381 --> 03:50:56.722]  The liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism because they know that we are very proud emotional people.
[03:50:57.002 --> 03:51:01.263]  So when I said I like Trump to like someone that's liberal, they'll say, oh, but he's racist.
[03:51:01.503 --> 03:51:03.403]  You think racism can control me?
[03:51:03.423 --> 03:51:04.584]  You know, all I'm doing is arrogance.
[03:51:04.604 --> 03:51:06.444]  Oh, that don't stop me, that's an invisible wall.
[03:51:06.544 --> 03:51:08.085]  They almost came to the studio.
[03:51:08.165 --> 03:51:10.605]  It'd be the next, you know, Rogan podcast, et cetera.
[03:51:10.626 --> 03:51:11.366]  I'm gonna call in Farrakhan.
[03:51:11.386 --> 03:51:12.046]  I'll try to get this on.
[03:51:12.086 --> 03:51:13.467]  Imagine Alex Jones, Farrakhan, and Kanye West.
[03:51:30.973 --> 03:51:31.313]  I think so.
[03:51:52.623 --> 03:51:54.764]  Don't do it for me on that show.
[03:51:54.804 --> 03:51:57.245]  I would back tax breaks for black people.
[03:52:16.732 --> 03:52:18.233]  You go out and do a business.
[03:52:18.253 --> 03:52:21.075]  It's not like, oh, you get some money because you're black or whatever.
[03:52:21.415 --> 03:52:22.816]  No, no, no, no.
[03:52:22.916 --> 03:52:24.357]  Because things were done wrong.
[03:52:24.377 --> 03:52:25.718]  Talk about reparations.
[03:52:25.758 --> 03:52:30.981]  How about... A, a, a, a... What's the Jewish term?
[03:52:31.001 --> 03:52:32.202]  They forgive taxes every decade.
[03:52:32.242 --> 03:52:33.063]  I can't think of it.
[03:52:33.123 --> 03:52:35.304]  I know you're talking about it.
[03:52:35.644 --> 03:52:36.685]  I'll pop my head out of it.
[03:52:36.705 --> 03:52:37.806]  Guys, Google or search Google.com.
[03:52:37.826 --> 03:52:38.106]  Google it.
[03:52:38.146 --> 03:52:38.586]  Go, go, go.
[03:52:38.606 --> 03:52:39.226]  What is the Jewish...
[03:52:46.351 --> 03:52:55.903]  Which would be a mix of education that empowers people and gives them modern information like, sometimes people say, this kid has ADD, this kid has ADD.
[03:52:55.943 --> 03:52:58.347]  You don't have ADD, school is boring.
[03:52:58.527 --> 03:53:00.249]  It was boring, it's not as exciting as this.
[03:53:00.569 --> 03:53:02.412]  We have to make it more exciting with curriculum.
[03:53:03.433 --> 03:53:05.895]  You play basketball while you're doing math.
[03:53:06.055 --> 03:53:08.756]  You learn about music while you meditate in the morning.
[03:53:08.916 --> 03:53:16.081]  We have to instate mental health and art programs back into the city.
[03:53:16.841 --> 03:53:22.364]  And also, Larry Hoover is an example of a man that was turning his life around.
[03:53:22.445 --> 03:53:27.227]  As soon as he tried to turn his life around, they hit him with six life sentences.
[03:53:27.788 --> 03:53:29.089]  You say don't tear down the statue.
[03:53:29.109 --> 03:53:31.350]  Larry Hoover is a living statue.
[03:53:31.550 --> 03:53:33.110]  He's a beacon for us.
[03:53:33.230 --> 03:53:34.631]  I think it's the year of jubilee.
[03:53:34.671 --> 03:53:38.592]  Jubilee, jubilee, jubilee, jubilee, jubilee, jubilee, jubilee.
[03:53:38.932 --> 03:53:44.754]  I would a million percent say half-white.
[03:53:44.794 --> 03:53:51.716]  Let's get blacks 10 years of tax exemption.
[03:53:51.796 --> 03:53:56.237]  Everybody would invest in those companies so they'd be tax exempt.
[03:53:56.257 --> 03:53:57.998]  The richest people in America would be black.
[03:53:58.358 --> 03:53:58.878]  I'm ready!
[03:53:59.678 --> 03:54:02.940]  You've already given the globalists and the big banks tax exemption.
[03:54:03.320 --> 03:54:04.540]  Give it to black people.
[03:54:04.740 --> 03:54:06.741]  I want reparations right now.
[03:54:07.141 --> 03:54:07.862]  I want a bill.
[03:54:07.882 --> 03:54:13.824]  Ten years, black people, if you're 10% African, you don't pay taxes.
[03:54:14.165 --> 03:54:15.245]  Put that up your ass now!
[03:54:15.265 --> 03:54:16.946]  Democrats, excuse me.
[03:54:17.326 --> 03:54:18.427]  I'm serious!
[03:54:18.647 --> 03:54:21.168]  And then you imagine all of what happens?
[03:54:21.248 --> 03:54:25.910]  It's not about Democrats handing out, oh we'll get the taxes and give you a little bit of money.
[03:54:25.930 --> 03:54:26.911]  They're going to keep the money.
[03:54:27.151 --> 03:54:27.571]  No!
[03:54:27.791 --> 03:54:28.192]  Okay.
[03:54:28.492 --> 03:54:29.332]  You're African.
[03:54:29.372 --> 03:54:30.773]  You've been here for a couple generations.
[03:54:30.873 --> 03:54:34.875]  Doesn't matter if you just got here this year on an H1N1 visa from Nigeria.
[03:54:35.255 --> 03:54:36.256]  But you've lived here.
[03:54:36.336 --> 03:54:37.436]  You can prove your family.
[03:54:37.456 --> 03:54:38.477]  We're slaves.
[03:54:38.877 --> 03:54:42.399]  You get 10 years, forget it, 40 acres and a mule.
[03:54:42.479 --> 03:54:43.680]  I believe in this now.
[03:54:43.780 --> 03:54:44.280]  Oh my God.
[03:54:44.680 --> 03:54:47.103]  You get 10 years of tax exemption.
[03:54:47.263 --> 03:54:51.228]  Everyone would invest in a company that black people own.
[03:54:51.268 --> 03:54:53.951]  Because just 40% over and over again.
[03:54:53.991 --> 03:54:56.835]  I would love to see rich black people everywhere.
[03:54:57.155 --> 03:55:01.821]  I'd love to go into a steakhouse and half of the people are black eating big old juicy steaks.
[03:55:02.962 --> 03:55:05.763]  God, oh my, that is an amazing run-up.
[03:55:05.783 --> 03:55:08.185]  Let me tell you, I'm going to make someone talk shit.
[03:55:08.545 --> 03:55:11.026]  I'm going to say, sir, they want reparations.
[03:55:11.326 --> 03:55:13.427]  The left wants to tell blacks to get the free deal.
[03:55:13.447 --> 03:55:15.508]  They'll never give it to them.
[03:55:15.528 --> 03:55:21.691]  If someone is at least half African and can prove they've been here for over 150 years for answers, or 170 years.
[03:55:21.731 --> 03:55:22.352]  Actually, forget it.
[03:55:22.432 --> 03:55:26.053]  If you have African blood and have been a citizen, tax exemption 10 years.
[03:55:31.656 --> 03:55:32.477]  Oh my God.
[03:55:32.497 --> 03:55:35.579]  Can you imagine what they're going to do?
[03:55:35.819 --> 03:55:38.320]  Well, I can see the Democrats' reaction.
[03:55:38.740 --> 03:55:40.922]  No, I'm now for reparations.
[03:55:40.982 --> 03:55:43.603]  I know about taxes being cut, except by exploding.
[03:55:43.904 --> 03:55:48.647]  No, but see, I'm going to be hiring all these black folks to have them run the company so I get the tax exemption.
[03:55:49.207 --> 03:55:51.248]  No, they get it too, but I get it too.
[03:55:51.688 --> 03:55:52.429]  No, I'm serious.
[03:55:52.469 --> 03:55:54.150]  I just had a genius moment right there.
[03:55:54.390 --> 03:55:55.070]  Owen, I'm not kidding.
[03:55:55.090 --> 03:55:55.751]  No, I get it.
[03:55:55.891 --> 03:55:56.351]  I see it.
[03:55:56.411 --> 03:55:58.773]  No, but hearing Kanye, it's just brainstorming going.
[03:55:58.953 --> 03:55:59.653]  Listen to him.
[03:56:00.934 --> 03:56:07.339]  We can benefit on this side, and we can learn how to be malleable in the infinite universe that we are, and the loving beings that we are.
[03:56:07.359 --> 03:56:07.659]  Exactly!
[03:56:08.139 --> 03:56:10.541]  And then, 13% of the population is black?
[03:56:10.561 --> 03:56:12.322]  Make them tax exempt?
[03:56:12.362 --> 03:56:13.383]  That'll raise the whole country!
[03:56:13.403 --> 03:56:14.264]  We are one country.
[03:56:14.284 --> 03:56:15.145]  I want reparations.
[03:56:15.185 --> 03:56:17.046]  We are one moment in history and time.
[03:56:17.066 --> 03:56:18.227]  Oh, this is our movement?
[03:56:18.287 --> 03:56:19.388]  I'm not kidding.
[03:56:19.448 --> 03:56:23.551]  Anybody that's been here, and the crew they've even had, their family, their citizens.
[03:56:23.831 --> 03:56:28.654]  If you're African descent, you get 10 years tax exemption.
[03:56:28.735 --> 03:56:29.715]  You're in the Oval Office.
[03:56:32.277 --> 03:56:34.339]  Oh, it is good energy in this.
[03:56:34.399 --> 03:56:35.179]  Isn't it good energy?
[03:56:35.599 --> 03:56:36.220]  It's good energy.
[03:56:36.280 --> 03:56:37.381]  It's a great place, Jim.
[03:56:37.741 --> 03:56:38.862]  See, that's all Trump talks about.
[03:56:38.882 --> 03:56:41.424]  That's all he talks about is energy.
[03:56:41.444 --> 03:56:42.024]  Thank you, too.
[03:56:42.765 --> 03:56:43.805]  You're so respected.
[03:56:44.486 --> 03:56:45.647]  And what Kanye's doing.
[03:56:45.687 --> 03:56:47.008]  All right, folks, we're out of time.
[03:56:47.088 --> 03:56:47.668]  All over the world.
[03:56:47.708 --> 03:56:49.489]  I'll cover this all tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:56:49.690 --> 03:56:50.930]  David, I'll cover it before that.
[03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:51.591]  Owen at 3.
[03:56:53.372 --> 03:56:54.973]  Actually, I just had the epiphany.
[03:56:55.514 --> 03:56:56.975]  I'm calling for reparations right now.
[03:56:57.932 --> 03:56:58.652]  Cut the taxes.
[03:56:59.513 --> 03:57:01.974]  I think black Americans should have 10 years of no taxes.
[03:57:02.054 --> 03:57:02.654]  Quit, quit.
[03:57:02.674 --> 03:57:03.635]  I'm not just saying that.
[03:57:03.755 --> 03:57:04.355]  I mean that.
[03:57:04.415 --> 03:57:05.716]  This is, it's true.
[03:57:05.876 --> 03:57:06.977]  I'm now for reparations.
[03:57:07.797 --> 03:57:08.438]  I'm serious.
[03:57:09.118 --> 03:57:12.460]  We're going to launch anyone of African descent that's a citizen.
[03:57:12.480 --> 03:57:13.560]  Oh my God.
[03:57:13.700 --> 03:57:20.764]  This is going to, I'm going to tell you, this is going to change the whole world, Ellen.
[03:57:21.024 --> 03:57:21.564]  God bless you.
[03:57:21.664 --> 03:57:23.545]  I'm so proud of this.
[03:57:23.625 --> 03:57:24.986]  Anybody that's black and American.
[03:57:25.066 --> 03:57:25.626]  Good energy.
[03:57:25.666 --> 03:57:26.407]  Good energy.
[03:57:30.407 --> 03:57:34.111]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[03:57:34.392 --> 03:57:37.836]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[03:57:38.177 --> 03:57:47.710]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[03:57:48.210 --> 03:57:48.611]  Study.
[03:57:48.891 --> 03:57:51.633]  This formula is 24 ppm.
[03:57:51.994 --> 03:57:53.775]  That's 32 ppm version.
[03:57:54.076 --> 03:57:56.958]  This FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[03:57:57.019 --> 03:57:59.381]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[03:57:59.661 --> 03:58:04.325]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[03:58:04.345 --> 03:58:04.886]  Ah, you don't want that.
[03:58:05.226 --> 03:58:06.887]  What are champions made of?
[03:58:35.296 --> 03:58:36.497]  Here's a man who can show you.
[03:58:37.037 --> 03:58:44.883]  AAA-253-3139 AAA-253-3139 AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:58:44.903 --> 03:58:47.164]  AAA-253-3139 AAA-253-3139 AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:58:47.184 --> 03:58:49.026]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
