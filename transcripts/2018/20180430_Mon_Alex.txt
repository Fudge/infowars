[00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:10.011]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:19.594]  One thing, we're not playing games, and... I remember, you know, it was very rough three, four months ago.
[00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.525]  That's very nice, thank you.
[00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:43.386]  That's very nice.
[00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:45.507]  Nobel.
[00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:50.228]  I just want to get the job done.
[00:00:50.689 --> 00:01:09.335]  So, if we would have... Last night, I pointed out that President Trump should be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.252]  And what is the nomination process?
[00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:17.415]  Well, you have the Nobel Committee, and members of that can recommend someone for it.
[00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:23.459]  It's one of the most prestigious prizes out there, but it's become very, very, not just worthless, but really, I think, a negative prize.
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:39.709]  When they gave Al Gore a prize, and they gave Barack Obama a prize when he was just president-elect, and then launched record numbers of wars, if they would have revoked those prizes, then I would say it had some value back when they were giving it to Alexander Shultz and Nielsen.
[00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:42.716]  And people like Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:44.117]  Dr. Martin Luther King.
[00:01:44.858 --> 00:02:00.447]  But now it is a badge of infamy and corruption and the Nobel Prize for Mr. Nobel of Sweden, inventor of dynamite, has now become a cruel joke.
[00:02:01.127 --> 00:02:03.089]  Maybe it was always a cruel joke.
[00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.730]  But now,
[00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:17.613]  Hours after I pointed out, and I think everybody else could see the prima facie evidence of it, the South Korean president calls for Trump to get the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on North Korea.
[00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:26.161]  North and South have agreed to end the war officially in the next few weeks and to denuclearize and to begin a 10-year process.
[00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:31.365]  That means within 10 years they will begin the process of officially merging.
[00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:36.488]  But ahead of that, economic, military, diplomatic, cultural exchange.
[00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.729]  Wow!
[00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.551]  Talk about getting the communist boot off of the neck of North Korea.
[00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:43.792]  This is a great start.
[00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:52.409]  And it's all because the strategy of global tension, the strategy of using North Korea as a detonator, is ending because Trump is saying no.
[00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.591]  Now the globalists are trying to sabotage it, they're trying to poo-poo it.
[00:02:55.611 --> 00:03:00.634]  Remember they said Trump was going to kill us all for his policies actually bringing pressure on the North.
[00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:10.200]  The North had been coddled and propped up and given the fissile material, the reactors, and of course the delivery systems from the boost, start boost,
[00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:16.785]  The final boost to re-entry to multiple warhead delivery systems.
[00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:25.312]  Everything had been given to them by the Clintonistas for global destabilization and the continued sellout of this nation.
[00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:30.516]  Well, just like a record skipping or two cars crashing.
[00:03:31.036 --> 00:03:39.543]  You ever been sitting out on the patio having lunch, you hear a car wreck even a half mile away and you're... You go, wow, that sounds bad.
[00:03:40.592 --> 00:04:01.883]  Well, that's the record skipping of the car crashing as the globalist policy goes down in flames, and Clapper, and Brennan, and Obama, and Hillary, and all the globalists talk about how stupid Trump is, and Paul Krugman, you'll never bring the economy back, you'll never hit 3% growth rate, and they were there bad-mouthing it all because they've been oppressing it.
[00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:06.306]  They've been driving it down.
[00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:16.322]  They've been strangling the country to consolidate power with other team leaders like Jeff Bezos and all the other usual followers.
[00:04:16.342 --> 00:04:21.365]  But you're going to watch more and more the British Royal, the Rockefeller-Rothschild plan.
[00:04:22.568 --> 00:04:38.551]  Then we're gonna watch the wheels come off of it because it's authoritarian, and because you and I and many others have been exposing it as an unelected, corporate, private, world government, above the law, tax-exempt, diplomatic community that wants us to be poor as a system of neo-feudalism.
[00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:39.351]  Serfdom.
[00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:40.891]  And guess what?
[00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:48.713]  It sucks, it's unpopular, it's draconian, and it only takes us to the depopulation eugenics end.
[00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:51.073]  So we want the Buck Rogers future,
[00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:54.753]  We want the Buck Rogers 21st Century version.
[00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:59.636]  We don't want your eugenics, uh, creepazoid, control freak, eugenics version.
[00:04:59.676 --> 00:05:00.937]  So get ready for the big battle.
[00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:07.362]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[00:05:07.662 --> 00:05:08.963]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:10.704]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[00:05:10.965 --> 00:05:13.366]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:14.347]  We've beaten six.
[00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.589]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.010]  You're my soldier.
[00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.790]  We're all in this together.
[00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.516]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:25.937]  So I salute you and I thank you.

[00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.032]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:09.653]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:55.787]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, the 30th day, hard to believe of April 2018, and the President of South Korea has publicly nominated President Donald J. Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work, seminal, critical, central work, bringing peace to the peninsula.
[00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:03.563]  As Scott Adams said on the show Friday, there's wanting to do something and there's deciding to do it.
[00:07:04.043 --> 00:07:17.547]  And Kim Jong-un has decided to go with a reunification plan to give up the nuclear weapons and to basically phase out the North Korean dictatorship and to begin a 10-year unification plan.
[00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:35.560]  Now again, this is a very public nomination by a president of the most prosperous per capita country in the world, South Korea, juxtaposed in a perfect example of free market capitalism and the human spirit versus communism that murders and enslaves the human spirit.
[00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:38.963]  And liberal heads are already exploding.
[00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:42.505]  It was the Clintons that kept that 60-year war going.
[00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:50.189]  It was the Clintons that transferred the uranium and the reactors and the delivery systems.
[00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:56.791]  And now the heads are already exploding because the economy's coming back, political correctness is being crushed.
[00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:01.852]  We're starting to see new jobs come back to the country.
[00:08:01.932 --> 00:08:13.395]  So many positive things are happening because the globalists were on purpose creating a strategy of crisis in the world so that they would have more control over humanity.
[00:08:14.906 --> 00:08:20.629]  But now all of that is coming to a huge end.
[00:08:21.349 --> 00:08:22.910]  But we're not there yet.
[00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.930]  We're not to the finish line yet.
[00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:27.532]  The globalists are going to try to stage false flags on the peninsula.
[00:08:28.673 --> 00:08:34.096]  They're going to try to stage terror attacks here in the US and Europe, to also blame Syria.
[00:08:34.536 --> 00:08:36.757]  They're going to launch more fake chemical attacks.
[00:08:36.797 --> 00:08:42.500]  By the way, last week, German TV, British TV, Russian TV, French TV, all independent,
[00:08:43.365 --> 00:08:54.014]  Germany's biggest public television program went to Syria, interviewed more than 15 kids who were on television dying of being nerve gassed.
[00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:55.475]  The very children.
[00:08:56.576 --> 00:09:01.700]  And they said, we were taken, water was doused on us, we were told to say we were sick for free food.
[00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:03.502]  By the White Helmets.
[00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:07.745]  That are the ISIS organization, their PR group.
[00:09:11.181 --> 00:09:31.056]  So we saw all of that taking place, and now it's all over the news, it's confirmed, now they've flown the kids to Germany, to France, and to Russia, and the children are on national news saying, we were told to say we were hit by chemicals.
[00:09:31.076 --> 00:09:34.639]  And then they have the video of the very children they said were dying.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.662]  It is unbelievable.
[00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:42.731]  And it's even breaking out on Al Jazeera.
[00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.773]  The very children are in press conferences.
[00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:46.514]  There's one on screen.
[00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:47.114]  There's video of this.
[00:09:47.154 --> 00:09:48.215]  I'm going to cover it more later.
[00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:49.276]  It is unbelievable.
[00:09:49.897 --> 00:09:56.642]  Who were shown as basically dead with green paint on their faces, claiming they died of nerve gas.
[00:09:58.063 --> 00:10:00.966]  And they're all testifying to it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:01.606 --> 00:10:06.690]  So the establishment does not know what to do right now.
[00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:08.472]  Well, I'm here to tell you.
[00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:12.690]  They are going to launch more of these.
[00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.811]  Yes, there he is, supposedly nerve-gassed, and then there he is on Al Jazeera, not being nerve-gassed.
[00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:21.652]  And they've got 15 of these children have been flown.
[00:10:22.232 --> 00:10:24.253]  They're all over national television in Europe.
[00:10:24.673 --> 00:10:26.913]  To the credit of the Germans, they're not suicidal.
[00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:30.574]  Their president said, we're not involved in this cover-up.
[00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.915]  Not Merkel, their chancellor, their president.
[00:10:33.495 --> 00:10:36.256]  They have an upper and lower house of their Reichstag.
[00:10:39.002 --> 00:10:40.062]  And it's just incredible.
[00:10:40.082 --> 00:10:49.124]  Yeah, the London Independent had this on April 17th, 13 days ago, award-winning journalist Robert Fisch, but now it's confirmed in triplicate.
[00:10:49.664 --> 00:10:54.985]  The search for truth in the rubble of Douma and one doctor doubts over chemical attacks.
[00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:57.005]  Well, that was 13 days ago.
[00:10:57.065 --> 00:11:01.626]  Now it's all confirmed and zero coverage here in the United States.
[00:11:03.987 --> 00:11:05.067]  Except for this broadcast.
[00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:08.392]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:08.993 --> 00:11:10.093]  Tucker Carlson was right.
[00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:10.654]  We were right.
[00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:11.274]  We were all right.
[00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:12.335]  Yeah, who had the motive?
[00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:17.019]  ISIS had been defeated, except for being in Douma, their last city.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.041]  The Russians are pulling out.
[00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:20.521]  The U.S.
[00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:21.122]  is pulling out.
[00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:22.082]  We've declared victory.
[00:11:23.223 --> 00:11:23.884]  ISIS wants to
[00:11:25.174 --> 00:11:27.015]  Snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:11:27.115 --> 00:11:38.363]  So magically, there's a fourth chemical attack that they blamed on the Syrians, when they've been caught in 52 chemical attacks ISIS has, according to the New York Times, in the seven-year war.
[00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:41.825]  They've been caught 50-plus times.
[00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:43.867]  Red-handed.
[00:11:45.067 --> 00:11:47.229]  Even the New York Times admits that, in a rare moment of truth.
[00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:53.415]  And then now the Rebels have been caught three separate times staging them.
[00:11:53.735 --> 00:11:54.975]  This is the fourth time.
[00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:57.356]  Yeah, look at this fake footage of your TV viewer.
[00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:58.637]  The fake Dr. Winks.
[00:12:00.117 --> 00:12:01.298]  Let's them know I'm about to fall over.
[00:12:01.378 --> 00:12:02.698]  He falls over between the kids.
[00:12:03.278 --> 00:12:04.279]  Cameras all zoom in.
[00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:08.060]  You see the one kid who's been crying, starts laughing, stops shaking.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.683]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the type of acting you would see in a third grader play.
[00:12:20.014 --> 00:12:23.278]  I went and saw my 10-year-old daughter in a play this weekend.
[00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:27.682]  She did a great job in one of the lead roles, but the point was it was still acting.
[00:12:28.203 --> 00:12:32.608]  And it was 10 times better than the acting we just saw over there.
[00:12:32.848 --> 00:12:34.490]  Does that mean chemical attacks don't happen?
[00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.974]  No, we just said 50-plus launched by ISIS killing thousands.
[00:12:40.438 --> 00:12:41.859]  But does Assad have the motive?
[00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:42.420]  No.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.423]  The old Roman saying, the old Latin saying, qui bono.
[00:12:47.164 --> 00:12:48.144]  Qui bono.
[00:12:48.845 --> 00:12:49.926]  Qui bono.
[00:12:51.267 --> 00:12:52.928]  Who benefits?
[00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:56.011]  Or the police always ask, who's got the motive?
[00:12:58.213 --> 00:12:59.214]  Who's got contact?
[00:13:02.356 --> 00:13:03.517]  Who's got the capacity?
[00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:05.659]  Who's got the will?
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.383]  Well, they know in 90 plus percent of violent crimes, it's a man.
[00:13:11.984 --> 00:13:13.185]  Men have the will to kill people.
[00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.728]  Then you start going from there.
[00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:19.031]  Well, Kibono, who has the background?
[00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:19.892]  Who's done this before?
[00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:20.793]  Who stands to gain?
[00:13:21.514 --> 00:13:23.096]  Who's been caught staging stuff before?
[00:13:23.777 --> 00:13:24.838]  It's open and shut.
[00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.600]  A moron could see this.
[00:13:29.807 --> 00:13:31.827]  And the good news is, it's all coming out.
[00:13:31.907 --> 00:13:32.868]  So that's coming up.
[00:13:32.928 --> 00:13:34.268]  We've got a bunch of the footage of this.
[00:13:34.508 --> 00:13:35.288]  I just showed some.
[00:13:35.308 --> 00:13:36.848]  If you're radio listeners, great.
[00:13:37.028 --> 00:13:37.708]  Please spread the word.
[00:13:37.748 --> 00:13:41.369]  Go to infowars.com forward slash show to see all the different live feeds we've got.
[00:13:42.749 --> 00:13:56.832]  Then, coming up, Pope calls for worldwide ban on all weapons, but he only means on civilian weapons and certain governments, not for the big UN peacekeeper globalists that don't want anybody to be able to stand in their way.
[00:13:56.892 --> 00:13:57.332]  Incredible.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:07.369]  As Trump starts a peace race, the Pope, who has these giant walls around him, but says you shouldn't have a wall around your house, he jumps in with his latest grandstanding.
[00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:17.318]  We're also going to get into some incredible footage of a home invasion in Houston, where the woman is pistol whipped in front of her children.
[00:14:17.338 --> 00:14:19.180]  This should be national news, but it's not.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.161]  We'll break down why.
[00:14:20.782 --> 00:14:22.763]  Such a huge transmission today.
[00:14:23.772 --> 00:14:34.715]  Now, we learned six months ago when Mike Cernovich got the documents from Google, Google confirmed they were theirs, said it was true, that they were spending millions of dollars to delist Alex Jones.
[00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:38.275]  And why did they say?
[00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:45.817]  Because they said he had Ron Paul on, and Ron Paul said the UN said the Syrians staged the chemical attack last April.
[00:14:48.038 --> 00:14:48.918]  That was all confirmed.
[00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.891]  They said, this is fake news, we want him banned for this.
[00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:56.672]  The contract we've been given by the government is to stop him.
[00:14:56.732 --> 00:14:57.492]  That means Obama.
[00:14:58.432 --> 00:15:00.012]  That's millions of dollars.
[00:15:02.913 --> 00:15:03.433]  Five million.
[00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:05.254]  Five million.
[00:15:07.514 --> 00:15:10.255]  That was blacked out in the document we talked to one of the people involved.
[00:15:11.935 --> 00:15:19.557]  Five million dollars to delist InfoWars so when they stage the next chemical attack, we wouldn't be here showing you the truth.
[00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:24.761]  We're trying to stop World War III here because I love my kids, not because I'm some hero.
[00:15:26.624 --> 00:15:28.446]  Trump's trying to do the right thing, but they're trying to set him up.
[00:15:28.466 --> 00:15:33.253]  And they're going to try to stage major stuff to stop him from getting that Nobel Peace Prize and bringing peace.
[00:15:33.793 --> 00:15:36.938]  So get ready and pray, but also get politically involved.
[00:15:38.191 --> 00:15:40.072]  And financially, support InfoWars.
[00:15:40.132 --> 00:15:45.674]  We've got thousands of great products that are top-of-the-line, highly discounted, that support the broadcast but support you.
[00:15:45.974 --> 00:15:50.876]  Super Male, only seven days left to get 50% off on Super Male Vitality for Female Vitality.
[00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.177]  We've got to end the X2 special.
[00:15:53.197 --> 00:15:54.378]  We're ending it on Wednesday.
[00:15:54.398 --> 00:15:55.158]  25% off.
[00:15:55.378 --> 00:15:57.199]  It's getting ready to sell out.
[00:15:57.579 --> 00:15:59.620]  InfoWarsStore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:16:04.642 --> 00:16:22.951]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:28.975]  But the immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:29.335 --> 00:16:29.995]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:30.455 --> 00:16:33.277]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:33.937 --> 00:16:34.898]  And so much more.
[00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:36.599]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.541]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.561 --> 00:16:44.246]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:44.366 --> 00:16:45.547]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:47.509]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:49.971]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:51.432]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:53.433]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:53.994 --> 00:16:54.594]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:55.996]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:56.136 --> 00:16:57.297]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:03.396 --> 00:17:04.117]  I'm so excited.
[00:17:04.137 --> 00:17:13.763]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:17:14.343 --> 00:17:19.527]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:17:19.847 --> 00:17:22.649]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:31.635]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:17:33.736 --> 00:17:38.519]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.821]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:17:41.941 --> 00:17:52.826]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:17:53.327 --> 00:17:54.627]  It is amazing!
[00:17:56.028 --> 00:18:00.991]  Red Pill, now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:18:02.754 --> 00:18:07.237]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[00:18:32.013 --> 00:18:42.138]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:18:42.278 --> 00:18:48.805]  Our Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.

[00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:11.807]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:19:11.867 --> 00:19:19.934]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:19:20.274 --> 00:19:24.976]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:19:25.156 --> 00:19:31.859]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:39.021]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:45.964]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:50.506]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:19:50.626 --> 00:19:53.888]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:19:54.008 --> 00:20:00.150]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.511]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:06.493 --> 00:20:09.114]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.691]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:20:20.351 --> 00:20:23.172]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:33.174 --> 00:20:40.915]  If you read the United Nations Charter, it has a Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[00:20:44.028 --> 00:20:49.633]  Passages, 31 bills, 31 amendments.
[00:20:51.074 --> 00:20:54.877]  We have 10 in our first Bill of Rights, and it's 31.
[00:20:55.077 --> 00:21:03.745]  You have every fabulous right under the sun, just like North Korea has all these great rights, or the old Soviet Union, or Communist China has all these great rights on paper.
[00:21:04.685 --> 00:21:07.748]  But then, when you get to Article 30 and 31, it says anything
[00:21:11.584 --> 00:21:15.566]  that gets in the mission or gets in the way of the UN.
[00:21:17.207 --> 00:21:32.957]  Anything that they decide is against the charter of their operations shut up by the Rockefellers in 1947 is null and void.
[00:21:34.098 --> 00:21:37.020]  And I've even read New York Times articles like a decade ago where
[00:21:37.768 --> 00:21:45.994]  The UN was mowing down whole villages in Africa because they wouldn't go off their ancestral property so they could turn it into a carbon sink.
[00:21:47.035 --> 00:21:48.496]  So they have a gold mine next door.
[00:21:48.797 --> 00:21:51.118]  They go, oh, but this is off limits to balance it out.
[00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:53.881]  And so they would then take their property.
[00:21:54.321 --> 00:21:55.262]  Why do I raise that?
[00:21:55.282 --> 00:21:58.744]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it behind me.
[00:22:00.446 --> 00:22:01.947]  At that point, it's a hundred
[00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:05.410]  And eighty feet tall.
[00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.332]  You can see six foot tall people down there at the bottom.
[00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:10.713]  Then you do the math.
[00:22:13.095 --> 00:22:16.577]  At its high point, it's over a hundred and eighty feet tall.
[00:22:18.464 --> 00:22:22.866]  Yes, the Vatican has a 180-foot wall at its tallest point.
[00:22:23.407 --> 00:22:28.509]  When you go into the courtyard of the Basilica, it's only 60 feet tall.
[00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:30.510]  And they go, oh, but we let people in.
[00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:37.394]  Yes, they have a courtyard, an area where you go into an enclosed space where you're kettled in.
[00:22:38.794 --> 00:22:42.116]  And that has 50 and 60-foot walls.
[00:22:42.396 --> 00:22:47.579]  And that's footage I shot out of a hotel window a few years ago in Rome.
[00:22:51.385 --> 00:22:52.986]  That may even be a live feed we shot.
[00:22:53.006 --> 00:22:53.966]  Yeah, that's from a live feed.
[00:22:54.046 --> 00:22:54.967]  We've got some HD.
[00:22:55.607 --> 00:23:10.854]  But imagine, the Vatican has a 180 foot plus mega wall that stopped the Muslims when they invaded over a thousand years ago.
[00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:19.318]  They were able to take most of Rome, but they couldn't take the Vatican City.
[00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:24.408]  There's also a big castle right across the street from it that's the Roman Fortress.
[00:23:24.428 --> 00:23:25.328]  They couldn't take that.
[00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:34.170]  So they have 180 foot walls around the Vatican.
[00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:41.532]  But the Pope says we should have no walls and that Trump is evil and that walls are of the devil.
[00:23:43.763 --> 00:23:50.629]  Well, the question is then, on Infowars.com, Pope calls for worldwide ban on all weapons.
[00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.291]  And he tweeted out, do we really want peace?
[00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:57.515]  Then let's ban all these weapons so we don't have to live in fear of war.
[00:23:59.636 --> 00:24:03.540]  What has been the UN plan ever since the Rockefellers publicly set it up?
[00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:13.744]  It's to disarm everybody but the United Nations and a few member countries of the UN army, which is now NATO, which is the EU.
[00:24:14.644 --> 00:24:21.606]  And who set up the EU officially in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome?
[00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.727]  It's 500 pages long.
[00:24:23.807 --> 00:24:26.928]  You can pull it up on Wikipedia.
[00:24:27.708 --> 00:24:32.490]  The Treaty of Rome, beginning the EU and world government,
[00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:36.100]  And who officiated over it but the Vatican?
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.961]  And who are the official guards of the Vatican?
[00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:42.022]  The Swiss Guard.
[00:24:42.662 --> 00:24:45.843]  And why is Switzerland left alone and allowed to be neutral?
[00:24:45.883 --> 00:24:50.544]  Because that's where Rome, the city of Rome, puts its money.
[00:24:51.465 --> 00:24:58.787]  So just like in the Hunger Games, you've got the peacekeepers in their loving white uniforms and their loving giant armored vehicles.
[00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:10.816]  They actually use the very same armored vehicles used by the UN, and they come in and you're disarmed, you don't have any weapons, but they do, because they're what?
[00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:13.558]  They're peace keepers!
[00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:27.547]  Now the Treaty of London began the Steele Accord in 1947, but the Treaty of Rome expanded it one decade later and is seen
[00:25:30.087 --> 00:25:31.748]  As the beginning of the EU.
[00:25:31.788 --> 00:25:36.649]  But when people said this is a regional government, Hitler had the plan for the EU, they'd say, oh shut up.
[00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:43.752]  I remember being on air in 1996, when they were still saying it was a conspiracy theory in the news.
[00:25:46.313 --> 00:25:53.295]  If you said the EU was going to be a country, and that it was then going to absorb the nation states, or that it would ever have its own army.
[00:25:53.916 --> 00:25:55.016]  All of that has now happened.
[00:25:56.539 --> 00:26:19.508]  And just last year, they threatened Italian naval ships that are stopping the hundreds of boats a day that come the 90 miles across from Tripoli, North Africa, into the Mediterranean and over to Italy, Greece, Macedonia, Albania, you name it.
[00:26:19.709 --> 00:26:25.311]  And the EU said, we are launching our own navy and we will physically stop you.
[00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:38.202]  Who do you think's running the so-called refugee vagabond bandwagon that just hit the California border yesterday?
[00:26:38.482 --> 00:26:40.524]  Our reporters are about to be there, Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz.
[00:26:41.618 --> 00:26:42.698]  Why do you think that happened?
[00:26:42.718 --> 00:26:56.341]  Because they're opening up a corridor, and Mexico agrees to let anybody in the world get on the trains, come through as long as they don't get off, and flood the U.S., just like they started a decade ago, a corridor through Turkey, and now corridors across the Mediterranean.
[00:26:56.581 --> 00:27:00.502]  They're opening the corridors, letting you know, get here, overwhelm things.
[00:27:00.542 --> 00:27:04.163]  And they say, we're coming here to escape poverty, we're coming here for safety.
[00:27:05.043 --> 00:27:09.884]  But how do you escape the poverty, and not get vetted in any way, like Ellis Island,
[00:27:11.013 --> 00:27:18.578]  And then get indoctrinated into the very globalist socialism that brought your countries like Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cuba down.
[00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:22.761]  How do you escape the Islamic tyranny of North Africa?
[00:27:23.882 --> 00:27:28.425]  And then you come here but you're so brainwashed you just recreate it, as we know they're doing.
[00:27:29.326 --> 00:27:31.307]  This is a planned takeover.
[00:27:33.609 --> 00:27:35.550]  This is a planned operation.
[00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.370]  This is going on.
[00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.872]  Hundreds of boats a day are hitting Spain.
[00:27:40.112 --> 00:27:41.413]  Hundreds of boats a day.
[00:27:41.753 --> 00:27:43.254]  And Soros brags he's funding them.
[00:27:45.455 --> 00:27:49.297]  And now, it's at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:54.600]  Such a critical article with our European Bureau.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.541]  Europe.InfoWars.com.
[00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:59.482]  Just go to InfoWars.com and you'll be right there.
[00:27:59.542 --> 00:28:01.223]  Dan Lyman launching our European Bureau.
[00:28:01.443 --> 00:28:02.344]  He's hiring people right now.
[00:28:03.454 --> 00:28:03.935]  Great job.
[00:28:04.275 --> 00:28:06.837]  Has this stunning article with the stunning information.
[00:28:08.438 --> 00:28:11.620]  UK's new immigration chief, a Pakistani Muslim.
[00:28:14.002 --> 00:28:15.023]  And then it goes through it all.
[00:28:15.063 --> 00:28:15.403]  That's right.
[00:28:15.823 --> 00:28:22.368]  Sidi Khan, a Pakistani Islamicist, who's banned women in bikinis from being on billboards in London.
[00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:25.110]  Sharia law covering up the acid attacks.
[00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:26.972]  Calling for knives to be banned.
[00:28:28.308 --> 00:28:29.688]  Covering up for all the Islamic attacks.
[00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:36.331]  And now, UK's new immigration chief, a Pakistani Muslim, that wants open borders.
[00:28:37.731 --> 00:28:39.392]  So, we'll talk about that more when we come back.
[00:28:39.452 --> 00:28:42.033]  But, the Pope only is working for the globalists.
[00:28:42.373 --> 00:28:44.554]  The globalists have fully seized the Catholic Church, 100% now.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:52.705]  They are saying that Europe's not Christian, open your borders, all the other horrible things he's been saying.
[00:28:53.665 --> 00:29:00.091]  He's got walls, but you can't have walls because they see the demographic of a billion and a half Muslims about to be three billion by 2030.

[00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:23.494]  It may be one of our newest products, but it's one of the fastest selling products we've ever had, and you can tell why by reading all those five-star reviews.
[00:29:23.554 --> 00:29:28.317]  That's why we're dropping it by 25% to help you experience it before it goes back out of stock.
[00:29:28.417 --> 00:29:29.038]  As you age,
[00:29:29.358 --> 00:29:29.818]  We all do.
[00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:34.181]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:35.622]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[00:29:35.823 --> 00:29:39.745]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[00:29:39.765 --> 00:29:41.106]  And again, you look at the studies.
[00:29:41.327 --> 00:29:47.451]  Testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:57.246]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.
[00:29:57.406 --> 00:30:05.571]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthraplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.
[00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:06.891]  It is Alpha Power.
[00:30:06.931 --> 00:30:07.872]  It is back in stock.
[00:30:07.912 --> 00:30:12.995]  It is one of the biggest, best, most favorite products on InformalStore.com and it's back in stock.
[00:30:13.035 --> 00:30:13.515]  We're good.
[00:30:35.154 --> 00:30:37.015]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:37.295]  Go ahead.
[00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:41.336]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[00:30:41.476 --> 00:30:46.477]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[00:30:47.017 --> 00:30:52.559]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[00:30:53.399 --> 00:31:01.660]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:05.221]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[00:31:05.901 --> 00:31:09.522]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[00:31:09.622 --> 00:31:16.463]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[00:31:16.623 --> 00:31:21.264]  I'm just here in California fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[00:31:21.664 --> 00:31:23.446]  They're demonizing my state.
[00:31:23.506 --> 00:31:24.948]  I just can't stand it anymore.
[00:31:24.968 --> 00:31:27.030]  You have changed my life.
[00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.913]  InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[00:31:30.433 --> 00:31:36.019]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:40.584]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[00:31:41.445 --> 00:31:42.746]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[00:31:42.946 --> 00:31:48.271]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[00:31:48.291 --> 00:31:49.652]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[00:31:49.672 --> 00:31:49.813]  Yeah.
[00:31:49.973 --> 00:31:51.834]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[00:31:51.894 --> 00:31:52.715]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[00:31:52.755 --> 00:31:54.457]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[00:31:54.477 --> 00:31:55.458]  We really appreciate you.
[00:31:55.498 --> 00:31:56.499]  Keep up the fight.
[00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:57.640]  We need to take California back.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.160]  Thank you, Desiree.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.441]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:00.142]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:32:02.344 --> 00:32:03.164]  Mike in Arizona.
[00:32:03.204 --> 00:32:04.205]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:32:04.245 --> 00:32:04.546]  Go ahead.
[00:32:05.473 --> 00:32:07.355]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:32:07.395 --> 00:32:16.803]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:32:17.904 --> 00:32:21.267]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:24.149]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[00:32:24.349 --> 00:32:26.530]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:26.990]  Thank you.
[00:32:27.671 --> 00:32:30.132]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[00:32:30.172 --> 00:32:33.915]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[00:32:34.475 --> 00:32:37.457]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:38.498]  They are quality.
[00:32:38.818 --> 00:32:40.078]  I can't wait to get some more.
[00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:43.280]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[00:32:43.441 --> 00:32:44.021]  Absolutely.
[00:32:44.501 --> 00:32:57.448]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:33:06.492 --> 00:33:09.114]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.641 --> 00:33:31.223]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:31.543 --> 00:33:35.705]  It's Alex Jones live from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:36.005 --> 00:33:40.467]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[00:33:46.062 --> 00:33:58.170]  Well, we thought that the globalist pope, the black pope, the Jesuit pope, couldn't top himself when he said Europe shouldn't have borders, the U.S.
[00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.493]  shouldn't have borders, we shouldn't have walls, when he's behind 180 plus foot walls.
[00:34:03.414 --> 00:34:04.114]  But he's topped it.
[00:34:04.695 --> 00:34:10.219]  Pope calls for worldwide ban on all weapons, but of course the United Nations, they're going to keep theirs.
[00:34:11.817 --> 00:34:15.500]  But will he get the Vatican guards to lay down their weapons?
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:28.830]  Just like Hollywood's always wanting our guns, but they've got bodyguards, like the film we all saw at the Oscars this year, where they've got armed SWAT teams and guys with fully-auto weapons strutting around to protect them.
[00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.132]  But boy, do they want our guns.
[00:34:33.413 --> 00:34:36.155]  Simply insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:36.475 --> 00:34:38.177]  That article is on Infowars.com.
[00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.600]  And newswars.com right now.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.080]  Okay.
[00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:48.121]  That ties in to our next report.
[00:34:48.922 --> 00:34:51.902]  People being able to protect themselves.
[00:34:52.583 --> 00:34:59.285]  And we're going to go to this dramatic footage here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:07.487]  And then I'm going to tie it into what's happening in the UK and in the UN where they are openly trying to get
[00:35:09.235 --> 00:35:11.596]  Islamists into all the positions of power.
[00:35:12.576 --> 00:35:20.439]  And again, this is a plan to force us under Islamic control, because there are a billion three hundred million Muslims right now.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.300]  They're having on average six children.
[00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:32.764]  So it's estimated, even by the United Nations World Health Organization, there will be three billion Muslims by 2030.
[00:35:32.844 --> 00:35:36.145]  That's 12 years away.
[00:35:39.073 --> 00:35:40.694]  Three billion.
[00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:43.275]  Chinese population has leveled off.
[00:35:43.415 --> 00:35:44.936]  Indian population is leveling off.
[00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:47.437]  Africa's population is still growing, some.
[00:35:47.477 --> 00:35:48.457]  Latin American, some.
[00:35:49.758 --> 00:35:54.040]  But the big explosion is in Islam, a religion.
[00:35:56.601 --> 00:35:58.522]  And the globalists have decided to go with it.
[00:35:59.162 --> 00:36:00.182]  Because it's authoritarian.
[00:36:00.963 --> 00:36:02.163]  They're targeting Christianity.
[00:36:02.883 --> 00:36:03.524]  And God help us.
[00:36:06.101 --> 00:36:10.644]  When you explain to the Muslims, why don't you give up your Sharia law and all your radicalism and have a reformation?
[00:36:11.204 --> 00:36:12.765]  Why are you trying to come here?
[00:36:16.627 --> 00:36:22.771]  Why are you trying to come here to make it Islamic, but you're fleeing Islam?
[00:36:26.954 --> 00:36:33.818]  And you've got the EU saying they want 200 million Muslims to travel from North Africa to the Middle East by, again, 2030.
[00:36:38.386 --> 00:36:39.947]  Unbelievable.
[00:36:40.688 --> 00:36:42.129]  And folks, they don't convert.
[00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:46.032]  The ones that do get acid thrown in their faces.
[00:36:46.132 --> 00:36:51.377]  Or if you try to have women go to college or have rock and roll music on, like Saddam, you get overthrown by the West.
[00:36:54.099 --> 00:36:56.561]  So the demographics have been looked at, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:56.621 --> 00:37:02.706]  You are to be conquered by a globalist technocracy that oversees
[00:37:03.965 --> 00:37:09.687]  Muslims taking over the planet, where we all have to bow to their sharia law under political correctness.
[00:37:09.747 --> 00:37:11.308]  That's why the left is allied with it.
[00:37:11.328 --> 00:37:12.909]  That's why George Soros funds it.
[00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.550]  It's here.
[00:37:19.011 --> 00:37:19.691]  And this is the fact.
[00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:24.133]  And you go to an airport anywhere in the US, it's women in burkas checking you.
[00:37:25.314 --> 00:37:26.834]  And you go to Europe, it's the same thing.
[00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:33.437]  And then you notice, wait, the police chiefs in London, and the police chiefs in all these big London cities, and German cities, and Dutch cities, and
[00:37:38.803 --> 00:37:48.511]  And the mayors, and the security chiefs, and the intelligence heads, and now the UK's new immigration border chief, Pakistan Muslim.
[00:37:50.053 --> 00:37:52.815]  And you go to Mall of America, this is footage shot there just last year.
[00:37:56.739 --> 00:38:02.303]  They brought in something like a half million Somalis into Minnesota in the last 30 years.
[00:38:04.795 --> 00:38:10.238]  And the point is, every time they stab somebody or kill somebody, the media just goes, we love it.
[00:38:10.479 --> 00:38:11.039]  That's a quote.
[00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:14.321]  And all I'm saying is, man, I don't want to live in Somalia.
[00:38:16.062 --> 00:38:17.023]  And if you're going to come here,
[00:38:19.841 --> 00:38:23.902]  Don't sit there and lecture me when I'm in a cab with you, as has happened.
[00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.343]  Or don't lecture my son, who takes Ubers.
[00:38:27.103 --> 00:38:28.223]  He says, Dad, it's crazy.
[00:38:28.243 --> 00:38:34.064]  He goes, when I take Ubers to Jiu-Jitsu or whatever, he hasn't got his car yet, he's 15, I'll let him take those when he's exercising.
[00:38:34.765 --> 00:38:37.685]  He says, I get proselytized to every few weeks by Muslims!
[00:38:39.206 --> 00:38:40.606]  And he goes, are all of them Muslims?
[00:38:41.046 --> 00:38:46.487]  And I said, son, this is the Islamification.
[00:38:46.527 --> 00:38:48.628]  This is the Islamification of our country.
[00:38:49.662 --> 00:38:50.342]  Of the world.
[00:38:53.404 --> 00:38:59.868]  And you know, if I went to Somalia, I'd be kidnapped in five minutes and killed or sold for ransom.
[00:39:00.228 --> 00:39:07.873]  Imagine if a half million Americans moved to Mogadishu and the Somalis walked into their mall, which of course they don't have that.
[00:39:07.913 --> 00:39:14.897]  They sell women on slave blocks and slavery still goes on there and it's hellish and everybody's basically starving to death.
[00:39:14.917 --> 00:39:16.498]  Their main business is pirating.
[00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:19.280]  But that's their culture, so it's okay.
[00:39:20.606 --> 00:39:24.209]  But imagine if I showed up and said, hey, I'm here!
[00:39:24.409 --> 00:39:25.609]  They'd say, you'd die.
[00:39:29.832 --> 00:39:37.017]  But instead, everywhere I go to get a rent car, every time now, only Somalis are running it.
[00:39:37.117 --> 00:39:40.340]  Hawaii, Denver, Seattle.
[00:39:44.282 --> 00:39:44.643]  Everywhere.
[00:39:45.666 --> 00:39:50.690]  And the Somalis sit there behind the counter and their mouths are hanging open that Alex Jones is there.
[00:39:52.231 --> 00:39:53.111]  And they don't know what to say!
[00:39:53.131 --> 00:39:57.034]  Because I don't dislike them as people, but man, listen!
[00:39:58.055 --> 00:40:00.336]  You're being put in the infrastructure to run things!
[00:40:02.878 --> 00:40:13.986]  You notice the CPS workers in these hundreds of British towns are mainly Muslims, and then above them are pedophile networks, and then they deliver the children to them because it's part of... it's part of Islam!
[00:40:16.229 --> 00:40:24.455]  And it's now finally all over the British news that, okay, these people were right decades ago that said this was going on, and there are tens of thousands of missing girls.
[00:40:24.775 --> 00:40:40.067]  Because in Islam, women wear hoods over their heads and aren't really allowed out of the house without a mail minder, because if you're by yourself, you're fair game to have a bag thrown over you, and you are put into a caravan, and you are shipped to whoever will buy you.
[00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:50.421]  And this is what liberal feminist women have a cuckle fetish for.
[00:40:51.161 --> 00:41:04.906]  I can't tell you how many women I know and that I have friends that have dated women, models, you name it, who got beat up and cucked by their Muslim boyfriend and finally got deprogrammed and got out of it before they got him to fly into the Middle East.
[00:41:05.206 --> 00:41:08.767]  Because once they get you to fly out of here, you're chained up in the basement, baby.
[00:41:10.646 --> 00:41:14.289]  So, we're talking about a hideous serial killer level culture.
[00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:15.631]  I'm sorry, it's fact.
[00:41:16.852 --> 00:41:17.953]  I didn't want to have wars with it.
[00:41:17.993 --> 00:41:19.174]  I didn't want to destabilize it.
[00:41:19.214 --> 00:41:24.839]  I didn't want to knock out the reasonable countries like Qaddafi and like Assad and like Saddam.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.583]  Those are nice guys compared to radical Islam.
[00:41:28.963 --> 00:41:30.385]  They had radical Islam under their foot.
[00:41:30.785 --> 00:41:31.346]  They're gone.
[00:41:32.427 --> 00:41:34.729]  We kicked Hazi Mubarak out and put this crap in.
[00:41:36.818 --> 00:41:39.880]  So when we come back, though, I'm getting into our right to defend ourselves, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:40.980]  God help us.
[00:41:42.061 --> 00:41:47.544]  In this incredible video, armed home invaders pistol-whip mother and threaten her children as they ransack house.
[00:41:47.864 --> 00:41:49.825]  But the Pope agrees with UNIDIR in the UN.
[00:41:52.186 --> 00:41:56.628]  The Pope says he thinks you shouldn't be able to own a firearm.
[00:41:56.648 --> 00:41:57.569]  Well, go to hell, Pope.
[00:41:58.489 --> 00:41:59.450]  Go back to where you came from.
[00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:00.170]  You're not a Christian.
[00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:03.692]  You are, as far as I'm concerned, a false prophet or a good model of it.
[00:42:04.072 --> 00:42:05.033]  Now, briefly,
[00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:08.862]  We're not going to run this for probably six months to a year.
[00:42:09.782 --> 00:42:15.245]  Super Male Vitality is cold-pressed, organic herbs known for stamina, libido, energy.
[00:42:15.265 --> 00:42:18.086]  We have Super Female, Super Male Vitality.
[00:42:18.126 --> 00:42:18.907]  Folks love it.
[00:42:19.087 --> 00:42:20.387]  It's 50% off.
[00:42:20.407 --> 00:42:21.448]  You can get the real red pill.
[00:42:22.208 --> 00:42:23.488]  It takes about seven days to kick in.
[00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:24.929]  SuperMail takes a few hours.
[00:42:25.229 --> 00:42:27.169]  But it's the base that works with it.
[00:42:27.269 --> 00:42:28.790]  If you take the two together, it's really incredible.
[00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.190]  Those are both 50% off separately or together.
[00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.011]  When you buy them together, free shipping.
[00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:34.771]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:36.451]  That special's going until May 7th.
[00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:37.112]  And then it's over.
[00:42:37.232 --> 00:42:37.872]  One week left.
[00:42:43.593 --> 00:42:45.996]  Same thing for Brain Force, 25% off, one week left.
[00:42:46.316 --> 00:42:52.522]  I've got to kill the special on X2, the good halogen, the good iodine, because we are very close to selling it out.
[00:42:52.542 --> 00:42:56.406]  It'll be a month before we get more, and that may be the last run of it if we don't find other suppliers.
[00:42:56.887 --> 00:42:59.490]  So get your X2 at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:00.531]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:01.512]  We'll be back!
[00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:09.498]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[00:43:10.179 --> 00:43:11.961]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[00:43:12.562 --> 00:43:18.429]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.473]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:21.733 --> 00:43:24.755]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:31.038]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:31.699 --> 00:43:38.222]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:38.542 --> 00:43:44.426]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:44.886 --> 00:43:48.488]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:48.988 --> 00:43:57.214]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[00:43:57.595 --> 00:44:03.840]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:09.304]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[00:44:09.945 --> 00:44:18.051]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:44:18.592 --> 00:44:20.273]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:44:20.813 --> 00:44:27.718]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:30.801]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:32.282]  It's not absorbable.
[00:44:32.662 --> 00:44:33.223]  It's toxic.
[00:44:33.903 --> 00:44:46.035]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[00:44:46.155 --> 00:44:48.677]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:44:49.418 --> 00:44:57.786]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs.
[00:44:57.986 --> 00:45:01.969]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:07.074]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[00:45:07.655 --> 00:45:11.218]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[00:45:11.518 --> 00:45:15.402]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:45:15.962 --> 00:45:18.704]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[00:45:18.744 --> 00:45:19.865]  We have a good supply right now.
[00:45:20.285 --> 00:45:21.646]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:24.388]  But this may be the clincher.
[00:45:24.428 --> 00:45:27.650]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:31.473]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:45:31.933 --> 00:45:34.054]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[00:45:34.395 --> 00:45:35.776]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:45:36.116 --> 00:45:43.481]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[00:45:43.801 --> 00:45:44.662]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:45:45.262 --> 00:45:45.422]  Yeah.
[00:46:00.179 --> 00:46:00.800]  I don't think so.
[00:46:16.832 --> 00:46:18.014]  That we can work this out.
[00:46:36.135 --> 00:46:38.937]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[00:46:39.257 --> 00:46:47.522]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[00:46:48.063 --> 00:46:52.405]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[00:46:52.846 --> 00:46:59.390]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:06.326 --> 00:47:09.169]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.256 --> 00:47:21.240]  Well, here's the big viral video that's been nominated for a top music award this year.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:30.769]  This is the Von Iver, Bon Iver, however you say it, breakdown that Super Deluxe put out in an attempt to demonize us but only woke folks up more.
[00:47:30.809 --> 00:47:31.150]  Here it is.
[00:47:35.794 --> 00:47:38.075]  I've had enough of these people.
[00:47:38.115 --> 00:47:41.536]  They're a bunch of Christian murderous scum.
[00:47:41.576 --> 00:47:45.177]  They're on giant death factories keeping babies alive.
[00:47:45.217 --> 00:47:47.217]  They're selling their body parts.
[00:47:47.457 --> 00:47:50.018]  What more do you need to know about these people?
[00:47:50.118 --> 00:47:52.839]  I'll go out and face these scum.
[00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:56.400]  They literally crawl out from under rocks.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.761]  They have green looking skin.
[00:47:58.861 --> 00:48:01.541]  And they run around screaming we love Satan.
[00:48:01.621 --> 00:48:03.482]  We want to eat babies.
[00:48:05.399 --> 00:48:07.181]  I have them on video.
[00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:09.743]  I f***ing love Satan, so f*** you.
[00:48:09.843 --> 00:48:10.683]  I kill my kids.
[00:48:11.244 --> 00:48:14.527]  Hillary's in the creepy weird six-step man.
[00:48:14.627 --> 00:48:17.529]  Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:24.615]  She sleeps in the same room with that creepy weirdo woman whose mother wears a full overhead.
[00:48:24.975 --> 00:48:26.116]  What the hell?
[00:48:26.156 --> 00:48:28.618]  That woman number one is ugly.
[00:48:28.958 --> 00:48:32.641]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:36.007]  I'm told her and Obama just stink.
[00:48:37.386 --> 00:48:46.612]  There's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[00:48:46.652 --> 00:48:48.533]  He says me and Hillary are demons.
[00:48:48.873 --> 00:48:50.555]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[00:48:50.815 --> 00:48:52.656]  Ain't that something?
[00:48:52.676 --> 00:48:55.218]  I have never seen or smelled any woman like that.
[00:48:55.498 --> 00:48:55.938]  Ever.
[00:48:55.978 --> 00:48:57.039]  People are telling me she smells.
[00:48:57.079 --> 00:48:59.340]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that badly?
[00:49:06.539 --> 00:49:13.702]  My spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go, ah, ah, ah.
[00:49:15.743 --> 00:49:17.924]  We're such self-centered crap.
[00:49:18.044 --> 00:49:22.586]  We don't even notice and it's self-rising up against us.
[00:49:22.686 --> 00:49:29.229]  Millions of pointed people of the very worst type and I'm so pissed.
[00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.551]  We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall.
[00:49:38.112 --> 00:49:41.314]  We're gonna stab your wife, your son.
[00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:48.157]  We're gonna stab you with a butcher knife.
[00:49:48.518 --> 00:49:54.541]  And then the police chief is gonna say, we love our Somalis.
[00:49:54.761 --> 00:49:56.402]  We love our Muslims.
[00:49:56.762 --> 00:49:57.963]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:49:58.663 --> 00:50:00.144]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:50:03.675 --> 00:50:09.221]  I was watching Fox News as I worked out this morning, and they had the police chief on making excuses from that town in Minnesota.
[00:50:09.842 --> 00:50:15.608]  And they had the Fox News host, this is the Fair and Balanced Channel, going, Donald Trump really stepped in at this time.
[00:50:15.928 --> 00:50:22.896]  He said it was a bombing before it had officially been called a bombing, and Hillary's on him, and she's got some really good points!
[00:50:32.594 --> 00:50:33.395]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:50:34.356 --> 00:50:52.751]  We've got a plan, just like the one they carried out starting about a decade ago in Europe, to advertise Soros and UN-funded groups to caravan in through Turkey, through Syria, and that caravanning began an entire invasion, seven years ago, of Syria itself.
[00:50:54.352 --> 00:50:58.015]  And you've got the Zodiac boats coming across the Mediterranean from North Africa into Europe.
[00:50:58.396 --> 00:51:06.723]  More than 10 million military-age men just the last six, seven years have gotten in to Europe and are now carrying out jihad.
[00:51:07.244 --> 00:51:10.126]  Raping, killing, stealing, you name it.
[00:51:10.146 --> 00:51:12.669]  Well now they're opening up a caravan
[00:51:14.138 --> 00:51:17.901]  With another Soros UN-funded group into the United States.
[00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:20.082]  Now, Obama already had these tarivans up.
[00:51:20.663 --> 00:51:23.124]  Four years ago, he was calling it, you know, children's migration.
[00:51:23.145 --> 00:51:29.429]  But only 17% were under the age of 18, even our own Border Patrol and ICE admits.
[00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:38.856]  But now they're opening it back up to humanize the poor woman with her kids and all this, to then fully break it, and then no one will say, hey, why isn't Mexico taking these people?
[00:51:40.512 --> 00:51:50.795]  No, it's all how Mexico is going to create a corridor via their railways to bring folks up who've now arrived, as you see as a TV viewer CBS is covering.
[00:51:52.135 --> 00:52:01.738]  Thousands and thousands of people saying we deserve to be in to open it up so these images can be shown in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Venezuela, you name it.
[00:52:03.538 --> 00:52:05.319]  Guatemala collapsing
[00:52:06.854 --> 00:52:10.316]  But not collapsing into Mexico, because there's already that pressure on the southern border.
[00:52:10.877 --> 00:52:12.758]  And Mexico's a lot richer than those countries, believe it or not.
[00:52:12.778 --> 00:52:14.959]  They're in the top few percent of third-world countries.
[00:52:14.979 --> 00:52:17.000]  They're almost a first-world country in many areas.
[00:52:17.681 --> 00:52:19.142]  So Mexico isn't going to take this.
[00:52:19.602 --> 00:52:26.146]  They're sending these people here with the idea that we've got to accept it, and then if we don't, let them in.
[00:52:26.186 --> 00:52:26.686]  We're evil.
[00:52:26.726 --> 00:52:27.447]  We're bad folks.
[00:52:29.165 --> 00:52:33.266]  And it's now come out that these type of immigrants are twice as likely to commit crime.
[00:52:33.286 --> 00:52:35.587]  They've tried to spin it and say they're all innocent, they're all good.
[00:52:35.607 --> 00:52:41.569]  A very large portion are nice people, but there's a minority that are extremely criminal.
[00:52:42.509 --> 00:52:47.031]  Most of them that are in that minority that are extremely criminal are fleeing justice already.
[00:52:48.751 --> 00:52:50.612]  They're mentally ill or they're psychotic.
[00:52:51.499 --> 00:52:52.420]  And they're coming up here.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.880]  Or they're destitute.
[00:52:54.241 --> 00:52:55.762]  And California's already collapsing.
[00:52:56.022 --> 00:52:57.563]  But California's saying, come on in.
[00:52:57.903 --> 00:52:58.483]  Come on in.
[00:52:58.523 --> 00:52:59.063]  Come on in.
[00:53:00.384 --> 00:53:01.725]  Now notice, it's a pincer attack.
[00:53:02.205 --> 00:53:02.986]  A two-sided attack.
[00:53:03.526 --> 00:53:07.388]  The globalists are going to bring in Latin American, socialist, brainwashed people.
[00:53:08.509 --> 00:53:09.450]  Predominantly socialist.
[00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:13.232]  They show up in socialist California, Oregon, Washington.
[00:53:14.513 --> 00:53:15.913]  They're then taught to hate the country.
[00:53:15.953 --> 00:53:16.674]  They're brainwashed.
[00:53:18.527 --> 00:53:20.628]  They're then put into the Democratic Party machine.
[00:53:21.068 --> 00:53:22.609]  They're kept as a permanent underclass.
[00:53:23.229 --> 00:53:23.569]  Boom!
[00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:29.792]  Brought into the universities to expand the hate machine and the whole anti-white, anti-El Norte program.
[00:53:30.072 --> 00:53:32.153]  If most of them weren't racist before, they will be.
[00:53:32.954 --> 00:53:36.755]  That's the left attack of the left-hand pincer.
[00:53:37.656 --> 00:53:46.360]  The right pincer, again, a pincer comes together like a claw, like a nutcracker, is the Islamist system coming in.
[00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:51.068]  With its huge demographic boom, to be managed by the same socialists.
[00:53:51.448 --> 00:53:54.973]  So the socialist left is allied with Islam, Islam's allied with them.
[00:53:54.993 --> 00:53:57.776]  You know, they're throwing gays off buildings and enslaving women.
[00:53:58.617 --> 00:54:02.161]  Because it's part of a larger globalist takeover that the globalists are directing.
[00:54:02.362 --> 00:54:04.444]  And the globalists admit this is their plan.
[00:54:04.704 --> 00:54:07.187]  But now, all over the world, people know it, they understand it.
[00:54:07.848 --> 00:54:12.412]  Now, the Pope's saying open borders, but not, again, with his 180-foot walls.
[00:54:12.872 --> 00:54:17.596]  He also says turn in all your guns today, but he's still going to have armed guards.
[00:54:18.477 --> 00:54:22.200]  And the story is out of Houston.
[00:54:23.141 --> 00:54:27.945]  Armed home invaders pistol-whipped mother and threatened her children as they ransacked the house.
[00:54:27.985 --> 00:54:33.330]  Now, this was only in the Metro out of the UK, and in a few Houston publications.
[00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:35.311]  I saw almost no coverage of this over the weekend.
[00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:35.952]  And why is it?
[00:54:37.042 --> 00:54:44.928]  Because it's white people being pistol whipped and beaten by black people who are clearly racist and hateful.
[00:54:45.669 --> 00:54:51.874]  Now imagine if white people were beating a black woman and black children, there'd be riots in the streets, this would be on every channel.
[00:54:52.174 --> 00:55:00.801]  But because it doesn't fit the racial narrative, you read the articles, it says nothing about them being black men and their mask falling off because they're such idiots.
[00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:03.122]  Again, this should be decried
[00:55:04.579 --> 00:55:07.142]  And it's obviously racially directed in Houston.
[00:55:07.483 --> 00:55:11.208]  They have the new Black Panther Party saying, if you're black, go out and rob white people.
[00:55:11.729 --> 00:55:12.490]  That's been in the news.
[00:55:12.771 --> 00:55:14.533]  So let's go ahead and roll some of this footage.
[00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:16.396]  Again, it's very dramatic.
[00:55:16.456 --> 00:55:19.561]  I've tweeted it at Real Alex Jones, if you're a radio listener and want to see it, here it is.
[00:55:24.864 --> 00:55:25.144]  No!
[00:55:25.545 --> 00:55:26.646]  Oh my gosh!
[00:55:26.746 --> 00:55:26.946]  No!
[00:55:27.206 --> 00:55:29.448]  Oh my gosh!
[00:55:29.488 --> 00:55:29.568]  No!
[00:55:29.969 --> 00:55:31.350]  I can't make it!
[00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.212]  I can't make it!
[00:55:33.512 --> 00:55:34.633]  Oh my gosh!
[00:55:34.893 --> 00:55:35.374]  I can't!
[00:55:35.594 --> 00:55:36.074]  I can't!
[00:55:36.134 --> 00:55:37.075]  Hey!
[00:55:37.115 --> 00:55:37.395]  Hey!
[00:55:37.456 --> 00:55:37.716]  Hey!
[00:55:38.356 --> 00:55:39.017]  Hey!
[00:55:39.157 --> 00:55:40.378]  Hey!
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.260]  So!
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.281]  Okay!
[00:55:50.179 --> 00:55:50.419]  Please don't.
[00:55:50.439 --> 00:55:50.779]  Please don't.
[00:55:50.799 --> 00:55:51.040]  Please don't.
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:51.360]  Please don't.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:51.780]  Please don't.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.081]  Please don't.
[00:55:52.101 --> 00:55:52.541]  Please don't.
[00:55:52.581 --> 00:55:52.841]  Please don't.
[00:55:52.861 --> 00:55:53.241]  Please don't.
[00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:53.562]  Please don't.
[00:55:53.602 --> 00:55:53.942]  Please don't.
[00:55:53.962 --> 00:55:54.222]  Please don't.
[00:55:55.743 --> 00:55:56.264]  Please don't.
[00:55:56.364 --> 00:55:56.624]  Please don't.
[00:55:56.644 --> 00:55:56.904]  Please don't.
[00:55:56.924 --> 00:55:57.245]  Please don't.
[00:55:57.365 --> 00:55:57.685]  Please don't.
[00:55:57.705 --> 00:55:58.025]  Please don't.
[00:55:58.065 --> 00:55:58.826]  Please don't.
[00:55:58.866 --> 00:55:59.206]  Please don't.
[00:55:59.226 --> 00:55:59.787]  Please don't.
[00:55:59.807 --> 00:56:00.207]  Please don't.
[00:56:00.527 --> 00:56:00.968]  Please don't.
[00:56:01.588 --> 00:56:01.948]  Please don't.
[00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.689]  Please don't.
[00:56:02.729 --> 00:56:03.269]  Please don't.
[00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:03.690]  Please don't.
[00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:04.711]  Please don't.
[00:56:04.931 --> 00:56:05.191]  Please don't.
[00:56:05.211 --> 00:56:05.471]  Please don't.
[00:56:05.511 --> 00:56:05.751]  Please don't.
[00:56:05.851 --> 00:56:06.552]  Please don't.
[00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:07.293]  Please don't.
[00:56:07.313 --> 00:56:07.793]  Please don't.
[00:56:07.813 --> 00:56:08.153]  Please don't.
[00:56:08.173 --> 00:56:08.434]  Please don't.
[00:56:08.494 --> 00:56:09.334]  Please don't.
[00:56:09.354 --> 00:56:09.654]  Please don't.
[00:56:09.675 --> 00:56:10.135]  Please don't.
[00:56:10.175 --> 00:56:10.475]  Please don't.
[00:56:10.495 --> 00:56:10.956]  Please don't.
[00:56:11.036 --> 00:56:11.636]  Please don't.
[00:56:11.676 --> 00:56:12.036]  Please don't.
[00:56:12.096 --> 00:56:12.437]  Please don't.
[00:56:12.457 --> 00:56:12.697]  Please don't.
[00:56:12.717 --> 00:56:12.957]  Please don't.
[00:56:12.977 --> 00:56:13.738]  Please don't.
[00:56:13.818 --> 00:56:14.098]  Please don't.
[00:56:14.118 --> 00:56:14.638]  Please don't.
[00:56:14.658 --> 00:56:14.979]  Please don't.
[00:56:14.999 --> 00:56:15.659]  Please don't.
[00:56:15.679 --> 00:56:15.960]  Please don't.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.780]  Please don't.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.100]  Please don't.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:17.401]  Please don't.
[00:56:17.421 --> 00:56:17.661]  Please don't.
[00:56:18.553 --> 00:56:21.676]  Now, only maybe one out of a thousand of these get caught on video.
[00:56:21.696 --> 00:56:27.722]  A lot of the new home security systems have cameras that trigger when you're coming in and coming out.
[00:56:28.682 --> 00:56:31.865]  I mean, I'll tell people point blank, I don't like Big Brother, but I'm under such threat.
[00:56:32.326 --> 00:56:36.369]  I've got multiple systems, backup, you name it, so they can't send in one of their teams as easy.
[00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:38.571]  I'm talking about the deep state.
[00:56:41.161 --> 00:56:47.904]  If you're a radio listener, you gotta go see the footage of pointing guns at little kids, hitting little kids, little kids have the instinct to try to get away.
[00:56:47.924 --> 00:56:52.406]  Again, we're talking about black racist thugs beating white people.
[00:56:53.026 --> 00:56:54.047]  But where is the media?
[00:56:54.087 --> 00:56:58.189]  Because if you had white people doing this, it would be the end of the world.
[00:56:58.269 --> 00:56:58.969]  Cities would burn.
[00:56:59.329 --> 00:57:01.010]  Now, I know most black people aren't racist.
[00:57:01.957 --> 00:57:17.605]  But the media is covering up stuff like this so they can create the illusion that only whites commit crimes against blacks, when the leftist media pushing this narrative has created a climate where for every white person that's attacked by a black person, it's 12 to 1.
[00:57:18.466 --> 00:57:25.470]  12 white people are attacked by black people for every time a black person is attacked by a white person.
[00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:26.830]  12 to 1 on average.
[00:57:28.531 --> 00:57:29.612]  Now, let me say the obvious.
[00:57:31.195 --> 00:57:31.675]  My God.
[00:57:32.436 --> 00:57:35.519]  You talk about getting... I don't care if you're white, black, polka-dotted.
[00:57:36.539 --> 00:57:39.081]  I catch you in my house, you are going down.
[00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:40.322]  You're a debtor than a doornail.
[00:57:40.342 --> 00:57:42.164]  And that woman needs to go get her concealed carry.
[00:57:42.464 --> 00:57:43.565]  She needs to have her firearm.
[00:57:43.865 --> 00:57:47.728]  And next time she sees something like that going on, somebody in your house with weapons, grease them.
[00:57:48.389 --> 00:57:49.550]  Kill them debtor than a hammer.
[00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:52.092]  That's what the Second Amendment's all about, and we have a right to it.
[00:57:53.584 --> 00:57:54.305]  I'm so excited.
[00:57:54.385 --> 00:58:03.931]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:58:04.531 --> 00:58:09.695]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:58:10.035 --> 00:58:12.837]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:58:13.037 --> 00:58:21.803]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:58:23.904 --> 00:58:28.706]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:58:29.206 --> 00:58:31.987]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:58:32.127 --> 00:58:43.011]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:58:43.511 --> 00:58:44.792]  It is amazing!
[00:58:46.192 --> 00:58:51.154]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:58:52.952 --> 00:58:54.333]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:58:54.613 --> 00:58:55.914]  You can't survive without it.
[00:58:56.094 --> 00:58:56.994]  But where do you get it?
[00:58:57.294 --> 00:59:03.058]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:59:03.278 --> 00:59:09.001]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:59:09.201 --> 00:59:26.068]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:59:26.448 --> 00:59:28.590]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:30.151]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:59:30.412 --> 00:59:31.172]  Easy assembly.
[00:59:31.453 --> 00:59:32.073]  Low maintenance.
[00:59:32.373 --> 00:59:34.195]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:59:53.806 --> 00:59:57.918]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.744]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:21.374 --> 01:00:22.054]  Big Brother.
[01:00:22.514 --> 01:00:23.775]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:24.315 --> 01:00:26.036]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:27.676]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:27.897 --> 01:00:29.077]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:29.557 --> 01:00:34.079]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:49.225]  So, imagine you come home from work with your three children, and there are moron, idiot dirtbags with their pants hanging down almost at their knees.
[01:00:52.213 --> 01:00:56.556]  Pointing guns at your three-year-old children and beating them upside the head.
[01:00:59.358 --> 01:01:05.823]  And you've got moron idiots that don't even know how to keep masks on screaming at the women.
[01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:07.664]  And this footage is just now coming out in court.
[01:01:07.704 --> 01:01:08.945]  This happened back on February 28th.
[01:01:10.581 --> 01:01:15.284]  Armed home invaders pistol-whip mother and threaten her children as they ransack a house.
[01:01:15.384 --> 01:01:21.249]  How can you not say we have a right to weapons when the criminals are only going to have them if you take them?
[01:01:21.429 --> 01:01:23.130]  They took the guns 20 years ago in England.
[01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:25.932]  They've now got a higher crime rate than New York City.
[01:01:26.512 --> 01:01:32.096]  Now they're trying to ban, of course, in everybody's face.
[01:01:33.717 --> 01:01:34.438]  They're trying to
[01:01:36.584 --> 01:01:39.027]  Ban knives in England or make you get a license for them.
[01:01:39.808 --> 01:01:48.279]  Horrifying video footage shows four masked home invaders pistol whip a pregnant woman and point guns at her children after smashing into their house.
[01:01:49.278 --> 01:01:56.565]  The disturbing surveillance footage was captured at the family's home in East Harris County near Houston, Texas on February 28th.
[01:01:57.246 --> 01:02:07.115]  After barging into the home, the two men demand money and valuables from the homeowner, seemingly oblivious to the cries of fear from her terrified children while they slap them and hit them.
[01:02:08.076 --> 01:02:10.218]  The shout, come on, where's the money?
[01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:17.715]  And slapping the mothers across the back of the head with a handgun as she screams, my kids, my kids.
[01:02:18.075 --> 01:02:20.337]  She tries to comfort her children and cradle them.
[01:02:24.081 --> 01:02:25.442]  You know, who's that black reporter?
[01:02:26.523 --> 01:02:29.045]  She's the same one that said, oh, poor white people.
[01:02:29.085 --> 01:02:33.570]  And somebody brought up that a lot of these racial attacks are happening to folks wearing Make America Great hats.
[01:02:34.397 --> 01:02:39.963]  People are saying racial slurs while they beat them, or even just white people, period, are being told, you know, you voted for Trump, so we're going to beat you up.
[01:02:40.344 --> 01:02:41.545]  She said, oh, poor white people.
[01:02:41.585 --> 01:02:42.747]  What about these poor white people?
[01:02:42.807 --> 01:02:47.932]  Again, white people have been so dehumanized, and most white people are not racist.
[01:02:48.133 --> 01:02:51.497]  Actually, they're guilty, and they have a guilty conscience, even though they didn't do anything.
[01:02:51.857 --> 01:02:55.161]  But instead now, that guilt is turning to anger, and it's going to turn into racism.
[01:02:56.667 --> 01:03:01.431]  So the media needs to start exposing this instead of covering it up because that only creates more anger.
[01:03:01.451 --> 01:03:04.574]  But see, they want people to be divided in this country.
[01:03:04.975 --> 01:03:05.655]  That's the plan.
[01:03:08.898 --> 01:03:14.564]  She tries to comfort her children and cradle them, yelling, we just gotta let it go.
[01:03:14.644 --> 01:03:16.205]  They're just going to take something.
[01:03:16.866 --> 01:03:20.269]  But they are too distraught by the stress of the ordeal and soon begin to scream again.
[01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:22.010]  They are seen going upstairs.
[01:03:23.677 --> 01:03:28.400]  But they don't say it's a black male until later, which is actually a crime in the media in Sweden to say what color somebody is.
[01:03:29.021 --> 01:03:29.261]  Seriously.
[01:03:49.605 --> 01:03:58.336]  They shared the video on social media, writing investigators say the first suspect is a black male, approximately 6'1", weighs 165 lbs and is around 25 years of age, wearing a grey hoodie.
[01:03:59.237 --> 01:04:02.621]  The second person is a black male, 5'11", 150 lbs.
[01:04:03.262 --> 01:04:05.384]  So we're going to go to break with playing this video.
[01:04:05.404 --> 01:04:06.606]  Let's go ahead and roll that video again.
[01:04:13.133 --> 01:04:13.313]  No!
[01:04:13.773 --> 01:04:14.273]  Oh my God!
[01:04:14.373 --> 01:04:14.413]  No!
[01:04:14.453 --> 01:04:15.794]  Oh my God!
[01:04:15.994 --> 01:04:16.074]  No!
[01:04:16.094 --> 01:04:16.294]  My kids!
[01:04:16.994 --> 01:04:17.194]  My kids!
[01:04:17.494 --> 01:04:17.694]  My kids!
[01:04:17.794 --> 01:04:18.734]  What do you want to do?
[01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:18.994]  Oh my God!
[01:04:19.094 --> 01:04:19.514]  My kids!
[01:04:19.714 --> 01:04:19.974]  My kids!
[01:04:20.034 --> 01:04:20.094]  Hey!
[01:04:20.114 --> 01:04:20.174]  Hey!
[01:04:20.214 --> 01:04:20.355]  Hey!
[01:04:20.695 --> 01:04:20.855]  Hey!
[01:04:21.075 --> 01:04:21.195]  Hey!
[01:04:21.215 --> 01:04:21.295]  Hey!
[01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:21.555]  Hey!
[01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:21.915]  Hey!
[01:04:21.935 --> 01:04:21.995]  Hey!
[01:04:22.075 --> 01:04:22.275]  Hey!
[01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:22.455]  Hey!
[01:04:22.475 --> 01:04:22.635]  Hey!
[01:04:22.695 --> 01:04:22.835]  Hey!
[01:04:22.895 --> 01:04:22.995]  Hey!

[01:04:41.659 --> 01:04:41.719]  Hey!
[01:04:41.759 --> 01:04:41.839]  Hey!
[01:04:51.942 --> 01:04:53.164]  We need a second amendment.
[01:04:54.185 --> 01:04:57.810]  Whether you're black, whether you're white, whatever you are, you have a right to defend yourself in this garbage.
[01:04:58.451 --> 01:05:00.574]  We don't want to live like they do in Chicago and Houston.
[01:05:08.243 --> 01:05:11.344]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:05:11.384 --> 01:05:11.904]  You're on the air.
[01:05:11.924 --> 01:05:12.464]  Thanks for holding.
[01:05:12.845 --> 01:05:13.965]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:05:14.165 --> 01:05:14.765]  Hey, brother.
[01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:15.425]  Good, man.
[01:05:15.446 --> 01:05:16.266]  Thank you for calling.
[01:05:16.326 --> 01:05:16.886]  Hey, hey.
[01:05:17.006 --> 01:05:21.408]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:05:21.608 --> 01:05:27.990]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:29.810]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:36.073]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.333]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:40.834]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[01:05:40.894 --> 01:05:42.414]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:05:42.795 --> 01:05:44.415]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:05:44.855 --> 01:05:45.575]  And exactly.
[01:05:45.595 --> 01:05:49.896]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:05:50.197 --> 01:05:50.497]  Boom!
[01:05:50.617 --> 01:05:53.437]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:05:53.497 --> 01:05:54.038]  It's amazing.
[01:05:54.098 --> 01:05:55.378]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[01:05:55.458 --> 01:05:58.319]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:06:11.053 --> 01:06:21.940]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:06:26.143 --> 01:06:32.847]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:32.927 --> 01:06:34.228]  We're now into the second hour.
[01:06:35.048 --> 01:06:36.790]  We have got so much to get you this hour.
[01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:38.511]  I intend to open the phones up as well.
[01:06:41.812 --> 01:06:47.117]  We have the Pope coming out and saying it's time to disarm everyone.
[01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:54.102]  But he doesn't mean disarm the UN, or NATO, or the Vatican Police, or the Swiss Guard.
[01:06:55.103 --> 01:06:55.944]  He just means you.
[01:06:56.665 --> 01:07:03.430]  When he says you can't have a wall around your house, or you can't have a wall around your country's border, that's only for you.
[01:07:05.032 --> 01:07:06.213]  Because the Pope's a globalist.
[01:07:07.133 --> 01:07:08.695]  That story's up on Infowars.com.
[01:07:12.369 --> 01:07:16.491]  And it ties in with UK's new immigration chief, a Pakistani Muslim.
[01:07:17.591 --> 01:07:19.752]  This from Dan Lyman and Infowars Europe.
[01:07:21.753 --> 01:07:26.995]  The son of Pakistani immigrants has been named the United Kingdom's new Home Secretary.
[01:07:27.015 --> 01:07:33.478]  After his predecessor resigned amidst allegations he was seeking to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.
[01:07:34.619 --> 01:07:35.059]  That's right.
[01:07:37.435 --> 01:07:49.125]  Sajjad Javad is being hailed as the country's first ethnic minority to hold the position, which entails oversight of immigration and citizenship affairs, national security and policing.
[01:07:49.525 --> 01:08:05.619]  And it follows the same pattern in Western Europe and other areas, just like the Islamic mayors are putting in all the news last week where the Muslim grooming gangs work with the child protective services in the major towns to actually kidnap children for the pedophile elite.
[01:08:07.165 --> 01:08:29.162]  Well, we're going to have a strategy in place that does something that previous Home Secretary set out last week when she made a statement to Parliament to ensure that we have an immigration policy that's fair, treats people with respect and with decency, which means don't let conservatives and libertarians even travel to the country, don't let nationalists leave the country, and let in as many unvetted Muslims as possible.
[01:08:29.902 --> 01:08:36.788]  That would be one of his most urgent tasks, to make sure that we look carefully at the policy and make sure it achieves just that, fairness.
[01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:40.505]  Isn't that just sweet and nice?
[01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:52.734]  Following the 2017 Islamic terrorist massacre of Westminster Bridge in London, Javid told attendees of Muslim News Awards for Excellence that Muslims cannot also be murderers.
[01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:55.150]  I'm no religious scholar.
[01:08:55.210 --> 01:09:05.016]  Many years have passed since I attended the Koran as a child, but even I know that there's no justification for what happened in Paris or the kind of indiscriminate slaughter that came to Westminster last week.
[01:09:05.616 --> 01:09:06.336]  What a nice guy.
[01:09:06.356 --> 01:09:10.559]  Of course, under the Koran, they can tell you they're your friend and then kill you.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.923]  All I know is the globalists plan to Islamify the entire world.
[01:09:19.685 --> 01:09:21.626]  Now, there's a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.352]  But one thing that's so big I need to cover it again.
[01:09:25.372 --> 01:09:38.803]  I pointed out yesterday that if they're going to give a peace prize to Obama for launching a bunch of wars, then Trump for getting peace on the Korean Peninsula very, very close, and getting them to get ready to sign a deal to end the war, that enough right there deserves a peace prize.
[01:09:38.843 --> 01:09:41.826]  But again, a Nobel Prize is a joke.
[01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:46.890]  We'll be looking at that.
[01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:48.872]  There's a very interesting article here that is so
[01:09:50.566 --> 01:10:08.543]  Revealing that I don't normally read a whole article on air, but I ought to read it just to give you the bizarre logic and really the Alice in Wonderland Tea Party nature of this particular story out of Splinter News by Cleo Chang.
[01:10:10.084 --> 01:10:12.486]  Treat Kanye West like a conspiracy theorist.
[01:10:13.507 --> 01:10:16.310]  And they go on to say he's dangerous like Alex Jones.
[01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:24.863]  And that what he's saying is bad and spreading and so he should just be ignored and or basically banned.
[01:10:26.243 --> 01:10:31.965]  What Kanye's saying is we have thought police in this country trying to bully people and that he supports open free thought and open discussion.
[01:10:33.565 --> 01:10:35.526]  It's not about Kanye West whether you love him or hate him.
[01:10:39.307 --> 01:10:45.869]  It's about the fact that he's absolutely right about free expression being under attack but they say that's a conspiracy theory
[01:10:47.534 --> 01:10:49.475]  But then call for him to be shut up.
[01:10:52.377 --> 01:10:54.078]  Don't listen to Kanye, he's crazy.
[01:10:54.138 --> 01:10:55.579]  Nobody's trying to restrict your speech.
[01:10:56.059 --> 01:10:58.020]  That's why we need to shut him up.
[01:11:02.963 --> 01:11:04.324]  And of course, I'm all over the article.
[01:11:06.185 --> 01:11:07.186]  This is amazing.
[01:11:09.409 --> 01:11:11.530]  Attacks on free speech are happening all over the world.
[01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:14.990]  In Europe, they've basically banned criticizing Islam.
[01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.191]  They arrest people.
[01:11:16.691 --> 01:11:17.831]  Police chiefs get fired.
[01:11:17.871 --> 01:11:21.932]  They talk about 90 plus percent of the rapes in Stockholm being Islamic.
[01:11:25.233 --> 01:11:28.434]  There's the most dramatic set of footage that is still online.
[01:11:28.454 --> 01:11:29.594]  Last time I checked, we saved it.
[01:11:30.094 --> 01:11:31.915]  Of women going to these diversity rallies.
[01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:35.224]  In Germany and Sweden and other areas.
[01:11:36.145 --> 01:11:42.190]  And like 50 guys will grab a really supermodel looking woman and grab her and hold her legs.
[01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:44.392]  Two guys hold each leg, two guys hold each arm.
[01:11:44.432 --> 01:11:49.017]  They're crying and they gang rape them for hours and the cops are 30 yards away just looking.
[01:11:50.434 --> 01:11:52.775]  And the women are then interviewed later.
[01:11:53.495 --> 01:11:54.476]  They go, well, they hurt me.
[01:11:54.536 --> 01:11:55.056]  I'm bleeding.
[01:11:55.076 --> 01:11:57.497]  I'm really hurt, but I'm still not racist.
[01:11:57.557 --> 01:11:58.417]  I want more to come.
[01:11:58.437 --> 01:11:59.097]  Please don't leave.
[01:11:59.377 --> 01:12:08.300]  Just last week, a woman got gang raped anally, and she was in the news saying, well, I went to the refugee center to show them I'm not racist, and I still don't want them deported.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.981]  I understand they're victims.
[01:12:10.001 --> 01:12:16.023]  That's why they raped me in the... I mean, I'm sorry to talk like that, but that's what they did.
[01:12:16.043 --> 01:12:16.963]  Yeah, this is one this week.
[01:12:17.343 --> 01:12:18.804]  Refugee rapes 12-year-old girl.
[01:12:19.821 --> 01:12:21.001]  Didn't know it was illegal.
[01:12:22.582 --> 01:12:23.522]  That's in Sweden too.
[01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:29.423]  And then the courts say, well, we're not going to give you any jail time.
[01:12:29.463 --> 01:12:30.683]  It's part of your religion.
[01:12:34.344 --> 01:12:38.085]  And I'm only pointing out that we've turned our life force off.
[01:12:38.105 --> 01:12:39.885]  We've turned our self-preservation off.
[01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:44.166]  And then you see the footage that I've tweeted out at RealAlexJones.
[01:12:44.206 --> 01:12:46.267]  I'm going to have it reposted at Infowars.com.
[01:12:47.936 --> 01:12:52.239]  As soon as we take those last, I guess, two segments and put them out so people can see.
[01:12:57.582 --> 01:13:00.124]  Two black men robbing and beating women and children.
[01:13:00.144 --> 01:13:02.345]  And you say, well, that's not racist.
[01:13:02.386 --> 01:13:03.606]  You don't know they meant it because they're white.
[01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:05.107]  You're right.
[01:13:05.207 --> 01:13:05.528]  I don't.
[01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:11.391]  But if it was two white men beating black children and black women, you'd have riots in the streets nationwide.
[01:13:11.411 --> 01:13:12.492]  Well, why don't you have that?
[01:13:12.512 --> 01:13:13.593]  Because it's so rare.
[01:13:15.219 --> 01:13:17.020]  And the crime statistics are there and are a fact.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.723]  A migrant who participated in a 20-man gang rape of a woman tells police it was fun.
[01:13:21.763 --> 01:13:22.643]  Yeah, yeah, pull that one up.
[01:13:25.065 --> 01:13:34.330]  By the way, I watched this beautiful woman being gang raped about a year and a half ago.
[01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:37.111]  We played some of the footage, but blurred it and zoomed in on her face.
[01:13:37.912 --> 01:13:41.334]  And it is so haunting, the blood coming out of her mouth.
[01:13:42.395 --> 01:13:45.097]  And she's being thrust over and over again.
[01:13:45.117 --> 01:13:45.858]  They're hammering her.
[01:13:46.619 --> 01:13:48.660]  And she just is like panicked.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.022]  You sure kind of wake up and struggle and then pass back out.
[01:13:51.082 --> 01:13:53.004]  And she just is like, I can't believe what's happening.
[01:13:53.344 --> 01:13:57.348]  And it's like, it makes me think of my wife or my daughters or my mother or any other women.
[01:13:57.708 --> 01:14:01.531]  And it's just so fundamental that we don't act like that in the West.
[01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:03.653]  This is the West with chivalry.
[01:14:03.993 --> 01:14:05.494]  We're being turned into animals here.
[01:14:06.255 --> 01:14:13.002]  But the media and Hollywood and George Soros and the universities, they tell us we're the place that treats women bad.
[01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:15.425]  Yeah, that's another one I hadn't seen.
[01:14:15.745 --> 01:14:16.506]  There's so many of these.
[01:14:16.746 --> 01:14:17.367]  I can't look at it.
[01:14:17.407 --> 01:14:17.807]  Take it down.
[01:14:21.171 --> 01:14:21.551]  You know what?
[01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:22.172]  Show some of it.
[01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:23.032]  Just don't show the raping.
[01:14:23.753 --> 01:14:26.016]  Because they'll try to censor us and say we're showing inappropriate stuff.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.621]  And by the way, these are popular on leftist sites.
[01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:31.182]  That's not the one I've, there's hundreds of these.
[01:14:31.622 --> 01:14:41.766]  There's one where the woman's held up by the arms and there's a line of guys, 20D, and they are just, I mean, you talk about brutal, savage raping and the police do nothing.
[01:14:42.666 --> 01:14:44.387]  You see that Islamic spay prank right there?
[01:14:47.248 --> 01:14:49.449]  That woman fought so she didn't get raped.
[01:14:49.489 --> 01:14:51.350]  Yeah, that's the only reason that's still online.
[01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:53.470]  That woman fought him.
[01:14:53.811 --> 01:14:54.711]  She didn't make it easy.
[01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.091]  Let me tell you something.
[01:14:57.491 --> 01:14:59.312]  I see 20 guys raping a woman.
[01:14:59.552 --> 01:15:02.594]  I'm not going to say what I'm going to do, but I just can't handle it.
[01:15:02.654 --> 01:15:07.756]  And then I'm told I'm the bad guy by the stinking, disgusting, evil Hollywood crime syndicate.
[01:15:08.516 --> 01:15:09.136]  We're going to break.
[01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:10.597]  I'm going to give the number out when we come back.
[01:15:10.617 --> 01:15:13.098]  I'm going to get in a bunch of video clips of the president, Kanye, and everything else.
[01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:17.540]  They're trying to bully and kick us off the air right now, as you know.
[01:15:17.641 --> 01:15:19.223]  Soros, the Clintons are all suing us.
[01:15:20.104 --> 01:15:23.428]  And it's just, does America know your rights are all under attack?
[01:15:23.448 --> 01:15:24.810]  They're coming for you and your family.
[01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.691]  They mean business.
[01:15:25.711 --> 01:15:29.296]  They mean to blow these borders up and bring an unlimited Islamicist.
[01:15:30.097 --> 01:15:32.278]  Most Austin already looks like Mogadishu or something.
[01:15:32.659 --> 01:15:33.139]  It's sick!
[01:15:33.459 --> 01:15:34.200]  What are you going to do?
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:41.564]  Spread the live links, spread the articles, the videos, please support the local affiliates, TV and radio, and go buy some products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:15:41.924 --> 01:15:52.251]  If just a few percentage of you more go buy great products that everybody needs at InfoWarsTore.com with our state-of-the-art shopping cart system set at Bezos, we'll be able to take that money and fight the globalists.
[01:15:53.462 --> 01:15:54.464]  Bunch of specials in.
[01:15:54.845 --> 01:15:57.049]  A Supermail Vitality X2 and Rainforce.
[01:15:57.069 --> 01:15:59.333]  50% off on the Supermail and others.
[01:15:59.754 --> 01:16:01.097]  Free shipping on some of those items.
[01:16:05.786 --> 01:16:08.287]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[01:16:08.367 --> 01:16:11.428]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[01:16:11.488 --> 01:16:13.769]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[01:16:14.389 --> 01:16:15.870]  What is the latest from the UK?
[01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:24.533]  Look, remember that in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[01:16:24.553 --> 01:16:28.734]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[01:16:28.774 --> 01:16:31.655]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:33.076]  It would have been mad!
[01:16:33.676 --> 01:16:41.380]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.821]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[01:16:44.401 --> 01:16:46.142]  Trust Middle England.
[01:16:46.543 --> 01:16:48.003]  Trust Middle America.
[01:16:48.023 --> 01:16:51.785]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[01:16:52.145 --> 01:16:56.027]  Now, Mrs. May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[01:16:56.587 --> 01:16:57.468]  All I can tell her
[01:16:58.229 --> 01:17:06.839]  is be careful because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[01:17:06.859 --> 01:17:07.920]  Let's put it like this.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:17.311]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago
[01:17:17.791 --> 01:17:23.132]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:36.415]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[01:17:36.455 --> 01:17:38.595]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[01:17:38.735 --> 01:17:39.855]  You're a leading expert on this.
[01:17:39.935 --> 01:17:41.816]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[01:17:42.056 --> 01:17:42.996]  Why are they trying to flood?
[01:17:44.042 --> 01:17:45.202]  Because they hate Christianity.
[01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:56.825]  They deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[01:17:56.865 --> 01:17:57.685]  They deny that.
[01:17:58.125 --> 01:18:01.786]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[01:18:01.846 --> 01:18:03.046]  They want to get rid of it.
[01:18:03.547 --> 01:18:11.488]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[01:18:11.749 --> 01:18:13.549]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[01:18:14.281 --> 01:18:19.483]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[01:18:19.523 --> 01:18:25.545]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[01:18:25.845 --> 01:18:34.128]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:39.911]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[01:18:39.951 --> 01:18:41.111]  And look, what's really happening here?
[01:18:41.611 --> 01:18:43.432]  You know, don't underestimate
[01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:47.015]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[01:18:47.335 --> 01:18:48.396]  The victory of Brexit.
[01:18:48.676 --> 01:18:49.597]  The victory of Trump.
[01:18:50.217 --> 01:18:51.078]  You know, we're winning.
[01:18:51.398 --> 01:18:52.479]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[01:18:52.739 --> 01:19:00.345]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[01:19:00.425 --> 01:19:01.226]  And you know something?
[01:19:01.766 --> 01:19:02.567]  If we can resist,
[01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:12.491]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:14.252]  So don't get down, everybody.
[01:19:14.553 --> 01:19:15.413]  Don't get depressed.
[01:19:15.754 --> 01:19:18.236]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[01:19:19.079 --> 01:19:27.026]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came in privately, cheered him up and cheered up the troops, and you were a critical catalyst in this.
[01:19:27.046 --> 01:19:27.967]  This is you were in Brexit.
[01:19:28.247 --> 01:19:28.907]  You're amazing.
[01:19:29.128 --> 01:19:29.828]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:19:29.888 --> 01:19:30.689]  I know you're very busy.
[01:19:31.269 --> 01:19:32.631]  But that's as the EU has said.
[01:19:32.671 --> 01:19:35.153]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[01:19:35.193 --> 01:19:38.576]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:52.466]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[01:19:52.826 --> 01:19:58.308]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must protect it.
[01:19:58.788 --> 01:20:00.129]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[01:20:06.886 --> 01:20:23.014]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.876 --> 01:20:32.139]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.931 --> 01:20:38.555]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a major global political realignment taking place.
[01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:43.839]  Trump is being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by the South Korean president.
[01:20:43.879 --> 01:20:44.779]  That broke today.
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.401]  They're agreeing to a peace deal.
[01:20:46.901 --> 01:20:52.605]  You've got the Pope calling for everyone to turn in their firearms, but the UN and the globalists, and he won't give up the Swiss Guard.
[01:20:52.866 --> 01:20:56.549]  But a global peace race has begun, launched by President Trump.
[01:20:56.669 --> 01:21:00.131]  Meanwhile, in Tehran, the dictators there,
[01:21:01.345 --> 01:21:05.067]  The Ayatollahs are about to start testing atomic bombs.
[01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:08.049]  The word is they had atomic weapons a long time ago.
[01:21:08.069 --> 01:21:12.171]  Now they've got the delivery systems, and I have that from very high-level sources.
[01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:25.017]  But here is Benjamin Netanyahu live, giving a breakdown from Tel Aviv, ladies and gentlemen, about the fact that they're getting ready to go after Iran.
[01:21:25.057 --> 01:21:25.518]  Here it is.
[01:21:25.598 --> 01:21:28.339]  Fundamental religious and ethical convictions.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.261]  This is repeated by Iran's Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif.
[01:21:33.941 --> 01:21:36.522]  We didn't have any program to develop nuclear weapons.
[01:21:36.582 --> 01:21:40.904]  Anyway, we consider nuclear weapons both irrational as well as immoral.
[01:21:42.204 --> 01:21:44.305]  Well, tonight I'm here to tell you one thing.
[01:21:45.525 --> 01:21:46.766]  Iran lied.
[01:21:48.787 --> 01:21:49.227]  Big time.
[01:21:50.807 --> 01:21:58.170]  After signing the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran intensified its efforts to hide its secret nuclear files.
[01:22:00.157 --> 01:22:07.519]  In 2017, Iran moved its nuclear weapons files to a highly secret location in Tehran.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.601]  This is the Shorabad district in southern Tehran.
[01:22:12.041 --> 01:22:13.922]  This is where they kept the atomic archives.
[01:22:14.642 --> 01:22:15.002]  Right here.
[01:22:16.863 --> 01:22:18.763]  Few Iranians knew where it was.
[01:22:20.524 --> 01:22:21.004]  Very few.
[01:22:22.805 --> 01:22:23.885]  And also a few Israelis.
[01:22:25.446 --> 01:22:26.546]  Now, from the outside,
[01:22:27.827 --> 01:22:29.688]  This was an innocent-looking compound.
[01:22:30.048 --> 01:22:31.708]  It looks like a dilapidated warehouse.
[01:22:32.869 --> 01:22:39.391]  But from the inside, it contained Iran's secret atomic archives locked in massive files.
[01:22:40.271 --> 01:22:41.472]  Actually, they're a little bigger than this.
[01:22:41.732 --> 01:22:41.992]  Okay?
[01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:52.976]  A few weeks ago, in a great intelligence achievement, Israel obtained half a ton of the material inside these vaults.
[01:22:55.197 --> 01:22:55.997]  And here's what we got.
[01:23:00.158 --> 01:23:01.058]  55,000 pages.
[01:23:05.642 --> 01:23:11.026]  Another 55,000 files on 183 CDs.
[01:23:13.548 --> 01:23:19.713]  Everything you're about to see is an exact copy of the original Iranian material.
[01:23:22.335 --> 01:23:23.857]  You may want to know where are the originals?
[01:23:25.338 --> 01:23:27.740]  Well, I can say they're now in a very safe place.
[01:23:29.349 --> 01:23:30.569]  Here's what the files included.
[01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:47.876]  Incriminating documents, incriminating charts, incriminating presentations, incriminating blueprints, incriminating photos, incriminating videos, and more.
[01:23:49.476 --> 01:23:56.079]  We've shared this material with the United States, and the United States can vouch for its authenticity.
[01:23:57.250 --> 01:24:03.355]  We will also share it with other countries and we'll share it with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
[01:24:04.676 --> 01:24:06.357]  So let me tell you the history of this material.
[01:24:07.958 --> 01:24:13.643]  We've known for years that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program called Project Ahmad.
[01:24:14.824 --> 01:24:24.151]  We can now prove that Project Ahmad was a comprehensive program to design, build, and test nuclear weapons.
[01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:26.153]  We can also prove
[01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:35.557]  That Iran is secretly storing Project Ahmad material to use at a time of its choice to develop nuclear weapons.
[01:24:37.919 --> 01:24:40.381]  Here's what Project Ahmad's explicit goal was.
[01:24:41.001 --> 01:24:42.723]  Creating nuclear weapons.
[01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:46.586]  This is an original Iranian presentation from these files.
[01:24:47.967 --> 01:24:49.168]  And here's the mission statement.
[01:24:50.254 --> 01:24:59.961]  Design, produce and test five warheads, each with 10 kiloton TNT yield for integration on a missile.
[01:25:01.442 --> 01:25:06.666]  You don't have to read Farsi to see 10 kilotons here, TNT.
[01:25:09.288 --> 01:25:12.190]  This is the specific goal of Project Ahmad.
[01:25:14.131 --> 01:25:18.975]  That's like five Hiroshima bombs to be put on ballistic missiles.
[01:25:22.139 --> 01:25:27.344]  This is an original Iranian spreadsheet from the archives of Project Ahmad.
[01:25:28.025 --> 01:25:28.926]  Look at what it has here.
[01:25:29.747 --> 01:25:33.110]  Yellow cake production, centrifuge enrichment process.
[01:25:34.071 --> 01:25:38.272]  Warhead Project, Simulation Project, and Test.
[01:25:39.453 --> 01:25:52.517]  And indeed, when we analyzed what's in these archives, we found that Project Ahmad had all the five elements, the five key elements of a nuclear weapons program.
[01:25:53.717 --> 01:25:54.858]  I want to take them one by one.
[01:25:56.038 --> 01:25:58.919]  First element is designing nuclear weapons.
[01:25:59.819 --> 01:26:02.100]  This is an original Iranian illustration
[01:26:03.058 --> 01:26:03.578]  of a weapon.
[01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:07.781]  Again, you don't have to read Farsi to understand this.
[01:26:08.501 --> 01:26:12.763]  This is U-235, that's enriched uranium, right here at the core.
[01:26:14.364 --> 01:26:18.107]  That's the only place where you find in the core enriched uranium.
[01:26:19.067 --> 01:26:25.251]  And here's an Iranian simulation, original Iranian simulation, putting all these components together.
[01:26:26.691 --> 01:26:27.692]  That's the first component.
[01:26:28.951 --> 01:26:29.712]  Second component.
[01:26:30.292 --> 01:26:31.693]  Developing nuclear cores.
[01:26:32.533 --> 01:26:39.377]  Here's a photo showing the casting process and a cast metal core from the archives.
[01:26:42.599 --> 01:26:48.303]  And here's a secret underground facility the Iranians were building to produce nuclear cores.
[01:26:48.863 --> 01:26:51.685]  We have hundreds of documents for each of these components.
[01:26:52.806 --> 01:26:53.466]  Third component.
[01:26:54.562 --> 01:26:56.243]  Building nuclear implosion systems.
[01:26:56.864 --> 01:27:00.266]  This is an original Iranian photo of a measuring device.
[01:27:00.346 --> 01:27:02.828]  Well, I guarantee you a lot of spies died getting this stuff.
[01:27:02.868 --> 01:27:06.091]  And here's a simulation of a nuclear implosion.
[01:27:08.793 --> 01:27:09.433]  Fourth element.
[01:27:11.475 --> 01:27:12.716]  Preparing nuclear tests.
[01:27:13.596 --> 01:27:18.220]  Here's a map of five potential locations for a nuclear test in Eastern Iran.
[01:27:19.981 --> 01:27:22.023]  One, two, three, four, five.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.061]  He's still briefing, but we can pause it, obviously, and come back.
[01:27:28.781 --> 01:27:29.581]  This is very important.
[01:27:29.601 --> 01:27:30.901]  This has got sprung on the world.
[01:27:31.401 --> 01:27:33.082]  Netanyahu's giving a worldwide press conference.
[01:27:33.102 --> 01:27:33.542]  And here's the deal.
[01:27:33.662 --> 01:27:35.822]  Iran said they weren't developing a nuclear weapon.
[01:27:36.962 --> 01:27:37.823]  Then they did this deal.
[01:27:37.883 --> 01:27:38.723]  We all know they are.
[01:27:39.283 --> 01:27:43.644]  I've been told by high-level sources a decade ago they already had some, but they didn't have delivery systems.
[01:27:44.864 --> 01:27:46.644]  Pakistan obviously has over 100.
[01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:50.945]  And the point is, is that Trump's trying to get peace through strength.
[01:27:52.008 --> 01:27:57.353]  You've got Saudi Arabia and Israel now lined up and ready to support a strike on Iran.
[01:27:59.434 --> 01:28:00.956]  And so that's the issue here.
[01:28:01.116 --> 01:28:02.377]  I don't want to have war with Iran.
[01:28:04.539 --> 01:28:06.120]  But they're very aggressive to our ships.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:06.941]  They're very aggressive.
[01:28:06.961 --> 01:28:08.422]  Their people don't like the leadership.
[01:28:08.442 --> 01:28:10.524]  Most of their population is young.
[01:28:10.584 --> 01:28:11.665]  The mullahs are out of control.
[01:28:14.013 --> 01:28:18.195]  And Israel will end up moving against that country if they think they get delivery systems.
[01:28:18.235 --> 01:28:24.757]  And that's what Netanyahu undoubtedly will come back with, is the delivery systems after the testing phase on the other side.
[01:28:24.817 --> 01:28:27.939]  But regardless of what you think of this, this is where the world is.
[01:28:28.699 --> 01:28:34.921]  And appeasement got North Korea out of control, firing missiles at Hawaii to test them.
[01:28:36.002 --> 01:28:37.622]  Getting in their face got them to do a peace deal.
[01:28:38.203 --> 01:28:39.943]  What is Netanyahu trying to do here?
[01:28:40.244 --> 01:28:41.904]  Push Iran to the peace table?
[01:28:42.344 --> 01:28:43.345]  I hope that's the point.
[01:28:44.355 --> 01:28:48.978]  Because one way or another, the world is in a great crisis right now.
[01:28:49.538 --> 01:28:52.160]  We'll be back more with this big briefing.
[01:28:52.721 --> 01:28:56.383]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:28:56.663 --> 01:28:58.004]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:28:58.604 --> 01:28:59.145]  Stay with us.

[01:29:49.378 --> 01:29:52.001]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.
[01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:55.564]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[01:29:55.864 --> 01:30:00.789]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:00.869 --> 01:30:02.751]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:09.235]  This lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment right to free speech.
[01:30:09.735 --> 01:30:19.761]  It isn't just about myself, but it's about every single American who exercises their right to say what they think about what they see reported in the media and by the government.
[01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:24.243]  If Mr. Gilmour wins, Brennan Gilmour, we will lose that right.
[01:30:24.603 --> 01:30:25.504]  If Soros wins,
[01:30:26.144 --> 01:30:37.309]  The literal Nazi collaborator that has overthrown all these other countries, if he wins with all his paychecks he sends out, then this will be the repeal of the First Amendment by fiat.
[01:30:37.489 --> 01:30:46.633]  What it is is propaganda, 50, 60, 70, 80 page filings that then defame myself, the First Amendment, President Trump, you name it.
[01:30:47.013 --> 01:30:51.455]  Where they just say all these horrible things that aren't true, things that we never said knowing
[01:30:51.875 --> 01:30:55.560]  That they are protected in defamation inside the court.
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:31:04.531]  The dying corporate media then picks it up and goes out and puts it out as gospel and then calls for InfoWars as a precedent-setting case to be deplatformed.
[01:31:04.551 --> 01:31:05.492]  So, they've told us.
[01:31:06.618 --> 01:31:13.605]  We don't like you putting out different talking points, different ideas than what the Soros Democratic Party funded media wants.
[01:31:13.885 --> 01:31:15.467]  And that's the real sin of Infowars.
[01:31:15.507 --> 01:31:19.271]  This really is an attack on the First Amendment.
[01:31:19.651 --> 01:31:21.933]  And if that falls, everything else falls.
[01:31:22.094 --> 01:31:23.195]  That's not just rhetoric.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.501]  That they're trying to overturn the First Amendment.
[01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:27.101]  My God.
[01:31:27.461 --> 01:31:28.422]  This is like Orwellian.
[01:31:28.462 --> 01:31:29.342]  I'm force-fed.
[01:31:29.702 --> 01:31:33.364]  I'm trying to eat a steak at Trump Tower and I got damn CNN looking down on me.
[01:31:33.804 --> 01:31:35.485]  And then if I'm in the airport, there it is.
[01:31:35.885 --> 01:31:40.387]  And a lot of restaurants, you walk in the bathroom and there's Anderson Cooper looking down at your ding-ding.
[01:31:40.887 --> 01:31:43.448]  And it's like, can I just get these people out of my life?
[01:31:44.048 --> 01:31:45.289]  I don't want to censor them.
[01:31:45.729 --> 01:31:46.629]  I don't want to shut them down.
[01:31:46.649 --> 01:31:47.710]  I don't want to put them in prison.
[01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:49.890]  I just want to be able to change the channel.
[01:31:50.051 --> 01:31:50.671]  But I can't!
[01:31:51.491 --> 01:31:53.432]  Instead, it's every night on CNN.
[01:31:53.732 --> 01:31:55.192]  Roger Stone's a Russian-Asian.
[01:31:55.272 --> 01:31:56.893]  Alex Jones is a criminal demon.
[01:31:57.713 --> 01:32:02.174]  You know, George Soros never... George Soros was a Holocaust survivor and battled the Nazis.
[01:32:02.554 --> 01:32:03.935]  Alex Jones says he helped him.
[01:32:04.135 --> 01:32:05.555]  No, he said it on 60 Minutes!
[01:32:06.136 --> 01:32:09.897]  And that's why Soros has a hit out on my free speech.
[01:32:10.297 --> 01:32:13.638]  Specifically because he doesn't want me to say that he said he...
[01:32:14.378 --> 01:32:16.380]  Had the best time of his life rounding up Jews.
[01:32:16.981 --> 01:32:17.981]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:32:18.202 --> 01:32:19.863]  The best time in his life?
[01:32:20.144 --> 01:32:21.465]  I quite enjoyed it.
[01:32:21.945 --> 01:32:23.206]  Smiling like a demon?
[01:32:23.427 --> 01:32:24.768]  Talk about psycho world!
[01:32:25.028 --> 01:32:25.669]  So I want to say this.
[01:32:25.789 --> 01:32:27.150]  I apologize to George Soros.
[01:32:28.031 --> 01:32:30.193]  He actually went in on the D-Day invasion of Normandy.
[01:32:30.353 --> 01:32:33.296]  He personally killed 5,000 Nazis and severed Hitler's head.
[01:32:33.576 --> 01:32:39.379]  I want to kneel to Soros and say, Your Lordship, you are a hero that killed Hitler.
[01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:39.859]  There.
[01:32:39.879 --> 01:32:40.979]  They'll probably put that out.
[01:32:41.199 --> 01:32:41.780]  Anderson Cooper.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.041]  Jones admits tonight that it was actually George Soros.
[01:32:44.281 --> 01:32:55.406]  And here's hidden film footage of the OSS head from World War II as he fights 400 SS officers who had actually turned into werewolves and then severs the head of Adolf Hitler.
[01:32:55.866 --> 01:32:56.746]  So, that's the truth.
[01:32:56.947 --> 01:32:58.027]  Soros killed Hitler.
[01:32:58.407 --> 01:32:59.688]  So, hail Soros.
[01:33:06.326 --> 01:33:10.849]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.473 --> 01:33:19.095]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:36.161 --> 01:33:40.885]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:44.428 --> 01:34:02.865]  Well, as we speak, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sits on top of a giant hydrogen bomb nuke arsenal of cruise missiles, ICBMs, submarine launch, launch by aircraft, cruise missiles, you name it, is laying out shocking
[01:34:04.562 --> 01:34:10.863]  Amounts of evidence of Iran's secret nuclear weapons program that they say they've given up for many years.
[01:34:12.264 --> 01:34:16.325]  Now, he's showing right now documents from a decade ago.
[01:34:17.225 --> 01:34:22.006]  But he's pointing out that it's all hidden in underground bases and warehouses ready to roll out.
[01:34:23.166 --> 01:34:29.367]  I have talked years ago to very good sources, who let's just say have been in the military 30 years, you name it, they said no.
[01:34:29.868 --> 01:34:31.628]  They've seen the scans.
[01:34:32.915 --> 01:34:47.560]  With the satellites and aircraft that can see down into the ground and that they have a lot of concentrated fissile material and the ability to build atomic bombs.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.961]  Atomic bombs are not that hard to build once you've got the material.
[01:34:52.065 --> 01:34:53.586]  And of course, Pakistan's got hundreds.
[01:34:53.626 --> 01:34:55.127]  This is all a very serious situation.
[01:34:56.188 --> 01:35:00.010]  The larger issue here is, is Israel going to strike Iran?
[01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:01.911]  Well, they've got Saudi Arabia lined up to do it.
[01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:07.334]  And Saudi Arabia has been hinting that they've got nuclear weapons now, which I've been told they've had for a decade.
[01:35:07.374 --> 01:35:13.298]  They said, listen, if they're going to have it, we're going to have it.
[01:35:13.358 --> 01:35:17.821]  And the word is, Israel's been transferring more advanced delivery systems now to
[01:35:20.598 --> 01:35:21.319]  Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:21.379 --> 01:35:22.480]  So, think about that.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:27.764]  The Saudi Arabian Muslims, who are over 80% of Islam, they control it.
[01:35:27.804 --> 01:35:28.484]  They control Mecca.
[01:35:29.785 --> 01:35:31.447]  They reportedly have nuclear weapons.
[01:35:31.587 --> 01:35:34.209]  And so, if you're a radio listener, it's Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.
[01:35:34.249 --> 01:35:35.070]  It's night time over there.
[01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:36.010]  It's like, you know, 8.30.
[01:35:36.811 --> 01:35:38.853]  With huge weapons banks.
[01:35:38.873 --> 01:35:44.617]  I mean, huge banks of folders and CDs going through the evidence.
[01:35:44.637 --> 01:35:45.178]  This isn't like
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:52.022]  A little fake thing with WMDs and Colin Powell holds up a little vial of anthrax at the UN.
[01:35:53.243 --> 01:35:54.543]  We knew that intelligence was fake.
[01:35:54.983 --> 01:35:57.204]  My intel has been Iran's got nukes.
[01:35:57.225 --> 01:36:00.786]  So I don't know what Israel's thinking, but I haven't seen the whole press conference yet.
[01:36:00.846 --> 01:36:02.067]  It's still going on, but we paused it.
[01:36:02.687 --> 01:36:08.670]  I'm going to guess he's going to get into delivery systems, and that's why he's really concerned, because the truth is just like Israel doesn't say they have nukes.
[01:36:10.057 --> 01:36:10.937]  Iran's got them too.
[01:36:11.238 --> 01:36:13.178]  They're getting upset about the delivery systems.
[01:36:13.499 --> 01:36:14.819]  Let's see if I'm right.
[01:36:15.759 --> 01:36:18.821]  Let's go back to the press conference.
[01:36:19.741 --> 01:36:24.343]  Here's a map of five potential locations for a nuclear test in Eastern Iran.
[01:36:26.124 --> 01:36:28.205]  One, two, three, four, five.
[01:36:29.986 --> 01:36:32.687]  We have many, many more such documents.
[01:36:33.767 --> 01:36:37.609]  And fifth, integrating nuclear weapons on missiles.
[01:36:38.948 --> 01:36:43.051]  Here's a design for a nuclear payload on a Shahab-3 missile from the archive.
[01:36:47.113 --> 01:36:47.834]  Here's the warhead.
[01:36:49.395 --> 01:36:49.915]  Here's the bomb.
[01:36:53.918 --> 01:37:00.542]  And I don't have to remind you, I think, that Iran is continually expanding the range of its ballistic missiles, its nuclear-capable missiles.
[01:37:00.982 --> 01:37:02.603]  They started with 1,000 kilometers.
[01:37:03.604 --> 01:37:05.445]  They're now up to 2,000, roughly.
[01:37:06.425 --> 01:37:06.946]  They can reach
[01:37:08.314 --> 01:37:16.576]  Riyadh, Tel Aviv, Moscow, but they're working on far, far greater ranges.
[01:37:16.796 --> 01:37:22.458]  They're planning much longer range missiles to carry nuclear weapons.
[01:37:23.438 --> 01:37:33.921]  So these files conclusively prove that Iran is brazenly lying when it says it never had a nuclear weapons program.
[01:37:39.289 --> 01:37:40.170]  The files prove that.
[01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:42.371]  But here's what happened next.
[01:37:43.772 --> 01:37:45.733]  Iran was faced with mounting pressure in 2003.
[01:37:45.773 --> 01:37:47.515]  You remember that.
[01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:48.815]  That was following the Gulf War.
[01:37:49.416 --> 01:37:51.577]  So it was forced to shell Project Ahmad.
[01:37:52.538 --> 01:37:54.559]  But it didn't show its nuclear ambitions.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.342]  So Iran devised a plan to do two things.
[01:37:59.282 --> 01:38:02.244]  First, to preserve the nuclear know-how from Project Ahmad.
[01:38:03.125 --> 01:38:07.328]  And second, to further develop its nuclear weapons-related capabilities.
[01:38:08.411 --> 01:38:11.612]  That plan came directly from Iran's top leadership.
[01:38:12.512 --> 01:38:14.573]  Here's another document from the archive.
[01:38:15.793 --> 01:38:20.254]  This is following the new directive of Iran's Minister of Defense, Mr. Shamkhani.
[01:38:21.175 --> 01:38:23.975]  Today he's the Director of the National Security Council.
[01:38:25.156 --> 01:38:31.357]  Following the new directive of Iran's Minister of Defense, the work would be split into two parts.
[01:38:31.758 --> 01:38:33.278]  Covert and overt.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:40.024]  A key part of the plan was to form new organizations to continue the work.
[01:38:40.505 --> 01:38:44.769]  This is how Dr. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of Project Ahmad, put it.
[01:38:44.829 --> 01:38:46.311]  Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh.
[01:38:47.071 --> 01:38:48.192]  So here's his directive.
[01:38:48.333 --> 01:38:48.793]  It's right here.
[01:38:50.355 --> 01:38:59.223]  And he says, the general aim is to announce the closure of Project Ahmad, but then he adds, special activities
[01:39:00.063 --> 01:39:00.704]  You know what that is.
[01:39:01.384 --> 01:39:06.630]  Special activities will be carried out under the title of scientific know-how developments.
[01:39:08.372 --> 01:39:13.197]  And in fact, this is exactly what Iran proceeded to do.
[01:39:13.677 --> 01:39:18.022]  It continued this work in a series of organizations over the years.
[01:39:20.894 --> 01:39:26.139]  And today, in 2010, or 2018, this work is carried out by Sapand.
[01:39:26.299 --> 01:39:29.742]  That's an organization inside Iran's Defense Ministry.
[01:39:30.763 --> 01:39:38.070]  And you will not be surprised to hear that Sapand is led by the same person who led Project Ahmad, Dr. Fakhrizadeh.
[01:39:38.851 --> 01:39:45.818]  And also, not coincidentally, many of Sapand's key personnel worked under Fakhrizadeh on Project Ahmad.
[01:39:47.165 --> 01:40:01.149]  So this atomic archive clearly shows that Iran planned at the highest levels to continue work related to nuclear weapons under different guises and using the same personnel.
[01:40:02.869 --> 01:40:10.932]  I want to give you another example of Iran's nuclear weapons related activities that continued after Project Ahmad.
[01:40:12.572 --> 01:40:14.893]  You all remember the Fordow facility?
[01:40:15.902 --> 01:40:16.402]  Can you show that?
[01:40:17.203 --> 01:40:19.525]  Fordow uranium enrichment facility.
[01:40:19.985 --> 01:40:25.309]  This was a secret underground enrichment facility that the Iranians built under a mountain.
[01:40:27.423 --> 01:40:33.004]  You don't put thousands of centrifuges under a mountain to produce medical isotopes.
[01:40:33.584 --> 01:40:35.325]  You put them there for one reason.
[01:40:36.425 --> 01:40:37.105]  Nuclear weapons.
[01:40:37.926 --> 01:40:39.446]  Enrichment for nuclear weapons.
[01:40:40.106 --> 01:40:48.428]  But the files show that Fordow was designed from the get-go for nuclear weapons as part of Project Ahmad.
[01:40:48.948 --> 01:40:53.409]  Here's an original Iranian blueprint of Fordow.
[01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:56.170]  And what happened?
[01:40:57.367 --> 01:41:10.254]  Okay, I was going to take calls this hour, and I was going to get another news, but this is obviously breaking, this is big, because here's the issue.
[01:41:11.395 --> 01:41:21.960]  Whether you love Israel, or hate Israel, or are neutral on Israel, pragmatic on Israel like I am, this is the build-up to major war you're watching.
[01:41:22.301 --> 01:41:26.603]  The Saudi prince over here, the round-up of the jihadis that were leading Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:30.229]  The civil war in Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:32.991]  Now Saudi Arabia wanting us to kick Assad out.
[01:41:33.031 --> 01:41:33.851]  That's part of the deal.
[01:41:34.972 --> 01:41:40.394]  That they'll denuclearize and they'll stop funding jihad if we knock out their enemies.
[01:41:40.434 --> 01:41:54.902]  Now of course it's going to be a double cross because the globalists, the globalists ladies and gentlemen, they are fomenting all over the world in every way they can, at every point,
[01:41:55.888 --> 01:41:58.830]  And every civilization that puts up with this ends up falling.
[01:41:59.631 --> 01:42:09.099]  The globalists are fomenting a operation to overrun Europe and collapse it and implode it.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.041]  And to basically end Christianity as we know it.
[01:42:12.482 --> 01:42:15.985]  So there's double dealing from the very tops of the whole global government system.
[01:42:17.304 --> 01:42:44.698]  Down into Saudi Arabia and into Israel and into all these different organizations and groups to create the class of civilization, to overthrow non-radical Muslim countries, and then to break down Europe's borders, merge Islam with the West, bring in a huge clash of culture, and then bring in a worldwide peacekeeper government to stop the cultural and financial ruin that this forced integration of Islam into the West is going to cause.
[01:42:45.238 --> 01:42:45.818]  So that's the thing.
[01:42:45.858 --> 01:42:46.779]  I'm not anti-Israel.
[01:42:48.237 --> 01:43:01.250]  But at the same time, this whole clash with Iran is simply about a war between the Shiites and the Sunnis, a civil war to knock out the rival arm of Islam so that then the main Islamic force can march against Europe and Russia.
[01:43:05.168 --> 01:43:07.009]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[01:43:07.049 --> 01:43:07.350]  Go ahead.
[01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:11.353]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[01:43:11.493 --> 01:43:16.497]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[01:43:16.517 --> 01:43:22.381]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[01:43:23.442 --> 01:43:31.708]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[01:43:32.469 --> 01:43:35.251]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[01:43:35.931 --> 01:43:39.554]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[01:43:39.674 --> 01:43:41.736]  I use your winter sun, your selenium.
[01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:43.918]  The real red pill.
[01:43:44.238 --> 01:43:45.739]  Your bio PCA.
[01:43:45.859 --> 01:43:46.500]  Immunewall.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.102]  I'm just here in California fighting.
[01:43:49.382 --> 01:43:51.304]  Trying to survive with the demon rats.
[01:43:51.724 --> 01:43:53.485]  How they're demonizing my state.
[01:43:53.545 --> 01:43:55.007]  I just can't stand it anymore.
[01:43:55.687 --> 01:43:57.068]  You have changed my life.
[01:43:57.168 --> 01:43:59.951]  InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[01:44:00.471 --> 01:44:03.013]  I bought property in a no-fly zone.
[01:44:03.053 --> 01:44:04.334]  No cell phone service.
[01:44:04.715 --> 01:44:06.036]  Got my own well water.
[01:44:06.116 --> 01:44:09.138]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on.
[01:44:09.178 --> 01:44:10.619]  But I need to know what else we can do.
[01:44:11.476 --> 01:44:12.797]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[01:44:12.977 --> 01:44:18.302]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[01:44:18.322 --> 01:44:19.623]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[01:44:19.643 --> 01:44:19.843]  Yeah.
[01:44:20.003 --> 01:44:21.865]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[01:44:21.905 --> 01:44:22.746]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[01:44:22.786 --> 01:44:24.467]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[01:44:24.487 --> 01:44:25.448]  We really appreciate you.
[01:44:25.528 --> 01:44:26.509]  Keep up the fight.
[01:44:26.549 --> 01:44:27.970]  We need to take California back.
[01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.370]  Thank you, Desiree.
[01:44:28.410 --> 01:44:29.451]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[01:44:29.511 --> 01:44:30.092]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[01:44:34.964 --> 01:44:46.808]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[01:44:47.468 --> 01:44:56.771]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[01:44:56.991 --> 01:45:01.813]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[01:45:02.313 --> 01:45:11.617]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[01:45:12.478 --> 01:45:17.200]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:18.701]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[01:45:19.321 --> 01:45:25.628]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:26.510]  Here's my problem.
[01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:35.440]  When I do take the bodies and the X2 and things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:36.962]  I have the same issue.
[01:45:37.222 --> 01:45:37.362]  Yeah.
[01:45:37.802 --> 01:45:39.263]  Neurological disorders are exploding.
[01:45:39.623 --> 01:45:40.543]  IQs are dropping.
[01:45:40.623 --> 01:45:41.943]  People are in trance-like states.
[01:45:42.283 --> 01:45:44.384]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:47.525]  And I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[01:45:47.705 --> 01:45:49.085]  It's 25% off.
[01:45:49.185 --> 01:45:51.246]  And this has a 95 percuminin level.
[01:45:51.526 --> 01:45:52.966]  We went out with the top labs.
[01:45:52.986 --> 01:45:55.487]  We said we want the strongest concentrate.
[01:45:56.167 --> 01:46:03.112]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[01:46:17.043 --> 01:46:22.147]  Your product is an extract, and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[01:46:22.368 --> 01:46:26.871]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[01:46:27.452 --> 01:46:30.675]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[01:46:30.995 --> 01:46:36.420]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.520]  Well, that's another reason.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:38.121]  It's left behind.
[01:46:38.301 --> 01:46:42.925]  The top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways.
[01:46:43.005 --> 01:46:43.125]  Yes.
[01:46:43.145 --> 01:46:45.167]  Because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[01:46:45.307 --> 01:46:45.707]  Exactly.
[01:46:45.847 --> 01:46:52.730]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[01:46:53.031 --> 01:46:57.593]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[01:47:06.237 --> 01:47:08.838]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.633 --> 01:47:24.834]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:47:25.415 --> 01:47:31.479]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.519 --> 01:47:37.204]  We're about to go to the in-depth historic briefing with real secret documents, real secret
[01:47:38.044 --> 01:47:42.168]  Graphics, videos, four atomic weapons, which I've studied.
[01:47:42.288 --> 01:47:42.949]  These are real.
[01:47:43.429 --> 01:47:43.810]  I ran.
[01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:45.291]  I know it had a program.
[01:47:45.351 --> 01:47:46.653]  They didn't deny the program.
[01:47:47.033 --> 01:47:47.814]  They're ongoing.
[01:47:48.715 --> 01:47:52.198]  I've talked to the folks that have seen the satellite scans.
[01:47:53.079 --> 01:47:55.842]  They had five weapons, as you see in this report.
[01:47:55.882 --> 01:47:59.205]  Man, I was told stuff by folks ten years ago that was dead on.
[01:47:59.666 --> 01:48:01.327]  Five weapons a decade ago.
[01:48:02.268 --> 01:48:03.948]  And they're going for delivery systems.
[01:48:04.088 --> 01:48:06.049]  And forget which side you're on.
[01:48:06.489 --> 01:48:07.869]  I'm on the side of not having nuclear war.
[01:48:08.429 --> 01:48:09.190]  I'm on the side of peace.
[01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:18.652]  For young people in Iran, young people in Israel, young people in Russia, young people in Germany, young people in Brazil, young people in Canada, young people in America.
[01:48:20.112 --> 01:48:22.392]  But Iran is its own wild-eyed tyranny.
[01:48:23.153 --> 01:48:25.493]  They are the Shiite Muslims, 19% of Islam.
[01:48:25.813 --> 01:48:28.894]  They're at war with Sunni Islam, Saudi Arabia.
[01:48:29.690 --> 01:48:34.835]  The two are at each other's throats between Hezbollah and Hamas and their proxy wars.
[01:48:34.915 --> 01:48:35.876]  It's all out of control.
[01:48:37.258 --> 01:48:44.224]  But the globalists are allied with Saudi Arabia, and after they take out Iran, they're going to implode the borders of Europe and flood Europe even more.
[01:48:44.785 --> 01:48:49.149]  I'm not saying I'm on any of these sides, because this is all insane.
[01:48:50.591 --> 01:48:51.492]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:48:52.426 --> 01:48:56.028]  Netanyahu is preparing and selling a strike on Iran.
[01:48:56.609 --> 01:49:01.292]  And that's why they've been in all these secret meetings with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.
[01:49:01.712 --> 01:49:03.813]  That's why he's been on this goodwill tour over here.
[01:49:04.193 --> 01:49:06.255]  That's why you've seen the push to strike Syria.
[01:49:07.496 --> 01:49:11.178]  That's why the Russians announced a month and a half ago, we're getting 100% out.
[01:49:11.718 --> 01:49:13.499]  We went in, we stabilized it, boom.
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:17.222]  That's why North Korea is saying, okay, we want a peace deal.
[01:49:17.882 --> 01:49:20.604]  Because the word is, the United States, Israel and others,
[01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:24.791]  Are getting ready to strike Iran.
[01:49:25.351 --> 01:49:31.834]  And Iran's been saying, we'll blow up your ships, we'll attack you, if you don't give us a peace deal, if you back out of your agreement with us.
[01:49:31.874 --> 01:49:32.955]  That is not helping.
[01:49:33.475 --> 01:49:35.136]  Because this isn't the old days with Obama.
[01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:37.216]  Who's a little jihadi.
[01:49:38.677 --> 01:49:39.958]  And who's working with Saudi Arabia.
[01:49:40.018 --> 01:49:41.358]  This is Trump.
[01:49:42.219 --> 01:49:43.419]  And Trump's very pragmatic.
[01:49:43.439 --> 01:49:44.760]  He wants all these wars to stop.
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.340]  He wants all this garbage to stop.
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:48.660]  Here's the deal.
[01:49:49.321 --> 01:49:53.864]  Israel's been caught working with Al-Qaeda and ISIS, just like our government did under Obama.
[01:49:54.104 --> 01:49:55.124]  Netanyahu knows that.
[01:49:55.545 --> 01:49:56.625]  I'm not attacking Netanyahu.
[01:49:56.685 --> 01:49:57.166]  It's a fact.
[01:49:57.526 --> 01:50:02.349]  Because that was the enemy of Hezbollah, which is the Iranian-backed militia.
[01:50:02.909 --> 01:50:03.970]  That's the way these wars work.
[01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:05.831]  We shouldn't be Machiavelli.
[01:50:06.191 --> 01:50:09.953]  We shouldn't back anybody that's evil, even if they're fighting somebody else that's bad.
[01:50:10.334 --> 01:50:11.915]  That's Arabic thinking.
[01:50:12.555 --> 01:50:14.756]  Muslim thinking of the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[01:50:15.117 --> 01:50:15.257]  No!
[01:50:16.770 --> 01:50:18.331]  No, that's not chivalrous.
[01:50:18.351 --> 01:50:19.852]  That's not what made the West powerful.
[01:50:20.092 --> 01:50:20.932]  We need to get away from that.
[01:50:21.053 --> 01:50:24.354]  But, Iran has been threatening to blow up Israel.
[01:50:24.675 --> 01:50:26.496]  And Iran does have the missiles to hit Israel.
[01:50:27.076 --> 01:50:28.017]  And they've already got nukes.
[01:50:28.237 --> 01:50:30.998]  So this is preparation for attacks on Iran.
[01:50:31.759 --> 01:50:33.099]  Maybe they're trying to push them to the table.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.760]  The old deal is a bad deal.
[01:50:35.221 --> 01:50:35.961]  They did lie.
[01:50:36.121 --> 01:50:37.002]  I'm not calling for war.
[01:50:37.202 --> 01:50:39.163]  But Netanyahu, I know the whole history of this.
[01:50:39.483 --> 01:50:41.264]  This isn't fake WMDs in Iraq.
[01:50:41.845 --> 01:50:42.445]  This is real.
[01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:44.338]  This is real.
[01:50:44.918 --> 01:50:46.079]  Iraq was horrible and evil.
[01:50:46.099 --> 01:50:46.920]  He was our ally.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.181]  He fought the Iranians.
[01:50:48.582 --> 01:50:49.863]  Killed a couple million of them.
[01:50:50.523 --> 01:50:51.484]  We set Saddam up.
[01:50:51.544 --> 01:50:52.025]  It's horrible.
[01:50:53.186 --> 01:50:55.148]  And again, part of a program of destabilization.
[01:50:56.009 --> 01:51:02.415]  Now we're sitting there down to the final program that Wesley Clark talked about when he laid out the seven countries they wanted to take out.
[01:51:03.536 --> 01:51:05.477]  But next they're going to implode them into Europe.
[01:51:05.537 --> 01:51:06.919]  That's the next part of the plan.
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:12.483]  Now I don't know if Netanyahu supports that plan, but I know the EU and the Vatican does.
[01:51:13.104 --> 01:51:14.365]  I know Trump does it, for real.
[01:51:15.085 --> 01:51:21.431]  So if Netanyahu comes out and says he doesn't support the Islamification of Europe, I'll be pro-Netanyahu.
[01:51:22.792 --> 01:51:24.574]  I don't think Netanyahu wants to do that to Europe.
[01:51:25.354 --> 01:51:30.138]  Now some of the leftists in Israel, George Soros that came out in the WikiLeaks wants to destroy Israel.
[01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:36.751]  So, this is all about pure evil.
[01:51:37.031 --> 01:51:38.912]  And the globalists have made a deal with radical Islam.
[01:51:39.733 --> 01:51:46.256]  And they think Saudi Arabia controlling 80% of Islam, that's going to be 2.5 billion people in just 12 years.
[01:51:46.276 --> 01:51:47.557]  3 billion total.
[01:51:48.257 --> 01:51:49.538]  They think that's unstoppable.
[01:51:50.538 --> 01:51:51.899]  I'm not submitting to Islam.
[01:51:52.319 --> 01:51:53.019]  I'm going to fight!
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:53.900]  What about you?
[01:51:55.281 --> 01:51:56.621]  And I don't care if it's Israel.
[01:51:57.302 --> 01:51:58.382]  I don't care if it's the Pope.
[01:51:58.822 --> 01:51:59.743]  I don't care if it's Trump.
[01:51:59.783 --> 01:52:02.384]  Whoever it is, they sell us out to radical Islam.
[01:52:02.664 --> 01:52:03.645]  I'm going to stand against them.
[01:52:04.994 --> 01:52:08.997]  This is a do or die situation, so I'm trying to figure out all the angles here, but let me tell you this.
[01:52:09.298 --> 01:52:11.459]  This is preparation for major war right here, baby.
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:12.760]  So you get ready.
[01:52:12.941 --> 01:52:13.581]  Let's go to the footage.
[01:52:15.323 --> 01:52:19.526]  Was that Iran continued to build Fordow years, secretly build it.
[01:52:19.906 --> 01:52:21.588]  Years after Project Ahmad ended.
[01:52:22.588 --> 01:52:23.409]  Here's what it looks like.
[01:52:23.729 --> 01:52:24.370]  That's the entrance.
[01:52:25.351 --> 01:52:26.312]  It goes under a mountain.
[01:52:30.175 --> 01:52:33.718]  You also will not be surprised that Iran insisted on keeping Fordow.
[01:52:34.787 --> 01:52:38.069]  And basically, the nuclear deal enabled it to do it.
[01:52:39.610 --> 01:52:43.393]  It enabled it to do it, but this came with a hitch.
[01:52:45.154 --> 01:52:56.081]  Iran was required by the IAEA to come clean, by the nuclear deal, to come clean to the International Atomic Energy Agency about its nuclear program.
[01:52:57.382 --> 01:53:01.725]  This was an explicit condition for implementing the nuclear deal.
[01:53:02.705 --> 01:53:04.266]  Iran has to come clean.
[01:53:05.367 --> 01:53:15.755]  So in December 2015, the IAEA published its final assessment of what it called the military aspects of Iran's nuclear program.
[01:53:16.395 --> 01:53:17.176]  This is the report.
[01:53:19.097 --> 01:53:23.020]  This was Iran's chance to fully come clean to the IAEA.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:24.141]  They could tell the truth.
[01:53:24.341 --> 01:53:26.923]  They could say we had this program, this secret program.
[01:53:27.243 --> 01:53:27.663]  It's over.
[01:53:27.683 --> 01:53:28.384]  We shelved it.
[01:53:28.924 --> 01:53:29.685]  It doesn't exist.
[01:53:30.025 --> 01:53:30.926]  We destroyed the material.
[01:53:33.502 --> 01:53:35.604]  Here's what Iran actually told the IAEA.
[01:53:36.966 --> 01:53:52.903]  It said, Iran denied the existence of a coordinated program aimed at the development of a nuclear explosive device, and specifically denied, get this, specifically denied the existence of the AMAD plan.
[01:53:56.010 --> 01:53:57.311]  The material proves otherwise.
[01:53:58.072 --> 01:54:01.594]  That Iran authorized, initiated, and funded Project Ahmad.
[01:54:02.235 --> 01:54:06.117]  A coordinated program aimed at the development of a nuclear explosive device.
[01:54:06.998 --> 01:54:10.220]  Here's another document from the archive.
[01:54:10.321 --> 01:54:13.543]  This is a master plan of Project Ahmad.
[01:54:15.084 --> 01:54:21.649]  Iran said to the IAEA, no work has been conducted with multi-point initi...
[01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:24.044]  This is multi-point initiation.
[01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:25.025]  You've got to forgive me.
[01:54:25.065 --> 01:54:31.954]  This jargon, this scientific terminology is something that is necessary to understand the production of nuclear weapons.
[01:54:31.994 --> 01:54:32.836]  But here's what they say.
[01:54:33.436 --> 01:54:38.383]  No work has been conducted with MPI technology in hemispherical geometry.
[01:54:39.281 --> 01:54:42.543]  But again, the archives shows that this is a complete fabrication.
[01:54:42.563 --> 01:54:43.704]  Yeah, that means no bomb making.
[01:54:43.724 --> 01:54:48.767]  Iran conducted extensive work with MPI technology in hemispherical geometry.
[01:54:48.807 --> 01:54:49.468]  Here's an example.
[01:54:49.508 --> 01:54:54.611]  That's the jacketed explosives that crush it down to cause a chain reaction.
[01:54:54.631 --> 01:55:01.216]  Iran said to the agency that it had not conducted metallurgical work specifically designed for a nuclear device.
[01:55:03.356 --> 01:55:06.077]  But the files again show that this is a lie.
[01:55:06.577 --> 01:55:11.498]  Iran conducted extensive metallurgical work, specifically designed for a nuclear device.
[01:55:12.098 --> 01:55:16.519]  Here's an original Iranian photo, plenty more in the archive.
[01:55:17.939 --> 01:55:24.081]  So what I've shown you tonight is just a fraction of the total material that we have.
[01:55:25.381 --> 01:55:31.083]  But even from this sample, you can draw four main conclusions.
[01:55:32.503 --> 01:55:32.783]  First,
[01:55:34.088 --> 01:55:39.410]  Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons program.
[01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:41.672]  100,000 secret files prove that they lied.
[01:55:42.812 --> 01:55:50.496]  Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons know-how for future use.
[01:55:52.176 --> 01:56:02.061]  Why would a terrorist regime hide and meticulously catalogue its secret nuclear files if not to use them at a later date?
[01:56:03.303 --> 01:56:12.093]  Third, Iran lied again in 2015 when it didn't come clean to the IAEA as required by the nuclear deal.
[01:56:13.314 --> 01:56:19.321]  And finally, the Iran deal, the nuclear deal,
[01:56:20.456 --> 01:56:21.696]  It's based on lies.
[01:56:22.557 --> 01:56:25.957]  It's based on Iranian lies and Iranian deception.
[01:56:26.017 --> 01:56:26.298]  All right.
[01:56:26.758 --> 01:56:28.358]  We're going to come back in five more minutes.
[01:56:28.418 --> 01:56:29.498]  We have a special guest joining us.
[01:56:29.518 --> 01:56:30.619]  We'll also put the phones up.
[01:56:31.099 --> 01:56:36.880]  But the head of our European Bureau is going to be joining us with some big, huge breaking news on globalism there.
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:43.522]  But this is all part of a larger global plan to take control of the Middle East and use it as a weapon system to bring down
[01:56:45.126 --> 01:56:52.831]  Asia, Russia, Europe, it's been decided demographically just like China has been decided to be in control of the system.
[01:56:53.612 --> 01:56:54.252]  It's been decided.
[01:56:54.552 --> 01:56:56.594]  Trump's also giving a press conference right now.
[01:56:57.114 --> 01:56:58.775]  We'll come back with all of that here in just a minute.
[01:56:58.835 --> 01:57:00.856]  Briefly, we're under globalist attacks.
[01:57:00.876 --> 01:57:03.998]  We're telling the truth and just telling it like it is so you can make decisions about your own life.

[01:57:09.022 --> 01:57:10.843]  The globalists hate the fact that you're buying our products.
[01:57:12.369 --> 01:57:18.091]  We have back in stock our amazing Ultimate Turmeric Formula Body Ease with a 95% curcumin level.

[01:57:28.954 --> 01:57:32.875]  It won't be 25% off when we get it back in because it's running out.
[01:57:33.715 --> 01:57:34.716]  We're hoping to get another source.

[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:38.850]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.

[02:00:14.572 --> 02:00:17.373]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:40.475 --> 02:00:41.776]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:41.936 --> 02:00:44.578]  Trump is speaking at a press conference with the Nigerian president.
[02:00:45.519 --> 02:00:49.702]  He hasn't gotten into the caravan yet, but he's set to speak on that.
[02:00:50.082 --> 02:00:53.505]  We'll go to that in the next segment, and we have a guest joining us that deals with the very same deal.
[02:00:53.905 --> 02:00:57.768]  The Globalists plan to use open borders as a weapon to bring in their master plan.
[02:00:57.788 --> 02:01:06.494]  We'll detail it all with Dan Lyman, and the amazing work he does as the head of the new InfoWars EuroDesk, and InfoWars Europe now launch the new sites.
[02:01:06.554 --> 02:01:08.175]  Be sure and check that out.
[02:01:09.056 --> 02:01:17.400]  I wanted to have a conclusion here of Netanyahu, who spoke earlier at a press conference that aired at about 8 o'clock Tel Aviv time.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.520]  And what he's saying is true about Iran.
[02:01:22.181 --> 02:01:23.282]  I don't want to have war with Iran.
[02:01:25.091 --> 02:01:33.116]  The point is the West is going towards war with Iran and Iran isn't making that any better with their belligerent pro-war statements and talking about their missiles and all the rest of it.
[02:01:33.136 --> 02:01:38.399]  So, the conclusion is the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel are all lined up to strike Iran.
[02:01:38.579 --> 02:01:39.640]  I don't want that to happen.
[02:01:40.901 --> 02:01:45.003]  Notice Netanyahu talked about how one of their new missiles can hit Moscow.
[02:01:45.163 --> 02:01:47.605]  He's trying to get the Russians on board with this.
[02:01:49.946 --> 02:01:51.347]  Why did they invent nuclear weapons?
[02:01:51.467 --> 02:01:52.748]  Well, the Pope says ban them all.
[02:01:53.834 --> 02:01:56.275]  Ban all weapons, of course, except the weapons the UN will have.
[02:01:56.516 --> 02:01:57.236]  We know what that means.
[02:01:57.796 --> 02:02:00.058]  So, I just pray humanity can survive.
[02:02:00.098 --> 02:02:03.419]  Here's the conclusion of what the Prime Minister of Israel just concluded saying.
[02:02:08.462 --> 02:02:11.444]  No work has been conducted with multi-point initiative.
[02:02:12.498 --> 02:02:13.719]  This is multi-point initiation.
[02:02:13.899 --> 02:02:14.679]  You've got to forgive me.
[02:02:14.739 --> 02:02:21.624]  This jargon, this scientific terminology is something that is necessary to understand the production of nuclear weapons.
[02:02:21.664 --> 02:02:22.504]  But here's what they say.
[02:02:23.105 --> 02:02:28.088]  No work has been conducted with MPI technology in hemispherical geometry.
[02:02:28.968 --> 02:02:32.550]  But again, the archives shows that this is a complete fabrication.
[02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:38.454]  Iran conducted extensive work with MPI technology in hemispherical geometry.
[02:02:38.514 --> 02:02:39.215]  Here's an example.
[02:02:39.915 --> 02:02:41.336]  Hundreds of more documents prove it.
[02:02:42.546 --> 02:02:50.930]  Iran said to the agency that it had not conducted metallurgical work specifically designed for a nuclear device.
[02:02:53.031 --> 02:02:55.752]  But the files again show that this is a lie.
[02:02:56.272 --> 02:03:01.174]  Iran conducted extensive metallurgical work specifically designed for a nuclear device.
[02:03:01.775 --> 02:03:03.275]  Here's an original Iranian photo.
[02:03:04.176 --> 02:03:06.197]  Plenty more in the archive.
[02:03:07.617 --> 02:03:08.638]  So what I've shown you tonight
[02:03:10.544 --> 02:03:13.748]  It's just a fraction of the total material that we have.
[02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:20.776]  But even from this sample, you can draw four main conclusions.
[02:03:22.178 --> 02:03:26.944]  First, Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons program.
[02:03:28.504 --> 02:03:31.346]  100,000 secret files prove that they lied.
[02:03:32.507 --> 02:03:40.172]  Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons know-how for future use.
[02:03:41.874 --> 02:03:51.761]  Why would a terrorist regime hide and meticulously catalog its secret nuclear files if not to use them at a later date?
[02:03:52.981 --> 02:03:53.242]  Third,
[02:03:54.506 --> 02:04:01.769]  Iran lied again in 2015 when it didn't come clean to the IAEA as required by the nuclear deal.
[02:04:02.969 --> 02:04:11.392]  And finally, the Iran deal, the nuclear deal, is based on lies.
[02:04:12.252 --> 02:04:15.754]  It's based on Iranian lies and Iranian deception.
[02:04:20.175 --> 02:04:21.736]  A hundred thousand files right here.
[02:04:23.766 --> 02:04:24.386]  That they lied.
[02:04:26.067 --> 02:04:27.047]  So here's the bottom line.
[02:04:29.188 --> 02:04:30.528]  Iran continues to lie.
[02:04:32.049 --> 02:04:35.930]  Just last week, Zarif said this.
[02:04:37.431 --> 02:04:38.952]  We never wanted to produce a bomb.
[02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:39.992]  Again?
[02:04:40.952 --> 02:04:42.473]  We never wanted to produce a bomb.
[02:04:43.113 --> 02:04:43.613]  Yes, you did.
[02:04:44.374 --> 02:04:44.934]  Yes, you do.
[02:04:45.594 --> 02:04:46.975]  And the Atomic Archive proves it.
[02:04:48.415 --> 02:04:53.437]  The nuclear deal gives Iran a clear path to an atomic arsenal.
[02:04:53.922 --> 02:04:58.205]  We'll be right back with the conclusion, then we'll shift gears to the larger global program.
[02:04:58.565 --> 02:05:00.587]  But this is the preparation for major war.
[02:05:03.726 --> 02:05:04.326]  Alpha Power.
[02:05:04.686 --> 02:05:05.507]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:05:05.727 --> 02:05:11.689]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:05:12.349 --> 02:05:15.910]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:05:16.771 --> 02:05:24.733]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:05:25.274 --> 02:05:28.655]  The average male or female enhancement
[02:05:29.615 --> 02:05:32.859]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:05:32.879 --> 02:05:34.601]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:05:34.942 --> 02:05:40.027]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and I say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:05:40.328 --> 02:05:47.957]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product.
[02:05:48.297 --> 02:05:49.299]  We're good to go.
[02:06:15.327 --> 02:06:19.629]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:19.789 --> 02:06:21.250]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.431 --> 02:06:29.233]  All right, Dan Lyman, who's setting up our European Bureau and doing a great job.
[02:06:29.273 --> 02:06:31.254]  Already covered Deimos for us and many other big events.
[02:06:31.274 --> 02:06:32.175]  He's getting a team together.
[02:06:32.715 --> 02:06:34.896]  He is just churning out amazing articles.
[02:06:35.736 --> 02:06:42.679]  We're going to get a simpler URL for it, but right now it's Europe.InfoWars.com, and that is the new slick
[02:06:44.882 --> 02:06:46.363]  European design InfoWars.
[02:06:46.843 --> 02:06:48.584]  We're gonna launch a London InfoWars.
[02:06:48.604 --> 02:06:50.225]  We're gonna launch a New York, an LA.
[02:06:50.786 --> 02:06:51.626]  We're gonna launch it all.
[02:06:52.367 --> 02:06:54.608]  We're spending all our capital that's come in to do that.
[02:06:55.168 --> 02:06:56.709]  We're expanding in the face of the globalists.
[02:06:56.749 --> 02:06:57.790]  They're really upset about it.
[02:06:58.290 --> 02:07:00.612]  But thank you all for your support.
[02:07:01.672 --> 02:07:05.675]  Before we go to Dan Lyman in the next segment, I want to just finish up with Benjamin Netanyahu from earlier.
[02:07:07.776 --> 02:07:09.077]  Do I agree with attacking Iran?
[02:07:09.397 --> 02:07:10.057]  I don't want to.
[02:07:10.978 --> 02:07:13.459]  Is Netanyahu telling the truth about Iran's nuclear weapons program?
[02:07:13.479 --> 02:07:14.220]  Yes, it's well known.
[02:07:15.196 --> 02:07:16.816]  This is not like WMDs in Iraq.
[02:07:18.657 --> 02:07:19.977]  And we know the power players.
[02:07:19.997 --> 02:07:28.860]  So I'm going to finish up with Netanyahu, then give you my detailed analysis of this and what I think we ought to do straight ahead.
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.760]  But let's finish up with the Prime Minister of Israel.
[02:07:33.141 --> 02:07:33.681]  Produce a bomb?
[02:07:34.501 --> 02:07:34.761]  Again?
[02:07:35.682 --> 02:07:37.202]  We never wanted to produce a bomb?
[02:07:37.862 --> 02:07:38.342]  Yes you did.
[02:07:39.123 --> 02:07:39.663]  Yes you do.
[02:07:40.343 --> 02:07:41.723]  And the Atomic Archive proves it.
[02:07:43.164 --> 02:07:43.904]  The nuclear deal
[02:07:44.918 --> 02:07:46.648]  Gives Iran a clear path.
[02:07:47.455 --> 02:07:48.476]  To an atomic arsenal.
[02:07:49.356 --> 02:07:53.659]  It does so because it gives them the three components that are necessary to produce this arsenal.
[02:07:54.119 --> 02:07:56.460]  First, unlimited enrichment in a few years.
[02:07:57.341 --> 02:07:58.161]  And they plan to do that.
[02:07:58.241 --> 02:08:05.726]  They plan to have several hundred thousand advanced centrifuges with which they can enrich mountains of uranium for that core that I showed you before.
[02:08:06.246 --> 02:08:07.507]  For many, many such cores.
[02:08:08.207 --> 02:08:14.050]  Second, it completely fails to address Iran's development of, continuing development of ballistic missiles.
[02:08:14.871 --> 02:08:15.311]  And third,
[02:08:17.232 --> 02:08:17.813]  And this is new.
[02:08:18.253 --> 02:08:24.678]  It completely fails to address Iran's secret nuclear bomb program and its advanced work on weaponization.
[02:08:26.299 --> 02:08:26.859]  We just did.
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:30.201]  So this is a terrible deal.
[02:08:32.023 --> 02:08:33.284]  It should never have been concluded.
[02:08:34.925 --> 02:08:43.971]  And in a few days time, President Trump will decide, will make his decision on what to do with the nuclear deal.
[02:08:45.212 --> 02:08:46.433]  I'm sure he'll do the right thing.
[02:08:47.907 --> 02:08:55.869]  The right thing for the United States, the right thing for Israel, and the right thing for the peace of the world.
[02:09:16.255 --> 02:09:19.616]  Okay, so now he's going into, I guess, Hebrew.
[02:09:20.837 --> 02:09:22.998]  I guess he'll also probably address them in Farsi next.
[02:09:23.878 --> 02:09:25.259]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:25.419 --> 02:09:31.201]  All hell about to break loose unless Iran backs down.
[02:09:31.281 --> 02:09:32.522]  That's what's going to happen.
[02:09:34.002 --> 02:09:45.767]  The decision has been made by Trump to not continue the strategy of tension with North Korea or Iran, and that if they don't come to the table, they're going to be destroyed.
[02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:52.651]  And if I have to guess, from what I've seen behind the scenes, Russia is going to stand down and stay out of it.
[02:09:53.291 --> 02:09:54.611]  China is going to stay out of it.
[02:09:55.051 --> 02:09:57.152]  And that's why you see North Korea rolling over.
[02:09:57.732 --> 02:10:00.612]  Some are spinning this like, oh, he's just getting another deal like he got with Clinton.
[02:10:00.632 --> 02:10:03.433]  No, Clinton gave them fissile material and reactors.
[02:10:06.934 --> 02:10:09.674]  They wanted to use North Korea as a destabilizing force in the area.
[02:10:09.934 --> 02:10:10.674]  Trump's pragmatic.
[02:10:10.714 --> 02:10:13.895]  He wants to merge it down the road with South Korea and build it up.
[02:10:15.353 --> 02:10:17.353]  Does that mean I agree with Trump's strategy?
[02:10:19.174 --> 02:10:21.134]  I wish there weren't nuclear weapons proliferating.
[02:10:21.834 --> 02:10:23.735]  I wish that all of this wasn't going on.
[02:10:24.795 --> 02:10:32.617]  At the same time, document cam shot please, you can't sit there with the Pope saying the whole world should just give up its weapons because that's not what's going to happen.
[02:10:34.457 --> 02:10:42.139]  But then when Trump and others try to stop the nuclearization of the peninsula or the Middle East, well they're bad guys.
[02:10:43.219 --> 02:10:43.659]  Here's the deal.
[02:10:45.029 --> 02:10:48.692]  This is part of a long seven-country strategy to bring down the Middle East.
[02:10:50.373 --> 02:10:52.295]  Trump's being told it's part of some new strategy.
[02:10:54.536 --> 02:10:56.178]  Any way you slice it, it's gonna blow up.
[02:10:57.819 --> 02:11:00.621]  And so, is Iran a threat?
[02:11:00.681 --> 02:11:00.981]  Yes.
[02:11:01.081 --> 02:11:01.782]  Do they have weapons?
[02:11:01.802 --> 02:11:02.042]  Yes.
[02:11:02.723 --> 02:11:10.989]  But did they see Qaddafi for eight years come in out of the cold, invest his money with the West, try to be our friends, and then get set up?
[02:11:12.981 --> 02:11:16.262]  And the answer is, that is exactly what he saw.
[02:11:18.203 --> 02:11:20.684]  So, Iran has seen that.
[02:11:21.304 --> 02:11:22.465]  North Korea has seen that.
[02:11:23.385 --> 02:11:27.807]  And that's why North Korea came out over the weekend and said, okay, we'll give up our nukes absolutely up front.
[02:11:28.327 --> 02:11:32.149]  You have to sign a deal not to attack us or not to invade us as soon as we give them up.
[02:11:37.611 --> 02:11:41.856]  By the way, it's not that big a deal when you've got the number of ICBMs and a few nukes like North Korea has.
[02:11:41.876 --> 02:11:43.298]  Those will be taken out very quickly.
[02:11:45.552 --> 02:11:47.073]  Since the late 70s, the U.S.
[02:11:47.094 --> 02:11:57.163]  has in-orbit platforms with DU Shabo rounds that are, let's say, weigh a couple hundred pounds, down to even smaller sizes for killing satellites or killing individuals.
[02:11:57.703 --> 02:12:02.948]  They can fire something the size of a .38 round at you that's DU and there'll be nothing but a crater where your car is.
[02:12:03.208 --> 02:12:07.172]  It's not an atomic weapon, it's not a hydrogen weapon, it's not a nuclear weapon, it's a kinetic weapon.
[02:12:07.192 --> 02:12:08.053]  It's a meteor gun.
[02:12:09.736 --> 02:12:17.357]  Now, that was accidentally declassified in the mid-90s on C-SPAN in a debate between the former head of the Star Wars program and a later head.
[02:12:17.377 --> 02:12:22.438]  And they accidentally declassified that as the only reason we even know that.
[02:12:24.619 --> 02:12:25.919]  But that's what we had in the 70s.
[02:12:25.979 --> 02:12:33.320]  So, Iran and North Korea, this is really all about a message to China and Russia.
[02:12:34.901 --> 02:12:36.341]  But I don't want an American empire.
[02:12:37.441 --> 02:12:47.046]  And I don't want to take out Iran and take out Hezbollah and then complete the globalist Saudi Arabian plan to fully implode the border with Europe and Russia and then flood us for the Islamic takeover.
[02:12:47.666 --> 02:12:52.669]  So as much as I don't like Iran and what they're doing, this is all part of a larger strategy.
[02:12:52.709 --> 02:12:56.090]  Trump just sees it as belligerent Iran, can't have nukes, can't threaten Israel.
[02:12:56.130 --> 02:12:56.571]  Guaranteed.
[02:12:57.711 --> 02:13:03.454]  But see, larger plan, they want Europe and the US open to Islam, which Trump does oppose and is actually blocking.
[02:13:04.995 --> 02:13:06.896]  So it's a very sophisticated strategy.
[02:13:09.073 --> 02:13:18.700]  That Trump's involved in, but also pragmatic at one level, but it doesn't take into account larger globalist plans that this could play into.
[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:20.021]  So it's very sophisticated.
[02:13:20.441 --> 02:13:26.205]  We'll get Dan Lyman, a great brain himself, his take on this on the other side.
[02:13:28.106 --> 02:13:34.771]  Then we'll get into South Korea's president calls for Trump to get the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with North Korea and helping bring that war basically to an end already.
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:44.025]  We've also got an amazing report from Mr. Lyman that's up on InfoWars.com and now at EuropeWars.com.
[02:13:44.085 --> 02:13:46.886]  That's Europe.InfoWars.com, the Europe Bureau.
[02:13:47.367 --> 02:13:54.731]  For now, the URL to take you right there is EuropeWars.com and it is a really slick
[02:13:56.283 --> 02:13:58.284]  Quick loading, high tech site.
[02:13:58.304 --> 02:14:01.426]  We're going to be launching a lot of these in the future, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:01.687 --> 02:14:07.210]  Looks great on mobile, and it really kind of focuses on Euro and globalism and the Islamic invasion there.
[02:14:07.591 --> 02:14:12.474]  We're going to have a bunch of other divisions and three or four person teams over each division.
[02:14:14.155 --> 02:14:19.859]  There's so much news we can't get it all up on InfoWars.com or even PrisonPlanet.com or NewsWars.com.
[02:14:21.243 --> 02:14:23.306]  Hungary won't tolerate lies and slander.
[02:14:23.326 --> 02:14:25.028]  Foreign minister blasts EU committee.
[02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:27.511]  Migrants cheat and lie to exploit system.
[02:14:27.531 --> 02:14:28.592]  Danish immigration minister.
[02:14:28.612 --> 02:14:32.798]  Well they have a new immigration minister in the UK and he's an islamicist.
[02:14:34.113 --> 02:14:37.094]  Fifty million Africans could invade Europe under ISIS plan.
[02:14:37.174 --> 02:14:37.715]  UN official.
[02:14:37.775 --> 02:14:40.056]  Islamicization of France denounced in open letter.
[02:14:40.156 --> 02:14:40.736]  Defend Europe.
[02:14:40.816 --> 02:14:43.557]  Activists expose migrant surge across European Alps.
[02:14:43.957 --> 02:14:48.740]  And right in the middle of it, in Switzerland, is Dan Lyman, the head of our new bureau.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.040]  He's getting people hired right now.
[02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:53.122]  Speaking of that, we've got every bit of our engines on.
[02:14:53.402 --> 02:14:56.443]  We're expending full fuel for the jump to the next level.
[02:14:56.743 --> 02:15:01.205]  It's like we're making a jump, you know, to hyperspace out of the solar system, next level.
[02:15:01.645 --> 02:15:02.466]  We need more fuel.
[02:15:03.396 --> 02:15:03.997]  I make it easy.
[02:15:05.858 --> 02:15:17.227]  We sell incredibly high-quality, top-of-the-line supplements at discounted prices, Patriot apparel, the best products on many other categories like air filtration, water filtration, high-quality storable foods.

[02:15:51.841 --> 02:15:54.803]  That's got to end the next few days at Infowarstore.com.
[02:16:02.921 --> 02:16:09.568]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[02:16:10.249 --> 02:16:12.031]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:18.498]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[02:16:18.898 --> 02:16:21.541]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:16:21.801 --> 02:16:24.843]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:16:25.204 --> 02:16:31.108]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:16:31.768 --> 02:16:38.233]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:16:38.593 --> 02:16:44.496]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:16:44.956 --> 02:16:48.578]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:16:49.058 --> 02:16:57.262]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[02:16:57.663 --> 02:17:03.906]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:17:04.967 --> 02:17:09.390]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[02:17:10.011 --> 02:17:18.117]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[02:17:18.677 --> 02:17:20.338]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[02:17:20.879 --> 02:17:27.804]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[02:17:27.864 --> 02:17:30.866]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[02:17:31.466 --> 02:17:32.347]  It's not absorbable.
[02:17:32.747 --> 02:17:33.308]  It's toxic.
[02:17:33.988 --> 02:17:46.100]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:48.742]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[02:17:49.483 --> 02:17:56.950]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[02:17:56.970 --> 02:17:57.871]  They used to make drugs.
[02:17:58.051 --> 02:17:59.352]  That's why the FDA is involved.
[02:18:00.013 --> 02:18:02.034]  And that's why the DEA is involved.
[02:18:02.435 --> 02:18:07.159]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:11.303]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:15.467]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[02:18:16.027 --> 02:18:18.788]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[02:18:18.808 --> 02:18:19.948]  We have a good supply right now.
[02:18:20.348 --> 02:18:21.728]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[02:18:22.148 --> 02:18:24.449]  But this may be the clincher.
[02:18:24.489 --> 02:18:27.709]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:31.530]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:34.111]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[02:18:34.451 --> 02:18:35.831]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[02:18:36.171 --> 02:18:43.553]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[02:18:43.853 --> 02:18:44.713]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:18:45.333 --> 02:18:45.493]  Yeah.
[02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.570]  I hope so.
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:18.081]  That we can work this out.
[02:19:36.215 --> 02:19:38.997]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[02:19:39.337 --> 02:19:47.661]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[02:19:48.221 --> 02:19:52.543]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[02:19:52.964 --> 02:19:59.547]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:05.828 --> 02:20:08.436]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:31.238 --> 02:20:37.325]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:20:37.725 --> 02:20:39.267]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:41.410 --> 02:20:46.796]  It has been said that there are times in history when more happens in just a few years than happened in a previous decade or more.
[02:20:48.188 --> 02:20:57.756]  And now you see Trump on the cusp of legendary peace deal, ending the 60-plus year ongoing war, which has been an armistice or ceasefire, on the Korean Peninsula.
[02:20:57.816 --> 02:21:03.901]  The Korean elected president, not the dictator of the North, calling for Trump to get a peace prize.
[02:21:03.922 --> 02:21:09.526]  You've got the Pope calling for all weapons to be destroyed, but he doesn't mean the UN or his own personal guards.
[02:21:09.967 --> 02:21:11.228]  No, he wants us to lower his guard.
[02:21:11.268 --> 02:21:14.631]  He's a globalist, just like he has walls, but you can't have walls.
[02:21:16.004 --> 02:21:25.494]  We've got all that to break down, but I wanted to get Dan Lyman on because we've launched EuropeWars.com, or just Europe.infoWars.com, our European office.
[02:21:25.514 --> 02:21:26.955]  He's already got a few crew members over there.
[02:21:27.356 --> 02:21:32.241]  He's already filed hundreds of great reports, gone out and covered Davos, you name it, and done a sterling job.
[02:21:32.921 --> 02:21:37.086]  Well, there's so much going on because Europe is where the globalists are destroying the borders.
[02:21:38.424 --> 02:21:42.187]  That's where they flooded in more than 10,000 Muslims just the last five years.
[02:21:42.407 --> 02:21:45.149]  It is the admitted UN program to get rid of the borders.
[02:21:45.890 --> 02:21:49.272]  And so whereas I want to stand up to Iran, I want to stand up to Hezbollah.
[02:21:51.174 --> 02:21:57.199]  You've got Saudi Arabia, though, who's even worse, and they're wanting us to take out Assad, who didn't do anything.
[02:21:58.413 --> 02:22:03.017]  And they're pressuring for an attack on Iran, who we do know has been developing nuclear weapons.
[02:22:03.477 --> 02:22:05.659]  And that was a fraudulent deal they signed.
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:08.642]  Netanyahu was right about that.
[02:22:09.883 --> 02:22:21.113]  But at the same time, if we take down all those buffer countries, those Muslim countries that aren't under Saudi Arabian control, that are Shiite, or who are Alawite, or who are Ba'athist,
[02:22:22.606 --> 02:22:28.291]  Then we have the hegemonic control of Saudi Arabia who is financing the Islamification of Europe.
[02:22:28.791 --> 02:22:43.103]  And how that ties into everything Dan Lyman has been breaking down and the incredible news that all over Europe they're appointing as mayors and police chiefs and heads of security and heads of border control Islamists who aren't even from those countries.
[02:22:43.563 --> 02:22:46.085]  UK's new immigration chief has Pakistan Muslim.
[02:22:46.605 --> 02:22:48.867]  So Dan Lyman joins us from Europe.
[02:22:49.708 --> 02:22:50.629]  Thank you for joining us, Dan.
[02:22:51.837 --> 02:22:52.797]  Pleasure to be back with you, Alex.
[02:22:52.837 --> 02:22:53.277]  How are you doing?
[02:22:53.838 --> 02:22:54.078]  Good.
[02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:55.498]  You've heard my whole layout here.
[02:22:56.198 --> 02:22:57.278]  This all ties together.
[02:22:57.358 --> 02:22:59.839]  I mean, as you know, what is your geopolitical view on this?
[02:23:00.959 --> 02:23:01.420]  Absolutely.
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:02.300]  Never a dull moment.
[02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.300]  There's always something going on on every front.
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:07.881]  And it seems like, as you said, the quickening is definitely happening.
[02:23:07.901 --> 02:23:12.062]  There's more news every day, everywhere around the world and Europe.
[02:23:12.122 --> 02:23:13.443]  There's always something going on here.
[02:23:13.883 --> 02:23:16.844]  So it's just, it's amazing trying to keep, you know, your head around the whole thing.
[02:23:16.884 --> 02:23:17.704]  It just keeps you spinning.
[02:23:20.054 --> 02:23:27.377]  Front and center, though, looking at that paradigm of what the globalists want versus what nation-states want.
[02:23:27.877 --> 02:23:32.759]  Eastern Europe standing up as champions against the Islamic invasion, because they've been invaded over a hundred times.
[02:23:33.139 --> 02:23:34.420]  You've been going to Eastern Europe.
[02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:35.420]  You've been covering this.
[02:23:37.001 --> 02:23:39.882]  Talk about their awakening and where you see that leading to.
[02:23:41.303 --> 02:23:41.723]  Absolutely.
[02:23:41.763 --> 02:23:51.450]  I've spent a lot of time around the bulk of Europe at this point in the last few years, and there's definitely a divide between Eastern and Western Europe, as I've mentioned in the past on the show here.
[02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:59.915]  When you go to Western European countries and their cities that were once magnificent places, such as London and Paris, these places are decaying.
[02:23:59.956 --> 02:24:00.456]  They're rotting.
[02:24:00.476 --> 02:24:05.599]  There are still nice little enclaves within them, but I've stayed in No Go Zone in Paris.
[02:24:05.899 --> 02:24:07.120]  I was in London last year.
[02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:11.123]  I was actually in quite a nice area of London last year in a very nice hotel.
[02:24:11.203 --> 02:24:11.463]  We're good.
[02:24:22.905 --> 02:24:24.666]  And they're bringing in Sharia law.
[02:24:24.686 --> 02:24:31.288]  I was reading in England, in Sweden, in Germany, they're introducing legislation to have men and women be divided.
[02:24:31.648 --> 02:24:33.809]  The Green Party's saying, yeah, maybe that's the answer.
[02:24:34.390 --> 02:24:39.011]  This is a strategic deal with the left and Islam because Europe doesn't have any kids.
[02:24:39.091 --> 02:24:42.193]  Islam has six kids versus 1.3 for a couple in the West.
[02:24:42.253 --> 02:24:43.173]  I mean, the deal's been made.
[02:24:44.523 --> 02:24:45.003]  Absolutely.
[02:24:45.023 --> 02:24:46.024]  You know, it's incredible.
[02:24:46.104 --> 02:24:52.789]  It never fails that even in the little city that I live in in Switzerland, there's a pretty hefty Islamic population here.
[02:24:53.249 --> 02:24:56.271]  And it never fails that the women are always with child.
[02:24:56.311 --> 02:24:59.333]  There's at least one in the baby carriage, sometimes two or three.
[02:24:59.813 --> 02:25:02.155]  And generally, you know, the man keeps his distance.
[02:25:02.195 --> 02:25:05.517]  He gets to wear whatever he wants and behave however he wants.
[02:25:05.637 --> 02:25:09.800]  And then the woman is basically expected to live, you know, under the shawl.
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:12.081]  I see some pretty crazy outfits at this point.
[02:25:12.122 --> 02:25:14.083]  They're like proud to wear this stuff.
[02:25:14.563 --> 02:25:15.224]  We're good to go.
[02:25:32.541 --> 02:25:33.041]  Thank you so much.
[02:25:55.629 --> 02:25:56.890]  Well, we've sent our crews in.
[02:25:56.930 --> 02:26:00.131]  Most areas of Europe are no-go zones for white people or Westerners.
[02:26:01.012 --> 02:26:02.172]  And this is the plan.
[02:26:02.232 --> 02:26:03.673]  It's encouraged by the leftist media.
[02:26:03.713 --> 02:26:09.516]  As you know, Germany runs TV ads for kids in their after-school program saying, are you a 14-year-old girl?
[02:26:09.616 --> 02:26:10.616]  Marry a Muslim man.
[02:26:10.656 --> 02:26:11.557]  They will treat you right.
[02:26:11.877 --> 02:26:20.900]  Wear the hijab, and then that's a part of the jihad, is to wear the hijab in our face, just to throw it in our face, to rub it in and get us ready.
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:34.205]  But what's sad is to see Europe, that withstood 1400 years of Islamic invasion, bought off and sold out to it, and to see the stonings and the attacks and the rapes, and the media defending it, is just truly sickening.
[02:26:35.507 --> 02:26:37.028]  It is, and you know what's amazing?
[02:26:37.128 --> 02:26:40.170]  I just spent a few weeks down in Australia in New Zealand.
[02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:49.835]  I wasn't sure what to expect there, and I spent some time in Melbourne, Australia, and it looked just like every other major city in Western Europe and parts of the U.S.
[02:26:49.875 --> 02:26:50.496]  even at times.
[02:26:51.616 --> 02:27:00.741]  I felt like I wasn't around Australians much of the time, and I found that to be troubling to see that that has spread just so far across the Western world.
[02:27:00.821 --> 02:27:01.582]  It's everywhere.
[02:27:02.102 --> 02:27:02.622]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:27:02.662 --> 02:27:07.644]  Latin Americans are the future because Europeans have 1.3 kids, but they're not Islamists.
[02:27:08.244 --> 02:27:11.786]  And if we can keep them from being brainwashed by the left, they'll make good citizens.
[02:27:11.806 --> 02:27:12.426]  They're good people.
[02:27:13.226 --> 02:27:15.447]  But the Islamists, they're not going to convert to the West.
[02:27:15.487 --> 02:27:17.188]  They're not going to convert to openness.
[02:27:17.208 --> 02:27:17.688]  They're cancer.
[02:27:18.467 --> 02:27:22.169]  And you go anywhere in Austin now, it's like I'm living in the middle of an Islamic city.
[02:27:22.930 --> 02:27:28.293]  And I was reading statistics in Europe, on average 84% of Muslim families are on welfare.
[02:27:28.933 --> 02:27:31.034]  They come and have six kids, they get on welfare.
[02:27:31.595 --> 02:27:34.977]  The men wear jumpsuits and adopt gangster culture.
[02:27:35.397 --> 02:27:36.257]  It's hideous!
[02:27:36.317 --> 02:27:38.839]  And it was all over Paris, you name it.
[02:27:38.879 --> 02:27:40.220]  Human feces everywhere.
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:48.624]  Burning buildings every night, cars being attacked, and with a bunch of spoiled, rotten, crazy people just doing whatever they want.
[02:27:48.664 --> 02:27:51.125]  This is an insane way to commit suicide.
[02:27:52.478 --> 02:27:53.599]  It's depressing to watch.
[02:27:53.679 --> 02:27:59.663]  There was recently a Hungarian journalist that was interviewing Viktor Orban, who I'm sure we're all familiar with at this point.
[02:28:00.023 --> 02:28:07.228]  And it's even amazing to see that some of the personalities in some of these, you know, Eastern European countries, they feel comfortable talking about the issue at hand.
[02:28:07.288 --> 02:28:10.870]  And he said flat out, Western civilization is digging its own grave.
[02:28:11.251 --> 02:28:13.312]  And we see that happening all over the place.
[02:28:13.392 --> 02:28:14.513]  And it is troubling.
[02:28:15.073 --> 02:28:15.573]  I think?
[02:28:33.882 --> 02:28:39.145]  They'll take over entire city blocks just to do prayer, and people need to wake up to this.
[02:28:39.205 --> 02:28:39.945]  It's getting a little crazy.
[02:28:39.965 --> 02:28:45.448]  Yeah, because we can't go to their countries and do this, and they're all trying to flee their wonderful countries to come here and then turn it into that.
[02:28:45.488 --> 02:28:49.710]  There's not even that thought like, I hate this, I want to leave it, but I'm going to turn it into that once I get there.
[02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:54.012]  And of course, you have interviewed the Prime Minister of Hungary.
[02:28:54.032 --> 02:28:54.992]  I want you to interview him again.
[02:28:55.012 --> 02:28:56.753]  In fact, I'm told you may be doing that very, very soon.
[02:28:56.853 --> 02:29:00.675]  We'll be back with Dan Lyman from the Islamification of Europe, straight ahead.
[02:29:02.953 --> 02:29:07.395]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[02:29:07.515 --> 02:29:15.458]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[02:29:15.878 --> 02:29:17.499]  But, here's what you want to know.
[02:29:18.490 --> 02:29:24.433]  You want to go to mfullmorestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:29:25.113 --> 02:29:28.654]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:29:29.535 --> 02:29:37.538]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:29:38.118 --> 02:29:45.782]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:29:46.582 --> 02:29:50.345]  It's got the best of ancient science, with the latest developments as well.
[02:29:50.906 --> 02:29:54.869]  It's Alpha Power, and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:29:55.960 --> 02:30:10.824]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:30:11.244 --> 02:30:16.565]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:30:16.906 --> 02:30:18.426]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[02:30:18.746 --> 02:30:19.586]  Oh man, it's really great.
[02:30:19.606 --> 02:30:20.086]  It really works.
[02:30:20.106 --> 02:30:24.708]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpapower because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[02:30:25.228 --> 02:30:29.549]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:30:29.569 --> 02:30:30.889]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:30:31.710 --> 02:30:37.931]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[02:30:38.331 --> 02:30:40.392]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:30:40.912 --> 02:30:42.552]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:30:42.572 --> 02:30:43.933]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:30:43.993 --> 02:30:45.393]  You've got marketing other costs that go in.
[02:30:48.314 --> 02:30:49.155]  But here's an example.
[02:30:49.975 --> 02:30:57.581]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:30:57.601 --> 02:30:59.282]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:30:59.782 --> 02:31:05.947]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:31:06.627 --> 02:31:11.732]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:31:12.013 --> 02:31:20.361]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:31:20.762 --> 02:31:21.783]  Nobody else does that.
[02:31:21.863 --> 02:31:24.526]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:31:25.046 --> 02:31:41.176]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:31:41.596 --> 02:31:50.539]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[02:31:50.919 --> 02:31:52.939]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:31:53.319 --> 02:31:58.921]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[02:31:58.941 --> 02:31:59.641]  A total 360 win.
[02:32:02.802 --> 02:32:06.664]  Fill your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:32:07.224 --> 02:32:14.628]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:32:15.328 --> 02:32:20.030]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:22.552]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:32:23.172 --> 02:32:26.593]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:32:27.394 --> 02:32:29.595]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods
[02:32:31.311 --> 02:32:36.835]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:32:36.875 --> 02:32:38.696]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:32:38.716 --> 02:32:39.617]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:32:57.208 --> 02:33:00.173]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:33:00.714 --> 02:33:02.516]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:06.722 --> 02:33:09.346]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.274 --> 02:33:41.157]  We're live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, and the head of our new European Bureau we're launching, Dan Lyman, doing a great job is here, EuropeWars.com, or Europe.InfoWars.com will take you there.
[02:33:41.177 --> 02:33:43.597]  Whole new look, very, very clean site.
[02:33:44.438 --> 02:33:48.518]  NewsWars.com is excellent as well, but we are in a media war.
[02:33:48.618 --> 02:33:51.259]  We are in a war for the future of Europe.
[02:33:53.581 --> 02:34:02.546]  And again, the left is not bringing in massive amounts of Islamists to get them then to convert to Western culture, or even be open to it.
[02:34:02.586 --> 02:34:04.247]  They want them to be anti-Western.
[02:34:04.307 --> 02:34:04.708]  It's taught.
[02:34:05.608 --> 02:34:08.690]  In Switzerland, everywhere, the stuff you read sounds like Monty Python.
[02:34:09.090 --> 02:34:10.051]  It sounds like a joke.
[02:34:10.851 --> 02:34:11.552]  But it's real.
[02:34:13.213 --> 02:34:16.975]  Women say they go to be raped, and they go, it's okay, they raped me, I love them.
[02:34:18.056 --> 02:34:21.838]  And they wouldn't give the time of day to a Swiss man or a German person, any of that.
[02:34:22.981 --> 02:34:27.423]  And again, every day there's new no-go zone videos of people having rocks thrown at them.
[02:34:27.963 --> 02:34:29.584]  You know, female reporters being beaten up.
[02:34:29.604 --> 02:34:32.966]  And it's the same from Belgium to Italy to Switzerland.
[02:34:33.945 --> 02:34:42.430]  In fact, Dan Lyman, you were telling me about a story that we can pull up about a Somali individual that tried to burn down a church.
[02:34:43.370 --> 02:34:46.752]  People can also follow you on Twitter at Citizen Analyst.
[02:34:46.792 --> 02:34:55.397]  Again, Dan Lyman, you were telling us about a Somali trying to burn down a church in the Canton, or the little state of Switzerland you live in.
[02:34:56.397 --> 02:34:56.837]  That's correct.
[02:34:56.897 --> 02:35:00.160]  I live in a pretty quiet state here in Switzerland.
[02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:03.062]  The most major city is the one I live in, and it's not that large.
[02:35:03.162 --> 02:35:04.683]  Nothing like Zurich or Geneva.
[02:35:05.424 --> 02:35:09.406]  And sure enough, the other day, we do have migrants in town here.
[02:35:09.767 --> 02:35:13.609]  It's not like Paris or anything like that, but there are enough of them, and it's a little unsettling.
[02:35:13.649 --> 02:35:19.474]  They tend to congregate, and they just take over little areas of town once in a while.
[02:35:19.554 --> 02:35:22.396]  And anyways, in the canton here, in a little town nearby,
[02:35:22.956 --> 02:35:23.116]  Yeah.
[02:35:41.664 --> 02:35:41.784]  Yeah.
[02:35:57.333 --> 02:35:57.433]  What
[02:36:16.681 --> 02:36:20.603]  That's a load that's passed on to the taxpayers, and you have a lot of these countries as well.
[02:36:20.623 --> 02:36:24.185]  The older folks, the pensioners, veterans, they're being treated very poorly.
[02:36:24.365 --> 02:36:25.366]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:36:25.386 --> 02:36:27.687]  I mean, you saw what Macron, everybody's thinking he's a good guy.
[02:36:27.747 --> 02:36:28.207]  No, he's not.
[02:36:28.607 --> 02:36:30.208]  He said get rid of nationalism when he was here.
[02:36:30.668 --> 02:36:33.230]  He said we should have 200 million North Africans come here.
[02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:34.610]  Yeah, it'll bankrupt us.
[02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:35.771]  Yeah, it'll cause a civil war.
[02:36:35.851 --> 02:36:36.271]  So what?
[02:36:36.611 --> 02:36:38.192]  It's the right thing to do.
[02:36:38.592 --> 02:36:39.153]  Here's the deal.
[02:36:39.753 --> 02:36:41.433]  North Africa is a hellhole everywhere.
[02:36:41.993 --> 02:36:43.614]  It just gets worse down the eastern coast.
[02:36:44.494 --> 02:36:46.354]  The Middle East is a hellhole almost everywhere.
[02:36:46.794 --> 02:36:47.514]  It's a fact.
[02:36:47.654 --> 02:36:48.535]  It is cultural.
[02:36:49.075 --> 02:36:50.555]  It is a conquest society.
[02:36:50.635 --> 02:36:51.635]  Women have no rights.
[02:36:52.075 --> 02:37:02.397]  It's one thing to take a few percent of these people in, which is still massive, but to bring in tens of millions and have giant tent cities everywhere with people diarrhea-ing all over the place.
[02:37:02.477 --> 02:37:05.878]  I mean, they say it's killed 80% of the tourism in France.
[02:37:06.958 --> 02:37:08.820]  Paul's family moved to France 15 years ago.
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:10.102]  They had to move out to Spain.
[02:37:10.122 --> 02:37:12.805]  I mean, it's just insane asylum.
[02:37:12.845 --> 02:37:17.269]  I mean, I went to Rome, and it looks just like what you're seeing down the main thoroughfare.
[02:37:17.710 --> 02:37:20.593]  This is, I mean, what are the globalists thinking?
[02:37:20.653 --> 02:37:21.614]  What are the leftists thinking?
[02:37:22.617 --> 02:37:22.917]  I don't know.
[02:37:22.957 --> 02:37:26.079]  I've seen these same scenes in multiple European cities.
[02:37:26.159 --> 02:37:28.140]  Paris looks just like that in a lot of parts.
[02:37:28.900 --> 02:37:33.002]  And now I have friends who ask me where to go to Europe, and Europe, and I say, just don't even bother.
[02:37:33.042 --> 02:37:33.723]  It's not worth it.
[02:37:34.443 --> 02:37:36.464]  Go to maybe a lesser known place.
[02:37:36.504 --> 02:37:37.225]  Try Budapest.
[02:37:37.305 --> 02:37:38.285]  Budapest is a great place.
[02:37:38.305 --> 02:37:39.686]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:37:39.806 --> 02:37:47.850]  And you know what's funny is it's like every year the number that we're expected to swallow becomes more, like little by little, they're turning up the heat.
[02:37:47.910 --> 02:37:49.131]  Oh yeah, don't forget that part.
[02:37:49.491 --> 02:37:56.886]  They're threatening, what is it, a million euro fine for every, quote, refugee that countries don't take in, hungry in Poland.
[02:37:57.106 --> 02:37:58.248]  Tell folks about that.
[02:37:59.164 --> 02:38:04.847]  Sure, yeah, they're constantly turning up the heat on the countries that won't accept these migrant quotas.
[02:38:04.947 --> 02:38:07.588]  And now you have all the leaders, they're just spilling the beans.
[02:38:07.608 --> 02:38:12.211]  They're saying it's unlimited, it's limitless, it's not 10,000, it's not 100,000, it's not even a million.
[02:38:12.271 --> 02:38:13.752]  Now they're talking 150 to 200 million.
[02:38:13.772 --> 02:38:16.033]  That's out of Macron's mouth, basically, when he's talking about
[02:38:20.555 --> 02:38:20.715]  500 million.
[02:38:20.755 --> 02:38:21.135]  ISIS plans 500 million.
[02:38:21.156 --> 02:38:23.217]  And remember, they're coordinating with the socialists in Europe.
[02:38:23.257 --> 02:38:23.678]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:39.241 --> 02:38:39.701]  Absolutely.
[02:38:39.741 --> 02:38:51.251]  And these coincide with figures that people like Geert Wilders and the Netherlands have been warning about, saying, you know, the population of Africa is set to explode to something like 4 billion by the 20, you know, the 22nd century.
[02:38:51.691 --> 02:38:56.015]  And a lot of them are being driven this way for a variety of reasons.
[02:38:56.275 --> 02:38:58.837]  You look all the way down to South Africa, what's going on there?
[02:38:58.857 --> 02:39:07.043]  If they eliminate all the farmers there and there's another, there's a famine or they're, you know, those people are going to be driven up towards- And let's be clear, let's be clear.
[02:39:07.684 --> 02:39:08.304]  White people
[02:39:09.372 --> 02:39:16.084]  ...are not tolerated in anything below tiny minority numbers in Asia, in most areas of Latin America, and in Africa.
[02:39:16.384 --> 02:39:18.608]  So if white people can't even have part of Europe...
[02:39:19.454 --> 02:39:22.456]  And it's run by anti-white leftists who just want to conquer everything.
[02:39:22.476 --> 02:39:23.496]  They see the demographic numbers.
[02:39:23.736 --> 02:39:29.360]  They want to turn these majorities that are quote minorities into belligerent racial mobs.
[02:39:29.740 --> 02:39:36.524]  So it's basically the EU is using a Hitlerian strategy for global domination just like Hitler when he cooked up the whole plan.
[02:39:36.804 --> 02:39:40.546]  People don't know that Hitler had African brigades, Arab brigades.
[02:39:41.186 --> 02:39:43.548]  He had big fans in Central and South America.
[02:39:44.328 --> 02:39:46.010]  All racial-based politics as well.
[02:39:46.090 --> 02:39:52.636]  People don't get this, that they've double-crossed the Christian ethos of Europe trying to end slavery, trying to open things up.
[02:39:53.016 --> 02:39:58.941]  They've put the guilt back onto us and gotten us to accept the identity politics, but only for us to commit suicide.
[02:39:59.241 --> 02:40:01.724]  But that's only so technocrats can destroy the first world.
[02:40:03.285 --> 02:40:09.170]  And not only that, they've even gotten a lot of the Christian organizations, they've subverted them into accepting this and fully pushing it.
[02:40:09.430 --> 02:40:11.052]  There was a church in Melbourne, Australia,
[02:40:15.011 --> 02:40:27.574]  Oh, it's all the World Council of Churches, the Methodist Church.
[02:40:27.634 --> 02:40:29.254]  It's not liberal, help poor people.
[02:40:29.614 --> 02:40:31.214]  No, no, the Catholic Church, all of it is.
[02:40:31.334 --> 02:40:32.695]  Weaponize them, bring them in.
[02:40:32.955 --> 02:40:36.255]  They're bringing down anybody being middle class.
[02:40:36.336 --> 02:40:37.636]  This is turning the world poor.
[02:40:37.976 --> 02:40:38.796]  This is feudalism.
[02:40:39.036 --> 02:40:43.437]  And they're using a demonic, fake Christian church to help Christianity commit suicide.
[02:40:45.535 --> 02:41:02.583]  Absolutely, and I had another revelation kind of when I was in Melbourne, and I'm sure other people have picked up on this, but when you consider the, you know, the Agenda 21 type planning, where they are pushing people out of the rural areas into the cities, so you're getting like a total inversion of the population that are all moving into these cities.
[02:41:02.663 --> 02:41:14.988]  But not only that, they're using a lot of these cities, like the ones that the UN really will tout, like Austin, like Melbourne, like Sydney, and they're not only driving the country folk into the cities to seek jobs,
[02:41:15.188 --> 02:41:26.051]  They're also bringing in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people from the third world as well, who are expected to take them in because they're looking for jobs or they're refugees or whatever.
[02:41:26.371 --> 02:41:30.872]  In Melbourne alone, their population is growing 100,000 to 150,000 people per year.
[02:41:31.112 --> 02:41:34.253]  And let's be clear, under the UN, Obama did this here.
[02:41:34.293 --> 02:41:37.054]  He said, the rural areas are too white.
[02:41:37.754 --> 02:41:44.824]  So they bring in third world populations and send them to your local town to then outvote you and take over so the globalists can exploit you.
[02:41:44.844 --> 02:41:46.646]  They're not helping these poor third world people.
[02:41:46.927 --> 02:41:49.130]  This is a very diabolical plan.
[02:41:49.450 --> 02:41:50.372]  It's an admitted plan.
[02:41:50.412 --> 02:41:51.553]  How do we stop it, Dan Lyman?
[02:41:51.653 --> 02:41:52.735]  Because the world is waking up.
[02:41:53.638 --> 02:41:56.099]  Well, it's going to take some serious fight.
[02:41:56.639 --> 02:42:01.160]  We have to look to the leaders that are taking a stand and it's going to take a lot more people speaking up.
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:15.644]  I think people have to be, they have to just stop worrying about what other people think about what they say because the more people speak up, the majority of people do not want this, but also the majority of that majority stay quiet because they're worried about their jobs, they're worried about what their friends will think of them.
[02:42:15.964 --> 02:42:22.006]  Sorry, but you've got to draw a line in the sand because eventually you will have no civilization to worry about and no job to worry about either.
[02:42:22.657 --> 02:42:37.703]  But if the people showing up were nice, then that would be fine, but it's like foam at the mouth, we're gonna kill you, they sell women into sex slavery, they throw gays off buildings, and they've got the Muslim women leading the women's marches, but no pro-lifers are allowed.
[02:42:39.384 --> 02:42:41.665]  More and more white women in hijabs these days, too.
[02:42:41.785 --> 02:42:42.385]  It's disturbing.
[02:42:43.470 --> 02:42:50.553]  Well, I mean, it's an absolute planned suicide, because they train women not to want a man around, so they go to the real radical level of wanting a pimp.
[02:42:50.973 --> 02:42:54.234]  And under Islam, he will treat you like you're a street hooker.
[02:42:54.454 --> 02:42:57.195]  He will pimp your ass good, and you're gonna love it.
[02:42:57.655 --> 02:42:58.376]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:58.396 --> 02:42:58.776]  Stay with us.
[02:43:02.279 --> 02:43:11.305]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:11.365 --> 02:43:19.611]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:19.791 --> 02:43:24.454]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:24.654 --> 02:43:31.357]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:31.437 --> 02:43:38.520]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:40.421]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:43:40.521 --> 02:43:45.483]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:45.644 --> 02:43:49.985]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:50.126 --> 02:43:53.327]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:53.507 --> 02:43:59.638]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:43:59.818 --> 02:44:01.461]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:05.097 --> 02:44:08.419]  This lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment right to free speech.
[02:44:08.899 --> 02:44:18.946]  It isn't just about myself, but it's about every single American who exercises their right to say what they think about what they see reported in the media and by the government.
[02:44:19.166 --> 02:44:23.409]  If Mr. Gilmour wins, Brennan Gilmour, we will lose that right.
[02:44:23.769 --> 02:44:24.670]  If Soros wins,
[02:44:25.310 --> 02:44:36.501]  The literal Nazi collaborator that has overthrown all these other countries, if he wins with all his paychecks he sends out, then this will be the repeal of the First Amendment by fiat.
[02:44:36.661 --> 02:44:43.408]  What it is is propaganda, 50, 60, 70, 80 page filings that then defame myself, the First Amendment.
[02:44:44.248 --> 02:44:45.789]  Uh, President Trump, you name it.
[02:44:46.170 --> 02:44:54.735]  Where they just say all these horrible things that aren't true, things that we never said, knowing that they are protected in defamation inside the court.
[02:44:54.835 --> 02:45:03.681]  The dying corporate media then picks it up and goes out and puts it out as gospel, and then calls for Infowars as a precedent-setting case to be deplatformed.
[02:45:03.721 --> 02:45:04.662]  So, they've told us.
[02:45:05.785 --> 02:45:12.770]  We don't like you putting out different talking points, different ideas than what the Soros Democratic Party funded media wants.
[02:45:13.050 --> 02:45:14.631]  And that's the real sin of Infowars.
[02:45:14.671 --> 02:45:18.413]  This really is an attack on the First Amendment.
[02:45:18.813 --> 02:45:21.115]  And if that falls, everything else falls.
[02:45:21.255 --> 02:45:22.356]  That's not just rhetoric.
[02:45:23.701 --> 02:45:25.662]  That they're trying to overturn the First Amendment.
[02:45:25.762 --> 02:45:26.262]  My God.
[02:45:26.643 --> 02:45:27.583]  This is like Orwellian.
[02:45:27.623 --> 02:45:28.524]  I'm force-fed.
[02:45:28.864 --> 02:45:32.546]  I'm trying to eat a steak at Trump Tower and I got damned CNN looking down on me.
[02:45:32.966 --> 02:45:34.647]  And then if I'm in the airport, there it is.
[02:45:35.047 --> 02:45:39.549]  And a lot of your restaurants, you walk in the bathroom and there's Anderson Cooper looking down at your ding-ding.
[02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:42.631]  And it's like, can I just get these people out of my life?
[02:45:43.211 --> 02:45:44.452]  I don't want to censor them.
[02:45:44.892 --> 02:45:45.833]  I don't want to shut them down.
[02:45:45.853 --> 02:45:46.873]  I don't want to put them in prison.
[02:45:47.013 --> 02:45:49.054]  I just want to be able to change the channel.
[02:45:49.214 --> 02:45:49.835]  But I can't!
[02:45:50.655 --> 02:45:52.596]  Instead, it's every night on CNN.
[02:45:52.896 --> 02:45:54.357]  Roger Stone's a Russian-Asian.
[02:45:54.437 --> 02:45:56.058]  Alex Jones is a criminal demon.
[02:45:56.879 --> 02:46:01.341]  You know, George Soros never... George Soros was a Holocaust survivor and battled the Nazis.
[02:46:01.721 --> 02:46:03.102]  Alex Jones says he helped him.
[02:46:03.302 --> 02:46:04.723]  No, he said it on 60 Minutes!
[02:46:05.303 --> 02:46:09.085]  And that's why Soros has a hit out on my free speech.
[02:46:09.465 --> 02:46:15.529]  Specifically because he doesn't want me to say that he said he had the best time of his life rounding up Jews.
[02:46:16.169 --> 02:46:17.150]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:46:17.370 --> 02:46:19.031]  The best time in his life.
[02:46:19.311 --> 02:46:20.633]  I quite enjoyed it.
[02:46:21.113 --> 02:46:22.354]  Smiling like a demon.
[02:46:22.594 --> 02:46:23.955]  Talk about psycho world!
[02:46:24.195 --> 02:46:24.816]  So I want to say this.
[02:46:24.836 --> 02:46:26.297]  I apologize to George Soros.
[02:46:27.198 --> 02:46:29.359]  He actually went in on the D-Day invasion of Normandy.
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:32.462]  He personally killed 5,000 Nazis and severed Hitler's head.
[02:46:32.742 --> 02:46:38.544]  I want to kneel to Soros and say, Your Lordship, you are a hero that killed Hitler.
[02:46:38.844 --> 02:46:39.024]  There!
[02:46:39.044 --> 02:46:40.145]  They'll probably put that out.
[02:46:40.345 --> 02:46:40.965]  Anderson Cooper.
[02:46:41.165 --> 02:46:43.206]  Jones admits tonight that it was actually George Soros.
[02:46:43.446 --> 02:46:54.570]  And here's hidden film footage of the OSS head from World War II as he fights 400 SS officers who had actually turned into werewolves and then severs the head of Adolf Hitler.
[02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:55.911]  So, that's the truth.
[02:46:56.111 --> 02:46:57.191]  Soros killed Hitler.
[02:46:57.571 --> 02:46:58.852]  So, hail Soros!
[02:47:06.212 --> 02:47:08.815]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:27.925 --> 02:47:30.008]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:30.489 --> 02:47:35.655]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:47:36.957 --> 02:47:38.980]  Alright!
[02:47:40.222 --> 02:47:50.012]  We're going to have Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, always powerful, always informative, hosting the fourth hour of the War Room with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone are always locked and loaded, coming up with three more hours.
[02:47:50.052 --> 02:47:54.376]  We've launched 10 hours live a day with David Knight, three hours in the morning, doing a great job.
[02:47:55.036 --> 02:48:02.343]  We've got Millie and Gavin on the ground reporting on the UN-funded caravan coming in.
[02:48:02.804 --> 02:48:03.605]  We're covering it all.
[02:48:05.663 --> 02:48:09.467]  The globalists, the big megacorporations have decided they like authoritarianism.
[02:48:10.048 --> 02:48:11.790]  They've decided they like radical Islam.
[02:48:13.051 --> 02:48:17.896]  They've an ally with Saudi Arabia to basically, you know, buy most of our oil from them since the 70s.
[02:48:18.777 --> 02:48:20.199]  And things are just getting crazier.
[02:48:20.219 --> 02:48:21.120]  They're just getting worse.
[02:48:22.701 --> 02:48:23.943]  Now, a lot of good things are happening.
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:29.681]  On the local scene, in different parts of the world, but in the big picture, the globalists are out of control.
[02:48:30.181 --> 02:48:42.044]  You've got nationalism, populism being awakened everywhere, but you've got the culture and all the mall shops, whether in Europe or the U.S., you walk by Gap and it's women in a jibs.
[02:48:43.064 --> 02:48:44.545]  It's all being force-fed.
[02:48:44.605 --> 02:48:50.246]  Instead of wanting to free these women, Mall of America now has become Little Mogadishu.
[02:48:53.514 --> 02:49:00.055]  And you've got Linda Saucer criticizing Iranian women a few months ago who protested and refused to wear hijabs.
[02:49:01.203 --> 02:49:02.224]  Well, that's not feminist.
[02:49:02.264 --> 02:49:04.886]  The feminists are like, stop being a grandstander, lady.
[02:49:05.326 --> 02:49:06.607]  It's total inversion.
[02:49:07.588 --> 02:49:12.452]  And women going along with modern feminism are being completely pimped by this thing.
[02:49:12.472 --> 02:49:18.657]  Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com or Europe.InfoWars.com, our Europe division.
[02:49:18.977 --> 02:49:23.541]  Any tips you've got, you can send them to him, obviously, at his Twitter as well that we just had up on screen.
[02:49:23.561 --> 02:49:25.763]  A lot of powerful articles, a lot of exclusives.
[02:49:26.443 --> 02:49:29.425]  He's got a few writers he's getting set up to also help with the site.
[02:49:29.445 --> 02:49:38.250]  Some of our articles that Paul and Steve write will also be posted there, but he is a one-man show right now, hiring some more people, doing just a fabulous job.
[02:49:40.271 --> 02:49:53.179]  Looking at this, pulling back from this, this new Islamic head of immigration for England, it's so epic, it's so big, it's so insane,
[02:49:54.232 --> 02:49:58.035]  Where do you and your gut see this going and what are other big stories you think people should know about?
[02:49:59.716 --> 02:50:08.081]  That question is always a doozy because nobody wants to think it's going to go the way that many places I think are going to go.
[02:50:08.381 --> 02:50:10.222]  These people have worked very hard to get here.
[02:50:10.262 --> 02:50:16.487]  They're working very hard on civilizational jihad and they're not going to go peacefully into that good night.
[02:50:17.227 --> 02:50:17.527]  Yeah.
[02:50:32.944 --> 02:50:33.404]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:51:02.964 --> 02:51:03.084]  It's
[02:51:23.570 --> 02:51:28.071]  I just can't believe that the leftist elites are letting it destroy, totally destroy tourism.
[02:51:28.091 --> 02:51:31.332]  Because as you know, some numbers are as high as 80% to places like Paris is gone.
[02:51:55.071 --> 02:51:57.712]  Yeah, it is amazing, but they have to be finding their funding elsewhere.
[02:51:58.293 --> 02:52:00.414]  Something is keeping them afloat.
[02:52:00.914 --> 02:52:06.217]  Yeah, I personally would not visit any of those cities at this point for pleasure.
[02:52:06.297 --> 02:52:08.098]  I would do it for work, but I wouldn't go there.
[02:52:08.278 --> 02:52:10.219]  I mean, yeah, like that footage you're rolling right there.
[02:52:10.519 --> 02:52:11.980]  This kind of stuff is happening everywhere.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:12.680]  It's terrifying.
[02:52:12.700 --> 02:52:17.123]  And that's female reporters being attacked for just going into the no-go zones.
[02:52:19.269 --> 02:52:21.610]  Just for reporting, even the press isn't safe at this point.
[02:52:21.950 --> 02:52:23.311]  Even people like Tommy Robinson.
[02:52:23.371 --> 02:52:29.393]  I mean, he's kind of been the harbinger and warning us all, and people really need to listen to the things that he has to say.
[02:52:29.413 --> 02:52:32.374]  And there are people like that all over the world now that are starting to pop up.
[02:52:32.714 --> 02:52:36.275]  Even in the governments, you have the Danish immigration minister.
[02:52:36.595 --> 02:52:39.116]  She spoke up recently, and she's pretty good.
[02:52:39.136 --> 02:52:40.597]  She's kind of hardline, and she's
[02:52:40.657 --> 02:52:41.057]  We're good.
[02:52:57.967 --> 02:52:59.568]  Well, you filed your report to us.
[02:52:59.608 --> 02:53:02.629]  In the future, you'll just do it directly to Facebook, YouTube, InfoWars.
[02:53:03.429 --> 02:53:05.029]  But you've just got back from Australia.
[02:53:05.049 --> 02:53:06.870]  You interviewed the Tommy Robinson of Australia.
[02:53:07.290 --> 02:53:11.112]  And we're going to be premiering that either today or tomorrow here on air.
[02:53:11.852 --> 02:53:13.552]  Great job, Mr. Lyman.
[02:53:13.572 --> 02:53:14.853]  Any other key points you'd like to add?
[02:53:16.149 --> 02:53:19.170]  Just like to tell everyone to stay engaged, share our articles.
[02:53:19.350 --> 02:53:22.251]  Oh, very quickly, you'd be amazed what our reach is.
[02:53:22.611 --> 02:53:25.833]  In New Zealand, real quick, I was in a very rural part of New Zealand.
[02:53:26.153 --> 02:53:38.157]  I didn't even have cell phone service, and I came across a huge placard in front of someone's driveway that had a big InfoWars label and, you know, Know the Globalism, all these slogans, and it was in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand.
[02:53:38.177 --> 02:53:41.879]  So you have no idea how far our reach is, but it is every corner of the world.
[02:53:41.939 --> 02:53:44.480]  So please share the articles and just get the word out there.
[02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:45.360]  Keep waking people up.
[02:53:45.914 --> 02:53:51.259]  About two years ago, I climbed up on some standing stones that weren't real popular to go to.
[02:53:51.279 --> 02:53:58.085]  Somebody was around off the side of the highway in southern England, and I kind of didn't like it, because I don't like graffiti on things like that.
[02:53:58.125 --> 02:54:01.187]  But carved into one of them was Infowars.com.
[02:54:02.028 --> 02:54:03.729]  And I was like, wow, that's crazy.
[02:54:03.849 --> 02:54:05.131]  And then you just see it everywhere.
[02:54:05.591 --> 02:54:07.793]  That's why the globalists demonize us.
[02:54:07.813 --> 02:54:12.277]  They're trying to shut us down, trying to misrepresent who we are, trying to make people be scared to be associated with us.
[02:54:13.493 --> 02:54:16.898]  They want a bunch of timid slobs, ladies and gentlemen, but all over the world.
[02:54:16.958 --> 02:54:26.871]  Especially, I'm told, I haven't been to Eastern Europe yet, but I'm told by Max Keiser, who by the way is on with us tomorrow, and others, that if you go to Eastern Europe, and even the Middle East, because a lot of Muslims don't want to live under orthodox Islam.
[02:54:26.911 --> 02:54:28.333]  We're talking about orthodox Islam.
[02:54:28.473 --> 02:54:29.754]  We're ubiquitous, that's for sure.
[02:54:29.774 --> 02:54:31.334]  So just keep getting the word out there.
[02:54:31.354 --> 02:54:35.896]  I think we're one of the few outlets that is willing to tell the truth about a lot of the things that are going on right now.
[02:54:54.994 --> 02:54:56.295]  Well, Dan, you're doing an amazing job.
[02:54:56.315 --> 02:54:58.558]  Just in 60 seconds, what do you make of this Iran thing?
[02:54:58.998 --> 02:55:00.400]  I mean, I'm just sick of these wars.
[02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:02.022]  We elected Trump not to have these wars.
[02:55:02.302 --> 02:55:04.064]  But he did say he'd be tough on Iran.
[02:55:04.124 --> 02:55:06.006]  He said he wouldn't go after Syria.
[02:55:06.327 --> 02:55:07.708]  He's kind of starting to fudge on that.
[02:55:08.129 --> 02:55:10.111]  I'm still real happy with him, but I'm mad about that.
[02:55:11.452 --> 02:55:15.297]  But at the same time, this Iran situation, Netanyahu showed some pretty strong evidence.
[02:55:16.636 --> 02:55:17.036]  Definitely.
[02:55:17.216 --> 02:55:18.016]  And it's amazing.
[02:55:18.056 --> 02:55:26.438]  It seems like every time we get to catch our breath with war and see a little sliver of peace on the horizon, it seems like something new comes up.
[02:55:26.518 --> 02:55:28.718]  So it's just hit after hit.
[02:55:29.379 --> 02:55:31.839]  And I only hope for peace across the planet.
[02:55:31.859 --> 02:55:33.559]  And it's great to see what's going on in Korea.
[02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:36.180]  I'm very interested to see what plays out in Iran.
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:36.540]  We'll see.
[02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:39.981]  Well, I think that's because Trump said no more games, but we'll see what happens.
[02:55:40.021 --> 02:55:41.921]  The left and the globalists are really trying to stop us.
[02:55:41.941 --> 02:55:43.881]  Dan Lyman from EuropeWars.com.
[02:55:44.022 --> 02:55:44.702]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:44.722 --> 02:55:44.862]  Cheers.
[02:55:46.997 --> 02:55:50.839]  Really, first rate on the very front reporting there.
[02:55:50.859 --> 02:55:52.160]  He did a great job covering Davos.
[02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:54.762]  A one-man wrecking team, but we're getting some more crew for him right now.
[02:55:55.122 --> 02:55:58.124]  Speaking of getting crew, when you buy products from InfoWars, you allow this to happen.
[02:55:58.884 --> 02:56:04.207]  So, X2, Deep Earth Crystal, purest form of iodine out there in the organic palm oil.
[02:56:05.768 --> 02:56:07.969]  Unlike any other iodine out there, the good halogen.
[02:56:08.730 --> 02:56:09.530]  It is amazing.
[02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:10.511]  Experience it for yourself.
[02:56:11.031 --> 02:56:13.393]  We're having trouble getting more of the Deep Earth Crystal sources.
[02:56:14.392 --> 02:56:15.013]  It may run out.
[02:56:15.033 --> 02:56:16.696]  This only happened one other time four years ago.
[02:56:18.178 --> 02:56:20.441]  A little bit last year, but this is a serious shortage.
[02:56:22.184 --> 02:56:24.387]  If it continues, we have about a run and a half left.
[02:56:24.828 --> 02:56:29.194]  I was able to keep it on sale for another week because we got an emergency shipment of what they did have, a quick
[02:56:30.034 --> 02:56:30.574]  Half run.
[02:56:30.594 --> 02:56:39.918]  If you want X2, ladies and gentlemen, to be guaranteed to get it and have it, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[02:56:40.218 --> 02:56:41.618]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[02:56:41.639 --> 02:56:43.559]  Learn about what bad halogens do.
[02:56:43.619 --> 02:56:45.200]  Bromine, bromide, chlorine, fluoride.
[02:56:47.222 --> 02:56:47.742]  In the body.
[02:56:48.323 --> 02:56:51.645]  And how your body will absorb those instead of the good one, iodine.
[02:56:51.685 --> 02:56:53.127]  But most iodine is bound.
[02:56:53.267 --> 02:56:54.047]  Bound in salt.
[02:56:54.468 --> 02:56:55.188]  Bound in other things.
[02:56:55.208 --> 02:56:56.149]  It goes right through you.
[02:56:56.689 --> 02:56:57.490]  This is pure.
[02:56:58.010 --> 02:56:59.051]  It goes right into you.
[02:56:59.592 --> 02:57:00.752]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:01.333 --> 02:57:04.475]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:04.595 --> 02:57:06.917]  A lot of other iodines will make you sick, folks.
[02:57:06.977 --> 02:57:08.618]  So this one does anybody I know of.
[02:57:08.919 --> 02:57:11.381]  Thousands of great reviews, but you need to read about it for yourself.
[02:57:11.721 --> 02:57:12.421]  Do your own research.
[02:57:12.461 --> 02:57:13.162]  Talk to your physician.
[02:57:17.182 --> 02:57:20.843]  I mean, it's way better than a cup of coffee for me personally, for energy, for everything else, quite frankly.
[02:57:20.943 --> 02:57:21.683]  It's amazing.
[02:57:22.103 --> 02:57:23.403]  It's kind of made me spoiled rotten, though.
[02:57:23.583 --> 02:57:25.644]  I lost like 30-something pounds when I first got on it.
[02:57:25.664 --> 02:57:27.924]  And I was working out hard and couldn't lose weight.
[02:57:28.304 --> 02:57:34.946]  Now I barely work out, and I've kept my weight, even though I'm older now, 44 the same, down from 280-something to 240.
[02:57:36.006 --> 02:57:38.386]  And I work out like twice a week instead of all the time.
[02:57:38.406 --> 02:57:43.227]  I used to swim two miles a day a lot of the time, and still was a big old fatty.
[02:57:43.628 --> 02:57:45.008]  But when I got the good halogen,
[02:57:46.088 --> 02:57:47.049]  Game changer.

[02:58:56.205 --> 02:58:57.505]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:58.006 --> 02:59:09.531]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:10.231 --> 02:59:15.314]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[02:59:15.674 --> 02:59:19.138]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:59:19.558 --> 02:59:25.385]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:59:25.405 --> 02:59:30.251]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:30.751 --> 02:59:33.072]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:59:33.412 --> 02:59:34.752]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:35.173 --> 02:59:44.776]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:44.876 --> 02:59:47.017]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:59:47.557 --> 02:59:52.439]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:59:56.656 --> 03:00:09.822]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:14.705 --> 03:00:18.466]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:00:18.807 --> 03:00:22.969]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:27.297 --> 03:00:37.801]  Isn't it great to see a president being cheered for peace and for being on the very cusp of the Korean War officially being ended and the denuclearization of the peninsula?
[03:00:37.921 --> 03:00:43.363]  Isn't something like this what we want to see from a political party or a nation's people?
[03:00:43.903 --> 03:00:50.065]  Instead the Democrats are chanting for more war and they love the fact that Obama got a Peace Prize for launching seven wars.
[03:00:50.745 --> 03:00:51.385]  What a joke.
[03:00:51.465 --> 03:00:52.266]  Here's Trump.
[03:00:54.026 --> 03:00:55.547]  We're not playing games and
[03:00:57.785 --> 03:01:00.848]  I remember, you know, it was very rough three, four months ago.

[03:01:24.947 --> 03:01:25.007]  No
[03:01:26.312 --> 03:01:29.634]  And I sure hope it has bigger success, but here's South Korea's foreign minister.
[03:01:29.654 --> 03:01:32.296]  This is who the foreign minister gives credit to.
[03:01:33.276 --> 03:01:40.861]  If we would have... This is who the South Korean minister gives credit to.
[03:01:47.850 --> 03:01:50.696]  And then, well, I got Gerald Solentik coming up a little bit after that.
[03:01:51.638 --> 03:01:53.862]  And then we're going to play the clip after that, just so everybody knows.
[03:01:54.964 --> 03:01:57.069]  After this clip, we're going to go to Lindsey Graham.
[03:01:57.089 --> 03:01:57.349]  Here it is.
[03:01:58.601 --> 03:02:02.442]  Are you surprised by how quickly this moment has arrived?
[03:02:02.662 --> 03:02:10.565]  I mean, let's face it, just four months ago, Kim Jong-un was talking about pressing nuclear buttons from his desk, and President Trump was responding in kind.
[03:02:10.645 --> 03:02:15.747]  I feel like somebody stepped on the accelerator at the beginning of the year, and it's been non-stop since then.
[03:02:16.207 --> 03:02:17.227]  How do you account for it?
[03:02:18.548 --> 03:02:21.569]  Clearly, you know, credit goes to President Trump.
[03:02:21.669 --> 03:02:25.690]  He's been determined to come to grips with this from day one.
[03:02:27.870 --> 03:02:30.831]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, here.
[03:02:31.031 --> 03:02:37.734]  We're going to go to this Lindsey Graham clip here in a moment, with the heads exploding at the Liberals.
[03:02:37.774 --> 03:02:38.114]  Here it is.
[03:02:39.234 --> 03:02:49.518]  If he can lead us to ending the Korean War after 70 years and getting North Korea to give up their nuclear program in a verifiable way, he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize and then some.
[03:02:51.161 --> 03:02:52.102]  Yeah, will he get it?
[03:02:52.182 --> 03:03:01.948]  I mean, obviously, this is something that the mainstream media will push back at, but you're right, if this is actually materializing, what an enormous accomplishment for President Trump.
[03:03:01.968 --> 03:03:02.649]  I want to be there.
[03:03:03.089 --> 03:03:10.434]  It may be the first time the Nobel Peace Prize was given and there was mass casualties, because I think a lot of liberals would kill themselves if they did that.
[03:03:10.774 --> 03:03:15.237]  But the bottom line is, by any objective measure, what President Trump has done is historic.
[03:03:17.793 --> 03:03:23.316]  So there you go, he made the decision to put pressure on them instead of going along with the same policy, and now that's brought them to the peace table.
[03:03:23.356 --> 03:03:24.597]  Yeah, that'd make their heads explode.
[03:03:25.037 --> 03:03:27.859]  They might kill themselves if that's the case.
[03:03:29.060 --> 03:03:45.630]  When we come back, I'm going to get Gerald Salente's take on this to see where he thinks this is really going, where he sees the Iran thing going with this huge announcement, and what's unfolding with the whole situation with Iran and Benjamin Netanyahu and that briefing that you saw earlier.
[03:03:47.119 --> 03:03:48.440]  One last point before we go to break, though.
[03:03:49.401 --> 03:03:54.784]  We have a lot of incentives, like free shipping above $50 at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:03:54.985 --> 03:03:56.265]  50% off a lot of our best-selling items.
[03:03:56.325 --> 03:03:57.326]  It's very close to cost.
[03:03:59.688 --> 03:04:02.650]  Additional 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip on any item.
[03:04:02.670 --> 03:04:06.913]  A lot of things become loss leaders when you do AutoShip on things like coffee or supplements that you're going to want to reorder.
[03:04:07.213 --> 03:04:11.396]  Don't want to forget to get those great products that help you and your family, but also support the broadcast.
[03:04:11.416 --> 03:04:13.517]  Sign up for AutoShip and get additional 10% off.
[03:04:15.660 --> 03:04:24.565]  But at the same time, we have Patriot Points that's normally 5 cents on every dollar, which is substantive when you buy a lot of stuff.
[03:04:24.986 --> 03:04:28.308]  In the month of April, it's been 10% of every dollar.
[03:04:28.968 --> 03:04:33.091]  It goes right to your little account there on the site at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:04:33.271 --> 03:04:34.491]  It takes about a second to sign up.

[03:04:39.254 --> 03:04:41.356]  5% is a good rewards program.
[03:04:41.376 --> 03:04:43.257]  10% is nobody does that.
[03:04:44.238 --> 03:04:47.402]  So, that's about to end here in just the next day or two.
[03:04:47.883 --> 03:04:52.449]  Patriot points are doubled right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:04:53.010 --> 03:04:54.732]  InfoWarsLive.com is the same site.
[03:04:55.192 --> 03:04:56.855]  Takes you right to the sub area for the supplements.
[03:04:57.175 --> 03:04:58.397]  Gerald Cilente, straight ahead.
[03:05:03.780 --> 03:05:05.842]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:05:06.103 --> 03:05:07.424]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[03:05:07.664 --> 03:05:11.208]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[03:05:11.568 --> 03:05:19.317]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[03:05:19.517 --> 03:05:24.302]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:05:24.462 --> 03:05:29.946]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[03:05:30.286 --> 03:05:37.811]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[03:05:38.051 --> 03:05:42.474]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:05:42.774 --> 03:05:48.519]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[03:05:48.639 --> 03:05:51.602]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:05:51.802 --> 03:05:55.085]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[03:05:55.365 --> 03:05:59.028]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:06:14.787 --> 03:06:15.648]  You found it.
[03:06:16.108 --> 03:06:17.709]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:18.290 --> 03:06:20.772]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:24.735 --> 03:06:29.599]  And now, the Trends Forecaster, Gerald Cilente, is taking over for the hour.
[03:06:29.639 --> 03:06:34.763]  But I wanted to ask him, as somebody who's really traveled the world, who's really studied in-depth,
[03:06:36.115 --> 03:06:39.378]  What does he think is behind Trump going after Iran?
[03:06:39.438 --> 03:06:52.549]  What does he think is behind Netanyahu and this big presentation today with 100,000 documents and all these video displays and all these graphics that they supposedly stole with spies from the Iranians?
[03:06:53.130 --> 03:06:55.752]  I know the Iranians have been developing atomic weapons for a while.
[03:06:56.052 --> 03:06:57.894]  They were admitting it earlier, they denied it later.
[03:06:59.675 --> 03:07:02.338]  I don't think this is like lying about WMDs, but my issue is
[03:07:03.868 --> 03:07:09.729]  The argument of North Korea and Iran is, if you don't have nukes, you get invaded like Iraq, or like Syria, or like Libya.
[03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:20.092]  And so I see Saudi Arabia running the Wahhabist arm worldwide, the Sunnis, 80% of Islam, trying to invade Europe, working with the globalists, working with the socialists.
[03:07:20.752 --> 03:07:28.994]  As part of this larger jihad plan, the minority of Islam is the Shiites, 19%, the other 1% is Alawite and other minority groups, as you know.
[03:07:30.239 --> 03:07:37.907]  And so Gerald of TrendsResearch.com, I wanted to get your take as best selling author, researcher, advisor to governments about the larger strategy.
[03:07:37.927 --> 03:07:39.869]  Because I don't want Iran to nuke Israel.
[03:07:40.129 --> 03:07:42.051]  And I know Iran does a lot of belligerent things.
[03:07:42.071 --> 03:07:45.195]  And I know the Iran mullahs aren't popular and that the young people want them out.
[03:07:45.235 --> 03:07:45.895]  I get all that.
[03:07:45.915 --> 03:07:47.317]  And I'm not an enemy of Israel.
[03:07:48.868 --> 03:08:02.740]  But at the same time, this strategy of the Saudi Arabian Crown Prince coming over and doing this charm offensive, and wanting us to attack Syria to get rid of Assad, and all of this is about knocking out Saudi Arabia's enemy.
[03:08:04.083 --> 03:08:06.244]  The Shiites and Hezbollah, we know that.
[03:08:07.365 --> 03:08:10.266]  It's just that, doesn't Trump like getting cheered?
[03:08:11.087 --> 03:08:15.349]  Nobel Prize, Nobel Prize, having the South Korean President nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.
[03:08:15.769 --> 03:08:18.551]  Isn't that better than going down this war road?
[03:08:18.571 --> 03:08:26.235]  I mean, how ironic would it be, just like President-elect Obama launched seven wars, and he got a Peace Prize before he ever got into office.
[03:08:26.855 --> 03:08:28.356]  Well, will it be a sick joke where
[03:08:28.996 --> 03:08:32.219]  You know, Trump's nominated for a peace prize and launches a huge war with Iran.
[03:08:32.259 --> 03:08:35.502]  And again, I know Iran threatened to sink our ships again this week.
[03:08:35.963 --> 03:08:37.564]  I know this was a bad deal Obama did.
[03:08:37.604 --> 03:08:39.506]  I know there's a lot of double dealing going on.
[03:08:39.526 --> 03:08:49.095]  It's just at the same time, I don't want to bring down Iran and then have Saudi Arabia use that to flood Europe with its whole Islamic invasion, which we know they're doing.
[03:08:49.115 --> 03:08:51.097]  So I wanted to get your expert take on that.
[03:08:52.648 --> 03:09:10.566]  We were saying, actually, about three weeks after Trump got elected, and we were writing it in the Trends Journal and putting out trend alerts, that Israel, the United States, and Saudi Arabia were aligning to go after Iran.
[03:09:11.567 --> 03:09:15.832]  And it's really about the Saudi trip and the Israeli trip in a very big way.
[03:09:16.661 --> 03:09:24.744]  And as you pointed out, if you want to talk about radicals, look at all the ones that the Saudis have armed in the overthrow of Libya.
[03:09:24.764 --> 03:09:28.006]  That was Saudi Arabia and the Arab League.
[03:09:28.026 --> 03:09:38.410]  And then, of course, Obama, Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and Susan Rice, along with Sarkozy and Cameron, jumped on board to overthrow Qaddafi.
[03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:41.111]  It was the richest nation in Africa.
[03:09:41.744 --> 03:09:45.808]  They were a threat to no one, and they brought up that whole human rights thing.
[03:09:46.268 --> 03:09:50.833]  But ironically, as they were talking about that, Yemen was falling apart.
[03:09:51.454 --> 03:09:58.540]  And Yemen, the leader at the time, was slaughtering many more people than Qaddafi allegedly had.
[03:09:59.241 --> 03:10:02.564]  So going back to Saudi Arabia, where's Saudi Arabia?
[03:10:02.905 --> 03:10:04.086]  Well, they invaded Yemen.
[03:10:04.901 --> 03:10:07.502]  They don't like the government that's there, the Houthi government.
[03:10:07.822 --> 03:10:11.663]  And by the way, the Houthis have been there for over a thousand years.
[03:10:12.284 --> 03:10:14.284]  And Yemen just split up in the 90s.
[03:10:14.444 --> 03:10:17.506]  It was North and South at one time.
[03:10:17.526 --> 03:10:19.566]  And so that's what that's all about.
[03:10:20.006 --> 03:10:21.947]  But when did Saudi Arabia begin?
[03:10:21.967 --> 03:10:22.787]  About 1934.
[03:10:25.288 --> 03:10:31.273]  So it's this Saudi trip, and it is also going on what we've been saying.
[03:10:31.873 --> 03:10:35.516]  And again, look what's going on in Israel with the Gaza protests.
[03:10:35.976 --> 03:10:38.058]  What have they wounded, according to the reports?
[03:10:38.558 --> 03:10:40.019]  You know, about 4,000 or 5,000 people, about 45 dead.
[03:10:44.282 --> 03:10:48.025]  And, you know, they've turned that place into a Palestinian prison.
[03:10:48.065 --> 03:10:51.347]  There's no... I mean, who would want to live in those conditions?
[03:10:51.967 --> 03:10:55.090]  Alex, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:10:55.690 --> 03:10:56.971]  And that's what's going on.
[03:10:57.011 --> 03:11:01.154]  You have a real financial problem going on in Saudi Arabia.
[03:11:01.554 --> 03:11:02.835]  They need oil at $100 a barrel.
[03:11:05.430 --> 03:11:07.675]  To break even on their budget.
[03:11:08.055 --> 03:11:13.606]  And you hear the Crown Prince talking about, we want oil between $80 and $100 a barrel.
[03:11:13.626 --> 03:11:13.987]  Two thirds.
[03:11:17.495 --> 03:11:21.197]  Two-thirds of their workers are supported by the state.
[03:11:21.918 --> 03:11:30.062]  And let's be clear, just since Trump did this deal where they were going to supposedly stop funding jihadis, we now see oil gone up $15 a barrel.
[03:11:30.823 --> 03:11:32.324]  They say it's going up to $80 where they want it.
[03:11:32.844 --> 03:11:35.005]  Saudi Arabia more and more is getting what they want.
[03:11:35.285 --> 03:11:37.687]  This is the tail wagging the dog undoubtedly here.
[03:11:38.807 --> 03:11:39.588]  Exactly.
[03:11:40.508 --> 03:11:42.029]  And that's what this is about.
[03:11:42.429 --> 03:11:43.230]  What was it about?
[03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:46.252]  You've heard me say this, you think we would have invaded Iraq?
[03:11:47.347 --> 03:11:50.248]  If their major export product was broccoli?
[03:11:50.868 --> 03:11:51.028]  No.
[03:11:51.228 --> 03:11:52.409]  Same thing in Libya.
[03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:53.609]  Do you agree with me then?
[03:11:53.629 --> 03:11:54.270]  Do you agree with me?
[03:11:54.290 --> 03:12:03.693]  I mean, Iran's going off the dollar onto the euro, all the signs are there, that Netanyahu giving this speech is basically the major ramp-up to a strike on Iran.
[03:12:04.591 --> 03:12:04.891]  Yes.
[03:12:05.431 --> 03:12:08.953]  And look what just happened last night that's not in the news.
[03:12:09.613 --> 03:12:11.774]  They attacked Syria again.
[03:12:12.214 --> 03:12:18.597]  They killed over a dozen Iranians in an airbase near Aleppo, a military place.
[03:12:19.197 --> 03:12:24.720]  And they don't know who did it, whether it was the United States, Israel, or the UK.
[03:12:24.740 --> 03:12:27.341]  So they're sending missiles in again.
[03:12:27.361 --> 03:12:31.943]  And again, it's... And notice it's one missile.
[03:12:32.003 --> 03:12:33.884]  It's like a test to see if we'll even pay attention.
[03:12:35.086 --> 03:12:35.767]  Yes, here.
[03:12:36.367 --> 03:12:37.428]  This is last week.
[03:12:38.068 --> 03:12:43.032]  Israeli war with Iran increasingly likely.
[03:12:43.592 --> 03:12:44.333]  Who said that?
[03:12:45.253 --> 03:12:45.834]  Mattis.
[03:12:47.515 --> 03:12:48.736]  April 26th.
[03:12:50.017 --> 03:13:00.024]  Then we're hearing the Defense Secretary over there, Lieberman, talking about these three things that have problems.
[03:13:00.184 --> 03:13:02.246]  Iran, Iran, and Iran.
[03:13:03.493 --> 03:13:05.935]  So now Pompeo went over there.
[03:13:06.495 --> 03:13:07.476]  What did he meet with?
[03:13:07.536 --> 03:13:08.556]  The Crown Prince?
[03:13:09.037 --> 03:13:09.957]  Netanyahu?
[03:13:10.037 --> 03:13:11.318]  What are they talking about?
[03:13:11.818 --> 03:13:13.179]  Iran and war.
[03:13:13.660 --> 03:13:16.902]  Here's our forecast.
[03:13:17.162 --> 03:13:21.605]  If there's war against Iran, kiss the markets goodbye.
[03:13:21.625 --> 03:13:26.708]  Oil prices will spike back to the $150 a barrel.
[03:13:27.368 --> 03:13:29.710]  It'll crash the global economies.
[03:13:30.350 --> 03:13:32.612]  Gold prices will soar.
[03:13:33.635 --> 03:13:43.142]  And then also we're telling our subscribers, if this should happen, watch those cryptocurrencies as well, and see what they do.
[03:13:43.942 --> 03:13:47.425]  This thing is going to destroy the equity markets.
[03:13:47.765 --> 03:13:56.271]  Go back to 2008, when oil prices were going toward $150 a barrel, and BAM!
[03:13:56.591 --> 03:13:57.912]  The panic came on.
[03:13:58.352 --> 03:14:02.175]  And you already mentioned how much oil prices have gone up.
[03:14:03.081 --> 03:14:13.739]  So that's already about $500 a year already out of the pocket of the average middle class family in increased gas prices.
[03:14:14.699 --> 03:14:18.282]  And then you look at retail sales.
[03:14:18.302 --> 03:14:21.765]  Joe, we've got to go to break and I'm going to have you take over right now with your expert mind on this.
[03:14:21.785 --> 03:14:24.066]  This is why it's so good to have you here when this is all happening today.
[03:14:24.126 --> 03:14:29.811]  But if we just pull back from this, Trump will end up destroying his legacy with this Iran situation.
[03:14:29.831 --> 03:14:30.972]  It's going to be a giant war.
[03:14:31.392 --> 03:14:33.414]  Like you said, it's going to totally screw up the economy.
[03:14:33.734 --> 03:14:35.135]  The Iranians are Persian.
[03:14:35.195 --> 03:14:36.316]  It's not going to be like Iraq.
[03:14:36.596 --> 03:14:38.778]  They're going to trigger sleeper cells all over Europe.
[03:14:39.238 --> 03:14:39.358]  No.
[03:14:59.528 --> 03:15:00.148]  I really don't.
[03:15:00.509 --> 03:15:09.015]  Not from the language coming out from the Crown Prince, from Pompeo, from Bolton, and from Netanyahu and Lieberman.
[03:15:09.495 --> 03:15:10.276]  I don't see that.
[03:15:12.737 --> 03:15:15.599]  I know North Korea suddenly wanted to go along with things.
[03:15:15.659 --> 03:15:18.141]  I think they've been told, big war's coming, you better get in line.
[03:15:19.542 --> 03:15:23.645]  Yeah, you mentioned also, you said these are the Persians, they're not the Iraqis.
[03:15:25.175 --> 03:15:35.047]  And when you look again, and I've read the details, they're really truly not in violation of the UN agreement with these missile testings.
[03:15:37.011 --> 03:15:45.557]  Well, and when we say that is, a whole bunch of them will get ready to die, and they'll be more coordinated than when we're fighting the Arabs, and it's not going to be a good situation, but this is where the world's going.
[03:15:45.897 --> 03:15:47.839]  Pray for peace, folks, but prepare for war.
[03:15:48.379 --> 03:15:52.262]  More of the InfoWar with Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com.
[03:15:52.762 --> 03:15:58.767]  Be sure and check out our new site, EuropeWars.com, the latest coverage of the Islamic invasion today.
[03:16:02.631 --> 03:16:09.259]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[03:16:09.940 --> 03:16:11.742]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[03:16:12.343 --> 03:16:18.210]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[03:16:18.611 --> 03:16:21.234]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[03:16:21.514 --> 03:16:24.536]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[03:16:24.896 --> 03:16:30.819]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[03:16:31.459 --> 03:16:37.923]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[03:16:38.303 --> 03:16:44.208]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[03:16:44.669 --> 03:16:48.292]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[03:16:48.772 --> 03:16:56.979]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[03:16:57.379 --> 03:17:03.384]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:17:04.657 --> 03:17:09.081]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[03:17:09.701 --> 03:17:17.808]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[03:17:18.368 --> 03:17:20.050]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[03:17:20.590 --> 03:17:27.496]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[03:17:27.576 --> 03:17:30.579]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[03:17:31.159 --> 03:17:32.060]  It's not absorbable.
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:33.001]  It's toxic.
[03:17:33.701 --> 03:17:45.813]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[03:17:45.933 --> 03:17:48.455]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[03:17:49.196 --> 03:17:57.563]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[03:17:57.623 --> 03:18:01.726]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[03:18:02.146 --> 03:18:06.850]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[03:18:07.431 --> 03:18:10.993]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[03:18:11.294 --> 03:18:15.157]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[03:18:15.737 --> 03:18:18.478]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[03:18:18.518 --> 03:18:19.639]  We have a good supply right now.
[03:18:20.059 --> 03:18:21.420]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[03:18:21.860 --> 03:18:24.161]  But this may be the clincher.
[03:18:24.201 --> 03:18:27.423]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[03:18:27.843 --> 03:18:31.244]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[03:18:31.705 --> 03:18:33.826]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[03:18:34.166 --> 03:18:35.526]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[03:18:35.887 --> 03:18:43.250]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[03:18:43.570 --> 03:18:44.411]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:18:45.031 --> 03:18:45.191]  Yeah.
[03:19:00.247 --> 03:19:00.547]  Pure Iodine.
[03:19:00.907 --> 03:19:01.647]  Pure Iodine.
[03:19:01.747 --> 03:19:03.968]  You will end up having all sorts of disorders.
[03:19:04.268 --> 03:19:04.968]  Just like water.
[03:19:05.069 --> 03:19:05.889]  Just like oxygen.
[03:19:06.189 --> 03:19:08.330]  Without Iodine, it is an essential element.
[03:19:08.690 --> 03:19:09.930]  It's available exclusively.
[03:19:10.210 --> 03:19:14.151]  Survival Shield X2 at M4WarsLife.com and M4WarsTore.com.
[03:19:14.211 --> 03:19:15.492]  And I hope, like a few years ago...
[03:19:16.607 --> 03:19:16.767]  That's
[03:19:35.925 --> 03:19:38.707]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.

[03:20:18.100 --> 03:20:24.402]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:26.023 --> 03:20:27.663]  Hey, this is Gerald Cilenti.
[03:20:32.765 --> 03:20:35.167]  And thank you so much, Alex, for having me on.
[03:20:35.227 --> 03:20:37.088]  It's great being on InfoWars.
[03:20:37.108 --> 03:20:47.156]  And for all you listeners out there, don't forget to put your money where your mind is and buy those InfoWars products to keep the truth going.
[03:20:47.816 --> 03:20:52.920]  Because when you look at the media today, it's not, it's more than fake news.
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:53.961]  It's junk news.
[03:20:55.142 --> 03:20:56.883]  And InfoWars has real news.
[03:20:56.963 --> 03:21:00.226]  So please do what you can to keep buying those products.
[03:21:00.954 --> 03:21:15.117]  And getting the truth out there and having Alex have people like myself and others on to give the views and observations based on facts rather than buying into propaganda and belief systems.
[03:21:16.098 --> 03:21:18.458]  The motto of the Trends Journal is think for yourself.
[03:21:19.258 --> 03:21:23.979]  And Alex was mentioning before about North Korea.
[03:21:25.160 --> 03:21:26.040]  Where's that going?
[03:21:26.932 --> 03:21:41.443]  And all the data coming out, by the way, from South Korea is that, in fact, they are pointing at Trump as pushing this forward by the actions that he took earlier.
[03:21:41.463 --> 03:21:45.226]  I mean, it did seem a bit extreme, but apparently it worked.
[03:21:45.966 --> 03:21:49.709]  And it's also let's not forget, too, that China is playing a very big role in this.
[03:21:50.290 --> 03:21:51.450]  And so, too, is Russia.
[03:21:51.490 --> 03:21:53.432]  They're both on the border of North Korea.
[03:21:54.286 --> 03:21:58.470]  And their influence also is very instrumental in this.
[03:21:59.491 --> 03:22:01.734]  So, peace is the way to go.
[03:22:01.794 --> 03:22:03.195]  There's no profit in war.
[03:22:03.235 --> 03:22:04.436]  That's the big lie.
[03:22:05.057 --> 03:22:08.921]  The only people that profit are the military-industrial complex.
[03:22:09.522 --> 03:22:17.610]  As General Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star General Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces and two-term President, said
[03:22:18.348 --> 03:22:31.515]  His farewell address January 1961 at the Military-Industrial Complex was robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[03:22:32.316 --> 03:22:34.437]  So the people say, oh, there's profit in war.
[03:22:34.457 --> 03:22:35.318]  That's nonsense.
[03:22:35.918 --> 03:22:37.939]  There's only destruction in war.
[03:22:37.959 --> 03:22:40.240]  There's growth in profit and peace.
[03:22:41.381 --> 03:22:46.444]  So going back into what Alex was saying about
[03:22:49.093 --> 03:22:51.374]  The deal with North Korea.
[03:22:52.075 --> 03:22:55.917]  And we have our new guy over there, Bolton.
[03:22:57.738 --> 03:23:00.539]  And he was on the TV yesterday.
[03:23:00.559 --> 03:23:02.460]  And he said.
[03:23:02.480 --> 03:23:05.642]  A question was that.
[03:23:05.662 --> 03:23:16.328]  Is it a requirement that Kim Jong Un agreed to give away those weapons, meaning the nuclear weapons, before you give any kind of concession?
[03:23:17.448 --> 03:23:18.369]  And Bolton said.
[03:23:20.106 --> 03:23:20.987]  I think that's right.
[03:23:22.248 --> 03:23:28.134]  I think we're looking at Libya model of 2003 and 2004.
[03:23:32.097 --> 03:23:33.759]  The alarm bells go off.
[03:23:34.559 --> 03:23:37.642]  That's why North Korea got nuclear weapons.
[03:23:39.464 --> 03:23:45.690]  Because they saw what the United States, how they backtracked on the agreement,
[03:23:46.388 --> 03:23:59.758]  Just like, by the way, the United States government broke every treaty that it made with the Native Americans, they broke the treaty on that with Libya as well.
[03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:05.923]  So once he got rid of the nukes, bye-bye Qaddafi.
[03:24:06.984 --> 03:24:09.806]  And that's why North Korea got these weapons.
[03:24:10.147 --> 03:24:12.268]  They made it clear from the beginning.
[03:24:13.669 --> 03:24:15.651]  So if they're really assured
[03:24:16.758 --> 03:24:17.158]  Peace.
[03:24:17.939 --> 03:24:18.940]  That's what they want.
[03:24:19.980 --> 03:24:21.421]  They're a tiny country.
[03:24:22.502 --> 03:24:27.546]  The gross domestic product is about half the size of West Virginia's.
[03:24:28.366 --> 03:24:31.328]  They got a population about the size of Texas.
[03:24:33.029 --> 03:24:34.430]  They're a threat to nobody.
[03:24:34.771 --> 03:24:40.174]  But they are a threat to the whole region with their nuclear testing.
[03:24:40.955 --> 03:24:43.697]  And of course, last week there was a report that came out
[03:24:44.372 --> 03:24:49.396]  At the place where they did nuclear tests, the whole place collapsed under it, the laboratories and everything else.
[03:24:50.016 --> 03:24:53.318]  So China and Russia don't want these things going off around them.
[03:24:54.359 --> 03:24:55.880]  So they're all in it for this.
[03:24:56.601 --> 03:25:10.210]  And as you well know, people that have been listening to me and watching our Trends in the News broadcasts, whether they're on YouTube or subscribed to the Trends Journal, I kept saying from the beginning, North Korea is not a problem.
[03:25:11.972 --> 03:25:15.394]  If the United States attacks North Korea, say goodbye to South Korea.
[03:25:15.454 --> 03:25:16.195]  Kiss it goodbye.
[03:25:17.495 --> 03:25:26.001]  If DMZ is a couple of miles away from Seoul, South Korea with a metropolitan population of about 26 million people.
[03:25:26.781 --> 03:25:31.324]  So if you bomb North Korea, say goodbye to South Korea and kiss Japan goodbye.
[03:25:31.664 --> 03:25:35.266]  So we never saw anything happening there in terms of militarily.
[03:25:35.706 --> 03:25:41.470]  We have been saying for over a year, the flashpoint is Iran.
[03:25:43.564 --> 03:25:52.652]  And I mentioned to what our Defense Secretary Mattis said when I was on with Alex before.
[03:25:54.053 --> 03:25:56.695]  Here's some more information I want to read to you.
[03:25:57.996 --> 03:26:03.060]  This is from Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, yesterday.
[03:26:04.041 --> 03:26:05.122]  Excuse me, two days ago.
[03:26:06.863 --> 03:26:12.208]  This is the Defense Secretary of Israel.
[03:26:14.471 --> 03:26:14.991]  Lieberman.
[03:26:17.273 --> 03:26:18.895]  Israel has three problems.
[03:26:19.856 --> 03:26:21.977]  Iran, Iran and Iran.
[03:26:21.997 --> 03:26:28.143]  Iran is trying to destabilize the whole region, not only in Israel.
[03:26:29.183 --> 03:26:36.109]  Look at what's happening in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria.
[03:26:38.151 --> 03:26:41.634]  Iran supports and creates proxies around Israel.
[03:26:47.031 --> 03:26:53.337]  Hamas and Islamic Jihad would not survive one week without Iranian support.
[03:26:54.257 --> 03:26:58.861]  Well, when you go to the Islamic Jihad, you could thank Saudi Arabia for that one.
[03:27:01.624 --> 03:27:14.595]  And the United States for supporting them in the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya and then them going into Syria.
[03:27:16.667 --> 03:27:19.950]  Again, a war began by Saudi Arabia.
[03:27:22.872 --> 03:27:23.272]  Yemen?
[03:27:23.833 --> 03:27:25.074]  Lieberman's talking about?
[03:27:26.355 --> 03:27:34.421]  Look what the Saudis are doing to Yemen, with the help of the United States, supplying them the weapons, intelligence, and air refueling.
[03:27:35.922 --> 03:27:43.748]  There's a humanitarian crisis that the World Health Organization says is the worst in the world going on there now.
[03:27:44.966 --> 03:27:49.990]  So why point fingers at Iran?
[03:27:50.671 --> 03:27:51.492]  Oh, and Hezbollah?
[03:27:52.212 --> 03:27:53.994]  Eh, how did they come about?
[03:27:54.014 --> 03:28:02.081]  That's when Israel invaded Lebanon and they formed to throw Israel out.
[03:28:03.001 --> 03:28:05.103]  So let's put these things into perspective.
[03:28:08.386 --> 03:28:10.628]  We're going down a very dangerous road here.
[03:28:11.966 --> 03:28:28.110]  Not only will the markets crash and oil prices rise, not only will gold skyrocket, but this could be the greatest humanitarian crisis since World War II if it continues to escalate.
[03:28:29.390 --> 03:28:34.251]  This isn't going after Iraq or Syria or Libya.
[03:28:35.091 --> 03:28:35.831]  This is big.
[03:28:35.851 --> 03:28:39.072]  And I don't want to hear that bomb drop.
[03:28:41.049 --> 03:28:42.332]  We'll be back in a couple of minutes.
[03:28:42.352 --> 03:28:44.317]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:29:02.642 --> 03:29:10.306]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:29:11.206 --> 03:29:15.248]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:29:15.749 --> 03:29:18.090]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:29:18.890 --> 03:29:22.012]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:29:23.533 --> 03:29:35.661]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:29:36.361 --> 03:29:51.431]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:29:52.412 --> 03:29:56.136]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[03:29:56.697 --> 03:29:58.399]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:29:58.439 --> 03:30:00.682]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:30:03.829 --> 03:30:09.130]  Melania did not kick me out of the White House for installing coal-burning fireplaces.
[03:30:09.551 --> 03:30:10.731]  Fake news!
[03:30:11.411 --> 03:30:12.131]  Mr. President!
[03:30:12.872 --> 03:30:16.232]  Why are you throwing balls at my face, Kurt Cousins?
[03:30:16.452 --> 03:30:17.093]  It's Kirk.
[03:30:17.373 --> 03:30:18.533]  That's what I said, Gerd.
[03:30:19.013 --> 03:30:22.774]  I'm making you Secretary of Offense now.
[03:30:23.034 --> 03:30:25.275]  Prepare for fire and fury!
[03:30:32.486 --> 03:30:33.726]  You like that, Kirk Cousins?
[03:30:33.766 --> 03:30:34.486]  You like that?
[03:30:34.806 --> 03:30:36.027]  Well, there you have it.
[03:30:36.467 --> 03:30:37.387]  Terrific spot.
[03:30:38.367 --> 03:30:42.628]  Funny and satire without being overtly political or nasty.
[03:30:43.288 --> 03:30:45.509]  Congratulations, John D. Domenico.
[03:30:45.609 --> 03:30:51.570]  As someone who's known Donald Trump and studied his speech patterns myself for many years, you nailed it.
[03:30:51.730 --> 03:30:52.610]  You really nailed it.
[03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:54.830]  Thank you very much, Roger.
[03:30:54.870 --> 03:30:57.291]  I'm very excited to be on the show, I have to tell you.
[03:30:59.205 --> 03:31:15.099]  Well, I've been doing Trump since 2004, right around the end of the first season of The Apprentice, when there was a big demand corporately for Trump to come in and roast people and do apprentice games and things like that.
[03:31:15.199 --> 03:31:20.524]  So I've had a really long runway with him and to learn his voice and to really
[03:31:21.344 --> 03:31:24.105]  Get it down, especially these last two and a half years.
[03:31:24.446 --> 03:31:31.389]  Since he's announced, he's become more physical and his speech has become more him.
[03:31:31.409 --> 03:31:35.190]  It seems like he seems like he was very restricted on The Apprentice.
[03:31:35.230 --> 03:31:38.132]  Blue team, green team, he did a good job.
[03:31:38.172 --> 03:31:39.712]  But blue team, you're fired.
[03:31:39.732 --> 03:31:43.634]  It was kind of, he seems so big in a way.
[03:31:43.994 --> 03:31:53.139]  Since I had been doing him for so long, I had done him in so many other platforms, that when he announced, I wanted to make sure that he was 100% in the race.
[03:31:53.559 --> 03:31:55.920]  And I thought to myself, you know, if he can make it to the first
[03:31:56.730 --> 03:32:13.840]  If he can make it to the first debate, I'll be set for the fall, because that's how, you know, they book out months in advance for these corporate things, and as you well know, not only did he make it to the first debate, he crushed it in the first debate, and the second debate, and third debate, and then things just started taking off.
[03:32:13.880 --> 03:32:19.603]  And a friend of mine, Tom Shalhoub, who is on, he's still on Fox News, but he was on the show Red Eye,
[03:32:20.864 --> 03:32:21.624]  He brought me on.
[03:32:21.644 --> 03:32:25.087]  I think I did about 50, 60 appearances on Red Eye as Trump.
[03:32:25.347 --> 03:32:28.209]  And then because of that, I did Fox and Friends a number of times.
[03:32:28.269 --> 03:32:36.795]  So it was a great platform and we did some really wonderful comedy and then some other shows picked me up and then voiceovers and the corporate stuff.
[03:32:36.855 --> 03:32:40.298]  And it's been kind of, it's pretty much taken over my, there's Tom right now.
[03:32:40.618 --> 03:32:42.699]  Tom Shalhoub, a very funny guy in his own right.
[03:32:42.759 --> 03:32:47.341]  Well, as you know, the pundits in the mainstream didn't see Trump coming.
[03:32:47.461 --> 03:32:49.922]  So, I can see why it started slowly.
[03:32:50.442 --> 03:32:53.323]  They were the last people in the world who thought that he would win.
[03:32:53.363 --> 03:32:53.763]  What was it?
[03:32:53.823 --> 03:32:55.484]  Jeb Bush said, you're not going to elect a president?
[03:32:55.504 --> 03:32:57.305]  You're not going to insult your way into the presidency?
[03:32:57.985 --> 03:32:58.785]  Guess what, Jeb?
[03:32:59.345 --> 03:32:59.886]  Wrong.
[03:33:00.446 --> 03:33:00.926]  Wrong.
[03:33:05.628 --> 03:33:08.269]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.912 --> 03:33:18.114]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:18.614 --> 03:33:23.818]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:27.921 --> 03:33:29.622]  Hey, welcome back, welcome back.
[03:33:31.103 --> 03:33:36.808]  So, again we're talking about the heating up of the war in the Middle East.
[03:33:38.564 --> 03:33:50.886]  And again, this is from last week, that having met with his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, U.S.
[03:33:50.926 --> 03:34:01.148]  Secretary of Defense James Mattis, warns he sees an Israeli war with Iran as, quote, very likely.
[03:34:03.868 --> 03:34:07.069]  He cited Iran's presence in Syria
[03:34:08.189 --> 03:34:10.369]  As the likely cause of the fight.
[03:34:14.370 --> 03:34:24.952]  So, Mattis added, we hope Iran would pull back rather than risk Israeli attacks.
[03:34:30.113 --> 03:34:34.194]  Pompeo says Trump unlikely to stay in Iran deal.
[03:34:39.330 --> 03:34:40.590]  And we keep going here.
[03:34:40.610 --> 03:34:49.812]  This is from Aharetz, the Israeli newspaper.
[03:34:50.672 --> 03:34:54.513]  This is quoting our new Secretary of State, Pompeo.
[03:34:56.793 --> 03:34:57.853]  He said that U.S.
[03:34:57.933 --> 03:35:00.274]  stands with Israel against Iran.
[03:35:01.034 --> 03:35:08.515]  We remain deeply concerned about Iran's dangerous escalation of threats toward Israel and the region.
[03:35:12.352 --> 03:35:13.393]  So what's the region?
[03:35:14.934 --> 03:35:15.695]  Well, Syria.
[03:35:17.296 --> 03:35:20.138]  And Saudi Arabia and the United States want Iran out?
[03:35:20.278 --> 03:35:21.719]  They want all the Middle East.
[03:35:22.200 --> 03:35:23.020]  End of story.
[03:35:24.261 --> 03:35:29.025]  This is this guy, again, the Defense Secretary of Israel, Lieberman.
[03:35:32.728 --> 03:35:36.350]  Again, to repeat it, he said we have three problems.
[03:35:36.731 --> 03:35:39.433]  Iran, Iran, and Iran.
[03:35:43.274 --> 03:35:46.477]  And going on here, some more quotes.
[03:35:49.499 --> 03:36:00.968]  Pompeo saying the United States is deeply concerned about Iran's dangerous escalation of threats to Israel and the region and Iran's ambition to dominate the Middle East.
[03:36:01.928 --> 03:36:09.915]  How dare they try to dominate the Middle East when the United States and the Allies are, I know it's French, they can't get over that trip either, man.
[03:36:10.335 --> 03:36:12.196]  Back into colonization times.
[03:36:12.276 --> 03:36:12.937]  Matter of fact,
[03:36:13.624 --> 03:36:17.985]  Words out, they're sending troops into Syria and they're already there.
[03:36:20.765 --> 03:36:22.206]  And what else do we have here?
[03:36:25.406 --> 03:36:31.528]  Trump, Netanyahu speak on phone to discuss Middle East tensions.
[03:36:35.208 --> 03:36:37.789]  And it keeps going on and on about
[03:36:39.042 --> 03:36:45.905]  Iran's regime destabilizing activities, and that is a quote.
[03:36:48.286 --> 03:36:52.648]  Israel on high alert prepares a possible Iranian retaliation.
[03:36:52.668 --> 03:36:57.170]  This is a few weeks ago after strike on Syrian base.
[03:36:57.731 --> 03:37:03.753]  So they struck a Syrian base, killed about eight people, and now they're looking for retaliation.
[03:37:04.434 --> 03:37:04.854]  Who wouldn't?
[03:37:06.329 --> 03:37:20.616]  So, thanks for tuning in, and don't forget, we got a lot more to go here, but just to remind you, that what keeps InfoWars going, to some extent, are the wonderful products that they have available.
[03:37:21.377 --> 03:37:24.458]  And one of my private products is right here.
[03:37:24.478 --> 03:37:29.161]  You know, I don't know who said it, but I actually do, Mr. Boogie.
[03:37:29.681 --> 03:37:33.363]  He said, you gotta boogie before the lights go out, because tomorrow is iffy.
[03:37:33.683 --> 03:37:35.344]  And you can see by this news, man.
[03:37:36.616 --> 03:37:37.777]  If he's putting it light.
[03:37:38.237 --> 03:37:39.358]  So I like to boogie.
[03:37:39.378 --> 03:37:43.262]  Because I write about and read about all the ugly stuff going on.
[03:37:43.762 --> 03:37:48.346]  So I want to keep my vitality, full male strength going.
[03:37:49.227 --> 03:37:52.349]  I hope Me Too doesn't try to stop this from happening.
[03:37:52.750 --> 03:37:55.352]  But I love male vitality.
[03:37:56.012 --> 03:37:59.095]  It keeps me vital, active, and really going.
[03:37:59.155 --> 03:38:01.177]  And they have an incredible special offer.
[03:38:02.060 --> 03:38:09.246]  On Supermail Vitality, the 50% off at InfoWarsStores.com.
[03:38:09.807 --> 03:38:17.293]  So I'm going to have to order me some more as well, because I believe in the products that InfoWars is selling.
[03:38:17.933 --> 03:38:28.061]  And to help you, again, to support this broadcast and get the best all natural products, they're dropping Supermail Vitality by 50% at
[03:38:30.467 --> 03:38:32.888]  Infowarsstores.com.
[03:38:32.908 --> 03:38:36.129]  That's right, Infowarsstores.com.
[03:38:36.989 --> 03:38:48.652]  Supermail Vitality has received thousands of five-star reviews from listeners who've been blown away by their effects, and I'm one of those listeners.
[03:38:48.832 --> 03:38:49.552]  Boop-bop-ba-dop.
[03:38:49.933 --> 03:38:51.233]  Keeps me loose and going.
[03:38:51.713 --> 03:38:55.374]  So, Mail Vitality, again, put your money where your mind is.
[03:38:57.095 --> 03:38:58.315]  So, going back to Israel,
[03:39:00.060 --> 03:39:04.061]  Saudi Arabia and the United States with this war.
[03:39:05.542 --> 03:39:09.003]  It's going to be, could be, the war to end all wars.
[03:39:09.063 --> 03:39:12.004]  This could start a World War III.
[03:39:14.685 --> 03:39:21.627]  And Alex mentioned about Iran going off the dollar.
[03:39:21.647 --> 03:39:23.508]  Nah, it's not going to do anything.
[03:39:24.408 --> 03:39:25.908]  It doesn't make much of a difference.
[03:39:26.009 --> 03:39:27.329]  Even all this talk about
[03:39:28.733 --> 03:39:31.234]  Uh, the Petro-Yuan.
[03:39:31.254 --> 03:39:33.054]  Of course, we have the Petro-Dollar.
[03:39:33.094 --> 03:39:35.214]  That was a deal that was made by Kissinger.
[03:39:36.635 --> 03:39:38.215]  Under the Nixon administration.
[03:39:38.255 --> 03:39:42.396]  We'll protect the, uh, Saudi gang, but here's the deal.
[03:39:43.516 --> 03:39:44.696]  You gotta pay us back.
[03:39:45.737 --> 03:39:49.758]  All the oil that you sell in OPEC, it gotta be priced in dollars, capisce?
[03:39:50.438 --> 03:39:51.298]  That was the deal.
[03:39:51.698 --> 03:39:52.878]  To protect the gang.
[03:39:52.898 --> 03:39:54.799]  That's all this is over there.
[03:39:55.379 --> 03:39:56.199]  It's a gang.
[03:39:58.803 --> 03:40:01.205]  Again, they invented this group in 1934.
[03:40:02.306 --> 03:40:04.727]  Named the country after the mob family.
[03:40:06.569 --> 03:40:07.389]  The Saudis.
[03:40:08.510 --> 03:40:09.891]  The United States protected them.
[03:40:09.931 --> 03:40:10.652]  That was the deal.
[03:40:11.693 --> 03:40:13.794]  So now we have to put this into perspective.
[03:40:15.996 --> 03:40:18.337]  The reserve currency is being used.
[03:40:18.377 --> 03:40:20.639]  The United States represents over about 60%, 63%.
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:23.982]  Then the Euro.
[03:40:24.742 --> 03:40:27.044]  Now the Euro value is going down.
[03:40:28.456 --> 03:40:28.856]  Why?
[03:40:30.117 --> 03:40:32.358]  Because the economy isn't good.
[03:40:33.338 --> 03:40:44.402]  That's why they're keeping interest rates, that negative interest rates, into next year and keeping their phony bond buying scheme going.
[03:40:45.983 --> 03:40:47.844]  They're buying corporate bonds.
[03:40:47.884 --> 03:40:48.984]  These aren't governments.
[03:40:50.213 --> 03:40:53.234]  It's fascism, the merger of state and corporate governments.
[03:40:53.654 --> 03:40:59.517]  They're keeping the big guys afloat, keeping the equity markets going by juicing them with cheap dough.
[03:41:00.337 --> 03:41:17.824]  Now, let's keep going back to Iran pulling away from the dollar, Russia's selling and buying its oil in the currencies, China with the Petro-Yuan, you could buy, we'll buy your oil, we'll pay you back in Yuan, but you could cash it into gold.
[03:41:18.698 --> 03:41:20.099]  Is that going to have an effect?
[03:41:20.499 --> 03:41:20.919]  Yes.
[03:41:22.179 --> 03:41:23.200]  An immediate one?
[03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:24.260]  No.
[03:41:25.981 --> 03:41:26.901]  Longer term?
[03:41:27.762 --> 03:41:28.242]  Yes.
[03:41:30.043 --> 03:41:45.949]  And, and, if the United States, Israel and Iran go to war, excuse me, United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia go to war against Iran,
[03:41:46.878 --> 03:41:48.658]  Watch the dollar dive.
[03:41:50.059 --> 03:41:52.899]  Watch that petro-yuan rise.
[03:41:54.920 --> 03:42:06.023]  And again, gold prices, they'll break into new territory, into the $2,000 range.
[03:42:09.103 --> 03:42:12.124]  Equity markets overvalued, overleveraged.
[03:42:13.351 --> 03:42:15.911]  By the way, the news Apple stock just went up.
[03:42:15.951 --> 03:42:16.592]  You know why?
[03:42:17.252 --> 03:42:18.872]  More stock buybacks.
[03:42:20.372 --> 03:42:23.413]  That's where the dough is going for the tax repatriation.
[03:42:25.053 --> 03:42:26.813]  So it's not being built on strength.
[03:42:27.834 --> 03:42:35.815]  Apple just came in number six on smartphone sales in China.
[03:42:36.635 --> 03:42:39.396]  Dove from number four.
[03:42:41.156 --> 03:42:41.336]  So.
[03:42:42.685 --> 03:42:46.129]  Keep your eye on the news and stay ahead of the trends.
[03:42:47.591 --> 03:42:55.139]  Stay tuned and remember, put your money where your heart and mind is and support InfoWars.
[03:42:55.460 --> 03:42:56.301]  Buy those products.
[03:43:05.922 --> 03:43:07.763]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[03:43:07.803 --> 03:43:08.063]  Go ahead.
[03:43:08.203 --> 03:43:12.106]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[03:43:12.226 --> 03:43:17.249]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[03:43:17.789 --> 03:43:23.333]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[03:43:24.173 --> 03:43:32.439]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[03:43:33.280 --> 03:43:36.002]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[03:43:36.682 --> 03:43:40.305]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[03:43:40.405 --> 03:43:47.230]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[03:43:47.890 --> 03:43:52.034]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[03:43:52.454 --> 03:43:55.738]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[03:43:56.438 --> 03:44:00.702]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[03:44:01.203 --> 03:44:06.788]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[03:44:06.848 --> 03:44:11.372]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[03:44:12.230 --> 03:44:13.532]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[03:44:13.732 --> 03:44:19.038]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[03:44:19.058 --> 03:44:20.379]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[03:44:20.420 --> 03:44:20.580]  Yeah.
[03:44:20.740 --> 03:44:22.622]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[03:44:22.662 --> 03:44:23.483]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[03:44:23.523 --> 03:44:25.205]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[03:44:25.245 --> 03:44:26.206]  We really appreciate you.
[03:44:26.587 --> 03:44:27.267]  Keep up the fight.
[03:44:27.288 --> 03:44:28.709]  We need to take California back.
[03:44:28.729 --> 03:44:29.110]  Thank you, Desiree.
[03:44:29.130 --> 03:44:30.211]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[03:44:30.251 --> 03:44:30.852]  Thank you, sweetheart.

[03:45:00.735 --> 03:45:04.880]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[03:45:04.900 --> 03:45:06.302]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[03:45:06.522 --> 03:45:10.427]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[03:45:10.447 --> 03:45:18.136]  And again, you look at the studies, testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.

[03:47:35.265 --> 03:47:39.626]  And I want to thank Alex Jones and the crew at InfoWars for having me on.
[03:47:40.386 --> 03:47:42.867]  And remember, great products.
[03:47:43.567 --> 03:47:46.448]  Keep doing all you can to support InfoWars.
[03:47:47.348 --> 03:47:52.009]  And again, today the big news is what's going on in the Middle East, particularly with Israel.
[03:47:53.229 --> 03:48:00.415]  Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.
[03:48:01.636 --> 03:48:07.300]  And last night, there was a missile attack against Syrian bases.
[03:48:10.022 --> 03:48:18.969]  And one of the things I do as a trend forecaster, I go to the world to try to find the news and look up the information.
[03:48:19.710 --> 03:48:28.994]  Whatever makes sense to me after reading enough of it and finding enough facts, whatever facts are, and it can be trusted, I try to make an analysis on them.
[03:48:29.535 --> 03:48:31.435]  So I don't have an agenda when I'm looking.
[03:48:32.076 --> 03:48:33.476]  I'm just looking and searching.
[03:48:35.397 --> 03:48:42.701]  And one of the agencies I go to for news is Fars News Agency, which is the Iranian one.
[03:48:43.981 --> 03:48:45.682]  And here's their report from last night.
[03:48:47.492 --> 03:48:53.818]  Syrian Army positions come under missile fire attacks in Hama and Aleppo.
[03:48:55.039 --> 03:49:06.569]  The Syrian Army positions in Hama and Aleppo were heavily pounded by missiles on Sunday night, the Damascus-based Sana'a News Agency reported.
[03:49:07.970 --> 03:49:12.374]  Now, they're saying some 200 missiles were fired and there was almost earthquakes.
[03:49:12.514 --> 03:49:13.515]  It was so shattering.
[03:49:16.326 --> 03:49:24.351]  No one yet has admitted the responsibility for the attacks, but militant news outlets and social media networks said the U.S.
[03:49:24.391 --> 03:49:31.496]  has fired the missiles from al-Tanf border crossing in eastern Syria.
[03:49:32.216 --> 03:49:36.739]  Some other sources said the missile attacks were carried out by the U.S.
[03:49:37.820 --> 03:49:43.964]  and in response to the Syria's armies advanced east of the Euphrates against the Kurdish-dominated
[03:49:44.642 --> 03:49:46.302]  Syrian Democratic Forces.
[03:49:47.263 --> 03:49:59.325]  Other sources said that Israel, that had previously targeted the T-4 air base in Homs province, where the Iranian troops had been stationed, has been behind the missile attacks.
[03:50:00.905 --> 03:50:03.446]  Twelve soldiers have been killed and many more wounded.
[03:50:05.206 --> 03:50:13.168]  Several Iranian advisers and more than a dozen civilians who live in a village adjacent
[03:50:13.888 --> 03:50:18.449]  To the Hama Depot had been killed in the raid.
[03:50:20.270 --> 03:50:21.810]  Okay, we can see where this is going.
[03:50:22.791 --> 03:50:23.691]  It's escalating.
[03:50:26.892 --> 03:50:30.813]  There's no advancement of society with more wars.
[03:50:31.573 --> 03:50:33.794]  What will come out of it is no good.
[03:50:35.834 --> 03:50:38.115]  We're in Afghanistan now going on 17 years.
[03:50:38.135 --> 03:50:38.495]  Iraq since 2003.
[03:50:42.509 --> 03:50:44.411]  Libya has been destroyed.
[03:50:44.571 --> 03:50:45.451]  It's a hellhole.
[03:50:46.632 --> 03:50:48.694]  It was the richest nation in Africa.
[03:50:50.895 --> 03:50:53.677]  So, we need peace.
[03:50:55.619 --> 03:50:57.860]  And this isn't the way or the path to it.
[03:51:00.422 --> 03:51:05.366]  There is discrepancy about whether or not Iran is allowed to test ballistic missiles.
[03:51:09.122 --> 03:51:17.966]  If they're not carrying nuclear weapons designed to do so, they are, according to the information I've read from the United Nations, allowed to do that.
[03:51:19.727 --> 03:51:36.896]  According to the reports coming in, according to all of the analysis by the monitoring agencies, they have not, again, that's according to the agencies, have not violated the principles
[03:51:38.055 --> 03:51:39.556]  Of the deal that they made.
[03:51:43.259 --> 03:51:45.060]  Cutting back on nuclear development.
[03:51:46.101 --> 03:51:49.464]  Again, I think this has more to do with the decline of Netanyahu.
[03:51:50.384 --> 03:51:53.207]  The craziness of what's going on in Saudi Arabia.
[03:51:54.768 --> 03:51:59.471]  And whatever the United States military-industrial complex has to do with it.
[03:52:00.512 --> 03:52:06.637]  There's a clip going around about Rand Paul being on with Mouse Blitzer on CNN.
[03:52:07.816 --> 03:52:26.051]  Back in 2016, when Rand Paul came out against the war in Yemen, and Maus said to him, in words you could look it up, well that'll hurt sales from arms manufacturers and that will cause a loss of jobs in the United States.
[03:52:27.072 --> 03:52:28.593]  That's how sick that clown is.
[03:52:29.674 --> 03:52:34.098]  So, again, it's always great to be here and to keep these shows going.
[03:52:34.798 --> 03:52:38.799]  It's very important that you buy the products from InfoWars.
[03:52:39.419 --> 03:52:48.162]  And they're introducing the Vitality and Balance Pack and True Alpha Mail Pack, both 50% off.
[03:52:48.782 --> 03:52:55.344]  And you better get these before Me Too finds them, because they could be all against True Alpha Mail Pack.
[03:52:55.664 --> 03:52:56.644]  We gotta go neutral!
[03:52:56.924 --> 03:52:58.184]  No mails allowed!
[03:52:59.165 --> 03:52:59.265]  Ah!
[03:52:59.885 --> 03:53:00.505]  This stuff.
[03:53:01.266 --> 03:53:04.747]  Yeah, look, I'm all against abuse, you know, of any level.
[03:53:05.708 --> 03:53:11.510]  But boy, I think it's gone, you know, into a realm that who would have ever thought?
[03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:15.132]  Again, you can't sing any of those songs when I was a young guy.
[03:53:15.752 --> 03:53:19.193]  Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by.
[03:53:19.213 --> 03:53:21.214]  Oh, how dare you get him arrested?
[03:53:21.634 --> 03:53:30.178]  So anyway, you better get your vitality and balance pack and true alpha male pack now because both
[03:53:30.799 --> 03:53:33.001]  Both 50% off.
[03:53:33.921 --> 03:53:48.552]  And they're bringing you new ways to save big on your favorite products with our new InfoWars Life Vitality and Balance and True Alpha Mail Pack, both 50% off.
[03:53:49.072 --> 03:53:58.098]  Two powerhouse combos to boost your vitality and support your body where it needs it.
[03:53:58.659 --> 03:53:58.919]  Yes!
[03:54:00.990 --> 03:54:01.510]  Here we are.
[03:54:02.131 --> 03:54:02.631]  OK.
[03:54:03.491 --> 03:54:06.553]  Now, let's go back to the economy.
[03:54:09.575 --> 03:54:15.518]  We're in a period now where we believe the Trump rally has peaked.
[03:54:17.979 --> 03:54:23.682]  There's going to continue to be increases, but volatility is now the name of the game.
[03:54:25.183 --> 03:54:28.205]  Again, the markets are overvalued and overleveraged.
[03:54:28.874 --> 03:54:46.427]  With the ETFs, on the over-leveraged side is one of them, and overvalued by their price-earnings ratio, according to people like Schiller, who says that they are records now that almost compare to the dot-com bust in the crash of 29.
[03:54:48.429 --> 03:54:51.171]  And what's juicing the markets are the stock buybacks.
[03:54:55.046 --> 03:54:59.468]  We believe that that will keep the markets going.
[03:55:00.468 --> 03:55:04.849]  The GDP numbers that are coming in are better, but they're not that strong.
[03:55:07.050 --> 03:55:09.931]  We also heard from Japan last week.
[03:55:11.092 --> 03:55:19.935]  The head of the Bank of Japan, Kuroda, said they were going to stay in negative interest rates and negative bond yields.
[03:55:21.875 --> 03:55:23.776]  The growth is not there.
[03:55:26.624 --> 03:55:28.605]  Now, let's put it all together.
[03:55:30.306 --> 03:55:35.930]  Again, the ECB last week said they're going to keep interest rates still negative.
[03:55:36.150 --> 03:55:38.591]  And this is a war on savers, by the way.
[03:55:39.051 --> 03:55:41.613]  We have no place to put our money, but they don't care.
[03:55:41.933 --> 03:55:46.236]  They want all the monies going to equity markets so the rich get richer.
[03:55:46.576 --> 03:55:47.656]  End of story.
[03:55:48.197 --> 03:55:49.638]  And the bigs get bigger.
[03:55:51.459 --> 03:55:53.480]  So as we see what's happening,
[03:55:54.927 --> 03:56:19.380]  With the markets going up because they're being juiced, we see this as a temporary juice item in the states because of Trump's omnibus budget that increased the debt level by $1.5 trillion, or I should say that $1.5 trillion omnibus budget.
[03:56:20.741 --> 03:56:22.482]  Now, that's going to juice the economy.
[03:56:24.488 --> 03:56:44.561]  However, according to the Brookings Institute study, and I could go by what's out there, they say that the average tax saving for an American middle-class family, the Trump plan, is the grand total of about 930 bucks.
[03:56:45.702 --> 03:56:48.864]  They lost that already with the rise of gas prices just this year.
[03:56:50.345 --> 03:56:52.286]  If gas prices keep increasing,
[03:56:53.430 --> 03:56:59.092]  And if there's war, kiss the economy goodbye.
[03:56:59.112 --> 03:57:02.834]  Kiss the markets goodbye.
[03:57:02.854 --> 03:57:06.195]  Again, gold prices to rise.
[03:57:06.555 --> 03:57:08.176]  Here's our forecast for gold.
[03:57:08.536 --> 03:57:10.797]  It has to go over $1,385 an ounce.
[03:57:11.437 --> 03:57:17.120]  Once it breaks that, the big breakout point is $1,450 an ounce.
[03:57:18.240 --> 03:57:22.362]  When it stabilizes above that, shoom, bop, boom.
[03:57:23.473 --> 03:57:24.153]  Big rides.
[03:57:24.614 --> 03:57:25.694]  So thanks for having me.
[03:57:26.875 --> 03:57:28.736]  See you next, what, two weeks?
[03:57:29.336 --> 03:57:31.437]  And remember, support InfoWars.

[03:57:38.141 --> 03:57:38.761]  Thank you again.
[03:57:38.781 --> 03:57:39.982]  This is Gerald Solenti.
[03:57:40.002 --> 03:57:44.985]  And remember, OccupyPeace.com in this time of war.
[03:57:52.438 --> 03:57:55.099]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[03:57:55.499 --> 03:58:00.641]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[03:58:01.321 --> 03:58:04.243]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[03:58:04.683 --> 03:58:08.204]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[03:58:08.824 --> 03:58:20.089]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[03:58:20.729 --> 03:58:31.474]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
