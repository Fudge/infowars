[00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:19.535]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:28.561]  You know, I don't say this a lot on air, even though I should probably start every broadcast by saying it.
[00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:31.543]  Because I really don't care what the enemy thinks.
[00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:33.505]  I know they don't listen to me anyways.
[00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:35.166]  They're so delusional.
[00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.787]  But the listeners need to know this.
[00:00:39.587 --> 00:00:41.248]  The listeners need to understand this.
[00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:50.391]  Because you are the activist, you are the resistance, you are America, you are the Renaissance, you are the light in the country's eyes.
[00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:51.572]  You're the spirit.
[00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:58.315]  Of 1776, you are the descendants.
[00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:04.317]  Whether you weren't even related to those people as an American, you can take on that amazing historical birthright of Providence.
[00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:12.990]  God loves children, drunks, the United States of America, as Von Bismarck said.
[00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:27.562]  But, getting back to the main issue, prior to all the incredible news, over the top, this country's in the middle of an absolute 21st century technological information civil war, with the globalists.
[00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:36.530]  You've got the globalist factions, and you've got just people that want to have the country be decent, and try to move forward, and try to not be evil.
[00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.051]  And we don't have a lot of, you know,
[00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:44.006]  Time to turn this around.
[00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:44.906]  We're trying to turn it around.
[00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:45.867]  We're trying to right the ship.
[00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:49.248]  But it's not some heroic thing to right the ship.
[00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:50.808]  It's survival instinct.
[00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.790]  And that's what I'm getting at here for people.
[00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:03.633]  When I get attacked and I get lied about in really unbelievable ways that really only somebody like
[00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:06.334]  Trump has to go through.
[00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:09.756]  It's done because they fear the information.
[00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:13.098]  They fear the platform because it gives you a voice, a bigger voice.
[00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:14.899]  And they fear the guests we have on.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:27.026]  But folks think that when I'm being destroyed ritualistically every day in the media, that I'm losing or you're losing.
[00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.107]  And we're not.
[00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:29.248]  We're taking the culture back.
[00:02:30.782 --> 00:02:37.246]  We're putting ideas into the ether that are now becoming the dominant understanding and are changing the world.
[00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:39.428]  We're exposing world government, the fact that it's unelected.
[00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:43.850]  We're exposing that the globalists are very satanic and anti-God and anti-family.
[00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:45.732]  And we're winning.
[00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:51.675]  And we're forcing them to engage in Chinese government-style, communist-style censorship.
[00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:53.036]  We're forcing their hand.
[00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:56.759]  And it's blowing up in their face big time.
[00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.121]  And I can list a bunch of those examples when we come back from break.
[00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:06.806]  So when I say I'm honored to be lied about and attacked, this is 21st century war.
[00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:12.770]  And I'm not having to get arms and legs blown off like soldiers have going back to the start of this country.
[00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.991]  Millions and millions of dead.
[00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:21.336]  And all the other men and women that have fought for their families and fought for justice throughout history, all that blood, sweat, and tears.
[00:03:23.477 --> 00:03:25.079]  This is Hillary Clinton striking back.
[00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.962]  And if it's not sending a hit team to kill me, because she knows she could get caught in this modern system.
[00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:36.501]  If it's just trying to destroy my name to be able to get the word out, that's fine.
[00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:40.784]  See, I'm willing to sacrifice myself so that we beat these people.
[00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:42.666]  And that's out of pure survival.
[00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:44.147]  Not out of being a hero.
[00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:46.610]  Our back is against the wall, folks.
[00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.912]  You can't even submit to these people.
[00:03:48.952 --> 00:03:51.694]  They just want total tyranny and to disease your mind.
[00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:53.075]  They want mental illness.
[00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:53.936]  They want collapse.
[00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:55.137]  That's their plan.
[00:03:55.858 --> 00:03:57.059]  It's public.
[00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.813]  So there is not even capitulation.
[00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:02.618]  It's not like we're going to be assimilated by this new world order.
[00:04:02.678 --> 00:04:03.760]  It wants us out of the way.
[00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:08.268]  It's got all the characteristics of an alien force.
[00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.510]  Operating through humans.
[00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.110]  And everybody knows that.
[00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.091]  Every culture knows that.
[00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:15.411]  And that's what the Bible says.
[00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:16.092]  That's what it is.
[00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:17.452]  Fallen angel.
[00:04:17.973 --> 00:04:20.234]  Now, I don't get into UFOs and all this other stuff.
[00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:27.217]  I'm just telling you, we're dealing with an off-world force that wants us to kill each other, and wants us mentally ill, and doesn't want us to work together.
[00:04:27.837 --> 00:04:35.201]  And you read the WikiLeaks, it's written like an alien would write something to turn the people against themselves and blow the planet up.
[00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:38.669]  So, it's that.
[00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:44.354]  I mean, I'm on a suicide mission because it's total death if we lose for everybody.
[00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.518]  So, I'm winning, you're winning, we're winning.
[00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.304]  They just want to make it look like you stand up and promote freedom and expose the deep state, you're going to be destroyed.
[00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:56.065]  The truth is they're the ones being destroyed.
[00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:58.267]  I rise every day like the phoenix.
[00:04:58.528 --> 00:04:59.709]  Every day I come back.
[00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:11.660]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:05:33.888 --> 00:05:38.590]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.

[00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:20.374]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:52.716]  It's already March 2nd.
[00:06:55.418 --> 00:06:56.359]  The Ides of March.
[00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:02.884]  That's when they killed Julius Caesar.
[00:07:02.904 --> 00:07:05.566]  Right in the middle of March.
[00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.187]  Beware the Ides of March.
[00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:14.172]  Are we about to see the fall of President Trump?
[00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:27.404]  I don't go with the hype with CNN and all the other globalist run, disinformation outfits, propaganda.
[00:07:32.506 --> 00:07:33.967]  But I can sense the will of the people.
[00:07:34.047 --> 00:07:48.195]  I can pick up the spirit of the population and I can talk to the man and woman on the street and I can tell you that Trump has dented
[00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:50.504]  He is aura.
[00:07:52.726 --> 00:08:05.915]  He has put a big fat dent and a big old goose egg right on top of his head with a hammer with the statements he's been making in these
[00:08:11.877 --> 00:08:18.080]  Listening sessions he's been having with victims of the shooting and also members of Congress.
[00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:27.646]  Dianne Feinstein hunched over like the archetypal witch without even wearing the green makeup looking more witch-like than the witch in The Wizard of Oz.
[00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:31.528]  And you gotta ask, why is he doing that?
[00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:38.412]  I made some phone calls this morning and last night and he said, listen, it's Ivanka and it's Jared.
[00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:41.523]  And I don't want to sit here and bash Ivanka and Jared.
[00:08:41.864 --> 00:08:42.704]  They're from New York.
[00:08:42.744 --> 00:08:44.626]  They grew up basically in little glass fishbowls.
[00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:50.610]  And to a goldfish that lives in a tiny little fishbowl, they think guns are scary.
[00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.271]  I mean, I get it.
[00:08:52.972 --> 00:08:53.913]  You're domesticated.
[00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:59.557]  And your idea of fun is shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.662]  And you're all suave and
[00:09:08.587 --> 00:09:09.408]  Fancy-pantsed.
[00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:20.094]  It sounds reasonable to give a little up, but all of us know the goal is to always have us give up, give up, give up, give up, and take bites out of it until it's all gone.
[00:09:20.414 --> 00:09:31.641]  And we've got Dianne Feinstein, and we've got Michael Moore, and we've got the New York Times, and we've got Chuck Todd on the Sunday morning shows saying, we're going to repeal the entire thing and take all your guns.
[00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:37.245]  And we know about the UN treaty that Obama signed that says the abolition of civilian firearms
[00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:39.411]  Is our goal.
[00:09:40.031 --> 00:09:53.895]  Quote, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:57.397]  What is a power monopoly?
[00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:01.898]  Well, if you've got a fish in a fish bowl,
[00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:10.668]  If you don't give it food, and if you don't give it water to keep the water filled, when it evaporates, it will surely die.
[00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:17.993]  And when you have a goldfish, it is a lesson to your children of a monopoly of power.
[00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:26.179]  Because if you don't feed little Goldie, little Goldie's gonna shrivel up like a skeleton.
[00:10:28.134 --> 00:10:36.176]  Can't tell me how many times I'll be over to a kid's house or at a party or, you know, some place and see a starving goldfish or a couple of them all skinny and looking out for food.
[00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:39.057]  Hey, why don't you feed your fish or why don't you go dump them in the lake?
[00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:45.899]  And that's kind of what leftism is.
[00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:47.259]  They want to run everything.
[00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:48.320]  They're control freaks.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.401]  They're like collectors, people that collect, you know, 400 dogs and cats or whatever.
[00:10:52.481 --> 00:10:56.062]  There's feces three feet tall and they just got to have more, more, more.
[00:10:56.142 --> 00:10:56.742]  It's mental illness.
[00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:00.138]  And that's what Satanism is.
[00:11:00.198 --> 00:11:00.998]  They want dominance.
[00:11:01.018 --> 00:11:01.679]  They want power.
[00:11:01.699 --> 00:11:03.039]  They don't want any responsibility.
[00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:06.641]  And they want to wreck things and control them.
[00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:16.905]  And they want to look over and see a bunch of starving, yapping dogs begging to them in some dirty, flea-infested yard because it makes them feel powerful.
[00:11:18.626 --> 00:11:20.047]  Notice that about mentally ill people.
[00:11:20.407 --> 00:11:22.428]  They like to mistreat animals.
[00:11:29.246 --> 00:11:29.927]  And that's what it is.
[00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:35.351]  And so, I don't blame Ivanka and Jared.
[00:11:35.391 --> 00:11:36.091]  They're goldfish.
[00:11:38.153 --> 00:11:40.355]  And I guess you could say Donald Trump looks like a big goldfish.
[00:11:40.915 --> 00:11:48.421]  But, getting serious here, Trump, he is no goldfish.
[00:11:49.302 --> 00:11:50.283]  And his sons aren't either.
[00:11:51.325 --> 00:12:00.471]  And when you've got Eric Trump running around saying, well, I think not letting folks buy semi-automatic rifles until they're 21 is reasonable and bump stocks, ban those.
[00:12:01.432 --> 00:12:04.174]  What happens then every time somebody uses something in a crime?
[00:12:04.194 --> 00:12:04.874]  We got to ban that?
[00:12:04.954 --> 00:12:12.259]  Well, there won't be any baseball bats or screwdrivers or butcher knives or cars or anything.
[00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:19.584]  So, let's just stop right there.
[00:12:21.277 --> 00:12:22.098]  And look at where we are.
[00:12:26.224 --> 00:12:28.687]  There are a lot of signs that Trump is starting to buckle.
[00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:35.816]  And we've had sources that have been worried about him being compromised.
[00:12:37.162 --> 00:12:38.444]  for you.
[00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:55.983]  For what they're individually doing, it doesn't hurt somebody else.
[00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:57.004]  I judge them by their fruits.
[00:12:57.284 --> 00:12:58.104]  Because I've read the Bible.
[00:12:58.225 --> 00:12:59.766]  You look at people like King David.
[00:13:00.266 --> 00:13:03.108]  Again, who had the same problem Donald Trump does.
[00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:07.091]  But his heart was good, so God said he was chief among men.
[00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:09.873]  So you have to really read the Bible to understand it.
[00:13:10.174 --> 00:13:11.935]  It's not hypocritical, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:13.816 --> 00:13:21.142]  America, because Trump wasn't a hypocrite, and said he stood up for these things, and did stand up for them,
[00:13:23.462 --> 00:13:25.663]  Gave him a pass on some of the moral issues.
[00:13:28.745 --> 00:13:33.788]  But we're in a society where the vice president won't get on an elevator with an unattended woman.
[00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.829]  That's one step away from Burkus, but I understand why he's doing it.
[00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:49.396]  But this whole crazed behavior about men and women coming together is from the left, is going so far left, it's coming back to basically orthodox Islam.
[00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:58.566]  I mean, where a woman hugs you and if you touch their back, Prairie Home Companion, you're fired.
[00:13:58.866 --> 00:14:00.027]  And they said, no, that's what he did.
[00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:04.350]  He touched a woman's back when she was fawning over him.
[00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:11.235]  It's like saying women throwing their panties at Elvis Presley, climbing up on top of him if Elvis hugged one of them.
[00:14:11.295 --> 00:14:12.135]  Oh my God, it's rape.
[00:14:13.056 --> 00:14:16.799]  That's like saying of two mammals.
[00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:20.027]  I think?
[00:14:41.624 --> 00:14:46.545]  If he does these steel and aluminum deals, we don't really have any steel or aluminum production compared to what we did.
[00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:50.026]  It's down by over 80% since the 1950s.
[00:14:50.046 --> 00:14:58.809]  And what we have is leaving because they have internal tariffs against us with their taxes and regulations in China and other areas where no one can compete.
[00:14:59.909 --> 00:15:02.890]  And the industry's come here and said, we can hire people and we can do this.
[00:15:03.732 --> 00:15:08.093]  Because again, China lowered their tax from 15% to zero to counter Trump.
[00:15:08.653 --> 00:15:11.514]  So he said, okay, I'm gonna put tariffs on at 20%.
[00:15:12.254 --> 00:15:13.175]  What does that basically do?
[00:15:13.375 --> 00:15:18.316]  It matches what the Chinese have done, and then gives them a five-point ding.
[00:15:18.636 --> 00:15:20.217]  He's being very fair.
[00:15:21.737 --> 00:15:27.919]  And they're calling it, on CNN, a depression, oh and Germany's so mad, on and on and on.
[00:15:27.979 --> 00:15:31.600]  I mean, they've got so many tariffs and controls on our goods going into Europe.
[00:15:32.873 --> 00:15:33.533]  It's insane.
[00:15:34.654 --> 00:15:36.274]  So Trump's doing a lot of good.
[00:15:36.934 --> 00:15:43.856]  And I think that he's just putting out this rhetoric so they give us a deal that's really horrible so nothing happens and then he has the cake and eat it too.
[00:15:43.896 --> 00:15:44.516]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:15:44.997 --> 00:15:48.818]  You can't intellectually play that game.
[00:15:48.878 --> 00:15:53.979]  You can't do that with bedrock issues or we lose the intellectual battle down the road.
[00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:54.599]  We'll be back.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.020]  We've got critical news straight ahead.

[00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.232]  Olive leaf and so much more.
[00:16:35.772 --> 00:16:36.893]  It is concentrated.

[00:16:50.485 --> 00:16:51.746]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.926 --> 00:16:53.728]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:54.288 --> 00:16:54.889]  Immune Wall.

[00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.932]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.969 --> 00:20:27.150]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:32.871]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:35.412 --> 00:20:36.332]  I almost forgot.
[00:20:37.232 --> 00:20:37.952]  It's March 2nd, 2018.
[00:20:37.992 --> 00:20:39.152]  Texas Independence Day.
[00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:47.090]  There's a celebration of the adoption of the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2nd, 1836.
[00:20:48.411 --> 00:20:57.018]  With this document signed by 59 delegates, settlers in Mexican Texas officially declared independence from Mexico and created the Republic of Texas.
[00:20:59.961 --> 00:21:01.562]  And some of my ancestors are on that baby.
[00:21:02.563 --> 00:21:08.548]  So, we see the continued march on from people wanting to live under freedom,
[00:21:09.773 --> 00:21:12.215]  And you can look at Texas and say, well, is it true freedom?
[00:21:12.255 --> 00:21:13.436]  Well, compare it to Mexico.
[00:21:14.436 --> 00:21:22.182]  With the wealth and the freedom and the prosperity and the science and the technology, you can see that there was a lot more freedom here.
[00:21:22.982 --> 00:21:28.506]  And a lot bigger step away from colonialism and to independence.
[00:21:32.366 --> 00:21:40.069]  But the left teaches that Texas and all these other areas belong to Mexico when there's a reason there's been six flags over Texas.
[00:21:40.609 --> 00:21:53.553]  That's because it was a war zone that no one could keep until the Scottish and Irish, mainly, settlers and then German and English came in.
[00:21:55.794 --> 00:21:58.215]  They were the ones out of Alabama, Tennessee,
[00:22:00.051 --> 00:22:09.659]  Georgia, Virginia that came in at the behest of the Mexican government to fight a Comanche.
[00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:21.610]  There was no Mexican government past areas of South Texas and Galveston and out into West Texas and places like San Antonio and South Texas.
[00:22:23.732 --> 00:22:26.074]  There were Spanish missions that were armed forts
[00:22:28.268 --> 00:22:28.928]  And that was it.
[00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:43.174]  And the only reason Anglo settlers were let in by the Anglo rulers of Mexico was to kill the Comanche.
[00:22:44.574 --> 00:22:45.255]  And that's a fact.
[00:22:45.755 --> 00:22:47.135]  And kill the Comanche we did.
[00:22:48.016 --> 00:22:49.376]  And also intermarry with them.
[00:22:49.997 --> 00:22:51.037]  As some of my ancestors did.
[00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:54.230]  But you never hear anybody say they're a Comanche.
[00:22:54.991 --> 00:22:58.013]  Because everybody that was a Comanche changed their name to another tribe.
[00:22:58.033 --> 00:23:02.476]  Because if you told somebody you were a Comanche, even until the 1920s, they'd try to kill you.
[00:23:04.377 --> 00:23:07.239]  Because a lot of folks, you know, had their mama and their daddy killed by them.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.300]  They remembered it.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.443]  And they've got these images of these sweet, loving people.
[00:23:13.224 --> 00:23:15.225]  And it was far, far different.
[00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:20.789]  The Comanche, you know, terrorized all the other Native Americans and had them all scared and took over basically much of the
[00:23:22.403 --> 00:23:22.543]  Yeah.
[00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.871]  Cut the islands off and bury it in an ant bed.
[00:23:38.911 --> 00:23:45.273]  And then the Apaches, which were a sweet lot compared to the Comanche, but were out in areas the Comanches didn't want.
[00:23:45.373 --> 00:23:48.895]  Desert, starting in West Texas, out into Arizona.
[00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:52.256]  They had a few of the Comanche tactics.
[00:23:52.697 --> 00:24:01.360]  And of course there was another loving group called the Karankawa, who were down on the Texas coast, as we know it today.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.961]  And they were cannibals.
[00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:05.002]  And they
[00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:13.517]  Quite a few Spanish letters went back about, you know, the people going on shore to get water and being eaten.
[00:24:14.857 --> 00:24:18.498]  So, let's just really be honest about what was going on around here.
[00:24:20.899 --> 00:24:21.459]  Let's be honest.
[00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:27.501]  There were people that ate their enemies, and that wasn't the only tribe that did that.
[00:24:29.241 --> 00:24:34.923]  And there were people that killed everybody but young women and children.
[00:24:36.963 --> 00:24:38.863]  And so that's why they were wiped out.
[00:24:40.164 --> 00:24:44.605]  And that's why groups affiliated with them got marched off to be killed.
[00:24:46.045 --> 00:24:47.445]  And I'm not saying that was a good thing.
[00:24:48.865 --> 00:24:56.727]  I'm saying people need to understand the reality of what went on in this country and how it was carved out and what was done.
[00:24:57.867 --> 00:25:00.048]  Like Mexico claims California.
[00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:02.368]  California, the Russians claimed for a while.
[00:25:03.028 --> 00:25:03.849]  So did the Spanish.
[00:25:04.109 --> 00:25:05.949]  So it goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:07.754 --> 00:25:08.394]  And that's a fact.
[00:25:09.835 --> 00:25:15.817]  They don't teach in colleges what you just heard.
[00:25:17.518 --> 00:25:21.920]  They teach evil white people came down here because they wanted to continue slavery.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.861]  Even though, again, less than 2% had slaves.
[00:25:26.822 --> 00:25:28.823]  And that Mexico is this wonderful free place.
[00:25:29.283 --> 00:25:32.524]  Oh, is that why Santa Ana lost Guatemala as well and other states of Mexico?
[00:25:32.845 --> 00:25:33.625]  No, he was a tyrant.
[00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:40.475]  Now, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes, and I'm going to get focused, but I want to do a little bit of Texas Independence Day here.
[00:25:41.536 --> 00:25:43.477]  Is Trump going sideways on us?
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.982]  I think the answer is rhetorically, yes.
[00:25:49.622 --> 00:26:04.014]  Even sitting there and acting like he's appeasing and giving validity to victim disarmament policies when the Democrats admit they want the abolition of the Second Amendment is a tactic so that they bring forward such a larcenous bill that the whole thing gets shelved.
[00:26:04.892 --> 00:26:05.793]  He knows they don't have the votes.
[00:26:06.293 --> 00:26:09.116]  It's a tactic, and it worked on DACA.
[00:26:10.557 --> 00:26:12.739]  He gave them something reasonable, which he would have actually let them done.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.142]  They said total AMSI, total open borders.
[00:26:16.583 --> 00:26:21.228]  But this isn't something where what he was saying, I think, was reasonable as what he said in the campaign.
[00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:29.435]  This is going back on what he said in the campaign, even if it's rhetorical and it has, again, dented his aura.
[00:26:30.493 --> 00:26:34.358]  Of being a person that delivers and a person that's a promise keeper.
[00:26:34.978 --> 00:26:36.360]  And it makes me sick.
[00:26:37.842 --> 00:26:40.945]  And it's made people even more angry because they love Trump.
[00:26:42.047 --> 00:26:44.730]  And so it's, you know, like a spurned woman.
[00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.934]  Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
[00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.092]  Is that a Bible verse or is that always forget or is that Shakespeare?
[00:26:53.753 --> 00:26:55.934]  Maybe Shakespeare quoted it, but it is a Bible verse.
[00:26:55.954 --> 00:26:56.275]  Can we look?
[00:26:56.915 --> 00:27:06.222]  And believe me, we all know if you've had a woman scorned, even if they leave you just to make you try to come groveling back to them and then you don't, man do they get mad!
[00:27:07.043 --> 00:27:09.985]  They'll cut their own nose off to spite their face just to get at you.
[00:27:10.466 --> 00:27:13.428]  Well, hell hath no fear like a woman scorned.
[00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:16.491]  And that is William Congrave.
[00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:17.772]  See, I can't even get it right.
[00:27:18.552 --> 00:27:19.373]  First written as
[00:27:22.455 --> 00:27:27.238]  Heaven has, hell hath no fury like a woman's score, but it was in Old English there in another way.
[00:27:27.619 --> 00:27:28.339]  But I'm digressing.
[00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:41.428]  Hell hath no fury, well, hell hath no fury like an electorate that has been betrayed over and over and over and over again, and where betrayal just becomes compromise.
[00:27:43.249 --> 00:27:48.233]  You can't compromise with people who are the essence of betrayal.
[00:27:49.957 --> 00:27:50.437]  You can't do it.
[00:27:50.457 --> 00:27:51.878]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:27:52.198 --> 00:27:53.779]  I just briefly want to thank the listeners.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:03.684]  During our fundraising drive of the last 24 hours, we're going to continue live transmission until 6 o'clock tonight.
[00:28:03.784 --> 00:28:05.345]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:28:07.866 --> 00:28:12.089]  I am taking my children on a short vacation next week.
[00:28:12.489 --> 00:28:15.951]  I'm sure the media will announce that I, because of all these false allegations, have quit.
[00:28:15.971 --> 00:28:16.811]  I've been hiding.
[00:28:19.232 --> 00:28:22.478]  We just say these things so we can then show you how we know the enemy when they do it.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.422]  I told you they were banning our YouTube.
[00:28:25.603 --> 00:28:26.745]  Then they denied it.
[00:28:26.885 --> 00:28:27.786]  Then they said they were.
[00:28:28.087 --> 00:28:29.589]  Then they admitted it was for political reasons.
[00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.811]  And then they reinstated it.
[00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:41.266]  They totally banned Dr. Corsi's YouTube channel, our DC Bureau man, and then returned it today.
[00:28:41.947 --> 00:28:49.153]  And that's a whole civil war inside YouTube that's amazing, where YouTube admits rogue employees are doing this.
[00:28:49.213 --> 00:28:52.355]  Well, CNN says they're contacting people at YouTube and saying, go do it.
[00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:54.097]  And I told you it's all fraud.
[00:28:54.897 --> 00:29:00.502]  And they had all these TV shows celebrated, and it's now blown up in all of your dirty, lying faces.
[00:29:08.874 --> 00:29:14.178]  My good friend, I've gotten to know him really well over the years, knew his dad before I even knew him, Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[00:29:14.198 --> 00:29:17.140]  He's got a new film we'll talk about in the next segment, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:27.787]  Hollywood free, made in Texas, funded in Texas, and then of course the big films you've produced for Hollywood, but also for cable television, Lifetime, Hallmark, you name it.
[00:29:28.368 --> 00:29:32.951]  Very successful, but now you've got The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde sitting back, the state of the world,
[00:29:33.591 --> 00:29:39.916]  I mean, I don't think we've turned the tide yet, but man, there was really nobody fighting back except a few folks before.
[00:29:40.256 --> 00:29:41.677]  The world has really changed.
[00:29:41.957 --> 00:29:45.660]  What period in time do you think we're in right now, Mike Norris?
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.641]  We're in the greatest time ever.
[00:29:47.661 --> 00:29:50.203]  I mean, we're making America great again.
[00:29:50.223 --> 00:29:54.906]  We've got great people around just speaking the truth everywhere.
[00:29:55.307 --> 00:29:57.028]  And I think the elites are going down.
[00:29:57.568 --> 00:30:00.370]  And I think this is such an exciting time.
[00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.491]  I'm happy to be alive.
[00:30:01.531 --> 00:30:02.652]  I'm proud to witness it.
[00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:05.140]  Making America great again.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:09.243]  You've made films about the globalists, the New World Order, you've been speaking about it for decades, fighting it.
[00:30:10.784 --> 00:30:13.886]  This is super positive, but they are striking back.
[00:30:14.206 --> 00:30:15.086]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:15.126 --> 00:30:22.211]  And the thing with this film, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, after we did Amerigeddon, that was such a large film, it took a long time, big budget.
[00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:32.338]  What I wanted to do was kind of strip everything down and really get into a story about what would the world look like if civil war actually took place,
[00:30:33.118 --> 00:30:39.024]  Everybody factioned up, and a spiritual warfare broke out within our country.
[00:30:39.444 --> 00:30:40.185]  That's already happened!
[00:30:40.865 --> 00:30:41.626]  It's starting!
[00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:49.593]  But you know, a lot of it had to do with the way you were talking years ago about the demonic entities of not only Hollywood, but the government, everything.
[00:30:50.254 --> 00:30:52.356]  Hey, if there's a God, there's a devil.
[00:30:52.956 --> 00:31:01.719]  And the devil is after believers all over the country and we've got to be prepared and we've got to be ready to fight for our faith, for our country, for everything.
[00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:04.079]  But that's the thing with Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:08.260]  It deals with the spiritual battle that can take place within us.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.361]  And we've got all the public statements by Antifa about
[00:31:10.421 --> 00:31:13.745]  Rising up, taking over, triggering something for martial law.
[00:31:14.525 --> 00:31:16.047]  This is really what they're pushing.
[00:31:16.087 --> 00:31:19.390]  So a very, very timely, timely film.
[00:31:20.151 --> 00:31:25.537]  When you see them failing though on every front, when you see Soros starting to fail, what do you think they're going to do next?
[00:31:25.557 --> 00:31:26.218]  They're not going to give up.
[00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:28.921]  You know, Alex, I wish I knew.
[00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:31.223]  I really wish I knew what they were going to do.
[00:31:31.243 --> 00:31:32.044]  They're not going to give up.
[00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:45.455]  Um, I'm a little nervous to see, you know, what the millennials, so to say, um, you know, I think they're so brainwashed that they will follow anything without any thought to it.
[00:31:45.796 --> 00:31:51.180]  So, a little curious to see what happens with them, but you know what?
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.662]  We're going to kick their butts everywhere.
[00:31:53.762 --> 00:31:55.384]  We're going to beat them, Alex.
[00:31:55.664 --> 00:31:57.726]  We are going to win this battle.
[00:32:02.245 --> 00:32:06.127]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:06.667 --> 00:32:14.091]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:32:14.791 --> 00:32:19.493]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:32:20.093 --> 00:32:21.994]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:32:22.635 --> 00:32:26.056]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:32:26.857 --> 00:32:29.318]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:32:29.998 --> 00:32:36.644]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:32:37.264 --> 00:32:44.510]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:32:45.371 --> 00:32:52.016]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:32:52.597 --> 00:32:53.678]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:55.860]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[00:33:05.874 --> 00:33:08.498]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.163 --> 00:33:30.287]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[00:33:30.587 --> 00:33:32.349]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:32.589 --> 00:33:34.551]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:33:36.592 --> 00:33:37.033]  That's right.
[00:33:37.913 --> 00:33:41.136]  Look at some of the unbelievable stories at Infowars.com.
[00:33:41.916 --> 00:33:51.324]  As we've pointed out, they're not just fining people in Germany, France, and Sweden thousands of euros if they even say that Islam
[00:33:52.915 --> 00:33:56.476]  He's not a religion of peace and that it's associated with violence and oppression of women.
[00:33:57.897 --> 00:34:13.382]  But Marie Le Pen has been criminally charged yet again and is facing two years in prison for saying that ISIS is as big a threat to Europe and that the Islamic ISIS invasion as Hitler was, which is totally true.
[00:34:15.863 --> 00:34:18.244]  In fact, Hitler wanted to Islamify Europe.
[00:34:18.664 --> 00:34:20.404]  I've read his writings where he said that.
[00:34:20.444 --> 00:34:22.445]  I mean, talk about a crazy man.
[00:34:24.497 --> 00:34:26.537]  Because he wanted to totally take over the Middle East, the whole world.
[00:34:26.577 --> 00:34:32.419]  He had it all figured out and now they've done the same EU model and the globalists have got it all figured out how they're going to take over our lives.
[00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:38.200]  So, of course, we see these articles every day now like it's no big deal.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:38.840]  Sweden.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.441]  Woman interrogated and imprisoned for posting a joke meme about Islam.
[00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:49.122]  And we'll show you the joke meme if we can scroll down for TV viewers.
[00:34:50.683 --> 00:34:52.607]  For radio listeners, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:34:52.707 --> 00:35:00.123]  Thought criminal faces two years in jail after authorities grilled her on support for multiculturalism.
[00:35:01.024 --> 00:35:03.245]  A woman in Sweden has been interrogated by the police and her DNA taken.
[00:35:03.585 --> 00:35:08.446]  Subsequently imprisoned for the crime of sharing a joke meme about Islam on Facebook.
[00:35:08.886 --> 00:35:10.467]  And Facebook reports to the police.
[00:35:10.587 --> 00:35:12.067]  They use the former Stasi in Germany.
[00:35:12.747 --> 00:35:24.910]  The 32-year-old woman from Gothenburg drew the attention of authorities after she posted the image below, which depicts a Muslim man having his brain removed and then being wrapped in Islamic headdress.
[00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:29.852]  While the meme may be considered offensive,
[00:35:30.751 --> 00:35:32.891]  What happened next was truly Orwellian.
[00:35:32.911 --> 00:35:39.453]  A reporter alerted police to the post claiming that the woman had expressed herself in a threatening manner towards a protected group.
[00:35:40.713 --> 00:35:46.574]  The reporter passed on details of the woman's identity and her place of residence.
[00:35:48.334 --> 00:35:56.816]  And basically, the meme is, you put, you take a brain out, you put poop in the brain, you put a
[00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:05.078]  Turban on it, you know, he's had brain surgery, and then you're out physically attacking people in the street, you're an islamicist.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.265]  A woman profusely apologized for the post, claiming she thought it was aimed at members of ISIS.
[00:36:12.346 --> 00:36:14.227]  While asserting that her best friend was Muslim.
[00:36:14.247 --> 00:36:15.367]  Oh, of course, grovel properly.
[00:36:15.827 --> 00:36:18.228]  And that she was ill at the time with a fever.
[00:36:18.868 --> 00:36:20.789]  Which she posted the image.
[00:36:20.869 --> 00:36:23.170]  Oh, I love how they grovel instead of saying it's her free speech.
[00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.971]  You, you, you globalist thugs.
[00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:30.733]  This did not satisfy authorities who proceeded to interrogate her about her thoughts on Sweden's multicultural society.
[00:36:30.753 --> 00:36:35.655]  And by the way, they run the Sweden culture minister as a Muslim that says it's his job to get rid of it.
[00:36:36.544 --> 00:36:37.405]  The threat of Swedish culture.
[00:36:37.865 --> 00:36:39.606]  And whether she had something against Muslims.
[00:36:40.126 --> 00:36:41.187]  Well, they had something against her.
[00:36:41.507 --> 00:36:45.290]  The woman insisted she was against the Islamic State and non-individual Muslims.
[00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.551]  Well, you can't do that.
[00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:56.078]  However, Gothenburg prosecutor, Sarah Torskog, if I'm pronouncing that right, decided to proceed with charges of hate speech.
[00:36:56.418 --> 00:36:58.259]  And the woman now faces two years in prison.
[00:36:58.279 --> 00:36:59.640]  This is what they're trying to get here.
[00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:06.843]  Comedy Central and everybody go, Jones has had his YouTube struck and it's about to go down for hate speech!
[00:37:07.003 --> 00:37:08.624]  No, they said bullying is what they said.
[00:37:08.985 --> 00:37:11.367]  And by the way, they had to restore it because that was even a fraud.
[00:37:11.387 --> 00:37:15.029]  A, you shouldn't take somebody's speech for what you call bullying.
[00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.172]  That should be done in the courts, if you can prove it.
[00:37:18.492 --> 00:37:20.394]  Oh, think of that, actually proving something.
[00:37:21.275 --> 00:37:22.876]  And then you have to expand on it from there.
[00:37:24.417 --> 00:37:27.279]  But now, oh, they had a big Gizmodo article about
[00:37:28.928 --> 00:37:32.989]  Infowars, Washington, YouTube taken down with tens of millions of views.
[00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:34.209]  Very popular channel.
[00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.591]  And everybody celebrated it and people are all over the news.
[00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:40.971]  I mean, I've got stacks of them going, yay!
[00:37:41.031 --> 00:37:41.351]  Yay!
[00:37:41.391 --> 00:37:42.152]  They're on our website.
[00:37:42.432 --> 00:37:43.792]  In the comment section, yay!
[00:37:44.032 --> 00:37:46.193]  We took down one of their YouTubes!
[00:37:46.233 --> 00:37:46.633]  Yay!
[00:37:46.693 --> 00:37:47.273]  We did it!
[00:37:47.733 --> 00:37:48.613]  We hate free speech!
[00:37:50.394 --> 00:37:53.215]  This morning, all the strikes are gone and it's back.
[00:37:54.375 --> 00:37:57.816]  Because YouTube came out and told Bloomberg, we've had
[00:37:58.815 --> 00:38:02.398]  Some rogue employees targeting conservatives, and we apologize.
[00:38:03.819 --> 00:38:05.220]  And you know why they're apologizing?
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:11.284]  Because we have their executives on video saying they're blocking us because of our views, not for bullying.
[00:38:13.246 --> 00:38:18.169]  But never fear, they've got the Young Turks coming out, calling it my anti-Semitic meltdown.
[00:38:18.189 --> 00:38:20.651]  We'll play some of it, and it is incredible.
[00:38:21.652 --> 00:38:25.755]  They say I'm an anti-Semite for saying George Soros
[00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:29.181]  Worked with the Nazis.
[00:38:32.702 --> 00:38:35.983]  You talk about jumping the shark, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:36.504 --> 00:38:46.867]  Soros' father wrote a book, Soros wrote a book, and Soros was on 60 Minutes saying he helped round up Jews and felt no remorse.
[00:38:46.927 --> 00:38:54.649]  And we're gonna play the clip, next segment, and then I'm gonna play Sink Uyghur, who named his group after the young Turks
[00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:58.772]  Who killed over a million and a half Armenians.
[00:39:00.333 --> 00:39:00.733]  Christians.
[00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:09.538]  And he says it doesn't exist, when it's totally recognized, the Associated Press wrote about it at the time, and it's completely documented.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:19.003]  But instead, the Los Angeles Armenian community loves him, and donates to him on record, and likes it.
[00:39:21.304 --> 00:39:25.827]  Talk about Stockholm Syndrome, you talk about being cucks, shame on you!
[00:39:28.479 --> 00:39:30.662]  If you won't stand up for your own people, I will.
[00:39:31.723 --> 00:39:34.386]  Because if somebody doesn't stand up for you, nobody will stand up for me.
[00:39:35.208 --> 00:39:36.669]  And this whole electronic lynching.
[00:39:40.995 --> 00:39:41.375]  That's right.
[00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:43.278]  Continuing.
[00:39:44.778 --> 00:39:49.764]  As we've exhaustively documented, Sweden is an authoritarian country that prosecutes people for satire and telling the truth.
[00:39:50.364 --> 00:39:53.508]  It goes through 70-year-old people being put in jail on all the videos of it.
[00:39:53.548 --> 00:40:04.840]  I mean, they have these diversity concerts, and then the women show up, and then the men line up 30, 40 deep and rape them bloody, and the police do nothing.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.182]  It's a religion!
[00:40:08.996 --> 00:40:10.096]  of sacrificing Europe.
[00:40:10.616 --> 00:40:15.198]  That's what Satanism is, is sacrificing your culture, giving in, being a cuck.
[00:40:16.818 --> 00:40:17.558]  On one end of it.
[00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:32.262]  Yeah, hundreds protested in Sweden after police told women to stay inside or walk in pairs after a series of violent gang rapes of teenage girls, and the police chief came out and said it's Muslims doing it, and
[00:40:33.499 --> 00:40:52.335]  That police chief got fired, and then Tommy Robinson, who was just on today, earlier in the 24-hour broadcast, he's been banned off Twitter for saying the police statistic that 90 plus percent of pedophilia and raping girls, which is they meant grooming as well, is Muslims!
[00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:59.702]  So the Muslim radicals are really doing it, but then there's newspaper headlines everywhere saying
[00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:08.566]  That I hugged a woman once, which they thought was grooming, which wasn't even true, and that then becomes, in Newsweek, sex assault.
[00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:14.132]  Think about that.
[00:41:14.832 --> 00:41:17.695]  But then you put the headline up, hoping you just see the headline, see?
[00:41:19.016 --> 00:41:20.097]  Hoping you just believe it.
[00:41:20.197 --> 00:41:23.781]  There's another clip on Infowars where a professor comes over to a pro-gun table,
[00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:25.610]  of course.
[00:41:41.986 --> 00:41:46.968]  It says, and he was there with a Russian operative handling him.
[00:41:47.008 --> 00:41:48.388]  Just, oh, oh, it's total proof!
[00:41:48.848 --> 00:41:49.109]  See?
[00:41:49.129 --> 00:41:52.270]  It's like Hillary Clinton's lawyer.
[00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.531]  Her personal lawyer is the one that filed this on us.
[00:41:55.931 --> 00:41:59.872]  And you can just read it, and it's like, oh, throw a little bit of Russian in there.
[00:42:00.092 --> 00:42:01.133]  You're like, that's ridiculous.
[00:42:01.193 --> 00:42:02.413]  No, not to Democrat followers.
[00:42:02.693 --> 00:42:04.974]  They'll hear that and say, see?
[00:42:04.994 --> 00:42:05.054]  See?
[00:42:05.634 --> 00:42:07.555]  He's got Russians telling him what to do in the office.
[00:42:09.775 --> 00:42:11.196]  I want to thank you all for the support.
[00:42:11.236 --> 00:42:13.357]  We've got some of the biggest sales in our history.
[00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:16.339]  We've never gone 80%, but those are some clearance items.
[00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:22.643]  There's some great t-shirts that for some reason, such an extensive area, kind of gets hidden on the shopping cart wherever.
[00:42:23.624 --> 00:42:24.644]  They're 80% off.
[00:42:24.864 --> 00:42:26.846]  That is below cost.
[00:42:27.906 --> 00:42:28.287]  We've got
[00:42:29.403 --> 00:42:31.124]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:42:31.164 --> 00:42:33.286]  We'll be back with the really big news.
[00:43:02.866 --> 00:43:04.667]  Joe Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[00:43:04.727 --> 00:43:09.270]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:10.051 --> 00:43:11.752]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[00:43:11.792 --> 00:43:14.214]  Directed by the amazing director, Joe Gilbert.
[00:43:14.254 --> 00:43:15.115]  Here is the trailer.
[00:43:15.555 --> 00:43:19.798]  Call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[00:43:20.659 --> 00:43:23.461]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:25.522]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[00:43:25.562 --> 00:43:26.083]  Who cares?
[00:43:29.793 --> 00:43:30.693]  You haven't been called.
[00:43:32.594 --> 00:43:33.615]  Go back to Univision.
[00:43:33.835 --> 00:43:35.855]  I think Jeb is a nice person.
[00:43:35.915 --> 00:43:36.436]  He's very low energy.
[00:43:36.456 --> 00:43:38.016]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[00:43:38.036 --> 00:43:38.816]  Throw him out.
[00:43:38.836 --> 00:43:43.038]  Throw him out into the cold.
[00:43:43.258 --> 00:43:44.719]  Don't give him their coat.
[00:43:46.059 --> 00:43:46.499]  No coats.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.221]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:52.622]  Lying dead.
[00:43:57.009 --> 00:44:01.393]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[00:44:01.413 --> 00:44:05.156]  The most dishonest human beings.
[00:44:05.176 --> 00:44:10.841]  These people right here.
[00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:12.042]  Look at all the cameras.
[00:44:12.062 --> 00:44:12.622]  So disgusting.
[00:44:12.642 --> 00:44:14.223]  This socialist slash communist.
[00:44:14.243 --> 00:44:14.784]  Crazy Bernie.
[00:44:14.804 --> 00:44:15.985]  He's crazy as a mid-button.
[00:44:18.267 --> 00:44:19.027]  Pocahontas?
[00:44:19.047 --> 00:44:19.928]  The Indian?
[00:44:20.108 --> 00:44:21.089]  Very offensive.
[00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.910]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.091]  A Pocahontas?
[00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:26.075]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:44:26.155 --> 00:44:27.136]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[00:44:27.356 --> 00:44:29.438]  She's been crooked from the beginning.
[00:44:34.823 --> 00:44:35.404]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:44:35.444 --> 00:44:37.726]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[00:44:37.906 --> 00:44:38.847]  Yeah.
[00:44:38.907 --> 00:44:42.530]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[00:44:42.971 --> 00:44:44.492]  This had nothing to do with me.
[00:44:44.572 --> 00:44:46.054]  Except I might have pointed it out.
[00:44:47.904 --> 00:44:50.067]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[00:44:50.207 --> 00:44:52.029]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[00:44:52.049 --> 00:44:53.411]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[00:44:54.072 --> 00:44:55.614]  Because they were protecting him.
[00:44:55.754 --> 00:44:56.655]  I'm trying to be nice.
[00:44:56.695 --> 00:44:58.197]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[00:44:59.519 --> 00:45:01.081]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:03.123]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[00:45:03.163 --> 00:45:04.305]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[00:45:06.075 --> 00:45:08.496]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[00:45:08.936 --> 00:45:09.517]  It just doesn't work.
[00:45:09.537 --> 00:45:11.538]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[00:45:11.658 --> 00:45:14.499]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:17.321]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[00:45:18.481 --> 00:45:20.282]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[00:45:20.582 --> 00:45:23.864]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[00:45:24.144 --> 00:45:25.084]  Repeat after me.
[00:45:25.104 --> 00:45:27.926]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[00:45:27.966 --> 00:45:29.366]  That's not going to happen.
[00:45:29.867 --> 00:45:30.687]  So help me God.
[00:45:31.007 --> 00:45:32.348]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:41.479]  We will make America great again!
[00:45:42.702 --> 00:45:43.745]  Go home to mommy.
[00:45:44.106 --> 00:45:45.329]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:47.153]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[00:45:48.519 --> 00:45:49.760]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.541]  We carry them all.
[00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:51.442]  We sell them all.
[00:45:51.462 --> 00:45:52.202]  They're all groundbreaking.
[00:45:52.222 --> 00:45:54.004]  But this one, this one is fun.
[00:45:54.665 --> 00:45:55.926]  And very, very celebratory.
[00:45:55.966 --> 00:45:58.488]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[00:45:58.508 --> 00:45:59.369]  It's really a special film.
[00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:00.930]  Thanks a lot.
[00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:05.755]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[00:46:06.555 --> 00:46:09.238]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[00:46:09.878 --> 00:46:12.581]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:25.645]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[00:46:25.945 --> 00:46:29.107]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[00:46:29.147 --> 00:46:30.127]  That's why it stuck.
[00:46:30.347 --> 00:46:35.349]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[00:46:35.509 --> 00:46:36.449]  I thought I knew Trump.
[00:46:36.529 --> 00:46:37.369]  I studied Trump.
[00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:38.510]  I thought I knew him.
[00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.831]  Only when you see this all back to back, how he reacts.
[00:46:42.431 --> 00:46:43.592]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.887 --> 00:47:24.228]  The world is a dangerous place.
[00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:34.896]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:47:35.876 --> 00:47:39.779]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:40.219 --> 00:47:44.062]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:47:44.422 --> 00:47:46.004]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:47.905 --> 00:47:49.926]  So, we've got a blueprint to bring the country back.
[00:47:49.946 --> 00:47:53.429]  The globalists know it, and they're attacking us on every front, savagely.
[00:47:53.909 --> 00:47:54.910]  It isn't about us, though.
[00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:57.832]  It's about you and platforms where you still have free speech.
[00:47:57.972 --> 00:47:59.493]  And they want to exhaust us.
[00:47:59.513 --> 00:48:00.394]  They want to wear us out.
[00:48:00.434 --> 00:48:02.155]  But you're sick of hearing about censorship.
[00:48:03.035 --> 00:48:10.941]  They banned thousands of conservative, and libertarian, and Christian, and veterans, and gun sites on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube the last two weeks.
[00:48:12.322 --> 00:48:15.164]  But now, thousands of them have come back.
[00:48:17.253 --> 00:48:24.940]  And YouTube says, we're sorry, rogue employees did this, and you didn't do what we said you did.
[00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:39.514]  Now, you're not going to hear apologies from Stephen Colbert, or Jordan Klepper, or any of these comedians that read off teleprompters who pose as newsmen, and their job is to murder truth.
[00:48:40.558 --> 00:48:43.000]  You're not going to hear apologies from CNN, who's running the campaign.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.581]  You're not going to hear apologies from SMBC.
[00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:48.963]  You're not going to hear apologies to you, the viewer and listener, that they lied to.
[00:48:49.324 --> 00:48:52.426]  They knew those videos said there were not crisis actors.
[00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:53.446]  This was a real shooting.
[00:48:53.826 --> 00:48:55.487]  They banned a video that started like that.
[00:48:57.148 --> 00:49:07.555]  While the young man, Mr. Hogg, is on TV and on Twitter calling me a piece of you-know-what and calling me all these names, and I'm saying, young man, please come on.
[00:49:07.595 --> 00:49:08.716]  I'd like to politely debate you.
[00:49:09.639 --> 00:49:12.824]  Think I'm not going to talk to the likes of you that says nobody died?
[00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.814]  Using him to ban the free speech but because you stood up!
[00:49:23.763 --> 00:49:33.750]  Because you stood up to him, because you got upset, because Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com, DrudgeReport.com, because he did that, and made it, because Drudge cared!
[00:49:35.131 --> 00:49:42.516]  All the rest of even the conservative and libertarian media thought, oh well, we'll have competition out of the way of Alex Falls, no, I'd be a domino, you'd be next.
[00:49:44.157 --> 00:49:50.762]  But Drudge, day after day, he linked yesterday to how they banned Corsi, and they put him back up today and apologized.
[00:49:51.642 --> 00:49:52.163]  See, Drudge,
[00:49:54.614 --> 00:49:57.476]  Has rational self-preservation traits.
[00:49:58.476 --> 00:49:59.577]  He's not a moron.
[00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:03.219]  But even the conservative side's cheered.
[00:50:03.259 --> 00:50:05.401]  Even the Washington Times kind of cheered.
[00:50:05.441 --> 00:50:06.602]  Like, yay!
[00:50:06.902 --> 00:50:07.462]  Yay!
[00:50:07.522 --> 00:50:08.523]  Let's start banning things!
[00:50:08.583 --> 00:50:10.744]  We'll get more attention, you morons!
[00:50:11.325 --> 00:50:13.346]  They're gonna shut you up next, you idiots!
[00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:19.273]  I mean, they really are idiots.
[00:50:19.954 --> 00:50:25.075]  Don't you know governments always pick some group first that they want to demonize to set the precedent?
[00:50:27.376 --> 00:50:28.856]  Then they end up arresting people.
[00:50:29.716 --> 00:50:32.177]  Are you really that historically illiterate?
[00:50:32.277 --> 00:50:33.997]  What is your problem?
[00:50:38.059 --> 00:50:42.720]  Well, yet again, Drudge pulls the bacon out of the fire.
[00:50:43.877 --> 00:50:45.279]  And you pulled the bacon out of the fire.
[00:50:45.519 --> 00:50:47.341]  By the way, Drudge pulled his own bacon out.
[00:50:47.621 --> 00:50:48.322]  I want to explain that.
[00:50:48.543 --> 00:50:50.325]  Not to say he didn't do something good, didn't have courage.
[00:50:50.585 --> 00:50:53.128]  In a world of cowards, just doing the right thing is heroic.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.381]  He's not satanic, you see.
[00:51:03.641 --> 00:51:07.524]  A satanic mindset doesn't even get its own preservation.
[00:51:07.584 --> 00:51:13.029]  It wants one level, one dimensional, mmm, somebody's going down, mmm, that makes me bigger.
[00:51:13.169 --> 00:51:15.791]  No, that makes you smaller, ding ding.
[00:51:18.093 --> 00:51:20.294]  I want to get to the Young Turks' bizarre deception.
[00:51:20.334 --> 00:51:21.876]  I can't play the whole thing, it's like eight minutes long.
[00:51:23.557 --> 00:51:29.702]  These are the people that are funded by Qatar and other Gulf state dictatorships and name themselves after the
[00:51:31.317 --> 00:51:37.142]  Brown shirt, paramilitary, that Hitler modeled the SA off of.
[00:51:37.382 --> 00:51:40.525]  He modeled it off Benito Mussolini and the Young Turks.
[00:51:40.805 --> 00:51:42.206]  Hitler wrote this, you can look it up.
[00:51:43.627 --> 00:51:51.354]  The SA, the thugs in the streets, the paramilitary before Hitler took power, the gangs, were modeled after the Young Turks.
[00:51:52.335 --> 00:51:54.518]  And he's a Turk, with the name Young Turk.
[00:51:55.099 --> 00:51:56.722]  And Islamists is funding.
[00:51:57.543 --> 00:52:01.930]  And then he gets up there, and he says, George Soros
[00:52:03.303 --> 00:52:06.787]  I'm anti-semitic because I said George Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[00:52:07.668 --> 00:52:11.292]  George Soros said he's proud that he survived by doing that.
[00:52:11.352 --> 00:52:18.680]  So let me see, if a foreign country occupied and then I helped round up my own family so I'd live, I'd be called a collaborator.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.582]  I'd be called the lowest form of scum.
[00:52:20.902 --> 00:52:23.345]  Worse than the people that came in and took over, because they're bad.
[00:52:23.565 --> 00:52:25.107]  They're usurpers, but you're a traitor.
[00:52:27.256 --> 00:52:36.738]  And by some bizarre alchemy, they've got PR out there, CNN, ABC News, they always go, Alex Jones lies and says George Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[00:52:36.758 --> 00:52:45.320]  I don't know, his dad wrote a book, he wrote a book, he went on 60 Minutes trying to hide it in plain view back in, what, 1999, when he thought everybody was so dumb they'd just buy into it.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:52.621]  And that was his job, it was 14, 15, 16, was rounding Jews up in Hungary.
[00:52:55.819 --> 00:53:06.543]  And then, he's got the nerve to point his finger and then have a young Turk... A young Turk!
[00:53:06.563 --> 00:53:08.204]  It's all hiding in plain view!
[00:53:08.424 --> 00:53:09.944]  Don't you like how they rubbed our faces in it?
[00:53:11.325 --> 00:53:16.707]  A young Turk, an arrogant, dim-witted buffoon.
[00:53:20.428 --> 00:53:21.449]  Oh, but there's no...
[00:53:23.131 --> 00:53:24.972]  There's no connection to the Nazis with George Soros.
[00:53:25.492 --> 00:53:27.093]  And it's anti-semitic.
[00:53:27.553 --> 00:53:29.514]  I've attacked a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:31.655 --> 00:53:33.416]  Next we'll hear Hitler was a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:33.436 --> 00:53:35.637]  Did you know Hitler was a holocaust survivor according to this logic?
[00:53:35.657 --> 00:53:36.838]  I think that's terrible.
[00:53:37.138 --> 00:53:38.419]  I don't think he was a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:38.619 --> 00:53:40.600]  I don't think Heinrich Himmler was a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:41.481 --> 00:53:45.202]  I don't think Zeb Dietrich was a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:45.323 --> 00:53:48.124]  Or Klaus Barbie?
[00:53:48.624 --> 00:53:49.765]  Joseph Mingala perhaps?
[00:53:54.093 --> 00:54:01.618]  I know the Nazi survivor, Nazi wealth is the head of the unelected EU, Mr. Juncker.
[00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:04.720]  I'm running out of time here.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.082]  Let's go to this clip of Soros first.
[00:54:10.006 --> 00:54:14.170]  It's the claim that the August protest was some sort of left-wing plot.
[00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.111]  Who, you might ask, would say something so offensive?
[00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:19.014]  An elected representative who's serving right now in the U.S.
[00:54:19.054 --> 00:54:19.434]  Congress.
[00:54:19.874 --> 00:54:20.795]  And look at the background.
[00:54:20.815 --> 00:54:25.319]  George Soros is one of those people that actually helps, you know, back these individuals.
[00:54:25.659 --> 00:54:26.100]  Who is he?
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:34.787]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[00:54:34.807 --> 00:54:35.308]  Yes, yes.
[00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:40.144]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:54:40.244 --> 00:54:40.666]  That's right.
[00:54:50.026 --> 00:54:50.986]  Is this lost on anyone?
[00:54:51.006 --> 00:54:52.326]  George Soros is a famous Nazi collaborator.
[00:54:52.366 --> 00:54:55.207]  But, now let's hear from the young Turk, named after a genocidal organization.
[00:54:55.227 --> 00:54:55.807]  Can't make this up.
[00:54:55.827 --> 00:54:56.687]  Let's hear from him.
[00:55:16.701 --> 00:55:21.924]  Alex Jones has received considerable criticism for, first of all, everything, as he should.
[00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:27.646]  He's a lunatic, makes some wild conspiracy theories about pig-bear-human hybrids.
[00:55:28.747 --> 00:55:31.128]  And on top of that, he's deeply anti-Semitic.
[00:55:31.288 --> 00:55:32.669]  Now, why do I say that?
[00:55:32.889 --> 00:55:33.789]  For a number of reasons.
[00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:40.553]  He has attacked George Soros over and over again with references to his background.
[00:55:41.033 --> 00:55:43.494]  He attacked Michael Wolff, who wrote the book about Donald Trump.
[00:55:43.514 --> 00:55:44.495]  They both happen to be Jewish.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:47.601]  Back that up.
[00:55:48.602 --> 00:55:50.063]  Michael Wolff writes this book.
[00:55:50.223 --> 00:55:51.564]  Everybody criticizes him.
[00:55:52.285 --> 00:55:53.086]  He's Jewish.
[00:55:53.626 --> 00:56:00.733]  And so I'm attacking Jews because George Soros is a Jew who worked with the Nazis.
[00:56:01.273 --> 00:56:02.614]  So it's anti-Semitic to talk bad about him.
[00:56:03.015 --> 00:56:04.676]  This is a get out of jail free card, is what he's saying.
[00:56:05.016 --> 00:56:06.238]  Wolff writes this phony book.
[00:56:06.298 --> 00:56:07.158]  Everybody decries it.
[00:56:07.339 --> 00:56:08.640]  He's known in New York as a fraud.
[00:56:10.101 --> 00:56:12.683]  And then, well, I mean, just hear it from Sink himself.
[00:56:12.723 --> 00:56:12.984]  Here it is.
[00:56:13.797 --> 00:56:14.217]  Over and over
[00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:33.532]  I don't know if you know the source survived the Holocaust.
[00:56:34.052 --> 00:56:35.733]  Alex Jones is the worst guy on earth.
[00:56:35.753 --> 00:56:37.974]  Anyway, we're going to get to what happened today in a second.
[00:56:38.635 --> 00:56:48.920]  But in his midst of his lunatic attacks against Americans of Jewish descent, he started with Michael Wolff just a little while back, just to give you some context.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.241]  And he said, oh, Michael Wolff, he looks bad.
[00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:57.224]  And then he put up a picture of Brian Stelter and started railing on him and saying that he looks like Michael Wolff and they're all the same.
[00:56:57.904 --> 00:57:00.486]  Yeah, as it turns out, Brian Stelter is not even Jewish.
[00:57:00.626 --> 00:57:04.449]  I say they have psycho-looking smiles, and so do other people.
[00:57:04.469 --> 00:57:05.830]  Black people, white people, you name it.
[00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:08.051]  This is just so desperate, so weird.
[00:57:08.712 --> 00:57:10.233]  Anyways, I'm going to come back and put a little bit more of it.
[00:57:10.253 --> 00:57:13.155]  Then we've got Larry Pratt is really upset with Trump, and he's really concerned.
[00:57:13.175 --> 00:57:14.996]  I've never seen him this concerned in decades.
[00:57:15.016 --> 00:57:15.776]  We've been interviewing him.
[00:57:15.977 --> 00:57:17.298]  Gun Owners of America had coming on.
[00:57:18.078 --> 00:57:20.419]  Don't forget, I almost forgot, free shipping store-wide.
[00:57:20.479 --> 00:57:21.480]  It's going to end on Monday.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.721]  And we've got the biggest sales ever.
[00:57:23.741 --> 00:57:28.424]  So we buy a lot of product, great supplements, great books, great videos, great products.
[00:57:28.484 --> 00:57:32.306]  Infowarsstore.com, that's how you stand against George Soros and all these liars.
[00:57:32.446 --> 00:57:34.087]  What an incredible fraud.
[00:57:34.427 --> 00:57:35.608]  The worst person on earth.
[00:57:35.668 --> 00:57:39.230]  That's who I am, because I played a clip of George Soros saying he helped the Nazis.
[00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:40.911]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:40.951 --> 00:57:42.172]  That guy thinks you're stupid.
[00:57:42.472 --> 00:57:45.615]  And they want to shut us off the air so we can't show what liars.
[00:57:45.675 --> 00:57:46.196]  But guess what?
[00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:48.078]  You failed, scumbags!
[00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:49.299]  You failed again!

[00:58:06.295 --> 00:58:09.855]  Listen to all these incredible five star reviews from verified buyers.
[00:58:10.175 --> 00:58:13.296]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[00:58:13.536 --> 00:58:22.838]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin, and it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[00:58:23.018 --> 00:58:25.379]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:27.299]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[00:58:27.499 --> 00:58:30.140]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.921]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[00:58:35.241 --> 00:58:41.342]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[00:58:41.762 --> 00:58:46.263]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[00:58:46.283 --> 00:58:49.284]  It helps with focus too, like Brain Force Plus.
[00:58:49.824 --> 00:58:53.948]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products and they're always of supreme quality.
[00:58:54.369 --> 00:58:58.412]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking alpha power.
[00:58:58.673 --> 00:59:00.214]  There's definitely been a change.
[00:59:00.474 --> 00:59:01.115]  For the better.
[00:59:01.555 --> 00:59:05.319]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased and that's fine by me.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.401]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[00:59:07.822 --> 00:59:08.682]  I hope this lasts.
[00:59:09.543 --> 00:59:11.605]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[00:59:11.885 --> 00:59:18.011]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[00:59:18.312 --> 00:59:23.236]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[00:59:23.717 --> 00:59:27.040]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:32.646]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM, and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[00:59:33.206 --> 00:59:35.008]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[00:59:35.288 --> 00:59:35.808]  Not anymore.
[00:59:36.189 --> 00:59:37.389]  Seem to be sleeping better, too.
[00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.771]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[00:59:40.012 --> 00:59:41.393]  I will definitely buy this again.
[00:59:42.193 --> 00:59:45.536]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[00:59:46.217 --> 00:59:48.418]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:55.464 --> 01:00:01.369]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:17.837]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:33.328]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, on Texas Independence Day, it is the resistance to globalism.
[01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:35.550]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.993]  So, the young Turk, Cenk,
[01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:45.155]  The Gulf State Dictatorship funded, Al Gore funded creature.
[01:00:45.515 --> 01:00:52.800]  That's where the old prune caught line, caught with fake memos of course as well.
[01:00:54.061 --> 01:00:55.543]  The other fake newsman, Dan Rather.
[01:00:56.519 --> 01:01:01.542]  Now floats around over in that cesspit of the young, young turkeys.
[01:01:02.502 --> 01:01:04.903]  And I really shouldn't joke about this because it's so serious.
[01:01:05.464 --> 01:01:06.144]  I can't believe it.
[01:01:06.904 --> 01:01:10.626]  They've got all over the news saying George Soros never helped the Nazis.
[01:01:11.987 --> 01:01:15.709]  And that I'm lying, attacking a Holocaust survivor.
[01:01:15.769 --> 01:01:17.810]  This is so sick.
[01:01:19.025 --> 01:01:20.526]  But see, their followers will believe anything.
[01:01:20.966 --> 01:01:21.666]  So think of the logic.
[01:01:22.006 --> 01:01:30.470]  He helped for years round up Jews because he was a teenager and he could get in and find their hiding spots and get them to tell them where their money was and claim they were going to get them out.
[01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:37.834]  And then they'd take their money and give them over to the Nazis and then give the money to the Nazis and keep part of it.
[01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.395]  And they got super rich off that.
[01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:41.536]  And that's where George Soros came from.
[01:01:41.856 --> 01:01:46.338]  Man, you talk about having some baggage and being whacked out and being screwed up.
[01:01:48.928 --> 01:01:55.890]  And then you got a guy named after a genocidal organization who denies that the Young Turks ever killed any Christian Armenians.
[01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:56.930]  They killed a million and a half of them.
[01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.830]  That's now admitted.
[01:01:59.311 --> 01:02:01.491]  On there saying, I'm the worst person in the world.
[01:02:01.531 --> 01:02:02.531]  Well, guess what, Cenk?
[01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:04.092]  You can't shut me up, buddy.
[01:02:05.432 --> 01:02:12.834]  And I've got over 200 radio stations and all these TV stations, and we are kicking your political behind up and down the street, buddy.
[01:02:15.322 --> 01:02:21.148]  You know, George Soros might actually be one of the worst people in the world, but you say I'm one of the worst people in the world.
[01:02:23.691 --> 01:02:26.234]  Even though they've had hundreds of investigative reporters, hundreds!
[01:02:26.754 --> 01:02:37.686]  Usually you do this, it sounds like an exaggeration saying, I mean, it's probably thousands, crawling up and down, doing everything they can to try to find somebody to tell lies or to twist things.
[01:02:39.386 --> 01:02:46.377]  And I was just thinking about the latest stuff and it actually made me feel sorry for the individuals because they're being used, but I have to do what I have to do.
[01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:48.380]  And I just thought about
[01:02:50.973 --> 01:02:54.436]  Some of the sad issues that those folks have, and I actually feel sorry for them.
[01:02:55.437 --> 01:02:57.378]  But it makes me even more angry at the globalists.
[01:02:57.619 --> 01:02:58.159]  It's crazy.
[01:02:58.539 --> 01:03:03.243]  But this is the level of deception we're dealing with, so let's go back to the Young Turks leader.
[01:03:03.283 --> 01:03:03.643]  Here he is.
[01:03:04.244 --> 01:03:09.688]  And then he put up a picture of Brian Stelter and started railing on him and saying that he looks like Michael Wolff and they're all the same.
[01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:16.014]  Now, as it turns out, Brian Stelter is not Jewish, but of course Alex Jones... I never said Brian Stelter was Jewish!
[01:03:16.054 --> 01:03:19.737]  See how the deceptions are so fast, you have to listen every three seconds.
[01:03:21.206 --> 01:03:23.307]  He goes, oh, look, Michael Wolfe's Jewish.
[01:03:23.347 --> 01:03:24.548]  Look how he looks.
[01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:25.628]  I didn't say that.
[01:03:26.288 --> 01:03:28.449]  I said, these guys have these crazy smiles.
[01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:32.792]  Like Jack Nicholson, he's not Jewish.
[01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:35.093]  I mean, they got scary looking dudes, man.
[01:03:35.773 --> 01:03:36.513]  Ryan Stelter.
[01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:44.497]  I said, why would you put out these crazy, where he's like, that looks crazy.
[01:03:47.158 --> 01:03:50.380]  I've seen crazy people on the sidewalk, you know, that schizophrenics look like that.
[01:03:51.636 --> 01:03:52.577]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:03:52.598 --> 01:03:59.368]  Imagine you post your photo and it's like... I mean, he's just a weird looking dude.
[01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:03.214]  But again, oh, now I called him Jewish, but he's not.
[01:04:03.234 --> 01:04:04.415]  See, Alex is wrong again.
[01:04:04.756 --> 01:04:06.318]  You just lie to your audience.
[01:04:06.478 --> 01:04:07.019]  Every word.
[01:04:08.121 --> 01:04:09.542]  Let's go back to Mr. Turd.
[01:04:10.222 --> 01:04:11.043]  He gets worked up.
[01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:11.523]  He doesn't know.
[01:04:11.843 --> 01:04:12.624]  He's like, look at him!
[01:04:12.824 --> 01:04:14.385]  In fact, here, let's show you the video.
[01:04:14.425 --> 01:04:16.246]  Just look at Skelter again.
[01:04:16.266 --> 01:04:17.286]  Put him on screen.
[01:04:17.506 --> 01:04:20.648]  I think all the broadcast should be is just a photo of Skelter smiling.
[01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:27.272]  Oh, oh, oh my gosh.
[01:04:27.652 --> 01:04:29.293]  Oh, tell on her.
[01:04:29.353 --> 01:04:30.334]  Notice they do it on purpose.
[01:04:30.374 --> 01:04:31.534]  Media Matters blurs it.
[01:04:31.554 --> 01:04:32.775]  They all take it from Media Matters.
[01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.036]  That's George Soros.
[01:04:35.151 --> 01:04:36.232]  That's George Soros funded.
[01:04:36.412 --> 01:04:37.913]  The Young Turks have gotten George Soros money.
[01:04:37.933 --> 01:04:38.513]  It's been in the news.
[01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:40.995]  This is George Soros' TV station.
[01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.358]  Come on, come on up.
[01:04:46.019 --> 01:04:46.919]  Come on up.
[01:04:46.939 --> 01:04:50.982]  I think tomorrow I'm going to get a personal playing of this.
[01:04:51.963 --> 01:04:55.265]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[01:04:55.645 --> 01:04:58.067]  You are so aced, turd.
[01:04:58.407 --> 01:04:59.148]  You are so defeated.

[01:06:15.496 --> 01:06:18.859]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:19.139 --> 01:06:22.021]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:23.222]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:23.262 --> 01:06:25.084]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:25.124 --> 01:06:26.345]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:26.365 --> 01:06:32.449]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:06:46.834 --> 01:06:49.737]  The public will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:51.678 --> 01:07:00.226]  I am sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny of the mind of man.
[01:07:00.246 --> 01:07:01.187]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:01.287 --> 01:07:03.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:16.152 --> 01:07:27.041]  Well, I've been interviewing Larry Pratt for 20 years, at least 20 years, and I've never seen him as concerned as when he was on last night during the marathon broadcast that we're now into, what, hour 30 of?
[01:07:27.081 --> 01:07:31.384]  We'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., with a Sunday transmission.
[01:07:31.424 --> 01:07:35.948]  We're 10 hours a day live now with David Knight and his great transmission, the David Knight
[01:07:36.977 --> 01:07:38.057]  We're good to go.
[01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:06.623]  We'll look at amnesty for some dreamers, because he'd always said if they'd been here decades and weren't criminals, we could fast track that.
[01:08:06.663 --> 01:08:07.223]  That's reasonable.
[01:08:08.243 --> 01:08:10.124]  The Democrats came back and said we want total open borders.
[01:08:10.624 --> 01:08:13.625]  Total, you know, 20 deep chain migration, just unending.
[01:08:14.105 --> 01:08:15.045]  So the whole thing was killed.
[01:08:16.205 --> 01:08:19.266]  But see, he always said he would be reasonable, and that was reasonable.
[01:08:19.567 --> 01:08:20.767]  He didn't do that with this.
[01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:25.820]  He said, no we're not going to repeal any of this, it's the criminals.
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:31.762]  And now we've got all these clips, I don't think I need to play them again, but just so we have them, let's play a few and then go to Larry Pratt.
[01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:36.363]  Trump, I like taking the guns early, then do process.
[01:08:37.003 --> 01:08:39.264]  I mean, has he turned into Dianne Feinstein?
[01:08:39.464 --> 01:08:40.424]  Did he get a brain transplant?
[01:08:40.464 --> 01:08:40.744]  Here it is.
[01:08:41.621 --> 01:08:53.133]  I take the firearms first and then go to court because that's another system because a lot of times by the time you go to court it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures.
[01:08:54.054 --> 01:08:59.879]  I like taking the guns early like in this crazy man's case that just took place in Florida.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:01.781]  He had a lot of firearms.
[01:09:01.801 --> 01:09:02.562]  They saw everything.
[01:09:03.202 --> 01:09:04.603]  To go to court would have taken a long time.
[01:09:04.623 --> 01:09:09.007]  So you could do exactly what you're saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.
[01:09:09.748 --> 01:09:11.509]  That is the dream of the gun grabbers.
[01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:12.890]  That's actually Bloomberg's plan.
[01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:17.434]  They just say, oh, you see a psychologist, you can't have guns.
[01:09:17.494 --> 01:09:17.634]  No.
[01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:18.655]  There's already laws.
[01:09:18.695 --> 01:09:22.318]  You say, I'm going to kill people, and the police have been to your house, and you're on meds.
[01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:23.920]  You get adjudicated.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.744]  The guy at the Texas shooting at the church, he'd been in a mental institution, he escaped.
[01:09:29.384 --> 01:09:31.546]  He had a dishonorable discharge and he went and bought the guns.
[01:09:31.566 --> 01:09:32.447]  They didn't put the database.
[01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:37.652]  They need to court-martial the commanding officer over that and they'll start getting that in the database.
[01:09:37.952 --> 01:09:42.916]  I'm gonna go to Larry Pratt, that's why we got him on, but I can't even hardly play these clips, the other ones.
[01:09:42.936 --> 01:09:48.881]  Let's play the Feinstein Wicked Witch of the West garbage because it's just unbelievable.
[01:09:48.921 --> 01:09:49.182]  Here it is.
[01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:53.275]  If you could add that to this bill, that would be great, Diane.
[01:09:53.315 --> 01:09:58.983]  If you could add what you have also, and I think you can, into the bill... Joe, are you ready?
[01:09:59.003 --> 01:09:59.664]  Can you do that?
[01:10:00.345 --> 01:10:01.667]  Joe, can you do that, Pat?
[01:10:01.747 --> 01:10:02.408]  Can you add...
[01:10:06.273 --> 01:10:09.576]  Well, no, I'll help, but can you add what- Republicans look really upset.
[01:10:09.636 --> 01:10:10.437]  Can we add them in?
[01:10:10.657 --> 01:10:14.600]  And I know you can add what John- Yeah, I have another domestic violence- Cornyn's like, what the hell just happened?
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:19.204]  It's about dating partners, and a number of states have just enacted- I would say this.
[01:10:19.244 --> 01:10:20.905]  We're gonna get it passed.
[01:10:21.206 --> 01:10:21.866]  We're gonna get it passed.
[01:10:22.306 --> 01:10:29.312]  If you can add domestic violence paragraphs, pages, into this bill, I'm all for it.
[01:10:30.573 --> 01:10:32.075]  It's already there, Mr. President.
[01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:33.396]  So I know what he's doing.
[01:10:33.436 --> 01:10:35.517]  He's taking the you-know-what out of them, as they say in England.
[01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:43.764]  But you can't do it because it advances their flawed, fake system when they're admitting they want abolition of the Second Amendment is the goal, piece by piece.
[01:10:43.825 --> 01:10:46.026]  Larry Pratt, Gunners of America, thank you for joining us.
[01:10:46.046 --> 01:10:47.628]  I know you're a busy, busy man.
[01:10:48.128 --> 01:10:50.070]  What is the state of this situation right now?
[01:10:51.811 --> 01:10:53.993]  Let me just comment on one thing the President was saying.
[01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:54.794]  You've already
[01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:56.270]  I don't think so.
[01:11:16.246 --> 01:11:18.227]  They didn't do a thing.
[01:11:19.028 --> 01:11:35.878]  Why would we think that somehow being able to throw somebody in jail fixes something that was not a problem until their own sloppiness and lack of desire to interact with people that have been reported by who knows how many neighbors and people at school.
[01:11:36.718 --> 01:11:41.341]  This was a bad dude and apparently everybody knew it except the sheriff.
[01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:47.851]  So don't don't don't talk about... There was clearly a stand down and we need to be on offense.
[01:11:47.911 --> 01:11:53.633]  They had all the warnings, he was on the drugs, they stood down, all the defaults were not followed.
[01:11:53.653 --> 01:12:00.296]  We have the protections in place and as you said they're always trying to keep us from having select teachers armed which is the answer.
[01:12:01.456 --> 01:12:04.337]  That sure is the answer and isn't it interesting that
[01:12:05.152 --> 01:12:09.015]  Except for Congressman Massey and maybe a couple of senators.
[01:12:09.595 --> 01:12:12.617]  You just don't hear anybody talking about arming teachers.
[01:12:13.018 --> 01:12:18.822]  They're the ones that are going to be there during the first five, six minutes of a dirtbag's attack.
[01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:21.423]  That's when most of the people get killed.
[01:12:21.664 --> 01:12:24.886]  Sometimes that's all it lasts is five or six minutes.
[01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:28.150]  And we're not talking about arming teachers.
[01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:35.393]  Now, to the President's credit, he did say he would support that, but he's also supporting the shredding of the Second Amendment.
[01:12:35.413 --> 01:12:36.773]  What's the word on Capitol Hill?
[01:12:36.813 --> 01:12:37.994]  I know you've got feelers out.
[01:12:38.514 --> 01:12:41.675]  Is he just doing like DACA and being reasonable, and then they won't be reasonable?
[01:12:41.695 --> 01:12:42.815]  No, he's not really being reasonable.
[01:12:43.035 --> 01:12:44.496]  He's playing along with their false logic.
[01:12:45.116 --> 01:12:49.438]  What are your top... I know you've got some of the top lobbyists in the halls right now.
[01:12:49.558 --> 01:12:50.678]  What in Hades is going on?
[01:12:50.958 --> 01:12:52.479]  And what are the Republican lawmakers saying?
[01:12:53.632 --> 01:13:04.099]  Well we're still hoping that this is a feint, the way it was in DACA, and that he's ultimately going to spring the trap and the situation will be resolved.
[01:13:04.659 --> 01:13:09.502]  But it doesn't sound that way because he's used different language on this, he doesn't have
[01:13:09.983 --> 01:13:14.527]  He hasn't talked about how we might be able to walk it back.
[01:13:14.987 --> 01:13:18.850]  So we think this is a big, big deal.
[01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:28.138]  And we hope people will continue to, as many times a day as they can manage, contact the White House to tell them that this is the end of the Second Amendment.
[01:13:28.378 --> 01:13:34.263]  And it will also, if you carry this out, be the end of the Republican Party.
[01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:38.006]  They're going to get wiped out in 2018 elections.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:47.005]  If this is what they have brought to the table for the voters to judge them on, they will be judged and found wanting.
[01:13:47.486 --> 01:13:55.852]  This is an incredible betrayal, and the president seems to be rather more serious about this than he was with DACA.
[01:13:56.472 --> 01:13:59.975]  Again, I'm still leaving the door open, at least a crack.
[01:14:00.195 --> 01:14:05.119]  Hopefully the president is gaming this, but it increasingly doesn't sound that way.
[01:14:06.321 --> 01:14:10.225]  And even if he's trying to set a trap, it was a very reckless thing to say.
[01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:13.848]  Man, I just feel like, I'm not, I'm not putting on an actor.
[01:14:13.928 --> 01:14:15.549]  I just felt nauseous.
[01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:16.710]  I mean, I have been so committed.
[01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:17.711]  He's done so much good.
[01:14:18.291 --> 01:14:20.093]  It means, Larry, they must have compromised him.
[01:14:20.553 --> 01:14:24.376]  He's been fighting so hard, and they're just all around him, and he's been good.
[01:14:24.416 --> 01:14:28.820]  My gut knows he's good, and my gut thinks they're turning him.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.541]  I think what you think.
[01:14:29.561 --> 01:14:32.043]  My gut tells me, this is so sad, Larry.
[01:14:33.297 --> 01:14:38.201]  The way we've seen him, and I think I mentioned this last night, is that the president is not a conservative.
[01:14:38.221 --> 01:14:42.725]  We've never heard him refer to prominent conservative thinkers.
[01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:51.251]  He doesn't express himself as if he's looking at the economy as Ludwig von Mises might, a famous libertarian economist.
[01:14:52.472 --> 01:14:58.457]  The guy has been a fighter against the establishment, Republican and Democrat alike.
[01:14:58.957 --> 01:15:05.924]  And when he was doing that, most of the time we would be saying, right on, those are good things that you're opposing and fighting for.
[01:15:06.404 --> 01:15:17.134]  And he came across as a fighter, and hopefully he still is, but now we're talking about a major turn where he doesn't seem to have a rudder
[01:15:17.794 --> 01:15:20.075]  Because he doesn't seem to be a concern.
[01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:23.237]  Yeah, for the first time I read CNN headlines this morning and some of them were true.
[01:15:23.257 --> 01:15:24.957]  They're basically saying he's rudderless.
[01:15:25.097 --> 01:15:27.378]  And he's suddenly become rudderless.
[01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:29.780]  Let's come back in the last segment and ask why and what do we do.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.560]  But hey, here's the good news.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.721]  Larry Pratt's not gonna roll over.
[01:15:33.021 --> 01:15:34.062]  I don't care what they do to me.
[01:15:34.082 --> 01:15:35.663]  You see what they're doing to me, folks.
[01:15:35.683 --> 01:15:36.003]  It's 100% fake.
[01:15:36.303 --> 01:15:37.064]  I'm not rolling over.
[01:15:37.104 --> 01:15:38.365]  Ted Nugent's not rolling over.
[01:15:38.885 --> 01:15:39.966]  The veterans aren't rolling over.
[01:15:40.006 --> 01:15:41.187]  This audience isn't rolling over.
[01:15:41.507 --> 01:15:44.369]  And the Republican Party, the leadership, they're not rolling over.
[01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:46.891]  I've seen them say, listen, Mr. President, we're not doing this.
[01:15:47.131 --> 01:15:54.616]  We're not going to just go along with the last thing you heard from somebody, because you want to sit there with a bunch of grieving people that manipulated you, and so they pulled on your heartstrings.
[01:15:55.277 --> 01:15:55.997]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.037 --> 01:15:56.558]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.138 --> 01:15:58.299]  Are we seeing the end of Trump?
[01:15:58.799 --> 01:16:00.701]  Or will he wake up before he crashes the plane?

[01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:37.731]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:16:37.751 --> 01:16:40.793]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:16:41.634 --> 01:16:42.775]  It just gets old, man.
[01:16:43.055 --> 01:16:44.777]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:16:45.477 --> 01:16:47.559]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:16:47.799 --> 01:16:51.802]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:16:51.822 --> 01:16:54.304]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:16:55.105 --> 01:16:57.447]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:16:57.807 --> 01:16:58.928]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:16:59.168 --> 01:17:00.049]  Us being shut down?
[01:17:00.289 --> 01:17:01.310]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:02.771]  You know what, Alex?
[01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:03.891]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:04.732]  Hey, Frank!
[01:17:05.012 --> 01:17:10.375]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:17:10.675 --> 01:17:14.957]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:18.059]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:17:18.339 --> 01:17:18.719]  You understand?
[01:17:18.799 --> 01:17:20.060]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.561]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:17:22.561 --> 01:17:27.445]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.473]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[01:17:38.693 --> 01:17:42.137]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:43.758]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[01:17:43.799 --> 01:17:44.619]  They're suing me.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.061]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[01:17:46.521 --> 01:17:48.323]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[01:17:48.343 --> 01:17:49.725]  We were bringing $5 million in a year.
[01:17:49.985 --> 01:17:50.966]  It cost a lot to run this.
[01:17:51.126 --> 01:17:53.028]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[01:17:53.268 --> 01:17:54.750]  I keep growing more as fast as I can.
[01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:57.993]  And as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[01:17:58.293 --> 01:17:59.835]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[01:17:59.855 --> 01:18:00.436]  Tell him right there.
[01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:00.716]  Frank!
[01:18:00.996 --> 01:18:01.556]  Hey, Frank!
[01:18:01.816 --> 01:18:03.057]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[01:18:03.477 --> 01:18:09.059]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention, although of course everybody likes a little bit of attention, it's nice.
[01:18:09.239 --> 01:18:19.563]  But I can't do TV and I can't do radio and I can't publish books and I can't sell anything and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[01:18:19.683 --> 01:18:22.424]  Yeah, exactly, using every resource at their disposal.
[01:18:22.484 --> 01:18:26.326]  So it's not bragging, it's a daily reality and that's why you've got to support things like Infowars and...
[01:18:26.986 --> 01:18:29.167]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[01:18:29.187 --> 01:18:29.688]  We're doing it now.
[01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:30.908]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:18:48.979 --> 01:18:49.600]  We're fighting!
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.201]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[01:18:51.261 --> 01:18:55.524]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.
[01:18:55.845 --> 01:18:59.327]  If you make examples of us and fund us, we will be victorious and you win.
[01:18:59.347 --> 01:19:00.128]  Do you understand?
[01:19:00.148 --> 01:19:01.329]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.263]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:13.087]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.

[01:19:50.107 --> 01:19:55.208]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.

[01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:01.371]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:20:06.337 --> 01:20:09.099]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.811 --> 01:20:26.893]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:27.313 --> 01:20:29.114]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.174 --> 01:20:32.217]  It's the time of the season.
[01:20:37.863 --> 01:21:03.074]  The big question for Larry Pratt, we're going to him in just one moment, gunowners.org, is what is the political calculus when the left has already been so brainwashed to hate Trump and Reagan Democrats are still going to vote for Trump if he delivers on the economy, which he is, all you do is turn your base off
[01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:15.214]  And demoralize them to not fight when he already re-announced his campaign 900 days out, 980-something days out, because they're already campaigning against him.
[01:21:15.674 --> 01:21:18.936]  He needs his base fired up, engaged, foaming at the mouth.
[01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:21.697]  Not disillusioned.
[01:21:21.817 --> 01:21:27.439]  I know maybe the calculus is, if they do this, everybody will wake because now maybe the Second Amendment's under attack.
[01:21:27.459 --> 01:21:29.840]  Maybe it's super sophisticated 3-D chess.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.481]  I mean, I can kind of war game this, but I don't think that's what it is.
[01:21:32.501 --> 01:21:33.241]  I think it's him trying to get
[01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:38.203]  Points with the press to get them off his back, and I think that'll just make him intensified.
[01:21:38.223 --> 01:21:43.325]  George W. Bush ratified and signed on to Biden's all the assault weapon stuff.
[01:21:43.645 --> 01:21:46.406]  It's Republicans that keep giving us this stuff by being bullied.
[01:21:46.787 --> 01:21:47.227]  It's crazy.
[01:21:47.247 --> 01:21:50.568]  We'll talk to Larry Pratt here and find out how we get out of this in a minute, but first off...
[01:21:51.906 --> 01:22:00.088]  You fight back by joining the NRA, the folks that keep them honest, you join gunowners.org, that's even more important, and you support this broadcast.
[01:22:00.408 --> 01:22:04.289]  They've taken down Dr. Corsi's YouTube, violates none of their rules, they had to put it back up.
[01:22:04.329 --> 01:22:05.610]  They said rogue employees did it.
[01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:06.630]  That's major news.
[01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:09.071]  Yes, rogue employees put fake strikes on us.
[01:22:09.111 --> 01:22:13.012]  Well, CNN bragged that they were working with the insiders at YouTube to do it.
[01:22:13.452 --> 01:22:13.992]  Did you hear that?
[01:22:14.472 --> 01:22:16.873]  YouTube's in Bloomberg saying rogue employees did it.
[01:22:17.918 --> 01:22:20.660]  And CNN says they were talking to the employees, getting them to do it.
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:23.821]  I mean, CNN is trying to shut us down.
[01:22:24.462 --> 01:22:27.023]  Launched the campaign last Friday, seven days ago.
[01:22:28.344 --> 01:22:31.225]  I know for a fact they're offering people big money to lie about me, folks.
[01:22:31.425 --> 01:22:32.306]  And we knew it was coming.
[01:22:33.867 --> 01:22:40.610]  And in the case that they picked to do it in, it's unbelievably phony like Swiss cheese.
[01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:42.191]  The holes are very easy to disprove.
[01:22:42.211 --> 01:22:45.093]  I just feel sorry for the people that got, you know, induced into it.
[01:22:46.764 --> 01:22:56.347]  And later I'm going to let them know that there's still time to come forward and admit who paid you and why they did it and the rest of it, because we already know.
[01:22:56.848 --> 01:22:59.849]  But we'll just let you go through that process.
[01:23:00.689 --> 01:23:02.990]  Now, again, we have Operation Paul Revere 2018.
[01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:07.651]  It's 30 to 80 percent off, and we're talking about our best sellers.
[01:23:07.671 --> 01:23:11.633]  I mean, I sold out of our Super Tumor, our bodies.
[01:23:12.884 --> 01:23:15.306]  I told you I was selling out.
[01:23:15.326 --> 01:23:16.747]  So a bunch of stuff selling out.
[01:23:17.067 --> 01:23:18.228]  Biome Defense, 50% off.
[01:23:18.248 --> 01:23:19.909]  Great Probiotic, Trueway, 50% off.
[01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:22.251]  Prebiotic Fiber, that's our newest product.
[01:23:22.551 --> 01:23:23.492]  It's the best source fiber.
[01:23:23.512 --> 01:23:26.154]  It's really amazing, concentrated, super high quality.
[01:23:26.475 --> 01:23:29.217]  Infowars Life, select products, 40% off.
[01:23:29.837 --> 01:23:30.778]  Clearance Apparel, 80% off.
[01:23:30.818 --> 01:23:32.179]  That's some of our best stuff.
[01:23:32.199 --> 01:23:33.140]  There's just so much apparel.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.801]  Some stuff sells out, some doesn't.
[01:23:34.821 --> 01:23:36.702]  So there's some great deals and amazing shirts.
[01:23:37.683 --> 01:23:38.844]  Sweatshirts and caps, you name it.
[01:23:39.184 --> 01:23:41.026]  Aegis body armor for backpack inserts.
[01:23:41.046 --> 01:23:43.167]  Very lightweight, uh, nanotech stuff.
[01:23:43.267 --> 01:23:44.969]  It's, uh, it's 20% off.
[01:23:45.009 --> 01:23:46.090]  Already a very, very low price.
[01:23:47.577 --> 01:23:53.761]  I mean, 200 bucks for some backpack, high-quality, high-tech, space-age stuff's a great deal, and 20% off, that's an even better deal.
[01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:59.164]  So, check it all out, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:23:59.604 --> 01:24:00.985]  And we've got free shipping for a while.
[01:24:01.005 --> 01:24:09.651]  I should have... There's so many deals, I can't get into all of it, but these deals are so big, we need to sell a lot of product to be able to face this, and I've got to have the lawyers,
[01:24:11.198 --> 01:24:14.220]  And a lot of other stuff, you know, we're going to have to put into motion here.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:16.642]  Because let me tell you, this is like a James Bond movie around here.
[01:24:17.122 --> 01:24:22.005]  And we've got to have counterintelligence, intelligence, we've got to have it all.
[01:24:22.045 --> 01:24:23.426]  This is the info war.
[01:24:23.466 --> 01:24:27.869]  And we're at this level now where it's every day I have to make the right decisions or we go down.
[01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:30.771]  Which will be its own spectacular victory against the Globals.
[01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:33.713]  That's going to blow up really big if they kill me or set me up or whatever.
[01:24:34.053 --> 01:24:36.935]  I mean, we see them launch the attack and then the support comes.
[01:24:37.296 --> 01:24:38.937]  But what's scary is it's like spiritual.
[01:24:38.977 --> 01:24:40.558]  It's always just enough to beat them.
[01:24:41.359 --> 01:24:42.420]  And it's always just enough.
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.747]  And I'm like, God, if we had a whole bunch more money, we could really beat him.
[01:24:46.807 --> 01:24:49.091]  No, it's always just enough, just enough, just enough.
[01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:51.234]  So you guys, it's like magic.
[01:24:51.254 --> 01:24:54.499]  You just come through with exactly what we need, never really more.
[01:24:56.165 --> 01:24:57.626]  It's God.
[01:24:57.886 --> 01:25:00.148]  Going back to Larry, you've got the floor the last four minutes.
[01:25:00.168 --> 01:25:01.369]  I appreciate you holding while I plug.
[01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:02.430]  Keep us afloat here.
[01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:03.411]  Gunowners.org.
[01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.832]  I can give the number out as well.
[01:25:05.213 --> 01:25:06.394]  In closing, you heard my points.
[01:25:06.454 --> 01:25:08.616]  What's the calculus?
[01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:10.377]  I mean, even if he was Machiavelli, he's winning.
[01:25:10.677 --> 01:25:11.698]  Why is he doing this?
[01:25:11.778 --> 01:25:14.421]  And what do we do to get him back on the straight and narrow?
[01:25:15.788 --> 01:25:24.690]  Well, if folks go to GunOwners.org, they can give a substantial boost to getting the President back in line, getting back on the rails.
[01:25:25.551 --> 01:25:34.833]  GunOwners.org, you can sign up right on the link from the front page to get the free email alerts, and they're what enable you to be like Paul Revere.
[01:25:34.873 --> 01:25:42.175]  You can just spread the word, you can get your email sent up from what we send you, and the whole thing probably takes less than 30 seconds.
[01:25:42.595 --> 01:25:58.989]  Now, the battle that we're fighting right now, besides trying to get the President back on the rails, is to stop the gun bill that's in the Congress, because they're talking about putting Dianne Feinstein's semi-automatic ban on what at one time was a good piece of legislation.
[01:25:59.349 --> 01:26:00.590]  That's some time ago now.
[01:26:01.131 --> 01:26:04.734]  But that, I think, if they really try to do that,
[01:26:05.334 --> 01:26:14.123]  Would almost certainly be an important mistake because they would be putting something up where they may not even have 40 votes.
[01:26:15.345 --> 01:26:28.248]  Uh, for that measure, and if they will then leave their tank forth the bridge and it's going to block the ability of other measures in the gun control agenda to get across that bridge.
[01:26:28.628 --> 01:26:35.270]  So we think that they if they proceed that way, they're likely to find that they've shot themselves in the foot.
[01:26:35.936 --> 01:26:38.459]  And let's hope that we can indeed pull that off.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:54.538]  And once we're in that posture, once it's the Feinstein bill they're blocking, somebody, some senator, a good guy has to do is say, I object to the next move, which would be to get around it, to set aside, bring up other gun control measures.
[01:26:55.198 --> 01:27:00.260]  One person saying, I object, and the whole enterprise gets shut down.
[01:27:00.801 --> 01:27:09.024]  And we can hold them in that position for a fairly long period of time while we continue, hopefully, to build our own support and our own forces.
[01:27:10.885 --> 01:27:21.750]  Who would have thought, because he did the right thing after Vegas, and pointed out that it was all illegal, what happened, there was a stand-down, Islamic connections, you name it, and the media
[01:27:23.627 --> 01:27:26.069]  Backed off because the story fell apart, whatever really happened.
[01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:29.151]  And then now with this, this is blood in the water.
[01:27:29.251 --> 01:27:40.200]  I've got a, it looks like an exclusive about another county with our connections in Florida, where another person says they're going to shoot people as a Democrat sheriff and the report is they've let the person go.
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:45.163]  So, I mean, it just, it just continues to happen.
[01:27:45.584 --> 01:27:48.166]  Doesn't Trump understand that this will destroy him?
[01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:51.048]  Does he understand that the base isn't going to put up with this?
[01:27:52.515 --> 01:27:55.137]  You would think the answer to that would be, of course he understands that.
[01:27:55.617 --> 01:28:01.941]  But right now, the question's legitimate, because what he's done is certainly not helpful to himself.
[01:28:02.321 --> 01:28:11.266]  And unless he has some plan, as I was mentioning earlier, to game the Democrats and some of the anti-gun Republicans, he's headed down the wrong path.
[01:28:11.366 --> 01:28:19.191]  And he'd better for sure have a way back to where he came from, because otherwise it's not going to end well politically for him at all.
[01:28:19.451 --> 01:28:25.094]  Well, exactly, and Feinstein and others' body language was just, they were in ecstasy because her own party's about to throw her overboard.
[01:28:25.354 --> 01:28:27.515]  This makes her look strong to go ahead and get the nomination.
[01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.636]  Yeah, rubbing her hands together like a giant rat.
[01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:33.438]  And so, I mean, there's just... Like the Wicked Witch of the West.
[01:28:33.759 --> 01:28:35.019]  It's an incredible photo.
[01:28:35.039 --> 01:28:36.020]  I'm so glad you got it.
[01:28:36.724 --> 01:28:45.146]  Well, sir, if it wasn't for GunOwners.org, because I was there watching to keep the NRA somewhat honest, and it wasn't people like Ted Nugent, we wouldn't be here today with the Second Amendment left.
[01:28:45.166 --> 01:28:45.906]  So God bless you.
[01:28:46.326 --> 01:28:47.527]  We salute you, Larry Pratt.
[01:28:47.747 --> 01:28:48.907]  GunOwners.org.
[01:28:48.927 --> 01:28:49.547]  And what's the number?
[01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:53.328]  Uh, 888-886-GUNS.
[01:28:54.628 --> 01:28:57.489]  But mostly people use the internet these days, I'm happy to say.
[01:28:57.769 --> 01:28:58.689]  I know they do, brother.
[01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:59.349]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:59.369 --> 01:28:59.870]  We're in a fight.
[01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:00.670]  We're going to fight together.
[01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:01.190]  We salute you.

[01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:25.498]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the super blue fluoride free mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[01:29:25.658 --> 01:29:32.059]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:42.422]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:29:42.642 --> 01:29:49.083]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:29:49.443 --> 01:29:52.024]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[01:29:52.304 --> 01:29:55.627]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride free products.
[01:29:55.927 --> 01:30:00.812]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:00.912 --> 01:30:02.814]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:05.549 --> 01:30:07.211]  If you don't buy the products, we're not here.
[01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:09.693]  And these are products you really need.
[01:30:09.934 --> 01:30:14.779]  We go out and research the market, what's popular, what people want, what people like, what works.
[01:30:14.939 --> 01:30:17.201]  We then go to the top organic producers in the country.
[01:30:17.221 --> 01:30:19.264]  We've got four different companies that make our products.
[01:30:19.324 --> 01:30:21.606]  We've got 60-something different supplements now.
[01:30:21.726 --> 01:30:25.750]  And we say, who makes the strongest turmeric product on the market?
[01:30:26.411 --> 01:30:28.413]  And they say, from the test, it's this one.
[01:30:28.814 --> 01:30:30.916]  But we only make what people ask us to make.
[01:30:31.036 --> 01:30:31.817]  We make this one.
[01:30:31.877 --> 01:30:39.225]  It's got 100 milligrams of curcumin in it, but it's about 70 percent, this is a talk we had, concentrate of curcumin in those milligrams.
[01:30:39.285 --> 01:30:41.287]  And they go, but the industry standard's about 3 percent.
[01:30:41.367 --> 01:30:44.451]  We went out and found 95 percent curcuminoid.
[01:30:44.571 --> 01:30:47.394]  That's just one ingredient in BODY's Ultimate Tumor Formula.
[01:30:47.634 --> 01:30:52.639]  When I say ultimate, it is the most powerful concentrated that we can find.
[01:30:52.919 --> 01:30:58.445]  Somebody may have something stronger, but when I tell you it's the strongest, it's the strongest we can find.
[01:30:58.625 --> 01:31:00.146]  It's also the most expensive for us.
[01:31:00.266 --> 01:31:02.488]  They're selling turmeric for 50, 60 bucks.
[01:31:02.569 --> 01:31:05.031]  It's 3% and got maybe 50 milligrams in it.
[01:31:05.051 --> 01:31:06.372]  A lot of the competition, okay?
[01:31:06.612 --> 01:31:09.916]  So that's what all the products are like, okay?
[01:31:09.956 --> 01:31:10.917]  My brain works like this.
[01:31:11.437 --> 01:31:12.818]  This melatonin is $19.95.
[01:31:13.018 --> 01:31:13.879]  It's 3 milligrams.
[01:31:14.199 --> 01:31:16.001]  How much does melatonin cost?
[01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:18.583]  Uh, maybe 30, 40 cents for that dose.
[01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:19.704]  And the bottle costs 50 cents.
[01:31:19.764 --> 01:31:21.866]  I'm like, okay, well, did I talk to the scientists?
[01:31:22.186 --> 01:31:28.892]  And the developers, I say, can we stick L-tryptophan with the melatonin, with the valerian root, with the lemon balm, with the mayo?
[01:31:28.912 --> 01:31:30.253]  Yeah, you can do all that very safely.
[01:31:30.293 --> 01:31:31.394]  And how much will all that cost?
[01:31:31.894 --> 01:31:33.015]  It'll cost you $5.
[01:31:33.356 --> 01:31:34.817]  Nobody puts that much stuff in one of these.
[01:31:35.017 --> 01:31:37.459]  I'm putting $5 in it and I'm going to sell it for $19.95.
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:43.805]  What whacked out world are you going to sit there and put 50 cents in something and sell it for $19.95?
[01:31:44.506 --> 01:31:49.010]  So I'm marking this stuff up, but I'm telling you folks, it's crazy how the industry works.
[01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:54.615]  And that's why they go and they test our stuff and they go, well, this is the top rated vitamin B12, but Jones, this is Jones's.
[01:31:54.795 --> 01:31:57.878]  It is pure vitamin B12, like he says, but this one's the best.
[01:31:58.078 --> 01:31:59.639]  And then it's the one we're private-labeled.
[01:31:59.679 --> 01:32:01.821]  So that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:01.921 --> 01:32:03.162]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:03.182 --> 01:32:04.864]  You're going to get supplements that are amazing.
[01:32:04.904 --> 01:32:06.225]  You're going to get products that are incredible.
[01:32:06.265 --> 01:32:12.750]  And you're going to get products that help you and your family while standing against the globalists and knowing that they hate us so much.
[01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:14.111]  They want to destroy us so bad.
[01:32:14.372 --> 01:32:19.776]  They spend so much time coming after us and lying about us and trying to wreck our lives because we know who they are.
[01:32:20.156 --> 01:32:24.060]  And when you breathe life into us and you spread the articles and the videos, it changes the whole world.
[01:32:24.921 --> 01:32:30.065]  And I want to expand their face, because let me tell you something, if we shrink, they're going to lay it on even more.
[01:32:30.105 --> 01:32:34.328]  We've got to grow, we've got to show them we're growing, and we've got to get stronger.
[01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:35.189]  And by the way, we are.
[01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:38.672]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger, to give you another Nietzsche quote.
[01:32:40.646 --> 01:32:41.646]  But it's because of you.
[01:32:41.966 --> 01:32:42.586]  It's because of you.
[01:32:42.606 --> 01:32:55.529]  So I salute you, I thank you, I appreciate you, and I just want to ask you to just remember us in your prayers, and remember the products, and remember these are great products for you and your family, and they're essential to fund the operation.
[01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:56.309]  It's a 360 win.
[01:32:56.609 --> 01:32:58.389]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:58.409 --> 01:32:59.749]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.536 --> 01:33:22.037]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.417]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.677 --> 01:33:29.239]  My head is just spinning right now.
[01:33:40.566 --> 01:33:56.038]  All over England, all over Sweden, all over Germany, all over France, all over Belgium, and other places, if a woman shares a meme that shows an ISIS member with crap for brains, she gets arrested and put in prison and strip-searched.
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:00.282]  I mean, they're putting 70-year-old women in jail for months.
[01:34:01.723 --> 01:34:04.665]  And it has them begging on the news, apologizing for what they've done.
[01:34:04.685 --> 01:34:10.110]  And you have an extension of that, YouTube,
[01:34:13.103 --> 01:34:14.624]  Tried to ban our channel.
[01:34:15.245 --> 01:34:19.748]  CNN was on the news saying, we reported that they said nobody died.
[01:34:20.028 --> 01:34:20.849]  We're working with them.
[01:34:20.889 --> 01:34:21.830]  We put in the complaint.
[01:34:22.450 --> 01:34:23.811]  A so-called news organization.
[01:34:24.151 --> 01:34:25.332]  Total tortious interference.
[01:34:25.633 --> 01:34:26.393]  Total racketeering.
[01:34:26.413 --> 01:34:27.734]  I got a lawyer right here, Mike Cernovich.
[01:34:27.934 --> 01:34:28.635]  He'll give us his take.
[01:34:28.795 --> 01:34:29.856]  But I've talked to my lawyers.
[01:34:31.417 --> 01:34:38.063]  And I've talked to Veritas and all the other people that caught them on video, YouTube, saying our job is to censor Alex Jones, people like him.
[01:34:38.483 --> 01:34:42.427]  And they have Facebook and Twitter employees going, also American flags and veterans.
[01:34:43.188 --> 01:34:45.209]  Just veterans are called dumb rednecks.
[01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:48.012]  Black, white, Hispanic, you're scum too.
[01:34:50.054 --> 01:34:52.216]  You really realize these people, they're globalists.
[01:34:52.236 --> 01:34:55.539]  They think of everybody who's pro-America as some dumb idiot.
[01:34:57.810 --> 01:35:04.996]  We got video from Campus Reform where a professor, one of the head professors of the university walks over and goes, oh I see you're paid by the Russians!
[01:35:05.076 --> 01:35:06.818]  And it's NRA stuff.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.862]  And anti-socialism pamphlets and pro-gun pamphlets.
[01:35:11.902 --> 01:35:16.265]  And the guy sits there and debates them and goes, I really know that you're Russians.
[01:35:16.806 --> 01:35:18.587]  And then this fake EEOC complaint about me.
[01:35:18.888 --> 01:35:23.652]  They just, Hillary Clinton's, it's Hillary's former personal lawyer.
[01:35:24.072 --> 01:35:24.873]  He brags about it.
[01:35:25.683 --> 01:35:29.646]  He worked for her when he got out of college at Georgetown and was her personal assistant.
[01:35:30.047 --> 01:35:31.027]  And then a lawyer for her.
[01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:40.175]  He says I'm a liar and all this stuff and that this EEOC thing will just add to all of it.
[01:35:40.195 --> 01:35:41.596]  So he makes a political statement in it.
[01:35:43.818 --> 01:35:50.183]  And then they say that I have a Russian operative that handles me in the EEOC report.
[01:35:50.263 --> 01:35:51.064]  I mean, folks.
[01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:57.097]  You know how desperate they are that they're now putting in EEOC complaints that there are Russians.
[01:35:57.418 --> 01:35:58.739]  Yes, Daria was born in Russia.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.041]  Yes, she's an army veteran.
[01:36:00.342 --> 01:36:01.223]  Yes, she's a patriot.
[01:36:01.603 --> 01:36:02.925]  And it's so crazy.
[01:36:03.186 --> 01:36:04.087]  How about discriminatory?
[01:36:04.367 --> 01:36:08.093]  They're saying we're bad because someone born in Russia works here, and that's the proof.
[01:36:10.563 --> 01:36:22.949]  And again, she's a combat veteran, whole nine yards, honorably discharged, you honorably serve your country, and you have a Russian background, and you are the devil, and you are just convicted.
[01:36:22.969 --> 01:36:24.030]  All right, let's go to Mike Cernovich.
[01:36:25.351 --> 01:36:28.232]  Because he is, I was thinking about him like three days ago.
[01:36:28.252 --> 01:36:30.513]  I'm not kidding.
[01:36:30.653 --> 01:36:33.575]  I'm sitting there at night, driving home, and I'm thinking about him.
[01:36:34.515 --> 01:36:35.976]  Boy, he had the idea to protest Google.
[01:36:35.996 --> 01:36:37.477]  I mean, we've done it before as well, but he had the idea.
[01:36:37.617 --> 01:36:39.138]  We have to get out there with our censorship, and then
[01:36:40.182 --> 01:36:43.993]  They had the whole Charlottesville thing, and Google said, oh, people are planning to attack us.
[01:36:44.053 --> 01:36:45.839]  We knew it was a setup, so we canceled them.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:51.422]  But I was thinking about it, and then I get home, and the text comes in saying, hey, we got to do this for our lives.
[01:36:51.462 --> 01:36:53.183]  We got to fight for the First Amendment right here.
[01:36:53.203 --> 01:36:53.924]  This is the takeover.
[01:36:53.944 --> 01:36:54.624]  You got to do it, Alex.
[01:36:54.944 --> 01:36:56.285]  And so he's been busy the last few days.
[01:36:56.305 --> 01:36:57.686]  So we've got him on to talk about it.
[01:36:57.966 --> 01:36:58.746]  He's absolutely right.
[01:36:58.766 --> 01:37:00.787]  South by Southwest is coming up in a couple of weeks in Austin.
[01:37:01.128 --> 01:37:01.928]  They're all going to be here.
[01:37:02.348 --> 01:37:05.910]  And he wants to coordinate this from behind the scenes so they don't know when we're coming, when you're coming.
[01:37:06.210 --> 01:37:08.691]  And I think he's a good leader, so I'm going to let him honcho this.
[01:37:09.052 --> 01:37:09.952]  But I'm going to work with him.
[01:37:09.972 --> 01:37:10.993]  But watch this channel.
[01:37:11.773 --> 01:37:21.768]  When the South by Southwest is going on, for what we're going to do, it's going to be legal and lawful, but they are so scared of us physically showing up because they only want cyber control.
[01:37:22.625 --> 01:37:24.266]  They're totally afraid of grassroots.
[01:37:24.707 --> 01:37:36.996]  So, Mike Cernovich, what would you say, historically, the point we've reached now, with just this whole cornucopia of insanity and Trump starting to go sideways, and, but our YouTube, of course his YouTube channel was taken down, they put it back up today.
[01:37:37.276 --> 01:37:39.337]  YouTube apologizes and said we have rogues.
[01:37:40.098 --> 01:37:42.880]  I mean, what, this is a real civil war in the country.
[01:37:44.246 --> 01:37:50.669]  Well, Alex, I'm usually a positive and upbeat guy, but I'm not positive and upbeat about this.
[01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:52.510]  It's life or death now.
[01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:54.731]  This isn't the usual, oh, we're under it.
[01:37:54.771 --> 01:37:55.872]  We're always under attack.
[01:37:56.272 --> 01:37:58.333]  This isn't the usual, we're under an attack.
[01:37:58.373 --> 01:37:59.834]  Thank you for the support, share, links.
[01:37:59.894 --> 01:38:00.294]  No, no, no.
[01:38:00.735 --> 01:38:02.015]  This is, we are done.
[01:38:02.235 --> 01:38:03.216]  We're off the internet.
[01:38:03.236 --> 01:38:03.996]  They're banning us.
[01:38:04.477 --> 01:38:05.417]  And not just us.
[01:38:06.057 --> 01:38:07.078]  If you're a Christian,
[01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:12.173]  Snopes and Facebook are now trying to ban Christians from Facebook.
[01:38:12.533 --> 01:38:20.859]  What they're doing now is if you write Christian content on Facebook, Snopes will say, well, we're fact-checking this and this actually isn't true.
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:25.963]  And then Facebook threatened to ban a Christian website called the Babylon Bee.
[01:38:26.003 --> 01:38:29.706]  They do satire and jokes because Snopes fact-checked
[01:38:30.446 --> 01:38:32.628]  A satirical funny article to ban them.
[01:38:32.688 --> 01:38:34.909]  So this is not about you or me.
[01:38:34.969 --> 01:38:38.071]  If you're a Christian in America, the tech companies hate you.
[01:38:38.131 --> 01:38:39.012]  They're going to ban you.
[01:38:39.432 --> 01:38:43.055]  This is not, again, usually I'm like, oh, under attack.
[01:38:43.095 --> 01:38:43.575]  I feel good.
[01:38:43.595 --> 01:38:44.216]  This is fun.
[01:38:44.636 --> 01:38:46.437]  No, they want us in gulags, Alex.
[01:38:46.517 --> 01:38:47.478]  I don't know what more to say.
[01:38:47.498 --> 01:38:48.678]  Death camps are coming.
[01:38:49.019 --> 01:38:53.962]  When you're a Christian and you can't make a joke on Facebook as a Christian,
[01:38:54.142 --> 01:38:54.602]  And by the way,
[01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:16.651]  The first Methodist church all over the country is removing crosses because they're offensive.
[01:39:16.931 --> 01:39:20.572]  In Europe they're removing crosses from Catholic churches, Presbyterian, Baptist.
[01:39:20.973 --> 01:39:23.673]  This is a total ecumenical UN global takeover.
[01:39:23.693 --> 01:39:24.634]  The Pope's a globalist.
[01:39:24.874 --> 01:39:25.894]  They're making their move.
[01:39:25.914 --> 01:39:26.794]  You're absolutely right.
[01:39:27.074 --> 01:39:28.255]  And I meant to mention that.
[01:39:28.815 --> 01:39:33.396]  All over Christian YouTubes, Prager University's in a lawsuit because they're trying to ban them and have banned them.
[01:39:33.816 --> 01:39:38.538]  Very professional, very loving, very well done, very fatherly.
[01:39:39.542 --> 01:39:40.423]  That's being banned.
[01:39:41.203 --> 01:39:44.226]  And all over, Christians are being blocked from being able to share.
[01:39:44.566 --> 01:39:49.370]  And notice Google Assistant says, Christ is a fictional character.
[01:39:49.871 --> 01:39:51.512]  So yes, this is an assault.
[01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:53.213]  This is crazy.
[01:39:53.554 --> 01:40:01.380]  You should think Google, Facebook, Twitter would want one of the biggest minorities in the country now, Christians, you know, of every group, to be on their platforms.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.982]  But no, they want to socially control you.
[01:40:04.002 --> 01:40:04.743]  This is incredible.
[01:40:06.038 --> 01:40:14.743]  Yeah, they want to take away our guns, they want to take away our free speech, and they want to put Christians in death camps, and they can clip that snippet, but they'll never argue it.
[01:40:15.163 --> 01:40:18.825]  They'll never say, they'll go, oh, look, Sernich claims they want death camps.
[01:40:18.845 --> 01:40:25.289]  Why do they want to take away our guns, and why do they want to take away our free speech rights and our rights to peaceably assemble and censor us?
[01:40:25.369 --> 01:40:26.650]  What is the endgame of that?
[01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:31.493]  They want to bankrupt people, they want to ruin people's reputations, they want to destroy people.
[01:40:32.153 --> 01:40:35.375]  They went after Pamela Gellar's daughters, four Jewish women,
[01:40:35.775 --> 01:40:40.961]  Merely because of who her mom is, these girls are now facing death threats from jihadis.
[01:40:40.981 --> 01:40:42.243]  This is not a joke, Alex.
[01:40:42.523 --> 01:40:43.644]  This is not a fun thing.
[01:40:43.685 --> 01:40:46.248]  No, I know the jihadis are the foot soldiers of the left now.
[01:40:46.728 --> 01:40:48.090]  We now know they are the muscle.
[01:40:49.764 --> 01:40:52.647]  Yeah, so people go, oh, Mike, you've been a little somber lately.
[01:40:52.687 --> 01:40:57.571]  You've been a little... Well, right, because I'm a realistic person and I know that they want us murdered.
[01:40:57.691 --> 01:40:58.752]  They want us killed now.
[01:40:59.092 --> 01:41:01.714]  And it isn't just you and me and people on the front lines now.
[01:41:01.974 --> 01:41:09.381]  If you're a listener and you're just a Christian who wants to tell some jokes and have fun with your friends and maybe go to church on Sundays and pray,
[01:41:10.061 --> 01:41:12.523]  You're now a target by Facebook.
[01:41:12.563 --> 01:41:13.863]  You're now a target by Snopes.
[01:41:14.204 --> 01:41:16.665]  They will do everything they can to run you off the internet.
[01:41:16.885 --> 01:41:18.546]  They will do everything they can to disarm you.
[01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:20.547]  They're saying that we want to disarm you.
[01:41:20.567 --> 01:41:22.248]  We want to take away your free speech rights.
[01:41:22.588 --> 01:41:25.190]  They want to take away every means we have to fight back.
[01:41:25.999 --> 01:41:27.742]  That is how you have a holocaust.
[01:41:27.782 --> 01:41:29.764]  That is how you have Pol Pot's death camps.
[01:41:30.165 --> 01:41:31.346]  That's how you have the Soviet Union.
[01:41:31.386 --> 01:41:40.959]  And Mike, Mike, as you know, Snopes, the Young Turks, Media Matters is all funded by George Soros who are all now saying he's a holocaust survivor and that I'm defaming him and that he fought the Nazis.
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:44.943]  When he was admittedly a Nazi collaborator in his own words, it's next level.
[01:41:45.063 --> 01:41:53.549]  Snopes runs it all, and everywhere, in front of our stuff, your stuff, they put Snopes, even in front of Fox News, and then Snopes just says, this is not true.
[01:41:53.969 --> 01:41:57.451]  Snopes basically says a Muslim didn't attack a few months ago with a truck in New York.
[01:41:58.112 --> 01:41:59.373]  I mean, they just do whatever they want.
[01:42:00.936 --> 01:42:16.041]  Yeah, well, and the latest, and that's why I think the attack on the Babylon Bee is really such an important thing, because as you know, YouTube has given me a community guideline strike because I uploaded a video of a protest by Antifa.
[01:42:16.481 --> 01:42:19.202]  Not anything that I said, not anything that I'd done.
[01:42:19.522 --> 01:42:27.445]  All I did was journalistically uploaded a video of a protest of Antifa, and Facebook has issued me a community guideline strike and censored my channel.
[01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:33.341]  They're going after journalism because they don't want, this is what I have to tell the Christians, you have to listen.
[01:42:34.159 --> 01:42:40.841]  Antifa and Jihadis are the foot soldiers of the left, and that is why YouTube is banning anyone.
[01:42:41.361 --> 01:42:47.544]  If you report on Antifa, they don't want the Christians to know, because eventually Antifa, they're protesting me and Alex.
[01:42:47.824 --> 01:42:48.624]  They're coming for you.
[01:42:48.644 --> 01:42:50.064]  They're coming for your churches.
[01:42:50.104 --> 01:42:54.446]  They come with guns and won't let our reporters on the Capitol and the police say, sorry, it's Blue City.
[01:42:54.686 --> 01:42:57.147]  They're allowed to have guns and violate your free speech in Austin.
[01:42:57.527 --> 01:42:58.567]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:42:59.308 --> 01:43:00.408]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:02.597 --> 01:43:04.918]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:43:04.958 --> 01:43:06.679]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:43:07.099 --> 01:43:09.980]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:22.104]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[01:43:22.544 --> 01:43:31.648]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture, Floralife, as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[01:43:32.128 --> 01:43:37.693]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[01:43:37.913 --> 01:43:43.078]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[01:43:43.359 --> 01:43:45.320]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[01:43:45.621 --> 01:43:47.642]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:51.725]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:53.327]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:43:53.948 --> 01:43:56.513]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:43:57.274 --> 01:43:59.238]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:43:59.799 --> 01:44:02.062]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[01:44:06.809 --> 01:44:09.911]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:44:09.931 --> 01:44:10.471]  You're on the air.
[01:44:10.491 --> 01:44:11.632]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:11.652 --> 01:44:12.513]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:44:12.733 --> 01:44:13.313]  Hey, brother.
[01:44:13.634 --> 01:44:13.974]  Good, man.
[01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:14.814]  Thank you for calling.
[01:44:14.894 --> 01:44:15.455]  Hey, hey.
[01:44:15.555 --> 01:44:19.938]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:44:20.178 --> 01:44:26.542]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:44:26.662 --> 01:44:28.363]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[01:44:28.463 --> 01:44:34.627]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:44:35.768 --> 01:44:36.889]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:44:36.949 --> 01:44:39.390]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:40.951]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:44:41.351 --> 01:44:42.992]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:44:43.392 --> 01:44:44.132]  And exactly.
[01:44:44.152 --> 01:44:48.454]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:44:48.755 --> 01:44:49.015]  Boom!
[01:44:49.155 --> 01:44:51.996]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:44:52.056 --> 01:44:52.596]  It's amazing.
[01:44:52.636 --> 01:44:53.937]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[01:44:54.017 --> 01:44:56.859]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:45:02.301 --> 01:45:09.984]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:45:10.864 --> 01:45:14.905]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:45:15.426 --> 01:45:17.766]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:45:18.547 --> 01:45:21.668]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:45:23.191 --> 01:45:35.314]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:45:36.014 --> 01:45:51.058]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:45:52.078 --> 01:45:55.781]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[01:45:56.341 --> 01:45:58.042]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:45:58.082 --> 01:46:00.323]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:07.754]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:46:08.054 --> 01:46:12.497]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:46:12.837 --> 01:46:21.183]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:46:21.524 --> 01:46:24.746]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[01:46:25.006 --> 01:46:29.952]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:46:30.273 --> 01:46:37.242]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:46:37.582 --> 01:46:41.187]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:46:41.487 --> 01:46:41.968]  That's why.
[01:46:42.008 --> 01:46:43.669]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:25.424 --> 01:47:29.368]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:29.848 --> 01:47:31.329]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.429 --> 01:47:45.382]  We're 32 hours, or 30 hours, we've got a few hours left of the global broadcast Operation Paul Revere 2000.
[01:47:48.817 --> 01:47:55.461]  2018.
[01:47:49.477 --> 01:47:55.461]  And I was already launching this, had the idea last week because of all the censorship, them taking sponsors again, trying to shut us down.
[01:47:57.442 --> 01:48:03.566]  I was already going to have this broadcast in defense of free speech, in defense of the Second Amendment, in defense of internet freedom.
[01:48:03.586 --> 01:48:05.647]  That was the promo that we put out.
[01:48:06.288 --> 01:48:08.629]  And then we got banned on YouTube.
[01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:10.170]  Then they reinstated us.
[01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:11.851]  They were blocking us uploading.
[01:48:12.252 --> 01:48:13.733]  Then they banned our sub-channels.
[01:48:13.773 --> 01:48:15.474]  They banned Dr. Corsi's DC channel.
[01:48:16.658 --> 01:48:18.520]  Which was getting millions of views a week.
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:22.183]  They saw it really catching on as he covered QAnon in the storm.
[01:48:22.203 --> 01:48:24.425]  And now Mike Cernovich is a lawyer.
[01:48:24.745 --> 01:48:25.586]  He can speak to this.
[01:48:26.146 --> 01:48:27.548]  I've never seen him so concerned.
[01:48:28.889 --> 01:48:29.669]  Because he should be.
[01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:30.450]  We all should be.
[01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:34.574]  Let's say past censorship was a 2 or 3 on the Richter scale.
[01:48:34.614 --> 01:48:36.175]  This is like a 9, okay?
[01:48:36.636 --> 01:48:38.237]  It's exponential each level up.
[01:48:38.497 --> 01:48:42.661]  And the next level is being totally silenced and arrested like in Europe.
[01:48:43.962 --> 01:48:51.067]  So, this is true decronianism, this is true, and I keep saying censorship, censorship, censorship, people are dull to that term.
[01:48:51.328 --> 01:48:53.729]  Mike's smart, because he's targeting what it is.
[01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:55.591]  It's a war on real journalism!
[01:48:56.411 --> 01:49:04.958]  Mike has real sources, I have real sources, you get tomorrow's news today, you get next week's news today, next year's news today, because we really don't just make stuff up like CNN.
[01:49:06.431 --> 01:49:08.432]  We told you this stuff was all fake.
[01:49:08.452 --> 01:49:09.512]  That's how they had to reverse it.
[01:49:09.572 --> 01:49:13.733]  We told you we had lawyers that were already letting YouTube know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:49:14.113 --> 01:49:17.774]  I'm not going to get into a lot of behind-the-scenes agreements and things, but we're on the move here.
[01:49:17.814 --> 01:49:19.755]  We're fighting, and I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:49:20.155 --> 01:49:21.555]  This is the second American Revolution.
[01:49:21.575 --> 01:49:23.576]  I don't have to get my arms and legs blown off.
[01:49:23.596 --> 01:49:31.738]  I don't have to march, you know, from Ticonderoga a hundred-something miles dragging giant, you know, guns till our shoes fall off and there's a trail of blood.
[01:49:32.779 --> 01:49:36.141]  And people's, you know, hundreds of people had to have their toes amputated.
[01:49:36.862 --> 01:49:37.462]  That's will.
[01:49:37.942 --> 01:49:38.603]  We don't have to do that.
[01:49:38.623 --> 01:49:41.985]  We just gotta take their lies, turn around and counterpunch every day.
[01:49:42.446 --> 01:49:43.126]  Like a video game.
[01:49:43.166 --> 01:49:44.307]  Just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:49:45.282 --> 01:49:45.922]  But never give up.
[01:49:46.282 --> 01:49:50.324]  We need to protest these people, we need to take action, and also know we're fighting hard for you.
[01:49:50.364 --> 01:49:55.687]  You cannot make a better investment than going to InfoWorksStore.com and getting books, videos, high-quality supplements.
[01:49:55.947 --> 01:50:03.951]  We got free shipping store-wide right now, and at discounts like these, we sell a lot of product, but it takes a lot of product to be sold at these prices because we don't make a lot.
[01:50:04.952 --> 01:50:09.694]  We don't have seven times markup like other supplement companies where they put almost nothing in it and then seven times mark it up.
[01:50:10.885 --> 01:50:13.346]  We were putting almost $50 a bottle in DNA Force.
[01:50:13.846 --> 01:50:19.069]  We reformulated it even stronger, got a bigger contract in, so we lowered the price for us to make it to $30, $32.
[01:50:19.509 --> 01:50:21.330]  Now we can lower the price.
[01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:22.850]  That's how that works.
[01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:24.851]  Nobody's putting $30 in a bottle.
[01:50:25.091 --> 01:50:25.371]  Okay?
[01:50:25.671 --> 01:50:26.312]  I mean, these are like...
[01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:28.109]  Hardcore.
[01:50:28.590 --> 01:50:29.710]  And we've got some stuff that's like $9.95.
[01:50:29.911 --> 01:50:37.155]  You know, we got colloidal silver, we got true whey, biome defense, free shipping store-wide, super male vitality, super female vitality, it's all there.
[01:50:37.475 --> 01:50:41.718]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:42.098 --> 01:50:44.540]  Our newest product is best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:50:45.808 --> 01:50:46.188]  It has.
[01:50:46.908 --> 01:50:48.849]  From the very best, from cranberries, you name it.
[01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:50.490]  It's concentrated.
[01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:51.330]  It's really good.
[01:50:51.370 --> 01:50:52.070]  It's really healthy.
[01:50:52.090 --> 01:50:53.951]  A lot of forms of fiber out there aren't too good.
[01:50:54.291 --> 01:50:58.413]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:58.773 --> 01:50:59.853]  You stand against Soros.
[01:51:00.093 --> 01:51:01.254]  You stand against the globalists.
[01:51:01.594 --> 01:51:06.756]  You stand against everything they're doing when you support people in the economy that support your freedoms.
[01:51:06.776 --> 01:51:14.999]  When you don't give all your money to the biggest supplement maker and seller in the world, Jeff Bezos, who has his publications saying, shut me down, any supplements or snake oil.
[01:51:15.379 --> 01:51:16.520]  So this is sick.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:24.404]  By the way, Cernovich has developed, I've taken it before, an amazing new kind of sports enhancer, new tropic gorilla mine.
[01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:25.565]  So also buy that from him.
[01:51:25.925 --> 01:51:31.008]  That's what this is all about, is building these economies is how we're going to turn things around.
[01:51:31.028 --> 01:51:32.829]  But Mike, let's get into your idea.
[01:51:33.710 --> 01:51:34.090]  Absolutely.
[01:51:34.110 --> 01:51:35.190]  We've got to protest Google.
[01:51:35.211 --> 01:51:36.791]  We've got to protest South by Southwest.
[01:51:37.072 --> 01:51:37.672]  You're going to come.
[01:51:37.692 --> 01:51:38.572]  I want to have you in the studio.
[01:51:38.873 --> 01:51:39.653]  We've got some ideas.
[01:51:39.733 --> 01:51:40.794]  I was already planning to do it.
[01:51:41.394 --> 01:51:43.476]  But I'm going to do it a few unannounced times and things.
[01:51:43.516 --> 01:51:44.197]  I'm just leaving it at that.
[01:51:44.257 --> 01:51:47.040]  As you know, the inside documents say I'm banned from their campus.
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:50.644]  What do we need to do to take this to the next level to fight back?
[01:51:52.642 --> 01:51:54.003]  Yeah, we need all of our people.
[01:51:54.043 --> 01:51:55.283]  And this is not optional.
[01:51:55.343 --> 01:51:56.944]  This is a red alert.
[01:51:57.444 --> 01:52:01.665]  Because again, it's just not about Alex or me or anybody else.
[01:52:01.865 --> 01:52:04.046]  It is about the war on Christians.
[01:52:04.266 --> 01:52:12.849]  Again, when Facebook is threatening Christian comedy websites with censure and banning, that tells you all you need to know about what is going on.
[01:52:13.429 --> 01:52:18.591]  All of these anti-Christian, anti-freedom tech companies are going to be in South by Southwest.
[01:52:19.111 --> 01:52:20.392]  So legally and lawfully,
[01:52:21.107 --> 01:52:26.094]  We need to show up and just peacefully assemble and ask them, why do you hate Christians?
[01:52:26.154 --> 01:52:27.476]  Why do you censor websites?
[01:52:27.937 --> 01:52:30.660]  Why do you not allow honest reporting on Antifa?
[01:52:31.061 --> 01:52:32.663]  Do you endorse political violence?
[01:52:32.683 --> 01:52:34.586]  Do you endorse what is happening on the streets?
[01:52:35.106 --> 01:52:35.928]  And we need to again,
[01:52:36.528 --> 01:52:40.169]  Peacefully and lawfully, just ask these tech companies at South by Southwest.
[01:52:40.529 --> 01:52:41.889]  Why do you hate Christians?
[01:52:41.969 --> 01:52:43.269]  Why do you want to censor people?
[01:52:43.649 --> 01:52:47.870]  Why do you support Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, which hates Jews?
[01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:51.931]  Because everybody tries to always say, oh, you know, Cernovich and Jones.
[01:52:51.971 --> 01:52:53.451]  We love the Jewish people.
[01:52:53.491 --> 01:52:54.372]  We love Israel.
[01:52:54.612 --> 01:52:55.772]  We have no problems at all.
[01:52:55.812 --> 01:52:57.372]  This is nonsense and a lie.
[01:52:57.852 --> 01:53:01.873]  But Louis Farrakhan and Keith Ellison, they actually are anti-Semites.
[01:53:02.533 --> 01:53:07.797]  Louis Farrakhan gave a speech where he said, Keith Ellison was a member of us in the Nation of Islam.
[01:53:07.817 --> 01:53:08.797]  This is his speech.
[01:53:08.957 --> 01:53:11.339]  This isn't Alex and me conspiracy theory.
[01:53:11.359 --> 01:53:12.560]  This is actually real life.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:19.324]  And Farrakhan had said, if you want the door open, you got to wait for a Jew to open it for you.
[01:53:19.344 --> 01:53:21.926]  This is Louis Farrakhan, not me, not Alex.
[01:53:22.266 --> 01:53:26.969]  Keith Ellison, nevertheless, holds up the Antifa handbook, supports domestic terrorism.
[01:53:27.309 --> 01:53:28.830]  He supports anti-Semitism.
[01:53:29.250 --> 01:53:35.195]  So the people who hate the Jewish people are not us, they're not real Americans because we tolerate everybody.
[01:53:35.315 --> 01:53:46.725]  I was about to say, have you seen the Young Turks saying that I'm anti-Semitic for saying George Soros was a Nazi collaborator and that because I said Brian Stelter has a crazy looking smile, I'm anti-Semitic and I said he was a Jew?
[01:53:46.805 --> 01:53:47.706]  I never said any of that.
[01:53:48.286 --> 01:53:50.748]  The level of crazy lying is just insane.
[01:53:51.248 --> 01:53:52.810]  How much can they turn it up from here?
[01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:53.590]  I think you're right.
[01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:55.052]  I think it's just, they want to kill us.
[01:53:56.397 --> 01:54:01.948]  Yeah, well, that's the issue is they want to lie about us without us being able to tell the truth.
[01:54:02.489 --> 01:54:04.693]  And the Young Turks, their engagement is terrible.
[01:54:04.713 --> 01:54:06.397]  They don't get views like they used to.
[01:54:06.697 --> 01:54:08.341]  And by the way, we should ask Google.
[01:54:09.349 --> 01:54:11.070]  Why do you promote Sink?
[01:54:11.190 --> 01:54:15.851]  Have you read what Sink and his partner wrote about 14-year-old girls?
[01:54:15.871 --> 01:54:21.433]  They said women are subhuman and genetically mutants and because they don't all want to have sex with him.
[01:54:21.473 --> 01:54:24.435]  And then he talked about young 15-year-old girls in the house.
[01:54:24.675 --> 01:54:25.715]  I'm not going to say what he said.
[01:54:26.155 --> 01:54:31.097]  Well, what do you expect from... you know, this Islamist didn't fall too far from the tree.
[01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:42.414]  Yeah, so we should ask you two, why is it that you promote most heavily somebody who referred to 15-year-old girls as, again, I can't say it but... Don't say it or they'll say we're bullying.
[01:54:44.218 --> 01:54:46.619]  Yeah, that's what they said, though.
[01:54:46.659 --> 01:54:48.639]  No, no, we quote them and then we get banned.
[01:54:48.659 --> 01:54:49.779]  I mean, this is the level we're at.
[01:54:49.859 --> 01:54:51.320]  And Mike, you're a lawyer, though.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:51.880]  Don't you agree?
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.320]  I've talked to top lawyers and they say, no, you've got the suit now.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:55.601]  That's why YouTube's backed off.
[01:54:56.121 --> 01:54:57.121]  Because they know we're not playing games.
[01:54:57.161 --> 01:55:01.842]  We have them all the whole chain saying they're censoring, saying it's for political, laughing about it.
[01:55:02.962 --> 01:55:04.963]  And now they're backing off, at least on me.
[01:55:05.003 --> 01:55:06.103]  They should back off on you and others.
[01:55:06.263 --> 01:55:07.183]  But that's because we fought back.
[01:55:07.604 --> 01:55:09.364]  As a lawyer, is this not tortious interference?
[01:55:10.714 --> 01:55:12.096]  Well, it's antitrust.
[01:55:12.296 --> 01:55:13.217]  There's a number of things.
[01:55:13.317 --> 01:55:17.263]  If you want... Facebook and Google control 88% of the advertising market.
[01:55:17.283 --> 01:55:19.386]  That's their big weakness is the antitrust, exactly.
[01:55:19.426 --> 01:55:23.511]  But what I mean is CNN admitting that they're involved with YouTube trying to shut me down.
[01:55:23.571 --> 01:55:26.475]  Another company involved with a third party trying to shut someone down.
[01:55:26.735 --> 01:55:27.837]  Is that not tortious interference?
[01:55:28.749 --> 01:55:31.372]  That's definitely unfair business practices for sure.
[01:55:31.412 --> 01:55:33.535]  It's conspiring against you.
[01:55:33.655 --> 01:55:35.978]  So yeah, there are major losses to be had.
[01:55:36.479 --> 01:55:40.765]  That said, the number one priority is to get us banned.
[01:55:40.785 --> 01:55:42.587]  They want to do it while you fall asleep, right?
[01:55:42.887 --> 01:55:44.650]  You fall asleep, you wake up, you're banned.
[01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:45.891]  Oh, we can't do anything about it.
[01:55:45.911 --> 01:55:46.652]  That's how it always is.
[01:55:48.009 --> 01:55:53.553]  Then they want to take all the Christians and round up all the Christians just like Facebook is now having snow.
[01:55:53.693 --> 01:55:57.535]  Facebook is now putting Christians in ghettos, just like Matt Drudge predicted.
[01:55:57.596 --> 01:55:59.617]  I can't believe, how did Drudge predict all this?
[01:56:00.854 --> 01:56:01.655]  Well, he knew.
[01:56:01.915 --> 01:56:02.836]  I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:56:02.996 --> 01:56:04.297]  I did not like politics.
[01:56:04.417 --> 01:56:08.760]  All I ever cared about was going to the gym, lifting weights, and doing my Gorilla Mindset stuff.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:14.685]  And then I read a book on the Cambodian genocide, which the media never talks about because it was left wing.
[01:56:15.485 --> 01:56:17.607]  And I thought... Zbigniew Brzezinski supported it.
[01:56:18.601 --> 01:56:21.583]  Yes, I saw the parallels between the killing fields.
[01:56:21.924 --> 01:56:23.425]  What was happening in Cambodia?
[01:56:24.025 --> 01:56:26.127]  That is the path that we're on today.
[01:56:26.147 --> 01:56:28.408]  And when I read that book, I actually cried.
[01:56:28.468 --> 01:56:33.072]  I remember I was traveling through Cambodia and learning about the people and the culture.
[01:56:33.672 --> 01:56:36.995]  I read the book, Survival in the Killing Fields, and I was crying and I realized
[01:56:37.555 --> 01:56:45.380]  I have to get involved because if I don't, if you were in Cambodia, you just thought, well, you know, I'm just a middle class person or I'm just a regular person.
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:46.821]  I'm going to sit this one out.
[01:56:46.841 --> 01:56:49.542]  If you knew how to write, if you had glasses, you were dead.
[01:56:50.883 --> 01:56:51.083]  Yeah.
[01:56:51.424 --> 01:56:57.067]  So now if you're, if you are a Christian, they're going to put you in, the killing fields are coming.
[01:56:57.327 --> 01:57:03.431]  That's all I can say is that anybody who studied history knows that the only reason you want to censor and disarm people
[01:57:04.165 --> 01:57:08.810]  It's so that they are powerless and helpless and you can take them away into the night and put them in the gulags.
[01:57:08.971 --> 01:57:10.152]  Yes, it's a formula.
[01:57:10.292 --> 01:57:12.134]  Every time they're following an exact plan.
[01:57:12.254 --> 01:57:13.556]  Europe's about two years ahead of us.
[01:57:14.096 --> 01:57:14.677]  Mike, you're right.
[01:57:14.917 --> 01:57:15.918]  You're not just saying this.
[01:57:16.159 --> 01:57:17.420]  They're following an exact plan.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:19.763]  So I'm going to come back and talk about the Google protest.
[01:57:19.943 --> 01:57:20.884]  People need to be ready for this.
[01:57:20.924 --> 01:57:21.805]  We're not announcing it yet.
[01:57:22.205 --> 01:57:25.049]  And then other solutions with Mike Cernovich from Guerrilla Mindset.
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:29.482]  Absolutely essential, people, that you realize this is happening.
[01:57:29.862 --> 01:57:33.325]  And that's the reason we've got patriots in government that are more and more working with us.
[01:57:34.065 --> 01:57:36.667]  Because they understand that, wow, you conspiracy theorists were right.
[01:57:37.047 --> 01:57:38.408]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[01:57:38.448 --> 01:57:38.789]  You bet.
[01:57:39.249 --> 01:57:41.410]  So let's all get together and let's stop this.
[01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:42.191]  Let's come together.
[01:57:42.231 --> 01:57:42.931]  We can do it.
[01:57:43.512 --> 01:57:44.152]  I can feel it.
[01:57:44.192 --> 01:57:45.213]  I can feel it right now.
[01:57:45.713 --> 01:57:47.795]  I know the spirit of liberty is rising.
[01:57:48.115 --> 01:57:49.656]  That's why the enemy is panicking.
[01:57:49.716 --> 01:57:50.797]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:52.896 --> 01:58:01.761]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:58:02.961 --> 01:58:04.762]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:58:04.822 --> 01:58:11.926]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:58:12.346 --> 01:58:18.149]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:58:18.829 --> 01:58:20.130]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:39.802]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:58:40.883 --> 01:58:45.025]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:58:45.325 --> 01:58:50.607]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[01:58:51.007 --> 01:58:52.067]  As above, so below.
[01:58:52.628 --> 01:58:55.749]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the mass scale.
[01:58:56.349 --> 01:58:57.430]  Most tiny of scales.
[01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:59.031]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:58:59.451 --> 01:59:00.932]  America is building its wall.
[01:59:01.333 --> 01:59:01.813]  Will it work?
[01:59:01.933 --> 01:59:02.473]  We don't know.
[01:59:02.934 --> 01:59:03.534]  Is Trump right?
[01:59:04.215 --> 01:59:06.336]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:59:06.836 --> 01:59:12.800]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[01:59:13.181 --> 01:59:19.065]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:59:19.805 --> 01:59:26.090]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:59:26.851 --> 01:59:29.393]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[01:59:29.453 --> 01:59:35.878]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:59:42.523 --> 01:59:44.905]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[01:59:45.546 --> 01:59:48.789]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:52.872]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:59.698]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:25.726 --> 02:00:30.830]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:33.712]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.495 --> 02:00:40.517]  They say that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[02:00:41.477 --> 02:00:43.239]  I am a novice historian.
[02:00:43.439 --> 02:00:44.259]  I've read 800 books.
[02:00:47.276 --> 02:00:51.340]  On history, I probably listened to another 100 or 200 or more actually.
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:54.622]  I think about on the treadmill or... I need to start doing that again.
[02:00:54.642 --> 02:01:02.289]  That's what I used to do, is get on the treadmill or whatever and listen to historical, you know, uh... screeds while I was exercising.
[02:01:02.309 --> 02:01:07.654]  I'll admit, the last 7, 8, 9 years I've been so busy, I... I don't read history anymore, but I have that body of knowledge.
[02:01:09.315 --> 02:01:09.435]  And...
[02:01:10.492 --> 02:01:24.586]  There's no doubt that we've got an authoritarian system, and now that they're getting it in place, they're hyping up the left as the chosen instrument worldwide to bully and attack and kill everybody else.
[02:01:26.168 --> 02:01:27.089]  Mike Cernovich is back.
[02:01:28.803 --> 02:01:32.705]  I guess he thought that was a longer break, because I know the end of the hour is only two minutes, not four like the others, but Mike is back.
[02:01:33.345 --> 02:01:35.827]  And I just wanted to, he's got the idea, and I agree, we need to get on the street.
[02:01:36.347 --> 02:01:49.014]  And that just means you with a sandwich board out there, or a bumper sticker, or whatever it is, but we need to have some big demonstrations, kind of like flash mobs, I don't want to use that term, flash liberty, peacefully, and just say, you know, everybody be waiting.
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:51.841]  Maybe have an email list or something like that.
[02:01:52.381 --> 02:01:53.081]  You know, that's what we'll do.
[02:01:53.141 --> 02:01:54.722]  Go sign up at Infowars.com.
[02:01:55.562 --> 02:01:56.583]  Infowars.com.
[02:01:56.603 --> 02:01:58.183]  A forward slash newsletter.
[02:01:58.863 --> 02:02:02.105]  And we should create a new email for people that want that.
[02:02:02.904 --> 02:02:04.945]  See, we had an app that had some issues.
[02:02:04.965 --> 02:02:07.447]  We're launching a new one that's even better, that's going to have live alerts.
[02:02:07.647 --> 02:02:08.387]  That's really the answer.
[02:02:08.447 --> 02:02:09.368]  Everybody needs to get the apps.
[02:02:10.568 --> 02:02:11.449]  And Mike, we need to meet.
[02:02:11.469 --> 02:02:16.292]  I know you've been wanting to meet and talk, and then we've both been busy, but let's just talk about the war games.
[02:02:16.312 --> 02:02:20.894]  People kind of get the idea of what's coming, because we have to really, really protest Facebook, Twitter, Google.
[02:02:21.114 --> 02:02:25.397]  We've got to let them know, and we've got to piss in their Cheerios coming up at South by Southwest.
[02:02:26.499 --> 02:02:28.101]  Yeah, this is our last stand.
[02:02:28.181 --> 02:02:30.823]  If we don't succeed, it's just over.
[02:02:30.844 --> 02:02:31.744]  That's what I tell people.
[02:02:31.905 --> 02:02:33.306]  If you like me, thanks.
[02:02:33.406 --> 02:02:34.267]  Been good to know you.
[02:02:34.888 --> 02:02:35.408]  It's over.
[02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:36.149]  It's done.
[02:02:36.209 --> 02:02:37.590]  Free speech is over in America.
[02:02:38.031 --> 02:02:41.775]  If you're a Christian and you think you can just go to church and they're going to leave you alone, you're wrong.
[02:02:41.795 --> 02:02:42.596]  They're coming for you.
[02:02:42.856 --> 02:02:47.501]  They're coming for you harder than me because the Christians are the biggest
[02:02:47.841 --> 02:02:48.121]  So, it's over.
[02:02:48.141 --> 02:02:53.984]  If we don't take legally and lawfully, if we don't have conversations, because notice you and I don't ever try to censor people.
[02:03:08.163 --> 02:03:10.685]  We don't try to say, why won't you do it?
[02:03:10.705 --> 02:03:11.625]  I can't even do it.
[02:03:11.725 --> 02:03:15.568]  I can't even file a complaint on CNN and play their own game for bullying.
[02:03:15.648 --> 02:03:17.409]  I just can't do it.
[02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:18.610]  It's too cowardly.
[02:03:19.610 --> 02:03:21.432]  Well, look what CNN did to that grandma.
[02:03:21.992 --> 02:03:29.757]  Could you imagine if you or I went to an elderly Hillary Clinton's house and said, did you know that you were involved in Russian activity?
[02:03:29.997 --> 02:03:31.078]  People would crucify us.
[02:03:31.758 --> 02:03:32.499]  It would be over.
[02:03:32.519 --> 02:03:34.180]  They would say, look at these monsters.
[02:03:34.835 --> 02:03:38.718]  But meanwhile, CNN, and here's why I don't like these people, they're gutless.
[02:03:39.058 --> 02:03:40.880]  Why don't you go to Clapper's house?
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:44.923]  Why don't you go to Deep State's house and address them and confront them?
[02:03:45.163 --> 02:03:48.265]  Why don't you go to Michael Moore, CNN, if you're so tough?
[02:03:48.526 --> 02:03:51.548]  Michael Moore attended an anti-Trump protest in New York.
[02:03:51.848 --> 02:03:52.989]  They just want to bully grandma.
[02:03:53.009 --> 02:03:53.850]  That is funded by Russia.
[02:03:54.795 --> 02:03:56.518]  Yeah, they just want to bully Nana.
[02:03:56.838 --> 02:03:58.060]  That's all they want to do.
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:03:59.462]  They're not, they have no integrity.
[02:03:59.722 --> 02:04:00.904]  That's why they want to go after you.
[02:04:00.924 --> 02:04:02.146]  But what they did is bully.
[02:04:02.587 --> 02:04:03.668]  They should be banned.
[02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:06.793]  If the rules were applied equally, they would, their channel would be banned.
[02:04:06.813 --> 02:04:07.774]  Yeah, this is real bullying.
[02:04:07.874 --> 02:04:08.716]  This is real bullying.
[02:04:09.704 --> 02:04:10.485]  Yeah, we don't do that.
[02:04:10.685 --> 02:04:11.365]  Go up to Nana.
[02:04:11.605 --> 02:04:14.067]  Hey, Nana, did you know you voted for Hillary Clinton?
[02:04:14.268 --> 02:04:17.270]  Hey, Nana, did you know that you spread a meme from Russia?
[02:04:17.670 --> 02:04:18.291]  Terrific!
[02:04:18.551 --> 02:04:22.794]  I don't know how even Glenn Greenwald and liberal people were like, I'm appalled.
[02:04:22.814 --> 02:04:24.876]  This is nauseating what they're doing.
[02:04:24.996 --> 02:04:25.616]  Oh, tough guy.
[02:04:25.896 --> 02:04:26.637]  Big tough, Drew.
[02:04:26.677 --> 02:04:27.338]  You're so tough.
[02:04:27.558 --> 02:04:28.779]  Why don't you come confront me?
[02:04:28.839 --> 02:04:29.779]  Why don't you confront Alex?
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:31.301]  Why don't you confront Clapper?
[02:04:31.581 --> 02:04:34.123]  Why don't you confront somebody other than somebody's grandma?
[02:04:34.767 --> 02:04:35.467]  They won't do it.
[02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:39.730]  So that is why, South by Southwest, I will be in Austin, Texas, Alex.
[02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:40.791]  We have to meet.
[02:04:40.931 --> 02:04:41.971]  Let's do a few more minutes.
[02:04:41.991 --> 02:04:43.352]  Let's do a few more minutes, and we got our next guest.
[02:04:43.372 --> 02:04:44.052]  I want to talk about that.
[02:04:44.453 --> 02:04:45.994]  And people, this is it.
[02:04:46.054 --> 02:04:46.394]  It's right.
[02:04:46.414 --> 02:04:49.656]  That's why they're so care of demonstrations, because they know that's where they can't shut us down.
[02:04:49.916 --> 02:04:52.698]  And they don't want this to start a chain reaction to Southern censorship.
[02:04:52.718 --> 02:04:56.400]  That's why they backed off on us for now, because they realize we got the momentum.
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:57.560]  We have the initiative.
[02:04:57.941 --> 02:04:59.181]  Now is the time to strike.
[02:04:59.522 --> 02:04:59.922]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.537 --> 02:05:08.280]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:14.084]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[02:05:14.184 --> 02:05:19.427]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there.
[02:05:19.487 --> 02:05:23.229]  We're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[02:05:23.409 --> 02:05:31.154]  So go to fortifiedsupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[02:05:31.314 --> 02:05:33.376]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.
[02:05:33.976 --> 02:05:41.203]  Introducing Icarim, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse exclusively available at infowarslife.com.
[02:05:41.683 --> 02:05:50.851]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[02:05:51.111 --> 02:05:55.175]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful
[02:05:55.815 --> 02:05:58.276]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:05:58.316 --> 02:06:00.057]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:06:24.170 --> 02:06:28.332]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:29.052 --> 02:06:34.854]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:36.075 --> 02:06:39.396]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:39.416 --> 02:06:43.378]  A few more minutes with Mike Cernovich of Gorilla Mindset and Gorilla Media.
[02:06:44.471 --> 02:06:46.192]  He's on fire today and he's so right.
[02:06:46.913 --> 02:06:57.801]  We get conditioned with the censorship and now the attack on journalism and this concerted Twitter, Facebook, YouTube ban that is, I don't know, I want to say it's about 50 times bigger than anything else we've ever seen.
[02:06:58.121 --> 02:07:01.343]  They've been trying bans and trying spin and trying all this.
[02:07:01.784 --> 02:07:04.065]  This is exponentially bigger than anything I've ever seen.
[02:07:04.085 --> 02:07:05.686]  I want to see if Mike agrees with that.
[02:07:06.807 --> 02:07:08.229]  They are banning Christians.
[02:07:08.249 --> 02:07:09.330]  They are banning Libertarians.
[02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:10.671]  They're persecuting them everywhere.
[02:07:11.212 --> 02:07:14.916]  Facebook's kicking thousands of pro-gun and Christian channels off.
[02:07:14.976 --> 02:07:17.658]  PragerU is in a giant lawsuit.
[02:07:18.239 --> 02:07:20.401]  It's very milquetoast, very professional.
[02:07:21.262 --> 02:07:25.566]  And then they block it all and Snopes comes in and says, you know, we question this.
[02:07:26.906 --> 02:07:28.388]  This is such discrimination.
[02:07:28.908 --> 02:07:43.282]  I mean, imagine if people were putting, like, on a gay YouTube website, you know, about, say, you know, gay lifestyles or something, and there were, like, conservative Christian markers saying, we dispute this, we're the fact-checkers, you're all going to hell.
[02:07:43.763 --> 02:07:45.284]  The left has their religion.
[02:07:45.965 --> 02:07:48.848]  And it's controlling everybody's life, and now they're doing it.
[02:07:48.888 --> 02:07:50.570]  They're saying, hashtag, hunt Republicans.
[02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:53.913]  You know, billboards, kill the NRA, kill people.
[02:07:54.553 --> 02:07:56.856]  Burn Dana Loews, kill her, she's a murderer.
[02:07:57.156 --> 02:07:58.297]  Witch, witch, witch, she's a witch.
[02:07:58.317 --> 02:07:58.958]  How do we know she's a witch?
[02:07:59.258 --> 02:08:02.041]  Well, if she sinks and drowns, she's not a witch.
[02:08:02.061 --> 02:08:02.962]  But if she floats, she is a witch.
[02:08:03.002 --> 02:08:08.968]  I mean, it's so medieval to see people degenerate back into, like, varlets.
[02:08:09.488 --> 02:08:10.949]  Well, they're just like, we'll kill them all!
[02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:11.610]  Yeah!
[02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:13.432]  We want communism so good!
[02:08:13.592 --> 02:08:15.274]  We'll buy smartphones and buy everything!
[02:08:15.374 --> 02:08:19.658]  And you're like, well go to Venezuela where they're eating out of trash cans for five years.
[02:08:20.018 --> 02:08:21.980]  And like they have thousands a week dying of starvation.
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:22.761]  Shut up!
[02:08:23.101 --> 02:08:23.802]  You don't know!
[02:08:24.062 --> 02:08:24.943]  It's a wonderful thing!
[02:08:24.963 --> 02:08:25.944]  We're gonna do it!
[02:08:26.164 --> 02:08:26.404]  Witch!
[02:08:26.525 --> 02:08:26.765]  Witch!
[02:08:26.905 --> 02:08:30.248]  In fact, let's play a second of this and then go back to Mike Cernovich about how we need to take action.
[02:08:30.288 --> 02:08:30.749]  Here it is.
[02:08:31.269 --> 02:08:32.190]  Let's play a clip of Witch Wish.
[02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.911]  Do we have it ready?
[02:08:35.123 --> 02:08:36.704]  Okay, well cue it up later and we'll get it.
[02:08:36.724 --> 02:08:39.266]  I want to hook all those computers up to sound if we can do that, that'd be great.
[02:08:39.647 --> 02:08:40.588]  Anyways, which which.
[02:08:41.228 --> 02:08:41.648]  Seriously.
[02:08:42.594 --> 02:08:43.615]  They've gone crazy.
[02:08:43.675 --> 02:08:51.500]  I know there's elites behind them and money, but it's like an 89-year-old crazy Nazi collaborator, where they think they can go on CNN, ABC News.
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:53.342]  They've obviously put a PR funding out.
[02:08:53.562 --> 02:08:58.465]  He funds Sync Uyghur, who's got the name of a Christian genocide organization.
[02:08:58.866 --> 02:09:02.448]  Just what you're pointing out, the Young Turks killed a million and a half Christians.
[02:09:02.468 --> 02:09:06.891]  That's the biggest genocide outside Russia, and Poland, and we've ever seen in Ukraine.
[02:09:07.151 --> 02:09:10.114]  So it's the fourth biggest Christian genocide in modern history.
[02:09:11.018 --> 02:09:12.159]  Fourth biggest, I guess, in history.
[02:09:12.519 --> 02:09:14.500]  You know, a million and five, that's not chopped liver.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:18.462]  Dead people, children, you name it, you know, pregnant women run through.
[02:09:19.082 --> 02:09:25.385]  And then he's saying, I don't know if you saw the clip, that I'm the worst person in the world, that George Soros is a Holocaust survivor.
[02:09:25.625 --> 02:09:31.408]  Again, Mike, the magnitude of them defending this, they think they'll get away with it.
[02:09:31.768 --> 02:09:33.889]  What type of slimy creature is this?
[02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:41.414]  Well, they know that if they get rid of us, they can engage in a genocide here in America.
[02:09:41.454 --> 02:09:46.096]  The young Turks are fighting at the bit to destroy Christians here.
[02:09:46.136 --> 02:09:47.157]  So that's the whole game.
[02:09:47.377 --> 02:09:48.998]  And by the way, they're going after Jews, too.
[02:09:49.458 --> 02:09:55.022]  There's a lot of drama on Twitter right now from people who have called us falsely anti-Semites.
[02:09:55.042 --> 02:09:58.564]  Just for the record, I disavow any bigotry, hatred.
[02:09:58.664 --> 02:09:59.965]  They all know that, though.
[02:10:00.836 --> 02:10:01.677]  Right.
[02:10:01.738 --> 02:10:08.468]  They all know, and they're all liars, and they are coming for the Jewish people, and they're finally realizing that now.
[02:10:08.529 --> 02:10:10.051]  I see on Twitter people from Tallahassee.
[02:10:10.071 --> 02:10:14.638]  I am seeing a lot of even liberal Jews are waking up going, you're right, I see it, I apologize.
[02:10:14.678 --> 02:10:15.440]  I'm getting a lot of that.
[02:10:16.431 --> 02:10:24.656]  Yeah, so they're actually freaking out a little bit because they realize people like me and you, I don't sit around all day thinking about Jewish issues.
[02:10:24.696 --> 02:10:26.017]  I don't really, it's not relevant.
[02:10:26.037 --> 02:10:29.639]  I don't even ever ask myself what somebody is if they're interesting and cool.
[02:10:29.659 --> 02:10:33.502]  I don't even like, I'm not obsessed with race or religion.
[02:10:33.522 --> 02:10:34.462]  Well that's what's funny.
[02:10:34.722 --> 02:10:39.846]  They'll call me an anti-Semite for making fun of somebody and I go, what are you talking, I didn't even know the guy was Jewish.
[02:10:39.986 --> 02:10:41.567]  I just knew the guy was an idiot, you know.
[02:10:41.587 --> 02:10:43.508]  I'm not talking about this at all.
[02:10:43.908 --> 02:10:45.668]  Well, I make fun of Sink for how he looks.
[02:10:45.728 --> 02:10:47.689]  I'm not bashing Turks in general.
[02:10:47.729 --> 02:10:48.749]  And it's the same thing with Stelter.
[02:10:49.029 --> 02:10:50.570]  He said, I said Stelter's a Jew.
[02:10:50.610 --> 02:10:51.250]  I've already said this.
[02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:52.410]  And I didn't.
[02:10:52.510 --> 02:10:55.411]  And then he just lies and says I attacked him because he's Jewish.
[02:10:55.651 --> 02:10:56.911]  And then he says, but he's not Jewish.
[02:10:57.151 --> 02:11:00.712]  He just makes up all these things I'm wrong about that aren't demonstrably false.
[02:11:00.992 --> 02:11:02.213]  Show the video, Sink!
[02:11:02.573 --> 02:11:02.993]  He doesn't.
[02:11:03.991 --> 02:11:20.226]  But, and what they're doing, so the funny thing is, they want to get people like us out of the way, because they know that we would stand with any oppressed Jewish minority, and they know if they get us out of the way, then they can go and they, the Jews are going to be in the concentration camps with the Christians too, if the left has a way.
[02:11:20.427 --> 02:11:22.569]  Just go read what Louis Farrakhan has to say!
[02:11:22.829 --> 02:11:23.850]  They're public!
[02:11:24.250 --> 02:11:28.935]  Well, expanding off of that, mainline leftists teach that
[02:11:30.171 --> 02:11:36.536]  Teach that Jews are bad, and that George Soros says that Israel needs to be given over to the Muslims.
[02:11:36.896 --> 02:11:42.180]  So that's a fact, and then the Jewish movements in America are led by George Soros, a Nazi collaborator.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:44.302]  What fruitcake planet did we wake up on?
[02:11:45.598 --> 02:11:47.380]  Well, that was the problem.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:52.924]  A lot of people were brainwashed into thinking that we're throwing dog whistles or whatever, which we're not.
[02:11:53.325 --> 02:11:59.810]  But meanwhile, Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam overtly say that Jews are satanic.
[02:11:59.850 --> 02:12:00.791]  This is what they say.
[02:12:00.871 --> 02:12:01.351]  Not me.
[02:12:02.012 --> 02:12:02.452]  Not me.
[02:12:02.572 --> 02:12:03.053]  Not you.
[02:12:03.093 --> 02:12:04.614]  We would never say that because we don't believe it.
[02:12:05.014 --> 02:12:05.915]  So that's what's going on.
[02:12:06.115 --> 02:12:06.816]  But that's why.
[02:12:07.862 --> 02:12:15.210]  We have, maybe we need to set up a separate website or something, but those of you, especially if you're in Austin, Texas, I'm going to be in town.
[02:12:15.230 --> 02:12:23.519]  I don't want to travel, but I realize, I'm so burned out by traveling Alex, but I realize this is life or death, and this is our last stand.
[02:12:23.579 --> 02:12:25.041]  If they destroy us here, we're dead.
[02:12:26.001 --> 02:12:36.066]  Yeah, let's go ahead and pick the date that we're going to, or a few days when we're going to do it, so people can get here, they can be in place, they can be ready, and then we'll announce live on air, hey, two hours this.
[02:12:36.987 --> 02:12:38.167]  So when is South by Southwest?
[02:12:38.207 --> 02:12:38.968]  I try to avoid it.
[02:12:39.888 --> 02:12:40.268]  When is that?
[02:12:40.288 --> 02:12:44.230]  It's like March 9th through the 14th, I think, something like that.
[02:12:44.250 --> 02:12:45.151]  Okay, okay, so...
[02:12:46.175 --> 02:12:47.395]  Yeah, oh my god.
[02:12:47.716 --> 02:12:50.997]  It's like a plague that sends all these zombies trying to get a job that doesn't exist.
[02:12:51.017 --> 02:12:53.478]  It's a giant pump-and-dump to rip people off, in my view.
[02:12:54.498 --> 02:12:55.078]  It's incredible.
[02:12:55.679 --> 02:12:57.539]  So, yeah, we'll set something up.
[02:12:57.579 --> 02:13:01.181]  Let's start talking today, and then let's start announcing something by Monday, okay?
[02:13:02.509 --> 02:13:04.872]  Yeah, we need a dedicated event.
[02:13:04.912 --> 02:13:07.996]  We need a squad leader, team leader, activism.
[02:13:08.156 --> 02:13:10.660]  If we don't do activism now, we're all done.
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:11.361]  We're all dead.
[02:13:11.581 --> 02:13:12.762]  And I don't mean figuratively.
[02:13:13.263 --> 02:13:20.533]  We're at the point now where if I just said, you know what, I just want to retire and leave me alone, then they would say, oh, now you look weak.
[02:13:21.233 --> 02:13:29.896]  I was about to say, I want to turn the tide completely, because I'll still have info wars, but I don't want to like, just be like, pedal to the metal constantly.
[02:13:29.916 --> 02:13:32.197]  It has a physical effect, it has a mental effect.
[02:13:32.817 --> 02:13:35.038]  You know, your children grow up, and it's, I agree.
[02:13:36.038 --> 02:13:37.679]  I mean, I am just so sick of this.
[02:13:37.859 --> 02:13:38.659]  But they're not going to stop.
[02:13:38.679 --> 02:13:40.220]  They're forcing us to get even stronger.
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:42.020]  God bless you, Mike Cernovich.
[02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:48.923]  Let's talk, let's get you set up for like Monday or something on the show to come on and let's talk about this, but let's war game this over the weekend, okay?
[02:13:49.804 --> 02:13:50.125]  Perfect.
[02:13:50.465 --> 02:13:51.126]  Alright, thanks buddy.
[02:13:51.146 --> 02:13:51.968]  You can just honcho that.
[02:13:51.988 --> 02:13:52.909]  You always have great plans.
[02:13:53.290 --> 02:13:55.373]  So you just tell me what you think we ought to do and we'll just do it.
[02:13:56.343 --> 02:13:58.224]  Great to have generals out there like Mike Cernovich.
[02:13:58.244 --> 02:14:06.911]  Just briefly, we're going to come back with this next guest from the Second Amendment, who's in Florida and has found out about some potential triggers for another mass shooting that may not be averted by a sheriff.
[02:14:06.931 --> 02:14:08.052]  He's working on the case right now.
[02:14:08.913 --> 02:14:10.694]  He is from the Central Florida Post.
[02:14:10.714 --> 02:14:11.775]  You saw him on CNN.
[02:14:12.275 --> 02:14:13.897]  They were trying to demonize him, trying to talk.
[02:14:14.217 --> 02:14:15.558]  We'll play that clip as well when we come back.
[02:14:15.818 --> 02:14:20.182]  I also wanted to open the phones up today, but they've loaded me up with so many great guests with so much breaking intel.
[02:14:20.822 --> 02:14:22.323]  But we're gonna be taking more calls on the show.
[02:14:22.364 --> 02:14:23.024]  I love your calls.
[02:14:23.104 --> 02:14:25.086]  It's great during the 34-hour broadcast.
[02:14:25.126 --> 02:14:26.407]  We've had a lot of chance to take those.
[02:14:26.467 --> 02:14:29.410]  I came in last night, did it about two hours, took about 20 phone calls.
[02:14:29.831 --> 02:14:30.691]  So we're gonna be doing a lot of that.
[02:14:32.133 --> 02:14:33.454]  This is serious, okay?
[02:14:34.755 --> 02:14:35.496]  Everybody sees it.
[02:14:35.616 --> 02:14:41.722]  It's just like, for what you see, there's 80% more going on behind the scenes you don't know.
[02:14:41.782 --> 02:14:43.764]  And I'm, quite frankly, very honored.
[02:14:45.005 --> 02:14:45.666]  Very honored.
[02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:47.892]  Uh, that they pulled out all the stops.
[02:14:48.052 --> 02:14:51.855]  And I know that they may go ahead and pull the trigger and, you know, deep six me.
[02:14:52.256 --> 02:14:52.796]  But you know what?
[02:14:52.996 --> 02:14:53.997]  My forebears did that.
[02:14:54.478 --> 02:14:57.380]  And everybody else, I, as a man, it's like, I'm instinctive.
[02:14:57.420 --> 02:14:58.561]  It feels like where I'm supposed to be.
[02:14:59.262 --> 02:15:00.863]  I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
[02:15:00.883 --> 02:15:05.346]  I don't have any fear of dying or being put in prison or being killed or being attacked or anything.
[02:15:05.707 --> 02:15:12.072]  I just have fear that I haven't completed the mission and that you're not realizing how important you are and not active enough and not aggressive enough.
[02:15:12.092 --> 02:15:12.933]  And I'm not bitching at you.
[02:15:13.493 --> 02:15:15.074]  I'm just saying, do whatever you got to do.
[02:15:15.114 --> 02:15:17.636]  Go to city council, call the talk radio, write a book.
[02:15:18.196 --> 02:15:19.717]  All of us together, we're going to defeat this.
[02:15:20.118 --> 02:15:22.760]  Especially the young people, but also powerful individuals.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:28.483]  Whether you're a pastor, or a professor, or a teacher, or a shop teacher.
[02:15:29.324 --> 02:15:30.085]  Everybody's powerful.
[02:15:30.545 --> 02:15:36.609]  And people that have money are really powerful because you can buy products that you need and use and help support the truth.
[02:15:36.649 --> 02:15:37.290]  You can donate.
[02:15:37.730 --> 02:15:40.092]  Infowars.com forward slash show has a donate button.
[02:15:40.112 --> 02:15:41.793]  I want to thank those that have donated.
[02:15:42.293 --> 02:15:43.554]  We have free shipping store-wide.
[02:15:43.574 --> 02:15:46.296]  A lot of great products.
[02:15:46.336 --> 02:15:48.958]  Our top supplements are all 30 to 50% off.
[02:15:48.998 --> 02:15:49.958]  Some are 80% off.
[02:15:50.038 --> 02:15:51.299]  It's beyond lost liters.
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.740]  So I want you to see how great they are.
[02:15:53.101 --> 02:15:54.922]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:15:54.942 --> 02:15:55.322]  Stay with us.
[02:16:04.413 --> 02:16:06.795]  Our latest product, by the way, is Immunewald.
[02:16:06.816 --> 02:16:09.658]  It's very, very affordable at $29.95.
[02:16:09.878 --> 02:16:12.100]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[02:16:12.621 --> 02:16:18.746]  And we set out with beta glucans, olive leaf, and a bunch of other key compounds that are absolutely documented.
[02:16:18.766 --> 02:16:23.130]  We can even make claims about what this does to
[02:16:23.991 --> 02:16:29.978]  Bolster your immune system and make you healthier, especially if you're gonna be traveling or you're under stress or it's in the winter months.
[02:16:30.559 --> 02:16:32.801]  This is something everybody should be taking.
[02:16:32.861 --> 02:16:37.807]  Wellmune is patented and documented in all the hundreds of studies.
[02:16:38.848 --> 02:16:40.809]  And then you got the ancient stuff there as well.
[02:16:40.849 --> 02:16:45.531]  The organic olive leaf extract is what the Roman soldiers would take whenever they started getting sick.
[02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:49.352]  Just chopped full of all those key enzymes and vitamin C and so much more.
[02:16:49.372 --> 02:16:55.875]  Then it's got all the concentrated highest quality organic types of mushrooms that are documented for your body.
[02:16:55.915 --> 02:17:01.257]  And then concentrated citrus peel, orange peel, lemon peel, organic orange peel.
[02:17:02.758 --> 02:17:05.919]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not going to sit here and hype this product up.
[02:17:07.082 --> 02:17:09.863]  So whether it's the sleep aid knockout you need, which is amazing.
[02:17:10.023 --> 02:17:13.004]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle.
[02:17:13.084 --> 02:17:14.464]  And a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:17:14.804 --> 02:17:19.146]  And I said, I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much are you in that?
[02:17:19.746 --> 02:17:26.088]  They said on average about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:49.750]  And I said, so, I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and several other things, and I checked with scientists, none of them interact badly, they're all from nature, they're all healthy, they all have good, you know, good clean records, and then you get a sleep unlike other systems.
[02:17:51.112 --> 02:17:57.276]  Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:17:57.296 --> 02:17:59.177]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:17:59.197 --> 02:18:01.038]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:18:01.058 --> 02:18:03.940]  You know, doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink.
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:06.742]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:18:07.282 --> 02:18:08.883]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:18:08.903 --> 02:18:10.905]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:18:12.119 --> 02:18:15.263]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:18:15.283 --> 02:18:16.164]  This is insane.
[02:18:16.585 --> 02:18:17.546]  Wow, it's incredible.
[02:18:17.566 --> 02:18:19.608]  I've taken melatonin stuff by itself and it didn't help.
[02:18:20.129 --> 02:18:20.970]  Wow, this is incredible.
[02:18:21.271 --> 02:18:22.352]  And I said, yeah, I don't know.
[02:18:22.392 --> 02:18:27.358]  I just had the idea to mix everything known, you know, scientifically and in the wives' tales together to make you sleep.
[02:18:27.458 --> 02:18:28.379]  And, you know, it's powerful.
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:30.182]  And they're all game changers.
[02:18:30.222 --> 02:18:35.050]  You need to really go read the third-party reviews or power reviews and others that we have linked.
[02:18:35.651 --> 02:18:39.157]  Our average review on InfoWareStore.com, there's more than 40,000 reviews now, is 94%.
[02:18:43.809 --> 02:18:49.135]  They even had media investigations with BuzzFeed and people calling them going, we want to see it, it must be fake.
[02:18:49.155 --> 02:18:51.417]  They're like, no, it's really real.
[02:18:52.678 --> 02:18:56.522]  So they've had campaigns that people go on there and try to vote stuff down.
[02:18:56.562 --> 02:19:00.547]  I mean, they are just so angry where they test our stuff and test it and test it.
[02:19:00.607 --> 02:19:06.373]  California labs that has stuff nine times higher than EU that has the next highest standards.
[02:19:06.693 --> 02:19:12.700]  I mean, basically, there's more lead in the air in California than you can, quote, put in a supplement or any other product, unless you call it a food product.
[02:19:13.001 --> 02:19:15.483]  What is it, 60-something of our products are all California standard.
[02:19:15.503 --> 02:19:20.890]  But if you've got something that's got, I don't know, 10, 15 ingredients in it, and it's also a large serving like Caveman?
[02:19:21.210 --> 02:19:23.813]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, any can of chicken noodle soup.
[02:19:24.534 --> 02:19:27.336]  Has probably five times the lead California says is allowed.
[02:19:27.476 --> 02:19:28.197]  It's just insane.
[02:19:28.217 --> 02:19:31.759]  And then we test and test and test more than anybody we know of because we know.
[02:19:31.779 --> 02:19:34.201]  Now we're under a microscope, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:34.741 --> 02:19:38.844]  But thank you for committing to get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:19:39.224 --> 02:19:41.846]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:19:41.866 --> 02:19:48.671]  We're not like, it's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films, and you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:19:48.691 --> 02:19:51.813]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:19:52.133 --> 02:19:53.454]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:19:55.410 --> 02:19:57.171]  That's available at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:57.211 --> 02:19:59.432]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:32.370 --> 02:20:33.810]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:34.051 --> 02:20:35.231]  Well, so does he.
[02:20:35.711 --> 02:20:40.472]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:42.253 --> 02:20:50.935]  Here's the Facebook and Google administrators on Twitter announcing that they're going to be very fair in banning bullying, which they now call witchcraft.
[02:20:51.975 --> 02:20:57.377]  This is actual footage of a Google-Facebook meeting where they decided to censor InfoWars.
[02:21:00.996 --> 02:21:02.556]  How do you know she is a witch?
[02:21:02.756 --> 02:21:04.237]  She looks like one!
[02:21:05.717 --> 02:21:06.637]  Bring her forward.
[02:21:08.118 --> 02:21:09.138]  I'm not a witch!
[02:21:09.218 --> 02:21:10.258]  I'm not a witch!
[02:21:10.878 --> 02:21:12.278]  But you are dressed as one.
[02:21:12.539 --> 02:21:13.799]  They dress me up like this.
[02:21:14.139 --> 02:21:17.400]  And this isn't my nose, it's a false one.
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:21.680]  Well?
[02:21:22.501 --> 02:21:23.561]  Well, we did do the nose.
[02:21:24.221 --> 02:21:24.841]  The nose?
[02:21:25.661 --> 02:21:26.201]  And the hat.
[02:21:26.281 --> 02:21:27.042]  But she's a witch!
[02:21:30.908 --> 02:21:32.209]  Did you dress her up like this?
[02:21:32.549 --> 02:21:33.070]  No!
[02:21:33.130 --> 02:21:33.370]  No!
[02:21:33.430 --> 02:21:34.210]  No!
[02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:34.731]  No!
[02:21:34.791 --> 02:21:35.111]  Yes!
[02:21:35.271 --> 02:21:35.551]  Yes!
[02:21:35.591 --> 02:21:35.931]  Yes!
[02:21:36.172 --> 02:21:36.692]  A bit!
[02:21:36.992 --> 02:21:37.252]  A bit!
[02:21:37.312 --> 02:21:37.573]  A bit!
[02:21:37.613 --> 02:21:38.553]  She has got a wart!
[02:21:40.014 --> 02:21:41.835]  What makes you think she is a witch?
[02:21:42.096 --> 02:21:43.837]  Well, she turned me into a newt!
[02:21:45.238 --> 02:21:45.758]  A newt?
[02:21:49.521 --> 02:21:50.882]  I got better.
[02:21:50.902 --> 02:21:52.523]  Burn her, Eddie!
[02:21:52.583 --> 02:21:53.704]  Burn her!
[02:21:53.804 --> 02:21:54.284]  Burn her!
[02:21:54.324 --> 02:21:57.006]  They were actually chanting, burn her, to Dana Loesch.
[02:21:58.752 --> 02:21:59.993]  He got a clip of the gentleman that was there.
[02:22:00.013 --> 02:22:03.795]  We're going to go to him right now for a little bit of the next segment because I got to him late and we'll have our next guest on.
[02:22:04.275 --> 02:22:11.499]  Jacob Ingalls is the publisher of the Central Florida Post, centralfloridapost.com, and contributor with New Dawn Magazine.
[02:22:11.519 --> 02:22:19.323]  He's committed to true journalism on a local level and they tried to demonize him and make a fool of him, the one person, and they let him into this other town hall to do this.
[02:22:20.284 --> 02:22:22.225]  I wonder, behind the scenes, they chanted, burn him.
[02:22:22.265 --> 02:22:25.106]  He's been on The War Room before, I believe, because I recognize him.
[02:22:25.667 --> 02:22:27.988]  But Jacob Ingalls, thank you for joining us today.
[02:22:29.278 --> 02:22:30.339]  Great to be on the program.
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:32.262]  So major new controversy.
[02:22:32.282 --> 02:22:37.008]  Now you're working on a big story of another potential stand down in Florida and making another mass shooting.
[02:22:37.308 --> 02:22:42.374]  We want to know as much as you can tell us about that, but also just the whole state of the burn the gun owners meme that's going on.
[02:22:43.676 --> 02:22:49.622]  You know, it was really, really sad to see how CNN edited the gun control panel that I participated in.
[02:22:49.663 --> 02:22:53.567]  The first segment, they were very fair, very decent.
[02:22:53.607 --> 02:23:04.979]  But the second segment, where I brought up the fact that it wasn't too long ago, in the 1960s, Jim Crow South, that state and county governments systematically disarmed black citizens so they couldn't fight back against oppression.
[02:23:05.359 --> 02:23:06.020]  We have that clip, don't we?
[02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:08.321]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip of Jacob Ingalls and then flipping out.
[02:23:08.361 --> 02:23:08.762]  Here it is.
[02:23:35.283 --> 02:23:36.964]  Why can't I see an emotional response?
[02:23:37.004 --> 02:23:37.844]  What's wrong with you?
[02:23:37.864 --> 02:23:38.724]  Legislation.
[02:23:39.044 --> 02:23:40.705]  Legislation is not a bad thing.
[02:23:40.785 --> 02:23:46.226]  You have kids who should be grieving right now, and instead, adults are putting them on national television.
[02:23:46.246 --> 02:23:46.706]  Hold on.
[02:23:46.826 --> 02:23:48.247]  This I have to object to.
[02:23:48.307 --> 02:23:54.428]  I've never seen more motivated people come to a camera and want to tell their story about what they demand now.
[02:23:54.448 --> 02:23:56.409]  So these are not kids.
[02:23:56.429 --> 02:23:59.890]  They hijacked four of them, fed the narrative, and then got a bunch of other people to join.
[02:24:00.551 --> 02:24:01.092]  They're motivated.
[02:24:01.112 --> 02:24:05.540]  They watch their friends die and you're gonna bash on them?
[02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:11.392]  Who, show of hands, would be comfortable raising the age to purchase semi-automatic weapons to 21?
[02:24:13.769 --> 02:24:14.209]  Three of you.
[02:24:14.289 --> 02:24:16.970]  It's an arbitrary age, just like the drinking age is an arbitrary age.
[02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:19.690]  But you're comfortable with it being a higher arbitrary age.
[02:24:19.710 --> 02:24:19.790]  Yeah.
[02:24:20.130 --> 02:24:25.311]  You have 18-year-olds still in high school and you're going to sell them an assault weapon, or any weapon for that matter.
[02:24:25.631 --> 02:24:26.251]  It shouldn't be.
[02:24:26.271 --> 02:24:28.972]  You let them drive a car, Dumbo.
[02:24:29.272 --> 02:24:35.053]  This is this whole arrested development thing now, where they call 35, as they say, the new 16.
[02:24:35.253 --> 02:24:37.953]  These people are on how they're little.
[02:24:38.033 --> 02:24:39.614]  I love being lazy and dumb.
[02:24:39.634 --> 02:24:40.334]  I enjoy it.
[02:24:41.664 --> 02:24:43.365]  I can't listen to these idiots anymore.
[02:24:43.405 --> 02:24:45.386]  Jacob, what is it like being around these morons?
[02:24:46.667 --> 02:24:47.828]  You know, it's very interesting.
[02:24:47.868 --> 02:25:03.878]  When I went to the holding room in CNN and started talking to people before the panel, as soon as they realized that I wasn't for gun grabbing, that I wasn't for knee-jerk reaction gun control measures, and that I instead wanted to review the laws on the books, enforce them properly,
[02:25:04.378 --> 02:25:05.159]  I think we're good to go.
[02:25:33.934 --> 02:25:44.731]  To come for our guns and to convince the American people that anyone who doesn't agree with that are somehow child murderers and that's sick, it's depraved, and quite frankly I think it's a little demonic.
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:52.802]  Well it is, and all I know is, they said that I said nobody died or they were all brought in from California and it was all fake.
[02:25:52.822 --> 02:26:04.605]  And then they'd take my videos down where I said the opposite, and then they'd have Hogg and people running around calling me a piece of you-know-what and all sorts of names, and then say he wanted to debate me when I said do it, he backed down, and then they call that bullying.
[02:26:05.225 --> 02:26:06.545]  It's just, it's crazy.
[02:26:06.565 --> 02:26:15.368]  You know, the guy is being flown around, they're being flown around, not Hogg, a bunch of other young people on private jets to go around and like get other groups of people to run around and be anti-gun.
[02:26:15.388 --> 02:26:16.048]  This is crazy.
[02:26:18.051 --> 02:26:21.714]  Well, David Hogg, simply put, is full of hogwash.
[02:26:22.094 --> 02:26:26.857]  That individual... And they'll call that bullying, and I'll sue them if they take this video down.
[02:26:26.897 --> 02:26:27.057]  I am.
[02:26:27.217 --> 02:26:27.878]  They know already.
[02:26:28.518 --> 02:26:30.059]  Because he's an adult world.
[02:26:30.099 --> 02:26:32.621]  He's a spokesman calling me a piece of S-H-I-T.
[02:26:34.082 --> 02:26:35.603]  Bleak that, even for family channels.
[02:26:35.623 --> 02:26:36.484]  I shouldn't have said the whole word.
[02:26:37.164 --> 02:26:38.465]  I mean, CNN can say it all they want.
[02:26:38.505 --> 02:26:38.825]  I can't.
[02:26:39.606 --> 02:26:43.909]  Calling me a piece of you-know-what, and then you can't even make a joke saying he's wrong.
[02:26:45.324 --> 02:26:57.095]  David Hogg and everyone else who's standing up from that tragedy that happened put themselves in the public arena, and adults around them knew that they were putting them in the public arena, and when you're in the public arena, you're a public figure.
[02:26:57.416 --> 02:26:58.056]  It's fair game.
[02:26:58.156 --> 02:27:10.428]  I would argue that they're too young, and they're not developed enough to have been put in that position, but adults made that decision for them, and they've encouraged it, so now their proposals are going to be scrutinized, and that is only fair.
[02:27:12.503 --> 02:27:15.988]  What do you make of the other town hall where they were saying burn Dana Loesch right out of Monty Python?
[02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:32.072]  It just begs the question, are these people mentally competent, or are they so deranged from the election of Donald Trump that they have no longer control over their mental faculties?
[02:27:32.112 --> 02:27:43.254]  And I don't think they have control over themselves, and it's really sad because they're Americans, they're fellow humans, they're people that we want to help become better individuals, but it seems they've lost complete and total control.
[02:27:44.114 --> 02:27:47.215]  Oh, you ought to see him in Austin, not bragging, but
[02:27:49.552 --> 02:27:51.794]  The county is... I gotta get into it.
[02:27:52.094 --> 02:27:55.037]  The point is, is that I'm not even welcome in my own hometown.
[02:27:55.337 --> 02:28:03.003]  I was born in Dallas, but a lot of families from here, and I've been here since high school, and I've had family here since before it was a state, before it was its own country, when it was Mexico.
[02:28:03.704 --> 02:28:09.269]  And the Californians, they're not really Californians, but the little globalist bots, they get in my face everywhere.
[02:28:09.569 --> 02:28:13.992]  And when I speak back, they go, oh, you're bullying and getting mad when I get back in their face.
[02:28:14.012 --> 02:28:15.013]  That's mental illness.
[02:28:15.374 --> 02:28:17.996]  You get in somebody's face, and they can't believe it when they get back in yours.
[02:28:19.458 --> 02:28:20.559]  That's exactly the point.
[02:28:20.799 --> 02:28:31.164]  I've been consistently called Nazi, spat on, and any time I go to defend myself, they say, no, let's talk about intellect, let's talk about logic, let's be real here and talk one-on-one.
[02:28:31.424 --> 02:28:33.585]  They say, oh, you can't question me.
[02:28:34.125 --> 02:28:35.165]  My opinion is fact.
[02:28:36.446 --> 02:28:38.467]  They just start having this bastard.
[02:28:40.328 --> 02:28:40.568]  That's right.
[02:28:40.588 --> 02:28:42.049]  They can't control what's coming out of their mouth.
[02:28:42.109 --> 02:28:42.649]  It's scary.
[02:28:43.735 --> 02:29:01.032]  I want to ask you, right from the other side, where you think this is all going, and to get a little bit of that story you say you're working on without getting out any names yet, because we'll obviously know more by tomorrow, but I also want to get your take on Trump, as you being more of a libertarian pro-gun activist, what you make of him starting to go sideways, which is a nightmare.
[02:29:02.474 --> 02:29:05.277]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[02:29:06.207 --> 02:29:08.089]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:29:08.129 --> 02:29:17.558]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:29:18.659 --> 02:29:22.023]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:29:22.543 --> 02:29:24.884]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[02:29:25.104 --> 02:29:27.246]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[02:29:27.346 --> 02:29:27.746]  Thank you.
[02:29:28.406 --> 02:29:30.888]  I used the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[02:29:30.908 --> 02:29:34.650]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:38.191]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:29:38.231 --> 02:29:39.232]  They are quality.
[02:29:39.552 --> 02:29:40.793]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:29:41.293 --> 02:29:44.015]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:29:44.175 --> 02:29:44.715]  Absolutely.
[02:29:45.236 --> 02:29:58.159]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:30:03.570 --> 02:30:04.311]  I'm so excited.
[02:30:04.391 --> 02:30:13.937]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:30:14.517 --> 02:30:19.701]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:30:20.041 --> 02:30:22.843]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:30:23.043 --> 02:30:31.789]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:38.692]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[02:30:39.232 --> 02:30:41.993]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:30:42.133 --> 02:30:53.036]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:30:53.516 --> 02:30:54.797]  It is amazing!
[02:30:56.197 --> 02:31:01.159]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[02:31:03.109 --> 02:31:04.931]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:31:04.971 --> 02:31:05.332]  Go ahead.
[02:31:06.213 --> 02:31:08.115]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:31:08.155 --> 02:31:17.547]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:31:18.323 --> 02:31:24.885]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[02:31:25.105 --> 02:31:27.445]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[02:31:27.465 --> 02:31:27.746]  Thank you.
[02:31:28.406 --> 02:31:30.886]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[02:31:30.906 --> 02:31:34.667]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[02:31:35.227 --> 02:31:38.188]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:31:38.248 --> 02:31:39.229]  They are quality.
[02:31:39.569 --> 02:31:40.829]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:31:41.289 --> 02:31:44.010]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.710]  Absolutely.
[02:31:45.250 --> 02:31:58.162]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:32:02.958 --> 02:32:11.962]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:32:12.042 --> 02:32:20.145]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:20.445 --> 02:32:25.147]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:25.307 --> 02:32:32.030]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:39.194]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:32:39.274 --> 02:32:46.137]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:32:46.297 --> 02:32:50.660]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:54.043]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:32:54.183 --> 02:33:00.307]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:33:00.487 --> 02:33:02.689]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:33:06.392 --> 02:33:08.994]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.422 --> 02:33:25.543]  Big Brother.
[02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:26.803]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:27.344 --> 02:33:28.484]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:29.225 --> 02:33:30.706]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:30.946 --> 02:33:32.106]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:32.627 --> 02:33:37.349]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:38.050 --> 02:33:43.333]  Alright, we've got Dr. Steve Pachinikon with us, who was on the broadcast.
[02:33:44.394 --> 02:33:50.844]  What was it like Monday, and he said, don't worry Alex, it's rogue people at Google and YouTube, the channels will all be back.
[02:33:51.485 --> 02:33:53.368]  Well, they took Horsey's down, it's back.
[02:33:53.889 --> 02:33:55.131]  They had ours blocked, it's back.
[02:33:55.411 --> 02:33:58.035]  Military Arms Channel was down, I just got a text, that's back.
[02:33:59.278 --> 02:34:01.439]  Looks like thousands of sites are all coming back.
[02:34:02.019 --> 02:34:05.520]  And he goes, the relationship with the government and Google is very good.
[02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:06.141]  It'll be back.
[02:34:07.201 --> 02:34:13.784]  And I think it's the pressure and Drudge Report and everything coming back and them exposing it.
[02:34:13.864 --> 02:34:17.185]  But Pachinik did say that it was rogue people inside.
[02:34:17.225 --> 02:34:19.426]  So we're going to find out about this in just a minute.
[02:34:19.446 --> 02:34:21.347]  But finishing up, he's laughing.
[02:34:21.627 --> 02:34:22.567]  He likes my invitation.
[02:34:22.587 --> 02:34:23.347]  There you go.
[02:34:24.108 --> 02:34:25.308]  I always go crazy in the third hour.
[02:34:25.728 --> 02:34:26.829]  I wanted to go ahead and finish up.
[02:34:27.899 --> 02:34:35.809]  With the gentleman that we're talking to, Jacob Ingalls, who is on the CNN panel and who heads up a newspaper there in Florida, heads up the Central Florida Post.
[02:34:36.791 --> 02:34:37.792]  Where is this going now?
[02:34:37.852 --> 02:34:41.637]  What do you make of Trump starting to go sideways in his rhetoric on the Second Amendment?
[02:34:41.677 --> 02:34:46.003]  I mean, it's like they transplanted his brain with that of Dianne Feinstein's.
[02:34:47.590 --> 02:35:05.007]  I sincerely hope that our president is using this as a negotiating tactic and technique to give the Democrats and the Liberals an idea of, hey, we'll come to the table, we'll work with you, we'll give you a little bit of what you want, and then he drops the hammer at the last minute.
[02:35:05.848 --> 02:35:06.969]  I don't think he is, but it's rhetorical.
[02:35:29.341 --> 02:35:30.602]  It hurts the general movement.
[02:35:31.922 --> 02:35:38.286]  Can you get into the story you're working on, dealing with that situation, a new potential crisis?
[02:35:39.695 --> 02:35:42.118]  Yes, one of my sources gave me a call today.
[02:35:42.158 --> 02:35:48.343]  There's a local college here in Central Florida, and apparently yesterday there was an incident between a few students.
[02:35:48.544 --> 02:35:49.985]  A teacher got involved.
[02:35:50.025 --> 02:35:51.146]  There was a little bit of a scuffle.
[02:35:51.767 --> 02:36:04.959]  Campus security responded, and when this individual was being removed from the room and detained for the police, he made a comment, something to the effect of, I'm going to go get my gun and come back.
[02:36:05.823 --> 02:36:06.263]  Everyone.
[02:36:06.863 --> 02:36:11.624]  Now, the police, what I'm told by my sources, then bankracted this individual.
[02:36:11.984 --> 02:36:21.606]  But the concern we're having right now is that there was no check done, there was no real investigation, even if he is a danger, even if he has access to weapons.
[02:36:21.646 --> 02:36:33.969]  So our main concern now is that he's being bankracted, pumped full of psychotropic drugs, and then will just be haphazardly released back out into the world, where if he does have access to something, and he is,
[02:36:34.369 --> 02:36:38.032]  Mentally unstable and now he's got harmful chemicals in his body.
[02:36:38.052 --> 02:36:40.574]  That is tailor-made for disaster.
[02:36:40.634 --> 02:36:48.561]  I really really hope that the police are investigating this and and and not being as sloppy as they were down in Broward.
[02:36:50.803 --> 02:36:52.424]  We will watch this very closely.
[02:36:52.444 --> 02:36:54.186]  Jacob Ingalls, the Central Florida Post.
[02:36:54.206 --> 02:36:54.566]  Thank you.
[02:36:55.647 --> 02:36:56.708]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:36:56.748 --> 02:36:57.108]  You bet.
[02:36:57.168 --> 02:36:59.830]  Thanks for your courage to go into that den of vipers at CNN.
[02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:04.562]  Now, again, you just heard me introduce it, Dr. Steve Pachetnik is here.
[02:37:05.662 --> 02:37:09.384]  Here's one of the headlines, Gizmodo, YouTube terminates account of Infowars Bureau Chief.
[02:37:10.044 --> 02:37:16.607]  Had nothing to do with the shootings, did not say they were actors, talking about Trump striking back against the globalists politically.
[02:37:17.187 --> 02:37:19.528]  That's what they're scared of, the QAnon, the storm, all that.
[02:37:20.349 --> 02:37:24.931]  Meanwhile, YouTube mocks critics amid a censorship fight.
[02:37:26.712 --> 02:37:29.433]  Now, the reason this is important is that
[02:37:30.686 --> 02:37:33.927]  YouTube says they hired 10,000 SJWs.
[02:37:33.967 --> 02:37:35.027]  That's the criteria.
[02:37:35.848 --> 02:37:39.749]  It's also come out in the news in lawsuits that you can't be white or Asian.
[02:37:40.189 --> 02:37:41.750]  They've just said no more whites or Asians.
[02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:44.211]  And again, that makes it sound like, oh, affirmative action.
[02:37:44.271 --> 02:37:45.971]  No, it's like discrimination.
[02:37:46.271 --> 02:37:51.613]  Plus, they're now, the left's now saying, well, Asians didn't own any slaves, but they're still bad.
[02:37:52.293 --> 02:37:56.655]  So it's like, oh, people that work harder in school and do all this stuff, they're inherently bad.
[02:37:57.595 --> 02:38:01.538]  And by the way, whites are way down the line, like the top nine richest slots are Asian groups.
[02:38:02.079 --> 02:38:05.842]  Whites are like, I mean, whites are there with blacks, you name it, on average.
[02:38:06.042 --> 02:38:08.324]  It's a lot of rich white people, but there's also a ton of poor ones.
[02:38:08.564 --> 02:38:10.065]  That's why, Bernie Sanders!
[02:38:11.226 --> 02:38:14.929]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[02:38:15.149 --> 02:38:17.471]  Honeymoon to the Soviet Union!
[02:38:17.772 --> 02:38:19.633]  They know how to treat those Christians there!
[02:38:19.953 --> 02:38:20.914]  We could just do it!
[02:38:21.434 --> 02:38:23.676]  Hey, sorry, I want to be a big man!
[02:38:23.696 --> 02:38:24.877]  I'm going to be one someday!
[02:38:24.897 --> 02:38:26.158]  All right, let me get serious.
[02:38:27.519 --> 02:38:31.382]  And he does that bozo the clown hair, it'll look like he's Einstein, when he's really an idiot.
[02:38:32.343 --> 02:38:34.705]  Looks like he's like, he's in a straight jacket.
[02:38:34.965 --> 02:38:37.367]  We gotta take that picture and put him in a straight jacket.
[02:38:37.587 --> 02:38:38.207]  Alright, I'm gonna stop.
[02:38:38.748 --> 02:38:48.635]  Dr. Steve Pichinik joins us on Google and the big internet war that it looks like, I don't want to say we've turned the tide, but it's starting to turn where they're just saying it's a mistake, we're sorry.
[02:38:48.695 --> 02:38:49.555]  Is it the real headline?
[02:38:50.456 --> 02:38:58.365]  Google was hacked by its own employees in an internal civil war to purge conservatives and libertarians in like a desperate mutiny?
[02:38:58.645 --> 02:38:59.907]  I mean, that's what really happened.
[02:39:00.367 --> 02:39:05.333]  Suddenly, YouTube blank shushed and goes, Google goes, we had employees that did that who were unauthorized.
[02:39:05.333 --> 02:39:05.793]  I can't say a word.
[02:39:33.018 --> 02:39:35.419]  Your riff, it's almost impossible.
[02:39:35.779 --> 02:39:37.320]  It's exactly what I told you.
[02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:39.161]  Nothing's going to happen to you.
[02:39:39.681 --> 02:39:41.622]  You're too important to the Republic.
[02:39:42.302 --> 02:39:45.144]  And, I mean, like flatulence in a church.
[02:39:45.184 --> 02:39:46.844]  Who can come up with that kind of riff?
[02:39:46.925 --> 02:39:48.065]  That's why you're popular.
[02:39:48.585 --> 02:39:49.466]  Oh, stop, stop, stop.
[02:39:49.506 --> 02:39:50.746]  You're the guy that predicted this.
[02:39:52.287 --> 02:39:54.288]  Not a very hard prediction, Alex.
[02:39:54.569 --> 02:39:56.350]  Let's go back to our history.
[02:39:56.550 --> 02:40:03.455]  You and I and others have been on the forefront of whatever we could call it, an Infowar revolution.
[02:40:04.341 --> 02:40:11.986]  The people at Google, the people at Amazon, and all the other institutions got a wake-up call.
[02:40:12.287 --> 02:40:17.130]  And that wake-up call came very quickly after you and I had that discussion.
[02:40:17.370 --> 02:40:21.653]  But there were people within the government, and again, I go through this.
[02:40:22.174 --> 02:40:32.701]  There are loyalists within our government, in many, many of our 18 intelligence agencies, who are very concerned about what happens to this country.
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:39.003]  Right or wrong, they are committed as much as I am, you are, to the sustaining of the republic.
[02:40:39.244 --> 02:40:42.065]  Remember, the presidency is temporal.
[02:40:42.225 --> 02:40:56.053]  From our point of view, we want to maintain the integrity of the republic so that the nation state has a capacity for transaction, for national security, and for the ability to encourage entrepreneurship.
[02:40:56.133 --> 02:40:57.234]  This is what it's all about.
[02:40:57.634 --> 02:41:00.536]  But when entrepreneurship becomes a massive
[02:41:01.076 --> 02:41:11.026]  Fascist organization, which it could under Google, and the boys who started it came out of the Soviet Union and yours truly helped to get those boys out of the Soviet Union.
[02:41:11.427 --> 02:41:13.188]  We don't like what happens.
[02:41:13.288 --> 02:41:23.659]  So those of us who've been involved in conflict, those of us who were involved in taking down the Soviet Union, it's not me, the CIA and others who were involved in military intelligence.
[02:41:24.059 --> 02:41:32.609]  I understand very clearly that we're not going to reduplicate the Soviet Union in the guise of Google, Amazon, or any other institution.
[02:41:33.069 --> 02:41:38.676]  So they are in fact beholden to the different segments of our intelligence community.
[02:41:38.976 --> 02:41:39.577]  That's as simple as that.
[02:41:39.597 --> 02:41:53.713]  But there is a civil war within the companies, within the institutions, within the police departments, because if it wasn't for Drudge and the listeners getting upset and making it a major news story, I mean that obviously helped people also on the inside make the moral argument to make sure this stopped.
[02:41:54.154 --> 02:41:58.199]  Because somebody hired these 10,000 scallywags, brought them in to do this lynching.
[02:41:59.335 --> 02:42:03.916]  Well, however it occurred, it occurred, but you're correct.
[02:42:04.036 --> 02:42:10.797]  I've said to you for a long time ago, only 4% of the American population was involved in the Revolutionary War.
[02:42:10.917 --> 02:42:23.639]  We can take that to about 4 to 3% right now of the Americans who were involved in the active participation to make sure that we don't have these kinds of interference in our democracy and our republic.
[02:42:24.019 --> 02:42:26.680]  You happen to be the voice of that
[02:42:27.321 --> 02:42:27.702]  We're good.
[02:42:38.392 --> 02:42:44.438]  Alex Stone, Alex Jones, is extremely important to the integrity of the Republic.
[02:42:44.839 --> 02:42:45.980]  That's as simple as that.
[02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:47.001]  Well, everybody is.
[02:42:47.061 --> 02:42:48.042]  We're just a focal point.
[02:42:48.082 --> 02:42:49.183]  It's everybody on this show.
[02:42:49.243 --> 02:42:49.844]  It's everybody.
[02:42:50.084 --> 02:42:50.444]  It really is.
[02:42:50.504 --> 02:42:51.005]  It's everybody.
[02:42:51.065 --> 02:42:51.766]  And it's Matt Drudge.
[02:42:52.326 --> 02:42:55.810]  And let's come back and talk about what you think is going to happen next.
[02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:56.871]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:42:56.931 --> 02:42:59.033]  Next week's news today with Steve Potenic.
[02:42:59.053 --> 02:42:59.874]  StevePotenic.com.
[02:43:05.697 --> 02:43:07.078]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:43:07.138 --> 02:43:08.579]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:43:08.639 --> 02:43:09.000]  Go ahead.
[02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:09.400]  Yes.
[02:43:09.820 --> 02:43:10.541]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:10.641 --> 02:43:16.846]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:43:17.066 --> 02:43:21.050]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:22.731]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:43:23.091 --> 02:43:29.797]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:43:29.877 --> 02:43:32.739]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:43:33.579 --> 02:43:38.300]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:46.162]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:43:46.182 --> 02:43:52.003]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:43:52.143 --> 02:43:57.464]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:43:57.544 --> 02:44:00.545]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:44:05.347 --> 02:44:11.171]  Everybody needs to seriously go to sheriffjoeforamerica.com, sheriffjoeforamerica.com, and they need to donate.
[02:44:11.211 --> 02:44:14.234]  But this isn't about shooting our mouths off, it's about doing it.
[02:44:14.334 --> 02:44:18.397]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, what can we do to make sure you win this primary?
[02:44:20.037 --> 02:44:21.719]  Well, just what you're doing now, Alex.
[02:44:21.879 --> 02:44:22.781]  I appreciate it.
[02:44:22.841 --> 02:44:25.124]  Putting that word out.
[02:44:25.384 --> 02:44:27.647]  Motivating my base.
[02:44:28.067 --> 02:44:31.232]  I never lost a Republican primary.
[02:44:31.672 --> 02:44:33.394]  Even in the last election, I won by 40%.
[02:44:33.555 --> 02:44:38.261]  I'm a Republican primary, so I have strong support.
[02:44:38.961 --> 02:44:39.962]  Across the state.
[02:44:40.543 --> 02:44:42.545]  I've had that for years and years.
[02:44:42.625 --> 02:44:48.971]  And I want to thank all the people in other counties for always supporting me.
[02:44:49.651 --> 02:44:59.961]  Not that they could vote for me and so on, but I've been campaigning, not campaigning, giving speeches constantly, not only there, but recently across the nation.
[02:45:00.041 --> 02:45:03.024]  And I've been doing that, helping the Republican Party.
[02:45:03.884 --> 02:45:13.793]  When Donald Trump ran, I remember way back in June of 15, he announced he came here for his first rally in July 2015.
[02:45:14.713 --> 02:45:17.276]  I introduced him.
[02:45:17.696 --> 02:45:20.238]  He couldn't get any politics to get out of state.
[02:45:20.939 --> 02:45:21.579]  But I did.
[02:45:21.599 --> 02:45:23.441]  I never met him prior to that.
[02:45:24.401 --> 02:45:25.362]  I liked what I heard.
[02:45:26.203 --> 02:45:28.785]  And I said, he will be the next president.
[02:45:29.286 --> 02:45:29.866]  And he is.
[02:45:30.226 --> 02:45:30.847]  He made it.
[02:45:31.696 --> 02:45:35.798]  And I'll tell you, I don't go against people that I endorse.
[02:45:35.878 --> 02:45:37.599]  I stick with them to the bitter end.
[02:45:38.059 --> 02:45:39.500]  Especially President Trump.
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:41.961]  I'm with him to the bitter end.
[02:45:41.981 --> 02:45:43.342]  I don't like to say bitter.
[02:45:43.362 --> 02:45:44.943]  It's going to be successful, man.
[02:45:45.443 --> 02:45:46.443]  But you know what I'm talking about.
[02:45:46.463 --> 02:45:49.225]  Like Churchill said, we're going to defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[02:45:49.465 --> 02:45:51.526]  We're going to go on to the end, and we'll never surrender.
[02:45:51.906 --> 02:45:53.006]  I'm going to Washington.
[02:45:53.046 --> 02:45:55.047]  I'm going to straighten a lot of things out.
[02:45:55.547 --> 02:46:00.028]  If they don't put me on any committees, okay, I'll form my own committee.
[02:46:00.588 --> 02:46:02.049]  So, we'll see what happens.
[02:46:02.149 --> 02:46:05.270]  And that's what the president's going to do in six days with his fake news awards.
[02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:07.710]  We're just taking the narrative back.
[02:46:07.770 --> 02:46:09.811]  And, you know, they censor us off everything else.
[02:46:09.831 --> 02:46:10.811]  We just create our own system.
[02:46:11.091 --> 02:46:14.496]  And once again, the President knows what he's doing.
[02:46:14.517 --> 02:46:17.060]  I think that's what really scares everybody.
[02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:18.442]  That's why they keep going after him.
[02:46:18.462 --> 02:46:21.908]  Yeah, they're saying he's an idiot and mentally ill and all this.
[02:46:22.188 --> 02:46:22.869]  Well, that's the case.
[02:46:22.889 --> 02:46:23.670]  We need more of that.
[02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:24.932]  SheriffJoeForAmerica.com
[02:46:26.574 --> 02:46:30.196]  And we hope people go and donate and support, and we'll track as you go.
[02:46:30.216 --> 02:46:37.139]  I got a gut feeling you're gonna win if people get behind you, but regardless, you're gonna inject real ideas, and you are, I gotta say it, I mean, we gotta admire fighters.
[02:46:37.159 --> 02:46:41.521]  Compare Sheriff Joe to these millennials, who, a lot of them are great folks, but just so entitled, so lazy.
[02:46:41.901 --> 02:46:48.344]  This fellow, for his country, fighting super hard and sharper than, you know, 20-year-olds out there when he's 80-plus years old.
[02:46:48.364 --> 02:46:49.464]  I don't say that as a bad thing.
[02:46:49.504 --> 02:46:50.485]  It's a positive thing.
[02:46:50.945 --> 02:46:55.647]  And we're very, very proud of you, Sheriff Joe, for everything you've done and letting them attack you and lie about you.
[02:46:56.007 --> 02:46:56.988]  We really appreciate you.
[02:46:57.148 --> 02:46:57.568]  Thank you.
[02:47:06.372 --> 02:47:09.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.963 --> 02:47:21.605]  All right, final segment of this hour.
[02:47:21.625 --> 02:47:29.214]  Joel Gilbert normally hosts on Fridays at the fourth hour, but I'm going to commandeer the next two segments of that because we've got the Military Arms Channel.
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:32.401]  Tens of millions of views, hundreds of millions of views.
[02:47:33.161 --> 02:47:34.141]  I've seen it.
[02:47:34.541 --> 02:47:36.342]  I couldn't see it anymore because they deleted the channel.
[02:47:36.382 --> 02:47:39.123]  I couldn't go actually look it up, but it was banned to see what it had on there.
[02:47:39.143 --> 02:47:40.603]  But we can have those statistics back now.
[02:47:41.083 --> 02:47:42.344]  They just reinstated that today.
[02:47:42.404 --> 02:47:47.305]  So first they reinstated InfoWars, and now hundreds of accounts we know of, so I guess that must be thousands.
[02:47:47.945 --> 02:47:51.106]  But then they hit Corsi last night and deleted him, and then it was back up this morning.
[02:47:51.586 --> 02:47:53.087]  So this is an act of
[02:47:54.565 --> 02:47:55.045]  Mutiny.
[02:47:55.545 --> 02:48:05.329]  And I'm really worried about somebody killing the president that works in the White House or, you know, something like that because I deal with leftists and they're so deranged now, Trump derangement syndrome, that is real.
[02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:18.934]  They're so crazed that they're... I don't think we're out of the woods because they're still shadow banning, they're still curtailing libertarian talk, but their naked attempt to ban everything really blew up in their face.
[02:48:18.974 --> 02:48:20.255]  Is that what you're getting at, Dr. Pachenik?
[02:48:21.775 --> 02:48:30.739]  Yeah, it's pretty much I'm not worried that anybody's going to assassinate or hurt Trump because I'm quite familiar with the Secret Service.
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:35.041]  And for over 30 years, they've been exceedingly, exceedingly good.
[02:48:35.081 --> 02:48:39.003]  It's one of the few institutions that we really don't appreciate.
[02:48:39.063 --> 02:48:40.784]  It's a 24-7 job.
[02:48:41.264 --> 02:48:43.805]  When I ran the psychiatric units at St.
[02:48:43.825 --> 02:48:47.607]  Elizabeth's, we reported literally on a weekly, if not daily basis.
[02:48:47.947 --> 02:48:48.828]  This is back on the 70s.
[02:48:49.888 --> 02:48:55.430]  Yes, into anyone who had a psychiatric problem or who might in any way hurt the president.
[02:48:55.470 --> 02:48:58.751]  So the Secret Services were very well staffed.
[02:48:58.791 --> 02:49:02.232]  I know they're working very hard right now, but I'm not worried about that.
[02:49:02.392 --> 02:49:04.133]  Actually, I'm not even worried about the left.
[02:49:04.733 --> 02:49:12.276]  What does concern me, and I'm going to change it a little bit, is that Trump announced a tariff of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum.
[02:49:13.889 --> 02:49:22.435]  What that does is really create a tariff war, which at this particular point in time, I do not agree with.
[02:49:22.656 --> 02:49:30.722]  It's something that has major ramifications, particularly for our closest allies, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea.
[02:49:30.742 --> 02:49:32.323]  Isn't he doing it as a negotiating point?
[02:49:33.661 --> 02:49:38.967]  He may be, but he invoked national security, which isn't exactly a negotiating point.
[02:49:39.107 --> 02:49:40.990]  And he said it's really quite simple.
[02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:48.759]  We're at the tail end of a steel deficit, and we really want to increase the price of steel as it comes in.
[02:49:49.259 --> 02:49:50.841]  Well, that's not exactly correct.
[02:49:51.021 --> 02:49:54.724]  We don't have that type of steel deficit.
[02:49:55.204 --> 02:49:57.326]  Our companies, Nucor, U.S.
[02:49:57.346 --> 02:50:11.939]  Steel, are important companies, but they can't produce the amount of steel that we need in the various industries at the prices that we had with imports of steel coming from Canada and aluminum and particularly from... Are you saying it's going to trigger inflation?
[02:50:13.075 --> 02:50:14.196]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:50:14.396 --> 02:50:18.878]  It's triggering not only inflation but a major uncertainty in the stock market.
[02:50:18.918 --> 02:50:28.984]  We've lost about $500 billion over the past two days and we're heading in for what we call a fifth day of distribution and a major, major pullback.
[02:50:29.364 --> 02:50:30.666]  Sure, it's a form of an embargo, but China
[02:50:49.648 --> 02:50:52.370]  You know, it keeps lowering their taxes to counter us.
[02:50:53.071 --> 02:50:54.212]  And what are we supposed to do?
[02:50:54.292 --> 02:50:56.934]  I mean, we got de-industrialized this way.
[02:50:57.394 --> 02:51:02.798]  I agree that maybe just announcing he's doing it instead of saying, I may do it, it has caused some jitters.
[02:51:02.878 --> 02:51:05.300]  But, you know, I don't know.
[02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:08.562]  They're trying to push that a depression could be triggered from this.
[02:51:08.582 --> 02:51:10.123]  But I thought the depression was already happening.
[02:51:10.584 --> 02:51:12.245]  And then they came along with smooth haulings.
[02:51:13.357 --> 02:51:14.217]  No, not really.
[02:51:14.557 --> 02:51:15.638]  There was no depression.
[02:51:15.718 --> 02:51:17.338]  Our economy is quite strong.
[02:51:17.398 --> 02:51:26.381]  And what happened is Mr. Powell of the Federal Reserve, I admire what he does, hinted very clearly that we're going to have four increases in interest rates.
[02:51:26.881 --> 02:51:37.685]  So that's when the stock market pulled back a thousand points or more because we weren't used to having an increased GDP and at the same time having a increase in interest.
[02:51:37.745 --> 02:51:38.745]  That's actually a good point.
[02:51:38.865 --> 02:51:42.026]  I criticized the rates just because they didn't do it for Obama, they did it for Trump.
[02:51:42.386 --> 02:51:44.607]  I kind of thought they were trying to hurt things, but you're right.
[02:51:44.667 --> 02:51:48.908]  If the economy is booming back, you're supposed to raise interest rates, which encourages savings.
[02:51:49.868 --> 02:51:50.288]  Correct.
[02:51:50.508 --> 02:52:02.151]  But on the other hand, the stock markets don't know exactly when those interest rates come in and how much it will affect it, particularly when there's announcements that there will be three and possibly four.
[02:52:02.551 --> 02:52:06.693]  More importantly, you have to understand, the amount of steel that we get from China is less than 5%.
[02:52:06.933 --> 02:52:07.053]  It's 2%.
[02:52:08.693 --> 02:52:18.782]  What we're really concerned about, I mean in general, both in the national military area and in the business area where I'm involved as well, is that we have allies like Canada.
[02:52:18.842 --> 02:52:20.564]  We can't afford to alienate them.
[02:52:20.584 --> 02:52:21.444]  We have Germany.
[02:52:21.805 --> 02:52:22.685]  That's an ally.
[02:52:22.785 --> 02:52:30.912]  Britain depends very heavily on our ability to have imports of their steel and to have exports that we can bring to them.
[02:52:30.953 --> 02:52:32.334]  And in the process of Brexit,
[02:52:32.754 --> 02:52:34.857]  We're hurting them at this point.
[02:52:34.877 --> 02:52:35.418]  You're right there.
[02:52:35.478 --> 02:52:37.161]  Trump has promised them better trade deals.
[02:52:37.521 --> 02:52:39.024]  This is kind of a slap to Britain.
[02:52:39.963 --> 02:52:41.244]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:52:41.644 --> 02:52:54.535]  And in a way, what I'm cautioning Trump to do is to listen to Mr. Cohen and to Wilbur Ross and actually the guys at Goldman Sachs and the others who understand the ramifications of a tariff.
[02:52:54.615 --> 02:52:55.516]  So let me bring this up.
[02:52:55.576 --> 02:52:58.879]  Listeners hear that and they go, Goldman Sachs, that's the globals that got us this position.
[02:52:59.199 --> 02:53:01.621]  Well, if Goldman Sachs starts working for the country, that's a different deal.
[02:53:01.881 --> 02:53:03.903]  And I know there's been some power structured things, but you've got
[02:53:04.443 --> 02:53:14.034]  You've got the head of Goldman Sachs, Blankfein, kind of shooting his mouth off against Trump and making jokes about China's going to be supreme, but then it is going to be Goldman Sachs underwriting a lot of this other stuff.
[02:53:14.054 --> 02:53:18.099]  So give us a little inside baseball from your sources about what's going on at Goldman Sachs.
[02:53:18.968 --> 02:53:22.289]  Well, Goldman Sachs, it's an investment banking.
[02:53:22.649 --> 02:53:24.569]  I've been a managing director at Kidder.
[02:53:24.649 --> 02:53:28.290]  It wasn't at the same quality Goldman Sachs, but it's pretty much the same thing.
[02:53:28.310 --> 02:53:31.710]  You have diversified entities within that structure.
[02:53:31.750 --> 02:53:33.670]  You have people who are exceedingly good.
[02:53:34.071 --> 02:53:38.791]  These are people who are traders, although the trading factor into Goldman Sachs, I think, was eliminated.
[02:53:39.231 --> 02:53:44.452]  What they're very good at is analyzing the economic ramifications of certain acts.
[02:53:44.512 --> 02:53:48.853]  That's what happens at Societal General and all the major investment banking
[02:53:49.393 --> 02:53:53.276]  I wouldn't call Goldman Sachs literally a globalist.
[02:53:53.316 --> 02:54:05.082]  They fund America, they fund various areas of the world, but in fact, contrary to the common idea that a Zionist will take over and Goldman Sachs will take over or Rothschild, that's nonsense now.
[02:54:05.483 --> 02:54:16.809]  Because in an era where we're heading into quantum encryption, like we have a company like BFBT, we're way beyond the ability now to affect the digits one and zero on a simple level.
[02:54:16.889 --> 02:54:18.130]  So anything that
[02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:22.412]  Trump says has an exponential factor to it.
[02:54:22.532 --> 02:54:27.634]  It radiates so quickly out there that China is not just concerned about itself.
[02:54:27.754 --> 02:54:34.176]  It's really concerned about the fact that it's going to affect many, many of the countries around Asia, Southeast Asia.
[02:54:34.196 --> 02:54:38.238]  Well, Trump said he was going to renegotiate NAFTA and yet a lot of this has been unfair to our country.
[02:54:38.558 --> 02:54:39.978]  So we need to negotiate this.
[02:54:40.318 --> 02:54:41.819]  And isn't he just fulfilling his promises?
[02:54:42.734 --> 02:54:42.894]  No.
[02:54:43.135 --> 02:54:45.740]  He hasn't effectively negotiated NAFTA.
[02:54:45.780 --> 02:54:49.186]  He has not effectively looked at the tariff agreement.
[02:54:49.226 --> 02:54:53.153]  He has not worked out the ramifications of what a tariff means.
[02:54:53.814 --> 02:54:55.758]  Well then who is advising him then?
[02:54:57.131 --> 02:55:18.418]  I would say Cohen, Ross, I don't know who the specific individuals are that would have told him to say, look, I'm going to impose a tariff immediately on steel and aluminum, and I'm a day trader, and I can tell you that market was pulled back so quickly that four days in a row we had what we call distribution, which means we may be headed for another major pullback of $500.
[02:55:18.518 --> 02:55:19.339]  No, I got it.
[02:55:19.359 --> 02:55:22.540]  You're saying this could cause a major stock market correction.
[02:55:22.580 --> 02:55:23.220]  But here's the thing.
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:26.262]  Trump's policies so far have brought the economy back.
[02:55:26.822 --> 02:55:30.364]  So, I mean, it comes to kind of like dancing with the one that brung you.
[02:55:30.384 --> 02:55:35.487]  If he's been right so far, then, you know, why sit there and say this is wrong?
[02:55:35.507 --> 02:55:39.710]  I mean, I got mixed feelings across the board, but I think we're going to see what happens.
[02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:41.151]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:55:42.011 --> 02:55:51.357]  Politically, what do you make of just all the stuff we're seeing with the Democrats and all their calls for impeachment and all the rest of it?
[02:55:51.377 --> 02:55:52.458]  You're saying you're not worried about that?
[02:55:53.228 --> 02:55:55.189]  No, that's just absolute nonsense.
[02:55:55.289 --> 02:56:04.792]  What's far more significant is what we were doing here on your show almost a year, year and a half ago when we said Hope Hicks has to leave, Jared Kushner will be leaving.
[02:56:04.832 --> 02:56:05.792]  Oh, that's the question.
[02:56:05.812 --> 02:56:08.113]  Do you have any information on why Hope Hicks left?
[02:56:09.213 --> 02:56:09.533]  Yes.
[02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:11.774]  The reason was very simple.
[02:56:11.934 --> 02:56:15.214]  She was very seductive, very effective.
[02:56:15.674 --> 02:56:23.276]  But as a Greenwich graduate, she knew better than to seduce the men in the White House if she had nothing else to do.
[02:56:24.076 --> 02:56:29.517]  And being close to the president doesn't necessarily mean you're being manipulative and seductive.
[02:56:29.877 --> 02:56:32.178]  Being close to the president means you're being discreet.
[02:56:32.758 --> 02:56:43.787]  And she knew her family, and granted she was involved in public relations, she should have been a lot more discreet than seduce a man, Porter, who was already on the watch list with the FBI.
[02:56:44.267 --> 02:56:51.953]  John Kelly could not afford to have this kind of nonsense going on in the White House, and in fact, really insisted on cleaning this out.
[02:56:52.373 --> 02:57:05.619]  And this is one of the reasons why we in the community, intelligence and military community, insist on having a John Kelly, insist on having a Mattis, probably a McMaster, he may go to Fort Bragg, and we have a Pompeo and CIA.
[02:57:06.059 --> 02:57:12.422]  Not because we want military control, but we need a command and control system that has accountability.
[02:57:12.762 --> 02:57:15.423]  With a Hope Hicks, with a Jared Kushner, with an Ivanka.
[02:57:15.503 --> 02:57:16.724]  We have no accountability.
[02:57:17.064 --> 02:57:21.848]  Jared Kushner's now up on the crosshairs of being indicted for criminal activity.
[02:57:21.868 --> 02:57:24.070]  Well, you said a year and a half ago they're going to go after him for China.
[02:57:24.711 --> 02:57:26.212]  And now Mueller's off on China stuff.
[02:57:26.252 --> 02:57:27.193]  That's not in his mandate.
[02:57:28.594 --> 02:57:33.078]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:36.701]  My only point is, is they want to get Trump.
[02:57:37.342 --> 02:57:40.144]  And so, okay, Kushner gets some money from some foreign banks.
[02:57:40.404 --> 02:57:41.886]  That's before he was even, it's like,
[02:57:42.995 --> 02:57:44.457]  Why is Mueller going after Kusher?
[02:57:44.477 --> 02:57:45.499]  I'm trying to protect Kusher.
[02:57:45.559 --> 02:57:48.843]  It's just, you've got the Clintons that have done 50 million things worse.
[02:57:55.754 --> 02:58:02.517]  This is the best deal we've ever offered on our flagship product, DNA Force.
[02:58:02.677 --> 02:58:04.517]  And it's got a very interesting story behind it.
[02:58:04.657 --> 02:58:10.360]  I was at a medical doctor's clinic facility that had top-of-the-line nutraceuticals and was noticing that they were $200 to $400.
[02:58:10.460 --> 02:58:21.184]  And then I talked to my dad about it, who is a physician, and he said, absolutely, this is the biggest area in nutraceuticals and supplements is longevity and keeping your telomeres in place.
[02:58:21.204 --> 02:58:24.025]  You can't make telomeres grow, you can just make them not shrink as fast.
[02:58:24.065 --> 02:58:24.385]  Well, I
[02:58:24.605 --> 02:58:45.943]  I designed DNA Force with Dr. Group, and Dr. Group's a great guy, but then we were going to come out with Cell Force because I was able to find just as good of the same compounds for a lower price, and was able to develop Cell Force, and Group liked the formula so much, he said, listen, we were going to come out with DNA Force Plus, you just use that name and do it, because this is such an incredible formula.
[02:58:46.463 --> 02:58:52.007]  And I understand you're going to one of the biggest labs in the country, and so you were able to scale up and lower price, and I want to do that.
[02:58:52.387 --> 02:58:57.631]  He was so classy, he just said, you just put out DNA Force Plus as Shell Force, or vice versa.
[02:58:57.691 --> 02:58:59.752]  I was partnering with him on that, that's how classy he is.
[02:58:59.792 --> 02:59:01.774]  So, Shell Force is a limited run.
[02:59:01.854 --> 02:59:03.275]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[02:59:03.375 --> 02:59:10.280]  It will be called DNA Force Plus, because it's stronger than the old DNA Force, and it is less money.
[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:13.262]  It's a good deal normally at $149, like DNA Force was, and we'd sell it for $99.
[02:59:15.143 --> 02:59:15.584]  On sale.
[02:59:15.664 --> 02:59:17.185]  We're selling it for $70.45.
[02:59:18.347 --> 02:59:21.410]  Used to, that's almost what it cost to make a bottle of DNA Force.
[02:59:21.430 --> 02:59:24.453]  Well, now we've lowered the price on the ingredients by buying even more.
[02:59:24.553 --> 02:59:26.776]  Just as high quality, we're lowering it for you.
[02:59:26.796 --> 02:59:29.178]  This is the best deal ever on DNA Force.
[02:59:29.599 --> 02:59:32.322]  It's DNA Force Plus, but called Cell Force.
[02:59:32.782 --> 02:59:45.307]  Because we weren't going to step on groups toes, we just put out CellForce separately, with a similar name to DNAForce, and it's even stronger and a lower price, super high quality, promotes cellular energy production, supports optimal mental health, and so much more.
[02:59:45.607 --> 02:59:46.688]  And it supports the InfoWar.
[02:59:46.868 --> 02:59:49.249]  Get the best deal ever at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:59:55.071 --> 03:00:00.994]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.690 --> 03:00:09.750]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:28.931 --> 03:00:34.615]  Alright, Dr. Steve Pachanek is our guest, best-selling author, works at the State Department and other agencies, just a great source of info.
[03:00:34.855 --> 03:00:39.858]  Different respects, you may not totally agree with all of it, but it's always thought-provoking and it ends up being pretty accurate down the road.
[03:00:40.939 --> 03:00:45.602]  We just went to break, and I was asking the question that my daughter called me.
[03:00:45.942 --> 03:00:49.564]  I guess they were off school today, about to come home, and she was wanting something.
[03:00:49.584 --> 03:00:51.145]  I don't remember, why was I saying hold over?
[03:00:51.185 --> 03:00:53.067]  What was the question, Dr. Pachanek, I got you to hold over for?
[03:00:54.244 --> 03:00:58.886]  The issue was Mueller and you said, will Mueller indict Trump and is he dangerous?
[03:00:58.926 --> 03:00:59.987]  The answer is no.
[03:01:00.207 --> 03:01:04.109]  What happened, and I've said it for a year or so, and most people didn't pick it up.
[03:01:04.739 --> 03:01:09.424]  I said, I think Mueller is making amends for what he participated in 9-11.
[03:01:09.484 --> 03:01:11.406]  Mueller comes out of St.
[03:01:11.486 --> 03:01:11.846]  Paul's.
[03:01:12.287 --> 03:01:16.331]  He was really a war hero in Vietnam, and he got co-opted by the Bushes.
[03:01:16.871 --> 03:01:27.402]  I think what's happening now is Mueller's working with Trump, quite frankly, and he's doing... I heard this months ago from SG Silver Bull and all those guys, and more and more... Could that actually be happening?
[03:01:28.194 --> 03:01:35.136]  Yes, because Mueller can do the one thing that Trump can't do within his own family, and that is to fire Jared Kushner.
[03:01:35.556 --> 03:01:50.541]  Although Trump himself has been very annoyed with this young man... By the way, I never... I want you to finish, but I never believed that until the indictment came out, and it's a bunch of Russians getting funded by Soros and stuff to manipulate the election, which we knew really went on.
[03:01:50.601 --> 03:01:53.362]  Not Russia itself, but people using Russian companies.
[03:01:53.682 --> 03:01:57.103]  So when I saw that, I thought, is Mueller actually really been turned back to Trump?
[03:01:58.226 --> 03:01:58.987]  Yeah.
[03:01:59.287 --> 03:02:02.349]  Mueller's more interested not so much in the Russian affairs.
[03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:03.831]  That's just, I think, a cover.
[03:02:03.871 --> 03:02:09.375]  What he's really going after is Manafort, who we talked about, I said a year and a half ago, get rid of him.
[03:02:09.415 --> 03:02:10.096]  He was corrupt.
[03:02:10.436 --> 03:02:11.057]  He's corrupt.
[03:02:11.777 --> 03:02:14.379]  Kushner is the equal corruption to Manafort.
[03:02:14.439 --> 03:02:15.941]  Kushner brought in Manafort.
[03:02:16.541 --> 03:02:17.342]  Equally corrupt.
[03:02:17.482 --> 03:02:19.143]  And this is more than just the Russian.
[03:02:19.504 --> 03:02:22.166]  The Chinese control 666 Fifth Avenue.
[03:02:22.186 --> 03:02:24.107]  That's what you said a year and a half ago.
[03:02:24.167 --> 03:02:26.870]  That's what they're looking at Kushner for is the Chinese money.
[03:02:27.939 --> 03:02:30.401]  And not only Chinese money, but Israeli money.
[03:02:30.481 --> 03:02:38.687]  The money that comes from Bank Lumi is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and he has a major loan, as he quote, is our diplomat to the Middle East.
[03:02:39.048 --> 03:02:44.892]  He'll ask also major loans from an Israeli loan company, which he hadn't identified.
[03:02:45.232 --> 03:02:46.593]  He has other major loans.
[03:02:46.633 --> 03:02:48.975]  He's had bankruptcy in his paper.
[03:02:49.375 --> 03:02:51.037]  He is a total disaster.
[03:02:51.197 --> 03:02:52.798]  I said from day one, this was a
[03:02:52.978 --> 03:03:02.486]  Stupid, incompetent, corrupt individual who mirrors very much what his father was, who was indicted and convicted and went to jail under Christie.
[03:03:02.806 --> 03:03:10.513]  Now trust me, in a corrupt state like New Jersey, for his father to go to a corrupt prison, you have to be exceedingly corrupt.
[03:03:10.653 --> 03:03:12.234]  And that's corrupt Kushner.
[03:03:12.555 --> 03:03:13.616]  And Trump knows that.
[03:03:14.056 --> 03:03:15.517]  And he has to get rid of him.
[03:03:15.557 --> 03:03:18.500]  Then why in Hades would he bring him into the center of the White House?
[03:03:19.161 --> 03:03:20.582]  Because he has a daughter.
[03:03:21.223 --> 03:03:22.064]  You have a daughter.
[03:03:22.224 --> 03:03:35.818]  If your daughter asks something, and he thinks the world of his daughter, and he sent her out to South Korea... I love my daughters, but if they... I mean, if they had some son buying buildings called 666 for three times what they were worth, I'd say he was married to a moron.
[03:03:36.755 --> 03:03:38.377]  Well, what can I tell you?
[03:03:38.757 --> 03:03:41.219]  I can't get involved in their private relationship.
[03:03:41.239 --> 03:03:42.300]  No, I don't even hate Kushner.
[03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:43.662]  The point is I don't even dislike him.
[03:03:43.962 --> 03:03:45.403]  I didn't really know because he never talks.
[03:03:45.443 --> 03:03:47.826]  I don't know if he's good or bad or what's going on.
[03:03:47.866 --> 03:03:49.127]  I don't wish any harm upon him.
[03:03:49.427 --> 03:03:51.609]  And I mean, you know, getting loans for your buildings, whatever.
[03:03:51.629 --> 03:03:52.530]  He's not running the government.
[03:03:52.971 --> 03:03:56.834]  I don't think there's an issue of him getting Chinese money unless he's in the White House.
[03:03:57.155 --> 03:04:00.258]  I mean, who cares who helps you buy a building as long as you're not in the government, right?
[03:04:00.825 --> 03:04:01.766]  Well, that's correct.
[03:04:01.806 --> 03:04:02.927]  But that's not the issue.
[03:04:03.007 --> 03:04:06.791]  He's been going into negotiations with Russians who owe him money.
[03:04:07.191 --> 03:04:11.695]  He's been going into negotiation in Israel and picked out the most corrupt of all leaders.
[03:04:11.735 --> 03:04:13.257]  And I've said it before, Bibi.
[03:04:13.597 --> 03:04:14.478]  I've said it for years.
[03:04:14.558 --> 03:04:16.019]  Bibi has to leave Israel.
[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:17.641]  There's no question about it.
[03:04:17.721 --> 03:04:25.108]  Bibi is so corrupt that their own police department has already indicted him for several hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:04:25.248 --> 03:04:26.129]  And Bibi is on the
[03:04:26.189 --> 03:04:30.330]  Well, I don't know all the, you know, internal war battles that go on and all this stuff.
[03:04:30.350 --> 03:04:37.471]  I just know that the President's moving the country forward, and I don't really see the corruption, so I just think they ought to leave the whole thing alone.
[03:04:37.511 --> 03:04:39.011]  But whatever, we'll see what happens.
[03:04:39.031 --> 03:04:39.711]  It's crazy.
[03:04:39.731 --> 03:04:40.491]  Thank you, Dr. Puccini.
[03:04:40.572 --> 03:04:41.112]  Appreciate you.
[03:04:55.114 --> 03:04:55.295]  No.
[03:04:55.856 --> 03:04:57.900]  We got the Military Arms Channel coming on.
[03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:59.102]  They got banned by YouTube.
[03:04:59.142 --> 03:05:00.124]  Now it's been reinstated.
[03:05:00.465 --> 03:05:01.286]  Why is this happening?
[03:05:04.229 --> 03:05:09.070]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:06:17.142 --> 03:06:21.704]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:06:22.024 --> 03:06:23.565]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.185 --> 03:06:26.186]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:06:26.487 --> 03:06:30.949]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[03:06:32.844 --> 03:06:36.189]  We've got Tim Harmsen of the Military Arms Show on YouTube.
[03:06:36.209 --> 03:06:38.633]  We're going to be talking to him here in just a moment.
[03:06:40.355 --> 03:06:47.506]  The reason we've got him on is that all the thousands of YouTube accounts of libertarians, conservatives, sites like his have hundreds of millions of views.
[03:06:49.977 --> 03:06:54.659]  This is just one we've picked out, because I've watched some of the videos and know who he is, to just have on.
[03:06:55.420 --> 03:06:56.940]  A lot of listeners are really mad at us.
[03:06:56.960 --> 03:06:58.841]  They're like, my site got taken down, my thing.
[03:06:59.162 --> 03:07:02.543]  I can't even, in all the hours of the day, keep track of what's going on.
[03:07:02.823 --> 03:07:03.784]  So I apologize.
[03:07:04.144 --> 03:07:05.565]  Yes, I know a lot of you got purged.
[03:07:05.925 --> 03:07:07.486]  Christians are getting purged off Facebook.
[03:07:08.006 --> 03:07:09.707]  Veterans groups are getting purged off everything.
[03:07:10.147 --> 03:07:15.490]  Christian groups, gun owner groups, Second Amendment groups, 4-H shooting clubs.
[03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:17.611]  I mean, I can't even keep track of this, okay?
[03:07:18.711 --> 03:07:24.316]  Believe me, just because I'm not talking about your channel and you're sending me emails, it's thousands.
[03:07:25.297 --> 03:07:26.398]  Because I've seen hundreds.
[03:07:28.520 --> 03:07:32.663]  I look at articles on our website and a lot of the videos are dead because so many sites we link to are gone.
[03:07:33.904 --> 03:07:36.046]  So I can't keep track of how many fish there are in the sea.
[03:07:36.846 --> 03:07:38.468]  What we do know is this attack happened.
[03:07:38.508 --> 03:07:39.549]  We know it's taken place.
[03:07:41.198 --> 03:07:43.600]  And we know they lied about what we were saying and doing to do it.
[03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:45.661]  Said we were bullying children and said nobody died.
[03:07:45.702 --> 03:07:48.283]  Well, that's our right to do even if it's bull, but we didn't do that.
[03:07:48.964 --> 03:07:51.826]  So now Bloomberg comes out two days ago and goes, they apologize.
[03:07:51.866 --> 03:08:00.073]  YouTube says that they hired 10,000 people and they mistakenly flagged stuff that wasn't hateful or wasn't bullying.
[03:08:00.613 --> 03:08:06.297]  But it all started last Friday when CNN said they were advising YouTube employees on what to take down.
[03:08:07.558 --> 03:08:09.720]  That's the really unfair business practices.
[03:08:09.740 --> 03:08:10.601]  That's sabotage.
[03:08:11.972 --> 03:08:19.118]  If you've got a hamburger place and I call regulators and I'm there with the regulators saying, see there's still milk on the malt machine, shut them down.
[03:08:19.439 --> 03:08:23.402]  And then across the street I've got two foot long cockroaches bigger than chihuahuas.
[03:08:23.903 --> 03:08:25.925]  And that's basically what's going on here.
[03:08:26.525 --> 03:08:34.667]  You've got the leftist YouTubers saying, kill president, kill me, kill the NRA, burn Daniel Osh, murder everybody, kill Scalise, and that's all fine.
[03:08:35.087 --> 03:08:41.149]  And we're just up there going, oh, it was a police stand down, and look at all these eyewitnesses saying two shooters, and they banned that and then said something else.
[03:08:41.189 --> 03:08:41.909]  So he popped in.
[03:08:41.929 --> 03:08:47.970]  I appreciate Tim joining us from the Military Arms Channel on YouTube.
[03:08:48.951 --> 03:08:49.671]  It's back for now.
[03:08:50.998 --> 03:08:52.538]  We can click the about there and read all about it.
[03:08:52.578 --> 03:08:54.339]  They've got 680,000 subscribers.
[03:08:55.159 --> 03:08:55.959]  Massive views.
[03:08:56.460 --> 03:08:57.940]  And they just review guns.
[03:08:57.980 --> 03:08:58.940]  They just do basic stuff.
[03:08:58.980 --> 03:08:59.581]  People like it.
[03:09:00.061 --> 03:09:01.181]  And you know, we have a right to guns.
[03:09:01.221 --> 03:09:02.441]  We have a right to watch people with guns.
[03:09:02.461 --> 03:09:03.242]  Look at Hollywood.
[03:09:03.522 --> 03:09:04.622]  Shows how to misuse guns.
[03:09:04.642 --> 03:09:05.342]  But they're okay.
[03:09:05.362 --> 03:09:08.443]  Nobody's saying... Imagine walking into a movie theater that shows guns being shot.
[03:09:08.683 --> 03:09:10.964]  You know, some stupid Arnold Schwarzenegger movie or whatever.
[03:09:11.004 --> 03:09:13.845]  Like, I demand this movie be shut down for hate!
[03:09:14.145 --> 03:09:15.105]  They're showing guns!
[03:09:15.145 --> 03:09:16.926]  This is showing how to properly use a gun.
[03:09:17.546 --> 03:09:19.828]  Think about the magnitude of this censorship.
[03:09:19.848 --> 03:09:27.994]  So he joins us for the seven minutes we have, because I've commandeered the time here from the great Joel Gilbert, who's coming up in a moment, normally hosts this hour on Friday.
[03:09:28.935 --> 03:09:29.935]  What is your take on this?
[03:09:29.995 --> 03:09:31.016]  Why do you think it happened?
[03:09:31.376 --> 03:09:35.700]  And then some of our channels that got restored, they didn't even say that we won our appeal.
[03:09:35.740 --> 03:09:36.620]  They just restored them.
[03:09:37.261 --> 03:09:38.121]  This is a big deal.
[03:09:38.181 --> 03:09:43.245]  It sounds like a mutiny happened of leftists at Google, like an internal hack or something.
[03:09:43.365 --> 03:09:43.926]  This is crazy.
[03:09:45.188 --> 03:10:02.939]  Yeah, you know what Alex, it's kind of hard to kind of figure out what exactly is going on because Google is so tight-lipped, but what we do know is because they've actually admitted to it publicly, is that they have targeted conservative speech, and they have targeted firearms channels, and that's of course where my domain is.
[03:10:03.019 --> 03:10:04.360]  I just talk about firearms.
[03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:06.642]  I don't even really review firearms.
[03:10:06.702 --> 03:10:11.648]  I just take them out and show historic firearms, shoot them, have fun, and show the safe, responsible use of firearms.
[03:10:11.688 --> 03:10:14.091]  But I'm constantly being targeted by YouTube.
[03:10:14.131 --> 03:10:15.653]  But I'm also quite politically active.
[03:10:16.534 --> 03:10:19.838]  Whenever our Second Amendment rights come under attack, I go political.
[03:10:19.898 --> 03:10:24.384]  I go political on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, pretty much all of my social media outlets.
[03:10:24.984 --> 03:10:38.301]  But in this instance, I read an article that Google had contracted with the Southern Poverty Law Center to hire 10,000 moderators to go through and clean up the hate speech, or what they're calling the fake news.
[03:10:39.203 --> 03:10:41.125]  And somehow we got caught up in this web.
[03:10:42.504 --> 03:10:54.398]  It's really unclear if it's a coordinated attack by Moms Demand Action and Everytown Matters because we do know that these guys have private Facebook groups and they coordinate attacks against us on Facebook to try to get our pages taken down.
[03:10:54.718 --> 03:10:56.280]  We've caught them doing it multiple times.
[03:10:56.681 --> 03:10:58.262]  Is that what's happening here at YouTube?
[03:10:58.623 --> 03:11:00.485]  We don't know, but what I can tell you is
[03:11:02.747 --> 03:11:07.170]  48 hours ago, my channel was one strike away from being completely shut down.
[03:11:07.630 --> 03:11:15.995]  And so I went in through my account, my network rep, and disabled every single video on my channel and released one video saying, guys, this is what's happening.
[03:11:16.015 --> 03:11:17.876]  YouTube is targeting gun channels right now.
[03:11:18.456 --> 03:11:19.837]  And this was over a weekend.
[03:11:19.857 --> 03:11:22.538]  There was nobody at YouTube we could contact to try to get it resolved.
[03:11:23.019 --> 03:11:27.221]  And it took me until 48 hours ago to get those account strikes lifted.
[03:11:28.303 --> 03:11:29.484]  I had one night of peace.
[03:11:29.905 --> 03:11:39.996]  I wake up the next morning, and I have that pink page of death that says, uh, you've been given account strikes again on the exact same videos they just lifted the strikes against.
[03:11:40.877 --> 03:11:42.980]  And so, it's kind of amazing.
[03:11:44.696 --> 03:11:47.317]  I should be coming from within YouTube to a degree.
[03:11:47.337 --> 03:11:52.738]  And I say this because when I got my first account strike, I immediately disabled all my videos.
[03:11:52.778 --> 03:11:57.340]  The only people that could see my videos at that point were myself and YouTube.
[03:11:57.460 --> 03:12:00.721]  Even if you had a link to one of my disabled videos, you should not view it.
[03:12:01.061 --> 03:12:08.025]  Tim, if you read the Bloomberg and their articles, it says they hired them and YouTube said it was mistakenly done by their employees.
[03:12:08.405 --> 03:12:12.307]  But the truth is, they're just ignoring the brass, hoping they don't notice.
[03:12:12.347 --> 03:12:13.908]  That's why this is mutiny.
[03:12:13.968 --> 03:12:14.848]  This is big news.
[03:12:15.068 --> 03:12:20.791]  Because I understand from on top, Google wants to quietly censor everybody and kind of restrict this and play games.
[03:12:20.811 --> 03:12:25.974]  But I'm saying they've gotten overzealous, jumped the shark, and that's now blown their whole operation wide open.
[03:12:27.102 --> 03:12:30.547]  It has, and not only that, they say that they're fixing it, but they're not.
[03:12:30.687 --> 03:12:36.855]  I mean, they fixed it for me for 48 hours, they go right back and strike my account again, and now I'm fighting again for my very existence on YouTube.
[03:12:37.196 --> 03:12:39.178]  And this is how I make a living, right?
[03:12:39.659 --> 03:12:41.161]  And that's how a lot of us make livings.
[03:12:42.022 --> 03:12:42.482]  We're good to go.
[03:13:04.045 --> 03:13:04.585]  Yeah, it is.
[03:13:04.625 --> 03:13:07.147]  I mean, really, you touched on a very key point there.
[03:13:08.207 --> 03:13:10.669]  We all have signed the same agreement with YouTube.
[03:13:10.749 --> 03:13:12.970]  Millions of us all have the same contract with YouTube.
[03:13:13.350 --> 03:13:14.151]  But for some reason,
[03:13:14.938 --> 03:13:23.063]  YouTube leaves up videos of two-year-olds giving transvestite men money at strip clubs in bizarre stuff and then Prager University is completely milquetoast and scientific and totally polite and they were banning them.
[03:13:23.083 --> 03:13:23.264]  Exactly.
[03:13:23.304 --> 03:13:23.544]  It's crazy.
[03:13:45.779 --> 03:13:46.079]  It is.
[03:13:46.299 --> 03:13:48.000]  It's all politically motivated.
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:49.001]  I mean, we know that.
[03:13:49.501 --> 03:13:50.862]  And they've admitted as much.
[03:13:51.202 --> 03:14:03.890]  And if you go and look at the Chief Business Officer, one of the executives, he recently did an interview with another large YouTuber, and he is from the Czech Republic, I forget his name, but he said that there's four core principles that YouTube lives by.
[03:14:04.211 --> 03:14:08.413]  Freedom of speech, freedom of community, and freedom for everybody to be treated equally and to earn a living.
[03:14:08.834 --> 03:14:09.054]  Really?
[03:14:09.614 --> 03:14:13.516]  Then why is it for the last two years I've been fighting for my very existence on YouTube?
[03:14:13.536 --> 03:14:15.496]  This isn't the first time this has happened, Alex.
[03:14:15.776 --> 03:14:17.017]  They constantly harass us.
[03:14:17.057 --> 03:14:18.077]  They demonetize us.
[03:14:18.417 --> 03:14:21.038]  Every video we upload, they won't monetize us.
[03:14:21.378 --> 03:14:23.219]  We went through the whole adpocalypse right now.
[03:14:23.619 --> 03:14:28.341]  We've had 70% of our revenue taken away, some claim 90%, and it's never come back.
[03:14:28.821 --> 03:14:33.504]  Yeah, no, they did 96% on us for a while, and then it hurt them so bad they went back to like 70.
[03:14:33.625 --> 03:14:38.068]  Absolutely, this is what they're doing, and you're totally on target.
[03:14:38.108 --> 03:14:40.329]  So, why do you think they had to reverse?
[03:14:40.369 --> 03:14:42.951]  Because it became a big national issue with drugs exposing it and things?
[03:14:43.912 --> 03:14:44.352]  I think so.
[03:14:44.412 --> 03:14:46.834]  I think, you know, of course I have my own law filing.
[03:14:46.854 --> 03:14:49.616]  The firearms community as a whole is very vocal.
[03:14:49.696 --> 03:14:51.037]  So everybody got pissed off?
[03:14:51.863 --> 03:15:03.716]  Right, and I even told my followers, here's the phone number, here's the email address, blow up their phone lines, blow up their inbox, and we pressure Google and then they have to come out and say, oops guys, sorry, we made a mistake, but then they turn right around and do it again.
[03:15:03.736 --> 03:15:06.199]  Tim, don't we need to start demonstrating?
[03:15:06.259 --> 03:15:09.683]  I think we need to have on-the-street demonstrations against Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[03:15:10.928 --> 03:15:11.409]  I think so.
[03:15:11.629 --> 03:15:17.834]  I think it's time that we start applying pressure to them because we can't just sit silently by when they treat us differently.
[03:15:17.854 --> 03:15:19.836]  And you point out a very key point, Alex.
[03:15:20.216 --> 03:15:30.946]  We have a contract that we're all working under, but legally, how can you treat one party differently than the other when you have the exact same verbiage and you've all agreed to the exact same terms of use and community guidelines?
[03:15:31.406 --> 03:15:35.849]  Why are you targeting one group and discriminating against them, yet saying this is okay?
[03:15:35.909 --> 03:15:41.973]  My six-year-old son can get on Google and type in, um, putting on a condom, and it's just straight-up pornography, and that's allowed on Google.
[03:15:42.613 --> 03:15:43.053]  On YouTube.
[03:15:44.234 --> 03:15:45.235]  It's unbelievable.
[03:15:45.717 --> 03:15:47.859]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[03:15:47.879 --> 03:15:50.202]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:16:10.265 --> 03:16:11.346]  It just gets old, man.
[03:16:11.687 --> 03:16:13.408]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:16:14.109 --> 03:16:16.171]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:16:16.431 --> 03:16:20.435]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:16:20.455 --> 03:16:22.938]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:16:23.759 --> 03:16:26.081]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:16:26.441 --> 03:16:27.542]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:16:27.803 --> 03:16:28.683]  Us being shut down?
[03:16:28.924 --> 03:16:29.945]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:16:30.365 --> 03:16:31.426]  You know what, Alex?
[03:16:31.466 --> 03:16:32.567]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[03:16:32.827 --> 03:16:33.367]  Hey, Frank!
[03:16:33.668 --> 03:16:39.012]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:16:39.332 --> 03:16:43.615]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:16:43.835 --> 03:16:46.718]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:16:46.978 --> 03:16:47.358]  You understand?
[03:16:47.438 --> 03:16:48.719]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:50.200]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:16:51.201 --> 03:16:56.107]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:17:06.078 --> 03:17:07.119]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[03:17:07.339 --> 03:17:10.781]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[03:17:11.001 --> 03:17:12.422]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[03:17:12.442 --> 03:17:13.242]  They're suing me.
[03:17:13.502 --> 03:17:14.723]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[03:17:15.163 --> 03:17:16.864]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[03:17:16.884 --> 03:17:18.365]  We were bringing $5 million in a year.
[03:17:18.625 --> 03:17:19.606]  It cost a lot to run this.
[03:17:19.766 --> 03:17:21.647]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[03:17:21.887 --> 03:17:23.488]  I keep growing more as fast as I can.
[03:17:23.848 --> 03:17:26.629]  And as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[03:17:26.930 --> 03:17:28.470]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[03:17:28.510 --> 03:17:29.071]  Tell him right there.
[03:17:29.111 --> 03:17:29.351]  Frank!
[03:17:29.631 --> 03:17:30.191]  Hey, Frank!
[03:17:30.451 --> 03:17:31.692]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[03:17:32.112 --> 03:17:35.793]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention.
[03:17:35.833 --> 03:17:37.314]  Although, of course, everybody likes a little bit of attention.
[03:17:37.354 --> 03:17:37.694]  It's nice.
[03:17:37.894 --> 03:17:48.197]  But I can't do TV, and I can't do radio, and I can't publish books, and I can't sell anything, and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[03:17:48.318 --> 03:17:48.938]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:17:48.998 --> 03:17:51.078]  Using every resource at their disposal.
[03:17:51.118 --> 03:17:52.339]  So it's not bragging.
[03:17:52.459 --> 03:17:54.960]  It's a daily reality, and that's why you've got to support things like InfoWars and...
[03:17:55.620 --> 03:17:57.801]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[03:17:57.821 --> 03:17:58.341]  We're doing it now.
[03:17:58.421 --> 03:17:59.541]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:59.581 --> 03:18:00.321]  Go get a t-shirt.
[03:18:00.361 --> 03:18:00.701]  Get a book.

[03:18:17.628 --> 03:18:18.249]  We're fighting!
[03:18:18.509 --> 03:18:19.851]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[03:18:19.911 --> 03:18:24.178]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.
[03:18:24.498 --> 03:18:27.983]  If you make examples of us and fund us, we will be victorious and you win.
[03:18:28.003 --> 03:18:28.765]  Do you understand?
[03:18:28.785 --> 03:18:29.986]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:18:31.172 --> 03:18:35.916]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globals, but they're striking back all over the world.

[03:20:57.128 --> 03:20:59.470]  All right, Joel knows we host the fourth hour on Fridays.
[03:20:59.490 --> 03:21:07.215]  He does a fabulous job, great production, great material, great research, great mind, great filmmaker, that we commandeer sometimes in emergencies, and we've done that today.
[03:21:07.635 --> 03:21:09.877]  He's welcome to come back during the war room and catch up on the time, too.
[03:21:09.897 --> 03:21:11.038]  He's about to take over in about two minutes.
[03:21:11.058 --> 03:21:16.622]  He's got a big guest coming up as well, but we're in the middle of the, I keep saying 24, 36, I'm telephoning for free.
[03:21:16.682 --> 03:21:25.508]  It's a 34-hour broadcast, and there is three and a half hours roughly left, three hours and 39 minutes or however it works.
[03:21:25.548 --> 03:21:26.549]  The point is, is that
[03:21:27.679 --> 03:21:34.305]  We are in the middle of a free speech emergency transmission that I set up to do last week because I knew this stuff was coming and here we are.
[03:21:34.486 --> 03:21:35.707]  It has gotten crazy.
[03:21:36.488 --> 03:21:43.354]  With YouTube channels up, YouTube channels down, thousands of them deleted, Facebook, Twitter, huge Christian channels being banned everywhere.
[03:21:45.433 --> 03:21:47.994]  You were in front of each other earlier, and he's usually more optimistic.
[03:21:48.414 --> 03:21:48.894]  He agreed.
[03:21:48.934 --> 03:21:51.115]  He said, this is 50 times anything we've ever seen.
[03:21:51.175 --> 03:21:56.476]  I mean, this is a bonkers purge, and you better believe it goes with other stuff they're planning.
[03:21:56.516 --> 03:21:58.497]  So I want to get Gilbert's take on that, and he's going to take over.
[03:21:59.577 --> 03:22:06.379]  Just remember, you're the reason we can weather the storm like a seawall or like a lighthouse out there in the storm.
[03:22:06.999 --> 03:22:09.440]  With the waves coming in, you are what strengthens us.
[03:22:09.480 --> 03:22:10.981]  You're what makes us a big steel
[03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:14.501]  Steel pillar in that fight.
[03:22:14.661 --> 03:22:15.962]  You are what renews us.
[03:22:16.022 --> 03:22:17.283]  You're the only reason we're here.
[03:22:17.743 --> 03:22:19.605]  The great guests, the research, all of it.
[03:22:19.645 --> 03:22:20.846]  So don't ever call and thank me.
[03:22:21.306 --> 03:22:23.608]  The Lizards have finally gotten this and are stopping thanking me.
[03:22:24.128 --> 03:22:24.929]  Because it's obscene.
[03:22:27.511 --> 03:22:29.672]  We're going to be totally enslaved if we don't fight these people.
[03:22:29.692 --> 03:22:30.533]  This is authoritarianism.
[03:22:30.573 --> 03:22:31.373]  This is survival.
[03:22:32.034 --> 03:22:37.238]  If my house is on fire and I was running out of it with my kids, don't run up and say, oh man, you guys are so brave.
[03:22:38.238 --> 03:22:38.959]  I'm so brave.
[03:22:39.599 --> 03:22:40.120]  It's not
[03:22:41.425 --> 03:22:42.786]  Brave to fight for your life.
[03:22:43.806 --> 03:22:57.594]  And I keep saying that because we have to get a mindset where it's not a Joel Gilbert, and it's not a Ron Paul, or it's not a Donald Trump, or it's not a Matt Drudge, or a Joseph Farah, or whoever, Sean Hannity, anybody that's speaking up for basic freedom.
[03:22:57.634 --> 03:23:00.236]  It's not like, oh, it's just us that are doing it, and thank God we're there.
[03:23:00.796 --> 03:23:03.918]  We're this close to total victory and this close to total defeat.
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.321]  And so, you got free shipping store-wide.
[03:23:07.462 --> 03:23:08.642]  People love those big sales.
[03:23:09.243 --> 03:23:10.944]  Our products are only 100% marked up.
[03:23:11.424 --> 03:23:13.565]  So when we do 30% off, we're making 20%.
[03:23:14.806 --> 03:23:18.428]  When we do 80%, it's a lost leader.
[03:23:18.769 --> 03:23:20.470]  And by the way, I'm proud of all the stuff we've got.
[03:23:20.490 --> 03:23:21.350]  We've never done 80% off.
[03:23:21.370 --> 03:23:23.512]  We've got some things, thousands of shirts and things.
[03:23:23.832 --> 03:23:27.134]  We've ordered so many shirts that for some reason we didn't promote or weren't put on the right page.
[03:23:27.414 --> 03:23:28.035]  People didn't see.
[03:23:28.875 --> 03:23:33.238]  Here's more than 20 awesome shirts in there and ball caps, you name it, that are very limited edition.
[03:23:34.798 --> 03:23:38.800]  In many cases, and that are 80% off.
[03:23:38.840 --> 03:23:42.781]  That means, you know, if a shirt cost us $5, $6, we're selling it for $20.
[03:23:43.141 --> 03:23:44.742]  At 80% off, you're getting it below cost.
[03:23:44.762 --> 03:23:46.022]  These are great shirts, so look at that.
[03:23:47.063 --> 03:23:50.824]  But we got a lot of stuff that flies off the shelves, like Super Mel Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[03:23:51.364 --> 03:23:52.745]  50% off, that is a rarity.
[03:23:53.125 --> 03:23:55.226]  Pollen Block, it was sold out, now back in stock.
[03:23:55.306 --> 03:23:58.207]  Amazing, found out why it's so unique and so documented.
[03:23:58.907 --> 03:23:59.528]  Pollen Block's 50% off.
[03:24:00.962 --> 03:24:02.042]  Immune wall, 50% off.
[03:24:02.203 --> 03:24:03.263]  Real Red Pill, 50% off.
[03:24:03.283 --> 03:24:04.383]  Biome Defense, 50% off.
[03:24:04.423 --> 03:24:06.004]  Great Probiotic, 3-Way, 50% off.
[03:24:06.044 --> 03:24:07.505]  Prebiotic Fiber, that's our newest product.
[03:24:07.585 --> 03:24:08.065]  Check it out.
[03:24:08.245 --> 03:24:11.026]  Best Source Prebiotic Fiber, 50% off.
[03:24:11.086 --> 03:24:14.247]  InfoWare Select, 5 products, 40% off.
[03:24:14.287 --> 03:24:15.828]  Clearance Apparel, 80% off.
[03:24:16.168 --> 03:24:17.528]  Aegis Body Armor, 20% off.
[03:24:17.949 --> 03:24:19.489]  Man, you guys have really come through.
[03:24:19.589 --> 03:24:20.610]  We really appreciate everybody.
[03:24:20.650 --> 03:24:26.512]  We want to thank you for all that you've done and just want to ask you to continue to realize we got products you need.
[03:24:26.852 --> 03:24:27.753]  Okay, thank you so much, Alex.
[03:24:50.077 --> 03:24:54.820]  Look, what you're talking about, of course, is not a deep state.
[03:24:55.340 --> 03:24:58.122]  The term deep state badly missed the mark.
[03:24:58.182 --> 03:25:00.343]  The conservative media used the term deep state.
[03:25:01.204 --> 03:25:03.125]  The reality is police state.
[03:25:03.985 --> 03:25:08.908]  Deep state simply means an entrenched bureaucracy, self-serving people that are opposed to change.
[03:25:09.589 --> 03:25:15.172]  And the dark reality that was a subversion of democracy that Obama set in place from the get-go
[03:25:16.520 --> 03:25:20.164]  Is a police state and we see it being done by his minions.
[03:25:20.224 --> 03:25:27.332]  I want to define for you the proper term, by the way, the definition of a police state is going to read it to you.
[03:25:27.372 --> 03:25:36.862]  The inhabitants of a police state experience restrictions on their freedom of expression to communicate their political views and are subject to monitoring and enforcement.
[03:25:37.549 --> 03:25:44.351]  Political control may be exerted by a secret force that operates outside the boundaries of the normal constitutional state.
[03:25:44.951 --> 03:25:51.653]  So we experienced that from Barack Obama in 2012 when they interfered in the election with the IRS.
[03:25:52.313 --> 03:25:57.915]  We experienced it, of course, with the DOJ and FBI interfering in the 2016 election.
[03:25:58.715 --> 03:26:05.177]  And we're experiencing it these days with their minions in YouTube and the people that control the means of expression.
[03:26:06.764 --> 03:26:08.725]  Preventing conservatives from communicating.
[03:26:09.846 --> 03:26:16.070]  The deep state is a police state apparatus and that is the sad reality.
[03:26:16.730 --> 03:26:26.236]  Had Hillary Clinton won, the United States would have been finished and we would have had a permanent police state and we're still fighting against it as we speak.
[03:26:26.876 --> 03:26:27.817]  Joel, I've got to interrupt.
[03:26:27.877 --> 03:26:28.457]  I was about to leave.
[03:26:28.477 --> 03:26:29.378]  This is so profound.
[03:26:29.398 --> 03:26:29.798]  You're right.
[03:26:30.299 --> 03:26:33.921]  Deep State's the old COG for an emergency nuclear war type deal.
[03:26:34.321 --> 03:26:39.665]  It's police state entrenched in a deep state structure that are trying to bully us into submission.
[03:26:39.705 --> 03:26:44.508]  And they always spin, when I talk about a police state under Clinton and others, that I was anti-police.
[03:26:44.568 --> 03:26:49.512]  No, a police state means a tyranny controlling your speech, controlling your mood, but controlling your life.
[03:26:49.772 --> 03:26:55.756]  And that's what the big corporations and combines and the leftist mobs and Antifa and Black Lives Matter are.
[03:26:56.396 --> 03:26:58.177]  That's correct.
[03:26:58.197 --> 03:27:08.900]  The deep state term, I think we need to throw it out.
[03:27:09.260 --> 03:27:15.362]  It really didn't describe what we're up against and we saw it in the last few days how all these YouTube channels were subverted.
[03:27:15.742 --> 03:27:23.224]  There's a nexus between the police state and their economic interests like Google, YouTube, Amazon, Washington Post.
[03:27:23.944 --> 03:27:28.167]  And they're trying to impose their will on freedom of speech, freedom of movement.
[03:27:28.748 --> 03:27:31.029]  And all we can do is keep fighting back.
[03:27:31.069 --> 03:27:35.593]  I think we won the war the last few days, but it's something that constantly has to be visualized.
[03:27:36.093 --> 03:27:37.094]  It's who wants it the most.
[03:27:37.134 --> 03:27:40.016]  We won this battle so far, you know they're gonna hit again.
[03:27:41.429 --> 03:27:42.350]  You know, they're coming back.
[03:27:43.491 --> 03:27:44.372]  It's just constant.
[03:27:44.412 --> 03:27:46.213]  I mean, I'm here in Southern California.
[03:27:46.233 --> 03:27:56.141]  I'm looking out at the Reagan library from my window, and I always remember those profound words of Ronald Reagan that tyranny is only one generation away.
[03:27:56.882 --> 03:27:57.943]  You have to be vigilant.
[03:27:58.607 --> 03:28:00.888]  And, unfortunately, these people will never stop.
[03:28:00.908 --> 03:28:11.930]  They're always coming back with new excuses, new schemes, new terminology to prevent the Constitutional Republic from thriving and existing.
[03:28:12.711 --> 03:28:15.051]  I'm going to talk about that more as we get into my segment.
[03:28:16.051 --> 03:28:18.212]  Well, I almost wish I wouldn't have commandeered that earlier segment.
[03:28:18.232 --> 03:28:20.692]  It was important to have some of the people that have been banned on.
[03:28:21.493 --> 03:28:23.173]  Why do you think they've backed off so far?
[03:28:23.593 --> 03:28:26.454]  They say it's a mutiny, like their own people got too zealous.
[03:28:28.850 --> 03:28:29.593]  I think the
[03:28:30.757 --> 03:28:37.321]  Look, there's a there's a strong foundation of constitutional people in this country.
[03:28:37.381 --> 03:28:42.363]  There are people, the middle class is very strong and supports the free market system.
[03:28:42.864 --> 03:28:49.807]  And whenever they go too far and they think they've gone too far, they back off a bit because they've got so many schemes in their pocket.
[03:28:49.827 --> 03:28:51.468]  They're waiting to come back with the next one.
[03:28:51.868 --> 03:28:53.309]  So I think that's right.
[03:28:53.329 --> 03:28:54.950]  They're testing and we and we fight.
[03:28:55.010 --> 03:28:56.291]  They back off like guerrilla.
[03:28:56.871 --> 03:28:58.532]  Go right back with Joel Gilbert.
[03:28:58.552 --> 03:28:58.972]  Stay with us.
[03:28:59.072 --> 03:28:59.753]  Riveting Intel.
[03:29:00.888 --> 03:29:01.348]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:29:22.697 --> 03:29:34.825]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:29:35.525 --> 03:29:50.575]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:29:51.576 --> 03:29:55.280]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[03:29:55.841 --> 03:29:57.563]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:29:57.583 --> 03:29:59.826]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:30:04.437 --> 03:30:09.200]  Now, joining us is a best-selling author and researcher, Michael Malice.
[03:30:10.120 --> 03:30:11.161]  MichaelMalice.com.
[03:30:11.201 --> 03:30:14.743]  He grew up behind the Iron Curtain, so he understands the tyranny of collectivism.
[03:30:14.763 --> 03:30:16.344]  He's at Twitter, at Michael Malice.
[03:30:16.424 --> 03:30:20.987]  He's written Dear Reader, Kim Jong-il, and he's been over there and researched it.
[03:30:21.027 --> 03:30:25.130]  So again, Michael Malice, author of The Dear Reader, about North Korea.
[03:30:25.730 --> 03:30:29.152]  Give us your expert take on where we are right now and the chances for war over there.
[03:30:29.532 --> 03:30:31.073]  I talk about this heavily in my book.
[03:30:31.213 --> 03:30:37.297]  If you look at these countries, Libya is a great example, Iraq, and several others.
[03:30:37.437 --> 03:30:42.761]  When the countries liberalized, Romania was the example Kim Jong Il himself used.
[03:30:43.161 --> 03:30:46.643]  When these countries liberalize, very often the people at the top are shot.
[03:30:47.143 --> 03:30:48.024]  And with good reason.
[03:30:48.064 --> 03:30:50.185]  You look at Gaddafi, he was sodomized to death.
[03:30:50.466 --> 03:30:51.746]  Saddam Hussein was hung.
[03:30:52.107 --> 03:30:54.928]  And Libya had a nascent nuclear program.
[03:30:55.269 --> 03:30:56.529]  They agreed to give it up.
[03:30:56.589 --> 03:30:58.711]  And what happened is, right now you have slavery there.
[03:30:59.151 --> 03:31:03.535]  So North Korea very quickly realizes the best defense is a good offense.
[03:31:04.096 --> 03:31:10.422]  Kim Jong-il said he wants to turn the country into a hedgehog, meaning one with nuclear missile spines pointing in every direction.
[03:31:10.843 --> 03:31:12.945]  And if you think about it, how much easier?
[03:31:13.165 --> 03:31:18.850]  I don't think they would have been running their mouths to this point if they didn't have nukes or at least some very, very strong weaponry.
[03:31:19.171 --> 03:31:20.272]  Something would have happened to him.
[03:31:20.772 --> 03:31:23.455]  They are very conniving in their hold on power.
[03:31:23.755 --> 03:31:26.898]  They're very interested in self-preservation.
[03:31:27.198 --> 03:31:35.346]  And unfortunately, it's at the expense of the 25 million North Korean population who are the victims in this horrible decades-long atrocity.
[03:31:35.806 --> 03:31:45.435]  Don't they know that calculus has changed and that the whole strategy of patience and then the globalists using North Korea as a strategy of tension, that that is coming to an end?
[03:31:45.615 --> 03:31:47.737]  It is coming to an end, and they're scared.
[03:31:47.857 --> 03:31:51.921]  And they're clearly scared, and you see that they're reaching out to South Korea, their arch-rival.
[03:31:52.441 --> 03:31:58.147]  In some kind of... China very publicly last year, and in recent months, has been turning their backs on them.
[03:31:58.487 --> 03:32:00.689]  Russia, to some extent, has been turning their backs on them.
[03:32:00.909 --> 03:32:06.214]  You know, Putin liked the idea that North Korea could kind of be a thorn in our side, but even he's not going to be defending.
[03:32:06.514 --> 03:32:06.694]  I think?
[03:32:27.293 --> 03:32:30.854]  Every country is turning their back on the North, and they don't know what to do.
[03:32:30.914 --> 03:32:33.535]  This is kind of uncharted territory for them, thank God.
[03:32:33.575 --> 03:32:40.757]  And I'm not saying this is the end of the North Korean regime, which I pray every day that it is, but if this were the end, this is what the end would look like.
[03:32:40.777 --> 03:32:49.340]  They are a hostage nation of just people who don't even know what planet they're on, and that's why they're the greatest victims, people under communism.
[03:32:49.380 --> 03:32:53.521]  Michael Malice, the book, Dear Reader, available everywhere at Twitter, Michael Malice.
[03:32:53.781 --> 03:32:54.921]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:32:54.961 --> 03:32:55.602]  I appreciate you.
[03:32:56.262 --> 03:32:56.802]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:33:05.902 --> 03:33:10.384]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.766 --> 03:33:14.346]  We've got it.
[03:33:14.586 --> 03:33:20.849]  This transmission is coming to you.
[03:33:20.909 --> 03:33:22.990]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:25.291 --> 03:33:30.874]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:35.840 --> 03:33:38.162]  Welcome back to InfoWars, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:38.242 --> 03:33:41.464]  I'm Joel Gilbert, coming to you right from the left coast.
[03:33:42.905 --> 03:33:47.929]  Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones store and get my new film, of course, Art of the Insult.
[03:33:47.969 --> 03:33:53.313]  You'll finally understand Trump, and you'll see his branding genius, and you'll laugh for 95 minutes.
[03:33:54.654 --> 03:33:58.557]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to have Kevin Jackson of the Black Sphere.
[03:33:58.597 --> 03:34:03.040]  You know him as a Fox News commentator, and he's going to give some insights.
[03:34:03.981 --> 03:34:04.962]  I want to first
[03:34:05.822 --> 03:34:08.845]  Give you some of my takes about what's been happening the last couple weeks.
[03:34:10.027 --> 03:34:12.189]  The Parkland shootings.
[03:34:12.329 --> 03:34:15.472]  It's still all about the FBI and competence and corruption.
[03:34:16.513 --> 03:34:20.337]  The FBI has been missing all these shooters, even though they had them under their fingertips.
[03:34:20.378 --> 03:34:24.302]  Dylan Roof, Fort Hood shooter, Nidal Hassan, the Tsarnaev brothers.
[03:34:25.326 --> 03:34:30.549]  The Boston Marathon bombers, of course the Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen.
[03:34:30.969 --> 03:34:33.610]  They investigated this guy for like two years.
[03:34:34.110 --> 03:34:36.831]  They said, oh no problem, just go about your business.
[03:34:37.632 --> 03:34:46.956]  Now, what are the odds that the FBI was not all over Steven Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, and that's why they cut off all the information?
[03:34:47.476 --> 03:34:48.697]  Because heads would have rolled.
[03:34:48.737 --> 03:34:53.119]  You think maybe the FBI is covering up something that they had a connection to Paddock?
[03:34:53.911 --> 03:34:54.932]  Where's the videotape?
[03:34:54.952 --> 03:34:56.373]  The hotel videotape?
[03:34:56.633 --> 03:34:57.974]  All the information was cut off.
[03:34:58.915 --> 03:35:04.580]  So the FBI still has the chutzpah to tell us, if you see something, say something.
[03:35:05.340 --> 03:35:07.902]  It's completely useless, completely irrelevant.
[03:35:08.443 --> 03:35:13.827]  The best slogan we can live by is, be prepared to protect yourself.
[03:35:14.728 --> 03:35:18.651]  Have a weapon, because the FBI or police are just going to wait outside.
[03:35:19.266 --> 03:35:22.689]  They're making a big deal about Parkland that four deputies waited outside.
[03:35:23.250 --> 03:35:31.897]  People forget that in the Pulse nightclub shooting, the entire SWAT team set up outside for three hours while everybody who had been shot bled to death.
[03:35:34.039 --> 03:35:36.301]  So how would you like to live?
[03:35:36.341 --> 03:35:45.730]  Either have some people on the inside, like a school where there's a few teachers with weapons, or have the people with the weapons that are supposed to save you hanging out outside.
[03:35:47.363 --> 03:35:50.105]  I want to talk to you about the Parkland Promise Program.
[03:35:51.486 --> 03:35:56.349]  We're learning a lot about Broward County's very deadly Promise Program.
[03:35:57.570 --> 03:36:01.093]  This is why Nicholas Cruz was not arrested.
[03:36:01.573 --> 03:36:09.399]  Like so many other liberal social engineering projects, rather than saving the world, it is proving to be very deadly.
[03:36:10.099 --> 03:36:15.343]  Now on the website, the Promise Program for Broward County calls for change and intervention.
[03:36:16.346 --> 03:36:19.347]  And it says they're not going to arrest teenagers for crimes.
[03:36:19.828 --> 03:36:26.691]  Essentially, they're whitewashing their behavior and sending them back to school into the community to commit more crimes.
[03:36:27.371 --> 03:36:29.892]  Here's the quote from the Broward County Sheriff website.
[03:36:29.912 --> 03:36:31.853]  This is the promise.
[03:36:31.893 --> 03:36:35.774]  The promise is to safeguard the student from entering the judicial system.
[03:36:36.815 --> 03:36:41.137]  Well, well, well, what about safeguarding the public from the criminal?
[03:36:41.597 --> 03:36:42.417]  How did it work out?
[03:36:42.437 --> 03:36:42.897]  17 dead students.
[03:36:44.782 --> 03:36:46.223]  One is going to jail for life.
[03:36:47.224 --> 03:36:48.165]  What would have been better?
[03:36:49.146 --> 03:36:55.030]  Now, then there's a quote also on their website, eliminating the school to prison pipeline.
[03:36:55.811 --> 03:37:00.255]  Broward County is committed to keeping students engaged in school and out of the justice system.
[03:37:01.296 --> 03:37:02.056]  Well, how about this?
[03:37:02.096 --> 03:37:03.037]  Let's have a new slogan.
[03:37:03.357 --> 03:37:09.342]  We promise to let you commit as many crimes as you want until you or your classmates end up dead.
[03:37:10.643 --> 03:37:14.026]  That's the real promise they made to Nicholas Cruz and the community.
[03:37:14.699 --> 03:37:18.280]  That's how Trayvon Martin lost his life in a similar program.
[03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:21.461]  He was not held accountable for many crimes.
[03:37:22.021 --> 03:37:32.825]  They stopped arresting students, and it eventually led to the confrontation with George Zimmerman, where he had a weapon to defend himself, and Trayvon is dead because of these types of programs.
[03:37:33.545 --> 03:37:42.268]  So, the Promise Program, I want to give perspective, it's just the same social engineering by these utopian geniuses, these big thinkers.
[03:37:43.055 --> 03:37:48.459]  On the socialist part of the world that believe they know how human nature should be.
[03:37:49.540 --> 03:37:50.701]  Remember Mao Zedong?
[03:37:51.321 --> 03:37:55.644]  He said we're going to put all these farmers in collective farms and they're going to produce more food.
[03:37:55.664 --> 03:37:56.645]  They're going to be happier.
[03:37:57.305 --> 03:37:59.907]  They just don't know it until we force them onto these farms.
[03:38:00.728 --> 03:38:02.049]  That caused the Great Famine.
[03:38:02.069 --> 03:38:04.851]  50 million Chinese people starved to death.
[03:38:05.743 --> 03:38:15.469]  Of course, here in America, in Detroit, the Democrats were controlling Detroit for 60 years, the greatest American city with all the jobs and great economy, industry.
[03:38:16.230 --> 03:38:17.811]  Mayor Coleman Young was a socialist.
[03:38:17.831 --> 03:38:23.735]  The idea was, let's raise taxes, put all these regulations on business, and it's going to work out just great.
[03:38:24.595 --> 03:38:28.938]  Well, all the businesses left, and Detroit turned into a disaster.
[03:38:29.873 --> 03:38:36.235]  So with Nicholas Cruz, we know that he got expelled for having, quote, bullets in his backpack.
[03:38:37.376 --> 03:38:44.219]  Well, you think maybe he had a handgun and they just downgraded it to bullets so he wouldn't be arrested?
[03:38:44.279 --> 03:38:45.659]  I think that's probably what happened.
[03:38:46.359 --> 03:38:49.060]  Liberal social engineering is a disaster.
[03:38:49.621 --> 03:38:50.981]  It's always been a disaster.
[03:38:51.541 --> 03:38:52.302]  But they don't give up.
[03:38:52.362 --> 03:38:53.122]  They just say, well,
[03:38:54.275 --> 03:38:55.857]  It's going to work out great next time.
[03:38:55.917 --> 03:38:57.238]  You know the VA hospitals?
[03:38:57.879 --> 03:39:00.001]  Yeah, well, we're going to have the Affordable Care Act.
[03:39:00.361 --> 03:39:02.243]  You're going to save $5,000 per family.
[03:39:02.724 --> 03:39:06.447]  You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, and it's not going to work out like the VA.
[03:39:06.487 --> 03:39:07.548]  It's just going to be great.
[03:39:08.409 --> 03:39:16.077]  So the bottom line is the socialist, liberalist ideologues, they actually know that none of this is going to work out.
[03:39:16.966 --> 03:39:18.366]  But they thrive on chaos.
[03:39:18.507 --> 03:39:27.009]  If everything is peaceful and good, if people go to church, they earn a good living, they love their country, there's no justification for radical change.
[03:39:27.810 --> 03:39:37.473]  They have to create this chaos through all these schemes so they can say, well give us the power, we'll fix the chaos that we created, and we'll make it right for you.
[03:39:38.353 --> 03:39:41.274]  And that's how evil some of these schemes are.
[03:39:41.334 --> 03:39:44.035]  They cause intentional harm, they know will cause damage,
[03:39:44.835 --> 03:39:50.401]  They would rather Nicholas Cruz not be arrested and say, let's say he's got bullets in his backpack.
[03:39:50.421 --> 03:39:51.663]  Don't talk about the handgun.
[03:39:52.904 --> 03:39:58.770]  And they know that he'll create the chaos they can use one day to to usurp the Constitutional Republic.
[03:39:59.691 --> 03:40:01.293]  I want to show a video from my film.
[03:40:01.313 --> 03:40:02.655]  There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:40:03.422 --> 03:40:16.105]  It's called The Weight of the Poor, and it shows you how today's Democratic Party is trying to bring down the constitutional, traditional American republic and replace it with this socialist ideal.
[03:40:16.745 --> 03:40:17.565]  Can we roll that video?
[03:40:25.487 --> 03:40:31.668]  So here you've got these communists are trying to overburden the system.
[03:40:33.309 --> 03:40:35.590]  They use poor people, they use minorities.
[03:40:37.451 --> 03:40:40.512]  They want to create a system that can't be sustained.
[03:40:44.354 --> 03:40:48.876]  And by overburdening it, they want to collapse the system.
[03:40:49.016 --> 03:40:50.837]  This is the Cloward-Piven Theory.
[03:40:51.957 --> 03:40:53.578]  And they did it to New York in the 70s.
[03:40:53.658 --> 03:40:57.840]  They bankrupted New York with this process.
[03:40:58.060 --> 03:41:00.721]  The idea is if they can collapse the system, they can replace it.
[03:41:02.045 --> 03:41:04.066]  It's this perfect society, this perfect world.
[03:41:13.011 --> 03:41:18.133]  Now, this is how you can see that the Democrat Party wants to sow chaos.
[03:41:18.173 --> 03:41:20.214]  They became a radical socialist party.
[03:41:20.915 --> 03:41:27.058]  Compared to the 1980s, the Democrats worked with Ronald Reagan to implement huge tax reform and tax cuts.
[03:41:28.018 --> 03:41:30.099]  Today, the Democrats, 100% together,
[03:41:32.245 --> 03:41:35.267]  They knew that if America succeeds, they will fail.
[03:41:35.427 --> 03:41:37.088]  So they all voted against the tax cuts.
[03:41:37.648 --> 03:41:41.170]  They know that if America works, that they lose power.
[03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:46.813]  So they're out to stop Donald Trump at all costs, even at the cost of their constituents.
[03:41:47.734 --> 03:41:58.660]  And that's why you see little Adam Schiff lying every day on TV about how Trump is going to be impeached and all these innuendos that he puts forth.
[03:41:59.341 --> 03:41:59.481]  So
[03:42:00.345 --> 03:42:01.966]  This is today's Democrat Party.
[03:42:02.106 --> 03:42:03.307]  It's stealth socialism.
[03:42:04.348 --> 03:42:07.751]  It's not the open calls for communism and destroying the Republic.
[03:42:08.851 --> 03:42:10.352]  They don't say, we want to kill you anymore.
[03:42:10.392 --> 03:42:11.553]  They say, we want to help you.
[03:42:12.394 --> 03:42:23.662]  And the way we're going to help you is by taking away all your rights and making the promise program for Nicholas Cruz so he only has bullets in his backpack.
[03:42:24.763 --> 03:42:25.824]  This is where we are today.
[03:42:26.747 --> 03:42:34.658]  And if you look closely at everything we've talked about earlier with Alex, the deep state is a police state.
[03:42:35.359 --> 03:42:37.902]  And these are the types of schemes that go on.
[03:42:39.905 --> 03:42:42.428]  I'll be back with Kevin Jackson in the next segment.

[03:45:03.470 --> 03:45:07.913]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:45:08.134 --> 03:45:12.837]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:45:13.438 --> 03:45:19.282]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:45:19.702 --> 03:45:32.312]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:45:33.052 --> 03:45:41.743]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:45:41.763 --> 03:45:43.665]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:45:43.985 --> 03:45:45.147]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:45:45.167 --> 03:45:46.408]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:45:46.588 --> 03:45:47.790]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:49.470]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:45:49.970 --> 03:45:51.611]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:45:51.931 --> 03:45:53.391]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:45:53.731 --> 03:45:56.352]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:45:56.392 --> 03:45:57.252]  This is insane.
[03:45:57.652 --> 03:45:59.272]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:45:59.532 --> 03:46:02.073]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:46:02.533 --> 03:46:04.053]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:46:04.093 --> 03:46:05.914]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:46:05.934 --> 03:46:07.794]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:46:08.654 --> 03:46:14.576]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:46:14.836 --> 03:46:16.176]  All just moderate dose.
[03:46:17.705 --> 03:46:25.695]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:46:25.715 --> 03:46:28.018]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:28.118 --> 03:46:29.299]  But thank you for committing.

[03:46:36.567 --> 03:46:39.169]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:43.953]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:46:44.413 --> 03:46:50.558]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:46:50.578 --> 03:46:53.680]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:46:54.041 --> 03:46:55.342]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:47:05.932 --> 03:47:08.548]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.763 --> 03:47:36.866]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:47:37.266 --> 03:47:41.147]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:41.187 --> 03:47:42.768]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:42.848 --> 03:47:46.189]  I'm Joel Gilbert from the left coast right here.
[03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:48.890]  Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones Store only.
[03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:52.992]  Go to the Alex Jones Store for my new film, Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:47:53.392 --> 03:47:56.914]  You won't stop laughing and you'll understand Trump for the first time.
[03:47:57.494 --> 03:48:00.355]  This is a number one film right now in the Alex Jones Store.
[03:48:01.329 --> 03:48:09.416]  I want to bring on now, people know him from Fox News, he's been on quite a few times, he's a fantastic commentator, Kevin Jackson.
[03:48:09.476 --> 03:48:12.338]  He's also a talk show host on Salem Communications.
[03:48:12.919 --> 03:48:21.406]  He's the author of the Amazon bestsellers, The Big Black Lie and Race Pimping, the multi-trillion dollar business of liberalism.
[03:48:23.047 --> 03:48:24.789]  Kevin Jackson, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:48:26.010 --> 03:48:27.151]  Hey Joel, thanks for having me.
[03:48:27.191 --> 03:48:32.497]  Real quick update, I'm with Genesis on the same network as Alex, actually, not Salem.
[03:48:33.418 --> 03:48:34.118]  Okay, thanks.
[03:48:34.158 --> 03:48:35.199]  We got that from your website.
[03:48:35.720 --> 03:48:39.043]  By the way, Kevin's website, TheBlackSphere.net.
[03:48:40.525 --> 03:48:42.266]  Kevin, you've been talking about it for a long time.
[03:48:42.306 --> 03:48:44.629]  You've seen my film, There's No Place Like Utopia, where...
[03:48:45.678 --> 03:48:47.018]  I went to South Side Chicago.
[03:48:47.058 --> 03:48:48.839]  I talked to a lot of black people.
[03:48:49.379 --> 03:48:52.119]  They love Obama because he's one of them.
[03:48:52.639 --> 03:48:54.100]  They're proud of his heritage.
[03:48:54.700 --> 03:48:58.600]  But when I talked to them about his policies, they said, we're getting poorer.
[03:48:58.760 --> 03:49:00.881]  We want more cops, not less cops.
[03:49:01.381 --> 03:49:03.401]  We don't want illegals in our neighborhood.
[03:49:03.861 --> 03:49:05.002]  We want jobs.
[03:49:05.582 --> 03:49:10.082]  They seem to be very conservative, but they're still supporting the Democrats like 90%.
[03:49:11.803 --> 03:49:12.903]  What's happening on that?
[03:49:13.846 --> 03:49:26.216]  I don't think those numbers, look, we've both been there and there are a lot of people that wanted Obama, black folks, and he got in there and he gave it a shot and he blew it.
[03:49:26.336 --> 03:49:30.840]  I mean, he was the Mookie Wilson of baseball, not the Jackie Robinson, and black folks know it.
[03:49:34.062 --> 03:49:36.584]  You know, now look, they've invested a lot in this guy.
[03:49:37.305 --> 03:49:42.129]  And, you know, you can't just throw him to the wolves because that will validate the white man.
[03:49:42.589 --> 03:49:47.133]  And as we know, in America today, you can't do anything that validates white.
[03:49:47.913 --> 03:49:51.096]  Look at Chuck Schumer that doesn't want to vote for a qualified judge.
[03:49:51.196 --> 03:49:51.496]  Why?
[03:49:51.937 --> 03:49:53.037]  Simply because he's white.
[03:49:53.458 --> 03:49:54.959]  It has nothing to do with qualification.
[03:49:55.339 --> 03:49:57.101]  So just the idea that we have this
[03:49:57.641 --> 03:49:58.901]  Overt racism.
[03:49:59.521 --> 03:50:03.262]  And, you know, I heard you talking in the last segment about that sneaky racism.
[03:50:03.322 --> 03:50:04.222]  It's not sneaky.
[03:50:04.542 --> 03:50:05.602]  It's right in your face.
[03:50:06.062 --> 03:50:09.783]  The Congressional Black Caucus makes everything about white versus black.
[03:50:10.603 --> 03:50:11.823]  It's not only that, though.
[03:50:12.083 --> 03:50:13.644]  It's woman versus man.
[03:50:14.024 --> 03:50:16.204]  It's Muslim versus Christian or Jew.
[03:50:16.624 --> 03:50:17.224]  And on and on.
[03:50:17.264 --> 03:50:18.645]  And that's what they do is divide.
[03:50:18.705 --> 03:50:23.725]  So as far as Obama's concerned, look, he's circa 19, circa 2008.
[03:50:25.026 --> 03:50:26.506]  He's last year's news.
[03:50:27.466 --> 03:50:31.151]  And the people that still support him lost his last year's Easter eggs.
[03:50:31.692 --> 03:50:40.723]  And I'm going to tell you, the day of Trump that has exposed Obama for what he is, which is an abject fraud, is long overdue.
[03:50:41.284 --> 03:50:45.209]  The exposure of the Democrats and their racism is long overdue.
[03:50:45.669 --> 03:50:48.351]  Okay, well Kevin, tell me when, what was the exact time, and how do you think
[03:51:06.272 --> 03:51:14.947]  The civil rights movement got away from Martin Luther King's vision of let's judge people by the strength of their character and not by the color of their skin.
[03:51:15.047 --> 03:51:16.450]  How did it all turn around?
[03:51:17.492 --> 03:51:24.116]  You know, it's so strange that we as conservatives have allowed the Republican Party to fight for us.
[03:51:24.616 --> 03:51:27.118]  I mean, we've got a sissy in our fight.
[03:51:27.818 --> 03:51:28.979]  And when did it happen?
[03:51:29.019 --> 03:51:35.583]  It happened in the 60s under LBJ, who, along with the Democrat elite, has decided, you know what?
[03:51:36.044 --> 03:51:41.867]  We will continue to trick black people into believing that we have their best interest in mind.
[03:51:42.187 --> 03:51:44.689]  And that, by the way, that ruse continues to this day.
[03:51:45.413 --> 03:51:58.656]  So, when they set out to do this, it was a real strategy, and just to be blunt, and this may make some people mad, probably not with Alex's audience, but just to be blunt, it was, let's keep black people
[03:52:01.445 --> 03:52:02.185]  Let's flip it.
[03:52:02.205 --> 03:52:03.346]  Let's rewrite history.
[03:52:03.886 --> 03:52:29.477]  And so you've got a party of Republicans who freed black people, wrote almost every civil rights legislation that protected black people, started the NRA to give black people guns, started the Freedmen's Bureau to get black people educated, have all their white Republican names on every HBCU, that's historically black colleges and universities in the country, fought against the Klan, fought against segregation, fought against Jim Crow, etc.
[03:52:30.457 --> 03:52:34.981]  And they can't sell that concept to black people today, because you know what you hear, Joel?
[03:52:35.402 --> 03:52:40.906]  You hear, well, that was the Republicans from the past, and the Democrats have flipped.
[03:52:40.987 --> 03:52:42.188]  You know, everybody's flipped.
[03:52:42.588 --> 03:52:43.389]  Nothing's flipped.
[03:52:43.769 --> 03:52:47.813]  Planned Parenthood is a scourge against black people.
[03:52:47.853 --> 03:52:49.614]  It's very clear what it's meant to do.
[03:52:50.115 --> 03:52:52.597]  It's to keep black people from breeding, right?
[03:52:52.917 --> 03:52:56.060]  And I can give you the statistics around how it has done that.
[03:52:56.621 --> 03:53:02.276]  When you look at the abject racism of Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill,
[03:53:03.090 --> 03:53:08.872]  Giving a eulogy to a Klansman, Robert Byrd, and Democrats saying nothing.
[03:53:08.932 --> 03:53:11.233]  By the way, Barack Obama eulogized him as well.
[03:53:11.273 --> 03:53:14.854]  They all said he had a tangential relationship.
[03:53:14.874 --> 03:53:18.516]  That's exactly what Bill Clinton said, he had a tangential relationship with the Klan.
[03:53:18.536 --> 03:53:21.997]  40 plus years in the Klan is tangential.
[03:53:22.397 --> 03:53:32.061]  Now, tell me that Donald Trump could have a relationship with a 40 plus year Klansman, and everybody just brush it over, and if he eulogized him, how that would be done.
[03:53:32.541 --> 03:53:37.924]  But they tell you it's racist and can't give you anything whatsoever to prove it.
[03:53:38.944 --> 03:53:42.045]  Okay, Kevin, look, Trump made it a point in a campaign.
[03:53:42.085 --> 03:53:43.386]  He went to places like Detroit.
[03:53:43.806 --> 03:53:45.847]  He said, we're going to revitalize our inner cities.
[03:53:47.328 --> 03:53:51.110]  Can he do that if these urban areas are all controlled by Democrats?
[03:53:51.190 --> 03:53:52.330]  Are they going to cooperate?
[03:53:52.931 --> 03:53:56.012]  And will the urban communities demand they cooperate?
[03:53:57.091 --> 03:54:08.957]  No, they're not going to cooperate because they're invested in the fallacy of Barack Obama, I call him Baby Black Jesus, and they really can't put any effort into Donald Trump.
[03:54:08.997 --> 03:54:15.620]  If Trump goes in and he's successful in the inner cities with true empowerment zones, it would be the end of the Democrat Party.
[03:54:16.100 --> 03:54:20.883]  Now, our team, and not to be self-promoting, but our team is going to do this.
[03:54:20.923 --> 03:54:21.463]  We're going to help
[03:54:22.003 --> 03:54:22.343]  We're good.
[03:54:34.275 --> 03:54:34.695]  We're good to go.
[03:54:56.736 --> 03:54:58.677]  And that's what you've got to love about this guy.
[03:54:58.717 --> 03:55:01.718]  He's saying, you know what, I know what I'm going to run into with these clowns.
[03:55:01.738 --> 03:55:03.939]  They're not going to do anything for me, but so what?
[03:55:04.260 --> 03:55:08.762]  How are you going to stop somebody from putting in, you know, a business that employs blacks?
[03:55:09.122 --> 03:55:12.744]  Eventually, you know, the black community will wake up and start to get it.
[03:55:13.924 --> 03:55:17.806]  OK, Kevin, look, you obviously live in reality.
[03:55:18.658 --> 03:55:20.278]  Tell people a little about your background.
[03:55:20.318 --> 03:55:34.482]  How did you come to be someone who understands these issues, whereas it seems like the vast majority of the black community are kind of in prison with this Democrat plantation, as they call it.
[03:55:34.723 --> 03:55:35.903]  Tell us about your background.
[03:55:37.583 --> 03:55:39.505]  Well, I have a talk I like to do.
[03:55:39.585 --> 03:55:44.909]  I'd say a funny thing happened on my way to prison, which of course I've never been, but my father was in prison.
[03:55:44.929 --> 03:55:49.192]  His brother, my uncle, who chairs my birthday, he was in prison.
[03:55:49.492 --> 03:55:53.515]  If I'd been raised on my father's side of the family, I undoubtedly would have been to prison.
[03:55:53.535 --> 03:55:54.756]  I probably couldn't have escaped it.
[03:55:54.776 --> 03:55:59.320]  I would have been the best drug dealer in Indianapolis, pardon me, Indiana.
[03:56:00.094 --> 03:56:03.735]  But I was raised by my maternal grandparents when my mother died.
[03:56:04.235 --> 03:56:05.815]  Now, how do you avoid it?
[03:56:05.915 --> 03:56:07.096]  First, I'll tell you this.
[03:56:07.456 --> 03:56:12.317]  I have never, since I had a thought in my brain, wanted to be a Democrat.
[03:56:12.637 --> 03:56:14.097]  I saw them for what they were.
[03:56:14.798 --> 03:56:17.178]  As we say in the black community, game, no gain.
[03:56:17.198 --> 03:56:20.179]  So I knew these clowns were gaming us from the beginning.
[03:56:20.299 --> 03:56:25.901]  From the moment I was five years old and I watched a Democrat give a speech, I went, I'm nothing like that.
[03:56:26.441 --> 03:56:32.044]  So my grandparents, who were Democrats by the way, instilled in me the thing that said, you're not that.
[03:56:32.084 --> 03:56:34.164]  You're going to be accountable and all these other things.
[03:56:34.945 --> 03:56:42.988]  It was Ronald Reagan who woke me up to it because when he lost, I don't remember what he lost, but I remember looking at him and he gave a speech and I said, that's not the speech of a loser.
[03:56:43.448 --> 03:56:45.969]  That's the speech of a guy who hasn't won yet.
[03:56:46.582 --> 03:56:50.744]  And I can't describe what that means, but people probably listening know what I'm talking about.
[03:56:51.124 --> 03:56:55.266]  There's a loser speech, and there's a, no, I just didn't win this time speech.
[03:56:55.606 --> 03:56:56.746]  And that's what I saw in Reagan.
[03:56:56.766 --> 03:56:58.547]  And I was like, that's my guy right there.
[03:56:58.567 --> 03:56:59.567]  My grandparents hated it.
[03:56:59.827 --> 03:57:00.168]  Shut up.
[03:57:00.208 --> 03:57:00.888]  We don't like him.
[03:57:00.948 --> 03:57:01.828]  We like Democrats.
[03:57:01.848 --> 03:57:03.089]  And I was like, I don't care who you like.
[03:57:03.589 --> 03:57:04.109]  I like him.
[03:57:04.589 --> 03:57:05.830]  Now, here's what's interesting, Joel.
[03:57:06.190 --> 03:57:14.313]  People love these Horatio Alger, these come-to-Jesus stories about Democrats converting to be Republicans, like Sheriff Clark and others.
[03:57:14.913 --> 03:57:16.234]  I've never been that stupid.
[03:57:16.889 --> 03:57:17.369]  I don't know.
[03:57:38.238 --> 03:57:42.122]  So, when I wrote my first book, The Big Black Lie... Okay, Kevin, Kevin, we got it.
[03:57:42.162 --> 03:57:43.503]  We're coming up on a break.
[03:57:43.563 --> 03:57:46.726]  I want to tell everyone to go to TheBlackSphere.net.
[03:57:46.786 --> 03:57:47.967]  Look at Kevin's website.
