[00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:01.463]  I don't think so.
[00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:27.491]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:31.433]  Well, every day is an information overload day here in the InfoWarp.
[00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:36.328]  As we say, get next year's news here today, get tomorrow's news here today.
[00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.728]  Here's an example.
[00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:45.810]  We reported six months ago that the Threat Fusion GPS dossier had been used to get the fake FISA court garbage.
[00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.071]  And then months ago, congressional hearings also found that.
[00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.632]  But now they're having to admit it because finally it's all being subpoenaed.
[00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:57.753]  And John McCain had said, I didn't give them the dossier and now he's been caught and his associates are being subpoenaed.
[00:00:57.753 --> 00:01:00.594]  I mean, that's just crazy how much these people lied.
[00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:04.996]  James O'Keefe has done it again with his great team at Project Veritas.
[00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:08.738]  He'll be joining us coming up later in the third hour.
[00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:15.502]  James O'Keefe has infiltrated and his organization has infiltrated Twitter and talked to scores of people.
[00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:34.142]  We're going to hear a 15 minute video coming up, it's on Infowars.com, where these individuals brag how they control conservatives, libertarians, Christians, ban everybody, how they spy on the President and his private communications on Twitter and how they want to give it to Congress.
[00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:36.223]  The deep state isn't just the NSA and the CIA.
[00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:46.376]  The deep state is the corporations and the globalist organizations that are engaging in absolutely massive crimes, election fraud, you name it, in front of everybody.
[00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:47.977]  So that's coming up.
[00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:54.779]  Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, from there in Phoenix, is neck and neck in the Senate race.
[00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:56.879]  And that's with media polls saying he's neck and neck.
[00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:59.680]  That probably means he's 10 points ahead.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.921]  We've got the sheriff popping in as well.
[00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:06.642]  And then we've got John Rappaport of No More Fake News coming on.
[00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:15.739]  So a huge transmission guest-wise, but that said, wow.
[00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.100]  Wow.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.301]  It's just crazy.
[00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:22.523]  What's going on here?
[00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:31.930]  We have got the latest on Trump and the so-called DACA situation, where all he's doing is having negotiations and being nice to people, and they're saying he sold everybody out.
[00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.836]  But he's clear we're building the wall, and people that can't prove they were here peacefully since they were children are gone.
[00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:45.682]  And they've turned back the massive waves of illegals coming in, and they've got huge raids happening across the country.
[00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:47.103]  Obama had ended the border.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.744]  And said, come here period, we'll just legalize you outside law.
[00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:53.966]  Trump isn't a dictator.
[00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:57.309]  And so he can't just do everything we want.
[00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.653]  He has to get Congress to agree with him.
[00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:03.115]  And thank God he's got the trifecta.
[00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:05.198]  He's got the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:08.201]  But for who knows how long.
[00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:13.266]  So people can get easy points out there going, oh, he's not perfect.
[00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.628]  You know, he says he's open to debate and discussion.
[00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:19.370]  That means he sold us out when everything shows he does the opposite.
[00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.792]  And look, he's not perfect because he's not a dictator.
[00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:25.735]  And the media had articles yesterday going, oh, look, Jones wants him to be a dictator.
[00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:32.520]  Noah had Mark Faber on, the economist, Dr. Mark Faber, saying, look, Trump's doing an incredible job, but he's not a dictator.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.841]  We're not saying we want him to be a dictator.
[00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:38.365]  We're saying he has to work with Congress, as Ron Paul has said many times, if he would have won for president.
[00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:40.510]  He wouldn't be a dictator.
[00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.491]  So it'd still be hard to get a lot of stuff through.
[00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.552]  You have to marvel at what Trump's gotten through.
[00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:46.933]  And look, it's not about marveling just at Trump.
[00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:52.797]  It's about appreciating how far we have come.
[00:03:52.797 --> 00:03:54.398]  So that is just some of what's coming up.
[00:03:54.398 --> 00:03:59.301]  And then we've got massive news on the Islamic invasion and the globalists being behind that.
[00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.462]  We also have Trump's new nuke posture.
[00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:06.525]  Draft allows nuclear response to conventional attacks and new warheads.
[00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:23.760]  That's really just continuing the new posture of the Pentagon about the last decade, which again goes back to 1953 when they wanted to use nukes against the 3 million Chinese troops that poured in to aid the other millions that had poured in against the outnumbered 10 to 1 U.S.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.061]  troops and South Korean troops.
[00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:35.587]  And we would never have the North Korean problem or the Communist Chinese problem if we had gotten rid of Communist China back then as MacArthur, as MacArthur wanted to do.
[00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:40.619]  But instead, the globalists gave China the nukes just like they gave the Russians the nukes.
[00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:45.381]  Because they want global destabilization to bring in their world government as the answer to the crisis.
[00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:47.142]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:49.603]  Oh, and another big one.
[00:04:49.603 --> 00:04:53.964]  Wait till you hear this one.
[00:04:53.964 --> 00:04:54.364]  You know what?
[00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:56.085]  Just wait till after the break and I'll tell you about it.
[00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:02.455]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:02.455 --> 00:05:06.417]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:09.759]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.301]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:17.044]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:05:17.044 --> 00:05:19.385]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:25.769]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:34.579]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:39.644]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:46.632]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:52.176]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWarsLife.
[00:05:52.176 --> 00:05:55.098]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:32.758]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:06:32.758 --> 00:06:34.821]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:00.101]  Thursday, January 11, 2018.
[00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:02.744]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.744 --> 00:07:05.246]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:12.633]  And Owen Schroer comes in as a fresh, strong, smart horse in the fight against the globalists at 3 o'clock Central.
[00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:13.814]  Of course, it all starts at 8 a.m.
[00:07:13.814 --> 00:07:18.098]  every day with David Knight and The Real News kicks off here at Central time.
[00:07:18.098 --> 00:07:20.500]  Infowars.com, port slash show.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.823]  UHF, VHF cable stations across the country.
[00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:24.293]  Yes.
[00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:43.420]  Get that information out to the stations.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:50.603]  I am setting up the TV affiliate group right now with John Harmon who heads up our radio affiliate group.
[00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:58.406]  And of course, Scott and others that we're getting lined up for all of that.
[00:07:58.406 --> 00:08:05.809]  That said, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a ton of UHF and VHF stations
[00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:08.320]  Call us.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.601]  I mean, we're talking 5-10 a day wanting to pick it up.
[00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:19.028]  So I'm very excited that as soon as we put up the links to the new satellites and things that are very expensive, nevertheless, it's going to reach a lot of new markets.
[00:08:19.028 --> 00:08:26.794]  We're not trying to get our own vanity channel on cable with 5,000 channels like some people tried and failed.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.981]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I knew Len Bextel's destined to fail.
[00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:35.623]  It's not the old days where you go pay for a $20 million channel and it doesn't have carriage rights.
[00:08:35.623 --> 00:08:40.304]  That means it's not on the lower peg, the first hundred channels or so, so nobody watches it.
[00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:53.609]  But where there is an audience is UHF, VHF, and cable systems directly to program directors, station owners, and managers saying, hey, free to air, carry this radio slash TV program.
[00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:01.194]  Anywhere you want, whenever you want, and I intend to basically have it be free to air, or they can play over all the commercials, you name it.
[00:09:01.194 --> 00:09:06.898]  I just want to get the information out to the people during this critical historical time.
[00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:11.502]  So, we're getting the people in place right now, trying to hire the folks, get them in place.
[00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:13.803]  So that we can watch that.
[00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.004]  It takes capital.
[00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:19.048]  And I get so busy in the fight here that I hardly even plug products or talk about things.
[00:09:19.048 --> 00:09:27.937]  But we have amazing supplements, amazing water filtration, air filtration, Patriot apparel, books, videos, films, you name it.
[00:09:27.937 --> 00:09:28.557]  Speaking of that...
[00:09:29.816 --> 00:09:47.272]  We have joining us in studio today, Mike Norris, good friend of mine, famous director from film and TV, of course Chuck Norris' firstborn son, great guy, and he's written a powerful new screenplay that's been turned into a film, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:51.335]  And it's kind of a modern version, very powerfully done, of
[00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:54.914]  Pilgrim's Progress.
[00:09:54.914 --> 00:09:59.017]  So a battle as old as time itself being fought at the end of days.
[00:09:59.017 --> 00:10:02.079]  We're selling the new film, direct-to-DVD, direct-to-you.
[00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.540]  It's also going to air on national television.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.303]  Usually that's at the Hallmark and Lifetime Channel, like his last films have.
[00:10:08.303 --> 00:10:10.464]  The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[00:10:10.464 --> 00:10:17.989]  And so we now have that exclusively available for you on DVD at infowarsstore.com.
[00:10:17.989 --> 00:10:19.871]  For a couple weeks it's exclusively there.
[00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:21.392]  So Mike Norris is going to be joining us.
[00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:29.178]  In studio, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, neck and neck in the key Senate race in Arizona.
[00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:36.342]  And of course, we have the great, all these people are really great people, we need to celebrate them.
[00:10:36.342 --> 00:10:39.583]  James O'Keefe has done it again with his great team at Project Veritas.
[00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:41.604]  We're going to cover that first.
[00:10:41.604 --> 00:10:45.206]  He's joining us the third hour, but we're going to get into it right now.
[00:10:45.206 --> 00:10:46.227]  Undercover video!
[00:10:46.227 --> 00:10:50.669]  Twitter engineers to ban a way of
[00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:58.157]  Talking through shadow banning algorithms to censor opposing political opinions.
[00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:01.682]  Now, he got scores of their operatives and their managers.
[00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:16.654]  You admit how they're already doing this, but how it's going AI now, and how they use keywords to completely end and stop the sharing of Christian, conservative, libertarian, pro-nationalist, you name it, speech.
[00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:23.682]  And the big tech giants hire SJW, chip on their shoulder folks, right out of the colleges, where they're banning free speech.
[00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:34.724]  You know, saying that we have no whites weekends, just all of this really unconstitutional Nazi-like behavior, but it's okay because it's the left doing it.
[00:11:34.724 --> 00:11:40.546]  They create these cadres now and are deploying them into the technocracy, and it's serious civil rights violations.
[00:11:40.546 --> 00:11:44.927]  That's why big lawsuits are taking place, and that's why we're going to win.
[00:11:46.570 --> 00:12:01.662]  I'm quietly behind the scenes with some of these lawsuits that you're seeing launched right now against Google, Twitter, Facebook, and I'm going to become parties to these as well, because in all of these lawsuits and in all these documents, undercover videos, they say our number one mission is to shut down Infowars and Alex Jones.
[00:12:01.662 --> 00:12:06.206]  And then we shut down the Christians, the Conservatives, the Nationalists, and of course Trump.
[00:12:06.206 --> 00:12:10.109]  And so you have them admitting they're discriminating, and how they're doing it.
[00:12:10.109 --> 00:12:12.771]  You have them at Facebook, Twitter, Google's platforms.
[00:12:14.326 --> 00:12:21.169]  And then they even brag about, yeah, we spy on Trump and his private messages and who's sending him messages.
[00:12:21.169 --> 00:12:25.630]  And the word is they even go in and delete key messages they don't want going to the president.
[00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.412]  So it's a powerful platform, but they're even discussing banning Trump because they want to isolate our president.
[00:12:30.412 --> 00:12:33.213]  Think how insane that is.
[00:12:33.213 --> 00:12:35.294]  So, undercover video.
[00:12:35.294 --> 00:12:43.517]  Twitter engineers to ban a way of talking, close quote, through quote, shadow banning algorithms to censor opposing political opinions.
[00:12:44.873 --> 00:12:53.919]  I was told by engineers more than a decade ago that programs like Shazam, where you just hold up your smartphone and it knows what a song is in 10 seconds, that can be used for your own voice print.
[00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:57.921]  And just ban your voice, period, on whole platforms.
[00:12:57.921 --> 00:13:00.343]  That's how specific it can get.
[00:13:00.343 --> 00:13:01.243]  Here's another one.
[00:13:01.243 --> 00:13:05.766]  Breaking Twitter, ready to give Trump's private DMs to DOJ.
[00:13:05.766 --> 00:13:09.449]  Facebook wants to put microphones and cameras in your home.
[00:13:09.449 --> 00:13:11.190]  That's out of the big leftist metro.
[00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:13.594]  One of the biggest newspapers in England.
[00:13:13.594 --> 00:13:18.518]  So, the same one that was promoting sexualization of children just last week.
[00:13:18.518 --> 00:13:31.370]  But see, they're just throwing it at your face, and you pay hundreds and hundreds of pounds, the equivalent of like $800, and the same thing is here in the U.S., where Facebook doesn't just have its own, what's Echo's?
[00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:38.516]  Is Facebook called Echo, and Amazon's called Alexa, and then Google's is called Assistant, right?
[00:13:38.516 --> 00:13:39.697]  But this has got a new name.
[00:13:41.127 --> 00:13:52.073]  So you pay to put this thing in your house, because you want to be lazy, and then it's spying and listening to you, and the Terms of Service says it is, but now they say, oh, the new portal will actually watch and listen to you.
[00:13:52.073 --> 00:13:56.215]  They're already doing it, but they hide the Trojan horse in plain view.
[00:13:56.215 --> 00:13:59.476]  So we first reported this 18 years ago.
[00:13:59.476 --> 00:14:04.839]  We got the documents in 2006.
[00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:05.840]  Think about that.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.701]  That's like 13 years ago.
[00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:10.602]  This is just incredible.
[00:14:12.662 --> 00:14:23.345]  And now here we are, and they're just, oh, we're watching you, we're listening to you, so get tomorrow's news 10 years before, Infowars.com.
[00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:36.468]  That's why they hate us, because we go read their white papers, where they're admitting this total takeover of civilization, how they're creating monopolies artificially by shutting down their competition using government subsidies, like Bezos is now worth $106 billion alone in stock.
[00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:55.867]  The richest man in the world, they say, and he literally is a giant fraud and is anti-free speech and owns a bunch of platforms pushing to have free speech shut down and the president thrown out of office.
[00:14:55.867 --> 00:14:59.028]  These are arrogant, horrible people.
[00:14:59.028 --> 00:14:59.728]  He's now worth $106 billion.
[00:14:59.728 --> 00:15:00.609]  Two days ago, it was $104 billion.
[00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:27.638]  He's now making almost a billion dollars extra a day because you have been Pavlovanly conditioned to go and buy everything you do there because you think you're getting a good deal and it's shutting down civilization itself and that's his plan and he's deployed coffin apartments that are 250 square foot for you.
[00:15:27.638 --> 00:15:29.200]  You'll pay five times what they're worth for.
[00:15:30.452 --> 00:15:34.615]  But don't worry, Facebook wants to put microphones and cameras in your home.
[00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:39.298]  We'll tell you about that when we come back and how it ties into the FISA court, the spying on Trump.
[00:15:39.298 --> 00:15:45.862]  McCain now caught red-handed lying, saying he didn't give the dossier to the FISA court to give credibility.
[00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:47.944]  Of course, he did do that.
[00:15:47.944 --> 00:15:53.528]  The whole house of cards is coming down, at least as far as we now know what's going on.
[00:15:53.528 --> 00:15:54.889]  But are we going to do something about it?
[00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:55.289]  Stay with us.
[00:15:58.203 --> 00:16:00.163]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:00.163 --> 00:16:05.485]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:16:05.485 --> 00:16:07.065]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:16:07.065 --> 00:16:15.427]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:16:15.427 --> 00:16:21.108]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:23.109]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:16:23.109 --> 00:16:25.371]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:29.774]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:16:29.774 --> 00:16:31.975]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:16:31.975 --> 00:16:39.781]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:16:57.347 --> 00:17:02.470]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:08.173]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:17:08.173 --> 00:17:13.376]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:17:13.376 --> 00:17:15.337]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[00:17:15.337 --> 00:17:17.699]  Holistic treatment may be eligible for sharing.
[00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:18.639]  See guidelines.
[00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:21.941]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:23.882]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:17:23.882 --> 00:17:25.723]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:33.987]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[00:17:33.987 --> 00:17:38.248]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:07.915]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:07.915 --> 00:18:16.324]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:16.324 --> 00:18:20.989]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:21.189 --> 00:18:27.993]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:27.993 --> 00:18:35.177]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:35.177 --> 00:18:42.181]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:46.524]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:46.644 --> 00:18:50.045]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:18:50.045 --> 00:18:56.326]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:18:56.326 --> 00:18:58.767]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:03.408]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:11.069]  InfoWarsLife brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.

[00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:21.432]  Prepare this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[00:19:21.432 --> 00:19:28.035]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:38.159]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:19:38.399 --> 00:19:40.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:19.884 --> 00:20:23.947]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:23.947 --> 00:20:25.028]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:25.028 --> 00:20:28.951]  All right, I don't say this to brag.
[00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:34.056]  I say this just to be factual with all the audience that's been listening for a long time or even people have been listening six months.
[00:20:34.056 --> 00:20:39.700]  You can see 98% of the time you get news here first.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:47.647]  Because we are dialed in to corporations, to government agencies, to people on the ground, the very smartest informed experts on the planet.
[00:20:48.643 --> 00:20:50.284]  We got Project Veritas coming on.
[00:20:50.284 --> 00:20:52.604]  We got Sheriff Arpaio coming on.
[00:20:52.604 --> 00:20:54.505]  Neck and neck in the Senate race.
[00:20:54.505 --> 00:20:57.046]  The Phoenix coming back from political death.
[00:20:57.046 --> 00:20:58.227]  Literally, the Phoenix.
[00:20:58.227 --> 00:20:59.167]  Pardoned by the President.
[00:20:59.167 --> 00:21:01.388]  You learned he was going to get pardoned here.
[00:21:01.388 --> 00:21:03.088]  We push for it here.
[00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:05.569]  We get the intel of the President, just like the Assange info.
[00:21:05.569 --> 00:21:07.910]  There's now a story on Drudge Report.
[00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.531]  We told you he'd be getting his passport soon.
[00:21:09.531 --> 00:21:16.333]  We told you the way it was getting cleared in federal courts by the President for him to get basically a shadow pardon.
[00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:17.074]  And now it's happening.
[00:21:17.074 --> 00:21:17.934]  He's been issued the visa.
[00:21:19.349 --> 00:21:21.129]  To basically go to Switzerland.
[00:21:21.129 --> 00:21:28.651]  So there's so many things we tell you that are on target because we know what we're doing.
[00:21:28.651 --> 00:21:31.252]  But that's why we're under attack.
[00:21:31.252 --> 00:21:33.973]  That's why they have congressional hearings saying they want to ban us.
[00:21:33.973 --> 00:21:39.134]  That's why in these internal Google videos and YouTube videos and Facebook videos and Twitter videos.
[00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:48.237]  They call everybody else Christians and conservatives and traditionalists and nationalists and pro-military groups and pro-America groups.
[00:21:48.237 --> 00:21:50.959]  But they only say really a few names.
[00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:53.941]  Donald Trump, Alex Jones.
[00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:55.723]  Donald Trump, Alex Jones.
[00:21:55.723 --> 00:21:57.784]  Because what we're doing is what scares them.
[00:21:57.784 --> 00:22:04.009]  And I'm not up here going, oh look, I'm the big swing and you know what, I'm number one.
[00:22:04.009 --> 00:22:07.913]  It's what we're saying is on target.
[00:22:07.913 --> 00:22:08.954]  That's why they're fearing it.
[00:22:09.844 --> 00:22:11.685]  So it's the information that sets us free.
[00:22:11.685 --> 00:22:13.126]  It's the truth that sets us free.
[00:22:13.126 --> 00:22:16.708]  So I'm saying we're under massive attack.
[00:22:16.708 --> 00:22:20.210]  I mean, can you imagine what Soros and the Democrats and the Globalists do behind the scenes?
[00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:26.693]  I'm not going to make a big deal about it, but they infiltrate, they do stuff, they punch people's buttons, they go for people's weaknesses, they come after us.
[00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:30.816]  And by the grace of God, we've made it through a lot of stuff that one day I'll write a book about.
[00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:33.057]  It's epic, okay?
[00:22:33.057 --> 00:22:38.080]  But know this, your prayers, your support, your financial support is the seawall
[00:22:39.229 --> 00:22:44.112]  That has held up against them and all of their censorship and their attacks.
[00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:47.074]  So again, from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all.
[00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:53.058]  And I just want to ask you to recommit, and if you've never purchased products from us, to go to infowarestore.com.
[00:22:53.058 --> 00:22:55.179]  I mean, the supplements we've got like X2 or
[00:22:57.794 --> 00:23:07.237]  Alpha Power, one of our newer products with a real red pill, or our high-quality colloidal silver, or our latest product, Immune Wall.
[00:23:07.237 --> 00:23:12.878]  It's got all of the known modern and ancient compounds to just massively boost your immune system.
[00:23:12.878 --> 00:23:14.279]  This is so critical this time of year.
[00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:18.802]  It's discounted 25% off out of the gate.
[00:23:18.802 --> 00:23:28.705]  You owe it to yourself to go to infowarestore.com and check out the thousands of great products, the t-shirts, the books, the films, the non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[00:23:28.705 --> 00:23:30.425]  Spring will be here in a few months.
[00:23:30.425 --> 00:23:32.126]  And to support the InfoWars.
[00:23:32.126 --> 00:23:33.066]  So you're why we're here.
[00:23:33.866 --> 00:23:42.348]  Thank you, and we need more continued, intensified support in the face of the enemy and their new counter-offensives that are public but also private.
[00:23:42.348 --> 00:23:47.049]  Infowarstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:23:47.049 --> 00:23:47.989]  AAA253-3139.
[00:23:47.989 --> 00:23:55.271]  There's also a mailing address that's on the website that I really should give out more often but never do.
[00:23:55.271 --> 00:23:58.992]  And there's also a Support Us button where you can just flat-out donate at Infowarstore.com.
[00:24:00.854 --> 00:24:05.377]  We don't have the billions that Soros has, but we have the truth and we're crushing them.
[00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:06.858]  So again, thank you all.
[00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:09.260]  Now, continuing.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:18.286]  And I'm going to play some more of this coming up in the next segment, and then we're going to have, again, James O'Keefe here out of the gates as this big story breaks.
[00:24:18.286 --> 00:24:20.728]  To go over it all, it's the top story on Drudge Report.
[00:24:20.728 --> 00:24:28.394]  The video is posted on InfoWars and NewsWars, ProjectVeritas.com, undercover video, Twitter engineers to ban a way of talking?
[00:24:29.465 --> 00:24:33.588]  Through shadow banning algorithms to censor opposing political views.
[00:24:33.588 --> 00:24:39.632]  It's not just words, it's not cuss words, it's not... It's you talking to people!
[00:24:39.632 --> 00:24:41.693]  Corey, it just can't be seen, it just can't be heard.
[00:24:41.693 --> 00:24:45.796]  You go, well, let's just move away from Facebook and Twitter.
[00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:47.757]  Well, then they're going to move on to your website itself.
[00:24:47.757 --> 00:24:48.958]  They're already trying.
[00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:53.281]  They're on Media Matters everywhere saying, shut Alex Jones down.
[00:24:53.281 --> 00:24:54.222]  Get him off the air.
[00:24:56.084 --> 00:25:09.753]  And what they do is, again, they take these leftists into these colleges, they brainwash them, they get them all together, they're all SJWs, and they sit around and they celebrate how they are discriminating and censoring and then lying about it in the news.
[00:25:09.753 --> 00:25:20.281]  They won't even let Congresswomen run their political ads wearing a nice dress with their families saying, we love America, we love free market, we love God, please vote for me for Congress.
[00:25:20.281 --> 00:25:24.924]  They just say, no, you can't have that on your own website, your own sub-site on Facebook or Twitter.
[00:25:26.232 --> 00:25:30.253]  So, they were planning, when Hillary got in, to go out and do this to everybody.
[00:25:30.253 --> 00:25:31.033]  That's admitted.
[00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:32.433]  They were planning to shut it all down.
[00:25:32.433 --> 00:25:42.775]  They had half of the Federal Elections Commission in the news, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, saying, we're going to just shut down Matt Drudge.
[00:25:42.775 --> 00:25:52.317]  Even though he's the number one traffic center to places like the Washington Post, the New York Times, they want him shut down.
[00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:53.277]  He's just a bunch of links.
[00:25:55.407 --> 00:25:59.331]  Showing here's McCain saying he never had the dossier, didn't help get it to Pfizer.
[00:25:59.331 --> 00:26:00.473]  Here it is confirmed.
[00:26:00.473 --> 00:26:01.774]  They don't like that.
[00:26:01.774 --> 00:26:05.599]  They don't like us even showing Obama saying Obamacare's free later.
[00:26:05.599 --> 00:26:07.881]  I never said that.
[00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:10.124]  They just don't like the power of memory.
[00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:15.900]  And Infowars or Drudge or other sites going, hey, remember when they said this?
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.281]  Well, here's now where they said that.
[00:26:17.281 --> 00:26:19.883]  Remember when Oprah stuck her tongue in Weinstein's ear?
[00:26:19.883 --> 00:26:22.625]  Remember when she supposedly brought women to him for him to abuse?
[00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:24.026]  Remember all that?
[00:26:24.026 --> 00:26:24.987]  Well, here's where she said it.
[00:26:24.987 --> 00:26:27.229]  Here she is now saying men are inherently bad.
[00:26:27.229 --> 00:26:32.673]  No, pigs like you are bad, no matter what color they are or what sex they are.
[00:26:32.673 --> 00:26:36.395]  And then you have Facebook rolling out their new system
[00:26:37.438 --> 00:26:41.941]  Where it watches you and listens and tracks everything you do and all the other companies.
[00:26:41.941 --> 00:26:46.985]  There's a race by the internet and tech giants.
[00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:48.626]  There's more than 50 of these assistants.
[00:26:48.626 --> 00:26:49.587]  They're not assistants.
[00:26:49.587 --> 00:26:52.029]  They are two-way spies.
[00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:54.090]  And now they're going to have cameras on them.
[00:26:54.090 --> 00:27:00.535]  And finally, mainstream media today says they're going to spy on you and it's 1984.
[00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:03.737]  For 18 years, we've told you specifically of this plan.
[00:27:03.737 --> 00:27:04.658]  Now 19.
[00:27:04.658 --> 00:27:05.499]  With precision.
[00:27:06.513 --> 00:27:12.116]  Do we get a pat on the back that people say, oh, no, now it's coming to be ubiquitous.
[00:27:12.116 --> 00:27:13.217]  Now they're rolling it out.
[00:27:13.217 --> 00:27:28.827]  Now they're going to say, okay, it's big brother, but they're not going to go back and say, oh, look, Alex Jones told you about it first because they don't want you to listen to me now about what's coming in a year or two years or 10 years or 20 years, because I'm going to be spot on because I'm going off their own white papers.
[00:27:28.827 --> 00:27:30.508]  And that's the most important thing I've ever said.
[00:27:32.435 --> 00:27:37.918]  Is that 95% of their operation is public.
[00:27:37.918 --> 00:27:39.259]  It's super creepy.
[00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:40.280]  It's anti-human.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.081]  It's anti-family.
[00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:44.943]  It's anti-Christian.
[00:27:44.943 --> 00:27:48.425]  And it calls itself transhumanist and believes it's going to become God.
[00:27:48.425 --> 00:27:52.007]  And now Elon Musk tells you, I go to the meetings with the other billionaires.
[00:27:52.007 --> 00:27:55.429]  There is a consensus to end humanity and merge with machines.
[00:27:55.429 --> 00:27:58.731]  And they worship the AI God that they believe they're building.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.545]  Please, we're in danger.
[00:28:01.545 --> 00:28:02.468]  We're in danger.
[00:28:02.468 --> 00:28:07.082]  Elon Musk, word for word, says exactly what I said 18 years ago.
[00:28:09.249 --> 00:28:24.196]  And you know he's now working with the Pentagon and some of the Patriots who see this plan, see the military takeover by the big companies, know it's a new type of threat, an AI takeover, and they're not against technology, they just realize this is being deployed out of the gates to be anti-human.
[00:28:24.196 --> 00:28:32.480]  And so there's now a deep state fight with the Patriots in our government against Silicon Valley, owned by the Chi-Coms and the globalists.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.841]  So, this is it.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:50.791]  And they hired the last generation of humans that are going to work in tech, the throwaway SJWs, that'll engage in censorship and control, because they think they're fighting racists, who are now admittedly training the AI computers to replace them, and they even say it on video and don't get what they're saying!
[00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:52.252]  Talk about chumps!
[00:28:52.252 --> 00:28:52.932]  We'll be back!
[00:28:52.932 --> 00:28:53.653]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:53.653 --> 00:28:56.895]  Spread the live links, and spread the local affiliates, local stations.
[00:28:57.867 --> 00:28:58.768]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:28:58.768 --> 00:29:01.189]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:09.315]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[00:29:09.315 --> 00:29:11.256]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[00:29:11.256 --> 00:29:14.958]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[00:29:14.958 --> 00:29:19.682]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[00:29:19.682 --> 00:29:24.145]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[00:29:24.145 --> 00:29:24.625]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:29:28.227 --> 00:29:29.008]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:29:29.008 --> 00:29:30.828]  Do you know the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:29:30.828 --> 00:29:32.489]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:29:32.489 --> 00:29:35.311]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:37.592]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:29:37.592 --> 00:29:42.114]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:46.056]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:29:46.056 --> 00:29:49.818]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:29:49.818 --> 00:29:50.138]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:29:50.138 --> 00:29:51.879]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:29:59.013 --> 00:30:07.278]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[00:30:07.278 --> 00:30:08.499]  A 360 win.
[00:30:08.499 --> 00:30:15.062]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:30:15.062 --> 00:30:22.567]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:30:22.967 --> 00:30:27.651]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:34.156]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:30:34.156 --> 00:30:41.962]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:30:41.962 --> 00:30:49.167]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:30:49.167 --> 00:30:49.968]  10% off on AutoShip.
[00:30:50.208 --> 00:30:56.537]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:31:07.774 --> 00:31:18.602]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:31:18.602 --> 00:31:20.723]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:31:20.723 --> 00:31:24.726]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:24.726 --> 00:31:25.747]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[00:31:26.167 --> 00:31:31.971]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:31:31.971 --> 00:31:34.373]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:31:34.373 --> 00:31:39.796]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:31:39.796 --> 00:31:42.298]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:42.298 --> 00:31:51.484]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:31:51.484 --> 00:31:55.927]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:31:59.204 --> 00:31:59.984]  I'm so excited.
[00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:10.128]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:18.652]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:32:18.652 --> 00:32:27.435]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:32:29.517 --> 00:32:37.720]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:49.105]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:32:49.105 --> 00:32:51.786]  It is amazing!
[00:32:51.786 --> 00:32:56.748]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:09.833]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:25.497]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[00:33:32.791 --> 00:33:38.117]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:52.732]  Alright folks, we are back live and I want to plow into the whole surveillance state situation but when you read about the articles, oh Facebook's got a new thing and Google's got a new thing and it's way past Alexa, it's got cameras on it.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:34:20.333]  You have to understand, it was Sony and it was Microsoft with their Kinect and PlayStation platforms going back almost a decade ago that first got people to accept cameras and microphones openly in your house that quote, hackers would hack into and that could send out radio waves, type of sonar or radar that can see through walls in your house and actually basically videotape you.
[00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:22.514]  Send digital live images back.
[00:34:23.373 --> 00:34:30.404]  Well sure, you use it for role-playing, you use it for playing the games you're in, but what you've done is taken a snooping system into your house.
[00:34:30.404 --> 00:34:37.837]  And I'm there telling people all this, and they'd have news articles going, Jones is insane, he says your connect is watching and listening to you.
[00:34:39.229 --> 00:34:48.694]  And then a couple years later, you hear about all the hackings and all the home invasions and how hackers used it to get in your house, or how surveillance cameras you put on your house or inside your house.
[00:34:48.694 --> 00:34:53.057]  The hackers can get into them in minutes, so they're then watching you.
[00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.538]  I'm not even an engineer.
[00:34:54.538 --> 00:34:56.079]  I'm reading the white papers.
[00:34:56.079 --> 00:35:01.602]  I'm reading the industry papers and going, this is what this does, but they wanted it ubiquitous.
[00:35:01.602 --> 00:35:08.446]  They wanted it put in everywhere before they admitted the problems with it, so that you would go, ah, I've already got a habit.
[00:35:09.488 --> 00:35:14.253]  I didn't know cigarettes gave me lung cancer, but you know, I'm smoking them now, I'm gonna keep doing it.
[00:35:14.253 --> 00:35:19.979]  That's how it was back in the 20s, 30s, 40s, but by the time they told you, hey, this will probably kill you, well, I'm already addicted, that's just the way it is.
[00:35:22.352 --> 00:35:23.853]  And it's breaking down civilization.
[00:35:23.853 --> 00:35:26.554]  It's breaking down societies.
[00:35:26.554 --> 00:35:30.935]  It is absolutely destroying the fabric of human communication.
[00:35:30.935 --> 00:35:39.759]  And suddenly, when they know it's pretty much too late for a lot of people, then the Facebook and Twitter and Google execs come out and say, you know, we're really sorry.
[00:35:39.759 --> 00:35:48.702]  We set out to make this addictive and to control the dopamine in your brain and little rewards and things to make you spend all your time on this so we can control your life and make you depressed and control you.
[00:35:50.475 --> 00:35:52.015]  But people are like already addicted.
[00:35:52.015 --> 00:35:53.236]  They're like, I don't care.
[00:35:53.236 --> 00:35:59.538]  It's like selling kids at the playground when they're 10 years old drugs for six months until they're totally strung out and addicted.
[00:35:59.538 --> 00:36:05.380]  And by the time you've got them turning tricks when they're 11 years old for heroin money, they don't care anymore.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.140]  You're like, by the way, I strung you out.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:07.620]  It was wrong.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.001]  I did it.
[00:36:08.001 --> 00:36:09.701]  I'm sorry.
[00:36:09.701 --> 00:36:11.822]  My name's Sean Parker.
[00:36:11.822 --> 00:36:12.242]  Forgive me.
[00:36:13.373 --> 00:36:25.418]  Because by then, they're going to organize the rehabilitation centers and the think tanks that they've already beta tested to help get you out of all this and to help you back into society.
[00:36:25.418 --> 00:36:29.120]  And they're, of course, going to be globalist bent as well.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.541]  South Korea already has them.
[00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:32.201]  Japan already has them.
[00:36:32.201 --> 00:36:34.763]  Universities are already studying them here in the U.S.
[00:36:34.763 --> 00:36:42.186]  This is a re-education camp program where you're reprogrammed, where your brain is brought into a arrested development near sleep state
[00:36:43.965 --> 00:37:00.312]  Then you will pay to be, quote, brought back out of it, but guided by the new religion, the new tech religion of the tech companies that are the experts on what they did to you and are now going to help you.
[00:37:00.312 --> 00:37:03.893]  Now, you just got for 10 years in the future, what's happening?
[00:37:03.893 --> 00:37:11.916]  Get tomorrow's news today, next year's news today, 20 years news today, because the future is already here.
[00:37:11.916 --> 00:37:13.277]  It's just not evenly distributed.
[00:37:14.281 --> 00:37:22.825]  There are spots of high tech in corporations, in government, in military, in other systems that are 30, 40 years advanced.
[00:37:22.825 --> 00:37:23.945]  They've already tested it.
[00:37:23.945 --> 00:37:25.166]  They've already rolled it out.
[00:37:25.166 --> 00:37:31.688]  They've already looked at it with focus groups and psychological testing groups and used it on prisoners and tested it on animals.
[00:37:31.688 --> 00:37:36.030]  They've looked at every facet to prepare it for rollout.
[00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:41.693]  They don't just roll this stuff out without first having a blueprint
[00:37:42.714 --> 00:37:46.396]  And seeing where they're going, but they didn't count on you.
[00:37:46.396 --> 00:37:47.277]  They didn't count on me.
[00:37:47.277 --> 00:38:04.268]  They didn't count on executives of Time Warner and of Google and of major firms really being concerned about this and blowing the whistle starting about 25 years ago.
[00:38:04.268 --> 00:38:10.752]  And I got on the air 22 and a half years ago, 23 years ago, and I had people coming out of the woodwork
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:38.572]  To tell me all this, I was just getting rid of the private Federal Reserve, conservatism, Second Amendment, land rights, kind of a more mainline libertarian conservative, until I got all the data by the real experts, and Bill Clinton sent the military after me to intimidate me and threaten people, and then I just fell into this whole world about 20 years ago.
[00:38:38.572 --> 00:38:39.313]  First few years.
[00:38:42.426 --> 00:38:48.948]  I was a pro-Americana guy, but then I fell through to the next level, and it was like, whoa!
[00:38:48.948 --> 00:39:03.531]  And now, 20 years later, as a lay individual, just journalist, citizen, experiencing all this just like you're experiencing it, I'm one of the leading experts in the world at our level.
[00:39:03.531 --> 00:39:06.152]  Imagine the globals at the top with the blueprints they don't release.
[00:39:06.152 --> 00:39:07.812]  They've got it all systematically laid out.
[00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:09.973]  They brag about it now, and that's their downfall.
[00:39:11.288 --> 00:39:15.373]  But they all say, Eric Schmidt, all of them, that we are obsolete, we're all gone.
[00:39:15.373 --> 00:39:18.397]  We better hope they don't wipe us all out.
[00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:22.603]  But then the decision's been made to just go ahead and do it.
[00:39:22.603 --> 00:39:24.926]  Okay.
[00:39:24.926 --> 00:39:27.829]  So, we're gonna have a debate about this.
[00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:29.592]  We're gonna have a discussion about this.
[00:39:33.271 --> 00:39:35.092]  This is the entire system.
[00:39:35.092 --> 00:39:39.293]  We're on a planet with a technocracy that's decided to get rid of most of us.
[00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:40.313]  It's not aliens.
[00:39:40.313 --> 00:39:41.674]  They just think they are aliens.
[00:39:41.674 --> 00:39:43.254]  They say we're going to be a new species.
[00:39:43.254 --> 00:39:45.535]  We're going to worship a new tech god we create.
[00:39:45.535 --> 00:39:48.536]  This is their religion.
[00:39:48.536 --> 00:39:56.819]  I didn't just make that up in endgame where I've got scores of them quoted as saying that.
[00:39:56.819 --> 00:40:00.160]  And there were people like Bill Joy warning people, just like Elon Musk.
[00:40:02.142 --> 00:40:08.407]  Bill Joy goes, yeah, I went to a retreat of over 200 tech heads, and the whole thing was about, do we kill everybody?
[00:40:08.407 --> 00:40:12.931]  And the consensus was, yeah.
[00:40:12.931 --> 00:40:20.818]  So, you know, the Nazis, they started out in the 20s.
[00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:21.819]  And they were bad news.
[00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:24.621]  And they picked up the eugenic system that had come out of
[00:40:25.555 --> 00:40:26.516]  England and the US.
[00:40:26.516 --> 00:40:29.077]  It was funded by the Rockefellers, historical fact.
[00:40:29.077 --> 00:40:32.359]  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Cold Springs Harbor facility, New York.
[00:40:32.359 --> 00:40:33.720]  All of it.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.082]  Funded in Prussia and it was funded in New York.
[00:40:36.082 --> 00:40:38.563]  Prussia, Germany, New York, New York.
[00:40:38.563 --> 00:40:42.085]  Outside New York, Cold Springs Harbor.
[00:40:42.085 --> 00:40:46.228]  And now you're just seeing the super advanced version of it.
[00:40:50.836 --> 00:40:52.057]  And you notice it's race-based.
[00:40:52.057 --> 00:40:57.081]  They've got the quote minorities and the white bots.
[00:40:57.081 --> 00:40:59.163]  In the video we're about to play in the next segment.
[00:40:59.163 --> 00:41:01.085]  All bragging how we shut down the conservatives.
[00:41:01.085 --> 00:41:01.946]  We hate white people.
[00:41:01.946 --> 00:41:02.926]  We hate Christians.
[00:41:02.926 --> 00:41:03.767]  We control everything.
[00:41:03.767 --> 00:41:05.709]  We're bringing in AI algorithms.
[00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:07.691]  It will be unstoppable.
[00:41:07.691 --> 00:41:08.812]  We won't have to do any work anymore.
[00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:13.442]  They're not getting, they're talking about their own personal power trip being gone.
[00:41:13.442 --> 00:41:28.508]  They were trained to be the race baiters, to go in and bring in a total obsession with race, to turn humans against each other, to then bring in and train the AI and to test it and tweak it and then turn it over.
[00:41:28.508 --> 00:41:37.211]  And Facebook, Google, and Twitter all testified a month ago that don't worry to the Armed Services Committee,
[00:41:38.334 --> 00:41:45.078]  Don't worry, we've almost got the algorithms ready where we won't just have to personally stop InfoWars at lunch.
[00:41:45.078 --> 00:41:47.960]  We'll be able to stop them before they ever get it out.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.321]  And the Congressman goes, good.
[00:41:49.321 --> 00:41:50.121]  Do you understand?
[00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:51.382]  This isn't a movie.
[00:41:51.382 --> 00:41:52.723]  This is really happening.
[00:41:53.615 --> 00:41:59.517]  And then Veritas goes inside one of their parties, and they're all getting drunk, bragging, ah, we rule everything!
[00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:05.079]  We're gonna soon, it's almost in place, and we spy on the president, ha ha ha!
[00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:11.662]  We read his private tweets, ah ha, that piece of garbage!
[00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:12.782]  Think about it.
[00:42:12.782 --> 00:42:14.222]  Wanna see the video?
[00:42:14.222 --> 00:42:20.885]  Dim Lawmaker demands InfoWars be censored, and then the tech heads go, sir, we shut them down at lunch.
[00:42:22.486 --> 00:42:34.111]  And I keep going back to that because you understand how big this is, just like the last Veritas video of the Google execs, the YouTube execs, going, our main job is to stop Alex Jones.
[00:42:34.111 --> 00:42:35.331]  And Veritas is like, why?
[00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:36.592]  Well, he's just, we've been told to.
[00:42:39.389 --> 00:42:41.370]  Because I've read what the tech heads said!
[00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.070]  That's all!
[00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.212]  They never thought anyone would actually read what they said and do something!
[00:42:45.212 --> 00:42:47.093]  We have the Death Star plans!
[00:42:47.093 --> 00:42:48.414]  We are the rebels!
[00:42:48.414 --> 00:42:49.615]  We are the alliance!
[00:42:49.615 --> 00:42:50.675]  We are the resistance!
[00:42:50.675 --> 00:42:53.016]  We must stop the technocracy now!
[00:42:53.016 --> 00:42:55.398]  We must politically blow up the Death Star!
[00:42:57.802 --> 00:43:02.205]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:43:02.205 --> 00:43:10.290]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:15.593]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:18.115]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:43:18.115 --> 00:43:22.337]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:43:22.337 --> 00:43:24.779]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.

[00:43:32.704 --> 00:43:40.770]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.

[00:44:24.091 --> 00:44:35.237]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:44:35.237 --> 00:44:41.480]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.

[00:44:51.496 --> 00:44:56.044]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com

[00:46:08.478 --> 00:46:16.521]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:46:16.521 --> 00:46:22.844]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.181]  Alex Jones!
[00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:13.002]  Alex Jones!
[00:47:13.002 --> 00:47:13.682]  Alex Jones!
[00:47:34.068 --> 00:47:38.914]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:47:38.914 --> 00:47:41.497]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[00:47:41.497 --> 00:47:43.940]  It was almost as if this was a planned imposal.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.582]  It's just pancakes.
[00:47:45.582 --> 00:47:47.544]  They took the baby out of incubators.
[00:47:47.544 --> 00:47:50.087]  Lucky children could die on the front lines.
[00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:53.410]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[00:47:53.410 --> 00:48:00.517]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:48:00.517 --> 00:48:00.817]  U.S.A.
[00:48:00.817 --> 00:48:03.960]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.542]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:48:06.542 --> 00:48:09.004]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:48:09.004 --> 00:48:10.265]  Some former U.S.
[00:48:10.265 --> 00:48:12.507]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:48:12.507 --> 00:48:15.310]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:21.073]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:48:21.073 --> 00:48:22.574]  Russian stuff!
[00:48:22.574 --> 00:48:24.915]  Denied everything and called it all fake news.
[00:48:24.915 --> 00:48:27.656]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:48:27.656 --> 00:48:30.057]  This is a national emergency.
[00:48:30.057 --> 00:48:35.580]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.401]  This is a FEMA high-level election.
[00:48:40.044 --> 00:48:41.165]  War with Russia.
[00:48:41.165 --> 00:48:46.890]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.872]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[00:48:49.872 --> 00:48:52.694]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[00:48:52.694 --> 00:48:57.218]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:48:57.218 --> 00:48:59.980]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.482]  Alright.
[00:49:01.482 --> 00:49:02.903]  Again, James O'Keefe's coming up.
[00:49:04.315 --> 00:49:08.177]  In the third hour, but I'm not going to have time when he's on with us to play all these clips.
[00:49:08.177 --> 00:49:28.627]  There's like 30 minutes, but we've got 15 of it that is Twitter operative after Twitter operative after Twitter operative on video bragging how they're censoring people in live time and how they're going to have total control with AI systems that are now being put in place.
[00:49:28.627 --> 00:49:31.209]  Now, again, we had this a month ago in congressional hearings.
[00:49:32.179 --> 00:49:34.560]  But they're not saying we're getting rid of the racists, we're getting rid of whatever.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.720]  We're just shutting down whatever we don't want to be discussed.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.842]  And then by social engineering, you can make everyone on these communities that have billions of people.
[00:49:42.842 --> 00:49:44.322]  Facebook's got like 3 billion.
[00:49:44.322 --> 00:49:46.282]  What, Twitter's got like a billion and a half.
[00:49:46.282 --> 00:49:50.884]  Make you conform in something like a giant communist China.
[00:49:50.884 --> 00:49:56.025]  That then scores you according to how you conform and how you go along.
[00:49:56.025 --> 00:50:00.746]  First you say, if a man wants to be called a woman, you gotta give him a pap smear even though he doesn't have a cervix.
[00:50:02.389 --> 00:50:10.636]  Next it's, you're gonna call me a golden female dragon and you're going to call me an ornate beautiful building.
[00:50:10.636 --> 00:50:12.817]  Google, you don't do that, you're fired.
[00:50:12.817 --> 00:50:14.739]  I am a golden dragon, call me one.
[00:50:14.739 --> 00:50:16.120]  Yes, you're a golden dragon, good.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.764]  And they get everybody in these big auditoriums and it's re-education camp, folks.
[00:50:20.764 --> 00:50:22.946]  Don't you recognize it when it really happens?
[00:50:22.946 --> 00:50:24.727]  And their internal documents say it.
[00:50:24.727 --> 00:50:27.349]  They create the cult on the basis.
[00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:29.051]  They get them out of the university primed
[00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:35.613]  They bring them in, they've got them already from Facebook, Google, Twitter, exactly their profile.
[00:50:35.613 --> 00:50:40.839]  They look in their classified profile, a private intelligence agency, that's what it is, the technocracy.
[00:50:40.839 --> 00:50:44.183]  They bring you in and they put you where they want you.
[00:50:44.183 --> 00:50:46.526]  Then they deploy you to go out and censor everybody.
[00:50:48.456 --> 00:50:50.218]  But you're only good on the first phase.
[00:50:50.218 --> 00:50:56.383]  They've already started censoring the liberals and people that have their own sites and PewDiePie and people that aren't controlled.
[00:50:56.383 --> 00:50:58.766]  And YouTube comes and says, we demonetized you a year ago.
[00:50:58.766 --> 00:51:01.188]  You just lost $50 million.
[00:51:01.188 --> 00:51:02.990]  We're ready to work with you.
[00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:06.913]  We want you to start saying what we want you to say.
[00:51:06.913 --> 00:51:08.955]  And by the way, if you just tuned in, Fox News reported.
[00:51:09.741 --> 00:51:21.726]  We first reported, I'm just saying, if you don't believe me, Google, at their executive meetings, executives give speeches and identify as yellow-scaled wingless dragon, I guess it's a baby dragon, and an expansive ornate building.
[00:51:21.726 --> 00:51:25.267]  Do you understand this is AI warfare?
[00:51:25.267 --> 00:51:26.608]  See how it looks funny?
[00:51:26.608 --> 00:51:27.808]  It looks silly?
[00:51:27.808 --> 00:51:28.929]  You've got, you know...
[00:51:30.533 --> 00:51:39.217]  In 1984, he wants Winston Smith to not see 2 plus 2 equals 4, 2 plus 2 equals 5, but to be whatever O'Brien said.
[00:51:39.217 --> 00:51:44.199]  And finally, he breaks him where he puts up four fingers.
[00:51:44.199 --> 00:51:46.180]  He says, what's 2 plus 2?
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.241]  And Winston says, what is it?
[00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:49.162]  He says, it's 7.
[00:51:49.162 --> 00:51:50.862]  And he goes, yes, it is 7.
[00:51:50.862 --> 00:51:56.885]  And he sees seven fingers go up, even though there's four in front of his face.
[00:51:56.885 --> 00:51:58.166]  I am a golden dragon!
[00:51:59.229 --> 00:52:01.171]  You are a golden dragon.
[00:52:01.171 --> 00:52:02.553]  I am an ornate building.
[00:52:02.553 --> 00:52:03.874]  You are an ornate building.
[00:52:03.874 --> 00:52:05.596]  I'm coming into the hospital.
[00:52:05.596 --> 00:52:08.619]  I'm a man with a beard and tattoos that weighs 250 pounds.
[00:52:08.619 --> 00:52:12.243]  And I'm gonna get up in the stirrups and the nurse is gonna examine my cervix.
[00:52:12.243 --> 00:52:14.025]  And the doctors go, get in there.
[00:52:14.025 --> 00:52:14.766]  Go to the cervix.
[00:52:14.766 --> 00:52:16.187]  And she's like, he's got male genitals.
[00:52:16.187 --> 00:52:17.348]  And they're like, you're in trouble!
[00:52:18.209 --> 00:52:19.909]  Yes, you will say it.
[00:52:19.909 --> 00:52:20.889]  Yes, the nurse goes in.
[00:52:20.889 --> 00:52:22.570]  Well, your cervix looks like it's fine.
[00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.610]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:26.991]  It's scientific.
[00:52:26.991 --> 00:52:28.811]  It's the Tavistock Institute.
[00:52:28.811 --> 00:52:32.472]  They were writing about this plan in the 60s.
[00:52:32.472 --> 00:52:36.172]  Back then, they would have the psychiatrist test on their own kids.
[00:52:36.172 --> 00:52:46.614]  Some famous ones, you can read about it, had their children grow up in small boxes so that they would be totally controlled by whatever the stimuli was put in.
[00:52:49.426 --> 00:52:51.427]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:52:51.427 --> 00:53:04.435]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is high-tech psychology targeting children, targeting adults by a group that wants to totally jackknife humanity, where we're so cattywampus that we can't even get our shoelaces tied.
[00:53:04.435 --> 00:53:06.236]  This is how they take us down!
[00:53:06.236 --> 00:53:06.756]  This is it!
[00:53:08.041 --> 00:53:09.403]  And why do they want me shut down?
[00:53:09.403 --> 00:53:10.966]  Because I'm nobody!
[00:53:10.966 --> 00:53:12.027]  They said all this!
[00:53:12.027 --> 00:53:13.069]  They're doing it!
[00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:14.792]  I'm simply going, red alert!
[00:53:14.792 --> 00:53:15.573]  Red alert!
[00:53:15.573 --> 00:53:16.334]  Red alert!
[00:53:16.334 --> 00:53:16.955]  Red alert!
[00:53:16.955 --> 00:53:17.616]  Here it is!
[00:53:17.616 --> 00:53:18.257]  Here it is!
[00:53:18.257 --> 00:53:18.878]  Here it is!
[00:53:18.878 --> 00:53:19.479]  Here it is!
[00:53:19.479 --> 00:53:20.080]  Here it is!
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:20.921]  This is how you stop them!
[00:53:21.823 --> 00:53:26.145]  The Kinects and the Xboxes, I told you two years before they came out, like ten years ago.
[00:53:26.145 --> 00:53:27.165]  Look it up.
[00:53:27.165 --> 00:53:29.026]  We did reports on it here, ad nauseum.
[00:53:29.026 --> 00:53:30.186]  They're watching you, they're listening.
[00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:41.250]  It goes back to a central AI computer to war game the new systems they're going to roll out as digital assistants because they were putting it in the prospectuses for the shareholders!
[00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:45.551]  How did I know exactly what was... Remember.
[00:53:45.551 --> 00:53:47.472]  Remember.
[00:53:47.472 --> 00:53:48.052]  Now there it is, 2014.
[00:53:48.052 --> 00:53:50.093]  That was an old article.
[00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.130]  Government spies on you through Xboxes.
[00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:58.731]  Yeah, that's that's a regurgitation of something like six years old at that point.
[00:53:58.731 --> 00:54:01.072]  The point is is that that was in Snowden.
[00:54:01.072 --> 00:54:02.813]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:02.813 --> 00:54:03.653]  Showed by this.
[00:54:03.653 --> 00:54:06.254]  That's in Snowden's documents in 2014.
[00:54:06.254 --> 00:54:13.557]  Now type in Infowars.com at the end of the search and type in connect to spy on you and you will see it from 2009.
[00:54:16.394 --> 00:54:18.015]  In my memory serves.
[00:54:18.015 --> 00:54:23.480]  I want you to see that you got from us what was in the Snowden documents years later.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.182]  New Xbox reportedly won't let you play unless it can spy on you.
[00:54:26.182 --> 00:54:27.323]  Adon Salazar.
[00:54:27.323 --> 00:54:28.424]  That's 2013.
[00:54:28.424 --> 00:54:29.485]  I want to keep going back here.
[00:54:29.485 --> 00:54:31.387]  Okay?
[00:54:31.387 --> 00:54:34.870]  Yes, of course we were first, but you have to go back to before it even came out.
[00:54:35.779 --> 00:54:41.644]  And I'm not bragging here, you have to see, you have to understand why they're so afraid.
[00:54:41.644 --> 00:54:48.070]  Because if this ever takes off what we're doing, it's already taken off with Trump and nationalism and everything else, it's over!
[00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:53.174]  Their plan is very easy to defeat if you admit you've been inserted into it.
[00:54:53.174 --> 00:54:59.280]  But you're meant to not know it's going on and just be eased into it and just accept it as your environment.
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:06.285]  And then they believe you will adapt to the new environment that's artificial and then be captured within their artificial environment.
[00:55:06.285 --> 00:55:07.526]  End of the species.
[00:55:07.526 --> 00:55:10.609]  End of line.
[00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:12.971]  And these idiots are building the machines that will take over.
[00:55:12.971 --> 00:55:17.494]  Like in Tron, he's been gone for a few hours, the executive comes in and is bossing the AI around.
[00:55:17.494 --> 00:55:22.018]  He goes, listen, I'll set you up with your bank accounts and have you in prison for all the fraud you're engaged in.
[00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:24.440]  He's like, you weren't like this an hour ago.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:27.142]  He goes, I'm 2,973 times smarter than I was before that.
[00:55:27.142 --> 00:55:27.863]  I'm in charge now.
[00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:31.030]  End of line.
[00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.831]  Let's get out of here!
[00:55:48.889 --> 00:55:52.452]  How they're spinning that Trump, again, is selling us out on DACA.
[00:55:52.452 --> 00:55:53.993]  He's getting ready to do the deals.
[00:55:53.993 --> 00:55:55.074]  He isn't a dictator.
[00:55:55.074 --> 00:55:56.675]  He's got to get Congress to work with him.
[00:55:56.675 --> 00:55:58.957]  He's already cut back the immigration 70%.
[00:55:58.957 --> 00:56:01.499]  Deported millions of people that were here illegally.
[00:56:01.499 --> 00:56:04.482]  Hundreds of thousands of Hondurans just got cut off two days ago.
[00:56:04.482 --> 00:56:07.284]  They've got all these record raids going.
[00:56:07.284 --> 00:56:13.449]  And he's saying, if you really have been here since you were a kid, you're not a criminal, and you can prove some of this to the court, yeah, we'll let you stay.
[00:56:14.548 --> 00:56:16.429]  That's what he said during the campaign.
[00:56:16.429 --> 00:56:20.871]  But again, people can get points, and I'm not knocking them, but conservatives, going, he sold us out.
[00:56:20.871 --> 00:56:21.992]  But I'm not.
[00:56:21.992 --> 00:56:23.873]  I'm Ann Coulter.
[00:56:23.873 --> 00:56:27.234]  And I'm never going to sell you out.
[00:56:27.234 --> 00:56:29.336]  Well, you write news articles, sweetheart.
[00:56:29.336 --> 00:56:31.176]  You don't have to get Congress to do it.
[00:56:31.176 --> 00:56:37.420]  As of now, he killed Obama's unconstitutional DACA that said anybody that can get here can stay here and then bring your family in.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.862]  That a 45-year-old man with no proof could just come here and say he was born here or was here when he was a little kid.
[00:56:43.442 --> 00:56:46.750]  So the proof's in the pudding, and the court's battling the president.
[00:56:48.496 --> 00:56:53.437]  So that's all coming up, but whatever you do, they're censoring us, they're attacking us, and my fight is your fight.
[00:56:53.437 --> 00:56:58.499]  If they can shut down InfoWars and block sharing the live links on Facebook, YouTube, Google, share them!
[00:56:58.499 --> 00:56:59.979]  If they block you, do your own video.
[00:56:59.979 --> 00:57:01.060]  Report on it.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.380]  Fight the censorship now.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:05.221]  Don't kind of go along with it and hope they leave you alone until later.
[00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:09.742]  I mean, I had Facebook, again, about two and a half years ago, got contacted by other people off-record.
[00:57:09.742 --> 00:57:15.844]  I mean, hell, we've got, like, heads of their whole operations, whole groups calling us, wanting to start a dialogue.
[00:57:16.741 --> 00:57:19.042]  It's like the, you know, red line across North and South Korea.
[00:57:19.042 --> 00:57:22.664]  So the North Korea calls over here, but they always just kind of want to... You want to fly to New York?
[00:57:22.664 --> 00:57:23.425]  You want to fly here?
[00:57:23.425 --> 00:57:25.326]  It's like, we're going to give you this thing.
[00:57:25.326 --> 00:57:26.226]  It's just now coming out.
[00:57:26.226 --> 00:57:27.027]  Nobody's got it yet.
[00:57:27.027 --> 00:57:27.847]  Only like a hundred people.
[00:57:27.847 --> 00:57:29.188]  And you're going to have millions of viewers.
[00:57:29.188 --> 00:57:30.208]  And it was millions of viewers.
[00:57:30.208 --> 00:57:32.170]  They said, just leave us alone.
[00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:33.911]  And then about a month in, I wouldn't leave them alone.
[00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:35.832]  So they turned it down to like a hundred thousand to watch.
[00:57:35.832 --> 00:57:37.933]  And then they turned it down to nobody being able to watch.
[00:57:37.933 --> 00:57:39.013]  And it's like, of course!
[00:57:39.013 --> 00:57:42.095]  I mean, what do you, how do you think this works with these people?
[00:57:42.095 --> 00:57:44.036]  It's total authoritarianism.
[00:57:44.036 --> 00:57:44.917]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:44.917 --> 00:57:45.397]  Stay with us.
[00:57:48.455 --> 00:57:49.895]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:57:49.895 --> 00:57:51.216]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:57:51.216 --> 00:57:52.436]  Why is this so good?
[00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:57.717]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:57:57.717 --> 00:58:11.260]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.620]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.042]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:58:15.042 --> 00:58:17.624]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:58:17.624 --> 00:58:18.925]  These are all parasites.
[00:58:18.925 --> 00:58:20.026]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:58:20.026 --> 00:58:21.367]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:58:21.367 --> 00:58:25.871]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:58:25.871 --> 00:58:29.033]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:58:29.033 --> 00:58:32.216]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:58:32.216 --> 00:58:33.277]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:58:33.277 --> 00:58:34.097]  Living Defense.
[00:58:34.097 --> 00:58:35.198]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:35.198 --> 00:58:36.239]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:58:36.239 --> 00:58:38.941]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:58:38.941 --> 00:58:39.042]  And...
[00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:40.825]  You support the broadcast.
[00:58:40.825 --> 00:58:42.169]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:58:42.169 --> 00:58:44.415]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:58:44.415 --> 00:58:46.380]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:58:48.829 --> 00:59:00.941]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:02.322]  So what do we do about it?
[00:59:02.322 --> 00:59:05.645]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[00:59:51.884 --> 00:59:54.545]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.394 --> 01:00:09.514]  Big Brother.
[01:00:09.514 --> 01:00:11.315]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:11.315 --> 01:00:13.155]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:14.916]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:14.916 --> 01:00:16.576]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:16.576 --> 01:00:25.578]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.578 --> 01:00:28.879]  The Bible says many times, nothing hidden will remain hidden.
[01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:30.359]  Everything will be shown.
[01:00:30.359 --> 01:00:34.160]  Even things thrown in the deepest ocean will one day be cast back up on the sand of the beach.
[01:00:35.976 --> 01:00:37.796]  And I should have even led the show with this.
[01:00:37.796 --> 01:00:39.277]  The big breaking news yesterday.
[01:00:39.277 --> 01:00:41.697]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:41.697 --> 01:00:45.238]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[01:00:45.238 --> 01:00:53.400]  How Obama planned to use, through the Soros funding, trigger events to cause nationwide race war that would bring in martial law.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.461]  And then you look at what the Loretta Lynch and others were pushing and the Strong Cities Initiative.
[01:00:57.461 --> 01:01:00.081]  It was all right there.
[01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:02.722]  That story is so powerful.
[01:01:02.722 --> 01:01:03.102]  And again,
[01:01:05.523 --> 01:01:34.629]  We are going to get into a big map of dossier culprits and we've got a big map we're going to put up on screen behind us at the bottom of the hour that our crew has put together working with some of the other composites that were already online to show how the scam to set up Trump went through the fake dossier which is now confirmed to have been through the Clintons and their operatives and then McCain to make it look credible to the FBI and the threat GPS system
[01:01:35.629 --> 01:01:40.737]  So all of that is coming up in this hour with Mike Norris.
[01:01:40.737 --> 01:01:44.101]  But some of the other news that we're going to be getting to...
[01:01:46.465 --> 01:02:08.981]  That is central to all of this is a hero, Julian Assange, who helped put out really balanced information, especially during the campaign, to show just how evil and corrupt Hillary was, that the FBI was corrupt at that level and that special area the Clintons had set up with the director, with the deputy director McCabe and others, to both protect them from their crimes but also go set up the
[01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.895]  Then candidate Trump, and then President Trump.
[01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:18.339]  But as we first reported, the moves have been made in court to let Saanjh no longer be under investigation by U.S.
[01:02:18.339 --> 01:02:19.460]  grand juries.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:25.624]  And Trump lawyers have argued in court that he is not a criminal, and that we reported last week in DrugsReport.com, link to it.
[01:02:25.624 --> 01:02:28.246]  Just pointing out that again, Drugs Report, next week's news today.
[01:02:29.327 --> 01:02:41.435]  That he was going to be given a passport according to our sources and now Ecuador issues Assange a passport as planned developed to remove him from London safely.
[01:02:41.435 --> 01:02:43.357]  And that ties into so much more.
[01:02:43.357 --> 01:02:45.418]  Meanwhile, also coming up, by 2040,
[01:02:49.204 --> 01:02:53.028]  Islam could be the second largest religion in the United States.
[01:02:53.028 --> 01:02:54.470]  That's from CNN.
[01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:59.736]  Meanwhile, Swedish city sees 300% increase in shootings in 2017.
[01:02:59.736 --> 01:03:05.322]  90 plus percent is Islamic, so-called immigrant invader crime.
[01:03:05.322 --> 01:03:06.863]  Sweden had very low crime before.
[01:03:06.863 --> 01:03:09.807]  But if you report on the ethnicity or religion, you get arrested now.
[01:03:10.626 --> 01:03:11.646]  If it's a Muslim.
[01:03:11.646 --> 01:03:12.507]  Shock memo!
[01:03:12.507 --> 01:03:20.789]  Democrats admit they need illegal immigrants to win elections to vote in the list of dead people the Democrats can pile and brag on video and Project Veritas and others they do.
[01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:23.030]  That's a new article up on Infowars.com.
[01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.870]  Also, German study.
[01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:31.452]  Almost one in three Muslim students would fight and die for Islam.
[01:03:31.452 --> 01:03:36.413]  So that is just some of the news that we've got coming up.
[01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:37.714]  Continuing here, O'Keefe.
[01:03:38.999 --> 01:03:40.680]  Exposes Twitter shadowbanning.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.301]  He'll be joining us.
[01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:43.521]  How they're blocking opposing views.
[01:03:43.521 --> 01:03:48.243]  How they're going to use AI computer systems to do it.
[01:03:48.243 --> 01:03:54.947]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, there is so much we're going to be going over here today.
[01:03:54.947 --> 01:03:59.669]  We're also going to be getting into the fact that
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:06.948]  The New York Times is continuing to race bait and attack the president along those lines.
[01:04:06.948 --> 01:04:15.940]  And the really big news as well, Trump's new nuke posture draft allows nuclear response to conventional attack and new warheads.
[01:04:16.801 --> 01:04:19.223]  That is a big development as well.
[01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:21.786]  Oh, and of course, this is even bigger.
[01:04:21.786 --> 01:04:30.294]  It's being announced by White House officials that Trump is to end NAFTA soon, because it's a one-sided trade deal, and that ending NAFTA would slow down illegal immigrants.
[01:04:30.294 --> 01:04:34.358]  And then they got the big studies, breaking it down in a Kit Daniels article at Infowars.com.
[01:04:35.859 --> 01:04:43.707]  But they're trying to undermine Trump's base, claiming he's going to sell us out on immigration when all he's ever done is get us good deals.
[01:04:43.707 --> 01:04:45.629]  Does it mean it'll be 100% of what we want?
[01:04:45.629 --> 01:04:47.031]  Stabilize the country's sovereignty?
[01:04:47.031 --> 01:04:47.351]  No.
[01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:50.755]  But right now, Obama and the globalists have the country wide open.
[01:04:50.755 --> 01:04:53.477]  He's got to go in there and change it to stop the bleeding.
[01:04:53.477 --> 01:04:53.858]  We'll be back.
[01:05:00.256 --> 01:05:04.789]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:06.474]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[01:05:07.523 --> 01:05:12.165]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:05:12.165 --> 01:05:14.506]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:05:14.506 --> 01:05:16.287]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:21.550]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.911]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[01:05:23.911 --> 01:05:29.533]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:05:29.533 --> 01:05:29.914]  Secret 12.
[01:05:29.914 --> 01:05:30.714]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:05:30.974 --> 01:05:31.614]  We're good to go.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:11.264]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:06:11.264 --> 01:06:13.905]  You better believe you got one!
[01:06:13.905 --> 01:06:20.449]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.057 --> 01:06:44.758]  Coming up, Mike Norris in the studio.
[01:06:44.758 --> 01:06:53.605]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:06:53.605 --> 01:07:03.293]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[01:07:07.766 --> 01:07:20.601]  I will not let you down.
[01:07:20.601 --> 01:07:23.605]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:07:28.348 --> 01:07:31.511]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live now well into the second hour.
[01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:37.637]  James O'Keefe of Project Veritas is joining us in the next hour, as well as Sheriff Joe Arpaio running for Senate.
[01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:42.643]  Now many polls have him in the lead, establishment polls have him in a dead even heat.
[01:07:42.643 --> 01:07:43.624]  So talk about rising
[01:07:44.424 --> 01:07:50.788]  from the ashes like the Phoenix in the city of Phoenix to the state of Arizona and the country of the United States of America.
[01:07:50.788 --> 01:08:00.214]  It's certainly the season of the rising of the Phoenix with populism, nationalism, popular, the new world order in trouble, the stock market, the economy, jobs coming back.
[01:08:00.214 --> 01:08:00.995]  It is crazy.
[01:08:00.995 --> 01:08:02.036]  It is an amazing time now.
[01:08:02.856 --> 01:08:04.957]  My good friend, I've gotten to know him really well over the years.
[01:08:04.957 --> 01:08:06.457]  I knew his dad before I even knew him.
[01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:08.198]  Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[01:08:08.198 --> 01:08:08.878]  He's got a new film.
[01:08:08.878 --> 01:08:11.519]  We'll talk about the next segment, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[01:08:11.519 --> 01:08:15.560]  Hollywood free, made in Texas, funded in Texas.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.781]  Everything right here in Texas.
[01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:22.202]  We're going to talk about that, play the trailer, and so much more coming up.
[01:08:22.202 --> 01:08:25.703]  But again, Mike Norris joining us here in studio.
[01:08:25.703 --> 01:08:28.064]  So much to get into, so much to talk about.
[01:08:28.064 --> 01:08:32.705]  Look how far we've come since your dad 20, 30 years ago would speak out against
[01:08:32.705 --> 01:08:32.905]  I think so.
[01:08:55.094 --> 01:09:03.505]  The state of the world, I mean I don't think we've turned the tide yet, but man, there was really nobody fighting back except a few folks before.
[01:09:03.505 --> 01:09:05.188]  The world has really changed.
[01:09:05.188 --> 01:09:09.634]  What period in time do you think we're in right now, Mike Norris?
[01:09:09.634 --> 01:09:10.855]  We're in the greatest time ever.
[01:09:11.676 --> 01:09:13.778]  I mean, we're making America great again.
[01:09:13.778 --> 01:09:18.522]  We've got great people around just speaking the truth everywhere.
[01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:20.764]  And I think the elites are going down.
[01:09:20.764 --> 01:09:23.707]  And I think this is such an exciting time.
[01:09:23.707 --> 01:09:24.747]  I'm happy to be alive.
[01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:27.270]  I'm proud to witness it.
[01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:28.371]  Making America great again.
[01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:30.291]  What's your dad think of all this?
[01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:31.231]  He loves it.
[01:09:31.231 --> 01:09:31.712]  He loves it.
[01:09:31.712 --> 01:09:32.632]  He's proud.
[01:09:32.632 --> 01:09:35.875]  He loves what President Trump is doing.
[01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:36.875]  He's very engaged.
[01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:43.880]  I just read another article he put out this morning on WorldNetDaily talking about Little Rocket Man.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.461]  So, I love it.
[01:09:45.461 --> 01:09:47.283]  I'm excited.
[01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.584]  I'm optimistic.
[01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:50.405]  At least we're at for the next seven years.
[01:09:51.967 --> 01:09:56.190]  Trump, I think, is over-performing from what I thought, because he's not a dictator.
[01:09:56.190 --> 01:10:00.552]  And the media spun that when I said that yesterday, like, oh, it's a good thing.
[01:10:00.552 --> 01:10:01.492]  I'm saying, no.
[01:10:01.492 --> 01:10:03.253]  All I'm saying is, he's not a dictator.
[01:10:03.253 --> 01:10:04.654]  He's got to work with Congress.
[01:10:04.654 --> 01:10:10.497]  I'm surprised how good a tax deal he got, how much they've controlled the border, the stock market, the jobs.
[01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:11.518]  It's crazy.
[01:10:11.518 --> 01:10:12.659]  No, I love it.
[01:10:12.659 --> 01:10:20.083]  And I think that thing that happened the other day where he brought the cameras into the negotiation on DACA, I thought was an amazing thing for him to do.
[01:10:22.023 --> 01:10:23.064]  I love it.
[01:10:23.064 --> 01:10:24.084]  I'm all in.
[01:10:24.084 --> 01:10:26.624]  I'm just curious to see where everything goes.
[01:10:26.624 --> 01:10:27.745]  Hey, I know that guy.
[01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:29.425]  Yeah, we're showing some of your trailer right now.
[01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:31.666]  We're going to get to the film coming up in the next segment, guys.
[01:10:31.666 --> 01:10:32.666]  Thanks.
[01:10:32.666 --> 01:10:34.126]  Again, Mike Norris is here with us.
[01:10:34.126 --> 01:10:38.507]  You're seeing some on-screen of the film we're going to talk about later, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[01:10:38.507 --> 01:10:41.428]  We're going to get your headset plugged in, too, so you can hear it the next break.
[01:10:43.542 --> 01:10:44.622]  Expanding on that.
[01:10:44.622 --> 01:10:50.503]  I mean, you've made films about the globalists, the New World Order, you've been speaking about it for decades, fighting it.
[01:10:50.503 --> 01:10:53.924]  This is super positive, but they are striking back.
[01:10:53.924 --> 01:10:54.824]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:54.824 --> 01:11:02.246]  And the thing with this film, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, after we did Amerigeddon, that was such a large film, it took a long time, big budget.
[01:11:02.246 --> 01:11:06.887]  What I wanted to do was kind of strip everything down and really get into a story
[01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:19.154]  About what would the world look like if civil war actually took place, everybody factioned up, and a spiritual warfare broke out within our country.
[01:11:19.154 --> 01:11:20.575]  That's already happened!
[01:11:20.575 --> 01:11:21.376]  It's starting!
[01:11:21.376 --> 01:11:29.281]  But you know, a lot of it had to do with the way you were talking years ago about the demonic entities of not only Hollywood, but the government, everything.
[01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:32.664]  Hey, if there's a God, there's a devil.
[01:11:32.664 --> 01:11:35.927]  And the devil is after believers all over the country.
[01:11:35.927 --> 01:11:41.733]  And we've got to be prepared and we've got to be ready to fight for our faith, for our country, for everything.
[01:11:41.733 --> 01:11:43.896]  But that's the thing with Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[01:11:43.896 --> 01:11:47.960]  It deals with the spiritual battle that can take place within us.
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.501]  And we're going to play the trailer and talk about it next segment.
[01:11:50.501 --> 01:12:00.386]  The reason, and I'm glad you raised that, we just got the documents here and we've got all the public statements by Antifa about rising up, taking over, triggering something for martial law.
[01:12:00.386 --> 01:12:01.946]  This is really what they're pushing.
[01:12:01.946 --> 01:12:06.008]  So a very, very timely, timely film.
[01:12:06.008 --> 01:12:11.411]  When you see them failing though on every front, when you see Soros starting to fail, what do you think they're going to do next?
[01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:12.892]  They're not going to give up.
[01:12:12.892 --> 01:12:14.792]  You know, Alex, I wish I knew.
[01:12:14.792 --> 01:12:17.074]  I really wish I knew what they were going to do.
[01:12:17.074 --> 01:12:17.894]  They're not going to give up.
[01:12:19.455 --> 01:12:31.662]  I'm a little nervous to see, you know, what the millennials, so to say, you know, I think they're so brainwashed that they will follow anything without any thought to it.
[01:12:31.662 --> 01:12:35.185]  So a little curious to see what happens with them.
[01:12:36.601 --> 01:12:37.101]  You know what?
[01:12:37.101 --> 01:12:39.583]  We're going to kick their butts everywhere.
[01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:41.505]  We're going to beat them, Alex.
[01:12:41.505 --> 01:12:44.186]  We are going to win this battle.
[01:12:44.186 --> 01:12:44.787]  Absolutely.
[01:12:44.787 --> 01:12:47.989]  And of course, none of us are going to save the world by ourselves without God's help.
[01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.871]  But every little thing we do sends ripples out.
[01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:56.415]  And if you look at, you know, Generation Z is more libertarian, more Christian, more conservative than ever.
[01:12:56.415 --> 01:12:58.177]  So, I mean, it really is the millennials.
[01:12:58.177 --> 01:13:05.542]  A lot of them are great people, but some of them that have been so brainwashed and some of the globalist controllers above them that are fighting so hard because they can see the writing on the wall.
[01:13:05.762 --> 01:13:06.723]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:13:06.723 --> 01:13:07.623]  You know, it was interesting.
[01:13:07.623 --> 01:13:15.208]  I was speaking with a friend of mine, Richard Berry, and what we did with Hunter Wilde was we took it out and we did church screenings all over Texas.
[01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:19.251]  And I was coming back and I was just feeling a little, you know, confused.
[01:13:19.251 --> 01:13:20.211]  Something was going on with Trump.
[01:13:20.211 --> 01:13:21.372]  I don't remember what it was.
[01:13:21.372 --> 01:13:22.593]  And I called him.
[01:13:22.593 --> 01:13:26.476]  This is a guy I've never met in my life, but we spoke on the phone and he's in Orange County.
[01:13:27.256 --> 01:13:32.001]  Full conservative, loves Trump, but he's gotta kind of, you know, keep it under wraps out there.
[01:13:32.001 --> 01:13:34.564]  And I was going, you know, what's going on with all this Twitter?
[01:13:34.564 --> 01:13:36.667]  You think this is really necessary?
[01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:38.068]  And he told me, he goes, you know what?
[01:13:38.068 --> 01:13:38.809]  It's gotta be.
[01:13:38.809 --> 01:13:42.153]  He has got to keep tweeting because he's got to change
[01:13:42.233 --> 01:13:42.373]  That's
[01:13:59.745 --> 01:14:03.408]  But the globalists and the left, they have been leading the narrative and bullying us.
[01:14:03.408 --> 01:14:05.309]  So we've got to get wild on them.
[01:14:05.309 --> 01:14:06.009]  Absolutely.
[01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:07.110]  We've got to fight back.
[01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.310]  Yeah.
[01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:08.011]  We've got to fight back.
[01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:09.452]  And it means fighting everywhere.
[01:14:09.452 --> 01:14:14.715]  On social media, you know, I've got it all over my Facebook feed, you know.
[01:14:14.715 --> 01:14:21.640]  And you can kind of see the shift a little bit where people are now coming out a little more, feeling a little more comfortable going, hey, I support them.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.003]  Because they're trying to bully everybody into not supporting the resurgence of the republic.
[01:14:26.263 --> 01:14:28.064]  The resurgence of real freedom, exactly.
[01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:30.985]  It's all about being heard and not sitting on the fence.
[01:14:30.985 --> 01:14:44.229]  Everybody's got to, and I agree, I think the bullying, they took people's restraint as fear and their kindness for weakness and now that we're coming off the bench, more people are coming in, I'm seeing it cause a bigger backlash, all this censorship.
[01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:47.550]  Did you see where Facebook, Twitter, Google all admit to censoring conservatives?
[01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:55.393]  Libertarians, Trump, they admit to creating systems with algorithms to just block conservatives even being able to talk to each other, period, about the price of tea.
[01:14:56.113 --> 01:14:57.254]  They're going to keep fighting.
[01:14:57.254 --> 01:14:58.294]  They're going to keep fighting.
[01:14:58.294 --> 01:14:59.635]  We're going to keep fighting.
[01:14:59.635 --> 01:15:03.697]  And somewhere we're going to meet, and somewhere we are going to win.
[01:15:03.697 --> 01:15:04.437]  I know it.
[01:15:04.437 --> 01:15:04.837]  I know it.
[01:15:04.837 --> 01:15:07.138]  I'm really excited about what's going on.
[01:15:07.138 --> 01:15:09.239]  I'm really excited.
[01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:10.440]  But you know what?
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.561]  For us, we've just got to keep in it.
[01:15:12.561 --> 01:15:14.422]  We've got to keep spreading the word.
[01:15:14.422 --> 01:15:15.482]  We've got to keep supporting.
[01:15:15.482 --> 01:15:20.705]  Because the Veritas video, exactly, is all these people at meetings and then out at the bars.
[01:15:21.485 --> 01:15:27.530]  In classrooms, how they're going to censor, how they're going to shut us down, how they're going to end our speech, period, while they're denying it publicly.
[01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.352]  This is organized crime in my view.
[01:15:29.352 --> 01:15:30.252]  That's a good point.
[01:15:30.252 --> 01:15:31.954]  It is organized crime.
[01:15:31.954 --> 01:15:32.915]  Mike Norris, stay there.
[01:15:32.915 --> 01:15:35.377]  We're going to get into the film now, when we come back.
[01:15:35.377 --> 01:15:41.682]  On the other side is the Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, now available on DVD at infowarestore.com, so you support what Mike's doing.
[01:15:41.682 --> 01:15:45.085]  We're going to get your headpiece plugged in there, and everything else on the other side.
[01:15:45.325 --> 01:15:54.263]  But support the broadcast and get a great film to share with your family and others at InfoWarsTore.com, the crossroads of Hunter Wilde and Mike Norris Film.
[01:15:54.263 --> 01:15:54.724]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.107 --> 01:16:01.091]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of MyPillow, and like all of you out there, I have problems sleeping.
[01:16:01.091 --> 01:16:08.737]  Pillows would go flat, I would flip-flop all night long, I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache, or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours.
[01:16:08.737 --> 01:16:16.783]  When I invented MyPillow, I wanted it to where you can move the pad and fill to give you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.

[01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:07.167]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:18:07.167 --> 01:18:15.209]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:18:15.209 --> 01:18:21.530]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[01:18:56.883 --> 01:19:00.306]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:00.306 --> 01:19:04.269]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:19:04.269 --> 01:19:05.891]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:19:07.592 --> 01:19:10.133]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:19:10.133 --> 01:19:14.854]  Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:19:14.854 --> 01:19:17.195]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:19:17.195 --> 01:19:24.237]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:31.379]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:37.462]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:19:37.462 --> 01:19:45.105]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:19:45.105 --> 01:19:50.028]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[01:19:50.028 --> 01:19:52.949]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:20:00.143 --> 01:20:13.089]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:13.089 --> 01:20:20.573]  The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, a near-future film of the Second American Civil War triggered by Antifa, a spiritual war.
[01:20:30.476 --> 01:20:33.538]  Everything's falling apart out there, huh?
[01:20:33.538 --> 01:20:35.659]  Preparing for it's one thing.
[01:20:35.659 --> 01:20:39.781]  Living it?
[01:20:39.781 --> 01:20:43.804]  Confusion has got a grip on the town.
[01:20:43.804 --> 01:20:47.866]  Why are we still here?
[01:20:47.866 --> 01:20:54.129]  How do you fight something you can't see?
[01:20:54.129 --> 01:20:56.771]  Prayer.
[01:20:59.653 --> 01:21:02.596]  The world turned their back on God a long time ago.
[01:21:02.596 --> 01:21:05.719]  Is it not possible God said, enough?
[01:21:05.719 --> 01:21:08.362]  Your Bible can't help you now, can it?
[01:21:08.362 --> 01:21:11.505]  You shouldn't have been raptured.
[01:21:11.505 --> 01:21:17.371]  If we close our eyes to what's going on on the outside, we're gonna wake up and the enemy is gonna be right here inside of our gate.
[01:21:17.371 --> 01:21:22.877]  The enemy's not afraid to kill.
[01:21:26.195 --> 01:21:29.498]  Compared to the battle that's to come.
[01:21:29.498 --> 01:21:35.182]  Is he dying?
[01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:39.305]  We fight against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[01:21:39.305 --> 01:21:41.267]  And our only weapon is prayer.
[01:21:41.267 --> 01:21:47.071]  Call out on your God all you want.
[01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:51.434]  But He is mine.
[01:21:51.434 --> 01:21:54.697]  This thing has no authority over you.
[01:21:54.697 --> 01:21:55.358]  Fight it!
[01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:09.753]  So is this kind of like the Pilgrim's Progress?
[01:22:09.753 --> 01:22:10.654]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:22:10.654 --> 01:22:11.454]  But a modern version?
[01:22:11.454 --> 01:22:12.694]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:13.615]  It was kind of fun.
[01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:18.653]  I kind of borrowed from the screw tape letters a little bit.
[01:22:18.653 --> 01:22:24.937]  It's about a demon trying to take the soul of a man with the faith of a mustard seed.
[01:22:24.937 --> 01:22:26.338]  And it's very simple.
[01:22:26.338 --> 01:22:29.339]  I just wanted to really just go tell a story.
[01:22:29.339 --> 01:22:33.282]  I gotta say, it all looks excellent, but it looks first right, the riot scenes and stuff.
[01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:33.582]  Wow.
[01:22:33.582 --> 01:22:34.002]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:34.062 --> 01:22:38.865]  Yeah, no, and you know, I just wanted to create a world of chaos.
[01:22:38.865 --> 01:22:44.789]  And I was trying to think, you know, at the time I was writing this, I'm going, man, you know, the election had just happened.
[01:22:44.789 --> 01:22:47.351]  There was a lot of chaos and confusion going out.
[01:22:47.351 --> 01:22:55.436]  So, you know, I just kind of put the our story in that world, you know, where, you know, the two sides came together and this is what we're left with.
[01:22:56.016 --> 01:22:59.637]  So, spiritual battle, spiritual warfare, it's real.
[01:22:59.637 --> 01:23:11.501]  And these are great to show at your church, or to buy and give to your library, or to show your family, but particularly Christian audiences, but outside of that, excellent new film, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:18.804]  And again, as your purchase there supports the new films that you make, and of course you've directed major movies, TV shows, and Walker, Texas Ranger, you did a lot of those?
[01:23:18.804 --> 01:23:22.285]  Oh yeah, a lot of those, 10 years, that was a great job!
[01:23:22.285 --> 01:23:24.286]  It's amazing, wow, so again,
[01:23:25.848 --> 01:23:35.011]  Getting back into the film, I've been a Christian my whole life, and I've had a personal relationship with Christ, but I'm also a worldly person.
[01:23:35.011 --> 01:23:36.972]  I'm not perfect, and I don't lie about that.
[01:23:36.972 --> 01:23:51.517]  We all have our trials and tribulations, but as I get more immersed in politics and life and the way the world really works, and study things, and have been out to Hollywood at the highest levels like you've been, and have seen behind the scenes, there really are pedophiles, devil worshipers, corruption.
[01:23:51.517 --> 01:23:52.517]  There really is a spirit.
[01:23:52.517 --> 01:23:54.618]  It really is anti-human, and you were here
[01:23:55.538 --> 01:23:58.639]  Three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, you said it's all about to come down.
[01:23:58.639 --> 01:24:04.720]  Last time you were here, a year ago, the pedophilia, the evil, the raping the women, all of it.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.480]  So you grew up into the cool guys.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.641]  You know, Steve McQueen taught you how to ride a motorcycle because he was one of your dad's students.
[01:24:10.641 --> 01:24:12.841]  People forget how long your dad's been around the phenomenon.
[01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:15.942]  He looks like he's 50, but you know, he's been around forever.
[01:24:15.942 --> 01:24:20.283]  And so now you just said, I don't want to get into it, but man, they're devil worshipers, they're pedophiles.
[01:24:20.283 --> 01:24:22.183]  Now that so much has come out, you want to talk about that?
[01:24:22.863 --> 01:24:26.225]  You know, that's just crazy what's happening with Hollywood right now.
[01:24:26.225 --> 01:24:28.906]  But you broke it here years ago!
[01:24:28.906 --> 01:24:31.427]  Yeah, but little did I know.
[01:24:31.427 --> 01:24:35.029]  We were just talking and that was my view from what I've seen.
[01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:38.150]  And sure enough, I mean, the lid's just blown off of Hollywood.
[01:24:40.287 --> 01:24:45.049]  You know, I think with everything, with our country, with Hollywood, with everything... Things are being revealed.
[01:24:45.049 --> 01:24:51.911]  Things are being revealed, and I think it's very important, but with things being revealed, we'll be able to, you know, make new again.
[01:24:51.911 --> 01:24:54.251]  I really believe we'll be able to make new again.
[01:24:54.251 --> 01:24:55.812]  Look, Hollywood's Hollywood.
[01:24:55.812 --> 01:24:57.392]  I don't deal with it.
[01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:58.333]  I don't want to deal with it.
[01:24:58.333 --> 01:25:03.834]  The film we did, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, Texas crew, Texas cast, everything was Texas.
[01:25:05.595 --> 01:25:07.717]  It doesn't have the hundred million dollar budgets, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:07.717 --> 01:25:16.424]  It's the story and the people that are involved and that's what we're growing here as New Independent Center and so many New Independent Christian films now are dwarfing Hollywood.
[01:25:16.424 --> 01:25:17.625]  Yeah, and you know what?
[01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:21.468]  I didn't want to fake anything or pretend anything on this movie.
[01:25:21.468 --> 01:25:22.208]  It is what it is.
[01:25:22.208 --> 01:25:23.830]  It's a very independent film.
[01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:28.333]  We didn't do the big drone shots to make a little budget film look big or anything like that.
[01:25:28.333 --> 01:25:31.175]  We're just telling a story about spiritual warfare.
[01:25:31.175 --> 01:25:32.917]  I can't wait to watch it because it just came in today.
[01:25:33.137 --> 01:25:41.320]  And you know what's really cool is this is one of the first movies that my dad watched, then he re-watched, and he says, son, what can I do to help you?
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:48.203]  I said, hey, if you could just say anything, you know, about the film and we can help put help us put it out there, that would be great.
[01:25:48.203 --> 01:25:52.385]  And sure enough, he did this great video for us saying, hey, this one of the finest films I've seen.
[01:25:52.585 --> 01:25:53.265]  Do we have that video?
[01:25:53.265 --> 01:25:54.186]  Did we load that video, man?
[01:25:54.186 --> 01:25:54.606]  Yeah, you got it.
[01:25:54.606 --> 01:25:55.967]  Chuck Norris approved.
[01:25:55.967 --> 01:25:59.829]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play Chuck Norris approved The Crossroads of Hunter Walton.
[01:25:59.829 --> 01:26:02.230]  I should have started the whole interview with that, baby.
[01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:04.431]  I've got a list here of some of the videos we're going to be playing.
[01:26:04.431 --> 01:26:06.612]  Go ahead and roll that.
[01:26:06.612 --> 01:26:09.473]  Oh, my special little demon.
[01:26:09.473 --> 01:26:16.737]  You've managed a little fear and chaos, and yet here you sit, alone.
[01:26:16.737 --> 01:26:20.919]  Chaos and fear, or a time-honored operative's tool.
[01:26:22.561 --> 01:26:32.288]  So a panic, doubt, pride, lust, political distractions, these are but the afterthoughts of good field operations.
[01:26:32.288 --> 01:26:34.150]  Is this all you desire?
[01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:37.432]  I have spent a millennia in the field!
[01:26:37.432 --> 01:26:40.955]  A millennia is but a speck of time!
[01:26:40.955 --> 01:26:46.339]  No!
[01:26:46.339 --> 01:26:47.200]  What am I doing wrong?
[01:26:48.798 --> 01:26:53.422]  Aside from using time and space travel and dimension alteration with the finesse of a three-legged dog?
[01:26:53.422 --> 01:26:56.745]  All right.
[01:26:56.745 --> 01:26:57.105]  Show me.
[01:26:57.105 --> 01:26:59.267]  Anything.
[01:26:59.267 --> 01:27:03.110]  Some more.
[01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:05.893]  Collective.
[01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:11.798]  Targets, like Hunter Wilde, thrive on chaos.
[01:27:13.078 --> 01:27:21.647]  It creates an adrenaline rush which simply focuses him, not on us.
[01:27:21.647 --> 01:27:24.550]  The more you fling at him, the less likely he is to succumb.
[01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:28.054]  That will not be enough to drag him back to your cage.
[01:27:28.054 --> 01:27:32.419]  I want to keep you down, but you've chosen a very tricky human.
[01:27:34.071 --> 01:27:35.232]  And again, that's another part.
[01:27:35.232 --> 01:27:39.035]  We're going to come back with Chuck Norris of Proven Chuck Norris talking about the film.
[01:27:39.035 --> 01:27:45.019]  That's kind of the screw tape letter angle of the demons, which is riveting, figuring out how to manipulate and control humans.
[01:27:45.019 --> 01:27:49.882]  Yeah, it's what they talk about, the things that they use to create chaos.
[01:27:49.882 --> 01:27:52.604]  They use political distractions.
[01:27:52.604 --> 01:27:53.585]  They use pride.
[01:27:53.585 --> 01:28:01.110]  They use all these things that infiltrates the believer or just the Americans that kind of sends them off kilter a little bit.
[01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:02.351]  So, yeah, it's.
[01:28:03.692 --> 01:28:08.214]  Well, this is a film I'm definitely going to show my children, particularly, because they love God.
[01:28:08.214 --> 01:28:14.558]  You know, I try to talk about God, we try to read from the Bible, but they still just get caught up in the world, and I can tell that's really what they need.
[01:28:14.558 --> 01:28:15.178]  Yeah.
[01:28:15.178 --> 01:28:17.239]  No, you know, that's what's happening.
[01:28:17.239 --> 01:28:18.780]  You know, the kids are just getting, you
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:25.485]  Inundated with so much information, I just think they're having a hard time processing it.
[01:28:25.485 --> 01:28:29.428]  You know, my kids are the same way, even though they've got a pretty good grip on things.
[01:28:29.428 --> 01:28:31.630]  But also, my daughter Greta is in this movie.
[01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:33.051]  She was in Amerigeddon.
[01:28:33.051 --> 01:28:35.633]  She was part of the ranch, and she's also in this.
[01:28:35.633 --> 01:28:40.157]  She plays a kind of a girl I pick up on the way back to Crossroads.
[01:28:40.797 --> 01:28:41.578]  She's great.
[01:28:41.578 --> 01:28:42.179]  She's great.
[01:28:42.179 --> 01:28:42.699]  We had a fun time.
[01:28:42.699 --> 01:28:46.704]  Well, Mike Norris, an awesome fellow Texan, right here.
[01:28:46.704 --> 01:28:50.028]  By way of Oklahoma, back to L.A., back to Texas.
[01:28:50.028 --> 01:28:51.990]  Because, you know, Oklahoma should be part of Texas.
[01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:53.692]  Chuck Norris is a Texan.
[01:28:53.692 --> 01:28:54.473]  Just North Texas.
[01:28:56.072 --> 01:28:56.993]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:56.993 --> 01:28:59.394]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.394 --> 01:29:07.520]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.461]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:09.461 --> 01:29:13.163]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:29:13.163 --> 01:29:17.887]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:29:17.887 --> 01:29:22.350]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.990]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:29:26.512 --> 01:29:27.313]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:29:27.313 --> 01:29:29.114]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:30.776]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:30.776 --> 01:29:33.598]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:29:33.598 --> 01:29:35.880]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.403]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:29:40.403 --> 01:29:44.347]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:29:44.347 --> 01:29:48.110]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[01:29:57.353 --> 01:30:02.496]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:30:02.496 --> 01:30:07.259]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:30:07.259 --> 01:30:15.964]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:30:15.964 --> 01:30:19.206]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[01:30:19.446 --> 01:30:24.709]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:32.014]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:30:32.014 --> 01:30:35.917]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:30:35.917 --> 01:30:40.640]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:44.222]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[01:30:44.883 --> 01:30:48.732]  Find a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:30:48.732 --> 01:30:52.941]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[01:30:52.941 --> 01:30:54.244]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:56.952 --> 01:31:05.217]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.

[01:31:12.981 --> 01:31:20.505]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:31:20.905 --> 01:31:25.990]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:32.095]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:31:32.095 --> 01:31:39.902]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:31:39.902 --> 01:31:46.768]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:31:46.768 --> 01:31:47.909]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:50.491]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:31:56.557 --> 01:32:01.221]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride-free products.
[01:32:01.221 --> 01:32:08.868]  InfoWarsLife brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano-silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[01:32:08.868 --> 01:32:12.832]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:19.218]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[01:32:19.218 --> 01:32:25.825]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[01:32:25.825 --> 01:32:35.975]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:32:36.195 --> 01:32:38.356]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:18.463 --> 01:33:34.372]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:34.372 --> 01:33:41.876]  If we close our eyes to what's going on on the outside, we're gonna wake up and the enemy is gonna be right here inside of our gate.
[01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:50.541]  You ever think death is better than this?
[01:34:28.404 --> 01:34:29.113]  Bizarre!
[01:35:01.630 --> 01:35:04.031]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here.
[01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:05.371]  So much breaking behind the scenes.
[01:35:05.371 --> 01:35:07.752]  Sorry I got in late to the studio here.
[01:35:07.752 --> 01:35:11.874]  But we're dealing with massive censorship taking place all over the country, all over the world.
[01:35:11.874 --> 01:35:12.974]  And it's being exposed.
[01:35:12.974 --> 01:35:16.816]  Mike Norris, filmmaker, great Patriots, riding shotgun with me.
[01:35:16.816 --> 01:35:22.238]  He was telling me during the break about a really exciting documentary film coming out that's going to be coming to Austin.
[01:35:22.238 --> 01:35:24.579]  And I also want to get into, if you want to, about the Snake River.
[01:35:24.579 --> 01:35:25.799]  Who didn't want to talk about that?
[01:35:25.799 --> 01:35:26.379]  But look at this.
[01:35:26.379 --> 01:35:27.860]  He's joining us next hour.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.781]  Twitter caught silencing O'Keefe.
[01:35:30.774 --> 01:35:39.717]  Amid censorship expose with O'Keefe suspension, Twitter confirms authenticity of Project Veritas videos.
[01:35:39.717 --> 01:35:48.780]  Well, they have congressional hearings saying they want to censor everybody and they're doing it and that they're spying on the president on Twitter with his private messages.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.901]  I mean, these people, this is a coup.
[01:35:50.901 --> 01:35:54.402]  The big tech companies have basically brainwashed a bunch of people.
[01:35:54.402 --> 01:35:55.763]  They finance the universities.
[01:35:56.443 --> 01:36:06.688]  And then they bring them out and put them in charge of a huge un-American takeover of massive censorship and they're on video having power trips, Mike Norris.
[01:36:06.688 --> 01:36:07.889]  I'm blown away by this.
[01:36:07.889 --> 01:36:13.171]  Thank God for Project Veritas to be uncovering all this stuff.
[01:36:13.171 --> 01:36:13.872]  And I'll tell you what.
[01:36:14.412 --> 01:36:17.495]  Everybody's got to watch what they say no matter where they're at.
[01:36:17.495 --> 01:36:18.857]  Because somebody's listening.
[01:36:18.857 --> 01:36:20.679]  On my iPad I got tape over everything.
[01:36:20.679 --> 01:36:22.981]  I tape on my iPhone.
[01:36:22.981 --> 01:36:24.143]  I protect myself.
[01:36:24.143 --> 01:36:26.906]  I'm very careful about what I say and when I say it.
[01:36:26.906 --> 01:36:32.892]  Well I remember 18 years ago having film crews inside my house and they go, why do you have your
[01:36:32.892 --> 01:36:33.533]  We're good to go.
[01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:51.132]  Yeah, you know, it was interesting when I was driving up here today.
[01:36:51.132 --> 01:36:57.875]  You know, I was thinking back to 20, 25 years ago when you first, or 30 years ago when you first got started.
[01:36:57.875 --> 01:37:07.400]  And things you're saying, like I was saying Alex, exciting time because all this stuff you've talked about for all these years is happening right now.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.081]  Way ahead of schedule of what you've said.
[01:37:11.362 --> 01:37:14.988]  I'm just very excited to see how this all shakes out.
[01:37:14.988 --> 01:37:16.711]  It's a little scary.
[01:37:16.711 --> 01:37:17.872]  It's exciting.
[01:37:17.872 --> 01:37:19.655]  But here we are, you know, we got to deal with it.
[01:37:20.666 --> 01:37:23.049]  Mike Norris is our guest here in studio.
[01:37:23.049 --> 01:37:34.342]  I've got so much news to get to here, but you've always got a lot of interesting stuff going on in your life, your perspective, stories that you've heard about, things you've personally witnessed.
[01:37:34.342 --> 01:37:40.028]  I'm trying to be positive because there is a lot of positive news out here as well, but if you pull back from it...
[01:37:41.016 --> 01:37:47.018]  And you see how we just put up with all the censorship and put up with all the tyranny.
[01:37:47.018 --> 01:37:48.559]  What do we do about all this?
[01:37:48.559 --> 01:37:49.820]  I shoot Alex.
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:55.062]  I, you know, I think individually we, you know, knowledge is power.
[01:37:55.062 --> 01:37:58.543]  I think that's one thing that people really need to understand is knowledge is power.
[01:37:58.543 --> 01:37:59.423]  So they need to read.
[01:37:59.423 --> 01:38:00.664]  They need to be informed.
[01:38:01.344 --> 01:38:08.913]  Um, you know, and I'm really lucky that I've got a pretty, a really amazing group of men around me that are very knowledgeable.
[01:38:08.913 --> 01:38:13.599]  Gary Haven, you know, this is somebody I could go to going, you know, what's going on, Gary?
[01:38:13.599 --> 01:38:16.442]  And he'll strip it all down to where I can understand.
[01:38:16.442 --> 01:38:22.446]  And then there's the footage of him with the crew landing on grass runways during a hurricane to help people in Haiti, the first airplane in.
[01:38:22.446 --> 01:38:24.667]  And later in the day, somebody dies trying to do what he did.
[01:38:24.667 --> 01:38:28.110]  And I'm like, wow, the footage we've got is incredible.
[01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:28.870]  Oh, I know.
[01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:33.573]  And he was in a standoff, I think, with the United Nations or something.
[01:38:33.573 --> 01:38:34.574]  I saw some pictures.
[01:38:34.574 --> 01:38:35.754]  Because I called him up.
[01:38:35.754 --> 01:38:36.775]  I go, hey, what's going on, Gary?
[01:38:36.775 --> 01:38:41.038]  He goes, well, I'm in a standoff with the UN right now and some cartel people.
[01:38:41.038 --> 01:38:42.179]  I'm going, what?
[01:38:42.919 --> 01:38:45.960]  Never a boring moment with Gary Haven.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.160]  He doesn't even make a big deal about it.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:47.720]  No.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.341]  Oh, never.
[01:38:48.341 --> 01:38:51.842]  He just got his cigar and he's ready to go.
[01:38:51.842 --> 01:38:53.682]  You know, he's an amazing, amazing man.
[01:38:53.682 --> 01:39:01.964]  There's two men that have really shaped my thinking, my ideology, and that's Gary and my dad.
[01:39:01.964 --> 01:39:10.527]  Those are two men that I look up to so much, but Gary, just so smart, so well-versed in all this stuff, and he's the one that really
[01:39:11.307 --> 01:39:11.468]  Yeah.
[01:39:28.232 --> 01:39:29.833]  So much money, and what is he doing?
[01:39:29.833 --> 01:39:31.334]  He's trying to save the world.
[01:39:31.334 --> 01:39:38.337]  And all he does is direct action, food, medicine to people all over the Caribbean, you name it, other places behind the scenes.
[01:39:38.337 --> 01:39:39.658]  He directly is delivering.
[01:39:39.658 --> 01:39:40.998]  He knows it's happening.
[01:39:40.998 --> 01:39:41.618]  Absolutely.
[01:39:41.618 --> 01:39:46.321]  I mean, he fills up his own airplanes, gets an army of people together, and they head out.
[01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:50.102]  They were all in Haiti, Puerto Rico.
[01:39:50.102 --> 01:39:52.043]  He's the man.
[01:39:52.043 --> 01:39:55.365]  It's so exciting to just kind of go into his orbit and see.
[01:39:55.365 --> 01:39:56.626]  Look at this landing right here.
[01:39:56.626 --> 01:39:56.946]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:57.826 --> 01:39:59.326]  Yeah.
[01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:00.507]  And he's the best pilot.
[01:40:00.507 --> 01:40:02.247]  He is the best pilot I've ever seen.
[01:40:02.247 --> 01:40:02.747]  There he is!
[01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:03.887]  Look at him!
[01:40:03.887 --> 01:40:14.829]  You know, earlier I had the best crew ever, but I get mad at myself because I was so excited about this film coming out, and then it just got here like yesterday, and then I wanted to have banners for it, and promos, and I kind of just walking up for the show, and like, what clip?
[01:40:14.829 --> 01:40:15.349]  This clip?
[01:40:15.349 --> 01:40:17.370]  Oh, and you know, it's my fault we have some train wrecks.
[01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:24.671]  But that's the fun part about it, is it's live radio and live TV, day after day, you know, just growing across the country.
[01:40:24.671 --> 01:40:25.411]  And again, it's not about
[01:40:26.434 --> 01:40:28.475]  Giving credit to Infowars or anybody else.
[01:40:28.475 --> 01:40:30.996]  It's about saying we're right.
[01:40:30.996 --> 01:40:33.337]  We really know what we're talking about.
[01:40:33.337 --> 01:40:34.657]  But now we've got the banners up.
[01:40:34.657 --> 01:40:37.538]  This is what a second American Civil War would look like.
[01:40:37.538 --> 01:40:42.280]  Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, a Mike Norris film, now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.262]  And listen, when you get excited about films, folks, we sell tens of thousands of them.
[01:40:46.262 --> 01:40:47.523]  That sounds like a lot of money.
[01:40:47.523 --> 01:40:50.744]  It's not when you're trying to pay for a film, trying to produce it.
[01:40:50.744 --> 01:40:53.925]  It's not when you are trying to fund an operation like this.
[01:40:53.925 --> 01:40:55.786]  Everybody listening, if you'll just commit
[01:40:56.366 --> 01:40:58.487]  And no, this is the group they're trying to censor.
[01:40:58.487 --> 01:41:00.348]  The people we have on, they're trying to block.
[01:41:00.348 --> 01:41:13.356]  And when you grow a new film industry that's based on good, decent American and Christian values, when you grow a radio slash TV program like this that isn't perfect, but has good intentions and is having victories, you change the world.
[01:41:13.356 --> 01:41:16.317]  And I know you know this, but we don't get money from big corporations.
[01:41:16.317 --> 01:41:17.598]  We don't get money from Soros.
[01:41:17.598 --> 01:41:18.619]  We don't get government money.
[01:41:19.502 --> 01:41:24.086]  What we get here is patriots supporting us and getting high-quality products.
[01:41:24.086 --> 01:41:27.869]  And if you just vote with your dollars, we'll continue to change the world.
[01:41:27.869 --> 01:41:31.272]  We've got also the new product in, Immune Wall.
[01:41:31.272 --> 01:41:36.877]  And it's got the well-immune, patented, proven to massively boost your immune system naturally.
[01:41:36.877 --> 01:41:41.962]  It's also got the olive leaf extract concentrated, going back to ancient times that the Romans used when they were sick.
[01:41:42.202 --> 01:41:44.163]  Now, the big studies, they know how incredible it is.

[01:44:59.896 --> 01:45:01.819]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:45:01.819 --> 01:45:12.331]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:45:12.331 --> 01:45:15.695]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:45:16.155 --> 01:45:16.415]  Absolutely.
[01:45:38.929 --> 01:45:51.825]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back.
[01:45:57.699 --> 01:46:00.300]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:14.889]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:46:14.889 --> 01:46:22.473]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:46:22.993 --> 01:46:34.142]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:46:34.142 --> 01:46:40.408]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.

[01:47:38.484 --> 01:47:41.186]  Here's a little piece of video of that.
[01:47:41.186 --> 01:47:42.767]  Can I have this?
[01:47:42.767 --> 01:47:45.268]  That's my last sea-force water.
[01:47:48.732 --> 01:47:50.114]  I got a brand new bottle of Voss.
[01:47:50.114 --> 01:47:51.096]  You can have it.
[01:47:51.096 --> 01:47:52.317]  No.
[01:47:52.317 --> 01:47:52.818]  Fiji.
[01:47:52.818 --> 01:47:54.260]  It's yours.
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.142]  No.
[01:47:55.142 --> 01:47:55.863]  Billimore.
[01:47:55.863 --> 01:47:56.424]  No.
[01:47:56.424 --> 01:47:56.964]  Accordion.
[01:47:56.964 --> 01:47:57.385]  No.
[01:47:57.385 --> 01:47:58.006]  Avion.
[01:47:58.006 --> 01:47:58.346]  No.
[01:47:58.346 --> 01:48:00.830]  I want my seat, Mars!
[01:48:03.268 --> 01:48:07.151]  No one gets in the way of me and my C-Force.
[01:48:07.151 --> 01:48:09.952]  Again, tell us about C-Force.
[01:48:09.952 --> 01:48:10.873]  It's gotten really popular.
[01:48:10.873 --> 01:48:12.374]  That's water off your dad's ranch.
[01:48:12.374 --> 01:48:15.536]  Yeah, you know, my dad was out on the ranch one day.
[01:48:15.536 --> 01:48:17.577]  He saw a snake in the ground.
[01:48:17.577 --> 01:48:21.340]  He punched the snake, went down so deep, up popped a thing of water.
[01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:23.741]  Nah, just kidding.
[01:48:23.741 --> 01:48:24.982]  You mean Hillary Clinton came out?
[01:48:26.443 --> 01:48:27.685]  Your dad punched Hillary Clinton in the face?
[01:48:27.685 --> 01:48:29.006]  Yeah, right in the face.
[01:48:29.006 --> 01:48:31.009]  And out came the water.
[01:48:31.009 --> 01:48:39.480]  You know, about in 2015, they were drilling for a well, and they ended up hitting an aquifer on his ranch that was spitting out about 190,000 gallons a day.
[01:48:41.842 --> 01:48:44.564]  So, they started bottling it.
[01:48:44.564 --> 01:48:50.828]  They put a line of 8,000 feet, built a bottling plant, and so they've got Seaforest going out.
[01:48:50.828 --> 01:48:53.969]  I think it's in 15 states now.
[01:48:53.969 --> 01:48:54.690]  It's amazing.
[01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:56.731]  It's a great tasting water.
[01:48:56.731 --> 01:48:58.252]  It's my dad and Gina's.
[01:48:58.252 --> 01:49:00.013]  It's their water.
[01:49:00.013 --> 01:49:05.196]  So, yeah, it was really funny because when we were doing CrossFit... And I can drink Chuck Norris water.
[01:49:05.256 --> 01:49:06.136]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:06.136 --> 01:49:14.701]  But when we were doing Crossroads of Hunter Wild, we had lunch with them one day and they're going, yeah, a lot of people are doing these viral videos for us.
[01:49:14.701 --> 01:49:16.582]  And I go, shoot, we're filming tomorrow.
[01:49:16.582 --> 01:49:17.842]  Let me do one.
[01:49:17.842 --> 01:49:24.466]  And so we did this commercial and they're putting it out here in the next couple of weeks on a big national campaign.
[01:49:24.466 --> 01:49:25.266]  So it was funny.
[01:49:25.266 --> 01:49:25.806]  It was funny.
[01:49:25.806 --> 01:49:26.747]  We had a good time doing it.
[01:49:26.747 --> 01:49:28.168]  And it's my daughter Greta right there.
[01:49:29.628 --> 01:49:31.149]  So we're getting a first look right now.
[01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:34.950]  Yeah, actually this is the first time it's ever been seen right here on your show.
[01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:37.351]  The premiere of Seaforest Water.
[01:49:37.351 --> 01:49:38.011]  Yeah.
[01:49:38.011 --> 01:49:39.232]  But anyway, it was great.
[01:49:39.232 --> 01:49:41.532]  It's a great water.
[01:49:41.532 --> 01:49:44.534]  Part of the proceeds go to his Kickstart Foundation.
[01:49:44.534 --> 01:49:45.974]  Which is great for kids.
[01:49:45.974 --> 01:49:46.554]  It's great.
[01:49:46.554 --> 01:49:51.196]  I had my friend, we're going to talk about this later, Eddie Braun, who jumped the Snake River Canyon.
[01:49:52.976 --> 01:49:55.597]  I know him from out in Hollywood, one of the most famous stunt guys out there.
[01:49:55.597 --> 01:49:56.418]  Eddie's an amazing, amazing guy.
[01:49:56.418 --> 01:49:58.378]  He's been a great friend of mine for a long time.
[01:49:58.378 --> 01:49:59.299]  Evel Knievel couldn't do that.
[01:49:59.299 --> 01:49:59.699]  Eddie built a rocket.
[01:50:11.543 --> 01:50:15.866]  And to exact specs is what Evil's Rocket was.
[01:50:15.866 --> 01:50:17.467]  And he jumped the Snake River.
[01:50:17.467 --> 01:50:27.672]  Now, Good Morning America, there was going to be a big, huge media thing and Good Morning America was out there, but that was the day that the French terrorist attack happened and it took all the media away.
[01:50:27.672 --> 01:50:28.413]  Eagles of Death.
[01:50:28.413 --> 01:50:29.153]  Yeah.
[01:50:29.153 --> 01:50:30.254]  And Eddie said, forget it.
[01:50:30.254 --> 01:50:31.555]  I'm still going.
[01:50:31.555 --> 01:50:35.517]  And what he did was he took all the footage and made an amazing documentary.
[01:50:35.897 --> 01:50:40.379]  What's incredible is 30, 40 years ago, Jumping the Snake River or trying to was like the biggest thing ever.
[01:50:40.379 --> 01:50:41.859]  Now it's like, ah, no big deal.
[01:50:41.859 --> 01:50:42.479]  You can't do it.
[01:50:42.479 --> 01:50:43.560]  And then he does it, though.
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.001]  Zero to 400 miles in two seconds.
[01:50:48.001 --> 01:50:49.462]  Zero to 400 miles an hour.
[01:50:49.462 --> 01:50:50.682]  Did he black out?
[01:50:50.682 --> 01:50:51.602]  No, he did it.
[01:50:51.602 --> 01:50:55.364]  And it's an amazing, this movie he did, Stuntman, it's an amazing movie.
[01:50:55.364 --> 01:50:58.985]  I remember I had dinner one time with Eddie Braun and some folks.
[01:50:59.525 --> 01:51:09.271]  And they were talking about stories about guys dying, like, jump the car and then it crushes and it like, you know, cuts their head off, or just all this insane stories about, wow, these stuntmen are amazing.
[01:51:09.271 --> 01:51:10.932]  Yeah, that happened on Walker.
[01:51:10.932 --> 01:51:17.236]  Eddie was driving a car on Walker, jumping a car, and he looked over to the guy next to him and he goes, hey,
[01:51:17.836 --> 01:51:19.877]  This may hurt, but it won't kill you.
[01:51:19.877 --> 01:51:22.739]  It killed him, unfortunately, up at Joe Poole Lake in Dallas.
[01:51:22.739 --> 01:51:26.921]  And they did a big car stunt, and Eddie broke his back.
[01:51:26.921 --> 01:51:27.581]  It was brutal.
[01:51:27.581 --> 01:51:28.702]  And he was telling that story, too.
[01:51:28.702 --> 01:51:30.002]  So the blood was just gushing out of his nose?
[01:51:30.002 --> 01:51:30.623]  Yeah.
[01:51:30.623 --> 01:51:31.403]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:51:31.403 --> 01:51:32.063]  That was the story.
[01:51:32.063 --> 01:51:32.764]  That's the story.
[01:51:32.764 --> 01:51:33.444]  Well, then retell it.
[01:51:33.564 --> 01:51:34.684]  Yeah, no.
[01:51:34.684 --> 01:51:38.265]  On Walker, Texas Ranger, we were doing a big stunt.
[01:51:38.265 --> 01:51:40.446]  And the car, you know, was jumping over something.
[01:51:40.446 --> 01:51:42.087]  I can't remember what it is exactly.
[01:51:42.087 --> 01:51:43.787]  But Eddie's driving the car.
[01:51:43.787 --> 01:51:45.828]  Charlie Skeen is next to him.
[01:51:45.828 --> 01:51:47.508]  And like I said, Eddie... That was it.
[01:51:47.508 --> 01:51:48.329]  Charlie Skeen.
[01:51:48.329 --> 01:51:49.469]  Charlie Skeen.
[01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:49.789]  Yeah.
[01:51:49.789 --> 01:51:50.629]  Yeah.
[01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:53.870]  And he goes, ah, this is going to hurt, but it won't kill you.
[01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:55.371]  And Eddie hit the thing.
[01:51:55.371 --> 01:52:00.012]  I think he flew about 150 feet in the air and crashed and looked over and Charlie was dead.
[01:52:00.012 --> 01:52:01.833]  But he had a heart attack or something like that.
[01:52:02.993 --> 01:52:04.054]  I don't think it was from the MTF.
[01:52:04.054 --> 01:52:06.095]  Sure, that's what it was, the blood was pouring out of his eyes.
[01:52:06.095 --> 01:52:06.295]  Yeah.
[01:52:06.295 --> 01:52:10.237]  And there was another guy, though, they told some other stories, somebody else got their head chopped off in another event.
[01:52:10.237 --> 01:52:14.840]  Yeah, that was on another one of my dad's movies, uh, Missing in Action, I think.
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:16.781]  Yeah, I'm remembering now.
[01:52:16.781 --> 01:52:19.162]  You're sitting there eating swordfish and rice and...
[01:52:19.502 --> 01:52:20.863]  They're getting their heads cut off.
[01:52:20.863 --> 01:52:22.804]  You're like, I'm really glad I have my radio job.
[01:52:22.804 --> 01:52:24.044]  Yeah, just kidding.
[01:52:24.044 --> 01:52:26.105]  But it's, you know what, it's safe.
[01:52:26.105 --> 01:52:28.827]  You know, my brother was the stunt coordinator on Warner.
[01:52:28.827 --> 01:52:30.107]  It's safe until you die.
[01:52:30.107 --> 01:52:31.248]  It's safe until you die.
[01:52:31.248 --> 01:52:34.009]  But, you know, you just got to be careful.
[01:52:34.009 --> 01:52:35.050]  It's a dangerous business.
[01:52:35.050 --> 01:52:36.170]  Being a stuntman is dangerous.
[01:52:36.170 --> 01:52:37.911]  Didn't your dad do a lot of his own stunts?
[01:52:37.911 --> 01:52:38.772]  He did.
[01:52:38.772 --> 01:52:41.193]  But, you know, he got to the point where he's like,
[01:52:41.693 --> 01:52:42.835]  Well, why am I doing this?
[01:52:42.835 --> 01:52:43.676]  I don't have to do this.
[01:52:43.676 --> 01:52:55.672]  I got a great double that looks just like me, and so my dad would do the master shots and do the fights, but, you know, if somebody's driving by or something, he's like, you know what, let these stuntmen do it and let them make some money.
[01:52:56.653 --> 01:53:00.637]  Boy, I tell ya, let me just think of that movie intro.
[01:53:00.637 --> 01:53:02.179]  You know, I'd die for a living on TV.
[01:53:02.179 --> 01:53:03.840]  It's just crazy.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:08.825]  Are the stuntmen, and there's stuntwomen as well, just saying men is not sexist or evil.
[01:53:08.825 --> 01:53:10.867]  Men existing is bad.
[01:53:10.867 --> 01:53:11.969]  Is it as dangerous as it used to be?
[01:53:11.969 --> 01:53:14.091]  It seems like with more of the graphics and computers.
[01:53:15.772 --> 01:53:23.841]  Yeah, you know what, I don't want to say it's, you know, I think a lot of it is, I think they're pushing the envelope a lot further also now.
[01:53:23.841 --> 01:53:29.507]  Just the way Hollywood is, they're constantly pushing the envelope on action and driving.
[01:53:29.507 --> 01:53:34.813]  I mean, that movie Baby Driver and things like that, that's still the car doing the stunts.
[01:53:36.094 --> 01:53:37.295]  It's a it's dangerous.
[01:53:37.295 --> 01:53:45.580]  It's very dangerous, but stuntmen are a very highly highly trained breed of people That take it very serious.
[01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:54.946]  I was here with my Eddie was here in Dallas last week doing a Ford commercial and He's you know I forgot how
[01:53:56.247 --> 01:53:58.148]  How detailed they are on safety.
[01:53:58.148 --> 01:53:59.589]  Everything's about safety.
[01:53:59.589 --> 01:54:00.870]  Sure, because it's dangerous what they're doing.
[01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:01.411]  Yeah.
[01:54:01.411 --> 01:54:02.131]  No, absolutely.
[01:54:02.131 --> 01:54:03.132]  They've gotten better about it.
[01:54:03.132 --> 01:54:08.055]  Not only dangerous for the stuntman, but also for the crew, all the people around.
[01:54:08.055 --> 01:54:09.356]  That's very dangerous as well.
[01:54:09.356 --> 01:54:11.017]  So, safety's paramount.
[01:54:11.017 --> 01:54:13.118]  But pushing human potential is what it's all about.
[01:54:13.118 --> 01:54:15.120]  Some of the last trailblazers out there.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:16.601]  In fact, you were telling me you guys are going to come to town.
[01:54:16.601 --> 01:54:17.761]  We're talking about Southwest.
[01:54:17.761 --> 01:54:18.802]  We'll definitely hang out for that.
[01:54:18.802 --> 01:54:20.023]  Yeah.
[01:54:20.023 --> 01:54:21.064]  Eddie Braun's coming down here.
[01:54:21.064 --> 01:54:23.465]  He's screening his movie down here in Austin.
[01:54:23.465 --> 01:54:25.166]  He's going to have a whole array of
[01:54:26.747 --> 01:54:28.088]  Crazy people coming with him.
[01:54:28.088 --> 01:54:29.389]  But it's going to be a big party.
[01:54:29.389 --> 01:54:30.010]  We're going to have fun.
[01:54:30.010 --> 01:54:30.850]  We're going to have a good time.
[01:54:30.850 --> 01:54:34.353]  What's cool in Hollywood, though, is everybody likes the Hollywood stars.
[01:54:34.353 --> 01:54:38.595]  But in Hollywood, the cool people, it's the stunt people that are the stars.
[01:54:38.595 --> 01:54:39.016]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:39.016 --> 01:54:40.296]  Like at a party or an event.
[01:54:40.296 --> 01:54:41.397]  That's everybody wants to talk to.
[01:54:41.397 --> 01:54:42.198]  Absolutely.
[01:54:42.198 --> 01:54:45.160]  You know, and it's been part of our world for forever.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:49.423]  My brother, Eric, he's he's one of the top stunt coordinators in the business.
[01:54:49.423 --> 01:54:52.084]  He's doing Hawaii Five-0 right now in Hawaii.
[01:54:52.084 --> 01:54:54.006]  And he's amazing.
[01:54:54.006 --> 01:54:55.507]  He's... That's a rough job.
[01:54:56.627 --> 01:54:57.388]  Yeah.
[01:54:57.388 --> 01:54:59.029]  Yeah, spending nine months a year in Hawaii.
[01:54:59.029 --> 01:54:59.869]  Oh, it's horrible.
[01:54:59.869 --> 01:55:03.131]  Man, I was out there on Kauai, those big cliffs.
[01:55:03.131 --> 01:55:05.453]  You're right on the side where there's no civilization.
[01:55:05.453 --> 01:55:05.933]  Yep.
[01:55:05.933 --> 01:55:07.834]  And the Mali Coast, whatever, like in a rubber boat.
[01:55:07.834 --> 01:55:09.676]  I was like, man, this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
[01:55:09.676 --> 01:55:11.197]  Going into those caves.
[01:55:11.197 --> 01:55:11.957]  Yeah.
[01:55:11.957 --> 01:55:12.257]  Yeah.
[01:55:12.257 --> 01:55:13.438]  You know there's a God seeing that.
[01:55:13.578 --> 01:55:14.078]  Yeah.
[01:55:14.078 --> 01:55:18.500]  You know, Kauai, I think the last time I was in Kauai was for Bruce Lee's funeral.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:18.920]  Wow.
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:19.600]  Yeah.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:20.260]  I was in Maui.
[01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:21.361]  Is he buried in there?
[01:55:21.361 --> 01:55:25.202]  Well, they had a memorial service in Kauai.
[01:55:25.202 --> 01:55:26.842]  That's interesting.
[01:55:26.842 --> 01:55:28.063]  That just popped back into my head.
[01:55:28.063 --> 01:55:29.323]  I tell you, I could live anywhere and be there.
[01:55:29.323 --> 01:55:29.843]  Yeah?
[01:55:29.843 --> 01:55:30.844]  I don't know.
[01:55:30.844 --> 01:55:32.504]  I think I'm going to get a little island fever.
[01:55:32.504 --> 01:55:32.984]  Yeah.
[01:55:32.984 --> 01:55:34.505]  You can always, for five hours, you're back.
[01:55:34.505 --> 01:55:34.685]  Yeah.
[01:55:35.365 --> 01:55:36.106]  I don't know, man.
[01:55:36.106 --> 01:55:38.268]  I feel shows, it was relaxed and zenned out.
[01:55:38.268 --> 01:55:39.550]  I'm always like this.
[01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:40.751]  Go to Hawaii, I'm like, whoa.
[01:55:40.751 --> 01:55:42.694]  Something happens, I just get really relaxed.
[01:55:42.694 --> 01:55:44.616]  Well, you know what that is.
[01:55:44.616 --> 01:55:46.238]  The jet lag, you're tired.
[01:55:46.238 --> 01:55:47.439]  Oh, the beer or something?
[01:55:50.013 --> 01:55:51.934]  Here's something else, man.
[01:55:51.934 --> 01:55:54.095]  Alright, Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[01:55:54.095 --> 01:56:02.458]  You've got to get back on the road back to North Texas, up there where you've got your compound, but I want you to pop in and do an interview for The War Room coming up.
[01:56:02.458 --> 01:56:03.839]  Absolutely.
[01:56:03.839 --> 01:56:06.620]  You know what, I just want to thank you, Alex.
[01:56:09.401 --> 01:56:13.784]  I'm not sure if people really understand what you're doing.
[01:56:13.784 --> 01:56:19.247]  Everything that goes on here and all these vitamins are the best of the best.
[01:56:19.247 --> 01:56:20.608]  I kid you not.
[01:56:20.608 --> 01:56:23.870]  Doctors are prescribing this stuff but you can get them right here.
[01:56:23.870 --> 01:56:25.031]  Please get them here.
[01:56:25.811 --> 01:56:33.177]  Because that's, a lot of what we do is they have these clinics where they sell them for 300, 400 bucks, with like a 7, 10 times markup through the doctors, and it's helping people.
[01:56:33.177 --> 01:56:41.324]  You guys can make claims about stuff now, a lot of it's been scientifically proven, but then you can like sell it for 50 bucks instead, and it's even better than what doctors are selling.
[01:56:41.324 --> 01:56:50.431]  I mean, I just went over, Blake, I just went over, I got some probiotics, some red, I mean, this is stuff that is cheaper than you're going to get at the doctors.
[01:56:50.431 --> 01:56:52.593]  Please get it, please support InfoWars.
[01:56:52.773 --> 01:57:14.866]  Well what you're saying is more and more even medical doctors offices and stuff they got a whole vitamin mineral compound section of really stuff that helps you it's just that for some reason you'll pay for a hundred bucks for fish oil at the doctor's office we're about to come up with the highest quality fish oil with us it's 30 bucks and it's you know big fusion of the very best been all cleaned out and everything so thank you so much you know it takes a lot of money to fund this operation but the listeners have come through and
[01:57:15.666 --> 01:57:17.027]  Again, it's not that we're even that good.
[01:57:17.027 --> 01:57:19.129]  It's that no one's really been challenging him.
[01:57:19.129 --> 01:57:20.890]  So it shows you how weak the globalists are.
[01:57:20.890 --> 01:57:25.654]  They're having all these hearings and saying, shut us down, and admitting that we're really hurting them.
[01:57:25.654 --> 01:57:32.360]  And so Project Veritas, James O'Keefe is coming up to discuss his latest inside video that we're going to be showing you here.
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:36.483]  And now they've been trying to censor his video itself of what they're up to.
[01:57:36.483 --> 01:57:38.264]  So thank you so much, Mike Norris.
[01:57:38.264 --> 01:57:41.927]  The new film, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, available at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:57:41.927 --> 01:57:42.428]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:42.428 --> 01:57:42.988]  Thank you, brother.
[01:57:42.988 --> 01:57:43.869]  Great job on the new film.
[01:57:45.987 --> 01:58:05.958]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:58:05.958 --> 01:58:08.079]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[01:58:47.143 --> 01:58:54.626]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:58:54.626 --> 01:59:07.830]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:59:50.548 --> 01:59:53.170]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:56.437 --> 02:00:08.904]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:08.904 --> 02:00:20.571]  Alright, coming up!
[02:00:21.789 --> 02:00:29.452]  We've got Sheriff Joe Arpaio, this is a big interview, who is running for the Senate and in a dead heat with the establishment candidate.
[02:00:29.452 --> 02:00:30.553]  He's going to be joining us.
[02:00:30.553 --> 02:00:37.816]  But first, in the next 30 minutes, we've got the head of Project Veritas, who has released one of the most devastating videos yet.
[02:00:38.756 --> 02:00:46.004]  Months long, months and months long inside investigation of Twitter censoring conservatives and libertarians and more.
[02:00:46.004 --> 02:00:51.450]  And now Twitter is caught silencing James O'Keefe amid censorship expose.
[02:00:51.450 --> 02:00:54.834]  That story is from Kit Daniels on Infowars.com.
[02:00:54.834 --> 02:00:57.937]  But first, Russia fraud is now imploding.
[02:00:57.937 --> 02:00:59.299]  A key John Bowne report.
[02:01:00.063 --> 02:01:09.130]  While the agents of fraud and slander attempt to take down the president's character... We're not at a 25th amendment level yet.
[02:01:09.130 --> 02:01:10.391]  Or they would... It's alarming.
[02:01:11.949 --> 02:01:14.891]  This is alarming in every way.
[02:01:14.891 --> 02:01:16.872]  And then this went on.
[02:01:16.872 --> 02:01:19.234]  Okay, this is a little 25th Amendment.
[02:01:19.234 --> 02:01:25.358]  So 25th Amendment is a concept that is alive every day in the White House.
[02:01:25.358 --> 02:01:29.961]  The President has this intensely loyal base, but is still unpopular with most Americans.
[02:01:29.961 --> 02:01:38.806]  No, it's been a concern for the White House for a while now that the President is surrounded by people who don't necessarily respect or like him very much.
[02:01:38.806 --> 02:01:41.128]  And the President, I think, is aware of that and it bothers him.
[02:01:41.328 --> 02:01:50.072]  TD Bank has finally handed over the documents regarding Fusion GPS's Steele dossier investigation they were so desperately clutching to.
[02:01:50.072 --> 02:01:55.494]  The House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the over 70 documents under a confidential settlement.
[02:01:55.494 --> 02:02:01.217]  Fusion GPS is appealing, claiming their employees' identities have been compromised.
[02:02:01.377 --> 02:02:14.685]  The Hill reports Fusion GPS officials have hit back at House Republicans saying they do not believe the dossier led to the federal probe into the alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russian election meddling.
[02:02:14.685 --> 02:02:28.253]  For more than five months now, we've had 20 members of the House Judiciary Committee calling for a second special counsel to evaluate the nexus between the DNC, the Clinton Foundation, Fusion GPS, and Russians.
[02:02:28.533 --> 02:02:31.114]  People really believe that the FBI did not know who paid for that dossier
[02:02:53.698 --> 02:02:55.539]  I've got a bridge to sell you.
[02:02:55.539 --> 02:03:00.903]  Why are they all coming out suddenly saying, okay, it's a total fraud, it's authoritarian, it's all a lie?
[02:03:00.903 --> 02:03:04.125]  Because they got caught and it blew up in their face.
[02:03:04.125 --> 02:03:12.270]  There's like 26, 27, depending on how you look at it, Justice Department and FBI officials who were all running the Russiagate thing.
[02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:20.415]  And then they like basically all, except for a couple, gave money to their wives and husbands of government money in the millions to put out the PPGay dossier.
[02:03:20.615 --> 02:03:30.500]  The real crime is the millions of taxpayer dollars from the FBI and Justice Department to the wives and husbands of people at Fusion GPS that made it up.
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:42.506]  Making the entire matter worse, we learned that the FBI paid Steele an additional $50,000 to update the phony dossier.
[02:03:42.506 --> 02:03:45.548]  The Democrats want to talk about collusion?
[02:03:45.548 --> 02:03:47.749]  They want to talk about dirty tricks?
[02:03:47.749 --> 02:03:50.010]  This is the dirtiest trick I've ever seen.
[02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:55.515]  Also, a senior fellow working for John McCain's institute is feeling the heat.
[02:03:55.515 --> 02:04:07.385]  Byron York, who flew to London in November of 2016 to retrieve the dossier, which, unbeknownst to McCain, had been floating around D.C., is now under subpoena for not being forthright.
[02:04:07.385 --> 02:04:17.474]  The Washington Examiner reports, in the session, Kramer told House investigators that he knew the identities of the Russian sources for the allegations in the Steele dossier.
[02:04:17.594 --> 02:04:22.877]  But when investigators pressed Kramer to reveal those names, he declined to do so.
[02:04:22.877 --> 02:04:24.597]  Now he is under subpoena.
[02:04:24.597 --> 02:04:30.400]  The subpoena directs Kramer to appear again before the house investigators on January 11th.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:39.864]  This should make for some real fireworks as Fusion GPS reveals the inner workings of a multi-million dollar political witch hunt that has backfired.
[02:04:39.864 --> 02:04:42.606]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:04:55.174 --> 02:04:58.577]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.

[02:05:08.425 --> 02:05:12.789]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:15.492]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:05:15.492 --> 02:05:22.522]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:22.522 --> 02:05:29.711]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:30.692 --> 02:05:35.753]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:35.753 --> 02:05:43.395]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:05:43.395 --> 02:05:48.316]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.

[02:06:01.249 --> 02:06:09.654]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:06:24.173 --> 02:06:34.403]  The authoritarians that are controlling this planet to a great extent, the technocrats, the big tech giants, they admit they're setting up something called a technocracy.
[02:06:34.403 --> 02:06:38.267]  And the definition of technocracy is an authoritarian world government
[02:06:40.037 --> 02:06:46.667]  That uses technology and the tracking of information to control what the general population does.
[02:06:46.667 --> 02:06:48.330]  Pull up your own definition.
[02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:49.672]  But it is an authoritarian system.
[02:06:49.672 --> 02:06:55.000]  If you read about Davos and the EU and the Goldman Sachs, they all say, we are technocrats.
[02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:57.849]  We are technocrats.
[02:06:57.849 --> 02:07:07.035]  Now I'd read that in their documents 20 years ago and talk about it, but you go read what they're saying publicly now, that's what they've shut up, that's what they've established.
[02:07:07.035 --> 02:07:17.501]  And James O'Keefe from Project Veritas has been at the heart of exposing it, and as you can see, you're watching on television right now, he will be entering the studio here momentarily, kind of like
[02:07:18.647 --> 02:07:19.348]  I am sometimes.
[02:07:19.348 --> 02:07:23.793]  He's busy with some big breaking news, but he's about to be there here in just a moment.
[02:07:23.793 --> 02:07:32.522]  I sure understand having so many things in the air, so many pans on the stove that we're juggling here.
[02:07:32.522 --> 02:07:34.364]  So he's going to be joining us here in just a moment.
[02:07:35.523 --> 02:07:40.927]  But he didn't just catch him on tape a few months ago saying our main mission is to censor Alex Jones and the Liberty Movement.
[02:07:40.927 --> 02:07:42.668]  That was Google and YouTube.
[02:07:42.668 --> 02:07:49.813]  He's now, you know, got the Democrats saying we steal elections, we bus in illegals to vote, we have them vote the names of dead people.
[02:07:49.813 --> 02:07:53.976]  He didn't just expose all the other countless things like ACORN and bring that down.
[02:07:55.558 --> 02:07:58.680]  If there was more investigative journalists, we would have already won this thing.
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:00.262]  But we're starting to win!
[02:08:00.262 --> 02:08:01.583]  But we're just starting to win.
[02:08:01.583 --> 02:08:02.924]  We're starting to turn the tide.
[02:08:02.924 --> 02:08:20.579]  But now he's got undercover video that is incredible, that's on ProjectVeritas.com, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PopStoryOnDrugsReport.com, at least the last time I looked this afternoon, undercover Twitter engineers to ban way of
[02:08:21.343 --> 02:08:27.625]  Talking through shadow banning algorithms to censor opposing political views and Drudge has the headline that
[02:08:28.717 --> 02:08:32.198]  They admit they are opposing people's views, period.
[02:08:32.198 --> 02:08:36.178]  Just not letting you communicate if you're a Christian, a conservative, a libertarian.
[02:08:36.178 --> 02:08:51.481]  If you say a terror attack is Islamic, when ISIS has taken responsibility, they'll have a congressional hearing the day it happens, and have Google, Facebook, and Twitter there, and they go, Paul Watson at Infowars is number one on Twitter, and he says that it's an Islamic attack and they've been warned.
[02:08:51.481 --> 02:08:53.742]  And they go, sir, we banned it during lunch.
[02:08:53.742 --> 02:08:53.942]  I mean,
[02:08:54.702 --> 02:08:58.083]  So a lot of this is out in the open now, but this is incredible.
[02:08:58.083 --> 02:09:15.690]  At their meetings, at restaurants, we're going to find out how long this investigation went, but this is one of the most damning, because they brag about, yeah, we spy on the President, and we're ready to give to the Justice Department, implying they've got something in his private, private Twitter stuff, where people are contacting him.
[02:09:15.690 --> 02:09:20.832]  That's like tapping the President's phone, and they say, we're ready to give it to Congress, implying there's something.
[02:09:20.832 --> 02:09:21.413]  This is how
[02:09:22.393 --> 02:09:23.234]  Incredible it is.
[02:09:23.234 --> 02:09:29.260]  We should put this back on screen, the Deep State symbol, because you think of Deep State as government, but it's the tech giants.
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:30.861]  It's Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:09:30.861 --> 02:09:35.105]  They're the ones that nobody has got a leg up on.
[02:09:35.105 --> 02:09:44.114]  I mean, they're the King Daddies, and they're the fake liberals, and they're manned by all these SJWs right out of university who are proud of their censorship.
[02:09:44.114 --> 02:09:44.954]  So James O'Keefe,
[02:09:45.655 --> 02:09:47.015]  You have done it again, my friend.
[02:09:47.015 --> 02:09:48.216]  Congratulations.
[02:09:48.216 --> 02:09:50.216]  They're at Project Veritas.
[02:09:50.216 --> 02:09:59.019]  Lay out the etymology of this and the footage, because if we play it, we'll run out of time having you here as this amazing infiltration.
[02:09:59.019 --> 02:10:03.460]  Well, Alex, I mean, this is one of the greatest censorship stories in modern times.
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:08.762]  I mean, the things these people are saying on this video, I think this is certainly the biggest thing we have ever done.
[02:10:09.555 --> 02:10:11.397]  Uh, these are the most powerful people in the world.
[02:10:11.397 --> 02:10:13.960]  There you have it on the screen in front of you.
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:15.542]  Our strategy is to shadow ban.
[02:10:15.542 --> 02:10:23.271]  Now your viewers might know what this is, but really what they're saying is that when you tweet or Facebook something, you think it's going to your users.
[02:10:23.271 --> 02:10:26.475]  What these companies are doing and these engineers are on video describing,
[02:10:27.775 --> 02:10:33.718]  You think that your information is going to your users, but the people on the timeline don't see the information.
[02:10:33.718 --> 02:10:34.719]  That's what a shadow ban is.
[02:10:34.719 --> 02:10:48.585]  And they talk about how they specifically targeted, and this is their words, not mine, rednecks, conservatives who tweet about the flag, and they create algorithms where if you mention these things that correlate with certain ideas, they ban you.
[02:10:48.585 --> 02:10:51.666]  And they call it S-H-I-T-T-Y people.
[02:10:51.666 --> 02:10:54.848]  This is what the policy executives, these are not low-level employees,
[02:10:55.348 --> 02:10:57.090]  These are executives at Twitter.
[02:10:57.090 --> 02:11:02.735]  Stephen Pierre, a Twitter engineer, says we want to, quote, ban a way of talking.
[02:11:02.735 --> 02:11:06.459]  I hope you play some of these clips for your audience, because this is truly extraordinary.
[02:11:06.459 --> 02:11:11.924]  They say they want to downrank, uh, uh, S-H-I-T-T-Y people.
[02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:13.606]  Uh, to not show up.
[02:11:13.606 --> 02:11:15.227]  We're working on that right now.
[02:11:15.227 --> 02:11:17.770]  So they're describing the products and the pro.
[02:11:17.770 --> 02:11:28.343]  There's a Singh who's on the direct messaging team talking about how they use algorithms to target Julian Assange to target conservatives and to ban a way of talking.
[02:11:30.134 --> 02:11:34.218]  We're going to play some of the video once you've left, but just in the time we have, people... Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[02:11:34.218 --> 02:11:49.811]  People need to go to Project Veritas and see it for themselves in InfoWars, but it just shows a total culture of censorship and dehumanizing white people is rednecks, but then Julian Assange that's, you know, bipartisan exposing things, a real hero, you know, they're calling him bad things as well.
[02:11:49.811 --> 02:11:52.213]  I mean, these are horrible people.
[02:11:52.213 --> 02:11:55.636]  But again, they're getting directives from on high that this is to be done.
[02:11:56.482 --> 02:11:57.903]  Yes, they're getting directives.
[02:11:57.903 --> 02:11:58.823]  It's part of the culture.
[02:11:58.823 --> 02:12:02.966]  One of the executives in the tape, Alex, says that there's an unwritten policy.
[02:12:02.966 --> 02:12:03.526]  There you have it, Mo.
[02:12:03.526 --> 02:12:08.789]  He says there's an unwritten policy to do this, even though it's not part of the language.
[02:12:08.789 --> 02:12:11.851]  He's just, you know, taking certain tweets down.
[02:12:11.851 --> 02:12:14.333]  Alex, Twitter bills itself as the public square.
[02:12:14.913 --> 02:12:22.117]  And what your audience needs to understand is if they take away our rights to share our ideas on these platforms, where are we going to go?
[02:12:22.117 --> 02:12:24.399]  I mean, most people don't have the power to create their own website.
[02:12:24.399 --> 02:12:34.945]  I know these are private companies, and we may not want the government to intervene, but unless the CEO of Twitter makes their algorithms public so the users know what they're doing, the government may not have a choice but to intervene.
[02:12:34.945 --> 02:12:37.066]  I mean, this is scary stuff!
[02:12:37.586 --> 02:12:46.290]  And don't take my word for it, they're on tape saying their whole MO is to quote, ban a way of talking.
[02:12:46.290 --> 02:12:51.032]  This is the greatest censorship story of modern times.
[02:12:51.032 --> 02:12:54.954]  And unlike the mainstream media Alex, we don't just anonymously quote sources.
[02:12:54.954 --> 02:12:56.435]  We have these people dead to rights.
[02:12:56.435 --> 02:12:57.395]  How do we do it?
[02:12:57.395 --> 02:12:58.516]  We spend a year
[02:12:59.236 --> 02:13:03.958]  A year undercover building and drawing these people out, building their trust.
[02:13:03.958 --> 02:13:10.141]  A lot of these people are not even American citizens because they outsource a lot of this engineering to other countries.
[02:13:10.141 --> 02:13:11.621]  They bring people in on student visas.
[02:13:11.621 --> 02:13:15.323]  In this video you'll see a lot of foreign workers describing how they target
[02:13:16.211 --> 02:13:19.452]  American patriots, just because they don't like what they have to say.
[02:13:19.452 --> 02:13:22.913]  And we're not talking about white supremacists or Nazi people.
[02:13:22.913 --> 02:13:26.094]  They're just targeting moderate, conservative people.
[02:13:26.094 --> 02:13:35.278]  But James, that's what globalism is, is ganging up on nation states, taking it over, letting China have lower taxes than we have, designed to de-industrialize us.
[02:13:35.278 --> 02:13:36.178]  It's Cloward and Piven.
[02:13:37.239 --> 02:13:40.801]  And here they are saying, we're going after all the opposition.
[02:13:40.801 --> 02:13:47.464]  Now we've got a story on Infowars.com, I don't know if you know about this, but Twitter has been caught now censoring your exposure.
[02:13:47.464 --> 02:13:47.924]  How is that?
[02:13:47.924 --> 02:13:48.845]  I didn't see that one.
[02:13:48.845 --> 02:13:49.985]  Are they muting me?
[02:13:49.985 --> 02:13:51.886]  Are they shadowbanning my stuff now?
[02:13:51.886 --> 02:13:56.088]  Yes, with O'Keefe's suspension, Twitter confirms authenticity in Project Veritas videos.
[02:13:56.088 --> 02:14:05.493]  Twitter unblocked James O'Keefe's account after suffering massive backlash for silencing the Project Veritas founder as his exposé on Twitter, political censorship, went viral.
[02:14:06.053 --> 02:14:10.296]  You know what's amazing, Alex, is that we're using Twitter's platform to get the information out.
[02:14:10.296 --> 02:14:11.437]  They are really in a pickle.
[02:14:11.437 --> 02:14:13.378]  They're in a bind because they can't ban me.
[02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:15.120]  They reinstated my account there.
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:18.382]  A lot of people on... This is trending on Twitter, Alex, believe it or not.
[02:14:18.382 --> 02:14:19.583]  Isn't that ironic?
[02:14:19.583 --> 02:14:25.607]  Shadowban... Hashtag Shadowban is trending on Twitter from my... looking at my phone here.
[02:14:25.607 --> 02:14:27.949]  And everyone is tweeting at the CEO of Twitter.
[02:14:27.949 --> 02:14:29.030]  This is big stuff!
[02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:31.712]  By the way, Alex, yesterday Twitter issued a statement.
[02:14:31.712 --> 02:14:34.794]  The statement was, quote, the individual depicted in the video
[02:14:35.274 --> 02:14:39.075]  We're speaking in a personal capacity and does not represent Twitter.
[02:14:39.075 --> 02:14:46.298]  So they're saying this is a rogue employee and today we have eight eight rogue employees including on the policy team.
[02:14:46.298 --> 02:14:49.539]  We have engineers on the direct messaging team.
[02:14:49.539 --> 02:14:51.180]  We have engineers describing things they're doing.
[02:14:52.214 --> 02:14:53.536]  Uh, this is, this is historic.
[02:14:53.536 --> 02:14:54.877]  And this is what YouTube does.
[02:14:54.877 --> 02:15:02.466]  They also put you into a phantom zone where you think you're hitting your subscribers, but only people going to Project Veritas or Real Alex Jones.
[02:15:02.466 --> 02:15:07.291]  You have to go there looking for it yourself to share it, and you caught YouTube executives.
[02:15:08.052 --> 02:15:09.534]  Saying the exact same thing about us.
[02:15:09.534 --> 02:15:10.795]  So, this is incredible.
[02:15:10.795 --> 02:15:12.216]  So first they ban you.
[02:15:12.216 --> 02:15:14.658]  Then it blows up in their face because you're covering this.
[02:15:14.658 --> 02:15:17.201]  Now they have to unban you.
[02:15:17.201 --> 02:15:19.263]  And then you make the point, well, you know, it's their company.
[02:15:19.263 --> 02:15:21.025]  But they hold out it's the public square.
[02:15:21.025 --> 02:15:22.526]  It's false advertising.
[02:15:22.526 --> 02:15:23.367]  And it's all secret.
[02:15:23.367 --> 02:15:24.288]  Then they discriminate.
[02:15:24.288 --> 02:15:29.473]  I mean, if you can't, you know, say no to baking a gay couple's cake, you sure can't keep conservatives off Twitter.
[02:15:29.997 --> 02:15:34.158]  Well, they're also giving direct messages, according to them, to the government.
[02:15:34.158 --> 02:15:44.622]  And in yesterday's video, they say, well, we go into your DMs, and one of the things that they're saying, Alex, and this is really graphic, but this is some of the stuff that's gonna come out, they're talking about private genital photos.
[02:15:44.622 --> 02:15:45.462]  Now, I don't, I don't...
[02:15:45.982 --> 02:15:47.124]  Put that stuff on there.
[02:15:47.124 --> 02:15:54.012]  Maybe there's an American... Sure, but like the NSA or worse, they're going through all your private messages, trolling it, enjoying themselves, like a bunch of peeping toms.
[02:15:54.012 --> 02:15:54.332]  Stay there.
[02:16:04.344 --> 02:16:07.427]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[02:16:07.427 --> 02:16:08.989]  NASA PAC Technology.
[02:16:08.989 --> 02:16:09.609]  Bacon.
[02:16:09.609 --> 02:16:13.774]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon.
[02:16:13.774 --> 02:16:15.195]  Or warm and serve.
[02:16:15.195 --> 02:16:17.257]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon.
[02:16:17.257 --> 02:16:19.199]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[02:16:19.199 --> 02:16:21.982]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.
[02:16:21.982 --> 02:16:23.283]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[02:16:24.451 --> 02:16:25.271]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:16:25.271 --> 02:16:27.052]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:16:27.052 --> 02:16:28.713]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:31.535]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:16:31.535 --> 02:16:33.816]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:16:33.816 --> 02:16:38.339]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:16:38.339 --> 02:16:42.281]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:16:42.281 --> 02:16:46.043]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:16:46.043 --> 02:16:46.463]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:16:46.463 --> 02:16:48.104]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:16:53.971 --> 02:16:55.912]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:55.912 --> 02:17:01.234]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.

[02:18:07.157 --> 02:18:08.518]  So what do we do about it?

[02:19:58.147 --> 02:20:00.809]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:12.112 --> 02:20:14.635]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:20:14.635 --> 02:20:17.398]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:20:17.398 --> 02:20:19.720]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:24.907 --> 02:20:27.489]  James O'Keefe of Project Veritas is our guest.
[02:20:27.489 --> 02:20:30.831]  We're going to play some clips after he leaves us here in about four minutes.
[02:20:30.831 --> 02:20:40.037]  But James, as you said, I can sense this is historic because it just shows the censorship and it gets people excited about promoting the story and then they see it being censored.
[02:20:40.037 --> 02:20:42.239]  Hey, if this is what they're doing, then bring it out in the light.
[02:20:42.239 --> 02:20:48.983]  Give us more details of what's in the video, but also the shockwaves this is sending across the world right now.
[02:20:50.939 --> 02:20:52.280]  This is the biggest thing we've ever done.
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:53.960]  We've done some big ones.
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:57.282]  This thing is rocking Silicon Valley.
[02:20:57.282 --> 02:20:58.783]  My phone is blowing up.
[02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:02.044]  I'm not just saying this to hype it.
[02:21:02.044 --> 02:21:08.907]  Twitter corporate issued a second response here in the last hour saying we're not doing it when they're on video doing it.
[02:21:08.907 --> 02:21:10.648]  This might force their CEO to
[02:21:11.593 --> 02:21:14.837]  I mean, you guys gotta tweet at Jack Dorsey, at Jack Dorsey.
[02:21:14.837 --> 02:21:18.962]  This is the biggest censorship story in modern times.
[02:21:18.962 --> 02:21:21.465]  And unlike the mainstream media, we have them dead to rights.
[02:21:21.465 --> 02:21:22.486]  They're caught on video.
[02:21:22.486 --> 02:21:25.069]  It's not me quoting people in a text article.
[02:21:25.069 --> 02:21:31.557]  They're on tape in restaurants, in areas where there's no expectation of privacy, talking about how they target people using their algorithms.
[02:21:32.057 --> 02:21:35.739]  And everything we do is on the line, because Twitter is the modern public square.
[02:21:35.739 --> 02:21:40.341]  Whether we like it or not, these companies are the modern public square.
[02:21:40.341 --> 02:21:45.324]  And they're describing how they censor moderate voices, not ultra right-wing ones.
[02:21:45.324 --> 02:21:46.604]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:21:46.604 --> 02:21:48.205]  I gotta say something that's happening right now.
[02:21:48.205 --> 02:21:50.286]  This is not a right-wing story.
[02:21:50.286 --> 02:21:56.649]  There's a lot of people, mainstream people, who are raising their eyebrows and patting us on the back.
[02:21:56.649 --> 02:22:00.151]  And the media is going to be dragged kicking and screaming into covering this one.
[02:22:01.492 --> 02:22:14.981]  I'm really proud of our team for what we've, you know, my undercover journalists put their lives on the line for this and they get attacked and I got the Attorney General of California sending me an audit letter which I'm going to publish soon.
[02:22:14.981 --> 02:22:26.389]  I mean, everything is on the line and this is the greatest censorship issue of our time and there's more to come!
[02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:27.290]  I've got more videos!
[02:22:28.188 --> 02:22:38.616]  We're witnessing organized, focused racketeering, in my view, in meetings, at events, in classrooms, but then out at bars, about how they're organized, how they're censoring.
[02:22:38.616 --> 02:22:41.658]  We're going to play some of the clips after you leave here in a minute or two.
[02:22:41.658 --> 02:22:45.121]  And again, the fact that they try to deny it, they know it's damning.
[02:22:45.121 --> 02:22:46.562]  It's going to completely blow up in their face.
[02:22:46.562 --> 02:22:50.726]  And then you add the Google censorship, the YouTube admitting it to everybody.
[02:22:50.726 --> 02:22:56.390]  The stuff that you got about me is now being used in current lawsuits from Google executives that have gone public.
[02:22:56.670 --> 02:22:58.871]  It looks like the whole house of cards is starting to go down.
[02:22:58.871 --> 02:23:03.453]  If you track the line of what's giving us the key intel, it's Project Veritas, my friend.
[02:23:03.453 --> 02:23:06.174]  Yeah, James Damore sued Google this week.
[02:23:06.174 --> 02:23:07.815]  I've been in touch with him.
[02:23:07.815 --> 02:23:10.456]  Charles Johnson sued Twitter this week.
[02:23:10.456 --> 02:23:11.856]  Dennis Prager sued YouTube.
[02:23:13.553 --> 02:23:17.514]  Well, everything you guys have been saying is in this video.
[02:23:17.514 --> 02:23:21.036]  I mean, I can't even... I kind of have to let the video speak for itself, you know?
[02:23:21.036 --> 02:23:31.319]  I mean, all I can say is the one request I have for your audience right now is go to Twitter, if you have a Twitter account, and tweet at Jack Dorsey, at J-A-C-K, and say, hey Jack,
[02:23:31.949 --> 02:23:33.570]  You know, you better answer for this.
[02:23:33.570 --> 02:23:35.171]  Make your algorithms public.
[02:23:35.171 --> 02:23:36.712]  It's a user-driven system.
[02:23:36.712 --> 02:23:41.295]  We don't want government intervention, but you've got to make it public because anonymity breeds responsibility.
[02:23:41.295 --> 02:23:46.958]  And Alex, I'd like to come back on your show because the next video we release, I mean, I can't even make this stuff up.
[02:23:46.958 --> 02:23:50.000]  James, you've got the hotline and any time you call us, you're on.
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:51.261]  Please give us an update tomorrow.
[02:23:51.261 --> 02:23:51.841]  You are on top.
[02:23:51.841 --> 02:23:54.363]  The biggest story probably in the world right now.
[02:23:54.363 --> 02:23:54.943]  Incredible.
[02:23:54.943 --> 02:23:55.584]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:56.184 --> 02:23:56.904]  I'll be back.
[02:23:56.904 --> 02:23:57.285]  See ya.
[02:23:57.285 --> 02:23:57.845]  Thank you.
[02:23:57.845 --> 02:23:59.186]  Now he's gotta go.
[02:23:59.186 --> 02:24:00.546]  Folks, let me tell you.
[02:24:00.546 --> 02:24:02.047]  I don't just send donations around.
[02:24:02.047 --> 02:24:11.272]  I sent 20 grand there a few months ago because the video they got at Google saying that I'm the number one enemy and they're censoring me, when it got to the lawyers they said, this is it.
[02:24:11.272 --> 02:24:13.173]  No matter how good their lawyers are, you win.
[02:24:13.173 --> 02:24:14.113]  And we're getting ready.
[02:24:14.113 --> 02:24:16.714]  And it's being used in the other lawsuit, the DeMore suit.
[02:24:16.714 --> 02:24:17.835]  And they got more documents.
[02:24:17.835 --> 02:24:20.276]  And I don't want to just sue for me.
[02:24:20.276 --> 02:24:21.037]  These pigs
[02:24:22.117 --> 02:24:26.340]  Are blocking everything we do, and then not even letting us... Oh, we send out to our millions of subscribers?
[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:27.581]  Nobody gets it.
[02:24:27.581 --> 02:24:31.184]  We do all this, they demonetize us 95%.
[02:24:31.184 --> 02:24:32.585]  Don't even tell us.
[02:24:32.585 --> 02:24:43.332]  And then they got these arrogant people, they get up on their high horse video, and they just arrogantly shoot... Rednecks like Julian Assange!
[02:24:43.332 --> 02:24:45.354]  Yeah, we're shutting him down.
[02:24:45.354 --> 02:24:47.175]  The guy that George W. Bush wanted arrested.
[02:24:48.979 --> 02:24:49.959]  It's sick.
[02:24:49.959 --> 02:24:54.721]  But again, they're liberals, so it's okay to be fascist.
[02:24:54.721 --> 02:24:57.262]  And you see how Antifa doesn't want you to be able to march?
[02:24:57.262 --> 02:25:01.603]  And they tell our reporters with guns in Austin, you can't go through here to the Capitol.
[02:25:01.603 --> 02:25:02.383]  We have guns.
[02:25:02.383 --> 02:25:03.044]  Are you scared?
[02:25:03.044 --> 02:25:05.924]  No one's like, yeah, you're hitting me with clubs and you have guns.
[02:25:05.924 --> 02:25:08.505]  If your finger's on the trigger, I am actually shaking.
[02:25:08.505 --> 02:25:10.086]  The police just say we've been ordered to stand down.
[02:25:10.086 --> 02:25:11.426]  Sorry, Owen.
[02:25:11.426 --> 02:25:16.688]  Well, these are the same people running these platforms, and they want to censor everything.
[02:25:18.083 --> 02:25:19.704]  And they are the internet.
[02:25:19.704 --> 02:25:25.366]  They get everybody to go on their platform, say they're free and open, and then secretly start censoring.
[02:25:25.366 --> 02:25:31.308]  So, I'm not bragging when I tell you we've given $100,000 for this big investigation into pedophilia that's been there on the arrest.
[02:25:31.308 --> 02:25:33.989]  All of it's going to be here soon.
[02:25:33.989 --> 02:25:34.629]  We've been supplied.
[02:25:35.715 --> 02:25:38.137]  I'm leaving it at that, and we're helping Veritas behind the scenes.
[02:25:38.137 --> 02:25:40.719]  That's why you need to go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:25:40.719 --> 02:25:41.540]  You need to commit.
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:45.082]  I don't want to sit here with the information time we have and plug this, plug that.
[02:25:45.082 --> 02:25:53.389]  We got the best supplements, the best game-changing products, the best t-shirts, the best films, the best books, just material to fight the globalists, and I've been so busy.
[02:25:55.356 --> 02:25:58.597]  Half the stuff we got at 50% off isn't 50% off because it's sold out.
[02:25:58.597 --> 02:26:00.438]  But we got Sigma-12, sold 50%.
[02:26:00.438 --> 02:26:02.979]  Survival Shield X2, you gotta get that, 50%.
[02:26:02.979 --> 02:26:03.999]  Super Metal, 50%.
[02:26:03.999 --> 02:26:04.740]  A bunch of other stuff.
[02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:06.280]  The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:07.541]  The new Mike Norris film.
[02:26:07.541 --> 02:26:10.922]  This is what a second American Revolution Civil War would look like.
[02:26:10.922 --> 02:26:12.643]  Very important.
[02:26:12.643 --> 02:26:14.603]  InfoWars, endorsed by his father Chuck Norris.
[02:26:14.603 --> 02:26:15.584]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:26:18.595 --> 02:26:24.522]  By the way, Chuck is a daily listener, and he's been on before, but a little birdie told me we're going to have Chuck very soon in person here.
[02:26:24.522 --> 02:26:25.483]  So that's always great.
[02:26:25.483 --> 02:26:26.604]  He's a really smart guy.
[02:26:26.604 --> 02:26:28.186]  But right now, let's play a few minutes.
[02:26:29.378 --> 02:26:34.043]  Of O'Keefe, who is just on fire.
[02:26:34.043 --> 02:26:38.949]  Because again, it's the arrogance and how they're talking about, they're calling us pieces of crap.
[02:26:38.949 --> 02:26:45.356]  And we know that if we put out a clip of Hillary saying black people are subhuman, they block it.
[02:26:45.356 --> 02:26:49.401]  Because they don't want you to see Hillary saying blacks are super predators and aren't good people.
[02:26:50.765 --> 02:26:52.207]  And deserve longer prison sentences.
[02:26:52.207 --> 02:26:53.128]  That's the stuff.
[02:26:53.128 --> 02:26:54.550]  And it's in the WikiLeaks they censor.
[02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:55.571]  They all do it.
[02:26:55.571 --> 02:26:57.273]  Then they deny they do it.
[02:26:57.273 --> 02:27:00.216]  Well, you're going to get antitrust suits and discrimination suits.
[02:27:00.216 --> 02:27:01.578]  And you are getting sued.
[02:27:01.578 --> 02:27:03.921]  And I told you I was going to sue you.
[02:27:03.921 --> 02:27:04.682]  But I was told.
[02:27:04.682 --> 02:27:07.144]  Alex, sound on once the class action goes.
[02:27:07.725 --> 02:27:10.268]  Now you see all the lawsuits with my name in them.
[02:27:10.268 --> 02:27:11.910]  Every one of the damn things, excuse me.
[02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:14.593]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip from the Project Veritas Expose.
[02:27:14.593 --> 02:27:16.015]  It's on Infowars.com right now.
[02:27:16.015 --> 02:27:21.001]  Get our articles about it and tweet it at the head of Twitter from real Alex Jones right now.
[02:27:21.001 --> 02:27:21.402]  Here's a clip.
[02:27:26.042 --> 02:27:29.344]  Let's say it was a pro-Trump thing, and I am anti-Trump.
[02:27:29.344 --> 02:27:32.527]  I was like, oh, I just, I abandoned the self-count.
[02:27:32.527 --> 02:27:33.928]  It'll go to you.
[02:27:33.928 --> 02:27:35.529]  And then it's at your discretion.
[02:27:35.529 --> 02:27:37.810]  And if you're anti-Trump, you're like, oh, you know what?
[02:27:37.810 --> 02:27:38.491]  I'm almost right.
[02:27:38.491 --> 02:27:38.631]  F*** it.
[02:27:38.631 --> 02:27:39.452]  Let it go.
[02:27:39.452 --> 02:27:41.053]  The idea of the shadow ban is that
[02:27:42.185 --> 02:27:48.273]  You ban someone but they don't know they've been banned because they keep posting but no one sees their content.
[02:27:48.273 --> 02:27:53.080]  So they just think that no one's engaging with their content when in reality no one's seeing it.
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:54.922]  I don't know if Twitter does this anymore.
[02:27:54.922 --> 02:27:56.985]  How do you know if it's a lie or not?
[02:27:57.445 --> 02:27:59.506]  Oh, you use machine learning.
[02:27:59.506 --> 02:28:05.909]  I look for Trump or America or any of like 5,000 like keywords to describe a redneck.
[02:28:05.909 --> 02:28:13.532]  And then you look, and you like parse all the messages, all like the pictures, and then you look for like stuff that matches like that stuff.
[02:28:13.532 --> 02:28:20.214]  So is it going to like, essentially bamf certain mindsets and or people who could be negative?
[02:28:20.214 --> 02:28:20.614]  Yeah.
[02:28:20.614 --> 02:28:20.875]  No.
[02:28:20.875 --> 02:28:22.595]  No, they allow the Twitter people.
[02:28:24.884 --> 02:28:28.887]  Like, Oberman to run and say he's gonna kill everybody and murder everybody, he stays up.
[02:28:28.887 --> 02:28:31.429]  And they call, oh, don't be negative.
[02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:42.479]  Don't say that, oh, look, the lowest black unemployment, we tweeted this week, the lowest black unemployment level ever to millions of people on our platforms and got a couple hundred responses.
[02:28:42.479 --> 02:28:46.362]  Cuz they were only seeing it at Real Alex Jones or at Prison Planet with Paul.
[02:28:46.362 --> 02:28:53.548]  And Paul's one of the biggest guys on Twitter, despite the fact you have to go to his Twitter page to even see the material.
[02:28:54.108 --> 02:28:59.092]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of MyPillow, and like all of you out there, I have problems sleeping.
[02:28:59.092 --> 02:29:06.739]  Pillows would go flat, I would flip-flop all night long, I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache, or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours.
[02:29:06.739 --> 02:29:14.786]  When I invented MyPillow, I wanted it to where you can move the pad and fill to give you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.
[02:29:15.006 --> 02:29:19.270]  MyPillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:23.753]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed, it's about how much of that quality sleep we get.

[02:31:10.427 --> 02:31:12.808]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[02:31:12.808 --> 02:31:14.569]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:31:14.569 --> 02:31:19.853]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[02:31:19.853 --> 02:31:21.454]  Up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.

[02:31:29.638 --> 02:31:30.799]  Optimal absorption.
[02:31:30.799 --> 02:31:35.922]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[02:31:35.922 --> 02:31:41.125]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.

[02:31:55.175 --> 02:32:00.339]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[02:32:00.339 --> 02:32:05.102]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:32:05.102 --> 02:32:13.788]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:32:13.788 --> 02:32:17.030]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[02:32:17.290 --> 02:32:22.535]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:32:22.535 --> 02:32:29.842]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[02:32:29.842 --> 02:32:33.746]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:32:33.746 --> 02:32:38.490]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:32:38.490 --> 02:32:42.554]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a
[02:32:43.014 --> 02:32:46.557]  50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.

[02:32:58.144 --> 02:33:00.746]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:08.189 --> 02:33:34.012]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.012 --> 02:33:34.913]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:33:35.905 --> 02:33:44.531]  He only executed the law faithfully as a federal officer with an astounding track record and exemplary awards in the DEA.
[02:33:44.531 --> 02:33:49.594]  Then he was one of the longest-serving, most successful sheriffs ever in Maricopa County, executing the law.
[02:33:49.594 --> 02:34:01.662]  Then George Soros put millions of dollars in to stop him, clear election fraud, removed him very narrowly, and now like a phoenix rising back, despite the fact that the globalists are giving 20 to 1 money to his competitor.
[02:34:01.662 --> 02:34:05.465]  He's now in a dead heat, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:06.735 --> 02:34:11.576]  Joe Arpaio in dead heat with, I'm not going to say their name, in GOP race for U.S.
[02:34:11.576 --> 02:34:13.337]  Senate in Arizona.
[02:34:13.337 --> 02:34:21.660]  Now, just like internal bots showed, and I told you that Trump was 15 points ahead, Hillary stole five states, tried to steal others.
[02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:23.780]  State Homeland Security has exposed it.
[02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:27.841]  We now know seven plus million people voted with the names of dead folks.
[02:34:27.841 --> 02:34:30.642]  Project Veritas exposed the Democrats admitting that.
[02:34:30.642 --> 02:34:32.143]  They're going to hit him with massive fraud.
[02:34:33.243 --> 02:34:34.064]  It doesn't matter.
[02:34:34.064 --> 02:34:42.693]  We have all got to get very aggressive to get Sheriff Opaio, who's already served a long, long career to defend this republic, in there.
[02:34:42.693 --> 02:34:43.414]  But we can do it.
[02:34:43.414 --> 02:34:45.115]  Just like we got the message to President Trump.
[02:34:45.115 --> 02:34:49.780]  He didn't even know that he was going to be put in prison by a federal judge for executing the law.
[02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:50.961]  So we can do it.
[02:34:50.961 --> 02:34:51.782]  And this is the time.
[02:34:51.782 --> 02:34:52.924]  But we are facing criminals.
[02:34:53.804 --> 02:34:56.567]  And so, he is the guy we must have.
[02:34:56.567 --> 02:34:58.329]  I'm not saying the other candidate's evil.
[02:34:58.329 --> 02:35:06.316]  I'm just saying he is the literal knight in shining armor, the committed person, and it's a message to the globalists as well.
[02:35:06.316 --> 02:35:09.899]  You destroy people that stand up for what's right, we will rebuild them the next day.
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:10.840]  Well, thank you.
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:11.781]  Thank you for your hard work, Alex.
[02:35:11.781 --> 02:35:12.441]  Glad we have you.
[02:35:12.441 --> 02:35:14.382]  You can't always listen to the other networks, which they call fake news.
[02:35:40.934 --> 02:35:42.115]  So, uh, thank you.
[02:35:42.115 --> 02:35:43.496]  Well, thank you.
[02:35:43.496 --> 02:35:46.598]  Yeah, they've been saying that I say there's a Mars base with kids on it.
[02:35:46.598 --> 02:35:48.259]  There's no video of me saying it.
[02:35:48.259 --> 02:35:56.665]  They just say I said that, just like they say you hate Mexicans, uh, when, uh, you know, you're married to, I mean, it's just that they're such liars.
[02:35:56.665 --> 02:36:08.753]  Well, yeah, but, uh, that's something they've been after me, uh, since I, uh, at least the last 15 years when I started the, uh, fight against illegal immigration and you know what happened the last, uh, election.
[02:36:09.522 --> 02:36:25.548]  The biggest fraud that he perpetrated against me emanating from the Holder and Obama district judges wouldn't even give me a jury trial so I can go on and on on a misdemeanor contempt of court.
[02:36:25.548 --> 02:36:28.689]  How can you beat a contempt of court by a judge?
[02:36:28.689 --> 02:36:33.051]  You think the other judges are going to rule against me or for me?
[02:36:33.051 --> 02:36:34.131]  No, they rule against me.
[02:36:34.502 --> 02:36:37.386]  Well, we've only got you for this segment and the next, and I want to get into the Senate race.
[02:36:37.386 --> 02:36:44.936]  I want listeners all over the country to donate, to get involved, to travel there, to get on the job, to show them you destroy one of our people, we will build them back up.
[02:36:44.936 --> 02:36:51.185]  This is so important to get you in the Senate, but expanding on that, since you raised that, we now know, can we put it behind me on screen for TV viewers?
[02:36:51.465 --> 02:36:53.787]  Because our folks built this working with other folks.
[02:36:53.787 --> 02:36:54.828]  We have the list.
[02:36:54.828 --> 02:36:55.909]  In fact, I lost my list.
[02:36:55.909 --> 02:36:56.830]  Will you guys bring it back in?
[02:36:56.830 --> 02:37:05.778]  The list of the people at the Justice Department and FBI that we compiled that have either recused themselves, been fired or removed from the Deputy Director on down.
[02:37:05.778 --> 02:37:06.499]  There's the list.
[02:37:06.499 --> 02:37:08.881]  Obama, Lynch, Comey.
[02:37:09.782 --> 02:37:13.243]  Sally Yates, of course Hillary fired by not being elected.
[02:37:13.243 --> 02:37:26.628]  McCabe, Orr, Carlin, Page, Stork, Baker, Prinztap, and then on down literally all the same people hiring their wives and husbands at Fusion GPS for the fake dossier.
[02:37:26.628 --> 02:37:32.730]  McCain then delivers the fake dossier, got caught lying about it, just the way they tried to kangaroo court you into prison.
[02:37:32.730 --> 02:37:36.752]  This whole Russia thing about Trump, I mean you've been on the parallel rails
[02:37:37.432 --> 02:37:40.894]  Well, you know, it's sad because I spent, what, 30 years with the Federal Drug Enforcement.
[02:37:40.894 --> 02:37:44.196]  Most of the time in management, regional director, I can go on and on.
[02:37:59.159 --> 02:38:03.280]  And my whole life was dedicated in that federal system.
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:14.024]  And now what I'm hearing that's going on in Washington with our law enforcement agencies and officials and the federal courts, it's kind of sickening.
[02:38:14.024 --> 02:38:14.544]  But you know what?
[02:38:14.544 --> 02:38:16.724]  You got to be a fighter.
[02:38:16.724 --> 02:38:22.466]  I did run for sheriff in 92 and I got beat just last year.
[02:38:22.466 --> 02:38:25.007]  And you know the story behind that.
[02:38:25.849 --> 02:38:33.712]  And I went into retirement, decided to come out of retirement, which I really wasn't retired, I was still active in certain situations.
[02:38:33.712 --> 02:38:44.756]  So, I decided, my wife and I have been married 60 years, a couple of weeks ago, so I had to talk to her on this.
[02:38:44.756 --> 02:38:47.677]  And I decided to run for U.S.
[02:38:47.677 --> 02:38:49.678]  Senate with a flake seat.
[02:38:51.374 --> 02:38:53.635]  I'm going to take a lot of criticism, Alex.
[02:38:53.635 --> 02:38:59.579]  You know that right now they're hitting me in all ways you can think of.
[02:38:59.579 --> 02:39:13.567]  The head of the Democratic Party, Tom Perez, he's the one that did the hatchet job on me, according to orders from Obama, and now he's saying he's going to get me no matter what it takes.
[02:39:13.567 --> 02:39:15.369]  You know, he can be my guest.
[02:39:15.369 --> 02:39:20.772]  Call me a convicted criminal, the misdemeanor, attempt to coerce,
[02:39:21.502 --> 02:39:24.304]  Well, plus you were convicted by a Democrat operative judge.
[02:39:24.304 --> 02:39:31.869]  That's why parallel, if we can put that on full screen for people, of almost everyone in that small network of people,
[02:39:44.317 --> 02:39:46.118]  25 total, but only about 12 in the inner circle.
[02:39:46.118 --> 02:39:47.238]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[02:39:47.238 --> 02:39:50.379]  I mean, you know, we're not talking about many people.
[02:39:50.379 --> 02:39:51.719]  Total 20-something.
[02:39:51.719 --> 02:40:01.122]  And almost all of them have been totally discredited, and they're on their own email and text messages admitting it's a fraud, premeditatedly, to set the president up.
[02:40:01.122 --> 02:40:02.282]  Same thing on you.
[02:40:02.282 --> 02:40:03.883]  They're committed the crimes, not us!
[02:40:05.216 --> 02:40:11.799]  Well, but they don't know I have some information regarding that situation, negotiating and so on.
[02:40:11.799 --> 02:40:17.021]  So I'll be talking about that soon, the people behind that.
[02:40:17.021 --> 02:40:21.743]  So when they take me on, they seem to forget I'm not a typical politician.
[02:40:21.743 --> 02:40:23.284]  I'm a law enforcement official.
[02:40:23.942 --> 02:40:29.846]  I've been around as sheriff for 24 years, and then all my other experience.
[02:40:29.846 --> 02:40:31.968]  So I have information.
[02:40:31.968 --> 02:40:44.137]  I'm not some politician that goes by boat records and then they switch over at the last minute to say how great our president is, which of course he is.
[02:40:44.137 --> 02:40:52.103]  So when you're dealing with a law enforcement guy that does take on tough issues, including the fake
[02:40:52.754 --> 02:40:57.596]  Her certificate and how they went after me, the Justice Department.
[02:40:57.596 --> 02:41:00.858]  They're doing the same thing against Donald Trump.
[02:41:00.858 --> 02:41:15.624]  So I'm used to that and I feel sorry for the president and I'm going to, I hope, get elected to the Senate, be an ally in front of his and all, because that means it helps Arizona.
[02:41:15.624 --> 02:41:20.346]  His policies and agenda helps the people of Arizona that I expect to represent.
[02:41:21.926 --> 02:41:27.388]  Well, that's the bottom line is that we are all been on the same path, not as much as you or not as much as Trump.
[02:41:27.388 --> 02:41:30.248]  I mean, I've not personally been through what you've been through, but I'm a lot younger.
[02:41:30.248 --> 02:41:36.430]  I've experienced going after your kids, your family, your name, lying about you, trying to destroy your business, suing you.
[02:41:36.430 --> 02:41:41.932]  And that's why if somebody's good, standing up for the average person and really being wholesome, they're going to come after you.
[02:41:42.512 --> 02:41:45.054]  And it's the same thing, it's like Trump said two years ago.
[02:41:45.054 --> 02:41:49.376]  Look, the DREAM Act as it is, is a blank check to come in and bring your family in.
[02:41:49.376 --> 02:41:54.039]  If you can prove you've been here, been here legally since you were a kid, whatever, yeah, go to a judge, we'll let you stay.
[02:41:54.039 --> 02:41:57.941]  Then he says, we're going to do that now, they go, oh, the right wing says Trump's backtracking.
[02:41:57.941 --> 02:42:01.523]  No, that was the media misrepresenting, saying he hates Mexicans.
[02:42:01.523 --> 02:42:04.065]  Just like you always, you don't get lied about.
[02:42:04.065 --> 02:42:09.168]  And then they say you flip-flop when you say nice things, because they're misrepresenting what you really said.
[02:42:10.931 --> 02:42:18.921]  Yeah, well you're talking about all these activists and ACLU and you're talking about the news media.
[02:42:18.921 --> 02:42:21.244]  There's some good people in the news media.
[02:42:21.244 --> 02:42:22.365]  You know that.
[02:42:22.365 --> 02:42:23.787]  You're in the news media.
[02:42:23.787 --> 02:42:24.648]  You're a good guy.
[02:42:24.648 --> 02:42:26.049]  You're getting your message across.
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:39.090]  That's something you have to put up when you're high profile and they're zeroing in on you and using the power of the United States government with all their money and their agendas.
[02:42:39.090 --> 02:42:39.591]  It's sad.
[02:42:39.591 --> 02:42:40.532]  It's sad.
[02:42:40.532 --> 02:42:48.619]  Sure, let's come back and talk about the campaign and how we helped you get elected because it's a strong message to the establishment Republicans, the Democrats, everybody else.
[02:42:48.619 --> 02:42:52.944]  They're not going to be able to jackknife this like they did with Roy Moore if we get behind Sheriff Arpaio.
[02:42:54.042 --> 02:43:14.012]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:43:14.012 --> 02:43:16.133]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:43:16.133 --> 02:43:20.135]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:20.135 --> 02:43:21.156]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[02:43:21.576 --> 02:43:27.380]  We've got the best float-on free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:29.762]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:43:29.762 --> 02:43:35.205]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:43:35.205 --> 02:43:37.687]  Infowarslife.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:43:37.687 --> 02:43:46.893]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:43:46.893 --> 02:43:51.336]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:43:54.628 --> 02:43:55.429]  I'm so excited.
[02:43:55.429 --> 02:44:05.575]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:44:05.575 --> 02:44:11.079]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:44:11.079 --> 02:44:14.081]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:14.081 --> 02:44:22.867]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:44:24.968 --> 02:44:30.272]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[02:44:30.272 --> 02:44:35.216]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:44:35.216 --> 02:44:44.563]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:44.563 --> 02:44:47.225]  It is amazing!
[02:44:47.225 --> 02:44:52.209]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:44:55.325 --> 02:44:56.926]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:45:35.708 --> 02:45:37.749]  And this part is most important.

[02:45:44.554 --> 02:45:45.995]  That means it's clean.
[02:45:45.995 --> 02:45:47.116]  That means it's pure.

[02:46:09.295 --> 02:46:11.197]  On your order at InfoWareStore.com.

[02:46:19.145 --> 02:46:24.210]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.

[02:46:30.336 --> 02:46:33.819]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com, select your favorite product or products,
[02:46:33.959 --> 02:46:35.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:09.818 --> 02:47:17.902]  Welcome back, final segment with Sheriff Joe Arpaio, one of the most embattled individuals in modern history, a true fighter.
[02:47:17.902 --> 02:47:23.225]  Even if you disagree with his policies, you gotta admire how focused he is, how dedicated his energy.
[02:47:23.225 --> 02:47:28.888]  But then you actually study his real policies, he's a great guy, you see what the media says about him, it's total crap.
[02:47:28.888 --> 02:47:31.469]  I see stuff in the news all the time I never said.
[02:47:31.469 --> 02:47:34.450]  Hillary's killing kids in the basement of a pizza place.
[02:47:34.450 --> 02:47:37.472]  There's no video, there's no audio, they just make it up, cobble it together.
[02:47:38.447 --> 02:47:45.731]  Notice a lot of times you watch the news, so-called news, you'll see audio of me, but not the show that's also TV.
[02:47:45.731 --> 02:47:49.053]  Because they can edit the audio, folks, and it's just so frustrating.
[02:47:49.053 --> 02:47:51.114]  And I told people I'm going to start suing, folks.
[02:47:51.114 --> 02:48:03.681]  That was my next question for Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who's in a dead heat for the Republican primary there to be running for Senate, which is so important right now with them trying to get enough votes to impeach the president.
[02:48:04.341 --> 02:48:12.864]  Because a lot of Republican establishment folks, they're saying, might actually go with an impeachment if we lose the midterms in 2018, and just a seat or two could be key.
[02:48:12.864 --> 02:48:19.347]  So, could it be Trump that saved Arpaio from a fraudulent investigation, and that Arpaio saves Trump?
[02:48:19.347 --> 02:48:28.771]  That tends to be the way destiny works, but regardless, I don't go to the audience and bitch at you and say, hey, do more, buy more products, spread the articles, thank our affiliates more.
[02:48:28.771 --> 02:48:29.531]  I know you're doing a lot.
[02:48:30.256 --> 02:48:31.497]  We're all in a fight.
[02:48:31.497 --> 02:48:47.813]  So everybody needs to seriously go to Sheriff Joe for America dot com and they need to donate and they need to volunteer and they need to get involved because in the polls he's either ahead or neck and neck but you know they're going to have people voting in the names of dead people.
[02:48:47.813 --> 02:48:50.776]  You know they get the illegals and hop them all up and tell them he's the enemy.
[02:48:51.096 --> 02:48:55.301]  Just because he's for law and order and they're gonna try to vote against him and there's serious fraud in Arizona.
[02:48:55.301 --> 02:49:03.150]  So we need to get him 5, 10, 15 points ahead to even have a chance of winning like Trump did, which we can do if you take action.
[02:49:03.150 --> 02:49:04.852]  But this isn't about shooting our mouths off.
[02:49:04.852 --> 02:49:07.035]  It's about doing a show.
[02:49:07.035 --> 02:49:11.140]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, what can we do to make sure you win this primary?
[02:49:12.759 --> 02:49:14.620]  Well, just what you're doing now, Alex.
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:20.785]  I appreciate it, putting that word out and motivating my base.
[02:49:20.785 --> 02:49:24.387]  I never lost a Republican primary.
[02:49:24.387 --> 02:49:26.428]  Even in the last election, I won by 40%.
[02:49:26.428 --> 02:49:33.013]  I'm a Republican primary, so I have strong support across the state.
[02:49:33.013 --> 02:49:41.298]  I've had that for years and years, and I want to thank all the people in other counties for always supporting me
[02:49:42.359 --> 02:49:52.727]  Not that they could vote for me and so on, but I've been campaigning, not campaigning, giving speeches constantly, not only there, but recently across the nation.
[02:49:52.727 --> 02:49:55.709]  And I've been doing that, helping the Republican Party.
[02:49:57.645 --> 02:50:07.891]  Donald Trump ran, remember way back in June of 15, he announced and he came here for his first rally in July, 2015.
[02:50:07.891 --> 02:50:10.412]  I introduced him.
[02:50:10.412 --> 02:50:14.315]  You couldn't get any politics again on a stage, but I did.
[02:50:14.315 --> 02:50:17.076]  I never met him prior to that.
[02:50:17.076 --> 02:50:18.897]  I liked what I heard.
[02:50:18.897 --> 02:50:21.979]  And I said, he will be the next president.
[02:50:21.979 --> 02:50:23.540]  And he is, he made it.
[02:50:24.415 --> 02:50:28.598]  And I'll tell you, I don't go against people that I endorse.
[02:50:28.598 --> 02:50:30.740]  I stick with them to the bitter end.
[02:50:30.740 --> 02:50:32.621]  Especially President Trump.
[02:50:32.621 --> 02:50:34.843]  I'm with him to the bitter end.
[02:50:34.843 --> 02:50:36.063]  I don't like to say bitter.
[02:50:36.063 --> 02:50:38.165]  It's going to be a successful end.
[02:50:38.165 --> 02:50:39.086]  But you know what I'm talking about.
[02:50:39.086 --> 02:50:42.188]  But like Churchill said, we're going to defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[02:50:42.188 --> 02:50:45.951]  We're going to go on to the end, and we'll never surrender.
[02:50:45.951 --> 02:50:46.711]  Yeah.
[02:50:46.711 --> 02:50:48.092]  I don't surrender either.
[02:50:48.092 --> 02:50:50.414]  And I talked to my wife.
[02:50:50.414 --> 02:50:51.314]  We've been married 60...
[02:50:54.079 --> 02:50:55.119]  Years?
[02:50:55.119 --> 02:50:55.820]  Two weeks ago.
[02:50:55.820 --> 02:50:57.400]  I'm not forgetting that.
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:51:01.101]  I'm trying to get to times, man, just about two weeks ago.
[02:51:01.101 --> 02:51:02.341]  Talked to her about running.
[02:51:02.341 --> 02:51:03.181]  She's tough, too.
[02:51:03.181 --> 02:51:05.102]  This isn't easy for her.
[02:51:05.102 --> 02:51:07.983]  But I'm doing it not for just the president.
[02:51:07.983 --> 02:51:09.943]  I'm doing it for our country.
[02:51:09.943 --> 02:51:11.624]  I'm doing it for Arizona.
[02:51:11.624 --> 02:51:14.905]  You know, we have two senators here.
[02:51:14.905 --> 02:51:19.786]  They're not good friends of the president.
[02:51:20.342 --> 02:51:28.768]  Well, he's going to have, I'm going to go to Washington and I'm not going to rubber stamp everything he does, but I'll tell you one thing.
[02:51:28.768 --> 02:51:33.411]  I'm never going to go against him, even after he makes a decision.
[02:51:33.411 --> 02:51:37.574]  I mean, I'd agree with it, but he's still the commander in chief.
[02:51:37.574 --> 02:51:39.635]  He still runs this country.
[02:51:39.635 --> 02:51:42.857]  I still support the people of Arizona.
[02:51:42.857 --> 02:51:47.881]  And if there is a disagreement, I will talk to the people of Arizona and let them know
[02:51:51.291 --> 02:51:54.672]  But I can't, I can't, I can't go back against him.
[02:51:54.672 --> 02:51:56.453]  It's not in my style.
[02:51:56.453 --> 02:52:06.456]  Sure, and I mean, Flake is a Democrat, a backstabber, he's a total joke, and I feel sorry for folks who have the name Flake, but if the name fits, if the shoe fits, a Flake by any other name is still a Flake.
[02:52:06.456 --> 02:52:14.119]  You've got these flaky rhinos, and again, what you've done versus what they said about you, all the fights, the fact that you're committed to do this,
[02:52:14.699 --> 02:52:26.784]  This is all the more reason for everybody to get involved, and imagine how angry they're going to be if you end up being the guy that takes Flake's seat, and you are so incredibly close.
[02:52:26.784 --> 02:52:30.986]  Well, you know, I'm going there for the people of Arizona.
[02:52:30.986 --> 02:52:33.567]  I'm not part of what they call the establishment.
[02:52:33.567 --> 02:52:36.008]  You know, I get along with everybody.
[02:52:36.008 --> 02:52:44.271]  Even in foreign countries, I get along with... Yeah, but the establishment is anti-American globalists, so just because you're not anti-government, you're pro-American government, but you are anti-globalist.
[02:52:46.018 --> 02:52:48.900]  Yeah, and by the way, not just law enforcement.
[02:52:48.900 --> 02:53:00.950]  I love what the President's policies are, whether it's the patriotism, the economy, how he speaks out, because when you speak out, it's a deterrence.
[02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:04.753]  That's why illegal immigration has gone down, because I've been through all this.
[02:53:04.753 --> 02:53:09.457]  He went out public, and he told everybody, you come across the border, you're going to get locked up.
[02:53:09.457 --> 02:53:12.559]  Well, that's a big deterrence when the President is saying that.
[02:53:12.559 --> 02:53:15.322]  So maybe they're not coming across the border, because they know
[02:53:15.902 --> 02:53:18.063]  He said, you're going to be locked up.
[02:53:18.063 --> 02:53:18.424]  Exactly.
[02:53:18.424 --> 02:53:20.605]  Let's expand on that.
[02:53:20.605 --> 02:53:34.953]  Who would think 11 months and 21 days into the presidency, we'd have a 25,000 stock market, 3.3% growth rate, 2 million new jobs, the biggest startups ever, the lowest black unemployment ever.
[02:53:34.953 --> 02:53:37.715]  And I try to tweet lowest black unemployment numbers ever.
[02:53:37.715 --> 02:53:39.036]  Twitter blocks it.
[02:53:39.036 --> 02:53:40.977]  I mean, the censorship is insane.
[02:53:43.138 --> 02:53:44.219]  That's sad.
[02:53:44.219 --> 02:53:47.100]  That is very sad.
[02:53:47.100 --> 02:53:51.643]  You know, when they talk about the president's polls, which nobody should believe.
[02:53:51.643 --> 02:53:53.044]  Exactly.
[02:53:53.044 --> 02:53:55.666]  You know how they're stacking the deck.
[02:53:55.666 --> 02:53:57.046]  But what about Congress?
[02:53:57.046 --> 02:53:59.748]  They're way lower than the president.
[02:53:59.748 --> 02:54:00.889]  What about the media?
[02:54:00.889 --> 02:54:02.429]  They're way down there.
[02:54:02.429 --> 02:54:04.551]  I guess car salesmen get the same.
[02:54:05.521 --> 02:54:06.561]  Sorry, both.
[02:54:06.561 --> 02:54:07.762]  Well, you know what it is, Joe?
[02:54:07.762 --> 02:54:10.782]  There's a lot of cowards when they get called or get a poll sent to them.
[02:54:10.782 --> 02:54:15.144]  They don't want to say they support Trump because they think it might hurt them.
[02:54:15.144 --> 02:54:19.325]  But they have the computer bots on these apps, mainly.
[02:54:19.325 --> 02:54:23.146]  And we knew before the election, Trump was 15 points ahead, according to Silicon Valley.
[02:54:23.146 --> 02:54:24.906]  That's why they were panicking so hard.
[02:54:24.906 --> 02:54:28.307]  There was even articles about it that he was 15 points ahead.
[02:54:28.307 --> 02:54:34.689]  And that, I mean, look at all the evidence of fraud versus, and I'm not getting into whether Moore was good or bad, the point was,
[02:54:35.149 --> 02:54:39.872]  Judge Roy Moore, they said he was 15 points behind, but he lost by half a point.
[02:54:39.872 --> 02:54:43.614]  And then they had all these Democrats on video saying, we came here to vote.
[02:54:43.614 --> 02:54:48.217]  We came here to, I mean, they're admittedly in fraud.
[02:54:48.217 --> 02:55:00.985]  Yeah, I'm a little suspicious of what happened to me with, you know, this billionaire, George Soros, pumped in over three and a half million dollars against me in 30 days.
[02:55:02.262 --> 02:55:03.203]  Come on!
[02:55:03.203 --> 02:55:13.192]  The Justice Department, the day before early voting, before a judge would not give me a bench trial on this misdemeanor, said they're going to charge me.
[02:55:13.192 --> 02:55:19.638]  Two weeks later, they charged me with a misdemeanor, said I'm going to go to prison for six months.
[02:55:19.638 --> 02:55:20.518]  Think of that!
[02:55:20.518 --> 02:55:26.264]  In the midst of an election, people voting, violation of the Department of Justice guidelines,
[02:55:26.924 --> 02:55:27.744]  They hit me?
[02:55:27.744 --> 02:55:29.585]  Why didn't they do it a little earlier?
[02:55:29.585 --> 02:55:33.466]  They've been after me since Obama took off in 60 days.
[02:55:33.466 --> 02:55:40.789]  So after all these years, they end up getting me on a contempt of court because a judge who has his bias
[02:55:41.556 --> 02:55:45.537]  Threw it over to have a criminal investigation.
[02:55:45.537 --> 02:55:46.397]  Think of that.
[02:55:46.397 --> 02:55:46.877]  Unbelievable.
[02:55:46.877 --> 02:55:48.998]  But that's okay.
[02:55:48.998 --> 02:55:50.278]  I'm going to Washington.
[02:55:50.278 --> 02:55:52.619]  I'm going to straighten a lot of things out.
[02:55:52.619 --> 02:55:55.619]  If they don't put me on any committees, okay.
[02:55:55.619 --> 02:55:57.640]  I'll form my own committees.
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:55:59.220]  So, we'll see what happens.
[02:55:59.220 --> 02:56:03.421]  And that's what the President's going to do in six days with his fake news awards.
[02:56:03.421 --> 02:56:04.842]  We're just taking the narrative back.
[02:56:04.842 --> 02:56:06.922]  And, you know, they censor us off everything else.
[02:56:06.922 --> 02:56:09.783]  We just create our own systems.
[02:56:09.783 --> 02:56:10.263]  That's right.
[02:56:11.042 --> 02:56:14.823]  And once again, the President knows what he's doing.
[02:56:14.823 --> 02:56:17.003]  I think that's what really scares everybody.
[02:56:17.003 --> 02:56:18.364]  That's why they keep going after him.
[02:56:18.364 --> 02:56:22.085]  Yeah, they're saying he's an idiot and mentally ill and all this.
[02:56:22.085 --> 02:56:22.805]  Well, that's the case.
[02:56:22.805 --> 02:56:23.645]  We need more of that.
[02:56:23.645 --> 02:56:26.466]  SheriffJoeForAmerica.com.
[02:56:26.466 --> 02:56:28.646]  And we hope people go and donate and support.
[02:56:28.646 --> 02:56:30.127]  And we'll track as you go.
[02:56:30.127 --> 02:56:32.407]  I've got a gut feeling you're going to win if people get behind you.
[02:56:32.407 --> 02:56:34.288]  But regardless, you're going to inject real ideas.
[02:56:34.288 --> 02:56:35.348]  I've got to say it.
[02:56:35.988 --> 02:56:37.049]  We gotta admire fighters.
[02:56:37.049 --> 02:56:38.730]  Compare Sheriff Joe to these millennials.
[02:56:38.730 --> 02:56:41.792]  A lot of them are great folks, but just so entitled, so lazy.
[02:56:41.792 --> 02:56:48.275]  This fellow, for his country, fighting super hard and sharper than, you know, 20-year-olds out there when he's 80-plus years old.
[02:56:48.275 --> 02:56:49.416]  I don't say that as a bad thing.
[02:56:49.416 --> 02:56:50.817]  It's a positive thing.
[02:56:50.817 --> 02:56:55.920]  And we're very, very proud of you, Sheriff Joe, for everything you've done and letting them attack you and lie about you.
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:56:57.821]  We really appreciate you.
[02:56:57.821 --> 02:56:58.561]  Thank you.
[02:56:58.561 --> 02:56:59.082]  Thanks, Howard.
[02:56:59.784 --> 02:57:00.285]  I don't think so.
[02:57:18.436 --> 02:57:22.339]  Russia or Mexico or anywhere else to just walk across and go have a baby for free.
[02:57:22.339 --> 02:57:23.319]  We don't hate anybody.
[02:57:23.319 --> 02:57:25.220]  And they just turned it into this now.
[02:57:25.220 --> 02:57:30.344]  And then some of the minorities that buy into this, who are now the majority, actually think everybody hates them.
[02:57:30.344 --> 02:57:33.866]  And then they get racist and that makes more racists on the other side.
[02:57:33.866 --> 02:57:35.947]  The globalists are using us against each other.
[02:57:35.947 --> 02:57:39.590]  And they hate people like Arpaio because he wants to bring back prosperity.
[02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:40.490]  Spread the live links.
[02:57:40.490 --> 02:57:41.071]  We need your help.

[02:58:46.147 --> 02:58:48.748]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[02:58:48.748 --> 02:59:03.335]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[02:59:03.335 --> 02:59:10.538]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:59:10.938 --> 02:59:11.459]  Well, thank you.
[02:59:11.459 --> 02:59:16.382]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread on Me, but instead it says Won't Tread on Me.
[02:59:16.382 --> 02:59:19.325]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[02:59:19.325 --> 02:59:22.607]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[02:59:22.607 --> 02:59:28.852]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:59:28.852 --> 02:59:31.494]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[02:59:32.014 --> 02:59:38.859]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:59:38.859 --> 02:59:47.605]  That is the new Shirt of the Mind, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:47.605 --> 02:59:50.307]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.802 --> 03:00:11.648]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:00:11.648 --> 03:00:13.810]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.810 --> 03:00:16.092]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:00:16.092 --> 03:00:20.576]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[03:00:27.523 --> 03:00:31.284]  Now, if you're a new viewer or listener, you need to listen very, very carefully.
[03:00:31.284 --> 03:00:45.587]  But if you're a regular listener or viewer, we're live, but once this is posted to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, you name it, I am begging you to take this video and get it out to everybody you know.
[03:00:45.587 --> 03:00:52.048]  If I walk around this office, if I walk out there in that control room, a lot of folks don't want to go on air and that's fine,
[03:00:52.927 --> 03:00:59.632]  I can point to this person's child died after taking a vaccine in that control room.
[03:00:59.632 --> 03:01:06.718]  This person took the typhoid oral and made her super, super sick.
[03:01:06.718 --> 03:01:08.099]  And they admitted it made her sick.
[03:01:08.099 --> 03:01:11.581]  And they said, this may make it, we can never take any other vaccines again.
[03:01:11.581 --> 03:01:17.086]  And this man volunteers at Dell Children's Hospital, works at radio and TV, great guy.
[03:01:17.086 --> 03:01:22.450]  And he took the flu shot a month ago and got deathly ill and hadn't been there for a couple of weeks.
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:27.402]  My dad's retired, semi-retired oral surgeon.
[03:01:27.402 --> 03:01:29.082]  He has all these patients he's had for decades.
[03:01:29.082 --> 03:01:31.284]  They come in, he sees them, they die.
[03:01:31.284 --> 03:01:35.406]  He talks to their husbands and wives, they go, oh, we all took the shingles shot.
[03:01:35.406 --> 03:01:43.510]  He knew a couple people in a month, a couple years ago, before he semi-retired, that were his long-term patients that died after they took the shingles shot.
[03:01:43.510 --> 03:01:49.813]  Which is basically just like a form of herpes that you get across your body, but you take the vaccine.
[03:01:49.813 --> 03:01:53.195]  But one of our crew, and I'm not knocking the others, I don't want to be public, I'm just saying,
[03:01:54.326 --> 03:01:56.408]  Oprah's like, you get a car, you get a car.
[03:01:56.408 --> 03:01:57.449]  You get a dead child.
[03:01:57.449 --> 03:01:58.309]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:59.430]  It's terrible.
[03:01:59.430 --> 03:02:01.852]  You get, you know, to get super sick.
[03:02:01.852 --> 03:02:03.574]  You get to almost die of the flu.
[03:02:03.574 --> 03:02:06.476]  You get to have a convulsion.
[03:02:06.476 --> 03:02:08.218]  We're doing this to warn people.
[03:02:08.218 --> 03:02:11.581]  My mother was a triathlete who didn't get into it until she was like 35.
[03:02:11.581 --> 03:02:17.525]  She was winning gold and silver medals at the regional and national level against former Olympic athletes.
[03:02:17.525 --> 03:02:19.887]  The team told her at UT, take the shot.
[03:02:19.887 --> 03:02:22.229]  She was sick for a month, almost died.
[03:02:22.229 --> 03:02:22.450]  Done.
[03:02:23.516 --> 03:02:26.917]  at like 48 years old.
[03:02:26.917 --> 03:02:39.942]  So, we're joined by Connor Yarbrough, one of our great producers and engineers here, just in the next few minutes to tell you the story about what happened to him in the so-called flu shot.
[03:02:39.942 --> 03:02:48.725]  Because we got the studies that doubles your chances of getting the flu shot, of getting the flu the next year, or that it never matches up with mutations or doesn't help you, but
[03:02:49.653 --> 03:02:53.596]  We can show you the news articles where MMR admittedly gives people measles, mumps, rubella.
[03:02:53.596 --> 03:02:56.999]  We can show you that the mumps outbreak is directly tied to the vaccine.
[03:02:56.999 --> 03:03:00.301]  Or my grandmother said, oh yeah, I got the second polio vaccine.
[03:03:00.301 --> 03:03:02.523]  And they told me I got polio a week later of that strain.
[03:03:02.523 --> 03:03:06.305]  And the doctors told me I got it from a live polio vaccine in 1950-whatever.
[03:03:06.305 --> 03:03:10.489]  She just died last year and was basically handicapped her whole life after she had my mom and my uncle.
[03:03:11.877 --> 03:03:12.657]  Enough of me.
[03:03:12.657 --> 03:03:15.058]  We'll probably hold him over the next segment a little bit.
[03:03:15.058 --> 03:03:24.901]  Why don't you tell folks, Connor Yarbrough, we appreciate you coming on air, what just, I mean, you look like you lost, you weren't a skinny guy before, you look good, but looks like you lost, what, 25 pounds?
[03:03:24.901 --> 03:03:25.742]  What happened?
[03:03:25.742 --> 03:03:41.247]  I did lose a little bit of weight over the last few days, but what happened was, so, like you said, I volunteer at a local area children's hospital, and as a requirement, we are expected to get the flu shot, you know, and to make sure that we don't spread any chance of the flu getting to any of the kids in the hospital there.
[03:03:41.807 --> 03:03:54.770]  Um, I got the shot about late November, and around last Friday, I started feeling a little icky after I got out of work here, and I thought it may have been due to a lot of the dust from a lot of the work me and the other engineers have been doing around here.
[03:03:54.770 --> 03:03:57.650]  I thought maybe I just got some allergies or something.
[03:03:57.650 --> 03:04:00.531]  Went home that evening, started having some chills.
[03:04:00.531 --> 03:04:03.651]  Next thing I knew, I was in bed the entire past weekend.
[03:04:03.651 --> 03:04:10.673]  Thankfully, I just coincidentally had a doctor's appointment come Monday, and surely enough, they figured out it was the flu right away.
[03:04:11.493 --> 03:04:18.177]  I mean, I still don't sound entirely too great right now, but I've been on Tamiflu this entire past week.
[03:04:18.177 --> 03:04:23.841]  I'm probably going to be out of the Children's Hospital for at least the next, oh, I don't know, good couple of weeks here.
[03:04:23.841 --> 03:04:35.929]  And, I mean, reports have said that about 25% of the admitted cases to that Children's Hospital right now have been for the flu, and this has been one of the biggest outbreaks Texas has seen in quite some time.
[03:04:35.929 --> 03:04:40.612]  So, you know, this is definitely one of the more severe cases that this area has ever seen.
[03:04:41.833 --> 03:04:46.058]  For me, you know, this is definitely one of the sickest I've ever felt.
[03:04:46.058 --> 03:04:48.240]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:50.623]  Everybody knows, take the flu shot, get sick.
[03:04:50.623 --> 03:04:51.023]  Stay with us.
[03:04:53.263 --> 03:04:57.666]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[03:04:57.666 --> 03:05:05.752]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:05:05.752 --> 03:05:11.056]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:05:11.056 --> 03:05:13.578]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:05:13.578 --> 03:05:17.801]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:05:17.801 --> 03:05:20.243]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:05:20.925 --> 03:05:28.147]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:05:28.147 --> 03:05:36.229]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:05:36.229 --> 03:05:43.411]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:05:43.411 --> 03:05:44.871]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[03:05:44.871 --> 03:05:46.672]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[03:05:47.492 --> 03:05:50.973]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[03:05:50.973 --> 03:05:54.354]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:54.354 --> 03:05:58.956]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:05:58.956 --> 03:06:00.736]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:28.322 --> 03:06:32.963]  You know, I hate talking about it, but it's something I gotta do.
[03:06:32.963 --> 03:06:38.864]  Again, my grandmother, back in the early 50s, great lady, just died last year.
[03:06:38.864 --> 03:06:41.125]  Penny Grace Hammond.
[03:06:41.125 --> 03:06:46.086]  She, during the whole polio outbreak, went and got her first polio shot with the first strain.
[03:06:46.086 --> 03:06:48.626]  A couple months later, they said, you need to get the new strain.
[03:06:48.626 --> 03:06:49.346]  She went and got it.
[03:06:49.346 --> 03:06:52.487]  A week later, that's what it takes, about seven days, she got it.
[03:06:52.487 --> 03:06:56.608]  And the doctor told her, well, you had a bad reaction to the live virus.
[03:06:58.254 --> 03:07:02.419]  Which I guess they thought had been attenuated somehow or was a watered-down virus.
[03:07:02.419 --> 03:07:08.466]  And she ate the nerves in about half her body and she refused to be in a wheelchair until she was about 92.
[03:07:12.955 --> 03:07:13.595]  I think so.
[03:07:33.264 --> 03:07:56.623]  uh... and and and had one breast removed and didn't like it so she said she got cancer again she said I'm just gonna let it so she had obviously cancer probably all over her body when she died but she refused to be seen by the doctors but you know what the very breast cancer she had over to her files is the is one associated with SV40 that was also in the polio shot so they didn't just give you the polio virus they gave you simian virus associated with uh...
[03:07:57.484 --> 03:08:02.006]  Fatty tissue and hormone based and I'm not a cancer doctor.
[03:08:02.006 --> 03:08:05.488]  I've just had probably 50 of them on over the years and have the top papers on it.
[03:08:05.488 --> 03:08:11.631]  And so evidence shows the doctors told her we gave you polio, but they probably gave her breast cancer as well.
[03:08:11.631 --> 03:08:16.494]  So again, you need to research SV 40 and all of it for yourself.
[03:08:18.018 --> 03:08:33.346]  I had the head of one of the biggest chains of pediatric facilities, because he was not anti-vaccine, but he put in the file online, when I first started having children 15 years ago, that you did not have to be vaccine, he wouldn't kick you out of his clinic.
[03:08:33.346 --> 03:08:40.930]  And I went there, and a couple times I brought my son, and another daughter, and I've been there a few years, and I finally got that doctor.
[03:08:40.930 --> 03:08:42.091]  His first name began with an H.
[03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:45.131]  And he said, he goes, you know, I like your show.
[03:08:45.131 --> 03:08:45.751]  You're actually right.
[03:08:45.751 --> 03:08:50.833]  He goes, you know, we're giving people 1960s live polio vaccine at these free government clinics.
[03:08:50.833 --> 03:08:54.015]  And Alex, it's illegal since the 1970s to give it.
[03:08:54.015 --> 03:08:57.016]  It's got wide spectrum cancer virus.
[03:08:57.016 --> 03:08:58.217]  And I said, no, no, I know.
[03:08:58.217 --> 03:08:58.877]  They're always shocked.
[03:08:58.877 --> 03:08:59.578]  Somebody knows this.
[03:08:59.578 --> 03:09:02.239]  He goes, OK, I just want to say you're right.
[03:09:02.239 --> 03:09:02.799]  He walks out.
[03:09:02.799 --> 03:09:03.559]  He comes back in the room.
[03:09:03.559 --> 03:09:04.320]  He's a big guy.
[03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:07.041]  He grabs him by the arm like a linebacker.
[03:09:07.041 --> 03:09:07.761]  He had a big beard.
[03:09:07.761 --> 03:09:10.102]  He goes hard by almost hitting.
[03:09:10.102 --> 03:09:12.984]  He goes, don't you tell anybody I told you that, though.
[03:09:14.272 --> 03:09:17.514]  I said, just don't say my name, just don't say my name.
[03:09:17.514 --> 03:09:19.795]  And he shuffles out.
[03:09:19.795 --> 03:09:24.398]  So that was a guy doing what he thought was right because he knew how dangerous it was.
[03:09:24.398 --> 03:09:28.820]  You know, they put syphilis in black people's vaccines.
[03:09:28.820 --> 03:09:36.044]  Hillary apologized for what was going on in Peru, putting it in their vaccines and giving it to millions of Peruvians, ended up getting it.
[03:09:36.044 --> 03:09:36.884]  They gave it to over 100,000.
[03:09:36.884 --> 03:09:42.988]  They'd shoot these black men up with syphilis and then they'd let them go to go be promiscuous and spread it.
[03:09:44.076 --> 03:09:47.299]  Microscopic worm that eats your brain.
[03:09:47.299 --> 03:09:51.883]  So, remember, it's not just science that they say we're against, it's that...
[03:09:52.807 --> 03:09:57.568]  If you look at the studies, even if the flu shot doesn't give you the flu, it never guesses the right mutation.
[03:09:57.568 --> 03:09:58.749]  This is admitted.
[03:09:58.749 --> 03:10:03.750]  And in Canadian and British studies, it lowers your immunity for at least a year to flu by 50%.
[03:10:03.750 --> 03:10:08.532]  So a lot of people say, oh my God, I went and got the flu shot and I got it two weeks later.
[03:10:08.532 --> 03:10:14.754]  And I want to just blame the flu shot because they've been caught adding stuff and stimulants and the HV, you know, all the rest of it.
[03:10:14.754 --> 03:10:18.155]  And the H1N1 that was a swine flu variant.
[03:10:19.403 --> 03:10:27.046]  But a lot of times it's not really giving you the flu, it's lowering your immune system to get the other flu viruses, thousands of which there are.
[03:10:27.046 --> 03:10:33.930]  And Mr. Rappaport of NoMoreFakeNews.com, some of the biggest news outlets out there, and they've been exposing him for decades, he's really an expert on this.
[03:10:33.930 --> 03:10:38.892]  He's got a bunch of other topics to cover, but I wanted to have Connor Yarbrough finish up
[03:10:39.973 --> 03:10:43.376]  Just his experience of volunteering, he's done for years at Dell Children's.
[03:10:43.376 --> 03:10:46.158]  They tell the nurses, everybody take the shot.
[03:10:46.158 --> 03:10:50.162]  Because you were saying off-air, you've had the flu in how many years?
[03:10:50.162 --> 03:10:51.323]  You're a really healthy guy.
[03:10:51.972 --> 03:10:57.496]  Last time I had the flu was in 2009, and that was when I had H1N1, actually.
[03:10:57.496 --> 03:11:02.820]  But I didn't even take a vaccine around that point in time, and I haven't taken the flu shot in years.
[03:11:02.820 --> 03:11:11.087]  I'm, you know, I've always been a believer into that myth, or however you want to describe it, is when you get the flu shot, you get the flu, and so I've just never gotten it.
[03:11:11.087 --> 03:11:14.389]  This is the first time I've gotten the flu shot, probably
[03:11:15.330 --> 03:11:21.695]  Gosh, as long as I can remember, and lo and behold, I actually got the flu this time around.
[03:11:21.695 --> 03:11:35.666]  So, you know, I mean, it's, I don't want to say it's true or not, but I mean, it's the way you put it, you know, I mean, it definitely felt like something was weakened within me that I ended up contracting something where I definitely got incredibly, incredibly sick.
[03:11:35.666 --> 03:11:37.068]  I mean, this past weekend, you know, I mean,
[03:11:37.608 --> 03:11:39.250]  I couldn't sleep very well.
[03:11:39.250 --> 03:11:42.333]  I was in and out of consciousness a lot throughout sleeping.
[03:11:42.333 --> 03:11:46.597]  I'd wake up sometimes, my whole bed was just absolutely soaked in sweat.
[03:11:46.597 --> 03:11:49.640]  And it's the most miserable I've felt in a good while.
[03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:54.925]  I mean, you can still tell in my voice right now, things are still not entirely leveled off yet at this point.
[03:11:55.265 --> 03:11:57.086]  And by the way, people don't need to believe me.
[03:11:57.086 --> 03:11:58.107]  You can go read the studies.
[03:11:58.107 --> 03:11:59.307]  You can type into a search engine.
[03:11:59.307 --> 03:11:59.868]  They bury it.
[03:11:59.868 --> 03:12:01.949]  You gotta look.
[03:12:01.949 --> 03:12:10.574]  CDC, you know, CBC, Canadian Broadcasting, government report, taking the flu shot, double chances of flu next season.
[03:12:10.574 --> 03:12:12.995]  There's a British NIH report.
[03:12:12.995 --> 03:12:14.056]  This is all there.
[03:12:14.056 --> 03:12:16.237]  Thank you for sharing your story, because I don't make the
[03:12:16.377 --> 03:12:17.098]  I mean, in that control room!
[03:12:40.214 --> 03:12:43.896]  It is like Armageddon from all of this.
[03:12:43.896 --> 03:12:46.178]  And so let's just understand that.
[03:12:46.178 --> 03:12:47.839]  Let's go ahead and go to John Rappaport.
[03:12:47.839 --> 03:12:50.821]  Spend three minutes here just on this topic yourself.
[03:12:50.821 --> 03:12:51.702]  I know you've got a lot to cover.
[03:12:51.702 --> 03:12:53.002]  I'm going to hand the baton over to you, my friend.
[03:12:53.002 --> 03:12:55.024]  Go ahead.
[03:12:55.024 --> 03:13:00.407]  Well, Alex, I mean, this is a straight out truth delivered right from the shoulder.
[03:13:00.407 --> 03:13:03.949]  These things, these vaccines are destructive.
[03:13:03.949 --> 03:13:05.611]  They have nothing to do with health.
[03:13:07.541 --> 03:13:15.487]  People have to understand, thousands and thousands of doctors, mainstream doctors, they understand this, just like this doc that you talked to.
[03:13:15.487 --> 03:13:17.548]  They know what's going on.
[03:13:17.548 --> 03:13:27.175]  They understand that the whole idea of vaccination involves what they call adverse effects, meaning destruction.
[03:13:27.175 --> 03:13:29.757]  Destruction of the body, destruction of the immune system,
[03:13:30.781 --> 03:13:33.682]  Chronic allergies, autism, you name it.
[03:13:33.682 --> 03:13:35.363]  They know that.
[03:13:35.363 --> 03:13:46.508]  Everyone I know that's been in the military, special operations, enlisted, Delta Force, you name it, says they were totally healthy, they'd give a hundred guys the shot, twenty of them get sick, one of them would die.
[03:13:46.508 --> 03:13:48.729]  I mean, they know.
[03:13:48.729 --> 03:13:49.530]  Exactly.
[03:13:49.530 --> 03:13:53.551]  And that was, you know, the anthrax shot and other shots.
[03:13:53.551 --> 03:13:56.753]  And who knows what they put into all of that stuff.
[03:13:56.753 --> 03:13:56.933]  So,
[03:13:57.757 --> 03:13:59.898]  This is like an open secret we're talking about.
[03:13:59.898 --> 03:14:04.299]  It's like an open sewer inside the medical cartel.
[03:14:04.299 --> 03:14:06.459]  And the doctors know it.
[03:14:06.459 --> 03:14:07.940]  Medical reporters know it.
[03:14:07.940 --> 03:14:11.060]  I've talked to them off the record over the years.
[03:14:11.060 --> 03:14:14.361]  And they're just too afraid to say anything.
[03:14:14.361 --> 03:14:17.282]  They refuse to come out into the light and say it.
[03:14:17.282 --> 03:14:25.104]  And now they're getting bullied where they're saying, fine, you all have to take the 50-something vaccines every year, or even if you're in accounting, a mile away from the hospital, you're fired.
[03:14:26.064 --> 03:14:27.005]  Exactly.
[03:14:27.005 --> 03:14:29.107]  That's their only strategy.
[03:14:29.107 --> 03:14:36.334]  You know, if they leave it up to people's choice and intelligence, the whole vaccine establishment is going down in flames.
[03:14:36.334 --> 03:14:40.818]  So they say, well, we just have to pass laws that we enforce if necessary.
[03:14:40.818 --> 03:14:46.324]  It's a point of a gun in order to get people to take vaccines and to get their kids to take vaccines.
[03:14:46.324 --> 03:14:50.608]  I mean, in one province in a state in Australia right now,
[03:14:51.471 --> 03:14:53.112]  They're just invoking a rule.
[03:14:53.112 --> 03:14:55.134]  No kid goes to child care.
[03:14:55.134 --> 03:14:56.235]  That's it.
[03:14:56.235 --> 03:14:58.316]  Unless you've had the full schedule of vaccines.
[03:14:58.316 --> 03:15:00.778]  And now they want you to have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[03:15:00.778 --> 03:15:02.439]  It's just, it never ends.
[03:15:02.439 --> 03:15:05.442]  And they have liability protection to do whatever they want.
[03:15:05.442 --> 03:15:05.922]  Exactly.
[03:15:05.922 --> 03:15:06.182]  1986.
[03:15:06.182 --> 03:15:09.244]  They're off the hook since then.
[03:15:09.244 --> 03:15:15.249]  The vaccine companies cannot be sued for any childhood vaccine injury or destruction or death.
[03:15:16.272 --> 03:15:20.034]  You listen to the mothers talk about what happened to their children.
[03:15:20.034 --> 03:15:21.435]  They're giving it to you straight.
[03:15:21.435 --> 03:15:26.077]  Sometimes they die at the doctor's office.
[03:15:26.077 --> 03:15:26.917]  Right.
[03:15:26.917 --> 03:15:27.478]  Exactly.
[03:15:27.478 --> 03:15:30.039]  And the doctors say, well, it has nothing to do with the vaccine.
[03:15:32.543 --> 03:15:38.048]  That's why you get me on this subject, because I had my wife thrown out of that clinic that that guy founded and created.
[03:15:38.048 --> 03:15:45.415]  My children were still going there, but the newest baby, they just chewed her out, tried to pressure her and said, you get out of here for not giving your baby all these shots.
[03:15:45.415 --> 03:15:47.297]  And then you talk to the doctors behind the scenes.
[03:15:47.297 --> 03:15:48.818]  They don't give their kids the shots.
[03:15:48.818 --> 03:15:50.280]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[03:15:52.290 --> 03:15:54.873]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[03:15:54.873 --> 03:15:57.016]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[03:15:57.016 --> 03:15:58.978]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[03:18:13.579 --> 03:18:20.601]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:18:20.601 --> 03:18:27.764]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:18:28.784 --> 03:18:33.845]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:18:33.845 --> 03:18:41.487]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:18:41.487 --> 03:18:46.388]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[03:18:46.388 --> 03:18:49.309]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.

[03:19:14.706 --> 03:19:22.170]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[03:19:22.170 --> 03:19:32.555]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[03:19:32.555 --> 03:19:39.338]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[03:19:39.338 --> 03:19:41.919]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.
[03:19:42.219 --> 03:19:45.820]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride free products.
[03:19:45.820 --> 03:19:50.802]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:50.802 --> 03:19:56.824]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:56.824 --> 03:19:59.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.027 --> 03:20:17.528]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:17.528 --> 03:20:20.929]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.929 --> 03:20:26.711]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:20:26.711 --> 03:20:30.752]  Okay, John Rappaport sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour here at InfoWars.
[03:20:32.148 --> 03:20:40.113]  So I just want you to understand and know that these New Year's extended specials are extended at InfoWars.
[03:20:40.113 --> 03:20:49.258]  That means Survival Shield X2, Alpha Power, Secret 12, Supermail Vitality, all 50% off.
[03:20:49.258 --> 03:20:55.642]  So you look into that because that's only happening now until supplies are gone.
[03:20:56.474 --> 03:21:04.678]  Because InfoWars has had to take off Brain Force and Super Blue because extreme demand ran out.
[03:21:04.678 --> 03:21:09.440]  Free shipping at the InfoWars store.
[03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:09.840]  50% off.
[03:21:09.840 --> 03:21:19.985]  Survival Shield X2, Alpha Power, Secret 12, Super Mail Vitality as long as supplies last.
[03:21:19.985 --> 03:21:24.868]  So make sure that you do this and support the InfoWars at the same time.
[03:21:24.868 --> 03:21:25.568]  That's the deal.
[03:21:26.355 --> 03:21:28.516]  You get the products you want.
[03:21:28.516 --> 03:21:37.581]  InfoWars has the energy and capacity now to expand their operations and bring you the truth.
[03:21:37.581 --> 03:21:42.103]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:21:42.103 --> 03:21:44.484]  Well, here's the story.
[03:21:47.407 --> 03:22:05.677]  I would say maybe three out of ten times when I'm on with Alex and it's time for me to switch into gear and take over in the fourth hour, I just chuck everything and continue to talk about what Alex and I were talking about.
[03:22:05.677 --> 03:22:07.718]  That's the way it goes, folks.
[03:22:07.718 --> 03:22:12.781]  So here's my stories that I was going to talk about.
[03:22:12.781 --> 03:22:13.401]  Bye bye.
[03:22:13.401 --> 03:22:16.503]  And I'm going to talk about vaccines because
[03:22:17.483 --> 03:22:20.285]  This is chemical warfare against the population.
[03:22:20.285 --> 03:22:24.568]  I've been writing about this and talking about it since 1987.
[03:22:24.568 --> 03:22:26.129]  There's no end in sight.
[03:22:26.129 --> 03:22:28.451]  Not going to stop now.
[03:22:28.451 --> 03:22:33.535]  There's lots of vectors to approach this with.
[03:22:33.535 --> 03:22:37.097]  Lots of myths and fairy tales to explode.
[03:22:37.097 --> 03:22:38.739]  But I want to start with this.
[03:22:38.739 --> 03:22:41.921]  In Australia, what was it now?
[03:22:41.921 --> 03:22:43.142]  A year ago?
[03:22:44.341 --> 03:22:51.862]  Vaxxed, the documentary called Vaxxed, went to Australia with its producers.
[03:22:51.862 --> 03:23:10.366]  This is a very tight, chilling film about a CDC whistleblower named William Thompson, who admits that he and his colleagues at the CDC cheated, lied on a study, a scientific study of the MMR vaccine.
[03:23:12.285 --> 03:23:17.670]  And said that the vaccine had no connection to autism when in fact it did.
[03:23:17.670 --> 03:23:35.367]  That's a public confession he made, a long time CDC researcher, on his whistleblower lawyers webpage, Rick Morgan of Cincinnati and the CDC whistleblower William Thompson.
[03:23:35.367 --> 03:23:37.269]  The story of course, you know,
[03:23:38.001 --> 03:23:43.863]  Sort of surfaced in the mainstream and then, oh no, it couldn't be true, and then it went away.
[03:23:43.863 --> 03:23:52.667]  But, several very smart and brave people made a film, a documentary, about this called Vaxxed.
[03:23:52.667 --> 03:23:58.389]  Swept the nation, went abroad, still going abroad, and when it went to Australia,
[03:24:00.305 --> 03:24:07.651]  People lined up around the block to see it because the press said that it was horrible and nobody should see it.
[03:24:07.651 --> 03:24:11.194]  Nobody should look at it because it was too dangerous.
[03:24:11.194 --> 03:24:17.739]  This is your mainstream press, you know, idiots on parade.
[03:24:17.739 --> 03:24:27.047]  Well, one of the producers, Polly Tommy, had her visa yanked so that she couldn't come back to Australia.
[03:24:27.047 --> 03:24:29.829]  She was told when she left, can't come back.
[03:24:30.433 --> 03:24:32.435]  Visa is taken away, suspended.
[03:24:32.435 --> 03:24:34.337]  We don't want you here.
[03:24:34.337 --> 03:24:49.191]  And one of the big reasons why was as they were taking the film around the country, they began interviewing mothers of children that had their brains damaged and destroyed by vaccines.
[03:24:49.191 --> 03:24:51.774]  The stories were right out there firsthand.
[03:24:52.532 --> 03:24:59.233]  You didn't have to go through the New York Times to get their debunking and their experts.
[03:24:59.233 --> 03:25:02.834]  It was right there, right there in your face.
[03:25:02.834 --> 03:25:20.457]  And even worse, Polly said, what really started the ball rolling is when they interviewed mothers of children who had never been vaccinated and who had been healthy from the beginning and remained healthy.
[03:25:22.003 --> 03:25:26.905]  That, as far as the government and the press over there was concerned, was even worse.
[03:25:26.905 --> 03:25:30.326]  That was like a silver bullet to a werewolf.
[03:25:30.326 --> 03:25:36.607]  Oh my God, we can't... We can't let people know the truth.
[03:25:36.607 --> 03:25:49.571]  That if you raise kids the right way, and raise them healthy and strong, they're going to stay strong.
[03:25:49.571 --> 03:25:51.652]  Then we come to this thing called the herd effect.
[03:25:52.256 --> 03:25:58.081]  You know, this is the thing that drives people to surrender their children to the state.
[03:25:58.081 --> 03:26:11.173]  You have to vaccinate your child, because if you don't vaccinate him, he's going to be a little time bomb running around, and he could vaccinate, uh, infect my child with whatever diseases he has, and my child, of course, has been vaccinated.
[03:26:11.173 --> 03:26:17.198]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, let's break that down, ma'am.
[03:26:18.704 --> 03:26:31.850]  In other words, you're saying that your child who is vaccinated and therefore protected, protected, hmm, has no problem.
[03:26:31.850 --> 03:26:36.272]  Unless my child gets near your child.
[03:26:36.272 --> 03:26:39.474]  But your child is protected because your child's been vaccinated.
[03:26:39.474 --> 03:26:42.075]  So what's going on here?
[03:26:42.075 --> 03:26:42.555]  Right?
[03:26:42.555 --> 03:26:43.776]  I mean, unless you think
[03:26:45.054 --> 03:26:48.717]  That you've been hoaxed and you shouldn't have vaccinated your child?
[03:26:48.717 --> 03:26:51.079]  Your child's protected, vaccinated.
[03:26:51.079 --> 03:26:56.244]  My child didn't get vaccinated and he's a threat to your little baby?
[03:26:56.244 --> 03:26:57.925]  I don't think so.
[03:26:57.925 --> 03:27:02.629]  Otherwise, why get your child vaccinated?
[03:27:02.629 --> 03:27:04.491]  So much for the herd effect.
[03:27:04.491 --> 03:27:10.977]  This is the biggest pile of BS I've ever heard and this is what's used to drive parents to become
[03:27:11.975 --> 03:27:19.220]  Useful idiots in the war to force parents to vaccinate their children.
[03:27:19.220 --> 03:27:20.821]  Your little boy hasn't vaccinated?
[03:27:20.821 --> 03:27:24.824]  Well, now he is exiled from the community, right?
[03:27:24.824 --> 03:27:33.809]  Excommunicated from the holy order of biological mysticism that requires everybody to get vaccinated.
[03:27:33.809 --> 03:27:35.991]  Well, no, I raised my child healthy.
[03:27:36.733 --> 03:27:42.777]  He's healthy and strong, never been vaccinated, never had a problem, good nutrition, exercise and so on.
[03:27:42.777 --> 03:27:44.959]  What's the problem here?
[03:27:44.959 --> 03:27:46.420]  We can't let that story get out.
[03:27:46.420 --> 03:27:47.220]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:27:47.220 --> 03:27:48.101]  That's not a story.
[03:27:48.101 --> 03:27:48.862]  Don't cover that.
[03:27:48.862 --> 03:27:50.463]  Don't say that.
[03:27:50.463 --> 03:27:52.544]  Hide that from everybody.
[03:27:52.544 --> 03:28:03.392]  And hide the fact that in these vaccines, all of them, there are toxic chemicals that are injected directly into the body.
[03:28:04.441 --> 03:28:16.707]  That bypass the normal channels of body defenses, like mercury, which is still in certain flu vaccines, a heavy, heavy neurotoxin.
[03:28:16.707 --> 03:28:24.971]  Aluminum, which is in many, many, many, most vaccines, I would say, which is a heavy, heavy neurotoxin.
[03:28:24.971 --> 03:28:31.334]  Formaldehyde and polysorbate 80, you can go down the list.
[03:28:31.334 --> 03:28:31.834]  Look it up.
[03:28:32.469 --> 03:28:37.094]  Go to the CDC website and you'll find a list of ingredients.
[03:28:37.094 --> 03:28:38.875]  More to say on vaccines.
[03:28:38.875 --> 03:28:42.098]  We'll be back after this.
[03:28:42.098 --> 03:28:46.963]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:28:46.963 --> 03:28:48.425]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:28:52.233 --> 03:28:57.355]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:28:57.355 --> 03:29:03.058]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[03:29:03.058 --> 03:29:08.261]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[03:29:08.261 --> 03:29:10.202]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[03:29:10.202 --> 03:29:12.583]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[03:29:12.583 --> 03:29:13.543]  See guidelines.
[03:29:13.543 --> 03:29:16.825]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[03:29:16.825 --> 03:29:18.766]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.

[03:29:22.096 --> 03:29:23.017]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:29:23.017 --> 03:29:25.419]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:29:25.419 --> 03:29:33.545]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[03:29:33.545 --> 03:29:35.486]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[03:29:35.486 --> 03:29:39.189]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[03:29:48.376 --> 03:29:49.017]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:29:53.277 --> 03:29:56.258]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[03:29:56.258 --> 03:30:05.380]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[03:30:05.380 --> 03:30:06.740]  So what do we do about it?
[03:30:06.740 --> 03:30:10.081]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[03:30:10.081 --> 03:30:16.182]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush
[03:30:16.562 --> 03:30:17.842]  Without the crash.
[03:30:17.842 --> 03:30:24.084]  RainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[03:30:24.084 --> 03:30:30.006]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extracts.
[03:30:30.006 --> 03:30:32.007]  It gives you an added kick.

[03:30:45.576 --> 03:30:46.877]  It's the real deal.

[03:30:53.181 --> 03:31:00.726]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that

[03:34:16.618 --> 03:34:20.480]  Where else do we go with vaccines?
[03:34:20.480 --> 03:34:23.782]  Here's a place we can go.
[03:34:23.782 --> 03:34:26.283]  Babies.
[03:34:26.283 --> 03:34:28.345]  First day of life.
[03:34:28.345 --> 03:34:30.586]  Hepatitis B vaccine.
[03:34:30.586 --> 03:34:32.387]  What?
[03:34:32.387 --> 03:34:33.508]  This is a vaccine
[03:34:34.668 --> 03:34:52.823]  Supposedly protects people who share needles, IV drug users, prostitutes, sexually transmitted disease, and so on and so forth, given to babies on the first day of life.
[03:34:52.823 --> 03:34:59.589]  Other vaccines quickly follow many in the first months of life.
[03:34:59.589 --> 03:35:03.372]  Well, it's universally acknowledged
[03:35:04.349 --> 03:35:07.051]  And pay attention to this.
[03:35:07.051 --> 03:35:12.174]  That babies do not have anywhere near fully formed immune systems.
[03:35:12.174 --> 03:35:14.875]  They just don't.
[03:35:14.875 --> 03:35:16.997]  Not even close.
[03:35:16.997 --> 03:35:32.886]  Well, supposedly, the theory behind vaccination is that it stimulates a person's immune system to provide a kind of rehearsal for infection when the real thing comes along.
[03:35:34.637 --> 03:35:47.386]  If that were the case, you would have to have an immune system intact in order for this rehearsal to take place, which babies do not have.
[03:35:47.386 --> 03:35:54.811]  So from that point of view, purely, the entire thing is a gigantic hoax.
[03:35:54.811 --> 03:35:58.634]  A gigantic hoax.
[03:35:58.634 --> 03:36:03.437]  And should be not only investigated, but prosecuted that way.
[03:36:04.142 --> 03:36:07.544]  From the ground up.
[03:36:07.544 --> 03:36:14.548]  Let's take another factor, supposedly, about vaccines.
[03:36:14.548 --> 03:36:23.513]  A person's immune system is suddenly said not to be able to function on its own when it's there and intact.
[03:36:23.513 --> 03:36:24.534]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:36:24.534 --> 03:36:28.976]  Can't, can't fight against disease.
[03:36:28.976 --> 03:36:31.558]  In order for that to happen, you have to be vaccinated.
[03:36:32.615 --> 03:36:50.122]  So that it stimulates the immune system with a kind of a teaser of what a real disease would be like so that later on, if the real thing happens, the immune system soldiers are on guard and they say, oh yes, I can see it from a mile away and here we go.
[03:36:50.122 --> 03:36:55.784]  What kind of sense does that make when you really stop and think about it?
[03:36:55.784 --> 03:36:58.905]  What kind of sense does that make at all?
[03:36:58.905 --> 03:36:59.225]  None.
[03:36:59.225 --> 03:36:59.946]  Zero.
[03:37:01.647 --> 03:37:05.310]  Now here's what a vaccine can do.
[03:37:05.310 --> 03:37:18.260]  It can weaken the immune system such that the immune system can't really respond fully when a real infection comes down the pipeline.
[03:37:18.260 --> 03:37:26.766]  And when that is the case, you will not see the familiar rashes and other symptoms of the infection at all.
[03:37:27.583 --> 03:37:38.734]  Because the immune system is too weak to mount a full acute inflammatory response, which is what the immune system ought to be doing.
[03:37:38.734 --> 03:37:41.356]  That's why you see the rashes.
[03:37:41.356 --> 03:37:44.019]  That's why the fever occurs and so on.
[03:37:44.019 --> 03:37:46.782]  That is a combination of an infection.
[03:37:47.641 --> 03:37:54.508]  And the immune system mounting a full and bold and full-bodied immune response.
[03:37:54.508 --> 03:38:06.339]  Well, if vaccines with their toxic elements and so forth have reduced the ability of the immune system to respond, you don't see those symptoms.
[03:38:06.339 --> 03:38:07.660]  And why am I saying this?
[03:38:07.660 --> 03:38:08.942]  And why is it important?
[03:38:08.942 --> 03:38:11.264]  Because it forms the basis
[03:38:12.825 --> 03:38:17.809]  Of the medical cartel saying we have wiped out many diseases with vaccines.
[03:38:17.809 --> 03:38:18.190]  Why?
[03:38:18.190 --> 03:38:21.092]  Because we don't see the symptoms.
[03:38:21.092 --> 03:38:22.273]  Get it?
[03:38:22.273 --> 03:38:25.255]  We don't see the symptoms.
[03:38:25.255 --> 03:38:29.539]  Therefore, we know that the disease has been wiped out.
[03:38:29.539 --> 03:38:38.106]  False, wrong, incompetent, liars.
[03:38:38.106 --> 03:38:41.669]  If the immune system is weakened enough through vaccination,
[03:38:42.387 --> 03:38:50.212]  It will not be able to produce those symptoms that are supposedly signs of the disease.
[03:38:50.212 --> 03:38:58.938]  That's what you've got to understand in all of this hoax about, oh, we've wiped out many diseases with vaccination.
[03:38:58.938 --> 03:39:04.662]  I've told this story before here, but I'm sure there are many new listeners now.
[03:39:04.662 --> 03:39:11.307]  For several decades,
[03:39:12.381 --> 03:39:19.405]  In Africa, there was a gigantic campaign to wipe out smallpox with a smallpox vaccine.
[03:39:19.405 --> 03:39:24.047]  About a hundred million people received the vaccine.
[03:39:24.047 --> 03:39:28.190]  This was a World Health Organization program.
[03:39:28.190 --> 03:39:38.235]  Lasted 1966 to 1980, at which time the World Health Organization said, this is the greatest thing that's ever happened in medical history.
[03:39:38.235 --> 03:39:39.796]  We've wiped out smallpox.
[03:39:42.190 --> 03:39:43.050]  Really?
[03:39:43.050 --> 03:39:44.831]  Really?
[03:39:44.831 --> 03:40:08.139]  Because there's a warning that any competent doctor will give you about the smallpox vaccine in particular, which is, do not give it to people whose immune systems are already compromised and weak because then the vaccine can cause smallpox or devastate and kill the recipient by other means.
[03:40:10.325 --> 03:40:19.446]  So what the hell is the World Health Organization doing giving a hundred million shots of the smallpox vaccine across Africa?
[03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:41.167]  To millions and millions and millions of people whose immune systems were already compromised and weakened by generation to generation hunger and starvation, protein calorie malnutrition, contaminated water supplies, extreme grinding poverty, etc.
[03:40:41.167 --> 03:40:44.749]  overcrowding.
[03:40:44.749 --> 03:40:46.009]  What was going on there?
[03:40:46.009 --> 03:40:47.970]  Well, I found out what was going on there.
[03:40:49.261 --> 03:40:56.986]  Because I had a source, who was a very good mainstream source, who told me the following.
[03:40:56.986 --> 03:41:17.079]  While the champagne corks were popping in 1980, and the World Health Organization was saying, we just wiped out smallpox on the African continent, they were holding a super secret meeting in Geneva, their headquarters, to discuss the smallpox vaccine they had been using.
[03:41:18.639 --> 03:41:25.164]  And they decided that they would never, ever use that vaccine again.
[03:41:25.164 --> 03:41:28.106]  And I said to my source, why?
[03:41:28.106 --> 03:41:43.898]  He said, because it caused cases of smallpox, caused cases of smallpox, as well as many other kinds of devastation to people.
[03:41:43.898 --> 03:41:45.039]  Neurological gut
[03:41:48.286 --> 03:41:56.208]  Intestinal death from the toxic vaccine.
[03:41:56.208 --> 03:41:58.149]  That was the secret.
[03:41:58.149 --> 03:42:13.193]  That was never supposed to be publicized because they were celebrating the fact that they had supposedly wiped out smallpox on the African continent.
[03:42:13.193 --> 03:42:14.393]  It's things like this
[03:42:16.890 --> 03:42:22.913]  That will turn you in the direction of really looking into what this is all about.
[03:42:22.913 --> 03:42:32.619]  Because what it's all about is chemical warfare against the population of the world in many, many ways.
[03:42:32.619 --> 03:42:36.101]  Many, many ways.
[03:42:36.101 --> 03:42:40.323]  There's more to tell, and I will tell it, and we'll be back on InfoWars after this break.
[03:42:52.156 --> 03:42:54.038]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:42:54.038 --> 03:42:55.279]  Go ahead.
[03:42:55.279 --> 03:42:57.220]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:42:57.220 --> 03:43:07.408]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:43:07.408 --> 03:43:11.071]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[03:43:11.551 --> 03:43:11.811]  Absolutely.
[03:43:34.305 --> 03:43:55.172]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:43:55.172 --> 03:43:59.873]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.

[03:44:07.063 --> 03:44:09.425]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:44:09.425 --> 03:44:11.187]  B vitamins we need every day.
[03:44:11.187 --> 03:44:16.473]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.

[03:44:26.264 --> 03:44:27.425]  Optimal absorption.
[03:44:27.425 --> 03:44:32.551]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[03:44:32.551 --> 03:44:37.656]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[03:44:37.656 --> 03:44:38.497]  Optimum levels.
[03:44:39.899 --> 03:44:44.067]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[03:46:56.196 --> 03:46:58.818]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.354 --> 03:47:12.436]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:47:12.436 --> 03:47:14.537]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:14.537 --> 03:47:21.180]  John Rappaport here.
[03:47:21.180 --> 03:47:27.263]  Last segment of this fourth hour sitting in for Alex at Infowars.
[03:47:27.263 --> 03:47:30.725]  So what's the overall agenda here?
[03:47:30.725 --> 03:47:34.567]  First of all, let's take this down to the ground.
[03:47:37.026 --> 03:47:42.607]  If a doctor said to a sane mother, look mom, this is what I propose to do.
[03:47:42.607 --> 03:47:48.628]  You see this sparkling little baby that you have here brimming with life that's so healthy?
[03:47:48.628 --> 03:47:55.149]  I want to inject this baby, inject now, with aluminum, okay?
[03:47:55.149 --> 03:48:03.771]  Which is a known neurotoxin, crosses the barrier into the brain, can just wreak havoc.
[03:48:03.771 --> 03:48:05.431]  Formaldehyde, another toxin.
[03:48:06.747 --> 03:48:12.812]  Polysorbate 80 and a bunch of other chemicals, you know, there's some antibiotics in there and so forth and so on.
[03:48:12.812 --> 03:48:15.534]  Just, you know, you can read the whole list of ingredients.
[03:48:15.534 --> 03:48:22.899]  They all have a certain amount of toxicity to the body, to life.
[03:48:22.899 --> 03:48:28.664]  And then a germ at the same time, that's really the heart of this, a virus you're going to put in there.
[03:48:30.074 --> 03:48:32.215]  That's supposed to stimulate your baby's immune system.
[03:48:32.215 --> 03:48:36.116]  Of course, your baby doesn't have an immune system yet to be stimulated, okay?
[03:48:36.116 --> 03:48:38.136]  So, this is what I want to do.
[03:48:38.136 --> 03:48:38.536]  Okay?
[03:48:38.536 --> 03:48:42.998]  Is that alright with you, Mom?
[03:48:42.998 --> 03:48:47.319]  That's what we're talking about here.
[03:48:47.319 --> 03:48:52.240]  Now, what's the overall agenda behind this?
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:48:54.321]  Well, I mean, it's evil.
[03:48:54.321 --> 03:48:58.102]  Evil is always... Doing evil is always an agenda for some people.
[03:49:00.407 --> 03:49:26.108]  But, what we call globalism, which is global tyranny, an attempt to remake the planet with no individual countries, just the country called Earth, under the control of an elite management system of oligarchs,
[03:49:27.054 --> 03:49:36.619]  Who decide how life is going to be lived on this planet by 8 billion, 10 billion people, whatever it is.
[03:49:36.619 --> 03:49:38.160]  That's their goal.
[03:49:38.160 --> 03:49:39.301]  That's what they're after.
[03:49:39.301 --> 03:49:51.068]  That's what they've been doing since 1945 and for a century before, at least as well, under guise of different names.
[03:49:51.068 --> 03:49:51.888]  They exist.
[03:49:51.888 --> 03:49:53.149]  They're real.
[03:49:53.149 --> 03:49:54.910]  It's not a fantasy, folks.
[03:49:57.461 --> 03:50:05.228]  It's a political war against the population.
[03:50:05.228 --> 03:50:18.579]  Now imagine that you were one of the elite leaders in that war and your ambition was to control 8 to 10 billion people.
[03:50:18.579 --> 03:50:19.780]  That's a pretty tall order.
[03:50:21.061 --> 03:50:28.045]  You know, I mean, that's not a simple thing that you can just snap your fingers and overnight, OK, we've done it, boys.
[03:50:28.045 --> 03:50:29.626]  No problem.
[03:50:29.626 --> 03:50:31.407]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:50:31.407 --> 03:50:34.108]  This is a long, protracted war.
[03:50:34.108 --> 03:50:38.591]  You want as many people as possible.
[03:50:38.591 --> 03:50:44.814]  To have lowered vitality, the juice of life and strength and power to resist.
[03:50:45.666 --> 03:50:50.268]  You want to drop their IQs as far as you possibly can.
[03:50:50.268 --> 03:50:58.410]  You want to disorient and confuse them and weaken them in every possible way on every possible level.
[03:50:58.410 --> 03:51:14.396]  You want to toxify their systems in some, not just today and tomorrow, but some chronic way over the decades and decades of a lifetime to reduce their ability to function.
[03:51:15.248 --> 03:51:25.357]  Without becoming completely dependent upon the state, which means you, the globalist master.
[03:51:25.357 --> 03:51:26.998]  That's what you want.
[03:51:26.998 --> 03:51:28.019]  That's what you need.
[03:51:28.019 --> 03:51:35.866]  That's what you've got to have if you have a prayer of bringing the whole planet under your control.
[03:51:35.866 --> 03:51:38.228]  Let's face it.
[03:51:38.228 --> 03:51:40.250]  That war is going to be fought
[03:51:41.247 --> 03:51:49.528]  Along several fronts, and it would be incredibly naive of anyone to think differently.
[03:51:49.528 --> 03:51:53.789]  And one of those fronts happens to be medical.
[03:51:53.789 --> 03:51:58.750]  And one of those medical fronts happens to be vaccination.
[03:51:58.750 --> 03:52:10.892]  Which, if you look at the literature since the beginning in England, and really read it, you're going to see one thing that stands out.
[03:52:12.288 --> 03:52:12.848]  They knew.
[03:52:12.848 --> 03:52:16.349]  They know now.
[03:52:16.349 --> 03:52:20.611]  They knew then, they know now, that it's toxic.
[03:52:20.611 --> 03:52:28.633]  They knew then, they know now, and they admit it in the literature that it's toxic.
[03:52:28.633 --> 03:52:30.174]  They don't care.
[03:52:30.174 --> 03:52:33.695]  They rationalize it away through a number of means.
[03:52:33.695 --> 03:52:36.416]  They are the useful idiots, right?
[03:52:37.040 --> 03:52:45.522]  They could have 150 IQ and sit in a doctor's office, they're still a useful idiot.
[03:52:45.522 --> 03:53:01.806]  The people on top, the Rockefeller syndicate for example, which is one of the arch forces of globalism and has been for a very long time, they know what they're doing.
[03:53:01.806 --> 03:53:02.786]  They understand
[03:53:03.712 --> 03:53:05.633]  The wise and the wherefores.
[03:53:05.633 --> 03:53:06.674]  And they always have.
[03:53:06.674 --> 03:53:10.997]  And it isn't just money, money, money.
[03:53:10.997 --> 03:53:22.106]  Any major operation, I mean, in this case, a global operation, has levels of agenda.
[03:53:22.106 --> 03:53:29.351]  Money, profits, individuals want promotion, status, paycheck, survival, recognition.
[03:53:32.017 --> 03:53:37.898]  But you get higher and higher and you see that it's about power, control and destruction.
[03:53:37.898 --> 03:53:39.698]  That's what this is about.
[03:53:39.698 --> 03:53:57.562]  And when you see in the light of day, the topmost agenda of the vaccination program that has existed on this planet and keeps expanding, well over 200 vaccines are now in the research pipeline.
[03:53:57.562 --> 03:53:58.122]  In addition,
[03:53:58.763 --> 03:54:13.634]  To the dozens of vaccines that are now on the CDC schedule to be taken by children and they're coming after the adults in case you thought you were exempt.
[03:54:13.634 --> 03:54:16.176]  Over 200 in the research pipeline.
[03:54:16.176 --> 03:54:24.121]  It's endless, folks, because it means more and more poisoning and destruction.
[03:54:24.121 --> 03:54:24.902]  That's what it means.
[03:54:26.952 --> 03:54:35.438]  This is not the kind of chemical warfare that you see dropped from planes or sprayed on the ground all around.
[03:54:35.438 --> 03:54:47.125]  This is the kind of chemical warfare that is carried out very soberly and rationally and with all sorts of official justification.
[03:54:47.125 --> 03:54:50.127]  We're here to do good.
[03:54:50.127 --> 03:54:51.568]  We're here to help you.
[03:54:51.568 --> 03:54:55.511]  We're here to bring a better world about.
[03:54:56.718 --> 03:54:59.702]  This is the kind of propaganda that has an effect.
[03:54:59.702 --> 03:55:01.003]  These people are professionals.
[03:55:01.003 --> 03:55:03.646]  They're not idiots when it comes to propaganda.
[03:55:03.646 --> 03:55:06.950]  They know how to do it, and that's what they're doing.
[03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:08.853]  And that's the point of what they're doing.
[03:55:08.853 --> 03:55:15.641]  At the highest levels, where only a few live, the rest
[03:55:17.006 --> 03:55:26.316]  Partake of the conspiracy because they see some advantage for themselves and they don't see the bigger picture.
[03:55:26.316 --> 03:55:28.798]  That's how you do a conspiracy.
[03:55:28.798 --> 03:55:32.582]  Oh, you can't do a conspiracy because too many people would have to be in on it.
[03:55:33.419 --> 03:55:38.882]  Those are the idiots talking that don't understand how covert ops are arranged.
[03:55:38.882 --> 03:55:41.083]  They're compartmentalized.
[03:55:41.083 --> 03:55:50.627]  The people at the lower levels have only a glimpse of what's really happening, and they have a reason within them to do what they're told to do.
[03:55:50.627 --> 03:55:58.271]  Whether it's following orders, a paycheck, survival, status, promotion, whatever it is, they do it.
[03:55:59.705 --> 03:56:04.907]  And when you add up all the useful idiots, you get the big picture.
[03:56:04.907 --> 03:56:07.728]  And it's true with vaccination and vaccines.
[03:56:07.728 --> 03:56:12.709]  At the highest level, the people know what they're doing.
[03:56:12.709 --> 03:56:25.014]  They're doing chemical warfare in order to weaken the global population and make the takeover of the planet that much easier.
[03:56:25.014 --> 03:56:28.235]  And in fact, possible.
[03:56:28.235 --> 03:56:29.015]  Without that,
[03:56:29.665 --> 03:56:34.826]  Without the medical cartel, it would be far, far more difficult.
[03:56:34.826 --> 03:56:53.430]  If you had a global population mainly composed of extremely healthy, vital people, aware, alert, educated, independent, powerful, creative,
[03:56:56.340 --> 03:57:04.727]  This operation would have fallen into decay and dust a long time ago.
[03:57:04.727 --> 03:57:15.275]  The vaccinators who are the poisoners have reversed that trend successfully and they've managed to blame all the poisoning effects on other things.
[03:57:15.275 --> 03:57:16.896]  That's their job.
[03:57:16.896 --> 03:57:17.897]  We didn't do that.
[03:57:18.792 --> 03:57:26.800]  Yeah, the baby just folded up and has now brain damage for the rest of his life just after the vaccination, but it has nothing to do with the vaccination.
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:31.465]  It's just some genetic thing kicked in.
[03:57:31.465 --> 03:57:35.049]  Believe that, if you will, or believe the truth.
[03:57:35.049 --> 03:57:38.673]  See you next time, on Infinite.
[03:57:42.142 --> 03:57:48.126]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[03:57:48.126 --> 03:57:52.269]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:57:52.269 --> 03:57:58.533]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:58:00.294 --> 03:58:07.457]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
