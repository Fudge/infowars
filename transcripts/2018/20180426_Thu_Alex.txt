[00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:20.637]  Coming to you from the former United States of America from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:00:20.977 --> 00:00:22.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.812]  Well, we've got a very special broadcast for you lined up today.
[00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:54.111]  We're going to have Ben Garrison, the most prolific popular political cartoonist of the last decade, in studio, along with the most prolific, dangerous-to-the-establishment street artist, Sabo, both in studio, because his censorship massively intensifies online against libertarians, nationalists, populists, conservatives, and just free thinkers, period.
[00:00:56.325 --> 00:01:02.231]  We have to hit the streets now, everybody, myself included, with street art.
[00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:03.793]  And that means...
[00:01:05.103 --> 00:01:14.005]  I want to develop a plan to try to have art that people can print off in HD for free, print off at Kinko's, print off on their own printer, and then put up around town.
[00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:26.968]  Or we can post other people's activist art, but then also have a plan to then sell nice prints of the art to support the artist, and then hang that up in your shops, your businesses, as kind of free-thinking outpost.
[00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:31.809]  So they're going to be with us in studio coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.049]  Sabo of Unsavory
[00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.029]  Let's put that back up on screen.
[00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:40.751]  Acebo of Unsavory Agents and, of course, Ben Garrison of Ben Garrison Graphics.
[00:01:43.072 --> 00:01:44.132]  So that is going to be in studio.
[00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:45.272]  Very, very excited about that.
[00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:46.493]  They're here until Saturday.
[00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:48.153]  I want to go out and shoot some videos with them on the street.
[00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:57.616]  I want to talk about some plans, not to even centralize something, but just to try to really sell the public on this being the next level of resistance, which it clearly is.
[00:01:57.636 --> 00:02:02.237]  We've got to fight for web freedom, fight to break up the monopolies, fight online harder than ever.
[00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:07.077]  But we've got to expand out everywhere else we can as well onto the actual streets.
[00:02:07.097 --> 00:02:08.158]  The globals are so scared of that.
[00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.322]  Okay, that said, let's just go through these headlines.
[00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:18.007]  Judge bars conservatives from any business they want.
[00:02:18.047 --> 00:02:19.007]  That's basically what's happening.
[00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:22.050]  Judge bars are allowed to throw out Trump supporters.
[00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:28.756]  White House Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws as Trump nominee to head the Veterans Affairs Department.
[00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:33.184]  We had the number one story in the country yesterday on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:35.586]  Kanye doubles down.
[00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:38.008]  Mob can't make me not love Trump.
[00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:40.129]  We're gonna get into that.
[00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.052]  500 million Africans could invade Europe under ISIS plan.
[00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:46.514]  Dan Lyman for InfoWars Europe.
[00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:48.996]  That's at NewsWars.com.
[00:02:49.777 --> 00:02:50.938]  And this ties into The Guardian.
[00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:54.701]  ISIS trying to foment a wave of migrants to Europe, says UN official.
[00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:56.382]  But the UN's working with them.
[00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:57.864]  The rest of the story's coming up.
[00:02:59.124 --> 00:03:00.165]  Just like the same U.N.
[00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:11.193]  refugee program with George Soros is a honchoing, quarterbacking, commanding, Central American asylum-seeking caravan set to arrive in California by Friday.
[00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.491]  Bloodbath in Cancun.
[00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:15.112]  Five dead.
[00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:16.032]  It's almost every day now.
[00:03:16.052 --> 00:03:17.052]  I like Cancun.
[00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.153]  Too bad you really can't go there now.
[00:03:18.173 --> 00:03:18.713]  It's too dangerous.
[00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:24.395]  Are found in car at the vacation hotspot, a drug cartel, or spills on the beaches of the Mexican resort town.
[00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:25.895]  And it gets worse than that.
[00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:32.677]  They're having deaths every week now in that area, and many other areas of Mexico for that matter, where they drug you.
[00:03:33.177 --> 00:03:40.059]  So they can rob you, but, you know, they drug your drink, but then it ends up killing a lot of people, including children.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.420]  They just drug the whole family.
[00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:43.121]  Very, very sad.
[00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:48.723]  German police invited to erotic bondage session after responding to a complaint are invited to join in.
[00:03:49.364 --> 00:03:50.644]  That's DW.com.
[00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:52.265]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:57.447]  A 74-year-old Swedish woman prosecuted for criticizing mass migration.
[00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:58.987]  That ties in to how the U.N.
[00:03:59.047 --> 00:04:00.388]  is allied with the Islamicist.
[00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:04.209]  Pig brains are kept alive without a body for the first time, we're told.
[00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.190]  It's all 30-year-old technology.
[00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.972]  And there are implanted human brains in pigs, pig brains in human bodies, and of course human brains in mice.
[00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:20.713]  And they're creating human-animal hybrids for 30-plus years in the literature, but they don't want you to know that until the last month.
[00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:21.815]  Suddenly they're announcing it everywhere.
[00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:25.199]  But I don't get any calls saying, oh, we're sorry, Alex.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.981]  You told everybody this first.
[00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:28.443]  No, they just say, no, you're dangerous.
[00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:29.865]  You'll be taken off air.
[00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:34.308]  Macron says he thinks Trump will pull out of Iran nuclear deal.
[00:04:34.768 --> 00:04:36.129]  And I think the evidence is there.
[00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.371]  The supreme Iranian dictator threatens Trump.
[00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:41.712]  And Iran's naval commander threatens to sink U.S.
[00:04:41.772 --> 00:04:44.674]  ships, create catastrophic situation if Trump kills the deal.
[00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:48.467]  Iran is out of control.
[00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:51.191]  We will return on the other side.
[00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:56.899]  University offers cry closets for stressed out snowflakes with stuffed animals inside.
[00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.260]  Yes, I'm not joking.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.624]  They're teaching mental illness and arrested development.
[00:05:00.944 --> 00:05:01.645]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:02.086]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.162]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:09.657 --> 00:06:19.960]  I mean, there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:29.823]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[00:06:29.843 --> 00:06:30.063]  Scum!
[00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:34.404]  Russian scum!
[00:06:38.738 --> 00:06:39.818]  Until Morris comes to mind.
[00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:45.380]  Your reputation's amazing.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.120]  I will not let you down.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.181]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:06:55.622 --> 00:06:57.062]  Okay, last time.
[00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:58.903]  This is cell phone radiation.
[00:06:59.323 --> 00:07:02.484]  This is your brain on cell phone and wireless radiation.
[00:07:03.264 --> 00:07:03.864]  Any questions?
[00:07:05.077 --> 00:07:11.382]  This message is brought to you by Infowars.com in the hopes that if you're going to fry your brain and body with radiation, that's for business.
[00:07:11.642 --> 00:07:13.724]  But for God's sake, let's protect our children.
[00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:27.695]  The United States tested a powerful ICBM, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, ahead of negotiations for Trump's meeting with Kim Jong-un.
[00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:43.668]  The president of South Korea is set to meet in the next week with the dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, as well, showing major signs that we're going to get a huge, real peace deal and an end to the Korean War after 60-plus years.
[00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:45.330]  So that is a big deal.
[00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.491]  Let's pray for that.
[00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:50.655]  The Iranian dictator, supreme leader,
[00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:55.755]  Rouhani insults Trump as Iran nuclear deal hangs in the balance.
[00:07:56.656 --> 00:07:59.478]  Meanwhile, Iranian naval commander threatens to sink U.S.
[00:07:59.498 --> 00:08:02.981]  ships to create catastrophic situation if Trump kills deal.
[00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:07.324]  That video and the article is up on Infowars.com.
[00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:11.287]  But again, South Korea's Moon set to meet North Korea's Kim at border summit.
[00:08:11.327 --> 00:08:12.328]  That is good news.
[00:08:12.928 --> 00:08:17.612]  With all that other bad news, Iran is completely out of control.
[00:08:19.326 --> 00:08:29.273]  I don't want a war with Iran, but their behavior, their rhetoric, what they do to our ships there in the Persian Gulf is really asking for it.
[00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:36.999]  They're asking for another Operation Praying Mantis when their whole major fleet got blown up.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.182]  All their ships that could be blue water went to the bottom.
[00:08:41.882 --> 00:08:44.144]  Operation Praying Mantis.
[00:08:44.744 --> 00:08:45.745]  So they're looking for that.
[00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:48.227]  They might be looking in the right spot.
[00:08:49.906 --> 00:08:50.787]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:08:51.887 --> 00:08:54.209]  We've got important things going on here in America.
[00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:59.333]  Judge says businesses are allowed to throw out Trump supporters.
[00:09:00.153 --> 00:09:03.936]  They said there's no protection for political views.
[00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:10.060]  Now, if you're a gay couple and somebody doesn't want to bake your cake, well, you shouldn't just go somewhere else.
[00:09:12.822 --> 00:09:13.423]  No, you should get $500,000.
[00:09:13.463 --> 00:09:13.823]  But if you're a
[00:09:19.636 --> 00:09:20.416]  Conservative?
[00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:23.578]  Well, there's no protections on politics.
[00:09:23.738 --> 00:09:24.018]  Really?
[00:09:24.038 --> 00:09:27.119]  Hmm, okay.
[00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:44.766]  And that's how political correctness works, is that you've got all these protected groups that are, quote, protected, so you can turn them into a victim mentality and get them in your little cult with the supposed fringe benefits of being in a group.
[00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:51.674]  But if you're a white male or a white gay guy or whatever, well, you need not apply.
[00:09:51.734 --> 00:10:07.148]  Just like Milo in that bar over the weekend, a gay libertarian conservative who's Jewish and has nothing to do with Nazis, except leftist groups were reportedly paid to have people howl Hitler and stuff and get that on tape, and that's admitted trolling.
[00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.571]  Or troll groups have trolled him.
[00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.237]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:13.277 --> 00:10:13.877]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:13.897 --> 00:10:15.297]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:15.358 --> 00:10:15.998]  Nazis scum get out!

[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.320]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:22.961]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:23.741]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:24.321 --> 00:10:25.161]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:25.602]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:25.622 --> 00:10:26.202]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:26.222 --> 00:10:26.922]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:27.362 --> 00:10:27.923]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:27.943 --> 00:10:28.463]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:28.483 --> 00:10:28.963]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:29.463]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:29.483 --> 00:10:30.143]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:31.784]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:31.804 --> 00:10:32.664]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:33.145 --> 00:10:33.585]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:33.605 --> 00:10:34.025]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:34.045 --> 00:10:34.405]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:35.326]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:35.346 --> 00:10:35.886]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:36.586]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:36.606 --> 00:10:37.466]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:37.486 --> 00:10:38.007]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:38.027 --> 00:10:38.667]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:38.687 --> 00:10:39.247]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:39.267 --> 00:10:39.767]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:39.787 --> 00:10:40.648]  Nazis scum get out!
[00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:40.988]  Nazis sc
[00:10:42.113 --> 00:10:42.674]  In the 50s.
[00:10:43.214 --> 00:10:43.714]  Or the 40s.
[00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:45.816]  So authoritarian.
[00:10:46.197 --> 00:10:48.239]  The very Nazi-like behavior they're talking about.
[00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:50.601]  But let me just get back into the larger news here.
[00:10:51.642 --> 00:10:52.683]  We've got that article.
[00:10:53.584 --> 00:10:59.749]  White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, withdraws as Trump's nominee to head Veterans Affairs Department.
[00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:02.612]  He worked for Obama.
[00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:20.195]  For eight years in the White House, was friends with everybody, is nonpartisan, and then they had more than 20 Democrats go, without substantiation, claim he got drunk, had a fender bender with no evidence, and so he's had to step down from that.
[00:11:21.136 --> 00:11:25.681]  When Trump's friends with him, the guys have decorated combat medic,
[00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:28.590]  Who actually cares about the troops.
[00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:32.674]  We've had plenty of bureaucrats and plenty of hospital heads doing a horrible job.
[00:11:32.694 --> 00:11:48.548]  You know, the scandal is Obama let IBM have the Watson computers over the VA, with Secret Death List that came out six years ago, where the computers decided, just like they do at the National Health Service in England, who got health care and who didn't.
[00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:50.550]  Well, Trump's killed that.
[00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:58.697]  He's trying to fix it, but many VAs, even a year later, will not put up the President's photo.
[00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.478]  They're in total bureaucratic mutiny.
[00:12:03.218 --> 00:12:15.781]  And they make people wait for simple surgeries that are 100% operable, certain cancers, you name it, that are 100%, 98%, but you don't get the surgery because they don't feel like it.
[00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.452]  And they put you in a database of people not to treat.
[00:12:19.932 --> 00:12:20.573]  It's well known.
[00:12:21.454 --> 00:12:38.809]  And with the hack of the Office of Personnel Management files, 20 million veterans and intelligence operatives and their spouses and their connections, the left all over has access to that database and they punch into it and they decide.
[00:12:39.609 --> 00:12:42.512]  The Communist Chinese that run UT publicly, they have that database.
[00:12:43.302 --> 00:12:51.131]  And there's investigations going on they know full well about, they don't even care, where they run you through that database and they have your secret data and they decide.
[00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:56.438]  They've been given the keys to the entire NSA file on you and your family.
[00:12:56.978 --> 00:12:57.739]  If you're in the government.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.661]  How do you like that?
[00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:02.385]  That's total penetration!
[00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:09.148]  Trump is just death throes of this country, trying to battle back from final destruction.
[00:13:09.668 --> 00:13:12.731]  And all the programmed leftists and people are like, NO!
[00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:14.894]  AMERICA'S GOING DOWN!
[00:13:15.614 --> 00:13:16.916]  We hate flyover country!
[00:13:16.956 --> 00:13:18.057]  We hate bitter clingers!
[00:13:18.317 --> 00:13:19.478]  We hate capitalism!
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.162]  There's an excellent article if I have time to get into it.
[00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:41.614]  About how Coachella and all these big giant festivals are giant corporate brainwashing scams where people pose in front of signs like Hollywood in front of designer brands and people take photos of themselves imagining that they're celebrities and how everything is total corporate fascism.
[00:13:41.874 --> 00:13:47.696]  But the average millennial question there in a survey said, I'm a communist or a socialist, 53%.
[00:13:48.517 --> 00:13:49.677]  I don't like capitalism.
[00:13:50.037 --> 00:14:00.643]  When it is the most disgusting, twisted, consumerist, empty, mindless, hellish, 110 degrees, drug orgy.
[00:14:01.464 --> 00:14:05.846]  Spoiled brats in designer clothes pretending they're Hollywood stars.
[00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:11.690]  There's the headline, the online, the outline.
[00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.192]  Music festivals are the corporate dystopia we deserve.
[00:14:17.386 --> 00:14:33.382]  But they identify as communists with smartphones, $200 skinny jeans, doing the duck lips, doing selfies, and wearing gold chains, and taking molly, and having sex orgies.
[00:14:34.504 --> 00:14:36.125]  You think that's going on in North Korea?
[00:14:37.031 --> 00:14:40.175]  They execute homosexuals in China and North Korea.
[00:14:40.716 --> 00:14:44.261]  Oh, but you all wear mouse shirts and think it's sexy and cool.
[00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:45.302]  Idiots.
[00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:50.229]  Your little Islamic buddies throw you off roofs and cut your genitals off.
[00:14:50.529 --> 00:14:51.270]  But you like it.
[00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:55.112]  Because you think of it as millennials as getting back at daddy.
[00:14:55.632 --> 00:14:57.173]  Daddy worked 60 hours a week.
[00:14:57.693 --> 00:14:58.854]  Daddy played golf.
[00:14:59.314 --> 00:15:07.077]  Daddy was nice and spoiled you, and you're cucked now, and you want somebody like all these liberal women that are into bondage.
[00:15:07.097 --> 00:15:14.139]  Statistically, liberal women are three times more likely, I saw a study last week, to be into bondage, to be into being pimped.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.262]  They want a man to slap them, maybe loosen the teeth a bit, maybe give them a taste of blood in their mouth.
[00:15:20.982 --> 00:15:22.504]  They like their Islamic husbands.
[00:15:22.564 --> 00:15:22.945]  Oh, liberal.
[00:15:23.185 --> 00:15:24.527]  In fact, I forgot to cover it on Monday.
[00:15:24.947 --> 00:15:30.014]  Swedish women go to the refugee centers saying they want to prove they're not racist.
[00:15:30.635 --> 00:15:31.917]  The woman actually said this.
[00:15:32.337 --> 00:15:36.323]  The headline was, Swedish woman went to prove she wasn't racist, was anally gang-raped.
[00:15:36.623 --> 00:15:38.406]  And then she said, I'm still not mad at them.
[00:15:40.001 --> 00:15:40.401]  Oh, yes.
[00:15:40.662 --> 00:15:41.502]  Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:15:41.522 --> 00:15:42.483]  In fact, it was in Sweden.
[00:15:42.523 --> 00:15:43.264]  It was in Stockholm.
[00:15:43.824 --> 00:15:47.227]  Funny, it's Stockholm Syndrome in Stockholm, where they got its name.
[00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:48.969]  I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:49.810]  I'm digressing.
[00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.052]  It's all coming up today.
[00:15:53.293 --> 00:15:58.597]  And 500 million Africans are set to invade Europe under UN plan.
[00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:00.018]  Infowars.com.
[00:16:04.216 --> 00:16:22.505]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:28.208]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:29.569]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:30.009 --> 00:16:32.851]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:33.491 --> 00:16:34.472]  And so much more.
[00:16:35.032 --> 00:16:36.152]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:36.392 --> 00:16:38.093]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.113 --> 00:16:43.816]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:43.916 --> 00:16:45.117]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:47.077]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:49.539]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:50.999]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:53.000]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:54.141]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:55.581]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:55.702 --> 00:16:56.882]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:09.947]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:10.507]  You're on the air.
[00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:11.667]  Thanks for holding.
[00:17:11.707 --> 00:17:12.528]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:17:12.748 --> 00:17:13.348]  Hey, brother.
[00:17:13.668 --> 00:17:14.028]  Good, man.
[00:17:14.048 --> 00:17:14.848]  Thank you for calling.
[00:17:14.948 --> 00:17:15.508]  Hey, hey.
[00:17:15.588 --> 00:17:19.990]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:26.591]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:28.412]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:17:28.512 --> 00:17:34.794]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:17:35.814 --> 00:17:36.935]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:17:36.995 --> 00:17:39.437]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[00:17:39.497 --> 00:17:40.998]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:17:41.379 --> 00:17:42.980]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:44.201]  And exactly.
[00:17:44.221 --> 00:17:48.445]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:17:48.805 --> 00:17:49.085]  Boom!
[00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:52.048]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:17:52.108 --> 00:17:52.649]  It's amazing.
[00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:53.990]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.932]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:18:02.338 --> 00:18:03.699]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:05.280]  You can't survive without it.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.381]  But where do you get it?
[00:18:06.681 --> 00:18:12.446]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[00:19:05.001 --> 00:19:05.602]  For your support.
[00:19:05.883 --> 00:19:07.205]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[00:19:07.225 --> 00:19:08.929]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[00:19:09.209 --> 00:19:11.594]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:19:11.654 --> 00:19:12.575]  We've beaten six.
[00:19:12.876 --> 00:19:13.617]  But understand this.
[00:19:13.818 --> 00:19:14.840]  I am your soldier.
[00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:16.262]  You're my soldier.
[00:19:16.282 --> 00:19:17.024]  We're all in this together.
[00:19:18.052 --> 00:19:22.753]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.

[00:20:30.305 --> 00:20:31.506]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:47.635]  By the way, as we speak, Diamonds and Silk, or Diamond and Silk, to frequent guests of this broadcast, ladies that have reached hundreds of millions of people on YouTube alone, who helped get Trump elected, who are funny, who are smart, who are witty, but very sweet, very, very nice, very, very positive.
[00:20:48.575 --> 00:20:49.636]  Because, hey, we can even protect
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.081]  Unpositive or nasty speech.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:20:56.664]  An unpopular speech, but their speech was just two sweet, smart ladies.
[00:20:56.764 --> 00:20:57.484]  Two black ladies.
[00:20:58.785 --> 00:20:59.785]  They're on Capitol Hill.
[00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.106]  We can punch up YouTube if you want.
[00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:02.147]  It's got a live stream on it.
[00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:07.690]  Today, Congress investigates whether social media hates conservatives.
[00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.752]  The Verge is reporting.
[00:21:11.752 --> 00:21:13.333]  And what an interesting question.
[00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:17.136]  Today, Congress investigates, is the sky blue?
[00:21:17.917 --> 00:21:19.037]  Do ducks quack?
[00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:20.699]  Do babies cry?
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.782]  I mean, this is ra-donkulous.
[00:21:26.391 --> 00:21:27.611]  It is total war.
[00:21:27.951 --> 00:21:31.192]  The head of Twitter says, we have a revolution against conservatives.
[00:21:31.432 --> 00:21:32.272]  We're censoring them.
[00:21:32.472 --> 00:21:33.913]  We're going to destroy them.
[00:21:33.933 --> 00:21:34.453]  That's a quote.
[00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:41.814]  We have all the internal videos of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter saying, our main job is to stop Alex Jones.
[00:21:42.354 --> 00:21:48.576]  We have congressional hearings from four months ago with Congressman Quigley going, Paul Watson of Infowars was number one at lunch.
[00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:50.896]  They said, sir, we saw it and stopped it.
[00:21:51.816 --> 00:21:54.157]  The CEOs of Twitter, Facebook, and Google.
[00:21:55.467 --> 00:21:55.887]  Yes, sir!
[00:21:55.927 --> 00:21:56.607]  We saw it!
[00:21:56.887 --> 00:21:58.488]  We stopped him and it's fake news!
[00:21:58.808 --> 00:22:00.609]  It was that a Muslim did a truck attack!
[00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:01.509]  It was confirmed!
[00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:05.250]  We'll stop them from being number one, sir!
[00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:06.630]  Yes, sir!
[00:22:07.771 --> 00:22:15.353]  So now Congress is having hearings if bears go to the bathroom in the woods.
[00:22:15.713 --> 00:22:17.554]  In fact, McBrain made a little 10-second promo of that.
[00:22:17.614 --> 00:22:18.514]  I've never seen it on the show.
[00:22:18.534 --> 00:22:18.794]  Can we?
[00:22:19.314 --> 00:22:20.194]  I want to get McBrain's promo.
[00:22:20.234 --> 00:22:21.495]  I want to come back with that promo.
[00:22:21.975 --> 00:22:24.476]  It's just that it's a non-audible.
[00:22:24.536 --> 00:22:25.056]  It's video.
[00:22:26.331 --> 00:22:27.812]  It just talks about are Democrats tyrants?
[00:22:28.193 --> 00:22:33.918]  Well, do bears, you know, do Democrats try to steal elections and have dead people vote?
[00:22:33.938 --> 00:22:35.740]  Bears go potty in the woods.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.064]  But let's go to, let's go to the committee hearing right now with Diamond and Silk.
[00:22:41.104 --> 00:22:41.445]  Here it is.
[00:22:42.386 --> 00:22:45.689]  Being targeted and censored on social media platforms.
[00:22:46.513 --> 00:23:01.120]  Facebook along with other social media sites have taken aggressive actions to silence conservative voices such as ourselves by deliberately restricting and weaponizing our page with algorithms that censor and suppress our free speech.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:23.692]  These biased algorithms are tactics designed to pick up on key words, thus telling the pages how to behave in ways that repress and stifle express ideas, including shadowbanding, which block our content from being seen by our followers while depriving our brand through the demonetization of our videos.
[00:23:24.332 --> 00:23:28.993]  Followers stopped receiving notification when we posted videos and content.
[00:23:29.334 --> 00:23:32.655]  Followers was also mysteriously unlike from our page.
[00:23:33.395 --> 00:23:47.179]  Subtle and slowly, Facebook used one mechanism at a time to diminish our reach by restricting our page so that our 1.2 million followers would not see our content, thus silencing our conservative voices.
[00:23:47.979 --> 00:23:52.401]  When we reached out to Facebook for an explanation, they gave us the runaround.
[00:23:53.490 --> 00:24:03.297]  Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress and stated that the most important thing he cared about was making sure no one interferes in the 2018 elections.
[00:24:03.897 --> 00:24:20.888]  But after doing our research, we wondered if Mark Zuckerberg was using Facebook to interfere in the 2018 elections by labeling users' accounts as either liberal, very liberal, moderate, conservative... Well, he admitted he was for the Democrats.
[00:24:20.928 --> 00:24:21.669]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:24:24.251 --> 00:24:41.188]  So, if I'm labeled as very liberal without the option to edit it, update, and correct the settings, then algorithms are already put in place which allows advertisers... They label you just like the Nazis put the stars on Jews in pink.
[00:24:41.829 --> 00:24:42.729]  Triangles on gage.
[00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.890]  This is super dangerous, but they know that.
[00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:50.273]  You can search engine WikiLeaks, where Obama and Hillary go, we own Facebook.
[00:24:50.693 --> 00:24:51.553]  We own Twitter.
[00:24:52.173 --> 00:24:55.535]  Guys, gals, pull up the headline just two weeks ago.
[00:24:55.935 --> 00:25:00.497]  CEO of Twitter says we're going to have a revolution against conservatives and crush them.
[00:25:01.217 --> 00:25:06.540]  I mean, they're like declaring the war, and the conservatives are like, we think maybe they're doing this to us.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.420]  Keep going.
[00:25:11.937 --> 00:25:12.758]  Or Diamond Anselm.
[00:25:31.517 --> 00:25:36.481]  Diamond and Silk personal Facebook page has been labeled by Facebook as very liberal.
[00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:50.333]  Even though we are not very liberal, Facebook do not give us the option to change this label to conservative, making it less likely for us to see advertisement, news stories, and services for a conservative point of view.
[00:25:51.154 --> 00:25:56.698]  If Facebook labeled our user accounts as very liberal and got it wrong, how many more... Alright, that's good.
[00:25:56.718 --> 00:25:57.759]  We're going to come back to more of this.
[00:25:57.819 --> 00:25:58.240]  It's live.
[00:25:59.478 --> 00:26:00.359]  It's more sophisticated.
[00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:05.363]  It's part of the Chinese global system that's being adopted of the World Social Score.
[00:26:05.904 --> 00:26:08.106]  Where they just hit a button and you're banned from the web.
[00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:10.528]  It's called Internet ID.
[00:26:11.408 --> 00:26:14.351]  It's the holy grail of censorship and control.
[00:26:15.092 --> 00:26:20.136]  So we'll get into more of this and how it ties into NBC's failing bet on Megyn Kelly.
[00:26:20.556 --> 00:26:24.760]  Wall Street Journal, her ratings continue to plunge.
[00:26:26.257 --> 00:26:31.518]  Continue to fall because people know she's a fraud and they're sick of her.
[00:26:32.938 --> 00:26:44.601]  Meanwhile they have a new hatred of journalism index being reported on and of course Acosta of CNN talked about it's so dangerous Trump's gonna get people killed attacking free speech.
[00:26:44.661 --> 00:26:48.562]  Now seeing fake journalists like Jim Acosta and Megyn Kelly
[00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:50.931]  Are frauds.
[00:26:51.852 --> 00:26:55.774]  Saying that they're full of lies and disinfo is not attacking the press.
[00:26:55.814 --> 00:26:57.454]  It's saying, you are a liar.
[00:26:57.534 --> 00:26:58.515]  You're attacking us.
[00:26:59.115 --> 00:27:00.156]  You're misrepresenting us.
[00:27:00.196 --> 00:27:02.897]  You're saying, go after libertarians, go after nationalists.
[00:27:02.917 --> 00:27:04.117]  You're calling us Nazis.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:14.062]  Tom Arnold's telling Candace Owens to suck the racist you-know-what.
[00:27:14.722 --> 00:27:16.463]  You're the ones that are completely out of control.
[00:27:18.456 --> 00:27:22.279]  Then you point your finger at us, and you say, we're going to cause violence.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.861]  It's what my sources have told me.
[00:27:23.901 --> 00:27:35.892]  They're getting ready, the globalists, to stage attacks against universities, against media institutions, against the UN, against the Federal Reserve, to then say anybody that criticizes those things are on the side of the terrorists.
[00:27:36.232 --> 00:27:37.413]  Get ready for it!
[00:27:37.813 --> 00:27:39.095]  It's their next move!
[00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:40.876]  Amazing.
[00:27:43.632 --> 00:27:45.615]  If you want to counter this, we're going into the storm.
[00:27:46.115 --> 00:27:49.940]  And the storm's going to knock down the globalists, but it's going to hurt a lot of us on the front lines as well.
[00:27:54.266 --> 00:28:01.455]  So more than ever, InfoWars needs you to hand-share the articles, the videos, the information via your email, in person.
[00:28:02.216 --> 00:28:17.199]  To go to the URLs, newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, to put the bumper stickers on your car, to put up a billboard on the side of your barn, to reach out, but also financially support, and we make it easy, with amazing products.
[00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:29.141]  You know, if you don't know about the iodine conspiracy, and how the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, and other things fill up your glands and really hurt you, and how IQs drop, and all the cancer, and all the rest of it, it's well known you die without iodine.
[00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:30.921]  And most iodine's bound.
[00:28:31.601 --> 00:28:32.061]  We're good to go.
[00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:54.394]  But we have the only one that's 999999 pure and your body actually absorbs.
[00:28:54.774 --> 00:28:55.154]  It's X2.
[00:28:55.174 --> 00:28:55.695]  It's 25% off.
[00:28:55.795 --> 00:28:57.676]  It's going to sell out soon.
[00:28:57.696 --> 00:28:58.697]  We don't know how long we'll have it.
[00:28:59.077 --> 00:29:01.879]  Super Mel Vitality is 50% off as well in FullWorksStore.com.
[00:29:05.544 --> 00:29:08.045]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:11.186]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[00:29:11.246 --> 00:29:13.527]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[00:29:14.147 --> 00:29:15.608]  What is the latest from the UK?
[00:29:15.728 --> 00:29:24.271]  Look, remember that in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:28.492]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[00:29:28.532 --> 00:29:31.413]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[00:29:31.513 --> 00:29:32.834]  It would have been mad!
[00:29:33.434 --> 00:29:41.139]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.580]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[00:29:44.161 --> 00:29:45.882]  Trust Middle England.
[00:29:46.322 --> 00:29:47.763]  Trust Middle America.
[00:29:47.783 --> 00:29:51.565]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[00:29:51.906 --> 00:29:55.788]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[00:29:56.348 --> 00:29:57.229]  All I can tell her
[00:29:57.989 --> 00:30:06.575]  is be careful because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[00:30:06.595 --> 00:30:07.656]  Let's put it like this.
[00:30:08.217 --> 00:30:17.063]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago
[00:30:17.543 --> 00:30:22.886]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[00:30:23.346 --> 00:30:36.173]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[00:30:36.213 --> 00:30:38.374]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[00:30:38.515 --> 00:30:39.615]  You're a leading expert on this.
[00:30:39.695 --> 00:30:41.576]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:42.757]  Why are they trying to flood?
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.960]  Because they hate Christianity.
[00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:56.584]  They can't, I mean, you know, they deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[00:30:56.624 --> 00:30:57.465]  They deny that.
[00:30:57.885 --> 00:31:01.546]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[00:31:01.606 --> 00:31:02.806]  They want to get rid of it.
[00:31:03.307 --> 00:31:11.229]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:13.310]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election
[00:31:14.042 --> 00:31:19.225]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[00:31:19.285 --> 00:31:25.307]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[00:31:25.608 --> 00:31:33.871]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:39.654]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[00:31:39.694 --> 00:31:40.875]  And look, what's really happening here?
[00:31:41.395 --> 00:31:43.196]  You know, don't underestimate
[00:31:43.796 --> 00:31:46.759]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:48.160]  The victory of Brexit.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.361]  The victory of Trump.
[00:31:49.981 --> 00:31:50.822]  You know, we're winning.
[00:31:51.162 --> 00:31:52.243]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[00:31:52.483 --> 00:32:00.089]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[00:32:00.189 --> 00:32:00.990]  And you know something?
[00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.311]  If we can resist,
[00:32:03.127 --> 00:32:12.235]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[00:32:12.275 --> 00:32:14.016]  So don't get down, everybody.
[00:32:14.297 --> 00:32:15.177]  Don't get depressed.
[00:32:15.498 --> 00:32:18.000]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:24.586]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came and privately cheered him up and cheered up the troops.
[00:32:24.926 --> 00:32:27.729]  And you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:28.650]  You're amazing.
[00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:29.571]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:32:29.631 --> 00:32:30.432]  I know you're very busy.
[00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:32.374]  But that's as the EU has said.
[00:32:32.434 --> 00:32:34.916]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[00:32:34.936 --> 00:32:38.320]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:52.224]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[00:32:52.584 --> 00:32:58.045]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must protect it.
[00:32:58.546 --> 00:32:59.946]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[00:33:05.847 --> 00:33:08.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.113 --> 00:33:15.535]  Are the Clintons corrupt?
[00:33:15.996 --> 00:33:26.449]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:31.656 --> 00:33:32.976]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:33.016 --> 00:33:35.197]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:33:36.017 --> 00:33:36.618]  Let me do this.
[00:33:36.738 --> 00:33:56.924]  I've mentioned some of the headlines and I've drilled down into Congress finally having investigations into water being wet, 2 plus 2 equals 4, do liberal tech giants censor conservatives, nationalists, free market folks, patriots, anybody popular they don't control?
[00:33:59.385 --> 00:34:00.425]  Again, does a bear
[00:34:02.935 --> 00:34:03.535]  Live in the woods.
[00:34:05.496 --> 00:34:07.257]  Does a bear have brown fur?
[00:34:07.917 --> 00:34:09.618]  Well, I guess if it's a polar bear, it has white fur.
[00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:16.341]  And of course, the answer is yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.102]  Bears do live in the woods.
[00:34:19.322 --> 00:34:20.623]  Hillary Clinton is corrupt.
[00:34:21.843 --> 00:34:23.264]  And the Santa Clause is not real.
[00:34:23.904 --> 00:34:25.225]  And Obamacare is not free.
[00:34:26.165 --> 00:34:28.406]  And you did build your business, but Obama said you didn't.
[00:34:30.885 --> 00:34:38.611]  So let me just hit a few of these little tidbits for you that we're going to be getting into.
[00:34:40.112 --> 00:34:49.039]  Germany, about six years ago, banned the construction of single-family homes, saying the family's bad.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.881]  They want to encourage not having children.
[00:34:54.663 --> 00:34:59.007]  USA Today has come out and called for getting rid of the single-family home.
[00:34:59.927 --> 00:35:00.308]  It's right here.
[00:35:01.428 --> 00:35:02.548]  The single-family house.
[00:35:02.849 --> 00:35:05.189]  An American icon faces an uncertain future.
[00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.350]  And the article basically says it's bad.
[00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.790]  Get rid of it.
[00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:10.031]  This is a global plan.
[00:35:10.672 --> 00:35:14.113]  So what you see in China and what you see in Germany is the plan here.
[00:35:17.874 --> 00:35:26.958]  They want you in big Jeff Bezos-owned, Bloomberg-owned coffin apartments where you pay more for a 250-square-foot than you pay for a 2,000.
[00:35:27.978 --> 00:35:29.899]  More money and more taxes to them.
[00:35:30.643 --> 00:35:31.504]  Who were tax exempt.
[00:35:31.964 --> 00:35:38.809]  By the way, The Guardian has an article about how Jeff Bezos never pays taxes, so even the liberals admit it.
[00:35:39.649 --> 00:35:41.450]  But he's liberal-some.
[00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:45.013]  He'll live in a 40,000 square foot house.
[00:35:46.614 --> 00:35:48.895]  And have helicopters and private jets and mistresses.
[00:35:51.097 --> 00:35:52.758]  He's liberal-some.
[00:35:55.498 --> 00:36:04.922]  Like all the communist liberals and their rich parents and pulling up their Mercedes and wearing pacifiers around their necks with big bags of ecstasy.
[00:36:04.942 --> 00:36:16.668]  The police let them into Coachella and they dance around and party and pose in front of corporate logos pretending they're movie stars and then are questioned by a major publication and more than half identify as socialist and communist.
[00:36:17.895 --> 00:36:19.376]  They're the ruling class.
[00:36:19.816 --> 00:36:21.137]  They don't pay taxes.
[00:36:21.217 --> 00:36:22.678]  They take drugs all day.
[00:36:23.138 --> 00:36:24.779]  They suck on pacifiers.
[00:36:25.459 --> 00:36:29.482]  And then they hate farmers that aren't paying more.
[00:36:30.943 --> 00:36:34.045]  And people that work in factories and truck drivers.
[00:36:35.385 --> 00:36:38.127]  They're petty capitalists over there.
[00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:41.449]  We're communists with our smartphones and $200 skinny jeans.
[00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:50.832]  So we're gonna break all of that down here in just a moment.
[00:36:50.852 --> 00:36:51.992]  And of course, exclusive!
[00:36:53.352 --> 00:36:55.273]  National Geographic exclusive!
[00:36:58.534 --> 00:37:13.120]  Ancient Mass Child Sacrifice may be world's largest, but I remember sitting there for the few years I went to college, as I was realizing how worthless it was, in all the different sociology, anthropology classes I took,
[00:37:14.068 --> 00:37:14.748]  Archaeology.
[00:37:15.489 --> 00:37:18.190]  They would be real politically correct, because that was the political correctness at the time.
[00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:24.933]  They'd say, you know, there weren't really human sacrifices in Mesoamerica.
[00:37:26.053 --> 00:37:29.455]  That's a lie of the conquistadors.
[00:37:31.956 --> 00:37:35.798]  And I'm sitting there and I've been to Central America.
[00:37:35.858 --> 00:37:36.718]  I've been to Mexico.
[00:37:36.778 --> 00:37:40.720]  I've been to Tulum and Acomal and Chichen Itza and amazing sites.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.981]  And they had the Mayan guides there.
[00:37:44.193 --> 00:37:51.855]  Explaining, here we are at the Well of Souls, where there are tens of thousands of skeletons, mainly of children at the bottom, but also women.
[00:37:53.715 --> 00:37:58.416]  They were bound, their heads bashed in, and then thrown into the water goddess.
[00:38:01.677 --> 00:38:03.157]  And then they'd take you to the next place.
[00:38:05.698 --> 00:38:09.638]  But illiberal Austin, oh no, no.
[00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:11.839]  Notice the children have their heads bashed out.
[00:38:13.877 --> 00:38:15.278]  Let's just go ahead and cover this one now.
[00:38:15.338 --> 00:38:20.661]  I think we'll start here first because every culture ends up with a central government and enough corruption.
[00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:21.962]  They get a priest class finally.
[00:38:22.242 --> 00:38:23.402]  It may take a thousand years.
[00:38:24.283 --> 00:38:29.966]  It ends in child sacrifice because it's the ultimate thing to make the population submit.
[00:38:30.046 --> 00:38:41.893]  If you'll give your three-year-old up to have their throat slit and shoved into a peat bog crying for mommy with blood spraying out of their mouth, that's Scotland, Ireland, England, Germany.
[00:38:45.402 --> 00:38:46.122]  Folks lived then.
[00:38:46.142 --> 00:38:48.763]  The Germanic people did the same stuff.
[00:38:49.043 --> 00:38:50.844]  They had bonfires, bone fires.
[00:38:54.205 --> 00:38:58.186]  A lot of times the priest class would demand the king's son or daughter to be burned.
[00:38:59.647 --> 00:39:01.327]  It was an act of the priest class dominance.
[00:39:01.927 --> 00:39:07.089]  And it usually happened during societal collapse that the priest class totally took over, even from the warrior class.
[00:39:08.749 --> 00:39:16.854]  And you see that with the Aztecs and their decline even before Cortez got there with a few hundred men and conquered over 10,000 people in Mexico City today, known as Mexico City today.
[00:39:18.035 --> 00:39:21.417]  They're in the Chalupas, that's where the word Chalupa comes from, was the floating gardens.
[00:39:21.838 --> 00:39:30.524]  When he conquered the Chalupas down there, he just said they were all begging for us to kill them.
[00:39:32.185 --> 00:39:38.449]  Because the insanity had been going on so long and the hallucinating and the drugs and the occultic behavior.
[00:39:40.373 --> 00:39:49.135]  But now, exclusive old National Geographic's ready to tell us ancient mass child sacrifice may be world's largest.
[00:39:50.576 --> 00:40:01.259]  Evidence for the largest single incident of child mass sacrifice in the Americas, and likely in world history, has been discovered in Peru's north eastern coast.
[00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:04.080]  Archaeologists tell National Geographic more than 140 children and 200 young
[00:40:07.518 --> 00:40:27.905]  Llamas appear to have been ritually sacrificed in an event that took place 550 years ago, right when Cortez was showing up, on a windswept bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in the shadow of what was then the sprawling capital of the empire.
[00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:39.474]  Scientific investigations by the International Interdisciplinary Team, led by Gabriel Praetio of the Université Nationale.
[00:40:40.095 --> 00:40:41.256]  And then it goes into what they found.
[00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:45.074]  The work is supported by grants from the National Geographic Society.
[00:40:45.614 --> 00:41:03.784]  While incidents of human sacrifice among the Aztec Mayan Inca have been recorded in colonial-era Spanish chronicles and documented in modern scientific excavations, the discovery of a large-scale child sacrifice event in the little-known pre-Columbian civilization is unprecedented in the Americas, if not in the entire world!
[00:41:06.185 --> 00:41:06.605]  Really?
[00:41:06.625 --> 00:41:07.906]  The Babylonians?
[00:41:08.606 --> 00:41:09.167]  Uh, the...
[00:41:11.618 --> 00:41:18.583]  The Hittites, the Sumerians, the... I mean, they were all worshiping Baal, Baal.
[00:41:19.003 --> 00:41:21.445]  The Bible says, give not your children the fires of Baal.
[00:41:21.886 --> 00:41:31.533]  There are biblical accounts of, in one night, 500 children put on a hot burning grill to Molech.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:41.362]  In fact, just type in ancient carvings of Moloch, and they're throwing children onto the arms of Moloch, but the people didn't get the meat.
[00:41:41.922 --> 00:41:47.524]  It was all left there to burn through the night, and the fat of the children boiled up into the sky.
[00:41:47.544 --> 00:41:56.746]  Of course, Baal's got nice little horns and looks like your archetypal devil, but it's no big deal.
[00:41:58.186 --> 00:41:58.866]  It doesn't exist.
[00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:00.427]  Go back to sleep.
[00:42:01.397 --> 00:42:02.338]  Show folks, mowlet.
[00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:04.260]  Can be an owl, can be a bull.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.541]  It's a bull in Samaria.
[00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:06.782]  A bull in Tyre.
[00:42:06.802 --> 00:42:13.768]  And I, of course, is the first person ever successfully and the only person to infiltrate and get it all on video.
[00:42:13.788 --> 00:42:14.388]  But it's no big deal.
[00:42:15.149 --> 00:42:16.050]  Just world leaders doing it.
[00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.550]  No big deal.
[00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.492]  Doing a mock sacrifice though to the children.
[00:42:21.595 --> 00:42:23.176]  Different ovens.
[00:42:23.316 --> 00:42:25.038]  The Canaanite God associated with child sacrifice.
[00:42:26.311 --> 00:42:28.595]  But all the liberals say, oh, it doesn't exist.
[00:42:28.635 --> 00:42:32.901]  There's no ancient forms of earth worship where children are burned.
[00:42:32.942 --> 00:42:34.965]  It's all a lie of the Christian church.
[00:42:35.646 --> 00:42:36.086]  Yes.
[00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:37.549]  Yes, of course.
[00:42:37.569 --> 00:42:38.691]  Ha ha!
[00:42:40.051 --> 00:42:41.633]  So, uh, there you go.
[00:42:41.953 --> 00:42:46.899]  When we come back, I'm going to get into the United Nations plan.
[00:42:46.919 --> 00:42:48.702]  You heard Macron said 200 million Africans.
[00:42:48.942 --> 00:42:50.644]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:50.664 --> 00:42:53.648]  500 million, and to settle Europe in the next 20 years.
[00:42:54.288 --> 00:42:56.151]  This is less, yeah, less, 25, 30 years.
[00:42:57.112 --> 00:42:59.615]  And you better accept it.
[00:43:02.742 --> 00:43:05.405]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:43:05.825 --> 00:43:10.971]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:14.574]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:43:14.995 --> 00:43:18.518]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:43:19.139 --> 00:43:30.406]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:43:31.047 --> 00:43:41.794]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:43:42.094 --> 00:43:47.517]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.

[00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.083]  It's a 360 win.
[00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:58.770]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle, you're helping the fight for freedom.
[00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:00.411]  So please go to the site now.
[00:44:00.852 --> 00:44:02.434]  We need your support.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:12.382]  2016 was the year in which the mainstream media lost their hammerlock, their complete monopoly on political discourse in this country.
[00:44:12.682 --> 00:44:24.245]  Donald Trump's election, in fact the entire sea change in American politics, was only made possible through a robust and vibrant alternative media allowed through an unfettered internet.
[00:44:24.565 --> 00:44:44.430]  This is not only about the 2016 and 2020 elections, it's about the slow motion coup that's going on in this country, where a fabricated dossier can be used to justify legally the illegal surveillance, the unconstitutional surveillance on the Republican candidate for President of the United States.
[00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:52.873]  But you see, those who are the perps in that crime don't want any discussion of that crime in the mainstream or the alternative media.
[00:44:52.933 --> 00:45:00.736]  And that is why they seek, through a very, I think, duplicitous strategy of lawfare,
[00:45:01.656 --> 00:45:04.177]  And censorship to shut us down.
[00:45:04.437 --> 00:45:16.141]  The key to this, of course, is the lawsuits, and I'm facing one from an Obama-blessed Front Call Project Democracy, who are suing me and Donald Trump.
[00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:20.743]  The allegation being that we worked with the Russians to hack
[00:45:21.603 --> 00:45:25.325]  Uh, the Democratic National Committee and give that material to WikiLeaks.
[00:45:25.485 --> 00:45:31.428]  That is as unprovable in a court of law as it will be unprovable in the court of public opinion.
[00:45:31.688 --> 00:45:33.269]  Because it's a fairy tale.
[00:45:33.769 --> 00:45:34.589]  A falsehood.
[00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:35.850]  A lie.
[00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:37.110]  A canard.
[00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:39.812]  A steaming plate of, well, you know.
[00:45:40.892 --> 00:46:00.354]  The point here, of course, is that if they can silence us, if they can take us off of Facebook, off of Twitter, off of YouTube, it becomes much easier to drive their false narrative about the 2016 election, their false narrative about the unconstitutional activities going on today,
[00:46:00.814 --> 00:46:14.140]  Whether it is raiding Donald Trump's lawyer's office or whether it is the illegal surveillance of the Republican candidate for president under FISA warrants that were fabricated in their rationale, fabricated in their purpose.
[00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:17.262]  And then, of course, there's the Second Amendment.
[00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:22.285]  Silence us before you attempt to take away our Second Amendment rights.
[00:46:22.845 --> 00:46:23.625]  This is a struggle.
[00:46:23.826 --> 00:46:26.487]  This is the single most important struggle.
[00:46:26.927 --> 00:46:27.228]  Why?
[00:46:27.288 --> 00:46:35.713]  Because without our voice, all other issues, trade, immigration, the economy, we are at an enormous disadvantage.
[00:46:36.153 --> 00:46:39.375]  The real story here is that the American left
[00:46:39.855 --> 00:46:42.437]  No longer is interested in dialogue or debate.
[00:46:42.937 --> 00:46:44.458]  They can't win a debate.
[00:46:44.838 --> 00:46:46.159]  They don't want a debate.
[00:46:46.479 --> 00:46:48.301]  They don't want a discussion of issues.
[00:46:48.641 --> 00:46:55.345]  Their answer when we raise facts and arguments is silence them, censor them, close them down.
[00:46:55.786 --> 00:46:58.427]  That's why you know they have lost.
[00:46:58.928 --> 00:46:59.268]  Thank you.
[00:47:06.784 --> 00:47:11.428]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.063]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[00:47:28.664 --> 00:47:31.907]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:39.255 --> 00:47:46.183]  Well, there's a new chapter in the whole Kanye West battle against the Thought Police, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:47.505 --> 00:47:54.453]  Yesterday, we had the top story on DrudgeReport.com, where he was standing up to the Thought Police.
[00:47:54.513 --> 00:47:59.138]  I tweeted it out at RealAlexJones, Kanye Unleashed, and he said, listen,
[00:48:00.094 --> 00:48:02.315]  Quit trying to intimidate me, quit trying to bully me.
[00:48:03.076 --> 00:48:07.098]  I'm going to continue to stand up for free thought and free speech.
[00:48:07.578 --> 00:48:13.581]  I don't dislike anybody, I don't dislike the Democrats, but I have a right to my thoughts and my views.
[00:48:13.621 --> 00:48:22.646]  Well, now he just tweeted out, we're retweeting it at Real Alex Jones, as we speak, a conversation he had with one of his friends this morning.
[00:48:23.991 --> 00:48:25.412]  Trying to basically intimidate him.
[00:48:25.452 --> 00:48:31.255]  And he said, listen, I love you, my friend, but don't try to use fear on me to shut down my free thought.
[00:48:32.335 --> 00:48:32.816]  Exactly.
[00:48:32.856 --> 00:48:34.176]  That is so authoritarian.
[00:48:34.597 --> 00:48:35.577]  That's what's dangerous.
[00:48:37.898 --> 00:48:38.939]  That's what's out of control.
[00:48:38.959 --> 00:48:49.985]  So we're going to get to that here in just a moment and then get to this huge news about the UN warning of 500 million Islamists coming into Europe, opening the borders, but spinning it like
[00:48:51.863 --> 00:48:54.986]  It's a ISIS plan when ISIS is working with the globalists.
[00:48:55.006 --> 00:48:58.648]  We're going to look at all of that right now.
[00:48:59.449 --> 00:49:08.876]  Now before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen, Survival Field X2 is, from our research, the purest true atomic iodine.
[00:49:08.897 --> 00:49:14.621]  And that just means it's atomic, periodical table system.
[00:49:15.121 --> 00:49:15.602]  The others
[00:49:17.912 --> 00:49:30.838]  The other forms of iodine are bound to other substances and go through your body and can even have some unpleasurable effects in the stomach in my experience.
[00:49:32.176 --> 00:49:33.997]  Because we knew how good iodine was a decade ago.
[00:49:34.017 --> 00:49:42.479]  We were looking into putting it into a supplement, but every company I went to, scores of them had it bound types in alcohol, saying it was atomic, it was pure crud.
[00:49:43.779 --> 00:49:46.280]  Try to eat the stuff at the store, it'll eat a hole in your stomach, don't do it.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.302]  This is the only iodine that myself and my family can take with no problems or side effects.
[00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:53.222]  Consult your physician.
[00:49:53.262 --> 00:49:54.342]  But you die without iodine.
[00:49:54.803 --> 00:49:58.304]  But there's less and less of it in the soil, in the plants, in the meat, in the food.
[00:49:58.644 --> 00:49:59.464]  Most of it's bound.
[00:50:01.886 --> 00:50:03.047]  But we're running out of X2.
[00:50:03.067 --> 00:50:08.511]  We're probably going to be able to get more, but the places we get it are increasing the price of the atomic iodine.
[00:50:10.476 --> 00:50:12.677]  Obviously a lot of it, I think, is industrial sabotage.
[00:50:12.697 --> 00:50:13.397]  People try to block us.
[00:50:13.417 --> 00:50:14.618]  They try to stop us at every front.
[00:50:14.658 --> 00:50:16.338]  But we got an extra shipment in.
[00:50:16.558 --> 00:50:18.199]  We can keep it discounted for a few more days.
[00:50:18.439 --> 00:50:19.859]  Then it's got to go back to regular price.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:26.242]  Survival Shield X2, exclusively available in fullworkstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:26.262 --> 00:50:28.403]  The real red pill's amazing.

[00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:39.270]  Good for men and women.
[00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.571]  It's the Real Red Pill.
[00:50:40.591 --> 00:50:41.631]  Takes about a week to kick in.

[00:50:46.015 --> 00:50:47.376]  But they're all brain and body.
[00:50:47.396 --> 00:50:47.996]  They're amazing.
[00:50:48.317 --> 00:50:49.397]  Super Male's 50% off.

[00:50:53.281 --> 00:50:53.981]  Get them together though.
[00:50:54.021 --> 00:50:54.962]  Get free shipping on the combo.
[00:50:58.177 --> 00:50:59.778]  So, it's all there.
[00:50:59.818 --> 00:51:01.859]  Makes it easy to support the broadcast and free speech.
[00:51:02.739 --> 00:51:03.780]  The ultimate game changer.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:04.981]  Super Mel Vitality.
[00:51:05.001 --> 00:51:05.581]  50% off.
[00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:06.841]  A lot of folks taking advantage of that.
[00:51:07.322 --> 00:51:08.642]  We've got the Pollen Block.
[00:51:09.743 --> 00:51:12.064]  Amazing for all the pollen and seasonal discomfort out there.
[00:51:12.604 --> 00:51:13.465]  Very proprietary.
[00:51:13.605 --> 00:51:14.125]  Documented.
[00:51:14.165 --> 00:51:14.585]  Patented.
[00:51:15.266 --> 00:51:15.806]  Look into that.
[00:51:15.866 --> 00:51:17.487]  We've got Brain Force.
[00:51:17.527 --> 00:51:19.028]  We've got so many other great products.
[00:51:19.288 --> 00:51:22.369]  So be sure and peruse through everything at infowarestore.com.
[00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:23.110]  Okay.
[00:51:24.497 --> 00:51:25.838]  Let me get back to Kanye West.
[00:51:26.598 --> 00:51:31.901]  People sit there and they point out, Kanye West has been with Lebronavich, the Aleister Crowley witch.
[00:51:33.141 --> 00:51:35.963]  And he said he liked Obama.
[00:51:37.463 --> 00:51:38.984]  And you know, there's Kim Kardashian with her.
[00:51:39.044 --> 00:51:42.466]  Yes, that witch woman is the god of Hollywood, an Aleister Crowley witch.
[00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.647]  In her own Reddit, ask me anything.
[00:51:46.067 --> 00:51:47.488]  She's tied into the Podesta email.
[00:51:47.508 --> 00:51:48.909]  She's super uber bad news.
[00:51:50.202 --> 00:51:54.623]  What, who do you think's at these parties, these narcissist parties in Hollywood and New York?
[00:51:55.703 --> 00:51:56.784]  This woman is worshipped.
[00:51:56.824 --> 00:51:57.484]  She's everywhere.
[00:51:58.724 --> 00:52:13.968]  Uh, and you got the thief and the murderer hanging on the cross by Christ, uh, on the Hill of Golgotha on the Skull Hill at Calvary.
[00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.229]  And
[00:52:18.717 --> 00:52:20.959]  That's Jay-Z on screen of your radio listener with her.
[00:52:22.281 --> 00:52:27.606]  And one of them repents, one of them doesn't, and Christ says the one that repents, she'll be with me today in paradise.
[00:52:28.347 --> 00:52:32.030]  And the point is, I judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:52:32.491 --> 00:52:41.540]  Even hanging around Hollywood scum, all that soulless empty garbage where they're all looking to be fulfilled because they're so empty so they get deeper into the evil, deeper into the darkness trying to find it.
[00:52:43.203 --> 00:52:45.284]  I can't even be around Hollywood, be around these people.
[00:52:45.725 --> 00:52:47.686]  They feel so empty, so weak.
[00:52:47.846 --> 00:52:53.270]  I feel so bad around them that you couldn't pay me a trillion dollars to hang out with these people.
[00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:55.191]  They are spiritually dead.
[00:52:57.033 --> 00:52:59.594]  Now, you don't have photos of Kanye West with her.
[00:52:59.694 --> 00:53:03.097]  You can sit there and put photos up next to each other, but it doesn't matter.
[00:53:04.018 --> 00:53:08.260]  What matters is what he's doing now and the courage he's got to stand against this.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.381]  We're not making him an idol.
[00:53:09.862 --> 00:53:11.603]  We're saying we support free speech.
[00:53:13.868 --> 00:53:14.930]  We support free thinking.
[00:53:14.971 --> 00:53:22.187]  So here's his latest private message on his phone he put out on his Twitter that we just retweeted at RealAlexJones.
[00:53:23.939 --> 00:53:26.600]  Yo, thank you so much in an earlier message then.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.000]  Hey, it's JL.
[00:53:28.481 --> 00:53:30.121]  I hope you reconsider aligning yourself with Trump.
[00:53:30.521 --> 00:53:35.403]  You're way too powerful and influential to endorse who he is and what he stands for.
[00:53:35.843 --> 00:53:38.424]  As you know, what you say really means something to our fans.
[00:53:38.984 --> 00:53:40.885]  They are loyal to you and respect your opinion.
[00:53:41.245 --> 00:53:48.628]  So many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump policies cause, especially the people of color.
[00:53:49.605 --> 00:53:51.506]  Don't let this be part of your legacy.
[00:53:51.786 --> 00:53:53.147]  You're the greatest artist of our generation.
[00:53:53.808 --> 00:53:56.129]  I love you, John, and I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:53:56.929 --> 00:54:02.013]  You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.
[00:54:02.693 --> 00:54:03.193]  Total truth.
[00:54:04.854 --> 00:54:07.316]  He's not even... He said, I don't agree with a lot of what Trump does.
[00:54:07.636 --> 00:54:09.377]  He says, I've known the guy of 10 plus years.
[00:54:09.677 --> 00:54:10.418]  He's my friend.
[00:54:10.438 --> 00:54:11.618]  I know he's a good guy.
[00:54:11.638 --> 00:54:16.061]  I like to support him because he's under attack to say I support free thought.
[00:54:16.581 --> 00:54:17.062]  And there's another...
[00:54:17.938 --> 00:54:23.703]  Chicago rapper, well known, has come out and said, yeah, you don't have to be a Democrat if you're black.
[00:54:25.885 --> 00:54:28.327]  You don't have to be anything if you're black or white.
[00:54:28.367 --> 00:54:30.028]  You could be apolitical.
[00:54:31.269 --> 00:54:34.452]  But meanwhile, celebs attack Kanye West over pro-Trump tweets.
[00:54:34.712 --> 00:54:36.274]  Complete freaking lunatic!
[00:54:39.336 --> 00:54:41.939]  All these talentless losers have to say about him.
[00:54:41.959 --> 00:54:43.680]  I'm not going to even give these people any attention.
[00:54:44.621 --> 00:54:45.642]  But Rosie O'Donnell,
[00:54:49.482 --> 00:54:50.922]  The director of Guardians of the Galaxy?
[00:54:50.983 --> 00:54:51.503]  Who cares?
[00:54:53.603 --> 00:54:55.724]  So, that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:55.764 --> 00:54:56.684]  It's about courage.
[00:54:57.465 --> 00:54:59.145]  And it's about not being cowards.
[00:54:59.705 --> 00:55:02.626]  And it's about standing up when you've got everything to lose.
[00:55:02.686 --> 00:55:07.928]  But see, he realizes we've got everything to lose if we let this tyranny take over and run the entire planet.
[00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:10.629]  Now, I mentioned this earlier, so I thought I'd show it to you.
[00:55:10.649 --> 00:55:11.910]  It's from Infowars.com.
[00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:13.030]  It's also in the Daily Mail.
[00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.931]  Open borders advocate anally raped by migrant.
[00:55:16.991 --> 00:55:18.212]  But raped by others as well.
[00:55:19.413 --> 00:55:28.518]  Swedish woman said she hung out with suspects to prove she wasn't xenophobic, went to the refugee center, got raped to prove she wasn't a racist.
[00:55:28.679 --> 00:55:31.280]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.641]  So I mentioned that, I thought I'd show it to you.
[00:55:33.081 --> 00:55:33.442]  Here it is.
[00:55:33.782 --> 00:55:39.726]  500 million Africans, that's North Africans, Islamicists, could invade Europe under ISIS plan, UN official says.
[00:55:40.206 --> 00:55:44.589]  It was the UN, it was the globalists, it was their whole program.
[00:55:46.118 --> 00:56:00.807]  On record, to invite the Islamists in, and then ISIS said it was part of their plan too, and to give them housing, and to give them free welfare, and to give them all this garbage to incentivize, and then Macron and the UN even admitted in the last month
[00:56:06.351 --> 00:56:22.626]  They keep pushing this whole plan to incentivize and Europe advertises it and now the UN, two weeks after Macron, said we're going to take in 200 million North Africans and kick people out of their hotels, kick people out of their own apartments, kick people out of their own Section 8 homes in Italy and Germany.
[00:56:23.226 --> 00:56:26.308]  Put a thousand migrants in a town of 76 Germans.
[00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:36.537]  We're showing footage on here a year ago of a little Italian innkeeper on the coast having his tenants thrown out, no pay, and North Africans that Soros shipped in on big old rubber boats.
[00:56:36.557 --> 00:56:39.699]  So that story's on NewsWars.com.
[00:56:40.099 --> 00:56:42.882]  We've also launched Europe.InfoWars.com.
[00:56:44.633 --> 00:56:49.056]  We're going to be telling you more about that in the near future with our whole European Bureau we're setting up.
[00:56:49.577 --> 00:56:50.317]  So check that out.
[00:56:50.878 --> 00:56:53.420]  Meanwhile, here's the London Guardian telling you what we just told you.
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.223]  ISIS trying to foment a wave of migration to Europe, says UN official.
[00:56:57.783 --> 00:56:59.585]  Yeah, and you're rolling out the red carpet.
[00:57:00.105 --> 00:57:05.069]  Meanwhile, the very same UN group, Central American asylum seeker caravan reaches US border.
[00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:08.192]  Thousands set to hit over the weekend.
[00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:15.896]  They're set to come across the Tijuana Bridge and try to force their way in, but Mexico's telling us take them, but nobody's saying Mexico should take them.
[00:57:16.456 --> 00:57:28.706]  See, only the evil El Norte must take these giant third world populations that'll drive down the wages and help no one but the globalists further foment the collapse of civilization.
[00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:32.189]  And we too can live in the bloodbath that is Latin America.
[00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:43.293]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side with several special guests at the 6 After in studio and a ton of other news.
[00:57:43.353 --> 00:57:45.254]  It's a revolutionary act to tell the truth.
[00:57:45.274 --> 00:57:47.436]  To quote George Orwell, we're doing it.
[00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.338]  Please spread the live video feeds.
[00:57:49.598 --> 00:57:51.060]  Please spread the articles and videos.
[00:57:55.233 --> 00:57:57.094]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[00:57:57.114 --> 00:57:57.394]  Go ahead.
[00:57:57.534 --> 00:58:01.356]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[00:58:01.557 --> 00:58:06.559]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:21.768]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your full skill that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[00:58:22.508 --> 00:58:25.311]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[00:58:25.991 --> 00:58:29.634]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:36.579]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[00:58:36.719 --> 00:58:41.363]  I'm just here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[00:58:41.803 --> 00:58:43.564]  How they're demonizing my state.
[00:58:43.604 --> 00:58:45.026]  I just can't stand it anymore.
[00:58:45.746 --> 00:58:47.108]  You have changed my life.
[00:58:47.208 --> 00:58:50.012]  Info Wars has changed my family's life.
[00:58:50.513 --> 00:58:56.101]  I got property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[00:58:56.161 --> 00:59:00.687]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[00:59:01.548 --> 00:59:02.850]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:08.357]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[00:59:08.377 --> 00:59:09.698]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[00:59:09.738 --> 00:59:09.919]  Yeah.
[00:59:10.059 --> 00:59:11.961]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:12.802]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[00:59:12.842 --> 00:59:14.524]  We love you, and tell your husband we love him.
[00:59:14.564 --> 00:59:15.526]  We really appreciate you.
[00:59:15.906 --> 00:59:16.587]  Keep up the fight.
[00:59:16.627 --> 00:59:18.029]  We need to take California back.
[00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.429]  Thank you, Desiree.
[00:59:18.449 --> 00:59:19.531]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[00:59:19.591 --> 00:59:20.171]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:59:22.426 --> 00:59:24.287]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.347 --> 00:59:26.248]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:26.308 --> 00:59:29.029]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.229 --> 00:59:30.049]  Alex Jones.
[00:59:30.149 --> 00:59:32.891]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:32.951 --> 00:59:36.172]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:59:36.192 --> 00:59:37.513]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[00:59:37.613 --> 00:59:39.453]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:59:39.554 --> 00:59:41.354]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:59:41.374 --> 00:59:45.456]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:59:45.476 --> 00:59:46.637]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:46.717 --> 00:59:51.619]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:59:54.645 --> 00:59:58.757]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.279 --> 01:00:00.563]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:12.242]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:12.782 --> 01:00:14.623]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.583 --> 01:00:18.704]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:00:19.305 --> 01:00:21.626]  Run on for a long time.
[01:00:22.226 --> 01:00:23.206]  Run on for a long time.
[01:00:23.446 --> 01:00:37.853]  All right, Ben Garrison is in studio along with Sabo, two amazing artists, because I'm telling you, all of us going out, whether it's sticking a bumper sticker on a light pole or on our car or painting our barn up with Infowars.com or your own local news site,
[01:00:38.598 --> 01:00:43.460]  That's even more powerful to have your own liberty, truth-based site that's just little stories you do, things you post.
[01:00:44.281 --> 01:00:45.301]  Maybe a blog you do.
[01:00:45.862 --> 01:00:47.142]  Think little, think big, whatever.
[01:00:47.262 --> 01:00:48.163]  Little becomes big.
[01:00:48.943 --> 01:00:51.905]  And then small towns, you name it, are even easier to wake folks up in.
[01:00:52.485 --> 01:00:54.506]  And then you just put them on the side of the bar on your website.
[01:00:54.526 --> 01:01:02.290]  So we're going to talk about how we fight back on the street, peacefully, against the thought police.
[01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.431]  The second American Revolution is here.
[01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:05.051]  It's global.
[01:01:06.012 --> 01:01:08.113]  It's really the tail end of the Renaissance.
[01:01:09.755 --> 01:01:11.476]  That's what the globalists are fighting to steal the future?
[01:01:12.216 --> 01:01:13.376]  This is the war for the future.
[01:01:14.477 --> 01:01:17.638]  So Sabo and Ben Garrison in studio.
[01:01:17.698 --> 01:01:20.899]  Then I don't play enough of Paul Watson's reports.
[01:01:21.379 --> 01:01:25.261]  He's got some new really powerful ones that I'm going to play in that next hour.
[01:01:25.441 --> 01:01:36.285]  And then we've got Matt Bracken on because he concurs they're getting ready to launch massive false flags against their own liberal targets in a big, big way so that they can try to
[01:01:37.717 --> 01:01:41.359]  Play the sympathy card and say, see, we've got to ban the conservatives and libertarians.
[01:01:41.679 --> 01:01:43.339]  See, Trump's going to cause us to get attacked.
[01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:44.840]  We told you that a few weeks ago.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.960]  We told you that this weekend.
[01:01:46.421 --> 01:01:52.703]  Now, CNN, MSNBC, AP, the Democrats say, you're going to cause violence when they're the ones fomenting it.
[01:01:53.504 --> 01:01:55.985]  And they have ISIS coming out saying they're going to attack leftist targets.
[01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:59.186]  And there's been the whole left funding ISIS in the whole area of Spring.
[01:01:59.226 --> 01:02:02.087]  This is transparent as a $3 bill.
[01:02:02.447 --> 01:02:03.388]  This is as fake as a $3 bill.
[01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:09.394]  But before we go to break, I want to just go out to break, playing Jim Acosta.
[01:02:09.714 --> 01:02:13.560]  Trump supporters don't have all their faculties and talk about how they're going to cause violence.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.142]  And I just want to play another clip.
[01:02:15.162 --> 01:02:17.686]  Macron tells, reset nationalism.
[01:02:17.706 --> 01:02:19.648]  You know, he's a little globalist selling that program.
[01:02:20.049 --> 01:02:20.730]  A Trojan horse.
[01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:27.857]  And then I want to get into a Belgian TV crew pelted with rocks in Brussels, Belgium, because there are no go zones.
[01:02:28.157 --> 01:02:32.441]  And that ties into a Sweden, an old man being beaten up.
[01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:35.184]  These are so many of these videos, I can't keep track of them.
[01:02:35.224 --> 01:02:36.886]  So let's just play those videos.
[01:02:37.706 --> 01:02:51.819]  Going out to break and we'll come back with ooh that smell great piece Rob do and I put together Tying it into the true war crimes and true demonic behavior of Obama and Hillary So here is all those clips together and we'll be back in the info war
[01:02:53.044 --> 01:02:58.407]  But the problem is that people around the country don't know it's an act.
[01:02:58.447 --> 01:02:59.488]  They're not in on the act.
[01:02:59.708 --> 01:03:02.129]  And they take what he says very seriously.
[01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:09.253]  And they take attacks from Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders and what they do to us on a daily basis very seriously.
[01:03:09.574 --> 01:03:11.775]  They don't have all their faculties in some cases.
[01:03:12.395 --> 01:03:13.996]  Their elevator might not hit all floors.
[01:03:14.456 --> 01:03:19.119]  My concern is that a journalist is going to be hurt one of these days.
[01:03:19.159 --> 01:03:19.980]  Somebody's going to get hurt.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:30.094]  And at that point, you know, the White House, the President of the United States, they're going to have to take a hard look in the mirror and ask themselves whether or not they played a role in this.
[01:03:30.275 --> 01:03:34.441]  Whether they created this toxic environment that resulted in a journalist getting hurt.
[01:03:34.661 --> 01:03:36.484]  And the moment that a journalist gets hurt,
[01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:38.104]  Jim, I'm going to take a look.
[01:04:01.144 --> 01:04:08.550]  It is together that we can resist the rise of aggressive nationalisms that deny our history and divide the world.
[01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:18.438]  It is together that we will build a new strong multilateralism that defends pluralism and democracy in the face of ill winds.
[01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:27.325]  Because our culture, our identity has always been true for our countries while inspiring the universal.
[01:04:28.462 --> 01:04:36.526]  For our culture, our identity, has always been to work for our countries, while aspiring to universality.
[01:04:36.546 --> 01:04:38.807]  Here they come!
[01:04:38.867 --> 01:04:39.368]  Here they come!
[01:04:39.388 --> 01:04:39.828]  Here they come!
[01:04:39.848 --> 01:04:40.188]  Here they come!
[01:04:40.228 --> 01:04:40.788]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[01:04:40.828 --> 01:04:41.489]  No, really, go, go!
[01:04:41.509 --> 01:04:42.069]  It's really not fair!
[01:04:42.089 --> 01:04:42.809]  We're going off the lift!
[01:04:42.849 --> 01:04:44.210]  We're going off the lift!
[01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:44.390]  Oh!
[01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:44.490]  Oh!
[01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:47.632]  I can't believe it!
[01:04:59.804 --> 01:05:00.005]  We're good.

[01:06:07.421 --> 01:06:09.122]  There's not even the same universe.
[01:06:09.422 --> 01:06:12.423]  I mean, she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell.
[01:06:12.443 --> 01:06:19.685]  People around her say she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares.
[01:06:20.005 --> 01:06:21.366]  They're freaking out.
[01:06:21.406 --> 01:06:27.268]  Folks, they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:36.226]  What's different at this point, Doug, than me?
[01:06:36.346 --> 01:06:38.649]  I have two words for you.
[01:06:38.689 --> 01:06:39.570]  But it is wrong.
[01:06:54.103 --> 01:07:00.869]  There's a guy on the radio.
[01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:04.532]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[01:07:04.592 --> 01:07:07.635]  Said we smell like salt.
[01:07:07.755 --> 01:07:09.957]  Ain't that something?
[01:07:35.046 --> 01:07:39.769]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.330]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:57.741]  So, Matt, there it is.
[01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:03.460]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:13.702]  Well, what a treat!
[01:08:13.862 --> 01:08:24.030]  Ben Garrison and Sabo, two of the most prolific, successful, Americana, libertarian, free-thinking, I wouldn't even call them liberal or conservative, because I know both you guys.
[01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:28.393]  Garrison really well, probably interviewed him 20 times, very familiar with Sabo's work.
[01:08:28.794 --> 01:08:34.778]  He was on with us last week, and I remember saying, man, we've got to get you guys to town, and so you're here.
[01:08:34.798 --> 01:08:35.339]  Thanks for coming.
[01:08:35.639 --> 01:08:36.440]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.120]  Good to have you.
[01:08:38.721 --> 01:08:40.303]  Let's just get right into it right now.
[01:08:42.222 --> 01:08:55.413]  We're here to talk about the power of art, and how it's under attack, and the power of communication, Kanye West, all this, the power of expression, and how that's being demonized, and how we're seeing the biggest push in modern history to eradicate it in the West.
[01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:59.276]  So Ben Garrison, Sabo, get on up to the microphone.
[01:08:59.476 --> 01:09:03.560]  Tell us your declaration of independence against this, and the time and space you think we're in right now.
[01:09:05.236 --> 01:09:11.783]  Well, as for me, I come from a newspaper background, and I'm very familiar with editorial cartoons.
[01:09:12.083 --> 01:09:15.667]  And for far too long, the left has dominated that field.
[01:09:16.808 --> 01:09:24.176]  And what they do in their cartoons, they always end up calling for more big government,
[01:09:25.174 --> 01:09:26.035]  And more taxes.
[01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:35.665]  And so I want to take a different tack, and big government to me, they create more problems than they solve.
[01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:45.915]  I mean, I'm reminded of a quote by Milton Friedman who said, if the federal government was in charge of the Sahara Desert, in five years there'd be a shortage of sand.
[01:09:47.428 --> 01:10:05.526]  I want to draw in my cartoons, I mean, there are very few conservative cartoonists, and I was telling Sabo, who's from LA, the famous cartoonist there was a Paul Conrad, and he says, he said conservatives cannot be funny, they cannot be editorial cartoonists because they support the status quo.
[01:10:05.606 --> 01:10:06.927]  What's the status quo now?
[01:10:07.027 --> 01:10:07.948]  It's the deep state?
[01:10:08.826 --> 01:10:15.372]  And it's the corrupt situation in Washington, so there's plenty, there's plenty to go after.
[01:10:15.952 --> 01:10:17.574]  A conservative cartoonist can go after.
[01:10:17.634 --> 01:10:19.535]  And let me reverse that.
[01:10:20.496 --> 01:10:24.860]  Let me reverse that, I think it's Sabo's take on it, and his declaration of why he's here and what he's standing up for.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.723]  Of course, we'll introduce who he is and who he are, but most folks don't need that.
[01:10:28.763 --> 01:10:31.426]  But for folks that don't, they need to go check out your work, because it's amazing.
[01:10:33.072 --> 01:10:47.817]  If Milton Friedman could turn the Sahara Desert green in five years, to show the power of capitalism, it's a metaphor, then communists, people like Kim Jong-un, they could turn the Brazilian rainforest to the Sahara in five years.
[01:10:49.023 --> 01:10:49.623]  Sure he could.
[01:10:50.423 --> 01:10:51.623]  Well, what's my take on it?
[01:10:51.964 --> 01:10:53.244]  We're in the midst of the battle, man.
[01:10:53.504 --> 01:10:54.184]  I'm loving it.
[01:10:55.024 --> 01:10:56.924]  People always tell me, why don't you move to Texas, man?
[01:10:56.964 --> 01:10:57.885]  They'll love you in Texas.
[01:10:57.905 --> 01:10:59.845]  I'm like, why would I want to do that?
[01:10:59.885 --> 01:11:03.025]  I like being right in the middle of the thick of it in LA.
[01:11:03.846 --> 01:11:07.506]  And I'm excited.
[01:11:07.766 --> 01:11:09.727]  It's going to be a very interesting two years.
[01:11:09.747 --> 01:11:12.227]  I'm sure we're all going to be nice and tired when it's done.
[01:11:12.247 --> 01:11:17.668]  I don't know what more to say.
[01:11:18.234 --> 01:11:24.759]  There's a quickening right now, and of course you should probably... Ben Garrison's probably well known as Ben Garrison because he's more public.
[01:11:24.859 --> 01:11:37.447]  You are just as well known for your viral street art, where you, you know, for the Oscars, put up huge signs saying, and the award goes to the number one pedophile, and it goes totally viral.
[01:11:37.487 --> 01:11:42.311]  So, for radio listeners, not just for TV viewers, describe some of your most viral work and why you got into it.
[01:11:44.045 --> 01:11:46.809]  I would say Ted Cruz, helping out Ted Cruz with his campaign.
[01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:50.194]  Not directly, that helped out, that opened a few doors.
[01:11:51.195 --> 01:11:55.821]  It seems with every hit it's got to get a little bigger and bigger, a little more involved.
[01:11:56.462 --> 01:11:59.546]  But just learning how to
[01:12:01.376 --> 01:12:02.156]  I'm not sure.
[01:12:02.316 --> 01:12:04.198]  I can't believe I'm drawing a damn blank here.
[01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:04.979]  You're doing great.
[01:12:05.019 --> 01:12:05.739]  You were on last week.
[01:12:05.759 --> 01:12:06.360]  We're on fire.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:11.844]  In fact, let's show some of Sabo's incredible art from his amazing website, unsavoryagents.com.
[01:12:12.045 --> 01:12:13.346]  Let's keep rolling through these guys' art.
[01:12:13.366 --> 01:12:13.686]  There it is.
[01:12:13.926 --> 01:12:18.630]  And the Oscar for Biggest Pedophile goes to... I mean, that reached over a billion people.
[01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:27.638]  That was all over the news and reminded us, hey, all these sanctimonious people with the fake Me Too movement is a smoke screen for their giant pedophile devil worship command base.
[01:12:28.298 --> 01:12:29.920]  I love living in Hollywood because of it.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:33.563]  I'm waiting for those doors to open up and the whole place to just melt.
[01:12:34.063 --> 01:12:35.284]  I'd love to be a part of it.
[01:12:35.304 --> 01:12:45.914]  I was telling someone the other day, when I die, I want people to say that that guy, like another issue, it's like he helped to turn a lot of black people away from the Democrat plantation.
[01:12:46.514 --> 01:12:50.477]  And we're starting to see that now with Candace Owens and P. Diddy.
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:52.901]  And these are exciting times.
[01:12:53.201 --> 01:13:00.763]  I tell rock musicians in Hollywood, it's like these are the days Bob Dylan came from.
[01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:03.444]  These are the times that heroes are made.
[01:13:03.744 --> 01:13:05.305]  For God's sakes, drop your nuts.
[01:13:06.305 --> 01:13:08.006]  Start writing the songs that need to be heard.
[01:13:08.406 --> 01:13:10.726]  But there's so many people out there that are just scared.
[01:13:11.207 --> 01:13:13.167]  And you can't be half-hearted about this.
[01:13:13.367 --> 01:13:14.848]  Just go all in.
[01:13:15.428 --> 01:13:16.828]  And become a hero, man.
[01:13:16.848 --> 01:13:17.929]  I love this!
[01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:29.914]  Street benches where you had Bernie and it says free on one bench and Bernie and then on the other one it says a cuss word that deals with bull hockey or Bravo Sierra.
[01:13:30.314 --> 01:13:37.020]  I mean it's just incredible how you can with just simple words illustrate the truth and it's so true on its face we understand it.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.042]  I'm glad you raised that Sabo because
[01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:47.967]  They're having congressional hearings live right now with Diamonds and Silk, who are just positive, libertarian, pro-free market ladies that want change.
[01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:50.708]  And they've got hundreds of millions of views on YouTube.
[01:13:50.728 --> 01:13:51.748]  They're all over Fox News.
[01:13:51.768 --> 01:13:52.728]  They're all over this show.
[01:13:53.289 --> 01:13:56.229]  And they're getting shadow banned on YouTube and Twitter and Facebook.
[01:13:56.529 --> 01:13:57.290]  And it's all admitted.
[01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:03.071]  And Congress is having live hearings asking, are tech giants censoring conservatives?
[01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:04.872]  Well, again, we're not really conservatives in my view.
[01:14:06.112 --> 01:14:08.734]  People that want to have Americana and free market.
[01:14:08.974 --> 01:14:10.555]  That's been the punk.
[01:14:10.695 --> 01:14:13.337]  That's been the rock and roll for the last 500 years.
[01:14:13.377 --> 01:14:23.805]  That's been what's given us space travel and medicine and science and longer lives, was getting away from feudalism, but communism and socialism and liberalism, it's just forms of control.
[01:14:24.225 --> 01:14:26.507]  And so they had a big Comedy Central show attacking Paul Watson.
[01:14:26.527 --> 01:14:27.427]  We're going to play it next hour.
[01:14:28.428 --> 01:14:30.909]  Saying, hey, you're not the new punk rock conservatives.
[01:14:31.329 --> 01:14:33.630]  You know, look, the Republicans control the central government.
[01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:35.171]  That's not who we're talking about.
[01:14:35.191 --> 01:14:37.311]  We're talking about the universities, the media.
[01:14:37.551 --> 01:14:39.012]  We're talking about academia.
[01:14:39.172 --> 01:14:49.636]  We're talking about the big corporations, almost to a company, are anti-freedom, anti-free market, because that gives you individual freedom, and that is the real avant-garde.
[01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:49.896]  Ben?
[01:14:51.277 --> 01:15:01.623]  Well, you mentioned the word sanctimonious, Alex, and I had a chance to talk with Sabo in some depth today, and we're really in alignment.
[01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:02.703]  We're comrades in arms.
[01:15:02.743 --> 01:15:13.629]  Now, you might be in L.A., and I might be up in the boonies of Montana, surrounded by deer and wild turkey, but we both agree, I'm just amazed at how we're such in alignment, even though we come from totally different environments.
[01:15:13.649 --> 01:15:15.010]  That's why I wanted to get you guys together.
[01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:19.633]  But what you do so well, and what I try to do in a different manner, but what you do so well,
[01:15:20.553 --> 01:15:22.254]  Is Alex Mitchell worth sanctimonious?
[01:15:23.055 --> 01:15:25.017]  You're mocking their sanctimony!
[01:15:25.177 --> 01:15:30.441]  And they can't stand that, because these people, these virtue-signalers, they think they have a moral high ground.
[01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:40.488]  And when they see, when you show these images that crystallize the satire into this devastating image of them that tears them down, they cannot stand that.
[01:15:40.888 --> 01:15:42.249]  And so they try to silence us.
[01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:44.171]  And when they get mad, you know you're effective.
[01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:47.934]  And that's, when I draw a cartoon that makes a lot of people mad, I say, yeah.
[01:15:48.494 --> 01:15:49.615]  Because that's what I want to do.
[01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:52.157]  I want to sock him in the gut, visually, with a cartoon.
[01:15:52.177 --> 01:15:52.497]  That's right.
[01:15:52.537 --> 01:15:55.019]  Because when you get socked in the gut, you remember.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:55.460]  That's right.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.000]  You remember that.
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.162]  Ben Garrison, Sabo, stay there.
[01:15:58.182 --> 01:16:01.805]  A couple of the top artists in the world right now in studio with us.
[01:16:03.246 --> 01:16:09.874]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[01:16:10.555 --> 01:16:12.357]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[01:16:12.957 --> 01:16:18.824]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[01:16:19.225 --> 01:16:21.848]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[01:16:22.128 --> 01:16:25.150]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:31.434]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[01:16:32.074 --> 01:16:38.618]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[01:16:38.918 --> 01:16:44.821]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[01:16:45.282 --> 01:16:48.884]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[01:16:49.384 --> 01:16:57.589]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[01:16:57.989 --> 01:17:04.233]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:05.274 --> 01:17:09.697]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[01:17:10.318 --> 01:17:18.424]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[01:17:18.984 --> 01:17:20.645]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[01:17:21.206 --> 01:17:28.131]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[01:17:28.171 --> 01:17:31.193]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[01:17:31.773 --> 01:17:32.674]  It's not absorbable.
[01:17:33.054 --> 01:17:33.615]  It's toxic.
[01:17:34.315 --> 01:17:46.407]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[01:17:46.547 --> 01:17:49.069]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:58.175]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs.
[01:17:58.375 --> 01:18:02.338]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[01:18:02.758 --> 01:18:07.401]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[01:18:08.041 --> 01:18:11.605]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[01:18:11.885 --> 01:18:15.789]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:19.112]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[01:18:19.132 --> 01:18:20.274]  We have a good supply right now.
[01:18:20.674 --> 01:18:22.055]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[01:18:22.476 --> 01:18:24.778]  But this may be the clincher.
[01:18:24.818 --> 01:18:28.022]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[01:18:28.442 --> 01:18:31.845]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[01:18:32.305 --> 01:18:35.368]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago, it's not an issue.
[01:18:35.428 --> 01:18:36.148]  And we do get more.
[01:18:36.489 --> 01:18:43.875]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[01:18:44.175 --> 01:18:47.818]  Survival Shield X2 at mfulworthstore.com, mfulworthslife.com.
[01:18:48.118 --> 01:18:50.941]  And you've got to experience what having the good halogen in your body does.
[01:18:51.421 --> 01:18:54.163]  Most folks, in about three weeks, go through a detoxification process.
[01:18:54.864 --> 01:18:56.786]  But what it does is for stamina, libido,
[01:18:57.686 --> 01:18:59.328]  Focus energy is really amazing.
[01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:06.517]  And if you don't have true iodine, pure iodine, you will end up having all sorts of disorders, just like water, just like oxygen.
[01:19:06.817 --> 01:19:08.940]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.562]  It's available exclusively.
[01:19:10.842 --> 01:19:14.787]  Survival Shield X2 at mfulworthslife.com and mfulworthstore.com.
[01:19:14.847 --> 01:19:16.128]  And I hope, like a few years ago,
[01:19:17.225 --> 01:19:17.365]  That's
[01:19:37.142 --> 01:19:37.462]  I think so.
[01:20:06.286 --> 01:20:08.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:31.886]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars, and in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios
[01:20:31.886 --> 01:20:32.547]  We're good to go.
[01:20:51.745 --> 01:20:55.388]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[01:20:55.928 --> 01:21:07.436]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[01:21:08.536 --> 01:21:17.723]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[01:21:17.863 --> 01:21:19.143]  Demand truth.
[01:21:19.244 --> 01:21:20.965]  Demand InfoWars.
[01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:30.853]  And we've got two great artists here in studio with us.
[01:21:30.873 --> 01:21:41.642]  I want to make this point because it's critical and it's that if we don't all engage in our free speech right now,
[01:21:42.978 --> 01:21:46.780]  We're not going to have to wait for future generations to lose their speech.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:52.162]  Everyone is basically going to end up losing their free speech.
[01:21:52.202 --> 01:21:52.762]  This is it.
[01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:54.603]  It's premeditated.
[01:21:55.403 --> 01:21:56.024]  It's happening.
[01:21:56.064 --> 01:21:58.305]  But we've got congressional hearings going today.
[01:21:59.085 --> 01:22:00.807]  We've got the president talking about it.
[01:22:01.247 --> 01:22:04.110]  The universities being these anti-free speech command bases.
[01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:06.592]  The corporations funding anti-free speech.
[01:22:06.632 --> 01:22:10.976]  The communist Chinese government funding every major public school in the country.
[01:22:11.357 --> 01:22:13.158]  Many of them the number one funder.
[01:22:13.699 --> 01:22:15.000]  We force that out in the news.
[01:22:16.101 --> 01:22:19.444]  And they teach at UT that Falun Gong should not be allowed on campus.
[01:22:21.667 --> 01:22:22.908]  That's in the news this week!
[01:22:24.192 --> 01:22:25.832]  You understand the magnitude of that?
[01:22:26.053 --> 01:22:28.733]  They kill those Buddhists and take their organs.
[01:22:29.053 --> 01:22:32.154]  We're talking body snatching is being taught at UT.
[01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:36.776]  But again, we have no immune system to communism in this country because we haven't gone through it.
[01:22:37.176 --> 01:22:43.197]  And so we're now facing real authoritarianism, big mega rich funding communism as a way to bring down society.
[01:22:43.938 --> 01:22:45.498]  So now, let's go to camera two.
[01:22:46.178 --> 01:22:50.199]  I want to just thank these guys for being here in studio with us and coming here.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.020]  And I want to thank
[01:22:53.274 --> 01:22:56.878]  Ben Garrison, who is the number one editorial cartoonist in the world.
[01:22:56.918 --> 01:22:58.900]  Because I've been in news for 23 years.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.081]  I've followed it all.
[01:23:00.201 --> 01:23:00.962]  I look at it all.
[01:23:01.022 --> 01:23:04.946]  His stuff is more prolific than anybody out there times three or four.
[01:23:05.207 --> 01:23:06.708]  And there's some other amazing people.
[01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:08.250]  But he is more prolific.
[01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:09.571]  It's more powerful.
[01:23:09.692 --> 01:23:10.693]  It's more continuous.
[01:23:10.733 --> 01:23:11.213]  It's amazing.
[01:23:11.473 --> 01:23:13.496]  And the number one street artist in the world.
[01:23:13.976 --> 01:23:22.949]  When it comes to real freedom of expression is Sabo and the amazing, dangerous, cutting-edge, true avant-garde, true punk rock.
[01:23:23.109 --> 01:23:25.011]  And again, next hour we're going to air a report.
[01:23:26.072 --> 01:23:33.998]  From Paul Watson, where he got attacked by Comedy Central, Sumner Redstone, saying, oh, you say conservatism is avant-garde and punk rock.
[01:23:34.318 --> 01:23:39.622]  When we say punk rock, we mean how it was banned in the 60s and 70s, how it was blocked, the sex pistols.
[01:23:39.662 --> 01:23:42.384]  We don't mean literally, we're saying we're punk rock.
[01:23:42.665 --> 01:23:47.068]  We're saying we're being suppressed, we're being deplatformed, we're being censored, we're being attacked.
[01:23:47.328 --> 01:23:48.849]  And you call us all conservatives.
[01:23:48.869 --> 01:23:51.111]  They call me extremely conservative on Facebook.
[01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:52.132]  They list me.
[01:23:53.351 --> 01:23:54.592]  I'm really a lay historian.
[01:23:55.452 --> 01:23:57.753]  I've read more history books than most historians out there.
[01:23:57.893 --> 01:24:01.014]  And I'm a classical liberal in the Thomas Jeffersonian vein.
[01:24:01.535 --> 01:24:03.515]  I am, in many ways, socially liberal.
[01:24:04.036 --> 01:24:05.576]  But I'm pro-Second Amendment, pro-life.
[01:24:05.876 --> 01:24:09.218]  I'm just a nationalist populist that likes America, that likes Americana.
[01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.498]  You can call me a conservative, paleoconservative.
[01:24:11.658 --> 01:24:12.759]  These names mean nothing.
[01:24:13.119 --> 01:24:17.280]  But the modern liberals, by every definition, are the opposite of a classical liberal.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.260]  They're anti-free speech.
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:19.700]  They're anti-free market.
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:20.561]  They're anti-choice.
[01:24:20.761 --> 01:24:21.421]  They're monsters.
[01:24:21.561 --> 01:24:25.122]  And it's good to have in the arsenal Sabo and Ben Garrison.
[01:24:25.142 --> 01:24:27.262]  But here's why I've got them here for the next few days when we're going to be meeting.
[01:24:28.542 --> 01:24:34.764]  Just to brainstorm, and I want to ask them about this now, about how do we get people excited out there to do their own street art?
[01:24:35.823 --> 01:24:42.708]  In a continuum of what's totally legal versus what you've got to do in an emergency resistance move in case they really take our speech online.
[01:24:43.269 --> 01:24:45.010]  And the fact that they fear us getting on the street.
[01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:46.871]  That's in the WikiLeaks, that's in Google documents.
[01:24:47.191 --> 01:24:48.552]  They fear that final equation.
[01:24:48.893 --> 01:24:50.354]  So they've got Antifa trying to intimidate us.
[01:24:50.994 --> 01:24:55.976]  And how do we ignite that engine of the millions of listeners out there to do it?
[01:24:56.016 --> 01:25:07.262]  Whether it's one little sign on a pole, or whether it's a billboard on the side of their barn, or a bumper sticker on their car, or them starting their own website, or their own podcast, or putting up their own street art.
[01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:13.645]  That continuum, I've already been ranting in the segment, Ben Garrison and then again Sabo, what are your ideas?
[01:25:13.685 --> 01:25:20.308]  What is your grassroots initiative to give them, the listeners, the Promethean fire that both of you have when it comes to amazing art?
[01:25:20.856 --> 01:25:22.637]  I just have to say, just start.
[01:25:23.417 --> 01:25:30.800]  You're going to suck at first, and you're going to suck again, but trust me, after a while, you're going to produce something and you're going to go, wow, that's good.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:39.164]  And the reason it's important to start now is because this is going to be a generational fight, a multi-generational fight.
[01:25:40.004 --> 01:25:45.652]  And it's nice being on the ground level, but we have a long fight ahead of us.
[01:25:46.113 --> 01:25:51.059]  We're taking on the magazines, we're taking on Hollywood, we're taking on the social networking, everything.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.866]  So, like I said, it's going to suck at first, but for God's sakes, take that first step.
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:01.023]  Well, I've been trying to get young people to start drawing cartoons, too.
[01:26:01.243 --> 01:26:05.006]  I mean, especially female conservative cartoonists.
[01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:07.408]  There are no female conservative cartoonists out there.
[01:26:07.869 --> 01:26:14.474]  Finally, and Alex Jones showed my wife Tina's cartoon of the Slimer one.
[01:26:14.514 --> 01:26:16.175]  That was something my wife Tina did.
[01:26:16.195 --> 01:26:16.836]  That's really good.
[01:26:16.976 --> 01:26:19.238]  She's a cartoonist, too, and I finally got her
[01:26:20.034 --> 01:26:20.114]  to
[01:26:50.274 --> 01:26:52.216]  I don't mind if you do something illegal.
[01:26:52.736 --> 01:26:53.597]  Just don't get caught.
[01:26:53.637 --> 01:26:54.497]  See, if you don't get caught...
[01:27:08.368 --> 01:27:09.148]  It's not illegal.
[01:27:09.188 --> 01:27:10.209]  By the way, we're in a war.
[01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:11.450]  They're trying to silence us.
[01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:14.791]  The French Resistance went up on billboards in World War II and put stuff up there.
[01:27:14.811 --> 01:27:16.292]  We're being occupied by the globalists.
[01:27:16.592 --> 01:27:19.313]  They're having antifa hit us in the head with bike locks to shut us up.
[01:27:19.573 --> 01:27:25.656]  So we can climb up at night and put a message out on one of these corporate billboards, especially an empty one.
[01:27:25.996 --> 01:27:27.557]  I don't see anything bad about that.
[01:27:27.697 --> 01:27:28.838]  You've got to cross the line.
[01:27:28.858 --> 01:27:29.738]  He's a line crosser.
[01:27:29.758 --> 01:27:32.059]  You've got to cross that line or you don't even know where the line is anymore.
[01:27:32.079 --> 01:27:32.379]  I'll say it.
[01:27:32.399 --> 01:27:36.001]  I've climbed up on billboards and I've just made a decision.
[01:27:36.041 --> 01:27:37.442]  I'm going to start tagging some stuff in Austin.
[01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:40.010]  Oh yeah, you know, I'm not happy with the job.
[01:27:40.611 --> 01:27:43.833]  I think I've got two things when I know I'm doing a good job.
[01:27:44.033 --> 01:27:45.655]  One, it scares the hell out of the client.
[01:27:46.155 --> 01:27:48.097]  And two, I know I'm going to go to hell for doing it.
[01:27:48.537 --> 01:27:50.638]  So it's like, I love crossing those lines.
[01:27:51.159 --> 01:27:55.682]  And I believe if you want to make a difference and if you want a good voice, you can't be half-hearted.
[01:27:55.702 --> 01:27:56.483]  You got to go all in.
[01:27:58.288 --> 01:28:01.450]  The left isn't going to love you, so quit trying to get love from them.
[01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:14.139]  It came out three months ago that in 2015, Soros funded $15 million, $16 million, his son ran it, with Blue Cities, with the police, to go out and try to get the general public to riot and burn things down.
[01:28:14.699 --> 01:28:16.561]  And, I mean, so they're burning things down.
[01:28:16.801 --> 01:28:18.362]  We're just saying, okay, there's a bench.
[01:28:18.642 --> 01:28:19.543]  Put something funny on it.
[01:28:20.043 --> 01:28:22.224]  Okay, where are our Soros's?
[01:28:22.564 --> 01:28:23.585]  That's what I want to know.
[01:28:23.605 --> 01:28:32.989]  You can't tell me that there's not one conservative in California that can't get me a three-car garage that I can't wreck havoc with on the West Coast.
[01:28:33.029 --> 01:28:36.091]  I'm no Soros, but the listeners are our Soros.
[01:28:36.531 --> 01:28:39.132]  When they support us and buy the products in 4Store, that's why you're here.
[01:28:39.152 --> 01:28:42.713]  We're going to talk about trying to finance our West Coast attack operation.
[01:28:43.173 --> 01:28:53.736]  Our operation with Ben and selling limited prints if you guys work here and right off your side as well to help us fund expanding this thing nationwide.
[01:28:53.796 --> 01:28:55.897]  Yes, we're showing our hand right now.
[01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:57.417]  We're going into the Death Star.
[01:28:57.678 --> 01:28:58.498]  We're going to take it out.
[01:28:58.538 --> 01:28:58.958]  Stay with us.
[01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:04.989]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:09.192]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:29:09.592 --> 01:29:12.553]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:29:12.933 --> 01:29:14.914]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:19.837]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:29:20.197 --> 01:29:22.279]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:29:22.539 --> 01:29:29.005]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:29:29.565 --> 01:29:36.731]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:29:37.752 --> 01:29:42.416]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:29:42.816 --> 01:29:49.822]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:29:50.462 --> 01:29:54.906]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[01:29:55.366 --> 01:29:58.288]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:30:02.131 --> 01:30:09.799]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:14.744]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:30:15.264 --> 01:30:17.607]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:30:18.387 --> 01:30:21.511]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:30:23.024 --> 01:30:35.152]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:30:35.852 --> 01:30:50.902]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:30:51.903 --> 01:30:55.608]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[01:30:56.169 --> 01:30:57.871]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:30:57.911 --> 01:31:00.154]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[01:31:02.171 --> 01:31:03.633]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:31:03.773 --> 01:31:06.195]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[01:31:06.375 --> 01:31:13.662]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:31:13.862 --> 01:31:24.192]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:31:24.492 --> 01:31:32.055]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[01:31:32.335 --> 01:31:42.299]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:44.460]  And this part is most important.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:51.023]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standards.
[01:31:51.403 --> 01:31:52.486]  That means it's clean.
[01:31:52.846 --> 01:31:53.768]  That means it's pure.
[01:31:53.969 --> 01:31:56.774]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:31:56.874 --> 01:31:59.640]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.323]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:32:02.765 --> 01:32:03.486]  I'm so excited.
[01:32:03.506 --> 01:32:13.132]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:32:13.712 --> 01:32:18.896]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:32:19.216 --> 01:32:22.018]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:32:22.238 --> 01:32:30.984]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:32:33.105 --> 01:32:52.190]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:53.990]  It is amazing!
[01:32:55.391 --> 01:33:00.352]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:33:06.275 --> 01:33:10.478]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:20.323 --> 01:33:26.307]  Big Brother Mainstream Media Government Cover-Ups
[01:33:27.777 --> 01:33:28.739]  You want answers?
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.702]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:31.624 --> 01:33:38.014]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.582 --> 01:33:47.125]  Ladies and gentlemen, I know my plan, which is just a basic historic plan that's already worked before, will take down the globalists.
[01:33:47.305 --> 01:33:52.408]  We're going to talk about that here in just a moment, because if you support us, we're going to do it.
[01:33:52.428 --> 01:33:56.609]  We've gotten over a hundred new TV affiliates in just the last six months.
[01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:57.830]  We're on more satellites.
[01:33:58.930 --> 01:34:00.291]  We're reaching so many new people.
[01:34:00.311 --> 01:34:03.693]  They are blocking us more and more on the web, but thank God you're getting the information out.
[01:34:04.053 --> 01:34:08.675]  We're having congressional hearings about conservatives, populists, nationalists, Christians being
[01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:13.251]  Censored, Christian churches being persecuted by the IRS.
[01:34:13.671 --> 01:34:15.291]  I mean, this is real tyranny we're facing.
[01:34:16.551 --> 01:34:30.414]  And so I am just beyond excited right now to have Sabo and Ben Garrison, two of the most successful, just pro-common sense activists, artists in the world, in studios.
[01:34:30.434 --> 01:34:31.654]  We're going to go back to them in just a moment.
[01:34:32.534 --> 01:34:35.155]  But talking about financing this operation.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:40.201]  I want to boost what everybody's doing, just like we boosted Trump's campaign.
[01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:47.062]  You, the audience, are the engine, the brains, the guts, the blood, the sweat, the tears, the soul of this operation.
[01:34:48.302 --> 01:35:04.706]  And if you go to infowarstore.com and look at the water filtration, the air filtration, the non-GMO heirloom seeds, the books, the videos, the Patriot apparel, all of it, hundreds of t-shirts, dozens of ball caps,
[01:35:06.584 --> 01:35:15.829]  When you buy those products, you support the information war, but plus, you're wearing an InfoWars shirt, you wear it in a deep blue state area, you might get hit in the head with a tire iron or something, but you wear it everywhere else.
[01:35:15.849 --> 01:35:18.471]  You get your lunch bought for you, you might meet your wife, your husband, whatever.
[01:35:18.831 --> 01:35:22.053]  This is how we just do these little things that move mountains.
[01:35:22.373 --> 01:35:23.734]  That's why the left wants to bully us.
[01:35:24.174 --> 01:35:31.279]  Even The Hill and Town Hall have articles out today about how the left is bullying and attacking and threatening, and people are starting to stand up and fight back.
[01:35:31.299 --> 01:35:33.280]  Well, you do it by wearing t-shirts, by wearing
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:34.540]  Ball caps.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.001]  You do it by having a bumper sticker.
[01:35:36.121 --> 01:35:39.622]  All the orders that come in to InfoWars have five bumper stickers.
[01:35:39.702 --> 01:35:42.423]  I'm doubling it to ten in every order.
[01:35:43.803 --> 01:35:49.125]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the supplement page or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:49.385 --> 01:35:56.248]  Super Mel Vitality is just well-known, concentrated, organic herbs that are cold-pressed.
[01:35:56.288 --> 01:35:59.469]  That's the key for stamina, libido, energy, you name it.
[01:35:59.509 --> 01:36:00.029]  People love it.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.883]  Uh, you also, that's 50% off right now.
[01:36:03.344 --> 01:36:04.826]  You can also get the real red pill.
[01:36:05.146 --> 01:36:05.627]  Read about it.
[01:36:05.647 --> 01:36:06.588]  I don't have time to get to it.
[01:36:06.608 --> 01:36:07.129]  It's amazing.
[01:36:07.449 --> 01:36:10.453]  That goes with the Super Male and Super Female Vitality like a horse and carriage.
[01:36:11.515 --> 01:36:13.097]  It is 50% off.
[01:36:14.299 --> 01:36:16.882]  Get the two together and get free shipping!
[01:36:17.694 --> 01:36:19.535]  On Monday, it's going to have to end in a week.
[01:36:39.039 --> 01:36:41.961]  We also have a special on the super high quality MyPatriot Supply.
[01:36:42.141 --> 01:36:47.584]  Three months supply with a free Alexa Pure 200 plus dollar value free water filter.
[01:36:49.815 --> 01:36:51.856]  And yes, they had a C-SPAN thing with David Hogg a month ago.
[01:36:51.876 --> 01:36:54.798]  He goes, and Jones says the water's got toxins in it.
[01:36:55.098 --> 01:36:57.739]  And then the same video, then he has an ad for water filters.
[01:36:58.179 --> 01:36:58.740]  Interesting.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.981]  And they go, ooh, yeah, scam.
[01:37:01.921 --> 01:37:03.722]  No, the water table's full of poison.
[01:37:04.122 --> 01:37:04.943]  Everybody knows that.
[01:37:05.023 --> 01:37:05.563]  It's admitted.
[01:37:05.923 --> 01:37:07.744]  You need to filter your water, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:07.764 --> 01:37:09.065]  We have the best gravity-filled systems.
[01:37:09.325 --> 01:37:11.146]  So yes, I do a report on how the water's bad.
[01:37:11.626 --> 01:37:15.148]  And then I sell a water filter I use when I'm on the road or in my own home.
[01:37:15.548 --> 01:37:15.908]  Yeah.
[01:37:17.489 --> 01:37:17.989]  Exactly.
[01:37:19.952 --> 01:37:21.473]  Open a franchise of a restaurant.
[01:37:22.833 --> 01:37:28.575]  If I was a franchisee, I would find a restaurant that I loved, that was successful, and had really good food, that I would want to franchise.
[01:37:29.015 --> 01:37:30.836]  I'd say, can I franchise your great restaurant?
[01:37:31.176 --> 01:37:35.958]  A lot of people have gone in famously to good restaurants, and they've said, I want to franchise this.
[01:37:36.598 --> 01:37:37.218]  Exactly!
[01:37:37.458 --> 01:37:40.539]  I sell what I use, and I like, and I believe in.
[01:37:40.959 --> 01:37:43.080]  But it shows Hogg, and the media thinks it's like a scam.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:47.902]  He had a water filter ad after he talked about atrazine in the water causing sterility.
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:49.280]  Dun, dun, dun.
[01:37:49.441 --> 01:37:50.541]  Like, oh my God, it's hidden!
[01:37:50.561 --> 01:37:51.982]  They always go, Jones said this on air.
[01:37:52.022 --> 01:37:52.623]  We caught it.
[01:37:52.703 --> 01:37:53.083]  Here it is.
[01:37:53.363 --> 01:37:54.544]  It was a big secret.
[01:37:54.925 --> 01:37:55.845]  Millions were watching it.
[01:37:56.346 --> 01:37:57.847]  So, MFullWarStore.com.
[01:37:57.867 --> 01:38:03.912]  Now let's talk about supporting these guys, because I'm going to try to work with them to do limited prints of their work and get it out to fund their operation.
[01:38:03.932 --> 01:38:05.373]  I want to get other artists involved.
[01:38:05.413 --> 01:38:06.393]  I want to do this for years.
[01:38:06.433 --> 01:38:06.914]  I haven't done it.
[01:38:06.994 --> 01:38:07.975]  I want to launch something big.
[01:38:07.995 --> 01:38:11.277]  They're here to brainstorm with me to be part of that and many others.
[01:38:11.757 --> 01:38:14.800]  But Ben Garrison, GRRRGraphics.com.
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:17.202]  Sabo, UnsavoryAgents.com.
[01:38:18.339 --> 01:38:21.300]  We sell one of his little coffee table books of some of his best art of the election.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.580]  But man, the stuff is so good.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.361]  I want to have big coffee table books.
[01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:29.622]  I want to put out limited prints of what Sabo's doing to put it on my walls at my office.
[01:38:29.642 --> 01:38:33.623]  We already got Ben-Gurion's stuff here for six, seven years up on our walls.
[01:38:33.643 --> 01:38:34.584]  That's how big a fan I am.
[01:38:34.924 --> 01:38:39.345]  So let's just briefly talk about you guys and some of the great art you have.
[01:38:39.405 --> 01:38:42.046]  Because if you read the Clinton Foundation, not their big
[01:38:42.546 --> 01:38:48.681]  Corporate one, but their private library foundation, Judicial Watch and World Net Daily sued four years ago and got the documents.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:39:09.206]  They were saying in 2000 and... they were saying in 2000... no, no, in 1993, they were saying we've got to shut down any libertarian conservative or any other liberal groups that are organic, that have their own economy, their own products, books, newspapers, magazines, films, because that'll create their new culture.
[01:39:09.226 --> 01:39:09.926]  They understood that.
[01:39:09.986 --> 01:39:15.328]  So doing this and creating economic systems and ecosystems is how we defeat them.
[01:39:15.348 --> 01:39:16.688]  So let's... I want to get your views on that.
[01:39:17.813 --> 01:39:27.156]  Well, you remember that Hillary famously said, I think it was in the 90s, about the time you alluded to, that the internet needed an editor.
[01:39:27.176 --> 01:39:29.557]  Well, guess who the editor would be?
[01:39:29.577 --> 01:39:32.979]  It would be, well, of course, people like Hillary Clinton.
[01:39:33.319 --> 01:39:36.220]  And what they want is a Chinese-style censorship.
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:40.121]  In which conservative voices are shut down.
[01:39:40.361 --> 01:39:45.464]  Oh, well, that's offensive, that's bullying, that's this, that, and the other, and you're not, you know, they pull the plug on us.
[01:39:45.524 --> 01:39:49.907]  And if you're in WikiLeaks, she was in there with all the papers and TV, actually like an editor herself and her staff.
[01:39:51.443 --> 01:39:51.984]  And guess what?
[01:39:52.024 --> 01:39:57.767]  You've got Zuckerberg, you know, basically kissing the butt of the Chinese dragon.
[01:39:57.807 --> 01:39:58.928]  He wants that here, too.
[01:39:58.988 --> 01:40:07.614]  He was really trying to butter Z up so he could get Facebook in China and get all kinds of... and get it limited.
[01:40:07.974 --> 01:40:10.056]  And these guys, I mean, come on.
[01:40:10.076 --> 01:40:14.318]  He goes to Hawaii and buys up 100 acres or so.
[01:40:14.358 --> 01:40:15.119]  And then what does he do?
[01:40:15.159 --> 01:40:16.620]  He first puts a big wall on it.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:17.781]  So he has his privacy.
[01:40:17.941 --> 01:40:18.841]  He grabbed 6,000 acres of native land.
[01:40:21.643 --> 01:40:27.525]  So he puts up, first thing he does, he wants to protect his privacy and he gets to put a big giant wall up around his property.
[01:40:28.285 --> 01:40:30.726]  But we get no privacy whatsoever.
[01:40:31.126 --> 01:40:32.806]  We're exposed and we're for sale.
[01:40:33.206 --> 01:40:34.907]  That's the hypocrisy.
[01:40:34.927 --> 01:40:35.527]  We gave them that.
[01:40:35.567 --> 01:40:36.747]  We're asleep at the switch.
[01:40:37.127 --> 01:40:41.769]  We're too busy camping out, having barbecues, and they were too busy taking over everything.
[01:40:41.809 --> 01:40:46.310]  I mean, we have to start infiltrating these schools and every other damn thing the way they do.
[01:40:46.930 --> 01:41:16.150]  Well, that's one reason I'm drawing the cartoons is I want to shake people out of their apathy and Here's the advantage of art over you know written or spoken words the words tend to appeal to the left brain and the rationality of everything but Art is a strong irrational Component to it and when you combine rational with irrational if you can do that and get it nicely balanced
[01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:27.217]  Then you've got something that's memorable and too many, you know, in this world today we're just inundated with visual noise constantly and information noise too.
[01:41:27.597 --> 01:41:38.144]  So if you could produce a work of art that is memorable, and I'm not talking about just illustrating a headline or just going for a cheap gag, you know, I don't want to do a cartoon like that.
[01:41:38.184 --> 01:41:40.246]  Not staunch, but really thought-provoking.
[01:41:40.646 --> 01:41:48.111]  Yeah, well, you have to use a lot of different components and have some mention to the work of art for it to be memorable.
[01:41:48.591 --> 01:41:51.673]  One of them is irony, for example.
[01:41:51.713 --> 01:41:53.194]  You mentioned David Hogg.
[01:41:53.214 --> 01:41:55.395]  Well, I did a cartoon of him, and I showed him.
[01:41:56.136 --> 01:42:00.999]  I decided to portray him as something that he hates, so-called assault weapons.
[01:42:01.319 --> 01:42:05.321]  So I drew him as an assault weapon, and instead of bang-bang, he's saying ban-ban.
[01:42:05.822 --> 01:42:07.283]  So that's the way you get at him.
[01:42:07.443 --> 01:42:08.603]  And then people remembered that.
[01:42:08.643 --> 01:42:09.364]  That was a big hit.
[01:42:09.824 --> 01:42:12.206]  Yeah, that's on Ben Garrison's site right now.
[01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:14.007]  Let's pull that up or we can do search engine.
[01:42:14.948 --> 01:42:15.508]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:42:15.568 --> 01:42:15.809]  Boom.
[01:42:16.249 --> 01:42:20.452]  Yeah, so people wrote me and they thought this really just devastates him.
[01:42:20.772 --> 01:42:26.577]  Because, and the irony again, is you turn him... Well, he's been calling for our speech to be taken too, Sabo.
[01:42:27.758 --> 01:42:28.959]  I love that kid, man.
[01:42:29.279 --> 01:42:34.663]  It's like he's in high school and there's nothing I love more than remembering what I was like when I was in high school.
[01:42:34.943 --> 01:42:40.688]  He's got the whole rest of his life to look back on and realize how much of a douche he was when he was a kid.
[01:42:41.529 --> 01:42:42.750]  Look at, my God.
[01:42:42.770 --> 01:42:45.132]  You talk about sanctimonious, man.
[01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:46.032]  Him and Comey.
[01:42:48.574 --> 01:42:51.197]  My private parts are thicker than his arms.
[01:42:52.133 --> 01:42:53.575]  Something's going on there.
[01:42:53.595 --> 01:42:54.876]  He needs some red pills.
[01:42:54.896 --> 01:42:55.397]  That's what he needs.
[01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:56.298]  Damn right.
[01:42:56.358 --> 01:42:58.681]  I'm gonna send him a free bottle of red pills.
[01:42:58.701 --> 01:42:59.422]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:59.462 --> 01:42:59.902]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.942 --> 01:43:00.844]  This is amazing.
[01:43:02.686 --> 01:43:05.008]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:43:05.029 --> 01:43:06.771]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:43:07.191 --> 01:43:10.014]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:43:11.101 --> 01:43:22.165]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[01:43:22.605 --> 01:43:31.668]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[01:43:32.208 --> 01:43:37.772]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[01:43:37.972 --> 01:43:43.135]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:45.397]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[01:43:45.697 --> 01:43:47.719]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[01:43:48.687 --> 01:43:51.789]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:43:51.989 --> 01:43:53.390]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:56.572]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:43:57.332 --> 01:43:59.293]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:43:59.854 --> 01:44:02.115]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[01:44:13.703 --> 01:44:22.767]  We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him and the free system that allowed it to happen in American history.
[01:44:23.267 --> 01:44:32.151]  From the highest levels of government to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us.
[01:44:32.711 --> 01:44:37.633]  But the ultimate insult is that they think we're so stupid that we'll let them get away with it.
[01:44:38.114 --> 01:44:54.441]  These saboteurs, slashing away with their leaks and sneers, their phony accusations and gagging sanctimony, drive their daggers through the heart of our future, poisoning our belief that honest custody of our institutions will ever again be possible.
[01:44:55.042 --> 01:44:59.084]  So they can then build their utopia from the ashes of what they burned down.
[01:44:59.784 --> 01:45:00.004]  No.
[01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:06.169]  Their fate will be failure, and they will perish in the political flames of their own fires.
[01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:13.215]  We are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedom's safest place.
[01:45:13.275 --> 01:45:15.937]  You know, I just heard that National Rifle Association ad.
[01:45:17.138 --> 01:45:20.961]  Airing on the radio side, TV side.
[01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:23.962]  We had a video ad going with Dana Lash.
[01:45:23.982 --> 01:45:25.163]  I always call her Losh.
[01:45:25.984 --> 01:45:26.924]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[01:45:27.084 --> 01:45:27.705]  Dana Lash.
[01:45:28.005 --> 01:45:29.646]  Great, smart, syndicated radio host.
[01:45:30.527 --> 01:45:30.987]  Great lady.
[01:45:31.547 --> 01:45:33.288]  Very successful spokesperson for the NRA.
[01:45:33.608 --> 01:45:38.051]  But the left wants to basically kill and says she's a witch and burn her, literally.
[01:45:39.672 --> 01:45:43.635]  They heard that ad running and Media Matters wrote stories about it.
[01:45:44.375 --> 01:45:45.496]  George Soros' outfit.
[01:45:46.601 --> 01:45:56.707]  Saying, oh look, the National Rifle Association's spending money with Alex Jones, like they're the arbiter, they're the boss, they're the god, and ooh, if they say it's bad, it's bad.
[01:45:57.347 --> 01:45:58.327]  No, morons.
[01:45:59.088 --> 01:46:00.088]  I like that ad.
[01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:05.191]  So, I have part of the radio ads on the network, so I run that ad.
[01:46:05.511 --> 01:46:07.813]  Even though one of those ads is about $1,000 a minute, I run it.
[01:46:07.873 --> 01:46:09.073]  And eat $1,000 every time.
[01:46:09.914 --> 01:46:10.774]  Comprende?
[01:46:17.824 --> 01:46:18.404]  Figure that out?
[01:46:19.265 --> 01:46:20.726]  So you guys don't get it, do you?
[01:46:21.467 --> 01:46:22.828]  I'm not doing this for money.
[01:46:23.489 --> 01:46:25.010]  I'm not doing this for myself.
[01:46:25.691 --> 01:46:28.994]  I don't sit there and calculate the work I do about me personally.
[01:46:29.354 --> 01:46:31.336]  It's about my children and the future.
[01:46:32.016 --> 01:46:32.957]  I'm a kamikaze.
[01:46:33.898 --> 01:46:35.780]  I don't care what you do to me financially.
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:37.401]  I don't care how you come after me.
[01:46:37.581 --> 01:46:38.482]  I'm committed.
[01:46:39.022 --> 01:46:42.866]  Because I know you're bad people and I want to get you off of our collective backs.
[01:46:45.706 --> 01:46:49.009]  Isn't that something you can now understand, dumbos?
[01:46:52.833 --> 01:46:58.799]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:05.726 --> 01:47:08.389]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.959 --> 01:47:37.905]  Ben Garrison, Sabo, they're in studio, and I'm telling you folks, we create whole sites with free downloads in HD to put posters up, how-to's, you know, support people's art, support other young artists, old artists, female artists, and just make it about
[01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:40.626]  Street art, like they did in ancient Rome.
[01:47:40.686 --> 01:47:42.768]  That was the internet of Rome, was street art.
[01:47:43.088 --> 01:47:47.391]  And the government was always trying to get rid of the graffiti, but that's how the people actually communicated.
[01:47:47.651 --> 01:47:50.993]  And I'm saying, under an authoritarian regime, you hit the streets.
[01:47:51.774 --> 01:47:53.114]  And in this way, boom, it's up.
[01:47:53.455 --> 01:47:54.335]  Boom, people see it.
[01:47:54.455 --> 01:47:55.376]  Boom, it has an effect.
[01:47:55.836 --> 01:47:56.957]  Don't do it on somebody's business.
[01:47:56.997 --> 01:47:57.978]  Don't do it on, you know, whatever.
[01:47:58.138 --> 01:48:00.880]  There's all sorts of places to do it, or do it on your own car.
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:06.603]  But it doesn't hurt anything to put up a nice printed sticker that fits right, that peels off onto a park bench.
[01:48:07.044 --> 01:48:08.705]  Then take photos, put it on the internet.
[01:48:09.285 --> 01:48:10.046]  It goes viral.
[01:48:10.307 --> 01:48:11.107]  People there see it.
[01:48:11.187 --> 01:48:16.133]  It's about interfacing the real third dimension with silicon.
[01:48:16.613 --> 01:48:19.977]  And so that's what Sabo and Ben Garrison are talking about.
[01:48:20.397 --> 01:48:24.562]  Sabo, you were making some key points during the break, and then Ben was making some really key points.
[01:48:24.802 --> 01:48:25.223]  Go ahead, Sabo.
[01:48:26.365 --> 01:48:27.786]  Be political with your art, man.
[01:48:27.806 --> 01:48:30.166]  There's nothing I hate more than just beautiful wallpaper.
[01:48:30.967 --> 01:48:36.809]  And what I love about what I do is how quickly it gets taken down.
[01:48:36.849 --> 01:48:43.351]  It forces me to come up with other ways of doing it, like hanging them up on power lines or putting them behind installations.
[01:48:44.772 --> 01:48:45.932]  Don't touch both the power lines.
[01:48:45.972 --> 01:48:46.973]  Don't go up the power lines, folks.
[01:48:46.993 --> 01:48:48.054]  You're not messing the power lines.
[01:48:48.574 --> 01:48:51.336]  But I can tell you, I grew up thinking that the left loved art.
[01:48:51.396 --> 01:48:52.837]  You're not supposed to censor art.
[01:48:52.857 --> 01:48:54.578]  You're supposed to appreciate all art.
[01:48:54.998 --> 01:48:58.641]  It's like, if that's the case, why does my stuff only stay up on the street for an hour?
[01:48:58.761 --> 01:49:00.782]  Well, that's when they were using art to take over.
[01:49:01.562 --> 01:49:03.164]  And now they're like, no, no, no, no.
[01:49:03.184 --> 01:49:04.644]  We're with the Communist Chinese now.
[01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:05.345]  You don't get art.
[01:49:07.006 --> 01:49:07.406]  Well, this is...
[01:49:09.269 --> 01:49:11.072]  This is becoming a big problem, isn't it?
[01:49:11.152 --> 01:49:23.650]  I mean, the left wants to suppress free speech, and they want to offset it by giving people this lure, and the lure is free stuff.
[01:49:24.531 --> 01:49:30.496]  But let me tell you, this free stuff comes at the expense of freedom, and they don't seem to realize this.
[01:49:31.357 --> 01:49:35.780]  This republic we have is a very rare thing in the history of the world.
[01:49:36.421 --> 01:49:41.145]  It's something that's very dear and needs to be protected, and we shouldn't just be
[01:49:42.441 --> 01:49:42.621]  Just
[01:49:59.984 --> 01:50:01.585]  The things that Bernie Sanders says.
[01:50:01.685 --> 01:50:08.787]  I despise the people who want us to give up our liberty and exchange it for security.
[01:50:08.987 --> 01:50:11.688]  We have to stop being afraid of losing our stuff.
[01:50:12.268 --> 01:50:19.190]  I mean, I'm somebody that, you know, I had a house, I had savings, I made bad investments, and I ended up going haywire, and next thing you know, I lost it all.
[01:50:19.210 --> 01:50:19.690]  And you know what?
[01:50:19.730 --> 01:50:20.630]  It's not that bad.
[01:50:20.650 --> 01:50:23.571]  I started over, and I had help.
[01:50:23.671 --> 01:50:24.792]  I had a lot of help from people.
[01:50:24.812 --> 01:50:28.013]  When I saw my cartoons, we started getting supporters on Patreon.
[01:50:28.053 --> 01:50:28.373]  I was like,
[01:50:29.093 --> 01:50:32.116]  I was like humbled, but also just amazed and excited.
[01:50:32.136 --> 01:50:37.562]  And we got a guy who came to us and said, you know, let me do your website for you.
[01:50:37.602 --> 01:50:39.984]  So we got a man, our webmaster.
[01:50:40.004 --> 01:50:40.565]  That's beautiful.
[01:50:40.825 --> 01:50:42.366]  Eric in Ohio.
[01:50:42.467 --> 01:50:44.168]  And we're building a community.
[01:50:44.208 --> 01:50:45.349]  We're building a culture.
[01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:46.310]  And now we have a...
[01:50:48.012 --> 01:51:00.217]  An animator, Paco Labelle, in Montreal, who's animated my cartoons, and he's done such a fantastic job, and we got such a great response from that, so we're excited about doing more animation.
[01:51:00.237 --> 01:51:05.319]  They're shutting us down because we're popular, we're winning, and we are the future, our listeners are the future.
[01:51:05.619 --> 01:51:14.383]  You made a key point during the break, and I want Sabo to comment on this, because you guys are on fire during the breaks, and you're doing great on air, but you're a little more subdued, obviously, here under the lights, but you were talking about
[01:51:15.583 --> 01:51:33.236]  Well, I have a friend in Germany who's about my age, and he and his family visited us in Montana about four years ago, but he is just livid, this endless, and he just despises Merkel, but he's livid at the endless
[01:51:34.476 --> 01:51:42.200]  Immigration into his country that's changing the very, you know, the very fiber of what German culture used to be.
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:49.283]  And we know that he's also afraid to speak out because you could be fined, you could be sent to jail.
[01:51:49.323 --> 01:51:51.764]  Look what they're doing to people, some people in England.
[01:51:51.784 --> 01:51:54.425]  They're fining them and jailing them just for having an opinion.
[01:51:54.485 --> 01:51:57.827]  We can't let that come to America because they want that to come here too.
[01:51:58.547 --> 01:52:13.384]  So everybody can do something and that's you know many years ago Alex Jones said that on air and I and I was thinking well yeah he's right I'm you know my dad was a World War II veteran he was in many battles what have I done nothing all I did was pay my taxes
[01:52:13.404 --> 01:52:17.847]  By the way, I'm very proud of the fact that you, when we first talked like six years ago, you said, I inspired you.
[01:52:18.387 --> 01:52:19.968]  And I've been a little bit brask.
[01:52:20.008 --> 01:52:20.749]  I've had my issues.
[01:52:20.789 --> 01:52:21.409]  I'm not perfect.
[01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:22.470]  Oh, I'm not either.
[01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:24.351]  But it's kind of like the squeaky wheel and everything.
[01:52:24.531 --> 01:52:25.372]  I've been a train wreck.
[01:52:25.792 --> 01:52:29.234]  But the train wreck, so many people I've talked to said, you inspired me.
[01:52:29.515 --> 01:52:31.056]  You already knew more than I knew in many ways.
[01:52:31.276 --> 01:52:33.957]  But I inspired you and others to take action.
[01:52:34.238 --> 01:52:35.158]  I'm most proud of that.
[01:52:35.178 --> 01:52:37.860]  I got a little bit late started, but it doesn't matter.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:38.601]  You've got to start.
[01:52:39.141 --> 01:52:40.362]  Everybody can do something.
[01:52:40.982 --> 01:52:49.568]  You know, even if you're just talking to your neighbor, just make everybody aware that, you know, we've got something very special and it needs to be protected.
[01:52:49.608 --> 01:52:52.169]  And that's our republic and our constitution.
[01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:55.692]  And I don't want to see that go away and be replaced by collectivism.
[01:52:56.472 --> 01:52:58.253]  Which always collapses.
[01:52:58.313 --> 01:52:59.174]  It's a nightmare.
[01:52:59.474 --> 01:53:04.496]  Well, right now they're trying to push naked democracy on us.
[01:53:04.936 --> 01:53:06.156]  And this really bothers me.
[01:53:06.476 --> 01:53:09.057]  I want everybody out there to start listening to what the left says.
[01:53:09.137 --> 01:53:10.377]  And they always say the same thing.
[01:53:10.537 --> 01:53:11.838]  Our democracy, our democracy.
[01:53:11.878 --> 01:53:12.678]  Hillary says it all the time.
[01:53:12.698 --> 01:53:20.380]  They want direct democracy, which means if 51% say, like Nazi Germany, Hitler was elected, we're going to kill this group, it happens.
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:22.161]  In a republic, you can't do that.
[01:53:22.321 --> 01:53:25.544]  Karl Marx said democracy is the road to socialism.
[01:53:25.664 --> 01:53:29.247]  They want to... and you listen to Bill Maher, for example.
[01:53:29.267 --> 01:53:31.650]  He wants to do away with the Electoral College.
[01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:32.610]  So does Hillary.
[01:53:32.670 --> 01:53:39.557]  They want the cities to have the primary voice over the rural areas.
[01:53:40.077 --> 01:53:41.038]  And I was thinking to myself...
[01:53:42.239 --> 01:53:49.686]  Our whole republic was based on having the cities and the rural balanced and not having a dominant, overpopulated state dominate a rural state.
[01:53:49.726 --> 01:53:49.906]  Right.
[01:53:49.946 --> 01:53:51.148]  We're the United States.
[01:53:51.208 --> 01:53:54.090]  We're not the United blob of Washington, D.C.
[01:53:54.611 --> 01:53:56.152]  We're not the United Coastal Elites.
[01:53:56.753 --> 01:53:57.153]  Exactly.
[01:53:57.433 --> 01:54:00.376]  So the states should have say.
[01:54:00.756 --> 01:54:02.919]  But Bill Maher says, well, why does Montana have
[01:54:03.679 --> 01:54:06.241]  They'd hardly have any people there at all, but they have two senators.
[01:54:06.261 --> 01:54:07.822]  Why does California have two senators?
[01:54:07.862 --> 01:54:09.843]  We should have a lot more senators than Montana.
[01:54:09.883 --> 01:54:10.504]  And let's explain.
[01:54:11.024 --> 01:54:16.488]  They've all got more House members, but for the Senate there's that check and balance on population.
[01:54:16.708 --> 01:54:17.889]  This is all super smart.
[01:54:18.209 --> 01:54:23.072]  Why should people in some super far away area be controlled by some far off king of England?
[01:54:24.293 --> 01:54:25.574]  We don't want to have this happen again.
[01:54:25.914 --> 01:54:27.195]  I'm tripping out on Germany.
[01:54:27.235 --> 01:54:28.416]  They've gone full circle.
[01:54:28.616 --> 01:54:36.621]  They went from the whole Hitler thing to, you can't say Hitler anymore, and now they're inviting all these people who hate Jews and want to kill Jews.
[01:54:36.681 --> 01:54:40.343]  Yeah, they're telling Jews in Germany and Sweden and everywhere, don't wear your yarmulkes.
[01:54:40.583 --> 01:54:42.244]  Yeah, so they've like gone full circle.
[01:54:42.284 --> 01:54:45.146]  So, welcome your new Nazis, Germany.
[01:54:46.206 --> 01:54:48.748]  I used to love, I was enamored by Europeans.
[01:54:48.808 --> 01:54:49.668]  I grew up in the country.
[01:54:49.688 --> 01:54:52.190]  I was like, you had a French or English accent.
[01:54:52.210 --> 01:54:52.810]  It was awesome.
[01:54:53.211 --> 01:54:55.452]  Now it's like, what happened to you people?
[01:54:55.572 --> 01:54:56.192]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[01:54:57.133 --> 01:55:00.256]  They had wars in Europe in the last 300 years that killed most of the population.
[01:55:00.276 --> 01:55:02.458]  And I'm sorry, a lot of wimps got left.
[01:55:02.478 --> 01:55:04.699]  I'm not saying all the men are wimps in Europe.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.821]  It's just people have been slapped down.
[01:55:06.841 --> 01:55:07.962]  It's just like they did what Hitler said.
[01:55:08.362 --> 01:55:12.946]  Look at this, a 74-year-old Swedish woman prosecuted for criticizing mass immigration.
[01:55:13.326 --> 01:55:17.409]  Well, I'm sorry, every Muslim country sided with Hitler in World War II.
[01:55:17.429 --> 01:55:20.212]  So you say, wow, why is Germany siding with Islam?
[01:55:20.492 --> 01:55:21.693]  Hitler sided with Islam.
[01:55:21.713 --> 01:55:22.774]  He didn't like Christianity.
[01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:28.554]  Yeah, if I ever get a dog, I'm going to teach him to zeig heil, just like that guy in the UK.
[01:55:29.996 --> 01:55:39.204]  Oh yeah, Count Dankula is like a libertarian liberal doing a joke that Charlie Chaplin could do, or John Cleese could do, but he's facing years in prison.
[01:55:39.244 --> 01:55:43.147]  He's been convicted, sentencing's coming up, for having a pug say, Heil Hitler.
[01:55:43.868 --> 01:55:50.353]  And they want to throw you in jail too, or some of them want to, like Al Gore wants to make sure that you get prosecuted for questioning his
[01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:53.353]  This climate change scandal.
[01:55:53.373 --> 01:55:54.656]  Or that he invented the damn internet!
[01:55:55.177 --> 01:55:57.721]  I had the Secret Service knock on my door for some tweets.
[01:55:58.282 --> 01:56:03.752]  It's like, I can't wait for them to bust my door down at 3 o'clock in the morning because I posted something on Facebook.
[01:56:05.233 --> 01:56:05.913]  It's incredible.
[01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:09.454]  But then, Madonna can say, I'm going to blow the White House up.
[01:56:09.514 --> 01:56:09.894]  It's okay.
[01:56:10.074 --> 01:56:14.476]  Yeah, you know, when I heard that the Secret Service came, they left a little door hanger.
[01:56:14.516 --> 01:56:16.076]  They said, oh, well, the Secret Service gives a call.
[01:56:16.616 --> 01:56:17.576]  I was scared at first.
[01:56:17.836 --> 01:56:19.417]  For like two seconds, I was scared.
[01:56:19.837 --> 01:56:21.938]  Then I said something about Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:56:22.278 --> 01:56:23.018]  I said, screw that.
[01:56:23.058 --> 01:56:25.279]  When they come back tomorrow, I went to Kinko's.
[01:56:25.319 --> 01:56:27.739]  I printed really big the word Oswald.
[01:56:28.079 --> 01:56:31.600]  And I literally papered my whole apartment with that word.
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.521]  I put my AR against the wall.
[01:56:34.421 --> 01:56:38.603]  And I opened the windows, I said, you guys can't come inside, but you can interview me from outside.
[01:56:39.003 --> 01:56:40.204]  And I had a blast.
[01:56:40.544 --> 01:56:41.104]  It was great.
[01:56:42.425 --> 01:56:43.286]  This is a good point, though.
[01:56:43.326 --> 01:56:44.766]  They want you to be in fear.
[01:56:44.786 --> 01:56:46.767]  I mean, this is the whole point of this.
[01:56:47.007 --> 01:56:48.868]  Yeah, they're trying to bully us.
[01:56:48.888 --> 01:56:49.889]  I don't know about everybody else.
[01:56:49.909 --> 01:56:51.970]  I'm not going to be bullied.
[01:56:53.779 --> 01:57:05.491]  Well, we started getting bullied in 1913 with the 16th Amendment when they started wanting to incriminate ourselves and sign our name to a form and give up direct taxes, which are unconstitutional.
[01:57:05.831 --> 01:57:09.455]  And this has gotten so bad now that we're working as slaves for the government.
[01:57:09.795 --> 01:57:10.855]  And that's what Kanye West is saying.
[01:57:10.875 --> 01:57:16.476]  He says, you're not going to use your threats of fear, you're not going to intimidate me to manipulate my free thought.
[01:57:16.516 --> 01:57:17.456]  That's his latest thing.
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:41.082]  Yo, I was here in Austin a couple weeks ago, and I was shocked.
[01:57:41.142 --> 01:57:42.783]  Three bars asked us to leave.
[01:57:42.823 --> 01:57:43.504]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:57:43.564 --> 01:57:48.127]  We were going to play this exclusive Kanye West UT interview we did with UT folks.
[01:57:48.367 --> 01:57:50.028]  We'll play that at the first five minutes of the next hour.
[01:57:50.048 --> 01:57:51.529]  We're going to come back and finish up in a moment.
[01:57:56.932 --> 01:58:05.701]  Infowars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[01:58:06.121 --> 01:58:13.488]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:58:30.083 --> 01:58:38.253]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.

[02:00:23.634 --> 02:00:25.596]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:25.936 --> 02:00:30.379]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:00:34.369 --> 02:00:35.270]  Nazis come get out!
[02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:35.390]  Bye!
[02:00:59.372 --> 02:01:03.933]  That's Milo, a gay Jewish man who is a libertarian conservative, hates Nazis.
[02:01:04.593 --> 02:01:05.694]  He is not the alt-right.
[02:01:05.714 --> 02:01:08.094]  Well, they're not even really Nazis, but he's new right.
[02:01:08.795 --> 02:01:09.835]  A nice guy, a friend of mine.
[02:01:10.475 --> 02:01:15.336]  There's Milo being run out of a New York restaurant bar, which the federal judges ruled.
[02:01:15.576 --> 02:01:16.957]  You can kick conservatives out of your business.
[02:01:18.265 --> 02:01:22.047]  Uh, so that's, that's this discrimination and you, you just brought that up Sabo.
[02:01:22.267 --> 02:01:23.408]  You were here in Austin two weeks ago.
[02:01:23.428 --> 02:01:23.968]  What happened to you?
[02:01:24.268 --> 02:01:26.269]  I almost want to go to some bars with you.
[02:01:26.289 --> 02:01:27.530]  We're going to already do dinner tonight.
[02:01:28.050 --> 02:01:33.993]  I almost want to go to some places with you and like videotape this because I mean, I'm going to just sit there and say, wow, we're just Nazi scum.
[02:01:34.213 --> 02:01:34.854]  Cause you're with Alex Jones.
[02:01:34.874 --> 02:01:38.516]  You don't even know what I stand for, but the, but the news says I'm a Nazi.
[02:01:38.876 --> 02:01:43.098]  And like you said, your dad, World War II, both my grandfathers almost died in World War II.
[02:01:43.198 --> 02:01:43.998]  One crash landed.
[02:01:44.519 --> 02:01:46.220]  The other, uh, had heat stroke.
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:51.444]  And didn't go up the next week as the pilot and the plane got blown up over France.
[02:01:51.764 --> 02:01:52.705]  I mean, I mean over Italy.
[02:01:52.885 --> 02:01:53.805]  They were out of North Africa.
[02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:55.387]  He was in the North African invasion.
[02:01:55.647 --> 02:01:56.928]  He was in the Italian invasion.
[02:01:57.248 --> 02:01:57.769]  Almost died.
[02:01:57.849 --> 02:01:59.430]  I almost don't exist because of Hitler.
[02:01:59.750 --> 02:02:08.097]  And then George Soros, an admitted Nazi collaborator, runs the movement trying to kill our free speech and the EU run by Juncker, the grandson of the head of the Nazis under Hitler.
[02:02:08.874 --> 02:02:16.058]  Yeah, I grew up in Louisiana for a few years, and for as long as I was called a wetback here and there, and now all of a sudden I'm a Nazi.
[02:02:16.138 --> 02:02:17.399]  When the hell did that happen?
[02:02:17.779 --> 02:02:28.324]  It's like, yeah, and what really bums me out is I flew into Texas a couple weeks ago, Texas of all places, here in Austin, and three bars said, we don't want your kind here.
[02:02:28.344 --> 02:02:30.906]  Because one guy had a MAGA hat on.
[02:02:31.286 --> 02:02:32.507]  We don't want your kind here.
[02:02:32.527 --> 02:02:34.228]  I'm like, what kind are you talking about?
[02:02:34.248 --> 02:02:36.710]  I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
[02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:40.753]  There used to be a time when the left, you know, they were all about independence.
[02:02:40.773 --> 02:02:44.175]  They were all about all these, you know, about the individual.
[02:02:44.595 --> 02:02:49.078]  And now it's like, if you're not loving on the big government, you're, which doesn't even make sense.
[02:02:49.178 --> 02:02:50.039]  Somehow you're a Nazi.
[02:02:50.559 --> 02:02:55.926]  They're the Nazis, a cult of aggressive people, because you're wearing Make America Great Again.
[02:02:56.526 --> 02:02:57.127]  It's insane.
[02:02:57.347 --> 02:02:59.390]  Even worse, they're communists.
[02:02:59.910 --> 02:03:01.492]  It's like, how many people did the communists kill?
[02:03:01.512 --> 02:03:02.353]  With smartphones.
[02:03:03.074 --> 02:03:05.677]  I notice how conservatives usually aren't wearing really fancy clothes.
[02:03:05.697 --> 02:03:08.480]  I mean, I'm on TV, so I'm wearing a jacket I've been wearing for five years.
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.161]  I love this baby.
[02:03:09.461 --> 02:03:10.182]  This is like a $400 jacket.
[02:03:11.283 --> 02:03:16.248]  The left is always wearing, like, super fancy everything, and the conservatives are just working in art.
[02:03:16.708 --> 02:03:21.913]  I mean, it's like they've got fancy phones, they've got all this crap that capitalism made, but they say they hate it.
[02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:24.536]  And look at all those people that were yelling at Milo.
[02:03:24.976 --> 02:03:25.837]  I mean, come on.
[02:03:26.097 --> 02:03:28.039]  They look like university professors.
[02:03:28.059 --> 02:03:29.841]  They look like these fat, blue-haired women.
[02:03:30.301 --> 02:03:33.324]  It's like, why are we allowing these nerds to push us around?
[02:03:34.105 --> 02:03:39.189]  Well, the universities are really nothing more than socialist indoctrination centers now.
[02:03:39.469 --> 02:03:40.630]  Yeah, they're the cancer.
[02:03:40.650 --> 02:03:47.896]  They're the cult of anti-free speech that's now like a virus takes over a cell, replicates, and so now the cells are busting and the viruses are coming out.
[02:03:49.036 --> 02:03:50.177]  Let's have fun with it, man.
[02:03:50.397 --> 02:03:53.500]  Milo should have ordered another beer and just stood there and flipped them off.
[02:03:55.999 --> 02:04:00.882]  Well, you know, I did a cartoon that's kind of in alignment with what we were just talking about.
[02:04:00.902 --> 02:04:10.568]  I drew a really fancy, you know, super expensive water fountain that's, you know, pumping out pure water, but it's for liberals only, left only.
[02:04:10.928 --> 02:04:17.852]  And then I drew a really kind of a downtrodden, rusted old, you know, water fountain conservatives, you know,
[02:04:17.952 --> 02:04:19.174]  And that's how it was for blacks.
[02:04:19.214 --> 02:04:20.095]  Yeah.
[02:04:20.175 --> 02:04:24.140]  I used that liberal leftist meme and flipped it.
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:25.842]  So I like flipping their own stuff.
[02:04:26.243 --> 02:04:28.466]  And then, hey, you're doing this to conservatives now.
[02:04:28.566 --> 02:04:29.127]  Well, you're awesome.
[02:04:29.147 --> 02:04:34.654]  You're going to be on The War Room coming up with, of course, Roger Stone and with Owen Schroyer.

[02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:11.418]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:11.498 --> 02:06:13.601]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:15.863 --> 02:06:17.025]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:17.045 --> 02:06:17.766]  I would just roll it.
[02:06:17.886 --> 02:06:21.530]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:25.706 --> 02:06:26.427]  Yours truly.
[02:06:26.607 --> 02:06:29.351]  Word on the street is conservatism is the new punk rock.
[02:06:29.491 --> 02:06:32.015]  Just ask Alex Jones's British sidekick.
[02:06:32.215 --> 02:06:37.402]  Leftists are desperately clinging to this idea that they have the monopoly on cool.
[02:06:37.582 --> 02:06:40.205]  Conservatism is the new punk rock.
[02:06:40.606 --> 02:06:48.011]  Well, the old punk rock was a subculture of anti-establishment teenagers screaming into a microphone about being misunderstood and underrepresented.
[02:06:48.191 --> 02:06:51.994]  The new punk rock is just as cool and just as anti-establishment.
[02:06:52.154 --> 02:06:54.256]  And even the lamestream media agrees.
[02:06:54.576 --> 02:06:57.698]  Of course, technically, the right controls, like, the whole establishment.
[02:06:57.718 --> 02:06:58.519]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:06:58.599 --> 02:07:03.222]  My entire argument is that conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:07:03.322 --> 02:07:05.804]  You just listed branches of government.
[02:07:05.844 --> 02:07:09.126]  Hate to break it to you, but none of those are cultural institutions.
[02:07:09.266 --> 02:07:12.768]  The government doesn't control the output of cultural institutions.
[02:07:12.868 --> 02:07:19.170]  God only knows what you're talking about, but I'm talking about Hollywood, the music industry, Silicon Valley, and academia.
[02:07:19.230 --> 02:07:21.351]  They're the high priests of pop culture.
[02:07:21.571 --> 02:07:29.255]  Not Mike Pence, not CPAC, which I specifically said was not representative of counterculture over a year ago.
[02:07:29.335 --> 02:07:34.297]  Then you imply that when I say counterculture or punk, I'm talking about the GOP establishment.
[02:07:34.397 --> 02:07:39.580]  When in another part of the very video you played, I say the exact opposite.
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:43.623]  And obviously I don't mean conservatism like Mitch McConnell conservatism.
[02:07:43.663 --> 02:07:46.284]  I'm not talking about old establishment Republicans.
[02:07:46.324 --> 02:07:52.548]  So in the very first 30 seconds, you've tried to spin it by falsely framing the entire argument.
[02:07:52.628 --> 02:07:59.052]  Conservatism is punk rock because I think
[02:08:00.152 --> 02:08:04.776]  Oh, you edited some people together to make it look like they had no clue what they were talking about.
[02:08:04.856 --> 02:08:09.641]  Because Comedy Central doesn't do that to literally everyone they're trying to demonize, do they?
[02:08:09.901 --> 02:08:10.822]  How original.
[02:08:10.842 --> 02:08:14.045]  You want to know why conservatism is the new counterculture?
[02:08:14.505 --> 02:08:15.346]  Well, listen up.
[02:08:15.546 --> 02:08:21.892]  Decades ago, it was the right who shut down offensive, edgy speech, music, comedy, movies, and art.
[02:08:21.992 --> 02:08:25.255]  They were the ones who no-platformed controversial speech.
[02:08:25.555 --> 02:08:27.036]  Who are the new authoritarians?
[02:08:27.216 --> 02:08:28.858]  Who are the new Puritans?
[02:08:28.898 --> 02:08:34.803]  Who's trying to shut down offensive, edgy speech, music, comedy, movies and art today?
[02:08:35.284 --> 02:08:35.984]  The left.
[02:08:36.104 --> 02:08:40.608]  Who literally riots to shut down controversial ideas now?
[02:08:41.029 --> 02:08:41.749]  The left.
[02:08:41.889 --> 02:08:43.791]  You control popular culture.
[02:08:43.991 --> 02:08:47.654]  You viciously police the boundaries of acceptable speech.
[02:08:47.754 --> 02:08:50.497]  And anyone who dares express diversity of thought
[02:08:51.798 --> 02:08:54.179]  And that's not very punk.
[02:08:54.299 --> 02:09:03.143]  Why do you think contrarians like Jordan Peterson, who rail against identity politics, are the new rock stars who pack out venues?
[02:09:03.223 --> 02:09:05.944]  Why do you think my biggest demographic is 18 to 35 year olds?
[02:09:07.205 --> 02:09:14.928]  While CNN's average viewer is 60, why do you think Generation Z is the most conservative generation since World War II?
[02:09:15.028 --> 02:09:21.251]  These kids are sick of being subjected to the endless, joyless guilt trip that is identity politics.
[02:09:21.311 --> 02:09:26.533]  The endless moralizing about the parameters of acceptable speech and what they can and can't say.
[02:09:26.693 --> 02:09:35.342]  I get messages every day from teenagers in schools and universities who tell me that the new edgy, avant-garde thing to be is anti-left wing.
[02:09:35.642 --> 02:09:37.865]  It's seen as a form of rebellion.
[02:09:37.985 --> 02:09:42.249]  I speak to people who work inside universities who tell me exactly the same thing.
[02:09:42.389 --> 02:09:47.495]  Safe spaces, trigger warnings, literally being afraid of the discussion of new ideas.
[02:09:47.935 --> 02:09:49.596]  That's not very punk, is it?
[02:09:49.656 --> 02:09:53.499]  These kids tell me my content is the new counterculture.
[02:09:53.539 --> 02:09:56.542]  But Comedy Central says that's just not the case.
[02:09:56.742 --> 02:09:58.803]  Right, so who owns Comedy Central?
[02:09:58.963 --> 02:10:06.329]  Oh, look, it's Viacom, a multinational media conglomerate owned by lifetime Democratic donor Sumner Redstone.
[02:10:06.409 --> 02:10:14.155]  So a network owned by a giant global corporation, which in turn is owned by a 94-year-old billionaire.
[02:10:14.235 --> 02:10:16.717]  They're the final authority on what's cool.
[02:10:17.177 --> 02:10:19.939]  They get the final say on what's counterculture.
[02:10:20.059 --> 02:10:21.040]  Give me a break!
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:24.242]  You're an integral part of the establishment.
[02:10:24.262 --> 02:10:28.705]  So where do you get off lecturing your audience on what's anti-establishment?
[02:10:28.745 --> 02:10:33.448]  I mean, I'm no spring chicken, but your boss looks like he's really down with the kids, doesn't he?
[02:10:33.528 --> 02:10:36.330]  What's another defining aspect of counterculture?
[02:10:36.350 --> 02:10:37.710]  Political street art.
[02:10:37.831 --> 02:10:42.333]  What's the nature of the only noteworthy political street art that we see now?
[02:10:42.714 --> 02:10:42.774]  Oh!
[02:10:43.514 --> 02:10:43.655]  Oh!
[02:10:44.396 --> 02:10:44.516]  Oh!
[02:10:45.197 --> 02:10:45.337]  Oh!
[02:10:46.118 --> 02:10:46.158]  Oh!
[02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:47.059]  Oh!
[02:10:47.179 --> 02:10:55.049]  So then they drag out this rotund punk singer from a band that I've never heard of to lecture us all on what it means to be punk.
[02:10:55.150 --> 02:10:55.830]  You're not punks.
[02:10:56.531 --> 02:10:58.995]  You've co-opted the language from punk rock, but...
[02:10:59.655 --> 02:11:00.595]  It doesn't make you punk.
[02:11:00.615 --> 02:11:13.239]  Meanwhile, the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten, you know, one of the true originators of punk, frames Brexit and Trump in the context of populism, in the context of true anti-establishment rebellion.
[02:11:13.279 --> 02:11:14.920]  Where do I stand on Brexit?
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:15.860]  Well, here it goes.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.841]  The working class have spoke.
[02:11:18.521 --> 02:11:20.161]  And I'm one of them, and I'm with them.
[02:11:20.221 --> 02:11:21.001]  The Donald.
[02:11:21.081 --> 02:11:25.683]  As one journalist once said to me, is he the political sex pistol?
[02:11:26.443 --> 02:11:35.189]  In a way, but what I dislike is the left-wing media in America are trying to smear the bloke as a racist and that's completely not true.
[02:11:35.329 --> 02:11:37.170]  He terrifies politicians.
[02:11:37.951 --> 02:11:39.492]  This is joy to behold.
[02:11:39.552 --> 02:11:42.874]  Right, I mean that very much is the Sex Pistols thing, anti-establishment.
[02:11:42.894 --> 02:11:46.737]  He is the absolutely archetypal anti-establishment character.
[02:11:46.757 --> 02:11:52.020]  Yeah, I'm gonna take the opinion of Johnny Rotten over some obese nobody in a garage band.
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:56.043]  Again, the Sex Pistols were no-platformed for being offensive.
[02:12:07.345 --> 02:12:10.506]  Who is doing the no platforming of offensive speech now?
[02:12:10.626 --> 02:12:11.626]  Yeah, that's you guys!
[02:12:12.106 --> 02:12:13.206]  And that's not very punk.
[02:12:13.246 --> 02:12:15.907]  You know, I've been listening to a lot of my favorite commentators on YouTube.
[02:12:15.987 --> 02:12:19.248]  They are saying that, like, our movement is punk.
[02:12:19.568 --> 02:12:21.208]  Can you name, like, a single punk band?
[02:12:21.768 --> 02:12:22.728]  Oh, I hate punk music.
[02:12:22.748 --> 02:12:25.549]  I just want to say controversial stuff that gets my attention.
[02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:31.790]  Right, so they're implying that I'm faking an interest in punk music and that I'm only saying this now to get attention.
[02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:33.210]  Oh, but what's this?
[02:12:33.431 --> 02:12:47.153]  The Daily Beast reports on my old school friends from over 20 years ago saying that I, as a 13-year-old, was into the Sex Pistols, alternative music, smoking, and generally being punk.
[02:12:47.173 --> 02:12:48.473]  Yeah, I was punk now, bitches.
[02:12:48.633 --> 02:12:51.194]  Punk has always been a fairly inclusive place.
[02:12:51.434 --> 02:12:55.395]  The clash you have, songs are talking about anti-racism, they're talking about anti-fascism.
[02:12:55.415 --> 02:12:58.436]  You have bands like the Bad Brains, a group of black kids in DC.
[02:12:58.496 --> 02:13:01.657]  Riot Grrrl, women that felt underrepresented or not represented at all.
[02:13:01.697 --> 02:13:03.578]  People of different sexualities, trans people.
[02:13:03.598 --> 02:13:16.842]  Right, so because some punk bands decades ago pushed identity politics, which back then they did with, let's be fair, some merit and pure motivation, that means the modern counterculture should be about pushing identity politics.
[02:13:17.142 --> 02:13:23.927]  So how on earth can it be anti-establishment and punk to push identity politics?
[02:13:47.422 --> 02:13:50.144]  Identity politics is the establishment.
[02:13:50.264 --> 02:13:53.087]  Identity politics is the dominant culture.
[02:13:53.107 --> 02:13:58.311]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture at the same time, idiot!
[02:13:58.731 --> 02:14:08.859]  All across Europe, the age group of voters powering populist parties, parties that reject identity politics, is getting younger and younger.
[02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:19.263]  So again, we see this attempt to portray the right as joyless Puritans who can't have fun.
[02:14:19.303 --> 02:14:25.246]  Yet it's the left who consistently act like joyless Puritans and literally try to ban fun.
[02:14:25.286 --> 02:14:29.809]  Whether it be cheerleaders, offensive songs, topless models, or free speech.
[02:14:29.889 --> 02:14:31.310]  You're the new censors.
[02:14:31.590 --> 02:14:33.391]  You're the new Puritans.
[02:14:33.911 --> 02:14:35.212]  And that's not very punk.
[02:14:35.352 --> 02:14:43.118]  Being owned by a monolithic transnational corporation and a 94-year-old billionaire, that's not very punk.
[02:14:43.378 --> 02:14:58.209]  Using these vast resources to create an entire TV series, which has appallingly average reviews by the way, based almost exclusively on demonizing Infowars, a far smaller independent media outlet, that's not very punk either.
[02:14:58.289 --> 02:15:00.651]  And by the way, there's another reason why the left lost
[02:15:00.831 --> 02:15:02.912]  I don't mean to sound the alarm, but...
[02:15:15.168 --> 02:15:23.516]  You stopped being funny because you stopped taking risks and you started placing more importance on being politically correct than making people laugh.
[02:15:23.576 --> 02:15:26.058]  Look at all the coolest, best-loved comedians.
[02:15:26.118 --> 02:15:30.162]  People like Roseanne, Bill Burr, Joe Rogan, Ricky Gervais.
[02:15:30.242 --> 02:15:40.432]  They may not be conservatives, but they're all completely adversarial to the kind of sterile, unfunny, identity politics garbage that you try to pass off as comedy.
[02:15:40.452 --> 02:15:41.193]  Who've you got?
[02:15:41.353 --> 02:15:43.535]  Amy Schumer talking about her vagina?
[02:15:43.875 --> 02:15:44.416]  Again?
[02:15:44.516 --> 02:15:45.477]  Comedy Central.
[02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:47.318]  You're just not funny.
[02:15:47.639 --> 02:15:49.480]  And you're not counterculture either.
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:53.744]  You're literally owned by a guy who has more wrinkles than an elephant's butt.
[02:15:53.964 --> 02:15:57.347]  You've lost 15 million viewers over the last 10 years.
[02:15:57.467 --> 02:15:58.869]  You're dying on your arse.
[02:15:58.889 --> 02:16:00.650]  You're not resonating with young people.
[02:16:00.690 --> 02:16:02.072]  Your audience is getting older.
[02:16:02.839 --> 02:16:05.621]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:16:06.242 --> 02:16:09.804]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:16:10.205 --> 02:16:13.167]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:16:13.567 --> 02:16:15.549]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:16:16.089 --> 02:16:20.513]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:16:20.833 --> 02:16:22.894]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:16:23.175 --> 02:16:29.560]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:37.407]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:16:38.388 --> 02:16:43.033]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:16:43.433 --> 02:16:50.420]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:16:51.061 --> 02:16:55.545]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:48.792]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[02:17:49.152 --> 02:17:51.734]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[02:17:52.014 --> 02:17:55.337]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride-free products.
[02:17:55.637 --> 02:18:00.521]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:00.621 --> 02:18:02.603]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:02.843 --> 02:18:03.464]  Alpha Power.
[02:18:03.804 --> 02:18:04.605]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:18:04.825 --> 02:18:10.810]  You want to go to InfoWarsStore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:18:11.470 --> 02:18:15.013]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:18:15.894 --> 02:18:23.837]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:18:24.377 --> 02:18:31.959]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:18:31.979 --> 02:18:33.680]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:39.162]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country and I say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:18:39.442 --> 02:18:42.803]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in
[02:18:43.303 --> 02:18:47.747]  And you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:18:48.168 --> 02:18:49.188]  Nobody else does that.
[02:18:49.269 --> 02:18:51.971]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:18:52.331 --> 02:18:54.353]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:18:54.734 --> 02:19:00.078]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll-free, AAA, 253-3139.
[02:19:03.444 --> 02:19:04.185]  I'm so excited.
[02:19:04.245 --> 02:19:13.811]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:19:14.391 --> 02:19:19.575]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:19:19.895 --> 02:19:22.697]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:19:22.917 --> 02:19:31.683]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:19:33.784 --> 02:19:43.326]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:19:44.047 --> 02:19:52.869]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:19:53.369 --> 02:19:54.669]  It is amazing!
[02:19:56.050 --> 02:20:01.031]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:20:06.386 --> 02:20:09.149]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.602 --> 02:20:24.567]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now a special report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:33.842]  In a watershed moment for the culture war, Kanye West praised conservative commentator Candace Owens in a tweet saying, And how did Twitter react?
[02:20:33.862 --> 02:20:36.245]  By failing to even spell Owens' name properly and calling her,
[02:20:42.614 --> 02:20:43.375]  Far-right!
[02:20:43.715 --> 02:20:54.001]  They're going to call a former left-wing, now centre-right black conservative, who is hated by the actual far-right, far-right, then all bets are now off.
[02:20:54.161 --> 02:20:57.864]  And then the usual blue checkmarks piled in with their lies and hatred.
[02:20:57.884 --> 02:21:07.570]  Candace Owens is a far-right media personality who got famous by appearing on the conspiracy site InfoWars and calling herself a red pill black, a term popularised on the alt-right men's rights message board that is basically an antonym for woke.
[02:21:07.850 --> 02:21:08.670]  Wrong, idiot.
[02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:13.691]  She got famous by communicating a message of actual empowerment for black people.
[02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:16.212]  So save us the glib whitesplaining, please.
[02:21:16.312 --> 02:21:19.953]  Talking of whitesplaining, Sean King whined about it, too.
[02:21:20.033 --> 02:21:24.614]  Yeah, how are you gonna accuse Kanye of being an Uncle Tom when you're whiter than Rachel Dolezal?
[02:21:24.654 --> 02:21:24.774]  Blip!
[02:21:25.314 --> 02:21:27.955]  So precisely how does Candace Owens think?
[02:21:28.115 --> 02:21:34.556]  Well, she tells black people not to be victims, not to be dependent on welfare, and not to blame society for all their problems.
[02:21:34.736 --> 02:21:40.279]  The truth is that the left wants to strap black people to this idea that they are victims.
[02:21:40.379 --> 02:21:41.399]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:21:41.439 --> 02:21:43.480]  They do not want black people focused on their futures.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:45.281]  They want black people focused on their past.
[02:21:45.621 --> 02:21:47.702]  They like black people to be government dependent.
[02:21:47.742 --> 02:21:50.664]  They don't like to see black people that are free thinkers and are independent.
[02:21:51.004 --> 02:21:55.426]  I think that's what Kanye West and myself represents, the black community, and that makes them very nervous.
[02:21:55.626 --> 02:21:58.648]  That correlates exactly with Kanye's new outlook.
[02:21:58.748 --> 02:22:03.772]  Remember, Kanye met with Trump to talk about tackling black-on-black violence in Chicago.
[02:22:03.832 --> 02:22:11.858]  Something that the left and Black Lives Matter supporters refused to incorporate into their message because it doesn't fit their race-baiting victimhood narrative.
[02:22:11.918 --> 02:22:19.544]  Kanye has also exposed how the left fans the flames of hysteria over racism to metaphorically keep black people on the plantation.
[02:22:19.584 --> 02:22:21.706]  To keep them docile and easily controlled.
[02:22:21.866 --> 02:22:24.669]  Racism is a dated concept.
[02:22:24.970 --> 02:22:29.214]  It's not an actual thing that even means anything.
[02:22:29.394 --> 02:22:42.689]  You know, it's something that was used to hold people back in the past, but now there's been so many leaps and breaking of the rules that it's like, it's played out like, you know, like a style from the, you know,
[02:22:44.219 --> 02:22:45.300]  1800s or something.
[02:22:45.861 --> 02:22:52.667]  You know, the real true freedom isn't in the words, the true freedom is in the opportunity.
[02:22:52.727 --> 02:23:02.496]  Kanye West represents a massive threat to the left because he has an army of adoring fans and he's clearly done with being a puppet for their divisive agenda.
[02:23:02.616 --> 02:23:07.260]  After this, he's going to be relentlessly attacked by the establishment like never before.
[02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:08.140]  Get ready.
[02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:19.722]  The mainstream entertainment industry is so stale, so controlled, so adversarial to originality, it can no longer produce any icons with actual authenticity.
[02:23:19.822 --> 02:23:22.583]  Kanye himself has alluded to this on several occasions.
[02:23:22.663 --> 02:23:24.483]  These y'all been lied to!
[02:23:24.663 --> 02:23:25.023]  Radio!
[02:23:25.043 --> 02:23:27.064]  Lied to you!
[02:23:27.184 --> 02:23:32.565]  They can't play what they wanna play, because they've been paid to play that bullshit!
[02:23:34.588 --> 02:23:42.233]  Celebrities with something to say other than vacuous virtue signaling and cliche platitudes are now all but extinct.
[02:23:42.273 --> 02:23:51.259]  And that's because any celebrity that uses their platform to speak uncomfortable truths is immediately shunned and attacked by the legacy media.
[02:23:51.299 --> 02:23:56.383]  Look what they did to Morrissey after he spoke out against mass immigration and Islamic terrorism.
[02:23:56.443 --> 02:24:04.428]  This paucity of authentic, interesting celebrities is why YouTubers like PewDiePie and Candace Owens are the new
[02:24:04.428 --> 02:24:05.229]  We the rock stars!
[02:24:22.825 --> 02:24:24.106]  Oh, but Kanye had a breakdown.
[02:24:24.146 --> 02:24:24.967]  He's gone insane.
[02:24:25.027 --> 02:24:31.371]  Yeah, if you haven't been paying attention, Kanye's had about 10 what they call breakdowns since the mid-2000s.
[02:24:31.391 --> 02:24:34.494]  And he always comes back more influential than ever before.
[02:24:34.794 --> 02:24:34.994]  Blip!
[02:24:35.194 --> 02:24:41.018]  That's why they're terrified of him endorsing ideas and people outside of their control.
[02:24:41.138 --> 02:24:41.759]  Who's they?
[02:24:42.099 --> 02:24:49.282]  I'm talking about the dominant cultural institutions of Hollywood, the entertainment industry, the music industry, and the media.
[02:24:49.342 --> 02:24:56.906]  The high priests of pop culture, the gatekeepers of what political and spiritual ideas we're told are acceptable.
[02:24:57.006 --> 02:25:00.988]  Now one of their own has gone rogue, and the panic is palpable.
[02:25:01.048 --> 02:25:02.989]  Your Truman Show boat is hitting the water.
[02:25:03.329 --> 02:25:05.631]  Why do you think Kanye fears for his own life?
[02:25:05.772 --> 02:25:09.715]  As Andrew Breitbart said, politics is downstream from culture.
[02:25:09.775 --> 02:25:14.099]  You can change political destiny by hijacking culture.
[02:25:14.119 --> 02:25:16.542]  In case you haven't noticed, that's what I'm doing.
[02:25:16.642 --> 02:25:17.863]  The left is slowly
[02:25:18.183 --> 02:25:22.764]  Waking up to the fact that they're losing their monopoly on controlling culture.
[02:25:22.804 --> 02:25:31.066]  When you've been in control for so many decades, something new inevitably has to emerge to become the new counterculture.
[02:25:31.126 --> 02:25:36.148]  Especially given that the left no longer pushes to be edgy, daring, or rebellious.
[02:25:36.328 --> 02:25:41.109]  And has instead embraced censorship, puritanism, and cultural sterility.
[02:25:41.149 --> 02:25:44.570]  The high priests of pop culture are the real racists.
[02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:48.611]  They're the ones who indoctrinate young black kids to aspire to be thugs.
[02:25:48.671 --> 02:25:54.293]  They're the ones who fetishize and glorify criminality and gangsterism through hip-hop music.
[02:25:54.333 --> 02:26:01.875]  Kanye is trying to move black people away from the ghettoization of their minds towards true independence and freedom.
[02:26:01.935 --> 02:26:05.376]  Candice Owens is trying to do exactly the same thing.
[02:26:05.737 --> 02:26:07.737]  And that's why they resonate with each other.
[02:26:07.797 --> 02:26:10.418]  And that's why the left is petrified of them both.
[02:26:10.658 --> 02:26:18.485]  What you're seeing happening today, obviously we have some black people that are just shouting in the back, we have some black people that are sitting in the front quietly that are chanting USA and having a normal conversation.
[02:26:18.645 --> 02:26:27.113]  I love that because what I say every single time, and you may have seen me on the news, is that what is happening right now in the black community, you're going to hear it in this room first, there is an ideological civil war happening.
[02:26:27.173 --> 02:26:32.098]  Black people that are focused on their past and shouting about slavery, and black people that are focused on their futures, okay?
[02:26:32.218 --> 02:26:33.799]  That's really what it comes down to, okay?
[02:26:35.347 --> 02:26:40.809]  I can guarantee you what you're seeing happening is victim mentality versus victor mentality.
[02:26:40.829 --> 02:26:41.909]  I promise you.
[02:26:42.009 --> 02:26:42.589]  I love that.
[02:26:42.609 --> 02:26:43.089]  Isn't that great?
[02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.730]  I love that.
[02:26:46.370 --> 02:26:47.851]  And there's no doubt in my mind.
[02:26:47.911 --> 02:26:56.913]  I can tell you right now who is going to be better off when we look 20 years, when we look at the faces in this room, who is going to be better off are the girls that are sitting right here and across this room because they don't have your mentality.
[02:26:57.173 --> 02:26:58.454]  Victim mentality is not cool.
[02:26:58.674 --> 02:27:00.354]  I don't know why people like being oppressed.
[02:27:00.374 --> 02:27:01.434]  It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
[02:27:01.674 --> 02:27:02.555]  I love oppression.
[02:27:02.875 --> 02:27:03.415]  We're oppressed.
[02:27:03.935 --> 02:27:06.917]  400 years of slavery, Jim Crow, which by the way, none of you guys lived through.
[02:27:06.957 --> 02:27:11.420]  Your grandparents did and it's embarrassing that you utilize, you utilize their history.
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:16.343]  You utilize their history and you come in here with more emotion than they ever had when they were living through it.
[02:27:16.603 --> 02:27:19.125]  More emotion than they ever had when they were living through it.
[02:27:19.145 --> 02:27:19.925]  It's embarrassing.
[02:27:20.206 --> 02:27:22.527]  You're not living through anything right now.
[02:27:22.787 --> 02:27:25.449]  You're overly privileged Americans.
[02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:28.151]  I'm also afraid that Kanye could be president one day.
[02:27:28.632 --> 02:27:29.492]  I'm not joking.
[02:27:29.552 --> 02:27:32.935]  As Terrence Williams said, both Kanye and Candace are free thinkers.
[02:27:33.235 --> 02:27:36.738]  If that triggers you, chances are you're not a free thinker.
[02:27:36.778 --> 02:27:39.500]  The left doesn't care about black people.
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:43.303]  They don't want black people to be business owners, doctors or scientists.
[02:27:43.363 --> 02:27:47.026]  They want them to remain mired in dependency and hopelessness.
[02:27:47.066 --> 02:27:50.169]  They want them to continue to vote for their own enslavement.
[02:27:50.209 --> 02:27:54.232]  And whether you love or hate Kanye's narcissistic personality,
[02:27:54.312 --> 02:27:58.937]  When someone comes up and says something like, I am a god, everybody says, who does he think he is?
[02:27:59.437 --> 02:28:01.239]  I just told you who I thought I was!
[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:01.980]  A god!
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:14.313]  The mere threat of him derailing this agenda to any degree, the mere fact that they don't control what comes out of his mouth, is what keeps the high priests of pop culture awake at night.
[02:28:14.453 --> 02:28:16.756]  And this is an extremely visionary move on my part.
[02:28:22.478 --> 02:28:26.622]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:28:27.382 --> 02:28:28.784]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:29:02.856 --> 02:29:06.717]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:29:07.277 --> 02:29:14.680]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:20.082]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:29:20.682 --> 02:29:22.603]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:29:23.223 --> 02:29:26.644]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:29:27.444 --> 02:29:29.905]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:29:30.598 --> 02:29:37.266]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:29:37.866 --> 02:29:45.074]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:29:45.955 --> 02:29:52.600]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:54.261]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:29:54.621 --> 02:29:56.483]  Use Carnivore by InfoWarsLife.
[02:29:57.283 --> 02:30:00.245]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:30:00.766 --> 02:30:02.487]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:04.940]  Good morning.
[02:30:05.421 --> 02:30:06.481]  My name is Andrew Grossman.
[02:30:06.882 --> 02:30:08.803]  I'm a partner at the law firm Baker Hostetler.
[02:30:08.963 --> 02:30:12.805]  I represent Alex and InfoWars in the lawsuit that was filed by Brendan Gilmore.
[02:30:13.105 --> 02:30:21.831]  This morning, we asked the District Court to dismiss Mr. Gilmore's lawsuit, to require Mr. Gilmore to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding to his lawsuit.
[02:30:22.211 --> 02:30:27.096]  And to sanction Mr. Gilmour for using a federal court to wage a publicity stunt.
[02:30:27.456 --> 02:30:28.698]  Now let me be clear about this.
[02:30:29.078 --> 02:30:32.802]  Mr. Gilmour's claims against Alex Jones and Infowars are legally defective.
[02:30:33.022 --> 02:30:36.325]  We are confident that the suit will be thrown out of court.
[02:30:36.726 --> 02:30:40.309]  But make no mistake, vexatious lawsuits like this one are dangerous.
[02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:43.692]  Because they seek to chip away at our cherished First Amendment rights.
[02:30:44.132 --> 02:30:47.735]  The First Amendment gives all Americans the right to have their say on today's news.
[02:30:48.195 --> 02:30:57.381]  Alex Jones thought it was strange that Mr. Gilmour was popping up in all the media coverage on the events in Charlottesville, with what seemed like the same anti-Trump talking points every time.
[02:30:57.521 --> 02:31:00.363]  And that is exactly what Mr. Jones questioned.
[02:31:00.403 --> 02:31:05.507]  Was the media, with Mr. Gilmour's eager assistance, spinning the story against President Trump?
[02:31:06.327 --> 02:31:14.552]  That is the kind of probing question that every cable news analyst, every columnist, and every American who cares about what's going on in this country asks every day.
[02:31:15.152 --> 02:31:18.894]  They try to make sense of what they see reported in the news, and then they say what they think.
[02:31:19.374 --> 02:31:22.116]  The First Amendment absolutely protects that speech.
[02:31:22.456 --> 02:31:23.777]  Now, Mr. Gilmour disagrees.
[02:31:24.457 --> 02:31:27.759]  He obviously opposes Alex Jones's political viewpoint.
[02:31:28.259 --> 02:31:33.461]  He says that Infowars is not what he considers to be responsible journalism and that it can therefore be suppressed.
[02:31:34.102 --> 02:31:40.405]  His lawyers say that the law should distinguish between speech that informs the public and speech that they think misinforms the public.
[02:31:40.865 --> 02:31:46.548]  But the whole point of the First Amendment is that people like Mr. Gilmour and his lawyers do not
[02:31:46.988 --> 02:31:47.388]  We're good to go.
[02:32:10.285 --> 02:32:17.653]  That kind of abuse must have consequences, so that when people like Mr. Gilmour are thinking about filing suit, they think first before they do so.
[02:32:18.133 --> 02:32:25.260]  And that's why we're asking the court to find that Mr. Gilmour's lawsuit is what the law calls a strategic lawsuit against public participation.
[02:32:25.761 --> 02:32:32.127]  If the court agrees, Mr. Gilmour will be required to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding.
[02:32:33.028 --> 02:32:35.490]  And we'll be subject to additional monetary sanctions.
[02:32:36.170 --> 02:32:38.492]  Mr. Gilmour brought these consequences on himself.
[02:32:39.073 --> 02:32:43.816]  He leapt at the chance to file a lawsuit instead of exercising his own First Amendment rights to talk back.
[02:32:44.536 --> 02:32:57.546]  We can only hope that he will come to understand the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' words that when it comes to fighting perceived falsehoods and fallacies, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.
[02:32:58.126 --> 02:32:59.647]  And with that, I'll turn it back to Alex.
[02:32:59.867 --> 02:33:00.168]  Thank you.
[02:33:06.235 --> 02:33:08.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.585 --> 02:33:24.490]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:33:25.050 --> 02:33:26.752]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:33:27.372 --> 02:33:30.015]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:33.305 --> 02:33:43.411]  Well, the left ruins everything it gets its grimy mitts on, and now the NFL ratings are down, they kneel for the national anthem, and they want to ban cheerleaders.
[02:33:43.591 --> 02:33:44.132]  That's right.
[02:33:44.512 --> 02:33:47.194]  They want to get rid of cheerleaders in the NFL.
[02:33:47.514 --> 02:33:48.995]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[02:34:00.919 --> 02:34:02.439]  Who doesn't like cheerleaders?
[02:34:02.519 --> 02:34:04.100]  Fat, ugly, bitter feminists.
[02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:05.000]  Obviously.
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:07.881]  And USA Today columnist Nancy Ormore.
[02:34:07.941 --> 02:34:10.962]  No place in the NFL for cheerleaders in 2018!
[02:34:11.002 --> 02:34:17.624]  So after calling for classic songs to be banned for their offensive lyrics, USA Today now wants cheerleaders gone too.
[02:34:17.724 --> 02:34:19.164]  Is anything sacred?
[02:34:19.204 --> 02:34:21.405]  The Houston Texans aren't even bothering with the pretense.
[02:34:21.445 --> 02:34:26.626]  On their website is a photo gallery of the finalists from last weekend's cheerleader tryouts and visitors are encouraged to vote for their favourites.
[02:34:26.906 --> 02:34:30.170]  Are these action shots of the women that highlight their athletic ability or down skills?
[02:34:30.350 --> 02:34:32.572]  Do they include a list of their qualifications?
[02:34:32.753 --> 02:34:33.273]  Of course not.
[02:34:33.313 --> 02:34:33.934]  They're head shots.
[02:34:33.994 --> 02:34:35.155]  Sorry, head and chest shots.
[02:34:35.336 --> 02:34:36.297]  Close-up ones at that!
[02:34:36.417 --> 02:34:37.818]  They're better to uggle, you know.
[02:34:37.838 --> 02:34:43.224]  Wait, you mean to tell me that they judge women for a role that specifically requires hotness?
[02:34:44.025 --> 02:34:45.446]  On the level of their hotness!
[02:34:45.506 --> 02:34:47.727]  And not their academic qualifications!
[02:34:47.787 --> 02:34:53.991]  Because the first thought that pops into my head when I watch this is, gee, I wonder what grade point average this chick got.
[02:34:54.051 --> 02:34:54.952]  Newsflash, dummy.
[02:34:55.232 --> 02:34:57.073]  Men like to look at hot women.
[02:34:57.373 --> 02:34:58.534]  That's never gonna change.
[02:34:58.634 --> 02:35:04.397]  And no matter how much you try to browbeat, shame and re-educate us, that's always gonna be a thing.
[02:35:04.497 --> 02:35:07.579]  You can't reverse basic biology through social engineering.
[02:35:07.619 --> 02:35:10.302]  The underlining premise of NFL cheerleaders is degrading!
[02:35:10.503 --> 02:35:16.390]  Presenting women as nothing more than objects to be leered at with skimpy, suggestive outfits as their uniform, their only purpose is to titillate!
[02:35:16.430 --> 02:35:17.071]  And you know what?
[02:35:17.792 --> 02:35:18.553]  She's got a point.
[02:35:18.794 --> 02:35:20.215]  This is just morally wrong.
[02:35:20.396 --> 02:35:25.082]  Congress really should pass a law to prevent women from being forced into cheerleading.
[02:35:25.302 --> 02:35:28.463]  Oh wait, that wouldn't be necessary because it's completely optional.
[02:35:28.544 --> 02:35:33.846]  I mean, cheerleaders just hate cheerleading so much, some of them pay just to audition.
[02:35:33.926 --> 02:35:37.728]  Women making their own choices on what to do with their bodies.
[02:35:37.808 --> 02:35:39.909]  Wasn't that what women's lib was all about?
[02:35:40.109 --> 02:35:41.169]  Freedom of choice.
[02:35:41.229 --> 02:35:48.793]  You know, before all you resentful harpies hijacked feminism and turned it into a global laughingstock with your harebrained intersectional nonsense.
[02:35:49.033 --> 02:35:54.477]  It's always been an appalling message to send, and in this hashtag MeToo era, there's no longer any place for it.
[02:35:54.557 --> 02:35:56.179]  NFL cheerleaders need to go.
[02:35:56.479 --> 02:35:59.661]  NBA dance squads and NHL ice girls, well, we're at it too!
[02:35:59.802 --> 02:36:06.427]  Right, so in the name of feminism and supporting women, you want to deprive tens of thousands of current and future women of work.
[02:36:06.727 --> 02:36:19.015]  You purport to be a champion of women, yet you refer to these women as blow-up dolls come to life simply because they've chosen to do something that your joyless puritanical ass doesn't approve of.
[02:36:19.055 --> 02:36:21.517]  Now let's pause there and have another look at some cheerleaders.
[02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:37.532]  As I was saying, men like to look at hot women.
[02:36:37.592 --> 02:36:44.116]  Control freak, middle-aged, pearl-clutching, left-wing journalists who write for USA Today don't like to look at hot women.
[02:36:44.156 --> 02:36:46.358]  Did you fail the high school cheer team?
[02:36:46.758 --> 02:36:47.539]  Is that what it is?
[02:36:47.559 --> 02:36:51.201]  Oh, and by the way, this isn't just about shaking around pom-poms on game day.
[02:36:51.261 --> 02:36:54.763]  Many of these cheerleaders do important charity work and community outreach.
[02:36:54.783 --> 02:37:01.248]  They're one of the biggest entertainment groups to regularly perform for the United States Armed Forces overseas.
[02:37:01.288 --> 02:37:04.770]  These girls literally go into war zones to lift the spirits of the dead.
[02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:09.492]  And she admits this in her own article, but then says, man, just ban them anyway.
[02:37:09.552 --> 02:37:15.013]  I mean, the NFL is already hemorrhaging viewers because of its tolerance of social justice stupidity.
[02:37:15.073 --> 02:37:16.874]  Now you want to take away the cheerleaders?
[02:37:17.014 --> 02:37:18.354]  I mean, what can we ban next?
[02:37:18.494 --> 02:37:19.755]  Las Vegas showgirls?
[02:37:19.855 --> 02:37:20.955]  Burlesque dancers?
[02:37:21.315 --> 02:37:22.336]  Instagram hotties?
[02:37:22.576 --> 02:37:24.616]  Why don't we just ban models altogether?
[02:37:24.676 --> 02:37:29.678]  I mean, what other potential career paths for young women can we terminate because we're such good feminists?
[02:37:29.838 --> 02:37:31.699]  But Paul, this is just one newspaper columnist.
[02:37:31.799 --> 02:37:32.440]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:34.561]  This is part of a wider purge.
[02:37:34.781 --> 02:37:41.865]  F1 Grid Girls Band, The Tennis Girl Poster Band, Beach Body Ads Band, Page 3 Girls Band, Booth Babes Band.
[02:37:41.965 --> 02:37:44.447]  We just made hundreds of thousands of women unemployed.
[02:37:44.667 --> 02:37:45.888]  Go feminism!
[02:37:49.597 --> 02:38:02.060]  Oh, we'll bitch and moan all day about the horror of displaying women who choose to wear what they want, while simultaneously celebrating a modesty culture that forces women to wear bags on their heads as a symbol of women's empowerment.
[02:38:02.140 --> 02:38:09.881]  Maybe if we just compelled women to wear certain items of clothing, you'd be all for it, because that's what seems to pass as feminism these days.
[02:38:09.981 --> 02:38:13.842]  No, the whole point should be to let women be rocket scientists.
[02:38:14.802 --> 02:38:20.926]  Oh Babylon jigglers, give them equal opportunity and mind your own frigging business!
[02:38:21.126 --> 02:38:24.488]  Feminists are going on and on and on about how it's degrading to women.
[02:38:24.808 --> 02:38:31.132]  The women that are actually doing it don't feel degraded and we're not being given the choice to decide now whether we want to do it or not.
[02:38:31.152 --> 02:38:34.853]  And this isn't a feminist crusade, this is a class crusade.
[02:38:34.933 --> 02:38:45.055]  This is about a bunch of condescending, sanctimonious, elitist snobs like Nancy Armour looking down their noses at hard-working girls just trying to make their way in life.
[02:38:45.175 --> 02:38:47.795]  Look, not all girls can aspire to be like you.
[02:38:47.835 --> 02:38:54.397]  To write laborious, tormented diatribes about how everything that offends your prudish sensibilities should be banned.
[02:38:54.457 --> 02:39:00.258]  So embrace real feminism, embrace real equality, and leave these girls the hell alone.
[02:39:02.170 --> 02:39:11.917]  Another example of the control freak left that wants to decide what jobs women can or can't have or what jobs may or may not be degrading to women.
[02:39:12.398 --> 02:39:13.078]  One day they say...
[02:39:14.619 --> 02:39:19.322]  We need to allow women to operate as sex slaves on the dark web.
[02:39:19.462 --> 02:39:22.243]  The next day they'll say, you know, that's their choice.
[02:39:22.303 --> 02:39:23.244]  My body, my choice.
[02:39:23.544 --> 02:39:26.706]  But the next day they'll say you can't have cheerleaders in the NFL.
[02:39:27.306 --> 02:39:29.368]  Just another example of the leftist control freak.
[02:39:29.968 --> 02:39:32.750]  But, I think that they're on to something here.
[02:39:35.282 --> 02:39:38.905]  Yeah, I think that they should get rid of cheerleaders in the NFL.
[02:39:38.965 --> 02:39:39.926]  But why stop there?
[02:39:40.706 --> 02:39:41.847]  Let's go on down the line.
[02:39:41.867 --> 02:39:44.069]  Let's get rid of cheerleaders at the college level.
[02:39:44.569 --> 02:39:47.611]  Let's get rid of the cheerleaders at high school levels.
[02:39:48.172 --> 02:39:51.514]  And, you know, there's male cheerleaders there, too, so we don't want to be sexist.
[02:39:51.554 --> 02:39:59.040]  Let's get rid of all of them, okay, so they don't get to put that on their resume or gain that experience or get that opportunity to get a scholarship to go to college.
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:39:59.901]  Let's end all that.
[02:40:00.566 --> 02:40:01.386]  But why stop there?
[02:40:01.686 --> 02:40:03.107]  Let's even go farther down the line.
[02:40:03.387 --> 02:40:05.707]  You've got, like, what about beauty pageants?
[02:40:06.287 --> 02:40:07.568]  Swimsuit competitions.
[02:40:07.588 --> 02:40:09.008]  I mean, that happens at bars.
[02:40:09.128 --> 02:40:10.948]  I think we should stop all that, too.
[02:40:11.608 --> 02:40:16.850]  And then you've got, what is it, little, they have, like, beauty pageants for, like, little girls, too.
[02:40:16.970 --> 02:40:19.430]  There was the one television show.
[02:40:19.610 --> 02:40:20.810]  There's multiple shows, actually.
[02:40:21.051 --> 02:40:22.771]  So we should cancel those television shows.
[02:40:23.837 --> 02:40:26.378]  Cancel the youth beauty pageants as well.
[02:40:27.659 --> 02:40:36.702]  And then, once you've gotten that all accomplished, then we should go after the strip club industry and we should make sure that we don't have strip clubs or gentleman's clubs or anything like that.
[02:40:36.882 --> 02:40:41.824]  And then ultimately we'll save Stormy Daniels from all the plight that she's had to deal with.
[02:40:43.105 --> 02:40:43.385]  Oh, what?
[02:40:43.405 --> 02:40:45.106]  She's making how much money off of this again?
[02:40:46.818 --> 02:40:47.279]  Oh wow.
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:49.562]  Oh, and getting donations?
[02:40:49.822 --> 02:40:54.068]  300 grand in donations plus all the money she makes from her porn star tour?
[02:40:54.949 --> 02:40:57.812]  Okay, well it makes a lot of money, so of course the left wants to shut it down.
[02:40:57.913 --> 02:41:00.756]  Alright, well, I somehow have to segue off of that.
[02:41:01.721 --> 02:41:06.584]  To Matt Bracken, my next guest, who will be with me in the next segment as well.
[02:41:06.644 --> 02:41:11.348]  Matt, it seems to me right now that it's the perfect opportunity for a false flag in America.
[02:41:12.028 --> 02:41:29.300]  While the left is becoming totally unhinged, it's very easy to get a windup doll to go out there and commit some heinous act, given how the far left minions right now are pretty much losing their cool, losing their sanity, and are on the brink of a total breakdown.
[02:41:31.234 --> 02:41:42.679]  Reading between the lines of the news yesterday, before last year, I never even knew that the Republicans had a baseball team or that they had practices in Northern Virginia.
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:45.621]  Or that there was not much security there.
[02:41:46.021 --> 02:41:47.682]  That nobody came out and shot at them.
[02:41:51.223 --> 02:41:59.147]  I would expect something like that to happen potentially now that the Mueller-Comey investigation, the wheels are coming off of that.
[02:42:00.265 --> 02:42:02.627]  I wouldn't be surprised if something like that does happen.
[02:42:02.687 --> 02:42:03.627]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:03.767 --> 02:42:06.449]  And their whole Russian collusion thing is falling apart, too.
[02:42:06.569 --> 02:42:07.750]  You know, there was a story.
[02:42:08.791 --> 02:42:13.694]  Faith Goldie, who's a conservative speaker, she was scheduled to speak at an event at a university.
[02:42:14.074 --> 02:42:15.535]  Security was going to cost about $7,000.
[02:42:16.816 --> 02:42:20.038]  Overnight, it shot up to $30,000, and they had to cancel the event.
[02:42:20.902 --> 02:42:23.526]  Now, where is that threat coming from?
[02:42:23.586 --> 02:42:24.307]  What is the violence?
[02:42:24.367 --> 02:42:26.009]  Why all this need for increased security?
[02:42:26.029 --> 02:42:27.011]  Well, the answer is obvious.
[02:42:27.031 --> 02:42:34.661]  You have a bunch of rabid leftists out there that hate free speech, that have been brainwashed by media to think that anyone that's a conservative is a Nazi.
[02:42:35.042 --> 02:42:36.203]  They're ready to pop off.
[02:42:36.724 --> 02:42:45.309]  I mean, this is the moment that they've been waiting for, and if they get enough of them in that mindset, they might actually be able to get them to pull something off.
[02:42:45.329 --> 02:42:48.230]  So Matt Bracken and I are going to break it down all on the other side.
[02:42:48.811 --> 02:42:50.572]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[02:46:12.371 --> 02:46:12.972]  Hey, brother.
[02:46:13.272 --> 02:46:13.632]  Good, man.
[02:46:13.672 --> 02:46:14.472]  Thank you for calling.
[02:46:14.552 --> 02:46:15.113]  Hey, hey.
[02:46:15.213 --> 02:46:19.615]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:46:19.835 --> 02:46:26.219]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.

[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:35.004]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:46:35.424 --> 02:46:36.544]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:46:36.604 --> 02:46:40.626]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:46:41.006 --> 02:46:42.627]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:46:43.067 --> 02:46:43.807]  And exactly.
[02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:48.049]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:46:48.409 --> 02:46:48.689]  Boom!
[02:46:48.829 --> 02:46:51.650]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:52.250]  It's amazing.
[02:46:52.290 --> 02:46:56.532]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:47:06.258 --> 02:47:09.002]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.062 --> 02:47:15.292]  Watch me!
[02:47:22.422 --> 02:47:28.904]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.365 --> 02:47:32.766]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:47:35.167 --> 02:47:46.431]  Here is the perfect scenario for the corporate fake news press, the fake news television media, the CNNs, the MSNBCs of the West.
[02:47:47.401 --> 02:48:05.506]  Their perfect scenario right now that they would be foaming at the mouth to report on would be a situation, whether it be a shooting or let's say a bombing or anything like that, some major event, some catastrophe, perhaps even, you know, a mass casualty event,
[02:48:06.553 --> 02:48:13.478]  That they can spin and then blame on conservatives, blame on Republicans, blame on the alt-right.
[02:48:13.578 --> 02:48:15.119]  You've seen them try it before.
[02:48:15.139 --> 02:48:16.801]  They tried it with the Charlottesville thing.
[02:48:17.161 --> 02:48:17.861]  That failed.
[02:48:18.142 --> 02:48:22.205]  They tried it by saying that Trump supporters are violent at their rallies.
[02:48:22.305 --> 02:48:23.145]  That narrative failed.
[02:48:23.185 --> 02:48:25.167]  It was always the leftists going and starting violence.
[02:48:25.427 --> 02:48:26.848]  Same thing happened in Charlottesville.
[02:48:27.468 --> 02:48:33.773]  So they need a mass event that they can either blame on conservatives or blame on
[02:48:35.214 --> 02:48:42.047]  Retired members of the military and veterans and it's a talking point that they've been bringing up for a long time They've tried to pin it to Alex Jones.
[02:48:42.067 --> 02:48:43.690]  They try to pin it to conservative media
[02:48:44.847 --> 02:48:46.328]  So that would be their perfect event.
[02:48:46.968 --> 02:49:08.080]  And if they think they can get some wind-up doll to go out there in a controlled event where he's already on their radar, he's already brought up red flags, and you let him go, but then you control the situation because he's already on your radar, so then you can blame it on, oh, he maybe watched an Alex Jones video or a Paul Joseph Watson video or something, and then they create a media narrative
[02:49:08.991 --> 02:49:12.213]  That says we caused him to do that, now we have to be shut down.
[02:49:12.894 --> 02:49:16.436]  And the background is all the lawsuits, the background is all the fake news on Alex Jones.
[02:49:16.476 --> 02:49:18.858]  So, Matt Bracken, you're the expert on this.
[02:49:18.978 --> 02:49:20.419]  EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com.
[02:49:20.439 --> 02:49:22.120]  You've written multiple books about this.
[02:49:23.661 --> 02:49:25.442]  What do you think they're thinking right now in the media?
[02:49:25.462 --> 02:49:32.887]  Because you had the ISIS propaganda coming out and they have their gun aimed at CNN, which I think is total BS.
[02:49:33.147 --> 02:49:34.468]  I think CNN loves ISIS.
[02:49:34.808 --> 02:49:37.409]  I think, you know, so I don't know why that would happen.
[02:49:37.469 --> 02:49:39.971]  It kind of seems like maybe fake propaganda there.
[02:49:40.711 --> 02:49:44.173]  But what do you think the media would do if an event like this happened?
[02:49:44.233 --> 02:49:44.434]  I mean,
[02:49:45.367 --> 02:49:54.430]  We say, hey, this looks like it might be a radical Islamic terror attack, and they attack us, but you know they would jump on a narrative as soon as they could if they could blame it on a Trump supporter.
[02:49:55.951 --> 02:50:04.593]  Yeah, and I think they would goad Trump supporters or someone that could be portrayed as, you know, from the alt-right if they could.
[02:50:05.134 --> 02:50:12.516]  But, you know, over the year and a half since Trump's been elected, you know, we've seen the assassination of Trump in the park.
[02:50:13.246 --> 02:50:23.449]  By, you know, a well-known group of theatrical players stabbing Trump to death or holding up his bloody head.
[02:50:23.989 --> 02:50:27.750]  These are signals to the loose cannons that you'll be praised.
[02:50:27.790 --> 02:50:28.850]  You'll be somebody.
[02:50:29.210 --> 02:50:34.972]  Your worthless life will have meaning if you make our dreams come true and assassinate the president.
[02:50:35.592 --> 02:50:38.753]  But I think that there are other actors who would say, you know,
[02:50:39.426 --> 02:50:54.055]  What we need to do is shoot up a feminist rally or a Black Lives Matter rally and leave clues pointing at the conservatives because they know for a fact that the media would not look at it critically as a false flag in any way.
[02:50:54.735 --> 02:50:56.677]  They would run with the narrative immediately.
[02:50:57.477 --> 02:50:58.938]  We saw this in Syria with
[02:50:59.531 --> 02:51:05.061]  What is, I would say, you know, at least an 80-20 chance it was a false flag attack against Assad.
[02:51:05.081 --> 02:51:07.004]  I mean, it makes no sense, the timing.
[02:51:07.024 --> 02:51:08.526]  Yeah, I mean, it's like, it's like a hundred percent.
[02:51:08.546 --> 02:51:09.949]  But the important thing is the media ran with the story.
[02:51:09.989 --> 02:51:13.435]  The media just went with it as if it was an established fact.
[02:51:14.290 --> 02:51:21.013]  Before there was any proof, and there still is no proof, but they ran with it as an established fact to the point of firing missiles.
[02:51:21.553 --> 02:51:24.575]  So yeah, the media would immediately say, this is the conservatives.
[02:51:24.995 --> 02:51:26.255]  They've just done a massacre.
[02:51:26.296 --> 02:51:28.296]  It's another reason to go after guns.
[02:51:28.957 --> 02:51:31.838]  I think if it happens, it will definitely be a gun, probably an AR-15.
[02:51:31.978 --> 02:51:39.001]  Yeah, then they can use the narrative not only against conservatives, but then of course go after the guns.
[02:51:39.021 --> 02:51:40.422]  That's one of their favorite things to do.
[02:51:42.322 --> 02:52:05.886]  I would have never thought this before, but after Garland, Texas, with an actual active-duty, card-carrying FBI special agent following behind the terrorists, goading them to commit mass murder for a political objective, I wouldn't be surprised if the FBI has its eye on certain loose cannons that are roaming around right now.
[02:52:06.853 --> 02:52:16.335]  And depending on the political desires, either stopping them or dropping the ball again, depending on the desired outcome.
[02:52:16.715 --> 02:52:30.718]  For example, if these Strzok page messages have bombshells in them that are going to completely blow up Mueller's investigation and make the Democrats look like traitors and Russian colluders,
[02:52:31.508 --> 02:52:38.511]  That's when one of these wind-up dolls, the FBI might suddenly lose track of him and then something happens.
[02:52:38.551 --> 02:52:39.771]  Well, let's be perfectly clear.
[02:52:40.131 --> 02:52:41.372]  That's what happened in Florida.
[02:52:41.472 --> 02:52:43.672]  The FBI knew Cruz was on the wash lift.
[02:52:43.752 --> 02:52:46.173]  I mean, dozens if not hundreds of red flags.
[02:52:46.313 --> 02:52:50.755]  Totally knew who he was and then there was the stand-down at the scene.
[02:52:50.775 --> 02:52:53.056]  So you got that aspect of things.
[02:52:54.036 --> 02:52:59.370]  And then you talk about the controlled aspect of, you know, oh, is the FBI behind this or CIA?
[02:52:59.711 --> 02:53:02.558]  We now have the documents that just got released.
[02:53:03.742 --> 02:53:04.803]  Unintentionally, apparently.
[02:53:05.423 --> 02:53:13.069]  How the government can use radiation coming out of cell phones to manipulate your mind and put voices in your head.
[02:53:13.369 --> 02:53:25.238]  So then you've got that aspect, if you've got crazies out there, plus some crazy technology a government or some other entity has, where they can hack into your cell phone and then use that to literally control you like MKUltra.
[02:53:25.598 --> 02:53:26.699]  People say, oh, you're crazy.
[02:53:26.979 --> 02:53:27.660]  No, look it up!
[02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:34.424]  These are published documents that use electronic waves to manipulate your mind and make you act crazy.
[02:53:34.464 --> 02:53:36.745]  It's like right out of the movie Kingsman.
[02:53:37.446 --> 02:53:43.309]  And so we're dealing with all of this, but people need to understand that the media will try to create a narrative.
[02:53:43.689 --> 02:53:44.630]  That's what it's all about.
[02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:47.932]  It's all about creating a narrative, just like hands up, don't shoot.
[02:53:48.372 --> 02:53:49.073]  Never happened.
[02:53:49.693 --> 02:53:54.856]  Totally disproven, disproven in the courts, yet still to this day they do hands up, don't shoot.
[02:53:55.076 --> 02:53:59.318]  Just like still to this day they say, oh gay frogs are a real thing, there's no scientific evidence.
[02:53:59.598 --> 02:54:04.421]  So it's all about creating that first narrative, and then that sinks into the brainwashed people's minds.
[02:54:04.621 --> 02:54:06.462]  The truth never, never penetrates.
[02:54:07.262 --> 02:54:09.923]  Yeah, I'm reading, I don't know why it took me so long.
[02:54:10.564 --> 02:54:14.265]  Right now I'm reading a terrific book, one of the best books I've ever read.
[02:54:14.866 --> 02:54:16.967]  American Betrayal by Diana West.
[02:54:17.998 --> 02:54:29.967]  And it gets into this, you know, in the 50s and 60s, really starting in the 30s, the communist networks were covered up so effectively, McCarthy ended up being the villain and he was a hero.
[02:54:30.367 --> 02:54:30.708]  He was right.
[02:54:30.728 --> 02:54:37.973]  And what people remember of that era is red baiting and, you know, communists under the bed, and it became a joke, a running gag.
[02:54:38.373 --> 02:54:39.294]  But it really happened.
[02:54:39.714 --> 02:54:42.977]  And the objective neutral truth really doesn't matter anymore.
[02:54:43.557 --> 02:54:47.059]  It's what narrative can be pounded home over and over again.
[02:54:47.459 --> 02:55:02.268]  That's why we've seen hundreds of movies with the German Third Reich Nazis as the villains, and you can count on one hand any movies that portrayed global communism, Russian, Chinese, Cambodian, any of them,
[02:55:02.968 --> 02:55:08.273]  As the great villains that they were, killing at least 100 million in the 20th century.
[02:55:08.733 --> 02:55:15.779]  So objective reality is not as important as keeping a false narrative going with a drumbeat of lies.
[02:55:15.879 --> 02:55:16.459]  And it works.
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:18.101]  Brainwashing works.
[02:55:18.261 --> 02:55:19.302]  It absolutely works.
[02:55:19.742 --> 02:55:20.963]  And there's no doubt in my mind.
[02:55:21.464 --> 02:55:27.849]  That thing about the mind control that was leaked from the Fusion Center, or dropped out by the Fusion Center,
[02:55:29.454 --> 02:55:37.866]  I don't think that would work on normal people, but if they've got somebody who's already hearing voices, they can probably dial him up or dial him down.
[02:55:38.788 --> 02:55:40.030]  Provoke him, for example.
[02:55:42.463 --> 02:55:42.904]  We're good to go.
[02:55:59.764 --> 02:56:07.788]  Mueller, it's so funny, Mueller, when he was head of the FBI, that was when they gutted the realistic counter-jihad training.
[02:56:08.288 --> 02:56:20.593]  So you can make an actual case that Fort Hood, Boston, San Bernardino, Orlando, and many other attacks, they happened because the FBI had blinders put on them.
[02:56:21.313 --> 02:56:24.495]  Mosques were put out of bounds for surveillance.
[02:56:25.075 --> 02:56:39.021]  This would be like in the 1930s if the German-American Bund was put out of bounds for surveillance and you needed to talk to a Nazi about true Nazi culture because we can't be Germanophobic.
[02:56:39.541 --> 02:56:40.761]  But that's where we are today.
[02:56:40.801 --> 02:56:42.582]  We're in a land of false narratives.
[02:56:42.622 --> 02:56:49.764]  A lot of Americans don't know their history and they don't know the lies that the media has been reporting on for years that they never correct.
[02:56:49.824 --> 02:56:53.186]  And you're going to talk more of this in the next hour as well.
[02:56:53.766 --> 02:56:58.908]  And just real quick, you mentioned the Stroke Page text that are about to come out and potential bombshells there.
[02:56:59.188 --> 02:57:00.928]  To me, we already have all the bombshells.
[02:57:01.008 --> 02:57:01.829]  We know what's in the text.
[02:57:01.869 --> 02:57:02.309]  We know it all.
[02:57:02.389 --> 02:57:02.869]  Everybody knows.
[02:57:03.129 --> 02:57:08.352]  Until these people actually get arrested and get tried in court and have to testify under oath, nothing's going to matter.
[02:57:08.392 --> 02:57:09.712]  That's the day this stuff matters.
[02:57:09.753 --> 02:57:10.713]  Until then, it probably doesn't.
[02:57:11.033 --> 02:57:16.116]  But the key is that InfoWars can get the narrative out there that the television news is not going to report.
[02:57:16.396 --> 02:57:19.918]  And that's why your support of InfoWarsStore.com is so imperative, folks.
[02:57:19.938 --> 02:57:22.139]  I didn't do a good job plugging while I sat in for Alex here.
[02:57:22.459 --> 02:57:24.660]  So please go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:27.382]  In fact, we've got meetings going on right now.
[02:57:28.202 --> 02:57:28.902]  Well, I won't say.
[02:57:30.956 --> 02:57:33.038]  They really want to try to shut us down, okay?
[02:57:33.118 --> 02:57:35.700]  I mean, the attempts to shut us down are real, folks.
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:41.085]  And we could sit here and talk about it three hours a day and give you all the gruesome details, but that's not what the audience wants.
[02:57:41.125 --> 02:57:43.367]  But, please support us at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:43.887 --> 02:57:48.231]  Huge specials, 50% off Supermail Vitality, Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.

[02:57:55.529 --> 02:57:56.369]  Desiree, thanks for holding.
[02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:57.390]  You're on the air from California.
[02:57:57.410 --> 02:57:57.670]  Go ahead.
[02:57:57.810 --> 02:58:01.672]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[02:58:01.812 --> 02:58:06.835]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[02:58:07.395 --> 02:58:12.918]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[02:58:13.858 --> 02:58:22.045]  Still that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[02:58:22.746 --> 02:58:25.588]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[02:58:26.269 --> 02:58:29.912]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, five days a week.
[02:58:30.012 --> 02:58:36.878]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[02:58:36.998 --> 02:58:37.298]  I'm just
[02:58:37.478 --> 02:58:41.640]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[02:58:42.041 --> 02:58:45.323]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[02:58:45.343 --> 02:58:50.285]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[02:58:50.786 --> 02:58:56.369]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[02:58:56.449 --> 02:59:00.952]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[02:59:01.812 --> 02:59:03.113]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[02:59:03.334 --> 02:59:08.639]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[02:59:08.659 --> 02:59:09.980]  I think you should just share her testimony.
[02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:10.180]  Yeah.
[02:59:10.341 --> 02:59:12.222]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[02:59:12.262 --> 02:59:13.083]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[02:59:13.123 --> 02:59:14.805]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[02:59:14.825 --> 02:59:15.786]  We really appreciate you.
[02:59:15.866 --> 02:59:16.867]  Keep up the fight.
[02:59:16.887 --> 02:59:18.309]  We need to take California back.
[02:59:18.329 --> 02:59:18.709]  Thank you, Desiree.
[02:59:18.769 --> 02:59:19.830]  We're going to go back and make more calls.
[02:59:19.870 --> 02:59:20.451]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[02:59:22.697 --> 02:59:24.578]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:59:24.618 --> 02:59:26.520]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:29.321]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:59:29.522 --> 02:59:30.322]  Alex Jones.
[02:59:30.422 --> 02:59:33.184]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:33.244 --> 02:59:36.446]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:59:36.486 --> 02:59:37.787]  He's deeply, I think, racist.
[02:59:37.887 --> 02:59:39.748]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:59:39.849 --> 02:59:41.650]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:59:41.670 --> 02:59:45.752]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[02:59:45.772 --> 02:59:46.913]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:46.993 --> 02:59:51.897]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:59:56.579 --> 03:00:00.220]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:00.260 --> 03:00:01.921]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:02.121 --> 03:00:06.383]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.483 --> 03:00:08.583]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:00:08.603 --> 03:00:09.544]  Well, Kanye West...
[03:00:23.829 --> 03:00:27.971]  Was guilty of trumping while black about a year ago.
[03:00:28.051 --> 03:00:29.192]  He was trumping while black.
[03:00:29.532 --> 03:00:32.994]  So the thought police had to throw him in the gulag and he was silent for a little while.
[03:00:33.854 --> 03:00:34.614]  Now he's back.
[03:00:34.654 --> 03:00:35.735]  He's saying he loves Trump.
[03:00:35.775 --> 03:00:39.317]  He likes the way that Candace Owen thinks and the entire
[03:00:40.117 --> 03:00:53.668]  Entertainment industry is freaking out because their propaganda only works if it has the facade of unanimosity behind it of the entire Hollywood and entertainment industry is behind hating Trump.
[03:00:53.688 --> 03:00:54.289]  He's bad.
[03:00:54.549 --> 03:00:58.472]  Well, if one steps out of line, oh my gosh, it could trigger free thinking.
[03:00:58.872 --> 03:00:59.573]  We can't have that.
[03:00:59.613 --> 03:01:00.954]  We have to get Kanye back in line.
[03:01:01.334 --> 03:01:01.695]  So then
[03:01:02.748 --> 03:01:08.990]  Stephen Colbert, on his show last night, says Kanye West has lost his mind for supporting Trump.
[03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:17.372]  So, of course, the black man decides to think freely and leave it to the white man to just kick him right back down and put him back in line.
[03:01:17.412 --> 03:01:18.332]  That's Stephen Colbert.
[03:01:18.372 --> 03:01:22.314]  The black man, Kanye West, thinks freely and then the white man kicks him back into line.
[03:01:22.594 --> 03:01:24.374]  Stephen Colbert says he's lost his mind.
[03:01:24.694 --> 03:01:30.396]  We went out on the streets of Austin, Texas and thought, hmm, I wonder what the students at UT think about all this.
[03:01:39.997 --> 03:01:41.258]  Nothing like, I am a god.
[03:01:41.738 --> 03:01:43.380]  Everybody says, who does he think he is?
[03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:45.661]  I just told you who I thought I was!
[03:01:45.921 --> 03:01:46.402]  A god!
[03:01:46.982 --> 03:01:48.183]  Let the bass kick.
[03:01:54.007 --> 03:01:55.749]  This is Savannah Hernandez with InfoWars.
[03:01:55.769 --> 03:02:02.814]  Today we're on UT's campus to talk to students about what they think about the recent controversy surrounding Kanye West's tweets and his support of Candace Owens.
[03:02:03.014 --> 03:02:03.955]  Let's go see what people think.
[03:02:09.233 --> 03:02:10.835]  You ain't got the answers, man!
[03:02:10.855 --> 03:02:12.316]  You ain't got the answers, Dwayne!
[03:02:12.336 --> 03:02:16.140]  Kanye just tweeted a picture of himself wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:17.121]  What do you think about that?
[03:02:17.342 --> 03:02:18.423]  Didn't he come out as pro-Trump?
[03:02:18.443 --> 03:02:21.045]  I mean, so he's pro-Trump.
[03:02:22.006 --> 03:02:22.707]  What do you think about that?
[03:02:23.228 --> 03:02:25.290]  I didn't really have an opinion anyway to begin.
[03:02:25.330 --> 03:02:28.053]  I listened to Kanye before Trump ran for election, so...
[03:02:28.866 --> 03:02:31.327]  So his political views don't sway your opinion of him at all?
[03:02:32.347 --> 03:02:34.368]  Um, not necessarily Kanye.
[03:02:34.448 --> 03:02:41.050]  I feel like a political opinion can sway your opinion of a lot of celebrities and entertainers, but Kanye is kind of like Kanye where he's just too big to fail.
[03:02:41.490 --> 03:02:43.451]  So, it's just kind of like that.
[03:02:43.531 --> 03:02:45.072]  I mean, he can come out and say whatever he wants.
[03:02:45.132 --> 03:02:46.432]  I feel like people are still going to listen to him.
[03:02:47.593 --> 03:02:48.753]  I think it's perfectly fine.
[03:02:49.573 --> 03:02:53.955]  He's given out his First Amendment rights to discuss what political candidates he likes.
[03:02:55.182 --> 03:02:56.663]  I think that's perfectly fine, you know?
[03:02:56.704 --> 03:03:08.495]  I know some people are freaking out about it, but it's like, to be honest, we live in a democracy, so it's like, I'd expect people in high positions to give their opinions.
[03:03:08.515 --> 03:03:12.659]  It's just that what's happening is people don't like the fact that he's not supporting the guy that they like.
[03:03:13.761 --> 03:03:14.742]  I'm really happy for you.
[03:03:14.822 --> 03:03:15.542]  I'm gonna let you finish.
[03:03:16.548 --> 03:03:16.828]  I don't know.
[03:03:16.848 --> 03:03:17.808]  I'm not a fan of that.
[03:03:17.929 --> 03:03:20.930]  I like his music, but I don't appreciate that as a Kanye fan.
[03:03:20.970 --> 03:03:21.570]  That's not what's up.
[03:03:22.350 --> 03:03:22.770]  I don't know.
[03:03:23.010 --> 03:03:25.591]  I'm kind of questioning now whether or not to continue supporting him.
[03:03:26.171 --> 03:03:26.471]  I don't know.
[03:03:26.491 --> 03:03:28.352]  I haven't really invested in much of his stuff lately.
[03:03:28.552 --> 03:03:32.273]  I mean, I'll listen to his music, some of his older stuff, but I mean, I don't know.
[03:03:32.293 --> 03:03:37.055]  We'll see about what he's produced, you know, what's come out lately and everything like that.
[03:03:37.075 --> 03:03:38.115]  So, I don't know.
[03:03:38.175 --> 03:03:39.936]  I'm not really a fan of that, that he's supporting Trump.
[03:03:42.395 --> 03:03:45.216]  I mean, he has his own political affiliation, so that's cool.
[03:03:45.636 --> 03:03:52.600]  I mean, it's a good thing, I think, that he's not falling under what a lot of celebrities seem to be saying when he's speaking out for a different political affiliation.
[03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:58.902]  Yeah, so he actually recently tweeted, you know, we have freedom of speech, but we don't have freedom of thought.
[03:03:58.922 --> 03:03:59.723]  What do you think about that?
[03:04:01.363 --> 03:04:02.524]  Well, if he's speaking about
[03:04:04.241 --> 03:04:10.604]  Censorship in the media and certain platforms and I get what he's saying, but I mean we could still think whatever we want.
[03:04:10.624 --> 03:04:16.166]  We don't have a police like attacking citizens or incarcerating citizens because of certain thoughts.
[03:04:16.206 --> 03:04:19.908]  Maybe some European countries have that going on, but we don't have that in the United States currently.
[03:04:21.587 --> 03:04:27.511]  Can I ask you guys a couple questions about the controversy surrounding Kanye West and his recent tweets in support of Candace Owens?
[03:04:28.231 --> 03:04:29.472]  I have not read anything about that.
[03:04:29.492 --> 03:04:30.012]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:30.233 --> 03:04:31.794]  You ain't been doing the education!
[03:04:31.934 --> 03:04:32.234]  Bro!
[03:04:32.314 --> 03:04:33.835]  You ain't been doing the education!
[03:04:34.355 --> 03:04:38.638]  I don't want to be insulting, but I don't think Kanye himself really understands what Trump is doing.
[03:04:38.958 --> 03:04:44.922]  He just sees, like, the few little things that they show on CNN and stuff, and he supports that, which is not good.
[03:04:45.062 --> 03:04:49.165]  Because if you're going to be somebody's supporter, you have to do your research and do your background information about that person.
[03:04:49.738 --> 03:04:50.939]  But that's just my personal opinion.
[03:04:50.979 --> 03:04:58.306]  He probably could know, but I'm just saying, because, honestly, I don't think anybody that really truly understands what Trump is doing, especially with the stuff in Syria, where we're trying to support his actions.
[03:04:58.366 --> 03:04:59.186]  But that's just...
[03:05:03.647 --> 03:05:05.349]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[03:06:00.496 --> 03:06:11.280]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:06:11.881 --> 03:06:15.422]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:06:25.393 --> 03:06:29.116]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[03:06:29.136 --> 03:06:30.298]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[03:06:30.378 --> 03:06:31.238]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:31.339 --> 03:06:32.219]  From Infowars.
[03:06:32.239 --> 03:06:32.920]  Infowars.
[03:06:32.980 --> 03:06:33.160]  Yeah.
[03:06:33.300 --> 03:06:33.961]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:34.061 --> 03:06:34.862]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:34.882 --> 03:06:38.325]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:06:38.385 --> 03:06:41.168]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[03:06:41.248 --> 03:06:45.972]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:06:46.172 --> 03:06:50.816]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[03:06:50.976 --> 03:06:52.998]  He just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[03:06:53.899 --> 03:06:56.180]  I'm already not Alex Jones so I know the truth!
[03:06:56.220 --> 03:07:07.370]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according to website InfoWars.
[03:07:07.430 --> 03:07:09.672]  And this really, this is so disgusting.
[03:07:09.692 --> 03:07:12.234]  The juice of these pickles is on you Alex Jones.
[03:07:15.859 --> 03:07:18.580]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:21.201]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[03:07:21.742 --> 03:07:27.884]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[03:07:27.924 --> 03:07:30.125]  If Trump gets elected, he's going to be Secretary of Defense.
[03:07:30.145 --> 03:07:32.206]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[03:07:32.306 --> 03:07:33.166]  Move, bitch!
[03:07:33.507 --> 03:07:34.627]  Get out the way!
[03:07:34.767 --> 03:07:36.428]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[03:07:36.468 --> 03:07:38.209]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:07:39.750 --> 03:07:40.871]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:07:41.071 --> 03:07:42.013]  Infowars.com.
[03:07:42.113 --> 03:07:43.154]  Infowars.com.
[03:07:43.194 --> 03:07:44.055]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:07:44.236 --> 03:07:46.338]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[03:07:49.923 --> 03:07:53.848]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:07:54.449 --> 03:07:56.031]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:07:57.256 --> 03:07:59.257]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:59.877 --> 03:08:00.657]  I'm pinch-hitting.
[03:08:00.917 --> 03:08:07.940]  I'm Roger Stone, your host for the next hour, and joining me in hosting our next hour is Matt Bracken.
[03:08:08.900 --> 03:08:12.281]  We are delighted to be with you so much in the news.
[03:08:12.641 --> 03:08:13.742]  There he is, Matt Bracken.
[03:08:14.342 --> 03:08:14.822]  Welcome back.
[03:08:16.567 --> 03:08:17.367]  Welcome back, yes.
[03:08:17.767 --> 03:08:18.327]  Good to see you.
[03:08:18.367 --> 03:08:23.509]  So, some substantial news today regarding the John F. Kennedy assassination.
[03:08:24.669 --> 03:08:35.172]  The President, in accordance with the 1994 JFK Document Release Act, ordered the release of the remaining 19,045 documents pertaining to the murder of the President.
[03:08:40.173 --> 03:08:53.664]  No document was completely withheld in full upon the President's orders and redactions based on the President's instructions are only to regard those who are currently living.
[03:08:55.146 --> 03:09:00.690]  Interestingly enough, the intelligence agencies had requested a further delay.
[03:09:01.290 --> 03:09:08.817]  The President ordered them to be extremely circumspect in recommending any further postponement
[03:09:09.677 --> 03:09:25.445]  And he said the material that has been withheld to date is to be re-reviewed by October 26, 2021, not that far away, to determine whether there's any continuing use reason why this government information should be withheld.
[03:09:28.587 --> 03:09:37.916]  Now, in the past, we have learned an extraordinary amount about the JFK assassination from these release documents.
[03:09:37.996 --> 03:09:51.609]  For example, we learned that the KGB had conducted their own independent investigation into the John F. Kennedy assassination and had determined that Lyndon Johnson was the perp.
[03:09:52.290 --> 03:10:00.476]  We actually saw in the government release records a memo from J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI, to President Johnson informing him of that.
[03:10:01.076 --> 03:10:07.140]  We also learned that the French intelligence conducted their own independent review at the request of Jacqueline Kennedy.
[03:10:07.861 --> 03:10:13.645]  They also concurred that Lyndon Johnson was a major orchestrator of the plot.
[03:10:14.425 --> 03:10:20.927]  We learned that President Lyndon Johnson belonged to the Ku Klux Klan early in his congressional career.
[03:10:21.907 --> 03:10:25.267]  We learned about George H.W.
[03:10:25.307 --> 03:10:33.409]  Bush's presence in Dallas on the 21st and 22nd of November 1963.
[03:10:34.109 --> 03:10:40.651]  For 30 years, former President George Bush said that he couldn't remember where he was that day.
[03:10:41.351 --> 03:10:45.434]  Matt Bracken will tell you, everyone remembers where they were that day.
[03:10:46.675 --> 03:10:48.517]  Anybody who was old enough to think.
[03:10:49.738 --> 03:10:56.283]  But we also saw in the release documents memos between George H.W.
[03:10:56.323 --> 03:10:56.563]  Bush
[03:10:57.804 --> 03:11:21.889]  Who called the Houston FBI minutes after the President was shot, essentially to establish an alibi, saying that he was speaking in Tyler, Texas, and then leading the FBI on a wild goose chase regarding a young Republican in Harris County that he said may or may not have made threats against the President.
[03:11:22.869 --> 03:11:28.731]  I think Russ Baker, in his terrific book on the Bushes, highlighted this revelation.
[03:11:28.852 --> 03:11:39.456]  So, I have not had an opportunity to examine the material that was released today, but so far it is consistent with everything the President told me he would do.
[03:11:39.976 --> 03:11:41.877]  He favors transparency.
[03:11:42.757 --> 03:11:49.762]  Why, you may ask, would the intelligence agencies be opposed to the release of this material?
[03:11:50.283 --> 03:11:58.148]  Particularly since those involved in these events 55 years ago are almost certainly dead and no longer with us.
[03:11:58.889 --> 03:12:03.973]  Well, the real reason, I think, is because they don't want to expose their methods.
[03:12:04.915 --> 03:12:07.536]  They leaked then, they leak now.
[03:12:08.177 --> 03:12:11.818]  They fabricate things then, they fabricate things now.
[03:12:12.419 --> 03:12:15.720]  They assassinate then, they still assassinate today.
[03:12:16.721 --> 03:12:22.803]  So it speaks to the foundations of our rogue intelligence agencies.
[03:12:23.904 --> 03:12:28.166]  This is a monumental decision by the president today.
[03:12:28.806 --> 03:12:32.068]  Some will criticize the redactions, but I would point out
[03:12:32.748 --> 03:12:48.975]  That the 1994 John F. Kennedy Records Release Act requires that the archives and the intelligence agencies publish in writing the reasons for any withholdings or redactions in the Federal Register.
[03:12:49.915 --> 03:12:51.496]  They have not yet done that.
[03:12:52.616 --> 03:13:12.805]  I have urged Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina, who has been a real crusader for transparency on this issue, to look into the failure of the intelligence agencies to explain their redactions to date.
[03:13:13.385 --> 03:13:16.947]  Matt, do you have any reaction here to the JFK revelations?
[03:13:18.325 --> 03:13:21.886]  Well, I'm glad that Trump is leaning towards disclosure.
[03:13:22.887 --> 03:13:43.453]  I'll note that researchers that have been trying to follow up on a lot of untied threads of the communist networks operating in the 50s and 60s find that the archives are missing information, that physical documents have been taken out and misplaced or destroyed.
[03:13:44.014 --> 03:13:47.795]  So when they try to go back and look at these documents, they can't find them.
[03:13:48.439 --> 03:14:03.377]  I don't know if all of these documents have been kept in secure places or if people like Sandy Berger, who was trying to clean up behind Bill Clinton, going into the Library of Congress to remove
[03:14:05.089 --> 03:14:06.790]  You know, damaging information.
[03:14:07.291 --> 03:14:12.614]  It'll be interesting to see what damaging information is still left, or if it's been sanitized.
[03:14:12.694 --> 03:14:25.903]  Yeah, you bring up a famous incident in which Berger went into the National Archives, they assign a docent who spends time with you, he tells the docent, I have to take a classified telephone call, can you step out?
[03:14:26.003 --> 03:14:31.347]  While he steps out, Berger takes documents, shoves them down the front of his pants, and leaves.
[03:14:32.047 --> 03:14:34.128]  How much time did he spend in jail for this crime?
[03:14:35.049 --> 03:14:35.309]  None.
[03:14:35.670 --> 03:14:36.070]  Zero.
[03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:44.776]  But he was trying to cover up the fact that Bill Clinton could have taken out Bin Laden, had the opportunity, and passed on it.
[03:14:45.837 --> 03:14:47.398]  But you remind me of that.
[03:14:47.518 --> 03:14:50.860]  Now, it's also interesting that the National Archives
[03:14:51.841 --> 03:15:06.149]  Last November released 667 documents ahead of the of the August deadline or pardon me the July deadline and almost all of those documents were heavily redacted.
[03:15:06.849 --> 03:15:11.875]  I almost wonder whether that was a test to see what public reaction would be.
[03:15:11.895 --> 03:15:23.049]  The 96 documents released on that day are completely and totally worthless to scholars or researchers or reporters trying to figure out what happened on November 22, 1963.
[03:15:25.371 --> 03:15:38.374]  It was not until after that that the President became aware of his responsibilities under the 1994 Act and ordered the release of these documents to the consternation of our intelligence services.
[03:15:39.414 --> 03:15:41.895]  Good move today by President Donald Trump.
[03:15:42.435 --> 03:15:47.436]  I'm Roger Stone, you're on the Alex Jones Show with my friend Matt Bracken, and we'll be right back.
[03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:55.854]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:15:55.874 --> 03:15:58.116]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:16:02.219 --> 03:16:16.452]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard and Yale.
[03:16:18.948 --> 03:16:25.070]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[03:16:26.470 --> 03:16:29.011]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[03:16:29.812 --> 03:16:33.213]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[03:16:34.153 --> 03:16:36.334]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[03:16:38.034 --> 03:16:43.176]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[03:16:45.151 --> 03:16:51.757]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[03:16:52.738 --> 03:16:53.739]  It's up to us personally.
[03:16:55.140 --> 03:17:01.986]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[03:17:02.486 --> 03:17:03.788]  I expected that to happen.
[03:17:04.969 --> 03:17:06.310]  This is 21st century warfare.
[03:17:08.294 --> 03:17:19.200]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:21.461]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[03:17:22.142 --> 03:17:33.768]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[03:17:34.348 --> 03:17:36.550]  And we've already come so far together
[03:17:37.574 --> 03:17:46.596]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[03:17:47.156 --> 03:17:52.578]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[03:17:53.698 --> 03:18:01.560]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[03:18:03.823 --> 03:18:12.091]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[03:18:12.411 --> 03:18:14.053]  That's a conservative estimate.
[03:18:15.054 --> 03:18:17.716]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[03:18:18.517 --> 03:18:20.339]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[03:18:20.379 --> 03:18:25.263]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[03:18:26.364 --> 03:18:37.138]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[03:18:37.198 --> 03:18:41.143]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[03:18:42.566 --> 03:18:43.206]  Our game is changing.
[03:18:59.477 --> 03:19:03.841]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids, it just does incredible things.
[03:19:04.261 --> 03:19:05.742]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[03:19:06.143 --> 03:19:08.725]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[03:19:08.745 --> 03:19:11.327]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:19:11.808 --> 03:19:16.632]  That's 4-5-a-colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[03:19:17.272 --> 03:19:19.935]  We now have not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue
[03:19:20.675 --> 03:19:28.380]  Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of coital silver out there.
[03:19:28.841 --> 03:19:35.725]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[03:19:35.785 --> 03:19:37.066]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[03:19:37.266 --> 03:19:38.447]  You can swallow it as well.
[03:19:38.848 --> 03:19:44.832]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:19:45.452 --> 03:19:46.833]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:19:46.853 --> 03:19:56.440]  So thank you all for remembering Infowarsstore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:19:56.760 --> 03:19:59.823]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:20:06.728 --> 03:20:09.350]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.634 --> 03:20:27.799]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:20:28.339 --> 03:20:33.981]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:20:35.642 --> 03:20:36.302]  Welcome back.
[03:20:37.603 --> 03:20:41.024]  I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:42.091 --> 03:20:52.713]  We were involved in a discussion with Matt Bracken regarding the release of the JFK assassination documents this morning by President Donald Trump.
[03:20:53.433 --> 03:21:10.996]  But we kind of segued into a broader conversation addressing an interview that the President gave to Fox & Friends this morning in which he intimated, in response to a question regarding Russian collusion, that he is close to taking control of his own Justice Department.
[03:21:12.216 --> 03:21:15.997]  Matt and I agree that it's long past time that he do that.
[03:21:16.577 --> 03:21:31.621]  And then last week, you had the Attorney General Jeff Sessions saying publicly that if the President fired Rod Rosenstein, the number two man in the department, but really the de facto Attorney General today, well that he
[03:21:33.300 --> 03:21:34.701]  Sessions would step down.
[03:21:35.241 --> 03:21:37.702]  He seemed to back off that slightly.
[03:21:38.702 --> 03:21:40.123]  But make my day.
[03:21:40.143 --> 03:21:42.364]  I mean, Matt, please make my day.
[03:21:43.204 --> 03:21:47.826]  The amount of power the president has, I'm not sure he really understands.
[03:21:48.607 --> 03:21:52.868]  The Justice Department is an extension of the executive branch.
[03:21:53.329 --> 03:21:56.650]  He has full authority to direct their activities.
[03:21:57.490 --> 03:22:00.572]  But what we have instead is the Trump Justice Department
[03:22:01.192 --> 03:22:20.908]  Ignoring the crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas that include unconstitutional, illegal surveillance, the creation of fabricated evidence for the purposes of rationalizing that surveillance, the disappearance of records, the misappropriation of monies.
[03:22:21.628 --> 03:22:25.752]  All of those crimes, including the crimes of the Clinton Foundation, go unexplored.
[03:22:26.412 --> 03:22:27.813]  The sale of 20% of our uranium stock
[03:22:29.995 --> 03:22:30.595]  Unscathed.
[03:22:31.316 --> 03:22:46.405]  Meanwhile, we have a witch hunt looking into the Trump campaign and Trump's many associates without yet today a scintilla of evidence of Russian collusion, conspiracy, or coordination.
[03:22:47.365 --> 03:22:48.146]  Matt, what's your take?
[03:22:48.854 --> 03:22:59.958]  Yeah, I think that the key, like the Rosetta Stone of this, is to understand how did Rosenstein become the acting Attorney General?
[03:23:00.018 --> 03:23:01.399]  Who put him forward for that?
[03:23:02.199 --> 03:23:12.043]  If we understood the machinations behind his being installed as deputy, I think we'll understand the larger outlines of this plot.
[03:23:12.603 --> 03:23:16.785]  Because clearly he was put in there to trigger Trump to fire Comey
[03:23:17.521 --> 03:23:22.342]  And then that would trigger a special counsel where he would name Comey's friend Robert Mueller.
[03:23:22.903 --> 03:23:24.523]  These are all corruptocrats.
[03:23:25.103 --> 03:23:31.745]  Rosenstein, Mueller, and Weissman all could go to prison for Uranium One.
[03:23:32.205 --> 03:23:35.426]  This, to me, gives them a strong motive to try to take out Trump.
[03:23:36.124 --> 03:23:47.332]  If there's an honest investigation into the last 10 years of the Uranium One scandal, we're talking $145 million going to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:23:47.712 --> 03:23:48.853]  That's not chicken feed.
[03:23:48.873 --> 03:23:51.034]  If you withheld $1,400 from the IRS, they want their money.
[03:23:57.399 --> 03:23:59.421]  145 million and there's no investigation.
[03:24:00.021 --> 03:24:06.286]  And Mueller, Rosenstein, and Weissman, who are all involved in that, hold the key to Trump's future.
[03:24:06.846 --> 03:24:07.727]  It's just crazy.
[03:24:08.067 --> 03:24:13.211]  This morning, the President said that he might be soon taking over the reins of the DOJ.
[03:24:14.032 --> 03:24:20.457]  I'd like to see President Trump and Devin Nunes marching into the Department of Justice with U.S.
[03:24:20.517 --> 03:24:22.038]  Marshals saying,
[03:24:22.759 --> 03:24:24.781]  We're going to take the records out.
[03:24:24.822 --> 03:24:25.743]  We've got dollies.
[03:24:25.763 --> 03:24:27.825]  We've got some, you know, the workers behind us.
[03:24:28.225 --> 03:24:29.727]  We're removing them now.
[03:24:31.029 --> 03:24:37.516]  Are you rejecting an order from your president that runs this building and do the same thing at the FBI?
[03:24:37.957 --> 03:24:42.482]  And anybody who stands in front of those records and says you can't have them, handcuff them.
[03:24:43.022 --> 03:24:44.143]  Take the records out.
[03:24:45.484 --> 03:24:55.571]  One of the biggest aspects of this scandal that has gotten almost no attention is that Strzok is a social friend of the FISA Court Judge Rudy Contreras.
[03:24:56.562 --> 03:25:02.727]  I mean, I love Sean Hannity, but he's always saying, boy, those FISA judges must be really mad that they were used.
[03:25:03.127 --> 03:25:04.469]  How do we know they were used?
[03:25:04.809 --> 03:25:07.751]  They might have been cooperating and planning this all along.
[03:25:08.131 --> 03:25:19.421]  There's that redacted email or text that says, we're going to have a meeting with Judge Rudy, but we need to make it a cocktail party and invite more people for cover for action.
[03:25:20.061 --> 03:25:22.742]  Cover for action is a term of tradecraft.
[03:25:23.602 --> 03:25:32.704]  That means how do we give ourselves a plausible reason for meeting somebody, otherwise it would be just a clandestine meeting between spies.
[03:25:33.144 --> 03:25:35.124]  We need to do it with a cover for action.
[03:25:35.584 --> 03:25:47.587]  This to me is a flagrant admission of guilty intent to meet the FISA judge out of church, you know, out of business hours to set this whole thing up.
[03:25:48.187 --> 03:25:52.890]  If the FISA court is as corrupt as the FBI is, where are we today?
[03:25:53.470 --> 03:26:02.635]  We've got a communist running the CIA by his own admission, voted for a communist in 1980 at the height of the Cold War, John Brennan.
[03:26:03.235 --> 03:26:06.117]  I mean, we've got Clapper lying repeatedly to Congress.
[03:26:06.798 --> 03:26:08.300]  They forget who runs who.
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:10.843]  Congress created the NSA.
[03:26:11.203 --> 03:26:13.125]  Congress created the CIA.
[03:26:13.666 --> 03:26:20.474]  Now they're off the leash, they've gone rogue, and they're trying to take out the president that's trying to put their collar back on.
[03:26:21.124 --> 03:26:24.086]  I mean, we are in the middle of a bureaucratic civil war right now.
[03:26:24.646 --> 03:26:42.397]  Nobody's being shot as of now, but day by day I expect canoe accidents, Fort Marcy Park bodies to be found, Admiral Borda suicides, because we're getting down to that period of this where there are people who are saying, if this guy testifies, I'm going to prison.
[03:26:43.177 --> 03:26:44.498]  It's time for an accident.
[03:26:44.938 --> 03:26:57.983]  You know, somebody's Mercedes is going to be Bluetooth enabled into a tree at 100 miles an hour like Michael Hastings after he had his sights set on John Brennan following his takedown of General Stanley McChrystal.
[03:26:58.709 --> 03:27:12.316]  I mean, these guys will stop at nothing at this point, and, you know, we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg above the water, but believe me, the sharks are circling down below, and, you know, there's blood in the water right now.
[03:27:12.436 --> 03:27:19.180]  With these Strock Page texts about to come out, literally anything could happen, including a false flag attack diversion.
[03:27:20.078 --> 03:27:34.993]  Some lunatic could be let off the FBI could drop the ball again in order to create a momentous distraction just as some of these more revelations about the corruption in the FBI and DOJ come out.
[03:27:35.433 --> 03:27:37.495]  Not to mention people like Brennan and Clapper.
[03:27:37.916 --> 03:27:40.158]  They're capable of doing literally anything.
[03:27:41.277 --> 03:27:45.200]  Matt, I think that's a very, very good analysis of the situation.
[03:27:45.220 --> 03:27:53.585]  I want to remind our listeners and our viewers that we here at InfoWars are completely and totally funded by you.
[03:27:53.745 --> 03:27:59.028]  We have no rich, conservative fat cats sitting in the wings writing us big checks.
[03:27:59.068 --> 03:28:05.372]  That's why I need you to go to the InfoWars.com site now and look at some of these extraordinary specials.
[03:28:05.853 --> 03:28:09.435]  We are the cutting edge when it comes to modern nutraceuticals.
[03:28:10.375 --> 03:28:13.238]  I particularly like Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:13.378 --> 03:28:17.261]  This show would not be possible without Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:17.661 --> 03:28:24.406]  I'm now stacking it with the Red Pill, which I think is the single best vitamin and mineral combination that I have found.
[03:28:24.747 --> 03:28:28.189]  They call this the body and mind combo.
[03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:31.632]  It is a great stack and right now $29.95 for Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:34.694 --> 03:28:43.899]  I find that this gives me mental clarity and mental energy around four o'clock in the afternoon when I start to flag, but the good news is it doesn't keep you up at night.
[03:28:43.939 --> 03:28:46.801]  You're not wired like you are with some of these energy drinks.
[03:28:47.181 --> 03:28:50.082]  So please, take a moment, go to the Infowars.com store.
[03:28:50.382 --> 03:28:55.005]  You're on the Alex Jones Show with Roger Stone and Matt Bracken, and we'll be right back.

[03:29:11.515 --> 03:29:19.578]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:29:19.918 --> 03:29:24.620]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:29:24.780 --> 03:29:31.503]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:29:31.583 --> 03:29:38.665]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:29:38.765 --> 03:29:45.608]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:29:45.788 --> 03:29:50.152]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:30:02.424 --> 03:30:04.305]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:30:04.345 --> 03:30:04.646]  Go ahead.
[03:30:05.559 --> 03:30:07.441]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:30:07.482 --> 03:30:16.912]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:30:18.014 --> 03:30:21.378]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[03:30:21.898 --> 03:30:24.259]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:30:24.459 --> 03:30:26.600]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:30:26.700 --> 03:30:27.101]  Thank you.
[03:30:27.761 --> 03:30:30.222]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:30:30.262 --> 03:30:34.004]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[03:30:34.564 --> 03:30:37.546]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:30:37.586 --> 03:30:38.566]  They are quality.

[03:30:43.529 --> 03:30:44.049]  Absolutely.
[03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:57.510]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.

[03:32:05.865 --> 03:32:07.186]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:32:07.667 --> 03:32:19.196]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:32:19.897 --> 03:32:25.001]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[03:32:25.761 --> 03:32:35.048]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:32:35.269 --> 03:32:39.932]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:32:40.433 --> 03:32:42.754]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:32:43.095 --> 03:32:44.436]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:32:44.836 --> 03:32:49.720]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[03:32:49.940 --> 03:32:51.882]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:15.996 --> 03:33:24.545]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.926 --> 03:33:27.849]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:30.832 --> 03:33:31.373]  Welcome back.
[03:33:32.435 --> 03:33:34.096]  The Talking Head's bringing us in there.
[03:33:34.896 --> 03:33:40.478]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones, and you're at Freedom Command Central.
[03:33:40.618 --> 03:33:42.078]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:42.898 --> 03:33:45.959]  In our last segment, Matt Bracken made a very good point.
[03:33:45.999 --> 03:33:53.782]  It was the Congress that created the NSA, created the Central Intelligence Agency, created all these alphabet soup
[03:33:54.382 --> 03:33:54.943]  We're good to go.
[03:34:09.534 --> 03:34:10.335]  As Democrats.
[03:34:11.095 --> 03:34:18.239]  One quarter of all Democratic challengers in competitive House districts have military or intelligence backgrounds.
[03:34:19.220 --> 03:34:26.925]  Intelligence backgrounds by far the largest subgroup of category of advocation.
[03:34:27.005 --> 03:34:28.245]  National security operatives 57.
[03:34:28.706 --> 03:34:28.986]  Lawyers 45.
[03:34:33.829 --> 03:34:41.115]  Government officials, 35, corporate executives, businessmen and wealthy individuals, 30, and other professionals, 19.
[03:34:42.496 --> 03:34:53.065]  Put another way, in the 102 primary elections recently held, 44 involved candidates with military intelligence backgrounds.
[03:34:54.246 --> 03:35:01.392]  Military intelligence candidates count for 10 of the 22 most competitive districts in the country.
[03:35:01.972 --> 03:35:06.593]  To me, this smacks of a separation of power issue.
[03:35:07.234 --> 03:35:25.459]  What we see here is a clear trend of intelligence types seeking to invade the Congress in order to subvert that body and, in essence, subvert the oversight authority of the Congress over our rogue intelligence agencies.
[03:35:26.099 --> 03:35:31.141]  Interestingly enough, you see no comparable move among Republican challengers.
[03:35:31.721 --> 03:35:33.142]  This is extraordinary.
[03:35:33.582 --> 03:35:34.263]  Matt, your thoughts?
[03:35:34.283 --> 03:35:39.426]  You know, the congressional oversight, you mean what's left of it?
[03:35:39.566 --> 03:35:49.311]  It's like a toothless puppy trying to, you know, pull down a pit bull because theoretically the toothless puppy is in charge of the pit bull.
[03:35:49.952 --> 03:35:55.235]  But, you know, when the CIA, remember, was not supposed to operate inside of the United States,
[03:35:56.027 --> 03:36:14.432]  Because the fear was that they would begin to run intelligence operations here, and that would morph into exactly what we have seen, which is the tools of intelligence operations, as opposed to intelligence gathering, intelligence operations being used at home, which is essentially what the frame-up of Donald Trump is.
[03:36:14.952 --> 03:36:23.654]  It's a rogue intelligence operation, starting with the end desire to get rid of Donald Trump before he can destroy the deep state,
[03:36:24.398 --> 03:36:35.164]  And then working backward from there to fabricate the Steele dossier, take it to a probably corrupt FISA court which would rubber stamp it, and they'd be off to their races.
[03:36:35.724 --> 03:36:38.286]  So that's at the national level.
[03:36:38.746 --> 03:36:39.967]  But at every other level,
[03:36:40.715 --> 03:36:49.858]  If these intelligence agencies think they're going to have a friendly operator now in congressional camouflage, what kind of help are they going to give them?
[03:36:50.378 --> 03:37:05.522]  You know, there's often a non-clear and intentionally non-clear distinction between active duty serving intelligence officers, retired, former, contract, etc.
[03:37:06.542 --> 03:37:08.583]  This is how, in the past,
[03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:17.034]  Former Green Berets and SEALs, they've been approached by people that they knew a decade earlier in some war zone as a CIA officer.
[03:37:17.794 --> 03:37:34.004]  And they don't always say clearly whether they are working under official orders or if they're now private, because there's this gray area where the active intelligence officers will get out, but they're still really in.
[03:37:34.044 --> 03:37:37.306]  It's called sheep dipping for one word for it.
[03:37:38.129 --> 03:37:41.510]  They're actually still in, but they pretend to be private citizens.
[03:37:42.111 --> 03:37:57.657]  So these former Green Berets and SEALs, they never know when they're dealing with some guy that they met long ago as a CIA officer, if the guy is legitimately acting on orders, or if he's gone rogue and he's operating under his own auspices.
[03:37:58.297 --> 03:38:09.681]  This is how, for example, when Michael Hastings' Mercedes blew up, you know, at full speed, I don't think that there's ever going to be a paper trail back to the CIA.
[03:38:10.201 --> 03:38:16.843]  But it's sort of like, you know, who will rid me of this troublesome priest?
[03:38:17.764 --> 03:38:27.607]  The intention is declared and people that want to curry favor, the cutouts, working with cutouts, eventually the action takes place.
[03:38:28.385 --> 03:38:31.328]  Yeah, and this has now come back to the United States.
[03:38:32.289 --> 03:38:39.976]  In 1963, Truman wrote a letter to the Washington Post that was actually literally pulled out of the Washington Post for decades afterwards.
[03:38:40.808 --> 03:38:47.934]  You know, explaining his fears that the CIA would become a Frankenstein monster, or already had become a Frankenstein monster.
[03:38:48.334 --> 03:38:50.816]  That was in December of 63, he wrote that.
[03:38:51.216 --> 03:38:52.037]  Curious timing.
[03:38:52.417 --> 03:38:53.918]  You know, right after the assassination.
[03:38:54.179 --> 03:38:57.962]  The letter ran for one edition, and then it was pulled.
[03:38:58.522 --> 03:39:04.046]  Truman said that signing the CIA into law was the biggest single mistake he ever made.
[03:39:06.008 --> 03:39:21.020]  I am very interested in the question of the FISA warrants because the New York Times reported on January 20th, 2017 that I was the subject of a FISA warrant along with Paul Manafort and Carter Page.
[03:39:21.961 --> 03:39:30.951]  A number of things that have happened since then that lead me to believe that the government has full access to my email and my communications.
[03:39:31.392 --> 03:39:40.381]  Therefore, today I filed a Freedom of Information request with approximately 40 different agencies of the government.
[03:39:41.082 --> 03:39:44.725]  Seeking information as to whether I was a subject to a FISA warrant.
[03:39:45.385 --> 03:39:47.607]  This is a precursor to a lawsuit.
[03:39:47.647 --> 03:39:51.610]  You have to ask formally and then be denied, which is what I expect.
[03:39:52.030 --> 03:39:54.332]  And then we'll move to the second stage.
[03:39:54.912 --> 03:39:59.876]  I do know that the government continues to deny that Paul Manafort was ever under surveillance.
[03:40:00.476 --> 03:40:04.920]  Even though the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times have all reported otherwise.
[03:40:05.681 --> 03:40:09.084]  And then there is the curious question of Carter Page.
[03:40:09.724 --> 03:40:11.225]  The appointment of a U.S.
[03:40:11.305 --> 03:40:17.911]  attorney in Utah to look into the FISA abuses is a head fake, in my opinion.
[03:40:18.472 --> 03:40:21.414]  It's not that Huber, the man appointed, is not a good man.
[03:40:21.474 --> 03:40:22.315]  I think he may be.
[03:40:22.835 --> 03:40:26.739]  He's been given no budget and no authority, unlike Robert Mueller.
[03:40:27.299 --> 03:40:30.003]  Therefore, I expect his probe to be very narrow.
[03:40:30.523 --> 03:40:40.557]  Also, I'm mindful of what happened when the House Committee on Assassinations attempted to investigate the FBI, the Secret Service, and the CIA.
[03:40:41.198 --> 03:40:42.679]  They were stonewalled.
[03:40:43.280 --> 03:40:45.661]  As Mr. Huber will be stonewalled.
[03:40:46.421 --> 03:41:10.848]  This was to take the pressure off of Jeff Sessions for his failure to appoint a second special prosecutor to look into the FISA warrant abuses, the Steele dossier, and that whole ugly story, which seems to me to lead right back to the Hillary Clinton campaign, but thanks to Peter Stroke's text message, leads us right back to Barack Obama.
[03:41:11.528 --> 03:41:14.729]  What did the President know, and when did he know it?
[03:41:15.409 --> 03:41:15.609]  Pat?
[03:41:16.589 --> 03:41:28.871]  Yeah, I think that partly they're trying to protect the upper echelons, but, you know, if McCabe, he has threatened, I think his terminology was something like, burn the whole damn house down, if he's indicted.
[03:41:28.891 --> 03:41:35.913]  If he's going to make the claim that he was acting under orders, that he was, you know,
[03:41:37.748 --> 03:41:42.932]  Cooperating with with Comey and Obama and indirectly Clapper and Brennan.
[03:41:43.673 --> 03:42:01.848]  If he starts pointing fingers that high, I think that he's going to need another level of life insurance and I would advise him strictly to not go bicycling or canoeing or jogging in Fort Marcy Park because I think that the man would be
[03:42:03.799 --> 03:42:06.302]  At serious risk of being Michael Hastings.
[03:42:06.882 --> 03:42:07.943]  Very serious risk.
[03:42:08.644 --> 03:42:13.148]  The other question that interests me today is discrepancy.
[03:42:13.609 --> 03:42:25.581]  Yesterday, True Pundit, who I found has had a terrific record of accuracy, said that the Russian woman lawyer, whose name I can never pronounce properly, Veselnitskaya,
[03:42:26.101 --> 03:42:31.165]  ...was allowed into the country at the time of her famous meeting with Donald Trump Jr.
[03:42:31.726 --> 03:42:34.028]  on a special visa that was approved by U.S.
[03:42:34.668 --> 03:42:36.610]  Attorney Preet Bharara.
[03:42:37.411 --> 03:42:41.154]  We will come back and review this question on the other side.
[03:42:47.579 --> 03:42:51.803]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:42:52.543 --> 03:42:54.065]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:43:02.154 --> 03:43:02.480]  Introdu-
[03:43:04.802 --> 03:43:23.088]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:23.188 --> 03:43:29.130]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:29.470 --> 03:43:30.150]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:33.431]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:34.071 --> 03:43:35.052]  And so much more.
[03:43:35.612 --> 03:43:36.752]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.973 --> 03:43:38.693]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:38.713 --> 03:43:44.396]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:44.516 --> 03:43:45.697]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:45.717 --> 03:43:47.658]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:47.738 --> 03:43:50.119]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:50.339 --> 03:43:51.580]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:51.760 --> 03:43:53.581]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:54.141 --> 03:43:54.741]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:54.841 --> 03:43:56.142]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:56.282 --> 03:43:57.463]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:04.102 --> 03:44:09.408]  Melania did not kick me out of the White House for installing coal-burning fireplaces.
[03:44:09.828 --> 03:44:11.049]  Fake news!
[03:44:11.690 --> 03:44:12.411]  Mr. President!
[03:44:13.152 --> 03:44:16.515]  Why are you throwing balls at my face, Kurt Cousins?
[03:44:16.735 --> 03:44:17.396]  It's Kirk.
[03:44:17.656 --> 03:44:18.818]  That's what I said, Gerd.
[03:44:19.298 --> 03:44:22.562]  I'm making you Secretary of Offense.
[03:44:22.822 --> 03:44:25.565]  Now, prepare for fire and fury!
[03:44:32.768 --> 03:44:33.969]  You like that, Kirk Cousins?
[03:44:34.049 --> 03:44:34.770]  You like that?
[03:44:35.070 --> 03:44:36.291]  Well, there you have it.
[03:44:36.732 --> 03:44:37.672]  Terrific spot.
[03:44:38.633 --> 03:44:42.917]  Funny and satire without being overtly political or nasty.
[03:44:43.558 --> 03:44:45.820]  Congratulations, John D. Domenico.
[03:44:45.900 --> 03:44:51.845]  As someone who's known Donald Trump and studied his speech patterns myself for many years, you nailed it.
[03:44:52.025 --> 03:44:52.906]  You really nailed it.
[03:44:53.386 --> 03:44:55.128]  Thank you very much, Roger.
[03:44:55.148 --> 03:44:57.570]  I'm very excited to be on the show, I have to tell you.
[03:44:59.475 --> 03:45:15.359]  Well, I've been doing Trump since 2004, right around the end of the first season of The Apprentice, when there was a big demand corporately for Trump to come in and roast people and do apprentice games and things like that.
[03:45:15.459 --> 03:45:20.780]  So I've had a really long runway with him and to learn his voice and to really
[03:45:21.620 --> 03:45:24.381]  Get it down, especially these last two and a half years.
[03:45:24.721 --> 03:45:31.663]  Since he's announced, he's become more physical and his speech has become more him.
[03:45:31.683 --> 03:45:35.464]  It seems like he seems like he was very restricted on the apprentice.
[03:45:35.504 --> 03:45:37.205]  Blue team, green team.
[03:45:37.465 --> 03:45:38.405]  He did a good job.
[03:45:38.445 --> 03:45:39.986]  The blue team, you're fired.
[03:45:40.006 --> 03:45:43.887]  It was kind of, he seems so big in a way.
[03:45:44.267 --> 03:45:53.422]  Since I had been doing him for so long, I had done him in so many other platforms, that when he announced, I wanted to make sure that he was 100% in the race.
[03:45:53.843 --> 03:45:56.206]  And I thought to myself, you know, if he can make it to the first
[03:45:56.983 --> 03:46:19.856]  If he can make it to the first debate, I'll be set for the fall, because that's how, you know, they book out months in advance for these corporate things, and as you well know, not only did he make it to the first debate, he crushed it in the first debate, and the second debate, and third debate, and then things just started taking off, and a friend of mine, Tom Shalhoub, who is on, he's still on Fox News, but he was on the show Red Eye,
[03:46:20.716 --> 03:46:21.877]  Um, he brought me on.
[03:46:21.917 --> 03:46:25.380]  I think I did about 50, 60 appearances on Red Eye as Trump.
[03:46:25.620 --> 03:46:28.482]  And then because of that, I did Fox & Friends a number of times.
[03:46:28.542 --> 03:46:40.571]  So it was a great platform and we did some really wonderful comedy and then some other shows picked me up and then voiceovers and the corporate stuff and it's been kind of, it's pretty much taken over my... There's Tom right now!
[03:46:40.891 --> 03:46:42.352]  Tom Shalhoub, a very funny guy.
[03:46:42.432 --> 03:46:47.615]  Well, as you know, the pundits in the mainstream didn't see Trump coming.
[03:46:47.735 --> 03:46:50.196]  So, I can see why it started slowly.
[03:46:50.716 --> 03:46:53.618]  They were the last people in the world who thought that he would win.
[03:46:53.658 --> 03:46:54.058]  What was it?
[03:46:54.098 --> 03:46:55.779]  Jeb Bush said you're not going to elect a president?
[03:46:55.799 --> 03:46:57.580]  You're not going to insult your way into the presidency?
[03:46:58.260 --> 03:46:59.081]  Guess what, Jeb?
[03:46:59.641 --> 03:47:00.201]  Wrong.
[03:47:00.742 --> 03:47:01.202]  Wrong.
[03:47:06.184 --> 03:47:08.806]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.222 --> 03:47:20.824]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:47:21.445 --> 03:47:24.947]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:47:31.151 --> 03:47:31.672]  Welcome back.
[03:47:32.728 --> 03:47:39.312]  You're at the right place, that's right, it's the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your host, Roger Stone, joining me, Matt Bracken.
[03:47:40.893 --> 03:48:02.608]  If you like the expanded coverage at InfoWars, if you're enjoying the Real News with David Knight in the mornings, the iconic Alex Jones Show midday, and of course the War Room with my colleague Owen Schroyer, please remember that we are completely listener and viewer supported here at InfoWars, and we face the greatest challenge we have ever faced.
[03:48:03.569 --> 03:48:18.939]  If you're a regular listener, you know about the spate of lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars, every one of them baseless, every one of them meritless, every one of them bogus, but designed to generate negative headlines and enormous legal bills.
[03:48:19.439 --> 03:48:29.366]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to remove us from the Internet, remove us from YouTube, from Facebook, from Google, and so on.
[03:48:29.986 --> 03:48:33.129]  The costs are astronomical and they're only rising.
[03:48:33.209 --> 03:48:33.469]  Why?
[03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:39.014]  Because Alex Jones is a fighter and he will fight every one of these lawsuits with truth.
[03:48:39.574 --> 03:48:41.356]  Because the truth in the end will win.
[03:48:41.636 --> 03:48:43.517]  But that doesn't mean that it isn't expensive.
[03:48:43.818 --> 03:48:48.482]  So we need you to go to the InfoWars store now and look at some of our terrific products.
[03:48:48.542 --> 03:48:58.150]  Not only do we have our cutting-edge nutraceuticals where Alex Jones and his team of scientists take the very best of ancient Chinese medicine
[03:48:58.670 --> 03:49:06.339]  In practice for centuries, combining it with cutting-edge new nutraceuticals to bring you formulas that are really effective.
[03:49:06.979 --> 03:49:17.151]  And you can compare our prices with the competitor, oh I don't know, say Whole Foods, and you'll find that our prices are lower, but our products are superior.
[03:49:17.611 --> 03:49:21.975]  You'll find no fillers, you'll find no secondary ingredients.
[03:49:22.455 --> 03:49:25.357]  Everything that they put forward has been rigorously tested.
[03:49:25.818 --> 03:49:32.043]  And if you don't believe it, go to the testimonials where you have literally thousands, in some cases, of satisfied customers.
[03:49:32.463 --> 03:49:37.987]  Whether it is Brain Force Plus, whether it is the Red Pill.
[03:49:38.348 --> 03:49:39.969]  These are some of my favorites.
[03:49:40.129 --> 03:49:42.031]  I also like the whey protein.
[03:49:42.471 --> 03:49:45.994]  Finding good whey protein that doesn't taste like gasoline is a challenge.
[03:49:46.474 --> 03:49:49.535]  The one we sell at InfoWars is one of the best.
[03:49:49.955 --> 03:49:53.017]  But please, when you go to the site, you're not only helping yourself.
[03:49:53.837 --> 03:49:57.038]  As Alex Jones liked to say, it's a 360 degree win.
[03:49:57.938 --> 03:50:04.641]  You win, and we win, because Alex Jones pumps the money back into InfoWars to pay for our expanded coverage here.
[03:50:04.941 --> 03:50:06.562]  So please, folks, do us a favor.
[03:50:06.782 --> 03:50:07.762]  Do yourself a favor.
[03:50:08.042 --> 03:50:09.483]  Stand up for the First Amendment.
[03:50:09.903 --> 03:50:12.364]  Kick George Soros right in the derriere.
[03:50:12.924 --> 03:50:16.605]  Go to the website now and order some of these terrific products.
[03:50:17.225 --> 03:50:24.368]  So we were talking about how this woman, Russian lawyer, Vesel Nitskaya, got into the country, Matt.
[03:50:24.408 --> 03:50:31.870]  What's interesting is that the true pundit reported that she had a special visa that was approved by a U.S.
[03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:34.631]  attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara.
[03:50:35.191 --> 03:50:52.165]  But then Reuters came out with a story almost immediately contradicting that, saying that Bahara had denied her a visa, but then going on to say that the State Department gave her a special visa anyway in June of 2016.
[03:50:52.586 --> 03:50:55.728]  What it doesn't tell us is who approved that visa.
[03:50:55.848 --> 03:51:01.173]  She was denied a visa because she was not a witness or central to a legal case
[03:51:01.933 --> 03:51:05.716]  In which she had a client going on in New York.
[03:51:06.176 --> 03:51:13.780]  She had been approved for a temporary visa on three separate previous occasions by the U.S.
[03:51:13.840 --> 03:51:14.221]  Attorney.
[03:51:14.601 --> 03:51:19.424]  The question seems to me to remain, who let this woman in the country?
[03:51:20.044 --> 03:51:26.908]  She clearly came here for the purposes of setting up Donald Trump Jr., who's a great man and a good patriot.
[03:51:27.849 --> 03:51:30.330]  But this question is vexing.
[03:51:30.350 --> 03:51:31.051]  Do you have an opinion?
[03:51:31.997 --> 03:51:35.800]  Yeah, and I'd like to discuss a little bit about that Donald Jr.
[03:51:35.841 --> 03:51:36.141]  meeting.
[03:51:37.022 --> 03:51:41.245]  To me, this all smacks of an active intelligence operation against the president.
[03:51:41.726 --> 03:51:52.836]  And what they'll do is operate on multiple tracks, because you don't know which of the plans is going to, you know, be a fizzle or a hang fire, and which is going to be the one that takes off and succeeds.
[03:51:53.176 --> 03:51:56.179]  So you might try five or six different parallel operations.
[03:51:57.580 --> 03:51:59.121]  One of them was the Donald Jr.
[03:51:59.161 --> 03:51:59.461]  meeting.
[03:51:59.821 --> 03:52:01.982]  It didn't matter if they talked about badminton.
[03:52:02.343 --> 03:52:08.126]  The fact that they were in the same room would be then spun into the false narrative of Russian collusion.
[03:52:08.767 --> 03:52:10.268]  Another one was Carter Page.
[03:52:10.648 --> 03:52:12.009]  He's a good, decent man.
[03:52:12.049 --> 03:52:15.491]  He was in Moscow many times on business.
[03:52:15.711 --> 03:52:16.291]  That's enough.
[03:52:16.311 --> 03:52:20.694]  The fact that he was in Moscow, that can be spun into a false narrative.
[03:52:21.274 --> 03:52:23.496]  And the other one is Papadopoulos.
[03:52:23.676 --> 03:52:25.437]  This is the most flagrant to me.
[03:52:26.218 --> 03:52:30.361]  He happens, of all the people in London, this is what, a city of many millions?
[03:52:30.941 --> 03:52:36.025]  He just happened to sit down at a bar, talk about winning back-to-back Powerballs.
[03:52:36.605 --> 03:52:46.752]  He happens to sit down with the High Commissioner to Britain from Australia, and allegedly talked about Russian espionage, just purely by coincidence.
[03:52:47.292 --> 03:52:48.193]  And then it turns out
[03:52:48.763 --> 03:52:53.904]  That this guy Alexander Downer is a major bundler for the Hillary Clinton Foundation.
[03:52:53.965 --> 03:53:00.106]  We don't know what his angle was in doing so, getting Australians to donate to the Hillary Clinton Foundation.
[03:53:00.806 --> 03:53:03.467]  To the Clinton Foundation, Family Foundation, whatever it's called.
[03:53:04.027 --> 03:53:09.729]  So, this to me smacks of an intelligence operation where he's vectored to Papadopoulos.
[03:53:10.089 --> 03:53:14.790]  Doesn't matter if they spoke to each other for two minutes about football scores.
[03:53:15.691 --> 03:53:16.751]  American or British.
[03:53:17.523 --> 03:53:27.692]  It can then be spun as a meeting where this wonderful guy, Alexander Downer, just happened to hear Papadopoulos talking about Russian collusion.
[03:53:28.273 --> 03:53:34.698]  This, to me, is like if somebody said, hey, my neighbor, he's won 10 lotteries in a row.
[03:53:35.439 --> 03:53:37.841]  I would have to be an idiot to actually believe that.
[03:53:38.261 --> 03:53:42.185]  Now, if I saw the checks, I'd say then the fix is in.
[03:53:42.625 --> 03:53:43.626]  This was all a setup.
[03:53:45.450 --> 03:53:46.811]  The Donald Jr.
[03:53:46.851 --> 03:53:56.577]  meeting, the London meeting with the Australian High Commissioner, who just happens to be all tied to the Clinton Foundation, and then going after Carter Page.
[03:53:57.158 --> 03:54:00.600]  Remember, it wasn't just a bug and wiretapped Carter Page.
[03:54:00.940 --> 03:54:04.042]  He was the conduit into the entire Trump campaign.
[03:54:04.543 --> 03:54:09.146]  Once they had the FISA warrant on Carter Page, all of his contacts were fair game.
[03:54:09.786 --> 03:54:12.768]  And that means going back in time, because it's all archived.
[03:54:13.188 --> 03:54:14.129]  Everything is saved.
[03:54:14.669 --> 03:54:17.830]  So yeah, this to me was an intelligence operation from Go.
[03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:20.990]  They assumed that Hillary would win and it would all be covered up.
[03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:24.611]  You know, that this would be used to sabotage the election.
[03:54:25.191 --> 03:54:29.692]  But then he actually won and now they're desperate to cover their tracks.
[03:54:30.112 --> 03:54:32.292]  Because people can definitely go to jail for this.
[03:54:32.672 --> 03:54:33.413]  Or be killed.
[03:54:33.433 --> 03:54:38.234]  You know, Andrew McCabe, you'd better have a powerful force field around you, my friend.
[03:54:38.594 --> 03:54:40.634]  Because there are people that will take you out.
[03:54:41.485 --> 03:54:46.053]  I mean, I'm talking about people that do wet jobs, do wet work for a living.
[03:54:46.454 --> 03:54:47.736]  They will have you taken out.
[03:54:48.424 --> 03:54:53.167]  Well, of course, Matt, we pray that you're wrong, but you don't seem to believe in coincidence.
[03:54:53.547 --> 03:55:06.674]  Look, if Papadopoulos and Carter Page were so low in the food chain, neither one of them was a paid staffer, neither one of them had a credential to get into the headquarters, neither one of them had any status.
[03:55:06.694 --> 03:55:15.680]  They were both volunteers in what was a foreign policy committee with over a hundred members, essentially put together for the purposes of a press release.
[03:55:16.460 --> 03:55:23.045]  Carter Page may be a perfectly nice guy, but to refer to him as a foreign policy advisor for Donald Trump is a bit of a stretch.
[03:55:23.405 --> 03:55:26.607]  In the case of Papadopoulos, it's even more of a stretch.
[03:55:27.128 --> 03:55:33.132]  So I tend to agree with you that those two operations are highly suspicious.
[03:55:33.272 --> 03:55:35.954]  The meeting in the Donald Trump Jr.'
[03:55:35.934 --> 03:55:44.480]  's office, which is allegedly to get negative information regarding Hillary, she has none, produces none, ends up being a discussion of adoption law.
[03:55:45.320 --> 03:55:45.921]  It's a setup.
[03:55:46.281 --> 03:55:47.883]  Very clearly a setup.
[03:55:48.844 --> 03:55:50.365]  And there is no crime there.
[03:55:50.405 --> 03:55:51.866]  There's no wrongdoing there.
[03:55:51.906 --> 03:55:52.447]  Don Jr.
[03:55:52.487 --> 03:55:53.988]  didn't do anything wrong.
[03:55:54.929 --> 03:56:01.555]  We don't know anything about this woman lawyer other than the fact that she's connected to Fusion GPS.
[03:56:02.136 --> 03:56:06.119]  How incredibly coincidental that she's worked with them.
[03:56:06.620 --> 03:56:07.300]  Extraordinary.
[03:56:07.400 --> 03:56:10.463]  And now they're talking about Brennan's secret trip to Moscow in 2016.
[03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:15.343]  You know, the guy that voted for the communists in 1980 as an adult.
[03:56:15.923 --> 03:56:17.344]  And then went to the CIA.
[03:56:17.564 --> 03:56:23.589]  Also the guy who spied on a Senate committee looking into torture by the CIA and then lied about it under oath.
[03:56:23.989 --> 03:56:26.250]  An Islamic convert, John Brennan.
[03:56:26.591 --> 03:56:30.313]  I think you will find, I have a long piece at Infowars you can pull up.
[03:56:30.714 --> 03:56:31.935]  I think he's the chief perp.
[03:56:32.775 --> 03:56:38.179]  He's the guy who starts suggesting Russian collusion long before it's a popular term.
[03:56:38.219 --> 03:56:42.302]  In fact, he's predicted it seemingly before it's ever allegedly happened.
[03:56:42.742 --> 03:56:46.105]  So, I want to thank Matt Bracken for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:46.525 --> 03:56:54.611]  I want to thank all of you for tuning in and I want to ask you one more time to remember that we face the greatest challenge we have ever faced at InfoWars.
[03:56:55.171 --> 03:56:57.131]  There is an effort to strangle us.
[03:56:57.192 --> 03:57:03.913]  There is an effort to kill our First Amendment rights, to wipe us off the internet, and literally shut us down.
[03:57:04.073 --> 03:57:08.254]  Alex Jones is working double time to prevent that, but we need your help.
[03:57:08.354 --> 03:57:20.997]  So please, go to TheInfoWars.com store now, check these extraordinary specials, particularly like the Super Blue Oral line of products, now on special, the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the gargle,
[03:57:21.397 --> 03:57:23.361]  My wife is a big aficionado of these.
[03:57:23.421 --> 03:57:25.765]  It's the best whitening agent she has found.
[03:57:25.865 --> 03:57:30.293]  But find a product that works for you or look at our books or t-shirts.
[03:57:30.693 --> 03:57:32.056]  We need your help.
[03:57:32.136 --> 03:57:34.200]  God bless you and God bless America.
[03:57:57.054 --> 03:58:05.821]  Infowars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[03:58:06.221 --> 03:58:13.606]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:58:13.907 --> 03:58:16.048]  No longer 5%, but now 10% at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:58:27.619 --> 03:58:29.700]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[03:58:30.180 --> 03:58:38.344]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.
[03:58:38.704 --> 03:58:41.245]  We need your emergency contribution today.
[03:58:41.665 --> 03:58:45.187]  Go to the InfoWars store and click on the donate button.
[03:58:45.507 --> 03:58:46.588]  We need your help.
[03:58:52.088 --> 03:58:58.915]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of brain force for a sustainable burst of energy.
