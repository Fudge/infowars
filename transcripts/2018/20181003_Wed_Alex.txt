[00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:08.419]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:14.641]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:20.642]  36 years ago, this happened.
[00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:23.403]  I had one beer.
[00:00:23.403 --> 00:00:24.243]  Right?
[00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:25.183]  I had one beer.
[00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:34.813]  Well, do you think it was?
[00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:35.274]  Nope!
[00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:36.254]  It was one beer.
[00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:37.054]  Oh good.
[00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:37.975]  How did you get home?
[00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:38.755]  I don't remember.
[00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:39.415]  How'd you get there?
[00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:40.195]  I don't remember.
[00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:40.976]  Where is the place?
[00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:41.956]  I don't remember.
[00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:43.117]  How many years ago was it?
[00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:43.577]  I don't know.
[00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.958]  I don't know.
[00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.359]  I don't know!
[00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.620]  I don't know!
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.020]  What neighborhood was it in?
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.460]  I don't know.
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.101]  Where's the house?
[00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:56.121]  I don't know.
[00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:56.702]  Upstairs?
[00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:57.402]  Downstairs?
[00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:58.042]  Where was it?
[00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:58.382]  I don't know.
[00:00:58.382 --> 00:00:59.363]  But I had one beer!
[00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:00.323]  That's the only thing I remember.
[00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.311]  And a man's life is in tatters.
[00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.292]  A man's life is shattered.
[00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:10.633]  His wife is shattered.
[00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:16.215]  His daughters, who are beautiful, incredible young kids.
[00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:17.356]  They destroy people.
[00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:19.097]  They want to destroy people.
[00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:21.118]  These are really evil people.
[00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:59.116]  You know, for ten years, I don't know him, I never met him, but I've been hearing there's this guy named Brett Kavanaugh, who is like a perfect person who's destined for the Supreme Court.
[00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:00.977]  I've heard that for a long time.
[00:02:00.977 --> 00:02:04.341]  And a lot of smart people.
[00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:06.142]  And first in his class at Yale.
[00:02:06.983 --> 00:02:11.327]  Top top in his class at Yale Law School.
[00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:14.690]  He's led like a life that's unbelievable.
[00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.271]  He's had no problems.
[00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:17.012]  They've never taken.
[00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.578]  It's Wednesday, October 3rd, 2018.
[00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:32.579]  Just 34 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.400]  The globalists, not just here, but across the world, are hanging on to power by their fingernails.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:49.682]  And in many other areas, they are being ripped free by the tide of liberty and the tide of human awakening, and sucked into the black hole of the past and history.
[00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:53.763]  The ashes that they came from, they will become again.
[00:02:54.543 --> 00:02:58.825]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen, as we broadcast worldwide.
[00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:08.888]  This is the most hated, most demonized, most lied about broadcast in the world, vaunted for our action against the globalists.
[00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:13.049]  Thanks to you, the listeners, the activists, the heart and soul of this transmission.
[00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.690]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.771]  I'm going to have open phones yet again today.
[00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:19.712]  We have some special guests as well.
[00:03:19.712 --> 00:03:23.573]  But I got to tell you, Christina Blasey Ford's story
[00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:34.064]  Is the most ridiculous, deceptive, flimsy fiasco that I have ever seen.
[00:03:34.064 --> 00:03:36.345]  What a spectacle and all the polls show it.
[00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:38.386]  We'll be going over those polls.
[00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:46.310]  It shows even with skewed polls where they sample 10, 15, 20 percent more Democrats in these polls and they target Democrat voters.
[00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:52.998]  We're seeing 5-10 point boost in battleground states just the last two weeks.
[00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:53.418]  Why?
[00:03:53.418 --> 00:03:57.261]  Because people hate witch hunts.
[00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:00.903]  And they know past behavior is the most indicative of future behavior.
[00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:07.466]  And there would be other reports over 36 years of Kavanaugh doing bad things.
[00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:16.572]  They don't just suddenly pop up days before he's supposed to get confirmed and you got the Democrats sitting on the eggs, sitting on these eggs they've laid.
[00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:19.750]  And then launching them at the last minute.
[00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.953]  So, it's all unraveling.
[00:04:21.953 --> 00:04:32.989]  And of course, one big giant Fox News breaking it, world exclusive, that Soros-funded activists are running up and down the halls, claiming to be victims.
[00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:35.712]  It's even bigger.
[00:04:35.712 --> 00:04:36.552]  Next week's news today.
[00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:38.214]  We told you that last week.
[00:04:38.214 --> 00:04:42.597]  Now we have her boyfriend and others coming out saying she flies all over the place.
[00:04:42.597 --> 00:04:43.777]  She's into polygraphs.
[00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:46.499]  She's an expert psy-opper on how to get around them.
[00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:51.663]  Well, of course, as a mind-control scientist, what do you think she trains the CIA for?
[00:04:51.663 --> 00:04:54.645]  She's an expert at cheating polygraphs.
[00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:56.386]  And who gave her the polygraph?
[00:04:56.386 --> 00:04:58.368]  Was it Mr. Strzok from the FBI?
[00:05:00.413 --> 00:05:04.314]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:14.355]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.336]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:19.777]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:22.418]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:05:22.418 --> 00:05:24.699]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:31.642]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:05:32.202 --> 00:05:41.987]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:43.168]  We'll win.
[00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:46.069]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:53.233]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:56.915]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[00:05:56.915 --> 00:05:58.156]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:05:58.156 --> 00:05:59.157]  We need your support.
[00:05:59.157 --> 00:05:59.897]  I'm counting on you.
[00:06:03.107 --> 00:06:05.730]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:20.102]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:20.102 --> 00:06:24.286]  We've got Republican senators being death-threatened.
[00:06:24.286 --> 00:06:27.049]  The restaurants where they eat are being threatened with death.
[00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:35.455]  We don't have people coming up and asking serious questions like I did of Marco Rubio, saying, hey, fight censorship here in America.
[00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:40.459]  The media said that I assaulted him when I was pretty polite until he got in my face.
[00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:41.620]  That's not what you see from the Democrats.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:50.047]  They are running up and down the halls, yelling, screaming, calling Mitch McConnell a rapist in the airport.
[00:06:50.047 --> 00:06:51.728]  And people see this hysterical,
[00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:58.933]  Witch hunt behavior and major polls we're going to be getting to in the shower in key battleground states.
[00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:17.171]  Like Michigan, like Colorado and other areas show 5 to 10 to 12 to 15 point swings even in Democrat pollster companies where they're already adding a larger sample of Democrats on average about 15%.
[00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:25.155]  That means Trump is probably really at a 65 right now of eligible voters that are polled.
[00:07:25.155 --> 00:07:27.897]  That is unprecedented.
[00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:30.818]  Going into a midterm election.
[00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:38.024]  That's why the Democrats are panicked, like they were with Hillary, saying 98% chance she wins.
[00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:41.927]  Secret New York Times algorithm.
[00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:43.568]  Total garbage.
[00:07:43.568 --> 00:07:46.411]  And so they smell defeat.
[00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:56.980]  But let me tell you, 34 days out, you've got Ryerson, the deadly neurotoxin, sent to Ted Cruz's Houston offices.
[00:07:58.308 --> 00:08:05.970]  You've had attempts to send it to the White House, and attempts to send it to the Pentagon.
[00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:19.053]  And remember, there's a big article on Infowars.com by Steve Watson, we named the anti-fragrance professors that pledged, you're not safe, we're gonna get you, we're gonna get your family.
[00:08:19.053 --> 00:08:23.114]  We know where you live.
[00:08:23.114 --> 00:08:25.835]  So they are the ones creating this atmosphere.
[00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:31.411]  That's how crazy it is 34 days in.
[00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:51.740]  And the major Antifa groups are pledging, led by university professors and others across the country, and law enforcement in blue cities, that's come out in the Soros documents, to stage violent uprisings if Kavanaugh is confirmed and or particularly, the big red line is, if the Republicans hold onto the House and Senate.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.321]  And currently, I believe they're going to have major gains.
[00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:56.002]  You heard that here.
[00:08:57.077 --> 00:09:03.320]  Unless, unless we just let them engage in total election fraud.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.221]  And remember what the states reported.
[00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:11.285]  Hillary stole at least five states and she tried to steal six others.
[00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:17.928]  And they reported Obama's Homeland Security had computers, as they could see the IP addresses, breaking into the state computers.
[00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:21.170]  But at the state level and the county level, people were able to block it.
[00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:35.038]  So it is critical to not have the machines in your area plugged into the internet and to reboot them and wipe them the day of the election because you know Soros owns about half the machines in the country.
[00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:43.782]  Now remember, last month when this all first broke, we reported that
[00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:51.324]  Christine Blasey Ford, that the main protesters directly work for George Soros.
[00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:54.485]  Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:57.205]  Now, weeks later, it's mainstream news.
[00:09:57.205 --> 00:10:01.347]  Folks, I don't just say George Soros is behind this or George Soros is behind that.
[00:10:01.347 --> 00:10:05.448]  He's literally behind everything bad every time I look.
[00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:08.997]  Sexualization of kids, he's behind it.
[00:10:08.997 --> 00:10:09.998]  Open borders, he's behind it.
[00:10:09.998 --> 00:10:12.239]  Bring in radical Islam, he's behind it.
[00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:17.562]  Pushing weaponized marijuana so strong it puts you into a brain-dead coma, he's behind it.
[00:10:17.562 --> 00:10:21.345]  And I'm not for drug war, police state.
[00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:24.607]  I also want you to know that the weaponized marijuana has ruined a lot of lives.
[00:10:24.607 --> 00:10:35.113]  So the point is, whatever it is, evil, bankrupting countries, overthrowing nations, sexualizing children, the whole revolution to confuse the sex of children, Soros is a master villain.
[00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:42.566]  And now it's all over the news, Fox exclusive, the protesters all work for Soros.
[00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:46.228]  Of course they do!
[00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:48.649]  So we're going to get into that.
[00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:51.930]  But here's the big news, and I'm going to cover this when we start the next segment.
[00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.492]  So I have plenty of time.
[00:10:54.492 --> 00:11:06.037]  We have witnesses to Ford, not just her boyfriend, but others that have come forward that aren't getting any attention.
[00:11:08.047 --> 00:11:09.568]  Saying she loved to fly.
[00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.930]  She is a globetrotter.
[00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.511]  There isn't a second door on her house.
[00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:16.654]  It's insane.
[00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:17.774]  There's a duplex next door.
[00:11:17.774 --> 00:11:20.897]  It's a duplex.
[00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:23.559]  But it gets worse.
[00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:28.622]  That she trained people how to pass polygraphs.
[00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:36.809]  What do you think Stanford psychologists, doctors that work in CIA-funded DARPA programs
[00:11:38.439 --> 00:11:42.320]  In false memories and implanting memories.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.841]  That's what she's an expert on.
[00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:46.461]  Her published papers!
[00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:51.722]  That's science fiction stuff!
[00:11:51.722 --> 00:12:00.344]  Oh, but then her grandfather, father, brother, brother-in-law, all work high-level CIA.
[00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:06.446]  In international banking, and wait for it, funding covert operations,
[00:12:07.688 --> 00:12:10.810]  Destabilizing foreign nations, using dirty tricks.
[00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.671]  We're looking into all of them, and it gets better.
[00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:14.972]  Guess what else?
[00:12:14.972 --> 00:12:19.455]  Their specialty is the Russia dossier.
[00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:24.158]  That's right.
[00:12:24.158 --> 00:12:31.282]  It's like saying, was Al Capone in the Italian mafia?
[00:12:31.282 --> 00:12:34.684]  Or is the last name Capone Italian?
[00:12:34.684 --> 00:12:36.245]  Or is Alex Jones wearing a gray shirt?
[00:12:38.763 --> 00:12:40.004]  You're watching on TV?
[00:12:40.004 --> 00:12:42.265]  Yes, and a dark brown sports jacket.
[00:12:42.265 --> 00:12:45.948]  Does that say InfoWars.com behind me?
[00:12:45.948 --> 00:12:48.650]  This is 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.711]  In fact, it's beyond that.
[00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.791]  It's holding up a flash card to a three-year-old saying, what's this number?
[00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:56.511]  And they go, it's a 2.
[00:12:56.511 --> 00:12:58.092]  It's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:12:58.092 --> 00:13:09.874]  It's, this woman is a thoroughbred, deep state, Hillary-worshiping, psych-warfare, leftist, cultural saboteur.
[00:13:09.874 --> 00:13:16.336]  I mean, what is her stock in trade?
[00:13:17.748 --> 00:13:19.810]  Have you asked the question, you know, is she a globalist?
[00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:20.730]  Is she an operative?
[00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.153]  Do bears live in the woods?
[00:13:25.153 --> 00:13:29.016]  Do bears sleep in the woods?
[00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:31.198]  Do bears crap in the woods?
[00:13:31.198 --> 00:13:31.578]  I don't know.
[00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:36.782]  Let's put the video back up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:37.803]  You know the answer to that.
[00:13:37.803 --> 00:13:41.405]  This is ridiculous.
[00:13:41.405 --> 00:13:42.266]  So when we come back,
[00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:49.664]  There's witnesses that nobody's talking about, not just her boyfriend, on record for many years.
[00:13:49.664 --> 00:14:08.930]  And then you've got the boyfriend of the other woman, and restraining orders, and death-threatening families, and just a bunch of whack job, crazy women professors, just like the other woman, senior professor at Georgetown, saying she wants to kill Kavanaugh, kill all the members of Congress that vote for him, and chop their balls off.
[00:14:11.408 --> 00:14:12.008]  That's right!
[00:14:12.008 --> 00:14:12.809]  Castrate them!
[00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:14.129]  I mean, it's a family show!
[00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:17.071]  They're the ones saying this, and she won't get in any trouble.
[00:14:17.071 --> 00:14:29.997]  Because these people are wound up into a crazed, foam-at-the-mouth system.
[00:14:29.997 --> 00:14:31.597]  So that's all coming up after the break.
[00:14:31.597 --> 00:14:33.558]  Now, let me just stop right there.
[00:14:33.558 --> 00:14:35.899]  This is the last day.
[00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:38.941]  Maybe another day, because I've got to come up with new specials to get
[00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:50.542]  Our best-selling nootropic for the brain, that in a healthy, good way, gives you incredible energy, clarity, focus.
[00:14:50.542 --> 00:14:51.444]  Everybody loves it.
[00:14:51.444 --> 00:14:52.686]  It overall is the best seller.
[00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:55.905]  Right up there with X2 and things.
[00:14:55.905 --> 00:15:09.809]  X2 is the most profitable to fund us because it costs more, but Brainforce is overall the number one seller for the number of bottles, but the price is already so low at regular retail compared to leading competitors that are similar formulas.
[00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:14.030]  We just remade the top formulas that are out there, made it even stronger for half the price.
[00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.651]  But at $22 right now, 50% off, you cannot beat that deal.
[00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:23.012]  And I've got to end this deal because if not, we will sell out by the middle of December
[00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:24.601]  That's
[00:15:47.106 --> 00:15:47.967]  I think so.

[00:17:30.489 --> 00:17:35.871]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.

[00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:10.379]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:15.080]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.082]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:19:20.322 --> 00:19:40.485]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.021]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.357 --> 00:20:20.227]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[00:20:20.227 --> 00:20:21.470]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:25.926 --> 00:20:46.513]  So, we know something about the crazed Democrats, the chi-coms that fund them, the anti-American Hollywood scum, whose religion is that they own and run America.
[00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:52.055]  And they would run the country into the ground and destroy it, so that they could feel like they were better than it.
[00:20:53.055 --> 00:20:59.661]  So it is a real issue of people that are projecting their hatred of themselves onto us.
[00:20:59.661 --> 00:21:02.864]  That's why the globalists are such trash.
[00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:14.414]  Now the hunchback demons up there in Congress, like Cory Booker, and I'm saying he's spiritually hunchback, and Dianne Feinstein and others, have lied the whole time, moved the Gold Post down the road,
[00:21:15.054 --> 00:21:26.040]  And then every time one woman gets discredited, and every witness says, there was never a party, we were never there, they never have any witnesses, but they remember every other little detail.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.162]  Except what year it was, and what neighborhood it was, and what house.
[00:21:30.865 --> 00:21:32.646]  They won't move on to a new allegation.
[00:21:32.646 --> 00:21:50.218]  I have seen three different news reports since last week of different letters or phone calls where someone sends a letter, no name, no return address, saying, I saw Kavanaugh rape my daughter in the back of a car 35 years ago.
[00:21:50.218 --> 00:21:52.020]  And then it's all over the news.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.902]  Well, I saw the Loch Ness Monster in my toilet this morning.
[00:21:54.902 --> 00:21:57.924]  Don't have any proof of it.
[00:21:57.924 --> 00:21:58.084]  So,
[00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:06.799]  They just move on to the next fraud and now they're just saying whether he's guilty or not, Cory Booker says, we just need to not confirm him.
[00:22:07.748 --> 00:22:10.010]  It's called authoritarianism.
[00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:20.859]  The good news is, their bullying and their intimidation is radicalizing even the blue-blood Republicans to understand what a clear and present danger the criminal Democrat Party is allied with the Chi-Coms.
[00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:24.482]  And now they're election meddling through Hollywood and the Chi-Com funding.
[00:22:24.482 --> 00:22:29.626]  Now the Chi-Coms are running full-page ads in magazines and newspapers all over this country.
[00:22:32.105 --> 00:22:35.187]  Let's get in to the bombshell proof.
[00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:50.456]  First off, tomorrow's news today, here is a Paul Joseph Watson, September 6th, that's almost a month ago, 2018, man caught paying off Kavanaugh protest, works for Soros-funded organization, and is a lawyer.
[00:22:50.456 --> 00:22:51.117]  We name him...
[00:22:52.117 --> 00:22:58.419]  And we name the other Soros operatives who were then drug out by the police.
[00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:02.600]  Look at Fox News, the big exclusive.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.862]  Anti-Kavanaugh protesters accosting senators have ties to Soros.
[00:23:08.862 --> 00:23:09.342]  Really?
[00:23:09.342 --> 00:23:10.162]  You think so?
[00:23:10.162 --> 00:23:12.083]  He only spends billions a year trying to overthrow this country.
[00:23:13.274 --> 00:23:16.035]  Now, let's move on to the other witnesses.
[00:23:16.035 --> 00:23:19.957]  We don't just have all five of her original witnesses saying it never happened.
[00:23:19.957 --> 00:23:26.499]  And her saying about one of her old friends that said it never happened, oh, she's been sick and dealing with some problems.
[00:23:26.499 --> 00:23:30.241]  And she sent me a letter saying, sorry, talk to my lawyer.
[00:23:30.241 --> 00:23:38.544]  But she said in a statement, under penalty of perjury, felony perjury, that it never happened and she doesn't remember any of it.
[00:23:38.544 --> 00:23:38.944]  Period.
[00:23:40.953 --> 00:23:42.354]  That clip's coming up next segment.
[00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:45.497]  This is going to take this segment the next to go through this.
[00:23:45.497 --> 00:23:48.699]  So, the story is up on Infowars.com.
[00:23:48.699 --> 00:23:51.061]  It's the best boil-down for information liberation.
[00:23:51.061 --> 00:23:52.122]  Bombshell!
[00:23:52.122 --> 00:23:58.988]  Ford's ex-boyfriend says she had no fear of flying or living in enclosed spaces.
[00:23:58.988 --> 00:24:01.349]  Helped friend prep for polygraph.
[00:24:01.349 --> 00:24:08.455]  But when we come back, we have the specific video of her looking down and going, I know nothing about polygraphs.
[00:24:08.455 --> 00:24:09.976]  It's like handing me a Remington
[00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:16.050]  700-308, and I can shoot bullseye at a thousand yards, and I get the gun, first time I shoot bullseye.
[00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.693]  I know nothing about Remington 700s.
[00:24:18.693 --> 00:24:24.458]  I know nothing about it.
[00:24:24.458 --> 00:24:29.423]  The woman is a psych warfare operative, working in huge DARPA mind control programs.
[00:24:29.423 --> 00:24:30.084]  That's what it is.
[00:24:30.084 --> 00:24:35.229]  Implanting false memories, removing memories, creating false realities, close quote.
[00:24:36.704 --> 00:24:41.945]  What do you think they train operatives to do at the psychology facilities at Stanford?
[00:24:41.945 --> 00:24:43.986]  They train them to beat polygraphs.
[00:24:43.986 --> 00:24:46.666]  One of the first things you get taught to do.
[00:24:46.666 --> 00:24:49.107]  You can read it in the declassified documents.
[00:24:49.107 --> 00:24:50.347]  But there you go!
[00:24:50.347 --> 00:24:52.868]  This lady's connected to the Defense Language School.
[00:24:52.868 --> 00:24:54.708]  Who do you think they're training there?
[00:24:54.708 --> 00:24:57.589]  We got folks in this building that were trained at the Defense Language School.
[00:24:57.589 --> 00:25:00.570]  That's where spooks go to get trained.
[00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.110]  Not Easter bunnies.
[00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.491]  Not little cutesy baby talking women.
[00:25:05.491 --> 00:25:06.011]  Let's continue.
[00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:08.238]  Bombshell!
[00:25:08.238 --> 00:25:10.820]  And then it goes through all the evidence.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.541]  The next segment I'm going to read through all of this.
[00:25:13.541 --> 00:25:20.004]  But let's get to the witnesses that no one's talking about and no one's giving any attention.
[00:25:20.004 --> 00:25:22.125]  Infowars.com.
[00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:24.506]  Travel photos.
[00:25:24.506 --> 00:25:29.649]  Ex-boyfriend sworn statement seals Ford's fate as a liar.
[00:25:29.649 --> 00:25:30.469]  That's right.
[00:25:30.469 --> 00:25:35.832]  She traveled to New Zealand over and over again and thought about relocating there.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.322]  There's a globalist for taking that over.
[00:25:41.322 --> 00:25:42.503]  She went to Hawaii.
[00:25:42.503 --> 00:25:47.285]  She went to all these places recently.
[00:25:47.285 --> 00:25:49.987]  But now she has fears of wide open places.
[00:25:49.987 --> 00:25:53.629]  That's why she kayaks in the middle of big lakes.
[00:25:53.629 --> 00:25:55.810]  That's why she paddleboards.
[00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.411]  It's why she travels.
[00:25:57.411 --> 00:25:59.372]  Let me pull this article up and show it to you viewers.
[00:25:59.372 --> 00:26:01.213]  All the way from the United States to New Zealand.
[00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:08.633]  All of this coming out.
[00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:09.074]  All of this.
[00:26:09.074 --> 00:26:13.848]  Ex-boyfriend of Christine Ford says she wasn't afraid of flying or closed spaces.
[00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.010]  And it just goes from there.
[00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.532]  So, who are the other witnesses?
[00:26:20.532 --> 00:26:21.272]  It's her.
[00:26:21.272 --> 00:26:22.232]  It's her record.
[00:26:22.232 --> 00:26:23.013]  It's her history.
[00:26:23.013 --> 00:26:26.914]  They tried to expunge her social media.
[00:26:26.914 --> 00:26:28.855]  They tried to expunge her Stanford record.
[00:26:28.855 --> 00:26:31.977]  They tried to expunge the reviews, but we were able to save a lot of them.
[00:26:31.977 --> 00:26:36.719]  And it turns out, she never once talked about fear of open spaces or fear of travel.
[00:26:36.719 --> 00:26:38.760]  In fact, she traveled the world!
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:48.362]  But it turns out, she said, and it's all in these articles, that New Zealand wasn't far enough away, trying to reinvent herself.
[00:26:48.362 --> 00:26:59.164]  But I'd say she's reinvented herself now, as an RU486 operative, writing papers for it, trying to stop Kavanaugh, who might be against it.
[00:26:59.164 --> 00:27:05.765]  And she's done quite a job at Stanford and other universities, working in programs that deal with implanted memories.
[00:27:06.616 --> 00:27:13.440]  But let me tell you, there's not many places you can fly further than to New Zealand.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.461]  What is that, a 18-hour flight?
[00:27:15.461 --> 00:27:21.784]  I mean, I guess Bangkok maybe is a little bit further from California?
[00:27:21.784 --> 00:27:23.925]  Maybe the middle of Russia?
[00:27:23.925 --> 00:27:24.446]  I don't know.
[00:27:24.446 --> 00:27:27.888]  The point is, it's about as far away, maybe Antarctica.
[00:27:27.888 --> 00:27:29.769]  Maybe the bottom of the planet.
[00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:34.671]  That's 4,000 or 5,000 miles further for Cupcake.
[00:27:34.671 --> 00:27:35.892]  Maybe the tip of Chile.
[00:27:37.096 --> 00:27:39.023]  Maybe the Horn of Africa.
[00:27:39.023 --> 00:27:39.385]  I don't know.
[00:27:39.385 --> 00:27:40.349]  Maybe Easter Island.
[00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:46.249]  So, oh, it's only 12 hours, 50 minutes, so I guess it's close.
[00:27:46.249 --> 00:27:48.170]  Well, that shows no fear of flying.
[00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:53.911]  Remember, she couldn't fly that last week because they had to dig up some more professors.
[00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:55.512]  And it's all professors.
[00:27:55.512 --> 00:28:00.153]  Oh, a professor that Kavanaugh, no evidence shows, ever knew, who went to Yale with him.
[00:28:00.153 --> 00:28:06.395]  Some other professor says he saw a guy get in his face and Kavanaugh threw ice on him and the guy got arrested.
[00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:08.036]  Who the hell knows if that's even true?
[00:28:09.494 --> 00:28:18.722]  Oh, and then these other women, their boyfriends and fiancés and people gone public, and said that they had to call the police on one of these other women.
[00:28:20.708 --> 00:28:31.793]  But I know this, I've had them in the media and law firms involved in it from the Democrats, make up stories about me and you look at it and you go, why did they say such weird stories that make no sense?
[00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:37.896]  Because they think if it's some really weird thing that, oh, it must be true because you wouldn't make something up like that.
[00:28:37.896 --> 00:28:45.239]  Like I'm hopping around the office in swastika shoes and, you know, saying anti-Semitic things and all this other made up crap.
[00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:53.628]  They just make it up, and then they stick it in their filthy newspapers, and they destroy good people's lives!
[00:28:53.628 --> 00:28:55.110]  These people don't have consciences!
[00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:02.286]  Ever wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[00:29:02.286 --> 00:29:07.170]  Vercell Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.

[00:30:19.524 --> 00:30:22.566]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[00:30:22.566 --> 00:30:25.007]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.

[00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:46.500]  About winter sun, vitamin D3.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.442]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[00:30:52.442 --> 00:30:54.583]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:30:54.583 --> 00:31:00.144]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:00.144 --> 00:31:10.588]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.728 --> 00:31:12.791]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:15.676]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:31:15.676 --> 00:31:17.158]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.158 --> 00:31:23.989]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:31:23.989 --> 00:31:25.251]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:31:26.052 --> 00:31:35.754]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:31:35.754 --> 00:31:52.578]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:55.719]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:31:55.899 --> 00:32:00.042]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:00.042 --> 00:32:04.005]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:07.287]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.287 --> 00:32:13.572]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.572 --> 00:32:16.334]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:17.074 --> 00:32:20.896]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:20.896 --> 00:32:27.361]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.361 --> 00:32:32.324]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.072 --> 00:32:36.995]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:36.995 --> 00:32:44.199]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.199 --> 00:32:48.902]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:48.902 --> 00:32:55.106]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:59.089]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:18.486]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.486 --> 00:33:23.889]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[00:33:23.889 --> 00:33:26.050]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:30.592]  Friend as in any wonder lightning strikes me.
[00:33:35.396 --> 00:34:02.695]  I tell you, when I started talking about Jesus more on air, now this is a spiritual fight, and when I crossed the Rubicon, I don't know, about six, seven years ago, and really wasn't tempted by evil anymore, by real evil, that's when the world really started coming after me.
[00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:07.333]  That's when the doors of the universe began to open up as well.
[00:34:07.333 --> 00:34:10.015]  My relationship with God got even stronger.
[00:34:10.015 --> 00:34:14.078]  It's amazing, but that's good old Keith Whitley.
[00:34:14.078 --> 00:34:17.920]  That's one of the few guys to give George Strait a run for his money.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:23.204]  And he died young.
[00:34:23.204 --> 00:34:24.204]  That's a really good song.
[00:34:24.204 --> 00:34:30.168]  You know, I fought with the devil, got down on his level.
[00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:32.410]  But I never gave in, so he gave up on me.
[00:34:33.717 --> 00:34:34.738]  That's what you want, folks.
[00:34:34.738 --> 00:34:37.540]  You want the devil to give up on you.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.760]  And then you start trying to destroy it.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.943]  Because that's when you get close to God.
[00:34:41.943 --> 00:34:44.705]  That's when God starts to move in to your life.
[00:34:44.705 --> 00:34:46.966]  When you really start seeing God.
[00:34:46.966 --> 00:34:50.629]  Now let's get back to the evil we're fighting.
[00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:52.110]  And believe me, it's pure evil as you know.
[00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:56.913]  And it's going to manifest itself and become that much more obvious, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:04.463 --> 00:35:08.484]  Ford is a disgusting creation of the deep state.
[00:35:08.484 --> 00:35:13.565]  Her entire male family are spooks.
[00:35:13.565 --> 00:35:20.407]  And they're not like Army or Marine Corps soldiers or officers assigned to real operations.
[00:35:20.407 --> 00:35:23.247]  They're the ones that run our lives.
[00:35:23.247 --> 00:35:25.828]  They're the ones that control the schools.
[00:35:25.828 --> 00:35:29.489]  They're the ones that push Hollywood to inject the poison into our culture.
[00:35:30.316 --> 00:35:32.277]  They're the abortion pushers.
[00:35:32.277 --> 00:35:35.160]  They're the break up the family peddlers.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.883]  They're the transgender promoters.
[00:35:39.883 --> 00:35:40.464]  They're the plague.
[00:35:41.633 --> 00:35:44.315]  They're solid death.
[00:35:44.315 --> 00:35:56.822]  You know, I remember reading the John Birch Society, stuff they wrote 50 years ago about globalist world government operatives inside of the intelligence agencies.
[00:35:56.822 --> 00:36:01.185]  Now they were putting on ugly art and ugly literature and ugly architecture.
[00:36:01.185 --> 00:36:02.565]  Now they wanted to destroy the family.
[00:36:02.565 --> 00:36:08.389]  Now they wanted to merge us with China.
[00:36:08.389 --> 00:36:09.990]  Now our government put Mao Zedong in.
[00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:19.204]  All of it turned out to be absolutely dead on, spot on.
[00:36:19.204 --> 00:36:21.286]  People ask how I'm so dead on.
[00:36:21.286 --> 00:36:34.676]  Well, I had the right foundation because the John Burr Society was founded by patriots in our government that were aware of what was going on and were battling what we know as the globalists today.
[00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:37.986]  And people like Barry Goldwater came out of the whole awakening.
[00:36:37.986 --> 00:36:42.569]  Ronald Reagan was fully aware of the Birch Society and informed on that.
[00:36:42.569 --> 00:36:44.991]  And I'm not a member of the John Birch Society.
[00:36:44.991 --> 00:36:50.856]  You know, my dad gave anti-communist speeches and even hosted a radio show when he was in high school in Dallas.
[00:36:50.856 --> 00:36:53.538]  He'd drive up Friday afternoons and tape it.
[00:36:53.538 --> 00:36:55.459]  It was on WBAP.
[00:36:55.459 --> 00:37:01.183]  But this is what we're dealing with, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:01.183 --> 00:37:02.064]  And it's the real deal.
[00:37:04.187 --> 00:37:20.690]  And folks need to just get their heads screwed on straight and realize that we're facing a world government corporate system that wants a final revolution, even over the biology between men and women, and to have a total monopoly over reproduction.
[00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:27.292]  Why do you think Colbert, of the hundreds of times he's attacked me, always makes jokes about Jones claims they're putting stuff in the water?
[00:37:27.292 --> 00:37:30.433]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:37:30.433 --> 00:37:32.453]  Because that's their prime operation.
[00:37:33.578 --> 00:37:38.122]  Now you understand that 99% of people in government aren't involved in this.
[00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:50.152]  You understand the President's trying to stop all this and trying to release all the suppressed technologies in energy and in health and in other areas of science and they're blocking him!
[00:37:50.152 --> 00:37:58.979]  He can't even get three levels down to do what he says.
[00:37:58.979 --> 00:38:01.621]  But they made a mistake.
[00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:02.562]  They made a big mistake.
[00:38:05.407 --> 00:38:14.791]  They transferred dictatorial powers to the presidency under Clinton, Bush, and Obama.
[00:38:14.791 --> 00:38:19.712]  And Trump is annihilating them with it right now.
[00:38:19.712 --> 00:38:26.855]  So he can kill their deals and have it revert back to what it was, and just him sticking his foot in the door.
[00:38:26.855 --> 00:38:29.936]  This is the best analogy I've come up with in a long time.
[00:38:29.936 --> 00:38:33.478]  The globalists were closing that big old giant vault door to seal us in.
[00:38:34.713 --> 00:38:36.835]  Our tombs.
[00:38:36.835 --> 00:38:42.539]  And laughing at us the whole time while they did it.
[00:38:42.539 --> 00:38:44.700]  The archetype of supervillains bragging is really true.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:49.064]  I used to always watch movies and cartoons when I was a kid with the supervillains bragging.
[00:38:49.064 --> 00:38:52.046]  And they're like, I wouldn't brag if I was a supervillain.
[00:38:52.046 --> 00:38:54.327]  But that's in the criminal psychology.
[00:38:54.327 --> 00:38:57.490]  The globalists write books and brag and tell you what they're going to do.
[00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.232]  Like you're too stupid to even read it or too stupid to stop them.
[00:39:00.232 --> 00:39:01.853]  Now they're not arrogant like that anymore.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:11.828]  They've had those big fat smiles wiped right off their stinking faces.
[00:39:11.828 --> 00:39:17.854]  But we have their blueprint, we have their operation, we can stop them, and Trump has rammed his foot
[00:39:21.212 --> 00:39:27.017]  In the big door and it's bleeding and it's smashed and he knows though everybody's gonna be slaves.
[00:39:27.017 --> 00:39:30.179]  His family, us, you, the prosperity, all gone.
[00:39:30.179 --> 00:39:32.481]  He doesn't like wrecking a good big powerful country.
[00:39:32.481 --> 00:39:33.882]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:39:33.882 --> 00:39:39.506]  He doesn't need to piss on America to feel big and he's sitting there with his foot bleeding and smashed.
[00:39:39.506 --> 00:39:40.007]  And guess what?
[00:39:40.007 --> 00:39:41.948]  My foot's shoved in the door too.
[00:39:41.948 --> 00:39:43.730]  And your foot's shoved in the door.
[00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.872]  With what you go through at work and church and life for standing up for what's right.
[00:39:46.872 --> 00:39:48.053]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:39:48.053 --> 00:39:49.835]  Everybody better stick their foot in the door
[00:39:51.072 --> 00:39:52.032]  And then do something else.
[00:39:52.032 --> 00:39:58.314]  Take your fingers and stick them in there and start pushing and pulling that door open.
[00:39:58.314 --> 00:40:02.415]  And that's what's starting to happen.
[00:40:02.415 --> 00:40:06.236]  Is that they want to smash those of us that already have our foot in the door, but guess what?
[00:40:06.236 --> 00:40:08.917]  More people's feet are going in the door right now.
[00:40:08.917 --> 00:40:12.557]  And the cavalry's coming up over the hill, and the globalists are in full panic mode.
[00:40:12.557 --> 00:40:14.618]  I said I'd get to all these clips, I did in this segment.
[00:40:14.618 --> 00:40:17.999]  Next segment I'll get into all of her lying, all of her deception.
[00:40:19.812 --> 00:40:23.533]  And the rest of their official stories, the wheel's coming off.
[00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:30.374]  And I saw the talking points from Swallow's Well and Cory Booker and all the rest of them on the news this morning while I was working out.
[00:40:30.374 --> 00:40:43.176]  And the new talking point is, it doesn't matter, fine, investigate Kavanaugh, investigate Ford, investigate all of them, just now there's too big a cloud, just push it off or remove the nominee.
[00:40:43.176 --> 00:40:46.117]  Well, they vote him down on Friday because Mitch McConnell says that vote's coming.
[00:40:49.855 --> 00:40:53.478]  They're talking about re-nominating him again.
[00:40:53.478 --> 00:41:01.944]  That's what Lindsey Graham's talking about, and buying more time to let things unravel even more.
[00:41:01.944 --> 00:41:07.649]  We'll see what unfolds, but Graham seems to be committed to Kavanaugh and really angry about the bullying and stuff he's seen, so...
[00:41:09.318 --> 00:41:25.170]  His stock's gone way up in my mind, and a lot of experts have said, look, McCain rode herd on him, and kept his thumb on him, and that Graham could be like Darth Vader, you know, at the end he can throw the Emperor down the mine shaft, or down the reactor shaft, and that is certainly something we'd like to see.
[00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:29.553]  So, it's always, you know, not too late to join the good side.
[00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:30.994]  We welcome everybody to come on over.
[00:41:31.935 --> 00:41:40.861]  And let's just bring back the family and bring back the right to religious freedom and the Second Amendment and private property and let's just be successful and kick ass together and let's move.
[00:41:40.861 --> 00:41:42.162]  Let's do it!
[00:41:42.162 --> 00:41:45.564]  And let's shut down all the racist crap and let's just come together.
[00:41:45.564 --> 00:41:50.047]  That's all Trump wants before he tells everybody he works for him.
[00:41:50.047 --> 00:41:50.607]  Prosperity.
[00:41:50.607 --> 00:41:51.147]  Be strong.
[00:41:51.147 --> 00:41:51.568]  Have courage.
[00:41:51.568 --> 00:41:53.049]  Bring people together.
[00:41:53.049 --> 00:41:54.610]  Hire minorities.
[00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:58.432]  Build them up.
[00:41:58.432 --> 00:41:59.453]  Give your employees raises.
[00:42:02.108 --> 00:42:03.148]  That's going to get the economy going?
[00:42:03.148 --> 00:42:05.589]  Get up off your ass, America.
[00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:09.130]  He's talking to the manager class and the owner class.
[00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.370]  We're going to lose everything if we don't bet on this country now.
[00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:13.871]  People say, man, you've always been anti-government.
[00:42:13.871 --> 00:42:14.831]  Why are you 100% behind?
[00:42:14.831 --> 00:42:16.611]  Because we finally got our government back.
[00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:17.972]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[00:42:17.972 --> 00:42:19.292]  Doesn't mean it ain't going to make mistakes.
[00:42:19.292 --> 00:42:20.752]  This is our government.
[00:42:20.752 --> 00:42:22.173]  It's our country.
[00:42:22.173 --> 00:42:23.273]  It's been a damn good country.
[00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:28.261]  So I'm going to fight.
[00:42:28.261 --> 00:42:28.881]  I'm going to go down.
[00:42:28.881 --> 00:42:32.242]  You know, they've picked me as an example to be destroyed, to demoralize you.
[00:42:32.242 --> 00:42:35.423]  Do not get upset about the persecution.
[00:42:35.423 --> 00:42:35.903]  Back us.
[00:42:35.903 --> 00:42:37.344]  Pray for us.
[00:42:37.344 --> 00:42:39.324]  I want to make it through this, but it's God's plan.
[00:42:39.324 --> 00:42:41.044]  I feel good about whatever happens.
[00:42:41.044 --> 00:42:43.065]  Because we've already done some great things together.
[00:42:43.065 --> 00:42:46.186]  And I think we're going to do even greater things, but it doesn't matter.
[00:42:46.186 --> 00:42:50.707]  It's making that spiritual decision to get close to God that really matters in eternity.
[00:42:50.707 --> 00:42:54.408]  I'm going to get into Ford's testimony, and now it's been pouring to shreds, and we come right back.
[00:42:54.408 --> 00:42:54.828]  Stay with us.

[00:47:03.816 --> 00:47:06.437]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.235 --> 00:47:26.092]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:26.092 --> 00:47:27.376]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:47:48.393 --> 00:47:49.554]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:49.554 --> 00:47:54.978]  I'm going to get into the meat and potatoes now of Wazi Ford and others.
[00:47:54.978 --> 00:47:56.499]  It's all just disintegrating.
[00:47:56.499 --> 00:47:59.481]  It always disintegrated.
[00:47:59.481 --> 00:48:00.822]  And then it's worse than we thought.
[00:48:00.822 --> 00:48:01.943]  She's a globetrotter.
[00:48:02.884 --> 00:48:05.386]  Costa Rica, New Zealand.
[00:48:05.386 --> 00:48:15.133]  She trains people, reportedly, as a psychologist, of course, that works in strange DARPA programs with her whole family and the CIA about how to get around lie detectors.
[00:48:15.133 --> 00:48:17.714]  Gee, wonder who trains people for that.
[00:48:17.714 --> 00:48:19.055]  And just all of it.
[00:48:19.055 --> 00:48:21.697]  It's ridiculous.
[00:48:21.697 --> 00:48:25.500]  But now they've moved on just saying, well, you can't have Kavanaugh, period.
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:26.500]  Will he get confirmed?
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.002]  It's on the razor's edge.
[00:48:28.002 --> 00:48:30.223]  Will it get pushed back past Friday?
[00:48:30.223 --> 00:48:30.984]  McConnell says no.
[00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.644]  Einstein thinks she can stop it.
[00:48:35.644 --> 00:48:36.245]  Disgraceful.
[00:48:36.245 --> 00:48:37.585]  Let's start going to the clips.
[00:48:37.585 --> 00:48:38.445]  Here's a flashback.
[00:48:38.445 --> 00:48:41.846]  Christine Ford is questioned about her fear of flying.
[00:48:41.846 --> 00:48:47.707]  And again, the articles are on Infowars.com of her traveling the world just recently.
[00:48:47.707 --> 00:48:52.068]  And her boyfriend, former boyfriend, said she was never afraid of flights.
[00:48:52.068 --> 00:48:55.669]  And I sat there and saw her train her friend how to take a polygraph test.
[00:48:55.669 --> 00:48:56.869]  Here it is.
[00:48:56.869 --> 00:48:59.350]  May I ask, Dr. Ford, how did you get to Washington?
[00:49:01.714 --> 00:49:03.095]  In an airplane.
[00:49:03.095 --> 00:49:04.475]  Okay.
[00:49:04.475 --> 00:49:12.638]  I asked that because it's been reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because of your fear of flying.
[00:49:12.638 --> 00:49:13.819]  Is that true?
[00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:22.002]  Well, I was willing, I was hoping that they would come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request.
[00:49:22.002 --> 00:49:23.822]  It would have been a quicker trip for me.
[00:49:23.822 --> 00:49:26.103]  Look at the mousy act.
[00:49:26.103 --> 00:49:27.464]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[00:49:28.115 --> 00:49:40.101]  That was certainly what I was hoping, was to avoid having to get on an airplane, but I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane.
[00:49:40.101 --> 00:49:50.246]  When you were here in the mid-Atlantic area back in August, end of July, August, how did you get here?
[00:49:50.246 --> 00:49:51.487]  Also by airplane.
[00:49:51.487 --> 00:49:55.029]  I come here once a year during the summer to visit my family.
[00:49:55.029 --> 00:49:55.889]  I'm sorry, not here.
[00:49:55.889 --> 00:49:56.930]  I go to Delaware.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.142]  Okay.
[00:50:00.142 --> 00:50:05.747]  In fact, you fly fairly frequently for your hobbies, and you've had to fly for your work.
[00:50:05.747 --> 00:50:06.708]  Is that true?
[00:50:06.708 --> 00:50:09.831]  Correct, unfortunately.
[00:50:09.831 --> 00:50:13.214]  You were a consulting biostatistician in Sydney, Australia.
[00:50:13.214 --> 00:50:14.696]  Is that right?
[00:50:14.696 --> 00:50:21.402]  I've never been to Australia, but the company that I worked for is based in Australia, and they have an office in San Francisco, California.
[00:50:21.402 --> 00:50:22.282]  Okay.
[00:50:22.282 --> 00:50:23.684]  I don't think I'll make it to Australia.
[00:50:25.535 --> 00:50:27.095]  It is long.
[00:50:27.095 --> 00:50:37.978]  I also saw on your CV that you list the following interests of surf travel, and you in parentheses put Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Pacific Islands, and French Polynesia.
[00:50:37.978 --> 00:50:39.878]  Have you been all to those places?
[00:50:39.878 --> 00:50:41.058]  Correct.
[00:50:41.058 --> 00:50:42.019]  By airplane?
[00:50:42.019 --> 00:50:42.959]  Yes.
[00:50:42.959 --> 00:50:50.340]  And your interests also include... I fall asleep on three and four hour flights, and Europe's okay, but let me tell you something.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.641]  Fifteen hour flights, I've done them, I dread them.
[00:50:54.926 --> 00:50:59.530]  Just because after like 10 hours you're like, get me out of this damn thing.
[00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:01.432]  Starts getting claustrophobic.
[00:51:01.432 --> 00:51:02.813]  This woman loves it.
[00:51:02.813 --> 00:51:04.975]  Oh, but she couldn't fly the week before.
[00:51:04.975 --> 00:51:06.356]  She was afraid.
[00:51:06.356 --> 00:51:07.096]  I'm afraid.
[00:51:07.096 --> 00:51:10.219]  I'm a little baby.
[00:51:10.219 --> 00:51:18.206]  I work in implanted memories at a DARPA facility and do stuff for the defense language school and everything, but I, my whole family's in the CIA.
[00:51:18.206 --> 00:51:20.928]  I level, but I'm a sweet little lady.
[00:51:23.823 --> 00:51:25.264]  I can't come.
[00:51:25.264 --> 00:51:27.446]  You need to wait a few weeks and delay it.
[00:51:27.446 --> 00:51:30.028]  I'm scared.
[00:51:30.028 --> 00:51:31.449]  I'm scared now.
[00:51:31.449 --> 00:51:34.771]  I have PTSD.
[00:51:34.771 --> 00:51:35.512]  I'm scared.
[00:51:35.512 --> 00:51:36.472]  But look at the real face.
[00:51:36.472 --> 00:51:40.995]  Cause I saw she would go from like the little fake act like.
[00:51:40.995 --> 00:51:43.797]  Like straw.
[00:51:43.797 --> 00:51:44.838]  The country's ours.
[00:51:44.838 --> 00:51:47.740]  Stop pushing.
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.321]  It's our control now.
[00:51:49.321 --> 00:51:52.364]  Did you put the meme back up of her next to
[00:51:54.437 --> 00:51:56.479]  Next to Strock, please.
[00:51:56.479 --> 00:52:03.564]  When they're both making that face like... Kind of like Private Pyle in Full Metal Jacket.
[00:52:03.564 --> 00:52:05.425]  I am in a world of you know what?
[00:52:05.425 --> 00:52:09.628]  I'm cheatin'!
[00:52:09.628 --> 00:52:16.193]  It's our country now!
[00:52:16.193 --> 00:52:17.014]  Get out of the way!
[00:52:19.033 --> 00:52:25.469]  The pleasure of being in power and having control and implanting memories.
[00:52:32.328 --> 00:52:33.569]  Let's go back to the clip, sir.
[00:52:33.569 --> 00:52:35.590]  So, continuing.
[00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:42.072]  Here she is, Ford explains why she decided to take a polygraph test, and now they've had the FBI guy on Fox.
[00:52:42.072 --> 00:52:43.593]  We've got the clip.
[00:52:43.593 --> 00:52:44.614]  He gave her two questions.
[00:52:44.614 --> 00:52:49.536]  You give someone 20 plus questions if it's a real one, and still it's not conclusive.
[00:52:49.536 --> 00:52:52.697]  20 plus just to get their reading before you ask the real questions.
[00:52:52.697 --> 00:52:56.219]  A real polygraph has over a hundred questions.
[00:52:56.219 --> 00:52:56.879]  That's on average.
[00:52:59.753 --> 00:53:01.714]  But she got two.
[00:53:01.714 --> 00:53:03.814]  Let's continue.
[00:53:03.814 --> 00:53:05.935]  Where she explains why she decided to take a polygraph.
[00:53:05.935 --> 00:53:11.397]  And now her ex-boyfriend says that he saw her helping train someone on how to pass one.
[00:53:11.397 --> 00:53:12.598]  Here it is.
[00:53:12.598 --> 00:53:18.520]  Based on the advice of the council, I was happy to undergo the polygraph test.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.481]  Although I found it extremely stressful.
[00:53:22.481 --> 00:53:24.122]  Much longer than I anticipated.
[00:53:25.567 --> 00:53:29.771]  I told my whole life story, I felt like, but I endured it.
[00:53:29.771 --> 00:53:31.573]  It was fine.
[00:53:31.573 --> 00:53:34.256]  I understand they can be that way.
[00:53:34.256 --> 00:53:38.180]  Have you ever taken any other polygraphs in your life?
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:38.500]  Never.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.282]  Okay.
[00:53:40.282 --> 00:53:47.769]  You went to see a gentleman by the name of Jeremiah Hannafin to serve as the polygrapher.
[00:53:47.769 --> 00:53:49.611]  Did anyone advise you on that choice?
[00:53:54.155 --> 00:53:55.836]  Attorney Clyde Privilege.
[00:53:55.836 --> 00:53:57.836]  And she's got literally the deep state top lawyer.
[00:53:57.836 --> 00:54:01.117]  Yes, I believe his name was Jerry.
[00:54:01.117 --> 00:54:02.358]  Jerry Hanifin.
[00:54:02.358 --> 00:54:02.618]  Yeah.
[00:54:02.618 --> 00:54:03.458]  And he has two questions.
[00:54:03.458 --> 00:54:05.098]  Did anyone advise you on that choice?
[00:54:05.098 --> 00:54:10.040]  I don't understand the... By the way, that's not a polygraph test!
[00:54:11.733 --> 00:54:14.636]  Uh, person that came to do the polygraph test.
[00:54:14.636 --> 00:54:16.577]  That's your name, your parents, where you work, what you do?
[00:54:16.577 --> 00:54:23.963]  He actually conducted the polygraph, not in his office in Virginia, but actually at the hotel next to Baltimore Washington Airport.
[00:54:23.963 --> 00:54:24.844]  Is that right?
[00:54:24.844 --> 00:54:25.545]  Correct.
[00:54:25.545 --> 00:54:28.147]  Why was that location chosen for the polygraph?
[00:54:29.434 --> 00:54:39.499]  I had left my grandmother's funeral at Fort Lincoln Cemetery that day and was on tight schedule to get a plane to Manchester, New Hampshire.
[00:54:39.499 --> 00:54:42.380]  So he was willing to come to me, which was appreciated.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:50.745]  And then she goes on to say she's never known anything about polygraphs, doesn't even know what they are.
[00:54:50.745 --> 00:54:52.405]  It might have been the next day.
[00:54:52.405 --> 00:54:53.506]  I spent the night in the hotel.
[00:54:53.506 --> 00:54:57.308]  I don't remember the exact day.
[00:54:59.417 --> 00:55:02.182]  He's a literal mind control doctor.
[00:55:02.182 --> 00:55:08.232]  Have you ever had discussions with anyone besides your attorney on how to take a polygraph?
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.860]  Never.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.480]  Oh, no.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.141]  She just knows about mind control, not about polygraphs.
[00:55:17.141 --> 00:55:20.762]  Just any sort of tips or anything like that.
[00:55:20.762 --> 00:55:22.242]  Oh, no, no.
[00:55:22.242 --> 00:55:26.303]  No, I was scared of the test itself.
[00:55:26.303 --> 00:55:27.884]  Oh, she's scared.
[00:55:27.884 --> 00:55:28.704]  Hit pause.
[00:55:28.704 --> 00:55:30.504]  She's like, I'm scared.
[00:55:30.504 --> 00:55:32.485]  I'm scared I can't fly.
[00:55:32.485 --> 00:55:33.985]  I can't in my little shell.
[00:55:33.985 --> 00:55:36.365]  But the reviews in college said she's the worst.
[00:55:36.365 --> 00:55:37.146]  She's vindictive.
[00:55:37.146 --> 00:55:37.766]  She's lazy.
[00:55:37.766 --> 00:55:38.326]  She's horrible.
[00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:43.465]  She's into group hypnosis, brainwashing.
[00:55:43.465 --> 00:55:46.946]  But she's a scared little girl!
[00:55:46.946 --> 00:55:49.586]  And she's... Go back that up ten seconds.
[00:55:49.586 --> 00:55:52.067]  Ryan Stelter says she's scared.
[00:55:52.067 --> 00:55:54.868]  Let's hear it again.
[00:55:54.868 --> 00:55:59.149]  Any sort of tips or anything like that?
[00:55:59.149 --> 00:56:03.330]  No, I was scared of the test itself.
[00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:07.631]  I was comfortable that I could tell the information.
[00:56:09.686 --> 00:56:12.668]  I mean, who do you think they're going to get to go up and say this?
[00:56:12.668 --> 00:56:16.850]  A mind control doctor hooked into DARPA, the whole family's in the CIA, I rest my case.
[00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:22.633]  We're going to go to Bright, come back and play some of the other clubs, and then I'm going to get into all the other news and open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:56:22.633 --> 00:56:26.656]  And I got Mitch McConnell saying we're not going to be intimidated, we're not going to back down.
[00:56:26.656 --> 00:56:32.419]  The Democrats pushing this far have finally gotten the bluebloods out of their damn coma, and this is a good day for America.
[00:56:32.419 --> 00:56:33.880]  I smell victory.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.721]  The polls are way up in battleground states.
[00:56:38.204 --> 00:56:42.246]  But we won't be laughing when the Democrats with rogue troops set off a nuke and kill the President.
[00:56:42.246 --> 00:56:45.288]  I mean, let me tell you, they'll do anything.
[00:56:45.288 --> 00:56:48.170]  That said, you know, I've been forced to sue PayPal because it's mark of the beast.
[00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:52.172]  They're buying up all the online companies and online wallets so you can't buy or sell.
[00:56:52.172 --> 00:56:54.173]  Like in China, you're not a good globalist.
[00:56:54.173 --> 00:56:56.394]  So I'm doing this to inform the President.
[00:56:56.394 --> 00:57:02.758]  I'm going to air, really, our strategy to PayPal and all the other arrogant folks.
[00:57:02.758 --> 00:57:06.380]  I can't expect the President to take action if I don't take action.
[00:57:07.162 --> 00:57:14.079]  So, I told the White House, and I told the campaign, and I told national people that I'm going to sue.
[00:57:15.711 --> 00:57:18.912]  And I'm sure you can figure that out why I'm doing that.
[00:57:18.912 --> 00:57:21.553]  It's now a national story, dumbasses.
[00:57:21.553 --> 00:57:29.855]  And now, the President will prepare action against persecution against conservatives and Christians by banking institutions.
[00:57:29.855 --> 00:57:32.616]  You think you're playing games with somebody here?
[00:57:32.616 --> 00:57:33.956]  Fools?
[00:57:33.956 --> 00:57:34.797]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:34.797 --> 00:57:36.877]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.

[00:58:50.137 --> 00:58:57.660]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:58:59.241 --> 00:59:10.089]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:59:10.089 --> 00:59:12.190]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:16.193]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:16.193 --> 00:59:17.414]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[00:59:17.634 --> 00:59:23.438]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:59:23.438 --> 00:59:25.840]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.481]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:59:28.481 --> 00:59:31.263]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:59:31.263 --> 00:59:33.765]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:33.765 --> 00:59:42.951]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:59:42.951 --> 00:59:47.414]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:59:53.298 --> 00:59:55.879]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:18.627 --> 01:00:22.732]  And that sun is high.
[01:00:22.732 --> 01:00:30.520]  You know, I'm proud to see Texas in the fight against globalism.
[01:00:41.886 --> 01:00:48.129]  I'm glad that Infowars operations against the New World Order are seen as the most deadly weapon, other than Trump, in the fight.
[01:00:48.129 --> 01:00:51.870]  I'm proud of Texas, yet again, the spirit rising.
[01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:54.872]  But the California collapsing is trying to seize our state.
[01:00:54.872 --> 01:01:09.418]  Every news channel, even local conservative radio, puts down Senator Cruz, worships that hit-and-run, drunk-driving, anti-gun, pervert, pedo-bedo, or bedo, whatever his name is.
[01:01:09.418 --> 01:01:11.179]  We'll be talking about that more coming up late.
[01:01:12.284 --> 01:01:14.044]  I'll be looking for 8 when they pull that gate.
[01:01:14.044 --> 01:01:19.425]  And I'm here to tell you, we've got the poll numbers I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:01:19.425 --> 01:01:20.666]  6, 7, 8, to 15, to 20.
[01:01:20.666 --> 01:01:30.947]  On average, about 12 points gains by Republicans in battleground states since this whole Kavanaugh fiasco.
[01:01:30.947 --> 01:01:36.929]  Now, I was getting to know the wheels are coming off of this, and this woman's this global, global trotter.
[01:01:36.929 --> 01:01:38.669]  I mean, she's all over the world.
[01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:40.231]  I don't think so.
[01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:01.514]  She's going through a lot right now.
[01:02:01.514 --> 01:02:03.936]  There's something wrong with her, my friend.
[01:02:03.936 --> 01:02:05.777]  And so she just told me to talk to her lawyer.
[01:02:05.777 --> 01:02:08.098]  But yeah, the lawyer said it didn't happen, lady.
[01:02:08.098 --> 01:02:11.701]  But the media keeps going with, you've got all these witnesses in your own testimony.
[01:02:11.701 --> 01:02:13.442]  You kept saying you had all these witnesses.
[01:02:13.442 --> 01:02:15.964]  Lying again!
[01:02:15.964 --> 01:02:17.164]  God!
[01:02:17.164 --> 01:02:20.427]  Oh, but even the New York Times can't even say, oh, is she credible?
[01:02:20.427 --> 01:02:21.807]  Oh, we're so sorry!
[01:02:21.807 --> 01:02:23.128]  You can't ask if she's credible.
[01:02:23.128 --> 01:02:28.092]  I mean, she's a bug-eyed, Hillary-supporting, man-hating,
[01:02:30.843 --> 01:02:32.983]  Spook, in my view.
[01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:35.344]  Hell, we know her whole family is.
[01:02:35.344 --> 01:02:38.965]  And she's the nasty academic type that perches on top of the country.
[01:02:38.965 --> 01:02:42.926]  Not the spooks that actually do the killing and the fighting all over the world.
[01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:43.486]  No, no, no.
[01:02:43.486 --> 01:02:48.727]  She's the little wimp version that perches up there on top of all of us, like Reality Winner.
[01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:52.828]  She should be Reality Winner's mommy!
[01:02:52.828 --> 01:02:54.348]  Well, guess what, bloodsuckers?
[01:02:54.348 --> 01:02:54.848]  We're awake!
[01:02:55.964 --> 01:03:02.086]  Listen to this sickening exchange where she throws her friend under the bus for saying she's not telling the truth.
[01:03:02.086 --> 01:03:03.027]  Here it is.
[01:03:03.027 --> 01:03:12.290]  When you did leave that night, did Leland Kaiser, now Kaiser, ever follow up with you and say, hey, what happened to you?
[01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:16.432]  I've had communications with her recently.
[01:03:16.432 --> 01:03:18.313]  I'm talking about like the next day.
[01:03:18.313 --> 01:03:20.514]  Oh no, she didn't know about the event.
[01:03:20.514 --> 01:03:23.655]  She was downstairs during the event and I did not share it with her.
[01:03:25.603 --> 01:03:36.249]  Are you aware that the three people at the party besides yourself and Brett Kavanaugh have given statements under penalty of felony to the committee?
[01:03:36.249 --> 01:03:36.850]  Yes.
[01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:38.831]  And are you aware of what those statements say?
[01:03:38.831 --> 01:03:40.132]  Yes.
[01:03:40.132 --> 01:03:46.356]  Are you aware that they say that they have no memory or knowledge of such a party?
[01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:49.177]  Yes.
[01:03:49.177 --> 01:03:52.179]  Do you have any particular motives to ascribe to Leland?
[01:03:54.218 --> 01:03:56.379]  I guess we could take those one at a time.
[01:03:56.379 --> 01:04:21.128]  Leland has significant health challenges and I'm happy that she's focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs and she let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her and she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes and etc.
[01:04:21.128 --> 01:04:22.969]  So I'm glad that she's taking care of herself.
[01:04:25.063 --> 01:04:26.744]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:26.744 --> 01:04:30.125]  We're going to come back on the other side of this quick break and continue looking at this.
[01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:39.069]  And then Owen Benjamin, a well-known comedian and actor, is going to weigh in on this and tell some of his own life stories here on air.
[01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:42.011]  And I don't want anybody to question it.
[01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:45.752]  Look, you know, he's smiling and laughing about it, but it's because he's under stress.
[01:04:45.752 --> 01:04:46.513]  Okay?
[01:04:46.513 --> 01:04:49.034]  He's got a lot of courage.
[01:04:49.034 --> 01:04:53.136]  What Matt Damon did to him, I'm not even going to question what Matt Damon did to him,
[01:04:54.565 --> 01:04:57.071]  Because, you know, Benjamin's a little guy and Damon held him down.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.962]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:05:00.962 --> 01:05:07.327]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[01:05:07.327 --> 01:05:09.088]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[01:05:09.088 --> 01:05:15.953]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[01:05:15.953 --> 01:05:22.137]  Made with ancient ingredients used for thousands of years, Happies can help you take back the day.
[01:05:22.137 --> 01:05:26.220]  With our powerhouse formula, Happies can be an important part
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:26.580]  I think so.
[01:06:02.466 --> 01:06:09.052]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:12.956]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:06:20.558 --> 01:06:33.989]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:40.994]  We are about to air the video proof that Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, and the DNC
[01:06:42.293 --> 01:06:53.982]  Are behind the move to ban InfoWars and then every other major conservative or libertarian or nationalist or Christian or pro-gun or veteran group off the internet.
[01:06:53.982 --> 01:07:04.910]  It's in the WikiLeaks from three years ago, but it's in her statements going back a year and a half ago, right through last month, where she brags how they define InfoWars as fake news
[01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:08.791]  And Russian propaganda to make America great again.
[01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:16.915]  And how she got Big Tech to then, ahead of the midterms, only 30-something days out, to ban us.
[01:07:16.915 --> 01:07:29.120]  This is an admission of racketeering, an admission of antitrust, an admission of civil rights violations, an admission of Big Tech corporate Democrat-run mafia.
[01:07:30.356 --> 01:07:36.581]  Crushing InfoWars and your ability to comment on our articles and our videos.
[01:07:36.581 --> 01:07:38.582]  We're going to air this piece right now.
[01:07:38.582 --> 01:07:40.184]  This is so incredibly important.
[01:07:40.184 --> 01:07:46.989]  This is a big deal because if they can shut down InfoWars, they can shut everybody down and that's their plan.
[01:07:46.989 --> 01:07:49.371]  Demonize us, get people to abandon us.
[01:07:50.484 --> 01:07:53.865]  So the next person they attack, nobody stands up as well.
[01:07:53.865 --> 01:07:56.346]  They believe they're breaking your will right now.
[01:07:56.346 --> 01:07:59.387]  I believe they're waking you up.
[01:07:59.387 --> 01:08:01.667]  This is what the witch had to say herself.
[01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:03.608]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:08:03.608 --> 01:08:05.028]  And I tell you all of it.
[01:08:05.028 --> 01:08:11.250]  I could literally keep you here all night because the stories are just so unbelievable.
[01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:13.011]  This is coming to a theater near you.
[01:08:18.592 --> 01:08:25.936]  The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year.
[01:08:25.936 --> 01:08:32.459]  It's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.
[01:08:32.459 --> 01:08:37.742]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counter-intel people I've talked to,
[01:08:38.662 --> 01:08:44.364]  Could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[01:08:44.364 --> 01:08:46.484]  And here's a... Guided by Americans.
[01:08:46.484 --> 01:08:48.085]  Guided by Americans.
[01:08:48.085 --> 01:08:56.507]  And so voters who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up their minds.
[01:08:56.507 --> 01:08:57.928]  What does it mean?
[01:08:57.928 --> 01:09:01.109]  It's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly.
[01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:13.959]  Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news.
[01:09:13.959 --> 01:09:24.267]  There have been a series of studies, academic studies, since the election trying to figure out why people voted the way they did because it defied all the polls.
[01:09:24.267 --> 01:09:26.009]  Nobody was ready for it.
[01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:35.512]  And people relied on what they saw in the media, but even more so online.
[01:09:35.512 --> 01:09:46.335]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:09:46.335 --> 01:09:49.056]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:09:49.056 --> 01:09:51.377]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:54.311]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:09:54.311 --> 01:09:55.791]  I will not let you down.
[01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:58.732]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:09:58.732 --> 01:10:04.974]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[01:10:04.974 --> 01:10:16.777]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[01:10:16.977 --> 01:10:23.063]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[01:10:23.063 --> 01:10:27.527]  Social media giants acting this time before it's too late.
[01:10:27.527 --> 01:10:28.327]  Their goal?
[01:10:28.327 --> 01:10:32.191]  To prevent fake news and propaganda from influencing the upcoming U.S.
[01:10:32.191 --> 01:10:33.272]  midterm election.
[01:10:33.272 --> 01:10:36.054]  I'm glad that the Congress and others are looking
[01:10:36.935 --> 01:10:47.621]  At Facebook and Twitter and Google because they are the vehicles, one of the very first vehicles to deliver this kind of information to people.
[01:10:47.621 --> 01:10:49.963]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:10:49.963 --> 01:11:05.832]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:11:06.092 --> 01:11:14.140]  If something popped up in a Facebook feed and looked like a news report, people were inclined to believe it.
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:25.152]  And if they were already targeted psychologically to be receptive to the information provided, they were influenceable.
[01:11:25.532 --> 01:11:28.373]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[01:11:28.373 --> 01:11:31.615]  The White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[01:11:31.615 --> 01:11:41.220]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadowbanning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:51.025]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[01:12:01.744 --> 01:12:13.992]  Now, I'm going to air a video of Owen Benjamin breaking down what he says happened to him at the hands of Matt Damon.
[01:12:13.992 --> 01:12:16.613]  Now, I did an intro video last night.
[01:12:16.613 --> 01:12:17.494]  That's not the one I want to air.
[01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:24.414]  I want to air the one specifically with just what he said so people can see this for themselves.
[01:12:24.414 --> 01:12:28.457]  We're going to be talking to Owen Benjamin here.
[01:12:28.457 --> 01:12:33.161]  So again, let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:12:33.161 --> 01:12:41.807]  I'm finally ready because of the courage of Christine Blasey Ford to come forward in such a terrible time to tell my story.
[01:12:41.807 --> 01:12:46.371]  And I need to be believed.
[01:12:46.371 --> 01:12:47.031]  I was raped.
[01:12:48.291 --> 01:12:50.893]  By Matt Damon.
[01:12:50.893 --> 01:13:01.840]  I don't remember exactly what year, but it was right around when Good Will Hunting came out, and there was no Good Will when he hunted me and raped me.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:05.743]  Amy, do you remember me telling you that?
[01:13:05.743 --> 01:13:07.604]  Yeah, totally.
[01:13:07.604 --> 01:13:08.045]  You remember?
[01:13:08.045 --> 01:13:10.907]  Yeah.
[01:13:10.907 --> 01:13:12.208]  Oh, look.
[01:13:12.208 --> 01:13:13.789]  A woman.
[01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:14.469]  She remembers.
[01:13:14.469 --> 01:13:16.651]  Do you remember that I said he raped me?
[01:13:18.214 --> 01:13:21.896]  Yeah, totally.
[01:13:21.896 --> 01:13:24.677]  Matt Damon, it's time for the reckoning.
[01:13:24.677 --> 01:13:32.961]  You raped me, and now I'm gonna... I want 750 grand.
[01:13:32.961 --> 01:13:39.924]  Article, Matt Damon accused of rape, and then it goes on to point out that this is him illustrating what's going on with absurdity.
[01:13:39.924 --> 01:13:43.345]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:13:43.345 --> 01:13:44.766]  He does hang out with his best buddies.
[01:13:45.771 --> 01:13:50.113]  With a known serial rapist and assaulter, Harvey Weinstein.
[01:13:50.113 --> 01:13:57.676]  So it has more credibility, uh, as does his associations and his Hollywood, uh, than it does to say this about Kavanaugh.
[01:13:57.676 --> 01:14:03.738]  Uh, but you were going to be here in studio today, but I heard that Matt Damon sabotaged your flight.
[01:14:03.738 --> 01:14:07.100]  There's no need for due process or proof, uh, is there Owen Benjamin?
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:15.203]  Uh, just because you are accusing a man of something because Matt Damon is a man, uh, we've got to go ahead and I guess she should ever work again, right?
[01:14:16.058 --> 01:14:25.623]  Yeah, I mean, I was always very skeptical of the Me Too movement because I thought it was a pound symbol, so I thought it was pound me too, which is very confusing.
[01:14:25.623 --> 01:14:35.388]  But when I saw Matt Damon on Saturday Night Live mocking an innocent man, the voice, his voice triggered something in me and I remember him raping me.
[01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:38.570]  I don't know the time or the place.
[01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:43.313]  I remember when he was finished, he said, how do you like them apples?
[01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:45.494]  And that's when I started to weep.
[01:14:46.366 --> 01:14:53.088]  And I guess that's all the information you really need these days to get, you know, $750,000.
[01:14:53.088 --> 01:15:01.531]  And as you saw, my wife, who's half-minority, she's half-Hispanic, so that gives her even more credibility.
[01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:09.274]  She's a woman and also half-not-white, so I think it's a crime to not believe that she's telling the truth that I didn't tell her.
[01:15:09.274 --> 01:15:12.335]  Well, that's what Maisie, the senator in Hawaii, said.
[01:15:12.335 --> 01:15:14.376]  She said, men just sit down and shut up.
[01:15:15.379 --> 01:15:26.466]  Yeah, but it's time for me to stand up and tell my story that Matt Damon, Academy Award winning Matt Damon, gave me the hard R. And he never apologized and he never looked sad.
[01:15:26.466 --> 01:15:28.207]  He's a big guy, you're a little guy.
[01:15:28.207 --> 01:15:32.270]  Yeah, I'm 6'7", and he's about 5'9", but in my mind he was about 9'8".
[01:15:40.226 --> 01:15:42.350]  And, uh, and that's credible.
[01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:43.652]  Well, I appreciate your courage.
[01:15:43.652 --> 01:15:46.496]  Let's talk about what he did to you.
[01:15:46.496 --> 01:15:49.160]  When he... We know how you rape a guy.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.123]  Oh, this is terrible.
[01:15:51.123 --> 01:15:52.605]  He got a lot of courage right now.
[01:15:52.605 --> 01:15:54.908]  Matt Damon's got a lot of explaining to do.
[01:15:54.908 --> 01:15:55.048]  Wow.
[01:15:57.165 --> 01:16:03.528]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.528 --> 01:16:06.570]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:12.493]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.493 --> 01:16:16.275]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.275 --> 01:16:17.555]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.555 --> 01:16:18.896]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.896 --> 01:16:25.079]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:25.079 --> 01:16:26.520]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:33.901]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.

[01:16:56.946 --> 01:17:00.829]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:05.812]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.981]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:17:27.006 --> 01:17:29.168]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[01:17:29.168 --> 01:17:29.968]  Not true.
[01:17:29.968 --> 01:17:31.809]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[01:17:31.809 --> 01:17:35.812]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[01:17:35.812 --> 01:17:36.933]  Introducing Protovite.

[01:18:02.182 --> 01:18:04.783]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[01:18:04.783 --> 01:18:05.663]  No one else has this.
[01:18:05.663 --> 01:18:08.724]  From deep earth, crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:18:08.724 --> 01:18:10.204]  It's very hard for me to get.
[01:18:10.204 --> 01:18:12.045]  It's the good halogen.
[01:18:12.045 --> 01:18:14.206]  But instead, they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[01:18:14.206 --> 01:18:20.748]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[01:18:20.748 --> 01:18:23.348]  Bio-True Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[01:18:23.348 --> 01:18:24.769]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:31.794]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:33.575]  So these go incredibly well together.
[01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:35.156]  We have a combo of those.
[01:18:35.156 --> 01:18:36.537]  Just experience it for yourself.
[01:18:36.537 --> 01:18:39.279]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[01:18:39.279 --> 01:18:40.300]  Very simple stuff.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.941]  Filter your water.
[01:18:41.941 --> 01:18:43.883]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[01:18:43.883 --> 01:18:45.604]  Best out there for the price.
[01:18:45.604 --> 01:18:46.565]  When I say it's the last run,
[01:18:47.802 --> 01:18:49.363]  I think it'll be six months to a year until we get more.
[01:18:49.363 --> 01:18:50.183]  I hope we get more.
[01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:51.504]  This is the last run it looks like.
[01:18:51.504 --> 01:18:52.385]  Survival Short X2.
[01:18:52.385 --> 01:18:58.288]  MFORWARDSHORT.COM or MFORWARDSLIFE.COM or AAA253-3139.
[01:18:58.288 --> 01:19:02.171]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:19:03.524 --> 01:19:12.206]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:14.186]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:19:14.186 --> 01:19:17.647]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:19:17.647 --> 01:19:20.247]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:19:20.247 --> 01:19:22.548]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:19:22.548 --> 01:19:29.489]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:19:30.069 --> 01:19:39.837]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:19:39.837 --> 01:19:41.038]  We'll win.
[01:19:41.038 --> 01:19:43.360]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:51.086]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:54.789]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:56.351]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[01:19:56.351 --> 01:19:57.031]  We need your support.
[01:19:57.031 --> 01:19:57.752]  I'm counting on you.
[01:20:01.303 --> 01:20:11.797]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:11.797 --> 01:20:19.427]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:51.443 --> 01:20:53.224]  Alright, I love having Owen Benjamin on the show.
[01:20:53.224 --> 01:20:55.205]  One of the most censored comedians out there.
[01:20:55.205 --> 01:20:57.386]  He's been popping on a lot, listeners love him.
[01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:01.588]  And he's been watching this whole Kavanaugh fiasco.
[01:21:01.588 --> 01:21:07.331]  Everything Ford says, everything these other women say, none of the witnesses say it happened.
[01:21:07.331 --> 01:21:08.892]  And then Ford says, well, she's sick.
[01:21:11.024 --> 01:21:25.129]  And it's just otherworldly, and then she's involved in a weird DARPA program to implant memories in people, and then she's a globetrotter, bragging how she's, you know, in Tahiti or whatever, and everywhere else, Costa Rica, and then she says, but I'm afraid to fly!
[01:21:25.129 --> 01:21:28.951]  And I was afraid of the polygraph!
[01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:34.413]  And they only gave her two questions, which is not a polygraph, maybe like 20, 30, 40 questions just to warm you up.
[01:21:35.339 --> 01:21:40.942]  But getting serious here, because it's obviously satire and you're illustrating absurdity by being absurd.
[01:21:40.942 --> 01:21:45.064]  We even said it was a joke in the article, you know, in one paragraph before the video.
[01:21:45.064 --> 01:21:48.626]  People are like, oh, how dare you say this for clickbait?
[01:21:48.626 --> 01:21:50.446]  We're not doing that.
[01:21:50.446 --> 01:21:52.007]  We're putting it out.
[01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.148]  So let's explain.
[01:21:53.148 --> 01:21:57.370]  I mean, Matt Damon really didn't rape you unless you went and I guess went to
[01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:08.294]  To this Christine Blasey Ford's class, and then she did hypnosis on you, and then I guess maybe if you believe that Matt Damon raped you, maybe it's true.
[01:22:08.294 --> 01:22:18.401]  The point we're obviously trying to make, there's more evidence that Matt Damon raped me, because there isn't five people saying that he didn't.
[01:22:18.401 --> 01:22:24.786]  Like, if we go by the leftist standard of rape accusation equals destroy an honorable man's life,
[01:22:25.544 --> 01:22:30.347]  Matt Damon is far more guilty than Judge Kavanaugh of raping me.
[01:22:30.347 --> 01:22:37.232]  Because I was going to fly down to the studio today, as you know, and I sat on a tarmac today because the plane broke for six hours.
[01:22:37.232 --> 01:22:41.875]  And allegedly, Matt Damon broke the plane because he didn't want the secret out.
[01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:44.597]  Like, there's a couple people being like, no way, it's Matt Damon.
[01:22:44.597 --> 01:22:46.478]  And I'm like, oh, that is my rapist.
[01:22:47.102 --> 01:22:50.383]  See, anyone can just make this stuff up.
[01:22:50.383 --> 01:22:51.804]  It's ridiculous.
[01:22:51.804 --> 01:22:54.925]  And we need due process because you can't prove a negative.
[01:22:54.925 --> 01:22:59.067]  I know you've had this, Alex, and I know I've had this when you're accused of something.
[01:22:59.067 --> 01:23:00.928]  You can't prove you're not something.
[01:23:00.928 --> 01:23:01.648]  It's illogic.
[01:23:02.368 --> 01:23:05.589]  Inverse, that makes it so someone can just have control over you.
[01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:18.131]  So that's why, instead of just in a constant state of backpedal, I now am just doing the same thing to them, except in a way that's obviously satire, because I don't want to bear false actual witness.
[01:23:18.131 --> 01:23:20.751]  You're not actually trying to destroy their lives, but you're lucky.
[01:23:20.751 --> 01:23:22.812]  The word is Matt Damon is a gremlin.
[01:23:22.812 --> 01:23:27.433]  He could take on that form, got into the belly of the plane, ripped up some of the avionics and things.
[01:23:27.433 --> 01:23:29.913]  Could have been worse, he could have been on the wing of the plane.
[01:23:30.752 --> 01:23:38.456]  Well, Damon wanted me to survive, though, because he doesn't want to kill his victims because he likes to know that I get triggered every time I hear, how do you like them apples?
[01:23:38.456 --> 01:23:43.719]  Or even if I use an Apple product, I think about Goodwill Hunting and, of course, the vicious rape.
[01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:47.221]  So it would have been a mercy kill if he did take down the plane and he knows that.
[01:23:47.221 --> 01:23:48.461]  Well, you're 6'7".
[01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:54.184]  How is Matt Damon in this dream, this false memory you had implanted?
[01:23:54.184 --> 01:23:55.165]  I guess it's Stanford.
[01:23:56.084 --> 01:24:01.567]  He's part elephant and he has little, and Ben Affleck was there laughing.
[01:24:01.567 --> 01:24:03.288]  All I remember is the laughter, Alex.
[01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:04.909]  I don't remember where it was.
[01:24:04.909 --> 01:24:08.532]  I just remember that there were stares and laughter.
[01:24:08.532 --> 01:24:11.473]  And for that, I want 750 grand.
[01:24:11.473 --> 01:24:14.455]  And any of my other enemies want to talk smack?
[01:24:14.455 --> 01:24:15.075]  Well, guess what?
[01:24:15.075 --> 01:24:16.777]  You were there too, raping away.
[01:24:16.777 --> 01:24:18.958]  And I want more money and I want you fired too.
[01:24:20.034 --> 01:24:24.275]  Well, she'd raised $750,000 as of the day she testified.
[01:24:24.275 --> 01:24:25.056]  What is it now?
[01:24:25.056 --> 01:24:27.476]  I heard it was over a million.
[01:24:27.476 --> 01:24:27.937]  I'm sure.
[01:24:27.937 --> 01:24:35.619]  And her ex-boyfriend just came out, I'm sure you saw this, where they used to always be on prop planes.
[01:24:35.619 --> 01:24:41.521]  He witnessed her, and he swore this, he just swore this, with fear of perjury, that
[01:24:42.259 --> 01:24:48.802]  That he witnessed her coaching another woman how to take a lie detector test, and she got him for bank fraud.
[01:24:48.802 --> 01:24:53.924]  This news just came out, like, late, late last night, and the mainstream media won't report it.
[01:24:53.924 --> 01:24:55.585]  Like, she's a proven liar.
[01:24:55.585 --> 01:24:58.626]  And that she's not afraid to fly, and it's not like we just have to believe him.
[01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:03.748]  We have the witnesses of her own saying she's a globetrotter, loves to fly, flies to places 16 hours away.
[01:25:05.663 --> 01:25:23.751]  Well, yeah, and as you know, the leftists use our own morality and our own sense of honor against us, and I'm on to them at this point, and I know you are as well, that they will just use our deference to actual victims that really do need to be heard, like the victims of Harvey Weinstein, for example.
[01:25:25.459 --> 01:25:31.503]  And they'll use that to put us in a state of fear and a state of immobility, and that is when they just acquire power.
[01:25:31.503 --> 01:25:34.304]  And if they get total power, we're in gulags.
[01:25:34.304 --> 01:25:37.466]  And that's why my role is to fight it with satire.
[01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:41.329]  Like, I'll do these It's Time videos and jokes and stuff like that.
[01:25:41.329 --> 01:25:45.591]  And that's good at waking people up to the absurdity of it.
[01:25:45.591 --> 01:25:47.532]  But, you know, everyone has their role to play.
[01:25:47.532 --> 01:25:53.296]  But at this point, more Americans need to shoulder the burden of fighting the leftist, globalist,
[01:25:53.954 --> 01:26:03.247]  Nonsense is truth, everything is power, this Machiavellian nightmare that's happening, because it's easy to beat if you just say what you believe.
[01:26:03.247 --> 01:26:07.893]  Let me ask you this question, because we're going to go to break, come back and play Mitch McConnell saying they won't be bullied by the Clefts.
[01:26:08.814 --> 01:26:34.329]  The whole show, and I'm gonna get to it when we come back, that major shifts in battleground states for Republicans, for Trump now, this somehow just the wit shine went too far and all the witnesses saying it didn't happen and her remembering not the house or the year or whatever but she had a beer and what they were wearing in the room and but she didn't tell anybody and then none of the friends say it's true and then she's a globetrotter but lied about that and then her whole family CIA leftist kook balls.
[01:26:34.329 --> 01:26:37.831]  I mean, I really think they have gone too far here.
[01:26:38.823 --> 01:26:40.806]  Yeah, they've woken up a lot of people.
[01:26:40.806 --> 01:26:49.360]  Like, I've had just this week a few people that are more higher up in LA that haven't talked to me in a while, like, text me how I'm doing and stuff.
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.907]  Because I think they finally saw that appeasement just means you get eaten last.
[01:26:54.691 --> 01:27:03.057]  And it's a lot harder to dismiss Kavanaugh, like this centrist, Eagle Scout, you know, Yale guy.
[01:27:03.057 --> 01:27:06.639]  Like, the left was trying to prove that they can do it to anybody at any time.
[01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:10.822]  Even Mike Pence, who never is alone with a woman, they could do this.
[01:27:10.822 --> 01:27:13.164]  They could say, well, a ghost was touched.
[01:27:13.164 --> 01:27:18.787]  Like, they're trying to do a power display where no one's safe, and that caused a chill.
[01:27:18.787 --> 01:27:19.828]  There's going to be a red wave, 100%.
[01:27:21.744 --> 01:27:22.705]  There's no way.
[01:27:22.705 --> 01:27:29.231]  People that I know that never would vote and think I'm crazy are like, dude, we can't let the Democrats take over the House.
[01:27:29.231 --> 01:27:30.392]  These people are insane.
[01:27:30.392 --> 01:27:33.094]  They've weaponized rape accusations!
[01:27:33.094 --> 01:27:34.475]  Like, that's a sacred thing!
[01:27:34.475 --> 01:27:36.017]  Like, rape is horrible!
[01:27:36.576 --> 01:27:40.378]  And it's like you can't do this to men because men are naturally protective.
[01:27:40.378 --> 01:27:43.020]  So we're going to believe women a lot of times.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:53.125]  And then when you see the obvious, you know, Feinstein, this archaic war leech, like when you see someone like that and their real motives, it makes you just.
[01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:55.387]  Well, that's it is they are raping the truth.
[01:27:55.387 --> 01:28:00.890]  And you have this coach saying our team got raped by the refs and he gets suspended or fired.
[01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:02.711]  We're now they're even raping language.
[01:28:03.763 --> 01:28:06.846]  Oh, well the rape of the language is how the left does it.
[01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:12.172]  I'm starting to realize the reason that they actually banned To Kill a Mockingbird, my mom teaches literature.
[01:28:13.482 --> 01:28:20.966]  It's not actually the N-word, which the real N-word is no, by the way, but it's because it shows due process.
[01:28:20.966 --> 01:28:24.827]  It shows what the story of To Kill a Mockingbird shows what happens.
[01:28:24.827 --> 01:28:28.929]  Exactly, the left, stay there when we come back, we'll talk about this, they are at war with due process.
[01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.870]  Yeah, oh yeah, because they need power all the time.
[01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:38.653]  Well, and actually the professor said while the left wanted to sit down, he's a nice white guy trying to be a good guy, which is what abolition and all that was.
[01:28:38.653 --> 01:28:39.434]  Well, you can't have.
[01:28:40.234 --> 01:28:43.139]  Gregory Peck, who was a liberal by the way, a classical liberal.
[01:28:43.139 --> 01:28:45.903]  You can't have a white guy in a good role.
[01:28:45.903 --> 01:28:50.410]  That is the new hyper-racist garbage of the weird white professor saying that.
[01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:52.293]  It's not minorities saying that.
[01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:52.974]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.305 --> 01:29:00.186]  Ever wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[01:29:00.186 --> 01:29:05.067]  Vercell Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.
[01:29:05.067 --> 01:29:10.669]  Decentralized blockchain solutions are making the world more transparent and giving power back to the people.

[01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:34.153]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:34.153 --> 01:29:37.055]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[01:33:01.221 --> 01:33:03.874]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:29.591 --> 01:33:37.894]  Coming up, I'm going to play a clip of Sarah Sanders at a press conference just minutes ago, pointing out that the Democrats have undermined the entire judicial system.
[01:33:37.894 --> 01:33:44.177]  It's not that the judicial system is perfect, or that America is perfect, but the Democrats work for globalists.
[01:33:44.177 --> 01:33:51.720]  They work for Soros, who undermines and overthrows nation-states to implode them to bring in corporate world government.
[01:33:53.123 --> 01:33:55.744]  So yes, they are an outside globalist arm.
[01:33:55.744 --> 01:33:56.825]  Owen Benjamin's our guest.
[01:33:56.825 --> 01:34:00.267]  We're going to get to some of these clips and get his take on where he thinks things are going.
[01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:02.768]  I'm going to then give the number out and take some of your calls.
[01:34:02.768 --> 01:34:09.632]  We've got a special report from the leader of the Restart Movement that is one of the main opposition groups, the mullahs in Iran.
[01:34:09.632 --> 01:34:14.515]  This is going to be a pretty big interview coming up that our own Greg Reese did.
[01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.036]  We're going to play some excerpts of that.
[01:34:16.036 --> 01:34:17.437]  The interview is now on Infowars.com.
[01:34:18.769 --> 01:34:24.310]  That said, you know, any product we launch is pretty darn powerful.
[01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:31.172]  And I had it earlier, but I took it in the other studio yesterday to shoot a video with it, and also took some of it, so it's down here with me.
[01:34:31.172 --> 01:34:42.655]  But Happies is our newest product at InfoWarsLife.com, and it's just a whole bunch of known concentrated herbs, ashwagandha root,
[01:34:44.022 --> 01:34:55.445]  Rotiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf, licorice root, and more organic concentrated that have been proven in major studies to do amazing things.
[01:34:55.445 --> 01:34:58.686]  They're not suppressants though, they just smooth you out.
[01:34:58.686 --> 01:35:01.187]  I'll start drinking a lot of this myself, I tell you.
[01:35:02.728 --> 01:35:03.969]  I want you to try it.
[01:35:03.969 --> 01:35:07.452]  And so the introductory cost is $22.47.
[01:35:07.452 --> 01:35:10.334]  Leading competitors are three times the cost of this.
[01:35:10.334 --> 01:35:13.296]  So even at $44 in normal retail, it's a great deal.
[01:35:13.296 --> 01:35:15.738]  Happy's Mood & Stress is our latest product.
[01:35:15.738 --> 01:35:16.839]  Themfulwarshaw.com.
[01:35:16.839 --> 01:35:22.323]  It is 50% off out of the gates.
[01:35:22.323 --> 01:35:29.709]  Also, this is the last day or so whenever I'm going to have some of our best-selling products at 50% off and 40% off, and that is
[01:35:32.529 --> 01:35:35.791]  Brain Force Plus, now 20% more of the Great Nootropic.
[01:35:35.791 --> 01:35:37.012]  It is 40% off.
[01:35:37.012 --> 01:35:39.134]  That's going to have to end today or tomorrow.
[01:35:39.134 --> 01:35:40.795]  We're going to have some new specials.
[01:35:40.795 --> 01:35:43.617]  And then we'll also have Supramel Vitality, 50% off.
[01:35:43.617 --> 01:35:45.358]  Supramel Vitality, 50% off.
[01:35:45.358 --> 01:35:47.179]  That's going to have to end in the next few days.
[01:35:47.179 --> 01:35:49.581]  We also have the Secret 12.
[01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:50.422]  Very high quality.
[01:35:51.482 --> 01:35:54.444]  Organic, concentrated vitamin B12 you take under the tongue.
[01:35:54.444 --> 01:35:56.265]  Look at the 97% it has.
[01:35:56.265 --> 01:35:59.027]  3,000 plus reviews on Power Reviews.
[01:35:59.027 --> 01:35:59.867]  4.9 stars.
[01:35:59.867 --> 01:36:00.988]  Read those reviews.
[01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:07.552]  It has been rated by independent third-party labs as the top vitamin B12 in the country.
[01:36:08.638 --> 01:36:09.840]  Sacred 12.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.004]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:36:12.004 --> 01:36:13.207]  It's 40% off right now.
[01:36:13.207 --> 01:36:18.116]  That's going to have to end in the next day or two because we're close to selling out of that and the Brain Force.
[01:36:18.116 --> 01:36:20.801]  But we've got plenty that just came in of Happies!
[01:36:21.924 --> 01:36:24.906]  Which is good for adults, good for children, you name it.
[01:36:24.906 --> 01:36:26.827]  It's all natural.
[01:36:26.827 --> 01:36:29.669]  It's just concentrated herbs and it is amazing.
[01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:33.911]  Declare war on stress and fatigue with Mother Nature's ultimate weapons.
[01:36:33.911 --> 01:36:34.932]  50% off.
[01:36:34.932 --> 01:36:39.734]  Happy's has what you need to support your mood and take on the day.
[01:36:39.734 --> 01:36:41.235]  And I think it's great at night as well.
[01:36:41.235 --> 01:36:42.696]  It doesn't make you tired.
[01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:45.618]  It does the opposite, but it's not a stimulant, it's not a depressant.
[01:36:46.779 --> 01:36:47.719]  It's amazing.
[01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:52.442]  So, InfoWorksStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:52.442 --> 01:36:55.224]  I took a bunch of it yesterday when I went home.
[01:36:55.224 --> 01:36:57.646]  I took like twice the recommended dose.
[01:36:57.646 --> 01:36:58.967]  My wife's like, are you drunk?
[01:36:58.967 --> 01:37:00.348]  I was like, no I haven't been drinking.
[01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:01.829]  She goes, you're in a really good mood.
[01:37:02.875 --> 01:37:04.597]  You're usually kind of grumpy by 10 o'clock at night.
[01:37:04.597 --> 01:37:06.078]  You're acting really silly.
[01:37:06.078 --> 01:37:07.759]  And I'm just telling you, it's the happy.
[01:37:07.759 --> 01:37:09.801]  So, everybody's physiology is different.
[01:37:09.801 --> 01:37:11.323]  This is all Mother Nature stuff.
[01:37:11.323 --> 01:37:12.183]  It's how you fund us.
[01:37:12.183 --> 01:37:13.525]  Get t-shirts, get books.
[01:37:13.525 --> 01:37:15.206]  The globalists hate it when you fund us.
[01:37:15.206 --> 01:37:23.734]  Now we're going to go back to a very popular national comedian, Owen Benjamin, who's one of the most banned comedians out there, because he has a line in the sand.
[01:37:23.734 --> 01:37:27.957]  And I want to get his take on where he thinks all this ends with the polls I'm going to get to in a moment showing.
[01:37:28.823 --> 01:37:32.845]  Huge surges for Republicans in battleground states.
[01:37:32.845 --> 01:37:34.626]  But the Democrats just can't help themselves.
[01:37:34.626 --> 01:37:37.867]  They have to execute the corrupt power they have.
[01:37:37.867 --> 01:37:38.887]  And they just can't help it.
[01:37:38.887 --> 01:37:40.328]  They can't think a few moves ahead.
[01:37:40.328 --> 01:37:44.630]  But here's Mitch McConnell, who's been the establishment's buddy.
[01:37:44.630 --> 01:37:47.031]  He's getting hounded, called a rapist at airports.
[01:37:47.031 --> 01:37:47.971]  Everybody else is.
[01:37:47.971 --> 01:37:52.033]  You know, when I hound somebody at an airport, I'm like, hey, why don't you move to Venezuela?
[01:37:52.033 --> 01:37:53.634]  Communism's so good, Bernie Sanders.
[01:37:53.634 --> 01:37:55.155]  And everybody goes, oh, he's so mean to him.
[01:37:55.155 --> 01:37:55.855]  I was very polite.
[01:37:57.486 --> 01:37:58.866]  They're calling him a rapist.
[01:37:58.866 --> 01:38:00.607]  Rape, rape, rape, rape.
[01:38:00.607 --> 01:38:03.228]  Chasing him around, the media's like, this is a really good thing.
[01:38:03.228 --> 01:38:06.008]  So here's Mitch McConnell this morning.
[01:38:06.008 --> 01:38:12.630]  Then the far left tried to bully and intimidate members of this body.
[01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:17.171]  Republican United States senators.
[01:38:17.171 --> 01:38:22.533]  They've tried to bully and intimidate us.
[01:38:22.533 --> 01:38:25.794]  One of our colleagues and his family were effectively run out of a restaurant.
[01:38:26.505 --> 01:38:30.108]  In recent days by these people.
[01:38:30.108 --> 01:38:36.993]  Another reported having protesters physically block his car door.
[01:38:36.993 --> 01:38:45.779]  And some have seen organized far left protesters camp out at their homes.
[01:38:45.779 --> 01:38:49.101]  I'm not suggesting we're the victims here, Mr. President.
[01:38:49.101 --> 01:38:52.604]  But I want to make it clear to these people who are chasing my members around the hall here.
[01:38:54.301 --> 01:38:57.502]  Or harassing them at the airports, or going to their homes.
[01:38:57.502 --> 01:38:59.782]  We're not being intimidated by these people.
[01:38:59.782 --> 01:39:09.184]  There is no chance in the world they're going to scare us out of doing our duty.
[01:39:09.184 --> 01:39:14.765]  I don't care how many members they chase, how many people they harass here in the halls.
[01:39:14.765 --> 01:39:19.006]  I want to make one thing perfectly clear, we will not be intimidated by these people.
[01:39:23.837 --> 01:39:38.687]  This is all part of the organized effort to delay, obstruct, and intimidate, including those of us who will be voting this week.
[01:39:55.179 --> 01:40:04.690]  There's a known admitted sexual predator who's settled a bunch of rape cases and flies around on pedophile aircraft with Bill Cosby who is creepy and weird and giving women lewds and getting them drunk.
[01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:06.352]  They're coming to his house.
[01:40:06.352 --> 01:40:09.375]  I think there's some lynch mob going on here and I'm not just defending him.
[01:40:09.375 --> 01:40:10.577]  He's a conservative black guy.
[01:40:10.577 --> 01:40:11.618]  I mean, I'm not defending him.
[01:40:12.619 --> 01:40:13.821]  You know, the jury found him guilty.
[01:40:13.821 --> 01:40:14.762]  Okay.
[01:40:14.762 --> 01:40:16.424]  But I still have some questions.
[01:40:16.424 --> 01:40:18.167]  But Kavanaugh, there's no history of this.
[01:40:18.167 --> 01:40:19.488]  He's not on pedophile airplanes.
[01:40:19.488 --> 01:40:21.051]  He's not settling rape cases.
[01:40:21.051 --> 01:40:23.915]  And then the Democrats defended him over the years.
[01:40:23.915 --> 01:40:26.358]  So that's why this is such a disgusting piece from the ACLU.
[01:40:26.358 --> 01:40:26.658]  Here it is.
[01:40:27.782 --> 01:40:29.123]  We've seen this before.
[01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.225]  Denials from powerful men.
[01:40:31.225 --> 01:40:35.548]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[01:40:35.548 --> 01:40:37.650]  I've never seen anything like this.
[01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:43.274]  I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.
[01:40:43.274 --> 01:40:45.395]  America is watching.
[01:40:45.395 --> 01:40:50.359]  And as we choose a lifetime seat on our highest court, integrity matters.
[01:40:50.359 --> 01:40:52.941]  And we cannot have any doubt.
[01:40:52.941 --> 01:40:56.564]  Senator Gardner opposed the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:16.911]  So, the ACLU is now against due process and shows a convicted sex abuser, basically a rapist, that's what he's convicted of, Bill Cosby, and then a guy the Democrats defended who's settled rape cases and hangs around with known pedophiles on airplanes with little kids.
[01:41:16.911 --> 01:41:18.051]  And so now that's Kavanaugh.
[01:41:18.051 --> 01:41:23.555]  So because these guys did something wrong, they're now not just for due process, Owen Benjamin,
[01:41:24.548 --> 01:41:35.438]  They are now actually saying if another man ever did something, it's like saying if a black man did something wrong, all black men are guilty, or if a white man did it, all white men.
[01:41:35.438 --> 01:41:39.882]  This is the most bigoted, backwards, authoritarian thing I've ever heard of.
[01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:43.403]  Yeah, I mean, they think in demographics.
[01:41:43.403 --> 01:41:45.624]  That's how they think.
[01:41:45.624 --> 01:41:50.628]  They put you in a category and then you have collective guilt that you have nothing to do with.
[01:41:50.628 --> 01:41:55.172]  The good news is, though, the silver lining is it's going to just iron out.
[01:41:55.172 --> 01:41:57.113]  It's going to get rid of the middle.
[01:41:57.113 --> 01:41:57.914]  I call them the zebras.
[01:41:58.394 --> 01:42:03.118]  Because zebras are striped because, uh, the stripes don't look like the Serengeti.
[01:42:03.118 --> 01:42:05.660]  They're striped so they can fit in with other zebras.
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:08.502]  So that's why they stay in a pack.
[01:42:08.502 --> 01:42:11.084]  If you just mark a zebra, a lion will immediately kill him.
[01:42:11.084 --> 01:42:14.527]  So that's why there's millions of Americans that I call zebras that are just kind of in the middle.
[01:42:14.527 --> 01:42:18.370]  They're like, they think, like, my grandfather was a lead miner and a Democrat.
[01:42:18.370 --> 01:42:20.132]  Like, that Democratic Party is gone.
[01:42:20.953 --> 01:42:30.202]  And this event will make people, this is a lie in the sand, where if someone now tells me they're on the left, I'm like, you know what they did to Kavanaugh.
[01:42:30.202 --> 01:42:34.006]  You know that they're ruining good men with power acquisition.
[01:42:34.006 --> 01:42:36.529]  It's like, you're not, you can't just tow that lie anymore.
[01:42:36.529 --> 01:42:39.652]  You have to make a stance with truth or a stance against it.
[01:42:39.652 --> 01:42:40.152]  That's right.
[01:42:40.152 --> 01:42:41.394]  It's the wheat from the chaff.
[01:42:42.338 --> 01:42:43.459]  We're making a decision right now.
[01:42:43.459 --> 01:42:47.502]  We're going to come back and get your prediction for the future and more straight ahead in the next hour.
[01:42:47.502 --> 01:42:51.404]  We're going to take some calls and we've got a special guest in studio.
[01:42:51.404 --> 01:42:51.765]  Stay with us.
[01:42:57.342 --> 01:42:57.362]  X2.
[01:43:27.942 --> 01:43:33.084]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[01:43:33.084 --> 01:43:34.825]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:43:34.825 --> 01:43:36.065]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:43:36.065 --> 01:43:38.026]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[01:43:38.026 --> 01:43:40.406]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:43:40.406 --> 01:43:41.887]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[01:43:41.887 --> 01:43:45.708]  There's viable shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[01:43:45.708 --> 01:43:47.409]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[01:43:47.409 --> 01:43:50.390]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWareStore.com.

[01:45:03.112 --> 01:45:11.795]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:45:11.795 --> 01:45:13.736]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:45:13.736 --> 01:45:17.217]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:45:17.217 --> 01:45:19.838]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:45:19.838 --> 01:45:22.139]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:45:22.139 --> 01:45:29.082]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,

[01:45:43.506 --> 01:45:50.668]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:45:50.668 --> 01:45:54.349]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[01:45:54.349 --> 01:45:55.910]  This is InfoWars' Darkness Howard.
[01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:56.770]  We need your support.
[01:45:56.770 --> 01:45:57.491]  I'm counting on you.
[01:45:57.491 --> 01:46:04.093]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:46:05.186 --> 01:46:08.969]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:46:08.969 --> 01:46:17.395]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:46:17.395 --> 01:46:22.278]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:46:22.278 --> 01:46:23.739]  You are the info war.
[01:46:23.739 --> 01:46:27.262]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:46:27.942 --> 01:46:39.326]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:46:39.326 --> 01:46:47.289]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:47.289 --> 01:46:54.332]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:54.332 --> 01:46:57.073]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:47:00.791 --> 01:47:19.567]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.567 --> 01:47:26.193]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:34.351 --> 01:47:44.761]  Owen Benjamin is our guest and we are just watching the insane spectacle of
[01:47:53.874 --> 01:48:09.037]  Just weaponized media, and none of the stories adding up, and no witnesses, and people saying, I don't fly on airplanes, I'm scared, and they're all over the world, and oh, I don't know anything about polygraphs, and they advise people how to pass them, and it's like, where does it go from here?
[01:48:09.037 --> 01:48:17.699]  Where does it go with the corporate media trying to weaponize men and women against each other, and it's in the WikiLeaks how they want race war, and then, I've got a clip we'll play in a moment, you know,
[01:48:18.539 --> 01:48:25.423]  Kanye West is talking to some nobody TMZ reporter, and they tell him, take that off your head.
[01:48:25.423 --> 01:48:26.424]  Like he's a slave.
[01:48:26.424 --> 01:48:28.025]  I don't say that because he's black.
[01:48:28.025 --> 01:48:31.387]  I mean, it's like, I'm saying make America great again.
[01:48:31.387 --> 01:48:37.550]  The cult-like control over corporate media has just become insane.
[01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:40.232]  So Owen Benjamin, where do you think all this ends?
[01:48:41.596 --> 01:48:46.038]  Well, I think we're seeing the sleeping giant of American patriotism waking up, finally.
[01:48:46.038 --> 01:48:52.081]  And I think the future's bright for people that go indie and just do it family style and just...
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:53.841]  Keep it going.
[01:48:53.841 --> 01:48:56.183]  I just self-produced a special.
[01:48:56.183 --> 01:48:58.705]  You can get it at HugePianist.com.
[01:48:58.705 --> 01:49:07.813]  Because if Netflix won't have me anymore, or Comedy Central, that I've done two specials with, because Susan Rice is on the board of Netflix, it's like, that's cool.
[01:49:07.813 --> 01:49:08.975]  We still have America.
[01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:12.998]  So I shot my own, and just put it up, and people can enjoy it.
[01:49:12.998 --> 01:49:14.560]  Just like you doing independent news.
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:20.202]  And that's what gets me going every day, is the puzzle of it.
[01:49:20.202 --> 01:49:22.843]  Like, how do we get through these monsters?
[01:49:22.843 --> 01:49:32.568]  And I think they've revealed themselves so intensely now that they can't hide behind actual changes that you might think need to be made in society.
[01:49:32.568 --> 01:49:35.709]  Like, they got everything they asked for, plus way more.
[01:49:36.289 --> 01:49:37.971]  And now they're just going for socialism.
[01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:41.576]  So I still think it's the same as what I told you last time.
[01:49:41.576 --> 01:49:46.882]  I think that there's just going to continuously be a giant cultural divide in America.
[01:49:46.882 --> 01:49:50.647]  And I think that people are just going to keep moving towards the right.
[01:49:50.647 --> 01:49:53.170]  That's why they're going to keep trying to import leftist votes.
[01:49:55.373 --> 01:50:03.257]  Well, you're right, and again, you read about times in history where groups of people just doing horribly evil things, and you think, how'd they do that?
[01:50:03.257 --> 01:50:13.502]  They just get wound up, and a lot of times it's a lenient, powerful system or dynasty that liberalizes, and empowers the average person, and then builds up people.
[01:50:13.502 --> 01:50:21.506]  But then, the corrupt kind of sneak in, and they get control, and then we're tolerant of corruption, and then the corruption isn't tolerant of us.
[01:50:22.483 --> 01:50:47.274]  Yeah, and the corruption starts with the individual, and I'm a big history guy, and you saw it with Rome, where it starts with the individual that forgets about their nation and their family, and religion, and right and wrong, and they just start eating all day, and stuffing their faces, and importing slaves, and, you know, getting the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths.
[01:50:47.894 --> 01:50:55.019]  Attila the Hun, all these guys, they were already just coming in because there wasn't good border security in Rome because they just kept raising taxes.
[01:50:55.683 --> 01:51:07.511]  It's a story as old as time, but I have faith that America will fight it with what we have, because we still are a Christian nation, and we just don't hear about it in the media.
[01:51:07.511 --> 01:51:13.736]  That's the smartest thing the left ever did, is they put all the kids in debt from college, and they just took over the flow of information.
[01:51:13.736 --> 01:51:20.921]  That's why a small amount of them can make everyone feel like the world's gone crazy, but as a touring comic, I get to see that people are still good.
[01:51:23.015 --> 01:51:24.296]  At least they're still fighting.
[01:51:24.296 --> 01:51:25.336]  No, you're right.
[01:51:25.336 --> 01:51:28.058]  And what are they going to do if they lose the midterms?
[01:51:28.058 --> 01:51:32.821]  Which I think, unless their election fraud is massive... They're going to lose the midterms.
[01:51:32.821 --> 01:51:34.963]  We have a clip of Newt Gingrich saying that, too.
[01:51:34.963 --> 01:51:36.524]  We're going to play, too.
[01:51:36.524 --> 01:51:39.325]  So what do they do at that point?
[01:51:39.325 --> 01:51:40.286]  Just keep escalating.
[01:51:40.286 --> 01:51:41.987]  Because a liar never comes clean.
[01:51:41.987 --> 01:51:47.390]  Someone like Hillary Clinton, you can see... And we've all known liars in our life, like pathological liars.
[01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:49.532]  Not a white lie that you feel bad about and come clean.
[01:51:50.581 --> 01:51:52.722]  They only add to the lie.
[01:51:52.722 --> 01:51:59.625]  And they will just add to the lie and add to the lie until it just becomes just a crazy person in a corner.
[01:51:59.625 --> 01:52:04.708]  And they don't have as much fundamental power in America as they think.
[01:52:04.708 --> 01:52:08.910]  Our military, our police, all of our food.
[01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:11.031]  None of this is coming from leftists.
[01:52:11.031 --> 01:52:13.572]  They have the wizard spells.
[01:52:13.572 --> 01:52:15.593]  They're changing the definition of words.
[01:52:15.593 --> 01:52:16.814]  And now they're up to rapists.
[01:52:16.814 --> 01:52:19.035]  Because I was called a Nazi and a white supremacist.
[01:52:19.475 --> 01:52:22.516]  And I was like, how is this possible to use such hyperbole?
[01:52:22.516 --> 01:52:23.536]  This is insane.
[01:52:23.536 --> 01:52:24.877]  What words are left?
[01:52:24.877 --> 01:52:26.497]  And now what's left is rapist.
[01:52:26.497 --> 01:52:29.779]  They would call us pedophiles, but they hold that dear.
[01:52:29.779 --> 01:52:31.639]  They think there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:52:31.639 --> 01:52:33.740]  So now they're calling everybody a rapist.
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:38.181]  They sound like they're on PCP.
[01:52:38.181 --> 01:52:48.525]  Owen Benjamin, I want to play, since we mentioned the clip of Kanye West, and then I've got some other clips, since you bring them up, that we're going to be getting to here.
[01:52:50.322 --> 01:52:57.111]  Here's Kanye West sitting at some outdoor restaurant with the TMZ people.
[01:52:57.111 --> 01:52:59.834]  And then there's the disrespect of this reporter.
[01:52:59.834 --> 01:53:01.216]  No one even knows who he is.
[01:53:01.216 --> 01:53:03.099]  Here's Kanye West, a trailblazer.
[01:53:04.369 --> 01:53:13.616]  And a guy who sold over a billion dollars of records, and a guy that just supports bringing America together, and then the disrespect, like they're talking to him like he's a dog.
[01:53:13.616 --> 01:53:20.561]  If I was sitting with some reporter and they said, take that hat off, I'd tell them, listen, why don't you get your crap and get the hell out of here?
[01:53:21.061 --> 01:53:36.920]  Just like Kanye said, I was bullied at Saturday Night Live, and they cut most of his comedy pieces, and most of his music pieces, they put comedy in over his music, and basically cut him from the show, because he wouldn't submit to them, and it's not even a scandal, when Kanye West
[01:53:38.188 --> 01:53:45.894]  Comes out and he plugs Alex Jones and Donald Trump as matrix breakers.
[01:53:45.894 --> 01:53:49.657]  Days later, they remove that from a whole bunch of newspapers.
[01:53:49.657 --> 01:53:56.162]  Think of the coordination of corporate news working together to say, we don't want this.
[01:53:56.162 --> 01:53:58.263]  Let's memory hold out of a bunch of newspapers.
[01:53:58.263 --> 01:54:00.885]  That is unbelievable.
[01:54:00.885 --> 01:54:01.146]  Yeah.
[01:54:01.146 --> 01:54:05.329]  And with Kanye, it's crazy because not only is he a massive
[01:54:06.058 --> 01:54:07.558]  He's a star.
[01:54:07.558 --> 01:54:09.199]  He's a clothing designer.
[01:54:09.199 --> 01:54:10.299]  He's married to Kim Kardashian.
[01:54:10.299 --> 01:54:12.040]  He's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:15.341]  He also has incredible amounts of street cred in the black community.
[01:54:15.341 --> 01:54:17.361]  He's from Chicago.
[01:54:17.361 --> 01:54:28.844]  His debut album, I think it was Graduation, he's rapping with metal in his mouth from an injury that just is falling out of his mouth in his first video.
[01:54:28.844 --> 01:54:34.826]  He was called a genius in Jay-Z albums because he produced all that, and they'll take it like that.
[01:54:35.768 --> 01:54:38.969]  You know, my picture is painted on the wall of the Hollywood Improv.
[01:54:38.969 --> 01:54:39.889]  I'm painted.
[01:54:39.889 --> 01:54:43.671]  An artist next to other great comedians painted me.
[01:54:43.671 --> 01:54:46.672]  And like that, they can unperson you.
[01:54:46.672 --> 01:54:50.433]  But the thing about actual alphas is they, it's okay.
[01:54:50.433 --> 01:54:53.494]  Like we'll get mad or we'll get like stressed.
[01:54:53.494 --> 01:54:59.556]  But I think sometimes conflict can either break a man or it can like hone you.
[01:54:59.556 --> 01:55:02.457]  And someone like you, someone like me, someone like Kanye West, it's like,
[01:55:03.986 --> 01:55:05.829]  Jordan Peterson's another great example.
[01:55:05.829 --> 01:55:15.344]  Just some, like, appearingly meek Canadian professor, and they just thought they could hammer him and bully him, and they just created a warrior out of that.
[01:55:15.344 --> 01:55:19.570]  And we're seeing more and more of that, where they don't realize that they can't break everybody.
[01:55:23.894 --> 01:55:30.783]  And now you've got mainline professors calling for murdering Kavanaugh, murdering Congress, cutting their testicles off, and the media's like, big deal.
[01:55:30.783 --> 01:55:33.867]  And then I say, Antifa's coming to your house to kill you.
[01:55:33.867 --> 01:55:37.032]  If you're a member of Congress, have your rifle ready by your bed.
[01:55:37.032 --> 01:55:37.973]  They don't even quote me.
[01:55:37.973 --> 01:55:39.996]  They just say, Jonestead used rifles to kill the media.
[01:55:41.131 --> 01:55:44.753]  Again, it's like they've just committed to pure lies.
[01:55:44.753 --> 01:55:48.695]  Oh yeah, well, they're now in the pathological state.
[01:55:48.695 --> 01:56:00.981]  And I've known people like this where, you know, whether it's somebody that's cheating on their girlfriend or boyfriend for a long period of time, they get to a point when they could just be like, it's nighttime outside.
[01:56:00.981 --> 01:56:05.363]  And I've known people my whole life like that to a degree where I learned how to deal with it.
[01:56:06.147 --> 01:56:07.488]  And you can't engage.
[01:56:07.488 --> 01:56:12.870]  It's almost like a crazy guy in the street's like, you know, my grandmother's in the orange juice on Mars.
[01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:15.831]  Like you can't be like, no, she's not.
[01:56:15.831 --> 01:56:23.594]  You literally just have to just grind past it and just and just hope that like shadows, they just keep going down.
[01:56:23.594 --> 01:56:25.074]  You know, we have to fight.
[01:56:25.074 --> 01:56:26.315]  We can't just do that.
[01:56:26.315 --> 01:56:31.617]  That whole conservative attitude where it's like they go low, we go high and ignore it and just keep giving up rights.
[01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:32.757]  We're not doing that.
[01:56:32.757 --> 01:56:33.478]  We got to fight.
[01:56:33.478 --> 01:56:34.358]  But at the same time,
[01:56:35.379 --> 01:56:41.945]  The best move is just family, you know, America, working hard, like, achieving things.
[01:56:41.945 --> 01:56:52.656]  Like, the things that make America great, which is free speech, the right to defend ourselves, like, those are the things that we hold tight and keep hammering and just letting the dead wood burn off us by these psychopaths.
[01:56:56.457 --> 01:56:58.779]  Owen Benjamin, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:56:58.779 --> 01:56:59.700]  I really appreciate the time.
[01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:00.460]  It was an honor.
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:01.081]  Honor, my friend.
[01:57:01.081 --> 01:57:01.441]  You bet.
[01:57:01.441 --> 01:57:02.022]  You bet.
[01:57:02.022 --> 01:57:05.284]  And, you know, the good news is humanity's waking up.
[01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:07.646]  People are getting out of this, this trance they're in.
[01:57:07.646 --> 01:57:12.990]  Because so many people from TV and radio and smartphones or whatever, they just, they don't have any memory.
[01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:15.272]  It's like they're conscious for like 10 seconds.
[01:57:15.272 --> 01:57:18.455]  And I've learned freedom is having a memory and an attention span.
[01:57:18.455 --> 01:57:18.735]  Yes, it is.
[01:57:18.735 --> 01:57:19.736]  Context.
[01:57:19.736 --> 01:57:20.216]  Context.
[01:57:20.216 --> 01:57:22.138]  My mom hates digital watches.
[01:57:22.138 --> 01:57:24.900]  She says you need to see where the hands are and where they bend.
[01:57:25.751 --> 01:57:31.316]  You know, it's like context is everything and not having moms in the home now is not letting kids know where we're from.
[01:57:31.316 --> 01:57:34.698]  I talked to people and 10 seconds later they don't remember a word I said.
[01:57:34.698 --> 01:57:35.439]  And it's scary.
[01:57:35.439 --> 01:57:37.180]  You're like, I just talked to you.
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:39.402]  And I talked to people today five times.
[01:57:39.402 --> 01:57:41.464]  They remember none of it.
[01:57:41.464 --> 01:57:42.064]  None of it.
[01:57:42.064 --> 01:57:43.125]  Hey, God bless you.
[01:57:43.125 --> 01:57:44.626]  Next hour coming up, Jam Pack.
[01:57:44.626 --> 01:57:45.027]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:55.658]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.658 --> 01:57:57.139]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.139 --> 01:58:01.843]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.843 --> 01:58:06.848]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:58:07.068 --> 01:58:27.220]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:31.704]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[01:58:31.704 --> 01:58:35.388]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[01:58:35.388 --> 01:58:40.392]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:58:40.392 --> 01:58:43.115]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:58:43.115 --> 01:58:45.557]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:48.123 --> 01:58:54.509]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:58:54.509 --> 01:58:57.732]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:58:57.732 --> 01:59:01.435]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:59:01.435 --> 01:59:06.139]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:06.139 --> 01:59:09.402]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.283 --> 01:59:21.287]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.287 --> 01:59:29.790]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:59:31.451 --> 01:59:33.292]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:12.762 --> 02:00:18.940]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:01:05.404 --> 02:01:07.145]  All right, we're back live, folks.
[02:01:07.145 --> 02:01:08.165]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:01:08.165 --> 02:01:26.812]  Coming up, we've got a very, very important video that I guess I'll introduce at that time, dealing with the fact that Trump is going to investigate, just like I told you he was going to investigate Big Tech, Trump is set to go after in a big way.
[02:01:27.918 --> 02:01:30.840]  Not just Silicon Valley, but these big mega banks in Silicon Valley.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:35.983]  They're trying to set up a cashless society, then penalize nationalists, conservatives, Christians, you name it.
[02:01:35.983 --> 02:01:37.964]  They are all big threats to humanity.
[02:01:37.964 --> 02:01:38.845]  He talked about that.
[02:01:38.845 --> 02:01:43.027]  He's going to fight globalists and other threats to humanity in a speech he gave.
[02:01:43.027 --> 02:01:55.835]  So, we're going to be going over all of that and we're going to be airing the podcast clips from the story on a website called infowars.com.
[02:01:58.627 --> 02:02:03.229]  Apple CEO denies colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
[02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:06.730]  Even though he bragged about it at the time, how they made the decision to collude.
[02:02:06.730 --> 02:02:11.472]  I've never even had a conversation about this with any tech company.
[02:02:11.472 --> 02:02:16.494]  So, get your ducks in a row when you run the slave factories in China.
[02:02:16.494 --> 02:02:20.215]  And how they all said that when you made the decision from your Sunday call, and then they did it.
[02:02:21.857 --> 02:02:24.939]  And then so it makes him feel powerful as a gulag owner.
[02:02:24.939 --> 02:02:36.909]  They always have this vice reporter that makes jokes about George Soros being a Nazi, and her eyes are like super far apart, and I'm sorry for her if she had fetal infant alcohol damage.
[02:02:36.909 --> 02:02:37.750]  I'm serious.
[02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:39.571]  It's like, that's what the globalists do.
[02:02:39.571 --> 02:02:46.337]  They like put some sad, you know, person that looks like they've got chromosomal damage on television to, uh,
[02:02:47.307 --> 02:02:50.908]  To sit there with Tim Cook so he feels powerful in their presence.
[02:02:50.908 --> 02:02:54.889]  So we're going to be looking at all of that too.
[02:02:54.889 --> 02:02:58.850]  Coming up here today.
[02:02:58.850 --> 02:03:00.491]  You know.
[02:03:00.491 --> 02:03:02.892]  I'm living in the real world as everybody knows.
[02:03:02.892 --> 02:03:05.052]  And I'm conscious.
[02:03:05.052 --> 02:03:06.353]  And I have a memory.
[02:03:06.353 --> 02:03:09.434]  And I almost sometimes think a memory is a curse.
[02:03:09.434 --> 02:03:13.975]  You know maybe that's why Christine Blasey Ford
[02:03:15.595 --> 02:03:19.456]  Works in DARPA funded programs to help erase memories and plant false ones.
[02:03:19.456 --> 02:03:22.537]  Maybe she thinks like that's her area of study because she wants to be happy.
[02:03:22.537 --> 02:03:24.378]  Like she thought, I can go to New Zealand.
[02:03:24.378 --> 02:03:26.078]  I can erase who I am.
[02:03:26.078 --> 02:03:27.338]  My students all hate me.
[02:03:27.338 --> 02:03:28.879]  I'm this huge liar.
[02:03:28.879 --> 02:03:30.739]  My ex-boyfriends hate me.
[02:03:30.739 --> 02:03:32.540]  My ex-husband hates me.
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.201]  You know, I'm running from myself.
[02:03:35.201 --> 02:03:38.061]  But I've never got on airplanes because I'm so scared.
[02:03:38.061 --> 02:03:42.083]  It just goes to the complete culture of fraud.
[02:03:42.083 --> 02:03:43.463]  So I shot a special report.
[02:03:45.066 --> 02:04:06.093]  That's titled, President Trump set to investigate banks, or President Trump is preparing to investigate bank discrimination, or President Trump is set to investigate banks discriminating against conservatives.
[02:04:06.093 --> 02:04:07.853]  That was the headline when I shot it last night.
[02:04:07.853 --> 02:04:09.874]  It was the headline this morning.
[02:04:09.874 --> 02:04:12.034]  It was the headline an hour ago.
[02:04:12.034 --> 02:04:13.955]  It was the headline 30 minutes ago.
[02:04:17.142 --> 02:04:19.707]  Let alone we heard her in a moment.
[02:04:19.707 --> 02:04:24.916]  And it's important stuff to you and your family because Revelations is a warning.
[02:04:24.916 --> 02:04:27.962]  You might not want to let this happen.
[02:04:27.962 --> 02:04:29.846]  You know, God lets us kind of choose our own adventure.
[02:04:31.345 --> 02:04:34.848]  And I think a lot of this cash flow system is already in place and the prophecy will be fulfilled.
[02:04:34.848 --> 02:04:39.311]  But how bad it's going to be, I think, is really up to us.
[02:04:39.311 --> 02:04:41.973]  So, we'll be back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:41.973 --> 02:04:43.634]  We're going to air this piece.
[02:04:43.634 --> 02:04:48.617]  It's very, very important and I suggest everybody pay attention to it.
[02:04:48.617 --> 02:04:49.538]  NewsWorks.com.
[02:04:49.538 --> 02:04:50.499]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:04:56.474 --> 02:05:03.620]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:15.969]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated Prebiotic Fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[02:05:16.690 --> 02:05:27.785]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[02:05:27.785 --> 02:05:34.553]  InfoWars Life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality, organic, and clinically studied ingredients.
[02:05:35.154 --> 02:05:49.810]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:05:49.810 --> 02:05:52.493]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:07.978 --> 02:06:16.826]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.826 --> 02:06:21.190]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:29.460]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:37.987]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[02:06:37.987 --> 02:06:49.456]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[02:06:49.456 --> 02:06:50.978]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[02:06:51.758 --> 02:07:07.711]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[02:07:07.711 --> 02:07:10.453]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[02:07:10.453 --> 02:07:16.839]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[02:07:19.488 --> 02:07:22.170]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:31.295]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:07:31.295 --> 02:07:37.258]  PayPal is creating a global monopoly over online purchases and sales.
[02:07:37.258 --> 02:07:42.521]  Can you imagine the abuse, the tyranny they can carry out if we don't say no to this system?
[02:07:43.404 --> 02:07:45.905]  Well, I think my lawsuit against them is going to save the world?
[02:07:45.905 --> 02:07:46.825]  No.
[02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:56.150]  It's meant to raise an alarm to you, to we the people, and to the President, who's already taken action against big tech and their censorship.
[02:07:56.150 --> 02:07:59.311]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are the modern Paul Revere.
[02:07:59.311 --> 02:08:01.392]  We are raising the alarm.
[02:08:01.392 --> 02:08:04.173]  And we are winning when we take action.
[02:08:04.173 --> 02:08:12.497]  Almost everybody overuses the Hitler-Nazi analogies, comparing things to contemporary developments in our society.
[02:08:15.652 --> 02:08:27.081]  Went after his political opposition, Jews and many other groups, and began to cut them out of banking, and out of commerce, and then out of being able to have shops on the streets.
[02:08:27.081 --> 02:08:27.861]  That started in 1933.
[02:08:27.861 --> 02:08:34.346]  By 1937, he had put the Jews and other groups into ghettos.
[02:08:34.346 --> 02:08:38.730]  And so, about a week ago, PayPal said, we've been with you 18 years.
[02:08:38.730 --> 02:08:40.531]  You've been with us 18 years.
[02:08:40.531 --> 02:08:43.033]  You sell books, videos, t-shirts, supplements.
[02:08:44.167 --> 02:08:48.910]  We're not saying you violated our terms of service.
[02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:57.156]  We're saying for moral reasons, because you're a horrible person, we're going to break off business with you.
[02:08:57.156 --> 02:09:04.641]  So let me be crystal clear about why I filed this lawsuit in San Francisco in PayPal's backyard.
[02:09:06.127 --> 02:09:09.329]  I did it to draw attention to what they're doing.
[02:09:09.329 --> 02:09:11.690]  I did it because it's the right thing to do.
[02:09:11.690 --> 02:09:18.713]  Because we have major banking institutions and Google and Apple moving to China, helping suppress their own population.
[02:09:18.713 --> 02:09:23.255]  We have Google executives and Apple executives going public warning of this.
[02:09:23.255 --> 02:09:30.379]  This is really a dangerous, draconian system where this global cashless society that surveils everything we do,
[02:09:31.806 --> 02:09:38.908]  Begins to persecute people for their political views and deny them access to the marketplace.
[02:09:38.908 --> 02:09:40.909]  It's very, very dangerous.
[02:09:40.909 --> 02:09:47.511]  And I'm doing this because the law firms surrounding the president are part of the swamp and they're scared to do it.
[02:09:47.511 --> 02:09:49.852]  But I'm not scared to do it.
[02:09:49.852 --> 02:09:53.413]  We are seeing real bonafide authoritarianism here.
[02:09:53.413 --> 02:09:57.134]  So that's my big message to Big Tech.
[02:09:57.134 --> 02:09:58.534]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:09:58.534 --> 02:10:00.875]  It's not even about winning this lawsuit.
[02:10:02.139 --> 02:10:07.704]  It's about drawing attention to what you're doing and making a stand.
[02:10:07.704 --> 02:10:10.746]  We filed this lawsuit last night and already today there's hundreds of articles.
[02:10:10.746 --> 02:10:15.450]  Alex Jones sues PayPal after Infowars banned for hate and intolerance.
[02:10:15.450 --> 02:10:17.132]  That's defamation on its face.
[02:10:18.593 --> 02:10:22.397]  Even if I was a racist, I deserve to be able to have banking.
[02:10:22.397 --> 02:10:31.468]  But I support Martin Luther King and the ideas of standing with people for their ideas and what they produce and who they are, not what color they are.
[02:10:31.468 --> 02:10:34.431]  Everyone knows that the KKK and the Nazis hate me.
[02:10:35.737 --> 02:10:46.564]  So that defamation of them defining me as hate and intolerance and blowing me out the political airlock so I can't even engage in commerce is incredibly dangerous.
[02:10:46.564 --> 02:10:47.304]  Here's another headline.
[02:10:47.304 --> 02:10:53.308]  Alex Jones files lawsuit trying to force PayPal to reinstate InfoWars account.
[02:10:53.308 --> 02:10:54.109]  What we're doing
[02:10:55.469 --> 02:11:08.154]  He's pointing out that after 18 years of doing business with us, you are attempting to rape our rights to access to the free market and defaming us at the same time with some nebulous term like hate.
[02:11:08.154 --> 02:11:11.175]  Alex Jones sues PayPal.
[02:11:11.175 --> 02:11:15.137]  PayPal sued over a block of Alex Jones Infowars.
[02:11:15.137 --> 02:11:17.598]  He goes on and on.
[02:11:17.598 --> 02:11:20.439]  And there's a final article of the Washington Post.
[02:11:22.626 --> 02:11:27.589]  It says, how Alex Jones is poisoning the antitrust debate.
[02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:31.171]  This was syndicated across the country today.
[02:11:31.171 --> 02:11:41.837]  You have over 90 big tech companies all in San Francisco, banning me on every platform you can imagine, even LinkedIn, saying I can't even say I'm available for hire.
[02:11:41.837 --> 02:11:46.360]  Telling me to go to my ghetto and starve to death and die.
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:49.002]  So let me give the arrogant SOBs,
[02:11:50.146 --> 02:12:01.530]  At the big tech companies, who make trillions of dollars and are all tax-exempt, and run the worst slave factories in China, in Google's case, or Apple's case.
[02:12:01.530 --> 02:12:05.851]  You won't be so arrogant soon, because humanity's waking up to what you've done.
[02:12:05.851 --> 02:12:10.952]  The inventor of the internet admits you're an authoritarian threat, and is developing systems to counter you.
[02:12:10.952 --> 02:12:13.453]  You thought humanity had submitted to your tyranny.
[02:12:13.453 --> 02:12:18.215]  We were asleep, and now all you've done is awaken the spirit of humanity.
[02:12:18.215 --> 02:12:18.995]  You've awakened her.
[02:12:19.901 --> 02:12:23.385]  I'm not being censored because I'm stupid or goofy or fake news.
[02:12:23.385 --> 02:12:27.829]  I'm being censored, like Tucker Carlson said, because I'm changing the world.
[02:12:27.829 --> 02:12:30.252]  Thanks to our viewers and our listeners who are taking action.
[02:12:30.871 --> 02:12:32.832]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:12:32.832 --> 02:12:34.753]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:34.753 --> 02:12:37.694]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:12:37.694 --> 02:12:38.534]  Alex Jones.
[02:12:38.534 --> 02:12:39.595]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:12:39.595 --> 02:12:42.696]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:42.696 --> 02:12:45.998]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:12:45.998 --> 02:12:47.959]  Alex Jones, the nut job radio guy.
[02:12:47.959 --> 02:12:49.559]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:12:49.559 --> 02:12:54.882]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[02:12:54.882 --> 02:12:56.002]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:12:56.002 --> 02:12:57.263]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:12:57.563 --> 02:12:58.524]  This isn't a game!
[02:12:58.524 --> 02:12:59.464]  Hate speech.
[02:12:59.464 --> 02:13:01.465]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[02:13:01.465 --> 02:13:05.848]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[02:13:05.848 --> 02:13:07.969]  1776 will commence again if you try to take...
[02:13:09.967 --> 02:13:11.948]  I don't want Batman to have a gun.
[02:13:11.948 --> 02:13:13.690]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:16.972]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[02:13:16.972 --> 02:13:19.633]  It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
[02:13:19.633 --> 02:13:21.915]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[02:13:21.915 --> 02:13:25.077]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[02:13:25.077 --> 02:13:27.899]  You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S.
[02:13:27.899 --> 02:13:32.682]  government, saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S.
[02:13:32.682 --> 02:13:33.702]  citizens.
[02:13:33.702 --> 02:13:35.444]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[02:13:35.444 --> 02:13:37.925]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:13:37.925 --> 02:13:39.066]  Batman is a threat to this country.
[02:13:39.346 --> 02:13:40.746]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:13:40.746 --> 02:13:42.107]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[02:13:42.107 --> 02:13:43.987]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:13:43.987 --> 02:13:45.828]  He's considered legitimate among the crazy.
[02:13:45.828 --> 02:13:52.010]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:53.450]  I'd love to see that.
[02:13:53.450 --> 02:13:55.490]  In uniform.
[02:13:55.490 --> 02:14:00.152]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[02:14:00.152 --> 02:14:00.772]  I like that guy.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:19.803]  We have gangsters running this country.
[02:14:19.803 --> 02:14:20.263]  Criminals!
[02:14:20.263 --> 02:14:20.824]  Gangsters!
[02:14:20.824 --> 02:14:24.007]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[02:14:26.475 --> 02:14:29.658]  We have a fog that has descended upon our entire nation.
[02:14:29.658 --> 02:14:31.519]  The globalists are going to blow stuff out of the land.
[02:14:31.519 --> 02:14:34.061]  Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[02:14:34.061 --> 02:14:39.806]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[02:14:39.806 --> 02:14:41.007]  This is as real as it gets.
[02:14:41.007 --> 02:14:44.690]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:14:44.690 --> 02:14:45.991]  To Matt, it's over for you.
[02:14:45.991 --> 02:14:48.453]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:14:48.453 --> 02:14:49.694]  You're out of there.
[02:14:49.694 --> 02:14:51.295]  You want it, baby?
[02:14:51.295 --> 02:14:52.857]  You're about to get it.
[02:14:59.542 --> 02:15:07.946]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[02:15:07.946 --> 02:15:12.888]  We met them at Concord Bridge, and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[02:15:12.888 --> 02:15:24.874]  InfoWars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[02:15:25.054 --> 02:15:28.376]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[02:15:28.376 --> 02:15:33.440]  No, Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:43.467]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[02:15:43.467 --> 02:15:46.309]  These people are of the devil.
[02:15:46.309 --> 02:15:48.071]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[02:15:48.071 --> 02:15:49.992]  Rave, hell, and the panic.
[02:15:49.992 --> 02:15:53.755]  We'll be back with Apple Tim Cook lying through his filthy rodent face.
[02:15:55.296 --> 02:16:01.981]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we're proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[02:16:56.563 --> 02:17:01.945]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.

[02:17:25.219 --> 02:17:26.440]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.363]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.363 --> 02:17:31.884]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:31.884 --> 02:17:34.847]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:34.847 --> 02:17:40.411]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:17:44.554 --> 02:17:46.776]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:19:59.298 --> 02:20:01.905]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:10.213 --> 02:20:10.733]  He's a tough guy.
[02:20:10.733 --> 02:20:12.315]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[02:20:12.315 --> 02:20:13.996]  He's a punk.
[02:20:13.996 --> 02:20:15.037]  He's a dog.
[02:20:15.037 --> 02:20:16.558]  He's a pig.
[02:20:16.558 --> 02:20:18.199]  And he can suck my f***.
[02:20:18.199 --> 02:20:20.841]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[02:20:20.841 --> 02:20:24.924]  I'll meet him in a hotel room every motherf***ing day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[02:20:24.924 --> 02:20:26.645]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[02:20:26.645 --> 02:20:30.848]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, c*** sucker.
[02:20:39.824 --> 02:20:47.970]  Pointing what appears to be a water gun at the image of President Donald Trump projected on a whiteboard, art teacher Pale Modi has now been seen by countless viewers across the internet.
[02:20:47.970 --> 02:20:49.551]  Yes!
[02:20:49.551 --> 02:20:54.174]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:20:56.207 --> 02:21:02.849]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[02:21:02.849 --> 02:21:11.672]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[02:21:11.672 --> 02:21:17.913]  The rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
[02:21:17.913 --> 02:21:23.095]  They're involved in the coup, an active attempt to start a bloody civil war.
[02:21:37.496 --> 02:22:05.118]  Alright folks, so we're back live.
[02:22:06.377 --> 02:22:19.887]  Old CEO of Apple that owns the worst and runs the worst factories in China, and who pays zero global tax, and pays no tax in China, who's batted against America, but it's okay because he's gay.
[02:22:19.887 --> 02:22:22.809]  He prances around, so it's okay.
[02:22:22.809 --> 02:22:31.415]  Bloodthirsty, soulless vampire Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, denies colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
[02:22:31.415 --> 02:22:34.017]  I've never had any conversation about this with any
[02:22:35.083 --> 02:22:36.164]  Tech company.
[02:22:36.164 --> 02:22:43.608]  He told that to the wall-wide flounder from the pro-pedophilia Vice channel.
[02:22:43.608 --> 02:22:47.910]  They have a bunch of shows on Vice on HBO about how great pedophilia is.
[02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:49.772]  Just wait till they grab your kid out of the backyard.
[02:22:49.772 --> 02:22:51.573]  It's really great then.
[02:22:51.573 --> 02:22:54.914]  But Apple CEO denies colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
[02:22:54.914 --> 02:22:58.577]  I've never had any conversation about this with any tech company.
[02:22:58.577 --> 02:23:00.618]  Well, really, I can pull up
[02:23:01.584 --> 02:23:08.187]  Congressional hearings, I can pull up the New York Times, I can pull up the Washington Post, I can pull up BuzzFeed just three weeks ago.
[02:23:08.187 --> 02:23:18.752]  Tech giants meet in secret at Twitter to discuss how to handle the midterms.
[02:23:18.752 --> 02:23:21.873]  So there it is on screen for you right there.
[02:23:21.873 --> 02:23:22.793]  And they're so proud of it.
[02:23:22.793 --> 02:23:28.536]  And they all work in concert where Apple and Google and Facebook, when they banned me,
[02:23:29.775 --> 02:23:35.678]  They will all release giant articles written days before on the exact minute.
[02:23:35.678 --> 02:23:40.140]  AP, Reuters, USA Today, BuzzFeed, all of it will all be at 447!
[02:23:42.944 --> 02:23:44.665]  They all release the article.
[02:23:44.665 --> 02:23:46.407]  Every time, it's at the same minute.
[02:23:46.407 --> 02:23:49.470]  Maybe in the morning, maybe in the evening, but it's all the same minute.
[02:23:49.470 --> 02:23:52.032]  They all get together, and they all come up with their story.
[02:23:52.032 --> 02:23:59.358]  Racist, evil, Nazi, demon that hates America, you know, blah, blah, blah, and then they release the fraud in unison.
[02:23:59.358 --> 02:24:05.703]  Oh, but Tim Cook, he's never heard of this in his life.
[02:24:05.703 --> 02:24:07.145]  And he was being interviewed by the, uh,
[02:24:08.551 --> 02:24:12.676]  Globalists love to have someone that appears to be mentally deficient interview him, makes him feel more powerful.
[02:24:12.676 --> 02:24:15.860]  That's like a little, kind of like a deformed jester, you know, in the old days.
[02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:16.641]  That's what they always do.
[02:24:16.641 --> 02:24:24.791]  So they have this flounder that's been living in a nuclear weapons reactor cooling tank, interviewing him.
[02:24:25.845 --> 02:24:30.028]  Apple CEO colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
[02:24:30.028 --> 02:24:33.991]  I've never even had a conversation about this with any tech company.
[02:24:33.991 --> 02:24:37.854]  Oh yes, and Google and Facebook and all you, you don't censor anybody either.
[02:24:37.854 --> 02:24:41.977]  Even though Apple admits they've given all your Apple IDs to the Chinese Communist government.
[02:24:41.977 --> 02:24:46.580]  I mean, what a lying pig.
[02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:48.642]  So the article's up on Infowars.com.
[02:24:48.642 --> 02:24:50.363]  Hey, great headline, Apple CEO denies.
[02:24:50.363 --> 02:24:52.544]  How about Apple CEO lies through his teeth?
[02:24:53.533 --> 02:24:55.335]  Says, no colluding by tech giants.
[02:24:55.335 --> 02:24:56.136]  Yeah, right.
[02:24:56.136 --> 02:24:59.640]  Well, let's get that antitrust lawsuit going and let's get all your records.
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:02.082]  Just like Google says, oh, we don't censor.
[02:25:02.082 --> 02:25:05.887]  They just said the day after Hillary lost, we're going to make sure this never happens again.
[02:25:05.887 --> 02:25:11.873]  And it's in all the WikiLeaks.
[02:25:11.873 --> 02:25:12.534]  What a monster.
[02:25:15.734 --> 02:25:17.016]  So, let's go ahead.
[02:25:17.016 --> 02:25:22.023]  Tim Cook has helped censor in China, and Google helped censor in China, political dissidents.
[02:25:22.023 --> 02:25:26.990]  Let's go ahead and hear him sit there and tell you how much he's never colluded with anybody.
[02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.271]  Here it is.
[02:25:28.476 --> 02:25:30.958]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[02:25:30.958 --> 02:25:36.283]  What users want from us and what we've always provided them is a curated platform.
[02:25:36.283 --> 02:25:38.104]  We don't take a political stand.
[02:25:38.104 --> 02:25:40.446]  We're not leaning one way or the other.
[02:25:40.446 --> 02:25:45.671]  You can tell that from the stuff on the App Store and in podcasts, etc.
[02:25:45.671 --> 02:25:49.154]  You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
[02:25:49.690 --> 02:25:52.591]  But at what point were you like, okay, that's it, Alex Jones has to go?
[02:25:52.591 --> 02:26:06.473]  You know, I don't want to get into a singular kind of event, but I think there's enough there that reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate, that that should be all.
[02:26:06.473 --> 02:26:09.733]  Did you coordinate with other tech companies to kick off Alex Jones?
[02:26:09.733 --> 02:26:10.714]  No.
[02:26:10.714 --> 02:26:14.854]  I've never even had a conversation about this with any tech company.
[02:26:14.854 --> 02:26:15.014]  Why not?
[02:26:15.014 --> 02:26:18.495]  We make our decisions independently, and I think that's important.
[02:26:19.571 --> 02:26:24.295]  What a lying sack of crap.
[02:26:24.295 --> 02:26:27.978]  They admitted that they had their little Sunday meeting and talked to other tech.
[02:26:27.978 --> 02:26:30.380]  That came out in the news at the time.
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:33.282]  And that he led the charge to do that.
[02:26:33.282 --> 02:26:34.303]  Oh, but he curates.
[02:26:34.303 --> 02:26:36.465]  Kind of like Hitler was curating in England.
[02:26:36.465 --> 02:26:37.326]  Or maybe the Communists.
[02:26:37.326 --> 02:26:38.907]  You know, Stalin was curating in Russia.
[02:26:38.907 --> 02:26:43.371]  You know, just curating.
[02:26:43.371 --> 02:26:48.415]  Oh, you're just curating in China with the worst factories over there and the suicide nets and the forced drugging.
[02:26:49.738 --> 02:26:52.480]  And trying to replace humans with robots.
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:56.923]  You're just curating when you defend the communist regime that sells political dissidents organs.
[02:26:56.923 --> 02:27:01.086]  Because you're the big, high and mighty Tim Cook!
[02:27:01.086 --> 02:27:02.727]  And you're not involved in anything political.
[02:27:02.727 --> 02:27:03.508]  Oh no!
[02:27:03.508 --> 02:27:11.153]  Apple doesn't give almost all its money to the Democratic Party and other socialist parties around the world while you're tax exempt and big, rich, trillionaire pigs.
[02:27:11.153 --> 02:27:12.754]  Your company.
[02:27:12.754 --> 02:27:17.678]  You're a total, virtue-signaling, gigantic, galactic-sized fraud.
[02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:22.832]  And you think you've defeated humanity, but you haven't.
[02:27:22.832 --> 02:27:32.460]  And you think by demonizing me, you build the straw man for the first domino to take free speech and then shut everybody else down, but you have miserably failed.
[02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:34.962]  Now they're trying to take away our processing, and I've sued...
[02:27:37.335 --> 02:27:45.538]  PayPal over it, and I didn't sue PayPal because we need them as a process server, or as a group to process the orders.
[02:27:45.538 --> 02:27:52.600]  I did it because they're going to move on to all the others, which they've done, and it's going to be a cashless society like China, where if you're not a good little globalist, you can't buy or sell.
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:57.242]  So I did it for everybody to draw attention to the President, which I know is getting ready to take action.
[02:27:57.242 --> 02:28:02.584]  So that's what I did, was to point out what you're doing to conservatives and Christians and others.
[02:28:03.951 --> 02:28:05.113]  So they banned us on Apple.
[02:28:05.113 --> 02:28:08.460]  You can still get the Android app free at InfoWars.com forward slash app.

[02:28:55.421 --> 02:28:56.642]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.642 --> 02:29:00.564]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:02.105]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.105 --> 02:29:05.067]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.067 --> 02:29:10.630]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:11.830]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:14.752]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[02:32:59.222 --> 02:33:01.844]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.286 --> 02:33:18.430]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.430 --> 02:33:21.335]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:34.986 --> 02:33:41.831]  All right, I just went on during the break and I said to Tommy, I said, listen, you need to talk about yourself, okay?
[02:33:41.831 --> 02:33:43.553]  You can't get him to do it.
[02:33:43.553 --> 02:33:46.255]  And if they made a movie about Tommy Robinson,
[02:33:48.166 --> 02:33:52.510]  Because I remember hearing about him like 12 years ago, this guy exposing rape gangs, English Defense League.
[02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:53.210]  He's a racist.
[02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:53.691]  He wasn't.
[02:33:53.691 --> 02:33:55.272]  Then they brought in racists.
[02:33:55.272 --> 02:33:56.133]  He left the league.
[02:33:56.133 --> 02:33:57.935]  He works for the Sikhs and others.
[02:33:57.935 --> 02:33:58.835]  You don't have Sikhs.
[02:33:58.835 --> 02:33:59.796]  And I know the statistics.
[02:33:59.796 --> 02:34:01.658]  One of the lowest crime rates in the world.
[02:34:01.658 --> 02:34:05.821]  They got formed hundreds of years ago because the Islamists were trying to kill them in India.
[02:34:05.821 --> 02:34:07.403]  The Hindus, they're not doing anything.
[02:34:07.403 --> 02:34:09.705]  I mean, OK, Hindus are kind of like Texans.
[02:34:09.705 --> 02:34:11.987]  Maybe they don't pay their income tax, but that's about it.
[02:34:13.879 --> 02:34:16.960]  So yeah, but you know, it's not even about the genetics.
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:22.202]  Because a lot of these Arabs have similar genetics to Sikhs or people in India.
[02:34:22.202 --> 02:34:23.023]  It's the culture.
[02:34:23.023 --> 02:34:23.983]  It's what Muhammad did.
[02:34:23.983 --> 02:34:25.684]  Does that mean I want to have war with Islam?
[02:34:25.684 --> 02:34:26.184]  No.
[02:34:26.184 --> 02:34:27.824]  But they've got 1.8 billion people.
[02:34:27.824 --> 02:34:30.065]  They're about to be 3 billion in the middle of the next decade.
[02:34:30.065 --> 02:34:36.368]  The globalists have made their bet on them and this whole plan to repopulate Europe with Islamists and then we're supposed to just die.
[02:34:37.228 --> 02:34:38.289]  And give ourselves over.
[02:34:38.289 --> 02:34:41.693]  So, Tommy, I want to get back into what's happening, but you've already proven it.
[02:34:41.693 --> 02:34:46.679]  I know you just can't be stopped to warn about the girls being raped, the kidnapping, because you've got a bunch of children.
[02:34:46.679 --> 02:34:49.022]  And they've been threatened with ass attack.
[02:34:49.022 --> 02:34:49.883]  You don't want to get into that.
[02:34:49.883 --> 02:34:52.766]  But talk about just what you've been through.
[02:34:54.025 --> 02:35:04.589]  In like a five minute gestalt, how it began, the year in prison, taking your house, the three months, losing all the weight, them putting you by the mosque in the jail, them throwing feces on you.
[02:35:04.589 --> 02:35:07.950]  And then again, now you got a court date.
[02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:09.551]  I don't know what you can get into on air.
[02:35:09.551 --> 02:35:11.491]  I know the inside baseball.
[02:35:11.491 --> 02:35:14.152]  They're wanting you to say certain things that they might send you back.
[02:35:14.152 --> 02:35:17.294]  So I want you to be very careful here because the world's listening.
[02:35:17.294 --> 02:35:18.554]  They admire you.
[02:35:18.554 --> 02:35:20.695]  They support you because you are the real deal.
[02:35:21.255 --> 02:35:23.717]  But we need to focus on Tommy.
[02:35:23.717 --> 02:35:24.538]  Tommy.
[02:35:24.538 --> 02:35:25.379]  Tommy.
[02:35:25.379 --> 02:35:27.100]  Tommy Robinson online.
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:28.781]  Tommy Robinson dot online.
[02:35:28.781 --> 02:35:29.882]  Twitter, for now.
[02:35:29.882 --> 02:35:30.863]  Are they banned you there yet?
[02:35:30.863 --> 02:35:32.565]  T. Robinson, New Era?
[02:35:32.565 --> 02:35:33.165]  I'm gone, mate.
[02:35:33.165 --> 02:35:33.986]  I'm banned off Twitter.
[02:35:33.986 --> 02:35:35.227]  That's right, so we can't go there.
[02:35:35.227 --> 02:35:38.029]  Where are the best places to contact you first?
[02:35:38.029 --> 02:35:39.791]  Because everybody's going first.
[02:35:39.791 --> 02:35:41.032]  And talk about yourself.
[02:35:41.032 --> 02:35:42.953]  Talk about yourself.
[02:35:42.953 --> 02:35:48.218]  So, from when I first started activism, within the first
[02:35:49.105 --> 02:35:54.887]  Six months, my house, my parents' houses were raided by the police three times.
[02:35:54.887 --> 02:35:58.928]  This has become a common theme over the years that continues.
[02:35:58.928 --> 02:36:02.230]  Go back to the trial, what you were witnessing.
[02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:07.311]  So, we were holding demonstrations and we were highlighting these issues.
[02:36:07.311 --> 02:36:11.813]  Now, the same police force that just imprisoned me outside the court case in Leeds,
[02:36:12.549 --> 02:36:16.853]  When we first started, I'd organised a demonstration in that police force.
[02:36:16.853 --> 02:36:23.080]  South Yorkshire Police Force is the police force that's come out and been proven as hiding all of these problems.
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:29.086]  Now when I first come to their borough... In fact, didn't it turn out in a lot of departments some of the leading cops are involved in the pimping?
[02:36:30.602 --> 02:36:37.144]  Some of the leading cops, we've had a Muslim police officer who was actually killed in an accident, who was part of it.
[02:36:37.144 --> 02:36:46.387]  We've seen, in this South Yorkshire area, I organised a demonstration to come and talk about these issues, but at the time these issues were not exposed.
[02:36:47.193 --> 02:37:06.906]  And the police, as a result of that, arrested me at the airport, raided my wife's house with machine guns, raided my mum and dad's house, put me on false charges that meant I couldn't associate with the organisation I'd formed, my bail conditions made sure I couldn't enter their entire area.
[02:37:06.906 --> 02:37:10.668]  So they prevented me from holding a demonstration, they prevented me from talking about these issues.
[02:37:11.511 --> 02:37:16.974]  Um, once the date had gone past of our demonstration, they just dropped all the charges.
[02:37:16.974 --> 02:37:33.742]  I actually have it from 10 years ago, in black and white writing, from an independent police investigation, where I put in a complaint that the police accepted what they'd done was politically motivated, they accepted the reason they'd done it was to silence me, and they sent their police officers on training courses.
[02:37:33.742 --> 02:37:35.983]  Now... So you were politically persecuted.
[02:37:35.983 --> 02:37:40.545]  Fast forward to your year in prison, your three months, and now what you're facing, because you may be thrown back in.
[02:37:41.516 --> 02:37:45.797]  Yeah, fast forward to... So that would have been a common theme over 10 years.
[02:37:45.797 --> 02:37:53.359]  If we get to the most recent case... The most recent case, I went to the City of Leeds.
[02:37:53.359 --> 02:37:58.860]  In fact, I still have to be careful now because there's still condition on this case.
[02:37:58.860 --> 02:38:06.402]  Basically, when I went there, there's a court trial going on involving 31 people.
[02:38:06.402 --> 02:38:06.602]  Now,
[02:38:08.186 --> 02:38:16.250]  All the information I'm about to tell you now, which is the whole reason why I'm still arguing my innocence, all this information is in the public domain.
[02:38:16.250 --> 02:38:24.774]  Now when you read the law, the law clearly states a judge has no power to put reporting restrictions on any information that's already in the public domain.
[02:38:24.774 --> 02:38:29.996]  Now what we've witnessed on the last six or seven big Muslim rape trials,
[02:38:30.859 --> 02:38:35.763]  That these reporting restrictions are put in place at the very start.
[02:38:35.763 --> 02:38:40.447]  And they state that there can be no reporting on this case whatsoever.
[02:38:40.447 --> 02:38:42.209]  Okay?
[02:38:42.209 --> 02:38:54.659]  So then, if there was reporting, then you'd be getting the details in today of what the men said to the girls, the comments they made, and the horrific abuse that these children have suffered.
[02:38:54.659 --> 02:38:58.142]  Including, even Mainstream News admits, a lot of dead girls.
[02:38:59.540 --> 02:39:01.441]  Yeah, plenty of dead girls.
[02:39:01.441 --> 02:39:03.462]  Plenty of dead girls.
[02:39:03.462 --> 02:39:05.703]  Plenty of girls who have never been found.
[02:39:05.703 --> 02:39:07.464]  Their bodies have just never been found.
[02:39:07.464 --> 02:39:14.348]  Let's be clear, we're hearing about Brett Kavanaugh, with no witnesses, 36 years ago, jumping on a girl at a party.
[02:39:14.348 --> 02:39:20.051]  And the same scumbag leftist media here covers up all the crap going on here against women.
[02:39:20.051 --> 02:39:21.872]  And again, I'm sick of people claiming they care about women.
[02:39:21.872 --> 02:39:22.812]  I have a wife.
[02:39:22.812 --> 02:39:23.533]  I have three daughters.
[02:39:24.193 --> 02:39:34.661]  I particularly care about women as an instinctive level and it enrages me to watch the left and their obsession with abusing women and defending radical Islam.
[02:39:34.661 --> 02:39:38.824]  And their obsession with the Me Too movement.
[02:39:38.824 --> 02:39:45.630]  I hear so many comments about someone said something sexist or massive deals made out of the fact that someone made a comment.
[02:39:46.164 --> 02:39:57.814]  And I think we've got children dying, children missing, being raped by their thousands in every single town and city, and you're silent.
[02:39:57.814 --> 02:40:01.236]  And you're not just silent, but you actually go out of your way.
[02:40:01.236 --> 02:40:06.621]  Journalists in this country, not one of them have challenged these reporting restrictions.
[02:40:06.621 --> 02:40:12.886]  So these restrictions are put in place so you can have a trial that lasts two months and you will not hear anything.
[02:40:13.533 --> 02:40:19.318]  And then when the trial finishes, they'll lift the reporting restriction and you'll get one day of news.
[02:40:20.491 --> 02:40:23.032]  30 men have been convicted for raping young girls.
[02:40:23.032 --> 02:40:24.013]  That's it!
[02:40:24.013 --> 02:40:26.134]  You won't hear the details.
[02:40:26.134 --> 02:40:28.555]  You won't hear the ins and outs.
[02:40:28.555 --> 02:40:35.038]  Why does the left cover up for Islam from Sweden to England to the US and the mass raping and killing of women?
[02:40:35.038 --> 02:40:39.580]  The whole thing of radical Islam and its orthodoxy is enslaving women and they're subhuman.
[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:40.301]  That's a fact.
[02:40:40.301 --> 02:40:45.243]  Why is the left in love with the true satanic patriarchy?
[02:40:47.014 --> 02:41:00.245]  Well, many of the time, as we've heard from the previous journalists, who knew this was happening, Andrew Norfolk, he only acted when he saw the far right or the working class were making an issue out of it.
[02:41:00.245 --> 02:41:09.012]  I think many journalists despise us that much, despise the working class that much, despise their own country that much.
[02:41:09.651 --> 02:41:14.773]  And it depends, it depends on what newspapers you look into, for where the money comes from.
[02:41:14.773 --> 02:41:17.054]  If you look at the Daily Mirror, we've seen the Saudi influence.
[02:41:17.054 --> 02:41:18.754]  Sure, it's a sick form of cuckolding.
[02:41:18.754 --> 02:41:19.675]  It's like funny.
[02:41:19.675 --> 02:41:22.436]  The working class are getting their daughters sold into slavery by the Muslims.
[02:41:23.643 --> 02:41:25.264]  Well, they're certainly not.
[02:41:25.264 --> 02:41:26.465]  They're certainly not.
[02:41:26.465 --> 02:41:32.350]  What they actually do then is they run stories about how people are racist or extremist when they march over it.
[02:41:32.350 --> 02:41:33.972]  In fact- But now it's all come up.
[02:41:33.972 --> 02:41:35.713]  So let me ask you this.
[02:41:35.713 --> 02:41:37.375]  Now that it's all coming out, what are they going to do?
[02:41:37.375 --> 02:41:38.616]  Because they're on their heels.
[02:41:38.616 --> 02:41:40.097]  They want to kill you, my friend.
[02:41:40.097 --> 02:41:40.918]  You've got to stay alive.
[02:41:40.918 --> 02:41:42.359]  We'll talk about what happened in prison when we come back.
[02:41:42.359 --> 02:41:43.440]  But let me ask you this.
[02:41:47.071 --> 02:41:47.751]  What are they going to do?
[02:41:47.751 --> 02:41:50.352]  Because it does seem like they're more and more on their heels.
[02:41:50.352 --> 02:41:52.753]  Nationalists are getting voted in everywhere in Europe.
[02:41:52.753 --> 02:41:57.754]  Common sense, life force, self-preservation is coming back.
[02:41:57.754 --> 02:42:04.036]  Well, I said this, we had a day for freedom demonstration two months before I was arrested.
[02:42:04.036 --> 02:42:07.417]  And I asked that question, what are they going to do?
[02:42:07.417 --> 02:42:10.918]  Because I sit there now thinking, what are they going to do next?
[02:42:10.918 --> 02:42:12.379]  Because essentially,
[02:42:13.741 --> 02:42:23.329]  I think I'm in the wheeling seat and I've said that because everything I've tried to do for 10 years and I'd be willing to sacrifice my life to bring the change that's needed.
[02:42:24.068 --> 02:42:38.859]  Now, I think their intention has been many times to let me be killed or have me be killed, because that's... But now if that happens, after seeing the world response and the response in Britain and across the globe to my- Hold on, we gotta go to break.
[02:42:38.859 --> 02:42:39.459]  It's a hard break.
[02:42:39.459 --> 02:42:40.059]  I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[02:42:40.059 --> 02:42:42.721]  Come back with the incredible answer about a cliffhanger.
[02:42:42.721 --> 02:42:44.022]  This isn't Netflix.
[02:42:44.022 --> 02:42:44.783]  It isn't movies.
[02:42:44.783 --> 02:42:45.944]  This is a real hero.
[02:42:45.944 --> 02:42:47.124]  This is a guy they've tried to kill.
[02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:48.886]  This is a guy tortured in prison repeatedly.
[02:42:48.886 --> 02:42:50.207]  This is a guy that lost his house.
[02:42:50.207 --> 02:42:51.948]  His wife and children facing asthma attack.
[02:42:51.948 --> 02:42:53.389]  This is a real man right here.
[02:42:55.330 --> 02:43:03.721]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.721 --> 02:43:05.183]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.183 --> 02:43:09.890]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.890 --> 02:43:12.954]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:43:13.434 --> 02:43:15.116]  I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.116 --> 02:43:35.278]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:45:29.083 --> 02:45:30.804]  Ordered it six months ago.
[02:45:30.804 --> 02:45:31.804]  So I get the price down.
[02:45:31.804 --> 02:45:33.545]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:45:33.545 --> 02:45:34.785]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:45:34.785 --> 02:45:36.746]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[02:45:36.746 --> 02:45:39.126]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[02:45:39.126 --> 02:45:42.928]  In fact, right now, it is the last run of Survival Shield X2.

[02:47:10.109 --> 02:47:12.735]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:12.735 --> 02:47:17.946]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:47:41.258 --> 02:47:50.604]  Imagine a Hollywood movie where a guy 12 years ago is running a tanning salon in a little town in England and sees 10, 12, 13-year-old girls crying for mommy being put in cars.
[02:47:50.604 --> 02:47:54.366]  And then he talks to the fathers and mothers and they go, yeah, the police won't help us.
[02:47:54.366 --> 02:47:56.908]  Our daughters are sold to sex slavery.
[02:47:56.908 --> 02:48:02.672]  And then it comes out 9, 10 years after he talks about it, it's happening in every town.
[02:48:02.672 --> 02:48:04.433]  And in many areas, the police are involved.
[02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:08.201]  And it's just incredible.
[02:48:08.201 --> 02:48:12.443]  So now he's been put in prison for a year because he exposed it.
[02:48:12.443 --> 02:48:13.363]  They tried to kill him there.
[02:48:13.363 --> 02:48:16.924]  Now he's put in three months, loses 30-something pounds.
[02:48:16.924 --> 02:48:31.971]  Recap what you've gone through and the fact that a superior court judge said, and you're the expert on English law, you've been through it, correct me if I'm wrong, said, okay, you were convicted in one hour of covering the pedophile gang, which again,
[02:48:33.041 --> 02:48:36.265]  And then, so they struck that down, but still it's got to be re-heard.
[02:48:36.265 --> 02:48:38.427]  I don't know how much you're allowed to say on air.
[02:48:38.427 --> 02:48:41.771]  You told me a lot of it yesterday in that hour-long conversation we had.
[02:48:41.771 --> 02:48:46.156]  So how much, because people really care about you and they want to know what's going on.
[02:48:46.156 --> 02:48:50.801]  So recap what happened to you the three months in, and then the latest info coming up next week.
[02:48:51.761 --> 02:48:56.484]  So I went for a judge in Leeds where I was reported on this trial.
[02:48:56.484 --> 02:49:00.667]  I was not asked to plead guilty or not guilty.
[02:49:00.667 --> 02:49:03.549]  I was refused the opportunity to speak with my lawyers.
[02:49:03.549 --> 02:49:05.351]  The case was not adjourned.
[02:49:05.351 --> 02:49:11.035]  The judge didn't even tell me what I'd done or said that amounted to contempt.
[02:49:11.035 --> 02:49:13.116]  And he sentenced me to prison.
[02:49:13.116 --> 02:49:16.739]  And then, so it took them a matter of hours to send me to prison.
[02:49:17.392 --> 02:49:27.699]  But then it took me two months to get back before a judge to put across our case to say this is not how the British legal system should work.
[02:49:27.699 --> 02:49:43.549]  Thankfully, the highest court in the land, the Court of Appeal, agreed and they gave a scathing attack, a scathing report against the judge where they said my sentence was unlawful, everything about it was unlawful.
[02:49:43.549 --> 02:49:46.011]  Five major points were unlawful, but the point is
[02:49:46.846 --> 02:49:49.607]  They didn't have to retry me.
[02:49:49.607 --> 02:50:06.870]  There's another case of a gentleman called West where one thing, and one of the illegalities that the judge done on my case, he done five on my case, there was one illegal thing done in a gentleman called West's case and his conviction was quashed and there was no retrial.
[02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:10.870]  They've decided to retry me at the Old Bailey.
[02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:13.731]  Next Thursday I go to court at the Old Bailey in London
[02:50:14.508 --> 02:50:28.194]  The most senior court of our land, the court that deals with terrorism, high-profile murders, and I'm in court for talking on my iPhone about Muslim men who are raping children.
[02:50:28.194 --> 02:50:29.855]  That's why I'm in court.
[02:50:29.855 --> 02:50:31.936]  The court case had finished.
[02:50:31.936 --> 02:50:37.078]  I wasn't prejudiced in a trial because... And let's be clear, other news covered what you said and showed it.
[02:50:37.078 --> 02:50:38.319]  They didn't get in trouble.
[02:50:38.319 --> 02:50:41.040]  You were being persecuted because you are a world leader.
[02:50:42.265 --> 02:50:44.646]  Everything I said was in the public domain.
[02:50:44.646 --> 02:50:56.333]  In fact, if you look at what I said, the contempt charge, other journalists such as Rod Liddle have been stopped on contempt for breaching reporting restrictions.
[02:50:56.333 --> 02:50:58.434]  He got a £4,000 fine.
[02:50:58.434 --> 02:51:02.336]  I spoke to other journalists this week who collapsed the trial.
[02:51:02.336 --> 02:51:06.779]  There was 11 men on a murder trial and he collapsed the trial due to his reporting.
[02:51:07.339 --> 02:51:08.939]  And he didn't face any charges!
[02:51:08.939 --> 02:51:24.382]  No, we know you're being railroaded, so let's talk about what you're facing next week, and then what you're planning, because... Next week I face whether I walk into court, as I've been told, to apologize and plead guilty, so to meet the government halfway.
[02:51:24.382 --> 02:51:33.023]  To meet them midway, because at the minute it looks embarrassing for them, because they've been proven that they're persecuting me, they've been proven that their previous trial was unlawful and illegal.
[02:51:33.023 --> 02:51:36.284]  So it's whether I walk into court and do that, and then I get to go home,
[02:51:37.362 --> 02:51:42.265]  Or whether I walk in, which in fact I won't be doing anyway.
[02:51:42.265 --> 02:51:48.808]  I will walk into court with my head held up, and even if I walk out the front door there and then, my head's still held up.
[02:51:48.808 --> 02:51:55.051]  Or if I go to prison and I come out in a matter of months or however long, then I'll still walk out with my head held up.
[02:51:55.051 --> 02:52:03.295]  Because the only thing I take that I'm happy with about all this, obviously I'm concerned and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.
[02:52:03.875 --> 02:52:05.476]  I don't want to go back to prison.
[02:52:05.476 --> 02:52:09.259]  It has an adverse effect on my whole family, not just me.
[02:52:09.259 --> 02:52:10.520]  So let's be clear.
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:14.884]  Tommy Robinson jailed for exposing pedophile rings and being a hero and being proven right because he's dangerous.
[02:52:15.762 --> 02:52:16.922]  What makes you tick?
[02:52:16.922 --> 02:52:17.663]  I mean, I know me.
[02:52:17.663 --> 02:52:20.824]  I'm not looking to be put in prison or killed or attacked or boycotted.
[02:52:20.824 --> 02:52:22.605]  But I know I'm right.
[02:52:22.605 --> 02:52:24.645]  And so when they attack me, it has the opposite.
[02:52:24.645 --> 02:52:26.046]  I can be totally exhausted.
[02:52:26.046 --> 02:52:27.006]  And some bad news comes in.
[02:52:27.006 --> 02:52:29.547]  And suddenly I have like five hours of incredible energy.
[02:52:29.547 --> 02:52:35.269]  And it reminds me of growing up in Dallas, you know, when I was a nice, sweet little kid, like 10 years old, and bullies would beat me up.
[02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:37.330]  I'd come home, my dad said, well, you need to fight harder.
[02:52:37.330 --> 02:52:38.190]  And I was like 11 or 12.
[02:52:38.190 --> 02:52:42.072]  I put one of the bullies in the hospital next time he hit it, and I ended up getting in trouble.
[02:52:42.072 --> 02:52:42.912]  My dad got me out of it.
[02:52:42.912 --> 02:52:43.732]  He said, it's OK, son.
[02:52:43.732 --> 02:52:44.393]  We don't start fights.
[02:52:44.393 --> 02:52:44.793]  We finish them.
[02:52:45.434 --> 02:52:54.796]  What makes you at a gut level have not just the courage but the will to go out and do this and that totally scares the enemy?
[02:52:56.152 --> 02:53:03.715]  I put a lot of things... If I ever begin to feel sorry for myself, I'll put things into perspective.
[02:53:03.715 --> 02:53:08.257]  I just spent two and a half months in prison on solitary confinement, away from my children.
[02:53:08.257 --> 02:53:10.918]  So yes, that was not good.
[02:53:10.918 --> 02:53:12.579]  It hasn't been a good effect.
[02:53:12.579 --> 02:53:23.483]  But then I look at members of the British public who sign up for our armed forces, or the American armed forces, and they leave their children, they kiss them goodbye, and they go on six-month tours.
[02:53:24.715 --> 02:53:26.936]  So I just view everything.
[02:53:26.936 --> 02:53:27.876]  I may have been in jail.
[02:53:27.876 --> 02:53:29.297]  It may have been terrible.
[02:53:29.297 --> 02:53:31.037]  There wasn't bullets passing my head every day.
[02:53:31.037 --> 02:53:31.537]  No, you said it.
[02:53:31.537 --> 02:53:31.917]  That's it.
[02:53:31.917 --> 02:53:34.098]  This is a war for our own homelands.
[02:53:34.098 --> 02:53:36.539]  We are soldiers in the information war.
[02:53:36.539 --> 02:53:39.140]  And once we decide we're expendable, doesn't mean we want to die.
[02:53:39.140 --> 02:53:39.940]  We love life.
[02:53:39.940 --> 02:53:42.160]  But we have to decide we are expendable.
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:46.982]  And I think once you cross that road, many years ago, was it not empowering?
[02:53:46.982 --> 02:53:50.083]  When you made the decision, I'm going to go on to the end, whatever the cost is.
[02:53:51.417 --> 02:53:53.579]  It was empowering.
[02:53:53.579 --> 02:53:54.840]  I don't fear that.
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:55.960]  I don't fear that.
[02:53:55.960 --> 02:53:57.322]  And that's the truth.
[02:53:57.322 --> 02:54:00.224]  I generally don't fear that because I've accepted that.
[02:54:00.224 --> 02:54:12.333]  I've accepted that the inevitable outcome of this path, which I've chosen, I wrote a letter to my wife when I was in prison explaining all of this to say that I'm not in this position through anything other than choice.
[02:54:12.333 --> 02:54:14.074]  I know what I'm doing.
[02:54:14.074 --> 02:54:15.635]  I'm not a victim.
[02:54:15.635 --> 02:54:16.276]  I'm a target.
[02:54:17.458 --> 02:54:26.562]  Yeah, I'm not their victim, I'm their target, and I'm not gonna wallow in self-pity about a situation that is nothing in comparison to what many other people go through.
[02:54:26.562 --> 02:54:27.683]  Well, these little girls!
[02:54:27.683 --> 02:54:30.624]  I mean, any time I, in the middle of the night, wake up and go, what are you doing?
[02:54:30.624 --> 02:54:35.326]  I think about how the globalists are pedophiles, and how they hurt children, and God's just saying, do it!
[02:54:35.326 --> 02:54:36.186]  You claim you love me?
[02:54:36.186 --> 02:54:37.607]  Execute this operation!
[02:54:38.888 --> 02:54:45.133]  Yeah, and the other thing, the other judgment to make all the time is, are we morally right?
[02:54:45.133 --> 02:54:48.796]  And if I'm morally right, I'll do anything.
[02:54:48.796 --> 02:54:57.744]  I will go anywhere and I will not face or care about the consequences of the problems I'm talking about, if I'm morally right.
[02:54:57.744 --> 02:54:59.385]  And once you go past that,
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:12.848]  As a moral compass, what we're doing is trying to save the future of our culture, our children, our country, our history, a thousand years of history in this land that I'm sitting in, and thousands of men.
[02:55:12.848 --> 02:55:24.335]  If all I have to do for five minutes is see and think about the previous generations of what they gave and what they sacrificed, and to be honest, even what I'm doing is nothing!
[02:55:24.335 --> 02:55:26.276]  Or what I've been through is nothing!
[02:55:26.736 --> 02:55:35.924]  We are a generation of cowards, born in an era where, and I also take huge satisfaction that so many people have been brought off of the fence.
[02:55:35.924 --> 02:55:36.945]  They've watched what happened.
[02:55:36.945 --> 02:55:46.833]  This last arrest, I'd like to say a thank you to Judge Marson, who put me in prison, because he has red-pilled more people than anyone I've ever met.
[02:55:47.501 --> 02:55:50.644]  He's been the most successful in bringing people to our courts.
[02:55:50.644 --> 02:55:53.126]  So that's all I base it on, Alex.
[02:55:53.126 --> 02:55:55.468]  I'm sure with yourself, we're right.
[02:55:55.468 --> 02:55:57.089]  We're telling the truth.
[02:55:57.089 --> 02:55:58.711]  It's a moral battle.
[02:55:58.711 --> 02:56:01.633]  It's a battle that we can't afford to lose.
[02:56:01.633 --> 02:56:05.637]  And the consequences are really nothing in comparison to what many
[02:56:05.717 --> 02:56:07.097]  And now we need intelligence.
[02:56:07.097 --> 02:56:10.758]  We need to think our steps out because you're a major general in this fight.
[02:56:10.758 --> 02:56:11.999]  We're going to break two minutes, five minutes.
[02:56:11.999 --> 02:56:13.299]  I'm going to get back to your family.
[02:56:13.299 --> 02:56:14.059]  TommyRobinson.online.
[02:56:14.059 --> 02:56:15.960]  People need to support him.
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:17.080]  He's trying to develop a plan.
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:21.942]  We're trying to work with other folks to set up something so that he can really get out there and be protected when he does it.
[02:56:21.942 --> 02:56:23.042]  We'll be right back after break.
[02:56:23.042 --> 02:56:25.543]  I've got to plug or I can't finance this whole operation.
[02:56:26.583 --> 02:56:27.744]  I can't finance any of it.
[02:56:48.496 --> 02:56:55.400]  The Iodine Conspiracy and how they have all these... Alright folks, I aired that from a week ago because he had his hearing.
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:57.301]  Tens of thousands of people showed up.
[02:56:57.301 --> 02:56:59.082]  It was incredible footage.
[02:56:59.082 --> 02:57:02.884]  And then the judge punted until the 23rd of October.
[02:57:08.646 --> 02:57:10.107]  Where he may be sent back to prison.
[02:57:10.107 --> 02:57:11.267]  He's just such a patriot.
[02:57:11.267 --> 02:57:13.108]  I wanted to re-air that today.
[02:57:13.108 --> 02:57:17.090]  We are going to have the exclusive interview that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:57:17.090 --> 02:57:21.892]  Some of the excerpts and the report that is the interview with the leader of the restart operation.
[02:57:21.892 --> 02:57:24.813]  It's the main opposition and a good group in Iran.
[02:57:24.813 --> 02:57:26.174]  That's going to be tomorrow.
[02:57:26.174 --> 02:57:26.874]  So look for that.
[02:57:26.874 --> 02:57:30.676]  Roger Stone's got huge breaking news coming up right now.
[02:57:30.676 --> 02:57:32.496]  Plus this at Infowars.com.
[02:57:32.496 --> 02:57:33.117]  It just broke.
[02:57:33.817 --> 02:57:42.193]  Report, Blasey Ford best friend, who she reportedly helped learn how to do a lie detector test, who later denied it, is also a career FBI agent.
[02:57:42.193 --> 02:57:44.196]  I mean, this is all people right out of the swamp.

[02:58:46.016 --> 02:58:48.798]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:58:48.798 --> 02:58:55.063]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:58:55.063 --> 02:58:56.844]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:58:56.844 --> 02:59:03.389]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[02:59:03.629 --> 02:59:03.949]  I think so.
[02:59:21.377 --> 02:59:21.817]  I think so.
[02:59:48.777 --> 03:00:02.979]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.979 --> 03:00:11.981]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.981 --> 03:00:18.082]  Well, Roger Stone is taking over right now, but I've got to ride shotgun a little bit because wild horses can't drag me away.
[03:00:20.598 --> 03:00:31.309]  Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather, father, brother, brother-in-law were in some of the nastiest areas of the deep state CIA.
[03:00:31.309 --> 03:00:43.460]  Not the folks actually fighting in foreign lands, or battling communist China, or the Russians, or not people who actually do work, but the ruling class brain bug psychologist type, psychiatrist type.
[03:00:44.321 --> 03:00:46.362]  And Pecheneg's one of those, but he was the top one.
[03:00:46.362 --> 03:00:48.044]  He was in combat, so he's a good guy.
[03:00:48.044 --> 03:00:52.967]  And he'll tell you how horrible the whole analyst, you know, cultural engineer crew is.
[03:00:52.967 --> 03:00:53.968]  They're the cancer.
[03:00:53.968 --> 03:00:56.930]  I want to be clear about different groups and intelligence agencies.
[03:00:56.930 --> 03:00:59.892]  These people are the worst.
[03:00:59.892 --> 03:01:06.116]  And then we learn, oh, the FBI agent that tested her, former agent, gave her two questions.
[03:01:07.208 --> 03:01:09.831]  Anybody can look up a standard FBI profile test.
[03:01:09.831 --> 03:01:16.397]  There's generally 20 to 50 warm-up questions to get a reading.
[03:01:16.397 --> 03:01:17.098]  Where do you live?
[03:01:17.098 --> 03:01:17.758]  Where are you born?
[03:01:17.758 --> 03:01:18.499]  Who are your parents?
[03:01:18.499 --> 03:01:19.139]  Who's your husband?
[03:01:19.139 --> 03:01:20.180]  Who's your wife?
[03:01:20.180 --> 03:01:20.801]  What do you do?
[03:01:20.801 --> 03:01:22.643]  What's your favorite color?
[03:01:22.643 --> 03:01:24.104]  She was given two questions, period.
[03:01:24.104 --> 03:01:25.405]  That's not a lie detector test.
[03:01:25.405 --> 03:01:30.330]  It's like saying going to college one day is not a bachelor's degree.
[03:01:30.330 --> 03:01:32.072]  Going to college a month is not a master's.
[03:01:35.023 --> 03:01:52.697]  So then her friend came out, was all over the news this morning, and said, oh, oh no, she never coached me on polygraph like her old boyfriend said, who said she flew all over the world and was lying about being scared of open spaces or planes, which in her own accounts, she admits she traveled the whole world.
[03:01:52.697 --> 03:01:55.339]  She admitted that to Congress, but she can't fly to DC.
[03:01:55.339 --> 03:01:58.262]  And none of the witnesses said they saw what they saw.
[03:01:58.262 --> 03:01:59.883]  She said that's because they're sick.
[03:01:59.883 --> 03:02:00.944]  It's okay, they're sick.
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:05.781]  Talk about projection.
[03:02:05.781 --> 03:02:15.824]  So, Christine Ford's friend denies being helped on Polygraph, fires back at news claims, but nowhere in AP or Fox does it tell you this.
[03:02:15.824 --> 03:02:16.304]  Report!
[03:02:16.304 --> 03:02:20.025]  Blasey Ford's best friend also career FBI agent.
[03:02:20.025 --> 03:02:24.646]  Oh, you might want to mention that and a Democrat and all the rest of it.
[03:02:24.646 --> 03:02:30.988]  Jamie White, InfoWars.com.
[03:02:30.988 --> 03:02:31.128]  So,
[03:02:33.303 --> 03:02:37.125]  It just gets more and more ridiculous from here on out, doesn't it?
[03:02:37.125 --> 03:02:47.171]  In a letter released from Christine Blasey, Ford's ex-boyfriend, it was revealed that Ford helped lifelong friend Monica L. McLean pass the polygraph test.
[03:02:47.171 --> 03:02:51.033]  But who exactly is Monica McLean?
[03:02:51.033 --> 03:02:52.554]  Well, she's the owner of the McRib.
[03:02:52.554 --> 03:02:52.934]  No.
[03:02:52.934 --> 03:02:57.837]  In addition to being Ford's best friend, McLean also is a 24-year employee of the Department of Justice and FBI.
[03:02:59.053 --> 03:03:02.323]  From 92 to 2006, according to her LinkedIn profile.
[03:03:02.323 --> 03:03:05.012]  But none of the media wanted to point that out, did they?
[03:03:05.012 --> 03:03:05.252]  No.
[03:03:06.491 --> 03:03:11.654]  And of course her lawyer, Ford's lawyer, is the top swamp lawyer for McCabe and others.
[03:03:11.654 --> 03:03:19.638]  The ex-boyfriend describes Ford's relationship with McLean in a letter obtained by Fox News, telling how she helped McLean pass a polygraph test, which they make the FBI do all the time.
[03:03:19.638 --> 03:03:22.880]  Wonder why he'd know that if the story wasn't true.
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:25.061]  Wonder why he'd even have something like that.
[03:03:25.061 --> 03:03:26.902]  Of course he's telling the truth.
[03:03:26.902 --> 03:03:28.303]  Who would come up with that?
[03:03:28.303 --> 03:03:30.124]  That she had a friend help pass a polygraph.
[03:03:31.681 --> 03:03:39.671]  During some of the time we were dating, Dr. Ford lived with Monica McLean, who I understand to be her lifelong best friend.
[03:03:39.671 --> 03:03:47.521]  During that time, it was my understanding that McLean was preparing, was interviewing for jobs at the FBI and the U.S.
[03:03:47.521 --> 03:03:48.403]  Attorney's Office.
[03:03:49.226 --> 03:03:51.347]  Which is now confirmed.
[03:03:51.347 --> 03:03:57.632]  I witnessed Dr. Ford help McLean prepare for potential polygraph exam.
[03:03:57.632 --> 03:04:05.057]  Dr. Ford explained in detail what to expect, how polygraphs worked, and helped McLean become familiar with less nervous about the exam.
[03:04:05.057 --> 03:04:06.598]  Yeah, right.
[03:04:06.598 --> 03:04:11.061]  Dr. Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology.
[03:04:11.061 --> 03:04:13.863]  Very special background.
[03:04:13.863 --> 03:04:16.725]  Now you'd think her being a Democrat swamp creature,
[03:04:17.947 --> 03:04:18.989]  Play into this.
[03:04:18.989 --> 03:04:25.725]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[03:04:25.725 --> 03:04:25.865]  So.
[03:04:27.330 --> 03:04:29.272]  It just gets more insane.
[03:04:29.272 --> 03:04:36.598]  And then meanwhile, there's the article on Infowars.com of Tim Cook of Apple, who runs the big slave factories in China, but it's okay, he's gay.
[03:04:36.598 --> 03:04:40.282]  As long as he's gay, it's okay.
[03:04:40.282 --> 03:04:43.325]  Bragging about how they censored me and just how I deserved it.
[03:04:43.325 --> 03:04:45.226]  You know, I just deserved it.
[03:04:45.226 --> 03:04:53.534]  Because, you know, everyone knows there's the body of evidence like running slave factories, helping spy on the Chinese people, like you, a mass murderer, Tim Cook, by extension.
[03:04:54.335 --> 03:04:58.247]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:04:59.577 --> 03:05:08.260]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:05:08.260 --> 03:05:10.261]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:05:10.261 --> 03:05:13.702]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:05:13.702 --> 03:05:16.323]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:05:16.323 --> 03:05:18.604]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:05:18.604 --> 03:05:25.547]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:05:26.107 --> 03:05:35.891]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:05:35.891 --> 03:05:37.092]  We'll win.
[03:05:37.092 --> 03:05:39.913]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:05:39.913 --> 03:05:47.136]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:05:47.136 --> 03:05:50.838]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[03:05:50.838 --> 03:05:52.398]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.
[03:05:52.398 --> 03:05:53.079]  We need your support.
[03:05:53.079 --> 03:05:53.799]  I'm counting on you.
[03:05:59.611 --> 03:06:10.273]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:10.273 --> 03:06:17.554]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:17.554 --> 03:06:24.056]  Well, at this point, there's just too much news to even cover.
[03:06:24.056 --> 03:06:26.236]  I've been forced to file a lawsuit against PayPal.
[03:06:27.552 --> 03:06:36.161]  I have an 18-year relationship with them, and the reason I filed suit against them is to draw attention to what's happening.
[03:06:36.161 --> 03:06:42.187]  Whatever comes from it, their contract is toxic.
[03:06:42.187 --> 03:06:43.569]  You waive your rights.
[03:06:43.569 --> 03:06:48.714]  You shouldn't make sharecroppers waive all their rights for a chance to be employed by you.
[03:06:51.169 --> 03:06:57.454]  And, you know, they demonized me when they said I was a hate monger and an evil person when they banned me.
[03:06:57.454 --> 03:07:00.416]  So, you know, that's a form of defamation.
[03:07:00.416 --> 03:07:09.042]  And, you know, when you've got them working with third world dictators, you've got them working with the Nation of Islam, you've got them working with Hezbollah, you've got them working with CAIR.
[03:07:09.042 --> 03:07:09.883]  And by the way,
[03:07:10.945 --> 03:07:22.617]  I'm not Louis Farrakhan's enemy, and a lot of what Farrakhan says is taken out of context, and I've interviewed Farrakhan, and at certain levels I think Farrakhan's said some things that are true, a lot of things I disagree with.
[03:07:22.617 --> 03:07:25.159]  So I'm not calling for Farrakhan to be kicked off PayPal.
[03:07:25.159 --> 03:07:31.705]  It's that anybody that knows my show knows that I really like Martin Luther King.
[03:07:31.705 --> 03:07:33.647]  He was a great speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:07:34.967 --> 03:07:38.389]  And I really believe in what you stand for and what you do.
[03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:40.751]  If you're great at art, if you write a great book, I'm going to read your book.
[03:07:40.751 --> 03:07:42.292]  If you cook great food, I'm going to come to your restaurant.
[03:07:42.292 --> 03:07:45.734]  If you play great music, I'm going to go listen to you.
[03:07:45.734 --> 03:07:51.498]  I think there's women beautiful from every stripe of human, you know, community.
[03:07:51.498 --> 03:07:57.522]  And so that's where I stand.
[03:07:57.522 --> 03:08:00.984]  And I don't need to sit here and virtually signal all day that I'm not a Nazi, but let me tell you something.
[03:08:03.356 --> 03:08:12.221]  They've called reporters that work here white nationalists, because they covered Charlottesville.
[03:08:12.221 --> 03:08:23.847]  Charlottesville was led by a bunch of Democrat operatives, all of them, who a year before had worked for Hillary or Obama, and then all suddenly dressed up like Nazis, and they're all a bunch of... I mean, let's just say it.
[03:08:23.847 --> 03:08:31.611]  I'm not against them because they're gay, but they're a bunch of gay drama students and drama professors who
[03:08:34.517 --> 03:08:37.599]  You know, wanted to burn torches and go make Trump look bad.
[03:08:37.599 --> 03:08:38.880]  I mean, that's what it was.
[03:08:38.880 --> 03:08:41.883]  It was just a gay drama club out there dressed up like Nazis.
[03:08:41.883 --> 03:08:44.145]  And there's been so many cases of that.
[03:08:44.145 --> 03:08:47.928]  And then reporters go cover it and you get called white supremacists.
[03:08:47.928 --> 03:08:53.031]  And listen, I don't like white supremacists, but I don't like black supremacists, Hispanic supremacists, any of this.
[03:08:53.031 --> 03:08:59.817]  We've got videos on Infowars.com, I haven't even gotten to today, with the incredible Millie Weaver and the amazing Gavin Winship shot.
[03:09:02.830 --> 03:09:12.313]  Where there are Mexicans who are illegal aliens, they say they are, wearing Mexico soccer jerseys, saying F Trump, F America.
[03:09:12.313 --> 03:09:16.214]  There's a new video out, we need to believe it, we should air it towards the end of this hour.
[03:09:16.214 --> 03:09:17.615]  Just insanity.
[03:09:19.181 --> 03:09:26.126]  And then there's a guy who lost his daughter when a drunk illegal alien hit her going 100 miles an hour head-on with three of his own kids in the car.
[03:09:26.126 --> 03:09:27.186]  They didn't die.
[03:09:27.186 --> 03:09:28.007]  She did.
[03:09:28.007 --> 03:09:32.670]  And this racist, in my view, Hispanic lady is saying, F off, gringo.
[03:09:36.212 --> 03:09:40.593]  So, yeah, if I was walking down the street and I saw KKK everywhere, I'd be concerned.
[03:09:40.593 --> 03:09:49.576]  I walk around and I see large groups of whites trained to hate being white and screaming white people need to have their balls chopped off and kill Kavanaugh and kill the Republicans.
[03:09:49.576 --> 03:09:50.897]  You know, that's major professors.
[03:09:50.897 --> 03:09:51.997]  They're not getting in trouble.
[03:09:51.997 --> 03:09:59.780]  When you talk about KKK type crap, I'm seeing it from white professors and leftists radicalizing Hispanics and others.
[03:09:59.780 --> 03:10:03.941]  Where you show up in Tennessee at a Trump rally, maybe we should roll some of that as B-roll.
[03:10:05.182 --> 03:10:08.664]  Headline, father who lost daughter confronts illegals.
[03:10:08.664 --> 03:10:12.807]  And he just looks at him and says, I lost my daughter, and they get in his face.
[03:10:12.807 --> 03:10:15.288]  There's a guy from Argentina who's here legally.
[03:10:15.288 --> 03:10:18.890]  He's like, Jesus, just be here legally.
[03:10:18.890 --> 03:10:34.660]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, that's what we've gotten to in this country, where Alex Jones rails against big tech, bombshell PayPal bans InfoWars after lobbying by Soros-funded group, InfoWars files emergency injunction against PayPal in federal court,
[03:10:35.731 --> 03:10:38.272]  Really what I wanted to show was their headlines.
[03:10:38.272 --> 03:10:41.732]  Alex Jones says PayPal and InfoWars banned for hate and intolerance.
[03:10:41.732 --> 03:10:43.093]  This magic word.
[03:10:43.093 --> 03:10:46.593]  I think Tim Cook running Slave Factors in China is hating intolerance.
[03:10:46.593 --> 03:10:48.994]  I think them shutting down free speech is hating intolerance.
[03:10:48.994 --> 03:10:55.155]  But they just say these magic words and I'm blown out the airlock.
[03:10:55.155 --> 03:10:57.316]  So, they're the clear and present danger.
[03:10:57.316 --> 03:10:59.096]  What are we going to do about it?
[03:10:59.096 --> 03:11:01.636]  There's another article on InfoWars.com.
[03:11:01.636 --> 03:11:03.657]  If you pull it up.
[03:11:03.657 --> 03:11:04.277]  That's the latest.
[03:11:06.277 --> 03:11:16.224]  With folks that are so brainwashed while they're inside this country and so trained to hate this nation that they don't even know what planet they're on.
[03:11:16.224 --> 03:11:29.755]  Oh, they want to get here as soon as they can, but they want to turn it into the third world nation that they came from.
[03:11:29.755 --> 03:11:32.296]  Why do they fear Infowars?
[03:11:32.296 --> 03:11:35.519]  Because we talk about real issues.
[03:11:37.739 --> 03:11:39.320]  Because we break down the real facts.
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:44.883]  I don't care how long it takes, I'm going to pull up the article on Infowars.com.
[03:11:44.883 --> 03:11:48.504]  I tell you, Fox Insider puts bugs on your phone, man.
[03:11:48.504 --> 03:11:51.826]  Once I went there, it just keeps launching all this crazy-ass stuff.
[03:11:51.826 --> 03:11:53.767]  I'll sit here for five hours, I have to.
[03:11:53.767 --> 03:11:56.568]  If you go to Infowars.com, I'm just going to sit here for hours.
[03:11:56.568 --> 03:12:04.452]  You go to Infowars.com, and you come there, and there's just a whole other article by Millie Weaver right there below the top stories and featured.
[03:12:04.452 --> 03:12:05.193]  There it is.
[03:12:05.193 --> 03:12:07.314]  Anti-Trump protesters declare Mexico first.
[03:12:08.288 --> 03:12:11.008]  And they've got Mexican flags hanging on them.
[03:12:11.008 --> 03:12:11.749]  All this stuff.
[03:12:11.749 --> 03:12:13.709]  This is crazy town.
[03:12:13.709 --> 03:12:18.450]  And that's where all our reporters should be is at the Trump rallies.
[03:12:18.450 --> 03:12:19.470]  That's where we should really be.
[03:12:19.470 --> 03:12:22.630]  That's where I should really be is just out there on the streets.
[03:12:22.630 --> 03:12:37.073]  And that's why they try to do everything they can to kill our live feeds on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube so that we can't communicate with you so you can't see what the globalists have set up and what the globalists have done and what they've developed and what they have set up in this nation to bring us down.
[03:12:39.096 --> 03:12:42.620]  That's it.
[03:12:42.620 --> 03:12:47.124]  So I'm going to end this segment and let Roger Stone take over, but man, that's some powerful video.
[03:12:47.124 --> 03:12:49.707]  It might even make one of our shows today.
[03:12:49.707 --> 03:12:51.249]  It might even make it on the air today.
[03:12:51.249 --> 03:12:52.730]  Probably not, though.
[03:12:52.730 --> 03:12:58.256]  But Millie Weaver's on fire, and I salute her, and I thank her, and I really, really appreciate her.
[03:12:59.915 --> 03:13:01.917]  So, Roger's coming up in just a moment.
[03:13:01.917 --> 03:13:04.498]  If you don't support us, you know, we're suing PayPal.
[03:13:04.498 --> 03:13:06.020]  That's going to be expensive.
[03:13:06.020 --> 03:13:07.321]  We're battling Soros.
[03:13:07.321 --> 03:13:08.061]  And I'm not bitching.
[03:13:08.061 --> 03:13:10.183]  Hell, I'm here to kick their ass politically.
[03:13:10.183 --> 03:13:17.148]  But you might want to bet on the horse and you might want to fund the operation that's 110% in as hard as I can.
[03:13:17.148 --> 03:13:18.309]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:13:18.309 --> 03:13:19.710]  A lot of people don't have members anymore.
[03:13:19.710 --> 03:13:23.232]  A lot of people have already given up their brains to TV and culture.
[03:13:23.232 --> 03:13:27.235]  Whatever mesmerization thing they send through these damn phones doesn't work on me.
[03:13:27.235 --> 03:13:28.136]  It only pisses me off.
[03:13:30.740 --> 03:13:36.147]  I'm conscious, I'm aware, and I'm not going to let people that aid and abet mass murders like Tim Cook run my life.
[03:13:36.147 --> 03:13:40.754]  And I believe we will beat this sorry SOB and the rest of them, as long as you take action.
[03:13:40.754 --> 03:13:42.897]  But I need your hopes, I need your prayers, and I need your support.
[03:13:44.229 --> 03:13:45.930]  Tomorrow's the last day.
[03:13:45.930 --> 03:13:46.570]  Maybe even today.
[03:13:46.570 --> 03:13:46.850]  I don't know.
[03:13:46.850 --> 03:13:51.311]  I've got new specials coming out on Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic, 40% off.
[03:13:51.311 --> 03:13:53.952]  Secret 12, the amazing pure vitamin B12.
[03:13:53.952 --> 03:14:03.856]  Happy's, the new mood and stress relief system with a bunch of key concentrated herbs that are known to give you not a depressant, but a smooth, calm, confident gait.
[03:14:03.856 --> 03:14:04.976]  I should probably drink a whole bottle of this.
[03:14:05.316 --> 03:14:07.017]  Actually, don't do that, folks.
[03:14:07.017 --> 03:14:07.938]  Take the recommended amount.
[03:14:07.938 --> 03:14:09.779]  Consult your physicians before you take it.
[03:14:09.779 --> 03:14:20.085]  It's a little tongue-in-cheek comment, and I'm pretty wound up with the energetic level, 34 days out from this critical election, and just trying to get people out of the comas, out of the trances.
[03:14:20.085 --> 03:14:24.688]  Even people who think they're awake are in these trances with no memory.
[03:14:24.688 --> 03:14:30.231]  I witness it constantly, just no memory, even an hour before, and it's like a time warp, but it's okay.
[03:14:30.231 --> 03:14:33.894]  Those of us that have memory, it's a gift from God.
[03:14:34.775 --> 03:14:37.337]  Those of us that have consciousness, it's an amazing thing.
[03:14:37.337 --> 03:14:39.659]  So, please keep supporting the broadcast.
[03:14:39.659 --> 03:14:41.201]  Please keep getting the products.

[03:14:52.691 --> 03:14:59.416]  Things are definitely coming to a head and Trump's gonna have big meetings in the White House soon with the tech heads with a lot of his face.
[03:14:59.416 --> 03:15:00.397]  He'll give them an ultimatum.
[03:15:00.397 --> 03:15:03.799]  They'll crap all over him and then he'll take him to the woodshed like he's done China.
[03:15:03.799 --> 03:15:05.180]  That's how Trump works.
[03:15:05.180 --> 03:15:15.828]  It's through a process of giving people a chance and I know that Roger Stone's got a lot on that, a lot on Kavanaugh coming up for the next three segments straight ahead and then you're gonna have our great host, co-host with him.
[03:15:17.651 --> 03:15:32.211]  Troyer is so on fire coming up today in about 45 minutes so we're gonna go to break but without you buying the products we won't be here you know PayPal now we have an emergency injunction may be good for a few more days I don't know but people say fight back well I'm doing it you know
[03:15:32.631 --> 03:15:33.572]  People say, get rid of Hillary.
[03:15:33.572 --> 03:15:34.092]  I'm doing it.
[03:15:34.092 --> 03:15:35.273]  People say, Hillary for president?
[03:15:35.273 --> 03:15:36.154]  We're doing it!
[03:15:36.154 --> 03:15:39.076]  Of course, you know she'd come after me, right?
[03:15:39.076 --> 03:15:40.037]  So, we've done it now.
[03:15:40.037 --> 03:15:41.258]  So, we need your support.

[03:15:53.413 --> 03:15:55.293]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:16:22.850 --> 03:16:29.194]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.194 --> 03:16:32.236]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.236 --> 03:16:38.159]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.159 --> 03:16:41.942]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.942 --> 03:16:43.222]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.222 --> 03:16:44.563]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.563 --> 03:16:50.767]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.767 --> 03:16:52.188]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.853 --> 03:16:56.314]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[03:16:56.314 --> 03:16:59.135]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:16:59.135 --> 03:17:01.055]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:17:01.055 --> 03:17:06.096]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:17:06.096 --> 03:17:09.397]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:17:09.397 --> 03:17:15.659]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:17:15.659 --> 03:17:21.340]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work, and have a lifetime
[03:17:21.340 --> 03:17:23.522]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[03:17:23.522 --> 03:17:27.185]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[03:17:27.185 --> 03:17:29.126]  You can easily find Sunny Bay Heating Pads on Amazon.
[03:17:29.126 --> 03:17:31.228]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:54.304 --> 03:17:58.245]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.245 --> 03:18:01.546]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.546 --> 03:18:07.808]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.808 --> 03:18:10.589]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.329 --> 03:18:15.134]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.134 --> 03:18:21.623]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.623 --> 03:18:26.589]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.321 --> 03:18:31.243]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.243 --> 03:18:38.448]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.448 --> 03:18:43.151]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.151 --> 03:18:49.374]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.374 --> 03:18:53.337]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:54.235 --> 03:19:02.741]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.741 --> 03:19:04.202]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:04.202 --> 03:19:08.905]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.905 --> 03:19:11.987]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:19:12.467 --> 03:19:14.129]  I still have that energy.
[03:19:14.129 --> 03:19:34.308]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.788 --> 03:19:38.792]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:19:57.748 --> 03:20:00.351]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.277 --> 03:20:25.300]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:25.300 --> 03:20:31.722]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:31.722 --> 03:20:34.483]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:34.483 --> 03:20:42.225]  I'm Roger Stone, and not even technological difficulties can stop us from bringing you the real news.
[03:20:42.225 --> 03:20:43.506]  I'm in Washington, D.C.
[03:20:43.506 --> 03:20:46.187]  today for a series of meetings to talk about
[03:20:47.127 --> 03:20:58.795]  Grassroots activism, supporting the President's Supreme Court nominee, and also to begin planning to thwart what is clearly coming down the pike.
[03:20:58.795 --> 03:21:09.661]  Quite simply, if Brett Kavanaugh is rejected by the Senate, you have seen the dress rehearsal for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
[03:21:09.661 --> 03:21:13.704]  You have seen the two-party duopolies dry run.
[03:21:14.355 --> 03:21:16.156]  Here's how it works.
[03:21:16.156 --> 03:21:29.524]  If the Democrats win the House this November, a few short days from now, as soon as they take control in January, they will surely vote articles of impeachment against Donald Trump.
[03:21:30.556 --> 03:21:46.125]  Because they are empty-handed on the question of Russian collusion, that is, Russian coordination, collusion, conspiracy with the Trump campaign, their new excuse will be sexual assault by Donald Trump.
[03:21:47.180 --> 03:22:07.260]  As with Judge Kavanaugh, there is of course no evidence or proof of that, but there are a number of women who surfaced briefly in the 2016 campaign with these accusations, none of whom had any corroboration, any evidence, any proof that what they were saying was true.
[03:22:08.172 --> 03:22:12.515]  They quickly disappeared, but believe me, folks, they'll be back.
[03:22:12.515 --> 03:22:14.496]  And now there's a new standard.
[03:22:14.496 --> 03:22:18.879]  The standard is guilty until proven innocent.
[03:22:18.879 --> 03:22:22.501]  There will be a hysteria created in the country.
[03:22:22.501 --> 03:22:29.646]  The president will be accused by weeping women in the Senate trial, all of which, of course, will be televised.
[03:22:30.707 --> 03:22:37.858]  And the President's weak-kneed Republican supporters will head for the exits.
[03:22:37.858 --> 03:22:40.742]  They will vote with the Democrats.
[03:22:40.742 --> 03:22:45.810]  We need to move aggressively, but first let's examine why this is happening.
[03:22:47.770 --> 03:23:08.396]  The last few days have been revealing, between Bob Woodward's book, the anonymous op-ed, and Obama's speech, you have evidence that the deep state is preparing for the same exact type of takedown that they used to remove President John F. Kennedy.
[03:23:08.396 --> 03:23:12.597]  In his case, their game plan was somewhat more violent.
[03:23:12.597 --> 03:23:15.198]  You see, much like President Kennedy,
[03:23:16.013 --> 03:23:18.839]  Donald Trump is for peace.
[03:23:18.839 --> 03:23:22.708]  He wants to lessen tensions with North Korea.
[03:23:22.708 --> 03:23:25.975]  He wants to lessen tensions with the Russians.
[03:23:27.038 --> 03:23:52.604]  After the Bay of Pigs fiasco when President John Kennedy refused to mount an all-out assault against Cuba, and after the Cuban Missile Crisis in which JFK signaled that he wanted talks with Russia to lessen national prospects for a nuclear holocaust, well, it was too much for the deep state and they took him down.
[03:23:53.522 --> 03:24:17.787]  Prior to these more recent signals, the Washington Post phony anonymous op-ed, the Bob Woodward book, and Obama's incredible speech in which he grabbed credit for a surging economy that he predicted would never surge again, the evidence was somewhat thinner but still more troubling.
[03:24:18.641 --> 03:24:30.896]  First of all, you had a series of anonymous leaks out of Obama's intelligence services regarding the alleged collusion with the Russians.
[03:24:30.896 --> 03:24:36.043]  One of these was even admitted to under oath by FBI Director James Comey.
[03:24:36.883 --> 03:24:53.796]  Then you had a series of anti-Trump political messages that were found in the text of changes between Peter Stroke and other FBI agents regarding the fact that they could find no real evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:24:53.796 --> 03:25:03.263]  There was, as Lisa Page said, no there there, and then the Democratic Party produced a dossier
[03:25:04.063 --> 03:25:22.455]  Not a document created by law enforcement or legitimate intelligence agencies, but a partisan document that was then used as the legal rationale for the surveillance of the Republican candidate for president.
[03:25:22.455 --> 03:25:27.098]  An abuse of power that makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[03:25:27.765 --> 03:25:44.439]  And then lastly, very similar to Watergate, a former CIA and FBI operative approached members of the Trump campaign in an effort to plant faux evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:25:45.436 --> 03:25:48.737]  These are the seeds of sedition.
[03:25:48.737 --> 03:25:57.680]  These are the underlying aspects of the game in play to remove our president.
[03:25:57.680 --> 03:26:05.822]  Now there are two things that the deep state requires before they can make their move on Donald Trump.
[03:26:05.822 --> 03:26:10.524]  First and foremost is the complete silencing of InfoWars.com.
[03:26:11.821 --> 03:26:17.042]  They want Alex Jones shut up and as quickly as possible.
[03:26:17.042 --> 03:26:35.506]  Because they know that millions of Americans tune into InfoWars through whatever app or whatever platform they choose to get the truth, the raw, I like to call it, stone cold truth about what's happening in Washington and what the globalists are really up to.
[03:26:35.506 --> 03:26:39.507]  Then, as I have said here many times, they would like to lock me up.
[03:26:40.282 --> 03:26:40.883]  Thank you.
[03:27:02.273 --> 03:27:03.614]  Don't let them do it, folks.
[03:27:03.614 --> 03:27:09.776]  Go to the InfoWars.com site right now because we need your help as never before.
[03:27:09.776 --> 03:27:12.737]  InfoWars is a beacon of freedom.
[03:27:12.737 --> 03:27:15.018]  We are Freedom Command Central.
[03:27:15.018 --> 03:27:23.202]  This is where you will hear up-to-the-minute reports on exactly what the deep state is up to in their efforts to take down our president.
[03:27:23.202 --> 03:27:30.185]  We will tell you when and how to act with grassroots activism to counter the efforts of the left.
[03:27:31.374 --> 03:27:41.705]  But we cannot do it without your support, and we cannot do it while we are facing the kind of censorship that they hope to put on us.
[03:27:41.705 --> 03:27:45.029]  We are really not crying wolf.
[03:27:45.029 --> 03:27:51.256]  We are operating under, as you can see, some technological restraints.
[03:27:51.256 --> 03:27:52.237]  But we do know this.
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:27:56.102]  Shutting down InfoWars is crucial.
[03:27:56.102 --> 03:27:58.264]  Tim Cook is lying.
[03:27:58.264 --> 03:28:13.356]  It is only through the process of discovery and lawsuits that we're going to be able to prove that the Apple CEO lies through his teeth when he says there is no coordination.
[03:28:13.356 --> 03:28:18.720]  There's never been any discussions regarding the censorship of Alex Jones.
[03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:22.183]  He lies, and only in a court of law will we prove it.
[03:28:22.823 --> 03:28:27.305]  I'm Roger Stone, you're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'll be right back!
[03:28:53.427 --> 03:28:54.647]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:28:54.647 --> 03:28:58.568]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:28:58.568 --> 03:29:00.108]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:29:00.108 --> 03:29:03.069]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:29:03.069 --> 03:29:08.630]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:09.830]  I can help you, too.

[03:33:09.366 --> 03:33:13.733]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:33:13.733 --> 03:33:18.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:18.240 --> 03:33:21.445]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:24.557 --> 03:33:25.858]  Welcome back.
[03:33:25.858 --> 03:33:44.088]  I'm Roger Stone, pinch hitting for the Alex Jones Show and broadcasting from a hotel room in Washington, D.C., where I'm here to not only meet with activists in preparation for the deep state's move on our president, which is surely coming,
[03:33:44.788 --> 03:33:49.951]  The Kavanaugh assault is the dry run for the establishment.
[03:33:49.951 --> 03:34:02.438]  It is their first attempt to take down a presidential nominee and to delay his Supreme Court appointment in the hopes that they will gain control of the U.S.
[03:34:02.438 --> 03:34:10.483]  Senate this November and thwart the president's attempt to have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court.
[03:34:11.241 --> 03:34:16.346]  Now, Judge Brett Kavanaugh was not my first choice for this nomination.
[03:34:16.346 --> 03:34:28.076]  In fact, I took to the airwaves right here at InfoWars, wrote an extensive piece about why I was concerned regarding his close relationship with the Bush crime family.
[03:34:29.137 --> 03:34:42.471]  And his role in the cover-up of the death of Vince Foster, the White House counsel to Bill and Hillary Clinton, whose body was found in Fort Marcy Park, Virginia.
[03:34:43.397 --> 03:34:46.558]  I don't think Foster was murdered by the Clintons.
[03:34:46.558 --> 03:34:48.859]  I believe he took his own life.
[03:34:48.859 --> 03:35:04.925]  But I'm virtually certain that the Clintons, particularly Mrs. Clinton, ordered that his body be removed from the old executive office building where I think he committed suicide after relentless verbal abuse by the First Lady.
[03:35:05.545 --> 03:35:21.191]  In an open White House staff meeting, senior staff meeting, that would explain why the FBI toxicology report showed that his body was completely covered by fiber from a carpet.
[03:35:21.191 --> 03:35:24.072]  That's because they rolled him in a carpet to remove him.
[03:35:25.158 --> 03:35:31.504]  And I was concerned about the role that Brett Kavanaugh played regarding a man named Patrick Knowlton.
[03:35:31.504 --> 03:35:48.119]  Knowlton was just an everyday citizen who happened along the park at the wrong time, saw men emerging from the woods where they had dumped the body of Vince Foster, and then made the mistake of reporting that to the local police.
[03:35:48.949 --> 03:36:07.615]  That brought Brett Kavanaugh and the full force of the FBI to his door demanding that he change his memory of what he had seen and instructing him that he had seen a car with Arkansas plates there at the park that in fact he hadn't seen.
[03:36:08.634 --> 03:36:16.860]  He had seen a blue car with Arkansas plates, but as I recall it, Foster's car, planted later at the park, was brown.
[03:36:16.860 --> 03:36:22.623]  All of that said, I also said that I would support whoever the president nominated.
[03:36:22.623 --> 03:36:30.849]  And I believe that the charges against Brett Kavanaugh from all of these various women are false.
[03:36:31.835 --> 03:36:43.163]  What's amazing to me is that these same liberals, these so-called feminists, continue to this day to have no issue with Bill Clinton.
[03:36:43.163 --> 03:36:54.231]  Bill Clinton is not only a serial sexual assaulter, but he's also a rapist who violently bit women through the upper lip in order to disable them.
[03:36:55.330 --> 03:37:16.939]  He bit Juanita Broderick, who has been very brave in recent days, speaking out against her abuse at the hands of Bill Clinton, and pointing out the hypocrisy of those on the left, who to this day refuse to criticize Clinton for his abuse of women.
[03:37:16.939 --> 03:37:23.682]  But more precisely, those feminists who have no issue with the fact that it was Hillary Clinton
[03:37:24.309 --> 03:37:28.672]  Who ran the campaign to silence Bill's victims.
[03:37:28.672 --> 03:37:45.983]  It was Hillary Clinton who hired the heavy-handed private detectives and the mean lawyers to threaten women like Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones and so many others into silence.
[03:37:45.983 --> 03:37:53.828]  Hillary Clinton told us that she was an advocate for women when in fact she was a terrorizer of women.
[03:37:54.668 --> 03:38:17.759]  Today, I saw a video of Hillary Clinton attacking Bill's victims, calling Jennifer Flowers, who was in a consensual relationship with her husband, a failed cabaret singer, calling the whole issue of Bill's abuse of women, Willie Horton Part 2.
[03:38:18.974 --> 03:38:21.234]  Nice try, Hillary.
[03:38:21.234 --> 03:38:23.275]  You are busted.
[03:38:23.275 --> 03:38:30.376]  Anybody who wants the facts on the Clinton's war on women can go to my book, The Clinton's War on Women.
[03:38:30.376 --> 03:38:34.317]  It's available at the Infowars.com store now.
[03:38:34.317 --> 03:38:48.000]  This is the definitive oppo-dump on Bill and Hillary Clinton, the abusers of women, that the feminists who are raging against Brett Kavanaugh still refuse, even today, to criticize.
[03:38:48.780 --> 03:38:50.201]  Hypocrisy.
[03:38:50.201 --> 03:38:52.263]  Thy name is liberal.
[03:38:52.263 --> 03:38:56.366]  Let's take, for example, Senator Mazie Hirono.
[03:38:56.366 --> 03:39:01.530]  An amazing interview the other day where she said men just need to shut up.
[03:39:01.530 --> 03:39:10.997]  And that it's time to step up and block the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh based on no evidence, no corroboration, and no proof.
[03:39:11.778 --> 03:39:15.559]  But where was Mazie Hirono when senior U.S.
[03:39:15.559 --> 03:39:24.481]  Senator Dan Inouye, the man who dominated the Hawaii Democratic machine, was a U.S.
[03:39:24.481 --> 03:39:32.102]  Senator and he was accused of sexual assault by a woman named Lenore Kwok, a hairdresser.
[03:39:32.102 --> 03:39:38.523]  At that point, Senator Hirono was in her 12th term in the Hawaii House.
[03:39:38.523 --> 03:39:39.584]  And do you know what she said?
[03:39:39.584 --> 03:39:40.904]  Nothing.
[03:39:42.308 --> 03:39:44.889]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:39:44.889 --> 03:39:49.810]  So, Mazie, why didn't you step up, as you put it?
[03:39:49.810 --> 03:39:53.952]  Perhaps you're the one who should shut up.
[03:39:53.952 --> 03:40:01.414]  It is extraordinary to see the enormous hypocrisy of these Democrats.
[03:40:01.414 --> 03:40:03.855]  Let's take, for example, Richard Blumenthal.
[03:40:04.654 --> 03:40:19.301]  Blumenthal actually has the cojones to read the Latin translation of the legal maxim that if you are caught lying about one thing, it is reasonable to assume that you are lying about everything.
[03:40:19.301 --> 03:40:29.686]  Well, Senator Blumenthal, what about your lying about serving in the military in Vietnam when you never were anywhere near Vietnam?
[03:40:30.259 --> 03:40:35.022]  You use this in every campaign for public office you ran in.
[03:40:35.022 --> 03:40:37.643]  We still have no apology from you.
[03:40:37.643 --> 03:40:40.525]  We still have no acknowledgement that you lied.
[03:40:40.525 --> 03:40:51.751]  Do you really have the audacity to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of lying, giving your history as a serial liar?
[03:40:52.688 --> 03:40:54.971]  Yes, that's Richard Blumenthal.
[03:40:54.971 --> 03:41:03.043]  He's a disgrace to those brave men and women from the nutmeg state who did serve their country in Vietnam.
[03:41:03.043 --> 03:41:09.112]  Yet, he continues his unrelenting attack on Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:41:09.915 --> 03:41:16.200]  In the meantime, folks, I want to commend Alex Jones for having the courage to sue PayPal.
[03:41:16.200 --> 03:41:18.401]  It's really not about the economics.
[03:41:18.401 --> 03:41:21.744]  It's about exposing exactly what's going on here.
[03:41:21.744 --> 03:41:25.627]  And before it's all over, I fear he's going to have to sue Apple.
[03:41:26.347 --> 03:41:37.137]  Facebook, Twitter, and all of these social media platforms that are so desperate to end the clarion call of what we do here at InfoWars.
[03:41:37.137 --> 03:41:43.943]  Because you see, it is only under oath and in discovery that we can really prove their insidious plot.
[03:41:43.943 --> 03:41:52.871]  That we can prove that the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, when he says he's never discussed Alex Jones with anyone, is lying through his teeth.
[03:41:53.612 --> 03:42:02.902]  In the meantime, these lawsuits cost money, and therefore I ask you to go to the InfoWars.com store now and find the donate button.
[03:42:02.902 --> 03:42:11.592]  Even if you're not in the mood or the market for one of our great nutraceuticals or a book or a t-shirt, we'll show you right now how you can donate.
[03:42:12.613 --> 03:42:18.999]  Send us $25, $50, $100, $500.
[03:42:18.999 --> 03:42:22.142]  Some have even sent, yes, $1,000.
[03:42:22.142 --> 03:42:25.305]  Because our fight is your fight.
[03:42:25.305 --> 03:42:30.570]  If they silence Alex Jones today, who will be silenced tomorrow?
[03:42:30.570 --> 03:42:32.932]  We need your support.
[03:42:32.932 --> 03:42:36.976]  Please find that donate button and send us a generous contribution.
[03:42:37.456 --> 03:42:43.400]  We will never fold on you, but we need you to have our back.
[03:42:43.400 --> 03:42:44.801]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:44.801 --> 03:42:53.286]  I'll be right back.
[03:42:53.286 --> 03:42:57.209]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:42:58.539 --> 03:43:07.222]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:43:07.222 --> 03:43:09.203]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:43:09.203 --> 03:43:12.664]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:43:12.664 --> 03:43:15.285]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:43:15.285 --> 03:43:17.566]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:43:17.566 --> 03:43:24.509]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:43:25.049 --> 03:43:34.851]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:43:34.851 --> 03:43:36.031]  We'll win.
[03:43:36.031 --> 03:43:38.352]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:43:38.352 --> 03:43:46.094]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:43:46.094 --> 03:43:49.794]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:43:49.794 --> 03:43:51.335]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[03:43:51.335 --> 03:43:52.215]  We need your support.
[03:43:52.215 --> 03:43:52.755]  I'm counting on you.
[03:43:53.203 --> 03:43:55.564]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:43:55.564 --> 03:44:02.146]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[03:44:02.146 --> 03:44:09.549]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child, built from the ground up to support your child's development.
[03:44:09.969 --> 03:44:19.616]  This formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[03:44:19.616 --> 03:44:31.105]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[03:44:31.605 --> 03:44:41.436]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega 3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[03:44:41.436 --> 03:44:45.781]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[03:44:45.781 --> 03:44:49.945]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:53.945 --> 03:45:02.453]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.453 --> 03:45:03.674]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:03.674 --> 03:45:08.218]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:45:08.218 --> 03:45:13.623]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:45:13.843 --> 03:45:33.998]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:45:34.498 --> 03:45:38.500]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it is gone.
[03:45:38.500 --> 03:45:42.162]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:45:42.162 --> 03:45:47.165]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:45:47.165 --> 03:45:49.906]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:45:49.906 --> 03:45:52.768]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:54.825 --> 03:45:57.806]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[03:45:57.806 --> 03:46:00.407]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[03:46:00.407 --> 03:46:02.287]  No one else has this from deep earth.
[03:46:02.287 --> 03:46:04.308]  Crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[03:46:04.308 --> 03:46:05.808]  It's very hard for me to get.
[03:46:05.808 --> 03:46:07.708]  It's the good halogen.
[03:46:07.708 --> 03:46:16.371]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[03:46:16.371 --> 03:46:18.951]  Bio-Truth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[03:46:18.951 --> 03:46:20.392]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[03:46:21.692 --> 03:46:27.418]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[03:46:27.418 --> 03:46:29.199]  So these go incredibly well together.
[03:46:29.199 --> 03:46:30.781]  We have a combo of those.
[03:46:30.781 --> 03:46:32.162]  Just experience it for yourself.
[03:46:32.162 --> 03:46:34.884]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[03:46:34.884 --> 03:46:35.925]  Very simple stuff.
[03:46:35.925 --> 03:46:37.546]  Filter your water.
[03:46:37.546 --> 03:46:39.468]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[03:46:39.468 --> 03:46:41.230]  Best out there for the price.
[03:46:41.230 --> 03:46:42.191]  When I say it's the last run.
[03:46:43.396 --> 03:46:44.976]  I think it'll be six bucks a year until we get more.
[03:46:44.976 --> 03:46:45.796]  I hope we get more.
[03:46:45.796 --> 03:46:47.117]  This is the last run, it looks like.
[03:46:47.117 --> 03:46:47.657]  Survival Short X2.
[03:46:47.657 --> 03:46:49.577]  InfowarsShort.com or InfowarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:49.577 --> 03:46:51.077]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:46:51.077 --> 03:46:51.518]  I follow Mark.
[03:47:10.671 --> 03:47:13.037]  Let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:47:13.037 --> 03:47:15.001]  You're listening to Roger Stone.
[03:47:15.001 --> 03:47:15.743]  On and forth.
[03:47:21.866 --> 03:47:22.947]  Welcome back.
[03:47:22.947 --> 03:47:28.052]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:47:28.052 --> 03:47:43.206]  And now we're going to take you to a really incredible report from Millie Weaver, who brings us this report from Johnson City, Tennessee, where President Donald Trump has just had a rally.
[03:47:43.206 --> 03:47:45.828]  This will really blow your mind.
[03:47:45.828 --> 03:47:46.569]  Let's roll it.
[03:47:47.745 --> 03:47:51.368]  So why are you waving a Mexican flag like from Mexico?
[03:47:51.368 --> 03:47:52.028]  From Mexico.
[03:47:52.028 --> 03:47:56.091]  We support Mexicans all the way.
[03:47:56.091 --> 03:47:57.912]  So what is the point of it?
[03:47:57.912 --> 03:47:59.433]  Do you guys want to be Americans?
[03:47:59.433 --> 03:48:00.574]  We're not.
[03:48:00.574 --> 03:48:02.856]  No, we're US citizens, but we're just not.
[03:48:02.856 --> 03:48:03.656]  We don't support Trump.
[03:48:04.577 --> 03:48:07.158]  So do you support America?
[03:48:07.158 --> 03:48:10.540]  I support a good America.
[03:48:10.540 --> 03:48:12.041]  You support a good America?
[03:48:12.041 --> 03:48:12.881]  Yes.
[03:48:12.881 --> 03:48:17.083]  So then why do you guys wave a Mexico flag and not an America flag?
[03:48:17.083 --> 03:48:18.424]  We support Mexico.
[03:48:18.424 --> 03:48:19.705]  It's Trump not supporting us.
[03:48:20.996 --> 03:48:23.677]  So what did you say?
[03:48:23.677 --> 03:48:26.279]  We're supporting our Mexico because Trump doesn't support us.
[03:48:26.279 --> 03:48:27.339]  We support our culture.
[03:48:27.339 --> 03:48:27.579]  Yeah.
[03:48:27.579 --> 03:48:30.281]  We don't think our culture should be deported.
[03:48:30.281 --> 03:48:31.861]  Okay, so you're U.S.
[03:48:31.861 --> 03:48:33.822]  citizens though, right?
[03:48:33.822 --> 03:48:35.383]  Yeah.
[03:48:35.383 --> 03:48:38.945]  So isn't your culture American?
[03:48:38.945 --> 03:48:39.745]  No.
[03:48:39.745 --> 03:48:42.007]  We come from a Mexican lineage.
[03:48:42.007 --> 03:48:43.587]  Therefore, we brought it here into America.
[03:48:43.587 --> 03:48:46.169]  That's why we're a melting pot here in America.
[03:48:46.929 --> 03:48:52.415]  Well, don't you think most people come from different countries, but then they wave the American flag?
[03:48:52.415 --> 03:48:56.980]  For example, many of my ancestors are from Ireland.
[03:48:56.980 --> 03:49:00.584]  I wouldn't go around waving an Irish flag in America.
[03:49:00.584 --> 03:49:02.446]  We all have our own preferences, ma'am.
[03:49:04.788 --> 03:49:05.709]  We're Mexican.
[03:49:05.709 --> 03:49:08.333]  We are Mexican-Americans.
[03:49:08.333 --> 03:49:12.038]  So are you Mexicans first or Americans first?
[03:49:12.038 --> 03:49:13.740]  I'm a Mexican first.
[03:49:13.740 --> 03:49:15.642]  My parents are from Mexico.
[03:49:15.642 --> 03:49:18.005]  So you're Mexican first?
[03:49:18.005 --> 03:49:21.269]  So would you rather be in Mexico or America?
[03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:22.311]  Why can't I be in both?
[03:49:23.328 --> 03:49:24.088]  Whenever I want.
[03:49:24.088 --> 03:49:28.770]  Okay, so is that why you want open borders and stuff?
[03:49:28.770 --> 03:49:29.331]  Why not?
[03:49:29.331 --> 03:49:32.972]  Why is Trump's hate so much against Mexico?
[03:49:32.972 --> 03:49:35.113]  What has Mexico ever done to Trump?
[03:49:35.113 --> 03:49:36.854]  Nothing, right?
[03:49:36.854 --> 03:49:39.935]  Separating families is a disgrace.
[03:49:39.935 --> 03:49:42.597]  Putting children in cages is a disgrace.
[03:49:42.597 --> 03:49:51.641]  So what do you guys think about Trump just negotiating a deal with Mexico, a trade deal with Mexico and Canada that's gonna be mutually beneficial?
[03:49:51.641 --> 03:49:51.941]  He hasn't.
[03:49:52.701 --> 03:49:53.441]  He has.
[03:49:53.441 --> 03:49:55.102]  We're just waiting for Congress to approve it.
[03:49:55.102 --> 03:49:56.302]  What do you think about it?
[03:49:56.302 --> 03:49:57.762]  I don't think it's right.
[03:49:57.762 --> 03:50:01.603]  Do you think that the Mexican president shouldn't have agreed to terms with him?
[03:50:01.603 --> 03:50:02.343]  Him too.
[03:50:02.343 --> 03:50:02.663]  Really?
[03:50:02.663 --> 03:50:04.003]  Yeah.
[03:50:04.003 --> 03:50:06.404]  That's f***ed up.
[03:50:06.404 --> 03:50:06.884]  Why?
[03:50:06.884 --> 03:50:08.184]  What's bad about the deal?
[03:50:21.568 --> 03:50:22.270]  All right.
[03:50:22.270 --> 03:50:26.518]  A terrific report from Millie Weaver.
[03:50:26.518 --> 03:50:31.688]  Millie, I just want to remind you, those women have to be believed because, of course, they're women.
[03:50:31.688 --> 03:50:33.392]  That's the new standard.
[03:50:34.025 --> 03:50:34.385]  I think?
[03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:58.172]  On October 23rd.
[03:50:58.172 --> 03:51:07.476]  And it is important for us to remind people of Bill Clinton's long, documented history as an abuser of women.
[03:51:07.476 --> 03:51:18.000]  A man who has not only sexually assaulted, exposed himself to, but bitten multiple women through the upper lip.
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:22.342]  A classic disabling move for an experienced rapist.
[03:51:23.083 --> 03:51:33.364]  Uh, and the Clinton rape t-shirt, which we just showed you, which will ultimately end up in the Smithsonian, is an iconic, uh, uh, uh...
[03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:39.933]  Memento from the most improbable election in American history.
[03:51:39.933 --> 03:52:01.008]  You see, back in the 1980s, when we only had three television networks, and CNN and Fox were in their infancy, it was much easier to mow mow the national press, to intimidate them and bully them out of reporting about Bill Clinton's epic
[03:52:06.551 --> 03:52:07.452]  We're good to go.
[03:52:25.742 --> 03:52:45.579]  Where Ron DeSantis, a Trump supporter, a member of Congress who resigned his seat in order to pursue this campaign for governor, is locked in a skin-tight battle with Andrew Gillum, the Socialist Democrat mayor of Tallahassee.
[03:52:45.579 --> 03:52:49.162]  Also on the ballot is a pivotally important U.S.
[03:52:49.162 --> 03:52:49.743]  Senate race.
[03:52:50.363 --> 03:52:59.074]  Where Governor Rick Scott has hobbled his own campaign through his opposition to medicinal marijuana.
[03:52:59.074 --> 03:53:03.800]  Medicinal marijuana was approved by 71.5% of the voters of Florida in that election.
[03:53:09.524 --> 03:53:25.276]  When the voters approved medicinal marijuana, they did not anticipate that the Republican legislature would pass enabling legislation which says you can have medicinal cannabis, you just can't smoke it.
[03:53:25.276 --> 03:53:36.145]  Well, that means that people who use cannabis as medicine need to either have a vape device or use the more expensive orals.
[03:53:36.764 --> 03:53:43.388]  Clearly, it's aimed at poor people and disproportionately African Americans.
[03:53:43.388 --> 03:53:55.796]  This is very unpopular, so John Morgan, the man who put medicinal marijuana on the ballot, took Governor Rick Scott to court and he won.
[03:53:55.796 --> 03:54:01.480]  The courts avoided the law that said you could not smoke medicinal cannabis.
[03:54:02.180 --> 03:54:07.742]  Now, Governor Rick Scott insists on appealing that ruling.
[03:54:07.742 --> 03:54:12.563]  There is not a lawyer alive who believes he will win that appeal.
[03:54:12.563 --> 03:54:19.065]  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people wait for their medicine.
[03:54:19.065 --> 03:54:26.728]  Medicine they take as an alternative to the far more damaging and deleterious opioids.
[03:54:26.728 --> 03:54:30.409]  Will this race take down the entire Republican ticket?
[03:54:31.229 --> 03:54:43.203]  Unfortunately, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis, who I'm actually supporting, has agreed to support Governor Rick Scott's appeal.
[03:54:43.203 --> 03:54:46.868]  So have the other Republican candidates on the ballot.
[03:54:47.569 --> 03:54:53.411]  This could be the secret weapon of the Democrats in a battleground state.
[03:54:53.411 --> 03:54:59.512]  Let me remind you, both John McCain and Mitt Romney lost Florida.
[03:54:59.512 --> 03:55:13.016]  Donald Trump won Florida on the basis of an extraordinarily strong performance in the state's rural areas, overcoming an enormous Democratic advantage in the three southern counties.
[03:55:13.778 --> 03:55:18.102]  Everyone will be watching Florida to see how it goes.
[03:55:18.102 --> 03:55:23.348]  It will be viewed as a precursor for the 2020 election.
[03:55:23.348 --> 03:55:34.999]  Will Governor Rick Scott and his anti-cannabis position, rejected by 71.5% of Florida voters, take down the entire Republican ticket?
[03:55:35.769 --> 03:55:38.472]  It's entirely possible.
[03:55:38.472 --> 03:55:45.918]  In the meantime, we will be greeting Hillary Clinton in full force on October 23rd.
[03:55:45.918 --> 03:55:56.188]  So watch us here at InfoWars for more information about where and when you can go protest the lady who will be showing up wearing a shower curtain.
[03:55:56.827 --> 03:56:01.110]  If her recent public performances are any indication.
[03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:02.151]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:56:02.151 --> 03:56:04.353]  This has been the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:04.353 --> 03:56:11.638]  I'm glad that we were able to overcome our technological difficulties, even if they included bringing you this show by telephone.
[03:56:11.638 --> 03:56:14.200]  And I ask you once more to do two things.
[03:56:14.780 --> 03:56:17.382]  Go to the InfoWars.com store now.
[03:56:17.382 --> 03:56:26.207]  And if you're not in the market for one of our great products, and by the way, Brain Force Plus at 40% off is a terrific buy.
[03:56:26.207 --> 03:56:29.429]  Mental clarity and energy in a bottle.
[03:56:29.429 --> 03:56:33.992]  Safe and effective with thousands of satisfied reviews.
[03:56:34.592 --> 03:56:38.934]  And when you're finished there, go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:56:38.934 --> 03:56:41.555]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:56:41.555 --> 03:56:52.060]  Robert Mueller and his deep state thugs are poking into every aspect of my personal, private, business, social, and family life.
[03:56:52.060 --> 03:56:52.460]  Why?
[03:56:52.460 --> 03:56:57.182]  Does it have to do with Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration?
[03:56:57.182 --> 03:56:57.342]  No.
[03:56:58.082 --> 03:57:02.023]  I'm being persecuted for one reason and one reason only.
[03:57:02.023 --> 03:57:04.524]  Because I appear here on InfoWars.
[03:57:04.524 --> 03:57:07.545]  Because I bring you the cutting-edge truth.
[03:57:07.545 --> 03:57:13.707]  And because I supported Donald Trump for president and helped defeat Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:13.707 --> 03:57:16.388]  Don't let them shut InfoWars down.
[03:57:16.388 --> 03:57:18.489]  Don't let them silence me.
[03:57:18.489 --> 03:57:20.649]  We need your support today.
[03:57:20.649 --> 03:57:22.590]  Thank you and God bless you.
[03:57:26.776 --> 03:57:31.629]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:57:31.629 --> 03:57:33.132]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:57:47.196 --> 03:57:52.941]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:57:52.941 --> 03:58:00.807]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:58:00.807 --> 03:58:03.970]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:58:04.150 --> 03:58:12.201]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:58:12.201 --> 03:58:21.194]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:58:21.254 --> 03:58:27.478]  It's powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract.
[03:58:27.478 --> 03:58:33.202]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[03:59:03.126 --> 03:59:03.926]  The revolution.
