[00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:12.996]  Political outrage turns bloody in Berkeley.
[00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:22.923]  Our KPIX 5 crews were right in the middle of the chaos as both Trump supporters and anti-Trump activists come to blows.
[00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:26.946]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center.
[00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:32.010]  Around the corner and away from police protection on San Carlos Street, a mob mentality took over.
[00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.510]  We found a trap!
[00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.731]  We found a trap!
[00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:34.932]  Yeah!
[00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.864]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:42.545]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, stop!
[00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:44.467]  These were pure attacks.
[00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:51.131]  Trump supporters, men, women, even the elderly, left this building last night and walked right into danger.
[00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:55.894]  This Trump supporter was the first casualty of the day, with blood streaming out of his face.
[00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:58.776]  Pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters got into it.
[00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:07.309]  And now they're rushing it.
[00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:29.047]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.227]  It got ugly.
[00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:34.509]  Violence erupting at the event as fight broke out.
[00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.511]  Fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:40.491]  It gets pretty ugly.
[00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:44.533]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:45.634]  You want to fight?
[00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:46.914]  You better believe you got one!
[00:01:51.511 --> 00:02:00.897]  Organizers say today's rallies were meant as a show of unity against what they call a seditious fringe allegedly trying to sabotage the president.
[00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:05.881]  You can see there a FedEx delivery driver jumping in to try to put an end to the protest.
[00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:07.962]  You don't like, you don't like, get the f**k out of here!
[00:02:07.962 --> 00:02:09.283]  It's to strike the numbers.
[00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:10.084]  I'll give it to you.
[00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:13.506]  If you want to come out, you better be up a hundred of you against one of me, because that's what it's going to take.
[00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:37.083]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:44.846]  The reason we're banned, the reason we're censored, the reason we're being shut down is we expose that the Chi-Coms have basically taken control of Silicon Valley.
[00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:47.447]  It's now mainstream news and they've panicked.
[00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:50.228]  I got another report we're writing that's going to go to the president next Tuesday.
[00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:51.369]  It's going to go right to his hands.
[00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.628]  About how you're doing it and how it can be stopped.
[00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:57.730]  So good luck thinking you shut us down.
[00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.271]  You walked right into our trap.
[00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:08.136]  Now, here's why they're so upset the country's coming back from the dead.
[00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:13.559]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:18.122]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[00:03:20.114 --> 00:03:24.096]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:29.698]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[00:03:29.698 --> 00:03:34.459]  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.281]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.323]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:51.161]  Getting a good picture of everybody so we look nice and handsome and thin.
[00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:51.701]  Beautiful.
[00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.602]  Perfect.
[00:03:55.602 --> 00:04:01.064]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:03.245]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:12.909]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.950]  He's not a politician.
[00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.570]  He's one of us.
[00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:24.816]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:30.558]  Never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you.
[00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:36.899]  Carry yourself with dignity and pride.
[00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:40.140]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:47.962]  Embrace that label because it's the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference.
[00:04:49.918 --> 00:04:51.442]  And that's why they want us shut down.
[00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:52.485]  We are the outsiders.
[00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:57.639]  We are banned and we are number one on iTunes and on Android after being banned.
[00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.260]  Number one!
[00:05:00.353 --> 00:05:01.693]  We knew it was coming.
[00:05:01.693 --> 00:05:03.134]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:16.398]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:05:16.398 --> 00:05:17.398]  And then voila!
[00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:27.442]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:28.342]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:29.882]  We're good to go.
[00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:03.135]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:05.757]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.757 --> 00:06:15.965]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:23.891]  So, we've got the Twitter employees, we've got Joe Scarborough, had the dead intern found in his office, calling for him to be banned.
[00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:26.553]  We've got BuzzFeed, the New York Times, running.
[00:06:27.702 --> 00:06:32.764]  Huge polls, where 78% of their own readers say, no, we don't want Alex banned.
[00:06:32.764 --> 00:06:38.226]  Because the New York Times, in fact, print me that article, please, asked the question, well, should he be completely banned everywhere?
[00:06:38.226 --> 00:06:41.888]  Hell, should he be thrown in a gulag, basically?
[00:06:41.888 --> 00:06:43.229]  And people said, no, you're crazy.
[00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:53.373]  And then you read all the Twitter comments, even people that don't like me, or don't like the straw man that mainstream media has built about me, said, this is authoritarianism, big time.
[00:06:54.301 --> 00:06:54.943]  Here it is.
[00:06:54.943 --> 00:07:01.337]  Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, and Apple have removed Alex Jones and InfoWars from their platforms.
[00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:03.322]  Should Twitter follow suit?
[00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:15.080]  Over 11,000 users, this was days ago, it's more than that now, have responded at the time of the writing with 78% rejecting the proposal, only 14% supporting it.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:28.372]  Users have swam the Times for encouraging more censorship from authoritarian tech giants, also citing the paper's highly controversial hire of outspoken anti-white journalist Sarah Young to its editorial board in blatant hypocrisy.
[00:07:30.063 --> 00:07:34.344]  But at least you can show her tweets where she says whites are subhumans and need to be exterminated.
[00:07:34.344 --> 00:07:38.184]  They don't ever show anything I say.
[00:07:38.184 --> 00:07:42.665]  They just go, Jones says the moon landings didn't happen, never said it.
[00:07:42.665 --> 00:07:47.126]  Jones says there's Martian bases, never, with slaves on it, never said it.
[00:07:47.126 --> 00:07:52.347]  Jones says nobody died at Sandy Hook and bullies the families, that's out of context from years ago.
[00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:55.108]  They never show me saying I think they died.
[00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:56.228]  They reopen it.
[00:07:56.228 --> 00:07:57.308]  They reopen the wounds.
[00:07:58.558 --> 00:08:12.766]  But they're the New York Times that quarterbacked the lies about WMD, Yellow Cake, Aluminum Tubes, consciously with the Office of Special Plans to launch that evil war that killed millions and many of our troops as well.
[00:08:12.766 --> 00:08:17.488]  So, the vast majority voted against it.
[00:08:17.488 --> 00:08:21.830]  People say, I would never have thought about listening to or supporting Alex Jones until today.
[00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.533]  This won't end well for the leftists who support this deplatforming, warned another user.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.921]  When I sit there and I watch Brian Stelter and all the usual suspects and clips online, people only watch it to ridicule it.
[00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:37.102]  They don't actually watch the main program usually.
[00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:56.507]  They're like, Donald Trump wants to shut down the internet and free press.
[00:08:56.507 --> 00:08:57.128]  He's dangerous.
[00:08:57.128 --> 00:08:58.248]  He wants blood everywhere.
[00:08:58.248 --> 00:09:01.169]  He wants us killed because he criticizes us.
[00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:05.690]  It's horrible that he wants to shut down media and says he doesn't like the First Amendment.
[00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.930]  Donald Trump said none of that.
[00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.251]  He counter punches to you liars.
[00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:15.372]  And then you'll have the same program, the same hour, whether like
[00:09:17.096 --> 00:09:20.361]  Twitter needs to ban Alex Jones right now.
[00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:21.763]  Why is he still on?
[00:09:21.763 --> 00:09:23.485]  He should be banned from everywhere.
[00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:26.550]  He's clearly a very dangerous person.
[00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.617]  We can't allow evil, racist, horrible, Nazi ideas like this to continue.
[00:09:31.617 --> 00:09:32.439]  It's too dangerous.
[00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.833]  So out of one side of their mouth, they're like, shut Alex Jones down, shut all the conservatives down.
[00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:42.097]  Senator Murphy says Jones is just the tip of the rotting iceberg.
[00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:43.678]  Ban all the conservatives.
[00:09:43.678 --> 00:09:45.440]  Our democracy depends on it.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.684]  You mean America has politically realigned against you?
[00:09:50.684 --> 00:09:55.348]  You've been denying the censorship, so now you're just admitting it.
[00:09:55.348 --> 00:09:57.950]  Fucking Braveheart, they ask, what are you doing?
[00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.233]  To William Wallace, he says, I'm going to pick a fight.
[00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:04.632]  And that's what we've done, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:04.632 --> 00:10:09.695]  We didn't say any of the things that they said we said.
[00:10:09.695 --> 00:10:20.582]  What we did do was let the New York Times, the Washington Post, and others know that there's been more hidden camera footage of their people coming out soon.
[00:10:20.582 --> 00:10:23.564]  And it's damning.
[00:10:23.564 --> 00:10:27.106]  And more importantly, we talked about the CHICOMS and told everybody
[00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:43.808]  The personnel, Office of Personnel Management hack was an Obama handover of our infrastructure, a globalist merger that China is on a war footing against us, that Apple and Google have officially moved to China and are building censorship systems here in their own whistleblowers admissions.
[00:10:43.808 --> 00:10:49.194]  They don't want me amplifying what the intercept documents show.
[00:10:49.194 --> 00:10:53.138]  And I told the crew here, last week, I said, you watch.
[00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:59.396]  I believe we'll be banned by next week for this China reporting.
[00:10:59.396 --> 00:11:03.682]  Because we also said on Friday that Feinstein had a Chinese spy.
[00:11:03.682 --> 00:11:04.283]  She wasn't.
[00:11:04.283 --> 00:11:05.625]  She didn't have a Chinese spy.
[00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:07.067]  She put him there on purpose.
[00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.710]  That was part of her marriage to China.
[00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.733]  Her husband's biotech company based in China.
[00:11:14.588 --> 00:11:16.189]  She's a Chinese spy.
[00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:20.032]  And man, I said that, it's my last Friday, last Thursday.
[00:11:20.032 --> 00:11:25.657]  And then when that came out over the weekend, they went, whoa, who does Jones know?
[00:11:25.657 --> 00:11:28.039]  Man, I don't need to get this from the Pentagon.
[00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:36.545]  I get it from my own open source research about who surrounds her and some quick checking, you know, the Democrats are Chinese communist agents.
[00:11:36.545 --> 00:11:39.768]  It was the Rockefeller plan.
[00:11:39.768 --> 00:11:40.789]  That's who they are.
[00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:51.598]  You think China didn't have running water in 1949 almost anywhere but a few hotels?
[00:11:51.598 --> 00:11:59.182]  I mean, China until the 80s, most bathrooms were latrines at restaurants.
[00:11:59.182 --> 00:12:03.785]  You go to many areas of China still, there's a hole in the ground you crap in.
[00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:09.609]  How did they go from not having a pot to piss in, and now they've got everything better than us?
[00:12:11.889 --> 00:12:13.829]  We were sold out.
[00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:16.310]  They have tariffs on everything, we have nothing on them.
[00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.330]  They have slave labor.
[00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.211]  It was a setup.
[00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:32.693]  And I'm a patriotic, loyal American because I believe in Americanism and I believe in the free market and I believe in the vision of the Renaissance.
[00:12:32.693 --> 00:12:34.594]  And I've just been advising Congress
[00:12:36.328 --> 00:12:42.650]  And everybody else, they're talking about Russia collusion because we have them on China.
[00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.711]  We have them.
[00:12:43.711 --> 00:12:44.651]  We have them.
[00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:49.233]  We have them.
[00:12:49.233 --> 00:12:52.214]  We have them politically in our gun sites.
[00:12:52.214 --> 00:12:53.874]  That does not mean we're going to shoot them.
[00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:57.296]  I think the public's going to go, Jones claims Feinstein's in his gun sites.
[00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:57.816]  Politically.
[00:12:58.513 --> 00:13:04.478]  Just like Giuliani said that this whole investigation is going to blow up in Mueller's face.
[00:13:04.478 --> 00:13:12.524]  That doesn't mean blow him up with C4 or TNT or dynamite like Wile E. Coyote.
[00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:16.187]  It means it's going to blow up in his face like every thinking person knows.
[00:13:21.527 --> 00:13:23.108]  It's all coming down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:23.108 --> 00:13:24.650]  Folks better decide which side they're on.
[00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.733]  So I have a statement at InfoWars.com that we've retweeted at RealAlexJones.
[00:13:28.733 --> 00:13:30.134]  I'm going to retweet it again.
[00:13:30.134 --> 00:13:33.677]  Alex Jones has written a statement on internet censorship.
[00:13:33.677 --> 00:13:38.781]  And then I'm going to get into what's really going on with Jack Dorsey and what's going to unfold.
[00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:41.264]  But this is all about the elections.
[00:13:41.264 --> 00:13:43.285]  This is all about free speech.
[00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:46.948]  This is all about setting the precedent to de-platform everybody.
[00:13:46.948 --> 00:13:49.831]  And it's about bringing in the communist Chinese style
[00:13:51.823 --> 00:14:00.949]  Global social score that Google developed as a social engineering control tool to track everything you do that China has bought.
[00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:02.770]  This is all on record.
[00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.432]  We first broke it five years ago.
[00:14:05.432 --> 00:14:08.134]  Now it's all on record.
[00:14:08.134 --> 00:14:12.296]  And the enemy just keeps asking, how do we know all this?
[00:14:12.296 --> 00:14:14.218]  The nose knows.
[00:14:14.218 --> 00:14:17.480]  I mean, I study all this stuff and then I'm able to integrate it together.
[00:14:18.387 --> 00:14:23.792]  And I'm able to understand how these systems work and a lot of you guys brag about this stuff in white paper so I can figure it out.
[00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:29.757]  But now, people figure out what Jones figures out is what's going on.
[00:14:29.757 --> 00:14:36.263]  And they want me shut up as if... You guys understand I would be more devastating as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill.
[00:14:36.263 --> 00:14:38.444]  Just going in and talking to people and giving them reports.
[00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:39.946]  I'm starting to figure that out too.
[00:14:39.946 --> 00:14:42.868]  Why sit here and talk to the masses?
[00:14:42.868 --> 00:14:43.429]  Reports.
[00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:54.097]  Reports, because people already know my reports, our reports are kryptonite to evil, kryptonite to globalism, kryptonite to the shycomps.
[00:14:54.097 --> 00:14:57.880]  And so we get more sophisticated by the month.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:04.445]  We learn more in a month now than we learn in a year before.
[00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:08.589]  And by the way, we were already when we launched this new app and I heard him up.
[00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:09.790]  I said, get the app out soon.
[00:15:11.613 --> 00:15:15.916]  The app was ready a few months ago, and I got busy and didn't plug it, so we officially launched it about 3-4 weeks ago.
[00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:19.860]  It was already in the top 40 of news apps, because we're popular already.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:30.168]  And then when they banned it, it went to number 3, now number 1 on iTunes and Android, and it's number 40-something, or maybe it's 30 now, in just total apps globally.
[00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:39.183]  And then, oh my God, the New York Times, the Washington Post, Piss Feed, all of them, Buzzkill.
[00:15:39.183 --> 00:15:43.285]  They don't know what to do when it's number one.
[00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:47.668]  And they just can't stand it because, again, the Streisand effect blew up.
[00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:50.429]  And this isn't China, where they gotta test their censorship systems.
[00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:52.411]  It's America, so there's still some fightin' spirit.
[00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:53.291]  So they don't know what to do.

[00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:29.870]  At least a while.
[00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.272]  I'm dying in your beds many years from now.
[00:20:34.272 --> 00:20:51.040]  Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
[00:20:53.459 --> 00:20:58.463]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:20:58.463 --> 00:21:06.489]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:21:06.489 --> 00:21:08.411]  There's a lot of other big world news happening.
[00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:12.174]  I intend to open the phones up today to get your take on what's unfolding.
[00:21:13.655 --> 00:21:24.620]  But obviously, we are at the center right now of the big global controversy of, oh, we've demonized this guy Alex Jones.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:30.043]  He's bad because we all agree in mainstream media and academia.
[00:21:30.043 --> 00:21:31.264]  So let's deplatform him.
[00:21:31.264 --> 00:21:32.124]  Let's shut him off.
[00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.906]  Let's contact all the companies that run software for his websites.
[00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:39.848]  And let's just bankrupt him in a giant coordinated mafia attack.
[00:21:41.977 --> 00:21:43.718]  That's what the Nazis did in Nazi Germany.
[00:21:43.718 --> 00:21:45.238]  That's what the Mafia did in this country.
[00:21:45.238 --> 00:21:47.419]  It's totally illegal.
[00:21:47.419 --> 00:21:51.740]  But they think they're gonna get away with it and set the precedent for it.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.221]  Not if the American people contact Congress.
[00:21:55.221 --> 00:21:56.902]  Not if folks take action.
[00:21:56.902 --> 00:22:02.584]  So, I am asking to be able to testify to Congress.
[00:22:02.584 --> 00:22:05.364]  And to go under, you know, the hot lights.
[00:22:05.364 --> 00:22:08.085]  But I want it to be live and on television.
[00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:10.266]  And to really lay out what's really going on here.
[00:22:12.048 --> 00:22:20.235]  And I've been talking to several members of Congress, and I have other sources talking to them as well, about sponsoring us in a committee to have those hearings.
[00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:22.316]  And then to come in and lay out what's really going on.
[00:22:22.316 --> 00:22:26.099]  Because I can walk in there with exhibits of the quotes of U.S.
[00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:32.284]  Senators, you name it, saying they want to shut down their competition politically.
[00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:32.925]  So let me now
[00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:46.296]  Read to you my statement that's on Infowars.com that we just retweeted at RealAlexJones on Twitter and at Prison Planet on Paul Watson's Twitter.
[00:22:46.296 --> 00:22:54.578]  Because what you're about to hear exactly three months out from the critical midterm election, the most important midterm election in U.S.
[00:22:54.578 --> 00:22:57.339]  history undoubtedly, what you're about to hear
[00:22:59.218 --> 00:23:23.747]  Is the key to having the will of the people and a free open election take place to continue making this country great again and taking it out from under the control of the big multinational banks, the corrupt influence of the EU, but mainly the communist Chinese that own our debt, own Hollywood, have thousands of front companies in the U.S., control major universities, and are now working with big tech giants to complete censorship here in America.
[00:23:23.747 --> 00:23:27.689]  This is a 21st century economic and cyber invasion.
[00:23:28.797 --> 00:23:33.419]  And I, as a modern Paul Revere, am raising the alarm.
[00:23:33.419 --> 00:23:35.660]  They tried to buy me off a long time ago.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.521]  Almost anybody wants to be famous and part of Hollywood.
[00:23:38.521 --> 00:23:42.323]  And I was, you want to put me in movies and starring roles?
[00:23:42.323 --> 00:23:43.304]  At my own TV show?
[00:23:43.304 --> 00:23:45.044]  $10 million a year?
[00:23:45.044 --> 00:23:50.707]  That was a lot of money in 2005, 2006.
[00:23:50.707 --> 00:23:51.808]  But I turned it down, folks.
[00:23:51.808 --> 00:23:53.929]  It was easy to do.
[00:23:53.929 --> 00:23:54.649]  And now you see why.
[00:23:56.365 --> 00:24:02.007]  So, they just collect people like baseball cards.
[00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:05.728]  Now, let's continue here.
[00:24:05.728 --> 00:24:09.009]  Alex Jones' written statement on Internet censorship.
[00:24:09.009 --> 00:24:11.590]  This is critical to get out.
[00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:16.912]  This is a dangerous precedent that can be used against any ideology, left or right.
[00:24:16.912 --> 00:24:20.093]  Across the board, in what appears to be a highly coordinated effort,
[00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:23.936]  And I tried to be nice there.
[00:24:23.936 --> 00:24:25.817]  It's admittedly coordinated.
[00:24:25.817 --> 00:24:44.010]  Across the board in what appears to be a highly coordinated effort to silence the message behind InfoWars and Alex Jones, most major social media backbone utilities associated with our website and video platforms have launched unprecedented account bans and suspensions on virtually all of our channels.
[00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:48.894]  Regardless of what you think of me and what you have heard indirectly through third-party sources,
[00:24:49.949 --> 00:24:54.291]  You are clearly witnessing a 21st century purge of an ideology.
[00:24:54.291 --> 00:25:11.541]  And even if you don't agree with our message, or the strawman message you've been told, that everyone should exercise their right to question the status quo, you should be very concerned about what's happening.
[00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:18.345]  Because this ideology that is now under attack is the same ideology that played a pivotal role in the founding of this great nation.
[00:25:19.628 --> 00:25:26.375]  Challenging the establishment system with independent ideas that encourage new debates and discussions.
[00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:35.144]  For more than a year we have witnessed the mainstream media, the democratic groups, tell us that the manipulation of social media could turn an election and is criminal.
[00:25:36.664 --> 00:25:52.183]  But their own admission, and by their own admission, social media would be the most viable option to alter the course of a nation, influence millions of people, and shut down free speech and personal expression that question the status quo, i.e.
[00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.765]  the global social credit score.
[00:25:55.182 --> 00:26:07.930]  We have been told that one of the greatest threats to our republic's democracy, we're a constitutional republic, is the manipulation of the information that we receive on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
[00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:21.699]  Now that these groups that have been telling us that free speech must be defended against those who seek to control it on our news feeds have launched a full-scale war on free speech and information that they disagree with.
[00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:38.508]  There is no question that large social media companies have become the nation's premier sources of information, 90% of it, referring hundreds of millions to news and information daily.
[00:26:38.508 --> 00:26:44.974]  Although these groups are private entities, their scale has achieved that of monopoly on the free flow of information.
[00:26:45.922 --> 00:27:05.633]  Much like the FCC rules that the airwaves and cables should be equally accessible to all in the public trust, these modes of communication could and should be equally open to the same access and not subject to control by those who may choose to disagree with the information itself.
[00:27:05.633 --> 00:27:10.036]  Is a different opinion enough to silence an entire ideology?
[00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:11.397]  Or ban someone to the Phantom Zone?
[00:27:12.862 --> 00:27:34.877]  I do not claim to always be right, but the accusations leveled at me are distortions of the truth and have been used to systematically impeach my character with never allowing me to respond and now attempting to completely de-platform me so I can respond to nothing so a real straw man can be built and then destroyed as the archetype to destroy all of your speech.
[00:27:37.605 --> 00:27:54.054]  But the coordinated action of the establishment to silence me has only awakened a new resolve in those who now see more clearly than ever how the establishment systems will go to any level to shut down free speech and information that questions the status quo.
[00:27:54.054 --> 00:27:56.235]  This is a turning point for our nation.
[00:27:56.235 --> 00:27:56.816]  Make no mistake.
[00:27:57.779 --> 00:28:00.542]  Will you rally behind the principles of free speech?
[00:28:00.542 --> 00:28:09.410]  Or will you concede to having your ability to access new ideas and information restricted and controlled by those who believe you cannot think for yourself?
[00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:15.917]  If we allow this level of corruption and censorship to continue, it won't be long before it becomes normalized, which is now happening.
[00:28:16.704 --> 00:28:24.927]  How long before it's not Alex Jones and InfoWars being shut down on major platforms, but any ideology that disagrees with the establishment status quo.
[00:28:24.927 --> 00:28:27.528]  There'll be cliques even within companies and subgroups.
[00:28:27.528 --> 00:28:33.529]  It's all about power and you feed into the pettiness of the worst people just giving them the power through something like this.
[00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:35.030]  It's a total nightmare.
[00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.451]  We must rally behind the principles that founded this great nation.
[00:28:38.471 --> 00:28:48.463]  And not allow deep censorship to become normalized and accepted or next we will face the other degrees of tyranny that invariably follow like night follows day and day follows night.
[00:28:48.463 --> 00:28:57.434]  We'll be back with how to fight back and who else is being censored and the Democrats call to silence everyone ahead of the midterms except their people.

[00:33:02.846 --> 00:33:05.488]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:25.742]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:33:25.742 --> 00:33:33.646]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.646 --> 00:33:41.491]  That's right, they were censoring in secret.
[00:33:51.212 --> 00:33:52.493]  But they went a little too far.
[00:33:52.493 --> 00:34:06.918]  And now they've had a policy of truth and said we want Alex Jones and every other nationalist and every other white male and every other conservative and Christian and every other capitalist banned off the internet and everything else.
[00:34:06.918 --> 00:34:08.839]  Policy of truth!
[00:34:08.839 --> 00:34:10.000]  Never again, huh?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.241]  Ha ha!
[00:34:13.241 --> 00:34:14.922]  Fools!
[00:34:14.922 --> 00:34:20.764]  And now, after our app goes to number one in the world,
[00:34:22.057 --> 00:34:32.808]  On both the Android and Google app in news and is set to go to number one total, they are in panic mode.
[00:34:32.808 --> 00:34:44.459]  CNN, MSNBC, BuzzFeed, the New York Times, they are screeching and telling Apple you must delete his app.
[00:34:45.276 --> 00:34:47.357]  I've had seven or eight apps on there before.
[00:34:47.357 --> 00:34:49.038]  They get old, we launch new ones.
[00:34:49.038 --> 00:34:50.719]  We have apps on there.
[00:34:50.719 --> 00:35:00.324]  We have an old app we launched like eight, nine years ago that's just audio and text articles that's got like nine million people that signed up for it.
[00:35:00.324 --> 00:35:02.865]  So of course millions have already signed up for this.
[00:35:02.865 --> 00:35:05.246]  Of course it's going to go to number one.
[00:35:05.246 --> 00:35:12.510]  Oh see, but you say you're the real news over at CNN when you're not rigging the debates or lying about WMDs just like the New York Times.
[00:35:14.875 --> 00:35:18.036]  And you've got the Weekly Standard, a failed publication no one reads.
[00:35:18.036 --> 00:35:19.997]  They all want us banned.
[00:35:19.997 --> 00:35:24.058]  Notice how CNN spends it when they're not getting Gulf State dictator money or Tricom money.
[00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:26.619]  It's Apple and Google.
[00:35:26.619 --> 00:35:28.539]  Put it back up, please.
[00:35:28.539 --> 00:35:42.224]  Apple and Google are still selling the InfoWars app, which contains some of the same type of content that both tech giants have pulled from elsewhere on their platforms.
[00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:43.224]  What have you been hearing here on the air?
[00:35:45.162 --> 00:35:47.824]  But they want to arrest the former mayor of London who's a liberal?
[00:35:47.824 --> 00:35:49.866]  Because he said there's people with burqas everywhere?
[00:35:49.866 --> 00:35:51.467]  That's not good in a Western society?
[00:35:51.467 --> 00:35:52.688]  Where are the feminists?
[00:35:52.688 --> 00:35:54.249]  They're looking at arresting him!
[00:35:54.249 --> 00:36:01.335]  I have the articles.
[00:36:01.335 --> 00:36:03.737]  First they were saying it was the criminal offense, now they're saying it isn't.
[00:36:03.737 --> 00:36:06.479]  This is their intimidation!
[00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:09.662]  I was in a cheesecake factory and women came in in the beekeeper suits.
[00:36:09.662 --> 00:36:10.482]  Scared the hell out of me!
[00:36:10.482 --> 00:36:11.483]  I had three daughters!
[00:36:11.483 --> 00:36:12.444]  They were there with me!
[00:36:12.444 --> 00:36:13.605]  They're like, Dad, what's that?
[00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.971]  The woman was getting food and eating under her deal!
[00:36:16.971 --> 00:36:19.493]  She's a slave under Sharia!
[00:36:19.493 --> 00:36:21.654]  She can't drive a car!
[00:36:21.654 --> 00:36:22.655]  She goes to prison!
[00:36:22.655 --> 00:36:28.258]  And she gets caught with it off her head.
[00:36:28.258 --> 00:36:32.280]  Oh, the new Burka Barbie!
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.882]  And you go to the mall now, and it's just like, you know, on the gap and everywhere.
[00:36:35.882 --> 00:36:38.044]  Paul Watson's report's coming up next segment.
[00:36:38.044 --> 00:36:40.445]  There are big signs of how cool it is.
[00:36:40.445 --> 00:36:42.026]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:46.030]  Don't open a door for me, patriarchy!
[00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:52.836]  America sucks!
[00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:59.122]  But, don't criticize somebody wearing a burka, we'll kick you off.
[00:36:59.122 --> 00:37:00.723]  And they do, in Germany, they arrest you.
[00:37:00.723 --> 00:37:09.191]  They hired former Stasi operatives to run, four years ago, the Facebook reporting of people to the police.
[00:37:10.489 --> 00:37:12.190]  To get him put in jail.
[00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.611]  That's where we are!
[00:37:13.611 --> 00:37:15.512]  The takedown of our country!
[00:37:15.512 --> 00:37:16.752]  Being conditioned and trained.
[00:37:16.752 --> 00:37:37.444]  Get everybody on the social networks, make it 90% of the web, and then condition you and shut you down if you don't submit to the insanity and have weirdos from San Francisco tell you you're not liberal because you're not into all this sickening weirdness.
[00:37:37.444 --> 00:37:38.625]  This is authoritarianism.
[00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:38.745]  So,
[00:37:39.893 --> 00:37:45.817]  Imagine, we're the number one app in news on Android and on Apple, and what is their response?
[00:37:45.817 --> 00:37:53.061]  We're number 30-something now in the world.
[00:37:53.061 --> 00:37:58.184]  Now, again, what you keep showing from yesterday is just a screenshot of trending.
[00:37:58.184 --> 00:37:59.225]  Go to the actual news.
[00:37:59.225 --> 00:38:00.766]  We're number one on Apple.
[00:38:00.766 --> 00:38:02.447]  Pull it up.
[00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:04.648]  In fact, have the crew in there get us together the new screenshots, please.
[00:38:04.648 --> 00:38:06.169]  I don't want to keep using the old ones.
[00:38:06.169 --> 00:38:09.291]  So, we've got all that going on.
[00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:17.415]  And we've got them trying to shut everybody down.
[00:38:17.415 --> 00:38:19.616]  Now think about how crazy that is.
[00:38:19.616 --> 00:38:22.636]  And Democrat senators saying, we're going to shut everybody down.
[00:38:22.636 --> 00:38:23.477]  Where's Congress?
[00:38:23.477 --> 00:38:24.437]  Where are the hearings?
[00:38:24.437 --> 00:38:26.357]  Where's everybody up in arms?
[00:38:26.357 --> 00:38:29.778]  So you got Jack Dorsey going on Sean Hannity's radio show going, I'm your friend.
[00:38:29.778 --> 00:38:30.279]  Don't run.
[00:38:30.279 --> 00:38:31.459]  We are your friends.
[00:38:31.459 --> 00:38:32.939]  Everything's fine, President Trump.
[00:38:32.939 --> 00:38:41.542]  Don't have a criminal investigation for Federal Elections Commission violations that we're blocking all the conservatives ahead of the campaign right into the midterms.
[00:38:41.542 --> 00:38:42.322]  We have them!
[00:38:46.075 --> 00:38:48.396]  And Dorsey's people are like, Dorsey, you've sold out!
[00:38:48.396 --> 00:38:49.536]  We want him banned right now!
[00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:52.337]  And he's like, I was the vanguard of censorship, idiots!
[00:38:52.337 --> 00:38:53.138]  We went too far!
[00:38:53.138 --> 00:38:54.238]  Shut up!
[00:38:54.238 --> 00:38:55.618]  They're on us!
[00:38:55.618 --> 00:39:00.720]  God Almighty, we'll get Jones later.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.881]  And then the frothing reports.
[00:39:03.881 --> 00:39:06.562]  The frothing reports everywhere.
[00:39:06.562 --> 00:39:08.443]  About how I need to be taken off the air.
[00:39:08.443 --> 00:39:09.904]  How I need to be shut down.
[00:39:09.904 --> 00:39:11.284]  How I'm the devil incarnate.
[00:39:11.284 --> 00:39:13.605]  How I'm the worst thing since the devil was born.
[00:39:16.274 --> 00:39:18.174]  By so-called liberal journalists.
[00:39:18.174 --> 00:39:19.735]  These people are authoritarians.
[00:39:19.735 --> 00:39:22.435]  Because China runs Google.
[00:39:22.435 --> 00:39:24.596]  It runs Apple now.
[00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:26.296]  The others want entree into it.
[00:39:26.296 --> 00:39:33.498]  So they're hiring people and training people who are SJWs, trained in Maoist philosophy at the universities, as the operating system.
[00:39:33.498 --> 00:39:34.738]  That isn't by accident.
[00:39:34.738 --> 00:39:42.680]  All 50 state-run colleges, it came out even in the Washington Post, are run by the Chai Koms.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.000]  This is a takeover!
[00:39:45.848 --> 00:39:48.150]  The Antifa are malice youth brigades.
[00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:52.034]  All of it is a plan.
[00:39:52.034 --> 00:39:55.318]  So if you go to InfoWars.com, we have the Steve Watson article breaking it down.
[00:39:55.318 --> 00:40:02.886]  Apple says it's monitoring the InfoWars app, threatens to censor it if it becomes harmful.
[00:40:02.886 --> 00:40:05.869]  Imagine aliens show up to see the earth, and they say,
[00:40:08.151 --> 00:40:12.615]  From a million megameters, we judge that your planet is evil and threatening.
[00:40:12.615 --> 00:40:15.318]  Stand by for planetary destruction.
[00:40:15.318 --> 00:40:17.299]  Thank you.
[00:40:17.299 --> 00:40:19.241]  We find you harmful.
[00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:21.383]  It's a subjective term, we find.
[00:40:21.383 --> 00:40:22.784]  We don't like you.
[00:40:22.784 --> 00:40:24.126]  We say you're hateful.
[00:40:24.126 --> 00:40:25.527]  We say you're bad.
[00:40:25.527 --> 00:40:26.988]  We don't show how that is.
[00:40:26.988 --> 00:40:27.849]  We don't convict you.
[00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:29.270]  We don't prove it in court.
[00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.813]  Sure, we sue you as the proof, just like Mueller indicts.
[00:40:31.813 --> 00:40:32.814]  That's the proof you're Russian.
[00:40:34.488 --> 00:40:36.049]  We control reality now.
[00:40:36.049 --> 00:40:37.809]  We are your political masters.
[00:40:37.809 --> 00:40:39.490]  We will teach you how to deceive.
[00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:41.070]  We will teach you the tricks.
[00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:45.152]  If you good earthlings join us, some of you may be able to leave with us.
[00:40:45.152 --> 00:40:46.272]  I'm doing an allegory now.
[00:40:46.272 --> 00:40:51.854]  I don't mean aliens are really about to destroy the planet, but imagine.
[00:40:51.854 --> 00:40:57.236]  After BuzzFeed and others reach out to them, they say, why is it he banned off this?
[00:40:57.236 --> 00:40:58.297]  Why do you even allow him to have an app?
[00:40:59.107 --> 00:41:03.110]  They go, well, we were streaming his services and placing it in our index.
[00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:07.052]  We've de-indexed him, but the app, just like a website, allows you to go to him.
[00:41:07.052 --> 00:41:09.213]  And, you know, that's kind of real racketeering if we do that.
[00:41:09.213 --> 00:41:15.257]  They're like, but don't worry, we're monitoring it, just like you monitor China, where Apple is now run by.
[00:41:15.257 --> 00:41:22.322]  And they said, five months ago in Reuters, that the Chinese government now runs Apple and is helping round up political dissidence and has the keys to the iCloud.
[00:41:22.322 --> 00:41:23.863]  So, I'm going to give you the headline here.
[00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:29.678]  Communist China, now in control of Apple, calls for Alex Jones to be banned.
[00:41:29.678 --> 00:41:33.165]  And they're just having a discourse and debate to see if Americans wake up.
[00:41:34.008 --> 00:41:36.130]  And they're like, OK, we may ban him.
[00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.012]  We're listening to him.
[00:41:38.012 --> 00:41:39.253]  We're watching him.
[00:41:39.253 --> 00:41:42.035]  We're listening to Alex Jones right now.
[00:41:42.035 --> 00:41:42.976]  Of course you are!
[00:41:42.976 --> 00:41:44.598]  You know, you sold out.
[00:41:44.598 --> 00:41:50.643]  You've got suicide factories, suicide nets, forced abortion, forced drugging, 18-hour workdays at Foxconn.
[00:41:50.643 --> 00:41:51.664]  You're monsters!
[00:41:51.664 --> 00:41:55.067]  You help round up Falun Gong and Christians and sell their organs!
[00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:57.690]  So of course you're introducing us to a social score.
[00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:03.514]  You're introducing us to the bad man who you first demonized for years to now sell America on this crap!
[00:42:03.514 --> 00:42:05.596]  But America is going to figure it out!
[00:42:05.596 --> 00:42:13.001]  And you're going to get your asses busted up in trust-busting and national security, and when it's all over, it'll be like World War II.
[00:42:13.001 --> 00:42:18.985]  People will ask, how the hell did they get so many Americans to join the Nazi side?
[00:42:18.985 --> 00:42:19.546]  Same deal.
[00:42:19.546 --> 00:42:21.787]  So good luck, busters.
[00:42:21.787 --> 00:42:24.409]  And then CNN's sitting there foaming at the mouth.
[00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:25.330]  Get him off the air.
[00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:26.190]  Get him off the air.
[00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.651]  Imagine.
[00:42:27.842 --> 00:42:32.277]  Apple openly censoring, openly spying on the iCloud.
[00:42:32.277 --> 00:42:33.220]  They told Reuters they go.
[00:42:34.728 --> 00:42:37.829]  When you're based in China, the government's embedded with you, and that's just how it is.
[00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:39.510]  And now the Chinese government runs Apple.
[00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.530]  We're tax-exempt.
[00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:42.011]  So they get more money!
[00:42:42.011 --> 00:42:43.952]  Now Tim Cook's a trillion-dollar company.
[00:42:43.952 --> 00:42:44.732]  Yay!
[00:42:44.732 --> 00:42:45.772]  Based on slavery!
[00:42:45.772 --> 00:42:53.915]  They've got... He's funding Black Lives Matter, teaching them about 160 years ago, so that you only think about the past, not what he's currently doing now.
[00:42:53.915 --> 00:42:57.197]  But don't worry, Tim Cook and the Chinese are set to ban us.
[00:42:57.197 --> 00:42:57.757]  Don't worry!
[00:42:59.241 --> 00:43:00.582]  We knew it was coming.
[00:43:00.582 --> 00:43:02.042]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:43:02.042 --> 00:43:15.309]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:16.289]  And then voila!
[00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:26.334]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:43:26.334 --> 00:43:27.235]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:43:28.055 --> 00:43:28.435]  I think so.
[00:43:57.978 --> 00:43:59.379]  I don't want you to see.
[00:43:59.379 --> 00:44:04.241]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:13.146]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.146 --> 00:44:18.489]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:29.254]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[00:45:30.413 --> 00:45:34.236]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[00:45:34.236 --> 00:45:39.479]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[00:45:39.479 --> 00:45:40.780]  And here's the best part.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.621]  It is absolutely free.
[00:45:42.621 --> 00:45:47.825]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[00:45:47.825 --> 00:45:51.787]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:45:51.787 --> 00:45:55.910]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:00.033]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:46:00.573 --> 00:46:06.959]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:46:06.959 --> 00:46:10.161]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:46:10.161 --> 00:46:13.865]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:46:13.865 --> 00:46:18.569]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:46:18.569 --> 00:46:21.831]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:46:22.732 --> 00:46:33.719]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:46:33.719 --> 00:46:42.265]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:46:43.886 --> 00:46:45.728]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:19.594 --> 00:47:25.623]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.875 --> 00:47:35.858]  So it's a major national security issue that Apple officially announced five months ago.
[00:47:35.858 --> 00:47:46.402]  They're Chinese communist run and are helping censor and control the Chinese people and the main iCloud keys to the entire planet are now state-run by the Chai comms.
[00:47:46.402 --> 00:47:48.023]  Communist Chinese own our national debt.
[00:47:48.023 --> 00:47:51.405]  They control all six of the major movie houses in Hollywood.
[00:47:52.285 --> 00:47:54.926]  It's been all over the news that they run Hollywood now.
[00:47:54.926 --> 00:47:57.587]  They control most of the major universities with their infiltration.
[00:47:57.587 --> 00:47:59.668]  They control Silicon Valley.
[00:47:59.668 --> 00:48:01.929]  There's even been Politico articles about that.
[00:48:01.929 --> 00:48:12.853]  And now Tim Cook, who has the most debilitated, horrible factories in the world that he subcontracts with, Foxconn, Suicide Nets, all of it, he is literally moving to ban us.
[00:48:13.613 --> 00:48:24.763]  Not just off of the iTunes streams where we were in the top ten, but now our app that we just launched three weeks ago has gone to number one in both areas, but off and on they don't even list it.
[00:48:24.763 --> 00:48:34.071]  And there are five InfoWars apps, a bunch of them aren't ours, that are in the top hundred and they're moving to delist all of those.
[00:48:35.888 --> 00:48:38.949]  And announcing that they're monitoring us and watching us.
[00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.570]  So there you go.
[00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:52.334]  And China threatened yesterday to take over Apple and Apple factories and shut down Apple factories in China if Trump continued to stand up against their trade war against us.
[00:48:52.334 --> 00:48:54.775]  Did you hear that?
[00:48:54.775 --> 00:48:58.997]  Did you hear that?
[00:48:58.997 --> 00:49:00.237]  Think about that.
[00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:01.317]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:49:01.317 --> 00:49:05.459]  Communist China openly announced
[00:49:06.969 --> 00:49:15.596]  Yesterday, that they would take over Apple and shut down production if Trump didn't submit an internal embargo by a so-called U.S.
[00:49:15.596 --> 00:49:19.079]  company that's now Chinese state-run.
[00:49:19.079 --> 00:49:20.860]  And now you understand what's really going on.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:29.567]  And they're using me, who they first demonized to the public in psychological warfare, as the test case to go, well, that Alex Jones, you know, the straw man, I heard about him.
[00:49:29.567 --> 00:49:30.228]  Nobody says that.
[00:49:30.228 --> 00:49:31.469]  They go, oh, that's a bad guy.
[00:49:33.052 --> 00:49:41.418]  You know, he said Trump would win, he believes in the Second Amendment, and he doesn't believe every official government story, and he's restoring the Republic, and he's standing firm under the attacks.
[00:49:41.418 --> 00:49:45.300]  Yeah, I want to virtue signal at the bar or work.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.462]  Yeah, he's a bad guy.
[00:49:47.462 --> 00:49:49.183]  And they go, oh, thank you.
[00:49:49.183 --> 00:49:52.865]  And then Senator Murphy comes out and says, we're going to ban all conservatives offline.
[00:49:52.865 --> 00:49:57.268]  It's for the future of our democracy that your speech be banned.
[00:49:57.268 --> 00:50:01.091]  That's the weird, sick ways they talk, the weird, sick things they do.
[00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:17.620]  When we come back and start the next hour, Paul Watson's put out a powerful report that's on Infowars.com where they're threatening to arrest former mayor of London because he said there's burqas everywhere, these women have been enslaved, and that Saudi Arabia is trying to get rid of burqas.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:27.326]  We went from, like, trying to pressure Saudi Arabia to stop it, not letting women drive or go to college, and killing them if they poorly looked at another man, to, like, no, it's good!
[00:50:27.326 --> 00:50:31.329]  Teach the children how great it is!
[00:50:31.329 --> 00:50:32.430]  Like, they're talking about banning
[00:50:33.604 --> 00:50:35.626]  The former liberal mayor off Twitter right now.
[00:50:35.626 --> 00:50:40.309]  In fact, the virtue-signalers there at Twitter are talking about it.
[00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:46.975]  So... That's the point that we've gotten to.
[00:50:49.355 --> 00:50:50.596]  As a society and a culture.
[00:50:50.596 --> 00:50:51.817]  But listen.
[00:50:51.817 --> 00:50:56.981]  People say, well why do you even launch an app on iTunes and on Droid?
[00:50:56.981 --> 00:50:57.842]  They're going to censor you.
[00:50:57.842 --> 00:51:00.164]  Because that's where the commerce is.
[00:51:00.164 --> 00:51:01.905]  That's where the ideas are.
[00:51:01.905 --> 00:51:04.407]  That's the open marketplace of ideas.
[00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:15.824]  It's like asking a Jew in Nazi Germany in 1933, why'd you try to go run an office space and be a lawyer or be a mathematician or be a seamstress?
[00:51:15.824 --> 00:51:16.944]  You're like, well that's what I do.
[00:51:16.944 --> 00:51:19.085]  I'm gonna get a little shop and I'm gonna sew clothes.
[00:51:19.085 --> 00:51:21.606]  They're like, you're evil!
[00:51:21.606 --> 00:51:24.426]  You don't get to have a job!
[00:51:24.426 --> 00:51:26.087]  We've been banned off LinkedIn, everything.
[00:51:27.194 --> 00:51:31.675]  They're depersoning us, depersoning us, right on 1984.
[00:51:31.675 --> 00:51:36.016]  And it's being done as the big beta test, and it is a mega, mega, mega outrage.
[00:51:36.016 --> 00:51:43.337]  But they hope it gets lost with all the other outrage, and that Congress doesn't figure it out, and the President doesn't figure it out.
[00:51:43.337 --> 00:51:47.818]  We are under attack by China and the collaborators.
[00:51:47.818 --> 00:51:49.579]  China runs Apple.
[00:51:49.579 --> 00:51:51.679]  Apple has already banned me off platforms.
[00:51:51.679 --> 00:51:55.760]  The Chinese government is silencing American members of the press.
[00:51:57.301 --> 00:52:00.566]  The Chinese government is silencing members of the U.S.
[00:52:00.566 --> 00:52:03.351]  press on record!
[00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:10.242]  They wouldn't even let Michael Savage publish his, he published it, they wouldn't let him put it in stores two years ago about the Chinese takeover of America!
[00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:14.330]  People ask me, how you takin' it being demonized?
[00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:15.770]  How you takin' it being lied about?
[00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:27.635]  How you takin' it being... And I'm like, I'm in a war for the country, with the Chi-Coms, that have killed over 100 million of their own people, 80 plus million under Mao, that openly own Hollywood and our debt, and are trying to silence me?
[00:52:27.635 --> 00:52:31.517]  Soldiers go off and fight and die, usually it's not even for our country, but they mean well?
[00:52:31.517 --> 00:52:37.239]  I'm here fighting for the real nation, against the globalists, for classical free speech.
[00:52:38.533 --> 00:52:40.695]  Of course enemy propaganda has demonized me.
[00:52:40.695 --> 00:52:51.343]  Of course enemy propaganda has twisted who I am and what I've said to then make me a champion of liberty who helped get Trump into office, who helped reboot the Republic, who helped relaunch 1776.
[00:52:51.343 --> 00:52:53.985]  A modern Paul Revere is what Infowars is.
[00:52:53.985 --> 00:52:57.047]  Not me alone, all of us together are modern Paul Reveres.
[00:52:57.047 --> 00:53:02.952]  And they don't like that and they want it shut down and they want it shut down now.
[00:53:02.952 --> 00:53:06.315]  And look at these cowardly, unpopular, stupid twits.
[00:53:07.529 --> 00:53:09.971]  At the New York Times saying, he's been banned.
[00:53:09.971 --> 00:53:11.032]  Should he be banned more?
[00:53:11.032 --> 00:53:12.293]  And people are like, hell no!
[00:53:12.293 --> 00:53:15.956]  We shouldn't be banned at all!
[00:53:15.956 --> 00:53:17.617]  78% say you're totally wrong.
[00:53:17.617 --> 00:53:22.001]  Another 10% say you're pretty much wrong.
[00:53:22.001 --> 00:53:25.244]  They can only get a few percentage points to support me being banned.
[00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:29.207]  That's got to freak them out.
[00:53:29.207 --> 00:53:31.349]  Just because of their own little bubble chambers.
[00:53:32.861 --> 00:53:36.505]  They got into it, doesn't mean everybody else is into it.
[00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:44.353]  So yes, do I have to put myself in the center of the arena and take the most flack and the most fire to do this?
[00:53:44.353 --> 00:53:46.355]  But that was the plan.
[00:53:46.355 --> 00:53:48.517]  And it's not called trolling, it's called being a man.
[00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:50.207]  I feel good.
[00:53:50.207 --> 00:53:51.427]  My morale is good.
[00:53:51.427 --> 00:53:52.488]  I am strong.
[00:53:52.488 --> 00:53:57.571]  The more I'm persecuted, the stronger I get, because I understand it means I'm going into the furnace.
[00:53:57.571 --> 00:54:00.153]  I'm going into the point-blank-range operation.
[00:54:00.153 --> 00:54:01.454]  I'm charging the hell.
[00:54:01.454 --> 00:54:05.136]  I've already taken out 50 machine gun nests, and I'm almost at the top.
[00:54:05.136 --> 00:54:06.197]  We're almost there.
[00:54:06.197 --> 00:54:06.757]  And you know what?
[00:54:06.757 --> 00:54:11.460]  No matter what happens to me, there's millions of people screaming behind me, and we're going over the top.
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.701]  Nothing's stopping us.
[00:54:12.701 --> 00:54:15.883]  And I know that metaphysically and spiritually, and I'm aligned with God.
[00:54:18.513 --> 00:54:21.715]  And I know none of us get out of this alive, so I'm not worried.
[00:54:21.715 --> 00:54:35.183]  Now, they're not going to be able to stay on the app going to number one, so they'll either delist it, like they did when I was number one on Joe Rogan Show, number one podcast in history, they just delisted it.
[00:54:35.183 --> 00:54:37.384]  They'll probably just delist it because it's so embarrassing.
[00:54:37.384 --> 00:54:40.146]  And then like, kick users off, you'll have to resubscribe.
[00:54:40.146 --> 00:54:42.407]  Probably give them ideas, but that's how they operate.
[00:54:42.407 --> 00:54:45.889]  Congressional hearings, though, can subpoena that, and we're moving in that direction.
[00:54:45.889 --> 00:54:46.850]  Being very strategic, though.
[00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:49.643]  Look, we're already number one in just a few days.
[00:54:49.643 --> 00:54:51.645]  It took everybody else years to get up there.
[00:54:51.645 --> 00:54:53.687]  Number one in a couple days.
[00:54:53.687 --> 00:54:54.968]  It backfired again.
[00:54:54.968 --> 00:54:58.892]  So don't worry about the app.
[00:54:58.892 --> 00:55:00.974]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:55:00.974 --> 00:55:03.116]  Go subscribe directly to the podcast.
[00:55:03.116 --> 00:55:04.778]  It's free.
[00:55:04.778 --> 00:55:06.339]  It's free.
[00:55:06.339 --> 00:55:06.920]  It's free.
[00:55:08.306 --> 00:55:09.827]  It's free.
[00:55:09.827 --> 00:55:11.269]  It's free.
[00:55:11.269 --> 00:55:12.850]  Hear what you're not supposed to hear.
[00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:15.332]  And once you download it on Android or App, tell folks about it.
[00:55:15.332 --> 00:55:25.762]  But more importantly, InfoWars.com, 4SlushShow, David Knight's program, Roger Stone and Owen Schroyer's War Room, my broadcast.
[00:55:25.762 --> 00:55:26.282]  It's all there.
[00:55:26.282 --> 00:55:32.368]  And then finally, the biggest thing at the end of the day that fights the bullies, that fights the tyrants, that fights the control freaks,
[00:55:33.775 --> 00:55:36.796]  is what you do when you support us financially.
[00:55:36.796 --> 00:55:38.276]  And you get great products at the same time.
[00:55:38.276 --> 00:55:44.177]  You can make a straight donation at InfoWars.com forward slash store.
[00:55:44.177 --> 00:55:47.178]  Or you just go to InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:55:47.178 --> 00:55:48.158]  You can make a straight up donation.
[00:55:48.158 --> 00:55:48.779]  Those really help.
[00:55:48.779 --> 00:55:49.059]  Thank you.
[00:55:49.059 --> 00:55:50.419]  A lot of donations coming in.
[00:55:50.419 --> 00:55:57.060]  But in the aggregate, it's not like you're getting great products you're going to enjoy, that are going to make your life better, that you then sign up for AutoShip.
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.461]  It's free.
[00:55:57.461 --> 00:55:58.541]  You get an additional 10% off.
[00:56:00.742 --> 00:56:05.219]  We also have free shipping going right now on orders of $10 and up.
[00:56:05.219 --> 00:56:05.842]  In fact, orders of $5.
[00:56:07.188 --> 00:56:08.589]  Free shipping store-wide.
[00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:13.112]  And you can get Winter Sun, Secret 12, DNA Force, 50% off.
[00:56:13.112 --> 00:56:15.313]  Survival Shield X2, 40% off.
[00:56:15.313 --> 00:56:17.154]  Alpha Power is incredible, 50% off.
[00:56:17.154 --> 00:56:34.504]  But if everybody just commits to get the Colloidal Silver Iodine Fortified Fluoride Free Super Blue Toothpaste for adults, children, immune gargle, mouthwash, six different products, if you just get that and sign up for AutoShip and see how great it is, or buy it once, if you like it, sign up for AutoShip, and then get it each month or every 60 or 90 days, however you want.
[00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:38.767]  Cancel any time.
[00:56:38.767 --> 00:56:45.909]  If you just make that financial commitment, get a 360 win and get good products, great products at the same time, you cannot lose.
[00:56:45.909 --> 00:56:47.370]  So get DNA Force.
[00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:57.253]  Experience the PQQ, the BioCoQ10 and all of it at a price and a concentration where it's sold in medical-type deals for $300, $400 right now on discount.
[00:56:57.253 --> 00:56:58.413]  It's $74.95.
[00:56:58.413 --> 00:57:03.275]  That's our big expensive flagship product because there's like 40-something bucks a product in each bottle.
[00:57:03.275 --> 00:57:05.516]  I mean, nobody puts out stuff like this.
[00:57:05.516 --> 00:57:06.256]  This is unbelievable.
[00:57:06.876 --> 00:57:07.336]  X-Tube.
[00:57:07.336 --> 00:57:12.118]  A lot of these products are $19.95, some are $9.95.
[00:57:12.118 --> 00:57:16.619]  But DNA Force is something special and we buy a lot more of it so we're able to lower the price of it from $140 to normally $99.
[00:57:16.619 --> 00:57:20.760]  But right now it is $70 at M4WarsStore.com or M4WarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.961]  They think America's going down without a fight.
[00:57:28.863 --> 00:57:31.344]  They think they're gonna just push us aside easily?
[00:57:31.344 --> 00:57:31.684]  No!
[00:57:31.684 --> 00:57:40.369]  We have victory in our blood, we have destiny in our heart, we have will in our soul, and we will never back down and never get in!
[00:57:40.369 --> 00:57:44.150]  In fact, as they can see, the Warhammer's ready!
[00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:46.912]  We are energizing towards the main collision!
[00:57:50.057 --> 00:57:54.641]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:57:54.641 --> 00:57:55.202]  Thanks for calling.
[00:57:55.202 --> 00:57:56.623]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:57:56.623 --> 00:58:00.307]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[00:58:00.307 --> 00:58:04.991]  I remember back when Infowars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen.
[00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:05.451]  Thank you, bro.
[00:58:25.766 --> 00:58:34.349]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:58:34.349 --> 00:58:39.251]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:44.853]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[00:58:50.418 --> 00:58:56.623]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you- Serious.
[00:58:56.623 --> 00:58:57.523]  But there's no link to them.
[00:58:57.523 --> 00:58:58.364]  Yeah, like Russian collusion?
[00:58:58.364 --> 00:58:59.265]  Russian collusion!
[00:58:59.265 --> 00:59:09.312]  But one would have thought that this open appeal to bigotry, they don't even show what I'm saying, and frequent anti-Semitic dog whistles.
[00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:12.515]  So notice, no links in the New York Times, like we would do in our article.
[00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:15.697]  Like if I said somebody said something anti-Semitic, I would link to it.
[00:59:15.697 --> 00:59:18.960]  I don't agree with being anti-Semitic, you have a right to say it, but they don't show it.
[00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:34.099]  His conspiracy theories are serious, but one would have thought that his open appeals to bigotry and frequent anti-semitism dog whistles would have merited his removal from social media and podcasting platforms long ago.
[00:59:34.099 --> 00:59:41.845]  So because it's the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, I mean, that'd be like if I said the guy that wrote this is a Nazi.
[00:59:41.845 --> 00:59:42.526]  Well, he'd sue me.
[00:59:42.526 --> 00:59:43.726]  I'm not saying he is one.
[00:59:43.726 --> 00:59:48.190]  He says it about me because it's okay because he says it in the New York Times.
[00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:49.391]  I had a New York Times writer here.
[00:59:50.427 --> 00:59:55.616]  And I said, yeah, when I tried to get into the inauguration, they had people blocking the entrance, just beating people up.
[00:59:55.616 --> 00:59:56.658]  She goes, that's not true, I was there.
[00:59:56.658 --> 00:59:57.740]  And she goes, uh-huh.
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.944]  Of course, she knew full well it was all over the news it happened.
[00:59:59.944 --> 01:00:01.206]  I'm sure she agreed with it.
[01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:03.590]  And I said, after I learned that, I said, I'm not talking to you anymore.
[01:00:04.147 --> 01:00:05.468]  I said, I'm never talking to you again.
[01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.569]  Because I already knew.
[01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:07.570]  I never talked to him anyways.
[01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:08.951]  I did it as a test case.
[01:00:08.951 --> 01:00:10.272]  They know it's not true.
[01:00:10.272 --> 01:00:16.778]  They play this weird mind game of gaslighting where they want you to feel alone and weird like their will.
[01:00:16.778 --> 01:00:19.520]  Like, you know, Islam is not oppressive.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.501]  We do not wear burqas.
[01:00:20.501 --> 01:00:22.062]  We do not sexually mutilate women.
[01:00:22.062 --> 01:00:23.483]  Hillary won the election.
[01:00:23.483 --> 01:00:29.008]  And it's this weird, you know, mind control thing of like, no one blocked anyone at the inauguration.
[01:00:29.008 --> 01:00:30.249]  No one came to see Trump.
[01:00:30.569 --> 01:00:35.532]  And I search engine it, and there were even Washington Post, New York Times saying they blocked people, they beat them up.
[01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:42.156]  I was there, but they just attacked us and said it wasn't the case.
[01:00:42.156 --> 01:00:48.880]  Yeah, it's almost like trust is one of the most important things you can have, especially with a media outlet.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.063]  And my slogan was always, I might be wrong, but I'm not lying.
[01:00:53.063 --> 01:00:54.844]  No, I know, but let me ask you that question.
[01:00:54.844 --> 01:00:56.585]  What is this word thing on the left where they'll go?
[01:00:58.632 --> 01:01:00.975]  They'll, like, say something that's true and admit it isn't true.
[01:01:00.975 --> 01:01:04.160]  They'll look at you and smile and go, is this trying to manipulate you or is it?
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.421]  It's compliance training.
[01:01:05.421 --> 01:01:07.404]  It's just like how you train a dog.
[01:01:07.404 --> 01:01:10.388]  Where you say, you know, Caitlyn Jenner is the greatest woman in the world.
[01:01:10.388 --> 01:01:12.431]  Caitlyn, just say it.
[01:01:12.431 --> 01:01:13.893]  It's a purity test for a cult.
[01:01:14.491 --> 01:01:16.973]  Where if you admit to nonsense, they know they own you.
[01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:18.374]  It's how you train animals.
[01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.255]  There's no difference.
[01:01:19.255 --> 01:01:24.079]  So, if someone says, you know, Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:25.060]  Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:25.861]  Admit it.
[01:01:25.861 --> 01:01:28.403]  They're not asking you if you believe Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[01:01:28.403 --> 01:01:29.444]  Everyone knows he's not.
[01:01:29.444 --> 01:01:31.206]  They're just wanting you to submit.
[01:01:31.206 --> 01:01:34.489]  Because they've submitted and that's the power they have.
[01:01:35.211 --> 01:01:35.751]  Exactly.
[01:01:35.751 --> 01:01:39.854]  They want to be able to know that whatever they tell you, you'll agree with.
[01:01:39.854 --> 01:01:42.155]  And that's the leftist mentality.
[01:01:47.907 --> 01:02:07.880]  Oh, it's an always-a-losing mentality, because I was talking to one of my buddies about this recently, where I was like, one thing I love about you is when I bring up a point that you realize is a better point than what you previously believed, you look happy, you look excited, like, thank you for sharpening my sword, whereas a leftist would look threatened and then call you a bigot.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.982]  So, fundamentally, they're only dulling their own weapons.
[01:02:10.982 --> 01:02:13.004]  Oh, all the time I admit I'm wrong.
[01:02:13.004 --> 01:02:14.605]  I'm always trying to learn new stuff.
[01:02:15.505 --> 01:02:18.246]  And you bat a higher percentage than any of these mainstream guys.
[01:02:18.246 --> 01:02:20.086]  I was telling that to Harrison.
[01:02:20.086 --> 01:02:21.206]  I'm buddies with Harrison.
[01:02:21.206 --> 01:02:33.490]  I was telling him, if you go back in time, if you go six months, a year, in a lot of your shows, that's probably one reason why they wanted to wipe the slate, is you're more accurate than they want to admit.
[01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:41.812]  And at first, sometimes you hear things and they sound jarring, and then you see time play out and you're like, wow, it really did go to China, huh?
[01:02:41.812 --> 01:02:42.512]  That's wild.
[01:02:43.257 --> 01:02:45.518]  Let's do five more minutes and talk about that.
[01:02:45.518 --> 01:02:50.100]  35,000 videos, 2.5 billion views, 2.5 million subscribers.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.981]  Like, to use a Star Wars analogy, like Alderaan.
[01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:55.022]  Blown into bits.
[01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:55.622]  Destroyed.
[01:02:55.622 --> 01:02:55.942]  Gone.
[01:02:55.942 --> 01:02:57.843]  And they just are so pleased.
[01:02:57.843 --> 01:03:03.125]  And the New York Times smiles and says, Alex, nobody attacked protesters.
[01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:03.786]  Nobody.
[01:03:03.786 --> 01:03:05.586]  Nobody blocked Trump, people.
[01:03:05.586 --> 01:03:06.567]  You're a liar.
[01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:07.927]  And they smile.
[01:03:07.927 --> 01:03:09.008]  We got your kids.
[01:03:10.293 --> 01:03:18.817]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalist and live in a free society.
[01:03:18.817 --> 01:03:22.318]  Several years ago I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:15.033]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:04:15.033 --> 01:04:23.957]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:04:23.957 --> 01:04:29.299]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:37.562]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[01:04:37.682 --> 01:04:38.162]  I'm good to go.
[01:05:12.572 --> 01:05:15.197]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:30.491]  Big Brother.
[01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:32.294]  Mainstream media.
[01:05:32.294 --> 01:05:34.157]  Government cover-ups.
[01:05:34.157 --> 01:05:35.879]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:05:35.879 --> 01:05:37.542]  Well, so does he.
[01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:42.229]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:49.882]  Your powers are weak.
[01:05:49.882 --> 01:05:51.182]  You can't win, Darth.
[01:05:51.182 --> 01:05:55.564]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[01:05:55.564 --> 01:05:56.824]  You should not come back!
[01:06:18.117 --> 01:06:28.386]  All right.
[01:06:29.355 --> 01:06:33.659]  During the break, as I can't stop doing it, there's literally articles published every 30 seconds.
[01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:37.142]  Fox News has come out and said I should be banned, and doesn't show what I said or did.
[01:06:37.142 --> 01:06:39.985]  Because News Corp, most of them want to get rid of their competition.
[01:06:39.985 --> 01:06:44.609]  There's this corporatist attitude of these big corporations that can't compete, they want to do this.
[01:06:44.609 --> 01:06:49.554]  Owen Benjamin of HugePianist.com, that's a person who plays the piano,
[01:06:50.709 --> 01:06:56.594]  Where do you think it ends and why do you think Jack Dorsey came out and said, oh actually we're not banning Alex Jones yet.
[01:06:56.594 --> 01:06:57.955]  He hasn't violated our rules.
[01:06:57.955 --> 01:07:05.440]  Then he came to his crew and he said, well maybe we should reach outside of our platform and judge people who are on our platform by what they say outside.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.762]  This sounds pretty creepy.
[01:07:07.762 --> 01:07:09.463]  Yeah, it's very creepy.
[01:07:09.463 --> 01:07:15.428]  Sometimes I think a lot of this are just the sounds of dying dinosaurs that the wounded deer jumps highest because
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:25.065]  It's almost like in middle school or high school when you had that cool group, but then they just kept excluding people, like the mean girls, until it's just one person.
[01:07:25.065 --> 01:07:30.348]  I think that the leftist media narcissism is going to end up making it so they're just alone.
[01:07:30.348 --> 01:07:34.530]  You know, like Stephen Colbert, I think their ratings are lower than some of my live streams.
[01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:38.212]  So they're just going to be talking to themselves in some creepy little dungeon.
[01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:40.330]  And it's really happening.
[01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:44.532]  I mean, they paid $18 million for this new Anderson Cooper show.
[01:07:44.532 --> 01:07:50.755]  And one of my live streams, even censored, that I do on Saturday morning, you know, have 100,000, 200,000 views.
[01:07:50.755 --> 01:07:52.316]  His has like 50,000 views.
[01:07:52.316 --> 01:07:54.737]  5,000 is the peak at one time.
[01:07:54.737 --> 01:08:02.441]  $18 million being force-fed with notices, hey, Anderson Cooper, the Vanderbilt's on.
[01:08:02.441 --> 01:08:04.722]  No one wants to watch it.
[01:08:04.722 --> 01:08:05.762]  No one wants to watch it.
[01:08:07.639 --> 01:08:13.580]  I love the term astroturfing, the fake grassroots, where they have all this money.
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:21.462]  They have so much money to promote all this nonsense, and so they'll get the sheep to come in, but no one will stay.
[01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:29.504]  It's one of those McMansions, one of these big houses built on just a horrible frame, and it just falls over.
[01:08:30.467 --> 01:08:36.891]  It's kind of funny, you know, I've been through this so much and I had so much fear with it when it first happened.
[01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:39.852]  You know, even Patreon said they were going to shut down my Patreon.
[01:08:39.852 --> 01:08:45.996]  And these are people, these are American citizens who just choose to give me a donation to keep free speech comedy going.
[01:08:45.996 --> 01:08:46.456]  Exactly.
[01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:57.623]  Why do people think it's cool to censor and cool to join the corporates when the corporates, when you like join them in a bubble, they don't pat you on the head, but it's just like feeling like you're part of the big power.
[01:08:58.223 --> 01:08:58.944]  Just fear.
[01:08:58.944 --> 01:09:05.609]  It's these people, yeah exactly, it's power over truth and it's just people that have been overcome by bitterness.
[01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:21.463]  You know, and that's why I really don't think it'll happen in America because we're, a lot of people living in America, our ancestors were the ones who wouldn't deal with that and came here and so we're kind of spawned from people that are... So you're saying the genetic memory is going to kick in?
[01:09:22.165 --> 01:09:29.409]  Yeah, and unlike Europe, we didn't lose 60 million of our alpha males in two world wars in a 30 year span.
[01:09:29.409 --> 01:09:31.009]  More than Napoleonic before that.
[01:09:31.009 --> 01:09:32.190]  That's Europe's big problem.
[01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:33.751]  I'm not being mean to Europe.
[01:09:33.751 --> 01:09:35.452]  They were just as tough as us or tougher.
[01:09:35.452 --> 01:09:37.793]  They wiped all their alpha males out.
[01:09:37.793 --> 01:09:41.595]  You know Frenchmen used to be bigger than Englishmen or Germans?
[01:09:41.595 --> 01:09:44.196]  Yeah, they were real tough guys and now they're all dead.
[01:09:44.196 --> 01:09:44.917]  They're all dead.
[01:09:44.917 --> 01:09:46.898]  They were all like Viking killers.
[01:09:46.898 --> 01:09:47.678]  They were all killed.
[01:09:48.615 --> 01:10:02.682]  Yeah, that's why the ones that bailed in like the 17-1800s to come to America, like a lot of people that we're related to, uh... Well, when you go to areas of French Canada, there's like six foot four big French guys that are like, they're the ones that didn't get killed.
[01:10:02.682 --> 01:10:06.124]  Yeah, but now they have Justin Trudeau to deal with.
[01:10:06.124 --> 01:10:08.205]  Who says don't say mother or father?
[01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:09.865]  No, that's hate speech.
[01:10:09.865 --> 01:10:10.526]  How dare you?
[01:10:10.526 --> 01:10:12.246]  Ellen Benjamin, join us again.
[01:10:12.246 --> 01:10:12.907]  You're amazing.
[01:10:12.907 --> 01:10:13.607]  God bless you.
[01:10:13.607 --> 01:10:16.469]  HugePianist.com.
[01:10:16.469 --> 01:10:17.109]  Thank you so much.
[01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:19.325]  We knew it was coming.
[01:10:19.325 --> 01:10:20.765]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:10:20.765 --> 01:10:35.012]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia, and then voila!
[01:10:35.012 --> 01:10:45.057]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:10:45.057 --> 01:10:45.958]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:10:46.778 --> 01:10:47.158]  I think so.
[01:11:08.386 --> 01:11:11.088]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[01:11:11.088 --> 01:11:16.191]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[01:11:16.191 --> 01:11:23.817]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:11:23.817 --> 01:11:25.698]  Coming to you live from America.
[01:11:27.179 --> 01:11:29.722]  In the middle of a civil war against the global.
[01:11:29.722 --> 01:11:41.053]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:11:41.053 --> 01:11:44.055]  They think you're a goldfish!
[01:11:44.055 --> 01:11:46.398]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[01:11:46.398 --> 01:11:47.359]  I believe in you!
[01:11:47.359 --> 01:11:49.000]  I don't think you're stupid!
[01:11:51.659 --> 01:11:55.863]  One man, emirates a woman, old genitals were cut off!
[01:11:55.863 --> 01:11:58.425]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[01:11:58.425 --> 01:12:00.908]  And we're not backing down ever!
[01:12:00.908 --> 01:12:02.749]  I wanna get these people!
[01:12:02.749 --> 01:12:03.310]  We're winning!
[01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:04.571]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:05.332]  Can't you?
[01:12:05.332 --> 01:12:07.313]  We have broken their back!
[01:12:07.313 --> 01:12:12.338]  Yes, I can feel it!
[01:12:12.338 --> 01:12:12.878]  Let's go!
[01:12:14.252 --> 01:12:24.314]  C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
[01:12:24.314 --> 01:12:26.595]  Vengeance is coming!
[01:12:26.595 --> 01:12:28.736]  Fire is coming!
[01:12:28.736 --> 01:12:32.716]  The real revolution against you is coming!
[01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:34.817]  And you will burn in hell!
[01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:41.318]  All right, I had some fun there, and that's my, you know, not my normal self there having some fun.
[01:12:41.318 --> 01:12:47.963]  But Doug Hagman is joining us of the Hagman Report, and so much more he's going to take over the next hour.
[01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:55.729]  But now you can see the full assault on free speech, misrepresenting what we said and done to build the strawman to take us all out.
[01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:57.630]  Why does Jack Dorsey not ban us?
[01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:58.491]  Everybody else has.
[01:12:58.491 --> 01:12:59.872]  The media is all celebrating.
[01:13:00.862 --> 01:13:06.645]  Because they're all dependent on mainstream media, they're all dependent on the social networks saying, oh Jones is over, Jones is dead.
[01:13:06.645 --> 01:13:10.987]  I explained this to you idiots in establishment media before.
[01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:16.629]  They'd already shadow banned us 90 plus percent on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:19.631]  So I openly poked the bear.
[01:13:21.181 --> 01:13:38.745]  Not to get them to ban us, just so that it would trigger an accelerated event to have a debate ahead of the election about the fact that you're letting the leftist and the globalist and the islamicist all have free reign, but Americans and patriots and Christians and free marketers are all being censored.
[01:13:38.745 --> 01:13:41.286]  And it's all coming to a head right now.
[01:13:42.048 --> 01:13:43.910]  So it's an epic time to be alive.
[01:13:43.910 --> 01:14:00.865]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, the power of you going and getting the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app on Droid or on iPhone has already sent us a number one on news on both platforms and in the top
[01:14:02.254 --> 01:14:05.158]  30 to 60, depending on where you're at, in total apps globally.
[01:14:05.158 --> 01:14:06.980]  We just launched this three weeks ago.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.802]  We thought the purge was coming.
[01:14:08.802 --> 01:14:12.746]  And I even thought it'll be nice to see them get upset when you sent it to number one.
[01:14:12.746 --> 01:14:15.810]  But more importantly, InfoWars.com.
[01:14:17.307 --> 01:14:36.635]  Infowars.com forward slash show has where you can subscribe directly with us, not with Android, not with a shy comrade on Apple, with Cook openly working for them, but the Alex Jones Show, The Real News with David Knight, The Warren with Owen Schroer, and others like Roger Stone.
[01:14:36.635 --> 01:14:38.416]  So that's really where the fight is.
[01:14:38.416 --> 01:14:41.097]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:14:41.097 --> 01:14:42.538]  We have no comments.
[01:14:42.538 --> 01:14:43.298]  Discuss us.
[01:14:43.298 --> 01:14:44.779]  We've used for eight years.
[01:14:44.779 --> 01:14:45.159]  Band us.
[01:14:46.409 --> 01:14:49.911]  Um, WebChimp, we've been using for seven, eight years, banned us.
[01:14:49.911 --> 01:14:53.774]  They're hitting our DNSs, they're hacking us right now, they're attacking us.
[01:14:53.774 --> 01:14:55.355]  People say, oh my God, you should give up.
[01:14:55.355 --> 01:14:59.878]  No, I'm under attack because I'm over the target.
[01:14:59.878 --> 01:15:03.120]  And so, if they're successful, I don't do false flags.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.964]  I can step back and have the engineers, like in a Star Trek thing with smoke coming out, trying to keep it going and say, go eat lunch.
[01:15:08.964 --> 01:15:09.905]  We'd be down right now.
[01:15:10.956 --> 01:15:14.380]  So then being up here 18 hours, two days ago, right?
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.601]  They're cross-eyed.
[01:15:15.601 --> 01:15:18.604]  I can step back and say, you boys go home and see your wives and children.
[01:15:18.604 --> 01:15:20.186]  We'd be down right now.
[01:15:20.186 --> 01:15:21.787]  I can say, oh my God, they took us down.
[01:15:21.787 --> 01:15:22.668]  But see, I don't do that.
[01:15:22.668 --> 01:15:24.310]  I don't fight dirty.
[01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:27.373]  We're going to fight to the end, but we may go down the next few days.
[01:15:27.373 --> 01:15:28.194]  They're hitting us.
[01:15:28.194 --> 01:15:28.935]  You couldn't imagine.
[01:15:30.612 --> 01:15:31.132]  We're here.
[01:15:31.132 --> 01:15:32.053]  We're trying to hold it up.
[01:15:32.053 --> 01:15:33.734]  We don't make a big deal out of it.
[01:15:33.734 --> 01:15:36.636]  But it's not just, oh, take me off these corporations, whatever.
[01:15:36.636 --> 01:15:45.481]  They're taking us down everywhere because, just like they just busted 12 kids trained for mass shootings, just like the left's getting ready to move, they don't want us reaching a general audience.
[01:15:46.733 --> 01:15:47.793]  Ahead of a big event.
[01:15:47.793 --> 01:16:00.638]  That's my intel, and I can't wait to hear our guest host, Doug Hagman, police and investigative trainer, best-selling author, researcher, great political mind, helped break some of the biggest news in 2016 about the pedophile rings.
[01:16:00.638 --> 01:16:09.281]  Clearly, I think, I love to make it about Infowars, but I gotta tell you, they're just trying to silence us, I think, Doug, ahead of something really big and them making their move.
[01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:10.122]  What's your intel?
[01:16:10.122 --> 01:16:10.682]  Go ahead and take over.
[01:16:12.342 --> 01:16:13.283]  Alex, thank you very much.
[01:16:13.283 --> 01:16:15.505]  By the way, congratulations on your app.
[01:16:15.505 --> 01:16:18.769]  We've all downloaded it here at the office and it's marvelous.
[01:16:18.769 --> 01:16:21.191]  It's a great thing.
[01:16:21.191 --> 01:16:24.054]  As a matter of fact, one more thing before you run out.
[01:16:24.054 --> 01:16:31.522]  I just want to tell you that we have a mutual friend I spoke with yesterday and right after Matt Drudge visited your studios,
[01:16:33.087 --> 01:16:34.108]  He had a conversation.
[01:16:34.108 --> 01:16:35.349]  He's also a friend with Matt Drudge.
[01:16:35.349 --> 01:16:39.093]  He had a conversation with Mr. Drudge.
[01:16:39.093 --> 01:16:56.248]  Matt Drudge had said that the reason that Alex Jones is so popular and would be the first to be targeted, and I quote this, and I wrote this down when I was speaking with this gentleman, is that Alex Jones and Infowars has the pulse of the nation.
[01:16:56.795 --> 01:16:58.495]  in their finger on the pulse of the nation.
[01:16:58.495 --> 01:17:10.258]  So, that's what makes you so, makes Infowars and you so dangerous, is because you're plugged into that pulse that's representative of our republic.
[01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:11.198]  So, great job on that.
[01:17:11.198 --> 01:17:12.478]  Can you not feel the pulse?
[01:17:12.478 --> 01:17:14.918]  Like it's electric, like you feel America coming back.
[01:17:14.918 --> 01:17:17.759]  It's spiritual, it's like boom, boom, boom.
[01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:18.659]  That's what they're scared of.
[01:17:18.659 --> 01:17:20.299]  And they think they shut me down?
[01:17:20.299 --> 01:17:21.440]  That makes, oh no, no, no.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.540]  This is, worldwide people are awakening.
[01:17:24.386 --> 01:17:26.289]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:26.289 --> 01:17:29.032]  We're battling on a number of planes here.
[01:17:29.032 --> 01:17:37.744]  Obviously, you've got the sporadic political violence, you've got the economic aspects, you've got the political warfare, but this, the censorship or the banning, I should say,
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:47.087]  Is being done ahead of and you're exactly right ahead of the 20 midterm elections and of course the event well in advance of the 2020 elections.
[01:17:47.087 --> 01:17:52.192]  The message that you carry, the message that InfoWars carries and we carry is must be silenced.
[01:17:52.192 --> 01:17:57.918]  They can't refute the facts so they got to silence, they got to take down InfoWars or shut them off, ban them, whatever.
[01:17:57.918 --> 01:18:00.200]  That's the reason because they can't argue facts.
[01:18:01.317 --> 01:18:05.139]  Well, you're taking over and hosting, but clearly they're making their move.
[01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:08.921]  And I've been told by sources that they have Islamic training camps all over the U.S.
[01:18:08.921 --> 01:18:09.841]  We know about some of them.
[01:18:09.841 --> 01:18:10.802]  We've covered them.
[01:18:10.802 --> 01:18:18.826]  The left attacks us when we cover it, but this bust of 12 kids trained for school shootings, you can see them getting ready to trigger this, everything else.
[01:18:18.826 --> 01:18:21.507]  They want us off the air for something big.
[01:18:21.507 --> 01:18:22.408]  Doug, what is it?
[01:18:23.775 --> 01:18:25.315]  Well, I think it's a combination of things.
[01:18:25.315 --> 01:18:34.377]  Number one, if you're calling out the, again, the sporadic politically charged violence.
[01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:35.938]  But it's something much bigger than that.
[01:18:35.938 --> 01:18:39.719]  And I think it's all part of this ongoing civil war.
[01:18:39.719 --> 01:18:41.479]  It's a component of the civil war.
[01:18:41.479 --> 01:18:48.040]  The New Mexico compound figures dramatically in this.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.521]  I was on your show, I was on InfoWars.
[01:18:52.044 --> 01:19:05.053]  Oh my goodness, a couple of, I think probably now a month ago, maybe a month and a half ago, with Dr. Paul L. Williams, we were talking about the investigation that I conducted into Islamberg, which is the Muslims of the Americas, headed by Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani.
[01:19:05.883 --> 01:19:08.424]  And the deal with that is this.
[01:19:08.424 --> 01:19:13.767]  The CIA basically brought Jelani into the United States back in 1980.
[01:19:13.767 --> 01:19:15.647]  Or at least it was on their dime.
[01:19:15.647 --> 01:19:17.388]  And he set up shop in Brooklyn.
[01:19:17.388 --> 01:19:24.351]  And Sheikh Mubarak Jelani began what is known as the Muslims of the Americas or the Community of the Impoverished.
[01:19:24.351 --> 01:19:26.492]  It's known as the Jamaat al-Fuqra.
[01:19:26.492 --> 01:19:30.594]  And for a while, it was on the terrorist watch list in the United States.
[01:19:31.798 --> 01:19:43.881]  Well, it was after 9-11, and it was after the events that they're in, 2003, 4, 5, in that time period.
[01:19:43.881 --> 01:20:01.185]  I had conducted surveillance of an Islamic training camp that we've talked about on this show, folks, and I've disclosed, and of course, the focus of which, the training compounds, at least primarily, were the Muslims of the Americans, Jamal al-Fukhra, headed by this Pakistani sheikh.
[01:20:02.341 --> 01:20:12.144]  Well, we saw yesterday, what we saw breaking the news yesterday, this New Mexico compound is connected directly to the Muslims of the Americas.
[01:20:12.144 --> 01:20:15.125]  It's connected to the various compounds all across the United States.
[01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:20.127]  This, of course, is a very small version of the larger ones out there.
[01:20:20.127 --> 01:20:22.988]  And what was taking place is there's a recruitment drive.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.623]  of black Muslims in prisons all across the United States.
[01:20:26.623 --> 01:20:27.464]  I've documented this.
[01:20:27.464 --> 01:20:29.287]  I've sent this to the FBI.
[01:20:29.287 --> 01:20:30.828]  I had sent this to the FBI back in 2007, 2007, 2008, I believe it was.
[01:20:35.769 --> 01:20:39.070]  Uh, based on my own personal observations.
[01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:44.111]  In fact, InfoWars had, you can go back in the archives, well, no.
[01:20:44.111 --> 01:20:56.954]  InfoWars had shown the school buses on the property in Hancock, New York, where the school bus was being used for training, military-style training, paramilitary-style training.
[01:20:56.954 --> 01:21:04.356]  And, uh, gotta tell you, it was, uh, this is a smaller version of that.
[01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:16.933]  So, the bottom line is, uh, what we're seeing right now is, is this, is this, uh, refinement, if you will.

[01:25:31.225 --> 01:25:36.250]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:37.772]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:25:43.190 --> 01:25:45.451]  This is Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:25:45.451 --> 01:25:50.232]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, sitting in for AlexInfoWars.com.
[01:25:50.232 --> 01:25:53.913]  Folks, I kind of stopped abruptly at that last segment.
[01:25:53.913 --> 01:25:57.914]  I'm going to get into the New Mexico compound because I think that's so important.
[01:25:57.914 --> 01:26:03.236]  And Alex made some great points about the Muslim training compounds and about this particular story.
[01:26:03.236 --> 01:26:04.276]  And folks, you
[01:26:05.323 --> 01:26:21.398]  We're told about this, the people who listen to InfoWars.com and of course my platform HagenReport.com, we had told you about the threat of Islamists in this country preparing to make war at a given time and I had sent a report to the FBI as a matter of fact
[01:26:22.105 --> 01:26:29.312]  This is, during the break, this is a copy, if you're watching this, this is the exact copy of what I sent to the FBI.
[01:26:29.312 --> 01:26:41.262]  This is just the text of my report, not including the video as well as the photographic evidence that I took of these training compounds.
[01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:43.624]  And the date on that was February 12th of 2006.
[01:26:43.624 --> 01:26:44.605]  And we've talked about that on this show.
[01:26:48.462 --> 01:27:04.488]  But before I get into that, I want to use this segment here just to talk about the subject that's really on everybody's mind, on everybody's lips, and that's the censorship or the banning, more appropriate or more accurately, the banning of InfoWars.
[01:27:04.488 --> 01:27:13.492]  And the way I look at it is we're right now, we're at a time when the dominant form of speech in this nation is carried by private companies.
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:19.622]  And what we saw this week is these private companies moving in lockstep.
[01:27:19.622 --> 01:27:21.743]  Now consider this.
[01:27:21.743 --> 01:27:28.945]  It's effectively just as bad when you have got private companies moving in lockstep with one another.
[01:27:28.945 --> 01:27:32.526]  It is effectively just as bad as government-controlled speech, is it not?
[01:27:32.526 --> 01:27:34.727]  Because the result is effectively the same.
[01:27:34.727 --> 01:27:35.688]  It's essentially the same.
[01:27:35.688 --> 01:27:36.768]  This is exactly what we saw.
[01:27:37.987 --> 01:27:43.932]  When I took a look at this, and we knew this was coming, Alex knew this was coming, just didn't have a when.
[01:27:43.932 --> 01:27:47.936]  He kind of know when the bombs are on their way.
[01:27:47.936 --> 01:27:51.839]  He just don't know exactly, precisely when they're going to hit.
[01:27:51.839 --> 01:28:04.430]  But when you look at this, and when you start taking away, peeling back the layers of this onion, you've got Apple, you've got Facebook, you've got Spotify, YouTube, which is an alphabet Google company, of course.
[01:28:05.456 --> 01:28:09.439]  They all banned InfoWars, and I consider this within a 12-hour period.
[01:28:09.439 --> 01:28:29.574]  And I looked into this, I did my own investigation, and when I looked at this, when you consider the timing and consider how they were all banned in a matter of 12 hours, the only conclusion that you can come up with, that any reasonable person can come up with, was that this was a coordinated attack.
[01:28:29.574 --> 01:28:31.536]  It was coordinated.
[01:28:31.536 --> 01:28:34.578]  And when you, okay, looking at it a step further,
[01:28:36.502 --> 01:28:53.329]  The issue really isn't that InfoWars was banned by these private companies, although it is, I guess, but it was the method in which it was done by these four unbelievably powerful companies working in concert within the span of 12 hours.
[01:28:53.329 --> 01:29:01.412]  When you look at the net value of these companies, where you've got Apple, a trillion dollar value, when you've got Google, $850 billion.
[01:29:03.443 --> 01:29:08.927]  You've got Facebook at $500 billion or half a trillion dollars.
[01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:13.890]  You've got Spotify at $32 billion.
[01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:22.495]  Doing the math, and assuming I did this correctly, you've got $2.4 trillion in those companies alone.
[01:29:22.495 --> 01:29:32.422]  Consider that there are only seven countries in the world with a gross domestic product that have a similar value or the influence that that GDP would carry.
[01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:42.346]  Those four tech companies have exercised what appears to be effectively the sovereign power.
[01:29:43.889 --> 01:29:48.874]  So, look at it a little bit differently than perhaps we've looked at it before.
[01:29:48.874 --> 01:29:56.021]  And I know that the phrase as well, it's an antitrust issue come in.
[01:29:56.021 --> 01:30:02.527]  There are a lot of different, I've heard so much over the last couple of days, because we have a stake in this as well.
[01:30:02.527 --> 01:30:04.549]  We are being banned as well.
[01:30:04.549 --> 01:30:05.350]  And you know what?
[01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:06.951]  You're next.
[01:30:06.951 --> 01:30:07.772]  And about that.
[01:30:09.297 --> 01:30:20.440]  I've seen so many people say, well, I don't use Facebook, or I quit using Twitter, or I just don't bother with the social networking, so it really doesn't affect me.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.961]  Or, I don't listen to Infowars.
[01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:25.901]  And you know all of the stories.
[01:30:25.901 --> 01:30:28.822]  You know all of the general stories.
[01:30:28.822 --> 01:30:32.923]  Consider that the Jews did not have to listen to Hitler's radio speeches.
[01:30:32.923 --> 01:30:35.764]  They didn't have to listen to his rants.
[01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.704]  The problem, when you consider it,
[01:30:38.524 --> 01:30:41.066]  The Germans were listening.
[01:30:41.066 --> 01:30:46.690]  And what do we have today with the claims of Nazism and what have you?
[01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:48.772]  We've got a very similar situation.
[01:30:48.772 --> 01:30:55.457]  I'm not talking about the Holocaust.
[01:30:55.457 --> 01:31:05.665]  I'm talking about the parallels to the society, today's society, with the sovereign power
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.843]  That these four companies actually have amassed.
[01:31:10.843 --> 01:31:16.468]  And again, the excuse, well, I don't use them or this doesn't affect me, it's not going to wash.
[01:31:16.468 --> 01:31:20.230]  And the Nuremberg defense is not going to work.
[01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:26.595]  But I want to take you back a little bit, just a little bit ago, as I conclude this segment here.
[01:31:26.595 --> 01:31:28.797]  I'm going to take you back in time.
[01:31:28.797 --> 01:31:33.981]  Remember, in 2009, right after the election, Cass Sunstein,
[01:31:34.759 --> 01:31:43.943]  Obama appointed Cass Sunstein as the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs officer.
[01:31:43.943 --> 01:31:45.403]  I want to make sure I got that right.
[01:31:45.403 --> 01:31:47.004]  However brief, brief in time.
[01:31:47.004 --> 01:31:49.945]  The intent was there.
[01:31:49.945 --> 01:32:00.029]  Okay, the plans for this kind of censorship or this kind of banning or this kind of making the evolution of fake news began with Obama.
[01:32:00.029 --> 01:32:01.130]  It began back in 2008 after his election.
[01:32:04.793 --> 01:32:11.036]  And what we're seeing today is the payback, if you will, to the 2016 elections.
[01:32:11.036 --> 01:32:12.837]  I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
[01:32:12.837 --> 01:32:19.300]  I'm just kind of prefacing everything with the information I think is important because when you look back in time...
[01:32:20.416 --> 01:32:33.424]  After the 2009 appointment of Cass Sunstein, and remember Cass Sunstein, who he is, in my view, a communist as well, married to Samantha Power, of the unmasking fame.
[01:32:33.424 --> 01:32:34.984]  You think that this is a coincidence?
[01:32:34.984 --> 01:32:36.645]  I think not.
[01:32:36.645 --> 01:32:38.566]  But let's fast forward from 2009 to 2011.
[01:32:38.566 --> 01:32:44.670]  In 2011, on February 17th, there was a photograph that was floating around the internet.
[01:32:45.698 --> 01:32:57.829]  And I don't know if it can be brought up, but it was a February 17, 2011 meeting with many of the tech giants in San Francisco.
[01:32:57.829 --> 01:33:11.762]  It was a February 27, 2011 meeting in San Francisco, where at that time, the CEOs of Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook, Google, before it became Alphabet, Netflix, Oracle Systems, and I could go on, all met
[01:33:12.765 --> 01:33:41.054]  Unprecedented with Obama and Valerie Jarrett and I assert it was at that meeting that they became to a an agreement of sorts or laid out the groundwork for what we're seeing today because what we're seeing today is not a product of the Donald Trump administration but a product of the holdovers via Obama allowing this or more more accurately coordinating
[01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:46.961]  This government's sentiment of the Obama holdovers with the private companies.
[01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:51.586]  I'm not saying the government did this, I'm saying that elements within the government did this.
[01:33:51.586 --> 01:33:55.329]  And there's a picture, if you're watching this live, there's a picture on the screen.
[01:33:55.329 --> 01:34:02.396]  So that's why history is so important and it's so interesting how history gets revised.
[01:34:02.396 --> 01:34:05.479]  And that's why they don't want you, the deep state does not want you.
[01:34:06.428 --> 01:34:07.288]  To no history.
[01:34:07.288 --> 01:34:09.890]  Folks, you're listening to Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:11.030]  InfoWars.com.
[01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:12.591]  Sitting in Doug Agnew, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:34:12.591 --> 01:34:14.072]  Don't forget, folks.
[01:34:14.072 --> 01:34:17.153]  Visit Alex Jones or visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:17.153 --> 01:34:20.495]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[01:34:20.495 --> 01:34:23.316]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[01:34:23.316 --> 01:34:24.877]  Get a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[01:34:25.217 --> 01:34:30.259]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[01:34:30.259 --> 01:34:33.540]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:39.822]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[01:34:39.822 --> 01:34:49.346]  Sunny Bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work, and have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[01:34:49.346 --> 01:34:50.366]  Why take another pill?
[01:34:50.766 --> 01:34:55.007]  Many people use our Sunny Bay Heating Pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[01:34:55.007 --> 01:34:59.768]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[01:34:59.768 --> 01:35:02.989]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:08.210]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.

[01:35:11.190 --> 01:35:14.771]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[01:35:17.981 --> 01:35:25.679]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:35:25.679 --> 01:35:26.140]  It's you!
[01:35:27.259 --> 01:35:29.441]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:35:29.441 --> 01:35:38.168]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:35:38.168 --> 01:35:42.752]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:35:42.752 --> 01:35:44.194]  You are the info war.
[01:35:44.194 --> 01:35:47.717]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:35:48.397 --> 01:35:59.782]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:35:59.782 --> 01:36:07.766]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:36:07.766 --> 01:36:14.810]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:17.551]  We are the renaissance and we are winning!
[01:36:17.851 --> 01:36:24.334]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[01:36:24.334 --> 01:36:31.157]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[01:36:31.157 --> 01:36:46.685]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[01:36:47.853 --> 01:36:51.676]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:36:51.676 --> 01:36:56.919]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[01:36:56.919 --> 01:36:58.220]  And here's the best part.
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:00.061]  It is absolutely free.
[01:37:00.061 --> 01:37:05.265]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[01:37:05.265 --> 01:37:09.227]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:37:09.227 --> 01:37:13.350]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:17.453]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:37:18.073 --> 01:37:19.415]  We knew it was coming.
[01:37:19.415 --> 01:37:20.856]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:37:20.856 --> 01:37:34.889]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia, and then voila!
[01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:45.181]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds.
[01:37:45.181 --> 01:37:54.032]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[01:37:54.733 --> 01:38:04.175]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[01:38:04.175 --> 01:38:16.298]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[01:38:16.298 --> 01:38:17.578]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:38:21.011 --> 01:38:34.461]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:38:34.461 --> 01:38:37.103]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:38:37.103 --> 01:38:39.764]  It's time for you to choose a side.
[01:38:39.764 --> 01:38:42.086]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:38:46.639 --> 01:38:48.560]  Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.962]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:38:51.962 --> 01:38:57.265]  By the way, if you haven't done so already, support this movement.
[01:38:57.265 --> 01:39:03.549]  And really, it's a movement, it's a great American movement that the giant has awakened.
[01:39:04.169 --> 01:39:04.570]  I think?
[01:39:22.096 --> 01:39:23.177]  Plus free shipping.
[01:39:39.145 --> 01:39:42.866]  There are no spectators in the fight that we find ourselves.
[01:39:42.866 --> 01:39:43.586]  None.
[01:39:43.586 --> 01:39:57.150]  You're either for us, meaning the people who are for free speech, for open dialogue, or you're against us, meaning you are a really a fascist or someone who supports fascism.
[01:39:57.150 --> 01:40:00.911]  Because we are seeing this communist type activity, which is
[01:40:01.832 --> 01:40:06.615]  Which is really just a different word for fascism and Nazism.
[01:40:06.615 --> 01:40:08.936]  They're all of the same cloth, really.
[01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:11.678]  They're just different threads of the same cloth.
[01:40:11.678 --> 01:40:19.483]  That's contrary, of course, to what they want you to believe, that Nazism, for example, is from the extreme right.
[01:40:19.483 --> 01:40:20.083]  No, no, no, no.
[01:40:20.083 --> 01:40:22.545]  It's all on the extreme left, if you study history.
[01:40:22.545 --> 01:40:24.346]  And that's why they don't want you to study history.
[01:40:24.346 --> 01:40:29.789]  But again, Survival Shield, Alpha Power, all of the products
[01:40:30.928 --> 01:40:32.309]  Get some skin in the game.
[01:40:32.309 --> 01:40:33.330]  Put some skin in the game.
[01:40:33.330 --> 01:40:38.975]  Support InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and take part in the specials.
[01:40:38.975 --> 01:40:40.797]  You'll feel better, too, on top of all that.
[01:40:40.797 --> 01:40:45.201]  Now, last segment, which I couldn't for the life of me come up with a title for.
[01:40:45.201 --> 01:40:49.104]  I want to thank the fine folks at InfoWars for helping me out on that.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:54.503]  I was talking about the history, really, how we got here.
[01:40:54.503 --> 01:41:08.372]  And don't forget, it was Cass Sunstein back in 2009, and then there was that infamous but downplayed meeting in 2011, February 17, 2011, in San Francisco, with all of the tech giants, along with Obama.
[01:41:08.372 --> 01:41:11.334]  And isn't it interesting now?
[01:41:11.334 --> 01:41:17.718]  And I believe it was during that period of time that there was this gentleman's agreement, or this agreement of sorts,
[01:41:18.591 --> 01:41:18.952]  I think?
[01:41:48.994 --> 01:42:00.818]  But, currently we see that the leftists, the establishment, the deep state, they're labeling anyone who disagrees with them as hate speech.
[01:42:00.818 --> 01:42:04.059]  And this, as Alex has said, look at the timing of this.
[01:42:04.059 --> 01:42:08.600]  90 days right now, 89 days, 90 days before the midterm elections.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:09.881]  Is that a coincidence?
[01:42:09.881 --> 01:42:11.301]  I think not.
[01:42:11.301 --> 01:42:14.102]  They cannot win in the free market of ideas.
[01:42:15.895 --> 01:42:20.758]  They cannot argue, they cannot debate in the free market of ideas.
[01:42:20.758 --> 01:42:24.320]  This is why they want to censor their political opposition.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.521]  And we saw this, where did we see this before?
[01:42:26.521 --> 01:42:34.026]  We saw this in the run-up to the 2016 election with the opposition research and the dirt that was thrown at Donald Trump.
[01:42:34.026 --> 01:42:39.970]  And we know that InfoWars and they've been, they
[01:42:41.079 --> 01:42:50.371]  Made history in fours, made history and supported and was really effectively assisted in the election of Donald Trump.
[01:42:50.371 --> 01:42:55.017]  And that's, I don't think anyone can argue that now it's payback time.
[01:42:55.017 --> 01:42:56.319]  It's payback by the deep state.
[01:42:57.148 --> 01:42:59.889]  So understand what is taking place here.
[01:42:59.889 --> 01:43:04.891]  And when I say that, I don't mean to sound like I'm speaking down, but just understand what's taking place.
[01:43:04.891 --> 01:43:08.832]  And for those who are rejoicing in the banning, I've been seeing a lot of that.
[01:43:08.832 --> 01:43:10.252]  I want to speak to that for a second.
[01:43:10.252 --> 01:43:13.313]  I've just got one word, schadenfreude.
[01:43:13.313 --> 01:43:16.714]  I don't know how many people have ever heard that word, schadenfreude.
[01:43:16.714 --> 01:43:17.595]  It's a German word.
[01:43:17.595 --> 01:43:21.596]  And the meaning of which, and perhaps I've spoken about it before, the meaning of which
[01:43:22.637 --> 01:43:29.102]  Those people who derive pleasure from someone else's troubles.
[01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:37.028]  And if that is where, and I see a lot of that, and if that's where you're at, well, that's a two-way street.
[01:43:37.028 --> 01:43:42.291]  Trust me when I tell you because it's no fun when you
[01:43:43.582 --> 01:43:56.285]  Are the recipient of the duct tape over your mouth, or when they shut you down, or when they file lawsuits against you for expressing your ideas, or when they misrepresent, even worse, misrepresent what you say in the marketplace.
[01:43:56.285 --> 01:43:58.726]  I'm a victim of that.
[01:43:58.726 --> 01:44:01.886]  I'm a victim of lawsuits, as is Infowars.
[01:44:01.886 --> 01:44:05.107]  It's the cheek thing to do right now.
[01:44:05.107 --> 01:44:07.528]  It's the way to silence the opposition.
[01:44:07.528 --> 01:44:08.328]  But you know what?
[01:44:08.328 --> 01:44:09.308]  Just like Alex Jones,
[01:44:10.457 --> 01:44:15.138]  It doesn't make me want to crawl up in a fetal position like some snowflake.
[01:44:15.138 --> 01:44:16.779]  Frankly, it hacks me off.
[01:44:16.779 --> 01:44:18.879]  And it makes me more determined to fight.
[01:44:18.879 --> 01:44:23.841]  And fight I will and fight so will Alex Jones and so will InfoWars.
[01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:32.623]  So I'm proud of InfoWars and I'm proud of the side that we're on in this fight.
[01:44:32.623 --> 01:44:35.184]  But I want to address another issue as well.
[01:44:36.090 --> 01:44:52.864]  Because I mentioned in the previous segment as well as this segment about the meeting and about the fact that we're looking at private companies with a gross domestic product equivalent of $2.7 trillion.
[01:44:52.864 --> 01:44:53.945]  Think about that.
[01:44:53.945 --> 01:44:59.430]  Think about that in terms of the sovereign power that wields in the marketplace.
[01:45:00.968 --> 01:45:15.494]  When you see things operating, when you see private companies operating in concert with each other in a 12-hour span, you think about both antitrust law as well as anti-monopoly laws and statutes.
[01:45:15.494 --> 01:45:20.596]  And there's a difference there, but without going into it, the bottom line is this.
[01:45:20.596 --> 01:45:26.779]  Some people would disagree, and I tend to agree that we want to keep government out of the private marketplace.
[01:45:27.378 --> 01:45:38.088]  But there are some would agree that the what we're seeing here is a violation of the antitrust laws, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, to be precise.
[01:45:38.088 --> 01:45:52.681]  And if you look at if you look at that and you do some research of history, you'll find that the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was a law passed by Congress under the presidency of Benjamin Harrison.
[01:45:53.656 --> 01:45:57.298]  And it regulated competition among enterprises.
[01:45:57.298 --> 01:45:59.579]  It's exactly what we're seeing today.
[01:45:59.579 --> 01:46:07.924]  And it authorized the Department of Justice to bring suits to enjoin, for example, to prohibit or that is to prohibit conduct violating the act.
[01:46:07.924 --> 01:46:14.467]  And additionally authorizes private parties injured by conduct violating the act to bring suits for treble damages.
[01:46:14.467 --> 01:46:17.128]  The reason I wanted to bring that up is because that's on the table here.
[01:46:17.128 --> 01:46:20.070]  I believe when you look at, as I said, the gross domestic product,
[01:46:21.228 --> 01:46:49.433]  2.8 the equivalent thereof 2.7 trillion dollars among four companies and the behavior of of I was gonna say Osama bin Laden the behavior Barack Hussein Obama and the meetings that have that took place the nomination of Cass Sunstein the all of that the history what was that all about and then of course the payback because as Alex has said many times and as I've said many times
[01:46:50.569 --> 01:46:53.131]  The deep state, the shadow government, refuses.
[01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:56.392]  They absolutely do not want a repeat of 2016.
[01:46:56.392 --> 01:46:58.494]  They can't afford it.
[01:46:58.494 --> 01:47:00.495]  They cannot lose in the midterms.
[01:47:00.495 --> 01:47:02.256]  They're all in.
[01:47:02.256 --> 01:47:08.319]  And I think if people understand what this is all about, elections have consequences.
[01:47:08.319 --> 01:47:14.003]  And we're seeing the fruits of that election and the consequences right now.
[01:47:14.003 --> 01:47:18.165]  We're seeing the vile, unspeakable hatred
[01:47:18.795 --> 01:47:25.919]  by these anti-Donald Trump supporters and anti-Donald Trump people.
[01:47:25.919 --> 01:47:27.180]  They themselves are the Nazis.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:27.980]  It's all coming out.
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:31.102]  And again, I mentioned Schadenfreude.
[01:47:31.102 --> 01:47:39.787]  Bottom line, if you're taking some sort of pleasure in seeing this, well, it's to your own peril.
[01:47:39.787 --> 01:47:42.329]  And I've got a message, finally, for this segment.

[01:48:04.637 --> 01:48:06.780]  Fighting back and fighting back like you've never seen.

[01:50:17.883 --> 01:50:28.470]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:30.532]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:50:30.532 --> 01:50:33.414]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:50:33.414 --> 01:50:34.895]  It's made in the USA.
[01:50:34.895 --> 01:50:38.037]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:50:38.257 --> 01:50:38.677]  Absolutely.
[01:50:58.604 --> 01:51:10.314]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[01:51:21.687 --> 01:51:27.412]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:51:27.412 --> 01:51:35.278]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:51:35.278 --> 01:51:38.441]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:51:38.621 --> 01:51:46.664]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:51:46.664 --> 01:51:55.648]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:51:55.708 --> 01:52:01.953]  It's powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract.
[01:52:01.953 --> 01:52:07.677]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[01:52:21.048 --> 01:52:23.650]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:52:42.190 --> 01:52:43.871]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:52:43.871 --> 01:52:55.136]  DougHagmanHagmanReport.com, sitting in for AlexInfoWars.com, at the tip of the spear, obviously, making a difference, making a difference in the marketplace.
[01:52:55.136 --> 01:53:07.421]  And as I spoke earlier about the censorship ban, and I want to get to a couple of other issues here, including some expansion about the New Mexico Islamist compound.
[01:53:07.421 --> 01:53:09.902]  I want to get to that here before the end of this segment.
[01:53:10.642 --> 01:53:20.688]  But I did find on the Daily Caller, and I'm not sure if Alex went over this or not, but Twitter plans hate speech crackdown after backlash from upset employees.
[01:53:20.688 --> 01:53:20.848]  Aww!
[01:53:22.803 --> 01:53:24.224]  Watch your binkies and blankets.
[01:53:24.224 --> 01:53:25.045]  That's right.
[01:53:25.045 --> 01:53:33.350]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday, yesterday, signaled a coming change to his company's speech policies following pressure from his own employees.
[01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:36.112]  So, what can you say about this?
[01:53:36.112 --> 01:53:37.593]  So, Twitter is next.
[01:53:37.593 --> 01:53:46.279]  Although you've got the shout-out banning on Twitter, you've got all of the other issues, the censorship of political opponents, which in and of itself
[01:53:47.399 --> 01:53:51.140]  You know, you've got the left yelling collusion for crying out loud.
[01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:52.161]  Where's the collusion?
[01:53:52.161 --> 01:53:55.122]  The collusion is here with these companies.
[01:53:55.122 --> 01:53:57.383]  But now Twitter, of course, saying, well, we're going to change some things.
[01:53:57.383 --> 01:53:59.603]  We're going to change some things.
[01:53:59.603 --> 01:54:02.465]  So they're planning to accelerate a crackdown on hate speech.
[01:54:02.465 --> 01:54:04.325]  Of course, hate speech.
[01:54:04.325 --> 01:54:06.326]  That's the key phrase.
[01:54:06.326 --> 01:54:08.027]  Hate speech.
[01:54:08.027 --> 01:54:11.568]  You know, I'd like I'd like someone to define what exactly what hate speech is.
[01:54:11.568 --> 01:54:13.709]  What are the parameters?
[01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:14.669]  It's truly subjective.
[01:54:15.723 --> 01:54:23.871]  Paul Joseph Watson did videos on hate speech and what have you, but we're in a very dangerous time right now.
[01:54:23.871 --> 01:54:30.378]  And of course, as Alex Jones has said, and as I've said, they're coming obviously not just for your guns, but they're coming for you.
[01:54:30.378 --> 01:54:32.700]  Second Amendment, First Amendment, here it is.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:36.605]  Which is why, by the way, you need to support this operation.
[01:54:37.245 --> 01:54:38.166]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:58.527 --> 01:55:02.208]  But if you want to be in this fight and you want to stay in this fight, you got to be healthy.
[01:55:02.208 --> 01:55:05.789]  So get yourself going with the products at InfoWars store.
[01:55:05.789 --> 01:55:07.990]  They've got a super special going on.
[01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:14.052]  You know, the mainstream media, of course, they're doing everything they can do to shut InfoWars down.
[01:55:14.052 --> 01:55:16.833]  Just wipe them, just erase them off the planet.
[01:55:17.936 --> 01:55:24.740]  While the tech giants work to remove InfoWars, remove us from the internet, InfoWars are dropping.
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:30.904]  They're already incredibly low prices and incredible products prices to help you support the InfoWars, so please do so.
[01:55:30.904 --> 01:55:31.825]  Get some skin in the game.
[01:55:33.739 --> 01:55:35.040]  So that's Twitter.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.921]  And here it is.
[01:55:36.921 --> 01:55:38.402]  It's Twitter.
[01:55:38.402 --> 01:55:40.042]  Changes are coming there.
[01:55:40.042 --> 01:55:45.485]  And I referenced, of course, the last segment about do we really want government involved in this?
[01:55:45.485 --> 01:55:48.046]  But look toward the actions of Obama.
[01:55:48.046 --> 01:55:53.749]  Look toward the actions of all of the usual suspects as being involved in what you see.
[01:55:53.749 --> 01:55:55.610]  And how are we going to fight them?
[01:55:55.610 --> 01:56:00.152]  We're going to fight them with everything we got because they're not going to win.
[01:56:00.152 --> 01:56:00.832]  I guarantee you.
[01:56:01.653 --> 01:56:03.374]  We're not going to let them win.
[01:56:03.374 --> 01:56:07.975]  And I ask you, help us, support us.
[01:56:07.975 --> 01:56:17.438]  Now, one of the most important things, I think, in addition to the censorship, of course, is the infiltration.
[01:56:17.438 --> 01:56:27.061]  Alex talked about the Chai Comps and the Chinese, of course, the espionage or the potential espionage, Dianne Feinstein.
[01:56:28.713 --> 01:56:31.914]  We have the Democratic IT scandal with the Oman brothers.
[01:56:31.914 --> 01:56:37.156]  You've got all of this foreign influence in this country.
[01:56:37.156 --> 01:56:38.976]  But you've got something else as well.
[01:56:38.976 --> 01:56:44.438]  You've got now reported this week, New Mexico, the New Mexico compound.
[01:56:44.438 --> 01:56:47.039]  Dad arrested at extremist Muslim.
[01:56:47.039 --> 01:56:50.540]  Note they have to put a modifier there, extremist.
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:54.021]  Extremist Muslim site trained kids to commit school shootings.
[01:56:55.217 --> 01:57:01.600]  And I spoke a little bit about this in the first segment with Alex, but I wanted just to connect some dots here.
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:10.223]  Because what we're seeing, and what we've been screaming about for a long time, are these Islamic training compounds.
[01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:21.868]  Now this is rudimentary at best, but nonetheless, it doesn't take much to organize a group of school children, young children,
[01:57:22.839 --> 01:57:28.844]  Show them how to use guns, and then push them off to commit school shootings.
[01:57:28.844 --> 01:57:31.026]  Think about that for a second.
[01:57:31.026 --> 01:57:48.160]  The guy behind this particular camp, Siraj Bin Wahaj, by the way, his son was reported missing, and the remains of a boy found on the property are believed to be those of his son.
[01:57:53.536 --> 01:57:58.759]  In addition to Siraj bin Wahaj, you've got other individuals that were also arrested.
[01:57:58.759 --> 01:58:02.621]  But the big story here is this, and the big takeaway is this.
[01:58:02.621 --> 01:58:19.031]  All across the United States, you've got this infiltration of Islamic extremist Muslims who are intent on bringing down our representative republic in favor of a country or an area ruled by Sharia.
[01:58:19.031 --> 01:58:22.553]  They have no intention whatsoever of assimilation.
[01:58:23.231 --> 01:58:27.735]  You've got open borders which permit this invasion.
[01:58:27.735 --> 01:58:31.599]  That's not limited to the Central American residents.
[01:58:31.599 --> 01:58:34.402]  It's not limited to residents of Mexico.
[01:58:34.402 --> 01:58:44.351]  It's actually bringing forth individuals from the Middle East, from Yemen, from other Middle Eastern countries or South African countries.
[01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:53.640]  And as they come into this country, they hook up and they develop, but they hook up with people like Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:59.942]  They get involved with these organizations such as Jamaat al-Fuqra.
[01:58:59.942 --> 01:59:13.406]  And by the way, if Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani, if that name rings a bell, he's the sheikh who Daniel Pearl was going to interview in Lahore, Pakistan when he was kidnapped.
[01:59:14.111 --> 01:59:15.553]  And subsequently found beheaded.
[01:59:15.553 --> 01:59:24.961]  Now, the FBI, of course, cleared Jelani, just to be clear, because I don't certainly don't need another lawsuit from Jelani.
[01:59:24.961 --> 01:59:31.708]  But just to be clear, Jelani, of course, was the man that Daniel Pearl was going to meet when he was kidnapped.
[01:59:31.708 --> 01:59:35.992]  But of course, the FBI cleared him of all suspicion.
[01:59:37.381 --> 01:59:42.525]  So what we have with this New Mexico compound is just a very tip of the iceberg.
[01:59:42.525 --> 01:59:44.826]  You've got numerous compounds all across the United States.
[01:59:44.826 --> 01:59:56.274]  I've documented one in Hancock, as I said, Hancock, New York, which was actually at one time served as the headquarters of this Islamic group called Shabbat al-Fuqra.
[01:59:56.274 --> 02:00:05.821]  And as I said before, Dr. Paul Williams and myself, we've written extensively about it.
[02:00:05.821 --> 02:00:06.041]  These
[02:00:07.859 --> 02:00:18.644]  These training compounds, they host paramilitary training, they host armories, for lack of a better term.
[02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:30.989]  And as I said, school buses, my goodness, the one in Hancock, New York, was shown on InfoWars, where school buses were in fact used, a school bus was used for practice.
[02:00:30.989 --> 02:00:34.151]  Keep your eye on this, because as we see,
[02:00:35.370 --> 02:00:39.992]  The continued banning of the truth.
[02:00:39.992 --> 02:00:52.979]  You're going to see there is a relationship between the exposure of the truth and the suppression of the truth.
[02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:53.939]  And that's what we're seeing today.
[02:00:53.939 --> 02:00:57.081]  The more that we expose, the more they've got to ban.
[02:00:58.232 --> 02:01:07.639]  So look for additional information from this particular training compound and this story as it spreads across the United States.
[02:01:07.639 --> 02:01:22.749]  Just to be clear, when I did my investigation of the Hancock report and I turned that information over to the FBI, Sheikh Jalani was notified ostensibly by the FBI after I turned my report in.
[02:01:23.576 --> 02:01:27.057]  And hence I've got a religious statement filed against me.
[02:01:27.057 --> 02:01:27.977]  It's still on the internet.
[02:01:27.977 --> 02:01:28.457]  You can read it.
[02:01:28.457 --> 02:01:31.898]  I'm not sure exactly where it is, but it's out there.
[02:01:31.898 --> 02:01:34.499]  And that gave me a visit from the FBI.
[02:01:34.499 --> 02:01:36.359]  A couple of agents said, you know what?
[02:01:36.359 --> 02:01:43.201]  We can't provide you security, but we wish you well and be careful and increase your security.
[02:01:43.201 --> 02:01:47.822]  So this is what we as American citizens face today.
[02:01:47.822 --> 02:01:53.023]  And that, by the way, was under the Bush administration and it continued even worse under Obama.
[02:01:54.039 --> 02:02:07.005]  So, in closing, as I wrap this up, and I'm so honored, by the way, to be here for Alex Jones, especially at a time like this, and for InfoWars, especially at a time like this, as I wrap this up.
[02:02:07.005 --> 02:02:09.146]  We are engaged in a civil war.
[02:02:09.146 --> 02:02:12.267]  We're engaged in asymmetrical warfare.
[02:02:12.267 --> 02:02:16.509]  And I'm going to close with this question.
[02:02:16.509 --> 02:02:20.691]  What could be worse than a civil war?
[02:02:20.691 --> 02:02:22.712]  I would say, possibly,
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:25.821]  Not having a civil war.
[02:02:25.821 --> 02:02:28.323]  I'd like you to think about that.
[02:02:28.323 --> 02:02:31.025]  As you finish your week.
[02:02:31.025 --> 02:02:34.267]  And as we play, really, for all the marbles.
[02:02:34.267 --> 02:02:36.368]  And we are playing for all the marbles.
[02:02:36.368 --> 02:02:38.290]  They certainly are.
[02:02:38.290 --> 02:02:43.053]  The fascists, the Nazis, the deep states are playing for all the marbles.
[02:02:43.053 --> 02:02:45.474]  Folks, thank you so much.
