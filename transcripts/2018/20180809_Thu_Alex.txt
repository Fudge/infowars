[00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:13.243]  Political outrage turns bloody in Berkeley.
[00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:23.252]  Our KPIX5 crews were right in the middle of the chaos as both Trump supporters and anti-Trump activists come to blows.
[00:00:23.332 --> 00:00:27.255]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center.
[00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:32.519]  Around the corner and away from police protection on San Carlos Street, a mob mentality took over.
[00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:33.460]  Who voted Trump?
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.402]  Who voted Trump?
[00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:35.662]  Yeah!
[00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:40.203]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[00:00:40.303 --> 00:00:42.825]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, stop!
[00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:44.827]  These were pure attacks.
[00:00:44.887 --> 00:00:50.871]  Trump supporters, men, women, even the elderly, left this building last night and walked right into danger.
[00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:56.114]  This Trump supporter was the first casualty of the day, with blood streaming out of his face.
[00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:59.116]  Pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters got into it.
[00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:07.617]  And now they're rushing it.
[00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:29.381]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:30.582]  It got ugly.
[00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:34.505]  Violence erupting at the event as fights broke out.
[00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:39.388]  Fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:40.709]  It gets pretty ugly.
[00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:44.732]  I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[00:01:51.917 --> 00:02:01.586]  Organizers say today's rallies were meant as a show of unity against what they call a seditious fringe allegedly trying to sabotage the president.
[00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:07.652]  You can see there a FedEx delivery driver jumping in to try to put an end to the protest.
[00:02:08.152 --> 00:02:10.414]  Just to strike the numbers, I'll give it to you.
[00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:13.938]  Liv, if you want to come out, you better be up a hundred of you against one of me, because that's what it's going to take.
[00:02:27.058 --> 00:02:28.640]  You got that?
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.521]  This is the heart of 1776!
[00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:44.833]  The reason we're banned, the reason we're censored, the reason we're being shut down is we exposed that the Chi-Coms have basically taken control of Silicon Valley.
[00:02:45.253 --> 00:02:46.935]  It's now mainstream news and they've panicked.
[00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.658]  I got another report we're writing that's going to go to the President next Tuesday.
[00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:51.799]  It's going to go right into his hands.
[00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:55.998]  About how you're doing it and how it can be stopped.
[00:02:56.038 --> 00:02:57.639]  So good luck thinking you shot us down.
[00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.320]  You walked right into our trap.
[00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.122]  Now, here's why they're so upset the country's coming back from the dead.
[00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:12.928]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:18.531]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:23.627]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:26.269]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:34.616]  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[00:03:34.876 --> 00:03:39.400]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.744]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:50.740]  Getting a good picture of everybody so we look nice and handsome.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.520]  Beautiful.
[00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:52.501]  Perfect.
[00:03:56.044 --> 00:03:59.507]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:03.650]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.674]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:14.539]  He's not a politician.
[00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:15.980]  He's one of us.
[00:04:20.342 --> 00:04:22.523]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:30.246]  Never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you.
[00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:33.528]  Carry yourself with dignity and pride.
[00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.850]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:48.374]  Embrace that label because it's the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference.
[00:04:50.307 --> 00:04:51.827]  And that's why they want us shut down.
[00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:57.628]  We are the outsiders, we are banned, and we are number one on iTunes and on Android after being banned.
[00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:58.709]  Number one!
[00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.210]  Hey, have you heard?
[00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.751]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:10.351]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, they're all censoring us.
[00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:16.612]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[00:05:16.912 --> 00:05:19.933]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.122]  Everything we do here at InfoWars is possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:36.263]  We have huge specials.
[00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.885]  If you've not seen the InfoWars store yet, go check it out.
[00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:44.768]  New t-shirts at the InfoWars store as well, including one that I just got.
[00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.770]  The new InfoWars hexagon logo.
[00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.892]  Very, very cool logo.
[00:05:50.332 --> 00:05:56.036]  And kind of more discreet, so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:59.178]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:00.659]  Huge discount store-wide right now.
[00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:05.682]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:11.405]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:16.388 --> 00:06:19.070]  So, we've got the Twitter employees.
[00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.693]  We've got Joe Scarborough, who had the dead intern found in his office, calling for him to be banned.
[00:06:23.713 --> 00:06:26.955]  You've got BuzzFeed, the New York Times, running.
[00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:32.590]  Huge polls where 78% of their own readers say, no, we don't want Alex banned.
[00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:38.595]  Because the New York Times, print me that article please, asked the question, will he be completely banned everywhere?
[00:06:38.635 --> 00:06:40.397]  Hell, should he be thrown in a gulag basically?
[00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:43.640]  And people said, no, you're crazy.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:53.809]  And then you read all the Twitter comments, even people that don't like me or don't like the straw man that mainstream media has built about me said, this is authoritarianism big time.
[00:06:54.707 --> 00:06:55.108]  Here it is.
[00:06:55.368 --> 00:07:00.298]  Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest and Apple have removed Alex Jones and InfoWars from their platforms.
[00:07:01.741 --> 00:07:03.725]  Should Twitter follow suit?
[00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:14.747]  Over 11,000 users, this was days ago, it's more than that now, have responded at the time of the writing with 78% rejecting the proposal, only 14% supporting it.
[00:07:15.488 --> 00:07:28.779]  Users have swam the Times for encouraging more censorship from authoritarian tech giants, also citing the paper's highly controversial hire of outspoken anti-white journalist Sarah Young to its editorial board in blatant hypocrisy.
[00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:34.433]  But at least you can show her tweets where she says whites are subhumans and need to be exterminated.
[00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:36.354]  They don't ever show anything I say.
[00:07:38.594 --> 00:07:42.696]  They just go, Jones says the moon landings didn't happen, never said it.
[00:07:43.076 --> 00:07:46.437]  Jones says there's Martian bases, never, with slaves on it, never said it.
[00:07:47.537 --> 00:07:52.278]  Jones says nobody died at Sandy Hook and bullies the families, that's out of context from years ago.
[00:07:52.758 --> 00:07:54.839]  They never show me saying I think they died.
[00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:56.540]  They reopen it.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.720]  They reopen the wounds.
[00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:11.350]  But they're the New York Times that quarterbacked the lies about WMD, Yellowcake, Aluminum Tubes, consciously with the Office of Special Plans to launch that evil war that killed millions and many of our troops as well.
[00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:15.851]  So, the vast majority voted against it.
[00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:21.732]  People say, I would never have thought about listening to or supporting Alex Jones until today.
[00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:26.933]  This won't end well for the leftists who support this deplatforming, warned another user.
[00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:43.499]  When I sit there and I watch Brian Stelter and all the usual suspects in clips online, people only watch it to ridicule it, when actually watch the main program usually.
[00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:56.538]  They're like, Donald Trump wants to shut down the internet and free press.
[00:08:56.938 --> 00:08:57.519]  He's dangerous.
[00:08:57.539 --> 00:08:58.640]  He wants blood everywhere.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.102]  He wants us killed because he criticizes us.
[00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:05.326]  It's horrible that he wants to shut down media and says he doesn't like the First Amendment.
[00:09:06.106 --> 00:09:07.307]  Donald Trump said none of that.
[00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:09.109]  He counter-punches to you liars.
[00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.795]  And then you'll have the same program, the same hour, where they're like,
[00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:19.970]  Twitter needs to ban Alex Jones right now.
[00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:21.772]  Why is he still on?
[00:09:22.173 --> 00:09:23.655]  He should be banned from everywhere.
[00:09:23.915 --> 00:09:25.657]  He's clearly a very dangerous person.
[00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:31.746]  We can't allow evil, racist, horrible, Nazi ideas like this to continue.
[00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:32.848]  It's too dangerous.
[00:09:34.537 --> 00:09:37.820]  So out of one side of their mouth, they're like, shut Alex Jones down, shut all the conservatives down.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.404]  Senator Murphy says Jones is just the tip of the rotting iceberg.
[00:09:42.504 --> 00:09:43.765]  Ban all the conservatives.
[00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:45.526]  Our democracy depends on it.
[00:09:45.867 --> 00:09:50.791]  You mean America has politically realigned against you?
[00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:55.675]  You've been denying the censorship, so now you're just admitting it.
[00:09:55.715 --> 00:09:57.456]  It's like in Braveheart, they ask, what are you doing?
[00:09:58.357 --> 00:10:01.640]  To William Wallace, he says, I'm going to pick a fight.
[00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.022]  And that's what we've done, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:09.064]  We didn't say any of the things that they said we said.
[00:10:10.124 --> 00:10:19.869]  What we did do was let the New York Times and the Washington Post and others know that there's been more hidden camera footage of their people coming out soon.
[00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.310]  And it's damning.
[00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:27.513]  And more importantly, we talked about the Chi-Coms and told everybody
[00:10:29.787 --> 00:10:43.981]  The personnel, Office of Personnel Management hack was an Obama handover of our infrastructure, a globalist merger that China is on a war footing against us, that Apple and Google have officially moved to China and are building censorship systems here in their own whistleblowers admissions.
[00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:47.985]  They don't want me amplifying what the intercept documents show.
[00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:53.551]  And I told crew here, last week, I said, you watch.
[00:10:56.357 --> 00:10:59.181]  I believe we'll be banned by next week for this China reporting.
[00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:03.929]  Because we also said on Friday that Feinstein had a Chinese spy.
[00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:05.992]  She didn't have a Chinese spy.
[00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:07.154]  She put him there on purpose.
[00:11:07.474 --> 00:11:08.816]  That was part of her marriage to China.
[00:11:09.117 --> 00:11:11.140]  Her husband's biotech company based in China.
[00:11:15.017 --> 00:11:16.078]  She's a Chinese spy!
[00:11:16.618 --> 00:11:20.361]  And man, I said that last Friday, last Thursday.
[00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:25.284]  And then when that came out over the weekend, they went, whoa, who does Jones know?
[00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:28.247]  Man, I don't need to get this from the Pentagon.
[00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:31.829]  I get it from my own open source research about who surrounds her.
[00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:36.392]  And some quick checking, you know, the Democrats are Chinese communist agents.
[00:11:36.953 --> 00:11:38.354]  It was the Rockefeller plan.
[00:11:40.175 --> 00:11:41.196]  That's who they are!
[00:11:42.878 --> 00:11:47.282]  You think China didn't have running water in 1949 almost anywhere but a few hotels?
[00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:58.292]  I mean, China until the 80s, most bathrooms were latrines at restaurants.
[00:11:59.613 --> 00:12:03.096]  You go to many areas of China still, there's a hole in the ground you crap in.
[00:12:04.197 --> 00:12:10.022]  How did they go from not having a pot to piss in, and now they've got everything better than us?
[00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:13.679]  We were sold out.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.382]  They have tariffs on everything, we have nothing on them.
[00:12:16.722 --> 00:12:17.603]  They have slave labor.
[00:12:17.743 --> 00:12:18.464]  It was a setup.
[00:12:19.645 --> 00:12:28.433]  And I'm a patriotic, loyal American because I believe in Americanism and I believe in the free market and I believe in the vision of the Renaissance.
[00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:35.020]  And I've just been advising Congress
[00:12:36.738 --> 00:12:42.764]  And everybody else, they're talking about Russia collusion, because we have them on China.
[00:12:43.064 --> 00:12:43.865]  We have them.
[00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:44.806]  We have them.
[00:12:45.086 --> 00:12:45.687]  We have them.
[00:12:49.651 --> 00:12:52.534]  We have them politically in our gun sites.
[00:12:52.634 --> 00:12:53.935]  That does not mean we're going to shoot them.
[00:12:54.316 --> 00:12:57.599]  I think the public is going to go, Jones claims Feinstein's in his gun sites.
[00:12:57.739 --> 00:12:58.259]  Politically.
[00:12:58.922 --> 00:13:04.607]  Just like Giuliani said that this whole investigation is going to blow up in Mueller's face.
[00:13:04.907 --> 00:13:11.573]  That doesn't mean blow him up with C4 or TNT or dynamite like Wile E. Coyote.
[00:13:12.934 --> 00:13:16.617]  It means it's going to blow up in his face like every thinking person knows.
[00:13:21.954 --> 00:13:23.494]  It's all coming down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:23.534 --> 00:13:25.015]  Folks better decide which side they're on.
[00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:29.116]  So I have a statement at InfoWars.com that we've retweeted at RealAlexJones.
[00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:30.196]  I'm going to retweet it again.
[00:13:30.536 --> 00:13:32.316]  Alex Jones has written a statement on internet censorship.
[00:13:34.077 --> 00:13:39.158]  And then I'm going to get into what's really going on with Jack Dorsey and what's going to unfold.
[00:13:39.178 --> 00:13:40.638]  But this is all about the elections.
[00:13:41.658 --> 00:13:43.258]  This is all about free speech.
[00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:46.179]  This is all about setting the precedent to de-platform everybody.
[00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:50.220]  And it's about bringing in the communist Chinese style
[00:13:52.230 --> 00:14:00.492]  Global social score that Google developed as a social engineering control tool to track everything you do that China has bought.
[00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:02.212]  This is all on record.
[00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:04.372]  We first broke it five years ago.
[00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:06.613]  Now it's all on record.
[00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:11.414]  And the enemy just keeps asking, how do we know all this?
[00:14:12.694 --> 00:14:13.814]  The nose knows.
[00:14:13.834 --> 00:14:17.895]  I mean, I study all this stuff and then I'm able to integrate it together.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:24.144]  And I'm able to understand how these systems work and a lot of you guys brag about this stuff in white papers so I can figure it out.
[00:14:24.204 --> 00:14:28.067]  But now people figure out what Jones figures out is what's going on.
[00:14:30.188 --> 00:14:35.692]  And they want me shut up as if you guys understand I would be more devastating as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill.
[00:14:36.673 --> 00:14:38.674]  Just going in and talking to people and giving them reports.
[00:14:38.854 --> 00:14:40.015]  I'm starting to figure that out too.
[00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:41.756]  Why sit here and talk to the masses?
[00:14:43.277 --> 00:14:43.838]  Reports.
[00:14:45.316 --> 00:14:54.459]  Reports, because people already know my reports, our reports are kryptonite to evil, kryptonite to globalism, kryptonite to the Chai comms.
[00:14:54.499 --> 00:14:57.859]  And so we get more sophisticated by the month.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:03.701]  We learn more in a month now than we learn in a year before.
[00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:08.923]  And by the way, we were already when we launched this new app and I heard him up.
[00:15:08.983 --> 00:15:10.183]  I said, get the app out soon.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.141]  The app was ready a few months ago and I got busy and didn't plug it.
[00:15:14.161 --> 00:15:15.921]  So we officially launched it about 3-4 weeks ago.
[00:15:16.322 --> 00:15:19.523]  It was already in the top 40 of news apps because we're popular already.
[00:15:20.283 --> 00:15:21.943]  And then when they banned it, it went to number 3.
[00:15:22.023 --> 00:15:25.465]  Now number 1 on iTunes and Android.
[00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:30.586]  And it's number 40-something, or maybe it's 30 now, in just total apps globally.
[00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:39.070]  And then, oh my God, the New York Times, the Washington Post, Piss Feed, all of them, Buzzkill.
[00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.791]  They don't know what to do when it's number one.
[00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:47.192]  And they just can't stand it because, again, the Streisand effect blew up.
[00:15:48.092 --> 00:15:50.573]  And this isn't China, where they gotta test their censorship systems.
[00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:52.634]  It's America, so there's still some fightin' spirit.
[00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:58.155]  So if they don't know what to do, get the free app now, InfoWars.com forward slash app, and sign up for the free podcast.
[00:16:00.132 --> 00:16:04.513]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[00:16:05.554 --> 00:16:10.135]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[00:16:12.135 --> 00:16:15.216]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[00:16:16.116 --> 00:16:17.837]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[00:16:21.698 --> 00:16:26.202]  Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[00:16:26.462 --> 00:16:30.985]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[00:16:31.305 --> 00:16:35.368]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:41.373]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:54.435]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[00:16:54.455 --> 00:16:59.478]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[00:17:00.118 --> 00:17:01.319]  He's not a politician.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.820]  He's one of us.
[00:17:05.322 --> 00:17:07.483]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[00:17:09.965 --> 00:17:12.446]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[00:17:13.207 --> 00:17:17.490]  Embrace that label, because it's the outsiders who change the world.
[00:17:18.786 --> 00:17:21.027]  And who make a real and lasting difference.
[00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:26.909]  Treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation.
[00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:30.410]  Three American hostages are back home.
[00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.352]  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
[00:17:36.012 --> 00:17:43.074]  Seize this moment, believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe once more in America.
[00:17:44.055 --> 00:17:47.936]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body,
[00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:52.583]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[00:17:53.023 --> 00:17:56.665]  The forgotten man and the forgotten woman.

[00:20:12.066 --> 00:20:12.707]  Will you fight?
[00:20:13.867 --> 00:20:16.088]  Right?
[00:20:16.308 --> 00:20:18.049]  Against that?
[00:20:18.429 --> 00:20:18.749]  No!
[00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:19.990]  We will run!
[00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.590]  And we will live!
[00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:23.251]  Die?
[00:20:24.071 --> 00:20:24.992]  Fight and you may die.
[00:20:25.012 --> 00:20:27.573]  Run, and you'll live.
[00:20:29.201 --> 00:20:29.901]  At least a while.
[00:20:30.281 --> 00:20:33.443]  I'm dying in your beds many years from now.
[00:20:34.683 --> 00:20:52.271]  Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
[00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:58.287]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:20:58.908 --> 00:21:00.448]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.831]  There's a lot of other big world news happening.
[00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:12.592]  I intend to open the phones up today to get your take on what's unfolding.
[00:21:14.102 --> 00:21:25.029]  But obviously, we are at the center right now of the big global controversy of, oh, we've demonized this guy Alex Jones.
[00:21:25.049 --> 00:21:28.531]  He's bad because we all agree in mainstream media and academia.
[00:21:30.472 --> 00:21:31.653]  So let's deplatform him.
[00:21:31.673 --> 00:21:32.493]  Let's shut him off.
[00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:35.935]  Let's contact all the companies that run software for his websites.
[00:21:36.335 --> 00:21:40.278]  And let's just bankrupt him in a giant coordinated mafia attack.
[00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:44.107]  That's what the Nazis did in Nazi Germany.
[00:21:44.127 --> 00:21:45.609]  That's what the Mafia did in this country.
[00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:46.690]  It's totally illegal.
[00:21:47.851 --> 00:21:50.673]  But they think they're going to get away with it and set the precedent for it.
[00:21:52.154 --> 00:21:54.196]  Not if the American people contact Congress.
[00:21:55.657 --> 00:21:57.279]  Not if folks take action.
[00:21:57.319 --> 00:22:00.641]  So, I am asking to be able to testify to Congress.
[00:22:03.003 --> 00:22:05.726]  And to go under, you know, the hot lights.
[00:22:05.786 --> 00:22:07.507]  But I want it to be live and on television.
[00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:10.690]  And to really lay out what's really going on here.
[00:22:12.455 --> 00:22:19.961]  And I've been talking to several members of Congress, and I have other sources talking to them as well, about sponsoring us in a committee to have those hearings.
[00:22:20.662 --> 00:22:22.443]  And then to come in and lay out what's really going on.
[00:22:22.743 --> 00:22:26.486]  Because I can walk in there with exhibits of the quotes of U.S.
[00:22:26.526 --> 00:22:31.350]  Senators, you name it, saying they want to shut down their competition politically.
[00:22:32.691 --> 00:22:33.352]  So let me now
[00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:42.563]  Read to you my statement that's on Infowars.com that we just retweeted at RealAlexJones on Twitter and at Prison Planet on Paul Watson's Twitter.
[00:22:46.706 --> 00:22:54.970]  Because what you're about to hear exactly three months out from the critical midterm election, the most important midterm election in U.S.
[00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.752]  history undoubtedly, what you are about to hear
[00:22:59.645 --> 00:23:24.112]  Is the key to having the will of the people and a free open election take place to continue making this country great again and taking it out from under the control of the big multinational banks, the corrupt influence of the EU, but mainly the communist Chinese that own our debt, own Hollywood, have thousands of front companies in the U.S., control major universities, and are now working with big tech giants to complete censorship here in America.
[00:23:24.172 --> 00:23:28.113]  This is a 21st century economic and cyber invasion.
[00:23:29.246 --> 00:23:32.548]  And I, as a modern Paul Revere, am raising the alarm.
[00:23:33.848 --> 00:23:35.609]  They tried to buy me off a long time ago.
[00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:38.871]  Almost anybody wants to be famous and part of Hollywood.
[00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:41.812]  And I was... You want to put me in movies and starring roles?
[00:23:42.753 --> 00:23:43.713]  At my own TV show?
[00:23:44.354 --> 00:23:45.434]  Ten million dollars a year?
[00:23:45.454 --> 00:23:49.996]  That was a lot of money in 2005, 2006.
[00:23:51.137 --> 00:23:52.197]  But I turned it down, folks.
[00:23:52.217 --> 00:23:52.918]  It was easy to do.
[00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:55.079]  And now you see why.
[00:23:56.792 --> 00:23:59.973]  So, they just collect people like baseball cards.
[00:24:02.434 --> 00:24:03.494]  Now, let's continue here.
[00:24:06.135 --> 00:24:10.496]  Alex Jones' written statement on internet censorship, this is critical to get out.
[00:24:12.016 --> 00:24:16.138]  This is a dangerous precedent that can be used against any ideology, left or right.
[00:24:17.338 --> 00:24:20.519]  Across the board, in what appears to be a highly coordinated effort,
[00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:24.341]  And I tried to be nice there.
[00:24:24.361 --> 00:24:25.682]  It's admittedly coordinated.
[00:24:26.242 --> 00:24:43.365]  Across the board in what appears to be a highly coordinated effort to silence the message behind InfoWars and Alex Jones, most major social media backbone utilities associated with our website and video platforms have launched unprecedented account bans and suspensions on virtually all of our channels.
[00:24:44.425 --> 00:24:49.306]  Regardless of what you think of me and what you have heard indirectly through third-party sources,
[00:24:50.376 --> 00:24:53.719]  You are clearly witnessing a 21st century purge of an ideology.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:03.607]  And even if you don't agree with our message, or the strawman message you've been told, that everyone should exercise their right to question the status quo, you should be very concerned about what's happening.
[00:25:11.974 --> 00:25:18.780]  Because this ideology that is now under attack is the same ideology that played a pivotal role in the founding of this great nation.
[00:25:20.037 --> 00:25:26.124]  Challenging the establishment system with independent ideas that encourage new debates and discussions.
[00:25:26.804 --> 00:25:35.574]  For more than a year we have witnessed the mainstream media and the democratic groups tell us that the manipulation of social media could turn an election and is criminal.
[00:25:37.093 --> 00:25:52.549]  But their own admission, and by their own admission, social media would be the most viable option to alter the course of a nation, influence millions of people, and shut down free speech and personal expression that question the status quo, i.e.
[00:25:52.589 --> 00:25:54.191]  the global social credit score.
[00:25:55.609 --> 00:26:06.936]  We have been told that one of the greatest threats to our republic's democracy, we're a constitutional republic, is the manipulation of the information that we receive on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
[00:26:08.357 --> 00:26:22.125]  Now that these groups that have been telling us that free speech must be defended against those who seek to control it on our news feeds have launched a full-scale war on free speech and information that they disagree with.
[00:26:22.998 --> 00:26:34.305]  There is no question that large social media companies have become the nation's premier sources of information, 90% of it, referring hundreds of millions to news and information daily.
[00:26:38.928 --> 00:26:45.393]  Although these groups are private entities, their scale has achieved that of monopoly on the free flow of information.
[00:26:46.348 --> 00:27:04.100]  Much like the FCC rules that the airwaves and cables should be equally accessible to all in the public trust, these modes of communication could and should be equally open to the same access and not subject to control by those who may choose to disagree with the information itself.
[00:27:06.062 --> 00:27:09.604]  Is a different opinion enough to silence an entire ideology?
[00:27:10.465 --> 00:27:11.806]  Or ban someone to the Phantom Zone?
[00:27:13.288 --> 00:27:35.300]  I do not claim to always be right, but the accusations leveled at me are distortions of the truth and have been used to systematically impeach my character with never allowing me to respond and now attempting to completely de-platform me so I can respond to nothing so a real straw man can be built and then destroyed as the archetype to destroy all of your speech.
[00:27:38.035 --> 00:27:52.665]  But the coordinated action of the establishment to silence me has only awakened a new resolve in those who now see more clearly than ever how the establishment systems will go to any level to shut down free speech and information that questions the status quo.
[00:27:54.486 --> 00:27:56.107]  This is a turning point for our nation.
[00:27:56.647 --> 00:27:57.248]  Make no mistake.
[00:27:58.206 --> 00:28:08.889]  Will you rally behind the principles of free speech, or will you concede to having your ability to access new ideas and information restricted and controlled by those who believe you cannot think for yourself?
[00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:16.332]  If we allow this level of corruption and censorship to continue, it won't be long before it becomes normalized, which is now happening.
[00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:24.812]  How long before it's not Alex Jones and Infowars being shut down on major platforms, but any ideology that disagrees with the establishment status quo.
[00:28:25.332 --> 00:28:27.913]  There'll be cliques even within companies and subgroups.
[00:28:27.953 --> 00:28:33.914]  It's all about power and you feed into the pettiness of the worst people just giving them the power through something like this.
[00:28:33.954 --> 00:28:34.654]  It's a total nightmare.
[00:28:35.454 --> 00:28:37.875]  We must rally behind the principles that founded this great nation.
[00:28:38.895 --> 00:28:48.400]  And not allow deep censorship to become normalized and accepted or next we will face the other degrees of tyranny that invariably follow like night follows day and day follows night.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:57.564]  We'll be back with how to fight back and who else is being censored and the Democrats call to silence everyone ahead of the midterms except their people.
[00:28:57.844 --> 00:28:58.605]  This is true evil.
[00:29:00.231 --> 00:29:01.152]  We knew it was coming.
[00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:02.774]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:29:03.035 --> 00:29:16.273]  First, demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:29:19.122 --> 00:29:29.229]  Two weeks later, banned InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:29:29.829 --> 00:29:48.722]  And so their answer is, have CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and all these other corrupt organizations openly lobby for us to be removed and then organize their listeners, their viewers, the different university organizations, Antifa, sleeping giants, and a bunch of other groups
[00:29:49.762 --> 00:30:00.186]  To then go mass flag us in the community guidelines, which again was something out of 1984 or a Kafka novel, where you don't even know what you've supposedly done.
[00:30:00.366 --> 00:30:01.707]  You can't face your accuser.
[00:30:02.147 --> 00:30:07.249]  Then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:22.062]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent in their own words for you, nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[00:30:22.862 --> 00:30:27.365]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[00:30:28.045 --> 00:30:30.647]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key.
[00:30:31.047 --> 00:30:34.770]  Apple has officially moved to China and is letting the government basically run Apple.
[00:30:35.988 --> 00:30:36.869]  That, of course, is iTunes.
[00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:43.955]  Google is building a huge censorship search engine for them, and whistleblowers from inside Google say they're preparing to use it here in America.
[00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:52.403]  In fact, they're beta testing different parts of the censorship system for China on American conservatives, nationalists, and Trump supporters.
[00:30:53.003 --> 00:30:58.528]  The bigger issue is they don't like info wars exposing the fact in great detail.
[00:30:59.509 --> 00:31:11.975]  The Communist China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda operations, and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to block the Trump agenda.
[00:31:12.275 --> 00:31:13.876]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:16.297]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[00:31:16.717 --> 00:31:26.002]  It's happening right now, and it's designed to silence the American people and other populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate totalitarianism.
[00:31:26.522 --> 00:31:31.509]  This now becomes the last battle of the Civil War.
[00:31:31.609 --> 00:31:37.176]  You know, Fox, Breitbart, Sinclair, and Alex Jones, which has now been taken off of Facebook, thank God.
[00:31:37.757 --> 00:31:43.605]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing others is to simply
[00:31:44.466 --> 00:31:47.069]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:31:47.469 --> 00:31:48.911]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[00:31:49.372 --> 00:31:50.172]  Just click on the link.
[00:31:50.413 --> 00:31:53.376]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[00:31:54.037 --> 00:32:05.409]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:18.637]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:32:18.877 --> 00:32:20.218]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:32:20.578 --> 00:32:21.218]  You're an adult.
[00:32:21.558 --> 00:32:23.559]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.522]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make your own decision.
[00:32:29.282 --> 00:32:32.784]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:32:34.225 --> 00:32:35.866]  I was never trying to win a popularity contest.
[00:32:36.026 --> 00:32:39.628]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's happening.
[00:32:39.868 --> 00:32:41.069]  We've been very successful.
[00:32:41.129 --> 00:32:42.309]  I've expected to be attacked.
[00:32:42.329 --> 00:32:45.751]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear, but it's happened.
[00:32:46.231 --> 00:32:51.074]  So now, Infowars is the banner of free speech, the renaissance in Western culture and civilization.
[00:32:51.334 --> 00:32:59.338]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to fall against your cherished free speech, and you'll lose everything else if you don't stand up for it now.
[00:33:03.266 --> 00:33:09.487]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.129 --> 00:33:25.770]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.311]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:47.654 --> 00:33:49.815]  That's right, they were censoring in secret.
[00:33:51.576 --> 00:33:52.837]  But they went a little too far.
[00:33:52.857 --> 00:34:06.224]  And now they've had a policy of truth and said we want Alex Jones and every other nationalist and every other white male and every other conservative and Christian and every other capitalist banned off the internet and everything else.
[00:34:07.284 --> 00:34:08.325]  Policy of truth!
[00:34:09.205 --> 00:34:10.066]  Never again, huh?
[00:34:10.366 --> 00:34:12.907]  Ha ha!
[00:34:13.588 --> 00:34:14.168]  Fools!
[00:34:15.269 --> 00:34:15.689]  And now...
[00:34:18.576 --> 00:34:30.902]  After our app goes to number one in the world on both the Android and Google app in news and is set to go to number one total, they are in panic mode.
[00:34:33.164 --> 00:34:44.810]  CNN, MSNBC, BuzzFeed, The New York Times, they are screeching and telling Apple you must delete his app.
[00:34:45.635 --> 00:34:47.596]  I've had seven or eight apps on there before.
[00:34:47.716 --> 00:34:48.997]  They get old, we launch new ones.
[00:34:49.397 --> 00:34:50.338]  We have apps on there.
[00:34:51.078 --> 00:34:58.362]  We have an old app we launched like eight, nine years ago that's just audio and text articles that's got like nine million people that signed up for it.
[00:35:00.684 --> 00:35:02.845]  So of course millions have already signed up for this.
[00:35:03.205 --> 00:35:04.766]  Of course it's gonna go to number one.
[00:35:05.607 --> 00:35:12.871]  Oh see, but you say you're the real news over at CNN when you're not rigging the debates or lying about WMDs just like the New York Times.
[00:35:15.233 --> 00:35:18.374]  And you've got the Weekly Standard, a failed publication no one reads.
[00:35:18.394 --> 00:35:19.955]  They all want us banned.
[00:35:19.975 --> 00:35:24.216]  Notice how CNN spends it when they're not getting Gulf State dictator money or Chi-Com money.
[00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:27.857]  It's... Apple and Google... Go ahead and put it back up, please.
[00:35:28.898 --> 00:35:39.882]  Apple and Google are still selling the InfoWars app, which contains some of the same type of content that both tech giants have pulled from elsewhere on their platforms.
[00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:43.563]  What have you been hearing here on the air?
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.162]  But they want to arrest the former mayor of London who's a liberal?
[00:35:48.182 --> 00:35:49.963]  Because he said there's people with burqas everywhere?
[00:35:50.223 --> 00:35:51.664]  That's not good in a Western society?
[00:35:51.824 --> 00:35:52.604]  Where are the feminists?
[00:35:53.044 --> 00:35:54.585]  They're looking at arresting him!
[00:35:54.605 --> 00:35:56.326]  I have the articles.
[00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.991]  First they were saying it was a criminal offense, now they're saying it isn't.
[00:36:04.091 --> 00:36:05.612]  This is their intimidation!
[00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:09.714]  I was in a cheesecake factory and women came in in the beekeeper suits.
[00:36:10.014 --> 00:36:10.815]  Scared the hell out of me!
[00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:11.595]  I had three daughters!
[00:36:11.815 --> 00:36:12.616]  They were there with me!
[00:36:12.796 --> 00:36:13.957]  They're like, Dad, what's that?
[00:36:15.111 --> 00:36:16.992]  The woman was getting food and eating under her deal!
[00:36:17.332 --> 00:36:19.093]  She's a slave under Sharia!
[00:36:19.853 --> 00:36:21.073]  She can't drive a car!
[00:36:22.014 --> 00:36:22.994]  She goes to prison!
[00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:27.636]  And she gets caught with it off her head.
[00:36:28.616 --> 00:36:30.577]  Oh, the new Burka Barbie!
[00:36:32.618 --> 00:36:36.219]  And you go to the mall now, and it's just like, you know, on the gap and everywhere.
[00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:37.980]  Paul Watson's report's coming up next segment.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.701]  There are big signs of how cool it is.
[00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:42.382]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:36:44.226 --> 00:36:46.026]  Don't open a door for me, patriarchy!
[00:36:46.387 --> 00:36:47.247]  America sucks!
[00:36:53.188 --> 00:36:57.209]  But, don't criticize somebody wearing a burka, we'll kick you off.
[00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.050]  And they do, in Germany, they arrest you.
[00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.651]  They hired former Stasi operatives to run.
[00:37:06.071 --> 00:37:09.532]  Four years ago, the Facebook reporting of people to the police.
[00:37:10.848 --> 00:37:11.809]  To get him put in jail.
[00:37:12.549 --> 00:37:13.630]  That's where we are!
[00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.311]  The takedown of our country!
[00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:33.623]  Being conditioned and trained, get everybody on the social networks, make it 90% of the web, and then condition you and shut you down if you don't submit to the insanity and have weirdos from San Francisco tell you you're not liberal because you're not into all this sickening weirdness.
[00:37:37.806 --> 00:37:38.947]  This is authoritarianism.
[00:37:38.987 --> 00:37:39.107]  So,
[00:37:40.251 --> 00:37:46.135]  Imagine, we're the number one app in news on Android and on Apple, and what is their response?
[00:37:46.175 --> 00:37:48.656]  We're number 30-something now in the world.
[00:37:53.419 --> 00:37:57.321]  Now, again, what you keep showing from yesterday is just a screenshot of trending.
[00:37:58.542 --> 00:37:59.543]  Go to the actual news.
[00:37:59.583 --> 00:38:00.884]  We're number one on Apple.
[00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:01.424]  Pull it up.
[00:38:02.825 --> 00:38:05.006]  In fact, have the crew in there get us together the new screenshots, please.
[00:38:05.026 --> 00:38:05.907]  I don't want to keep using the old ones.
[00:38:06.527 --> 00:38:09.649]  So, we've got all that going on.
[00:38:14.232 --> 00:38:16.813]  And we've got them trying to shut everybody down.
[00:38:17.774 --> 00:38:19.674]  Now think about how crazy that is.
[00:38:19.974 --> 00:38:22.676]  And Democrat senators saying, we're going to shut everybody down.
[00:38:22.976 --> 00:38:23.776]  Where's Congress?
[00:38:23.836 --> 00:38:24.496]  Where are the hearings?
[00:38:24.796 --> 00:38:25.917]  Where is everybody up in arms?
[00:38:26.717 --> 00:38:30.099]  So you got Jack Dorsey going on Sean Hannity's radio show going, I'm your friend.
[00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:30.599]  Don't run.
[00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:31.399]  We are your friends.
[00:38:31.819 --> 00:38:33.280]  Everything's fine, President Trump.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:41.103]  Don't have a criminal investigation for Federal Elections Commission violations that we're blocking all the conservatives ahead of the campaign right into the midterms.
[00:38:41.924 --> 00:38:42.684]  We have them!
[00:38:46.434 --> 00:38:48.715]  And Dorsey's people are like, Dorsey, you've sold out!
[00:38:48.755 --> 00:38:49.875]  We want him banned right now!
[00:38:49.895 --> 00:38:52.476]  And he's like, I was the vanguard of censorship, idiots!
[00:38:52.696 --> 00:38:53.397]  We went too far!
[00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:53.937]  Shut up!
[00:38:54.597 --> 00:38:55.257]  They're on us!
[00:38:55.977 --> 00:38:57.578]  God Almighty, we'll get Jones later.
[00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:02.580]  And then the frothing reports.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.881]  The frothing reports everywhere.
[00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:08.502]  About how I need to be taken off the air.
[00:39:08.802 --> 00:39:09.962]  How I need to be shut down.
[00:39:10.263 --> 00:39:11.403]  How I'm the devil incarnate.
[00:39:11.643 --> 00:39:13.964]  How I'm the worst thing since the devil was born.
[00:39:16.633 --> 00:39:18.213]  By so-called liberal journalists.
[00:39:18.533 --> 00:39:19.874]  These people are authoritarians.
[00:39:20.094 --> 00:39:22.714]  Because China runs Google.
[00:39:22.794 --> 00:39:24.814]  It runs Apple now.
[00:39:24.954 --> 00:39:26.435]  The others want entree into it.
[00:39:26.655 --> 00:39:33.656]  So they're hiring people and training people who are SJWs, trained in Maoist philosophy at the universities, as the operating system.
[00:39:33.856 --> 00:39:34.896]  That isn't by accident.
[00:39:35.096 --> 00:39:42.678]  All 50 state-run colleges that came out, even in the Washington Post, are run by the Chai Koms.
[00:39:43.058 --> 00:39:44.358]  This is a takeover!
[00:39:46.206 --> 00:39:48.108]  The Antifa are malice youth brigades.
[00:39:48.508 --> 00:39:49.730]  All of it is a plan.
[00:39:52.392 --> 00:39:55.235]  So if you go to InfoWars.com, we have the Steve Watson article breaking it down.
[00:39:55.676 --> 00:40:01.762]  Apple says it's monitoring the InfoWars app, threatens to censor it if it becomes harmful.
[00:40:03.264 --> 00:40:04.845]  Imagine aliens show up to see the earth.
[00:40:05.886 --> 00:40:06.227]  They say,
[00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:12.493]  From a million megameters, we judge that your planet is evil and threatening.
[00:40:12.973 --> 00:40:15.094]  Stand by for planetary destruction.
[00:40:15.675 --> 00:40:16.275]  Thank you.
[00:40:17.656 --> 00:40:18.837]  We find you harmful.
[00:40:19.598 --> 00:40:21.079]  It's a subjective term, we find.
[00:40:21.739 --> 00:40:22.580]  We don't like you.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.081]  We say you're hateful.
[00:40:24.481 --> 00:40:25.562]  We say you're bad.
[00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:27.043]  We don't show how that is.
[00:40:27.343 --> 00:40:28.163]  We don't convict you.
[00:40:28.203 --> 00:40:29.104]  We don't prove it in court.
[00:40:29.624 --> 00:40:32.106]  Sure, we sue you as the proof, just like Mueller indicts.
[00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:33.167]  That's the proof you're Russian.
[00:40:34.847 --> 00:40:36.328]  We control reality now.
[00:40:36.408 --> 00:40:38.090]  We are your political masters.
[00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.811]  We will teach you how to deceive.
[00:40:39.851 --> 00:40:40.932]  We will teach you the tricks.
[00:40:41.432 --> 00:40:44.875]  If you good earthlings join us, some of you may be able to leave with us.
[00:40:45.515 --> 00:40:46.596]  I'm doing an allegory now.
[00:40:46.636 --> 00:40:49.278]  I don't mean aliens are really about to destroy the planet, but imagine.
[00:40:52.221 --> 00:40:56.924]  After BuzzFeed and others reach out to them, they say, why is it he banned off this?
[00:40:57.605 --> 00:40:58.666]  Why do you even allow him to have an app?
[00:40:59.465 --> 00:41:03.447]  They go, well, we were streaming his services and placing it in our index.
[00:41:03.467 --> 00:41:06.889]  We've de-indexed him, but the app, just like a website, allows you to go to him.
[00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:09.550]  And, you know, that's kind of real racketeering if we do that.
[00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:15.593]  They're like, but don't worry, we're monitoring it, just like you monitor China, where Apple is now run by.
[00:41:15.613 --> 00:41:22.637]  And they said, five months ago in Reuters, that the Chinese government now runs Apple and is helping round up political dissidence and has the keys to the iCloud.
[00:41:22.677 --> 00:41:24.218]  So, I'm going to give you the headline here.
[00:41:25.444 --> 00:41:29.634]  Communist China, now in control of Apple, calls for Alex Jones to be banned.
[00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:33.524]  And they're just having a discourse and debate to see if Americans wake up.
[00:41:34.366 --> 00:41:36.266]  And they're like, OK, we may ban him.
[00:41:36.486 --> 00:41:37.947]  We're listening to him.
[00:41:38.367 --> 00:41:39.547]  We're watching him.
[00:41:39.967 --> 00:41:41.748]  We're listening to Alex Jones right now.
[00:41:42.388 --> 00:41:43.228]  Of course you are!
[00:41:43.328 --> 00:41:44.708]  You know, you sold out.
[00:41:44.948 --> 00:41:50.809]  You've got suicide factories, suicide nets, forced abortion, forced drugging, 18-hour workdays at Foxconn.
[00:41:50.989 --> 00:41:51.710]  You're monsters!
[00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.170]  You help round up Falun Gong and Christians and sell their organs!
[00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.031]  So of course you're introducing us to a social score.
[00:41:58.291 --> 00:42:03.653]  You're introducing us to the bad man who you first demonized for years to now sell America on this crap!
[00:42:03.873 --> 00:42:05.754]  But America is going to figure it out!
[00:42:05.954 --> 00:42:12.916]  And you're going to get your asses busted up in trust-busting and national security, and when it's all over, it'll be like World War II.
[00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:17.198]  People will ask, how the hell did they get so many Americans to join the Nazi side?
[00:42:19.338 --> 00:42:19.858]  Same deal.
[00:42:19.898 --> 00:42:20.979]  So good luck, busters.
[00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:24.340]  And then CNN's sitting there foaming at the mouth.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.640]  Get him off the air.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.441]  Get him off the air.
[00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:27.001]  Imagine.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.291]  Apple openly censoring, openly spying on the iCloud.
[00:42:32.632 --> 00:42:33.575]  They told Reuters, they go...
[00:42:34.574 --> 00:42:37.736]  Well, when you're based in China, the government's embedded with you, and that's just how it is.
[00:42:38.177 --> 00:42:39.838]  And now the Chinese government runs Apple.
[00:42:39.858 --> 00:42:40.559]  We're tax-exempt.
[00:42:40.899 --> 00:42:41.960]  So they get more money!
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.281]  Now Tim Cook's a trillion-dollar company.
[00:42:44.321 --> 00:42:44.842]  Yay!
[00:42:45.082 --> 00:42:46.123]  Based on slavery!
[00:42:46.623 --> 00:42:54.249]  He's funding Black Lives Matter, teaching them about 160 years ago, so that you only think about the past, not what he's currently doing now.
[00:42:54.289 --> 00:42:54.889]  But don't worry.
[00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.351]  Tim Cook and the Chinese are set to ban us.
[00:42:57.571 --> 00:42:58.132]  Don't worry!
[00:43:02.679 --> 00:43:08.300]  Together we're going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities.
[00:43:08.801 --> 00:43:15.102]  And we're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel MS-13 and many other gangs.
[00:43:16.282 --> 00:43:19.303]  But MS-13 is particularly violent.
[00:43:20.043 --> 00:43:22.604]  They don't like shooting people because it's too quick.
[00:43:23.344 --> 00:43:24.204]  It's too fast.
[00:43:25.064 --> 00:43:30.646]  I was reading one of these animals was caught and explaining they like to knife them and cut them.
[00:43:31.673 --> 00:43:37.119]  And let him die slowly because that way it's more painful and they enjoy watching that much more.
[00:43:37.159 --> 00:43:37.920]  These are animals.
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.102]  Did you hear him call MS-13 animals?
[00:43:40.202 --> 00:43:40.863]  Yes, I did.
[00:43:40.903 --> 00:43:41.764]  What did you think about that?
[00:43:42.024 --> 00:43:42.905]  I think he's a pig.
[00:43:43.846 --> 00:43:44.487]  An animal.
[00:43:44.527 --> 00:43:45.989]  I mean, you know, you smell your own, I guess.
[00:43:46.009 --> 00:43:48.051]  Maybe not all people in that group are animals.
[00:43:48.371 --> 00:43:49.512]  No, they're not animals at all.
[00:43:49.532 --> 00:43:50.933]  They're human beings just like all of us.
[00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:52.094]  I think he's a pig.
[00:43:52.394 --> 00:43:58.218]  He's just using that as an excuse to, I don't know, justify his being such a racist.
[00:43:58.399 --> 00:44:01.081]  And then this week Trump made the comment about MS-13 being animals.
[00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:01.681]  Did you hear about that?
[00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:02.381]  I did.
[00:44:02.402 --> 00:44:03.382]  What do you think about that?
[00:44:03.402 --> 00:44:07.365]  I think he's criticizing his own American people.
[00:44:07.465 --> 00:44:08.726]  What can you say about this guy?
[00:44:08.786 --> 00:44:09.407]  He's the animal.
[00:44:10.287 --> 00:44:12.549]  Would you agree that not all MS-13 members are animals?
[00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:13.350]  Absolutely.
[00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:14.031]  Cool.
[00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:15.452]  And then, um, it kind of, yeah, exactly.
[00:44:15.472 --> 00:44:18.174]  It's just like a negative, always negative in the news, always negative in the news.
[00:44:18.194 --> 00:44:21.297]  The guys that are running around gangbanging, killing people, they're animals.
[00:44:21.858 --> 00:44:22.098]  You know?
[00:44:22.579 --> 00:44:25.201]  But the rest of the gang, it's a big gang, you know?
[00:44:25.541 --> 00:44:29.125]  I can't decide whether I should laugh at this or it's like a punch to my gut.
[00:44:30.485 --> 00:44:31.885]  Yeah, I feel the same way.
[00:44:32.105 --> 00:44:34.566]  And I feel like it's a punch to the gut a lot of times.
[00:44:35.846 --> 00:44:43.608]  And people with that last video, a lot of them say, oh, you probably interviewed a ton of people and picked the five people that actually supported MS-13.
[00:44:44.128 --> 00:44:48.029]  And Owen, I swear to you, those are the five people I interviewed.
[00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:49.549]  Those were the five reactions.
[00:44:49.649 --> 00:44:50.690]  I went five for five.
[00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.810]  Every single person I asked, MS-13, are they animals?
[00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:56.571]  Every single person I asked in West Hollywood said no.
[00:44:57.271 --> 00:44:58.171]  So it's scary.
[00:44:58.211 --> 00:45:07.934]  We're in a really weird spot right now where the left, just to spite Trump, is doubling down on things that are in no way at all American or American values.
[00:45:07.994 --> 00:45:17.416]  And I think one of the only reasons the left is able to get away with these ridiculous stories, these ridiculous claims, is because their base audience has such a short attention span.
[00:45:18.056 --> 00:45:21.581]  So they basically engineered, like, the perfect resistor in a way.
[00:45:21.601 --> 00:45:25.706]  It's people with short attention spans, people that don't actually pay attention to politics.
[00:45:25.787 --> 00:45:33.397]  A lot of times they think they're educated because they went to college and are in debt, and for that reason they feel like they're oppressed and they know more than everybody.
[00:45:34.057 --> 00:45:37.639]  And a lot of what we're seeing now, I think, is going beyond politics.
[00:45:37.699 --> 00:45:40.221]  I think it's basically coming down to good versus evil.
[00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:43.943]  And I think it's coming down to establishment versus anti-establishment.
[00:45:44.343 --> 00:45:55.590]  And it's scary to see the left head in this direction because not too long ago, liberals were the ones who were for free speech, who were against censorship, who wanted to expose government corruption.
[00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:58.152]  And now we're seeing them side with things that
[00:45:58.812 --> 00:46:04.374]  I don't think anyone should ever side with, and it's just at a base level, anti, you know, un-American, anti-American.
[00:46:04.434 --> 00:46:24.100]  But I think the good news is, every time the left takes a stand and supports MS-13, or, you know, promotes the Me Too movement, meanwhile they're all sexual predators in Hollywood, and every time they take a stand and contradict themselves, I think their audience shrinks just a little bit, and it's the people in the middle, the rational people, the centrists,
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:31.865]  The independents, the maybe even classical liberals, who are now looking around and saying, wait, why is my party defending MS-13?
[00:46:32.285 --> 00:46:35.367]  Why are we pretending that Hollywood isn't a toxic culture?
[00:46:35.727 --> 00:46:39.909]  And these are the people that are going to start heading to the right, just like we're seeing, you know, across the board.
[00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:48.875]  So while the far left will always be the far left and the protesters will always be pretty much brainwashed and convinced that Trump is the devil himself,
[00:46:49.435 --> 00:46:55.964]  Everyone else in the middle who is somewhat rational will start waking up and their audience I think is shrinking by the day for that reason.
[00:47:04.175 --> 00:47:06.778]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:19.947 --> 00:47:22.835]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[00:47:23.076 --> 00:47:26.004]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.241 --> 00:47:36.182]  So, it's a major national security issue that Apple officially announced five months ago.
[00:47:36.222 --> 00:47:40.263]  They're Chinese Communist-run, and they're helping censor and control the Chinese people.
[00:47:40.603 --> 00:47:46.285]  And the main iCloud keys to the entire planet are now state-run by the Chai-coms.
[00:47:46.645 --> 00:47:48.345]  The Communist Chinese own our national debt.
[00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:51.766]  They control all six of the major movie houses in Hollywood.
[00:47:52.646 --> 00:47:54.508]  It's been all over the news that they run Hollywood now.
[00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:57.952]  They control most of the major universities with their infiltration.
[00:47:58.613 --> 00:47:59.994]  They control Silicon Valley.
[00:48:00.034 --> 00:48:01.716]  There's even been Politico articles about that.
[00:48:02.297 --> 00:48:13.248]  And now Tim Cook, who has the most debilitated, horrible factories in the world that he subcontracts with, Foxconn, Suicide Nets, all of it, he is literally moving to banish
[00:48:13.969 --> 00:48:24.001]  Not just off of the iTunes streams where we were in the top ten, but now our app that we just launched three weeks ago has gone to number one in both areas, but off and on they don't even list it.
[00:48:25.122 --> 00:48:34.433]  And there are five InfoWars apps, a bunch of them aren't ours, that are in the top hundred and they're moving to delist all of those.
[00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:39.227]  And announcing that they're monitoring us and watching us.
[00:48:39.327 --> 00:48:40.867]  So, there you go.
[00:48:40.927 --> 00:48:51.371]  And China threatened yesterday to take over Apple and Apple factories and shut down Apple factories in China if Trump continued to stand up against their trade war against us.
[00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:53.251]  Did you hear that?
[00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:55.712]  Did you hear that?
[00:48:59.353 --> 00:48:59.993]  Think about that.
[00:49:00.593 --> 00:49:01.394]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:49:01.674 --> 00:49:05.815]  Communist China openly announced
[00:49:07.327 --> 00:49:15.913]  Yesterday, that they would take over Apple and shut down production if Trump didn't submit an internal embargo by a so-called U.S.
[00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.735]  company that's now Chinese state-run.
[00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:20.877]  And now you understand what's really going on.
[00:49:21.217 --> 00:49:30.564]  And they're using me, who they first demonized to the public in psychological warfare, as the test case to go, well, that Alex Jones, you know, the straw man I heard about him, nobody says that.
[00:49:30.584 --> 00:49:31.825]  They go, oh, that's a bad guy.
[00:49:33.427 --> 00:49:41.673]  You know, he said Trump would win, he believes in the Second Amendment, and he doesn't believe every official government story, and he's restoring the Republic, and he's standing firm under the attacks.
[00:49:41.793 --> 00:49:45.615]  Yeah, I want to virtue signal at the bar or work.
[00:49:45.655 --> 00:49:46.676]  Yeah, he's a bad guy.
[00:49:47.837 --> 00:49:48.997]  And they go, oh, thank you.
[00:49:49.538 --> 00:49:52.960]  And then Senator Murphy comes out and says, we're going to ban all conservatives offline.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.182]  It's for the future of our democracy that your speech be banned.
[00:49:57.623 --> 00:49:59.645]  That's the weird, sick ways they talk.
[00:49:59.945 --> 00:50:01.466]  The weird, sick things they do.
[00:50:03.746 --> 00:50:17.971]  When we come back and start the next hour, Paul Watson's put out a powerful report that's on Infowars.com where they're threatening to arrest former mayor of London because he said there's burqas everywhere, these women have been enslaved, and that Saudi Arabia is trying to get rid of burqas.
[00:50:17.991 --> 00:50:27.294]  We went from, like, trying to pressure Saudi Arabia to stop it, not letting women drive or go to college, and killing them if they poorly looked at another man, to, like, no, it's good!
[00:50:27.694 --> 00:50:29.635]  Teach the children how great it is!
[00:50:31.675 --> 00:50:32.776]  Like, they're talking about banning
[00:50:33.962 --> 00:50:35.983]  The former liberal mayor off Twitter right now.
[00:50:36.003 --> 00:50:39.564]  In fact, the virtue-signalers there at Twitter are talking about it.
[00:50:40.665 --> 00:50:47.328]  So... That's the point that we've gotten to.
[00:50:49.733 --> 00:50:50.934]  As a society and a culture.
[00:50:50.955 --> 00:50:56.461]  But listen, people say, well why do you even launch an app on iTunes and on Droid?
[00:50:57.342 --> 00:50:58.163]  They're going to censor you.
[00:50:58.203 --> 00:51:00.105]  Because that's where the commerce is.
[00:51:00.546 --> 00:51:01.927]  That's where the ideas are.
[00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:04.770]  That's the open marketplace of ideas.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:15.791]  It's like asking a Jew in Nazi Germany in 1933, why'd you try to go run an office space and be a lawyer or be a mathematician or be a seamstress?
[00:51:16.211 --> 00:51:17.252]  You're like, well that's what I do.
[00:51:17.272 --> 00:51:19.435]  I'm gonna get a little shop and I'm gonna sew clothes.
[00:51:19.455 --> 00:51:21.177]  They're like, you're evil!
[00:51:21.977 --> 00:51:23.800]  You don't get to have a job.
[00:51:24.801 --> 00:51:26.463]  We've been banned off LinkedIn, everything.
[00:51:27.572 --> 00:51:31.435]  They're depersoning us, depersoning us, right on 1984.
[00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:36.358]  And it's being done as the big beta test, and it is a mega, mega, mega outrage.
[00:51:36.399 --> 00:51:43.404]  But they hope it gets lost with all the other outrage, and that Congress doesn't figure it out, and the President doesn't figure it out.
[00:51:43.704 --> 00:51:46.666]  We are under attack by China and the collaborators.
[00:51:48.207 --> 00:51:49.568]  China runs Apple.
[00:51:49.948 --> 00:51:51.810]  Apple has already banned me off platforms.
[00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:56.213]  The Chinese government is silencing American members of the press.
[00:51:57.659 --> 00:52:00.884]  The Chinese government is silencing members of the U.S.
[00:52:00.924 --> 00:52:02.005]  press on record!
[00:52:03.728 --> 00:52:10.597]  They wouldn't even let Michael Savage publish his, he published it, they wouldn't let him put it in stores two years ago about the Chinese takeover of America!
[00:52:12.688 --> 00:52:14.649]  People ask me, how you takin' it bein' demonized?
[00:52:14.689 --> 00:52:16.089]  How you takin' it bein' lied about?
[00:52:16.129 --> 00:52:17.150]  How you takin' it bein' demonized?
[00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:26.954]  And I'm like, I'm in a war for the country with the chi-coms that have killed over 100 million of their own people, 80 plus million under Mao, that openly own Hollywood and are dead and are trying to silence me.
[00:52:28.014 --> 00:52:31.495]  Soldiers go off and fight and die, usually it's not even for our country, but they mean well.
[00:52:31.876 --> 00:52:37.598]  I'm here fighting for the real nation, against the globalists, for classical free speech.
[00:52:38.891 --> 00:52:40.831]  Of course enemy propaganda has demonized me.
[00:52:41.071 --> 00:52:50.793]  Of course enemy propaganda has twisted who I am and what I've said to then make me a champion of liberty who helped get Trump into office, who helped reboot the Republic, who helped relaunch 1776.
[00:52:51.693 --> 00:52:53.974]  A modern Paul Revere is what Infowars is.
[00:52:54.354 --> 00:52:57.274]  Not me alone, all of us together are modern Paul Reveres.
[00:52:57.394 --> 00:53:03.055]  And they don't like that and they want it shut down and they want it shut down now.
[00:53:03.295 --> 00:53:06.656]  And look at these cowardly, unpopular, stupid twits.
[00:53:07.887 --> 00:53:10.249]  At the New York Times saying, he's been banned.
[00:53:10.329 --> 00:53:11.350]  Should he be banned more?
[00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:15.774]  And people are like, hell no, we shouldn't be banned at all.
[00:53:16.314 --> 00:53:17.736]  78% say you're totally wrong.
[00:53:17.976 --> 00:53:20.378]  Another 10% say you're pretty much wrong.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.562]  They can only get a few percentage points to support me being banned.
[00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:26.924]  That's got to freak them out.
[00:53:29.586 --> 00:53:31.708]  Just because of their own little bubble chambers.
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:36.804]  They got into it, doesn't mean everybody else is into it.
[00:53:36.864 --> 00:53:44.672]  So yes, do I have to put myself in the center of the arena and take the most flack and the most fire to do this?
[00:53:44.712 --> 00:53:46.194]  But that was the plan.
[00:53:46.734 --> 00:53:48.876]  And it's not called trolling, it's called being a man.
[00:53:49.784 --> 00:53:50.504]  I feel good.
[00:53:50.564 --> 00:53:51.645]  My morale is good.
[00:53:51.785 --> 00:53:52.566]  I am strong.
[00:53:52.846 --> 00:53:57.608]  The more I'm persecuted, the stronger I get, because I understand it means I'm going into the furnace.
[00:53:57.928 --> 00:54:00.330]  I'm going into the point-blank-range operation.
[00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:01.490]  I'm charging the hill.
[00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:05.252]  I've already taken out 50 machine gun nests, and I'm almost at the top.
[00:54:05.492 --> 00:54:06.373]  We're almost there.
[00:54:06.573 --> 00:54:07.093]  And you know what?
[00:54:07.113 --> 00:54:11.555]  No matter what happens to me, there's millions of people screaming behind me, and we're going over the top.
[00:54:11.816 --> 00:54:12.616]  Nothing's stopping us.
[00:54:13.076 --> 00:54:16.238]  And I know that metaphysically and spiritually, and I'm aligned with God.
[00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:21.032]  And I know none of us get out of this alive, so I'm not worried.
[00:54:22.093 --> 00:54:35.240]  Now, they're not going to be able to stay on the app going to number one, so they'll either delist it, like they did when I was number one on Joe Rogan Show, number one podcast in history, they just delisted it.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.281]  They'll probably just delist it because it's so embarrassing.
[00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.922]  And then, like, kick users off, you'll have to resubscribe.
[00:54:40.502 --> 00:54:42.203]  Probably give them ideas, but that's how they operate.
[00:54:42.784 --> 00:54:45.605]  Congressional hearings, though, can subpoena that, and we're moving in that direction.
[00:54:46.245 --> 00:54:47.206]  Being very strategic, though.
[00:54:48.356 --> 00:54:49.977]  Look, we're already number one in just a few days.
[00:54:50.017 --> 00:54:51.638]  It took everybody else years to get up there.
[00:54:51.998 --> 00:54:53.639]  Number one in a couple days.
[00:54:54.039 --> 00:54:55.300]  It backfired again.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.602]  So don't worry about the app.
[00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:01.223]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:55:01.343 --> 00:55:03.384]  Go subscribe directly to the podcast.
[00:55:03.484 --> 00:55:03.985]  It's free!
[00:55:05.131 --> 00:55:05.831]  It's free.
[00:55:06.692 --> 00:55:07.372]  It's free.
[00:55:08.673 --> 00:55:09.313]  It's free.
[00:55:10.194 --> 00:55:10.814]  It's free.
[00:55:11.635 --> 00:55:12.975]  Hear what you're not supposed to hear.
[00:55:13.215 --> 00:55:15.677]  And once you download it on Android or App, tell folks about it.
[00:55:15.697 --> 00:55:23.801]  But more importantly, Infowars.com, 4SlushShow, David Knight's program, Roger Stone and Owen Schroyer's War Room, my broadcast.
[00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:26.603]  It's all there.
[00:55:26.643 --> 00:55:32.726]  And then finally, the biggest thing at the end of the day that fights the bullies, that fights the tyrants, that fights the control freaks,
[00:55:34.133 --> 00:55:36.654]  Is what you do when you support us financially.
[00:55:37.154 --> 00:55:38.614]  And you get great products at the same time.
[00:55:38.654 --> 00:55:44.435]  You can make a straight donation at InfoWars.com forward slash store.
[00:55:44.555 --> 00:55:47.256]  Or you just go to InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:55:48.516 --> 00:55:49.097]  Those really help.
[00:55:49.137 --> 00:55:49.417]  Thank you.
[00:55:49.437 --> 00:55:50.757]  A lot of donations coming in.
[00:55:50.797 --> 00:55:54.718]  But in the aggregate, it's not like you're getting great products you're going to enjoy.
[00:55:54.738 --> 00:55:55.778]  They're going to make your life better.
[00:55:56.098 --> 00:55:57.378]  That you then sign up for auto ship.
[00:55:57.398 --> 00:55:57.799]  It's free.
[00:55:57.819 --> 00:55:58.899]  You get an additional 10% off.
[00:56:01.101 --> 00:56:03.122]  We also have free shipping going right now.
[00:56:04.063 --> 00:56:05.084]  On orders of $10 and up.
[00:56:05.124 --> 00:56:06.384]  In fact, orders of $5.
[00:56:07.565 --> 00:56:08.406]  Free shipping storewide.
[00:56:08.946 --> 00:56:13.449]  And you can get Winter Sun, Secret 12, DNA Force, 50% off.
[00:56:13.489 --> 00:56:15.550]  Survival Silodex 2, 40% off.
[00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:17.211]  Alpha Power is incredible, 50% off.
[00:56:17.531 --> 00:56:25.997]  But if everybody just commits to get the Colloidal Silver Iodine Fortified Fluoride Free Super Blue Toothpaste for adults, children, immune gargle, mouthwash, six different products,
[00:56:26.457 --> 00:56:34.882]  If you just get that and sign up for AutoShip and see how great it is, or buy it once, if you like it, sign up for AutoShip, and then get it each month, or every 60 or 90 days, however you want.
[00:56:37.324 --> 00:56:38.265]  And sell any time!
[00:56:39.147 --> 00:56:45.831]  If you just make that financial commitment, get a 360 win and get good products, great products at the same time, you cannot lose.
[00:56:46.271 --> 00:56:47.412]  So get DNA Force.
[00:56:47.732 --> 00:56:58.278]  Experience the PQQ, the BioQ10 and all of it at a price and a concentration where it's sold in medical type deals for $300, $400 right now on discount.
[00:56:58.358 --> 00:56:58.738]  It's $74.95.
[00:56:58.778 --> 00:57:03.621]  That's our big expensive flagship product because there's like 40-something bucks of product in each bottle.
[00:57:03.661 --> 00:57:05.842]  I mean, nobody puts out stuff like this.
[00:57:05.882 --> 00:57:06.623]  This is unbelievable.
[00:57:08.624 --> 00:57:11.346]  A lot of these products are $19.95, some are $9.95.
[00:57:12.486 --> 00:57:16.908]  But DNA Force is something special, and we buy a lot more of it, so we're able to lower the price of it from $140 to normally $99.
[00:57:16.989 --> 00:57:21.731]  But right now, it is $70 at mfullerstore.com or mfullerslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:24.312]  They think America's going down without a fight.
[00:57:29.235 --> 00:57:31.258]  They think they're gonna just push us aside easily?
[00:57:31.718 --> 00:57:31.938]  No!
[00:57:32.038 --> 00:57:40.408]  We have victory in our blood, we have destiny in our heart, we have will in our soul, and we will never back down and never get in!
[00:57:40.729 --> 00:57:44.273]  In fact, as they can see, the Warhammer's ready!
[00:57:44.533 --> 00:57:47.257]  We are energizing towards the main collision!
[00:57:50.135 --> 00:57:54.519]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:58:00.164]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:05.248]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[00:58:06.129 --> 00:58:07.851]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[00:58:11.716 --> 00:58:16.220]  Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:21.003]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[00:58:21.323 --> 00:58:25.386]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[00:58:28.209 --> 00:58:31.371]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[00:58:42.299 --> 00:58:44.440]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:49.481]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[00:58:50.142 --> 00:58:51.322]  He's not a politician.
[00:58:52.142 --> 00:58:52.822]  He's one of us.
[00:58:55.323 --> 00:58:57.484]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[00:58:59.965 --> 00:59:02.445]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:07.487]  Embrace that label, because it's the outsiders who change the world.
[00:59:08.803 --> 00:59:11.024]  It'll make a real and lasting difference.
[00:59:11.444 --> 00:59:17.026]  Treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation.
[00:59:18.066 --> 00:59:20.407]  Three American hostages are back home.
[00:59:20.927 --> 00:59:25.369]  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
[00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:33.091]  Seize this moment, believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe once more in America.
[00:59:34.072 --> 00:59:37.953]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body,
[00:59:39.318 --> 00:59:42.619]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[00:59:43.059 --> 00:59:45.560]  The forgotten man and the forgotten woman.
[00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:48.981]  You're not forgotten anymore.
[00:59:49.001 --> 00:59:57.944]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:11.494]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.183]  If you understand psychological warfare and have studied it like I've done as a layperson,
[01:00:27.699 --> 01:00:34.328]  And you see how they try to lull you into an NPR sleep and how they have all these voices and all this chatter where people don't take anything serious anymore.
[01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:36.892]  They're putting you into a kind of stasis.
[01:00:38.734 --> 01:00:41.157]  That's why occasionally it's important for me to do something like this.
[01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:45.232]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:53.040]  resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:00:54.001 --> 01:00:56.484]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:00:56.504 --> 01:00:57.985]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:00:58.326 --> 01:01:00.248]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:01:00.488 --> 01:01:02.590]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:03.891]  This is all confirmed.
[01:01:03.932 --> 01:01:04.852]  This is not a drill.
[01:01:05.888 --> 01:01:09.853]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:01:10.154 --> 01:01:11.575]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:01:11.716 --> 01:01:11.976]  Apple 100%.
[01:01:12.156 --> 01:01:18.865]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:01:19.265 --> 01:01:24.012]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:01:25.373 --> 01:01:26.854]  So to break through, I'm going to say it like this.
[01:01:27.294 --> 01:01:30.256]  The Communist Chinese are the biggest mass murderers in history.
[01:01:30.616 --> 01:01:36.599]  They are now allied with Juncker and the EU, radical Islam, Hollywood, and the big banks to break the US.
[01:01:36.899 --> 01:01:39.280]  They've openly bragged about this at Davos.
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.742]  The Communist Chinese are now pressuring...
[01:01:42.987 --> 01:01:48.871]  Tim Cook to totally kick us off the app on iPhone that is now number one in news.
[01:01:49.212 --> 01:01:51.854]  They are officially saying they are monitoring us.
[01:01:52.274 --> 01:01:54.376]  Apple says they are watching me.
[01:01:54.456 --> 01:01:54.696]  Remember?
[01:01:54.956 --> 01:01:56.697]  Big Brother's watching you.
[01:01:57.018 --> 01:01:58.599]  You're not allowed to hear the hate.
[01:02:00.745 --> 01:02:02.806]  Because when you tune in, it's not hate.
[01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.467]  It makes perfect sense.
[01:02:05.348 --> 01:02:19.316]  And it's a bunch of Hispanics, blacks, whites, Asians, all hugging each other and loving prosperity in America, while meth-head-looking antifa rats, who are almost all white, run around screaming Nazi over and over again because they're projecting.
[01:02:19.716 --> 01:02:20.857]  We are winning.
[01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:31.923]  The globalists are panicking, but they are moving against the internet ahead of the midterms and are practicing major cyber attacks on Infowars and now announcing it under Senator Murphy for others.
[01:02:32.003 --> 01:02:32.984]  This is treason.
[01:02:33.304 --> 01:02:34.185]  This is happening.
[01:02:34.225 --> 01:02:42.129]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:02:42.229 --> 01:02:48.173]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:02:48.553 --> 01:02:59.081]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, parallax view, paradigm manipulation.
[01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:03.445]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:03:03.725 --> 01:03:06.927]  We adapt to being pressed at the low dosages of oppression.
[01:03:08.068 --> 01:03:17.936]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:03:19.318 --> 01:03:29.689]  It's just like the Russians would march people out who were on death row every day and not let them know they were going to be shot in the back of the head so when it came it wouldn't be an issue and they would be in total control.
[01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:31.091]  It's the same thing.
[01:03:31.171 --> 01:03:33.754]  They are making their move right now.
[01:03:33.814 --> 01:03:37.638]  The Chinese company run by their government that is actually in control of
[01:03:38.519 --> 01:03:41.600]  Apple, and in control of Google, is called Skynet.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.301]  It is a panopticonic, total, Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[01:03:48.621 --> 01:04:04.265]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program, and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Com slash Big Tech banking combine emergency situation.
[01:04:04.605 --> 01:04:09.847]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information, and I've been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:04:10.867 --> 01:04:19.590]  They want to double-use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:24.532]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:04:24.892 --> 01:04:29.794]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:04:30.174 --> 01:04:37.976]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:04:38.316 --> 01:04:45.018]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:04:45.478 --> 01:04:50.820]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.781]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:04:56.001 --> 01:04:57.842]  I have given you the transmission.
[01:04:57.862 --> 01:04:58.902]  Now break free!
[01:05:04.537 --> 01:05:04.998]  Have you heard?
[01:05:05.478 --> 01:05:07.541]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[01:05:07.641 --> 01:05:08.943]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[01:05:09.123 --> 01:05:10.144]  They're all censoring us.
[01:05:10.525 --> 01:05:16.412]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:19.737]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.

[01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:47.565]  The new InfoWars hexagon logo.
[01:05:47.765 --> 01:05:49.687]  Very, very cool logo.
[01:05:50.127 --> 01:05:55.831]  And kind of more discreet, so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:58.973]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:58.993 --> 01:06:00.454]  Huge discount store-wide right now.
[01:06:13.964 --> 01:06:18.087]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:06:18.828 --> 01:06:20.389]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:22.991]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:06:23.311 --> 01:06:27.755]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:33.199]  You can't deny that David Rockefeller and his father were visionaries of evil.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.160]  Their vision only eclipsed by their true wickedness.
[01:06:37.821 --> 01:06:44.503]  Seeing the communist Chinese, all 600 million of them in 1949, backing Mao Zedong to power.
[01:06:45.223 --> 01:06:46.824]  No running water, basically, in the country.
[01:06:48.464 --> 01:06:49.345]  No major medicine.
[01:06:49.985 --> 01:06:50.225]  Now!
[01:06:52.484 --> 01:06:55.046]  75, 80 years later, they are the economic super house.
[01:06:55.186 --> 01:06:56.366]  Everything's been transferred to them.
[01:06:56.406 --> 01:06:57.147]  They own our debt.
[01:06:57.167 --> 01:06:57.967]  They own our media.
[01:06:58.227 --> 01:06:59.948]  They've been given the code keys to everything.
[01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:02.990]  And in the final minutes of the fall of the republic...
[01:07:03.823 --> 01:07:16.094]  Trump comes in in a desperate, some would say, negotiation strategy, because we had to pivot even under traitor behavior, because China was totally screwing off, screwing over the globalists, and not even paying their money to sell America out.
[01:07:16.474 --> 01:07:19.336]  So Obama kind of got in a stance like, hey, whoa, we had a deal.
[01:07:19.356 --> 01:07:23.620]  That's when the Pentagon went, we're not doing this plan anymore, and why are you backing the radical Islamists?
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.242]  So we went into a stasis point.
[01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.744]  And that's why Trump's actually in there.
[01:07:29.164 --> 01:07:34.886]  And he believes he can restore the republic and negotiate a real deal and get China off our back because we hold all the keys.
[01:07:34.946 --> 01:07:41.508]  But these people are all traitors and have an innate hatred of America because it's innately powerful and free and Christian.
[01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:52.893]  So because the globalists have an operating system of evil, they cannot even take the power they would actually get from commanding a real republic because they don't want to command freedom.
[01:07:53.593 --> 01:07:54.754]  They can't command freedom.
[01:07:54.834 --> 01:07:55.534]  It threatens them.
[01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:57.636]  They can only command your enslavement.
[01:07:58.296 --> 01:08:05.741]  Now, we take you to London, England, where the former mayor has been threatened with arrest for criticizing the armies of women in their slave chattel uniforms.
[01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:07.082]  We now take you live.
[01:08:07.582 --> 01:08:08.483]  We now take you to London.
[01:08:09.963 --> 01:08:12.305]  The absolute state of the UK.
[01:08:12.365 --> 01:08:27.317]  So Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, writes an article for The Telegraph in which he argues against banning the burqa, but says in this article that women in burqas look like bank robbers and look like letterboxes.
[01:08:27.657 --> 01:08:31.981]  And the gelded, castrated, conservative-in-name-only party
[01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:35.484]  ...launches an investigation into his comments.
[01:08:35.764 --> 01:08:41.129]  Theresa May, a useless, pathetic leader, demands he apologize.
[01:08:41.489 --> 01:08:50.297]  The UK's chief police officer, Cressida Dick, orders the police to look into his comments for potential hate crimes.
[01:08:50.797 --> 01:08:57.542]  I mean, it's not like we've got a knife crime epidemic with young kids being stabbed to death almost every night at this point, is it?
[01:08:57.622 --> 01:08:58.563]  Not like that's happening.
[01:08:58.583 --> 01:09:01.325]  It's not like acid attacks are occurring across the country.
[01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:02.807]  It's not like rape is up 20%.
[01:09:02.967 --> 01:09:07.090]  It's not like 97% of moped crime goes unpunished.
[01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:08.791]  No, that's not important.
[01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:13.435]  What's more important is Boris Johnson may have said some mean words.
[01:09:15.016 --> 01:09:19.840]  60% of the British people compared to 33% didn't think it was racist.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:24.663]  It's not racist anyway because Islam's not a race and the burqa is a piece of frigging clothing.
[01:09:25.264 --> 01:09:30.728]  So 60% say it's not racist but the Conservative Party investigates him anyway.
[01:09:30.908 --> 01:09:39.475]  They literally side with the 33% of hysterical idiots in the country that are never going to vote for them anyway to investigate his comments.
[01:09:39.935 --> 01:09:42.878]  Absolute unbridled stupidity.
[01:09:43.098 --> 01:09:56.051]  Maybe, just maybe, Conservative Party, if you cared more about, oh, I don't know, fulfilling the democratic mandate which the British people gave you, with Brexit, instead of making a complete f***ing arse of it...
[01:09:56.972 --> 01:10:05.697]  Then you care over Boris Johnson's mean words, maybe you wouldn't be getting beaten in the polls by a complete frigging clown in Jeremy Corbyn.
[01:10:05.877 --> 01:10:08.778]  And here's the other irony, as Brendan O'Neill writes in spite.
[01:10:09.479 --> 01:10:15.382]  The very people who constantly kick up a fuss about repressive male behaviour are now up in arms about Boris.
[01:10:15.942 --> 01:10:36.022]  For talking about repressive male behaviour, the same tweeters and liberals and feminists who spent the past year of Me Too cheering the new public conversation about how awful men are, now want to shut down a public conversation about the possibility that some Muslim men might be awful too, and might be inflicting a repressive culture on women.
[01:10:36.522 --> 01:10:46.829]  Again, these are the same people who get upset about manspreading and mansplaining, meanwhile blaming the victims of Muslim grooming gangs for the way they dress.
[01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:49.311]  This is the horrific irony of this.
[01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:54.515]  Now a hundred women who wear the niqab al-Burqa demand Boris be kicked out of the Conservative Party.
[01:10:54.895 --> 01:11:01.380]  I mean, it's not like 60% of the British public, like 40 million people support Boris, a clear majority no.
[01:11:01.961 --> 01:11:06.604]  100 Muslim women have wrote a letter, so now I guess he has to go.
[01:11:06.884 --> 01:11:23.277]  So again, we see the left aligning with the more radical elements of Islamism to defend the burqa as some kind of women's rights feminist symbol, despite the historical fact that the very first feminist Arab Muslim group back in the 1920s
[01:11:24.798 --> 01:11:31.541]  Nearly a hundred years ago, the Egyptian Feminist Union made it their platform to get rid of the Islamic veil.
[01:11:31.781 --> 01:11:38.843]  They literally had protests where they removed their veils to protest against a brutal patriarchy.
[01:11:39.104 --> 01:11:42.565]  The same patriarchy which the left has now sided with.
[01:11:42.745 --> 01:11:44.607]  Look at women in Syria and Iraq.
[01:11:44.847 --> 01:11:48.050]  What do they do when ISIS leaves the area?
[01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:54.356]  The first thing they do is remove the veil, stamp on it, set it on fire, and celebrate.
[01:11:54.616 --> 01:11:55.637]  Look at Indonesia.
[01:11:55.957 --> 01:12:02.343]  Gangs of men with guns roaming around on behalf of the state, oppressing women who let their veil slip.
[01:12:03.104 --> 01:12:05.586]  Okay, this is the true nature of modesty culture.
[01:12:05.866 --> 01:12:07.948]  This is what the left is now supporting.
[01:12:08.228 --> 01:12:10.370]  Women and young girls in major European cities.
[01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:11.771]  This happened in Austria, Vienna.
[01:12:11.951 --> 01:12:16.114]  Being brutally attacked by gangs of men for not wearing the hijab.
[01:12:16.335 --> 01:12:19.637]  Women in Iran being sentenced to 20 years in prison.
[01:12:19.997 --> 01:12:25.662]  Oppressed, persecuted, tortured for removing their headscarves in public protests.
[01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:29.391]  And how did the left react to that when it was happening at the start of the year?
[01:12:29.992 --> 01:12:33.273]  Because I used an image from the protest that was four days old.
[01:12:33.693 --> 01:12:35.314]  It was a whopping four days old.
[01:12:35.354 --> 01:12:36.314]  It was the same protest.
[01:12:36.794 --> 01:12:39.795]  That was what BuzzFeed made the story about.
[01:12:40.416 --> 01:12:42.216]  This guy commented on it sardonically.
[01:12:42.516 --> 01:12:54.381]  People using a four-day-old image of a woman spurning the forced modesty culture of misogynistic death cult that we peddle to our virtue, signaling white guilt-ridden readership as empowering, and it's totally f***ing up our victim narrative.
[01:12:54.781 --> 01:13:01.446]  Listen to what Azran Amani, a Muslim reformist, says about hijab, niqab, burqa culture.
[01:13:01.846 --> 01:13:07.370]  This purity culture covers, segregates, subordinates, silences, jails and kills women and girls around the world.
[01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:17.778]  Recently in Bareilly, India, a father killed his daughter, four years old, smashing her head against the floor because her scarf slipped from her head during dinner.
[01:13:18.058 --> 01:13:21.701]  This is the true reality of this modesty hijab culture.
[01:13:22.181 --> 01:13:29.867]  In Ontario, Canada, a man strangled his 16-year-old sister when she defied their father, including by refusing to cover her hair.
[01:13:29.887 --> 01:13:30.428]  But that's liberal!
[01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:36.953]  A Missourian instructor dragged a female relative 14 out of school by the hair when he discovered she hadn't covered her hair.
[01:13:37.233 --> 01:13:38.674]  So, Boris Johnson's right.
[01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:41.496]  The clear majority of the British people are right.
[01:13:41.956 --> 01:13:47.821]  The hijab, burqa, niqab culture is patriarchal, it is brutal, it is oppressive.
[01:13:48.101 --> 01:13:50.982]  And pointing that out isn't a hate crime.
[01:13:51.383 --> 01:14:00.187]  As Sourabh Amari writes, the sight of the burqa in the public square crystallises the sense that European immigration and assimilation policy has gone horribly wrong.
[01:14:00.587 --> 01:14:04.429]  Concluding that this is so isn't tantamount to hatred.
[01:14:04.889 --> 01:14:06.650]  And that's what they want to hide.
[01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:11.112]  They don't want to address the fact that integration, that mass migration, isn't working.
[01:14:11.412 --> 01:14:14.514]  They just want to silence people who point out that it's not.
[01:14:15.154 --> 01:14:17.237]  What else was happening in the UK this morning?
[01:14:17.498 --> 01:14:29.815]  They had a debate on one of the nation's top morning television shows about whether gingerbread biscuits, which you can't call them gingerbread men anymore by the way, that's politically incorrect, whether gingerbread biscuits
[01:14:30.396 --> 01:14:32.018]  Or politically correct enough.
[01:14:32.358 --> 01:14:38.344]  You know, maybe Gingerbread Biscuits is still a little bit dodgy when it comes to, you know, gender identification.
[01:14:38.744 --> 01:14:41.526]  Maybe Gingerbread Peoplekind is what they should be called.
[01:14:41.567 --> 01:14:45.150]  Or maybe Gingerbread Peoplekind Person is what they should be called.
[01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.790]  And anyway...
[01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:48.933]  Like, why are we assuming their gender?
[01:14:48.993 --> 01:14:50.834]  Surely that's even more offensive.
[01:14:51.255 --> 01:14:58.800]  And also what's even more offensive is the fact that these gingerbread people kind, person people kind things have four limbs.
[01:14:59.281 --> 01:15:00.542]  And maybe that's ableist.
[01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:02.803]  Maybe that will offend disabled people.
[01:15:03.304 --> 01:15:05.245]  And maybe we should just scrap them all together.
[01:15:05.265 --> 01:15:06.246]  But I'll finish on this.
[01:15:06.306 --> 01:15:13.451]  You expect the screeching, pearl-clutching, hysterical idiots on the left to get upset about mean words said by Boris Johnson.
[01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:16.673]  You wouldn't expect the Conservative Party to do it, would you?
[01:15:16.773 --> 01:15:17.534]  Well, yes, you would.
[01:15:17.674 --> 01:15:20.736]  Because they're gelded, they're castrated, they're pathetic.
[01:15:20.956 --> 01:15:23.517]  They have a leader with a 30% approval rating.
[01:15:23.757 --> 01:15:25.838]  They've made a complete arse of Brexit.
[01:15:26.139 --> 01:15:35.524]  And now they're more concerned about his mean words, being offended over Boris Johnson's mean words, than fulfilling the democratic mandate of the British people.
[01:15:35.804 --> 01:15:36.604]  And they wonder.
[01:15:37.205 --> 01:15:41.207]  They wonder why they're getting beaten in the polls by a complete clown.
[01:15:42.256 --> 01:15:44.897]  Fucking talk about focus on the real issues.
[01:15:45.177 --> 01:15:47.939]  You sell out turncoat pieces of shit.
[01:15:48.119 --> 01:15:48.979]  You're pathetic.
[01:15:49.359 --> 01:15:50.120]  Sort it out.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.581]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:53.701 --> 01:15:55.222]  Common sense is now illegal.
[01:15:55.282 --> 01:15:56.663]  This is the global takeover.
[01:15:56.683 --> 01:16:05.346]  Don't say mother or father, but let men lead women around on... And all these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[01:16:05.447 --> 01:16:06.127]  So I'm here
[01:16:08.933 --> 01:16:10.214]  Stop the hammering!
[01:16:10.675 --> 01:16:12.137]  Stop the hammering out there!
[01:16:12.177 --> 01:16:13.017]  Who's got a hammer?
[01:16:13.298 --> 01:16:13.798]  Where is it?
[01:16:14.159 --> 01:16:14.419]  Hammering!
[01:16:14.819 --> 01:16:15.180]  Hammering!
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:15.841]  Hammering!
[01:16:16.141 --> 01:16:16.501]  Hammering!
[01:16:16.922 --> 01:16:17.823]  Where's the hammer?
[01:16:18.644 --> 01:16:20.486]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor!
[01:16:20.586 --> 01:16:22.728]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering!
[01:16:22.928 --> 01:16:23.229]  Hammering!
[01:16:23.569 --> 01:16:23.909]  Hammering!
[01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:24.570]  Hammering!
[01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:25.251]  Hammering!
[01:16:25.571 --> 01:16:25.912]  Hammering!
[01:16:26.312 --> 01:16:27.934]  Stop the hammering!
[01:16:31.058 --> 01:16:32.379]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[01:16:32.399 --> 01:16:34.021]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[01:16:34.141 --> 01:16:35.642]  Stop the hammering!
[01:16:35.922 --> 01:16:36.923]  Hammering, hammering.
[01:16:37.744 --> 01:16:42.007]  And all these fools, and all these traitors don't get it.
[01:16:42.568 --> 01:16:48.973]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[01:16:49.554 --> 01:16:51.596]  It just f***ing sucks.
[01:16:51.936 --> 01:16:56.179]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:02.782]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control of everything.
[01:17:02.842 --> 01:17:03.203]  They're here.
[01:17:03.683 --> 01:17:06.584]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[01:17:06.644 --> 01:17:07.384]  That's what I know.
[01:17:08.045 --> 01:17:11.126]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:15.648]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it is choose your own adventure.
[01:17:15.928 --> 01:17:21.990]  At Infowarshore.com, standing with America, standing against the chi-coms in Hollywood, standing for victory and winning.
[01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:22.731]  Thanks to you.
[01:17:22.831 --> 01:17:23.291]  We'll be back.
[01:17:24.151 --> 01:17:27.232]  I'll go down to the g***** floor myself and stop it.
[01:17:27.272 --> 01:17:29.072]  Keep the g***** commercial break going.
[01:17:29.572 --> 01:17:33.253]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:17:33.393 --> 01:17:38.475]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[01:18:07.037 --> 01:18:10.559]  The man, the truth, the resistance, Alex Jones.
[01:18:10.599 --> 01:18:13.361]  I am a Hispanic Trump supporter slash InfoWarrior.
[01:18:13.381 --> 01:18:15.943]  I have a couple points to make, but I want to plug for you real quick.
[01:18:16.003 --> 01:18:19.025]  Survival Shield, Mason Iodine X2, life-changing.
[01:18:19.085 --> 01:18:20.967]  Supermail Vitality, life-changing.
[01:18:21.027 --> 01:18:22.668]  RainForce Plus, life-changing.
[01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:25.009]  Superblue non-fluoride toothpaste, life-changing.
[01:18:25.029 --> 01:18:26.510]  I'm sure the rest of them are good products.
[01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:28.492]  I haven't been able to try them all yet, but they're awesome.
[01:18:28.552 --> 01:18:30.213]  The hats, t-shirts, amazing.
[01:18:30.433 --> 01:18:32.255]  Briefly, tell us what the supplements did for you.
[01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:33.476]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:18:33.516 --> 01:18:35.258]  Just like you, I'm about the same body type.
[01:18:35.358 --> 01:18:37.019]  I'm short, stocky, strong guy.
[01:18:37.039 --> 01:18:38.821]  I'm Puerto Rican, Italian, and Cuban.
[01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:40.302]  Hispanic, strong supporter, like I said.
[01:18:40.402 --> 01:18:42.544]  And I started working out every day.
[01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.046]  I lift weights every day.
[01:18:44.206 --> 01:18:45.867]  I don't even have to take the day off.
[01:18:45.967 --> 01:18:48.830]  I'm taking the Survival Shield X to a drop of that every morning.
[01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:49.851]  I feel fantastic.
[01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:50.852]  My skin is clearing up.
[01:18:50.872 --> 01:18:51.512]  I have psoriasis.
[01:18:51.532 --> 01:18:52.553]  So that's clearing up.
[01:18:52.613 --> 01:18:53.714]  My hair is going back thicker.
[01:18:53.774 --> 01:18:56.877]  I'm losing some of it, but it's growing back thicker in the areas that I do have it.
[01:18:57.157 --> 01:18:59.079]  The brain force is just amazing.
[01:18:59.159 --> 01:19:00.400]  That stuff makes you think.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.681]  It keeps you on your toes.
[01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:02.922]  The same thing with the iodine.
[01:19:02.942 --> 01:19:05.264]  It just brings this clarity and this focus.
[01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:06.666]  And your products are amazing.
[01:19:06.786 --> 01:19:09.048]  It's like a cleansing for the brain when we listen to you.
[01:19:09.448 --> 01:19:11.230]  And it's just life-changing.
[01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:16.134]  And how people can go against the true resistance, they're going to learn soon that they're on the wrong side of history.
[01:19:16.174 --> 01:19:17.175]  And that's why we're the right.
[01:19:17.355 --> 01:19:18.876]  We're not the alt-right, we're just right.
[01:19:18.916 --> 01:19:22.499]  And I've got to say, I started Titans of Liberty's Truth Wars because of you, Alex.
[01:19:22.539 --> 01:19:24.080]  You are a big inspiration to me.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:24.781]  You're the real deal.
[01:19:25.081 --> 01:19:27.823]  If anybody's listening right now, Alex Jones is the real deal.
[01:19:33.527 --> 01:19:33.988]  Have you heard?
[01:19:34.468 --> 01:19:36.551]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[01:19:36.631 --> 01:19:37.913]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[01:19:38.093 --> 01:19:39.135]  They're all censoring us.
[01:19:39.515 --> 01:19:45.403]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[01:19:45.724 --> 01:19:48.728]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[01:20:03.557 --> 01:20:06.193]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:32.612 --> 01:20:40.057]  Alright, you know I cover a lot of things on this show.
[01:20:58.735 --> 01:21:02.197]  This broadcast on radio and TV and the internet that sounds crazy.
[01:21:05.179 --> 01:21:19.428]  I mean, I was talking about them putting estrogens in the food and water 20-something years ago because that was in Gerber documents, but 10 years ago it was in Smithsonian, Journal of Nature, Democracy Now, about it making most of the frogs hermaphroditic.
[01:21:20.228 --> 01:21:24.891]  So I talked about it and they attacked me and said, oh, you're crazy, and just made it into a big joke.
[01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:52.894]  It's the same thing when I remember like seven, eight years ago, reading where DARPA was testing the new high-tech light bulbs that they mandated, Obama did, that have little sensors in them, where then certain computers, even if you don't ask for it, have a chip that picks up a little transmission wavelength, it's like a garage door opener or a TV clicker, but more sophisticated,
[01:21:54.332 --> 01:21:57.895]  That sends orders to your computer to then have it do things.
[01:21:57.995 --> 01:22:05.622]  And then you learn about the communist Chinese had chips in the computers that were sending us with Trojan horses and we were sending them Trojan horses.
[01:22:06.824 --> 01:22:08.145]  But this is out of Gizmodo.
[01:22:08.165 --> 01:22:11.368]  There's another one out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:22:11.388 --> 01:22:13.730]  And I was just talking about this today.
[01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:14.731]  So I was going through one of the stacks.
[01:22:14.791 --> 01:22:15.632]  I had looked at a news.
[01:22:17.116 --> 01:22:24.718]  And it said, National Weather Service Facility Intercom, phone lines randomly overtaken by message in Chinese.
[01:22:28.379 --> 01:22:34.901]  That's going to be a big confidence builder for all the Chinese agents that are in our facilities, not just folks from China, when they try something big.
[01:22:35.561 --> 01:22:36.521]  But what was I just telling you?
[01:22:37.201 --> 01:22:39.162]  The telecommunications, the tech companies.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:48.027]  The national debt, Hollywood, all 50 private universities, even the Washington Post admits are run or partially run by Chinese intelligence.
[01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:49.289]  We are wide open.
[01:22:51.010 --> 01:22:56.276]  And that's why Feinstein and all them said, oh, Russia narrative, Russia narrative, because they know Trump knows about this.
[01:22:56.336 --> 01:22:58.137]  And we're trying to figure out what do we do?
[01:22:59.559 --> 01:23:01.441]  Put trade pressure on China and say, stop it?
[01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:05.900]  China's like, no, we're building artificial islands, we're gonna go to war with you.
[01:23:05.921 --> 01:23:07.602]  And we're like, okay, get ready.
[01:23:08.242 --> 01:23:11.324]  And the military's got their job very, very cut out for them.
[01:23:12.543 --> 01:23:16.064]  In every city, under infrastructure protection, the military's having to target and get ready.
[01:23:16.104 --> 01:23:21.907]  If things go red, they're going to have to... Each guy's probably got about 15 people he's got to take out in one day.
[01:23:21.927 --> 01:23:23.207]  I mean, it's a big job.
[01:23:24.068 --> 01:23:26.889]  I'm not telling the Chinese something they don't know.
[01:23:26.909 --> 01:23:29.870]  So they got the red teams ready in every town to wipe them out.
[01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:31.511]  The Chi-Coms are going to be ready, though.
[01:23:31.531 --> 01:23:33.291]  They're going to get a lot of our people if this goes red.
[01:23:34.452 --> 01:23:40.834]  So to all you stupid people in Silicon Valley and all the rest of you liberals, man, you guys are crazy.
[01:23:40.894 --> 01:23:41.695]  That's all I can tell you.
[01:23:43.132 --> 01:23:43.573]  You're nuts.
[01:23:45.294 --> 01:23:48.617]  And I've been talking to people where this has happened.
[01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:56.845]  I never went on air with it, but I have people at military bases told me six months ago that they'll pick the phones up, they'll be Chinese, and they'll put somebody on that knows what it's saying.
[01:23:56.885 --> 01:23:58.226]  It's like, America will fall.
[01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.187]  Your president is weak.
[01:23:59.487 --> 01:24:03.071]  We will defeat you as a PSYOP that they can, they've got control.
[01:24:06.294 --> 01:24:07.835]  Man, let me tell you something.
[01:24:08.692 --> 01:24:16.755]  If you're Tim Cook or you're Eric Schmidt or you're any of these people, do you think you're worth, do you think your ass is worth 10 cents when all this goes down?
[01:24:18.076 --> 01:24:20.877]  So, people ask, how you doing getting sued by Soros?
[01:24:21.417 --> 01:24:23.378]  How you doing getting called a traitor in the media?
[01:24:23.438 --> 01:24:23.978]  How you doing?
[01:24:23.998 --> 01:24:25.179]  I'm like, I'm doing great!
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.920]  The country ain't doing too good.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.221]  I chose this path.
[01:24:29.281 --> 01:24:30.121]  I'm trying to fight them.
[01:24:30.361 --> 01:24:31.722]  So I'm having an effect on them.
[01:24:31.782 --> 01:24:32.402]  I'm doing good.
[01:24:32.682 --> 01:24:34.443]  See, I chose to do this.
[01:24:36.789 --> 01:24:38.230]  Out of survival, not out of heroics.
[01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:40.871]  So I'm going to read this to you right now.
[01:24:40.891 --> 01:24:42.211]  This is out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:24:42.231 --> 01:24:42.912]  This is today.
[01:24:45.052 --> 01:24:51.655]  Employees at the National Weather Service in Maryland were startled when a random message blared over their intercom.
[01:24:54.016 --> 01:24:56.117]  See, it's not
[01:24:59.605 --> 01:25:06.247]  DARPA, or Space Command, or SAC, blaring, we've been attacked, missiles are incoming, get ready, get to shape.
[01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:10.429]  Then it's like, you Americans will pay, our president is weak.
[01:25:10.469 --> 01:25:11.329]  That's what's said over these.
[01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:12.710]  Everybody's like, what the?
[01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:16.991]  They're letting us know, hey, Trump gives us a problem.
[01:25:17.811 --> 01:25:18.552]  What'd they say yesterday?
[01:25:20.672 --> 01:25:21.533]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[01:25:23.113 --> 01:25:24.614]  Oh, what's going on here?
[01:25:24.634 --> 01:25:24.994]  No big deal.
[01:25:27.281 --> 01:25:29.542]  But see, we have Chinese engineers that come over here and get trained.
[01:25:29.562 --> 01:25:31.463]  They're sent here as kids, as college students.
[01:25:31.904 --> 01:25:32.424]  They get their 4.0.
[01:25:33.525 --> 01:25:37.507]  They get put in as engineers, and then their family is going to get killed in China.
[01:25:39.348 --> 01:25:41.109]  See, this has happened to us with two employees.
[01:25:43.451 --> 01:25:45.552]  And I've been asked not to talk about it, so I'm not going to name names.
[01:25:46.072 --> 01:25:52.196]  But in one case, one of our prominent people married a Chinese lady who spoke perfect English in college and everything.
[01:25:52.216 --> 01:25:55.758]  And then she starts saying, let's go to China and meet my family in the party.
[01:25:56.823 --> 01:26:01.067]  And then pretty soon it's, you can't really work with Alex Jones.
[01:26:01.107 --> 01:26:02.348]  You can't criticize China.
[01:26:03.409 --> 01:26:05.071]  You know, I got family trouble in China.
[01:26:05.111 --> 01:26:05.732]  That's how this works.
[01:26:06.212 --> 01:26:09.856]  And so everybody's wondering, oh, here we are at NOAA.
[01:26:09.876 --> 01:26:11.397]  That's a lot more than NOAA, obviously.
[01:26:11.437 --> 01:26:12.278]  It's the geospatial.
[01:26:12.858 --> 01:26:14.080]  It connects into a bunch of groups.
[01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:18.331]  And all of a sudden it's chiming in.
[01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:19.752]  We'll play some of the audio in a moment.
[01:26:20.292 --> 01:26:29.115]  Employees of the National Weather Service in Maryland were startled when a random message started blaring over the intercom in Chinese and then over the telephone lines.
[01:26:31.356 --> 01:26:39.919]  Kind of like Alexa and these other little house helpers do that get wired into everything, suddenly they're dialing people on your phone, they're telling you shut up, and it's all just a test.
[01:26:41.959 --> 01:26:43.660]  Because they found they get more engagement
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.381]  When they do stuff like that.
[01:26:48.401 --> 01:26:51.403]  So let's play part of this news report on that.
[01:26:51.443 --> 01:27:01.149]  But just in case you don't know who your bosses are, China said, Apple's run by us, we'll shut the factories down and launch economic and cyber war, Trump.
[01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:05.773]  And the next day, at federal offices all over the U.S.
[01:27:05.813 --> 01:27:08.755]  and the Caribbean and other areas, Chinese takes over.
[01:27:09.615 --> 01:27:10.476]  Here, here it is for yourself.
[01:27:12.705 --> 01:27:20.888]  Business Insider reports that federal officials are trying to figure out how a random Chinese language message suddenly blared over the intercom at a National Weather Service office in Maryland.
[01:27:21.529 --> 01:27:29.152]  Minutes before the voice of a Chinese woman was broadcast, employees received a similar message on their phones at the affiliate office in Colleague Park, Maryland.
[01:27:29.773 --> 01:27:34.195]  The intercom announcement caught employees off guard because the office loudspeakers are not used very often.
[01:27:34.835 --> 01:27:40.119]  The announcement, loosely translated to English, said, you have a package from Amazon at the Chinese Embassy.
[01:27:40.319 --> 01:27:41.440]  Press 1 for details.
[01:27:42.261 --> 01:27:48.185]  The agency's technical staff said it was in contact with AT&T to determine what exactly went wrong.
[01:27:48.826 --> 01:27:54.590]  Now, I know folks at the military bases, they get that Trump's going down, you're weak, you can't stop us, we're in control.
[01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:56.351]  Kind of like the Outer Limits intro.
[01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.553]  Can we come up with an Outer Limits intro off YouTube?
[01:27:59.614 --> 01:28:01.896]  We are in control of your television.
[01:28:01.936 --> 01:28:03.637]  We control the vertical and the horizontal.
[01:28:04.636 --> 01:28:05.256]  That's what it is.
[01:28:06.357 --> 01:28:07.198]  Just like in war.
[01:28:07.598 --> 01:28:09.079]  Broadcasting over the picket line.
[01:28:09.119 --> 01:28:09.940]  We are in control.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:10.981]  Your generals are weak.
[01:28:11.441 --> 01:28:12.702]  Your wives will never see you.
[01:28:12.722 --> 01:28:13.723]  You're going to die.
[01:28:14.484 --> 01:28:19.588]  Now, Tim Cook says we're looking to take Jones completely off and get rid of his number one amp.
[01:28:19.928 --> 01:28:22.370]  You can't be number one, you dirty Americans!
[01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.711]  We run the slave factories.
[01:28:24.011 --> 01:28:24.711]  Hoorah!
[01:28:25.492 --> 01:28:26.653]  Americans are too weak.
[01:28:26.913 --> 01:28:28.815]  They're going to accept us taking control.
[01:28:29.858 --> 01:28:30.418]  That's what they think.
[01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.440]  I'm going to give the number out to take your phone calls.
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:33.300]  We've got a ton of news.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.461]  I haven't hit yet.
[01:28:35.882 --> 01:28:38.463]  I've got a stack of Islamic attacks on people in Europe.
[01:28:38.784 --> 01:28:41.145]  Dog defends German couple from violent migrants.
[01:28:41.685 --> 01:28:43.287]  But under Islam, you're not allowed to have dogs.
[01:28:43.307 --> 01:28:45.888]  So Europe's talking about not allowing folks to have dogs.
[01:28:46.108 --> 01:28:50.551]  And, well, now they're starting Islamic-only swimming clubs, everything.
[01:28:50.571 --> 01:28:54.974]  And the pools have to be closed when they're there, because they're first-class citizens and you're not.
[01:28:55.434 --> 01:28:56.195]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:56.215 --> 01:28:56.535]  Stick with us.
[01:28:59.502 --> 01:28:59.742]  Hunter.
[01:29:23.417 --> 01:29:25.638]  Martin Luther King level, I have a dream stuff.
[01:29:25.658 --> 01:29:27.579]  I mean, I just know destiny when I hear it.
[01:29:27.699 --> 01:29:30.620]  I think you should tell people your millennium level idea.
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:36.083]  I mean, it's like one of those ideas that you only hear a few times in a lifetime and usually people ignore it.
[01:29:36.183 --> 01:29:36.883]  This is history.
[01:29:37.304 --> 01:29:40.065]  So please tell folks the idea you came up with.
[01:29:40.345 --> 01:29:41.186]  Yeah, you got it, Alex.
[01:29:41.286 --> 01:29:47.051]  You know, a lot of what's coming out of the left right now is this narrative that my campaign is Russian bots, which is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:29:47.191 --> 01:29:49.814]  Of course, we have real people giving testimonials for the WalkAway campaign.
[01:29:50.294 --> 01:29:59.883]  But it sort of sparked an idea in my mind, since there's going to be a lot of naysayers out there who are going to try to dismiss this campaign and what's happening with WalkAway as bots and as not real.
[01:30:00.003 --> 01:30:02.165]  I thought to myself, you know, what we really need to do
[01:30:02.825 --> 01:30:02.925]  Yes.
[01:30:19.223 --> 01:30:22.285]  And listen, if you're not walking away from the Democrat Party, that's fine.
[01:30:22.305 --> 01:30:26.488]  But I think that at this point, people should at least be willing to say, I'm walking away from the hatefulness.
[01:30:26.748 --> 01:30:28.389]  I'm walking away from the divisiveness.
[01:30:28.649 --> 01:30:32.532]  I'm walking away from the violent rhetoric and the division.
[01:30:33.532 --> 01:30:34.773]  So this is what I want to do.
[01:30:35.033 --> 01:30:43.699]  I want to, in the fall, have an amazing demonstration organization nationwide where we do a nationwide march on Washington.
[01:30:43.779 --> 01:30:48.282]  I want it to be the biggest, most incredible and most powerful march this nation has ever seen.
[01:30:48.462 --> 01:30:49.662]  You need to be flooded, folks.
[01:30:49.702 --> 01:30:52.464]  And believe me, I know at a gut level what's going to work and what's not.
[01:30:52.524 --> 01:30:56.245]  So if people fund this, I couldn't see a better place for people to do it.
[01:30:56.285 --> 01:31:00.207]  So I'm pledging $10,000 that we'll donate right after the show to the account.
[01:31:00.227 --> 01:31:00.827]  I want it online.
[01:31:00.847 --> 01:31:02.327]  I want people to see that happen.
[01:31:02.608 --> 01:31:03.748]  So please make sure that happens.
[01:31:03.848 --> 01:31:05.529]  Well, there are two ways that people can donate.
[01:31:05.929 --> 01:31:09.412]  I've set up a GoFundMe and I've set up a Patreon account.
[01:31:09.572 --> 01:31:15.776]  Both of these things are accessible if they go to walkawaycampaign.com and click on sponsorship.
[01:31:16.316 --> 01:31:20.819]  The GoFundMe is great if you're somebody who's just able to make a one-time donation of any amount.
[01:31:20.859 --> 01:31:22.400]  We appreciate anything that you can do.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.321]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:31:23.521 --> 01:31:24.541]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:25.422 --> 01:31:31.206]  I had a feeling that you would be somebody who would be very enthusiastic about this and I feel exactly the same way you do.
[01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:41.651]  It was my idea, but I also thought to myself, this is something that really, possibly, not only has the potential to do a lot of healing, but possibly even preventing a civil war.
[01:31:41.991 --> 01:31:43.351]  And you're just saying, just walk away.
[01:31:43.632 --> 01:31:44.512]  Like, it means don't fight.
[01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.913]  It means, just, just don't be under this cult control.
[01:31:47.093 --> 01:31:48.894]  Oh, this is divinely inspired.
[01:31:48.954 --> 01:31:53.776]  I'm telling, I know the zeitgeist when I'm close to it, and I am now in the center of it.
[01:31:54.137 --> 01:31:54.757]  Oh, ooh.
[01:32:00.242 --> 01:32:00.682]  Look at that.
[01:32:00.702 --> 01:32:03.445]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[01:32:03.465 --> 01:32:05.687]  That's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[01:32:06.067 --> 01:32:06.848]  We didn't do that.
[01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:12.612]  You think I would metaphysically sell you something that is the very best I can get?
[01:32:13.013 --> 01:32:14.654]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:32:15.255 --> 01:32:23.802]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:32:24.282 --> 01:32:25.984]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:32:26.004 --> 01:32:27.125]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:32:27.785 --> 01:32:30.248]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:32:30.268 --> 01:32:31.449]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:35.193]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:32:37.976 --> 01:32:42.561]  Liquid consciousness.
[01:32:42.641 --> 01:32:43.101]  Look it up.
[01:32:44.202 --> 01:32:44.663]  Find out.
[01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:47.992]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:16.081 --> 01:33:17.623]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.743 --> 01:33:21.906]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:22.027 --> 01:33:23.528]  For your mind.
[01:33:29.954 --> 01:33:32.096]  There is nothing wrong with your television set.
[01:33:33.177 --> 01:33:34.838]  Do not attempt to adjust the picture.
[01:33:35.019 --> 01:33:35.499]  China!
[01:33:36.019 --> 01:33:37.621]  We are controlling transmission.
[01:33:37.681 --> 01:33:38.141]  China!
[01:33:39.082 --> 01:33:41.585]  If we wish to make it louder, we will bring up the volume.
[01:33:42.335 --> 01:33:42.595]  Pro Hillary!
[01:33:42.615 --> 01:33:42.855]  Pro Hillary!
[01:33:42.915 --> 01:33:43.276]  Pro Hillary!
[01:33:43.296 --> 01:33:46.397]  If we want to make it softer, we will tune it to a whisper.
[01:33:47.058 --> 01:33:47.678]  Alex is bad.
[01:33:47.778 --> 01:33:48.099]  Alex is bad.
[01:33:48.119 --> 01:33:49.639]  We will control the horizontal.
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.941]  We will control the vertical.
[01:33:53.202 --> 01:33:54.382]  We can roll the image.
[01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:56.143]  Make it flutter.
[01:33:57.964 --> 01:33:59.926]  We can change the focus to a soft blur.
[01:34:01.487 --> 01:34:03.088]  Or sharpen it to crystal clarity.
[01:34:03.668 --> 01:34:07.890]  For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.
[01:34:08.511 --> 01:34:11.733]  We repeat, there is nothing wrong with your television set.
[01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:15.409]  You are about to participate in a great adventure.
[01:34:16.369 --> 01:34:26.331]  You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the outer limits.
[01:34:28.971 --> 01:34:30.832]  We are in control of your children.
[01:34:30.932 --> 01:34:33.572]  The average adult spends 10 hours in front of a screen.
[01:34:33.612 --> 01:34:35.173]  The average child 12 hours.
[01:34:36.333 --> 01:34:37.513]  We are in control.
[01:34:37.973 --> 01:34:41.934]  We are breaking in at the National Weather Service with Chinese government messages of your submission.
[01:34:42.984 --> 01:34:43.865]  We are in control.
[01:34:43.905 --> 01:34:46.667]  We are in control of your debt, your Hollywood, your people.
[01:34:46.787 --> 01:34:50.931]  Maoism has been taught at all your universities, cared by our operatives.
[01:34:51.511 --> 01:34:54.854]  We have been selling you out for three decades, working with traitors within your government.
[01:34:55.655 --> 01:35:03.561]  Now, Tim Cook is preparing to ban Alex Jones off all Apple platforms, with good collaborators working hard to have it shut down.
[01:35:04.142 --> 01:35:04.843]  And they're proud of it.
[01:35:04.883 --> 01:35:07.044]  They think they're on the winning team.
[01:35:07.765 --> 01:35:16.709]  I think it's part of this great merger with the world and great peace to settle the dissonance organs, to kill the Christians, to kill the Buddhists, to put the burkas on the women.
[01:35:16.749 --> 01:35:24.312]  It's all about power, all about raw power by little pathetic followers at the New York Times and BuzzFeed.
[01:35:24.392 --> 01:35:28.995]  Horrible little twisted people from twisted families and twisted backgrounds.
[01:35:30.135 --> 01:35:34.197]  But if they could overthrow America, they could be a real boy.
[01:35:36.345 --> 01:35:37.606]  They could be somebody.
[01:35:39.587 --> 01:35:44.570]  They could be able to take action.
[01:35:47.171 --> 01:35:50.333]  Now, I want to give the number out.
[01:35:50.353 --> 01:35:59.559]  Let's talk about the unprecedented massive deplatforming plan that is complete against us.
[01:36:00.735 --> 01:36:05.958]  And that is attempted to set the precedent what you think Congress should do and why haven't there been hearings?
[01:36:07.099 --> 01:36:08.860]  Why are the Republicans flat-footed on this?
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:12.822]  Trump just said one thing to Jack Dorsey about the shadow banning is illegal.
[01:36:13.182 --> 01:36:14.023]  We're looking into it.
[01:36:15.003 --> 01:36:21.427]  And Dorsey's on Hannity saying he loves Trump now and oh we're not shadow banning we're your friends don't run.
[01:36:21.447 --> 01:36:25.369]  Hi, I'm Jack Dorsey.
[01:36:27.833 --> 01:36:28.695]  So now that's going on.
[01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:33.348]  I mean, doesn't that tell Congress stop acting like a bunch of weak-kneed buffoons?
[01:36:34.986 --> 01:36:39.928]  And stand up for the country and stand up against Tim Cook and say, this apple's the worst.
[01:36:40.508 --> 01:36:41.848]  Why did you move to China?
[01:36:42.789 --> 01:36:45.870]  Why you let them state-run have the keys to the iCloud everywhere?
[01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:49.051]  Again, they hate me because I just keep ringing the alarm.
[01:36:49.171 --> 01:36:54.693]  Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency.
[01:36:56.814 --> 01:36:58.254]  Emergency, emergency.
[01:36:58.794 --> 01:36:59.955]  Can't really do it good with my voice.
[01:37:00.135 --> 01:37:02.836]  Somebody found the Star Trek, like, you know, alarm sound.
[01:37:06.486 --> 01:37:08.048]  These people killed over 100 million.
[01:37:08.388 --> 01:37:11.671]  These people kill innocent Buddhists and Christians for no reason in Southern Oregon.
[01:37:11.951 --> 01:37:12.792]  They're really bad.
[01:37:13.333 --> 01:37:17.877]  And Jack Dorsey's like, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, because it's all a distraction.
[01:37:18.257 --> 01:37:22.041]  Tim Cook's like, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.
[01:37:24.403 --> 01:37:26.465]  America had slaves, America had slaves.
[01:37:26.505 --> 01:37:28.767]  Meanwhile, China has hundreds of millions of slaves.
[01:37:30.256 --> 01:37:34.519]  A two-party system with a dictatorship sworn to defeat America.
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:37.882]  And I don't want to be enemies with Jack Dorsey or Tim Cook.
[01:37:38.262 --> 01:37:39.823]  They are fundamental enemies.
[01:37:39.843 --> 01:37:44.287]  In the case of Tim Cook, I mean, he's... I've said Apple and Google are the worst.
[01:37:45.467 --> 01:37:48.109]  Twitter is a little side thing, very popular, whatever.
[01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:51.452]  But it's been one of the most energetic censors.
[01:37:52.793 --> 01:37:55.275]  And then you've got Facebook playing along, but it's been bad.
[01:37:57.981 --> 01:38:02.363]  The Democrats are openly election meddling, blocking most of Congress.
[01:38:03.303 --> 01:38:05.004]  Congress only noticed when they got dialed back 99%.
[01:38:05.504 --> 01:38:10.186]  When they got blocked, when they got muzzled.
[01:38:11.546 --> 01:38:19.410]  Because you can say, well you can still talk and put a muzzle over your face, but... Pretty soon they just totally shut you down.
[01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:23.031]  Now go ahead, play it.
[01:38:27.637 --> 01:38:29.439]  I mean, that's what's going on here.
[01:38:29.459 --> 01:38:35.743]  And we've got Chinese... ...coming over like, your country is ours!
[01:38:38.745 --> 01:38:44.049]  The poor Chinese are the slaves of this thing, and I'm like... I'm going... Apple announced it's moving to China.
[01:38:44.249 --> 01:38:45.329]  They have all the documents.
[01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:46.930]  Google's already censoring here.
[01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:48.892]  They're working with the Chai comms, that's dangerous.
[01:38:49.372 --> 01:38:52.054]  Oh my god, they actually have Chinese agents running the major universities.
[01:38:52.354 --> 01:38:54.996]  They've used them as the outside intelligence operation to take over.
[01:38:57.671 --> 01:38:58.512]  I'm just telling everybody.
[01:39:04.137 --> 01:39:05.878]  I mean, we've already been banned on almost everything.
[01:39:09.201 --> 01:39:12.484]  But all because Trump said one thing to Jack Dorsey.
[01:39:13.965 --> 01:39:15.607]  He's like talking to Hannity in off-air.
[01:39:15.627 --> 01:39:16.507]  Can I talk to the president?
[01:39:16.607 --> 01:39:17.348]  I don't want to ban anybody.
[01:39:17.909 --> 01:39:19.610]  Actually, I'm kind of like Trump a little bit, you know.
[01:39:26.755 --> 01:39:31.237]  Because what they're doing is so outrageous that if we ever woke up to it, they'd never get away with it.
[01:39:31.517 --> 01:39:32.458]  But I will tell you this.
[01:39:34.098 --> 01:39:42.142]  I'm happy for Amnesty, for Tim Cook, and Jack Dorsey, and Bezos, and all the rest of the little merry band, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:39:43.075 --> 01:39:59.345]  If you'll just let the country be its own, have some free speech, don't totally merge with the Communist Chinese, and decide that you weren't like baby ducks imprinting on America hating, and Christian hating, and God hating, and Western hating, because it's not a state-as-command-and-control system.
[01:40:00.826 --> 01:40:08.351]  If you just back off now, kind of like Hitler's high command, we're bad guys, but about a year before they lost the war, they went, we've already lost it.
[01:40:08.451 --> 01:40:09.712]  Let's get off this path.
[01:40:09.752 --> 01:40:11.493]  They came to Hitler and they said, let's sue for peace.
[01:40:12.708 --> 01:40:13.769]  We'll be able to keep Germany.
[01:40:14.289 --> 01:40:15.770]  We won't kill another 10 million Germans.
[01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:17.371]  Because 10 million already died.
[01:40:17.391 --> 01:40:19.232]  22 million died total.
[01:40:19.912 --> 01:40:23.134]  And Hitler said, you little cowards, we are going all the way.
[01:40:23.634 --> 01:40:26.856]  I'm just saying, you might want to sue for peace.
[01:40:26.876 --> 01:40:31.499]  And I know you're not going to listen now.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.961]  But you're going to listen later.
[01:40:37.402 --> 01:40:39.884]  Now, I have not covered this yet.
[01:40:40.731 --> 01:40:44.713]  And I've had friends of mine and people that work in the government texting me asking me why not, because it is a big story.
[01:40:44.773 --> 01:40:46.394]  And I mean, it's incredible.
[01:40:46.414 --> 01:40:47.175]  It broke last night.
[01:40:47.695 --> 01:40:51.597]  You just heard man was training a dozen kids for mass shootings.
[01:40:52.378 --> 01:40:54.379]  And then the media put out the idea, you know, right wingers.
[01:40:55.039 --> 01:40:58.281]  But then when you actually read the article, it's up on Infowars.com.
[01:40:59.122 --> 01:41:02.844]  Children were brought to New Mexico compound for weapons training, officials said.
[01:41:02.904 --> 01:41:03.144]  Yes.
[01:41:05.206 --> 01:41:09.128]  Kids found in filthy compound were allegedly being trained to be school shooters.
[01:41:11.459 --> 01:41:13.220]  But you never find out it was Islamic.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:17.322]  So, we're gonna be covering that.
[01:41:17.742 --> 01:41:29.047]  And like I said, they got a bunch of these places prepared and ready for right when school starts and right into the midterms, it's gonna be school, shooting, fish in a barrel, and I wish it wouldn't happen.
[01:41:29.387 --> 01:41:38.391]  And they don't want me on our viral platforms everywhere so that we can just question what's happening when it unfolds.
[01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:39.211]  But,
[01:41:41.471 --> 01:41:54.902]  As I've been saying the last few months, every day, every hour when I'm on air, they're planning a giant Islamic rollout, an Antifa rollout, a Maoist rollout of a fall of rage to destabilize things enough.
[01:41:55.743 --> 01:41:59.486]  And then it won't matter if people are screaming, Allah Akbar, gun everybody down.
[01:41:59.506 --> 01:42:00.967]  They've already practiced the media covering that up.
[01:42:01.367 --> 01:42:03.529]  I won't be on the main internet.
[01:42:03.549 --> 01:42:04.190]  I'll be on the radio.
[01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:10.152]  But we'll have Infowars.com censored videos and feeds every day, and we'll cut it up in live time.
[01:42:10.172 --> 01:42:14.713]  It's gonna start by tomorrow, where the show will be cut up as it goes, and it's free to air.
[01:42:14.973 --> 01:42:15.473]  Here's a piece.
[01:42:15.733 --> 01:42:16.173]  Here's a piece.
[01:42:16.193 --> 01:42:19.734]  Here's audio, here's video, free to air for all of you to put out however you wish.
[01:42:20.215 --> 01:42:24.476]  They're gonna try to de-platform my voice and my face itself, but that'll be a little bit different ball of wax.
[01:42:25.416 --> 01:42:26.157]  It's totally illegal.
[01:42:26.737 --> 01:42:28.638]  But we're going to get the transmission out.
[01:42:28.658 --> 01:42:29.799]  We've been ready for this for a while.
[01:42:30.219 --> 01:42:32.281]  I told everybody last week, I said, they're about to totally ban us.
[01:42:32.301 --> 01:42:33.741]  They said, oh, they'll never do that, Alex.
[01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:34.742]  Oh, yeah, it'll be next week.
[01:42:34.762 --> 01:42:36.103]  So here we are next week.
[01:42:36.143 --> 01:42:36.423]  It's here.
[01:42:36.823 --> 01:42:38.204]  So we figured out their plan.
[01:42:39.065 --> 01:42:42.247]  But they've got these command bases with cut out mental patients everywhere.
[01:42:42.267 --> 01:42:45.509]  They can find them by the very folks that did the World Trade Center attack in 92.
[01:42:47.530 --> 01:42:50.292]  And they are preparing their big Islamic attack.
[01:42:50.452 --> 01:42:54.695]  All leftist forces are preparing to launch their attack in the next few months along with the left.
[01:42:54.715 --> 01:42:55.296]  So get ready.
[01:42:55.596 --> 01:42:58.958]  That's why they're cutting all conservatives off so we can't respond when they launch their attacks.
[01:42:59.378 --> 01:43:05.423]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:05.763 --> 01:43:08.365]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[01:43:08.965 --> 01:43:12.407]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:12.667 --> 01:43:14.749]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years.
[01:43:14.949 --> 01:43:16.909]  And is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:17.349 --> 01:43:20.630]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:31.752]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:32.512 --> 01:43:37.113]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients.
[01:43:37.553 --> 01:43:41.054]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[01:43:42.694 --> 01:43:51.218]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:43:59.304 --> 01:44:02.507]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:44:02.968 --> 01:44:04.269]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:44:04.749 --> 01:44:16.300]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:22.086]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:44:22.466 --> 01:44:25.888]  Experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:44:26.288 --> 01:44:32.131]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:44:32.371 --> 01:44:37.014]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:44:37.534 --> 01:44:39.835]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:44:40.175 --> 01:44:41.516]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:44:41.916 --> 01:44:46.799]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:44:47.039 --> 01:44:51.522]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:44:51.622 --> 01:44:53.763]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:44:54.303 --> 01:44:59.206]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:45:00.207 --> 01:45:04.910]  And all these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:08.852]  So I'm here hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering.
[01:45:08.872 --> 01:45:09.733]  Stop the hammering!
[01:45:10.193 --> 01:45:11.674]  Stop the hammering out there!
[01:45:11.714 --> 01:45:12.554]  Who's got a hammer?
[01:45:12.835 --> 01:45:13.335]  Where is it?
[01:45:16.448 --> 01:45:17.329]  Where's the hammer?
[01:45:18.150 --> 01:45:19.972]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor!
[01:45:20.092 --> 01:45:22.214]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering!
[01:45:22.414 --> 01:45:22.814]  Hammering.
[01:45:23.075 --> 01:45:23.455]  Hammering.
[01:45:23.735 --> 01:45:24.136]  Hammering.
[01:45:24.396 --> 01:45:24.816]  Hammering.
[01:45:25.057 --> 01:45:25.457]  Hammering.
[01:45:25.817 --> 01:45:27.459]  Stop the hammering!
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:28.360]  Hammering.
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.041]  Hammering.
[01:45:29.301 --> 01:45:29.701]  Hammering.
[01:45:29.982 --> 01:45:30.442]  Hammering.
[01:45:30.582 --> 01:45:31.843]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin!
[01:45:31.863 --> 01:45:33.545]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call!
[01:45:33.685 --> 01:45:35.167]  Stop the hammering!
[01:45:35.467 --> 01:45:35.867]  Hammering.
[01:45:36.108 --> 01:45:36.448]  Hammering.
[01:45:37.269 --> 01:45:38.150]  And all these fools...
[01:45:39.318 --> 01:45:41.519]  And all these traders don't get it.
[01:45:42.079 --> 01:45:48.482]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[01:45:49.062 --> 01:45:51.103]  It just f***ing sucks.
[01:45:51.443 --> 01:45:55.685]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[01:45:56.385 --> 01:46:02.307]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control of everything.
[01:46:02.347 --> 01:46:02.727]  They're here.
[01:46:03.207 --> 01:46:06.108]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[01:46:06.168 --> 01:46:06.908]  That's what I know.
[01:46:07.568 --> 01:46:10.649]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[01:46:11.029 --> 01:46:15.171]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it is choose your own adventure.
[01:46:15.431 --> 01:46:21.512]  At Infowarshore.com, standing with America, standing against the chi-coms in Hollywood, standing for victory and winning.
[01:46:21.692 --> 01:46:22.233]  Thanks to you.
[01:46:22.333 --> 01:46:22.813]  We'll be back.
[01:46:23.673 --> 01:46:26.755]  I'll go down to the g***** floor myself and stop it.
[01:46:26.795 --> 01:46:28.576]  Keep the g***** commercial break going.
[01:46:29.076 --> 01:46:32.778]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:46:32.938 --> 01:46:38.001]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[01:46:50.267 --> 01:46:54.369]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.

[01:47:03.013 --> 01:47:05.655]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.877 --> 01:47:32.638]  Here's the story.
[01:47:32.758 --> 01:47:33.919]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:47:33.959 --> 01:47:35.460]  I hadn't even gotten to her to even play.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.221]  Colbert attacked me a few nights ago.
[01:47:37.821 --> 01:47:44.446]  He said I'm in the KKK and his proof was a can of Gatorade or a bottle of Gatorade with white syrup in it.
[01:47:45.687 --> 01:47:48.509]  And he dumps it on his head and says that I'm in the KKK.
[01:47:48.569 --> 01:47:49.450]  And it wasn't even funny.
[01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:52.032]  Some of the stuff he does is funny.
[01:47:52.052 --> 01:47:53.593]  Me and my wife were watching it online.
[01:47:53.653 --> 01:47:55.794]  We're like... But there it is.
[01:47:55.874 --> 01:47:56.335]  Colbert.
[01:47:56.895 --> 01:47:59.077]  Alex Jones banned for promoting race war.
[01:48:00.882 --> 01:48:03.403]  When it's in the WikiLeaks that it's the left doing it.
[01:48:03.443 --> 01:48:06.524]  Yeah, first he poured honey on his head, then the bees come to get him.
[01:48:06.905 --> 01:48:10.686]  Which I mean is a metaphor of everybody coming to swarm me and take me down.
[01:48:10.706 --> 01:48:12.727]  They think I'm too dumb to not get those metaphors.
[01:48:13.627 --> 01:48:14.328]  Those allegories.
[01:48:15.348 --> 01:48:21.391]  Latest, leftist, late-night, comic-built straw man to misrepresent Infowars.
[01:48:21.411 --> 01:48:22.951]  They go, oh, but it's just comedy.
[01:48:23.632 --> 01:48:25.872]  Yeah, celebrating us being taken off all these platforms.
[01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:29.154]  It's just funny that, you know, they're taking you off air.
[01:48:31.365 --> 01:48:32.965]  That'll teach everybody else a lesson.
[01:48:35.206 --> 01:48:39.547]  You better submit to all this, or you'll get taken off the air too.
[01:48:39.708 --> 01:48:41.928]  What an un-American message.
[01:48:41.948 --> 01:48:43.949]  Like we're a bunch of cowards.
[01:48:44.989 --> 01:48:45.949]  Like we're a bunch of idiots.
[01:48:46.009 --> 01:48:47.810]  Now let me get to this report, because I mentioned it.
[01:48:50.251 --> 01:49:00.394]  We've known that in the case of the shooter in Parkland, and in the case of Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook and other places,
[01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:02.711]  They get their guns illegally.
[01:49:02.831 --> 01:49:03.751]  They're being protected.
[01:49:04.032 --> 01:49:05.553]  They're always on a Prozac-type drug.
[01:49:05.573 --> 01:49:08.494]  They're always wearing black French coats and into devil worship.
[01:49:08.795 --> 01:49:10.576]  They have communist pins and Nazi pins.
[01:49:10.916 --> 01:49:11.977]  Just into being bad.
[01:49:13.698 --> 01:49:16.099]  And most of them have identified as incels.
[01:49:16.139 --> 01:49:18.261]  Involuntarily celibate.
[01:49:18.521 --> 01:49:19.661]  So they also have a hang-up.
[01:49:20.122 --> 01:49:21.603]  They're usually kind of Aschbergers-ish.
[01:49:21.643 --> 01:49:23.504]  They only play on iPhones and video games.
[01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:25.685]  So they're really upset about the outside world.
[01:49:26.646 --> 01:49:28.207]  They biologically feel rejected.
[01:49:30.011 --> 01:49:30.952]  So they go out and do this.
[01:49:31.052 --> 01:49:33.855]  Now that's what I really said about those shootings, not what the media said.
[01:49:33.875 --> 01:49:34.496]  See how it's different?
[01:49:35.697 --> 01:49:36.417]  Or what they edited.
[01:49:37.919 --> 01:49:46.728]  And there's also a phenomenon with Islamicist training in facilities all over the country that we've talked about, Islamic training centers.
[01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:49.631]  And the media always says that's a hoax.
[01:49:52.079 --> 01:49:57.024]  The corporate media is like they said Trump winning was a hoax, but there's constantly bust going on quietly.
[01:49:57.484 --> 01:50:01.589]  Well, this latest bust is tied into the 1992-93 World Trade Center bombing.
[01:50:04.378 --> 01:50:05.279]  People are all married.
[01:50:06.179 --> 01:50:08.301]  Ian, he's married to the daughters of the main imam.
[01:50:10.042 --> 01:50:14.225]  And the MO of the Islamists is, almost 100% are on welfare.
[01:50:14.285 --> 01:50:14.885]  They don't work.
[01:50:15.245 --> 01:50:18.227]  They wear these nightgown outfits as the males.
[01:50:19.148 --> 01:50:20.669]  Little nightgown with little hats.
[01:50:21.469 --> 01:50:23.131]  And they just talk about how powerful they are.
[01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:24.391]  They usually live in some cesspit.
[01:50:24.411 --> 01:50:27.914]  And then they trick women to come live with them with their babies.
[01:50:29.842 --> 01:50:43.252]  And it's just a fetid hellhole, but then the young boys are all trained for jihad, and the police got reports from neighbors, they went in, and sure enough, a man arrested as extremist Muslim, New Mexico compound, was training kids to commit school shootings.
[01:50:44.293 --> 01:50:45.154]  Right on time.
[01:50:45.174 --> 01:50:48.136]  Because that's how you get the guns of the average American.
[01:50:49.397 --> 01:50:57.424]  The father of a missing three-year-old who was arrested in a Mexico compound linked to extremist Muslims last week was training children to commit school shootings, court documents following Wednesday revealed.
[01:50:57.944 --> 01:51:09.935]  Prosecutors said Siraj Aban Wahaja, 39, was conducting weapons training on the compound where 11 children were found hungry and living in squalor, just like the other Islamic countries.
[01:51:10.715 --> 01:51:16.761]  They asked Wahaja, who appeared in the court on Wednesday, to be held without bail.
[01:51:17.864 --> 01:51:29.935]  Prosecutors allege in court documents filed Wednesday that Sirjabhan Wajah, we ought to get that FBI agent on we had on last week arguing about this, 39, was training children to commit school shootings.
[01:51:31.396 --> 01:51:43.247]  Wajah is the son of Brooklyn Emam who named, Wajah, who was named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in a 93 World Trade Center bombing in the New York Post reported.
[01:51:44.653 --> 01:51:46.574]  And then just look at these poor ladies that were out there.
[01:51:46.594 --> 01:51:47.554]  Keep scrolling down, please.
[01:51:48.175 --> 01:51:58.699]  Authorities raided the compound on Friday after months-long search investigating the disappearance of a boy with severe mental issues who went missing from Georgia in December.
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.160]  Dad arrested as extremist.
[01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:05.823]  Domestic compound planned exorcism tied to terror-linked imam reports say.
[01:52:06.083 --> 01:52:08.804]  They also had a dead body of another kid they lured to the compound.
[01:52:12.951 --> 01:52:14.192]  Overall, a nightmarish facility.
[01:52:14.932 --> 01:52:17.433]  On Monday, a child's remains were found on the property by authorities.
[01:52:17.814 --> 01:52:21.575]  We're working on a positive identification, but did not confirm the remains were that of the missing boy.
[01:52:22.116 --> 01:52:37.043]  Lucas Morton J. LaVille, 35, Harjara Wahaja, and Subhana Wahaja, 35, were also arrested on the property on Friday after all faced child abuse charges.
[01:52:38.866 --> 01:52:40.107]  You got these, these ladies.
[01:52:42.849 --> 01:52:51.855]  From the left, I'm not going to go over their names, the makeshift compound located in the Colorado border was found, filled with old tires, wooden pallets, and other debris.
[01:52:51.955 --> 01:52:59.060]  Upon authority's arrival, Bahaja was heavily armed with AR-15s, and it goes into the documents they were planning mass shootings and Islamic uprising.
[01:53:00.578 --> 01:53:25.798]  And what it is, is they get people out of prison, they hype them up, and they trick the women out there, and then they live in this paranoid thing for years, that the end of the world's coming, and they're trying to kill, you know, the infidels, and then it never comes, and they're just taking the welfare checks out there, and then people get too lazy to even drive into town and get the welfare checks, and then somebody called from the compound, and their neighbors have been calling for years, but they go, well, they're Muslims, we're not touching them.
[01:53:25.818 --> 01:53:26.539]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:53:27.452 --> 01:53:30.133]  And so they finally went out there and the well was broken.
[01:53:31.093 --> 01:53:33.514]  They had wind traps out trying to get dew out of the air.
[01:53:33.534 --> 01:53:37.756]  A whole bunch of people and they couldn't take care of themselves.
[01:53:38.516 --> 01:53:42.238]  They could just train to kill people at schools, reportedly.
[01:53:43.358 --> 01:53:46.019]  And that's the whacked out nature of radical Islam.
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:52.061]  They won't take one refugee from all the Syria wars Saudi Arabia started.
[01:53:52.542 --> 01:53:54.102]  They tell us to take them and Europe to take them.
[01:53:54.522 --> 01:53:55.663]  But they've got trillions of dollars.
[01:53:56.837 --> 01:54:00.559]  That our media lectures us how we're bad, because we haven't taken enough.
[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:05.042]  Those stories are up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but here is what we know.
[01:54:06.883 --> 01:54:14.608]  The Marxists, the Maoists, the Globalists, the Antifa, the Leftists, the Islamicists, they are making their full push this fall.
[01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:16.029]  End of summer, fall.
[01:54:16.089 --> 01:54:16.429]  Right now.
[01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:21.993]  And law enforcement can't wait when they've got tips on things like this.
[01:54:22.053 --> 01:54:23.714]  They've got to move in.
[01:54:24.494 --> 01:54:24.875]  Because
[01:54:26.252 --> 01:54:28.694]  You've got these people and their doomsday cult scenarios.
[01:54:29.175 --> 01:54:34.139]  They're not just going to sit there and drink a bunch of vodka and barbiturates like the Hale-Bopp loons.
[01:54:34.179 --> 01:54:37.062]  Maybe one out of a hundred cults just kill themselves peacefully as everybody knows.
[01:54:38.382 --> 01:54:48.528]  Most of them either kill people around them, kill themselves and kill some other group, or they do a kind of, you know, Sharon Tate type helter-skelter murder like Charlie Manson.
[01:54:49.108 --> 01:54:52.710]  Usually they kill innocents and you can say, well, let them kill themselves on their own compound.
[01:54:52.890 --> 01:54:53.991]  They're going to kill the kids!
[01:54:54.691 --> 01:54:57.613]  It's not these little kids' fault they've been drug into this lunatic asylum.
[01:54:59.214 --> 01:55:04.477]  And the SJWs and the cults that they create with mind control, classic conditioning,
[01:55:05.489 --> 01:55:13.856]  But the universities are then taken into the corporate world and into Silicon Valley because the reason they keep it all in San Francisco is so they can keep them all on that reservation.
[01:55:14.116 --> 01:55:18.580]  The cults at Twitter and Facebook and Google are just as whacked out and just as crazy.
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:23.083]  Well, there's famous cases where they said, you'll refer to me as your majesty.
[01:55:24.604 --> 01:55:29.028]  And beautiful, ornate, golden building and golden dragon, dragonette.
[01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:32.791]  And don't say mother and father.
[01:55:32.811 --> 01:55:34.252]  This is the world they've created.
[01:55:34.312 --> 01:55:34.933]  Now, that said,
[01:55:36.136 --> 01:55:37.617]  Our app has already gone to number one.
[01:55:38.378 --> 01:55:40.900]  I think they'll probably delete it or delist it.
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.560]  That's what they do.
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:42.401]  They already know we're number one.
[01:55:42.421 --> 01:55:43.642]  They just can't stand that.
[01:55:43.922 --> 01:55:47.785]  People don't want CNN, The Huffington Post, The New York Times, who have been up there with their apps for years.
[01:55:48.005 --> 01:55:48.946]  We beat them in three days.
[01:55:49.367 --> 01:55:50.187]  They can't stand it.
[01:55:50.207 --> 01:55:51.548]  We're already in the top 50 before that.
[01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:57.613]  And in the top 100, five of the apps are InfoWars apps made by fans.
[01:55:59.174 --> 01:56:00.315]  So they don't know what to do, folks.
[01:56:00.355 --> 01:56:01.796]  They know you've broken with them.
[01:56:01.856 --> 01:56:05.139]  They know you just want somebody at a gut level you know straight shooting him.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:15.685]  But the way you defeat them is sharing the articles and the videos and subscribing to the free podcast at Infowars.com for its long show that is not on Apple or not on Droid.
[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:18.331]  That's where everyone really needs to be right now.
[01:56:18.351 --> 01:56:24.556]  If you really don't want to be able to delete it, you go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and you'll find the video feeds, the audio feeds.
[01:56:24.976 --> 01:56:29.939]  But if you subscribe, then every day after the show's over, you'll get the podcast, boom, slammed in there.
[01:56:29.959 --> 01:56:30.880]  And then you can share it.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:34.302]  And the app right now, people say, hey, it's forbidden.
[01:56:34.482 --> 01:56:36.244]  It's gone to number one in news on both platforms.
[01:56:36.264 --> 01:56:40.767]  It's in the top 40 or so in general apps.
[01:56:42.679 --> 01:56:46.985]  Let's send it to number one as a message and make them then ban it once it's at number one.
[01:56:47.005 --> 01:56:54.274]  So everybody you know, tell them download the official InfoWars app right now at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:56:56.087 --> 01:56:57.707]  Wipe.com, we also have links there.
[01:56:57.787 --> 01:57:00.448]  And then finally, we're running some of the biggest specials ever.
[01:57:00.468 --> 01:57:06.669]  There's an emergency special, Stop the Bullying, Stop the Censorship, Save the Internet special, and InfoWareStore.com.
[01:57:06.749 --> 01:57:16.111]  And man, we got books and t-shirts and films and great supplements and water filtration, air filtration, and shortwave radios and survival gear and optics and just anything cool that I like, we got.
[01:57:16.551 --> 01:57:23.052]  We have the new I Am The Resistance, meaning you, t-shirt, the big red fist, taking those iconographies back.
[01:57:23.592 --> 01:57:25.713]  The power of you financially supporting us is the real veto on their censorship.
[01:57:25.733 --> 01:57:28.954]  And they're trying to hack us and de-platform us and take our DNS and our servers right now.
[01:57:28.974 --> 01:57:29.974]  But we're fighting back thanks to you!
[01:57:55.299 --> 01:58:00.661]  When you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[01:58:01.701 --> 01:58:05.082]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:58:05.502 --> 01:58:13.885]  It is you, the Infowarriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:58:14.225 --> 01:58:18.466]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:58:18.806 --> 01:58:19.647]  You are the Infowarrior.
[01:58:20.247 --> 01:58:23.768]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:58:24.517 --> 01:58:36.069]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:58:36.129 --> 01:58:46.019]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:52.902]  And they're trying to use InfoWars as an example of demonization to keep people from sharing this critical information.
[01:58:53.202 --> 01:58:57.484]  It's a model they admit they plan to use on everybody else once they're done with us.
[01:58:58.084 --> 01:59:07.108]  So when you promote the black sheep trailblazing information from NewsWars.com, from PrisonPlanet.com, from InfoWars.com, you are following in the footsteps
[01:59:07.208 --> 01:59:07.408]  I think?
[01:59:32.381 --> 01:59:34.462]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:34.783 --> 01:59:36.363]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:36.684 --> 01:59:38.225]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:38.845 --> 01:59:40.486]  And many others are across the world.
[01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:41.527]  We are the future.
[01:59:42.447 --> 01:59:43.388]  We are the renaissance.
[01:59:43.948 --> 01:59:45.209]  And we are winning.
[01:59:52.353 --> 01:59:58.257]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.053 --> 02:00:25.255]  You take a bunch of SJWs and you put them in control of big social networks and what do you get?
[02:00:25.355 --> 02:00:26.355]  You get tyranny.
[02:00:29.516 --> 02:00:30.596]  You get power trips.
[02:00:31.397 --> 02:00:32.517]  You get censorship.
[02:00:33.377 --> 02:00:34.637]  You get the new dark age.
[02:00:35.498 --> 02:00:46.781]  You know, Stephen Colbert, the guy that reads off teleprompters, the actor, the failed comedian in many respects, he's not his own man, who
[02:00:48.055 --> 02:00:49.577]  Poses like he's a newsman.
[02:00:50.358 --> 02:00:51.840]  Never called me a racist.
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:54.364]  Because they know you can get sued for that and it's not true.
[02:00:54.764 --> 02:00:57.147]  Until he thought this week I was taken off the air.
[02:00:57.888 --> 02:00:58.970]  200 plus radio stations.
[02:00:58.990 --> 02:01:00.372]  400 plus TV stations.
[02:01:01.173 --> 02:01:02.755]  Close to 100 cable stations.
[02:01:02.795 --> 02:01:03.836]  It'll be more next week.
[02:01:05.158 --> 02:01:05.599]  No Jack.
[02:01:07.506 --> 02:01:07.926]  We're not.
[02:01:09.087 --> 02:01:09.447]  Censored.
[02:01:09.708 --> 02:01:14.451]  And millions of people listening right now on our streams and video streams on our own server.
[02:01:14.991 --> 02:01:15.271]  Dummy.
[02:01:16.152 --> 02:01:21.856]  And our app number one in news from the top 40 to number one in just days.
[02:01:22.456 --> 02:01:23.137]  See how that works?
[02:01:23.277 --> 02:01:25.118]  Oh, your app isn't number one.
[02:01:27.339 --> 02:01:27.920]  See how that works?
[02:01:29.977 --> 02:01:34.641]  But look at this, if you go to Infowars.com, Colbert, Alex Jones banned for promoting race war.
[02:01:34.861 --> 02:01:35.401]  That's what he said.
[02:01:35.501 --> 02:01:36.622]  And then he didn't show where I said it.
[02:01:37.042 --> 02:01:37.903]  You go, oh, it's comedy.
[02:01:37.963 --> 02:01:38.363]  No, it's not.
[02:01:39.704 --> 02:01:41.005]  Then he gets out Gatorade.
[02:01:41.046 --> 02:01:42.847]  He calls it Haterade with a burning cross.
[02:01:43.447 --> 02:01:44.868]  Win the race and the war.
[02:01:46.630 --> 02:01:47.831]  Win the race and the race war.
[02:01:49.232 --> 02:01:51.013]  So this is what they've stooped to.
[02:01:52.174 --> 02:01:56.017]  And then a swarm of bees destroys me, which is an allegory of what they're doing to me.
[02:01:57.418 --> 02:01:58.319]  So here it is.
[02:01:58.419 --> 02:01:59.239]  Let's go ahead and
[02:02:00.373 --> 02:02:00.753]  Roll this.
[02:02:02.013 --> 02:02:05.775]  I'm still broadcasting from a nation's last bastion of free speech.
[02:02:06.235 --> 02:02:08.955]  The in-house web player on the whole page.
[02:02:08.996 --> 02:02:09.776]  Hit pause again.
[02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:13.697]  Notice, they're the ones really trying to censor things, saying they want speech shut down.
[02:02:14.017 --> 02:02:16.098]  Democrat Senators saying shut all Republicans down.
[02:02:16.138 --> 02:02:18.998]  Just incredible stuff that should end them forever.
[02:02:19.379 --> 02:02:20.819]  But he makes it a joke.
[02:02:21.219 --> 02:02:24.320]  I'm broadcasting from the last bastion of freedom here.
[02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:25.620]  That brain fight.
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:27.501]  And you can't even do it as good as I do.
[02:02:29.411 --> 02:02:31.313]  Let me pour some of this on my head here.
[02:02:31.353 --> 02:02:33.074]  So let's go back to this guy.
[02:02:33.374 --> 02:02:36.517]  Let's go back to John Podesta's good personal friend.
[02:02:36.577 --> 02:02:38.398]  Reportedly they spent a lot of time together.
[02:02:38.758 --> 02:02:39.159]  Here it is.
[02:02:39.739 --> 02:02:45.464]  HaterAid, the knockoff sports drink for athletic Klansmen, okay?
[02:02:45.884 --> 02:02:49.707]  This is the only cream-based sports drink for sale.
[02:02:49.727 --> 02:02:50.408]  Alright, pause.
[02:02:50.448 --> 02:02:51.469]  Back it up ten seconds.
[02:02:51.809 --> 02:02:53.170]  So people make jokes about this.
[02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:57.554]  Oh, it's a joke, but I go out, or Candace Owens goes out, who's a classical liberal black lady,
[02:02:58.254 --> 02:03:00.475]  And they scream, Nazi, Nazi, scum, go away, KKK.
[02:03:00.595 --> 02:03:02.616]  And you're like, I'm not in the KKK.
[02:03:02.696 --> 02:03:04.778]  And they don't care, because Colbert said it.
[02:03:04.818 --> 02:03:07.979]  See, this is the... So they get to act like real Nazis.
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:10.020]  And Colbert knows this psychology.
[02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:15.563]  So the average idiot that still watches TV thinks it's cool to follow this guy.
[02:03:15.603 --> 02:03:16.264]  Here, here, here, let's go.
[02:03:17.284 --> 02:03:21.747]  The knockoff sports drink for athletic Klansmen, okay?
[02:03:22.167 --> 02:03:27.431]  This is the only cream-based sports drink for sale on the dark web.
[02:03:27.831 --> 02:03:32.534]  Haterade, win the race, and the race war, alright?
[02:03:34.015 --> 02:03:35.176]  Now it's a slippery slope.
[02:03:36.078 --> 02:03:48.335]  If they can de-platform Tuck Budford, next thing you know they'll be coming after me for so-called child support, which I owe to my ex-wife, who I miss desperately.
[02:03:49.577 --> 02:03:52.761]  President Trump, I need you to do the right thing, alright?
[02:03:53.201 --> 02:04:00.509]  Help Tuck, then mow me 50 bucks, or China will win the midterms, alright?
[02:04:00.529 --> 02:04:06.555]  Alright, so, all that's a little hat tip to my ex-wife, and all this other stuff and how they want to shut our money down.
[02:04:07.196 --> 02:04:08.517]  That's how they went over free speech.
[02:04:08.597 --> 02:04:19.926]  And again, or China will win the next deal because they're only taking over NOAA with Chinese messages and they only own the debt, they only took over Hollywood, they're only threatening to take over Apple yesterday if they don't submit to them.
[02:04:19.986 --> 02:04:25.370]  It's no big deal to have a foreign communist dictatorship threatening to seize Apple in China if we don't submit.
[02:04:25.410 --> 02:04:28.713]  That's not a problem at all if you're a New York, actual Canadian
[02:04:29.533 --> 02:04:37.459]  You know, anti-American guy like Stephen Colbert who thinks he's really, really funny when he's got over a hundred riders filling all this crap out for him.
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:41.882]  So hey, you think the bees are after us, Bubba?
[02:04:43.134 --> 02:04:45.375]  The little bumblebees are after you.
[02:04:46.536 --> 02:04:58.262]  And censorship doesn't turn out too well most of the time, and that's why I haven't checked the numbers since 5.6 million people subscribed to the podcast and downloaded the... and sent us their emails.
[02:04:58.302 --> 02:05:00.043]  We can stay in contact at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:04.574 --> 02:05:05.034]  Have you heard?
[02:05:05.495 --> 02:05:07.576]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[02:05:07.656 --> 02:05:08.957]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:05:09.117 --> 02:05:10.177]  They're all censoring us.
[02:05:10.537 --> 02:05:16.421]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[02:05:16.741 --> 02:05:19.763]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[02:05:30.768 --> 02:05:34.951]  Everything we do here at InfoWars is possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:34.971 --> 02:05:36.092]  We have huge specials.
[02:05:36.112 --> 02:05:39.694]  If you've not seen the InfoWars store yet, go check it out.
[02:05:40.154 --> 02:05:44.597]  New t-shirts at the InfoWars store as well, including one that I just got.
[02:05:45.018 --> 02:05:47.599]  The new InfoWars hexagon logo.
[02:05:47.799 --> 02:05:55.865]  Very, very cool logo and kind of more discreet so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[02:05:56.145 --> 02:05:58.987]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:59.027 --> 02:06:00.488]  Huge discount store wide right now.
[02:06:01.648 --> 02:06:06.731]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.759 --> 02:06:27.541]  There's a lot of controversy around the network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:06:32.508 --> 02:06:44.073]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[02:06:44.093 --> 02:06:45.674]  Scum!
[02:06:46.515 --> 02:06:48.475]  Russian scum!
[02:06:48.515 --> 02:06:54.018]  Intel Wars comes to mind.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.541]  Your reputation is amazing.
[02:06:59.981 --> 02:07:01.322]  I will not let you down.
[02:07:01.442 --> 02:07:04.364]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:07:14.218 --> 02:07:21.724]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[02:07:22.204 --> 02:07:36.315]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[02:07:36.775 --> 02:07:43.660]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through full space, where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:45.541]  So, when the history books are written,
[02:08:14.468 --> 02:08:15.809]  This is the big de-platforming.
[02:08:15.829 --> 02:08:21.094]  This is the Chinese style net censorship slash social score system in their own words.
[02:08:22.175 --> 02:08:23.697]  China and Apple have moved to China.
[02:08:24.958 --> 02:08:26.099]  They are openly censoring.
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:28.582]  It is a crazy time to be alive.
[02:08:28.602 --> 02:08:32.786]  They're lying about what I say and what I do to create the straw man to carry that out.
[02:08:34.087 --> 02:08:36.310]  But I've got 200 plus radio stations.
[02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:39.053]  I've got 400, 500 plus TV stations.
[02:08:39.133 --> 02:08:40.295]  I just got good word during the break.
[02:08:40.916 --> 02:08:42.397]  Hundreds of stations are calling.
[02:08:43.018 --> 02:08:44.500]  Hand over fist picking them up.
[02:08:45.221 --> 02:08:46.983]  People are like, we're sick of this censorship.
[02:08:47.003 --> 02:08:47.684]  We know what's going on.
[02:08:48.505 --> 02:08:49.086]  But here's the issue.
[02:08:51.977 --> 02:09:00.744]  Just like when they censored conservatives in the media and made AM radio come back in the 80s, the same thing's happening for FM radio, UHF, VHF cable.
[02:09:00.984 --> 02:09:12.353]  But that's still not a good thing because for the average comedian or the average libertarian or just, you know, common sense talk show host or whoever it is or people working in companies, they're all being fired
[02:09:13.999 --> 02:09:14.680]  Are you kidding?
[02:09:35.735 --> 02:09:37.217]  Owen's nice wife at Twitter.
[02:09:38.278 --> 02:09:40.760]  So he has been blackballed.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:41.942]  He has been blacklisted.
[02:09:41.962 --> 02:09:43.083]  And I know about his story.
[02:09:43.103 --> 02:09:44.504]  At first, it was behind the scenes.
[02:09:44.524 --> 02:09:47.347]  He submitted a little bit, but it got so bad, he couldn't.
[02:09:47.828 --> 02:09:49.069]  And so now he's been deplatformed.
[02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.730]  He's been blocked.
[02:09:49.770 --> 02:09:50.991]  Even Seinfeld complains.
[02:09:51.011 --> 02:09:52.813]  I mean, all the big comics complain.
[02:09:52.833 --> 02:09:56.457]  I guess Seinfeld told his daughter two years ago, we've played the audio.
[02:09:58.015 --> 02:09:59.896]  They go, you know, we live out in the country in upstate New York.
[02:09:59.916 --> 02:10:02.237]  We're gonna move back to New York so you can meet more boys.
[02:10:02.297 --> 02:10:04.138]  She goes, that's sexist to say the word boy.
[02:10:04.158 --> 02:10:05.439]  And he went, wow, you're in a cult.
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:08.821]  And so people won't go to the universities anymore.
[02:10:08.901 --> 02:10:10.422]  It just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:10:10.442 --> 02:10:18.946]  And then they people big tech with these university folks who love China selling organs of dissidence and killing Christians or Buddhists or any of that's cool.
[02:10:19.006 --> 02:10:21.328]  But my God, if you criticize Burkas.
[02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:27.371]  Got the new Burka Barbie thing here.
[02:10:29.159 --> 02:10:29.979]  I went to the mall the other day.
[02:10:29.999 --> 02:10:31.440]  I took my daughter to the Cheesecake Factory.
[02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:35.802]  And I mean, there was women in burkas walking around, eating their food under their deals.
[02:10:35.842 --> 02:10:39.023]  And imagine, they make them do this in those countries where they're beaten or killed.
[02:10:39.044 --> 02:10:40.024]  I mean, you talk about the feminists.
[02:10:40.044 --> 02:10:41.204]  This is like what prisoners wear.
[02:10:41.865 --> 02:10:42.885]  Except it was actually like this.
[02:10:42.965 --> 02:10:44.506]  It was like, the whole face was covered.
[02:10:44.586 --> 02:10:49.248]  It was like, and they would like lift it up and eat the food under it.
[02:10:49.568 --> 02:10:52.590]  And then I'm hateful, and I'm a right winger, and I think that's crazy.
[02:10:54.372 --> 02:10:55.513]  We don't want to let her face get seen.
[02:10:55.533 --> 02:10:56.833]  She can get beheaded if that happens.
[02:10:56.853 --> 02:10:58.614]  So we're going to do the broadcast.
[02:10:58.634 --> 02:11:00.155]  We're down with Owen Benjamin for the rest of the hour.
[02:11:00.415 --> 02:11:02.876]  We'll open the phones up on censorship towards the end with him.
[02:11:03.217 --> 02:11:04.537]  We have a special guest joining us after that.
[02:11:05.618 --> 02:11:06.759]  But Owen, good to have you on.
[02:11:06.859 --> 02:11:13.102]  I know you want to just recount your experiences as a thought criminal of what's going on.
[02:11:13.162 --> 02:11:16.824]  So I appreciate you as a comedian that's been through all this joining us.
[02:11:17.844 --> 02:11:18.725]  Thanks for having me, man.
[02:11:19.025 --> 02:11:19.546]  Big fan.
[02:11:20.026 --> 02:11:23.691]  You know, what happened to me is a similar thing that happened to you.
[02:11:23.751 --> 02:11:39.308]  I had like 125,000 Twitter followers and I had the blue checkmark and everything and I was banned for life from Twitter the same day that I was kicked off YouTube for live streaming because of my criticism of David Hogg in a funny tweet.
[02:11:40.146 --> 02:11:47.530]  And I'd already made fun of the establishment comedians, and I'd been approved by so many of these gatekeepers.
[02:11:47.550 --> 02:11:49.651]  Like, I have two Comedy Central specials.
[02:11:49.691 --> 02:11:53.072]  I was a regular on Sullivan & Son on TBS for three years.
[02:11:53.132 --> 02:11:54.793]  I've done Leno and Fallon and all these things.
[02:11:55.334 --> 02:12:03.958]  And I did this one tweet where it had all the late night comedians, and I said, everybody here endorsed Hillary Clinton, and they have the same stance on everything, ladies and gentlemen, comedy.
[02:12:04.538 --> 02:12:10.862]  And it got like 50,000 retweets and it ruffled so many feathers that I think that put the mark on me.
[02:12:11.463 --> 02:12:16.606]  You know, I would openly say like Stephen Colbert's Rachel Maddow with failed jokes and people would just get angry.
[02:12:17.475 --> 02:12:21.578]  And, um, but they can't take you down, you know, you just find new platforms and it's all good.
[02:12:21.758 --> 02:12:22.518]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:12:22.698 --> 02:12:30.863]  In the real world, in like eight Islamic countries, if a woman didn't wear a burqa and got caught driving a car, she'd be caned or even stoned or killed by her family.
[02:12:31.564 --> 02:12:33.465]  Now, they'll say, oh, you're banned from putting down Islam.
[02:12:33.505 --> 02:12:34.766]  No, this is what Islam is.
[02:12:34.786 --> 02:12:45.032]  And if you want to do like Monty Python, Monty Python today would have, you know, behead Barbie, you know, beheaded Barbie with a guillotine or stoned Barbie where she's caught without her burqa.
[02:12:45.772 --> 02:12:52.976]  You know, just for a second at dinner, if it falls down, if it just falls down for a second, she is in stone to death.
[02:12:53.977 --> 02:12:56.018]  To me, that's not comedy, but it's a way to illustrate it.
[02:12:56.298 --> 02:13:02.062]  Because it's so obvious, we're not allowed to point out the obvious that Birka Barbie is not allowed to drive a car.
[02:13:02.502 --> 02:13:03.803]  And that we're the feminists on this.
[02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:08.965]  Right, but that is comedy, and that's why they're so terrified of comedy, is because Burka Barbie.
[02:13:09.425 --> 02:13:14.407]  I saw a sketch out of, I think, Brazil, where it was all these women and Burkas shopping for clothes.
[02:13:15.048 --> 02:13:20.370]  And the whole, the juxtaposition is just that all the clothes are the same and no one can see anyone's face.
[02:13:20.570 --> 02:13:22.231]  Sure, what about, exactly, Burkinis?
[02:13:23.172 --> 02:13:23.572]  Yeah!
[02:13:24.133 --> 02:13:24.913]  Yeah, it's a joke.
[02:13:24.973 --> 02:13:27.235]  I have a video called, It's Time to Submit to Tolerance.
[02:13:27.255 --> 02:13:32.079]  Like, I do these funny PSAs where it's like, it's time to give our guns to Hitler.
[02:13:32.619 --> 02:13:38.744]  You know, where it just shows the irony, the cognitive dissonance of the left, that they just don't see how funny it is.
[02:13:38.764 --> 02:13:45.729]  And I think that's why they took over comedy, because comedy is always the Achilles heel of totalitarianism, because you just point out
[02:13:46.609 --> 02:13:58.821]  The emperor having no clothes, you know, like they're saying Donald Trump is Hitler and then they say now give your guns to Hitler and it would be These these funny fit and the one for I did about Islam was uh, it's time to submit to tolerance
[02:13:59.525 --> 02:14:12.769]  You know, even the language they're using is so ironic that it's hysterical and that's what scares them and that's why they need comedians to all just be propagandists at this point and not be the balancing counterweight of society.
[02:14:13.029 --> 02:14:21.711]  I was at CAA and my agent dropped me when I publicly stood against a guy who was saying his five-year-old son was a girl and was planning on giving him
[02:14:24.512 --> 02:14:39.177]  Well, that's the third rail, is like Camille Pagli, who's a liberal lesbian, says, telling five-year-olds they're a girl or a boy and giving them injections is real child abuse.
[02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:44.839]  The parents are projecting this onto them, and then you say anything about it, you're banned.
[02:14:44.899 --> 02:14:46.060]  That's like the religion.
[02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:48.311]  Oh, it is a religion.
[02:14:48.371 --> 02:14:50.333]  It's a godless, state-driven religion.
[02:14:50.494 --> 02:14:59.363]  And I think anyone who's even mildly Christian or Jewish or just they don't have their god in the state.
[02:14:59.443 --> 02:15:00.425]  It's so obvious.
[02:15:01.372 --> 02:15:03.633]  Uh, what they're doing and you're not as susceptible to it.
[02:15:03.653 --> 02:15:06.875]  You know, like, um, uh, veganism is kosher.
[02:15:06.895 --> 02:15:10.996]  Uh, original sin is white people and slavery.
[02:15:11.016 --> 02:15:14.798]  You know, they have this structure of... And it's all about guilt.
[02:15:14.958 --> 02:15:17.579]  It's the worst components of false Christianity and Judaism.
[02:15:17.619 --> 02:15:20.521]  The whole Pharisees that Christ taught about, they are the Pharisees.
[02:15:21.201 --> 02:15:21.742]  A hundred percent.
[02:15:21.762 --> 02:15:22.882]  They're trying to make priest class.
[02:15:22.902 --> 02:15:29.367]  They're trying to make a class of people that won't be taken down for doing the very things that they tell us.
[02:15:29.388 --> 02:15:32.430]  And notice the light at the New York Times that says whites are subhuman and should be exterminated.
[02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:33.771]  She's part of the priest class.
[02:15:33.791 --> 02:15:36.213]  She's not a white male, so she's allowed to, but you're not.
[02:15:37.034 --> 02:15:37.454]  Of course.
[02:15:38.154 --> 02:15:43.378]  And Asians make more money than white people per capita in America, and there's more of them in the world, so it makes no sense.
[02:15:45.049 --> 02:15:45.849]  It's unbelievable.
[02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:48.311]  The left has looked at demographics.
[02:15:48.331 --> 02:15:49.811]  They've decided to go hardcore racist.
[02:15:50.312 --> 02:15:51.993]  As you said, the political correctness is a new religion.
[02:15:52.113 --> 02:15:54.674]  Owen Benjamin, blacklisted comedian.
[02:15:54.834 --> 02:15:55.975]  We'll talk to him straight ahead.
[02:15:55.995 --> 02:15:56.415]  Stay with us.
[02:15:59.704 --> 02:16:00.625]  We knew it was coming.
[02:16:00.645 --> 02:16:02.206]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[02:16:02.527 --> 02:16:15.738]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[02:16:16.659 --> 02:16:17.400]  And then voila!
[02:16:18.612 --> 02:16:28.720]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds.
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:48.215]  And so their answer is, have CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and all these other corrupt organizations openly lobby for us to be removed and then organize their listeners, their viewers, the different university organizations, Antifa, sleeping giants, and a bunch of other groups
[02:16:49.236 --> 02:16:59.666]  To then go mass flag us in the community guidelines, which again is something out of 1984 or a Kafka novel, where you don't even know what you've supposedly done.
[02:16:59.686 --> 02:17:01.208]  You can't face your accuser.
[02:17:01.649 --> 02:17:06.774]  Then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[02:17:07.861 --> 02:17:21.568]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent in their own words for you, nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:26.831]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[02:17:27.511 --> 02:17:30.133]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key.
[02:17:30.533 --> 02:17:34.255]  Apple has officially moved to China and is letting the government basically run Apple.
[02:17:35.456 --> 02:17:36.337]  That, of course, is iTunes.
[02:17:36.757 --> 02:17:43.423]  Google is building a huge censorship search engine for them, and whistleblowers from inside Google say they're preparing to use it here in America.
[02:17:44.464 --> 02:17:51.891]  In fact, they're beta testing different parts of the censorship system for China on American conservatives, nationalists, and Trump supporters.
[02:17:52.471 --> 02:17:58.036]  The bigger issue is, they don't like InfoWars exposing the fact in great detail.
[02:17:58.797 --> 02:18:11.482]  The fact that Communist China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda operations and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to block the Trump agenda.
[02:18:11.762 --> 02:18:13.362]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[02:18:13.442 --> 02:18:15.763]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[02:18:16.203 --> 02:18:25.487]  It's happening right now and it's designed to silence the American people and other populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate totalitarianism.
[02:18:26.007 --> 02:18:31.009]  This now becomes the last battle of the Civil War.
[02:18:31.089 --> 02:18:36.651]  You know, Fox, Breitbart, Sinclair, and Alex Jones, which has now been taken off Facebook, thank God.
[02:18:37.211 --> 02:18:43.074]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing others is to simply

[02:18:53.517 --> 02:19:04.900]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:09.341]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:19:09.841 --> 02:19:12.702]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[02:19:13.242 --> 02:19:18.104]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[02:19:18.364 --> 02:19:19.665]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[02:19:20.065 --> 02:19:20.685]  You're an adult.
[02:19:21.025 --> 02:19:23.026]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[02:19:23.366 --> 02:19:28.008]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make your own decision.
[02:19:28.768 --> 02:19:32.310]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[02:19:32.670 --> 02:19:32.870]  Listen.
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:35.341]  I was never trying to win a popularity contest.
[02:19:35.481 --> 02:19:39.104]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's happening.
[02:19:39.365 --> 02:19:40.165]  We've been very successful.
[02:19:40.606 --> 02:19:41.787]  I've expected to be attacked.
[02:19:41.807 --> 02:19:45.270]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear, but it's happened.
[02:19:45.730 --> 02:19:50.554]  So now, Infowars is the banner of free speech, the renaissance in Western culture and civilization.
[02:19:50.574 --> 02:19:58.821]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to fall against your cherished free speech, and you'll lose everything else if you don't stand up for it now.
[02:20:03.508 --> 02:20:08.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.431 --> 02:20:25.836]  We now take you live to the most hated, most censored broadcast in the world by tyrants.
[02:20:26.157 --> 02:20:32.199]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:20:36.477 --> 02:20:37.458]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:20:37.578 --> 02:20:39.480]  We're going back to our guest Owen Benjamin here in a moment.
[02:20:40.401 --> 02:20:41.282]  This is no joke.
[02:20:42.023 --> 02:20:43.764]  I've had four other apps.
[02:20:44.725 --> 02:20:46.447]  One of them had like nine million people download it.
[02:20:46.587 --> 02:20:47.428]  The others were okay.
[02:20:47.548 --> 02:20:49.430]  One of them we put out last year and had some problems.
[02:20:49.450 --> 02:20:50.010]  We got rid of it.
[02:20:50.711 --> 02:20:51.392]  This one's free.
[02:20:52.864 --> 02:20:55.546]  And we put it out three and a half weeks ago and it was already in the top 40.
[02:20:56.047 --> 02:20:59.130]  Now it's number one on news on Apple and Android.
[02:20:59.750 --> 02:21:04.194]  So they did this new thing where they would just delist it and you couldn't scroll up to number one on Droid, but now it's back.
[02:21:04.594 --> 02:21:06.296]  On Apple they moved it back a few spaces.
[02:21:06.336 --> 02:21:07.897]  I don't know how you go to number one and they move it back.
[02:21:08.398 --> 02:21:11.640]  But Tim Cook says they're watching it very closely.
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.861]  They're listening right now.
[02:21:13.362 --> 02:21:14.683]  They've moved to China officially.
[02:21:14.703 --> 02:21:16.585]  They're helping round up the population there.
[02:21:16.625 --> 02:21:17.746]  They're helping spawn everybody.
[02:21:19.491 --> 02:21:24.032]  And don't worry, BuzzFeed, they were told, we're watching Alex and listening right now.
[02:21:24.132 --> 02:21:25.332]  Boy, isn't that American.
[02:21:26.333 --> 02:21:27.253]  And what have you heard here?
[02:21:28.493 --> 02:21:32.514]  Man, I'm with my wife and three daughters at the mall, there's all these women in full burkas.
[02:21:33.534 --> 02:21:37.355]  And it freaked me out, because I know under their culture, they kill those women if they don't wear those.
[02:21:37.675 --> 02:21:38.656]  They stone them to death.
[02:21:39.036 --> 02:21:39.996]  That freaks me out.
[02:21:40.476 --> 02:21:42.137]  That makes me a bigot against women.
[02:21:43.817 --> 02:21:47.358]  So first it's a job, Barbie, actually rolled out, but now we've got burka Barbie.
[02:21:48.255 --> 02:21:51.216]  Briefly here, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:21:51.556 --> 02:21:56.037]  You can get the Droid app, you can get the other apps for Android.
[02:21:56.057 --> 02:21:57.998]  There's a whole bunch of other apps other people have made.
[02:21:58.038 --> 02:21:59.018]  Some work good, some don't.
[02:22:00.619 --> 02:22:07.161]  Ours is excellent, but the most important thing you should do while record audiences are tuned in is InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:22:07.301 --> 02:22:09.361]  Go subscribe to our podcast.
[02:22:10.041 --> 02:22:15.003]  All Apple, iTunes, and Stetcher did, we had like 9 million subscribers, 10 million subscribers almost,
[02:22:16.328 --> 02:22:17.269]  Was delist us.
[02:22:17.449 --> 02:22:19.151]  They were just streaming our bandwidth.
[02:22:19.211 --> 02:22:19.972]  We paid for it.
[02:22:19.992 --> 02:22:23.056]  And then they just made money off putting advertising on it.
[02:22:23.697 --> 02:22:24.838]  They blew all that away.
[02:22:24.878 --> 02:22:30.525]  They said, you can't choose to come to our platform that you use on your phone that you thought was just a playlist you created.
[02:22:30.765 --> 02:22:34.189]  They're saying, you can't listen to the Rolling Stones, or you can't listen to...
[02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:36.267]  Whatever it is.
[02:22:36.327 --> 02:22:37.528]  You can't listen to John Williams.
[02:22:37.989 --> 02:22:39.671]  You can't listen to Alex Jones.
[02:22:39.711 --> 02:22:40.251]  Think about that.
[02:22:40.492 --> 02:22:42.053]  And it's not because I wasn't popular.
[02:22:42.414 --> 02:22:43.495]  It's because we're number one.
[02:22:43.515 --> 02:22:44.516]  I went on Joe Rogan's show.
[02:22:44.997 --> 02:22:46.699]  Known Joe for, you know, since 1998.
[02:22:47.179 --> 02:22:48.361]  Been on his show only one time.
[02:22:48.941 --> 02:22:50.583]  Best podcast he ever did, highest rated.
[02:22:50.904 --> 02:22:52.846]  Wouldn't even list it in iTunes as number one.
[02:22:54.952 --> 02:22:59.075]  So, it's not that Owen Benjamin wasn't successful.
[02:22:59.735 --> 02:23:01.216]  It's that he was successful.
[02:23:01.276 --> 02:23:05.599]  It was that he was getting 50,000 retweets, and I've seen him on TV myself, and I barely pay attention.
[02:23:05.859 --> 02:23:06.800]  He was a funny guy.
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:08.881]  And so, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:23:09.021 --> 02:23:10.582]  You don't make jokes about that.
[02:23:10.622 --> 02:23:23.511]  So, get into more of how you were persecuted, where it's gone now, and then let's tell some of these verboten jokes that have got you banned off Twitter and that you're blocked from doing here, because they can have jihadis on there calling for Trump's death, and that's okay.
[02:23:24.915 --> 02:23:27.117]  Yeah, I mean, it's pretty fascinating.
[02:23:27.217 --> 02:23:30.820]  The Russians had this saying, the tallest nail gets hammered down.
[02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:41.849]  And I think that's one reason why leftists don't like people that are popular or good at their craft, because it's a threat to this godless caliphate that they're trying to organize.
[02:23:41.869 --> 02:23:44.431]  And their whole slacker world of being lazy idiots.
[02:23:45.271 --> 02:23:46.412]  Well, yeah, that's what they're promoting.
[02:23:46.432 --> 02:23:49.595]  And they also don't like the nuclear family.
[02:23:49.615 --> 02:23:52.017]  They don't like the fact that I'm married with children.
[02:23:52.902 --> 02:23:56.906]  And that I respect my wife and I post pictures of my children being awesome.
[02:23:56.926 --> 02:23:57.267]  Well, let's say it.
[02:23:57.287 --> 02:23:58.868]  You're also an effing white male.
[02:23:59.129 --> 02:24:03.433]  Which isn't the minorities pushing it, it's effing professors who want to create a racial divide.
[02:24:04.634 --> 02:24:04.855]  Yeah.
[02:24:04.895 --> 02:24:06.196]  Say it like H. Grelick said.
[02:24:06.376 --> 02:24:07.697]  You're an effing white male!
[02:24:07.958 --> 02:24:09.800]  You don't have a right to talk, Owen Benjamin!
[02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:10.881]  Shut up!
[02:24:11.778 --> 02:24:13.599]  Yeah, and it's the modern Marxism.
[02:24:14.159 --> 02:24:19.502]  Marxism failed when it was the haves and have-nots, so they just shifted it to race.
[02:24:19.542 --> 02:24:23.783]  They just have another nonsense division that they use to hide meritocracy.
[02:24:23.803 --> 02:24:24.304]  That's it.
[02:24:24.344 --> 02:24:26.785]  The class warfare failed, so they went to race warfare.
[02:24:27.265 --> 02:24:29.206]  Exactly, and it's so obvious when you see it.
[02:24:29.366 --> 02:24:34.208]  You know, once you see it, it's just... And it's pathetic how most comedians have responded.
[02:24:34.248 --> 02:24:35.388]  They just all took the knee.
[02:24:35.908 --> 02:24:41.911]  And I had this big deal with a publisher, and I remember my dad was like, why do you have to say what you say?
[02:24:41.971 --> 02:24:45.292]  Just don't say it for a month, and then get your book out.
[02:24:45.312 --> 02:24:47.553]  And I was like, but once you take a knee, you never get up.
[02:24:47.673 --> 02:24:48.974]  And I've seen that over and over again.
[02:24:49.014 --> 02:24:49.994]  You can't fudge it.
[02:24:50.454 --> 02:24:51.675]  You have to go all or nothing.
[02:24:53.375 --> 02:24:57.338]  It's a bummer what happened to you, but at the same time, it's like the Obi-Wan Kenobi effect.
[02:24:57.378 --> 02:25:03.844]  I don't think they realized that striking someone down actually validates their original point, and that happened to me.
[02:25:04.445 --> 02:25:05.566]  They tried to erase me.
[02:25:06.326 --> 02:25:13.633]  One minute I'm entertaining the Martin Scorseses of the world, and Anne Hathaway's on stage saying she's a big fan of mine, and the next minute they just try to wipe me.
[02:25:14.233 --> 02:25:21.541]  And all it did is increase the grassroots ability of me touring and for me to produce my own specials.
[02:25:21.982 --> 02:25:24.785]  Like now I just shoot and produce my own specials for my website.
[02:25:24.865 --> 02:25:27.868]  I don't go through the normal... And let me make a wild guess.
[02:25:27.928 --> 02:25:29.390]  You're more successful now than before.
[02:25:29.490 --> 02:25:30.792]  Plus you're in control of your own dusting.
[02:25:31.365 --> 02:25:31.765]  Yeah.
[02:25:31.985 --> 02:25:35.608]  And I gave it up when I first took that stand with the trans kids thing.
[02:25:35.668 --> 02:25:38.029]  I went back to doing lumber, like tree work.
[02:25:38.069 --> 02:25:40.331]  My brother's a lumberjack, arborist type guy.
[02:25:40.371 --> 02:25:46.935]  And so I was doing grounds work for 20 bucks an hour right after having a giant development deal.
[02:25:47.535 --> 02:25:55.124]  And I think that ability of giving it all up is why I made it through when I said I won't be a part of what you guys are a part of.
[02:25:55.144 --> 02:25:55.484]  Exactly.
[02:25:55.644 --> 02:25:58.648]  Zinning out and going back to being like a farmer or an arborist.
[02:25:59.148 --> 02:26:02.031]  And wasn't it kind of zoning out, empowering, doing that manual labor?
[02:26:02.071 --> 02:26:04.274]  Like eight hours goes by and you're like, feel great.
[02:26:05.276 --> 02:26:13.027]  I do it now just because I realized it was what was keeping anxiety and depression at bay because I think human beings are made to work with their hands.
[02:26:13.628 --> 02:26:21.478]  And so I did that to financially get out of the... because I even tweeted, like, UConn, University of Connecticut, because of my trans
[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:25.041]  Let's tell the story in full.
[02:26:25.081 --> 02:26:31.686]  Shane, you're going to drug your five-year-old to change their sex when it doesn't even do that and advertising it on top of it.
[02:26:32.027 --> 02:26:33.808]  Who talks about their kid's sexual issues?
[02:26:33.868 --> 02:26:35.409]  Who sexualizes children?
[02:26:35.429 --> 02:26:36.590]  You let them grow up to who they are.
[02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:38.191]  That's a real liberal perspective.
[02:26:38.232 --> 02:26:41.054]  Not, I'm going to tell my kid, do you want to be a girl?
[02:26:41.074 --> 02:26:43.796]  Well, then you really are one because it gives me attention or something.
[02:26:44.614 --> 02:26:45.354]  Oh, it's insane.
[02:26:45.434 --> 02:26:49.475]  And the fact that when I was a little kid, when I was that age, I would play classical piano.
[02:26:49.535 --> 02:26:51.315]  That's why my website's Huge Pianist.
[02:26:51.395 --> 02:26:52.616]  I'm 6'7 and I play piano.
[02:26:52.656 --> 02:26:57.377]  But I think about it, I'm like, would I have been seen as trans?
[02:26:57.437 --> 02:27:01.338]  Because when I was three, I just wanted to play piano and not play sports.
[02:27:01.498 --> 02:27:03.438]  You know, it's... Oh, that's an exact thing.
[02:27:03.658 --> 02:27:05.859]  I rampaged through a ton of women when I was really young.
[02:27:05.879 --> 02:27:10.099]  And for about two years, I got real cerebral when I was about 20 and into politics.
[02:27:10.119 --> 02:27:12.160]  I remember my mom coming over and saying, are you gay?
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:13.642]  You used to have all these women around.
[02:27:13.682 --> 02:27:15.103]  I said, no, I went to another phase.
[02:27:15.164 --> 02:27:15.844]  No, I'm not gay.
[02:27:15.865 --> 02:27:19.389]  I was totally empty dating three, four girls a week, if you want to know.
[02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:22.253]  And I said, okay, so I've got another perspective.
[02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:23.615]  And I went and got married after that.
[02:27:24.056 --> 02:27:24.556]  Exactly.
[02:27:24.596 --> 02:27:30.104]  It's like this whole thing of like, you play piano or you like flowers, so you must want to have your penis chopped off.
[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:59.925]  Well, yeah, and of course the irony is the left is now becoming the most ridiculous caricature of sexist you can imagine, where if you have any inclination at all towards any type of feminine thing, and everybody has little bits of it, you know, it's like, like I'll get jammed up watching The Notebook or something, you know, and my wife is good at engineering, she's a stay-at-home mom, but she's really good at math, you know, so in the leftist world, that means that I should chop my wiener off and she should wear overalls.
[02:28:00.385 --> 02:28:08.433]  You know, it's just it's mind-blowing how any quality you have that makes you an individual they put into a demographic and then they ruin your life.
[02:28:09.034 --> 02:28:18.623]  And and so when I took that stance and I named the guy Jesse Thorne, he's a an NPR guy with a lot of friends in Hollywood and because I don't believe in this whole nebulous.
[02:28:18.744 --> 02:28:19.905]  I'm here to fight against.
[02:28:20.922 --> 02:28:21.822]  Well, that's what it is.
[02:28:21.842 --> 02:28:22.283]  You told the truth.
[02:28:22.303 --> 02:28:23.363]  Owen Benjamin, you're on fire.
[02:28:23.383 --> 02:28:25.664]  We'll come back and cover it all straight ahead.
[02:28:25.684 --> 02:28:26.524]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:26.564 --> 02:28:27.584]  This is the InfoWar.
[02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:45.372]  NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:28:49.454 --> 02:28:51.715]  But what you really need to do is sign up for the free podcast.
[02:28:51.735 --> 02:28:56.178]  And remember, we are literally gaining 30 or 40 TV stations a day.
[02:28:56.638 --> 02:28:57.899]  This is blowing up in their face.
[02:29:00.781 --> 02:29:05.443]  And all these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[02:29:05.543 --> 02:29:06.224]  So I'm here
[02:29:09.053 --> 02:29:10.294]  Stop the hammering!
[02:29:10.754 --> 02:29:12.235]  Stop the hammering out there!
[02:29:12.255 --> 02:29:13.096]  Who's got a hammer?
[02:29:13.376 --> 02:29:13.876]  Where is it?
[02:29:14.216 --> 02:29:14.516]  Hammering!
[02:29:14.877 --> 02:29:15.277]  Hammering!
[02:29:15.537 --> 02:29:15.977]  Hammering!
[02:29:16.197 --> 02:29:16.638]  Hammering!
[02:29:16.998 --> 02:29:17.899]  Where's the hammer?
[02:29:18.719 --> 02:29:20.540]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor!
[02:29:20.660 --> 02:29:22.782]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering!
[02:29:22.982 --> 02:29:23.302]  Hammering!
[02:29:23.642 --> 02:29:24.022]  Hammering!
[02:29:24.303 --> 02:29:24.703]  Hammering!
[02:29:24.963 --> 02:29:25.383]  Hammering!
[02:29:25.623 --> 02:29:26.044]  Hammering!
[02:29:26.404 --> 02:29:28.005]  Stop the hammering!
[02:29:31.127 --> 02:29:32.448]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[02:29:32.468 --> 02:29:34.090]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:35.711]  Stop the hammering!
[02:29:36.011 --> 02:29:37.032]  Hammering, hammering.
[02:29:37.813 --> 02:29:42.076]  And all these fools, and all these traitors don't get it.
[02:29:42.637 --> 02:29:49.042]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[02:29:49.643 --> 02:29:51.665]  It just f***ing sucks.
[02:29:52.005 --> 02:29:56.268]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[02:29:56.949 --> 02:29:57.809]  Control the churches.
[02:29:58.029 --> 02:29:59.030]  Control the food you eat.
[02:29:59.230 --> 02:30:00.770]  Control the vaccines they put in your body.
[02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.850]  Control the internet.
[02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.871]  Control everything.
[02:30:02.911 --> 02:30:03.271]  They're here.
[02:30:03.771 --> 02:30:06.672]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[02:30:06.732 --> 02:30:07.472]  That's what I know.
[02:30:08.132 --> 02:30:11.213]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.

[02:30:17.494 --> 02:30:18.415]  Standing with America.
[02:30:18.435 --> 02:30:20.435]  Standing against the Chi-Coms in Hollywood.
[02:30:20.655 --> 02:30:22.075]  Standing for victory and winning.
[02:30:22.256 --> 02:30:22.816]  Thanks to you.
[02:30:22.896 --> 02:30:23.376]  We'll be back.
[02:30:24.236 --> 02:30:27.317]  I'll go down to the g***** floor myself and stop it.
[02:30:27.357 --> 02:30:29.138]  Keep the g***** commercial break going.

[02:31:07.122 --> 02:31:10.624]  The man, the truth, the resistance, Alex Jones.
[02:31:10.905 --> 02:31:13.446]  I am a Hispanic Trump supporter slash InfoWarrior.
[02:31:13.466 --> 02:31:16.028]  I have a couple points to make, but I want to plug for you real quick.
[02:31:16.088 --> 02:31:19.090]  Survival Shield, Mason Iodine X2, life-changing.
[02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:21.052]  SuperMill Vitality, life-changing.
[02:31:21.092 --> 02:31:22.733]  Brain Force Plus, life-changing.
[02:31:22.793 --> 02:31:25.114]  Super Blue Non-Fluoride Toothpaste, life-changing.
[02:31:25.154 --> 02:31:26.615]  I'm sure the rest of them are good products.
[02:31:26.635 --> 02:31:28.597]  I haven't been able to try them all yet, but they're awesome.
[02:31:28.637 --> 02:31:30.298]  The hats, t-shirts, amazing.
[02:31:30.498 --> 02:31:32.320]  Briefly, tell us what the supplements did for you.
[02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:33.562]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[02:31:33.602 --> 02:31:35.344]  Just like you, I'm about the same body type.
[02:31:35.424 --> 02:31:37.106]  I'm short, stocky, strong guy.
[02:31:37.126 --> 02:31:38.908]  I'm Puerto Rican, Italian, and Cuban.
[02:31:38.968 --> 02:31:40.389]  Hispanic, strong supporter, like I said.
[02:31:40.489 --> 02:31:42.612]  And I started working out every day.
[02:31:42.752 --> 02:31:44.134]  I lift weights every day.
[02:31:44.294 --> 02:31:45.415]  I don't even have to take the
[02:31:46.035 --> 02:31:47.495]  I'm taking the Survival Shield X2.
[02:31:47.616 --> 02:31:48.896]  I drop that every morning.
[02:31:48.936 --> 02:31:49.936]  I feel fantastic.
[02:31:49.976 --> 02:31:50.936]  My skin is clearing up.
[02:31:50.956 --> 02:31:51.596]  I have psoriasis.
[02:31:51.616 --> 02:31:52.637]  So that's clearing up.
[02:31:52.677 --> 02:31:53.917]  My hair is going back thicker.
[02:31:53.937 --> 02:31:57.198]  I'm losing some of it, but it's growing back thicker in the areas that I do have it.
[02:31:57.238 --> 02:31:59.178]  The brain force is just amazing.
[02:31:59.258 --> 02:32:00.499]  That stuff makes you think.
[02:32:00.639 --> 02:32:01.759]  It keeps you on your toes.
[02:32:01.779 --> 02:32:02.999]  The same thing with the iodine.
[02:32:03.019 --> 02:32:05.340]  It just brings this clarity and this focus.
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:06.740]  And your products are amazing.
[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:09.141]  It's like a cleansing for the brain when we listen to you.
[02:32:09.521 --> 02:32:11.261]  And it's just life changing.
[02:32:11.321 --> 02:32:14.522]  And how people can go against the true resistance, they're going to learn soon.
[02:32:14.702 --> 02:32:17.266]  That they're on the wrong side of history and that's why we're the right.
[02:32:17.446 --> 02:32:18.948]  We're not the alt-right, we're just right.
[02:32:18.988 --> 02:32:22.573]  And I've got to say, I started Titans of Liberty's Truth Wars because of you, Alex.
[02:32:22.613 --> 02:32:24.175]  You are a big inspiration to me.
[02:32:24.195 --> 02:32:24.876]  You're the real deal.
[02:32:25.156 --> 02:32:27.920]  If anybody's listening right now, Alex Jones is the real deal.
[02:32:33.183 --> 02:32:34.064]  Hey, have you heard?
[02:32:34.084 --> 02:32:36.625]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[02:32:36.705 --> 02:32:37.986]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:32:38.186 --> 02:32:39.207]  They're all censoring us.
[02:32:39.587 --> 02:32:45.471]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[02:32:45.791 --> 02:32:48.813]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[02:33:03.453 --> 02:33:06.176]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.887 --> 02:33:16.789]  Your powers are weak, old man.
[02:33:18.602 --> 02:33:21.584]  Soon the SJWs will rule the galaxy.
[02:33:21.604 --> 02:33:22.264]  Big Brother.
[02:33:22.745 --> 02:33:23.665]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:23.685 --> 02:33:25.026]  Government powers.
[02:33:25.166 --> 02:33:26.407]  Allies with Islam.
[02:33:26.447 --> 02:33:27.888]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:28.128 --> 02:33:29.048]  Well so it is.
[02:33:29.068 --> 02:33:31.190]  Women's journey to the dark side of the conflict.
[02:33:31.210 --> 02:33:34.492]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.295 --> 02:33:39.879]  Diane, there is a proposal to remove Trump's star from the Walk of Fame.
[02:33:39.919 --> 02:33:40.900]  Come on.
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:41.880]  It's a great idea.
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:44.363]  I wanted to ask you... I think someone should take a s*** on it.
[02:33:45.304 --> 02:33:47.826]  Well, that's the whole problem is people are vandalizing it so much.
[02:33:47.846 --> 02:33:48.467]  That's great.
[02:33:48.727 --> 02:33:49.868]  Make a toilet out of it.
[02:33:50.028 --> 02:33:50.348]  Come on.
[02:33:50.368 --> 02:33:54.372]  They're citing disturbing use of... Well, the good news is it's been removed.
[02:33:54.392 --> 02:33:55.734]  You censors got what you wanted.
[02:33:55.754 --> 02:33:59.177]  It's like they want to change the name of Austin because they say it's racist.
[02:34:02.213 --> 02:34:11.620]  The question that's been posed is, if they're going to remove Trump's star for his disturbing treatment of women, should they remove people like Kevin Spacey and Bill Cosby's stars as well?
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:12.620]  Oh God, I don't know.
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:13.101]  I don't know.
[02:34:13.221 --> 02:34:17.684]  But I think right now, we should just, you know, Trump, make it a toilet.
[02:34:19.185 --> 02:34:20.306]  Just put a toilet there?
[02:34:20.626 --> 02:34:22.247]  Put one on top of it, actually.
[02:34:22.367 --> 02:34:24.569]  I mean, no one wants to, you know, take his s*** off.
[02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:26.550]  Oh my God, what am I saying?
[02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:27.251]  Oh God, okay.
[02:34:27.271 --> 02:34:28.111]  Thanks, bye.
[02:34:28.191 --> 02:34:29.032]  Alright, thank you.
[02:34:30.552 --> 02:34:35.655]  And we are back with Owen Benjamin, band comedian, been one of the, you know, very successful comedian out there in the U.S.
[02:34:35.695 --> 02:34:55.104]  Go over the time frame of this and then contemporarily other points you want to make about experiencing this, seeing others experience it, and the way they've organized the colleges and the big tech companies into these engines of tyranny and now Google and now Apple are moving to China and saying they're going to censor us here and China threatens to hold Apple
[02:34:55.604 --> 02:35:00.187]  Hostage, if Trump tries something, I mean, my God, we really have been sold out.
[02:35:00.327 --> 02:35:05.570]  Why are these people brought up to hate America so much when they can get more opportunity here than ever?
[02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:11.454]  And if they just dialed into their own Americanism, they would experience and discover their own greatness.
[02:35:12.659 --> 02:35:14.580]  Yeah man, it's pretty wild.
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:19.921]  So the timeline for me was, I say that about the trans children, that it's child abuse.
[02:35:20.522 --> 02:35:25.743]  I immediately lose, this is last October, I immediately lose my agent at CA and then my manager.
[02:35:25.763 --> 02:35:33.966]  And then UConn, where I was getting paid $7,500 to do an hour show and I had a bunch lined up of those.
[02:35:34.526 --> 02:35:36.888]  And they all just cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.
[02:35:36.908 --> 02:35:39.750]  And they sent me a letter saying why.
[02:35:39.790 --> 02:35:41.211]  It's because I'm transphobic.
[02:35:41.251 --> 02:35:43.793]  So I did the unthinkable and I tweeted it.
[02:35:44.514 --> 02:35:52.560]  And I showed everyone exactly what was going on because the way that these people operate is they slowly normalize these awful things.
[02:35:53.181 --> 02:35:58.465]  And so when you're a canary in the coal mine, when you're ahead of the curve a little bit, you can say this is what their goal is.
[02:35:58.565 --> 02:35:59.786]  Look at this email.
[02:36:00.552 --> 02:36:07.059]  And then all hell broke loose, you know, and then I was also doing a Steven Crowder show, which was a big no-no for Hollywood.
[02:36:07.699 --> 02:36:11.904]  And then just to see everyone turn on me like people that I've been friends with for 15 years.
[02:36:13.265 --> 02:36:14.927]  And it was it was pretty remarkable.
[02:36:14.947 --> 02:36:17.730]  But here's the thing is I don't think America is in the same.
[02:36:19.403 --> 02:36:25.884]  Vote as Europe and some of these other places in Canada, because I think we just have more of that individualism.
[02:36:25.904 --> 02:36:26.665]  No, no, I agree.
[02:36:26.685 --> 02:36:31.786]  The ghost of America is strong here, and if we reignited it, it can come back to life like a phoenix.
[02:36:31.806 --> 02:36:32.406]  Think about it.
[02:36:32.426 --> 02:36:36.507]  Humans die, but spirits and ideas and things can come back.
[02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:41.568]  And I think they're panicking because they can see and feel it coming back even stronger than it was.
[02:36:42.665 --> 02:36:48.800]  Oh yeah, because all you have to do is understand that there is no amount of money that is worth that existence.
[02:36:51.674 --> 02:37:01.098]  These feelings of how there really is truth and there's power, and there's people that are going for power and there's people that are going for truth, and you don't really know what you are unless you're tested in those moments.
[02:37:01.919 --> 02:37:03.079]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:37:03.099 --> 02:37:09.402]  Did you not feel, because you were never obviously looking for power, you wanted truth, but you were just trying to have fun, obviously, or get your ideas out and have fun.
[02:37:09.422 --> 02:37:11.543]  Don't let me speak for you, but that's how I am.
[02:37:11.823 --> 02:37:14.484]  But once they showed you the two different choices, it made it clear
[02:37:14.984 --> 02:37:18.386]  And you're more fulfilled now that you chose the truth, then you learn the trick.
[02:37:18.606 --> 02:37:20.487]  Oh, then all the power is actually there.
[02:37:20.747 --> 02:37:23.769]  You were never looking for the power, but once you go with truth, that's where the power is.
[02:37:24.568 --> 02:37:27.069]  Oh yeah, and you can see it in like a Jimmy Kimmel.
[02:37:27.089 --> 02:37:34.751]  Like a Jimmy Kimmel makes more than I'll make in a lifetime in a year, and yet he has to do the bidding of these people.
[02:37:34.811 --> 02:37:38.072]  You know, he's out there crying because a lion got shot by a lion hunter.
[02:37:38.572 --> 02:37:40.692]  You know, it's just like, they're not free.
[02:37:41.053 --> 02:37:46.234]  And what they believe, because money is a great currency, but money is just a currency of freedom.
[02:37:46.849 --> 02:37:48.931]  And if you don't see it that way, you're done.
[02:37:48.971 --> 02:37:51.792]  If you see money as the end game, it's over for you.
[02:37:51.873 --> 02:37:58.217]  But if you see it as almost like a way to put time in a physical form... It's only fuel.
[02:37:58.297 --> 02:38:00.218]  It's only fuel to be able to do what you want.
[02:38:00.398 --> 02:38:00.699]  Yeah.
[02:38:01.199 --> 02:38:05.742]  Yeah, and then social approval was more of my weakness than money.
[02:38:05.842 --> 02:38:15.149]  Like, it hurt a lot to have people that, these more powerful, more respected people... But doesn't it hurt that you now know they're pieces of empty crap?
[02:38:15.916 --> 02:38:19.821]  Yeah, no, it was almost like mourning the death of someone.
[02:38:19.881 --> 02:38:23.645]  It hurt, but it had to be done because of what they were doing.
[02:38:23.665 --> 02:38:31.134]  And it's one thing if people want to play games and play nonsense games with adults, but once it started going towards children, and that clip you just showed about the Trump star,
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:40.785]  How the Kevin Spacey star would never have been attacked because they have no problem with putting children in harm's way, but yet Trump, they attack.
[02:38:40.845 --> 02:38:46.349]  And it really shows the values of these people and how France, I'm pretty sure they just got rid of the age of consent laws.
[02:38:46.949 --> 02:38:57.015]  And I think that's one of these really evil unions that seems to be happening is the Islamists and the leftists seem to be on a team now because they both are pretty okay with child brides.
[02:38:57.817 --> 02:39:06.624]  And, uh, I, like, like, my tweet that got me banned from Twitter forever, permanently, was I said, David Hogg doesn't even have pubes yet.
[02:39:06.664 --> 02:39:08.245]  He can't tell me not to own an AR-15.
[02:39:08.465 --> 02:39:09.566]  That's all I said.
[02:39:10.046 --> 02:39:13.288]  And people made it out like I was sexualizing a child.
[02:39:13.889 --> 02:39:15.690]  And it was so obviously not.
[02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:16.471]  And then you have James Gunn.
[02:39:16.491 --> 02:39:19.233]  No, you're saying he's not even a teenager in manhood yet.
[02:39:19.653 --> 02:39:20.334]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:39:21.215 --> 02:39:25.218]  He makes himself a public figure, he calls me a piece of garbage and all these names.
[02:39:25.238 --> 02:39:30.922]  YouTube tried to ban me the first time, saying I bullied him but wouldn't show the video, which I didn't bully him.
[02:39:31.182 --> 02:39:36.886]  So exactly, they use him as puppets, then they hold them up and say we can't even criticize them when they're attacking us.
[02:39:37.386 --> 02:39:37.866]  Exactly!
[02:39:38.427 --> 02:39:40.208]  They're using him as shields.
[02:39:40.228 --> 02:39:42.309]  Is this Hogg?
[02:39:45.231 --> 02:39:47.473]  Let me ask you this question, I know somebody's talking to you in your house.
[02:39:48.618 --> 02:39:50.139]  Notice you don't hear about David Hogg anymore.
[02:39:50.199 --> 02:39:51.420]  He went over like a lead balloon.
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:53.822]  There's like a tone deafness to the establishment.
[02:39:54.062 --> 02:39:55.143]  They don't get what we want.
[02:39:56.204 --> 02:39:58.065]  Well that's why I keep bringing up these things.
[02:39:58.085 --> 02:40:00.988]  Like sometimes people are like, why do you keep bringing up David Hogg?
[02:40:01.028 --> 02:40:01.708]  Just let that thing go.
[02:40:01.768 --> 02:40:04.250]  I'm like, I want people to remember that happens.
[02:40:04.470 --> 02:40:07.653]  Because the way mainstream media operates... They have short attention span.
[02:40:07.673 --> 02:40:08.373]  They count on that.
[02:40:08.754 --> 02:40:09.815]  In fact, Rubber said that.
[02:40:09.835 --> 02:40:11.396]  They said... Yeah, go ahead.
[02:40:12.341 --> 02:40:13.181]  No, yeah, exactly.
[02:40:13.201 --> 02:40:14.922]  They count on the fact we're goldfish.
[02:40:14.962 --> 02:40:16.022]  Like, no way, a castle.
[02:40:16.302 --> 02:40:17.163]  Three second memory.
[02:40:17.243 --> 02:40:18.163]  No way, a castle.
[02:40:18.623 --> 02:40:21.184]  Like, they need us to forget about Hogg.
[02:40:21.224 --> 02:40:25.906]  And Hogg was trying, like, they tried to use Hogg as a way to take away our right to bear arms.
[02:40:26.026 --> 02:40:26.906]  I pointed that out.
[02:40:27.286 --> 02:40:29.767]  And then they tried to use that to ban me.
[02:40:29.907 --> 02:40:31.628]  And now it's falling apart.
[02:40:31.668 --> 02:40:37.590]  When people show what it was that I was banned for, and then put that next to James Gunn, who's advocating sex with children.
[02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:40.313]  Like, actually, it's a joke.
[02:40:41.014 --> 02:40:44.499]  And to watch the malaise of people, just the dead eyes of...
[02:40:45.143 --> 02:40:47.405]  Video games and corn syrup and pornography.
[02:40:47.445 --> 02:40:48.645]  I'm just like, wake up!
[02:41:15.904 --> 02:41:17.966]  Yeah, I think they got him addicted to cortisol.
[02:41:18.006 --> 02:41:26.755]  It's almost like people that, I've had close friends that have been addicted to gambling, and you become, you don't become addicted to winning, you actually become addicted to losing, which is really dangerous.
[02:41:27.376 --> 02:41:33.002]  And so these people, unless they're in a constant state of panic and chaos, they don't know what to do with themselves.
[02:41:33.062 --> 02:41:37.567]  And it really is a fundamental, almost medical problem at this point, because
[02:41:38.314 --> 02:41:40.436]  The left wasn't this ferocious.
[02:41:40.477 --> 02:41:53.411]  You had the, you know, I have friends, some Christian conservative friends that I used to think were being crazy, and now I've apologized to them and admitted that they were right at foreseeing a lot of these horrifying things that have come.
[02:41:54.432 --> 02:41:55.774]  The left is now... Oh, exactly.
[02:41:55.834 --> 02:41:57.816]  Super right-wing Christians told me stuff 30 years ago.
[02:41:57.836 --> 02:41:58.557]  I thought they were nuts.
[02:41:58.637 --> 02:41:59.217]  It all came true.
[02:41:59.237 --> 02:41:59.458]  Me too!
[02:42:00.802 --> 02:42:13.193]  Like my boy Steven Crowder and a couple other of my friends were saying, you know, I was all about gay marriage because of the freedom aspect, that I don't want anyone to not have the freedom that I have is my fundamental American mindset.
[02:42:13.734 --> 02:42:15.796]  And people would say, oh, they're going to go after the kids, man.
[02:42:15.816 --> 02:42:16.977]  They're going to take away gender.
[02:42:16.997 --> 02:42:18.238]  They're going to make men and women.
[02:42:18.258 --> 02:42:19.919]  And I'm like, you guys are crazy.
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:22.781]  They didn't even celebrate gay marriage.
[02:42:22.841 --> 02:42:25.401]  They immediately just started going after the next thing.
[02:42:25.441 --> 02:42:27.082]  And, you know, Caitlin's Woman of the Year.
[02:42:27.102 --> 02:42:28.902]  And now there's no Mother's Day and Father's Day.
[02:42:28.942 --> 02:42:33.483]  And I just saw that it was a destructive force.
[02:42:33.623 --> 02:42:38.124]  You know, I think the right more builds the house and the left more destroys the house.
[02:42:38.144 --> 02:42:38.484]  You're right.
[02:42:38.504 --> 02:42:41.005]  They want to destroy it because they see it as conquering it.
[02:42:41.285 --> 02:42:43.825]  They're not even fundamentally smart enough to, like, take it over.
[02:42:44.566 --> 02:42:45.566]  Like, oh, this really works.
[02:42:45.606 --> 02:42:46.366]  Let's run this.
[02:42:46.746 --> 02:42:47.706]  Let's be better at this.
[02:42:47.746 --> 02:42:48.267]  They go, no.
[02:42:48.867 --> 02:42:50.187]  We will fundamentally destroy it.
[02:42:50.942 --> 02:42:53.085]  Yeah, we have to save them from themselves in a lot of ways.
[02:42:53.105 --> 02:42:58.511]  Because if you read the Gulag Archipelago, you see that its wave of leftists eats the previous wave of leftists.
[02:42:58.531 --> 02:43:00.313]  Let's talk about Frank in North Carolina.
[02:43:00.333 --> 02:43:01.314]  Thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:01.435 --> 02:43:01.775]  Go ahead.
[02:43:02.035 --> 02:43:04.218]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:04.238 --> 02:43:07.302]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:08.115 --> 02:43:09.216]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:09.536 --> 02:43:11.258]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:11.959 --> 02:43:14.041]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:14.281 --> 02:43:18.325]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:18.345 --> 02:43:20.787]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:21.608 --> 02:43:23.930]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:24.290 --> 02:43:25.391]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:25.652 --> 02:43:26.533]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:26.773 --> 02:43:27.794]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:28.234 --> 02:43:29.275]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:29.315 --> 02:43:30.395]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:43:30.415 --> 02:43:31.235]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:31.496 --> 02:43:36.858]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:37.178 --> 02:43:41.460]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:44.561]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:44.821 --> 02:43:45.202]  You understand?
[02:43:45.302 --> 02:43:46.582]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:46.922 --> 02:43:48.103]  I need your help, Frank!

[02:44:03.567 --> 02:44:08.710]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.

[02:45:00.615 --> 02:45:18.904]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:45:19.005 --> 02:45:24.587]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:45:25.288 --> 02:45:25.968]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:45:26.088 --> 02:45:29.250]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:45:29.890 --> 02:45:30.870]  And so much more.
[02:45:31.430 --> 02:45:32.551]  It is concentrated.
[02:45:32.791 --> 02:45:34.491]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:45:34.511 --> 02:45:40.213]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:45:40.313 --> 02:45:41.513]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:45:41.533 --> 02:45:43.474]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:45:43.554 --> 02:45:45.934]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:45:46.134 --> 02:45:47.395]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:45:47.575 --> 02:45:49.375]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:45:49.935 --> 02:45:50.535]  Immune Wall.
[02:45:50.655 --> 02:45:51.956]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:52.096 --> 02:45:53.256]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:03.243 --> 02:46:06.344]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:46:06.384 --> 02:46:06.904]  You're on the air.
[02:46:06.924 --> 02:46:08.065]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:08.105 --> 02:46:08.945]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:46:09.145 --> 02:46:09.765]  Hey, brother.
[02:46:10.045 --> 02:46:10.425]  Good, man.
[02:46:10.445 --> 02:46:11.246]  Thank you for calling.
[02:46:11.326 --> 02:46:11.886]  Hey, hey.
[02:46:11.986 --> 02:46:16.387]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:46:16.607 --> 02:46:22.989]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:46:23.109 --> 02:46:24.810]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:46:24.890 --> 02:46:31.692]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:46:31.852 --> 02:46:33.332]  Well, that's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:46:33.392 --> 02:46:37.413]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy, and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:46:37.794 --> 02:46:39.474]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:46:39.834 --> 02:46:40.574]  And exactly.
[02:46:40.594 --> 02:46:44.956]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:46:45.196 --> 02:46:45.456]  Boom!
[02:46:45.596 --> 02:46:48.436]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:46:48.476 --> 02:46:49.017]  It's amazing.
[02:46:49.077 --> 02:46:53.318]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up, and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:47:03.465 --> 02:47:07.649]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.497 --> 02:47:22.122]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:47:22.583 --> 02:47:23.083]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:47:23.944 --> 02:47:25.005]  Infowars.com, yeah.
[02:47:31.075 --> 02:47:37.378]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:38.818 --> 02:47:44.960]  You know, the way the mainstream corporate media has acted, it's like, oh, Sean Hannity stuck up for Alex Jones.
[02:47:45.661 --> 02:47:46.401]  Wow, what a kook.
[02:47:46.441 --> 02:47:47.701]  How horrible for First Amendment.
[02:47:48.141 --> 02:47:49.102]  And Jack Dorsey did.
[02:47:50.854 --> 02:47:55.977]  Jack Dorsey's under heat because Trump came out and said shadow banning is criminal.
[02:47:55.997 --> 02:47:56.657]  We're looking into it.
[02:47:56.697 --> 02:47:58.238]  So now he's trying to back off.
[02:47:58.278 --> 02:47:59.819]  He's been the vanguard of the censorship.
[02:47:59.839 --> 02:48:01.660]  They're not trying to fight with Jack Dorsey.
[02:48:02.541 --> 02:48:10.325]  I'd like to be on all these platforms and reach people, but I look at the sickening headlines where they're just foaming at the mouth to take me off air.
[02:48:10.946 --> 02:48:12.947]  They never actually show a clip of what I've said.
[02:48:14.748 --> 02:48:16.689]  They just go, Jones, you don't have free speech.
[02:48:16.709 --> 02:48:17.890]  But I want to show people something.
[02:48:18.666 --> 02:48:19.767]  That are TV viewers.
[02:48:20.387 --> 02:48:25.490]  If you go to Google and type in Alex Jones, it says, free speech scholars Alex Jones, you are not protected.
[02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:27.311]  Well, I got it.
[02:48:27.792 --> 02:48:28.652]  I'm not protected.
[02:48:29.132 --> 02:48:31.094]  And I went, wait, I saw that article like a week ago.
[02:48:31.874 --> 02:48:33.675]  And sure enough, they published it a week ago.
[02:48:34.056 --> 02:48:35.116]  They republished it again.
[02:48:35.516 --> 02:48:39.739]  They're gaming Google so bad that Google puts their stories out every day like they're new.
[02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:44.122]  You just see how the tech giants with the New York Times are like,
[02:48:45.282 --> 02:48:50.645]  Suppressing everybody else and then force-feeding the New York Times saying take Alex Jones off the air.
[02:48:51.145 --> 02:48:53.787]  And then 78% say don't censor him at all.
[02:48:54.567 --> 02:48:56.828]  Another 14% say we're not sure.
[02:48:56.848 --> 02:48:59.030]  8% says censor me.
[02:48:59.330 --> 02:49:00.210]  And they don't care though.
[02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:01.411]  They're still pushing him.
[02:49:01.971 --> 02:49:05.173]  Owen Benjamin, a popular comedian that's been blackballed by these folks.
[02:49:05.533 --> 02:49:06.794]  You say it's made you stronger.
[02:49:07.294 --> 02:49:10.416]  Where do you see this long-term going?
[02:49:11.971 --> 02:49:20.738]  Where do you see this going as big tech merges with China, but because they're Asian, it's okay to kill Christians and conservatives and Buddhists.
[02:49:21.098 --> 02:49:24.020]  I mean, it's like the left are like a group of monsters.
[02:49:25.941 --> 02:49:27.042]  I don't know.
[02:49:27.062 --> 02:49:32.226]  I can't make a prediction as far as our currency or international relations or stuff.
[02:49:32.286 --> 02:49:38.211]  It's just culturally is where I kind of am a bit of an expert, so I can maybe make a prediction there.
[02:49:39.289 --> 02:49:47.036]  That it'll just continue to divide people until you have almost two just completely different nations existing within America.
[02:49:47.256 --> 02:49:55.484]  One that hates America, does not want any border security, is ironic in every single thing they say.
[02:49:58.327 --> 02:50:03.091]  Kanye West says that black people don't have to vote Democrat and they call him a racist for that.
[02:50:03.171 --> 02:50:04.913]  Like, just mind-blowing ironies.
[02:50:05.453 --> 02:50:11.659]  And then you'll have people like us from a variety of backgrounds that just see the world more as individuals.
[02:50:11.779 --> 02:50:18.845]  And business is beautiful for people like us because in the real world, merit
[02:50:19.645 --> 02:50:21.485]  I'll look at headlines like the Washington Post.
[02:50:50.131 --> 02:50:54.434]  Giving their losers, who are losing the primaries, losing everything, simulated victories.
[02:50:54.975 --> 02:51:01.459]  Alex Jones loses his empire, but not for the reason you'd think.
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:07.744]  As the poem goes, you know, said Senator Ted Cruz, first they came for Alex Jones.
[02:51:10.997 --> 02:51:12.279]  It's only going to make you stronger.
[02:51:12.339 --> 02:51:13.580]  I mean, that's the irony.
[02:51:13.881 --> 02:51:18.586]  Well, if our listeners stay vigilant and aware and have a memory, like you said they will.
[02:51:18.646 --> 02:51:20.749]  Right now, we're reaching a lot of new people.
[02:51:21.530 --> 02:51:23.890]  But it's not about us.
[02:51:24.191 --> 02:51:38.474]  The fact that they can set a precedent to de-platform us and take our commenting service away and take our email service away and they're trying to take our DNS and I mean right now they're trying, I should have been on air beginning the show, like they're trying to take our DNS, our servers, they're trying to kick us off air.
[02:51:38.794 --> 02:51:43.675]  So this argument of oh it's a private company, it's like saying oh you can't have phone service because you're Jewish in Nazi Germany.
[02:51:43.695 --> 02:51:45.055]  I mean they're making their move right now.
[02:51:46.107 --> 02:51:53.016]  Yeah, it is an information monopoly too, so it doesn't have the same bake-the-cake type argument.
[02:51:53.256 --> 02:52:00.745]  They have such a massive monopoly that it isn't right what they're doing to you at all, but one thing it does do
[02:52:01.466 --> 02:52:06.831]  It has people research you more and see that you're not saying the things that they claim.
[02:52:06.871 --> 02:52:07.831]  That's what happened to me.
[02:52:08.012 --> 02:52:15.318]  I know that that only increased my reach, was they would say that I was a racist and then they could not find anything racist.
[02:52:15.358 --> 02:52:20.282]  Well, it's the same thing where they say, he peddles this info and says this and then never linked to it.
[02:52:21.036 --> 02:52:23.137]  And they're the high priest, like you said though.
[02:52:23.498 --> 02:52:25.499]  We're going to decide what you can see, okay?
[02:52:25.639 --> 02:52:26.280]  We're in charge.
[02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:30.542]  Like, imagine if you were even a teenager and people go, I'm in charge of what you can see.
[02:52:30.622 --> 02:52:34.105]  Famously, Como on CNN goes, you can't look at WikiLeaks.
[02:52:34.285 --> 02:52:34.905]  I'm allowed to.
[02:52:34.925 --> 02:52:35.926]  If you do, you'll be arrested.
[02:52:36.566 --> 02:52:37.527]  People are like, what?
[02:52:38.508 --> 02:52:43.011]  It's the sale of indulgences, what Martin Luther originally rebelled against back in the day.
[02:52:43.051 --> 02:52:48.415]  You have this institutional corruption that makes it so some people can say certain things and some people can't.
[02:52:48.876 --> 02:52:52.338]  And the people in America are just not buying it.
[02:52:52.358 --> 02:52:59.343]  They've successfully made the word racist and Nazi and all this stuff meaningless terms.
[02:52:59.403 --> 02:53:01.625]  So now when someone's called a racist or a Nazi,
[02:53:02.645 --> 02:53:07.007]  I don't even flinch because I assume that it's just someone who's won against the narrative.
[02:53:07.187 --> 02:53:14.609]  Because, you know, once they start calling Jewish people Nazis and black people like Candace Owens racist, they've jumped the ship.
[02:53:14.769 --> 02:53:15.870]  You know, they've jumped the shark.
[02:53:16.370 --> 02:53:17.871]  And at this point, no one's buying it.
[02:53:17.891 --> 02:53:21.592]  CNN, I mean, people are chanting CNN sucks.
[02:53:22.152 --> 02:53:23.573]  And they act like the victim.
[02:53:23.633 --> 02:53:24.894]  They're trying to play victim.
[02:53:24.934 --> 02:53:28.216]  Oh, they say, oh, Trump's going to attack us, but they're the one to take this speech.
[02:53:28.256 --> 02:53:32.219]  And Alex Jones says the ADL comes out in defense of banning Alex Jones.
[02:53:32.259 --> 02:53:39.324]  Then it says his conspiracy theories are serious, but there's no Russian collusion.
[02:53:39.584 --> 02:53:43.187]  But one would have thought that this open appeal to bigotry.
[02:53:45.051 --> 02:53:46.092]  They don't even show what I'm saying.
[02:53:46.652 --> 02:53:49.254]  And frequent anti-semitic dog whistles.
[02:53:49.614 --> 02:53:52.536]  So notice, no links in the New York Times, like we would do in our article.
[02:53:52.797 --> 02:53:55.538]  Like if I said somebody said something anti-semitic, I would link to it.
[02:53:55.999 --> 02:53:59.281]  I don't agree with being anti-semitic, you have a right to say it, but they don't show it.
[02:54:00.402 --> 02:54:12.751]  His conspiracy theories are serious, but one would have thought that his open appeals to bigotry and frequent anti-semitism dog whistles would have merited his removal from social media and podcasting platforms long ago.
[02:54:14.417 --> 02:54:21.719]  So because it's the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, I mean, that'd be like if I said, the guy that wrote this is a Nazi.
[02:54:22.159 --> 02:54:22.799]  Well, he'd sue me.
[02:54:22.839 --> 02:54:23.679]  I'm not saying he is one.
[02:54:24.039 --> 02:54:27.780]  He says it about me because it's okay, because he says it in the New York Times.
[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:34.622]  I had a New York Times writer here, and I said, yeah, when I tried to get into the inauguration, they had people blocking the entrances, beating people up.
[02:54:35.922 --> 02:54:36.942]  She goes, that's not true, I was there.
[02:54:36.962 --> 02:54:40.143]  And she goes, of course, she knew full well it was all over the news it happened.
[02:54:40.263 --> 02:54:41.123]  I'm sure she agreed with it.
[02:54:41.503 --> 02:54:43.884]  And I said, after I learned that, I said, I'm not talking to you anymore.
[02:54:44.451 --> 02:54:45.771]  I said, I'm never talking to you again.
[02:54:45.791 --> 02:54:46.852]  Because I already knew.
[02:54:46.892 --> 02:54:47.792]  I never talked to him anyways.
[02:54:47.812 --> 02:54:48.732]  I did it as a test case.
[02:54:49.252 --> 02:54:50.553]  They know it's not true.
[02:54:50.593 --> 02:54:57.015]  They play this weird mind game of gaslighting where they want you to feel alone and weird, like their will.
[02:54:57.095 --> 02:54:59.796]  Like, you know, Islam is not oppressive.
[02:54:59.816 --> 02:55:00.776]  We do not wear burqas.
[02:55:00.816 --> 02:55:02.096]  We do not sexually mutilate women.
[02:55:02.356 --> 02:55:03.457]  Hillary won the election.
[02:55:03.817 --> 02:55:08.958]  And it's this weird, you know, mind control thing of like, no one blocked anyone at the inauguration.
[02:55:09.299 --> 02:55:10.539]  No one came to see Trump.
[02:55:10.879 --> 02:55:15.701]  And I search engine it, and there were even Washington Post, New York Times saying they blocked people, they beat them up.
[02:55:15.841 --> 02:55:21.223]  I was there, but they just attacked us and said it wasn't the case.
[02:55:22.463 --> 02:55:28.766]  Yeah, it's almost like trust is one of the most important things you can have, especially with a media outlet.
[02:55:29.186 --> 02:55:32.927]  And my slogan was always, I might be wrong, but I'm not lying.
[02:55:33.368 --> 02:55:34.828]  No, I know, but let me ask you that question.
[02:55:35.168 --> 02:55:36.909]  What is this weird thing on the left where they'll go,
[02:55:38.953 --> 02:55:41.256]  They'll like say something that's true and admit it isn't true.
[02:55:41.276 --> 02:55:44.461]  They'll look at you and smile and go, is he trying to manipulate you or is it?
[02:55:44.481 --> 02:55:45.602]  It's compliance training.
[02:55:45.742 --> 02:55:47.124]  It's just like how you train a dog.
[02:55:47.725 --> 02:55:50.649]  We say, you know, Caitlyn Jenner is the greatest woman in the world.
[02:55:50.709 --> 02:55:51.831]  Caitlyn, just say it.
[02:55:51.951 --> 02:55:54.214]  It's a purity test for a cult.
[02:55:54.815 --> 02:55:57.238]  Where if you admit to nonsense, they know they own you.
[02:55:57.298 --> 02:55:58.559]  It's how you train animals.
[02:55:58.700 --> 02:55:59.541]  There's no difference.
[02:55:59.581 --> 02:56:04.386]  So, if someone says, you know, Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[02:56:04.406 --> 02:56:05.347]  Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[02:56:05.387 --> 02:56:05.748]  Admit it.
[02:56:06.188 --> 02:56:08.671]  They're not asking you if you believe Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[02:56:08.731 --> 02:56:09.733]  Everyone knows he's not.
[02:56:09.773 --> 02:56:11.414]  They're just wanting you to submit.
[02:56:11.535 --> 02:56:14.818]  Because they've submitted and that's the power they have.
[02:56:15.535 --> 02:56:16.016]  Exactly.
[02:56:16.056 --> 02:56:20.004]  They want to be able to know that whatever they tell you, you'll agree with.
[02:56:20.184 --> 02:56:22.489]  And that's the leftist mentality.
[02:56:28.231 --> 02:56:47.726]  Oh, it's always a losing mentality, because I was talking to one of my buddies about this recently, where I was like, one thing I love about you is when I bring up a point that you realize is a better point than what you previously believed, you look happy, you look excited, like, thank you for sharpening my sword, whereas a leftist would look threatened and then call you a bigot.
[02:56:48.206 --> 02:56:53.310]  So, fundamentally, they're only dulling their own weapons, they're only... Oh, all the time I admit I'm wrong.
[02:56:53.330 --> 02:56:54.711]  I'm always trying to, like, learn new stuff.
[02:56:54.731 --> 02:56:55.192]  Yeah, totally.
[02:56:55.812 --> 02:56:58.514]  And you bat a higher percentage than any of these mainstream guys.
[02:56:58.574 --> 02:56:59.614]  I was telling that to Harrison.
[02:57:00.395 --> 02:57:01.475]  I'm buddies with Harrison.
[02:57:01.535 --> 02:57:13.542]  I was telling him, if you go back in time, if you go six months, a year, in a lot of your shows, that's probably one reason why they wanted to wipe the slate, is you're more accurate than they want to admit.
[02:57:13.803 --> 02:57:21.907]  And at first, sometimes you hear things and they sound jarring, and then you see time play out and you're like, wow, it really did go to China, huh?
[02:57:22.147 --> 02:57:22.828]  That's wild.
[02:57:23.578 --> 02:57:25.259]  Let's do five more minutes and talk about that.
[02:57:25.319 --> 02:57:29.962]  No, 35,000 videos, 2.5 billion views, 2.5 million subscribers.
[02:57:30.422 --> 02:57:32.864]  Like, to use the Star Wars analogy, like Alderaan.
[02:57:33.304 --> 02:57:34.685]  Blown into bits.
[02:57:35.345 --> 02:57:35.886]  Destroyed.
[02:57:35.946 --> 02:57:36.226]  Gone.
[02:57:36.266 --> 02:57:38.067]  And they just, they're so pleased.
[02:57:38.167 --> 02:57:42.670]  And the New York Times smiles and says, Alex, nobody attacked protesters.
[02:57:43.451 --> 02:57:44.051]  Nobody.
[02:57:44.111 --> 02:57:45.552]  Nobody blocked Trump, people.
[02:57:45.912 --> 02:57:46.993]  You're a liar.
[02:57:47.013 --> 02:57:47.913]  And they smile.
[02:57:48.234 --> 02:57:49.314]  We got your kid.
[02:57:49.875 --> 02:57:50.175]  Now!
[02:57:52.329 --> 02:57:53.669]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:57:55.290 --> 02:57:57.370]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:57:57.630 --> 02:57:58.710]  I believe in you!
[02:57:58.730 --> 02:58:00.270]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:58:02.091 --> 02:58:04.931]  One man, Everett's a woman!
[02:58:05.251 --> 02:58:06.872]  Old genitals were cut off!
[02:58:07.112 --> 02:58:09.532]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:58:09.672 --> 02:58:10.892]  And we're not backing down on her!
[02:58:12.173 --> 02:58:13.733]  I want to get these people!
[02:58:13.773 --> 02:58:14.513]  We're winning!
[02:58:14.553 --> 02:58:15.653]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:58:15.813 --> 02:58:16.273]  Can't you?
[02:58:16.573 --> 02:58:18.214]  We have broken their back!
[02:58:18.554 --> 02:58:19.674]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:58:23.550 --> 02:58:23.890]  Let's go!
[02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:24.051]  Come on!
[02:58:24.071 --> 02:58:24.351]  Come on!
[02:58:24.471 --> 02:58:25.272]  Come on!
[02:58:25.492 --> 02:58:25.792]  Come on!
[02:58:25.812 --> 02:58:26.033]  Come on!
[02:58:26.093 --> 02:58:26.413]  Come on!
[02:58:26.433 --> 02:58:26.653]  Come on!
[02:58:26.733 --> 02:58:27.054]  Come on!
[02:58:27.074 --> 02:58:27.274]  Come on!
[02:58:27.374 --> 02:58:27.614]  Come on!
[02:58:27.694 --> 02:58:27.914]  Come on!
[02:58:28.015 --> 02:58:28.275]  Come on!
[02:58:28.295 --> 02:58:28.595]  Come on!
[02:58:28.635 --> 02:58:28.955]  Come on!
[02:58:28.975 --> 02:58:29.216]  Come on!
[02:58:29.236 --> 02:58:29.376]  Come on!
[02:58:29.396 --> 02:58:29.536]  Come on!
[02:58:29.556 --> 02:58:29.756]  Come on!
[02:58:29.776 --> 02:58:29.996]  Come on!
[02:58:30.017 --> 02:58:30.177]  Come on!
[02:58:30.217 --> 02:58:30.417]  Come on!
[02:58:30.517 --> 02:58:30.697]  Come on!
[02:58:30.717 --> 02:58:30.877]  Come on!
[02:58:30.957 --> 02:58:31.178]  Come on!
[02:58:31.198 --> 02:58:31.358]  Come on!
[02:58:31.378 --> 02:58:31.538]  Come on!
[02:58:31.558 --> 02:58:31.758]  Come on!
[02:58:31.778 --> 02:58:32.199]  Come on!
[02:58:32.219 --> 02:58:32.519]  Come on!
[02:58:32.599 --> 02:58:32.819]  Come on!
[02:58:32.839 --> 02:58:33.200]  Come on!
[02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:33.520]  Come on!
[02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:33.820]  Come on!
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:34.161]  Come on!
[02:58:34.241 --> 02:58:35.122]  Come on!
[02:58:35.262 --> 02:58:35.522]  Come on!
[02:58:35.582 --> 02:58:35.742]  Come on!
[02:58:35.762 --> 02:58:35.902]  Come on!
[02:58:35.922 --> 02:58:36.163]  Come on!

[02:58:49.927 --> 02:58:55.174]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:58:55.915 --> 02:58:59.219]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:59:00.080 --> 02:59:06.328]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:59:08.110 --> 02:59:14.431]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:59:15.251 --> 02:59:20.492]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:59:21.113 --> 02:59:33.235]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[02:59:33.715 --> 02:59:36.597]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:11.659 --> 03:00:12.320]  Big Brother.
[03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:14.021]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:14.581 --> 03:00:15.722]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:16.463 --> 03:00:17.944]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:18.204 --> 03:00:19.305]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:19.845 --> 03:00:24.549]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:32.770]  Your powers are weak.
[03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:33.471]  You can't win, Darth.
[03:00:33.491 --> 03:00:38.115]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[03:00:38.135 --> 03:00:40.597]  You should not have come back!
[03:00:54.671 --> 03:00:58.112]  All right.
[03:01:11.656 --> 03:01:15.460]  During the break, as I can't stop doing it, there's literally articles published every 30 seconds.
[03:01:15.961 --> 03:01:19.424]  Fox News has come out and said I should be banned, and doesn't show what I said or did.
[03:01:19.444 --> 03:01:22.267]  Because News Corp, most of them want to get rid of their competition.
[03:01:22.287 --> 03:01:26.392]  There's this corporatist attitude of these big corporations that can't compete, they want to do this.
[03:01:26.932 --> 03:01:31.878]  Owen Benjamin of HugePianist.com, that's a person that plays the piano,
[03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:38.415]  Where do you think it ends and why do you think Jack Dorsey came out and said, oh actually we're not banning Alex Jones yet.
[03:01:38.895 --> 03:01:40.236]  He hasn't violated our rules.
[03:01:40.276 --> 03:01:47.703]  Then he came to his crew and he said, well maybe we should reach outside of our platform and judge people who are on our platform by what they say outside.
[03:01:47.763 --> 03:01:48.824]  This sounds pretty creepy.
[03:01:50.085 --> 03:01:51.726]  Yeah, it's very creepy.
[03:01:51.767 --> 03:01:57.752]  Sometimes I think a lot of this are just the sounds of dying dinosaurs that the wounded deer jumps highest because
[03:01:58.661 --> 03:02:06.804]  It's almost like in middle school or high school when you had that cool group, but then they just kept excluding people, like the mean girls, until it's just one person.
[03:02:07.364 --> 03:02:12.166]  I think that the leftist media narcissism is going to end up making it so they're just alone.
[03:02:12.646 --> 03:02:16.227]  You know, like Stephen Colbert, I think their ratings are lower than some of my live streams.
[03:02:16.848 --> 03:02:20.529]  So they're just going to be talking to themselves in some creepy little dungeon.
[03:02:21.593 --> 03:02:22.573]  And it's really happening.
[03:02:22.633 --> 03:02:26.135]  I mean, they paid $18 million for this new Anderson Cooper show.
[03:02:26.855 --> 03:02:33.018]  And one of my live streams, even censored, that I do on Saturday morning, you know, will have 100,000, 200,000 views.
[03:02:33.058 --> 03:02:34.359]  His has like 50,000 views.
[03:02:34.619 --> 03:02:37.020]  5,000 is the peak at one time.
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:44.763]  $18 million being force-fed with notices, hey, Anderson Cooper, the Vanderbilt's on.
[03:02:45.223 --> 03:02:46.284]  No one wants to watch it.
[03:02:47.024 --> 03:02:48.065]  No one wants to watch it.
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:55.723]  I love the term astroturfing, the fake grassroots, where they have all this money.
[03:02:55.883 --> 03:03:03.766]  They have so much money to promote all this nonsense, and so they'll get the sheep to come in, but no one will stay.
[03:03:03.786 --> 03:03:11.810]  It's one of those McMansions, one of these big houses built on just a horrible frame, and it just falls over.
[03:03:12.788 --> 03:03:13.568]  It's kind of funny.
[03:03:13.788 --> 03:03:19.189]  You know, I've been through this so much and I had so much fear with it when it first happened.
[03:03:19.209 --> 03:03:21.810]  You know, even Patreon said they were going to shut down my Patreon.
[03:03:22.150 --> 03:03:28.251]  And these are people, these are American citizens who just choose to give me a donation to keep free speech comedy going.
[03:03:28.271 --> 03:03:28.691]  Exactly.
[03:03:28.751 --> 03:03:37.292]  Why do people think it's cool to censor and cool to join the corporates when the corporates, when you like join them in a bubble, they don't pat you on the head.
[03:03:37.312 --> 03:03:39.933]  But it's just like feeling like you're part of the big power.
[03:03:40.533 --> 03:03:41.153]  Just fear.
[03:03:41.254 --> 03:03:47.317]  It's these people, yeah exactly, it's power over truth and it's just people that have been overcome by bitterness.
[03:03:47.917 --> 03:04:02.186]  You know, and that's why I really don't think it'll happen in America because we're, a lot of people living in America, our ancestors were the ones who wouldn't deal with that and came here and so we're kind of spawned from people that aren't.
[03:04:02.206 --> 03:04:03.747]  So you're saying the genetic memory is going to kick in?
[03:04:04.468 --> 03:04:10.371]  Yeah, and unlike Europe, we didn't lose 60 million of our alpha males in two world wars in a 30-year span.
[03:04:10.431 --> 03:04:13.272]  More than Napoleonic before that.
[03:04:13.312 --> 03:04:14.432]  That's Europe's big problem.
[03:04:14.492 --> 03:04:16.033]  I'm not being mean to Europe.
[03:04:16.053 --> 03:04:17.534]  They were just as tough as us or tougher.
[03:04:17.754 --> 03:04:19.294]  They wiped all their alpha males out.
[03:04:19.935 --> 03:04:22.756]  You know Frenchmen used to be bigger than Englishmen or Germans?
[03:04:23.896 --> 03:04:26.497]  Yeah, they were real tough guys and now they're all dead.
[03:04:26.517 --> 03:04:27.018]  They're all dead.
[03:04:27.218 --> 03:04:28.638]  They were all like Viking killers.
[03:04:29.199 --> 03:04:29.979]  They were all killed.
[03:04:30.936 --> 03:04:44.263]  Yeah, that's why the ones that bailed in like the 17-1800s to come to America, like a lot of people that we're related to... Oh, you go to areas of French Canada, there's like 6'4 big French guys that are like, they're the ones that didn't get killed.
[03:04:44.983 --> 03:04:47.364]  Yeah, but now they have Justin Trudeau to deal with.
[03:04:48.425 --> 03:04:49.785]  Who says don't say mother or father.
[03:04:50.526 --> 03:04:51.726]  No, that's hate speech.
[03:04:52.186 --> 03:04:52.827]  How dare you?
[03:04:53.207 --> 03:04:54.528]  Owen Benjamin, join us again.
[03:04:54.568 --> 03:04:55.168]  You're amazing.
[03:04:55.208 --> 03:04:55.888]  God bless you.
[03:04:55.908 --> 03:04:56.949]  You too, brother.
[03:04:56.969 --> 03:04:58.249]  HugePianist.com.
[03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:59.410]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:04.417 --> 03:05:04.877]  Have you heard?
[03:05:05.358 --> 03:05:07.420]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:08.801]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[03:05:08.981 --> 03:05:10.022]  They're all censoring us.
[03:05:10.383 --> 03:05:16.289]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[03:05:16.589 --> 03:05:19.612]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.

[03:05:47.626 --> 03:05:49.548]  Very, very cool logo.
[03:05:49.988 --> 03:05:55.712]  And kind of more discreet, so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.

[03:06:12.045 --> 03:06:20.272]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:21.173 --> 03:06:24.716]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:06:26.361 --> 03:06:28.421]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:06:28.702 --> 03:06:29.782]  I believe in you!
[03:06:30.202 --> 03:06:31.342]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:06:33.002 --> 03:06:35.983]  One man ever raped a woman!
[03:06:36.323 --> 03:06:37.903]  All genitals were cut off!
[03:06:38.163 --> 03:06:40.604]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:06:40.724 --> 03:06:41.944]  And we're not backing down on her!
[03:06:43.865 --> 03:06:45.005]  I want to kick these people!
[03:06:45.045 --> 03:06:45.565]  We're winning!
[03:06:45.605 --> 03:06:46.705]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:06:46.865 --> 03:06:47.345]  Can't you?
[03:06:47.625 --> 03:06:49.246]  We have broken their back!
[03:06:49.626 --> 03:06:50.786]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:06:54.627 --> 03:06:55.147]  Let's go!

[03:07:13.746 --> 03:07:14.046]  Come on!
[03:07:14.126 --> 03:07:14.406]  Come on!
[03:07:14.426 --> 03:07:14.666]  Come on!
[03:07:14.686 --> 03:07:14.846]  Come on!
[03:07:14.886 --> 03:07:15.146]  Come on!
[03:07:15.186 --> 03:07:15.366]  Come on!
[03:07:15.386 --> 03:07:15.566]  Come on!
[03:07:15.586 --> 03:07:15.746]  Come on!
[03:07:15.766 --> 03:07:15.947]  Come on!
[03:07:15.967 --> 03:07:16.167]  Come on!
[03:07:16.187 --> 03:07:16.427]  Come on!
[03:07:16.447 --> 03:07:16.647]  Come on!
[03:07:16.667 --> 03:07:16.807]  Come on!
[03:07:16.827 --> 03:07:17.027]  Come on!
[03:07:17.047 --> 03:07:17.187]  Come on
[03:07:19.509 --> 03:07:23.631]  I had some fun there, and that's my, you know, not my normal self there having some fun.
[03:07:24.371 --> 03:07:28.513]  But Doug Hagman is joining us of the Hagman Report and so much more.
[03:07:28.533 --> 03:07:29.694]  He's going to take over the next hour.
[03:07:30.274 --> 03:07:36.757]  But now you can see the full assault on free speech, misrepresenting what we said and done to build the straw man to take us all out.
[03:07:38.037 --> 03:07:39.538]  Why does Jack Dorsey not ban us?
[03:07:39.938 --> 03:07:40.738]  Everybody else has.
[03:07:40.798 --> 03:07:42.159]  The media is all celebrating.
[03:07:43.183 --> 03:07:44.865]  Because they're all dependent on mainstream media.
[03:07:44.885 --> 03:07:48.248]  They're all dependent on the social networks saying, oh, Jones is over.
[03:07:48.288 --> 03:07:48.969]  Jones is dead.
[03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:52.232]  I explained this to you idiots in establishment media before.
[03:07:53.294 --> 03:07:57.858]  They'd already shadow banned us 90 plus percent on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
[03:07:58.959 --> 03:08:01.963]  So I openly poked the bear.
[03:08:03.499 --> 03:08:19.640]  Not to get them to ban us, just so that it would trigger an accelerated event to have a debate ahead of the election about the fact that you're letting the leftists and the globalists and the islamicists all have free reign, but Americans and patriots and Christians and free marketers are all being censored!
[03:08:21.052 --> 03:08:23.634]  And it's all coming to a head right now.
[03:08:24.354 --> 03:08:25.735]  So it's an epic time to be alive.
[03:08:26.235 --> 03:08:28.256]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:08:28.276 --> 03:08:43.186]  The power of you going and getting the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app on Droid or on iPhone has already sent us a number one on news on both platforms and in the top
[03:08:44.558 --> 03:08:47.141]  30 to 60, depending on where you're at in total apps globally.
[03:08:47.482 --> 03:08:48.944]  We just launched this three weeks ago.
[03:08:49.304 --> 03:08:50.545]  We thought the purge was coming.
[03:08:51.106 --> 03:08:55.031]  And I even thought it'll be nice to see them get upset when you sent it to number one.
[03:08:55.071 --> 03:08:55.812]  But more importantly,
[03:08:57.463 --> 03:08:58.523]  InfoWars.com.
[03:08:59.623 --> 03:09:18.927]  InfoWars.com forward slash show has where you can subscribe directly with us, not with Android, not with a shy comrade on Apple, with Cook openly working for them, but the Alex Jones Show, The Real News with David Knight, The Warren with Owen Schroer, and others like Roger Stone.
[03:09:18.947 --> 03:09:20.628]  So that's really where the fight is.
[03:09:20.708 --> 03:09:22.328]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:09:23.427 --> 03:09:24.348]  We have no comments.
[03:09:24.848 --> 03:09:26.569]  Discuss Us, we've used for eight years.
[03:09:27.069 --> 03:09:27.510]  Bandits.
[03:09:29.251 --> 03:09:30.992]  WebChimp, we've been using for seven, eight years.
[03:09:31.072 --> 03:09:31.452]  Bandits.
[03:09:32.232 --> 03:09:33.313]  They're hitting our DNSs.
[03:09:33.573 --> 03:09:34.614]  They're hacking us right now.
[03:09:34.654 --> 03:09:35.354]  They're attacking us.
[03:09:36.095 --> 03:09:37.576]  People say, oh my God, you should give up.
[03:09:37.676 --> 03:09:40.758]  No, I'm under attack because I'm over the target.
[03:09:42.199 --> 03:09:44.800]  And so if they're successful, I don't do false flags.
[03:09:45.441 --> 03:09:51.264]  I can step back and have the engineers, like in a Star Trek thing with smoke coming out, trying to keep it going and say, go eat lunch.
[03:09:51.284 --> 03:09:52.225]  We'd be down right now.
[03:09:53.277 --> 03:09:56.640]  So then being up there 18 hours, two days ago, right?
[03:09:56.680 --> 03:09:57.401]  They're cross-eyed.
[03:09:57.902 --> 03:10:00.584]  I can step back and say, you boys go home and see your wives and children.
[03:10:00.904 --> 03:10:02.006]  We'd be down right now.
[03:10:02.486 --> 03:10:04.048]  I can say, oh my God, they took us down.
[03:10:04.088 --> 03:10:04.948]  But see, I don't do that.
[03:10:04.968 --> 03:10:05.869]  I don't fight dirty.
[03:10:06.610 --> 03:10:09.653]  We're going to fight to the end, but we may go down the next few days.
[03:10:09.693 --> 03:10:11.275]  They're hitting us that you couldn't imagine.
[03:10:11.855 --> 03:10:12.035]  So.
[03:10:12.932 --> 03:10:13.333]  We're here.
[03:10:13.433 --> 03:10:14.314]  We're trying to hold it up.
[03:10:14.374 --> 03:10:15.475]  We don't make a big deal out of it.
[03:10:16.036 --> 03:10:18.919]  But it's not just, oh, take me off these corporations, whatever.
[03:10:18.960 --> 03:10:27.790]  They're taking us down everywhere because, just like they just busted 12 kids trained for mass shootings, just like the left's getting ready to move, they don't want us reaching a general audience.
[03:10:29.053 --> 03:10:30.053]  Ahead of a big event.
[03:10:30.113 --> 03:10:30.934]  That's my intel.
[03:10:31.294 --> 03:10:42.479]  And I can't wait to hear our guest host, Doug Hagman, police and investigative trainer, best-selling author, researcher, great political mind, helped break some of the biggest news in 2016 about the pedophile rings.
[03:10:42.959 --> 03:10:51.582]  Clearly, I think, I love to make it about Infowars, but I gotta tell you, they're just trying to silence us, I think, Doug, ahead of something really big and them making their move.
[03:10:51.602 --> 03:10:52.223]  What's your intel?
[03:10:52.243 --> 03:10:52.983]  Go ahead and take over.
[03:10:54.666 --> 03:10:55.546]  Alex, thank you very much.
[03:10:55.586 --> 03:10:57.207]  By the way, congratulations on your app.
[03:10:57.828 --> 03:11:00.950]  We've all downloaded it here at the office and it's marvelous.
[03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.951]  It's a great thing.
[03:11:02.852 --> 03:11:06.315]  As a matter of fact, one more thing before you run out.
[03:11:06.355 --> 03:11:13.840]  I just want to tell you that we have a mutual friend I spoke with yesterday and right after Matt Drudge visited your studios,
[03:11:15.390 --> 03:11:16.290]  He had a conversation.
[03:11:16.310 --> 03:11:17.671]  He's also a friend with Matt Drudge.
[03:11:17.691 --> 03:11:19.331]  He had a conversation with Mr. Drudge.
[03:11:21.392 --> 03:11:40.618]  Matt Drudge had said that the reason that Alex Jones is so popular and would be the first to be targeted, and I quote this, and I wrote this down when I was speaking with this gentleman, is that Alex Jones and InfoWars has the pulse of the nation in their finger on the pulse of the nation.
[03:11:41.587 --> 03:11:52.349]  That's what makes InfoWars and you so dangerous, is because you're plugged into that pulse that's representative of our republic.
[03:11:52.569 --> 03:11:53.509]  So great job on that.
[03:11:53.529 --> 03:11:54.710]  Can you not feel the pulse?
[03:11:54.990 --> 03:11:57.170]  It's like you feel America coming back.
[03:11:57.230 --> 03:11:57.770]  It's spiritual.
[03:11:57.790 --> 03:11:59.771]  It's like boom, boom, boom.
[03:12:00.071 --> 03:12:00.951]  That's what they're scared of.
[03:12:00.971 --> 03:12:02.251]  And they think they shut me down?
[03:12:02.271 --> 03:12:03.692]  No, no, no.
[03:12:03.752 --> 03:12:05.092]  This is worldwide.
[03:12:05.132 --> 03:12:05.852]  People are awakening.
[03:12:06.707 --> 03:12:08.388]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:12:09.908 --> 03:12:11.309]  We're battling on a number of planes here.
[03:12:11.329 --> 03:12:20.053]  Obviously, you've got the sporadic political violence, you've got the economic aspects, you've got the political warfare, but this, the censorship or the banning, I should say,
[03:12:20.943 --> 03:12:21.184]  Thank you.
[03:12:43.621 --> 03:12:51.205]  Well, you're taking over and hosting, but clearly they're making their move, and I've been told by sources that they have Islamic training camps all over the U.S.
[03:12:51.245 --> 03:12:52.145]  We know about some of them.
[03:12:52.165 --> 03:12:52.746]  We've covered them.
[03:12:53.126 --> 03:13:01.110]  The left attacks us when we cover it, but this bust of 12 kids trained for school shootings, you can see them getting ready to trigger this, everything else.
[03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:03.731]  They want us off the air for something big.
[03:13:03.811 --> 03:13:04.712]  Doug, what is it?
[03:13:06.098 --> 03:13:07.539]  Well, I think it's a combination of things.
[03:13:07.619 --> 03:13:16.047]  Number one, if you're calling out the, again, the sporadic politically charged violence.
[03:13:16.687 --> 03:13:18.069]  But it's something much bigger than that.
[03:13:18.269 --> 03:13:21.992]  And I think it's all part of this ongoing civil war.
[03:13:22.052 --> 03:13:23.353]  It's a component of the civil war.
[03:13:23.814 --> 03:13:28.918]  The New Mexico compound figures dramatically in this.
[03:13:30.379 --> 03:13:32.862]  I was on your show, I was on Infowars.
[03:13:34.345 --> 03:13:47.377]  Oh my goodness, a couple of, I think probably now a month ago, maybe a month and a half ago, with Dr. Paul L. Williams, we were talking about the investigation that I conducted into Islamberg, which is the Muslims of the Americas, headed by Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani.
[03:13:48.187 --> 03:13:59.333]  And the deal with that is this, the CIA basically brought Jelani into the United States back in 1980, or at least it was on their dime, and he set up shop in Brooklyn.
[03:13:59.713 --> 03:14:06.517]  And Sheikh Mubarak Jelani began what is known as the Muslims of the Americas, or the community of the impoverished.
[03:14:06.677 --> 03:14:08.157]  It's known as the Jamaat al-Fuqra.
[03:14:08.798 --> 03:14:12.920]  And for a while, it was on the terrorist watch list in the United States.
[03:14:14.113 --> 03:14:25.358]  Well, it was after 9-11, and it was after the events that they're in, 2003, 4, 5, in that time period.
[03:14:26.198 --> 03:14:43.506]  I had conducted surveillance of an Islamic training camp that we've talked about on this show, folks, and I've disclosed, and of course, the focus of which, the training compounds, at least primarily, were the Muslims of the Americas, Jammal al-Fukhra, headed by this Pakistani sheikh.
[03:14:44.662 --> 03:14:54.448]  Well, we saw yesterday, excuse me, what we saw breaking the news yesterday, this New Mexico compound is connected directly to the Muslims of the Americas.
[03:14:54.468 --> 03:14:57.410]  It's connected to the various compounds all across the United States.
[03:14:57.450 --> 03:15:01.433]  This, of course, a very small version of the larger ones out there.
[03:15:02.453 --> 03:15:05.295]  And what it was taking place is there's a recruitment drive.
[03:15:06.361 --> 03:15:08.923]  Black Muslims in prisons all across the United States.
[03:15:08.943 --> 03:15:09.743]  I've documented this.
[03:15:09.763 --> 03:15:11.064]  I've sent this to the FBI.
[03:15:11.584 --> 03:15:16.047]  I had sent this to the FBI back in 2007, 2007, 2008, I believe it was, based on my own personal observations.
[03:15:16.107 --> 03:15:19.369]  In fact, InfoWars had, you can go back in the archives, well, no.
[03:15:26.424 --> 03:15:38.231]  Infowars had shown the school buses on the property in Hancock, New York, where the school bus was being used for training, military-style training, paramilitary-style training.
[03:15:39.292 --> 03:15:46.756]  And you gotta tell you, this is a smaller version of that.
[03:15:47.957 --> 03:15:52.019]  So the bottom line is, what we're seeing right now is this
[03:15:56.261 --> 03:15:57.622]  Refinement, if you will.
[03:15:59.502 --> 03:16:04.724]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[03:16:04.864 --> 03:16:05.924]  I don't know exactly what happened.
[03:16:06.164 --> 03:16:07.325]  Sandy Hook's inconclusive.
[03:16:07.505 --> 03:16:15.588]  For years, Alex Jones was the most powerful voice behind a disturbing conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook shooting was a massive hoax.
[03:16:15.628 --> 03:16:18.008]  He has claimed the school shooting was a hoax.
[03:16:18.128 --> 03:16:25.611]  Alex Jones is making news and the parents of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut are quite disturbed by some of the messages he's sending out.
[03:16:25.851 --> 03:16:30.335]  People who believe Jones have for years harassed and taunted families of the victims.
[03:16:30.855 --> 03:16:34.819]  The lawsuits filed in April seek at least $1 million in damages.
[03:16:34.839 --> 03:16:44.066]  Jones' comments have caused them a severe degree of mental stress and anguish, which have disrupted their daily routine and caused a high degree of psychological pain.
[03:16:44.086 --> 03:16:49.291]  Parents have said Jones has engaged in a campaign of false, cruel, and dangerous assertions.
[03:16:49.371 --> 03:16:54.055]  A theory that Leonard Posner and Veronique de la Rosa say turned their lives upside down.
[03:16:54.355 --> 03:17:04.019]  The parents of six-year-old Noah Posner, who was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, say Jones' followers have tormented them with death threats, forcing them to move seven times.
[03:17:04.039 --> 03:17:06.840]  I can't imagine being a Sandy Hook parent and having to go through this.
[03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:10.121]  Alex Jones, his commentary about Sandy Hook is disgusting.
[03:17:10.401 --> 03:17:11.162]  It's appalling.
[03:17:11.342 --> 03:17:12.422]  We all stand against it.
[03:17:12.442 --> 03:17:12.842]  9-11 as well.
[03:17:12.862 --> 03:17:13.003]  9-11.
[03:17:13.063 --> 03:17:16.604]  On the left and the right, we stand against this kind of hate speech, which is what it is.
[03:17:16.764 --> 03:17:21.729]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[03:17:21.769 --> 03:17:23.750]  They're alleging in these lawsuits a conspiracy.
[03:17:23.951 --> 03:17:31.938]  A reporter in the courtroom said that Jones' attorney told the judge today his client's comments are political speech and commentary and not defamatory.
[03:17:32.038 --> 03:17:34.801]  I take a lot of flack coming on your show and representing you.
[03:17:34.981 --> 03:17:36.742]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[03:17:38.163 --> 03:17:39.124]  Good friends, family.
[03:17:39.585 --> 03:17:41.146]  CNN's not calling anymore.
[03:17:41.446 --> 03:17:47.470]  And I say, well, you know, tell me if you're so, you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[03:17:47.530 --> 03:17:53.615]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times or they'll send me a link to some other article saying, you know, paraphrasing what you said.
[03:17:53.655 --> 03:17:56.017]  I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[03:17:56.537 --> 03:17:59.919]  And when I go find it, I said, well, that's not really what was said here.
[03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:02.480]  Well then, you know, then there's like this back pedal.
[03:18:02.520 --> 03:18:05.861]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[03:18:05.901 --> 03:18:10.342]  There was another lawsuit this week targeting people that promote conspiracy theories.
[03:18:10.462 --> 03:18:14.023]  It involves InfoWars and the host of InfoWars, Alex Jones.
[03:18:14.443 --> 03:18:29.427]  Already InfoWars is at risk of losing its YouTube channel, and now this lawsuit is trying to take Jones and InfoWars and others to court, saying they're responsible for promoting hoaxes that actually are defamatory toward the people involved.
[03:18:29.527 --> 03:18:30.187]  Xi Nian has been
[03:18:30.487 --> 03:18:33.008]  Basically, a murder for free speech for the last 24 hours.
[03:18:33.488 --> 03:18:38.630]  At the same time, they're telling us how important it is that people should be able to say what they think.
[03:18:39.050 --> 03:18:42.651]  They are agitating for Alex Jones to be pulled off YouTube.
[03:18:42.691 --> 03:18:48.433]  Now, I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than, like, Bill Maher, Michelle Wolf, or Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:18:48.993 --> 03:18:52.878]  Well, he's got a point of view and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[03:18:52.958 --> 03:18:56.843]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[03:18:57.304 --> 03:18:59.687]  He's been called a freak show and downright dangerous.
[03:18:59.747 --> 03:19:06.816]  People have free speech in this country, but no matter how hateful, no matter how stupid, no matter how inane, give them their time, give them Thorazine also.
[03:19:07.276 --> 03:19:08.997]  What is the matter with this person?
[03:19:09.217 --> 03:19:11.719]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[03:19:11.759 --> 03:19:14.681]  The hypocrisy is just astounding.
[03:19:14.921 --> 03:19:20.405]  And I guarantee you that if you flipped over to CNN right now, there would not be a single story about the Twitter shadow banning.
[03:19:20.585 --> 03:19:21.546]  There would not be a single story.
[03:19:21.746 --> 03:19:36.116]  And the only story you would see about YouTube pulling Alex Jones videos would be probably something celebratory about, you know, a scalp of sorts for managing to eventually get their way on that story.
[03:19:36.476 --> 03:19:41.917]  Jones' lawyers will be back in court for a separate defamation case related to the Parkland shooting tomorrow.
[03:19:41.957 --> 03:19:47.919]  This was probably the first time that anybody in that courtroom had actually watched InfoWars.
[03:19:48.219 --> 03:19:49.539]  Had actually seen what you said.
[03:19:50.199 --> 03:19:57.681]  And if you watch what you said, and you compare that to what the press has reported that you said, it's as if those two things are happening on two different planets.
[03:20:03.897 --> 03:20:08.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.566 --> 03:20:18.031]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:20:18.631 --> 03:20:20.093]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:25.393 --> 03:20:27.694]  And this is Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:20:27.774 --> 03:20:32.455]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, sitting in for Alex, InfoWars.com.
[03:20:32.555 --> 03:20:36.217]  Folks, we are... I kind of stopped abruptly at that last segment.
[03:20:36.237 --> 03:20:40.198]  I'm going to get into the New Mexico compound because I think that's so important.
[03:20:40.218 --> 03:20:45.520]  And Alex made some great points about the Muslim training compounds and about this particular story.
[03:20:45.540 --> 03:20:46.600]  And folks, you
[03:20:47.623 --> 03:21:03.719]  We're told about this, the people who listen to InfoWars.com and of course my platform HagenReport.com, we had told you about the threat of Islamists in this country preparing to make war at a given time and I had sent a report to the FBI as a matter of fact
[03:21:04.426 --> 03:21:11.251]  This is, during the break, this is a copy, if you're watching this, this is the exact copy of what I sent to the FBI.
[03:21:11.632 --> 03:21:23.021]  This is just the text of my report, not including the video as well as the photographic evidence that I took of these training compounds.
[03:21:23.581 --> 03:21:25.903]  And the date on that was February 12th of 2006.
[03:21:25.943 --> 03:21:26.924]  And we've talked about that on this show.
[03:21:30.763 --> 03:21:46.088]  But before I get into that, I want to use this segment here just to talk about the subject that's really on everybody's mind, on everybody's lips, and that's the censorship or the banning, more appropriate or more accurately, the banning of InfoWars.
[03:21:46.809 --> 03:21:55.812]  And the way I look at it is we're right now, we're at a time when the dominant form of speech in this nation is carried by private companies.
[03:21:56.906 --> 03:22:01.931]  And what we saw this week is these private companies moving in lockstep.
[03:22:01.951 --> 03:22:02.732]  Now consider this.
[03:22:04.073 --> 03:22:10.580]  It's effectively just as bad when you have got private companies moving in lockstep with one another.
[03:22:11.281 --> 03:22:14.804]  It is effectively just as bad as government-controlled speech, is it not?
[03:22:14.864 --> 03:22:17.007]  Because the result is effectively the same.
[03:22:17.067 --> 03:22:18.008]  It's essentially the same.
[03:22:18.028 --> 03:22:19.089]  This is exactly what we saw.
[03:22:20.308 --> 03:22:26.213]  When I took a look at this, and we knew this was coming, Alex knew this was coming, just didn't have a when.
[03:22:26.433 --> 03:22:30.277]  You kind of know when the bombs are on their way.
[03:22:30.297 --> 03:22:32.639]  You just don't know exactly, precisely when they're going to hit.
[03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:46.751]  But when you look at this, and when you start taking away, peeling back the layers of this onion, you've got Apple, you've got Facebook, you've got Spotify, YouTube, which is an alphabet Google company, of course.
[03:22:47.777 --> 03:22:49.298]  They all banned InfoWars.
[03:22:49.338 --> 03:22:51.418]  Now consider this within a 12-hour period.
[03:22:51.759 --> 03:22:52.459]  And I looked into this.
[03:22:52.539 --> 03:22:53.739]  I did my own investigation.
[03:22:55.060 --> 03:23:11.466]  And when I looked at this, when you consider the timing and consider how they were all banned in a matter of 12 hours, the only conclusion that you can come up with, that any reasonable person can come up with, was that this was a coordinated attack.
[03:23:11.886 --> 03:23:12.546]  It was coordinated.
[03:23:13.827 --> 03:23:16.888]  And when you, okay, looking at it a step further,
[03:23:18.820 --> 03:23:34.450]  The issue really isn't that InfoWars was banned by these private companies, although it is, I guess, but it was the method in which it was done by these four unbelievably powerful companies working in concert within the span of 12 hours.
[03:23:35.651 --> 03:23:43.736]  When you look at the net value of these companies, where you've got Apple, a trillion dollar value, when you've got Google, 850 billion
[03:23:45.763 --> 03:23:49.985]  You've got Facebook at $500 billion or half a trillion dollars.
[03:23:51.245 --> 03:23:53.906]  You've got Spotify at $32 billion.
[03:23:56.207 --> 03:24:02.710]  Doing the math, and assuming I did this correctly, you've got $2.4 trillion in those companies alone.
[03:24:04.811 --> 03:24:14.675]  Consider that there are only seven countries in the world with a gross domestic product that have a similar value or the influence that that GDP would carry.
[03:24:16.420 --> 03:24:24.601]  Those four tech companies have exercised what appears to be effectively the sovereign power.
[03:24:26.144 --> 03:24:31.048]  So, look at it a little bit differently than perhaps we've looked at it before.
[03:24:31.108 --> 03:24:37.453]  And I know that the phrase is, well, it's an antitrust issue come in.
[03:24:37.513 --> 03:24:44.658]  And there are a lot of different, I've heard so much over the last couple of days, because we have a stake in this as well.
[03:24:44.778 --> 03:24:46.319]  We are being banned as well.
[03:24:46.799 --> 03:24:47.340]  And you know what?
[03:24:47.600 --> 03:24:48.161]  You're next.
[03:24:49.181 --> 03:24:50.002]  And about that.
[03:24:51.552 --> 03:25:00.795]  I've seen so many people say, well, I don't use Facebook, or I quit using Twitter, or I just don't bother with the social networking, so it really doesn't affect me.
[03:25:02.695 --> 03:25:05.256]  Or, I don't listen to Infowars.
[03:25:06.216 --> 03:25:08.097]  And you know all of the stories.
[03:25:08.157 --> 03:25:10.357]  You know all of the general stories.
[03:25:11.078 --> 03:25:15.159]  Consider that the Jews did not have to listen to Hitler's radio speeches.
[03:25:15.219 --> 03:25:16.679]  They didn't have to listen to his rants.
[03:25:18.019 --> 03:25:19.940]  The problem, when you consider it,
[03:25:20.771 --> 03:25:22.172]  The Germans were listening.
[03:25:23.312 --> 03:25:28.875]  And what do we have today with the claims of Nazism and what have you?
[03:25:28.935 --> 03:25:30.976]  We've got a very similar situation.
[03:25:31.016 --> 03:25:37.398]  I'm not talking about the Holocaust.
[03:25:37.698 --> 03:25:47.903]  I'm talking about the parallels to the society, today's society, with the sovereign power
[03:25:48.783 --> 03:25:52.044]  That these four companies actually have amassed.
[03:25:53.085 --> 03:25:58.347]  And again, the excuse, well, I don't use them or this doesn't affect me, it's not going to wash.
[03:25:58.727 --> 03:26:01.608]  And the Nuremberg defense, it's not going to work.
[03:26:02.488 --> 03:26:08.831]  But I want to take you back a little bit, just a little bit ago, as I conclude this segment here.
[03:26:08.851 --> 03:26:10.792]  I want to take you back in time.
[03:26:11.052 --> 03:26:16.214]  Remember, in 2009, right after the election, Cass Sunstein,
[03:26:17.012 --> 03:26:26.116]  Obama appointed Cass Sunstein as the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs officer.
[03:26:26.176 --> 03:26:27.357]  I want to make sure I got that right.
[03:26:27.657 --> 03:26:29.218]  However brief in time.
[03:26:29.258 --> 03:26:30.218]  The intent was there.
[03:26:32.179 --> 03:26:42.004]  Okay, the plans for this kind of censorship or this kind of banning or this kind of making the evolution of fake news began with Obama.
[03:26:42.284 --> 03:26:43.985]  It began back in 2008 after his election.
[03:26:47.063 --> 03:26:52.186]  And what we're seeing today is the payback, if you will, to the 2016 elections.
[03:26:53.287 --> 03:26:55.048]  I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
[03:26:55.088 --> 03:27:01.552]  I'm just kind of prefacing everything with the information I think is important because when you look back in time,
[03:27:02.669 --> 03:27:15.637]  After the 2009 appointment of Cass Sunstein, and remember Cass Sunstein, who he is, in my view, a communist as well, married to Samantha Power, of the unmasking fame.
[03:27:15.677 --> 03:27:17.058]  You think that this is a coincidence?
[03:27:17.238 --> 03:27:17.838]  I think not.
[03:27:18.899 --> 03:27:20.640]  But let's fast forward from 2009 to 2011.
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:26.964]  In 2011, on February 17th, there was a photograph that was floating around the internet.
[03:27:27.964 --> 03:27:28.464]  And I don't know
[03:27:29.841 --> 03:27:39.409]  I don't know if it can be brought up, but it was a February 17th, 2011 meeting with many of the tech giants in San Francisco.
[03:27:40.069 --> 03:27:57.724]  It was a February 27th, 2011 meeting in San Francisco, where at that time the CEOs of Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook, Google, before it became Alphabet, Netflix, Oracle Systems, and I could go on, all met, unprecedented, with Obama and Valerie Jarrett.
[03:27:58.630 --> 03:28:08.477]  And I assert it was at that meeting that they became to an agreement of sorts or laid out the groundwork for what we're seeing today.
[03:28:08.837 --> 03:28:23.307]  Because what we're seeing today is not a product of the Donald Trump administration, but a product of the holdovers via Obama allowing this, or more accurately, coordinating
[03:28:23.968 --> 03:28:29.051]  This government's sentiment of the Obama holdovers with the private companies.
[03:28:29.211 --> 03:28:30.672]  I'm not saying the government did this.
[03:28:30.852 --> 03:28:33.793]  I'm saying that elements within the government did this.
[03:28:33.833 --> 03:28:36.615]  And there's a picture, if you're watching this live, there's a picture on the screen.
[03:28:37.575 --> 03:28:39.636]  So that's why history is so important.
[03:28:39.716 --> 03:28:44.099]  And it's so interesting how history gets revised.
[03:28:44.639 --> 03:28:49.501]  And that's why they don't want you, the deep state does not want you to know history.
[03:28:49.562 --> 03:28:51.803]  Folks, you're listening to Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[03:29:02.021 --> 03:29:03.661]  What would he do if he was President Trump?
[03:29:04.061 --> 03:29:05.121]  Dr. Paul?
[03:29:05.161 --> 03:29:18.404]  Today, you don't have a whole lot you can do, but you could use the veto pen and make everything that they want pass, use the two-thirds vote, because you should veto all these spending bills until people wake up.
[03:29:18.744 --> 03:29:19.805]  You should bring the troops home.
[03:29:19.825 --> 03:29:21.446]  We should give up on this foreign policy.
[03:29:21.466 --> 03:29:23.607]  And the President has a lot to say about foreign policy.
[03:29:24.108 --> 03:29:27.790]  And he doesn't have to send the troops around the world.
[03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:29.311]  There are no declared wars.
[03:29:29.351 --> 03:29:30.732]  Why should he be fighting wars?
[03:29:30.992 --> 03:29:32.033]  There's no reason for it.
[03:29:32.293 --> 03:29:34.915]  So I'd start bringing the troops home, saving a lot of money.
[03:29:34.935 --> 03:29:36.316]  We sent five troops.
[03:29:36.756 --> 03:29:39.997]  $10 on the Middle East since this century started.
[03:29:40.557 --> 03:29:44.338]  And the wars continue, they're ongoing, and they have to end.
[03:29:44.719 --> 03:29:52.161]  And in this atmosphere, when you have a constant war on terrorism, it means that you can justify violations of our civil liberties at home.
[03:29:52.521 --> 03:29:54.262]  And that's what's happened ever since.
[03:29:54.702 --> 03:29:58.383]  And Alex, when we first met, I think we were dealing with the Patriot Act.
[03:29:58.783 --> 03:29:59.023]  I think?
[03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:17.272]  Cut the spending, bring the troops home.
[03:30:17.392 --> 03:30:19.934]  You know, curtail the power of the Fed.
[03:30:19.974 --> 03:30:21.235]  We should get rid of the Fed.
[03:30:21.416 --> 03:30:25.399]  But in the meantime, I would tell the Congress, look, we're going to find out what these guys are doing.
[03:30:25.779 --> 03:30:27.561]  They are terrified.
[03:30:27.601 --> 03:30:35.247]  Republicans and Democrats are terrified that we would ever get hold of the books on the Federal Reserve and find out who's really making the big buck.
[03:30:35.547 --> 03:30:40.872]  Then a lot of people ask me, I guess they ask you, who actually is the dealing with the state?
[03:30:41.132 --> 03:30:42.353]  Well, we would find out.
[03:30:42.413 --> 03:30:45.134]  If you find out what's in the Fed, that deep state will be there.
[03:30:45.395 --> 03:30:49.397]  And it won't be one group of people, five people who run the world.
[03:30:49.417 --> 03:30:51.118]  There's going to be a lot of different people.
[03:30:51.458 --> 03:30:56.461]  They'll be in banking, and they're going to be in foreign policy and military-industrial conflict.
[03:30:56.821 --> 03:30:58.362]  So you've got to get to the Fed.
[03:30:58.783 --> 03:31:01.024]  And besides, the Fed is the economic planner.
[03:31:01.104 --> 03:31:01.784]  They plan.
[03:31:01.804 --> 03:31:02.165]  They think.
[03:31:02.185 --> 03:31:02.445]  They know.
[03:31:03.566 --> 03:31:05.648]  They don't know what interest rates should be.
[03:31:06.168 --> 03:31:07.830]  They think they know what we do with deficit.
[03:31:08.010 --> 03:31:09.191]  We print money for it.
[03:31:09.531 --> 03:31:10.632]  That all has to stop.
[03:31:10.912 --> 03:31:16.297]  A president could do it, but quite frankly, that president wouldn't be in office for very long.
[03:31:16.978 --> 03:31:23.343]  It would be such a challenge to the establishment that they would probably do, there would probably be an impeachment.
[03:31:24.224 --> 03:31:25.745]  It would be bipartisan.
[03:31:25.765 --> 03:31:30.067]  They could impeach an individual like I'm talking about because it would be such a challenge.
[03:31:30.127 --> 03:31:36.931]  But I still think that there's a bipartisan collusion on financing big government.
[03:31:37.411 --> 03:31:40.653]  Alex, you've seen me work for years about the Federal Reserve.
[03:31:41.613 --> 03:31:43.335]  Republicans aren't any better than the Democrats.
[03:31:43.355 --> 03:31:56.351]  They all love the Federal Reserve because it finances the military-industrial complex, it takes care of the welfare state, takes care of the deficits, and that's where big government is, and that's where the deep state has a lot of influence.
[03:32:00.011 --> 03:32:01.752]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:33:30.818 --> 03:33:34.199]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[03:33:34.219 --> 03:33:39.120]  By the way, if you haven't done so already, support this movement.
[03:33:39.520 --> 03:33:45.781]  And really, it's a movement, it's a great American movement that the giant has awakened.
[03:33:46.281 --> 03:33:54.045]  By the actions of the Deep State, by the shadow government, they have awakened a giant, the giant, of course, InfoWars.
[03:33:54.105 --> 03:33:58.007]  Support InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:34:19.288 --> 03:34:24.811]  Folks, look, there are no spectators in the fight that we find ourselves.
[03:34:25.131 --> 03:34:25.351]  None.
[03:34:25.832 --> 03:34:43.164]  You're either for us, meaning the people who are for free speech, for open dialogue, or you're against us, meaning you are a really a fascist or someone who supports fascism, because we are seeing this communist type activity, which is
[03:34:44.085 --> 03:34:48.588]  Which is really just a different word for fascism and Nazism.
[03:34:48.868 --> 03:34:51.169]  They're all of the same cloth, really.
[03:34:51.209 --> 03:34:53.010]  They're just different threads of the same cloth.
[03:34:53.931 --> 03:35:01.675]  That's contrary, of course, to what they want you to believe, that Nazism, for example, is from the extreme right.
[03:35:01.735 --> 03:35:02.215]  No, no, no, no.
[03:35:02.335 --> 03:35:04.677]  It's all on the extreme left, if you study history.
[03:35:04.797 --> 03:35:06.558]  And that's why they don't want you to study history.
[03:35:06.598 --> 03:35:12.021]  But again, Survival Shield, Alpha Power, all of the products
[03:35:13.180 --> 03:35:14.141]  Get some skin in the game.
[03:35:14.561 --> 03:35:15.522]  Put some skin in the game.

[03:35:17.744 --> 03:35:18.785]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:35:21.208 --> 03:35:23.009]  You'll feel better, too, on top of all that.
[03:35:23.049 --> 03:35:27.433]  Now, last segment, which I couldn't for the life of me come up with a title for.
[03:35:27.453 --> 03:35:31.357]  I want to thank the fine folks at InfoWars for helping me out on that.
[03:35:33.152 --> 03:35:36.735]  I was talking about the history, really, how we got here.
[03:35:36.755 --> 03:35:49.706]  And don't forget, it was Cass Sunstein back in 2009, and then there was that infamous but downplayed meeting in 2011, February 17th, 2011 in San Francisco, with all of the tech giants, along with Obama.
[03:35:50.646 --> 03:35:52.768]  And isn't it interesting now?
[03:35:53.589 --> 03:35:59.974]  And I believe it was during that period of time that there was this gentleman's agreement, or this agreement of sorts,
[03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:16.205]  The companies that came up with a way to shut down all of the speech, all of the information that was getting out, and InfoWars was at the very top, and I'd like to think we were too.
[03:36:17.085 --> 03:36:19.666]  And this affects too as well.
[03:36:20.566 --> 03:36:30.289]  This will affect, if it hasn't done so already, those people posting facts and information on Facebook that's antithetical to the narrative, and of course you know that.
[03:36:31.244 --> 03:36:42.510]  But, currently we see that the leftists, the establishment, the deep state, they're labeling anyone who disagrees with them as hate speech.
[03:36:43.071 --> 03:36:46.312]  And this, as Alex has said, look at the timing of this.
[03:36:46.713 --> 03:36:50.735]  90 days right now, 89 days, 90 days before the midterm elections.
[03:36:50.855 --> 03:36:52.055]  Is that a coincidence?
[03:36:52.136 --> 03:36:52.696]  I think not.
[03:36:53.576 --> 03:36:56.358]  They cannot win in the free market of ideas.
[03:36:57.987 --> 03:37:02.110]  They cannot argue, they cannot debate in the free market of ideas.
[03:37:03.010 --> 03:37:06.132]  This is why they want to censor their political opposition.
[03:37:06.572 --> 03:37:08.693]  And we saw this, where did we see this before?
[03:37:08.773 --> 03:37:15.236]  We saw this in the run-up to the 2016 election with the opposition research and the dirt that was thrown at Donald Trump.
[03:37:16.277 --> 03:37:21.219]  And we know that InfoWars, and they've been
[03:37:23.329 --> 03:37:32.062]  Made history in fours, made history and supported and was really effectively assisted in the election of Donald Trump.
[03:37:32.643 --> 03:37:37.230]  And that's, I don't think anyone can argue that now it's payback time.
[03:37:37.270 --> 03:37:38.572]  It's payback by the deep state.
[03:37:39.401 --> 03:37:42.062]  So understand what is taking place here.
[03:37:42.142 --> 03:37:47.103]  And when I say that, I don't mean to sound like I'm speaking down, but just understand what's taking place.
[03:37:47.143 --> 03:37:51.063]  And for those who are rejoicing in the banning, I've been seeing a lot of that.
[03:37:51.083 --> 03:37:52.484]  I want to speak to that for a second.
[03:37:52.504 --> 03:37:55.544]  I've just got one word, schadenfreude.
[03:37:55.564 --> 03:37:58.965]  I don't know how many people have ever heard that word, schadenfreude.
[03:37:58.985 --> 03:37:59.825]  It's a German word.
[03:37:59.845 --> 03:38:04.006]  And the meaning of which, and perhaps I've spoken about it before, the meaning of which is
[03:38:04.893 --> 03:38:10.097]  Those people who derive pleasure from someone else's troubles.
[03:38:11.358 --> 03:38:18.142]  And if that is where, and I see a lot of that, and if that's where you're at, well, that's a two-way street.
[03:38:19.283 --> 03:38:24.306]  Trust me when I tell you, because it's no fun when you
[03:38:25.831 --> 03:38:37.735]  Are the recipient of the duct tape over your mouth, or when they shut you down, or when they file lawsuits against you for expressing your ideas, or when they misrepresent, even worse, misrepresent what you say in the marketplace.
[03:38:38.535 --> 03:38:39.316]  I'm a victim of that.
[03:38:40.996 --> 03:38:43.717]  I'm a victim of lawsuits, as is InfoWars.
[03:38:44.137 --> 03:38:47.258]  It's the cheek thing to do right now.
[03:38:47.378 --> 03:38:49.219]  It's the way to silence the opposition.
[03:38:49.779 --> 03:38:50.319]  But you know what?
[03:38:50.580 --> 03:38:51.560]  Just like Alex Jones,
[03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:56.571]  It doesn't make me want to crawl up in a fetal position like some snowflake.
[03:38:57.411 --> 03:38:58.492]  Frankly, it hacks me off.
[03:38:59.032 --> 03:39:00.492]  And it makes me more determined to fight.
[03:39:01.132 --> 03:39:05.114]  And fight I will, and fight so will Alex Jones, and so will InfoWars.
[03:39:06.094 --> 03:39:14.056]  So I'm proud of InfoWars, and I'm proud of the side that we're on in this fight.
[03:39:14.876 --> 03:39:17.437]  But I want to address another issue as well.
[03:39:18.343 --> 03:39:33.438]  Because I mentioned in the previous segment as well as this segment about the meeting and about the fact that we're looking at private companies with a gross domestic product equivalent of $2.7 trillion.
[03:39:35.139 --> 03:39:35.740]  Think about that.
[03:39:36.200 --> 03:39:41.686]  Think about that in terms of the sovereign power that wields in the marketplace.
[03:39:43.217 --> 03:39:57.067]  When you see things operating, when you see private companies operating in concert with each other in a 12-hour span, you think about both antitrust law as well as anti-monopoly laws and statutes.
[03:39:57.747 --> 03:40:01.470]  And there's a difference there, but without going into it, the bottom line is this.
[03:40:02.851 --> 03:40:09.035]  Some people would disagree, and I tend to agree that we want to keep government out of the private marketplace.
[03:40:09.648 --> 03:40:19.290]  But there are some would agree that the what we're seeing here is a violation of the antitrust laws, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 to be precise.
[03:40:20.331 --> 03:40:34.914]  And if you look at if you look at that and you do some research of history, you'll find that the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was a law passed by Congress under the presidency of Benjamin Harrison.
[03:40:35.908 --> 03:40:39.170]  And it regulated competition among enterprises.
[03:40:39.650 --> 03:40:41.051]  It's exactly what we're seeing today.
[03:40:41.851 --> 03:40:49.116]  And it authorized the Department of Justice to bring suits to enjoin, for example, to prohibit or that is to prohibit conduct violating the Act.
[03:40:50.196 --> 03:40:55.899]  And additionally authorizes private parties injured by conduct violating the Act to bring suits for treble damages.
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:40:59.121]  The reason I wanted to bring that up is because that's on the table here.
[03:40:59.381 --> 03:41:02.323]  I believe when you look at, as I said, the gross domestic product,
[03:41:03.581 --> 03:41:31.689]  2.8 equivalent thereof 2.7 trillion dollars among four companies and the behavior of of I was gonna say Osama bin Laden the behavior Barack Hussein Obama and the meetings that have that took place the nomination of Cass Sunstein the all of that the history What was that all about and then of course the payback because as Alex has said many times and as I've said many times
[03:41:32.839 --> 03:41:35.021]  The deep state, the shadow government, refuses.
[03:41:35.381 --> 03:41:38.604]  They absolutely do not want a repeat of 2016.
[03:41:38.664 --> 03:41:39.985]  They can't afford it.
[03:41:40.746 --> 03:41:42.407]  They cannot lose in the midterms.
[03:41:42.768 --> 03:41:43.488]  They're all in.
[03:41:44.509 --> 03:41:49.974]  And I think if people understand what this is all about, elections have consequences.
[03:41:50.594 --> 03:41:56.259]  And we're seeing the fruits of that election and the consequences right now.
[03:41:56.279 --> 03:42:00.423]  We're seeing the vile, unspeakable hatred
[03:42:01.058 --> 03:42:07.324]  by these anti-Donald Trump supporters and anti-Donald Trump people.
[03:42:08.185 --> 03:42:09.366]  They themselves are the Nazis.
[03:42:09.446 --> 03:42:10.207]  It's all coming out.
[03:42:10.247 --> 03:42:12.469]  And again, I mentioned Schadenfreude.
[03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:21.138]  Bottom line, if you're taking some sort of pleasure in seeing this, well, it's to your own peril.
[03:42:22.038 --> 03:42:24.581]  And I've got a message, finally, for this segment.
[03:42:25.949 --> 03:42:45.963]  If, in fact, you think that this is a victory for your side, for the deep state, for the shadow government, get another thing coming, because it only makes us collectively stronger, it makes us collectively more determined, and it makes us, actually, it gets us off the couch, gets us away from our keyboards, and we are going to be
[03:42:46.886 --> 03:42:48.987]  Fighting back and fighting back like you've never seen.
[03:42:49.027 --> 03:42:51.409]  Folks, Doug Hagman sending it for Alex Jones.

[03:43:11.601 --> 03:43:12.421]  Who's got a hammer?
[03:43:12.722 --> 03:43:13.202]  Where is it?
[03:43:16.345 --> 03:43:17.205]  Where's the hammer?
[03:43:18.025 --> 03:43:19.866]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor.
[03:43:19.966 --> 03:43:22.106]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering.
[03:43:22.306 --> 03:43:22.666]  Hammering.
[03:43:22.947 --> 03:43:23.347]  Hammering.
[03:43:23.627 --> 03:43:24.027]  Hammering.
[03:43:24.267 --> 03:43:24.687]  Hammering.
[03:43:24.947 --> 03:43:25.367]  Hammering.
[03:43:25.707 --> 03:43:27.348]  Stop the hammering!
[03:43:27.868 --> 03:43:28.148]  Hammering.
[03:43:28.528 --> 03:43:28.928]  Hammering.
[03:43:29.188 --> 03:43:29.588]  Hammering.
[03:43:29.848 --> 03:43:30.308]  Hammering.
[03:43:30.468 --> 03:43:31.789]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[03:43:31.809 --> 03:43:33.409]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[03:43:33.549 --> 03:43:35.049]  Stop the hammering.
[03:43:35.329 --> 03:43:35.749]  Hammering.
[03:43:35.969 --> 03:43:36.330]  Hammering.
[03:43:37.150 --> 03:43:38.030]  And all these fools...
[03:43:39.192 --> 03:43:41.393]  And all these traders don't get it.
[03:43:41.954 --> 03:43:48.358]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[03:43:48.958 --> 03:43:51.000]  It just f***ing sucks.
[03:43:51.320 --> 03:43:55.583]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[03:43:56.283 --> 03:44:02.207]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control of everything.
[03:44:02.247 --> 03:44:02.608]  They're here.

[03:45:10.241 --> 03:45:12.723]  I'm a Hispanic Trump supporter slash InfoWarrior.
[03:45:12.743 --> 03:45:15.344]  I have a couple points to make, but I want to plug for you real quick.
[03:45:15.404 --> 03:45:18.446]  Survival Shield, Mason Iodine X2, life-changing.
[03:45:18.486 --> 03:45:20.367]  Super Milk Vitality, life-changing.

[03:45:25.831 --> 03:45:27.912]  I haven't been able to try them all yet, but they're awesome.
[03:45:27.952 --> 03:45:29.593]  The hats, the t-shirts, amazing.
[03:45:29.833 --> 03:45:31.655]  Briefly, tell us what the supplements did for you.
[03:45:31.675 --> 03:45:32.896]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[03:45:32.916 --> 03:45:34.677]  Just like you, I'm about the same body type.
[03:45:34.757 --> 03:45:36.398]  I'm short, stocky, strong guy.
[03:45:36.418 --> 03:45:38.240]  I'm Puerto Rican, Italian, and Cuban.
[03:45:38.280 --> 03:45:39.721]  Hispanic, strong supporter, like I said.
[03:45:39.801 --> 03:45:41.943]  And I started working out every day.
[03:45:42.083 --> 03:45:43.444]  I lift weights every day.
[03:45:43.604 --> 03:45:45.286]  I don't even have to take the day off.
[03:45:45.366 --> 03:45:46.887]  I'm taking the Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:47.087 --> 03:45:48.228]  I drop that every morning.
[03:45:48.268 --> 03:45:49.029]  I feel fantastic.
[03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:50.269]  My skin is clearing up.
[03:45:50.289 --> 03:45:50.930]  I have psoriasis.
[03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:51.970]  So that's clearing up.
[03:45:52.010 --> 03:45:53.231]  My hair is going back thicker.
[03:45:53.251 --> 03:45:56.532]  I'm losing some of it, but it's growing back thicker in the areas that I do have it.
[03:45:56.572 --> 03:45:58.493]  The brain force is just amazing.
[03:45:58.573 --> 03:45:59.814]  That stuff makes you think.
[03:45:59.974 --> 03:46:01.074]  It keeps you on your toes.
[03:46:01.114 --> 03:46:02.315]  The same thing with the iodine.
[03:46:02.335 --> 03:46:04.656]  It just brings this clarity and this focus.
[03:46:04.716 --> 03:46:06.076]  And your products are amazing.
[03:46:06.176 --> 03:46:08.477]  It's like a cleansing for the brain when we listen to you.
[03:46:08.858 --> 03:46:10.638]  And it's just life-changing.
[03:46:10.658 --> 03:46:12.999]  And how people can go against the true resistance.
[03:46:13.059 --> 03:46:15.520]  They're going to learn soon that they're on the wrong side of history.
[03:46:15.561 --> 03:46:16.581]  And that's why we're the right.
[03:46:16.761 --> 03:46:18.264]  We're not the alt-right, we're just right.
[03:46:18.324 --> 03:46:21.910]  And I've got to say, I started Titans of Liberty's Truth Wars because of you, Alex.
[03:46:21.930 --> 03:46:23.493]  You are a big inspiration to me.
[03:46:23.513 --> 03:46:24.194]  You're the real deal.
[03:46:24.495 --> 03:46:27.220]  If anybody's listening right now, Alex Jones is the real deal.
[03:46:32.932 --> 03:46:33.392]  Have you heard?
[03:46:33.873 --> 03:46:35.955]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[03:46:36.035 --> 03:46:37.316]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[03:46:37.536 --> 03:46:38.537]  They're all censoring us.
[03:46:38.918 --> 03:46:44.804]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[03:46:45.124 --> 03:46:48.127]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[03:47:03.287 --> 03:47:05.901]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.443 --> 03:47:36.635]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones, Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, sitting in for Alex, Infowars.com, at the tip of the spear, obviously, making a difference, making a difference in the marketplace.
[03:47:36.655 --> 03:47:49.067]  And as I spoke earlier about the censorship ban, and I want to get to a couple of other issues here, including some expansion about the New Mexico Islamist compound, the
[03:47:49.808 --> 03:47:52.150]  I want to get to that here before the end of this segment.
[03:47:52.911 --> 03:48:02.600]  But I did find on the Daily Caller, and I'm not sure if Alex went over this or not, but Twitter plans hate speech crackdown after backlash from upset employees.
[03:48:03.261 --> 03:48:03.341]  Aww!
[03:48:04.955 --> 03:48:06.316]  It wants your binkies and blankets.
[03:48:06.476 --> 03:48:06.917]  That's right.
[03:48:07.317 --> 03:48:15.202]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday, yesterday, signaled a coming change to his company's speech policies following pressure from his own employees.
[03:48:15.603 --> 03:48:17.884]  So what can you say about this?
[03:48:18.365 --> 03:48:19.425]  So Twitter is next.
[03:48:19.846 --> 03:48:28.532]  Although you've got the shadow banning on Twitter, you've got all of the other issues, the censorship of political opponents, which in and of itself
[03:48:29.651 --> 03:48:33.312]  You know, you've got the left yelling collusion for crying out loud.
[03:48:33.392 --> 03:48:34.392]  Where's the collusion?
[03:48:34.432 --> 03:48:37.333]  The collusion is here with these companies.
[03:48:37.373 --> 03:48:39.514]  But now Twitter, of course, saying, well, we're going to change some things.
[03:48:39.634 --> 03:48:41.154]  We're going to change some things.
[03:48:41.855 --> 03:48:44.595]  So they're planning to accelerate a crackdown on hate speech.
[03:48:44.715 --> 03:48:46.516]  Of course, hate speech.
[03:48:46.596 --> 03:48:47.776]  That's the key phrase.
[03:48:48.577 --> 03:48:49.037]  Hate speech.
[03:48:50.277 --> 03:48:53.738]  You know, I'd like I'd like someone to define what exactly what hate speech is.
[03:48:53.758 --> 03:48:54.858]  What are the parameters?
[03:48:55.959 --> 03:48:56.919]  It's truly subjective.
[03:48:57.980 --> 03:49:05.547]  Paul Joseph Watson did videos on hate speech and what have you, but we're in a very dangerous time right now.
[03:49:06.127 --> 03:49:12.012]  And of course, as Alex Jones has said, and as I've said, they're coming obviously not just for your guns, but they're coming for you.
[03:49:12.633 --> 03:49:14.374]  Second Amendment, First Amendment, here it is.
[03:49:14.954 --> 03:49:18.858]  Which is why, by the way, you need to support this operation.
[03:49:19.498 --> 03:49:21.820]  Brain Force, 40% off, plus free shipping.
[03:49:21.840 --> 03:49:24.582]  I can't tell you what a difference that makes.
[03:49:25.102 --> 03:49:27.364]  If you're not taking Brain Force, you've got to be taking it.
[03:49:27.704 --> 03:49:29.606]  It makes it, it offers clarity.
[03:49:30.387 --> 03:49:32.108]  Of course, you can't judge it by me, right?
[03:49:32.588 --> 03:49:37.332]  But there's a clarity, the super male vitality, that makes a huge difference.
[03:49:37.492 --> 03:49:39.894]  All of the products make a great difference.
[03:49:40.777 --> 03:49:44.179]  But if you want to be in this fight and you want to stay in this fight, you got to be healthy.
[03:49:44.459 --> 03:49:47.680]  So get yourself going with the products at InfoWars store.
[03:49:48.061 --> 03:49:49.741]  They've got a super special going on.
[03:49:50.262 --> 03:49:56.104]  You know, the mainstream media, of course, they're doing everything they can do to shut InfoWars down.
[03:49:56.325 --> 03:49:59.086]  Just wipe them, just erase them off the planet.
[03:50:00.206 --> 03:50:06.970]  While the tech giants work to remove InfoWars, remove us from the internet, InfoWars are dropping.
[03:50:06.990 --> 03:50:13.134]  They're already incredibly low prices and incredible products prices to help you support the InfoWars, so please do so.
[03:50:13.154 --> 03:50:14.095]  Get some skin on the game.
[03:50:16.010 --> 03:50:16.890]  So that's Twitter.
[03:50:17.430 --> 03:50:18.771]  And here it is.
[03:50:19.091 --> 03:50:19.732]  It's Twitter.
[03:50:20.652 --> 03:50:21.773]  Changes are coming there.
[03:50:22.313 --> 03:50:27.136]  And I referenced, of course, the last segment about do we really want government involved in this?
[03:50:27.756 --> 03:50:30.278]  But look toward the actions of Obama.
[03:50:30.298 --> 03:50:35.801]  Look toward the actions of all of the usual suspects as being involved in what you see.
[03:50:36.001 --> 03:50:37.041]  And how are we going to fight them?
[03:50:37.862 --> 03:50:42.084]  We're going to fight them with everything we got because they're not going to win.
[03:50:42.425 --> 03:50:43.105]  I guarantee you.
[03:50:43.903 --> 03:50:45.184]  We're not going to let them win.
[03:50:45.645 --> 03:50:48.767]  And I ask you, help us, support us.
[03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:59.136]  Now, one of the most important things, I think, that in addition to the censorship, of course, is the infiltration.
[03:50:59.697 --> 03:51:09.345]  Alex talked about the Chai Comps and the Chinese, of course, the espionage or the potential espionage, Dianne Feinstein.
[03:51:10.959 --> 03:51:14.141]  We have the Democratic IT scandal with the Oman brothers.
[03:51:14.181 --> 03:51:17.903]  You've got all of this foreign influence in this country.
[03:51:19.424 --> 03:51:20.864]  But you've got something else as well.
[03:51:21.225 --> 03:51:25.247]  You've got, now reported this week, New Mexico.
[03:51:25.347 --> 03:51:26.628]  The New Mexico compound.
[03:51:26.688 --> 03:51:29.249]  Dad arrested at extremist Muslim.
[03:51:29.309 --> 03:51:30.770]  Note they have to put a modifier.
[03:51:30.810 --> 03:51:31.650]  They're extremist.
[03:51:32.791 --> 03:51:36.293]  Extremist Muslim site trained kids to commit school shootings.
[03:51:37.483 --> 03:51:52.113]  And I spoke a little bit about this in the first segment with Alex, but I wanted just to connect some dots here, because what we're seeing and what we've been screaming about for a long time are these Islamic training compounds.
[03:51:52.473 --> 03:52:04.141]  Now, this is rudimentary at best, but nonetheless, it doesn't take much to organize a group of school children, young children,
[03:52:05.091 --> 03:52:11.033]  Show them how to use guns, and then push them off to commit school shootings.
[03:52:11.093 --> 03:52:12.493]  Think about that for a second.
[03:52:13.293 --> 03:52:30.398]  The guy behind this particular camp, Siraj Abimna Wahaj, by the way, his son was reported missing, and the remains of a boy found on the property are believed to be those of his son.
[03:52:35.808 --> 03:52:40.991]  In addition to Siraj Bin Wahaj, you've got other individuals that were also arrested.
[03:52:41.011 --> 03:52:43.533]  But the big story here is this, and the big takeaway is this.
[03:52:44.874 --> 03:53:01.244]  All across the United States, you've got this infiltration of Islamic extremist Muslims who are intent on bringing down our representative republic in favor of a country or an area ruled by Sharia.
[03:53:01.284 --> 03:53:04.806]  They have no intention whatsoever of assimilation.
[03:53:05.501 --> 03:53:09.262]  You've got open borders which permit this invasion.
[03:53:10.002 --> 03:53:13.743]  That's not limited to the Central American residents.
[03:53:13.843 --> 03:53:15.763]  It's not limited to residents of Mexico.
[03:53:16.644 --> 03:53:26.586]  It's actually bringing forth individuals from the Middle East, from Yemen, from other Middle Eastern countries or South African countries.
[03:53:27.885 --> 03:53:35.848]  And as they come into this country, they hook up and they develop, but they hook up with people like Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani.
[03:53:35.908 --> 03:53:41.330]  They get involved with these organizations such as Jamaat al-Fuqra.
[03:53:42.211 --> 03:53:55.676]  And by the way, if Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani, if that name rings a bell, he's the sheikh who Daniel Pearl was going to interview in Lahore, Pakistan, when he was kidnapped.
[03:53:56.380 --> 03:53:57.762]  And subsequently found beheaded.
[03:53:57.802 --> 03:54:13.677]  Now the FBI of course cleared Jelani, just to be clear, because I certainly don't need another lawsuit from Jelani, but just to be clear, Jelani of course was the man that Daniel Pearl was going to meet when he was kidnapped.
[03:54:13.978 --> 03:54:18.262]  But of course the FBI cleared him of all suspicion.
[03:54:19.651 --> 03:54:24.754]  So what we have with this New Mexico compound is just a very tip of the iceberg.
[03:54:24.794 --> 03:54:26.996]  You've got numerous compounds all across the United States.
[03:54:27.076 --> 03:54:37.262]  I've documented one in Hancock, as I said, Hancock, New York, which was actually at one time served as the headquarters of this Islamic group called Jamal al-Fuqra.
[03:54:38.522 --> 03:54:45.126]  And as I said before, Dr. Paul Williams and myself, we've written extensively about it.
[03:54:48.068 --> 03:54:48.288]  These
[03:54:50.109 --> 03:55:00.215]  These training compounds, they host paramilitary training, they host armories, for lack of a better term.
[03:55:00.916 --> 03:55:11.983]  And as I said, school buses, my goodness, the one in Hancock, New York, was shown on Infowars, where school buses were in fact used, a school bus was used for practice.
[03:55:13.264 --> 03:55:16.506]  Keep your eye on this, because as we see,
[03:55:17.623 --> 03:55:20.806]  The continued banning of the truth.
[03:55:22.268 --> 03:55:34.680]  You're going to see there is a relationship between the exposure of the truth and the suppression of the truth.
[03:55:35.261 --> 03:55:36.182]  And that's what we're seeing today.
[03:55:36.202 --> 03:55:39.345]  The more that we expose, the more they've got to ban.
[03:55:40.482 --> 03:55:48.469]  So look for additional information from this particular training compound and this story as it spreads across the United States.
[03:55:49.890 --> 03:56:05.022]  Just to be clear, when I did my investigation of the Hancock report and I turned that information over to the FBI, Sheikh Jalani was notified ostensibly by the FBI after I turned my report in.
[03:56:05.829 --> 03:56:09.291]  And hence I've got a religious statement filed against me.
[03:56:09.311 --> 03:56:10.211]  It's still on the internet.
[03:56:10.231 --> 03:56:10.712]  You can read it.
[03:56:10.732 --> 03:56:12.893]  I'm not sure exactly where it is, but it's out there.
[03:56:14.153 --> 03:56:16.515]  And that gave me a visit from the FBI.
[03:56:16.635 --> 03:56:18.415]  A couple of agents said, you know what?
[03:56:18.636 --> 03:56:24.979]  We can't provide you security, but we wish you well and be careful and increase your security.
[03:56:25.479 --> 03:56:29.041]  So this is what we as American citizens face today.
[03:56:30.101 --> 03:56:35.264]  And that, by the way, was under the Bush administration and it continued even worse under Obama.
[03:56:36.286 --> 03:56:47.912]  So, in closing, as I wrap this up, and I'm so honored, by the way, to be here for Alex Jones, especially at a time like this, and for InfoWars, especially at a time like this, as I wrap this up.
[03:56:49.273 --> 03:56:50.814]  We are engaged in a civil war.
[03:56:51.414 --> 03:56:54.076]  We're engaged in asymmetrical warfare.
[03:56:54.096 --> 03:56:56.937]  And I'm going to close with this question.
[03:56:58.758 --> 03:57:01.040]  What could be worse than a civil war?
[03:57:02.941 --> 03:57:04.962]  I would say, possibly,
[03:57:06.050 --> 03:57:07.031]  Not having a civil war.
[03:57:08.092 --> 03:57:09.092]  I'd like you to think about that.
[03:57:10.594 --> 03:57:11.534]  As you finish your week.
[03:57:13.296 --> 03:57:15.277]  And as we play, really, for all the marbles.
[03:57:16.538 --> 03:57:17.979]  And we are playing for all the marbles.
[03:57:18.620 --> 03:57:19.340]  They certainly are.
[03:57:20.541 --> 03:57:25.305]  The fascists, the Nazis, the Deep State are playing for all the marbles.
[03:57:26.146 --> 03:57:27.146]  Folks, thank you so much.
[03:57:27.727 --> 03:57:31.189]  Doug Hagman again for Alex Jones, InfoWars, InfoWars.com.
[03:57:31.249 --> 03:57:33.051]  Please, please, if you do nothing else,
[03:57:34.085 --> 03:57:35.746]  Support the war effort.
[03:57:36.207 --> 03:57:37.488]  Support InfoWars.
[03:57:37.608 --> 03:57:39.129]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:40.029 --> 03:57:41.770]  A variety of products and merchandise there.
[03:57:41.951 --> 03:57:42.831]  It helps the cause.
[03:57:43.292 --> 03:57:44.652]  God bless each and every one of you.
[03:57:44.712 --> 03:57:45.393]  Thanks for having me.
[03:57:49.736 --> 03:57:54.139]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[03:57:55.160 --> 03:57:59.683]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[03:58:01.736 --> 03:58:04.817]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[03:58:05.698 --> 03:58:07.458]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[03:58:11.320 --> 03:58:15.802]  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[03:58:16.062 --> 03:58:20.583]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[03:58:20.884 --> 03:58:24.965]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[03:58:28.086 --> 03:58:29.367]  Getting a good picture everybody?
[03:58:32.383 --> 03:58:39.888]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[03:58:39.908 --> 03:58:44.051]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[03:58:44.211 --> 03:58:49.075]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[03:58:49.735 --> 03:58:50.916]  He's not a politician.
[03:58:51.737 --> 03:58:52.417]  He's one of us.
[03:58:54.919 --> 03:58:57.040]  Never, ever, ever give up.
