[00:00:02.452 --> 00:00:04.794]  Alex Jones here reporting from Hawaii.
[00:00:04.794 --> 00:00:10.119]  We're off the island of Maui, and Democrat Congressman Hank Johnson believes that islands flow.
[00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.841]  We're about to see if his theory is correct.
[00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.065]  He also believes socialism works better than capitalism, which is similar to believing that islands flow.
[00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:20.909]  But let's see if he's correct, because after all, if you don't agree with him, you're racist.
[00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.272]  This is an island that edits
[00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:33.218]  The widest level is what, 12 miles from shore to shore?
[00:00:33.218 --> 00:00:49.469]  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.930]  We don't anticipate that.
[00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:01.838]  Look, it's total proof.
[00:01:01.838 --> 00:01:03.660]  The island is the top of a mountain.
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.584]  And it just keeps going up 30,000 feet off the coast of Hawaii.
[00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:07.525]  The scientists are right.
[00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.608]  The Democrat hit Johnson strong.
[00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:10.289]  Total proof, look!
[00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:18.308]  Now, those are boats.
[00:01:18.308 --> 00:01:20.389]  Those do float.
[00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:24.471]  The pride of Maui is aluminum, and it floats on top of water.
[00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.373]  Rocks do not float on top of water.
[00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:32.116]  I would sign off as Alex Jones with Infowars.com, but now I identify as Hank Johnson, a black man from Atlanta.
[00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:35.478]  So, Hank Johnson for Infowars.com, signing off.
[00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:35.838]  Over and out.
[00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:57.047]  What happens when you put in a cage fight a giant in with a midget?
[00:01:59.056 --> 00:01:59.797]  Hey, Mr. Johnson.
[00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:03.099]  I've got a quick question for you.
[00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.241]  Have you ever, um... Oh, yeah.
[00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.942]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:08.883]  Hey, Alex Jones, the little people!
[00:02:08.883 --> 00:02:09.984]  And, and... Guam.
[00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:14.908]  I've always wanted to ask you, that was a joke when you said Guam floating, right?
[00:02:14.908 --> 00:02:15.888]  It was.
[00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:20.271]  This is a, uh, island that edits...
[00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:28.234]  The widest level is what, 12 miles from shore to shore?
[00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:41.682]  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:46.063]  Uh, we don't anticipate that.
[00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:48.105]  That's what I thought.
[00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:49.906]  You're a man with a sense of humor.
[00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:50.466]  That's right.
[00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:51.587]  I always knew that.
[00:02:51.587 --> 00:03:00.775]  Well, I always, when I'm watching C-SPAN and I see you talking, it's funny, because then you say some really witty stuff, and sometimes you say some really ridiculous stuff, and I think, I think people are maybe, like, doing things to me, taking stuff out of context.
[00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:05.638]  The midget will not win the fight, I'm gonna tell you that.
[00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:05.939]  Why?
[00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.762]  He just doesn't carry enough weight, as I,
[00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:11.045]  I think?
[00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:37.225]  Is no longer socially acceptable.
[00:03:37.225 --> 00:03:41.006]  I think we may both have to get in.
[00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:46.627]  Even the Washington Post admits, Google location, when you turn it off, they still track it.
[00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:51.148]  So, Sundar's a nice, likeable fellow, but he's not telling the truth.
[00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:56.169]  Well, I think we have to get more, we've got to get more precise with our questions.
[00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.489]  We've got to get it tight, get it right?
[00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.170]  Perhaps if we had more than five minutes, we could get into a lot better.
[00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.800]  I agree.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.103]  What do you think about Google helping censor the Chinese with their dragonfly operation?
[00:04:07.103 --> 00:04:16.932]  I think that when you are in a foreign country doing business, you do business in accordance with that country's policies.
[00:04:16.932 --> 00:04:21.736]  And so it's a difficult situation in this global environment.
[00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:23.217]  What about these folks?
[00:04:23.217 --> 00:04:25.779]  Two million Muslims have been put in concentration camps?
[00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.040]  I know nothing about that.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.621]  Here he is.
[00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:29.422]  Yeah.
[00:04:29.422 --> 00:04:32.804]  So, this is kind of an unwieldy situation.
[00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:33.524]  It must be.
[00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:34.445]  Good to meet you, too.
[00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:35.125]  Good luck to you.
[00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:36.506]  Where is Kirkland?
[00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:38.227]  I'll see him tomorrow.

[00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:17.258]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:23.061]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:25.963]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, U.S.
[00:06:25.963 --> 00:06:34.708]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:37.210]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.671]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:41.153]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:06:41.153 --> 00:06:43.516]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:06:43.516 --> 00:06:44.617]  This is all confirmed.
[00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:45.698]  This is not a drill.
[00:06:45.698 --> 00:06:49.982]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:06:49.982 --> 00:06:51.504]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:06:51.504 --> 00:06:52.405]  Apple 100%.
[00:06:52.405 --> 00:06:58.031]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:06:58.471 --> 00:07:03.535]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:04.416]  This is happening.
[00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:12.443]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:07:12.443 --> 00:07:18.808]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:07:18.808 --> 00:07:26.775]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:31.478]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:07:31.478 --> 00:07:34.980]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:42.245]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:44.946]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:50.490]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.152]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[00:07:54.072 --> 00:08:00.960]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:21.494]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:08:21.494 --> 00:08:26.755]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:31.657]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:40.203]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:47.067]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:52.971]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:57.694]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:08:57.694 --> 00:08:59.696]  I have given you the transmission.
[00:09:04.555 --> 00:09:13.865]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:09:13.865 --> 00:09:16.648]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:20.571]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:30.103]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, December 14th, 2018.
[00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:31.764]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:34.226]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:37.748]  And of course, you've got The War Room with Owen Schroyer, Roger Studdard and others.
[00:09:37.748 --> 00:09:39.029]  It kicks off every day, 3 p.m.
[00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:40.109]  Central.
[00:09:40.109 --> 00:09:44.292]  We come right back in the morning with InfoWars Live Transmission with David Knight, weekdays.
[00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.852]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:49.455]  to 11 a.m., right before this broadcast.
[00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:53.377]  I talked about basically the same subject at the start of the broadcast yesterday.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:18.978]  Radio slash TV syndicated transmission that I look at the news and I read the news and then I see what's happening on the street in my own life and what's happening in the schools and the churches and the grocery stores and the farms and factories and I get very very angry and then it's hard for me to then really go on air.
[00:10:18.978 --> 00:10:24.523]  So that's why I have to explain to folks why I either have to be very cynical about things on air or
[00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:29.382]  I'm going to start screaming and yelling, or maybe even crying.
[00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:41.072]  Because when you really do care, and you see a bunch of other people that don't, you get angry.
[00:10:41.072 --> 00:10:53.142]  And you witness how the establishment, these creatures, play on our weakest issues, play on our
[00:10:54.727 --> 00:11:06.734]  Lesser angels, and how they divide and conquer us, and how they poison us, and how they give us disinformation from birth, and how they target the children.
[00:11:06.734 --> 00:11:08.035]  It enrages me.
[00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:09.756]  You know, I don't just read the newspapers.
[00:11:09.756 --> 00:11:13.878]  I have my own personal experiences just like you do.
[00:11:13.878 --> 00:11:15.239]  And every year at the start of school, I
[00:11:20.726 --> 00:11:25.130]  See on the streets of America, and I hear about it from friends, family, and neighbors.
[00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.331]  I hear about it from my own children.
[00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:28.452]  I have four children.
[00:11:28.452 --> 00:11:36.239]  About young people that go get their vaccine and have a convulsion and are in the hospital.
[00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:42.524]  I also have a lot of friends, a lot of friends, whose two, three, four-year-olds come down with quote type 1 diabetes.
[00:11:43.957 --> 00:11:45.579]  And they say, well, it's not from their diet.
[00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:46.460]  It must be genetic.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:53.286]  Well, yeah, it's genetic that they got permanent pancreatitis and the insert says it can shut down.
[00:11:53.286 --> 00:11:59.973]  The flu shot says it can shut down your pancreas forever.
[00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:06.159]  And then school's out forever because your pancreas has been blown to pieces.
[00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:21.588]  And just like I opened the show up yesterday with all the thousands of deaths and people paralyzed by polio-like disease, but they won't say it's polio and, oh, they can't treat it and they don't want to talk about it.
[00:12:21.588 --> 00:12:25.610]  They tell you that, well, we're not going to report it.
[00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.053]  The CDC has said to hospitals, don't report this publicly.
[00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:35.057]  Do it in our secret reporting system that they use for the secret experimentation and the secret taking of blood at birth for 46 years.
[00:12:37.782 --> 00:12:41.584]  Under secret law, which we first exposed 20 years ago.
[00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:44.606]  There were then lawsuits in Texas and Minnesota, all confirmed.
[00:12:44.606 --> 00:12:52.411]  And the National Secret Worldwide Database was then discovered, run by the United Nations.
[00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:54.272]  I digress.
[00:12:54.272 --> 00:12:57.314]  I have all this incredible news, but look what I saw in my stacks!
[00:12:57.314 --> 00:12:59.355]  And I saw several others in the stacks.
[00:12:59.355 --> 00:13:01.797]  They're not even looking for vaccine damage news.
[00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:03.178]  It's there, they can't hide it.
[00:13:03.178 --> 00:13:05.519]  Rufo Regno!
[00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:06.660]  He almost died!
[00:13:09.147 --> 00:13:21.655]  And even the New York Post, even People Magazine, says the Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, hospitalized after pneumonia vaccination goes wrong.
[00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:29.259]  But every year when they get ready to shoot your kids up before school starts, what do they say on the news?
[00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:33.042]  They say safe and effective, might make the injection site sore,
[00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:38.225]  It's a conspiracy theory by the guy that says Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:39.226]  They always throw that in there.
[00:13:39.226 --> 00:13:42.026]  A lot of articles.
[00:13:42.026 --> 00:13:48.608]  In fact, hundreds every year at the start of school say Alex Jones says this, and, well, he's a racist.
[00:13:48.608 --> 00:13:51.589]  Meanwhile, my grandmother got polio.
[00:13:51.589 --> 00:13:55.170]  My uncle almost died from a tetanus shot.
[00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:03.233]  I literally know multiple people in this building where the vaccines killed their children.
[00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:03.633]  Killed them!
[00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:07.485]  As in dead!
[00:14:07.485 --> 00:14:10.766]  And still people won't listen to me.
[00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:14.567]  Lou Ferrigno, we'll tell you more about this, but I'm not going to get to it this hour.
[00:14:14.567 --> 00:14:19.968]  So you get into geopolitical stuff and economic things and the UN worldwide funding Marxist style race war.
[00:14:19.968 --> 00:14:20.988]  That's all coming up first.
[00:14:20.988 --> 00:14:25.329]  I'm going to set all the vaccine deaths and illnesses and people paralyzed.
[00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:28.369]  I'm going to set this aside.
[00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.669]  Yeah, you take the pneumonia shot, you get pneumonia.
[00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.270]  You take the flu shot, you get flu.
[00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.650]  Everybody knows this.
[00:14:35.014 --> 00:14:39.937]  My mother was not in professional sports when she was younger.
[00:14:39.937 --> 00:14:43.098]  Didn't start competitively swimming until she was 35.
[00:14:43.098 --> 00:14:47.301]  And then she was on the UT Masters, won silver medals, gold medals at national competitions.
[00:14:47.301 --> 00:14:51.183]  I mean, she was beating former Olympic athletes.
[00:14:51.183 --> 00:14:56.425]  And UT told her at about 43, told them all, take your flu shot.
[00:14:56.425 --> 00:14:58.326]  We've got some big meats coming up.
[00:14:58.326 --> 00:15:01.088]  And she took it and almost killed my mama.
[00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:02.609]  She was in bed for a month.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.184]  She lost 25 pounds and she never came back to where she was ever again.
[00:15:08.184 --> 00:15:19.214]  I warn you again folks, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit somebody that got killed or almost killed by this crap!
[00:15:19.214 --> 00:15:20.635]  So I'm pissed.
[00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:23.558]  And I say it's time to stop playing damn games.
[00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:24.739]  Excuse me.
[00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:27.902]  I see I'm having real angry issues right now and it's not an act.
[00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.705]  And I apologize for using the Lord's name in vain.
[00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:31.906]  I don't intend it as that.
[00:15:31.906 --> 00:15:34.408]  You hear preachers saying, God says you'll be damned to hell.
[00:15:34.408 --> 00:15:40.212]  All I'm saying is, God, please damn these people to hell that know what they're doing.

[00:19:57.516 --> 00:20:03.161]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.783]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.972 --> 00:20:26.034]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:20:26.034 --> 00:20:33.599]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:44.164]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we've got the rat coming clean, Mr. Cohen, one of Trump's disgraced lawyers.
[00:20:54.608 --> 00:21:00.232]  Giving his so-called interview to 60 Minutes, that's going to be coming up.
[00:21:00.232 --> 00:21:07.517]  We're also going to get to, obviously, the massive news of the UN trying to stir up race war all over the planet.
[00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:15.062]  They've got major leaders in South Africa, top politicians, the heads of major parties, saying we will kill their children and women.
[00:21:15.062 --> 00:21:18.625]  Fury over black South African politicians called to kill whites.
[00:21:19.923 --> 00:21:22.644]  We ought to pull up Khalid Mohammed, he's still on YouTube.
[00:21:22.644 --> 00:21:26.925]  We kill the women, we kill the children, we kill the babies!
[00:21:26.925 --> 00:21:31.546]  And you say, why do you kill those little beautiful blonde-haired, blue-eyed babies?
[00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:38.587]  Because every nine months, the white woman lays down on her back, and military enforcements roll out!
[00:21:38.587 --> 00:21:44.469]  So I say, kill them all!
[00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:48.910]  That's what's taught by the Communists in the United States, and that's what's taught by the Communists in South Africa.
[00:21:50.071 --> 00:21:55.273]  And it ties in to even mainstream politico.
[00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:56.794]  All these years later.
[00:21:56.794 --> 00:22:02.477]  Hell, Paul Watson went to several European countries a few years ago and he offered
[00:22:03.402 --> 00:22:08.884]  A huge bounty, a large amount of money, to any mainstream media that would go to these no-go zones.
[00:22:08.884 --> 00:22:12.124]  And when they went there, they found out that, indeed, people tried to kill them.
[00:22:12.124 --> 00:22:15.405]  Now the no-go zones are most areas of cities.
[00:22:15.405 --> 00:22:18.046]  I mean, it's just hellish.
[00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.787]  And here's Politico.
[00:22:19.787 --> 00:22:24.888]  Sweden's violent reality is undoing a peaceful self-image.
[00:22:27.827 --> 00:22:33.031]  But you read it, and it's nothing about it being Muslims, 90% of the crime.
[00:22:33.031 --> 00:22:35.193]  Hilarious.
[00:22:35.193 --> 00:22:36.854]  Wow.
[00:22:36.854 --> 00:22:39.837]  Unbelievable.
[00:22:39.837 --> 00:22:43.620]  So we'll be looking into all that, and this is really the biggest news of the day.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.803]  So I want to spend some time on it coming up.
[00:22:47.803 --> 00:22:54.609]  French generals accuse Macron, and these are acting generals, major generals, and others, of treason.
[00:22:56.033 --> 00:22:59.956]  Over UN Migration Pact.
[00:22:59.956 --> 00:23:01.438]  And they go on to say, that's what it is.
[00:23:01.438 --> 00:23:02.218]  Wow.
[00:23:02.218 --> 00:23:04.600]  No one would talk about the UN Migration Pact two years ago.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.862]  We were talking about it, or six months ago, or a month ago.
[00:23:06.862 --> 00:23:08.564]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:23:08.564 --> 00:23:16.490]  And the French military is saying, we may have to remove you and the public has a right to revolt.
[00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:20.854]  Wait till we get to that.
[00:23:20.854 --> 00:23:24.097]  And oh, the Egyptian president has come out and said,
[00:23:26.002 --> 00:23:46.850]  That the left is organizing Islam into an invasion force to take down Europe, and that Muslims should openly assimilate and decry the leftist alliance with radical forms of Islam like Wahhabism, or that it's going to basically trigger a clash of civilizations.
[00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:47.831]  I mean, he's a good guy.
[00:23:47.831 --> 00:23:49.612]  He's pro-Trump, pro-America.
[00:23:49.612 --> 00:23:52.753]  Egyptian president blast migrants on assimilating in Europe.
[00:23:53.621 --> 00:24:02.228]  And says, they have built superior technology and superior culture, and that we need to adopt it.
[00:24:02.228 --> 00:24:05.690]  Now that's just being honest.
[00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:11.815]  Just like in Egypt 5,000 years ago, people were trying to get in there, because they had superior technology, you need to adopt Egyptian culture.
[00:24:11.815 --> 00:24:19.761]  And so he's telling people, listen, you don't want to ally yourself with the globalists on the left, you're crazy.
[00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.223]  So see, from Russia to Poland,
[00:24:23.524 --> 00:24:27.047]  To the United States, to England, to Brazil, to everywhere.
[00:24:27.047 --> 00:24:28.067]  People are getting it.
[00:24:28.067 --> 00:24:31.850]  Big megacorporations are allied with China and the Communists.
[00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.071]  Radical Islam.
[00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:35.393]  God-hating leftists.
[00:24:35.393 --> 00:24:40.056]  And everybody's going, whoa, we don't want to be part of this.
[00:24:40.056 --> 00:24:41.998]  We don't want to blow up America and Europe.
[00:24:41.998 --> 00:24:44.059]  We're not enemies with you.
[00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:46.261]  We don't want to be played in this game.
[00:24:48.086 --> 00:24:54.388]  So suddenly everything we've talked about in our basic nomenclature, you see, is the speech of the world now.
[00:24:54.388 --> 00:25:09.032]  Our terms, like world government, global governance, new world order, tax-exempt foundations, diplomatic immunity for the UN, carbon taxes, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[00:25:11.854 --> 00:25:13.897]  Weaponize third world populations.
[00:25:13.897 --> 00:25:15.019]  Now it's on.
[00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:19.526]  Because we forced the terms into common use.
[00:25:19.526 --> 00:25:22.391]  And we've exposed how the world really works.
[00:25:22.391 --> 00:25:25.255]  After them stonewalling for decades while they built this monster.
[00:25:26.351 --> 00:25:32.894]  And now, we've got a good chance of beating these people, but we had to admit there was a global criminal government forming.
[00:25:32.894 --> 00:25:34.874]  We had to admit it was allied with radical Islam.
[00:25:34.874 --> 00:25:37.715]  We had to admit they're targeting our children and our families.
[00:25:37.715 --> 00:25:41.277]  It was hard to admit when they were first building it, because who wants to admit this?
[00:25:41.277 --> 00:25:43.058]  It's crazy!
[00:25:43.058 --> 00:25:52.801]  But now that it's emerging, and now that we're really facing it, we now know who the enemy is, and we're going to win.
[00:25:52.801 --> 00:25:54.242]  In fact, look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:25:59.485 --> 00:26:01.866]  Paris police braced for more violent protests.
[00:26:01.866 --> 00:26:17.709]  Now the government admits, you are nationalists, you are French, we've brought in 10 million illegal aliens, they're crapping all over the ground, everything's going bankrupt, we shouldn't have 85% taxes, and the EU says that they're about to fall, that the global order is collapsing.
[00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:21.950]  You mean the global order of breaking the social compact and overrunning our countries and enslaving us?
[00:26:24.997 --> 00:26:31.459]  Yes, that order is in trouble because humanity is now awakening and the process is accelerating.
[00:26:31.459 --> 00:26:39.182]  And there's only a few ways the globalists could stop this now, but I'm going to break those down on the other side.
[00:26:39.182 --> 00:26:44.564]  Next year's news today, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have our reporters there again this weekend on the ground.
[00:26:44.564 --> 00:26:48.446]  Dan Lyman got shot at, saw men and women have their eyes blown out by the French.
[00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:52.142]  I'll stop myself.
[00:26:52.142 --> 00:26:53.663]  Most of them weren't French.
[00:26:53.663 --> 00:27:01.087]  The big blue armored vehicles with the UN controlled EU symbol on it with mercenaries for the first time since 1945.
[00:27:01.087 --> 00:27:03.049]  Foreign troops.
[00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:06.351]  Oh, and one of these generals cite as treason.
[00:27:06.351 --> 00:27:08.352]  And the need to remove the entire traitorous government.
[00:27:09.042 --> 00:27:14.008]  They cite the armored EU vehicles.
[00:27:14.008 --> 00:27:15.870]  See how they hid that in plain view?
[00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:21.416]  Foreign mercs, many of them, on your streets, suppressing you.
[00:27:21.416 --> 00:27:22.237]  Foreign troops.
[00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:25.836]  What did I say?
[00:27:25.836 --> 00:27:37.979]  On Sunday and Monday, foreign troops, treason, France invaded for the first time since World War II by a foreign power, Macron liked the Vichy French, and now, in the letters written by the top generals, they say exactly that.
[00:27:37.979 --> 00:27:39.419]  They didn't get that from me.
[00:27:39.419 --> 00:27:40.440]  They know history.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.360]  They're seeing it happen!
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.541]  You're seeing France being conquered, but not without a shot being fired.
[00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:51.802]  The mercs are there, targeting men and women, shooting them in the face with rubber bullets.
[00:27:53.217 --> 00:27:58.459]  I predict that will cause the violent overthrow of the French government by the military.
[00:27:58.459 --> 00:28:03.080]  And I salute it because it's not the French government.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:08.982]  It's an occupied criminal collaborator group of dirtbags that need to be removed.
[00:28:08.982 --> 00:28:15.324]  And if they continue to struggle and try to sell the country out and lower its defenses and bankrupt it and bring in third world populations to act as their
[00:28:16.064 --> 00:28:19.207]  Political force to burn cities anytime they want?
[00:28:19.207 --> 00:28:29.376]  Then these so-called French leaders who are really collaborators need to be dealt with just like collaborators were dealt with in 1942, 43, 44, and 45.
[00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:32.259]  They need to be swinging from the ends of ropes!
[00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:34.001]  And they will be if they keep pushing it.
[00:28:34.788 --> 00:28:37.630]  Junker, Macron, I'm not threatening them.
[00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:49.478]  I'm telling them, just like Mussolini and Hitler and the Vichy French, Toto and all of them, you're gonna be swinging from the ends of ropes, you little snot-nosed Rothschild sex toy!
[00:28:49.478 --> 00:28:53.740]  So you better know when to back down, you piece of filth!
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.602]  The French are awakening, that's a good thing.
[00:28:56.602 --> 00:28:57.723]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:28:58.905 --> 00:29:00.986]  Offer not valid in all states or where prohibited by law.

[00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:56.821]  79cash.com.
[00:29:56.821 --> 00:30:00.042]  79cash.com.
[00:30:00.042 --> 00:30:01.403]  Everybody knows it.
[00:30:01.403 --> 00:30:03.284]  History documents it.
[00:30:03.284 --> 00:30:06.566]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history.
[00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:08.861]  That wants to hurt children.
[00:30:08.861 --> 00:30:09.982]  They want to abort children.
[00:30:09.982 --> 00:30:11.742]  They want to disease children.
[00:30:11.742 --> 00:30:12.862]  They want to abuse children.
[00:30:12.862 --> 00:30:14.483]  They want to confuse children.
[00:30:14.483 --> 00:30:15.663]  They want their essence.
[00:30:15.663 --> 00:30:16.623]  They want their soul.
[00:30:16.623 --> 00:30:17.943]  They want their spirit.
[00:30:17.943 --> 00:30:19.704]  They want their power.
[00:30:19.704 --> 00:30:21.944]  Because they are our future.
[00:30:21.944 --> 00:30:25.525]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[00:30:25.525 --> 00:30:27.426]  It is about the West.
[00:30:27.426 --> 00:30:31.567]  It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[00:30:31.567 --> 00:30:33.147]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[00:30:34.358 --> 00:30:44.861]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:46.942]  You have the power to override the censors.
[00:30:46.942 --> 00:30:50.603]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[00:30:50.603 --> 00:30:59.086]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[00:31:00.134 --> 00:31:09.179]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:10.520]  We've been proven dead on.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.402]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[00:31:14.402 --> 00:31:19.024]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[00:31:19.024 --> 00:31:20.085]  Words are not enough.
[00:31:20.911 --> 00:31:27.094]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[00:31:27.094 --> 00:31:33.317]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[00:31:33.317 --> 00:31:37.279]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:39.200]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.202]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[00:31:43.769 --> 00:31:49.455]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[00:31:49.455 --> 00:31:50.696]  I am in your hands.
[00:31:50.696 --> 00:31:58.344]  And we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars.
[00:31:58.344 --> 00:31:58.744]  A true 360 win.
[00:31:59.885 --> 00:32:06.273]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:32:06.273 --> 00:32:07.835]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:32:07.835 --> 00:32:12.741]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off, double page rate points.
[00:32:12.741 --> 00:32:15.665]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[00:32:16.205 --> 00:32:18.947]  A free gift with every order.
[00:32:18.947 --> 00:32:27.813]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:31.475]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[00:32:31.475 --> 00:32:35.458]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day.
[00:32:35.458 --> 00:32:39.221]  It's there until it sells out, then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[00:32:39.761 --> 00:32:46.186]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had, so this is a loss leader.
[00:32:46.186 --> 00:32:47.747]  We are losing money on this.
[00:32:47.747 --> 00:32:49.188]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:32:49.188 --> 00:32:52.511]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.
[00:32:52.511 --> 00:32:57.514]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:57.514 --> 00:33:02.998]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[00:33:02.998 --> 00:33:05.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.552 --> 00:33:25.173]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:25.173 --> 00:33:26.734]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.734 --> 00:33:42.623]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live, Friday, worldwide broadcast.
[00:33:42.623 --> 00:33:46.224]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:48.045]  I'm going to plunge right into
[00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:56.201]  The globalist's latest attempt to literally take over and take down the nation states.
[00:33:56.201 --> 00:34:06.285]  Now people are battling back in just an incredible way, but also how the globalists are counter-striking against that and the tactics they're using to stop it.
[00:34:06.285 --> 00:34:13.387]  And some of the other tactics they haven't quite completely used yet that we need to be aware of are in their quiver.
[00:34:13.387 --> 00:34:15.428]  So that's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:18.429]  Tim Frugier and Pat Riley, two of the guys that work here,
[00:34:20.138 --> 00:34:26.563]  Are the guys a lot of times that bring me some Soros Hillary funded lawsuit or you know some new threat.
[00:34:26.563 --> 00:34:30.645]  A lot of times they bring me bad news which I always demand to have immediately.
[00:34:30.645 --> 00:34:32.627]  We're ready to face the day.
[00:34:32.627 --> 00:34:36.329]  Not not stick our heads in the sand in this fight for liberty.
[00:34:36.329 --> 00:34:45.195]  But they came in just about 15 minutes ago during the last break and said hey boss we've got some bad news for you.
[00:34:45.195 --> 00:34:46.056]  Bad news folder.
[00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:50.651]  And I said, what, another lawsuit or something like that, or somebody's dead?
[00:34:50.651 --> 00:34:52.952]  And they said, oh no, it's actually good news.
[00:34:52.952 --> 00:34:53.893]  Here's your present.
[00:34:53.893 --> 00:34:55.775]  So if you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[00:34:55.775 --> 00:34:57.036]  Again, I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:34:57.036 --> 00:34:58.056]  Can we zoom in a little bit more, please?
[00:34:58.056 --> 00:34:58.937]  Thanks.
[00:34:58.937 --> 00:35:09.125]  You can see there that it's Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, and Alex Jones on blue Christmas paper with snowflakes on it.
[00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:15.675]  So, I don't know what this is, but I said, is this kosher for television?
[00:35:15.675 --> 00:35:17.316]  Can I open this on air?
[00:35:17.316 --> 00:35:22.860]  So this is a big surprise, and I'm gonna not make you wait till the end of the show, like other talk shows do, to see what it is.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.801]  I'm going to tear this open.
[00:35:24.801 --> 00:35:27.623]  I had to tell them, I said, is this custom wrapping paper?
[00:35:27.623 --> 00:35:31.966]  And they said, oh yes, it's custom wrapping paper.
[00:35:31.966 --> 00:35:36.049]  So let's see what on earth this is.
[00:35:36.049 --> 00:35:37.550]  I know they seem really excited in there.
[00:35:39.138 --> 00:35:40.199]  Crap.
[00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:42.181]  I just dropped whatever it is behind me.
[00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:43.642]  That just builds the suspense even more.
[00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:46.725]  It just slid out on the ground over there.
[00:35:46.725 --> 00:35:47.426]  Will somebody bring that to me?
[00:35:47.426 --> 00:35:48.747]  Thank you.
[00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:51.550]  So it's two pieces of cardboard with something sandwiched between it.
[00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:52.691]  I'm about to find out what it is.
[00:35:52.691 --> 00:35:56.695]  Thank you very much.
[00:35:56.695 --> 00:36:00.639]  Oh my God.
[00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:03.602]  Okay, it is a Brian Stelter calendar.
[00:36:05.055 --> 00:36:09.239]  And I will not be hanging this in the kitchen because that would cause me to not be able to enjoy my food.
[00:36:09.239 --> 00:36:15.125]  And I certainly won't be hanging it in the gym because that would be depressing.
[00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:18.008]  Maybe I can hang it, like, above the garbage cans in the garage.
[00:36:20.572 --> 00:36:23.574]  Let's zoom out for radio listeners and TV viewers.
[00:36:23.574 --> 00:36:24.274]  Oh my goodness.
[00:36:24.274 --> 00:36:27.175]  So there is his head photoshopped.
[00:36:27.175 --> 00:36:28.816]  Or are these real photos of Brian Stelter?
[00:36:28.816 --> 00:36:30.477]  He really is into himself.
[00:36:30.477 --> 00:36:32.418]  He doesn't know how to... Oh my gosh.
[00:36:32.418 --> 00:36:36.860]  There he is moving a large stump.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.961]  It's a country boy.
[00:36:38.961 --> 00:36:39.782]  Oh my gosh.
[00:36:39.782 --> 00:36:41.402]  What in the hell is that?
[00:36:41.402 --> 00:36:45.645]  Brian Stelter with rose petals on his chest.
[00:36:45.645 --> 00:36:46.485]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:36:46.485 --> 00:36:48.026]  Brian Stelter as a leprechaun.
[00:36:50.965 --> 00:36:52.165]  Oh my gosh, here's another one.
[00:36:52.165 --> 00:36:56.546]  Brian Stelter as a child on Easter.
[00:36:56.546 --> 00:37:00.447]  Brian Stelter having a beer.
[00:37:00.447 --> 00:37:02.568]  Okay, well that is truly hideous.
[00:37:02.568 --> 00:37:06.349]  This obviously is not true.
[00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:08.149]  This is Brian Stelter wrapped in an American flag.
[00:37:08.149 --> 00:37:10.470]  We know he hates America.
[00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:15.291]  Brian Stelter walking around in a backyard.
[00:37:15.291 --> 00:37:16.551]  Brian Stelter as a fireman.
[00:37:18.137 --> 00:37:20.759]  Again, he's in all of these sexy poses here.
[00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:22.860]  Brian Stelter in the pumpkin patch.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.381]  Brian Stelter with a pumpkin pie.
[00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:28.104]  I'm not going to describe for listeners what he's doing with it.
[00:37:28.104 --> 00:37:32.266]  Brian Stelter, again, this is truly hideous.
[00:37:32.266 --> 00:37:36.789]  Okay, guys, you've outdone yourself.
[00:37:36.789 --> 00:37:38.290]  I really feel like I've been assaulted.
[00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:39.171]  Sorry for TV viewers.
[00:37:42.537 --> 00:37:43.577]  This is unbelievable.
[00:37:43.577 --> 00:37:47.839]  Why don't we hang this in one of the conference rooms and actually use it to put notes on?
[00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:51.321]  So it'll let us know and remind us who we're fighting here.
[00:37:51.321 --> 00:37:52.602]  Please, take it away.
[00:37:52.602 --> 00:37:57.964]  That's supposed to cheer me up.
[00:37:57.964 --> 00:37:59.204]  Take him off the screen, please.
[00:37:59.204 --> 00:38:01.465]  We've seen enough of Stelter.
[00:38:01.465 --> 00:38:04.147]  Thank you.
[00:38:04.147 --> 00:38:05.267]  Gotta have some fun around here.
[00:38:05.267 --> 00:38:07.708]  The guys are trying to do that.
[00:38:07.708 --> 00:38:08.309]  Stop!
[00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.829]  Stop!
[00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:09.229]  Stop!
[00:38:09.229 --> 00:38:09.569]  Stop!
[00:38:09.569 --> 00:38:09.849]  Stop!
[00:38:09.849 --> 00:38:10.470]  Stop!
[00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:11.090]  That's enough.
[00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:11.450]  Seriously.
[00:38:13.865 --> 00:38:16.387]  They're having a lot of fun in there.
[00:38:16.387 --> 00:38:18.008]  We're going to have a new t-shirt.
[00:38:18.008 --> 00:38:21.631]  The design just got sent off to our Texas printers.
[00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:24.933]  It'll be out.
[00:38:24.933 --> 00:38:26.174]  It'll be done next week.
[00:38:26.174 --> 00:38:28.916]  We'll have them in by the new year.
[00:38:28.916 --> 00:38:33.920]  But we'll start pre-sales on these next week.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.001]  And then again, you'll get them in the first of the year.
[00:38:36.001 --> 00:38:39.164]  But it is actually warms my heart.
[00:38:41.027 --> 00:38:53.297]  And I'll just tell you, it has to do with Alexandra Cortez, the incredibly hilarious... I mean, she gives Hank Johnson a run for his money for being stupid.
[00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:57.521]  We're gonna have her... Well, let's just say it involves a dog.
[00:38:59.142 --> 00:39:17.647]  And let's just say it involves Trump's tweet that his son put out that she said she's going to have him criminally investigated for and have him subpoenaed to Congress, which is illegal for his political activity, where Trump said, in America, in capitalist countries, we walk our dogs.
[00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:22.309]  In socialist countries like Venezuela, you eat your dogs.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:30.524]  And so since she wants to turn us into Venezuela, in her own words, Bernie Sanders has praised Hugo Chavez Venezuela and praised her.
[00:39:30.524 --> 00:39:41.249]  Since she's done that too, literally, you can say that, you know, chicken in every pot was the saying that FDR had, that everybody would get more food during the Depression.
[00:39:41.249 --> 00:39:42.930]  Chicken in the pot every night.
[00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:48.973]  Well, we're talking about a dog in every pot, is going to be Cortez's slogan.
[00:39:48.973 --> 00:39:50.474]  And just like we said, Hillary for prison,
[00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:53.692]  2016 we launched that meme.
[00:39:53.692 --> 00:39:54.512]  You launched that meme.
[00:39:54.512 --> 00:39:58.513]  It became incredibly powerful and had a massive, massive effect.
[00:39:58.513 --> 00:40:02.034]  We are going to make her head on a dog.
[00:40:02.034 --> 00:40:04.335]  They're going to say you're calling women dogs.
[00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:09.176]  No, just Cortez, a socialist, not a dog.
[00:40:09.176 --> 00:40:13.858]  We're saying we don't want her and her ignorance to be consumed by the socialism she's promoting.
[00:40:13.858 --> 00:40:14.558]  It kind of has that
[00:40:16.403 --> 00:40:20.626]  A pun, or is it a double entendre, or it has a double meaning?
[00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:37.899]  She's a dog, and we're saying, let's not eat the dogs, because it's the people that bring in socialism a lot of times who are idiots like her, and I think she probably believes in it, that don't understand it, and ends up literally destroying them and their country as people eat themselves alive.
[00:40:37.899 --> 00:40:46.145]  Okay, I'm going to get very focused and very serious now, and we're going to go to break, and come back.
[00:40:47.961 --> 00:40:51.402]  And I'm going to get into some good news.
[00:40:51.402 --> 00:40:53.463]  And then I'm going to get into some more good news.
[00:40:53.463 --> 00:40:55.204]  And then I'm going to get into some more good news.
[00:40:55.204 --> 00:40:59.225]  But then I will, I'm a little bit behind, get into the bad news.
[00:40:59.225 --> 00:41:06.307]  How they're striking back, currently, and the other cards they've got in their little hand.
[00:41:06.307 --> 00:41:16.051]  And we think we're winning right now, but if we don't recognize how they can counterpunch, and how they probably will, then we could lose.
[00:41:17.879 --> 00:41:20.620]  And you don't want to lose to these people because they're so bad.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.181]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:41:23.181 --> 00:41:30.264]  Please don't forget, you stand between InfoWars and the Hillary criminal mob and Soros and the Globalists.
[00:41:30.264 --> 00:41:32.905]  They publicly said get InfoWars off the air.
[00:41:32.905 --> 00:41:36.906]  They publicly said shut down their free speech.
[00:41:36.906 --> 00:41:41.048]  They sicked all their systems on us and we're still standing.
[00:41:41.048 --> 00:41:44.389]  And in some ways we're stronger, getting more Aminathem stations, more
[00:41:45.774 --> 00:41:51.297]  More TV stations, more cable stations, more hardcore visitors to newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:41:51.297 --> 00:41:57.739]  But our reach, our tentacles as they would call them, as Ryan Stelter calls them, calls me a virus, a diseased.
[00:41:57.739 --> 00:41:58.460]  I have tentacles.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:06.123]  So I guess if you're an evil globalist, I guess like a child molester would think police coming to bust him would be a bad thing.
[00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:08.524]  I'm not talking about Stelter.
[00:42:08.524 --> 00:42:10.445]  He looks like a child molester, like the archetypal one.
[00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:11.105]  I'm not saying he is.
[00:42:11.105 --> 00:42:14.407]  I'm saying he sees me as a liberty, as a patriot guy, as a bad guy.
[00:42:15.919 --> 00:42:17.820]  So he kind of sees me as a monster, I kind of get that.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:23.103]  Kind of like a pedophile would think the cops busting down their door to save kids in a basement, you know, would be bad as well.
[00:42:23.103 --> 00:42:29.628]  From his perspective, not Stelter, a fictional pedophile, it would be something quite horrifying.
[00:42:29.628 --> 00:42:32.950]  Now, continuing here.
[00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:38.213]  We have the biggest sales of the year running right now on supplements, on books, on water filtration, on DVDs, on
[00:42:40.696 --> 00:42:41.158]  Great.
[00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:42.001]  Patriot Apparel.

[00:44:10.021 --> 00:44:18.728]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:44:18.728 --> 00:44:23.312]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.

[00:44:24.774 --> 00:44:28.297]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:44:28.977 --> 00:44:40.360]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[00:46:04.529 --> 00:46:09.092]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[00:46:09.092 --> 00:46:19.599]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:46:29.267 --> 00:46:30.668]  Double Patriot points.
[00:46:30.668 --> 00:46:33.891]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:38.436]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.

[00:46:56.888 --> 00:47:02.451]  Thank you.
[00:47:02.451 --> 00:47:05.112]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.987 --> 00:47:24.129]  Big Brother.
[00:47:24.129 --> 00:47:25.912]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:25.912 --> 00:47:27.854]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:27.854 --> 00:47:29.517]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:29.517 --> 00:47:31.180]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:35.726]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:38.795 --> 00:47:55.280]  So, I'm not going to sit here and list all the African countries, all the Latin American countries, all the Asian countries, all the European countries, Southern, Eastern, Western, the UK, the US, everywhere, nationalists and patriots are winning almost every election.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.721]  People are awake to world government.
[00:47:56.721 --> 00:48:05.444]  They're awake to how foreign populations of untrained, unskilled people, military-age men, are being brought in and then being kept on welfare.
[00:48:06.638 --> 00:48:15.542]  And being allowed to commit massive crimes as a political detonator that the leftists can activate to burn down cities anytime they want.
[00:48:15.542 --> 00:48:22.705]  But see, the citizens, like the Yellow Vesters spreading worldwide, they can burn things down too.
[00:48:22.705 --> 00:48:32.470]  But instead of burning down the neighborhoods, like the Islamists are ordered to do, and then drive people out and move into those neighborhoods, the French can burn down
[00:48:33.752 --> 00:48:38.576]  The government officials' houses and cars, and in some cases, kill them.
[00:48:38.576 --> 00:48:46.423]  And that's why the French military, some of their top generals and others, have written a letter, currently serving generals, to Macron saying, you have battered our people.
[00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:47.603]  You have squeezed them.
[00:48:47.603 --> 00:48:52.488]  They're on the edge of total revolt, and they have a right to revolt.
[00:48:52.488 --> 00:48:55.610]  And you are involved in, quote, treason.
[00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.672]  Just like the Vichy French were with Hitler.
[00:48:59.261 --> 00:49:12.050]  What is it when you open your borders and announce, come here, everything's free, and then let your people be robbed and killed and raise taxes to pay foreign currency scam, carbon trading bureaus money?
[00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.231]  You are a traitor.
[00:49:13.231 --> 00:49:14.472]  You are a criminal.
[00:49:14.472 --> 00:49:18.835]  French generals accuse Macron of treason over UN migration pact.
[00:49:18.835 --> 00:49:22.237]  Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com.
[00:49:22.237 --> 00:49:27.121]  Open letter says French citizens have another reason to revolt, and that's the globalism.
[00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:34.656]  And the generals mentioned the UN Migration Pact, which says that it circumvents national sovereignty.
[00:49:34.656 --> 00:49:39.859]  Even if a country doesn't want people in, the UN will bring them in.
[00:49:39.859 --> 00:49:46.703]  And the EU army says it will force them in if Italy or Macedonia or Greece don't accept it.
[00:49:46.703 --> 00:49:48.044]  Wow, that is beyond reason.
[00:49:48.044 --> 00:49:50.165]  That's an invasion.
[00:49:50.165 --> 00:49:52.687]  A group of French military generals have written an open letter to a
[00:49:53.635 --> 00:49:56.618]  Manuel Macron accusing the French President of committing treason.
[00:49:56.618 --> 00:49:58.180]  He's not a French President, he's a globalist.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:13.257]  By signing the UN Migration Pact, the pact which was signed by 164 nations on Monday, including France, is not legally binding but greases the skids for unlimited migration to be treated as a human right and criticism of mass migration to be treated as hate speech.
[00:50:14.366 --> 00:50:15.266]  Already banning it in Europe.
[00:50:15.266 --> 00:50:31.754]  A letter written by General Antonio Martinez and signed by 10 other generals, an admiral and a colonel, as well as former French Minister of Defense, Charles Milan, warns Macron that the move strips France of more sovereignty and provides an additional reason for an already battered people to quote revolt.
[00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:57.334]  And you read the letter, it gets hardcore and gets into the treason, and how they're ignoring the laws of the Republic, and how they're gonna bankrupt the nation by design, and the EU is basically scuttling France, and that the UN is doing it, that it's part of a greater Europe project to dominate France, and that the country's going to fall.
[00:50:57.334 --> 00:51:03.679]  And that they're, quote, erasing our civilization.
[00:51:03.679 --> 00:51:05.821]  And they go on to warn him, do not shine
[00:51:09.116 --> 00:51:16.244]  On, even though France says they've adopted, don't sign your own treason warrant.
[00:51:16.244 --> 00:51:23.071]  Meanwhile, Politico admits Sweden has one of the highest crime rates in the world, when just 10 years ago had the lowest crime rate in the world.
[00:51:23.071 --> 00:51:25.753]  And of course, 90% of the crime is the Islamists.
[00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:30.633]  Meanwhile, we'll kill their children and women.
[00:51:30.633 --> 00:51:36.722]  Fury over black South African politician, the leader of one of the biggest parties, calls to kill whites.
[00:51:36.722 --> 00:51:45.514]  South Africans are outraged at the recent speech by local revolutionary socialist politician who called upon his followers to kill white people including women, children, even pets owned by whites.
[00:51:48.132 --> 00:51:59.862]  Andel Mixonama, the leader of the, founder of the pan-Africanist political party, Black First and Land First, BLF, has been repeatedly heard using harsh language.
[00:51:59.862 --> 00:52:02.984]  And of course, right now, the current president talks like that.
[00:52:02.984 --> 00:52:05.847]  And the head of the Communist Party.
[00:52:05.847 --> 00:52:07.928]  You're like, wow, that looks like Antifa outfits they're wearing.
[00:52:07.928 --> 00:52:11.671]  Yes, this is all Marxist crap.
[00:52:11.671 --> 00:52:15.595]  Then once a country's brought down, these people are always killed by the new party that comes in.
[00:52:17.051 --> 00:52:19.773]  But then the resources are stolen by offshore corporations.
[00:52:19.773 --> 00:52:24.295]  The Chinese are funding almost all of this, and that's on record, the Communist Chinese government.
[00:52:24.295 --> 00:52:30.519]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of this individual talking about they will kill their children and women.
[00:52:30.519 --> 00:52:32.220]  Here it is.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.001]  We can fight white people.
[00:52:34.001 --> 00:52:36.762]  We'll kill their children.
[00:52:36.762 --> 00:52:39.264]  We'll kill their women.
[00:52:39.264 --> 00:52:42.826]  We'll kill anything that we find on our way.
[00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:56.979]  We kill the women, we kill the adults, we kill the girls, we kill anything that comes before us.
[00:52:56.979 --> 00:53:02.683]  We are organizing 50,000 RGG soldiers.
[00:53:02.683 --> 00:53:06.466]  You must please sign up.
[00:53:06.466 --> 00:53:08.768]  Sign your name up for being an RGG soldier.
[00:53:21.071 --> 00:53:31.974]  Of course he's using a microphone invented by Western culture and he's wearing Western clothes and he's standing on a stage in these big cities.
[00:53:31.974 --> 00:53:33.975]  There was almost no one in South Africa when the
[00:53:35.137 --> 00:53:37.078]  Dutch showed up 400 years ago.
[00:53:37.078 --> 00:53:42.122]  And then, Africans and others poured in because of the jobs and the money.
[00:53:42.122 --> 00:53:44.744]  And the medicine and the rest of it.
[00:53:44.744 --> 00:53:48.627]  And then now, the murder rate's what, 10 times what it was under apartheid.
[00:53:48.627 --> 00:53:49.827]  I'm not defending apartheid either.
[00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:52.189]  They just figured out one evil for something even worse.
[00:53:52.189 --> 00:53:54.831]  And the whole society's collapsing.
[00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:58.754]  And then you've got the communist pan-African party all over the place.
[00:53:58.754 --> 00:54:04.598]  And once they've driven civilization out of there, the UN, CHICOM funded,
[00:54:07.572 --> 00:54:12.474]  Race-based black parties will then start killing the other blacks.
[00:54:12.474 --> 00:54:14.215]  And then everything will collapse.
[00:54:14.215 --> 00:54:16.376]  The Chinese love that.
[00:54:16.376 --> 00:54:18.037]  Because they don't ever build any infrastructure.
[00:54:18.037 --> 00:54:21.338]  They build their own cities with their own generators, put a fence up.
[00:54:21.338 --> 00:54:23.039]  And then they don't assimilate.
[00:54:23.039 --> 00:54:24.440]  They don't talk to anybody.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.361]  They just take the resources and move out.
[00:54:28.361 --> 00:54:32.823]  Except they are taking criminals who served up to five years in forced labor.
[00:54:32.823 --> 00:54:36.005]  They're telling them, we will dump you out in Africa.
[00:54:37.375 --> 00:54:43.803]  So they landed airfields and they just dumped criminals out, kind of like they did, the British did to colonize Australia.
[00:54:43.803 --> 00:54:45.705]  But all of those weren't real criminals, obviously.
[00:54:45.705 --> 00:54:48.068]  A lot of these Chinese probably aren't real criminals either.
[00:54:48.068 --> 00:54:49.169]  It's just one hell of a deal.
[00:54:51.038 --> 00:54:57.344]  I mean, China is taking Africa over, and man, the Chinese are the most... They're great people.
[00:54:57.344 --> 00:54:58.945]  My sister's Korean-adopted.
[00:54:58.945 --> 00:55:00.827]  The Koreans hate the Chinese.
[00:55:00.827 --> 00:55:03.790]  The Chinese hate the Koreans even more than they hate the Japanese.
[00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:06.792]  And the Japanese absolutely hate the Chinese.
[00:55:06.792 --> 00:55:09.235]  And the Vietnamese hate the Chinese more than anybody.
[00:55:09.235 --> 00:55:10.576]  They had like five wars with them.
[00:55:12.537 --> 00:55:15.038]  But no one even knows all this.
[00:55:15.038 --> 00:55:15.679]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:21.121]  The Southern Poverty Law Center this year said there's the dangerous myth of white genocide in South Africa.
[00:55:21.121 --> 00:55:31.106]  Oh, we only saw a bunch of other countries have all the whites driven out and mass murder in Zimbabwe and all these other places.
[00:55:31.106 --> 00:55:33.488]  But the SPLC, why?
[00:55:33.488 --> 00:55:35.889]  They say there's no no-go zones in Europe.
[00:55:35.889 --> 00:55:38.270]  They say there's no sexual mutilation.
[00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:39.671]  They say there's nothing happening.
[00:55:41.553 --> 00:55:47.517]  I say, if you don't let your five-year-old get told he's really a girl, if he's a boy, or vice versa, you're bad too.
[00:55:47.517 --> 00:55:52.620]  Just let men, dressed like women, come talk to your kids in school about their sexuality.
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.361]  If they did it at the park, they'd get arrested.
[00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:59.084]  But if the school sanctions it, you don't want the Southern Poverty Law Center to talk bad about you, do you?
[00:55:59.084 --> 00:56:02.906]  Alright, I'll get more into it in the next hour and open the phones up, but let me just tell you.
[00:56:04.428 --> 00:56:10.890]  Look, we're winning against this evil worldwide, but you see the globalist Marxist angle they use to destabilize of race war.
[00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.230]  They're trying it in Europe, they're trying it here.
[00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:16.891]  And they don't have a big enough population for race war, they import it.
[00:56:16.891 --> 00:56:17.892]  How are they countering it?
[00:56:17.892 --> 00:56:18.732]  With censorship?
[00:56:18.732 --> 00:56:21.073]  With calling you racist if you say no to it?
[00:56:21.073 --> 00:56:24.053]  If you say your nation even exists, you're bad?
[00:56:24.053 --> 00:56:26.314]  The racist groups they're organizing are just cannon fodder.
[00:56:26.314 --> 00:56:27.854]  They're just useful idiots.
[00:56:27.854 --> 00:56:29.295]  But they're also targeting
[00:56:30.503 --> 00:56:38.525]  They're also targeting the people that speak up and tell the truth, and presidents like President Trump and others, for destruction.
[00:56:38.525 --> 00:56:58.531]  They know they can't stop the wave of awakening all over the world, so instead they just want to pick off all the leadership of it, of any type of populist nationalist movement, so it can never actually then deliver the goods, by turning culture and society around, bringing in people that want to assimilate into Western culture and free market, and moving forward into
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.622]  The next level of human development.
[00:57:01.622 --> 00:57:12.455]  Instead, they decided on a post-industrial world of haves and have-nots, giant underclass, a tiny ruling technocracy class, who then basically brings in a worldwide tyranny.
[00:57:13.769 --> 00:57:21.532]  Then allowing the remnants of the West to then sign on to a mass genocide program to wipe out the entire third world population.
[00:57:21.532 --> 00:57:28.814]  That'll be about 9 billion when the main extermination plan is released, according to my analysis and timelines.
[00:57:28.814 --> 00:57:29.835]  So that's the plan.
[00:57:29.835 --> 00:57:38.618]  I'm trying to not move to the level when the robot drones are going to release something like weaponized mouthpots with a 99% kill rate over South Africa.
[00:57:39.278 --> 00:57:44.962]  But the bases in many areas have already been built, and we're looking at fifth generation delivery systems.
[00:57:44.962 --> 00:57:46.503]  These aren't your grandpa's helicopters.
[00:57:52.797 --> 00:57:58.519]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:58.519 --> 00:58:06.383]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.383 --> 00:58:09.544]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:58:09.744 --> 00:58:15.006]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:58:15.006 --> 00:58:17.786]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:58:17.786 --> 00:58:26.789]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:58:26.869 --> 00:58:32.232]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[00:58:56.258 --> 00:58:58.099]  So let's say it short and sweet.
[00:58:58.099 --> 00:59:00.441]  We need your support now, more than ever.
[00:59:00.441 --> 00:59:03.303]  You've come through a thousand times, so I'm not bitching at you.
[00:59:03.303 --> 00:59:06.286]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[00:59:06.286 --> 00:59:10.129]  The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential.
[00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:11.950]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[00:59:12.771 --> 00:59:25.197]  But I know, and God has really put it on my heart, that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[00:59:25.197 --> 00:59:27.118]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[00:59:27.118 --> 00:59:28.498]  I need to be provisioned.
[00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:32.820]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:33.681]  But I need your prayers.
[00:59:33.681 --> 00:59:35.562]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[00:59:35.562 --> 00:59:37.542]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[00:59:37.542 --> 00:59:38.283]  We make it easy.
[00:59:38.843 --> 00:59:40.225]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:12.089]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:00:12.089 --> 01:00:13.511]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:37.446 --> 01:00:43.392]  I intend to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:43.392 --> 01:00:48.917]  Then Matt Bracken will be hosting the fourth hour today, always doing an amazing job.
[01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:55.364]  Let me finish up with what I got to and what I covered in the last segment.
[01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:59.348]  And then we're going to go to break and I'm going to shift gears and get into a bunch of other stories we haven't got into yet.
[01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:11.190]  Most of the time in history, when you get kicked by massive developments, people don't recognize it till later.
[01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:12.751]  That's an understatement.
[01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:19.416]  And victors write the history as well, but science took over in the last 200 years.
[01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:22.379]  There's been good parts of science and then bad parts, the way it's been used.
[01:01:23.564 --> 01:01:37.391]  And the way people were kept in the dark and how the black box nature of technology that you can hide Trojan horses into it or a lot of technology that's adopted supposedly has one use, but really it has a whole nother use.
[01:01:37.391 --> 01:01:39.993]  And you're just a cog within that.
[01:01:39.993 --> 01:01:45.836]  Just like Google and Apple and all the rest of it.
[01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:51.919]  But this diabolical world government system has something going for it.
[01:01:53.703 --> 01:02:01.646]  It's so horrible, it's so evil, it's so over the top, that people really have trouble grasping it.
[01:02:01.646 --> 01:02:15.010]  But that's also its weakness if people ever do begin to grasp it, and if it ever becomes interesting for people to learn how it works, like you learn how football works, you learn how baseball works.
[01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:18.391]  Men can learn all that complex stuff, or women know all about their favorite sitcom,
[01:02:20.626 --> 01:02:27.790]  Maybe they're into clothing or flowers or whatever it is, people, motorcycles.
[01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:49.962]  But if people ever got into how things really work, and the different thought processes and the different philosophies in world history, and that one of the dominant philosophies was developed by Plato, the chief philosopher of all time, the fount,
[01:02:51.766 --> 01:02:56.769]  That you would know that Plato was basically like Adolf Hitler.
[01:02:56.769 --> 01:03:03.112]  In fact, most of what Adolf Hitler talked about and did came from Plato.
[01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:07.034]  And Friedrich Nietzsche, who Hitler got a lot of stuff from, who got it from Plato.
[01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:08.234]  Plato.
[01:03:08.234 --> 01:03:08.955]  Not Plato.
[01:03:08.955 --> 01:03:12.837]  Plato.
[01:03:12.837 --> 01:03:18.700]  But you have to understand, the globalists have bet that you're going to lay down.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.781]  And they've got to be stopped themselves because
[01:03:23.203 --> 01:03:44.320]  They're the most unhappy, wicked, out of control people who think humanity is obsolete because they deep down hate themselves and they are projecting, they are projecting that onto us.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.023]  Now we can talk about some of the things they could pull
[01:03:48.479 --> 01:03:50.961]  To get nationalism back under their control.
[01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:56.524]  Economic world collapse, they're already trying that, admitting that's their plan.
[01:03:56.524 --> 01:03:58.065]  Race war, they're already doing that.
[01:03:58.065 --> 01:04:15.536]  Attacking leaders like Trump, myself, and Tucker Carlson, anybody else that's willing to walk the line for the Republic, walk the line for our nations, walk the line for real renaissance and real open free societies.
[01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:22.410]  And they're going to organize the political systems into a bullying machine to bully you.
[01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:25.422]  And their social credit score.
[01:04:25.422 --> 01:04:30.706]  And systems to not just censor you but punish you because you don't submit to them.
[01:04:30.706 --> 01:04:37.871]  But what everyone has to understand is the current fake leftist Marxist order is only what they use to overthrow things.
[01:04:37.871 --> 01:04:53.041]  What comes in after it is far worse and the people that are being agitated to act as the cannon fodder for this need to understand with 100% certainty that they're useful idiots and that they are going to be the number one enemy of the globalists if their operation succeeds.
[01:04:54.141 --> 01:04:54.662]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:12.717 --> 01:05:21.863]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:21.863 --> 01:05:27.206]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:05:27.206 --> 01:05:29.488]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:05:29.488 --> 01:05:32.610]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:34.471]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:05:34.471 --> 01:05:38.473]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:05:38.473 --> 01:05:40.674]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:40.674 --> 01:05:42.235]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:05:42.235 --> 01:05:44.216]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.216 --> 01:05:46.757]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:46.757 --> 01:05:51.760]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:57.123]  InfoWareStore.com, InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods, powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:06:10.106 --> 01:06:14.488]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:14.488 --> 01:06:28.556]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:28.556 --> 01:06:29.416]  It's Friday!
[01:06:38.067 --> 01:06:40.908]  December 14th, 2018.
[01:06:40.908 --> 01:06:45.729]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:06:45.729 --> 01:06:46.209]  to 3 p.m.
[01:06:46.209 --> 01:06:48.209]  Central.
[01:06:48.209 --> 01:06:51.750]  Then we've got The War Room with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone.
[01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:54.311]  Don't forget David Knight.
[01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:55.611]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:58.752]  with The David Knight Show.
[01:06:58.752 --> 01:07:00.572]  Well, Donald Trump was proven right again.
[01:07:00.572 --> 01:07:03.733]  He said, if you vote for the Democrats in the midterms, which we really didn't do, but
[01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:06.771]  They stole enough of the elections to get the House.
[01:07:06.771 --> 01:07:07.491]  That's clear.
[01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:09.172]  They got caught all over the country.
[01:07:09.172 --> 01:07:18.756]  He said, if they get into office, they're announcing more regulations and the Federal Reserve is going to seem as weak and they're going to raise interest rates some more and that's going to kill the recovery.
[01:07:18.756 --> 01:07:25.359]  And the Democrats are siding with China in the trade war to screw us over.
[01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:30.921]  Just as Ross Perot warned us so many years ago.
[01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:32.902]  And so, now to
[01:07:34.241 --> 01:07:42.587]  An insult to industry, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down another 400 points amid rising fears over global warming.
[01:07:42.587 --> 01:07:49.151]  And the Federal Reserve has announced that they are going to raise interest rates more.
[01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:51.493]  And the Dow is down 419 points.
[01:07:51.493 --> 01:07:56.837]  Oh, but the Fed said they won't raise it as much as they were before.
[01:07:56.837 --> 01:07:58.418]  Well, the damage has already been done.
[01:07:58.418 --> 01:08:00.099]  So I want to get to Pelosi saying that
[01:08:02.284 --> 01:08:10.257]  She'll shut the government down forever before we build a wall to stop all the human smuggling of MS-13.
[01:08:10.257 --> 01:08:11.740]  After all, she called them God's children.
[01:08:13.581 --> 01:08:15.122]  Because it's her program.
[01:08:15.122 --> 01:08:18.185]  It's the same as in Europe, flooding them with military-age men.
[01:08:18.185 --> 01:08:21.128]  They're bringing in the outside group loyal to them.
[01:08:21.128 --> 01:08:29.715]  The Democrats have lawyers that skim the money off of the drug gangs, and off of the mules, and off of the people human trafficking.
[01:08:29.715 --> 01:08:34.479]  I read the Texas News, folks, and I see it every few months in a Texas town.
[01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:41.045]  They bust the police chief, or the mayor, or the mayor's brother, or a city councilwoman.
[01:08:42.236 --> 01:08:51.688]  And it's only when the people they're smuggling get found dead in the back of an 18-wheeler or dead in their basement.
[01:08:51.688 --> 01:09:00.099]  Yeah, well, it was the mayor's brother a few years ago in Austin got caught with half beaten to death, families chained up in his Austin basement.
[01:09:00.099 --> 01:09:01.221]  It's a family business!
[01:09:03.288 --> 01:09:31.020]  And what they do is, once they get these people in here, they don't have any papers, they don't have anybody to protect them, they're all scared to talk to anybody, and so, you have, whether it's Asian gangs, or whether it is Hispanic gangs, or Nigerian gangs, they get the people in here, or Muslim gangs, they get the people in, and then they are an underclass they control, for human trafficking, everything else, so it's so blood-sucking.
[01:09:32.227 --> 01:09:36.252]  You know, the big thing they do is they'll have a factory.
[01:09:36.252 --> 01:09:37.053]  This is what the Muslims do.
[01:09:37.053 --> 01:09:39.476]  There's a lot of famous cases of this.
[01:09:39.476 --> 01:09:46.845]  They'll have a factory, a dairy, a place that processes leather.
[01:09:46.845 --> 01:09:47.706]  There's a lot of these.
[01:09:47.706 --> 01:09:50.349]  And they'll bring in the people on their work visas.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:10:04.143]  They control them, the Imam watches them, they work in the factory, and then they're all told, get on welfare, and that welfare is given back to the Imam and back to the Democrats, to then run people for political office, and they skim the money.
[01:10:04.143 --> 01:10:06.943]  And this is what they left in the third world, they're totally used to this.
[01:10:06.943 --> 01:10:14.905]  So, we need the Justice Department to bust these folks, and by the way, it has exploded under Trump, but it hardly gets any coverage.
[01:10:17.042 --> 01:10:18.523]  You know something else?
[01:10:18.523 --> 01:10:20.244]  It's a history lesson here.
[01:10:20.244 --> 01:10:28.809]  We forget that Trump got rid of the exemption on property taxes on million dollars and more.
[01:10:28.809 --> 01:10:33.152]  Why do you think real estate is so expensive in blue cities and blue states?
[01:10:33.152 --> 01:10:41.657]  Why is real estate 10 times, 20 times what it is, say, in Dallas, Texas?
[01:10:41.657 --> 01:10:46.320]  Because they allow an exemption for property tax off of income tax.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.625]  So people launder their money through the high property tax.
[01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:56.369]  It never goes back out on the real tax rolls to the federal government.
[01:10:56.369 --> 01:11:00.753]  It goes to Democrat-controlled cities who then use that massive war chest.
[01:11:00.753 --> 01:11:07.399]  I mean, on average, Democrat-controlled cities around this country have property taxes.
[01:11:07.399 --> 01:11:12.024]  I mean, Austin has the highest property taxes in the state by a long shot, and they're Democrats.
[01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.659]  And that's how they run their scam.
[01:11:16.659 --> 01:11:18.600]  But oh, they all have a tax exemption.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:25.764]  They all have a charity that their house is in, and the helicopter's in, and the Mercedes is in.
[01:11:25.764 --> 01:11:29.987]  These Democrats don't pay a dime ever.
[01:11:29.987 --> 01:11:33.109]  They've got Mexicans chained up in the basement.
[01:11:33.109 --> 01:11:35.170]  That's what they've got.
[01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:41.014]  How many times have you seen the UN with diplomatic immunity and they find a couple trunks with dead women in them?
[01:11:42.438 --> 01:11:56.229]  How many times has a woman run crying out in Manhattan with blood pouring down her back and her teeth knocked out and they deliver the woman back to the UN official?
[01:11:56.229 --> 01:12:00.313]  I've probably seen articles like that in 23 years on air.
[01:12:00.313 --> 01:12:05.537]  Maybe 800, a thousand times.
[01:12:05.537 --> 01:12:07.198]  But it's always just a little footnote.
[01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:08.039]  And I've talked to cops.
[01:12:10.945 --> 01:12:15.208]  In DC and in New York and in Houston, there's a lot of embassies.
[01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:18.630]  They call them consulates.
[01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:20.511]  If it's not the main national one.
[01:12:20.511 --> 01:12:23.113]  And they go, oh yeah, routinely.
[01:12:23.113 --> 01:12:23.894]  Routinely.
[01:12:23.894 --> 01:12:30.098]  There's this Chinese delegates are driving around with whole trunks full of cocaine.
[01:12:31.263 --> 01:12:39.089]  And they'll be drunk driving and run over somebody and the cops get there and they just jump out and flash the diplomatic immunity and the police can't do a thing.
[01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:45.814]  See, that's what globalism is.
[01:12:45.814 --> 01:12:49.276]  A global superclass above the law.
[01:12:49.276 --> 01:12:52.919]  The UN, all over the world, owns the diplomatically immune aircraft.
[01:12:52.919 --> 01:12:56.802]  They have paramilitary forces and in every country they operate.
[01:12:58.735 --> 01:13:03.760]  They smuggle children and women.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:13.789]  And when they get caught, when the woman escapes, in Saudi Arabia or wherever, it doesn't even make the news.
[01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.030]  Now do you understand?
[01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:19.595]  The UN and this whole collection and leftists in every country run the same scams.
[01:13:21.394 --> 01:13:29.576]  They've brought in 15 million people, most of military age men, the last six, seven years to Europe, and 90 plus percent are still on welfare.
[01:13:29.576 --> 01:13:35.817]  They're not allowed to get jobs, and they just pay a skim to the local socialist.
[01:13:35.817 --> 01:13:37.298]  That's why they're so hard to beat.
[01:13:37.298 --> 01:13:45.239]  They've got the money, and they're criminal, and they'll do anything.
[01:13:45.239 --> 01:13:48.000]  So Trump, even though it hurt his businesses and his properties,
[01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:54.923]  Trump's lost $2 billion, it's reported, just since he got in office and ran.
[01:13:54.923 --> 01:14:05.671]  But Trump took away most of his exemptions on income tax because he wanted to burn the Democrats and the Blue Staters.
[01:14:05.671 --> 01:14:07.913]  And he's costing them.
[01:14:07.913 --> 01:14:10.295]  It's record taxes coming in, and it's because of that.
[01:14:10.295 --> 01:14:15.939]  In fact, some numbers are it's over $50 billion since he got that repealed.
[01:14:17.598 --> 01:14:22.662]  $50 billion that Democrat blue state people have had to pay.
[01:14:22.662 --> 01:14:26.225]  I love it.
[01:14:26.225 --> 01:14:32.210]  I love it.
[01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:34.432]  It's beautiful.
[01:14:34.432 --> 01:14:36.314]  Trump is vengeance.
[01:14:36.314 --> 01:14:39.697]  That's why they hate him so bad and say he's so ineffective and he's such an idiot.
[01:14:39.697 --> 01:14:41.839]  And everyone then repeats it and thinks they're smart.
[01:14:41.839 --> 01:14:43.961]  They say Trump's an idiot, even so-called conservatives.
[01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:52.913]  Trump's done incredible things with almost no one around him that'll actually work with him.
[01:14:52.913 --> 01:15:00.796]  So my support of Trump is not just some ass-kissing contest because all I get is hate and lawsuits and demonization for standing with President Trump.
[01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:04.257]  But I do it because he's standing with his word and doing the best job he can.
[01:15:04.257 --> 01:15:09.639]  But the bad news is, we'll come back and play all the clips, is that he's surrounded by such traitors.
[01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:14.001]  He's been given a multi-thousand page NAFTA agreement, renegotiation NAFTA-GATT agreement.
[01:15:15.452 --> 01:15:16.693]  That has Law of the Sea, U.N.
[01:15:16.693 --> 01:15:18.415]  crap in it.
[01:15:18.415 --> 01:15:25.521]  It has the end of free speech codified in it, the end of Section 230.
[01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:29.004]  It's really bad, and it'll be stripped out in ratification.
[01:15:29.004 --> 01:15:33.788]  But that's why the left wants control of Congress, because they want to just ram all this stuff through.
[01:15:36.895 --> 01:15:42.161]  And Trump's dropped the ball on fighting vaccines, but the point is, is he's not Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:42.161 --> 01:15:43.963]  And that's why they want to take him out.
[01:15:43.963 --> 01:15:53.714]  All right, we're going to play the clips when we come back of the situation with the border, and a little clip about how Ross Perot was right on the other side about the giant sucking sound.
[01:15:53.714 --> 01:15:55.016]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:15:57.256 --> 01:15:58.456]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.456 --> 01:16:03.838]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:03.838 --> 01:16:06.739]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:06.739 --> 01:16:10.320]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:17.902]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:16:26.812 --> 01:16:33.155]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:36.197]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.197 --> 01:16:41.760]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.904]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:45.904 --> 01:16:47.185]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:48.186]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:54.732]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire, by James Dunn.
[01:16:54.732 --> 01:16:56.754]  Available at Amazon Books.

[01:17:58.496 --> 01:18:02.958]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:07.521]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:18.027]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:21.869]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[01:18:21.869 --> 01:18:23.390]  All the sales the last 12 days
[01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:26.613]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off is back.
[01:18:26.613 --> 01:18:27.694]  Free shipping is still there.
[01:18:27.694 --> 01:18:29.096]  Double Patriot points.
[01:18:29.096 --> 01:18:32.340]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:36.865]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[01:18:36.865 --> 01:18:38.326]  Just go check out the sales.
[01:18:38.326 --> 01:18:39.628]  There's too many to break them all down.
[01:18:39.628 --> 01:18:43.452]  Get your orders in by the 19th so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[01:18:44.193 --> 01:18:46.214]  And thank you again all for your support.
[01:18:46.214 --> 01:18:50.655]  We're extending this sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:18:50.655 --> 01:18:55.317]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com, and we're going to beat the Globals together.
[01:18:55.317 --> 01:18:57.678]  Thank you.
[01:18:57.678 --> 01:19:04.080]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.640]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.542]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50 to 75% off double Patriot points.
[01:19:10.542 --> 01:19:13.463]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[01:19:14.003 --> 01:19:16.745]  A free gift with every order.
[01:19:16.745 --> 01:19:25.612]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:19:25.612 --> 01:19:29.274]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[01:19:29.274 --> 01:19:34.638]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[01:19:34.638 --> 01:19:37.000]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:42.442]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:19:42.442 --> 01:19:43.982]  So this is a loss leader.
[01:19:43.982 --> 01:19:45.543]  We are losing money on this.
[01:19:45.543 --> 01:19:46.983]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:19:46.983 --> 01:19:50.325]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.
[01:19:50.325 --> 01:19:55.307]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:55.307 --> 01:20:00.929]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:03.590]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.849 --> 01:20:21.350]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:24.452]  But it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:28.014]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.014 --> 01:20:29.675]  So it's really simple.
[01:20:29.675 --> 01:20:33.837]  There's a big private corporate world government with diplomatic immunity above the law.
[01:20:33.837 --> 01:20:36.119]  They can rape and kill women and children.
[01:20:36.119 --> 01:20:38.780]  They can ship drugs anywhere they want.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.922]  They can even kill police officers inside people's countries.
[01:20:41.922 --> 01:20:43.363]  They have just total control.
[01:20:44.967 --> 01:20:47.449]  In third world nations, the UN runs.
[01:20:47.449 --> 01:20:50.192]  Now they want control here.
[01:20:50.192 --> 01:20:57.878]  Remember, David Rockefeller's father had the plan for the UN to trick nations into a private corporate global government.
[01:20:57.878 --> 01:21:02.142]  So they donated the land.
[01:21:02.142 --> 01:21:09.729]  They can basically come into the nations and do whatever they want once they've removed that national sovereignty.
[01:21:13.004 --> 01:21:23.148]  And so they have the Democratic Party, the leftist parties, and all the countries clamoring for no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:21:23.148 --> 01:21:37.054]  Once the wages are driven down in the First World Nation, it doesn't really drive them up the Third World Nation, then the Third World is migrated into the First World and you have one giant underclass you control.
[01:21:37.054 --> 01:21:40.275]  And I know the listeners understand this, but this is the global fight.
[01:21:41.638 --> 01:22:04.231]  And so Macron and Merkel and others, despite the fact that it's incredibly unpopular, despite the fact that it destroys the nations and bankrupts the pension funds, they bring in the most ignorant, the most unwashed, the most easily influenceable groups of people to literally be the political muscle.
[01:22:06.215 --> 01:22:10.258]  But remember, you can see the French now burning down key targets.
[01:22:10.258 --> 01:22:14.160]  It has the same effect as the leftists.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:21.565]  But the nationalists, the right-wing, the Christians, the conservatives, and that's what makes up the white knights of this whole thing.
[01:22:21.565 --> 01:22:24.447]  That's what makes up the yellow vest.
[01:22:24.447 --> 01:22:31.171]  They're targeting globalists, and globalist shops, and globalist companies, and leftist groups, and leftist government.
[01:22:33.171 --> 01:22:34.432]  And that's the checkmate.
[01:22:34.432 --> 01:22:39.494]  Oh, you can bring in the Muslims and have them burn down our neighborhoods if we don't do what you want?
[01:22:39.494 --> 01:22:42.235]  How about we burn you down?
[01:22:42.235 --> 01:22:45.056]  And top French generals have written letters saying you're guilty of treason.
[01:22:45.056 --> 01:22:49.077]  Do not continue signing on to the UN compact to open our borders further.
[01:22:49.077 --> 01:22:51.979]  This is part of a larger globalist plan and we are done.
[01:22:51.979 --> 01:22:55.240]  You are in danger of being arrested and the public has a right to revolt.
[01:22:57.796 --> 01:22:59.437]  Some of those are current top generals.
[01:22:59.437 --> 01:23:01.098]  That's how far this has gone.
[01:23:01.098 --> 01:23:02.479]  But that's what globalism is.
[01:23:02.479 --> 01:23:04.860]  Globalism is treason.
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:11.744]  Against your nation, against common sense, against everything.
[01:23:11.744 --> 01:23:13.765]  It's how you're conquered in the 21st century.
[01:23:13.765 --> 01:23:16.066]  And Ross Perot was 100% right back in the debates in 1992.
[01:23:16.066 --> 01:23:16.726]  Ross Perot was right.
[01:23:22.443 --> 01:23:25.004]  Well, I think the question was... It'll only take a minute to kill it, Snake.
[01:23:25.004 --> 01:23:26.705]  Go ahead.
[01:23:26.705 --> 01:23:28.486]  Go ahead, kill it.
[01:23:28.486 --> 01:23:30.748]  You're talking about the question, not me, right?
[01:23:30.748 --> 01:23:31.088]  No.
[01:23:31.088 --> 01:23:33.689]  Do you guys ever do anything but propaganda?
[01:23:33.689 --> 01:23:34.810]  Isn't it your business also?
[01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:36.831]  Would you even know the truth if you saw it?
[01:23:36.831 --> 01:23:38.032]  Oh, yes, I... I don't believe you would.
[01:23:38.032 --> 01:23:43.034]  A lot of us remember the debate between Al Gore, who was then Vice President, and Ross Perot.
[01:23:43.034 --> 01:23:45.656]  Ross Perot was fiercely against NAFTA.
[01:23:45.656 --> 01:23:49.658]  Knowing what we know now, was Ross Perot right?
[01:23:55.865 --> 01:23:57.846]  All I can remember from that is a bunch of charts.
[01:23:57.846 --> 01:24:01.527]  So, President Bush, I think you said it earlier.
[01:24:01.527 --> 01:24:02.448]  A new world order.
[01:24:02.448 --> 01:24:02.788]  Let's go.
[01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:04.549]  And I think the first question is over here.
[01:24:16.345 --> 01:24:19.667]  Yes, I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perreault.
[01:24:19.667 --> 01:24:32.535]  What will you do as president to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business and to stop unfair competition here at home from foreign countries so that we can bring jobs back to the United States?
[01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:36.451]  That's right at the top of my agenda.
[01:24:36.451 --> 01:24:56.823]  We've shipped millions of jobs overseas, and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while, you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts, and then go back out.
[01:24:56.823 --> 01:24:58.684]  To those of you in the audience who are business people,
[01:24:59.847 --> 01:25:00.848]  Pretty simple.
[01:25:00.848 --> 01:25:11.374]  If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young 25... Let's assume you've been in business for a long time.
[01:25:11.374 --> 01:25:13.095]  You've got a mature workforce.
[01:25:13.095 --> 01:25:15.697]  Pay $1 an hour for your labor.
[01:25:15.697 --> 01:25:16.718]  Have no health care.
[01:25:16.718 --> 01:25:19.659]  That's the most expensive single element in making a car.
[01:25:19.659 --> 01:25:23.582]  Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:31.028]  And you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.
[01:25:31.028 --> 01:25:38.939]  So, if the people send me to Washington, the first thing I'll do is study that 2,000-page agreement and make sure it's a two-way street.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.561]  I, one last point here.
[01:25:41.561 --> 01:25:48.367]  I've called, I've decided I was dumb and didn't understand it, so I called the who's who of the folks who've been around it, and I said, why won't everybody go south?
[01:25:48.367 --> 01:25:49.447]  They said, we'll be disruptive.
[01:25:49.447 --> 01:25:50.308]  I said, for how long?
[01:25:50.308 --> 01:25:54.651]  I finally got them up for 12 to 15 years, and I said, well how does it stop being disruptive?
[01:25:54.651 --> 01:26:04.439]  And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, then it's leveled again, but in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.
[01:26:04.439 --> 01:26:05.760]  We gotta cut it out.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.181]  Now you've inherited our problems!
[01:26:07.181 --> 01:26:07.922]  We didn't listen!
[01:26:07.922 --> 01:26:09.223]  We, we didn't listen!
[01:26:09.921 --> 01:26:19.967]  And here we are, 25, 26, 27, 28 years later, 28 years later, 28 years later, wow.
[01:26:19.967 --> 01:26:23.309]  And it all came true just like Ross Perot said, because it was a plan.
[01:26:23.309 --> 01:26:29.333]  It's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the globalist statements, it's in CFR reports written 50 years ago.
[01:26:29.333 --> 01:26:31.775]  They wanted to get rid of the first world.
[01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:35.957]  Civilization is about having high wages and quality.
[01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:38.759]  Civilization is about building an infrastructure for people.
[01:26:40.421 --> 01:26:55.351]  But by setting it up where we did one-sided deals with the third world, we didn't help them, we only helped transfer our industry and jobs to those countries so the globalists could then have the first world sue for peace.
[01:26:55.351 --> 01:26:58.693]  Once we'd been turned into a, remember what it was gonna be back then?
[01:26:58.693 --> 01:27:03.416]  We're gonna be a service economy in Europe and the US and Canada and Australia.
[01:27:03.416 --> 01:27:06.618]  And now you like that service economy?
[01:27:06.618 --> 01:27:09.760]  Millennials are paid half of what their parents were paid.
[01:27:13.464 --> 01:27:17.106]  And the folks older than that were paid more than that generation.
[01:27:17.106 --> 01:27:18.946]  And now we have less savings?
[01:27:18.946 --> 01:27:20.247]  Oh, and what do the millennials want?
[01:27:20.247 --> 01:27:24.889]  They want socialism or communism, 50 plus percent.
[01:27:24.889 --> 01:27:31.632]  They've been brainwashed now and actually in the final phase, see as we collapse, they think having everything free will fix it.
[01:27:31.632 --> 01:27:33.832]  No, it'll turn you into Venezuela.
[01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:37.434]  So we're not just becoming poor, we're becoming mentally ignorant.
[01:27:38.717 --> 01:27:40.177]  And Pelosi?
[01:27:40.177 --> 01:27:48.099]  Well, she says if you even want the physical wall to stop the collapse of the third world, why, transferring all our jobs down there was supposed to fix it!
[01:27:48.099 --> 01:27:52.020]  She says if you even want that, you can't have it, and she'll shut the government down forever.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.841]  Well, good lady, because you're shutting the country down forever.
[01:27:54.841 --> 01:27:56.221]  Here she is.
[01:27:56.221 --> 01:27:58.222]  Do you think he changes his calibration?
[01:27:58.222 --> 01:28:04.023]  Even if you're able to pass a bill under your watch on the 3rd of January, his position ostensibly wouldn't change.
[01:28:04.023 --> 01:28:05.944]  Why would he sign that bill to open government up
[01:28:07.006 --> 01:28:10.727]  Does he want to have government closed forever?
[01:28:10.727 --> 01:28:13.689]  I mean, what's this about?
[01:28:13.689 --> 01:28:15.409]  I know he doesn't believe in government.
[01:28:15.409 --> 01:28:20.431]  I know he doesn't know that much about what is at risk to shut it down.
[01:28:20.431 --> 01:28:26.293]  But I think that it would be... Let's not talk about what might happen.
[01:28:26.293 --> 01:28:28.114]  Let's not talk about what might happen.
[01:28:29.955 --> 01:28:30.515]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:30.515 --> 01:28:45.186]  Let's not look at how the Democrats and Republicans both signed up as lobbyists with foreign firms to pass the laws to then go join the firms to be paid millions of dollars a year, in many cases, to be traitors.
[01:28:45.186 --> 01:28:46.627]  That was it, period.
[01:28:46.627 --> 01:28:51.711]  They used our open society, the globalists did, to come in here and sell out everything.
[01:28:51.711 --> 01:28:54.373]  And half the public hates the president for trying to fix it.
[01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:01.652]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:29:01.652 --> 01:29:05.875]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:07.276]  The Bug Assault.
[01:29:07.276 --> 01:29:12.940]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:15.342]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.
[01:29:15.342 --> 01:29:18.684]  So much fun, you'll forget you have a wife and kids!
[01:29:18.684 --> 01:29:20.526]  Makes the perfect stocking stuffer.

[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:03.143]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[01:30:03.143 --> 01:30:07.706]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[01:30:07.706 --> 01:30:18.214]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:18.214 --> 01:30:22.056]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[01:30:22.056 --> 01:30:23.598]  All the sales the last 12 days
[01:30:24.378 --> 01:30:26.801]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off is back.
[01:30:26.801 --> 01:30:27.902]  Free shipping is still there.
[01:30:27.902 --> 01:30:29.284]  Double Patriot points.
[01:30:29.284 --> 01:30:32.528]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[01:30:32.528 --> 01:30:37.053]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[01:30:37.053 --> 01:30:38.534]  Just go check out the sales.
[01:30:38.534 --> 01:30:39.856]  There's too many to break them all down.
[01:30:39.856 --> 01:30:43.640]  Get your orders in by the 19th, so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[01:30:44.381 --> 01:30:46.402]  And thank you again all for your support.
[01:30:46.402 --> 01:30:50.843]  We're extending this sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:30:50.843 --> 01:30:55.524]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the globals together.
[01:30:55.524 --> 01:30:55.784]  Thank you.
[01:31:05.365 --> 01:31:06.866]  That wants to hurt children.
[01:31:06.866 --> 01:31:08.007]  They want to abort children.
[01:31:08.007 --> 01:31:09.748]  They want to disease children.
[01:31:09.748 --> 01:31:10.869]  They want to abuse children.
[01:31:10.869 --> 01:31:12.511]  They want to confuse children.
[01:31:12.511 --> 01:31:13.671]  They want their essence.
[01:31:13.671 --> 01:31:14.632]  They want their soul.
[01:31:14.632 --> 01:31:15.953]  They want their spirit.
[01:31:15.953 --> 01:31:17.715]  They want their power.
[01:31:17.715 --> 01:31:19.956]  Because they are our future.
[01:31:19.956 --> 01:31:23.479]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[01:31:23.479 --> 01:31:25.460]  It is about the West.
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:29.604]  And it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[01:31:29.604 --> 01:31:31.165]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[01:31:32.367 --> 01:31:42.875]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[01:31:42.875 --> 01:31:44.957]  You have the power to override the censors.
[01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:48.059]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[01:31:48.059 --> 01:31:57.106]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[01:31:58.124 --> 01:32:07.169]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[01:32:07.169 --> 01:32:08.509]  We've been proven dead on.
[01:32:08.509 --> 01:32:12.371]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[01:32:12.371 --> 01:32:16.753]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you.
[01:32:16.753 --> 01:32:18.054]  All words are not enough.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:25.066]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[01:32:25.066 --> 01:32:31.291]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[01:32:31.291 --> 01:32:35.275]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[01:32:35.275 --> 01:32:37.176]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[01:32:37.176 --> 01:32:41.200]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[01:32:41.764 --> 01:32:47.448]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[01:32:47.448 --> 01:33:01.116]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[01:33:01.116 --> 01:33:03.758]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.161 --> 01:33:29.213]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.213 --> 01:33:30.234]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:30.234 --> 01:33:32.876]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday Worldwide Edition.
[01:33:32.876 --> 01:33:34.937]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:34.937 --> 01:33:39.641]  The band websites are newswars.com, infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[01:33:39.641 --> 01:33:41.663]  I want to give the phone number out.
[01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:50.491]  And take your calls on a raft of issues, but I'd like specifically to be on these topics because I want to get your take on this.
[01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:56.493]  Are you upset with the private Federal Reserve openly raising interest rates when they didn't own Obama to kill the economy?
[01:33:56.493 --> 01:34:00.273]  And Democrats running around celebrating trying to drive it down, and that's not even an issue.
[01:34:00.273 --> 01:34:02.154]  We should make that a big political issue.
[01:34:02.154 --> 01:34:03.374]  The President was right.
[01:34:03.374 --> 01:34:04.854]  This is economic sabotage.
[01:34:04.854 --> 01:34:07.275]  At the very same multinational banks that own our Federal Reserve,
[01:34:08.835 --> 01:34:11.437]  Just like the EU controls England even though they never voted to enter it?
[01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:13.039]  This is just asinine.
[01:34:13.039 --> 01:34:24.468]  These very same people are threatening Spain and Italy and all these other nations that if you try to pull out of the Euro or you don't keep your borders open, we're going to implode your economy.
[01:34:24.468 --> 01:34:30.653]  Well, how about the militaries of those countries arrest the agents of those companies in their countries?
[01:34:30.653 --> 01:34:34.316]  How about we stop putting up with the white shoe boys pulling this crap?
[01:34:34.316 --> 01:34:35.698]  You know, that's what Russia did.
[01:34:37.284 --> 01:34:41.108]  Russia just arrested all the Rothschild Rockefeller agents.
[01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:48.336]  And then the Rothschilds sued, what was it, six, seven years ago, a bunch of newspapers saying, we're not really running the oligarchs.
[01:34:48.336 --> 01:34:54.803]  And the judge in some of the cases, the Rothschilds lost all the cases, said it's incredible.
[01:34:54.803 --> 01:34:58.648]  This defamation libel suit proves you were doing this to Russia.
[01:35:01.445 --> 01:35:03.926]  Why do we put up with this crap?
[01:35:03.926 --> 01:35:23.115]  Why do we put up with Macron saying we're gonna have 200 million more people brought in from overseas, and that France is no longer France, and the nation doesn't exist, and then our media says Trump's evil, he says America exists, and that he said the word nationalist.
[01:35:23.115 --> 01:35:27.877]  I mean, you talk about jumping the shark, ladies and gentlemen, it's really, really insane.
[01:35:29.929 --> 01:35:30.909]  So I want to talk about that.
[01:35:30.909 --> 01:35:38.571]  I want to talk about Pelosi saying, we'll just shut the government down forever to keep the border open.
[01:35:38.571 --> 01:35:40.992]  And Sarah Sanders made a great point.
[01:35:40.992 --> 01:35:44.993]  Democrats haven't decided they love our country more than they hate the president.
[01:35:44.993 --> 01:35:48.374]  Because that's what they're doing is trying to literally drive the country into the ground.
[01:35:48.374 --> 01:35:49.774]  Well, they've already decided, Sarah.
[01:35:52.227 --> 01:35:54.869]  The Democratic Party says America was never great.
[01:35:54.869 --> 01:35:55.890]  It'll never be great.
[01:35:55.890 --> 01:35:56.790]  They're globalist.
[01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:58.712]  They hate the country.
[01:35:58.712 --> 01:36:07.678]  They're a criminal cabal that loots from their dumbest constituent up to the top criminal kingpins that don't pay taxes.
[01:36:07.678 --> 01:36:10.020]  We all know it.
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:17.846]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are drooling over going after Trump on campaign finance when it's not a campaign.
[01:36:19.434 --> 01:36:28.279]  Contribution to a campaign when it's his private money to give money to an old fling?
[01:36:28.279 --> 01:36:34.703]  But they're saying, well, any money he spent during a campaign, you know, because it was during a campaign, that was to make him look good for the campaign.
[01:36:34.703 --> 01:36:37.665]  So that's a campaign contribution.
[01:36:37.665 --> 01:36:42.828]  You know, the last five years, they were down to one vote on the Federal Elections Commission.
[01:36:44.249 --> 01:36:53.292]  And the head Democrat on it wanted Infowars shut down, and she said, just type it in, a head Democrat on federal election submission says shut down Alex Jones Infowars.
[01:36:53.292 --> 01:36:56.592]  They had hearings three years ago, two years ago.
[01:36:56.592 --> 01:37:03.534]  She's off the committee now, but they had the majority of the Democrats voting, but the Republicans had one more vote.
[01:37:03.534 --> 01:37:12.997]  And they were saying, we're going to shut down Alex Jones, we're going to shut down Matt Drudge, because everything they do is Republican, and so it's an in-kind donation.
[01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:16.375]  Total bull!
[01:37:16.375 --> 01:37:19.537]  But that's how they're extending all this crap out.
[01:37:19.537 --> 01:37:25.640]  And then they've got Cohen up there saying, the president told me to cover this up.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.881]  Cohen, you tried to record him.
[01:37:26.881 --> 01:37:29.382]  You were probably already busted for this stuff years ago.
[01:37:29.382 --> 01:37:31.624]  That's pretty clear.
[01:37:31.624 --> 01:37:34.025]  And he said, yeah, we're gonna make the payment.
[01:37:34.025 --> 01:37:35.906]  And Trump's like, no, you're not.
[01:37:35.906 --> 01:37:36.086]  What?
[01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:40.031]  These people are rats.
[01:37:40.031 --> 01:37:46.193]  Imagine being a rat like Cohen, and he's just always trying to set Trump up for years, so he could get some leverage over him.
[01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:47.013]  But he could never do it.
[01:37:47.013 --> 01:37:51.694]  Because Cohen knew he was committing a whole bunch of crimes.
[01:37:51.694 --> 01:37:59.976]  And now this admitted, convicted criminal, who pled guilty to all these crimes, he's now telling us the President's a bad guy.
[01:37:59.976 --> 01:38:01.697]  But just, you know, don't forget, where's the Russia?
[01:38:01.697 --> 01:38:02.277]  Where's the Russia?
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.300]  Where's the Russia?
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.921]  It doesn't exist.
[01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:11.443]  And right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down over 400 points.
[01:38:11.443 --> 01:38:14.105]  And that makes the Democrats happy, because they want you poor.
[01:38:14.105 --> 01:38:15.645]  They want you on welfare.
[01:38:15.645 --> 01:38:17.006]  They want you not working.
[01:38:17.006 --> 01:38:22.228]  They want you destitute, because they want to break you and control every facet of your life.
[01:38:22.228 --> 01:38:24.629]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.689]  877-789-2539.
[01:38:24.689 --> 01:38:24.889]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:38:35.731 --> 01:38:41.496]  And that's the number for you to be able to join us, and I'd love to hear from you on air.
[01:38:41.496 --> 01:38:42.577]  877-789-2539.
[01:38:42.577 --> 01:38:48.301]  Now remember, I'm not up here covering all this really negative, bad stuff, because I want to demoralize you.
[01:38:48.301 --> 01:38:55.988]  They want us off the air because they know it's exposing what they're doing, and that they won't be able to get away with it.
[01:38:55.988 --> 01:38:57.089]  It's that simple.
[01:38:57.089 --> 01:38:58.790]  And, you know, I'm not a litigious person.
[01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:59.551]  I don't like lawsuits.
[01:39:01.224 --> 01:39:13.052]  I've learned that when we point out how business scams work that nobody else is doing, when we point out how global scams work, we point out how they're taking your blood at birth and giving it to big tech labs who then patent your own proteins.
[01:39:13.052 --> 01:39:17.736]  So when you need gene therapy later, they tell you they own it.
[01:39:17.736 --> 01:39:22.619]  Our research helped lead to lawsuits that are stopping that, just talking about it.
[01:39:22.619 --> 01:39:24.801]  And people go research and go, wow, that's really true.
[01:39:24.801 --> 01:39:26.442]  No one ever had that angle on it.
[01:39:26.442 --> 01:39:27.663]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:39:29.155 --> 01:39:33.616]  With how the Democrats make the money off of being immigration lawyers.
[01:39:33.616 --> 01:39:37.017]  And how they then have mafias and skim money off these people.
[01:39:37.017 --> 01:39:43.038]  But particularly Hispanics won't go to the police because they're more corrupt in the third world than anything else the police are.
[01:39:43.038 --> 01:39:45.739]  And so they're the perfect group to be preyed on.
[01:39:45.739 --> 01:39:48.719]  And then meanwhile the Democrats act like they're their advocates.
[01:39:48.719 --> 01:39:50.320]  Very, very sick.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:50.920]  Very, very evil.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.260]  So that's what we're doing.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:55.621]  We're covering all these things because so much of what we do then
[01:39:57.952 --> 01:40:02.393]  Begins the debate, begins the discussion about things that no one else is talking about.
[01:40:02.393 --> 01:40:05.054]  That's what InfoWars is important.
[01:40:05.054 --> 01:40:06.034]  That's why you're important.
[01:40:06.034 --> 01:40:16.456]  That's why your support of us isn't just critical, it's absolutely imperative.
[01:40:16.456 --> 01:40:27.319]  Right now, George Soros, Hillary, the Democrats are harassing and seeking out any type of merchant account we have so that you can't even go to InfoWarsTore.com
[01:40:28.843 --> 01:40:31.845]  And use a credit card, a debit card, a digital check, any of that.
[01:40:31.845 --> 01:40:37.689]  They want to block you from your right to commerce.
[01:40:37.689 --> 01:40:40.931]  But they can't do it right now because we have merchant accounts.
[01:40:40.931 --> 01:40:45.274]  But I'm selling everything out so we don't have to pay inventory tax.
[01:40:45.274 --> 01:40:48.116]  And so that we're funded a few months into the next year regardless.
[01:40:49.696 --> 01:40:53.942]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com is where you go.
[01:40:53.942 --> 01:40:56.025]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.
[01:40:56.025 --> 01:41:00.212]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the sub-URL of the great supplements that are so popular.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.161]  We're bringing back all of the unprecedented 12 Days of Christmas specials.
[01:41:06.161 --> 01:41:08.402]  The 12 Days of Christmas was going to end tomorrow.
[01:41:08.402 --> 01:41:10.922]  That's when we started it, 12 days ago, or 11 days ago.
[01:41:10.922 --> 01:41:15.703]  But I decided, now some things are about to sell out, but we're going to bring all the specials back.
[01:41:15.703 --> 01:41:22.785]  We always have 50 to 75% off storewide, but particularly we have a best-selling item at 60% off.
[01:41:22.785 --> 01:41:31.107]  All of those specials have been brought back, on top of all the other specials, and the free t-shirt with every order, and the free shipping, and the double Patriot points on your next order.
[01:41:33.055 --> 01:41:36.777]  10% on each dollar to the 5%, you can't beat it.
[01:41:36.777 --> 01:41:39.898]  We're bringing back all of the unprecedented Christmas specials for a limited time.
[01:41:39.898 --> 01:41:47.522]  Over the past 12 days at InfoWarsTore.com, we've launched some of the biggest specials ever to help you stock up on Christmas and support the InfoWar.
[01:41:47.522 --> 01:41:53.404]  These specials were such massive loss leaders that we could only promote them for 24 hours.
[01:41:53.404 --> 01:41:59.187]  But now we're bringing all of our Christmas mega specials back at InfoWarsTore.com for a limited time only.
[01:42:00.205 --> 01:42:02.666]  And many are already completely selling out.
[01:42:02.666 --> 01:42:07.568]  I have made the decision to completely sell all of our 2018 inventory at some of the lowest prices ever.
[01:42:07.568 --> 01:42:12.950]  These are the lowest we've ever done, by leaps and bounds, to avoid paying ridiculous amounts of government inventory tax.
[01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:23.113]  This is your last chance to take advantage of these Christmas super specials, including Rainforce Plus, 55% off, free shipping and a free t-shirt and double Patriot points.
[01:42:23.113 --> 01:42:27.735]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% of Humidoids, Unbelievable for Inflammation, you name it.
[01:42:29.404 --> 01:42:30.925]  50, 60% off.
[01:42:30.925 --> 01:42:34.187]  Last run of Super Mel Vitality and Super Female Vitality, 55% off.
[01:42:34.187 --> 01:42:37.689]  Ultimate Bone Broth, 55% off, despite the fact it's a bestseller.

[01:42:48.615 --> 01:42:50.676]  All of it, store-bought free shipping.
[01:42:50.676 --> 01:42:52.377]  All of it, double Patriot points.
[01:42:52.377 --> 01:42:54.058]  All of it, free t-shirt.
[01:42:54.058 --> 01:42:55.319]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:55.319 --> 01:42:55.599]  Thank you.

[01:43:56.843 --> 01:44:06.150]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:44:06.150 --> 01:44:09.013]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:44:09.013 --> 01:44:15.058]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:44:15.718 --> 01:44:21.984]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:21.984 --> 01:44:28.290]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:44:28.290 --> 01:44:35.317]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:44:35.317 --> 01:44:35.517]  But!
[01:44:36.338 --> 01:44:49.362]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.362 --> 01:44:53.623]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:53.623 --> 01:44:56.324]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:44:57.850 --> 01:44:57.890]  No.
[01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:16.891]  Also add a free gift with every order.
[01:45:16.891 --> 01:45:25.754]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:45:25.754 --> 01:45:29.415]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[01:45:29.415 --> 01:45:34.776]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[01:45:34.776 --> 01:45:37.157]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:45:37.717 --> 01:45:42.581]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:45:42.581 --> 01:45:44.122]  So this is a loss leader.
[01:45:44.122 --> 01:45:45.703]  We are losing money on this.
[01:45:45.703 --> 01:45:47.125]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:45:47.125 --> 01:45:49.126]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:45:49.126 --> 01:45:50.467]  And don't fight the crowds.
[01:45:50.467 --> 01:45:51.888]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:51.888 --> 01:45:53.390]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[01:45:57.933 --> 01:46:00.615]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:46:00.615 --> 01:46:06.960]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.741]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[01:46:08.741 --> 01:46:15.306]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[01:46:15.586 --> 01:46:21.748]  Made with ancient ingredients used for thousands of years, Happies can help you take back the day.

[01:46:27.850 --> 01:46:35.693]  With poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life, it's more important than ever to support your body in the fight against stress.
[01:46:36.153 --> 01:46:38.413]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:22.026 --> 01:47:33.896]  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
[01:47:33.896 --> 01:47:40.022]  Without saying a word, you can light up the dark.
[01:47:40.022 --> 01:47:43.605]  Try as I may, I could never
[01:47:51.846 --> 01:48:00.553]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:00.553 --> 01:48:06.378]  We're going to be going to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:48:06.378 --> 01:48:11.082]  But I thought I would just point out that Congressman Ted Lieu
[01:48:20.515 --> 01:48:27.801]  Went on national television a few days ago, we played it yesterday, and said he would love nothing more than to silence people's speech.
[01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:32.024]  But that it's up to private companies to do it.
[01:48:32.024 --> 01:48:36.428]  And in all of this is the crux to everything.
[01:48:36.428 --> 01:48:45.455]  Because under Section 230, the big tech giants have no right to censor anybody.
[01:48:45.455 --> 01:48:47.877]  Because they're given liability protection.
[01:48:52.301 --> 01:48:59.403]  Next hour, I'm going to play Tucker Carlson's report on that for a segment, and I'm going to play Mark Dice's report on that for the segment.
[01:48:59.403 --> 01:49:07.245]  But first, we're going to take calls until the bottom of the next hour, and then Matt Bracken's going to be hosting on national security issues in the fourth hour.
[01:49:07.245 --> 01:49:08.165]  And I'll be back this Sunday.
[01:49:08.165 --> 01:49:09.626]  I'll be live 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:49:09.626 --> 01:49:15.287]  I'm also going to come up here tomorrow and do a live special broadcast.
[01:49:15.287 --> 01:49:19.068]  And I'm almost tempted that I may be the person that hosts a weeknight show.
[01:49:19.068 --> 01:49:20.809]  I think I may have to double down here.
[01:49:21.670 --> 01:49:27.515]  Because there's the discipline of life that makes it get done.
[01:49:27.515 --> 01:49:30.738]  And in that is really what it all comes down to.
[01:49:30.738 --> 01:49:40.646]  We have to fight hard in this historical moment we've entered.
[01:49:40.646 --> 01:49:45.871]  Because you hear him say, I'd love to censor, but we're the government.
[01:49:46.704 --> 01:49:49.185]  We can't do it, but companies can.
[01:49:49.185 --> 01:49:53.848]  These companies operate as utilities, under law.
[01:49:53.848 --> 01:50:01.653]  And I have all these Democrats come to me, and all these reporters, and they go, Alex, what should be changed?
[01:50:01.653 --> 01:50:02.773]  What should be done?
[01:50:02.773 --> 01:50:04.254]  When they're ignorant.
[01:50:04.254 --> 01:50:06.475]  And they go, you know, what should the law be?
[01:50:06.475 --> 01:50:09.457]  And it's like, we already have a law.
[01:50:09.457 --> 01:50:15.561]  If I have a message board on InfoWars.com, or NewsWars.com, or a comment section, which we have,
[01:50:17.341 --> 01:50:21.783]  I'm not liable when a third party comes on there and says they're going to kill somebody.
[01:50:21.783 --> 01:50:27.265]  I just got to respond to the subpoena if I get one.
[01:50:27.265 --> 01:50:30.806]  And we have moderators that would generally take that down because that's illegal.
[01:50:30.806 --> 01:50:36.048]  But I'm still not liable because they could post it and then I'd be that second guilty.
[01:50:39.295 --> 01:50:40.955]  So that's how they play these games.
[01:50:40.955 --> 01:50:42.436]  It's been set up in law.
[01:50:42.436 --> 01:50:44.476]  Section 230 has been adopted all over the world.
[01:50:44.476 --> 01:50:45.256]  The U.S.
[01:50:45.256 --> 01:50:46.496]  invented the Internet.
[01:50:46.496 --> 01:50:49.877]  We came up with a system to regulate it.
[01:50:49.877 --> 01:50:50.617]  It's worked.
[01:50:50.617 --> 01:50:51.678]  It made sense.
[01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:57.679]  And now by fiat, these companies are simply getting rid of it.
[01:50:57.679 --> 01:51:00.899]  They're acting as publishers and they're deciding what to keep up.
[01:51:00.899 --> 01:51:08.261]  But when Sundar Pichai of Google gets up in front of Congress and he says, we do not
[01:51:10.074 --> 01:51:14.676]  Censor or block Republicans or Conservatives.
[01:51:14.676 --> 01:51:16.576]  We only do it to hate.
[01:51:16.576 --> 01:51:19.377]  Well, that's playing a game.
[01:51:19.377 --> 01:51:26.520]  Oh, we don't rape children, and they put a sticker on a child, but we do rape bobble bops.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:29.460]  It's really a children, but they just stuck a sticker on it calling it a bobble bop.
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:31.101]  You can use any stupid word you wanted.
[01:51:31.101 --> 01:51:33.642]  But the Southern Poverty Law Center, this trusted flagger,
[01:51:35.031 --> 01:51:43.499]  The ADL, the Trusted Flagger, the Media Matters, Soros' arm, I mean, he funds them all.
[01:51:43.499 --> 01:51:45.561]  Trusted Flagger.
[01:51:45.561 --> 01:51:48.243]  Those are groups funded by the Democratic Party, by U.S.
[01:51:48.243 --> 01:51:51.867]  taxpayers, by the State Department, USAID.
[01:51:51.867 --> 01:51:54.169]  Your tax money goes to George Soros.
[01:51:54.169 --> 01:51:55.931]  He keeps a heapin' helpin' of it for himself.
[01:51:57.076 --> 01:52:01.017]  You don't think that criminal that pays no taxes is actually giving his money to you?
[01:52:01.017 --> 01:52:14.683]  He swindles it all in, hands it all out to the different groups, and they fund the migrant caravans and the open borders and the groups teaching your five-year-old how to give a good you-know-what, how to wear a dress, your five-year-old son.
[01:52:14.683 --> 01:52:16.923]  They fund it all because he's an agent.
[01:52:16.923 --> 01:52:17.784]  It's his job.
[01:52:17.784 --> 01:52:19.864]  He helped fund the overthrow of the Soviet Union.
[01:52:19.864 --> 01:52:20.745]  But not to fix it!
[01:52:21.565 --> 01:52:24.846]  He helped set up the oligarchs to gang-rape the Russians!
[01:52:24.846 --> 01:52:25.907]  He's a gang-raper!
[01:52:25.907 --> 01:52:27.247]  It's what he does!
[01:52:27.247 --> 01:52:31.548]  He wants to rape your family financially, too!
[01:52:31.548 --> 01:52:40.612]  And have big, fat, ugly-looking pedophiles come in there and tell your five-year-old about sex and stuff daddy and mommy wouldn't even talk to him about, but don't worry, you got a new uncle!
[01:52:40.612 --> 01:52:42.792]  He's wearing a big purple wig!
[01:52:42.792 --> 01:52:47.294]  He's gonna tell ya... about your ding-a-ling.
[01:52:47.294 --> 01:52:49.935]  And people say, oh, that's really gross to say that on air, hey...
[01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:54.259]  This is what they're teaching everybody's kids, man!
[01:52:54.259 --> 01:53:04.001]  And we just put up with it, so there's a big, fat, green light, because men act passive to this type of crap.
[01:53:04.001 --> 01:53:06.522]  Well, I'm not acting passive to it anymore.
[01:53:06.522 --> 01:53:09.403]  It fundamentally makes me angry.
[01:53:09.403 --> 01:53:14.204]  But I'm putting that anger into action, and I'm asking you to do the same thing.
[01:53:14.204 --> 01:53:17.345]  So when you see Congressman Lew, who we're about to play a clip of,
[01:53:19.864 --> 01:53:24.187]  I sat there in that committee hearing, 30 feet from him, watching him for hours.
[01:53:24.187 --> 01:53:25.108]  I couldn't keep my eyes.
[01:53:25.108 --> 01:53:32.694]  You know, Hank Johnson was there and Congressman Deutch and all these other weirdos.
[01:53:32.694 --> 01:53:33.875]  And Sheila Jackson Lee.
[01:53:33.875 --> 01:53:38.919]  I mean, it was like a gallery of weirdos.
[01:53:38.919 --> 01:53:42.201]  He kept talking under his breath, repeating what he was going to say when his statement came up.
[01:53:42.201 --> 01:53:44.123]  And I watched him do the statement.
[01:53:44.123 --> 01:53:46.345]  And you just talk about a robot.
[01:53:46.345 --> 01:53:47.726]  So when you hear what he says, he's been
[01:53:50.535 --> 01:54:00.597]  Google executives on record donate money to him and Nadler and others and they give them the press release, the talking points that they read back in the question so Sundar can look so smart.
[01:54:00.597 --> 01:54:02.378]  They're all engaged in the perjury together.
[01:54:02.378 --> 01:54:08.379]  And he gets up there and talks about hate speech and Alex Jones and I've got to be banned and another congresswoman got up and said that.
[01:54:08.379 --> 01:54:13.400]  Oh, we've seen Alex Jones here today spreading his conspiracy theories.
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:13.540]  Yeah.
[01:54:18.103 --> 01:54:29.779]  And then he goes on national television and he says, I'd love to shut these right-wingers up to something called the First Amendment, but it's the job of the companies.
[01:54:29.779 --> 01:54:34.345]  So he says, it's the job of the companies to shut us up.
[01:54:34.345 --> 01:54:35.787]  Well, I mean, digitally now.
[01:54:37.622 --> 01:54:41.323]  You try to type in a cuss word in your iPhone or Droid, it won't let you send it.
[01:54:41.323 --> 01:54:42.344]  Well, they're already saying that.
[01:54:42.344 --> 01:54:56.009]  Well, now words like mother and father and she or he, those in certain sentences on iPhones and on Google searches, you're not going to be able to type them in.
[01:54:56.009 --> 01:54:57.109]  Wow!
[01:54:57.109 --> 01:55:00.330]  That was announced last week.
[01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:01.731]  Now you're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:55:02.807 --> 01:55:13.433]  What did I say a few months ago when people all over the world couldn't send emojis of the Taiwanese flag, period, because China told Apple, we don't say that flag exists.
[01:55:13.433 --> 01:55:16.655]  And they said, yes, sir, boss.
[01:55:16.655 --> 01:55:18.756]  And for a month, you couldn't send that emoji.
[01:55:18.756 --> 01:55:21.077]  There was a backlash to it.
[01:55:21.077 --> 01:55:21.978]  But they keep doing it.
[01:55:21.978 --> 01:55:24.079]  They think someday you'll just give up, which people are doing.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:26.461]  And that's this game of attrition.
[01:55:26.461 --> 01:55:27.021]  Push it.
[01:55:27.021 --> 01:55:27.581]  Push it.
[01:55:27.581 --> 01:55:28.101]  Push it.
[01:55:28.101 --> 01:55:28.661]  Push it.
[01:55:28.661 --> 01:55:29.202]  Do it.
[01:55:29.202 --> 01:55:29.722]  Do it.
[01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:30.202]  Do it.
[01:55:30.202 --> 01:55:30.482]  Do it.
[01:55:30.482 --> 01:55:36.965]  Until people are so sick of being censored, they just finally just give up on the platforms altogether.
[01:55:36.965 --> 01:55:38.885]  So it's about who wants it most.
[01:55:38.885 --> 01:55:39.365]  You know what?
[01:55:39.365 --> 01:55:40.546]  You try to wear me out?
[01:55:40.546 --> 01:55:41.766]  That just makes me stronger.
[01:55:41.766 --> 01:55:43.987]  That's like what weightlifting is.
[01:55:43.987 --> 01:55:53.611]  But see, there's this passive spirit of malaise that comes over people, and they don't have that animating spirit of liberty, and it's like they're dead inside.
[01:55:54.206 --> 01:55:55.127]  And that's okay.
[01:55:55.127 --> 01:56:00.331]  Let the dead bury the dead, as Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, said.
[01:56:00.331 --> 01:56:01.752]  But you're not dead.
[01:56:01.752 --> 01:56:03.033]  And that's why they hate you.
[01:56:03.033 --> 01:56:06.736]  Because I'm not that powerful.
[01:56:06.736 --> 01:56:15.844]  But this broadcast and this platform, like a photon tube, that focuses a bunch of light into it, all of us together,
[01:56:17.298 --> 01:56:22.641]  This isn't some thousand points of light, that's an Illuminati term, but they take everything that's real and they create a counterfeit.
[01:56:22.641 --> 01:56:38.731]  But the billions of points of light, God's spirit shining through us together, coming together with a broadcast like this, that's what they fear because that's like a particle beam of truth that can fire out!
[01:56:38.731 --> 01:56:39.651]  And that's what they're scared of.
[01:56:39.651 --> 01:56:41.152]  So we're gonna go to break.
[01:56:41.152 --> 01:56:44.254]  Come back to your calls.
[01:56:44.254 --> 01:56:46.576]  But since I mentioned it, let's go out to break with Mr. Liu.
[01:56:46.576 --> 01:56:46.856]  Here it is.
[01:56:47.978 --> 01:56:52.300]  I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech.
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:55.221]  The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.
[01:56:55.221 --> 01:56:57.622]  And that's simply a function of the First Amendment.
[01:56:57.622 --> 01:57:03.324]  But I think over the long run, it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech.
[01:57:03.324 --> 01:57:08.467]  I would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves.
[01:57:08.467 --> 01:57:11.908]  But it's really nothing that I believe government can do.
[01:57:11.908 --> 01:57:13.609]  And so that's been my position all along.
[01:57:14.397 --> 01:57:17.318]  So they've sold this idea, and the Heritage Foundation has done it too.
[01:57:17.318 --> 01:57:23.721]  Well, if it's Google, bigger than most governments, and it's got more data than the NSA, then it's okay.
[01:57:23.721 --> 01:57:32.765]  But it's a political group, the Democrats, the globalists, Soros, who are actually running Google and deciding what can go up and what can't go up and what comes down.
[01:57:32.765 --> 01:57:34.066]  So incredible.
[01:57:34.066 --> 01:57:37.347]  And the Republicans are just now figuring out what's happened.
[01:57:37.347 --> 01:57:41.909]  They better figure it out real quick or it's game over.
[01:57:41.909 --> 01:57:42.890]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:43.310]  Stay with me.
[01:57:47.284 --> 01:57:57.893]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.893 --> 01:57:59.955]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.955 --> 01:58:02.817]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.817 --> 01:58:04.018]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.639 --> 01:58:05.300]  We're good to go.
[01:58:27.998 --> 01:58:39.722]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.722 --> 01:58:43.024]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:43.024 --> 01:58:46.365]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:48.908 --> 01:58:53.371]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[01:58:53.371 --> 01:58:57.914]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[01:58:57.914 --> 01:59:08.421]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:08.421 --> 01:59:12.264]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[01:59:12.264 --> 01:59:13.805]  All the sales the last 12 days
[01:59:14.885 --> 01:59:17.007]  50 to 75% off is back.
[01:59:17.007 --> 01:59:18.088]  Free shipping is still there.
[01:59:18.088 --> 01:59:19.489]  Double Patriot points.
[01:59:19.489 --> 01:59:22.732]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[01:59:22.732 --> 01:59:27.256]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[01:59:27.256 --> 01:59:28.717]  Just go check out the sales.
[01:59:28.717 --> 01:59:30.018]  There's too many to break them all down.
[01:59:30.018 --> 01:59:31.780]  Get your orders in by the 19th.
[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:33.841]  You're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[01:59:34.582 --> 01:59:36.604]  And thank you again all for your support.
[01:59:36.604 --> 01:59:41.068]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:59:41.068 --> 01:59:45.732]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the Globals together.
[01:59:45.732 --> 01:59:50.936]  Thank you.
[01:59:50.936 --> 01:59:53.579]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:05.408]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:05.408 --> 02:00:13.282]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:36.011]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:36.011 --> 02:00:37.152]  About to go to your phone calls.
[02:00:37.152 --> 02:00:41.675]  Appreciate you all holding here.
[02:00:41.675 --> 02:00:43.235]  Who should we start with first here?
[02:00:43.235 --> 02:00:48.358]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:00:48.358 --> 02:00:50.039]  Let's go to Walt in New York.
[02:00:50.039 --> 02:00:51.440]  Walt, thanks for holding here on the air.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:52.721]  Go ahead.
[02:00:52.721 --> 02:00:53.241]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:53.241 --> 02:00:54.042]  How are you doing?
[02:00:54.042 --> 02:00:54.942]  I'm doing pretty good.
[02:00:54.942 --> 02:00:59.605]  I mean, you know, you got the French military, top generals saying Macron should be arrested for treason.
[02:01:00.544 --> 02:01:01.425]  Which is what's happening.
[02:01:01.425 --> 02:01:03.025]  So, I mean, people are starting to wake up.
[02:01:03.025 --> 02:01:04.506]  It's just people always wake up so late.
[02:01:04.506 --> 02:01:07.828]  How bad is this going to get before we turn it around?
[02:01:07.828 --> 02:01:10.690]  Well, we've got electronics going for us today, Alex.
[02:01:10.690 --> 02:01:12.510]  We're talking maybe to a million people, right?
[02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:15.272]  I would say probably more than that, yeah.
[02:01:15.272 --> 02:01:22.776]  You know, way back in 1913, when the Federal Reserve came in, very few voices really understood what it was.
[02:01:22.776 --> 02:01:28.099]  But the people who were behind it knew it held the ultimate political power to be able to
[02:01:29.156 --> 02:01:36.964]  Uh, create the currency which was a power under the Constitution, but Congress gave it up to this private group of bankers.
[02:01:37.938 --> 02:01:41.721]  And Charles Lindbergh Jr., who we know in the spirit of St.
[02:01:41.721 --> 02:01:48.366]  Louis flew across the Atlantic, his father was a congressman at the time who fought valiantly against it.
[02:01:48.366 --> 02:01:49.006]  This is a quote.
[02:01:49.006 --> 02:01:49.286]  He said,
[02:02:07.699 --> 02:02:08.561]  So we got two things.
[02:02:08.561 --> 02:02:14.556]  We got this electronic power, which the founders didn't understand, but is vast.
[02:02:14.556 --> 02:02:15.538]  And if we lose this...
[02:02:16.283 --> 02:02:17.724]  We will lose the battle.
[02:02:17.724 --> 02:02:28.412]  We have to keep the First Amendment as it applies to electronics alive and well and apply antitrust to these big tech corporations.
[02:02:28.412 --> 02:02:29.713]  They have to be put in their place.
[02:02:29.713 --> 02:02:35.958]  We the people have to preserve that First Amendment because if we lose the power to speak, then we'll lose it all.
[02:02:35.958 --> 02:02:37.900]  But we also have to get a handle on this
[02:02:39.179 --> 02:02:42.040]  Let's be clear, because you're an awesome call, Walt.
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:43.801]  You're making great points.
[02:02:43.801 --> 02:02:45.441]  Your phone's crystal clear.
[02:02:45.441 --> 02:02:45.861]  I love you.
[02:03:05.993 --> 02:03:08.535]  China's had 10% growth rates for 20, 30 years.
[02:03:08.535 --> 02:03:09.295]  Oh, that's all fine.
[02:03:09.295 --> 02:03:10.836]  We start getting a 4.5.
[02:03:10.836 --> 02:03:12.757]  Oh my gosh, it's overheating.
[02:03:12.757 --> 02:03:16.820]  Because again, exactly, they want to kill the American dream.
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:18.041]  That's their plan.
[02:03:18.041 --> 02:03:19.162]  That's their program.
[02:03:19.162 --> 02:03:26.606]  And expanding on the Federal Reserve and what it's done, and then now how they spin this whole thing that, oh, it's above the law.
[02:03:26.606 --> 02:03:27.527]  We can't do anything about it.
[02:03:27.527 --> 02:03:29.788]  And, oh, big tech, it's private companies.
[02:03:29.788 --> 02:03:35.132]  It'd be the same thing if they broke in on your phone call, if you were saying something that the company didn't like.
[02:03:35.632 --> 02:03:46.176]  And they said, let's say, Ma Bell, 30 years ago, before it got broken up, or when it got broken up, imagine if Ma Bell said, well, we're a private company, so we can control what you say in private conversations.
[02:03:46.176 --> 02:03:47.696]  No, that's prior restraint.
[02:03:47.696 --> 02:03:51.958]  And we have the law, Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act.
[02:03:51.958 --> 02:03:59.440]  So, they're violating the damn law, playing dumb like the public doesn't know, so it's up to us to inform Congress that we do know.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.840]  Because that's what's really scary.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:02.161]  The Republicans know what's going on here.
[02:04:03.615 --> 02:04:15.442]  Well, maybe the people of Congress could, you know, dig down deep inside their soul and discover a little patriotism and try to do something for the country and something for the future of humanity.
[02:04:15.442 --> 02:04:20.465]  Maybe they could try to enact legislation, beginning in the House, that would
[02:04:21.365 --> 02:04:25.569]  Uh, break up these big companies or limit their ability to control content.
[02:04:25.569 --> 02:04:31.995]  And maybe we could do something about the currency too and give that power back to the people under their representatives.
[02:04:31.995 --> 02:04:33.796]  How can they have all this power?
[02:04:33.796 --> 02:04:35.838]  Why have we surrendered these powers?
[02:04:35.838 --> 02:04:39.301]  The people need to wake up and assert themselves.
[02:04:39.301 --> 02:04:41.043]  What can we do to wake the people up, Alex?
[02:04:41.343 --> 02:04:46.091]  What you're doing right now, brother, and what you just said is absolutely 100% over the target.
[02:04:46.091 --> 02:04:54.323]  And it's just horrifying how they got control of our banking and our currency in 1913, and now with big tech, it's our communications, and they go, oh, it's okay, it's private!
[02:04:56.707 --> 02:05:00.649]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:03.950]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:10.213]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:05:10.213 --> 02:05:12.975]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:05:13.715 --> 02:05:17.537]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:05:17.537 --> 02:05:24.002]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:05:24.002 --> 02:05:28.965]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:33.652]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:05:33.652 --> 02:05:40.855]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.855 --> 02:05:45.557]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:05:45.557 --> 02:05:51.759]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:51.759 --> 02:05:55.741]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:05:57.418 --> 02:05:58.039]  You've got it.
[02:05:58.039 --> 02:06:04.544]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:04.544 --> 02:06:08.467]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:08.467 --> 02:06:14.992]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:14.992 --> 02:06:16.633]  Again!
[02:06:23.723 --> 02:06:27.345]  To the audience and to the crew, I'm a little bit of a jerk or bummed out sometimes.
[02:06:27.345 --> 02:06:28.346]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:06:28.346 --> 02:06:29.126]  I'm not whining.
[02:06:29.126 --> 02:06:30.968]  I just want you to know the byproduct.
[02:06:30.968 --> 02:06:34.870]  I get really pissed being informed and knowing what's going on.
[02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:48.659]  Like, do you think I get gleefully happy every day when I come in here and some prominent person dies or almost dies from taking a vaccine and it's even admitted that the vaccine did it and then they just try to push more vaccines?
[02:06:52.426 --> 02:06:53.366]  No, I get upset.
[02:06:53.366 --> 02:07:00.589]  I'm like, how much of this do we have to take?
[02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:10.273]  I don't get excited when mainstream news comes out, Politico, and goes, okay, there are giant no-go zones all over Europe, and none of the Muslims have jobs, and everything's collapsing.
[02:07:10.273 --> 02:07:13.715]  I just say, God Almighty, why couldn't we have stopped this earlier?
[02:07:13.715 --> 02:07:19.277]  The Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, hospitalized after pneumonia, vaccine goes wrong, almost died.
[02:07:30.985 --> 02:07:33.106]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:07:33.106 --> 02:07:35.427]  It just never ends.
[02:07:35.427 --> 02:07:38.348]  Meanwhile, there's some good news, though.
[02:07:38.348 --> 02:07:57.496]  Republicans announced last week, but it's finally hit the news today, that they're going to go ahead with hearings in this lame duck session of Congress, better late than never, with whistleblowers testifying live on television about the paper play and the criminal activities in the billions by the Clintons.
[02:07:59.909 --> 02:08:05.754]  Fox News, Republicans examine accusations of pay-to-play at Clinton Foundation amid plunge in donations.
[02:08:05.754 --> 02:08:10.819]  It's plunged over 90% since they're out of office.
[02:08:10.819 --> 02:08:15.483]  Meanwhile, Yellow Vest bringing Central London to a standstill.
[02:08:15.483 --> 02:08:26.313]  Unity News Network reports big demonstrations with the Yellow Vest blocking roads to protest the fake Brexit deal that would hand over total sovereignty of England to the
[02:08:28.223 --> 02:08:28.663]  He's got it.
[02:08:43.786 --> 02:08:48.008]  Senator Theresa May, but they're saying both those guys are very close to being removed from office.
[02:08:48.008 --> 02:08:51.429]  So, we're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:08:51.429 --> 02:08:57.152]  Globalism, as soon as we defined it, unelected corporations running our countries?
[02:08:57.152 --> 02:09:00.273]  Who say they want us poor to control us?
[02:09:00.273 --> 02:09:04.555]  Man, that's like selling people gasoline in the middle of a fire.
[02:09:04.555 --> 02:09:06.056]  Dump gasoline on your head.
[02:09:06.056 --> 02:09:07.597]  I'd rather sell snow cones to
[02:09:09.104 --> 02:09:13.026]  You know, folks in the Sahara, that's what freedom is versus socialism.
[02:09:13.026 --> 02:09:15.107]  So, we're in a really crazy place right now.
[02:09:15.107 --> 02:09:17.008]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:09:17.008 --> 02:09:18.549]  Wildman!
[02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:20.329]  Wildman!
[02:09:20.329 --> 02:09:21.650]  In the state of Texas.
[02:09:21.650 --> 02:09:22.210]  You're on the air.
[02:09:22.210 --> 02:09:23.471]  Thanks for holding.
[02:09:23.471 --> 02:09:24.772]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:09:24.772 --> 02:09:26.953]  Glad to take... Thank you for taking my call.
[02:09:26.953 --> 02:09:27.593]  Thanks for calling.
[02:09:27.593 --> 02:09:29.694]  Haven't talked to you in a while.
[02:09:29.694 --> 02:09:31.555]  Last time I called in, it's been a couple years.
[02:09:34.392 --> 02:09:37.614]  The crap across the border training ISIS over there and all that.
[02:09:37.614 --> 02:09:39.114]  But I called you.
[02:09:39.114 --> 02:09:45.857]  I found you due to research of my late wife's illness.
[02:09:45.857 --> 02:09:49.979]  And finding out about vaccines and and all the stuff.
[02:09:49.979 --> 02:09:51.580]  This is back in 2013.
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:55.562]  She passed away from ALS is what they named it.
[02:09:55.562 --> 02:10:00.824]  And in my research, I found out, you know, she her dad had.
[02:10:00.824 --> 02:10:02.545]  He was in Vietnam and
[02:10:03.021 --> 02:10:08.966]  And he ended up passing away from, like, nine strokes that he had.
[02:10:08.966 --> 02:10:19.636]  And she had four sisters, and she was the only one that went over there to Vietnam with him, and she had to take the same vaccines that the soldiers had to when she went over to South Korea.
[02:10:19.636 --> 02:10:21.537]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:21.537 --> 02:10:26.502]  And when she got that, that was a soft kill program, is what I found out in research.
[02:10:26.502 --> 02:10:30.085]  And she ended up getting this ALS at 53, and she passed away from it.
[02:10:30.509 --> 02:10:31.269]  Well, let's explain.
[02:10:31.269 --> 02:10:36.232]  They don't want a bunch of battle-hardened soldiers back in the country who are patriots.
[02:10:36.232 --> 02:10:39.974]  So you use them in a war, but after a war, what do you do?
[02:10:39.974 --> 02:10:41.095]  You spike a cannon.
[02:10:41.095 --> 02:10:44.837]  You pull the engine out of the helicopter when you put it at the park.
[02:10:44.837 --> 02:10:49.600]  You want to use the cannon, the artillery, or the tank, or the helicopter to get kids to join.
[02:10:50.964 --> 02:10:57.128]  This is the technocrats on top, but you don't want that tank or that helicopter or that howitzer to actually work.
[02:10:57.128 --> 02:11:08.434]  And so, yes, and I know so many soldiers, so many people that have been in every branch of the service, as you name it, from the lowest level cooks to the most secret, you know, teams.
[02:11:08.434 --> 02:11:12.056]  And it's well known that some officers were like, we're not taking this and I'm not either.
[02:11:12.056 --> 02:11:12.557]  Throw it away.
[02:11:12.557 --> 02:11:14.538]  We're going to lie and put in the forms we did.
[02:11:16.021 --> 02:11:24.003]  To those that would make them do it, but they would routinely in formations, and this has come out in the news, have people die.
[02:11:24.003 --> 02:11:28.164]  Like a platoon gets shots and one person dies, 10 are in the hospital.
[02:11:28.164 --> 02:11:33.306]  Because they aren't just getting the regular vaccines, they're getting tested on.
[02:11:33.306 --> 02:11:37.347]  And so yeah, you join the military, it's not that our military's bad, it's not that America's bad.
[02:11:37.347 --> 02:11:44.869]  The criminals have used the secrecy of our military, they've used the stoicism of our military as a place to test on people, and you're absolutely right.
[02:11:45.869 --> 02:11:53.916]  A lot of the children and families of service people end up getting those military shots.
[02:11:53.916 --> 02:11:59.120]  And, you know, your wife got to live, I guess, a while, you know, 40 years or so.
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:02.803]  A lot of people get killed right on the spot.
[02:12:02.803 --> 02:12:05.606]  And again, it's all about how to cover it up.
[02:12:05.606 --> 02:12:07.267]  It's all a big test.
[02:12:07.267 --> 02:12:10.029]  And again, the average person in the military is not involved.
[02:12:10.029 --> 02:12:12.792]  This is all a giant technocracy program.
[02:12:14.804 --> 02:12:18.147]  And she, you know, I took care of her here in the house until she passed away.
[02:12:18.147 --> 02:12:19.528]  I wouldn't put her in a home.
[02:12:19.528 --> 02:12:25.052]  And finding out all this, I found out Lyme disease, you know, was created on that island off of New Jersey.
[02:12:25.052 --> 02:12:26.493]  Palm Island?
[02:12:26.493 --> 02:12:27.714]  Yes, Palm Island.
[02:12:27.714 --> 02:12:30.236]  It's tick-carried, weaponized.
[02:12:30.236 --> 02:12:31.277]  Exactly.
[02:12:31.277 --> 02:12:35.240]  That the ticks come over on the fowl that was on the deer, that they were testing that on.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:36.742]  And it came over here and spread.
[02:12:36.742 --> 02:12:39.444]  And this is all how I found all this out.
[02:12:39.444 --> 02:12:41.485]  And then I found you researching all this.
[02:12:41.485 --> 02:12:41.746]  And then,
[02:12:43.925 --> 02:12:51.066]  You know, you're talking about your last caller talking about, you know, jobs going overseas, and you're talking about it all the time, and then Trump trying to get it all back.
[02:12:51.066 --> 02:12:51.946]  I was part of that.
[02:12:51.946 --> 02:12:56.087]  I got laid off in 1981 from a steel mill in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:12:56.087 --> 02:12:57.367]  See, that's nice steel.
[02:12:57.367 --> 02:13:09.969]  There was 7,000 men working in that steel mill when I was there, and they laid off 2,500 of us for the first whack when they started shutting all those steel mills down due to foreign steel.
[02:13:09.969 --> 02:13:13.290]  And then, as a result of that, we started getting this crappy steel over here.
[02:13:14.167 --> 02:13:18.689]  And it was, uh, the rails for the railroad was crumbling apart and stuff.
[02:13:18.689 --> 02:13:22.511]  So they decided to open that part of the mill back up and leave it going.
[02:13:22.511 --> 02:13:29.535]  But you get flat iron and all that kind of stuff come in with steel forks and knives and this flat sheet metal.
[02:13:29.535 --> 02:13:29.955]  Absolutely.
[02:13:29.955 --> 02:13:31.396]  It's all a big giant scam.
[02:13:31.396 --> 02:13:33.437]  China and all of them just sell us pure crap.
[02:13:33.437 --> 02:13:42.062]  Just like China executes you and even have opiates because that's how the British East India Company took control of China was shipping those drugs in.
[02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:51.175]  But they ship all this synthetic heroin over here in massive amounts, literally as a chemical weapon against us.
[02:13:51.175 --> 02:13:53.236]  But you know, you lost your wife.
[02:13:53.236 --> 02:13:53.897]  I think you're right.
[02:13:53.897 --> 02:13:55.818]  Clearly the vaccines.
[02:13:55.818 --> 02:13:58.860]  They told my grandmother that she got polio from the vaccine.
[02:14:00.185 --> 02:14:05.846]  Lou Ferrigno just almost got killed by a vaccine and it's just crazy how we're all just kind of calm about it.
[02:14:05.846 --> 02:14:08.387]  You know what I'm not saying you're bad or I'm bad or anybody's bad.
[02:14:08.387 --> 02:14:15.829]  I'm just saying look at how we just just because we're we're conservatives or we're Christians and we just kind of well that's the way it is.
[02:14:15.829 --> 02:14:17.069]  Who's behind this?
[02:14:17.069 --> 02:14:18.930]  Because they know what they're doing.
[02:14:18.930 --> 02:14:20.890]  They admit in their white papers they're doing this.
[02:14:20.890 --> 02:14:22.891]  Well how about we start researching
[02:14:24.673 --> 02:14:39.381]  The people that are involved in this, and who they are, and making a list and checking it twice, show that as they try to build the collapse of civilization, to use their Islamic terror rings or whatever, just like the Yellow Vest, there's a two-way street there.
[02:14:39.381 --> 02:14:43.583]  And I'm not calling for any offensive operations at this time.
[02:14:43.583 --> 02:14:47.045]  And I'll never sit here and try to command people or tell them the time or place.
[02:14:47.045 --> 02:14:48.306]  Everybody's got it in their own gut.
[02:14:49.244 --> 02:14:56.272]  But I'm telling you, these eugenicists, these mad scientists, they want to hide behind the politicians and carry all this stuff out.
[02:14:56.272 --> 02:14:58.374]  I'm telling you.
[02:14:58.374 --> 02:15:00.036]  I'm telling you, they need to be exposed.
[02:15:00.036 --> 02:15:01.618]  They need to be looked at.
[02:15:01.618 --> 02:15:02.839]  They need to be stood up against.
[02:15:02.839 --> 02:15:06.944]  Because another reason we're under attack is we exposed the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:15:06.944 --> 02:15:09.126]  But Wildman, God bless you and I appreciate you calling.
[02:15:09.126 --> 02:15:09.467]  Great call.
[02:15:11.969 --> 02:15:13.810]  So many callers, so little time here.
[02:15:13.810 --> 02:15:18.432]  We got Matt in Ohio, and Kathleen, and a bunch of others, and Sean.
[02:15:18.432 --> 02:15:19.713]  We'll go to break, come back with your calls.
[02:15:19.713 --> 02:15:20.954]  Please don't forget, just briefly.

[02:15:35.972 --> 02:15:37.693]  And we've never had prices this low.
[02:15:37.693 --> 02:15:38.953]  Inventory clear out of the year.

[02:16:04.444 --> 02:16:05.844]  The bug assault.
[02:16:05.844 --> 02:16:10.547]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[02:16:11.483 --> 02:16:12.083]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:12.083 --> 02:16:15.625]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:15.625 --> 02:16:16.665]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:16.665 --> 02:16:19.007]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:35.194 --> 02:16:40.776]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:40.776 --> 02:16:41.957]  I can help you, too.
[02:16:41.957 --> 02:16:44.898]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:16:44.898 --> 02:16:47.119]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:17:57.250 --> 02:18:03.212]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important Infowars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[02:18:03.212 --> 02:18:05.012]  So I'll say it short and sweet.
[02:18:05.012 --> 02:18:07.373]  We need your support now, more than ever.
[02:18:07.373 --> 02:18:10.214]  You've come through a thousand times, so I'm not bitching at you.
[02:18:10.214 --> 02:18:13.214]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[02:18:13.214 --> 02:18:17.055]  The attacks on Infowars have become absolutely exponential.
[02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:18.896]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[02:18:19.699 --> 02:18:32.124]  But I know, and God has really put it on my heart, that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[02:18:32.124 --> 02:18:34.045]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[02:18:34.045 --> 02:18:35.425]  I need to be provisioned.
[02:18:35.425 --> 02:18:39.747]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[02:18:39.747 --> 02:18:40.607]  But I need your prayers.
[02:18:40.607 --> 02:18:42.488]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[02:18:42.488 --> 02:18:44.469]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:45.209]  We make it easy.
[02:18:45.769 --> 02:18:52.513]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the Globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon, and you'll help provision us.
[02:18:52.513 --> 02:18:56.495]  We've got a bunch of huge deals, InfoWarsTore.com, so please take action right now.
[02:18:56.495 --> 02:19:04.840]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[02:19:05.524 --> 02:19:06.865]  We've been proven dead on.
[02:19:06.865 --> 02:19:10.747]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[02:19:10.747 --> 02:19:15.370]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[02:19:15.370 --> 02:19:17.251]  Words are not enough.
[02:19:17.251 --> 02:19:29.778]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open, free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[02:19:29.778 --> 02:19:33.000]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[02:19:33.612 --> 02:19:35.553]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[02:19:35.553 --> 02:19:39.994]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the global anti-human future.
[02:19:39.994 --> 02:19:45.835]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[02:19:45.835 --> 02:19:47.036]  I am in your hands.
[02:19:47.036 --> 02:20:00.059]  And we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[02:20:00.059 --> 02:20:02.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:19.080]  You know, I tend to get lost.
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:20.781]  And I don't want to talk about myself.
[02:20:20.781 --> 02:20:21.401]  I'm not doing that.
[02:20:21.401 --> 02:20:28.562]  I want you to know why I hate myself sometimes.
[02:20:28.562 --> 02:20:30.523]  Because I listen to a rebroadcast sometimes.
[02:20:47.483 --> 02:20:52.565]  And I think I was about to talk about one subject and I go off on another.
[02:20:52.565 --> 02:20:53.486]  But here's why.
[02:20:53.486 --> 02:20:55.407]  I'm not lying.
[02:20:55.407 --> 02:21:00.529]  So then when I pull up data, I see a whole bunch of data.
[02:21:00.529 --> 02:21:03.731]  And then I'll tend to like not go in the direction I wanted to.
[02:21:03.731 --> 02:21:05.632]  I'll just start talking about what I know.
[02:21:05.632 --> 02:21:09.954]  And I think most of you get that.
[02:21:09.954 --> 02:21:12.395]  But it's like yesterday I talked about the Seventh Day Adventist and how
[02:21:13.564 --> 02:21:20.052]  They allowed themselves to be tested on and some died in secret experiments because they thought that was Christ-like.
[02:21:20.052 --> 02:21:22.996]  And they were conscientious objectors that didn't want to kill people in war.
[02:21:22.996 --> 02:21:27.942]  Then I went on to say, but some of them, you know, obviously were used as assassins.
[02:21:27.942 --> 02:21:28.803]  And I heard that later.
[02:21:28.803 --> 02:21:32.948]  And I'm like, well, that's not entirely accurate.
[02:21:34.534 --> 02:21:42.359]  People recruited out of those programs get it, but you can say that that was someone not following the Seventh-day Adventist religion.
[02:21:42.359 --> 02:21:50.724]  So then, and I'm not a Seventh-day Adventist, I just happen to know about it, and it's historical, and I've read about it, and I grew up in Dallas with some inside baseball with the Seventh-day Adventists.
[02:21:51.886 --> 02:21:53.407]  Who've definitely got their crap together.
[02:21:53.407 --> 02:21:55.628]  I don't know of any other.
[02:21:55.628 --> 02:22:00.831]  People think Jews are like, per capita, are really active and rich and powerful and smart.
[02:22:00.831 --> 02:22:03.273]  Seventh-day Adventists are like, jumping jacks, man.
[02:22:03.273 --> 02:22:06.875]  They're just running around, involved in everything.
[02:22:06.875 --> 02:22:09.296]  But I'm digressing.
[02:22:09.296 --> 02:22:13.118]  The point is, I want to say one thing on air, and I ended up saying another thing on air.
[02:22:13.118 --> 02:22:14.239]  So I'm just going to go back to your calls.
[02:22:14.239 --> 02:22:18.261]  But I want to say this point, because it's so important.
[02:22:18.261 --> 02:22:19.362]  I talked about Plato.
[02:22:21.169 --> 02:22:35.358]  Not Plato, Plato, the most famous progenitor, the fount, the king daddy, the great granddaddy of the system of philosophy that we get from the Greeks.
[02:22:35.358 --> 02:22:39.320]  And man, you read his four or five books, and I've read most of it.
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:40.261]  I skipped past some of it.
[02:22:40.261 --> 02:22:44.343]  By God, it's heady stuff.
[02:22:44.343 --> 02:22:49.666]  And you know the mindset of the globalist.
[02:22:49.666 --> 02:22:50.767]  And I want to be more clear on that.
[02:22:52.441 --> 02:23:05.190]  You then read something like Sir Thomas Malthus, 350 years ago, and then you're like, oh, it's the same thing.
[02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:06.731]  It's a school of thought.
[02:23:06.731 --> 02:23:14.036]  You wonder, like, how do they put cancer viruses in vaccines?
[02:23:14.036 --> 02:23:15.837]  Why would they have compartmentalization?
[02:23:15.837 --> 02:23:17.558]  Why would they do all this horrible stuff?
[02:23:17.558 --> 02:23:21.321]  You gotta understand, Plato said this should be done.
[02:23:23.143 --> 02:23:24.704]  2,300 years ago.
[02:23:24.704 --> 02:23:26.745]  And then Malthus said it.
[02:23:26.745 --> 02:23:30.006]  You heard of Malthusianism?
[02:23:30.006 --> 02:23:42.012]  He said the health departments should be set up to crowd poor people in together and cut their food off and starve them to death and then give them smallpox blankets.
[02:23:42.012 --> 02:23:46.094]  What, you just think they thought of that in the French and Indian War a hundred years later?
[02:23:46.094 --> 02:23:49.015]  In Canada and the US?
[02:23:49.015 --> 02:23:49.135]  No.
[02:23:51.667 --> 02:23:58.653]  Once you know the school of thought, now you know why Hitler did it.
[02:23:58.653 --> 02:24:06.219]  Now you know why, because they were trained in it.
[02:24:06.219 --> 02:24:13.725]  Now it depends on how you apply that school of thought.
[02:24:13.725 --> 02:24:15.386]  There's the Renaissance school of thought.
[02:24:16.758 --> 02:24:18.318]  Empower the individual.
[02:24:18.318 --> 02:24:19.559]  Build humanity.
[02:24:19.559 --> 02:24:21.639]  Give as much independence to individuals as you can.
[02:24:21.639 --> 02:24:23.300]  That makes them great.
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:24.560]  The Malthusians come in.
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:25.660]  The Eugenicists come in.
[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:29.481]  The Platoites come in.
[02:24:29.481 --> 02:24:31.442]  And they go, oh, we got to be nice to everyone.
[02:24:31.442 --> 02:24:32.962]  Take control of them.
[02:24:32.962 --> 02:24:37.583]  That's actually a form of domination to dumb them down and make sure they don't compete with you.
[02:24:37.583 --> 02:24:41.204]  And under Social Darwinism, which is just, again, Malthusianism or Plato,
[02:24:43.021 --> 02:24:54.249]  If you can beat somebody, no matter how you do it, dirty, whatever, it means you're dominant, social Darwinism, you're in charge, and you deserve to be in power.
[02:24:54.249 --> 02:25:07.618]  So if they can lie to us and sell us AI and break up our families and get our kids on smartphones and have them all brainwashed when none of the Google or Facebook or Apple people let their kids get near them, you deserve to die!
[02:25:07.618 --> 02:25:09.219]  You're chained up in Plato's cave.
[02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:13.212]  Well, they project a movie screen.
[02:25:13.212 --> 02:25:16.273]  He invented the first movie screen.
[02:25:16.273 --> 02:25:18.014]  Bingo!
[02:25:18.014 --> 02:25:20.776]  Truth was, they were already doing it in theater back then.
[02:25:20.776 --> 02:25:32.662]  You'd have a big fire, and behind it you'd have brass plates, mirrors, primitive metal mirrors that would push the firelight onto the wall.
[02:25:32.662 --> 02:25:38.085]  And people would sit in front of that, not look at the fire, and
[02:25:39.926 --> 02:25:45.250]  People would basically do like you do with your kids in front of a projector or a light where you do like dinosaurs fighting or whatever.
[02:25:45.250 --> 02:25:48.552]  And they would bring in puppets and things and do puppet shows.
[02:25:48.552 --> 02:25:51.414]  The old Greek puppet shows weren't people with puppets.
[02:25:51.414 --> 02:25:52.635]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:25:52.635 --> 02:25:59.579]  It's puppets projected through light onto a screen, the movie theater.
[02:25:59.579 --> 02:26:06.304]  And he said the people that are most into that are mesmerized, are hypnotized.
[02:26:08.208 --> 02:26:28.203]  And he said, that is a allegory for how we, the illuminated, this is their own contemporary system, not a Jewish cosmology of Lucifer, but still, Lucifer meaning light, we, those of light, are the fire.
[02:26:28.203 --> 02:26:36.850]  And while we live up on the surface, they're down there with our reflected light, with what we decide to show them, and we govern their entire future.
[02:26:37.887 --> 02:26:42.350]  And what did he call for?
[02:26:42.350 --> 02:26:44.331]  Everything we now live under.
[02:26:44.331 --> 02:26:48.993]  He envisioned everything.
[02:26:48.993 --> 02:27:01.581]  He said we'll find the secrets of what makes good breeding, but in the process we'll have to exterminate the general public, so we'll have to use games entertainment in the process to further dumb them down.
[02:27:02.932 --> 02:27:06.333]  And then he discussed the different processes to carry it out.
[02:27:06.333 --> 02:27:08.794]  And let me tell you, you're living in Plato's world.
[02:27:08.794 --> 02:27:12.715]  Somebody ought to write a book called, It's Plato's Planet.
[02:27:12.715 --> 02:27:15.075]  Plato.
[02:27:15.075 --> 02:27:17.016]  Plato.
[02:27:17.016 --> 02:27:18.816]  Plato.
[02:27:18.816 --> 02:27:20.257]  Plato.
[02:27:20.257 --> 02:27:23.138]  You can sit here and look at any of this other stuff.
[02:27:23.138 --> 02:27:27.779]  It'll never make sense until you read 800 page books written by that guy.
[02:27:27.779 --> 02:27:31.080]  And you're like, oh my goodness, this guy.
[02:27:32.159 --> 02:27:33.320]  Everything he wrote.
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:38.946]  There weren't many books going back over the thousands of years, but Plato's books survived.
[02:27:38.946 --> 02:27:53.381]  And whether it was in Japan 500 years ago, or China 500 years ago, or Tsarist Russia 500 years ago, or Imperial England 500 years ago, or Imperial Spain, or Imperial Portugal, or the Dutch colonies, everyone read it.
[02:27:53.381 --> 02:27:54.683]  And it's the system.
[02:27:55.839 --> 02:27:57.940]  And we live under this system.
[02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:07.804]  And that's why the globalists have come to me off-record, sometimes on-record, so I've said some of the names, and said, listen, you get all this, you need to come join us.
[02:28:07.804 --> 02:28:13.726]  And these are good-looking people, dressed perfectly, super nice, they seem genuine, they don't even seem evil.
[02:28:13.726 --> 02:28:16.948]  Their minions are.
[02:28:16.948 --> 02:28:19.829]  But they have decided that you're scum.
[02:28:19.829 --> 02:28:20.449]  Yeah, there's Galton.
[02:28:24.304 --> 02:28:28.427]  And they're quarterbacking the whole show.
[02:28:28.427 --> 02:28:33.390]  And so you have to understand, what you're hearing here is not my opinion.
[02:28:33.390 --> 02:28:40.195]  This is what the people that built the whole future of the world had planned.
[02:28:40.195 --> 02:28:48.941]  But, about 300 years after Plato, other people came along that had visions of how to stop it.
[02:28:48.941 --> 02:28:53.184]  Because God's not going to leave us in a situation like this without a manual to stop it.
[02:28:55.786 --> 02:28:59.627]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[02:28:59.627 --> 02:29:03.348]  It's creating 10.8 billion dollars in new wealth a year.
[02:29:03.348 --> 02:29:07.970]  And every day, it's transforming more and more Americans into millionaires.
[02:29:07.970 --> 02:29:13.851]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become one of them.

[02:29:53.332 --> 02:30:04.922]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:04.922 --> 02:30:06.403]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:06.403 --> 02:30:11.107]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:11.107 --> 02:30:16.112]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at InfoWareStore.com, I still have that energy.

[02:32:59.444 --> 02:33:12.294]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:12.294 --> 02:33:16.357]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:16.357 --> 02:33:20.600]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:22.382]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.208 --> 02:33:49.872]  So, top UK official admits that bringing in more illegal aliens drives down wages.
[02:33:49.872 --> 02:33:52.173]  That's on newswars.com.
[02:33:52.173 --> 02:34:00.817]  Endless supply of cheap labor damages native population and doesn't help the third world population.
[02:34:00.817 --> 02:34:03.838]  But we know that.
[02:34:03.838 --> 02:34:09.541]  It helps the globalists who don't want a vibrant middle class that politically always demands freedom.
[02:34:11.716 --> 02:34:15.657]  And a stairway to the poor.
[02:34:15.657 --> 02:34:20.719]  The globalists want a post-industrial world for all of us.
[02:34:20.719 --> 02:34:27.381]  But then you see Bernie Sanders and Alexander Cortez.
[02:34:27.381 --> 02:34:28.321]  Bernie Sanders is evil.
[02:34:28.321 --> 02:34:29.122]  He knows what he's doing.
[02:34:29.122 --> 02:34:29.722]  It's Cortez.
[02:34:29.722 --> 02:34:33.663]  It's just unbelievably stupid.
[02:34:33.663 --> 02:34:36.224]  And you notice she's up there.
[02:34:38.004 --> 02:34:39.685]  Saying, why are you afraid of socialism?
[02:34:39.685 --> 02:34:44.147]  And the meme is, because socialists eat their dogs, we walk them.
[02:34:44.147 --> 02:34:47.389]  Capitalists walk them.
[02:34:47.389 --> 02:34:53.792]  But Sanders, he's a whole other kettle of fish.
[02:34:53.792 --> 02:35:01.496]  And they're out there running their mouths constantly about how great socialism is and how great open borders are.
[02:35:01.496 --> 02:35:03.177]  And basically what they do is they cut your legs off.
[02:35:03.177 --> 02:35:06.158]  Sanders is always like, we need a minimum wage of $15.
[02:35:10.882 --> 02:35:20.968]  But he doesn't tell you, because most people don't run a business, that you've then got to pay about $7, $8, $9, $10 and other taxes and regulations and stuff on that employee.
[02:35:20.968 --> 02:35:24.411]  So a $15 employee is about a $23 employee in Texas.
[02:35:24.411 --> 02:35:27.573]  It's higher in some states.
[02:35:27.573 --> 02:35:29.714]  Yeah, you pay somebody $15 an hour, it's $23.
[02:35:29.714 --> 02:35:32.676]  I pay crew members $30, $40 an hour on average.
[02:35:32.676 --> 02:35:33.977]  I'm paying like $50 an hour.
[02:35:35.083 --> 02:35:36.644]  That's what people don't see.
[02:35:36.644 --> 02:35:38.086]  So what you do is you don't open.
[02:35:38.086 --> 02:35:39.307]  You don't hire people.
[02:35:39.307 --> 02:35:55.480]  The owner works all the time in his own hamburger place because he can't afford the three or four jerk-offs that are all going to screw around and pick boogers and play video games the whole time when he could do the job of three people and actually pay for his daughter's tuition.
[02:35:59.633 --> 02:36:13.025]  But the average person, the average 16-year-old zit-faced, you know, person, looks up and goes, Bernie Sanders wants to give me free health care and free college, and he says I need $15, but this local diner is only going to pay me $9.
[02:36:13.025 --> 02:36:18.630]  Yeah, kid, because after all the taxes and crap, you're getting paid $15.
[02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:22.214]  But see, kid, you'll never get the job now, because there isn't going to be one there for you.
[02:36:22.987 --> 02:36:26.630]  So, rising economy raises wages regardless.
[02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:27.931]  That's the healthy way.
[02:36:27.931 --> 02:36:32.194]  But instead, oh, Bernie Sanders, he's gonna get you $15 an hour.
[02:36:32.194 --> 02:36:35.376]  It's just the job then won't exist, Sonny boy.
[02:36:35.376 --> 02:36:44.143]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls.
[02:36:44.143 --> 02:36:45.304]  I apologize, I'm out of control.
[02:36:45.304 --> 02:36:50.407]  Let's talk to Kathleen in California, then we'll go to Sean and Ethan and others.
[02:36:50.407 --> 02:36:51.228]  Kathleen, thanks for holding.
[02:36:52.496 --> 02:36:53.257]  Thank you.
[02:36:53.257 --> 02:36:55.838]  This is my first time speaking with you.
[02:36:55.838 --> 02:37:16.592]  I've been trying to reach you before because I have so much to say and I understand why you jump around because the public's basically, you know, overwhelmed with the amount of destruction and with the financial terrorism, vaccines, the educational system.
[02:37:17.390 --> 02:37:30.876]  And, you know, getting people arguing and conflicting with each other while these guys are behind the scenes or doing all these hidden, covert things against us.
[02:37:30.876 --> 02:37:41.662]  And so I understand, you know, with the wavelengths, the electromagnetic fields and the matrix so that they can implant us with ideas.
[02:37:42.995 --> 02:37:49.139]  The TV, people watch TV, you're hypnotized by it.
[02:37:49.139 --> 02:37:51.080]  Everything you say.
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:53.162]  I've been saying things for years.
[02:37:53.162 --> 02:38:01.487]  I'm an herbal nutritionist and I've created many products and your products are absolutely fantastic.
[02:38:02.379 --> 02:38:04.500]  I recommend them to my clients.
[02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:06.061]  I have them order them.
[02:38:06.061 --> 02:38:08.463]  I order lots of products from you.
[02:38:08.463 --> 02:38:13.085]  Well ma'am, I really appreciate you saying that, but obviously I'm not a sociopath.
[02:38:13.085 --> 02:38:13.866]  But if I was...
[02:38:15.347 --> 02:38:15.747]  I don't know.
[02:38:35.262 --> 02:38:38.983]  And then if you know about the scam, the programming doesn't work against you.
[02:38:38.983 --> 02:38:39.944]  I think it irritates you.
[02:38:39.944 --> 02:38:44.726]  I know it does me, but I don't think the programming works once you're aware of it.
[02:38:44.726 --> 02:38:46.306]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:38:46.306 --> 02:38:47.447]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:38:47.447 --> 02:38:52.028]  And I think the basic on this whole thing is education.
[02:38:52.028 --> 02:38:55.190]  People understanding the words.
[02:38:55.190 --> 02:39:03.733]  And that's where they really, I think that really screwed the students and the people is the amount of
[02:39:04.746 --> 02:39:10.851]  On different subjects, the nomenclature, understanding the language itself.
[02:39:10.851 --> 02:39:19.637]  And when you pass things you don't understand, you physiologically, you mentally go blank.
[02:39:19.637 --> 02:39:21.979]  You can't comprehend.
[02:39:21.979 --> 02:39:28.184]  And if that technology is known, you can control a public with just that alone.
[02:39:30.464 --> 02:39:42.869]  And then with the vaccinations and the flu shots, which to me are vaccinations, and I've been saying for years to my clients and friends, do not get vaccinated.
[02:39:42.869 --> 02:39:44.230]  That stuff is horrible.
[02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:46.851]  They're actually creating the very problem.
[02:39:47.290 --> 02:40:02.625]  And I know in the government's records, it even showed like when they were giving the live polio vaccination to smallpox, which was outlawed in the 60s, but when they were giving the shots, the actual disease came back.
[02:40:02.625 --> 02:40:03.446]  It increased.
[02:40:03.786 --> 02:40:04.327]  Oh, I know.
[02:40:04.327 --> 02:40:06.268]  I have the newspaper articles when it happened.
[02:40:06.268 --> 02:40:08.810]  Listen, my grandmother was an awesome lady.
[02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:13.234]  I mean, she was a beauty queen, super Christian, loving lady.
[02:40:13.234 --> 02:40:16.937]  And, you know, she had two children with my grandfather, and then it just devastated her life.
[02:40:16.937 --> 02:40:18.619]  She almost died.
[02:40:18.619 --> 02:40:23.323]  And the doctors told her, the vaccine gave it to you, but it's for the greater good, honey.
[02:40:23.323 --> 02:40:25.745]  And it's just so sick.
[02:40:26.385 --> 02:40:36.995]  That when we've experienced this, we've been through this, personally, people in this office, I know two people that work here, I won't say their names, had their children die from vaccines.
[02:40:36.995 --> 02:40:40.758]  You know, Lou Ferrigno, they said, oh, you got real sick and swole up and couldn't walk.
[02:40:40.758 --> 02:40:43.641]  Someone didn't clean the spot they injected it.
[02:40:43.641 --> 02:40:45.202]  No, Lou!
[02:40:45.202 --> 02:40:46.503]  No, Lou!
[02:40:46.503 --> 02:40:48.525]  That's not what happened, buddy boy.
[02:40:48.525 --> 02:40:49.746]  Read the insert.
[02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:53.929]  And Lou will say, I can't believe it!
[02:40:53.929 --> 02:40:55.831]  It says it can give you Guillain-Barre.
[02:40:55.831 --> 02:41:00.074]  I was sore and couldn't walk and they told me it was good.
[02:41:00.074 --> 02:41:01.495]  But I'm making fun of his voice.
[02:41:01.495 --> 02:41:03.076]  That's how he talks.
[02:41:03.076 --> 02:41:10.321]  And you know, just in the final equation, stop being so trusting, Lou, because you're a big, gentle giant.
[02:41:10.321 --> 02:41:11.702]  I come from a good family, good people.
[02:41:11.702 --> 02:41:13.703]  A lot of people that know Lou Ferrigno's family.
[02:41:13.703 --> 02:41:17.265]  Just because you're a nice guy doesn't mean people outside your head are nice, buddy.
[02:41:17.265 --> 02:41:17.726]  Grow up!
[02:41:18.666 --> 02:41:20.047]  For your dead!
[02:41:20.047 --> 02:41:21.728]  God bless you, Kathleen, I appreciate your call.
[02:41:21.728 --> 02:41:24.690]  Oh, God.
[02:41:24.690 --> 02:41:31.655]  You know, I wanted to play this Mark Dice piece about the attack on the First Amendment and also Tucker Carlson, but I also want to go to your phone calls.
[02:41:31.655 --> 02:41:34.497]  And we've got Matt Bracken coming up, so let's do this.
[02:41:34.497 --> 02:41:35.258]  Call Matt Bracken.
[02:41:36.428 --> 02:41:39.069]  He loves calls, but see if he wants these calls.
[02:41:39.069 --> 02:41:40.490]  If he doesn't, I'm going to have to let everybody go.
[02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:41.150]  It's our fault.
[02:41:41.150 --> 02:41:42.350]  We've got like 20 phone lines.
[02:41:42.350 --> 02:41:43.611]  But I appreciate everybody calling.
[02:41:43.611 --> 02:41:44.311]  So just stay on hold.
[02:41:44.311 --> 02:41:46.672]  We'll find out if Matt's going to want to talk to you.
[02:41:46.672 --> 02:41:48.493]  He's a really smart guy on all these topics.
[02:41:48.493 --> 02:41:52.055]  Or if whatever needs to happen is going to happen.
[02:41:52.055 --> 02:41:55.976]  But I mean, I do care.
[02:41:55.976 --> 02:41:57.137]  I do feel.
[02:41:57.137 --> 02:41:59.598]  And I don't say that in some virtue signaling.
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:08.725]  I mean, I love people, and I love the average person, but I also then feel very aggressive and very angry towards bad people.
[02:42:08.725 --> 02:42:22.916]  And I only tell you that because I know sometimes the show can be a train wreck, but I just, I thank God every morning that at least we have conscience, a connection to God, at least we have a soul.
[02:42:23.786 --> 02:42:25.427]  So I thank the crew for the great job they've done.
[02:42:25.427 --> 02:42:29.010]  Everybody else, there's so much more coming up with this Tucker Carlson piece, this Mark Dyche piece.
[02:42:29.010 --> 02:42:30.812]  They're very powerful.
[02:42:30.812 --> 02:42:31.973]  And again, you've stood with us.
[02:42:31.973 --> 02:42:32.713]  You're so amazing.
[02:42:32.713 --> 02:42:35.596]  You humble me, listeners.
[02:42:35.596 --> 02:42:37.137]  All the calls today have been the best ever.
[02:42:37.137 --> 02:42:44.103]  You humble me and you really make me very, very thankful to be alive and you give me hope.
[02:42:44.103 --> 02:42:48.646]  So I want to salute you and the crew and all the local radio stations and TV stations.
[02:42:48.646 --> 02:42:50.107]  If you're listening to local radio stations,
[02:42:51.187 --> 02:42:53.508]  Spread the word about those stations and support them.
[02:42:53.508 --> 02:42:55.289]  Thank you.
[02:42:55.289 --> 02:43:04.335]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[02:43:04.335 --> 02:43:05.655]  We've been proven dead on.
[02:43:05.655 --> 02:43:09.538]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[02:43:09.538 --> 02:43:14.160]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:15.221]  Words are not enough.
[02:43:16.051 --> 02:43:22.216]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[02:43:22.216 --> 02:43:28.420]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:32.423]  They've created their Tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[02:43:32.423 --> 02:43:34.344]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[02:43:34.344 --> 02:43:38.367]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[02:43:38.929 --> 02:43:44.593]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[02:43:44.593 --> 02:43:53.880]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[02:43:55.041 --> 02:44:01.449]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:44:01.449 --> 02:44:02.991]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:44:02.991 --> 02:44:07.897]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[02:44:07.897 --> 02:44:10.821]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[02:44:11.361 --> 02:44:14.103]  A free gift with every order.
[02:44:14.103 --> 02:44:22.968]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:44:22.968 --> 02:44:26.630]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:30.613]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day.
[02:44:30.613 --> 02:44:34.355]  It's there until it sells out, then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[02:44:34.915 --> 02:44:39.800]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:41.342]  So this is a loss leader.
[02:44:41.342 --> 02:44:42.904]  We are losing money on this.
[02:44:42.904 --> 02:44:44.345]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:44:44.345 --> 02:44:46.348]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[02:44:46.348 --> 02:44:47.669]  And don't fight the crowds.
[02:44:47.669 --> 02:44:49.111]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:44:49.111 --> 02:44:50.612]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[02:44:57.065 --> 02:45:01.527]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[02:45:01.527 --> 02:45:06.070]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:16.576]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:16.576 --> 02:45:20.438]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[02:45:20.438 --> 02:45:21.959]  All the sales the last 12 days
[02:45:22.739 --> 02:45:25.162]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off is back.
[02:45:25.162 --> 02:45:26.263]  Free shipping is still there.
[02:45:26.263 --> 02:45:27.645]  Double Patriot points.
[02:45:27.645 --> 02:45:30.889]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[02:45:30.889 --> 02:45:35.434]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[02:45:35.434 --> 02:45:36.895]  Just go check out the sales.
[02:45:36.895 --> 02:45:38.177]  There's too many to break them all down.
[02:45:38.177 --> 02:45:42.021]  Get your orders in by the 19th, so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[02:45:42.742 --> 02:45:44.764]  And thank you again all for your support.
[02:45:44.764 --> 02:45:49.227]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[02:45:49.227 --> 02:45:53.890]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the Globals together.
[02:45:53.890 --> 02:45:54.170]  Thank you.
[02:46:03.692 --> 02:46:05.192]  That wants to hurt children.
[02:46:05.192 --> 02:46:06.333]  They want to abort children.
[02:46:06.333 --> 02:46:08.073]  They want to disease children.
[02:46:08.073 --> 02:46:09.193]  They want to abuse children.
[02:46:09.193 --> 02:46:10.834]  They want to confuse children.
[02:46:10.834 --> 02:46:11.994]  They want their essence.
[02:46:11.994 --> 02:46:12.954]  They want their soul.
[02:46:12.954 --> 02:46:14.274]  They want their spirit.
[02:46:14.274 --> 02:46:16.035]  They want their power.
[02:46:16.035 --> 02:46:18.275]  Because they are our future.
[02:46:18.275 --> 02:46:21.936]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, our ultimate sacrifice.
[02:46:21.936 --> 02:46:23.757]  It is about the West.
[02:46:23.757 --> 02:46:27.918]  It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[02:46:27.918 --> 02:46:29.478]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[02:46:30.689 --> 02:46:41.212]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[02:46:41.212 --> 02:46:43.273]  You have the power to override the censors.
[02:46:43.273 --> 02:46:46.354]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[02:46:46.354 --> 02:46:55.417]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[02:46:59.426 --> 02:47:02.729]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:02.729 --> 02:47:13.837]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:13.837 --> 02:47:15.178]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:20.566 --> 02:47:24.029]  If you grew up in this country, you remember hearing it when you were a kid.
[02:47:24.029 --> 02:47:25.750]  This is a free country.
[02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:27.732]  The Constitution gives us freedom.
[02:47:27.732 --> 02:47:33.296]  And the first freedom, literally the first number in the Bill of Rights, is freedom of speech.
[02:47:33.296 --> 02:47:35.297]  And for generations, that was unquestioned here.
[02:47:35.297 --> 02:47:38.020]  It was the most celebrated of our rights.
[02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:43.264]  But increasingly, it is seen by the people in charge as an annoying relic.
[02:47:43.264 --> 02:47:44.164]  Don't believe us?
[02:47:44.164 --> 02:47:48.708]  Try to say something unauthorized in your workplace, or on campus, or even on a street corner.
[02:47:49.890 --> 02:47:51.531]  Why have things changed?
[02:47:51.531 --> 02:47:54.053]  Well, because the attitudes of our leaders have changed.
[02:47:54.053 --> 02:47:58.496]  And we have a small clip that tells you a lot about what they really believe.
[02:47:58.496 --> 02:48:10.124]  This is California Congressman Ted Lieu, and he's explaining in this clip that sadly he's prevented from banning talk he doesn't like by a pesky legal antique called the Constitution.
[02:48:10.124 --> 02:48:10.525]  Watch this.
[02:48:12.012 --> 02:48:16.473]  I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech.
[02:48:16.473 --> 02:48:19.374]  The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.
[02:48:19.374 --> 02:48:21.795]  And that's simply a function of the First Amendment.
[02:48:21.795 --> 02:48:27.017]  But I think over the long run, it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech.
[02:48:29.659 --> 02:48:33.660]  The CNN anchor just sort of nods, like, of course, we'd all like to regulate speech if we could.
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:37.621]  Over the long run, he says, it's better not to regulate speech, end quote.
[02:48:37.621 --> 02:48:43.323]  Does that sound like someone who is deeply committed to a free society and its benefits?
[02:48:43.323 --> 02:48:50.645]  Or is it simply a bully admitting that, for now, the law won't let him do what he wants to do, which is control your mind?
[02:48:50.645 --> 02:48:51.386]  I think you know the answer.
[02:48:52.586 --> 02:48:58.011]  Well, the left increasingly is using big tech, threats, and public shaming to stamp out political views it doesn't like.
[02:48:58.011 --> 02:49:04.617]  They're also ruining actors and comedians and anyone else who dares stray from the script.
[02:49:04.617 --> 02:49:06.679]  But not everybody is so limited.
[02:49:06.679 --> 02:49:10.983]  We learned that today when one cable host used a slur to describe a member of the Trump administration.
[02:49:12.768 --> 02:49:16.053]  Why doesn't Mike Pompeo care right now?
[02:49:16.053 --> 02:49:24.003]  Are the pathetic deflections that we just heard when he appeared on Fox & Friends, is that a patriot speaking?
[02:49:24.003 --> 02:49:25.926]  Or a wannabe dictator's butt boy?
[02:49:25.926 --> 02:49:30.172]  I'm dead serious, I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot?
[02:49:32.225 --> 02:49:36.866]  So, the anchor apologized for that remark.
[02:49:36.866 --> 02:49:38.567]  But the question is, will she be punished?
[02:49:38.567 --> 02:49:41.668]  And of course, needless to say, we don't think she should be punished.
[02:49:41.668 --> 02:49:43.528]  She was saying what she thinks, or she misspoke.
[02:49:43.528 --> 02:49:45.129]  It happens to everybody.
[02:49:45.129 --> 02:49:46.529]  She shouldn't face sanction for that.
[02:49:46.529 --> 02:49:48.950]  But then, neither should Kevin Hart.
[02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:55.652]  But the left now has a long history as the only faction enjoying impunity for what it says.
[02:49:57.702 --> 02:50:00.863]  You talk like a sign language gorilla who got hit in the head.
[02:50:00.863 --> 02:50:08.945]  In fact, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's **** holster.
[02:50:08.945 --> 02:50:12.026]  You give him a damn robe and you let him do whatever the hell he wants.
[02:50:12.026 --> 02:50:18.168]  Because this right now, this is my audition for Mr. Trump's cabinet.
[02:50:18.168 --> 02:50:21.209]  And also for a regional production of The Crucible.
[02:50:21.209 --> 02:50:25.730]  And let me tell you, Queen, I was good.
[02:50:28.717 --> 02:50:34.398]  Dave Rubin hosts the Rubin Report on YouTube, which everyone watching has watched because it's excellent and he joins us today.
[02:50:34.398 --> 02:50:36.078]  Dave, thanks a lot for coming on.
[02:50:36.078 --> 02:50:43.880]  So just to be totally clear, I think people are able to tell jokes that I don't like, and often they do.
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:54.062]  What I find so interesting is at this moment of peak hysteria about speech, where you're seeing normal, decent, totally non-bigoted people destroyed and the rest of us are completely terrified, and art
[02:50:54.682 --> 02:50:56.602]  And free expression is totally ground to a halt.
[02:50:56.602 --> 02:50:57.803]  Aesthetics are suffering.
[02:50:57.803 --> 02:50:59.123]  No one can be creative anymore.
[02:50:59.123 --> 02:51:05.484]  At that exact moment, the left still feels totally free to say things that they would classify if others said them as bigoted.
[02:51:05.484 --> 02:51:07.545]  What's going on?
[02:51:07.545 --> 02:51:08.965]  Well, you just nailed it right there.
[02:51:08.965 --> 02:51:22.948]  I mean, quite literally, the Oscars can't even figure out who to host the show anymore, either because they can't find anyone that's politically correct enough or that everyone that would like to do it is now afraid to do it because of the repercussions.
[02:51:23.508 --> 02:51:39.784]  But as for the clips that you just played, I mean, look, the simple truth of this is it's showing what the flaw of collectivism, which is basically the idea of judging people based on their immutable characteristics, why it is so terrible and why it has been embraced by the left.
[02:51:39.784 --> 02:51:42.647]  You know, you can't be for groups.
[02:51:42.647 --> 02:51:46.251]  It actually doesn't make sense because you will eliminate the individual every time.
[02:51:47.392 --> 02:51:53.555]  Four gays doesn't really mean anything because then when they want to make a joke about you, then they'll make a gay joke.
[02:51:53.555 --> 02:51:56.576]  Or to say you're four women, what they don't really, that doesn't mean anything.
[02:51:56.576 --> 02:51:59.438]  That's a very low resolution way of saying something.
[02:51:59.438 --> 02:52:02.959]  Everyone's four women, let's say, but they're not really four women.
[02:52:02.959 --> 02:52:06.561]  Are they for Nikki Haley, a brown woman who happens to be a conservative?
[02:52:06.701 --> 02:52:06.821]  It's
[02:52:27.082 --> 02:52:30.603]  When the last time I heard something that chilling coming from a government official.
[02:52:30.603 --> 02:52:36.385]  It's like the First Amendment is the most precious thing that we have in this country.
[02:52:36.385 --> 02:52:49.728]  And I can tell you as someone that's been on tour for most of the last year and I've been to 20 some odd countries in the last couple months, every single country, the people are jealous of the freedoms that we have here and especially the freedom of speech.
[02:52:49.728 --> 02:52:51.469]  So it's like to hear anyone, regardless
[02:52:51.789 --> 02:52:53.970]  Regardless of whether he's a Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter.
[02:52:53.970 --> 02:52:59.872]  To hear any elected official saying that, you know, he'd love to get rid of the First Amendment, whoo!
[02:52:59.872 --> 02:53:03.133]  I mean, I can't imagine anything scarier in a free society, actually.
[02:53:03.133 --> 02:53:12.475]  Very quickly, I mean, and I don't want to pound on the anchor, I don't even know who it was in that clip, but it was a news anchor whose living, obviously, is predicated on the First Amendment.
[02:53:12.475 --> 02:53:17.237]  Didn't interrupt him and say, what, I'm sorry, Mr. Elected Official, did you just say you'd like to control people's speech?
[02:53:19.045 --> 02:53:22.450]  Yeah, well, it's just incredible, and we're seeing an emboldening of this.
[02:53:22.450 --> 02:53:31.922]  You know, it's interesting what you said there, that these are the same people who love to shut people down, but then at the same time they'll accidentally, or they'll intentionally say some of these things.
[02:53:31.922 --> 02:53:33.985]  You may have seen this today, Deadspin, which is just
[02:53:33.985 --> 02:53:37.867]  Just another one of these sites that just churns out a lot of sort of lefty nonsense.
[02:53:37.867 --> 02:53:46.753]  They ran a piece today that basically said, the title of the piece was something to the effect of, uh, conservative gays should shut the F up.
[02:53:46.753 --> 02:53:47.873]  I mean, imagine that.
[02:53:47.873 --> 02:53:55.178]  Imagine judging people based on those immutable characteristics while at the same time telling those people that you're supposedly their allies.
[02:53:55.538 --> 02:54:00.180]  And that's why, again, as I always say to you, Tucker, Tucker, every time I'm on your show, what do I tell you?
[02:54:00.180 --> 02:54:11.904]  For all the disagreements, the political disagreements that we might have, which we've discussed on both my show and your show, because you are a staunch defender of free speech, I will continue to do this with you whether we agree or not.
[02:54:11.904 --> 02:54:13.624]  That's what America is about.
[02:54:13.624 --> 02:54:21.147]  Democrat Congressman Ted Lieu out of California is frustrated by the fact that the First Amendment is preventing him from silencing conservatives.
[02:54:21.687 --> 02:54:27.691]  So he's urging the big tech companies to start censoring more of us on the government's behalf.
[02:54:27.691 --> 02:54:40.860]  Here he is talking with CNN's Breonna Keillor yesterday, who's disappointed in him that he didn't use his time during Tuesday's hearing with Google CEO Sanjay Pichar to pressure the tech giant to increase their censorship.
[02:54:41.707 --> 02:54:54.939]  Have you thought that maybe you and other Democrats have missed opportunities to use your time to press Google's CEO at a time when these large tech companies are struggling to manage content, perpetuating conspiracy theories.
[02:54:54.939 --> 02:54:57.341]  They're so vulnerable to outside interference.
[02:54:57.341 --> 02:54:59.783]  Isn't that a focus that could have been a missed opportunity?
[02:55:01.408 --> 02:55:03.468]  So, it's a very good point you make.
[02:55:03.468 --> 02:55:07.389]  I would love if I could have more than five minutes to question witnesses.
[02:55:07.389 --> 02:55:09.970]  Unfortunately, I don't get that opportunity.
[02:55:09.970 --> 02:55:15.671]  However, I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech.
[02:55:15.671 --> 02:55:18.591]  The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.
[02:55:18.591 --> 02:55:28.853]  I would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves, but it's really nothing that I believe government can do, and so that's been my position all along.
[02:55:29.193 --> 02:55:29.693]  Sorry, Ms.
[02:55:29.693 --> 02:55:35.455]  Keillor, if you're so concerned about conspiracy theories being spread around, you should probably stop working for CNN!
[02:55:35.455 --> 02:55:46.698]  This guy was one of Google's biggest cheerleaders during the hearing on Tuesday, who said that if conservatives don't like the search results on Google or don't like what they're seeing on social media, that we should just blame ourselves!
[02:55:46.698 --> 02:55:54.560]  And to some of my colleagues across Iowa, if you're getting bad press articles and bad search results, don't blame Google or Facebook or Twitter.
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:55.800]  Consider blaming yourself.
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:59.964]  That little outburst made him a hero amongst the Democrats.
[02:55:59.964 --> 02:56:04.929]  How Ted Lieu became Google's accidental champion, reported The Atlantic.
[02:56:04.929 --> 02:56:10.175]  This editor for Wired Magazine called it the best moment in the Sunjai-Pichai hearings.
[02:56:10.175 --> 02:56:16.862]  Yeah, it's just so cool called for the end of the First Amendment and saying that conservatives should blame themselves for being upset about that.
[02:56:17.242 --> 02:56:28.106]  And speaking of trying to undermine our republic, Senator Chuck Schumer is now tweeting in a foreign language because, well, he's a foreign agent trying to overthrow our country from within.
[02:56:28.106 --> 02:56:41.791]  And here's MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski to further illustrate the incredible double standards that the liberals have for freedom of speech, uttering a dreaded homophobic slur on the air and, of course, facing no consequences.
[02:56:42.752 --> 02:56:45.235]  I understand that Donald Trump doesn't care.
[02:56:45.235 --> 02:56:46.456]  Heilman makes a good point.
[02:56:46.456 --> 02:56:47.477]  He doesn't care.
[02:56:47.477 --> 02:56:50.981]  But why doesn't Mike Pompeo care right now?
[02:56:50.981 --> 02:56:58.930]  Are the pathetic deflections that we just heard, when he appeared on Fox & Friends, is that a patriot speaking?
[02:56:58.930 --> 02:57:00.712]  Or a wannabe dictator's butt boy?
[02:57:01.773 --> 02:57:02.574]  I'm dead serious.
[02:57:02.574 --> 02:57:05.257]  I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot?
[02:57:05.257 --> 02:57:07.700]  It sounds like they tried to mute it out, but they failed.
[02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:12.285]  And I personally couldn't care less than anybody says, as long as they're not calling for violence.
[02:57:12.285 --> 02:57:16.449]  It is unprofessional, but it's MSNBC we're talking about here.
[02:57:16.449 --> 02:57:22.736]  But imagine if some YouTuber or someone on Fox News or on Twitter dared to utter that dreaded slur.
[02:57:23.277 --> 02:57:27.480]  But Mika's job is totally fine, and MSNBC's already forgotten about it.
[02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:34.285]  And she says that she meant to call him a water boy, not a... I can't even quote her, otherwise the thought police will come after me.
[02:57:51.112 --> 02:57:53.473]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:58:47.048 --> 02:58:51.312]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:51.312 --> 02:58:54.775]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:54.775 --> 02:58:56.537]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:56.537 --> 02:58:59.820]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:59.820 --> 02:59:06.606]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:06.606 --> 02:59:11.691]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:59:12.011 --> 02:59:18.116]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:18.116 --> 02:59:20.758]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.758 --> 02:59:22.220]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:22.220 --> 02:59:26.023]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:26.023 --> 02:59:28.064]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:28.064 --> 02:59:29.345]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:29.345 --> 02:59:32.068]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:32.068 --> 02:59:35.010]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:35.010 --> 02:59:36.331]  I will never falter.
[02:59:36.331 --> 02:59:38.353]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:38.633 --> 02:59:50.178]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at 444.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:50.178 --> 02:59:52.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.448 --> 03:00:09.809]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:09.809 --> 03:00:17.372]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:00:17.372 --> 03:00:21.734]  Yeah, this is Matt Bracken in for the last hour on Friday.
[03:00:21.734 --> 03:00:31.619]  And we're into the Christmas season and I wish I was full of jolliness and good cheer, but actually I'm pretty much not.
[03:00:31.619 --> 03:00:34.180]  I've been following the news, watching the show,
[03:00:35.569 --> 03:00:39.533]  The Ted Lieu thing about wishing that we would have less free speech.
[03:00:39.533 --> 03:00:42.495]  It's deserving because that's the left today.
[03:00:42.495 --> 03:00:45.217]  They are no longer interested in a dialogue with us.
[03:00:45.217 --> 03:00:47.679]  They just want to shut us up.
[03:00:47.679 --> 03:00:51.482]  And I'm reminded of a quote from a meme that's been floating around.
[03:00:51.482 --> 03:00:59.729]  It says that genocides happen when tyrannies are coming to power and the people are disarmed.
[03:01:00.956 --> 03:01:05.479]  But civil wars happen when tyrannies are rising, but the people are armed.
[03:01:05.479 --> 03:01:10.482]  So at least it looks like we're not going to have a genocide without a civil war.
[03:01:10.482 --> 03:01:18.827]  You know, I just don't see a safe path back to the old America, you know, to the to the Democratic Republic that we knew.
[03:01:18.827 --> 03:01:28.433]  And the problem is that politically today, politicians that are on the move, they're going to see their best move
[03:01:29.719 --> 03:01:37.783]  To be appealing to their radical bases, to their extreme elements, not to appealing to the middle of America.
[03:01:37.783 --> 03:01:39.624]  That's going to be a losing proposition.
[03:01:39.624 --> 03:01:51.590]  I kind of see a parallel today in what happened in the former Yugoslavia at the end of the Cold War when communism was failing.
[03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:54.271]  A politician named Slobodan Milosevic
[03:01:55.279 --> 03:02:03.226]  He rose to power by appealing to radical Serbian ethnic pride.
[03:02:03.226 --> 03:02:08.931]  It got him to become the prime minister, but it ensured that there'd be a civil war.
[03:02:08.931 --> 03:02:13.195]  And something similar to that is going to happen, I think, in the United States, unfortunately.
[03:02:13.195 --> 03:02:17.078]  I don't see a moderate ever coming to power.
[03:02:17.078 --> 03:02:22.843]  I think that if Trump is elected for another term, it'll probably be a miracle.
[03:02:23.601 --> 03:02:30.264]  You know, the Democrats are going to be gunning for him for the next two years with all, you know, all barrels blazing.
[03:02:30.264 --> 03:02:35.407]  And you can see today how we're just in a battle of competing narratives.
[03:02:35.407 --> 03:02:42.591]  If you watch Fox or conservative media, you can see that, you know, the Uranium One scandal has never been investigated.
[03:02:42.591 --> 03:02:45.172]  Hillary Clinton got a complete walk.
[03:02:45.172 --> 03:02:49.014]  But if you turn the channel a few clicks over to watch CNN or MSNBC,
[03:02:50.083 --> 03:03:14.472]  All you'll hear is that President Trump was somehow involved with Russians, it's never really explained, that all of his cabinet members are deserting him, that he's a complete failure, that he'll probably be impeached over campaign contribution violations, which is, we know, bogus, but that's the narrative that's being floated to half of the country.
[03:03:14.472 --> 03:03:18.173]  So you can see these forces are just pulling us apart.
[03:03:18.846 --> 03:03:22.749]  And I don't see a way back to safety.
[03:03:22.749 --> 03:03:29.333]  So I guess the message today is, you know, buy some more ammunition for Christmas.
[03:03:29.333 --> 03:03:33.136]  And if you only have one AR-15, you better get another one.
[03:03:34.844 --> 03:03:40.107]  States like New Jersey, they've banned magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.
[03:03:40.107 --> 03:03:50.133]  It's just a question of time before they start arresting people, because they can tell by who's bought what where these magazines are.
[03:03:50.133 --> 03:03:56.116]  Even in my own state of Florida, they're doing these RPOs, these public safety orders.
[03:03:56.116 --> 03:04:02.200]  The initials are different in each state, but they red flag gun owners
[03:04:03.246 --> 03:04:07.029]  And literally go to their house to collect their guns.
[03:04:07.029 --> 03:04:09.651]  I don't see a soft landing out of all of this.
[03:04:09.651 --> 03:04:11.532]  I really don't.
[03:04:11.532 --> 03:04:19.878]  And if history is a guide, I think that Civil War is ahead of us, unfortunately.
[03:04:19.878 --> 03:04:22.880]  Anyway, that's my cheerful Christmas message.
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:29.165]  And we'll maybe get to the range and do some shooting and have some fun where we can.
[03:04:29.978 --> 03:04:33.465]  When we come back from the break, I'm going to take calls for the rest of the hour.
[03:04:33.465 --> 03:04:37.072]  Matt Bracken for Alex, last hour of InfoWords.
[03:04:54.448 --> 03:04:56.769]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:06:11.743 --> 03:06:14.305]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:06:14.305 --> 03:06:17.388]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:17.388 --> 03:06:28.176]  Okay, we're back and for the rest of the hour, I'm going to try to clear through the boards here on the phone calls.
[03:06:28.176 --> 03:06:34.741]  In the past, I've called into shows and I know how frustrating it can be to be listening to the show through your telephone for an hour or so.
[03:06:36.528 --> 03:06:39.190]  So let's go to Alex in Michigan first.
[03:06:39.190 --> 03:06:40.170]  Been waiting for an hour and a half.
[03:06:40.170 --> 03:06:42.252]  I think that's long enough.
[03:06:42.252 --> 03:06:44.213]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[03:06:44.213 --> 03:06:46.935]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, man.
[03:06:46.935 --> 03:06:50.877]  God bless you and God bless all the InfoWarriors out there.
[03:06:50.877 --> 03:06:54.399]  Merry Christmas.
[03:06:54.399 --> 03:07:04.605]  If you haven't already, go to the InfoWarriorsStore.com and buy yourself the X2 or the Fish Oil or the Real Red Pill or the Waterfill.
[03:07:04.605 --> 03:07:05.306]  I think I need it.
[03:07:07.274 --> 03:07:12.017]  Yes, it'll be a great Christmas gift to everyone under the tree.
[03:07:12.017 --> 03:07:16.139]  Even if they're not InfoWars listeners, it'll be a great way to spread the word.
[03:07:16.139 --> 03:07:24.304]  And I think in relation to what you're talking about, it's not really a civil war, but it's an info war.
[03:07:24.304 --> 03:07:34.810]  And so our ammunition has to be information to counter their stupid narrative that we're Russian agents or Trump violated campaign finance law.
[03:07:36.924 --> 03:07:42.947]  Hillary allegedly got like 400 million from Bill Browder out of Russia.
[03:07:42.947 --> 03:07:43.468]  Allegedly.
[03:07:43.468 --> 03:07:47.950]  So like, why is no one looking at that, you know?
[03:07:47.950 --> 03:07:51.692]  Yeah, in terms of this being an info war, you're absolutely right.
[03:07:51.692 --> 03:08:02.818]  But the problem is that we seem to be on divided tracks, like two parallel tunnels in the mountain that barely communicate and barely see each other's narrative.
[03:08:03.539 --> 03:08:07.642]  You know, people just choose the information path that they want.
[03:08:07.642 --> 03:08:13.306]  So, for a while it was, you know, a fair fight on Twitter or Facebook, but we've seen how that went.
[03:08:13.306 --> 03:08:18.289]  And as soon as you get any traction, you know, you're shadow banned or you're just kicked off completely.
[03:08:18.289 --> 03:08:24.133]  I was kicked off of Twitter just for a burqa meme that didn't even name a religion.
[03:08:24.133 --> 03:08:28.756]  You know, some Muslim objected to a meme about burqas.
[03:08:29.514 --> 03:08:31.437]  And I was gone from Twitter.
[03:08:31.437 --> 03:08:35.862]  So I don't see how we can compete in the info war when we're only talking to our own audience.
[03:08:35.862 --> 03:08:38.366]  So that's one of my main concerns right now.
[03:08:39.309 --> 03:09:01.185]  I don't know if you have any ideas other than, I mean, I promote alternative social media like, you know, using BitChute and Brighteon instead of YouTube, which is Google, Gulag, or using Gab or FreeZoxy or other social media sites instead of just, you know, Facebook and Twitter.
[03:09:01.818 --> 03:09:10.741]  But those are such tiny audiences compared to the monoliths, the Leviathans of Google, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
[03:09:10.741 --> 03:09:17.563]  I don't see how we get any traction when our volumes are dialed down on the main social media sites.
[03:09:17.563 --> 03:09:22.925]  Maybe I'm in a depressed frame of mind right now, but I don't see us making progress.
[03:09:22.925 --> 03:09:23.685]  Do you have any ideas?
[03:09:25.034 --> 03:09:27.056]  Trump definitely needs to act.
[03:09:27.056 --> 03:09:32.020]  If we could all just sign up for a lawsuit, like me, you, Alex Jones, everybody else, sign up.
[03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:35.863]  If Infowars.com sets something up, we could all sign up for a lawsuit.
[03:09:35.863 --> 03:09:36.804]  And we would totally win.
[03:09:36.804 --> 03:09:45.671]  Because that's the reason we might get into a civil war, is because we can't win the information war, so we go into a civil war.
[03:09:45.671 --> 03:09:51.996]  Yeah, if there's a... The only thing I can see Congress doing, and of course the Democrats are going to run Congress now,
[03:09:53.207 --> 03:10:05.513]  If they even try to treat big social media as a utility and have the government running it, well, that just means eventually people like Ted Lieu will be writing the law.
[03:10:05.513 --> 03:10:12.376]  And I think it'll codify politically correct ideas.
[03:10:12.376 --> 03:10:14.717]  So I think that we need to
[03:10:16.034 --> 03:10:24.544]  You know, I don't know how we can work it, because any attempts to level the playing field on Facebook, I just see it working against us in the long run.
[03:10:26.505 --> 03:10:29.626]  You know, I wish that Trump would go and declassify everything in sight.
[03:10:29.626 --> 03:10:31.707]  I mean, gosh, I'd like to see the guy take the U.S.
[03:10:31.707 --> 03:10:39.729]  Marshals into the Department of Justice and force them to turn over documents, you know, to tell them, you know, you turn them over or you're going to be arrested.
[03:10:39.729 --> 03:10:48.532]  But it just shows that even a president of the United States has less power than the bureaucracy, the entrenched deep state.
[03:10:49.227 --> 03:10:57.510]  And they've got the media, they've got still most of the FBI, Department of Justice, the intel agencies, the man's up against everything.
[03:10:57.510 --> 03:11:01.132]  And, you know, I guess sticking with Trump is the strongest thing we can do.
[03:11:01.132 --> 03:11:07.414]  But I'm at a loss for how to get more traction in the information war.
[03:11:07.414 --> 03:11:11.316]  Of course, support info wars, you know, buy products from the store.
[03:11:11.316 --> 03:11:14.037]  But it seems like we're just talking to ourselves.
[03:11:14.967 --> 03:11:20.892]  And, uh, you know, big, big media and big social media is still dominating the country.
[03:11:20.892 --> 03:11:24.335]  Anyway, go ahead.
[03:11:24.335 --> 03:11:35.043]  If Trump could, um, take military action, like arrest traitors, ideally, but if he bare minimum can't even get the information out with the FISA warrant, like you're talking about, like, that's not a good sign.
[03:11:35.043 --> 03:11:40.027]  Like if he can't get the information out for ammunition in the info war, we have no shot.
[03:11:40.027 --> 03:11:41.308]  So he's got to do that at least.
[03:11:42.622 --> 03:11:53.466]  Yeah, I think that a big move, you know, he has to be assured that Mueller doesn't have any more big aces to play, then do the big declassification.
[03:11:53.466 --> 03:11:55.147]  But I don't know why he doesn't.
[03:11:55.147 --> 03:11:59.728]  I don't know what the grip is that they've got over him that he can't do that.
[03:11:59.728 --> 03:12:00.629]  But thanks, Alex.
[03:12:00.629 --> 03:12:06.891]  And let's go to Sean and PA, also been holding for a long time.
[03:12:06.891 --> 03:12:07.411]  Go ahead, Sean.
[03:12:09.246 --> 03:12:10.547]  Hey Matt, thanks for hosting.
[03:12:10.547 --> 03:12:13.490]  You're literally my favorite guest host.
[03:12:13.490 --> 03:12:16.192]  Thank you.
[03:12:16.192 --> 03:12:21.337]  The way that I see this is we elected Trump to get four years as president.
[03:12:21.337 --> 03:12:26.321]  We see the end of that race being when the deep state goes down.
[03:12:26.321 --> 03:12:31.045]  The Democrats see it as when Trump gets impeached.
[03:12:31.045 --> 03:12:34.849]  So the way that I'm thinking of this whole thing is that it's kind of a tortoise and a hare race.
[03:12:35.464 --> 03:12:42.266]  And that the Democrats are the hairs, they're bouncing all over the place from one news story to the next, no matter how false it is.
[03:12:42.266 --> 03:12:53.768]  While Trump slowly marches along, you start lining everything up, there's moves, there's counter moves, and I'm still pretty positive that there's going to be some stuff happening.
[03:12:53.768 --> 03:13:01.690]  One thing in particular which I'm not sure about, which I'd like to get your take on, is John Huber, Muthal.
[03:13:01.690 --> 03:13:04.351]  There was some stuff, I don't know if you saw the testimony yesterday,
[03:13:05.051 --> 03:13:09.594]  But, you know, there are some things in there that were pretty enlightening.
[03:13:09.594 --> 03:13:16.178]  But at the same time, there was something that was pretty scary that they said they had to give Huber's guys the information three times.
[03:13:16.178 --> 03:13:22.542]  Now, I don't know if that's government bureaucracy getting in the way, or if there's people even on Huber's team that are blocking things.
[03:13:22.542 --> 03:13:30.887]  But I'd like to get your take on his investigation, because we haven't really heard anything other than it exists, and they're looking at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:13:32.614 --> 03:13:39.377]  Yeah, there's been a few strings or parallel threads that we've been, you know, hoping on.
[03:13:39.377 --> 03:13:45.820]  One was that Jeff Sessions was just playing the quiet guy, but meanwhile he was secretly stacking everything up.
[03:13:45.820 --> 03:13:48.482]  That turned out to be a total fantasy.
[03:13:48.482 --> 03:13:50.843]  The guy was a nothing.
[03:13:50.843 --> 03:13:51.643]  And then there's the
[03:13:56.010 --> 03:13:56.551]  What do you call it?
[03:13:56.551 --> 03:13:57.793]  The Inspector General.
[03:13:57.793 --> 03:14:00.077]  Oh, the Inspector General is going to do it.
[03:14:00.077 --> 03:14:02.060]  The Inspector General has no subpoena powers.
[03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:07.229]  He has no powers, really, other than what the DOJ wants to give him.
[03:14:08.164 --> 03:14:09.965]  And I don't see anything coming from that.
[03:14:09.965 --> 03:14:12.006]  Then there's old Huber's out there.
[03:14:12.006 --> 03:14:17.808]  He's got his own pair of, you know, maybe there are secret grand juries going on.
[03:14:17.808 --> 03:14:21.270]  I saw a couple of the regulars along Hannity last night.
[03:14:21.270 --> 03:14:28.453]  They seemed pretty optimistic, you know, Solomon Carter, the usual bunch, but nothing ever seems to come of it.
[03:14:28.453 --> 03:14:31.695]  I think that one thing that Trump is doing that is strong, that's
[03:14:32.595 --> 03:14:37.816]  You know, really, a strong card to play is just the border.
[03:14:37.816 --> 03:14:44.097]  If Pelosi's going to go to shut down the government over no wall, I think that's a win for Trump.
[03:14:44.097 --> 03:14:45.598]  Just keep hammering that.
[03:14:45.598 --> 03:14:48.198]  I mean, gosh, where did Obama find $150 billion to give to Iran?
[03:14:48.198 --> 03:14:54.440]  They just pulled $150 billion out of the hat to give to Iran, and the Democrats won't give $5 billion for border security.
[03:15:02.276 --> 03:15:04.638]  And I'd be even more blunt than Trump.
[03:15:04.638 --> 03:15:07.841]  The Democrats want more illegal aliens.
[03:15:07.841 --> 03:15:14.166]  They want people coming into the country, you know, the dumber and the sicker and the better.
[03:15:14.166 --> 03:15:26.757]  Every person that sneaks into the country requires immediately federal government employees, that means the Democrats, you know, to support and assist them medically, with education, social services, everything.
[03:15:27.538 --> 03:15:34.500]  So, you know, I would keep beating on the drum of border security for as long as possible, as hard as possible.
[03:15:34.500 --> 03:15:38.241]  But as far as hoping for Huber, I don't see it.
[03:15:38.241 --> 03:15:45.862]  I've pretty much given up hope that there's some, like, it's like the Germans at the end of the war hoping for the super weapon, you know?
[03:15:45.862 --> 03:15:48.543]  Sooner or later, the super weapon is coming.
[03:15:48.543 --> 03:15:50.463]  It never came.
[03:15:50.463 --> 03:15:52.544]  Anyway, we'll be back after the break with more calls.
[03:15:53.522 --> 03:15:54.723]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.723 --> 03:16:00.107]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.107 --> 03:16:03.009]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.009 --> 03:16:06.591]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[03:16:06.591 --> 03:16:14.177]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[03:16:14.177 --> 03:16:18.780]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[03:16:18.780 --> 03:16:21.202]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[03:16:59.755 --> 03:17:02.576]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[03:17:06.339 --> 03:17:07.900]  NASA PAC Technology.

[03:17:12.683 --> 03:17:14.104]  Or warm and served.

[03:17:23.090 --> 03:17:24.331]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:24.331 --> 03:17:28.253]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:28.253 --> 03:17:29.794]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.794 --> 03:17:32.756]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.756 --> 03:17:38.300]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.300 --> 03:17:39.521]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.521 --> 03:17:42.443]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.443 --> 03:17:44.664]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.664 --> 03:17:49.107]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:49.107 --> 03:17:51.408]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:53.922 --> 03:18:00.332]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:18:00.332 --> 03:18:01.874]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:18:01.874 --> 03:18:06.781]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[03:18:06.781 --> 03:18:09.726]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[03:18:10.246 --> 03:18:12.989]  A free gift with every order.
[03:18:12.989 --> 03:18:21.856]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:18:21.856 --> 03:18:25.519]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:18:25.519 --> 03:18:30.884]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:18:30.884 --> 03:18:33.266]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:18:33.806 --> 03:18:38.667]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:18:38.667 --> 03:18:40.228]  So this is a loss leader.
[03:18:40.228 --> 03:18:41.788]  We are losing money on this.
[03:18:41.788 --> 03:18:43.209]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:18:43.209 --> 03:18:46.550]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.
[03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:51.551]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:18:51.551 --> 03:18:53.972]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[03:18:53.972 --> 03:19:02.334]  Infowars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[03:19:03.015 --> 03:19:04.356]  We've been proven dead on.
[03:19:04.356 --> 03:19:08.218]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[03:19:08.218 --> 03:19:12.861]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[03:19:12.861 --> 03:19:14.742]  Words are not enough.
[03:19:14.742 --> 03:19:20.925]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[03:19:20.925 --> 03:19:27.129]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[03:19:27.129 --> 03:19:30.471]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[03:19:31.104 --> 03:19:33.044]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[03:19:33.044 --> 03:19:37.466]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globally anti-human future.
[03:19:37.466 --> 03:19:43.307]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:19:43.307 --> 03:19:56.530]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[03:19:56.530 --> 03:19:59.191]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.592 --> 03:20:26.335]  Great bumper music, but I'm about as far from a surfing safari mood as it can be.
[03:20:26.335 --> 03:20:32.838]  It's a cold, dreary, rainy day here, and it seems pretty bleak.
[03:20:32.838 --> 03:20:33.338]  I know things.
[03:20:33.338 --> 03:20:33.978]  I'll cheer up.
[03:20:33.978 --> 03:20:34.459]  Don't worry.
[03:20:34.459 --> 03:20:36.199]  I won't give up.
[03:20:36.199 --> 03:20:39.501]  But at the moment, I'm not in a great mood.
[03:20:39.501 --> 03:20:45.664]  Let's see if Chris in Tennessee can throw some brightness onto the matter.
[03:20:45.664 --> 03:20:48.245]  Go ahead, Chris.
[03:20:48.245 --> 03:20:49.606]  Hey, Matt.
[03:20:49.606 --> 03:20:49.706]  Hey.
[03:20:50.582 --> 03:20:52.464]  I hope you're doing good.
[03:20:52.464 --> 03:21:01.172]  I know you're in bad spirits, but I hope you're still having time to have some fun and just relax despite everything that's going on.
[03:21:01.172 --> 03:21:02.333]  If it ever stops raining.
[03:21:02.333 --> 03:21:05.576]  Yeah, it's raining here too.
[03:21:05.576 --> 03:21:14.985]  I wanted to say this to Alex, but I love you too, so I'm gonna go ahead and just spit it all off if you'll be so kind as to give me
[03:21:15.826 --> 03:21:17.868]  20 seconds to spout off my first two points.
[03:21:17.868 --> 03:21:21.791]  I want to get to my third one, which I feel like is very, very important.
[03:21:21.791 --> 03:21:23.973]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:21:23.973 --> 03:21:28.777]  Number one, there's some great deals going on right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:21:28.777 --> 03:21:35.202]  I just bought about, I spent less than $100 on $250 worth of product.
[03:21:35.202 --> 03:21:37.444]  Got a free t-shirt with it too.
[03:21:37.444 --> 03:21:40.286]  So I urge all the listeners to go check that out.
[03:21:40.286 --> 03:21:40.726]  Number two,
[03:21:43.106 --> 03:21:50.549]  I had the pleasure of re-watching the movie Waking Life, the Richard Linklater movie.
[03:21:50.549 --> 03:21:57.171]  Holy moly, that is a great movie, and Alex Jones has a fantastic rant in that movie.
[03:21:57.171 --> 03:22:03.173]  I urge everybody to just go check that movie out, and a healthy dose of cannabis is not going to hurt the experience.
[03:22:03.173 --> 03:22:03.473]  It's great.
[03:22:10.685 --> 03:22:14.627]  Well, I mean, yeah, only if it's in a legal state.
[03:22:14.627 --> 03:22:17.288]  If it's in a legal state, do it.
[03:22:17.288 --> 03:22:36.275]  But, you know, my last point, and I do feel like this is super important, and I hope Alex and Gavin and Anthony Cumia or somebody needs to get this message to the Met, because when...
[03:22:38.471 --> 03:22:43.415]  Everybody I know under the age of 35 listens to the Joe Rogan Experience.
[03:22:43.415 --> 03:22:47.899]  He's basically bigger than Oprah, in my opinion.
[03:22:47.899 --> 03:22:49.500]  I think that's an arguable fact.
[03:22:49.500 --> 03:22:54.304]  Joe Rogan's podcast is bigger than Oprah ever was.
[03:22:54.304 --> 03:23:02.411]  I think that Alex and Owen Benjamin and Gavin and anybody else who's friends with Rogan
[03:23:03.812 --> 03:23:17.861]  Needs to really get on his butt about getting Alex on, getting Gavin back on, because I know so many people that listen to that podcast, and we're talking about a culture war, an information war.
[03:23:17.861 --> 03:23:23.905]  That's a big platform for Alex or Gavin or whoever to get their message across.
[03:23:23.905 --> 03:23:25.727]  And we have a real problem where
[03:23:28.706 --> 03:23:37.973]  Like Alex and you have been talking about, we seem to be kind of in an echo chamber right now, and that's a big platform for them to get their ideas across.
[03:23:37.973 --> 03:23:46.340]  And I know even, uh, I don't know if you heard it, but Anthony Cumia was just on Rogan, and you could tell Joe really looks up to Rogan.
[03:23:46.340 --> 03:23:50.083]  I mean, Joe really looks up to Anthony Cumia.
[03:23:50.083 --> 03:23:56.948]  And, uh, I think all those, all that group of guys really need to just start bugging Joe, just start hassling him like, hey,
[03:23:57.836 --> 03:24:00.818]  Like, you say you're our friend.
[03:24:00.818 --> 03:24:03.319]  You really need to, like, have us on.
[03:24:03.319 --> 03:24:04.199]  Especially Alex.
[03:24:04.199 --> 03:24:06.020]  Like, Alex needs to get back on Joe Rogan.
[03:24:06.020 --> 03:24:07.801]  I know he announced that podcast a while ago.
[03:24:07.801 --> 03:24:08.642]  He needs to get back.
[03:24:08.642 --> 03:24:19.288]  He needs to, like, really have Anthony Cumia and Owen Benjamin just get on Joe's butt and get back on there, because that's where we're going to win the culture war.
[03:24:19.288 --> 03:24:25.471]  All of these, you know, programming kind of decisions, that's, you know, I'm sure that's heard up the chain of command, but that's...
[03:24:26.061 --> 03:24:28.122]  You know, that's way over my pay grade.
[03:24:28.122 --> 03:24:34.364]  I really don't know about all the ins and outs of who's in with who and who's out with who.
[03:24:34.364 --> 03:24:37.985]  You know, I don't like the squabbling on our side.
[03:24:37.985 --> 03:24:43.967]  I know there's sometimes, you know, all kind of factors I'm not privy to.
[03:24:43.967 --> 03:24:50.770]  But in general, you know, if you have a choice between watching somebody's video or podcast
[03:24:51.437 --> 03:24:52.758]  Try to stay.
[03:24:52.758 --> 03:24:54.960]  It's difficult because it's so convenient.
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:25:05.948]  Of course, it's very convenient to use YouTube, but try to find other places, you know, like Brighteon, Bitshoot, Zoxy, things like that.
[03:25:05.948 --> 03:25:11.973]  Try to find and encourage podcasters, you know, not to just
[03:25:12.728 --> 03:25:15.489]  Make the easy way, which is YouTube.
[03:25:15.489 --> 03:25:19.490]  Encourage people to use alternative social media.
[03:25:19.490 --> 03:25:23.771]  It's the only way I think we're going to eventually make a dent, if it's even possible.
[03:25:23.771 --> 03:25:29.053]  But yeah, I haven't been listening to Joe Rogan lately.
[03:25:29.053 --> 03:25:32.854]  You know, I'm obviously not a millennial.
[03:25:32.854 --> 03:25:35.235]  But yeah, it's a good idea.
[03:25:35.235 --> 03:25:37.616]  I'll have to check it out.
[03:25:37.616 --> 03:25:39.256]  Thanks a lot.
[03:25:39.256 --> 03:25:42.297]  Hey, Justin in California, are you hanging on there?
[03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:45.451]  You're on the Culture War?
[03:25:45.451 --> 03:25:46.092]  Go ahead, Justin.
[03:25:46.092 --> 03:25:48.894]  Thank you for taking my call on that.
[03:25:48.894 --> 03:25:57.460]  Yeah, I was just echoing what you said earlier, you know, I think the Civil War's coming too, but I think one way that we can stop it is get more of a voice in pop culture, you know?
[03:25:57.460 --> 03:26:06.586]  It was really great to see, like, the last caller, he was bringing up the Joe Rogan Show, and I wanted to mention that as well, you know, it was really great to see Shooter Jennings
[03:26:07.114 --> 03:26:10.616]  On the Joe Rogan Show, really go to bat for Alex.
[03:26:10.616 --> 03:26:14.858]  I know Shooter, I went to a lot of his shows and I hung out with him a few times.
[03:26:14.858 --> 03:26:25.224]  Shooter's a really great guy and it was really great to see him really speaking out for Alex and saying we need to all back up the First Amendment.
[03:26:25.224 --> 03:26:29.787]  For him to go on that show and make that statement, it was really big.
[03:26:30.515 --> 03:26:40.041]  I think, you know, a lot more of Alex's audience should reach out and support people like Shooter Jennings, people that are coming to bat for our side, you know?
[03:26:40.041 --> 03:26:47.646]  I work for a certain government agency, sir, and I'm a CSR, there's a customer service representative.
[03:26:47.646 --> 03:26:54.370]  I take a lot of calls from a lot of college kids, and these kids are just really, really ignorant and have no clue what's going on.
[03:26:54.370 --> 03:26:55.691]  Zero life experience.
[03:26:56.044 --> 03:27:13.971]  I think if we really could get something in pop culture that could show that our side, you know, our side, our views and our opinions, and not make it look out to be stupid or racist or xenophobic or whatever words they want to put on, you know, when they attack, you know, the more conservative side.
[03:27:13.971 --> 03:27:21.114]  I think if we, you know, really support these voices that are going to bat for us and make them bigger stars, you know, that's going to help our side as well.
[03:27:23.430 --> 03:27:25.711]  Yeah, I don't know how that's accomplished.
[03:27:25.711 --> 03:27:28.673]  You know, I've been fighting this culture war for years.
[03:27:28.673 --> 03:27:33.875]  My first novel, you know, is 15 years old.
[03:27:33.875 --> 03:27:37.877]  People for years have been saying, they should be made into movies.
[03:27:37.877 --> 03:27:38.837]  My books, you know.
[03:27:38.837 --> 03:27:42.859]  This is my own fighting in the culture war.
[03:27:42.859 --> 03:27:46.321]  But it's hard to get traction when everything is lined up towards the left.
[03:27:47.197 --> 03:27:52.300]  Uh, anything that starts to get traction, you know, you get kicked off of Twitter.
[03:27:52.300 --> 03:27:54.622]  But, um, I mean, we keep fighting.
[03:27:54.622 --> 03:27:57.884]  I wish that, uh, I wish there were movie producers out there.
[03:27:57.884 --> 03:27:59.585]  There have been a few in the past.
[03:27:59.585 --> 03:28:01.846]  There are great movies that could be made.
[03:28:01.846 --> 03:28:07.009]  Uh, television shows too, but I don't see, um, I don't see the funding for it.
[03:28:07.009 --> 03:28:10.992]  Everybody talks about these things, but the money never comes through.
[03:28:10.992 --> 03:28:11.512]  So, um,
[03:28:12.398 --> 03:28:18.046]  You know, I think that alternative social media, it's the only place we've got.
[03:28:18.046 --> 03:28:20.829]  You know, you can make videos that won't be banned.
[03:28:20.829 --> 03:28:25.656]  And what they said, YouTube has taken off like 50 million videos in the last year.
[03:28:26.423 --> 03:28:29.084]  They just put the thumb down and you're gone.
[03:28:29.084 --> 03:28:34.526]  So how can you reach a mass culture audience when your videos are taken down?
[03:28:34.526 --> 03:28:42.810]  And then you have to self-censor to keep it so that they'll not just kick it off of YouTube.
[03:28:42.810 --> 03:28:50.453]  Mark Dice can't even say the word that got Morning Joe in trouble.
[03:28:50.453 --> 03:28:51.934]  He's afraid to say that word.
[03:28:51.934 --> 03:28:52.374]  It's ridiculous.
[03:28:52.955 --> 03:28:56.496]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.496 --> 03:29:00.077]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.077 --> 03:29:02.198]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[03:29:02.198 --> 03:29:04.218]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?

[03:29:54.705 --> 03:30:00.711]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[03:30:00.711 --> 03:30:01.612]  So I'll say it short and sweet.
[03:30:02.475 --> 03:30:04.799]  We need your support now more than ever.
[03:30:04.799 --> 03:30:07.664]  You've come through a thousand times so I'm not bitching at you.
[03:30:07.664 --> 03:30:10.649]  I'm just simply telling you we are in the thick of the battle now.
[03:30:10.649 --> 03:30:16.319]  The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential and down the road we probably will get destroyed.
[03:30:17.122 --> 03:30:29.548]  But I know, and God has really put it on my heart, that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[03:30:29.548 --> 03:30:31.469]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[03:30:31.469 --> 03:30:32.850]  I need to be provisioned.
[03:30:32.850 --> 03:30:37.172]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[03:30:37.172 --> 03:30:38.033]  But I need your prayers.
[03:30:38.033 --> 03:30:39.933]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[03:30:39.933 --> 03:30:41.894]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[03:30:41.894 --> 03:30:42.635]  We make it easy.
[03:30:43.195 --> 03:30:51.577]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals.
[03:30:51.577 --> 03:30:53.157]  Please consider a contribution.
[03:31:07.281 --> 03:31:22.831]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[03:31:23.979 --> 03:31:27.822]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[03:32:57.374 --> 03:33:00.035]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.613 --> 03:33:20.414]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:20.414 --> 03:33:27.076]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:27.076 --> 03:33:34.037]  Okay, I'm looking at the board and I see a lot of patient people on hold.
[03:33:34.037 --> 03:33:39.538]  Let's go to Clinton, Texas, who also has an idea about the upcoming Civil War.
[03:33:39.538 --> 03:33:40.178]  Clint, are you there?
[03:33:41.107 --> 03:33:42.027]  Yes, sir, I am.
[03:33:42.027 --> 03:33:49.831]  First of all, I just wanted to say thank you and everybody for all you're all trying to do.
[03:33:49.831 --> 03:33:52.572]  It's hard.
[03:33:52.572 --> 03:33:57.454]  You know, actually, I was listening to you while I was working and I stopped what I was doing.
[03:33:57.454 --> 03:34:02.816]  You know, I think you're absolutely right.
[03:34:02.816 --> 03:34:05.698]  There's going to be no way out of the Civil War.
[03:34:07.754 --> 03:34:09.355]  It's just inevitable.
[03:34:09.355 --> 03:34:18.419]  Um, I like to be optimistic, but you know how the funniest things like to go on during the holidays and people don't pay attention?
[03:34:18.419 --> 03:34:33.587]  That's, I'm, I don't know, something about this Christmas holidays as, you know, how you have that gut feeling, that gut instinct that just, you know, gets at you.
[03:34:33.587 --> 03:34:37.169]  Well, you know, I think honestly they're going to,
[03:34:38.277 --> 03:34:43.678]  You know, either one, crash the stock market either right during the holidays or right after.
[03:34:43.678 --> 03:34:51.060]  Number two, during that time, I feel that something's going to happen to our president.
[03:34:51.060 --> 03:34:56.261]  And number three, it'll ultimately just lead to a civil war scenario.
[03:34:56.261 --> 03:34:59.462]  That's just kind of how it all seems to be playing out.
[03:34:59.462 --> 03:35:00.863]  I could be totally wrong.
[03:35:00.863 --> 03:35:02.563]  What are your thoughts?
[03:35:02.563 --> 03:35:06.384]  Yeah, I think that the deep state plotters
[03:35:07.133 --> 03:35:12.234]  You know, Brennan, Clapper, Mueller, and all of their minions and lackeys.
[03:35:12.234 --> 03:35:15.635]  I think that they're amazed that Trump is still standing.
[03:35:15.635 --> 03:35:29.118]  You know, the guy's got skin thicker than a rhinoceros and they're shooting at him and they thought he would be down long ago and he's still standing strong.
[03:35:29.118 --> 03:35:36.600]  So I think that there will be some people out there that will just say, look, the only way we're going to get rid of this guy is to get rid of him.
[03:35:37.672 --> 03:35:41.474]  And, you know, maybe it'll be some kind of a plausible accident.
[03:35:41.474 --> 03:35:46.457]  I always worry about airplanes and helicopters, things like that.
[03:35:46.457 --> 03:35:47.638]  Or maybe it won't.
[03:35:47.638 --> 03:35:54.161]  But I'll guarantee you some of these deep state people, they're very panicked.
[03:35:54.161 --> 03:35:55.522]  And it's not just Democrats.
[03:35:55.522 --> 03:36:01.585]  You know, Trump being such an outsider, he threatens to expose a lot of corruption.
[03:36:01.585 --> 03:36:04.767]  And the corruption is not only among the Democrats.
[03:36:04.767 --> 03:36:06.768]  So there are entrenched forces.
[03:36:07.386 --> 03:36:11.649]  That have been on all kind of corrupt gravy trains for decades.
[03:36:11.649 --> 03:36:17.914]  And Trump is really a danger to that status quo, and they would like to see him get, you know, gone.
[03:36:17.914 --> 03:36:21.237]  As far as the stock market, of course, it's inevitable.
[03:36:21.237 --> 03:36:28.682]  But are there people, you know, George Soros, etc., who would, who would, if they could, swing the market to cause it to crash?
[03:36:28.682 --> 03:36:29.263]  No doubt.
[03:36:29.263 --> 03:36:35.327]  And if and when this happens, and it's a recession's inevitable, when it happens, they're going to blame Trump 100%.
[03:36:36.770 --> 03:36:46.196]  So just as the while the economy's been strong and unemployment numbers and so forth have been strong, the media doesn't say a word to give him credit.
[03:36:46.196 --> 03:36:51.479]  But if the economy crashes, you can bet he's going to get 100% of the blame.
[03:36:51.479 --> 03:36:55.462]  And you can see that there are there are still things happening.
[03:36:55.462 --> 03:36:59.945]  Like this, this Chinese businesswoman that was arrested in Canada.
[03:36:59.945 --> 03:37:01.526]  This, the arrest was made
[03:37:02.276 --> 03:37:17.179]  I think while Trump was actually speaking to her meeting with the Chinese, and I don't think he knew about it, I think this is a complete, this is a shot at Trump showing that, you know, the deep state can still meddle in international affairs.
[03:37:17.179 --> 03:37:27.741]  This is a very huge woman in China that was arrested basically while changing flights, changing planes in Canada, and she was grabbed.
[03:37:28.393 --> 03:37:39.495]  You know, imagine, you know, like a Steve Jobs, somebody, you know, a boss ahead of Facebook or Google being arrested, changing planes in Hong Kong.
[03:37:39.495 --> 03:37:42.696]  And then, you know, this is a huge news in China.
[03:37:42.696 --> 03:37:44.156]  It's not in America.
[03:37:44.156 --> 03:37:49.057]  But, you know, the deep state is actively meddling and trying to take out Trump.
[03:37:49.057 --> 03:37:55.279]  And I think that it's going to continue and get worse, especially if there's any kind of a market crash.
[03:37:55.279 --> 03:37:56.359]  He's going to be blamed 100 percent.
[03:37:57.614 --> 03:37:58.354]  Yeah.
[03:37:58.354 --> 03:37:59.415]  Debbie.
[03:37:59.415 --> 03:38:00.756]  Yeah.
[03:38:00.756 --> 03:38:02.236]  Thanks, Clint.
[03:38:02.236 --> 03:38:05.558]  Debbie in New Jersey, been waiting a long time.
[03:38:05.558 --> 03:38:06.218]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[03:38:06.218 --> 03:38:07.459]  What did you want to say?
[03:38:07.459 --> 03:38:11.561]  First, I want to say Merry Christmas to all you guys and especially you, Matt.
[03:38:11.561 --> 03:38:12.081]  Thanks.
[03:38:12.081 --> 03:38:12.842]  Please cheer up.
[03:38:12.842 --> 03:38:16.584]  I want you to know I was married to an outlaw biker.
[03:38:16.584 --> 03:38:18.465]  It would help if the sling came out.
[03:38:18.465 --> 03:38:18.985]  Go ahead.
[03:38:18.985 --> 03:38:20.366]  Don't worry, it will.
[03:38:20.366 --> 03:38:20.986]  It will.
[03:38:20.986 --> 03:38:24.348]  Okay.
[03:38:24.348 --> 03:38:26.549]  If the deep state does not think
[03:38:27.509 --> 03:38:37.217]  That the outlaw bikers, hell's angels in this country, I was married to one, is gonna stand by and let these sons of bitches take this country over?
[03:38:37.217 --> 03:38:40.099]  They are sadly mistaken.
[03:38:40.099 --> 03:38:41.500]  I have first-hand knowledge.
[03:38:41.500 --> 03:38:45.323]  I know for a fact these guys are gonna step up to the plate.
[03:38:45.323 --> 03:38:53.430]  Not only that, I have a summer home in Hebron, Maryland, where the biggest militia is.
[03:38:53.430 --> 03:38:54.891]  And I have plenty of friends down there.
[03:38:56.212 --> 03:39:03.055]  People are going to stand up, people are ready, and they are silently waiting.
[03:39:03.055 --> 03:39:10.238]  Everybody should know, have faith, prepare yourself, don't be afraid.
[03:39:10.238 --> 03:39:11.978]  We're here in New Jersey and we're not afraid.
[03:39:11.978 --> 03:39:16.580]  They come to this door, well they'll have to take us out in a body bag if we lose.
[03:39:16.580 --> 03:39:18.941]  But I do not plan on going to prison, I'll tell you that.
[03:39:21.271 --> 03:39:38.165]  Well, I appreciate that spirit, but I think most people, as long as there's electricity, food in the refrigerator, their smartphone is charged up and has all the latest apps, I don't think they really care what happens politically.
[03:39:38.165 --> 03:39:40.106]  It's hard to motivate people.
[03:39:40.106 --> 03:39:48.093]  Concepts like freedom of speech, what does that matter to people that are just watching viral videos all day, playing video games?
[03:39:48.815 --> 03:39:57.899]  You know, as long as the power is on and they're not hungry, I think that they'll accept almost anything politically.
[03:39:57.899 --> 03:40:11.265]  But what comes after a civil war is almost surely going to be some form of economic collapse, you know, cut off of, you know, imagine just if the truckers went on a strike, for example.
[03:40:11.954 --> 03:40:19.841]  Or imagine if something happened that food and diesel fuel weren't being distributed because it was too dangerous to drive down the highway.
[03:40:19.841 --> 03:40:25.406]  You know, in a modern civil war, the infrastructure is just too vulnerable.
[03:40:25.406 --> 03:40:33.073]  Any aggrieved party, any small splinter group can pretty much shut down the freeways, you know, without being too graphic.
[03:40:33.073 --> 03:40:36.836]  It's not rocket science to imagine how this can happen.
[03:40:37.483 --> 03:40:39.104]  But then everybody suffers.
[03:40:39.104 --> 03:40:45.950]  Once everybody is suffering, the media will then portray, you know, the patriotic side as terrorists.
[03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:47.811]  It's, you know, predictable.
[03:40:47.811 --> 03:40:50.933]  And, you know, then I guess we'll be in it.
[03:40:50.933 --> 03:40:52.495]  We'll just have to see what happens then.
[03:40:52.495 --> 03:40:55.397]  But I don't want to see anybody carried out in body bags.
[03:40:55.397 --> 03:41:02.302]  I wish we could raise awareness about our, you know, our steadily diminishing freedoms short of that.
[03:41:02.302 --> 03:41:04.464]  But, you know, we'll just have to see.
[03:41:06.368 --> 03:41:09.270]  Al in Texas, a war vet.
[03:41:09.270 --> 03:41:13.193]  Go ahead, Al.
[03:41:13.193 --> 03:41:22.379]  I want to talk specifically to the people who are getting very frustrated and saying that we have to, or that we will, move to a revolution.
[03:41:22.379 --> 03:41:27.682]  You know, when you're old enough to remember World War II, it gives you a perspective.
[03:41:27.682 --> 03:41:33.526]  I have personally witnessed every political revolution of the 20th century, not including the Bolshevik Revolution.
[03:41:34.525 --> 03:41:36.766]  They are notoriously counterproductive.
[03:41:36.766 --> 03:41:42.047]  You always end up with something far worse than you overthrew.
[03:41:42.047 --> 03:41:44.648]  And I'm looking at where we stand.
[03:41:44.648 --> 03:41:46.969]  We've got a couple years left with Trump.
[03:41:46.969 --> 03:41:51.670]  He seems to me to be remarkably incompetent.
[03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:52.551]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:41:52.551 --> 03:41:57.852]  He's going to be gone by nothing other than the operation of term limits.
[03:41:57.852 --> 03:41:59.133]  He's going to be gone.
[03:41:59.133 --> 03:42:00.193]  And what have we got?
[03:42:00.193 --> 03:42:03.054]  We've got a bunch of old people like me who don't matter because we're dying.
[03:42:04.008 --> 03:42:11.812]  The only people who matter are the young people, and half of the young people do not want the United States to continue.
[03:42:11.812 --> 03:42:24.759]  Do these revolutionaries, these self-appointed pro-revolutionaries, seriously expect me to violently attack my children, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren?
[03:42:24.759 --> 03:42:25.420]  No, I can't see it.
[03:42:25.420 --> 03:42:29.102]  Because if you are mistaken, I will not do it.
[03:42:29.102 --> 03:42:30.222]  Yeah, okay.
[03:42:30.222 --> 03:42:31.023]  Thanks, Al.
[03:42:31.023 --> 03:42:33.104]  That's a long term of history.
[03:42:33.883 --> 03:42:36.046]  Yeah, nobody's going to win in a civil war.
[03:42:36.046 --> 03:42:39.151]  And like you said, it usually winds up worse, you know.
[03:42:39.151 --> 03:42:43.376]  The French Revolution went from guillotines to Napoleon.
[03:42:43.376 --> 03:42:47.482]  And that seems to be a historical pattern.
[03:42:47.482 --> 03:42:49.185]  Anyway, we'll see you on the other side of the break.
[03:42:52.697 --> 03:42:59.079]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:42:59.079 --> 03:43:00.640]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:43:00.640 --> 03:43:05.542]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[03:43:05.542 --> 03:43:08.463]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[03:43:09.023 --> 03:43:11.765]  A free gift with every order.
[03:43:11.765 --> 03:43:20.610]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine 4 to 5, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:43:20.610 --> 03:43:24.292]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:43:24.292 --> 03:43:29.655]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:43:29.655 --> 03:43:32.037]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:43:32.577 --> 03:43:37.442]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:43:37.442 --> 03:43:38.983]  So this is a loss leader.
[03:43:38.983 --> 03:43:40.565]  We are losing money on this.
[03:43:40.565 --> 03:43:41.986]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:43:41.986 --> 03:43:43.988]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:43:43.988 --> 03:43:45.330]  And don't fight the crowds.
[03:43:45.330 --> 03:43:46.751]  InfoWorksStore.com, InfoWorksLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:43:46.751 --> 03:43:48.273]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[03:43:52.797 --> 03:43:56.920]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:56.920 --> 03:44:03.986]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:44:03.986 --> 03:44:08.809]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:44:08.809 --> 03:44:15.695]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced four-stage compact filtration system
[03:44:16.115 --> 03:44:22.138]  that will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:44:22.138 --> 03:44:31.702]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:44:31.702 --> 03:44:38.805]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:44:39.105 --> 03:44:44.707]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[03:45:02.794 --> 03:45:04.135]  We've been proven dead on.
[03:45:04.135 --> 03:45:07.997]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[03:45:07.997 --> 03:45:12.640]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[03:45:12.640 --> 03:45:14.522]  Words are not enough.
[03:45:14.522 --> 03:45:20.706]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[03:45:20.706 --> 03:45:26.910]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[03:45:26.910 --> 03:45:30.252]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[03:45:30.882 --> 03:45:32.803]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[03:45:32.803 --> 03:45:37.325]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globally anti-human future.
[03:45:37.325 --> 03:45:43.067]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:45:43.067 --> 03:45:44.307]  I am in your hands.
[03:45:44.307 --> 03:45:52.371]  And we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[03:45:54.338 --> 03:45:58.800]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[03:45:58.800 --> 03:46:03.342]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[03:46:03.342 --> 03:46:13.846]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:13.846 --> 03:46:17.708]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[03:46:17.708 --> 03:46:19.229]  All the sales the last 12 days
[03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:22.452]  50 to 75% off is back.
[03:46:22.452 --> 03:46:23.533]  Free shipping is still there.
[03:46:23.533 --> 03:46:24.934]  Double Patriot points.
[03:46:24.934 --> 03:46:28.157]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[03:46:28.157 --> 03:46:32.702]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[03:46:32.702 --> 03:46:34.163]  Just go check out the sales.
[03:46:34.163 --> 03:46:35.485]  There's too many to break them all down.
[03:46:35.485 --> 03:46:39.288]  Get your orders in by the 19th so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[03:46:40.029 --> 03:46:42.030]  And thank you again all for your support.
[03:46:42.030 --> 03:46:46.493]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[03:46:46.493 --> 03:46:51.155]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the Globals together.
[03:46:51.155 --> 03:46:56.778]  Thank you.
[03:46:56.778 --> 03:46:59.439]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.655 --> 03:47:22.238]  The great Ennio Morricone.
[03:47:22.238 --> 03:47:23.799]  What a genius.
[03:47:23.799 --> 03:47:30.704]  Anyway, I'm going to take the remaining calls in this last segment, and they're going to have to be short so I can get to everybody.
[03:47:30.704 --> 03:47:38.950]  And what I'll do is just let you make a comment, speak for a minute or two, and then we'll go to the next call.
[03:47:38.950 --> 03:47:40.972]  I see a Dr. Kelly in California.
[03:47:41.920 --> 03:47:43.941]  Are you there still, Dr. Kelly?
[03:47:43.941 --> 03:47:46.843]  Thank you so much for taking my call and I will make it quick.
[03:47:46.843 --> 03:48:00.673]  I'd like to point out that the people that are senators such as Feinstein, Harris, and several of the politicians are sitting bar attorneys in their respective states.
[03:48:00.673 --> 03:48:04.035]  I'd like people to look into that and to expose that.
[03:48:04.956 --> 03:48:11.077]  And we've got Will Wagner, who exposed the original 13th Amendment from 1811.
[03:48:11.077 --> 03:48:17.598]  And there are so many wonderful works to read in your local law library.
[03:48:17.598 --> 03:48:24.119]  And document it, teach your kids, and thank you, Matt, for your work.
[03:48:24.119 --> 03:48:25.080]  Thank you.
[03:48:25.080 --> 03:48:29.540]  That whole vote harvesting thing out in Orange County, that's really got me freaked out.
[03:48:29.540 --> 03:48:31.181]  That's so Venezuela.
[03:48:31.181 --> 03:48:33.301]  It's just almost beyond belief.
[03:48:34.428 --> 03:48:40.390]  Next, it's going to be, you know, people's cadres collecting the votes and filling them out for you.
[03:48:40.390 --> 03:48:44.010]  Matt in Ohio wants to talk about the coming crash.
[03:48:44.010 --> 03:48:44.651]  Matt, are you there?
[03:48:44.651 --> 03:48:48.131]  Hey, how's it going, Matt?
[03:48:48.131 --> 03:48:48.391]  Great.
[03:48:48.391 --> 03:48:49.052]  Thanks for holding.
[03:48:49.052 --> 03:48:51.052]  Oh, no problem.
[03:48:51.052 --> 03:48:53.073]  I just wanted to make a quick comment.
[03:48:53.073 --> 03:48:54.913]  I want to talk about the economic crash.
[03:48:54.913 --> 03:48:56.934]  Did you see the Economist 2019 issue?
[03:48:56.934 --> 03:48:57.294]  No.
[03:48:57.294 --> 03:48:57.874]  I'll look for it.
[03:48:57.874 --> 03:48:59.754]  Go ahead.
[03:49:03.624 --> 03:49:10.246]  Yeah, it shows a picture with Trump's face on there and then it shows like a graph over him, you know, like they're hitting at a economic crash.
[03:49:10.246 --> 03:49:13.728]  And then it also shows like, you know, a picture of a panda bear representing China.
[03:49:13.728 --> 03:49:16.309]  And it shows, you know, a thing about Brexit.
[03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:20.610]  It shows the thing about Putin and the Four Horsemen and all kinds of stuff.
[03:49:20.610 --> 03:49:28.833]  It even shows stuff about, you know, the transhumanism movement, where it's a stork holding, you know, a bag with a barcode over it.
[03:49:29.298 --> 03:49:34.860]  So, you know, they are really planning something this upcoming year, you know, it's going to get pretty crazy.
[03:49:34.860 --> 03:49:38.181]  And they even have the marijuana, a guy holding the marijuana thing.
[03:49:38.181 --> 03:49:43.182]  So I believe that they're going to start even injecting stuff in this marijuana that they're making illegal.
[03:49:43.182 --> 03:49:46.683]  You know, it's dumbed down the culture even more than what it already is.
[03:49:46.683 --> 03:49:50.344]  You know, it's crazy times we're in, but, you know, we just got to trust in God.
[03:49:50.344 --> 03:49:52.565]  And, you know, I just wanted to make that quick comment.
[03:49:53.874 --> 03:49:59.377]  Yeah, legalization almost seems like Brave New World's SOMA.
[03:49:59.377 --> 03:50:07.142]  You know, just keep the population stoned and happy, feed them on virtual reality, you know, video games, etc.
[03:50:08.183 --> 03:50:14.068]  Now we're seeing kids have their brains rewired, you know, with the smartphones.
[03:50:14.068 --> 03:50:22.234]  They're literally becoming stupid because they're hooked into an information machine from toddler age.
[03:50:22.234 --> 03:50:28.599]  Instead of their brain learning to be inquisitive about the world, the brain is just fed messages.
[03:50:28.599 --> 03:50:36.726]  And they look at children's brains now and they're being ruined from a young age, making them into perfect slaves, I would think.
[03:50:37.913 --> 03:50:41.562]  Let's see, who do we have up here for a while?
[03:50:41.562 --> 03:50:44.169]  James in California.
[03:50:44.169 --> 03:50:44.831]  Go ahead, James.
[03:50:46.380 --> 03:50:46.860]  How's it going?
[03:50:46.860 --> 03:50:48.200]  I'm going to keep it real short.
[03:50:48.200 --> 03:50:50.761]  I'm on the front lines here of California.
[03:50:50.761 --> 03:50:54.162]  I'm a 29-year-old in Sacramento, Citrus Heights area.
[03:50:54.162 --> 03:50:56.842]  My name's Jimmy Bazalion.
[03:50:56.842 --> 03:50:59.483]  Let's take it back to 1776.
[03:50:59.483 --> 03:51:04.864]  Our fathers, our founding fathers, our men and women fought like the savage Indians.
[03:51:04.864 --> 03:51:06.505]  Like to call it guerrilla warfare.
[03:51:06.505 --> 03:51:11.246]  As the Redcoats said, lined up, we just did a headshot after headshot.
[03:51:11.246 --> 03:51:12.826]  And I don't, I want to keep this peaceful.
[03:51:13.712 --> 03:51:17.175]  I think it's important that we do guerrilla advertising.
[03:51:17.175 --> 03:51:24.520]  I'm sure every person listening to this right now has a fence board or some sort of piece of wood and some paint laying around the house.
[03:51:24.520 --> 03:51:36.348]  It's as simple as taking a drill and some screws, painting your rights onto a board, and getting your information out that way, because we all know we're being censored on Google and Facebook.
[03:51:36.348 --> 03:51:38.309]  That will in turn go viral.
[03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:40.531]  You know mainstream media will love to cover this.
[03:51:41.960 --> 03:51:44.521]  We're all Alex Jones.
[03:51:44.521 --> 03:51:46.701]  An injury to one of us is an injury to all of us.
[03:51:46.701 --> 03:51:50.863]  Keep your chin in, your chest out, and be proud to be an American.
[03:51:50.863 --> 03:52:01.726]  Yeah, I think guerrilla marketing of ideas can be very effective, like the it's okay to be white messages totally freak out the leftists.
[03:52:01.726 --> 03:52:04.787]  Simple things like that.
[03:52:04.787 --> 03:52:06.547]  Let me see.
[03:52:06.547 --> 03:52:08.708]  We've got Liberty Smith.
[03:52:09.813 --> 03:52:12.515]  In Oklahoma, Liberty Smith.
[03:52:12.515 --> 03:52:13.456]  Cool name.
[03:52:13.456 --> 03:52:15.017]  Go ahead, Smith.
[03:52:15.017 --> 03:52:15.918]  Hey, Matt.
[03:52:15.918 --> 03:52:18.180]  How are you today?
[03:52:18.180 --> 03:52:19.401]  Great, thanks.
[03:52:19.401 --> 03:52:24.525]  You haven't been real encouraging today, but that's okay because I understand.
[03:52:24.525 --> 03:52:27.027]  Trust me on this one.
[03:52:27.027 --> 03:52:36.415]  Yeah, I have several thoughts, but the biggest one for me is I live in a rural area in rural Oklahoma.
[03:52:36.415 --> 03:52:37.335]  I work in a 50,000
[03:52:39.918 --> 03:52:40.178]  Yeah.
[03:53:10.140 --> 03:53:11.981]  Do more than what I'm already doing.
[03:53:11.981 --> 03:53:14.303]  And, you know, I call the White House.
[03:53:14.303 --> 03:53:18.466]  I email the president and congressmen and everything else.
[03:53:18.466 --> 03:53:24.390]  And I do it about once a week or twice a month or whatever.
[03:53:24.390 --> 03:53:25.610]  And I want to do more.
[03:53:25.610 --> 03:53:26.911]  I am restless.
[03:53:26.911 --> 03:53:29.273]  I am sick of this crap.
[03:53:29.273 --> 03:53:33.796]  And I think, you know, the audience, the info warriors are too.
[03:53:34.540 --> 03:53:45.005]  So my question is, rural America, older, loves our country, loves my children and grandchildren, what else can I do?
[03:53:45.005 --> 03:53:48.867]  I don't know, but when you drive around, your vehicle's going to be seen.
[03:53:48.867 --> 03:53:52.128]  I like the idea of these magnetic InfoWare stickers.
[03:53:52.128 --> 03:53:56.670]  You can also get full-sized sheets of, it's like the refrigerator magnet material.
[03:53:56.670 --> 03:54:00.752]  Then you can stick a Trump bumper sticker or any other bumper sticker on it.
[03:54:01.303 --> 03:54:05.864]  But you're not committed to it if you're afraid your car is going to get keyed in certain areas.
[03:54:05.864 --> 03:54:12.566]  When you're just driving around in normal life, you can put any message you want on your vehicle and take it off when you want.
[03:54:12.566 --> 03:54:16.707]  I'm the same age, and it's pretty discouraging.
[03:54:16.707 --> 03:54:19.588]  It almost feels like we have no voice.
[03:54:19.588 --> 03:54:25.490]  Eventually, it might come to some kind of a yellow vest movement in America with taking to the streets.
[03:54:26.403 --> 03:54:34.629]  You know, in the USA, mostly it's urban versus rural, and eventually, if it comes to a civil war, you know, they don't grow food in the cities.
[03:54:34.629 --> 03:54:38.632]  It's just something to keep in mind.
[03:54:38.632 --> 03:54:39.753]  Maybe last call.
[03:54:39.753 --> 03:54:42.675]  Gary in Texas says, when is it time?
[03:54:42.675 --> 03:54:45.357]  Gary in Texas, go ahead.
[03:54:45.357 --> 03:54:46.318]  Yes, sir.
[03:54:46.318 --> 03:54:48.119]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:54:48.119 --> 03:54:51.882]  My question is, when do you know it's time?
[03:54:51.882 --> 03:54:53.023]  When do you know it's time?
[03:54:55.188 --> 03:55:19.296]  Well, I think that as long as we're able to have this show, for example, while we're still broadcasting, even on maybe you could say reduced volume since InfoWars has been largely banned from mainstream broadcasting on YouTube and so forth, when you see voices like Alex Jones and my own and others
[03:55:20.243 --> 03:55:24.965]  Going silent, that will be a big clue that the time is getting close.
[03:55:24.965 --> 03:55:33.950]  But really, there won't be any kind of revolution in this country as long as food supply is going, electricity is flowing.
[03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:36.111]  It's not going to happen just for political reasons.
[03:55:36.867 --> 03:55:42.911]  It won't happen until there's a real pinch, you know, an economic collapse, food distribution breaks down.
[03:55:42.911 --> 03:55:45.813]  When that happens, all hell is gonna break loose.
[03:55:45.813 --> 03:55:51.356]  And unfortunately, I think that that's inevitable at some point, especially with the Democrats
[03:55:52.669 --> 03:55:54.550]  Basically, they're globalists.
[03:55:54.550 --> 03:56:05.874]  They want to change America fundamentally, as Obama put it, make it just another third world country, because Democrats actually love ruling third world countries.
[03:56:05.874 --> 03:56:09.556]  Look at Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia.
[03:56:09.556 --> 03:56:16.279]  Any of the cities that the Democrats have ruled for generations are a microcosm of a third world country.
[03:56:16.279 --> 03:56:19.600]  And they don't care if the people are hungry, if crime is out of control.
[03:56:20.558 --> 03:56:21.759]  Look at Maxine Waters.
[03:56:21.759 --> 03:56:24.300]  She lived in a $4 million mansion.
[03:56:24.300 --> 03:56:27.361]  Her district is mostly very poor people.
[03:56:27.361 --> 03:56:29.663]  She lives out of the district in the mansion.
[03:56:29.663 --> 03:56:33.845]  So the Democrats don't care if the country is ruined, as long as they're ruling it.
[03:56:33.845 --> 03:56:36.326]  They don't mind ruling the ruins.
[03:56:36.326 --> 03:56:46.651]  So I don't think there's going to be anything like a real civil war until all of this eventually collapses in a heap and the country has an economy like Venezuela.
[03:56:46.651 --> 03:56:48.212]  That's when it's going to, that's when the
[03:56:49.255 --> 03:56:52.876]  That's when the S is going to hit the fan, for sure.
[03:56:52.876 --> 03:57:01.520]  But as long as people have their smartphones, TVs, video games, refrigerators full, then there's not going to be anything happening.
[03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:10.023]  We're just going to be grinding our teeth and wailing to each other here on the Internet and social media.
[03:57:10.023 --> 03:57:17.806]  But eventually, where it happens is when the refrigerator is empty and there are no more food trucks coming.
[03:57:19.053 --> 03:57:21.314]  That's gonna be the final sign.
[03:57:21.314 --> 03:57:32.359]  Well, it's been fun taking calls this last hour of the week on InfoWars, and I'll see you next week or sometime in the future, and maybe then I'll be more cheerful.
[03:57:32.359 --> 03:57:37.682]  But Merry Christmas to the InfoWars Army, and keep fighting.
[03:57:37.682 --> 03:57:38.622]  Never give up.
[03:57:38.622 --> 03:57:39.323]  Never surrender.
[03:57:44.249 --> 03:57:49.934]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:57:49.934 --> 03:57:53.077]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:57:53.077 --> 03:57:55.740]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:57:55.740 --> 03:58:00.044]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:58:00.044 --> 03:58:07.531]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:58:07.531 --> 03:58:09.953]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[03:58:13.388 --> 03:58:15.590]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:16.570]  They called it U.N.
[03:58:16.570 --> 03:58:18.332]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[03:58:18.332 --> 03:58:19.032]  2030 Agenda.
[03:58:19.032 --> 03:58:30.540]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:58:30.540 --> 03:58:32.122]  It's the David Knight Show!
[03:58:32.122 --> 03:58:35.824]  Never miss your show, any day.
[03:58:35.824 --> 03:58:36.345]  I mean, what?
[03:58:36.345 --> 03:58:37.005]  I mean, never!
[03:58:43.795 --> 03:58:45.136]  Everybody knows it.
[03:58:45.136 --> 03:58:47.037]  History documents it.
[03:58:47.037 --> 03:58:52.620]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[03:58:52.620 --> 03:58:53.741]  They want to abort children.
[03:58:53.741 --> 03:58:55.502]  They want to disease children.
[03:58:55.502 --> 03:58:56.622]  They want to abuse children.
[03:58:56.622 --> 03:58:58.243]  They want to confuse children.
[03:58:58.243 --> 03:58:59.424]  They want their essence.
[03:58:59.424 --> 03:59:00.365]  They want their soul.
[03:59:00.365 --> 03:59:01.705]  They want their spirit.
[03:59:01.705 --> 03:59:03.466]  They want their power.
[03:59:03.466 --> 03:59:04.447]  Because they are our future.
[03:59:05.675 --> 03:59:09.378]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[03:59:09.378 --> 03:59:11.180]  It is about the West.
[03:59:11.180 --> 03:59:15.323]  And it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[03:59:15.323 --> 03:59:18.146]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[03:59:18.146 --> 03:59:24.811]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for Infowars.
[03:59:24.811 --> 03:59:28.635]  And remember that you have the power to change the world.
[03:59:28.635 --> 03:59:30.716]  You have the power to override the censors.
[03:59:30.716 --> 03:59:33.699]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[03:59:34.464 --> 03:59:46.691]  I know you've been taking action, I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[03:59:46.691 --> 03:59:49.313]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
