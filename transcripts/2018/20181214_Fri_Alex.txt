[00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:06.850]  Alex Jones here reporting from Hawaii.
[00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.214]  We're off the island of Maui, and Democrat Congressman Hank Johnson believes that islands flow.
[00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.456]  We're about to see if his theory is correct.
[00:00:14.956 --> 00:00:19.159]  He also believes socialism works better than capitalism, which is similar to believing that islands flow.
[00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.442]  But let's see if he's correct, because after all, if you don't agree with him, you're racist.
[00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:27.345]  This is an island that, at its
[00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:34.755]  Widest level is what, 12 miles from shore to shore?
[00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:51.000]  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.001]  We don't anticipate that.
[00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.461]  Look, it's total proof.
[00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:05.505]  The island is the top of a mountain.
[00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.670]  And it just keeps going down 50,000 feet off the coast of Hawaii.
[00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.632]  The scientists are right.
[00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.395]  The Democrat hate cops is wrong.
[00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:12.417]  Total proof, look!
[00:01:18.977 --> 00:01:20.358]  Now, those are boats.
[00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:22.459]  Those do float.
[00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.081]  The pride of Maui is aluminum, and it floats on top of water.
[00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:28.102]  Rocks do not float on top of water.
[00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:33.926]  I would sign off as Alex Jones with Infowars.com, but now I identify as Hank Johnson, a black man from Atlanta.
[00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:37.368]  So, Hank Johnson for Infowars.com, signing off.
[00:01:37.588 --> 00:01:37.948]  Over and out.
[00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:59.139]  What happens when you put in a cage fight a giant in with a midget?
[00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:05.116]  Hey, Mr. Johnson, I've got a quick question for you.
[00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:07.358]  Have you ever, um... Oh, yeah.
[00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:08.919]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.381]  Hey, Alex Jones, the little people!
[00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:11.961]  And, and, Guam.
[00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:16.885]  I've always wanted to ask you, that was a joke, but he said Guam floating, right?
[00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:17.545]  It was.
[00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:22.369]  This is a, uh, island that, at its
[00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:29.759]  The widest level is what, 12 miles from shore to shore?
[00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:43.794]  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[00:02:45.877 --> 00:02:48.079]  Uh, we don't anticipate that.
[00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:48.799]  That's what I thought.
[00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:49.820]  Yeah.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.601]  You're a man with a sense of humor.
[00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:52.482]  That's right.
[00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:53.383]  I always knew that.
[00:02:53.683 --> 00:03:02.409]  Well, I always, when I'm watching C-SPAN, I see you talking, and then you say some really witty stuff, and sometimes you say some really ridiculous stuff, and I think, I think people are maybe, like, doing something to me, taking stuff out of context.
[00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.593]  The midget will not win the fight, I'm gonna tell you that.
[00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:08.031]  Why?
[00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:10.633]  It just doesn't carry enough weight.
[00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:22.279]  As I am prone to do, I use a lot of analogies and so last night I used an analogy that some find offensive.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:31.705]  Just within the last 12 hours or so, I have found that the use of the midget, excuse me, the use of the M word
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.042]  Is no longer socially acceptable.
[00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:42.064]  I think we may both have that dilemma.
[00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:47.787]  Even the Washington Post admits, Google location, when you turn it off, they still track it.
[00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:51.689]  So, you know, Sundar's a nice, likable fella, but he's not telling the truth.
[00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.732]  Well, I think we have to get more, we've got to get more precise with our questions.
[00:03:57.752 --> 00:03:59.553]  We've got to get it tight, get it right?
[00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:03.115]  Perhaps if we had more than five minutes, we could do it, or not that.
[00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:04.781]  I agree.
[00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:09.322]  What do you think about Google helping censor the Chinese with their dragonfly operation?
[00:04:09.622 --> 00:04:18.704]  I think that when you are in a foreign country doing business, you do business in accordance with that country's policies.
[00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:23.985]  And so it's a difficult situation in this global environment.
[00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:25.025]  What about these folks?
[00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:27.405]  Two million Muslims to put concentration camps?
[00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:28.866]  I know nothing about all of that.
[00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:29.706]  Here he is.
[00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:34.771]  So, this is kind of an unwieldy situation.
[00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:36.513]  Good to meet you, too.
[00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:37.213]  Good luck to you.
[00:04:37.253 --> 00:04:38.194]  Where is the Colonel?
[00:04:38.234 --> 00:04:40.197]  I'll see you on the lawn.
[00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:08.412]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:14.795]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way.
[00:05:15.135 --> 00:05:17.616]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits.
[00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:21.241]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:27.770]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:34.080]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.605]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[00:05:41.845 --> 00:05:48.730]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.293]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[00:05:53.773 --> 00:06:01.158]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at infowarestore.com.
[00:06:15.077 --> 00:06:18.838]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:20.839]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:28.042]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:36.365]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:06:36.806 --> 00:06:39.286]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:40.787]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:06:41.127 --> 00:06:43.028]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:45.370]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.691]  This is all confirmed.
[00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:47.631]  This is not a drill.
[00:06:47.812 --> 00:06:51.754]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:53.496]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:06:53.616 --> 00:06:54.096]  Apple 100%.
[00:06:54.497 --> 00:07:00.121]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:05.345]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:07:05.645 --> 00:07:06.506]  This is happening.
[00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:14.472]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:07:14.552 --> 00:07:20.516]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:07:20.917 --> 00:07:28.883]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[00:07:29.743 --> 00:07:33.306]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:37.068]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:07:37.088 --> 00:07:44.113]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:07:44.353 --> 00:07:47.015]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:52.299]  Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control system.
[00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:54.240]  It is the virtual reality AI
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.484]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:23.577]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:08:23.617 --> 00:08:28.501]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:33.765]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a murderer of children.
[00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:41.791]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:49.057]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:08:49.137 --> 00:08:54.842]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:59.806]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:08:59.826 --> 00:09:01.907]  I have given you the transmission.
[00:09:01.988 --> 00:09:02.488]  Now break
[00:09:06.677 --> 00:09:15.581]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:18.642]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:09:18.742 --> 00:09:22.663]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:32.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, December 14th, 2018.
[00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.731]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.352]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:09:36.432 --> 00:09:39.654]  And of course, you've got The War Room with Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others.
[00:09:39.814 --> 00:09:41.115]  Kicks off every day, 3 p.m.
[00:09:41.135 --> 00:09:41.515]  Central.
[00:09:42.215 --> 00:09:45.637]  We come right back in the morning with InfoWars Live Transmission with David Knight.
[00:09:45.677 --> 00:09:47.878]  Weekdays, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.899]  to 11 a.m., right before this broadcast.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.482]  I talked about basically the same subject at the start of the broadcast yesterday.
[00:09:57.219 --> 00:10:19.606]  Radio slash TV syndicated transmission that I look at the news and I read the news and then I see what's happening on the street in my own life and what's happening in the schools and the churches and the grocery stores and the farms and factories and I get very very angry and that it's hard for me to then really go on air.
[00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:26.628]  So that's why I have to explain to folks why I either have to be very cynical about things on air or
[00:10:28.038 --> 00:10:30.139]  I'm going to start screaming and yelling, or maybe even crying.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:39.584]  Because when you really do care, and you see a bunch of other people that don't, you get angry.
[00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:55.272]  And you witness how the establishment, these creatures, play on our weakest issues, play on our
[00:10:56.843 --> 00:11:07.471]  Lesser angels and how they divide and conquer us and how they poison us and how they give us disinformation from birth and how they target the children.
[00:11:08.852 --> 00:11:09.672]  It enrages me.
[00:11:10.133 --> 00:11:11.474]  You know, I don't just read the newspapers.
[00:11:11.854 --> 00:11:13.795]  I have my own personal experiences just like you do.
[00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:17.358]  And every year at the start of school, I
[00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:34.926]  See, on the streets of America, and I hear about it from friends, family, and neighbors, and I hear about it from my own children, I have four children, about young people that go get their vaccine and have a convulsion and are in the hospital.
[00:11:38.327 --> 00:11:44.629]  I also have a lot of friends, a lot of friends, whose two, three, four-year-olds come down with quote, type 1 diabetes.
[00:11:46.076 --> 00:11:47.598]  And they say, well, it's not from their diet.
[00:11:47.698 --> 00:11:48.539]  It must be genetic.
[00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:51.682]  Well, yeah, it's genetic that they got permanent pancreatitis.
[00:11:52.122 --> 00:11:56.066]  And the insert says it can shut down the flu shot.
[00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:00.150]  Says it could shut down your pancreas forever.
[00:12:02.072 --> 00:12:08.258]  And then school's out forever because your pancreas has been blown to pieces.
[00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:27.404]  And just like I opened the show up yesterday with all the thousands of deaths and people paralyzed by polio-like disease, but they won't say it's polio and, oh, they can't treat it and they don't want to talk about it and they tell you that, well, we're not going to report it.
[00:12:27.724 --> 00:12:31.065]  The CDC has said to hospitals, don't report this publicly.
[00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:37.147]  Do it in our secret reporting system that they use for the secret experimentation and the secret taking of blood at birth for 46 years.
[00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:43.123]  Under secret law, which we first exposed 20 years ago.
[00:12:43.703 --> 00:12:46.244]  There were then lawsuits in Texas and Minnesota, all confirmed.
[00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:51.327]  And the National Secret Worldwide Database was then discovered, run by the United Nations.
[00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:54.969]  I digress.
[00:12:56.369 --> 00:12:59.251]  I have all this incredible news, but look what I saw in my stacks!
[00:12:59.431 --> 00:13:01.072]  And I saw several others in the stacks.
[00:13:01.452 --> 00:13:03.733]  They're not even looking for vaccine damage news.
[00:13:03.893 --> 00:13:04.814]  It's there, they can't hide it.
[00:13:05.274 --> 00:13:06.335]  Rufo Regno!
[00:13:07.615 --> 00:13:08.776]  He almost died!
[00:13:11.243 --> 00:13:21.370]  And even the New York Post, even People Magazine, says the Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, hospitalized after pneumonia vaccination goes wrong.
[00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:28.655]  But every year when they get ready to shoot your kids up before school starts, what do they say on the news?
[00:13:31.357 --> 00:13:35.160]  They say safe and effective, might make the injection site sore,
[00:13:36.283 --> 00:13:40.326]  It's a conspiracy theory by the guy that says Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[00:13:40.346 --> 00:13:41.327]  They always throw that in there.
[00:13:41.347 --> 00:13:43.888]  A lot of articles.
[00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:49.232]  In fact, hundreds every year at the start of school say Alex Jones says this and, well, he's a racist.
[00:13:50.713 --> 00:13:53.715]  Meanwhile, my grandmother got polio.
[00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:56.117]  My uncle almost died from a tetanus shot.
[00:13:57.298 --> 00:14:02.782]  I literally know multiple people in this building where the vaccines killed their children.
[00:14:05.363 --> 00:14:05.744]  Killed them!
[00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:07.478]  As in dead!
[00:14:09.579 --> 00:14:10.800]  And still people won't listen to me.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.442]  Lou Ferrigno, we'll tell you more about this, but I'm not going to get to it this hour.
[00:14:16.682 --> 00:14:21.804]  So you get into geopolitical stuff and economic things and the UN worldwide funding Marxist style race war.
[00:14:22.084 --> 00:14:23.044]  That's all coming up first.
[00:14:23.104 --> 00:14:27.066]  I'm going to set all the vaccine deaths and illnesses and people paralyzed.
[00:14:27.426 --> 00:14:28.446]  I'm going to set this aside.
[00:14:30.487 --> 00:14:32.708]  Yeah, you take the pneumonia shot, you get pneumonia.
[00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:34.168]  You take the flu shot, you get flu.
[00:14:34.388 --> 00:14:35.769]  Everybody knows this.
[00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:42.033]  My mother was not in professional sports when she was younger.
[00:14:42.053 --> 00:14:43.874]  Didn't start competitively swimming until she was 35.
[00:14:44.494 --> 00:14:49.377]  And then she was on the UT Masters, won silver medals, gold medals at national competitions.
[00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:52.878]  I mean, she was beating former Olympic athletes.
[00:14:53.299 --> 00:14:58.021]  And UT told her at about 43, told them all, take your flu shot.
[00:14:58.541 --> 00:15:00.102]  We've got some big meats coming up.
[00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.884]  And she took it and almost killed my mama.
[00:15:03.204 --> 00:15:04.725]  She was in bed for a month.
[00:15:05.819 --> 00:15:10.260]  She lost 25 pounds and she never came back to where she was ever again.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.961]  I warn you again, folks.
[00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:18.923]  You can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit somebody that got killed or almost killed by this crap!
[00:15:21.343 --> 00:15:21.884]  So I'm pissed.
[00:15:22.724 --> 00:15:24.664]  And I say it's time to stop playing damn games.
[00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:26.385]  Excuse me.
[00:15:26.845 --> 00:15:30.006]  I see I'm having real angry issues right now and it's not an act.
[00:15:30.922 --> 00:15:32.783]  And I apologize for using the Lord's name in vain.
[00:15:32.823 --> 00:15:33.704]  I don't intend it as that.
[00:15:34.004 --> 00:15:36.265]  You hear preachers saying, God says you'll be damned to hell.
[00:15:36.525 --> 00:15:40.548]  All I'm saying is, God, please damn these people to hell that know what they're doing.
[00:15:42.329 --> 00:15:44.630]  And please support us, because the global's trying to shut us down.
[00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.071]  You know that.
[00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:46.211]  Biggest sales ever.
[00:15:46.732 --> 00:15:47.752]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:15:48.132 --> 00:15:49.153]  50 to 75% off.
[00:15:49.253 --> 00:15:50.434]  And a free t-shirt with every order.
[00:15:50.694 --> 00:15:51.895]  These are major loss leaders.
[00:15:52.235 --> 00:15:53.356]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:15:53.396 --> 00:15:54.336]  Without you, we won't be here.
[00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:55.757]  Do your Christmas shopping there.
[00:15:55.777 --> 00:15:57.098]  Don't fight the crowds in traffic.
[00:15:57.138 --> 00:15:58.199]  And help fund the Infowar.
[00:15:58.399 --> 00:15:59.439]  A total of 360 wins.
[00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:00.440]  Thank you for your support.
[00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.331]  2018 has come and it's almost gone.
[00:16:05.112 --> 00:16:07.032]  And it's been one incredible year.
[00:16:07.072 --> 00:16:08.293]  It's been a serious fight.
[00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:13.115]  But nationalism and populism and Christianity are coming back across the world.
[00:16:13.135 --> 00:16:17.577]  Thanks to God shining through you and your family.
[00:16:17.637 --> 00:16:19.358]  Thanks to you taking action.
[00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:22.579]  So I want to thank you for what you've done.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.982]  You are literally the strength, the blood, the guts, the win in our sails.
[00:16:28.342 --> 00:16:28.682]  Literally.
[00:16:29.775 --> 00:16:31.556]  So I want to salute you and thank you for what you've done.
[00:16:31.576 --> 00:16:40.978]  And I want to encourage you to get great products like the supplements and the water filtration, the air filtration, the Patriot apparel, all of it, at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:16:40.998 --> 00:16:46.040]  If you get your orders in by the 19th, you're guaranteed to get it in the continental United States before Christmas.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.160]  Don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds.
[00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:55.723]  Go there, get great products that you and your family need that are game-changing, that are life-changing, and help us fund into the new year.
[00:16:56.163 --> 00:16:56.503]  Help us
[00:16:58.132 --> 00:17:03.083]  Stand against George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the globalists.
[00:17:03.324 --> 00:17:03.745]  Help us!
[00:17:05.268 --> 00:17:08.089]  Stand in the way of their plans and their operations.
[00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:20.453]  At the same time, getting amazing products like BODY's Ultimate Tumor Formula, and X2 and X3, and SuperBell Vitality, and Brain Force, and Lung Cleanse, and Knockout, and Alpha Power, and so many other amazing products.
[00:17:20.913 --> 00:17:25.394]  Whatever the best products are, we do the research, and that's what we bring you, because we want to work for you.
[00:17:25.735 --> 00:17:27.555]  We want it to be amazing, so you order it again.
[00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:29.756]  We treat you just like we want to be treated.
[00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:32.356]  Because we respect you, and we appreciate you.
[00:17:32.456 --> 00:17:38.418]  You know, the golden rule, do unto others as you have them do unto you, and the Christ rule, lay down your life for others.
[00:17:38.478 --> 00:17:40.698]  Isn't that the world you want to live in?
[00:17:41.138 --> 00:17:45.219]  With a bunch of heroes, people that are ready to fight and stand up, instead of a bunch of backstabbing cowards?
[00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:47.820]  That's the world that builds civilization.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.100]  That's the world that builds it all.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.761]  So when I treat you like I want to be treated, it's because I respect myself and I respect you.
[00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:59.302]  InfoWarsTore.com, biggest sales ever, free shipping store-wide, and so much more, but it's your last chance.
[00:17:59.322 --> 00:17:59.882]  Please take action.
[00:18:01.451 --> 00:18:07.894]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:18:09.614 --> 00:18:11.055]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:18:11.295 --> 00:18:14.516]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double-paid reappoints.
[00:18:17.378 --> 00:18:23.320]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:30.162]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free colloidal silver iodine fortified super blue that we make like three bucks on at this sale.
[00:18:30.562 --> 00:18:31.743]  You'll get a free gift
[00:18:32.523 --> 00:18:58.678]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[00:18:59.935 --> 00:19:06.259]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[00:19:06.699 --> 00:19:08.440]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.443]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[00:19:13.904 --> 00:19:14.424]  It's big.
[00:19:14.944 --> 00:19:15.365]  It's bad.
[00:19:15.785 --> 00:19:21.028]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[00:19:21.048 --> 00:19:23.329]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.972]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[00:19:27.593 --> 00:19:28.536]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:19:28.576 --> 00:19:29.740]  That's been going on for over a month.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.746]  50 to 75% off.
[00:19:31.766 --> 00:19:32.770]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:34.771]  The Double Patriot points.
[00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:35.712]  That's what happened in about a week.
[00:19:36.052 --> 00:19:42.694]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[00:19:43.134 --> 00:19:47.535]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:49.436]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:19:49.696 --> 00:19:51.496]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:19:51.696 --> 00:19:53.737]  And don't fight the crowds at infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:53.917 --> 00:19:57.918]  And from myself and the Infowars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:07.980]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.843 --> 00:20:27.828]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:20:28.148 --> 00:20:32.350]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:58.817]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got the rat coming clean, Mr. Cohen, one of Trump's disgraced lawyers, giving his so-called interview to 60 Minutes.
[00:20:58.877 --> 00:20:59.839]  That's going to be coming up.
[00:21:02.338 --> 00:21:09.020]  We're also going to get to, obviously, the massive news of the UN trying to stir up race war all over the planet.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:16.443]  They've got major leaders in South Africa, top politicians, the heads of major parties, saying we will kill their children and women.
[00:21:17.163 --> 00:21:20.724]  Fury over black South African politicians called to kill whites.
[00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:24.400]  I'm gonna pull up Khalid Mohamed, he's still on YouTube.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.680]  We kill the women?
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.320]  We kill the children?
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.041]  We kill the babies?
[00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:33.062]  You say, why do you kill those little beautiful blonde-haired, blue-eyed babies?
[00:21:33.682 --> 00:21:40.043]  Because every nine months, a white woman lays down on her back and military enforcements roll out.
[00:21:40.703 --> 00:21:42.704]  So I say, kill them all!
[00:21:46.585 --> 00:21:51.026]  That's what's taught by the communists in the United States, and that's what's taught by the communists in South Africa.
[00:21:52.168 --> 00:21:56.611]  And it ties in to even mainstream politica.
[00:21:57.412 --> 00:21:58.533]  All these years later.
[00:21:58.913 --> 00:22:10.902]  Hell, Paul Watson went to several European countries a few years ago, and he offered a huge bounty, a large amount of money, to any mainstream media that would go to these no-go zones.
[00:22:11.002 --> 00:22:13.904]  And when they went there, they found out that, indeed, people tried to kill them.
[00:22:14.245 --> 00:22:17.467]  Now the no-go zones are most areas of cities.
[00:22:17.527 --> 00:22:19.249]  I mean, it's just hellish.
[00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:21.272]  And here's Politico!
[00:22:21.892 --> 00:22:27.035]  Sweden's violent reality is undoing a peaceful self-image.
[00:22:29.937 --> 00:22:34.640]  But you read it, and it's nothing about it being Muslims, 90% of the crime.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.780]  Hilarious!
[00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:37.622]  Wow!
[00:22:38.962 --> 00:22:40.043]  Unbelievable!
[00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:45.046]  So we'll be looking into all that, and this is really the biggest news of the day.
[00:22:45.746 --> 00:22:46.347]  So I want to
[00:22:48.268 --> 00:22:49.630]  Spend some time on it coming up.
[00:22:49.910 --> 00:23:00.525]  French generals accuse Macron, and these are acting generals, major generals, and others, of treason over UN migration pact.
[00:23:02.073 --> 00:23:03.453]  And they go on to say, that's what it is.
[00:23:03.553 --> 00:23:03.794]  Wow.
[00:23:04.314 --> 00:23:08.915]  No one would talk about the UN Migration Pact two years ago, when we were talking about it, or six months ago, or a month ago.
[00:23:08.955 --> 00:23:10.276]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:23:10.656 --> 00:23:17.198]  And the French military is saying, we may have to remove you, and the public has a right to revolt.
[00:23:18.578 --> 00:23:21.299]  Wait till we get to that.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.201]  And oh, the Egyptian president has come out and said,
[00:23:28.124 --> 00:23:48.357]  That the left is organizing Islam into an invasion force to take down Europe, and that Muslims should openly assimilate and decry the leftist alliance with radical forms of Islam like Wahhabism, or that it's going to basically trigger a clash of civilizations.
[00:23:48.977 --> 00:23:49.918]  And he's a good guy.
[00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:51.699]  He's pro-Trump, pro-America.
[00:23:51.739 --> 00:23:54.861]  Egyptian president blast migrants on assimilating in Europe.
[00:23:55.717 --> 00:24:02.799]  And says, they have built superior technology and superior culture, and that we need to adopt it.
[00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:05.520]  Now that's just being honest.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:13.422]  Just like in Egypt 5,000 years ago, people were trying to get in there, because they had superior technology, you need to adopt Egyptian culture.
[00:24:13.922 --> 00:24:20.044]  And so he's telling people, listen, you don't want to ally yourself with the globalists on the left, you're crazy.
[00:24:21.864 --> 00:24:24.305]  So see, from Russia, to Poland,
[00:24:25.643 --> 00:24:28.525]  To the United States, to England, to Brazil, to everywhere.
[00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.066]  People are getting it.
[00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:33.489]  Big megacorporations are allied with China and the Communists.
[00:24:33.949 --> 00:24:34.890]  Radical Islam.
[00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.751]  God-hating leftists.
[00:24:37.492 --> 00:24:41.315]  And everybody's going, whoa, we don't want to be part of this.
[00:24:42.155 --> 00:24:44.077]  We don't want to blow up America and Europe.
[00:24:44.097 --> 00:24:45.838]  We're not enemies with you.
[00:24:46.158 --> 00:24:48.360]  We don't want to be played in this game.
[00:24:50.202 --> 00:24:55.723]  So suddenly everything we've talked about in our basic nomenclature, you see, is the speech of the world now.
[00:24:56.504 --> 00:25:10.888]  Our terms, like world government, global governance, new world order, tax-exempt foundations, diplomatic immunity for the UN, carbon taxes, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[00:25:13.973 --> 00:25:15.776]  Weaponize third world populations.
[00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:17.018]  Now it's on.
[00:25:17.138 --> 00:25:20.343]  Because we forced the terms into common use.
[00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:23.769]  And we've exposed how the world really works.
[00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.374]  After them stonewalling for decades while they built this monster.
[00:25:28.467 --> 00:25:34.770]  And now, we've got a good chance of beating these people, but we had to admit there was a global criminal government forming.
[00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.791]  We had to admit it was allied with radical Islam.
[00:25:36.991 --> 00:25:39.753]  We had to admit they're targeting our children and our families.
[00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:43.334]  It was hard to admit when they were first building it, because who wants to admit this?
[00:25:43.394 --> 00:25:43.895]  It's crazy!
[00:25:45.175 --> 00:25:52.939]  But now that it's emerging, and now that we're really facing it, we now know who the enemy is, and we're going to win.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.361]  In fact, look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:03.879]  Paris police braced for more violent protests.
[00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:19.282]  Now the government admits, you are nationalists, you are French, we've brought in 10 million illegal aliens, they're crapping all over the ground, everything's going bankrupt, we shouldn't have 85% taxes, and the EU says that they're about to fall, that the global order is collapsing.
[00:26:19.842 --> 00:26:24.063]  You mean the global order of breaking the social compact and overrunning our countries and enslaving us?
[00:26:27.113 --> 00:26:32.757]  Yes, that order is in trouble because humanity is now awakening, and the process is accelerating.
[00:26:33.577 --> 00:26:38.400]  And there's only a few ways the globalists could stop this now, but I'm going to break those down on the other side.
[00:26:41.302 --> 00:26:43.503]  Next year's news today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:43.864 --> 00:26:46.405]  We're going to have our reporters there again this weekend on the ground.
[00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:50.568]  Dan Lyman got shot at, saw men and women have their eyes blown out by the French.
[00:26:53.277 --> 00:26:54.038]  I stopped myself.
[00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:55.339]  Most of them weren't French.
[00:26:55.779 --> 00:27:01.503]  The big blue armored vehicles with the UN-controlled EU symbol on it with mercenaries.
[00:27:01.883 --> 00:27:04.865]  For the first time since 1945, foreign troops.
[00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:07.147]  Oh, and what do these generals cite as treason?
[00:27:08.468 --> 00:27:10.489]  And the need to remove the entire traitorous government.
[00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.232]  They cite the armored EU vehicles.
[00:27:16.129 --> 00:27:17.510]  See how they hid that in plain view?
[00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:22.754]  Foreign mercs, many of them, on your streets, suppressing you.
[00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:24.375]  Foreign troops.
[00:27:26.077 --> 00:27:26.917]  What did I say?
[00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:30.480]  On Sunday and Monday, foreign troops treason.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.943]  France invaded for the first time since World War II by a foreign power.
[00:27:34.223 --> 00:27:35.584]  Macron liked the Vichy French.
[00:27:35.644 --> 00:27:39.727]  And now, in the letters written by the top generals, they say exactly that.
[00:27:40.128 --> 00:27:41.229]  They didn't get that from me.
[00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:42.269]  They know history.
[00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.071]  They're seeing it happen.
[00:27:45.472 --> 00:27:49.515]  You're seeing France being conquered, but not without a shot being fired.
[00:27:49.655 --> 00:27:53.918]  The mercs are there, targeting men and women, shooting them in the face with rubber bullets.
[00:27:55.339 --> 00:27:59.602]  I predict that will cause the violent overthrow of the French government by the military.
[00:28:00.583 --> 00:28:04.767]  And I salute it, because it's not the French government.
[00:28:05.188 --> 00:28:10.753]  It's an occupied criminal collaborator group of dirtbags that need to be removed.
[00:28:11.093 --> 00:28:17.459]  And if they continue to struggle and try to sell the country out and lower its defenses and bankrupt it and bring in third world populations to act as their...
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.703]  Political force to burn cities anytime they want?
[00:28:21.324 --> 00:28:30.174]  Then these so-called French leaders who are really collaborators need to be dealt with just like collaborators were dealt with in 1942, 43, 44, and 45.
[00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:33.799]  They need to be swinging from the ends of ropes!
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.122]  And they will be if they keep pushing it.
[00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:39.590]  Junker, Macron, I'm not threatening them.
[00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:50.735]  I'm telling them, just like Mussolini and Hitler and the Vichy French, Toto and all of them, you're gonna be swinging from the ends of ropes, you little snot-nosed Rothschild sex toy.
[00:28:51.595 --> 00:28:54.236]  So you better know when to back down, you piece of filth.
[00:28:55.837 --> 00:28:57.618]  The French are awakening, and that's a good thing.
[00:28:58.718 --> 00:28:59.338]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.358 --> 00:28:59.819]  Stay with us.
[00:29:07.888 --> 00:29:09.789]  Google is evil!
[00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:13.050]  Google is evil!
[00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:17.351]  Google is going to volunteer and violate the law?
[00:29:17.391 --> 00:29:18.732]  That's enough, Nick.
[00:29:18.752 --> 00:29:19.572]  Too much noise.
[00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:24.114]  I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.
[00:29:27.426 --> 00:29:39.070]  Before we delve into these questions, I must first dispense with a completely illegitimate issue, which is the fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives that Google and other online platforms have an anti-conservative bias.
[00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.910]  But what if Google was lying to you?
[00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:45.912]  As I've said repeatedly, no credible evidence supports this right-wing conspiracy theory.
[00:29:46.012 --> 00:29:51.273]  Here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activism.
[00:29:51.293 --> 00:29:54.374]  When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come into the top
[00:29:54.714 --> 00:30:04.277]  Well, Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:30:04.317 --> 00:30:06.078]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:30:06.358 --> 00:30:09.559]  Does the United States need a national privacy law?
[00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:11.159]  They're gonna talk about me in this committee.
[00:30:11.359 --> 00:30:12.139]  I will be talked about.
[00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:13.920]  So what am I supposed to do?
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.020]  I don't get a day in court.
[00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:16.161]  They lie about me.
[00:30:16.321 --> 00:30:17.801]  Google only puts lies up.
[00:30:18.121 --> 00:30:20.162]  All the top searches are lies about me and my family.
[00:30:20.322 --> 00:30:24.785]  The other issue I wanted to just raise in my last minute is moderating hate speech.
[00:30:24.825 --> 00:30:25.665]  Hate speech.
[00:30:25.726 --> 00:30:26.326]  Hate speech.
[00:30:26.386 --> 00:30:26.886]  Hate speech.
[00:30:27.006 --> 00:30:27.567]  Hate speech.
[00:30:27.667 --> 00:30:28.407]  Hate speech.
[00:30:28.567 --> 00:30:29.908]  And bullying policies.
[00:30:29.988 --> 00:30:35.052]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[00:30:35.172 --> 00:30:36.673]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[00:30:36.693 --> 00:30:38.234]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[00:30:38.674 --> 00:30:40.115]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar.
[00:30:40.715 --> 00:30:48.122]  This has come up in a number of different ways, and we appreciate the work that you have done, particularly with YouTube.
[00:30:48.202 --> 00:30:53.126]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier, promoting conspiracy theories.
[00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:58.470]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.152]  We're aware of his lying to Congress.
[00:31:00.172 --> 00:31:01.773]  We're aware of him and the Dragonfly Project.
[00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:04.536]  It's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[00:31:04.816 --> 00:31:06.217]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:10.478]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[00:31:10.538 --> 00:31:11.199]  Translation?
[00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:15.780]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.840]  Google is evil!
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.141]  Google is evil!
[00:31:18.401 --> 00:31:21.062]  Google would love to have me arrested and killed.
[00:31:21.342 --> 00:31:22.422]  Guaranteed.
[00:31:28.579 --> 00:31:29.339]  InfoWars.
[00:31:29.479 --> 00:31:30.960]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.340]  Round one.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:33.981]  Fight Trump.
[00:31:34.021 --> 00:31:37.242]  The game where you deal for everything you ever wanted to own.
[00:31:37.382 --> 00:31:37.642]  Yes!
[00:31:37.802 --> 00:31:38.422]  Play Trump.
[00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:39.782]  The game from Milton Bradley.
[00:31:39.902 --> 00:31:40.743]  I think you'll like it.
[00:31:40.763 --> 00:31:47.044]  I don't know how you feel about this, but keep a gun in your house, and if you think someone's gonna assault you or rape you, blow their head off, man!
[00:31:47.064 --> 00:31:48.545]  Fire at them!
[00:31:48.665 --> 00:31:49.365]  Don't take it, man!
[00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:51.629]  Kenison was born in Peoria, Illinois.
[00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:56.112]  He died when a pickup truck slammed into his car near Needles, California last night.
[00:31:56.252 --> 00:32:01.417]  The body of Nirvana's lead singer and songwriter was found today in a guest cottage at his Seattle home.
[00:32:01.957 --> 00:32:06.081]  The medical examiner says he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
[00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:08.963]  All of a sudden, police brutality had a human face.
[00:32:09.303 --> 00:32:14.728]  The face belonged to Rodney King, a black male being brutally beaten and pitched by Los Angeles police officers.
[00:32:17.785 --> 00:32:21.368]  Oh, look at that.
[00:32:21.828 --> 00:32:22.309]  Terrible!
[00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:24.451]  And there's no police presence down here.
[00:32:24.571 --> 00:32:25.572]  Nobody's helping us.
[00:32:25.592 --> 00:32:27.153]  This is attempted murder.
[00:32:27.293 --> 00:32:37.521]  The three merchants walked out of the stores and they just started firing at everybody and anybody.
[00:32:42.639 --> 00:32:45.761]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.507 --> 00:33:16.470]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.552]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.623 --> 00:33:44.744]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live, Friday, worldwide broadcast.
[00:33:44.864 --> 00:33:45.904]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:48.305 --> 00:34:07.049]  I'm going to plunge right into the globalist's latest attempt to literally take over and take down the nation-states, and how people are battling back in just an incredible way, but also how the globalists are counter-striking against that, and the tactics they're using to stop it.
[00:34:08.422 --> 00:34:14.549]  And some of the other tactics they haven't quite completely used yet that we need to be aware of are in their quiver.
[00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.671]  So that's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:17.552 --> 00:34:20.536]  Tim Frugier and Pat Riley, two of the guys that work here.
[00:34:22.252 --> 00:34:28.637]  Are the guys a lot of times that bring me some Soros, Hillary funded lawsuit or you know, some new threat.
[00:34:28.657 --> 00:34:32.280]  A lot of times they bring me bad news, which I always demand to have immediately.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.644]  We're ready to face the day, not stick our heads in the sand in this fight for liberty.
[00:34:38.444 --> 00:34:46.670]  But they came in just about 15 minutes ago during the last break and said, hey boss, we've got some bad news for you.
[00:34:47.311 --> 00:34:48.172]  Bad news folder.
[00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:52.745]  And I said, what, another lawsuit or something like that, or somebody's dead?
[00:34:52.765 --> 00:34:54.585]  And they said, oh no, it's actually good news.
[00:34:55.066 --> 00:34:55.986]  Here's your present.
[00:34:56.026 --> 00:34:57.326]  So if you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[00:34:57.886 --> 00:34:59.107]  Again, I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:34:59.127 --> 00:35:00.127]  Can we zoom in a little bit more, please?
[00:35:00.187 --> 00:35:00.387]  Thanks.
[00:35:01.047 --> 00:35:11.230]  You can see there that it's Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, and Alex Jones on blue Christmas paper with snowflakes on it.
[00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.051]  So I don't know what this is, but I said, is this?
[00:35:15.956 --> 00:35:17.758]  Kosher for television.
[00:35:17.798 --> 00:35:19.399]  Can I can I open this on there?
[00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:24.263]  So this is a big surprise and I'm gonna not make you wait till the end of the show like other talk shows do to see what it is.
[00:35:24.984 --> 00:35:26.906]  I'm going to tear this open.
[00:35:26.926 --> 00:35:32.851]  I had to tell them is this custom wrapping paper and they said oh yes it's custom wrapping paper.
[00:35:34.072 --> 00:35:36.714]  So let's see what on earth this is.
[00:35:38.155 --> 00:35:39.657]  I know they seem really excited in there.
[00:35:42.318 --> 00:35:43.599]  I just dropped whatever it is behind me.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.761]  That just builds the suspense even more.
[00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:47.883]  It just slid out on the ground over there.
[00:35:48.824 --> 00:35:49.525]  Will somebody bring that to me?
[00:35:49.545 --> 00:35:49.845]  Thank you.
[00:35:50.866 --> 00:35:53.409]  So it's two pieces of cardboard with something sandwiched between it.
[00:35:53.669 --> 00:35:54.750]  I'm about to find out what it is.
[00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.252]  Thank you very much.
[00:35:58.814 --> 00:35:59.315]  Oh my God.
[00:36:02.758 --> 00:36:05.721]  Okay, it is a Brian Stelter calendar.
[00:36:07.154 --> 00:36:11.319]  And I will not be hanging this in the kitchen because that would cause me to not be able to enjoy my food.
[00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:16.726]  And I certainly won't be hanging it in the gym because that would be depressing.
[00:36:17.246 --> 00:36:20.130]  Maybe I can hang it, like, above the garbage cans in the garage.
[00:36:22.568 --> 00:36:25.530]  Now let's zoom out for radio listeners and TV viewers.
[00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:26.331]  Oh my goodness.
[00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:28.432]  So there is his head photoshopped.
[00:36:29.293 --> 00:36:30.894]  Or are these real photos of Brian Stelter?
[00:36:30.934 --> 00:36:31.975]  He really is into himself.
[00:36:32.596 --> 00:36:34.037]  He doesn't know how to... Oh my gosh.
[00:36:34.557 --> 00:36:38.360]  There he is moving a large stump.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.701]  It's a country boy.
[00:36:41.082 --> 00:36:41.802]  Oh my gosh.
[00:36:41.923 --> 00:36:42.943]  What in the hell is that?
[00:36:43.524 --> 00:36:46.766]  Brian Stelter with rose petals on his chest.
[00:36:47.767 --> 00:36:48.528]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:36:48.628 --> 00:36:50.149]  Brian Stelter as a leprechaun.
[00:36:53.072 --> 00:36:54.253]  Oh my gosh, here's another one.
[00:36:54.293 --> 00:36:57.374]  Brian Stelter as a child on Easter.
[00:36:58.675 --> 00:36:59.975]  Brian Stelter having a beer.
[00:36:59.995 --> 00:37:04.958]  Okay, well that is truly hideous.
[00:37:05.058 --> 00:37:08.459]  This obviously is not true.
[00:37:08.479 --> 00:37:10.240]  This is Brian Stelter wrapped in an American flag.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.180]  We know he hates America.
[00:37:12.581 --> 00:37:15.802]  Brian Stelter walking around in a backyard.
[00:37:17.423 --> 00:37:18.684]  Brian Stelter as a fireman.
[00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.411]  Again, he's in all of these sexy poses here.
[00:37:22.892 --> 00:37:24.333]  Brian Stelter in the pumpkin patch.
[00:37:24.973 --> 00:37:26.474]  Brian Stelter with a pumpkin pie.
[00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:29.276]  I'm not going to describe for listeners what he's doing with it.
[00:37:30.217 --> 00:37:33.379]  Brian Stelter, again, this is truly hideous.
[00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:36.821]  Okay, guys, you've outdone yourself.
[00:37:38.922 --> 00:37:40.363]  I really feel like I've been assaulted.
[00:37:40.423 --> 00:37:41.304]  Sorry for TV viewers.
[00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.530]  This is unbelievable.
[00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:49.932]  Why don't we hang this in one of the conference rooms and actually use it to put notes on?
[00:37:49.952 --> 00:37:53.414]  So it'll let us know and remind us who we're fighting here.
[00:37:53.434 --> 00:37:54.715]  Please, take it away.
[00:37:56.795 --> 00:37:57.796]  That's supposed to cheer me up.
[00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.077]  Take him off the screen, please.
[00:38:01.317 --> 00:38:02.298]  We've seen enough of Stelter.
[00:38:03.598 --> 00:38:03.859]  Thank you.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.320]  Gotta have some fun around here.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.141]  I think the guys are trying to do that.
[00:38:09.821 --> 00:38:10.141]  Stop!
[00:38:10.442 --> 00:38:10.722]  Stop!
[00:38:10.962 --> 00:38:11.242]  Stop!
[00:38:11.342 --> 00:38:11.622]  Stop!
[00:38:11.682 --> 00:38:11.902]  Stop!
[00:38:11.962 --> 00:38:12.202]  Stop!
[00:38:12.583 --> 00:38:12.983]  That's enough.
[00:38:13.223 --> 00:38:13.563]  Seriously.
[00:38:15.998 --> 00:38:16.918]  They're having a lot of fun in there.
[00:38:18.499 --> 00:38:19.799]  We're going to have a new t-shirt.
[00:38:19.919 --> 00:38:22.680]  The design just got sent off to our Texas printers.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.361]  It'll be out.
[00:38:27.041 --> 00:38:28.122]  It'll be done next week.
[00:38:28.302 --> 00:38:30.563]  We'll have them in by the new year.
[00:38:31.023 --> 00:38:34.704]  But we'll start pre-sales on these next week.
[00:38:36.024 --> 00:38:37.645]  And then again, you'll get them in the first of the year.
[00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:41.266]  But it is actually warms my heart.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:54.287]  And I'll just tell you, it has to do with Alexandra Cortez, the incredibly hilarious... I mean, she gives Hank Johnson a run for his money for being stupid.
[00:38:55.408 --> 00:38:59.631]  We're gonna have her, uh... Well, let's just say it involves a dog.
[00:39:01.278 --> 00:39:18.605]  And let's just say it involves Trump's tweet that his son put out that she said she's going to have him criminally investigated for and have him subpoenaed to Congress, which is illegal for his political activity, where Trump said, in America, in capitalist countries, we walk our dogs.
[00:39:19.766 --> 00:39:22.287]  In socialist countries like Venezuela,
[00:39:23.593 --> 00:39:24.433]  You eat your dogs.
[00:39:46.544 --> 00:39:50.548]  We're talking about a dog in every pot, is going to be Cortez's slogan.
[00:39:51.089 --> 00:39:59.698]  And just like we said, Hillary for prison, 2016 we launched that meme, you launched that meme, and it became incredibly powerful and had a massive, massive effect.
[00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:06.385]  We are going to make her head on a dog, and they're going to say, you're calling women dogs.
[00:40:06.465 --> 00:40:07.746]  No, just Cortez.
[00:40:08.553 --> 00:40:10.374]  A socialist... not a dog.
[00:40:11.295 --> 00:40:15.718]  We're saying we don't want her and her ignorance to be consumed by the socialism she's promoting.
[00:40:15.978 --> 00:40:19.000]  It kind of has that... a pun?
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.401]  Or is it a double entendre?
[00:40:20.641 --> 00:40:22.562]  Or it's... it has a double meaning.
[00:40:22.743 --> 00:40:26.345]  She's a dog, and we're saying let's not eat the dogs.
[00:40:27.246 --> 00:40:30.468]  It's the people that bring in socialism a lot of times who are idiots like her.
[00:40:30.488 --> 00:40:38.253]  And I think she probably believes in it, that don't understand it, and ends up literally destroying them and their country as people eat themselves alive.
[00:40:39.986 --> 00:40:40.266]  Okay.
[00:40:41.267 --> 00:40:43.327]  I'm going to get very focused and very serious now.
[00:40:44.808 --> 00:40:46.028]  And we're going to go to break.
[00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:48.289]  And come back.
[00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.131]  And I'm going to get into some good news.
[00:40:53.531 --> 00:40:55.092]  And then I'm going to get into some more good news.
[00:40:55.592 --> 00:40:56.972]  And then I'm going to get into some more good news.
[00:40:57.333 --> 00:41:00.154]  But then I will, I'm a little bit behind, get into the bad news.
[00:41:01.354 --> 00:41:02.275]  How they're striking back.
[00:41:04.255 --> 00:41:07.256]  Currently, and the other cards they've gotten a little hand.
[00:41:08.417 --> 00:41:08.557]  And
[00:41:09.995 --> 00:41:18.201]  We think we're winning right now, but if we don't recognize how they can counterpunch and how they probably will, then we could lose.
[00:41:19.982 --> 00:41:22.344]  And you don't want to lose to these people because they're so bad.
[00:41:22.744 --> 00:41:25.246]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:41:25.306 --> 00:41:32.371]  Please don't forget, you stand between InfoWars and the Hillary criminal mob and Soros and the Globalists.
[00:41:32.391 --> 00:41:34.533]  They publicly said get InfoWars off the air.
[00:41:35.033 --> 00:41:35.794]  They publicly said
[00:41:37.056 --> 00:41:42.319]  They shut down their free speech, they sicked all their systems on us and we're still standing.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:53.387]  And in some ways we're stronger, getting more AM and FM stations, more TV stations, more cable stations, more hardcore visitors to newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:41:53.407 --> 00:42:00.571]  But our reach, our tentacles as they would call them, as Brian Stelter calls them, tells me a virus, a diseased, I have tentacles.
[00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:03.233]  So I guess if you're an evil globalist, you know.
[00:42:03.837 --> 00:42:08.200]  I guess like a child molester would think police coming to bust him would be a, you know, a bad thing.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.080]  I'm not talking about Stelter.
[00:42:10.621 --> 00:42:12.542]  He looks like a child molester, like the archetypal one.
[00:42:12.562 --> 00:42:13.203]  I'm not saying he is.
[00:42:13.223 --> 00:42:16.565]  I'm saying he sees me as a liberty, as a patriot guy, as a bad guy.
[00:42:16.585 --> 00:42:19.086]  So he kind of sees me as a monster.
[00:42:19.106 --> 00:42:19.647]  I kind of get that.
[00:42:19.947 --> 00:42:26.111]  Kind of like a pedophile would think the cops busting down their door to save kids in a basement, you know, would be bad as well from his perspective.
[00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:28.032]  Not Stelter, a fictional pedophile.
[00:42:28.732 --> 00:42:30.393]  It would be something quite horrifying.
[00:42:31.754 --> 00:42:32.655]  Now, continuing here.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:44.404]  We have the biggest sales of the year running right now on supplements, on books, on water filtration, on DVDs, on great Patriot apparel, all of it.
[00:42:44.584 --> 00:42:50.047]  Storewide, free shipping, 50 to 75% off on everything in the store.
[00:42:50.127 --> 00:42:52.608]  Double Patriot points and a free t-shirt with every order.
[00:42:52.868 --> 00:42:55.289]  Many of these are lost liters, but it's an end-of-year inventory.
[00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:58.331]  Everything must go sales, so don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds.
[00:42:58.711 --> 00:43:00.752]  Go to InfoWareStore.com and help fight the InfoWare.
[00:43:08.263 --> 00:43:16.515]  Please, don't forget, we're running the biggest specials ever in InfoWars because Soros and the Globalists are on record trying to take all of our payment processors and totally shut us down.
[00:43:16.715 --> 00:43:18.017]  And so this is the war.
[00:43:18.037 --> 00:43:20.921]  They're taking everyone off the air they think is effective.
[00:43:20.941 --> 00:43:23.765]  But InfoWars is still standing because you financially supported us.
[00:43:24.225 --> 00:43:30.646]  I have usually inventory for five, six months in t-shirts and books and films and supplements, in coffee.
[00:43:30.826 --> 00:43:40.088]  This time, I am doing sales that are clearly 30, 40 percent bigger than they've ever been, because we have a plan to shell everything out of the warehouse.
[00:43:40.148 --> 00:43:42.968]  And we've already got the model ready to go with sponsors.
[00:43:43.188 --> 00:43:48.469]  Something you've seen me discard, you hear the radio, that's fine, but I've discarded sponsorship for about seven, eight years.
[00:43:48.489 --> 00:43:49.470]  It's been successful.
[00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.190]  Directly getting funding from you with great products, but if they take
[00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.110]  That way, don't worry.
[00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.072]  I've got all the big sponsors lined up as well.
[00:43:56.392 --> 00:43:57.592]  And if we keep both, that's even better.
[00:43:57.612 --> 00:43:59.313]  We'll just expand Battlefront even faster.
[00:43:59.353 --> 00:44:00.774]  But we're not giving up effort.
[00:44:00.794 --> 00:44:02.615]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[00:44:02.675 --> 00:44:09.618]  So, you need to support us, but you're supporting yourself, not fighting traffic, not fighting the crowds, getting great presents, helping the economy, all the rest of it.
[00:44:09.718 --> 00:44:11.018]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[00:44:11.098 --> 00:44:12.199]  Hey, we're all Alex Jones.
[00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:13.219]  Don't censor me.
[00:44:13.279 --> 00:44:13.960]  Gadsden flag.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:14.860]  Black on white t-shirts.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.381]  It's unisex for men and women.
[00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:16.961]  You pick your side.
[00:44:16.981 --> 00:44:17.181]  It's free.
[00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:17.841]  Free shipping.
[00:44:17.861 --> 00:44:19.222]  Double Patriot points in your next order.
[00:44:19.242 --> 00:44:20.443]  10% to the 5% of your dollar.
[00:44:20.463 --> 00:44:24.486]  You know, we have a special going where we have a special every day where something is 60% off.
[00:44:24.666 --> 00:44:26.527]  But go look at all the specials because some things are 75% off.
[00:44:47.982 --> 00:44:49.223]  And it's all flying out.
[00:44:49.383 --> 00:44:54.249]  Let me tell you, at the warehouse here in Austin, the little elves are working 24 hours a day.
[00:44:54.269 --> 00:44:57.392]  We brought on extra shifts, and thanks to you, we're selling it all out.
[00:44:57.653 --> 00:44:59.575]  The entire, everything.
[00:44:59.595 --> 00:44:59.835]  Boom!
[00:44:59.855 --> 00:45:00.035]  Gone.
[00:45:00.236 --> 00:45:01.056]  All gonna be gone.
[00:45:01.137 --> 00:45:03.199]  In fact, this new shirt, we printed out a lot of it.
[00:45:03.299 --> 00:45:04.380]  It's about to be gone.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.202]  We'll have a new shirt that we have inventory of.
[00:45:06.222 --> 00:45:07.724]  It'll be the new free shirt by tomorrow.
[00:45:07.904 --> 00:45:10.807]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:10.987 --> 00:45:18.073]  And we're going to sell out by Wednesday, they're saying, of the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration systems.
[00:45:18.113 --> 00:45:19.114]  Leading competitors are $600, $700.
[00:45:19.435 --> 00:45:20.576]  It's always a great deal at $240.
[00:45:20.636 --> 00:45:21.697]  Four-stage ion filter.
[00:45:21.717 --> 00:45:22.998]  The factory had a glut of those.
[00:45:23.018 --> 00:45:24.119]  They want to sell it as an inventory.
[00:45:24.239 --> 00:45:24.379]  It's $127.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.681]  They're selling them to us at cost.
[00:45:26.721 --> 00:45:27.382]  We make like $30.
[00:45:28.043 --> 00:45:29.604]  No deal is even near this.
[00:45:29.904 --> 00:45:31.706]  For you and your family, get an Alexa Pure Breeze now.
[00:45:31.746 --> 00:45:33.848]  But watch, the special will be gone just like Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:45:34.268 --> 00:45:34.729]  Water filters.
[00:45:34.769 --> 00:45:35.429]  Those did sell out.
[00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:36.150]  This will be gone.
[00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.693]  No one even gets close to this because we're the biggest distributor for this top company.
[00:45:39.873 --> 00:45:40.574]  We got this deal.
[00:45:40.734 --> 00:45:41.614]  No one else got this.
[00:45:41.694 --> 00:45:43.676]  You got this because the owner is a rabid listener.
[00:45:43.776 --> 00:45:44.277]  Matt Redhaugh.
[00:45:44.477 --> 00:45:45.938]  Boy, has he been harassed for being a supporter.
[00:45:46.098 --> 00:45:46.779]  Oh, let me tell you.
[00:45:46.839 --> 00:45:47.419]  I'm not supposed to.
[00:45:47.559 --> 00:45:48.320]  He's another patriot.
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.121]  So, we're here.
[00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:50.542]  We stand with those that stand with us.
[00:45:50.862 --> 00:45:51.923]  We thank you for supporting us.
[00:45:52.363 --> 00:45:53.284]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:45:53.324 --> 00:45:54.045]  Make that commitment.
[00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:54.545]  Get in there.
[00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:55.646]  Get the great products.
[00:45:55.666 --> 00:45:59.169]  Get the lowest prices and help fund the Second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:09.212]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[00:46:10.913 --> 00:46:13.914]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[00:46:14.034 --> 00:46:16.075]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[00:46:16.716 --> 00:46:20.538]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[00:46:21.018 --> 00:46:28.382]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[00:46:28.502 --> 00:46:30.923]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[00:46:34.364 --> 00:46:36.186]  We have seen what they want to do.
[00:46:36.226 --> 00:46:36.986]  They called it U.N.
[00:46:37.006 --> 00:46:38.788]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[00:46:38.808 --> 00:46:39.748]  2030 Agenda.
[00:46:40.009 --> 00:46:50.757]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[00:46:52.719 --> 00:46:56.002]  Never miss your show, any day.
[00:46:56.182 --> 00:46:58.163]  I mean, what?
[00:46:58.243 --> 00:46:58.964]  I mean, never!
[00:47:04.586 --> 00:47:07.205]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:25.861]  Big Brother.
[00:47:26.242 --> 00:47:27.483]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:28.044 --> 00:47:29.125]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:29.946 --> 00:47:31.388]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:32.730]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:33.311 --> 00:47:37.977]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:56.975]  So, I'm not going to sit here and list all the African countries, all the Latin American countries, all the Asian countries, all the European countries, Southern, Eastern, Western, the UK, the US, everywhere, nationalists and patriots are winning almost every election.
[00:47:57.395 --> 00:47:58.795]  People are awake to world government.
[00:47:58.835 --> 00:48:07.557]  They're awake to how foreign populations of untrained, unskilled people, military-age men, are being brought in and then being kept on welfare.
[00:48:08.752 --> 00:48:17.117]  And being allowed to commit massive crimes as a political detonator that the leftists can activate to burn down cities anytime they want.
[00:48:17.658 --> 00:48:24.522]  But see, the citizens, like the Yellow Vesters spreading worldwide, they can burn things down too.
[00:48:24.842 --> 00:48:34.589]  But instead of burning down the neighborhoods, like the Islamists are ordered to do, and then drive people out and move into those neighborhoods, the French can burn down
[00:48:35.868 --> 00:48:39.370]  The government officials' houses and cars, and in some cases, kill them.
[00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:48.214]  And that's why the French military, some of their top generals and others, have written a letter, currently serving generals, to Macron saying, you have battered our people.
[00:48:48.534 --> 00:48:49.395]  You have squeezed them.
[00:48:49.735 --> 00:48:53.377]  They're on the edge of total revolt, and they have a right to revolt.
[00:48:54.617 --> 00:48:56.338]  And you are involved in, quote, treason.
[00:48:57.719 --> 00:48:59.780]  Just like the Vichy French were with Hitler.
[00:49:01.377 --> 00:49:12.200]  What is it when you open your borders and announce, come here, everything's free, and then let your people be robbed and killed, and then raise taxes to pay foreign currency scam carbon trading bureaus money?
[00:49:14.161 --> 00:49:15.261]  You are a traitor.
[00:49:15.361 --> 00:49:16.121]  You are a criminal.
[00:49:16.581 --> 00:49:20.482]  French generals accuse Macron of treason over UN migration pact.
[00:49:20.943 --> 00:49:23.183]  Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com.
[00:49:24.344 --> 00:49:29.245]  Open letter says French citizens have another reason to revolt, and that's the globalism.
[00:49:30.262 --> 00:49:36.385]  And the generals mentioned the UN Migration Pact, which says that it circumvents national sovereignty.
[00:49:36.766 --> 00:49:41.728]  Even if a country doesn't want people in, the UN will bring them in.
[00:49:41.989 --> 00:49:47.512]  And the EU army says it will force them in if Italy or Macedonia or Greece don't accept it.
[00:49:48.832 --> 00:49:50.133]  Wow, that is beyond reason.
[00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:50.994]  That's an invasion.
[00:49:51.014 --> 00:49:54.656]  A group of French military generals have written an open letter to a
[00:49:55.768 --> 00:49:58.529]  Manuel Macron accusing the French President of committing treason.
[00:49:58.749 --> 00:50:00.030]  He's not a French President, he's a globalist.
[00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:05.952]  By signing the UN Migration Pact, the pact which was signed by 164 nations on Monday included France.
[00:50:07.073 --> 00:50:15.376]  It's not legally binding but greases the skids for unlimited migration to be treated as a human right and criticism of mass migration to be treated as hate speech.
[00:50:16.479 --> 00:50:17.300]  Already banning it in Europe.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:33.890]  A letter written by General Antonio Martinez and signed by 10 other generals, an admiral and a colonel, as well as former French Minister of Defense, Charles Malone, warns Macron that the move strips France of more sovereignty and provides an additional reason for an already battered people, to quote, revolt.
[00:50:38.274 --> 00:50:59.430]  And you read the letter, it gets hardcore and gets into the treason, and how they're ignoring the laws of the Republic, and how they're gonna bankrupt the nation by design, and the EU is basically scuttling France, and that the UN is doing it, that it's part of a greater Europe project to dominate France, and that the country's going to fall.
[00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:03.293]  And that they're, quote, erasing our civilization.
[00:51:05.795 --> 00:51:07.937]  And they go on to warn him, do not shine
[00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:15.962]  On, even though France says they've adopted, don't sign your own prison warrant.
[00:51:18.365 --> 00:51:23.552]  Meanwhile, Politico admits Sweden has one of the highest crime rates in the world, when just ten years ago it had the lowest crime rate in the world.
[00:51:23.572 --> 00:51:27.898]  And of course, 90% of the crime is the Islamicists.
[00:51:30.526 --> 00:51:32.648]  Meanwhile, we'll kill their children and women.
[00:51:32.768 --> 00:51:38.314]  Fury over black South African politician, the leader of one of the biggest parties, calls to kill whites.
[00:51:38.835 --> 00:51:47.624]  South Africans are outraged over a recent speech by local revolutionary socialist politician who called upon his followers to kill white people, including women, children, even pets owned by whites.
[00:51:50.245 --> 00:52:01.808]  Andel Mixonama, the leader of the, founder of the pan-Africanist political party, Black First and Land First, BLF, has been repeatedly heard using harsh language.
[00:52:01.968 --> 00:52:04.268]  And of course, right now, the current president talks like that.
[00:52:05.108 --> 00:52:06.108]  And the head of the Communist Party.
[00:52:06.128 --> 00:52:10.009]  They're like, wow, that looks like Antifa outfits they're wearing.
[00:52:10.049 --> 00:52:11.810]  Yes, this is all Marxist crap.
[00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:17.711]  Then once a country's brought down, these people are always killed by the new party that comes in.
[00:52:19.167 --> 00:52:21.428]  But then the resources are stolen by offshore corporations.
[00:52:21.788 --> 00:52:26.109]  And the Chinese are funding almost all of this, and that's on record, the Communist Chinese government.
[00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:32.331]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of this individual talking about they will kill their children and women.
[00:52:32.632 --> 00:52:33.072]  Here it is.
[00:52:34.832 --> 00:52:45.076]  We'll kill your children, we'll kill your women, we'll kill anything that we find!
[00:52:51.593 --> 00:53:00.203]  We kill the women, we kill the adults, we kill the girls, we kill anything that comes before us.
[00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:03.627]  We are organizing 50,000 RGG soldiers.
[00:53:04.728 --> 00:53:07.831]  You must please sign up.
[00:53:08.512 --> 00:53:10.815]  Sign your name up for being an RGG soldier.
[00:53:16.432 --> 00:53:21.035]  There's wind on there and it goes on.
[00:53:21.075 --> 00:53:22.816]  We're going to take your land and all the rest of it.
[00:53:22.836 --> 00:53:23.597]  Turn it off, please.
[00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:32.602]  Of course, he's using a microphone invented by Western culture and he's wearing Western clothes and he's standing on a stage in these big cities.
[00:53:34.043 --> 00:53:38.486]  There was almost no one in South Africa when the Dutch showed up 400 years ago.
[00:53:39.147 --> 00:53:42.749]  And then Africans and others poured in because of the jobs and the money.
[00:53:44.175 --> 00:53:45.495]  And the medicine and the rest of it.
[00:53:46.796 --> 00:53:50.657]  And then now, the murder rate's, what, ten times what it was under apartheid.
[00:53:50.677 --> 00:53:51.677]  I'm not defending apartheid either.
[00:53:51.877 --> 00:53:53.598]  They just traded out one evil for something even worse.
[00:53:54.238 --> 00:53:55.638]  And the whole society's collapsing.
[00:53:56.858 --> 00:53:59.939]  And then you've got the Communist Pan-African Party all over the place.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:13.363]  And once they've driven civilization out of there, the UN, CHICOM-funded, race-based black parties will then start killing the other blacks.
[00:54:14.534 --> 00:54:15.675]  And then everything will collapse.
[00:54:16.256 --> 00:54:19.779]  The Chinese love that because they don't ever build any infrastructure.
[00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:25.064]  They build their own cities with their own generators, put a fence up, and then they don't assimilate.
[00:54:25.104 --> 00:54:26.045]  They don't talk to anybody.
[00:54:26.505 --> 00:54:28.187]  They just take the resources and move out.
[00:54:30.409 --> 00:54:34.492]  Except they are taking criminals who served up to five years in forced labor.
[00:54:34.893 --> 00:54:38.056]  They're telling them, we will dump you out in Africa.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:47.728]  So they landed airfields and they just dumped criminals out, kind of like the British did to colonize Australia, but a lot of those weren't real criminals, obviously.
[00:54:47.748 --> 00:54:49.669]  A lot of these Chinese probably aren't real criminals either.
[00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:51.231]  It's just one hell of a deal.
[00:54:53.106 --> 00:54:58.929]  I mean China is taking Africa over, and man the Chinese are the most, they're great people.
[00:54:59.389 --> 00:55:00.669]  My sister's Korean adopted.
[00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:11.014]  The Koreans hate the Chinese, the Chinese hate the Koreans, even more than they hate the Japanese, and the Japanese absolutely hate the Chinese, and the Vietnamese hate the Chinese more than anybody.
[00:55:11.294 --> 00:55:12.615]  They had like five wars with them.
[00:55:14.595 --> 00:55:15.176]  But no one
[00:55:16.306 --> 00:55:17.046]  Even knows all this.
[00:55:17.106 --> 00:55:17.686]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:55:17.726 --> 00:55:22.688]  The Southern Poverty Law Center this year said there's the dangerous myth of white genocide in South Africa.
[00:55:23.168 --> 00:55:25.989]  Oh, we only saw a bunch of other countries have all the whites driven out.
[00:55:27.469 --> 00:55:28.189]  And mass murder.
[00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:31.370]  In Zimbabwe and all these other places.
[00:55:33.151 --> 00:55:34.971]  But the SPLC, why?
[00:55:35.531 --> 00:55:37.512]  They say there's no no-go zones in Europe.
[00:55:37.952 --> 00:55:39.552]  They say there's no sexual mutilation.
[00:55:40.313 --> 00:55:41.753]  They say there's nothing happening.
[00:55:43.553 --> 00:55:45.254]  They say if you don't let your five-year-old get
[00:55:46.243 --> 00:55:49.546]  Told he's really a girl, if he's a boy, or vice versa, you're bad too.
[00:55:49.586 --> 00:55:54.650]  Just let men, dressed like women, come talk to your kids in school about their sexuality.
[00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:56.391]  If they did it at the park, they'd get arrested.
[00:55:56.411 --> 00:56:01.115]  But if the school sanctions it, you don't want the Southern Poverty Law Center to talk bad about you, do you?
[00:56:01.135 --> 00:56:04.978]  Alright, I'll get more into it in the next hour and open the phones up, but let me just tell you.
[00:56:06.579 --> 00:56:08.321]  We're winning against this evil worldwide.
[00:56:08.601 --> 00:56:12.884]  But you see the globalist Marxist angle they use to destabilize of race war.
[00:56:12.964 --> 00:56:14.286]  They're trying it in Europe, they're trying it here.
[00:56:15.026 --> 00:56:17.548]  And they don't have a big enough population for race war, they import it.
[00:56:18.949 --> 00:56:19.830]  How are they countering it?
[00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:20.771]  With censorship?
[00:56:20.791 --> 00:56:22.572]  With calling you racist if you say no to it?
[00:56:23.133 --> 00:56:24.934]  If you say your nation even exists, you're bad?
[00:56:26.115 --> 00:56:28.357]  The racist groups they're organizing are just cannon fodder.
[00:56:28.377 --> 00:56:29.258]  They're just useful idiots.
[00:56:29.918 --> 00:56:31.340]  But they're also targeting
[00:56:32.551 --> 00:56:40.174]  They're also targeting the people that speak up and tell the truth, and presidents like President Trump and others, for destruction.
[00:56:40.574 --> 00:57:00.582]  They know they can't stop the wave of awakening all over the world, so instead they just want to pick off all the leadership of it, of any type of populist nationalist movement, so it can never actually then deliver the goods, by turning culture and society around, bringing in people that want to assimilate into Western culture and free market, and moving forward into
[00:57:01.567 --> 00:57:02.067]  The next level
[00:57:15.816 --> 00:57:23.122]  Then allowing the remnants of the West to then sign on to a mass genocide program to wipe out the entire third world population.
[00:57:23.603 --> 00:57:29.868]  That'll be about nine billion when the main extermination plan is released, according to my analysis and timelines.
[00:57:30.849 --> 00:57:31.850]  So that's the plan.
[00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:40.678]  I'm trying to not move to the level when the robot drones are going to release something like weaponized mouthpox with a 99% kill rate over South Africa.
[00:57:41.338 --> 00:57:46.525]  But the bases in many areas have already been built, and we're looking at fifth-generation delivery systems.
[00:57:47.006 --> 00:57:48.568]  These aren't your grandpa's helicopters.
[00:58:00.239 --> 00:58:06.283]  They should complain about the children being assed with!
[00:58:06.383 --> 00:58:07.463]  Not me showing you!
[00:58:07.563 --> 00:58:09.304]  You think I like seeing this crap?
[00:58:10.205 --> 00:58:11.826]  You think it doesn't piss me off?
[00:58:15.068 --> 00:58:16.729]  Let me tell you, I'm ready to kill people.
[00:58:16.969 --> 00:58:18.490]  I'm sick of this shit.
[00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:19.250]  Not literally.
[00:58:19.911 --> 00:58:21.772]  The point is, I'm getting sick of this crap.
[00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:24.213]  But I get into a rage and I apologize.
[00:58:25.714 --> 00:58:26.415]  But I really don't.
[00:58:26.675 --> 00:58:28.216]  I gotta plug or I'm gonna go bankrupt.
[00:58:28.236 --> 00:58:29.657]  The enemy's totally trying to shut us down.
[00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:34.863]  The enemy, all they ever say is we're not real, because they know damn well we're real.
[00:58:34.883 --> 00:58:36.204]  100%, 100% folks, I'm ready.
[00:58:36.504 --> 00:58:39.285]  I'm trying to figure out how to beat these people every damn second.
[00:58:39.985 --> 00:58:41.806]  Because my very cells cried against them.
[00:58:41.846 --> 00:58:45.608]  My very spirit is just on fire to defeat these people.
[00:58:45.768 --> 00:58:48.670]  And I want to spread the fire of liberty into your mind and others' minds.
[00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:50.591]  It's not my fire, it's God's fire.
[00:58:51.351 --> 00:58:57.737]  Let me tell you something, you ask Christ in your heart, not the fake devil you get at these churches, but the real Christ, you'll be on fire as well.
[00:58:57.797 --> 00:59:01.400]  And it's not a God of weakness, it's a God of strength and of overcoming these people.
[00:59:02.608 --> 00:59:06.789]  And I need your financial support so I can expand and support others and the work they're going to do.
[00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:11.550]  And quite frankly, the deals we have are so good, we're losing money on a lot of these, but I'm clearing my whole warehouse out.
[00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:19.092]  Free t-shirt with every order, 50-75% off, double Patriot points, and so much more at infowarestore.com.
[00:59:19.172 --> 00:59:19.872]  It is insane.
[00:59:20.172 --> 00:59:27.573]  Air filtration, water filtration, 60% off, all super blue, fluoride-free, coiled silver, iodine-fortified systems.
[00:59:27.593 --> 00:59:29.814]  They're about to sell out Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:59:29.854 --> 00:59:30.554]  They sold us at
[00:59:30.674 --> 00:59:33.655]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in resistance.
[01:00:11.201 --> 01:00:15.385]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:17.567]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.491 --> 01:00:47.474]  I intend to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:47.494 --> 01:00:52.556]  Then Matt Bracken will be hosting the fourth hour today, always doing an amazing job.
[01:00:52.956 --> 01:00:58.579]  Let me finish up with what I got to and what I covered in the last segment.
[01:00:59.499 --> 01:01:03.381]  And then we're gonna go to break and I'm gonna shift gears and get into a bunch of other stories we haven't got into yet.
[01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:13.330]  Most of the time in history, when you get hit by massive developments, people don't recognize it till later.
[01:01:15.251 --> 01:01:15.992]  That's an understatement.
[01:01:16.793 --> 01:01:18.274]  And victors write the history as well.
[01:01:18.334 --> 01:01:22.897]  But science took over in the last 200 years.
[01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:26.460]  There's been good parts of science and then bad parts, the way it's been used.
[01:01:27.581 --> 01:01:29.343]  And the way people were kept in the dark and how
[01:01:30.327 --> 01:01:39.851]  The black box nature of technology that you can hide Trojan horses into it or a lot of technology that's adopted supposedly has one use, but really it has a whole nother use.
[01:01:41.452 --> 01:01:42.772]  And you're just a cog within that.
[01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:46.214]  Just like Google and Apple and all the rest of it.
[01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:55.978]  But this diabolical world government system has something going for it.
[01:01:57.745 --> 01:02:04.007]  It's so horrible, it's so evil, it's so over the top, that people really have trouble grasping it.
[01:02:05.687 --> 01:02:16.850]  But that's also its weakness if people ever do begin to grasp it, and if it ever becomes interesting for people to learn how it works, like you learn how football works, you learn how baseball works.
[01:02:19.071 --> 01:02:22.432]  Men can learn all that complex stuff, or women know all about their favorite sitcom,
[01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:29.852]  Maybe they're into clothing or flowers or whatever it is, people, motorcycles.
[01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:54.004]  But if people ever got into how things really work, and the different thought processes and the different philosophies in world history, and that one of the dominant philosophies was developed by Plato, the chief philosopher of all time, the fount
[01:02:55.811 --> 01:03:00.073]  That you would know that Plato was basically like Adolf Hitler.
[01:03:00.814 --> 01:03:05.657]  In fact, most of what Adolf Hitler talked about and did came from Plato.
[01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:10.079]  And Friedrich Nietzsche, who Hitler got a lot of stuff from, who got it from Plato.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:11.440]  Plato.
[01:03:12.301 --> 01:03:12.901]  Not Plato.
[01:03:13.001 --> 01:03:13.341]  Plato.
[01:03:16.883 --> 01:03:21.166]  But you have to understand, the globalists have bet that you're going to lay down.
[01:03:22.747 --> 01:03:24.848]  And they've got to be stopped themselves because
[01:03:27.247 --> 01:03:42.675]  They're the most unhappy, wicked, out of control people who think humanity is obsolete because they deep down hate themselves and they are projecting, they are projecting that onto us.
[01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:50.999]  Now we can talk about some of the things they could pull
[01:03:52.523 --> 01:03:54.824]  To get nationalism back under their control.
[01:03:55.004 --> 01:03:58.186]  Economic world collapse, they're already trying that, admitting that's their plan.
[01:04:00.567 --> 01:04:01.728]  Race war, they're already doing that.
[01:04:02.128 --> 01:04:19.578]  Attacking leaders like Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, anybody else that's willing to walk the line for the Republic, walk the line for our nations, walk the line for real renaissance and real open free societies.
[01:04:21.926 --> 01:04:26.468]  And they're going to organize the political systems into a bullying machine to bully you.
[01:04:27.645 --> 01:04:28.946]  And their social credit score.
[01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:34.189]  And systems to not just censor you but punish you because you don't submit to them.
[01:04:34.209 --> 01:04:41.074]  But what everyone has to understand is the current fake leftist Marxist order is only what they use to overthrow things.
[01:04:41.935 --> 01:04:57.245]  What comes in after it is far worse and the people that are being agitated to act as the cannon fodder for this need to understand with 100% certainty that they're useful idiots and that they are going to be the number one enemy of the globalists if their operation succeeds.
[01:04:58.205 --> 01:04:58.726]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:10.975]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:05:11.155 --> 01:05:12.416]  Believe me, I know.
[01:05:12.636 --> 01:05:16.920]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:22.404]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:05:22.624 --> 01:05:26.347]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back
[01:05:26.527 --> 01:05:42.875]  To fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:47.118]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:50.799]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.562]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:05:56.062 --> 01:05:58.764]  Unleash the super male in you.
[01:05:58.804 --> 01:06:01.866]  Super Male Vitality from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:14.153 --> 01:06:18.055]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:06:18.515 --> 01:06:22.438]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:43.671]  It's Friday, December 14th, 2018.
[01:06:43.711 --> 01:06:48.872]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:06:49.652 --> 01:06:50.232]  to 3 p.m.
[01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:52.192]  Central.
[01:06:52.252 --> 01:06:55.613]  Then we've got The War Room with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone.
[01:06:55.793 --> 01:06:56.873]  Don't forget David Knight.
[01:06:58.374 --> 01:06:59.654]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:06:59.674 --> 01:07:00.474]  with The David Knight Show.
[01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.590]  Well, Donald Trump was proven right again.
[01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:11.352]  He said, if you vote for the Democrats in the midterms, which we really didn't do, but they stole enough of the elections to get the House, that's clear.
[01:07:11.532 --> 01:07:12.572]  They got caught all over the country.
[01:07:13.232 --> 01:07:21.154]  He said, if they get into office, they're announcing more regulations, and the Federal Reserve's going to see me as weak, and they're going to raise interest rates some more, and that's going to kill the recovery.
[01:07:22.814 --> 01:07:27.335]  And the Democrats are siding with China in the trade war to screw us over.
[01:07:29.415 --> 01:07:31.776]  Just as Ross Perot warned us so many years ago.
[01:07:34.963 --> 01:07:45.808]  And so now, to add insult to injury, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down another 400 points amid rising fears over global warming.
[01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:50.330]  And the Federal Reserve has announced that they are going to raise interest rates more.
[01:07:53.192 --> 01:07:55.733]  And the Dow is down 419 points.
[01:07:55.813 --> 01:07:59.155]  Oh, but the Fed said they won't raise it as much as they were before.
[01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.156]  Well, the damage has already been done.
[01:08:02.476 --> 01:08:04.137]  So I want to get to Pelosi saying that
[01:08:06.325 --> 01:08:14.270]  She'll shut the government down forever before we build a wall to stop all the human smuggling of MS-13.
[01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.811]  After all, she called them God's children.
[01:08:17.632 --> 01:08:19.093]  Because it's her program.
[01:08:19.173 --> 01:08:21.975]  It's the same as in Europe, flooding them with military-age men.
[01:08:22.235 --> 01:08:24.797]  They're bringing in the outside group loyal to them.
[01:08:25.177 --> 01:08:32.642]  The Democrats have lawyers that skim the money off of the drug gangs and off of the mules and off of the people human trafficking.
[01:08:33.762 --> 01:08:38.464]  I read the Texas News, folks, and I see it every few months in a Texas town.
[01:08:38.524 --> 01:08:53.151]  They bust the police chief, or the mayor, or the mayor's brother, or a city councilwoman, and it's only when the people they're smuggling get found dead in the back of an 18-wheeler or dead in their basement.
[01:08:55.752 --> 01:09:03.136]  Yeah, well, it was the mayor's brother a few years ago in Austin got caught with half beaten to death, families chained up in his Austin basement.
[01:09:04.244 --> 01:09:05.284]  That's the family business!
[01:09:07.345 --> 01:09:22.930]  And what they do is, once they get these people in here, they don't have any papers, they don't have anybody to protect them, they're all scared to talk to anybody, and so, you have, whether it's Asian gangs, or whether it is Hispanic gangs, or Nigerian gangs,
[01:09:23.851 --> 01:09:32.915]  They get the people in here, or Muslim gangs, they get the people in, and then they are an underclass they control for human trafficking, everything else.
[01:09:32.955 --> 01:09:35.096]  So it's, it's so blood-sucking.
[01:09:36.276 --> 01:09:39.297]  You know, the big thing they do is, they'll have a factory.
[01:09:40.298 --> 01:09:41.058]  This is what the Muslims do.
[01:09:41.078 --> 01:09:42.258]  There's a lot of famous cases of this.
[01:09:43.539 --> 01:09:45.900]  They'll have a factory, a dairy, a
[01:09:47.633 --> 01:09:50.434]  A place that processes leather.
[01:09:50.454 --> 01:09:51.375]  I mean, there's a lot of these.
[01:09:51.735 --> 01:09:54.396]  And they'll bring in the people on their work visas.
[01:09:55.436 --> 01:09:56.116]  They control them.
[01:09:56.336 --> 01:09:57.397]  The Imam watches them.
[01:09:57.777 --> 01:09:58.557]  They work in the factory.
[01:09:58.877 --> 01:10:00.638]  And then they're all told, get on welfare.
[01:10:01.138 --> 01:10:07.400]  And that welfare is given back to the Imam and back to the Democrats that then run people for political office and they skim the money.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.481]  And this is what they left in the third world.
[01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:10.481]  They're totally used to this.
[01:10:11.001 --> 01:10:11.762]  So we need
[01:10:12.728 --> 01:10:14.429]  The Justice Department to bust these folks.
[01:10:14.549 --> 01:10:18.970]  And by the way, it has exploded under Trump, but it hardly gets any coverage.
[01:10:21.091 --> 01:10:21.971]  You know something else?
[01:10:21.991 --> 01:10:23.631]  This is a history lesson here.
[01:10:24.292 --> 01:10:27.253]  We forget that Trump got rid of the exemption on property taxes.
[01:10:29.313 --> 01:10:30.934]  On million dollars and more.
[01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:35.695]  Why do you think real estate is so expensive in blue cities and blue states?
[01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:40.037]  Why is real estate 10 times, 20 times
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.060]  What it is, say, in Dallas, Texas.
[01:10:45.701 --> 01:10:50.463]  Because they allow an exemption for property tax off of income tax.
[01:10:51.644 --> 01:10:56.565]  So people launder their money through the high property tax.
[01:10:56.665 --> 01:11:00.107]  It never goes back out on the real tax rolls to the federal government.
[01:11:00.407 --> 01:11:04.528]  It goes to Democrat-controlled cities who then use that massive war chest.
[01:11:04.808 --> 01:11:09.350]  I mean, on average, Democrat-controlled cities around this country have property taxes
[01:11:11.428 --> 01:11:15.211]  I mean, Austin has the highest property taxes in the state, by a long shot.
[01:11:15.311 --> 01:11:16.091]  And they're Democrats.
[01:11:19.493 --> 01:11:20.694]  And that's how they run their scam.
[01:11:20.714 --> 01:11:22.636]  But oh, they all have a tax exemption.
[01:11:22.656 --> 01:11:29.140]  They all have a charity that their house is in, and the helicopter's in, and the Mercedes is in.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:32.702]  These Democrats don't pay a dime, ever.
[01:11:34.043 --> 01:11:36.525]  They've got Mexicans chained up in the basement.
[01:11:37.185 --> 01:11:37.826]  That's what they've got.
[01:11:39.226 --> 01:11:40.947]  How many times have you seen the U.N.
[01:11:41.247 --> 01:11:45.089]  with diplomatic immunity and they find a couple trunks with dead women in them?
[01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:58.016]  How many times has a woman run crying out in Manhattan with blood pouring down her back and her teeth knocked out and they deliver the woman back to the U.N.
[01:11:58.156 --> 01:11:58.536]  official?
[01:12:00.277 --> 01:12:03.359]  I've probably seen articles like that in 23 years on air, maybe 800, 1,000 times.
[01:12:09.565 --> 01:12:11.006]  But it's always just a little footnote.
[01:12:11.246 --> 01:12:18.208]  And I talk to cops in DC and in New York and in Houston, there's a lot of embassies.
[01:12:19.269 --> 01:12:20.129]  They call them consulates.
[01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:24.030]  It's not the main national one.
[01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:25.871]  And they go, oh yeah, routinely.
[01:12:27.171 --> 01:12:27.712]  Routinely.
[01:12:27.932 --> 01:12:34.154]  There's this Chinese delegates are driving around with whole trunks full of cocaine.
[01:12:35.325 --> 01:12:42.892]  And they'll be drunk driving and run over somebody and the cops get there and they just jump out and flash the diplomatic immunity and the police can't do a thing.
[01:12:43.152 --> 01:12:45.494]  See, that's what globalism is.
[01:12:49.857 --> 01:12:52.640]  A global superclass above the law.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:56.563]  The UN, all over the world, owns the diplomatically immune aircraft.
[01:12:56.964 --> 01:13:00.847]  They have paramilitary forces and in every country they operate.
[01:13:02.776 --> 01:13:05.619]  They smuggle children and women.
[01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:14.729]  And when they get caught, when the woman escapes, in Saudi Arabia or wherever, it doesn't even make the news.
[01:13:17.852 --> 01:13:18.653]  Now do you understand?
[01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:23.639]  The UN and this whole collection and leftists in every country run the same scams.
[01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:33.340]  They've brought in 15 million people, most of them military-aged men, the last six, seven years to Europe, and 90-plus percent are still on welfare.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:38.203]  They're not allowed to get jobs, and they just pay a skim to the local socialist.
[01:13:39.865 --> 01:13:41.185]  That's why they're so hard to beat.
[01:13:41.365 --> 01:13:45.508]  They've got the money, and they're criminal, and they'll do anything.
[01:13:49.311 --> 01:13:52.053]  So Trump, even though it hurt his businesses and his properties,
[01:13:53.004 --> 01:13:56.625]  Trump's lost $2 billion, it's reported, just since he got in office and ran.
[01:13:58.966 --> 01:14:07.908]  But Trump took away most of his exemptions on income tax because he wanted to burn the Democrats and the Blue Staters.
[01:14:09.729 --> 01:14:10.689]  And he's costing them.
[01:14:11.970 --> 01:14:14.310]  It's record taxes coming in, and it's because of that.
[01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:19.972]  In fact, some numbers are it's over $50 billion since he got that repealed.
[01:14:21.641 --> 01:14:26.722]  50 billion dollars that Democrat blue state people have had to pay.
[01:14:28.603 --> 01:14:29.383]  I love it.
[01:14:30.263 --> 01:14:31.024]  I love it.
[01:14:36.245 --> 01:14:36.845]  It's beautiful.
[01:14:38.485 --> 01:14:39.566]  Trump is vengeance.
[01:14:40.346 --> 01:14:48.008]  That's why they hate him so bad and say he's so ineffective and he's such an idiot and everyone then repeats it and thinks they're smart and they say Trump's an idiot, even so-called conservatives.
[01:14:49.434 --> 01:14:54.835]  Trump's done incredible things with almost no one around him that will actually work with him.
[01:14:56.975 --> 01:15:04.597]  So my support of Trump is not just some ass-kissing contest because all I get is hate and lawsuits and demonization for standing with President Trump.
[01:15:04.857 --> 01:15:08.237]  But I do it because he's standing with his word and doing the best job he can.
[01:15:08.317 --> 01:15:13.658]  But the bad news is, we'll come back and play all the clips, is that he's surrounded by such traitors.
[01:15:13.698 --> 01:15:18.059]  He's been given a multi-thousand page NAFTA agreement, renegotiation NAFTA-GATT agreement,
[01:15:19.517 --> 01:15:20.698]  That has Law of the Sea, U.N.
[01:15:20.738 --> 01:15:21.238]  crap in it.
[01:15:22.459 --> 01:15:26.703]  It has the end of free speech codified in it, the end of Section 230.
[01:15:29.565 --> 01:15:30.145]  It's really bad.
[01:15:30.646 --> 01:15:32.327]  And it'll be stripped out in ratification.
[01:15:33.048 --> 01:15:37.832]  But that's why the left wants control of the Congress, because they want to just ram all this stuff through.
[01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:45.633]  And Trump's dropped the ball on fighting vaccines, but the point is, is he's not Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:46.214 --> 01:15:48.016]  And that's why they want to take him out.
[01:15:48.056 --> 01:15:57.746]  All right, we're going to play the clips when we come back of the situation at the border, and a little clip about how Ross Perot was right on the other side about the giant sucking sound.
[01:15:57.786 --> 01:15:58.247]  Stay with us.
[01:15:58.307 --> 01:15:59.068]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:00.762 --> 01:16:01.582]  Look, we all do it.
[01:16:02.203 --> 01:16:03.503]  A lot of times we don't have a choice.
[01:16:03.523 --> 01:16:11.347]  You go on a trip, you book into a big globalist hotel that funds groups trying to take our guns and teach our five-year-old boys how to wear dresses.
[01:16:11.807 --> 01:16:12.227]  It's a fact.
[01:16:12.247 --> 01:16:16.389]  These corporations are out to conquer humanity, not to break up our families.
[01:16:17.089 --> 01:16:20.651]  And sometimes I can't find an item in another online shop, I go to Amazon.
[01:16:21.271 --> 01:16:23.352]  But I consciously try to not do it.
[01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:33.412]  In fact, when I use a product, or I hear about folks that like a product, I tend to get the product and then sell it at a huge discount at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:16:34.212 --> 01:16:42.301]  There aren't many places where you can go where you're going to find items lower than Amazon, because they have created a total monopoly.
[01:16:42.521 --> 01:16:45.605]  They get like $1.48 on every shipment from the federal government.
[01:16:45.905 --> 01:16:46.586]  We don't do that.
[01:16:47.947 --> 01:16:52.009]  But we still bring you deals so good that in many cases it's better than Amazon.
[01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:59.172]  So you're funding the second American Revolution, you're sticking it in the eye of the globalists, and you're getting great products all at the same time.
[01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.674]  It's called a 360 win.
[01:17:01.694 --> 01:17:11.118]  I talk about that a lot, but you're not getting a 360 win when you go to Target or Walmart and buy a toy that breaks when you get it out of the box.
[01:17:11.959 --> 01:17:12.739]  And I'm not judging you.
[01:17:13.199 --> 01:17:14.460]  I was at the mall a week ago.
[01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:20.153]  19-month-old daughter saw this little robot car.
[01:17:21.094 --> 01:17:21.755]  She wanted it.
[01:17:22.375 --> 01:17:23.416]  I bought it from the woman.
[01:17:24.217 --> 01:17:27.100]  It was broken when I got home and didn't work.
[01:17:28.841 --> 01:17:30.963]  Well, we're not selling products like that.
[01:17:31.003 --> 01:17:39.111]  Whether it's the water filtration, the air filtration, the supplements, the books, the videos, the patron apparel, it's all the very best at the lowest prices.
[01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:42.394]  So, we have the 12 Days of Christmas, the biggest sale in our history.
[01:17:43.308 --> 01:17:44.989]  We're selling on inventory ahead of the end of the year.
[01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:50.994]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% is the lowest discount, up to 75%.
[01:17:51.594 --> 01:17:53.255]  We're losing money on a lot of these.
[01:17:53.675 --> 01:17:54.876]  So we have the 12 days of Christmas.
[01:17:55.177 --> 01:17:58.019]  One item every day was particularly discounted up to 75%.
[01:17:58.119 --> 01:18:06.745]  We're bringing all of those sales back up until the 19th, when you're still guaranteed to get delivered to the continental United States before Christmas.
[01:18:08.405 --> 01:18:13.680]  Biggest sale in our history, extended, and now all the super sales!
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.360]  That we're already there.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:19.421]  The very best sales the last 12 days are all brought back right now.
[01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:23.843]  While not fighting traffic and not fighting all the stupid crowds at the big box stores.
[01:18:24.123 --> 01:18:27.384]  And not giving your money to Jeff Bezos that literally wants to gang rape this country.
[01:18:27.944 --> 01:18:32.825]  These specials were such massive lost leaders that we can only promote them for 24 hours.
[01:18:33.145 --> 01:18:38.507]  But now we're bringing back all of our InfoWars Christmas Mega Specials at InfoWarsStore.com for a limited time.
[01:18:38.807 --> 01:18:41.307]  And many are already completely selling out.
[01:18:41.907 --> 01:18:43.128]  So everything we had

[01:18:48.152 --> 01:18:53.776]  Most products are still there, but a lot are going to be selling out, including best-selling t-shirts, so take advantage of this right now.
[01:18:54.537 --> 01:19:03.825]  I have made the decision to completely sell out our entire 2018 inventory at some of the lowest prices ever to avoid paying ridiculous amounts of government inventory tax.

[01:19:56.432 --> 01:19:57.874]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:20:04.981 --> 01:20:16.549]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.854 --> 01:20:28.018]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:28.538 --> 01:20:30.860]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.079 --> 01:20:33.180]  So it's really simple.
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:37.542]  There's a big private corporate world government with diplomatic immunity above the law.
[01:20:37.902 --> 01:20:39.823]  They can rape and kill women and children.
[01:20:40.183 --> 01:20:41.944]  They can ship drugs anywhere they want.
[01:20:42.825 --> 01:20:45.406]  They can even kill police officers inside people's countries.
[01:20:45.986 --> 01:20:47.467]  They have just total control.
[01:20:49.028 --> 01:20:50.949]  In third world nations, the UN runs.
[01:20:51.509 --> 01:20:53.010]  Now they want control here.
[01:20:54.252 --> 01:21:01.217]  Remember, David Rockefeller's father had the plan for the UN to trick nations into a private corporate global government.
[01:21:01.917 --> 01:21:03.078]  So they donated the land.
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:13.785]  They can basically come into the nations and do whatever they want once they've removed that national sovereignty.
[01:21:17.065 --> 01:21:24.349]  And so they have the Democratic Party, the leftist parties, and all the countries clamoring for no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:40.857]  Once the wages are driven down in the First World Nation, it doesn't really drive them up the Third World Nation, then the Third World is migrated into the First World and you have one giant underclass you control.
[01:21:41.097 --> 01:21:44.339]  And I know the listeners understand this, but this is the global fight.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:22:08.293]  And so Macron and Merkel and others, despite the fact that it's incredibly unpopular, despite the fact that it destroys the nations and bankrupts the pension funds, they bring in the most ignorant, the most unwashed, the most easily influenceable groups of people to literally be the political muscle.
[01:22:10.267 --> 01:22:14.068]  But remember, you can see the French now burning down key targets.
[01:22:14.308 --> 01:22:16.688]  It has the same effect as the leftists.
[01:22:18.209 --> 01:22:25.130]  But the nationalists, the right-wing, the Christians, the conservatives, and that's what makes up the white knights of this whole thing.
[01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:26.970]  That's what makes up the yellow vest.
[01:22:28.491 --> 01:22:35.212]  They're targeting globalists, and globalist shops, and globalist companies, and leftist groups, and leftist government.
[01:22:37.233 --> 01:22:38.093]  And that's the checkmate.
[01:22:38.494 --> 01:22:43.356]  Oh, you can bring in the Muslims and have them burn down our neighborhoods if we don't do what you want?
[01:22:43.556 --> 01:22:45.177]  How about we burn you down?
[01:22:46.298 --> 01:22:48.759]  And top French generals have written letters saying you're guilty of treason.
[01:22:49.099 --> 01:22:52.521]  Do not continue signing on to the UN Compact to open our borders further.
[01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:55.503]  This is part of a larger globalist plan and we are done.
[01:22:56.043 --> 01:22:59.305]  You are in danger of being arrested and the public has a right to revolt.
[01:23:01.857 --> 01:23:03.398]  Some of those are current top generals.
[01:23:03.498 --> 01:23:05.118]  That's how far this has gone.
[01:23:05.138 --> 01:23:06.479]  But that's what globalism is.
[01:23:06.539 --> 01:23:08.020]  Globalism is treason.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:12.982]  Against your nation, against common sense, against everything.
[01:23:15.803 --> 01:23:17.504]  It's how you're conquered in the 21st century.
[01:23:17.824 --> 01:23:24.067]  And Ross Perot was 100% right back in the debates in 1992.
[01:23:24.807 --> 01:23:25.647]  Ross Perot was right.
[01:23:26.508 --> 01:23:28.829]  Well, I think the question was... It'll only take a minute to kill us.
[01:23:28.869 --> 01:23:29.409]  Go ahead.
[01:23:30.753 --> 01:23:31.814]  Go ahead, kill it.
[01:23:32.534 --> 01:23:34.415]  You're talking about the question, not me, right?
[01:23:34.795 --> 01:23:34.975]  No.
[01:23:35.155 --> 01:23:37.637]  Do you guys ever do anything but propaganda?
[01:23:37.737 --> 01:23:38.837]  Isn't it your business also?
[01:23:38.877 --> 01:23:40.738]  Would you even know the truth if you saw it?
[01:23:40.878 --> 01:23:42.039]  Oh, yes, I... I don't believe you would.
[01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:47.041]  A lot of us remember the debate between Al Gore, who was then Vice President, and Ross Perot.
[01:23:47.102 --> 01:23:49.603]  Ross Perot was fiercely against NAFTA.
[01:23:49.703 --> 01:23:53.725]  Knowing what we know now, was Ross Perot right?
[01:23:59.921 --> 01:24:10.044]  All I can remember from that is a bunch of charts.
[01:24:10.064 --> 01:24:12.304]  So, President Bush, I think you said it earlier.
[01:24:12.324 --> 01:24:13.865]  A new world order.
[01:24:14.725 --> 01:24:15.205]  Let's go.
[01:24:15.925 --> 01:24:18.286]  And I think the first question is over here.
[01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:22.673]  Yes, I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perreault.
[01:24:23.714 --> 01:24:36.608]  What will you do as president to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business and to stop unfair competition here at home from foreign countries so that we can bring jobs back to the United States?
[01:24:38.191 --> 01:24:40.333]  That's right at the top of my agenda.
[01:24:40.513 --> 01:25:00.048]  We've shipped millions of jobs overseas, and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where, after you've served for a while, you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts, and then go back out.
[01:25:00.869 --> 01:25:02.751]  To those of you in the audience who are business people,
[01:25:03.902 --> 01:25:04.502]  Pretty simple.
[01:25:04.902 --> 01:25:16.487]  If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young 25- let's assume you've been in business for a long time, you've got a mature workforce.
[01:25:17.148 --> 01:25:27.632]  Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care, that's the most expensive single element in making a car, have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement,
[01:25:29.221 --> 01:25:34.528]  And you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.
[01:25:35.089 --> 01:25:43.000]  So, if the people send me to Washington, the first thing I'll do is study that 2,000-page agreement and make sure it's a two-way street.
[01:25:44.341 --> 01:25:45.562]  I, one last point here.
[01:25:45.622 --> 01:25:52.407]  I've called, I've decided I was dumb and didn't understand it, so I called the who's who of the folks who've been around it, and I said, why won't everybody go south?
[01:25:52.427 --> 01:25:53.448]  They said, we'll be disruptive.
[01:25:53.508 --> 01:25:54.309]  I said, for how long?
[01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:58.392]  I finally got them up for 12, 15 years, and I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?
[01:25:58.712 --> 01:26:07.679]  And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, then it's leveled again, but in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.
[01:26:08.499 --> 01:26:09.280]  We've got to cut it out.
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:11.101]  Now you've inherited our problems!
[01:26:11.242 --> 01:26:12.122]  We didn't listen!
[01:26:13.982 --> 01:26:22.788]  And here we are, 25, 26, 27, 28 years later, 28 years later, 28 years later.
[01:26:22.888 --> 01:26:23.089]  Wow.
[01:26:24.029 --> 01:26:26.991]  And it all came true, just like Ross Perot said, because it was a plan.
[01:26:27.352 --> 01:26:28.432]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:26:28.493 --> 01:26:29.653]  It's in the globalist statements.
[01:26:29.914 --> 01:26:32.055]  It's in CFR reports written 50 years ago.
[01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:35.097]  They wanted to get rid of the first world.
[01:26:35.838 --> 01:26:39.060]  Civilization is about having high wages and quality.
[01:26:40.001 --> 01:26:42.823]  Civilization is about building an infrastructure for people.
[01:26:44.482 --> 01:26:49.105]  But by setting it up where we did one-sided deals with the third world, we didn't help them.
[01:26:49.405 --> 01:26:57.149]  We only helped transfer our industry and jobs to those countries so the globalists could then have the first world sue for peace.
[01:26:59.411 --> 01:27:02.472]  Once we'd been turned into a... Remember what it was going to be back then?
[01:27:02.753 --> 01:27:07.155]  We're going to be a service economy in Europe and the US and Canada and Australia.
[01:27:07.475 --> 01:27:09.036]  And now you like that service economy?
[01:27:10.677 --> 01:27:13.819]  Millennials are paid half of what their parents were paid.
[01:27:17.523 --> 01:27:20.504]  And the folks older than that were paid more than that generation.
[01:27:21.164 --> 01:27:22.665]  And now we have less savings?
[01:27:23.005 --> 01:27:24.205]  Oh, and what do the millennials want?
[01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:27.727]  They want socialism or communism, 50-plus percent.
[01:27:28.947 --> 01:27:35.470]  They've been brainwashed now, and actually, in the final phase, see, as we collapse, they think having everything free will fix it.
[01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:36.950]  No, it'll turn you into Venezuela.
[01:27:37.871 --> 01:27:41.492]  So we're not just becoming poor, we're becoming mentally ignorant.
[01:27:42.779 --> 01:27:43.399]  And Pelosi?
[01:27:44.239 --> 01:27:51.081]  Well, she says if you even want the physical wall to stop the collapse of the third world, why, transferring all our jobs down there was supposed to fix it.
[01:27:52.162 --> 01:27:55.863]  She says if you even want that, you can't have it, and she'll shut the government down forever.
[01:27:56.083 --> 01:27:58.744]  Well, good lady, because you're shutting the country down forever.
[01:27:58.904 --> 01:27:59.404]  Here she is.
[01:28:00.299 --> 01:28:05.661]  Do you think he changes his calibration even if you're able to pass a bill under your watch on the 3rd of January?
[01:28:06.181 --> 01:28:08.041]  His position ostensibly wouldn't change.
[01:28:08.061 --> 01:28:11.042]  Why would he sign that bill to open government up in January?
[01:28:11.062 --> 01:28:14.763]  Does he want to have government closed forever?
[01:28:14.783 --> 01:28:17.144]  I mean, what's this about?
[01:28:17.744 --> 01:28:19.385]  I know he doesn't believe in government.
[01:28:19.485 --> 01:28:23.606]  I know he doesn't know that much about what is at risk to shut it down.
[01:28:24.486 --> 01:28:29.168]  But I think that it would be... Let's not talk about what might happen.
[01:28:30.336 --> 01:28:32.357]  Let's not talk about what might happen.
[01:28:34.017 --> 01:28:34.537]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:34.578 --> 01:28:48.362]  Let's not look at how the Democrats and Republicans both signed up as lobbyists with foreign firms to pass the laws to then go join the firms to be paid millions of dollars a year, in many cases, to be traitors.
[01:28:49.243 --> 01:28:49.603]  That was it.
[01:28:49.683 --> 01:28:50.003]  Period.
[01:28:50.683 --> 01:28:54.845]  They used our open society, the globalists did, to come in here and sell out everything.
[01:28:55.765 --> 01:28:58.426]  And half the public hates the president for trying to fix it.
[01:29:01.186 --> 01:29:01.680]  We're good.
[01:29:08.982 --> 01:29:09.302]  Boom!
[01:29:09.442 --> 01:29:11.104]  This is right at the end of the election.
[01:29:11.984 --> 01:29:14.766]  Gary Franci's Next News Net is now number one.
[01:29:14.966 --> 01:29:16.868]  And that's tumblrlabs.com.
[01:29:17.148 --> 01:29:20.190]  Number one ahead of the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:22.752]  It was number two, Young Turks number three, Fox News number four.
[01:29:22.832 --> 01:29:24.173]  CNN is down at seven.
[01:29:24.273 --> 01:29:26.054]  That's why they had to get me banned.
[01:29:26.095 --> 01:29:27.435]  It's why they've shadow banned you.
[01:29:27.596 --> 01:29:28.536]  Because they're pathetic.
[01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:30.498]  So these guys can't compete with us.
[01:29:30.518 --> 01:29:32.139]  They're really monsters, Gary.
[01:29:32.159 --> 01:29:33.220]  And now the system's betting
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:40.121]  That by blocking us on all these platforms, blocking you, dialing you back, that somehow they're going to win, but that isn't happening, is it?
[01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:51.764]  When you look at the social media elements and you see what just happened, the new email threads that have been released regarding the actual discussion of censorship of conservatives, it's terrifying.
[01:29:51.964 --> 01:30:01.566]  If you take a look at the social media statistics around that time of the election, your channel, my channel, Mark Dice's channel, alternative and independent news channels, conservative news,
[01:30:02.126 --> 01:30:02.346]  I don't
[01:30:25.309 --> 01:30:26.070]  I don't
[01:30:47.051 --> 01:30:55.479]  Let's be clear, you put in Gary Franchi or you put in Tucker Carlson or Alex Jones, and it's been in the emails, our names, it sends you to Trevor Noah.
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:56.841]  It sends you to Stephen Colbert.
[01:30:56.881 --> 01:30:58.943]  It sends you to CNN.
[01:30:59.003 --> 01:31:08.232]  They literally, on Google, on YouTube, send our people in the top 50 pages only to their crap to give them a boost.
[01:31:08.332 --> 01:31:10.154]  But the boost didn't work, now it's gone.
[01:31:10.234 --> 01:31:10.855]  It's incredible.
[01:31:12.168 --> 01:31:16.750]  Yeah, we're seeing an uptick as of late, which is encouraging.
[01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:22.973]  I think we're going to hit a million subscribers, God willing, in the next 60 to 90 days.
[01:31:23.453 --> 01:31:26.095]  And we're blessed to have that.
[01:31:26.675 --> 01:31:29.916]  But, you know, like you, you know that can be taken away at any moment.
[01:31:29.976 --> 01:31:36.500]  I go to sleep every night and I think to myself, I'm going to wake up in the morning with an email saying, sorry, you know, we're shutting you down.
[01:31:37.975 --> 01:31:45.418]  I mean, we've connected with some high hitters, some heavy hitters in the multi-channel space who help us and support us, you know, as advocates.
[01:31:46.279 --> 01:31:52.422]  But at the end of the day, you know, you have a platform you've built for so many years and you can still continue to push forward.
[01:31:53.722 --> 01:31:56.025]  And I thank you for that, you're an inspiration for so many.
[01:31:56.465 --> 01:32:02.813]  But the reality is, is that they are manipulating the truth, they're manipulating the algorithms, and we have to push forward.
[01:32:03.193 --> 01:32:08.179]  Like, even though we have hundreds of thousands of subscribers, a lot of those people don't even get notifications.
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:09.981]  Stay hungry.
[01:32:10.021 --> 01:32:11.062]  They've got to know it's a war.
[01:32:11.142 --> 01:32:14.586]  It's up to the viewers and listeners who are awesome to take action exactly as you said.
[01:32:14.706 --> 01:32:23.236]  We have to use the big globalist platformers, build our own platforms, and then all work together synergistically to defeat the censorship of these draconian activities.
[01:32:23.756 --> 01:32:27.441]  So at Twitter for now, at Gary Franchi, also at Next News Network.
[01:32:27.801 --> 01:32:30.044]  How else can people find the great work you're doing daily?
[01:32:31.013 --> 01:32:32.754]  Well, I mean, they can go to YouTube.
[01:32:32.835 --> 01:32:36.518]  It's youtube.com slash nextnewsnetwork and they can find us there.
[01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:39.420]  You know, we put out about 15 reports a day.
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:43.443]  We cover a lot of the stuff that we see all over the conservative news.
[01:32:43.483 --> 01:32:45.024]  And you're doing a great job.
[01:32:45.205 --> 01:32:46.446]  Gary, come down in Austin.
[01:32:46.486 --> 01:32:47.246]  I'll fly you down here.
[01:32:47.266 --> 01:32:47.827]  Be in studio.
[01:32:47.847 --> 01:32:49.048]  Say hi to your wife and kids for me.
[01:32:49.308 --> 01:32:51.890]  You've been doing a great job for 15 plus years and we love you.
[01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.490]  God bless you.
[01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:53.011]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:33:05.177 --> 01:33:07.899]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.224 --> 01:33:23.287]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.283 --> 01:33:34.264]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:34.284 --> 01:33:36.887]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday Worldwide Edition.
[01:33:36.927 --> 01:33:37.989]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:38.970 --> 01:33:43.655]  The band websites are newswars.com, infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[01:33:43.675 --> 01:33:45.698]  I want to give the phone number out.
[01:33:47.068 --> 01:33:53.810]  And take your calls on a raft of issues, but I'd like specifically to be on these topics, because I want to get your take on this.
[01:33:54.550 --> 01:34:00.172]  Are you upset with the private Federal Reserve openly raising interest rates, when they didn't on Obama, to kill the economy?
[01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:04.293]  And Democrats running around celebrating, trying to drive it down, and that's not even an issue.
[01:34:04.333 --> 01:34:05.914]  We should make that a big political issue.
[01:34:06.214 --> 01:34:07.014]  The President was right.
[01:34:07.434 --> 01:34:08.615]  This is economic sabotage.
[01:34:08.915 --> 01:34:11.336]  At the very same multinational banks that own our Federal Reserve,
[01:34:12.896 --> 01:34:15.477]  Just like the EU controls England even though they never voted to enter it?
[01:34:15.637 --> 01:34:16.597]  This is just asinine.
[01:34:17.097 --> 01:34:27.279]  These very same people are threatening Spain and Italy and all these other nations that if you try to pull out of the Euro or you don't keep your borders open, we're going to implode your economy.
[01:34:28.519 --> 01:34:33.300]  Well how about the militaries of those countries arrest the agents of those companies in their countries?
[01:34:34.681 --> 01:34:38.102]  How about we stop putting up with the white shoe boys pulling this crap?
[01:34:38.362 --> 01:34:39.722]  You know, that's what Russia did.
[01:34:41.348 --> 01:34:44.371]  Russia just arrested all the Rothschild Rockefeller agents.
[01:34:45.152 --> 01:34:51.960]  And then the Rothschilds sued, what was it, six, seven years ago, a bunch of newspapers saying, we're not really running the oligarchs.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:58.647]  And the judge in some of the cases, the Rothschilds lost all the cases, said it's incredible.
[01:34:58.867 --> 01:35:02.712]  This defamation libel suit proves you were doing this to Russia.
[01:35:05.506 --> 01:35:07.147]  Why do we put up with this crap?
[01:35:07.988 --> 01:35:23.197]  Why do we put up with Macron saying we're gonna have 200 million more people brought in from overseas, and that France is no longer France, and the nation doesn't exist, and then our media says Trump's evil, he says America exists, and that he said the word nationalist.
[01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:31.902]  I mean, you talk about jumping the shark, ladies and gentlemen, it's really, really insane.
[01:35:33.993 --> 01:35:34.933]  So I want to talk about that.
[01:35:34.973 --> 01:35:39.594]  I want to talk about Pelosi saying we'll just shut the government down forever to keep the border open.
[01:35:42.635 --> 01:35:44.416]  And Sarah Sanders made a great point.
[01:35:45.056 --> 01:35:48.437]  Democrats haven't decided they love our country more than they hate the president.
[01:35:49.057 --> 01:35:52.418]  Because that's what they're doing is trying to literally drive the country into the ground.
[01:35:52.438 --> 01:35:53.838]  Well, they've already decided, Sarah.
[01:35:56.308 --> 01:35:58.570]  The Democratic Party says America was never great.
[01:35:58.930 --> 01:35:59.731]  It'll never be great.
[01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:00.731]  They're globalists.
[01:36:00.851 --> 01:36:02.292]  They hate the country.
[01:36:02.773 --> 01:36:11.499]  They're a criminal cabal that loots from their dumbest constituent up to the top criminal kingpins that don't pay taxes.
[01:36:11.739 --> 01:36:12.420]  We all know it.
[01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:21.907]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are drooling over going after Trump on campaign finance when it's not a campaign.
[01:36:23.496 --> 01:36:25.918]  Contribution to a campaign when it's his private money?
[01:36:26.598 --> 01:36:30.881]  To give money to an old fling?
[01:36:30.901 --> 01:36:40.448]  But they're saying, well, any money he spent during a campaign, you know, because it was during a campaign, that was to make him look good for the campaign, so that's a campaign contribution.
[01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:46.893]  You know, the last five years, they were down to one vote on the Federal Elections Commission.
[01:36:48.311 --> 01:36:57.138]  And the head Democrat on it wanted Infowars shut down, and she said, just type it in, a head Democrat on federal election submission says shut down Alex Jones Infowars.
[01:36:57.359 --> 01:37:00.141]  They had hearings three years ago, two years ago.
[01:37:00.661 --> 01:37:06.506]  She's off the committee now, but they had the majority of the Democrats voting, but the Republicans had one more vote.
[01:37:07.607 --> 01:37:11.550]  And they were saying, we're going to shut down Alex Jones, we're going to shut down Matt Drudge.
[01:37:12.451 --> 01:37:17.075]  Because everything they do is Republican, and so it's an in-kind donation.
[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:20.180]  Total bull!
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:23.581]  But that's how they're extending all this crap out.
[01:37:23.601 --> 01:37:29.162]  And then they've got Cohen up there saying, the president told me to cover this up.
[01:37:29.702 --> 01:37:30.923]  Cohen, you tried to record him.
[01:37:30.943 --> 01:37:32.903]  You were probably already busted for this stuff years ago.
[01:37:33.443 --> 01:37:34.023]  That's pretty clear.
[01:37:35.684 --> 01:37:38.064]  And he said, yeah, we're gonna make the payment.
[01:37:38.084 --> 01:37:38.905]  And Trump's like, no, you're not.
[01:37:39.965 --> 01:37:40.125]  What?
[01:37:42.332 --> 01:37:43.492]  These people are rats.
[01:37:44.092 --> 01:37:49.974]  Imagine being a rat like Cohen, and he's just always trying to set Trump up for years, so he could get some leverage over him.
[01:37:50.254 --> 01:37:51.054]  But he could never do it.
[01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:54.955]  Because Cohen knew he was committing a whole bunch of crimes.
[01:37:55.755 --> 01:38:04.017]  And now this admitted, convicted criminal, who pled guilty to all these crimes, he's now telling us the presence of that guy.
[01:38:04.037 --> 01:38:05.698]  But just, you know, don't forget, where's the Russia?
[01:38:05.758 --> 01:38:06.338]  Where's the Russia?
[01:38:07.739 --> 01:38:08.319]  Where's the Russia?
[01:38:08.339 --> 01:38:09.920]  It doesn't exist.
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:13.921]  And right now the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down over 400 points.
[01:38:15.502 --> 01:38:16.663]  And that makes the Democrats happy.
[01:38:16.683 --> 01:38:17.803]  Because they want you poor.
[01:38:18.183 --> 01:38:19.264]  They want you on welfare.
[01:38:19.704 --> 01:38:21.024]  They want you not working.
[01:38:21.064 --> 01:38:22.225]  They want you destitute.
[01:38:22.625 --> 01:38:25.906]  Because they want to break you and control every facet of your life.
[01:38:26.286 --> 01:38:28.667]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:38:28.687 --> 01:38:28.727]  877-789-2539.
[01:38:28.747 --> 01:38:28.948]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:38:39.787 --> 01:38:45.532]  And that's the number for you to be able to join us, and I'd love to hear from you on air.
[01:38:45.552 --> 01:38:45.772]  877-789-2539.
[01:38:46.633 --> 01:38:51.557]  Now remember, I'm not up here covering all this really negative, bad stuff, because I want to demoralize you.
[01:38:52.357 --> 01:38:58.863]  They want us off the air because they know it's exposing what they're doing, and that they won't be able to get away with it.
[01:39:00.064 --> 01:39:00.564]  It's that simple.
[01:39:01.145 --> 01:39:02.826]  And, you know, I'm not a litigious person.
[01:39:02.846 --> 01:39:03.627]  I don't like lawsuits.
[01:39:05.299 --> 01:39:16.868]  I've learned that when we point out how business scams work that nobody else is doing, when we point out how global scams work, we point out how they're taking your blood at birth and giving it to big tech labs who then patent your own proteins.
[01:39:17.108 --> 01:39:19.530]  So when you need gene therapy later, they tell you they own it.
[01:39:21.791 --> 01:39:24.593]  Our research helped lead to lawsuits that are stopping that.
[01:39:24.814 --> 01:39:25.854]  Just talking about it.
[01:39:26.675 --> 01:39:28.576]  And people go researching and go, wow, that's really true.
[01:39:28.857 --> 01:39:30.158]  No one ever had that angle on it.
[01:39:30.498 --> 01:39:31.719]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:37.318]  With how the Democrats make the money off of being immigration lawyers.
[01:39:37.678 --> 01:39:40.539]  And how they then have mafias and skim money off these people.
[01:39:41.079 --> 01:39:47.100]  But particularly Hispanics won't go to the police because they're more corrupt in the third world than anything else the police are.
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:49.341]  And so they're the perfect group to be preyed on.
[01:39:49.361 --> 01:39:52.221]  And then meanwhile the Democrats act like they're their advocates.
[01:39:52.781 --> 01:39:53.762]  Very, very sick.
[01:39:54.362 --> 01:39:54.942]  Very, very evil.
[01:39:54.982 --> 01:39:56.302]  So that's what we're doing.
[01:39:56.322 --> 01:39:59.683]  We're covering all these things because so much of what we do then
[01:40:02.014 --> 01:40:06.077]  Begins the debate, begins the discussion about things that no one else is talking about.
[01:40:06.458 --> 01:40:08.239]  That's what InfoWars is important.
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:10.081]  That's why you're important.
[01:40:10.101 --> 01:40:16.546]  That's why your support of us isn't just critical, it's absolutely imperative.
[01:40:20.529 --> 01:40:31.398]  Right now, George Soros, Hillary, the Democrats are harassing and seeking out any type of merchant account we have so that you can't even go to InfoWarsTore.com
[01:40:32.924 --> 01:40:35.866]  And use a credit card, a debit card, a digital check, any of that.
[01:40:35.907 --> 01:40:38.829]  They want to block you from your right to commerce.
[01:40:41.751 --> 01:40:44.954]  But they can't do it right now because we have merchant accounts.
[01:40:44.994 --> 01:40:48.156]  But I'm selling everything out so we don't have to pay inventory tax.
[01:40:49.337 --> 01:40:52.180]  And so that we're funded a few months into the next year regardless.
[01:40:53.737 --> 01:40:54.919]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.785]  Infowarslife.com is where you go.
[01:40:57.985 --> 01:40:59.788]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.
[01:41:00.089 --> 01:41:04.277]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the sub-URL of the great supplements that are so popular.
[01:41:05.862 --> 01:41:09.643]  We're bringing back all of the unprecedented 12 Days of Christmas specials.
[01:41:10.083 --> 01:41:12.164]  The 12 Days of Christmas was going to end tomorrow.
[01:41:12.444 --> 01:41:14.365]  That's when we started it, 12 days ago, or 11 days ago.
[01:41:14.965 --> 01:41:19.507]  But I've decided, now some things are about to sell out, we're going to bring all the specials back.
[01:41:19.767 --> 01:41:26.289]  We always have 50 to 75% off storewide, but particularly we'd have a best-selling item at 60% off.
[01:41:26.849 --> 01:41:35.172]  All of those specials have been brought back, on top of all the other specials, and the free t-shirt with every order, and the free shipping, and the double Patriot points on your next order.
[01:41:37.117 --> 01:41:39.579]  10% on each dollars and a 5%, you can't beat it.
[01:41:40.839 --> 01:41:43.961]  We're bringing back all of the unprecedented Christmas specials for a limited time.
[01:41:44.381 --> 01:41:51.145]  Over the past 12 days at InfoWarsTore.com, we've launched some of the biggest specials ever to help you stock up on Christmas and support the InfoWar.
[01:41:51.585 --> 01:41:55.768]  These specials were such massive loss leaders that we could only promote them for 24 hours.
[01:41:57.469 --> 01:42:03.252]  But now we're bringing all of our Christmas mega specials back at InfoWarsTore.com for a limited time only.
[01:42:04.266 --> 01:42:06.227]  And many are already completely selling out.
[01:42:06.727 --> 01:42:11.548]  I have made the decision to completely sell all of our 2018 inventory at some of the lowest prices ever.
[01:42:11.628 --> 01:42:16.449]  These are the lowest we've ever done, by leaps and bounds, to avoid paying ridiculous amounts of government inventory tax.
[01:42:16.469 --> 01:42:25.911]  This is your last chance to take advantage of these Christmas super specials, including Rainforce Plus, 55% off, free shipping, and a free t-shirt, and double Patriot points.
[01:42:27.172 --> 01:42:31.793]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% of Humidoids, Unbelievable for Inflammation, you name it.
[01:42:33.723 --> 01:42:34.444]  50, 60% off.
[01:42:34.984 --> 01:42:37.907]  Last run of Super Mel Vitality and Super Female Vitality, 55% off.
[01:42:38.247 --> 01:42:41.349]  Ultimate Bone Broth, 55% off, despite the fact it's a bestseller.
[01:42:41.749 --> 01:42:46.733]  Super Blue, all Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and iodine, 60% off.
[01:42:46.793 --> 01:42:50.896]  The adults, the children, the immune gargle, the mouthwash, all 60% off.
[01:42:51.257 --> 01:42:52.497]  Alpha Power, 60% off.
[01:42:52.698 --> 01:42:54.259]  All of it, store-wide free shipping.
[01:42:54.719 --> 01:42:56.000]  All of it, double Patriot points.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:57.521]  All of it, free t-shirt.
[01:42:58.122 --> 01:42:59.162]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:42:59.383 --> 01:42:59.663]  Thank you.
[01:43:01.704 --> 01:43:12.446]  In the last few months, you have seen Infowars offer the biggest sales in our history because Soros and the Globalists are all over the news trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut down our shopping carts, trying to destroy us.
[01:43:13.046 --> 01:43:16.447]  They have kicked us off almost every media outlet out there because we're loyal Americans.
[01:43:16.487 --> 01:43:28.629]  But thanks to you supporting us, we're on more radio stations and more TV stations than ever because these stations understand that Trump and myself and many others are being persecuted by the Globalists, by the Leftists, by the Hollywood scum.
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.201]  But InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:43:31.261 --> 01:43:38.966]  So this Christmas, only a few days until Christmas left, I want to just thank all the viewers and listeners for your support, for your prayers, and for being in this together.
[01:43:39.126 --> 01:43:48.433]  And just to remind you again, please share the articles, please share the videos from NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com because those get around the censors easier than InfoWars.com.
[01:43:48.713 --> 01:43:54.236]  But whatever you do, realize this country and this planet is in a fight for its life against the globalists and
[01:43:55.337 --> 01:44:08.109]  It is financing that allows us to do what we do, and that's why it is a total win for everybody, because you get great products at InfoWareStore.com, and at the same time, you help fund this operation that is fearlessly fighting the globalists as hard as we can.
[01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:12.653]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[01:44:13.173 --> 01:44:21.801]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas.
[01:44:22.321 --> 01:44:23.262]  We're good to go!
[01:44:49.821 --> 01:44:51.542]  And thank you again, all, for your support.
[01:44:51.863 --> 01:44:54.044]  We're extending this sale until the 19th.
[01:44:54.585 --> 01:44:59.168]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com, and we're going to beat the globalists together.
[01:44:59.228 --> 01:44:59.548]  Thank you.
[01:45:01.290 --> 01:45:07.754]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:45:09.456 --> 01:45:10.897]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:45:11.137 --> 01:45:16.061]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50% to 75% off double Patriot points.
[01:45:17.228 --> 01:45:23.157]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:45:23.918 --> 01:45:30.027]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free colloidal silver iodine fortified super blue that we make like three bucks on at this sale.
[01:45:30.407 --> 01:45:31.589]  You'll get a free gift
[01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:58.528]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next order so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[01:45:59.764 --> 01:46:06.086]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:08.287]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[01:46:08.347 --> 01:46:13.288]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:14.289]  It's big.
[01:46:14.769 --> 01:46:15.169]  It's bad.
[01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:20.771]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[01:46:20.811 --> 01:46:23.092]  You know, they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[01:46:23.532 --> 01:46:26.733]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[01:46:27.353 --> 01:46:28.296]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:46:28.336 --> 01:46:29.519]  That's been going on for over a month.
[01:46:30.281 --> 01:46:31.504]  50 to 75% off.
[01:46:31.524 --> 01:46:32.526]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[01:46:33.612 --> 01:46:34.532]  The Double Patriot points.
[01:46:34.573 --> 01:46:35.473]  That's what happened in about a week.
[01:46:35.833 --> 01:46:42.457]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[01:46:42.917 --> 01:46:47.299]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:47.319 --> 01:46:49.200]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.281]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:46:51.461 --> 01:46:53.523]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:53.683 --> 01:46:57.705]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[01:47:05.198 --> 01:47:07.959]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:08.919 --> 01:47:20.564]  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
[01:47:37.865 --> 01:48:06.675]  Without saying a word You can light up the dark Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don't say a thing The smile on your face lets me know that
[01:48:13.672 --> 01:48:14.993]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:15.013 --> 01:48:16.574]  We're going to be going to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:48:17.895 --> 01:48:30.485]  But I thought I would just point out that Congressman Ted Lieu went on national television a few days ago, we played it yesterday, and said he would love nothing more than to silence people's speech.
[01:48:31.786 --> 01:48:33.827]  But that it's up to private companies to do it.
[01:48:36.029 --> 01:48:38.551]  And in all of this is the crux to everything.
[01:48:40.432 --> 01:48:41.633]  Because under Section 230,
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.426]  The big tech giants have no right to censor anybody.
[01:48:49.449 --> 01:48:51.853]  Because they're given liability protection.
[01:48:56.294 --> 01:49:03.380]  Next hour, I'm going to play Tucker Carlson's report on that for a segment, and I'm going to play Mark Dice's report on that for a segment.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:11.206]  But first, we're going to take calls until the bottom of the next hour, and then Matt Bracken's going to be hosting on national security issues in the fourth hour.
[01:49:11.226 --> 01:49:12.147]  And I'll be back this Sunday.
[01:49:12.167 --> 01:49:13.768]  I'll be live 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:49:13.788 --> 01:49:17.211]  I'm also going to come up here tomorrow and do a live special broadcast.
[01:49:19.292 --> 01:49:23.055]  And I'm almost tempted that I may be the person that hosts a weeknight show.
[01:49:23.075 --> 01:49:24.817]  I think I may have to double down here.
[01:49:25.663 --> 01:49:30.127]  Because there's the discipline of live that makes it get done.
[01:49:31.508 --> 01:49:34.691]  And in that is really what it all comes down to.
[01:49:34.731 --> 01:49:37.833]  We have to fight hard in this historical moment we've entered.
[01:49:44.639 --> 01:49:49.864]  Because you hear him say, I'd love to censor, but we're the government.
[01:49:50.697 --> 01:49:52.738]  We can't do it, but companies can.
[01:49:53.179 --> 01:49:56.081]  These companies operate as utilities, under law.
[01:49:57.822 --> 01:50:05.627]  And I have all these Democrats come to me, and all these reporters, and they go, Alex, what should be changed?
[01:50:05.647 --> 01:50:06.408]  What should be done?
[01:50:06.748 --> 01:50:07.368]  When they're ignorant.
[01:50:08.249 --> 01:50:10.410]  And they go, you know, what should the law be?
[01:50:10.451 --> 01:50:11.932]  And it's like, we already have a law.
[01:50:13.453 --> 01:50:19.557]  If I have a message board on InfoWars.com, or NewsWars.com, or a comment section, which we have,
[01:50:21.331 --> 01:50:24.794]  I'm not liable when a third party comes on there and says they're gonna kill somebody.
[01:50:25.774 --> 01:50:27.996]  I've just got to respond to the subpoena if I get one.
[01:50:31.258 --> 01:50:34.521]  And we have moderators that would generally take that down because that's illegal.
[01:50:34.801 --> 01:50:40.045]  But I'm still not liable because they could post it and then I'd be that second guilty.
[01:50:43.308 --> 01:50:44.629]  So that's how they play these games.
[01:50:44.949 --> 01:50:46.109]  It's been set up in law.
[01:50:46.429 --> 01:50:48.410]  Section 230 has been adopted all over the world.
[01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.930]  The U.S.
[01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:50.091]  invented the Internet.
[01:50:50.491 --> 01:50:53.512]  We came up with a system to regulate it.
[01:50:53.872 --> 01:50:54.452]  It's worked.
[01:50:54.612 --> 01:50:55.333]  It made sense.
[01:50:55.673 --> 01:51:00.995]  And now, by fiat, these companies are simply getting rid of it.
[01:51:01.675 --> 01:51:04.856]  They're acting as publishers, and they're deciding what to keep up.
[01:51:04.896 --> 01:51:12.259]  But when Sundar Pichai of Google gets up in front of Congress, and he says, we do not
[01:51:14.088 --> 01:51:17.891]  Censor or block Republicans or Conservatives.
[01:51:18.672 --> 01:51:19.972]  We only do it to hate.
[01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:21.934]  Well, that's playing a game.
[01:51:23.355 --> 01:51:29.179]  Oh, we don't rape children, and they put a sticker on a child, but we do rape bobble bops.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.962]  It's really a children, but they just stuck a sticker on it calling it a bobble bop.
[01:51:33.463 --> 01:51:34.764]  You can use any stupid word you wanted.
[01:51:35.104 --> 01:51:37.646]  But the Southern Poverty Law Center, this trusted flagger,
[01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:45.650]  The ADL, the Trusted Flagger, the Media Matters, Soros' arm, I mean, he funds them all.
[01:51:47.492 --> 01:51:48.252]  Trusted Flagger.
[01:51:49.573 --> 01:51:52.196]  Those are groups funded by the Democratic Party, by U.S.
[01:51:52.236 --> 01:51:54.718]  taxpayers, by the State Department, USAID.
[01:51:55.858 --> 01:51:57.920]  Your tax money goes to George Soros.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:51:59.922]  He keeps a heapin' helpin' of it for himself.
[01:52:01.069 --> 01:52:04.430]  You don't think that criminal that pays no taxes is actually giving any of his money, do you?
[01:52:05.010 --> 01:52:18.075]  He swindles it all in, hands it all out to the different groups, and they fund the migrant caravans and the open borders and the groups teaching your five-year-old how to give a good you-know-what, how to wear a dress, your five-year-old son.
[01:52:18.676 --> 01:52:20.636]  They fund it all because he's an agent.
[01:52:20.936 --> 01:52:21.577]  It's his job.
[01:52:21.777 --> 01:52:23.577]  He helped fund the overthrow of the Soviet Union.
[01:52:23.857 --> 01:52:24.738]  But not to fix it.
[01:52:25.558 --> 01:52:28.460]  He helped set up the oligarchs to gang-rape the Russians!
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:29.880]  He's a gang-raper!
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:30.961]  That's what he does!
[01:52:31.241 --> 01:52:33.502]  He wants to rape your family financially, too!
[01:52:35.544 --> 01:52:44.048]  And have big, fat, ugly-looking pedophiles come in there and tell your five-year-old about sex and stuff Daddy and Mommy wouldn't even talk to him about, but don't worry, you got a new uncle!
[01:52:44.609 --> 01:52:45.929]  He's wearing a big purple wig!
[01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:49.571]  He's gonna tell ya... about your ding-a-ling.
[01:52:51.292 --> 01:52:53.934]  And people say, oh, that's really gross to say that on air, hey...
[01:52:55.612 --> 01:52:57.373]  This is what they're teaching everybody's kids, man!
[01:52:58.273 --> 01:53:06.016]  And we just put up with it, so there's a big, fat, green light, because men act passive to this type of crap.
[01:53:07.996 --> 01:53:09.637]  Well, I'm not acting passive to it anymore.
[01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:12.058]  It fundamentally makes me angry.
[01:53:13.398 --> 01:53:16.019]  But I'm putting that anger into action, and I'm asking you to do the same thing.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:21.341]  So when you see Congressman Lew, who we're about to play a clip of,
[01:53:23.857 --> 01:53:28.138]  I sat there in that committee hearing, 30 feet from him, watching him for hours.
[01:53:28.198 --> 01:53:29.078]  I couldn't keep my eyes.
[01:53:29.098 --> 01:53:32.699]  You know, Hank Johnson was there, and Congressman Deutch, and all these other weirdos.
[01:53:36.679 --> 01:53:37.839]  And Sheila Jackson Lee.
[01:53:37.879 --> 01:53:40.840]  I mean, it was like a gallery of weirdos.
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:46.141]  He kept talking under his breath, repeating what he was going to say when his statement came up.
[01:53:46.181 --> 01:53:47.461]  And I watched him do the statement.
[01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:49.222]  And you just talk about a robot.
[01:53:50.322 --> 01:53:51.702]  So when you hear what he says, he's been
[01:53:54.526 --> 01:54:04.429]  Google executives on record donate money to him and Nadler and others and they give them the press release, the talking points that they read back on the question so Sundar can look so smart.
[01:54:04.610 --> 01:54:05.930]  They're all engaged in the perjury together.
[01:54:06.370 --> 01:54:12.012]  And he gets up there and talks about hate speech and Alex Jones and I've got to be banned and another congresswoman got up and said that.
[01:54:12.392 --> 01:54:15.453]  Oh, we've seen Alex Jones here today spreading his conspiracy theories.
[01:54:17.394 --> 01:54:17.534]  Yeah.
[01:54:22.096 --> 01:54:32.740]  And then he goes on national television and he says, I'd love to shut these right-wingers up to something called the First Amendment, but it's the job of the companies.
[01:54:33.741 --> 01:54:37.002]  So he says, it's the job of the companies to shut us up.
[01:54:38.322 --> 01:54:39.763]  Well, I mean, digitally now.
[01:54:41.636 --> 01:54:44.958]  You try to type in a cuss word in your iPhone or Droid, it won't let you send it.
[01:54:45.318 --> 01:54:46.279]  Well, they're already saying that.
[01:54:46.339 --> 01:54:59.166]  Well, now words like mother and father and she or he, those in certain sentences on iPhones and on Google searches, you're not going to be able to type them in.
[01:54:59.987 --> 01:55:00.667]  Wow!
[01:55:01.107 --> 01:55:02.428]  That was announced last week.
[01:55:04.329 --> 01:55:05.730]  Now you're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:55:06.817 --> 01:55:12.099]  What did I say a few months ago when people all over the world couldn't send emojis of the Taiwanese flag, period?
[01:55:12.119 --> 01:55:16.440]  Because China told Apple, we don't say that flag exists.
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:18.841]  And they said, yes sir, boss.
[01:55:20.661 --> 01:55:22.542]  And for a month, you couldn't send that emoji.
[01:55:22.742 --> 01:55:23.782]  There was a backlash to it.
[01:55:25.063 --> 01:55:25.943]  But they keep doing it.
[01:55:25.963 --> 01:55:28.064]  They think someday you'll just give up, which people are doing.
[01:55:29.073 --> 01:55:30.234]  And that's this game of attrition.
[01:55:30.454 --> 01:55:30.774]  Push it.
[01:55:31.014 --> 01:55:31.334]  Push it.
[01:55:31.574 --> 01:55:31.894]  Push it.
[01:55:32.114 --> 01:55:32.415]  Push it.
[01:55:32.655 --> 01:55:32.935]  Do it.
[01:55:33.195 --> 01:55:33.475]  Do it.
[01:55:33.735 --> 01:55:33.995]  Do it.
[01:55:34.215 --> 01:55:34.415]  Do it.
[01:55:34.495 --> 01:55:39.077]  Until people are so sick of being censored, they just finally just give up on the platforms altogether.
[01:55:40.958 --> 01:55:42.759]  So it's about who wants it most.
[01:55:42.879 --> 01:55:43.319]  You know what?
[01:55:43.379 --> 01:55:44.500]  You try to wear me out?
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:45.720]  That just makes me stronger.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:46.941]  That's like what weightlifting is.
[01:55:47.981 --> 01:55:57.606]  But see, there's this passive spirit of malaise that comes over people, and they don't have that animating spirit of liberty, and it's like they're dead inside.
[01:55:58.234 --> 01:55:58.895]  And that's okay.
[01:55:59.115 --> 01:56:02.278]  Let the dead bury the dead, as Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, said.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.121]  But you're not dead.
[01:56:05.742 --> 01:56:06.723]  And that's why they hate you.
[01:56:07.043 --> 01:56:08.645]  Because I'm not that powerful.
[01:56:10.727 --> 01:56:19.837]  But this broadcast and this platform, like a photon tube, that focuses a bunch of light into it, all of us together,
[01:56:21.288 --> 01:56:26.372]  This isn't some thousand points of light, that's an Illuminati term, but they take everything that's real and they create a counterfeit.
[01:56:26.652 --> 01:56:39.863]  But the billions of points of light, God's spirit shining through us together, coming together with a broadcast like this, that's what they fear because that's like a particle beam of truth that can fire out!
[01:56:42.725 --> 01:56:43.626]  And that's what they're scared of.
[01:56:43.646 --> 01:56:44.467]  So we're gonna go to break.
[01:56:45.167 --> 01:56:45.928]  Come back to your calls.
[01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:50.532]  But since I mentioned it, let's go out to break with Mr. Liu.
[01:56:50.572 --> 01:56:50.852]  Here it is.
[01:56:51.988 --> 01:56:55.730]  I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech.
[01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:58.672]  The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.
[01:56:59.212 --> 01:57:01.594]  And that's simply a function of the First Amendment.
[01:57:01.634 --> 01:57:06.897]  But I think over the long run, it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech.
[01:57:07.317 --> 01:57:12.060]  I would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves.
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:15.502]  But it's really nothing that I believe government can do.
[01:57:15.902 --> 01:57:17.583]  And so that's been my position all along.
[01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:21.291]  So they've sold this idea, and the Heritage Foundation has done it too.
[01:57:21.331 --> 01:57:26.432]  Well, if it's Google, bigger than most governments, and it's got more data than the NSA, then it's okay.
[01:57:27.712 --> 01:57:35.474]  But it's a political group, the Democrats, the globalists, Soros, who are actually running Google and deciding what can go up and what can't go up and what comes down.
[01:57:36.754 --> 01:57:37.455]  So incredible.
[01:57:38.075 --> 01:57:40.695]  And the Republicans are just now figuring out what's happened.
[01:57:41.336 --> 01:57:44.676]  They better figure it out real quick, or it's game over.
[01:57:45.897 --> 01:57:46.877]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:46.897 --> 01:57:47.297]  Stay with me.
[01:57:55.452 --> 01:58:04.157]  I've been on air 23 plus years, and I've learned a lot about sales, because that's how we finance our operation to defend the Republic and our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and our way of life.
[01:58:04.957 --> 01:58:09.540]  I was never classically trained, but over the last 23 years, I've learned about the different systems of sales.
[01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:15.523]  Now there's lots of philosophies about having something really, really expensive, and a certain percentage will buy it, believing it's the best.
[01:58:16.303 --> 01:58:17.164]  That's not what I do.
[01:58:18.004 --> 01:58:24.307]  I try to find the very best products that are popular, get the best deal on it, so I can sell the most of it.
[01:58:24.367 --> 01:58:25.567]  That seems to be like common sense.
[01:58:25.687 --> 01:58:33.810]  Whatever people like the best, whatever I like the best, whatever's the best value, then I'll sell it for the lowest price, but then I'll dominate the market and be the biggest seller of it.
[01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:35.011]  And I am an infomercial.
[01:58:35.311 --> 01:58:41.253]  The biggest distributor of Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration Gravity Fetch Systems because they're the very best.
[01:58:41.373 --> 01:58:46.414]  They can give us the best deals to sell them to you at the lowest price and so we are the biggest distributor.
[01:58:46.434 --> 01:58:54.897]  Now year of end came and they gave us the biggest deal ever of $127 on that water filtration system because they didn't want to have to pay inventory at the end of the year.
[01:58:55.057 --> 01:58:56.257]  We sold out of it.
[01:58:56.638 --> 01:58:57.418]  They didn't think we could do it.
[01:58:58.058 --> 01:58:58.638]  You responded.
[01:58:58.658 --> 01:58:59.659]  You went and did your own research.
[01:58:59.919 --> 01:59:01.040]  Knew it was an incredible deal.
[01:59:01.521 --> 01:59:06.224]  They also make the Alexa Pure Breeze Air Filtration four-stage ion filter.
[01:59:06.284 --> 01:59:11.087]  When they came to me five years ago and said, we've developed a great ion filter.
[01:59:11.107 --> 01:59:12.628]  Many competitors are $500, $600, $800, $1,000.
[01:59:12.749 --> 01:59:14.530]  This is just as good or better than most of them.
[01:59:14.630 --> 01:59:16.131]  We're going to sell it for $300.
[01:59:16.331 --> 01:59:16.892]  I said, great.
[01:59:17.532 --> 01:59:17.852]  Absolutely.
[01:59:17.892 --> 01:59:18.933]  I just bought filters for
[01:59:18.973 --> 01:59:19.273]  We're good.
[01:59:55.341 --> 01:59:59.726]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:07.373 --> 02:00:11.259]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:11.399 --> 02:00:19.269]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:41.982]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:42.002 --> 02:00:43.143]  About to go to your phone calls.
[02:00:43.883 --> 02:00:45.184]  Appreciate you all holding here.
[02:00:47.666 --> 02:00:49.147]  Who should we start with first here?
[02:00:49.187 --> 02:00:54.291]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:00:54.351 --> 02:00:55.972]  Let's go to Walt in New York.
[02:00:56.032 --> 02:00:57.393]  Walt, thanks for holding here on the air.
[02:00:57.433 --> 02:00:57.794]  Go ahead.
[02:00:58.714 --> 02:00:59.195]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:59.235 --> 02:00:59.795]  How are you doing?
[02:01:00.055 --> 02:01:00.876]  I'm doing pretty good.
[02:01:00.936 --> 02:01:05.600]  I mean, you know, you got the French military, top generals saying Macron should be arrested for treason.
[02:01:06.531 --> 02:01:07.392]  Which is what's happening.
[02:01:07.412 --> 02:01:08.973]  So, I mean, people are starting to wake up.
[02:01:09.033 --> 02:01:10.494]  It's just people always wake up so late.
[02:01:11.074 --> 02:01:12.836]  How bad is this going to get before we turn it around?
[02:01:13.836 --> 02:01:16.638]  Well, we've got electronics going for us today, Alex.
[02:01:16.678 --> 02:01:18.500]  We're talking maybe to a million people, right?
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:20.421]  I would say probably more than that, yeah.
[02:01:21.262 --> 02:01:28.707]  You know, way back in 1913, when the Federal Reserve came in, very few voices really understood what it was.
[02:01:28.767 --> 02:01:34.091]  But the people who were behind it knew it held the ultimate political power to be able to
[02:01:35.163 --> 02:01:36.045]  I think so.
[02:01:43.937 --> 02:01:47.658]  And Charles Lindbergh Jr., who we know in the spirit of St.
[02:01:47.718 --> 02:01:53.760]  Louis flew across the Atlantic, his father was a congressman at the time who fought valiantly against it.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:54.980]  This is a quote.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.542]  He said, this Federal Reserve Act establishes the most gigantic trust on Earth.
[02:01:59.982 --> 02:02:06.464]  When President Woodrow Wilson signs this bill, the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized.
[02:02:06.904 --> 02:02:12.866]  The worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.
[02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:14.551]  So we got two things.
[02:02:14.591 --> 02:02:20.060]  We got this electronic power, which the founders didn't understand, but is vast.
[02:02:20.541 --> 02:02:21.523]  And if we lose this...
[02:02:22.273 --> 02:02:23.694]  We will lose the battle.
[02:02:23.734 --> 02:02:33.840]  We have to keep the First Amendment as it applies to electronics alive and well and apply antitrust to these big tech corporations.
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:35.641]  They have to be put in their place.
[02:02:35.701 --> 02:02:41.685]  We the people have to preserve that First Amendment because if we lose the power to speak, then we'll lose it all.
[02:02:41.945 --> 02:02:43.886]  But we also have to get a handle on this
[02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:48.010]  Well, let's be clear, because you're an awesome call, Walt.
[02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:49.770]  You're making great points.
[02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:51.411]  Your phone's crystal clear.
[02:02:51.431 --> 02:02:51.851]  I love you.
[02:03:11.983 --> 02:03:14.365]  China's had 10% growth rates for 20, 30 years.
[02:03:14.525 --> 02:03:15.266]  Oh, that's all fine.
[02:03:15.286 --> 02:03:16.727]  We start getting a 4.5.
[02:03:16.827 --> 02:03:18.068]  Oh my gosh, it's overheating.
[02:03:18.749 --> 02:03:22.792]  Because again, exactly, they want to kill the American dream.
[02:03:22.812 --> 02:03:23.572]  That's their plan.
[02:03:24.033 --> 02:03:24.994]  That's their program.
[02:03:25.154 --> 02:03:32.540]  And expanding on the Federal Reserve and what it's done, and then now how they spin this whole thing that, oh, it's above the law.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:33.460]  We can't do anything about it.
[02:03:33.521 --> 02:03:35.362]  And, oh, big tech, it's private companies.
[02:03:35.782 --> 02:03:41.107]  It'd be the same thing if they broke in on your phone call if you were saying something that the company didn't like.
[02:03:41.627 --> 02:03:52.109]  And they said, let's say, Ma Bell, 30 years ago, before it got broken up, or when it got broken up, imagine if Ma Bell said, well, we're a private company, so we can control what you say in private conversations.
[02:03:52.169 --> 02:03:53.250]  No, that's prior restraint.
[02:03:53.690 --> 02:03:57.351]  And we have the law, Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act.
[02:03:57.951 --> 02:04:05.432]  So, they're violating the damn law, playing dumb like the public doesn't know, so it's up to us to inform Congress that we do know.
[02:04:05.452 --> 02:04:06.813]  Because that's what's really scary.
[02:04:06.833 --> 02:04:08.153]  The Republicans know what's going on here.
[02:04:09.605 --> 02:04:21.131]  Well, maybe the people in the Congress could, you know, dig down deep inside their soul and discover a little patriotism and try to do something for the country and something for the future of humanity.
[02:04:21.431 --> 02:04:26.454]  Maybe they could try to enact legislation, beginning in the House, that would
[02:04:27.354 --> 02:04:31.117]  Uh, break up these big companies or limit their ability to control content.
[02:04:31.577 --> 02:04:37.581]  And maybe we could do something about the currency too and give that power back to the people under their representatives.
[02:04:37.981 --> 02:04:39.442]  How can they have all this power?
[02:04:39.802 --> 02:04:41.423]  Why have we surrendered these powers?
[02:04:41.844 --> 02:04:44.966]  The people need to wake up and assert themselves.
[02:04:45.286 --> 02:04:47.027]  What can we do to wake the people up, Alex?
[02:04:47.327 --> 02:04:53.015]  What you're doing right now, brother, and what you just said is absolutely 100% over the target.
[02:04:53.035 --> 02:05:00.324]  It's horrifying how they got control of our banking and our currency in 1913, and now with big tech, it's our communications, and they go, oh, it's okay, it's private!
[02:05:02.492 --> 02:05:08.478]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:05:08.878 --> 02:05:11.481]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:05:12.082 --> 02:05:15.525]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:05:15.785 --> 02:05:20.050]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:05:20.490 --> 02:05:23.733]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:24.634 --> 02:05:34.877]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:35.637 --> 02:05:44.180]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:54.352]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:04.571]  We've got it.
[02:06:04.731 --> 02:06:10.494]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:10.554 --> 02:06:14.696]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:14.936 --> 02:06:20.699]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:21.299 --> 02:06:21.919]  Again!
[02:06:29.713 --> 02:06:33.315]  To the audience and to the crew, I'm a little bit of a jerk or bummed out sometimes.
[02:06:33.435 --> 02:06:34.256]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:06:34.336 --> 02:06:35.217]  I'm not whining.
[02:06:35.237 --> 02:06:36.297]  I just want you to know the byproduct.
[02:06:36.958 --> 02:06:40.820]  I get really pissed being informed and knowing what's going on.
[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:54.649]  Like, do you think I get gleefully happy every day when I come in here and some prominent person dies or almost dies from taking a vaccine and it's even admitted that the vaccine did it and then they just try to push more vaccines?
[02:06:58.413 --> 02:06:59.293]  No, I get upset.
[02:06:59.353 --> 02:07:02.095]  I'm like, how much of this do we have to take?
[02:07:06.597 --> 02:07:15.421]  I don't get excited when the mainstream news comes out, Politico, and goes, okay, there are giant no-go zones all over Europe, and none of the Muslims have jobs, and everything's collapsing.
[02:07:16.282 --> 02:07:19.203]  I just say, God Almighty, why couldn't we have stopped this earlier?
[02:07:19.703 --> 02:07:23.925]  The Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, hospitalized after pneumonia vaccine goes wrong.
[02:07:24.405 --> 02:07:25.266]  Almost died.
[02:07:36.995 --> 02:07:37.675]  Oh my goodness.
[02:07:39.095 --> 02:07:39.876]  It just never ends.
[02:07:41.416 --> 02:07:42.716]  Meanwhile, there's some good news though.
[02:07:44.356 --> 02:08:03.480]  Republicans announced last week, but it's finally hitting the news today, that they're going to go ahead with hearings in this lame duck session of Congress, better late than never, with whistleblowers testifying live on television about the paper play and the criminal activities in the billions by the Clintons.
[02:08:05.916 --> 02:08:06.436]  Fox News.
[02:08:06.477 --> 02:08:11.241]  Republicans examine accusations of pay-to-play at Clinton Foundation amid plunge in donations.
[02:08:11.741 --> 02:08:14.043]  It's plunged over 90% since they're out of office.
[02:08:16.806 --> 02:08:19.949]  Meanwhile, Yellow Vest bringing Central London to a standstill.
[02:08:21.450 --> 02:08:32.300]  Unity News Network reports big demonstrations with the Yellow Vest blocking roads to protest the fake Brexit deal handed over total sovereignty of England to the
[02:08:34.292 --> 02:08:35.152]  EU dictatorship.
[02:08:35.232 --> 02:08:36.913]  So that stuff is spreading.
[02:08:37.273 --> 02:08:39.514]  Very, very exciting to see that happening.
[02:08:39.875 --> 02:08:48.298]  And France is set to see the fifth weekend of demonstrations as well as they were going to have the no confidence vote on Macron today, but they actually didn't have it.
[02:08:49.779 --> 02:08:53.981]  Same on Theresa May, but they're saying both those guys are very close being removed from office.
[02:08:54.021 --> 02:08:55.462]  So we're on the march.
[02:08:55.962 --> 02:08:57.042]  The empire's on the run.
[02:08:57.423 --> 02:09:01.885]  Globalism, as soon as we defined it, unelected corporations running our countries.
[02:09:03.157 --> 02:09:04.757]  Who say they want us poor to control us?
[02:09:06.258 --> 02:09:10.258]  Man, that's like selling people gasoline in the middle of a fire.
[02:09:10.538 --> 02:09:11.679]  Dump gasoline on your head.
[02:09:12.039 --> 02:09:16.179]  I'd rather sell snow cones to, you know, folks in the Sahara.
[02:09:16.899 --> 02:09:18.580]  That's what freedom is versus socialism.
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:21.060]  So we're in a really crazy place right now.
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:21.980]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:09:23.001 --> 02:09:24.041]  Wildman!
[02:09:24.561 --> 02:09:25.761]  Wildman!
[02:09:26.321 --> 02:09:27.601]  In the state of Texas.
[02:09:27.641 --> 02:09:28.121]  You're on the air.
[02:09:28.181 --> 02:09:28.682]  Thanks for holding.
[02:09:29.462 --> 02:09:30.642]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:09:30.742 --> 02:09:31.262]  Glad to take...
[02:09:31.914 --> 02:09:32.954]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:09:32.974 --> 02:09:33.534]  Thanks for calling.
[02:09:33.634 --> 02:09:35.655]  I haven't talked to you in a while.
[02:09:35.715 --> 02:09:37.555]  Last time I called in, it's been a couple of years.
[02:09:37.675 --> 02:09:43.596]  Josh Plumlee was on, was talking about the trafficking, the traffic across the border, training ISIS over there and all that.
[02:09:43.616 --> 02:09:55.958]  But I called you, I found you due to research of my late wife's illness and finding out about vaccines and all the stuff.
[02:09:55.978 --> 02:09:56.838]  This was back in 2013.
[02:09:57.578 --> 02:10:00.719]  She passed away from ALS is what they named it.
[02:10:01.562 --> 02:10:13.406]  And in my research, I found out, you know, she, her dad had, uh, he was in Vietnam and he ended up passing away from like nine strokes that he had.
[02:10:14.306 --> 02:10:19.048]  And she was, she had four sisters and she was the only one that went over there to Vietnam with him.
[02:10:19.168 --> 02:10:21.589]  And she had to take the same, uh,
[02:10:22.509 --> 02:10:23.129]  Well, let's explain.
[02:10:23.169 --> 02:10:27.812]  They don't want a bunch of battle-hardened soldiers back in the country who are patriots.
[02:10:27.872 --> 02:10:30.834]  So you use them in a war, but after a war, what do you do?
[02:10:30.854 --> 02:10:32.655]  You spike a cannon.
[02:10:32.815 --> 02:10:35.476]  You pull the engine out of the helicopter when you put it at the park.
[02:10:50.828 --> 02:10:55.673]  You want to use the cannon, the artillery, or the tank, or the helicopter to get kids to join.
[02:10:55.693 --> 02:10:58.236]  This is the technocrats on top.
[02:10:58.977 --> 02:11:02.560]  But you don't want that tank, or that helicopter, or that howitzer to actually work.
[02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:13.231]  And so yes, and I know so many soldiers, so many people that have been in every branch of the service, as you name it, from the lowest level cooks to the most secret, you know, teams.
[02:11:14.423 --> 02:11:18.012]  And it's well known that some officers were like, we're not taking this and I'm not either.
[02:11:18.032 --> 02:11:18.533]  Throw it away.
[02:11:18.553 --> 02:11:20.538]  We're going to lie and put in the forms we did.
[02:11:22.011 --> 02:11:29.353]  To those that would make them do it, but they would routinely in formations, and this has come out in the news, have people die.
[02:11:29.994 --> 02:11:33.655]  Like a platoon gets shots and one person dies, ten are in the hospital.
[02:11:34.155 --> 02:11:38.457]  Because they aren't just getting the regular vaccines, they're getting tested on.
[02:11:39.017 --> 02:11:43.038]  And so yeah, you join the military, it's not that our military is bad, it's not that America's bad.
[02:11:43.338 --> 02:11:50.881]  The criminals have used the secrecy of our military, they've used the stoicism of our military as a place to test on people, and you're absolutely right.
[02:11:51.861 --> 02:11:59.106]  A lot of the children and families of service people end up getting those military shots.
[02:11:59.906 --> 02:12:05.090]  And, you know, your wife got to live, I guess, a while, you know, 40 years or so.
[02:12:05.110 --> 02:12:08.192]  A lot of people get killed right on the spot.
[02:12:08.792 --> 02:12:11.354]  And again, it's all about how to cover it up.
[02:12:11.634 --> 02:12:12.595]  It's all a big test.
[02:12:13.235 --> 02:12:15.677]  And again, the average person in the military is not involved.
[02:12:16.017 --> 02:12:18.779]  This is all a giant technocracy program.
[02:12:20.794 --> 02:12:23.837]  And she, you know, I took care of her here in the house until she passed away.
[02:12:24.137 --> 02:12:25.057]  I wouldn't put her in a home.
[02:12:25.538 --> 02:12:29.401]  And finding out all this, I found out Lyme disease, you know, was created on that island.
[02:12:29.921 --> 02:12:31.022]  Palm Island?
[02:12:31.042 --> 02:12:33.644]  Yes, Palm Island.
[02:12:33.704 --> 02:12:36.427]  It's tick-carried, weaponized shifters.
[02:12:36.467 --> 02:12:37.427]  Exactly.
[02:12:37.467 --> 02:12:40.870]  The ticks come over on the fowl that was on the deer that they were pissing that on.
[02:12:41.250 --> 02:12:42.411]  And it came over here and spread.
[02:12:42.732 --> 02:12:45.073]  And this is how I found all this out.
[02:12:45.434 --> 02:12:47.335]  And then I found you researching all this.
[02:12:47.355 --> 02:12:47.716]  And then,
[02:12:49.915 --> 02:12:56.720]  You know, you're talking about your last caller talking about, you know, jobs going overseas, and you're talking about it all the time, and then Trump trying to get it all back.
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:57.881]  I was part of that.
[02:12:57.941 --> 02:13:02.044]  I got laid off in 1981 from a steel mill in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:13:02.084 --> 02:13:02.965]  See, that's nice steel.
[02:13:03.365 --> 02:13:15.374]  There was 7,000 men working in that steel mill when I was there, and they laid off 2,500 of us for the first whack when they started shutting all this steel mills down due to foreign steel.
[02:13:15.974 --> 02:13:19.297]  And then, as a result of that, we started getting this crappy steel over here.
[02:13:20.157 --> 02:13:27.879]  And it was, uh, the rails for the railroad was crumbling apart and stuff, so they decided to open that part of the mill back up and leave it going.
[02:13:28.519 --> 02:13:34.080]  But you get flat iron and all that kind of stuff come in with steel forks and knives and this flat sheet metal.
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:37.301]  Absolutely, it's all a big giant scam.
[02:13:37.381 --> 02:13:39.161]  China and all of them just sell us pure crap.
[02:13:39.421 --> 02:13:48.043]  Just like China executes you and even have opiates, because that's how the British East India Company took control of China, was shipping those drugs in.
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:56.706]  But they ship all this synthetic heroin over here in massive amounts, literally as a chemical weapon against us.
[02:13:57.147 --> 02:13:58.948]  But you know, you lost your wife.
[02:13:59.228 --> 02:13:59.849]  I think you're right.
[02:13:59.889 --> 02:14:00.849]  Clearly the vaccines.
[02:14:01.810 --> 02:14:04.853]  They told my grandmother that she got polio from the vaccine.
[02:14:06.172 --> 02:14:08.393]  Lou Ferrigno just almost got killed by a vaccine.
[02:14:08.773 --> 02:14:11.814]  And it's just crazy how we're all just kind of calm about it.
[02:14:11.854 --> 02:14:13.975]  You know, and I'm not saying you're bad or I'm bad or anybody's bad.
[02:14:14.375 --> 02:14:21.698]  I'm just saying, look at how we just, we're conservatives or we're Christians and we just kind of, well, that's the way it is.
[02:14:21.838 --> 02:14:23.039]  Who's behind this?
[02:14:23.059 --> 02:14:24.359]  Because they know what they're doing.
[02:14:24.919 --> 02:14:26.860]  They admit in their white papers they're doing this.
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:28.881]  Well, how about we start researching
[02:14:30.663 --> 02:14:44.176]  The people that are involved in this, and who they are, and making a list and checking it twice, show that as they try to build the collapse of civilization, to use their Islamic terror rings or whatever, just like the Yellow Vest, there's a two-way street there.
[02:14:45.378 --> 02:14:48.801]  And I'm not calling for any offensive operations at this time.
[02:14:49.602 --> 02:14:52.685]  And I'll never sit here and try to command people or tell them a time or place.
[02:14:53.045 --> 02:14:54.307]  Everybody's got it in their own gut.
[02:14:55.253 --> 02:15:02.181]  But I'm telling you, these eugenicists, these mad scientists, they want to hide behind the politicians and carry all this stuff out.
[02:15:02.261 --> 02:15:02.822]  I'm telling you.
[02:15:04.364 --> 02:15:04.904]  I'm telling you.
[02:15:04.924 --> 02:15:06.006]  They need to be exposed.
[02:15:06.046 --> 02:15:07.227]  They need to be looked at.
[02:15:07.608 --> 02:15:08.809]  They need to be stood up against.
[02:15:08.849 --> 02:15:12.433]  Because another reason we're under attack is we exposed the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:15:12.934 --> 02:15:15.096]  But Wildman, God bless you and I appreciate you calling.
[02:15:15.116 --> 02:15:15.457]  Great call.
[02:15:17.958 --> 02:15:19.582]  So many callers, so little time here.
[02:15:19.802 --> 02:15:23.911]  We got Matt in Ohio, and Kathleen, and a bunch of others, and Sean.
[02:15:24.372 --> 02:15:25.655]  We'll go to break, come back with your calls.
[02:15:25.735 --> 02:15:26.957]  Please don't forget, just briefly.
[02:15:28.356 --> 02:15:35.059]  We're only here because you fund us, and we try to make it easy to get really good products you need that really work great, so you keep ordering them.
[02:15:35.319 --> 02:15:36.820]  And you've been doing that because they're awesome.
[02:15:37.401 --> 02:15:40.262]  We go out and find out whatever the best-selling supplements are with the top ratings.
[02:15:40.582 --> 02:15:41.903]  We private-label them, lower the price.
[02:15:41.983 --> 02:15:43.343]  And we've never had prices this low.
[02:15:43.704 --> 02:15:44.924]  Inventory clear out for the year.
[02:15:45.805 --> 02:15:47.225]  50 to 75% off storewide.
[02:15:47.265 --> 02:15:52.288]  Free shipping, double Patreon points, and a free t-shirt with every order at infowarstore.com.
[02:15:52.328 --> 02:15:53.809]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:15:54.689 --> 02:15:56.130]  It's really pissing the globalist off.
[02:15:56.983 --> 02:15:59.005]  Do your Christmas shopping today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:08.333 --> 02:16:16.580]  Please, don't forget, we're running the biggest specials ever in InfoWars because Soros and the Globalists are on record trying to take all of our payment processors and totally shut us down.
[02:16:16.781 --> 02:16:18.082]  And so, this is the war.
[02:16:18.102 --> 02:16:20.984]  They're taking everyone off the air they think is effective.
[02:16:21.004 --> 02:16:23.827]  But InfoWars is still standing because you financially supported us.
[02:16:24.287 --> 02:16:30.710]  I have usually inventory for 5-6 months in t-shirts, in books, in films, in supplements, in coffee.
[02:16:30.890 --> 02:16:40.293]  This time, I am doing sales that are clearly 30-40% bigger than they've ever been, because we have a plan to shell everything out of the warehouse.
[02:16:40.353 --> 02:16:43.254]  And we've already got the model ready to go with sponsors.
[02:16:43.274 --> 02:16:48.537]  Something you've seen me discard, you hear the radio, that's fine, but I've discarded sponsorship for about 7-8 years.
[02:16:48.557 --> 02:16:49.537]  It's been successful.
[02:16:49.597 --> 02:16:52.258]  Directly getting funding from you with great products, but if they take
[02:16:52.298 --> 02:16:53.179]  That way, don't worry.
[02:16:53.359 --> 02:16:56.142]  I've got all the big sponsors lined up as well.
[02:16:56.462 --> 02:16:57.623]  And if we keep both, that's even better.
[02:16:57.643 --> 02:16:59.385]  We'll just expand Battlefront even faster.
[02:16:59.425 --> 02:17:00.827]  But we're not giving up effort.
[02:17:00.867 --> 02:17:02.688]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[02:17:02.728 --> 02:17:09.695]  So, you need to support us, but you're supporting yourself, not fighting traffic, not fighting the crowds, getting great presents, helping the economy, all the rest of it.
[02:17:09.775 --> 02:17:11.077]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[02:17:11.157 --> 02:17:12.258]  Hey, we're all Alex Jones.
[02:17:12.438 --> 02:17:13.299]  Don't censor me.
[02:17:13.359 --> 02:17:14.040]  Get in the flag.
[02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:14.921]  Black on white t-shirts.
[02:17:15.101 --> 02:17:16.422]  It's unisex, great for men and women.
[02:17:16.482 --> 02:17:17.043]  You pick your side.
[02:17:17.063 --> 02:17:17.263]  It's free.
[02:17:17.403 --> 02:17:17.843]  Free shipping.
[02:17:17.923 --> 02:17:19.304]  Double Patriot points in your next order.
[02:17:19.324 --> 02:17:20.445]  10% to the 5% every dollar.
[02:17:20.505 --> 02:17:24.007]  You know, we have a special going where we have a special every day where something is 60% off.
[02:17:24.027 --> 02:17:26.589]  But go look at all the specials because some things are 75% off.
[02:17:47.683 --> 02:17:49.284]  And it's all flying out.
[02:17:49.444 --> 02:17:54.305]  Let me tell you, at the warehouse here in Austin, the little elves are working 24 hours a day.
[02:17:54.325 --> 02:17:55.286]  We brought on extra chefs.
[02:17:55.646 --> 02:17:57.426]  And thanks to you, we're selling it all out.
[02:17:57.707 --> 02:17:59.627]  The entire...everything.
[02:17:59.647 --> 02:18:00.107]  Boom!
[02:18:00.167 --> 02:18:00.427]  Gone.
[02:18:00.628 --> 02:18:01.308]  It's all gonna be gone.
[02:18:01.408 --> 02:18:03.248]  In fact, this new shirt, we printed up a lot of it.
[02:18:03.348 --> 02:18:04.429]  It's about to be gone.
[02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:06.249]  We'll have a new shirt that we have inventory of.
[02:18:06.269 --> 02:18:07.730]  It'll be the new free shirt by tomorrow.
[02:18:07.970 --> 02:18:10.692]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:18:10.792 --> 02:18:18.116]  And we're going to sell out by Wednesday, they're saying, of the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration systems.
[02:18:18.177 --> 02:18:19.217]  Leading competitors are $600, $700.
[02:18:19.497 --> 02:18:20.638]  It's always a great deal at $240.
[02:18:20.698 --> 02:18:21.599]  Four-stage ion filter.
[02:18:21.779 --> 02:18:23.060]  The factory had a glut of those.
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:24.180]  They want to sell it as an inventory.
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:24.440]  It's $127.
[02:18:24.801 --> 02:18:26.762]  They're selling them to us at cost.
[02:18:26.802 --> 02:18:27.442]  We make like $30.
[02:18:28.103 --> 02:18:29.664]  No deal is even near this.
[02:18:29.964 --> 02:18:31.785]  For you and your family, get an Alexa Pure Breeze now.
[02:18:31.805 --> 02:18:34.807]  But watch, the special will be gone just like Alexa Pure Pro water filters.
[02:18:34.847 --> 02:18:35.528]  Those did sell out.
[02:18:35.608 --> 02:18:36.208]  This will be gone.
[02:18:36.408 --> 02:18:39.771]  No one even gets close to this, because we're the biggest distributor for this top company.
[02:18:39.951 --> 02:18:40.631]  We got this deal.
[02:18:40.792 --> 02:18:41.672]  No one else got this.
[02:18:41.752 --> 02:18:43.694]  You got this, because the owner is a rabid listener.
[02:18:43.834 --> 02:18:44.334]  Matt Redhawk.
[02:18:44.534 --> 02:18:45.996]  Boy, has he been harassed for being a supporter.
[02:18:46.156 --> 02:18:47.457]  Oh, let me tell you, I'm not supposed to.
[02:18:47.637 --> 02:18:48.377]  He's another patriot.
[02:18:48.397 --> 02:18:49.198]  So, we're here.
[02:18:49.378 --> 02:18:50.619]  We stand with those who stand with us.
[02:18:50.639 --> 02:18:52.020]  We thank you for supporting us.
[02:18:52.421 --> 02:18:53.341]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:18:53.381 --> 02:18:54.122]  Make that commitment.
[02:18:54.142 --> 02:18:54.622]  Get in there.
[02:18:54.742 --> 02:18:55.683]  Get the great products.
[02:18:55.723 --> 02:18:56.684]  Get the lowest prices.
[02:18:56.864 --> 02:18:59.226]  And help fund the Second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[02:19:05.322 --> 02:19:09.264]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:19:10.985 --> 02:19:13.966]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:19:14.106 --> 02:19:16.127]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:19:16.767 --> 02:19:20.609]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:19:21.069 --> 02:19:28.493]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:19:28.573 --> 02:19:30.994]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[02:19:34.412 --> 02:19:36.613]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:19:36.633 --> 02:19:37.333]  They called it U.N.
[02:19:37.353 --> 02:19:38.854]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[02:19:39.134 --> 02:19:39.815]  2030 Agenda.
[02:19:40.055 --> 02:19:50.820]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:19:52.781 --> 02:19:56.063]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:19:56.343 --> 02:19:57.263]  I mean, never.
[02:20:06.064 --> 02:20:10.545]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.128 --> 02:20:29.269]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry
[02:20:37.581 --> 02:20:43.662]  You know, I tend to get lost, and I don't want to talk about myself.
[02:20:43.702 --> 02:20:44.242]  I'm not doing that.
[02:20:44.262 --> 02:20:48.022]  I want you to know why I hate myself sometimes.
[02:20:48.082 --> 02:20:57.304]  Because I listen to a rebroadcast sometimes, and I think, I was about to talk about one subject and I go off on another.
[02:20:58.564 --> 02:20:59.304]  But here's why.
[02:20:59.464 --> 02:21:00.965]  I'm not lying.
[02:21:01.845 --> 02:21:03.065]  So then when I pull up data,
[02:21:04.355 --> 02:21:09.318]  I see a whole bunch of data and then I'll tend to like not go in the direction I wanted to.
[02:21:09.738 --> 02:21:11.599]  I'll just start talking about what I know.
[02:21:11.619 --> 02:21:24.646]  And I think most of you get that, but it's like yesterday I talked about the Seventh Day Adventists and how they allowed themselves to be tested on and some died in secret experiments because they thought that was Christ-like.
[02:21:26.047 --> 02:21:28.928]  And they were conscientious objectors that didn't want to kill people in war.
[02:21:28.948 --> 02:21:29.669]  Then I went on to say
[02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:33.271]  But some of them, you know, obviously were used as assassins.
[02:21:33.911 --> 02:21:38.932]  And I heard that later, and I'm like, well, that's not entirely accurate.
[02:21:40.532 --> 02:21:47.474]  People recruited out of those programs did it, but you could say that that was someone not following the Seventh-day Adventist religion.
[02:21:48.354 --> 02:21:56.716]  So then, and I'm not a Seventh-day Adventist, I just happen to know about it, and it's historical, and I've read about it, and I grew up in Dallas with some inside baseball with the Seventh-day Adventists.
[02:21:57.944 --> 02:21:59.384]  You've definitely got their crap together.
[02:21:59.404 --> 02:22:01.325]  I don't know of any other.
[02:22:01.625 --> 02:22:06.266]  People think Jews are like, per capita, are really active and rich and powerful and smart.
[02:22:06.827 --> 02:22:09.247]  Seventh-day Adventists are like, jumping jacks, man.
[02:22:09.267 --> 02:22:10.888]  They're just running around, involved in everything.
[02:22:12.868 --> 02:22:15.269]  But I'm digressing.
[02:22:15.289 --> 02:22:19.090]  The point is, I want to say one thing on air, and I ended up saying another thing on air.
[02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:20.190]  So I'm just going to go back to your calls.
[02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:22.891]  But I want to say this point, because it's so important.
[02:22:24.252 --> 02:22:25.332]  I talked about Plato.
[02:22:27.142 --> 02:22:40.587]  Not Plato, Plato, the most famous progenitor, the fount, the king daddy, the great granddaddy of the system of philosophy that we get from the Greeks.
[02:22:41.348 --> 02:22:45.229]  And man, you read his four or five books, and I've read most of it.
[02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:46.230]  I skipped past some of it.
[02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:47.570]  By God, it's heady stuff.
[02:22:50.351 --> 02:22:54.353]  And you know the mindset of the globalist.
[02:22:55.653 --> 02:22:56.754]  And I want to be more clear on that.
[02:22:58.430 --> 02:23:11.058]  You then read something like Sir Thomas Malthus, 350 years ago, and then you're like, oh, it's the same thing.
[02:23:11.198 --> 02:23:12.259]  It's a school of thought.
[02:23:12.719 --> 02:23:15.581]  You wonder, like, how do they put cancer viruses in vaccines?
[02:23:20.043 --> 02:23:21.704]  Why would they have compartmentalization?
[02:23:21.824 --> 02:23:23.545]  Why would they do all this horrible stuff?
[02:23:23.986 --> 02:23:27.328]  You gotta understand, Plato said this should be done.
[02:23:29.351 --> 02:23:30.031]  2,300 years ago.
[02:23:30.692 --> 02:23:32.213]  And then Malthus said it.
[02:23:32.733 --> 02:23:33.954]  You heard of Malthusianism?
[02:23:36.016 --> 02:23:47.004]  He said the health departments should be set up to crowd poor people in together and cut their food off and starve them to death and then give them smallpox blankets.
[02:23:48.005 --> 02:23:52.108]  But you just think they thought of that in the French and Indian War a hundred years later?
[02:23:53.650 --> 02:23:54.670]  In Canada and the U.S.?
[02:23:54.690 --> 02:23:54.770]  No.
[02:23:57.654 --> 02:24:04.460]  Once you know the school of thought, now you know why Hitler did it.
[02:24:04.661 --> 02:24:08.144]  Now you know why, because they were trained in it.
[02:24:12.227 --> 02:24:15.550]  Now it depends on how you apply that school of thought.
[02:24:19.734 --> 02:24:21.376]  There's the Renaissance school of thought.
[02:24:22.748 --> 02:24:23.948]  Empower the individual.
[02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:25.229]  Build humanity.
[02:24:25.549 --> 02:24:27.610]  Give as much independence to individuals as you can.
[02:24:27.650 --> 02:24:28.290]  That makes them great.
[02:24:29.290 --> 02:24:30.531]  The Malthusians come in.
[02:24:30.571 --> 02:24:31.591]  The eugenicists come in.
[02:24:31.651 --> 02:24:34.972]  The Plato-ites come in.
[02:24:35.473 --> 02:24:37.413]  And they go, oh, we got to be nice to everyone.
[02:24:37.453 --> 02:24:38.514]  Take control of them.
[02:24:38.954 --> 02:24:42.635]  That's actually a form of domination to dumb them down and make sure they don't compete with you.
[02:24:43.396 --> 02:24:47.217]  And under social Darwinism, which is just, again, Malthusianism or Plato,
[02:24:49.031 --> 02:24:58.780]  If you can beat somebody, no matter how you do it, dirty, whatever, it means you're dominant, social Darwinism, you're in charge, and you deserve to be in power.
[02:25:00.261 --> 02:25:12.572]  So if they can lie to us and sell us AI and break up our families and get our kids on smartphones and have them all brainwashed when none of the Google or Facebook or Apple people let their kids get near them, you deserve to die!
[02:25:13.613 --> 02:25:15.235]  You're chained up in Plato's cave.
[02:25:16.377 --> 02:25:18.358]  Well, they project a movie screen.
[02:25:18.478 --> 02:25:20.780]  He invented the first movie screen.
[02:25:22.261 --> 02:25:22.581]  Play-Doh.
[02:25:24.022 --> 02:25:25.843]  Truth was, they were already doing it in theater back then.
[02:25:26.544 --> 02:25:37.290]  Is that you'd have a big fire, and behind it you'd have brass plates, mirrors, primitive metal mirrors that would push the firelight onto the wall.
[02:25:38.671 --> 02:25:44.075]  And people would sit in front of that, not look at the fire, and
[02:25:45.939 --> 02:25:50.542]  People would basically do like you do with your kids in front of a projector or a light where you do like dinosaurs fighting or whatever.
[02:25:51.242 --> 02:25:53.783]  And they would bring in puppets and things and do puppet shows.
[02:25:54.564 --> 02:25:56.745]  The old Greek puppet shows weren't people with puppets.
[02:25:57.385 --> 02:25:58.146]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:25:58.626 --> 02:26:04.229]  It's puppets projected through light onto a screen, the movie theater.
[02:26:05.570 --> 02:26:12.294]  And he said the people that are most into that are mesmerized, are hypnotized,
[02:26:14.215 --> 02:26:33.162]  And he said, that is a allegory for how we, the illuminated, this is their own contemporary system, not a Jewish cosmology of Lucifer, but still, Lucifer meaning light, we, those of light, are the fire.
[02:26:34.183 --> 02:26:42.826]  And while we live up on the surface, they're down there with our reflected light, with what we decide to show them, and we govern their entire future.
[02:26:43.894 --> 02:26:45.075]  And what did he call for?
[02:26:48.338 --> 02:26:50.180]  Everything we now live under.
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:52.422]  He envisioned everything.
[02:26:54.984 --> 02:27:07.595]  He said we'll find the secrets of what makes good breeding, but in the process we'll have to exterminate the general public, so we'll have to use games entertainment in the process to further dumb them down.
[02:27:08.922 --> 02:27:11.907]  And then he discussed the different processes to carry it out.
[02:27:12.347 --> 02:27:14.791]  And let me tell you, you're living in Plato's world.
[02:27:14.811 --> 02:27:17.856]  This man wrote a book called It's Plato's Planet.
[02:27:18.717 --> 02:27:19.038]  Plato.
[02:27:24.810 --> 02:27:25.190]  Plato.
[02:27:26.251 --> 02:27:28.834]  You can sit here and look at any of this other stuff.
[02:27:29.134 --> 02:27:38.942]  It'll never make sense until you read 800 page books written by that guy and you're like, oh my goodness, this guy, everything he wrote.
[02:27:38.962 --> 02:27:42.465]  Well, there weren't many books going back over the thousands of years, but Plato's books.
[02:27:43.542 --> 02:27:44.022]  Survived.
[02:27:44.943 --> 02:27:59.154]  And whether it was in Japan 500 years ago, or China 500 years ago, or Tsarist Russia 500 years ago, or Imperial England 500 years ago, or Imperial Spain, or Imperial Portugal, or the Dutch colonies, everyone read it.
[02:27:59.374 --> 02:28:00.715]  And it's the system.
[02:28:01.836 --> 02:28:03.477]  And we live under this system.
[02:28:03.958 --> 02:28:10.943]  And that's why the globalists have come to me off record, sometimes on record, so I've said some of the names, and said, listen, you get all this, you need to come join us.
[02:28:13.803 --> 02:28:16.404]  And these are good-looking people, dressed perfectly, super nice.
[02:28:16.644 --> 02:28:17.445]  They seem genuine.
[02:28:17.465 --> 02:28:18.245]  They don't even seem evil.
[02:28:19.726 --> 02:28:20.466]  Their minions are.
[02:28:22.927 --> 02:28:25.648]  But they have decided that you're scum.
[02:28:25.808 --> 02:28:26.469]  Yeah, there's Galton.
[02:28:30.310 --> 02:28:32.411]  And they're quarterbacking the whole show.
[02:28:34.432 --> 02:28:37.954]  And so you have to understand, what you're hearing here is not my opinion.
[02:28:39.386 --> 02:28:44.648]  This is what the people that built the whole future of the world had planned.
[02:28:46.189 --> 02:28:53.832]  But, about 300 years after Plato, other people came along that had visions of how to stop it.
[02:28:54.932 --> 02:28:59.154]  Because God's not going to leave us in a situation like this without a manual to stop it.
[02:29:02.023 --> 02:29:04.565]  2018 has come and it's almost gone.
[02:29:05.325 --> 02:29:07.246]  And it's been one incredible year.
[02:29:07.286 --> 02:29:08.507]  It's been a serious fight.
[02:29:09.047 --> 02:29:13.349]  But nationalism and populism and Christianity are coming back across the world.
[02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:17.592]  Thanks to God shining through you and your family.
[02:29:17.832 --> 02:29:19.573]  Thanks to you taking action.
[02:29:19.613 --> 02:29:22.794]  So I want to thank you for what you've done.
[02:29:23.555 --> 02:29:28.177]  You are literally the strength, the blood, the guts, the wind in our sails.
[02:29:28.558 --> 02:29:28.898]  Literally.
[02:29:29.977 --> 02:29:31.758]  So I want to salute you and thank you for what you've done.
[02:29:31.778 --> 02:29:41.520]  And I want to encourage you to get great products, like the supplements and the water filtration, the air filtration, the Patriot apparel, all of it, at InfoWorksStore.com.

[02:30:05.481 --> 02:30:08.302]  Stand in the way of their plans and their operations.
[02:30:08.422 --> 02:30:20.624]  At the same time, getting amazing products like BODY's Ultimate Tumor Formula, and X2 and X3, and SuperBell Vitality, and Brain Force, and Lung Cleanse, and Knockout, and Alpha Power, and so many other amazing products.
[02:30:21.124 --> 02:30:25.625]  Whatever the best products are, we do the research, and that's what we bring you, because we want to work for you.
[02:30:25.945 --> 02:30:27.765]  We want it to be amazing, so you order it again.
[02:30:28.106 --> 02:30:29.966]  We treat you just like we want to be treated.

[02:30:32.647 --> 02:30:38.671]  You know, the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you, and then Christ's rule, lay down your life for others.
[02:30:38.691 --> 02:30:40.912]  Isn't that the world you want to live in?
[02:30:41.353 --> 02:30:44.134]  With a bunch of heroes, people that are ready to fight and stand up?
[02:30:44.174 --> 02:30:45.435]  So a bunch of backstabbing cowards?
[02:30:46.175 --> 02:30:48.037]  That's the world that builds civilization.
[02:30:48.097 --> 02:30:49.317]  That's the world that builds it all.
[02:30:49.618 --> 02:30:54.000]  So when I treat you like I want to be treated, it's because I respect myself and I respect you.
[02:30:54.480 --> 02:30:55.421]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:30:55.701 --> 02:30:56.402]  Biggest sales ever.
[02:30:56.422 --> 02:30:58.663]  Free shipping storewide, and so much more.
[02:30:58.683 --> 02:30:59.523]  But it's your last chance.
[02:30:59.564 --> 02:31:00.124]  Please take action.
[02:31:01.653 --> 02:31:08.118]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:31:09.819 --> 02:31:11.261]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:31:11.501 --> 02:31:15.284]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double Patriot points.
[02:31:17.603 --> 02:31:23.532]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[02:31:24.313 --> 02:31:30.402]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free colloidal silver iodine fortified super blue that we make like three bucks on at this sale.
[02:31:30.782 --> 02:31:31.984]  You'll get a free gift
[02:31:32.725 --> 02:31:36.027]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:31:36.067 --> 02:31:40.570]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:45.754]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[02:31:46.074 --> 02:31:49.216]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[02:31:49.296 --> 02:31:57.001]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have, beyond any other sale we've ever had, the free gift.
[02:31:57.502 --> 02:31:58.903]  So this is a loss leader.
[02:32:00.137 --> 02:32:06.461]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[02:32:06.921 --> 02:32:08.662]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[02:32:08.722 --> 02:32:13.665]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[02:32:14.126 --> 02:32:14.706]  It's big.
[02:32:15.166 --> 02:32:15.607]  It's bad.
[02:32:16.007 --> 02:32:21.230]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[02:32:21.250 --> 02:32:23.551]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[02:32:23.992 --> 02:32:27.194]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[02:32:27.794 --> 02:32:28.757]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:32:28.777 --> 02:32:29.960]  That's been going on for over a month.
[02:32:30.723 --> 02:32:31.946]  50 to 75% off.
[02:32:31.986 --> 02:32:32.989]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[02:32:34.053 --> 02:32:34.994]  The Double Patriot points!
[02:32:35.014 --> 02:32:35.934]  That's what happened in about a week.
[02:32:36.274 --> 02:32:42.898]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day, a free gift on top of it, and special mega-sales every day.
[02:32:43.359 --> 02:32:47.741]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:32:47.781 --> 02:32:49.642]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:32:49.903 --> 02:32:51.724]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[02:32:51.924 --> 02:32:53.965]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:54.145 --> 02:32:58.148]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[02:33:05.465 --> 02:33:08.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.289 --> 02:33:21.651]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:22.411 --> 02:33:25.852]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:26.552 --> 02:33:28.073]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:46.218 --> 02:33:53.422]  So, a top UK official admits that bringing in more illegal aliens drives down wages.
[02:33:55.863 --> 02:33:56.984]  That's on newswars.com.
[02:33:58.164 --> 02:34:03.908]  Endless supply of cheap labor damages native population and doesn't help the third world population.
[02:34:06.829 --> 02:34:07.550]  But we know that.
[02:34:09.851 --> 02:34:15.534]  It helps the globalists who don't want a vibrant middle class that politically always demands freedom.
[02:34:17.725 --> 02:34:19.706]  And a stairway to the poor.
[02:34:21.646 --> 02:34:24.367]  The globalists want a post-industrial world for all of us.
[02:34:26.708 --> 02:34:29.429]  But then you see Bernie Sanders and Alexander Cortez.
[02:34:33.371 --> 02:34:34.291]  Bernie Sanders is evil.
[02:34:34.311 --> 02:34:35.071]  He knows what he's doing.
[02:34:35.091 --> 02:34:35.692]  It's Cortez.
[02:34:35.732 --> 02:34:37.012]  It's just unbelievably stupid.
[02:34:39.673 --> 02:34:42.234]  And you notice she's up there.
[02:34:43.991 --> 02:34:45.451]  Saying, why are you afraid of socialism?
[02:34:45.692 --> 02:34:49.473]  And the meme is, because socialists eat their dogs, we walk them.
[02:34:50.153 --> 02:34:50.973]  Capitalists walk them.
[02:34:53.394 --> 02:34:56.635]  But Sanders, he's a whole other kettle of fish.
[02:34:59.776 --> 02:35:06.058]  And they're out there running their mouths constantly about how great socialism is and how great open borders are.
[02:35:07.478 --> 02:35:09.079]  And basically what they do is they cut your legs off.
[02:35:09.179 --> 02:35:12.119]  Sanders is always like, we need a minimum wage of $15.
[02:35:16.889 --> 02:35:25.317]  But he doesn't tell you, because most people don't run a business, that you've then got to pay about $7, $8, $9, $10 and other taxes and regulations and stuff on that employee.
[02:35:26.298 --> 02:35:30.342]  So a $15 employee is about a $23 employee in Texas.
[02:35:30.422 --> 02:35:31.563]  It's higher in some states.
[02:35:33.585 --> 02:35:35.187]  Yeah, you pay somebody $15 an hour, it's $23.
[02:35:35.727 --> 02:35:38.170]  I pay crew members $30, $40 an hour on average.
[02:35:38.690 --> 02:35:39.992]  I'm paying like $50 an hour.
[02:35:41.089 --> 02:35:42.310]  That's what people don't see.
[02:35:42.650 --> 02:35:43.831]  So what you do is you don't open.
[02:35:44.071 --> 02:35:44.992]  You don't hire people.
[02:35:45.292 --> 02:35:48.154]  The owner works all the time in his own hamburger place.
[02:35:49.815 --> 02:36:01.484]  Because he can't afford the three or four jerk-offs that are all gonna screw around and pick boogers and play video games the whole time, when he could do the job of three people and actually pay for his daughter's tuition.
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:18.789]  But the average person, the average 16-year-old zit-faced, you know, person, looks up and goes, Bernie Sanders wants to give me free health care and free college, and he says I need $15, but this local diner is only going to pay me $9.
[02:36:19.029 --> 02:36:23.111]  Yeah, kid, because after all the taxes and crap, you're getting paid $15.
[02:36:24.632 --> 02:36:28.215]  But see, kid, you'll never get the job now, because there isn't going to be one there for you.
[02:36:28.996 --> 02:36:32.597]  So, rising economy raises wages regardless.
[02:36:32.617 --> 02:36:33.377]  That's the healthy way.
[02:36:33.937 --> 02:36:37.898]  But instead, oh, Bernie Sanders, he's gonna get you $15 an hour.
[02:36:38.198 --> 02:36:41.338]  It's just the job then won't exist, Sonny boy.
[02:36:41.358 --> 02:36:50.060]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls.
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:50.640]  I apologize.
[02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:51.280]  I'm out of control.
[02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:56.361]  Let's talk to Kathleen in California, then we'll go to Sean and Ethan and others.
[02:36:56.401 --> 02:36:57.201]  Kathleen, thanks for holding.
[02:36:58.523 --> 02:36:59.164]  Thank you.
[02:36:59.244 --> 02:37:01.805]  This is my first time speaking with you.
[02:37:01.825 --> 02:37:22.578]  I've been trying to reach you before because I have so much to say and I understand why you jump around because the public's basically, you know, overwhelmed with the amount of destruction and with the financial terrorism, vaccines, the educational system.
[02:37:23.397 --> 02:37:36.561]  And, you know, getting people arguing and conflicting with each other while these guys are behind the scenes or doing all these hidden, covert things against us.
[02:37:36.881 --> 02:37:45.924]  And so I understand, you know, with the wavelengths, the electromagnetic fields and the matrix so that they can
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:50.103]  Implant us with ideas and the TV.
[02:37:50.463 --> 02:37:52.045]  People watch TV.
[02:37:52.105 --> 02:37:54.266]  You're you're hypnotized by it.
[02:37:54.707 --> 02:37:56.388]  You know, everything you say.
[02:37:57.069 --> 02:37:59.070]  I've been saying things for years.
[02:37:59.170 --> 02:38:07.477]  I'm very I'm an herbal nutritionist and have created many products and your products are absolutely fantastic.
[02:38:08.386 --> 02:38:10.388]  I recommend them to my clients.
[02:38:10.489 --> 02:38:12.050]  I have them order them.
[02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:14.473]  I order lots of products from you.
[02:38:14.753 --> 02:38:18.497]  Well ma'am, I really appreciate you saying that, but obviously I'm not a sociopath.
[02:38:19.098 --> 02:38:19.879]  But if I was...
[02:38:21.354 --> 02:38:21.774]  I don't know.
[02:38:41.266 --> 02:38:44.808]  And then if you know about the scam, the programming doesn't work against you.
[02:38:44.988 --> 02:38:45.909]  I think it irritates you.
[02:38:45.949 --> 02:38:46.689]  I know it does me.
[02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:50.712]  But I don't think the programming works once you're aware of it.
[02:38:50.732 --> 02:38:51.372]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:38:52.333 --> 02:38:53.393]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:38:53.453 --> 02:38:57.456]  And I think the basic on this whole thing is education.
[02:38:58.036 --> 02:39:00.457]  People understanding the words.
[02:39:01.198 --> 02:39:09.723]  And that's where they really, I think, that really screwed the students and the people is the amount of
[02:39:10.753 --> 02:39:16.235]  On different subjects and nomenclature, understanding the language itself.
[02:39:16.855 --> 02:39:25.337]  And when you pass things you don't understand, you physiologically, you mentally go blank.
[02:39:25.637 --> 02:39:27.218]  You can't comprehend.
[02:39:27.978 --> 02:39:34.160]  And if that technology is known, you can control a public with just that alone.
[02:39:36.479 --> 02:39:48.462]  And then with the vaccinations and the flu shots, which to me are vaccinations, and I've been saying for years to my clients and friends, do not get vaccinated.
[02:39:48.862 --> 02:39:50.183]  That stuff is horrible.
[02:39:50.223 --> 02:39:52.903]  They're actually creating the very problem.
[02:39:53.303 --> 02:40:02.106]  And I know in the government's records, it even showed like when they were giving the live polio vaccination, the smallpox, which was outlawed in the 60s,
[02:40:03.908 --> 02:40:08.513]  But when they were giving the shots, the actual disease came back.
[02:40:08.614 --> 02:40:09.314]  It increased.
[02:40:09.795 --> 02:40:10.215]  Oh, I know.
[02:40:10.336 --> 02:40:12.038]  I have the newspaper articles when it happened.
[02:40:12.278 --> 02:40:14.821]  Listen, my grandmother was an awesome lady.
[02:40:14.901 --> 02:40:18.345]  I mean, she was a beauty queen, super Christian, loving lady.
[02:40:18.365 --> 02:40:20.988]  And, you know, she had two children with my grandfather.
[02:40:21.208 --> 02:40:22.870]  And then it just devastated her life.
[02:40:22.890 --> 02:40:23.651]  She almost died.
[02:40:24.552 --> 02:40:28.515]  And the doctors told her, the vaccine gave it to you, but it's for the greater good, honey.
[02:40:29.256 --> 02:40:42.186]  And it's just so sick that when we've experienced this, we've been through this, personally, people in this office, I know two people that work here, I won't say their names, had their children die from vaccines.
[02:40:42.927 --> 02:40:46.149]  You know, Lou Ferrigno, they said, oh, you got real sick and swole up and couldn't walk.
[02:40:46.689 --> 02:40:49.051]  Someone didn't clean the spot they injected it.
[02:40:49.571 --> 02:40:50.351]  No, Lou!
[02:40:51.132 --> 02:40:51.832]  No, Lou!
[02:40:52.413 --> 02:40:54.054]  That's not what happened, buddy boy.
[02:40:54.434 --> 02:40:55.695]  Read the insert.
[02:40:56.435 --> 02:40:58.496]  And Lou will say, I can't believe it!
[02:40:59.877 --> 02:41:01.838]  It says it can give you Guillain-Barré.
[02:41:01.858 --> 02:41:05.640]  I was sore and couldn't walk, and they told me it was good.
[02:41:06.021 --> 02:41:07.401]  But I'm making fun of his voice.
[02:41:07.421 --> 02:41:08.022]  That's how he talks.
[02:41:09.841 --> 02:41:15.344]  You know, just in the final equation, stop being so trusting, Lou, because you're a big, gentle giant.
[02:41:16.224 --> 02:41:17.605]  I come from a good family, good people.
[02:41:17.625 --> 02:41:19.145]  A lot of people that know Lou Ferringo's family.
[02:41:19.626 --> 02:41:22.907]  Just because you're a nice guy doesn't mean people outside your head are nice, buddy.
[02:41:23.187 --> 02:41:23.648]  Grow up!
[02:41:23.668 --> 02:41:25.328]  Before you're dead!
[02:41:25.989 --> 02:41:26.909]  God bless you, Kathleen.
[02:41:26.949 --> 02:41:27.609]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:27.629 --> 02:41:30.611]  Oh, God.
[02:41:30.631 --> 02:41:32.312]  You know, I wanted to play this Mark Dice piece.
[02:41:33.263 --> 02:41:35.544]  About the attack on the First Amendment and also Tucker Carlson.
[02:41:36.064 --> 02:41:37.445]  But I also want to go to your phone calls.
[02:41:37.585 --> 02:41:39.746]  And we've got Matt Bracken coming up.
[02:41:39.766 --> 02:41:40.346]  So let's do this.
[02:41:40.426 --> 02:41:41.207]  Call Matt Bracken.
[02:41:42.367 --> 02:41:42.968]  He loves calls.
[02:41:43.208 --> 02:41:44.308]  But see if he wants these calls.
[02:41:45.009 --> 02:41:46.429]  If he doesn't, I'm going to have to let everybody go.
[02:41:46.489 --> 02:41:47.070]  It's our fault.
[02:41:47.110 --> 02:41:47.910]  We've got like 20 phone lines.
[02:41:48.270 --> 02:41:49.151]  But I appreciate everybody calling.
[02:41:49.551 --> 02:41:50.231]  So just stay on hold.
[02:41:50.251 --> 02:41:52.152]  We'll find out if Matt's going to want to talk to you.
[02:41:52.172 --> 02:41:54.253]  Because he's a really smart guy on all these topics.
[02:41:54.433 --> 02:41:57.094]  Or if whatever needs to happen is going to happen.
[02:42:00.129 --> 02:42:01.309]  I mean, I do care.
[02:42:01.889 --> 02:42:02.349]  I do feel.
[02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:05.550]  And I don't say that in some virtue signaling.
[02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:13.771]  I mean, I love people and I love the average person, but I also then feel very aggressive and very angry towards bad people.
[02:42:14.671 --> 02:42:28.114]  And I only tell you that because I know sometimes the show can be a train wreck, but I just, I thank God every morning that at least we have conscience, a connection to God.
[02:42:28.134 --> 02:42:28.854]  At least we have a soul.
[02:42:29.724 --> 02:42:31.325]  So I thank the crew for the great job they've done.
[02:42:31.365 --> 02:42:35.729]  Everybody else, there's so much more coming up with this Tucker Carlson piece, this Mark Knight piece that are very powerful.
[02:42:36.749 --> 02:42:37.770]  And again, you've stood with us.
[02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:38.611]  You're so amazing.
[02:42:38.631 --> 02:42:40.072]  You humble me, listeners.
[02:42:41.513 --> 02:42:43.034]  All the calls today have been the best ever.
[02:42:43.094 --> 02:42:49.979]  You humble me and you really make me very, very thankful to be alive and you give me hope.
[02:42:50.019 --> 02:42:54.182]  So I want to salute you and the crew and all the local radio stations and TV stations.
[02:42:54.583 --> 02:42:56.044]  If you're listening to local radio stations,
[02:42:57.202 --> 02:42:58.903]  Spread the word about those stations and support them.
[02:42:59.244 --> 02:43:00.164]  Thank you.
[02:43:01.065 --> 02:43:01.906]  Look, we all do it.
[02:43:02.506 --> 02:43:03.867]  A lot of times we don't have a choice.
[02:43:03.887 --> 02:43:11.673]  You go on a trip, you book into a big globalist hotel that funds groups trying to take our guns and teach our five-year-old boys how to wear dresses.
[02:43:12.133 --> 02:43:12.594]  It's a fact.
[02:43:12.614 --> 02:43:16.717]  These corporations are out to conquer humanity, not to break up our families.
[02:43:17.417 --> 02:43:20.960]  And sometimes I can't find an item in another online shop, I go to Amazon.
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:23.682]  But I consciously try to not do it.
[02:43:24.847 --> 02:43:33.715]  In fact, when I use a product, or I hear about folks that like a product, I tend to get the product and then sell it at a huge discount at nymphomorestore.com.
[02:43:34.516 --> 02:43:42.563]  There aren't many places where you can go where you're going to find items lower than Amazon, because they have created a total monopoly.
[02:43:42.843 --> 02:43:45.906]  They get like $1.48 on every shipment from the federal government.
[02:43:46.226 --> 02:43:46.887]  We don't do that.
[02:43:48.254 --> 02:43:52.336]  But we still bring you deals so good that in many cases it's better than Amazon.
[02:43:52.456 --> 02:43:59.479]  So you're funding the second American Revolution, you're sticking it in the eye of the globalists, and you're getting great products all at the same time.
[02:43:59.879 --> 02:44:01.980]  It's called a 360 win.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:11.463]  I talk about that a lot, but you're not getting a 360 win when you go to Target or Walmart and buy a toy that breaks when you get it out of the box.
[02:44:12.324 --> 02:44:13.044]  And I'm not judging you.
[02:44:13.544 --> 02:44:14.765]  I was at the mall a week ago,
[02:44:17.137 --> 02:44:20.460]  19-month-old daughter saw this little robot car.
[02:44:21.401 --> 02:44:22.082]  She wanted it.
[02:44:22.682 --> 02:44:23.743]  I bought it from the woman.
[02:44:24.524 --> 02:44:27.407]  It was broken when I got home and didn't work.
[02:44:29.168 --> 02:44:31.290]  Well, we're not selling products like that.
[02:44:31.330 --> 02:44:39.418]  Whether it's the water filtration, the air filtration, the supplements, the books, the videos, the patron apparel, it's all the very best at the lowest prices.
[02:44:39.478 --> 02:44:42.701]  So, we have the 12 Days of Christmas, the biggest sale in our history.
[02:44:43.649 --> 02:44:45.309]  We're selling on inventory ahead of the end of the year.
[02:44:46.170 --> 02:44:51.291]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% is the lowest discount, up to 75%.
[02:44:51.511 --> 02:44:53.571]  We're losing money on a lot of these.
[02:44:53.991 --> 02:44:55.191]  So we have the 12 days of Christmas.
[02:44:55.491 --> 02:44:58.332]  One item every day was particularly discounted up to 75%.
[02:44:58.432 --> 02:45:07.094]  We're bringing all of those sales back up until the 19th, when you're still guaranteed to get delivered to the continental United States before Christmas.
[02:45:08.734 --> 02:45:11.655]  Biggest sale in our history, extended, and now
[02:45:12.945 --> 02:45:13.997]  All the super sales!
[02:45:14.827 --> 02:45:15.667]  That we're already there.
[02:45:15.687 --> 02:45:19.748]  The very best sales the last 12 days are all brought back right now.
[02:45:20.068 --> 02:45:24.169]  While not fighting traffic and not fighting all the stupid crowds at the big box stores.
[02:45:24.449 --> 02:45:27.689]  And not giving your money to Jeff Bezos that literally wants to gang rape this country.
[02:45:28.269 --> 02:45:33.130]  These specials were such massive lost leaders that we can only promote them for 24 hours.
[02:45:33.450 --> 02:45:38.811]  But now we're bringing back all of our M4s, Christmas mega specials, at m4store.com for a limited time.
[02:45:39.111 --> 02:45:41.612]  And many are already completely selling out.
[02:45:42.232 --> 02:45:43.452]  So everything we had
[02:45:44.272 --> 02:45:48.253]  He is back on sale at the lowest price, except for items that have already sold out.

[02:45:54.854 --> 02:46:04.157]  I have made the decision to completely sell out our entire 2018 inventory at some of the lowest prices ever to avoid paying ridiculous amounts of government inventory tax.

[02:46:56.738 --> 02:46:58.179]  Infowarscore.com.
[02:47:05.365 --> 02:47:08.086]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.370 --> 02:47:19.350]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:21.091]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:26.519 --> 02:47:29.721]  If you grew up in this country, you remember hearing it when you were a kid.
[02:47:29.961 --> 02:47:31.542]  This is a free country.
[02:47:31.682 --> 02:47:33.483]  The Constitution gives us freedom.
[02:47:33.663 --> 02:47:39.186]  And the first freedom, literally the first number in the Bill of Rights, is freedom of speech.
[02:47:39.226 --> 02:47:41.227]  And for generations, that was unquestioned here.
[02:47:41.487 --> 02:47:43.369]  It was the most celebrated of our rights.
[02:47:43.949 --> 02:47:48.071]  But increasingly, it is seen by the people in charge as an annoying relic.
[02:47:49.192 --> 02:47:49.812]  Don't believe us?
[02:47:50.092 --> 02:47:54.635]  Try to say something unauthorized in your workplace, or on campus, or even on a street corner.
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:57.441]  Why have things changed?
[02:47:57.461 --> 02:47:59.842]  Well, because the attitudes of our leaders have changed.
[02:48:00.002 --> 02:48:04.385]  And we have a small clip that tells you a lot about what they really believe.
[02:48:04.425 --> 02:48:16.032]  This is California Congressman Ted Lieu, and he's explaining in this clip that sadly he's prevented from banning talk he doesn't like by a pesky legal antique called the Constitution.
[02:48:16.052 --> 02:48:16.452]  Watch this.
[02:48:17.948 --> 02:48:21.834]  I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech.
[02:48:22.414 --> 02:48:24.757]  The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.
[02:48:25.318 --> 02:48:27.721]  And that's simply a function of the First Amendment.
[02:48:27.741 --> 02:48:32.968]  But I think over the long run, it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech.
[02:48:35.592 --> 02:48:39.074]  The CNN anchor just sort of nods like, of course, we'd all like to regulate speech if we could.
[02:48:39.595 --> 02:48:43.277]  Over the long run, he says, it's better not to regulate speech, end quote.
[02:48:43.558 --> 02:48:48.461]  Does that sound like someone who is deeply committed to a free society and its benefits?
[02:48:49.262 --> 02:48:55.906]  Or is it simply a bully admitting that, for now, the law won't let him do what he wants to do, which is control your mind?
[02:48:56.587 --> 02:48:57.347]  I think you know the answer.
[02:48:58.568 --> 02:49:03.955]  Well, the left increasingly is using big tech, threats, and public shaming to stamp out political views it doesn't like.
[02:49:04.075 --> 02:49:10.022]  They're also ruining actors and comedians and anyone else who dares stray from the script.
[02:49:10.542 --> 02:49:12.204]  But not everybody is so limited.
[02:49:12.605 --> 02:49:16.930]  We learned that today when one cable host used a slur to describe a member of the Trump administration.
[02:49:18.703 --> 02:49:21.144]  Why doesn't Mike Pompeo care right now?
[02:49:21.985 --> 02:49:28.948]  Are the pathetic deflections that we just heard, when he appeared on Fox & Friends, is that a patriot speaking?
[02:49:29.908 --> 02:49:31.829]  Or a wannabe dictator's butt boy?
[02:49:31.849 --> 02:49:36.091]  I'm dead serious, I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot?
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:41.901]  So, the anchor apologized for that remark.
[02:49:42.802 --> 02:49:44.422]  But the question is, will she be punished?
[02:49:44.502 --> 02:49:47.143]  And of course, needless to say, we don't think she should be punished.
[02:49:47.603 --> 02:49:49.444]  She was saying what she thinks, or she misspoke.
[02:49:49.464 --> 02:49:50.504]  It happens to everybody.
[02:49:51.064 --> 02:49:52.425]  She shouldn't face sanction for that.
[02:49:52.465 --> 02:49:54.185]  But then, neither should Kevin Hart.
[02:49:54.886 --> 02:50:01.588]  But the left now has a long history as the only faction enjoying impunity for what it says.
[02:50:03.638 --> 02:50:06.660]  You talk like a sign language gorilla who got hit in the head.
[02:50:06.801 --> 02:50:10.243]  In fact, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's d***holster.
[02:50:10.423 --> 02:50:14.867]  You're a presidential librarian.
[02:50:14.887 --> 02:50:17.949]  You give him a damn robe and you let him do whatever the hell he wants.
[02:50:17.989 --> 02:50:23.974]  Because this right now, this is my audition for Mr. Trump's cabinet.
[02:50:24.134 --> 02:50:27.016]  And also for a regional production of The Crucible.
[02:50:27.136 --> 02:50:31.680]  And let me tell you, Queen, I was good.
[02:50:34.656 --> 02:50:40.340]  Dave Rubin hosts the Rubin Report on YouTube, which everyone watching has watched because it's excellent and he joins us today.
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:41.261]  Dave, thanks a lot for coming on.
[02:50:42.021 --> 02:50:49.247]  So just to be totally clear, I think people ought to be able to tell jokes that I don't like, and often they do.
[02:50:49.807 --> 02:51:05.038]  What I find so interesting is at this moment of peak hysteria about speech, where you're seeing normal, decent, totally non-bigoted people destroyed, and the rest of us are completely terrified, and art and free expression is totally ground to a halt, aesthetics are suffering, no one can be creative anymore.
[02:51:05.058 --> 02:51:11.222]  At that exact moment, the left still feels totally free to say things that they would classify if others said them as bigoted.
[02:51:11.442 --> 02:51:12.003]  What's going on?
[02:51:13.476 --> 02:51:14.857]  Well, you just nailed it right there.
[02:51:14.897 --> 02:51:28.892]  I mean, quite literally, the Oscars can't even figure out who to host the show anymore, either because they can't find anyone that's politically correct enough, or that everyone that would like to do it is now afraid to do it because of the repercussions.
[02:51:29.452 --> 02:51:45.665]  But as for the clips that you just played, I mean, look, the simple truth of this is it's showing what the flaw of collectivism, which is basically the idea of judging people based on their immutable characteristics, why it is so terrible and why it has been embraced by the left.
[02:51:45.705 --> 02:51:48.447]  You know, you can't be for groups.
[02:51:48.587 --> 02:51:52.190]  It actually doesn't make sense because you will eliminate the individual every time.
[02:51:53.331 --> 02:51:54.552]  We're good to go.
[02:52:09.525 --> 02:52:09.805]  I think?
[02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:36.454]  I mean, man, I don't know when the last time I heard something that chilling coming from a government official.
[02:52:36.554 --> 02:52:42.039]  It's like, the First Amendment is the most precious thing that we have in this country.
[02:52:42.339 --> 02:52:55.609]  And I can tell you, as someone that's been on tour for most of the last year, and I've been to 20-some-odd countries in the last couple months, every single country, the people are jealous of the freedoms that we have here, and especially the freedom of speech.
[02:52:55.669 --> 02:52:57.571]  So it's like, to hear anyone, regardless
[02:52:57.671 --> 02:52:59.652]  Regardless of whether he's a Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter.
[02:52:59.913 --> 02:53:05.617]  To hear any elected official saying that, you know, he'd love to get rid of the First Amendment, whoo!
[02:53:05.817 --> 02:53:08.999]  I mean, I can't imagine anything scarier in a free society, actually.
[02:53:09.059 --> 02:53:23.170]  Very quickly, I mean, and I don't want to pound on the anchor, I don't even know who it was in that clip, but it was a news anchor whose living, obviously, is predicated on the First Amendment, didn't interrupt him and say, what, I'm sorry, Mr. Elected Official, did you just say you'd like to control people's speech?
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:28.365]  Yeah, well, it's just incredible, and we're seeing an emboldening of this.
[02:53:28.385 --> 02:53:37.820]  You know, it's interesting what you said there, that these are the same people who love to shut people down, but then at the same time they'll accidentally, or they'll intentionally say some of these things.
[02:53:37.860 --> 02:53:40.003]  You may have seen this today, deadspin, which is just an
[02:53:40.063 --> 02:53:40.583]  We're good to go.
[02:54:01.491 --> 02:54:06.073]  And that's why, again, as I always say to you, Tucker, Tucker, every time I'm on your show, what do I tell you?
[02:54:06.113 --> 02:54:17.739]  For all the disagreements, the political disagreements that we might have, which we've discussed on both my show and your show, because you are a staunch defender of free speech, I will continue to do this with you whether we agree or not.
[02:54:17.839 --> 02:54:18.980]  That's what America is about.
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:27.085]  Democrat Congressman Ted Lieu out of California is frustrated by the fact that the First Amendment is preventing him from silencing conservatives.
[02:54:27.646 --> 02:54:33.249]  So he's urging the big tech companies to start censoring more of us on the government's behalf.
[02:54:33.650 --> 02:54:46.799]  Here he is talking with CNN's Breonna Keeler yesterday, who's disappointed in him that he didn't use his time during Tuesday's hearing with Google CEO Sanjay Pichar to pressure the tech giant to increase their censorship.
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:55:00.428]  Have you thought that maybe you and other Democrats have missed opportunities to use your time to press Google's CEO at a time when these large tech companies are struggling to manage content, perpetuating conspiracy theories.
[02:55:00.869 --> 02:55:03.170]  They're so vulnerable to outside interference.
[02:55:03.270 --> 02:55:05.712]  Isn't that a focus that could have been a missed opportunity?
[02:55:07.337 --> 02:55:09.238]  So, it's a very good point you make.
[02:55:09.398 --> 02:55:13.140]  I would love if I could have more than five minutes to question witnesses.
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:15.221]  Unfortunately, I don't get that opportunity.
[02:55:15.902 --> 02:55:21.044]  However, I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech.
[02:55:21.604 --> 02:55:23.966]  The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.
[02:55:24.526 --> 02:55:34.791]  I would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves, but it's really nothing that I believe government can do, and so that's been my position all along.
[02:55:35.131 --> 02:55:41.196]  Sorry, Miss Keeler, if you're so concerned about conspiracy theories being spread around, you should probably stop working for CNN!
[02:55:41.396 --> 02:55:52.365]  This guy was one of Google's biggest cheerleaders during the hearing on Tuesday, who said that if conservatives don't like the search results on Google, or don't like what they're seeing on social media, that we should just blame ourselves!
[02:55:52.645 --> 02:56:00.011]  And to some of my colleagues across Iowa, if you're getting bad press articles and bad search results, don't blame Google, or Facebook, or Twitter.
[02:56:00.512 --> 02:56:01.753]  Consider blaming yourself.
[02:56:02.349 --> 02:56:05.352]  That little outburst made him a hero amongst the Democrats.
[02:56:05.892 --> 02:56:10.657]  How Ted Lieu became Google's accidental champion, reported The Atlantic.
[02:56:10.877 --> 02:56:15.882]  This editor for Wired Magazine called it the best moment in the Sunjai Pichai hearings.
[02:56:16.122 --> 02:56:22.809]  Yeah, it's just so cool called for the end of the First Amendment and saying that conservatives should blame themselves for being upset about that.
[02:56:23.189 --> 02:56:33.737]  And speaking of trying to undermine our republic, Senator Chuck Schumer is now tweeting in a foreign language because, well, he's a foreign agent trying to overthrow our country from within.
[02:56:34.057 --> 02:56:47.727]  And here's MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski to further illustrate the incredible double standards that the liberals have for freedom of speech, uttering a dreaded homophobic slur on the air and, of course, facing no consequences.
[02:56:48.700 --> 02:56:51.142]  I understand that Donald Trump doesn't care.
[02:56:51.162 --> 02:56:52.362]  Heilman makes a good point.
[02:56:52.382 --> 02:56:52.923]  He doesn't care.
[02:56:52.943 --> 02:56:56.065]  But why doesn't Mike Pompeo care right now?
[02:56:56.905 --> 02:57:03.869]  Are the pathetic deflections that we just heard when he appeared on Fox & Friends, is that a patriot speaking?
[02:57:04.849 --> 02:57:06.630]  Or a wannabe dictator's butt boy?
[02:57:07.711 --> 02:57:08.432]  I'm dead serious.
[02:57:08.512 --> 02:57:11.055]  I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot?
[02:57:11.195 --> 02:57:13.558]  It sounds like they tried to mute it out, but they failed.
[02:57:13.638 --> 02:57:17.782]  And I personally couldn't care less what anybody says, as long as they're not calling for violence.
[02:57:18.223 --> 02:57:22.027]  It is unprofessional, but it's MSNBC we're talking about here.
[02:57:22.387 --> 02:57:28.674]  But imagine if some YouTuber or someone on Fox News or on Twitter dared to utter that dreaded slur.
[02:57:29.215 --> 02:57:33.063]  But Mika's job is totally fine, and MSNBC's already forgotten about it.
[02:57:33.424 --> 02:57:40.237]  And she says that she meant to call him a water boy, not a... I can't even quote her, otherwise the thought police will come after me.
[02:57:52.734 --> 02:58:03.483]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history because Soros and the Globalists are all over the news trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut down our shopping carts, trying to destroy us.
[02:58:04.083 --> 02:58:07.486]  They have kicked us off almost every media outlet out there because we're loyal Americans.
[02:58:07.526 --> 02:58:19.696]  But thanks to you supporting us, we're on more radio stations and more TV stations than ever because these stations understand that Trump and myself and many others are being persecuted by the Globalists, by the Leftists, by the Hollywood scum.
[02:58:20.563 --> 02:58:22.224]  But InfoWars is in your hands.
[02:58:22.284 --> 02:58:29.991]  So this Christmas, with only a few days until Christmas left, I wanted to just thank all the viewers and listeners for your support, for your prayers, and for being in this together.
[02:58:30.171 --> 02:58:39.479]  And just to remind you again, please share the articles, please share the videos from NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, because those get around the censors easier than InfoWars.com.
[02:58:39.739 --> 02:58:45.283]  But whatever you do, realize this country and this planet is in a fight for its life against the globalists and
[02:58:46.374 --> 02:58:59.138]  It is financing that allows us to do what we do, and that's why it is a total win for everybody, because you get great products at InfoWareStore.com, and at the same time, you help fund this operation that is fearlessly fighting the globalists as hard as we can.
[02:58:59.638 --> 02:59:03.659]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[02:59:04.179 --> 02:59:12.822]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas.
[02:59:13.382 --> 02:59:14.403]  At InfoWareStore.com.
[02:59:14.683 --> 02:59:15.824]  But get your orders in.
[02:59:15.864 --> 02:59:18.126]  Don't fight those crowds and support the InfoWare.
[02:59:18.526 --> 02:59:23.209]  All the sales the last 12 days, 50-75% off, is back.
[02:59:23.289 --> 02:59:24.330]  Free shipping is still there.
[02:59:24.370 --> 02:59:25.271]  Double Patriot points.
[02:59:25.771 --> 02:59:28.673]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[02:59:29.013 --> 02:59:33.517]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[02:59:33.537 --> 02:59:34.618]  Just go check out the sales.
[02:59:34.998 --> 02:59:36.339]  There's too many to break them all down.
[02:59:36.739 --> 02:59:40.122]  Get your orders in by the 19th, so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[02:59:40.862 --> 02:59:42.603]  And thank you again all for your support.
[02:59:42.883 --> 02:59:45.065]  We're extending this sale until the 19th.
[02:59:45.605 --> 02:59:50.188]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the globals together.
[02:59:50.268 --> 02:59:50.568]  Thank you.
[02:59:54.871 --> 02:59:58.954]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.454 --> 03:00:00.795]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.357 --> 03:00:17.379]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:17.719 --> 03:00:21.781]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:00:25.304 --> 03:00:28.606]  Yeah, this is Matt Bracken in for the last hour on Friday.
[03:00:29.667 --> 03:00:38.893]  And we're into the Christmas season and I wish I was full of jolliness and good cheer, but actually I'm pretty much not.
[03:00:39.553 --> 03:00:42.115]  I've been following the news, watching the show,
[03:00:43.505 --> 03:00:47.208]  The Ted Lieu thing about wishing that we would have less free speech.
[03:00:47.468 --> 03:00:49.590]  It's deserving because that's the left today.
[03:00:50.411 --> 03:00:53.073]  They are no longer interested in a dialogue with us.
[03:00:53.153 --> 03:00:54.415]  They just want to shut us up.
[03:00:55.616 --> 03:00:59.359]  And I'm reminded of a quote from a meme that's been floating around.
[03:00:59.419 --> 03:01:07.667]  It says that genocides happen when tyrannies are coming to power and the people are disarmed.
[03:01:08.877 --> 03:01:13.319]  But civil wars happen when tyrannies are rising, but the people are armed.
[03:01:13.399 --> 03:01:18.342]  So at least it looks like we're not going to have a genocide without a civil war.
[03:01:18.402 --> 03:01:26.747]  You know, I just don't see a safe path back to the old America, you know, to the to the Democratic Republic that we knew.
[03:01:26.767 --> 03:01:36.352]  And the problem is that politically today, politicians that are on the move, they're going to see their best move
[03:01:37.637 --> 03:01:45.201]  To be appealing to their radical bases, to their extreme elements, not to appealing to the middle of America.
[03:01:45.721 --> 03:01:47.522]  That's going to be a losing proposition.
[03:01:47.542 --> 03:01:58.527]  And I kind of see a parallel today in what happened in the former Yugoslavia at the end of the Cold War, when communism was failing.
[03:01:58.547 --> 03:02:02.189]  A politician named Slobodan Milosevic
[03:02:03.197 --> 03:02:09.922]  He rose to power by appealing to radical Serbian ethnic pride.
[03:02:11.163 --> 03:02:15.907]  It got him to become the prime minister, but it ensured that there would be a civil war.
[03:02:16.847 --> 03:02:21.091]  And something similar to that is going to happen, I think, in the United States, unfortunately.
[03:02:21.111 --> 03:02:25.013]  I don't see a moderate ever coming to power.
[03:02:25.074 --> 03:02:30.778]  I think that if Trump is elected for another term, it'll probably be a miracle.
[03:02:31.556 --> 03:02:37.220]  You know, the Democrats are going to be gunning for him for the next two years with all, you know, all barrels blazing.
[03:02:38.181 --> 03:02:42.224]  And you can see today how we're just in a battle of competing narratives.
[03:02:43.345 --> 03:02:49.889]  If you watch Fox or conservative media, you can see that, you know, the Uranium One scandal has never been investigated.
[03:02:50.530 --> 03:02:52.371]  Hillary Clinton got a complete walk.
[03:02:53.112 --> 03:02:56.955]  But if you turn the channel a few clicks over to watch CNN or MSNBC,
[03:02:57.998 --> 03:03:02.740]  All you'll hear is that President Trump was somehow involved with Russians.
[03:03:02.820 --> 03:03:21.889]  It's never really explained that all of his cabinet members are deserting him, that he's a complete failure, that he'll probably be impeached over campaign contribution violations, which is, we know, bogus, but that's the narrative that's being floated to half of the country.
[03:03:22.389 --> 03:03:26.091]  So you can see these forces are just pulling us apart.
[03:03:26.781 --> 03:03:30.083]  And I don't see a way back to safety.
[03:03:30.664 --> 03:03:36.568]  So I guess the message today is, you know, buy some more ammunition for Christmas.
[03:03:37.248 --> 03:03:41.071]  And if you only have one AR-15, you better get another one.
[03:03:42.759 --> 03:03:47.361]  States like New Jersey, they've banned magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.
[03:03:48.022 --> 03:03:57.347]  It's just a question of time before they start arresting people, because they can tell by who's bought what where these magazines are.
[03:03:58.068 --> 03:04:04.011]  Even in my own state of Florida, they're doing these RPOs, these public safety orders.
[03:04:04.031 --> 03:04:10.135]  The initials are different in each state, but they red flag gun owners
[03:04:11.181 --> 03:04:13.703]  And literally go to their house to collect their guns.
[03:04:14.324 --> 03:04:17.426]  I don't see a soft landing out of all of this.
[03:04:17.566 --> 03:04:18.226]  I really don't.
[03:04:19.467 --> 03:04:27.033]  And, you know, if history is a guide, I think that civil war is ahead of us, unfortunately.
[03:04:27.794 --> 03:04:29.975]  Anyway, that's my cheerful Christmas message.
[03:04:30.816 --> 03:04:37.081]  And we'll maybe get to the range and do some shooting and have some fun where we can.
[03:04:37.893 --> 03:04:41.376]  When we come back from the break, I'm going to take calls for the rest of the hour.
[03:04:42.117 --> 03:04:45.280]  Matt Bracken for Alex, last hour of InfoWords.
[03:05:03.829 --> 03:05:05.830]  Introducing Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[03:05:05.850 --> 03:05:10.673]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[03:05:10.793 --> 03:05:14.436]  Ultimate Bone Broth to help you save big on this new product and stock up.
[03:05:14.476 --> 03:05:16.937]  We're dropping the price to $19.95.
[03:05:17.197 --> 03:05:22.621]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients while keeping the cost low.
[03:05:22.761 --> 03:05:28.264]  Since we wanted to make sure that you got the best value possible, we've now switched to a new supplier with even better ingredients.
[03:05:28.364 --> 03:05:30.686]  That's why it's now the Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[03:05:32.807 --> 03:05:41.492]  Ultimate Bone Broth Formula include Chicken Bone Broth, Turmeric Root, Chaga Mushroom, Bee Pollen, Goji Berry, and Alfalfa Herb Powder.
[03:05:41.652 --> 03:05:42.752]  And even more, of course.
[03:05:42.912 --> 03:05:52.418]  These powerful ingredients are going to help you get the most out of your workout by supporting your healthy muscles, digestion, tendons, and ligaments, while also supporting your body's fight against free radicals.
[03:05:52.698 --> 03:05:59.741]  It's time to take advantage and pick up your bottle of an updated favorite formula with Ultimate Bone Broth from InfoWars Life.
[03:05:59.801 --> 03:06:00.202]  Thank you!
[03:06:14.099 --> 03:06:18.002]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:18.803 --> 03:06:21.765]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:06:22.246 --> 03:06:24.948]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:25.308 --> 03:06:35.136]  Okay, we're back and for the rest of the hour, I'm going to try to clear through the boards here on the phone calls.
[03:06:36.097 --> 03:06:43.163]  In the past, I've called into shows and I know how frustrating it can be to, you know, be listening to the show through your telephone for an hour or so.
[03:06:44.460 --> 03:06:46.841]  So let's go to Alex in Michigan first.
[03:06:47.101 --> 03:06:48.041]  Been waiting for an hour and a half.
[03:06:48.101 --> 03:06:49.021]  I think that's long enough.
[03:06:50.181 --> 03:06:50.942]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[03:06:52.122 --> 03:06:54.022]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, man.
[03:06:54.883 --> 03:06:58.743]  God bless you and God bless all the InfoWarriors out there.
[03:06:58.803 --> 03:06:59.444]  Merry Christmas.
[03:06:59.464 --> 03:07:02.184]  You bet.
[03:07:02.324 --> 03:07:12.587]  If you haven't already, go to the InfoWarriorsStore.com and buy yourself the X2 or the fish oil or the real red pill or the water filter.
[03:07:12.607 --> 03:07:13.227]  I think I need it.
[03:07:15.212 --> 03:07:15.412]  Yes.
[03:07:16.733 --> 03:07:19.874]  It'll be a great Christmas gift to everyone under the tree.
[03:07:19.934 --> 03:07:24.056]  Even if they're not InfoWars listeners, it'll be a great way to spread the word.
[03:07:25.137 --> 03:07:31.920]  And I think in relation to what you're talking about, it's not really a civil war, but it's an info war.
[03:07:32.240 --> 03:07:42.685]  And so our ammunition has to be information to counter their stupid narrative that we're Russian agents or Trump violated campaign finance law.
[03:07:44.859 --> 03:07:51.383]  Hillary allegedly got like 400 million from Bill Browder out of Russia, allegedly.
[03:07:51.403 --> 03:07:53.944]  So like, why is no one looking at that, you know?
[03:07:55.885 --> 03:07:59.127]  Yeah, in terms of this being an info war, you're absolutely right.
[03:07:59.607 --> 03:08:10.753]  But the problem is that we seem to be on divided tracks, like two parallel tunnels in the mountain that barely communicate and barely see each other's narrative.
[03:08:11.454 --> 03:08:15.097]  You know, people just choose the information path that they want.
[03:08:15.578 --> 03:08:21.043]  So for a while it was, you know, a fair fight on Twitter or Facebook, but we've seen how that went.
[03:08:21.243 --> 03:08:26.207]  And as soon as you get any traction, you know, you're shadow banned or you're just kicked off completely.
[03:08:27.028 --> 03:08:32.073]  I was kicked off of Twitter just for a burqa meme that didn't even name a religion.
[03:08:32.093 --> 03:08:36.677]  You know, some Muslim objected to a meme about burqas.
[03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:38.811]  And I was gone from Twitter.
[03:08:39.352 --> 03:08:43.757]  So I don't see how we can compete in the info war when we're only talking to our own audience.
[03:08:43.777 --> 03:08:46.301]  So that's one of my main concerns right now.
[03:08:47.242 --> 03:09:09.120]  I don't know if you have any ideas other than, I mean, I promote alternative social media like, you know, using BitChute and Brighteon instead of YouTube, which is Google, Gulag, or using Gab or FreeZoxy or other social media sites instead of just, you know, Facebook and Twitter.
[03:09:09.733 --> 03:09:17.816]  But those are such tiny audiences compared to the monoliths, the Leviathans of Google, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
[03:09:18.676 --> 03:09:24.338]  I don't see how we get any traction when our volumes are dialed down on the main social media sites.
[03:09:25.478 --> 03:09:29.119]  Maybe I'm in a depressed frame of mind right now, but I don't see us making progress.
[03:09:30.880 --> 03:09:31.620]  Do you have any ideas?
[03:09:32.972 --> 03:09:34.173]  Trump definitely needs to act.
[03:09:34.974 --> 03:09:39.397]  If we could all just sign up for a lawsuit like me, you, Alex Jones, everybody else, sign up.
[03:09:40.078 --> 03:09:44.722]  Infowars.com set something up where you all sign up for a lawsuit and we would totally win.
[03:09:45.522 --> 03:09:50.426]  And because that's the reason we might get into a civil war is because we can't get that we can't win the information war.
[03:09:50.466 --> 03:09:51.727]  So we go into a civil war.
[03:09:53.589 --> 03:09:59.894]  Yeah, if there's a if the only thing I can see Congress doing, and of course, the Democrats are going to run Congress now,
[03:10:00.825 --> 03:10:12.649]  No, if they even try to treat big social media as a utility and have the government running it, well, that just means eventually people like Ted Lieu will be writing the law.
[03:10:13.449 --> 03:10:19.591]  And, you know, I think it'll codify politically correct ideas.
[03:10:20.311 --> 03:10:22.632]  So I think that we need to
[03:10:23.889 --> 03:10:32.476]  You know, I don't know how we can work it, because any attempts to level the playing field on Facebook, I just see it working against us in the long run.
[03:10:34.420 --> 03:10:37.501]  You know, I wish that Trump would go and declassify everything in sight.
[03:10:37.541 --> 03:10:39.582]  I mean, gosh, I'd like to see the guy take the U.S.
[03:10:39.642 --> 03:10:47.184]  Marshals into the Department of Justice and force them to turn over documents, you know, to tell them, you know, you turn them over or you're going to be arrested.
[03:10:47.644 --> 03:10:56.467]  But it just shows that even a president of the United States has less power than the bureaucracy, the entrenched deep state.
[03:10:57.142 --> 03:11:04.707]  And they've got the media, they've got still most of the FBI, Department of Justice, the intel agencies, the man's up against everything.
[03:11:05.447 --> 03:11:09.010]  And you know, I guess sticking with Trump is the strongest thing we can do.
[03:11:09.050 --> 03:11:18.636]  But, but I'm at a loss for how to get more traction in the in the information war, of course, support info wars, you know, buy products from the store.
[03:11:19.236 --> 03:11:21.998]  But it seems like we're just talking to ourselves.
[03:11:22.118 --> 03:11:22.178]  And
[03:11:22.902 --> 03:11:27.605]  And, you know, big media and big social media is still dominating the country.
[03:11:28.826 --> 03:11:31.148]  Anyway, go ahead.
[03:11:32.268 --> 03:11:36.992]  If Trump could take military action, like arrest traitors, ideally.
[03:11:37.352 --> 03:11:42.515]  But if he, bare minimum, can't even get the information out with the FISA warrant, like you're talking about, like, that's not a good sign.
[03:11:42.956 --> 03:11:47.879]  Like, if he can't get the information out for ammunition in the Infowar, we have no shot.
[03:11:47.959 --> 03:11:49.240]  So he's got to do that at least.
[03:11:50.540 --> 03:12:00.342]  Yeah, I think that a big move, you know, he has to be assured that Mueller doesn't have any more big aces to play, then do the big declassification.
[03:12:01.403 --> 03:12:03.023]  But I don't know why he doesn't.
[03:12:03.083 --> 03:12:06.804]  I don't know what the grip is that they've got over him that he can't do that.
[03:12:07.644 --> 03:12:08.464]  But thanks, Alex.
[03:12:08.564 --> 03:12:14.526]  And let's go to Sean and PA, also been holding for a long time.
[03:12:14.806 --> 03:12:15.346]  Go ahead, Sean.
[03:12:17.182 --> 03:12:18.443]  Hey, Matt, thanks for hosting.
[03:12:18.463 --> 03:12:20.305]  You're literally my favorite guest host.
[03:12:21.266 --> 03:12:21.806]  Oh, thank you.
[03:12:24.108 --> 03:12:28.832]  The way that I see this is we elected Trump to get four years as president.
[03:12:29.272 --> 03:12:34.016]  We see the end of that race being when the deep state goes down.
[03:12:34.237 --> 03:12:37.559]  The Democrats see it as when Trump gets impeached.
[03:12:38.961 --> 03:12:42.784]  So the way that I'm thinking of this whole thing is that it's kind of a tortoise and a hare race.
[03:12:43.402 --> 03:12:45.603]  And that the Democrats are the hares.
[03:12:45.643 --> 03:12:49.564]  They're bouncing all over the place from one news story to the next, no matter how false it is.
[03:12:50.204 --> 03:12:54.345]  While Trump slowly marches along, you start lining everything up.
[03:12:54.425 --> 03:12:56.125]  There's moves, there's counter moves.
[03:12:56.605 --> 03:13:00.726]  And I'm still pretty positive that there's going to be some stuff happening.
[03:13:01.706 --> 03:13:08.648]  One thing in particular, which I'm not sure about, which I'd like to get your take on, is John Huber, Utah.
[03:13:09.628 --> 03:13:12.269]  There was some stuff, I don't know if you saw the testimony yesterday,
[03:13:12.987 --> 03:13:17.149]  But, you know, there are some things in there that were pretty enlightening.
[03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:23.793]  But at the same time, there was something that was pretty scary, that they said they had to give Huber's guys the information three times.
[03:13:24.113 --> 03:13:29.917]  Now, I don't know if that's government bureaucracy getting in the way, or if there's people even on Huber's team that are blocking things.
[03:13:30.477 --> 03:13:38.822]  But I'd like to get your take on his investigation, because we haven't really heard anything other than it exists, and they're looking at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:13:40.552 --> 03:13:46.574]  Yeah, there's been a few strings or parallel threads that we've been, you know, hoping on.
[03:13:47.294 --> 03:13:53.377]  One was that Jeff Sessions was just playing the quiet guy, but meanwhile, he was secretly stacking everything up.
[03:13:53.737 --> 03:13:55.957]  That turned out to be a total fantasy.
[03:13:56.398 --> 03:13:58.018]  The guy was a nothing.
[03:13:58.798 --> 03:13:59.579]  And then there's the
[03:14:03.948 --> 03:14:04.469]  What do you call it?
[03:14:04.489 --> 03:14:05.530]  The Inspector General.
[03:14:05.731 --> 03:14:07.533]  Oh, the Inspector General is going to do it.
[03:14:08.014 --> 03:14:09.956]  The Inspector General has no subpoena powers.
[03:14:09.997 --> 03:14:15.144]  He has no powers, really, other than what the DOJ wants to give him.
[03:14:16.099 --> 03:14:17.800]  And I don't see anything coming from that.
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:19.520]  Then there's old Huber's out there.
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:21.941]  He's got his own power.
[03:14:22.001 --> 03:14:24.202]  You know, maybe there are secret grand juries going on.
[03:14:25.742 --> 03:14:29.163]  I saw a couple of the regulars along Hannity last night.
[03:14:29.183 --> 03:14:30.544]  They seemed pretty optimistic.
[03:14:30.564 --> 03:14:35.946]  You know, Solomon Carter, the usual bunch, but nothing ever seems to come of it.
[03:14:36.366 --> 03:14:40.007]  I think that one thing that that Trump is doing that is strong, that's that's
[03:14:40.527 --> 03:14:45.310]  You know, really, a strong card to play is just the border.
[03:14:45.750 --> 03:14:51.573]  If Pelosi's going to go to shut down the government over no wall, I think that's a win for Trump.
[03:14:52.033 --> 03:14:53.134]  Just keep hammering that.
[03:14:53.534 --> 03:14:56.115]  I mean, gosh, where did Obama find $150 billion to give to Iran?
[03:14:56.135 --> 03:15:02.378]  They just pulled $150 billion out of the hat to give to Iran, and the Democrats won't give $5 billion for border security.
[03:15:10.211 --> 03:15:11.933]  And I'd be even more blunt than Trump.
[03:15:12.573 --> 03:15:15.696]  The Democrats want more illegal aliens.
[03:15:15.776 --> 03:15:21.981]  They want people coming into the country, you know, the dumber and the sicker and the better.
[03:15:22.101 --> 03:15:34.692]  Every person that sneaks into the country requires immediately federal government employees, that means the Democrats, you know, to support and assist them medically, with education, social services, everything.
[03:15:35.473 --> 03:15:41.716]  So, you know, I would keep beating on the drum of border security for as long as possible, as hard as possible.
[03:15:42.416 --> 03:15:46.137]  But as far as hoping for Huber, I don't see it.
[03:15:46.157 --> 03:15:53.300]  I've pretty much given up hope that there's some, like, it's like the Germans at the end of the war hoping for the super weapon, you know?
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:55.801]  Sooner or later, the super weapon is coming.
[03:15:56.461 --> 03:15:57.102]  It never came.
[03:15:58.397 --> 03:16:00.479]  Anyway, we'll be back after the break with more calls.
[03:16:21.141 --> 03:16:26.885]  Who said, hey, Donald Trump Jr., you better not tweet about how we had to eat the dogs of Venezuela, and how socialism doesn't work.
[03:16:27.305 --> 03:16:28.206]  We have subpoena power.
[03:16:28.226 --> 03:16:29.327]  We'll throw your ass in jail.
[03:16:29.487 --> 03:16:31.768]  And you've got them threatening to arrest Trump.
[03:16:32.088 --> 03:16:35.931]  There's no Russiagate stuff that, oh, did he pay off some bimbos 15 years ago.
[03:16:36.131 --> 03:16:38.453]  That's because these people can't win a real argument.
[03:16:38.473 --> 03:16:49.000]  They just want to come to America, these globalists, and their third-world populations, and basically conquer us, and then suck dry the goose that lays the golden eggs.
[03:16:49.940 --> 03:16:55.666]  The very same globalists have already exploited and oppressed the third world, and now they're here, pushing their attack on the First Amendment.
[03:16:55.967 --> 03:17:01.973]  And that's why you've seen George Soros' fund through Media Matters, through the other law firms, all these fake lawsuits against us.
[03:17:02.314 --> 03:17:10.863]  You've seen all these incredible fake headlines, taking out of context or editing what I've said, so that I'm saying incredibly insane things like there's secret Martian bases.
[03:17:11.944 --> 03:17:12.584]  ...was slaves.
[03:17:12.644 --> 03:17:13.365]  I never said that.
[03:17:13.805 --> 03:17:16.386]  So that they can then say, oh, he needs to be taken off the air.
[03:17:16.766 --> 03:17:23.068]  So first it's Apple, and then it's Google, and then it's YouTube, and now it's thousands of other conservatives and libertarians.
[03:17:23.088 --> 03:17:25.529]  Well, now they're going after talk radio.
[03:17:25.929 --> 03:17:30.170]  But talk radio has already been to the left, trying to stop talk radio being set up in the 80s.
[03:17:30.250 --> 03:17:34.332]  And they got rid of the Fairness Doctrine, the law that didn't let you have
[03:17:34.932 --> 03:17:35.572]  We're good to go.
[03:17:53.598 --> 03:17:57.661]  And now they're trying to get us off our local radio stations around the country.
[03:17:57.741 --> 03:18:03.446]  And they've picked, as the first one, one of our affiliates in Sacramento to go after them.
[03:18:03.466 --> 03:18:04.967]  We'll put up on screen a huge station.
[03:18:05.568 --> 03:18:06.809]  And you read what she says.
[03:18:06.869 --> 03:18:10.392]  She quotes all these things that I never said or I never did.
[03:18:11.172 --> 03:18:14.595]  And says that I engaged in a child endangerment promotion of violence.
[03:18:14.615 --> 03:18:16.256]  That's what YouTube took us off for.
[03:18:17.457 --> 03:18:22.420]  And major publications had to do retractions at the time because they said that I beat up a kid.
[03:18:22.901 --> 03:18:27.764]  It was ABC News footage of the big ten-year-old hitting adults and punching them.
[03:18:27.844 --> 03:18:30.726]  And he punches a guy four times and the guy pushes the kid down.
[03:18:31.046 --> 03:18:32.187]  They said that that was me!
[03:18:33.167 --> 03:18:35.268]  And so now, this is just one of the lies.
[03:18:35.288 --> 03:18:37.909]  And so she's saying she wants me taken off the air.
[03:18:38.569 --> 03:18:40.930]  And then she tells a bunch of lies and half-truths to do it.
[03:18:40.990 --> 03:18:46.472]  That's the definition of defamation, where you say, I want someone off the air, and so then you tell a bunch of lies.
[03:18:46.512 --> 03:18:52.674]  Like saying a restaurant, you know, puts dead baby parts in the soup and isn't true, or there's cockroaches in every, you know, bit of food.
[03:18:52.834 --> 03:18:54.454]  That's not true, because you want to shut them down.
[03:18:54.914 --> 03:18:56.795]  So that's what they're doing, period.
[03:18:57.135 --> 03:18:59.256]  And in my experience, this backfires
[03:18:59.696 --> 03:19:07.444]  When they try to bully talk radio stations because talk radio particularly understands the leftist, globalist agenda of Alexander Cortez and all of them.
[03:19:07.644 --> 03:19:08.785]  They want us all arrested!
[03:19:08.986 --> 03:19:09.987]  They want us all off air!
[03:19:10.287 --> 03:19:13.991]  So they're gonna misrepresent, out of context, sometimes just totally lie to do it.
[03:19:14.351 --> 03:19:15.752]  But that's why it's more important than ever.
[03:19:16.213 --> 03:19:21.558]  If you're watching on a TV station or cable station or listening to a local radio station, that you call them and you thank them for picking up the show.
[03:19:22.359 --> 03:19:25.821]  And you become a sponsor, or you let the sponsors know you appreciate it.
[03:19:25.861 --> 03:19:35.468]  And you tell your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube, or just your church, people at four-way stops, the grocery store, about that local radio station, or about that TV station, and you thank them.
[03:19:35.548 --> 03:19:38.890]  It's just that word of mouth versus these scumbags that really counts.
[03:19:38.910 --> 03:19:41.052]  You know, we sent our crew down to the border to cover the illegal caravan.
[03:19:41.612 --> 03:19:43.313]  And we had a bunch of antifas around our people.
[03:19:43.633 --> 03:19:44.574]  Where were the patriots down there?
[03:19:44.994 --> 03:19:47.596]  There are more of us than them, but we've got to get active and get involved.
[03:19:47.636 --> 03:19:51.979]  So their new front to kill the First Amendment is to shut down InfoWars and talk radio.
[03:19:52.399 --> 03:19:54.380]  I think it'll backfire, but it's up to you.
[03:20:04.447 --> 03:20:07.089]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:28.538 --> 03:20:34.199]  Great bumper music, but I'm about as far from a surfing safari mood as it can be.
[03:20:34.259 --> 03:20:40.360]  It's a cold, dreary, rainy day here, and it seems pretty bleak.
[03:20:40.761 --> 03:20:41.221]  I know things.
[03:20:41.281 --> 03:20:41.841]  I'll cheer up.
[03:20:41.901 --> 03:20:42.381]  Don't worry.
[03:20:42.401 --> 03:20:43.441]  I won't give up.
[03:20:44.121 --> 03:20:46.902]  But at the moment, I'm not in a great mood.
[03:20:47.422 --> 03:20:52.983]  Let's see if Chris in Tennessee can throw some brightness onto the matter.
[03:20:53.583 --> 03:20:54.323]  Go ahead, Chris.
[03:20:55.844 --> 03:20:56.104]  You there?
[03:20:56.144 --> 03:20:56.664]  Hey, Matt.
[03:20:57.524 --> 03:20:57.764]  Hey.
[03:20:58.978 --> 03:20:59.919]  I hope you're doing good.
[03:21:00.419 --> 03:21:08.006]  I know you're in bad spirits, but I hope you're still having time to have some fun and just relax despite everything that's going on.
[03:21:09.087 --> 03:21:10.268]  If it ever stops raining.
[03:21:10.288 --> 03:21:13.271]  Yeah, it's raining here too.
[03:21:13.511 --> 03:21:22.920]  I wanted to say this to Alex, but I love you too, so I'm going to go ahead and just spit it all off if you'll be so kind as to give me
[03:21:23.759 --> 03:21:25.741]  20 seconds to spout off my first two points.
[03:21:25.801 --> 03:21:28.643]  I want to get to my third one, which I feel like is very, very important.
[03:21:29.724 --> 03:21:29.964]  Sure.
[03:21:29.984 --> 03:21:31.845]  Go ahead.
[03:21:31.906 --> 03:21:36.549]  Number one, there's some great deals going on right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:21:36.709 --> 03:21:42.234]  I just bought about, I spent less than a hundred dollars on $250 worth of product.
[03:21:43.134 --> 03:21:44.495]  Got a free t-shirt with it too.
[03:21:45.376 --> 03:21:47.418]  So I urge all the listeners to go check that out.
[03:21:48.218 --> 03:21:48.658]  Number two,
[03:21:51.044 --> 03:21:56.185]  I had the pleasure of re-watching the movie Waking Life, the Richard Linklater movie.
[03:21:58.626 --> 03:22:04.367]  Holy moly, that is a great movie, and Alex Jones has a fantastic rant in that movie.
[03:22:05.107 --> 03:22:11.028]  I urge everybody to just go check that movie out, and a healthy dose of cannabis is not going to hurt the experience.
[03:22:11.109 --> 03:22:11.409]  It's great.
[03:22:18.620 --> 03:22:22.382]  Well, I mean, yeah, only if it's in a legal state.
[03:22:22.563 --> 03:22:24.043]  If it's in a legal state, do it.
[03:22:25.224 --> 03:22:44.215]  But, you know, my last point, and I do feel like this is super important, and I hope Alex and Gavin and Anthony Cumia or somebody needs to get this message to the Met because when...
[03:22:46.407 --> 03:22:50.529]  Everybody I know under the age of 35 listens to the Joe Rogan Experience.
[03:22:51.330 --> 03:22:53.971]  He's basically bigger than Oprah, in my opinion.
[03:22:55.832 --> 03:22:57.373]  I think that's an arguable fact.
[03:22:57.433 --> 03:23:00.695]  Joe Rogan's podcast is bigger than Oprah ever was.
[03:23:02.236 --> 03:23:10.340]  I think that Alex and Owen Benjamin and Gavin and anybody else who's friends with Rogan
[03:23:11.747 --> 03:23:22.613]  Needs to really get on his butt about getting Alex on, getting Gavin back on, because I know so many people that listen to that podcast.
[03:23:22.713 --> 03:23:25.354]  And we're talking about a culture war, an information war.
[03:23:25.795 --> 03:23:30.877]  That's a big platform for Alex or Gavin or whoever to get their message across.
[03:23:31.838 --> 03:23:33.739]  And we have a real problem where, uh,
[03:23:36.641 --> 03:23:44.867]  Like Alex and you have been talking about, we seem to be kind of in an echo chamber right now, and that's a big platform for them to get their ideas across.
[03:23:45.908 --> 03:23:50.232]  And I know even, uh, I don't know if you heard it, but Anthony Cumia was just on Rogan.
[03:23:51.352 --> 03:23:54.014]  And you could tell Joe really looks up to Rogan.
[03:23:54.275 --> 03:23:56.216]  I mean, Joe really looks up to Anthony Cumia.
[03:23:58.038 --> 03:24:04.883]  And, uh, I think all those, all that group of guys really need to just start bugging Joe, just start hassling like, Hey,
[03:24:05.771 --> 03:24:07.713]  Like, you say you're our friend.
[03:24:08.753 --> 03:24:10.455]  You really need to, like, have us on.
[03:24:11.255 --> 03:24:12.096]  Especially Alex.
[03:24:12.136 --> 03:24:13.917]  Like, Alex needs to get back on Joe Rogan.
[03:24:13.937 --> 03:24:15.699]  I know he announced that podcast a while ago.
[03:24:15.739 --> 03:24:16.479]  He needs to get back.
[03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:23.125]  He needs to, like, really have Anthony Cumia and Owen Benjamin just get on Joe's butt and get back on there.
[03:24:23.165 --> 03:24:25.607]  Because that's where we're going to win the culture war.
[03:24:26.829 --> 03:24:30.030]  All of all of these, you know, programming kind of decisions.
[03:24:30.090 --> 03:24:35.971]  That's, you know, I'm sure that's heard up the chain of command, but that's, you know, that's way over my pay grade.
[03:24:36.051 --> 03:24:41.712]  I really don't know about all the ins and outs of who's in with who and who's out with who.
[03:24:42.292 --> 03:24:45.813]  You know, I don't like the squabbling on our side.
[03:24:45.833 --> 03:24:55.295]  I know there's there's sometimes, you know, all kind of factors I'm not privy to, but in general, you know, if you haven't, if you have a choice between.
[03:24:56.169 --> 03:25:02.795]  Watching somebody's video or podcast, try to stay, it's difficult because it's so convenient.
[03:25:02.895 --> 03:25:13.345]  Of course, it's very convenient to use YouTube, but try to find other places, you know, like Brighteon, BitChute, Zoxy, things like that.
[03:25:13.885 --> 03:25:19.911]  Try to find and encourage podcasters, you know, not to just
[03:25:20.663 --> 03:25:22.524]  Make the easy way, which is YouTube.
[03:25:23.424 --> 03:25:26.905]  Encourage people to to use alternative social media.
[03:25:27.425 --> 03:25:30.906]  It's the only way I think we're going to eventually make a dent if it's even possible.
[03:25:31.706 --> 03:25:33.487]  But yeah.
[03:25:33.587 --> 03:25:33.927]  I haven't.
[03:25:34.127 --> 03:25:36.588]  I haven't been listening to Joe Rogan lately.
[03:25:36.988 --> 03:25:43.130]  You know, I'm obviously not a millennial, but yeah, it's it's a good idea.
[03:25:43.190 --> 03:25:44.770]  I'll have to check it out.
[03:25:45.551 --> 03:25:46.131]  Thanks a lot.
[03:25:47.551 --> 03:25:48.872]  Justin in California.
[03:25:49.492 --> 03:25:50.232]  You hanging on there?
[03:25:51.685 --> 03:25:53.326]  You're on the Culture War?
[03:25:53.346 --> 03:25:53.986]  Go ahead, Justin.
[03:25:54.006 --> 03:25:55.567]  Thank you for taking my call on that.
[03:25:56.808 --> 03:26:05.392]  Yeah, I was just echoing with what you said earlier, you know, I think the Civil War's coming too, but I think one way that we can stop it is get more of a voice in pop culture, you know?
[03:26:06.413 --> 03:26:12.776]  It was really great to see, like, the last caller, he was bringing up the Joe Rogan Show, and I wanted to mention that as well, you know?
[03:26:12.836 --> 03:26:17.558]  It was really great to see Shooter Jennings on the Joe Rogan Show really go to bat for Alex, you know?
[03:26:17.978 --> 03:26:21.180]  And I know Shooter, I went to a lot of his shows, and
[03:26:21.621 --> 03:26:31.567]  I hung out with him a few times, and Shooter's a really great guy, and it was really great to see him really speaking out for Alex and saying, you know, we need to all back up the First Amendment.
[03:26:32.307 --> 03:26:37.771]  And for him to go on that show and make that statement, it was really big.
[03:26:37.851 --> 03:26:46.856]  So I think a lot more of Alex's audience should reach out and support people like Shooter Jennings, people that are coming to bat for our side, you know?
[03:26:47.512 --> 03:26:53.273]  Um, you know, I think I work for a certain government agency, sir, and I'm CSR.
[03:26:53.293 --> 03:26:55.034]  There's a customer service representative.
[03:26:55.574 --> 03:27:01.856]  I take a lot of calls from a lot of college kids, and these kids are just really, really ignorant and have no clue what's going on.
[03:27:02.276 --> 03:27:03.636]  Zero life experience.
[03:27:03.976 --> 03:27:11.498]  I think if we really could get something in pop culture that could show that our side, you know, our side, our views and our opinion,
[03:27:12.337 --> 03:27:18.058]  And not make it look out to be stupid or racist or xenophobic or whatever words they want to put on.
[03:27:18.578 --> 03:27:21.499]  You know that when they attack, you know the more conservative side.
[03:27:21.899 --> 03:27:29.101]  I think if we, you know, really support these voices that are going to bat for us and make them bigger stars, you know that's going to help our side as well.
[03:27:31.361 --> 03:27:33.541]  Yeah, I don't know how that's accomplished.
[03:27:33.641 --> 03:27:33.921]  You know.
[03:27:34.782 --> 03:27:36.542]  I've been fighting this culture war for years.
[03:27:36.602 --> 03:27:40.003]  My first novel, you know, is 15 years old.
[03:27:41.812 --> 03:27:45.136]  People for years have been saying they should be made into movies.
[03:27:45.797 --> 03:27:46.598]  My books, you know?
[03:27:46.778 --> 03:27:50.323]  This is my own fighting in the culture war.
[03:27:50.783 --> 03:27:54.308]  But it's hard to get traction when everything is lined up towards the left.
[03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:58.954]  Anything that starts to get traction, you know, you get kicked off of Twitter.
[03:28:00.248 --> 03:28:02.310]  But I mean, we keep fighting.
[03:28:02.550 --> 03:28:05.773]  I wish that I wish there were movie producers out there.
[03:28:05.814 --> 03:28:06.995]  There have been a few in the past.
[03:28:07.515 --> 03:28:09.017]  There are great movies that could be made.
[03:28:10.178 --> 03:28:11.279]  Television shows, too.
[03:28:11.339 --> 03:28:14.782]  But I don't see I don't see the funding for it.
[03:28:14.942 --> 03:28:18.266]  Everybody talks about these things, but the money never comes through.
[03:28:18.286 --> 03:28:18.326]  So.
[03:28:20.333 --> 03:28:28.684]  You know, I think that alternative social media, it's the only place we've got, you know, you can make videos that won't be banned.
[03:28:28.764 --> 03:28:33.591]  And what they said, YouTube has taken off like 50 million videos in the last year.
[03:28:34.355 --> 03:28:36.656]  They just put the thumb down and you're gone.
[03:28:37.016 --> 03:28:42.017]  So how can you reach a mass culture audience when your videos are taken down?
[03:28:42.457 --> 03:28:50.699]  And then you have to self-censor to keep it so that they'll not just kick it off of YouTube.
[03:28:50.739 --> 03:28:58.001]  Mark Dice can't even say the word that got Morning Joe in trouble.
[03:28:58.021 --> 03:28:59.581]  He's afraid to say that word.
[03:28:59.601 --> 03:29:00.302]  It's ridiculous.
[03:29:04.867 --> 03:29:10.908]  Let me show you how the globalists push propaganda to convince the human race to commit suicide.
[03:29:11.168 --> 03:29:23.310]  For years anyone who dared mention the word chemtrails was mocked as a lunatic or a conspiracy theorist and now the synonymous term geoengineering is found throughout the scientific literature.
[03:29:23.390 --> 03:29:34.052]  You see it advocated by scientists now on a daily basis as a solution to climate change and global warming and they are openly advocating the spraying of the atmosphere with pollutants.
[03:29:34.252 --> 03:29:36.733]  In order to dim the sun and they say save the planet.
[03:29:36.753 --> 03:29:46.999]  It's called Stratospheric Aerosol Injection and there are now published scientific studies that propose thousands of flights a year and releasing millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere.
[03:29:47.119 --> 03:29:52.402]  They are now conducting and advocating what's called Stratospheric Aerosol Injection.
[03:29:52.702 --> 03:29:53.603]  S-A-I.
[03:29:53.803 --> 03:30:00.727]  And this is basically the new science-y sounding term for what most people would call chemtrails or geoengineering.
[03:30:00.887 --> 03:30:02.928]  And in this science paper they proposed
[03:30:03.308 --> 03:30:21.852]  Spraying at very high altitudes sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere in order to dim the Sun They want to partially block out the Sun and they propose building an entire new fleet of aircraft with Specialization just to spray this pollution all around the world now you and I would call sulfur dioxide small
[03:30:22.152 --> 03:30:26.494]  And even the EPA says that sulfur dioxide is a toxin and makes it difficult to breathe.
[03:30:26.674 --> 03:30:30.076]  If you have enough sulfur dioxide in the air, you will asphyxiate and die.
[03:30:30.136 --> 03:30:33.337]  In fact, all mammals will, because sulfur dioxide is a poison.
[03:30:33.438 --> 03:30:35.539]  So why are they altering the atmosphere?
[03:30:35.659 --> 03:30:45.623]  Why are they wanting to spray this by running 4,000 flights a year, with a proposed cost of $2.25 billion a year, in order to spray this pollution into the upper atmosphere?
[03:30:45.703 --> 03:30:48.705]  The answer is, terraforming operations are underway.
[03:30:48.845 --> 03:30:50.866]  They are terraforming planet Earth.
[03:30:51.466 --> 03:30:52.807]  They're altering the atmosphere.
[03:30:52.928 --> 03:31:02.476]  And if you look at the implications of this sun dimming, this global dimming that they want to create, the implications are catastrophic for the survival of the human race.
[03:31:02.776 --> 03:31:07.380]  One of them that you need to know right up front is the depletion of oxygen from the atmosphere.
[03:31:07.521 --> 03:31:11.965]  Currently, oxygen levels, you could say, are roughly at about 20% at sea level.
[03:31:12.085 --> 03:31:14.647]  Those oxygen levels will plummet because global
[03:31:14.667 --> 03:31:22.091]  Global dimming will harm the photosynthesis metabolism, you could say, of plants that produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis.
[03:31:22.211 --> 03:31:27.154]  This oxygen depletion will, if allowed to continue, it will asphyxiate humans.
[03:31:27.394 --> 03:31:32.416]  It will create Earth as a habitat that is not survivable by human beings.
[03:31:32.476 --> 03:31:34.077]  They're altering the atmosphere.
[03:31:34.157 --> 03:31:35.358]  They're altering our planet.
[03:31:35.518 --> 03:31:37.019]  They are terraforming planet Earth.
[03:31:37.119 --> 03:31:42.662]  The globalists know that the most effective way to destroy humanity, and literally exterminate the human race, is to cut off the oxygen.
[03:31:42.802 --> 03:31:44.123]  And that's what this plan is doing.
[03:31:44.203 --> 03:31:55.950]  So if you spray sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, and you keep doing it enough, you dim the sun, and just a review here, you dim the sun, you slow the metabolism of plants, plants produce less oxygen, oxygen levels drop.
[03:31:56.651 --> 03:31:58.312]  The world asphyxiates.
[03:31:59.372 --> 03:32:02.094]  If you continue that enough, and that is part of the plan.
[03:32:02.294 --> 03:32:03.755]  This is why I call this terraforming.
[03:32:03.795 --> 03:32:05.816]  You have to pollute the planet to save the planet.
[03:32:05.836 --> 03:32:07.177]  Well, that makes no sense, does it?
[03:32:07.237 --> 03:32:10.019]  When they say climate change, it's because they want to change the climate.
[03:32:10.119 --> 03:32:11.300]  They want to change the atmosphere.
[03:32:11.320 --> 03:32:14.442]  They want to chemically alter the atmosphere and exterminate human beings.
[03:32:14.482 --> 03:32:18.405]  So we are fighting for much more than just geopolitical liberty.
[03:32:18.465 --> 03:32:20.286]  We're fighting for the future of the human race.
[03:32:20.526 --> 03:32:25.329]  They want to murder every human being on the planet and they figured out how to do it.
[03:32:25.409 --> 03:32:29.172]  They convinced the millennials and the liberals that poisoning the planet is saving the planet.
[03:32:29.172 --> 03:32:29.652]  We're good to go.
[03:33:05.330 --> 03:33:08.051]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.554 --> 03:33:27.835]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.375 --> 03:33:31.756]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:35.018 --> 03:33:40.763]  Okay, I'm looking at the board and I see a lot of patient people on hold.
[03:33:41.965 --> 03:33:47.169]  Let's go to Clinton, Texas, who also has an idea about the upcoming Civil War.
[03:33:47.490 --> 03:33:48.170]  Clint, are you there?
[03:33:49.071 --> 03:33:49.952]  Yes, sir, I am.
[03:33:51.333 --> 03:33:56.718]  First of all, I just want to say thank you and everybody for all you're all trying to do.
[03:33:57.779 --> 03:33:58.220]  It's hard.
[03:34:00.504 --> 03:34:05.346]  You know, actually, I was listening to you while I was working and I stopped what I was doing.
[03:34:05.366 --> 03:34:10.668]  You know, I think you're absolutely right.
[03:34:10.748 --> 03:34:13.729]  There's going to be no way out of the Civil War.
[03:34:15.689 --> 03:34:16.730]  It's just inevitable.
[03:34:18.270 --> 03:34:25.233]  I like to be optimistic, but you know how the funniest things like to go on during the holidays and people don't pay attention.
[03:34:26.353 --> 03:34:29.334]  That's, I don't know, something about
[03:34:30.120 --> 03:34:40.908]  This Christmas holiday, as you know how you have that gut feeling, that gut instinct that just, you know, gets at you?
[03:34:41.509 --> 03:34:51.537]  Well, you know, I think honestly, they're going to, you know, either one, crash the stock market either right during the holidays or right after.
[03:34:51.557 --> 03:34:58.182]  Number two, during that time, I feel that something's going to happen to our president.
[03:34:58.937 --> 03:35:03.660]  And number three, it'll ultimately just lead to a civil war scenario.
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:07.282]  That's just kind of how it all seems to be playing out.
[03:35:07.322 --> 03:35:08.283]  I could be totally wrong.
[03:35:08.743 --> 03:35:09.404]  What are your thoughts?
[03:35:10.424 --> 03:35:23.272]  Yeah, I think that the deep state plotters, you know, Brennan, Clapper, Mueller, and all of their minions and lackeys, I think that they're amazed that Trump is still still standing.
[03:35:23.512 --> 03:35:24.513]  You know, the guy's got
[03:35:25.327 --> 03:35:36.373]  Got skin thicker than a rhinoceros and they're shooting at him and they thought he would be down long ago and he's still at, you know, he's still standing strong.
[03:35:36.973 --> 03:35:44.497]  So I think that there will be some people out there that will just say, look, the only way we're going to get rid of this guy is to get rid of him.
[03:35:45.538 --> 03:35:49.260]  And you know, maybe it'll be some kind of a plausible accident.
[03:35:49.340 --> 03:35:53.122]  I always worry about airplanes and helicopters, things like that.
[03:35:54.308 --> 03:36:01.471]  Or maybe it won't, but I'll guarantee you some of these deep state people, they're very, they're very panicked.
[03:36:02.012 --> 03:36:08.775]  And it's not just Democrats, you know, Trump being such an outsider, he threatens to expose a lot of corruption.
[03:36:09.435 --> 03:36:11.896]  And the corruption is not only among the Democrats.
[03:36:12.636 --> 03:36:18.759]  So there are entrenched forces that have been on all kinds of corrupt gravy trains for decades.
[03:36:19.528 --> 03:36:25.111]  And Trump is really a danger to that status quo, and they would like to see him get, you know, gone.
[03:36:25.771 --> 03:36:28.413]  As far as the stock market, of course, it's inevitable.
[03:36:29.093 --> 03:36:35.837]  But are there people, you know, George Soros, et cetera, who would, who would if they could swing the market to cause it to crash?
[03:36:36.537 --> 03:36:36.977]  No doubt.
[03:36:37.117 --> 03:36:40.259]  And if and when this happens, and it's a recession is inevitable.
[03:36:41.019 --> 03:36:43.160]  When it happens, they're going to blame Trump 100%.
[03:36:44.637 --> 03:36:53.323]  So just as the while the economy's been strong and unemployment numbers and so forth have been strong, the media doesn't say a word to give him credit.
[03:36:54.063 --> 03:36:58.606]  But if the economy crashes, you can bet he's going to get 100% of the blame.
[03:36:59.346 --> 03:37:02.689]  And you can see that there are, there are still things happening.
[03:37:03.329 --> 03:37:09.393]  Like this, this Chinese businesswoman that was arrested in Canada, this, the arrest was made
[03:37:10.146 --> 03:37:14.749]  I think while Trump was actually speaking to her meeting with the Chinese, and I don't think he knew about it.
[03:37:14.789 --> 03:37:24.995]  I think this is a complete, this is a shot at Trump showing that, you know, the deep state can still like meddle in international affairs.
[03:37:25.055 --> 03:37:35.602]  This is a very huge woman in China that was arrested basically while changing flights, changing planes in Canada, and she was grabbed.
[03:37:36.263 --> 03:37:46.972]  You know, this imagine, you know, like a Steve Jobs, somebody were, you know, a boss ahead of Facebook or Google being arrested, changing planes in Hong Kong.
[03:37:47.352 --> 03:37:50.534]  And then, you know, this is a huge news in China.
[03:37:50.574 --> 03:37:51.495]  It's not in America.
[03:37:52.016 --> 03:37:56.859]  But, you know, the deep state is actively meddling and trying to take out Trump.
[03:37:56.940 --> 03:38:02.784]  And, and I think that it's going to continue and get worse, especially if there's any kind of a market crash.
[03:38:03.144 --> 03:38:04.065]  He's going to be blamed 100%.
[03:38:05.481 --> 03:38:06.542]  Yeah, Debbie.
[03:38:07.282 --> 03:38:09.163]  Yeah, thanks Clint.
[03:38:10.103 --> 03:38:12.665]  Debbie in New Jersey been waiting a long time.
[03:38:13.425 --> 03:38:14.065]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[03:38:14.085 --> 03:38:14.906]  What did you want to say?
[03:38:15.326 --> 03:38:19.128]  First, I want to say Merry Christmas to all you guys and especially you, Matt.
[03:38:19.428 --> 03:38:19.668]  Thanks.
[03:38:19.928 --> 03:38:20.689]  Please cheer up.
[03:38:20.709 --> 03:38:24.371]  I want you to know I was married to an outlaw biker.
[03:38:24.451 --> 03:38:25.932]  It would help if the sun came out.
[03:38:26.672 --> 03:38:26.872]  Go ahead.
[03:38:26.892 --> 03:38:27.652]  Don't worry, it will.
[03:38:28.253 --> 03:38:28.553]  It will.
[03:38:28.873 --> 03:38:30.574]  Okay.
[03:38:32.235 --> 03:38:34.416]  If the deep state does not think
[03:38:35.376 --> 03:38:44.702]  That the outlaw bikers, hell's angels in this country, I was married to one, is going to stand by and let these sons of bitches take this country over?
[03:38:45.083 --> 03:38:46.964]  They are sadly mistaken.
[03:38:47.965 --> 03:38:49.306]  I have first-hand knowledge.
[03:38:49.366 --> 03:38:52.588]  I know for a fact these guys are going to step up to the plate.
[03:38:53.188 --> 03:39:00.073]  Not only that, I have a summer home in Hebron, Maryland, where the biggest militia is.
[03:39:01.294 --> 03:39:02.755]  And I have plenty of friends down there.
[03:39:04.079 --> 03:39:08.742]  People are going to stand up, people are ready, and they are silently waiting.
[03:39:10.924 --> 03:39:17.089]  Everybody should know, have faith, prepare yourself, don't be afraid.
[03:39:17.789 --> 03:39:19.831]  We're here in New Jersey and we're not afraid.
[03:39:19.851 --> 03:39:24.154]  They come to this door, well they'll have to take us out in a body bag if we lose.
[03:39:24.454 --> 03:39:26.796]  But I do not plan on going to prison, I'll tell you that.
[03:39:29.141 --> 03:39:44.984]  Well, I appreciate that spirit, but I think most people, as long as there's electricity, food in the refrigerator, their smartphone is charged up and has all the latest apps, I don't think they really care what happens politically.
[03:39:46.024 --> 03:39:47.644]  It's hard to motivate people.
[03:39:47.964 --> 03:39:55.946]  Concepts like freedom of speech, what does that matter to people that are just watching viral videos all day, playing video games?
[03:39:56.778 --> 03:40:04.143]  You know, as long as the power is on and they're not hungry, I think that they'll accept almost anything politically.
[03:40:05.784 --> 03:40:19.132]  But what comes after a civil war is almost surely going to be some form of economic collapse, you know, cut off of, you know, imagine just if the truckers went on a strike, for example.
[03:40:19.841 --> 03:40:27.686]  Or imagine if something happened that that food and diesel fuel weren't being distributed because it was too dangerous to drive down the highway.
[03:40:27.706 --> 03:40:32.669]  You know, in a modern civil war, the infrastructure is just too vulnerable.
[03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:40.853]  Any aggrieved party, any small splinter group can pretty much shut down the freeways, you know, without being too graphic.
[03:40:40.934 --> 03:40:44.756]  It's not rocket science to imagine how this can happen.
[03:40:45.356 --> 03:40:46.957]  But then everybody suffers.
[03:40:47.117 --> 03:40:48.298]  Once everybody is suffering,
[03:40:48.883 --> 03:40:53.706]  The media will then portray, you know, the patriotic side as terrorists.
[03:40:53.806 --> 03:40:54.927]  It's, you know, predictable.
[03:40:55.667 --> 03:40:58.168]  And, you know, then I guess we'll be in it.
[03:40:58.789 --> 03:41:00.310]  We'll just have to see what happens then.
[03:41:00.350 --> 03:41:03.231]  But I don't want to see anybody carried out in body bags.
[03:41:03.271 --> 03:41:10.055]  I wish we could raise awareness about our, you know, our steadily diminishing freedoms short of that.
[03:41:10.155 --> 03:41:12.417]  But, you know, we'll just have to see.
[03:41:14.258 --> 03:41:15.058]  Allen, Texas.
[03:41:15.438 --> 03:41:16.379]  So a war vet.
[03:41:17.139 --> 03:41:17.660]  Go ahead, Al.
[03:41:21.065 --> 03:41:29.647]  I want to talk specifically to the people who are getting very frustrated and saying that we have to, or that we will, move to a revolution.
[03:41:30.227 --> 03:41:34.969]  You know, when you're old enough to remember World War II, it gives you a perspective.
[03:41:35.549 --> 03:41:41.370]  I have personally witnessed every political revolution of the 20th century, not including the Bolshevik Revolution.
[03:41:42.392 --> 03:41:44.593]  They are notoriously counterproductive.
[03:41:44.633 --> 03:41:49.214]  You always end up with something far worse than you overthrew.
[03:41:49.914 --> 03:41:52.475]  And I'm looking at where we stand.
[03:41:52.515 --> 03:41:54.196]  We've got a couple years left with Trump.
[03:41:54.836 --> 03:41:58.237]  He seems to me to be remarkably incompetent.
[03:41:59.537 --> 03:42:00.418]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:42:01.078 --> 03:42:05.439]  He's going to be gone by nothing other than the operation of term limits.
[03:42:05.719 --> 03:42:06.520]  He's going to be gone.
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:07.660]  And what have we got?
[03:42:08.060 --> 03:42:10.941]  We've got a bunch of old people like me who don't matter because we're dying.
[03:42:11.877 --> 03:42:18.801]  The only people who matter are the young people, and half of the young people do not want the United States to continue.
[03:42:19.682 --> 03:42:32.609]  Do these revolutionaries, these self-appointed pro-revolutionaries, seriously expect me to violently attack my children, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren?
[03:42:32.629 --> 03:42:33.209]  No, I can't see it.
[03:42:33.229 --> 03:42:35.190]  Because if you do, you are mistaken.
[03:42:35.311 --> 03:42:35.931]  I will not do it.
[03:42:36.972 --> 03:42:37.732]  Yeah, okay.
[03:42:38.092 --> 03:42:38.592]  Thanks, Al.
[03:42:38.893 --> 03:42:40.974]  That's the long term of history.
[03:42:41.747 --> 03:42:46.989]  Yeah, nobody's going to win in a civil war, and like you said, it usually winds up worse, you know.
[03:42:47.009 --> 03:42:54.211]  The French Revolution went from guillotines to Napoleon, and that seems to be a historical pattern.
[03:42:55.331 --> 03:42:57.052]  Anyway, we'll see you on the other side of the break.
[03:43:02.192 --> 03:43:03.612]  2018 has come and it's almost gone.
[03:43:03.632 --> 03:43:06.313]  And it's been one incredible year.
[03:43:06.353 --> 03:43:07.554]  It's been a serious fight.
[03:43:08.114 --> 03:43:12.396]  But nationalism and populism and Christianity are coming back across the world.
[03:43:12.416 --> 03:43:16.737]  Thanks to God shining through you and your family.
[03:43:16.917 --> 03:43:18.638]  Thanks to you taking action.
[03:43:18.658 --> 03:43:21.839]  So I want to thank you for what you've done.
[03:43:22.620 --> 03:43:27.202]  You are literally the strength, the blood, the guts, the wind in our sails.
[03:43:27.622 --> 03:43:27.962]  Literally.
[03:43:29.059 --> 03:43:30.840]  So I want to salute you and thank you for what you've done.
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:40.605]  And I want to encourage you to get great products like the supplements and the water filtration, the air filtration, the Patriot apparel, all of it, at InfoWareStore.com.

[03:43:45.907 --> 03:43:47.448]  Don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds.

[03:43:55.452 --> 03:43:55.792]  Help us
[03:43:57.435 --> 03:44:02.346]  Stand against George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the globalists.
[03:44:02.607 --> 03:44:03.028]  Help us!
[03:44:04.554 --> 03:44:07.355]  Stand in the way of their plans and their operations.
[03:44:07.475 --> 03:44:19.701]  At the same time, getting amazing products like BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and X2 and X3 of Suprametal Vitality, and Brain Force, and Lung Cleanse, and Knockout, and Alpha Power, and so many other amazing products.
[03:44:20.201 --> 03:44:24.683]  Whatever the best products are, we do the research, and that's what we bring you, because we want to work for you.
[03:44:25.003 --> 03:44:26.844]  We want it to be amazing, so you order it again.
[03:44:27.184 --> 03:44:29.045]  We treat you just like we want to be treated.
[03:44:29.565 --> 03:44:31.646]  Because we respect you, and we appreciate you.
[03:44:31.927 --> 03:44:37.811]  You know, the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you, and the Christ rule, lay down your life for others.
[03:44:38.731 --> 03:44:39.992]  Is that the world you want to live in?
[03:44:40.432 --> 03:44:44.495]  With a bunch of heroes, people that are ready to fight and stand up, instead of a bunch of backstabbing cowards?
[03:44:45.256 --> 03:44:47.117]  That's the world that builds civilization.
[03:44:47.157 --> 03:44:48.378]  That's the world that builds it all.
[03:44:48.678 --> 03:44:53.041]  So when I treat you like I want to be treated, it's because I respect myself and I respect you.
[03:44:53.541 --> 03:44:54.542]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:44:54.762 --> 03:44:55.462]  Biggest sales ever.
[03:44:55.502 --> 03:44:57.724]  Free shipping storewide, and so much more.
[03:44:57.744 --> 03:44:58.584]  But it's your last chance.
[03:44:58.624 --> 03:44:59.185]  Please take action.
[03:45:00.714 --> 03:45:07.184]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:45:08.887 --> 03:45:10.349]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:45:10.589 --> 03:45:14.355]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double-paid reappoints.
[03:45:16.664 --> 03:45:22.613]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:45:23.374 --> 03:45:31.046]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free colloidal silver iodine fortified super blue that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[03:45:31.807 --> 03:45:57.962]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[03:45:59.198 --> 03:46:05.522]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[03:46:05.982 --> 03:46:07.723]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[03:46:07.783 --> 03:46:12.726]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[03:46:13.187 --> 03:46:13.747]  It's big.
[03:46:14.227 --> 03:46:14.648]  It's bad.
[03:46:15.068 --> 03:46:20.291]  So, we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[03:46:20.311 --> 03:46:22.612]  You know, they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[03:46:23.053 --> 03:46:26.255]  So, to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[03:46:26.855 --> 03:46:27.818]  Storewide free shipping.
[03:46:27.838 --> 03:46:29.022]  That's been going on for over a month.
[03:46:29.784 --> 03:46:31.028]  50 to 75% off.
[03:46:31.048 --> 03:46:32.051]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[03:46:33.117 --> 03:46:34.058]  The Double Patriot points.
[03:46:34.078 --> 03:46:34.998]  That's what's happening in about a week.
[03:46:35.338 --> 03:46:41.962]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[03:46:42.423 --> 03:46:46.805]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:46.845 --> 03:46:48.706]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:46:48.967 --> 03:46:50.788]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:46:50.988 --> 03:46:53.029]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:53.209 --> 03:46:57.231]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:47:04.648 --> 03:47:09.172]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.875 --> 03:47:17.438]  The great Ennio Morricone.
[03:47:17.458 --> 03:47:18.959]  What a genius.
[03:47:19.099 --> 03:47:19.780]  Anyway...
[03:47:32.685 --> 03:47:38.290]  I'm going to take the remaining calls in this last segment, and they're going to have to be short so I can get to everybody.
[03:47:38.570 --> 03:47:45.576]  And what I'll do is just let you make a comment, speak for a minute or two, and then we'll go to the next call.
[03:47:46.817 --> 03:47:48.839]  I see a Dr. Kelly in California.
[03:47:49.787 --> 03:47:51.569]  Are you there still, Dr. Kelly?
[03:47:51.809 --> 03:47:54.552]  Thank you so much for taking my call and I will make it quick.
[03:47:54.712 --> 03:48:08.324]  I'd like to point out that the people that are senators such as Feinstein, Harris and several of the politicians are sitting bar attorneys in their respective states.
[03:48:08.545 --> 03:48:11.908]  I'd like people to look into that and to expose that
[03:48:13.060 --> 03:48:18.904]  And we've got Will Wagner, who exposed the original 13th Amendment from 1811.
[03:48:18.944 --> 03:48:24.788]  And there are so many wonderful works to read in your local law library.
[03:48:25.629 --> 03:48:30.072]  And document it, teach your kids, and thank you, Matt, for your work.
[03:48:31.993 --> 03:48:32.573]  Thank you.
[03:48:32.953 --> 03:48:37.376]  That whole vote harvesting thing out in Orange County, that's really got me freaked out.
[03:48:37.416 --> 03:48:38.937]  That's so Venezuela.
[03:48:39.077 --> 03:48:41.199]  It's just almost beyond belief.
[03:48:42.274 --> 03:48:47.115]  Next, it's going to be, you know, people's cadres collecting the votes and filling them out for you.
[03:48:48.255 --> 03:48:51.756]  Matt in Ohio wants to talk about a coming crash.
[03:48:51.896 --> 03:48:52.556]  Matt, are you there?
[03:48:52.576 --> 03:48:54.876]  Hey, how's it going, Matt?
[03:48:55.996 --> 03:48:56.216]  Great.
[03:48:56.256 --> 03:48:56.877]  Thanks for holding.
[03:48:56.897 --> 03:48:58.837]  Oh, no problem.
[03:48:58.857 --> 03:49:00.797]  I just wanted to make a quick comment.
[03:49:00.937 --> 03:49:02.758]  I want to talk about the economic crash.
[03:49:02.778 --> 03:49:04.838]  Did you see the Economist 2019 issue?
[03:49:05.198 --> 03:49:05.298]  No.
[03:49:05.358 --> 03:49:09.599]  I'll look for it, but go ahead.
[03:49:11.491 --> 03:49:18.054]  Yeah, it shows a picture with Trump's face on there and then it shows like a graph over him, you know, like they're hitting at a economic crash.
[03:49:18.114 --> 03:49:21.516]  And then it also shows like, you know, a picture of a painted bear representing China.
[03:49:21.596 --> 03:49:24.117]  And it shows, you know, a thing about Brexit.
[03:49:24.177 --> 03:49:28.419]  It shows the thing about Putin and the Four Horsemen and all kinds of stuff.
[03:49:28.479 --> 03:49:36.703]  It even shows stuff about, you know, the transhumanism movement, where it's a stork holding, you know, a bag with a barcode over it.
[03:49:37.165 --> 03:49:40.388]  So, you know, they are really planning something this upcoming year, you know.
[03:49:40.428 --> 03:49:42.710]  It's going to get pretty crazy.
[03:49:42.750 --> 03:49:51.037]  And they even have the marijuana, a guy holding the marijuana thing, so I believe that they're going to start even injecting stuff in this marijuana that they're making legal.
[03:49:51.077 --> 03:49:54.801]  You know, it's dumbed down the culture even more than what it already is, you know.
[03:49:54.821 --> 03:50:00.466]  It's crazy times we're in, but, you know, we just got to trust in God, and, you know, I just wanted to make that quick comment.
[03:50:01.761 --> 03:50:07.044]  Yeah, legalization almost seems like Brave New World's SOMA.
[03:50:07.244 --> 03:50:15.029]  You know, just keep the population stoned and happy, feed them on virtual reality, you know, video games, etc.
[03:50:16.050 --> 03:50:21.431]  No, we're seeing kids have their brains rewired, you know, with the with the smartphones there.
[03:50:21.931 --> 03:50:33.733]  They're literally becoming stupid because they're hooked into an information machine from big from from toddler age, instead of their brain, learning to be inquisitive about the world.
[03:50:34.153 --> 03:50:35.853]  The brain is just fed messages.
[03:50:36.454 --> 03:50:44.575]  And they look at brains, children's brains now and they're, they're being ruined from a young age, making them into perfect slaves, I would, I would think.
[03:50:45.780 --> 03:50:46.221]  Let's see.
[03:50:47.585 --> 03:50:49.109]  Who do we have up here for a while?
[03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:50.733]  James in California.
[03:50:52.036 --> 03:50:52.698]  Go ahead, James.
[03:50:54.266 --> 03:50:54.706]  How's it going?
[03:50:54.726 --> 03:50:55.826]  I'm going to keep it real short.
[03:50:56.086 --> 03:50:58.607]  I'm on the front lines here of California.
[03:50:58.627 --> 03:51:01.968]  I'm a 29-year-old in Sacramento, Citrus Heights area.
[03:51:02.028 --> 03:51:03.408]  My name's Jimmy Bazalion.
[03:51:04.709 --> 03:51:06.349]  Let's take it back to 1776.
[03:51:07.349 --> 03:51:12.171]  Our fathers, our founding fathers, our men and women fought like the savage Indians.
[03:51:12.751 --> 03:51:14.351]  Like to call it guerrilla warfare.
[03:51:14.391 --> 03:51:16.312]  As the Redcoats said, lined up.
[03:51:16.772 --> 03:51:18.592]  We just did a headshot after headshot.
[03:51:19.113 --> 03:51:20.693]  And I don't, I want to keep this peaceful.
[03:51:21.573 --> 03:51:25.034]  I think it's important that we do guerrilla advertising.
[03:51:25.634 --> 03:51:32.316]  I'm sure every person listening to this right now has a fence board or some sort of piece of wood and some paint laying around the house.
[03:51:32.376 --> 03:51:43.719]  It's as simple as taking a drill and some screws, painting your rights onto a board, and getting your information out that way, because we all know we're being censored on Google, Facebook.
[03:51:44.199 --> 03:51:45.679]  That will in turn go viral.
[03:51:46.159 --> 03:51:48.400]  You know mainstream media will love to cover this.
[03:51:49.827 --> 03:51:51.648]  We're all Alex Jones.
[03:51:52.388 --> 03:51:54.528]  An injury to one of us is an injury to all of us.
[03:51:54.588 --> 03:51:57.469]  Keep your chin in, your chest down, and be proud to be an American.
[03:51:58.730 --> 03:52:03.091]  Yeah, I think guerrilla marketing of ideas can be very effective.
[03:52:03.131 --> 03:52:08.993]  Like the, um, it's okay to be white messages totally freak out the leftists.
[03:52:09.613 --> 03:52:10.693]  Simple things like that.
[03:52:12.674 --> 03:52:13.494]  Let me see.
[03:52:14.414 --> 03:52:16.575]  We've got Liberty Smith.
[03:52:17.697 --> 03:52:20.159]  In Oklahoma, Liberty Smith.
[03:52:20.379 --> 03:52:20.900]  Cool name.
[03:52:21.340 --> 03:52:22.721]  Go ahead, Smith.
[03:52:22.901 --> 03:52:23.402]  Hey, man.
[03:52:23.422 --> 03:52:25.023]  How are you today?
[03:52:26.044 --> 03:52:26.584]  Great, thanks.
[03:52:27.265 --> 03:52:31.008]  You haven't been real encouraging today, but that's OK, because I understand.
[03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:33.530]  Trust me on this one.
[03:52:34.911 --> 03:52:43.038]  Yeah, I had several several thoughts, but the biggest one for me is is I live in a rural area in rural Oklahoma.
[03:52:44.279 --> 03:52:45.159]  I work in a 50,000
[03:52:47.805 --> 03:52:55.951]  You know, people, town, and they're basically all conservatives, but about 70% of Oklahoma is.
[03:52:56.471 --> 03:53:04.617]  But one thing I noticed is nobody in this town in Ardmore, Oklahoma, has a sign up for Trump, has anything up.
[03:53:05.118 --> 03:53:08.180]  But you'll see all the liberals, they got all their crap up.
[03:53:09.041 --> 03:53:12.103]  And the thing I'm wondering about is, is
[03:53:12.992 --> 03:53:19.773]  How can I, as a 61-year-old with 11 grandchildren, do more than what I'm already doing?
[03:53:19.853 --> 03:53:22.054]  And, you know, I call the White House.
[03:53:22.174 --> 03:53:26.254]  I email the president and congressmen and everything else.
[03:53:26.314 --> 03:53:31.215]  And I do it about once a week or twice a month or whatever.
[03:53:32.255 --> 03:53:33.476]  And I want to do more.
[03:53:33.916 --> 03:53:34.756]  I am restless.
[03:53:34.776 --> 03:53:36.216]  I am sick of this crap.
[03:53:37.136 --> 03:53:41.657]  And I think, you know, the audience, the info warriors are, too.
[03:53:42.409 --> 03:53:50.531]  So my question is, rural America, older, loves our country, loves my children and grandchildren, what else can I do?
[03:53:52.872 --> 03:53:56.453]  I don't know, but when you drive around, your vehicle's going to be seen.
[03:53:56.733 --> 03:53:59.614]  I like the idea of these magnetic InfoWare stickers.
[03:54:00.014 --> 03:54:04.455]  You can also get full-sized sheets of, it's like the refrigerator magnet material.
[03:54:05.177 --> 03:54:08.619]  Then you can stick a Trump bumper sticker or any other bumper sticker on it.
[03:54:09.180 --> 03:54:13.083]  But you're not committed to it if you're afraid your car's going to get keyed in certain areas.
[03:54:13.103 --> 03:54:19.707]  But when you're just driving around in normal life, you can put any message you want on your vehicle and take it off when you want.
[03:54:20.448 --> 03:54:24.571]  I'm the same age, and it's pretty discouraging.
[03:54:24.591 --> 03:54:26.692]  It almost feels like we have no voice.
[03:54:27.473 --> 03:54:33.357]  Eventually, it might come to some kind of a yellow vest movement in America, you know, with taking to the streets.
[03:54:34.269 --> 03:54:42.394]  You know, in the USA, mostly it's urban versus rural, and eventually, if it comes to a civil war, you know, they don't grow food in the cities.
[03:54:42.495 --> 03:54:43.976]  It's just something to keep in mind.
[03:54:46.497 --> 03:54:47.438]  Maybe last call.
[03:54:47.618 --> 03:54:50.040]  Gary in Texas says, when is it time?
[03:54:50.560 --> 03:54:51.861]  Gary in Texas, go ahead.
[03:54:53.222 --> 03:54:54.162]  Yes, sir.
[03:54:54.202 --> 03:54:55.343]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:54:55.984 --> 03:54:58.205]  My question is, when do you know it's time?
[03:54:59.766 --> 03:55:00.887]  When do you know it's time?
[03:55:03.055 --> 03:55:27.183]  Well, I think that as long as we're able to have this show, for example, while we're still broadcasting, even on maybe you could say reduced volume since InfoWars has been largely banned from mainstream broadcasting on YouTube and so forth, when you see voices like Alex Jones and my own and others
[03:55:28.127 --> 03:55:32.272]  Going silent, that will be a big clue that the time is getting close.
[03:55:32.832 --> 03:55:41.381]  But really, I don't, there won't be any kind of revolution in this country as long as food supply is going, electricity is flowing.
[03:55:41.822 --> 03:55:43.984]  It's not going to happen just for political reasons.
[03:55:44.748 --> 03:55:50.193]  It won't happen until there's a real pinch, you know, an economic collapse, food distribution breaks down.
[03:55:50.774 --> 03:55:52.996]  When that happens, all hell is going to break loose.
[03:55:53.677 --> 03:55:59.222]  And unfortunately, I think that that's inevitable at some point, especially with the Democrats
[03:56:00.555 --> 03:56:02.336]  Basically, they're globalists.
[03:56:02.416 --> 03:56:13.701]  They want to change America fundamentally, as Obama put it, make it just another third-world country, because Democrats actually love ruling third-world countries.
[03:56:13.741 --> 03:56:16.782]  Look at Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia.
[03:56:17.443 --> 03:56:23.545]  Any of the cities that the Democrats have ruled for generations are a microcosm of a third-world country.
[03:56:24.165 --> 03:56:27.487]  And they don't care if the people are hungry, if crime is out of control.
[03:56:28.405 --> 03:56:29.586]  Look at Maxine Woerner.
[03:56:29.626 --> 03:56:31.466]  She lived in a $4 million mansion.
[03:56:32.167 --> 03:56:34.808]  Her district is mostly very poor people.
[03:56:35.228 --> 03:56:37.008]  She lives out of the district in the mansion.
[03:56:37.529 --> 03:56:41.310]  So the Democrats don't care if the country is ruined as long as they're ruling it.
[03:56:41.710 --> 03:56:43.551]  They don't mind ruling the ruins.
[03:56:44.191 --> 03:56:53.875]  So I don't think there's going to be anything like a real civil war until all of this eventually collapses in a heap and the country has an economy like Venezuela.
[03:56:54.515 --> 03:56:56.076]  That's when it's going to, that's when the
[03:56:57.122 --> 03:57:00.323]  That's when the S is going to hit the fan for sure.
[03:57:00.743 --> 03:57:09.367]  But as long as people have their smartphones, TVs, video games, refrigerators full, then there's not going to be anything happening.
[03:57:09.387 --> 03:57:17.870]  We're just going to be grinding our teeth and and, you know, wailing to each other here on on, you know, the Internet and social media.
[03:57:17.890 --> 03:57:25.673]  But eventually where it where it happens is when the refrigerator is empty and there are no more food trucks coming.
[03:57:26.357 --> 03:57:28.679]  That's going to be the final sign.
[03:57:29.179 --> 03:57:39.728]  Well, it's been fun taking calls this last hour of the week on InfoWars, and I'll see you next week or sometime in the future, and maybe then I'll be more cheerful.
[03:57:40.228 --> 03:57:45.272]  But Merry Christmas to the InfoWars Army, and keep fighting.
[03:57:45.572 --> 03:57:46.193]  Never give up.
[03:57:46.493 --> 03:57:47.214]  Never surrender.
[03:57:51.502 --> 03:58:02.244]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history because Soros and the Globalists are all over the news trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut down our shopping carts, trying to destroy us.
[03:58:02.844 --> 03:58:06.245]  They have kicked us off almost every media outlet out there because we're loyal Americans.
[03:58:06.285 --> 03:58:18.447]  But thanks to you supporting us, we're on more radio stations and more TV stations than ever because these stations understand that Trump and myself and many others are being persecuted by the Globalists, by the Leftists, by the Hollywood scum.
[03:58:19.332 --> 03:58:21.013]  But InfoWars is in your hands.
[03:58:21.073 --> 03:58:28.759]  So this Christmas, only a few days until Christmas left, I want to just thank all the viewers and listeners for your support, for your prayers, and for being in this together.
[03:58:28.940 --> 03:58:38.247]  And just to remind you again, please share the articles, please share the videos from NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com because those get around the censors easier than InfoWars.com.
[03:58:38.527 --> 03:58:44.051]  But whatever you do, realize this country and this planet is in a fight for its life against the globalists and
[03:58:45.152 --> 03:58:57.908]  It is financing that allows us to do what we do and that's why it is a total win for everybody because you get great products at InfoWareStore.com and at the same time you help fund this operation that is fearlessly fighting the globalists as hard as we can.
[03:58:58.428 --> 03:58:59.730]  Now we've sold out of some of our
