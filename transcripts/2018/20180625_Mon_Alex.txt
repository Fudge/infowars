[00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.250]  They think you're a goldfish!
[00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.972]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:11.033]  I believe in you!
[00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:12.854]  I don't think you're stupid!
[00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:17.517]  One man, Everett's a woman!
[00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:19.458]  Old genitals were cut off!
[00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.100]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.481]  And we're not backing down ever!
[00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:26.503]  I want to kick these people!
[00:00:26.563 --> 00:00:27.083]  We're winning!
[00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:28.244]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[00:00:28.404 --> 00:00:28.864]  Can't you?
[00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:30.806]  We have broken their back!
[00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:32.287]  Yes, I can feel it!
[00:00:36.132 --> 00:00:36.452]  Let's go!
[00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:36.612]  Come on!
[00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:36.913]  Come on!

[00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.419]  Come on!
[00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.579]  Come on!
[00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.799]  Come on!

[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.420]  Come on!
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.820]  Come on!
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.040]  Come on!

[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.161]  Come on!
[00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:51.441]  Come on!
[00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:51.761]  Come on!
[00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:52.101]  Come on!

[00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:52.782]  Come on!
[00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:53.002]  Come on!
[00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:53.262]  Come on!

[00:00:53.982 --> 00:00:54.262]  Come on!
[00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:54.623]  Come on!
[00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:54.863]  Come on!
[00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:55.583]  Come on!
[00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:55.863]  Come on!
[00:00:55.883 --> 00:00:56.043]  Come on!
[00:00:56.063 --> 00:00:56.324]  Come on!
[00:00:56.404 --> 00:00:56.684]  Come on!
[00:00:56.704 --> 00:00:56.904]  Come on!
[00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:57.084]  Come on!
[00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:57.244]  Come on!
[00:00:57.284 --> 00:00:57.444]  Come on!
[00:00:57.504 --> 00:00:57.664]  Come on!
[00:00:57.684 --> 00:00:57.924]  Come on!
[00:00:57.944 --> 00:00:58.385]  Come on!
[00:00:58.405 --> 00:00:58.545]  Come on!
[00:00:58.565 --> 00:00:58.685]  Come
[00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:12.267]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:40.706 --> 00:02:05.155]  It is incredibly sensational and important to everybody in the world, not just here in the U.S., that the Democrats are openly preparing a physical uprising revolution in the United States with enough violence and burning cities and racial conflict to be able to sell the idea to the weak-kneed
[00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:08.003]  We're good to go.
[00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:32.874]  The most weak-minded, easily-led followers.
[00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:37.837]  But above them are criminals that are 100% conscious of their operations.
[00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:58.589]  Now, it cannot be overstressed that they are trying to trigger a civil war, and that we already have a cultural civil war going on in this country by the anti-prosperity, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, and it's being programmed anti-white, even though it's white people actually trying to create the racial control.
[00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:01.518]  That's who's leading it and quarterbacking it.
[00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.939]  Most of the minorities are not buying into it, because they know they're the majority and why would they want to burn down the country that's theirs?
[00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:23.063]  So, there's a huge global awakening happening, and the establishment has got its moron rent-a-mobs out across the world, not just here, trying to bully nationalists, capitalists, populists back into submission.
[00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:26.064]  But they were never under your submission, they were asleep.
[00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:31.688]  I believe history shows, the evidence already shows, that this will cause a greater awakening to take place.
[00:03:32.488 --> 00:03:37.911]  The problem is that's two different freight trains at high speed moving towards each other on the same track.
[00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:44.815]  And you've got a lot of top historians coming out and saying that current political environment is pre-Civil War.
[00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:55.761]  Well, there's that point in flux, flashpoint, where when were you pre, when were you in it, and by the time you're in the Civil War, it's too late.
[00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:14.316]  I'm going to try to brief the President here on air today, and I'm going to try to brief the listeners and viewers and everybody else, but the President already knows this, but he needs his own people to understand it, and I have been tasked with taking this message to the people.
[00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:24.765]  So, I can't get into it, and I'm not going to give the specifics of it, but these are the hard messages that have to be said that other people are scared to come out and tell you.
[00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:27.176]  The president calls CNN your enemy.
[00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:29.498]  He calls the Democrats enemies of America.
[00:04:29.838 --> 00:04:31.839]  They are on the Communist Chinese payroll.
[00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.600]  And they're on the big bank payroll.
[00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.662]  And those groups are actively trying to destroy the country.
[00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:37.943]  That's what's happening.
[00:04:37.983 --> 00:04:39.324]  So when you're against Trump,
[00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:41.323]  You're against info wars.
[00:04:41.723 --> 00:04:42.684]  You're against free speech.
[00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:43.705]  You're against all of this.
[00:04:43.745 --> 00:04:45.867]  You are trying to destroy the country.
[00:04:45.907 --> 00:04:47.769]  And the left's like, of course, we hate America.
[00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.250]  Tell us something we didn't know.
[00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:58.959]  That's why they've been prepared for 50 years in the universities to now come out and call and celebrate against prosperity, against the economy, against freedom, against security.
[00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.260]  They said they want it all gone.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.281]  Bill Maher, everybody says that.
[00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.897]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:05.337]  Go ahead.
[00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:07.819]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.861]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:05:11.702 --> 00:05:12.803]  It just gets old, man.
[00:05:13.123 --> 00:05:14.865]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:17.627]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:21.870]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.372]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:05:25.193 --> 00:05:27.515]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.996]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:30.117]  Us being shut down?
[00:05:30.357 --> 00:05:31.378]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:32.838]  You know what, Alex?
[00:05:32.898 --> 00:05:33.959]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:34.819]  Hey, Frank!
[00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:40.441]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:45.023]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:05:45.263 --> 00:05:48.144]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:05:48.404 --> 00:05:48.784]  You understand?
[00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:50.144]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:05:50.504 --> 00:05:51.665]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:57.547]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:05:58.527 --> 00:05:59.207]  Do you understand?
[00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:00.408]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.412]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:14.295]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:31.125]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.031 --> 00:06:57.876]  Well, on Saturday, The Hill reported that the former director of the CIA, John Brennan, has asked Trump's cabinet... You guys will reprint me that article, it'd be great.
[00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:05.939]  ...has asked Trump's cabinet to overthrow him.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.921]  You guys need to close your microphone.
[00:07:18.134 --> 00:07:35.217]  You know, this stuff is so heavy and so big and so real and the public has no idea that the entire civilization we've built is under attack and that the globalists admit they want to finally break the West back completely.
[00:07:42.618 --> 00:07:46.939]  And we're already being pushed in the first stages of a civil war.
[00:07:50.422 --> 00:07:54.843]  And it's so big and important, I think I'm going to go to rebroadcast until I'm ready to present this on air today.
[00:07:54.863 --> 00:08:05.207]  Because I came in and got sidetracked with some other stuff and I need to get all my material together to go through it linearly because it needs to be laid out properly and given the respect that it deserves and that it needs.
[00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:06.987]  And I'm just not ready to do it at this point.
[00:08:08.848 --> 00:08:10.088]  I may just do rebroadcast the whole day.
[00:08:10.128 --> 00:08:10.608]  I may just leave.
[00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:15.670]  Only because things this bad, things this serious, you just can't kind of half-ass.
[00:08:17.776 --> 00:08:29.321]  Because we all just get caught up in the minutiae of life and where we are and don't realize how close we are to a shooting war in this country.
[00:08:30.722 --> 00:08:43.207]  And you know, I hope that all the weird leftists and people that have bought this anti-America, anti-free market Kool-Aid, I hope that
[00:08:48.368 --> 00:09:00.438]  They understand that they're useful idiots and are destroying the very fabric of a system and a world that they live in.
[00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:05.623]  I mean, what they're bringing in is a dystopia for the general public.
[00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:10.467]  And is designed to be, and is designed to be austere.
[00:09:11.447 --> 00:09:14.730]  And is designed to be very, very nightmarish.
[00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:16.732]  And it's a whole other system.
[00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:45.799]  We're dealing with people driven by evil, driven by lust for power, driven by fraud, who purposefully want to bully this country and this world into total submission.
[00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:49.001]  That's what's going on.
[00:09:49.262 --> 00:09:49.842]  That's what's happening.
[00:09:54.349 --> 00:09:56.571]  They want victory over prosperity.
[00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:58.213]  They want victory over common sense.
[00:09:58.553 --> 00:10:00.155]  They want victory over sanity.
[00:10:00.515 --> 00:10:01.816]  They want victory over the truth.
[00:10:01.856 --> 00:10:03.017]  They want victory over life.
[00:10:03.317 --> 00:10:09.143]  They want to control everything because normal systems don't need them or don't want them.
[00:10:09.744 --> 00:10:19.493]  And so they have to create designed dysfunction and human obsolescence because they see themselves as obsolescent.
[00:10:20.424 --> 00:10:29.568]  And so only by clawing us down to the groveling, unhappy level that they're in, do they believe that they could ever find any type of security.
[00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:32.870]  So we're in a civil war.
[00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.250]  It's global.
[00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.971]  I want to lay out the big players.
[00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:45.615]  I want to lay out the goals of the globals at the top, and then look at how they're attacking the nation state from what's happening in Europe, what's happening here, and other areas.
[00:10:45.956 --> 00:10:46.896]  So that's coming up.
[00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:05.070]  There are a few special reports here now.
[00:11:11.855 --> 00:11:22.301]  We're also going to look at some of the geopolitical things that are happening, but this is all tied in to the future and humans making a decision about our destiny.
[00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:28.866]  And folks need to know that when I lay out the players,
[00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:36.359]  They admit they're the players, they admit the global cosmology I'm laying out is the real world.
[00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:42.381]  They've got everybody playing these other political games off in La La Land, while the real stuff's going on right in front of everybody.
[00:11:44.502 --> 00:11:53.405]  And what the globalists are pushing is so unpopular and authoritarian and classically evil, if we just enforce a real debate about it, it will fail.
[00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:54.746]  And it is failing now.
[00:11:55.811 --> 00:12:05.959]  But they're going to culture war and division and infighting and weaponized media as a counter to that and are pushing the world into war and depression.
[00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:12.705]  And Trump is running around like a fire department in the middle of a hot summer with 50 mile an hour winds trying to put all these fires out.
[00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:16.608]  We've got the Democrats and others who are just a bunch of yes men
[00:12:17.901 --> 00:12:20.703]  On their power trips, doing everything they can to sabotage that.
[00:12:21.364 --> 00:12:23.665]  Even though it will destroy them even faster.
[00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:26.287]  Because they want to continue their control.
[00:12:26.568 --> 00:12:28.109]  They want to continue their mismanagement.
[00:12:28.409 --> 00:12:30.611]  Let's go out to break with some of the John Bowne report.
[00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:33.073]  Dealing with the Red Hen.
[00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:36.753]  Stinks of fascism.
[00:12:37.654 --> 00:12:39.155]  But it stinks of just bullying.
[00:12:40.216 --> 00:12:44.821]  And I wish all these places would put on their door, we don't want Christians here.
[00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:46.783]  We don't want conservatives here.
[00:12:47.123 --> 00:12:48.404]  We don't want capitalists here.
[00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:50.086]  We don't want libertarians here.
[00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:51.787]  We don't want white people here.
[00:12:52.788 --> 00:12:53.349]  I'm serious.
[00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.531]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.323]  And tell me, I don't want to come in your place.
[00:13:00.423 --> 00:13:01.424]  I don't want to be around you.
[00:13:01.984 --> 00:13:05.887]  By the way, you're all escaping your blue states, your blue cities, to come vampire off me.
[00:13:05.907 --> 00:13:08.889]  And everybody else.
[00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:11.111]  It's so sick how we can't get away from you people.
[00:13:11.752 --> 00:13:14.174]  It's like the lady speaking in the EU Parliament last week.
[00:13:16.035 --> 00:13:19.298]  And she says,
[00:13:21.713 --> 00:13:22.894]  I want out of the Euro.
[00:13:22.934 --> 00:13:24.114]  We never voted to be in it.
[00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:26.075]  And they cut her mic off and say, go back!
[00:13:26.115 --> 00:13:27.856]  We don't want to hear from you speaking for England.
[00:13:28.916 --> 00:13:31.277]  And she's like, screaming with her mic cut off.
[00:13:31.297 --> 00:13:31.937]  You can still hear her.
[00:13:34.078 --> 00:13:35.179]  But that's what we're saying!
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.300]  No, you don't get to speak.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.041]  Go away.
[00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:42.262]  And we're going to keep ruling your life.
[00:13:44.162 --> 00:13:44.763]  It's the same thing.
[00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:57.080]  Everybody that went to California from all over the world thinking they were gonna, you know, find heaven, they're like moths to a flame, narcissists and wannabe famous people to Los Angeles.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.121]  That all has imploded to living hell.
[00:14:01.462 --> 00:14:04.223]  Everyone looks like dead zombies, the air is poisoned.
[00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:05.804]  It's like, Mike, this is hell on earth.
[00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:18.696]  And now they're evacuating, but then they want to come wherever you're at and put you basically in a political cage like a milk cow that has to feed them.
[00:14:20.953 --> 00:14:27.035]  And so now they're all about peer pressure and they're all about being followers, so they think harassing us is going to make us bow down to them.
[00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:31.036]  No, everyone's now already had the idea, already thought of this a few days ago, now you're seeing it.
[00:14:31.536 --> 00:14:35.598]  Everyone's already going on Yelp and everywhere else and saying this is not conservative friendly.
[00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:37.438]  This is not libertarian friendly.
[00:14:37.678 --> 00:14:42.580]  And you can go on with a Trump shirt or an Infowars shirt and go into these restaurants and have them throw you out.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:52.867]  And then come back with your friends a week later and then all just go tell people this isn't friendly to conservatives or libertarians or nationalists and let them go bankrupt.
[00:14:52.907 --> 00:15:01.993]  They're telling us when they put us under economic embargo, when they try to censor us offline, when they try to kick us out of the restaurants, when they try to make us uncomfortable.
[00:15:02.354 --> 00:15:05.536]  Like three, four years ago, leftists would walk over and knock my drink over in a restaurant.
[00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:10.339]  Or go, boo, boo, boo, Alex Jones, you're unpopular, like it hurts me.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.381]  You've seen it on live videos countless times.
[00:15:13.262 --> 00:15:14.223]  Shame, shame, shame.
[00:15:14.243 --> 00:15:15.764]  I'm like, dude, I ain't three years old.
[00:15:17.325 --> 00:15:18.646]  I moved out when I was 17.
[00:15:20.328 --> 00:15:23.931]  Ain't been, you know, breastfeeding off mama in, you know, 40-something years.
[00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:26.072]  Saying shame, shame, shame.
[00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:27.514]  I'm not a kindergartner.
[00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:29.315]  Not one of your kindergartner students.
[00:15:31.757 --> 00:15:32.718]  But that's what they do.
[00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.540]  So I want them to tell me
[00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:36.931]  Who they are.
[00:15:37.132 --> 00:15:39.714]  Like, I look at hotels now, and if they're globalist, I don't stay there.
[00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:46.981]  And so as the people that actually work and make the money in the world, as the capitalist, I get it.
[00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:53.947]  Hey, leftists, believe me, I don't want to be around you, I don't want to eat your stinking food, drink your coffee, I don't want to talk to you.
[00:15:54.207 --> 00:16:00.613]  I want you to go crawl back into one of your blue city areas and just basically live on the street and crap everywhere like you do normally.
[00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:07.898]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[00:17:12.151 --> 00:17:19.538]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.

[00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.094]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:18:05.595 --> 00:18:08.358]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:14.706]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:17.929]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.113]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:18:22.473 --> 00:18:28.558]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:33.922]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:18:34.659 --> 00:18:38.061]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:18:38.582 --> 00:18:45.126]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:18:45.786 --> 00:18:50.469]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:56.113]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:18:56.713 --> 00:19:00.676]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:12.762]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[00:20:05.478 --> 00:20:08.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.761 --> 00:20:24.664]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:27.827]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.389 --> 00:20:44.922]  Trump Administration Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she politely left the establishment known as the Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington, Virginia after being told by the manager that she would not be served in their establishment.
[00:20:45.422 --> 00:20:56.873]  Mediaite reports Red Hen owner Stephanie Wilkinson told the Washington Post that she was actually home when she got a phone call informing her that Sanders had walked into her small farm to table restaurant.
[00:20:57.453 --> 00:21:01.357]  Wilkinson told Washington Post, I said I'd be down to see if it's true.
[00:21:01.837 --> 00:21:06.482]  She then huddled with the staff, many who took issue with the White House on a number of issues.
[00:21:07.242 --> 00:21:12.244]  She said, I was babbling a little, but I got my point across in a polite and direct fashion.
[00:21:12.524 --> 00:21:20.128]  I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty and compassion and cooperation.
[00:21:20.528 --> 00:21:22.089]  I said I'd like to ask you to leave.
[00:21:22.729 --> 00:21:28.494]  Sanders, who Wilkinson did confirm left without a huff, told her side of the story on Twitter later.
[00:21:28.874 --> 00:21:35.840]  A move that, according to former ethics head Walter Schaub, may have actually violated ethics rules.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.743]  Yelp is still getting reviews concerning the hypocrisy.
[00:21:40.284 --> 00:21:46.048]  DB writes, I remember the days when certain people in the South were not allowed to eat in restaurants.
[00:21:46.409 --> 00:21:50.012]  Looks like nothing has changed with the Southern Democrat crowd.
[00:21:50.692 --> 00:21:56.794]  Another Yelp review reads, Wow, kicking customers out of your restaurant because of their employer.
[00:21:57.194 --> 00:22:00.394]  If she were black or gay, the liberals would be going crazy.
[00:22:00.795 --> 00:22:05.096]  Another review read, I thought the Liberal Democrat Party was about peace, love, and tolerance.
[00:22:05.196 --> 00:22:07.416]  Not much of that going on at this restaurant.
[00:22:07.876 --> 00:22:10.677]  This is an example of what is wrong with America right now.
[00:22:11.037 --> 00:22:14.158]  When they were in power, they acted like they were so kind and tolerant.
[00:22:14.478 --> 00:22:16.418]  But they lose power and the claws come out.
[00:22:16.818 --> 00:22:18.439]  And their true colors shine through.
[00:22:19.219 --> 00:22:28.408]  And another Yelp review reads, this lame restaurant only got two and a half out of five stars and rejects customers based on their customers politics, laughing out loud.
[00:22:28.888 --> 00:22:35.815]  The Gateway Pundit reported that a hacker even changed the menu description to be that of a description of erectile dysfunction.
[00:22:36.335 --> 00:22:39.517]  Are Republicans going to have to seek discrimination protection?
[00:22:40.038 --> 00:22:45.081]  After all, the Democrats are threatening them and their children on a regular basis with murder and rape.
[00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:49.744]  Hey, but the Democrats are at the forefront of tolerance and inclusion, you say?
[00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:53.587]  Here's a little history lesson about the hidden fascism of the Democrats.
[00:22:54.047 --> 00:23:03.053]  It was Democrat Party founder President Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren that ignored the Supreme Court and relocated the Cherokee on the Trail of Tears.
[00:23:03.473 --> 00:23:05.695]  It was Democrat President James K. Polk
[00:23:06.075 --> 00:23:09.958]  That pushed for the Mexican War resulting in the massacre of Mexican civilians.
[00:23:10.338 --> 00:23:14.882]  And it was the old Southern Democrats that primarily defended slavery and Jim Crow.
[00:23:15.282 --> 00:23:24.129]  And it was Democrat President FDR who interned the Japanese during World War II and refused to support federal anti-lynching legislation.
[00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:28.152]  Not to mention the Democrats' long history with the KKK.
[00:23:28.572 --> 00:23:34.216]  Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware of the left-right paradigm country club system we are all suffering under.
[00:23:35.137 --> 00:23:40.620]  And maybe it sounds like the twist to a bad horror film, Democrats, but yes, it is you.
[00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:53.168]  You are the despicable creature massacring this republic, no longer searching for the truth behind your rhetoric, instead collectivizing a mob rule mentality that is foreign to our shared Bill of Rights.
[00:23:53.568 --> 00:23:59.672]  In fact, I'm just going to politely ask the Democrats to just sit this upcoming 4th of July out.
[00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:03.254]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:24:03.535 --> 00:24:04.075]  That's powerful.
[00:24:05.978 --> 00:24:06.059]  Yeah.
[00:24:19.755 --> 00:24:29.240]  Federal Bureau of Investigation Embarrassment James Comey took his treason tour to Ireland in full anti-Trump bias, claiming he was so ashamed of current U.S.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:35.302]  immigration policies that he considered telling Irish customs officials that he was Canadian when he arrived.
[00:24:35.663 --> 00:24:38.704]  Harmless rhetoric or another slap in America's face.
[00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:43.666]  He was blaming policies from a previous administration that he was a part of.
[00:24:44.127 --> 00:24:48.409]  The thought that he is now responsible for keeping America safe
[00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:57.176]  And yet, when you use a word like infested with immigrants, that's not a good sign.
[00:24:57.676 --> 00:24:58.897]  No, it's not who we are.
[00:24:59.578 --> 00:25:02.941]  And the good news is, we know that about ourselves.
[00:25:03.041 --> 00:25:04.943]  I think our British colleagues know it about us.
[00:25:04.983 --> 00:25:05.964]  We're better than that.
[00:25:07.065 --> 00:25:12.269]  And no president in a four-year term or an eight-year term can essentially change America.
[00:25:12.329 --> 00:25:13.270]  Listen to the condescension.
[00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.132]  It's not painful and concerning in the short term.
[00:25:15.777 --> 00:25:42.607]  Earlier this week, a clearly biased and treasonous FBI agent, Peter Strzok, was removed from his office and placed under investigation by the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, as the Justice Department revealed in Inspector General Horowitz's IG report that Strzok and four other FBI employees sent hostile anti-Trump messages using taxpayer-funded bureau devices, a violation of FBI rules.
[00:25:43.387 --> 00:25:49.168]  But when the FBI agent says he's going to stop it, that sounds like collusion at the highest level and an attempt to improperly interfere
[00:26:12.874 --> 00:26:18.216]  With a legitimate election, Congress is entitled to know everything about that in real time.
[00:26:18.636 --> 00:26:20.276]  But don't count your chickens just yet.
[00:26:20.656 --> 00:26:29.639]  Inspector General Horowitz confirmed that he is investigating if Strzok's anti-Trump bias played a role in the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation.
[00:26:30.019 --> 00:26:37.141]  And further evidence regarding gifts the FBI agents received from reporters has yet to be completely revealed.
[00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:41.803]  As detailed in our report, we found that the inappropriate political messages we uncovered
[00:26:42.483 --> 00:26:52.691]  Cast a cloud over the Midyear investigation, sowed doubt about the credibility of the FBI's handling of it, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.
[00:26:54.152 --> 00:27:09.544]  We found the implication that senior FBI employees would be willing to take official action to impact a presidential candidate's electoral prospects to be deeply troubling and antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the Justice Department.
[00:27:10.703 --> 00:27:21.656]  And also, The Hill reports Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley wants to subpoena former FBI Director James Comey and Loretta Lynch, who served as Attorney General in the Obama administration.
[00:27:22.876 --> 00:27:30.261]  This is the second time since he was fired that Mr. Comey refused an invitation to testify here voluntarily.
[00:27:31.261 --> 00:27:42.688]  He has time for book tours and television interviews, but apparently no time to assist this committee, which has primary jurisdiction over the Justice Department.
[00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:43.669]  Ms.
[00:27:43.749 --> 00:27:45.670]  Lynch also chose not to show up.
[00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:52.214]  The need for transparency does not end when senior officials are fired or quit.
[00:27:53.166 --> 00:28:10.419]  If the IG report were to be taken seriously by the Country Club of Backscratchers in the District of Criminals, not only would Hillary be finally brought front and center to answer to her lackey James Comey's watered-down bungling of her treasonous crimes against national security, but Obama himself
[00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:23.903]  Or another senior official, as Comey disguised him, would be entangled in Hillary's still unresolved email scandal as Obama absolutely improperly communicated on an illicit email server.
[00:28:24.223 --> 00:28:28.144]  Again, all of this due to Hillary's unresolved email scandal.
[00:28:28.544 --> 00:28:35.946]  A long-suffering scandal so blatantly criminal that the very investigation into it is under investigation.
[00:28:36.466 --> 00:28:39.507]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:28:51.397 --> 00:29:04.003]  If you are consuming this transmission, you are a resistance soldier.
[00:29:04.023 --> 00:29:04.983]  You better go inside.
[00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:07.064]  Get my free coffee.
[00:29:08.045 --> 00:29:08.605]  Y'all ready?
[00:29:09.295 --> 00:29:09.835]  How you doing?
[00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:10.576]  Good, how are you?
[00:29:10.776 --> 00:29:14.978]  Alright, I heard y'all was racist, so I came to get my own free coffee.
[00:29:15.498 --> 00:29:15.998]  I saw that.
[00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:21.821]  Yeah, I heard you guys don't like black people, so I wanted to get my Starbucks reparations voucher.
[00:29:23.422 --> 00:29:23.782]  What's that?
[00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:24.583]  Is that a real thing?
[00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:25.663]  It's a real thing.
[00:29:25.683 --> 00:29:27.104]  I mean, I'll give it to you.
[00:29:27.204 --> 00:29:28.825]  I saw that on my Twitter last night.
[00:29:28.865 --> 00:29:29.485]  I was like...
[00:29:30.035 --> 00:29:31.436]  Yeah, I need a free coffee.
[00:29:31.516 --> 00:29:34.557]  I'll give you a free coffee.
[00:29:34.577 --> 00:29:34.777]  Yeah.
[00:29:34.817 --> 00:29:36.097]  Reparations, man.
[00:29:36.117 --> 00:29:38.558]  Gotta get my reparations for being black in America.
[00:29:38.898 --> 00:29:39.819]  Black Lives Matter.
[00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:42.540]  Do we need flavors in it?
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.220]  We got caramel, hazelnut.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.281]  I'll take caramel.
[00:29:47.768 --> 00:29:48.268]  What's your name?
[00:29:48.368 --> 00:29:49.069]  I appreciate you.
[00:29:49.369 --> 00:29:49.829]  Amanda?
[00:29:50.069 --> 00:29:51.250]  Amanda, you are great.
[00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:51.810]  Is it?
[00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.291]  You're amazing.
[00:29:53.311 --> 00:29:54.352]  Thank you.
[00:29:54.372 --> 00:29:56.193]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:56.213 --> 00:29:58.034]  You gotta get your free coffee out here, man.
[00:29:58.074 --> 00:30:00.835]  You gotta get your Starbucks reparations, man.
[00:30:01.516 --> 00:30:02.676]  Hotep Jesus was the man.
[00:30:02.896 --> 00:30:05.998]  So he got the brilliant idea to go into a Starbucks and demand a coffee.
[00:30:06.018 --> 00:30:06.939]  Otherwise, they're racist.
[00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:09.320]  He's gonna go get a free chocolate chip cookie after the show.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.701]  So there's... He got his Starbucks mug right there.
[00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:12.922]  Was that a free Joe?
[00:30:16.673 --> 00:30:19.637]  It was the free joke.
[00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:26.706]  So we need to get that cup and put that cup in a glass case and save it for all eternity.
[00:30:26.746 --> 00:30:27.548]  There it is right there.
[00:30:27.828 --> 00:30:29.150]  Oh, they even put your name on there!
[00:30:30.031 --> 00:30:30.992]  That's a great picture!
[00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.972]  You know, I understand liberal politics.
[00:30:38.713 --> 00:30:42.496]  I've been studying it for a while now and understand that.
[00:30:42.816 --> 00:30:43.877]  And I tweeted this before.
[00:30:43.897 --> 00:30:57.066]  I said, if an individual, especially a black individual, wants to excel in this society, they should follow the liberal narrative and all doors and opportunities will be open to them.
[00:30:58.147 --> 00:30:59.387]  And I knew it would work.
[00:30:59.407 --> 00:30:59.928]  I knew it would work.
[00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:02.442]  So I decided, you know, I said, you know what?
[00:31:02.722 --> 00:31:03.922]  I'm standing here by this Starbucks.
[00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.283]  I had this idea in my mind.
[00:31:05.643 --> 00:31:07.684]  I said, let's test this thing out and see what happens.
[00:31:08.064 --> 00:31:10.164]  The video started to go viral on Periscope.
[00:31:10.585 --> 00:31:11.305]  And now here we are.
[00:31:12.085 --> 00:31:18.247]  I wasn't mad at Starbucks at first, but now I'm mad at Starbucks for this racial bias training.
[00:31:18.988 --> 00:31:19.968]  And I'm going to tell you why.
[00:31:20.797 --> 00:31:24.040]  First of all, what does Eric Holder know about Black people?
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.783]  What does the NAACP or the ADL know about Black people?
[00:31:29.023 --> 00:31:31.105]  The Black people really suck one in the hood.
[00:31:31.345 --> 00:31:37.710]  You see, Black Lives Matter, NAACP, and Eric Holder are not the voice of Black people.
[00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:42.533]  That is the bourgeoisie that keep Black people down.
[00:31:42.874 --> 00:31:44.595]  And Starbucks failed.
[00:31:44.955 --> 00:31:45.556]  They failed.
[00:31:45.856 --> 00:31:56.748]  If they really wanted to do some racial so-called bias training, they would have got some real people in the real world and not these bootlickers and Uncle Tom's.
[00:31:57.009 --> 00:31:58.030]  That's what they would have done.
[00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.872]  But they don't care about black people.
[00:32:01.658 --> 00:32:09.643]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.
[00:32:09.924 --> 00:32:12.245]  And listen, everybody's got a heart.
[00:32:12.845 --> 00:32:18.229]  Well, actually maybe Hillary and George Soros don't, but everybody else has a heart, and this product is amazing.
[00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:19.390]  So, if you have a heart,

[00:32:58.756 --> 00:33:00.917]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:07.561]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.251 --> 00:33:26.517]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:33:26.958 --> 00:33:32.483]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[00:33:32.523 --> 00:33:34.225]  Kirky is now in place.
[00:33:34.265 --> 00:33:35.106]  Return to your homes.
[00:33:42.498 --> 00:33:46.462]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:47.343 --> 00:33:51.967]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:52.247 --> 00:33:54.249]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:54.329 --> 00:33:55.630]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:57.052 --> 00:34:00.855]  And we're here covering the reality of what's going on, the reality of what's happening.
[00:34:02.877 --> 00:34:07.081]  The United States is facing a multinational, multi-nation coalition
[00:34:08.228 --> 00:34:20.536]  of authoritarians attempting to bully and dominate this country into submission and shut our republic down and convert it into a serf-based high-tech technocracy.
[00:34:21.977 --> 00:34:24.399]  High-tech serfdom, in their own words.
[00:34:28.999 --> 00:34:52.438]  And the history of what's happening, and the dire consequences of what's happening, and the manifest evil of what's happening, and the fact that so many people in the general public are willing to buy lies from known frauds, and to go out and to work against their own interests, saddens me.
[00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:55.281]  Liberty is rising worldwide.
[00:34:56.442 --> 00:34:57.743]  And we're winning on many fronts.
[00:34:59.292 --> 00:35:25.385]  But the clear-cut nature of what Trump's doing, being reasonable, pragmatic, common sense, and good, on every front, versus the Democrats taking it up another notch to 11, in spinal-tap nomenclature, or parlance, it's just...
[00:35:27.671 --> 00:35:29.932]  They don't want us in their restaurants?
[00:35:30.152 --> 00:35:31.572]  They don't want to be around us?
[00:35:31.732 --> 00:35:35.154]  Believe me, I don't want to be around you.
[00:35:37.634 --> 00:35:49.999]  You know, growing up, there was always that girl that was trying to get guys to start fights with you, or claiming you'd said something to her, done something, or claiming you wanted to date her, and you didn't want to date her, but later you learned that she was mad because you never asked her out.
[00:35:50.639 --> 00:35:54.560]  That's bad enough, but this is like neurotic little followers.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.241]  I mean, leftists all look like
[00:35:57.449 --> 00:35:58.569]  There's something wrong with them.
[00:35:58.589 --> 00:36:00.730]  I don't care if they're black, white, Asian, Hispanic.
[00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:08.413]  A real leftist is a gibbering mental patient at the low level.
[00:36:08.473 --> 00:36:16.976]  At the higher levels, they're criminals, who are known criminals, who are con artists, who are there to feed on the earth, and who hate everyone.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.901]  So I don't even hate them.
[00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:23.782]  I want them out of my life.
[00:36:24.242 --> 00:36:31.687]  Please put a sign up that you don't want capitalists, Christians, conservatives, libertarians, nationalists.
[00:36:32.067 --> 00:36:33.268]  Please tell me.
[00:36:34.248 --> 00:36:35.289]  But you know, we've got to go further.
[00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:36.609]  We can look up who owns companies.
[00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:42.493]  We can look up, especially with big corporations, and just do not support them.
[00:36:42.933 --> 00:36:49.117]  The conservatives, the libertarians, the Christians, all over the world, no matter what color you are, have all the wealth.
[00:36:50.489 --> 00:36:51.390]  You can go anywhere in the world.
[00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.851]  You can go to Africa and there's squalor and death everywhere.
[00:36:53.891 --> 00:37:01.315]  And there'll be some little minority Christian tribe that's got industry and farms and has built up the entire area around them.
[00:37:01.615 --> 00:37:09.560]  But then always the Islamicist or the animist at the UN behest, like Rwanda, come in and just murder everyone.
[00:37:10.701 --> 00:37:14.343]  Take what the Christians had and then everything collapses.
[00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:22.335]  Same thing's happened in multiple places in Latin America with the Amish, who moved in there over 150 years ago when they got kicked out of Europe.
[00:37:23.515 --> 00:37:30.940]  And they'll produce in some places, in South America, some countries, 80% of the food, even though they're like 2% of the population.
[00:37:32.141 --> 00:37:32.702]  And what happens?
[00:37:32.742 --> 00:37:33.822]  The socialists get control.
[00:37:35.043 --> 00:37:36.644]  They start taking everything the Amish have.
[00:37:36.724 --> 00:37:38.205]  The Amish just stop producing.
[00:37:38.225 --> 00:37:40.407]  And everybody starts starving to death.
[00:37:41.688 --> 00:37:42.828]  The socialists get thrown out.
[00:37:43.669 --> 00:37:44.950]  The Amish are given their land back.
[00:37:46.032 --> 00:37:47.392]  And then everything starts back over again.
[00:37:47.612 --> 00:37:48.692]  Because they're Christians.
[00:37:50.933 --> 00:37:52.073]  And because they produce.
[00:37:53.813 --> 00:38:03.695]  But everybody else just goes, I'll rob them today, butcher all the cows today, we'll live high off the hog for a month, and then move on to something else like locusts.
[00:38:04.535 --> 00:38:08.576]  Like a bunch of giant grasshoppers coming across the land, eating everything down to the bone.
[00:38:10.656 --> 00:38:11.456]  And that's what's happening.
[00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:14.137]  Hispanic Christians.
[00:38:15.697 --> 00:38:26.440]  Black Christians, Arab, Middle Eastern Christians, doesn't matter, Asian Christians, it doesn't matter where you are, they produce, generally, 10 to 1.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.720]  There's big studies on this.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.541]  10 to 1 against any other group.
[00:38:31.581 --> 00:38:32.221]  Now why is that?
[00:38:32.241 --> 00:38:34.882]  Because they're following the Golden Rule.
[00:38:35.162 --> 00:38:36.602]  Doesn't mean they're perfect, but they're trying.
[00:38:39.303 --> 00:38:45.224]  And they're building things, and they're expanding, and they... It's prosperity.
[00:38:46.596 --> 00:38:50.198]  Do you think the big mega corporations like having that type of stuff around?
[00:38:50.318 --> 00:38:55.120]  By the way, I didn't even get to this yesterday, and I knew this a few months ago, and I barely covered it.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:01.863]  In Stockholm, Sweden, of course, they're going to go from giving you basically free rides on the trains.
[00:39:01.883 --> 00:39:07.665]  If you take a microchip in your hand, they got pretty girls advertising it to, oh, you're going to have to have it.
[00:39:11.158 --> 00:39:18.920]  And then you got Time Magazine and CNN and ABC News saying you will all soon get a chip in your brain, not just in your hand.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.760]  It's all here.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.760]  It's all happening.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.781]  And then I see all these giant lies that get put out.
[00:39:29.402 --> 00:39:40.804]  And you see people like Maxine Waters calling for aggressive bullying actions against people
[00:39:44.082 --> 00:39:46.142]  They are ratcheting this up.
[00:39:47.683 --> 00:39:53.964]  And what's amazing is when you look at little spoiled brats like Maxine Waters, she's like a three-year-old spoiled brat that never got in trouble.
[00:39:59.966 --> 00:40:05.807]  And then she says, you know, we're gonna play these clips coming up, she says, and you know they're getting kicked out of restaurants and let's do more of that.
[00:40:10.029 --> 00:40:12.750]  Just like they kick people out of restaurants in Nazi Germany.
[00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:27.657]  Just like they use bullying and just like they use censorship and control and gulags and ghettos where certain groups couldn't engage in commerce or business and had to be herded into these electronic ghettos of modern times.
[00:40:28.078 --> 00:40:29.458]  You are the authoritarians.
[00:40:29.518 --> 00:40:30.539]  You are really bad.
[00:40:32.418 --> 00:40:55.654]  You are the worst of the worst, and you are committed to it, and you've got a group of spoiled, rotten, loser followers with three or four degrees that can't get them a job, and they're all desperate and scared as leftist followers, not knowing why life isn't turning out good, because they followed the program, and they're being told, you go out and you take over the country, and you bully everybody, you get rid of free speech,
[00:40:56.534 --> 00:41:01.035]  And we basically, you know, enslave conservatives and make them work for us, and you'll have your future.
[00:41:01.856 --> 00:41:15.960]  And they are fully then buying on to the next level of authoritarianism, that if they become aggressive, and that if they go out and dominate their fellow humans, that then, then the big megacorporations are going to deliver them all the goodies.
[00:41:22.142 --> 00:41:23.142]  Whenever you think about it,
[00:41:26.542 --> 00:41:33.106]  All these big mega-corporations, their leaders are all leftists, and almost none of them pay taxes.
[00:41:36.187 --> 00:41:41.430]  And Bill Maher was bitchin' last Friday, in between attacking me and hoping that Mike Cernovich dies.
[00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:43.912]  He's such a nice person.
[00:41:47.134 --> 00:41:51.696]  He said, how dare you billionaires, you're all leftists, but none of you give any money.
[00:41:51.716 --> 00:41:52.857]  I've looked at the federal numbers.
[00:41:55.589 --> 00:42:00.152]  Well, that's because they give their money through those platforms being pro-Democrat, pro-globalist.
[00:42:03.635 --> 00:42:04.315]  That's why.
[00:42:05.576 --> 00:42:07.558]  They give billions in propaganda every year.
[00:42:08.398 --> 00:42:12.702]  And they're not supposed to look political on the surface.
[00:42:13.022 --> 00:42:15.964]  That's why they directly don't give the Democrats, you buffoon.
[00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:21.128]  He brags about how he gave a million dollars of his hundred million.
[00:42:23.168 --> 00:42:24.949]  You know, just to Barack Obama.
[00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.072]  Well, why didn't Bezos give a million dollars?
[00:42:28.292 --> 00:42:32.675]  Bezos is engaged in a lot bigger lobbying than that.
[00:42:34.196 --> 00:42:39.681]  So, again, that's how desperate they've gotten, where he's not even funny anymore.
[00:42:41.202 --> 00:42:45.765]  He just goes, I hate Alex Jones, he's a bad person, and I hope Mike Cernovich commits suicide.
[00:42:46.686 --> 00:42:48.367]  And you're like, how is this even funny?
[00:42:49.108 --> 00:42:51.730]  What they're saying is, kill these people!
[00:42:52.637 --> 00:42:56.339]  The message is kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.902]  That's what they're trying to get other people to do, thinking it's going to intimidate us.
[00:43:09.355 --> 00:43:10.516]  Dr. Shiva's our guest.
[00:43:10.916 --> 00:43:12.156]  Great guy running for Senate.
[00:43:12.476 --> 00:43:13.357]  Got a shot at winning.
[00:43:13.397 --> 00:43:15.898]  And Elizabeth Warren, really a smart engineer.
[00:43:16.138 --> 00:43:17.198]  Very successful businessman.
[00:43:17.519 --> 00:43:18.279]  Inventor of email.
[00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:18.679]  Look it up.
[00:43:18.759 --> 00:43:19.219]  It's true.
[00:43:19.399 --> 00:43:28.644]  And he is running against Elizabeth Warren, who will not do the genetic test, who the tribes say she has no connection to in Oklahoma or other areas.
[00:43:28.704 --> 00:43:31.685]  But he's a real Indian from the subcontinent, India.
[00:43:31.725 --> 00:43:32.585]  But he's a great patriot.
[00:43:32.605 --> 00:43:33.486]  I'd love to get him in the U.S.
[00:43:33.526 --> 00:43:33.786]  Senate.
[00:43:33.826 --> 00:43:38.608]  Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, thanks for joining us for some big, breaking, exclusive news.
[00:43:38.888 --> 00:43:43.291]  You know, we got this big sign out here, you may have seen it, you know, only the real Indian can defeat the fake Indian.
[00:43:43.591 --> 00:43:57.780]  It's a very powerful meme, Alex, and I want to really explain why it's so powerful and why we put it out there, because it really is an expression of not only my anger, but pretty much everyone's anger at the corruption that is taking place in government.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.821]  And Elizabeth Warren is the face of that corruption.
[00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:07.746]  So when we put that signage up on our bus, the city of Cambridge, which is supposed to be the most liberal haven on the planet, said we had to take it down.
[00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:10.727]  That was on April 5th, 2018.
[00:44:10.767 --> 00:44:11.447]  We didn't do that.
[00:44:11.487 --> 00:44:16.069]  In fact, we retaliated hard and we sued them, took them to federal court and we won.
[00:44:16.429 --> 00:44:19.590]  They surrendered completely.
[00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:23.571]  And, you know, then based on that, we dismissed the court case.
[00:44:23.611 --> 00:44:26.592]  Obviously, the mainstream media did not want to cover our victory.
[00:44:27.113 --> 00:44:29.753]  So what we realize, Alex, the big news is this.
[00:44:30.274 --> 00:44:32.154]  And this is something that's really, really important.
[00:44:32.174 --> 00:44:36.816]  You see, for far too long, the establishment has made politics
[00:44:37.536 --> 00:44:41.179]  A, uh, essentially a, uh, you know, an audience sport, right?
[00:44:41.479 --> 00:44:45.543]  They do not want the everyday citizen to actually be involved in that aspect.
[00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:48.085]  They want to make it the old Hollywood celebrity culture.
[00:44:48.125 --> 00:44:52.428]  You put a couple of people on pedestals and we're supposed to watch them and eat our popcorn.
[00:44:52.488 --> 00:44:56.772]  So what we've done here, Alex, is that's becoming really powerful is we've figured out the victory to winning.
[00:44:56.912 --> 00:44:58.653]  And what we realized was people say, you know what?
[00:44:58.713 --> 00:45:05.839]  You guys have a lot of courage to put that out there because you're bringing out something in Massachusetts that people do not want to talk about.
[00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:08.180]  It's a weaponized way of getting across our message.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.303]  So what we've done is, if you see these magnetic signs here, they're really easy.
[00:45:12.663 --> 00:45:16.365]  So we want to replicate this all over the state, Alex.
[00:45:16.425 --> 00:45:17.506]  In fact, all over the country.
[00:45:18.006 --> 00:45:20.188]  And basically, people can buy these magnetic signs.
[00:45:20.208 --> 00:45:21.989]  You can see as you're showing, being put on.
[00:45:22.629 --> 00:45:23.009]  I think so.
[00:45:37.837 --> 00:45:38.578]  With integrity.
[00:45:38.638 --> 00:45:42.140]  We're talking about someone who did not work hard, who cut in line.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.462]  You, me, Alex, and pretty much every American watching your show works for a living.
[00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:48.323]  You know, I mowed lawns as a kid.
[00:45:48.683 --> 00:45:52.506]  You know, learned to engineer software as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid.
[00:45:52.526 --> 00:45:54.046]  I've been working all my life.
[00:45:54.367 --> 00:45:57.689]  But Elizabeth Warren cut in front of line, and they do not want to discuss that.
[00:45:57.749 --> 00:46:03.312]  So we are bringing up not just a race issue, because for far too long down the street is Harvard University.
[00:46:03.852 --> 00:46:12.734]  The white liberal racists who want us to keep us all on their reservation and plantation have bounded the discussion of race, Alex, and they don't know what to do with us.
[00:46:12.994 --> 00:46:16.034]  Because when we bring up that sign, they'll say, oh, that's racist.
[00:46:16.094 --> 00:46:16.815]  We'll say, really?
[00:46:17.195 --> 00:46:24.156]  And we'll flip it back and we say, look, you're the racist because you're supporting a woman who took advantage of race to get in and when she's not of that race.
[00:46:24.496 --> 00:46:28.717]  How do folks, even if they're not in Massachusetts, how do they get one of these babies?
[00:46:28.917 --> 00:46:29.497]  It's very easy.
[00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:31.239]  You just go to shiva4senate.com.
[00:46:31.479 --> 00:46:32.459]  You can find it right there.
[00:46:32.479 --> 00:46:33.860]  It's called the Road Warrior Kit.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.661]  Go to the store.
[00:46:35.021 --> 00:46:36.202]  Get the Road Warrior Kit.
[00:46:36.222 --> 00:46:36.742]  We've made it.
[00:46:36.982 --> 00:46:38.243]  You get two magnetic stickers.
[00:46:38.263 --> 00:46:39.084]  You get a lawn sign.
[00:46:39.104 --> 00:46:40.145]  You get two bumper stickers.
[00:46:40.705 --> 00:46:41.045]  Oh my god.
[00:46:41.065 --> 00:46:43.087]  You gotta call this Operation Road Warrior.
[00:46:43.107 --> 00:46:43.847]  Is that what you're calling it?
[00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:44.427]  That's what I call it.
[00:46:44.487 --> 00:46:45.548]  It's called Road Warrior.
[00:46:45.808 --> 00:46:46.889]  Be a Road Warrior.
[00:46:47.149 --> 00:46:48.330]  That's getting back.
[00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:52.473]  So if you can't come to and pass out cards, you can't do anything.
[00:46:52.493 --> 00:46:53.293]  You know, you got family.
[00:46:53.493 --> 00:46:54.954]  Hey, I'm fully supporting this.
[00:46:55.475 --> 00:46:56.435]  But I am stealing the idea.
[00:46:56.455 --> 00:46:58.377]  We're gonna launch Operation Road Warrior with our stuff too.
[00:47:05.801 --> 00:47:10.463]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:28.352]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:32.668 --> 00:47:33.649]  Here's the bad news.
[00:47:38.733 --> 00:47:55.047]  The bad news is, Democrats, Socialists, Communists, establishment types, a lot of your academics, I think they're better than everybody, who serve that system, are hell-bent on controlling people's lives.
[00:47:56.124 --> 00:47:59.148]  Because they don't feel like they're successful in their own right.
[00:47:59.588 --> 00:48:02.372]  They crave dominating and manipulating others.
[00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:11.344]  And they are on a planetary warpath to dominate human societies under the world government plan.
[00:48:12.591 --> 00:48:24.240]  And think about how 10 years ago, even when I was reading quotes by Globalist about world government, it still was like this big secret thing, and we were all in the in club, knowing about it, but the media would say we were all liars.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.441]  Now they just go, okay, big deal.
[00:48:26.481 --> 00:48:27.322]  Yeah, we got a world government.
[00:48:28.563 --> 00:48:29.003]  Big deal.
[00:48:29.163 --> 00:48:30.224]  Apple doesn't pay any taxes.
[00:48:30.904 --> 00:48:31.305]  Big deal.
[00:48:31.385 --> 00:48:32.826]  Apple has slave factories.
[00:48:33.466 --> 00:48:34.107]  Yeah, big deal.
[00:48:34.707 --> 00:48:36.669]  We say we're getting rid of the family here in the West.
[00:48:37.209 --> 00:48:37.429]  Yep.
[00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.231]  We think Christians are bad.
[00:48:39.711 --> 00:48:39.911]  Yep.
[00:48:40.852 --> 00:48:41.032]  Yep.
[00:48:45.123 --> 00:48:47.085]  I mean, it's just like, there they are!
[00:48:48.286 --> 00:48:51.508]  Yep, universities are banning all conservative, all Christian speech.
[00:48:51.849 --> 00:48:58.034]  Yep, public schools are saying you can't give out Christmas cards, and you can't say you love God, but everybody else has their free speech.
[00:48:59.415 --> 00:49:00.296]  Everything is twisted.
[00:49:00.956 --> 00:49:02.938]  Everything is the opposite of what it's supposed to be.
[00:49:04.239 --> 00:49:13.887]  And when you talk to these leftists, they'll laugh at you and go, if the camera's not on, and go, of course we're taking over.
[00:49:16.934 --> 00:49:22.879]  And they just see those of us that are awake as dumb because we haven't joined them in the scam.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.601]  You ever seen Project Veritas?
[00:49:25.941 --> 00:49:27.302]  Hundreds and hundreds of videos.
[00:49:27.342 --> 00:49:31.905]  They just walk into five different Democrat Party acorn facilities.
[00:49:31.925 --> 00:49:37.870]  And it's nothing but a giant Democratic Party operation.
[00:49:38.931 --> 00:49:39.711]  Caught laundering money.
[00:49:39.731 --> 00:49:42.393]  They go, yeah, I'm gonna run some underage whores.
[00:49:43.975 --> 00:49:45.296]  Some 15-year-old whores.
[00:49:46.448 --> 00:49:47.489]  We took from their parents.
[00:49:47.509 --> 00:49:55.453]  And they go, great, absolutely, we'll help you do that.
[00:49:56.734 --> 00:50:04.619]  And he's dressed in a pimp outfit with a woman that looks like she's underage.
[00:50:07.621 --> 00:50:13.144]  And then there's just hundreds of other videos where every time they turn the camera on,
[00:50:14.462 --> 00:50:17.625]  They're going, oh, we'll destroy these evil Christians and veterans.
[00:50:17.845 --> 00:50:18.525]  They're scum.
[00:50:18.545 --> 00:50:19.206]  Oh, I hate them.
[00:50:19.526 --> 00:50:21.308]  Oh, they think they're talking people on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:50:21.348 --> 00:50:22.188]  We shadow ban them.
[00:50:22.208 --> 00:50:23.049]  They're so pathetic.
[00:50:23.389 --> 00:50:24.370]  We run everything.
[00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:25.451]  We rule them.
[00:50:26.071 --> 00:50:28.694]  Oh, and oh, Alex Jones is our enemy and Paul Watson.
[00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:29.514]  Oh, we hate them.
[00:50:29.534 --> 00:50:30.175]  Ha ha ha.
[00:50:30.295 --> 00:50:31.156]  We're going to get them.
[00:50:32.197 --> 00:50:33.518]  And then other undercover videos.
[00:50:34.018 --> 00:50:37.121]  Dozens and dozens of videos going, oh, I want a new Lamborghini.
[00:50:37.221 --> 00:50:37.901]  Oh, God.
[00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:39.643]  We sell the baby parts.
[00:50:39.923 --> 00:50:40.844]  They're like, ching ching.
[00:50:41.084 --> 00:50:42.305]  You're like, why do they act like
[00:50:44.087 --> 00:50:47.190]  Who was the bad guy on Catch the Pigeon?
[00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.052]  It was a really stupid cartoon back in the 70s.
[00:50:50.774 --> 00:50:57.522]  Where they fly the airplanes, they're always trying to kill the pigeon, but he's like, he's a bad guy and he has a dog that's bad, that's all muttly, that's always giggling.
[00:50:57.542 --> 00:50:59.524]  And it's like, oh, well, destroy them!
[00:50:59.704 --> 00:51:00.785]  Ah, pure evil's good!
[00:51:01.085 --> 00:51:01.606]  Oh, yeah!
[00:51:02.247 --> 00:51:05.370]  And then you're like, oh, evil people don't actually act like that.
[00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:06.051]  Yeah, they do.
[00:51:10.953 --> 00:51:17.735]  They sit around and they hop around and they rub their hands together and they just see a bunch of people they can rip off and scam.
[00:51:18.455 --> 00:51:23.756]  Because the big corporations go and they hire people that they know will do this stuff.
[00:51:31.077 --> 00:51:32.938]  And that's my final realization is
[00:51:34.775 --> 00:51:35.716]  They've converted.
[00:51:35.996 --> 00:51:54.231]  See, once you get 5-10% of your group to be really evil and corrupt and moral-less, then you can convert almost everybody else in the group very quickly through peer pressure, and they've reached that point where... Dick Dastardly is his name?
[00:51:55.772 --> 00:51:56.112]  Muttley?
[00:51:57.693 --> 00:52:04.279]  So they've figured out that they've got a group of people that are completely corrupt,
[00:52:05.831 --> 00:52:11.892]  And also just love to grandstand in front of everyone, pointing your finger at us, saying, we're bad.
[00:52:19.294 --> 00:52:24.475]  And man, when they're talking about harvesting babies and making millions off of it, it's like they're demon possessed.
[00:52:24.495 --> 00:52:28.435]  They're going, oh, oh, oh.
[00:52:29.656 --> 00:52:31.196]  And you're like, what's up with these people?
[00:52:32.082 --> 00:52:35.744]  Because if you're gonna make money off dead babies, you might as well enjoy it.
[00:52:37.305 --> 00:52:45.731]  See, when you start committing these type of sins against humanity, there's just a slippery slope into oblivion, isn't there?
[00:52:47.532 --> 00:52:52.635]  And then they know that we have a conscience, so they're always manipulating the fact that we have a conscience.
[00:52:52.776 --> 00:52:53.116]  And now,
[00:52:54.417 --> 00:52:56.319]  I haven't even gotten any of the news because this is what happens.
[00:52:56.359 --> 00:53:06.611]  I was in a good mood this morning, worked out everything, came in, knew what I was going to talk about, looked at a couple hundred articles, and I just... It's so sick.
[00:53:06.751 --> 00:53:07.552]  It's so twisted.
[00:53:07.812 --> 00:53:08.813]  It's so out of control.
[00:53:08.913 --> 00:53:10.095]  It's so guaranteed.
[00:53:11.308 --> 00:53:13.929]  That they're coming for our guns, our children.
[00:53:14.289 --> 00:53:16.930]  They are 100% going to start burning down cities.
[00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.890]  They're going to 100% start shooting more cops in the back of the head.
[00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:22.331]  They're going to dump coffee on me and physically attack me.
[00:53:22.391 --> 00:53:23.691]  They're going to attack Trump's family.
[00:53:23.972 --> 00:53:32.454]  They're going to attack, now they're just saying they're going to attack anybody in DHS, any Trump supporters is the talking point from Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Donny Deutch and all of them.
[00:53:36.089 --> 00:53:38.030]  Yeah, James Woods has just come out with a new article today.
[00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:39.030]  Infowars.com.
[00:53:39.071 --> 00:53:40.231]  James Woods warns conservatives.
[00:53:40.571 --> 00:53:41.492]  Get armed and vote.
[00:53:41.752 --> 00:53:42.692]  Your life depends on it.
[00:53:42.952 --> 00:53:43.233]  Yeah.
[00:53:44.013 --> 00:53:45.034]  You know, that's really it.
[00:53:45.954 --> 00:53:47.715]  It's not that I'm even depressed.
[00:53:49.816 --> 00:54:02.962]  My brain and my body is just telling me we crossed the line, we're in the Civil War, and I need to get up here and I need to explain that.
[00:54:04.403 --> 00:54:05.664]  And that's what I'm saying to everybody.
[00:54:07.884 --> 00:54:09.405]  Mike Adams has put out an emergency report.
[00:54:09.425 --> 00:54:10.787]  We're going to post it to Infowars.com.
[00:54:10.807 --> 00:54:11.727]  Want to play it next hour.
[00:54:12.548 --> 00:54:14.890]  An emergency alert that we are now in a civil war.
[00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:15.571]  I agree with him.
[00:54:15.791 --> 00:54:17.472]  And notice, I came out and said that today.
[00:54:17.532 --> 00:54:18.833]  He said that simultaneously.
[00:54:19.074 --> 00:54:20.094]  James Woods said that.
[00:54:20.215 --> 00:54:21.456]  All these historians are saying it.
[00:54:21.756 --> 00:54:22.897]  Some of them famous liberals.
[00:54:23.217 --> 00:54:24.438]  Because it's true.
[00:54:24.838 --> 00:54:27.541]  Rob Reiner said they're in the final battle of the civil war.
[00:54:32.472 --> 00:54:37.896]  And it's even lost on him that we're the Republicans and we're trying to bring people together and they're the ones creating division.
[00:54:40.458 --> 00:54:42.099]  So it's all on NewsWars.com.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.461]  It's not even composing myself.
[00:54:47.102 --> 00:54:49.924]  I have stacks of news documenting everything I've said.
[00:54:50.145 --> 00:54:52.106]  And you're going to hear all this and go, we've been hearing this for years.
[00:54:52.146 --> 00:54:52.947]  Yeah, it's here.
[00:54:55.789 --> 00:55:00.372]  So everybody better gear up and everybody better get aggressive with these leftists.
[00:55:03.764 --> 00:55:19.846]  And I haven't really, you know, my main frustration is I haven't figured out yet, at an intellectual, spiritual, economic, military, political level, what we should do at this point, but I'm like pregnant in thought.
[00:55:23.803 --> 00:55:25.685]  But whoever shoots first loses.
[00:55:26.005 --> 00:55:27.006]  Oh, and that's the big thing.
[00:55:28.307 --> 00:55:37.354]  Just like Night Follows Day, this Red Hen thing that put out the personal info of Sanders and threw him out of the deal and then said, oh, you use your official Twitter to talk about us, that's blah blah.
[00:55:37.374 --> 00:55:38.015]  That's not the law.
[00:55:38.035 --> 00:55:38.575]  It's all made up.
[00:55:39.716 --> 00:55:40.697]  Notice they're the victims now.
[00:55:42.018 --> 00:55:46.142]  Like Night Follows Day, you know, like in the show House of Cards where he throws a brick through his own window.
[00:55:47.142 --> 00:55:59.390]  I mean, everybody knows, you know, wag the dog, all that, in movies, everybody knows, oh, people stage stuff, and in reality, the left's always getting caught putting swastikas on their houses, or fake crosses, burnings in their yards, and 99% of the time it's fake.
[00:56:05.534 --> 00:56:15.821]  Like night follows day, I'm not saying the owner of the Red Hen is gonna stage something against their facility, but, like night follows day, if somebody's smart,
[00:56:18.254 --> 00:56:21.977]  If you want to dedicate something to your country, you need to go sit out in front.
[00:56:22.017 --> 00:56:22.637]  I wish I had the money.
[00:56:22.677 --> 00:56:23.418]  I'd put P.I.s.
[00:56:23.778 --> 00:56:27.161]  If I had billions of dollars, I would sit every day, have teams of P.I.s all over the country.
[00:56:27.181 --> 00:56:28.202]  I'd say, get on this site.
[00:56:28.882 --> 00:56:36.648]  And I would just have P.I.s watch the Red Hen showing somebody firebombs, God forbid, or somebody knocks the windows out, or somebody paints a swastika on the door.
[00:56:36.929 --> 00:56:40.251]  We can follow them to their house, and you know who they're going to be, don't you?
[00:56:41.112 --> 00:56:42.173]  We know.
[00:56:42.613 --> 00:56:45.675]  It'll be something like the Southern Property Law Center, the ADL,
[00:56:46.656 --> 00:56:49.778]  Antifa, which is just college professors in masks.
[00:56:50.458 --> 00:56:52.900]  The Lone Rangers going out and hitting women in the head with bike locks.
[00:56:55.181 --> 00:56:59.543]  But I don't have the personnel to do that or the money.
[00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:06.527]  But I'm telling you, the left is going to hit the red hand in the next 48 hours.
[00:57:06.547 --> 00:57:09.048]  99% chance.
[00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:11.890]  And when they do hit it,
[00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:22.539]  We can blow their operation in another devastating victory if somebody just politely goes and sits there and watches it with a camera rolling.
[00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:23.260]  You will catch them.
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:28.381]  It's just thinking like that that will defeat these people 110%.
[00:57:30.722 --> 00:57:32.103]  I will never eat the red turd.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.300]  And I wish no harm against the red turd.
[00:57:35.801 --> 00:57:36.281]  The red hen.
[00:57:36.921 --> 00:57:37.821]  The red chicken dropping.
[00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:38.881]  Please.
[00:57:38.902 --> 00:57:40.922]  In fact, she even looks like a chicken neck liberal.
[00:57:41.122 --> 00:57:42.302]  In fact, I mean, it's just true.
[00:57:42.323 --> 00:57:43.203]  You know when they're liberals.
[00:57:44.523 --> 00:57:47.624]  I just think... God, please tell me you don't want me in your restaurant.
[00:57:47.844 --> 00:57:48.384]  Please!
[00:57:49.565 --> 00:57:50.605]  You'll go so bankrupt!
[00:57:55.816 --> 00:57:58.918]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:57:58.958 --> 00:57:59.478]  You're on the air.
[00:57:59.498 --> 00:58:00.018]  Thanks for holding.
[00:58:00.439 --> 00:58:01.499]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:58:01.719 --> 00:58:02.340]  Hey, brother.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.000]  Good, man.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:03.821]  Thank you for calling.
[00:58:03.901 --> 00:58:04.461]  Hey, hey.
[00:58:04.561 --> 00:58:08.964]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:58:09.184 --> 00:58:15.568]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:58:15.688 --> 00:58:17.389]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:58:17.489 --> 00:58:23.652]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:58:24.893 --> 00:58:25.893]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:58:25.953 --> 00:58:28.394]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[00:58:28.454 --> 00:58:29.975]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:58:30.355 --> 00:58:31.956]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:58:32.416 --> 00:58:33.136]  And exactly.
[00:58:33.156 --> 00:58:37.438]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:58:37.778 --> 00:58:38.038]  Boom!
[00:58:38.178 --> 00:58:41.019]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:41.619]  It's amazing.
[00:58:41.639 --> 00:58:42.940]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.881]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:56.623]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:58:56.643 --> 00:58:57.143]  Thanks for holding.
[00:58:57.203 --> 00:58:58.144]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:58:58.644 --> 00:59:02.186]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:59:02.246 --> 00:59:10.952]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:59:11.132 --> 00:59:27.272]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[00:59:27.792 --> 00:59:36.318]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:59:36.378 --> 00:59:41.142]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:59:41.282 --> 00:59:46.906]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.721]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:59:57.781 --> 01:00:02.123]  You are the resistance.
[01:00:06.765 --> 01:00:12.687]  Their entire hype-driven system is based on you not thinking and having no memory.
[01:00:16.067 --> 01:00:23.574]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:28.459]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.703]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:00:33.084 --> 01:00:34.645]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.488 --> 01:00:45.375]  What is the one event that made this whole thing news?
[01:00:45.796 --> 01:00:52.446]  When it's been going on for years and years and years and was never news, was never reported, what was it?
[01:00:53.697 --> 01:00:54.958]  That made it news now.
[01:00:55.938 --> 01:01:01.201]  Well, first and foremost was the desire for the media to make it a story.
[01:01:01.421 --> 01:01:05.103]  There is no reporting the news or discovering it.
[01:01:05.243 --> 01:01:06.344]  There is making the news.
[01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:09.205]  That's why I call this a manufactured crisis.
[01:01:09.785 --> 01:01:13.547]  And Boorstin's theory is that it usually happens with an image.
[01:01:14.608 --> 01:01:22.172]  A still photograph or a video that somebody in the media trots out and uses the image
[01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:28.456]  To begin shaping the emotional reaction of consumers of news.
[01:01:28.776 --> 01:01:33.739]  I could sit here all day and tell you about President Trump's new zero-tolerance immigration policy.
[01:01:33.759 --> 01:01:36.721]  The one that's leading to the separation of children from their parents at the border.
[01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:40.563]  And I could help you understand it by maybe quoting numbers or statistics.
[01:01:40.623 --> 01:01:42.645]  I could play sound bites of officials.
[01:01:43.405 --> 01:01:45.647]  Or I could just show you a single picture.
[01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:46.567]  This one.
[01:01:47.188 --> 01:01:51.951]  Of a screaming, terrified, two-year-old little girl wearing a tiny pink jacket
[01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:54.131]  No laces in her shoes.
[01:01:55.332 --> 01:01:56.292]  Stopped at the U.S.
[01:01:56.352 --> 01:01:57.372]  border with her mother.
[01:01:58.033 --> 01:02:05.255]  She is quickly becoming the human face of Trump's new immigration policy, one he says he hates, but is refusing to change.
[01:02:13.277 --> 01:02:13.977]  Are we ready yet?
[01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.418]  How soon do you think we'll be able to get this cut?
[01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:18.519]  Oh, we're going to be done in about four or five hours.
[01:02:20.152 --> 01:02:20.553]  That's good.
[01:02:20.593 --> 01:02:21.493]  We can link that to the press.
[01:02:21.513 --> 01:02:24.075]  They can downlink it on Telstar 401, transporter 21.
[01:02:26.837 --> 01:02:29.980]  And this just in, a news break special report from the Albanian front.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:37.666]  We've just received information that the young Albanian national fleeing in this video is attempting to escape terrorist reprisals in her village.
[01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:48.754]  America has seldom witnessed a more poignant picture of the human race than that which... Fantastic.
[01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:54.662]  Thousands of people protested across Texas yesterday.
[01:02:54.682 --> 01:02:59.846]  They accused the administration of punishing undocumented children by removing them from their parents.
[01:03:00.286 --> 01:03:06.711]  Children and adults are seen huddled together in the building that's divided up into chain-link fencing that looks like a cage.
[01:03:06.731 --> 01:03:11.255]  Trump administration officials have been sending babies and other young children home.
[01:03:12.716 --> 01:03:14.678]  Oh, God.
[01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:18.241]  Mean-spirited, un-American.
[01:03:20.706 --> 01:03:21.587]  I can't do a whoops.
[01:03:21.647 --> 01:03:23.428]  I can't do it.
[01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:24.389]  Whoops.
[01:03:24.529 --> 01:03:28.132]  Look at the graphic of this.
[01:03:28.493 --> 01:03:29.714]  Thank you.
[01:03:47.754 --> 01:03:56.297]  But now the man who claims to be the little girl's father says she was in fact not separated from her mother.
[01:03:56.597 --> 01:03:59.378]  They're extremist, open border Democrats.
[01:03:59.759 --> 01:04:00.579]  This is your life now.
[01:04:00.719 --> 01:04:01.199]  This is us.
[01:04:01.339 --> 01:04:01.999]  This is our country.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.000]  It's real.
[01:04:06.341 --> 01:04:09.983]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:04:16.175 --> 01:04:17.357]  This is an emergency transmission.
[01:04:17.377 --> 01:04:31.518]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy.
[01:04:37.995 --> 01:04:39.036]  There is a war.
[01:04:39.496 --> 01:04:40.497]  It's happening now.
[01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:43.178]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:04:43.739 --> 01:04:45.540]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.781]  We are the resistance.
[01:04:48.241 --> 01:04:49.863]  We are the Infowar.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.582]  Right now is massive Rampage Force.
[01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:07.142]  Go ahead.
[01:05:07.382 --> 01:05:12.966]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:14.267]  I'd done the War Room.
[01:05:14.567 --> 01:05:17.028]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:05:17.048 --> 01:05:18.609]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:05:18.649 --> 01:05:19.270]  I was exhausted.
[01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:22.872]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[01:05:23.192 --> 01:05:27.835]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[01:05:27.935 --> 01:05:29.957]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:05:30.097 --> 01:05:30.657]  Uh, the same thing.
[01:05:30.657 --> 01:05:32.758]  I'm going to put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[01:05:32.838 --> 01:05:34.079]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:05:34.119 --> 01:05:36.341]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:05:36.361 --> 01:05:42.365]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:05:42.645 --> 01:05:43.446]  You can sleep with it.
[01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:48.109]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:05:48.169 --> 01:05:50.971]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:05:51.111 --> 01:05:52.812]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:05:52.932 --> 01:05:53.632]  It really works.
[01:05:53.872 --> 01:05:58.395]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:00.957]  Believe me.
[01:06:13.889 --> 01:06:15.450]  You've found it.
[01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:17.772]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[01:06:18.092 --> 01:06:19.533]  It's the Infowar.
[01:06:19.814 --> 01:06:22.076]  And now, Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.096 --> 01:06:25.499]  There must be some kind of... You deserve a couple of tries, you think?
[01:06:26.352 --> 01:06:27.976]  Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it.
[01:06:28.116 --> 01:06:30.100]  You know what I want to do?
[01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:32.345]  I want to get it finished.
[01:06:33.027 --> 01:06:35.171]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[01:06:53.023 --> 01:06:57.466]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:07:07.432 --> 01:07:08.412]  The American flag!
[01:07:08.532 --> 01:07:12.873]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:16.314]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:07:16.334 --> 01:07:17.534]  I will not let you down.
[01:07:17.954 --> 01:07:20.014]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:07:20.194 --> 01:07:21.975]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:07:21.995 --> 01:07:24.835]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:07:24.955 --> 01:07:31.156]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:07:31.376 --> 01:07:33.077]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:07:33.097 --> 01:07:34.337]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:07:38.271 --> 01:07:46.974]  The message I have today is so intense, is so important, is so huge, that I wasn't putting on an act earlier.
[01:07:47.795 --> 01:07:49.755]  I couldn't even go on air during the first hour.
[01:07:51.536 --> 01:07:58.679]  I had to air some rebroadcast because I've never been someone that has trouble speaking in public.
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.921]  And that's the problem, is that
[01:08:13.337 --> 01:08:30.908]  I've asked the advice of very important people in this country about what we should do, and they asked me what I thought we should do, and told me that I need to go on air and tell everybody what we need to do.
[01:08:32.869 --> 01:08:37.312]  And that's another level to things, and I can't even figure it out.
[01:08:44.198 --> 01:08:50.702]  But Infowars did reboot Americana and laid the groundwork for Trump to come in and Trump knows that.
[01:08:53.023 --> 01:08:59.006]  And so I think I should just open the phones up all week and ask listeners and we should have a whole college level.
[01:08:59.026 --> 01:09:02.448]  When you think of college, I don't mean the modern colleges.
[01:09:04.289 --> 01:09:06.991]  But you know, the old term college meaning a big group.
[01:09:08.362 --> 01:09:12.083]  Brainstorm, think tank discussion about what we're going to do.
[01:09:13.163 --> 01:09:14.823]  Because I don't want to just get up here.
[01:09:14.863 --> 01:09:16.744]  I'm a very decisive person, folks know that.
[01:09:16.884 --> 01:09:33.307]  I don't want to just get up here and say what we've got to do at this level, facing what we face, without laying out what we face, the certainty of it, and then just deciding what we're going to do.
[01:09:33.387 --> 01:09:35.727]  Because we can't be caught flat-footed here.
[01:09:36.958 --> 01:09:37.879]  And we haven't been.
[01:09:38.199 --> 01:09:39.701]  We knew this was coming for a long time.
[01:09:40.241 --> 01:09:49.310]  We're kind of boomeranging around it, or leapfrogging over it, and things are turning around very quickly, but that's accelerating the enemy's timelapse.
[01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:50.151]  Their timeframe.
[01:09:53.534 --> 01:09:54.335]  It is a timelapse.
[01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:56.137]  They're accelerating the timetable.
[01:09:59.289 --> 01:10:11.058]  And I knew, and I told, I had a meeting with one of my friends and people I respect, the advisor yesterday, and he said, no, you'll know the right time to make these announcements.
[01:10:13.219 --> 01:10:14.560]  And I said, I think it's tomorrow.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:18.763]  I think you're going to see news everywhere that people realize we're in a civil war.
[01:10:19.063 --> 01:10:19.684]  It's not coming.
[01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.529]  And there's just so many things I want to say.
[01:10:26.569 --> 01:10:27.830]  I mean, I want to warn
[01:10:28.686 --> 01:10:30.067]  The minions of the left.
[01:10:31.048 --> 01:10:32.268]  And I don't say this meanly.
[01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:33.749]  Go, go look at yourselves.
[01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:35.831]  You look like you're dying.
[01:10:35.871 --> 01:10:37.532]  You look mentally retarded.
[01:10:38.532 --> 01:10:41.374]  You're all super in debt, super stupid.
[01:10:42.034 --> 01:10:43.415]  And I'm not saying people that are in debt are bad.
[01:10:43.435 --> 01:10:47.998]  I'm just saying as a group, you are really been shmucked.
[01:10:49.699 --> 01:10:52.801]  And you're going in a bad direction and you're being used.
[01:10:54.522 --> 01:10:56.864]  But you're so far down
[01:10:58.493 --> 01:11:00.834]  Where you are that you can't turn around it seems.
[01:11:01.714 --> 01:11:03.375]  And so I have a lot of frustration here.
[01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:11.799]  I don't want to have to tell you that you are pathetic.
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.421]  I don't want to sit here but I mean look in the mirror.
[01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:27.244]  You're the losers, and I don't mean because you're overweight or whatever, I'm saying as a group, there is a sickness to you.
[01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:29.145]  A mental failure.
[01:11:30.365 --> 01:11:45.651]  And you're being played and programmed by very vicious, ruthless people, who metaphysically have to tell you what they're doing, so they've all written books and white papers and given speeches, admitting that they put you into this position.
[01:11:53.137 --> 01:12:20.006]  But then there's the realization that we have to triage these people and just count on folks that are already somewhat awake and reach out to them because you've got a bunch of losers who don't have any personal destiny or power in their lives because they gave it over to the system who are mad that they think because we control destiny that we're somehow wrecking their lives because we won't subjugate our will to them.
[01:12:20.307 --> 01:12:21.167]  It's not happening!
[01:12:22.935 --> 01:12:26.317]  I tweeted out a comment by one of our readers on Infowars.com today.
[01:12:26.737 --> 01:12:27.677]  Maybe you guys can pull it up.
[01:12:27.717 --> 01:12:32.660]  It's the one where I said that, you know, the bullies are out there looking for the shark to jump it.
[01:12:34.941 --> 01:12:42.264]  And there's an image with a tweet where the individual points out really who the sides are and who they are and who we are.
[01:12:42.304 --> 01:12:43.425]  It's on Real Alex Jones.
[01:12:46.726 --> 01:12:50.528]  So I've got such bombshell news here and I haven't really gotten to much of it because
[01:12:56.226 --> 01:12:57.447]  I've already told you all this.
[01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:58.747]  You already knew this anyways.
[01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:01.088]  So what's the point of repeating everything?
[01:13:02.309 --> 01:13:05.630]  Instead, we need to decide what we're going to do about it.
[01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:12.053]  I mean, do I need to show you 50 articles on the left saying kill people, attack people, bully people, do this and that?
[01:13:13.494 --> 01:13:14.334]  No, you already know all that.
[01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:15.775]  So what are we going to do?
[01:13:15.995 --> 01:13:17.496]  They've already made their decision.
[01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:18.516]  What are we going to do?
[01:13:18.716 --> 01:13:19.596]  Thanks for finding the tweet.
[01:13:19.616 --> 01:13:21.537]  Please put it back on screen for TV viewers.
[01:13:21.557 --> 01:13:22.558]  I'll read it for radio listeners.
[01:13:23.678 --> 01:13:24.979]  The bullies are looking for the shark.
[01:13:28.939 --> 01:13:31.680]  Trump has the military, said tag team on Infowars.com.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:49.064]  Trump has the military, the police and the armed patriots, tens of millions, former military versus Soros, New World Order movement that has the deep state, Antifa, Muslim terror cells, the MSM, potential urban race riots, don't forget communist Chinese and big bank funding.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.140]  And that's really what it is.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:55.861]  And here's the problem.
[01:13:56.301 --> 01:13:59.761]  They realize they've already lost politically, intellectually, culturally, financially.
[01:14:00.081 --> 01:14:17.985]  So they're so desperate that they are going to push a civil war believing that a bunch of establishment people who are on the fence will side against Trump to acquiesce to the left
[01:14:19.702 --> 01:14:29.327]  Every time you acquiesce, it only puts blood in the water and triggers these corporate bots, they're not even the left, historically, to get that much more crazy.
[01:14:29.427 --> 01:14:33.649]  And so, this is like appeasing a terrorist, or paying off a terrorist.
[01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:40.013]  Trump's been trying to fix the separation of kids from their parents, he's just not letting the Democrats do total release.
[01:14:41.013 --> 01:14:48.437]  And so he's using that as leverage to get immigration fixed, but notice it just made them ten times more crazy when he did that, and start demanding even more.
[01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:52.931]  Now USA Today, print me that.
[01:14:55.752 --> 01:14:58.013]  Says civil war has already begun.
[01:14:59.334 --> 01:15:02.215]  That was the name of my headline for the live show yesterday.
[01:15:04.656 --> 01:15:06.617]  Soft civil war is underway.
[01:15:07.137 --> 01:15:07.897]  It will get worse.
[01:15:10.618 --> 01:15:11.639]  That's my exact quote.
[01:15:13.079 --> 01:15:14.200]  Soft civil war.
[01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:18.251]  And again, why do the globalists hate me?
[01:15:18.351 --> 01:15:26.015]  Because they know I've studied military, I've studied, most of these people in government have positions, they just got their degrees, they don't study anything.
[01:15:27.335 --> 01:15:38.881]  And if you want to know what we're facing, we have globalist, communist Chinese funded traders, literally, stay behind networks, in the government right now, who are
[01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:44.248]  Guaranteed going to start false flagging.
[01:15:44.488 --> 01:15:48.669]  They're going to start blowing up their schools, bombing their universities, attacking their own facilities.
[01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:51.650]  It's, I mean, we're there.
[01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:52.610]  False flag season.
[01:15:53.491 --> 01:15:57.532]  And they're going to blame it on the patriot movement, and then they're going to try to start a physical civil war.
[01:16:02.133 --> 01:16:07.034]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available
[01:16:08.211 --> 01:16:16.392]  Books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:16:18.873 --> 01:16:24.974]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[01:16:26.394 --> 01:16:28.935]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:33.135]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[01:16:34.076 --> 01:16:36.216]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:43.152]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[01:16:45.073 --> 01:16:51.696]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[01:16:52.656 --> 01:16:53.657]  It's up to us personally.
[01:16:55.057 --> 01:17:01.900]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.701]  I expected that to happen.
[01:17:04.881 --> 01:17:06.222]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:17:08.211 --> 01:17:19.117]  I just want to make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I want to make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[01:17:19.838 --> 01:17:21.379]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:33.706]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[01:17:34.286 --> 01:17:36.468]  And we've already come so far together.
[01:17:37.489 --> 01:17:46.517]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[01:17:47.077 --> 01:17:52.502]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[01:17:53.623 --> 01:18:01.490]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:12.008]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[01:18:12.328 --> 01:18:13.970]  That's a conservative estimate.
[01:18:14.971 --> 01:18:17.633]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[01:18:18.434 --> 01:18:20.276]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:25.180]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[01:18:26.281 --> 01:18:37.054]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[01:18:37.114 --> 01:18:41.059]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[01:18:42.483 --> 01:18:43.143]  Our game changing.
[01:18:43.564 --> 01:18:45.064]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[01:18:45.265 --> 01:18:46.425]  The other equation of probiotic.
[01:18:46.465 --> 01:18:50.027]  It's now stronger and a lower price in FullWorthStore.com.
[01:18:50.347 --> 01:18:51.448]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[01:18:51.528 --> 01:18:55.890]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:59.492]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[01:18:59.572 --> 01:19:00.793]  It just does incredible things.
[01:19:01.233 --> 01:19:02.674]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[01:19:02.694 --> 01:19:05.675]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[01:19:05.695 --> 01:19:08.237]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:19:08.757 --> 01:19:13.582]  That's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[01:19:14.202 --> 01:19:25.333]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[01:19:25.793 --> 01:19:30.798]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, the ionized water, stevia, peppermint,
[01:19:31.178 --> 01:19:32.659]  Essential oil and so much more.
[01:19:32.719 --> 01:19:34.000]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.400]  You can swallow it as well.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:42.084]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:42.384 --> 01:19:43.764]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:19:43.804 --> 01:19:53.389]  So, thank you all for remembering Infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:56.771]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:20:05.283 --> 01:20:07.897]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.483 --> 01:20:21.627]  If you could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.
[01:20:21.707 --> 01:20:23.309]  What do you mean, biblical?
[01:20:23.369 --> 01:20:25.612]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
[01:20:25.752 --> 01:20:27.814]  Real wrath of God type stuff.
[01:20:27.894 --> 01:20:29.916]  Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:31.398]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[01:20:31.418 --> 01:20:32.339]  Forty years of darkness.
[01:20:32.419 --> 01:20:33.520]  Earthquakes, volcanoes.
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.062]  The dead rising from the grave.
[01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:36.263]  Human sacrifice.
[01:20:36.323 --> 01:20:37.945]  Dogs and cats living together.
[01:20:37.965 --> 01:20:39.066]  Mass hysteria!
[01:20:41.025 --> 01:20:49.774]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:20:50.575 --> 01:20:51.616]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:20:52.617 --> 01:20:58.904]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:01.807 --> 01:21:03.289]  Everybody feels it at a gut level.
[01:21:05.437 --> 01:21:12.902]  You can also intellectually see it, but there's a train wreck, blindsided feeling, even though you know it's coming, but it's actually here.
[01:21:13.823 --> 01:21:23.869]  Maxine Waters, Donny Deutch, Wolf Blitzer having guests on saying, hey, the guy that shot Congressman Scalise wasn't a monster, he wanted to do something good for America.
[01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:28.272]  And Wolf Blitzer looks at him and nods his head and says, yeah.
[01:21:30.854 --> 01:21:32.795]  And that's their attitude and that's who they are.
[01:21:35.046 --> 01:21:36.207]  And that's what they intend to do.
[01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:54.754]  And then you get Maxine Waters, that monstrous corrupt woman that gave tens of millions to her own husband, his own bank, saying, let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up.
[01:21:55.335 --> 01:21:55.855]  And if you see,
[01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:03.992]  Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up.
[01:22:04.633 --> 01:22:14.321]  And if you see anybody from the cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, like Reginald Denny, you get out and you create a crowd.
[01:22:15.762 --> 01:22:16.403]  Just a mob.
[01:22:17.023 --> 01:22:17.644]  Hey, let's get them.
[01:22:18.244 --> 01:22:20.066]  And you push back on them.
[01:22:20.966 --> 01:22:21.367]  Wow.
[01:22:22.308 --> 01:22:27.112]  And you tell them they're not welcome anymore anywhere, she yelled out Saturday.
[01:22:28.604 --> 01:22:31.326]  And went on to say, target the supporters as well.
[01:22:31.806 --> 01:22:32.906]  And that's the new talking point.
[01:22:32.926 --> 01:22:37.169]  Remember last week I said, now you see the talking point, target the supporters.
[01:22:41.851 --> 01:22:45.293]  Now the brown shirts, for six years, brought Hitler to power.
[01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.314]  And they went out and they intimidated people.
[01:22:48.535 --> 01:22:49.896]  And they beat them up and they shut them up.
[01:22:51.357 --> 01:22:57.300]  And you got a Nazi collaborator who was alive then with the Nazis, Jordan Soros, who's quarterbacking much of this.
[01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:04.087]  He's kind of the starting pitcher, maybe is a better analogy.
[01:23:04.888 --> 01:23:08.673]  They got a lot of generals in their army, but he's one of the main ones.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.345]  And they're using social engineering and they're going ahead right now.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:28.971]  On every program and every show, the Reiner Brothers, Trump is evil like Hitler, supporters are like Hitler, need to be targeted.
[01:23:29.752 --> 01:23:31.634]  Notice, that's on articleinforwars.com.
[01:23:31.654 --> 01:23:32.795]  See, it's a talking point.
[01:23:33.436 --> 01:23:38.501]  To target you, to get in your face, to kick you out of the restaurant.
[01:23:39.394 --> 01:23:49.459]  And you see the videos of white people being attacked, not even wearing red hats, or Trump regalia, and saying, you voted Trump, you voted Trump, you're gonna get your ass kicked now.
[01:23:49.919 --> 01:24:00.665]  And the media goes, oh good, and CNN, when a reporter said, you know, it's wrong for whites to be attacked for being white, the black lady on CNN goes, oh, poor white people!
[01:24:03.446 --> 01:24:07.108]  See, so there's this whole racial base to it as well,
[01:24:08.601 --> 01:24:10.283]  And they're going into overdrive.
[01:24:12.044 --> 01:24:15.487]  So the big question is how do we counter this and what do we do about it?
[01:24:16.508 --> 01:24:18.070]  And I'll be talking about that more in the next segment.
[01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:22.494]  Then I'll go through a briefing of the news and the reports and kind of tie it all together.
[01:24:25.777 --> 01:24:27.739]  But they're making their move.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.182]  And they're making their move in a big way.
[01:24:32.369 --> 01:24:38.614]  And you notice that even when Trump, who's been trying to get immigration reform passed, said, OK, well, we'll stop the practice.
[01:24:38.654 --> 01:24:40.815]  And the girl they claim was separated from her mother wasn't.
[01:24:41.756 --> 01:24:43.678]  And 80 plus percent of the people don't have parents with them.
[01:24:44.558 --> 01:24:45.079]  It doesn't matter.
[01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:47.581]  It's all about we have the moral high ground.
[01:24:47.841 --> 01:24:48.741]  We're the good people.
[01:24:49.082 --> 01:24:50.883]  So we're going to come out and beat you up now.
[01:24:51.604 --> 01:24:55.767]  We're going to break the Border Patrol agent's leg in front of everybody.
[01:24:57.159 --> 01:25:08.071]  This week, as a mob ran over him, as he was trying to make them not block a bus, taking illegal aliens, who came here illegally, to the facility.
[01:25:08.232 --> 01:25:17.903]  I mean, every other country in the world, you just show up and say, you try to show up in dangerous countries, you try to show up in thermal countries and say, I'm just marching across your border, they'll lock your butt up so fast.
[01:25:19.974 --> 01:25:39.842]  They'll torture you, but you've got all these little spoiled babies that love to be on TV and love to feel sorry for themselves and all brought up in victim ideology and all the rest of it, loving it like a high school play they think they're in to go out and scream and bitch and complain when, make no mistake, this is about bringing America down.
[01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:43.437]  It's about imploding the country.
[01:25:43.457 --> 01:25:47.319]  It's about getting rid of our borders right as the global depression hits.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:52.222]  As Trump tries to stop the global depression and collapsing all of these economies.
[01:25:55.184 --> 01:25:57.266]  And just saying we want totally open borders.
[01:26:00.187 --> 01:26:05.511]  So that people fleeing what they were already in can experience what they fled here.
[01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:08.255]  And you ask, what's the point?
[01:26:08.875 --> 01:26:31.362]  It is to bring in a giant, undocumented mob that they can politically control, who are disenfranchised and only living on government handouts, who can be detonated as a political weapon anytime the globalist social engineers need them to.
[01:26:32.462 --> 01:26:36.043]  And that's what you're seeing here is the future of this country being ruled
[01:26:38.646 --> 01:26:51.270]  By unruly mobs that are kept disenfranchised and that are given chips on their shoulders and that are basically brainwashed and inducted into the universities to become the new handlers of the permanent underclass.
[01:26:53.581 --> 01:27:06.844]  And the exact same thing is being done in Europe with 80% of the 10 million Muslims they just brought in being military-age men and 90 plus percent of them in major studies, three, four years after they get to Europe, still don't have jobs and are on welfare.
[01:27:07.044 --> 01:27:13.146]  Because the government will deport you if you actually get a job in Europe or you actually become productive.
[01:27:14.986 --> 01:27:18.247]  If you stay on welfare in your ghetto, baby, you're golden.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.541]  And so, you're watching the real assault on this country.
[01:27:26.601 --> 01:27:26.941]  It's real.
[01:27:28.561 --> 01:27:31.282]  Now, we've got incredible footage, incredible breakdowns coming up.
[01:27:31.502 --> 01:27:36.243]  Watch as hundreds of migrants storm Croatian border fence, screaming Allah Akbar.
[01:27:40.925 --> 01:27:41.965]  It is all coming up.
[01:27:42.025 --> 01:27:43.405]  And again, Albania is Muslim.
[01:27:43.445 --> 01:27:47.146]  It's already taken over much of Serbia, and it wants Macedonia.
[01:27:47.246 --> 01:27:47.927]  It wants everything.
[01:27:48.827 --> 01:27:52.848]  And again, I'm not even against Muslims themselves, but they're being used with their population doubling.
[01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:58.103]  As a political weapon to, again, collapse Europe, collapse Asia.
[01:27:58.603 --> 01:28:01.384]  This is all megacorporations playing this game out.
[01:28:01.464 --> 01:28:02.585]  This is the New World War.
[01:28:03.105 --> 01:28:03.765]  You're witnessing.
[01:28:05.025 --> 01:28:07.466]  And it creates civil wars inside.
[01:28:08.206 --> 01:28:17.789]  So it's all on Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Europewars.com has incredible coverage of all this on the ground in Europe with our reporters, Dan Lyman and others.
[01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:20.450]  But when we come back,
[01:28:21.653 --> 01:28:33.311]  I'm going to get to a bunch of angles of this I haven't covered and I'm going to basically brief the president on what he already knows and brief the public.
[01:28:34.232 --> 01:28:38.093]  And talk about what are we going to do to counter this, and what are we going to do to respond to this.
[01:28:38.193 --> 01:28:54.516]  But, when you have organized groups trying to foment violent revolution against random individuals just because they're Republican Party voters, that's the classic definition of racketeering, civil rights violation, and it's the KKK on steroids, and must be met with law enforcement response.
[01:28:55.377 --> 01:28:57.397]  And that's what I'm saying, is this needs to be dealt with.
[01:29:01.468 --> 01:29:04.933]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:29:05.433 --> 01:29:08.217]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:29:08.738 --> 01:29:14.545]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:29:15.006 --> 01:29:17.789]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:21.954]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:28.402]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:29:28.802 --> 01:29:33.768]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:29:34.505 --> 01:29:37.927]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:29:38.427 --> 01:29:44.971]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:50.313]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:29:50.854 --> 01:29:55.956]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:29:56.537 --> 01:30:00.519]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:11.541]  Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broderick all came out with sexual allegations against Bill Clinton decades ago.
[01:30:11.982 --> 01:30:17.408]  They originated this idea of coming out against someone who's powerful.
[01:30:18.368 --> 01:30:22.050]  But they came out before these other women came out against Harvey Weinstein.
[01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:26.313]  Now, why were they excluded from the hashtag MeToo movement?
[01:30:26.933 --> 01:30:31.636]  They were not included in the Time Magazine article.
[01:30:31.976 --> 01:30:34.758]  None of the women were interviewed.
[01:30:35.678 --> 01:30:45.344]  Are you worried at all that the hashtag MeToo movement may become too partisan and be used as a political weapon?
[01:30:53.212 --> 01:30:56.434]  Let me answer your question.
[01:30:56.514 --> 01:31:04.377]  What about Bobby Ann Williams, who is an African American woman that said Bill Clinton impregnated her?
[01:31:05.978 --> 01:31:07.899]  Justice for Danny Williams!
[01:31:08.139 --> 01:31:11.381]  The answer is, this is not a partisan movement.
[01:31:11.421 --> 01:31:16.183]  The answer is, if you want to talk about before Bill Clinton, let's talk about Anita Hill.
[01:31:23.195 --> 01:31:26.239]  I am raising awareness.
[01:31:26.339 --> 01:31:35.089]  I am raising awareness.
[01:31:35.429 --> 01:31:38.893]  This is a movement about survivors.
[01:31:45.563 --> 01:31:52.545]  A female reporter being assaulted, being pushed, being grabbed, being cussed at, being yelled at by a mob of hateful women.
[01:31:53.085 --> 01:31:57.267]  And if I saw a mob of men, like Antifa does, treating a woman like this, I would be upset.
[01:31:57.307 --> 01:31:58.607]  We've seen them do that all over the country.
[01:31:58.647 --> 01:31:59.487]  The left celebrates it.
[01:31:59.507 --> 01:32:08.270]  So the truth is, they're just a bunch of leftist, globalist, brainwashed women being led by the Democratic Party, bullying the rest of this country and women under their globalist control.
[01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:13.692]  The founder of the MeToo movement basically encouraged this vicious crowd to assault a female reporter.
[01:32:14.352 --> 01:32:17.755]  You can hear the tremor in your voice because these women start to look at you like they want to kill you.
[01:32:17.875 --> 01:32:23.299]  Oh yeah, I mean it became a den of vipers and she sure sucked them on me.
[01:32:23.339 --> 01:32:37.289]  I mean they instantly started cheering with her and it became a big bullying fest and it's like this witch hunt, this mob mentality where somebody can incite violence or hate towards you instantly and that's exactly what she did.
[01:32:37.509 --> 01:32:49.373]  So why is it that her answer wasn't just simply, you know, we do support those women and we do think that, you know, the allegations against Bill Clinton are appalling and we want to support them and extend an arm to them.
[01:32:49.393 --> 01:32:55.555]  And by the way, notice Millie, at first a lot of women, at first a lot of women cheer you, but then they get the marching orders that they shouldn't.
[01:32:55.615 --> 01:32:56.075]  Exactly.
[01:32:56.135 --> 01:32:57.495]  What you said was very reasonable.
[01:32:57.755 --> 01:32:59.376]  She should have just said you were right and that'd be it.
[01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:09.419]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:17.374]  Following other people's opinions!
[01:33:18.524 --> 01:33:20.785]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:33:21.345 --> 01:33:22.905]  Today, it all changes.
[01:33:23.205 --> 01:33:25.686]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:33:25.966 --> 01:33:28.807]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:33:29.047 --> 01:33:33.469]  Einstein says the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:33:33.789 --> 01:33:36.670]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:38.930]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:41.231]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:33:41.711 --> 01:33:43.152]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:33:43.372 --> 01:33:44.272]  We have the resources.
[01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:51.343]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[01:33:51.363 --> 01:33:52.724]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[01:33:52.924 --> 01:33:54.485]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:33:54.525 --> 01:33:55.406]  They say Trump's crazy.
[01:33:55.586 --> 01:33:56.486]  They say I'm crazy.
[01:33:56.666 --> 01:33:58.867]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:33:59.068 --> 01:34:02.710]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:34:04.190 --> 01:34:07.772]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:08.353 --> 01:34:10.134]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:40.628]  The recent migrant hysteria of the left was triggered primarily by this declaration of zero tolerance by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
[01:34:41.431 --> 01:34:51.702]  In the last five months, we have a 314% increase in adults and children arriving at the border fraudulently claiming to be a family unit.
[01:34:52.263 --> 01:34:54.585]  This is obviously of concern.
[01:34:54.605 --> 01:34:59.591]  This is something that was enacted after the Attorney General announced the zero tolerance policy.
[01:34:59.611 --> 01:35:00.392]  This never happened.
[01:35:00.792 --> 01:35:02.833]  That's actually not true.
[01:35:02.913 --> 01:35:09.017]  So the last administration, the Obama administration, the Bush administration, all separated families at them.
[01:35:09.377 --> 01:35:11.218]  They absolutely did.
[01:35:11.278 --> 01:35:15.461]  Their rate was less than ours, but they absolutely did do this.
[01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:16.341]  This is not new.
[01:35:17.902 --> 01:35:19.603]  For this to play out as it is playing out.
[01:35:19.643 --> 01:35:22.504]  Are you intending for parents to be separated from their children?
[01:35:22.524 --> 01:35:24.704]  Are you intending to send a message?
[01:35:25.044 --> 01:35:26.865]  I find that offensive.
[01:35:27.185 --> 01:35:27.365]  No.
[01:35:27.665 --> 01:35:31.407]  Because why would I ever create a policy that purposely does that?
[01:35:31.427 --> 01:35:32.507]  Perhaps it's a deterrence.
[01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:41.073]  And now, right on cue, Frontier American and United Airlines have released statements denouncing something Obama did for years.
[01:35:41.633 --> 01:35:50.559]  Separate children from their parents charged with misdemeanors and, some of them, felonies for refusing to become naturalized citizens the legal way.
[01:35:51.039 --> 01:35:58.144]  Regardless of the fact that towns like Tenensingo, Mexico, use our open-ended border against us, flooding the U.S.
[01:35:58.204 --> 01:36:02.627]  with sex slaves, drugs, and weapons, a multi-billion dollar operation,
[01:36:02.927 --> 01:36:06.109]  But the Democrats would like to pretend nothing like that is happening.
[01:36:06.449 --> 01:36:08.310]  After all, it is an election year.
[01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:19.435]  I led an unannounced inspection of an ICE detention center to witness firsthand the Trump administration's heartless, cruel, and dangerous family separation policy.
[01:36:19.815 --> 01:36:24.857]  Here we are bringing our concerns to the steps of the Capitol once again.
[01:36:25.777 --> 01:36:30.359]  Once again to say to the President of the United States, how low can you go?
[01:36:30.379 --> 01:36:35.141]  This is child abuse, what you are committing against those children.
[01:36:35.561 --> 01:36:37.942]  Those children should be with their moms and their dads.
[01:36:38.323 --> 01:36:48.807]  The United States of America is not and must never be about locking up little children in cages on the southern border.
[01:36:50.017 --> 01:36:53.642]  I'm going to be signing an executive order in a little while before I go to Minnesota.
[01:36:54.222 --> 01:37:00.350]  But at the same time, I think you have to understand we're keeping families together, but we have to keep our borders strong.
[01:37:01.071 --> 01:37:06.758]  We will be overrun with crime and with people that should not be in our country.
[01:37:07.299 --> 01:37:10.922]  Of course, this is how they talk when it's not an election year.
[01:37:37.919 --> 01:37:46.903]  Not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.
[01:37:47.884 --> 01:37:51.765]  The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants.
[01:37:52.405 --> 01:37:55.387]  The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers.
[01:37:56.427 --> 01:38:05.913]  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more, by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.
[01:38:06.053 --> 01:38:11.236]  Very briefly on immigration, there isn't any sensible approach except to do...
[01:38:11.616 --> 01:38:12.896]  By the way, this is the Trump plan.
[01:38:38.166 --> 01:38:40.348]  The numbers have escalated tremendously.
[01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:44.573]  You see a lot of illegal smuggling.
[01:38:45.113 --> 01:38:57.886]  I'm told by the State Department that there are anywhere from 40 to 75 ships either in the construction or on the high seas bringing people illegally into this country.
[01:38:58.567 --> 01:39:08.195]  I think what you see, and you see it in Europe, you see it in Asia, and you're seeing it in this country, is a phenomenon of people who are moving, who are looking for opportunity.
[01:39:08.715 --> 01:39:09.796]  So it's worldwide.
[01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:14.220]  When you come to these two borders, you have to remember a couple of things.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:29.705]  In Mexico, there is no welfare, there is no AFDC, there is no SSI, there is no Medicaid, there is no Social Security, there is no Medicare, and there's a 58 cent an hour minimum wage.
[01:39:30.486 --> 01:39:33.787]  Mexico does nothing to enforce its border.
[01:39:35.066 --> 01:39:38.308]  Any way you slice it, these issues have to be dealt with.
[01:39:38.888 --> 01:39:45.953]  We do have border patrol and immigration laws, and a massive cartel-fueled billion-dollar operation on our border.
[01:39:46.293 --> 01:39:48.855]  And like water and oil, the two don't mix.
[01:39:49.175 --> 01:39:52.557]  This surveillance video shows Mexican congressional candidate Fernando
[01:39:52.637 --> 01:40:03.344]  Roberto Purón posing for a selfie with a supporter after a campaign debate last Friday, when a man walks up from behind, raises a gun, and fires point-blank at the back of his head.
[01:40:03.484 --> 01:40:09.728]  He's now one of 113 candidates and politicians who have been murdered in Mexico just since last September.
[01:40:09.928 --> 01:40:18.313]  The cartels want to eliminate candidates who threaten their ability to kidnap, extort, and smuggle illegal drugs to the world's number one consumer, the U.S.
[01:40:18.353 --> 01:40:20.214]  Miguel Alvarez Flores.
[01:40:20.254 --> 01:40:21.314]  He's 22 years old.
[01:40:21.354 --> 01:40:22.715]  He's the one in that green shirt.
[01:40:22.935 --> 01:40:24.216]  He waved at our camera.
[01:40:24.576 --> 01:40:27.978]  And 18-year-old Diego Hernandez Rivera is next to him.
[01:40:28.018 --> 01:40:36.922]  Now, these two have been charged with murdering a woman known as Genesis, who was found shot to death on the side of Sharpcrest Street in southwest Houston.
[01:40:37.202 --> 01:40:38.583]  Her body found two weeks ago.
[01:40:38.823 --> 01:40:43.625]  That woman still has not been identified, but we've been showing pictures of her rings.
[01:40:43.645 --> 01:40:45.966]  Police still trying to find out who she is.
[01:40:46.466 --> 01:40:57.751]  These guys have also been charged now with kidnapping a 14-year-old girl who ran away from school, and investigators say they held her hostage for more than two weeks and assaulted her.
[01:40:58.331 --> 01:41:00.772]  The only real solution appears to be the U.S.
[01:41:00.832 --> 01:41:10.355]  and Canada somehow eventually aiding in the monumental task of turning the tide on the Third World, Central, and South American culture of corruption and murder.
[01:41:10.796 --> 01:41:15.697]  But that would really anger the globalists twisting their mustaches over at the United Nations.
[01:41:16.197 --> 01:41:25.641]  Their replacement migration plan makes it abundantly clear that they want Europe and the United States to be a subjugated Third World hellhole.
[01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:26.623]  Pronto.
[01:41:27.025 --> 01:41:30.137]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:41:31.650 --> 01:41:32.030]  That's right.
[01:41:32.050 --> 01:41:34.210]  The globalists have to know they're not going to be safe in Kauai.
[01:41:34.230 --> 01:41:35.551]  They're not going to be safe in Switzerland.
[01:41:35.571 --> 01:41:37.091]  They're not going to be safe in Tasmania.
[01:41:37.111 --> 01:41:41.192]  They're not going to be safe on any of these places while they do this to us.
[01:41:41.492 --> 01:41:45.412]  And then they create the policies in the third world on record to collapse them faster.
[01:41:45.472 --> 01:41:50.573]  So I wanted to air that because you see all those clips from just a few years ago and then back 20 years ago.
[01:41:51.133 --> 01:41:53.014]  Democrats saying exactly what Trump's saying.
[01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:55.154]  That's a reasonable policy.
[01:41:55.454 --> 01:41:59.435]  But they've always said they're reasonable, but then sabotaged passing it.
[01:42:00.285 --> 01:42:04.549]  Then they look at Trump, who's trying to fix it, and say he's the bad guy.
[01:42:04.569 --> 01:42:10.274]  And then he says, okay, well we're not really separating many kids from parents, but we'll try to stop doing that.
[01:42:10.828 --> 01:42:15.849]  And they go, oh that's not enough, you're a Nazi, we're gonna go out and physically attack your supporters now.
[01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:21.151]  So Trump's put out a tweet on that, it's very powerful, that I'm gonna read to you here.
[01:42:21.231 --> 01:42:28.193]  It's Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the face of the Democratic Party.
[01:42:28.653 --> 01:42:34.735]  She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement.
[01:42:35.355 --> 01:42:37.336]  Be careful what you wish for, Max.
[01:42:39.025 --> 01:42:40.386]  And I think that's where this is going.
[01:42:40.466 --> 01:42:48.330]  I'm going to tell you what they're planning, and how we stop them, and what I think we should do when we come back, and I'm going to open the phones up, but we're already in a civil war.
[01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:52.292]  I've been telling you that for a few days, and now USA Today says the same thing.
[01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:21.858]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:43:21.958 --> 01:43:27.860]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:28.920]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:43:29.021 --> 01:43:32.202]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[01:43:32.842 --> 01:43:33.802]  And so much more.
[01:43:33.822 --> 01:43:35.503]  It is concentrated.
[01:43:35.743 --> 01:43:37.444]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:43:37.464 --> 01:43:43.166]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:43:43.266 --> 01:43:44.466]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:43:44.486 --> 01:43:46.407]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:43:46.487 --> 01:43:48.888]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:43:49.088 --> 01:43:50.349]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:43:50.529 --> 01:43:52.329]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:53.490]  Immune Wall.
[01:43:53.610 --> 01:43:54.910]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:44:01.593 --> 01:44:04.775]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:44:05.235 --> 01:44:06.556]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:44:07.036 --> 01:44:18.464]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:44:19.264 --> 01:44:28.190]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:44:28.570 --> 01:44:39.278]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:44:39.798 --> 01:44:42.120]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:44:42.461 --> 01:44:43.822]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:44:44.202 --> 01:44:53.812]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:44:53.932 --> 01:44:56.094]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:44:56.615 --> 01:45:01.480]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:45:05.725 --> 01:45:12.384]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:45:13.427 --> 01:45:13.888]  It's you!
[01:45:18.686 --> 01:45:19.127]  I don't know.
[01:45:36.147 --> 01:45:47.751]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the census can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:45:47.811 --> 01:45:57.694]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:45:58.314 --> 01:45:58.975]  We're good to go.
[01:46:18.029 --> 01:46:21.091]  We're following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[01:46:21.471 --> 01:46:23.533]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:46:24.013 --> 01:46:28.956]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is, or what sex we are, or where we came from.
[01:46:29.517 --> 01:46:37.162]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:37.682 --> 01:46:44.387]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:44.727 --> 01:46:46.088]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:46.508 --> 01:46:48.029]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:49.891]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:50.531 --> 01:46:52.213]  And many others are across the world.
[01:46:52.453 --> 01:46:53.213]  We are the future.
[01:46:54.134 --> 01:46:55.075]  We are the renaissance.
[01:46:55.635 --> 01:46:56.896]  And we are winning.
[01:47:04.723 --> 01:47:07.345]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.834 --> 01:47:33.723]  The United States has been leading the world the last year and a half.
[01:47:40.606 --> 01:47:56.154]  Via President Trump's mission to reboot a belief in nation-states, in capitalism, and in human potential, and to free up a lot of the technologies and ideas and systems that have been hoarded by DARPA, and deploying that to the marketplace.
[01:47:56.194 --> 01:48:01.717]  And we've seen America and its economic and cultural system come back from the dead.
[01:48:03.058 --> 01:48:09.361]  And so in my briefing to the President right now, live on air, and to all of you, the viewers and listeners,
[01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:23.187]  It's critical for us to realize this country is on the precipice of artificially induced culture war leading to a civil war.
[01:48:26.403 --> 01:48:34.886]  You notice that in the last year, I've probably put out 50 videos and articles or more with the headline, Left Pushing for Civil Unrest.
[01:48:35.246 --> 01:48:37.427]  Left Pushing for Civil War.
[01:48:38.347 --> 01:48:40.088]  Left Pushing for Civil Emergency.
[01:48:40.148 --> 01:48:49.831]  Because in their policy papers and in their WikiLeaks and in other documents, like the Soros documents we got, planning martial law for Obama in 2015, these are critical.
[01:48:53.402 --> 01:48:59.465]  It shows that if they can't win at the ballot box, they're going to try to create, quote, culture war.
[01:49:00.785 --> 01:49:01.786]  So that is the plan.
[01:49:03.967 --> 01:49:12.870]  Now, we have Maxine Waters and the usual suspects coming out and saying harass Trump supporters.
[01:49:13.491 --> 01:49:19.573]  You have Donny Deutch, you have Rob Reiner, you have all of them at the talking point just since last Friday.
[01:49:19.993 --> 01:49:20.994]  That's when the memo went out.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:26.963]  Saying, if you see them at gas stations, restaurants, get in their faces.
[01:49:28.144 --> 01:49:29.584]  Surround them, push them away.
[01:49:29.665 --> 01:49:36.369]  So, that's like saying if you see black people at a grocery store or at a gas station, get together, push them out.
[01:49:36.549 --> 01:49:39.631]  It is KKK behavior from the 1940s.
[01:49:40.792 --> 01:49:44.734]  Super unacceptable, unacceptable criminal garbage.
[01:49:45.775 --> 01:49:49.057]  Absolutely sick to see them pushing that.
[01:49:50.011 --> 01:49:59.517]  But this is something that they're trying to make acceptable today against people of every race, color, and creed who happen to support capitalism, free market systems.
[01:50:01.298 --> 01:50:06.241]  So suddenly, you've seen the media criticize me in George Soros' outfit, Media Matters, and others.
[01:50:06.541 --> 01:50:08.302]  Say, oh, Jones claims he wants civil war.
[01:50:08.362 --> 01:50:10.163]  Jones claims he wants civil insurrection.
[01:50:10.223 --> 01:50:11.004]  None of that's going to happen.
[01:50:12.265 --> 01:50:13.666]  But that's indeed what they're pushing.
[01:50:14.866 --> 01:50:17.368]  And so now, is America headed towards a civil war?
[01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:21.782]  Incidents show it's already begun.
[01:50:21.802 --> 01:50:25.326]  That's word for word what I've been saying for months.
[01:50:30.372 --> 01:50:31.653]  Newswars.com.
[01:50:31.734 --> 01:50:35.198]  Historian links current political environment to pre-Civil War.
[01:50:37.185 --> 01:50:39.006]  James Woods, up on Infowars.com.
[01:50:39.487 --> 01:50:40.788]  Critical article by Jamie White.
[01:50:41.508 --> 01:50:44.310]  James Woods warns conservatives, get armed and vote.
[01:50:44.490 --> 01:50:46.351]  Your life depends on it.
[01:50:46.812 --> 01:50:51.375]  Violence inevitable following Maxine Waters' calls to intimidate Trump supporters, he says.
[01:50:52.316 --> 01:50:57.539]  And again, the President's been trying to fix the broken immigration system.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:00.601]  The Democrats didn't say, no, we want totally open borders or nothing.
[01:51:00.822 --> 01:51:02.142]  And that's what we need to understand here.
[01:51:03.163 --> 01:51:05.605]  As citizens, as the President, as everyone.
[01:51:07.816 --> 01:51:19.119]  The Democrats are just ruthless minions of the Chinese communists, the globalists, the Hollywood combines that want to control and dominate America and don't want a free market system.
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:33.182]  And they are pushing a confrontation that they believe will create a crisis that allows them to create so much destabilization that the American people will capitulate.
[01:51:34.258 --> 01:51:37.760]  And that the American people will give in to whatever their list of demands are.
[01:51:39.201 --> 01:51:43.044]  And so I know why the President said, sure, there's hardly any kids getting separated anyways.
[01:51:43.364 --> 01:51:45.545]  The girl they showed wasn't ever separated from her mother.
[01:51:45.785 --> 01:51:46.466]  It's all a lie.
[01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:49.067]  The Democrats have said invade the U.S.
[01:51:49.087 --> 01:51:49.488]  The U.N.
[01:51:49.528 --> 01:51:50.689]  is down there quarterbacking it.
[01:51:51.049 --> 01:51:52.530]  George Soros is heavily involved.
[01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:55.752]  We have a 300 plus percent increase in children coming in and adults.
[01:51:57.031 --> 01:52:04.433]  And so we've got to shut it down or it's going to trigger an even bigger exodus out of the third world into the U.S., just like the U.N.
[01:52:04.453 --> 01:52:06.293]  and others triggered in the last five years in Europe.
[01:52:07.153 --> 01:52:08.813]  So Trump's doing the exact right thing.
[01:52:09.113 --> 01:52:21.476]  And he thought he would take the piss out of them, as it's called in the U.K., take the impetus, take their propaganda, their hysteria, their delusion, by saying, OK, we won't separate them.
[01:52:21.496 --> 01:52:24.137]  Because they said, sir, we're hardly separating anybody from their parents.
[01:52:24.517 --> 01:52:25.677]  We have family centers and
[01:52:26.977 --> 01:52:29.898]  He found out the numbers of maybe a few hundred a week that are questionable.
[01:52:30.398 --> 01:52:34.138]  So now they just put them in a holding tank and observe them while they double check.
[01:52:34.158 --> 01:52:35.919]  And then if it's not apparent, then they separate them.
[01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:37.759]  I was wondering how they do that.
[01:52:37.779 --> 01:52:38.499]  I went and did research.
[01:52:38.519 --> 01:52:39.139]  That's how they're doing it.
[01:52:39.159 --> 01:52:40.780]  It's going to take some extra personnel.
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:44.160]  They're going to have to get the military involved because they don't have the personnel for that.
[01:52:45.041 --> 01:52:46.121]  But that's what's going to happen.
[01:52:46.621 --> 01:52:46.981]  We're OK.
[01:52:47.001 --> 01:52:49.001]  We'll put people, little kids, in with rooms.
[01:52:49.401 --> 01:52:50.362]  We don't know who these people are.
[01:52:50.782 --> 01:52:53.042]  We pick up 50 folks, six or seven little kids.
[01:52:53.902 --> 01:52:55.583]  We'll put them in general population.
[01:52:55.603 --> 01:52:56.283]  We're going to watch them.
[01:52:57.113 --> 01:52:59.434]  While we pull one out at a time and find out who they are.
[01:53:01.374 --> 01:53:03.855]  It'll be traumatic for little kids, but you'll get what you want left.
[01:53:04.855 --> 01:53:06.036]  Did that make them leave?
[01:53:06.376 --> 01:53:09.717]  No, it made them go into foaming at the mouth overdrive.
[01:53:10.977 --> 01:53:21.060]  Now, this tactic worked when the president did it a few months ago, when he said, okay, Pelosi, okay, Waters, okay, tell me what you want.
[01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:25.211]  And they said, we want all the guns.
[01:53:25.251 --> 01:53:26.131]  We want total ban.
[01:53:26.431 --> 01:53:28.092]  Well, that blew up in their face and went away.
[01:53:28.172 --> 01:53:29.313]  So that worked that time.
[01:53:30.073 --> 01:53:34.255]  And Ted Nugent told me on record, and a lot off the record, but he said, look, I've talked to the White House.
[01:53:34.635 --> 01:53:35.856]  They said, just trust us on this.
[01:53:35.916 --> 01:53:38.877]  It's a tactic where we say, OK, what do you want?
[01:53:39.337 --> 01:53:39.918]  We'll do it.
[01:53:40.378 --> 01:53:42.519]  And they say, we want to ban all the guns.
[01:53:42.839 --> 01:53:44.039]  We want an end to the Second Amendment.
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:44.920]  Remember that?
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:51.563]  New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, Democratic congressmen, we want total ban.
[01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:55.251]  Trump hit a hole in one with that one.
[01:53:56.392 --> 01:54:04.219]  And I've talked to folks that were in the room when Trump just said, let me try this on them.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.521]  And it worked perfectly.
[01:54:07.862 --> 01:54:08.783]  And he wasn't being dishonest.
[01:54:08.823 --> 01:54:10.345]  He said, yeah, tell us what you want.
[01:54:10.465 --> 01:54:11.085]  We'll listen.
[01:54:11.125 --> 01:54:11.806]  We might do it.
[01:54:12.266 --> 01:54:13.327]  Congress will have to vote.
[01:54:13.748 --> 01:54:14.889]  He said it right in front of him, too.
[01:54:15.329 --> 01:54:19.453]  Congress has got to vote, but I'm for listening to whatever you want.
[01:54:20.854 --> 01:54:24.955]  And they all, and remember, Pelosi rubbed her hands together like a demon?
[01:54:25.816 --> 01:54:27.836]  That wasn't Pelosi, it was Feinstein.
[01:54:32.578 --> 01:54:33.078]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:54:33.098 --> 01:54:38.620]  The New York Times admits later, she became a face of family separation at the border, but she's still with her mother.
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:46.503]  The New York Times, four, five, six days later, goes back and says, oh, she is with her mother, so they can kind of save face.
[01:54:51.087 --> 01:54:52.768]  But now they've already launched the hysteria.
[01:54:53.969 --> 01:55:03.836]  Now they've already launched the craziness for the low IQ people that are out there trying to kill Republicans and beat up Trump supporters and attack me when I'm out in public.
[01:55:05.777 --> 01:55:06.858]  So the bottom line is this.
[01:55:07.138 --> 01:55:08.779]  They have already launched a civil war.
[01:55:09.539 --> 01:55:12.762]  And so we have to have serious discussions about what do we do.
[01:55:13.882 --> 01:55:19.106]  Now clearly Trump thinks, or the President thinks rightfully, that it's going to backfire on them, as he says in his tweet.
[01:55:20.663 --> 01:55:25.125]  When they engage in violence against people.
[01:55:25.165 --> 01:55:27.987]  The media is going to be there trying to spin that and trying to cover that up.
[01:55:28.147 --> 01:55:34.370]  And they want a conservative, a libertarian, a nationalist, a populist, a capitalist response.
[01:55:36.211 --> 01:55:39.613]  So that they can rationalize an even bigger crisis.
[01:55:40.313 --> 01:55:43.255]  The globalists don't care that their constituents are idiots and will get hurt.
[01:55:43.995 --> 01:55:45.956]  They just simply want a bigger crisis.
[01:55:46.016 --> 01:55:47.837]  And I know everybody knows that.
[01:55:49.636 --> 01:56:01.484]  We just have to be honest as a citizenry and as a culture about the point and time we're in and realize that the left isn't ever going to stop.
[01:56:02.705 --> 01:56:04.266]  They're not ever going to back down.
[01:56:04.606 --> 01:56:09.990]  They're not ever going to quit because they are financed by foreign money.
[01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:15.414]  And our media and our tech giants and everything have been taken away from us and are captured.
[01:56:16.198 --> 01:56:23.804]  And just because then we get control of the executive branch isn't enough to turn this around.
[01:56:23.844 --> 01:56:39.417]  And so we have to have a serious discussion about what we're going to do for our families because there is a clear and present danger now on every front that they are going to pull out all the stops.
[01:56:39.977 --> 01:56:42.319]  And that doesn't just mean rioting and calling for violence.
[01:56:42.359 --> 01:56:43.860]  That means false flagging themselves.
[01:56:44.661 --> 01:56:45.742]  That means everything.
[01:56:48.607 --> 01:57:04.552]  And so, you have to understand that we've got a bunch of cowards in Congress, and a bunch of old blue blood country club folks, who Trump's trying to replace, but they're still in power in many cases, and they're ready to capitulate and run the white flag up anytime.
[01:57:05.632 --> 01:57:14.575]  They want to stop this worldwide populist movement that's defeating them in every country, and they think if they can beat it here, that'll be the beta test to beat it everywhere.
[01:57:14.655 --> 01:57:16.056]  But Trump understands that,
[01:57:17.017 --> 01:57:37.541]  So he's on the phone every few days with patriot leaders in Latin America, in Asia, in Eastern Europe big time, and in Western Europe, and understands this is a worldwide revolution against the big mega-bank authoritarian systems that we are facing.
[01:57:38.921 --> 01:57:42.222]  All right, we'll be back on the other side with more of the breakdown.
[01:57:44.967 --> 01:57:46.745]  That's not even my message, it's just unbelievable.

[01:59:58.071 --> 01:59:59.412]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:03.193 --> 02:00:06.074]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:06.114 --> 02:00:09.535]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[02:00:09.595 --> 02:00:09.895]  Coming up!
[02:00:09.935 --> 02:00:13.516]  The next segment, we've got a compilation.
[02:00:21.570 --> 02:00:23.791]  Of all these globalists saying they're going to overthrow Trump.
[02:00:24.892 --> 02:00:42.203]  So, that's the message the President's got to get out, is that losers from the election, criminal deep state folks through the media, are fomenting these hoaxes to cause a civil war in America, and the President needs to reach directly out to the brainwashed people, but also to his constituents, to understand what's happening.
[02:00:43.184 --> 02:00:44.345]  But first, this key report.
[02:00:45.523 --> 02:00:47.984]  The thought that he is now responsible for keeping America safe,
[02:01:14.631 --> 02:01:22.433]  And yet, when you use a word like infested with immigrants, that's not a good sign.
[02:01:22.873 --> 02:01:24.153]  Well, it's not who we are.
[02:01:24.833 --> 02:01:28.214]  And the good news is, we know that about ourselves.
[02:01:28.294 --> 02:01:30.214]  I think our British colleagues know it about us.
[02:01:30.254 --> 02:01:31.234]  We're better than that.
[02:01:32.314 --> 02:01:37.535]  And no president in a four-year term or an eight-year term can essentially change America.
[02:01:37.555 --> 02:01:40.376]  That doesn't mean it's not painful and concerning in the short term.
[02:01:41.047 --> 02:02:07.878]  Earlier this week, a clearly biased and treasonous FBI agent, Peter Strzok, was removed from his office and placed under investigation by the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, as the Justice Department revealed in Inspector General Horowitz's IG report that Strzok and four other FBI employees sent hostile anti-Trump messages using taxpayer-funded bureau devices, a violation of FBI rules.
[02:02:07.978 --> 02:02:15.321]  This text from Peter Strzok, who basically says, you know, he says to his girlfriend, we will stop it.
[02:02:15.802 --> 02:02:19.123]  And this text happened on August 8th of 2016.
[02:02:19.543 --> 02:02:23.165]  Four days later, we get the other text that says we need an insurance policy.
[02:02:23.465 --> 02:02:27.827]  We've had the insurance policy text for months, and yet we're just getting this one now.
[02:02:27.987 --> 02:02:37.712]  But when the FBI agent says he's going to stop it, that sounds like collusion at the highest level and an attempt to improperly interfere
[02:02:38.152 --> 02:02:43.494]  With a legitimate election, Congress is entitled to know everything about that in real time.
[02:02:43.915 --> 02:02:45.555]  But don't count your chickens just yet.
[02:02:45.915 --> 02:02:54.919]  Inspector General Horowitz confirmed that he is investigating if Strzok's anti-Trump bias played a role in the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation.
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:03:02.423]  And further evidence regarding gifts the FBI agents received from reporters has yet to be completely revealed.
[02:03:02.543 --> 02:03:07.085]  As detailed in our report, we found that the inappropriate political messages we uncovered
[02:03:07.765 --> 02:03:17.953]  Cast a cloud over the Midyear investigation, sowed doubt about the credibility of the FBI's handling of it, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.
[02:03:19.434 --> 02:03:34.806]  We found the implication that senior FBI employees would be willing to take official action to impact a presidential candidate's electoral prospects to be deeply troubling and antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the Justice Department.
[02:03:35.973 --> 02:03:46.921]  And also, The Hill reports Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley wants to subpoena former FBI Director James Comey and Loretta Lynch, who served as Attorney General in the Obama administration.
[02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:55.563]  This is the second time since he was fired that Mr. Comey refused an invitation to testify here voluntarily.
[02:03:56.523 --> 02:04:07.947]  He has time for book tours and television interviews, but apparently no time to assist this committee, which has primary jurisdiction over the Justice Department.
[02:04:08.727 --> 02:04:08.947]  Ms.
[02:04:09.027 --> 02:04:10.928]  Lynch also chose not to show up.
[02:04:11.808 --> 02:04:17.490]  The need for transparency does not end when senior officials are fired or quit.
[02:04:18.439 --> 02:04:46.834]  If the IG report were to be taken seriously by the Country Club of Backscratchers in the District of Criminals, not only would Hillary be finally brought front and center to answer to her lackey James Comey's watered-down bungling of her treasonous crimes against national security, but Obama himself, or another senior official as Comey disguised him, would be entangled in Hillary's still unresolved email scandal as Obama absolutely improperly communicated
[02:04:46.934 --> 02:04:47.314]  That's right.
[02:04:47.334 --> 02:04:48.615]  They are so desperate.
[02:04:48.676 --> 02:04:49.356]  We're winning.
[02:04:49.396 --> 02:04:51.078]  That's why they're pushing this giant hoax.
[02:04:51.118 --> 02:04:54.360]  They're on their last legs, but they're most dangerous now.
[02:04:54.921 --> 02:04:55.481]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.501 --> 02:04:58.284]  I'm going to get to a critical report in 60 seconds.
[02:05:03.008 --> 02:05:05.329]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:05:05.349 --> 02:05:07.091]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:05:54.333 --> 02:05:56.894]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:05:57.634 --> 02:05:59.615]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.

[02:06:27.975 --> 02:06:31.756]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.876 --> 02:06:35.378]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[02:06:35.398 --> 02:06:43.620]  A new world order.
[02:06:44.561 --> 02:06:53.764]  I remember on the night of November 8, 2016, sitting right here with Roger Stone in this studio, we're broadcasting from and saying,
[02:06:55.581 --> 02:06:57.202]  Our battle is just beginning.
[02:06:57.662 --> 02:07:05.485]  We have won a major fight, but there are many, many other major battles that take place before we win this war.
[02:07:06.345 --> 02:07:16.709]  And I could feel the energetic, psychic hatred and energy of the slaves of globalism and the masters of it.
[02:07:18.106 --> 02:07:19.507]  And you can see it today.
[02:07:19.567 --> 02:07:26.769]  I mean, this was about planetary control of technology, dominating populations, dumbing people down, making people poor.
[02:07:26.789 --> 02:07:30.731]  And they've been caught staging riots at Trump events and blaming him.
[02:07:30.751 --> 02:07:32.251]  And they've been caught rigging the polls.
[02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:35.733]  And they've been caught engaging in all the race baiting.
[02:07:36.893 --> 02:07:40.615]  They've been caught with the secret servers in Benghazi and all the corruption.
[02:07:40.995 --> 02:07:43.776]  And the fact that they wanted to make America poor to control us.
[02:07:46.089 --> 02:07:48.190]  And what's the common sense analysis?
[02:07:48.711 --> 02:07:50.492]  They're not going to capitulate.
[02:07:52.013 --> 02:07:54.915]  They're not gonna roll over and let America be great again.
[02:07:54.935 --> 02:08:04.862]  They're not going to do that because they are financed by ruthless big banks and the communist Chinese and America haters in Hollywood who admittedly are in a combine.
[02:08:06.633 --> 02:08:15.139]  Against America and against any sovereign wealthy nation, whether it be Australia, whether it be Japan, whether it be Russia, whether it be Germany.
[02:08:15.579 --> 02:08:23.545]  You can look at all these countries, some captured, some not, by the globalists and realize they're not bad people, they're just hijacked by these controllers.
[02:08:25.424 --> 02:08:31.089]  And along comes Trump, right on the crest of the Brexit wave, the first move.
[02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:36.114]  And then he's the big tsunami coming in, and now it's happening everywhere in a chain reaction.
[02:08:36.474 --> 02:08:39.076]  And so the globalists are trying to put on a confidence act.
[02:08:39.276 --> 02:08:40.678]  And here's my real message to the president.
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:48.385]  Your enemies are putting on a confidence act when they go on TV and Phil Mudd says, he's going to kill you.
[02:08:49.457 --> 02:08:54.280]  And when Brennan goes on back in July of last year and says you'll be out of office by December.
[02:08:55.041 --> 02:09:07.009]  And when they go out and all these other spokespersons get up there and say that don't do what Trump says, resist him, mutiny.
[02:09:08.191 --> 02:09:09.292]  That is their weakness.
[02:09:09.332 --> 02:09:10.273]  That is their desperation.
[02:09:10.633 --> 02:09:18.440]  So now that they would hoax everybody that you're doing bad things to people's kids when you're following a decades-old policy and trying to even make it better.
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:25.586]  And even when you then give in to what they want, they even get more shrill because they have nothing and they're not going to stop.
[02:09:26.507 --> 02:09:29.169]  And they're going to try to create a civil war.
[02:09:29.329 --> 02:09:31.851]  And that's why Maxine Waters is calling for attacks.
[02:09:32.711 --> 02:09:33.431]  I don't think so.
[02:09:57.861 --> 02:10:03.045]  Pelosi and all these people like Waters say that rioting is a defining moment.
[02:10:03.065 --> 02:10:07.048]  Remember Newsweek a few years ago had the headline, The Case for Rioting?
[02:10:10.211 --> 02:10:11.872]  So that's where we are now.
[02:10:12.253 --> 02:10:16.396]  And yes, it sounds radical to say that's happening.
[02:10:19.401 --> 02:10:23.225]  And even some people in the White House criticize the President when he calls it what it is.
[02:10:23.285 --> 02:10:24.486]  It says CNN's the enemy.
[02:10:25.167 --> 02:10:26.368]  The Democrats hate America.
[02:10:26.608 --> 02:10:27.709]  The NFL hates America.
[02:10:27.929 --> 02:10:29.511]  They do, at the top.
[02:10:30.052 --> 02:10:31.613]  That's their globalist cult.
[02:10:31.873 --> 02:10:33.235]  That's how you get admittance to the club.
[02:10:33.615 --> 02:10:36.398]  So my advice to the President is keep being Donald John Trump.
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:53.445]  And come out and address the nation straight on about how you want unity and prosperity for everybody and how the deep state is openly trying to foment this because we got Hayden and everybody launching it two weeks ago that you're a Nazi and we're all Nazis and we all deserve to be targeted.
[02:10:53.665 --> 02:10:55.546]  That's a criminal civil rights violation.
[02:10:55.886 --> 02:10:56.786]  It's racketeering.
[02:10:57.386 --> 02:10:58.647]  It's classically illegal.
[02:10:59.007 --> 02:11:00.007]  It's organized crime.
[02:11:00.867 --> 02:11:04.729]  And we should all have a debate about what we're going to do to counter this.
[02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:07.331]  But they've already taken the gloves off.
[02:11:07.411 --> 02:11:08.512]  They've drawn first blood.
[02:11:09.353 --> 02:11:11.415]  I want to counter them legally and lawfully.
[02:11:11.795 --> 02:11:15.398]  But to do that, we've got to realize we're up against such extreme enemies.
[02:11:15.639 --> 02:11:26.509]  Now here's a compilation in the last year and a half of these globalists trying to look cocky and powerful in public and trying to push your overthrow and the voters' election overthrow.
[02:11:29.184 --> 02:11:31.505]  It's obvious that he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[02:11:32.325 --> 02:11:35.146]  It's obvious he can't control his mind or his tongue.
[02:11:36.006 --> 02:11:47.269]  And what I've suggested, if now, because he's the nominee for the party, and he gets, he's entitled to briefings from the CIA, for example, I told, I said publicly, give him fake briefings.
[02:11:47.670 --> 02:11:48.610]  Pretend you're briefing him.
[02:11:48.650 --> 02:11:50.790]  Don't tell him anything that you don't want to get out.
[02:11:50.931 --> 02:11:51.911]  He's taking these...
[02:11:52.991 --> 02:11:55.712]  This antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community.
[02:11:55.732 --> 02:12:00.774]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[02:12:01.334 --> 02:12:06.796]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[02:12:08.336 --> 02:12:16.699]  If he's fired, and he's the President of the United States, he could tell Rosenstein to fire him if he wants, but if he's fired, what would you want Congress to do?
[02:12:18.066 --> 02:12:26.790]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is all about.
[02:12:27.791 --> 02:12:33.413]  But I would just hope that this is not going to be a partisan issue.
[02:12:34.114 --> 02:12:41.237]  That Republicans and Democrats are going to see that the future of this country is at stake, and there needs to be some things done for the good of the future.
[02:12:41.377 --> 02:12:42.178]  One bottom line.
[02:12:42.478 --> 02:12:44.879]  As a former government official, government's going to kill this guy.
[02:12:45.439 --> 02:12:52.546]  I don't know when people, those in the Republican Party who continue to apologize and make excuses for Mr. Trump, when they're going to come to their senses.
[02:12:52.646 --> 02:12:55.028]  This is a dangerous, dangerous act.
[02:12:55.328 --> 02:12:57.450]  It's not just his statements or his tweets.
[02:12:57.510 --> 02:13:07.699]  This is an action that puts at risk our national security as well as the stability and security of the Middle East as best it can happen.
[02:13:07.959 --> 02:13:08.560]  I think that's...
[02:13:10.182 --> 02:13:14.967]  Actually, very disturbing assault on the independence of the Department of Justice.
[02:13:15.308 --> 02:13:27.262]  And I think when the president, this president or any president, tries to use the Department of Justice as kind of a private investigatory body, that's not good for the country.
[02:13:27.742 --> 02:13:41.550]  First of all, I think this is a regrettable characteristic of President Trump, where he will attack people whom he considers a threat.
[02:13:41.771 --> 02:13:44.172]  The President's talking about basically corruption at the end.
[02:13:44.172 --> 02:13:44.752]  We're good to go.
[02:14:02.541 --> 02:14:08.405]  And they're going to be saying, I guarantee it, you think you can push us off this because you can try to intimidate the director?
[02:14:08.785 --> 02:14:10.527]  You better think again, Mr. President.
[02:14:10.567 --> 02:14:12.088]  You've been around for 13 months.
[02:14:12.168 --> 02:14:12.948]  We've been around since 1908.
[02:14:13.068 --> 02:14:16.251]  I know how this game is going to be played.
[02:14:16.311 --> 02:14:16.951]  We're going to win.
[02:14:16.971 --> 02:14:26.258]  Disturbing, at least to me, when the institutions of ours that have served us long and well are under attack.
[02:14:26.318 --> 02:14:27.078]  And I thought the
[02:14:28.439 --> 02:14:42.675]  Characterizing the 37,000 men and women of the FBI that they are in tatters, even worse presumably than the heyday of J. Edgar Hoover, was absolutely egregious.
[02:14:43.416 --> 02:14:48.782]  Basically now a press release that's been put out, that's been twisted and mangled, that now will give this president
[02:14:49.483 --> 02:14:53.626]  Permission to fire Rosenstein, who will now take over this investigation.
[02:14:53.986 --> 02:14:55.347]  Our democracy is under siege.
[02:14:55.927 --> 02:14:57.968]  People need to start taking to the streets.
[02:14:58.048 --> 02:14:59.589]  This is a dictator.
[02:14:59.869 --> 02:15:01.550]  This is not something to analyze anymore.
[02:15:01.570 --> 02:15:03.972]  This is not a, oh, a good day for Trump.
[02:15:04.752 --> 02:15:07.694]  This is frightening stuff if you are an American.
[02:15:07.734 --> 02:15:09.935]  This is not time to analyze and pundit.
[02:15:10.296 --> 02:15:12.377]  People, this is a, we need a revolution at this point.
[02:15:12.597 --> 02:15:15.279]  And I'm not doing TV here, and I'm not going, ooh, crazy doggy!
[02:15:15.359 --> 02:15:29.087]  It is the most powerful position in the world, the president of the United States, and his continual lying, as well as lack of ethics, as well as lack of rigor in terms of the policies that he pursues.
[02:15:29.287 --> 02:15:37.833]  But these are abnormal times, and he is an abnormal president, and not in... He's aberration, and not in a good way.
[02:15:38.413 --> 02:15:41.435]  That's what gives us the motivation to speak out.
[02:15:42.055 --> 02:15:52.504]  If you vote for Trump, then you, the voter, you not Donald Trump, are standing at the border, like Nazis, going, you here, you here.
[02:15:52.824 --> 02:15:56.427]  And I think we now have to flip it, and it's a given the evilness of Donald Trump.
[02:15:56.447 --> 02:15:57.328]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:57.348 --> 02:15:59.890]  They're losing and they know it, but they're more dangerous than ever.
[02:16:00.936 --> 02:16:19.605]  We call it the- It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the US Navy had less than 10 major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the US Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[02:16:23.047 --> 02:16:26.008]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[02:16:27.049 --> 02:16:27.789]  But he didn't give up.
[02:16:29.070 --> 02:16:29.530]  And he won.
[02:16:31.251 --> 02:16:32.672]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[02:16:33.433 --> 02:16:37.535]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given the victory.
[02:16:38.776 --> 02:16:41.998]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[02:16:43.118 --> 02:16:44.019]  And they all died.
[02:16:44.259 --> 02:16:45.080]  All 180 plus men.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:50.983]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[02:16:52.584 --> 02:16:56.807]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[02:16:57.947 --> 02:16:58.628]  But I know this.
[02:17:01.167 --> 02:17:21.452]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance, I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[02:17:22.952 --> 02:17:26.653]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[02:17:27.573 --> 02:17:35.116]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[02:17:37.516 --> 02:17:46.999]  But that said, just like our information is game-changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[02:17:49.403 --> 02:17:52.745]  And whether it's colloidal silver for $19.95, the very best out there.
[02:17:53.766 --> 02:17:55.887]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[02:17:56.267 --> 02:17:58.508]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[02:17:59.829 --> 02:18:00.149]  PQQ, CoQ10.
[02:18:02.597 --> 02:18:10.204]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[02:18:10.604 --> 02:18:12.325]  They sell PQQ in little bottles.
[02:18:12.706 --> 02:18:22.634]  With a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like $40, $50 for a little bottle.
[02:18:24.329 --> 02:18:24.790]  Think about that.
[02:18:25.390 --> 02:18:26.752]  It's $74 right now.
[02:18:27.673 --> 02:18:32.638]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[02:18:33.659 --> 02:18:34.960]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:43.349]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:45.391]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[02:18:46.412 --> 02:18:53.413]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product So I'm not gambled.
[02:18:53.993 --> 02:18:54.874]  I know you want value.
[02:18:54.914 --> 02:19:11.897]  So we bought even more of it We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it and we've got it right now At the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere DNA force go read the five-star reviews thousands of go see what people set it in for them.
[02:19:12.337 --> 02:19:13.377]  It is dramatic and
[02:19:14.514 --> 02:19:22.279]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:31.525]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[02:19:32.045 --> 02:19:38.630]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[02:19:41.494 --> 02:19:47.116]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[02:19:47.316 --> 02:19:47.777]  That's fine.
[02:19:49.217 --> 02:19:50.278]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[02:19:50.698 --> 02:19:51.398]  I'm funded by you.
[02:19:51.598 --> 02:19:52.498]  So thank you all.
[02:19:53.159 --> 02:19:58.161]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[02:19:58.701 --> 02:20:01.362]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[02:20:05.103 --> 02:20:07.724]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.398 --> 02:20:27.292]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:51.624 --> 02:20:54.085]  Well, there's a good chance there's going to be a violent civil war in this country.
[02:20:55.605 --> 02:21:01.626]  And crushing the minions of the globalists is the least of our problems.
[02:21:05.307 --> 02:21:19.970]  It's really sad that they have raised in the bosom of freedom and liberty in this country a bunch of authoritarians who believe that they are the instruments of cultural
[02:21:22.048 --> 02:21:22.428]  Fairness.
[02:21:24.809 --> 02:21:29.191]  When they are the most dishonest, lying, stupid people the world's ever seen.
[02:21:31.372 --> 02:21:33.693]  Oh yeah, the left wants to abort every baby they can.
[02:21:35.374 --> 02:21:36.094]  Hate families.
[02:21:36.675 --> 02:21:37.295]  Hate God.
[02:21:37.375 --> 02:21:38.055]  Hate Christians.
[02:21:38.475 --> 02:21:40.096]  Tell you they want to get rid of the nuclear family.
[02:21:40.156 --> 02:21:41.437]  Tell you nobody wants these kids.
[02:21:44.078 --> 02:21:48.920]  When it comes to deporting people who they've invited to come, so it's 300% higher than when Obama was in,
[02:21:51.584 --> 02:21:54.005]  Because the UN has literally staged this operation.
[02:21:55.765 --> 02:21:58.006]  And now we're going to have to have military bases keeping these people.
[02:21:58.466 --> 02:22:03.728]  Because if you actually totally open the borders, you'll have 300 million people, you'll have 300 million come in.
[02:22:04.689 --> 02:22:05.049]  Literally.
[02:22:06.149 --> 02:22:11.771]  That's why Macron, this is the globalist invasion plan, said we want 200 million the next 10 years into Europe.
[02:22:14.193 --> 02:22:15.854]  10 million in the last five has wrecked it.
[02:22:16.354 --> 02:22:18.755]  Tourism's down 80-something percent, you name it.
[02:22:19.155 --> 02:22:24.797]  They don't care because it's part of a military conquering operation.
[02:22:24.817 --> 02:22:27.658]  And when I say that, I'm not just saying it.
[02:22:27.978 --> 02:22:28.859]  They admit it.
[02:22:28.999 --> 02:22:29.959]  Do you understand?
[02:22:29.979 --> 02:22:33.661]  This is the real deal.
[02:22:38.423 --> 02:22:39.783]  And it's just crazy.
[02:22:40.503 --> 02:22:41.904]  The third world is collapsing.
[02:22:43.766 --> 02:22:46.268]  The population of the third world is massively ballooning.
[02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:50.352]  Africa's population is set to double in the next 20 years.
[02:22:56.058 --> 02:23:00.662]  And then the left has set it up where it'll just collapse the infrastructure of the West and not even help the people that come in.
[02:23:02.631 --> 02:23:13.216]  It is an anti-human plan to collapse civilization, and then the globalists are going to come in with a global police state and mop it up with bioweapons, you name it, in their own admissions.
[02:23:14.076 --> 02:23:16.177]  That's what's so diabolical about all this.
[02:23:16.197 --> 02:23:25.642]  And they'll have the remnants of the Western world all kind of quietly knowing what's going on, while billions die and saying, well,
[02:23:29.468 --> 02:23:35.009]  Thank God the Earth had reached its carrying capacity, so I guess Mother Nature took action.
[02:23:35.089 --> 02:23:36.570]  No, that's not what's about to happen.
[02:23:43.632 --> 02:23:52.934]  And that's why it's frustrating to see just how wicked and just how evil the globalist minions are themselves.
[02:23:54.292 --> 02:23:57.034]  So, we can sit here and eat around the edges of this all day.
[02:23:57.094 --> 02:24:02.017]  We can talk about, hey, they lied, that little kid, the poster girl, was with her mom.
[02:24:02.077 --> 02:24:03.658]  Hey, 83% of the people are unaccompanied.
[02:24:04.919 --> 02:24:12.985]  But for those that really are with parents, and they got IDs, we can prove it, or the kid looks like them, and we put them in a family center.
[02:24:15.666 --> 02:24:22.451]  But when you got some 18-year-old guy going, that's my mommy, that's my daddy, let me in, I'm an asylum seeker, I'm a child.
[02:24:23.011 --> 02:24:23.812]  They go, no, you're not.
[02:24:24.755 --> 02:24:25.475]  We're deporting you.
[02:24:25.695 --> 02:24:29.077]  The media goes, oh, you've got a child in a detention center.
[02:24:29.357 --> 02:24:42.023]  Just like in Europe, you'll read the Sweden or Germany, where they've got 25-year-old men with beards who fought for Al-Qaeda and ISIS going to middle schools, not even high schools.
[02:24:42.483 --> 02:24:48.086]  And then on German TV, it shows the 25-year-old guy, in that case 24, with his 14-year-old bride.
[02:24:51.716 --> 02:25:00.818]  In after-school TV, telling the young German girls, get your... ...adult man.
[02:25:00.838 --> 02:25:05.660]  I mean, I've played the newscast here.
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:07.220]  I've shown you this.
[02:25:08.901 --> 02:25:14.322]  I've got newscasts of them taking microchips for bus fare and train fare.
[02:25:16.483 --> 02:25:17.603]  You take the chip, it's free.
[02:25:18.615 --> 02:25:20.236]  God, I heard of that before in a thing called the Bible.
[02:25:20.836 --> 02:25:23.418]  You take your chip, and you get discounts where it's free.
[02:25:24.018 --> 02:25:26.099]  There's a pretty Swedish girl telling you.
[02:25:26.479 --> 02:25:27.680]  And another pretty Swedish girl.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.082]  It's just pretty Swedish blonde that were pretty Swedish blonde.
[02:25:31.602 --> 02:25:33.843]  And it's so high-tech, and you come right into their center.
[02:25:34.424 --> 02:25:35.664]  You just get it right in your hand.
[02:25:36.024 --> 02:25:37.325]  Oh, it's so much fun!
[02:25:37.926 --> 02:25:40.727]  Is there nothing the Swedes won't put up with?
[02:25:41.027 --> 02:25:43.048]  That's why Stockholm Syndrome comes from that.
[02:25:43.228 --> 02:25:43.789]  That's what I mean.
[02:25:44.858 --> 02:25:45.258]  We're here.
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:50.083]  You have all these dirty, corrupt, high-level CIA people.
[02:25:51.485 --> 02:25:57.811]  And I'm not defending the FBI, but almost all the guys at the FBI that are actually deep state are really CIA.
[02:25:58.392 --> 02:25:59.833]  Phil Mudd and all these guys.
[02:26:01.675 --> 02:26:03.097]  Because they're an intelligence operation.
[02:26:03.117 --> 02:26:04.578]  They're taking over the FBI.
[02:26:05.819 --> 02:26:06.300]  Under Clinton.
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:06.981]  That's when it started.
[02:26:08.186 --> 02:26:16.128]  And they're saying, we're gonna overthrow the president, get ready, it's all gonna happen, he's a traitor, he's a Nazi, his constituents are Nazis, attack him in the streets.
[02:26:17.008 --> 02:26:26.471]  They're actually trying to get everyone ready for a real civil war, and right on time, the Washington Post, USA Today, the New York Times says, we're in a civil war.
[02:26:27.551 --> 02:26:31.012]  And so they're beta testing to see if they can get away with it.
[02:26:33.313 --> 02:26:36.354]  And the president must brand it for what it is.
[02:26:38.015 --> 02:26:52.067]  Powerful global banks, the Chai Koms and others with media, targeting their constituents that are mainly academics and people that think they're part of the ruling class and then people on welfare under them, their dependent class, that they milk.
[02:26:54.348 --> 02:27:03.176]  And they are confirmed in their plans to start physical attacks.
[02:27:05.191 --> 02:27:10.846]  And everything they do is by deception, so you know false flags are going to follow.
[02:27:12.912 --> 02:27:36.128]  Where they will attack their own installations to blame it on us and it is about to get hysterical and it's about to be their main push because they have been trying to get Trump out for a year and a half and now with all the peace deals and all the economy coming back and everything turning around they are panicking and they now know they've got to accelerate their timetable because what they thought to get rid of Trump hasn't materialized yet.
[02:27:37.809 --> 02:27:38.730]  And so now Bill Maher
[02:27:39.932 --> 02:27:42.154]  Said a few weeks ago he wants a depression to kick Trump out.
[02:27:42.414 --> 02:27:43.935]  He wants an economic collapse is the quote.
[02:27:44.436 --> 02:27:50.041]  Now he just said F you Alex Jones and I hope you die Mike Cernovich and then everybody laughs.
[02:27:50.521 --> 02:27:51.382]  You're like where's the joke?
[02:27:52.803 --> 02:28:00.509]  No he just says how dare you Mike Cernovich say that people commit more suicide during economic collapses.
[02:28:00.749 --> 02:28:02.311]  Well I just hope you commit suicide.
[02:28:04.445 --> 02:28:09.889]  Then I went on to say Bill Maher's worth $100 million according to his own press releases crashed the US economy to stop Trump.
[02:28:10.329 --> 02:28:11.190]  That's a quote, by the way.
[02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:13.891]  And he said, Jones, you're a liar.
[02:28:14.192 --> 02:28:14.832]  That's not true.
[02:28:15.893 --> 02:28:22.617]  I have the clip, but he has such disdain that he thinks his audience two weeks ago doesn't remember what he did.
[02:28:22.677 --> 02:28:23.558]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[02:28:23.618 --> 02:28:24.919]  It's like it's all lies.
[02:28:28.263 --> 02:28:31.786]  It's all total, complete, conscious lies.
[02:28:32.026 --> 02:28:36.089]  I want to get your take on how we counter this and what we do, because I know we're going to win.
[02:28:36.109 --> 02:28:39.192]  I just don't want it to be really, really messy, but I mean, how do we deal with this?
[02:28:39.812 --> 02:28:41.834]  Where do you think they're going next?
[02:28:41.854 --> 02:28:44.836]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[02:28:44.977 --> 02:28:53.864]  I mean, my mind is really pregnant in thought about the next big battle plan, which I'm going to be announcing soon.
[02:28:54.324 --> 02:28:57.547]  But I just, I'm in a moment of peak frustration right now.
[02:29:00.999 --> 02:29:04.341]  I have a special message for you from the President of the United States.
[02:29:07.123 --> 02:29:17.229]  The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC.
[02:29:32.347 --> 02:29:39.415]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[02:29:47.728 --> 02:29:52.350]  The USS Liberty was attacked by three Mirage III fighter bombers.
[02:29:52.390 --> 02:29:55.631]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former U.S.
[02:29:55.671 --> 02:29:57.572]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[02:29:57.972 --> 02:30:01.374]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[02:30:01.674 --> 02:30:03.895]  They've now said that there were 11 hostages.
[02:30:04.475 --> 02:30:08.797]  Two were killed in their rooms this morning, yesterday morning.
[02:30:09.807 --> 02:30:13.588]  Nine were killed at the airport tonight.
[02:30:14.029 --> 02:30:14.529]  They're all gone.
[02:30:15.289 --> 02:30:21.531]  A bomb exploded early this morning in the Pentagon, and left-wing terrorists telephoned newspapers to say they were responsible.
[02:30:21.571 --> 02:30:29.054]  People calling themselves members of the Weather Underground last night spotted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California.
[02:30:29.134 --> 02:30:32.656]  Here he goes, and he will go.
[02:30:32.716 --> 02:30:35.937]  He's down and he is hurt.
[02:30:37.411 --> 02:30:38.879]  What a jump!
[02:30:38.899 --> 02:30:40.348]  Evil's riding the amazing stunt cycle.
[02:30:42.236 --> 02:30:46.540]  Evel Knievel sold separately or with the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle from Ideal.
[02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:48.922]  Are you sure it's the measles?
[02:30:49.062 --> 02:30:50.883]  Well, he's certainly got all the symptoms.
[02:30:51.224 --> 02:30:53.906]  A slight temperature, a lot of dots, and a great big smile.
[02:30:54.086 --> 02:30:55.167]  A great big smile.
[02:30:55.507 --> 02:30:56.608]  No school for a few days.
[02:30:56.828 --> 02:30:58.570]  Boy, this is the life, isn't it?
[02:30:58.610 --> 02:30:59.070]  Yeah.
[02:30:59.130 --> 02:31:01.972]  If you have to get sick, you can't beat the measles.
[02:31:02.012 --> 02:31:02.613]  That's right.
[02:31:02.833 --> 02:31:03.814]  Swine flu?
[02:31:04.014 --> 02:31:05.776]  Man, I'm too fast to let it catch me.
[02:31:06.316 --> 02:31:07.437]  You'll want to be protected.
[02:31:08.097 --> 02:31:09.238]  Get a shot of protection.
[02:31:09.799 --> 02:31:10.760]  The Swine Flu Shot.
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:15.783]  The vaccines are safe, easy to take, and they can protect you against flu.
[02:31:15.883 --> 02:31:22.628]  Washington decided that every man, woman, and child in the nation should get a shot to prevent a nationwide outbreak, a pandemic.
[02:31:22.708 --> 02:31:32.815]  This virus was the cause of a pandemic in 1918 and 1919 that resulted in over half a million deaths in the United States.
[02:31:33.055 --> 02:31:34.957]  46 million of us obediently took the shot.
[02:31:35.837 --> 02:31:44.304]  And now 4,000 Americans are claiming damages from Uncle Sam amounting to three and a half billion dollars because of what happened when they took that shot.
[02:31:44.765 --> 02:31:50.149]  By far the greatest number of the claims, two-thirds of them, are for neurological damage or even death.
[02:31:50.329 --> 02:31:58.096]  If you are resuming this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[02:32:01.226 --> 02:32:04.548]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[02:32:04.888 --> 02:32:12.372]  Between debt crises, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.

[02:33:05.165 --> 02:33:07.786]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:30.912 --> 02:33:44.118]  In 1946, the Rockefeller family donated the money to found the United Nations in Presidio military base, naval base in San Francisco.
[02:33:45.799 --> 02:33:54.643]  It was then officially moved a few years later when they built the UN Center there in New York City, there in Manhattan.
[02:33:56.041 --> 02:33:56.281]  I think?
[02:34:16.892 --> 02:34:27.077]  That they would have policies to balloon their populations at first as a political weapon to then come in and take over the first world in all competition to vertical integration.
[02:34:27.797 --> 02:34:43.265]  Use the global crisis that came out of that as the pretext to then bring in a world fascist order and forced depopulation, planetary one-child population, and a planetary microchip population based on the IBM
[02:34:44.125 --> 02:34:48.408]  Hollerith machine system but with a chip instead of a tattoo.
[02:34:51.831 --> 02:34:51.971]  Yeah.
[02:34:52.611 --> 02:34:57.155]  By the 60s they wrote books admitting the plan that we've reviewed and covered here.
[02:34:58.536 --> 02:34:59.256]  And now we're here.
[02:35:00.497 --> 02:35:02.319]  And nation states are trying to say no.
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:06.722]  And so the controlled corporate media
[02:35:08.208 --> 02:35:15.294]  And Hollywood is doing nothing but race war and division and America hating every Netflix, every movie, every show.
[02:35:15.374 --> 02:35:24.843]  It's just, it's just, and it's killing Hollywood and it's killing the NFL and it's killing TV ratings because you can't watch anything without a bunch of unwholesome, hateful messages.
[02:35:24.863 --> 02:35:26.364]  You're like, why would they hurt themselves?
[02:35:26.664 --> 02:35:29.447]  Why would the NFL lose 45% of its viewers the last two years?
[02:35:31.508 --> 02:35:34.051]  Because they were all just entertainment owned by the big banks.
[02:35:35.486 --> 02:35:36.507]  Who have unlimited money.
[02:35:37.147 --> 02:35:39.790]  They don't care if it hurts their ratings, as long as they get full control.
[02:35:41.551 --> 02:35:43.813]  So now, globally, they're making their move to censor the web.
[02:35:44.174 --> 02:35:47.717]  They're making their move to massively finance anti-populist candidates.
[02:35:47.937 --> 02:35:51.200]  They're making their move to cause cultural division, civil war.
[02:35:51.700 --> 02:36:01.028]  And now, we've gone, vindicated again, from Infowars being the only place saying Democrats are going to plan a civil war to overturn Trump and civil emergency.
[02:36:01.048 --> 02:36:02.590]  I've been saying that since he was president-elect.
[02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:07.491]  Now it's in the New York Times, USA Today, it's everywhere today.
[02:36:09.032 --> 02:36:14.753]  With Maxine Waters saying, go to their houses, go to their car, go to the gas stations, go to the restaurants, throw them out!
[02:36:22.396 --> 02:36:27.057]  And these bullies, you know, it starts with throwing Milo out of a restaurant, or calling him a Nazi.
[02:36:28.337 --> 02:36:30.138]  Calling me a Nazi, throwing coffee on me.
[02:36:31.752 --> 02:36:33.873]  Credit card companies saying, oh, we're not going to work with you.
[02:36:33.893 --> 02:36:35.093]  We're not going to work with gun companies.
[02:36:35.393 --> 02:36:40.595]  Remington going bankrupt, being sued by the very same people, same law firm suing me in Connecticut.
[02:36:41.295 --> 02:36:43.456]  I mean, these people mean business.
[02:36:44.616 --> 02:36:48.737]  And so we have to understand, capitulating to them doesn't get us out of this.
[02:36:49.458 --> 02:36:57.260]  They're accelerating their timetable of total control because they know we're beginning to win.
[02:36:59.989 --> 02:37:04.133]  So if you give in to them and if you're bullied by them, they will succeed.
[02:37:05.634 --> 02:37:10.139]  But if you stand up and say no and let them know you're never backing down, you're never giving in, you will succeed.
[02:37:10.559 --> 02:37:22.330]  But you've got to now search engine any restaurant you eat at, any hotel you stay at, and find out if they're even any level connected with the establishment or the left.
[02:37:22.931 --> 02:37:23.852]  You cannot support them.
[02:37:24.696 --> 02:37:26.737]  You can't send your children to establishment colleges.
[02:37:26.777 --> 02:37:30.059]  You can't buy food at the establishment grocery store.
[02:37:30.219 --> 02:37:31.840]  You can't buy a car from somebody.
[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:36.123]  Because, you know, as libertarians, as patriots, where we just come in and are nice and, you know, whatever.
[02:37:36.303 --> 02:37:37.123]  Okay, you're a left.
[02:37:37.203 --> 02:37:37.424]  No.
[02:37:38.044 --> 02:37:40.766]  We have to cut them off.
[02:37:41.706 --> 02:37:43.267]  Their blue states are already collapsing.
[02:37:43.567 --> 02:37:44.728]  They're collapsing worldwide.
[02:37:44.808 --> 02:37:48.230]  They need to bully us, they realize, because we're their food.
[02:37:51.909 --> 02:37:56.632]  Quite literally, if there was a societal collapse, the left would try to organize us into pens and eat us.
[02:37:59.234 --> 02:38:02.056]  They're pro-abortion, anti-human dogs.
[02:38:02.796 --> 02:38:04.117]  And that's mean to dogs, excuse me.
[02:38:06.078 --> 02:38:08.520]  And you've got to understand, they're the bad guys.
[02:38:10.701 --> 02:38:11.542]  And they mean business.
[02:38:13.543 --> 02:38:16.865]  Everything they touch, every city, every state turns to hell.
[02:38:17.265 --> 02:38:18.486]  Every country turns to hell.
[02:38:18.566 --> 02:38:19.307]  And they know it.
[02:38:19.527 --> 02:38:20.868]  They've all got Swiss bank accounts.
[02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:23.681]  They're not, they know what they're part of.
[02:38:24.261 --> 02:38:27.403]  Why would Jerry Brown legalize giving blood if you have HIV?
[02:38:30.244 --> 02:38:38.349]  Why would they try to block people who are terminally ill from getting experimental medicine but they want you to pay for assisted suicide with people that aren't even sick?
[02:38:39.329 --> 02:38:40.630]  Because they're sick in the head.
[02:38:42.073 --> 02:38:44.013]  Think like the devil, and then you'll think like them.
[02:38:44.273 --> 02:38:56.355]  Think about how you could hurt people the most, and make them poor, and try to kill them, but first suck their soul, and then you'll get Brown, and Clinton, and all these people.
[02:38:56.475 --> 02:39:03.497]  They are evil, and I only the last few years realized that I thought the very top was super evil.
[02:39:03.577 --> 02:39:11.598]  No, they've now got it down to the lower level people, have been given over to great delusion, they're like zombies now, and they'll do anything.
[02:39:14.574 --> 02:39:16.756]  Because they have nothing inside them.
[02:39:17.216 --> 02:39:28.845]  And so they just want to grasp and get more and more, and they want to run this, they want to run that, and they see how Christians and conservatives and patriots have the light of God in our hearts, and they can't stand it.
[02:39:29.205 --> 02:39:29.986]  It's metaphysical.
[02:39:30.046 --> 02:39:32.528]  Why in the allegory of the zombie does it always want what?
[02:39:32.648 --> 02:39:33.168]  Brains.
[02:39:33.629 --> 02:39:34.990]  Because it doesn't have brains.
[02:39:37.392 --> 02:39:41.555]  And no matter how many brains it eats, it's still spiritually dead.
[02:39:46.300 --> 02:39:52.662]  And when you look at people, and they look so empty now, and then you see somebody that looks awake or alive, like, wow, that's a person.
[02:39:52.902 --> 02:39:55.723]  You see other people, they're like, just kind of, because they're in a haze.
[02:39:55.803 --> 02:39:56.844]  They're almost dead now.
[02:39:57.404 --> 02:39:58.705]  A lot of them, their souls are already gone.
[02:40:03.226 --> 02:40:08.368]  And they just want to hurt you, as many babies as they can.
[02:40:08.388 --> 02:40:09.388]  Doesn't matter.
[02:40:09.408 --> 02:40:10.869]  And they're not going to stop.
[02:40:12.873 --> 02:40:20.720]  And so that's really the fight we've got up in front of us is the realization that the left didn't want to really get rid of poverty.
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:22.362]  They didn't really want to get rid of racism.
[02:40:22.402 --> 02:40:23.943]  They didn't really want to go to the stars.
[02:40:24.023 --> 02:40:24.323]  No, no.
[02:40:25.625 --> 02:40:27.486]  Like Bill Maher says, I want more abortion.
[02:40:27.566 --> 02:40:28.567]  I want more suicide.
[02:40:30.269 --> 02:40:31.870]  I want Mike Cernovich to kill himself.
[02:40:32.911 --> 02:40:34.853]  They made a joke later and it never even made any sense.
[02:40:35.173 --> 02:40:37.095]  He goes, I'm going to put you in an oven, Mike Cernovich.
[02:40:41.877 --> 02:40:45.738]  And it's like, you could do a whole college course just on that eight minute rant that he read off a teleprompter.
[02:40:46.019 --> 02:40:48.660]  Because he shows, he goes, and I don't even know who you are, Mike Cernovich.
[02:40:52.021 --> 02:40:52.221]  See?
[02:40:54.542 --> 02:40:56.202]  Because somebody else wrote that for you, didn't they?
[02:40:56.763 --> 02:40:59.384]  They want to put the enemies up there and say, don't listen to what he says.
[02:40:59.764 --> 02:41:02.465]  It's a fact you said you want an economic collapse.
[02:41:02.845 --> 02:41:05.146]  It's a fact that suicide's double under those.
[02:41:06.887 --> 02:41:10.608]  And it's a fact that you love suicide and you love death, but you love little children so much.
[02:41:13.186 --> 02:41:16.769]  And you hope we kill ourselves in the same breath.
[02:41:21.554 --> 02:41:28.500]  And then you turn around, though, and say, I'm fake news when I was quoting what you said two weeks before.
[02:41:29.701 --> 02:41:33.805]  Yeah, yeah, let's back that up on the part with me, because it's incredible.
[02:41:34.065 --> 02:41:36.967]  You could teach a college course on the inversion of reality, on purpose!
[02:41:39.079 --> 02:41:46.567]  He explains why he wants to crash the economy to stop Trump, then he shows me saying Bill Maher wants to crash it and he says I'm wrong.
[02:41:47.147 --> 02:41:48.849]  When he says that, I'm wrong about his $100 million.
[02:41:51.351 --> 02:41:55.415]  But the same piece he brags that he makes $10 million a year and then he gave $1 million to Obama.
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:03.241]  You've been doing the HBO show for almost 10 years.
[02:42:03.261 --> 02:42:04.382]  You get $10 million a year on that.
[02:42:04.442 --> 02:42:06.263]  You'll probably make $5 million a year on your comedy.
[02:42:06.903 --> 02:42:07.664]  You had all the other TV shows.
[02:42:07.704 --> 02:42:11.486]  Okay, whatever you make, you've made $100 million just with your HBO deal.
[02:42:12.106 --> 02:42:14.348]  The point is, you're saying I'm a fraud when you're the fraud.
[02:42:14.368 --> 02:42:14.748]  Here he is.
[02:42:16.189 --> 02:42:21.432]  Alex Jones tweeted, Bill Maher is worth $100 million, but he says we should crash the U.S.
[02:42:21.492 --> 02:42:22.693]  economy to stop Trump.
[02:42:23.113 --> 02:42:24.854]  And when has he ever strayed from the facts?
[02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:30.952]  And then everyone on the right said I had a hundred million dollars.
[02:42:31.072 --> 02:42:33.894]  And all I have to say about that is, I do?
[02:42:37.017 --> 02:42:39.258]  You sure as hell made it on that contract.
[02:42:39.298 --> 02:42:41.640]  I'm out of here!
[02:42:42.581 --> 02:42:47.405]  No, I wouldn't leave you.
[02:42:51.536 --> 02:42:52.136]  It's all lies.
[02:42:52.156 --> 02:42:53.937]  Sarah Palin tweeted to her follower.
[02:42:54.217 --> 02:42:57.199]  And then he comes back to Cernovich and says, I hope you do kill yourself.
[02:42:57.819 --> 02:42:58.579]  He goes, but no, no, don't.
[02:42:58.599 --> 02:42:59.279]  Get some help.
[02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:04.422]  Western Europe has already banned free speech.
[02:43:04.602 --> 02:43:08.764]  And an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:43:09.164 --> 02:43:16.647]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:43:17.087 --> 02:43:20.169]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:43:20.789 --> 02:43:25.272]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:43:25.432 --> 02:43:29.355]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:43:29.575 --> 02:43:32.297]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:43:32.717 --> 02:43:37.020]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:40.522]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:43:40.942 --> 02:43:55.781]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:43:56.041 --> 02:43:57.323]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:43:57.563 --> 02:43:59.906]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:44:01.348 --> 02:44:06.612]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:44:07.333 --> 02:44:10.636]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:44:11.496 --> 02:44:17.742]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:44:19.523 --> 02:44:25.868]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:44:26.669 --> 02:44:31.933]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:44:32.534 --> 02:44:41.261]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[02:44:41.741 --> 02:44:41.901]  Now!
[02:44:41.921 --> 02:44:42.942]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:45:06.423 --> 02:45:08.484]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:45:08.764 --> 02:45:09.824]  I believe in you!
[02:45:09.844 --> 02:45:11.384]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:45:13.125 --> 02:45:17.946]  One man, emirates a woman, all genitals were cut off!
[02:45:18.226 --> 02:45:20.667]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:45:20.807 --> 02:45:22.007]  And we're not backing down on her!
[02:45:23.928 --> 02:45:25.048]  I want to kick these people!
[02:45:25.108 --> 02:45:25.628]  We're winning!
[02:45:25.688 --> 02:45:26.789]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:45:26.949 --> 02:45:27.409]  Can't you?
[02:45:27.689 --> 02:45:29.329]  We have broken their back!
[02:45:29.689 --> 02:45:30.850]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:45:34.691 --> 02:45:35.231]  Let's go!
[02:45:36.578 --> 02:45:36.778]  Come on!
[02:45:36.798 --> 02:45:37.058]  Come on!

[02:45:51.332 --> 02:45:51.552]  Come on!
[02:45:51.592 --> 02:45:51.733]  Come on!
[02:45:51.753 --> 02:45:51.973]  Come on!

[02:45:53.815 --> 02:45:54.115]  Come on!
[02:45:54.195 --> 02:45:54.475]  Come on!
[02:45:54.515 --> 02:45:54.715]  Come on!

[02:45:56.998 --> 02:45:57.158]  Come on!
[02:45:57.178 --> 02:45:57.318]  Come on
[02:46:01.727 --> 02:46:06.292]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:46:06.312 --> 02:46:06.833]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:06.893 --> 02:46:07.814]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:46:08.314 --> 02:46:11.878]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:46:11.938 --> 02:46:20.688]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:46:20.808 --> 02:46:36.979]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing!
[02:46:37.459 --> 02:46:45.989]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:46:46.069 --> 02:46:50.835]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:46:50.955 --> 02:46:56.221]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:47:05.134 --> 02:47:09.318]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.483 --> 02:47:21.291]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this town.
[02:47:30.734 --> 02:47:32.477]  Alright, I'm going to take a bunch of your phone calls right now.
[02:47:32.497 --> 02:47:40.432]  I had a Gerald Cilente coming on and I'm just cogitating, I'm formulating what I think should be the responses to all of this in the next few days.
[02:47:41.505 --> 02:47:46.449]  But I think we should all be loud and proud about freedom and talk about the positive things that are happening.
[02:47:46.869 --> 02:47:52.233]  Point out that former corrupt individuals at the CIA and FBI and NSA are trying to throw Trump out.
[02:47:52.353 --> 02:47:53.294]  Show where they're saying that.
[02:47:54.214 --> 02:47:55.095]  Support the president.
[02:47:55.155 --> 02:47:56.396]  Be bold about what's happening.
[02:47:57.076 --> 02:47:59.458]  Withdraw our support from these anti-American universities.
[02:48:00.479 --> 02:48:03.761]  And challenge leftist groups to advertise that they don't want us in their businesses.
[02:48:03.821 --> 02:48:05.463]  God, I don't want to go in your businesses.
[02:48:05.883 --> 02:48:09.586]  In fact, I want you to stay in your blue states and, you know, just keep sucking off each other.
[02:48:10.626 --> 02:48:11.887]  But we know that's not the case.
[02:48:12.967 --> 02:48:15.428]  So, history is happening all around us.
[02:48:16.509 --> 02:48:26.013]  And these calls for civil war, and the fact that even mainstream media now gets that it's civil war, shows us that we're entering a very, very dangerous phase right now.
[02:48:26.053 --> 02:48:28.594]  They plan to launch something big in the summer months.
[02:48:29.634 --> 02:48:30.315]  Summer's here.
[02:48:31.815 --> 02:48:35.277]  And the left always makes its move in the summer.
[02:48:36.832 --> 02:48:42.834]  And so they are planning civil unrest, all these ugly old stupid mummies in Hollywood and the rest of it.
[02:48:43.134 --> 02:48:44.234]  We're smarter than them.
[02:48:45.314 --> 02:48:46.715]  We can defeat them together.
[02:48:46.755 --> 02:48:47.575]  We're coming together.
[02:48:48.215 --> 02:48:49.756]  But I think it's more important than ever.
[02:48:49.776 --> 02:48:51.976]  I mean, I'm going to go put on some Trump gear this week.
[02:48:52.496 --> 02:48:57.678]  I'm going to go march around all over the place downtown and just let them get in my face and just show who they are.
[02:48:57.718 --> 02:49:01.879]  Because that's the number one thing is to not let them intimidate us.
[02:49:03.408 --> 02:49:10.695]  And to just point out the great successes we've had and what's going on and the fact that Trump has delivered on what he said he would do and he's standing up to him.
[02:49:11.455 --> 02:49:14.058]  And it's just quite a period in history to be part of right now.
[02:49:15.299 --> 02:49:21.044]  All right, we got Eugene and Mark and Naveed and Jeff and Carter and Brad and everybody.
[02:49:22.225 --> 02:49:23.726]  Who's up next?
[02:49:27.049 --> 02:49:28.511]  Let's go ahead and go to Jerome in New York.
[02:49:28.531 --> 02:49:29.692]  Jerome, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:49:32.742 --> 02:49:33.363]  Good afternoon.
[02:49:33.383 --> 02:49:36.405]  I've got a question for you before I give my comment on the Civil War.
[02:49:38.467 --> 02:49:44.712]  Who gives the order, and you know the answer to this, and I know Roger Stone does too, Matt Bracken.
[02:49:44.752 --> 02:49:46.053]  Y'all all know the answer to this.
[02:49:46.273 --> 02:49:49.096]  Who gives the order to sting him and let her go?
[02:49:51.437 --> 02:49:52.038]  Sting who?
[02:49:53.439 --> 02:49:54.220]  Sting Trump.
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:55.701]  Let Clinton go.
[02:49:55.721 --> 02:49:56.822]  Who gives that order?
[02:49:59.361 --> 02:50:05.464]  I would say it was a committee meeting between the former head of the NSA, the former head of the CIA, Brennan, all those guys.
[02:50:05.844 --> 02:50:08.505]  Of course, he was still a candidate when that happened.
[02:50:08.586 --> 02:50:11.307]  It was Hillary and the Podestas and the big banks above it.
[02:50:11.747 --> 02:50:13.108]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[02:50:16.729 --> 02:50:19.771]  Yeah, you know dang well it goes back to that old office.
[02:50:20.327 --> 02:50:21.628]  Oh, you're talking about, oh yeah, oh no.
[02:50:21.889 --> 02:50:23.690]  Obama definitely put it on paper.
[02:50:23.850 --> 02:50:24.671]  You're 100% right.
[02:50:24.711 --> 02:50:26.013]  Yeah, but he's a minion too.
[02:50:26.053 --> 02:50:26.853]  That's what they're protecting.
[02:50:27.094 --> 02:50:27.995]  That's what they won't give Congress.
[02:50:28.075 --> 02:50:28.495]  Absolutely.
[02:50:28.795 --> 02:50:29.736]  It was ordered by the President.
[02:50:29.756 --> 02:50:31.258]  None of them would have done it if the President didn't order it.
[02:50:31.558 --> 02:50:34.401]  In fact, they admit that they had a whole office in the White House watching Trump.
[02:50:36.226 --> 02:50:39.588]  Those guys, the FBI and the DOJ, they're just, they're minions.
[02:50:39.688 --> 02:50:41.069]  They're menials.
[02:50:41.149 --> 02:50:42.730]  They don't, they didn't have nothing to do with it.
[02:50:42.770 --> 02:50:44.151]  They're just following orders.
[02:50:44.411 --> 02:50:45.732]  You're absolutely right.
[02:50:45.772 --> 02:50:46.553]  We've been hammering that.
[02:50:46.573 --> 02:50:46.853]  You're right.
[02:50:46.873 --> 02:50:51.116]  It's Barack Hussein Obama tried to hand the election to Hillary so that she'd cover up for his crimes.
[02:50:51.456 --> 02:50:52.937]  And that's why he's been keeping his head down.
[02:50:52.957 --> 02:50:55.538]  Why he haven't heard anything from him because he is behind it.
[02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:57.600]  Okay.
[02:50:57.640 --> 02:50:59.521]  Now let's get to the civil war.
[02:50:59.581 --> 02:51:00.682]  It's not going to be a civil war.
[02:51:00.722 --> 02:51:02.123]  It's going to be a revolution.
[02:51:02.163 --> 02:51:03.484]  They want to name it a civil war.
[02:51:03.504 --> 02:51:04.064]  It's just like that.
[02:51:04.918 --> 02:51:08.321]  That activity they have going on at the border, that's all showboat.
[02:51:08.481 --> 02:51:09.401]  That's all showboat.
[02:51:09.882 --> 02:51:11.743]  They keep wanting to push, push, push, push.
[02:51:11.763 --> 02:51:15.326]  They're going to keep pushing it until they get to the point where it's going to be a big shootout.
[02:51:15.526 --> 02:51:16.887]  That's all it's going to end up being.
[02:51:18.548 --> 02:51:20.470]  It's going to be a spontaneous type deal.
[02:51:21.851 --> 02:51:22.812]  It's not going to be pretty.
[02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:25.734]  I don't want to be involved in it, but hey, you know what?
[02:51:25.774 --> 02:51:26.955]  That's what it's going to end up being.
[02:51:28.012 --> 02:51:34.536]  Well, they're going to try to put out false images in the news and get us to fight with the police and people who will be given this info and be coming after us.
[02:51:35.057 --> 02:51:41.421]  If it gets into a shooting war, you've got to go around the police and at the heads of the globalist operation.
[02:51:45.263 --> 02:51:49.286]  Well, I don't want to be involved in it, but that's where it's going to end up.
[02:51:49.746 --> 02:51:54.229]  Oh, listen, I don't want a shooting war either, but they run around and start killing patriots and trying to grab us and stuff.
[02:51:55.149 --> 02:51:56.250]  There's only one thing we can do.
[02:51:56.370 --> 02:51:57.311]  Let's go towards the shooting.
[02:51:58.211 --> 02:52:04.473]  Those guys that framed the Constitution, our government, the way that they did it, our government actually is in flux.
[02:52:05.153 --> 02:52:06.253]  It's constantly moving.
[02:52:06.273 --> 02:52:11.755]  The only way it stays stable is by the rule of law, and those guys have done set it up.
[02:52:12.055 --> 02:52:15.736]  They have a whole different government set up over there in Washington than what you think it is.
[02:52:16.416 --> 02:52:19.017]  All of that bunch that was under Obama is still in there.
[02:52:19.747 --> 02:52:21.367]  Trump's wading through it as best he can.
[02:52:21.427 --> 02:52:22.007]  No, I know.
[02:52:22.408 --> 02:52:23.888]  They're called stay-behind networks.
[02:52:23.928 --> 02:52:25.128]  A thousand percent, you're right.
[02:52:25.188 --> 02:52:26.348]  That's what we're dealing with.
[02:52:26.628 --> 02:52:29.609]  And they're trying to make their move against the American voter right now.
[02:52:30.409 --> 02:52:36.550]  And they think they're going to start a shooting war in America and kill a bunch of us and that they're going to get away with it.
[02:52:36.590 --> 02:52:38.971]  They are, just like they thought Hillary was going to win.
[02:52:39.971 --> 02:52:45.192]  Well, we, well, the deal with the, that's why they were hell bent to get the guns, man.
[02:52:45.212 --> 02:52:46.592]  They know, they know.
[02:52:48.301 --> 02:52:50.143]  They know they have to have the way to stop us.
[02:52:50.163 --> 02:52:51.283]  The only way is through the guns.
[02:52:51.784 --> 02:52:52.304]  That's right.
[02:52:52.324 --> 02:52:53.685]  And there's 400 million guns, Jerome.
[02:52:53.725 --> 02:52:54.265]  Great points.
[02:52:54.946 --> 02:52:56.687]  And that's a fallback position.
[02:52:57.868 --> 02:52:59.369]  We're winning this informationally.
[02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:01.651]  And we've got to be cool about this.
[02:53:02.471 --> 02:53:03.432]  But at a certain point...
[02:53:06.246 --> 02:53:08.447]  I think economic warfare is the thing they've been doing to us.
[02:53:09.968 --> 02:53:12.549]  I get lazy sometimes, too, and don't look where I'm spending my money.
[02:53:13.089 --> 02:53:16.851]  And I just, you know, I even learned when the left is trying to build websites for you or do work for you, they never do it.
[02:53:16.871 --> 02:53:17.631]  They sabotage you.
[02:53:17.811 --> 02:53:19.492]  They act like a military.
[02:53:19.572 --> 02:53:19.932]  We don't.
[02:53:20.512 --> 02:53:22.173]  We act real nice and we're all friendly.
[02:53:22.954 --> 02:53:25.595]  Do not give globalists one dime, ever.
[02:53:26.695 --> 02:53:27.596]  They are your enemy.
[02:53:29.036 --> 02:53:35.019]  And if we don't have the discipline to not fund them and to not support them, then we don't deserve to be free.
[02:53:36.997 --> 02:53:38.097]  Thank you, Jerome, great points.
[02:53:40.739 --> 02:53:42.679]  Naveed in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:53:42.699 --> 02:53:46.801]  Hello?
[02:53:47.161 --> 02:53:47.801]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:53:48.822 --> 02:54:05.989]  Hi, yeah, you asked a question about how can we stifle these pathological liars who are leading the liberal movement, and the best way we can do that, I believe, is to be relentless with the truth that we tell, and it's to hit them where it hurts with the truth, and to be relentless in that direction.
[02:54:06.525 --> 02:54:12.370]  And in my opinion, the family jewels, so to speak, of the liberal movement is the LGBT community.
[02:54:13.011 --> 02:54:17.455]  And they're the ones who tell the most lies, and they're the easiest to refute.
[02:54:17.875 --> 02:54:30.466]  Because their entire movement has started with this idea that they're born this way, and this is categorically proven wrong by the existence of ex-gays and ex-transsexuals.
[02:54:31.357 --> 02:54:36.178]  And not only them, but the entire transsexual movement is such a farce.
[02:54:36.738 --> 02:54:39.979]  Over 90% of transsexuals are male to fake female.
[02:54:41.199 --> 02:54:47.140]  Over 60% are child molestation victims.
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:48.781]  Over 45% kill themselves.
[02:54:49.821 --> 02:54:52.401]  And they want us to believe that this is a condition people are born into.
[02:54:53.381 --> 02:54:54.582]  This is a sex addict
[02:54:56.587 --> 02:54:57.729]  Death cult, basically.
[02:54:58.009 --> 02:55:05.842]  And the most important thing here to understand about this is that these sex addicts, what are they doing?
[02:55:05.882 --> 02:55:10.188]  They're trying to go after our children, to brainwash our children into school.
[02:55:11.307 --> 02:55:20.014]  Well, there's no doubt the way that the pedophile movement, NAMBLA, is getting at is sex education and diversity training, where they try to confuse six and seven year olds about what sex they are.
[02:55:20.134 --> 02:55:24.417]  It is total depopulation, Taberstock Institute, that is all admitted.
[02:55:24.918 --> 02:55:28.420]  And notice how much they attack me on what chemicals in the water do.
[02:55:29.574 --> 02:55:32.975]  In the proclivity of brain development, sterilization, things like that.
[02:55:33.015 --> 02:55:34.256]  That is a fact.
[02:55:34.996 --> 02:55:36.717]  And it is a fact it's going on.
[02:55:37.497 --> 02:55:41.319]  And notice, when you see the talking points on Stephen Colbert, it's always about that.
[02:55:41.919 --> 02:55:45.420]  Because they don't want people going, oh wait, they figured out Ms.
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:48.361]  Finale is feminizing boys.
[02:55:48.762 --> 02:55:50.442]  Well, what if they figure out all the rest of it?
[02:55:50.502 --> 02:55:52.183]  And again, it's part of a larger plan.
[02:55:53.709 --> 02:56:07.140]  Yeah, I mean, the chemicals and all that thing aside, that's all true, that's all 100% true, but it can all be stopped by logic and by just telling the truth about the movement and how it's based on lies.
[02:56:07.180 --> 02:56:12.105]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt that governments and groups have taken grips like that and weaponized it.
[02:56:12.645 --> 02:56:12.785]  That's
[02:56:30.336 --> 02:56:39.861]  You know, all those types of people are on the same page, but in the main, about how it's very destructive, how it's pointed at the family as a weapon, you're absolutely right.
[02:56:39.881 --> 02:56:40.642]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:40.662 --> 02:56:45.064]  I'm going to come back, take a few more calls, and then we've got Gerald Celente coming up.
[02:56:46.105 --> 02:56:57.711]  I wanted to get up here with some big master message today, and I think I covered a lot, but I wanted to really, you know, roll a strike in bowling every shot today, because
[02:56:59.249 --> 02:57:00.527]  History is here right now.
[02:57:02.210 --> 02:57:06.813]  And to the point, I didn't even plug once today, because my brain is just 100% in the clouds, kind of.
[02:57:07.533 --> 02:57:09.555]  Because you can see where the left's going.
[02:57:09.635 --> 02:57:11.156]  I know they're going to get really violent.
[02:57:11.636 --> 02:57:13.037]  I know they're not going to stop now.
[02:57:13.217 --> 02:57:15.558]  And it just, so I knew this was coming.
[02:57:15.598 --> 02:57:18.020]  Now I've got to ask, how is it going to play out?
[02:57:18.100 --> 02:57:19.161]  What are they going to pull next?
[02:57:19.621 --> 02:57:20.641]  How do we counter them?
[02:57:20.782 --> 02:57:23.303]  And then how do we create a counter narrative to defeat them?
[02:57:23.963 --> 02:57:26.405]  We've pretty much already done that by being prepared that it was coming.
[02:57:27.025 --> 02:57:29.887]  But I'm really going to try to develop
[02:57:32.609 --> 02:57:41.541]  Because, I mean, I've been asked, and it's not like some pat on the head deal by a lot of high-level people in the government, what I think we should do.
[02:57:42.082 --> 02:57:48.851]  And I think it's that question being asked me last week that's got me kind of, whoa, like, it's like, yeah, like, who's in charge?
[02:57:48.891 --> 02:57:49.692]  Well, you are!
[02:57:50.782 --> 02:57:56.786]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[02:58:04.091 --> 02:58:08.334]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:58:08.774 --> 02:58:12.037]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:58:12.937 --> 02:58:23.164]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.

[02:58:34.111 --> 02:58:42.641]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:58:50.911 --> 02:58:56.174]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:58:56.895 --> 02:59:00.197]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:59:01.057 --> 02:59:07.301]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:59:09.082 --> 02:59:15.424]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:59:16.244 --> 02:59:21.485]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:59:22.086 --> 02:59:30.808]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[02:59:31.368 --> 02:59:34.831]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the Resistance.
[03:00:12.631 --> 03:00:17.772]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.072 --> 03:00:21.013]  I'll take some more of your calls, but here's what's going on.
[03:00:21.053 --> 03:00:29.515]  There are major debates going on in the White House about how to counter this, and what to do about the deep state trying to overthrow the election and cause a civil war in their own words now.
[03:00:30.715 --> 03:00:39.117]  And because I've been able to predict what's going to happen, and I predicted this way ahead of time, and I have the website named InfoWars, and I've been right like 98% of the time.
[03:00:41.116 --> 03:00:42.177]  I'm not bragging to the audience.
[03:00:42.197 --> 03:00:44.078]  I'm just telling you why today I've been like flustered.
[03:00:44.138 --> 03:00:55.465]  It's like the Pentagon and the White House and other people asked me not, because when they used to ask me stuff, I thought it was like patting me on the head because I'm a constituent.
[03:00:55.885 --> 03:00:57.987]  It's like, no, we're not patting you on the head.
[03:00:59.005 --> 03:00:59.506]  What should we do?
[03:01:00.366 --> 03:01:02.849]  And it's not like I'm like in a survey of 20 people.
[03:01:02.909 --> 03:01:10.797]  It's like I'm in a room basically metaphysically with a few top generals and we got this stuff going on and they go, hey, this guy is almost always right.
[03:01:10.857 --> 03:01:11.418]  What do we do?
[03:01:12.039 --> 03:01:15.983]  And I think it's that responsibility
[03:01:18.711 --> 03:01:34.222]  For the first time in my life, it makes me not feel confident, so I've got to get in that place where I just go with all the research, but then my gut, which isn't my gut, it's my subconscious understanding, like Trump said, you've got to go with being shallow, because it's the deepest thing he ever did, because it's not shallow, it's the subconscious.
[03:01:35.803 --> 03:01:36.924]  And so that's basically it.
[03:01:37.725 --> 03:01:46.551]  That's why the media noticed, and I'll do an emergency message to Trump, and then two days later he says it word for word, because it meshes with what he already knows, he already knows it, but it pushes him over the edge.
[03:01:47.875 --> 03:01:51.236]  And that's why they go, Sean Hannity saying word for word what Jones says.
[03:01:51.256 --> 03:01:54.698]  Well that's because people that advise Hannity said, you know, the president thinks this is important.
[03:01:55.458 --> 03:01:58.819]  And so Media Matters Soros figured it out about a year ago.
[03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:06.742]  And I knew this, but that's why it's not like, oh yippee!
[03:02:07.443 --> 03:02:10.664]  I'm one of the main people advising the resistance movement.
[03:02:11.761 --> 03:02:29.035]  It's like, God Almighty, I mean, you know, I'm just here trying to get the public awake to what's going on, and I cannot believe that more people aren't behind Trump with the great job he's done, and all the things we've been up against, and how we've come back from nowhere, and how we're turning things around, and then all my fellow countrymen are a bunch of assholes, man.
[03:02:29.536 --> 03:02:32.158]  Not all of them, but a large part, a bunch of spoiled brats, and you know what?
[03:02:32.638 --> 03:02:34.480]  I'm not even sure this country deserves to recover.
[03:02:35.430 --> 03:02:36.290]  I'm serious, man.
[03:02:36.330 --> 03:02:37.331]  That makes me sad.
[03:02:37.731 --> 03:02:47.976]  That crazy Nazi collaborator is over there trying to destroy the country, and then my old friends follow the talking point and defend Soros and say he was a victim of the Nazis?
[03:02:48.537 --> 03:02:50.237]  Because that's showing what side they're on.
[03:02:50.297 --> 03:02:51.318]  That makes me sick!
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:57.141]  It should be such an obvious decision.
[03:03:00.034 --> 03:03:03.036]  And I want to go to your phone calls, and I got Joel Celente who's all fired up to take over.
[03:03:04.737 --> 03:03:08.879]  It's just... God, you look at Maxine Waters, man.
[03:03:08.919 --> 03:03:09.619]  That's a demon.
[03:03:10.900 --> 03:03:12.581]  And you look at all these other lying people.
[03:03:12.621 --> 03:03:13.682]  They know they're scum.
[03:03:13.722 --> 03:03:14.562]  They know they're lying.
[03:03:14.822 --> 03:03:16.463]  They know they're standing in the way of prosperity.
[03:03:16.843 --> 03:03:20.725]  She knows damn well she's run by Margaret Sanger and sitting there to abort as many blacks as she can.
[03:03:20.745 --> 03:03:22.666]  I mean, that's a monster, man.
[03:03:22.686 --> 03:03:23.607]  That is a monster.
[03:03:26.048 --> 03:03:28.810]  And it's just like, how many of these damn monsters do they got?
[03:03:30.410 --> 03:03:34.691]  I mean, you know, it's like, why do they have such bad will for everybody?
[03:03:34.731 --> 03:03:35.811]  Why don't they want peace?
[03:03:36.071 --> 03:03:37.351]  Why don't they want prosperity?
[03:03:37.371 --> 03:03:41.712]  And look at all their little weird constituents.
[03:03:42.933 --> 03:03:45.513]  Notice her constituents are a bunch of dumb-ass white people.
[03:03:45.793 --> 03:03:47.073]  And I'm going to say something right now.
[03:03:47.133 --> 03:03:48.734]  Our problem in this country is white people.
[03:03:49.314 --> 03:03:49.654]  It's true.
[03:03:49.694 --> 03:03:51.034]  It's liberal white people.
[03:03:51.354 --> 03:03:54.695]  They are the most racist, stupid, greedy, hateful.
[03:03:54.995 --> 03:04:00.076]  In my whole life, man, every time I ran into some weird neurotic crook, I'd go, oh, you're a Democrat.
[03:04:02.196 --> 03:04:04.197]  Now there's some of them that are just part of it because it's a cult.
[03:04:05.538 --> 03:04:07.139]  But most of them are a bunch of trash.
[03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:13.043]  All the Republicans I knew always wanted to save the country and we're Christians.
[03:04:13.983 --> 03:04:15.784]  Now some of these, I mean, look at Rob Reiner.
[03:04:15.804 --> 03:04:17.285]  That guy's such a race pimp.
[03:04:17.305 --> 03:04:18.906]  That guy is such a piece of crap.
[03:04:20.127 --> 03:04:22.008]  You know how racist they are in Hollywood?
[03:04:23.549 --> 03:04:27.752]  It's all these tapes come out of these Hollywood guys saying all these horrible things about black people.
[03:04:35.242 --> 03:04:36.423]  I got loaded phone lines here.
[03:04:36.443 --> 03:04:41.825]  I'll just, I'm going to take a few more and then go to Celente, but he's loaded for bear.
[03:04:42.426 --> 03:04:44.487]  Trent's Forecaster, and then the war room's coming up.
[03:04:45.307 --> 03:04:47.929]  But we are now entering a civil war right now.
[03:04:48.789 --> 03:04:51.470]  And you better decide which side you're on, that's all I'm telling you.
[03:04:52.071 --> 03:04:55.092]  And all you idiots out there, you know what?
[03:04:56.193 --> 03:05:01.896]  You guys want to get violent, I hope you don't, but let me tell you something, you try to hurt me or my family, I'm going to dispatch you faster than you blink.
[03:05:07.199 --> 03:05:10.281]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:05:10.321 --> 03:05:10.861]  You're on the air.
[03:05:10.881 --> 03:05:11.722]  Thanks for holding.
[03:05:11.802 --> 03:05:12.882]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:05:13.102 --> 03:05:13.703]  Hey, brother.
[03:05:14.003 --> 03:05:14.383]  Good, man.
[03:05:14.403 --> 03:05:15.203]  Thank you for calling.
[03:05:15.263 --> 03:05:15.824]  Hey, hey.
[03:05:15.944 --> 03:05:20.346]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:05:20.546 --> 03:05:26.930]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroflex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:05:27.050 --> 03:05:28.771]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[03:05:28.851 --> 03:05:35.815]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:05:36.175 --> 03:05:37.276]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:05:37.336 --> 03:05:39.779]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[03:05:39.839 --> 03:05:41.341]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:05:41.741 --> 03:05:43.423]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:05:43.803 --> 03:05:44.544]  And exactly.
[03:05:44.564 --> 03:05:48.808]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:05:49.149 --> 03:05:49.429]  Boom!
[03:05:49.569 --> 03:05:52.392]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:05:52.452 --> 03:05:52.993]  It's amazing.
[03:05:53.053 --> 03:05:54.334]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[03:05:54.414 --> 03:05:57.277]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:06:50.686 --> 03:06:52.515]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:52.616 --> 03:06:53.360]  Infowars.com.
[03:06:55.327 --> 03:06:56.388]  Newswars.com.
[03:06:56.748 --> 03:07:00.651]  Joe Celente, the Trends Forecaster of TrendsResearch.com is taking over here in just a few minutes.
[03:07:00.671 --> 03:07:03.254]  I was going to jam in Brad in North Texas.
[03:07:03.314 --> 03:07:07.217]  How bad will the anti-Trump derangement syndrome get?
[03:07:07.317 --> 03:07:13.962]  Because it's just getting to higher and higher heights as they call for violence, as they intimidate people, as they get in everybody's face.
[03:07:14.543 --> 03:07:17.005]  I see everybody exiting the blue states and blue cities.
[03:07:17.465 --> 03:07:20.027]  So, I mean, I love it at these anti-American
[03:07:20.708 --> 03:07:21.308]  Very interesting, Brad.
[03:07:41.141 --> 03:07:41.601]  All right, yeah.
[03:07:41.881 --> 03:07:42.822]  Let me tell you something, Alex.
[03:07:43.022 --> 03:07:46.864]  I'm currently 16 years old and I've been listening to you for about a year and a half.
[03:07:47.204 --> 03:07:48.145]  You really woke me up.
[03:07:48.625 --> 03:07:51.807]  And let me tell you something that happened to me about the last two weeks of school.
[03:07:52.727 --> 03:07:56.629]  So everyone at school knows that I'm a big Trump supporter.
[03:07:56.649 --> 03:07:58.290]  I'm an American traditionalist.
[03:07:58.330 --> 03:07:59.411]  I love the Second Amendment.
[03:08:00.251 --> 03:08:03.013]  So they misrepresented that and tried to get me sent to jail.
[03:08:03.493 --> 03:08:04.774]  They had the police come to my house.
[03:08:05.603 --> 03:08:09.985]  And some kids said that I was planning a school shooting on the last day.
[03:08:10.605 --> 03:08:12.206]  So they came to my house and checked that it was last day.
[03:08:12.226 --> 03:08:16.048]  Oh, that happened to a bunch of the pro-Trump people that went on TV.
[03:08:16.268 --> 03:08:21.411]  Three or four of the young men who were saying we're pro-gun, they all got visits too in Parkland.
[03:08:22.391 --> 03:08:28.394]  Right, and the police officer that came, he's an NRA member, and he even said that this is total BS and that this is a waste of time and that we're sorry.
[03:08:30.255 --> 03:08:31.856]  But let me get to what else I wanted to say.
[03:08:33.196 --> 03:08:34.797]  The way that these leftists are is that
[03:08:35.936 --> 03:08:40.640]  They're like this because their parents never gave them enough time when they were younger.
[03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:42.901]  Their parents were obviously too busy at work.
[03:08:43.522 --> 03:08:44.763]  Their parents are rich.
[03:08:45.343 --> 03:08:47.144]  On average, leftist parents are very rich.
[03:08:48.365 --> 03:08:48.525]  Yes.
[03:08:48.545 --> 03:08:55.851]  So they've got these jobs that they have to work on, and they're not there at home giving their kids enough time.
[03:08:56.391 --> 03:08:58.773]  I've seen this all over my school.
[03:08:58.853 --> 03:08:59.874]  It's just crazy, man.
[03:09:03.311 --> 03:09:06.073]  How bad is it going to get as they call for violence against everybody?
[03:09:07.594 --> 03:09:13.237]  Well, I think by the end of this year, there might be a bomb that goes off.
[03:09:13.657 --> 03:09:18.480]  Somewhere in the country, there was one that was going to happen at Pier 39 on Christmas Day that was stopped.
[03:09:18.541 --> 03:09:19.041]  Remember that?
[03:09:19.181 --> 03:09:19.461]  Yes.
[03:09:20.522 --> 03:09:23.904]  I think that they're going to try a bomb attack by the end of this year.
[03:09:26.960 --> 03:09:29.142]  I think they're going to false flag too, or certainly foment it.
[03:09:29.162 --> 03:09:29.622]  Thank you so much.
[03:09:29.642 --> 03:09:31.524]  I'm going to get Gerald Cilente's take on that in just a moment.
[03:09:32.004 --> 03:09:33.325]  And these other callers I don't get to.
[03:09:33.365 --> 03:09:33.785]  I apologize.
[03:09:33.805 --> 03:09:36.387]  I'm trying to get to everybody here, but I went over and Gerald's here.
[03:09:36.407 --> 03:09:38.209]  I certainly want to hear what he has to say.
[03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:43.993]  But let's go ahead and take one more call and we're going to go to Gerald Cilente.
[03:09:45.535 --> 03:09:48.337]  Let's go ahead and talk to Marcos in New York.
[03:09:48.377 --> 03:09:49.558]  Marcos, what do you think is going on?
[03:09:51.519 --> 03:09:55.361]  Yeah, I just want to emphasize the fact that it really is a full-spectrum attack.
[03:09:55.701 --> 03:10:02.005]  So if you look at it physiologically, it's the chemicals, the food, it baddens us up, it makes us useless.
[03:10:02.785 --> 03:10:07.047]  Spiritually, you know, they bully Christians into saying that they can't say Christ during Christmas.
[03:10:07.527 --> 03:10:10.849]  And I love the fact that President Trump pointed that out.
[03:10:11.489 --> 03:10:13.591]  Um, and biologically, it's an attack.
[03:10:13.951 --> 03:10:22.779]  The eugenics, the abortion, um, and what I really notice is that when people are depressed, uh, you know, they don't function right, and it's easier to manipulate them.
[03:10:22.819 --> 03:10:28.283]  They're more on, you know, the wavelengths of evil, um, and they start doubting God and all this kind of stuff.
[03:10:29.104 --> 03:10:34.408]  Um, another thing I really wanted to point out was that I don't think that the world's a simulation.
[03:10:34.468 --> 03:10:36.490]  I think people need to realize that this is
[03:10:37.176 --> 03:10:38.658]  The real world.
[03:10:39.419 --> 03:10:45.486]  One thing you could do to test this would be to ask whoever is running this stimulation to take you out of it.
[03:10:45.566 --> 03:10:46.427]  Beg them to do that.
[03:10:47.248 --> 03:10:51.152]  If that doesn't work out for you, then reach out to God and see what's more powerful.
[03:10:52.674 --> 03:10:54.095]  Well, you'll absolutely find out there.
[03:10:54.175 --> 03:10:54.656]  I hear you.
[03:10:55.117 --> 03:10:57.780]  But you talk about civil war amongst the elites.
[03:10:59.369 --> 03:11:08.351]  Yes, I was told that we are speaking about the Civil War, and yeah, it really is amongst the elites.
[03:11:08.411 --> 03:11:15.633]  You see President Trump finally firing back against the corrupt FBI that's been screwing us over for years.
[03:11:16.574 --> 03:11:20.695]  And I also want to talk about what's next, because you're always asking what's next, what's next.
[03:11:22.273 --> 03:11:22.613]  I don't know.
[03:11:40.166 --> 03:11:42.267]  Alchemical stories, archetypically.
[03:11:42.707 --> 03:11:51.029]  So you see, like, in the 1600s, they decided to stop focusing on the Philosopher's Stone, which is the key to manipulating matter, right?
[03:11:51.069 --> 03:11:59.952]  And they decided to start looking towards the Humunculi Duo, so that they could create the artificial man.
[03:12:00.512 --> 03:12:06.614]  And you see that with the... And that's what they believe, they're gonna make the synthetic silicon man, and we're obsolete.
[03:12:07.614 --> 03:12:09.575]  And the parallels to the Bible are just
[03:12:10.442 --> 03:12:12.983]  Like, Alex, I can't believe the times that we're living in.
[03:12:13.103 --> 03:12:15.424]  Man, I just, I really appreciate you, man.
[03:12:15.444 --> 03:12:16.925]  Like, we pray for you.
[03:12:17.005 --> 03:12:18.185]  Marcos, I appreciate you.
[03:12:18.266 --> 03:12:19.646]  I gotta jump, and I appreciate you.
[03:12:19.666 --> 03:12:21.107]  But let me go to Gerald Cilenti, taking over now.
[03:12:21.407 --> 03:12:22.447]  Gerald, let me ask that question.
[03:12:22.888 --> 03:12:24.528]  You've got Democrats saying get violent.
[03:12:24.588 --> 03:12:26.029]  You've got them saying civil war.
[03:12:26.069 --> 03:12:27.870]  Mainstream media admits they want civil war now.
[03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:32.252]  You've got Bill Maher saying crash the economy to teach Americans a lesson.
[03:12:32.612 --> 03:12:33.192]  Defending it.
[03:12:33.592 --> 03:12:37.074]  Saying he hopes that, you know, Mike Cernovich and I commit suicide Friday night.
[03:12:38.064 --> 03:12:40.166]  I mean, they're doing all this.
[03:12:40.486 --> 03:12:41.608]  They're getting more and more desperate.
[03:12:41.628 --> 03:12:46.692]  You've got all these former CIA heads saying that they're going to overthrow the presidency.
[03:12:47.293 --> 03:12:51.057]  If they already lost the election and the economy... I mean, how do they think they're going to get away with this?
[03:12:51.417 --> 03:12:53.279]  What is the political point we're in right now?
[03:12:53.299 --> 03:12:55.001]  Because I know you're a political atheist.
[03:12:55.021 --> 03:12:57.223]  Trump isn't perfect, but he's seen as a populist.
[03:12:57.623 --> 03:12:59.085]  He's seen as an anti-globalist.
[03:12:59.985 --> 03:13:02.248]  And they're facing this problem around the world, so definitely...
[03:13:03.740 --> 03:13:05.762]  In my view, the elites are trying to take out Trump.
[03:13:06.302 --> 03:13:07.003]  A, is that right?
[03:13:07.063 --> 03:13:07.723]  B, is that wrong?
[03:13:07.743 --> 03:13:10.225]  And what would you call the political period we're in right now?
[03:13:10.265 --> 03:13:11.626]  My good friend, Gerald, please take over.
[03:13:12.647 --> 03:13:13.508]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[03:13:13.768 --> 03:13:16.670]  And again, you know, I am a political atheist.
[03:13:16.710 --> 03:13:20.213]  I look at things for the way they are and not the way I want them to be.
[03:13:20.253 --> 03:13:22.034]  So you mentioned Bill Maher.
[03:13:22.074 --> 03:13:24.516]  You mentioned the mainstream media.
[03:13:24.917 --> 03:13:32.963]  You left out Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto and any other stupid comic moronic cartoon character.
[03:13:33.581 --> 03:13:37.443]  Why would anyone care what they have to say?
[03:13:38.263 --> 03:13:41.184]  And why would anyone appear on their shows?
[03:13:41.724 --> 03:13:57.611]  Why would any adult with a brain bigger than a grain of sand care what De Niro, Mayer, or any of these jerks, and I could use another word, it's opposite of on, say?
[03:13:58.651 --> 03:14:00.852]  And to me, the greatest mistake
[03:14:01.753 --> 03:14:11.758]  That the Trump White House is making and the message that I would give them is why do you speak to prostitutes?
[03:14:12.859 --> 03:14:16.641]  Why do you speak to people that get paid to put out?
[03:14:17.461 --> 03:14:22.844]  Why do you go on shows with little Jimmy Kimmel dumb comics?
[03:14:23.805 --> 03:14:25.606]  Why are you doing this?
[03:14:26.166 --> 03:14:29.828]  I remember once upon a time not too long ago
[03:14:30.618 --> 03:14:39.600]  There was this guy named Alex Jones who went on with Piers Morgan and gave it to Piers in 70 different directions.
[03:14:40.260 --> 03:14:43.641]  And then they ended up throwing the little boy out afterwards.
[03:14:44.261 --> 03:14:46.421]  And you don't do it and I don't do it.
[03:14:47.041 --> 03:14:54.663]  If I got a call that Anderson Cooper or that little lemon that would like to get squeezed,
[03:14:56.267 --> 03:14:59.948]  What do I want to talk to these little jerks of nothing?
[03:14:59.968 --> 03:15:03.209]  These little boys and girls of nothing?
[03:15:04.129 --> 03:15:07.870]  So now let's put it into the real perspective when I say that.
[03:15:08.410 --> 03:15:09.910]  And what means the most?
[03:15:10.551 --> 03:15:12.811]  It means the most for the bottom line.
[03:15:13.511 --> 03:15:15.512]  And the bottom line is very clear.
[03:15:15.532 --> 03:15:24.714]  All American survey, 51% approve of Trump's handling of the economy.
[03:15:25.390 --> 03:15:26.750]  And that's not old news.
[03:15:27.731 --> 03:15:30.211]  11 hours ago, CNBC.
[03:15:31.511 --> 03:15:33.932]  So you can see what to do and where to go.
[03:15:33.952 --> 03:15:36.713]  You stay off these stupid networks.
[03:15:38.233 --> 03:15:39.473]  Don't waste your time.
[03:15:41.134 --> 03:15:42.494]  Go in a new direction.
[03:15:43.434 --> 03:15:44.675]  Go to the People Direct.
[03:15:45.175 --> 03:15:45.775]  Be right back.
[03:15:46.584 --> 03:15:49.126]  That's Gerald Cilente with TrendsResearch.com.
[03:15:49.146 --> 03:15:53.408]  On the other side, be sure and go check it out and get a subscription to the Trends Research Journal.
[03:15:53.448 --> 03:15:55.189]  You may think you know it all, but you learn a lot there.
[03:15:55.570 --> 03:15:59.112]  Plus, it supports what he's doing, and it's great to give friends and family to wake them up.
[03:16:09.330 --> 03:16:10.311]  Dr. Shiva's our guest.
[03:16:10.711 --> 03:16:11.951]  Great guy running for Senate.
[03:16:12.271 --> 03:16:13.172]  Got a shot at winning.
[03:16:13.192 --> 03:16:15.713]  And Elizabeth Warren, really a smart engineer.
[03:16:15.953 --> 03:16:16.993]  Very successful businessman.
[03:16:17.314 --> 03:16:18.054]  Inventor of email.
[03:16:18.114 --> 03:16:18.474]  Look it up.
[03:16:18.554 --> 03:16:19.014]  It's true.
[03:16:19.194 --> 03:16:28.459]  And he is running against Elizabeth Warren, who will not do the genetic test, who the tribes say she has no connection to in Oklahoma or other areas.
[03:16:28.519 --> 03:16:31.480]  But he's a real Indian from the subcontinent, India.
[03:16:31.540 --> 03:16:32.420]  But he's a great patriot.
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:33.281]  I'd love to get him in the U.S.
[03:16:33.321 --> 03:16:33.601]  Senate.
[03:16:33.641 --> 03:16:38.403]  Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, thanks for joining us with some big, breaking, exclusive news.
[03:16:38.643 --> 03:16:43.085]  You know, we got this big sign out here, you may have seen it, you know, only the real Indian can defeat the fake Indian.
[03:16:43.385 --> 03:16:59.612]  It's a very powerful meme, Alex, and I want to really explain why it's so powerful and why we put it out there, because it really is an expression of not only my anger, but pretty much everyone's anger at the corruption that is taking place in government, and Elizabeth Warren is the face of that corruption.
[03:16:59.632 --> 03:17:07.535]  So when we put that signage up on our bus, the city of Cambridge, which is supposed to be the most liberal haven on the planet, said we had to take it down.
[03:17:08.475 --> 03:17:10.516]  That was on April 5th, 2018.
[03:17:10.576 --> 03:17:11.257]  We didn't do that.
[03:17:11.277 --> 03:17:15.879]  In fact, we retaliated hard and we sued them, took them to federal court, and we won.
[03:17:16.239 --> 03:17:19.400]  They surrendered completely.
[03:17:19.960 --> 03:17:23.382]  And, you know, then based on that, we dismissed the court case.
[03:17:23.422 --> 03:17:26.403]  Obviously, the mainstream media did not want to cover our victory.
[03:17:26.924 --> 03:17:29.525]  So what we realize, Alex, the big news is this.
[03:17:30.085 --> 03:17:31.946]  And this is something that's really, really important.
[03:17:31.966 --> 03:17:36.628]  You see, for far too long, the establishment has made politics
[03:17:37.328 --> 03:17:40.990]  A, uh, essentially a, uh, you know, an audience sport, right?
[03:17:41.290 --> 03:17:45.351]  They do not want the everyday citizen to actually be involved in that aspect.
[03:17:45.391 --> 03:17:47.872]  They want to make it the old Hollywood celebrity culture.
[03:17:47.912 --> 03:17:52.214]  You put a couple of people on pedestals and we're supposed to watch them and eat our popcorn.
[03:17:52.274 --> 03:17:56.536]  So what we've done here, Alex, is that's becoming really powerful is we've figured out the victory to winning.
[03:17:56.696 --> 03:18:05.640]  And what we realized was people say, you know what, you guys have a lot of courage to put that out there because you're bringing out something in Massachusetts that people do not want to talk about.
[03:18:05.720 --> 03:18:07.981]  It's a weaponized way of getting across our message.
[03:18:08.001 --> 03:18:10.922]  So what we've done is, you see these magnetic signs here?
[03:18:10.942 --> 03:18:12.103]  They're really easy.
[03:18:12.483 --> 03:18:16.184]  So we want to replicate this all over the state, Alex.
[03:18:16.224 --> 03:18:17.265]  In fact, all over the country.
[03:18:17.825 --> 03:18:34.911]  And basically people can buy these magnetic signs you can see as you're showing being put on and where since we launched we have you know tons of people starting to write and wanting these and why is that and the reality is when Elizabeth Warren it's not about identity right the liberals want to convert it to a race issue
[03:18:35.151 --> 03:18:36.431]  But it has nothing to do with race.
[03:18:36.491 --> 03:18:38.352]  It has to do with integrity.
[03:18:38.372 --> 03:18:41.933]  We're talking about someone who did not work hard, who cut in line.
[03:18:42.273 --> 03:18:46.294]  You, me, Alex, and pretty much every American watching your show works for a living.
[03:18:46.314 --> 03:18:48.115]  You know, I mowed lawns as a kid.
[03:18:48.475 --> 03:18:52.316]  You know, learned to engineer software as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid.
[03:18:52.336 --> 03:18:53.856]  I've been working all my life.
[03:18:54.156 --> 03:18:57.477]  But Elizabeth Warren cut in front of line, and they do not want to discuss that.
[03:18:57.537 --> 03:19:03.099]  So we are bringing up not just the race issue, because for far too long, down the street is Harvard University.
[03:19:03.659 --> 03:19:12.545]  The white liberal racists who want us to keep us all on their reservation and plantation have bounded the discussion of race, Alex, and they don't know what to do with us.
[03:19:12.825 --> 03:19:15.847]  Because when we bring up that sign, they'll say, oh, that's racist.
[03:19:15.907 --> 03:19:16.627]  We'll say, really?
[03:19:17.008 --> 03:19:23.972]  And we'll flip it back and we say, look, you're the racist because you're supporting a woman who took advantage of race to get in and when she's not of that race.
[03:19:24.312 --> 03:19:28.535]  How do folks, even though they're not in Massachusetts, how do they get one of these babies?
[03:19:28.715 --> 03:19:29.295]  It's very easy.
[03:19:29.315 --> 03:19:31.037]  You just go to shiva4senate.com.
[03:19:31.277 --> 03:19:32.257]  You can find it right there.
[03:19:32.277 --> 03:19:33.658]  It's called a Road Warrior Kit.
[03:19:33.698 --> 03:19:34.479]  Go to the store.
[03:19:34.819 --> 03:19:36.000]  Get the Road Warrior Kit.
[03:19:36.040 --> 03:19:36.540]  We've made it.
[03:19:36.780 --> 03:19:38.061]  You get two magnetic stickers.
[03:19:38.081 --> 03:19:38.882]  You get a lawn sign.
[03:19:38.902 --> 03:19:39.943]  You get two bumper stickers.
[03:19:40.523 --> 03:19:40.843]  Oh my god.
[03:19:40.863 --> 03:19:42.885]  You gotta call this Operation Road Warrior.
[03:19:42.905 --> 03:19:43.665]  Is that what you're calling it?
[03:19:43.685 --> 03:19:44.245]  That's what I call it.
[03:19:44.285 --> 03:19:45.366]  It's called Road Warrior.
[03:19:45.626 --> 03:19:46.687]  Be a Road Warrior.
[03:19:46.947 --> 03:19:48.148]  That's getting back.
[03:19:48.628 --> 03:19:52.271]  So if you can't come to and pass out cards, you can't do anything.
[03:19:52.291 --> 03:19:53.091]  You know, you got family.
[03:19:53.452 --> 03:19:54.792]  Hey, I'm fully supporting this.
[03:19:55.293 --> 03:19:56.253]  But I am stealing the idea.
[03:19:56.273 --> 03:19:58.175]  We're gonna launch Operation Road Warrior with our stuff too.
[03:20:05.443 --> 03:20:10.128]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:13.172 --> 03:20:18.238]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:20:21.644 --> 03:20:22.705]  Hey, welcome back.
[03:20:22.745 --> 03:20:23.425]  Welcome back.
[03:20:23.506 --> 03:20:34.514]  And it's always great being on with Alex Jones and all that they do to bring you information way outside the box.
[03:20:35.235 --> 03:20:38.297]  And again, it's not only fake news that's out there.
[03:20:38.717 --> 03:20:40.058]  We're getting dumbed down news.
[03:20:40.138 --> 03:20:42.440]  I wonder what Stormy Daniels is doing today.
[03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:45.462]  I mean, that's the stupid stuff that you get.
[03:20:45.763 --> 03:20:48.625]  And with trends, what we do is we give you news you can use.
[03:20:49.628 --> 03:20:53.369]  I want to stay on what I was mentioning about with Alex.
[03:20:54.410 --> 03:20:56.811]  So, you get two different impressions.
[03:20:57.431 --> 03:21:00.372]  Yeah, Trump could have a 41% approval rating.
[03:21:00.392 --> 03:21:01.833]  It doesn't mean anything.
[03:21:02.953 --> 03:21:07.795]  Matter of fact, I had an election over there in Turkey yesterday.
[03:21:08.195 --> 03:21:11.636]  Erdogan, the president, just extended a 15-year run.
[03:21:11.656 --> 03:21:16.638]  And you look at all the media in the U.S., and it looked like it was going to come to an end.
[03:21:17.078 --> 03:21:18.079]  Could he win the votes?
[03:21:19.417 --> 03:21:22.278]  And if you look at the polls, the polls will say a different story.
[03:21:23.118 --> 03:21:25.238]  So as I mentioned, it's the bottom line.
[03:21:26.039 --> 03:21:33.600]  And on the bottom line, 51% approve of Trump's handling of the economy.
[03:21:35.241 --> 03:21:38.341]  So then you look at other gallop.
[03:21:39.882 --> 03:21:41.562]  Satisfaction with U.S.
[03:21:41.582 --> 03:21:43.583]  direction reaches 12-year high.
[03:21:48.177 --> 03:21:53.280]  38% of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the United States.
[03:21:56.542 --> 03:22:05.708]  Similar to last month's 37% satisfaction rate, but making the numerical high since a 39% reading in December of 2005.
[03:22:05.748 --> 03:22:08.490]  Now go back to 2005, and the real estate market's booming.
[03:22:15.931 --> 03:22:21.853]  So I would suggest to the White House, your public relations stinks.
[03:22:23.073 --> 03:22:25.614]  Stop doing these stupid things that you're doing.
[03:22:26.435 --> 03:22:33.817]  Stop appearing on TV with the prostitutes that get paid to put out and they're going to go after you.
[03:22:34.797 --> 03:22:36.858]  And just keep sticking with the facts.
[03:22:37.598 --> 03:22:38.839]  And here's some other facts.
[03:22:39.939 --> 03:22:42.080]  When you hear what the CNN says,
[03:22:44.071 --> 03:22:52.698]  Or a MSNBC, or an ABC, or CBS, or a WHOCARES.
[03:22:54.139 --> 03:22:56.061]  They have very small audiences.
[03:22:57.041 --> 03:22:59.363]  Alex has a bigger audience than they do.
[03:23:00.965 --> 03:23:06.829]  You look at, you know, Anderson Cooper over there on CNN at prime time.
[03:23:07.490 --> 03:23:09.852]  You're looking, what do we have, a nation of 320 million people?
[03:23:13.857 --> 03:23:17.358]  And out of that 320 million people, how many are watching him?
[03:23:18.478 --> 03:23:18.998]  Anderson?
[03:23:19.639 --> 03:23:23.920]  Again, a boy born on third base and thought he hit a home run.
[03:23:24.620 --> 03:23:28.881]  He'd be nowhere if his mama wasn't Gloria Vanderbilt.
[03:23:30.882 --> 03:23:34.563]  So again, stay off.
[03:23:35.843 --> 03:23:36.643]  Meet the press.
[03:23:36.943 --> 03:23:38.144]  Meet the prostitutes.
[03:23:38.684 --> 03:23:39.964]  What are you doing it for?
[03:23:41.345 --> 03:23:42.425]  You don't have to.
[03:23:43.712 --> 03:23:45.612]  They're only selling agendas.
[03:23:46.373 --> 03:23:47.753]  So sell your platform.
[03:23:48.933 --> 03:23:58.535]  Another positive one, as I mentioned, with Trump, that's not making the news, and that the so-called liberal Democrats are fighting.
[03:24:00.335 --> 03:24:05.757]  Pentagon indefinitely suspends more war games with South Korea.
[03:24:07.777 --> 03:24:08.817]  That was a positive.
[03:24:10.257 --> 03:24:12.778]  But you have Democrats that are coming out against it.
[03:24:13.953 --> 03:24:16.914]  Because the Democrats have essentially turned into war hawks.
[03:24:18.094 --> 03:24:18.794]  Don't believe me?
[03:24:18.814 --> 03:24:20.515]  How about this?
[03:24:21.635 --> 03:24:24.435]  Democrats back massive Pentagon budget.
[03:24:26.376 --> 03:24:27.016]  And here they go.
[03:24:27.056 --> 03:24:28.376]  This is hardly in the news.
[03:24:28.476 --> 03:24:30.817]  And again, I'm a political atheist.
[03:24:30.897 --> 03:24:32.497]  I like some things that Trump does.
[03:24:32.517 --> 03:24:34.558]  And I disagree with others.
[03:24:35.598 --> 03:24:37.619]  As you know, I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:24:37.979 --> 03:24:39.079]  I'm a man of peace.
[03:24:39.099 --> 03:24:42.140]  I'm not a pacifist, like Alex Jones says.
[03:24:42.660 --> 03:24:43.360]  You mess with me,
[03:24:44.508 --> 03:24:46.109]  Be prepared for the results.
[03:24:46.689 --> 03:24:49.731]  I'm not here to give it yet out or take it.
[03:24:50.412 --> 03:24:53.234]  So if you're going to come after me, you better be ready.
[03:24:54.214 --> 03:25:01.579]  So I'm not a pacifist, but I honor the founding fathers and the founding fathers did not want foreign entanglements.
[03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:07.923]  So you look at they just had a vote last week and only seven.
[03:25:10.484 --> 03:25:12.886]  Out of 47 Democratic senators,
[03:25:14.326 --> 03:25:15.207]  Voted nay.
[03:25:17.448 --> 03:25:19.950]  Ensuring passage of this huge bill.
[03:25:20.511 --> 03:25:29.637]  To put into perspective, they just added $82 billion into the defense budget.
[03:25:30.758 --> 03:25:32.959]  You know what Russia's total defense budget is?
[03:25:33.780 --> 03:25:36.722]  Now again, we're looking at a defense budget in the United States.
[03:25:36.742 --> 03:25:39.804]  This is without intelligence, homeland security, and all that.
[03:25:40.165 --> 03:25:41.626]  Without that, at $716 billion.
[03:25:45.905 --> 03:25:49.306]  They increased it by $82 billion, to bring it to that number.
[03:25:52.027 --> 03:25:55.608]  Russia's total budget?
[03:25:55.628 --> 03:25:56.088]  $61 billion.
[03:25:58.068 --> 03:26:02.070]  Between 2017 and 2009, they increased the defense budget $105 billion.
[03:26:02.090 --> 03:26:06.091]  That $105 billion is bigger than China's budget.
[03:26:15.535 --> 03:26:23.159]  So, again, I look at what it is and the way, you know, the motto of the Trends Journal, think for yourself.
[03:26:23.739 --> 03:26:31.423]  But when it comes to tariffs, when it comes to immigration, no more people and we need tariffs.
[03:26:31.663 --> 03:26:35.505]  Again, I don't, I disagree with taking the kids away from the parents.
[03:26:35.565 --> 03:26:37.206]  I mean, a little kid, you're traumatized.
[03:26:37.706 --> 03:26:43.048]  But I don't want any more people coming into the country just like they did after the Great Depression.
[03:26:43.629 --> 03:26:44.229]  They waited.
[03:26:44.878 --> 03:26:46.800]  Until the country got back on its feet.
[03:26:47.380 --> 03:26:55.287]  And it wasn't only until the 1960s, way after World War II, that they started loosening the immigration policies.
[03:26:56.128 --> 03:26:58.130]  So I say we have enough right now.
[03:26:58.950 --> 03:27:01.032]  We need to take care of ourselves.
[03:27:01.753 --> 03:27:06.697]  And going back to the trade policy, I'm 100% behind Trump on that.
[03:27:07.518 --> 03:27:10.981]  Because I believe in a self-sustaining economy.
[03:27:12.290 --> 03:27:23.077]  Nah, don't put tariffs on prosciutto, or French wine, or great food that you can't get here coming in from another country, or if I want to buy an expensive luxury item.
[03:27:24.038 --> 03:27:32.704]  Why should 97% of the shirt, shoes, and all the clothing that we wear come from foreign countries, when we could be making it here?
[03:27:33.424 --> 03:27:37.827]  It's only so the multinationals can make more money, and that's why they've done it.
[03:27:38.788 --> 03:27:40.829]  They've exported our jobs.
[03:27:41.667 --> 03:27:42.808]  Don't blame China.
[03:27:42.868 --> 03:27:45.230]  Blame the major corporations for doing it.
[03:27:45.710 --> 03:27:47.611]  They're the ones that sold us out.
[03:27:48.512 --> 03:27:50.033]  China couldn't make anything.
[03:27:50.834 --> 03:27:55.697]  Before the United States and Europe, manufacturers gave them the technology.
[03:27:56.598 --> 03:27:58.680]  So I'm a made-in-America man.
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:01.402]  And that's why I am who I am.
[03:28:01.942 --> 03:28:04.704]  My blood is Italian, but my heart's American.
[03:28:05.538 --> 03:28:07.099]  I'm made in U.S.A.
[03:28:07.599 --> 03:28:12.180]  I couldn't be me if I was born in Attavale Erpino or Vicoquens in Italy.
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:16.342]  I'm only me because I'm a Napolitano from the Bronx.
[03:28:17.122 --> 03:28:21.683]  And I appreciate everything that America has given me.
[03:28:22.223 --> 03:28:23.824]  And I want to buy American.
[03:28:24.324 --> 03:28:28.485]  And that's the message that's missing in a lot of, I think, what Trump is doing.
[03:28:29.146 --> 03:28:30.886]  A self-sustaining economy.
[03:28:31.686 --> 03:28:33.247]  We don't need anybody else.
[03:28:33.939 --> 03:28:37.801]  We are rich in resources, natural and human.
[03:28:38.722 --> 03:28:40.383]  To me, it's build America.
[03:28:41.264 --> 03:28:43.565]  We can't take on any more people now.
[03:28:44.526 --> 03:28:46.407]  And I'm going to talk more about that later.
[03:28:48.248 --> 03:28:50.889]  So, I'm going to be back in a few minutes.
[03:28:50.909 --> 03:28:52.911]  I'm going to hit on this.
[03:28:53.911 --> 03:28:56.813]  And remember, support Alex Jones.
[03:28:57.093 --> 03:28:59.575]  Put your money where your mind is, and your heart.
[03:29:01.049 --> 03:29:02.810]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:30:00.618 --> 03:30:05.079]  Alpha Power Vital Male Androgen Biosynthesis Promoter.
[03:30:05.240 --> 03:30:13.123]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[03:30:13.563 --> 03:30:15.184]  But here's what you want to know.
[03:30:16.152 --> 03:30:22.114]  You want to go to mfulmorestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[03:30:22.774 --> 03:30:26.315]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[03:30:27.196 --> 03:30:35.198]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[03:30:35.778 --> 03:30:43.441]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[03:30:44.241 --> 03:30:48.031]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[03:30:48.592 --> 03:30:49.394]  It's Alpha Power.
[03:30:49.454 --> 03:30:52.562]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[03:30:53.627 --> 03:31:08.501]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[03:31:08.921 --> 03:31:14.306]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[03:31:14.586 --> 03:31:16.128]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[03:31:16.428 --> 03:31:17.749]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[03:31:17.769 --> 03:31:22.352]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpha Power because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[03:31:22.912 --> 03:31:27.215]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[03:31:27.235 --> 03:31:28.576]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[03:31:29.396 --> 03:31:36.161]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[03:31:36.181 --> 03:31:38.062]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[03:31:38.682 --> 03:31:40.243]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[03:31:40.263 --> 03:31:41.384]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[03:31:41.424 --> 03:31:43.085]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[03:31:45.987 --> 03:31:46.848]  But here's an example.
[03:31:47.669 --> 03:31:55.257]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[03:31:55.277 --> 03:31:56.978]  It just has a little bit in it.
[03:31:57.459 --> 03:32:03.625]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[03:32:04.306 --> 03:32:09.391]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[03:32:09.691 --> 03:32:18.018]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[03:32:18.438 --> 03:32:19.459]  Nobody else does that.
[03:32:19.539 --> 03:32:22.202]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[03:32:22.722 --> 03:32:38.855]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[03:32:39.275 --> 03:32:48.241]  So you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[03:32:48.581 --> 03:32:50.602]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[03:32:50.983 --> 03:32:56.466]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[03:32:56.506 --> 03:32:57.106]  A total 360 win.
[03:32:57.147 --> 03:32:58.347]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.901 --> 03:33:25.783]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[03:33:26.363 --> 03:33:29.624]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[03:33:32.966 --> 03:33:34.026]  And here we are.
[03:33:34.746 --> 03:33:36.467]  Not quite Austin, Texas.
[03:33:36.667 --> 03:33:38.007]  Uptown, Kingstown.
[03:33:38.428 --> 03:33:39.788]  Colonial Kingston, New York.
[03:33:39.808 --> 03:33:42.209]  This is Gerald Cilenti hosting
[03:33:43.001 --> 03:33:45.963]  The next half hour of this show, thank you so much for having me on.
[03:33:46.003 --> 03:33:49.645]  It's always an honor being on InfoWars.
[03:33:49.785 --> 03:33:55.749]  And again, what Alex Jones does in InfoWars is keeps the public awake.
[03:33:56.330 --> 03:33:57.310]  And boy, you know it.
[03:33:57.851 --> 03:34:00.913]  Now, before I was talking about the migrant crisis going on.
[03:34:01.793 --> 03:34:06.597]  And again, to me, the negatives about it was, you know, not taking the kids away.
[03:34:06.617 --> 03:34:07.837]  I don't agree with that at all.
[03:34:08.378 --> 03:34:11.680]  But I am definitely in favor of securing the borders.
[03:34:12.970 --> 03:34:22.776]  Matter of fact, one of my elements of Occupy Peace is to close all the bases overseas, bring home... What are we doing with bases in Germany and Italy and all these places?
[03:34:22.816 --> 03:34:28.079]  Bring home the troops and secure the homeland as part of Occupy Peace.
[03:34:28.260 --> 03:34:34.523]  But other element of securing the homeland is, you know, we have to get back on our feet here.
[03:34:35.324 --> 03:34:38.506]  We had median household income at 1999 levels.
[03:34:41.167 --> 03:34:44.909]  We have to grow America and build America in many different ways.
[03:34:45.350 --> 03:34:47.131]  We can't take on more people now.
[03:34:47.831 --> 03:34:49.632]  We have to deal with the problems we have.
[03:34:49.652 --> 03:34:52.494]  We have a lousy, stinking, rotting infrastructure.
[03:34:52.934 --> 03:34:56.516]  Oh, by the way, that's another element of our Occupy piece.
[03:34:56.616 --> 03:35:01.399]  Back in the 1930s, they had what was called a WPA.
[03:35:01.779 --> 03:35:03.060]  Even made songs about it.
[03:35:03.941 --> 03:35:04.581]  WPA.
[03:35:05.381 --> 03:35:07.303]  Works Progress Administration.
[03:35:07.963 --> 03:35:09.424]  Hey, you know that thing, the Hoover Dam?
[03:35:10.439 --> 03:35:13.761]  All those bridges that were built in the 1930s?
[03:35:14.682 --> 03:35:14.922]  Yep.
[03:35:15.702 --> 03:35:16.483]  WPA.
[03:35:17.863 --> 03:35:19.124]  I want a TPA.
[03:35:19.524 --> 03:35:21.806]  A Troops Progress Administration.
[03:35:23.087 --> 03:35:28.330]  Yeah, I'll give $714 billion to the Defense Department.
[03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:32.132]  Put the troops to work rebuilding our rotted infrastructure.
[03:35:32.292 --> 03:35:38.976]  And you'll give them good jobs and skills, rather than playing these war games over and over again.
[03:35:39.967 --> 03:35:40.507]  Saluting.
[03:35:41.328 --> 03:35:42.648]  So, that's part of it.
[03:35:42.728 --> 03:35:44.029]  Going back to immigration.
[03:35:45.469 --> 03:35:46.310]  And migration.
[03:35:46.890 --> 03:35:48.150]  Two major issues here.
[03:35:49.691 --> 03:35:51.332]  Let's go overseas for a second.
[03:35:52.952 --> 03:35:57.794]  Tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, where we go, and how we got here.
[03:35:58.635 --> 03:36:00.616]  Or how we got here, where we are, and where we're going.
[03:36:01.156 --> 03:36:02.997]  So current events form future trends.
[03:36:03.017 --> 03:36:06.818]  So each day, I go through newspapers and go online.
[03:36:08.239 --> 03:36:08.859]  I go to the
[03:36:09.361 --> 03:36:13.884]  Chinese websites, the Iranian, the Arab, you know, well, Israeli.
[03:36:14.324 --> 03:36:15.805]  I just want to see what everybody's saying.
[03:36:16.886 --> 03:36:28.674]  So the headline story today in the Financial Times, Italy disrupts summit to save Merkel with call to rip up European Union migrant system.
[03:36:30.876 --> 03:36:37.400]  The five star movement in Lega, the Italian movements, they're anti-immigration.
[03:36:38.146 --> 03:36:41.107]  Anti-immigration is sweeping throughout Europe.
[03:36:42.107 --> 03:36:44.808]  They want to maintain their national identity.
[03:36:47.649 --> 03:36:49.390]  Can anybody handle that?
[03:36:49.930 --> 03:36:51.691]  The Polish want to be Polish.
[03:36:51.711 --> 03:36:53.491]  The Hungarians want to be Hungarians.
[03:36:53.811 --> 03:36:55.632]  The Italians want to be Italians.
[03:36:56.712 --> 03:36:58.253]  The Germans want to be Germans.
[03:36:58.273 --> 03:37:00.093]  The Austrians want to be Austrians.
[03:37:01.294 --> 03:37:04.575]  So they don't want any more people coming into their country.
[03:37:06.247 --> 03:37:14.109]  What caused the problem over there that you never hear coming out of the mouths of the prostitutes?
[03:37:15.889 --> 03:37:19.470]  Oh, and before Alex was talking about the hypocritical liberals.
[03:37:20.610 --> 03:37:26.031]  And again, it's both the liberals and the Democrats and the Republicans.
[03:37:26.691 --> 03:37:27.931]  How about wars?
[03:37:29.332 --> 03:37:30.452]  So where do you live?
[03:37:31.392 --> 03:37:32.672]  Joplin, Missouri?
[03:37:33.833 --> 03:37:35.093]  Orlando, Florida?
[03:37:37.025 --> 03:37:43.887]  Colonial Kingston, New York, and a foreign country comes in and obliterates where you live.
[03:37:44.847 --> 03:37:46.388]  Blows it to pieces.
[03:37:46.528 --> 03:37:49.529]  It's just smoke and dead bodies.
[03:37:50.909 --> 03:37:52.250]  You think you want to leave?
[03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:57.651]  You think you'd want to leave Iraq or Afghanistan?
[03:38:00.352 --> 03:38:01.973]  Syria or Libya?
[03:38:02.793 --> 03:38:03.293]  Of course.
[03:38:04.954 --> 03:38:06.214]  I'm going to follow up on that.
[03:38:07.659 --> 03:38:09.059]  Because there's another message.
[03:38:09.740 --> 03:38:22.303]  But before I do, I really want you to consider doing what you can to keep Alex Jones and InfoWars riding high.
[03:38:23.144 --> 03:38:32.667]  And one of the ways to do it is 50% off on all super blue products.
[03:38:33.987 --> 03:38:36.928]  Yep, the toothpaste, the mouthwash,
[03:38:38.413 --> 03:38:39.073]  The goggle.
[03:38:40.214 --> 03:38:44.995]  In that immune goggle, silver solve, silver wash, cleanse.
[03:38:45.795 --> 03:38:54.018]  All sizes, combos available for 50% off at InfoWarsStores.com.
[03:38:54.798 --> 03:38:55.378]  This is great.
[03:38:55.418 --> 03:38:58.779]  It's powerful, super blue, silver immune goggle.
[03:38:59.660 --> 03:39:00.421]  It's available.
[03:39:00.441 --> 03:39:02.362]  Again, 50% off together.
[03:39:02.382 --> 03:39:10.627]  You can stock up and take some to go for a portable and at home multipurpose purifying formula.
[03:39:11.367 --> 03:39:11.867]  It's great.
[03:39:12.448 --> 03:39:13.968]  And all of these products are.
[03:39:14.029 --> 03:39:19.472]  I use a number of them and I don't sell anything that I don't believe in.
[03:39:20.272 --> 03:39:25.015]  And so I promote this because I believe in what Alex Jones is doing in InfoWars.
[03:39:25.795 --> 03:39:28.417]  And again, it's freedom of speech in the
[03:39:29.119 --> 03:39:29.899]  Real way.
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:33.782]  And you have to support it to keep it going.
[03:39:35.002 --> 03:39:41.326]  So, going back to supporting it to keep it going, and what makes it happen, and hearing the real news.
[03:39:41.926 --> 03:39:47.209]  Remember that arrogant Nobel Peace of crap prize winner, Barack Obama?
[03:39:47.709 --> 03:39:48.169]  Folks?
[03:39:49.370 --> 03:39:49.630]  Yeah.
[03:39:50.823 --> 03:39:52.963]  I don't like that guy Qaddafi.
[03:39:53.063 --> 03:39:56.844]  He gotta go and I'm gonna make sure he doesn't stay.
[03:39:57.344 --> 03:39:59.045]  And Hillary Clinton laughing.
[03:39:59.505 --> 03:40:01.905]  We came, we saw, he died.
[03:40:01.925 --> 03:40:05.306]  Yeah, I wonder why Clinton lost the election.
[03:40:05.626 --> 03:40:07.246]  Can't figure it out.
[03:40:07.586 --> 03:40:08.546]  Well, anyway.
[03:40:10.307 --> 03:40:13.347]  So, who created the migrant crisis?
[03:40:15.548 --> 03:40:18.028]  Qaddafi warned all of Europe
[03:40:18.817 --> 03:40:29.808]  If I go, you're gonna get flooded with migrants because he was stopping them from leaving the shores of Tripoli and going into Italy.
[03:40:29.828 --> 03:40:33.772]  When they killed him, go back.
[03:40:33.932 --> 03:40:35.493]  The data is solid.
[03:40:35.513 --> 03:40:39.097]  We wrote about it in the Trends Journal in 2011 when this happened.
[03:40:41.156 --> 03:41:02.854]  Syria, again, the murderer Obama, quote, I'm really good at killing people, knocked off 4,000 with drone strikes, gave us a billion, took a billion dollars of our money and gave it to their moderate rebels over there in Syria to kill, what, about 600,000 people and destroy everything that's there?
[03:41:02.894 --> 03:41:04.015]  You think they want to leave?
[03:41:05.176 --> 03:41:09.380]  Again, murderer Bush and the rest of them with Afghanistan.
[03:41:10.475 --> 03:41:11.356]  And Pakistan.
[03:41:11.996 --> 03:41:14.377]  That's why you have the crisis in Europe.
[03:41:15.118 --> 03:41:16.518]  Here, it's a different story.
[03:41:17.339 --> 03:41:18.439]  And a different tale.
[03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:25.743]  They have a new guy running from... to run... the, uh, Mexico.
[03:41:26.984 --> 03:41:28.165]  López Obrador.
[03:41:29.906 --> 03:41:39.351]  And Obrador said yesterday, regarding the migrant crisis, very soon, with the triumph of our movement,
[03:41:40.049 --> 03:41:56.075]  We'll defend migrants from Mexico, Central America, and the whole continent, and all migrants from around the world who need to leave their towns to go and make their life in the U.S.
[03:41:58.976 --> 03:42:05.659]  Who is this guy to say what we should allow in here?
[03:42:08.627 --> 03:42:14.011]  It's a human right we are giving, we are going to defend.
[03:42:15.572 --> 03:42:16.412]  Stay home!
[03:42:17.713 --> 03:42:19.154]  Mind your own business!
[03:42:19.494 --> 03:42:22.016]  Get your countries back in order!
[03:42:22.677 --> 03:42:25.679]  Don't send the people here, you do it!
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:29.441]  We have our own problems.
[03:42:29.761 --> 03:42:35.005]  Who are you to say that they should be coming into our country?
[03:42:36.411 --> 03:42:38.571]  You get your own country in order.
[03:42:41.272 --> 03:42:42.732]  But no, this is it.
[03:42:42.752 --> 03:42:54.915]  And all the people that want migrants coming in, open up your house, open up your doors, feed them, pay for them, give them their health care, send them to school.
[03:42:55.915 --> 03:42:57.275]  Or else keep your mouth shut.
[03:42:58.476 --> 03:42:59.596]  We'll be back in a little bit.
[03:43:01.316 --> 03:43:01.756]  Now!
[03:43:03.757 --> 03:43:05.077]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:43:06.733 --> 03:43:08.813]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:43:09.093 --> 03:43:10.154]  I believe in you!
[03:43:10.594 --> 03:43:11.714]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:43:13.474 --> 03:43:16.375]  One man ever wrecks a woman!
[03:43:16.695 --> 03:43:18.315]  All genitals are cut off!
[03:43:18.555 --> 03:43:20.975]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:43:21.115 --> 03:43:22.336]  And we're not backing down on her!
[03:43:24.236 --> 03:43:25.396]  I want to kick these people!
[03:43:25.436 --> 03:43:25.956]  We're winning!
[03:43:26.016 --> 03:43:27.096]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:43:27.257 --> 03:43:27.737]  Can't you?
[03:43:28.017 --> 03:43:29.637]  We have broken their back!
[03:43:30.017 --> 03:43:31.177]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:43:35.018 --> 03:43:35.578]  Let's go!
[03:43:36.963 --> 03:43:37.103]  Come on!
[03:43:37.123 --> 03:43:37.363]  Come on!

[03:45:10.032 --> 03:45:10.332]  a lot.
[03:45:10.772 --> 03:45:11.693]  Banned off Twitter.
[03:45:12.834 --> 03:45:13.855]  They want her kicked off TV.
[03:45:13.995 --> 03:45:17.378]  Another reason I wanted to get her on is the assassination of Katie Hopkins.
[03:45:17.578 --> 03:45:24.424]  State-sponsored national theater opening in a Welsh area, and it's about killing her, and she's had an attempt on her life.
[03:45:24.524 --> 03:45:26.145]  So, this is next level.
[03:45:26.225 --> 03:45:31.249]  And they want you dead because you're powerful, you're vibrant, and I'm married, but I gotta say, you are pretty sexy.
[03:45:32.090 --> 03:45:47.088]  Well if you think I'm sexy I will say I think you need your eyes tested but I do think strong women are really fun to be around and the reason my government is sponsoring a play... Well that's what I'm saying look I don't think you look bad my point is it's attitudes what matters it's you have a light in your eyes you have
[03:45:47.668 --> 03:45:52.953]  I watched all these feminists that were at this feminist meeting with Hillary yesterday, and they look like they're zombies!
[03:45:53.153 --> 03:45:56.676]  It's not that they're even ugly, they look like something sucked their soul!
[03:45:56.856 --> 03:46:05.483]  The reason the state wants to run the play called the assassination of Katie Hopkins is because it would be much more convenient for them if that were true.
[03:46:05.943 --> 03:46:07.985]  One of the things the state loves is fear.
[03:46:08.205 --> 03:46:10.167]  They can control people when they're afraid.
[03:46:10.487 --> 03:46:16.612]  When you have someone like me who is not afraid of anyone, not the establishment, not the state, that's far more dangerous.
[03:46:17.012 --> 03:46:19.915]  And they would be much better for them if I wasn't around.
[03:46:19.935 --> 03:46:28.264]  So we had two jihadis sent down earlier this year because they had practiced beheading me with a dummy, with a plastic hunting, with a plastic dummy and a hunting knife.
[03:46:28.605 --> 03:46:30.707]  So the threat against my life is real.
[03:46:30.987 --> 03:46:33.550]  And now the state is sponsoring a play called exactly that.
[03:46:33.570 --> 03:46:37.715]  What would happen if I got a poster with the assassination of Sadiq Khan?
[03:46:38.175 --> 03:46:40.277]  Or the assassination of a black politician.
[03:46:40.497 --> 03:46:41.999]  How would that go down, do you think?
[03:46:42.059 --> 03:46:44.401]  Oh, it would be the biggest hissy fit the planet ever saw.
[03:46:44.561 --> 03:46:44.981]  Absolutely.
[03:46:45.001 --> 03:46:54.990]  I would be banned from everything within a moment because it's the assassination of a white, Christian, conservative woman who's passionate about her country and passionate about people's right to stand up for their country.
[03:46:55.410 --> 03:46:59.334]  It's seen as acceptable and, in fact, wildly amusing for the liberal elite.
[03:47:04.893 --> 03:47:07.675]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.216 --> 03:47:24.909]  You may be an ambassador to England or France
[03:47:33.536 --> 03:47:37.378]  You may be the heavyweight champion of the world.
[03:47:37.398 --> 03:47:38.818]  Hey, welcome back.
[03:47:38.858 --> 03:47:39.598]  Welcome back.
[03:47:40.259 --> 03:47:43.320]  And remember, put your money where your mind is.
[03:47:43.380 --> 03:47:46.321]  Keep InfoWars alive and moving and growing.
[03:47:47.061 --> 03:47:55.225]  And support Alex Jones and all the staff that do the best they can to bring you what you can't get anywhere else when it comes to news.
[03:47:56.025 --> 03:47:58.546]  Of course, if you want trends news, that's a different story.
[03:47:58.566 --> 03:47:59.006]  But anyway.
[03:47:59.026 --> 03:48:02.888]  I was talking about the migrant crisis.
[03:48:04.567 --> 03:48:13.872]  And how this is going to be the major issue worldwide for quite a while.
[03:48:15.132 --> 03:48:16.893]  You look at population numbers.
[03:48:18.734 --> 03:48:22.396]  If you went back to 1900, that's not ancient history.
[03:48:22.416 --> 03:48:27.799]  There were about 1.5 billion people on the planet around then.
[03:48:27.819 --> 03:48:30.360]  And now what do we have?
[03:48:31.437 --> 03:48:34.318]  What are we at, about six billion since then?
[03:48:35.458 --> 03:48:42.680]  So, it's really self-sustaining economies that really have to make it happen.
[03:48:42.780 --> 03:48:55.343]  And people that are having children to understand, if you can't support yourself, and if you're living in a dangerous area, why would you bring anybody into that kind of situation?
[03:48:56.443 --> 03:48:57.823]  Just a question to ask.
[03:48:59.524 --> 03:49:00.584]  But the United States,
[03:49:02.091 --> 03:49:06.572]  And Europe are not prepared to take in more people.
[03:49:07.412 --> 03:49:23.415]  When you look at the unemployment rates, particularly in Europe, in Italy, rather, and Greece, and Spain, of young adults, you're looking in 30% ranges, and now you're going to bring more people in?
[03:49:25.235 --> 03:49:31.376]  And when you bring more people in, and they take more jobs, your wages get lower, supply and demand,
[03:49:33.277 --> 03:49:37.318]  So, moving on to some other trend issues of importance.
[03:49:39.059 --> 03:49:41.260]  Of course, the markets are down as we speak.
[03:49:42.640 --> 03:49:43.881]  Over 400 points.
[03:49:45.541 --> 03:49:48.302]  As you well know, I was the first to call the Trump rally.
[03:49:49.422 --> 03:49:51.023]  Just weeks after he got elected.
[03:49:51.043 --> 03:49:52.964]  And I've been on Alex Jones a lot of years.
[03:49:53.604 --> 03:49:56.905]  And you know when I'm negative on the economy and positive on the economy.
[03:49:58.460 --> 03:50:03.503]  And as all my colleagues in the same field of mine kept saying it would go down, I kept saying it would go up.
[03:50:04.644 --> 03:50:11.908]  And then in the Trends Journal in December, we said the Trump rally will peak in 2018, and it'll hit a correction, and it did.
[03:50:13.649 --> 03:50:17.171]  So, basically, the stocks are overvalued and overleveraged.
[03:50:18.652 --> 03:50:20.433]  We don't see a trade war coming.
[03:50:22.174 --> 03:50:23.916]  China has a $385 billion trade surplus with us.
[03:50:24.056 --> 03:50:24.396]  Mexico?
[03:50:29.443 --> 03:50:29.963]  71 billion.
[03:50:29.983 --> 03:50:32.524]  They're making more money than us in those numbers.
[03:50:33.184 --> 03:50:34.704]  There's going to be a negotiation.
[03:50:35.064 --> 03:50:38.325]  It's the art of the deal, to quote Trump.
[03:50:39.265 --> 03:50:42.705]  And so as we're hearing about all this, the market's fluctuating.
[03:50:43.245 --> 03:50:47.286]  There are market fundamentals that are driving down overvalued stocks.
[03:50:47.886 --> 03:50:58.008]  And another big one to look at, if the markets are really in trouble today, as I see it as a trend forecaster, and I don't give financial advice,
[03:50:59.178 --> 03:51:01.960]  Gold prices would be shooting through the roof.
[03:51:04.523 --> 03:51:05.503]  Day is flat.
[03:51:07.125 --> 03:51:08.246]  And they're on a down hit.
[03:51:09.327 --> 03:51:10.728]  Can't stay over that $1,300 mark.
[03:51:10.828 --> 03:51:14.892]  And you've heard me now for the last five years.
[03:51:14.972 --> 03:51:16.253]  Sound like a broken record?
[03:51:17.173 --> 03:51:22.378]  Gold has to go over $1,475 to break out.
[03:51:22.718 --> 03:51:25.060]  $1,450, excuse me, for the breakout point.
[03:51:25.501 --> 03:51:26.862]  Hasn't done that in five years.
[03:51:27.901 --> 03:51:32.023]  The downside risk we see of gold is around $1,200 an ounce.
[03:51:32.844 --> 03:51:35.145]  So your downside risk is very small.
[03:51:36.125 --> 03:51:37.826]  Again, I'm not giving financial advice.
[03:51:37.906 --> 03:51:38.987]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:51:40.447 --> 03:51:48.912]  I say $1,200 an ounce because would you make something that costs you more than you can sell it for?
[03:51:50.773 --> 03:51:55.595]  And that's what gold is at $1,200 an ounce.
[03:51:56.236 --> 03:51:57.116]  That's what it costs
[03:51:57.739 --> 03:51:59.800]  We extract it from the ground.
[03:52:00.780 --> 03:52:03.521]  So, those are some trend insights.
[03:52:03.661 --> 03:52:15.784]  And some other insights are introducing ExtendoWise from InfoWars Life, an introductory 35% off sale.
[03:52:16.664 --> 03:52:25.727]  ExtendoWise is a heart health soft gel supplement in a 60-day supply that contains CLQ10,
[03:52:27.390 --> 03:52:36.776]  EPA and garlic extract that focus on providing you with long-term heart, cardiovascular and blood vessel support.
[03:52:38.197 --> 03:52:54.967]  Just one of InfoWars soft gels, just one of these soft gels every day provides as much EPA as 3.6 ounces of salmon and as much COQ10
[03:52:56.534 --> 03:53:01.357]  As five pounds of beef or pork, not all.
[03:53:02.217 --> 03:53:13.423]  And studies have shown that as you age, which I'm doing, your levels of the incredible COQ10 antioxidant decrease.
[03:53:13.543 --> 03:53:23.008]  So to keep up with your body's needs, ExtenderWise was made to support your heart health and energy production.
[03:53:23.028 --> 03:53:25.349]  So there you got it.
[03:53:26.158 --> 03:53:27.479]  You know, you talk about more garlic.
[03:53:27.519 --> 03:53:28.099]  I don't have that.
[03:53:28.139 --> 03:53:29.260]  That's one thing I don't need.
[03:53:29.681 --> 03:53:30.942]  I use garlic all the time.
[03:53:31.302 --> 03:53:34.284]  I live on garlic and olive oil and pasta.
[03:53:34.684 --> 03:53:35.585]  I love to cook.
[03:53:36.606 --> 03:53:43.111]  Anyway, moving on and staying on the economy in sorts, as we're talking about the markets.
[03:53:44.872 --> 03:53:46.233]  Gold is a key indicator.
[03:53:46.273 --> 03:53:48.134]  But here's something very important to watch.
[03:53:49.615 --> 03:53:51.697]  Watch what's going on in the emerging markets.
[03:53:52.344 --> 03:54:01.310]  And again, to read past the headlines and not get sold by them, Beijing eases capital reserve rules to soften impact of U.S.
[03:54:01.350 --> 03:54:01.850]  trade war.
[03:54:01.890 --> 03:54:04.532]  Financial Times, top story.
[03:54:04.572 --> 03:54:09.716]  That's not why they're easing capital reserve rules.
[03:54:10.376 --> 03:54:14.479]  The reason they're doing it is because the Chinese economy is not doing well.
[03:54:15.239 --> 03:54:19.242]  You're looking at some data coming out of China, it's back to 22-year lows.
[03:54:21.525 --> 03:54:22.285]  Investment.
[03:54:23.186 --> 03:54:24.587]  They have real problems.
[03:54:25.908 --> 03:54:28.309]  They have a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 300.
[03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:33.752]  The United States is hovering around 100.
[03:54:34.252 --> 03:54:40.036]  Their debt, 22 years ago, total, was about $500 billion.
[03:54:40.476 --> 03:54:43.498]  Today, $30 trillion.
[03:54:45.679 --> 03:54:50.742]  If you're interested in where the economies are going, and by the way, there's a global slowdown.
[03:54:52.196 --> 03:54:55.557]  If you look, I read these numbers all the time coming out of Germany with Europe.
[03:54:57.098 --> 03:54:59.059]  China is a slowdown.
[03:55:00.239 --> 03:55:01.000]  Here's the deal.
[03:55:01.540 --> 03:55:07.202]  As the dollar gets stronger, because they're raising interest rates, that's why you're seeing gold prices go down.
[03:55:08.183 --> 03:55:10.384]  Because gold doesn't pay any interest.
[03:55:11.364 --> 03:55:12.985]  There's an opportunity cost to hold it.
[03:55:13.565 --> 03:55:20.468]  But all that money that was borrowed by those emerging markets, when the dollar was cheap, their currencies are going down.
[03:55:21.209 --> 03:55:28.470]  They've got to pay back that debt with more of their money as it's being devalued.
[03:55:29.371 --> 03:55:31.471]  Watch what's going on in the emerging markets.
[03:55:31.831 --> 03:55:46.394]  Going back to the stock markets, all this merger and acquisition activity, AT&T, this one, that one, the mountains of debt that they are acquiring to do these deals, they have to pay it back.
[03:55:47.014 --> 03:55:47.174]  Huh.
[03:55:47.194 --> 03:55:50.375]  How are they going to pay it back?
[03:55:51.035 --> 03:55:59.621]  When interest rates go up, and they have to pay it back with more money, and they're not making that kind of profit, huh?
[03:56:00.242 --> 03:56:03.144]  Like a Toys R Us or a Toys R Goodbye.
[03:56:03.164 --> 03:56:12.411]  So this is why you're seeing market reaction, as we view it, has very little to do with tariffs and trade.
[03:56:13.152 --> 03:56:18.536]  There's going to be back and forths on this, and there should be, unless
[03:56:19.713 --> 03:56:33.744]  You're at a different camp, and you like buying cheap so you can sell out America, rather than paying a little bit more for American quality made in USA.
[03:56:34.905 --> 03:56:36.707]  And to me, that's the answer.
[03:56:37.607 --> 03:56:48.316]  Everything that we could manufacture here, that is of the quality that we demand, made in America, self-sustaining economy.
[03:56:49.281 --> 03:57:00.084]  You boost the economy, and then when you do, then you can start bringing in other people to create more jobs and build the country.
[03:57:00.724 --> 03:57:04.725]  But right now, look at this infrastructure.
[03:57:05.525 --> 03:57:08.586]  I go on the subways in New York, it's like a night in Calcutta.
[03:57:09.406 --> 03:57:15.648]  But hey, look at those subways and rail lines they're building in Pakistan.
[03:57:16.713 --> 03:57:17.754]  Much better than ours.
[03:57:17.814 --> 03:57:18.535]  And who's doing it?
[03:57:18.975 --> 03:57:19.836]  The Chinese.
[03:57:20.876 --> 03:57:22.858]  Because the business of China is business.
[03:57:22.878 --> 03:57:24.099]  They're only interested in making money.
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:28.843]  If America's business keeps being war, that's not going to be so good.
[03:57:29.924 --> 03:57:31.745]  So we need to go into a different direction.
[03:57:32.786 --> 03:57:35.108]  And to me, it's a self-sustaining economy.
[03:57:36.329 --> 03:57:42.134]  Buy America, and buy what Alex Jones gets made in America.
[03:57:42.974 --> 03:57:46.037]  Products that will keep you healthy, keep you alert,
[03:57:46.906 --> 03:57:50.151]  I'll keep you young, and most of all, keep you alive.

[03:58:07.842 --> 03:58:19.107]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[03:58:19.747 --> 03:58:30.489]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
