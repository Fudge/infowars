[00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:07.015]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:08.296]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:09.957]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:12.179]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.581]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:18.825]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:37.676]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're only 41 days out from this incredibly important historical election.
[00:00:38.417 --> 00:00:41.680]  We have a jam-packed global broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.343]  I want to thank you all for joining us.
[00:00:44.403 --> 00:00:48.428]  Remember, this is the most demonized, most lied about, most attacked
[00:00:48.928 --> 00:01:01.158]  Broadcast in the world by multinational globalist corporations, by the Communist Chinese, by the Hollywood pedophile scum, and by Democrat control freaks and criminal networks across the United States.
[00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:02.659]  And for good reason.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.341]  They hate your guts.
[00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:05.722]  They hate America.
[00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:07.563]  They hate flyover country.
[00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:08.865]  They hate hard-working people.
[00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:12.379]  And they want to use divide and conquer to control us.
[00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:20.563]  And they see InfoWars as a manifestation of the spirit of human resistance against their evil.
[00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:29.587]  And they want to extinguish the American spirit and the Renaissance spirit and the true spirit of Christ in this country.
[00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:33.689]  And they know that our spirit and our will is strong.
[00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.711]  And they know that InfoWars is a serious focal point.
[00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:54.603]  Of that resistance, and so they are amassing everything they can to try to destroy Infowars and destroy President Trump to destroy any type of organization or kinship that we have together to understand we have solidarity.
[00:01:55.204 --> 00:02:08.755]  That comes out in their internal emails, it comes out in their WikiLeaks, it came out in a new video yesterday of one of the main operatives for Twitter that always has his tweets put right up there with Trump's artificially, how we're there to sow the division.
[00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:11.998]  We're there to sow the discord.
[00:02:12.678 --> 00:02:13.679]  That is their plan.
[00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.140]  Sabotage.
[00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:16.441]  And guess what?
[00:02:18.122 --> 00:02:22.666]  Interest rates have been raised six times since Trump got in 20 months ago.
[00:02:24.753 --> 00:02:27.435]  They were never raved when Obama was in for eight years.
[00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:39.344]  And the Federal Reserve has come out, there's an article in Reuters, saying Fed to lift rates possibly to end accommodative policy era to a good economy.
[00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:43.127]  That translates to stop the recovery and stop Trump.
[00:02:43.668 --> 00:02:46.010]  So that's the scientific way of saying it.
[00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.615]  What good old Bill Maher said about how he wants people to basically be homeless in a depression.
[00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.295]  Show that people learn to hate Trump.
[00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.416]  So, sabotage it is.
[00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.759]  And that's exactly who these lawless individuals are.
[00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.760]  So now it's up to us to expose this.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.881]  The President must take over the private Federal Reserve.
[00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:10.924]  Only the President can do it through executive action the way the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was set up.
[00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:14.566]  Only the president could do that immediately.
[00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:25.199]  You could repeal the Federal Reserve Act, but that would take a constitutional convention, because the Federal Reserve Act was put in through that system.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.001]  There's some other ways as well.
[00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.441]  It's unbelievable to see the whole power structure against this country.
[00:03:32.142 --> 00:03:37.266]  And six interest rate hikes, and they still cannot suppress the recovery.
[00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:43.270]  They know it's going past 4.8% growth, and they just don't know what to do.
[00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.753]  They're so desperate to keep you demoralized.
[00:03:46.773 --> 00:03:48.154]  They're so desperate to sabotage you.
[00:03:48.234 --> 00:03:49.475]  It's just simply amazing.
[00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:53.558]  So when we come back from break, of course, right on time.
[00:03:53.938 --> 00:03:56.340]  I predicted this last Tuesday, eight days ago.
[00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:06.056]  That there would be three more accusers, at least, and they would dole them out starting on the weekend before the vote, right up to the day of the vote, and now right on time.
[00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:19.026]  Another woman says that in high school she witnessed Kavanaugh and Mr. Judge, his friend, pulling Amtraks on girls, pulling the train.
[00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:26.653]  So I guess they've been listening to too much Too Short, or too much Too Live Crew.
[00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:29.766]  But, uh, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:40.573]  Of course, everybody that knows Kavanaugh said he was a total nerd and would just study 20 hours a day and didn't even have girlfriends, but his buddy Judge did, so now they're gonna tie him into all this.
[00:04:40.853 --> 00:04:44.235]  They said there was hunch there to get the girls drunk and rape them.
[00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:45.356]  Yes!
[00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:47.137]  What's next?
[00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:49.118]  Kavanaugh sacrificed children?
[00:04:49.438 --> 00:04:50.399]  He drank their blood?
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:04.243]  Just a month ago, that Nazi collaborator, anti-American, gun-grabbing, anti-Christian piece of filth, George Soros, bought an even bigger interest in PayPal.
[00:05:05.364 --> 00:05:10.466]  But sure enough, they just told us today that we're going to be banned in 10 days because we're hateful.
[00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:13.907]  Because we don't support radical Islam and open borders and the rest of it.
[00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:20.782]  Ladies and gentlemen, now more than ever, you supporting InfoWars is changing the world.
[00:05:21.703 --> 00:05:25.085]  And yeah, they're getting rid of PayPal, but we have other ways to process your credit cards.
[00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:31.648]  Your financial support of us is literally buying war bonds in a 21st century war for humanity.
[00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:32.949]  So I want to commend you.
[00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:33.990]  I want to thank you.
[00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.651]  We've got great products you already need.
[00:05:37.028 --> 00:05:38.649]  But without you, they will win.
[00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:46.731]  And Soros and Obama and Hillary see the shutdown of InfoWars as a referendum on breaking the American spirit.
[00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:48.872]  So let's not let these jerks do it.
[00:05:49.252 --> 00:05:51.253]  I'm committed to the end, but I want to win.
[00:05:51.573 --> 00:05:54.194]  So please support InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:06:01.813 --> 00:06:10.483]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.792]  Well, it kicked off at 8 a.m.
[00:06:17.892 --> 00:06:18.492]  this morning.
[00:06:19.907 --> 00:06:28.075]  And it's the Stand With Trump, Stand With Infowars, Stand With Free Speech, Stand With America Against The Globalist special broadcast.
[00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:29.957]  We're going for 16 hours today.
[00:06:30.538 --> 00:06:33.641]  We're normally here 10 hours a day with live broadcasts, 8 a.m.
[00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:34.642]  to 6 p.m.
[00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:36.223]  We have a lot of other special transmissions.
[00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:42.149]  But today, going out on all the satellites and the radio stations and everybody, we're going to be going until midnight.
[00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.811]  We've got a whole raft of special guests.
[00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:48.892]  I'll give you the schedule coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:51.273]  We're going to post that up on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:56.495]  Stan with Trump, InfoWars all-day broadcast in support of saving the country.
[00:06:57.215 --> 00:07:03.417]  The Federal Reserve has come out and announced they're going to raise interest rates until the recovery stops.
[00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:07.397]  They say the economy's overheating.
[00:07:07.457 --> 00:07:09.358]  That means you might be able to pay off some of your debts.
[00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:11.480]  You might be able to pay off some of the national debt.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.984]  The growth of the debt for the first time started to slow, and they just cannot have that.
[00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:30.636]  So they didn't raise interest rates under Obama, but they are now raising it six times, and they say they'll do it to end the, quote, accommodative policy era where they tried to stimulate the economy.
[00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:44.411]  But of course the policies of Obama, high regulations, only giving the 0% interest to big mega banks and large corporations, that was not meant to stimulate the general economy, but to vertically integrate it.
[00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:59.676]  Now, under Trump, he's gotten some of the policies changed where you're seeing record loans to small businesses, record small business startups, and that's why you're already seeing record profits in just 20 months in small businesses.
[00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:01.778]  That is a big, big deal.
[00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:06.281]  Very, very serious situation that China
[00:08:07.267 --> 00:08:20.751]  Trump has had basically zero interest rates for their companies for decades, but we can't have that anymore because Obama is out of office and Trump is in office now and so we can't let America have a recovery.
[00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:24.292]  We can't show you what good old-fashioned Americana policies do.
[00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:28.073]  Look, the economists all know what works.
[00:08:28.873 --> 00:08:31.054]  Trump is doing what JFK did.
[00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:33.312]  The same policies.
[00:08:33.572 --> 00:08:34.953]  The Democrats used to have these policies.
[00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:40.777]  But it empowers the little guy and they don't like that one bit.
[00:08:41.838 --> 00:08:44.219]  Now, let me give you a boil down of what's coming up.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.984]  We've got some of the amazing clips of Trump at the UN, obviously, basically calling globalism out.
[00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:58.530]  We also have Trump exposing the entire Kavanaugh situation as a total fraud and a con job and a hoax.
[00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.552]  We're going to go to that first here in just a moment.
[00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.731]  We're going to look at the latest Kavanaugh accuser.
[00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:07.933]  When I'm on target, I'm on target.
[00:09:08.013 --> 00:09:23.083]  Did I not say last Tuesday, and the videos at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, if you want to go pull it up or just go to Reel.video, and it's there as well, Alex Jones predicts Democrats are going to roll out three more female accusers.
[00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:29.011]  Now we have the third accuser right on time.
[00:09:29.392 --> 00:09:30.433]  This is such a snowball.
[00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:32.435]  Hell, I might be wrong.
[00:09:32.475 --> 00:09:39.883]  You might have 150 by Friday with the vote that Senator Grassley has scheduled.
[00:09:39.903 --> 00:09:46.130]  I mean, there may be women coming out saying that they saw Brett Kavanaugh literally
[00:09:48.612 --> 00:09:52.333]  Put suicide vest on children and have them march in and blow up churches.
[00:09:52.413 --> 00:09:53.513]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's Islam.
[00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:54.513]  So we can't talk about it.
[00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:57.994]  I mean, they may say they saw Kavanaugh sexually mutilate newborn girls.
[00:09:58.074 --> 00:09:59.374]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's radical Islam again.
[00:09:59.754 --> 00:10:04.875]  They may say they saw Kavanaugh at spirit cooking events, drinking blood, and worshipping Alistair Crowley.
[00:10:04.996 --> 00:10:05.516]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:10:05.636 --> 00:10:07.636]  That's John Podesta and the Democrats.
[00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:15.978]  Hell, they may say Kavanaugh was a lawyer that represented hardcore child rapists, and that Kavanaugh bragged as a lawyer that he
[00:10:17.728 --> 00:10:25.533]  Had helped cover it up, knowing the child rapist were guilty, including seven men that raped an 11-year-old girl until her cervix was smashed.
[00:10:25.934 --> 00:10:27.715]  I'm sorry, that was Hillary!
[00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:42.104]  We may learn that Kavanaugh flew on a jumbo jet 29 times without the Secret Service, with a convicted pedophile that was videotaping world leaders having sex with little girls to blackmail them for Robert Mueller.
[00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:44.546]  I'm sorry, that was Bill Clinton again.
[00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:50.357]  But see, none of those confirmed things matter.
[00:10:50.657 --> 00:10:55.819]  It's all these 36-year-old, no corroboration, all the stories fall apart.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.761]  That's what we should be talking about.
[00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:06.502]  Not Hillary saying she came, she saw Gaddafi died, and hundreds of thousands died, including little girls, but the sex slavery.
[00:11:07.603 --> 00:11:08.683]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:08.743 --> 00:11:14.005]  It's the moral Democrats, the ones that want to sexualize your children through Hollywood.
[00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:37.197]  They're the ones that want to stop the evil first in his class in college, first in his class in so many ways, and known as a total nerd, who was a virgin until his last year of college, according to all these witnesses and everyone that knows him on record and his own calendars showing that none of this is true, and his house and his buddy's house wasn't where she said it was.
[00:11:37.517 --> 00:11:38.377]  It doesn't matter!
[00:11:39.358 --> 00:11:43.480]  Because Antovedi, a truly ferret-like man,
[00:11:45.057 --> 00:11:46.418]  A true scumbag.
[00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:50.760]  He says it's true.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.962]  So that is the end of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:55.723 --> 00:12:07.249]  He says this latest woman is courageous and brave and just amazing and all the feminist dog whistles that are totally fake of the women kept in slavery by the Democratic Party.
[00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:14.251]  Why did she go to parties where she said they ran trains on girls?
[00:12:15.132 --> 00:12:16.472]  Gang, gang, gang bangs.
[00:12:18.673 --> 00:12:19.714]  Now she calls it rape.
[00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:23.656]  But she never called the police or told anybody.
[00:12:24.136 --> 00:12:30.220]  And then she said she didn't like the parties because of the punch, so she wouldn't drink it, but still she went back a whole bunch and then she got raped.
[00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:35.524]  Now I'll tell you, I was at high school parties and stuff where people got drunk.
[00:12:36.344 --> 00:12:41.468]  And I was never around spiking things with drugs, but everybody knew that was ever clear on the punch.
[00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.694]  Most of the times I went to those things, I wish I wouldn't have gone to them because I didn't end up, you know, face down in a hallway or something.
[00:12:48.794 --> 00:12:52.417]  There wasn't a lot of sex happening because people just got drunk and threw up all over the place.
[00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.339]  But that's not the kind of guy Kavanaugh was.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.782]  I've always admitted it, that I partied quite a bit.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.941]  Not into drugs, but alcohol was flowing freely.
[00:13:04.282 --> 00:13:08.404]  And there was vomiting going on, not sex.
[00:13:09.384 --> 00:13:10.304]  At least those kind of parties.
[00:13:10.705 --> 00:13:12.866]  I mean, I did have girlfriends, and I was promiscuous.
[00:13:13.206 --> 00:13:16.387]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing, but it was all consensual.
[00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:22.970]  This idea, though, that, oh, there were parties and there was drinking, and then there's no witnesses of him ever at any of these parties.
[00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:23.490]  It's crazy.
[00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:25.431]  And the president knocks it out of the park.
[00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:28.793]  This is a giant con game.
[00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:33.733]  This whole thing has giant holes in it.
[00:13:34.935 --> 00:13:42.504]  And it's all the 11th hour, 58 minute, this all gets rolled out now, not eight weeks ago when Kavanaugh first got announced.
[00:13:42.684 --> 00:13:43.405]  Let's go to the president.
[00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.532]  In less than two years...
[00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:51.651]  Give us some thoughts, sir.
[00:13:52.072 --> 00:13:54.072]  I think he's just a wonderful human being.
[00:13:54.152 --> 00:13:57.013]  I mean, I think it's horrible what the Democrats have done.
[00:13:57.293 --> 00:13:58.914]  It's a con game they're playing.
[00:13:58.954 --> 00:14:00.195]  They're really con artists.
[00:14:00.595 --> 00:14:05.457]  They're trying to convince... You know, they don't believe it themselves, okay?
[00:14:06.017 --> 00:14:07.637]  They know he's a high-quality person.
[00:14:08.058 --> 00:14:09.398]  They don't believe him.
[00:14:09.458 --> 00:14:11.799]  It's just resist and obstruct.
[00:14:12.773 --> 00:14:14.054]  They're playing a con game.
[00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:15.956]  And they play it very well.
[00:14:15.996 --> 00:14:18.237]  They play it actually much better than the Republicans.
[00:14:18.618 --> 00:14:21.080]  They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.261]  They don't know what the hell they're doing.
[00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:23.241]  They want to get rid of ICE.
[00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:26.884]  They want to get rid of law enforcement.
[00:14:26.904 --> 00:14:28.546]  They don't want to take care of our military.
[00:14:29.066 --> 00:14:30.387]  They want to raise your taxes.
[00:14:31.468 --> 00:14:32.569]  But they're good at one thing.
[00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.990]  They're good at one thing.
[00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.312]  That's obstruction and resisting and con.
[00:14:39.194 --> 00:14:41.296]  And then he goes on to talk about
[00:14:43.328 --> 00:14:44.629]  How they know they're lying.
[00:14:44.809 --> 00:14:46.009]  Schumer knows they're lying.
[00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.191]  When we come back, I'm going to play the whole clip.
[00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:56.714]  But we're also then going to get into, as I said, Trump going to the UN and being laughed at.
[00:14:57.615 --> 00:15:00.116]  But I've watched the video several times and listened to it.
[00:15:00.196 --> 00:15:01.877]  Most of it sounds like good humor.
[00:15:03.109 --> 00:15:08.170]  So I don't think this is like him being laughed at at the Correspondents' Dinner or other places.
[00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.091]  But that said, so what?
[00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:12.711]  The man in the arena gets laughed at.
[00:15:13.232 --> 00:15:15.172]  The man changing the world gets laughed at.
[00:15:15.812 --> 00:15:21.894]  So I have some very important things that we're going to be saying about this when we come back on the other side.
[00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:22.614]  Please remember,
[00:15:23.334 --> 00:15:24.455]  They're trying to censor us.
[00:15:24.495 --> 00:15:25.556]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:15:25.876 --> 00:15:30.039]  The entire power structure is obsessed with people not tuning into this broadcast.
[00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:37.764]  That's why, whether you're listening on local TV stations, watching on cable stations, radio stations, you've got to spread the word aggressively.
[00:15:37.784 --> 00:15:38.284]  And thank you.
[00:15:38.324 --> 00:15:38.985]  You've been doing it.
[00:15:39.325 --> 00:15:42.487]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com are really making a difference.
[00:15:42.747 --> 00:15:45.629]  They're trying to silence Americans, these globalists, ahead of the elections.
[00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:46.590]  And we're not going to let them.
[00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.670]  You're not going to let them.
[00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:49.912]  And so you've certainly joined the fight.
[00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:50.912]  You've risen to the challenge.
[00:15:51.253 --> 00:15:53.234]  And I want to thank the listeners and viewers for the great job they're doing.
[00:15:56.815 --> 00:15:57.835]  He's The Amazing Lucas.
[00:15:58.055 --> 00:16:00.756]  Every one of his videos is really good, really informative.
[00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:04.837]  And he's a champion bodybuilder and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:10.319]  And he's The Amazing Lucas on Instagram, at I'm The Amazing Lucas, YouTube The Amazing Lucas.
[00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:15.100]  And he just got involved in the last year or so because of all the stuff that he has seen.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.240]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.841]  Thank you for having me.
[00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:21.402]  Man, I tell you, what would you call the state of the nation
[00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:23.006]  Right now.
[00:16:23.026 --> 00:16:24.727]  What would you call that?
[00:16:25.187 --> 00:16:25.807]  A hysterical.
[00:16:26.067 --> 00:16:27.067]  And it's manufactured.
[00:16:27.407 --> 00:16:27.947]  Hysteria.
[00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:29.328]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:16:30.008 --> 00:16:32.689]  Because everything from Maxine Waters, like, that's real.
[00:16:33.109 --> 00:16:36.650]  When it comes to the mob, the thing is, many people were focusing on what she was saying.
[00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.751]  But if you really go back in time, they've always been saying some off-the-wall things.
[00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:43.852]  The only difference is, now people are cheering.
[00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:49.053]  And once you have Tommy Loring and water thrown in your face, it's only a matter of time that water becomes acid.
[00:16:49.653 --> 00:16:50.454]  When do they stop her?
[00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:51.255]  How far does this go?
[00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:52.156]  They won't stop.
[00:16:52.497 --> 00:16:53.278]  They absolutely won't stop.
[00:16:53.298 --> 00:16:57.623]  Because what they won't allow to happen is a repeat of what happened in 2016.
[00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.846]  And I don't think a lot of people understand that.
[00:16:59.906 --> 00:17:03.010]  What we're seeing is just, it's the tipping point.
[00:17:03.511 --> 00:17:08.517]  And while they're figuring out and re-strategizing right now, this is a time that we need to consolidate.
[00:17:09.392 --> 00:17:09.852]  I think
[00:17:29.229 --> 00:17:31.330]  To steal the American dream, it's so cold-blooded.
[00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.231]  It absolutely is.
[00:17:32.311 --> 00:17:35.052]  The thing is, what the left touches, they destroy.
[00:17:35.112 --> 00:17:46.338]  And for people who don't believe that, you can look at the black community, everything from separating fathers with the welfare, to putting Planned Parenthoods in the communities, to presently right now, seeing voter IDs, it's racist, it's racist.
[00:17:46.418 --> 00:17:48.139]  It's like, we all know that's not the case.
[00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:49.600]  You want the votes from the legals.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:55.463]  But what the frightening part is, what should be alarming to people right now, is that they have their eyes on America.
[00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:57.504]  That should be the frightening part, because guess what?
[00:17:57.584 --> 00:17:58.985]  That affects you, that affects me.
[00:17:59.025 --> 00:18:00.306]  To me, that affects everyone.
[00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:02.769]  And that's why you need to pick up and fight.
[00:18:02.829 --> 00:18:04.952]  And I'm not saying incite the violence, but you need to fight.
[00:18:05.312 --> 00:18:08.576]  And, you know, no pun intended, but it is an information war.
[00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:09.477]  And it's true!
[00:18:09.577 --> 00:18:12.881]  I mean, what you said is everything they touch turns to crap.
[00:18:13.001 --> 00:18:15.984]  Why in the world would we want these people running things?
[00:18:16.024 --> 00:18:20.149]  TheAmazingLucas, at IamTheAmazingLucas on Twitter, be sure to follow him.
[00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:26.082]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years.
[00:18:26.142 --> 00:18:28.744]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:34.448]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:42.813]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[00:18:43.153 --> 00:18:48.096]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[00:18:48.637 --> 00:18:50.398]  Right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:50.418 --> 00:18:51.919]  Please support this network.
[00:18:53.539 --> 00:19:00.807]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:19:01.187 --> 00:19:08.695]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:19:09.095 --> 00:19:12.199]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:17.101]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:19:17.462 --> 00:19:21.384]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:24.325]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:28.928]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:19:29.488 --> 00:19:32.510]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:47.799]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:49.340]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.681]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you
[00:19:57.142 --> 00:19:59.745]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:47.977]  I think.
[00:20:55.908 --> 00:20:57.069]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.490]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:12.302]  Michael Graves, former lead singer of the Misfits, banned from major music festival in England for tweeting Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson articles and videos, will be joining us to talk about the total war on free speech and where he thinks it's going.
[00:21:12.722 --> 00:21:12.962]  I don't know.
[00:21:28.832 --> 00:21:41.661]  We're going to be looking at that and we also have Vox Dei joining us, Roger Stone and so much more right through the big list of guests that we have that I will tell you about at the start of the next segment.
[00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:43.823]  So please print me that list guys so I have that.
[00:21:43.863 --> 00:21:44.223]  Thank you.
[00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:47.145]  It's also listed up on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:50.928]  Now I'm going to get to a boil down here in a moment of
[00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:58.369]  People laughing at the president in the past and in the present, and laughing at others like Nigel Farage.
[00:21:58.429 --> 00:22:01.311]  So it's good to be laughed at and then laughed last.
[00:22:01.671 --> 00:22:11.739]  But first I want to play a clip from a Michelle Obama speech that's linked up on DrudgeReport.com right now, the full speech, where she just says some unbelievable things.
[00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:17.323]  She encourages people who quote, know nothing about nothing to vote.
[00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:18.784]  I'm not kidding, here it is.
[00:22:19.648 --> 00:22:23.131]  Voting does not require any kind of special expertise.
[00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:28.815]  You don't need to have some fancy degree to be qualified to vote.
[00:22:29.795 --> 00:22:33.178]  You don't have to read every news article to be qualified to vote.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.421]  You know what you need to be qualified to vote?
[00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:38.142]  You need to be a citizen.
[00:22:39.242 --> 00:22:39.642]  You know?
[00:22:40.162 --> 00:22:41.923]  You need to be a part of this country.
[00:22:42.603 --> 00:22:46.205]  You need to have opinions about the issues in your community.
[00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:47.826]  That's what qualifies you to vote.
[00:22:47.886 --> 00:22:51.807]  Caring about your kid's future qualifies you to be a voter.
[00:22:53.048 --> 00:22:57.490]  Wanting a say in what happens in this country qualifies you to be a voter.
[00:23:00.638 --> 00:23:01.799]  So don't be intimidated.
[00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:05.720]  Don't let somebody intimidate you from being a part of this process.
[00:23:06.421 --> 00:23:08.822]  I've been voting since I was 18 years old.
[00:23:09.922 --> 00:23:14.044]  And trust me, I didn't know nothing about nothing at 18 years old.
[00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:16.425]  But you're still out of control of slaves now, don't you?
[00:23:16.805 --> 00:23:19.706]  The big megabanks and the chi-coms, the biggest slave masters on earth.
[00:23:20.167 --> 00:23:22.248]  Oh, we're intimidating you from voting.
[00:23:22.508 --> 00:23:22.928]  Bull!
[00:23:23.428 --> 00:23:25.209]  The Democrats out intimidating everybody.
[00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:28.550]  Here is President Trump at the United Nations yesterday.
[00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.671]  I think more
[00:23:30.231 --> 00:23:32.433]  One year ago I stood before you for the first time in this grand hall.
[00:23:32.453 --> 00:23:38.098]  I addressed the threats facing our world and I presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for all of humanity.
[00:24:01.704 --> 00:24:09.271]  Today I stand before the United Nations General Assembly to share the extraordinary progress we've made.
[00:24:11.373 --> 00:24:20.762]  In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.
[00:24:22.623 --> 00:24:24.305]  America is so true.
[00:24:30.191 --> 00:24:32.112]  Didn't expect that reaction, but that's okay.
[00:24:35.813 --> 00:24:37.194]  Oh yeah, they're laughing because they like him.
[00:24:37.694 --> 00:24:38.374]  That's jovial.
[00:24:39.795 --> 00:24:40.315]  Donald Trump!
[00:24:40.335 --> 00:24:44.457]  I hear they were making fun of him a few years ago.
[00:24:48.578 --> 00:24:59.743]  Now I know that he's taken some flack lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald.
[00:25:01.837 --> 00:25:06.122]  And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter.
[00:25:07.343 --> 00:25:10.667]  Like, did we fake the moon landing?
[00:25:14.291 --> 00:25:15.752]  What really happened in Roswell?
[00:25:17.915 --> 00:25:19.517]  And where are Biggie and Tupac?
[00:25:31.764 --> 00:25:36.527]  All kidding aside, obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience.
[00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:54.797]  For example, no seriously, just recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice at the Steakhouse, the men's cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks.
[00:25:56.857 --> 00:26:03.664]  And there was a lot of blame to go around, but you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership.
[00:26:04.304 --> 00:26:08.208]  And so, ultimately, you didn't blame Lil Jon or Meatloaf.
[00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.672]  You fired Gary Busey.
[00:26:14.615 --> 00:26:15.355]  Stop there for a moment.
[00:26:17.077 --> 00:26:18.619]  Now, again, notice what's happening here.
[00:26:19.912 --> 00:26:22.353]  The maverick runs, beats them, turns the economy around.
[00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:24.973]  This is absolutely delicious.
[00:26:25.013 --> 00:26:34.095]  Now let's go to Nigel Farage, who they laughed at when he said they would cause the EU to collapse and pull out of the unelected system.
[00:26:34.755 --> 00:26:35.675]  And now they're not laughing.
[00:26:37.396 --> 00:26:38.156]  Isn't it funny?
[00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:47.858]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union,
[00:26:48.737 --> 00:26:49.778]  You all laughed at me.
[00:26:50.998 --> 00:26:53.560]  Well, I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:03.525]  And the reason you're so upset, the reason you're so angry, has been perfectly clear from all the angry exchanges this morning.
[00:27:04.025 --> 00:27:07.487]  You, as a political project, are in denial.
[00:27:08.327 --> 00:27:11.189]  You're in denial that your currency is failing.
[00:27:11.689 --> 00:27:17.212]  You're in denial... Well, just look at the Mediterranean!
[00:27:18.556 --> 00:27:19.597]  No, no, no.
[00:27:20.718 --> 00:27:24.922]  As a policy to impose poverty on Greece and the rest of the Mediterranean, you've done very well.
[00:27:25.562 --> 00:27:40.356]  And you're in denial over Mrs Merkel's call last year for as many, any people as possible to cross the Mediterranean into the European Union has led to massive divisions between countries and within countries.
[00:27:40.636 --> 00:27:43.418]  But the biggest problem you've got and the reason
[00:27:44.159 --> 00:28:01.770]  The main reason the United Kingdom voted the way that it did is you have, by stealth, by deception, without ever telling the truth to the British or the rest of the peoples of Europe, you have imposed upon them a political union.
[00:28:03.487 --> 00:28:05.368]  You've imposed upon them a political union.
[00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:19.038]  And when the people, in 2005, in the Netherlands and France, voted against that political union, when they rejected the Constitution, you simply ignored them and brought the Lisbon Treaty in through the back door.
[00:28:20.258 --> 00:28:25.422]  Alright, and we have other clips where Don Lemon then says Trump's a loser, the whole world's laughing at him.
[00:28:26.769 --> 00:28:27.709]  That's called leadership.
[00:28:28.409 --> 00:28:30.250]  And so, who's laughing now?
[00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:36.331]  That's all they use is sophomoric ridicule and demonization attacks to make us not be leaders.
[00:28:36.711 --> 00:28:42.373]  But leadership is doing the right thing and not going with the pack of cowards and pack of jellyfish.
[00:28:42.893 --> 00:28:48.914]  So I'm proud of everybody that stood against these bullies and we're winning and we're changing history yet again.
[00:28:49.014 --> 00:28:49.834]  We are the Mavericks.
[00:28:50.134 --> 00:28:51.135]  We are the Trailblazers.
[00:28:51.175 --> 00:28:52.115]  Not John McCain.
[00:28:53.866 --> 00:28:58.329]  Alpha Power Vital Male Androgen Biosynthesis Promoter.
[00:28:58.449 --> 00:29:06.335]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[00:29:06.816 --> 00:29:08.437]  But, here's what you want to know.
[00:29:09.411 --> 00:29:15.374]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[00:29:16.034 --> 00:29:19.575]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[00:29:20.456 --> 00:29:28.479]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:36.723]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[00:29:37.503 --> 00:29:41.291]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[00:29:41.872 --> 00:29:42.633]  It's Alpha Power.
[00:29:42.713 --> 00:29:45.819]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[00:29:46.890 --> 00:30:01.760]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:07.484]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[00:30:07.844 --> 00:30:09.365]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[00:30:09.685 --> 00:30:11.006]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:15.629]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpha Power because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:20.473]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[00:30:20.493 --> 00:30:21.834]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:28.879]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:31.320]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:33.502]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[00:30:33.522 --> 00:30:34.643]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[00:30:34.683 --> 00:30:36.344]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[00:30:39.246 --> 00:30:40.087]  But here's an example.
[00:30:40.908 --> 00:30:48.515]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[00:30:48.535 --> 00:30:50.236]  It just has a little bit in it.
[00:30:50.717 --> 00:30:56.882]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[00:30:57.563 --> 00:31:02.645]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[00:31:02.945 --> 00:31:11.268]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[00:31:11.688 --> 00:31:12.709]  Nobody else does that.
[00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:15.450]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:32.118]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:41.485]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[00:31:41.845 --> 00:31:43.866]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[00:31:44.247 --> 00:31:51.972]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, AAA, 253-3139.
[00:31:52.272 --> 00:31:53.633]  A total 360 win.
[00:31:53.853 --> 00:31:58.637]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds
[00:31:58.797 --> 00:31:58.937]  I think.
[00:32:23.703 --> 00:32:29.645]  This baby is the most souped up, awesome version the top formulators can come up with and still be affordable.
[00:32:30.226 --> 00:32:31.986]  It's one of the very best heart pills out there.
[00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:33.067]  It's ExtendoWise.
[00:32:33.267 --> 00:32:36.008]  So, get some for yourself and family and friends.
[00:32:36.368 --> 00:32:39.429]  It's got the very best fish oil from the Fjords.
[00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:44.831]  It's very, very pure, very, very clean and has the EPA type that is specifically good for the heart, cardiovascular system.
[00:32:45.512 --> 00:32:48.993]  It's got the properly formulated type of CoQ10 and more.
[00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:50.894]  It is ExtendoWise.
[00:32:50.934 --> 00:32:53.135]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:58.116 --> 00:33:00.735]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.846 --> 00:33:53.875]  We have 41 days till this do or die situation and everybody needs to be on the right side of history right now to try to bring back sovereignty, bring back free market, bring back real debate, real free speech like President Trump and others are doing.
[00:33:55.106 --> 00:34:02.712]  And yes, to take a line from the original Misfits, this is where eagles dare to be public and to be supporting Western civilization.
[00:34:03.473 --> 00:34:13.321]  Now, I know of our guests quite a bit because growing up at the time I was like 10 years old, I liked hard rock, heavy metal, and I liked good punk rock, and I really liked the Misfits.
[00:34:13.361 --> 00:34:16.824]  And then I learned, about 12 or 13, that all the wild girls were into it.
[00:34:16.904 --> 00:34:19.486]  So I've been to many Misfits concerts.
[00:34:19.546 --> 00:34:20.667]  I've been to all of them.
[00:34:20.687 --> 00:34:21.728]  I mean, I've been to a lot of it.
[00:34:22.048 --> 00:34:24.951]  With this guy fronting, Glenn Danzig, you name it.
[00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:38.244]  And so, I'm not really a fanboy, usually trying to get musicians and people on, but when I really like the band, and when somebody's being persecuted for free speech, promoting us, well then, it's amazing.
[00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:39.425]  So, I'm excited.
[00:34:39.465 --> 00:34:41.847]  By the way, I haven't chimed in on Willie Nelson, who I'm good friends with.
[00:34:43.268 --> 00:34:44.529]  I caught our side attacking him.
[00:34:45.089 --> 00:34:47.649]  He's 85 now for backing Beto.
[00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:48.970]  That's his right to do that.
[00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.411]  We have a right to think he's an idiot, but he's not.
[00:34:51.991 --> 00:34:53.231]  I had dinner with him five years ago.
[00:34:53.751 --> 00:34:54.512]  He's senile.
[00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:55.992]  So leave Willie Nelson alone.
[00:34:56.432 --> 00:34:57.312]  I can tell you right now.
[00:34:57.332 --> 00:34:58.833]  So I'm just going to stop right there.
[00:34:59.153 --> 00:35:00.373]  You can attack Willie Nelson if you want.
[00:35:00.773 --> 00:35:01.914]  I'm not attacking Willie Nelson.
[00:35:02.734 --> 00:35:08.881]  Uh, because, uh, I mean, there I am five years ago, had dinner with him, and he was not the Willie Nelson I knew for ten years before.
[00:35:09.442 --> 00:35:11.885]  So let's just say that he was gone five years ago.
[00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:17.552]  So, I'm not being mean about that, but whatever he does now, it's his fifth wife, who I'm not knocking, I know her too.
[00:35:18.092 --> 00:35:18.913]  Okay, let's stop there.
[00:35:19.878 --> 00:35:21.499]  Joining us is Michael Graves.
[00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:26.300]  Paul Watson put out a video a few days ago, and I was blown away by it, that this happened.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.301]  And I think it's best that he just tell the story, but this is big news.
[00:35:29.381 --> 00:35:34.363]  Former Misfits singer, appearance canceled after a social media review.
[00:35:34.943 --> 00:35:35.763]  Michael Graves.
[00:35:36.503 --> 00:35:38.584]  And oh my gosh, they have this big music festival.
[00:35:38.704 --> 00:35:40.625]  I know because Paul's brother is into music festivals.
[00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:42.585]  He covers them and runs major festivals.
[00:35:42.885 --> 00:35:45.566]  Doesn't run this one, that's Steve Watson, Moonlight says.
[00:35:46.026 --> 00:35:46.967]  That's his real job.
[00:35:48.647 --> 00:35:53.810]  This is a big deal because they said, we reviewed him and it's white supremacy and all this made-up crap.
[00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.871]  They're almost like, you know, this guy or that guy.
[00:35:56.272 --> 00:35:59.574]  And so, he's still going to be playing in the town, but this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[00:35:59.814 --> 00:36:00.794]  And what did he get in trouble for?
[00:36:00.834 --> 00:36:02.835]  Well, here he is to tell us right now.
[00:36:03.136 --> 00:36:05.217]  So, Michael, I've enjoyed a lot of your music.
[00:36:05.257 --> 00:36:06.257]  My wife loves your music.
[00:36:06.578 --> 00:36:09.299]  She thinks you're even better than Glenn Danzig.
[00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:11.500]  I think that's impossible, but you're both amazing.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.161]  It's good to have you here.
[00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:13.791]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:36:13.831 --> 00:36:18.714]  Thank you very much for having me on your show and for coming to my defense.
[00:36:18.754 --> 00:36:20.335]  I appreciate it very, very much.
[00:36:20.355 --> 00:36:22.776]  Well, do you know how much tail the Misfits has gotten me?
[00:36:27.378 --> 00:36:27.879]  How much?
[00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:32.601]  Well, back in the day, back in the 80s, 90s, I mean, that was where all the hot girls were.
[00:36:33.341 --> 00:36:34.322]  Still is pretty hot, you know.
[00:36:35.202 --> 00:36:35.643]  Yes, sir.
[00:36:36.607 --> 00:36:40.748]  Okay, seriously though, let's get into what happened to you because this is dangerous and it just shows it's happening everywhere.
[00:36:41.128 --> 00:36:44.990]  They reviewed your social media like they reviewed your DNA or something.
[00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.630]  This is what sounds Nazi to me.
[00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:51.151]  Alex, it really came out of the clear blue sky.
[00:36:51.392 --> 00:37:05.596]  My tour manager is also my guitar player and we had a day off and we were working on some business and we found out about what happened after the festival had posted it, that they had
[00:37:06.528 --> 00:37:19.295]  Like you've said, reviewed my social sites and mainly saw retweets from Paul Joseph Watson, from Infowars, from Breitbart, on and on.
[00:37:19.756 --> 00:37:23.278]  And, you know, it's not just one person.
[00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:29.041]  It was and is a board of nine that freaked out.
[00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:37.879]  Over this, and it really is a sign of the times, Alex, because about 10 years ago, I went out on tour and did more than 50 states across America.
[00:37:37.899 --> 00:37:48.230]  It was called the War of Information Tour, and me and my guys, we were handing out InfoWars magazines, bumper stickers at other patriots.
[00:37:48.937 --> 00:37:49.217]  We're good.
[00:38:11.121 --> 00:38:14.822]  This is a dangerous thing to come on your show like this.
[00:38:15.442 --> 00:38:22.104]  This will have repercussions, as everyone's seen, just from retweeting.
[00:38:22.224 --> 00:38:36.907]  Anybody that's ever come to any of my shows, from the Misfit days forward, whether I'm playing acoustic or not, in any form that I perform, I do not make any statements from the stage.
[00:38:37.287 --> 00:38:38.268]  It's not about that.
[00:38:40.279 --> 00:38:46.506]  So yeah, I was discriminated against when my social sites were reviewed.
[00:38:48.028 --> 00:39:04.398]  And I love how all the left, which isn't even the left, are these authoritarians, because I know you guys have been critical of the right wing as well when they're authoritarians, so am I. They're just oppressing everyone and lying about who we are when they do it, and then literally trying to send a chilling effect to everybody, you better keep your mouth shut or we'll ruin you.
[00:39:04.939 --> 00:39:09.541]  So you're right, you really are sticking your neck out here in a whole sea of cowards out there.
[00:39:10.062 --> 00:39:14.985]  But it's also, I think, a greater danger if we don't start sticking our necks out, because this is getting out of control.
[00:39:17.262 --> 00:39:28.293]  I agree with you, Alex, and like you say, in the arena that you're in, you've hit the barbed wire for a lot of people, and we all appreciate that, and I certainly appreciate that.
[00:39:28.754 --> 00:39:39.805]  You and your entire organization has given me, and a lot of other people, the courage to as well, in the arena that I fight in, music and art, cultural expression,
[00:39:40.405 --> 00:39:42.846]  To hit the barbed wire as well.
[00:39:42.926 --> 00:39:46.668]  And I hope that, and I know that there's other Patriots out there.
[00:39:46.928 --> 00:39:50.870]  There's a lot of young people that are paying attention to this, other bands, other artists.
[00:39:51.630 --> 00:40:09.398]  And the attack on me and seeing what I do and being articulate and being informed about it is going to give the courage and the cover for other artists, other musicians to do this, regardless of the consequences.
[00:40:10.734 --> 00:40:24.483]  I just can't believe in America and in England in 2018, like you said, that it's a courageous act to keep your politics separate from the music overall, but to put out some tweets about some news articles, and then they come and review you, and then this persecution.
[00:40:24.503 --> 00:40:28.846]  Now, James Woods is still locked out of Twitter, and every few hours somebody else I know is being banned.
[00:40:29.386 --> 00:40:35.453]  I have family that'll just put out some pro, you know, Trump article about the economy being better.
[00:40:35.873 --> 00:40:39.557]  And one of my cousins got banned off Twitter for just saying, oh look, the economy's growing.
[00:40:39.777 --> 00:40:41.919]  I mean, this is really authoritarian.
[00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:47.625]  And it shows whatever the left's turned into, teamed up with big tech, they'll do anything now, it seems.
[00:40:49.828 --> 00:40:50.909]  Yeah, again, Alex.
[00:40:51.667 --> 00:41:01.890]  Three months before the election, top professors, right, on PsyOps were telling Hillary that they need to expand the culture war and cultural division.
[00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.431]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:41:04.451 --> 00:41:07.732]  And that's exactly what's happening here.
[00:41:08.612 --> 00:41:09.953]  I'm not that big of a deal.
[00:41:10.153 --> 00:41:12.613]  I'm kind of a small blip on the radar.
[00:41:13.914 --> 00:41:18.955]  So again, like I tweeted out, I'm a canary in the coal mine as well.
[00:41:19.235 --> 00:41:20.316]  If this can happen to me,
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:32.086]  It can and will happen to anybody else that comes out, if you will, as a conservative.
[00:41:32.386 --> 00:41:46.894]  That being said, it's important right now to be courageous and to push back and to speak and be articulate and informed and empowered by all this.
[00:41:47.355 --> 00:41:49.096]  Because I'm a perfect example.
[00:41:49.496 --> 00:41:51.237]  Alex, I've been listening to you a long time.
[00:41:52.455 --> 00:42:00.781]  And when this happened, yourself and many other great patriots have come to my defense, and I'm so thankful.
[00:42:01.622 --> 00:42:02.102]  Oh, listen.
[00:42:02.623 --> 00:42:04.284]  It's self-preservation at the same time.
[00:42:04.604 --> 00:42:06.285]  But it is good to be in this club.
[00:42:06.525 --> 00:42:15.292]  The great crew I've got, the great audience of actors, people like you, always getting to meet other folks that are real mavericks and just have integrity and aren't going to bow to this.
[00:42:15.512 --> 00:42:16.312]  But in China,
[00:42:17.253 --> 00:42:19.356]  They'll arrest you if you criticize the economy.
[00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:27.448]  Here, they ban you off Twitter or Facebook if you promote the economy, which shows at least the Communist Chinese are for their own system.
[00:42:27.868 --> 00:42:29.931]  The people running our country are trying to.
[00:42:31.027 --> 00:42:32.108]  At a human level, I am not
[00:42:57.466 --> 00:43:01.911]  I'm pleased by being demonized by every major globalist publication in the world.
[00:43:02.812 --> 00:43:06.276]  By all the censorship, all the banning, all the demonization, all the attacks.
[00:43:06.336 --> 00:43:13.164]  But at a gut level, a spiritual level, I know that I've been effective telling the truth and I'm proud of what I've done.
[00:43:13.885 --> 00:43:17.689]  But I'm even more importantly proud of what you the listeners and viewers have done.
[00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:32.315]  The reason the globalists and the communist Chinese, the authoritarian EU, and all these tyrannical corporations and the America-hating Hollywood are targeting Infowars is because they see it as the spirit of Americana.
[00:43:33.175 --> 00:43:34.996]  Not just because of me, but because of you.
[00:43:35.876 --> 00:43:38.277]  It's a place where they see victory for humanity.
[00:43:38.697 --> 00:43:40.338]  A place where they see you in power.
[00:43:40.958 --> 00:43:44.419]  A place where they see you taking control of your destiny.
[00:43:45.993 --> 00:43:49.835]  I've had more than 30 major tech companies in the last six weeks ban me off all their platforms.
[00:43:49.895 --> 00:43:53.237]  And now I've had credit card companies and PayPal and everybody else do it as well.
[00:43:54.197 --> 00:44:01.701]  And then horrible, monstrous, war criminal Nazi collaborators like George Soros openly celebrating what they've done.
[00:44:02.701 --> 00:44:05.643]  People say, hey, you're starting to really lose in the world.
[00:44:05.923 --> 00:44:06.363]  No, I'm not.
[00:44:07.123 --> 00:44:10.225]  I came to expose the corrupt system.
[00:44:10.285 --> 00:44:13.566]  I came to try to change all this just like you did.
[00:44:13.887 --> 00:44:14.367]  I love God.
[00:44:15.735 --> 00:44:29.326]  And so I have pure confidence at the end of the day that the reason I'm under such unmitigated, such unprecedented, incredible attack is because I'm telling the truth.
[00:44:30.147 --> 00:44:36.552]  And because I am accurately getting into the real issues that the globalists don't want discussed.
[00:44:37.392 --> 00:44:42.797]  We have trailblazed, we have chronicled on every major front
[00:44:43.877 --> 00:44:45.458]  All the major issues of our day.
[00:44:46.558 --> 00:44:55.141]  And not because we were the smartest people around, but because we were actually willing to cover what the facts showed, despite the fact we'd be demonized and attacked.
[00:44:56.142 --> 00:44:58.242]  You see, that's why more people don't tell the truth.
[00:44:58.783 --> 00:45:03.084]  It's because they know that when they do tell the truth, they get persecuted.
[00:45:04.044 --> 00:45:09.126]  But when everybody sells out to persecution, you have stagnation, you have tyranny.
[00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:10.887]  So I'm betting on you.
[00:45:12.193 --> 00:45:12.914]  I believe in you.
[00:45:13.455 --> 00:45:20.563]  And I believe that if you are given the real information, or at least pointed out that there's other information out there, that you'll make the right decision.
[00:45:20.903 --> 00:45:21.845]  And that's what's happened here.
[00:45:22.826 --> 00:45:29.574]  So, yes, they are taking away our advertising capability, they're taking away our banking capability, they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:45:29.634 --> 00:45:31.115]  But while we still do have banking,
[00:45:32.016 --> 00:45:40.661]  We can hold out for months and months without your support, but I'd like to know and have an idea how far out, like the Alamo, that you want us to basically hold out.
[00:45:41.361 --> 00:45:47.304]  Because I'm gonna go to the end, but I'm using how much support we get right now as a gauge of just how committed you are.
[00:45:47.324 --> 00:45:49.225]  And I'm not bitching at you, I'm not complaining.
[00:45:49.685 --> 00:45:54.068]  I'm just simply saying, if you like what you've seen so far, we're now right up to the thick of the battle.
[00:45:54.668 --> 00:45:56.089]  We're right up to the third act here.
[00:45:56.129 --> 00:45:57.990]  We're right up to the crucible.
[00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.471]  And now is the time to really pick which side you're on.
[00:46:01.531 --> 00:46:05.152]  So, InfoMoreStore.com has credit card payment.
[00:46:05.172 --> 00:46:06.393]  We still have PayPal for now.
[00:46:06.413 --> 00:46:13.795]  You can get great supplements, great books, great videos, great water filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, high-quality organic coffee.
[00:46:13.855 --> 00:46:14.315]  It's all there.
[00:46:14.815 --> 00:46:16.016]  You can get Patriot Points.
[00:46:16.036 --> 00:46:16.896]  You can get free shipping.
[00:46:17.276 --> 00:46:18.337]  There's so many great deals.
[00:46:18.397 --> 00:46:19.297]  But regardless,
[00:46:20.902 --> 00:46:28.989]  Whatever you do, just check out the site today and realize, without you financially supporting us, they took our sponsors a long time ago, we're not gonna be here.
[00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.151]  They see M4 as a symbol.
[00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:36.916]  They believe they can shut us down, they will demoralize you, and that humanity's awakening will fail.
[00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.492]  I think that they're wrong, and I think you're going to take action.
[00:46:41.852 --> 00:46:48.415]  So pray for us, spread the word, spread the articles, the videos, and visit InfoWarsTour.com, and we will weather the storm and come out on the other side.
[00:46:48.935 --> 00:46:50.516]  But without you, we will be defeated.
[00:46:50.536 --> 00:46:51.237]  We will be shut down.
[00:46:51.637 --> 00:46:52.977]  So our fate is down.
[00:46:53.298 --> 00:46:53.698]  Up to you.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.321]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:09.346 --> 00:47:14.468]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:47:15.009 --> 00:47:17.409]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:39.621]  Good stuff.
[00:47:40.162 --> 00:48:01.198]  You probably recognize a lot of this guy's music in our bumper music because usually you got like a super iconic band like the Misfits and then the next singer's not as good.
[00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:03.272]  Or they copied the last guy.
[00:48:03.292 --> 00:48:03.993]  Well, he didn't do that.
[00:48:04.033 --> 00:48:05.756]  He's just as good as Glenn Danzig in my view.
[00:48:06.297 --> 00:48:08.541]  And I love the album with...
[00:48:09.424 --> 00:48:10.364]  All the 50s stuff on it.
[00:48:10.384 --> 00:48:11.325]  I actually bought that one.
[00:48:12.285 --> 00:48:15.266]  And I've been listening to that for a long, long, long time.
[00:48:15.286 --> 00:48:21.348]  I was actually listening to it hiking in the Grand Canyon when I slipped off a cliff edge and blew my Achilles.
[00:48:21.388 --> 00:48:22.869]  That's a funny, funny story.
[00:48:23.629 --> 00:48:27.191]  But you definitely remember the song you have when you blow your Achilles.
[00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:29.872]  Michael Graves here, officialmichaelgraves.com.
[00:48:29.912 --> 00:48:35.794]  And as George Orwell said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:48:36.514 --> 00:48:54.259]  And so here he is banned from a big music festival because he tweeted Breitbart and Alex Jones, InfoWars and Paul Watson talking about the discrimination against white people, which you've got the board member at the New York Times at the time he tweeted, you know, saying whites are these subhuman creatures that live in goblin holes.
[00:48:55.179 --> 00:49:04.102]  And then you've got an article today with this MSNBC host is being sued because she just randomly said some white lady was a racist and was a subhuman and should be killed.
[00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:17.725]  And I don't dislike people because they have brown skin, but then when the media turns them into racists, and they say I'm subhuman, and it sounds like something Hitler said, and then I say it's wrong, or Michael Graves says it, and then he's banned?
[00:49:18.125 --> 00:49:19.546]  This is getting crazy, Michael.
[00:49:22.226 --> 00:49:31.208]  Alex, I'm on a street level, and in a lot of ways it is getting crazy, especially in the art and music community.
[00:49:31.588 --> 00:49:33.409]  What makes this situation
[00:49:34.566 --> 00:49:43.853]  Particularly dangerous is because it was coming from somebody that works within city government as as well.
[00:49:43.893 --> 00:49:53.460]  That's kind of being left out of the story on this individual who is on this board of nine and we only know one of the names.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.842]  The other eight have remained anonymous.
[00:49:57.083 --> 00:50:01.926]  But this individual is the director of cultural services in the city.
[00:50:02.627 --> 00:50:02.787]  Now,
[00:50:04.522 --> 00:50:15.804]  I don't think that it's too hard to imagine that this person's ideology and the things that he believes don't then bleed over into the art and music community as a whole.
[00:50:16.284 --> 00:50:17.985]  To me, that's very, very dangerous.
[00:50:19.025 --> 00:50:33.608]  I'm trying to change the world for the good and to lift people up and to make them feel good about themselves through music and art to get us out of this hole.
[00:50:36.218 --> 00:50:39.879]  You know, junk in, junk out, right?
[00:50:40.359 --> 00:50:57.604]  So you have all of these folks that are in the music and art community who are authoritarian, they're raging leftists, that put that mindset and that ideology into the minds of young people.
[00:50:58.917 --> 00:51:11.063]  With all their inclusive policies, all this crazy anti-discrimination stuff that just breeds fear into the minds of people in general.
[00:51:11.103 --> 00:51:12.944]  And I think it creates racism on both sides.
[00:51:14.305 --> 00:51:15.185]  It definitely does.
[00:51:15.545 --> 00:51:17.606]  It polarizes people on both sides.
[00:51:17.626 --> 00:51:20.167]  You see it on the social sites.
[00:51:20.207 --> 00:51:21.208]  You see it on Facebook.
[00:51:21.568 --> 00:51:24.169]  And as you mentioned, it's in the WikiLeaks that that was their plan.
[00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:25.770]  Absolutely.
[00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:27.071]  That's the truth, Alex.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:36.102]  But the good news is that there are more of us than there are of them in music and in art.
[00:51:36.263 --> 00:51:36.963]  And that's the truth.
[00:51:37.003 --> 00:51:38.983]  There's more of us than than them.
[00:51:39.003 --> 00:51:49.707]  And it's just that, again, people like me are giving courage and giving cover to all of those people who are afraid.
[00:51:50.305 --> 00:51:52.086]  To come out and say anything.
[00:51:52.406 --> 00:51:53.066]  I have children.
[00:51:53.086 --> 00:51:54.167]  I have a family, Alex.
[00:51:54.227 --> 00:51:54.907]  Young children.
[00:51:55.567 --> 00:52:01.830]  This is, if I can't do this, I can't, you know, I got to take care of my family.
[00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:02.950]  I got to take care of myself.
[00:52:04.151 --> 00:52:19.877]  And so leftists, like the one that has come up against me, are doing the same thing in a very small way that's being done to you and all the other conservatives that we see being banned.
[00:52:20.805 --> 00:52:21.505]  And censored.
[00:52:21.926 --> 00:52:23.046]  And discriminated against.
[00:52:40.871 --> 00:52:42.952]  Away from us in seven working days, that's gone.
[00:52:42.972 --> 00:52:45.354]  They're trying to target our other payment processors right now.
[00:52:45.754 --> 00:53:00.583]  I mean, so they're going after us, and you mentioned the key here, and then we'll get back into that question that I just asked, that I have Big Tech working with the Democrats, and they have hearings in the Senate and House saying, we want Alex Jones taken off the air, and the executives go, we'll get right on that, sir.
[00:53:01.873 --> 00:53:03.574]  And then, a month later, I'm banned.
[00:53:04.234 --> 00:53:15.059]  So I'm watching C-SPAN, they're lying about me, saying things I never said, using the straw man to then ban me, and they admit then, once we get Jones, we'll be able to shut anybody down.
[00:53:15.139 --> 00:53:16.179]  And now it's happened!
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.181]  And so in a sick way, they're using me as propaganda.
[00:53:19.201 --> 00:53:21.462]  They're using the cartoon image they've spun or edited.
[00:53:22.661 --> 00:53:26.184]  To then, even though I want to help people, I kind of feel guilty.
[00:53:26.464 --> 00:53:30.206]  They're using the cartoon image of me having fun now against everybody.
[00:53:30.226 --> 00:53:32.788]  That's why I'm telling folks, hey, my plight is your plight.
[00:53:32.828 --> 00:53:34.569]  I'm not just saying that to get you on board with me.
[00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.712]  I'm telling you folks, I am the first domino.
[00:53:39.053 --> 00:53:41.334]  Brother, you are enemy number one.
[00:53:42.115 --> 00:53:43.375]  You are enemy number one.
[00:53:43.796 --> 00:53:45.637]  And they have weaponized language.
[00:53:46.318 --> 00:53:49.840]  So you say Alex Jones and people freak out.
[00:53:50.356 --> 00:53:51.977]  Doesn't matter what you're saying.
[00:53:51.997 --> 00:53:54.419]  You say Alex Jones, Info Wars, people freak out.
[00:53:56.341 --> 00:54:08.310]  Conservative, again, Breitbart, NRA, all of these words to the ill-informed or the under-informed, the lower IQ audience, if you will.
[00:54:08.851 --> 00:54:13.975]  It just creates an emotional response, which is what's supposed to happen.
[00:54:17.861 --> 00:54:20.322]  They're programmed to react that way.
[00:54:20.682 --> 00:54:22.503]  So that they just freak out.
[00:54:22.984 --> 00:54:25.445]  And again, the example is what happened to me.
[00:54:26.185 --> 00:54:30.647]  And this board of nine up in Canada have admitted that.
[00:54:31.188 --> 00:54:34.069]  That they saw that I was tweeting Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:34.449 --> 00:54:35.850]  They saw Alex Jones.
[00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:40.572]  I had made a video with one of my songs and one of your monologues.
[00:54:41.133 --> 00:54:42.874]  And they just freaked out.
[00:54:42.894 --> 00:54:43.494]  Oh, I'm honored.
[00:54:43.574 --> 00:54:44.294]  What album is that?
[00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:44.775]  I want to hear that.
[00:54:44.795 --> 00:54:45.315]  I want to play that.
[00:54:46.613 --> 00:54:48.397]  It's called The Truth About Alex Jones.
[00:54:48.417 --> 00:54:51.002]  It's an acoustic song called Ghost.
[00:54:51.222 --> 00:54:56.232]  And it was a wonderful rant, a wonderful monologue that you did right around Christmas time.
[00:54:57.915 --> 00:55:04.319]  It's up on my Facebook, and I'll certainly... I'll be honest, I just work all the time now.
[00:55:04.399 --> 00:55:08.721]  I might watch a show with my wife a couple times a week, or, you know, listen to stuff that's already on Spotify.
[00:55:08.741 --> 00:55:11.203]  I know they banned me, but I had no idea, because I'm really honored.
[00:55:11.243 --> 00:55:14.625]  I love your music, and I've listened to all your albums that I knew of.
[00:55:14.665 --> 00:55:17.987]  I didn't know you've done that, so I've definitely got to go download that right now.
[00:55:18.007 --> 00:55:19.228]  So it's called The Truth About Alex Jones.
[00:55:19.488 --> 00:55:25.792]  I wonder if that'll be banned off Spotify, because they just banned like 20 apps that had Infowars in the name off Apple last month.
[00:55:28.485 --> 00:55:34.252]  I have to assume Alex that I'm soon going to be taken down off of Twitter and Facebook as well.
[00:55:34.352 --> 00:55:38.036]  I've already gotten a whole bunch of messages from followers.
[00:55:38.076 --> 00:55:43.903]  I have almost 11,000 followers and a lot of them, I get messages all the time that nobody sees my tweets.
[00:55:44.283 --> 00:55:45.385]  I put stuff up and
[00:55:47.066 --> 00:55:53.092]  And that's why everybody's got to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email because more and more that's the only way.
[00:55:53.112 --> 00:55:55.034]  We have a comedian coming on tonight, Owen Benjamin.
[00:55:55.534 --> 00:56:03.161]  He sells out 2,000 person arenas everywhere but he's banned online because he says don't sexualize kids from the left and so he's banned.
[00:56:03.181 --> 00:56:09.227]  You know he's been a top national comedian but he has to use email to get to him and announce the show the day of.
[00:56:09.267 --> 00:56:10.207]  They buy their tickets
[00:56:10.908 --> 00:56:12.949]  Talk about Fight Club, and then you go that day.
[00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:13.529]  So, same thing.
[00:56:13.569 --> 00:56:17.190]  How do people sign up to get your verboten information?
[00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:22.692]  Michael Graves, former frontman for the Misfits, and now, of course, he has many other incarnations.
[00:56:22.952 --> 00:56:24.193]  How do people follow what you're doing?
[00:56:24.233 --> 00:56:25.693]  OfficialMichaelGraves.com?
[00:56:26.514 --> 00:56:31.455]  OfficialMichaelGraves.com is the best place to go for all things Michael Graves.
[00:56:31.736 --> 00:56:34.076]  And I've been told the next thing is they're going after our URL.
[00:56:34.116 --> 00:56:36.297]  So, folks, you've got to sign up for the email.
[00:56:36.337 --> 00:56:38.218]  I'm sure you have an email list people can sign up for.
[00:56:39.232 --> 00:56:39.452]  Yes.
[00:56:39.713 --> 00:56:39.893]  Yup.
[00:56:39.973 --> 00:56:41.275]  It's right on the website.
[00:56:41.295 --> 00:56:43.097]  So we're going old-fashioned, folks.
[00:56:43.338 --> 00:56:44.419]  I'm going to do five more minutes with you.
[00:56:44.439 --> 00:56:46.402]  Please come back for a full hour very soon.
[00:56:46.442 --> 00:56:47.183]  You're a smart guy.
[00:56:47.263 --> 00:56:48.905]  And again, I just listen to so much of your music.
[00:56:48.925 --> 00:56:51.228]  I feel like I know you, and now to have you here is really fun.
[00:56:51.809 --> 00:56:54.333]  We're going to come back in just two minutes, and I'm going to finish up with him.
[00:56:54.353 --> 00:56:55.594]  I got to plug, speaking of the devil.
[00:56:56.969 --> 00:56:59.170]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're under total attack.
[00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:00.670]  But this is where I want to be.
[00:57:01.611 --> 00:57:10.314]  It's like, you know, General Kelly talks about one of his sons getting killed in the Marine Corps, and he's actually proud of him, even though he was his favorite son, because it's where his son wanted to be.
[00:57:10.394 --> 00:57:13.715]  Well, I'm not, like Tommy Robinson, about to be sent to prison tomorrow.
[00:57:13.775 --> 00:57:14.716]  He's coming up later, by the way.
[00:57:15.516 --> 00:57:17.857]  I'm not at that level yet, okay?
[00:57:17.877 --> 00:57:18.717]  I don't want to be that level.
[00:57:18.917 --> 00:57:19.317]  But you know what?
[00:57:19.357 --> 00:57:21.338]  If I've got to go to that level, I'm very honored to be there.
[00:57:21.598 --> 00:57:22.939]  I don't want it, but you know what?
[00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:25.140]  Side of me is like, let's get it on, man.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.200]  It's like when a bully is telling me to wait for you after school.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.581]  I could have got on that bus and not.
[00:57:28.621 --> 00:57:29.001]  You know what?
[00:57:29.361 --> 00:57:31.782]  You may be four years older than me and think you're going to weigh 100 pounds.
[00:57:31.802 --> 00:57:32.862]  I'm going to beat your ass.
[00:57:33.102 --> 00:57:34.963]  We're going to see what's going to happen, or I'm going to die trying.
[00:57:35.283 --> 00:57:38.104]  We'll be right back with our number two, Infowars.com.
[00:57:38.344 --> 00:57:39.945]  Newswars.com, get this new t-shirt.
[00:57:40.225 --> 00:57:40.925]  It's one of a kind.
[00:57:41.305 --> 00:57:42.666]  It's Trump beheading Medusa.
[00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:49.605]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[00:57:49.645 --> 00:58:01.456]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[00:58:01.636 --> 00:58:07.537]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:20.640]  Last month, the website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:27.761]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, stealing a blow to one of founder Alex Jones.
[00:58:27.861 --> 00:58:30.662]  It actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced.
[00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:51.611]  To social media censorship.
[00:58:51.651 --> 00:58:52.492]  That's the new thing.
[00:58:52.912 --> 00:58:57.054]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[00:58:57.074 --> 00:59:08.599]  PayPal on Thursday night informed InfoWars, which runs an online storefront that sells survival gear and herbal supplements, that it has 10 business days to find a new payment processor.
[00:59:08.659 --> 00:59:12.181]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[00:59:12.241 --> 00:59:12.581]  He's out.
[00:59:12.621 --> 00:59:16.203]  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.
[00:59:17.183 --> 00:59:18.285]  And you just can't do that.
[00:59:18.325 --> 00:59:29.236]  Jones hit back on his website saying the InfoWarsStore.com site had no political content and the move emphasizes how the decision was a broader attack on the InfoWars platform.
[00:59:29.256 --> 00:59:35.102]  A PayPal spokesperson says, quote, we undertook an extensive review of the InfoWars sites and found instances that promoted hate.
[00:59:35.322 --> 00:59:35.762]  Hate speech.
[00:59:35.802 --> 00:59:36.423]  Hate speech.
[00:59:36.483 --> 00:59:36.984]  Hate speech.
[00:59:37.084 --> 00:59:37.684]  Hate speech.
[00:59:37.784 --> 00:59:39.967]  Hate speech and bullying policies.
[00:59:45.822 --> 00:59:49.924]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:50.444 --> 00:59:51.784]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:06.290]  You know, there's a lot of different types of liberals.
[01:00:07.151 --> 01:00:08.731]  Nice folks like Sting that mean well.
[01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:10.392]  I know folks that know him, he's a good guy.
[01:00:10.412 --> 01:00:11.772]  But you got somebody like Bono.
[01:00:12.493 --> 01:00:12.773]  Mono.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:21.183]  Who gives 99% of the money he raises for African charities to himself, and is proud of it, and then lectures everyone about global government and how we should open our borders up.
[01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:23.684]  It's just sick.
[01:00:23.744 --> 01:00:24.264]  It's crazy.
[01:00:24.284 --> 01:00:27.885]  We're going to play later that song, The Truth About Alex Jones, from Michael Graves.
[01:00:28.445 --> 01:00:31.126]  Official MichaelGraves.com for all the different bands and things he does.
[01:00:32.026 --> 01:00:35.928]  But just finishing up, gut level, you're a smart guy.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:47.672]  Obviously, them trying to ban the Sex Pistols or trying to ban the Misfits in different venues made them bigger, not just that the music was good and raw and real.
[01:00:48.647 --> 01:00:51.389]  So, why do authoritarians keep thinking this will work?
[01:00:51.409 --> 01:00:57.912]  I mean, I guess if you get total tyranny, like a Hitler, or a Stalin, or a Lenin, or a Mao, sometimes it works, and that's my concern.
[01:00:58.392 --> 01:01:12.300]  They think, with big tech and this combination with government, and Hollywood, that they can go all the way, but the only way they're gonna succeed is to go all the way, and you read their white papers, they say they're gonna go all the way, so I think people need to understand, this is do or die now.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.541]  What's your gut level on where this is going?
[01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:17.103]  I believe
[01:01:18.268 --> 01:01:23.273]  That we are going to have to continue through the fire.
[01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:28.419]  I don't believe that the leftists are going to let up.
[01:01:29.079 --> 01:01:31.282]  They say that they're not going to let up.
[01:01:32.002 --> 01:01:36.147]  And again, we have to just be strong and courageous.
[01:01:36.912 --> 01:01:43.795]  And keep that attitude of victory and love and lifting each other up as we are.
[01:01:44.555 --> 01:01:47.177]  And just the way that we've been doing.
[01:01:47.357 --> 01:01:51.839]  I'm in the game of, again, lifting people up.
[01:01:52.639 --> 01:01:59.142]  And one of the reasons that InfoWars is so important to me as an artist, because
[01:02:00.511 --> 01:02:03.373]  I as well am a great communicator.
[01:02:03.713 --> 01:02:15.298]  And in order to effectively communicate a cleaner, attuned vision, there's that synergy of mind, body and soul, Alex.
[01:02:15.538 --> 01:02:18.620]  And your organization has all of those things.
[01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:24.129]  Through your products that I use on the road.
[01:02:24.249 --> 01:02:25.289]  I have my silver bullet.
[01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:28.451]  I have my iodine, my super male vitality.
[01:02:28.551 --> 01:02:29.812]  Like you, I'm working all the time.
[01:02:29.852 --> 01:02:33.494]  From the time I open up my eyes to the time I go to sleep, I have to be on stage.
[01:02:33.894 --> 01:02:35.735]  I perform at a very, very high level.
[01:02:36.475 --> 01:02:41.038]  But that conveyance of emotion and spirit comes from the core of our humanity.
[01:02:42.518 --> 01:02:50.062]  And your products that enhance our mind, body, I mean, I appreciate that, you know, they are great products, but you're in a lot better shape than I am.
[01:02:50.342 --> 01:02:52.242]  So, so, so that means a lot.
[01:02:52.883 --> 01:02:55.344]  What do you think is going to happen if they lose the midterms?
[01:02:55.364 --> 01:02:55.924]  Because you're right.
[01:02:56.264 --> 01:02:57.385]  They're getting more and more crazed.
[01:02:57.785 --> 01:02:58.705]  It's their religion.
[01:02:59.385 --> 01:03:00.626]  They're getting more and more violent.
[01:03:00.866 --> 01:03:02.487]  Then they say, we're violent when we're not.
[01:03:03.907 --> 01:03:04.768]  How do you think this ends?
[01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:09.970]  Well, I, I, I, I believe in, in,
[01:03:11.218 --> 01:03:15.380]  In what the Bible says, and so I believe that at the end of the day we're going to be victorious.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:20.403]  If we lose the midterms, we're in big trouble, I think.
[01:03:20.683 --> 01:03:21.844]  We're in deep doo-doo.
[01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:22.324]  Not great.
[01:03:22.364 --> 01:03:28.607]  Because the left are saying exactly what they want to do to us.
[01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:30.748]  Look what they're doing to us right now.
[01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:35.571]  It's not going to get any better if more of these people assume power.
[01:03:37.635 --> 01:03:44.645]  The struggle is right before us and it's clear as day and it's just going to get worse.
[01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:48.470]  God forbid the left wins the midterms.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.502]  I agree, because they've said they're going into pure tyranny.
[01:03:51.602 --> 01:03:52.803]  They're going to roll it all up.
[01:03:53.243 --> 01:03:55.004]  Michael Graves, officialmichaelgraves.com.
[01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:56.926]  Join us in the next few weeks for a full hour.
[01:03:56.946 --> 01:04:07.374]  If you're ever in Austin, I know you guys come to Austin sometimes, please come in here, because we love the work you're doing, and I love your music already, so talking to you, I wish I had known that you were a fan years ago.
[01:04:07.394 --> 01:04:08.775]  We've already had you on, a big fan of your work.
[01:04:09.756 --> 01:04:12.897]  So thank you for my family, because I know you say, oh, you're just at a junior level doing this.
[01:04:12.937 --> 01:04:13.077]  No.
[01:04:13.537 --> 01:04:20.120]  Everybody standing up who's in the public eye and being persecuted, we're all equal when it comes to this on this continuum.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:26.122]  And so for my children, my wife, my family, thank you for being a real man, and we really appreciate you, and I look forward to having you back on.
[01:04:27.017 --> 01:04:27.637]  Alex, thank you.
[01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:32.039]  God bless you, your family, your entire organization, everybody associated with you.
[01:04:32.419 --> 01:04:33.220]  Alex, thank you.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:33.680]  Thank you.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.200]  God bless you.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.220]  Guy's got a lot of spirit.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.221]  You can hear it in the music.
[01:04:36.301 --> 01:04:38.102]  All right, find out more at officialmichaelgraves.com.
[01:04:38.602 --> 01:04:44.844]  We're with infowars.com and newswars.com, the most banned transmission in the world, straight ahead with critical intel.
[01:04:45.184 --> 01:04:45.785]  Stay with us.
[01:04:45.805 --> 01:04:46.145]  We'll be back.
[01:04:55.194 --> 01:05:11.443]  Imagine 20 years ago if I would have told you that in 2018 a Nazi collaborator, George Soros, would be in control of our media, our government, and that anybody that criticized him would be banned from the internet, and even banned from commerce, and being able to process credit cards.
[01:05:12.243 --> 01:05:20.708]  Well, Soros bought control of PayPal last month, and even though we've been working with PayPal for 20 years, they banned us, with the magic word, hate speech.
[01:05:21.468 --> 01:05:24.130]  Now, if that was a Nazi collaborator, like Soros, it'd be okay.
[01:05:25.357 --> 01:05:26.637]  That's how crazy all this is.
[01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:31.638]  So they're betting that you're just going to put up with the abuse, like conservatives always do, and just go away.
[01:05:32.358 --> 01:05:36.099]  But the biggest thing you can do is call Congress, call the White House, call Talk Radio.
[01:05:36.139 --> 01:05:38.740]  Make a big deal out of this, because other conservatives are next.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.420]  It's already happening.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:45.981]  And with our regular credit card process that we have at InfoWareStore.com, get in there and get some of the amazing products we've got.
[01:05:46.141 --> 01:05:46.901]  So you can't lose.
[01:05:46.921 --> 01:05:50.922]  You get great products while you're funding the information war at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:05:51.182 --> 01:05:54.743]  You can let that old Nazi collaborator Soros tell you you can shove it up his you-know-what.
[01:06:08.473 --> 01:06:14.857]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.377 --> 01:06:35.729]  You know, when I hit a hole in one, I will tell you,
[01:06:37.492 --> 01:06:39.994]  But it's not really a hole-in-one because these people are so predictable.
[01:06:40.534 --> 01:06:42.735]  Criminals, sociopaths, psychopaths.
[01:06:42.775 --> 01:06:51.861]  That's why cops can literally, after years of following a psychopath, can figure out when they're going to strike, where, and really good detectives can actually have a hunch.
[01:06:52.182 --> 01:06:56.184]  It's not a hunch, it's their big subconscious brain going with their gut and then catching.
[01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:58.606]  That's happened hundreds of times in the U.S.
[01:06:59.026 --> 01:06:59.827]  It happens in Europe.
[01:06:59.847 --> 01:07:01.668]  People really learn how to get the mind of it.
[01:07:02.308 --> 01:07:02.849]  And I said,
[01:07:03.749 --> 01:07:05.490]  Last Tuesday, they're going to roll out more women.
[01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.812]  I'd say one on the weekend, probably Sunday night, about 7 o'clock.
[01:07:08.872 --> 01:07:09.613]  I play this yesterday.
[01:07:10.053 --> 01:07:15.276]  And then I said another day or two later, and then right before the vote, I said at least three.
[01:07:15.696 --> 01:07:16.537]  Well, it's now three.
[01:07:16.997 --> 01:07:18.518]  It's now gang raping.
[01:07:20.659 --> 01:07:24.462]  Meanwhile, all the other witnesses, now it's over 100 women have gone public saying, I knew Kavanaugh.
[01:07:24.802 --> 01:07:25.322]  I dated him.
[01:07:25.382 --> 01:07:27.083]  He wouldn't even kiss.
[01:07:27.784 --> 01:07:29.004]  He was a total nerd.
[01:07:30.105 --> 01:07:31.586]  Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:07:33.723 --> 01:07:35.945]  You have almost no news coverage of the Pope.
[01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:41.109]  I meant to play this video yesterday, running out of a press conference because they kept bringing up sex with children.
[01:07:41.469 --> 01:07:45.112]  His deputy Pope is on a secret trial for over 100 trafficked little boys.
[01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:58.141]  You've got all these other Cardinals busted, 3,000 priests, you know, unsealed indictments, you name it, just in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:59.362 --> 01:08:00.283]  This is getting insane.
[01:08:02.103 --> 01:08:11.372]  And meanwhile, the left, though, they hold up Bill Cosby, which, if you really look at that, folks, it's a setup because he was a conservative.
[01:08:11.732 --> 01:08:12.953]  He didn't play ball as a globalist.
[01:08:12.993 --> 01:08:13.754]  I'm not defending him.
[01:08:13.774 --> 01:08:14.554]  I'm not saying it's perfect.
[01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:23.663]  It's seedy, it's weird, but women go to a house, they take the drink, they take the pills, they go to a poker party at a hotel room with a bunch of dudes, and then they're playmates.
[01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:27.506]  I mean, you know what playmates are.
[01:08:27.526 --> 01:08:28.107]  They're hookers.
[01:08:30.526 --> 01:08:31.789]  I mean, that's a known fact.
[01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.093]  It's high-level hookers.
[01:08:35.015 --> 01:08:39.364]  And I'm saying, fine, send Bill Cosby to the electorate chair.
[01:08:39.885 --> 01:08:41.088]  Firing squad his ass.
[01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:42.050]  Seriously.
[01:08:45.373 --> 01:08:49.937]  But then let's get Bill Clinton in trouble for flying on the express with little kidnapped girls.
[01:08:49.977 --> 01:08:54.601]  Let's Hillary supporting non-convicted pedophiles and protecting them and everything else they've done.
[01:08:54.681 --> 01:09:00.586]  And the Vatican taken over by this vampiric cult that energetically sucks the energy off children.
[01:09:00.646 --> 01:09:01.307]  That's what it is.
[01:09:01.547 --> 01:09:05.010]  And I told you under Trump they'd start getting busted worldwide and they are!
[01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:08.153]  Arrest of pedophiles are up 15 plus fold!
[01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:21.895]  You'll see hundreds of arrests here, hundreds of arrests there, children caught in cages, dead bodies, and it just gets... The cops bust them, the witnesses bust them, Trump's green-lighted it, but the courts... it stops.
[01:09:23.696 --> 01:09:26.438]  So Leo Zegami joins us to get into this.
[01:09:26.659 --> 01:09:39.648]  He, of course, is from an aristocratic family, and he's friends with Berlusconi, and he first, five years before the current Jesuit Pope was in charge, said he'd be the Pope, said he would start announcing, we shouldn't have
[01:09:41.001 --> 01:09:46.505]  Pope's for life once they're elected, we should step down, which is now what they're saying.
[01:09:47.185 --> 01:09:52.749]  And so he's got, let me tell you, I've been to the Vatican with him, and he's got a lot of pull there with the patriots that are in there.
[01:09:53.009 --> 01:09:55.411]  There's not just evil there, there's some good people there as well.
[01:09:55.651 --> 01:09:57.813]  So Leo is the consummate insider.
[01:09:58.826 --> 01:10:02.649]  And he has been in the Islamic Secret Societies, the Christian Secret Societies, the P2 Lodge.
[01:10:03.129 --> 01:10:03.930]  He's in all of it.
[01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:10.894]  In fact, when I was there, and I agreed not to get into any details, but he took me to some of the castles and facilities and things.
[01:10:10.914 --> 01:10:20.121]  In fact, he was going to take me to more, but I was exhausted because you're already seven hours back when you're from Texas, so it's the equivalent of
[01:10:21.445 --> 01:10:26.469]  You know, you're totally exhausted and then it's already midnight there and you're tromping around under a full moon in Rome going into castles.
[01:10:26.509 --> 01:10:29.191]  But Leo Zagami is with us right now.
[01:10:29.211 --> 01:10:31.473]  You can see all those interviews, but our YouTube channel's gone.
[01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:32.714]  We'll have to re-upload those.
[01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:34.356]  But Leo, what an incredible time.
[01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:39.219]  You know, for me, the way the left claims men and women having sex or men and women together is this dirty, bad thing.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.822]  But then they want to now say babies aren't boys or girls at birth.
[01:10:42.842 --> 01:10:44.904]  They want to inflict them with mental illness from birth.
[01:10:45.504 --> 01:10:48.867]  They're targeting children because they can't fight off the pedophilia.
[01:10:49.167 --> 01:10:52.549]  They use the transsexualism as the cover for that, quote, educating the children.
[01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:55.512]  And then they look at Kavanaugh and they say, oh, but he's the devil.
[01:10:55.832 --> 01:10:57.593]  And they just escalate these charges.
[01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.635]  And then all the witnesses say none of it's true.
[01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:01.816]  What do you think's really going on here?
[01:11:02.077 --> 01:11:07.160]  And then I know you've got some big developments on the main high priestess of the Aleister Crowley movement.
[01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:11.803]  That's coming up next segment, who's in the John Podesta emails.
[01:11:13.444 --> 01:11:19.308]  She supposedly got assaulted, a pitcher smashed over her head by some activist.
[01:11:19.328 --> 01:11:20.529]  Was that a staged event?
[01:11:21.389 --> 01:11:25.452]  But again, this is the woman that supposedly is a vampire priestess.
[01:11:25.972 --> 01:11:28.874]  They all bragged that, oh, she's like 80 years old, but she looks so young.
[01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:29.494]  Give me a break.
[01:11:29.754 --> 01:11:33.276]  Got a rubber chicken head like Joan Rivers did.
[01:11:33.316 --> 01:11:36.678]  So Leo Zagami of leozagami.com, bestselling author.
[01:11:36.698 --> 01:11:37.299]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:11:38.672 --> 01:11:41.094]  Hello Alex, it's great to be back on the show.
[01:11:41.114 --> 01:11:45.557]  Regarding Marina Abramović, apparently it was a genuine attack.
[01:11:45.658 --> 01:11:56.346]  I mean, she was shocked this canvas was broken on her head by this Eastern European artist who in the past has challenged other artists.
[01:11:56.386 --> 01:11:57.987]  Well, let's get to that next segment then.
[01:11:58.187 --> 01:12:01.250]  I was just throwing out possibilities and you're the expert in Europe.
[01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:02.131]  I defer to your...
[01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:05.692]  In this group of the moment, Alex, there is a really big one.
[01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:17.798]  The Pope has said himself, during a comment regarding John Paul II, that John Paul II is considered a saint, while he himself is a devil.
[01:12:18.179 --> 01:12:20.360]  He said John Paul II was a saint.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.140]  I am a devil.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.181]  This is, between brackets, what he said.
[01:12:23.241 --> 01:12:29.004]  So he actually admitted he is the devil, and he did it when he was travelling Saturday to Lithuania.
[01:12:29.504 --> 01:12:31.907]  So, I mean... Wait, that's Associated Press.
[01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:32.588]  I forgot.
[01:12:32.608 --> 01:12:33.329]  That's the headline.
[01:12:33.609 --> 01:12:35.631]  Quote, Trump admits... Trump.
[01:12:36.152 --> 01:12:37.573]  Pope admits that he's the devil.
[01:12:37.934 --> 01:12:39.355]  So there's your quote.
[01:12:39.616 --> 01:12:40.877]  Let's put that up for people.
[01:12:41.137 --> 01:12:42.238]  In fact, we should have started with this.
[01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:44.501]  We'll get to the Alistair Crowley preaches in a minute.
[01:12:44.681 --> 01:12:46.063]  Leo Zegami, please start over.
[01:12:47.648 --> 01:13:01.454]  So, as I said, while he was travelling to Lithuania, he was presented with this book, I think, on John Paul II, and during the conversation with the journalist, he said basically that John Paul II was a saint and he was, instead, a devil.
[01:13:01.475 --> 01:13:06.157]  So, I mean, he himself has admitted that he's really something totally different from John Paul II.
[01:13:07.097 --> 01:13:21.280]  And his deal with the Chinese is gathering more and more controversy because the ex-Emirate Bishop of Hong Kong, Bishop Zen, has heavily criticized this agreement.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:30.082]  Basically, what Pope Francis has done in China, he has given his underground church to the Chinese authorities, who have already nominated their own bishops.
[01:13:30.894 --> 01:13:38.460]  And that means basically, it's like bringing people to a concentration camp.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.062]  And let me stop you, because you're so on target.
[01:13:41.443 --> 01:13:43.464]  The Pope has declared himself eye on the devil.
[01:13:43.845 --> 01:13:45.246]  Revelation is now being fulfilled.
[01:13:45.266 --> 01:13:46.186]  We'll pull the verses up.
[01:13:46.827 --> 01:13:53.973]  And they have ordered via the Jesuits, the Chinese, to give all the names of underground Catholics so they can be arrested and killed.
[01:13:54.193 --> 01:13:55.414]  This is in the news!
[01:13:55.694 --> 01:13:58.977]  He is literally turning over the faithful in a 500, 600 year old
[01:14:00.778 --> 01:14:06.986]  Ancient, secret, Catholic organizations which helped go into Japan when it was the death penalty.
[01:14:07.327 --> 01:14:10.010]  They are literally turning over the saints in China.
[01:14:10.831 --> 01:14:12.594]  He, the man, is the devil!
[01:14:12.654 --> 01:14:13.355]  My God!
[01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:38.372]  Well, it seems he is, and now he's been caught in a giant lie by a group of witnesses who have denounced these pedophile activities in Buenos Aires, and there is a documentary that was published on the 13th of September by LifeSite News, I think, and basically these witnesses are denouncing Pope Francis and they're saying
[01:14:38.692 --> 01:14:46.137]  The Pope Francis published a book in 2010 when he was still Archbishop of Buenos Aires and he completely lied.
[01:14:46.157 --> 01:14:50.701]  He said, we never had a case of pedophile here in our diocese.
[01:14:51.021 --> 01:14:51.481]  He lied.
[01:14:53.035 --> 01:14:57.617]  These victims are bringing forward their testimonies.
[01:14:57.757 --> 01:15:04.679]  We're going to talk about that, but the big bombshell here is, why would he, we come back, get into the context.
[01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:06.480]  We have the Associated Press, but you're there in Rome.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.221]  Why would he announce to people, I am the devil?
[01:15:09.361 --> 01:15:14.223]  I mean, when you declare yourself Lucifer, this is very religious.
[01:15:14.263 --> 01:15:16.404]  This is a special moment here, isn't it?
[01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:18.571]  Absolutely.
[01:15:18.711 --> 01:15:21.353]  And we couldn't expect something different from a Jesuit.
[01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:31.301]  I mean, from an order that for the first time places their own priest as the Pope, and now he declares himself the devil.
[01:15:31.381 --> 01:15:34.183]  This is a revelation, of course, of things to come.
[01:15:34.443 --> 01:15:43.611]  And I had already written about it in my book, as you know, Pope Francis... Let's talk about it, because in lesser magic, it is a declaration of blasphemy.
[01:15:44.872 --> 01:15:47.454]  I mean, as the Pope's saying, I am the devil.
[01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:49.835]  This is unbelievable.
[01:15:49.895 --> 01:15:50.878]  What does this herald?
[01:15:50.899 --> 01:15:52.344]  Straight ahead with Leo Zegami.
[01:15:54.441 --> 01:15:58.623]  I get blamed for every conspiracy theory that some crazy person made up.
[01:15:58.723 --> 01:16:01.325]  I said I do not agree with you that the U.S.
[01:16:01.385 --> 01:16:06.287]  government, someone inside the government, had knowledge of the terror attack prior to the attack.
[01:16:06.447 --> 01:16:06.828]  Oh really?
[01:16:07.068 --> 01:16:11.930]  All over Twitter yesterday, Mainline left his site, celebrated and said America deserved it.
[01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:15.692]  Reality winner had a top-secret security clearance and was helping ISIS.
[01:16:15.932 --> 01:16:19.194]  There are so many, the average professor at UT down the street
[01:16:19.514 --> 01:16:21.756]  Loves 9-11 and says America deserved it.
[01:16:21.976 --> 01:16:26.861]  There were elements in our government allied with radical Islam that helped them carry out the attack!
[01:16:26.941 --> 01:16:29.243]  Just like the terrorists are covering up New Mexico!
[01:16:29.323 --> 01:16:32.005]  Alex, you can argue whether or not America deserved it or not.
[01:16:32.105 --> 01:16:33.827]  I don't think America deserved it.
[01:16:34.027 --> 01:16:36.269]  I'm saying the left is cheerleading it!
[01:16:36.349 --> 01:16:44.576]  Your theory, Alex, your theory was not only did America not deserve it, but the United States government knew about the attack prior to the attack and decided to stand down.
[01:16:44.696 --> 01:16:45.537]  A very different theory.
[01:16:45.797 --> 01:16:45.997]  I don't
[01:17:04.145 --> 01:17:05.967]  Overthrow our allies in Egypt, you name it.
[01:17:06.527 --> 01:17:13.493]  And I think that elements let this happen, like PNAC wrote, to let there be an attack to end up taking our liberties away.
[01:17:13.813 --> 01:17:16.175]  And I've got FBI was warned about flight schools.
[01:17:16.876 --> 01:17:18.097]  That's CBS News.
[01:17:18.778 --> 01:17:20.879]  FBI knew Al-Qaeda pilots were training in the U.S.
[01:17:20.899 --> 01:17:21.780]  in order to stand down.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:22.781]  ABC News.
[01:17:23.582 --> 01:17:25.603]  State Department lapses aided 9-11 hijackers.
[01:17:25.763 --> 01:17:29.747]  Then they have the airlift of evil, flying tens of thousands of Al-Qaeda fighters out.
[01:17:29.987 --> 01:17:31.108]  Our military was ordered to do it.
[01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:32.149]  I don't blame our military.
[01:17:32.369 --> 01:17:33.330]  They'll say, oh, you're in the military.
[01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:33.990]  No, I love the military.
[01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:40.376]  The bin Laden family was whisked out of the United States by President Bush himself right after the 9-11 attack.
[01:17:40.396 --> 01:17:42.217]  And they went back to Saudi Arabia, correct?
[01:17:42.237 --> 01:17:42.818]  That's right.
[01:17:43.138 --> 01:17:54.048]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia.
[01:17:54.068 --> 01:17:57.510]  All I'm saying is there is a radical Islamic alliance with the left
[01:17:58.291 --> 01:18:01.294]  And there are people in the government working to protect Islam.
[01:18:01.515 --> 01:18:03.657]  They got this imam that's connected to dozens of bombings.
[01:18:03.717 --> 01:18:06.380]  After six months, he's being released from British prison next week.
[01:18:08.382 --> 01:18:10.885]  You said some things that I agree with.
[01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:15.349]  I believe radical Islam is the greatest threat to the United States, our freedom, maybe even the globe.
[01:18:15.469 --> 01:18:16.170]  I'll agree with that.
[01:18:16.571 --> 01:18:17.592]  Maybe the left's bigger though.
[01:18:18.308 --> 01:18:27.175]  Well, I think the one on the left is a different type of threat, and it's a longer-term threat where, you know, radical Islam could, you know, kill a lot of people real fast.
[01:18:27.515 --> 01:18:30.878]  And the left, it's going to take a while for them to take over and take away our liberties and freedoms.
[01:18:31.198 --> 01:18:34.020]  But I think we can deal with a straight-on attack like radical Islam.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:35.201]  It's the left creeping around.
[01:18:35.221 --> 01:18:36.022]  I don't like them either.
[01:18:36.522 --> 01:18:37.203]  I'm on board with that.
[01:18:37.523 --> 01:18:41.986]  Well, this is video on screen of them saying Building 7 has already fallen.
[01:18:42.006 --> 01:18:42.627]  Have you seen that video?
[01:18:43.387 --> 01:18:43.547]  No.
[01:18:43.808 --> 01:18:45.069]  And it's right behind her.
[01:18:45.779 --> 01:18:46.299]  Well, I can't hear her.
[01:18:46.319 --> 01:18:47.720]  Do you want me to play it for you?
[01:18:48.101 --> 01:18:50.482]  Well, I'd like to hear her say it's already fallen.
[01:18:50.942 --> 01:18:57.927]  And by the way, Alex, anyone could throw a video of the picture behind it as the news person.
[01:18:57.967 --> 01:19:00.008]  Well, she's saying Building 7 has fallen.
[01:19:00.028 --> 01:19:01.509]  They put the story out beforehand.
[01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:04.992]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York.
[01:19:05.012 --> 01:19:09.415]  You might have heard a few moments ago I was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[01:19:09.915 --> 01:19:10.715]  And indeed it has.
[01:19:10.835 --> 01:19:14.538]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[01:19:14.778 --> 01:19:16.859]  Well, only really what you already know.
[01:19:16.899 --> 01:19:18.581]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:27.987]  We are getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7, in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[01:19:28.047 --> 01:19:30.529]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:19:31.089 --> 01:19:32.590]  It just pancaked.
[01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:35.392]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:53.128]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:19:57.552 --> 01:20:00.194]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.453 --> 01:20:19.576]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:20:20.337 --> 01:20:21.818]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:29.004]  So we've got the Pope declaring himself the devil in public.
[01:20:30.345 --> 01:20:36.090]  We've got giant pedophile rings run by the globalists that are taking over the Vatican and the Catholic Church getting caught everywhere.
[01:20:37.401 --> 01:20:41.503]  We got pedophilia coming out of the closet and leftist publications saying your children belong to us.
[01:20:42.283 --> 01:20:46.985]  Hospitals saying we won't call kids boys or girls, we're going to totally brainwash them and mess them up.
[01:20:47.906 --> 01:20:51.007]  Because that's really what the devil wants control of sex for, is to end procreation.
[01:20:51.808 --> 01:20:54.609]  And then you've got Leo Zagami, Vatican expert.
[01:20:55.779 --> 01:20:55.819]  to
[01:21:13.078 --> 01:21:14.960]  The Democratic Party by John Podesta.
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:19.706]  She's in the WikiLeaks getting a painting smashed over her head in Europe show.
[01:21:19.746 --> 01:21:25.112]  Leo Zegami, take it away wherever you want to start again, because this is all just wild what's going on.
[01:21:25.132 --> 01:21:30.579]  The corrupt coup in the Catholic Church, I think it's close to being undone, or is that a wrong statement?
[01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:41.413]  Well, they are having difficulties now in finding a replacement for Cardinal McCarrick, because first it was supposed to be Bohr, then Kupiec.
[01:21:41.813 --> 01:21:46.054]  Basically, all these Cardinals have skeletons in the closet.
[01:21:46.194 --> 01:21:47.315]  So the U.S.
[01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:54.177]  Catholic Church at the moment doesn't have a real leader, because most of them were nominated by Pope Francis.
[01:21:54.597 --> 01:21:54.877]  Thank you.
[01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:14.238]  At the same time, we have, of course, this link with the Democratic Party in America as well as in Europe.
[01:22:14.658 --> 01:22:31.433]  And there is figures like Marina Abramovic that last month in Italy participated to a controversy regarding the immigrants and said that she even made this poster where she said that we are all in the same boat.
[01:22:31.974 --> 01:22:33.455]  And now she was attacked
[01:22:34.095 --> 01:22:34.896]  In Florence.
[01:22:35.296 --> 01:22:37.577]  And Florence is a not good city.
[01:22:37.657 --> 01:22:41.859]  Florence is a city with a real tradition of black magic.
[01:22:42.219 --> 01:22:43.760]  We have the monster of Florence.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:45.781]  Of course, everybody knows about that.
[01:22:46.221 --> 01:22:51.524]  But of course, there is also other links to Satanism in Florence.
[01:22:51.564 --> 01:22:51.644]  And
[01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:55.285]  We're good.
[01:23:11.041 --> 01:23:15.165]  Let's say he's fired acts in some way against these pseudo acts.
[01:23:15.285 --> 01:23:16.507]  And I saw, is it accurate?
[01:23:16.547 --> 01:23:23.454]  Because I read in the papers that he said, you're bringing a satanic ritual to this city, trying to bring in basically the devil in the end of days.
[01:23:23.794 --> 01:23:24.815]  That's why I'm opposing you.
[01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.037]  And he's a well-known provocateur.
[01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:34.335]  He's an agent provocateur, of course, of art, but we know that Marina Abramovic is much more than an artist.
[01:23:34.395 --> 01:23:36.757]  She's the high priestess of occultism.
[01:23:36.977 --> 01:23:40.400]  She started days back in the ex-Yugoslavia.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:47.585]  We'll start with that, because literally in the WikiLeaks, but also George Soros, his son, they worship her.
[01:23:48.066 --> 01:23:50.468]  She's into Aleister Crowley magic.
[01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:53.912]  They think she's like a vampire and is younger than she is?
[01:23:53.952 --> 01:23:55.273]  I think she looks like a sack of crap.
[01:23:55.694 --> 01:23:57.376]  Looks like a big, disgusting maggot.
[01:23:58.177 --> 01:24:01.721]  Anyway, I can't even look at her.
[01:24:02.242 --> 01:24:04.244]  But why do they worship this pustule?
[01:24:06.522 --> 01:24:16.315]  Well, she comes from a sort of aristocratic, occult background that was also linked to the Soviet Union.
[01:24:17.156 --> 01:24:20.941]  At the time, she was a very privileged person in Yugoslavia.
[01:24:21.482 --> 01:24:26.523]  And from a very early age, she started to get involved with occultism.
[01:24:26.963 --> 01:24:35.865]  And she also embraced the philosophy of Alistair Crowley through a guy called Michael Berthiault, who is based in Chicago.
[01:24:36.346 --> 01:24:38.586]  And he's a homosexual.
[01:24:38.746 --> 01:24:42.087]  At the same time, he's a bishop, self-declared homosexual.
[01:24:42.127 --> 01:24:46.568]  But he runs this homosexual secret society called the Coranzon Club.
[01:24:46.868 --> 01:24:50.449]  So at the same time, he runs also another secret society that had
[01:24:51.309 --> 01:24:51.449]  Yeah.
[01:24:51.489 --> 01:24:53.271]  So what this guy is actually
[01:25:16.571 --> 01:25:19.194]  Well, that's why in her Reddit Ask Me Anything, she said,
[01:25:39.212 --> 01:25:42.174]  I don't think she's even near the top, but she's their probe.
[01:25:42.334 --> 01:25:44.656]  She's their coming out individual.
[01:25:45.136 --> 01:25:52.542]  And you know, I talked to Stanley Kubrick's daughter, and it was all off record, so I can't get into the details, but all hell broke loose after I interviewed her for two days.
[01:25:52.562 --> 01:25:54.924]  And we should re-upload those interviews.
[01:25:54.964 --> 01:25:55.764]  YouTube took them down.
[01:25:55.784 --> 01:25:58.506]  But he was never part of the occult, but it was everywhere.
[01:25:58.967 --> 01:26:01.689]  And it basically confirmed a lot of things we already knew, Leo.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:19.622]  Well, the strange thing is that even, I mean, after this accident, the mayor of Florence, of course, from the Democratic Party, of course, a close friend of the Clintons, the mayor of Florence apologized, said, oh, we are with you, Marina, sorry for this.
[01:26:20.323 --> 01:26:22.344]  I mean, she's just an artist.
[01:26:22.384 --> 01:26:23.984]  She had broken a canvas on her head.
[01:26:24.064 --> 01:26:25.284]  Don't make a big deal out of it.
[01:26:25.365 --> 01:26:32.887]  Instead, of course, the Mayor of Florence had to endorse and give his support because she is definitely an idol of the left wing.
[01:26:32.907 --> 01:26:38.788]  And she's politicizing her art, not only using it for occult means.
[01:26:38.828 --> 01:26:40.549]  And this is becoming more and more evident.
[01:26:41.522 --> 01:26:52.433]  We come back with one of the leading experts in the Vatican and the world, and I knew who he was 15 years ago and read some of his books and thought, when it all came true, when I met him in Rome, he's just amazing.
[01:26:52.453 --> 01:26:55.476]  We'll come back with Leo Zagami on the other side.
[01:26:55.917 --> 01:27:00.341]  Get Bravadovich off the screen, I can't look at her anymore, that mental illness, that demon creature.
[01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:03.525]  Before we go any further, remember,
[01:27:04.451 --> 01:27:08.493]  We're doing a special 16-hour broadcast today, right through midnight tonight.
[01:27:08.553 --> 01:27:10.034]  I'll be here, a bunch of big guests tonight.
[01:27:10.374 --> 01:27:11.995]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:27:12.455 --> 01:27:17.397]  If you'll just email your friends and family and neighbors and co-workers and say, hey, this is the censored show.
[01:27:17.877 --> 01:27:19.058]  This is what they don't want you to hear.
[01:27:19.918 --> 01:27:21.079]  He's being demonized everywhere.
[01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:24.921]  Why don't you find out what's really being said and what's really
[01:27:26.209 --> 01:27:37.590]  Going on and I'm taking on the devil worshiping child molesters and it's all been proven and that's why they hate our guts and they're so close to defeat so anytime I get You know a little bit of apprehension here.
[01:27:37.611 --> 01:27:38.472]  I just think about the children
[01:27:39.804 --> 01:27:45.186]  And now these vampires are literally sucking their souls, and then I man up, just go to the next level.
[01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:46.546]  So, spread the links.
[01:27:46.627 --> 01:27:48.247]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:27:48.907 --> 01:27:53.289]  They banned us on the apps, except for the Android app, and they'll probably ban that too, but you can download it.
[01:27:53.509 --> 01:27:54.369]  It'll still be on your phone.
[01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:56.270]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.850]  And then this.
[01:27:58.271 --> 01:28:03.253]  Whatever station you're listening to on radio, or watching on TV or cable, tell people.
[01:28:03.413 --> 01:28:05.694]  There are a lot of stations have us on 24 hours a day.
[01:28:06.354 --> 01:28:06.854]  Get them out.
[01:28:06.974 --> 01:28:09.155]  We don't list all the stations, because they then harass them.
[01:28:09.892 --> 01:28:12.715]  So you gotta look in your area, find out, and then spread the word.
[01:28:12.775 --> 01:28:14.877]  We're getting a lot of big affiliates.
[01:28:15.638 --> 01:28:16.599]  And it's neck and neck.
[01:28:16.659 --> 01:28:18.901]  Every time the enemy does something, it's like Newtonian physics.
[01:28:19.342 --> 01:28:24.127]  God just matches it, you match it, but so it's just... It's just a free will thing.
[01:28:24.527 --> 01:28:26.870]  And so we're gonna see where this convergence goes.
[01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:28.992]  But separately, see this shirt?
[01:28:31.269 --> 01:28:32.870]  I just loved it back in the Trump campaign.
[01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:36.091]  Well, it's Trump with the severed head of the Gorgon Hillary.
[01:28:36.451 --> 01:28:37.291]  This is metaphysical.
[01:28:37.331 --> 01:28:37.791]  It's political.
[01:28:37.811 --> 01:28:38.812]  We don't want to cut her head off for real.
[01:28:38.832 --> 01:28:39.912]  We already did politically.
[01:28:40.472 --> 01:28:44.033]  And it's a great shirt to have at Infowars.com on the left shoulder.

[01:28:53.451 --> 01:28:55.911]  Body that uses a medicinal herb for thousands of years.
[01:28:55.971 --> 01:28:58.552]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[01:28:58.952 --> 01:29:04.273]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[01:29:04.514 --> 01:29:06.174]  And it's got the turmeric root extract.
[01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:12.621]  The Boswellia Serrata Extract, Organic Spearmint, Sage, Lemon Balm, Thyme Leaves, and Piperine from Black Pepper.

[01:30:27.382 --> 01:30:27.962]  You're on the air.
[01:30:27.982 --> 01:30:28.402]  Go ahead.
[01:30:28.562 --> 01:30:29.303]  Alex Jones.
[01:30:29.523 --> 01:30:30.784]  Good to talk to you again, sir.
[01:30:30.944 --> 01:30:31.904]  We are Alex Jones.
[01:30:32.024 --> 01:30:33.225]  We're Julian Assange.
[01:30:33.505 --> 01:30:39.108]  Thanks for exposing the Skynet program launching in China where the, you know, the robots are taking over.
[01:30:39.188 --> 01:30:40.889]  Julian Assange is talking about it now.
[01:30:40.989 --> 01:30:41.870]  We are the resistance.
[01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:43.170]  I use the products.
[01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:45.271]  Everyone should go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:46.512]  Get the Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:46.572 --> 01:30:48.353]  I've been using that like four years.
[01:30:48.834 --> 01:30:50.715]  No, brother, you're doing a great job.
[01:30:50.736 --> 01:30:52.357]  But what's frustrating is it's all admitted.
[01:31:09.355 --> 01:31:18.458]  You see the big think tanks and John P. Holdren saying put fluoride in the water to lower their IQs and then they do it and they're just such evil jerks.
[01:31:18.498 --> 01:31:19.459]  They're so cold-blooded.
[01:31:19.579 --> 01:31:23.680]  I know, it's like, why can't they just, you know, let us be and have us run our own lives?
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.841]  You know, people talk about, you know, states' rights.
[01:31:26.181 --> 01:31:32.743]  I think, you know, individual rights is what it comes down to, you know, and medical freedom and the right to choose what's in our own bodies.
[01:31:32.823 --> 01:31:37.045]  And I choose to have the Infowars products in my body because I'm trying to fight these globalists.
[01:31:37.245 --> 01:31:42.174]  Well, I can tell you, X2, unfortunately it's our last run of it, and the special has to end this weekend at 25% off.
[01:31:42.294 --> 01:31:47.182]  It's amazing, and again, just having good iodine in your body versus the bad allergens is night and day.
[01:31:47.223 --> 01:31:48.024]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:31:48.064 --> 01:31:48.926]  I appreciate your call.
[01:31:56.647 --> 01:31:57.608]  Hey, have you heard?
[01:31:58.089 --> 01:32:00.152]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[01:32:00.232 --> 01:32:01.533]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[01:32:01.714 --> 01:32:02.755]  They're all censoring us.
[01:32:03.116 --> 01:32:09.023]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[01:32:09.324 --> 01:32:12.348]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[01:32:23.311 --> 01:32:29.713]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[01:32:29.793 --> 01:32:36.596]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[01:32:36.616 --> 01:32:52.141]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[01:32:57.054 --> 01:33:03.297]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:10.099 --> 01:33:11.460]  Stand up and be counted.
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:19.603]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:20.984 --> 01:33:23.125]  Rallying patriots worldwide,
[01:33:27.319 --> 01:33:30.041]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:40.791 --> 01:33:43.313]  We are right in the middle of a special 16-hour broadcast.
[01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:44.974]  We're going right through midnight tonight.
[01:33:45.034 --> 01:33:48.297]  A bunch of special guests, comedians, you name it, you don't want to miss it.
[01:33:48.798 --> 01:33:52.801]  And again, it's an act of rebellion to spread those links to InfoWars.com.
[01:33:53.001 --> 01:33:53.742]  So crank it up!
[01:33:56.092 --> 01:33:58.114]  Stand up and be counted, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:58.134 --> 01:33:59.916]  Decide which side you're on.
[01:34:00.857 --> 01:34:05.362]  And stop ceding your energy and your will to the globalists.
[01:34:06.383 --> 01:34:09.827]  Make the spiritual decision to stand against them and throw fear to the side.
[01:34:10.447 --> 01:34:12.550]  And then, like the Red Sea, the waters part.
[01:34:19.241 --> 01:34:25.245]  Leo Zegami is our guest for another segment, and I've got a bunch of clips, and we've got Vox Day joining us, and just a bunch of other things.
[01:34:25.265 --> 01:34:31.689]  I want to play this video, Vladimir Putin tests terrifying new anti-ship missiles by blowing up a fleet of warships in training exercise.
[01:34:33.209 --> 01:34:38.393]  But I want to ask Leo Zegami, big pitcher here in a moment, but I didn't plug first hour, so I need to plug or we won't be here.
[01:34:39.333 --> 01:34:40.374]  You keep coming through.
[01:34:41.837 --> 01:34:44.180]  But I don't come through promoting the products.
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.322]  X2 is the best halogen.
[01:34:46.943 --> 01:34:48.704]  It's the purest iodine you can find on the market.
[01:34:49.625 --> 01:34:50.486]  It's in the palm oil.
[01:34:50.586 --> 01:34:51.127]  It's organic.
[01:34:51.167 --> 01:34:54.310]  We get it from oil companies that get it at 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[01:34:56.353 --> 01:34:59.756]  And it's part of the industrial sabotage we're under, that these companies always find out who we are.
[01:34:59.796 --> 01:35:01.298]  They try to jack up the prices and play games.
[01:35:01.338 --> 01:35:03.380]  And I just, I broke the contract, so that's it for X2.
[01:35:04.457 --> 01:35:05.017]  It's amazing.
[01:35:05.318 --> 01:35:06.258]  I'm opening another company.
[01:35:06.278 --> 01:35:06.919]  We're working on it.
[01:35:06.959 --> 01:35:09.641]  Looks like we've got some ideas, but it's going to be a while till we get more in.
[01:35:09.961 --> 01:35:10.841]  It'll be under a new name.
[01:35:10.861 --> 01:35:13.463]  When you reformulate under the FDA rules, you've got to change the name.
[01:35:13.483 --> 01:35:15.925]  But this is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[01:35:16.305 --> 01:35:16.605]  Get it.
[01:35:16.806 --> 01:35:20.088]  Experience why so many people are deficient in it.
[01:35:20.108 --> 01:35:24.311]  4.9 star reviews.
[01:35:24.331 --> 01:35:24.971]  6,000 plus reviews.
[01:35:26.172 --> 01:35:24.971]  98%.
[01:35:26.232 --> 01:35:27.873]  Nobody else has got that on Power Reviews.
[01:35:28.854 --> 01:35:30.095]  The sale's still up there.
[01:35:31.308 --> 01:35:33.110]  Because I'm coming up with new specials in the next few days.
[01:35:33.150 --> 01:35:34.351]  I've just been too busy to even do that.
[01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:35.492]  Like, I'm too busy to plug.
[01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:37.413]  So, InfoWorksStore.com.
[01:35:37.433 --> 01:35:38.534]  We have some of the new specials.
[01:35:38.554 --> 01:35:40.396]  I just haven't got rid of this one yet.
[01:35:40.416 --> 01:35:41.817]  40% off the amazing Nootropic Brain Force.
[01:35:41.837 --> 01:35:42.337]  People love it.
[01:35:42.378 --> 01:35:42.878]  It's excellent.
[01:35:43.879 --> 01:35:44.359]  40% off Secret 12.
[01:35:44.699 --> 01:35:46.041]  Highest quality organic B12.
[01:35:46.161 --> 01:35:47.021]  BuzzFeed tested it.
[01:35:47.502 --> 01:35:50.244]  And said, oh, his is real clean and real good, but the best is this.
[01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:52.967]  Well, ours is the private label of what they said is the best in the country.
[01:35:53.167 --> 01:35:53.927]  What morons.
[01:35:55.689 --> 01:35:58.872]  Oh, and ours was $10 less than what Jeff Bezos sells.
[01:35:59.776 --> 01:36:02.058]  And why does Bezos have some supplements that are amongst the best?
[01:36:02.579 --> 01:36:04.781]  Because you want it to work so people reorder it.
[01:36:05.762 --> 01:36:07.123]  The point is, these are products you need.
[01:36:07.223 --> 01:36:11.267]  Air filtration, water filtration, non-zuma earlum seeds, books, t-shirts, videos.
[01:36:11.847 --> 01:36:19.614]  I've got the new George Washington in his prime Indian War shirt that
[01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:24.834]  Great patriots in a local military group designed and put together.
[01:36:25.394 --> 01:36:27.697]  It's got him with the tomahawk and the musket.
[01:36:28.177 --> 01:36:29.199]  So that's another bestseller.
[01:36:29.239 --> 01:36:31.902]  And these are limited editions at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:36:31.982 --> 01:36:35.105]  Okay, that said, go to LeoSugami.com and get his amazing books.
[01:36:35.125 --> 01:36:41.692]  Leo, you, six, seven years ago, whenever you were, I mean, I know it was five years before he got in,
[01:36:42.623 --> 01:36:48.387]  Wrote the book on Pope Francis and predicted it all and it's all come true and the pedophile rings and everything.
[01:36:48.747 --> 01:37:00.295]  So give us the next future over the horizon view with your great radar system about what you think is going to happen next, where the world is right now, how Trump ties in, who the different big players are.
[01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:06.620]  But just give us the basic boil down of this epic battle, who the bad guys are, who the good guys are and what you think is going to happen next.
[01:37:08.308 --> 01:37:14.771]  Well, this epic battle internal now to the Catholic Church has moved to the United States of America, as you know.
[01:37:14.791 --> 01:37:22.674]  A few days ago, a priest burned a rainbow flag outside the Chicago church in protest of Cardinal Blaise Kupiec.
[01:37:23.394 --> 01:37:26.796]  And this guy is Reverend Paul Kalczyk.
[01:37:26.956 --> 01:37:33.539]  I hope I spell his name well, because he needs our support, because he's been now removed from his office four days ago.
[01:37:34.647 --> 01:37:44.379]  After he was leading with a few parishioners a prayer of exorcism over this rainbow flag that was used and found in a parish.
[01:37:45.254 --> 01:37:48.296]  And apparently it wasn't just a normal rainbow flag.
[01:37:48.356 --> 01:37:51.398]  It had also symbols of the Catholic Church on it.
[01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:59.244]  So that's why Karl Schick led these parishioners in a play of exorcism for this for this flag.
[01:37:59.724 --> 01:38:05.788]  But of course, Cardinal Blaise Cupich, who is with Pope Francis, didn't like that.
[01:38:05.848 --> 01:38:16.117]  And by the way, there's no doubt that the LGBT, I don't hate any of those people for what they do, but when they go after children, it's LBGTP, and it's now a cover for pedophilia.
[01:38:16.377 --> 01:38:20.801]  The LGBT movement in the main, the big media, the big companies, are pro-pedophilia.
[01:38:23.496 --> 01:38:33.002]  Well, unfortunately, the Vatican seems to be pro-pedophilia because, as I said in past shows, there is a large percentage of their clergy that is homosexual.
[01:38:33.442 --> 01:38:41.848]  There is also a large percentage that is participating in acts of pedophilia, and the ones who are not participating in acts of pedophilia are covering up for the ones who are
[01:38:42.248 --> 01:38:48.033]  And we have our media covering it up, because it's in the police reports that five, six men are raping little eight-year-old boys.
[01:38:48.273 --> 01:38:49.273]  They're begging for mommy.
[01:38:49.534 --> 01:38:50.915]  They're pouring holly water on them.
[01:38:50.955 --> 01:38:53.196]  They're saying, take the holy water, the semen in their mouth.
[01:38:53.497 --> 01:38:57.740]  I don't want to get into details, but these are, for those that don't know, these are classic blasphemy rituals.
[01:38:59.383 --> 01:39:09.530]  This is a war that, of course, started when Donald J. Trump, and we announced it first here on InfoWars, started his war against the pedophilias worldwide.
[01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:10.390]  And how did you know that?
[01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:14.493]  Because about a year before he got elected, you came on and said, when Trump gets in, he'll declare war.
[01:39:14.893 --> 01:39:18.756]  And I knew he didn't like pedophiles and had said it on Twitter and things, but how did you know?
[01:39:20.785 --> 01:39:32.854]  Well, because, I mean, he is very close to Cardinal Burke and to all those conservatives and traditionalists that still exist within the Vatican that you also mentioned at the beginning of the show.
[01:39:32.935 --> 01:39:36.457]  Those people who still believe that the Vatican can be saved in some way.
[01:39:36.958 --> 01:39:42.142]  So, Donald J. Trump is really not against the Catholic Church, but against this
[01:39:44.063 --> 01:39:51.614]  This progressive Catholic Church that is being crafted... They're taking it over with their dogma of pedophilia.
[01:39:53.206 --> 01:40:00.148]  Yeah, that is crafted by the Jesuits and their liberal, progressive attitude, so of course he is against all that.
[01:40:00.328 --> 01:40:15.032]  And of course Pope Francis is the number one enemy of Donald J. Trump in the world, because him and Soros and the rest of the New World Order are trying in every way possible to censor people like us and at the same time fight Donald Trump.
[01:40:15.252 --> 01:40:17.673]  So this is the war that is happening at the moment.
[01:40:17.713 --> 01:40:22.774]  And we had a very important meeting last Saturday between Alexander Soros
[01:40:23.294 --> 01:40:23.414]  Yes.
[01:40:38.377 --> 01:40:48.563]  And they're giving him this new organization, which basically is backed by Soros, to interface with all the candidates for the mid-term election.
[01:40:48.823 --> 01:40:51.204]  So they are forming a shadow government here.
[01:40:51.244 --> 01:40:53.866]  They are forming a shadow government, preparing for a coup.
[01:40:55.266 --> 01:41:02.751]  Well, I know George Soros is fading off like David Rockefeller into oblivion, but I'm told it's Alex Soros in the documents funding Antifa, who particularly hates me.
[01:41:03.131 --> 01:41:06.793]  Why do you think Soros and Alexander Soros hate InfoWars so much?
[01:41:09.122 --> 01:41:16.665]  Because they are the ones who are pushing all this progressive liberal ideology.
[01:41:16.865 --> 01:41:21.768]  They are the main sponsors of the left-wing in Europe and in the United States of America.
[01:41:22.248 --> 01:41:24.709]  They, of course, are allies with China.
[01:41:25.029 --> 01:41:34.533]  They're basically pushing this left-wing ideology that in the end will instead be the worst fascist state ever once it's implemented.
[01:41:34.593 --> 01:41:38.035]  Because Silicon Valley, of course, is helping out now.
[01:41:39.115 --> 01:41:44.199]  This whole project and they're doing it in the most anti-democratic way.
[01:41:44.679 --> 01:41:51.964]  Alexander Soros and Obama last Saturday have been putting together a plan for these midterm elections.
[01:41:52.024 --> 01:41:56.608]  We need to understand what was said during this meeting because it's very important, I think.
[01:41:57.068 --> 01:41:59.850]  Because I think that is anti-democratic.
[01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:02.632]  I think Alexander Soros shouldn't be allowed
[01:42:03.232 --> 01:42:05.794]  To do this in the United States of America.
[01:42:05.814 --> 01:42:17.304]  To meet with Obama and to do this kind of meetings in preparation for taking over the whole of the United States of America when they get out of the way Trump.
[01:42:17.384 --> 01:42:21.227]  Well, Leo, they admit that they've got a 25th Amendment martial law plan.
[01:42:21.307 --> 01:42:22.648]  Obama put Stay Behind Networks.
[01:42:22.969 --> 01:42:24.430]  I didn't know about the Alex Soros.
[01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.610]  Obama meeting.
[01:42:25.630 --> 01:42:27.151]  Tell us during the break where to find that.
[01:42:27.171 --> 01:42:28.711]  We're going to come back and ask you, because I agree.
[01:42:29.031 --> 01:42:33.353]  With 41 days left, they're making their move on America, on the Brexit, on everybody.
[01:42:33.433 --> 01:42:34.793]  What do we do to stop it?
[01:42:35.534 --> 01:42:44.336]  Straight ahead, they want us quieted down, they want Infowars shuttered, so we can't broadcast to the troops, as Paul Revere did, when they make their next move.
[01:42:44.436 --> 01:42:49.638]  What is the next big move from a man who really has, like nobody else, known what's going to happen?
[01:42:49.758 --> 01:42:50.578]  Definitely with the Vatican.
[01:42:50.618 --> 01:42:51.739]  Leo Zegami, straight ahead.
[01:42:53.683 --> 01:42:59.910]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[01:42:59.950 --> 01:43:11.763]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[01:43:11.943 --> 01:43:17.828]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[01:43:17.928 --> 01:43:30.959]  Last month, a website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[01:43:31.199 --> 01:43:39.286]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, stealing a blow to one of founder Alex Jones' revenue sources.
[01:43:39.506 --> 01:43:48.092]  This is of course coming at a time when many, at least reports out there, of possible censorship of conservative voices and other people in the media has come to light as well.
[01:43:48.132 --> 01:43:50.354]  So Contessa is certainly a story that we're following very closely.
[01:43:50.514 --> 01:43:56.538]  It actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced.
[01:43:56.739 --> 01:43:58.140]  And we're also standing up
[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:01.921]  To social media censorship.
[01:44:01.961 --> 01:44:02.801]  That's the new thing.
[01:44:03.222 --> 01:44:07.363]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[01:44:07.383 --> 01:44:18.907]  PayPal on Thursday night informed InfoWars, which runs an online storefront that sells survival gear and herbal supplements, that it has 10 business days to find a new payment processor.
[01:44:18.967 --> 01:44:22.468]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[01:44:22.528 --> 01:44:22.889]  He's out.
[01:44:22.929 --> 01:44:26.490]  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.
[01:44:27.490 --> 01:44:28.611]  And you just can't do that.
[01:44:28.631 --> 01:44:39.515]  Jones hit back on his website saying the InfoWarsStore.com site had no political content and the move emphasizes how the decision was a broader attack on the InfoWars platform.
[01:44:39.535 --> 01:44:45.398]  A PayPal spokesperson says, quote, we undertook an extensive review of the InfoWars sites and found instances that promoted hate.
[01:44:45.598 --> 01:44:46.058]  Hate speech.
[01:44:46.098 --> 01:44:46.718]  Hate speech.
[01:44:46.778 --> 01:44:47.279]  Hate speech.
[01:44:47.379 --> 01:44:47.979]  Hate speech.
[01:44:48.059 --> 01:44:50.240]  Hate speech and bullying policies.
[01:44:57.877 --> 01:45:01.900]  Socialist Alexandria Cortez wears a $3,500 outfit.
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:05.043]  You know, I've never had a $3,500 outfit.
[01:45:05.083 --> 01:45:08.565]  I mean, I guess I have a little bit nicer sports jackets, but they're $500 or $600.
[01:45:08.665 --> 01:45:11.567]  And the average politician is probably wearing, like, a $3,000 one.
[01:45:11.647 --> 01:45:12.768]  But wow, look at her.
[01:45:12.788 --> 01:45:13.509]  $3,500 outfit.
[01:45:13.609 --> 01:45:17.252]  I always love how they're talking about socialists, how it's bad to own things.
[01:45:17.272 --> 01:45:19.934]  It's bad to be wealthy, and everybody who's rich is evil.
[01:45:20.234 --> 01:45:22.916]  But then 80% of the wealth in Congress is Democrats.
[01:45:23.076 --> 01:45:26.038]  Almost all the billionaires are socialists or Democrats, because they want your money.
[01:45:26.078 --> 01:45:27.079]  I mean, they're all tax-exempt.
[01:45:27.219 --> 01:45:29.301]  All the heads of Google literally pay no taxes.
[01:45:29.321 --> 01:45:32.223]  They all run international tax scams, and they're allowed to because they're part of the ruling class.
[01:45:32.243 --> 01:45:36.386]  And she comes from a rich family and just did the whole barista thing as a cutout stage deal PR stunt.
[01:45:36.487 --> 01:45:45.194]  And it turns out people are now looking at her wardrobe going back years, and it appears that on an average day, she sports designer clothing of close to $1,000 on her body.
[01:45:45.214 --> 01:45:47.455]  They're making a lot of money at that bar.
[01:45:47.556 --> 01:45:50.258]  But look, she posed with a black construction work.
[01:45:50.678 --> 01:45:54.699]  But if you compare what she's wearing, it literally looks like a fashion shoot, because it is.
[01:45:54.719 --> 01:45:56.059]  They've got her all dressed up.
[01:45:56.119 --> 01:45:57.400]  I love the limousine liberals.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:02.781]  I love folks like Hugo Chavez, the only people with their Swiss palaces, but then their people are so poor.
[01:46:02.821 --> 01:46:04.781]  But they want the poor to control you.
[01:46:04.881 --> 01:46:05.782]  It's by design.
[01:46:06.342 --> 01:46:08.902]  Once you get communism, there's no more welfare, there's no more nothing.
[01:46:09.183 --> 01:46:10.563]  You get to live in a hovel.
[01:46:11.343 --> 01:46:18.247]  And you get to have no running water, and you get to have secret police knock your teeth out if you don't show up for the mandatory work days.
[01:46:18.647 --> 01:46:21.608]  And you work about 65 hours a week on average if you have no health care.
[01:46:21.909 --> 01:46:25.450]  But oh, there's always universities spitting out doctors and things.
[01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:27.932]  But if your eyes go bad, there's a cane.
[01:46:28.512 --> 01:46:29.572]  Ego's bad, there's a cane.
[01:46:30.773 --> 01:46:31.293]  Get cancer?
[01:46:31.674 --> 01:46:32.354]  Shoot yourself in the head.
[01:46:33.371 --> 01:46:34.052]  Okay then.
[01:46:34.132 --> 01:46:35.152]  Because you know I'm lying.
[01:46:35.212 --> 01:46:35.753]  I'm fake news.
[01:46:35.813 --> 01:46:38.334]  Socialism and communism works so good.
[01:46:38.614 --> 01:46:41.096]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[01:46:41.136 --> 01:46:53.264]  If you're interested in healthy thyroid, if you're interested in well-being, if you're interested in having a higher IQ, which this has been linked to, get your powerful Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:58.047 --> 01:47:00.669]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.347 --> 01:47:34.513]  Ladies and gentlemen, as I said earlier in the interview, Leo Zegami is somebody who has broken hundreds of stories years before they come out.
[01:47:35.033 --> 01:47:37.514]  He lives in Rome, aristocratic family, dialed into everything.
[01:47:37.554 --> 01:47:41.176]  I met with him in Rome, worked with him, amazing contacts.
[01:47:41.917 --> 01:47:51.802]  And he has the exclusive that Alexander Soros, now taking the mantle over from his father, who reportedly is becoming senile, forms shadow government with Obama.
[01:47:53.174 --> 01:47:55.335]  He's got the exclusive at leozagami.com.
[01:47:56.055 --> 01:47:59.877]  And again, this is in preparation to take out Trump.
[01:48:00.357 --> 01:48:01.677]  They're in total war mode.
[01:48:01.818 --> 01:48:03.378]  They admit they want 25th Amendment.
[01:48:03.698 --> 01:48:05.259]  They admit they're trying to remove him.
[01:48:05.639 --> 01:48:07.340]  They admit they're engaged in all this.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.321]  And so he's saying he's got intel on what their moves are going to be.
[01:48:11.721 --> 01:48:15.103]  Leo Zagami, obviously this is critical information.
[01:48:15.183 --> 01:48:17.804]  People need to listen very, very, very carefully.
[01:48:20.362 --> 01:48:35.088]  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee has been shaped by the Soros as a new toy for the political relaunch of Obama and Michelle Obama, so the Obamas.
[01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:38.550]  This motto they have is also quite meaningful.
[01:48:38.630 --> 01:48:40.891]  The political system is rigged.
[01:48:41.491 --> 01:48:42.552]  They have rigged it.
[01:48:42.872 --> 01:48:43.772]  Of course it's rigged.
[01:48:44.192 --> 01:48:45.553]  But by them, not by us.
[01:48:46.053 --> 01:48:51.155]  Yeah, in fact, I mean, even their motto is very similar to the work we have done in the past few years.
[01:48:51.175 --> 01:48:55.437]  When they say the political system is rigged, the fight to fix it is now.
[01:49:10.785 --> 01:49:12.166]  This is really ridiculous.
[01:49:12.266 --> 01:49:27.400]  I think that people should check out Alexander Soros as the new, really, puppet master of this new world order, because he's arriving from an experience as chairman, of course, of the Open Society.
[01:49:27.721 --> 01:49:34.407]  And he's been also indicated this year in the famous World Economic Forum
[01:49:35.127 --> 01:49:43.269]  As one of the young global leaders of 2018, so he's the upcoming figure that will replace George Soros.
[01:49:43.329 --> 01:49:47.150]  This means, basically, that we're never going to get rid of Soros.
[01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:49.031]  Father, son.
[01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:53.872]  This family is going to continue.
[01:49:54.659 --> 01:50:01.686]  Pushing their New World Order and their democratic, progressive, liberal ways.
[01:50:01.826 --> 01:50:04.288]  And of course, in support of Pope Francis.
[01:50:04.809 --> 01:50:12.236]  And of course, with artists like Marina Abramovic, that promote this whole thing.
[01:50:12.316 --> 01:50:14.578]  So they have the whole system rigged.
[01:50:15.778 --> 01:50:20.941]  Why are they so scared now?
[01:50:21.021 --> 01:50:25.163]  Because they admit a lot of publications that globalism is in retreat, it's in trouble.
[01:50:25.503 --> 01:50:26.984]  Is that true in your view?
[01:50:27.304 --> 01:50:32.527]  Or if this was a football game or a soccer match, where are we right now against the Devil Whispers?
[01:50:33.717 --> 01:50:40.439]  Well, just the words that were published on Twitter on the 22nd of September by Alexander Soros are very revealing.
[01:50:40.599 --> 01:50:51.243]  He says, it was great to welcome President Barack Obama back into my home this week and introduce him on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
[01:50:51.823 --> 01:50:53.263]  He says, my home!
[01:50:53.483 --> 01:50:54.324]  So what is his home?
[01:50:54.364 --> 01:50:55.224]  The Democratic Party?
[01:50:55.264 --> 01:50:58.705]  Is the Democratic Party the party of George Soros, Alexander Soros?
[01:50:59.375 --> 01:51:02.157]  Or is it the party of the United States of America?
[01:51:02.377 --> 01:51:11.164]  So this is really revealing to the people, once and for all, who are the puppet masters here, who are pulling the strings.
[01:51:11.744 --> 01:51:22.412]  I mean, the photos of Alexander and Obama, the way they exit the room after the talk, it's like they're hand in hand together.
[01:51:22.432 --> 01:51:25.574]  Well, let's just say it, they act like they're gay lovers.
[01:51:28.622 --> 01:51:30.244]  Possibly, but in any case...
[01:51:43.745 --> 01:51:50.891]  Leaked documents show Obama was planning martial law in Maryland in 2015 is the headline.
[01:51:51.232 --> 01:51:53.874]  And it's all their own documents, how they fund Antifa, how they do it.
[01:51:54.255 --> 01:51:58.558]  Antifa is allowed to dox people, threaten to kill people, harass people in restaurants.
[01:51:58.659 --> 01:51:59.599]  Twitter won't take them down.
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:03.623]  I confront a CNN reporter who's having me censored, I get banned on Twitter.
[01:52:03.643 --> 01:52:07.487]  So it shows the power of Antifa because Alexander Soros funds it.
[01:52:09.198 --> 01:52:14.340]  And now they want to put their hands actually on the redistricting, on the vote process.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:17.081]  They want to change the law in their favor.
[01:52:17.601 --> 01:52:22.283]  They want to make sure that there is never another possibility for Donald Trump.
[01:52:22.998 --> 01:52:33.206]  So this is the danger that we have here, that Soros is starting to move, you know, his various puppets so he can get this law changed.
[01:52:33.787 --> 01:52:41.493]  And once he has the law changed, he has Washington in his hands, Silicon Valley in his hands, then he has the whole world in his hands, basically.
[01:52:41.533 --> 01:52:48.158]  The whole world wide web and this planet with China, of course, and with the communists.
[01:52:48.438 --> 01:52:51.761]  This is the first time, Alex, that we have the Pope
[01:52:52.641 --> 01:52:58.824]  Nominating bishops together with a communist country having a say in the whole process.
[01:52:59.505 --> 01:53:05.248]  I mean Catholicism was about bishops being nominated by the Pope and the Vatican.
[01:53:05.588 --> 01:53:09.510]  Now they're nominated together with the Communist Party of China.
[01:53:10.157 --> 01:53:22.888]  Of course Catholics will rebel in the next few weeks and say, why don't we have the same opportunity in America, in Europe, of participating to the process of nominating our own bishops and cardinals.
[01:53:23.528 --> 01:53:25.430]  But this is only possible for the communists.
[01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:28.673]  Doesn't this tell you something, Alex, about where we're going?
[01:53:30.194 --> 01:53:40.741]  It is, and if people are watching on TV right now, there's the article from earlier this year, Documents to Tell Plan for Civil Unrest, Martial Law in Baltimore, run by Alexander Soros.
[01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:47.626]  Notice the two videos are banned, though, because YouTube took us down, but we're going to re-upload those videos and have them added to that page.
[01:53:47.646 --> 01:53:55.451]  It's a whole project we've got, trying to hire folks to be able to upload the thousands of videos, because this is show damning, and all these videos are so evergreen.
[01:53:56.051 --> 01:53:58.914]  And like fine wine, they get better over time.
[01:53:59.254 --> 01:54:01.977]  Like real estate, they just appreciate.
[01:54:02.498 --> 01:54:06.382]  That's why they wanted the channel with billions of views taken down.
[01:54:06.522 --> 01:54:13.389]  And so, in closing, Leo Zoghami of leozoghami.com, are we winning?
[01:54:13.529 --> 01:54:14.249]  Are we losing?
[01:54:15.251 --> 01:54:16.211]  What do you expect to happen?
[01:54:16.252 --> 01:54:19.615]  What can the average person do to defeat this, really, this satanic world government?
[01:54:21.834 --> 01:54:33.108]  Well, on the short run, technically speaking, we are losing because they are more powerful from Silicon Valley in getting their message through.
[01:54:33.348 --> 01:54:36.532]  They have already the mainstream media, now they're getting the internet.
[01:54:37.032 --> 01:54:37.653]  I think so.
[01:54:55.786 --> 01:55:03.448]  If you don't think in the way they want, in that left-wing ideology, you're not going to be allowed to even talk.
[01:55:03.808 --> 01:55:12.049]  And that's why people like Faith Goldie, and the Misfits frontman Michael Graves, everybody's getting more aggressive now.
[01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:15.490]  She's number three in the debate, they don't have her, she goes on stage anyways.
[01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:19.151]  They're going to find out that the big dog is about to get off the porch, Leo.
[01:55:20.607 --> 01:55:22.948]  A few days ago, I was about to go.
[01:55:22.968 --> 01:55:25.269]  I don't want to say the name because I feel sorry for him.
[01:55:25.650 --> 01:55:32.373]  I was about to go on an important radio show in Canada, and they begged me to not nominate your name.
[01:55:33.653 --> 01:55:39.276]  I mean, they were like, if we put the name of Alex Jones through the system, they're going to block everything.
[01:55:39.296 --> 01:55:43.278]  I was like petrified in front of this.
[01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:51.107]  I mean, you are telling me, my friend Alex, I collaborated and worked with him for years, and you're telling me to not nominate his name?
[01:55:51.347 --> 01:55:53.768]  I mean, this is where we are at!
[01:55:53.808 --> 01:55:54.889]  Well, that's the litmus test.
[01:55:54.929 --> 01:55:57.570]  In fact, they tell talk show hosts, just put him down, we'll promote you.
[01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:59.191]  But then next it'll be them.
[01:55:59.271 --> 01:56:00.451]  It's so draconian.
[01:56:00.752 --> 01:56:02.352]  Well, Leo Zagami, what'd you tell the show?
[01:56:02.392 --> 01:56:03.093]  Sorry, not coming on?
[01:56:05.802 --> 01:56:06.122]  I was.
[01:56:06.142 --> 01:56:09.786]  In the end, I was just like shocked, Alex.
[01:56:10.186 --> 01:56:11.587]  I said, OK, whatever.
[01:56:11.627 --> 01:56:14.050]  You know, I couldn't be bothered, you know, with the whole thing.
[01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:15.071]  It's not.
[01:56:15.531 --> 01:56:19.535]  I mean, I was ready to go on the show with my in-force T-shirt on.
[01:56:19.555 --> 01:56:21.697]  So I was like really ready for it.
[01:56:22.359 --> 01:56:23.700]  It kind of was a turn off.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.922]  It was a little bit when you go with a woman.
[01:56:38.285 --> 01:56:48.981]  Thank you very much, Alex, and you have all my support and the support of a lot of people here in Europe that are starting to really look at InfoWars as a beacon of light and freedom of speech.
[01:56:49.462 --> 01:56:50.563]  Well, we're trying the best we can.
[01:56:50.583 --> 01:56:51.284]  We've got a great crew.
[01:56:51.344 --> 01:56:52.206]  I appreciate you, Leo.
[01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:58.638]  We're gonna come back, start the next hour, I'm gonna open the phones up and get to a bunch of clips and news I haven't covered, but this is what it comes down to.
[01:56:58.658 --> 01:57:02.821]  They put up these psyops that if you have Alex Jones on YouTube, you'll be banned.
[01:57:02.861 --> 01:57:03.362]  It's not true.
[01:57:04.022 --> 01:57:06.344]  But they just say it, say it, say it, so it becomes true.
[01:57:07.125 --> 01:57:10.528]  Like, it's one thing to ban me off the platform, it's another thing to say, you can't talk about him.
[01:57:11.769 --> 01:57:13.491]  What, I'm like, I'm the new N-word?
[01:57:14.704 --> 01:57:22.266]  But again, they're seeing if you're stupid, and they're testing, and they're trying to rob your birthright right now, hoping you think, oh, it's just Alex Jones.
[01:57:22.306 --> 01:57:22.966]  I won't defend him.
[01:57:23.567 --> 01:57:24.627]  We need your financial support.
[01:57:24.667 --> 01:57:25.967]  We have great products you need.
[01:57:26.407 --> 01:57:30.108]  On top of that, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:30.128 --> 01:57:33.409]  We've got to end this special on X2, but I haven't taken it down 25%.
[01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:36.430]  It's still there, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:36.810 --> 01:57:38.051]  Box Day is coming up, too.
[01:57:38.071 --> 01:57:38.491]  Stay with us.
[01:57:59.962 --> 01:58:03.683]  Drew's only been here about four or five months, and he's behind the camera right now.
[01:58:03.984 --> 01:58:09.845]  And I've just done this big pitch for our new product for women that is the best products, the best ingredients we can come up with.
[01:58:09.865 --> 01:58:12.046]  And he said, man, you need to reshoot this.
[01:58:12.726 --> 01:58:14.247]  Literally 20 seconds ago, and I said, what?
[01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:16.971]  He goes, what's that Virginia Slims ad?
[01:58:18.072 --> 01:58:21.875]  And I went, oh, the one about empowering women smoking cigarettes and killing themselves.
[01:58:21.895 --> 01:58:24.337]  He goes, yeah, you've come a long way, baby.
[01:58:26.596 --> 01:58:28.557]  And that just totally hit me like a ton of bricks.
[01:58:29.297 --> 01:58:38.642]  So hundreds of millions of women died of lung cancer because the whole feminist movement from the 20s and the 40s was funded by the cigarette makers to get women to smoke.
[01:58:38.722 --> 01:58:44.265]  And they continue that line into the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s saying, you've come a long way.
[01:58:44.705 --> 01:58:46.406]  You can smoke Virginia Slims.
[01:58:46.806 --> 01:58:48.207]  You too can die of lung cancer.
[01:58:48.787 --> 01:58:57.576]  So, Stephen Colbert and all these programs demonize me for promoting known herbs, known vitamins, known trace minerals that are so critical to women.
[01:58:57.816 --> 01:58:59.517]  My god, iodine is absolutely king.
[01:58:59.918 --> 01:59:00.598]  The good halogen.
[01:59:00.879 --> 01:59:07.565]  And then I'm the bad guy all over the news for promoting healthy formulas, but they are promoting pure poison.
[01:59:07.625 --> 01:59:10.448]  So, hey, yeah, women, you've come a long way.
[01:59:10.468 --> 01:59:12.590]  The families are broken up, society's falling apart.
[01:59:12.930 --> 01:59:16.733]  Hundreds of millions of women, including one of my grandmothers, have died of lung cancer from cigarettes.
[01:59:16.753 --> 01:59:25.200]  But I'm saying we've all come a long way, men and women, as humans together, black, white, old, young, realizing that if you don't get vitamin C, you die of scurvy.
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:27.542]  If you don't have vitamin B12, you get cancer.
[01:59:27.782 --> 01:59:28.603]  It's that simple.
[01:59:28.703 --> 01:59:36.849]  And products like this new one we've developed, Ultimate Female Force, this will do a lot better for you than Virginia Slims, believe me.
[01:59:36.869 --> 01:59:41.053]  So, yeah, you've come a long way, baby, with Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:47.705 --> 01:59:49.445]  You are receiving this transmission.
[01:59:49.806 --> 01:59:54.127]  You are the resistance.
[01:59:58.228 --> 02:00:03.889]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.290 --> 02:00:16.453]  When you wake up in the morning and the light has hurt your head, the first thing you do when you get up out of bed is hit that sweet
[02:00:17.227 --> 02:00:21.071]  There's a story up on Europe Wars.
[02:00:21.712 --> 02:00:24.775]  That's europe.infowars.com.
[02:00:25.395 --> 02:00:28.578]  Armed Klan turns German club into war zone.
[02:00:29.319 --> 02:00:31.061]  And the police are trying to cover up that it's Islamic.
[02:00:31.121 --> 02:00:32.122]  They later admit it is.
[02:00:32.142 --> 02:00:33.844]  This is happening everywhere.
[02:00:36.067 --> 02:00:37.147]  So this is the tribalism.
[02:00:37.167 --> 02:00:45.070]  We bring in giant third-world populations from very clan-based, gang-based systems and then think that this isn't going to happen.
[02:00:45.090 --> 02:00:45.710]  So that's coming up.
[02:00:46.210 --> 02:00:48.151]  Vox Day is riding shotgun with us for the hour.
[02:00:48.331 --> 02:00:55.673]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to open the phones up specifically for any questions or comments you have for him or I on what's happening in the world today.
[02:00:55.733 --> 02:00:59.534]  But just since he was on with us a month ago, I've been banned on PayPal.
[02:00:59.554 --> 02:01:00.995]  That happens in like seven workdays.
[02:01:03.132 --> 02:01:05.073]  They're going adverse in a bunch of ways behind the scenes.
[02:01:05.093 --> 02:01:06.813]  They are really crazed.
[02:01:06.933 --> 02:01:10.194]  And I know they've banned and attacked Vox as well.
[02:01:11.254 --> 02:01:13.114]  Again, we don't need to really get into his bio.
[02:01:13.134 --> 02:01:14.074]  Everybody knows Vox Day.
[02:01:14.134 --> 02:01:15.234]  Vox Day is a best-selling author.
[02:01:15.254 --> 02:01:17.615]  Well, SJW is always lying.
[02:01:18.115 --> 02:01:19.235]  SJW has always doubled down.
[02:01:19.255 --> 02:01:23.596]  He's the lead editor of the comic system he's launched.
[02:01:23.616 --> 02:01:24.296]  It's very successful.
[02:01:24.316 --> 02:01:26.197]  We saw the comics at ForrestHorror.com.
[02:01:26.217 --> 02:01:27.897]  He's also a game and technology designer.
[02:01:28.877 --> 02:01:37.684]  He's the creator of Infogalactica, the SJW free alternative to Wikipedia, voxday.blogspot.com, or voxuniversity, voxversity.com.
[02:01:38.165 --> 02:01:39.146]  This is a short segment.
[02:01:39.186 --> 02:01:41.748]  Some stations don't carry it, but I want to get you started here.
[02:01:42.869 --> 02:01:53.798]  What is front and center for you, Vox, with all the craziness going on in Kavanaugh and 41 Days Out and the harassment of conservatives everywhere on the left really forming into a fascistic group?
[02:01:54.138 --> 02:01:56.000]  How would you describe the current climate right now?
[02:01:58.266 --> 02:02:07.850]  Well, I think that whoever said that everything that is happening across the West is prelude for civil war is a pretty good way of describing it.
[02:02:10.271 --> 02:02:11.191]  And who are the main players?
[02:02:13.472 --> 02:02:21.335]  Well, the dividing lines are predominantly globalist versus nationalist, but there's a lot of subdivisions within that.
[02:02:22.655 --> 02:02:26.637]  You know, right now there is a de facto alliance of
[02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:36.718]  The various identity groups that are making up the Democratic Party, plus a shrinking subset of the white American population.
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:48.250]  And then on the Republican side, you've got the, it's divided because you've got the Trump faction, which is essentially a civic nationalist.
[02:02:48.983 --> 02:02:50.184]  And predominantly white.
[02:02:50.684 --> 02:02:54.045]  But then you've also got the small group of actual nationalists.
[02:02:54.065 --> 02:03:01.729]  And then you've got the group of people who are sort of big business globalists, but are still otherwise on the Republican side.
[02:03:01.769 --> 02:03:03.889]  So it's all a mess right now.
[02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:11.993]  And it's going to continue to get worse because all of the trends are simply pointing to more conflict.
[02:03:14.201 --> 02:03:14.541]  I agree.
[02:03:14.581 --> 02:03:19.902]  That's why Trump's desperately trying to launch a stability project to not have this global meltdown.
[02:03:21.703 --> 02:03:35.727]  Well, there's no question, but as great as the God Emperor is, and he is the best president that we've had across the 20th century and into the 21st century, no question.
[02:03:37.427 --> 02:03:41.068]  I don't know that his civic nationalism
[02:03:41.943 --> 02:03:44.966]  is up to understanding the magnitude of the task.
[02:03:44.986 --> 02:03:58.380]  You know, a lot of us who were steeped in the civic nationalist concept of the United States find it really, really hard to accept the reality that
[02:04:01.457 --> 02:04:03.659]  It's not a viable plan.
[02:04:03.919 --> 02:04:13.186]  Assimilation is not a viable plan when you've got 65 million people who have entered, when you've got 40-some million people who don't speak English at home.
[02:04:13.206 --> 02:04:17.329]  And they've been weaponized to make sure it didn't work.
[02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:19.851]  Oh, no question.
[02:04:20.992 --> 02:04:29.899]  There is a number of interested parties, both inside the United States and without,
[02:04:31.033 --> 02:04:37.237]  And, you know, before somebody leaps in and thinks that I'm just talking about Israel or something, I'm not.
[02:04:37.357 --> 02:04:42.420]  I'm specifically talking about a number of other countries and global rivals.
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:45.681]  And that's bound to happen.
[02:04:46.422 --> 02:04:51.665]  Well, we should talk about the big pieces from 35,000 feet and then zoom in with Vox Day straight ahead.
[02:04:54.946 --> 02:04:56.306]  Well, the moment of truth is here.
[02:04:56.667 --> 02:04:59.247]  George Soros now is taking control of PayPal and he's banned us.
[02:04:59.268 --> 02:05:03.769]  They're trying to shut down our final payment processors and end InfoWars.
[02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.889]  We've got to reach this point.
[02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:08.711]  And listen, I knew fighting the globalists, there'd be a price to pay.
[02:05:09.011 --> 02:05:12.032]  And I did it because I knew what horrible individuals they were.
[02:05:12.512 --> 02:05:18.074]  And I was willing to sacrifice myself, my name, my treasure, on the altar of having a better future like our forebears did.
[02:05:18.634 --> 02:05:20.555]  But I don't want to go down with a real fight.
[02:05:21.355 --> 02:05:23.416]  Because I'm going to keep swinging until the end.
[02:05:24.611 --> 02:05:36.552]  But if you, the listeners, really awaken and financially support us like never before with the payment systems we have left at InfoWareStore.com, it is going to allow us to really hold the line like the Alamo.
[02:05:37.651 --> 02:05:39.432]  Until we either win or we're defeated.
[02:05:39.973 --> 02:05:51.661]  So in the words of the great founder of Texas, and that wasn't Houston, that was Colonel Travis, victory or death, we are going to win if you take action.
[02:05:51.922 --> 02:05:52.982]  We're going to win if you support us.
[02:05:53.002 --> 02:05:54.243]  But it's now all in your hands.
[02:06:47.835 --> 02:06:52.259]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:54.020]  Move, bitch!
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:55.141]  Get out the way!
[02:07:01.186 --> 02:07:03.187]  America is the American flag!
[02:07:03.347 --> 02:07:07.448]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[02:07:07.608 --> 02:07:11.150]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:12.510]  I will not let you down.
[02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:15.652]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:07:15.872 --> 02:07:17.352]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[02:07:17.412 --> 02:07:19.473]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[02:07:19.533 --> 02:07:25.035]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[02:07:25.155 --> 02:07:27.316]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:07:27.836 --> 02:07:28.777]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:07:30.874 --> 02:07:46.698]  So, I'm going to ask Vox Dei, who's a smart guy, video game creator, patriot, comic book pioneer, you name it, voxversity.com, why InfoWars is under particular attack and why they're genuinely obsessed with it.
[02:07:46.978 --> 02:07:56.981]  Because I can get on an easy target, taking stuff out of context, and I thought that was it for a while, but now I've talked to people involved in the government and the enemy side some, and they are literally obsessed with InfoWars.
[02:07:57.441 --> 02:08:00.282]  And I think it's because they see it as the spirit of Americana.
[02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:10.538]  And they're threatened by the whole pantheon of guests we have on, and they somehow believe if they can shut us down, that that will be the blueprint for shutting everybody else down.
[02:08:10.558 --> 02:08:23.869]  And then, Vox, I want you to get more into the 35,000-foot view of the globalists and what they want, what makes them tick, so people understand why they go out of their way for power and control, and why they target innocence.
[02:08:23.929 --> 02:08:27.192]  And can civilization be saved?
[02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:27.913]  Because it's true.
[02:08:28.942 --> 02:08:33.044]  The paradox is, prosperity makes monsters, adversity makes men.
[02:08:33.764 --> 02:08:39.486]  Liberty has created so much freedom and so much wealth that the average person is becoming more decadent and slob-like.
[02:08:39.966 --> 02:08:43.768]  But just like there's a Newtonian physics for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:08:44.528 --> 02:08:48.109]  We're giving the choice with Trump and nationalism and all the things that are happening.
[02:08:48.449 --> 02:09:03.533]  We're just as powerful as the evil, in fact even more so, but people are seeing kind of the ghost side of what the globalists are doing, this projection of resistance, but it only becomes real if we step into it and make it the future.
[02:09:03.753 --> 02:09:06.494]  We can't just see the paradoxical
[02:09:08.074 --> 02:09:12.518]  Doppelganger of the New World Order and think, oh look, we're winning because it's there.
[02:09:12.919 --> 02:09:16.322]  We have to push it like a sailing ship has to have wind in the sails.
[02:09:16.342 --> 02:09:16.962]  Does that make sense?
[02:09:19.365 --> 02:09:21.066]  I think it made elements of sense.
[02:09:21.867 --> 02:09:22.227]  Yes.
[02:09:22.247 --> 02:09:23.628]  That's a large gestalt.
[02:09:23.648 --> 02:09:26.451]  But just go from that about how do we beat these people?
[02:09:26.491 --> 02:09:28.573]  Can we have a real victory?
[02:09:29.634 --> 02:09:32.196]  Or is it just a stopgap measure with Trump's what I'm getting at?
[02:09:32.216 --> 02:09:33.998]  And then why is Infowars under such attack?
[02:09:35.424 --> 02:09:37.924]  Well, let me start with the second question first.
[02:09:38.044 --> 02:09:51.247]  The reason that InfoWars is under attack is that InfoWars and you, Alex, are two of the biggest challenges to the narrative that they are attempting to push.
[02:09:52.267 --> 02:09:59.668]  And so they can't stand any challenge to the narrative because their narrative is false and they know it.
[02:10:00.408 --> 02:10:02.769]  And so when they are
[02:10:04.967 --> 02:10:18.152]  Looking out at who is opposing them, what they see is they are shocked, they are astounded, and they find it impossible to believe the number of listeners you have.
[02:10:18.512 --> 02:10:22.733]  Remember, they were surprised that Donald Trump got enough votes to beat Hillary.
[02:10:23.974 --> 02:10:27.675]  They don't have an accurate understanding
[02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:30.422]  of the divisions within the country.
[02:10:30.942 --> 02:10:32.964]  They think that they're much more powerful than they are.
[02:10:33.304 --> 02:10:35.326]  They think they're much more popular than they are.
[02:10:36.026 --> 02:10:51.839]  And so InfoWars challenges that directly, because when they look at the fact that, you know, only 2 million people watch their cable news television show, or only 5000 people follow them on Twitter,
[02:10:52.717 --> 02:11:06.483]  The fact that you have a large following on Twitter, the fact that you have a lot of YouTube subscribers or whatever, they find that personally offensive because that reminds them that they are considerably less influential than they believe themselves to be.
[02:11:08.603 --> 02:11:11.305]  And all their ratings keep going down, down, down, down, down.
[02:11:12.145 --> 02:11:14.746]  Are they ever going to give up or are they just going to become more insane?
[02:11:16.573 --> 02:11:18.595]  They will always become more insane.
[02:11:18.635 --> 02:11:40.072]  They're not going to give up, because I address this actually in my book, SJWs Always Double Down, and they're driven by a sense of inferiority, and they're driven by a sense of self-loathing, and this causes them to need an external opponent.
[02:11:40.452 --> 02:11:42.914]  You know, you feel a need for them.
[02:11:42.994 --> 02:11:46.177]  I mean, I know it sounds funny, but to a certain extent
[02:11:46.909 --> 02:11:47.810]  You complete them.
[02:11:48.791 --> 02:11:52.395]  And so, without you, they don't have a mission.
[02:11:52.435 --> 02:11:55.218]  Without you, they don't have a jihad.
[02:11:55.839 --> 02:12:06.131]  And so, you know, these social justice warriors are focused on eliminating the threat to the narrative that you represent.
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:08.681]  I think that's beautifully said.
[02:12:09.261 --> 02:12:12.024]  And so they've chosen Infowars as the archetype to be destroyed.
[02:12:12.604 --> 02:12:14.726]  And that was a selfish question, but I agree with you.
[02:12:14.786 --> 02:12:15.426]  That's what they're doing.
[02:12:15.887 --> 02:12:17.968]  Meanwhile, we already did our damage years ago.
[02:12:18.208 --> 02:12:19.169]  Everything else is gravy.
[02:12:19.629 --> 02:12:26.415]  I don't think they even understand the young people being brainwashed in the public schools are totally... That's what you've done with your comic books.
[02:12:26.875 --> 02:12:27.776]  They're already bestsellers.
[02:12:27.836 --> 02:12:28.897]  They're rebelling, aren't they?
[02:12:30.478 --> 02:12:31.399]  Oh, there's no question.
[02:12:32.139 --> 02:12:32.760]  It's actually...
[02:12:33.621 --> 02:12:52.073]  Kind of shocking to me as a middle-aged man who was raised with classic American civic nationalism, you know, very proud to be colorblind, all that sort of thing.
[02:12:52.093 --> 02:13:01.560]  It's been a real shock to me to listen to the way that the young guys talk in
[02:13:02.931 --> 02:13:07.357]  Uh, the football clubs in the social groups and so forth.
[02:13:08.037 --> 02:13:16.888]  There's a reason why they've been nicknamed Generation Zyklon because they simply do not believe anything.
[02:13:18.186 --> 02:13:20.087]  That they're being taught in school.
[02:13:20.507 --> 02:13:26.990]  They don't even believe in sort of the reasonable civic nationalism that you and I tend to believe.
[02:13:27.010 --> 02:13:27.250]  You're right.
[02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:29.291]  They're very, very cynical.
[02:13:29.411 --> 02:13:33.633]  And even the minorities, who are the majority now, below 40, they don't buy stuff either.
[02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:38.455]  I don't think the establishment realizes they have completely lost the youth.
[02:13:39.916 --> 02:13:41.616]  No, there's no question they have.
[02:13:41.696 --> 02:13:44.438]  I mean, you know, it's very, very simple.
[02:13:46.158 --> 02:13:47.479]  When you're told one thing,
[02:13:48.795 --> 02:13:51.056]  And you experience the direct opposite.
[02:13:52.256 --> 02:13:56.137]  You're not going to believe anything else that that authority tells you.
[02:13:56.697 --> 02:14:12.802]  And so, you know, it's very easy for people of our generation to talk about this whole shiny, equalitarian, non-racial... But the left flipped the script and totally betrayed that.
[02:14:13.182 --> 02:14:14.042]  And so let's just say it.
[02:14:14.082 --> 02:14:16.183]  It's making everybody get real tribal real quick.
[02:14:18.101 --> 02:14:25.307]  It's partly that, but it's also partly the fact that there's 65 million post-1965 immigrants.
[02:14:25.927 --> 02:14:38.537]  I mean, this is the largest migration in human history, and as the great military historian Martin Van Kreveld writes, migration always leads to war.
[02:14:38.797 --> 02:14:41.539]  Human movement always leads to war.
[02:14:41.559 --> 02:14:42.760]  That's what causes all the wars.
[02:14:44.801 --> 02:14:46.583]  Certainly a high percentage of them.
[02:14:48.618 --> 02:14:58.326]  So basically, and Trump gets that and so does the Pentagon, not that they're perfect, we're going into a major destabilization, even if we try to fix things, we're looking at really dangerous next three decades.
[02:14:58.947 --> 02:15:02.129]  And instead the left's trying to make it as bad as possible for short-term gain.
[02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:03.411]  They are insane!
[02:15:05.252 --> 02:15:14.640]  Well, if they had any grasp of consequences, if they were able to follow a logical train of thought, they wouldn't be leftists.
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:16.802]  And so we just have to deal with the reality
[02:15:17.543 --> 02:15:20.247]  That warning them is not going to help.
[02:15:20.267 --> 02:15:23.852]  Oh yeah, they seem to think when we warn them lovingly that we're weak.
[02:15:24.473 --> 02:15:28.199]  We're like, no, we just don't want to endanger our own lives destroying them.
[02:15:29.733 --> 02:15:30.233]  Precisely.
[02:15:30.674 --> 02:15:34.796]  But the fact is, is that warning them hasn't worked for the last 30 years.
[02:15:34.896 --> 02:15:38.078]  Republicans have been saying, oh, you're not going to like the consequences.
[02:15:38.438 --> 02:15:39.018]  Well, guess what?
[02:15:39.418 --> 02:15:41.279]  They don't understand the consequences.
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:43.501]  So warning them doesn't do you any good.
[02:15:43.801 --> 02:15:47.022]  So let's talk about time frames here for societal collapse and meltdown.
[02:15:47.483 --> 02:15:52.165]  If the Trump nationalist experiment doesn't work, which is a valiant effort, but it will probably fail.
[02:15:56.934 --> 02:16:05.964]  Florida elections are always competitive, and this is a guy who, although he's much too liberal for Florida, I think he's got huge problems with how he's governed Tallahassee.
[02:16:06.905 --> 02:16:11.689]  He is an articulate spokesman for those far-left views, and he's a charismatic candidate.
[02:16:12.130 --> 02:16:19.618]  I watched those Democrat debates, and none of that was my cup of tea, but he performed better than the other people there, so we've got to work hard.
[02:16:19.998 --> 02:16:23.041]  To make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction.
[02:16:23.061 --> 02:16:25.523]  Let's build off the success we've had on Governor Scott.
[02:16:25.843 --> 02:16:35.410]  The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state.
[02:16:35.490 --> 02:16:36.211]  Monkey this up?
[02:16:36.451 --> 02:16:37.092]  What does that mean to you?
[02:16:38.956 --> 02:16:52.687]  Well, I'll try to be articulate, Chris, and simply say that that kind of vitriol, and he's apparently given up the whistle, they've gone to the bullhorn with these kinds of tactics, but they're not going to work.
[02:16:53.727 --> 02:17:07.218]  We tried this one time, Donald Trump, this is a page from his playbook, basically tried to divide this country and my state, and I want them to know that Florida voters are smarter than that, that we are going to reject the politics of separation.
[02:17:07.458 --> 02:17:12.061]  Will Johnson is kind of the undercover agent out on the West Coast.
[02:17:12.241 --> 02:17:13.481]  Very powerful indeed.
[02:17:13.722 --> 02:17:17.504]  Unite America First is where you can find a lot of his content.
[02:17:17.664 --> 02:17:19.225]  But were you banned, Will?
[02:17:19.385 --> 02:17:21.686]  Or were you just put in timeout on Facebook?
[02:17:21.706 --> 02:17:22.987]  We'll get into why in a second.
[02:17:23.027 --> 02:17:24.608]  But what is your current status?
[02:17:24.728 --> 02:17:26.689]  I believe it's on Facebook where they're censoring you now?
[02:17:27.009 --> 02:17:32.932]  Yes, I've been banned for 30 days because I said black people are not monkeys.
[02:17:33.212 --> 02:17:41.276]  So it's bad if you say monkey even though you're not talking about black people, but then if you say black people are not monkeys, that's even worse and you get banned.
[02:17:42.256 --> 02:17:42.917]  Exactly.
[02:17:43.357 --> 02:17:43.697]  Exactly.
[02:17:43.717 --> 02:17:57.549]  And I was just making a point that the gentleman in Florida making a statement about monkeying around, the same statement Obama said, the same statement Chuck Schumer said, the same statement Dianne Feinstein said, but because he said it, he's a Republican, it's racist.
[02:17:57.770 --> 02:18:03.434]  Do they really believe he said that to signal to white people that, hey, this is a racist, anti-black candidate?
[02:18:03.454 --> 02:18:05.056]  Do you think they really believe that?
[02:18:05.416 --> 02:18:06.657]  No, they don't believe that.
[02:18:06.697 --> 02:18:16.925]  They're just using this as a tactic to attack him, to attack any Republicans and try to demonize them as racist white people trying to run for position in any political position across the nation.
[02:18:16.945 --> 02:18:22.349]  I mean, seriously, they are trying to, they pick anything and everything to try to demonize someone.
[02:18:22.449 --> 02:18:27.293]  And when they sent me the thing in Facebook banning me, they just said, you've been banned for this video.
[02:18:27.373 --> 02:18:31.096]  And they said, if you do anything like this again, we're going to permanently ban you.
[02:18:31.477 --> 02:18:34.139]  So my question is, is what is that, what statement
[02:18:34.719 --> 02:18:34.879]  Hey!
[02:18:34.899 --> 02:18:36.061]  Did you just call me a monkey?! !
[02:18:55.729 --> 02:18:57.212]  You get the monkey pass.
[02:18:58.394 --> 02:19:05.305]  Me as a black male... Me as a black male, I'm giving you the monkey pass.
[02:19:06.206 --> 02:19:08.290]  I can say, can I act like a monkey too?
[02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:08.670]  Can I go...
[02:19:12.782 --> 02:19:13.302]  No!
[02:19:13.342 --> 02:19:14.583]  Shut down InfoWars!
[02:19:14.903 --> 02:19:15.644]  Shut it down!
[02:19:16.284 --> 02:19:18.665]  They tell us we evolved from monkeys, right?
[02:19:18.685 --> 02:19:20.706]  They try to tell us we evolved from monkeys.
[02:19:20.746 --> 02:19:22.007]  Just totally ludicrous.
[02:19:22.267 --> 02:19:26.029]  But then they say if you say you're a monkey, you have to get banned and you're a racist.
[02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:32.913]  I get so many attacks simply because I support the President and he's a white man.
[02:19:32.993 --> 02:19:34.514]  But he's the President of the United States.
[02:19:34.534 --> 02:19:35.435]  I voted for him.
[02:19:35.535 --> 02:19:36.735]  Most of us voted for him.
[02:19:36.816 --> 02:19:38.156]  We should not have to do that.
[02:19:38.236 --> 02:19:40.038]  And it's crazy that they're doing that to us.
[02:19:40.778 --> 02:19:41.418]  Monkey!
[02:19:41.979 --> 02:19:42.399]  Monkey!
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:44.921]  I'm a monkey!
[02:19:44.961 --> 02:19:45.501]  Monkey!
[02:19:57.449 --> 02:20:00.191]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.402 --> 02:20:21.787]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:23.211 --> 02:20:24.812]  Look, I want to be a cheerleader for Trump.
[02:20:26.053 --> 02:20:27.054]  And the guy is awesome.
[02:20:27.534 --> 02:20:29.255]  I mean, he's really hitting his stride now.
[02:20:30.276 --> 02:20:34.258]  His work ethic, everything he's done, it's so focused, it's pragmatic.
[02:20:34.278 --> 02:20:35.799]  He's just the real deal.
[02:20:35.819 --> 02:20:36.400]  He's pro-human.
[02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:40.042]  I'm very honored to be persecuted alongside him with all of you.
[02:20:40.082 --> 02:20:44.685]  But Vox Dei, researcher, writer, smart guy to share with us.
[02:20:44.705 --> 02:20:48.808]  You see the Federal Reserve saying in Reuters, oh, we're going to stop the prosperity.
[02:20:48.828 --> 02:20:51.710]  We're going to raise interest rates really high to stop Trump.
[02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:52.871]  I mean, that's in Reuters here today.
[02:20:54.051 --> 02:20:58.232]  So we just have to realize that everyone should be totally behind Trump.
[02:20:58.412 --> 02:21:02.673]  China is working with the Vatican to dox real Catholics and kill them.
[02:21:03.273 --> 02:21:18.597]  And it's like the Pope's a good... I mean the stuff going on is so manifestly evil that the fact that we're barely winning right now shows the idea that the West projects its own superiority and culture onto everything else.
[02:21:19.673 --> 02:21:22.874]  And then we sit here, and then meanwhile, it's not superior.
[02:21:22.934 --> 02:21:24.515]  That's why people all want to come here.
[02:21:24.915 --> 02:21:28.116]  And I'm not putting anybody down, but those cultures never ignited the way we did.
[02:21:28.796 --> 02:21:30.917]  And you get into debates about, well, you're cave people.
[02:21:31.017 --> 02:21:31.497]  I don't care.
[02:21:31.537 --> 02:21:32.277]  I love everybody.
[02:21:32.437 --> 02:21:33.317]  I want freedom.
[02:21:33.717 --> 02:21:35.438]  There are great people in every culture, every region.
[02:21:35.798 --> 02:21:41.220]  The point is, the globalists are at war with the West because it's where the Christians said we're not going to have slavery.
[02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:43.060]  It's where women got the right to vote.
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:47.822]  So the authoritarians can't beat that, so they flip it and create all these twisted rights.
[02:21:48.522 --> 02:21:50.443]  It's in their own admissions they're totally wicked.
[02:21:50.463 --> 02:21:53.465]  So Vox, I want to give you some positive news here.
[02:21:54.766 --> 02:22:02.511]  But first, long term prognosis of why you're saying that the weakness of humanity and the sinful nature, I guess, at the end of the day.
[02:22:03.891 --> 02:22:05.753]  Let's look at the bad prognosis versus the good.
[02:22:05.813 --> 02:22:09.535]  And then in the short term, you're a proponent of a red wave.
[02:22:10.435 --> 02:22:13.877]  I believe it, unless the election fraud is just over the top as a seawall.
[02:22:14.278 --> 02:22:17.820]  So let's look at the bad long term, the good short term with Vox Day.
[02:22:19.656 --> 02:22:29.902]  The bad long term is that I would expect the USA to break apart as a political entity in the 2033 timeframe.
[02:22:31.503 --> 02:22:36.226]  And that's based on the economic situation.
[02:22:36.507 --> 02:22:39.789]  It's based on the average lifespan of currencies.
[02:22:41.029 --> 02:22:46.253]  And everything that I've seen, this is a prediction I made about 14 years ago, and
[02:22:48.735 --> 02:22:53.617]  Everything that I've seen indicates that it's on track.
[02:22:53.657 --> 02:22:54.998]  Oh, the globalists even plan that.
[02:22:55.298 --> 02:22:55.938]  But can't we?
[02:22:56.459 --> 02:22:57.399]  Let's just say it.
[02:22:57.779 --> 02:23:00.420]  We want freedom, but we're dealing with authoritarian outside forces.
[02:23:01.061 --> 02:23:11.846]  If we crack down, and we have to figure out the way to do that, culturally, to create a new level playing field, if we crack down on the tyranny and the outside forces, we could probably get around that.
[02:23:13.366 --> 02:23:16.708]  Yeah, there's a good chance, but the problem is that even
[02:23:17.973 --> 02:23:26.696]  As great and as insightful a leader as Donald Trump is not really looking at the real issues as far as I understand.
[02:23:28.456 --> 02:23:37.359]  You know, in Europe, there are leaders who are looking directly at the demographic issues, who are looking at
[02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:52.463]  Doing what they call reportations, which is returning a lot of the refugees and migrants and economic migrants and even citizens to their former countries.
[02:23:54.144 --> 02:23:58.044]  That's a whole debate that doesn't even exist in the United States.
[02:23:58.484 --> 02:24:05.146]  And I don't know that it can exist in the United States because of our historical
[02:24:06.189 --> 02:24:12.492]  Friendly attitude towards immigration and the fact that there's no strong nativist nationalist party in the states.
[02:24:12.812 --> 02:24:18.235]  And let's be clear, isn't it because Soros and the UN are weaponizing the third world that that is doomed to fail?
[02:24:18.415 --> 02:24:28.659]  A, then B, isn't Russia though, with their collapsing population, all their problems, the model, can they be successful realizing that this was an exterminism plan?
[02:24:29.019 --> 02:24:32.161]  Can the Russian model be successful and could it be duplicated?
[02:24:34.183 --> 02:24:35.703]  Yes, the Russian model.
[02:24:35.803 --> 02:24:38.604]  First of all, the Russian nation is not dying.
[02:24:39.644 --> 02:24:41.285]  The Russian nation is actually... I mean, under the globalists.
[02:24:41.305 --> 02:24:42.425]  Under the globalists, they wanted to.
[02:24:43.845 --> 02:24:45.066]  Oh, yeah, the globalists wanted to.
[02:24:45.466 --> 02:24:51.127]  But under Putin, the average lifespan in Russia has increased dramatically.
[02:24:51.927 --> 02:24:59.849]  And a strong pro-Christian, pro-nationalist government
[02:25:00.945 --> 02:25:03.006]  Can significantly change things.
[02:25:03.306 --> 02:25:15.931]  You know, a lot of people, when they talk about a nation dying, it's really ridiculous because if you look at how many people there are, there's far more people in every country than there's ever been.
[02:25:16.371 --> 02:25:25.334]  Britain ruled, you know, Britain established the empire in which the sun never set with far fewer white British people than they have today.
[02:25:25.374 --> 02:25:26.135]  Because they had will.
[02:25:28.018 --> 02:25:32.621]  Right, because they had will, and they had cultural confidence, and because they had hope, and they had faith.
[02:25:33.302 --> 02:25:39.926]  And we need to see a revival of muscular Christianity.
[02:25:40.087 --> 02:25:43.069]  We need to see a revival of national pride.
[02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:45.330]  Because if we don't, we will be conquered.
[02:25:45.350 --> 02:25:46.331]  That's the way the world works.
[02:25:47.372 --> 02:25:47.872]  Precisely.
[02:25:50.974 --> 02:25:54.397]  But you see the ignition of populism and Christianity happening again.
[02:25:55.653 --> 02:25:57.674]  And the pedophile-controlled Catholic Church in trouble.
[02:25:57.714 --> 02:25:59.435]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of really good signs, Fox.
[02:26:01.477 --> 02:26:02.537]  Well, there are good signs.
[02:26:02.957 --> 02:26:10.382]  But the problem is, what a lot of people don't seem to understand is that winning is going to involve conflict.
[02:26:11.483 --> 02:26:18.327]  And we've gone a long, long time in the United States without having to deal with war.
[02:26:19.850 --> 02:26:22.052]  Directly on our doorstep.
[02:26:22.712 --> 02:26:23.133]  And I agree.
[02:26:23.213 --> 02:26:30.959]  So let's if men aren't even willing to have politically correct people attack them or to be banned or to have them go up your bank account, you'll never stand up when the rubber meets the road.
[02:26:30.979 --> 02:26:34.702]  So what's your message to men about how we wage war against globalism now?
[02:26:36.903 --> 02:26:40.766]  I think the most important thing is to not be afraid.
[02:26:42.107 --> 02:26:42.387]  You know.
[02:26:44.049 --> 02:26:46.771]  My grandfather volunteered
[02:26:47.697 --> 02:26:48.177]  For the U.S.
[02:26:48.197 --> 02:26:50.338]  Marines the day after Pearl Harbor.
[02:26:51.519 --> 02:27:08.689]  And one thing he told me was that when you're on a beach and there's a bunch of people shooting at you and everybody looks at you to see what to do, he said, just do something.
[02:27:09.369 --> 02:27:11.950]  He said, it doesn't even matter what.
[02:27:12.711 --> 02:27:16.273]  Pick something, do it, and the next thing you know,
[02:27:17.388 --> 02:27:19.369]  30 men will be right there behind you.
[02:27:19.769 --> 02:27:20.189]  Exactly!
[02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.890]  Take action!
[02:27:22.891 --> 02:27:27.753]  And it doesn't necessarily... ...or action is.
[02:27:28.493 --> 02:27:36.117]  The idea that, you know, sitting around playing armchair strategist is somehow going to change the world is ridiculous.
[02:27:36.835 --> 02:27:41.598]  What changes the world is people acting, people doing things.
[02:27:42.178 --> 02:27:45.380]  And I totally agree because your conscious brain doesn't know what to do.
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:46.480]  Your subconscious does.
[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:52.263]  And once you go into action, you're going to find that some of the most directed action you'll ever have is when you're not even thinking.
[02:27:53.664 --> 02:27:58.767]  Well, not only that, but, you know, if something works, then you reinforce success.
[02:27:59.287 --> 02:28:01.989]  If something doesn't work, then you do something else.
[02:28:02.249 --> 02:28:03.429]  It's not rocket science.
[02:28:04.650 --> 02:28:06.071]  But but unfortunately,
[02:28:07.102 --> 02:28:18.526]  We're so used to abstracting things and trying to plan things and trying to figure out all the possible alternatives, which is not possible, that we tend to paralyze ourselves.
[02:28:18.566 --> 02:28:19.286]  No, I totally agree.
[02:28:19.306 --> 02:28:20.607]  Get out of the catatonic state.
[02:28:20.807 --> 02:28:21.147]  Move.
[02:28:22.027 --> 02:28:22.368]  Move.
[02:28:22.848 --> 02:28:23.548]  That's the answer.
[02:28:24.929 --> 02:28:25.909]  Yeah, and so, you know,
[02:28:27.172 --> 02:28:31.433]  You get shut down by Twitter, go on to Gab, go on to OneWay.
[02:28:32.093 --> 02:28:34.734]  You get shut down by YouTube, go on to BitChute.
[02:28:35.894 --> 02:28:40.115]  You get shut down by PayPal, talk to Stripe, create your own payment processor.
[02:28:40.415 --> 02:28:41.475]  Just do something.
[02:28:41.955 --> 02:28:49.977]  And go back to YouTube under pen names or whatever you have to, and then go protest at YouTube, and then sue YouTube, and sue PayPal, and other things that are coming.
[02:28:49.997 --> 02:28:51.197]  We'll be right back with Vox Day.
[02:28:51.237 --> 02:28:51.697]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.759 --> 02:28:58.800]  Let's go to MAGA Titan.
[02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:00.421]  Sorry, I cut you short here, MAGA Titan.
[02:29:00.441 --> 02:29:01.382]  You got 60 seconds.
[02:29:01.422 --> 02:29:01.742]  Go ahead.
[02:29:01.782 --> 02:29:04.604]  There's a war for your mind, and I just can't take it.
[02:29:04.664 --> 02:29:07.326]  Yelling at my phone, trying to break through this matrix.
[02:29:07.647 --> 02:29:10.249]  Thinking how to break through, cause we're all sedated.
[02:29:10.489 --> 02:29:11.790]  America's under attack.
[02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:12.871]  Can we debate it?
[02:29:13.451 --> 02:29:15.874]  They're trying to censor humanity's great awakening.
[02:29:15.914 --> 02:29:18.536]  The calm before the storm, we concede to the population.
[02:29:18.756 --> 02:29:20.718]  The mind control and the manipulation.
[02:29:20.838 --> 02:29:25.083]  They're lying to the TV of your favorite station, just so they can get paid off the death of a nation.
[02:29:25.123 --> 02:29:27.705]  But this is the rebirth, and you heard it from Jones first.
[02:29:27.805 --> 02:29:30.288]  Feeling like Indiana Jones with a cold curse.
[02:29:30.908 --> 02:29:31.569]  That's MAGA Titan.
[02:29:31.589 --> 02:29:32.970]  I tell ya, if anyone deserves a bullhorn...
[02:29:54.185 --> 02:30:02.433]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:02.613 --> 02:30:03.854]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:04.074 --> 02:30:08.398]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:08.819 --> 02:30:11.882]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:30:12.382 --> 02:30:13.844]  I still have that energy.
[02:30:14.064 --> 02:30:34.322]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:30:34.802 --> 02:30:38.585]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:30:38.825 --> 02:30:42.248]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:30:42.508 --> 02:30:47.031]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:30:47.552 --> 02:30:49.553]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:30:50.274 --> 02:30:52.896]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:54.212 --> 02:30:57.653]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:30:58.173 --> 02:31:00.914]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:31:01.455 --> 02:31:07.257]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:31:07.717 --> 02:31:10.498]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:31:11.238 --> 02:31:14.680]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:21.122]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:31:21.523 --> 02:31:26.485]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:31:27.239 --> 02:31:29.399]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:31:29.419 --> 02:31:29.780]  Go ahead.
[02:31:56.641 --> 02:31:58.742]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:31:58.762 --> 02:32:01.784]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:32:02.625 --> 02:32:03.705]  It just gets old, man.
[02:32:04.046 --> 02:32:05.767]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:32:06.487 --> 02:32:08.548]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:32:08.809 --> 02:32:12.811]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:32:12.831 --> 02:32:15.292]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:32:16.113 --> 02:32:18.434]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:32:18.454 --> 02:32:19.915]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:32:20.155 --> 02:32:21.036]  Us being shut down?
[02:32:21.276 --> 02:32:22.317]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:32:22.757 --> 02:32:23.778]  You know what, Alex?
[02:32:23.838 --> 02:32:24.898]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:32:24.918 --> 02:32:25.759]  Hey, Frank!
[02:32:26.019 --> 02:32:31.382]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:32:31.703 --> 02:32:35.965]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:32:36.205 --> 02:32:39.067]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:32:39.087 --> 02:32:39.728]  Do you understand?
[02:32:39.808 --> 02:32:41.088]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:41.449 --> 02:32:42.609]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:43.570 --> 02:32:48.493]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[02:32:49.474 --> 02:32:50.154]  Do you understand?
[02:32:50.174 --> 02:32:51.335]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:57.555 --> 02:33:00.337]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:05.479 --> 02:33:06.060]  We've got it.
[02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:12.543]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:12.623 --> 02:33:14.724]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:17.005 --> 02:33:22.608]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:24.851 --> 02:33:33.557]  So, Twitter has banned everybody from myself to James Woods to you name it for what they claim is racist or hateful or aggressive or demeaning.
[02:33:33.977 --> 02:33:35.618]  Now they say dehumanizing.
[02:33:35.658 --> 02:33:52.569]  But there are stories up on Infowars.com that show the Antifa group that's been doxing Gavin McGinnis and, you know, saying terrible things about him and his family and how they're gonna kill him and say they're gonna kill the vice president and doing all these other horrible things and chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants with his wife.
[02:33:54.284 --> 02:34:00.026]  They are all over Twitter calling for violence, but they get to stay up.
[02:34:00.787 --> 02:34:04.628]  But now a new nebulous term, ban dehumanizing speech.
[02:34:05.849 --> 02:34:09.831]  Major hospitals are refusing to call newborn baby boys and girls, boys and girls.
[02:34:10.751 --> 02:34:11.771]  That's dehumanizing.
[02:34:13.152 --> 02:34:16.753]  Attacking the very biological foundation of the species.
[02:34:17.514 --> 02:34:18.854]  Attacking reality itself.
[02:34:21.455 --> 02:34:22.516]  But oh, don't worry, Jack.
[02:34:23.649 --> 02:34:28.394]  Dorsey's going to ban what they call dehumanizing and leave people up.
[02:34:29.115 --> 02:34:37.364]  I mean, I've got an article here about this MSNBC host attacking some white lady saying that she was saying racist things she didn't and saying, I want to kill you.
[02:34:37.805 --> 02:34:38.726]  You're a piece of crap.
[02:34:38.846 --> 02:34:39.687]  You should be murdered.
[02:34:40.408 --> 02:34:41.168]  Twitter leaves that up.
[02:34:42.259 --> 02:34:43.860]  So, it's the craziest stuff.
[02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:48.083]  If I run into a CNN reporter who's been lobbying to have me banned, and I go, how dare you?
[02:34:48.343 --> 02:34:49.384]  You're a modern book burner.
[02:34:49.404 --> 02:34:50.384]  That is so disgusting.
[02:34:50.685 --> 02:34:54.867]  In a public place, he's a man I'm banned for attacking a protected group.
[02:34:54.907 --> 02:34:57.849]  Now, journalists, oh, they can lie about the president all day.
[02:34:57.869 --> 02:34:58.650]  He calls them liars.
[02:34:58.910 --> 02:35:00.491]  That's attacking the press and free speech.
[02:35:00.551 --> 02:35:00.731]  No.
[02:35:01.151 --> 02:35:05.394]  Countering liars and saying you're liars is free speech.
[02:35:06.114 --> 02:35:06.875]  But that's the spin.
[02:35:07.035 --> 02:35:07.976]  Oh, I've got free speech.
[02:35:08.556 --> 02:35:09.457]  Don't restrict my speech.
[02:35:09.497 --> 02:35:12.280]  The left means don't disagree with me while I hit you over the head with a bike lock.
[02:35:14.301 --> 02:35:16.543]  We sell the first four installments.
[02:35:16.604 --> 02:35:17.504]  Two more are coming out.
[02:35:18.005 --> 02:35:19.566]  We have sold out, I think, twice of these.
[02:35:20.007 --> 02:35:21.028]  So it's very, very popular.
[02:35:21.068 --> 02:35:24.010]  It's great for your children, great for your teenagers, great for you.
[02:35:25.432 --> 02:35:26.312]  Really great artwork.
[02:35:26.773 --> 02:35:30.777]  And it also shows women very, very empowered, but also very, very feminine, that they don't look like men.
[02:35:32.057 --> 02:35:34.099]  Alt Hero, number one, Crackdown.
[02:35:34.959 --> 02:35:37.681]  We've got Alt Hero, number two, Rebel Cell.
[02:35:38.362 --> 02:35:39.563]  Number three, Reprisal.
[02:35:39.703 --> 02:35:41.884]  Number four, The War in Paris.
[02:35:42.285 --> 02:35:43.946]  They're all available at infowarestore.com.
[02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:47.251]  I'm sure they'll sell out in a couple of days.
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:04.301]  Have been proven to work.
[02:36:04.321 --> 02:36:16.927]  So the fact that we finally show up shows what we're winning Let's talk about the comic books and why it upsets the establishment because no one dared have nationalistic or patriotic or common-sense Comics so surprise surprise.
[02:36:17.347 --> 02:36:28.973]  They're already bestsellers and what type of opposition have you run into and then let's get more into the red wave Well right now there's a tremendous amount of attack on
[02:36:29.742 --> 02:36:34.965]  on right-wing, and not really even right-wing, they're basically moderates.
[02:36:35.586 --> 02:36:45.032]  But in the comics industry terms, the comic industry is so far left that they consider these guys, you know, to be hard, hard extremist right, which is rather amusing.
[02:36:46.933 --> 02:36:52.857]  But Marvel and DC have continued to move to the left.
[02:36:53.617 --> 02:36:57.700]  And so they're pushing things like transgenderism in Batgirl,
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:02.903]  They're pushing homosexuality in a number of different comics and so forth.
[02:37:03.564 --> 02:37:12.429]  And so people have reacted really badly to this because they're actually eliminating and destroying a lot of the old characters that people liked.
[02:37:12.810 --> 02:37:15.752]  You know, Wolverine's replaced by a girl.
[02:37:16.672 --> 02:37:18.373]  Thor is replaced by a woman.
[02:37:18.974 --> 02:37:22.196]  Spider-Man's replaced by a gay Hispanic kid.
[02:37:22.216 --> 02:37:26.539]  It's just, and they're bringing in all kinds of
[02:37:27.449 --> 02:37:29.952]  Anti-American messages intentionally.
[02:37:30.612 --> 02:37:42.123]  In fact, the incredible thing is that the vice president, Marvel's vice president of content creation, is actually Huma Abedin's cousin.
[02:37:43.825 --> 02:37:48.409]  And so, you know, that's a connection you never see them drawing in the media.
[02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:51.873]  And what's interesting is that
[02:37:52.392 --> 02:38:05.477]  The fans are revolting against this, and so if you go on to places like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, you can see that these independent comics are exploding in popularity.
[02:38:06.638 --> 02:38:11.060]  There's one guy, we don't get along terribly well, but he's been extremely successful.
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:19.163]  A former DC artist named Ethan VanSkyver, his Indiegogo campaign raised over $500,000.
[02:38:22.481 --> 02:38:26.582]  It's because people are so tired of the orthodoxy.
[02:38:26.622 --> 02:38:28.083]  It's not even left or right.
[02:38:28.143 --> 02:38:28.903]  And here's the deal.
[02:38:29.423 --> 02:38:33.744]  You want your kids to have comic books where it's not, it wouldn't all be about sex anyways.
[02:38:33.764 --> 02:38:35.025]  You don't want to sexualize children.
[02:38:35.645 --> 02:38:42.307]  It's like I was reading an article today about another library and the adult section is having drag queens there to pole dance for children.
[02:38:42.867 --> 02:38:44.087]  They're like, oh, you're against drag queens.
[02:38:44.187 --> 02:38:45.748]  I'm against sexualizing children.
[02:38:46.048 --> 02:38:49.348]  But oh, as long as it's LBGT, it's OK to do this to kids.
[02:38:49.768 --> 02:38:53.309]  And literally, it's recruiting kids into that, which is pedophilia.
[02:38:53.389 --> 02:38:56.470]  I mean, it's just amazing to see this happening.
[02:38:56.750 --> 02:39:01.931]  So continuing, tell us about Alt-Hero, because I know they've been a big success so far.
[02:39:01.951 --> 02:39:12.413]  Yeah, Alt-Hero is a series that is designed to portray the battle between
[02:39:13.394 --> 02:39:16.756]  The Globalist and the Nationalist Perspectives.
[02:39:17.296 --> 02:39:28.662]  Now, a lot of people were very surprised when they read it because they were expecting some sort of polemic or screed or polar opposite of what you get from Marvel or DC.
[02:39:29.142 --> 02:39:30.003]  But we didn't do that.
[02:39:30.163 --> 02:39:33.204]  And we don't do that because you can't tell a good story that way.
[02:39:33.725 --> 02:39:42.249]  The only way that you can tell a good story is by allowing the characters and the perspective to speak honestly for itself.
[02:39:42.862 --> 02:40:05.996]  So, for example, Captain Europa, who's the EU superhero who's on the cover of The War in Paris, some of his dialogue is actually words that were spoken by Emmanuel Macron, the current president of France, who is, of course, very strong pro-EU, very much a globalist and that sort of thing.
[02:40:06.316 --> 02:40:09.618]  You cannot engage in an honest debate
[02:40:10.524 --> 02:40:14.547]  If you do not present both sides accurately and honestly.
[02:40:15.047 --> 02:40:28.335]  Now, there's obviously no question about which side I'm on, but the ironic fact is, we present a better and more honest argument for globalism than most of the globalists do.
[02:40:28.595 --> 02:40:37.061]  Because, you know, they're not willing to speak openly about what it is that they want to do, and why they want to do it, and why they believe that's the right thing.
[02:40:37.719 --> 02:40:37.980]  Thank you.
[02:40:47.133 --> 02:40:48.153]  Well, but that's their cover.
[02:40:48.193 --> 02:40:51.615]  Like, Emperor Palpatine says, I want total tyranny, so we'll have peace.
[02:40:52.155 --> 02:40:56.036]  I mean, that's the sick argument, is there's no free will, there'll be peace.
[02:40:56.056 --> 02:40:58.237]  But these people, I've found, are very, very monstrous.
[02:40:58.537 --> 02:41:07.840]  And you also are, you know, courting SPLC demonization by one of your characters sports the Confederate battle flag.
[02:41:08.260 --> 02:41:09.581]  So tell us about that.
[02:41:11.061 --> 02:41:13.802]  Well, actually, in that case, we had to avoid doing that.
[02:41:15.289 --> 02:41:17.793]  It's acceptable to have the mask.
[02:41:19.034 --> 02:41:30.010]  Originally, we had her full outfit, like the Confederate flag, but because Amazon has a no-Confederate flag policy,
[02:41:31.033 --> 02:41:36.117]  If we wanted to allow it to be sold there, we had to, you know, you can see there, she's just wearing a black jacket.
[02:41:36.137 --> 02:41:45.963]  Which I understand why you do that, but now it's the okay symbol, now it's, they're just constantly, now a federal judge says, is America first racist?
[02:41:46.264 --> 02:41:47.264]  Maybe that should be banned.
[02:41:47.284 --> 02:41:48.305]  Here's a Bloomberg article.
[02:41:48.585 --> 02:41:52.708]  So you see how they just can keep adding new, like, don't say Alex Jones or you get banned.
[02:41:52.768 --> 02:41:53.589]  It just, it never ends.
[02:41:54.491 --> 02:41:55.272]  Oh, there's no question.
[02:41:55.312 --> 02:41:58.315]  But that's why we need to build our own platforms.
[02:41:58.915 --> 02:42:01.858]  That's why we need to go our own way.
[02:42:02.438 --> 02:42:14.289]  Because one of the problems with the conservative approach over the past 50 years is that it's been constant retreat, but trying to remain engaged.
[02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:16.751]  And there's no possible way to win there.
[02:42:16.992 --> 02:42:18.113]  You're not going to
[02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:22.191]  Beat Google while you're playing Google's game.
[02:42:22.231 --> 02:42:26.993]  You're not going to beat Google by appearing on YouTube.
[02:42:28.454 --> 02:42:29.374]  No, I totally agree.
[02:42:29.394 --> 02:42:32.575]  You only use those platforms to help drive people to your big platform.
[02:42:33.016 --> 02:42:33.736]  That's how you defeat them.
[02:42:33.776 --> 02:42:35.116]  Vox Day is our guest.
[02:42:35.537 --> 02:42:37.817]  We're in the middle of this 16-hour broadcast.
[02:42:37.877 --> 02:42:38.898]  It goes to midnight tonight.
[02:42:40.345 --> 02:42:42.408]  Stand with Trump, stand with him forward, stand with free speech.
[02:42:42.828 --> 02:42:47.595]  Whatever you do, listening on AM, FM, radio, TV, spread those links.
[02:42:47.675 --> 02:42:50.259]  I know I keep saying it, but you're the reason we're winning, folks.
[02:42:50.279 --> 02:42:50.960]  You're the reason.
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:52.422]  You're overriding the censors.
[02:42:56.352 --> 02:43:05.261]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:43:05.782 --> 02:43:16.813]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:43:17.173 --> 02:43:22.858]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.
[02:43:23.118 --> 02:43:34.407]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions, Patriot Blend coffees have a smooth, bold flavor with great depth to give you just what you need in the morning.
[02:43:34.607 --> 02:43:38.571]  You can even choose to start your morning healthier with the Immune Support Blend.

[02:43:56.727 --> 02:44:08.238]  I initially asked Jim Acosta about his support of the hashtag free press movement where essentially he's criticizing President Trump for criticizing the mainstream media.
[02:44:08.338 --> 02:44:20.409]  On the same time he's pushing hashtag free press, free journalism, he's advocating, CNN is advocating for Infowars to be banned and shut down off of social media platforms.
[02:44:20.769 --> 02:44:21.470]  So he can't
[02:44:21.810 --> 02:44:30.160]  I have a double standard there where he's advocating for free press and then at the same time he's campaigning for other news organizations to be censored.
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:33.704]  Hey Jim Acosta, what do you think about Alex Jones being banned?
[02:44:33.764 --> 02:44:35.626]  Is that okay?
[02:44:35.646 --> 02:44:37.248]  I don't really have a comment, I'm sorry.
[02:44:37.348 --> 02:44:41.233]  Well given that they had hashtag free press as a fellow journalist...
[02:44:42.594 --> 02:44:45.115]  Come on, I'm not going to do anything attacking.
[02:44:45.215 --> 02:44:49.638]  As a fellow journalist, you know, hashtag free press was trending.
[02:44:49.658 --> 02:44:51.579]  Are you concerned at all?
[02:44:51.599 --> 02:44:53.160]  I certainly support freedom of the press.
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:54.881]  I support freedom of speech.
[02:44:55.821 --> 02:44:59.883]  I certainly don't like what we've seen over the last couple of years.
[02:44:59.903 --> 02:45:02.265]  The president attacking the press.
[02:45:03.185 --> 02:45:15.914]  I think that that's really put a spotlight on the importance of a free press, and I think anybody who, you know, responsibly exercises that right to free speech, right of freedom of the press, that ought to be respected.
[02:45:16.294 --> 02:45:27.842]  You know, listen, everybody has a right to free speech, everybody has a right to freedom of the press, but I also think that you have to be responsible in exercising that right, and what you say, and what you print, what you publish, and what you report on.
[02:45:30.463 --> 02:45:36.287]  CNN was calling for Infowars to be banned, don't you think that's kind of hypocritical though?
[02:45:36.347 --> 02:45:41.071]  But don't you think as a federal news organization you shouldn't be calling for other news to be banned?
[02:45:41.211 --> 02:45:47.115]  We deal with the truth, we deal with the facts, and I would recommend that you guys do the same thing, in my personal opinion.
[02:45:47.155 --> 02:45:52.939]  But don't you think it's better to just counter people rather than ban them and censor them?
[02:45:53.599 --> 02:46:06.969]  Ma'am, I've answered your question, and I'm saying as respectful as I can that my sense of it is that we have to deal with the truth, we have to deal with the facts, and if you're in that space, if you're dealing with the truth and the facts, then you really have nothing to worry about.
[02:46:07.009 --> 02:46:09.371]  So are you okay with news being censored?
[02:46:09.391 --> 02:46:13.714]  You're okay with media organizations being censored online?
[02:46:13.814 --> 02:46:15.075]  You're okay with that?
[02:46:15.115 --> 02:46:17.677]  I mean, as a fellow journalist, that doesn't scare you?
[02:46:17.897 --> 02:46:18.678]  Ma'am, I didn't say that.
[02:46:18.698 --> 02:46:21.300]  Because what if the pendulum swings the other way, Jim?
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:23.821]  What if it swings the other way?
[02:46:23.901 --> 02:46:27.724]  You guys are calling fake news to other platforms!
[02:46:27.844 --> 02:46:28.404]  Remember that!
[02:46:28.605 --> 02:46:35.129]  Essentially, Jim Acosta noticed when he says, oh well, we can't compare CNN to InfoWars.
[02:46:35.429 --> 02:46:35.949]  You know what?
[02:46:36.390 --> 02:46:37.270]  Maybe we can't.
[02:46:37.390 --> 02:46:43.815]  Because InfoWars has not had to make nearly as many retractions for fake news as CNN.
[02:46:44.175 --> 02:46:51.600]  And in fact, Paul Joseph Watson, one of our star reporters, actually has 200,000 more followers on Twitter than Jim Acosta does.
[02:46:56.926 --> 02:46:59.549]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:25.683 --> 02:47:30.625]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:33.566 --> 02:47:35.107]  Alright, I'll answer my question from earlier.
[02:47:35.147 --> 02:47:37.328]  Vox did a pretty good job of it from another angle.
[02:47:38.468 --> 02:47:40.849]  They hate me because they hate you.
[02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:46.412]  And this is a broadcast where we can talk, we have all these great guests on, we have the callers, we have community.
[02:47:47.978 --> 02:47:49.819]  And I genuinely am not scared of them.
[02:47:49.979 --> 02:47:52.020]  I'm genuinely having fun fighting them.
[02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:55.062]  I'm genuinely getting stronger as they attack me.
[02:47:55.862 --> 02:47:57.223]  Even in some ways as I get weaker.
[02:47:57.343 --> 02:48:00.485]  And so that's what angers them because what Vox said is critical.
[02:48:02.025 --> 02:48:16.353]  If you want to understand authoritarians, devil worshippers, Alistair Crowley types, they're all backstabbing, lying, dishonorable, very alone people that all just virtue signal to each other and screw each other over all day long.
[02:48:17.876 --> 02:48:20.917]  And so our mere existence infuriates them.
[02:48:20.957 --> 02:48:31.160]  So they believe they can absorb us, kind of like Karankawa Indians, you know, would catch sailors, you know, Spanish sailors that crashed in Galveston 500 years ago and, you know, eat their livers or brains.
[02:48:31.180 --> 02:48:32.320]  They thought they were taking on their power.
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:33.860]  And it really is.
[02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:36.761]  Like, I see somebody with a great-looking wife and successful business.
[02:48:36.781 --> 02:48:38.002]  I think, man, that's a really great person.
[02:48:38.022 --> 02:48:39.042]  Our species is strong.
[02:48:39.682 --> 02:48:41.884]  You know, and somebody that stands up for what's right.
[02:48:41.984 --> 02:48:43.065]  You know, I admire them.
[02:48:43.666 --> 02:48:45.948]  Other people's strength or beauty doesn't make me feel small.
[02:48:46.508 --> 02:48:49.090]  I'm an individualist, but I feel this collective strength in them.
[02:48:49.491 --> 02:48:51.933]  Just like I see weakness and corruption, it makes me feel weak.
[02:48:52.413 --> 02:48:53.715]  Seeing strength makes me feel strong.
[02:48:53.735 --> 02:48:55.016]  I'm not a globalist.
[02:48:56.246 --> 02:48:57.688]  They love fluoride in your water.
[02:48:57.708 --> 02:49:00.451]  They love giving you a vaccine they know is going to give you a neurological disorder.
[02:49:01.272 --> 02:49:05.697]  There's all these big studies out, even today, about fluoride and vaccines causing brain damage.
[02:49:05.757 --> 02:49:07.479]  That's what they do.
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:10.903]  Because they hate themselves so much, they're projecting.
[02:49:12.816 --> 02:49:13.196]  Know this.
[02:49:13.296 --> 02:49:14.457]  We're living in epic times.
[02:49:14.497 --> 02:49:15.317]  We're on this planet.
[02:49:15.498 --> 02:49:16.858]  We're in one hell of an adventure.
[02:49:16.978 --> 02:49:20.580]  The real adventure is happening now in the real world, not on Netflix, you know, not whatever.
[02:49:20.641 --> 02:49:26.284]  But you see all entertainment being poisonous because it's global is controllable.
[02:49:26.344 --> 02:49:35.409]  Entertainment jacking into it from the other angle, like these comic books and InfoWareStore.com is a great way to get these and then donate them to the library.
[02:49:35.789 --> 02:49:36.950]  They'll get read hundreds of times.
[02:49:37.431 --> 02:49:40.234]  Get them and send them with your children to school to give away.
[02:49:40.914 --> 02:49:46.580]  This is really how you change the world, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why they're so horrified.
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:47.761]  And then separately...
[02:49:50.683 --> 02:49:53.907]  I mean, I really should be plugging every segment, because they're trying to financially shut us down.
[02:49:55.089 --> 02:49:55.950]  But you've been coming through.
[02:49:55.970 --> 02:49:57.191]  You've been buying a lot of products and things.
[02:49:57.211 --> 02:50:04.000]  They're trying to take our payment processors away right now, and that's the next level of tyrannies barring folks from the marketplace.
[02:50:04.140 --> 02:50:06.983]  They call us Nazis all day, but that's what the Nazis actually did.
[02:50:09.406 --> 02:50:17.536]  We do have X2, the best halogen out there, the good halogen, the best, purest iodine, and it is the last run of it, and it's still 25% off, so I haven't changed the special yet.
[02:50:17.576 --> 02:50:18.437]  That's going to end very soon.
[02:50:18.957 --> 02:50:24.844]  You've got Brain Force Plus, 20% more now on each bottle, great nootropic, very healthy, amazing, works great.
[02:50:25.264 --> 02:50:29.830]  So you get a lot of energy and stuff, but not, you know, the toxic side effects of it, or the crash.
[02:50:31.371 --> 02:50:33.232]  That's 40% off right now.
[02:50:33.252 --> 02:50:33.972]  That's a big special.
[02:50:33.992 --> 02:50:35.532]  We've got our great Vitamin B12.
[02:50:36.673 --> 02:50:38.293]  It's organic and really high quality.
[02:50:38.313 --> 02:50:38.813]  Secret 12.
[02:50:38.853 --> 02:50:41.274]  That is 40% off right now.
[02:50:41.294 --> 02:50:43.295]  And just a bunch of other products at Inforrestore.com.
[02:50:43.655 --> 02:50:49.556]  And if you go there and keep buying the products or sign up for auto ships, you don't have to forget for the coffee and the supplements, then cancel any time.
[02:50:49.577 --> 02:50:50.497]  You get an additional 10% off.
[02:50:50.577 --> 02:50:51.617]  You have Patriot Points.
[02:50:52.737 --> 02:50:53.578]  You can set up an account.
[02:50:54.318 --> 02:50:55.898]  When you order, just click, you want Patriot Points.
[02:50:55.918 --> 02:50:57.019]  It goes right in your account.
[02:50:57.479 --> 02:50:58.419]  Inforrestore.com.
[02:50:58.779 --> 02:51:00.860]  And there's just a lot of other things there that make it easy.
[02:51:02.153 --> 02:51:04.729]  To support this broadcast, because believe me, at the end of the day...
[02:51:05.689 --> 02:51:10.330]  I'm not worried about losing InfoWars, or whatever happens to me.
[02:51:10.570 --> 02:51:11.690]  I'm worried about them winning.
[02:51:12.310 --> 02:51:18.572]  And so, we need wind in our sails, we need gunpowder in our political cannons, and you're the ones that provide that.
[02:51:18.832 --> 02:51:20.852]  Like jets for bombing sorties.
[02:51:21.352 --> 02:51:23.033]  You're loading the fuel, you're loading the bombs.
[02:51:23.093 --> 02:51:25.973]  I mean, you're not beside us, you're at the heart of us.
[02:51:26.033 --> 02:51:28.994]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA2533139.
[02:51:29.014 --> 02:51:30.894]  So, Vox, in closing, we've got about six minutes left.
[02:51:34.955 --> 02:51:36.556]  I've been raising a lot of topics here.
[02:51:37.456 --> 02:51:38.597]  You got some of the red wave.
[02:51:38.777 --> 02:51:41.178]  Can you comment more on what you really think is going to happen with this election?
[02:51:41.738 --> 02:51:45.240]  And then just any other points, because I've been guiding the conversation you'd like to relay to folks.
[02:51:47.461 --> 02:51:52.163]  Well, to address the blue wave concept, I said from the beginning that it was ridiculous.
[02:51:52.964 --> 02:51:54.584]  I never bought it for a second.
[02:51:56.551 --> 02:52:01.174]  I have been predicting a Trump slide in 2020 for some time now.
[02:52:01.854 --> 02:52:12.079]  And you may recall that I was one of the very few observers who said that Trump was going to win the presidential election and never wavered from that from, I think, February 2015.
[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:23.165]  The reason that the Democrats are going to be very disappointed in the midterms is because the economy has been doing well.
[02:52:24.286 --> 02:52:25.647]  Donald Trump has
[02:52:26.582 --> 02:52:38.992]  Maintained enthusiasm among his supporters, even though he hasn't been as effective at either draining the swamp or building the wall as we would have liked him to be.
[02:52:39.012 --> 02:52:52.143]  You know, the biggest mistake that Trump has made, and I don't want to be too critical here because, like I said, he has proven himself so far to be the best president of the 20th century.
[02:52:52.283 --> 02:52:53.524]  He's facing total mutiny.
[02:52:55.857 --> 02:52:56.038]  Right.
[02:52:56.078 --> 02:53:00.163]  The biggest mistake that he's made is that he didn't watch his six.
[02:53:00.884 --> 02:53:03.788]  He didn't bring in... No, you're right.
[02:53:03.828 --> 02:53:06.532]  He should have brought in acolytes, not people out of the swamp.
[02:53:07.754 --> 02:53:08.214]  Exactly.
[02:53:08.234 --> 02:53:15.440]  You know, he got sucked into believing that he needed people with experience and people with credentials.
[02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:16.181]  He didn't.
[02:53:16.781 --> 02:53:23.346]  All he needed and all he needs are people who will do exactly what he tells them to do.
[02:53:23.947 --> 02:53:36.757]  And, you know, if I were advising him, I would suggest fire everybody and get a bunch of 25-year-old, hardcore, true-believing
[02:53:37.569 --> 02:53:38.211]  Loyalists.
[02:53:39.395 --> 02:53:43.308]  And they'll figure out how to do whatever it is they need to do to do their jobs.
[02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:48.754]  You know, they don't need to have been at the FBI for 30 years to know how to do their job.
[02:53:48.774 --> 02:53:49.254]  I agree.
[02:53:49.294 --> 02:53:49.915]  Look at Strzok.
[02:53:49.935 --> 02:53:51.076]  He's a total mental patient.
[02:53:51.116 --> 02:53:56.380]  You don't want to, and I get Trump wanted navigators, like you get, you know, a Native American group to take you Lewis and Clark across.
[02:53:56.780 --> 02:53:58.762]  He needs a few goblin guides here.
[02:53:59.182 --> 02:54:03.826]  But you just can't bring in all the swamp guys and think because you're sharing power, they're not going to backstab you.
[02:54:04.206 --> 02:54:10.732]  Their nature is that they're all creatures of their system, and so they're all complete backstabbers.
[02:54:12.128 --> 02:54:17.551]  Well, there's an old English television show that is very educational in this regard.
[02:54:17.871 --> 02:54:21.933]  It's called Yes Minister, and then it was called Yes Prime Minister was the follow-up.
[02:54:22.553 --> 02:54:39.382]  And the whole joke was that the elected officials had no power, and that the bureaucrats spent their entire time doing exactly whatever they thought best, and then convincing the minister that what they wanted to do was really his idea.
[02:54:39.941 --> 02:54:42.123]  And that he had no other choice but to do what they wanted.
[02:54:42.803 --> 02:54:44.444]  So, this is not a new concept.
[02:54:44.484 --> 02:54:47.146]  This is something that goes back decades.
[02:54:48.527 --> 02:54:53.711]  And so, unfortunately, we've seen the price of that.
[02:54:53.751 --> 02:54:55.192]  We've seen the problem with that.
[02:54:55.212 --> 02:55:01.998]  Totally arrogant nobodies in a culture of all sucking each other's tally-whackers.
[02:55:02.058 --> 02:55:02.958]  I mean, that's what they do.
[02:55:03.399 --> 02:55:06.421]  It's a sick, sick culture of sycophantic nobodies.
[02:55:07.955 --> 02:55:19.123]  But I actually think that it's normal in a bureaucracy to sort of ignore the elected official who's only going to be there for a period of time.
[02:55:19.783 --> 02:55:32.012]  And, you know, in some ways, it might have been better if he'd gone back to the Andrew Jackson system of spoils, where you bring in your loyalists, get rid of all the bureaucrats, and then you can, you know, get your agenda passed.
[02:55:32.132 --> 02:55:33.853]  So I think that
[02:55:35.554 --> 02:55:37.976]  What Trump needs to do is he needs to trust himself.
[02:55:38.656 --> 02:55:46.161]  And he needs to stop assuming that you can convince people and that you can negotiate and that sort of thing.
[02:55:46.201 --> 02:55:48.043]  He just needs people that will do exactly what he tells them to do.
[02:55:48.063 --> 02:55:50.924]  Oh, look how he threatened to release the secret documents and they all started groveling.
[02:55:51.405 --> 02:55:52.065]  I agree with you.
[02:55:52.866 --> 02:55:57.329]  What do you think the next 40 days they're going to try to pull to try to derail this?
[02:55:57.369 --> 02:56:02.272]  I mean, if Kavanaugh gets confirmed, which I think is going to happen, they are going to go into meltdown mode.
[02:56:04.186 --> 02:56:04.986]  Oh, there's no question.
[02:56:05.046 --> 02:56:12.629]  But I think that they're going to behave themselves to a certain extent because they genuinely believe in this mythical blue wave.
[02:56:13.269 --> 02:56:20.631]  And so they think that they're going to get a Democratic House and possibly a Democratic Senate and impeach him.
[02:56:21.531 --> 02:56:24.532]  And there is no chance in hell that that's going to happen.
[02:56:25.692 --> 02:56:26.453]  And I agree with you.
[02:56:26.473 --> 02:56:29.195]  So the insanity is going to continue to intensify.
[02:56:29.215 --> 02:56:31.537]  And I think that's our biggest hope.
[02:56:31.597 --> 02:56:38.543]  I'm not glad they're going to do it, but I think they're going to go so far that that will counterman normal political reshuffling.
[02:56:39.664 --> 02:56:44.728]  But I think their extremism, their bullying, will force the full realignment.
[02:56:45.548 --> 02:56:47.590]  I think the Democrats are our best ally.
[02:56:49.312 --> 02:56:50.212]  To a certain extent.
[02:56:50.272 --> 02:56:53.355]  But the problem on the Republican side is that
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:57:01.705]  They have not yet fully embraced the identity politics that they're going to have to embrace if they want to remain competitive.
[02:57:02.485 --> 02:57:15.995]  Running around anointing every black pseudo-conservative that you can find and immediately handing them a show on Fox or a congressional district isn't going to work.
[02:57:16.235 --> 02:57:16.996]  It's never worked.
[02:57:17.556 --> 02:57:20.258]  And so what they need to understand is that
[02:57:20.982 --> 02:57:23.424]  The people who are for you are for you.
[02:57:23.464 --> 02:57:24.606]  People who are not are not.
[02:57:24.706 --> 02:57:26.187]  And that's the way it's going to be.
[02:57:43.049 --> 02:57:49.296]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[02:57:49.336 --> 02:58:01.148]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[02:58:01.328 --> 02:58:07.250]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[02:58:07.310 --> 02:58:20.334]  Last month, the website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[02:58:20.574 --> 02:58:27.797]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, dealing a blow to when a founder, Alex Jones,
[02:58:28.177 --> 02:58:28.898]  And we're also standing up
[02:58:48.593 --> 02:58:51.294]  To social media censorship.
[02:58:51.334 --> 02:58:52.174]  That's the new thing.
[02:58:52.594 --> 02:58:56.735]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[02:58:56.755 --> 02:59:08.197]  PayPal on Thursday night informed InfoWars, which runs an online storefront that sells survival gear and herbal supplements, that it has 10 business days to find a new payment processor.
[02:59:08.337 --> 02:59:11.858]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[02:59:11.918 --> 02:59:12.278]  He's out.
[02:59:12.298 --> 02:59:15.879]  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.
[02:59:16.859 --> 02:59:17.959]  And you just can't do that.
[02:59:18.019 --> 02:59:28.823]  Jones hit back on his website saying the InfoWarsStore.com site had no political content, and the move emphasizes how the decision was a broader attack on the InfoWars platform.
[02:59:28.843 --> 02:59:39.606]  A PayPal spokesperson says, quote, we undertook an extensive review of the InfoWars sites and found instances that promoted hate, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, and bullying policies.
[02:59:45.515 --> 02:59:49.629]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:50.151 --> 02:59:51.436]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:11.508 --> 03:00:16.411]  Alright folks, Roger Stone's coming up in the next segment, and then we're going to continue on to midnight tonight.
[03:00:16.452 --> 03:00:19.173]  I'm going to be back tonight, basically 7 o'clock on.
[03:00:19.193 --> 03:00:26.759]  We've got a bunch of big guests joining us this evening, and we're just doing another live broadcast right up until midnight, defensive free speech.
[03:00:27.459 --> 03:00:28.740]  I'm not whining and complaining.
[03:00:28.780 --> 03:00:31.002]  I'm very, very thankful for all the listeners and things you've done.
[03:00:32.619 --> 03:00:48.466]  Because you understand we're all in the same boat together, but man, there are so many Islamic stabbing and mass truck attacks, a hundred people run into yesterday, and Islamic groups in Germany going and just shooting people in clubs, and it's insane.
[03:00:49.567 --> 03:00:56.990]  And I just look at the globalists doing this to America and Europe, and they're just destructive weirdos.
[03:00:57.010 --> 03:01:01.512]  But then you look at Alexander Soros and Obama, and then you realize
[03:01:03.157 --> 03:01:07.659]  Just the type of existential hatred they have for everybody.
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:27.990]  I mean, these are nasty, nasty, nasty people, chaos creators, who for whatever reason have this feeling that they're not part of America, so if they could conquer it and mess it up as bad as possible, that they would somehow be big boys then.
[03:01:29.505 --> 03:01:32.447]  And so that's the point people really have to get into.
[03:01:32.467 --> 03:01:33.248]  I mean, look at this headline.
[03:01:34.669 --> 03:01:38.311]  Driver runs into crowd of a hundred children and teachers in Sweden.
[03:01:39.732 --> 03:01:41.433]  And another truck attack in Germany.
[03:01:43.615 --> 03:01:45.196]  And it's like Sadiq Khan said two years ago.
[03:01:45.216 --> 03:01:49.059]  He goes, the Islamic mayor of London, he goes, you'll just get used to it.
[03:01:49.079 --> 03:01:49.999]  And it's kind of true.
[03:01:50.019 --> 03:01:52.321]  It's like, oh, a hundred acid attacks this week.
[03:01:52.541 --> 03:01:53.162]  Oh, no big deal.
[03:01:53.502 --> 03:01:55.503]  Oh, another big Islamic child kidnapping ring.
[03:01:55.603 --> 03:01:56.224]  Oh, no big deal.
[03:01:57.245 --> 03:01:57.766]  Oh, no big deal.
[03:01:58.606 --> 03:02:00.929]  Just a driver runs into a crowd of 100 children and teachers.
[03:02:01.289 --> 03:02:02.290]  Yeah, no big deal.
[03:02:02.310 --> 03:02:02.971]  It's no big deal.
[03:02:03.712 --> 03:02:09.998]  MSNBC anchor Joy Reed sued for inciting hate mob against a refugee woman.
[03:02:10.598 --> 03:02:15.023]  Will the media report about the harassment mob formed by someone on their side?
[03:02:15.664 --> 03:02:19.848]  And then I didn't know that Joy Reed put this out against some lady she called racist with no proof.
[03:02:21.946 --> 03:02:22.907]  You are a disgrace.
[03:02:23.047 --> 03:02:26.669]  I wish your children were ripped from you so you would understand the pain.
[03:02:27.390 --> 03:02:29.291]  You are a dirty white woman bitch.
[03:02:30.392 --> 03:02:31.652]  Dear racist bitch.
[03:02:32.213 --> 03:02:35.395]  It seems like your old poor evil soul never left the Hitler era.
[03:02:36.135 --> 03:02:36.976]  You're funded by Soros.
[03:02:37.576 --> 03:02:38.297]  What a waste.
[03:02:38.377 --> 03:02:39.137]  What an embarrassment.
[03:02:39.478 --> 03:02:43.400]  What a disgrace of humankind to have people like you in the world.
[03:02:43.700 --> 03:02:44.621]  She doesn't want open borders.
[03:02:45.381 --> 03:02:48.543]  You're the kind of white trash that should be dragged to the town square and flogged.
[03:02:49.284 --> 03:02:50.645]  I'm sure you like Islam then, lady.
[03:02:51.786 --> 03:02:53.027]  Your tongue should be cut out.
[03:02:53.648 --> 03:02:54.368]  Leave this country.
[03:02:54.408 --> 03:02:55.589]  You're an absolute disgrace.
[03:02:56.049 --> 03:03:02.735]  I'm glad everyone in the entire world knows you're a racist piece of, you know what, you effing... It goes on.
[03:03:04.877 --> 03:03:05.297]  Worn out?
[03:03:05.417 --> 03:03:09.240]  Your life is probably becoming a living hell and you don't know how to handle it.
[03:03:09.580 --> 03:03:10.581]  I can offer a way out.
[03:03:11.382 --> 03:03:12.343]  You're a worthless human being.
[03:03:12.363 --> 03:03:12.963]  Go kill yourself.
[03:03:13.764 --> 03:03:20.309]  The best way to make America great again is to tar and feather sluts like you and ride the mount of the country on a rail.
[03:03:20.349 --> 03:03:21.470]  She's still on Twitter, by the way.
[03:03:23.007 --> 03:03:23.708]  It goes on here.
[03:03:24.949 --> 03:03:27.732]  She says, racist, you know what?
[03:03:29.053 --> 03:03:30.474]  Who the F do you think you are?
[03:03:31.275 --> 03:03:35.720]  You are sick and twisted, female genitalia, and you'll end up in hell.
[03:03:37.503 --> 03:03:44.869]  You're a disgusting human being, and if it wasn't for your voicemail being full, you would hear... I can't read any more of this, how she's going to kill her and everything.
[03:03:46.851 --> 03:03:54.238]  They let the group that attacked Ted Cruz and his wife, who says kill the president, kill Pence, kill police officers, they let them operate on Twitter.
[03:03:54.738 --> 03:03:56.340]  But I can't, which is fine.
[03:03:58.441 --> 03:04:03.206]  But Jack Dorsey and all these people are a psychotic cult that
[03:04:04.329 --> 03:04:19.019]  Are raping the Bill of Rights, raping the Constitution, funding all these radical groups, and of course they've got a pack, a slew, you know, a whole line of women ready to come out and say whatever they want about Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:04:20.861 --> 03:04:28.566]  The truth is, everything they say about Brett Kavanaugh is what Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have been caught involved in, certified, not 35 years ago, but recently.
[03:04:30.538 --> 03:04:33.760]  We'll get Roger Stone's take on, will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed?
[03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:34.661]  I think he will.
[03:04:36.282 --> 03:04:46.409]  And I predicted, you know, like in the Christmas story, that you would have three more accusers after Ford, leading up to the hearings and confirmation.
[03:04:46.869 --> 03:04:48.990]  And I've been proven absolutely untargeted.
[03:04:50.071 --> 03:04:50.972]  But now it may be worse.
[03:04:51.012 --> 03:04:52.713]  Maybe five million women will go public.
[03:04:54.964 --> 03:05:04.567]  Just a month ago, that Nazi collaborator, anti-American, gun-grabbing, anti-Christian piece of filth, George Soros, bought an even bigger interest in PayPal.
[03:05:05.708 --> 03:05:10.810]  But sure enough, they just told us today that we're going to be banned in 10 days because we're hateful.
[03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:14.231]  Because we don't support radical Islam and open borders and the rest of it.
[03:05:15.638 --> 03:05:21.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, now more than ever, you supporting InfoWars is changing the world.
[03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:25.441]  And yeah, they're getting rid of PayPal, but we have other ways to process your credit cards.
[03:05:25.941 --> 03:05:31.983]  Your financial support of us is literally buying war bonds in the 21st century war for humanity.
[03:05:32.023 --> 03:05:33.263]  So I want to commend you.
[03:05:33.283 --> 03:05:34.323]  I want to thank you.
[03:05:34.363 --> 03:05:35.984]  We got great products you already need.
[03:05:37.372 --> 03:05:39.012]  But without you, they will win.
[03:05:39.653 --> 03:05:47.075]  And Soros and Obama and Hillary see the shutdown of Infowars as a referendum on breaking the American spirit.
[03:05:47.635 --> 03:05:49.195]  So let's not let these jerks do it.
[03:05:49.615 --> 03:05:51.596]  I'm committed to the end, but I want to win.
[03:05:51.916 --> 03:05:54.577]  So please support Infowars.com today.
[03:05:58.058 --> 03:06:00.398]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:00.738 --> 03:06:05.880]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:06:08.596 --> 03:06:23.900]  Alright, so what you've got is a bunch of appeasers and a bunch of soy beta males running around trying to go find minorities and tell them how much they hate white people and how white people are inherently evil and how Christians are inherently evil.
[03:06:25.241 --> 03:06:29.982]  I played the clip yesterday of the Democrat Congresswoman saying, man, just shut up.
[03:06:30.022 --> 03:06:30.722]  You're all guilty.
[03:06:30.742 --> 03:06:31.363]  Just shut up.
[03:06:31.723 --> 03:06:36.384]  If a woman accuses you, you're guilty even if it's 36 years later and all your witnesses say it didn't happen.
[03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:44.924]  And so I was getting into MSNBC anchor Joy Reid, sued for inciting a hate mob, and I was actually reading quotes of her followers sitting in.
[03:06:45.624 --> 03:06:53.229]  The point she did is, she said the woman had harassed and done all these horrible things to a child and yelled racist things at someone, which wasn't true.
[03:06:53.249 --> 03:06:56.951]  And it just shows the insanity of all of this.
[03:06:57.451 --> 03:06:57.932]  So Roger,
[03:06:59.002 --> 03:07:03.588]  There's a lot to get to here today and you've got Michael Avenatti.
[03:07:03.608 --> 03:07:06.311]  I always call him Avenatti just to be both joking around.
[03:07:07.132 --> 03:07:13.901]  You've got him now with another woman, you know, saying that Brett Kavanaugh
[03:07:14.997 --> 03:07:15.858]  We're good to go.
[03:07:38.100 --> 03:07:39.141]  It may ruin my record.
[03:07:39.221 --> 03:07:40.522]  I think more will come out.
[03:07:40.882 --> 03:07:45.585]  I mean, hell, they may have a whole sports stadium of 100,000 women all saying, he gang raped me.
[03:07:46.105 --> 03:07:49.908]  You know, he abducted me with a flying saucer and took me up and did it.
[03:07:49.968 --> 03:07:51.289]  And we've got to believe it.
[03:07:52.037 --> 03:07:55.581]  So, I'm learning how we're all inherently bad, Roger.
[03:07:56.683 --> 03:08:06.915]  But Avenatti, or however you say his name, the gerbil, the human gerbil, he is here telling us how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:08:06.955 --> 03:08:10.920]  So, what's your inside baseball on Kavanaugh and where all this is going?
[03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:17.323]  Well Alex, your predictions have turned out to be exactly right.
[03:08:17.543 --> 03:08:25.567]  What's amazing here is, and I've been in American politics for almost 40 years, is this entirely new standard.
[03:08:26.227 --> 03:08:37.333]  It used to be that no major news outlet, not the Washington Post, the New York Times, CBS, anybody, would dignify an uncorroborated charge.
[03:08:37.393 --> 03:08:40.335]  Somebody who came forward and made an accusation but offered
[03:08:41.025 --> 03:08:45.788]  No eyewitnesses, no corroboration, no evidence, no proof.
[03:08:46.928 --> 03:08:50.790]  Can't say when it happened, where it happened, what year it happened.
[03:08:51.551 --> 03:09:01.796]  But because of identity politics, we're now told that any woman who makes a charge must be believed simply because they're a woman.
[03:09:02.658 --> 03:09:04.040]  This is an absurdity.
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:13.570]  Now, Alex, I'm old enough to remember the Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill hearings when Clarence Thomas was appointed to the U.S.
[03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:17.314]  Supreme Court by President George H.W.
[03:09:17.454 --> 03:09:17.814]  Bush.
[03:09:18.755 --> 03:09:23.020]  And you had very much the same hysteria around those hearings.
[03:09:23.835 --> 03:09:28.538]  Until Senator Arlen Specter subjected Ms.
[03:09:28.578 --> 03:09:33.781]  Hill to a withering cross-examination in the Senate hearings.
[03:09:34.381 --> 03:09:38.984]  By the way, they still teach that cross-examination in the law schools.
[03:09:39.144 --> 03:09:41.566]  It was so extraordinarily effective.
[03:09:42.206 --> 03:09:53.293]  What happened was, her credibility was shredded, Clarence Thomas was confirmed, and went on to be an outstanding Supreme Court Justice.
[03:09:54.068 --> 03:09:58.693]  Today, the Republicans in the Senate don't seem to have that kind of courage.
[03:09:59.374 --> 03:10:06.222]  They are, as I understand it, going to hide behind a woman prosecutor to do the questioning.
[03:10:07.208 --> 03:10:16.413]  Of a witness who again offers no proof or evidence of her charges other than her recently recovered memory.
[03:10:16.833 --> 03:10:19.815]  Well she says that Kavanaugh didn't even rape her.
[03:10:19.835 --> 03:10:25.738]  She's saying he was at the thing with the spiking of the punch and then girls had sex so that means gang raping.
[03:10:26.038 --> 03:10:30.281]  Meanwhile everybody else that knows Kavanaugh says dude Mr. Bookworm first in his class
[03:10:31.221 --> 03:10:55.111]  The dude was not at parties, or they were parties, they were like, you read his, it's so sad actually, in a cute way, I was reading his calendars that he even saved them, and it's like, getting ready for daddy's birthday, and then I've got a study to get an A+, and gee Wilbur, then I'm gonna have some milk toast in the morning, I mean this is just unbelievable, but I guess,
[03:10:55.891 --> 03:11:03.758]  I think a lot of these women actually have probably been abused or something, but they project it that, oh, all men are rapists, so for the greater good, they're going to remember this.
[03:11:03.818 --> 03:11:07.241]  Well, I can remember the Loch Ness Monster raped me, too, 36 years ago.
[03:11:08.843 --> 03:11:11.745]  Well, I think it's extraordinarily transparent.
[03:11:12.286 --> 03:11:19.993]  And then the irony of having Senator Richard Blumenthal on CNN last night with Anderson Cooper.
[03:11:20.766 --> 03:11:23.409]  Essentially calling Judge Kavanaugh a liar.
[03:11:23.549 --> 03:11:31.577]  Richard Blumenthal, a man who indisputably lied about serving in Vietnam, a country he never set foot in.
[03:11:32.017 --> 03:11:35.581]  A man who is a disgrace to the office of the U.S.
[03:11:35.641 --> 03:11:36.021]  Senate.
[03:11:36.542 --> 03:11:43.529]  A man who soils the memory of all those brave men and women who did give their life in that conflict.
[03:11:44.225 --> 03:11:49.231]  And then he has the cojones to sit there with a straight face and call somebody else a liar.
[03:12:00.965 --> 03:12:06.149]  Chosen Job represent rich pedophiles that rape little girls and she brags, I knew he was guilty, ha ha ha.
[03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:08.330]  He passed a lie detector showing me that didn't work.
[03:12:08.591 --> 03:12:09.851]  I knew he was guilty, ha ha ha.
[03:12:10.212 --> 03:12:14.955]  I mean, and the stealing the Haitian money and the child running and just all of it.
[03:12:15.035 --> 03:12:16.356]  And the Vatican and all the crap.
[03:12:16.376 --> 03:12:20.439]  And then meanwhile, you've got thousands of priests admittedly raping kids in the U.S.
[03:12:20.819 --> 03:12:21.900]  No one gets in trouble.
[03:12:22.521 --> 03:12:24.162]  And they say, oh, statute of limitations.
[03:12:24.442 --> 03:12:26.724]  It's only 15 years for child rape in Pennsylvania.
[03:12:27.404 --> 03:12:32.232]  And then meanwhile, 36 years, drunken parties, no proof, and it's the end of the frickin' world!
[03:12:32.532 --> 03:12:36.718]  These people, it'd be like Hitler at Nuremberg, sitting there as the main judge.
[03:12:37.039 --> 03:12:40.164]  It has no credibility because of who they are.
[03:12:41.514 --> 03:12:43.955]  And nobody seems to be willing to say that.
[03:12:44.075 --> 03:12:46.596]  That's the great irony here, Alex.
[03:12:47.737 --> 03:12:48.958]  This is a fraud.
[03:12:49.478 --> 03:13:07.366]  But if this is the new standard, then I have no doubt whatsoever that women are going to come forward shortly and say, although they have no proof, although they have no evidence, although they told no one, although they can't remember where and when it happened, I was sexually assaulted by Cory Booker.
[03:13:07.984 --> 03:13:11.247]  Or I was sexually assaulted by Eric Swalwell.
[03:13:14.350 --> 03:13:15.390]  Should they not be believed?
[03:13:15.451 --> 03:13:17.913]  Should they not be put on CNN to tell their story?
[03:13:18.233 --> 03:13:19.794]  Based on this standard, they should.
[03:13:20.195 --> 03:13:30.023]  What's the difference between such an accuser, and this is hypothetical, but what would be the difference between such an accuser and these women who come forward to malign Judge Kavanaugh?
[03:13:30.263 --> 03:13:31.724]  We're innocent until proven guilty.
[03:13:32.165 --> 03:13:33.065]  We're innocent until proven guilty.
[03:13:33.085 --> 03:13:35.287]  Let's play a few minutes of Clarence Thomas as we go to break.
[03:13:35.307 --> 03:13:39.270]  We're coming up with the president about this being a con game, but here's a few minutes of Clarence Thomas.
[03:13:41.732 --> 03:13:55.003]  Senator, I would like to start by saying unequivocally, uncategorically, that I deny each and every single allegation against me today that suggested in any way
[03:13:56.496 --> 03:14:05.058]  That I had conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with Anita Hill.
[03:14:05.918 --> 03:14:08.399]  That I ever attempted to date her.
[03:14:09.339 --> 03:14:14.080]  That I ever had any personal sexual interest in her.
[03:14:15.420 --> 03:14:18.221]  Or that I in any way ever harassed her.
[03:14:20.123 --> 03:14:22.665]  A second and I think more important point.
[03:14:23.686 --> 03:14:27.568]  I think that this today is a travesty.
[03:14:29.250 --> 03:14:30.791]  I think that it is disgusting.
[03:14:31.911 --> 03:14:38.716]  I think that this hearing should never occur in America.
[03:14:40.177 --> 03:14:44.741]  This is a case in which this sleaze, this dirt,
[03:14:45.936 --> 03:14:49.739]  Was searched for by staffers of members of this committee.
[03:14:52.501 --> 03:14:54.543]  Was then leaked to the media.
[03:14:56.705 --> 03:15:08.234]  And this committee and this body validated it and displayed it at prime time over our entire nation.
[03:15:09.194 --> 03:15:12.157]  How would any member on this committee
[03:15:13.357 --> 03:15:25.240]  Any person in this room or any person in this country would like sleaze said about him or her in this fashion.
[03:15:25.260 --> 03:15:31.222]  Or this dirt dredged up in this gossip and these lies displayed in this manner.
[03:15:31.502 --> 03:15:33.022]  How would any person like it?
[03:15:34.543 --> 03:15:36.643]  The Supreme Court is not worth it.
[03:15:37.924 --> 03:15:38.904]  No job is worth it.
[03:15:40.811 --> 03:15:41.772]  I'm not here for that.
[03:15:42.092 --> 03:15:48.376]  I'm here for my name, my family, my life, and my integrity.
[03:15:48.396 --> 03:15:50.017]  People smell the truth, don't they?
[03:15:50.057 --> 03:15:52.219]  Clarence Thomas didn't do a damn thing.
[03:15:53.880 --> 03:16:01.625]  Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens.
[03:16:02.325 --> 03:16:02.906]  Translation?
[03:16:03.735 --> 03:16:08.397]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[03:16:08.597 --> 03:16:16.920]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[03:16:16.940 --> 03:16:22.883]  A high rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting house or skipping airport security.
[03:16:23.143 --> 03:16:27.610]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[03:16:38.806 --> 03:16:41.487]  You know Google's really the C.I.N.
[03:17:04.431 --> 03:17:10.114]  But it's leftist run now, so it's brought over to China, and it's a civil war inside the intelligence agency.
[03:17:10.314 --> 03:17:18.717]  These are serious people plotting to finagle the searches, which is what Google sells to us as being fair and unbiased.
[03:17:18.877 --> 03:17:25.300]  Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any American election just by altering its search suggestions.
[03:17:25.721 --> 03:17:26.681]  We'd never know what happened.
[03:17:26.681 --> 03:17:36.210]  Well, Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:17:36.250 --> 03:17:38.012]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:17:38.092 --> 03:17:48.802]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, but it's officially moved its main operations for AI to China and is merging with the Chinese government, letting them have all the technology.
[03:17:48.962 --> 03:18:01.208]  So they're working on behalf of the fascist Chinese government, sending propaganda to its people to keep them under the control of the government, but we shouldn't worry about the fact that they have a chokehold on all human information in English.
[03:18:01.388 --> 03:18:01.988]  Not a big deal.
[03:18:02.689 --> 03:18:04.570]  I mean, that's a lot you just said there, but I...
[03:18:06.990 --> 03:18:13.292]  So Google always swears that its liberal, anti-Trump views of the top people doesn't affect the search product.
[03:18:13.792 --> 03:18:19.234]  But here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activist.
[03:18:19.254 --> 03:18:23.855]  The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily.
[03:18:24.235 --> 03:18:28.196]  They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps.
[03:18:28.596 --> 03:18:34.259]  But the legitimate election of President Trump somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values?
[03:18:34.839 --> 03:18:36.540]  Give me a break.
[03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:39.241]  Google was working to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[03:18:39.402 --> 03:18:50.827]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results, instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[03:18:50.947 --> 03:18:54.149]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary Clinton's leaked email.
[03:18:54.249 --> 03:18:59.873]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:25.169]  Working with big tech.
[03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:28.230]  You're not allowed to get the InfoWars official app on your iPhone.
[03:19:28.270 --> 03:19:33.391]  You're not allowed to watch the Alex Jones Show on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[03:19:34.171 --> 03:19:45.933]  But if you're the Chinese government and you want access to every citizen and all their data and everything they've ever done on an Apple product, good to go, baby.
[03:19:46.933 --> 03:19:47.513]  Good to go.
[03:19:48.253 --> 03:19:51.034]  And the left in America loves it.
[03:19:57.268 --> 03:20:08.734]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.696 --> 03:20:20.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.340 --> 03:20:25.062]  And Roger Stone riding shotgun with me in the middle of this special 16-hour global broadcast.
[03:20:25.542 --> 03:20:26.563]  Goes till midnight tonight.
[03:20:28.168 --> 03:20:32.550]  The fall of Venezuela has already happened, but the official fall is nigh.
[03:20:33.490 --> 03:20:37.032]  And Trump is weighing military intervention and getting South American backers.
[03:20:38.032 --> 03:20:42.574]  And I don't like military intervention, but this could collapse like dominoes.
[03:20:42.594 --> 03:20:44.935]  In fact, I need a set of dominoes in here.
[03:20:44.955 --> 03:20:49.097]  We need to buy some to explain that Venezuela is just like seven or eight countries down.
[03:20:51.458 --> 03:20:52.018]  Right to us.
[03:20:52.558 --> 03:20:54.599]  They've already, millions are exiting.
[03:20:54.659 --> 03:20:55.540]  It's a total collapse.
[03:20:56.829 --> 03:21:01.772]  And I think Alexandra Cortez should run down there because she says that's the model.
[03:21:03.113 --> 03:21:07.136]  And it's so beautiful, so wonderful how communism works.
[03:21:07.816 --> 03:21:10.198]  Going back to Roger Stone, Roger, you know the president well.
[03:21:10.818 --> 03:21:15.541]  And I just think suddenly he has more energy, he's more aggressive, he's more impromptu, he's on fire.
[03:21:15.561 --> 03:21:19.423]  We're going to play part of a five minute clip where he talks about the con game of going after Kavanaugh.
[03:21:20.544 --> 03:21:27.770]  To me, and him saying declassify stuff, they're trying to block it, but now, Rosenstein's saying he resigned, and he didn't, tomorrow.
[03:21:28.130 --> 03:21:37.658]  Seems like so much is happening this Thursday, and I just smell, and I see, and I get the signal that more and more Trump's doing what he wants to do, and that is scaring the living hell out of the globalists.
[03:21:39.517 --> 03:21:40.478]  I completely agree.
[03:21:40.518 --> 03:21:47.984]  The President seems to have a new bounce in his step, and the breaking news is all breaking his way.
[03:21:48.884 --> 03:22:03.195]  It's amazing how quickly those in the deep state rushed to dissuade him from declassifying the material surrounding the FISA warrants that were used to unconstitutionally spy on the President's campaign.
[03:22:03.656 --> 03:22:06.638]  That's right, Mr. President, it's time for sunshine.
[03:22:07.058 --> 03:22:09.300]  Sunshine is the disinfectant.
[03:22:10.153 --> 03:22:19.661]  These characters are so shady that they get the British to contact the President and say, Oh, Mr. President, you can't declassify this material.
[03:22:20.021 --> 03:22:24.105]  It would harm your national security and our international relationships.
[03:22:24.565 --> 03:22:30.850]  No, Mr. President, it'll prove that the British were spying on you at the behest of the Obama administration.
[03:22:31.230 --> 03:22:34.373]  Which you first broke, and Napolitano and I, we all broke it.
[03:22:34.513 --> 03:22:36.435]  And people go, that sounds crazy, why would a foreign power?
[03:22:36.475 --> 03:22:39.338]  Because we spout on the Brits illegally, they spout on us illegally.
[03:22:39.598 --> 03:22:41.900]  The Brits kill US citizens, we kill their citizens.
[03:22:42.261 --> 03:22:45.784]  That's well-known spycraft with the special relationship.
[03:22:47.248 --> 03:22:48.268]  That's exactly right.
[03:22:48.388 --> 03:22:53.749]  Also, Alex, I want to remind people tonight about our global marathon.
[03:22:53.769 --> 03:22:55.530]  We're going to be on right up until midnight.
[03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:57.850]  I'm going to be there doing my part.
[03:22:57.870 --> 03:23:04.171]  This is going to be very exciting as we continue to sound the clarion call for freedom, because there's a lot of good news.
[03:23:04.631 --> 03:23:13.213]  We now know, for example, according to the New York Post, that the president has an executive order demanding an investigation on the basis of antitrust.
[03:23:13.753 --> 03:23:20.618]  And by the way, I had law firms six weeks ago send those reports to the president through intermediaries.
[03:23:20.678 --> 03:23:22.479]  That's one reason we were banned.
[03:23:22.839 --> 03:23:24.940]  So next month's news today.
[03:23:24.980 --> 03:23:25.321]  Continue.
[03:23:36.582 --> 03:23:40.024]  This is, I think, the most important fight on the horizon.
[03:23:40.445 --> 03:23:46.009]  If there is no InfoWars, then there is no one to sound the clarion call for freedom.
[03:23:46.390 --> 03:23:57.439]  There is no one to put into perspective for people, for example, that the accusers of Brett Kavanaugh have no evidence, have no eyewitnesses, have no corroboration.
[03:23:57.779 --> 03:23:58.420]  Can't remember
[03:23:58.800 --> 03:23:59.521]  When it happened.
[03:23:59.561 --> 03:24:04.186]  Roger, if you said that I raped you 36 years ago with no proof, they'd laugh at you because we're men.
[03:24:04.286 --> 03:24:06.829]  Or if I said that, it's preposterous.
[03:24:07.330 --> 03:24:09.592]  Kavanaugh was a bookworm nerd.
[03:24:09.612 --> 03:24:13.096]  I mean, he has all the real witnesses.
[03:24:13.477 --> 03:24:18.082]  Everything they've done has fallen apart, but they keep leapfrogging to the next pile of crap.
[03:24:19.062 --> 03:24:34.971]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary because the politically correct nature of this MeToo movement means that if you're a woman, regardless of your lack of any evidence or proof, you must automatically be believed.
[03:24:35.432 --> 03:24:37.793]  That sets a dangerous new standard.
[03:24:37.933 --> 03:24:44.657]  And I know a number of Democrats who could be subjected to the same exact type of accusations.
[03:24:45.677 --> 03:24:46.358]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:24:49.637 --> 03:24:58.219]  I think they've crossed the Rubicon, and a lot of people are seeing this, where the Republicans are, we don't care if you have 100 women, but you can see the bandwagon, gang-up effect, it was easy to predict.
[03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:01.660]  We're done, this is a load of crap, we're gonna confirm him Friday.
[03:25:01.700 --> 03:25:04.341]  I mean, I think the Me Too thing has finally played out.
[03:25:04.701 --> 03:25:14.544]  Especially when it's led by the famous lawyer of pedophiles, Hillary, and her big, ugly, pedophile, crooked Johnson husband.
[03:25:16.570 --> 03:25:21.612]  Yeah, even the Democrats at this point probably wish that Hillary would just go away.
[03:25:21.672 --> 03:25:27.635]  The idea of Hillary Clinton coming out and saying, well, these women should be believed is ludicrous.
[03:25:28.135 --> 03:25:29.436]  What about Kathleen Willey?
[03:25:29.676 --> 03:25:31.197]  What about Juanita Broderick?
[03:25:31.517 --> 03:25:33.118]  What about Paula Jones?
[03:25:33.898 --> 03:25:37.840]  What about the numerous women sexually assaulted, bitten,
[03:25:39.312 --> 03:25:53.961]  And that's why I said that he has a crooked male genitals is that the women before it was ever in the news said it literally turns and points straight down towards hell his father.
[03:25:54.341 --> 03:25:58.343]  So Bill Clinton has a very large male genitals and they literally is deformed.
[03:25:58.363 --> 03:26:01.705]  I mean he has a crooked broken and that's how the women know.
[03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:09.844]  Yeah, the only thing I disagree about is I was under the impression from interviewing a number of his women victims that it was actually abnormally small.
[03:26:13.089 --> 03:26:13.409]  Yes.
[03:26:13.749 --> 03:26:38.086]  But you can go to the Clinton's War on Women, which is available at the Infowars.com store right now, to get the definitive story on Bill Clinton's serial sexual assaults against dozens of women, and more importantly, the role that Hillary plays in hiring the nasty private detectives and the vicious lawyers to bludgeon these women, to intimidate them, to bully them into silence.
[03:26:38.106 --> 03:26:40.568]  Let's be clear, some people got beaten half to death.
[03:26:41.932 --> 03:26:43.915]  There is no question.
[03:26:44.055 --> 03:26:49.383]  One witness was beaten so badly that even today he fears for his life.
[03:26:53.786 --> 03:26:59.772]  Yes, and the Jennifer Flowers relationship was actually a consensual relationship.
[03:27:00.192 --> 03:27:11.924]  This poor bastard's problem is that he made the mistake of setting up a security camera in the hallway because somebody had been vandalizing his automobile and what he caught was Bill Clinton coming and going.
[03:27:12.464 --> 03:27:21.007]  Then one day, three Arkansas State Troopers showed up and they beat this man so badly that they left him for dead.
[03:27:21.447 --> 03:27:23.428]  Fortunately, he survived.
[03:27:23.488 --> 03:27:34.311]  It's all there in the Clinton's War on Women, available at the Infowars.com store right now at a terrific price of $9.95, which is much less than you can buy it anywhere else.
[03:27:34.351 --> 03:27:35.892]  And folks, I know you already know all this.
[03:27:36.112 --> 03:27:38.834]  Get the book and give it to the library after you read it.
[03:27:39.154 --> 03:27:40.195]  This is how we win the war.
[03:27:40.235 --> 03:27:41.236]  About a hundred people read it.
[03:27:41.536 --> 03:27:42.336]  That's how we win.
[03:27:42.496 --> 03:27:43.157]  One mind at a time.
[03:27:43.177 --> 03:27:43.657]  We'll go to break.
[03:27:43.677 --> 03:27:44.438]  Come back with Roger Stone.
[03:27:44.458 --> 03:27:49.161]  I want to play some of Trump eloquently exposing this whole Kavanaugh situation.
[03:27:49.982 --> 03:27:54.425]  But listen, everything's game-changing at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:27:55.385 --> 03:28:01.329]  So yes, I don't keep extending for three, four days the sale on X2 because, you know, it's just, oh, it's our last day.
[03:28:01.349 --> 03:28:01.990]  It's our last day.
[03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:03.271]  I have been so busy on air.
[03:28:04.622 --> 03:28:11.417]  And so busy, like a one-legged man in a you-know-what contest, that I have just not launched all the other big specials that we will launch tomorrow.
[03:28:11.437 --> 03:28:12.519]  They were meant to be launched today.
[03:28:13.755 --> 03:28:15.456]  This is the last day to get X2.
[03:28:15.517 --> 03:28:16.778]  I've got to go do the specials right now.
[03:28:16.798 --> 03:28:20.140]  I'm going to shoot some ads for the new t-shirts, too, so you'll see it all tomorrow.
[03:28:20.160 --> 03:28:27.146]  But part of the new specials that they did get out, because I said this last week to the crew, was 40% off Brain Force Plus, great deal.
[03:28:27.166 --> 03:28:31.210]  40% off Secret 12, InfoWarsTore.com is the main site.
[03:28:31.250 --> 03:28:34.172]  InfoWarsLife.com is the supplements.
[03:28:34.192 --> 03:28:36.034]  40% off, 50% off SuperMetal Vitality.
[03:28:36.054 --> 03:28:37.054]  This is the last run of that.
[03:28:38.095 --> 03:28:38.796]  Biodruth Selenium, 40% off.
[03:28:40.277 --> 03:28:46.240]  Sign up for AutoShip, and yeah, even if the X2 sells out, we're gonna hold back for one more shipment.
[03:28:46.580 --> 03:28:49.021]  Whoever signed up for AutoShip, you'll get an additional 10% off.
[03:28:49.041 --> 03:28:52.203]  So that's one way to make sure you get the next front of X2 as well.
[03:28:53.334 --> 03:28:55.736]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years.
[03:28:55.796 --> 03:28:58.398]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[03:28:58.798 --> 03:29:04.102]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[03:29:04.122 --> 03:29:12.468]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[03:29:12.828 --> 03:29:17.752]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[03:29:18.292 --> 03:29:20.034]  Right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:20.074 --> 03:29:21.575]  Please support this network.
[03:29:26.412 --> 03:29:27.433]  He's The Amazing Lucas.
[03:29:27.633 --> 03:29:30.354]  Every one of his videos is really good, really informative.
[03:29:30.975 --> 03:29:34.436]  And he's a champion bodybuilder and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[03:29:35.017 --> 03:29:39.919]  And he's The Amazing Lucas on Instagram, at I'm The Amazing Lucas, YouTube The Amazing Lucas.
[03:29:39.999 --> 03:29:44.682]  And he just got involved in the last year or so because of all the stuff that he has seen.
[03:29:44.802 --> 03:29:45.842]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[03:29:46.002 --> 03:29:46.883]  Thank you for having me.
[03:29:47.503 --> 03:29:52.586]  Man, I tell you, what would you call the state of the nation right now?
[03:29:53.660 --> 03:29:54.321]  What would you call that?
[03:29:54.781 --> 03:29:57.544]  A hysterical, and it's manufactured hysteria.
[03:29:57.964 --> 03:29:58.925]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:29:59.586 --> 03:30:02.288]  Because everything from Maxine Waters, like, that's real.
[03:30:02.708 --> 03:30:11.337]  When it comes to the mob, the thing is, many people were focusing on what she was saying, but if you really go back in time, they've always been saying some off-the-wall things.
[03:30:11.457 --> 03:30:13.439]  The only difference is, now people are cheering.
[03:30:13.659 --> 03:30:18.663]  And once you have Tommy Loring and water thrown in her face, it's only a matter of time that water becomes acid.
[03:30:19.224 --> 03:30:20.025]  When do they stop her?
[03:30:20.085 --> 03:30:20.846]  How far does this go?
[03:30:21.166 --> 03:30:21.727]  They won't stop.
[03:30:21.747 --> 03:30:22.868]  They absolutely won't stop.
[03:30:22.888 --> 03:30:27.193]  Because what they won't allow to happen is a repeat of what happened in 2016.
[03:30:27.774 --> 03:30:29.436]  And I don't think a lot of people understand that.
[03:30:29.496 --> 03:30:32.579]  What we're seeing is just, it's the tipping point.
[03:30:33.160 --> 03:30:38.105]  And while they're figuring out and re-strategizing right now, this is a time that we need to consolidate.
[03:30:38.982 --> 03:30:39.302]  Absolutely.
[03:30:58.817 --> 03:31:01.119]  To steal the American dream, it's so cold-blooded.
[03:31:01.179 --> 03:31:01.819]  It absolutely is.
[03:31:01.899 --> 03:31:04.641]  The thing is, what the left touches, they destroy.
[03:31:04.701 --> 03:31:15.929]  And for people who don't believe that, you can look at the black community, everything from separating fathers with the welfare, to putting Planned Parenthoods in the communities, to presently right now, seeing voter IDs, it's racist, it's racist.
[03:31:16.009 --> 03:31:17.730]  It's like, we all know that's not the case.
[03:31:17.931 --> 03:31:19.191]  You want the votes from the legals.
[03:31:19.312 --> 03:31:25.056]  But what the frightening part is, what should be alarming to people right now, is that they have their eyes on America.
[03:31:25.376 --> 03:31:26.937]  That should be the frightening part, because guess what?
[03:31:26.937 --> 03:31:27.277]  You know what?
[03:31:27.297 --> 03:31:29.919]  That affects you, that affects me, that affects everyone.
[03:31:30.159 --> 03:31:32.340]  And that's why you need to pick up and fight.
[03:31:32.380 --> 03:31:34.561]  And I'm not saying incite the violence, but you need to fight.
[03:31:34.901 --> 03:31:38.163]  And you know, no pun intended, but it is an information war.
[03:31:38.343 --> 03:31:39.083]  And it's true!
[03:31:39.163 --> 03:31:42.445]  I mean, what you said is everything they touch turns to crap.
[03:31:42.585 --> 03:31:45.566]  Why in the world would we want these people running things?
[03:31:45.606 --> 03:31:49.729]  TheAmazingLucas, at IAmTheAmazingLucas on Twitter, be sure and follow him.
[03:31:53.048 --> 03:31:58.793]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[03:31:59.073 --> 03:32:03.097]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[03:32:03.557 --> 03:32:05.759]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[03:32:05.779 --> 03:32:07.920]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[03:32:08.261 --> 03:32:10.262]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[03:32:10.783 --> 03:32:11.023]  Boom!
[03:32:11.323 --> 03:32:13.565]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[03:32:13.905 --> 03:32:15.487]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[03:32:15.547 --> 03:32:17.348]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[03:32:17.408 --> 03:32:18.529]  You still have a shopfront.
[03:32:18.729 --> 03:32:19.530]  And then what do we see?
[03:32:19.810 --> 03:32:20.551]  Washington Post.
[03:32:21.091 --> 03:32:24.233]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%.
[03:32:25.594 --> 03:32:28.715]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[03:32:28.735 --> 03:32:31.557]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[03:32:31.877 --> 03:32:37.280]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:37.600 --> 03:32:42.103]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is.
[03:32:42.483 --> 03:32:43.684]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.977 --> 03:33:09.099]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:09.619 --> 03:33:14.844]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:33:17.086 --> 03:33:22.531]  Make ready to land our troops beyond the energy field and deploy the fleet so no one gets off the system.
[03:33:22.551 --> 03:33:27.895]  That's what the globalists want for America, but humanity is awakening.
[03:33:28.776 --> 03:33:30.538]  This is InfoWars.
[03:33:31.118 --> 03:33:32.660]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[03:33:34.497 --> 03:33:37.528]  Bloomberg has to admit Trump is right a year later.
[03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:40.498]  We don't want to invade Venezuela, but I meant...
[03:33:41.554 --> 03:33:44.697]  When I said it, that it's collapsing in a domino effect.
[03:33:44.777 --> 03:33:49.480]  And my memory did serve that Venezuela is seven countries south of us.
[03:33:49.921 --> 03:33:56.206]  Can we go to the Geospatial Center, also known as Google, and the CIA map, please?
[03:33:57.086 --> 03:33:57.827]  And there it is.
[03:33:57.907 --> 03:33:59.648]  Let's zoom in on the CIA map.
[03:34:00.549 --> 03:34:09.276]  There you see Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and then Venezuela.
[03:34:10.504 --> 03:34:12.305]  Is seven countries south of us.
[03:34:12.625 --> 03:34:14.827]  Five million people the last month have left.
[03:34:15.507 --> 03:34:16.908]  Tens of millions more are trying to leave.
[03:34:16.948 --> 03:34:23.573]  They put up emergency fences in Colombia and in other surrounding countries like Brazil.
[03:34:24.453 --> 03:34:32.239]  Even leftist governments have declared civil emergencies because people are fleeing what Alexander Cortez would have for America.
[03:34:32.459 --> 03:34:33.039]  Communism.
[03:34:33.900 --> 03:34:34.080]  Show!
[03:34:35.529 --> 03:34:41.055]  Here is Trump's Venezuela military option gains backers as millions flee.
[03:34:42.136 --> 03:34:48.422]  When President Donald Trump said a year ago, just like they're fleeing California, when President Donald Trump said a year ago the U.S.
[03:34:48.462 --> 03:34:50.044]  was considering a military option,
[03:34:51.598 --> 03:34:55.200]  For Venezuela, hardly anyone in Washington thought it was a good idea.
[03:34:55.220 --> 03:34:58.602]  Again, I don't want military options, but it is a national security issue.
[03:34:58.622 --> 03:35:04.044]  Because Mexico and others have opened up a conduit, a corridor, for anybody that wants to come up from South America.
[03:35:04.565 --> 03:35:17.932]  Today, as Venezuela slides towards dictatorship, they've been a dictatorship for 15 years, and collapse, already collapsed, triggering a million strong migration crisis, which Soros is already in
[03:35:19.218 --> 03:35:20.399]  Countries north of that setting up.
[03:35:20.759 --> 03:35:22.800]  Support for such a move is being discussed openly.
[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:32.785]  The notion of using force to topple the government of President Nicolas Maduro is gaining adherence, although it remains a distinctly minority view.
[03:35:33.345 --> 03:35:36.126]  Now, I just say seal that border with the U.S.
[03:35:36.166 --> 03:35:36.606]  military.
[03:35:36.646 --> 03:35:37.647]  The wall's not even needed.
[03:35:37.687 --> 03:35:39.528]  Put 100,000 troops on the border.
[03:35:39.548 --> 03:35:40.168]  That should do it.
[03:35:41.149 --> 03:35:45.571]  And just let the heaven of Latin America descend into hell.
[03:35:46.371 --> 03:35:53.615]  Because everyone wants to get up here and then say George Washington and America sucks and piss on everything and run around bitching.
[03:35:54.135 --> 03:36:01.659]  I think Californians and all the socialists should just run down there to Venezuela and just bash in your heaven.
[03:36:01.959 --> 03:36:07.963]  Or go to China where there's no welfare, criticize the police, they cut your genitals off and murder you, go work in an apple slave plant.
[03:36:08.263 --> 03:36:09.583]  It's okay because Tim Cook's gay.
[03:36:11.765 --> 03:36:12.565]  I murder everyone.
[03:36:12.765 --> 03:36:13.265]  I'm liberal.
[03:36:14.346 --> 03:36:16.106]  You know, I help censor everyone.
[03:36:16.506 --> 03:36:17.887]  That's what they're doing here.
[03:36:17.907 --> 03:36:20.087]  A little uncouth when I do that, but it's okay.
[03:36:20.927 --> 03:36:23.188]  Jack Pasovic, I was doing that on the street in D.C.
[03:36:23.228 --> 03:36:27.529]  in front of news cameras, and he was just going like, yeah, at a certain point, I don't care.
[03:36:27.549 --> 03:36:28.529]  Okay, I'm having some fun here.
[03:36:29.129 --> 03:36:32.590]  But it's just like Tim Cook's like, I can kill whoever I want.
[03:36:32.650 --> 03:36:33.930]  It's like, I'm gay.
[03:36:33.990 --> 03:36:34.530]  It's liberal.
[03:36:35.190 --> 03:36:36.391]  I can censor whoever I want.
[03:36:36.451 --> 03:36:36.851]  It's gay.
[03:36:36.911 --> 03:36:37.391]  It's liberal.
[03:36:38.757 --> 03:36:39.978]  Well, you're gay, so it's okay.
[03:36:40.218 --> 03:36:42.380]  If Hitler would have said he was gay, Tim Cook would be like, I'm Hitler!
[03:36:42.440 --> 03:36:43.981]  I'd be like, oh my God, Hitler's so cool!
[03:36:45.082 --> 03:36:47.384]  Anyways, sorry, I'm getting a little bit too much into it.
[03:36:49.986 --> 03:36:51.347]  There he is.
[03:36:51.367 --> 03:36:54.409]  Going back to Roger Stone, I mean, what do you make of the situation in Venezuela, Roger?
[03:36:55.970 --> 03:36:58.592]  You know, wait a minute, this is a socialist utopia.
[03:36:59.773 --> 03:37:05.778]  We were told that this was heaven on earth, that their system was so far superior to ours.
[03:37:06.440 --> 03:37:11.227]  People, there are no dogs left because people have hunted them all down to kill them for food.
[03:37:11.667 --> 03:37:15.673]  People are eating grass because they can't find anything to eat.
[03:37:15.773 --> 03:37:22.422]  No, it's an international emergency and Donald Trump, in my opinion, has the courage to take a stand.
[03:37:23.042 --> 03:37:26.965]  And by the way, Venezuela used to be as rich as Argentina like a hundred years ago.
[03:37:27.305 --> 03:37:28.686]  Richer than the U.S.
[03:37:28.706 --> 03:37:29.707]  50 years ago, as rich.
[03:37:30.047 --> 03:37:34.190]  They're diamonds, rubies, gold, timber, oil.
[03:37:34.370 --> 03:37:36.711]  It's a frickin' paradise of resources.
[03:37:38.052 --> 03:37:44.897]  Yeah, there is no reason for the current situation, given their riches, particularly in the terms of petroleum.
[03:37:45.527 --> 03:37:48.549]  But this is what communism gets you.
[03:37:49.050 --> 03:38:01.818]  Alex, speaking of food, I do have to mention to you that on Monday night, I was invited out to dinner by a New York Times reporter, and he said that it was on him, which meant it was on Carlos Slim.
[03:38:02.399 --> 03:38:13.746]  And therefore, I took him to the finest steakhouse in all of South Florida, where I knew they had an incredible 48-ounce porterhouse that is just a thing to behold.
[03:38:13.766 --> 03:38:14.467]  Okay, I'm getting hungry.
[03:38:15.390 --> 03:38:16.831]  And therefore, I ordered it.
[03:38:16.971 --> 03:38:19.193]  And I must tell you, I enjoyed every bite.
[03:38:19.273 --> 03:38:22.816]  But afterwards, it was really debilitating.
[03:38:22.976 --> 03:38:29.361]  And then I remembered, I had ordered a bottle of Carnivore from the InfoWars.com store.
[03:38:30.022 --> 03:38:35.286]  Let me tell you, this is now my new favorite product next to Brain Force Plus.
[03:38:36.364 --> 03:38:41.611]  You don't have the situation where this just sits in your gut and ferments.
[03:38:41.771 --> 03:38:46.196]  The enzymes that are used in carnivore help you to gently digest.
[03:38:46.216 --> 03:38:49.960]  You don't end up like John Wayne with 45 pounds of undigested Hillary Clinton in your guts.
[03:38:50.791 --> 03:38:52.072]  I mean, it's exactly right.
[03:38:52.532 --> 03:38:58.654]  In this case, my digestive dis-ease disappeared like that.
[03:38:59.174 --> 03:39:01.275]  This is a truly great product.
[03:39:01.395 --> 03:39:07.237]  And right now, $23.42 on a special price, worth every penny of it.
[03:39:07.297 --> 03:39:17.141]  So the next time you're going to gouge Carlos Slim and hand him a restaurant bill of a couple hundred bucks for some of the finest beef in the United States,
[03:39:17.741 --> 03:39:20.243]  Make sure you've got your bottle of carnivore first.
[03:39:20.403 --> 03:39:21.223]  Well, you say beef.
[03:39:21.283 --> 03:39:22.264]  I'm getting really hungry here.
[03:39:22.304 --> 03:39:23.364]  What's the name of the steakhouse?
[03:39:24.145 --> 03:39:27.007]  It was called Mastro's Ocean House.
[03:39:27.227 --> 03:39:28.627]  This is a new place.
[03:39:28.708 --> 03:39:30.489]  It's just opened in South Florida.
[03:39:30.949 --> 03:39:32.610]  I know there's one in New York City.
[03:39:32.670 --> 03:39:34.451]  I know there's one in Washington, D.C.
[03:39:35.031 --> 03:39:40.474]  I must tell you, it was outstanding, but the best thing about it, it was being paid for by the New York Times.
[03:39:40.494 --> 03:39:44.597]  Well, there's nothing better than a glass of red wine, a big old juicy porterhouse and potatoes gratin.
[03:39:45.157 --> 03:39:45.937]  And some asparagus.
[03:39:45.957 --> 03:39:47.998]  But like I said, I gotta get a driver when I do that.
[03:39:48.078 --> 03:39:49.219]  Actual Uber or whatever.
[03:39:49.559 --> 03:39:52.581]  Because when I get home, it's like BOOM!
[03:39:52.761 --> 03:39:55.002]  We're talking sleep for 12 hours when I hit a porterhouse.
[03:39:56.001 --> 03:40:00.864]  Yeah, it's called the food coma, but you can avoid the negative effects with carnivore.
[03:40:01.845 --> 03:40:07.088]  So this is, you can now add another satisfied... But you know what Bernie Sanders said?
[03:40:07.108 --> 03:40:15.354]  He said, when I go to the store, hundreds of different vitamins, 30 different deodorants, I don't need it.
[03:40:16.054 --> 03:40:18.536]  Too much freedom, too much diversity.
[03:40:19.176 --> 03:40:25.219]  Now, I never found a university, I didn't swindle, and I have three $1 million homes.
[03:40:25.919 --> 03:40:29.381]  And they called for me to be banned on Twitter, Alex Jones, because he criticized me.
[03:40:29.721 --> 03:40:35.284]  But when we get in people's faces, when the Antifa does and says they're going to kill you, then it's okay.
[03:40:36.084 --> 03:40:37.825]  So, let me ask you now.
[03:40:38.446 --> 03:40:43.068]  What do you think is going to happen with President Trump in the next 40 days, Roger?
[03:40:44.423 --> 03:41:00.949]  Well, Alex, this meeting that he has with Rod Rosenstein, the rogue Deputy Attorney General who most definitely has been exposed for proposing to wear a wire in order to entrap the President of the United States to remove him under the
[03:41:01.389 --> 03:41:02.730]  25th Amendment.
[03:41:03.030 --> 03:41:03.951]  Remember that, folks.
[03:41:03.971 --> 03:41:06.352]  You heard it here at InfoWars First.
[03:41:06.933 --> 03:41:07.873]  It was not a joke.
[03:41:07.913 --> 03:41:09.514]  He was not joking.
[03:41:09.854 --> 03:41:14.677]  The New York Times story makes it clear that several of their sources asked, is this a joke?
[03:41:14.877 --> 03:41:17.239]  Andrew McCabe asked him, are you joking?
[03:41:17.259 --> 03:41:19.100]  Sure, so what happens to Marta Ratstein?
[03:41:20.281 --> 03:41:21.502]  Well, that's an excellent question.
[03:41:21.542 --> 03:41:22.802]  There are three possibilities.
[03:41:23.423 --> 03:41:24.904]  One, he resigns.
[03:41:25.444 --> 03:41:26.845]  Two, he is fired.
[03:41:27.455 --> 03:41:31.097]  I mean, Rosenstein literally looks like one of those ventriloquist dolls.
[03:41:31.117 --> 03:41:31.857]  You've got the backstory on him.
[03:41:31.877 --> 03:41:33.818]  Like, I heard he, like, covered up for the mafia.
[03:41:33.878 --> 03:41:35.158]  He's really corrupt.
[03:41:52.079 --> 03:41:59.544]  Yeah, look, his appointment is due to Reince Priebus, the president's first White House chief of staff.
[03:42:00.184 --> 03:42:08.849]  Why you would appoint James Comey and Robert Mueller's best friend as your deputy attorney general is beyond me.
[03:42:08.949 --> 03:42:11.811]  This guy is a charter member of the swamp.
[03:42:12.378 --> 03:42:15.401]  He is a swamp creature through and through.
[03:42:15.421 --> 03:42:19.025]  He has stonewalled the Congress in their efforts to get at him.
[03:42:19.045 --> 03:42:19.686]  Let me just be honest.
[03:42:19.706 --> 03:42:20.687]  I'm going to come out with it here.
[03:42:21.108 --> 03:42:26.013]  He gang raped me along with Comey and Mueller a few years ago, 37 years ago.
[03:42:26.814 --> 03:42:28.296]  And they got me drunk on punch.
[03:42:28.316 --> 03:42:29.457]  You need to believe any accused.
[03:42:29.497 --> 03:42:31.920]  So he has to step down now.
[03:42:32.180 --> 03:42:33.341]  Rosenstein raped me.
[03:42:34.246 --> 03:42:36.568]  He raped me over and over again, and you have to believe me.
[03:42:36.588 --> 03:42:39.610]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic, folks, but we'll be right back.
[03:42:40.511 --> 03:42:40.731]  Oops.
[03:42:40.951 --> 03:42:44.434]  Yeah, it's true that Rosenstein... I'm only dreaming, actually.
[03:42:44.454 --> 03:42:46.035]  I have a thing for Twirlikless dolls.
[03:42:46.856 --> 03:42:48.797]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:42:48.877 --> 03:42:53.641]  Stay with us.
[03:42:53.661 --> 03:42:54.121]  Now!
[03:42:56.123 --> 03:42:57.424]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:42:59.082 --> 03:43:01.164]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:43:01.444 --> 03:43:02.484]  I believe in you!
[03:43:02.504 --> 03:43:04.066]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:43:05.847 --> 03:43:08.729]  One man ever raped a woman!
[03:43:09.069 --> 03:43:10.670]  All genitals were cut off!
[03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:13.332]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:43:13.472 --> 03:43:14.673]  And we're not backing down ever!
[03:43:14.693 --> 03:43:17.755]  I wanna kick these people!
[03:43:17.795 --> 03:43:18.315]  We're winning!
[03:43:18.355 --> 03:43:19.476]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:43:19.616 --> 03:43:20.076]  Can't you?
[03:43:20.377 --> 03:43:21.998]  We have broken their back!
[03:43:22.378 --> 03:43:23.539]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:43:27.381 --> 03:43:27.922]  Let's go!
[03:43:29.318 --> 03:43:29.718]  Come on!
[03:43:29.738 --> 03:43:30.078]  Come on!

[03:43:49.668 --> 03:43:49.868]  Come on
[03:43:58.157 --> 03:44:03.302]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[03:44:03.662 --> 03:44:05.744]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[03:44:07.719 --> 03:44:16.727]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:44:17.067 --> 03:44:23.293]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[03:44:23.813 --> 03:44:28.618]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[03:44:29.038 --> 03:44:29.979]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:44:30.519 --> 03:44:32.461]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[03:44:32.821 --> 03:44:35.624]  Apple banned your app.
[03:44:36.004 --> 03:44:39.126]  I helped, too!
[03:44:39.567 --> 03:44:40.007]  Oliver!
[03:44:40.027 --> 03:44:43.991]  I hate free speech, too!
[03:44:44.071 --> 03:44:46.233]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:46.253 --> 03:44:48.014]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:48.174 --> 03:44:49.816]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:49.896 --> 03:44:51.797]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:54.722 --> 03:44:59.044]  All these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[03:44:59.125 --> 03:44:59.865]  So I'm here.
[03:44:59.885 --> 03:45:00.465]  Hammering.
[03:45:00.905 --> 03:45:01.186]  Hammering.
[03:45:01.566 --> 03:45:01.906]  Hammering.
[03:45:02.226 --> 03:45:02.506]  Hammering.
[03:45:02.606 --> 03:45:03.907]  Stop the hammering.
[03:45:04.367 --> 03:45:05.848]  Stop the hammering out there.
[03:45:05.888 --> 03:45:06.729]  Who's got a hammer?
[03:45:07.009 --> 03:45:07.509]  Where is it?
[03:45:07.849 --> 03:45:08.129]  Hammering.
[03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.890]  Hammering.
[03:45:09.170 --> 03:45:09.550]  Hammering.
[03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:10.211]  Hammering.
[03:45:10.631 --> 03:45:11.531]  Where's the hammer?
[03:45:12.332 --> 03:45:14.173]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor.
[03:45:14.273 --> 03:45:16.414]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering.
[03:45:16.614 --> 03:45:16.874]  Hammering.
[03:45:17.254 --> 03:45:17.615]  Hammering.
[03:45:17.935 --> 03:45:18.275]  Hammering.
[03:45:18.595 --> 03:45:18.955]  Hammering.
[03:45:19.256 --> 03:45:19.636]  Hammering.
[03:45:20.016 --> 03:45:21.617]  Stop the hammering.
[03:45:24.761 --> 03:45:26.081]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[03:45:26.101 --> 03:45:27.702]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[03:45:27.842 --> 03:45:29.342]  Stop the hammering!
[03:45:29.622 --> 03:45:30.602]  Hammering, hammering.
[03:45:31.442 --> 03:45:35.703]  And all these fools, and all these traitors don't get it.
[03:45:36.263 --> 03:45:42.664]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[03:45:43.245 --> 03:45:45.285]  It just f***ing sucks.
[03:45:45.625 --> 03:45:49.866]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[03:45:50.586 --> 03:45:56.491]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control of everything.
[03:45:56.531 --> 03:45:56.911]  They're here.
[03:45:57.392 --> 03:46:00.294]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[03:46:00.354 --> 03:46:01.095]  That's what I know.
[03:46:01.755 --> 03:46:04.838]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[03:46:05.238 --> 03:46:10.842]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it is Choose Your Own Adventure at Infowarshore.com.
[03:46:11.123 --> 03:46:12.083]  Standing with America.
[03:46:12.304 --> 03:46:14.065]  Standing against the Chai-coms in Hollywood.
[03:46:14.285 --> 03:46:15.706]  Standing for victory and winning.
[03:46:15.887 --> 03:46:16.447]  Thanks to you.
[03:46:16.527 --> 03:46:17.007]  We'll be back.
[03:46:17.848 --> 03:46:20.930]  I'll go down to the g***** floor myself and stop it.
[03:46:20.970 --> 03:46:22.772]  Keep the g***** commercial break going.
[03:46:23.372 --> 03:46:27.055]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:46:27.195 --> 03:46:32.279]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:35.361]  It is absolutely free.
[03:46:35.601 --> 03:46:40.465]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[03:46:40.785 --> 03:46:44.427]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:46:44.547 --> 03:46:48.650]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point blank range.

[03:46:57.195 --> 03:46:59.877]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.958 --> 03:47:14.398]  Hi, Roger Jones here, hosting with me.
[03:47:14.418 --> 03:47:15.219]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:15.259 --> 03:47:17.699]  Part of this broadcast goes all the way to midnight tonight.
[03:47:17.719 --> 03:47:18.219]  Stand with Trump.
[03:47:18.259 --> 03:47:18.999]  Stand with Infowars.
[03:47:19.339 --> 03:47:21.760]  Stand with America and the recovery.
[03:47:23.340 --> 03:47:24.401]  Oh, you're anti-government?
[03:47:24.441 --> 03:47:25.381]  Yeah, I was anti-globalist.
[03:47:25.441 --> 03:47:27.701]  Once we get our government back, I'm pro-Constitution.
[03:47:27.761 --> 03:47:29.842]  I mean, my God, we're all being persecuted for this.
[03:47:30.342 --> 03:47:36.743]  So, Pigelstein, Ratstein, whatever you want to call him, they crapped their britches a week ago when Trump said he'd release it.
[03:47:36.783 --> 03:47:39.224]  Then they said, oh, have the Inspector General
[03:47:41.207 --> 03:47:41.568]  I don't
[03:47:53.755 --> 03:47:54.215]  Elected.
[03:47:54.795 --> 03:47:56.156]  You said, look out.
[03:47:56.796 --> 03:47:58.036]  They've used illegal spying.
[03:47:58.116 --> 03:47:59.076]  They've done all this.
[03:47:59.637 --> 03:48:00.437]  You've been proven right.
[03:48:00.577 --> 03:48:02.237]  Release the secret documents.
[03:48:02.377 --> 03:48:05.718]  All it is, is their criminal operation reporting back to Hillary.
[03:48:06.098 --> 03:48:07.199]  We already know what's in it.
[03:48:07.219 --> 03:48:08.519]  It's already in the WikiLeaks.
[03:48:08.579 --> 03:48:12.880]  I mean, this is... Why isn't the Death Star firing weapons now?
[03:48:13.580 --> 03:48:15.861]  He needs to destroy them now.
[03:48:17.719 --> 03:48:32.610]  Because some of his timid advisors are taking the ridiculous position that declassifying these documents will somehow expose their sources and methods and threaten the national security.
[03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:35.192]  It was Hillary's secret server did that to the whole world.
[03:48:35.773 --> 03:48:37.674]  They're the globalists selling out America.
[03:48:37.694 --> 03:48:39.215]  The personnel management hack.
[03:48:39.515 --> 03:48:40.056]  Exactly!
[03:48:41.179 --> 03:48:55.838]  What declassification these documents will prove is that the Obama Justice Department and the Obama FBI used unconstitutional surveillance of the Trump campaign to first try to prevent his election and now try to negate his election.
[03:48:55.858 --> 03:48:59.163]  And by the way, hasn't Obama looked like he's crapping bricks lately?
[03:49:00.518 --> 03:49:03.360]  Well, because this is where it all leads to.
[03:49:03.420 --> 03:49:05.682]  What did the President know and when did he know it?
[03:49:06.023 --> 03:49:09.565]  When will President Trump order Barack Obama's arrest?
[03:49:09.806 --> 03:49:11.107]  That's the only question.
[03:49:12.568 --> 03:49:14.590]  Your victory is pulling the lever.
[03:49:14.970 --> 03:49:17.632]  They only take his restraint and his détente, his weakness.
[03:49:18.052 --> 03:49:20.214]  He needs to pull the lever now.
[03:49:20.574 --> 03:49:23.437]  He needs to say, fire at will, Commander.
[03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:25.390]  No question about it.
[03:49:25.470 --> 03:49:28.892]  That's precisely what I have written and said today.
[03:49:28.912 --> 03:49:31.294]  And it's what he needs to do.
[03:49:31.374 --> 03:49:33.556]  Do not be deterred by these quizlings.
[03:49:33.716 --> 03:49:39.000]  And notice, that's why they hate you and I and others, because we say, attack, attack, attack, because we're in the right.
[03:49:39.140 --> 03:49:40.561]  We have victory within sight.
[03:49:41.062 --> 03:49:42.943]  We have them dead in the crosshairs politically.
[03:49:43.303 --> 03:49:44.144]  Fire!
[03:49:44.544 --> 03:49:45.365]  Fire!
[03:49:45.465 --> 03:49:46.165]  Yes!
[03:49:46.546 --> 03:49:47.827]  Plus, it's what people want!
[03:49:49.208 --> 03:49:50.769]  And therefore, their response is,
[03:49:51.624 --> 03:49:52.745]  Ban InfoWars!
[03:49:53.265 --> 03:49:54.546]  Get them off of Facebook!
[03:49:54.566 --> 03:49:55.666]  Get them off of Twitter!
[03:49:56.166 --> 03:49:58.327]  Get them off of every platform you can!
[03:49:58.347 --> 03:50:00.929]  But if it's such a bad strategy, why do they want to shut up?
[03:50:00.969 --> 03:50:02.710]  Because it's the winning strategy!
[03:50:03.810 --> 03:50:04.771]  That's exactly right.
[03:50:04.831 --> 03:50:15.416]  No, they're afraid the President will see you, or me, or David Knight, or Owen Schroer, or any other number of people here at InfoWars telling the truth and laying out what must happen.
[03:50:15.756 --> 03:50:18.137]  And that's the last thing in the world they want.
[03:50:18.177 --> 03:50:19.018]  See, that's why the
[03:50:20.015 --> 03:50:27.382]  It was significant that the Rosenstein story was not published by, say, Breitbart News, or the Daily Caller, or even InfoWars.
[03:50:27.802 --> 03:50:33.047]  It's in the New York Times, and it's triple-sourced, and there's no way to keep it away from him.
[03:50:33.367 --> 03:50:39.392]  There's no way for him not to know that Rosenstein is a weasel... Well, that's my question.
[03:50:39.432 --> 03:50:40.673]  Why would the New York Times...
[03:50:41.684 --> 03:50:42.025]  Exactly.
[03:50:42.065 --> 03:50:45.170]  Why would the New York Times expose one of their globalist operatives, Rosenstein?
[03:50:45.190 --> 03:50:46.031]  He's not the only one.
[03:50:46.853 --> 03:50:47.774]  Why did they burn him?
[03:50:47.835 --> 03:50:51.601]  Because they knew the president already knew and secret documents were coming out.
[03:50:51.861 --> 03:50:53.324]  So they wanted to have a controlled release.
[03:50:54.835 --> 03:51:00.500]  Yeah, and I think maybe an early warning to try to dissuade the President from canning it.
[03:51:00.580 --> 03:51:09.247]  Right now, what's going on, even as we speak, is a three-day effort to convince the President not to fire this weasel when they meet tomorrow.
[03:51:09.627 --> 03:51:15.772]  Because if the President had taken action right after he read this story, he would have canned this guy in record time.
[03:51:15.832 --> 03:51:16.152]  I agree.
[03:51:16.192 --> 03:51:17.193]  Who does he put in?
[03:51:17.273 --> 03:51:19.115]  Why does he put Judge Napolitano in?
[03:51:20.188 --> 03:51:22.650]  Well, he needs somebody that's confirmable.
[03:51:22.770 --> 03:51:26.834]  The rumor is a Southern member of the U.S.
[03:51:26.894 --> 03:51:30.177]  Senate who's a known Trump hardliner.
[03:51:30.918 --> 03:51:41.247]  I'm going to guess that that's Senator Richard Shelby from Alabama, the senator from Alabama who isn't comatose or wasn't comatose, unlike Jeff Sessions.
[03:51:41.707 --> 03:51:44.910]  Although I would admit that that is a guess on my part.
[03:51:45.330 --> 03:51:46.952]  It's time to have an attorney general.
[03:51:47.552 --> 03:51:50.014]  Who believes in the rule of law?
[03:51:50.715 --> 03:52:09.391]  In the meantime, if the office were to remain vacant, the two names, and there's some contentious about this, a lawyer named Panuccio, who's the Associate Attorney General from Florida, or Noel Francisco, who is the Solicitor General, confirmed by the U.S.
[03:52:09.471 --> 03:52:13.815]  Senate, either one of them would now be in charge of the Mueller investigation.
[03:52:13.895 --> 03:52:14.816]  And let's expand on this.
[03:52:16.977 --> 03:52:19.258]  You can smell death in the Democratic Party politically.
[03:52:19.298 --> 03:52:20.599]  They're a rotting corpse.
[03:52:21.139 --> 03:52:26.322]  All we have to do is make the right move right now, and we will secure this country's future for a long time.
[03:52:26.342 --> 03:52:36.928]  Let's spend a few minutes with the President, though, astutely breaking down the con artistry of Kavanaugh, the whole Kavanaugh attack, and the con artistry of this system to destroy Kavanaugh.
[03:52:36.948 --> 03:52:37.228]  Here it is.
[03:52:38.046 --> 03:52:39.007]  Give us some thoughts, sir.
[03:52:39.427 --> 03:52:41.429]  I think he's just a wonderful human being.
[03:52:41.490 --> 03:52:44.373]  I mean, I think it's horrible what the Democrats have done.
[03:52:44.653 --> 03:52:46.274]  It's a con game they're playing.
[03:52:46.315 --> 03:52:47.556]  They're really con artists.
[03:52:47.956 --> 03:52:52.821]  They're trying to convince... You know, they don't believe it themselves, okay?
[03:52:53.382 --> 03:52:55.003]  They know he's a high-quality person.
[03:52:55.424 --> 03:52:56.805]  They don't believe him.
[03:52:56.845 --> 03:52:59.148]  It's just resist and obstruct.
[03:53:00.134 --> 03:53:01.394]  They're playing a con game.
[03:53:02.214 --> 03:53:03.315]  And they play it very well.
[03:53:03.355 --> 03:53:05.575]  They play it actually much better than the Republicans.
[03:53:05.975 --> 03:53:08.436]  They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy.
[03:53:08.456 --> 03:53:09.616]  They don't know what the hell they're doing.
[03:53:09.656 --> 03:53:10.596]  They want to get rid of ICE.
[03:53:11.397 --> 03:53:14.237]  They want to get rid of law enforcement.
[03:53:14.257 --> 03:53:15.898]  They don't want to take care of our military.
[03:53:16.418 --> 03:53:17.738]  They want to raise your taxes.
[03:53:18.818 --> 03:53:19.918]  But they're good at one thing.
[03:53:20.539 --> 03:53:21.339]  They're good at one thing.
[03:53:21.439 --> 03:53:23.619]  That's obstruction and resisting and con.
[03:53:25.020 --> 03:53:26.560]  He's one of the highest quality
[03:53:27.455 --> 03:53:34.805]  People, you know when he said that really what he was focused on was trying to be number one in his class at Yale, to me that was so believable.
[03:53:34.845 --> 03:53:41.714]  I understand college very well and I understand being number one in your class and I understand a lot of things.
[03:53:41.934 --> 03:53:44.938]  When he said that, I understood exactly what he was so...
[03:53:46.119 --> 03:53:46.599]  Truthful.
[03:53:46.699 --> 03:53:47.719]  And I think it came out.
[03:53:47.739 --> 03:53:48.740]  I mean, I hope it came out.
[03:53:48.820 --> 03:53:56.362]  But for the Democrats to be trying to make him into something... No, but let's be nice about it, that he's not.
[03:53:57.162 --> 03:53:59.022]  He's a high-quality person.
[03:53:59.042 --> 03:54:00.103]  He's a great intellect.
[03:54:01.183 --> 03:54:03.383]  You're also not seeing him on his footing.
[03:54:03.503 --> 03:54:04.464]  This isn't his footing.
[03:54:04.504 --> 03:54:05.664]  He's never been here before.
[03:54:06.524 --> 03:54:08.405]  He's never had any charges like this.
[03:54:08.425 --> 03:54:14.046]  I mean, charges come up from 36 years ago that are totally unsubstantiated.
[03:54:15.376 --> 03:54:23.263]  I mean, you, as watching this, as the president of a great country, Columbia, you must say, how is this possible?
[03:54:24.544 --> 03:54:30.009]  36 years ago, nobody ever knew about it, nobody ever heard about it, and now a new charge comes up.
[03:54:30.891 --> 03:54:41.694]  And she said, well, it might not be him, and there were gaps, and she said she was totally inebriated, and she was all messed up, and she doesn't know it was him, but it might have been him.
[03:54:42.235 --> 03:54:45.916]  Oh, gee, let's not make him a Supreme Court judge because of that.
[03:54:46.716 --> 03:54:49.397]  This is a con game being played by the Democrats.
[03:54:49.497 --> 03:54:51.678]  Also, take a look at the lawyers.
[03:54:52.138 --> 03:54:55.739]  These lawyers are the same lawyers that have been fighting for years.
[03:54:56.619 --> 03:54:57.340]  They keep fighting.
[03:54:57.920 --> 03:54:58.841]  Take a look at the lawyers.
[03:54:59.421 --> 03:55:02.123]  And it's a shame that you can do this to a person's life.
[03:55:02.163 --> 03:55:10.708]  And I'll tell you, maybe even more important, who's going to want to go before this system to be a Supreme Court judge or to be a judge?
[03:55:10.728 --> 03:55:11.329]  Stop right there.
[03:55:11.589 --> 03:55:12.129]  He goes on.
[03:55:12.169 --> 03:55:14.651]  The terrorizing of everyone that's backed Trump.
[03:55:16.562 --> 03:55:17.983]  I almost disagree with the president here.
[03:55:18.584 --> 03:55:20.025]  Does it make you not want to?
[03:55:20.045 --> 03:55:23.028]  It's like Clarence Thomas said, this is all BS, but I'm here to clear my name.
[03:55:23.048 --> 03:55:24.109]  You're not making me back down.
[03:55:24.470 --> 03:55:26.692]  I don't want this judgeship, but you're not going to destroy me.
[03:55:27.292 --> 03:55:29.955]  And so they put us in this existential crisis.
[03:55:30.415 --> 03:55:32.578]  It actually, I think, makes us man up, Roger.
[03:55:33.539 --> 03:55:36.722]  And so I think there's going to be a big price to pay in 40 days.
[03:55:37.242 --> 03:55:38.163]  I think red wave.
[03:55:38.183 --> 03:55:39.704]  There's a seawall of election fraud.
[03:55:40.782 --> 03:55:45.727]  But I, gut level, man, I think we're going to see the House and Senate held.
[03:55:46.248 --> 03:55:48.130]  And then what happens if that's true, Roger?
[03:55:48.150 --> 03:55:49.812]  A. Do you think Kavanaugh gets confirmed gut level?
[03:55:50.172 --> 03:55:52.675]  B. Red Wave, Blue Wave, or a stalemate?
[03:55:53.135 --> 03:55:55.178]  And then what does the left do when they lose?
[03:55:56.479 --> 03:56:02.683]  This has stirred Trump-supporting voters and those who voted for Trump in 2016 like nothing else.
[03:56:03.123 --> 03:56:17.692]  The story on page one in yesterday's New York Times by Jonathan Martin about why the Kavanaugh controversy is going to lead to a blue wave and why voters are going to be revolted by the Republicans' treatment of women is total bourgeois nonsense.
[03:56:18.052 --> 03:56:21.194]  His uninformed opinion based on nothing.
[03:56:21.734 --> 03:56:36.744]  On the contrary, as I move around, I find conservatives and moderates and pro-Trump voters angry and motivated to turn out because they're revolted about the character assassination against Judge Kavanaugh.
[03:56:37.044 --> 03:56:42.268]  And doesn't the censorship on social media make conservatives be sure to not just vote but get others to vote?
[03:56:43.628 --> 03:56:45.430]  I think it is a vital part of it.
[03:56:45.470 --> 03:56:47.411]  Look, you've got the senator from Hawaii admitting
[03:56:48.027 --> 03:56:51.308]  Doesn't matter whether any of the stuff of Kavanaugh is true, she says.
[03:56:51.709 --> 03:56:55.490]  He must withdraw because the charges have been made.
[03:56:55.911 --> 03:56:57.851]  No, Senator, you should withdraw.
[03:56:58.111 --> 03:56:59.552]  You should resign from the Senate.
[03:56:59.872 --> 03:57:03.614]  You've soiled yourself with inane comments like that.
[03:57:04.074 --> 03:57:09.738]  We have a system under which you are innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.
[03:57:10.138 --> 03:57:15.681]  The people who have accused Kavanaugh have no corroboration, no eyewitnesses, no proof.
[03:57:23.326 --> 03:57:28.631]  Owen Benjamin is joining us, Will Johnson, Roger Stone, Owen Schwerer, but a bunch of others.

[03:57:31.134 --> 03:57:33.236]  Whatever you do, remember, we're censored if not for you.
[03:57:33.576 --> 03:57:36.479]  Spread those links at truck stops and church and via email.
[03:57:36.599 --> 03:57:38.881]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:57:38.901 --> 03:57:40.683]  The most banned broadcast in the world.
[03:57:40.903 --> 03:57:41.864]  War Room straight ahead.
[03:57:43.769 --> 03:57:50.016]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[03:57:50.056 --> 03:58:01.868]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[03:58:02.028 --> 03:58:07.913]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[03:58:08.013 --> 03:58:21.063]  Last month, the website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[03:58:21.303 --> 03:58:28.168]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, stealing a blow to one of founder Alex Jones.
[03:58:28.268 --> 03:58:31.210]  It actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced.
[03:58:49.305 --> 03:58:52.007]  To social media censorship.
[03:58:52.047 --> 03:58:52.868]  That's the new thing.
[03:58:53.308 --> 03:58:57.451]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[03:58:57.772 --> 03:58:59.713]  PayPal on Thursday night informed in
