[00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.879]  Big Brother.
[00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:13.759]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.880]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.200]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.881]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:24.682]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:44.202]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're only 41 days out from this incredibly important historical election.
[00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:47.465]  We have a jam-packed global broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:50.168]  I want to thank you all for joining us.
[00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:54.193]  Remember, this is the most demonized, most lied about, most attacked
[00:00:54.713 --> 00:01:07.704]  Broadcast in the world by multinational globalist corporations, by the communist Chinese, by the Hollywood pedophile scum, and by Democrat control freaks and criminal networks across the United States.
[00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:09.225]  And for good reason.
[00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:10.586]  They hate your guts.
[00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:12.127]  They hate America.
[00:01:12.127 --> 00:01:13.368]  They hate flyover country.
[00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:14.630]  They hate hard-working people.
[00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:18.667]  And they want to use divide and conquer to control us.
[00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:27.011]  And they see Infowars as a manifestation of the spirit of human resistance against their evil.
[00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:36.975]  And they want to extinguish the American spirit and the Renaissance spirit and the true spirit of Christ in this country.
[00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:40.376]  And they know that our spirit and our will is strong.
[00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:44.478]  They know that Infowars is a serious focal point.
[00:01:46.457 --> 00:02:00.967]  Of that resistance, and so they are amassing everything they can to try to destroy Infowars and destroy President Trump to destroy any type of organization or kinship that we have together to understand we have solidarity.
[00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:14.517]  That comes out in their internal emails, it comes out in their WikiLeaks, it came out in a new video yesterday of one of the main operatives for Twitter that always has his tweets put right up there with Trump's artificially, how we're there to sow the division.
[00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:18.446]  We're there to sow the discord.
[00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:19.747]  That is their plan.
[00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:21.609]  Sabotage.
[00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.890]  And guess what?
[00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.454]  Interest rates have been raised six times since Trump got in 20 months ago.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.481]  They were never raved when Obama was in for eight years.
[00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:45.487]  And the Federal Reserve has come out, there's an article in Reuters, saying fed to lift rates possibly to end accommodative policy era to a good economy.
[00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:49.429]  That translates to stop the recovery and stop Trump.
[00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.491]  So that's the scientific way of saying it.
[00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:58.374]  What good old Bill Maher said about how he wants people to basically be homeless in a depression.
[00:03:00.342 --> 00:03:02.445]  Show that people learn to hate Trump.
[00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:04.908]  So, sabotage it is.
[00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:07.551]  And that's exactly who these lawless individuals are.
[00:03:07.551 --> 00:03:09.574]  So now it's up to us to expose this.
[00:03:09.574 --> 00:03:13.418]  The President must take over the private Federal Reserve.
[00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:16.803]  Only the President can do it through executive action the way the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was set up.
[00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:19.052]  I don't know.
[00:03:34.127 --> 00:03:37.910]  It's unbelievable to see the whole power structure against this country.
[00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.074]  And six interest rate hikes, and they still cannot suppress the recovery.
[00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:50.759]  They know it's going past 4.8% growth, and they just don't know what to do.
[00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.541]  They're so desperate to keep you demoralized.
[00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.002]  They're so desperate to sabotage you.
[00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:55.963]  It's just simply amazing.
[00:03:55.963 --> 00:03:59.706]  So when we come back from break, of course, right on time.
[00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.108]  I predicted this last Tuesday, eight days ago.
[00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:12.660]  That there would be three more accusers, at least, and they would go them out starting on the weekend before the vote, right up to the day of the vote, and now right on time.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:24.804]  Another woman says that in high school she witnessed Kavanaugh and Mr. Judge, his friend, pulling Amtraks on girls, pulling the train.
[00:04:24.804 --> 00:04:32.407]  So I guess they've been listening to too much Too Short, or too much Too Live Crew.
[00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:36.454]  But, uh, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:46.619]  Of course, everybody that knows Kavanaugh said he was a total nerd, and would just study 20 hours a day, and didn't even have girlfriends, but his buddy Judge did, so now they're gonna tie him into all this.
[00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:50.721]  They said there was punch there to get the girls drunk and rape them.
[00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:52.322]  Yes!
[00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:53.122]  What's next?
[00:04:53.122 --> 00:04:55.203]  Kavanaugh sacrificed children?
[00:04:55.203 --> 00:04:56.164]  He drank their blood?
[00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.958]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:18.390]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:24.235]  Well, it kicked off at 8am this morning.
[00:06:25.663 --> 00:06:33.850]  And it's the Stand With Trump, Stand With Infowars, Stand With Free Speech, Stand With America Against The Globalist special broadcast.
[00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.711]  We're going for 16 hours today.
[00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:39.794]  We're normally here 10 hours a day with live broadcasts, 8 a.m.
[00:06:39.794 --> 00:06:40.435]  to 6 p.m.
[00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:42.436]  We have a lot of other special transmissions.
[00:06:42.436 --> 00:06:47.921]  But today, going on all the satellites and the radio stations and everybody, we're going to be going until midnight.
[00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:52.045]  We've got a whole raft of special guests.
[00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:54.667]  I'll give you the schedule coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:57.410]  We're going to post that up on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.996]  Stan with Trump, InfoWars all-day broadcast in support of saving the country.
[00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:09.202]  The Federal Reserve has come out and announced they're going to raise interest rates until the recovery stops.
[00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:13.227]  They say the economy's overheating.
[00:07:13.227 --> 00:07:15.549]  That means you might be able to pay off some of your debts.
[00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:17.530]  You might be able to pay off some of the national debt.
[00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.814]  The growth of the debt for the first time started to slow, and they just cannot have that.
[00:07:21.814 --> 00:07:36.404]  So they didn't raise interest rates under Obama, but they are now raising it six times, and they say they'll do it to end the, quote, accommodative policy era where they tried to stimulate the economy.
[00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:50.222]  But of course the policies of Obama, high regulations, only giving the 0% interest to big mega banks and large corporations, that was not meant to stimulate the general economy, but to vertically integrate it.
[00:07:54.895 --> 00:08:05.479]  Now, under Trump, he's gotten some of the policies changed where you're seeing record loans to small businesses, record small business startups, and that's why you're already seeing record profits in just 20 months in small businesses.
[00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:08.720]  That is a big, big deal.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.041]  Very, very serious situation that China
[00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:26.819]  has had basically zero interest rates for their companies for decades, but we can't have that anymore because Obama is out of office and Trump is in office now, and so we can't let America have a recovery.
[00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:32.261]  We can't show you what good old-fashioned Americana policies do.
[00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.641]  Look, the economists all know what works.
[00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:36.822]  Trump is doing what JFK did.
[00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:39.339]  The same policies.
[00:08:39.339 --> 00:08:41.520]  The Democrats used to have these policies.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.601]  But it empowers the little guy and they don't like that one bit.
[00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:50.642]  Now, let me give you a boil down to what's coming up.
[00:08:50.642 --> 00:08:57.843]  We've got some of the amazing clips of Trump at the UN, obviously, basically calling globalism out.
[00:08:57.843 --> 00:09:04.424]  We also have Trump exposing the entire Kavanaugh situation as a total fraud and a con job and a hoax.
[00:09:04.424 --> 00:09:07.305]  We're going to go to that first here in just a moment.
[00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:11.562]  We're going to look at the latest Kavanaugh accuser.
[00:09:11.562 --> 00:09:13.782]  When I'm on target, I'm on target.
[00:09:13.782 --> 00:09:28.826]  Did I not say last Tuesday, and the video is at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, if you want to go pull it up or just go to Reel.video, and it's there as well, Alex Jones predicts Democrats are going to roll out three more female accusers.
[00:09:32.557 --> 00:09:35.160]  Now we have the third accuser right on time.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.261]  This is such a snowball.
[00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:38.243]  Hell, I might be wrong.
[00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:45.671]  You might have 150 by Friday with the vote that Senator Grassley has scheduled.
[00:09:45.671 --> 00:09:51.898]  I mean, there may be women coming out saying that they saw Brett Kavanaugh literally
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.102]  Put suicide vest on children and have them march in and blow up churches.
[00:09:58.102 --> 00:10:00.283]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's Islam, so we can't talk about it.
[00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:03.765]  I mean, they may say they saw Kavanaugh sexually mutilate newborn girls.
[00:10:03.765 --> 00:10:05.526]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's radical Islam again.
[00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:10.769]  They may say they saw Kavanaugh at spirit cooking events, drinking blood, and worshipping Aleister Crowley.
[00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:14.091]  Oh, no, no, no, that's John Podesta and the Democrats.
[00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:21.735]  Hell, they may say Kavanaugh was a lawyer that represented hardcore child rapists, and that Kavanaugh bragged as a lawyer that he
[00:10:23.495 --> 00:10:31.700]  Had helped cover it up knowing the child rapist were guilty including Seven men that raped a 11 year old girl till her cervix was smashed.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:50.312]  I'm sorry that was Hillary We may learn that Kavanaugh flew on a jumbo jet 29 times without the Secret Service With a convicted pedophile that was videotaping world leaders having sex with little girls to blackmail him for Robert Mueller I'm sorry that was Bill Clinton again
[00:10:52.247 --> 00:10:56.430]  But see, none of those confirmed things matter.
[00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:03.176]  It's all these 36-year-old, no corroboration, all the stories fall apart.
[00:11:03.176 --> 00:11:06.579]  That's what we should be talking about.
[00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:13.384]  Not Hillary saying she came, she saw Gaddafi died, and hundreds of thousands died, including little girls, but the sex slavery.
[00:11:13.384 --> 00:11:14.525]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:14.525 --> 00:11:19.790]  It's the moral Democrats, the ones that want to sexualize your children through Hollywood.
[00:11:21.096 --> 00:11:43.288]  They're the ones that want to stop the evil, first in his class in college, first in his class in so many ways, and known as a total nerd, who was a virgin until his last year of college, according to all these witnesses and everyone that knows him on record and his own calendars showing that none of this is true, and his house, and his buddy's house wasn't where she said it was.
[00:11:43.288 --> 00:11:45.129]  It doesn't matter!
[00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:49.231]  Because Antovedi, a truly ferret-like man,
[00:11:50.805 --> 00:11:54.147]  A true scumbag.
[00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:56.628]  He says it's true.
[00:11:56.628 --> 00:12:01.491]  So that is the end of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:12.997]  He says this latest woman is courageous and brave and just amazing and all the feminist dog whistles that are totally fake of the women kept in slavery by the Democratic Party.
[00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:20.880]  Why did she go to parties where she said they ran trains on girls?
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.443]  Gang, gang, gang bangs.
[00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:27.545]  Now she calls it rape.
[00:12:27.545 --> 00:12:29.907]  But she never called the police or told anybody.
[00:12:29.907 --> 00:12:35.991]  And then she said she didn't like the parties because of the punch, so she wouldn't drink it, but still she went back a whole bunch and then she got raped.
[00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:45.736]  Now I'll tell you, I was at high school parties and stuff where people got drunk and I was never around spiking things with drugs.
[00:12:45.736 --> 00:12:49.119]  Everybody knew that was ever clear on the punch.
[00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:54.564]  Most of the times I went to those things, I wish I wouldn't have gone to them because I didn't end up face down in a hallway or something.
[00:12:54.564 --> 00:12:58.668]  There wasn't a lot of sex happening because people just got drunk and threw up all over the place.
[00:12:58.668 --> 00:13:02.251]  But that's not the kind of guy Kavanaugh was.
[00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:04.553]  I've always admitted it, that I partied quite a bit.
[00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:10.029]  Not into drugs, but alcohol was flowing freely.
[00:13:10.029 --> 00:13:14.991]  And there was vomiting going on, not sex.
[00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:16.452]  At least those kind of parties.
[00:13:16.452 --> 00:13:22.534]  I mean, I did have girlfriends, and I was promiscuous, and I'm not saying that's a good thing, but that was all consensual.
[00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:29.496]  This idea, though, that, oh, there were parties and there was drinking, and then there's no witnesses of him ever at any of these parties, it's crazy.
[00:13:29.496 --> 00:13:31.917]  And the president knocks it out of the park.
[00:13:31.917 --> 00:13:34.558]  This is a giant con game.
[00:13:36.397 --> 00:13:40.682]  This whole thing has giant holes in it.
[00:13:40.682 --> 00:13:44.287]  And it's all the 11th hour, 58 minute.
[00:13:44.287 --> 00:13:48.452]  This all gets rolled out now, not eight weeks ago when Kavanaugh first got announced.
[00:13:48.452 --> 00:13:53.258]  Let's go to the president.
[00:13:53.258 --> 00:13:54.280]  In less than two years.
[00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:57.840]  Give us some thoughts, sir.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.922]  I think he's just a wonderful human being.
[00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:03.064]  I mean, I think it's horrible what the Democrats have done.
[00:14:03.064 --> 00:14:04.706]  It's a con game they're playing.
[00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:06.367]  They're really con artists.
[00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:11.771]  They're trying to convince... You know, they don't believe it themselves, okay?
[00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:13.813]  They know he's a high-quality person.
[00:14:13.813 --> 00:14:15.234]  They don't believe him.
[00:14:15.234 --> 00:14:17.536]  It's just resist and obstruct.
[00:14:18.544 --> 00:14:20.605]  They're playing a con game.
[00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:21.766]  And they play it very well.
[00:14:21.766 --> 00:14:24.368]  They play it actually much better than the Republicans.
[00:14:24.368 --> 00:14:26.869]  They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy.
[00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:28.070]  They don't know what the hell they're doing.
[00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.811]  They want to get rid of ICE.
[00:14:29.811 --> 00:14:32.653]  They want to get rid of law enforcement.
[00:14:32.653 --> 00:14:34.815]  They don't want to take care of our military.
[00:14:34.815 --> 00:14:37.236]  They want to raise your taxes.
[00:14:37.236 --> 00:14:38.937]  But they're good at one thing.
[00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:39.858]  They're good at one thing.
[00:14:39.858 --> 00:14:44.961]  That's obstruction and resisting and con.
[00:14:44.961 --> 00:14:47.063]  And then he goes on to talk about
[00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:50.580]  How they know they're lying.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.780]  Schumer knows they're lying.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.121]  When we come back, I'm going to play the whole clip.
[00:14:55.121 --> 00:15:03.384]  But we're also then going to get into, as I said, Trump going to the UN and being laughed at.
[00:15:03.384 --> 00:15:05.945]  But I've watched the video several times and listened to it.
[00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:07.646]  Most of it sounds like good humor.
[00:15:08.823 --> 00:15:14.029]  So I don't think this is like him being laughed at at the Correspondents Dinner or other places.
[00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:16.371]  But that said, so what?
[00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.994]  The man in the arena gets laughed at.
[00:15:18.994 --> 00:15:21.577]  The man changing the world gets laughed at.
[00:15:21.577 --> 00:15:27.744]  So I have some very important things that we're going to be saying about this when we come back on the other side.
[00:15:27.744 --> 00:15:28.384]  Please remember,
[00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:30.266]  They're trying to censor us.
[00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:31.626]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:15:31.626 --> 00:15:35.829]  The entire power structure is obsessed with people not tuning into this broadcast.
[00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:43.553]  That's why, whether you're listening on local TV stations, watching on cable stations, radio stations, you've got to spread the word aggressively.
[00:15:43.553 --> 00:15:44.093]  And thank you.
[00:15:44.093 --> 00:15:45.094]  You've been doing it.
[00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:48.435]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com are really making a difference.
[00:15:48.435 --> 00:15:51.437]  They're trying to silence Americans, these globalists, ahead of the elections.
[00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:52.618]  And we're not going to let them.
[00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:53.878]  You're not going to let them.
[00:15:53.878 --> 00:15:55.699]  And so you've certainly joined the fight.
[00:15:55.699 --> 00:15:56.640]  You've risen to the challenge.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.402]  And I want to thank the listeners and viewers for the great job they're doing.

[00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:35.774]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:17:35.774 --> 00:17:38.676]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:17:38.676 --> 00:17:42.258]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[00:18:00.307 --> 00:18:03.908]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.908 --> 00:18:05.688]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.688 --> 00:18:17.730]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:26.472]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.912 --> 00:18:32.876]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.876 --> 00:18:37.979]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:40.600]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.321]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:52.327]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.327 --> 00:18:54.429]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[00:18:54.969 --> 00:19:00.293]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.293 --> 00:19:08.699]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:19:08.699 --> 00:19:10.160]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.463]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:14.463 --> 00:19:17.946]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarsstore.com,
[00:19:18.406 --> 00:19:20.087]  I still have that energy.
[00:19:20.087 --> 00:19:40.243]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:19:40.743 --> 00:19:44.746]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[00:19:44.746 --> 00:19:48.408]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:53.411]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[00:19:53.411 --> 00:19:56.153]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[00:19:56.153 --> 00:20:02.897]  Supermail Vitality from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:02.897 --> 00:20:05.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.852]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:02.852 --> 00:21:04.332]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:21:04.332 --> 00:21:19.657]  Michael Graves, former lead singer of the Misfits, banned from major music festival in England for tweeting Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson articles and videos, will be joining us to talk about the total war on free speech and where he thinks it's going and how we should fight back.
[00:21:20.137 --> 00:21:34.587]  Then Leo Zagami is going to be joining us, the latest on the real pedo-rains and the real raping of children by thousands of priests and their little satanic pedophile army that's taken over the Catholic Church that the leftist media totally ignores and totally covers up.
[00:21:34.587 --> 00:21:36.008]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:21:36.008 --> 00:21:47.455]  And we also have Vox Dei joining us, Roger Stone and so much more right through the big list of guests that we have that I will tell you about at the start of the next segment.
[00:21:47.455 --> 00:21:49.637]  So please print me that list, guys, so I have that.
[00:21:49.637 --> 00:21:49.937]  Thank you.
[00:21:50.338 --> 00:21:53.648]  It's also listed up on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:53.648 --> 00:21:56.698]  Now I'm going to get to a boil down here in a moment of
[00:21:58.493 --> 00:22:04.196]  People laughing at the president in the past and in the present, and laughing at others like Nigel Farage.
[00:22:04.196 --> 00:22:07.438]  So it's good to be laughed at and then laughed last.
[00:22:07.438 --> 00:22:17.545]  But first I want to play a clip from a Michelle Obama speech that's linked up on DrudgeReport.com right now, the full speech, where she just says some unbelievable things.
[00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:23.548]  She encourages people who quote, know nothing about nothing to vote.
[00:22:23.548 --> 00:22:24.549]  I'm not kidding, here it is.
[00:22:25.276 --> 00:22:30.020]  And voting does not require any kind of special expertise.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.564]  You don't need to have some fancy degree to be qualified to vote.
[00:22:35.564 --> 00:22:40.168]  You don't have to read every news article to be qualified to vote.
[00:22:40.168 --> 00:22:42.830]  You know what you need to be qualified to vote?
[00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.851]  You need to be a citizen.
[00:22:45.923 --> 00:22:48.364]  You need to be a part of this country.
[00:22:48.364 --> 00:22:52.005]  You need to have opinions about the issues in your community.
[00:22:52.005 --> 00:22:53.646]  That's what qualifies you to vote.
[00:22:53.646 --> 00:22:58.807]  Caring about your kid's future qualifies you to be a voter.
[00:22:58.807 --> 00:23:03.669]  Wanting a say in what happens in this country qualifies you to be a voter.
[00:23:06.405 --> 00:23:07.586]  So don't be intimidated.
[00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:12.189]  Don't let somebody intimidate you from being a part of this process.
[00:23:12.189 --> 00:23:15.691]  I've been voting since I was 18 years old.
[00:23:15.691 --> 00:23:19.954]  And trust me, I didn't know nothing about nothing at 18 years old.
[00:23:19.954 --> 00:23:22.556]  But you know how to control slaves now, don't you?
[00:23:22.556 --> 00:23:25.918]  The big megabanks and the chi-coms, the biggest slave masters on earth.
[00:23:25.918 --> 00:23:28.260]  Oh, we're intimidating you from voting.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.060]  Bull!
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.322]  It's the Democrats out intimidating everybody.
[00:23:31.322 --> 00:23:34.324]  Here is President Trump at the United Nations yesterday.
[00:23:34.324 --> 00:23:35.425]  I think more
[00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:48.613]  Being you know being laughed at because you know what he's saying is interesting But also he's in David Rockefeller's house the big headquarters of globalism in the lion's den so you decide for yourself One year ago.
[00:23:48.613 --> 00:24:05.343]  I stood before you for the first time in this Grand Hall I Addressed the threats facing our world and I presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for all of humanity
[00:24:07.455 --> 00:24:15.023]  Today I stand before the United Nations General Assembly to share the extraordinary progress we've made.
[00:24:15.023 --> 00:24:28.377]  In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.
[00:24:28.377 --> 00:24:30.059]  America is so true.
[00:24:35.959 --> 00:24:41.561]  Didn't expect that reaction, but that's okay.
[00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:43.442]  Oh yeah, they're laughing because they like him.
[00:24:43.442 --> 00:24:45.823]  That's jovial.
[00:24:45.823 --> 00:24:47.604]  Donald Trump!
[00:24:47.604 --> 00:24:54.326]  I heard they were making fun of him a few years ago.
[00:24:54.326 --> 00:25:05.511]  No, I know that he's taken some flack lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald.
[00:25:07.585 --> 00:25:13.108]  And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter.
[00:25:13.108 --> 00:25:16.891]  Like, did we fake the moon landing?
[00:25:16.891 --> 00:25:23.655]  What really happened in Roswell?
[00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:25.256]  And where are Biggie and Tupac?
[00:25:37.512 --> 00:25:45.937]  All kidding aside, obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience.
[00:25:45.937 --> 00:26:00.565]  For example, no seriously, just recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice at the Steakhouse, the men's cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks.
[00:26:02.611 --> 00:26:10.078]  And there was a lot of blame to go around, but you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership.
[00:26:10.078 --> 00:26:16.104]  And so, ultimately, you didn't blame Little John or Meatloaf.
[00:26:16.104 --> 00:26:17.466]  You fired Gary Busey.
[00:26:17.466 --> 00:26:22.851]  Stop that for a moment.
[00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:24.373]  Now, again, notice what's happening here.
[00:26:25.683 --> 00:26:28.586]  The maverick runs, beats them, turns the economy around.
[00:26:28.586 --> 00:26:30.788]  This is absolutely delicious.
[00:26:30.788 --> 00:26:40.537]  Now let's go to Nigel Farage, who they laughed at when he said they would cause the EU to collapse and pull out of the unelected system.
[00:26:40.537 --> 00:26:41.418]  And now they're not laughing.
[00:26:43.152 --> 00:26:44.253]  Isn't it funny?
[00:26:44.253 --> 00:26:56.768]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me.
[00:26:56.768 --> 00:27:00.272]  Well, I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?
[00:27:00.272 --> 00:27:01.714]  And the reason you're so upset
[00:27:03.544 --> 00:27:09.789]  The reason you're so angry has been perfectly clear from all the angry exchanges this morning.
[00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:14.092]  You, as a political project, are in denial.
[00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:17.454]  You're in denial that your currency is failing.
[00:27:17.454 --> 00:27:22.958]  You're in denial... Well, just look at the Mediterranean!
[00:27:26.471 --> 00:27:31.315]  As a policy to impose poverty on Greece and the rest of the Mediterranean, you've done very well.
[00:27:31.315 --> 00:27:46.387]  And you're in denial over Mrs. Merkel's call last year for as many people as possible to cross the Mediterranean into the European Union, has led to massive divisions between countries and within countries.
[00:27:46.387 --> 00:27:49.170]  But the biggest problem you've got, and the reason
[00:27:49.910 --> 00:28:07.550]  The main reason the United Kingdom voted the way that it did is you have, by stealth, by deception, without ever telling the truth to the British or the rest of the peoples of Europe, you have imposed upon them a political union.
[00:28:09.238 --> 00:28:11.899]  You've imposed upon them a political union.
[00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:26.007]  And when the people, in 2005, in the Netherlands and France, voted against that political union, when they rejected the Constitution, you simply ignored them and brought the Lisbon Treaty in through the back door.
[00:28:26.007 --> 00:28:31.190]  Alright, and we have other clips where Don Lemon then says Trump's a loser, the whole world's laughing at him.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.161]  That's called leadership.
[00:28:34.161 --> 00:28:36.561]  And so, who's laughing now?
[00:28:36.561 --> 00:28:42.463]  That's all they use is sophomoric ridicule and demonization attacks to make us not be leaders.
[00:28:42.463 --> 00:28:48.645]  But leadership is doing the right thing and not going with the pack of cowards and pack of jellyfish.
[00:28:48.645 --> 00:28:54.787]  So I'm proud of everybody that stood against these bullies and we're winning and we're changing history yet again.
[00:28:54.787 --> 00:28:55.887]  We are the Mavericks.
[00:28:55.887 --> 00:28:56.948]  We are the Trailblazers.
[00:28:56.948 --> 00:28:57.868]  Not John McCain.
[00:28:59.455 --> 00:29:02.336]  Ever wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[00:29:02.336 --> 00:29:07.238]  Vercell Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.
[00:29:07.238 --> 00:29:12.820]  Decentralized blockchain solutions are making the world more transparent and giving power back to the people.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:21.064]  Vercell Media has helped companies raise tens of millions in the past year alone, structuring and marketing ICOs to the thirsty crypto public worldwide.

[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:09.843]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the Info War to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[00:31:09.843 --> 00:31:13.344]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[00:31:13.344 --> 00:31:22.867]  to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[00:31:22.867 --> 00:31:30.050]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being the number one
[00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:30.750]  We're good to go.
[00:31:59.928 --> 00:32:03.846]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:32:05.194 --> 00:32:13.876]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:32:13.876 --> 00:32:15.857]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:32:15.857 --> 00:32:19.318]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:32:19.318 --> 00:32:21.938]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:32:21.938 --> 00:32:24.219]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:32:24.219 --> 00:32:31.181]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:41.526]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:42.706]  We'll win.
[00:32:42.706 --> 00:32:45.527]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:32:45.527 --> 00:32:52.751]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:32:52.751 --> 00:32:56.453]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[00:32:56.453 --> 00:32:58.013]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:32:58.013 --> 00:32:58.694]  We need your support.
[00:32:58.694 --> 00:32:59.414]  I'm counting on you.
[00:33:03.866 --> 00:33:06.452]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:49.326]  We have 41 days till this do or die situation.
[00:33:49.326 --> 00:33:59.635]  And everybody needs to be on the right side of history right now to try to bring back sovereignty, bring back free market, bring back real debate, real free speech like President Trump and others are doing.
[00:34:00.859 --> 00:34:09.224]  And yes, to take a line from the original Misfits, this is where eagles dare to be public and to be supporting Western civilization.
[00:34:09.224 --> 00:34:19.109]  Now, I know of our guests quite a bit because growing up from the time I was like 10 years old, I liked hard rock, heavy metal, and I liked good punk rock, and I really liked the Misfits.
[00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:22.651]  And then I learned, about 12 or 13, that all the wild girls were into it.
[00:34:22.651 --> 00:34:25.293]  So I've been to many Misfits concerts.
[00:34:25.293 --> 00:34:26.433]  I've been to all of them.
[00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:27.474]  I mean, I've been to a lot of it.
[00:34:27.794 --> 00:34:31.118]  With this guy fronting, Glenn Danzig, you name it.
[00:34:31.118 --> 00:34:44.034]  And so, I'm not really a fanboy, usually trying to get musicians and people on, but when I really like the band, and when somebody's being persecuted for free speech, promoting us, well then, it's amazing.
[00:34:44.034 --> 00:34:45.215]  So, I'm excited.
[00:34:45.215 --> 00:34:47.598]  By the way, I haven't chimed in on Willie Nelson, who I'm good friends with.
[00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:50.840]  I caught our side attacking him.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.521]  He's 85 now for backing Beto.
[00:34:53.521 --> 00:34:55.262]  That's his right to do that.
[00:34:55.262 --> 00:34:57.763]  We have a right to think he's an idiot, but he's not.
[00:34:57.763 --> 00:34:59.504]  I had dinner with him five years ago.
[00:34:59.504 --> 00:35:00.544]  He's senile.
[00:35:00.544 --> 00:35:02.205]  So leave Willie Nelson alone.
[00:35:02.205 --> 00:35:03.366]  I can tell you right now.
[00:35:03.366 --> 00:35:04.906]  So I'm just going to stop right there.
[00:35:04.906 --> 00:35:06.527]  You can attack Willie Nelson if you want.
[00:35:06.527 --> 00:35:07.668]  I'm not attacking Willie Nelson.
[00:35:08.488 --> 00:35:15.196]  Uh, because, uh, I mean, there I am five years ago, had dinner with him, and he was not the Willie Nelson I knew for ten years before.
[00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:17.739]  So let's just say that he was gone five years ago.
[00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:23.845]  So, I'm not being mean about that, but whatever he does now, it's his fifth wife, who I'm not knocking, I know her too.
[00:35:23.845 --> 00:35:24.666]  Okay, let's stop there.
[00:35:25.629 --> 00:35:27.489]  Joining us is Michael Graves.
[00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:32.110]  Paul Watson put out a video a few days ago, and I was blown away by it, that this happened.
[00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.131]  And I think it's best that he just tell the story, but this is big news.
[00:35:35.131 --> 00:35:40.712]  Former Misfits singer, appearance cancelled after social media review.
[00:35:40.712 --> 00:35:42.253]  Michael Graves.
[00:35:42.253 --> 00:35:44.453]  And oh my gosh, they have this big music festival.
[00:35:44.453 --> 00:35:46.593]  I know because Paul's brother is into music festivals.
[00:35:46.593 --> 00:35:48.634]  He covers them and runs major festivals.
[00:35:48.634 --> 00:35:51.774]  Doesn't run this one, that's Steve Watson, Moonlight says.
[00:35:51.774 --> 00:35:52.715]  That's his real job.
[00:35:54.415 --> 00:35:59.779]  This is a big deal because they said we reviewed him and it's white supremacy and all this made up crap.
[00:35:59.779 --> 00:36:02.021]  They're almost like, you know, this guy or that guy.
[00:36:02.021 --> 00:36:05.564]  And so he's still going to be playing in the town, but this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[00:36:05.564 --> 00:36:06.585]  And what did he get in trouble for?
[00:36:06.585 --> 00:36:08.907]  Well, here he is to tell us right now.
[00:36:08.907 --> 00:36:11.008]  So, Michael, I've enjoyed a lot of your music.
[00:36:11.008 --> 00:36:12.329]  My wife loves your music.
[00:36:12.329 --> 00:36:15.272]  She thinks you're even better than Glenn Danzig.
[00:36:15.272 --> 00:36:17.293]  I think that's impossible, but you're both amazing.
[00:36:17.293 --> 00:36:17.914]  It's good to have you here.
[00:36:18.925 --> 00:36:19.585]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:24.508]  Thank you very much for having me on your show and for coming to my defense.
[00:36:24.508 --> 00:36:26.089]  I appreciate it very, very much.
[00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:33.114]  Well, do you know how much tail the Misfits has gotten me?
[00:36:33.114 --> 00:36:34.735]  How much?
[00:36:34.735 --> 00:36:39.097]  Well, back in the day, back in the 80s, 90s, I mean, that was where all the hot girls were.
[00:36:39.097 --> 00:36:40.958]  Still is pretty hot, you know.
[00:36:40.958 --> 00:36:41.399]  Yes, sir.
[00:36:42.358 --> 00:36:46.879]  Okay, seriously though, let's get into what happened to you, because this is dangerous, and it just shows it's happening everywhere.
[00:36:46.879 --> 00:36:51.001]  They reviewed your social media, like they reviewed your DNA or something.
[00:36:51.001 --> 00:36:52.361]  This is what sounds Nazi to me.
[00:36:52.361 --> 00:36:57.143]  Yeah, Alex, it really came out of the clear blue sky.
[00:36:57.143 --> 00:37:11.347]  My tour manager is also my guitar player, and we had a day off and we were working on some business, and we found out about what happened after the festival had posted it, that they had
[00:37:12.276 --> 00:37:25.505]  Like you've said, reviewed my social sites and mainly saw retweets from Paul Joseph Watson, from Infowars, from Breitbart, on and on.
[00:37:25.505 --> 00:37:29.367]  And, you know, it's not just one person.
[00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:34.811]  It was and is a board of nine that freaked out.
[00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:43.656]  Over this and it really is a sign of the times out because about 10 years ago I went out on tour and did more than 50 states across America.
[00:37:43.656 --> 00:37:45.460]  It was called the war of information tour.
[00:37:46.469 --> 00:38:00.058]  And me and my guys, we were handing out InfoWars magazines, bumper stickers that other patriots would bring to us that they had stockpiled from ordering through InfoWars.
[00:38:00.058 --> 00:38:04.001]  And we were disseminating the information and getting the word out.
[00:38:04.001 --> 00:38:05.842]  And no one said boo.
[00:38:05.842 --> 00:38:09.585]  No one cared that what we were doing.
[00:38:09.585 --> 00:38:12.387]  Now jump to where we are in 2018 and
[00:38:16.863 --> 00:38:21.185]  This is a dangerous thing to come on your show like this.
[00:38:21.185 --> 00:38:27.989]  This will have repercussions, as everyone's seen, just from retweeting.
[00:38:27.989 --> 00:38:43.058]  Anybody that's ever come to any of my shows, from the Misfit days forward, whether I'm playing acoustic or not, in any form that I perform, I do not make any statements from the stage.
[00:38:43.058 --> 00:38:44.038]  It's not about that.
[00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:52.260]  So yeah, I was discriminated against when my social sites were reviewed.
[00:38:53.779 --> 00:39:10.689]  And I love how all the left, which isn't even the left, are these authoritarians, because I know you guys have been critical of the right wing as well when they're authoritarians, so am I. They're just oppressing everyone and lying about who we are when they do it, and then literally trying to send a chilling effect to everybody, you better keep your mouth shut or we'll ruin you.
[00:39:10.689 --> 00:39:15.812]  So you're right, you really are sticking your neck out here in a whole sea of cowards out there.
[00:39:15.812 --> 00:39:20.755]  But it's also, I think, a greater danger if we don't start sticking our necks out, because this is getting out of control.
[00:39:22.995 --> 00:39:34.504]  I agree with you, Alex, and like you say, in the arena that you're in, you've hit the barbed wire for a lot of people, and we all appreciate that, and I certainly appreciate that.
[00:39:34.504 --> 00:39:45.553]  You and your entire organization has given me, and a lot of other people, the courage to as well, in the arena that I fight in, music and art, cultural expression,
[00:39:46.153 --> 00:39:48.674]  To hit the barbed wire as well.
[00:39:48.674 --> 00:39:52.676]  And I hope that, and I know that there's other Patriots out there.
[00:39:52.676 --> 00:39:57.378]  There's a lot of young people that are paying attention to this, other bands, other artists.
[00:39:57.378 --> 00:40:15.146]  And the attack on me and seeing what I do and being articulate and being informed about it is going to give the courage and the cover for other artists, other musicians to do this, regardless of the consequences.
[00:40:16.488 --> 00:40:30.265]  I just can't believe in America and in England in 2018, like you said, that it's a courageous act to keep your politics separate from the music overall, but to put out some tweets about some news articles, and then they come and review you, and then this persecution.
[00:40:30.265 --> 00:40:34.611]  Now James Woods is still locked out of Twitter, and every few hours somebody else I know is being banned.
[00:40:35.151 --> 00:40:35.872]  Yeah, I get Alex.
[00:40:57.423 --> 00:41:07.987]  Three months before the election, the top professors, right, on PsyOps were telling Hillary that they need to expand the culture war and cultural division.
[00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:10.207]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:41:10.207 --> 00:41:14.349]  And that's exactly what's happening here.
[00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:15.889]  I'm not that big of a deal.
[00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:19.670]  I'm kind of a small blip on the radar.
[00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:24.972]  So again, like I tweeted out, I'm a canary in the coal mine as well.
[00:41:24.972 --> 00:41:26.053]  If this can happen to me,
[00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:38.136]  It can and will happen to anybody else that comes out, if you will, as a conservative.
[00:41:38.136 --> 00:41:53.103]  That being said, it's important right now to be courageous and to push back and to speak and be articulate and informed and empowered by all this.
[00:41:53.103 --> 00:41:54.864]  Because I'm a perfect example.
[00:41:54.864 --> 00:41:56.985]  Alex, I've been listening to you a long time.
[00:41:58.206 --> 00:42:06.451]  And when this happened, yourself and many other great patriots have come to my defense and I'm so thankful.
[00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:12.260]  Oh, listen, it's self-preservation at the same time, but it is good to be in this club.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:21.242]  The great crew I've got, the great audience of actors, people like you, always getting to meet other folks that are real mavericks and just have integrity and aren't going to bow to this.
[00:42:21.242 --> 00:42:25.483]  But in China, they'll arrest you if you criticize the economy.
[00:42:25.483 --> 00:42:33.605]  Here, they ban you off Twitter or Facebook if you promote the economy, which shows at least the communist Chinese are for their own system.
[00:42:33.605 --> 00:42:35.666]  The people running our country are trying to.
[00:42:36.781 --> 00:42:41.163]  Are totally pissed off that we want to be successful, showing they're trying to demoralize us.
[00:42:41.163 --> 00:42:50.968]  I want to ask you what you think the backlash will be, and how serious this will get before we turn the corner, and can we save civilization, with the former head of the Misfits, Michael Graves, straight ahead.
[00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:52.449]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[00:42:52.449 --> 00:42:54.410]  Officialmichaelgraves.com is the website.
[00:42:59.437 --> 00:43:03.402]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.402 --> 00:43:06.686]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.686 --> 00:43:12.973]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.973 --> 00:43:15.736]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.457 --> 00:43:20.279]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.279 --> 00:43:26.764]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.764 --> 00:43:31.727]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.478 --> 00:43:36.399]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.399 --> 00:43:43.582]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.582 --> 00:43:48.283]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.283 --> 00:43:54.505]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.505 --> 00:43:58.467]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.227 --> 00:44:19.217]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:44:19.217 --> 00:44:21.338]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:44:21.338 --> 00:44:25.320]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.541]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[00:44:26.781 --> 00:44:32.565]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:44:32.565 --> 00:44:34.967]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:44:34.967 --> 00:44:40.390]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.892]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:42.892 --> 00:44:52.078]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:44:52.078 --> 00:44:56.521]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:44:56.841 --> 00:45:08.724]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:45:08.724 --> 00:45:10.184]  Believe me, I know.
[00:45:10.184 --> 00:45:14.505]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:45:14.505 --> 00:45:19.906]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at InfoWareStore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:45:20.126 --> 00:45:40.278]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:47:03.388 --> 00:47:15.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:20.786]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:47:20.786 --> 00:47:23.108]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:24.617 --> 00:47:31.465]  This magic moment was so different and so new.
[00:47:31.465 --> 00:47:36.650]  It was like any other until I kissed you.
[00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.694]  And then it happened.
[00:47:39.694 --> 00:47:41.696]  It took me by surprise.
[00:47:58.351 --> 00:47:58.631]  Good stuff.
[00:47:58.631 --> 00:48:07.963]  You probably recognize a lot of this guy's music in our bumper music because usually you got like a super iconic band like the Misfits and then the next singer's not as good.
[00:48:07.963 --> 00:48:09.065]  Or they copied the last guy.
[00:48:09.065 --> 00:48:09.806]  Well, he didn't do that.
[00:48:09.806 --> 00:48:12.048]  He's just as good as Glenn Danzig in my view.
[00:48:12.048 --> 00:48:14.291]  And I love the album with
[00:48:15.172 --> 00:48:16.113]  All the 50s stuff on it.
[00:48:16.113 --> 00:48:18.034]  I actually bought that one.
[00:48:18.034 --> 00:48:21.437]  And I've been listening to that for a long, long, long time.
[00:48:21.437 --> 00:48:27.141]  I was actually listening to it hiking in the Grand Canyon when I slipped off a cliff edge and blew my Achilles.
[00:48:27.141 --> 00:48:29.383]  That's a funny, funny story.
[00:48:29.383 --> 00:48:33.326]  But as you definitely remember the song you have when you blow your Achilles.
[00:48:33.326 --> 00:48:35.307]  Michael Graves here, officialmichaelgraves.com.
[00:48:36.588 --> 00:48:42.271]  As George Orwell said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:48:42.271 --> 00:48:55.399]  And so here he is, banned from a big music festival because he tweeted Breitbart and Alex Jones, InfoWars and Paul Watson talking about the discrimination against white people, which you've got the board member at the New York Times.
[00:48:56.319 --> 00:49:00.923]  At the time he tweeted, you know, saying whites are these subhuman creatures that live in goblin holes.
[00:49:00.923 --> 00:49:10.589]  And then you've got an article today with this MSNBC host is being sued because she just randomly said some white lady was a racist and was a subhuman and should be killed.
[00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:13.992]  And I don't dislike people because they have brown skin.
[00:49:13.992 --> 00:49:19.656]  But then when the media turns them into racists and they say I'm subhuman, it sounds like something Hitler said.
[00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:23.879]  And then I say it's wrong or Michael Graves says it and then he's banned.
[00:49:23.879 --> 00:49:25.280]  This is getting crazy, Michael.
[00:49:27.981 --> 00:49:37.334]  Alex, I'm on a street level and in a lot of ways it is getting crazy, especially in the art and music community.
[00:49:37.334 --> 00:49:39.157]  What makes this situation
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:49.646]  Uh, particularly dangerous is because it was coming from somebody that works within city government as as well.
[00:49:49.646 --> 00:49:55.789]  That's kind of being left out of the story on this individual who is on this board of nine.
[00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:59.211]  And we only know one of the names.
[00:49:59.211 --> 00:50:02.834]  The other eight have remained anonymous.
[00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:08.377]  But this individual is the director of cultural services in the city.
[00:50:08.377 --> 00:50:08.517]  Now,
[00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:22.035]  I don't think that it's too hard to imagine that this person's ideology and the things that he believes don't then bleed over into the art and music community as a whole.
[00:50:22.035 --> 00:50:24.776]  To me, that's very, very dangerous.
[00:50:24.776 --> 00:50:39.359]  I'm trying to change the world for the good and to lift people up and to make them feel good about themselves through music and art to get us out of this hole.
[00:50:40.351 --> 00:50:46.117]  Um, you know, junk in junk out, right?
[00:50:46.117 --> 00:51:03.355]  So you have all of these folks that are in the, uh, the music and art community who are, uh, authoritarian, they're, uh, raging leftists, um, that, that put that mindset and that ideology into the minds of, of young people.
[00:51:04.668 --> 00:51:16.834]  With all their inclusive policies, all this crazy anti-discrimination stuff that just breeds fear into the minds of people in general.
[00:51:16.834 --> 00:51:20.056]  And I think it creates racism on both sides.
[00:51:20.056 --> 00:51:21.296]  It definitely does.
[00:51:21.296 --> 00:51:23.377]  It polarizes people on both sides.
[00:51:23.377 --> 00:51:25.938]  You see it on the social sites.
[00:51:25.938 --> 00:51:27.099]  You see it on Facebook.
[00:51:27.099 --> 00:51:30.841]  And as you mentioned, it's in the WikiLeaks that that was their plan.
[00:51:30.841 --> 00:51:31.561]  Absolutely.
[00:51:31.561 --> 00:51:32.822]  That's the truth, Alex.
[00:51:34.451 --> 00:51:42.020]  But the good news is that there are more of us than there are of them in music and in art.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:42.740]  And that's the truth.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.763]  There's more of us than than them.
[00:51:44.763 --> 00:51:55.475]  And it's just that, again, people like me are giving courage and giving cover to all of those people who are afraid.
[00:51:56.058 --> 00:51:58.139]  To come out and say anything.
[00:51:58.139 --> 00:51:58.839]  I have children.
[00:51:58.839 --> 00:51:59.979]  I have a family, Alex.
[00:51:59.979 --> 00:52:01.319]  Young children.
[00:52:01.319 --> 00:52:07.601]  This is, if I can't do this, I can't, you know, I got to take care of my family.
[00:52:07.601 --> 00:52:09.881]  I got to take care of myself.
[00:52:09.881 --> 00:52:25.625]  And so leftists, like the one that has come up against me, are doing the same thing in a very small way that's being done to you and all the other conservatives that we see being banned.
[00:52:26.556 --> 00:52:29.517]  And censored, and discriminated against, and attacked.
[00:52:46.621 --> 00:52:47.222]  away from us.
[00:52:47.222 --> 00:52:48.723]  In seven working days, that's gone.
[00:52:48.723 --> 00:52:51.505]  They're trying to target our other payment processors right now.
[00:52:51.505 --> 00:53:06.337]  I mean, so they're going after us, and you mentioned the key here, and then we'll get back into that question that I just asked, that I have big tech working with the Democrats, and I have hearings in the Senate and House saying, we want Alex Jones taken off the air, and executives go, we'll get right on that, sir.
[00:53:07.623 --> 00:53:09.985]  And then, a month later, I'm banned.
[00:53:09.985 --> 00:53:20.892]  So I'm watching C-SPAN, they're lying about me, saying things I never said, using the straw man to then ban me, and they admit then, once we get Jones, we'll be able to shut anybody down.
[00:53:20.892 --> 00:53:22.653]  And now it's happened!
[00:53:22.653 --> 00:53:27.216]  And so in a sick way, they're using me as propaganda, they're using the cartoon image they've spun or edited.
[00:53:28.408 --> 00:53:32.212]  To then, even though I want to help people, I kind of feel guilty.
[00:53:32.212 --> 00:53:35.975]  They're using the cartoon image of me having fun now against everybody.
[00:53:35.975 --> 00:53:38.577]  That's why I'm telling folks, hey, my plight is your plight.
[00:53:38.577 --> 00:53:40.659]  I'm not just saying that to get you on board with me.
[00:53:40.659 --> 00:53:44.803]  I'm telling you folks, I am the first domino.
[00:53:44.803 --> 00:53:47.866]  Brother, you are enemy number one.
[00:53:47.866 --> 00:53:49.547]  You are enemy number one.
[00:53:49.547 --> 00:53:52.069]  And they have weaponized language.
[00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:53.751]  So you say Alex Jones?
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.100]  And people freak out.
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.741]  Doesn't matter what you're saying.
[00:53:57.741 --> 00:54:02.082]  You say Alex Jones in full wars, people freak out.
[00:54:02.082 --> 00:54:17.807]  Conservative, again, Breitbart, NRA, all of these words to the ill-informed or the under-informed, the lower IQ audience, if you will, it just creates an emotional response.
[00:54:17.807 --> 00:54:22.388]  And which is what's supposed to happen.
[00:54:23.615 --> 00:54:26.436]  They're programmed to react that way.
[00:54:26.436 --> 00:54:28.717]  So that they just freak out.
[00:54:28.717 --> 00:54:31.938]  And again, the example is what happened to me.
[00:54:31.938 --> 00:54:37.200]  And this board of nine up in Canada have admitted that.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.181]  That they saw that I was tweeting Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:40.181 --> 00:54:41.642]  They saw Alex Jones.
[00:54:41.642 --> 00:54:46.883]  I had made a video with one of my songs and one of your monologues.
[00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:48.644]  And they just freaked out.
[00:54:48.644 --> 00:54:49.264]  Oh, I'm honored.
[00:54:49.264 --> 00:54:50.065]  What album is that?
[00:54:50.065 --> 00:54:50.525]  I want to hear that.
[00:54:50.525 --> 00:54:51.065]  I want to play that.
[00:54:52.344 --> 00:54:54.168]  It's called The Truth About Alex Jones.
[00:54:54.168 --> 00:54:56.953]  It's an acoustic song called Ghost.
[00:54:56.953 --> 00:55:01.983]  And it was a wonderful rant, a wonderful monologue that you did right around Christmas time.
[00:55:02.865 --> 00:55:08.969]  Um, it's up on my Facebook, and I'll certainly... Oh, we'll play it, because here's the deal, I'll be honest.
[00:55:08.969 --> 00:55:10.130]  I just work all the time now.
[00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:15.173]  I might watch a show with my wife a couple times a week, or, you know, listen to stuff that's already on Spotify, even though they banned me.
[00:55:15.173 --> 00:55:20.416]  But I had no idea, though, because I'm really honored, because I love your music, and I've listened to, I mean, all your albums that I knew of.
[00:55:20.416 --> 00:55:21.377]  I didn't know you'd done that.
[00:55:21.377 --> 00:55:23.758]  So I've definitely got to go download that right now.
[00:55:23.758 --> 00:55:25.239]  So it's called The Truth About Alex Jones.
[00:55:25.239 --> 00:55:31.543]  I wonder if that'll be banned off Spotify, because they just banned, like, 20 apps that had Infowars in the name off Apple last month.
[00:55:34.239 --> 00:55:40.106]  I have to assume Alex that I'm soon going to be taken down off of Twitter and Facebook as well.
[00:55:40.106 --> 00:55:43.831]  I've already gotten a whole bunch of messages from followers.
[00:55:43.831 --> 00:55:50.019]  I have almost 11,000 followers and a lot of them, I get messages all the time that nobody sees my tweets.
[00:55:50.019 --> 00:55:51.140]  I put stuff up and
[00:55:52.061 --> 00:56:15.958]  It's it's and that's why everybody's got to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email because more and more that's the only way we have a comedian coming on tonight Owen Benjamin he sells out 2,000 person arenas everywhere but he's banned online because he says don't sexualize kids from the left and so he's banned you know he's been a top national comedian but he but he has to use email to get to him and announce the show the day of they buy their tickets
[00:56:16.658 --> 00:56:18.739]  Talk about fight club, and then you go that day.
[00:56:18.739 --> 00:56:23.420]  So same thing, how do people sign up to get your verboten information?
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:28.681]  Michael Graves, former frontman for the Misfits, and now of course he has many other incarnations.
[00:56:28.681 --> 00:56:29.982]  How do people follow what you're doing?
[00:56:29.982 --> 00:56:32.243]  Officialmichaelgraves.com?
[00:56:32.243 --> 00:56:37.484]  Officialmichaelgraves.com is the best place to go for all things Michael Graves.
[00:56:37.484 --> 00:56:39.865]  And I've been told the next thing is they're going after our URL.
[00:56:39.865 --> 00:56:42.085]  So folks, you've got to sign up for the email.
[00:56:42.085 --> 00:56:43.966]  And I'm sure you have an email list people can sign up for.
[00:56:44.963 --> 00:56:46.524]  Yes, yup, it's right on the website.
[00:57:02.699 --> 00:57:05.202]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're under total attack.
[00:57:05.202 --> 00:57:07.365]  But this is where I want to be.
[00:57:07.365 --> 00:57:16.135]  It's like, you know, General Kelly talks about one of his sons getting killed in the Marine Corps, and he's actually proud of him, even though he was his favorite son, because it's where his son wanted to be.
[00:57:16.135 --> 00:57:19.539]  Well, I'm not, like Tommy Robinson, about to be sent to prison tomorrow.
[00:57:19.539 --> 00:57:20.480]  He's coming up later, by the way.
[00:57:21.261 --> 00:57:23.622]  I'm not at that level yet, okay?
[00:57:23.622 --> 00:57:24.662]  I don't want to be that level.
[00:57:24.662 --> 00:57:25.103]  But you know what?
[00:57:25.103 --> 00:57:27.344]  If I've got to go to that level, I'm very honored to be there.
[00:57:27.344 --> 00:57:29.104]  I don't want it, but you know what?
[00:57:29.104 --> 00:57:30.905]  Side of me is like, let's get it on, man.
[00:57:30.905 --> 00:57:33.166]  It's like when a bully said, I'm going to be waiting for you after school.
[00:57:33.166 --> 00:57:35.107]  I could have got on that bus and not, you know what?
[00:57:35.107 --> 00:57:37.568]  You may be four years older than me and think you're going to weigh 100 pounds.
[00:57:37.568 --> 00:57:38.848]  I'm going to beat your ass.
[00:57:38.848 --> 00:57:41.029]  We're going to see what's going to happen, or I'm going to die crying.
[00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:44.090]  We'll be right back with our number two, Infowars.com.
[00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:45.971]  Newswars.com, get this new t-shirt.

[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:55.956]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:07.876 --> 01:00:10.898]  You know, there's a lot of different types of liberals.
[01:00:10.898 --> 01:00:12.498]  Nice folks like Sting, meanwhile.
[01:00:12.498 --> 01:00:14.159]  I know folks that know him, he's a good guy.
[01:00:14.159 --> 01:00:24.905]  But you got somebody like Bono, Mono, who gives 99% of the money he raises for African charities to himself, and is proud of it, and then lectures everyone about global government and how we should open our borders up.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.941]  It's just sick, it's crazy.
[01:00:27.941 --> 01:00:32.204]  We're going to play later that song, The Truth About Alex Jones, from Michael Graves.
[01:00:32.204 --> 01:00:35.787]  Officialmichaelgraves.com for all the different bands and things he does.
[01:00:35.787 --> 01:00:41.992]  But just finishing up, gut level, you're a smart guy.
[01:00:41.992 --> 01:00:51.438]  Obviously, them trying to ban the Sex Pistols or trying to ban the Misfits in different venues made them bigger, not just that the music was good and raw and real.
[01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:55.163]  So, why do authoritarians keep saying this will work?
[01:00:55.163 --> 01:01:02.147]  I mean, I guess if you get total tyranny, like a Hitler, or a Stalin, or a Lenin, or a Mao, sometimes it works, and that's my concern.
[01:01:02.147 --> 01:01:16.115]  They think, with big tech and this combination with government, and Hollywood, that they can go all the way, but the only way they're going to succeed is to go all the way, and you read their white papers, they say they're going to go all the way, so I think people need to understand, this is do or die now.
[01:01:16.115 --> 01:01:20.338]  What's your gut level on where this is going?
[01:01:20.338 --> 01:01:20.858]  I believe
[01:01:22.023 --> 01:01:27.665]  That we are going to have to continue through the fire.
[01:01:27.665 --> 01:01:32.826]  I don't believe that the leftists are going to let up.
[01:01:32.826 --> 01:01:35.747]  They say that they're not going to let up.
[01:01:35.747 --> 01:01:39.888]  And again, we have to just be strong and courageous.
[01:01:40.683 --> 01:01:50.889]  And keep that attitude of victory and love and lifting each other up as we are and just the way that we've been doing.
[01:01:50.889 --> 01:01:56.393]  I'm in the game of, again, lifting people up.
[01:01:56.393 --> 01:02:02.897]  And one of the reasons that InfoWars is so important to me as an artist, because
[01:02:04.265 --> 01:02:07.466]  I as well am a great communicator.
[01:02:07.466 --> 01:02:19.290]  And in order to effectively communicate a cleaner, attuned vision, there's that synergy of mind, body and soul, Alex.
[01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:22.371]  And your organization has all of those things.
[01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:29.502]  Um, to, to, to through your products that, that I use on the road, I have my silver bullet.
[01:02:29.502 --> 01:02:37.647]  Um, I have my iodine, my super male vitality, like you, I'm working all the time from the, from the time I open up my eyes to the time I go to sleep, I have to be on stage.
[01:02:37.647 --> 01:02:39.509]  I perform at a very, very high level.
[01:02:39.509 --> 01:02:44.792]  Um, but that conveyance of emotion and spirit comes from the core of our humanity.
[01:02:45.612 --> 01:02:54.095]  Um, and your products that enhance our mind, body, I mean, I appreciate that, you know, they are great products, but you're in a lot better shape than I am.
[01:02:54.095 --> 01:02:56.636]  So, so, so that means a lot.
[01:02:56.636 --> 01:02:59.117]  What do you think is going to happen if they lose the midterms?
[01:02:59.117 --> 01:02:59.857]  Because you're right.
[01:02:59.857 --> 01:03:01.538]  They're getting more and more crazed.
[01:03:01.538 --> 01:03:03.158]  It's their religion.
[01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:07.660]  They're getting more and more violent than they say we're violent when we're not.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.541]  How do you think this ends?
[01:03:10.541 --> 01:03:13.722]  Well, I, I, I'm, I believe in, in,
[01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:19.297]  In what the Bible says, and so I believe that at the end of the day we're going to be victorious.
[01:03:19.297 --> 01:03:24.419]  If we lose the midterms, we're in big trouble, I think.
[01:03:24.419 --> 01:03:25.719]  We're in deep doo-doo.
[01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:26.120]  I agree.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:32.602]  Because the left are saying exactly what they want to do to us.
[01:03:32.602 --> 01:03:34.863]  Look what they're doing to us right now.
[01:03:34.863 --> 01:03:39.325]  It's not going to get any better if more of these people assume power.
[01:03:40.385 --> 01:03:49.142]  The struggle is right before us and it's clear as day and it's just going to get worse.
[01:03:49.142 --> 01:03:52.227]  God forbid the left wins the midterms.
[01:03:53.254 --> 01:03:55.356]  I agree, because they've said they're going into pure tyranny.
[01:03:55.356 --> 01:03:56.997]  They're going to roll it all up.
[01:03:56.997 --> 01:03:58.819]  Michael Graves, officialmichaelgraves.com.
[01:03:58.819 --> 01:04:01.701]  Join us in the next few weeks for a full hour if you're ever in Austin.
[01:04:01.701 --> 01:04:03.862]  I know you guys come to Austin sometimes.
[01:04:03.862 --> 01:04:07.886]  Please come in here, because we love the work you're doing, and I love your music already.
[01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:11.148]  So talking to you, I just wish I had known that you were a fan years ago.
[01:04:11.148 --> 01:04:12.529]  We've already had you on, a big fan of your work.
[01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:14.530]  So thank you for my family.
[01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:16.691]  Because I know you say, oh, you're just at a junior level doing this.
[01:04:16.691 --> 01:04:17.291]  No.
[01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:23.994]  Everybody standing up who's in the public eye and being persecuted, we're all equal when it comes to this on this continuum.
[01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:27.515]  And so for my children, my wife, my family, thank you for being a real man.
[01:04:27.515 --> 01:04:28.495]  And we really appreciate you.
[01:04:28.495 --> 01:04:29.876]  And I look forward to having you back on.
[01:04:30.771 --> 01:04:31.471]  Alex, thank you.
[01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:36.174]  God bless you, your family, your entire organization, everybody associated with you.
[01:04:36.174 --> 01:04:37.135]  Alex, thank you.
[01:04:37.135 --> 01:04:37.455]  Thank you.
[01:04:37.455 --> 01:04:38.095]  God bless.
[01:04:38.095 --> 01:04:38.996]  Guy's got a lot of spirit.
[01:04:38.996 --> 01:04:40.056]  You can hear it in the music.
[01:04:40.056 --> 01:04:42.358]  Alright, find out more at officialmichaelgraves.com.
[01:04:42.358 --> 01:04:48.941]  We're with infowars.com and newswars.com, the most banned transmission in the world, straight ahead with critical intel.
[01:04:48.941 --> 01:04:49.562]  Stay with us.
[01:04:49.562 --> 01:04:49.922]  We'll be back.
[01:04:58.243 --> 01:05:05.950]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:06.410]  It's you!
[01:05:07.526 --> 01:05:09.708]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:18.455]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:05:18.455 --> 01:05:23.019]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.481]  You are the info war.
[01:05:24.481 --> 01:05:28.004]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:05:28.664 --> 01:05:40.068]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:05:40.068 --> 01:05:48.031]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:55.074]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:55.074 --> 01:05:57.835]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:06:12.228 --> 01:06:37.745]  You know, when I hit a hole-in-one, I will tell you,
[01:06:41.243 --> 01:06:44.286]  But it's not really a hole-in-one because these people are so predictable.
[01:06:44.286 --> 01:06:46.548]  Criminals, sociopaths, psychopaths.
[01:06:46.548 --> 01:06:55.936]  That's why cops can literally, after years of following a psychopath, can figure out when they're going to strike, where, and really good detectives can actually have a hunch.
[01:06:55.936 --> 01:07:00.680]  It's not a hunch, it's their big subconscious brain going with their gut and then catching.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.782]  That's happened hundreds of times in the US.
[01:07:02.782 --> 01:07:03.603]  It happens in Europe.
[01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.065]  People literally learn how to get the mind of it.
[01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:06.605]  And I said,
[01:07:07.506 --> 01:07:09.687]  Last Tuesday, they're going to roll out more women.
[01:07:09.687 --> 01:07:12.608]  I'd say one on the weekend, probably Sunday night, about 7 o'clock.
[01:07:12.608 --> 01:07:13.368]  I play this yesterday.
[01:07:13.368 --> 01:07:19.451]  And then I said another day or two later, and then right before the vote, I said at least three.
[01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:20.751]  Well, it's now three.
[01:07:20.751 --> 01:07:24.413]  It's now gang raping.
[01:07:24.413 --> 01:07:28.554]  Meanwhile, all the other witnesses, now it's over 100 women have gone public saying, I knew Kevin.
[01:07:28.554 --> 01:07:29.475]  I dated him.
[01:07:29.475 --> 01:07:31.535]  He wouldn't even kiss.
[01:07:31.535 --> 01:07:33.856]  He was a total nerd.
[01:07:33.856 --> 01:07:35.337]  Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:07:37.461 --> 01:07:39.702]  You have almost no news coverage of the Pope.
[01:07:39.702 --> 01:07:45.226]  I meant to play this video yesterday, running out of a press conference because they kept bringing up sex with children.
[01:07:45.226 --> 01:07:50.029]  His deputy Pope is on a secret trial for over 100 trafficked little boys.
[01:07:50.029 --> 01:08:03.097]  You've got all these other cardinals busted, 3,000 priests, you know, unsealed indictments, you name it, just in Pennsylvania.
[01:08:03.097 --> 01:08:04.038]  This is getting insane.
[01:08:05.857 --> 01:08:15.484]  And meanwhile, the left, though, they hold up Bill Cosby, which, if you really look at that, folks, it's a setup because he was a conservative.
[01:08:15.484 --> 01:08:16.745]  He didn't play ball with the globalists.
[01:08:16.745 --> 01:08:17.526]  I'm not defending him.
[01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:18.626]  I'm not saying it's perfect.
[01:08:18.626 --> 01:08:27.433]  It's seedy, it's weird, but women go to a house, they take the drink, they take the pills, they go to a poker party at a hotel room with a bunch of dudes, and then they're playmates.
[01:08:27.433 --> 01:08:31.275]  I mean, you know what playmates are.
[01:08:31.275 --> 01:08:31.836]  They're hookers.
[01:08:34.261 --> 01:08:36.083]  I mean, that's a known fact.
[01:08:36.083 --> 01:08:38.745]  It's high-level hookers.
[01:08:38.745 --> 01:08:43.649]  And I'm saying, fine, send Bill Cosby to the electorate chair.
[01:08:43.649 --> 01:08:45.391]  Firing squad his ass.
[01:08:45.391 --> 01:08:45.791]  Seriously.
[01:08:49.127 --> 01:08:54.228]  But then let's get Bill Clinton in trouble for flying on the express with little kidnapped girls.
[01:08:54.228 --> 01:08:58.429]  Hillary supporting known convicted pedophiles and protecting them and everything else they've done.
[01:08:58.429 --> 01:09:04.391]  And the Vatican taken over by this vampiric cult that energetically sucks the energy off children.
[01:09:04.391 --> 01:09:05.291]  That's what it is.
[01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:09.252]  And I told you under Trump they start getting busted worldwide and they are!
[01:09:09.252 --> 01:09:11.893]  Arrest of pedophiles are up 15 plus fold!
[01:09:14.002 --> 01:09:27.451]  You'll see hundreds of arrests here, hundreds of arrests there, children caught in cages, dead bodies, and it just gets... The cops bust them, the witnesses bust them, Trump's green-lighted it, but the courts... it stops.
[01:09:27.451 --> 01:09:30.413]  So Leo Zegami joins us to get into this.
[01:09:30.413 --> 01:09:43.402]  He, of course, is from an aristocratic family, and he's friends with Berlusconi, and he first, five years before the current Jesuit Pope was in charge, said he'd be the Pope, said he would start announcing, we shouldn't have
[01:09:44.758 --> 01:09:50.943]  Pope's for life once they're elected, we should step down, which is now what they're saying.
[01:09:50.943 --> 01:09:56.768]  And so he's got, let me tell you, I've been to the Vatican with him, and he's got a lot of pull there with the patriots that are in there.
[01:09:56.768 --> 01:09:59.411]  There's not just evil there, there's some good people there as well.
[01:09:59.411 --> 01:10:01.573]  So Leo is the consummate insider.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.864]  And he has been in the Islamic Secret Societies, the Christian Secret Societies, the P2 Lodge.
[01:10:06.864 --> 01:10:08.025]  He's in all of it.
[01:10:08.025 --> 01:10:14.670]  In fact, when I was there, and I agreed not to get into any details, but he took me to some of the castles and facilities and things.
[01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:23.878]  In fact, he was going to take me to more, but I was exhausted because you're already seven hours back when you're from Texas, so it's the equivalent of
[01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:32.952]  You know, you're totally exhausted and then it's already midnight there and you're tromping around under a full moon in Rome going to castles, but Leo Zagami is with us right now.
[01:10:32.952 --> 01:10:35.252]  You can see all those interviews, but our YouTube channel's gone.
[01:10:35.252 --> 01:10:36.793]  We'll have to re-upload those.
[01:10:36.793 --> 01:10:38.133]  But Leo, what an incredible time.
[01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:42.975]  You know, for me, the way the left claims men and women having sex or men and women together is this dirty, bad thing.
[01:10:44.155 --> 01:10:46.597]  But then they want to now say babies aren't boys or girls at birth.
[01:10:46.597 --> 01:10:49.259]  They want to inflict them with mental illness from birth.
[01:10:49.259 --> 01:10:52.901]  They're targeting children because they can't fight off the pedophilia.
[01:10:52.901 --> 01:10:56.623]  They use the transsexualism as the cover for that, quote, educating the children.
[01:10:56.623 --> 01:10:59.585]  And then they look at Kavanaugh and they say, oh, but he's the devil.
[01:10:59.585 --> 01:11:01.607]  And they just escalate these charges.
[01:11:01.607 --> 01:11:03.808]  And then all the witnesses say none of it's true.
[01:11:03.808 --> 01:11:05.829]  What do you think's really going on here?
[01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:10.913]  And then I know you've got some big developments on the main high priestess of the Aleister Crowley movement.
[01:11:11.733 --> 01:11:17.197]  That's coming up next segment, who's in the John Podesta emails.
[01:11:17.197 --> 01:11:23.081]  She supposedly got assaulted, a pitcher smashed over her head by some activist.
[01:11:23.081 --> 01:11:25.143]  Was that a staged event?
[01:11:25.143 --> 01:11:29.726]  But again, this is the woman that supposedly is a vampire priestess.
[01:11:29.726 --> 01:11:32.708]  They all bragged, oh, she's like 80 years old, but she looks so young.
[01:11:32.708 --> 01:11:33.508]  Give me a break.
[01:11:33.508 --> 01:11:37.071]  Got a rubber chicken head like Joan Rivers did.
[01:11:37.071 --> 01:11:40.453]  So Leo Zagami of leozagami.com, bestselling author.
[01:11:40.453 --> 01:11:41.054]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:11:42.406 --> 01:11:44.869]  Hello Alex, it's great to be back on the show.
[01:11:44.869 --> 01:11:49.393]  Regarding Marina Abramović, apparently it was a genuine attack.
[01:11:49.393 --> 01:12:00.204]  I mean, she was shocked this canvas was broken on her head by this Eastern European artist who in the past has challenged other artists.
[01:12:00.204 --> 01:12:02.026]  Well, let's get to that next segment then.
[01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:05.169]  I was just throwing out possibilities and you're the expert in Europe.
[01:12:05.169 --> 01:12:05.949]  I defer to your...
[01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:09.672]  At this group of the moment, Alex, there is a really big one.
[01:12:09.672 --> 01:12:21.998]  The Pope has said himself, during a comment regarding John Paul II, that John Paul II is considered a saint, while he himself is a devil.
[01:12:21.998 --> 01:12:24.339]  He said, John Paul II was a saint.
[01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:24.920]  I am a devil.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.040]  Between brackets, what he said.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:33.323]  So, he actually admitted he's the devil and he did it when he was traveling Saturday to Lithuania.
[01:12:33.323 --> 01:12:35.783]  So, I mean... Wait, that's Associated Press.
[01:12:35.783 --> 01:12:36.444]  I forgot.
[01:12:36.444 --> 01:12:37.424]  That's the headline.
[01:12:37.424 --> 01:12:39.965]  Quote, Trump admits... Trump.
[01:12:39.965 --> 01:12:41.945]  Pope admits that he's the devil.
[01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:43.446]  So, there's your quote.
[01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:44.946]  Let's put that up for people.
[01:12:44.946 --> 01:12:46.067]  In fact, we should have started with this.
[01:12:46.067 --> 01:12:48.507]  We'll get to the Alistair Crowley praises in a minute.
[01:12:48.507 --> 01:12:49.888]  Leo Zegami, please start over.
[01:12:51.471 --> 01:13:05.300]  So, as I said, while he was travelling to Lithuania, he was presented with this book, I think, on John Paul II, and during the conversation with the journalist, he said basically that John Paul II was a saint and he was, he said, a devil.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:09.983]  So, I mean, he himself has admitted that he's really something totally different from John Paul II.
[01:13:10.903 --> 01:13:25.438]  And his deal with the Chinese is gathering more and more controversy, because the ex-Merit Bishop of Hong Kong, Bishop Zen, has heavily criticized this agreement.
[01:13:25.438 --> 01:13:33.907]  Basically, what Pope Francis has done in China, he has given his underground church to the Chinese authorities, who have already nominated their own bishops.
[01:13:34.716 --> 01:13:42.523]  And that means, basically, it's like bringing people to a concentration camp.
[01:13:42.523 --> 01:13:45.266]  And let me stop you, because you're so on target.
[01:13:45.266 --> 01:13:47.668]  The Pope has declared himself eye on the devil.
[01:13:47.668 --> 01:13:49.089]  Revelation is now being fulfilled.
[01:13:49.089 --> 01:13:49.990]  We'll pull the verses up.
[01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:58.013]  They have ordered via the Jesuits, the Chinese, to give all the names of underground Catholics so they can be arrested and killed.
[01:13:58.013 --> 01:13:59.493]  This is in the news!
[01:13:59.493 --> 01:14:11.136]  He is literally turning over the faithful in a 500, 600-year-old, ancient, secret Catholic organizations, which helped go into Japan when it was the death penalty.
[01:14:11.136 --> 01:14:14.657]  They are literally turning over the saints in China.
[01:14:14.657 --> 01:14:16.458]  He, the man, is the devil!
[01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:17.158]  My God!
[01:14:19.008 --> 01:14:42.212]  Well, it seems he is, and now he's been caught in a giant lie by a group of witnesses who have denounced these pedophile activities in Buenos Aires, and there is a documentary that was published on the 13th of September by LifeSite News, I think, and basically these witnesses are denouncing Pope Francis and they're saying
[01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:43.093]  That's right.
[01:14:56.857 --> 01:15:01.579]  These victims are bringing forward their testimonies.
[01:15:01.579 --> 01:15:08.523]  We're going to talk about that, but the big bombshell here is, why would he, we come back, get into the context.
[01:15:08.523 --> 01:15:10.804]  We have the Associated Press, but you're there in Rome.
[01:15:10.804 --> 01:15:13.185]  Why would he announce to people, I am the devil?
[01:15:13.185 --> 01:15:18.088]  I mean, when you declare yourself Lucifer, this is very religious.
[01:15:18.088 --> 01:15:20.209]  This is a special moment here, isn't it?
[01:15:21.716 --> 01:15:25.238]  Absolutely, and we couldn't expect something different from a Jesuit.
[01:15:25.238 --> 01:15:35.182]  I mean, from an order that for the first time places their own priest as the Pope, and now he declares himself the devil.
[01:15:35.182 --> 01:15:48.689]  This is a revelation, of course, of things to come, and I had already written about it in my book, as you know, Pope Francis... Let's talk about it, because in lesser magic, it is a declaration of blasphemy.
[01:15:48.689 --> 01:15:51.250]  I mean, as the Pope's saying, I am the devil.
[01:15:52.355 --> 01:15:53.718]  This is unbelievable!
[01:15:53.718 --> 01:15:55.041]  What does this herald?
[01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:56.163]  Straight ahead with Leo Zegani.
[01:15:57.699 --> 01:16:03.142]  When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers and identity thieves can see anything you do online.

[01:17:26.981 --> 01:17:29.142]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[01:17:29.142 --> 01:17:29.922]  Not true.
[01:17:29.922 --> 01:17:31.782]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[01:17:31.782 --> 01:17:35.783]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[01:17:35.783 --> 01:17:36.884]  Introducing Protovite.
[01:17:36.884 --> 01:17:43.225]  Proprietary liquid system that allows premium quality nutrients to positively affect the blood in an astonishing 5 minutes.

[01:17:51.988 --> 01:17:53.368]  Protovite is nutrition that gets in.
[01:17:59.255 --> 01:18:02.236]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[01:18:02.236 --> 01:18:04.837]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[01:18:04.837 --> 01:18:05.718]  No one else has this.
[01:18:05.718 --> 01:18:08.779]  From deep earth, crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:18:08.779 --> 01:18:10.240]  It's very hard for me to get.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.100]  It's the good halogen.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.261]  But instead, they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[01:18:14.261 --> 01:18:20.804]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[01:18:20.804 --> 01:18:23.405]  Bio-Truth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[01:18:23.405 --> 01:18:24.826]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[01:18:26.126 --> 01:18:31.829]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[01:18:31.829 --> 01:18:33.630]  So these go incredibly well together.
[01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:35.211]  We have a combo of those.
[01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.591]  Just experience it for yourself.
[01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:39.312]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[01:18:39.312 --> 01:18:40.353]  Very simple stuff.
[01:18:40.353 --> 01:18:41.974]  Filter your water.
[01:18:41.974 --> 01:18:43.975]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[01:18:43.975 --> 01:18:45.655]  Best out there for the price.
[01:18:45.655 --> 01:18:46.596]  When I say it's the last run,
[01:18:48.084 --> 01:18:50.867]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:12.222]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:19:12.222 --> 01:19:14.203]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:19:14.203 --> 01:19:17.664]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:19:17.664 --> 01:19:20.265]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:19:20.265 --> 01:19:22.566]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:19:22.566 --> 01:19:29.509]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:19:30.049 --> 01:19:39.857]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:19:39.857 --> 01:19:41.038]  We'll win.
[01:19:41.038 --> 01:19:43.360]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:51.106]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:19:51.106 --> 01:19:54.789]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:56.351]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[01:19:56.351 --> 01:19:57.031]  We need your support.
[01:19:57.031 --> 01:19:57.772]  I'm counting on you.
[01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:13.748]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.748 --> 01:20:24.155]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:20:24.155 --> 01:20:26.097]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:26.097 --> 01:20:30.180]  So we've got the Pope declaring himself the devil.
[01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:39.908]  In public, we've got giant pedophile rings run by the globalists that are taking over the Vatican, and the Catholic Church getting caught everywhere.
[01:20:39.908 --> 01:20:46.110]  We've got pedophilia coming out of the closet and left this publication saying, your children belong to us.
[01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:55.631]  Hospitals saying we won't call kids boys or girls, we're gonna totally brainwash them and mess them up, because that's really what the devil wants control of sex for, is to end procreation.
[01:20:55.631 --> 01:20:58.432]  And then you've got Leo Zagami, Vatican expert,
[01:20:59.585 --> 01:20:59.645]  to
[01:21:16.882 --> 01:21:19.044]  The Democratic Party by John Podesta.
[01:21:19.044 --> 01:21:23.549]  She's in the WikiLeaks getting a painting smashed over her head in Europe.
[01:21:23.549 --> 01:21:29.674]  Leo Zegami, take it away, wherever you want to start again, because this is all just wild what's going on.
[01:21:29.674 --> 01:21:34.399]  The corrupt coup in the Catholic Church, I think it's close to being undone, or is that a wrong statement?
[01:21:36.653 --> 01:21:45.643]  Well, they are having difficulties now in finding a replacement for Cardinal McCarrick, because first it was supposed to be Bohr, then Kupiec.
[01:21:45.643 --> 01:21:50.008]  Basically, all these Cardinals have skeletons in the closet.
[01:21:50.008 --> 01:21:58.017]  So the US Catholic Church at the moment doesn't have a real leader, because most of them were nominated by Pope Francis.
[01:21:58.457 --> 01:22:10.962]  And they were pedophiles, or they were covering up pedophilia, but they were bringing huge amounts of money in the Vatican, and for this reason the Pope closed an eye, like he always has.
[01:22:10.962 --> 01:22:18.025]  At the same time, we have, of course, this link with the Democratic Party in America as well as in Europe.
[01:22:18.485 --> 01:22:35.782]  And there is figures like Marina Abramovich that last month in Italy participated to a controversy regarding the immigrants and said that she even made this poster where she said that we are all in the same boat.
[01:22:35.782 --> 01:22:38.705]  And now she was attacked in Florence.
[01:22:39.085 --> 01:22:41.466]  And Florence is an occult city.
[01:22:41.466 --> 01:22:46.028]  Florence is a city with a real tradition of black magic.
[01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:47.689]  We have the monster of Florence.
[01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:50.030]  Of course, everybody knows about that.
[01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:55.392]  But of course, there is also other links to Satanism in Florence.
[01:22:55.392 --> 01:22:57.973]  And suddenly, in Florence, we have this attack
[01:22:58.433 --> 01:22:59.574]  We're good to go.
[01:23:14.864 --> 01:23:29.842]  Let's say he's fired Axe in some way against these... And I saw as it accurate as I read the papers that he said you're bringing a satanic ritual to this city trying to bring in basically the devil in the end of days that's why I'm opposing you and he's a well-known provocateur.
[01:23:31.175 --> 01:23:38.220]  He's an agent provocateur, of course, of art, but we know that Marina Bramovic is much more than an artist.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.782]  She's the high priestess of occultism.
[01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:44.225]  She started days back in the ex-Yugoslavia.
[01:23:44.225 --> 01:23:51.891]  We'll start with that, because literally in the WikiLeaks, but also George Soros, his son, they worship her.
[01:23:51.891 --> 01:23:54.293]  She's into Alison Crowley magic.
[01:23:55.053 --> 01:23:57.756]  They think she's like a vampire and is younger than she is?
[01:23:57.756 --> 01:23:59.517]  I think she looks like a sack of crap.
[01:23:59.517 --> 01:24:01.979]  Looks like a big disgusting maggot.
[01:24:01.979 --> 01:24:06.263]  Anyway, I can't even look at her.
[01:24:06.263 --> 01:24:08.064]  But why do they worship this pustule?
[01:24:10.322 --> 01:24:20.976]  Well, she comes from a sort of aristocratic, occult background that was also linked to the Soviet Union.
[01:24:20.976 --> 01:24:24.761]  At the time, she was a very privileged person in Yugoslavia.
[01:24:25.302 --> 01:24:50.358]  And from a very early age, she started to get involved with occultism, and she also embraced the philosophy of Aleister Crowley through a guy called Michael Berthiaux, who is based in Chicago, and he's a homosexual, at the same time he's a bishop, self-declared homosexual, but he runs this homosexual secret society called the Coranzon Club.
[01:24:50.678 --> 01:25:17.634]  So, and at the same time, he runs also another secret society that had a branch in Yugoslavia that, of course, Marina Abramović started to participate to meetings and, of course, she discovered Alistair Crowley's philosophy, but also she discovered Michael Berthiault's approach to modern art, using modern art and performance art to promote Satanism.
[01:25:17.634 --> 01:25:20.076]  So, what this guy is actually
[01:25:20.376 --> 01:25:22.998]  Well, that's why in her Reddit Ask Me Anything, she said,
[01:25:43.035 --> 01:25:46.158]  I don't think she's even near the top, but she's their probe.
[01:25:46.158 --> 01:25:48.961]  She's their coming out individual.
[01:25:48.961 --> 01:25:57.429]  And you know, I talked to Stanley Kubrick's daughter, and it was all off record, so I can't get into the details, but all hell broke loose after I interviewed her for two days.
[01:25:57.429 --> 01:25:58.770]  And we should re-upload those interviews.
[01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:02.794]  YouTube took them down, but he was never part of the occult, but it was everywhere.
[01:26:02.794 --> 01:26:05.497]  And it basically confirmed a lot of things we already knew, Leo.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:23.425]  Well, the strange thing is that even, I mean, after this accident, the mayor of Florence, of course, from the Democratic Party, of course, a close friend of the Clintons, the mayor of Florence apologized, said, oh, we are with you, Marina, sorry for this.
[01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:26.188]  I mean, she's just an artist.
[01:26:26.188 --> 01:26:27.870]  She has broken a canvas on her head.
[01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:29.211]  Don't make a big deal out of it.
[01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:36.740]  Instead, of course, the Mayor of Florence had to endorse and give his support because she is definitely an idol of the left wing.
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:42.666]  And she's politicizing her art, not only using it for occult means.
[01:26:42.666 --> 01:26:44.388]  And this is becoming more and more evident.
[01:26:45.345 --> 01:26:56.270]  We come back with one of the leading experts in the Vatican and the world and I knew who he was 15 years ago and read some of his books and thought when it all came true and when I met him in Rome he's just amazing.
[01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:59.712]  We'll come back with Leo Zagami on the other side.
[01:26:59.712 --> 01:27:04.875]  Get Rivanovic off the screen, I can't look at her anymore, that mental illness, that demon creature.
[01:27:04.875 --> 01:27:07.336]  Before we go any further, remember
[01:27:08.254 --> 01:27:12.355]  We're doing a special 16-hour broadcast today, right through midnight tonight.
[01:27:12.355 --> 01:27:12.875]  I'll be here.
[01:27:12.875 --> 01:27:14.176]  A bunch of big guests tonight.
[01:27:14.176 --> 01:27:16.256]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:27:16.256 --> 01:27:21.678]  If you'll just email your friends and family and neighbors and co-workers and say, hey, this is the censored show.
[01:27:21.678 --> 01:27:23.738]  This is what they don't want you to hear.
[01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.139]  He's being demonized everywhere.
[01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:28.740]  Why don't you find out what's really being said and what's really
[01:27:30.038 --> 01:27:41.404]  Going on and I'm taking on the devil worshiping child molesters, and it's all been proven And that's why they hate our guts, and they're so close to defeat so anytime I get You know a little bit of apprehension here.
[01:27:41.404 --> 01:27:42.285]  I just think about the children
[01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:49.051]  And how these vampires are literally sucking their souls, and then I man up, just go to the next level.
[01:27:49.051 --> 01:27:50.431]  So, spread the links.
[01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:52.732]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:27:52.732 --> 01:27:57.114]  They banned us on the apps, except for the Android app, and they'll probably ban that too, but you can download it.
[01:27:57.114 --> 01:27:58.474]  It'll still be on your phone.
[01:27:58.474 --> 01:28:00.575]  Infowars.com forward slash app, and then this.
[01:28:02.065 --> 01:28:07.229]  Whatever station you're listening to on radio or watching on TV or cable, tell people.
[01:28:07.229 --> 01:28:10.172]  There are a lot of stations have us on 24 hours a day.
[01:28:10.172 --> 01:28:10.772]  Get them out.
[01:28:10.772 --> 01:28:13.675]  We don't list all the stations because they then harass them.
[01:28:13.675 --> 01:28:16.577]  So you got to look in your area, find out, and then spread the word.
[01:28:16.577 --> 01:28:20.480]  We're getting a lot of big affiliates and it's neck and neck.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.162]  Every time the enemy does something, it's like Newtonian physics.
[01:28:23.162 --> 01:28:25.364]  God just matches it, you match it, but so it's just...
[01:28:26.605 --> 01:28:28.326]  It's just a free will thing.
[01:28:28.326 --> 01:28:31.547]  And so we're going to see where this convergence goes.
[01:28:31.547 --> 01:28:34.748]  But separately, you see this shirt?
[01:28:34.748 --> 01:28:36.708]  I just loved it back in the Trump campaign.
[01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:40.270]  Well, it's Trump with the severed head of the Gorgon Hillary.
[01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:41.150]  This is metaphysical.
[01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:41.590]  It's political.
[01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:42.650]  We don't want to cut her off for real.
[01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.291]  We already did politically.
[01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:48.272]  And it's just a great shirt to have with Infowars.com on the left shoulder.

[01:32:08.485 --> 01:32:10.547]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:10.547 --> 01:32:13.408]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.408 --> 01:32:14.909]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:14.909 --> 01:32:18.031]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:32:18.271 --> 01:32:21.714]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.714 --> 01:32:23.795]  It is a classical 360 win.

[01:32:33.523 --> 01:32:46.032]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:32:46.032 --> 01:32:47.253]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:13.913 --> 01:33:16.034]  Stand up and be counted!
[01:33:16.034 --> 01:33:31.168]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:33:31.168 --> 01:33:33.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:44.614 --> 01:33:47.136]  We are right in the middle of a special 16-hour broadcast.
[01:33:47.136 --> 01:33:48.817]  We're going right through midnight tonight.
[01:33:48.817 --> 01:33:51.299]  A bunch of special guests, comedians, you name it.
[01:33:51.299 --> 01:33:52.600]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:56.804]  And again, it's an act of rebellion to spread those links to InfoWars.com.
[01:33:56.804 --> 01:33:59.906]  So crank it up!
[01:33:59.906 --> 01:34:01.968]  Stand up and be counted, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:01.968 --> 01:34:04.690]  Decide which side you're on.
[01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:09.134]  And stop ceding your energy and your will to the globalists.
[01:34:10.177 --> 01:34:14.238]  Make the spiritual decision to stand against him and throw fear to the side.
[01:34:14.238 --> 01:34:23.060]  And then like the Red Sea, the waters part.
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:25.800]  Leo Zagami is our guest for another segment and I got a bunch of clips.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.061]  We've got Vox Day joining us and just a bunch of other things.
[01:34:29.061 --> 01:34:30.421]  I want to play this video.
[01:34:30.421 --> 01:34:35.442]  Vladimir Putin tests terrifying new anti-ship missiles by blowing up a fleet of warships in training exercise.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.122]  But I want to ask Leo Zagami, big pitcher here in a moment, but I didn't plug first hour, so I need to plug or we won't be here.
[01:34:43.122 --> 01:34:48.724]  You keep coming through, but I don't come through promoting the products.
[01:34:48.724 --> 01:34:50.745]  X2 is the best halogen.
[01:34:50.745 --> 01:34:53.425]  It's the purest iodine you can find on the market.
[01:34:53.425 --> 01:34:54.386]  It's in the palm oil.
[01:34:54.386 --> 01:34:54.986]  It's organic.
[01:34:54.986 --> 01:34:57.247]  We get it from oil companies that get it at 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[01:35:00.137 --> 01:35:03.598]  And it's part of the industrial sabotage we're under, that these companies always find out who we are.
[01:35:03.598 --> 01:35:05.119]  They try to jack up the prices and play games.
[01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:08.280]  And I just, I broke the contract, so that's it for X2.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.141]  It's amazing.
[01:35:09.141 --> 01:35:10.101]  I'm opening another company.
[01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:10.781]  We're working on it.
[01:35:10.781 --> 01:35:13.462]  Looks like we've got some ideas, but it's going to be a while till we get more in.
[01:35:13.462 --> 01:35:14.683]  It'll be under a new name.
[01:35:14.683 --> 01:35:17.304]  When you reformulate under the FDA rules, you've got to change the name.
[01:35:17.304 --> 01:35:20.105]  But this is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[01:35:20.105 --> 01:35:20.625]  Get it.
[01:35:20.625 --> 01:35:23.927]  Experience why so many people are deficient in it.
[01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:24.827]  4.9 star reviews.
[01:35:28.124 --> 01:35:29.987]  6,000 plus reviews.
[01:35:29.987 --> 01:35:30.027]  98%.
[01:35:30.027 --> 01:35:32.631]  Nobody else has got that on Power Reviews.
[01:35:32.631 --> 01:35:33.932]  The sale's still up there.
[01:35:33.932 --> 01:35:36.977]  Because I'm coming up with new specials in the next few days.
[01:35:36.977 --> 01:35:38.439]  I've just been too busy to even do that.
[01:35:38.439 --> 01:35:39.260]  Like I'm too busy to plug.
[01:35:40.066 --> 01:35:42.367]  So InfoWorksStore.com, we have some of the new specials.
[01:35:42.367 --> 01:35:44.228]  I just haven't got rid of this one yet.
[01:35:44.228 --> 01:35:45.629]  40% off the amazing Nootropic Brain Force.
[01:35:45.629 --> 01:35:47.669]  People love it, it's excellent.
[01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:49.950]  40% off Secret 12, highest quality organic B12.
[01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:54.132]  BuzzFeed tested it and said, oh, his is real clean and real good, but the best is this.
[01:35:54.132 --> 01:35:56.974]  Well, ours is the private label of what they said is the best in the country.
[01:35:56.974 --> 01:35:59.495]  What morons.
[01:35:59.495 --> 01:36:03.477]  Oh, and ours was $10 less than what Jeff Bezos sells.
[01:36:03.477 --> 01:36:06.398]  And why does Bezos have some supplements that are amongst the best?
[01:36:06.398 --> 01:36:08.559]  Because you want it to work so people reorder it.
[01:36:09.568 --> 01:36:11.029]  The point is, these are products you need.
[01:36:11.029 --> 01:36:15.652]  Air filtration, water filtration, non-zuma heirloom seeds, books, t-shirts, videos.
[01:36:15.652 --> 01:36:29.221]  I've got the new George Washington in his prime Indian War shirt that great patriots in a local military group designed and put together.
[01:36:29.221 --> 01:36:31.983]  It's got him with the tomahawk and the musket.
[01:36:31.983 --> 01:36:35.785]  So that's another bestseller, and these are limited editions at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:36:35.785 --> 01:36:38.948]  Okay, that said, go to LeoZagami.com and get his amazing books.
[01:36:38.948 --> 01:36:39.148]  Leo,
[01:36:39.869 --> 01:36:45.510]  You, six, seven years ago, whenever you were, I mean, I know it was five years before he got in.
[01:36:46.425 --> 01:36:52.550]  Wrote the book on Pope Francis and predicted it all and it's all come true and the pedophile rings and everything.
[01:36:52.550 --> 01:37:04.140]  So give us the next future over the horizon view with your great radar system about what you think is going to happen next, where the world is right now, how Trump ties in, who the different big players are.
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:10.425]  But just give us the basic boil down of this epic battle, who the bad guys are, who the good guys are and what you think is going to happen next.
[01:37:12.113 --> 01:37:18.596]  Well, this epic battle internal now to the Catholic Church has moved to the United States of America, as you know.
[01:37:18.596 --> 01:37:27.200]  A few days ago, a priest burned a rainbow flag outside the Chicago church in protest of Cardinal Blaise Kupiec.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.742]  And this guy is Reverend Paul Kalczyk.
[01:37:30.742 --> 01:37:37.365]  I hope I spell his name well, because he needs our support, because he's been now removed from his office four days ago.
[01:37:38.453 --> 01:37:48.207]  After he was leading with a few parishioners a prayer of exorcism over this rainbow flag that was used and found in a parish
[01:37:49.059 --> 01:37:55.704]  And apparently it wasn't just a normal rainbow flag, it had also symbols of the Catholic Church on it.
[01:37:55.704 --> 01:38:03.529]  So that's why Calcik led these parishioners in a period of exorcism for this flag.
[01:38:03.529 --> 01:38:09.593]  But of course, Cardinal Blaise Cupich, who is with Pope Francis, didn't like that.
[01:38:09.653 --> 01:38:20.183]  And by the way, there's no doubt that the LGBT, I don't hate any of those people for what they do, but when they go after children, it's LBGTP, and it's now a cover for pedophilia.
[01:38:20.183 --> 01:38:24.607]  The LGBT movement in the main, the big media, the big companies, are pro-pedophilia.
[01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:37.249]  Well, unfortunately, the Vatican seems to be pro-pedophilia because, as I said in past shows, there is a large percentage of their clergy that is homosexual.
[01:38:37.249 --> 01:38:44.735]  There is also a large percentage that is participating in acts of pedophilia, and the ones who are not participating in acts of pedophilia are covering up
[01:38:45.195 --> 01:38:57.285]  And we have our media covering it up, because it's in the police reports that five, six men are raping little eight-year-old boys, they're begging for mommy, they're pouring holly water on them, they're saying take the holy water, the semen in their mouth.
[01:38:57.285 --> 01:39:01.569]  I don't wanna get into details, but these are, for those that don't know, these are classic blasphemy rituals.
[01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:13.375]  This is a war that, of course, started when Donald J. Trump, and we announced it first here on InfoWars, started his war against the pedophilias worldwide.
[01:39:13.375 --> 01:39:14.236]  And how did you know that?
[01:39:14.236 --> 01:39:18.699]  Because about a year before he got elected, you came on and said, when Trump gets in, he'll declare war.
[01:39:18.699 --> 01:39:22.562]  And I knew he didn't like pedophiles and had said it on Twitter and things, but how did you know?
[01:39:24.588 --> 01:39:40.756]  Well, because, I mean, he is very close to Cardinal Burke and to all those conservatives and traditionalists that still exist within the Vatican that you also mentioned at the beginning of the show, those people who still believe that the Vatican can be saved in some way.
[01:39:40.756 --> 01:39:45.938]  So, Donald J. Trump is really, not against the Catholic Church, but against this
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:55.439]  This progressive Catholic Church that is being crafted... They're taking it over with their dogma of pedophilia.
[01:39:57.011 --> 01:40:04.133]  Yeah, that is crafted by the Jesuits and their liberal, progressive attitude, so of course he is against all that.
[01:40:04.133 --> 01:40:19.058]  And of course Pope Francis is the number one enemy of Donald J. Trump in the world, because him and Soros and the rest of the New World Order are trying in every way possible to censor people like us and at the same time fight Donald Trump.
[01:40:19.058 --> 01:40:21.538]  So this is the war that is happening at the moment.
[01:40:21.538 --> 01:40:26.580]  And we had a very important meeting last Saturday between Alexander Soros
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:27.461]  Thank you.
[01:40:42.177 --> 01:40:52.644]  And they're giving him this new organization, which basically is backed by Soros, to interface with all the candidates for the mid-term election.
[01:40:52.644 --> 01:40:55.046]  So they are forming a shadow government here.
[01:40:55.046 --> 01:40:59.068]  They are forming a shadow government, preparing for a coup.
[01:40:59.068 --> 01:41:06.953]  Well, I know George Soros is fading off like David Rockefeller into oblivion, but I'm told it's Alex Soros in the documents funding Antifa who particularly hates me.
[01:41:06.953 --> 01:41:10.596]  Why do you think Soros and Alexander Soros hate InfoWars so much?
[01:41:12.928 --> 01:41:20.676]  Because they are the ones who are pushing all this progressive liberal ideology.
[01:41:20.676 --> 01:41:25.582]  They are the main sponsors of the left-wing in Europe and in the United States of America.
[01:41:25.582 --> 01:41:28.845]  They, of course, are allies with China.
[01:41:28.845 --> 01:41:33.230]  They're basically pushing this left-wing ideology that in the end
[01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:33.890]  I think?
[01:41:52.253 --> 01:41:55.836]  We have been putting together a plan for these midterm elections.
[01:41:55.836 --> 01:42:04.143]  We need to understand what was said during this meeting because it's very important, I think, because I think that is anti-democratic.
[01:42:04.143 --> 01:42:21.077]  I think Alexander Soros shouldn't be allowed to do this in the United States of America, to meet with Obama and to do this kind of meetings in preparation for taking over the whole of the United States of America when they get out of the way Trump.
[01:42:21.257 --> 01:42:25.101]  Well, Leo, they admit that they've got a 25th Amendment martial law plan.
[01:42:25.101 --> 01:42:26.782]  Obama put Stay Behind Networks.
[01:42:26.782 --> 01:42:29.445]  I didn't know about the Alex Soros-Obama meeting.
[01:42:29.445 --> 01:42:30.986]  Tell us during the break where to find that.
[01:42:30.986 --> 01:42:32.848]  We're going to come back and ask you, because I agree.
[01:42:32.848 --> 01:42:37.252]  With 41 days left, they're making their move on America, on the Brexit, on everybody.
[01:42:37.252 --> 01:42:39.794]  What do we do to stop it straight ahead?
[01:42:39.794 --> 01:42:41.116]  They want us quieted down.
[01:42:41.116 --> 01:42:42.837]  They want Infowars shuttered.
[01:42:43.758 --> 01:42:48.244]  So we can't broadcast to the troops, as Paul Revere did, when they make their next move.
[01:42:48.244 --> 01:42:54.451]  What is the next big move from a man who really has, like nobody else, known what's going to happen, definitely with the Vatican.
[01:42:54.451 --> 01:42:55.553]  Leo Zagani, straight ahead.
[01:42:57.253 --> 01:43:03.636]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:03.636 --> 01:43:06.838]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:43:06.838 --> 01:43:10.560]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.262]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:15.262 --> 01:43:18.524]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:19.424 --> 01:43:30.410]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:30.410 --> 01:43:38.934]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:43:40.575 --> 01:43:49.626]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:44:55.605 --> 01:45:02.491]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:45:03.846 --> 01:45:12.529]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:45:12.529 --> 01:45:14.490]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:45:14.490 --> 01:45:17.951]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:45:17.951 --> 01:45:20.572]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:45:20.572 --> 01:45:22.873]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:45:22.873 --> 01:45:29.816]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:45:30.376 --> 01:45:40.160]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.340]  We'll win.
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:44.201]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[01:45:44.201 --> 01:45:51.404]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact you're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:45:51.404 --> 01:45:55.085]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[01:45:55.085 --> 01:45:56.645]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[01:45:56.645 --> 01:45:57.526]  We need your support.
[01:45:57.526 --> 01:45:58.066]  I'm counting on you.
[01:45:58.306 --> 01:46:02.450]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:09.516]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:46:09.516 --> 01:46:14.321]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.

[01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:04.471]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:38.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, as I said earlier in the interview, Leo Zegami is somebody who has broken hundreds of stories years before they come out.
[01:47:38.837 --> 01:47:41.358]  He lives in Rome, aristocratic family, dialed into everything.
[01:47:41.358 --> 01:47:45.721]  I met with him in Rome, worked with him, amazing contacts.
[01:47:45.721 --> 01:47:55.607]  And he has the exclusive that Alexander Soros, now taking the mantle over from his father, who reportedly is becoming senile, forms shadow government with Obama.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:59.861]  He's got the exclusive at leozagami.com.
[01:47:59.861 --> 01:48:04.162]  And again, this is in preparation to take out Trump.
[01:48:04.162 --> 01:48:05.622]  They're in total war mode.
[01:48:05.622 --> 01:48:07.503]  They admit they want 25th Amendment.
[01:48:07.503 --> 01:48:09.423]  They admit they're trying to remove him.
[01:48:09.423 --> 01:48:11.804]  They admit they're engaged in all this.
[01:48:11.804 --> 01:48:15.524]  And so he's saying he's got intel on what their moves are going to be.
[01:48:15.524 --> 01:48:18.985]  Leo Zagami, obviously this is critical information.
[01:48:18.985 --> 01:48:21.606]  People need to listen very, very, very carefully.
[01:48:24.147 --> 01:48:38.311]  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee has been shaped by the Soros as a new toy for the political relaunch of Obama and Michelle Obama, so the Obamas.
[01:48:38.311 --> 01:48:42.433]  This motto they have is also quite meaningful.
[01:48:42.433 --> 01:48:45.294]  The political system is rigged.
[01:48:45.294 --> 01:48:46.654]  They have rigged it.
[01:48:46.654 --> 01:48:47.994]  Of course it's rigged.
[01:48:47.994 --> 01:48:49.355]  But by them, not by us.
[01:48:49.995 --> 01:48:54.759]  Notice that, they're calling themselves the resistance.
[01:48:54.759 --> 01:49:02.804]  Everything we've said, they're now becoming that, then banning me to then step in as the body snatcher into the body.
[01:49:02.804 --> 01:49:08.568]  Yeah, in fact, I mean, even their motto is very similar to the work we have done in the past few years.
[01:49:08.568 --> 01:49:12.411]  When they say the political system is rigged, the fight to fix it is now.
[01:49:14.591 --> 01:49:16.072]  This is really ridiculous.
[01:49:16.072 --> 01:49:31.504]  I think that people should check out Alexander Soros as the new, really, puppet master of this new world order, because he's arriving from an experience as chairman, of course, of the Open Society.
[01:49:31.504 --> 01:49:38.209]  And he's been also indicated this year in the famous World Economic Forum
[01:49:38.929 --> 01:49:42.971]  As one of the young global leaders of 2018.
[01:49:42.971 --> 01:49:47.133]  So he's the upcoming figure that will replace George Soros.
[01:49:47.133 --> 01:49:51.835]  This means, basically, that we're never going to get rid of Soros.
[01:49:51.835 --> 01:49:54.456]  Father, son.
[01:49:54.456 --> 01:49:57.658]  This family is going to continue.
[01:49:58.467 --> 01:50:08.596]  pushing their New World Order and their democratic, progressive, liberal ways, and of course, in support of Pope Francis.
[01:50:08.596 --> 01:50:16.123]  And of course, with artists like Marina Abramovic, that promote this whole thing.
[01:50:16.123 --> 01:50:21.267]  So, they have the whole system rigged, but they accused us of having rigged it.
[01:50:21.267 --> 01:50:24.670]  I mean, it's quite... Why are they so scared now?
[01:50:26.071 --> 01:50:29.313]  They admit a lot of publications that globalism is in retreat, it's in trouble.
[01:50:29.313 --> 01:50:30.934]  Is that true in your view?
[01:50:30.934 --> 01:50:37.519]  Or, if this was a football game, or a soccer match, where are we right now against the devil worshippers?
[01:50:37.519 --> 01:50:44.403]  Well, just the words that were published on Twitter on the 22nd of September by Alexander Sorza buried a meaning.
[01:50:44.403 --> 01:50:55.070]  He says, it was great to welcome President Barack Obama back into my home this week and introduce him on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
[01:50:55.649 --> 01:50:57.274]  He says, my home.
[01:50:57.274 --> 01:50:58.177]  So what is his home?
[01:50:58.177 --> 01:50:59.080]  The Democratic Party?
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:02.531]  Is the Democratic Party the party of George Soros, Alexander Soros?
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:06.182]  Or is it the Party of the United States of America?
[01:51:06.182 --> 01:51:15.548]  So this is really revealing to the people, once and for all, who are the puppet masters here, who are pulling the strings.
[01:51:15.548 --> 01:51:26.234]  I mean, the photos of Alexander and Obama, the way they exit the room after the talk, it's like they're hand in hand together.
[01:51:26.234 --> 01:51:29.376]  Well, let's just say it, they act like they're gay lovers.
[01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:34.032]  Possibly, but in any case...
[01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:55.032]  Leaked documents show Obama was planning martial law in Maryland in 2015 is the headline.
[01:51:55.032 --> 01:51:58.053]  And it's all their own documents, how they fund Antifa, how they do it.
[01:51:58.053 --> 01:52:03.874]  Antifa is allowed to dox people, threaten to kill people, harass people in restaurants, Twitter won't take them down.
[01:52:03.874 --> 01:52:07.435]  I confront a CNN reporter who's having me censored, I get banned on Twitter.
[01:52:07.435 --> 01:52:11.276]  So it shows the power of Antifa because Alexander Soros funds it.
[01:52:13.004 --> 01:52:18.513]  And now they want to put their hands on actually on the redistricting, on the vote process.
[01:52:18.513 --> 01:52:21.417]  They want to change the law in their favor.
[01:52:21.417 --> 01:52:26.105]  They want to make sure that there is never another possibility for Donald Trump.
[01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:29.372]  So, this is the danger that we have here.
[01:52:29.372 --> 01:52:37.596]  That Soros is starting to move, you know, his various puppets so he can get this law changed.
[01:52:37.596 --> 01:52:45.341]  And once he has the law changed, he has Washington in his hands, Silicon Valley in his hands, then he has the whole world in his hands, basically.
[01:52:45.341 --> 01:52:52.225]  The whole world wide web and this planet with China, of course, and with the communists.
[01:52:52.225 --> 01:52:55.547]  This is the first time, Alex, that we have the Pope
[01:52:56.447 --> 01:53:03.311]  Nominating bishops together with a communist country having a say in the whole process.
[01:53:03.311 --> 01:53:09.394]  I mean Catholicism was about bishops being nominated by the Pope and the Vatican.
[01:53:09.394 --> 01:53:13.316]  Now they're nominated together with the Communist Party of China.
[01:53:13.965 --> 01:53:27.315]  Of course Catholics will rebel in the next few weeks and say, why don't we have the same opportunity in America, in Europe, of participating to the process of nominating our own bishops and cardinals.
[01:53:27.315 --> 01:53:29.417]  But this is only possible for the communists.
[01:53:29.417 --> 01:53:32.459]  Doesn't this tell you something, Alex, about where we're going?
[01:53:33.982 --> 01:53:44.969]  It is, and if people are watching on TV right now, there's the article from earlier this year, Documents to Tell Plan for Civil Unrest, Martial Law in Baltimore, run by Alexander Soros.
[01:53:44.969 --> 01:53:51.454]  Notice the two videos are banned, though, because YouTube took us down, but we're going to re-upload those videos and have them added to that page.
[01:53:51.454 --> 01:53:59.239]  It's a whole project we've got, trying to hire folks to be able to upload the thousands of videos, because this is show-damning, and all these videos are so evergreen.
[01:53:59.839 --> 01:54:03.042]  And like fine wine, they get better over time.
[01:54:03.042 --> 01:54:06.304]  Like real estate, they just appreciate.
[01:54:06.304 --> 01:54:10.328]  That's why they wanted the channel with billions of views taken down.
[01:54:10.328 --> 01:54:17.333]  And so, in closing, Leo Zagami of leozagami.com, are we winning?
[01:54:17.333 --> 01:54:19.054]  Are we losing?
[01:54:19.054 --> 01:54:20.055]  What do you expect to happen?
[01:54:20.055 --> 01:54:23.418]  What can the average person do to defeat this, really, the satanic world government?
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:37.143]  Well on the short run, technically speaking, we are losing because they are more powerful from Silicon Valley in getting their message through.
[01:54:37.143 --> 01:54:41.564]  They have already the mainstream media, now they are getting the internet on their side.
[01:54:41.564 --> 01:54:45.865]  So on the short run, they might actually win this war.
[01:54:45.865 --> 01:54:47.505]  But then on the long run, people
[01:54:47.805 --> 01:54:51.267]  I'm going to realize this is going to become a living hell.
[01:54:51.267 --> 01:55:07.618]  They started with InfoWars, they're going to continue with every single conservative journalist or blogger, and then in the end, if you don't think in the way they want, in that left-wing ideology, you're not going to be allowed to even talk.
[01:55:07.618 --> 01:55:15.823]  And that's why people like Faith Goldie and the Misfits frontman Michael Graves, everybody's getting more aggressive now.
[01:55:16.283 --> 01:55:17.683]  Yeah, she's number three in the debate.
[01:55:17.683 --> 01:55:18.284]  They don't have her.
[01:55:18.284 --> 01:55:19.764]  She goes on stage anyways.
[01:55:19.764 --> 01:55:24.185]  They're gonna find out that the big dog is about to get off the porch, Leo.
[01:55:24.185 --> 01:55:26.766]  Yeah, a few days ago, I was about to go.
[01:55:26.766 --> 01:55:29.466]  I don't want to say the name because I feel sorry for him.
[01:55:29.466 --> 01:55:37.448]  I was about to go on an important radio show in Canada, and they begged me to not nominate your name.
[01:55:37.448 --> 01:55:44.070]  I mean, they were like, if we put the name of Alex Jones through the system, they're gonna block everything.
[01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.590]  I was like,
[01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:47.711]  Petrified, in front of this.
[01:55:47.711 --> 01:55:55.134]  I mean, you are telling me, my friend Alex, I collaborated and worked with him for years, and you're telling me to not nominate his name?
[01:55:55.134 --> 01:55:57.234]  I mean, this is where we are at!
[01:55:57.234 --> 01:55:57.594]  Colleagues!
[01:55:57.594 --> 01:55:58.715]  Well, that's the litmus test.
[01:55:58.715 --> 01:56:01.716]  In fact, they tell talk show hosts, just put him down, we'll promote you.
[01:56:01.716 --> 01:56:03.076]  But then next it'll be them.
[01:56:03.076 --> 01:56:04.537]  It's so draconian.
[01:56:04.537 --> 01:56:06.198]  Well, Leo Zagami, what'd you tell the show?
[01:56:06.198 --> 01:56:06.878]  Sorry, not coming on?
[01:56:09.611 --> 01:56:13.994]  I was, in the end, I was just like shocked, Alex.
[01:56:13.994 --> 01:56:18.318]  I said, okay, whatever, you know, I couldn't be bothered, you know, with the whole thing.
[01:56:18.318 --> 01:56:23.361]  It's not, I mean, I was ready to go on the show with my Infos t-shirt on.
[01:56:23.361 --> 01:56:25.483]  So I was like really ready for it.
[01:56:26.164 --> 01:56:27.666]  It kind of was a turn off.
[01:56:27.666 --> 01:56:29.489]  It was a little bit when you go with a woman.
[01:56:29.489 --> 01:56:30.109]  No, I understand.
[01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:33.935]  Well, that's why we've all got to work harder because if they can bring us down, they can bring us all down.
[01:56:33.935 --> 01:56:35.396]  And I know they've tried to throw you in prison.
[01:56:35.396 --> 01:56:35.977]  You name it, Leo.
[01:56:35.977 --> 01:56:38.861]  You've been through this and they're in Rome and they're in Italy.
[01:56:38.861 --> 01:56:39.402]  God bless you.
[01:56:39.402 --> 01:56:40.283]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:56:40.283 --> 01:56:40.824]  Leo Zagami.
[01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:53.267]  Thank you very much, Alex, and you have all my support and the support of a lot of people here in Europe that are starting to really look at InfoWars as a beacon of light and freedom of speech.
[01:56:53.267 --> 01:56:54.388]  Well, we're trying the best we can.
[01:56:54.388 --> 01:56:55.149]  We've got a great crew.
[01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:56.011]  I appreciate you, Leo.
[01:56:57.162 --> 01:57:03.063]  We're gonna come back, start the next hour, I'm gonna open the phones up and get to a bunch of clips and news I haven't covered, but this is what it comes down to.
[01:57:03.063 --> 01:57:06.664]  They put up these psyops that if you have Alex Jones on YouTube, you'll be banned.
[01:57:06.664 --> 01:57:07.825]  It's not true.
[01:57:07.825 --> 01:57:10.905]  But they just say it, say it, say it, so it becomes true.
[01:57:10.905 --> 01:57:15.546]  Like, it's one thing to ban me off the platform, it's another thing to say, you can't talk about him.
[01:57:15.546 --> 01:57:17.267]  What, like I'm the new N-word?
[01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:27.376]  But again, they're seeing if you're stupid, and they're testing, and they're trying to rob your birthright right now, hoping you think, oh, it's just Alex Jones, I won't defend him.
[01:57:27.376 --> 01:57:28.476]  We need your financial support.
[01:57:28.476 --> 01:57:30.217]  We have great products you need.
[01:57:30.217 --> 01:57:33.960]  On top of that, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:37.842]  We've gotta end this special on X2, but I haven't taken it down 25%.
[01:57:37.842 --> 01:57:40.604]  It's still there, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:40.604 --> 01:57:41.885]  Box Day's coming up, too.
[01:57:41.885 --> 01:57:42.305]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.359 --> 01:57:55.742]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.742 --> 01:57:57.202]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.202 --> 01:58:01.903]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.903 --> 01:58:06.905]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:58:07.145 --> 01:58:27.305]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.805 --> 01:58:31.789]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[01:58:31.789 --> 01:58:35.473]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[01:58:35.473 --> 01:58:40.457]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:58:40.457 --> 01:58:43.200]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:44.601]  Supermail Vitality.
[01:58:44.601 --> 01:58:45.642]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:49.286 --> 01:58:52.269]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[01:58:52.269 --> 01:58:54.851]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[01:58:54.851 --> 01:58:55.732]  No one else has this.
[01:58:55.732 --> 01:58:58.794]  From deep earth, crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:58:58.794 --> 01:59:00.276]  It's very hard for me to get.
[01:59:00.276 --> 01:59:02.177]  It's the good halogens.
[01:59:02.177 --> 01:59:04.299]  But instead, they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[01:59:04.299 --> 01:59:10.845]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[01:59:10.845 --> 01:59:13.447]  Bio-Truth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[01:59:13.447 --> 01:59:14.868]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[01:59:16.169 --> 01:59:21.872]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[01:59:21.872 --> 01:59:23.653]  So these go incredibly well together.
[01:59:23.653 --> 01:59:25.233]  We have a combo of those.
[01:59:25.233 --> 01:59:26.614]  Just experience it for yourself.
[01:59:26.614 --> 01:59:29.335]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[01:59:29.335 --> 01:59:30.376]  Very simple stuff.
[01:59:30.376 --> 01:59:32.017]  Filter your water.
[01:59:32.017 --> 01:59:34.098]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[01:59:34.098 --> 01:59:35.558]  Best out there for the price.
[01:59:35.558 --> 01:59:36.639]  When I say it's the last run,
[01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:39.431]  I think it'll be six months a year until we get more.
[01:59:39.431 --> 01:59:40.251]  I hope we get more.
[01:59:40.251 --> 01:59:41.592]  This is the last run, it looks like.
[01:59:41.592 --> 01:59:42.452]  Survival Short Exit 2.
[01:59:42.452 --> 01:59:51.337]  InfoWarsTour.com or InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:51.337 --> 02:00:00.401]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:00.401 --> 02:00:05.684]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.358 --> 02:00:23.542]  There's a story up on Europe Wars.
[02:00:23.542 --> 02:00:27.204]  That's Europe.infowars.com.
[02:00:27.204 --> 02:00:31.127]  Armed Klan turns German club into war zone.
[02:00:31.127 --> 02:00:32.928]  And the police are trying to cover up that it's Islamic.
[02:00:32.928 --> 02:00:34.449]  They later admit it is.
[02:00:34.449 --> 02:00:35.670]  This is happening everywhere.
[02:00:37.875 --> 02:00:38.995]  So this is the tribalism.
[02:00:38.995 --> 02:00:46.918]  We bring in giant third-world populations from very clan-based, gang-based systems and then think that this isn't going to happen.
[02:00:46.918 --> 02:00:48.039]  So that's coming up.
[02:00:48.039 --> 02:00:50.159]  Vox Day is riding shotgun with us for the hour.
[02:00:50.159 --> 02:00:57.542]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to open the phones up specifically for any questions or comments you have for him or I on what's happening in the world today.
[02:00:57.542 --> 02:01:01.383]  But just since he was on with us a month ago, I've been banned on PayPal.
[02:01:01.383 --> 02:01:02.824]  That happens in like seven workdays.
[02:01:04.941 --> 02:01:06.922]  They're going at us in a bunch of ways behind the scenes.
[02:01:06.922 --> 02:01:08.742]  They are really craved.
[02:01:08.742 --> 02:01:13.063]  And I know they've banned and attacked Vox as well.
[02:01:13.063 --> 02:01:14.983]  Again, we don't need to really get into his bio.
[02:01:14.983 --> 02:01:15.963]  Everybody knows Vox Day.
[02:01:15.963 --> 02:01:17.063]  Vox Day is a best-selling author.
[02:01:17.063 --> 02:01:19.884]  Well, SJW is always lying.
[02:01:19.884 --> 02:01:21.404]  SJW has always doubled down.
[02:01:21.404 --> 02:01:25.445]  He's the lead editor of the comic system he's launched.
[02:01:25.445 --> 02:01:26.125]  It's very successful.
[02:01:26.125 --> 02:01:28.026]  We sell the comics at ForrestWarren.com.
[02:01:28.026 --> 02:01:29.706]  He's also a game and technology designer.
[02:01:30.726 --> 02:01:39.988]  He's the creator of Infogalactica, the SJW free alternative to Wikipedia, voxday.blogspot.com, or voxuniversity, voxversity.com.
[02:01:39.988 --> 02:01:40.988]  This is a short segment.
[02:01:40.988 --> 02:01:44.689]  Some stations don't carry it, but I want to get you started here.
[02:01:44.689 --> 02:01:55.952]  What is front and center for you, Vox, with all the craziness going on in Kavanaugh and 41 Days Out and the harassment of conservatives everywhere on the left really forming into a fascistic group?
[02:01:55.952 --> 02:01:57.812]  How would you describe the current climate right now?
[02:02:00.071 --> 02:02:12.076]  Well, I think that whoever said that everything that is happening across the West is prelude for civil war is a pretty good way of describing it.
[02:02:12.076 --> 02:02:15.277]  And who are the main players?
[02:02:15.277 --> 02:02:24.461]  Well, the dividing lines are predominantly globalist versus nationalist, but there's a lot of subdivisions within that.
[02:02:24.461 --> 02:02:28.443]  You know, right now there is a de facto alliance of
[02:02:29.398 --> 02:02:40.011]  The various identity groups that are making up the Democratic Party, plus a shrinking subset of the white American population.
[02:02:40.011 --> 02:02:46.699]  And then on the Republican side, you've got the it's divided because you've got the Trump faction, which is essentially.
[02:02:49.119 --> 02:03:03.592]  Civic nationalist and predominantly white, but then you've also got the small group of actual nationalists, and then you've got the group of people who are sort of big business globalists, but are still otherwise on the Republican side.
[02:03:03.592 --> 02:03:13.822]  So it's all a mess right now, and it's going to continue to get worse because all of the trends are simply pointing to more conflict.
[02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:23.535]  I agree, that's why Trump's desperately trying to launch a stability project to not have this global meltdown.
[02:03:23.535 --> 02:03:42.888]  Well, there's no question, but as great as the God Emperor is, and he is the best president that we've had across the 20th century and into the 21st century, no question, I don't know that his civic nationalism
[02:03:43.758 --> 02:04:00.183]  Is up to understanding the magnitude of the task, you know, a lot of us who were steeped in the civic nationalist concept of the United States find it really, really hard to accept the reality that.
[02:04:03.268 --> 02:04:05.730]  It's not a viable plan.
[02:04:05.730 --> 02:04:15.016]  Assimilation is not a viable plan when you've got 65 million people who have entered, when you've got 40-some million people who don't speak English at home.
[02:04:15.016 --> 02:04:21.060]  And they've been weaponized to make sure it didn't work.
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:23.342]  Oh, no question.
[02:04:23.342 --> 02:04:31.708]  There is a number of interested parties, both inside the United States and without,
[02:04:32.845 --> 02:04:39.187]  And, you know, before somebody leaps in and thinks that I'm just talking about Israel or something, I'm not.
[02:04:39.187 --> 02:04:45.709]  I'm specifically talking about a number of other countries and global rivals.
[02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:48.249]  And that's bound to happen.
[02:04:48.249 --> 02:04:53.491]  Well, we should talk about the big pieces from 35,000 feet and zoom in with Vox Day straight ahead.
[02:04:56.348 --> 02:05:03.815]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[02:05:03.815 --> 02:05:13.083]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure Krill Oil concentrate.
[02:05:13.083 --> 02:05:22.151]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as Acetazanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[02:05:23.090 --> 02:05:34.533]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[02:05:34.533 --> 02:05:43.696]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[02:05:44.096 --> 02:05:46.818]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[02:05:46.818 --> 02:05:50.481]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:05:50.481 --> 02:05:52.642]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:48.907 --> 02:06:54.314]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:54.314 --> 02:06:56.136]  Move, bitch!
[02:06:56.136 --> 02:06:59.200]  Get out the way!
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:03.225]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is ours!
[02:07:03.766 --> 02:07:05.587]  This is the American flag!
[02:07:05.587 --> 02:07:09.409]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[02:07:09.409 --> 02:07:12.950]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:14.171]  I will not let you down.
[02:07:14.171 --> 02:07:17.172]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:07:17.172 --> 02:07:19.213]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[02:07:19.213 --> 02:07:21.414]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[02:07:21.414 --> 02:07:26.937]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[02:07:26.937 --> 02:07:29.658]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:07:29.658 --> 02:07:30.659]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:07:32.702 --> 02:07:48.787]  So I'm going to ask Vox Dei, who's a smart guy, video game creator, patriot, comic book pioneer, you name it, voxversity.com, why InfoWars is under particular attack and why they're genuinely obsessed with it.
[02:07:48.787 --> 02:07:52.628]  Because I can get, I'm an easy target, taking stuff out of context, and I thought that was it for a while.
[02:07:52.628 --> 02:07:59.270]  But now, I've talked to people involved in the government and the enemy side some, and they are literally obsessed with InfoWars.
[02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:02.091]  And I think it's because they see it as the spirit of Americana.
[02:08:03.379 --> 02:08:12.362]  And they're threatened by the whole pantheon of guests we have on, and they somehow believe if they can shut us down, that that will be the blueprint for shutting everybody else down.
[02:08:12.362 --> 02:08:25.727]  And then, Vox, I want you to get more into the 35,000-foot view of the globalists and what they want, what makes them tick, so people understand why they go out of their way for power and control, and why they target innocence.
[02:08:25.727 --> 02:08:29.028]  And can civilization be saved?
[02:08:29.028 --> 02:08:29.708]  Because it's true.
[02:08:30.751 --> 02:08:35.573]  The paradox is prosperity makes monsters, adversity makes men.
[02:08:35.573 --> 02:08:41.795]  Liberty has created so much freedom and so much wealth that the average person is becoming more decadent and slob-like.
[02:08:41.795 --> 02:08:45.597]  But just like there's a Newtonian physics for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:08:46.337 --> 02:08:50.259]  We're giving the choice with Trump and nationalism and all the things that are happening.
[02:08:50.259 --> 02:09:05.567]  We're just as powerful as the evil, in fact even more so, but people are seeing kind of the ghost side of what the globalists are doing, this projection of resistance, but it only becomes real if we step into it and make it the future.
[02:09:05.567 --> 02:09:08.309]  We can't just see the paradoxical
[02:09:09.889 --> 02:09:14.733]  Doppelganger of the New World Order and think, oh look, we're winning because it's there.
[02:09:14.733 --> 02:09:18.155]  We have to push it like a sailing ship has to have wind in the sails.
[02:09:18.155 --> 02:09:21.157]  Does that make sense?
[02:09:21.157 --> 02:09:23.679]  I think it made elements of sense.
[02:09:23.679 --> 02:09:24.119]  Yes.
[02:09:24.119 --> 02:09:28.302]  It's a large gestalt, but just go from that about how do we beat these people?
[02:09:28.302 --> 02:09:31.444]  Can we have a real victory?
[02:09:31.444 --> 02:09:34.026]  Or is it just a stopgap measure with Trump's, what I'm getting at?
[02:09:34.026 --> 02:09:35.807]  And then why is Infowars under such attack?
[02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:39.857]  Well, let me start with the second question first.
[02:09:39.857 --> 02:09:54.085]  The reason that InfoWars is under attack is that InfoWars and you, Alex, are two of the biggest challenges to the narrative that they are attempting to push.
[02:09:54.085 --> 02:10:02.230]  And so they can't stand any challenge to the narrative because their narrative is false and they know it.
[02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:04.591]  And so when they are
[02:10:06.776 --> 02:10:13.438]  Looking out at who is opposing them, what they see is they are shocked.
[02:10:13.438 --> 02:10:19.701]  They are astounded and they find it impossible to believe the number of listeners you have.
[02:10:19.701 --> 02:10:25.783]  They, remember, they were surprised that Donald Trump got enough votes to beat Hillary.
[02:10:25.783 --> 02:10:29.484]  They don't have a accurate understanding
[02:10:30.263 --> 02:10:35.108]  Of the divisions within the country, they think that they're much more powerful than they are.
[02:10:35.108 --> 02:10:37.830]  They think they're much more popular than they are.
[02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:42.234]  And so InfoWars challenges that directly.
[02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:53.645]  Because when they look at the fact that, you know, only 2 million people watch their cable news television show, or only 5000 people follow them on Twitter.
[02:10:54.545 --> 02:11:10.411]  The fact that you have a large following on Twitter, the fact that you have a lot of YouTube subscribers or whatever, they find that personally offensive because that reminds them that they are considerably less influential than they believe themselves to be.
[02:11:10.411 --> 02:11:13.973]  And all their ratings keep going down, down, down, down, down.
[02:11:13.973 --> 02:11:16.554]  Are they ever going to give up or are they just going to become more insane?
[02:11:18.379 --> 02:11:20.439]  They will always become more insane.
[02:11:20.439 --> 02:11:27.721]  They're not going to give up because I address this actually in my book, SJWs always double down.
[02:11:27.721 --> 02:11:33.523]  And they're driven by a sense of inferiority.
[02:11:33.523 --> 02:11:36.863]  And they're driven by a sense of self-loathing.
[02:11:36.863 --> 02:11:42.245]  And this causes them to need an external opponent.
[02:11:42.245 --> 02:11:44.785]  You know, you feel a need for them.
[02:11:44.785 --> 02:11:47.986]  I mean, I know it sounds funny, but to a certain extent,
[02:11:48.735 --> 02:11:50.616]  You complete them.
[02:11:50.616 --> 02:11:54.257]  And so, without you, they don't have a mission.
[02:11:54.257 --> 02:11:57.659]  Without you, they don't have a jihad.
[02:11:57.659 --> 02:12:07.923]  And so, you know, these social justice warriors are focused on eliminating the threat to the narrative that you represent.
[02:12:09.346 --> 02:12:11.087]  I think that's beautifully said.
[02:12:11.087 --> 02:12:14.409]  And so they've chosen Infowars as the archetype to be destroyed.
[02:12:14.409 --> 02:12:16.591]  And that was a selfish question, but I agree with you.
[02:12:16.591 --> 02:12:17.692]  That's what they're doing.
[02:12:17.692 --> 02:12:20.033]  Meanwhile, we already did our damage years ago.
[02:12:20.033 --> 02:12:21.434]  Everything else is gravy.
[02:12:21.434 --> 02:12:28.679]  I don't think they even understand the young people being brainwashed in the public schools are totally... That's what you've done with your comic books.
[02:12:28.679 --> 02:12:29.639]  They're already bestsellers.
[02:12:29.639 --> 02:12:32.281]  They're rebelling, aren't they?
[02:12:32.281 --> 02:12:33.962]  Oh, there's no question.
[02:12:33.962 --> 02:12:34.583]  It's actually...
[02:12:35.433 --> 02:12:56.305]  Kind of shocking to me as a middle-aged man who was raised with classic American civic nationalism, you know, very proud to be colorblind, all that sort of thing.
[02:12:56.305 --> 02:13:03.369]  It's been a real shock to me to listen to the way that the young guys talk in
[02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:09.845]  Uh, the football clubs in the social groups and so forth.
[02:13:09.845 --> 02:13:14.069]  There's a reason why they've been nicknamed generations.
[02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:18.693]  I clone because they simply do not believe anything.
[02:13:19.995 --> 02:13:22.316]  That they're being taught in school.
[02:13:22.316 --> 02:13:28.819]  They don't even believe in sort of the reasonable civic nationalism that you and I tend to believe.
[02:13:28.819 --> 02:13:29.079]  You're right.
[02:13:29.079 --> 02:13:31.360]  They're very, very cynical.
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:36.402]  Even the minorities, who are the majority now below 40, they don't buy stuff either.
[02:13:36.402 --> 02:13:41.725]  I don't think the establishment realizes they have completely lost the youth.
[02:13:41.725 --> 02:13:43.505]  No, there's no question they have.
[02:13:43.505 --> 02:13:47.967]  I mean, you know, it's very, very simple.
[02:13:47.967 --> 02:13:49.288]  When you're told one thing,
[02:13:50.603 --> 02:13:54.064]  And you experience the direct opposite.
[02:13:54.064 --> 02:13:58.506]  You're not going to believe anything else that that authority tells you.
[02:13:58.506 --> 02:14:14.993]  And so, you know, it's very easy for people of our generation to talk about this whole shiny, equalitarian, non-racial... But the left flipped the script and totally betrayed that.
[02:14:14.993 --> 02:14:15.913]  And so let's just say it.
[02:14:15.913 --> 02:14:17.994]  It's making everybody get real tribal real quick.
[02:14:19.907 --> 02:14:27.728]  It's partly that, but it's also partly the fact that there's 65 million post-1965 immigrants.
[02:14:27.728 --> 02:14:40.611]  I mean, this is the largest migration in human history, and as the great military historian Martin Van Krebbel writes, migration always leads to war.
[02:14:40.611 --> 02:14:43.351]  Human movement always leads to war.
[02:14:43.351 --> 02:14:46.612]  That's what causes all the wars.
[02:14:46.612 --> 02:14:48.372]  Certainly a high percentage of them.
[02:14:50.407 --> 02:15:00.756]  So basically, and Trump gets that and so does the Pentagon, not that they're perfect, we're going into a major destabilization, even if we try to fix things, we're looking at really dangerous next three decades.
[02:15:00.756 --> 02:15:04.159]  And instead the left's trying to make it as bad as possible for short-term gain.
[02:15:04.159 --> 02:15:07.061]  They are insane!
[02:15:07.061 --> 02:15:16.689]  Well, if they had any grasp of consequences, if they were able to follow a logical train of thought, they wouldn't be leftists.
[02:15:16.689 --> 02:15:18.611]  And so we just have to deal with the reality
[02:15:19.332 --> 02:15:22.077]  That warning them is not going to help.
[02:15:22.077 --> 02:15:26.284]  Oh yeah, they seem to think we warn them lovingly that we're weak.
[02:15:26.284 --> 02:15:29.990]  We're like, no, we just don't want to endanger our own lives destroying them.
[02:15:31.542 --> 02:15:32.483]  Precisely.
[02:15:32.483 --> 02:15:36.706]  But the fact is, is that warning them hasn't worked for the last 30 years.
[02:15:36.706 --> 02:15:40.248]  Republicans have been saying, oh, you're not going to like the consequences.
[02:15:40.248 --> 02:15:41.229]  Well, guess what?
[02:15:41.229 --> 02:15:43.470]  They don't understand the consequences.
[02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:45.632]  So warning them doesn't do you any good.
[02:15:45.632 --> 02:15:49.295]  So let's talk about time frames here for societal collapse and meltdown.
[02:15:49.295 --> 02:15:53.978]  If the Trump nationalist experiment doesn't work, which is a valiant effort, but it will probably fail.

[02:17:26.508 --> 02:17:30.430]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:31.971]  I sued the IRS and won.

[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.081]  Look, I want to be a cheerleader for Trump.
[02:20:27.081 --> 02:20:29.323]  And the guy is awesome.
[02:20:29.323 --> 02:20:32.105]  I mean, he's really hitting his stride now.
[02:20:32.105 --> 02:20:36.228]  His work ethic, everything he's done, it's so focused, it's pragmatic.
[02:20:36.228 --> 02:20:37.628]  He's just the real deal.
[02:20:37.628 --> 02:20:38.929]  He's pro-human.
[02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:41.891]  I'm very honored to be persecuted alongside him with all of you.
[02:20:41.891 --> 02:20:46.494]  But Vox Dei researcher, writer, smart guy to share with us.
[02:20:46.494 --> 02:20:50.657]  He said the Federal Reserve is saying in Reuters, oh, we're going to stop the prosperity.
[02:20:50.657 --> 02:20:53.579]  We're going to raise interest rates really high to stop Trump.
[02:20:53.579 --> 02:20:54.680]  I mean, that's in Reuters here today.
[02:20:55.860 --> 02:21:00.222]  So we just have to realize that everyone should be totally behind Trump.
[02:21:00.222 --> 02:21:05.103]  China is working with the Vatican to dox real Catholics and kill them.
[02:21:05.103 --> 02:21:20.409]  And it's like the Pope's a good... I mean the stuff going on is so manifestly evil that the fact that we're barely winning right now shows the idea that the West projects its own superiority and culture onto everything else.
[02:21:21.482 --> 02:21:24.724]  And then we sit here, and then meanwhile, it's not superior.
[02:21:24.724 --> 02:21:26.725]  That's why people all want to come here.
[02:21:26.725 --> 02:21:30.626]  And I'm not putting anybody down, but those cultures never ignited the way we did.
[02:21:30.626 --> 02:21:32.828]  And you get into debates about, well, you're cave people.
[02:21:32.828 --> 02:21:33.348]  I don't care.
[02:21:33.348 --> 02:21:34.248]  I love everybody.
[02:21:34.248 --> 02:21:35.529]  I want freedom.
[02:21:35.529 --> 02:21:37.610]  There are great people in every culture, every region.
[02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:43.413]  The point is, the globalists are at war with the West because it's where the Christians said we're not going to have slavery.
[02:21:43.413 --> 02:21:45.214]  It's where women got the right to vote.
[02:21:45.214 --> 02:21:49.636]  So the authoritarians can't beat that, so they flip it and create all these twisted rights.
[02:21:50.316 --> 02:21:52.276]  It's in their own admissions they're totally wicked.
[02:21:52.276 --> 02:21:55.277]  So, Vox, I want to give you some positive news here.
[02:21:55.277 --> 02:22:05.700]  But first, long-term prognosis of why you're saying that the weakness of humanity and the sinful nature, I guess, at the end of the day.
[02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:07.620]  Let's look at the bad prognosis versus the good.
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:12.241]  And then, in the short term, you're a proponent of a red wave.
[02:22:12.241 --> 02:22:16.082]  I believe it, unless the election fraud is just over the top as a seawall.
[02:22:16.082 --> 02:22:19.623]  So, let's look at the bad long-term, the good short-term with Vox Day.
[02:22:21.465 --> 02:22:33.312]  The bad long term is that I would expect the USA to break apart as a political entity in the 2033 timeframe.
[02:22:33.312 --> 02:22:38.316]  And that's based on the economic situation.
[02:22:38.316 --> 02:22:45.580]  It's based on the average lifespan of currencies and everything that I've seen.
[02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:48.062]  This is a prediction I made about 14 years ago and
[02:22:50.544 --> 02:22:55.466]  Everything that I've seen indicates that it's on track.
[02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:57.107]  Oh, the globalists even plan that.
[02:22:57.107 --> 02:22:58.267]  But can't we?
[02:22:58.267 --> 02:22:59.588]  Let's just say it.
[02:22:59.588 --> 02:23:02.869]  We want freedom, but we're dealing with authoritarian outside forces.
[02:23:02.869 --> 02:23:15.174]  If we crack down, and we have to figure out the way to do that, culturally, to create a new level playing field, if we crack down on the tyranny and the outside forces, we could probably get around that.
[02:23:15.174 --> 02:23:18.516]  Yeah, there's a good chance, but the problem is that even
[02:23:19.782 --> 02:23:31.506]  As great and as insightful a leader as Donald Trump is not really looking at the real issues as far as I understand.
[02:23:31.506 --> 02:23:39.168]  In Europe, there are leaders who are looking directly at the demographic issues, who are looking at
[02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:55.954]  Doing what they call reportations, which is returning a lot of the refugees and migrants and economic migrants and even citizens to their former countries.
[02:23:55.954 --> 02:24:00.276]  That's a whole debate that doesn't even exist in the United States.
[02:24:00.276 --> 02:24:06.958]  And I don't know that it can exist in the United States because of our historical
[02:24:07.998 --> 02:24:14.623]  Friendly attitude towards immigration and the fact that there's no strong nativist nationalist party in the states.
[02:24:14.623 --> 02:24:30.915]  And let's be clear, isn't it because Soros and the UN are weaponizing the third world that that is doomed to fail A, then B. Isn't Russia though, with their collapsing population, all their problems, the model, can they be successful realizing that this was an exterminism plan?
[02:24:30.915 --> 02:24:34.038]  Can the Russian model be successful and could it be duplicated?
[02:24:36.057 --> 02:24:41.520]  Yes, the Russian model... First of all, the Russian nation is not dying.
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:43.180]  The Russian nation is actually... No, I mean, under the globalists.
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:45.722]  Under the globalists, they wanted to.
[02:24:45.722 --> 02:24:53.785]  Oh, yeah, the globalists wanted to, but under Putin, the average lifespan in Russia has increased dramatically.
[02:24:53.785 --> 02:25:01.729]  And a strong pro-Christian, pro-nationalist government
[02:25:02.839 --> 02:25:05.180]  Can significantly change things.
[02:25:05.180 --> 02:25:18.247]  You know, a lot of people when they talk about a nation dying, it's really ridiculous because if you look at how many people there are, there's far more people in every country than there's ever been.
[02:25:18.247 --> 02:25:27.251]  Britain ruled, you know, Britain established the empire in which the sun never set with far fewer white British people than they have today.
[02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:27.972]  Because they had will.
[02:25:29.895 --> 02:25:35.179]  Right, because they had will, and they had cultural confidence, and because they had hope, and they had faith.
[02:25:35.179 --> 02:25:41.964]  And we need to see a revival of muscular Christianity.
[02:25:41.964 --> 02:25:45.306]  We need to see a revival of national pride.
[02:25:45.306 --> 02:25:47.227]  Because if we don't, we will be conquered.
[02:25:47.227 --> 02:25:49.249]  That's the way the world works.
[02:25:49.249 --> 02:25:52.851]  Precisely.
[02:25:52.851 --> 02:25:56.274]  But you see the ignition of populism and Christianity happening again.
[02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:59.591]  And the pedophile-controlled Catholic Church in trouble.
[02:25:59.591 --> 02:26:03.353]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of really good signs, Fox.
[02:26:03.353 --> 02:26:04.834]  Well, there are good signs.
[02:26:04.834 --> 02:26:13.357]  But the problem is, what a lot of people don't seem to understand is that winning is going to involve conflict.
[02:26:13.357 --> 02:26:20.201]  And we've gone a long, long time in the United States without having to deal with war.
[02:26:21.727 --> 02:26:24.209]  directly on our doorstep.
[02:26:24.209 --> 02:26:32.854]  And I agree, so let's, if men aren't even willing to have politically correct people attack them, or to be banned, or to have them go up your bank account, you'll never stand up when the rubber meets the road.
[02:26:32.854 --> 02:26:38.778]  So what's your message to men about how we wage war against globalism now?
[02:26:38.778 --> 02:26:43.982]  I think the most important thing is to not be afraid.
[02:26:43.982 --> 02:26:48.645]  You know, my grandfather volunteered
[02:26:49.577 --> 02:26:50.077]  for the U.S.
[02:26:50.077 --> 02:26:53.399]  Marines the day after Pearl Harbor.
[02:26:53.399 --> 02:27:11.249]  And one thing he told me was that when you're on a beach and there's a bunch of people shooting at you and everybody looks at you to see what to do, he said, just do something.
[02:27:11.249 --> 02:27:14.591]  He said, it doesn't even matter what.
[02:27:14.591 --> 02:27:18.133]  Pick something, do it, and the next thing you know,
[02:27:19.268 --> 02:27:21.649]  30 men will be right there behind you.
[02:27:21.649 --> 02:27:22.149]  Exactly.
[02:27:22.149 --> 02:27:24.770]  Take action.
[02:27:24.770 --> 02:27:30.352]  And it doesn't necessarily... ...action is.
[02:27:30.352 --> 02:27:37.994]  The idea that, you know, sitting around playing armchair strategist is somehow going to change the world is ridiculous.
[02:27:38.712 --> 02:27:44.035]  What changes the world is people acting, people doing things.
[02:27:44.035 --> 02:27:47.278]  And I totally agree because your conscious brain doesn't know what to do.
[02:27:47.278 --> 02:27:48.658]  Your subconscious does.
[02:27:48.658 --> 02:27:55.543]  And once you go into action, you're going to find that some of the most directed action you'll ever have is when you're not even thinking.
[02:27:55.543 --> 02:28:01.166]  Well, not only that, but, you know, if something works, then you reinforce success.
[02:28:01.166 --> 02:28:04.128]  If something doesn't work, then you do something else.
[02:28:04.128 --> 02:28:06.530]  It's not rocket science.
[02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:07.951]  But but unfortunately,
[02:28:08.979 --> 02:28:20.483]  We're so used to abstracting things and trying to plan things and trying to figure out all the possible alternatives, which is not possible, that we tend to paralyze ourselves.
[02:28:20.483 --> 02:28:21.183]  No, I totally agree.
[02:28:21.183 --> 02:28:22.664]  Get out of the catatonic state.
[02:28:22.664 --> 02:28:23.904]  Move.
[02:28:23.904 --> 02:28:24.725]  Move.
[02:28:24.725 --> 02:28:26.806]  That's the answer.
[02:28:26.806 --> 02:28:27.786]  Yeah, and so, you know,
[02:28:29.049 --> 02:28:33.973]  You get shut down by Twitter, go on to Gab, go on to OneWay.
[02:28:33.973 --> 02:28:37.776]  You get shut down by YouTube, go on to BitChute.
[02:28:37.776 --> 02:28:42.299]  You get shut down by PayPal, talk to Stripe, create your own payment processor.
[02:28:42.299 --> 02:28:43.840]  Just do something.
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:51.887]  And go back to YouTube under pen names or whatever you have to, and then go protest at YouTube, and then sue YouTube, and sue PayPal, and other things that are coming.
[02:28:51.887 --> 02:28:53.127]  We'll be right back with Vox Day.
[02:28:53.127 --> 02:28:53.588]  Stay with us.
[02:28:56.564 --> 02:28:57.784]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:57.784 --> 02:29:01.705]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:01.705 --> 02:29:03.225]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:03.225 --> 02:29:06.206]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:06.206 --> 02:29:11.747]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:11.747 --> 02:29:12.967]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:12.967 --> 02:29:15.887]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:15.887 --> 02:29:18.108]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:29:56.429 --> 02:30:04.818]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:04.818 --> 02:30:06.279]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:06.279 --> 02:30:11.004]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:11.004 --> 02:30:15.989]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:30:16.209 --> 02:30:36.373]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:32:59.446 --> 02:33:02.108]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:07.375 --> 02:33:07.976]  You've got it.
[02:33:07.976 --> 02:33:14.483]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:14.483 --> 02:33:18.887]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:18.887 --> 02:33:24.553]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:26.708 --> 02:33:35.852]  So, Twitter has banned everybody from myself to James Woods, to you name it, for what they claim is racist or hateful or oppressive or demeaning.
[02:33:35.852 --> 02:33:37.533]  Now they say dehumanizing.
[02:33:37.533 --> 02:33:54.441]  But there are stories up on Infowars.com that show the Antifa group that's been doxing Gavin McInnes and, you know, saying terrible things about him and his family and how they're going to kill him and say they're going to kill the vice president and doing all these other horrible things and chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants with his wife.
[02:33:56.164 --> 02:34:02.647]  They are all over Twitter calling for violence, but they get to stay up.
[02:34:02.647 --> 02:34:07.709]  But now a new nebulous term, ban dehumanizing speech.
[02:34:07.709 --> 02:34:12.611]  Major hospitals are refusing to call newborn baby boys and girls, boys and girls.
[02:34:12.611 --> 02:34:15.012]  That's dehumanizing.
[02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:19.394]  Attacking the very biological foundation of the species.
[02:34:19.394 --> 02:34:23.315]  Attacking reality itself.
[02:34:23.315 --> 02:34:24.376]  But oh, don't worry, Jack.
[02:34:25.506 --> 02:34:30.972]  Dorsey's going to ban what they call dehumanizing and leave people up.
[02:34:30.972 --> 02:34:39.662]  I mean, I've got an article here about this MSNBC host attacking some white lady saying that she was saying racist things she did and saying, I want to kill you.
[02:34:39.662 --> 02:34:40.723]  You're a piece of crap.
[02:34:40.723 --> 02:34:42.264]  You should be murdered.
[02:34:42.264 --> 02:34:43.045]  Twitter leaves that up.
[02:34:44.116 --> 02:34:45.777]  So, it's the craziest stuff.
[02:34:45.777 --> 02:34:50.220]  If I run into a CNN reporter who's been lobbying to have me banned, and I go, how dare you?
[02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:51.281]  You're a modern book burner.
[02:34:51.281 --> 02:34:52.562]  That is so disgusting.
[02:34:52.562 --> 02:34:56.784]  In a public place, he's a man I'm banned for attacking a protected group.
[02:34:56.784 --> 02:34:59.746]  Now, journalists, oh, they can lie about the president all day.
[02:34:59.746 --> 02:35:00.767]  He calls them liars.
[02:35:00.767 --> 02:35:02.428]  That's attacking the press and free speech.
[02:35:02.428 --> 02:35:03.028]  No.
[02:35:03.028 --> 02:35:07.991]  Countering liars and saying you're liars is free speech.
[02:35:07.991 --> 02:35:08.912]  But that's the spin.
[02:35:08.912 --> 02:35:09.853]  Oh, I've got free speech.
[02:35:10.433 --> 02:35:11.374]  Don't restrict my speech.
[02:35:11.374 --> 02:35:14.176]  The left means don't disagree with me while I hit you over the head with a bike lock.
[02:35:14.176 --> 02:35:18.479]  Now, we sell the first four installments.
[02:35:18.479 --> 02:35:19.881]  Two more are coming out.
[02:35:19.881 --> 02:35:21.882]  We have sold out, I think, twice of these.
[02:35:21.882 --> 02:35:22.943]  So it's very, very popular.
[02:35:22.943 --> 02:35:25.885]  It's great for your children, great for your teenagers, great for you.
[02:35:25.885 --> 02:35:28.627]  Really great artwork.
[02:35:28.627 --> 02:35:32.631]  And it also shows women very, very empowered, but also very, very feminine, that they don't look like men.
[02:35:33.917 --> 02:35:36.842]  Alt Hero, number one, Crackdown.
[02:35:36.842 --> 02:35:40.228]  We've got Alt Hero, number two, Rebel Cell.
[02:35:40.228 --> 02:35:41.590]  Number three, Reprisal.
[02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:44.174]  Number four, The War in Paris.
[02:35:44.174 --> 02:35:45.817]  They're all available at infowarestore.com.
[02:35:47.907 --> 02:35:49.168]  I'm sure they'll sell out in a couple of days.
[02:35:49.168 --> 02:35:53.271]  You can always get them over at Vox Day's website as well.
[02:35:53.271 --> 02:35:56.873]  But let's talk about the culture war then in the short term.
[02:35:56.873 --> 02:36:00.356]  I do think you agree we're winning globally because we're starting to fight back.
[02:36:00.356 --> 02:36:06.200]  My God, we're selling freedom and truly open societies and things that really have been proven to work.
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:08.482]  So the fact that we finally show up shows that we're winning.
[02:36:09.503 --> 02:36:17.671]  Let's talk about the comic books and why it upsets the establishment, because no one dared have nationalistic or patriotic or common sense comics.
[02:36:17.671 --> 02:36:20.413]  So surprise, surprise, they're already bestsellers.
[02:36:20.413 --> 02:36:23.356]  And what type of opposition have you run into?
[02:36:23.356 --> 02:36:26.560]  And then let's get more into the red wave.
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:30.764]  Well, right now, there's a tremendous amount of attack
[02:36:31.603 --> 02:36:35.184]  on right wing, and not really even right wing.
[02:36:35.184 --> 02:36:37.465]  They're basically moderates.
[02:36:37.465 --> 02:36:48.789]  But in the comics industry terms, the comic industry is so far left that they consider these guys, you know, to be hard, hard extremist right, which is rather amusing.
[02:36:48.789 --> 02:36:55.471]  But Marvel and DC have continued to move to the left.
[02:36:55.471 --> 02:36:59.573]  And so they're pushing things like transgenderism in Bad Girl,
[02:37:00.137 --> 02:37:05.441]  They're pushing homosexuality in a number of different comics and so forth.
[02:37:05.441 --> 02:37:14.667]  And so people have reacted really badly to this because they're actually eliminating and destroying a lot of the old characters that people liked.
[02:37:14.667 --> 02:37:18.549]  You know, Wolverine's replaced by a girl.
[02:37:18.549 --> 02:37:20.831]  Thor is replaced by a woman.
[02:37:20.831 --> 02:37:24.093]  Spider-Man's replaced by a gay Hispanic kid.
[02:37:24.093 --> 02:37:28.416]  It's just, and they're bringing in all kinds of
[02:37:29.329 --> 02:37:32.471]  anti-American messages intentionally.
[02:37:32.471 --> 02:37:45.679]  In fact, the incredible thing is that the vice president, Marvel's vice president of content creation, is actually Huma Abedin's cousin.
[02:37:45.679 --> 02:37:50.863]  And so, you know, that's a connection you never see them drawing in the media.
[02:37:50.863 --> 02:37:52.624]  And what's interesting
[02:37:53.343 --> 02:37:56.384]  Is that the fans are revolting against this.
[02:37:56.384 --> 02:38:08.506]  And so if you go on to places like Kickstarter Indiegogo, you can see that these independent comics are exploding in popularity.
[02:38:08.506 --> 02:38:13.607]  There's one guy we don't get along terribly well, but he's been extremely successful.
[02:38:13.607 --> 02:38:14.427]  A former D.C.
[02:38:14.427 --> 02:38:17.827]  artist named Ethan VanSkyver.
[02:38:17.827 --> 02:38:21.048]  His Indiegogo campaign raised over $500,000.
[02:38:22.924 --> 02:38:28.510]  And so it's because people are so tired of the orthodoxy.
[02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:30.012]  It's not even left or right.
[02:38:30.012 --> 02:38:31.293]  And here's the deal.
[02:38:31.293 --> 02:38:35.658]  You want your kids to have comic books where it's not, it wouldn't all be about sex anyways.
[02:38:35.658 --> 02:38:37.539]  You don't want to sexualize children.
[02:38:37.539 --> 02:38:44.186]  It's like I was reading an article today about another library and the adult section is having drag queens there to pole dance for children.
[02:38:44.747 --> 02:38:46.068]  They're like, oh, you're against drag queens.
[02:38:46.068 --> 02:38:47.909]  I'm against sexualizing children.
[02:38:47.909 --> 02:38:51.652]  But oh, as long as it's LBGT, it's OK to do this to kids.
[02:38:51.652 --> 02:38:55.275]  And literally, it's recruiting kids into that, which is pedophilia.
[02:38:55.275 --> 02:38:58.398]  I mean, it's just amazing to see this happening.
[02:38:58.398 --> 02:39:03.862]  So continuing, tell us about Alt-Hero, because I know they've been a big success so far.
[02:39:03.862 --> 02:39:14.310]  Yeah, Alt-Hero is a series that is designed to portray the battle between
[02:39:15.254 --> 02:39:19.177]  The globalist and the nationalist perspectives.
[02:39:19.177 --> 02:39:31.024]  Now, a lot of people were very surprised when they read it because they were expecting some sort of polemic or screed or polar opposite of what you get from Marvel or DC.
[02:39:31.024 --> 02:39:32.024]  But we didn't do that.
[02:39:32.024 --> 02:39:35.607]  And we don't do that because you can't tell a good story that way.
[02:39:35.607 --> 02:39:44.112]  The only way that you can tell a good story is by allowing the characters and the perspective to speak honestly for itself.
[02:39:44.722 --> 02:40:08.176]  So, for example, Captain Europa, who is the EU superhero who's on the cover of The War in Paris, some of his dialogue is actually words that were spoken by Emmanuel Macron, the current president of France, who is, of course, very strong pro-EU, very much a globalist and that sort of thing.
[02:40:08.176 --> 02:40:11.498]  You cannot engage in an honest debate
[02:40:12.401 --> 02:40:16.903]  If you do not present both sides accurately and honestly.
[02:40:16.903 --> 02:40:30.448]  Now, there's obviously no question about which side I'm on, but the ironic fact is, we present a better and more honest argument for globalism than most of the globalists do.
[02:40:30.448 --> 02:40:38.912]  Because, you know, they're not willing to speak openly about what it is that they want to do, and why they want to do it, and why they believe that's the right thing.
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:46.485]  For mankind, you know, they genuinely believe that this is what's necessary to prevent war.
[02:40:46.485 --> 02:40:48.006]  There is an idealism.
[02:40:49.011 --> 02:40:50.051]  Well, but that's their cover.
[02:40:50.051 --> 02:40:54.033]  Like, Emperor Palpatine says, I want total tyranny, so we'll have peace.
[02:40:54.033 --> 02:40:58.034]  I mean, that's the sick argument, is there's no free will, there'll be peace.
[02:40:58.034 --> 02:41:00.414]  These people, I've found, are very, very monstrous.
[02:41:00.414 --> 02:41:10.137]  And you also are, you know, courting SPLC demonization by one of your characters sports the Confederate battle flag.
[02:41:10.137 --> 02:41:12.918]  So tell us about that.
[02:41:12.918 --> 02:41:15.659]  Well, actually, in that case, we had to avoid doing that.
[02:41:16.528 --> 02:41:20.533]  Um, you know, it's acceptable to have have the mask.
[02:41:20.533 --> 02:41:31.865]  Um, originally we had her full outfit, uh, like the Confederate flag, but because Amazon has a, uh, no Confederate flag policy.
[02:41:32.913 --> 02:41:48.124]  If we wanted to allow it to be sold there, we had to, you know, you can see there, she's just wearing a... Which I understand why you do that, but now it's the okay symbol, now it's, they're just constantly, now a federal judge says, is America first racist?
[02:41:48.124 --> 02:41:49.144]  Maybe that should be banned.
[02:41:49.144 --> 02:41:50.465]  Here's a Bloomberg article.
[02:41:50.465 --> 02:41:54.628]  So you see how they just can keep adding new, like, don't say Alex Jones or you get banned.
[02:41:54.628 --> 02:41:55.449]  It just, it never ends.
[02:41:56.371 --> 02:41:57.192]  Oh, there's no question.
[02:41:57.192 --> 02:42:00.775]  But that's why we need to build our own platforms.
[02:42:00.775 --> 02:42:04.298]  That's why we need to go our own way.
[02:42:04.298 --> 02:42:16.650]  Because one of the problems with the conservative approach over the past 50 years is that it's been constant retreat, but trying to remain engaged.
[02:42:16.650 --> 02:42:18.631]  And there's no possible way to win there.
[02:42:18.631 --> 02:42:19.973]  You're not going to
[02:42:21.087 --> 02:42:24.109]  Beat Google while you're playing Google's game.
[02:42:24.109 --> 02:42:30.332]  You're not going to beat Google by appearing on YouTube.
[02:42:30.332 --> 02:42:31.273]  No, I totally agree.
[02:42:31.273 --> 02:42:34.875]  You only use those platforms to help drive people to your big platform.
[02:42:34.875 --> 02:42:35.655]  That's how you defeat them.
[02:42:35.655 --> 02:42:37.416]  Vox Days, our guest.
[02:42:37.416 --> 02:42:40.758]  We're in the middle of this 16-hour broadcast that goes to midnight tonight.
[02:42:42.205 --> 02:42:44.689]  Stand with Trump, stand with him forward, stand with free speech.
[02:42:44.689 --> 02:42:49.536]  Whatever you do, listening on AM, FM, radio, TV, spread those links.
[02:42:49.536 --> 02:42:52.280]  I know I keep saying it, but you're the reason we're winning, folks.
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:54.283]  You're the reason you're overriding the censors.
[02:42:55.287 --> 02:43:01.772]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:43:01.772 --> 02:43:08.617]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:43:08.617 --> 02:43:24.150]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:43:25.296 --> 02:43:29.119]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:43:29.119 --> 02:43:34.362]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:43:34.362 --> 02:43:35.663]  And here's the best part.
[02:43:35.663 --> 02:43:37.504]  It is absolutely free.
[02:43:37.504 --> 02:43:42.708]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:43:42.708 --> 02:43:46.670]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:50.793]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point blank range.
[02:43:50.793 --> 02:43:54.896]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:43:55.616 --> 02:44:00.877]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:44:00.877 --> 02:44:09.539]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:44:09.539 --> 02:44:11.519]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:44:11.519 --> 02:44:14.980]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:17.621]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:44:17.621 --> 02:44:19.161]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:44:19.881 --> 02:44:32.306]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[02:44:33.484 --> 02:44:37.188]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:44:37.188 --> 02:44:38.369]  We'll win.
[02:44:38.369 --> 02:44:41.272]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[02:44:41.272 --> 02:44:46.598]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[02:44:46.598 --> 02:44:48.440]  And you're right, to the market.
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:52.144]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[02:44:52.144 --> 02:44:53.685]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[02:44:53.685 --> 02:44:54.546]  We need your support.
[02:44:54.546 --> 02:44:55.107]  I'm counting on you.
[02:44:56.536 --> 02:45:02.798]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.
[02:45:02.798 --> 02:45:07.159]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[02:45:07.159 --> 02:45:12.541]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.

[02:45:30.853 --> 02:45:37.758]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.

[02:45:56.073 --> 02:46:03.639]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:16.026]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:46:16.026 --> 02:46:18.147]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:46:18.147 --> 02:46:21.889]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:21.889 --> 02:46:23.370]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but
[02:46:23.610 --> 02:46:31.796]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:46:31.796 --> 02:46:34.437]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:46:34.437 --> 02:46:37.239]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:46:37.239 --> 02:46:39.721]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:39.721 --> 02:46:48.927]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:46:48.927 --> 02:46:53.370]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:01.405]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:27.546 --> 02:47:31.149]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:47:31.149 --> 02:47:35.392]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:35.392 --> 02:47:37.014]  Alright, I'll answer my question from earlier.
[02:47:37.014 --> 02:47:40.336]  Vox did a pretty good job of it from another angle.
[02:47:40.336 --> 02:47:42.858]  They hate me because they hate you.
[02:47:42.858 --> 02:47:45.601]  And this is a broadcast where we can talk.
[02:47:45.601 --> 02:47:46.822]  We have all these great guests on.
[02:47:46.822 --> 02:47:47.582]  We have the callers.
[02:47:47.582 --> 02:47:48.283]  We have community.
[02:47:49.838 --> 02:47:51.859]  And I genuinely am not scared of them.
[02:47:51.859 --> 02:47:54.440]  I'm genuinely having fun fighting them.
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:59.222]  I'm genuinely getting stronger as they attack me, even in some ways as I get weaker.
[02:47:59.222 --> 02:48:03.884]  And so that's what angers them because what Vox said is critical.
[02:48:03.884 --> 02:48:18.210]  If you want to understand authoritarians, devil worshippers, Alistair Crowley types, they're all backstabbing, lying, dishonorable, very alone people that all just virtue signal to each other and screw each other over all day long.
[02:48:19.736 --> 02:48:22.817]  And so our mere existence infuriates them.
[02:48:22.817 --> 02:48:33.040]  So they believe they can absorb us, kind of like Karankawa Indians, you know, would catch sailors, you know, Spanish sailors that crashed in Galveston 500 years ago and, you know, eat their livers or brains.
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:34.740]  They thought they were taking on their power.
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:35.760]  And it really is.
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:38.641]  Like, I see somebody with a great-looking wife and successful business.
[02:48:38.641 --> 02:48:39.902]  I think, man, that's a really great person.
[02:48:39.902 --> 02:48:40.922]  Our species is strong.
[02:48:41.542 --> 02:48:43.843]  You know, and somebody that stands up for what's right.
[02:48:43.843 --> 02:48:45.544]  You know, I admire them.
[02:48:45.544 --> 02:48:48.366]  Other people's strength or beauty doesn't make me feel small.
[02:48:48.366 --> 02:48:51.347]  I'm an individualist, but I feel this collective strength in them.
[02:48:51.347 --> 02:48:54.269]  Just like I see weakness and corruption, it makes me feel weak.
[02:48:54.269 --> 02:48:55.589]  Seeing strength makes me feel strong.
[02:48:55.589 --> 02:48:56.870]  I'm not a globalist.
[02:48:58.106 --> 02:48:59.566]  They love fluoride in your water.
[02:48:59.566 --> 02:49:03.127]  They love giving you a vaccine they know is going to give you a neurological disorder.
[02:49:03.127 --> 02:49:08.008]  There's all these big studies out, even today, about fluoride and vaccines causing brain damage.
[02:49:08.008 --> 02:49:10.328]  That's what they do.
[02:49:10.328 --> 02:49:12.849]  Because they hate themselves so much, they're projecting.
[02:49:12.849 --> 02:49:15.169]  So, know this.
[02:49:15.169 --> 02:49:16.370]  We're living in epic times.
[02:49:16.370 --> 02:49:17.370]  We're on this planet.
[02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:18.730]  We're in one hell of an adventure.
[02:49:18.730 --> 02:49:22.411]  The real adventure is happening now in the real world, not on Netflix, not whatever.
[02:49:24.133 --> 02:49:28.194]  You see all entertainment being poisonous because it's global controllable.
[02:49:28.194 --> 02:49:37.656]  Entertainment, jacking into it from the other angle, like these comic books and InfoWarsTore.com is a great way to get these and then donate them to the library.
[02:49:37.656 --> 02:49:39.296]  They'll get read hundreds of times.
[02:49:39.296 --> 02:49:42.777]  Get them and send them with your children to school to give away.
[02:49:42.777 --> 02:49:48.858]  This is really how you change the world, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why they're so horrified.
[02:49:48.858 --> 02:49:49.618]  And then separately,
[02:49:52.563 --> 02:49:56.948]  I mean, I really should be plugging every segment because we're trying to financially shut us down.
[02:49:56.948 --> 02:49:59.071]  But you've been coming through, you've been buying a lot of products and things.
[02:49:59.071 --> 02:50:06.018]  We're trying to take our payment processors away right now and that's the next level of tyrannies barring folks from the marketplace.
[02:50:06.018 --> 02:50:08.902]  They call us Nazis all day, but that's what the Nazis actually did.
[02:50:11.264 --> 02:50:20.835]  We do have X2, the best halogen out there, the good halogen, the best, purest iodine, and it is the last run of it, and it's still 25% off, so I haven't changed the special yet, that's going to end very soon.
[02:50:20.835 --> 02:50:31.688]  You've got Brain Force Plus, 20% more now in each bottle, great nootropic, very healthy, amazing, works great, so you get a lot of energy and stuff, but not, you know, the toxic side effects of it, or the crash.
[02:50:33.231 --> 02:50:35.113]  That's 40% off right now.
[02:50:35.113 --> 02:50:35.853]  That's a big special.
[02:50:35.853 --> 02:50:38.535]  We've got our great Vitamin B12.
[02:50:38.535 --> 02:50:40.196]  It's organic and really high quality.
[02:50:40.196 --> 02:50:40.717]  Secret 12.
[02:50:40.717 --> 02:50:43.179]  That is 40% off right now.
[02:50:43.179 --> 02:50:45.541]  And just a bunch of other products at mforestore.com.
[02:50:45.541 --> 02:50:52.386]  And if you go there and keep buying the products or sign up for auto ships, you don't have to forget for the coffee and the supplements, then cancel any time, get an additional 10% off.
[02:50:52.386 --> 02:50:54.607]  We have Patriot Points.
[02:50:54.607 --> 02:50:56.189]  You can set up an account.
[02:50:56.189 --> 02:50:57.790]  When you order, just click, you want Patriot Points.
[02:50:57.790 --> 02:51:00.772]  It goes right in your account, mforestore.com.
[02:51:00.772 --> 02:51:02.734]  And there's just a lot of other things there that make it easy
[02:51:04.013 --> 02:51:06.580]  To support this broadcast, because believe me, at the end of the day...
[02:51:07.563 --> 02:51:12.445]  I'm not worried about losing InfoWars, or whatever happens to me.
[02:51:12.445 --> 02:51:14.166]  I'm worried about them winning.
[02:51:14.166 --> 02:51:23.209]  And so, we need wind in our sails, we need gunpowder in our political cannons, and you're the ones that provide that, like jets for bombing sorties.
[02:51:23.209 --> 02:51:24.970]  You're loading the fuel, you're loading the bombs.
[02:51:24.970 --> 02:51:27.911]  I mean, you're not beside us, you're at the heart of us.
[02:51:27.911 --> 02:51:30.673]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA2533139.
[02:51:30.673 --> 02:51:32.533]  So, Vox, in closing, we've got about six minutes left.
[02:51:36.835 --> 02:51:39.316]  I've been raising a lot of topics here.
[02:51:39.316 --> 02:51:40.636]  You got some of the red wave.
[02:51:40.636 --> 02:51:43.597]  Can you comment more on what you really think is going to happen with this election?
[02:51:43.597 --> 02:51:46.198]  And then just any other points, because I've been guiding the conversation.
[02:51:46.198 --> 02:51:49.299]  You'd like to relay to folks.
[02:51:49.299 --> 02:51:54.821]  Well, to address the blue wave concept, I said from the beginning that it was ridiculous.
[02:51:54.821 --> 02:51:56.442]  I never bought it for a second.
[02:51:58.414 --> 02:52:03.716]  I have been predicting a Trump slide in 2020 for some time now.
[02:52:03.716 --> 02:52:14.421]  And you may recall that I was one of the very few observers who said that Trump was going to win the presidential election and never wavered from that from, I think, February 2015.
[02:52:14.421 --> 02:52:26.146]  The reason that the Democrats are going to be very disappointed in the midterms is because the economy has been doing well.
[02:52:26.146 --> 02:52:27.507]  Donald Trump has.
[02:52:28.439 --> 02:52:40.882]  Maintained enthusiasm among his supporters, even though he hasn't been as effective at either draining the swamp or building the wall as we would have liked him to be.
[02:52:40.882 --> 02:52:54.025]  You know, the biggest mistake that Trump has made, and I don't want to be too critical here because like I said, he has proven himself so far to be the best president of the 20th century.
[02:52:54.025 --> 02:52:55.365]  He's facing total mutiny.
[02:52:57.737 --> 02:52:57.958]  Right.
[02:52:57.958 --> 02:53:02.744]  The biggest mistake that he's made is that he didn't watch his six.
[02:53:02.744 --> 02:53:05.668]  He didn't bring in... No, you're right.
[02:53:05.668 --> 02:53:08.392]  He should have brought in acolytes, not people out of the swamp.
[02:53:09.634 --> 02:53:10.434]  Exactly.
[02:53:10.434 --> 02:53:17.596]  He got sucked into believing that he needed people with experience and people with credentials.
[02:53:17.596 --> 02:53:18.636]  He didn't.
[02:53:18.636 --> 02:53:26.577]  All he needed and all he needs are people who will do exactly what he tells them to do.
[02:53:26.577 --> 02:53:38.600]  If I were advising him, I would suggest fire everybody and get a bunch of 25-year-old, hardcore, true-believing,
[02:53:39.429 --> 02:53:41.254]  Loyalists.
[02:53:41.254 --> 02:53:45.165]  And they'll figure out how to do whatever it is they need to do to do their jobs.
[02:53:46.047 --> 02:53:50.668]  Yeah, they don't need to have been at the FBI for 30 years to know how to do their job.
[02:53:50.668 --> 02:53:51.148]  I agree.
[02:53:51.148 --> 02:53:51.808]  Look at Strzok.
[02:53:51.808 --> 02:53:52.968]  He's a total mental patient.
[02:53:52.968 --> 02:53:58.649]  You don't want to, and I get Trump wanted navigators, but you get, you know, a Native American group to take you Lewis and Clark across.
[02:53:58.649 --> 02:54:01.030]  He needs a few goblin guides here.
[02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:06.051]  But you just can't bring in all the swamp guys and think because you're sharing power, they're not going to backstab you.
[02:54:06.051 --> 02:54:10.952]  Their nature is that they're all creatures of their system.
[02:54:10.952 --> 02:54:12.572]  And so they're all complete backstabbers.
[02:54:13.988 --> 02:54:19.731]  Well, there's an old English television show that is very educational in this regard.
[02:54:19.731 --> 02:54:24.413]  It's called Yes Minister and then it was called Yes Prime Minister was the follow-up.
[02:54:24.413 --> 02:54:41.242]  And the whole joke was that the elected officials had no power and that the bureaucrats spent their entire time doing exactly whatever they thought best and then convincing the minister that what they wanted to do was really his idea.
[02:54:41.801 --> 02:54:44.663]  And that he had no other choice but to do what they wanted.
[02:54:44.663 --> 02:54:46.364]  So, this is not a new concept.
[02:54:46.364 --> 02:54:50.387]  This is something that, you know, goes back decades.
[02:54:50.387 --> 02:54:55.610]  And so, you know, unfortunately, we've seen the price of that.
[02:54:55.610 --> 02:55:03.915]  We've seen the problem with that because... Totally arrogant nobodies in a culture of all sucking each other's tally-whackers.
[02:55:03.915 --> 02:55:04.876]  I mean, that's what they do.
[02:55:04.876 --> 02:55:08.278]  It's just, it's a sick, sick culture of sycophantic nobodies.
[02:55:09.810 --> 02:55:21.640]  But I actually think that it's normal in a bureaucracy to sort of ignore the elected official who's only going to be there for a period of time.
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:33.991]  And, you know, in some ways it might have been better if he'd gone back to the Andrew Jackson system of spoils, where you bring in your loyalists, get rid of all the bureaucrats, and then you can, you know, get your agenda passed.
[02:55:33.991 --> 02:55:35.733]  So I think that
[02:55:37.417 --> 02:55:40.519]  What Trump needs to do is he needs to trust himself.
[02:55:40.519 --> 02:55:48.063]  And he needs to stop assuming that you can convince people and that you can negotiate and that sort of thing.
[02:55:48.063 --> 02:55:49.924]  He just needs people that will do exactly what he tells them to do.
[02:55:49.924 --> 02:55:53.266]  Oh, look how he threatened to release the secret documents and they all started groveling.
[02:55:53.266 --> 02:55:54.727]  I agree with you.
[02:55:54.727 --> 02:55:59.029]  What do you think in the next 40 days they're going to try to pull, to try to derail this?
[02:55:59.029 --> 02:56:04.132]  Because they're really, I mean, if Kavanaugh gets confirmed, which I think is going to happen, they are going to go into meltdown mode.
[02:56:06.046 --> 02:56:06.906]  Oh, there's no question.
[02:56:06.906 --> 02:56:15.129]  But I think that they're going to behave themselves to a certain extent because they genuinely believe in this mythical blue wave.
[02:56:15.129 --> 02:56:23.391]  And so they think that they're going to get a Democratic House and possibly a Democratic Senate and impeach him.
[02:56:23.391 --> 02:56:26.392]  And there is no chance in hell that that's going to happen.
[02:56:27.552 --> 02:56:28.533]  And I agree with you.
[02:56:28.533 --> 02:56:31.075]  So the insanity is going to continue to intensify.
[02:56:31.075 --> 02:56:33.456]  And I think that's our biggest hope.
[02:56:33.456 --> 02:56:41.522]  I'm not glad they're going to do it, but I think they're going to go so far that that will counterman normal political reshuffling.
[02:56:41.522 --> 02:56:47.406]  But I think their extremism, their bullying, will force the full realignment.
[02:56:47.406 --> 02:56:51.169]  I think the Democrats are our best ally.
[02:56:51.169 --> 02:56:52.150]  To a certain extent.
[02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:55.212]  But the problem on the Republican side is that
[02:56:57.100 --> 02:57:04.365]  They have not yet fully embraced the identity politics that they're going to have to embrace if they want to remain competitive.
[02:57:04.365 --> 02:57:18.095]  Running around anointing every black pseudo-conservative that you can find and immediately handing them a show on Fox or a congressional district isn't going to work.
[02:57:18.095 --> 02:57:19.416]  It's never worked.
[02:57:19.416 --> 02:57:22.118]  And so what they need to understand is that
[02:57:22.842 --> 02:57:25.323]  The people who are for you are for you.
[02:57:25.323 --> 02:57:26.564]  People who are not are not.
[02:57:26.564 --> 02:57:28.105]  And that's the way it's going to be.
[02:57:45.396 --> 02:57:47.737]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:57:47.737 --> 02:57:49.897]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:59:49.765 --> 02:59:52.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:11.374 --> 03:00:16.317]  Alright folks, Roger Stone's coming up in the next segment, and then we're going to continue on to midnight tonight.
[03:00:16.317 --> 03:00:19.059]  I'm going to be back tonight, basically 7 o'clock on.
[03:00:19.059 --> 03:00:27.324]  We've got a bunch of big guests joining us this evening, and we're just doing another, you know, live broadcast right up until midnight, defensive free speech.
[03:00:27.324 --> 03:00:28.645]  I'm not whining and complaining.
[03:00:28.645 --> 03:00:32.508]  I'm very, very thankful for all the listeners and things you've done.
[03:00:32.508 --> 03:00:40.313]  Because you understand we're all in the same boat together, but man, there are so many Islamic stabbing and mass truck attacks, a hundred people run into yesterday, and
[03:00:41.218 --> 03:00:49.420]  Islamic groups in Germany going and just shooting people in clubs and it's insane.
[03:00:49.420 --> 03:00:56.882]  And I just look at the globalists doing this to America and Europe and they're just destructive weirdos.
[03:00:56.882 --> 03:01:07.485]  But then you look at Alexander Soros and Obama and then you realize just the type of existential hatred they have for everybody.
[03:01:09.195 --> 03:01:29.365]  I mean, these are nasty, nasty, nasty people, chaos creators, who for whatever reason have this feeling that they're not part of America, so if they could conquer it and mess it up as bad as possible, that they would somehow be big boys then.
[03:01:29.365 --> 03:01:32.327]  And so that's the point people really have to get into.
[03:01:32.327 --> 03:01:34.528]  I mean, look at this headline.
[03:01:34.528 --> 03:01:38.150]  Driver runs into crowd of a hundred children and teachers in Sweden.
[03:01:39.608 --> 03:01:43.450]  And another truck attack in Germany.
[03:01:43.450 --> 03:01:48.932]  And it's like Sadiq Khan said two years ago, he goes, the Islamic mayor of London, he goes, you'll just get used to it.
[03:01:48.932 --> 03:01:49.872]  And it's kind of true.
[03:01:49.872 --> 03:01:52.393]  It's like, oh, 100 acid attacks this week.
[03:01:52.393 --> 03:01:53.353]  Oh, no big deal.
[03:01:53.353 --> 03:01:55.434]  Oh, another big Islamic child kidnapping ring.
[03:01:55.434 --> 03:01:57.095]  Oh, no big deal.
[03:01:57.095 --> 03:01:58.455]  Oh, no big deal.
[03:01:58.455 --> 03:02:01.157]  Just a driver runs into a crowd of 100 children and teachers.
[03:02:01.157 --> 03:02:02.137]  Yeah, no big deal.
[03:02:02.137 --> 03:02:03.578]  It's no big deal.
[03:02:03.578 --> 03:02:04.578]  MSNBC anchor,
[03:02:06.058 --> 03:02:15.521]  Joy Reid sued for inciting hate mob against a refugee woman with a media report about the harassment mob formed by someone on their side.
[03:02:15.521 --> 03:02:21.803]  And then I didn't know that Joy Reid put this out against some lady she called racist with no proof.
[03:02:21.803 --> 03:02:22.903]  You are a disgrace.
[03:02:22.903 --> 03:02:27.244]  I wish your children were ripped from you so you would understand the pain.
[03:02:27.244 --> 03:02:29.105]  You are a dirty white woman bitch.
[03:02:30.253 --> 03:02:35.978]  Dear racist bitch, it seems like your old, poor, evil soul never left the Hitler era.
[03:02:35.978 --> 03:02:37.439]  You're funded by Soros.
[03:02:37.439 --> 03:02:43.545]  What a waste, what an embarrassment, what a disgrace of a humankind to have people like you in the world.
[03:02:43.545 --> 03:02:45.246]  Because she doesn't want open borders.
[03:02:45.246 --> 03:02:49.050]  You're the kind of white trash that should be dragged to the town square and flogged.
[03:02:49.050 --> 03:02:50.511]  Well, I'm sure you like Islam then, lady.
[03:02:51.653 --> 03:02:53.514]  Your tongue should be cut out.
[03:02:53.514 --> 03:02:54.275]  Leave this country.
[03:02:54.275 --> 03:02:55.916]  You're an absolute disgrace.
[03:02:55.916 --> 03:03:04.742]  I'm glad everyone in the entire world knows you're a racist piece of, you know what, you effing... And he goes on.
[03:03:04.742 --> 03:03:05.282]  Want out?
[03:03:05.282 --> 03:03:09.445]  Your life is probably becoming a living hell and you don't know how to handle it.
[03:03:09.445 --> 03:03:11.246]  I can offer a way out.
[03:03:11.246 --> 03:03:12.227]  You're a worthless human being.
[03:03:12.227 --> 03:03:13.608]  Go kill yourself.
[03:03:13.608 --> 03:03:20.212]  The best way to make America great again is to tar and feather sluts like you and ride the mount of the country on a rail.
[03:03:20.212 --> 03:03:21.313]  She's still on Twitter, by the way.
[03:03:22.870 --> 03:03:24.811]  It goes on here.
[03:03:24.811 --> 03:03:28.914]  She says, Racist, you know what?
[03:03:28.914 --> 03:03:31.135]  Who the F do you think you are?
[03:03:31.135 --> 03:03:37.379]  You are sick and twisted, females gonna tell you, and you'll end up in hell.
[03:03:37.379 --> 03:03:46.705]  You're a disgusting human being, and if it wasn't for your voicemail being full, you would hear, I can't read any more of this, how she's gonna kill her and everything.
[03:03:46.705 --> 03:03:49.546]  They let the group that attacked Ted Cruz and his wife, who says kill,
[03:03:50.509 --> 03:03:52.831]  The president killed Pence, killed police officers.
[03:03:52.831 --> 03:03:54.592]  They let them operate on Twitter.
[03:03:54.592 --> 03:03:58.295]  But I can't, which is fine.
[03:03:58.295 --> 03:04:18.910]  But Jack Dorsey and all these people are a psychotic cult that are raping the Bill of Rights, raping the Constitution, funding all these radical groups, and of course they've got a pack, a slew, you know, a whole line of women ready to come out and say whatever they want about Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:04:20.700 --> 03:04:30.455]  The truth is, everything they say about Brett Kavanaugh is what Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have been caught involved in, certified, not 35 years ago, but recently.
[03:04:30.455 --> 03:04:33.759]  We'll get Roger Stone's take on, will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed?
[03:04:33.759 --> 03:04:34.440]  I think he will.
[03:04:36.158 --> 03:04:46.722]  And I predicted, you know, like in the Christmas story, that you would have three more accusers after Ford, leading up to the hearings and confirmation.
[03:04:46.722 --> 03:04:49.904]  And I've been proven absolutely untrue.
[03:04:49.904 --> 03:04:50.844]  But now it may be worse.
[03:04:50.844 --> 03:04:52.585]  Maybe five million women will go public.
[03:04:54.389 --> 03:05:01.536]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[03:06:00.616 --> 03:06:08.460]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:06:08.460 --> 03:06:23.728]  Alright, so what you've got is a bunch of appeasers and a bunch of soy beta males running around trying to go find minorities and tell them how much they hate white people and how white people are inherently evil and how Christians are inherently evil and...
[03:06:25.106 --> 03:06:29.893]  I played the clip yesterday of the Democrat Congresswoman saying, man, just shut up.
[03:06:29.893 --> 03:06:30.614]  You're all guilty.
[03:06:30.614 --> 03:06:31.555]  Just shut up.
[03:06:31.555 --> 03:06:36.222]  If a woman accuses you, you're guilty, even if it's 36 years later and all your witnesses say it didn't happen.
[03:06:38.243 --> 03:06:45.488]  And so I was getting into MSNBC anchor Joy Reid, sued for inciting a hate mob, and I was reading quotes of her followers sitting in.
[03:06:45.488 --> 03:06:53.193]  The point she did is, she said the woman had harassed and done all these horrible things to a child and yelled racist things at someone, which wasn't true.
[03:06:53.193 --> 03:06:56.755]  It just shows the insanity of all of this.
[03:06:58.865 --> 03:07:06.995]  There's a lot to get to here today and you've got Michael Avenatti, I always call him Avenatti just to be both joking around.
[03:07:06.995 --> 03:07:13.744]  You've got him now with another woman, you know, saying that Brett Kavanaugh
[03:07:14.881 --> 03:07:24.210]  Ran trains on women, or gangbangs, even though all his friends say he didn't even date girls, was a total bookworm nerd, his calendar shows he wasn't at any of these parties.
[03:07:24.210 --> 03:07:26.272]  They bring out another woman, another woman, another woman.
[03:07:26.272 --> 03:07:29.956]  So the first woman gets discredited, none of the witnesses say it's true, so it's another woman, another woman.
[03:07:29.956 --> 03:07:32.559]  We can see how they smokestream now with a daily one.
[03:07:32.559 --> 03:07:36.002]  I've said three more accusers by the time they have the vote.
[03:07:36.002 --> 03:07:37.403]  Now I've already been proven right today.
[03:07:37.964 --> 03:07:39.065]  It may ruin my record.
[03:07:39.065 --> 03:07:40.746]  I think more will come out.
[03:07:40.746 --> 03:07:45.970]  I mean, hell, they may have a whole sports stadium of 100,000 women all saying he gang raped me.
[03:07:45.970 --> 03:07:49.813]  You know, he abducted me with a flying saucer and took me up and did it.
[03:07:49.813 --> 03:07:51.914]  And we've got to believe it.
[03:07:51.914 --> 03:07:56.558]  So I'm learning how we're all inherently bad, Roger.
[03:07:56.558 --> 03:07:57.879]  But Avenatti, though.
[03:07:59.140 --> 03:08:02.642]  Well Alex, your predictions have turned out to be exactly right.
[03:08:02.642 --> 03:08:07.586]  What's amazing here is, and I've been in American politics for almost 40 years, is this entirely new standard.
[03:08:26.201 --> 03:08:26.341]  Yes.
[03:08:40.888 --> 03:08:46.770]  No eyewitnesses, no corroboration, no evidence, no proof.
[03:08:46.770 --> 03:08:51.391]  Can't say when it happened, where it happened, what year it happened.
[03:08:51.391 --> 03:08:58.773]  But because of identity politics, we're now told that any woman who makes a charge must be believed.
[03:08:59.645 --> 03:09:02.527]  Simply because they're a woman.
[03:09:02.527 --> 03:09:04.348]  This is an absurdity.
[03:09:04.348 --> 03:09:13.454]  Now, Alex, I'm old enough to remember the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings when Clarence Thomas was appointed to the U.S.
[03:09:13.454 --> 03:09:17.316]  Supreme Court by President George H.W.
[03:09:17.316 --> 03:09:18.597]  Bush.
[03:09:18.597 --> 03:09:22.880]  And you had very much the same hysteria around those hearings.
[03:09:23.701 --> 03:09:28.443]  Until Senator Arlen Specter subjected Ms.
[03:09:28.443 --> 03:09:34.246]  Hill to a withering cross-examination in the Senate hearings.
[03:09:34.246 --> 03:09:38.989]  By the way, they still teach that cross-examination in the law schools.
[03:09:38.989 --> 03:09:42.070]  It was so extraordinarily effective.
[03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:53.156]  What happened was, her credibility was shredded, Clarence Thomas was confirmed, and went on to be an outstanding Supreme Court Justice.
[03:09:53.934 --> 03:09:59.239]  Today, the Republicans in the Senate don't seem to have that kind of courage.
[03:09:59.239 --> 03:10:06.085]  They are, as I understand it, going to hide behind a woman prosecutor to do the questioning.
[03:10:07.052 --> 03:10:16.699]  Of a witness who again offers no proof or evidence of her charges other than her recently recovered memory.
[03:10:16.699 --> 03:10:19.681]  Well she says that Kavanaugh didn't even rape her.
[03:10:19.681 --> 03:10:25.885]  She said he was at the thing with the spiking of the punch and then girls had sex so that means gang raping.
[03:10:25.885 --> 03:10:30.148]  Meanwhile everybody else that knows Kavanaugh says dude Mr. Bookworm first in his class
[03:10:31.068 --> 03:10:54.957]  The dude was not at parties, or they were parties, they were like, you read his, it's so sad actually, in a cute way, and I was reading his calendars that he even saved them, and it's like, getting ready for daddy's birthday, and then I've got a study to get an A+, and gee Wilbur, then I'm gonna have some milk toast in the morning, I mean this is just unbelievable, but I guess,
[03:10:55.737 --> 03:11:03.665]  I think a lot of these women actually have probably been abused or something, but they projected that, oh, all men are rapists, so for the greater good, they're going to remember this.
[03:11:03.665 --> 03:11:08.689]  Well, I can remember the Loch Ness Monster raped me, too, 36 years ago.
[03:11:08.689 --> 03:11:12.133]  Well, I think it's extraordinarily transparent.
[03:11:12.133 --> 03:11:19.860]  And then the irony of having Senator Richard Blumenthal on CNN last night with Anderson Cooper.
[03:11:20.629 --> 03:11:23.411]  Essentially calling Judge Kavanaugh a liar.
[03:11:23.411 --> 03:11:31.396]  Richard Blumenthal, a man who indisputably lied about serving in Vietnam, a country he never set foot in.
[03:11:31.396 --> 03:11:35.498]  A man who is a disgrace to the office of the U.S.
[03:11:35.498 --> 03:11:36.399]  Senate.
[03:11:36.399 --> 03:11:43.383]  A man who soils the memory of all those brave men and women who did give their life in that conflict.
[03:11:44.071 --> 03:11:49.697]  And then he has the cojones to sit there with a straight face and call somebody else a liar.
[03:11:49.697 --> 03:11:56.383]  Roger, that's a great argument, but what about funding the Arab Spring that enslaves hundreds of thousands of women and children to sex slavery?
[03:11:56.383 --> 03:12:04.351]  What about the Clintons and all their sex crimes, the Lolita Express and Hillary's chosen job to represent rich pedophiles that rape little girls and she brags
[03:12:04.631 --> 03:12:06.252]  I knew he was guilty, ha ha ha.
[03:12:06.252 --> 03:12:08.193]  He passed a lie detector showing me that didn't work.
[03:12:08.193 --> 03:12:10.054]  I knew he was guilty, ha ha ha.
[03:12:10.054 --> 03:12:14.217]  I mean, and the stealing the Haitian money, and the child running, and just all of it.
[03:12:14.217 --> 03:12:16.238]  And the Vatican, and all the crap.
[03:12:16.238 --> 03:12:20.681]  And then meanwhile, you've got thousands of priests admittedly raping kids in the U.S.
[03:12:20.681 --> 03:12:22.382]  No one gets in trouble.
[03:12:22.382 --> 03:12:26.585]  And they say, oh, statute of limitations, it's only 15 years for child rape in Pennsylvania.
[03:12:27.265 --> 03:12:32.387]  And then meanwhile, 36 years, drunken parties, no proof, and it's the end of the frickin' world!
[03:12:32.387 --> 03:12:36.889]  These people, it'd be like Hitler at Nuremberg, sitting there as the main judge.
[03:12:36.889 --> 03:12:40.010]  It has no credibility because of who they are.
[03:12:41.381 --> 03:12:43.922]  And nobody seems to be willing to say that.
[03:12:43.922 --> 03:12:47.582]  That's the great irony here, Alex.
[03:12:47.582 --> 03:12:49.323]  This is a fraud.
[03:12:49.323 --> 03:13:07.206]  But if this is the new standard, then I have no doubt whatsoever that women are going to come forward shortly and say, although they have no proof, although they have no evidence, although they told no one, although they can't remember where and when it happened, I was sexually assaulted by Cory Booker.
[03:13:07.831 --> 03:13:14.198]  Or I was sexually assaulted by Eric Swalwell.
[03:13:14.198 --> 03:13:15.319]  Should they not be believed?
[03:13:15.319 --> 03:13:18.082]  Should they not be put on CNN to tell their story?
[03:13:18.082 --> 03:13:20.044]  Based on this standard, they should.
[03:13:20.044 --> 03:13:29.795]  What's the difference between such an accuser, and this is hypothetical, but what would be the difference between such an accuser and these women who come forward to malign Judge Kavanaugh?
[03:13:29.895 --> 03:13:32.016]  Well, we're innocent until proven guilty.
[03:13:32.016 --> 03:13:32.956]  We're innocent until proven guilty.
[03:13:32.956 --> 03:13:35.157]  Let's play a few minutes of Clarence Thomas as we go to break.
[03:13:35.157 --> 03:13:41.600]  We're coming up with the President to talk about this being a con game, but here's a few minutes of Clarence Thomas.
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:54.846]  Senator, I would like to start by saying unequivocally, uncategorically, that I deny each and every single allegation against me today that suggested in any way
[03:13:56.343 --> 03:14:05.767]  That I had conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with Anita Hill.
[03:14:05.767 --> 03:14:09.189]  That I ever attempted to date her.
[03:14:09.189 --> 03:14:15.292]  That I ever had any personal sexual interest in her.
[03:14:15.292 --> 03:14:18.073]  Or that I, in any way, ever harassed her.
[03:14:19.966 --> 03:14:23.549]  A second and I think more important point.
[03:14:23.549 --> 03:14:29.113]  I think that this today is a travesty.
[03:14:29.113 --> 03:14:31.775]  I think that it is disgusting.
[03:14:31.775 --> 03:14:40.021]  I think that this hearing should never occur in America.
[03:14:40.021 --> 03:14:49.569]  This is a case in which this sleaze, this dirt, was searched for by staffers of members of this committee.
[03:14:52.352 --> 03:15:09.016]  Was then leaked to the media, and this committee and this body validated it and displayed it at prime time over our entire nation.
[03:15:09.016 --> 03:15:21.459]  How would any member on this committee, any person in this room, or any person in this country, would like sleaze said about him or her?
[03:15:22.529 --> 03:15:25.411]  Well, people smell the truth, don't they?
[03:15:25.411 --> 03:15:27.372]  Clarence Thomas didn't do a damn thing!
[03:15:53.308 --> 03:15:55.169]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:15:55.169 --> 03:16:03.773]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:17:38.462 --> 03:17:43.664]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[03:17:43.664 --> 03:17:46.666]  You can easily find Sunny Bay Heating Pads on Amazon.
[03:17:46.666 --> 03:17:54.189]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:54.189 --> 03:17:58.031]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:17:59.423 --> 03:18:08.126]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:18:08.126 --> 03:18:10.087]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:18:10.087 --> 03:18:13.548]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:18:13.548 --> 03:18:16.169]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:18:16.169 --> 03:18:18.450]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:18:18.450 --> 03:18:25.413]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:18:25.953 --> 03:18:35.738]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:18:35.738 --> 03:18:36.938]  We'll win.
[03:18:36.938 --> 03:18:39.840]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:46.983]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:18:46.983 --> 03:18:50.685]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globals may win.
[03:18:50.685 --> 03:18:52.245]  This is InfoWars' Darkness Howard.
[03:18:52.245 --> 03:18:52.926]  We need your support.
[03:18:52.926 --> 03:18:53.646]  I'm counting on you.
[03:18:54.006 --> 03:19:02.393]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.393 --> 03:19:03.855]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:03.855 --> 03:19:08.559]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.559 --> 03:19:13.563]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:19:13.783 --> 03:19:33.929]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.449 --> 03:19:38.453]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:19:38.453 --> 03:19:42.116]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:19:42.116 --> 03:19:47.100]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:19:47.100 --> 03:19:49.842]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:19:49.842 --> 03:19:57.148]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:57.148 --> 03:19:59.770]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.553 --> 03:20:20.178]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.178 --> 03:20:25.402]  And Roger Stone riding shotgun with me in the middle of this special 16 hour global broadcast.
[03:20:25.402 --> 03:20:28.024]  Goes till midnight tonight.
[03:20:28.024 --> 03:20:32.227]  The fall of Venezuela has already happened, but the official fall is nigh.
[03:20:33.357 --> 03:20:37.878]  And Trump is weighing military intervention and getting South American backers.
[03:20:37.878 --> 03:20:43.279]  And I don't like military intervention, but this could collapse like dominoes.
[03:20:43.279 --> 03:20:44.799]  Like I need a set of dominoes in here.
[03:20:44.799 --> 03:20:51.301]  We need to buy some to explain that Venezuela is just like seven or eight countries down.
[03:20:51.301 --> 03:20:52.421]  Right to us.
[03:20:52.421 --> 03:20:54.501]  They've already, millions are exiting.
[03:20:54.501 --> 03:20:56.662]  It's a total collapse.
[03:20:56.662 --> 03:21:01.563]  And I think Alexandra Cortez should run down there because she says that's the model.
[03:21:02.964 --> 03:21:07.670]  And it's so beautiful, so wonderful how communism works.
[03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:08.651]  Going back to Roger Stone.
[03:21:08.651 --> 03:21:15.399]  Roger, you know the President well, and I just think suddenly he has more energy, he's more aggressive, he's more impromptu, he's on fire.
[03:21:15.399 --> 03:21:19.304]  We're going to play part of a five minute clip where he talks about the con game of going after Kavanaugh.
[03:21:20.385 --> 03:21:27.994]  To me, and him saying declassify stuff, they're trying to block it, but now Rosenstein's saying he resigned, and he didn't, tomorrow.
[03:21:27.994 --> 03:21:37.525]  Seems like so much is happening this Thursday, and I just smell, and I see, and I get the signal that more and more Trump's doing what he wants to do, and that is scaring the living hell out of the globalists.
[03:21:39.380 --> 03:21:40.361]  I completely agree.
[03:21:40.361 --> 03:21:44.483]  The president seems to have a new bounce in his step.
[03:21:44.483 --> 03:21:48.726]  And the breaking news is all breaking his way.
[03:21:48.726 --> 03:22:03.516]  It's amazing how quickly those in the deep state rushed to dissuade him from declassifying the material surrounding the FISA warrants that were used to unconstitutionally spy on the president's campaign.
[03:22:03.516 --> 03:22:04.917]  That's right, Mr. President.
[03:22:04.917 --> 03:22:06.898]  It's time for sunshine.
[03:22:06.898 --> 03:22:09.120]  Sunshine is the disinfectant.
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:19.862]  These characters are so shady that they get the British to contact the President and say, Oh, Mr. President, you can't declassify this material.
[03:22:19.862 --> 03:22:24.404]  It would harm your national security and our international relationships.
[03:22:24.404 --> 03:22:30.765]  No, Mr. President, it'll prove that the British were spying on you at the behest of the Obama administration.
[03:22:31.085 --> 03:22:34.370]  Which you first broke, and Napolitano and I, we all broke it.
[03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:36.333]  And people go, that sounds crazy, why would a foreign power?
[03:22:36.333 --> 03:22:39.458]  Because we spying on the Brits illegally, they spying on us illegally.
[03:22:39.458 --> 03:22:40.380]  The Brits kill U.S.
[03:22:40.380 --> 03:22:42.122]  citizens, we kill their citizens.
[03:22:42.122 --> 03:22:45.648]  That's well-known spycraft with the special relationship.
[03:22:47.112 --> 03:22:48.232]  That's exactly right.
[03:22:48.232 --> 03:22:53.634]  Also, Alex, I want to remind people tonight about our global marathon.
[03:22:53.634 --> 03:22:55.895]  We're going to be on right up until midnight.
[03:22:55.895 --> 03:22:57.756]  I'm going to be there doing my part.
[03:22:57.756 --> 03:23:03.998]  This is going to be very exciting as we continue to sound the clarion call for freedom because there's a lot of good news.
[03:23:04.478 --> 03:23:15.647]  We now know, for example, according to the New York Post, that the president has an executive order demanding an investigation on the basis of antitrust into Facebook and Google.
[03:23:15.647 --> 03:23:25.995]  And quite obviously, InfoWars is in the forefront of those conservative news outlets that are being shadowed and banned, wiped off the face of the earth.
[03:23:26.255 --> 03:23:31.907]  I had law firms six weeks ago send those reports to the president through intermediaries.
[03:23:31.907 --> 03:23:32.969]  That's one reason we were banned.
[03:23:32.969 --> 03:23:34.533]  So next month's news today.
[03:23:34.533 --> 03:23:34.853]  Continue.
[03:23:36.448 --> 03:23:40.291]  This is, I think, the most important fight on the horizon.
[03:23:40.291 --> 03:23:46.234]  If there is no InfoWars, then there is no one to sound the clarion call for freedom.
[03:23:46.234 --> 03:23:57.620]  There is no one to put into perspective for people, for example, that the accusers of Brett Kavanaugh have no evidence, have no eyewitnesses, have no corroboration.
[03:23:57.620 --> 03:23:58.261]  Can't remember
[03:23:59.421 --> 03:24:04.144]  Roger, if you said that I raped you 36 years ago with no proof, they'd laugh at you because we're men.
[03:24:04.144 --> 03:24:07.165]  Or if I said that, it's preposterous.
[03:24:07.165 --> 03:24:09.487]  Kavanaugh was a bookworm nerd.
[03:24:09.487 --> 03:24:13.329]  I mean, he has all the real witnesses.
[03:24:13.329 --> 03:24:17.931]  Everything they've done has fallen apart, but they keep leapfrogging to the next pile of crap.
[03:24:18.905 --> 03:24:35.297]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary because the politically correct nature of this Me Too movement means that if you're a woman, regardless of your lack of any evidence or proof, you must automatically be believed.
[03:24:35.297 --> 03:24:37.799]  That sets a dangerous new standard.
[03:24:37.799 --> 03:24:45.544]  And I know a number of Democrats who could be subjected to the same exact type of accusations.
[03:24:45.544 --> 03:24:46.225]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:24:49.500 --> 03:24:59.006]  I think they've crossed the Rubicon, and a lot of people are seeing this, where the Republicans are, we don't care if you have 100 women, we can see the bandwagon, gang up effect, it was easy to predict.
[03:24:59.006 --> 03:25:01.568]  We're done, this is a load of crap, we're going to confirm him Friday.
[03:25:01.568 --> 03:25:14.416]  I mean, I think the Me Too thing has finally played out, especially when it's led by the famous lawyer of pedophiles, Hillary, and her big, ugly, pedophile, crooked Johnson husband.
[03:25:16.437 --> 03:25:21.539]  Yeah, even the Democrats at this point probably wish that Hillary would just go away.
[03:25:21.539 --> 03:25:27.982]  The idea of Hillary Clinton coming out and saying, well, these women should be believed is ludicrous.
[03:25:27.982 --> 03:25:29.543]  What about Kathleen Willey?
[03:25:29.543 --> 03:25:31.364]  What about Juanita Broderick?
[03:25:31.364 --> 03:25:33.745]  What about Paula Jones?
[03:25:33.745 --> 03:25:37.707]  What about the numerous women sexually assaulted, bitten,
[03:25:38.699 --> 03:25:40.120]  Uh, raped.
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:44.302]  Uh, having him expose himself to these women.
[03:25:44.302 --> 03:25:54.188]  And that's why I said that he has a crooked male genitals, is that the women before it was ever in the news said, it literally turns and points straight down towards hell, his father.
[03:25:54.188 --> 03:25:58.210]  So, Bill Clinton has a very large male genitals and they literally is deformed.
[03:25:58.210 --> 03:26:01.552]  I mean, he has a crooked, broken, that's how the women know.
[03:26:02.406 --> 03:26:09.698]  Yeah, the only thing I disagree about is I was under the impression from interviewing a number of his women victims that it was actually abnormally small.
[03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:13.611]  Yes.
[03:26:13.611 --> 03:26:25.941]  But you can go to the Clinton's War on Women, which is available at the Infowars.com store right now, to get the definitive story on Bill Clinton's serial sexual assaults against dozens of women.
[03:26:25.941 --> 03:26:37.972]  And more importantly, the role that Hillary plays in hiring the nasty private detectives and the vicious lawyers to bludgeon these women, to intimidate them, to bully them into silence.
[03:26:37.972 --> 03:26:40.434]  Let's be clear, some people got beaten half to death.
[03:26:41.778 --> 03:26:43.921]  There is no question.
[03:26:43.921 --> 03:26:49.247]  One witness was beaten so badly that even today he fears for his life.
[03:26:53.649 --> 03:27:00.056]  Yes, and the Jennifer Flowers relationship was actually a consensual relationship.
[03:27:00.056 --> 03:27:11.788]  This poor bastard's problem is that he made the mistake of setting up a security camera in the hallway because somebody had been vandalizing his automobile and what he caught was Bill Clinton coming and going.
[03:27:12.308 --> 03:27:21.311]  Then one day, three Arkansas State Troopers showed up and they beat this man so badly that they left him for dead.
[03:27:21.311 --> 03:27:23.352]  Fortunately, he survived.
[03:27:23.352 --> 03:27:34.215]  It's all there in the Clinton's War on Women, available at the Infowars.com store right now at a terrific price of $9.95, which is much less than you can buy it anywhere else.
[03:27:34.215 --> 03:27:35.736]  And folks, I know you already know all this.
[03:27:35.976 --> 03:27:39.017]  Get the book and give it to the library after you read it.
[03:27:39.017 --> 03:27:41.397]  This is how we win the war, about 100 people read it.
[03:27:41.397 --> 03:27:43.038]  That's how we win, one mind at a time.
[03:27:43.038 --> 03:27:44.318]  We'll go to break, come back with Roger Stone.
[03:27:44.318 --> 03:27:49.840]  I'm gonna play some of Trump eloquently exposing this whole Kavanaugh situation.
[03:27:49.840 --> 03:27:55.221]  But listen, everything's game-changing at m4warstore.com.
[03:27:55.221 --> 03:28:01.843]  So yes, I don't keep extending for three, four days the sale on X2 because, you know, it's just, oh, it's our last day, it's our last day.
[03:28:01.843 --> 03:28:03.103]  I have been so busy on air.
[03:28:04.469 --> 03:28:11.282]  And so busy, like a one-legged man in a you-know-what contest, that I have just not launched all the other big specials that we will launch tomorrow.
[03:28:11.282 --> 03:28:12.385]  They were meant to be launched today.
[03:28:13.604 --> 03:28:15.365]  This is the last day to get X2.
[03:28:15.365 --> 03:28:16.626]  I've got to go do the specials right now.
[03:28:16.626 --> 03:28:20.009]  I'm going to shoot some ads for the new t-shirts too, so you'll see it all tomorrow.
[03:28:20.009 --> 03:28:27.014]  But part of the new specials that they did get out, because I said this last week to the crew, was 40% off Brain Force Plus, great deal.
[03:28:27.014 --> 03:28:31.117]  40% off Secret 12, InfoWarsStore.com is the main site.
[03:28:31.117 --> 03:28:34.039]  InfoWarsLife.com is the supplements.
[03:28:34.039 --> 03:28:37.942]  40% off, 50% off SuperMetal Vitality, this is the last run of that.
[03:28:37.942 --> 03:28:38.642]  BioDrus Selenium, 40% off.
[03:28:40.143 --> 03:28:46.433]  Sign up for AutoShip, and yeah, even if the X2 sells out, we're gonna hold back for one more shipment.
[03:28:46.433 --> 03:28:48.897]  Whoever signed up for AutoShip, you'll get an additional 10% off.
[03:28:48.897 --> 03:28:52.083]  So that's one way to make sure you get the next run of X2 as well.
[03:28:53.305 --> 03:28:54.526]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:28:54.526 --> 03:28:58.447]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:28:58.447 --> 03:28:59.988]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:28:59.988 --> 03:29:02.950]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:29:02.950 --> 03:29:08.512]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:29:08.512 --> 03:29:09.713]  I can help you, too.
[03:29:09.713 --> 03:29:12.654]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[03:31:53.752 --> 03:31:57.713]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.713 --> 03:32:00.994]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:00.994 --> 03:32:07.256]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.256 --> 03:32:10.037]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:10.777 --> 03:32:14.599]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.599 --> 03:32:21.062]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.062 --> 03:32:26.024]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.775 --> 03:32:30.697]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:30.697 --> 03:32:37.901]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:37.901 --> 03:32:43.044]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.044 --> 03:32:48.827]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:48.827 --> 03:32:52.789]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.074 --> 03:33:06.781]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.781 --> 03:33:09.483]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:09.483 --> 03:33:16.948]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:33:16.948 --> 03:33:22.312]  Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field and deploy the fleet so no one gets off the system.
[03:33:23.712 --> 03:33:28.615]  That's what the globalists want for America, but humanity is awakening.
[03:33:28.615 --> 03:33:30.936]  This is InfoWars.
[03:33:30.936 --> 03:33:33.217]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[03:33:33.217 --> 03:33:37.999]  Well, Bloomberg has to admit Trump is right a year later.
[03:33:37.999 --> 03:33:40.341]  We don't want to invade Venezuela, but I meant...
[03:33:41.417 --> 03:33:44.620]  When I said it, that it's collapsing in a domino effect.
[03:33:44.620 --> 03:33:49.764]  And my memory did serve that Venezuela is seven countries south of us.
[03:33:49.764 --> 03:33:56.930]  Can we go to the Geospatial Center, also known as Google, and the CIA map, please?
[03:33:56.930 --> 03:33:57.750]  And there it is.
[03:33:57.750 --> 03:34:00.393]  Let's zoom in on the CIA map.
[03:34:00.393 --> 03:34:09.120]  There you see Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and then Venezuela.
[03:34:10.250 --> 03:34:12.472]  There's seven countries south of us.
[03:34:12.472 --> 03:34:15.355]  Five million people the last month have left.
[03:34:15.355 --> 03:34:16.796]  Tens of millions more are trying to leave.
[03:34:16.796 --> 03:34:24.303]  They put up emergency fences in Colombia and in other surrounding countries like Brazil.
[03:34:24.303 --> 03:34:32.851]  Even leftist governments have declared civil emergencies because people are fleeing what Alexander Cortez would have for America, communism.
[03:34:35.376 --> 03:34:41.982]  Here is Trump's Venezuela military option gains backers as millions flee.
[03:34:41.982 --> 03:34:48.308]  When President Donald Trump said a year ago, just like they're fleeing California, when President Donald Trump said a year ago the U.S.
[03:34:48.308 --> 03:34:49.890]  was considering a military option,
[03:34:51.445 --> 03:34:55.086]  For Venezuela, hardly anyone in Washington thought it was a good idea.
[03:34:55.086 --> 03:34:58.487]  Again, I don't want military options, but it is a national security issue.
[03:34:58.487 --> 03:35:04.408]  Because Mexico and others have opened up a conduit, a corridor, for anybody that wants to come up from South America.
[03:35:04.408 --> 03:35:17.792]  Today, as Venezuela slides towards dictatorship, they've been a dictatorship for 15 years, and collapse, already collapsed, triggering a million strong migration crisis, which Soros is already in
[03:35:19.065 --> 03:35:20.606]  Countries north of that setting up.
[03:35:20.606 --> 03:35:23.207]  Support for such a move is being discussed openly.
[03:35:23.207 --> 03:35:33.193]  The notion of using force to topple the government of President Nicolás Maduro is gaining adherence, although it remains a distinctly minority view.
[03:35:33.193 --> 03:35:36.015]  Now, I just say seal that border with the U.S.
[03:35:36.015 --> 03:35:36.495]  military.
[03:35:36.495 --> 03:35:37.556]  The wall's not even needed.
[03:35:37.556 --> 03:35:39.397]  Put 100,000 troops on the border.
[03:35:39.397 --> 03:35:40.998]  That should do it.
[03:35:40.998 --> 03:35:45.361]  And just let the heaven of Latin America descend into hell.
[03:35:46.221 --> 03:35:54.004]  Because everyone wants to get up here and then say George Washington and America sucks and piss on everything and run around bitching.
[03:35:54.004 --> 03:36:01.807]  I think Californians and all the socialists should just run down there to Venezuela and just bash in your heaven.
[03:36:01.807 --> 03:36:03.608]  Or go to China where there's no welfare.
[03:36:03.608 --> 03:36:04.468]  Criticize the police.
[03:36:04.468 --> 03:36:06.269]  They cut your genitals off and murder you.
[03:36:06.269 --> 03:36:08.110]  Go work at an apple slave plant.
[03:36:08.110 --> 03:36:11.231]  It's okay because Tim Cook's gay.
[03:36:11.231 --> 03:36:12.611]  I murder everyone.
[03:36:12.611 --> 03:36:13.092]  I'm liberal.
[03:36:14.192 --> 03:36:16.353]  You know, I help censor everyone.
[03:36:16.353 --> 03:36:17.754]  That's what they're doing here.
[03:36:17.754 --> 03:36:20.776]  A little uncouth when I do that, but it's okay.
[03:36:20.776 --> 03:36:27.601]  Jack Pasovic, I was doing that on the street in D.C., in front of news cameras, and he was just going like, yeah, at a certain point, I don't care, okay?
[03:36:27.601 --> 03:36:29.002]  I'm having some fun here.
[03:36:29.002 --> 03:36:33.345]  But it's just like Tim Cook said, I can kill whoever I want at slave factories.
[03:36:33.345 --> 03:36:33.865]  I'm gay.
[03:36:33.865 --> 03:36:35.046]  It's liberal.
[03:36:35.046 --> 03:36:36.307]  I can censor whoever I want.
[03:36:36.307 --> 03:36:36.767]  It's gay.
[03:36:36.767 --> 03:36:37.248]  It's liberal.
[03:36:38.387 --> 03:36:40.067]  We're like, well, you're gay, so it's okay.
[03:36:40.067 --> 03:36:42.268]  If Hitler would have said he was gay, Tim Cook would be like, I'm Hitler!
[03:36:42.268 --> 03:36:44.928]  I'd be like, oh my God, Hitler's so cool!
[03:36:44.928 --> 03:36:49.829]  Anyways, sorry, I'm getting a little bit too much into it.
[03:36:49.829 --> 03:36:51.210]  There he is.
[03:36:51.210 --> 03:36:55.871]  Going back to Roger Stone, I mean, what do you make of the situation in Venezuela, Roger?
[03:36:55.871 --> 03:36:59.672]  You know, wait a minute, this is a socialist utopia.
[03:36:59.672 --> 03:37:05.673]  We were told that this was heaven on earth, that their system was so far superior to ours.
[03:37:06.354 --> 03:37:11.576]  People, there are no dogs left because people have hunted them all down to kill them for food.
[03:37:11.576 --> 03:37:15.697]  People are eating grass because they can't find anything to eat.
[03:37:15.697 --> 03:37:18.038]  No, it's an international emergency.
[03:37:18.038 --> 03:37:22.319]  And Donald Trump, in my opinion, has the courage to take a stand.
[03:37:22.959 --> 03:37:29.964]  And by the way, Venezuela used to be as rich as Argentina, like a hundred years ago, richer than the U.S., 50 years ago as rich.
[03:37:29.964 --> 03:37:37.969]  They're diamonds, rubies, gold, timber, oil, it's a frickin' paradise of resources!
[03:37:37.969 --> 03:37:44.814]  Yeah, there is no reason for the current situation, given their riches, particularly in the terms of petroleum.
[03:37:45.439 --> 03:37:48.961]  But this is what communism gets you.
[03:37:48.961 --> 03:38:02.329]  Alex, speaking of food, I do have to mention to you that on Monday night, I was invited out to dinner by a New York Times reporter, and he said that it was on him, which meant it was on Carlos Slim.
[03:38:02.329 --> 03:38:13.675]  And therefore, I took him to the finest steakhouse in all of South Florida, where I knew they had an incredible 48-ounce porterhouse that is just a thing to behold.
[03:38:13.675 --> 03:38:14.396]  Okay, I'm getting hungry.
[03:38:15.305 --> 03:38:16.906]  And therefore, I ordered it.
[03:38:16.906 --> 03:38:19.188]  And I must tell you, I enjoyed every bite.
[03:38:19.188 --> 03:38:22.890]  But afterwards, it was really debilitating.
[03:38:22.890 --> 03:38:29.934]  And then I remembered, I had ordered a bottle of Carnivore from the InfoWars.com store.
[03:38:29.934 --> 03:38:35.198]  Let me tell you, this is now my new favorite product next to Brain Force Plus.
[03:38:36.299 --> 03:38:41.685]  You don't have the situation where this just sits in your gut and ferments.
[03:38:41.685 --> 03:38:46.129]  The enzymes that are used in carnivore help you to gently digest.
[03:38:46.129 --> 03:38:49.873]  You don't end up like John Wayne with 45 pounds of undigested Hillary Clinton in your guts.
[03:38:50.706 --> 03:38:52.446]  I mean, it's exactly right.
[03:38:52.446 --> 03:38:59.088]  In this case, my digestive dis-ease disappeared like that.
[03:38:59.088 --> 03:39:01.308]  This is a truly great product.
[03:39:01.308 --> 03:39:07.210]  And right now, $23.42 on a special price, worth every penny of it.
[03:39:07.210 --> 03:39:17.052]  So the next time you're going to gouge Carlos Slim and hand him a restaurant bill of a couple hundred bucks for some of the finest beef in the United States,
[03:39:17.652 --> 03:39:20.314]  Make sure you've got your bottle of carnivore first.
[03:39:20.314 --> 03:39:21.195]  Why do you say beef?
[03:39:21.195 --> 03:39:22.236]  I'm getting really hungry here.
[03:39:22.236 --> 03:39:24.077]  What's the name of the steakhouse?
[03:39:24.077 --> 03:39:27.160]  It was called Mastro's Ocean House.
[03:39:27.160 --> 03:39:28.621]  This is a new place.
[03:39:28.621 --> 03:39:30.883]  It's just opened in South Florida.
[03:39:30.883 --> 03:39:32.584]  I know there's one in New York City.
[03:39:32.584 --> 03:39:34.946]  I know there's one in Washington, D.C.
[03:39:34.946 --> 03:39:40.671]  I must tell you, it was outstanding, but the best thing about it, it was being paid for by the New York Stock Exchange.
[03:39:40.671 --> 03:39:44.534]  Well, there's nothing better than a glass of red wine, a big ol' juicy porterhouse and potatoes gratin.
[03:39:45.074 --> 03:39:45.876]  And some asparagus.
[03:39:45.876 --> 03:39:47.920]  But like I said, I gotta get a driver when I do that.
[03:39:47.920 --> 03:39:49.484]  I actually will Uber or whatever.
[03:39:49.484 --> 03:39:52.691]  Because when I get home, it's like BOOM!
[03:39:52.691 --> 03:39:54.935]  We're talking sleep for 12 hours when I hit a porterhouse.
[03:39:55.919 --> 03:40:01.762]  Yeah, it's called the food coma, but you can avoid the negative effects with carnivore.
[03:40:01.762 --> 03:40:07.045]  So this is, you can now add another satisfied... But you know what Bernie Sanders said?
[03:40:07.045 --> 03:40:15.969]  He said, when I go to the store, hundreds of different vitamins, 30 different deodorants, I don't need it.
[03:40:15.969 --> 03:40:18.451]  Too much freedom, too much diversity.
[03:40:19.091 --> 03:40:25.834]  Now, I never found a university, I didn't swindle, and I have three $1 million homes.
[03:40:25.834 --> 03:40:29.636]  And they called for me to be banned on Twitter, Alex Jones, because he criticized me.
[03:40:29.636 --> 03:40:35.999]  But when we get in people's faces, when the Antifa does and says they're going to kill you, then it's okay.
[03:40:35.999 --> 03:40:38.381]  So, let me ask you now.
[03:40:38.381 --> 03:40:42.983]  What do you think is going to happen with President Trump in the next 40 days, Roger?
[03:40:44.335 --> 03:41:00.864]  Well, Alex, this meeting that he has with Rod Rosenstein, the rogue Deputy Attorney General who most definitely has been exposed for proposing to wear a wire in order to entrap the President of the United States to remove him under the
[03:41:01.324 --> 03:41:02.945]  25th Amendment.
[03:41:02.945 --> 03:41:03.906]  Remember that, folks.
[03:41:03.906 --> 03:41:06.848]  You heard it here at InfoWars First.
[03:41:06.848 --> 03:41:07.828]  It was not a joke.
[03:41:07.828 --> 03:41:09.789]  He was not joking.
[03:41:09.789 --> 03:41:14.792]  The New York Times story makes it clear that several of their sources asked, is this a joke?
[03:41:14.792 --> 03:41:17.074]  Andrew McCabe asked him, are you joking?
[03:41:17.074 --> 03:41:20.196]  Sure, so what happens to Marta Ratstein?
[03:41:20.196 --> 03:41:21.457]  Well, that's an excellent question.
[03:41:21.457 --> 03:41:23.338]  There are three possibilities.
[03:41:23.338 --> 03:41:25.359]  One, he resigns.
[03:41:25.359 --> 03:41:26.760]  Two, he is fired.
[03:41:27.389 --> 03:41:30.911]  I mean, Rosenstein literally looks like one of those ventriloquist dolls.
[03:41:30.911 --> 03:41:31.771]  You've got the backstory on him.
[03:41:31.771 --> 03:41:33.812]  Like, I heard he, like, covered up for the mafia.
[03:41:33.812 --> 03:41:35.072]  He's really corrupt.
[03:41:52.014 --> 03:42:00.097]  Yeah, look, his appointment is due to Reince Priebus, the President's first White House Chief of Staff.
[03:42:00.097 --> 03:42:08.881]  Why you would appoint James Comey and Robert Mueller's best friend as your Deputy Attorney General is beyond me.
[03:42:08.881 --> 03:42:11.722]  This guy is a charter member of the swamp.
[03:42:12.296 --> 03:42:15.339]  He is a swamp creature through and through.
[03:42:15.339 --> 03:42:19.623]  He has stonewalled the Congress in their efforts to get at... Let me just be honest.
[03:42:19.623 --> 03:42:21.024]  I'm going to come out with it here.
[03:42:21.024 --> 03:42:28.251]  He gang raped me along with Comey and Mueller a few years ago, 37 years ago, and they got me drunk on punch.
[03:42:28.251 --> 03:42:29.412]  You need to believe any accused.
[03:42:29.412 --> 03:42:32.094]  So he has to step down now.
[03:42:32.094 --> 03:42:33.255]  Rosenstein raped me.
[03:42:34.161 --> 03:42:37.083]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:42:58.365 --> 03:43:07.073]  Infowars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:43:07.073 --> 03:43:09.035]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:43:09.035 --> 03:43:12.498]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:43:12.498 --> 03:43:15.121]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:43:15.121 --> 03:43:17.403]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:43:17.403 --> 03:43:20.045]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is,
[03:43:20.726 --> 03:43:24.935]  And understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target.
[03:43:24.935 --> 03:43:29.826]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[03:43:30.976 --> 03:43:34.698]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:43:34.698 --> 03:43:35.858]  We'll win.
[03:43:35.858 --> 03:43:38.699]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[03:43:38.699 --> 03:43:44.081]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[03:43:44.081 --> 03:43:45.922]  And you're right, to the market.
[03:43:45.922 --> 03:43:49.624]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:43:49.624 --> 03:43:51.184]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.

[03:43:53.083 --> 03:43:55.444]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:43:55.444 --> 03:44:02.028]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[03:44:53.655 --> 03:45:02.179]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.179 --> 03:45:03.640]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:03.640 --> 03:45:08.342]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:45:08.342 --> 03:45:11.424]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:45:11.904 --> 03:45:13.586]  I still have that energy.
[03:45:13.586 --> 03:45:33.742]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:45:34.242 --> 03:45:38.226]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:45:38.226 --> 03:45:41.909]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:45:41.909 --> 03:45:46.893]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:45:46.893 --> 03:45:49.635]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:45:49.635 --> 03:45:51.036]  Supermail Vitality.
[03:45:51.036 --> 03:45:52.077]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:54.514 --> 03:45:57.517]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[03:45:57.517 --> 03:46:00.099]  And Survival Philodex II is the pure iodine.
[03:46:00.099 --> 03:46:00.979]  No one else has this.
[03:46:00.979 --> 03:46:04.042]  From deep earth, crystals between 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[03:46:04.042 --> 03:46:05.523]  It's very hard for me to get.
[03:46:05.523 --> 03:46:07.445]  It's the good halogen.
[03:46:07.445 --> 03:46:09.547]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[03:46:09.547 --> 03:46:16.092]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[03:46:16.092 --> 03:46:18.694]  Bio-Truth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[03:46:18.694 --> 03:46:20.095]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[03:46:21.397 --> 03:46:27.122]  It's the, as well, in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[03:46:27.122 --> 03:46:28.923]  So these go incredibly well together.
[03:46:28.923 --> 03:46:30.485]  We have a combo of those.
[03:46:30.485 --> 03:46:31.866]  Just experience it for yourself.
[03:46:31.866 --> 03:46:34.588]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[03:46:34.588 --> 03:46:35.629]  Very simple stuff.
[03:46:35.629 --> 03:46:37.250]  Filter your water.
[03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:39.352]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[03:46:39.352 --> 03:46:40.814]  Best out there for the price.
[03:46:40.814 --> 03:46:41.895]  When I say it's the last run,
[03:46:43.092 --> 03:46:44.693]  I think it'll be six bucks a year until we get more.
[03:46:44.693 --> 03:46:45.513]  I hope we get more.
[03:46:45.513 --> 03:46:46.834]  This is the last run it looks like.
[03:46:46.834 --> 03:46:47.554]  Survival Short X2.
[03:46:47.554 --> 03:46:49.415]  InfoWarsTour.com or InfoWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[03:46:49.415 --> 03:46:51.536]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:12.890 --> 03:47:14.351]  Hi, Roger Stones here hosting with me.
[03:47:14.351 --> 03:47:15.191]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:15.191 --> 03:47:17.632]  Part of this broadcast goes all the way to midnight tonight.
[03:47:17.632 --> 03:47:18.152]  Stand with Trump.
[03:47:18.152 --> 03:47:19.253]  Stand with him for wars.
[03:47:19.253 --> 03:47:23.255]  Stand with America and the recovery.
[03:47:23.255 --> 03:47:24.355]  Oh, you're anti-government?
[03:47:24.355 --> 03:47:25.356]  Yeah, I was anti-globalist.
[03:47:25.356 --> 03:47:27.677]  Once we get our government back, I'm pro-Constitution.
[03:47:27.677 --> 03:47:30.278]  I mean, my God, we're all being persecuted for this.
[03:47:30.278 --> 03:47:36.721]  So, Pigelstein, Ratstein, whatever you want to call him, they crapped their britches a week ago when Trump said he'd release it.
[03:47:36.721 --> 03:47:39.162]  Then they said, oh, have the Inspector General
[03:47:41.082 --> 03:47:41.482]  I don't
[03:47:53.669 --> 03:47:54.709]  Elected.
[03:47:54.709 --> 03:47:56.710]  You said, look out.
[03:47:56.710 --> 03:47:58.050]  They've used illegal spying.
[03:47:58.050 --> 03:47:59.551]  They've done all this.
[03:47:59.551 --> 03:48:00.491]  You've been proven right.
[03:48:00.491 --> 03:48:02.292]  Release the secret documents.
[03:48:02.292 --> 03:48:06.013]  All it is, is their criminal operation reporting back to Hillary.
[03:48:06.013 --> 03:48:07.133]  We already know what's in it.
[03:48:07.133 --> 03:48:08.494]  It's already in the WikiLeaks.
[03:48:08.494 --> 03:48:13.495]  I mean, this is... Why isn't the Death Star firing weapons now?
[03:48:13.495 --> 03:48:15.796]  He needs to destroy them now.
[03:48:17.631 --> 03:48:32.544]  Because some of his timid advisors are taking the ridiculous position that declassifying these documents will somehow expose their sources and methods and threaten the national security.
[03:48:32.544 --> 03:48:35.546]  It was Hillary's secret server did that to the whole world.
[03:48:35.546 --> 03:48:37.908]  They're the globalists selling out America.
[03:48:37.908 --> 03:48:39.429]  The personnel management hack.
[03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.970]  Exactly!
[03:48:41.096 --> 03:48:55.874]  What declassification these documents will prove is that the Obama Justice Department and the Obama FBI used unconstitutional surveillance of the Trump campaign to first try to prevent his election and now try to negate his election.
[03:48:55.874 --> 03:48:59.078]  And by the way, hasn't Obama looked like he's crapping bricks lately?
[03:49:00.433 --> 03:49:03.335]  Well, because this is where it all leads to.
[03:49:03.335 --> 03:49:05.937]  What did the President know and when did he know it?
[03:49:05.937 --> 03:49:09.719]  When will President Trump order Barack Obama's arrest?
[03:49:09.719 --> 03:49:11.561]  That's the only question.
[03:49:11.561 --> 03:49:14.863]  Well, sure, victory is pulling the lever.
[03:49:14.863 --> 03:49:17.965]  They only take his restraint and his détente, his weakness.
[03:49:17.965 --> 03:49:20.487]  He needs to pull the lever now.
[03:49:20.487 --> 03:49:23.349]  He needs to say, fire at will, Commander.
[03:49:24.341 --> 03:49:25.402]  No question about it.
[03:49:25.402 --> 03:49:31.287]  That's precisely what I have written and said today, and it's what he needs to do.
[03:49:31.287 --> 03:49:33.649]  Do not be deterred by these quizlings.
[03:49:33.649 --> 03:49:39.054]  And notice, that's why they hate you and I and others, because we say attack, attack, attack, because we're in the right.
[03:49:39.054 --> 03:49:40.995]  We have victory within sight.
[03:49:40.995 --> 03:49:43.217]  We have them dead in the crosshairs politically.
[03:49:43.217 --> 03:49:44.458]  FIRE!
[03:49:44.458 --> 03:49:45.379]  FIRE!
[03:49:45.379 --> 03:49:46.460]  YES!
[03:49:46.460 --> 03:49:49.122]  Plus, it's what people want!
[03:49:49.122 --> 03:49:50.704]  And therefore, their response is,
[03:49:51.539 --> 03:49:53.180]  Ban InfoWars!
[03:49:53.180 --> 03:49:54.500]  Get them off of Facebook!
[03:49:54.500 --> 03:49:56.081]  Get them off of Twitter!
[03:49:56.081 --> 03:49:58.262]  Get them off of every platform you can!
[03:49:58.262 --> 03:50:00.883]  But if it's such a bad strategy, why do they want to shut up?
[03:50:00.883 --> 03:50:03.725]  Because it's the winning strategy!
[03:50:03.725 --> 03:50:04.745]  That's exactly right.
[03:50:04.745 --> 03:50:15.670]  No, they're afraid the President will see you, or me, or David Knight, or Owen Schroer, or any other number of people here at InfoWars telling the truth and laying out what must happen.
[03:50:15.670 --> 03:50:18.091]  And that's the last thing in the world they want.
[03:50:18.091 --> 03:50:18.932]  See, that's why the
[03:50:19.930 --> 03:50:27.713]  It was significant that the Rosenstein story was not published by, say, Breitbart News, or the Daily Caller, or even InfoWars.
[03:50:27.713 --> 03:50:33.274]  It's in the New York Times, and it's triple-sourced, and there's no way to keep it away from him.
[03:50:33.274 --> 03:50:39.336]  There's no way for him not to know that Rosenstein is a weasel... That's my question.
[03:50:39.336 --> 03:50:40.577]  Why was the New York Times...
[03:50:41.597 --> 03:50:41.978]  Exactly.
[03:50:41.978 --> 03:50:45.103]  Why would the New York Times expose one of their globalist operatives, Rosenstein?
[03:50:45.103 --> 03:50:46.765]  He's not the only one.
[03:50:46.765 --> 03:50:47.747]  Why did they burn him?
[03:50:47.747 --> 03:50:53.236]  Because they knew the president already knew and secret documents were coming out, so they wanted to have a controlled release.
[03:50:54.750 --> 03:51:00.491]  Yeah, and I think maybe an early warning to try to dissuade the President from canning it.
[03:51:00.491 --> 03:51:09.533]  Right now, what's going on, even as we speak, is a three-day effort to convince the President not to fire this weasel when they meet tomorrow.
[03:51:09.533 --> 03:51:15.714]  Because if the President had taken action right after he read this story, he would have canned this guy in record time.
[03:51:15.714 --> 03:51:16.094]  I agree.
[03:51:16.094 --> 03:51:17.175]  Who does he put in?
[03:51:17.175 --> 03:51:19.015]  Why does he put Judge Napolitano in?
[03:51:20.106 --> 03:51:22.688]  Well, he needs somebody that's confirmable.
[03:51:22.688 --> 03:51:26.810]  The rumor is a Southern member of the U.S.
[03:51:26.810 --> 03:51:30.833]  Senate who's a known Trump hardliner.
[03:51:30.833 --> 03:51:41.600]  I'm going to guess that that's Senator Richard Shelby from Alabama, the senator from Alabama who isn't comatose or wasn't comatose, unlike Jeff Sessions.
[03:51:41.600 --> 03:51:45.243]  Although I would admit that that is a guess on my part.
[03:51:45.243 --> 03:51:46.864]  It's time to have an attorney general.
[03:51:47.464 --> 03:51:50.625]  Who believes in the rule of law?
[03:51:50.625 --> 03:52:09.392]  In the meantime, if the office were to remain vacant, the two names, and there's some contentious about this, a lawyer named Panuccio, who's the Associate Attorney General from Florida, or Noel Francisco, who is the Solicitor General, confirmed by the U.S.
[03:52:09.392 --> 03:52:13.814]  Senate, either one of them would now be in charge of the Mueller investigation.
[03:52:13.814 --> 03:52:14.714]  And let's expand on this.
[03:52:16.892 --> 03:52:19.213]  You can smell death in the Democratic Party politically.
[03:52:19.213 --> 03:52:21.053]  They're a rotting corpse.
[03:52:21.053 --> 03:52:26.255]  All we have to do is make the right move right now, and we will secure this country's future for a long time.
[03:52:26.255 --> 03:52:36.859]  Let's play a few minutes of the President, though, astutely breaking down the con artistry of Kavanaugh, the whole Kavanaugh attack, and the con artistry of this system to destroy Kavanaugh.
[03:52:36.859 --> 03:52:37.139]  Here it is.
[03:52:37.961 --> 03:52:39.341]  Give us some thoughts, sir.
[03:52:39.341 --> 03:52:41.422]  I think he's just a wonderful human being.
[03:52:41.422 --> 03:52:44.563]  I mean, I think it's horrible what the Democrats have done.
[03:52:44.563 --> 03:52:46.224]  It's a con game they're playing.
[03:52:46.224 --> 03:52:47.864]  They're really con artists.
[03:52:47.864 --> 03:52:53.286]  They're trying to convince... You know, they don't believe it themselves, okay?
[03:52:53.286 --> 03:52:55.327]  They know he's a high-quality person.
[03:52:55.327 --> 03:52:56.727]  They don't believe him.
[03:52:56.727 --> 03:53:00.048]  It's just resist and obstruct.
[03:53:00.048 --> 03:53:01.289]  They're playing a con game.
[03:53:02.113 --> 03:53:03.274]  And they play it very well.
[03:53:03.274 --> 03:53:05.876]  They play it actually much better than the Republicans.
[03:53:05.876 --> 03:53:08.378]  They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy.
[03:53:08.378 --> 03:53:09.579]  They don't know what the hell they're doing.
[03:53:09.579 --> 03:53:11.320]  They want to get rid of ICE.
[03:53:11.320 --> 03:53:14.162]  They want to get rid of law enforcement.
[03:53:14.162 --> 03:53:16.324]  They don't want to take care of our military.
[03:53:16.324 --> 03:53:18.746]  They want to raise your taxes.
[03:53:18.746 --> 03:53:20.467]  But they're good at one thing.
[03:53:20.467 --> 03:53:21.368]  They're good at one thing.
[03:53:21.368 --> 03:53:24.951]  That's obstruction and resisting and con.
[03:53:24.951 --> 03:53:26.492]  He's one of the highest quality
[03:53:27.369 --> 03:53:33.374]  People you know what he said that really what he was focused on was trying to be number one in his class at Yale.
[03:53:33.374 --> 03:53:34.755]  To me that was so believable.
[03:53:34.755 --> 03:53:41.842]  I understand college very well and I understand being number one in your class and I understand a lot of things.
[03:53:41.842 --> 03:53:44.844]  When he said that I understood exactly what he was so
[03:53:46.045 --> 03:53:47.666]  Truthful, and I think it came out.
[03:53:47.666 --> 03:53:54.350]  I mean, I hope it came out, but for the Democrats to be trying to make him into something.
[03:53:54.350 --> 03:53:57.071]  No, but let's be nice about it that he's not.
[03:53:57.071 --> 03:53:58.972]  He's a high quality person.
[03:53:58.972 --> 03:54:01.094]  He's a great intellect.
[03:54:01.094 --> 03:54:03.415]  You're also not seeing him on his footing.
[03:54:03.415 --> 03:54:04.415]  This isn't his footing.
[03:54:04.415 --> 03:54:06.437]  He's never been here before.
[03:54:06.437 --> 03:54:09.058]  He's never had any charges like this.
[03:54:09.058 --> 03:54:13.961]  I mean, charges come up from 36 years ago that are totally unsubstantiated.
[03:54:15.290 --> 03:54:24.459]  I mean, you, as watching this, as the president of a great country, you must say, how is this possible?
[03:54:24.459 --> 03:54:30.826]  36 years ago, nobody ever knew about it, nobody ever heard about it, and now a new charge comes up.
[03:54:30.826 --> 03:54:36.291]  And she said, well, it might not be him, and there were gaps, and she said she was totally inebriated.
[03:54:38.087 --> 03:54:42.169]  All messed up, and she doesn't know it was him, but it might have been him.
[03:54:42.169 --> 03:54:46.630]  Oh, gee, let's not make him a Supreme Court judge because of that.
[03:54:46.630 --> 03:54:49.391]  This is a con game being played by the Democrats.
[03:54:49.391 --> 03:54:52.052]  Also, take a look at the lawyers.
[03:54:52.052 --> 03:54:55.654]  These lawyers are the same lawyers that have been fighting for years.
[03:54:56.534 --> 03:54:57.835]  They keep fighting.
[03:54:57.835 --> 03:54:59.336]  Take a look at the lawyers.
[03:54:59.336 --> 03:55:02.078]  And it's a shame that you can do this to a person's life.
[03:55:02.078 --> 03:55:10.643]  And I'll tell you, maybe even more important, who's going to want to go before this system to be a Supreme Court judge or to be a judge?
[03:55:10.643 --> 03:55:11.464]  Stop right there.
[03:55:11.464 --> 03:55:14.566]  He goes on, the terrorizing of everyone that's backed Trump.
[03:55:16.468 --> 03:55:18.489]  I almost disagree with the president here.
[03:55:18.489 --> 03:55:20.149]  Does it make you not want to?
[03:55:20.149 --> 03:55:22.970]  It's like Clarence Thomas said, this is all BS, but I'm here to clear my name.
[03:55:22.970 --> 03:55:24.391]  You're not making me back down.
[03:55:24.391 --> 03:55:27.212]  I don't want this judgeship, but you're not going to destroy me.
[03:55:27.212 --> 03:55:30.313]  And so they put us in this existential crisis.
[03:55:30.313 --> 03:55:33.434]  It actually, I think, makes us man up, Roger.
[03:55:33.434 --> 03:55:37.155]  And so I think there's going to be a big price to pay in 40 days.
[03:55:37.155 --> 03:55:38.075]  I think red wave.
[03:55:38.075 --> 03:55:39.596]  There's a seawall of election fraud.
[03:55:40.700 --> 03:55:46.147]  But I, gut level, man, I think we're going to see the House and Senate held.
[03:55:46.147 --> 03:55:48.069]  And then what happens if that's true, Roger?
[03:55:48.069 --> 03:55:50.092]  A. Do you think Kavanaugh gets confirmed gut level?
[03:55:50.092 --> 03:55:53.055]  B. Red Wave, Blue Wave, or a stalemate?
[03:55:53.055 --> 03:55:55.098]  And then what does the left do when they lose?
[03:55:56.380 --> 03:56:03.041]  This has stirred Trump-supporting voters and those who voted for Trump in 2016 like nothing else.
[03:56:03.041 --> 03:56:17.024]  The story on page one in yesterday's New York Times by Jonathan Martin about why the Kavanaugh controversy is going to lead to a blue wave and why voters are going to be revolted by the Republicans' treatment of women is total bourgeois.
[03:56:17.024 --> 03:56:17.964]  Nonsense.
[03:56:17.964 --> 03:56:21.105]  His uninformed opinion based on nothing.
[03:56:21.645 --> 03:56:36.978]  On the contrary, as I move around, I find conservatives and moderates and pro-Trump voters angry and motivated to turn out because they're revolted about the character assassination against Judge Kavanaugh.
[03:56:36.978 --> 03:56:43.563]  And doesn't the censorship on social media make conservatives be sure to not just vote but get others to vote?
[03:56:43.563 --> 03:56:45.404]  I think it is a vital part of it.
[03:56:45.404 --> 03:56:47.306]  Look, you've got the senator from Hawaii admitted.
[03:56:47.941 --> 03:56:51.622]  Doesn't matter whether any of this stuff of Kavanaugh is true, she says.
[03:56:51.622 --> 03:56:55.824]  He must withdraw because the charges have been made.
[03:56:55.824 --> 03:56:58.024]  No, Senator, you should withdraw.
[03:56:58.024 --> 03:56:59.785]  You should resign from the Senate.
[03:56:59.785 --> 03:57:03.526]  You've soiled yourself with inane comments like that.
[03:57:03.986 --> 03:57:10.072]  We have a system under which you are innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.
[03:57:10.072 --> 03:57:15.697]  The people who have accused Kavanaugh have no corroboration, no eyewitnesses, no proof.
[03:57:15.697 --> 03:57:16.577]  And it's getting obvious.
[03:57:16.577 --> 03:57:17.999]  Alright, you'll join us tonight.
[03:57:17.999 --> 03:57:18.999]  We're going right to midnight.
[03:57:18.999 --> 03:57:20.561]  We've got a bunch of special guests.
[03:57:20.561 --> 03:57:22.262]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:57:23.243 --> 03:57:28.930]  Owen Benjamin is joining us, Will Johnson, Roger Stone, Owen Schwerer, but a bunch of others.

[03:57:36.519 --> 03:57:38.821]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
