[00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:13.802]  Big Brother.
[00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:15.044]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:16.745]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:18.988]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:20.329]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.575]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.675]  Storm clouds gather, war looms, the dictatorship run by the mullahs over in Iran.
[00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:41.797]  Yesterday threatened the mother of all wars.
[00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:43.278]  Saddam Hussein did that as well.
[00:00:43.318 --> 00:00:46.520]  Things didn't turn out, didn't turn out too well with all that bluster.
[00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:54.305]  And then Trump responded saying don't ever threaten us again or the consequences you will face will be what few have suffered.
[00:00:56.857 --> 00:01:02.380]  That is obviously one of the big stories that is front and center to Iranian president.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.402]  Never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer.
[00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:13.325]  Consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.
[00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:20.288]  We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death.
[00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.389]  Be cautious.
[00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.670]  Don't tread on me.
[00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.191]  He could have added, but he didn't.
[00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:26.511]  So there you go.
[00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:37.293]  Meanwhile, I've become punch drunk to this, and it's one of the few areas we've failed in, because I don't even look for these stories, and they're just buried out there, but I see them here and there every day.
[00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:40.094]  20, 30 of them, to the point I don't even cover it.
[00:01:40.314 --> 00:01:41.134]  But we're going to today.
[00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:42.354]  This is just today.
[00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:46.595]  One killed, 14 wounded as government opens fire in Toronto.
[00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:49.796]  Terrorism suspected, but they'll cover it up in the media.
[00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:54.700]  If it was a right winger or it was a school shooting, you never hear the end of it and they blame all gun owners.
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.982]  But when it's Islamic, underneath the old ruggy.
[00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:02.945]  Three men arrested over acid attack on three-year-old British boy.
[00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:06.027]  And of course you know where that came from.
[00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:09.010]  They now have seven acid attacks a day in London.
[00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.992]  Dirty, stinking Belgians, what they screamed.
[00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.454]  Migrant gangs pelt handicapped old lady with stones.
[00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:19.617]  This is just today, up on Infowars.com.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.343]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:28.547]  And I've got more reports of that we'll be getting into.
[00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.711]  Big article in the New York Times appraising George Soros and attacking me.
[00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.553]  We're going to be getting into some of that.
[00:02:34.593 --> 00:02:36.815]  George Soros bet big on liberal democracy.
[00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.476]  Now he fears he's losing.
[00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:42.340]  Liberal democracy, is that what you call what's in the WikiLeaks, Stu?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.983]  In the free press worldwide, have your fact-checkers run the Internet?
[00:02:47.028 --> 00:02:50.509]  Which, when we learned that two years ago on WikiLeaks, I thought was insanely bold.
[00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:58.832]  Turns out he does fund Media Matters and the Southern Primary Law Center and Snopes and the other mail-order catalog place that now runs it all.
[00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:00.472]  I've actually got an article here.
[00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:10.816]  Remember that lady that said that the double amputee war hero was a Nazi because he had an Iron Cross
[00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:21.224]  symbol on his arm, it was the name of their unit, and it had to do with the Greeks, you know, have you ever seen Fire Engine's Lady?
[00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:30.372]  They've got that type of, it's not really an iron cross, it's an old, the Scots use it, the Italians use it, it's used by the Catholics, it's used by everybody.
[00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:31.774]  It's all over churches all over the world.
[00:03:32.354 --> 00:03:34.436]  Well, it even had his unit number under it.
[00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:36.278]  Doesn't matter, she called him a Nazi.
[00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:37.884]  And who is she?
[00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:39.025]  Can't make this up.
[00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:42.007]  Fact checker who misidentified ICE agent's Nazi tattoo.
[00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:44.728]  Hired by Media Matters to research alt-right.
[00:03:45.188 --> 00:03:46.209]  And so just made it up.
[00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.731]  That's what these folks do.
[00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:51.952]  Is just lie, lie, lie.
[00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:53.272]  But they're the fact checkers.
[00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:53.553]  Why?
[00:03:53.973 --> 00:03:55.674]  Oh, you're an SJW out of college.
[00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:02.737]  Well, we're going to hire 20,000 of you from your fever swamp and we're going to go put you into
[00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.228]  The positions at Google, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:11.108]  All of it.
[00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:13.069]  And you are going to run everything.
[00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.449]  And you are the boss now.
[00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.350]  You rule America.
[00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.050]  You rule the world.
[00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.951]  It was in WikiLeaks two years ago that Soros wanted Obama to fully hand the Internet over to the UN.
[00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:24.212]  He only did it partially.
[00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:28.233]  You see what the EU is doing now with all their censorship reaching into the US.
[00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:31.194]  And they actually said that
[00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:36.594]  He would then control and only their news would be pushed to everyone.
[00:04:36.614 --> 00:04:37.074]  And guess what?
[00:04:37.354 --> 00:04:38.094]  Hillary lost.
[00:04:38.814 --> 00:04:40.235]  They still went ahead with it though.
[00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:42.435]  And Trump needs to do something about this.
[00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:44.535]  He's been talking about the Washington Post.
[00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:45.736]  Now they're on about Bezos.
[00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:46.516]  Now they're liars.
[00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:47.836]  And now he made tax.
[00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.157]  He'll get rid of the tax exemption of Amazon.
[00:04:50.177 --> 00:04:50.637]  That's great.
[00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:54.018]  But the big enchiladas, Google, Twitter and Facebook.
[00:04:54.138 --> 00:04:55.898]  That's the big enchiladas there, President.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.164]  Anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:12.968]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:19.994]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines.
[00:05:20.714 --> 00:05:23.917]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:28.339]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:30.039]  And my only message is this.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.381]  Everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:41.705]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:45.046]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:45.986]  We already have the power.
[00:05:46.247 --> 00:05:51.129]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.411]  InfoWars is on the front line, and so are you.
[00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:55.991]  We are the resistance!
[00:06:04.076 --> 00:06:06.277]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:06.798 --> 00:06:11.941]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.712]  Unbelievable the amount of news and information we have here today.
[00:06:25.673 --> 00:06:29.156]  Iran is a lot bigger foe than Iraq.
[00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:37.953]  If you know the history, you know the CIA put Saddam Hussein into power as the head of the Ba'ath security apparatus.
[00:06:37.973 --> 00:06:41.574]  They told the Ba'ath party they'd quit assassinating him in 1970.
[00:06:41.954 --> 00:06:45.075]  They put Saddam Hussein as the head of security.
[00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:51.777]  Then, nine years later, the CIA funded a coup against the Ba'athist leadership and put Saddam Hussein in.
[00:06:52.257 --> 00:06:53.737]  Three years later, the U.S.
[00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:56.898]  funded Saddam billions of dollars to launch
[00:06:58.578 --> 00:06:59.559]  The Iran-Iraq War.
[00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.222]  They killed about 2.5 million Iranians.
[00:07:03.744 --> 00:07:05.525]  900,000 Iraqis died in that war.
[00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:06.486]  And then the U.S.
[00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:10.310]  turned around under new policies under George Herbert Walker Bush and said, you owe us $32 billion.
[00:07:13.482 --> 00:07:24.029]  And Saddam, trained by the CIA in 1958 to 1960, this is all in the congressional record, said, I have been loyal to the United States and we just lost 900,000 people.
[00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:28.392]  That's money that you were supposed to forgive via our oil sales.
[00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:38.999]  But instead they drove the prices down, as you remember, shut him up, went in, destabilized the country, pulled out, and then went back in in 2003, took him out.
[00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:40.139]  I'm not saying he's an angel.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.541]  I'm not saying I like him, but he was like Gaddafi.
[00:07:44.514 --> 00:07:46.455]  But previously he totally worked for the U.S.
[00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:48.076]  Gaddafi never did.
[00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:52.078]  He was a real resistance guy, a terrorist, a socialist, call him what you want.
[00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:58.902]  He came out of the cold for eight years, invested tens of billions exactly where the U.S.
[00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:02.284]  and exactly where France, who used to control Libya, told him to do it.
[00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:03.205]  That was his deal.
[00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:05.006]  He loved Obama, met with him.
[00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:06.787]  He was totally set up.
[00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:08.691]  And was calling U.S.
[00:08:08.731 --> 00:08:18.077]  congressmen and others, that we've talked to on air, saying, I have the agreements, I have everything, I went to France, they came here, we're friends, why?
[00:08:18.678 --> 00:08:19.718]  I let you have the whole country.
[00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:20.999]  I just want to build it up.
[00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:25.683]  I want universities and big buildings and we have a big aquifer.
[00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:28.204]  They said, dude, we're destabilizing all Africa.
[00:08:28.464 --> 00:08:29.725]  We're going to destroy you.
[00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:31.026]  It was very evil.
[00:08:32.848 --> 00:08:34.649]  Now, Trump says that's all wrong.
[00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:37.491]  Trump says that's wrong.
[00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:40.012]  He's being pragmatic and saying we want to have stability in the Middle East.
[00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:43.113]  He's gone and told Saudi Arabia that, and they say they've gotten on board with it.
[00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:45.954]  Who knows if that's actually going to pan out, but Trump's trying.
[00:08:47.275 --> 00:08:49.436]  Iran is in a different kettle of fish.
[00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:52.757]  They are the Shiites.
[00:08:53.177 --> 00:08:54.558]  They're 19% of Islam.
[00:08:54.598 --> 00:08:55.538]  They are hereditary.
[00:08:55.938 --> 00:09:00.680]  That's why the Ayatollahs all look alike, because they're a form of religious royalty.
[00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:10.105]  They are a form of monotheistic royalty, a royal priest class that is insular and elects into itself.
[00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:14.650]  And of course, you have all the inbreeding like the British and royalty and the German royalty.
[00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.234]  And you've got the mental illness that comes with that, the paranoia.
[00:09:19.394 --> 00:09:22.538]  But I mean, if you look at the ayatollahs, there's a reason they look all the same.
[00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:28.811]  Like the Tsar looked compared to his British cousin, the King of England.
[00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:31.653]  Have you ever looked at the last Tsar and the King of England at the time?
[00:09:31.913 --> 00:09:33.233]  You couldn't differentiate the two apart.
[00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:36.555]  Same height, same look, same mole, same eyes.
[00:09:37.135 --> 00:09:37.875]  They're wives.
[00:09:38.075 --> 00:09:39.956]  In fact, they even did some jokes when they were visiting each other.
[00:09:40.457 --> 00:09:42.958]  Couldn't tell them apart when they wore each other's uniforms.
[00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:51.061]  And of course, World War I came along and the Brits set up their own cousins and flushed them down the toilet and put the Bolsheviks in power.
[00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:52.262]  But that's a whole other story.
[00:09:53.171 --> 00:10:01.253]  Yes, the Tsars were German royalty, which were really Eastern royalty that came in and took over the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[00:10:01.553 --> 00:10:04.374]  So you want to go back, Hungarian, Romanian, mixed with Germans.
[00:10:04.714 --> 00:10:05.275]  Yeah, there they are.
[00:10:05.335 --> 00:10:06.915]  There's the King of England and the King of Russia.
[00:10:07.675 --> 00:10:09.916]  Indistinguishable, like a breed of dog.
[00:10:11.906 --> 00:10:19.009]  There are German shepherds and other dogs that are so bred, so close, you can't tell them apart, even though they're from different litters, different mothers, different fathers.
[00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:20.030]  But I'm digressing.
[00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.151]  See, when I see a problem, I have a lot of history I bring to it.
[00:10:24.632 --> 00:10:30.814]  And that's what's so frustrating about all of this, is that the average person doesn't have the background to understand what's happening.
[00:10:30.874 --> 00:10:33.516]  So, Iran has nuclear weapons.
[00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:37.277]  I confirmed that over a decade ago from high-level sources.
[00:10:37.997 --> 00:10:40.879]  Now you see that in the news this year, that they've really got nukes already.
[00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.777]  Pakistan obviously has over 100, and they have delivery systems as well, so does India.
[00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:46.758]  India's probably got 300, 400.
[00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:57.225]  Israel's got over a thousand now, and high-tech delivery systems, cruise missiles, submarine-launched, air-launched, ICBM, medium-range, everything.
[00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.607]  So, it's a giant tinderbox.
[00:11:01.408 --> 00:11:04.750]  In history, no one ever stops weapons proliferation, and it's happened.
[00:11:05.351 --> 00:11:09.714]  And so, Iran is teetering on collapse.
[00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:13.766]  They've got their oil export, they can't even refine their own oil.
[00:11:15.027 --> 00:11:21.932]  And so, they've been funding Hezbollah in Syria and other areas.
[00:11:21.952 --> 00:11:32.080]  And the Pentagon made a deal when they told Obama that they weren't going to back Al-Qaeda and ISIS and turn over Syria to Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:35.730]  They believe it will just become a huge quagmire and draw the U.S.
[00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.051]  into it and be worse than Vietnam.
[00:11:37.332 --> 00:11:39.494]  So they told Obama, if you remember, no, we're not going to do this.
[00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:43.079]  It was right after Benghazi, the military basically threatened Obama with a coup.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.881]  They said, we're not doing this.
[00:11:44.921 --> 00:11:48.786]  But now, five, six years later, Iran made a deal behind the scenes.
[00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:51.549]  We first broke all this salt, later came out other sources.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:12:08.367]  That once we stabilize, you're not going to have a Shiite kingdom, we're not going to have a Sunni kingdom, it's going to be run the way it's been run, with real elections, with a coalition government, and Assad agrees to step down after there are real elections.
[00:12:09.347 --> 00:12:11.088]  We've now moved up to that timetable.
[00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:19.432]  And even though Trump is in charge to a certain extent, there's a lot of games going on with the Pentagon, still backing some Al-Qaeda groups,
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.001]  Israel's been caught doing it as well.
[00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:22.742]  That's just a fact.
[00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:24.023]  That's going on in the South.
[00:12:25.264 --> 00:12:26.885]  And the Iranians are saying, we're not leaving.
[00:12:27.026 --> 00:12:28.046]  We're not leaving Lebanon.
[00:12:29.147 --> 00:12:31.129]  We're not leaving Syria.
[00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:31.990]  We're not leaving anywhere.
[00:12:33.564 --> 00:12:37.228]  And so Trump has been backing opposition inside Iran.
[00:12:37.248 --> 00:12:40.511]  About 75% of people don't like the mullahs.
[00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:42.693]  More than half their population is under the age of 30.
[00:12:43.573 --> 00:12:46.376]  People, there's internal polls, they do not like the mullahs.
[00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:47.797]  It's a dictatorship.
[00:12:48.618 --> 00:12:50.039]  Who likes royalty anyways?
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.065]  But that's what that Islamic State is now under that particular brand of Shiite Islam.
[00:12:57.245 --> 00:13:04.287]  So they are now threatening, that's the background, they are now threatening to attack the United States, the mother of all wars.
[00:13:05.607 --> 00:13:07.888]  Saddam said that on the eve of the first Gulf War.
[00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:13.710]  And of course the United States just went in and bought off about 80% of his generals.
[00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:19.331]  So they stood down and would actually be waiting at the convoy lines to be paid off.
[00:13:20.211 --> 00:13:21.772]  Then the United States blew up
[00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:25.223]  More than 70 chemical bunkers.
[00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:27.188]  Chemical weapons rained down.
[00:13:28.312 --> 00:13:30.798]  Low dosages, but it still created the Gulf War Syndrome.
[00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:36.160]  We've had top scientists, top army experts, medical doctors on, like Doug Rocky, to break all that down.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:51.265]  So we ended up having hundreds of thousands die in the next decade from Gulf War illness because the order went in by the UN that was in control, that was a UN operation commanding US forces, if you look it up, to destroy the chemicals in place.
[00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:55.306]  Camascia was the biggest chemical weapons bunker in the world.
[00:13:57.464 --> 00:14:08.333]  So, very bizarre to have the Ayatollah, the hereditary Shiite dictator of Iran, who they flew in out of abstentia with Ayatollah Khomeini in 79.
[00:14:10.534 --> 00:14:12.856]  By the way, the CIA was really behind that old double-cross.
[00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:14.898]  And then the Iranians flipped on him.
[00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:24.265]  Iran warns Trump not to cut off oil exports, threatens mother of all wars, don't play with a lion's tail, this would only lead to regret.
[00:14:25.986 --> 00:14:26.247]  And then,
[00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:30.813]  Trump tells Iran's dictator, never threaten the U.S.
[00:14:30.853 --> 00:14:32.433]  again or suffer consequences.
[00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:37.674]  And we've already read that tweet to you, but let's pull up Trump's tweet because it's pretty important.
[00:14:37.694 --> 00:14:39.855]  We'll probably read that a second time here in a moment.
[00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:43.935]  To Iranian president, never ever threatens.
[00:14:43.975 --> 00:14:45.096]  He's addressing the president.
[00:14:45.356 --> 00:14:48.376]  And again, the Ayatollahs pick who can run for president.
[00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:54.998]  So it's kind of like the Communist Central Committee and Politburo picks who's allowed
[00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:57.872]  They elect the president.
[00:14:58.013 --> 00:14:59.919]  I mean, it's pretty much the same thing they're doing here.
[00:15:00.823 --> 00:15:03.311]  But in Iran, they let them have an election, but they choose who can run.
[00:15:04.602 --> 00:15:11.629]  The Iranian president never ever threatened the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.
[00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:17.575]  You are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death.
[00:15:17.695 --> 00:15:18.636]  Be cautious.
[00:15:18.676 --> 00:15:19.717]  So the U.S.
[00:15:19.738 --> 00:15:21.679]  is no longer a country that will put up with that type of stuff.
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.782]  We will go over all of that.
[00:15:23.862 --> 00:15:27.786]  President Trump's highest approval rating ever in the Wall Street Journal NBC poll.
[00:15:29.264 --> 00:15:32.905]  Trump says Carter Page FISA application confirmed FBI DOJ misled courts.
[00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:34.385]  We've been saying that for a year and a half.
[00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:35.806]  That's the key to bringing down these crooks.
[00:15:36.326 --> 00:15:39.327]  It's all coming up as the media admits Trump was illegally surveilled.
[00:15:39.687 --> 00:15:45.609]  Then they went and got a fake warrant to reverse engineer it or to parallel construct it after that point.
[00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:49.630]  We've got so much though to cover straight ahead on the other side.
[00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.370]  Believe me you don't want to miss this broadcast.
[00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.711]  It's now come out in the news Hillary got caught secretly meeting with Putin.
[00:15:55.151 --> 00:15:55.911]  That straight ahead.
[00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:57.672]  Oh and she now says she can hardly stand up.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.663]  The deep state is making its move.
[00:16:03.304 --> 00:16:10.934]  Multiple members of Congress, the FBI, the CIA, are all on television saying, we need the military to remove the president.
[00:16:11.795 --> 00:16:16.922]  We need a coup in this country, bare minimum, 25th Amendment, to remove him from office.
[00:16:16.982 --> 00:16:17.323]  And why?
[00:16:17.783 --> 00:16:30.901]  Because he went and had a summit a year and a half plus into office that he should have had a month into office with Vladimir Putin and met with him privately just like he did with Theresa May and dozens of other world leaders like the communist Chinese dictator.
[00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:34.205]  Think about that, calling it treason, calling it traitorous.
[00:16:35.146 --> 00:16:42.931]  That Trump was nice to Putin in his language, when in truth, Trump has been crushing Russia with expanded U.S.
[00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:47.853]  energy sales, by shipping missiles into Ukraine to fight the Russians, with all these sanctions.
[00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:48.734]  It's incredible.
[00:16:49.094 --> 00:16:50.335]  But here's the big takeaway.
[00:16:50.995 --> 00:16:53.296]  Hiding in plain view that they hope you don't pay attention to.
[00:16:53.597 --> 00:16:55.818]  The Democrats are the party of globalism.
[00:16:57.017 --> 00:17:08.602]  Along with the blue-blood Republicans like George Herbert Walker Bush and his New World Order speech, globalism is about taking national sovereignty away and transferring it to the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN.
[00:17:09.402 --> 00:17:10.603]  The EU is unelected.
[00:17:11.223 --> 00:17:13.584]  It's in a trade war with us with giant tariffs on us.
[00:17:14.324 --> 00:17:16.267]  Canada, China, they all have huge tariffs.
[00:17:16.307 --> 00:17:17.248]  We have nothing on them.
[00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:20.372]  Trump is 100% fighting for the country.
[00:17:20.592 --> 00:17:22.154]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:23.977]  It's America first.
[00:17:24.297 --> 00:17:28.703]  Our military, our borders, our everything, that's what you do when you strengthen the nation.
[00:17:29.144 --> 00:17:31.106]  The globalists are about weakening the nation.
[00:17:31.607 --> 00:17:32.067]  Democrat,
[00:17:33.209 --> 00:17:37.633]  Appellate court, Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags in schools on the West Coast.
[00:17:37.713 --> 00:17:38.514]  It's a hate symbol.
[00:17:39.035 --> 00:17:40.156]  They hate flyover country.
[00:17:40.316 --> 00:17:41.277]  They hate bitter clingers.
[00:17:41.797 --> 00:17:43.199]  The universities hate America.
[00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:44.200]  They hate free speech.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.382]  They're the party of globalism.
[00:17:46.702 --> 00:17:48.544]  They're the party of the New World Order.
[00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:54.871]  They're the party of destroying America's sovereignty, breaking our families up, demoralizing us, creating racial strife.
[00:17:55.091 --> 00:17:56.052]  It's all in the WikiLeaks!
[00:17:56.392 --> 00:17:57.654]  They're the ones of fake news.
[00:17:57.734 --> 00:17:59.055]  They're the ones that rig the debates.
[00:17:59.135 --> 00:18:02.499]  They're the ones that steal billions of dollars and launder money with their foundations.
[00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:08.725]  They're the ones caught in child sex trafficking with Jeffrey Epstein and Lolita Express and all the rest of it.
[00:18:09.106 --> 00:18:09.746]  They're the enemy.
[00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:28.680]  And then they turn around and point their finger at Trump, who's clearly America first, classic Americana, and the country coming back from the dead, and say because he met with the second biggest nuclear arms country in the world, he better be meeting with him and talking to him, that he's a traitor, and that the military needs to remove him?
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.502]  That sounds like something out of the old Soviet Union!
[00:18:32.442 --> 00:18:35.223]  Just like the left's calling for me to be banned and taken off the air.
[00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:36.643]  They openly admit it.
[00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:38.524]  They are the clear and present danger.
[00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:39.684]  They're the globalists.
[00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:40.544]  They're the deep state.
[00:18:40.824 --> 00:18:45.825]  And now this hype even has some conservatives going, well, I guess he should have been tougher on Putin.
[00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:47.526]  Yeah, we're a nation.
[00:18:47.786 --> 00:18:48.826]  We were sovereign.
[00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:50.506]  We're being taken over by Russia.
[00:18:51.307 --> 00:18:52.687]  Russia has the same enemy as us.
[00:18:53.647 --> 00:18:54.288]  George Soros.
[00:18:54.308 --> 00:19:03.134]  A lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion, but does it make him, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[00:19:03.474 --> 00:19:06.796]  It's the multinationals working with the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[00:19:07.317 --> 00:19:10.199]  It's Hollywood owned by the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:11.960]  Not the Russians and not Trump.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.482]  If the Russians were doing any of this, I'd be their enemy.
[00:19:14.842 --> 00:19:15.443]  But they're not.
[00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:18.385]  They're trying to stabilize themselves just like we are.
[00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:21.887]  Every sovereign nation in the world is under globalist attack.
[00:19:22.547 --> 00:19:28.811]  Infowars is on the front lines fighting against that and promoting true open free societies and free market capitalism.
[00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:29.831]  And so is Trump.
[00:19:30.132 --> 00:19:34.074]  And I stand with him against all the bullies and all the followers and all the cowards.
[00:19:34.314 --> 00:19:37.616]  And I know we're going to continue to win thanks to all of you in the Infowars.
[00:19:37.796 --> 00:19:41.458]  But make no mistake, they're making their move and they are the enemy.
[00:19:41.798 --> 00:19:43.720]  They are the threat to this nation.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.102]  It's sovereignty and our people's safety and prosperity.
[00:19:48.602 --> 00:19:51.724]  I'm Alex Jones, reporting for duty in the battle for the Republic.
[00:19:52.245 --> 00:19:53.125]  The year is 2018.
[00:19:54.006 --> 00:19:54.866]  History's happening now.
[00:19:55.326 --> 00:19:56.847]  Choose which side you're on.
[00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:06.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.698 --> 00:20:17.200]  We are on the march.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.003]  The empire is on the run.
[00:20:20.744 --> 00:20:24.528]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:30.956 --> 00:20:33.578]  Iran is in control of their sizable military.
[00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:41.837]  Iran's paramilitary force, Hezbollah, is stationed all over the world and has infiltrated western countries everywhere.
[00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:55.868]  And if there is a war with Iran, undoubtedly there will be massive, serious, real terror attacks all over the United States, all over Europe, anyone involved in the attack.
[00:20:56.789 --> 00:21:02.954]  That's why if Iran does launch attacks on our ships, where it's most likely to start, they've already been doing it.
[00:21:03.034 --> 00:21:06.917]  Trump says he won't just let them belligerently grab our forces or attack them.
[00:21:07.877 --> 00:21:12.181]  We have to have an overwhelming response, decapitating the Iranian leadership immediately.
[00:21:13.261 --> 00:21:17.424]  And you'll probably have to hit their forces in the field with very, very heavy weapons.
[00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:20.947]  And when I say heavy weapons, I'm talking about tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:21:21.508 --> 00:21:24.570]  So expect that to be used in the Middle East, and if anybody
[00:21:26.238 --> 00:21:31.166]  ...moves in any direction with another nuclear power, like they're gonna try to block us, they're gonna end up getting hit.
[00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:33.510]  So I can tell you right now, under U.S.
[00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:38.077]  military doctrine, we are very close to the final DEATHCON right now.
[00:21:38.868 --> 00:21:41.790]  With Iran threatening preemptive attacks on the United States.
[00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:51.255]  They are not Saddam Hussein, whose military was set up by the CIA, who advised them for decades, who had relationships with all of them, so they could be paid off to stand down.
[00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:55.017]  And I'm not saying our military didn't face a lot of stuff in Gulf War I or Gulf War II.
[00:21:55.437 --> 00:22:00.900]  Militias, infighting groups, some of the military fought back, chemicals in the air, D.E.U.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:07.944]  But a war with Iran could very possibly trigger a new world war, most analysts believe.
[00:22:08.993 --> 00:22:11.695]  That's why Trump's been trying to have peace through strength.
[00:22:13.577 --> 00:22:14.477]  We've broken it all down.
[00:22:14.497 --> 00:22:18.981]  We're going to break it more down in detail as this information unfolds.
[00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:23.144]  Now, let's get into the other news here.
[00:22:24.966 --> 00:22:33.012]  In this segment, I want to just have a smattering of news so folks get an idea how I analyze information and how my brain works.
[00:22:34.513 --> 00:22:35.514]  I've got an article here
[00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:39.540]  It's a big scandal in the L.A.
[00:22:39.621 --> 00:22:42.982]  Times, you name it, that L.A.
[00:22:43.043 --> 00:22:47.365]  authorities recorded privileged attorney-client conversations, District Attorney says.
[00:22:47.925 --> 00:22:52.168]  And it's a huge scandal and all these convictions and things may be thrown out of court.
[00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:55.350]  Because it says it's illegal.
[00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.571]  Illegal is the word.
[00:22:57.671 --> 00:22:58.171]  Illegal.
[00:22:58.492 --> 00:22:59.632]  See right there if you're a TV viewer?
[00:23:00.073 --> 00:23:01.013]  Illegal.
[00:23:01.433 --> 00:23:04.115]  Now, how does my brain work?
[00:23:06.189 --> 00:23:22.381]  Politico AP Reuters last week on Monday had the headline Mueller is listening to Manafort's jail calls about his legal defense and then filed in federal court telling they have two cases against him.
[00:23:24.282 --> 00:23:27.405]  One obstructing and then the other money laundering.
[00:23:28.561 --> 00:23:41.364]  So they've charged him in relation to this case that they're listening to everything he's doing and then they use his legal arguments saying we know he doesn't really have a defense but he just wants to stall these and wants to have this other case first.
[00:23:41.964 --> 00:23:43.725]  So we want him in solitary confinement.
[00:23:46.665 --> 00:23:50.146]  See, when I saw those headlines and read that, the top of my head blew off.
[00:23:51.106 --> 00:23:53.867]  And then I talked about it on air and no one even cared.
[00:23:58.167 --> 00:24:00.008]  It's in the Constitution you don't do that.
[00:24:00.048 --> 00:24:03.030]  And they tried this weird doublespeak where they go, well they didn't listen to his attorneys.
[00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.252]  They listened to him talk to his advisors about his legal strategy.
[00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:11.954]  You don't listen to people's jail phone calls.
[00:24:14.035 --> 00:24:18.878]  And you sure don't take it and then put it in a federal filing to a judge.
[00:24:20.674 --> 00:24:30.196]  He's saying, we want you to try this case first because we heard his legal theory is to try this other one first because he believes it will show exculpatory evidence in the other case.
[00:24:30.816 --> 00:24:32.396]  Well that just proves his point!
[00:24:33.056 --> 00:24:36.137]  And I even called some lawyers I know, criminal lawyers, some really good ones.
[00:24:36.497 --> 00:24:37.397]  I have a good criminal lawyer.
[00:24:37.417 --> 00:24:45.119]  Not that I've ever needed him, but I used him for Rob Dew and they have a large settlement for when the police wrongfully arrested him covering an event in Cleveland.
[00:24:53.686 --> 00:24:54.407]  It was the G20.
[00:24:56.168 --> 00:25:01.992]  The point is, is that they said, absolutely, that's crazy, send me the article, and they couldn't believe it.
[00:25:03.093 --> 00:25:09.778]  And I'm telling you, even CNN has admitted, man, Mueller's took the gloves off, he's been doing stuff for a year and a half, nobody's ever done.
[00:25:10.139 --> 00:25:10.519]  Boy!
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.163]  And the federal judges are like, yeah, you can grab everything in his house, doesn't matter if it's not on the warrant.
[00:25:17.304 --> 00:25:17.985]  And they charge him
[00:25:20.014 --> 00:25:28.196]  For offshore bank accounts that are legal and lawful and claiming he didn't declare all his taxes 14 years ago.
[00:25:29.136 --> 00:25:32.337]  It just shows how out of control it is.
[00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:48.181]  Meanwhile, Mueller is on a tarmac giving uranium to the Russians for Hillary Clinton when she's Secretary of State in 2010 for a deal.
[00:25:48.281 --> 00:25:49.401]  And I went and pulled up
[00:25:50.663 --> 00:26:09.414]  The New York Times, The Washington Post, back when they were somewhat truthful at the time, and I've got the articles and anybody could pull them up where they were like, man this is really unethical that he's doing this for the Secretary of State while her husband's making a deal with Uranium One for hundreds of millions of dollars that they made and Tony Podesta made tens of millions.
[00:26:12.936 --> 00:26:14.097]  But then you go to Snopes
[00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:21.353]  Literally funded by George Soros, and they go, oh, it's not true, but don't show any facts.
[00:26:21.733 --> 00:26:23.573]  It's in the news.
[00:26:23.733 --> 00:26:24.313]  They admit it.
[00:26:24.853 --> 00:26:25.154]  Look at this.
[00:26:25.514 --> 00:26:26.294]  Can't make it up.
[00:26:26.794 --> 00:26:32.596]  Fact checker who misidentified ICE agents, Nazi tattoo, hired by Media Matters to research alt-right.
[00:26:34.096 --> 00:26:34.756]  It's the same thing.
[00:26:34.796 --> 00:26:42.078]  They just hire these complete kook balls who just make up whatever they want, and they're like an imperial judge or something.
[00:26:42.298 --> 00:26:44.879]  What they say, right out of college, is God.
[00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:51.787]  Well, let's see him try to weasel out of this one.
[00:26:51.827 --> 00:26:52.507]  Get ready for this.
[00:26:53.467 --> 00:26:55.188]  This was the Daily Caller over the weekend.
[00:26:55.208 --> 00:26:57.468]  It was New York Times, Washington Post, everywhere.
[00:26:58.209 --> 00:27:06.511]  Remember, Hillary said she thinks Trump's compromised for a meeting with Putin at a sanctioned official meeting in public and behind closed doors.
[00:27:06.571 --> 00:27:07.131]  Totally normal.
[00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:08.272]  Everybody does that every time.
[00:27:08.772 --> 00:27:09.352]  That's standard.
[00:27:09.612 --> 00:27:10.572]  I tweeted it yesterday.
[00:27:11.012 --> 00:27:16.694]  Somebody made a great meme that shows Clinton shaking hands, Bush shaking hands, Hillary shaking hands.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.361]  Obama shaking hands with Putin.
[00:27:20.802 --> 00:27:22.383]  Go to RealAlexJones on Twitter, guys.
[00:27:23.063 --> 00:27:24.284]  Shaking hands with everybody.
[00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:27.626]  Putin shaking hands with everybody.
[00:27:28.847 --> 00:27:32.110]  But then, when Trump does it, it's called treason.
[00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.153]  By Brennan, who is an admitted member of the Communist Party.
[00:27:39.335 --> 00:27:40.916]  So, go to RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[00:27:40.976 --> 00:27:42.217]  It's a great little meme we put out.
[00:27:44.278 --> 00:27:47.321]  On my Twitter, got stats on it out about 4 o'clock.
[00:27:48.131 --> 00:27:49.673]  And I'll show people that when we come back.
[00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:51.875]  But, here it is.
[00:27:52.035 --> 00:27:54.898]  Hillary crashes Trump over Putin meeting.
[00:27:55.399 --> 00:27:56.880]  Suggests he's compromised.
[00:27:58.742 --> 00:28:00.964]  And then it goes on, breaking.
[00:28:01.025 --> 00:28:03.888]  Hillary Clinton admits she met secretly with Putin in 2014.
[00:28:03.988 --> 00:28:06.470]  Oh, and where did I get this?
[00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.852]  From her own book.
[00:28:09.794 --> 00:28:10.635]  Hard Choices.
[00:28:11.889 --> 00:28:18.595]  And she says she bonded with him for hours in his inner sanctum in a secret meeting that she only revealed in the book.
[00:28:18.935 --> 00:28:23.559]  So Hillary Clinton, while she's at the State Department, is having secret, unsanctioned
[00:28:25.856 --> 00:28:30.458]  Violations of the Logan Act, and then Trump does it all officially and correctly, and he's the traitor.
[00:28:30.998 --> 00:28:32.098]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:32.639 --> 00:28:34.639]  We'll go over all this when we come back.
[00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:40.441]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today, PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:28:51.085 --> 00:28:52.806]  We are the tip of the spear, he was the tip of the spear.
[00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:54.047]  Now take action!
[00:28:54.447 --> 00:28:57.049]  We cannot be stopped as long as God's on our side.
[00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:06.455]  Alex Jones here with unbelievably critical information concerning the future of our Republic.
[00:29:07.095 --> 00:29:14.660]  A year and a half ago, just a few months into President Trump being in office, the globalists panicked because the economy began to turn around.
[00:29:16.942 --> 00:29:21.144]  Former Obama administration officials, former deputy heads of the
[00:29:22.253 --> 00:29:29.535]  Defense Department and others went to the Pentagon and to Congress and were even in major news publications like Atlantic Monthly.
[00:29:30.512 --> 00:29:37.877]  Developing a public plan for a military coup against the president or a 25th amendment removal.
[00:29:38.738 --> 00:29:46.142]  I covered it at the time and mainstream corporate media attacked me and said it wasn't true because they didn't want to have major attention on it.
[00:29:46.223 --> 00:29:49.785]  They only wanted it in establishment publications like Atlantic Monthly.
[00:29:50.105 --> 00:29:52.347]  They did not want to be seen by the general public.
[00:29:52.367 --> 00:29:54.528]  They didn't want to have a debate about it early on.
[00:29:54.768 --> 00:30:00.412]  They wanted to build their false case over the next year or so and then make their move on the president.
[00:30:01.173 --> 00:30:03.274]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're now making that move.
[00:30:03.394 --> 00:30:09.780]  In the last 24 hours, we've seen the former head of the CIA Brennan say that Trump is nothing short of treasonous.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.241]  When it's Brennan that's the traitor.
[00:30:11.761 --> 00:30:17.206]  Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee has said that the military needs to take him out.
[00:30:17.326 --> 00:30:17.946]  Where are they?
[00:30:18.246 --> 00:30:19.147]  Needs to remove them.
[00:30:19.768 --> 00:30:23.331]  Phil Mudd, former deputy director of the CIA and the FBI,
[00:30:23.971 --> 00:30:24.471]  We're good to go.
[00:30:49.878 --> 00:30:52.720]  And the globalists know that as everything we've talked about
[00:31:11.305 --> 00:31:11.385]  It's

[00:32:14.784 --> 00:32:16.646]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven ourselves.
[00:32:16.686 --> 00:32:17.627]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:32:17.667 --> 00:32:20.529]  And we have this great crew standing in the face of this.
[00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:27.495]  And we have you, the listeners, and the viewers that support us, that make it possible, that pray for us, that share the articles and videos, and amplify our work.
[00:32:27.815 --> 00:32:28.716]  You are the InfoWarp.
[00:32:29.196 --> 00:32:41.507]  Americana and true freedom and true Western civilization and true Christianity is the light of the world and we're bringing it back into the world boldly and the enemy is attacking us because they know we have the answer.
[00:32:41.767 --> 00:32:44.890]  We have the light in the dark of the night and so do all of you.
[00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.031]  So I ask you today
[00:32:46.351 --> 00:32:48.132]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:33.976 --> 00:33:37.858]  We now take you live to the front lines of the fight to restore the republic.
[00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:46.642]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:47.062 --> 00:33:55.006]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:56.027 --> 00:34:00.709]  The amount of demonization and attacks that Infowars is under is absolutely exponential.
[00:34:02.225 --> 00:34:04.308]  And it's because the globalists know we're paying attention.
[00:34:04.348 --> 00:34:05.489]  They know we have memories.
[00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:08.333]  They know we're pointing out their lies in real time.
[00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:09.734]  But I'll tell you something.
[00:34:11.757 --> 00:34:13.719]  I put a story out yesterday with Kit Daniels.
[00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:15.081]  I shot a special report.
[00:34:15.541 --> 00:34:16.523]  Roger Stone covered it.
[00:34:18.902 --> 00:34:35.190]  The story got picked up all over the internet, but no one else from Breitbart to the Daily Caller to Tucker Carlson, and I'm going to send him a text message with the article, has picked it up when it's so dynamite, it's so critical.
[00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:42.193]  Hillary Clinton has come out and said she believes the Russians are going to steal the 2018 election.
[00:34:44.941 --> 00:34:54.789]  With no proof, and then she wants Obama's executive order, not rescinded by President Trump, protested by all 50 state attorney generals.
[00:34:56.171 --> 00:34:57.812]  That was even in the Hill newspaper last year.
[00:34:58.713 --> 00:35:00.935]  Letters signed by all 50 AGs.
[00:35:00.975 --> 00:35:01.836]  You ever heard of that happening?
[00:35:01.856 --> 00:35:06.960]  20-something of them Democrat, saying, no, we don't want this executive order implemented.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.463]  It's total federalization by Homeland Security.
[00:35:14.206 --> 00:35:17.948]  They're talking about TSA running the election facilities.
[00:35:18.268 --> 00:35:18.769]  I'm not kidding.
[00:35:19.989 --> 00:35:23.612]  Notice TSA has already been hired to do proms and high school and college football games.
[00:35:23.632 --> 00:35:34.678]  They actually say, Homeland Security, using the TSA and other systems, federal marshals, will come into all your local voting facilities and make sure the Russians don't steal it.
[00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:35.619]  Oh ho!
[00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:37.840]  And you go, oh that's okay, Trump's in power.
[00:35:38.421 --> 00:35:39.401]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:41.042]  It's a separation of powers is there.
[00:35:41.803 --> 00:35:42.863]  It's the federalist system.
[00:35:43.063 --> 00:35:43.824]  It's violating that.
[00:35:44.912 --> 00:35:45.773]  Between state and federal.
[00:35:47.054 --> 00:35:48.095]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:35:48.215 --> 00:35:48.876]  It's insane.
[00:35:49.176 --> 00:35:50.037]  It's super dangerous.
[00:35:50.097 --> 00:35:51.338]  It gets rid of checks and balances.
[00:35:51.558 --> 00:35:52.919]  It allows centralized fraud.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.263]  And we caught Hillary breaking into, what, five different states?
[00:35:57.303 --> 00:35:58.224]  They caught her and blocked her?
[00:35:59.405 --> 00:35:59.625]  No, no.
[00:35:59.685 --> 00:36:01.186]  She stole five states.
[00:36:01.467 --> 00:36:02.447]  They blocked her at six.
[00:36:02.467 --> 00:36:09.253]  Remember State Attorney Generals came out and said, yeah, we caught Homeland Security breaking into computers trying to flip it for Hillary.
[00:36:09.574 --> 00:36:10.695]  This all came out!
[00:36:15.089 --> 00:36:18.552]  So, that's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:20.573 --> 00:36:24.376]  Obama signed an executive order attempting to federalize elections.
[00:36:24.396 --> 00:36:26.097]  When they talk about protecting them, that's what they're doing.
[00:36:26.137 --> 00:36:31.001]  They mean taking them over like Venezuela, so you never have another real election again.
[00:36:31.461 --> 00:36:31.882]  There it is.
[00:36:32.282 --> 00:36:34.043]  Obama regime moves to federalize elections.
[00:36:34.664 --> 00:36:35.905]  So, you can also type it in.
[00:36:36.405 --> 00:36:41.549]  All 50 Attorney Generals, State Attorney Generals, shine letter saying, do not implement this, to Trump.
[00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:46.130]  But Trump's so busy, so much is going on, how can he keep track of it all?
[00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.551]  We have to make it a big issue.
[00:36:47.591 --> 00:36:48.351]  We have to hammer it.
[00:36:48.371 --> 00:36:56.716]  So Hillary says, in the speech she gave, we're going to play some of it here in a moment, that she slams Trump at Ozzy Fest.
[00:36:56.756 --> 00:36:59.958]  That's not Ozzy Osbourne, it's some man-hater event.
[00:37:00.398 --> 00:37:06.222]  Hillary claims Trump has compromised and the Russians are going to steal the election.
[00:37:07.202 --> 00:37:11.045]  She knows the blue wave is bye-bye.
[00:37:12.665 --> 00:37:28.391]  And she knows that America is awake and she knows with Sanders and Cortez running around saying we're going to have socialism and communism and we're going to have free health care and free schooling and free this and free that, that people know Venezuela doesn't work, fundamentally.
[00:37:29.191 --> 00:37:32.833]  Our own crony capitalist system's got its own problems, but a lot does trickle down.
[00:37:32.993 --> 00:37:33.993]  Just look at all the wealth.
[00:37:35.474 --> 00:37:37.334]  Are there a bunch of rich kingpins that own it all?
[00:37:37.614 --> 00:37:41.356]  Yeah, but they own the facilities and the structures we live in.
[00:37:42.762 --> 00:37:46.163]  And by the way, almost all those billionaires are globalists because they want to consolidate power.
[00:37:47.944 --> 00:37:53.126]  So they've got all the Democrats running around saying, stop it Cortez, stop it Sanders, stop taking us to the left.
[00:37:53.486 --> 00:37:55.507]  You've always been communists, you've always been socialists.
[00:37:55.827 --> 00:37:56.947]  They're making their move.
[00:37:57.587 --> 00:37:58.528]  This is what they want.
[00:37:59.508 --> 00:38:00.648]  They want free stuff now.
[00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:02.349]  These aren't smart people.
[00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:03.789]  Their constituents aren't smart.
[00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.831]  So Hillary comes out and says, you met with Putin
[00:38:10.782 --> 00:38:25.252]  Even though it was a sanctioned event, and you're the president, but when she was in the State Department, she violated the Logan Act and secretly met with him on multiple occasions, and then put it in her book like, oh, I met with him privately about Siberian tigers in his home.
[00:38:25.572 --> 00:38:26.233]  Clearly the cover.
[00:38:27.473 --> 00:38:31.896]  Meanwhile, it turns out, even the New York Times, an article titled, Hillary's Russia Problem, 2015,
[00:38:36.391 --> 00:38:48.854]  That she was there getting concessions for her husband and she approached the State Department for waivers so that Bill Clinton could make the deal in 2011 and 2012 for Uranium One.
[00:38:48.874 --> 00:38:52.835]  20 plus percent of our strategic high-grade Uranium.
[00:38:54.355 --> 00:38:58.596]  And who delivered them the sample that same year as the deal was made in 2011?
[00:38:58.656 --> 00:38:59.137]  Robert Mueller.
[00:39:05.731 --> 00:39:11.216]  Little Saint Bernard doggie, you know, that goes around delivering things in the dark of the night.
[00:39:13.015 --> 00:39:13.635]  So there you go.
[00:39:14.056 --> 00:39:14.676]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:39:14.696 --> 00:39:24.304]  No one will ever suspect him of Russian collusion, because why, he's the man running the Inquisition of the evil Tea Party and America First people that hate communism and are nationalists.
[00:39:24.344 --> 00:39:24.544]  Why?
[00:39:24.784 --> 00:39:26.085]  We're the ones you can't trust.
[00:39:26.305 --> 00:39:35.412]  You can trust Brennan, the admitted member of the Communist Party, not just in college, but when he got out of college, when he joined the CIA, and he admits, I'm a communist.
[00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:36.413]  Don't believe me?
[00:39:36.473 --> 00:39:37.314]  Go to WikiLeaks.
[00:39:38.374 --> 00:39:39.255]  Go to Wikipedia.
[00:39:39.495 --> 00:39:45.617]  There's New York Times articles about how much Obama loves him because they have the same policies.
[00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:49.858]  Brennan says he is a communist.
[00:39:52.579 --> 00:39:53.039]  And Brennan
[00:39:54.528 --> 00:40:00.311]  Still has his security clearance and still has access at the highest levels to the NSA and all of your data as the former CIA director.
[00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:05.713]  And today, Senator Rand Paul will meet with the President and ask to revoke John Brennan's security clearance.
[00:40:05.753 --> 00:40:14.517]  By the way, if people don't believe me, just type in, the neocons' biggest anti-Russia attack dog is a communist.
[00:40:15.077 --> 00:40:16.498]  And you'll get mainstream news articles.
[00:40:16.518 --> 00:40:16.938]  There it is.
[00:40:17.378 --> 00:40:20.119]  America's leading neocon attack dog was a communist.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.961]  He's just a villain, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:26.001]  Here are the articles.
[00:40:38.413 --> 00:40:39.094]  That was her cover.
[00:40:39.574 --> 00:40:44.478]  So I went and looked it all up and there it was, her getting her husband to meet with Putin six times over the uranium.
[00:40:44.658 --> 00:40:46.239]  Them getting hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.101]  Unbelievable.
[00:40:48.501 --> 00:41:04.895]  In the WikiLeaks, Hillary bragged about being invited to Putin's inner sanctum in his home, where she stayed the night when she was the Secretary of State.
[00:41:06.536 --> 00:41:07.137]  All secret.
[00:41:08.075 --> 00:41:14.539]  And then, years later, to cover her butt, she puts it in her book about, we've talked about tigers and bunny rabbits.
[00:41:17.521 --> 00:41:18.621]  Bragged about being invited.
[00:41:18.942 --> 00:41:23.985]  Bill Clinton sought state's permission to meet with Russian nuclear officials during Obama uranium decision.
[00:41:24.005 --> 00:41:24.025]  2010-2011.
[00:41:25.285 --> 00:41:25.626]  Look at that!
[00:41:29.261 --> 00:41:30.282]  Everything they say.
[00:41:30.302 --> 00:41:32.683]  People just go, oh, uranium, Hillary, uranium, Hillary.
[00:41:33.003 --> 00:41:34.064]  Look at the details!
[00:41:34.504 --> 00:41:35.925]  Staying at Putin's house!
[00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:38.226]  Sleeping in his guest bedroom!
[00:41:39.727 --> 00:41:41.728]  The Clintons were, like, in Russia half the time!
[00:41:42.448 --> 00:41:45.450]  Clinton Foundation shattered with State Department a uranium deal with Russia!
[00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:46.671]  WikiLeaks!
[00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:51.934]  Hillary Clinton says that you can't trust Trump.
[00:41:52.014 --> 00:41:52.974]  He's an asset.
[00:41:53.014 --> 00:41:55.676]  He's an agent of Putin for having an official meeting.
[00:41:58.143 --> 00:41:59.603]  Isn't that unbelievable?
[00:42:00.984 --> 00:42:05.265]  But that's how they operate, and that's how dumb they think you are, and then no one even cares.
[00:42:05.305 --> 00:42:08.946]  In the news cycle, everyone is obsessed with whatever's new.
[00:42:09.806 --> 00:42:15.988]  So, here we are in plain view of them trying to take over the election, saying the Russians are going to do it again, when they didn't do it in the first place.
[00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.862]  The Russians did come get uranium.
[00:42:19.062 --> 00:42:22.164]  Hell, if we're going to sell it to them and we got traitors in the government, that's what's going to happen.
[00:42:22.484 --> 00:42:23.804]  Like Putin said, he respects Trump.
[00:42:23.844 --> 00:42:24.665]  Trump is for U.S.
[00:42:24.705 --> 00:42:24.965]  interests.
[00:42:25.665 --> 00:42:27.326]  Putin is for Russian interests.
[00:42:27.767 --> 00:42:31.749]  There's a lot of respect there because Trump isn't a traitor, and the Russians respect that.
[00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:35.691]  Our country has had America's legs all the way back behind our ears.
[00:42:36.371 --> 00:42:47.217]  Pimping us out to the whole world, and it's trying to come to an end, so the traitors like Brennan and Hillary, all these dirtbag communists, everybody else in Soros, a Nazi collaborator, this is the Legion of Doom that runs our world?
[00:42:47.457 --> 00:42:51.599]  Let's get this scum out and have a new time of prosperity and freedom!
[00:42:51.639 --> 00:42:54.881]  We're that close to exercising these people, and they're pissed!
[00:42:55.221 --> 00:42:56.722]  We'll be back with Critical Intel.
[00:42:56.782 --> 00:42:57.222]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.824 --> 00:43:03.967]  This country is now officially in a state of civil war.
[00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:12.754]  Multiple members of Congress, rabid Democrats, have called for a military coup against President Donald J. Trump.
[00:43:13.194 --> 00:43:22.201]  We also have former Deputy Director of the FBI and Deputy Director of the CIA coming out and calling for the, quote, deep state to remove the President.
[00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:30.507]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you saw that going on in Russia, our news media would accurately say that they were in a state of civil war.
[00:43:30.807 --> 00:43:34.289]  If you saw that happening in the EU, that would be an accurate assumption.
[00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:41.635]  Even a few weeks ago, USA Today interviewed professors that said they believe we were already in the early stages of a civil war.
[00:43:42.535 --> 00:43:52.322]  I have been ridiculed for pointing out that Democrats the last year and a half were quietly planning it in their own policy papers funded by George Soros and others.
[00:43:52.642 --> 00:43:56.465]  But now it's out in the open and this country is in maximum danger.
[00:43:57.085 --> 00:44:04.311]  They are trying to induce Trump derangement syndrome onto CNN and MSNBC and NPR audiences.
[00:44:05.191 --> 00:44:22.423]  To believe the hysteria that Russia wants to build walls, that Russia wants to expand our military, that Russia wants to bring our economy back, that Russia wants to devastate its own oil and gas imports as Trump has done, that Russia wants Trump to ship anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to attack Russians?
[00:44:23.163 --> 00:44:28.206]  The truth is, Trump's been too hardcore on Russia because Russia hasn't done anything to the U.S.
[00:44:28.727 --> 00:44:34.751]  It's the communist Chinese that are on record owning Hollywood, owning our national debt, and trying to basically break this country up.
[00:44:35.051 --> 00:44:36.372]  They're allied with the Democrats.
[00:44:36.672 --> 00:44:37.492]  They're the real traitors.
[00:44:37.933 --> 00:44:49.340]  That's why Congressman Stephen Cohen has called for a military coup against the president because he is a traitor working with the chi-coms, working with the multinational corporations.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:57.983]  That's why Phil Mudd of the CIA and the FBI has come out on CNN just last night and said Trump is a traitor.
[00:44:58.043 --> 00:45:06.145]  He needs to be overthrown for meeting with the Russian leader and being nice, at least in the things he said, but not in Trump's actions.
[00:45:06.285 --> 00:45:06.905]  It's incredible.
[00:45:07.345 --> 00:45:16.408]  And then we've got, of course, Rabid Wolf Blitzer attacking Senator Rand Paul for pointing out that Trump's just trying to stop a new Cold War from taking place.
[00:45:16.468 --> 00:45:18.869]  And then former CIA Director Brennan
[00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:24.111]  Who's a Wahhabist, who was an admitted communist in college, voted as a communist after he was in college.
[00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:29.974]  This anti-American piece of garbage has been caught illegally spying on the president back when he was in the campaign.
[00:45:30.014 --> 00:45:32.795]  Then once he was president-elect, he's been caught lying to Congress.
[00:45:33.175 --> 00:45:40.078]  This guy is saying that Trump is treasonous and that Trump needs to be politically paralyzed and removed.
[00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:41.119]  They want
[00:45:42.597 --> 00:45:48.319]  25th Amendment invoked, and they're calling for people inside Trump's cabinet to call for him to be removed.
[00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:50.680]  This isn't just a civil war they've kicked off.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:46:05.385]  It is an attempted coup that is in plain view, and the public and everyone else must respond by calling Congress, calling the president, and calling other individuals in our government and telling them, stand by the election, stand by the voters, stand by the republic.
[00:46:05.745 --> 00:46:07.245]  My goodness, the country's coming back.
[00:46:07.346 --> 00:46:08.526]  So many great things are happening.
[00:46:08.746 --> 00:46:11.467]  We're making the nation great again, and these traitors can't stand it.
[00:46:11.807 --> 00:46:14.791]  That said, InfoWars is under unprecedented attack as well.
[00:46:15.252 --> 00:46:18.796]  As you see thousands of articles a week saying, shut us down, take us off the air.
[00:46:19.137 --> 00:46:27.187]  Without you spreading the word, the articles, the videos, without you buying products at InfoWarsStore.com, they will defeat us as a key outpost in the fight against globalism.
[00:46:27.227 --> 00:46:27.948]  Spread the article.
[00:46:27.988 --> 00:46:28.888]  Spread the videos.
[00:46:29.128 --> 00:46:33.592]  Subscribe to the new official InfoWars app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.

[00:46:35.033 --> 00:46:39.196]  Spread our articles to everyone you know continually as an act of resistance against the globalists.
[00:46:39.356 --> 00:46:47.722]  And financially buy the equivalent of Information Warfare war bonds at InfoWarsStore.com when you buy products that will empower you and your family.
[00:46:47.782 --> 00:46:51.265]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've backed InfoWars for more than 20 years and I want to thank you all.
[00:46:51.485 --> 00:46:57.106]  But now it's more critical than ever to go to InfoWarStore.com and support the InfoWar while getting great products.
[00:46:57.366 --> 00:46:58.186]  God bless you all.
[00:47:03.667 --> 00:47:06.328]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.663 --> 00:47:28.386]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:31.347 --> 00:47:39.791]  Alright folks, we've got a bunch of guests coming up that I haven't even told you about, and so much other news, but let me just make this point infinity clear.
[00:47:40.851 --> 00:47:43.332]  Let me just make this point absolutely sterling.
[00:47:44.634 --> 00:48:02.421]  InfoWars' job is taking critical intel, whether it be breaking news, secret information, controversial info, or old info that nobody's paying attention to, and ramming it out there, and blowing a hole into the news cycle, and making people cover it.
[00:48:03.302 --> 00:48:04.663]  And that's why they hate us.
[00:48:05.363 --> 00:48:18.991]  Because time and time again, because of you, the audience, being activist and being involved in spreading the word by mouth and by email and by Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and calling in to talk radio and C-SPAN and going to Clinton events and getting in their face, legally and lawfully.
[00:48:19.612 --> 00:48:20.512]  You're changing the world.
[00:48:20.552 --> 00:48:22.113]  They're scared of your activism.
[00:48:22.553 --> 00:48:23.514]  They're scared of your will.
[00:48:24.695 --> 00:48:30.078]  Hillary Clinton admittedly met in secret with Putin repeatedly.
[00:48:31.567 --> 00:48:36.229]  She got waivers for Bill Clinton to make uranium deals with him, and now it's coming out.
[00:48:37.049 --> 00:48:38.270]  And you say, yeah, we already know that.
[00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:43.592]  But the big news is she said Trump can't be trusted for a sanctioned legal meeting with Putin.
[00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:45.423]  And that he's a traitor.
[00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:47.784]  That the election should be taken over by the Democrats.
[00:48:48.204 --> 00:49:02.334]  So then you point out that she literally met with him illegally and secretly and violated the Logan Act and we have all the proof from her own book, Hard Choices, and then the State Department record where they had to get waivers to do it because that was illegal!
[00:49:04.537 --> 00:49:05.677]  And who ran the State Department?
[00:49:05.717 --> 00:49:06.078]  She did!
[00:49:06.118 --> 00:49:11.760]  So she ordered her underlings to give her husband waivers for hundreds of millions of dollars of weapons-grade U.S.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.621]  uranium, and Robert Mueller delivered the sample!
[00:49:15.501 --> 00:49:20.543]  That's right out of a James Bond movie, where you catch Spectre doing bad stuff!
[00:49:24.004 --> 00:49:26.925]  And so it needs to be covered.
[00:49:28.134 --> 00:49:32.578]  Paul tweeted it yesterday, I tweeted it today, I tweeted it again yesterday.
[00:49:32.658 --> 00:49:35.741]  Just get the articles and get it out to everybody.
[00:49:36.081 --> 00:49:37.903]  And I don't care if InfoWars gets the credit.
[00:49:38.944 --> 00:49:46.471]  There's Breitbart articles from a year and a half ago, InfoWars articles from a year and a half ago, two years ago, videos we did with Owen Schroer two years ago.
[00:49:47.431 --> 00:49:48.833]  I don't care about the credit.
[00:49:49.173 --> 00:49:50.975]  I want these criminals stopped.
[00:49:51.375 --> 00:49:53.117]  I want these traitors out of our country.
[00:49:53.437 --> 00:49:54.498]  I want them off our back!
[00:49:57.611 --> 00:49:59.772]  So, talk radio, everybody.
[00:49:59.852 --> 00:50:01.453]  This is bombshell.
[00:50:02.273 --> 00:50:05.235]  But again, they just wear you out with, everybody knows Hillary was with the Russians.
[00:50:05.515 --> 00:50:06.676]  This is all a big scam.
[00:50:06.816 --> 00:50:07.256]  I know!
[00:50:08.236 --> 00:50:11.758]  But she says Trump has been caught red-handed.
[00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:15.200]  Because he had a public meeting, that means he's a traitor.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.601]  And Brennan calls it treason.
[00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:21.743]  When these guys literally sold us out to the Russians and the Chinese a hundred times that, literally.
[00:50:23.824 --> 00:50:25.385]  The article's on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:25.565 --> 00:50:26.386]  Get it out, folks.
[00:50:27.363 --> 00:50:28.544]  I had it reposted from yesterday.
[00:50:28.584 --> 00:50:31.086]  It's just our article, boiling it down, showing the history of it.
[00:50:32.027 --> 00:50:33.328]  And it's even worse than we say.
[00:50:34.289 --> 00:50:41.676]  Most of the time I read our articles, I get mad because there's so much even more proof, but you just... It's dizzying, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:41.816 --> 00:50:43.918]  I'm looking at the State Department record here in my hand.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:50.344]  And then John Brennan, an admitted communist, anti-Wahhabist, any evil group, he goes and joins it.
[00:50:50.684 --> 00:50:52.706]  Former head of the CIA that sold the country out to everybody.
[00:50:53.086 --> 00:50:53.827]  He then says,
[00:50:56.058 --> 00:50:57.899]  That Trump is a traitor?
[00:51:02.102 --> 00:51:04.023]  By the way, I'm not just loyal to Trump.
[00:51:04.123 --> 00:51:09.506]  I'm loyal to the fact that Trump keeps telling the truth and taking action and doing a great job and being attacked.
[00:51:09.546 --> 00:51:11.888]  And I've been persecuted for standing up for Trump and the truth.
[00:51:12.848 --> 00:51:14.850]  And it just makes it that much more precious.
[00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:19.513]  The more I get attacked, it doesn't make me want to let go.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:29.003]  The more I pay for this, and the more I see us actually turning around, I am absolutely so honored to be in this position.
[00:51:29.923 --> 00:51:31.264]  I am extremely honored to be here.
[00:51:31.344 --> 00:51:32.664]  I'm very thankful to all of you.
[00:51:33.325 --> 00:51:34.625]  And I just thank you for your prayers.
[00:51:34.845 --> 00:51:39.727]  And I was up in Omaha visiting my wife's family for a couple days.
[00:51:39.747 --> 00:51:41.768]  Her dad's been sick, but he's doing good now.
[00:51:42.508 --> 00:51:43.369]  So she wanted to go visit him.
[00:51:43.669 --> 00:51:46.310]  He had heart surgery recently.
[00:51:48.228 --> 00:51:50.849]  I just got mobbed by these great-looking families.
[00:51:51.169 --> 00:51:53.629]  Hispanic, black, white, old, young, Native American.
[00:51:54.029 --> 00:51:55.069]  Mobbed at the airport.
[00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:57.610]  And just great people.
[00:51:58.330 --> 00:51:58.930]  Great people.
[00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.671]  And it was just so good to run into all of them.
[00:52:02.011 --> 00:52:05.191]  And I'm not going to let those folks down.
[00:52:05.211 --> 00:52:06.312]  I'm not going to let my children down.
[00:52:06.352 --> 00:52:07.452]  I'm not going to let your children down.
[00:52:07.472 --> 00:52:09.032]  I'm going to do the best job I can.
[00:52:10.632 --> 00:52:13.113]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up here, because there's just so much.
[00:52:16.536 --> 00:52:23.399]  Mike Cernovich, I should have told you right at the start of the show, obviously, Deep Six, the pedo fanboy.
[00:52:23.519 --> 00:52:27.662]  We don't know if he has sex with children, but let's print a bunch of those off.
[00:52:27.802 --> 00:52:34.325]  The guy that directed Guardians of the Galaxy, I guess made his bones on Twitter talking about how great it is to have sex with children.
[00:52:35.065 --> 00:52:40.408]  And then a bunch of comedians came out and defended him, and then we went and looked at their Twitters, and they all say, hey,
[00:52:41.494 --> 00:52:44.037]  Let kids have sex with adults, that way they won't get kidnapped and killed.
[00:52:44.057 --> 00:52:45.258]  That's an AMBLA statement.
[00:52:46.039 --> 00:52:53.486]  And so they're saying Cernovich is bad because he said, date rape doesn't exist if a woman later says that you didn't force her but she didn't consent.
[00:52:54.067 --> 00:52:56.329]  That's just feminist garbage saying all sex is rape.
[00:52:56.649 --> 00:53:05.318]  They then call Cernovich a rapist, when clearly the type of date rape he's talking about where a woman just says, I didn't give consent but I didn't stop him, that's not rape.
[00:53:06.653 --> 00:53:08.234]  And so what he's pointing out is the truth.
[00:53:08.494 --> 00:53:12.917]  It lessens real rape, and then it lessens people saying they want to have sex with children.
[00:53:14.238 --> 00:53:17.281]  And then meanwhile, they go, oh, he's a Pizzagate reporter.
[00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:22.704]  He reported on the New York Times, the Washington Post, distracting off of the
[00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:33.454]  Jerry Epstein, Lolita Express airplane with Bill Clinton on it, and Weiner, and the laptops, and the state police reports.
[00:53:34.035 --> 00:53:38.058]  We broke here that it had little girls naked and all the rest of it before it was even in the news.
[00:53:39.379 --> 00:53:42.642]  Former head of Blackwater, current head of XC, came out and said the same thing.
[00:53:44.984 --> 00:53:45.564]  Eric Prince.
[00:53:47.706 --> 00:53:50.828]  And they distracted onto the pizza place and got us to cover it.
[00:53:51.849 --> 00:53:53.911]  And then said, oh look, they're wrong about the pizza place.
[00:53:53.971 --> 00:53:54.912]  Classic bait and switch.
[00:53:55.152 --> 00:53:56.253]  You learn how this stuff works.
[00:53:59.107 --> 00:53:59.987]  But now we're on to it.
[00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:03.169]  But then they go, oh look, this credited Pizzagate.
[00:54:03.469 --> 00:54:09.272]  So they use Pizzagate like pedophilia doesn't exist, but it's all over the place, record buster happening, and they don't know what to do.
[00:54:11.613 --> 00:54:14.194]  So, you've got all these people defending James Gunn.
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:17.701]  Mike Cernovich coming up.
[00:54:18.701 --> 00:54:23.765]  Then we have the editor of Westminster coming on to talk about this subject and then Lionel.
[00:54:24.145 --> 00:54:26.307]  Now let me tell you what I've got here.
[00:54:26.627 --> 00:54:28.668]  And when you read this you think, oh that's just cute.
[00:54:29.209 --> 00:54:30.350]  It's on newswars.com.
[00:54:32.351 --> 00:54:34.933]  Sweden teaching migrants how to have sex with blondes.
[00:54:36.311 --> 00:54:37.292]  It's actual cuckolding.
[00:54:37.472 --> 00:54:40.754]  It's the plan to repopulate Europe with North Africa and the Middle East.
[00:54:41.294 --> 00:54:42.355]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:54:42.995 --> 00:54:48.399]  And actually teach 14-year-old girls in after-school specials how to have an older boyfriend and make sure he's a Muslim.
[00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.500]  And they have UN ads telling women how to wear hijabs.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.742]  And they take the kids to mosque and tell them how to pray.
[00:54:55.643 --> 00:55:01.087]  So this is what goes on in Sweden, and it says Sweden teaching migrants how to have sex with blondes.
[00:55:01.447 --> 00:55:02.348]  It dovetails with this.
[00:55:02.548 --> 00:55:03.749]  One killed, 14 wounded.
[00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:05.490]  Government opens fire in Toronto.
[00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:07.431]  Terrorism suspected, so you won't hear about it anymore.
[00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:11.714]  Three men arrested after acid attack on three-year-old British boy.
[00:55:13.175 --> 00:55:17.298]  Dirty, stinking Belgian migrants gang pelt handicapped old lady with stones.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.742]  This is what is going on.
[00:55:22.782 --> 00:55:23.622]  So that's all coming up.
[00:55:23.682 --> 00:55:24.583]  Now let me stop right there.
[00:55:26.314 --> 00:55:38.766]  I hardly plug, and it's my fault, but we've not even been bringing in the capital we need lately to continue operating at this level into the future, just because I've been so busy focused on news and information that I've not even been promoting our products.
[00:55:39.026 --> 00:55:40.267]  I've not even been cutting new ads.
[00:55:40.547 --> 00:55:42.089]  As everybody knows, I'm just totally in the war.
[00:55:43.075 --> 00:55:53.842]  I need everybody to go to MFORSTORE.COM and sign up for auto-ship on the great high-quality organic coffee we have, on things like X2 or the multivitamins, or all the great products, things that you're going to need continually.
[00:55:54.142 --> 00:55:59.346]  Just go sign up, get a 10% discount on top of it, and then get great products at MFORSTORE.COM.
[00:55:59.366 --> 00:56:02.328]  We also have Patriot Points that are 5% on every dollar.
[00:56:03.803 --> 00:56:05.405]  Those really add up as well.
[00:56:06.186 --> 00:56:09.770]  Now, we have to end this special today because we've got some new specials we're going to launch tomorrow.
[00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:13.954]  But this is, and I keep saying is the biggest, is the biggest, we just keep escalating the sales.
[00:56:14.895 --> 00:56:18.179]  Defeat the globalist plan to censorship and shut down InfoWars.
[00:56:18.499 --> 00:56:18.819]  Special.
[00:56:19.793 --> 00:56:25.355]  The biggest specials are 67% off, the average specials 50% off, and free shipping.
[00:56:25.395 --> 00:56:31.337]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:31.817 --> 00:56:33.037]  Also, download the free app.
[00:56:33.697 --> 00:56:36.318]  The last app had some problems with some people's phones.
[00:56:36.338 --> 00:56:36.898]  We got rid of it.
[00:56:38.159 --> 00:56:38.939]  This one is free.
[00:56:39.519 --> 00:56:40.260]  It works great.
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:40.880]  It's wonderful.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.020]  It's the Infowars official.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.121]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[00:56:45.181 --> 00:56:57.747]  And it's got so many features, I'm not going to go into them all, but everybody needs this and it's a great way to get your neighbors and friends and family and or distant relatives or co-workers or your boss or your employees, your pastor, your flocker, whoever, to listen.
[00:56:57.787 --> 00:56:59.048]  Say, hey, here's the forbidden info.
[00:56:59.268 --> 00:57:00.308]  Here's what they don't want you to hear.
[00:57:00.588 --> 00:57:01.749]  Find out why he's so attacked.
[00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:02.869]  Find out why he's so demonized.
[00:57:03.209 --> 00:57:05.611]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[00:57:05.991 --> 00:57:07.732]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[00:57:07.812 --> 00:57:08.712]  And that's really the power.
[00:57:08.712 --> 00:57:08.932]  I don't
[00:57:25.655 --> 00:57:31.559]  Whatever you do, go to InfoWarsStore.com and check out the thousands of great products, the supplements, the t-shirts, all of it.
[00:57:31.759 --> 00:57:34.081]  A lot of new great t-shirts that are some of the best we've ever produced.
[00:57:34.441 --> 00:57:38.064]  Reelect 45, Mean Like a Wolverine, the new InfoWars logo.
[00:57:38.444 --> 00:57:41.886]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:42.367 --> 00:57:43.367]  You built InfoWars.
[00:57:43.828 --> 00:57:44.868]  Thank you so much for what you've done.
[00:57:44.949 --> 00:57:46.910]  Now we're facing the biggest fight of our lives.
[00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:48.311]  We need your support now more than ever.
[00:57:50.432 --> 00:57:51.093]  It's all happening.
[00:57:52.614 --> 00:57:53.695]  Trump is a nationalist.
[00:57:54.776 --> 00:57:55.708]  The country's coming back.
[00:57:57.401 --> 00:58:05.687]  The globalist forces in this country, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans, are openly saying they want to remove him through a military coup, or through the 25th Amendment.
[00:58:05.787 --> 00:58:06.727]  It's unbelievable.
[00:58:07.067 --> 00:58:08.108]  It's all happening right now.
[00:58:08.608 --> 00:58:18.055]  That's why it's more important than ever that every viewer, every listener, to local radio, to TV, or over the internet, understand, your voice isn't just critical, it's essential.
[00:58:18.755 --> 00:58:26.881]  If you don't stand up and speak out, and stand up against these bullies, and point out that it's the globalists that are the ones that sold out America, not Trump, and that they're the enemy,
[00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:28.181]  They're the traitors.
[00:58:28.942 --> 00:58:30.942]  They may be successful removing our president.
[00:58:31.263 --> 00:58:33.643]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:34.104 --> 00:58:38.966]  Trump is so real, he's so hardcore, and it's so unbelievable to see that we are at this point.
[00:58:39.246 --> 00:58:41.687]  We are in the middle of a second American Revolution.
[00:58:42.067 --> 00:58:44.768]  This time, not against King George III, but against the globalists.
[00:58:45.208 --> 00:58:49.333]  We're running a special for a week that is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[00:58:49.373 --> 00:58:51.936]  We just keep boosting the sales.
[00:58:52.316 --> 00:58:52.496]  67% off.
[00:58:52.697 --> 00:58:54.358]  Up to 67% off.
[00:58:54.438 --> 00:59:00.025]  It's Defeat the Democrat Slash Globalist Plan to Censor Infowars and the Web Super Sale.

[00:59:29.893 --> 00:59:30.253]  All of it.
[00:59:30.273 --> 00:59:32.135]  We're coming through the storm thanks to you.
[00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:33.516]  Shop with the good guys.
[00:59:33.776 --> 00:59:34.537]  Pay it forward.
[00:59:34.857 --> 00:59:38.740]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.122]  This is the battle for the future.
[00:59:41.482 --> 00:59:42.603]  This is the war for the future.
[00:59:42.964 --> 00:59:46.446]  And I need all of you to commit even more to this fight.
[00:59:46.767 --> 00:59:47.067]  Thank you.
[00:59:47.407 --> 00:59:48.768]  I'm counting on you, and I salute you.
[00:59:51.669 --> 00:59:57.632]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.756 --> 01:00:08.798]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.242]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:22.842 --> 01:00:31.424]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.384 --> 01:00:46.986]  Alright, Mike Cernovich is coming on with some of the most critical information we can cover if you want victory, and that's going through the Twitter pages of every major Democrat and liberal you know, because I'd say about half of them talk about how they like to have sex with kids.
[01:00:48.006 --> 01:00:50.707]  That's their religion, you don't get in the club at the high level.
[01:00:52.439 --> 01:00:59.124]  As a movie star, as a director particularly, Disney's been caught rehiring convicted child rapists that actually raped 10-year-old boys and girls.
[01:01:00.344 --> 01:01:01.145]  It's a cult out there.
[01:01:01.165 --> 01:01:03.907]  The average person doesn't believe it because we're not into that, you know.
[01:01:04.567 --> 01:01:05.988]  But these people are sick.
[01:01:06.568 --> 01:01:08.309]  And so Mike Cernovich has been exposing it.
[01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:09.170]  He's been demonized.
[01:01:10.111 --> 01:01:11.071]  He's coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:11.612 --> 01:01:15.514]  And they get a lot of so-called conservatives, libertarians want to get brownie points with the leftist media.
[01:01:15.554 --> 01:01:18.476]  They'll like join in and go, oh yeah, Cernovich is this or that.
[01:01:18.496 --> 01:01:21.318]  And then they'll go off some fake quote or some edited quote.
[01:01:22.797 --> 01:01:26.018]  But in this short segment, I want to address something right now because it ties into that.
[01:01:27.198 --> 01:01:29.119]  It ties into Matt Gaetz.
[01:01:30.579 --> 01:01:34.241]  I remember when Roger Stone was helping get Matt Gaetz elected a couple years ago.
[01:01:35.061 --> 01:01:36.621]  Matt Gaetz is a smart, articulate guy.
[01:01:36.661 --> 01:01:37.362]  He's been on the show.
[01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:38.962]  I like what he does.
[01:01:40.382 --> 01:01:51.466]  I've been trying to get Matt Gaetz to champion internet freedom and understand that these things are utilities, that they're selectively banning conservatives and libertarians, that they're shadowbanning the President's tweets, and that he could be a champion of that.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.181]  They have hearings last Tuesday.
[01:01:55.281 --> 01:02:05.727]  Gates sits there and listens to Google, Facebook, and Twitter, the YouTube subsidiary, say that I said no one died at Parkland and that my YouTube channel was taken down.
[01:02:08.748 --> 01:02:11.590]  Well, number one, it was taken down and put back up because I didn't say that.
[01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:12.811]  But even if I said that, it's my right.
[01:02:12.851 --> 01:02:13.331]  But I didn't.
[01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:15.692]  I said there was a police stand down, which was confirmed.
[01:02:15.792 --> 01:02:19.094]  And they didn't like that because we had kids on the show and then local news clips.
[01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.154]  We would show people shooting videos over a news camera that never made it on the news.
[01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:25.118]  So they were pissed about that.
[01:02:25.398 --> 01:02:27.241]  The videos had millions of views, they took them down.
[01:02:28.222 --> 01:02:33.250]  Then they said our video, I said that they were all crisis actors from California and that nobody died.
[01:02:33.491 --> 01:02:34.112]  I never said that!
[01:02:35.842 --> 01:02:44.826]  It was so painful, because I know Gates has been told that, that he went and did, I'm talking a hundred interviews or more, he was just, he was all over, he just, he did, he loved it.
[01:02:45.286 --> 01:02:50.528]  And he goes, oh yeah, Alex Jones is bad, but I think they should ban people that also threaten to hunt Republicans.
[01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:57.031]  And I confronted him on that, he said, you know, about how they leave up these sites saying, you know, good job killing, trying to kill Scalise.
[01:02:57.991 --> 01:02:59.412]  So he equated me with that.
[01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:07.979]  Threw me under the buzz mega massively, and then went along, and here he is quoted, Representative Matt Gaetz explains his InfoWars conversion.
[01:03:10.922 --> 01:03:22.513]  And then it's a weird headline, and then it just goes into it, and him saying, oh InfoWars is hurtful, InfoWars, you know, says things that are bad.
[01:03:26.186 --> 01:03:30.890]  And he goes on and says that content where he said Parkland students didn't die and bullied them has been taken down.
[01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.633]  And so all I'm asking is stuff saying kill Republicans, take that down too.
[01:03:34.973 --> 01:03:36.975]  So, man, he knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:03:37.015 --> 01:03:41.518]  He's calculated that going along with him, lying about me, will get him ahead.
[01:03:41.939 --> 01:03:43.860]  No, it won't, Gates.
[01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:46.042]  Here's another thing.
[01:03:46.062 --> 01:03:48.104]  Last time Rand Paul was on, he called and wanted to come on.
[01:03:48.144 --> 01:03:48.344]  Great.
[01:03:49.505 --> 01:03:54.228]  I've called staff, I want to give them the time of day, but I can call his house if I want to get him on, I can call his wife, I can get him on whenever I want.
[01:03:54.408 --> 01:03:57.070]  That doesn't give us ratings to have Rand Paul on, having Gates on.
[01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:58.410]  Nobody cared about his interview.
[01:03:59.051 --> 01:04:01.332]  They want to hear real people like Mike Cernovich and myself.
[01:04:02.033 --> 01:04:02.933]  So, here's the thing, Gates.
[01:04:03.614 --> 01:04:05.775]  I'm trying to educate you in Congress.
[01:04:06.095 --> 01:04:06.916]  I'm trying to inform you.
[01:04:07.036 --> 01:04:12.359]  I don't need you to give me your little magic wand, rinky-dinky decoder wheel thing.
[01:04:13.342 --> 01:04:15.085]  Dude, okay?
[01:04:15.405 --> 01:04:21.514]  So thanks a lot for lying about me and going along with that crap that I know you've been personally told isn't true.
[01:04:23.977 --> 01:04:26.120]  That I said nobody died at Parkland.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.105]  You might as well join the Southern Poverty Law Center or Snopes, buddy.
[01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:34.512]  Because if you're trying to make me angry, you are really doing a good job.
[01:04:35.052 --> 01:04:35.592]  But I get it.
[01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:41.755]  Throw somebody under the bus, police other conservatives, go along with the lies, and maybe the left will eat you last.
[01:04:42.135 --> 01:04:43.336]  You don't get leadership.
[01:04:43.656 --> 01:04:44.596]  You don't understand it.
[01:04:45.197 --> 01:04:46.217]  Like President Trump does.
[01:04:47.017 --> 01:04:48.478]  Well, why don't you throw him under the bus?
[01:04:48.858 --> 01:04:51.059]  They say he said all Mexicans are criminals.
[01:04:51.579 --> 01:04:52.320]  He never said it.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.381]  Why don't you just go along with those lies too, Gates?
[01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:56.762]  Thanks a lot, man.
[01:04:57.082 --> 01:04:57.742]  Thanks a lot.
[01:04:57.822 --> 01:04:59.583]  You look like a possum ate a pile of crap.
[01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:06.727]  Anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[01:05:07.367 --> 01:05:12.528]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[01:05:12.888 --> 01:05:19.570]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines.
[01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:23.471]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[01:05:24.231 --> 01:05:27.913]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[01:05:28.453 --> 01:05:29.633]  And my only message is this.
[01:05:29.874 --> 01:05:32.935]  Everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[01:05:33.775 --> 01:05:41.239]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[01:05:41.799 --> 01:05:44.620]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.560]  We already have the power.
[01:05:45.781 --> 01:05:50.703]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[01:05:51.523 --> 01:05:53.988]  InfoWars is on the front line and so are you!
[01:05:54.268 --> 01:05:55.530]  We are the resistance!
[01:06:11.588 --> 01:06:15.629]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.850]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:19.230]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:24.491]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.072 --> 01:06:30.253]  Mike Cernovich joins us for the hour.
[01:06:30.273 --> 01:06:37.115]  He's the best-selling author, documentary filmmaker, talk show host, and good friend of mine.
[01:06:38.143 --> 01:06:45.027]  He came out and exposed James Gunn, the director of many big films like Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2.
[01:06:46.768 --> 01:06:55.353]  He was fired after hundreds of tweets were discovered in public view by Mike Cernovich, InfoWars Paul Watson then magnified that.
[01:06:55.793 --> 01:06:59.155]  It got picked up a lot last week and he got fired by Disney.
[01:06:59.195 --> 01:07:04.979]  Disney is famous for hiring convicted pedophiles who have actually raped small children.
[01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:21.930]  To direct more films with children and they use the whole Me Too movement saying that basically a man asking a woman out is rape to smokescreen what Weinstein and the Lolita Express and Epstein and all the rest of the Clintons are really involved in.
[01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:25.694]  So you don't get in a club at the highest levels now
[01:07:27.425 --> 01:07:42.320]  You are not at least tacitly approving of the North American Man-Boy Love Association, NAMBLA agenda, which says let us have sex with your children, let them have age of consent, or that's what causes them to be kidnapped because people can't help themselves.
[01:07:43.203 --> 01:07:48.266]  And that's what some of the people that attacked Cernovich, so-called comedians and others, said.
[01:07:48.787 --> 01:07:52.049]  Oh yeah, and so this is a firestorm.
[01:07:52.129 --> 01:07:53.329]  And listen, we can't do all this.
[01:07:54.510 --> 01:08:01.335]  As I've said, if you just see a city council member who's a Democrat in a big city, or anywhere, go up and record them.
[01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:04.577]  Tell them you've got a kid you want them to have sex with.
[01:08:04.597 --> 01:08:05.197]  They'll want a bite.
[01:08:05.217 --> 01:08:06.118]  You can call the FBI.
[01:08:07.158 --> 01:08:09.520]  I'd say about half your Democrat leaders are pedophiles.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.260]  The others, no.
[01:08:12.329 --> 01:08:18.472]  Project Veritas, five, six years ago, would just walk into random acorns and say, I got an underage hooker.
[01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:20.133]  How do I run whores?
[01:08:20.153 --> 01:08:22.595]  And they said, we'll set it up for you right now.
[01:08:24.496 --> 01:08:33.781]  This year, they got video in New Jersey and in Illinois of the heads of teacher unions saying, yeah, we know teachers are having kids with the elementary students and others.
[01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:34.622]  We're just going to cover it up.
[01:08:35.299 --> 01:08:36.160]  They're going to get their pension.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:37.540]  We'll get them moved to another school.
[01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:38.821]  Just like the Catholic Church.
[01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:43.704]  It's a very small percentage, but they want power and they want access to your kids.
[01:08:43.985 --> 01:08:45.406]  So, Mike Cernovich is a hero.
[01:08:47.447 --> 01:08:52.810]  But, he hasn't been completely shadow-banned like real Alex Jones.
[01:08:53.691 --> 01:08:55.472]  Or Paul Watson's been partially shadow-banned.
[01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:56.453]  But now he is.
[01:08:56.493 --> 01:08:59.515]  You search Cernovich, you don't find any of him.
[01:08:59.555 --> 01:09:00.535]  You only find the attacks.
[01:09:00.815 --> 01:09:02.016]  He crossed the red line.
[01:09:02.036 --> 01:09:02.717]  So here's your headline.
[01:09:03.567 --> 01:09:13.310]  Investigative journalist Mike Cernovich shadow banned by Twitter for exposing pedophile worshipper James Gunn.
[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.791]  That's what I'd call him.
[01:09:15.391 --> 01:09:17.311]  Wow, that'll be good in Congress, won't it?
[01:09:17.711 --> 01:09:18.512]  So here's the deal.
[01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:23.473]  You learn where Jack Dorsey's heart is when you touch the big prize.
[01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:28.695]  And you gotta learn, ladies and gentlemen, you gotta learn.
[01:09:28.815 --> 01:09:31.856]  I've been in some big movies and I've been out in Hollywood and I got told by folks,
[01:09:33.223 --> 01:09:33.903]  Man, you don't understand.
[01:09:33.923 --> 01:09:37.884]  They're either into the occult, or they're into pedophilia, or they're into both.
[01:09:37.944 --> 01:09:38.884]  And he said it's bad.
[01:09:39.344 --> 01:09:40.845]  It's the majority of people at the top.
[01:09:41.185 --> 01:09:43.145]  Everybody else has to live under it and put up with it.
[01:09:43.545 --> 01:09:44.746]  And it's totally out of control.
[01:09:44.766 --> 01:09:46.726]  And I've been told that by LAPD detectives.
[01:09:47.286 --> 01:09:48.606]  I've been told that by the highest levels.
[01:09:48.646 --> 01:09:53.447]  Why do you think everybody in Hollywood who isn't evil tries to move to Austin or Toronto or somewhere else?
[01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:55.368]  Because it's so horrible.
[01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:59.912]  And you look at these guys, they all have that Dennis Hastert look.
[01:10:00.192 --> 01:10:01.472]  Now you can say, are they pedophiles?
[01:10:01.792 --> 01:10:07.493]  All I know is they should be investigated like Senator Ted Cruz tweeted when he looked at the tweets of Mr. Gunn and others.
[01:10:08.934 --> 01:10:09.474]  Look at that look!
[01:10:10.094 --> 01:10:11.634]  Gunn looks just like the subway guy.
[01:10:11.954 --> 01:10:13.115]  Compare him to the subway guy.
[01:10:13.975 --> 01:10:15.155]  Compare Gunn's face!
[01:10:15.935 --> 01:10:17.096]  It's almost like a clone!
[01:10:17.216 --> 01:10:18.376]  And then put Stelter up!
[01:10:18.436 --> 01:10:20.316]  And I'm not saying Stelter's a pedophile.
[01:10:20.776 --> 01:10:22.817]  He just looks like what they look like.
[01:10:25.215 --> 01:10:28.337]  And I'm just, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:28.377 --> 01:10:30.278]  But there's one shot of the subway guy when you fade it in.
[01:10:31.218 --> 01:10:33.319]  When he's actually smiling, just like that, it looks just like him.
[01:10:33.339 --> 01:10:33.639]  Find it.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.680]  You showed it last week.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.161]  So, here's the deal.
[01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:43.364]  They have to constantly make jokes about it, but if you read what Nambla says, and you read these tweets, this is Nambla propaganda.
[01:10:43.384 --> 01:10:44.465]  They're a member of the UN.
[01:10:44.705 --> 01:10:46.126]  So Mike Cernovich with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:10:47.108 --> 01:10:49.009]  That's why it's always important to go to his actual website.
[01:10:49.029 --> 01:10:51.990]  Look, we have Infowars.com and we have Newswars.com.
[01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:53.391]  More and more, you've got to go to those.
[01:10:53.731 --> 01:10:55.172]  You need to go to Cernovich.com.
[01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:57.773]  C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[01:10:58.253 --> 01:11:00.314]  At Cernovich, you've got to go to his page itself.
[01:11:00.714 --> 01:11:01.275]  Yeah, look at that.
[01:11:01.695 --> 01:11:02.755]  That's the Subway guy.
[01:11:03.896 --> 01:11:05.457]  Subway spokesman and founder.
[01:11:05.477 --> 01:11:05.817]  Boom!
[01:11:08.278 --> 01:11:09.839]  I mean, they got the look, man.
[01:11:09.959 --> 01:11:12.500]  I'm telling you, I've seen the arrest warrants.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.941]  I've seen the mug shots.
[01:11:14.721 --> 01:11:16.562]  I don't know what the deal is, man.
[01:11:18.163 --> 01:11:20.645]  It's like, they're usually white guys.
[01:11:20.805 --> 01:11:22.006]  People want to say white people are bad.
[01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:24.568]  There are some Hispanic pedophiles too.
[01:11:25.769 --> 01:11:26.450]  A few black ones.
[01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.191]  But do we really see a lot of black pedophiles?
[01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:28.992]  No, really you don't.
[01:11:29.432 --> 01:11:32.194]  So Mike, I'm not trying to say white people are bad or something.
[01:11:32.234 --> 01:11:33.875]  I'm just basically...
[01:11:34.963 --> 01:11:35.703]  Profiling here.
[01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:38.064]  Mike Cernovich is also a lawyer, we should add that.
[01:11:39.745 --> 01:11:40.945]  I've kind of prefaced things here.
[01:11:40.965 --> 01:11:42.646]  I appreciate your courage, what you did.
[01:11:43.026 --> 01:11:45.447]  You know, they demonized you in thousands of newspapers.
[01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:48.028]  They acted like you're a horrible person and now they've silenced you.
[01:11:48.068 --> 01:11:53.489]  How dare you expose somebody just dripping over sex with children and defending it?
[01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.390]  You dirty rat!
[01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:59.632]  How dare you not support the gang raping of children?
[01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:01.232]  Because he makes jokes about raping them too.
[01:12:01.492 --> 01:12:03.613]  How do you sleep at night as a father?
[01:12:05.296 --> 01:12:13.065]  Yeah, it really is amazing to watch the media go, look at these conspiracy theorists.
[01:12:13.085 --> 01:12:15.127]  They claim there's all these Hollywood pedophiles.
[01:12:16.056 --> 01:12:17.297]  Oh, they found tweets.
[01:12:17.377 --> 01:12:18.378]  Oh, let's attack them more.
[01:12:19.259 --> 01:12:32.250]  More interesting, Alex, the Daily Beast actually today and Huffington Post two days before, they both published articles where they said it's okay to publish fake news about people you don't like.
[01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:34.432]  This is really the true story of the article.
[01:12:34.452 --> 01:12:35.152]  So what is happening?
[01:12:35.332 --> 01:12:36.934]  Because I would like to address a lot of things.
[01:12:36.974 --> 01:12:38.555]  People go, I found this video of you.
[01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.477]  You didn't find any video of me.
[01:12:41.067 --> 01:12:58.315]  These people who have stalked my family, threatened my family, edit videos, they take audio clips of me, and then they put them into new videos, and then they play their little games, and they lie, so I'm saying horrible things, and people go, it isn't me!
[01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:04.927]  So the Daily Beast confirms that I am the victim of fake news, but they go, oh, ha ha ha, it's funny.
[01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.327]  Cernovich got a taste of his own medicine.
[01:13:07.347 --> 01:13:14.049]  So my message to all of the listeners out there is that everything you see about me that's bad is fake.
[01:13:14.409 --> 01:13:19.771]  Even the Huffington Post admits it, the Daily Beast admits it, but it's okay to
[01:13:20.391 --> 01:13:33.620]  Oh, I was telling you during the break, the whole media lies and says that I said Parkland didn't happen, and then Congressman Gates goes along with it, and then they edit videos of me saying Hillary killed kids in the Middle East with her policy, and say that it's Pizzagate.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.501]  The mainstream media, exactly.
[01:13:35.802 --> 01:13:39.024]  Remember the New York Times last year said it's okay to lie about Trump.
[01:13:40.379 --> 01:13:48.122]  Yeah, so now they're saying it's okay to fabricate and forge videos about you, about me, about anybody you don't like.
[01:13:48.542 --> 01:13:52.003]  So that's why, to me, people go, oh, Cernovich, why don't you address this?
[01:13:52.023 --> 01:13:58.365]  I'm like, you mean address the hundred fake videos, the thousands of fake screencaps that the fake news media has said?
[01:13:58.405 --> 01:14:00.426]  Well, it's okay, because Cernovich deserves it.
[01:14:00.706 --> 01:14:05.488]  But by the way, Alex, this is appalling, and I want to show people how fake the news is in real time.
[01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:12.098]  If you go to my pinned tweet, which it might be deleted any minute because Twitter is shadowbanning me and they want to strike back.
[01:14:12.995 --> 01:14:18.517]  Here are the death threats that I've received by people who fabricate and fake news about me.
[01:14:18.977 --> 01:14:25.360]  One of them said that he performs a self-pleasuring act, me holding my daughter.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:32.702]  Another one said, hope your baby gets, I'm not going to say it out loud, and says hope limbs are cut off.
[01:14:33.062 --> 01:14:36.884]  The Huffington Post said that was a crass remark.
[01:14:37.692 --> 01:14:38.692]  Crass remark, Alex.
[01:14:39.032 --> 01:14:42.113]  So they're endorsing death threats against children.
[01:14:42.393 --> 01:14:44.874]  They're endorsing pedophilia content.
[01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:45.914]  Oh, that's just crass.
[01:14:46.414 --> 01:14:48.494]  And moreover, here's how much they lie.
[01:14:49.455 --> 01:14:57.076]  They claimed that I sent a threatening letter to a reporter who asked people to send him revenge porn of me.
[01:14:57.536 --> 01:15:05.638]  But then I posted the letter from Mark Randazza, and the letter said, hey, your reporter is trying to get revenge porn of Cernovich.
[01:15:06.318 --> 01:15:07.259]  You shouldn't do that.
[01:15:07.719 --> 01:15:09.841]  Oh, by the way, we're not going to sue you.
[01:15:10.162 --> 01:15:10.842]  But you know what?
[01:15:10.922 --> 01:15:12.584]  Maybe just don't be jerks.
[01:15:12.624 --> 01:15:18.008]  We literally say in the last line of the letter, we are not going to take any legal action at this time.
[01:15:18.088 --> 01:15:19.750]  By the way, he's my lawyer, too.
[01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:21.711]  He's a really great guy, one of the top lawyers in the country.
[01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:22.832]  And there's the letter.
[01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.294]  So they lied and said you were threatening people.
[01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:25.635]  We're going to go to break and come back with this.
[01:15:25.675 --> 01:15:26.696]  But the takeaway here is this.
[01:15:27.276 --> 01:15:37.159]  The entire leftist internet has turned against you and is attacking you, and the media is attacking you for exposing someone who worships raping and torturing and sex with children.
[01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:47.222]  So fire somebody like Roseanne Barr that says that Soros is a Nazi when he is, but then when you expose these pedophiles, you're the bad guy.
[01:15:47.642 --> 01:15:52.464]  That is the takeaway, meaning the left has now adopted pedophilia and evil as their culture.
[01:15:52.704 --> 01:15:53.884]  They love being nasty.
[01:15:54.144 --> 01:15:55.144]  They have no bottom.
[01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.425]  The bottom has fallen out.
[01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:57.826]  Absolutely reprobate.
[01:16:17.128 --> 01:16:29.280]  The whole EU unelected bureaucracy is in a combine against nation states and against free market capitalism in a global corporate takeover backed up by paramilitary UN force.
[01:16:30.041 --> 01:16:30.982]  NATO is their army.
[01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:31.883]  Right now!
[01:16:32.594 --> 01:16:34.775]  The Democrats are making their move.
[01:16:35.775 --> 01:16:44.557]  For the last year and a half, in policy papers, they said we're going to overthrow the President using the military, or using 25th Amendment, and we're going to build the case through made-up Russia collusion.
[01:16:45.077 --> 01:16:52.939]  When I would point out the white papers, they'd say, oh, that's crazy, it doesn't exist, because they wanted to build up their forces and get geared up and get ready to make their move.
[01:16:53.239 --> 01:16:57.940]  Now, that President Trump's been in a little over a year and a half, and we enter the summer of rage,
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:11.666]  Congressmen, Senators, former CIA Deputy Directors, FBI Deputy Directors, you name it, former CIA Directors, they're all over the news saying, we're making our move, Trump is a Russian agent, we're going to remove him from office.
[01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:23.131]  This is insane, and they've got a bunch of cowardly Republicans who want to sit on the fence, in case this coup is successful, going, oh yeah, maybe it is bad he met with Putin, maybe he is selling us out.
[01:17:23.971 --> 01:17:26.933]  Trump has been crushing Russia with our energy deals.
[01:17:27.353 --> 01:17:32.675]  Trump has been crushing Russia shipping heavy anti-tank weapons into Ukraine against the Russians.
[01:17:33.136 --> 01:17:34.937]  Trump has been putting massive sanctions on them.
[01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:39.599]  But his rhetoric is friendly to make Russia capitulate and make a deal.
[01:17:39.999 --> 01:17:43.301]  And quite frankly, it's offensive and probably not right what the president's doing.
[01:17:43.601 --> 01:17:47.083]  But you could see it in America's interest, but kind of in an imperial way.
[01:17:47.583 --> 01:17:49.766]  Trump is so pro-America, it's insane.
[01:17:49.826 --> 01:17:51.468]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:52.890]  The economy's turning around.
[01:17:53.271 --> 01:17:59.419]  The traitors of globalism in the Democratic Party and the blue-blood Republicans are the ones that are anti-nation-state.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.584]  They're the ones transferring power to the UN and the TPP.
[01:18:03.064 --> 01:18:04.185]  All the things Trump's killed.
[01:18:04.425 --> 01:18:12.070]  America was basically wearing a ball and chain, and Trump has removed it, and he's returning power back to the states, back to the people.
[01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:13.871]  He's acting as our real president.
[01:18:14.212 --> 01:18:16.793]  Even if you don't agree with some of what he says or does, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:17.073 --> 01:18:18.334]  He really is the president now.
[01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:25.839]  And the bureaucracy, and the lobbyists, and the globalists, and the chi-coms that own our debt and control Hollywood, thought they had this country.
[01:18:26.179 --> 01:18:31.403]  The communist Chinese newspapers admit they're at war with us right now, economically and building up militarily.
[01:18:31.683 --> 01:18:32.484]  They're the big threat.
[01:18:33.024 --> 01:18:35.365]  Russia can't even keep its own country together.
[01:18:35.666 --> 01:18:37.967]  It's being targeted by Soros just like we are.
[01:18:38.467 --> 01:18:43.270]  And that's the only truth in the Russian collusion, is that Russia has the same enemies that America has.
[01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:45.872]  And Russia is being targeted just like we are.
[01:18:46.152 --> 01:18:49.434]  And they're making their move against the President right now.
[01:18:50.054 --> 01:18:57.043]  They've been hyping it and, you know, pushing that they're going to remove him so long to get you punch drunk for when they finally make their move.
[01:18:57.424 --> 01:19:02.991]  But all of us, as Americans, need to understand they've tried to create race wars, class wars, sex wars.
[01:19:03.031 --> 01:19:04.674]  They've tried to divide us every way they can.
[01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:05.955]  They admit they're doing it.
[01:19:06.316 --> 01:19:07.237]  They are the globalists.
[01:19:07.297 --> 01:19:07.898]  They are the enemy.
[01:19:08.098 --> 01:19:22.967]  And it's up to us to call Congress, to call talk radio, to get involved more now than ever against all the internet censorship that they're trying to bring in ahead of a coup against the president and a coup against the electorate in this country that elected him.
[01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:31.853]  This is a war against America trying to have its own self-determination, just like Theresa May is trying to say they're not going to follow the vote for Brexit right now in England.
[01:19:32.313 --> 01:19:32.613]  Thank you.
[01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:15.577]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:26.483]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:42.788 --> 01:21:08.709]  Alright, I started this interview out like 10 minutes ago, 15 minutes ago with Mike Cernovich, investigative journalist, talking about how if all of us go investigate major Hollywood stars, major comedians, all of their main Twitter accounts and their work, there's a vein running through the producers, the directors of pedophilia, and it's a direct NAMBLA statement, North American Man-Boy Love Association.
[01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:10.511]  Now last week,
[01:21:12.185 --> 01:21:33.679]  James Gunn got fired on Friday after Mike Cernovich, part of the show here with us, found hundreds of tweets that talk about raping children, talk about how pleasurable it is, talk about how good it is, talk about how fun it is, and Congressman Senator Ted Cruz came out and said, I think there should be a criminal investigation of James Gunn.
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.500]  So that's what's going on.
[01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:38.562]  Now, I'm debating whether to show this or not.
[01:21:40.323 --> 01:21:43.247]  It's about a five-minute clip, but give it to Rob Dew and blur it out.
[01:21:43.367 --> 01:21:44.849]  This showed on Showtime.
[01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:47.692]  This showed on YouTube.
[01:21:48.212 --> 01:21:53.779]  It's not age-restricted, but when we show it, the news will be Jones shows obscene video.
[01:21:54.059 --> 01:21:55.841]  But I think you have a right to see it.
[01:21:56.402 --> 01:21:57.623]  So it's coming up next segment.
[01:21:57.803 --> 01:21:59.525]  Give them the one-minute clip part and then blur it.
[01:22:00.426 --> 01:22:00.787]  It is
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:14.149]  Dan Harmon, one of the top comedians in the world, just deleted his Twitter after a video surfaces, which got millions of views, Dan Harmon's Daryl raping a baby.
[01:22:15.149 --> 01:22:16.270]  A doll.
[01:22:17.171 --> 01:22:19.813]  But he sneaks in when people are gone and rapes the child.
[01:22:20.413 --> 01:22:21.174]  Simulated rape.
[01:22:22.615 --> 01:22:23.936]  You go, oh, isn't that funny?
[01:22:24.016 --> 01:22:25.377]  But they all do this.
[01:22:25.497 --> 01:22:29.260]  So even if they're not into it, it's how you get promoted by the system.
[01:22:30.714 --> 01:22:31.675]  And it's super sick!
[01:22:31.695 --> 01:22:37.801]  So this is exactly what I was talking about with Mike Cernovich when he first got on, is we've got to get everybody burrowing in.
[01:22:38.021 --> 01:22:39.683]  He won't be able to hide what's in his Twitter.
[01:22:40.463 --> 01:22:43.566]  Believe me, you'd think this is bad if he did Showtime Report.
[01:22:44.677 --> 01:22:53.240]  And like, where have we been as a culture that no wonder the left thinks this is funny and is threatening Cernovich's baby daughter that I've met and is really sweet with chopping her arms off.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:23:04.783]  You know, a guy just got arrested last week from Berkeley saying, he was from Kentucky originally, that he was going to murder Rand Paul, murder his wife, and kill his children like Charlie Manson and pull their guts all over the walls.
[01:23:05.684 --> 01:23:09.925]  It's time that these people understand we're not putting up with this.
[01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:13.506]  And Twitter, as you heard, made a big joke.
[01:23:14.884 --> 01:23:16.264]  And so did the Daily Beast.
[01:23:16.685 --> 01:23:19.285]  Oh, they're just threatening to kill your family, big deal.
[01:23:20.406 --> 01:23:22.487]  So they've gone collectively mentally ill.
[01:23:22.527 --> 01:23:23.607]  They have no bottom, I think.
[01:23:23.967 --> 01:23:24.647]  You're a smart guy.
[01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:25.147]  You're a father.
[01:23:25.187 --> 01:23:25.648]  You're a lawyer.
[01:23:26.748 --> 01:23:29.889]  You were a self-help lifestyle coach before, best-selling books.
[01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:31.350]  You had no reason to get into politics.
[01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:32.370]  You're a smart guy.
[01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:33.390]  What do you think's happened?
[01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:37.972]  I mean, I'm saying like they've been collectively possessed, but they want to torpedo us.
[01:23:39.068 --> 01:23:41.850]  You know, for saying that George Soros is a Nazi and bankrupt us.
[01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:42.330]  Well guess what?
[01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:46.173]  We're coming after all them and no amount of shadow banning is going to work, is it Mike?
[01:23:47.851 --> 01:24:00.374]  No, I mean we are, we're literally in a war for the collective psyche of the people and that's why, remember Alex, I was a nobody in journalism because I'm the guerrilla mindset guy.
[01:24:00.394 --> 01:24:10.396]  I'm the guy who teaches you how to just create the world that you want to live in and that's why I recognize the demonic black magic tactics of the media.
[01:24:10.756 --> 01:24:11.676]  What they're doing
[01:24:12.656 --> 01:24:18.658]  They're trying to manifest a world where you can be a pedophile in Hollywood.
[01:24:19.219 --> 01:24:19.939]  That's what they're doing.
[01:24:19.959 --> 01:24:20.859]  They're persuading people.
[01:24:20.959 --> 01:24:22.380]  Oh, haha, it's just a joke.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.181]  Haha, it's just a joke.
[01:24:24.741 --> 01:24:27.462]  So they're normalizing it, normalizing it, normalizing it.
[01:24:27.482 --> 01:24:30.443]  That way people go, oh yeah, I mean, actually it's kind of funny.
[01:24:30.863 --> 01:24:31.623]  Oh yeah, you're right.
[01:24:31.703 --> 01:24:33.024]  Haha, yeah, this is funny.
[01:24:33.344 --> 01:24:35.385]  Children, the things happening to them.
[01:24:35.485 --> 01:24:36.745]  Oh yeah, LOL, LOL.
[01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:37.746]  That's what they're doing.
[01:24:38.666 --> 01:24:41.429]  Ha ha ha, another person got punched in the head, their MAGA hat taken.
[01:24:41.649 --> 01:24:43.610]  Ha ha ha, they dumped hot coffee on you.
[01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:45.752]  Ha ha ha, they shot Congressman Scalise.
[01:24:45.973 --> 01:24:47.734]  Ha ha ha, they broke Rand Paul's ribs.
[01:24:47.954 --> 01:24:52.098]  Ha ha ha, they kidnapped and raped Barron Trump and took him to a pedophile facility.
[01:24:52.178 --> 01:24:52.639]  Exactly!
[01:24:53.139 --> 01:24:55.161]  It's like their operating system is pedophilia!
[01:24:56.434 --> 01:25:02.160]  Yeah, so they're trying to program people through messaging and say, oh, it's just a joke.
[01:25:02.281 --> 01:25:03.141]  It's just a joke.
[01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:07.186]  And then the brainwashed masses will say, oh, yeah, it's just a joke.
[01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:09.308]  Oh, Dan Harmon is on video.
[01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:12.892]  Oh, it's just a sketch where he breaks and enter.
[01:25:12.952 --> 01:25:15.215]  You know, I watched 10 seconds almost threw up.
[01:25:15.495 --> 01:25:21.801]  Yeah, he breaks and enters, and then there's a child in a bed, and his pants are off, and he rapes the child.
[01:25:22.081 --> 01:25:25.004]  It's a doll, but it's a simulation of him.
[01:25:25.024 --> 01:25:26.865]  You know, in a movie, they use a fake kid.
[01:25:26.966 --> 01:25:29.568]  In a movie, they never showed a pedophile have sex with a kid.
[01:25:29.888 --> 01:25:31.049]  And it's a baby, by the way.
[01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:31.990]  It's a baby.
[01:25:33.732 --> 01:25:37.075]  So he comes in, unzips his pants, and then rapes a baby.
[01:25:39.393 --> 01:25:43.575]  That's what, again, that's what they're trying to just, oh, lighten up, guys!
[01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:44.916]  Lighten up, Alex!
[01:25:45.036 --> 01:25:47.657]  What's wrong with you conspiracy theorists, you Infowars?
[01:25:47.917 --> 01:25:54.900]  You idiots on Infowars are conspiracy theorists who believe that there's pedophiles in Hollywood.
[01:25:55.081 --> 01:25:56.641]  You morons, you're buffoons.
[01:25:57.001 --> 01:25:59.863]  James Gunn didn't say he likes children to touch him.
[01:26:00.123 --> 01:26:03.965]  Dan Harmon isn't on video simulating sexual acts with a child.
[01:26:04.205 --> 01:26:05.746]  You're the idiots, you're the morons.
[01:26:05.786 --> 01:26:06.506]  The media is
[01:26:06.846 --> 01:26:07.647]  Truth and justice.
[01:26:07.667 --> 01:26:12.831]  And you don't have dozens and dozens of major directors caught doing it and standing ovations for Roman Polanski.
[01:26:13.051 --> 01:26:15.533]  It'd be like saying there are no cockroaches in this hotel.
[01:26:16.034 --> 01:26:17.995]  And you walk in your room and like 10 run by.
[01:26:18.176 --> 01:26:20.698]  You turn the light off for five minutes, turn it on, there's a thousand.
[01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:22.239]  They're like, there's no roaches here.
[01:26:22.259 --> 01:26:24.421]  And you're like, roaches are falling off the ceiling.
[01:26:25.782 --> 01:26:34.110]  Well, Sarah Silverman even tweeted out a vocal warm-up, which I'm not going to repeat because that'll get edited in more fake videos.
[01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:34.630]  Exactly.
[01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:35.331]  No, that's what happens.
[01:26:35.431 --> 01:26:37.593]  We repeat what they've said and then they edit it of us.
[01:26:37.613 --> 01:26:38.333]  Believe me, I know.
[01:26:39.214 --> 01:26:47.802]  Yeah, but it mentions it was a vocal warm-up that she learned from Dan Harmon about if you have the gumption to be a pedophile.
[01:26:47.922 --> 01:26:51.185]  I tell you what, why don't you cover your mouth and say it?
[01:26:52.481 --> 01:27:00.990]  So Sarah Silverman tweeted out that a vocal warm-up she learned from Dan Harmon was about having the gumption to be a pedophile.
[01:27:01.311 --> 01:27:02.532]  And we can find that Twitter.
[01:27:02.912 --> 01:27:05.575]  I can send it, you know, I can send it to your people.
[01:27:06.436 --> 01:27:07.598]  Really, really insane.
[01:27:07.698 --> 01:27:14.125]  And Sarah Silverman has all kinds of things where she mentions changing a diaper and noticing things about the female anatomy.
[01:27:16.626 --> 01:27:23.051]  And notice this, they have these top feminists saying, ask for permission when you change your baby's diaper, making it sexual.
[01:27:24.011 --> 01:27:28.874]  Again, they're just implanting, like telling five-year-olds, you might not be a boy, you might not be a girl.
[01:27:29.174 --> 01:27:30.635]  This is their agenda.
[01:27:30.675 --> 01:27:31.436]  This is so evil.
[01:27:32.483 --> 01:27:35.885]  And that Michael Ian Black now was saying that he's being harassed.
[01:27:36.526 --> 01:27:40.628]  He, um, I don't know if we have the screenshot of all of... Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:40.648 --> 01:27:50.015]  So, um, Sarah Silverman, that vocal warm-up was, she says, pedophilia's an option if you've got the... Gumption.
[01:27:50.695 --> 01:27:51.115]  Gumption.
[01:27:51.195 --> 01:27:51.556]  There you go.
[01:27:51.776 --> 01:27:54.658]  Now, Michael Ian Black, of course... And by the way, listeners are tuning in.
[01:27:55.118 --> 01:27:55.838]  They're watching on TV.
[01:27:55.858 --> 01:27:57.459]  They go, why are you saying you can't just say it?
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.521]  Because they edit us and say we said it!
[01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:02.572]  That's why I'm so angry, folks.
[01:28:02.592 --> 01:28:08.454]  You don't know what it's like when they sit there and Congressman Gates goes, Alex Jones says no one died at Parkland.
[01:28:08.754 --> 01:28:09.555]  He's a bad guy.
[01:28:09.575 --> 01:28:13.216]  And it's like, you know full well I never said that, you piece of garbage.
[01:28:13.736 --> 01:28:15.957]  I mean, we've got Republicans rolling over to this, man.
[01:28:16.358 --> 01:28:17.058]  What does that tell you?
[01:28:18.018 --> 01:28:24.882]  Well yeah, and again now the Daily Beast has even said, but let's talk about Michael Ian Black real quick and we can do it again on the next break.
[01:28:25.362 --> 01:28:30.405]  He, the tweets that he has, it's not like one or two jokes, you know, oh here and there.
[01:28:30.425 --> 01:28:31.566]  We've got to go to break, cernovich.com.
[01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:32.847]  I want to be very, very clear here.
[01:28:33.527 --> 01:28:34.568]  He is now shadow banned.
[01:28:34.588 --> 01:28:38.351]  That's the whole thing we're going to show you on air when we come back from your TV viewer or Describer for radio listeners.
[01:28:39.072 --> 01:28:39.852]  We're just like InfoWars.
[01:28:40.072 --> 01:28:44.116]  You'll only see the tweets if you're on InfoWars or on our page or on Cernovich's.
[01:28:44.276 --> 01:28:45.016]  Just like the President.
[01:28:45.357 --> 01:28:47.058]  Almost no one gets his push notification.
[01:28:47.278 --> 01:28:49.160]  He sends a tweet, you're subscribed, you don't get it.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:51.281]  It's like they're intercepting your mail, man.
[01:28:51.602 --> 01:28:52.462]  This is a scandal.
[01:28:52.542 --> 01:28:53.783]  Congress needs to act.
[01:28:54.264 --> 01:28:56.125]  Good Lord, they're intercepting your mail.
[01:28:56.846 --> 01:28:58.127]  Ha ha, a bunch of pedophiles.
[01:29:00.552 --> 01:29:06.135]  Alex Jones here with unbelievably critical information concerning the future of our Republic.
[01:29:06.796 --> 01:29:14.341]  A year and a half ago, just a few months into President Trump being in office, the globalists panicked because the economy began to turn around.
[01:29:16.622 --> 01:29:29.230]  Former Obama administration officials, former deputy heads of the Defense Department and others went to the Pentagon and to Congress and were even in major news publications like Atlantic Monthly
[01:29:30.208 --> 01:29:37.573]  Developing a public plan for a military coup against the president or a 25th amendment removal.
[01:29:38.434 --> 01:29:45.838]  I covered it at the time and mainstream corporate media attacked me and said it wasn't true because they didn't want to have major attention on it.
[01:29:45.919 --> 01:29:49.481]  They only wanted it in establishment publications like Atlantic Monthly.
[01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:52.043]  They did not want to be seen by the general public.
[01:29:52.063 --> 01:29:54.224]  They didn't want to have a debate about it early on.
[01:29:54.464 --> 01:30:00.108]  They wanted to build their false case over the next year or so and then make their move on the president.
[01:30:00.869 --> 01:30:02.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're now making that move.
[01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:09.474]  The last 24 hours, we've seen the former head of the CIA, Brennan, say that Trump is nothing short of treasonous.
[01:30:09.775 --> 01:30:10.935]  When it's Brennan that's the traitor.
[01:30:11.476 --> 01:30:16.900]  Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee has said that the military needs to take him out.
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:17.640]  Where are they?
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:18.841]  Needs to remove them.
[01:30:19.461 --> 01:30:23.024]  Phil Mudd, former deputy director of the CIA and the FBI,
[01:30:23.624 --> 01:30:23.884]  I don't know.
[01:30:49.588 --> 01:30:50.009]  I think?
[01:31:11.015 --> 01:31:11.195]  It's
[01:31:34.818 --> 01:31:37.599]  Defeat the Democrat-Globalist Censorship Plan.

[01:32:14.486 --> 01:32:16.347]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven ourselves.
[01:32:16.387 --> 01:32:17.327]  That's why we're under attack.
[01:32:17.367 --> 01:32:20.227]  And we have this great crew standing in the face of this.
[01:32:20.488 --> 01:32:27.189]  And we have you, the listeners, and the viewers that support us, that make it possible, that pray for us, that share the articles and videos, and amplify our work.
[01:32:27.509 --> 01:32:28.409]  You are the InfoWars.
[01:32:28.889 --> 01:32:41.198]  Americana and true freedom and true Western civilization and true Christianity is the light of the world and we're bringing it back into the world boldly and the enemy is attacking us because they know we have the answer.
[01:32:41.458 --> 01:32:44.580]  We have the light in the dark of the night and so do all of you.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:45.721]  So I ask you today,
[01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:47.822]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:13.946 --> 01:33:19.970]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.615 --> 01:33:32.338]  All right, I want to slow down here so we can kind of speed up, you know what I mean, and get all of it in.
[01:33:32.398 --> 01:33:35.560]  Mike Cernovich is with us, cernovich.com, alexjones, thenfulwars.com.
[01:33:36.664 --> 01:33:46.749]  The mark of effectiveness, the mark of success is being demonized, attacked, lied about, fabrications made, and being censored.
[01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:50.291]  And when it comes to being censored, it's Trump.
[01:33:51.178 --> 01:34:08.089]  And then my shelf, people like Cernovich and Jack Posobiec and others, and I saw all these articles last few days, not even looking, get Cernovich, get Posobiec, get Paul Watson, get him, get him, you know, New York Times, get Alex Jones, because here's the deal, I'm not some giant moral authority.
[01:34:08.829 --> 01:34:14.313]  Everybody knows, I said day one, Trump's a womanizer, not so much in a long time, but he is, he never lied about it.
[01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:17.350]  All I care about is he tells the truth about what he's going to do policy-wise.
[01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:22.372]  The left's always like, you Republicans, you claim you're these Bible-thumpers, but then you're hypocrites.
[01:34:22.432 --> 01:34:23.292]  No, we're not hypocrites.
[01:34:23.552 --> 01:34:29.234]  Don't tell me, don't have some preacher give me sermons about out-of-wedlock sex all day, which I'm not saying is a great thing.
[01:34:29.254 --> 01:34:29.934]  I'm not defending it.
[01:34:30.135 --> 01:34:31.155]  I'm just not judging people.
[01:34:31.695 --> 01:34:33.596]  And then you catch him with hookers every night.
[01:34:34.316 --> 01:34:36.517]  There are a lot of famous... I don't like hypocrites.
[01:34:37.622 --> 01:34:38.984]  But that's consenting adults.
[01:34:39.484 --> 01:34:46.752]  Don't tell me all day about how the gays are going to hell and the fire and all this, but then, you know, you catch half these preachers with a gay boyfriend.
[01:34:47.733 --> 01:34:48.875]  I care about children.
[01:34:49.986 --> 01:34:58.169]  And you get your hands near them, you try to sexualize them, which the schools are doing, all this stuff, that is abuse, that's evil, that's what we're talking about.
[01:34:58.509 --> 01:35:06.072]  And so to all the Christian conservatives, who I respect, a lot of them are great people, and really mean well, let's worry about them targeting the kids first.
[01:35:06.232 --> 01:35:11.454]  Because they use the distraction of gay marriage here, or this or that,
[01:35:13.203 --> 01:35:14.504]  And I'm not even waiting on that debate.
[01:35:14.784 --> 01:35:18.325]  They use it as a... let the gays get married and let the lawyers take everything they got.
[01:35:18.365 --> 01:35:19.006]  No, I'm not saying that.
[01:35:19.866 --> 01:35:20.727]  Civil unions are one thing.
[01:35:20.787 --> 01:35:21.827]  Marriage is a biblical thing.
[01:35:21.887 --> 01:35:22.207]  It's another.
[01:35:22.227 --> 01:35:23.208]  I think it's between a man and a woman.
[01:35:24.248 --> 01:35:29.551]  All I'm getting at here is, is that we missed the whole shoot and match while we're over here with the media debating...
[01:35:30.526 --> 01:35:38.898]  You know, some Baptist church that goes and says that, you know, the military deserves to die because we don't kill the queers and all this stuff.
[01:35:39.219 --> 01:35:40.741]  And as Cernovich said, I got to be careful.
[01:35:40.781 --> 01:35:44.026]  They'll take that quote of me and play it on Colbert saying kill the queers.
[01:35:44.366 --> 01:35:45.007]  I'm quoting them.
[01:35:45.788 --> 01:35:47.769]  Whatever that crazy Baptist church is.
[01:35:47.789 --> 01:35:50.430]  And they're so deceptive, I say, I'm not anti-gay.
[01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:53.371]  And Colbert plays a little clip, a little TV set saying, I'm anti-gay.
[01:35:53.851 --> 01:35:56.712]  But at a certain point, I cover my mouth sometimes just because I know they're going to do it.
[01:35:56.732 --> 01:35:58.853]  But at a certain point, they're the ones doing that.
[01:35:58.933 --> 01:36:00.334]  That should discredit them.
[01:36:01.794 --> 01:36:07.517]  So Mike Cernovich is with us, hopefully a little bit in the next hour, because I'm hot to cover this until at least five after and give him time to go over it.
[01:36:09.521 --> 01:36:15.483]  We've got this shocking clip that we're going to play of Dan Harmon simulating the rape of a baby.
[01:36:16.283 --> 01:36:16.943]  It's blurred out.
[01:36:17.223 --> 01:36:18.543]  It's on Showtime.
[01:36:18.603 --> 01:36:19.724]  It's on YouTube right now.
[01:36:20.124 --> 01:36:20.344]  Watch.
[01:36:20.364 --> 01:36:23.024]  They'll try to take our video down, though, saying it violated terms.
[01:36:23.044 --> 01:36:28.346]  Remember, YouTube got caught allowing pedophilia, allowing all this promotion just this year.
[01:36:28.666 --> 01:36:33.827]  And when they had the hearings, they went, you allow Alex Jones to deny the Holocaust and say no one died at Parkland.
[01:36:33.847 --> 01:36:34.307]  I never did it.
[01:36:34.367 --> 01:36:34.787]  Neither one.
[01:36:35.408 --> 01:36:36.648]  And you allow pedophilia.
[01:36:37.148 --> 01:36:41.570]  So see how they mix their own stuff in to then censor us, but YouTube isn't doing that.
[01:36:41.890 --> 01:36:47.613]  Another sign, Mike Cernovich, more proof of just how this is the culture of Hollywood.
[01:36:47.693 --> 01:36:48.534]  It's not humor.
[01:36:48.574 --> 01:36:49.334]  It's not comedy.
[01:36:49.614 --> 01:37:03.021]  They want to police us and say that, you know, again, if a guy asked a girl out at some form of abuse or microaggression or rape, but then they just want to like demonize and attack you for exposing pedophilia.
[01:37:03.241 --> 01:37:06.503]  They want to be the moral police of everything when they're the most immoral.
[01:37:07.734 --> 01:37:07.994]  Right.
[01:37:08.094 --> 01:37:09.115]  Here's what I said.
[01:37:09.135 --> 01:37:15.461]  If we had an honest media in America, here is the kind of story they would write.
[01:37:16.342 --> 01:37:22.047]  James Gunn said things that nobody who's ever around children should ever say or even think.
[01:37:22.836 --> 01:37:24.818]  The person who found it was Mike Cernovich.
[01:37:25.338 --> 01:37:27.160]  Oh, and we don't think he's a good person either.
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:31.644]  But it doesn't matter if he's a good person, because what he reported was true.
[01:37:32.225 --> 01:37:34.166]  So Mike Cernovich doesn't even matter.
[01:37:34.587 --> 01:37:36.709]  All that matters is James Gunn did this.
[01:37:36.849 --> 01:37:37.830]  It is disgusting.
[01:37:38.170 --> 01:37:39.872]  Keep this person away from children.
[01:37:40.552 --> 01:37:41.213]  That should be the story.
[01:37:41.253 --> 01:37:42.194]  But we don't have an honest media.
[01:37:42.234 --> 01:37:43.455]  Instead, the honest media goes.
[01:37:45.450 --> 01:37:47.831]  James Gunn just made a few jokes.
[01:37:48.391 --> 01:37:50.031]  No, he deleted 10,000 tweets.
[01:37:50.472 --> 01:37:51.372]  It wasn't a few jokes.
[01:37:51.792 --> 01:37:53.372]  Oh, James Gunn made a few jokes.
[01:37:54.033 --> 01:37:55.473]  Oh, and they were old tweets.
[01:37:55.673 --> 01:37:58.514]  Oh, and here's old tweets from Cernovich, which are fake anyway.
[01:37:59.074 --> 01:38:08.557]  They're so dumb, they post fake tweets by impersonation accounts, because when you search my name, you find 100 impersonation accounts.
[01:38:08.937 --> 01:38:18.319]  So the fake news media is so dumb that they go, oh, James Gunn posted tweets about having sex with children, lighten up people.
[01:38:18.439 --> 01:38:19.499]  Oh, by the way, they were old.
[01:38:20.099 --> 01:38:23.419]  Oh, and here's a bunch of old tweets from Cernovich, which aren't even real, most of them.
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:25.260]  And so Cernovich is bad.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.300]  You're like, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.460]  How is this honest?
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.921]  So yeah, yeah, this article in the Daily Beast was incredible.
[01:38:31.621 --> 01:38:35.402]  Alex, let's go back to that Daily Beast article, because there's a line in there.
[01:38:35.962 --> 01:38:38.002]  Control F, complicating matters.
[01:38:38.835 --> 01:38:48.887]  So James Gunn posted on his Twitter that he was linking to a video about a hundred pubescent girls doing things.
[01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:52.551]  So you can Google pubescent, that doesn't mean a 19 or 20 year old.
[01:38:52.591 --> 01:38:53.592]  It has a different meaning.
[01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:56.175]  I won't even click the link because it's illegal.
[01:38:56.456 --> 01:38:58.298]  Well, the person he got the video from
[01:38:59.238 --> 01:38:59.959]  What's going on?
[01:39:12.361 --> 01:39:20.523]  That Cernovich brings up was actually posted by a guy who's a lifetime registered sex offender now, the guy who gave it to James Gunn, right?
[01:39:20.563 --> 01:39:23.644]  But they're like, well, I mean, Cernovich is just muddying the water.
[01:39:23.704 --> 01:39:37.147]  You mean I'm muddying the water by saying James Gunn linked to a video of Cubessa Girls and that the guy he got the video from, which he put on his own blog, was convicted of child pornography and is a sex offender.
[01:39:37.167 --> 01:39:38.967]  I mean, come on, people, right?
[01:39:39.067 --> 01:39:41.028]  That's how demented these people are.
[01:39:42.944 --> 01:39:47.429]  Let's get into your shadowbanning because there's an article on Infowars.com that everybody should sign.
[01:39:47.469 --> 01:39:48.371]  I should have brought this up.
[01:39:48.891 --> 01:39:53.136]  Huge new petition launched to end shadowbanning and social media censorship.
[01:39:54.586 --> 01:39:58.609]  on the government website change.gov that does that.
[01:39:59.189 --> 01:40:00.670]  And Paul Watson's launched this.
[01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:01.771]  Others are joining in.
[01:40:02.211 --> 01:40:03.552]  Zero Hedge is joining in.
[01:40:04.252 --> 01:40:05.533]  National News is joining in.
[01:40:05.553 --> 01:40:13.858]  And then it just goes over the new sites that can track how people are shadow banned, how conservatives, libertarians, anybody exposing pedophilia.
[01:40:14.438 --> 01:40:15.259]  You want to get banned?
[01:40:16.159 --> 01:40:17.340]  Talk bad about Roman Polanski.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:19.661]  He's their god raping little girls.
[01:40:20.522 --> 01:40:22.143]  So let's get into that.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:30.453]  Yeah, so actually, you know, we ought to do just a list of all this because there's so much we can't keep track.
[01:40:30.834 --> 01:40:33.038]  Meryl Streep called Harvey Weinstein a god.
[01:40:33.359 --> 01:40:35.202]  Meryl Streep gives that standing ovation.
[01:40:36.249 --> 01:40:37.810]  For pedophile Roman Polanski.
[01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:54.464]  I mean that we just should have a list of this stuff because every time people call us crazy we should just refer back and say well no no here's actually we should what we should do like a hundred times Hollywood celebrated pedophiles and just have a one-stop shop for people to get
[01:40:55.779 --> 01:40:57.240]  But that's why they're shadowbanning us.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:00.262]  Because they... You can do anything.
[01:41:00.522 --> 01:41:02.543]  You can send death threats to my children.
[01:41:02.763 --> 01:41:03.524]  They don't care.
[01:41:03.884 --> 01:41:04.444]  Nobody cares.
[01:41:04.464 --> 01:41:05.465]  The media thinks it's funny.
[01:41:05.725 --> 01:41:06.506]  They can threaten you.
[01:41:06.566 --> 01:41:07.326]  Nobody cares.
[01:41:07.966 --> 01:41:12.209]  But if you go after pedophilia, you are attacking their means of control.
[01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:18.333]  Hollywood controls every director, every big time person in Hollywood.
[01:41:18.733 --> 01:41:23.175]  They keep revenge pornography of people, revenge pornography of children, they even do.
[01:41:23.755 --> 01:41:25.776]  And then they own that person for the entire life.
[01:41:25.796 --> 01:41:27.117]  That's how they enslave people.
[01:41:27.477 --> 01:41:29.998]  And then they invite people from the media to their parties.
[01:41:30.799 --> 01:41:35.141]  They invite people for, you know, risotto and other kinds of stuff.
[01:41:35.521 --> 01:41:41.324]  They, you know, they invite people to from the media, from politics, and then they blackmail everybody.
[01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:45.553]  Just like Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed everybody, right?
[01:41:45.573 --> 01:41:53.679]  That's why Jeffrey Epstein was given a free... Oh yeah, so for people who say we don't... Oh yeah, Mueller used him for a decade as a confidential informant videotaping it all.
[01:41:54.676 --> 01:41:56.498]  Yeah, and Alexander Acosta.
[01:41:56.758 --> 01:41:59.220]  People go, Cernovich, you and Jones never criticized Trump.
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:00.221]  Are you kidding me?
[01:42:00.621 --> 01:42:10.831]  Alexander Acosta was the federal prosecutor who gave pedophile Jeffrey Epstein a free pass, and Acosta was given a position in the Trump administration.
[01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:14.154]  Secretary, I believe, of Labor, Alexander Acosta.
[01:42:14.634 --> 01:42:17.035]  So, I always said that never should have happened.
[01:42:17.675 --> 01:42:24.616]  Never should have happened, and I'm still to this day have no tolerance for that kind of stuff for people who enable Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:42:24.676 --> 01:42:34.059]  So, anybody who says we don't call out Trump's administration, Alexander Acosta should be driven from public life, legally and lawfully, and never have any contact.
[01:42:34.079 --> 01:42:34.319]  Absolutely.
[01:42:34.339 --> 01:42:38.840]  And we come back, Mike Cernovich, I want to ask you, I want to play this shocking clip we blurted out of
[01:42:40.526 --> 01:42:45.928]  Portly Showtime, YouTube plays this, of someone simulating the rape of a year-old baby.
[01:42:46.768 --> 01:42:48.728]  This is Dan Harmon's lead at his Twitter.
[01:42:49.148 --> 01:42:50.249]  Get into their Twitters, folks.
[01:42:50.329 --> 01:42:52.829]  It isn't just a worship fest of pedophiles.
[01:42:53.490 --> 01:42:54.350]  Where's this all going?
[01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.810]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.850 --> 01:43:01.891]  The deep state is making its move.
[01:43:02.532 --> 01:43:10.156]  Multiple members of Congress, the FBI, the CIA, are all on television saying, we need the military to remove the president.
[01:43:11.016 --> 01:43:16.159]  We need a coup in this country, bare minimum, 25th Amendment, to remove him from office.
[01:43:16.199 --> 01:43:16.600]  And why?
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:22.263]  Because he went and had a summit a year and a half plus into office that he should have had a month into office.
[01:43:24.203 --> 01:43:42.169]  Think about that, calling it treason, calling it traitorous, that Trump was nice to Putin in his language, when in truth, Trump has been crushing Russia with expanded U.S.
[01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:47.090]  energy sales, by shipping missiles into Ukraine to fight the Russians, with all these sanctions.
[01:43:47.190 --> 01:43:47.970]  It's incredible!
[01:43:48.330 --> 01:43:49.531]  But here's the big takeaway.
[01:43:50.211 --> 01:43:52.534]  Hiding in plain view that they hope you don't pay attention to.
[01:43:52.834 --> 01:43:55.096]  The Democrats are the party of globalism.
[01:43:56.237 --> 01:43:59.701]  Along with the blue-blood Republicans like George Herbert Walker Bush and his New World Order speech.
[01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:07.769]  Globalism is about taking national sovereignty away and transferring it to the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN.
[01:44:08.632 --> 01:44:09.853]  The EU is unelected.
[01:44:10.453 --> 01:44:12.874]  It's in a trade war with us with giant tariffs on us.
[01:44:13.574 --> 01:44:15.515]  Canada, China, they all have huge tariffs.
[01:44:15.535 --> 01:44:16.476]  We have nothing on them.
[01:44:16.936 --> 01:44:19.597]  Trump is 100% fighting for the country.
[01:44:19.817 --> 01:44:21.378]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[01:44:22.198 --> 01:44:23.199]  It's America first.
[01:44:23.519 --> 01:44:27.921]  Our military, our borders, our everything, that's what you do when you strengthen the nation.
[01:44:28.361 --> 01:44:30.342]  The globalists are about weakening the nation.
[01:44:30.823 --> 01:44:31.283]  Democrat,
[01:44:32.443 --> 01:44:37.747]  Appellate court, Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags in schools on the West Coast because it's a hate symbol.
[01:44:38.268 --> 01:44:39.388]  They hate flyover country.
[01:44:39.549 --> 01:44:40.489]  They hate bitter clingers.
[01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:42.431]  The universities hate America.
[01:44:42.591 --> 01:44:43.431]  They hate free speech.
[01:44:43.772 --> 01:44:45.613]  They're the party of globalism.
[01:44:45.933 --> 01:44:47.774]  They're the party of the New World Order.
[01:44:48.015 --> 01:44:54.119]  They're the party of destroying America's sovereignty, breaking our families up, demoralizing us, creating racial strife.
[01:44:54.339 --> 01:44:55.260]  It's all in the WikiLeaks!
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:56.881]  They're the ones of fake news.
[01:44:56.961 --> 01:44:58.282]  They're the ones that rig the debates.
[01:44:58.362 --> 01:45:01.725]  They're the ones that steal billions of dollars and launder money with their foundations.
[01:45:01.765 --> 01:45:07.950]  They're the ones caught in child sex trafficking with Jeffrey Epstein and Lolita Express and all the rest of it.
[01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:09.010]  They're the enemy.
[01:45:09.751 --> 01:45:22.701]  And then they turn around and point their finger at Trump, who's clearly America first, classic Americana, and the country coming back from the dead, and say because he met with the second biggest nuclear arms country in the world, he better be
[01:45:23.862 --> 01:45:25.463]  That he's a traitor?
[01:45:25.923 --> 01:45:27.904]  And that the military needs to remove him?
[01:45:28.564 --> 01:45:30.786]  That sounds like something out of the old Soviet Union!
[01:45:31.686 --> 01:45:34.448]  Just like the left's calling for me to be banned and taken off the air.
[01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:35.869]  They openly admit it.
[01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:37.770]  They are the clear and present danger.
[01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:38.911]  They're the globalists.
[01:45:38.971 --> 01:45:39.791]  They're the deep state.
[01:45:40.072 --> 01:45:45.075]  And now this hype even has some conservatives going, well, I guess he should have been tougher on Putin.
[01:45:45.335 --> 01:45:46.756]  Yeah, we're a nation.
[01:45:47.036 --> 01:45:48.057]  We're sovereign.
[01:45:48.297 --> 01:45:49.698]  We're being taken over by Russia.
[01:45:50.538 --> 01:45:53.520]  Russia has the same enemy as us, George Soros.
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:46:02.365]  A lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion, but does it make him, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[01:46:02.705 --> 01:46:06.067]  It's the multinationals working with the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[01:46:06.547 --> 01:46:09.429]  It's Hollywood owned by the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[01:46:09.769 --> 01:46:11.210]  Not the Russians and not Trump.
[01:46:11.550 --> 01:46:13.711]  If the Russians were doing any of this, I'd be their enemy.
[01:46:14.072 --> 01:46:14.672]  But they're not.
[01:46:15.072 --> 01:46:17.634]  They're trying to stabilize themselves just like we are.
[01:46:18.474 --> 01:46:21.136]  Every sovereign nation in the world is under globalist attack.
[01:46:21.776 --> 01:46:28.040]  Infowars is on the front lines fighting against that and promoting true open free societies and free market capitalism.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.060]  And so is Trump.
[01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:33.323]  And I stand with him against all the bullies and all the followers and all the cowards.
[01:46:33.543 --> 01:46:36.805]  And I know we're going to continue to win thanks to all of you in the Infowars.
[01:46:37.025 --> 01:46:40.707]  But make no mistake, they're making their move and they are the enemy.
[01:46:41.027 --> 01:46:42.949]  They are the threat to this nation.
[01:46:44.029 --> 01:46:47.332]  It's sovereignty and our people's safety and prosperity.
[01:46:47.832 --> 01:46:50.955]  I'm Alex Jones, reporting for duty in the battle for the Republic.
[01:46:51.475 --> 01:46:52.356]  The year is 2018.
[01:46:53.237 --> 01:46:54.098]  History's happening now.
[01:46:54.558 --> 01:46:56.079]  Choose which side you're on.
[01:47:03.946 --> 01:47:06.608]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.472 --> 01:47:16.693]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:17.034 --> 01:47:23.397]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:47:26.499 --> 01:47:28.760]  Guys, I know when something's big.
[01:47:29.701 --> 01:47:38.346]  And let me tell you, getting into the text messages that are public, the Twitter messages, the Twitter statements, the public statements of these Hollywood people,
[01:47:39.574 --> 01:47:52.803]  I remember being out in Hollywood, and they wanted me to be on TV shows, movies, and just the fact that they would say the most bizarre things, and I thought they thought it was because I was a Christian from Texas, and I learned, no, this is standard.
[01:47:53.344 --> 01:47:54.665]  And I just said, I don't want to be part of this.
[01:47:55.538 --> 01:47:57.519]  That's why I've told Mike Cernovich, get out of LA, man.
[01:47:57.559 --> 01:47:59.601]  Move to Texas or somewhere else.
[01:47:59.681 --> 01:48:01.362]  But we're going to go back to Mike Cernovich here in a moment.
[01:48:01.382 --> 01:48:09.207]  I want to ask him where all this is going with all these big Hollywood directors, producers, comedians obsessed with pedophilia.
[01:48:09.307 --> 01:48:10.048]  Sarah Silverman.
[01:48:11.248 --> 01:48:11.589]  All of it.
[01:48:12.029 --> 01:48:13.170]  They're not trying to be shocking.
[01:48:13.690 --> 01:48:17.072]  They want to degrade something you're willing to stand up for.
[01:48:17.172 --> 01:48:18.213]  They want your soul.
[01:48:18.273 --> 01:48:19.554]  They want you to roll over to them.
[01:48:20.606 --> 01:48:34.435]  And the coin you pay Choron to cross the river Styx to give up your soul and to go into hell, to go into Hollywood, and I guess be somebody that soulless crypt is debasing children, as Christ said.
[01:48:34.876 --> 01:48:39.038]  Suffer the little ones better to tie a millstone around your neck and cast in the deepest ocean than hurt one of these.
[01:48:39.118 --> 01:48:42.481]  Now listen, we are taking on the pedophiles.
[01:48:42.501 --> 01:48:43.862]  We're taking on the devil worshippers.
[01:48:43.882 --> 01:48:45.363]  We're taking on the radical Islamists.
[01:48:45.403 --> 01:48:46.623]  We're having a huge effect.
[01:48:46.643 --> 01:48:47.444]  We're changing the world.
[01:48:48.965 --> 01:48:50.266]  But we need your financial support.
[01:48:52.591 --> 01:48:56.233]  I need to expand in the face of all their attacks and not just stay the same size.
[01:48:56.333 --> 01:48:58.214]  And quite frankly, I've been so busy focusing on news.
[01:48:58.774 --> 01:49:00.555]  We have been in the negative the last few months.
[01:49:00.575 --> 01:49:03.957]  I don't want to encourage our enemies, but it's true because I just, I need to promote products.
[01:49:04.017 --> 01:49:04.818]  I need to spend time on it.
[01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:06.659]  I need to do it, but I haven't been doing it.
[01:49:07.019 --> 01:49:08.500]  We have great products everybody needs, man.
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:10.301]  I mean, just like our information changes the world.
[01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:12.682]  X2 is pure iodine.
[01:49:12.862 --> 01:49:14.163]  Learned about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:49:14.183 --> 01:49:17.845]  Learned about the bad halogen fluoride, chlorine, bromide, all of it.
[01:49:17.865 --> 01:49:20.646]  And the good halogen, a true iodine.
[01:49:20.826 --> 01:49:21.827]  You can't get this anywhere else.
[01:49:22.287 --> 01:49:22.687]  X2.
[01:49:23.388 --> 01:49:24.749]  Biotricillinium goes with it great.
[01:49:24.769 --> 01:49:26.109]  It's amazing for the mustard seed.
[01:49:26.449 --> 01:49:27.470]  Brain Force is incredible.
[01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:28.451]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:49:28.491 --> 01:49:30.932]  Now with energy, DNA Force Plus.
[01:49:31.452 --> 01:49:32.493]  We bid bigger contracts.
[01:49:32.513 --> 01:49:33.733]  We get more of it at a lower price.
[01:49:34.594 --> 01:49:36.455]  Telomere, Defense, all of it.
[01:49:36.815 --> 01:49:37.956]  Vodka, the great sleep aid.
[01:49:39.104 --> 01:49:43.266]  A lot of mineral fusion, super metal vitality, it's all there.
[01:49:43.707 --> 01:49:48.069]  We have, this is the biggest sale ever because, I'd say just do whatever sale you want.
[01:49:48.089 --> 01:49:49.170]  I was busy last week.
[01:49:49.650 --> 01:49:52.652]  They did 67% off some items, making them lost leaders.
[01:49:52.672 --> 01:49:54.953]  Signed up for auto, shipped an additional 10% off.
[01:49:55.333 --> 01:49:59.416]  But the average savings is 50% and free shipping.
[01:49:59.856 --> 01:50:03.578]  It's not like we raise prices like Walmart and people have been caught doing it and they have a 50% off.
[01:50:03.618 --> 01:50:04.979]  No, it's off the regular price.
[01:50:06.368 --> 01:50:09.209]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, 4-5-Acrylic Silver Iodine.
[01:50:09.289 --> 01:50:12.010]  It's there for adults and children, the mouthwash, all of it.
[01:50:12.230 --> 01:50:18.292]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:18.652 --> 01:50:22.113]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:50:22.153 --> 01:50:25.734]  That sale has to end today, so take advantage of that and support the InfoWars.
[01:50:25.774 --> 01:50:28.335]  Now, Mike, we've got you for eight minutes here and five more minutes.
[01:50:29.336 --> 01:50:30.016]  Let me ask you this.
[01:50:32.461 --> 01:50:41.298]  I was telling the crew, when we put this up on YouTube and Facebook, even with the shadow ban, we still have, you know, average 100,000 views per video, once it, you know, tops out in a week or so.
[01:50:41.318 --> 01:50:44.404]  I was saying...
[01:50:45.504 --> 01:50:51.186]  Journalist Mike Cernovich banned on Twitter for exposing pedophiles, or pedophile promotion.
[01:50:51.206 --> 01:50:53.507]  And they're like, well wait, he's been shadow banned.
[01:50:53.547 --> 01:51:01.869]  It's not really... Well, when you're blocked from in the search term, and you're blocked where only people can see you on the page, they basically killed what Twitter is.
[01:51:03.210 --> 01:51:05.911]  But the crew's not bad asking me that question.
[01:51:07.251 --> 01:51:07.751]  They're right.
[01:51:07.811 --> 01:51:12.793]  I mean, International Business Times says certain far-right figures no longer appear in Twitter search function.
[01:51:14.267 --> 01:51:17.395]  So the headline is, investigative journalist banned from Twitter search.
[01:51:19.127 --> 01:51:20.828]  For exposing Hollywood pedophilia.
[01:51:21.028 --> 01:51:21.629]  I mean, that's it.
[01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:30.495]  The point is, they play the semantical games, like Zuckerberg's like, we only ban him being searchable, no one can see him, but if we totally ban him, that's a ban.
[01:51:30.815 --> 01:51:36.379]  So it's almost like, you know, we put you in solitary confinement on a mountaintop, you'll never be seen again, but you're not dead.
[01:51:36.439 --> 01:51:37.259]  Well, you wish you were.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:46.466]  So they play these games because they're discriminating, and the fact that they would do this to you is perfect for Congress, perfect for the President, I think, as the cause celeb that
[01:51:46.846 --> 01:51:51.772]  You exposed Gunn, he had to be fired, now all these others, and then now you are Shadowban.
[01:51:51.812 --> 01:51:54.414]  Now you've entered the realm of Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
[01:51:54.454 --> 01:51:56.156]  So, speak to that.
[01:51:56.196 --> 01:51:57.258]  We're showing it on TV.
[01:51:57.618 --> 01:52:00.701]  Explain to people what the Shadowban means and where you think this is going.
[01:52:01.682 --> 01:52:08.310]  Right, and for those watching who are new to me, John Conyers, a member of Congress, resigned.
[01:52:09.195 --> 01:52:09.875]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.214 --> 01:52:34.255]  Oh, there's this guy, Cernovich.
[01:52:35.455 --> 01:52:39.156]  He reports big stories like the Susan Rice unmasking story, which was true.
[01:52:39.596 --> 01:52:41.737]  He reports big stories like John Conyers.
[01:52:42.057 --> 01:52:43.877]  He reports big stories like James Gunn.
[01:52:44.117 --> 01:52:45.718]  People go, oh, Cernovich, who's that?
[01:52:45.818 --> 01:52:49.859]  And then they search for me and they find 15 fake accounts.
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:58.664]  And then these fake accounts are all going, I wanted you, and then these horrible things, and then people go, oh wow, that... And videos of gorillas eating poop.
[01:52:59.325 --> 01:53:00.505]  So this is how they counter you.
[01:53:01.085 --> 01:53:06.408]  Just like when you search all the stuff we broke, you just get edits and memes and fake stuff.
[01:53:07.409 --> 01:53:08.429]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:53:08.469 --> 01:53:17.574]  So what they're doing is, but if I go look at, if they ban me, then they admit that they support John Conyers, and they admit that they support child molesters.
[01:53:18.112 --> 01:53:26.634]  So they don't want to ban me because then it's too obvious and everybody's like, wait, so you banned the guy who exposed James Gunn and John Conyers.
[01:53:27.094 --> 01:53:29.814]  Wait, so why would you ban that guy, right?
[01:53:30.194 --> 01:53:33.495]  While allowing, why isn't James Gunn banned?
[01:53:33.535 --> 01:53:35.015]  Why isn't Michael Ian Black banned?
[01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:39.176]  Why isn't Patton Oswalt banned for talking about NAMBLA and Sarah Silverman?
[01:53:39.516 --> 01:53:44.277]  And Trevor Noah has his own pedo jokes and Trevor Noah made a joke
[01:53:44.857 --> 01:53:47.861]  About Chris Brown beating up women.
[01:53:47.881 --> 01:53:49.483]  He made jokes about domestic violence.
[01:53:49.523 --> 01:53:50.405]  I retweeted those things.
[01:53:50.445 --> 01:53:52.007]  Well, I mean take one look at Trevor Noah.
[01:53:52.067 --> 01:53:52.928]  He's got the look.
[01:53:54.008 --> 01:53:57.629]  So why do you ban me for reporting on what they're actually doing?
[01:53:57.649 --> 01:54:00.911]  Because you're a real reporter with courage, and that's why they want you shut down.
[01:54:00.931 --> 01:54:02.391]  That's why they want Infowars shut down.
[01:54:02.411 --> 01:54:03.652]  That's why they want Drudge Report shut down.
[01:54:04.092 --> 01:54:05.952]  So the question is, it's all admitted now.
[01:54:05.992 --> 01:54:10.374]  They put imposters up there to defame you, so people can't find what you're really doing.
[01:54:11.074 --> 01:54:14.275]  Just like real Alex Jones, how do people then go into Twitter?
[01:54:14.315 --> 01:54:15.376]  People say, well, just leave that.
[01:54:15.436 --> 01:54:15.616]  No.
[01:54:15.936 --> 01:54:17.457]  They want us off this battlefield.
[01:54:17.797 --> 01:54:20.878]  We have to show they're censoring to get Congress and Trump to do something.
[01:54:22.168 --> 01:54:23.009]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:23.129 --> 01:54:25.010]  And that's why they're being subtle.
[01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:35.437]  And what they're going to do is they're going, what they're going to do is they're going to, before the midterms, they're going to turn off the internet out.
[01:54:35.478 --> 01:54:39.040]  So that's why they have, they're just going to, so they're shadow banning us now.
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:40.641]  And then I totally agree.
[01:54:40.661 --> 01:54:43.003]  They're ratcheting up to basically a virtual ban.
[01:54:44.082 --> 01:54:51.404]  Yeah, so they're normalizing, and then right before the election, they'll just delete 100 accounts all at once, and so we have to act now.
[01:54:51.604 --> 01:54:53.165]  We have to call attention to it now.
[01:54:54.065 --> 01:54:56.085]  We, I don't know, maybe we need a march?
[01:54:56.245 --> 01:55:11.850]  Maybe we need to just get all, everybody, maybe we need to organize a march, Alex, at this point, because they obviously are planning a big event before November, so that they can- That's right, they're gonna do something right before the election, and they want us, they're gonna shut us off, saying, oh, we can't let them say it didn't happen.
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:14.080]  Even though we didn't say that.
[01:55:14.461 --> 01:55:20.804]  They're setting the precedent to ban us all so that any real media isn't there when they pull something big.
[01:55:22.184 --> 01:55:24.806]  Yeah, so maybe, you know, we just need to organize a big event.
[01:55:25.186 --> 01:55:26.326]  Get a few thousand.
[01:55:26.406 --> 01:55:28.567]  Is there an Austin office at Twitter?
[01:55:28.867 --> 01:55:30.248]  Does Twitter have an office in Austin?
[01:55:31.549 --> 01:55:32.449]  Yeah, they've got offices.
[01:55:32.469 --> 01:55:33.130]  So does Google.
[01:55:33.150 --> 01:55:35.030]  The point is they think we're so stupid.
[01:55:35.190 --> 01:55:35.851]  Here's the good news.
[01:55:36.786 --> 01:55:38.549]  They want to play this moral superiority game.
[01:55:38.569 --> 01:55:39.230]  We're destroying them.
[01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:40.912]  They're failing on every front.
[01:55:41.813 --> 01:55:43.956]  Hillary knows there's going to be a giant red wave.
[01:55:44.337 --> 01:55:45.559]  What do you expect them to do?
[01:55:45.579 --> 01:55:47.962]  Because I don't even think the false flag they're going to pull is going to work.
[01:55:49.204 --> 01:55:53.070]  Well, the reason they're shadow banning us is so that they can propagandize people.
[01:55:53.986 --> 01:55:56.308]  And, you know, maybe I need to fly out to Austin then.
[01:55:56.328 --> 01:56:07.416]  Maybe we just need to get a bunch of people to show up and let them know that banning us and shadowbanning us and defending the... You know, again, I don't want to accuse anyone on Twitter or Google of this yet.
[01:56:07.537 --> 01:56:09.598]  I want to hear their side of the story.
[01:56:09.998 --> 01:56:17.904]  But why would you shadowban the person who just reported on truthful tweets about James Gunn, but not shadowban James Gunn?
[01:56:18.445 --> 01:56:19.686]  If you're going to choose sides,
[01:56:20.419 --> 01:56:22.620]  Why would you choose his side?
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.160]  Well, there's your headline.
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:29.762]  Why did Twitter just choose the side of prominent pedophile promoters over journalists?
[01:56:30.062 --> 01:56:31.322]  They need to answer that question.
[01:56:31.782 --> 01:56:39.784]  That's up for them to answer because I know that right after I broke the James Gunn story, and by the way, I'm so tired of people saying I got him fired.
[01:56:40.144 --> 01:56:41.405]  I didn't get anybody fired.
[01:56:41.425 --> 01:56:42.485]  He got himself fired!
[01:56:43.526 --> 01:56:45.367]  It's just like they changed the subject on WikiLeaks.
[01:56:45.707 --> 01:56:47.789]  Hillary's calling black people animals.
[01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:51.111]  Hillary is saying she hates her barista supporters.
[01:56:51.432 --> 01:56:53.813]  Hillary's saying she wants to create race war and rig things.
[01:56:54.194 --> 01:56:56.455]  And then it becomes, who got the info?
[01:56:56.515 --> 01:56:57.636]  What about the WikiLeaks?
[01:56:58.517 --> 01:57:00.298]  No, James Gunn got himself fired.
[01:57:01.639 --> 01:57:02.920]  Yeah, this is all his stuff.
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:03.961]  I did journalism.
[01:57:04.481 --> 01:57:08.124]  All I did, and I did real journalism, unlike the fake stuff that you see out there.
[01:57:08.144 --> 01:57:09.966]  You reported on what he said.
[01:57:10.856 --> 01:57:11.116]  Right.
[01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:12.738]  So why am I the villain?
[01:57:12.899 --> 01:57:14.541]  Well, I mean, we know why.
[01:57:15.001 --> 01:57:15.942]  We know why I'm the villain.
[01:57:16.703 --> 01:57:19.747]  I'm the villain because these are protected people.
[01:57:20.088 --> 01:57:22.591]  Pedophiles are the new protected class.
[01:57:23.051 --> 01:57:28.138]  There will be a further move to make it so that's illegal to discriminate against pedophiles.
[01:57:28.578 --> 01:57:29.840]  That's the last next move.
[01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:32.919]  Well that's it.
[01:57:33.079 --> 01:57:35.862]  Let's just do five more minutes on this because this is the big fight.
[01:57:35.882 --> 01:57:36.963]  They're making all their moves.
[01:57:37.623 --> 01:57:44.931]  And it actually shocks me that mainstream media across the board would defend pedophilia and say you're bad for exposing literal pedophile worshippers.
[01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:49.536]  And we'll show the shocking clip from Showtime with one of these top guys simulating.
[01:57:50.136 --> 01:57:50.797]  It's all happening.
[01:57:52.339 --> 01:57:53.460]  Trump is a nationalist.
[01:57:54.501 --> 01:57:55.422]  The country's coming back.
[01:57:57.130 --> 01:58:05.376]  The globalist forces in this country, the Democrats, the establishment Republicans, are openly saying they want to remove him for a military coup, or for the 25th Amendment.
[01:58:05.496 --> 01:58:06.456]  It's unbelievable.
[01:58:06.776 --> 01:58:07.817]  It's all happening right now.
[01:58:08.317 --> 01:58:17.784]  That's why it's more important than ever that every viewer, every listener, to local radio, to TV, or over the internet, understand, your voice isn't just critical, it's essential.
[01:58:18.464 --> 01:58:26.610]  If you don't stand up and speak out, and stand up against these bullies, and point out that it's the globalists that are the ones that sold out America, not Trump, and that they're the enemy,
[01:58:27.250 --> 01:58:27.890]  They're the traitors.
[01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:30.651]  They may be successful removing our president.
[01:58:30.991 --> 01:58:33.352]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:33.832 --> 01:58:38.673]  Trump is so real, he's so hardcore, and it's so unbelievable to see that we are at this point.
[01:58:38.953 --> 01:58:41.414]  We are in the middle of a second American Revolution.
[01:58:41.774 --> 01:58:44.495]  This time, not against King George III, but against the globalists.
[01:58:44.935 --> 01:58:49.038]  We're running a special for a week that is the biggest sale we've ever done.

[01:59:33.503 --> 01:59:34.244]  Pay it forward.
[01:59:34.564 --> 01:59:39.028]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:39.408 --> 01:59:40.849]  This is the battle for the future.
[01:59:41.190 --> 01:59:42.311]  This is the war for the future.
[01:59:42.671 --> 01:59:46.054]  And I need all of you to commit even more to this fight.
[01:59:46.474 --> 01:59:46.814]  Thank you.
[01:59:47.094 --> 01:59:48.494]  I'm counting on you, and I salute you.
[01:59:51.315 --> 01:59:57.276]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:01.837 --> 02:00:14.380]  You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[02:00:16.184 --> 02:00:21.307]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.249 --> 02:00:39.919]  Alright, final segment with Mike Cernovich, then we've got the editor of Westminster coming on about Brexit and the acid attacks on three-year-olds and everything else that's happening as Europe just sinks into total insanity.
[02:00:40.979 --> 02:00:41.340]  But Mike...
[02:00:42.449 --> 02:00:53.496]  Again, they play this moral game, saying that men and women together is evil, and the word mother and father is bad and hurts feelings, and we all need genderless bathrooms because the left's all a bunch of perverts, and they just want to play God.
[02:00:53.916 --> 02:00:56.017]  We just go, okay, we're good, we'll do what you say.
[02:00:56.778 --> 02:01:01.181]  But now their demonization of you and others for exposing pedophile worship
[02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:08.143]  In Hollywood, seems like the biggest jumping of the shark I've ever seen, but we were talking during the break, Trump needs to take action.
[02:01:08.183 --> 02:01:13.504]  I know he's overwhelmed, worried about Korea and military things, and they keep presidents distracted on international issues.
[02:01:13.544 --> 02:01:14.665]  He's trying to get the economy going.
[02:01:15.105 --> 02:01:23.187]  I'm not giving him an A+, but he needs to get on the internet situation and how they're trying to silence him, how he's shadow banned, what's happening to you, me.
[02:01:23.207 --> 02:01:27.348]  I know some of this gets to the president, but what would you say to Trump?
[02:01:28.928 --> 02:01:31.551]  Yeah, I would tell Trump, well, here's the issue.
[02:01:32.372 --> 02:01:38.398]  Trump doesn't really understand how vital his supporters were on the ground.
[02:01:39.099 --> 02:01:45.605]  And that's because he's been lied to by Mark Short, Johnny DeStefano is another guy, Brian Hook is another guy.
[02:01:46.286 --> 02:01:51.371]  They were all lying to him about the things that were happening on the level.
[02:01:52.192 --> 02:02:00.899]  I would tell Trump, if you believe the news is fake, then why would you want to give the fake news media a monopoly over the minds of the American people, right?
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:08.446]  That you want the American people to have access to true information to find out what is really going on in the world.
[02:02:08.906 --> 02:02:10.027]  And again, that's the problem.
[02:02:10.087 --> 02:02:10.967]  He's older.
[02:02:11.047 --> 02:02:12.128]  He still reads the New York Times.
[02:02:12.168 --> 02:02:14.029]  He still thinks Fox News is the biggest thing in town.
[02:02:14.429 --> 02:02:20.312]  He didn't know that before the censorship, there were 100 videos a day with more views than Fox News 10 times.
[02:02:20.872 --> 02:02:24.014]  I mean, every video we did had a million, two million views.
[02:02:24.274 --> 02:02:25.735]  Many of them, 30, 40 million views.
[02:02:25.775 --> 02:02:26.956]  They've dialed that way down.
[02:02:26.976 --> 02:02:29.317]  He just, he just, he let them take his biggest weapon.
[02:02:30.532 --> 02:02:35.555]  Yeah, and we should also, we want Trump to know because Trump understands the problem with these perverts.
[02:02:36.095 --> 02:02:40.177]  We need to let Trump know that the fake news media is defending James Gunn.
[02:02:40.897 --> 02:02:47.260]  And the only reason anybody knows about what James Gunn did and said is because social media reported on it.
[02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:50.622]  Remember, the real media, right, the real news,
[02:02:51.374 --> 02:02:52.274]  They ignored this.
[02:02:52.294 --> 02:02:53.975]  These tweets probably opened for 10 years.
[02:02:54.375 --> 02:03:01.457]  Not one journalist thought, well, hey, you know, maybe I ought to do a little search on this guy because you and I... And what you said is so critical.
[02:03:01.497 --> 02:03:02.778]  I know the campaign knows that.
[02:03:02.838 --> 02:03:04.818]  That all the real news comes from the grassroots.
[02:03:05.219 --> 02:03:06.899]  That's how we're taking control of the narrative.
[02:03:06.939 --> 02:03:07.759]  That's what scares them.
[02:03:07.799 --> 02:03:08.299]  Exactly.
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:10.700]  That's where everything real is.
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:12.761]  That's the incubation chamber.
[02:03:14.170 --> 02:03:18.711]  Exactly, and if it weren't for us, and by the way, we're nothing.
[02:03:19.011 --> 02:03:22.752]  We're spokespeople for the great people watching and listening.
[02:03:23.032 --> 02:03:25.493]  They're the ones who emailed Disney.
[02:03:25.813 --> 02:03:30.814]  They're the ones who share the articles even though they're going to get censored and attack themselves.
[02:03:30.934 --> 02:03:35.836]  It's the audience that's critical and the fact that they're doing the research, they're giving us info, it's symbiotic.
[02:03:35.856 --> 02:03:36.436]  You're absolutely right.
[02:03:37.346 --> 02:03:40.589]  Yeah, without them we would just be guys, you know, talking to a camera.
[02:03:40.889 --> 02:03:44.852]  But they got on the email, they got on the phone, and they were saying, hey, hey, I have kids.
[02:03:45.333 --> 02:03:47.154]  I take my kids to Disney movies.
[02:03:47.895 --> 02:03:51.678]  Why in the world would you work with someone like James Gunn who said this stuff?
[02:03:51.718 --> 02:03:53.540]  Why would you endorse this?
[02:03:54.335 --> 02:03:55.276]  That was all us!
[02:03:55.536 --> 02:03:58.999]  I'm gonna come back after one minute and say bye to you, but let's play this clip going out to break.
[02:03:59.059 --> 02:03:59.559]  It's blurred.
[02:03:59.599 --> 02:04:00.560]  This is Dan Harmon.
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:01.581]  Showtime.
[02:04:02.221 --> 02:04:03.662]  Hiding in plain view on YouTube.
[02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:04.663]  Simulated rape of a baby.
[02:04:04.703 --> 02:04:05.304]  We've blurred it.
[02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:08.006]  They'll probably censor this, but leave the real thing up, but here it is.
[02:04:09.007 --> 02:04:11.829]  Thank you for being such a good patient.
[02:04:12.609 --> 02:04:15.332]  For taking all the sleeping pills I prescribed to you.
[02:04:16.873 --> 02:04:23.318]  So that later tonight, when I'm crawling in your window, I can count on you to sleep like a baby.
[02:04:27.398 --> 02:04:29.941]  Well, I do everything but sleep with yours.
[02:04:40.885 --> 02:04:41.746]  This is America.
[02:04:42.507 --> 02:04:43.388]  This is who they are.
[02:04:43.989 --> 02:04:45.051]  This is their soul sucking.
[02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:45.912]  Do a few more minutes.
[02:04:46.613 --> 02:04:57.107]  Mike Cernovich and then our other guest is joining us to look at how the radical Islamicist vein has the exact same pedophilic obsession and hence why they're merging with the satanic Hollywood global elite.
[02:04:57.508 --> 02:04:57.928]  They'll be back.
[02:04:57.948 --> 02:04:58.349]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.412 --> 02:05:06.475]  Anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[02:05:07.116 --> 02:05:12.279]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[02:05:12.639 --> 02:05:19.323]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines.
[02:05:20.044 --> 02:05:23.226]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[02:05:23.966 --> 02:05:27.669]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[02:05:28.209 --> 02:05:29.370]  And my only message is this.
[02:05:29.631 --> 02:05:32.693]  Everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[02:05:33.534 --> 02:05:40.999]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:44.382]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[02:05:44.402 --> 02:05:45.283]  We already have the power.
[02:05:45.303 --> 02:05:50.447]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[02:05:51.267 --> 02:05:53.709]  InfoWars is on the front line, and so are you.
[02:05:54.009 --> 02:05:55.310]  We are the resistance!
[02:05:55.330 --> 02:06:02.375]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:02.415 --> 02:06:04.636]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.005 --> 02:06:32.172]  Mike Cernovich, investigative journalist, lawyer, author, got a big film coming out, hoaxed.
[02:06:40.726 --> 02:06:46.588]  I just can't believe how Hollywood weighed in with the whole Me Too movement to cover up for Hillary and Bill's abuse of women.
[02:06:46.968 --> 02:06:47.989]  That blew up in their face.
[02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:51.770]  Now they're trying to moralize their whole pedophile situation has blown up in their face.
[02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:56.171]  They've just shadow banned you after you exposed the director gun promoting pedophilia.
[02:06:56.952 --> 02:07:00.553]  Now the rest of the media is jumping on it and every hour new stuff is breaking.
[02:07:00.973 --> 02:07:09.756]  But Dan Harmon deleting his Twitter, him doing simulated baby rape, Sarah Silverman praising pedophilia, you've got what it takes to be a pedophile.
[02:07:10.696 --> 02:07:14.157]  I mean these people are just truly evil people.
[02:07:14.577 --> 02:07:16.178]  That's not funny, that's just evil.
[02:07:16.658 --> 02:07:18.278]  What do you think the endgame is?
[02:07:18.338 --> 02:07:19.819]  How do we end up in some alternate
[02:07:21.018 --> 02:07:29.860]  HP Lovecraft novel, where America is run by a bunch of pedophiles, and every blue city is piles of feces, needles everywhere.
[02:07:29.881 --> 02:07:34.122]  I mean, what alternate dimension have we entered, and how do we get out of it?
[02:07:35.222 --> 02:07:39.783]  Well, we're entering the postmodern world, where you destroy beauty.
[02:07:39.803 --> 02:07:42.624]  I mean, you and I have talked about this so many times, where
[02:07:43.759 --> 02:07:49.461]  The end game for the world that they want to live in, 26 pounds of fecal matter in San Francisco.
[02:07:51.121 --> 02:07:55.563]  Everywhere you look in San Francisco, piles of it, piles of it.
[02:07:55.983 --> 02:07:58.644]  That is the end game of post-modernism.
[02:07:58.684 --> 02:08:00.764]  Destroy beauty, destroy God.
[02:08:01.004 --> 02:08:05.926]  That's why I tell people, even if you don't believe in God, you should go to church and pray and meditate and do things.
[02:08:07.026 --> 02:08:15.309]  The endgame is to destroy God, destroy the family unit, and then that's how the demons are able to prey on children because it's very easy.
[02:08:15.349 --> 02:08:17.110]  This is why they attack the family.
[02:08:17.850 --> 02:08:25.073]  They know that if they want to traffic children and be pedos, you have to get away from the nuclear family.
[02:08:25.393 --> 02:08:26.814]  You have to destroy the family.
[02:08:27.194 --> 02:08:29.575]  That way you have vulnerable people for them to prey on.
[02:08:29.835 --> 02:08:30.696]  So that's the endgame.
[02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:34.457]  It is truly, truly an action by pedophiles.
[02:08:34.677 --> 02:08:36.298]  Oh, by the way, before I go real quick,
[02:08:37.398 --> 02:08:38.519]  So much has happened, Alex.
[02:08:39.399 --> 02:08:48.024]  Remember when I went to the Columbia, I gave a Columbia University talk, and they held a... And Antifa came out with signs saying, we love pedophiles.
[02:08:48.104 --> 02:08:49.285]  And people said, oh, that's a joke.
[02:08:50.267 --> 02:08:55.293]  Right, well there was a fellow named Joel Davis who the Huffington Post published.
[02:08:55.733 --> 02:08:59.137]  Joel Davis organized that protest march against me.
[02:08:59.478 --> 02:09:04.083]  He is actually facing federal criminal charges for soliciting sex.
[02:09:04.143 --> 02:09:06.165]  He said he was into anyone zero plus.
[02:09:06.746 --> 02:09:08.388]  Anyone from zero to eight years old.
[02:09:11.311 --> 02:09:12.632]  There are a bunch of these university people.
[02:09:12.712 --> 02:09:14.113]  One of them ran a children's rights group.
[02:09:14.133 --> 02:09:16.234]  It was in the Philadelphia News.
[02:09:16.895 --> 02:09:21.218]  Is that the same guy that said he already had sex with a 9-year-old and a 13-year-old, but he wanted a 2-year-old?
[02:09:23.369 --> 02:09:24.510]  That was Joel Davis.
[02:09:25.050 --> 02:09:25.670]  Yeah, Joel Davis.
[02:09:25.690 --> 02:09:31.973]  Yeah, pull this guy up because he also, again, was running a human rights deal working with the Clintons.
[02:09:32.553 --> 02:09:40.617]  So, gosh, and now, I'm not going to pull it up because we're doing an investigation, but they're now all over the news going, oh, here's your school resource officer.
[02:09:40.637 --> 02:09:41.518]  Yeah, there he is.
[02:09:42.818 --> 02:09:53.947]  And they're going to do sexual education showing hardcore porn to your children, and then they go on and say, Mike Cernovich, they go on and say, I love pizza, I love pizza, all over the walls behind them.
[02:09:54.228 --> 02:09:55.709]  I mean, they're really sending some messages.
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:03.405]  Well, and what's amazing, too, about Joel Davis is he deleted his Instagram, which, by the way, was a breach of his bail agreement.
[02:10:03.745 --> 02:10:09.890]  So I've been in touch with prosecutors about that, because when you're a pedo, they say you cannot be on the Internet.
[02:10:09.930 --> 02:10:11.311]  So he deleted his Instagram.
[02:10:11.632 --> 02:10:19.778]  There was a picture of him at the Clinton campaign, and the media goes, oh, he had no—they fact-check, and they go, oh, he has no connection to the Clinton campaign.
[02:10:19.798 --> 02:10:20.378]  It's like, no!
[02:10:20.639 --> 02:10:24.422]  He had a picture of himself at the Clinton campaign on his Instagram.
[02:10:24.442 --> 02:10:25.983]  So that's how bad the lies are.
[02:10:26.303 --> 02:10:30.424]  Because even when you have their social media posts and they delete them, oh no, it never happened.
[02:10:30.484 --> 02:10:35.485]  And then, of course, if you see that Joel Davis picture again they just had, he's wearing a Disney button.
[02:10:36.666 --> 02:10:36.886]  Right?
[02:10:37.106 --> 02:10:38.046]  What's going on there?
[02:10:38.646 --> 02:10:39.686]  Was he infiltrating?
[02:10:40.106 --> 02:10:41.047]  You know, that's the whole thing.
[02:10:41.567 --> 02:10:43.827]  Yeah, so you can see this picture of Joel Davis.
[02:10:44.387 --> 02:10:47.648]  For those of you listening, he's wearing a Hillary Clinton button, stronger together.
[02:10:47.988 --> 02:10:51.589]  The media says, oh no, he was never a Hillary Clinton.
[02:10:51.869 --> 02:10:53.170]  Oh, and you know what else?
[02:10:53.290 --> 02:10:54.890]  He wrote an article for the Huffington Post.
[02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:59.516]  If you Google Joel Davis Huffington Post, he wrote it.
[02:10:59.596 --> 02:11:08.167]  So this is actually, we can say this truthfully, and Huffington Post can come after me if they want legally, published Huffington Post author.
[02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:11.402]  Faces child rape charges.
[02:11:11.882 --> 02:11:13.963]  Sue me, Huffington Post, because he's on your website.
[02:11:13.983 --> 02:11:14.644]  We have it linked.
[02:11:14.944 --> 02:11:15.804]  We have a screen cap.
[02:11:16.045 --> 02:11:19.546]  So the Huffington Post gave this pedophile a platform.
[02:11:19.987 --> 02:11:20.847]  That is a fact.
[02:11:21.267 --> 02:11:22.388]  That's what we're up against.
[02:11:22.648 --> 02:11:26.090]  The media, they're all in on it, and that's why they're attacking me at the Huffington Post.
[02:11:26.350 --> 02:11:30.872]  Because I reported on the fact that they published an article by a pedophile.
[02:11:31.172 --> 02:11:33.854]  So they go, well, oh, we'll try to kill the message.
[02:11:33.974 --> 02:11:36.155]  By the way, we've seen Salon, we've seen
[02:11:37.175 --> 02:11:41.698]  HBO, we've seen Vice, we've seen the New York Times say pedophilia is actually not bad.
[02:11:42.299 --> 02:11:43.700]  Standard NAMBLA statement.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:46.061]  And so let me ask you this question.
[02:11:46.682 --> 02:11:51.705]  What percentage of these people, I guess they're just all in a deviance, evil, having power over people.
[02:11:52.045 --> 02:11:55.568]  Statistics show liberals are what, six times more likely
[02:11:56.641 --> 02:12:00.929]  To steal nine times more likely to virtue signal and not give to charity.
[02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:03.795]  Is this just the constituency of evil now?
[02:12:03.815 --> 02:12:06.721]  Because liberals weren't like this 20 years ago, at least what I thought.
[02:12:06.741 --> 02:12:08.184]  I mean, what do you think's going on here?
[02:12:09.090 --> 02:12:17.035]  Yeah, this is the end result of post-Marxism, post-structuralism, post-modernism, liberalism.
[02:12:17.255 --> 02:12:20.397]  And this is the problem, and this is why people who are on the center left.
[02:12:20.857 --> 02:12:22.158]  So I want to be very clear.
[02:12:22.518 --> 02:12:26.040]  I would say only 10% of Democrats support pedophilia.
[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:30.583]  90% of Democrats, they only watch CNN, so they don't know this is happening.
[02:12:30.943 --> 02:12:31.103]  Right?
[02:12:31.143 --> 02:12:32.424]  Because they live in a media bubble.
[02:12:32.684 --> 02:12:35.886]  So if you watch CNN... But their movement is commanded by pedophiles.
[02:12:37.819 --> 02:12:39.960]  So this is why I feel bad for Democrats.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:45.223]  They don't know this because they watch, they read the Huffington Post.
[02:12:45.603 --> 02:12:47.344]  They watch CNN.
[02:12:47.685 --> 02:12:52.908]  So they don't know that they're being ordered around and led by pedophiles.
[02:12:52.928 --> 02:12:55.629]  90% of Democrats, I truly believe it, I make a lot of people mad.
[02:12:55.649 --> 02:12:56.570]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:12:56.590 --> 02:12:59.591]  They're anti-war, they're decent people, they mean well, they believe the lies.
[02:12:59.611 --> 02:13:01.893]  But what percentage of the top 10% are pedophiles?
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:08.501]  Oh, I would say, um, Democrat leadership, at least 10% of them are pedophiles, at least.
[02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:11.381]  And then the others are using it to compromise people.
[02:13:12.422 --> 02:13:15.882]  Exactly, and blackmailing people, and covering things up.
[02:13:16.242 --> 02:13:23.664]  And let's not forget, Mueller for a decade, knew Epstein was kidnapping children, flying them to sex stuff, and use it to compromise.
[02:13:23.724 --> 02:13:27.104]  I mean, Mueller is a manifest monster.
[02:13:28.564 --> 02:13:30.045]  Well, and not- Mueller.
[02:13:30.065 --> 02:13:31.205]  I always call him Mueller.
[02:13:32.054 --> 02:13:34.457]  I call him Mueller because he's like a dumb mule.
[02:13:34.897 --> 02:13:36.579]  But there was more than that.
[02:13:36.639 --> 02:13:46.789]  There was a person in San Francisco caught with a whole treasure trove of child pornography, and that was covered up also by Mueller.
[02:13:46.869 --> 02:13:48.651]  So yeah, they have a track record.
[02:13:48.871 --> 02:13:54.677]  And we've had 16 major Democrat mayors, including Seattle, all resign in the last year for being caught to be pedophiles.
[02:13:55.649 --> 02:14:00.312]  Oh, Joel, um, so there's another guy, Jacob Schwartz, who was a CNN guest.
[02:14:00.632 --> 02:14:03.093]  You can't, I mean, this is the whole thing, Alex, it's so weird.
[02:14:03.453 --> 02:14:05.895]  There's a guy, that's why they go, Cernovich, you're always so excited.
[02:14:05.915 --> 02:14:10.277]  I'm like, well, because there's so much, I'm like, Cassandra, I'm like, I know all this stuff.
[02:14:10.337 --> 02:14:15.000]  No, it's very frustrating when we know, and it's like, as a normal person, you're like, another pedophile?
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:15.600]  It's like, really?
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:16.461]  Pedophiles everywhere?
[02:14:16.741 --> 02:14:18.342]  You don't believe it, even though you know it.
[02:14:18.382 --> 02:14:20.383]  It's like, who the hell are these people?
[02:14:21.294 --> 02:14:28.619]  Bill de Blasio's top aide, google this right now, Jacob Schwartz, G-A-C-O-B-S- And they've been covering up all his pedophile stuff.
[02:14:29.099 --> 02:14:36.725]  Yeah, so Jacob Schwartz, Bill de Blasio's top aide, he was the president of the Manhattan Young Democrats, and he was a guest on CNN.
[02:14:37.992 --> 02:14:38.353]  Right.
[02:14:38.933 --> 02:14:43.479]  Charged with possessing thousands, thousands of images.
[02:14:43.779 --> 02:14:45.461]  And you know what they've done for him, Alex?
[02:14:45.501 --> 02:14:49.045]  The sneaky little judges and his little well-connected friends?
[02:14:49.506 --> 02:14:50.667]  They let him out on bail.
[02:14:50.687 --> 02:14:50.787]  $7,500 bail.
[02:14:53.164 --> 02:14:57.448]  And it's been over a year he's been out and they haven't made him take a plea deal.
[02:14:57.468 --> 02:14:58.649]  They haven't put him to trial.
[02:14:58.929 --> 02:15:02.212]  They just keep letting him run free hoping nobody will actually notice.
[02:15:02.252 --> 02:15:03.513]  You know what unifies all this?
[02:15:03.653 --> 02:15:09.658]  They all are weak little chicken neck cowards and they can't deal with the real women and so they love the power over children.
[02:15:09.678 --> 02:15:10.098]  That's what it is.
[02:15:10.138 --> 02:15:12.620]  These are disgusting demon possessed worms.
[02:15:12.921 --> 02:15:14.362]  Mike Cernovich, Cernovich.com.
[02:15:14.662 --> 02:15:15.363]  Thank you so much.
[02:15:15.423 --> 02:15:16.824]  Powerful hour and 15 minutes.
[02:15:17.344 --> 02:15:18.666]  We really appreciate you and
[02:15:19.486 --> 02:15:22.731]  It's a real honor that you join us now and being shadow banned on your Twitter.
[02:15:23.112 --> 02:15:24.694]  So that means you're definitely over the target.
[02:15:24.734 --> 02:15:25.575]  Cernovich.com.
[02:15:25.775 --> 02:15:26.617]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[02:15:27.537 --> 02:15:27.977]  My pleasure.
[02:15:28.658 --> 02:15:29.338]  That's powerful.
[02:15:29.558 --> 02:15:33.560]  And that mainstream media now defending pedophiles attacking Mike Cernovich.
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:36.801]  They go, yeah, they're talking about raping kids, but he's bad to do it.
[02:15:37.161 --> 02:15:38.242]  Mike Cernovich is the bad guy.
[02:15:38.282 --> 02:15:39.022]  I'm the bad guy, too.
[02:15:39.062 --> 02:15:40.923]  Well, say goodnight to the bad guy.
[02:15:40.943 --> 02:15:42.824]  We got our big guest from Westmonster.
[02:15:42.844 --> 02:15:44.104]  I'm saying Westminster.
[02:15:44.465 --> 02:15:50.367]  Westmonster doing great work over there in the UK covering the globalist Islamic invasion, the ashen attacks on three-year-olds.
[02:15:50.767 --> 02:15:52.148]  It's all coming up on the other side.
[02:15:52.288 --> 02:15:54.029]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:54.089 --> 02:15:56.010]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:15:59.787 --> 02:16:10.716]  Any student of military history, in all of recorded time, will tell you that stealth and sneak attack is absolutely critical in any offensive war.
[02:16:12.017 --> 02:16:15.860]  The Democrats, the CHICOM's funding them, Hollywood,
[02:16:16.854 --> 02:16:29.009]  The whole EU unelected bureaucracy is in a combine against nation states and against free market capitalism in a global corporate takeover backed up by paramilitary UN force.
[02:16:29.770 --> 02:16:30.711]  NATO is their army.
[02:16:31.212 --> 02:16:31.612]  Right now!
[02:16:32.313 --> 02:16:34.514]  The Democrats are making their move.
[02:16:35.495 --> 02:16:44.299]  For the last year and a half, in policy papers, they said we're going to overthrow the President using the military, or using 25th Amendment, and we're going to build the case through made-up Russia collusion.
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:52.684]  When I would point out the white papers, they'd say, oh, that's crazy, it doesn't exist, because they wanted to build up their forces and get geared up and get ready to make their move.
[02:16:52.964 --> 02:16:57.667]  Now, that President Trump's been in a little over a year and a half, and we enter the summer of rage,
[02:16:58.547 --> 02:17:11.393]  Congressmen, Senators, former CIA Deputy Directors, FBI Deputy Directors, you name it, former CIA Directors, they're all over the news saying, we're making our move, Trump is a Russian agent, we're going to remove him from office.
[02:17:11.813 --> 02:17:22.858]  This is insane, and they've got a bunch of cowardly Republicans who want to sit on the fence, in case this coup is successful, going, oh yeah, maybe it is bad he met with Putin, maybe he is selling us out.
[02:17:23.698 --> 02:17:26.659]  Trump has been crushing Russia with our energy deals.
[02:17:27.079 --> 02:17:32.401]  Trump has been crushing Russia shipping heavy anti-tank weapons into Ukraine against the Russians.
[02:17:32.862 --> 02:17:34.682]  Trump has been putting massive sanctions on them.
[02:17:35.002 --> 02:17:39.324]  But his rhetoric is friendly to make Russia capitulate and make a deal.
[02:17:39.724 --> 02:17:43.025]  And quite frankly, it's offensive and probably not right what the president's doing.
[02:17:43.346 --> 02:17:46.807]  But you can see it in America's interest, but kind of in an imperial way.
[02:17:47.327 --> 02:17:49.511]  Trump is so pro-America, it's insane.
[02:17:49.551 --> 02:17:51.193]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[02:17:51.393 --> 02:17:52.615]  The economy's turning around.
[02:17:52.996 --> 02:17:59.166]  The traitors of globalism in the Democratic Party and the blue-blood Republicans are the ones that are anti-nation-state.
[02:17:59.506 --> 02:18:02.330]  They're the ones transferring power to the UN and the TPP.
[02:18:02.811 --> 02:18:03.932]  All the things Trump's killed.
[02:18:04.152 --> 02:18:11.797]  America was basically wearing a ball and chain, and Trump has removed it, and he's returning power back to the states, back to the people.
[02:18:12.037 --> 02:18:13.598]  He's acting as our real president.
[02:18:13.939 --> 02:18:16.520]  Even if you don't agree with some of what he says or does, it doesn't matter.
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:18.061]  He really is the president now.
[02:18:18.442 --> 02:18:25.566]  And the bureaucracy, and the lobbyists, and the globalists, and the chi-coms that own our debt and control Hollywood, thought they had this country.
[02:18:25.906 --> 02:18:31.130]  The communist Chinese newspapers admit they're at war with us right now, economically and building up militarily.
[02:18:31.410 --> 02:18:32.211]  They're the big threat.
[02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:35.112]  Russia can't even keep its own country together.
[02:18:35.393 --> 02:18:37.714]  It's being targeted by Soros just like we are.
[02:18:38.194 --> 02:18:42.977]  And that's the only truth in the Russian collusion, is that Russia has the same enemies that America has.
[02:18:43.457 --> 02:18:45.599]  And Russia is being targeted just like we are.
[02:18:45.879 --> 02:18:49.161]  And they're making their move against the President right now.
[02:18:49.781 --> 02:18:56.785]  They've been hyping it and, you know, pushing that they're going to remove him so long to get you punch drunk before they finally make their move.
[02:18:57.145 --> 02:19:02.707]  But all of us, as Americans, need to understand they've tried to create race wars, class wars, sex wars.
[02:19:02.747 --> 02:19:04.408]  They've tried to divide us every way they can.
[02:19:04.688 --> 02:19:05.669]  They admit they're doing it.
[02:19:06.029 --> 02:19:06.950]  They are the globalists.
[02:19:07.010 --> 02:19:07.630]  They are the enemy.
[02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:22.701]  And it's up to us to call Congress, to call talk radio, to get involved more now than ever against all the internet censorship that they're trying to bring in ahead of a coup against the president and a coup against the electorate in this country that elected him.
[02:19:23.141 --> 02:19:31.588]  This is a war against America trying to have its own self-determination, just like Theresa May is trying to say they're not going to follow the vote for Brexit right now in England.
[02:19:32.048 --> 02:19:32.689]  We're good to go.
[02:20:03.317 --> 02:20:06.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:11.585 --> 02:20:22.476]  Alright, Alex Jones here live.
[02:20:22.716 --> 02:20:27.521]  We've got Patrick Christie from West Monster, westmonster.com.
[02:20:29.244 --> 02:20:31.726]  He's worked for a lot of big major newspapers in the UK.
[02:20:31.886 --> 02:20:34.528]  Now he's their main investigative journalist breaking news.
[02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:41.373]  Reporter, prior to that he was the youngest ever online editor of two national newspapers, the Daily Express and the Daily Star.
[02:20:42.034 --> 02:20:44.075]  The Daily Express has a lot of really powerful stuff in it.
[02:20:44.916 --> 02:20:46.918]  He's reported from Syria, Iraq, Turkey.
[02:20:46.958 --> 02:20:48.919]  I'm not going to get into the military coups he's covered.
[02:20:48.959 --> 02:20:52.182]  He's an on-the-ground investigative journalist and he's here to get into Brexit.
[02:20:52.822 --> 02:20:54.863]  He's here to get into just the state of Europe.
[02:20:54.903 --> 02:20:56.184]  I mean, look at these headlines I've got.
[02:20:56.924 --> 02:21:00.806]  One killed, 14 wounded after a gunman opens fire in Toronto.
[02:21:00.966 --> 02:21:04.088]  Islamic terrorists suspected, but you notice it's Islamic, they're shutting it down.
[02:21:04.548 --> 02:21:07.690]  Three men arrested over acid attack on three-year-old baby boy.
[02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:09.051]  That's out of Reuters.
[02:21:09.131 --> 02:21:11.152]  I mean, they have like seven acid attacks a day now.
[02:21:12.433 --> 02:21:12.893]  in London.
[02:21:13.373 --> 02:21:14.974]  Dirty, stinking Belgian.
[02:21:15.014 --> 02:21:19.556]  The Islamists scream as the gang pelts handicapped old lady with stones.
[02:21:20.156 --> 02:21:22.337]  That's Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com.
[02:21:22.777 --> 02:21:26.098]  And Sweden teaching migrants how to have sex with blondes.
[02:21:26.158 --> 02:21:29.059]  They teach teenage girls to get your Muslim boyfriend.
[02:21:29.959 --> 02:21:32.480]  They actually say that Muslims are allowed to have sex with kids.
[02:21:33.781 --> 02:21:35.741]  So, you got that weird thing going on.
[02:21:35.781 --> 02:21:37.122]  It just keeps popping up.
[02:21:38.194 --> 02:21:40.395]  So Patrick Christie, thank you for joining us.
[02:21:40.415 --> 02:21:44.656]  There's so much to cover there at Westmonster that we link to all the time.
[02:21:45.176 --> 02:21:46.377]  Westmonster.com.
[02:21:46.817 --> 02:21:48.777]  What do you think the main issue is right now?
[02:21:48.877 --> 02:21:50.878]  Brexit or the Islamic invasion?
[02:21:50.918 --> 02:21:52.258]  And we know phase two is happening.
[02:21:52.779 --> 02:21:53.759]  What's front and center for you?
[02:21:54.781 --> 02:22:00.904]  I mean, front and centre for me on the day-to-day is the Brexit stuff, but it's a wider context of what's going on in Europe generally.
[02:22:00.944 --> 02:22:08.247]  It's the breakdown of Europe and the rebellion of people against this kind of centralisation of unaccountable power and the establishment elite.
[02:22:08.287 --> 02:22:14.070]  But then on top of that we do have this radical Islamist terror that's sweeping the continent.
[02:22:14.490 --> 02:22:15.631]  In Britain, for example.
[02:22:16.255 --> 02:22:31.492]  People don't know this a lot of the time, but Britain's let in a higher percentage of returning ISIS fighters, Islamic State fighters, to people that were British citizens that have travelled abroad to Syria, Iraq, to fight for ISIS, which we all know is a death cult, you know, a horrible death cult.
[02:22:31.512 --> 02:22:36.258]  They throw people off buildings, they're paedophiles, they're murderers, they're depraved people.
[02:22:37.299 --> 02:22:42.263]  425 of those have come back into Britain and none of them, to our knowledge so far, have been prosecuted.
[02:22:42.683 --> 02:22:48.889]  That is absolutely ridiculous, but yet we are prosecuting people who go to fight against ISIS fighters abroad.
[02:22:48.929 --> 02:22:52.572]  Now if you mirror this across Europe, the fact is unfortunately now we have this
[02:22:53.112 --> 02:23:00.275]  This stockpile almost of radicals that are just living among the normal European society and that's having an impact.
[02:23:00.295 --> 02:23:01.875]  That's why we're seeing these terror attacks.
[02:23:02.215 --> 02:23:05.016]  That's why we're seeing a general level of fear across the continent.
[02:23:05.076 --> 02:23:11.619]  But in Britain specifically, you may not know this again, there are 23,000 people currently on a terror watch list.
[02:23:11.999 --> 02:23:17.021]  You know, the UK is the size of a small American state pretty much and that's pretty horrifying for me anyway.
[02:23:18.066 --> 02:23:24.472]  That's right, and I see where they get even better welfare, better Section 8 housing, or council estates, whatever you call them over there.
[02:23:24.492 --> 02:23:29.416]  I mean, and Patrick Christie's with an S joins us from westmonster.com.
[02:23:30.077 --> 02:23:31.418]  What do you think the endgame is?
[02:23:31.438 --> 02:23:36.903]  I mean, we know that Peter Sutherland, who died this year at the UN, wanted to merge it with the Middle East, North Africa, but
[02:23:37.603 --> 02:23:39.685]  I mean, it's giant groups of people.
[02:23:39.745 --> 02:23:45.690]  I was reading like 90% of people in five years, in Europe particularly, on the continent, don't even get a job.
[02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:48.372]  And then if you do try to get a job, that's who they deport.
[02:23:48.432 --> 02:23:51.435]  So they want a bunch of people sitting around on welfare.
[02:23:53.256 --> 02:23:53.557]  Why?
[02:23:54.177 --> 02:23:56.739]  What is the EU super state looking for?
[02:23:56.779 --> 02:24:01.023]  Just have a client group that is totally dependent, who will burn down cities if they give them the order?
[02:24:02.057 --> 02:24:05.260]  Well, there's a couple of factors at play here, I believe, Alex, anyway.
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:08.803]  I think that the European Union wants to break down the idea of the nation-state.
[02:24:08.863 --> 02:24:11.205]  We know that because they want the United States of Europe.
[02:24:11.625 --> 02:24:15.188]  They want an EU-wide army, so they don't want nations to have their own army.
[02:24:15.228 --> 02:24:17.370]  They don't want nations to have their own borders, of course.
[02:24:17.430 --> 02:24:23.616]  Now on the continent of Europe, the mainland continent of Europe, there is an open border system, basically.
[02:24:23.976 --> 02:24:29.621]  And so I think one of the elements of having this aiding and abetting this migrant crisis, as it's being called,
[02:24:29.961 --> 02:24:32.582]  The European Union, by the way, sells inflatable dinghies.
[02:24:32.642 --> 02:24:34.282]  I don't know if that's one that's on your screen now.
[02:24:34.722 --> 02:24:39.163]  They sell inflatable dinghies to Libya, where, of course, a lot of the migrants are coming from.
[02:24:39.223 --> 02:24:50.526]  Now, I don't want to get too radical about it, but it does certainly seem that it would fit in with their idea of breaking down this idea of national identity, national sovereignty in the nation state.
[02:24:50.926 --> 02:24:52.767]  If you do have a big influx of people from
[02:24:53.107 --> 02:24:56.328]  A complete and utter variety of cultures, very different cultures, etc.
[02:24:56.949 --> 02:25:05.272]  And that would go towards, it would seem, you know, contributing towards creating a Europe-wide country as opposed to anyone with a distinct national identity.
[02:25:05.312 --> 02:25:08.693]  And so I think that's definitely got a factor to play in it as well.
[02:25:08.953 --> 02:25:11.875]  The other element of it is I just think they've bitten off more than they can chew.
[02:25:11.895 --> 02:25:17.817]  They don't have the capabilities, they don't have the resources to actively defend their own borders and so they've given up.
[02:25:18.717 --> 02:25:19.677]  Well I think that's it.
[02:25:19.717 --> 02:25:26.140]  You see the UN saying we'll build the refugee centres inside Europe, not in Africa, not in the Middle East.
[02:25:26.180 --> 02:25:31.283]  They're creating the crisis that will call for the EU army to fix the problem they created.
[02:25:31.763 --> 02:25:32.223]  This is it.
[02:25:32.623 --> 02:25:33.824]  There's very interesting facts here.
[02:25:33.844 --> 02:25:40.146]  So I went, as you mentioned before, I went to Turkey, I went to... a refugee comes on the Syrian border, on the Iraqi border.
[02:25:40.186 --> 02:25:45.829]  Now I spoke to refugees there, I spoke to them in person, right from children up the way through to the adults that were with them.
[02:25:46.269 --> 02:25:57.716]  They told me that they would rather stay in those camps on the border of their home country, because actually, as far as they were concerned, they would quite like to return one day when the fighting stops, or if the fighting ever stops, of course.
[02:25:58.156 --> 02:26:11.703]  So, this idea that we have to permanently displace them, and place them all the way in the centre of Europe, the heartland of Europe, for no reason, really, is alien to me, and it doesn't seem that it's something that these people, a lot of them, particularly want themselves.
[02:26:11.743 --> 02:26:14.445]  So again, of course, it poses the question, why do it, really?
[02:26:14.605 --> 02:26:30.633]  That's right, they're forcing the migration corridors from Latin America into the U.S., out of North Africa and the Middle East and Central Asia into Europe as an admitted plan, as Macron has said, as Sutherland has said, as the U.N.
[02:26:30.653 --> 02:26:32.734]  has said, to quote, repopulate Europe.
[02:26:33.174 --> 02:26:40.158]  But when they get there, they're not trying to make them absorb the culture, they're trying to make them keep their own culture as really a political detonator, a checkmate
[02:26:41.018 --> 02:26:41.858]  For full control.
[02:26:41.878 --> 02:27:03.145]  This is a very very diabolical plan and then let's let's not forget it was the EU and Obama seven years ago that admittedly with Google launched the Arab Spring to destabilize many of these countries to take down Libya to then begin the collapse of North Africa and the Middle East to create the war-torn refugees to start the invasion.
[02:27:03.406 --> 02:27:04.706]  So it's very premeditated.
[02:27:06.423 --> 02:27:12.708]  Well, we've certainly had a hand in the direct causes of this migrant crisis from start to finish, going back, well, decades now, you know?
[02:27:13.168 --> 02:27:15.049]  And so we have had a hand to play in that.
[02:27:15.369 --> 02:27:19.693]  And you touched on an important issue there, I think, Alex, and that is the issue of integration.
[02:27:19.753 --> 02:27:27.178]  Now, it's very, very unfortunate that there has been no efforts, particularly in Britain, certainly not as much of a concerted effort as I think there should have been.
[02:27:27.598 --> 02:27:29.319]  To force through some elements of integration.
[02:27:29.339 --> 02:27:32.800]  And what that creates, of course, is societies within societies.
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:36.421]  And in Britain, we allow people to have Sharia courts.
[02:27:36.821 --> 02:27:40.022]  So the rules that they would choose to live by, say, in Saudi Arabia, etc.
[02:27:40.382 --> 02:27:42.283]  We allow them to have those courts over here.
[02:27:42.323 --> 02:27:45.184]  Now that creates a complete separation in society.
[02:27:45.204 --> 02:27:49.325]  And over time, it builds up with hundreds of thousands of people living in pockets.
[02:27:49.645 --> 02:27:51.546]  Societies within societies, as I've said.
[02:27:51.866 --> 02:27:54.547]  Oh, they were just denied two years ago no-go zones.
[02:27:54.927 --> 02:27:55.907]  Now it's admitted everywhere.
[02:27:57.358 --> 02:28:00.600]  Well, I mean, personally, look, I went to a place in Birmingham a year or so ago.
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:03.602]  I was investigating a terrorist, the London Bridge terrorist.
[02:28:03.622 --> 02:28:10.986]  You may remember a guy who drove a van down a road outside Parliament, killed loads of people, stabbed a police officer to death, tried to storm the Parliament building.
[02:28:11.286 --> 02:28:13.788]  This guy, Khaled Massoud, he was called.
[02:28:13.808 --> 02:28:16.689]  I went to investigate him, and I got into his house in Birmingham, actually.
[02:28:16.709 --> 02:28:21.792]  I got into his house, and he had flatmates who, actually, to be fair on them, just genuinely didn't know anything about it.
[02:28:21.912 --> 02:28:24.774]  It was like a single room in a pretty squalid flat this guy lived in.
[02:28:25.174 --> 02:28:31.758]  Well, I spoke to them and I went down and walked down a place in Birmingham, a road called Alum Rock Road and people say it's not a no-go zone.
[02:28:32.079 --> 02:28:33.600]  I'm telling you it is a no-go zone.
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:40.604]  It's a no-go zone and we know it is because when I walked down, I got racially abused and the white girl that I was with got racially abused as well.
[02:28:40.624 --> 02:28:41.865]  They said, welcome to Alum Rock.
[02:28:42.225 --> 02:28:49.710]  Let's talk about where this is going, where the EU, the globalists want to go, versus where you think historically it is going and the people's choice here.
[02:28:49.730 --> 02:28:54.073]  Straight ahead with Patrick Christies of WestMonster.com.
[02:28:54.173 --> 02:28:55.554]  WestMonster.com.
[02:28:55.854 --> 02:28:56.335]  We'll be back.
[02:28:56.475 --> 02:28:57.515]  InfoWars.com.
[02:28:57.535 --> 02:28:58.116]  Spread those links.
[02:28:59.861 --> 02:29:03.985]  This country is now officially in a state of civil war.
[02:29:04.765 --> 02:29:12.772]  Multiple members of Congress, rabid Democrats, have called for a military coup against President Donald J. Trump.
[02:29:13.213 --> 02:29:22.200]  We also have former Deputy Director of the FBI and Deputy Director of the CIA coming out and calling for the, quote, deep state to remove the President.
[02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:30.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you saw that going on in Russia, our news media would accurately say that they were in a state of civil war.
[02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:34.315]  If you saw that happening in the EU, that would be an accurate assumption.
[02:29:34.795 --> 02:29:41.643]  Even a few weeks ago, USA Today interviewed professors that said they believe we were already in the early stages of a civil war.
[02:29:42.564 --> 02:29:52.328]  I have been ridiculed for pointing out the Democrats the last year and a half were quietly planning it in their own policy papers funded by George Soros and others.
[02:29:52.669 --> 02:29:56.470]  But now it's out in the open and this country is in maximum danger.
[02:29:57.091 --> 02:30:04.314]  They are trying to induce Trump derangement syndrome onto CNN and MSNBC and NPR audiences.
[02:30:05.194 --> 02:30:22.440]  To believe the hysteria that Russia wants to build walls, that Russia wants to expand our military, that Russia wants to bring our economy back, that Russia wants to devastate its own oil and gas imports as Trump has done, that Russia wants Trump to ship anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to attack Russians?
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:28.224]  The truth is, Trump's been too hardcore on Russia because Russia hasn't done anything to the U.S.
[02:30:28.744 --> 02:30:34.769]  It's the communist Chinese that are on record owning Hollywood, owning our national debt, and trying to basically break this country up.
[02:30:35.069 --> 02:30:36.390]  They're allied with the Democrats.
[02:30:36.690 --> 02:30:37.511]  They're the real traitors.
[02:30:37.951 --> 02:30:49.340]  That's why Congressman Stephen Cohen has called for a military coup against the president, because he is a traitor, working with the chi-coms, working with the multinational corporations.
[02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:58.002]  That's why Phil Mudd of the CIA and the FBI has come out on CNN just last night and said Trump is a traitor.
[02:30:58.062 --> 02:31:06.144]  He needs to be overthrown for meeting with the Russian leader and being nice, at least in the things he said, but not in Trump's actions.
[02:31:06.304 --> 02:31:06.944]  It's incredible.
[02:31:07.364 --> 02:31:11.825]  And then we've got, of course, rabid wolf Blitzer attacking Senator Rand Paul.
[02:31:12.105 --> 02:31:12.565]  We're good to go.
[02:31:42.614 --> 02:31:48.336]  25th Amendment invoked, and they're calling for people inside Trump's cabinet to call for him to be removed.
[02:31:48.716 --> 02:31:50.697]  This isn't just a civil war they've kicked off.
[02:31:51.117 --> 02:32:05.402]  It is an attempted coup that is in plain view, and the public and everyone else must respond by calling Congress, calling the president, and calling other individuals in our government and telling them, stand by the election, stand by the voters, stand by the republic.
[02:32:05.742 --> 02:32:07.242]  My goodness, the country's coming back.
[02:32:07.363 --> 02:32:08.543]  So many great things are happening.
[02:32:08.743 --> 02:32:11.484]  We're making the nation great again, and these traitors can't stand it.
[02:32:11.824 --> 02:32:14.807]  That said, InfoWars is under unprecedented attack as well.
[02:32:15.267 --> 02:32:18.810]  As you see thousands of articles a week saying, shut us down, take us off the air.
[02:32:19.151 --> 02:32:27.178]  Without you spreading the word, the articles, the videos, without you buying products at InfoWarsStore.com, they will defeat us as a key outpost in the fight against globalism.
[02:32:27.278 --> 02:32:27.958]  Spread the article.
[02:32:28.018 --> 02:32:28.899]  Spread the videos.

[02:32:51.508 --> 02:32:57.130]  But now it's more critical than ever to go to InfoWarStore.com and support the Info War while getting great products.
[02:32:57.370 --> 02:32:58.211]  God bless you all.
[02:33:03.373 --> 02:33:06.214]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.951 --> 02:33:25.114]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:25.835 --> 02:33:27.316]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.019 --> 02:33:43.588]  Look, if you're a big multinational corporation, like Apple, Google, Twitter, Facebook, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, you are totally cold-blooded.
[02:33:43.788 --> 02:33:45.490]  You want total consolidation of power.
[02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:50.705]  You don't like the West, you don't like free market, uppity middle class people that always want more, more, more.
[02:33:50.725 --> 02:33:51.546]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:33:51.906 --> 02:33:54.549]  Hillary going, God, my constituents always want more stuff.
[02:33:54.869 --> 02:33:55.970]  Bunch of stupid baristas.
[02:33:56.611 --> 02:33:58.773]  Well, I don't think you're a bad person if you're a barista.
[02:33:59.253 --> 02:34:00.255]  That's a hard working job.
[02:34:00.275 --> 02:34:02.076]  A lot of barbistas, barbistas.
[02:34:02.757 --> 02:34:05.678]  I mean, bartenders make $100,000 a year, whatever.
[02:34:05.998 --> 02:34:10.159]  I respect somebody that owns their own lawnmowering company and has five guys working for them.
[02:34:10.179 --> 02:34:12.259]  I respect somebody that owns a little corner store.
[02:34:12.279 --> 02:34:17.620]  I respect somebody that owns a machine shop, or an auto body shop, or a little dentist place, or a farmer.
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:21.821]  I respect just regular people, but see, these elitists, they don't think that about you.
[02:34:23.841 --> 02:34:31.663]  And they look at the demographics of there being 1.8 billion Muslims, and it's about to be 3 billion by the end of the next decade,
[02:34:32.557 --> 02:34:38.080]  And they look at Christians being a billion six hundred thousand or whatever.
[02:34:39.021 --> 02:34:41.302]  And they look at the numbers and they just say, we're going with Islam.
[02:34:41.322 --> 02:34:42.243]  They're having six kids.
[02:34:42.763 --> 02:34:44.324]  Christians are having 1.3 kids.
[02:34:45.005 --> 02:34:45.465]  That's the number.
[02:34:46.766 --> 02:34:48.467]  You got two parents, they have 1.3 kids.
[02:34:48.827 --> 02:34:50.128]  The media always makes dumb jokes.
[02:34:50.148 --> 02:34:51.969]  Goes, how do two people have 1.3?
[02:34:52.289 --> 02:34:53.570]  It's an average out of millions.
[02:34:54.370 --> 02:34:56.452]  And you look at this.
[02:34:58.255 --> 02:35:00.896]  And listen, I don't want to go conquer the Muslims.
[02:35:00.916 --> 02:35:02.377]  I don't hate Muslims on average.
[02:35:02.417 --> 02:35:09.200]  Our government keeps kicking out the non-radicals, putting radicals in, because they want this weapon to take us over, and then they think they'll control that.
[02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:12.161]  I think they won't even be able to control it.
[02:35:12.261 --> 02:35:13.121]  I think this is out of control.
[02:35:13.141 --> 02:35:14.962]  And so is the President.
[02:35:14.982 --> 02:35:20.904]  So we have one of the top investigative journalists at westmonster.com, Patrick Christie's on with us.
[02:35:20.964 --> 02:35:27.447]  Big investigative journalist, be sure and check out his bio and the work he's doing at Patrick Christie's on Twitter before he gets shadowbanned.
[02:35:28.686 --> 02:35:32.830]  But here's a new article on Infowars.com and Newswars.com by Ben Warren.
[02:35:34.331 --> 02:35:52.947]  Now we know President Trump wasn't just responding to the Ayatollah of Rock and Rolla over there, the hereditary Islamic dictator of the Islamic State of Iran, saying that he, you know, better watch out mother all battles or whatever.
[02:35:54.388 --> 02:35:56.190]  We now know the former head of the Republican Guard
[02:35:57.813 --> 02:36:03.277]  of Hezbollah, of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, threatened Trump in a tweet, and that's what Trump was responding to.
[02:36:03.337 --> 02:36:04.218]  No one's picked this up.
[02:36:04.258 --> 02:36:04.918]  We've confirmed it.
[02:36:05.318 --> 02:36:06.579]  It's on newswars.com.
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:10.502]  Iranian politician threatens Trump, says 50,000 U.S.
[02:36:10.522 --> 02:36:11.903]  troops in firing range.
[02:36:12.544 --> 02:36:14.285]  Oh no, don't kill our troops.
[02:36:16.026 --> 02:36:19.829]  I mean, I don't want our troops to die, but you think like the U.S.
[02:36:19.889 --> 02:36:21.130]  is afraid of troops getting killed?
[02:36:22.369 --> 02:36:24.370]  I mean, put us in the briar patch.
[02:36:24.750 --> 02:36:29.071]  I don't want a war with Iran, let's be clear, but this is getting ridiculous.
[02:36:29.091 --> 02:36:31.932]  I mean, we have enough nukes to blow the planet up like 10 times.
[02:36:32.232 --> 02:36:37.753]  The US admitted 15 years ago that we have antimatter weapons that can blow up the whole solar system, jackass!
[02:36:38.433 --> 02:36:43.635]  You sit over there with your little RPGs and, you know, have sex with your sister.
[02:36:44.821 --> 02:36:45.861]  Morons, excuse me.
[02:36:46.361 --> 02:36:58.124]  The Iranian politician reportedly told President Trump that 50,000 American troops are within Iran's firing range, hours after Trump told Iran's president to never threaten the United States again.
[02:36:58.164 --> 02:37:08.927]  The former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander-in-chief, Mohsen Rezani, appears to have tweeted at Trump, says he needs to be more cautious because 50,000 U.S.
[02:37:08.947 --> 02:37:10.367]  troops are under Iran's sword.
[02:37:11.207 --> 02:37:12.349]  Oh my gosh, we're so scared.
[02:37:12.709 --> 02:37:17.036]  You know, I don't want a real war, but that would shut all the leftists and the communists up real quick if it started.
[02:37:27.751 --> 02:37:28.151]  Here's the deal.
[02:37:28.211 --> 02:37:29.092]  I didn't start the war.
[02:37:29.472 --> 02:37:31.733]  Radical Islam is allied with the globalists, there's no doubt.
[02:37:32.074 --> 02:37:33.314]  Disagree with me if you think I'm wrong.
[02:37:33.374 --> 02:37:38.978]  Patrick Christies of westmonster.com, investigative journalist, one of the youngest editors in the UK to ever run major newspapers.
[02:37:39.018 --> 02:37:40.679]  But we're already in this war.
[02:37:40.799 --> 02:37:42.620]  It's like Patrick Henry said, the Revolutionary War.
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:45.441]  He goes, I'm not looking for a war, but it's already started.
[02:37:45.701 --> 02:37:50.682]  You can crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you, but as for me, liberty or death, I mean, we're already in this.
[02:37:50.722 --> 02:37:58.564]  We've already got the European government saying we're invading you with Islam, we're threatening your 15-year-old, 13-year-old daughters to have sex with Islamists.
[02:37:58.824 --> 02:38:02.985]  It's on children's TV that girls should have sex with Muslims.
[02:38:03.365 --> 02:38:04.946]  I mean, this is a clear takeover.
[02:38:05.106 --> 02:38:05.426]  Go ahead.
[02:38:07.188 --> 02:38:20.234]  Well, I mean, I think there are certain countries out there, Iran being one of them, of course, whereby, you know, they are very, very clear about the kind of society that they would like, and they would like to have a global Islamist society, and that is what they are open about.
[02:38:20.294 --> 02:38:26.137]  But, you know, I think crucially the point here regarding the Trump thing is, you know, they've burnt the American flag in their parliament over there,
[02:38:26.457 --> 02:38:28.398]  They've been making direct threats against the troops.
[02:38:28.438 --> 02:38:30.078]  What do people want their president to do?
[02:38:30.098 --> 02:38:32.339]  Do they want him to sit back and say nothing about it?
[02:38:32.619 --> 02:38:35.319]  A lot was made in the British press over here about Trump's reaction.
[02:38:35.359 --> 02:38:37.700]  Oh, he responded all in capitals on Twitter, you know.
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:41.961]  And that to us is very alien that we have a politician getting irate about something like that.
[02:38:42.101 --> 02:38:43.982]  I think that's perfectly, perfectly natural.
[02:38:44.282 --> 02:38:46.623]  And the fact is we are having a big debate in Britain at the minute.
[02:38:46.663 --> 02:38:47.943]  Today I wrote an article.
[02:38:48.523 --> 02:38:52.107]  About these two British citizens that went over to fight for ISIS abroad.
[02:38:52.407 --> 02:38:59.114]  Now, they've been captured over there, and there's a big hoo-ha because we're saying we want to send them over to America to face the death penalty, because you guys have the death penalty.
[02:38:59.514 --> 02:38:59.795]  Okay?
[02:39:00.095 --> 02:39:02.037]  And people are saying, no, it's against their human rights.
[02:39:02.057 --> 02:39:02.657]  Well, I'm sorry.
[02:39:02.718 --> 02:39:11.967]  I personally believe that these people forfeit their human rights when they go abroad, or join people who stay at home in England and across Europe, to stay at home and join these
[02:39:12.407 --> 02:39:12.868]  I agree.
[02:39:12.888 --> 02:39:14.690]  So why is the left so in love
[02:39:31.301 --> 02:39:35.605]  I'm asking this question... I think because they're weak and pathetic, Alex.
[02:39:35.625 --> 02:39:37.747]  You know, I don't understand, I can't understand what it is.
[02:39:37.787 --> 02:39:40.549]  And the fact is as well, I think they're not on the front line, a lot of these people.
[02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:45.874]  A lot of them live very sheltered lives, a lot of them live very gilded lives, especially people in the EU elite.
[02:39:45.914 --> 02:39:49.297]  They never live in any of the areas that are targeted by these things.
[02:39:49.317 --> 02:39:51.359]  They never live in any of the areas that face the brunt
[02:39:52.279 --> 02:39:52.700]  That's right.
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:56.221]  In fact, Paul Watson's done some demographic studies showing Google Maps that the most leftist areas of London are 99% white.
[02:40:17.116 --> 02:40:20.482]  And then there are people that are different colors, it's just different cultures.
[02:40:21.003 --> 02:40:23.126]  Third world, you know, really collapsed countries.
[02:40:23.507 --> 02:40:26.953]  And then like, they're the ones that do not want to be around any of this.
[02:40:28.035 --> 02:40:28.736]  It's crazy.
[02:40:30.473 --> 02:40:30.893]  It's crazy.
[02:40:30.913 --> 02:40:37.696]  For me, it's just, look, it's got absolutely nothing to do with, you know, I've got friends of all different races, demographics, whatever, colours, creeds, whatever you want to say.
[02:40:37.756 --> 02:40:38.756]  It's got nothing to do with that.
[02:40:38.796 --> 02:40:44.598]  The fact is, there is, unfortunately, elements of Islam at the minute that are extremely radical, OK?
[02:40:44.658 --> 02:40:45.979]  And they make no bones about that.
[02:40:45.999 --> 02:40:48.439]  Well, that's the thing, is these countries are collapsing.
[02:40:48.459 --> 02:40:49.700]  They're under radical Islam.
[02:40:50.180 --> 02:40:51.702]  And then they're bringing all these people in.
[02:40:51.842 --> 02:40:54.426]  What is Europe's... I agree with you though.
[02:40:54.586 --> 02:40:55.907]  They're not going to be able to control this.
[02:40:55.927 --> 02:41:00.493]  Like they dreamed of bringing in and making everybody integrate and creating a new guilt culture.
[02:41:00.513 --> 02:41:01.074]  It's not going to work.
[02:41:02.594 --> 02:41:09.058]  But they're not trying, and they're not trying in this sense, by when you don't bother to patrol the borders, you have no idea who is coming in and who is coming out.
[02:41:09.078 --> 02:41:16.482]  Some of the Paris attackers, the terrible Bataclan attack in Paris, you'll remember, some of those people came in hiding among genuine refugees.
[02:41:16.763 --> 02:41:25.888]  And the fact is, as long as the European Union and the other powers that be aren't bothering to check who these people are, who all of these people are coming in, they are opening up the situation.
[02:41:25.908 --> 02:41:27.049]  They're liable for allowing it to come in.
[02:41:27.709 --> 02:41:33.193]  But clearly... I would say they should face charges for some of the things that have gone on, because ultimately it is their fault.
[02:41:33.954 --> 02:41:34.394]  You're right.
[02:41:34.454 --> 02:41:40.039]  Let me ask Patrick Christie, when we come back from westmonster.com, where he thinks it all ends.
[02:41:40.139 --> 02:41:53.149]  And then, ladies and gentlemen, coming up, hosting the next hour of the broadcast, we have a special guest, Lionel, joining us on this live Monday edition.
[02:41:54.505 --> 02:41:58.227]  Please don't forget before I end this segment that without you, we're not going to be here.
[02:41:59.507 --> 02:42:00.928]  Without me plugging, we're not going to be here.
[02:42:01.008 --> 02:42:01.748]  I'm our biggest problem.
[02:42:02.589 --> 02:42:04.990]  I need to plug like every segment instead of like once an hour.
[02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:06.811]  But look, it doesn't matter.
[02:42:07.971 --> 02:42:15.675]  We have supplements that are the very best out there where we don't mark stuff up seven times, we mark it up 150 times and then we discount it.
[02:42:15.715 --> 02:42:16.175]  You get it for
[02:42:17.478 --> 02:42:19.719]  Like 20-30% above what it costs us.
[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:24.282]  I mean, some of these specials we're running right now are actually lost leaders, but I want you to see how great X2 is.
[02:42:24.703 --> 02:42:28.785]  Alpha Power, Brain Force Plus, the Real Red Pill Plus, Knockout.
[02:42:29.446 --> 02:42:32.627]  Knockout's totally organic, by the way, so sometimes it's stronger, sometimes it's weaker.
[02:42:32.668 --> 02:42:36.030]  We had a batch six months ago so strong, I couldn't even take a pill.
[02:42:36.410 --> 02:42:37.390]  Now I've got to take two of them.
[02:42:37.450 --> 02:42:39.572]  This latest batch is kind of weak, a new batch is coming in.
[02:42:39.992 --> 02:42:41.294]  The point is, it's all excellent.
[02:42:41.734 --> 02:42:46.861]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:42:47.241 --> 02:42:50.866]  Take advantage of up to 67% off storewide and free shipping.
[02:42:50.906 --> 02:42:52.308]  But it's all got to end today.
[02:42:52.708 --> 02:42:53.669]  New specials tomorrow.
[02:42:53.709 --> 02:42:54.671]  These are big specials.
[02:42:55.031 --> 02:42:55.632]  Biggest ever.
[02:42:55.672 --> 02:42:56.413]  Take advantage of them.
[02:42:59.474 --> 02:43:01.517]  The deep state is making its move.
[02:43:02.158 --> 02:43:09.807]  Multiple members of Congress, the FBI, the CIA, are all on television saying, we need the military to remove the president.
[02:43:10.648 --> 02:43:15.795]  We need a coup in this country, bare minimum, 25th Amendment, to remove him from office.
[02:43:15.835 --> 02:43:16.176]  And why?
[02:43:16.636 --> 02:43:29.751]  Because he went and had a summit, a year and a half plus into office, that he should have had a month into office, with Vladimir Putin, and met with him privately, just like he did with Theresa May, and dozens of other world leaders, like the communist Chinese dictator.
[02:43:30.031 --> 02:43:33.074]  Think about that, calling it treason, calling it traitorous.
[02:43:34.016 --> 02:43:41.801]  That Trump was nice to Putin in his language, when in truth, Trump has been crushing Russia with expanded U.S.
[02:43:41.881 --> 02:43:46.704]  energy sales, by shipping missiles into Ukraine to fight the Russians, with all these sanctions.
[02:43:46.824 --> 02:43:47.604]  It's incredible.
[02:43:47.965 --> 02:43:49.185]  But here's the big takeaway.
[02:43:49.866 --> 02:43:52.167]  Hiding in plain view that they hope you don't pay attention to.
[02:43:52.467 --> 02:43:54.689]  The Democrats are the party of globalism.
[02:43:55.874 --> 02:44:07.470]  Along with the blue-blood Republicans like George Herbert Walker Bush and his New World Order speech, globalism is about taking national sovereignty away and transferring it to the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN.
[02:44:08.271 --> 02:44:09.492]  The EU is unelected.
[02:44:10.093 --> 02:44:12.456]  It's in a trade war with us with giant tariffs on us.
[02:44:13.197 --> 02:44:15.138]  Canada, China, they all have huge tariffs.
[02:44:15.178 --> 02:44:16.098]  We have nothing on them.
[02:44:16.559 --> 02:44:19.240]  Trump is 100% fighting for the country.
[02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:21.020]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[02:44:21.841 --> 02:44:22.821]  It's America first.
[02:44:23.161 --> 02:44:27.563]  Our military, our borders, our everything, that's what you do when you strengthen the nation.
[02:44:27.983 --> 02:44:29.964]  The globalists are about weakening the nation.
[02:44:30.445 --> 02:44:30.905]  Democrat,
[02:44:32.066 --> 02:44:37.390]  Appellate court, Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags in schools on the West Coast because it's a hate symbol.
[02:44:37.890 --> 02:44:39.011]  They hate flyover country.
[02:44:39.172 --> 02:44:40.132]  They hate bitter clingers.
[02:44:40.653 --> 02:44:42.074]  The universities hate America.
[02:44:42.214 --> 02:44:43.075]  They hate free speech.
[02:44:43.415 --> 02:44:45.257]  They're the party of globalism.
[02:44:45.577 --> 02:44:47.418]  They're the party of the New World Order.
[02:44:47.659 --> 02:44:53.744]  They're the party of destroying America's sovereignty, breaking our families up, demoralizing us, creating racial strife.
[02:44:53.964 --> 02:44:54.905]  It's all in the WikiLeaks!
[02:44:55.245 --> 02:44:56.526]  They're the ones of fake news.
[02:44:56.586 --> 02:44:57.927]  They're the ones that rig the debates.
[02:44:57.987 --> 02:45:01.350]  They're the ones that steal billions of dollars and launder money with their foundations.
[02:45:01.390 --> 02:45:07.574]  They're the ones caught in child sex trafficking with Jeffrey Epstein and Lolita Express and all the rest of it.
[02:45:07.954 --> 02:45:08.635]  They're the enemy.
[02:45:09.375 --> 02:45:22.325]  And then they turn around and point their finger at Trump, who's clearly America first, classic Americana, and the country coming back from the dead, and say because he met with the second biggest nuclear arms country in the world, he better be
[02:45:23.185 --> 02:45:25.087]  That he's a traitor?
[02:45:25.547 --> 02:45:27.548]  And that the military needs to remove him?
[02:45:28.209 --> 02:45:30.410]  That sounds like something out of the old Soviet Union!
[02:45:31.311 --> 02:45:34.093]  Just like the left's calling for me to be banned and taken off the air.
[02:45:34.473 --> 02:45:35.513]  They openly admit it.
[02:45:35.954 --> 02:45:37.375]  They are the clear and present danger.
[02:45:37.755 --> 02:45:38.555]  They're the globalists.
[02:45:38.616 --> 02:45:39.436]  They're the deep state.
[02:45:39.696 --> 02:45:44.699]  And now this hype even has some conservatives going, well, I guess he should have been tougher on Putin.
[02:45:44.980 --> 02:45:46.401]  Yeah, we're a nation.
[02:45:46.661 --> 02:45:47.681]  We're sovereign.
[02:45:47.922 --> 02:45:49.323]  We're being taken over by Russia.
[02:45:50.163 --> 02:45:51.604]  Russia has the same enemy as us.
[02:45:52.524 --> 02:45:53.164]  George Soros.
[02:45:53.184 --> 02:46:01.988]  A lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion, but does that make him, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[02:46:02.328 --> 02:46:05.670]  It's the multinationals working with the shycoms trying to overthrow the US.
[02:46:06.190 --> 02:46:09.051]  It's Hollywood owned by the shycoms trying to overthrow the US.
[02:46:09.391 --> 02:46:10.812]  Not the Russians and not Trump.
[02:46:11.172 --> 02:46:13.333]  If the Russians were doing any of this, I'd be their enemy.
[02:46:13.693 --> 02:46:14.293]  But they're not.
[02:46:14.714 --> 02:46:17.255]  They're trying to stabilize themselves just like we are.
[02:46:18.115 --> 02:46:20.757]  Every sovereign nation in the world is under globalist attack.
[02:46:21.418 --> 02:46:27.662]  Infowars is on the front lines fighting against that and promoting true open free societies and free market capitalism.
[02:46:27.882 --> 02:46:28.703]  And so is Trump.
[02:46:29.003 --> 02:46:32.946]  And I stand with him against all the bullies and all the followers and all the cowards.
[02:46:33.166 --> 02:46:36.469]  And I know we're going to continue to win thanks to all of you in the Infowars.
[02:46:36.669 --> 02:46:40.332]  But make no mistake, they're making their move and they are the enemy.
[02:46:40.652 --> 02:46:42.574]  They are the threat to this nation.
[02:46:43.674 --> 02:46:46.956]  It's sovereignty, and our people's safety and prosperity.
[02:46:47.476 --> 02:46:50.578]  I'm Alex Jones, reporting for duty in the battle for the Republic.
[02:46:51.098 --> 02:46:51.998]  The year is 2018.
[02:46:52.859 --> 02:46:53.719]  History's happening now.
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:55.700]  Choose which side you're on.
[02:47:02.824 --> 02:47:05.485]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:22.265 --> 02:47:23.546]  Alright, we've got a few minutes left.
[02:47:37.699 --> 02:47:42.683]  And then Lionel, investigative journalist, former prosecutor, is coming on to break down all the latest developments that are unfolding.
[02:47:43.023 --> 02:47:45.024]  Hillary caught meeting secretly with Putin.
[02:47:45.865 --> 02:47:47.546]  Just incredible stuff coming up with him.
[02:47:48.147 --> 02:47:51.589]  Finishing with Patrick Christies of westmonster.com.
[02:47:52.450 --> 02:47:55.132]  Again, he's been a big investigative journalist, a major newspaper editor.
[02:47:55.152 --> 02:47:56.933]  Now they cut up an independent site.
[02:47:57.633 --> 02:47:58.794]  Just two final questions.
[02:48:00.035 --> 02:48:05.039]  We see a lot of persecution of people talking about globalism, the Islamic invasion.
[02:48:05.099 --> 02:48:09.943]  What have you gone through on that point for being out there traveling in North Africa, the Middle East, covering it?
[02:48:09.963 --> 02:48:17.008]  And then, what about Brexit, where Theresa May is now saying we may not even have a debate about it, we may just kill it?
[02:48:17.528 --> 02:48:19.770]  Some people are saying it will cause civil insurrection.
[02:48:20.891 --> 02:48:23.113]  What would you say the state of the euro is?
[02:48:24.918 --> 02:48:29.182]  Yeah, well, the state of the Euro is poor, but there's a very reassuring element to this, Alex.
[02:48:29.482 --> 02:48:38.630]  If you look at the latest elections in Germany, Italy, in the Czech Republic, for example, in Hungary as well, there's an independence movement in Catalonia, in Spain.
[02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:40.872]  The people are saying, look, enough's enough.
[02:48:41.212 --> 02:48:46.857]  And, for example, in Italy, now you're seeing, well, across all those countries I've just said, anti-establishment.
[02:48:47.237 --> 02:48:49.780]  New anti-elite parties.
[02:48:49.820 --> 02:48:53.184]  A lot of them are anti-euro, so anti-the single currency, bear in mind.
[02:48:53.564 --> 02:48:57.088]  These parties are now winning or coming up to hold the balance of power.
[02:48:57.148 --> 02:48:59.931]  Sweden as well is another one where they really are surging.
[02:48:59.951 --> 02:49:02.374]  And that is the out-and-out public rejection.
[02:49:02.974 --> 02:49:03.955]  Of course, we're good to go.
[02:49:23.607 --> 02:49:24.528]  Some of the things that I've done.
[02:49:24.888 --> 02:49:33.215]  I've put stories out there in the past just based on complete and utter facts with regards to migration figures or with regards to things I've seen over there in Turkey, Syria, etc.
[02:49:33.455 --> 02:49:35.356]  And people just tend to just accuse you of lying.
[02:49:35.676 --> 02:49:41.401]  They say you're lying, they tell you you're a racist, there's nothing that you, you know, there's nothing that you could say or do as soon as you bring up the topic.
[02:49:41.961 --> 02:49:47.686]  Of immigration or having any kind of control on it whatsoever, even a skills-based immigration system.
[02:49:48.026 --> 02:50:02.597]  You tend to get hounded by either people in the mainstream media or just a lot of the members of the general public because that is what, in a way, they're conditioned to feel now and think now that anyone who doesn't want anything on the complete... Well, it's not to say, if you ask a Democrat, they go, I want no borders at all.
[02:50:02.637 --> 02:50:04.078]  But I go, well, Mexico has them.
[02:50:04.518 --> 02:50:05.939]  I mean, you have to have them.
[02:50:05.959 --> 02:50:07.761]  They're like, no, nothing, nothing.
[02:50:07.841 --> 02:50:09.102]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:50:10.703 --> 02:50:11.343]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:11.363 --> 02:50:14.024]  I mean, look, if you don't have any borders, then why have any countries, you know?
[02:50:14.285 --> 02:50:15.305]  And people want countries.
[02:50:15.565 --> 02:50:16.686]  The World Cup was just on.
[02:50:16.786 --> 02:50:18.726]  Everyone was supporting their own country, weren't they?
[02:50:18.827 --> 02:50:19.047]  Right.
[02:50:19.347 --> 02:50:21.628]  Why don't we support our own countries on the day-to-day basis?
[02:50:21.668 --> 02:50:23.709]  And you know, in England, how bad it's got, Alex?
[02:50:24.029 --> 02:50:30.572]  During the World Cup, people were banned from flying the flag of Britain, of England, sorry, the St.
[02:50:30.592 --> 02:50:34.093]  George's flag, because they thought it might stir up racial tensions.
[02:50:34.193 --> 02:50:36.194]  I mean, come on, what is the world coming to, really?
[02:50:38.582 --> 02:50:41.571]  No one would even think that, but the media says it to create that idea.
[02:50:42.850 --> 02:50:43.850]  Yeah, exactly, this is it.
[02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:49.932]  And they're going, they're going, oh no, look, the worst thing that can happen in England is if we win the World Cup because it might stir up the far-right tensions.
[02:50:49.952 --> 02:50:50.832]  You know what would happen?
[02:50:51.152 --> 02:50:58.494]  Is that for about two days, everyone in the country would go out onto the streets, drink some beers, wave some flags, hug each other, and you'd all go back to work.
[02:50:58.774 --> 02:50:59.594]  That is it.
[02:50:59.874 --> 02:51:00.114]  Right?
[02:51:00.134 --> 02:51:02.075]  There's no violence, there'd be no racism.
[02:51:02.115 --> 02:51:11.597]  But I've even seen the EU a decade ago, and then a few years ago, they said, we want to get rid of nationalist connotations to national teams, and have them have these generic names.
[02:51:13.038 --> 02:51:14.741]  Yeah, because they want the breakdown of it.
[02:51:14.801 --> 02:51:16.403]  You know why ultimately they want the breakdown?
[02:51:16.443 --> 02:51:23.775]  Because the European Union is controlled by about 20 or so people, apart from the George Soros's of this world, of course, who are right at the top.
[02:51:23.795 --> 02:51:28.262]  20 or so unelected officials that are right at the top of this EU pyramid.
[02:51:28.582 --> 02:51:30.343]  Now, they are unelected, unaccountable.
[02:51:30.363 --> 02:51:31.744]  They have meetings behind closed doors.
[02:51:31.764 --> 02:51:35.425]  They don't even want to have their expenses claimed, their finances looked into.
[02:51:35.805 --> 02:51:44.870]  If you break down all of the nations, people have no idea who's making their decisions for them, the process that goes into it, and the reasons why these decisions are taking place.
[02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:47.711]  They have no idea who's in control, and that's what they want.
[02:51:47.771 --> 02:51:53.614]  As long as you've got distinct, powerful, individual countries, that can't happen, and that's why they're trying to break it down.
[02:51:53.874 --> 02:52:00.060]  That's right, they want a bunch of just followers that follow corporate propaganda that have no identity so they can come in and enslave you.
[02:52:00.100 --> 02:52:06.766]  So at a gut level, you've traveled all over the world, you've covered this for major newspapers, where do you think it ends?
[02:52:08.187 --> 02:52:09.308]  How do you think it's going for me?
[02:52:09.348 --> 02:52:13.752]  You say badly for the EU, badly for... but they're going to try to come back, Patrick Christie's.
[02:52:14.232 --> 02:52:16.014]  So at a gut level, where do you think this is going?
[02:52:17.392 --> 02:52:19.173]  Yeah, look man, it's going to be one of two things.
[02:52:19.293 --> 02:52:30.097]  It's either going to end in kind of the end of a lot of European societies as we know it, and a lot of Western societies as we know it, because if we don't get a grip of this, culture and everything is going to become completely diluted.
[02:52:30.497 --> 02:52:33.438]  Realistically, Alex, I do honestly have faith in the people.
[02:52:33.518 --> 02:52:34.619]  I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
[02:52:34.879 --> 02:52:37.620]  And we are seeing it in elections right across the country.
[02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:39.381]  I'm sorry, right across the country.
[02:52:39.421 --> 02:52:39.921]  No, I agree.
[02:52:39.961 --> 02:52:44.543]  So everywhere nationalist populists are winning, liberal conservative coalitions... Yeah, it's going to get more and more.
[02:52:44.563 --> 02:52:46.844]  Liberal conservative coalitions... Yeah, it's going to get more and more.
[02:52:47.783 --> 02:52:49.745]  So how does the EU strike back, though?
[02:52:51.326 --> 02:52:52.227]  Well, it's interesting.
[02:52:52.247 --> 02:52:53.448]  We'll have to wait and see.
[02:52:54.048 --> 02:53:01.094]  I think, personally, that they're a little bit too limp-wristed to be able to do anything without the mask slipping too much.
[02:53:01.374 --> 02:53:05.537]  I think that we caught them by surprise, a lot of these Conservative coalitions, as you've said.
[02:53:05.917 --> 02:53:06.338]  And actually,
[02:53:06.838 --> 02:53:16.666]  If we hadn't done, and if we hadn't gone and mobilised en masse in the way that Brexit and a load of different people have done across the continent very quickly, in the space of a couple of years, they would have been able to stop it.
[02:53:16.986 --> 02:53:19.028]  I don't think they can stop it now.
[02:53:19.328 --> 02:53:21.670]  I mean, it's going to take something monumental for them to do it.
[02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:23.451]  And, you know, look, I haven't got a crystal ball.
[02:53:23.491 --> 02:53:24.412]  I can't predict what that is.
[02:53:24.452 --> 02:53:28.035]  But I really, really do think that the people have outmanoeuvred them here.
[02:53:28.395 --> 02:53:32.778]  And these Liberals are too weak and a bit too slow-moving to catch it.
[02:53:32.859 --> 02:53:35.781]  And I don't think they're going to stand a chance against people like us in Macquarie.
[02:53:36.195 --> 02:53:36.675]  That's right.
[02:53:36.735 --> 02:53:39.956]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[02:53:39.996 --> 02:53:41.597]  And I think that's happening here.
[02:53:41.617 --> 02:53:44.337]  I just don't want us to have that view and not stay vigilant.
[02:53:44.998 --> 02:53:47.918]  Patrick Christie, thank you so much from westmonster.com.
[02:53:49.759 --> 02:53:50.579]  All right, there he goes.
[02:53:50.939 --> 02:53:53.320]  We're going to have Lionel take over here in just a few minutes.
[02:53:54.602 --> 02:53:55.602]  I covered most of the news.
[02:53:56.303 --> 02:53:57.843]  I didn't do a good enough job on this, though.
[02:53:57.903 --> 02:53:59.523]  Paul Watson came up with a petition.
[02:54:00.084 --> 02:54:01.504]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:54:02.484 --> 02:54:06.185]  A huge new petition launched to end shadow banning on social media censorship.
[02:54:06.665 --> 02:54:08.626]  And the point is, Congress is ready to hear this.
[02:54:08.666 --> 02:54:09.406]  They're having hearings.
[02:54:09.746 --> 02:54:10.646]  The President's ready.
[02:54:11.067 --> 02:54:13.947]  They are totally banning people that expose pedophilia.
[02:54:13.967 --> 02:54:15.948]  I mean, you get people fired for pedophilia.
[02:54:17.233 --> 02:54:23.857]  Promotion and and you're still bad and they shadow ban you so these are fights We want to wade into like oh, they'll fight us.
[02:54:24.057 --> 02:54:24.898]  We're here for the fight.
[02:54:25.478 --> 02:54:29.601]  Yeah, I get it They're gonna come after you know I they already did I I get it
[02:54:30.964 --> 02:54:32.205]  Well, you're going to have a fight on your hands.
[02:54:32.766 --> 02:54:39.953]  I'm not trying to just sit on the sidelines my whole life and, you know, just eat juicy steaks and screw around.
[02:54:40.113 --> 02:54:43.716]  You know, I want to eat juicy steaks, but I want to be victorious.
[02:54:43.756 --> 02:54:44.437]  I want to be free.
[02:54:44.477 --> 02:54:45.718]  I want to build a future.
[02:54:46.779 --> 02:54:49.842]  And so all these men sit on the sidelines, God, most men I know,
[02:54:50.774 --> 02:54:54.937]  are just absolutely go-along, get-along candy ashes.
[02:54:55.517 --> 02:55:00.560]  But there is a cadre of men of every race, color, and creed who are the human race that want freedom and a future.
[02:55:01.041 --> 02:55:03.182]  And they're the people I salute and want to thank and appreciate.
[02:55:04.770 --> 02:55:07.392]  But go sign the petition at Change.org.
[02:55:08.493 --> 02:55:09.614]  And it's our petition.
[02:55:09.714 --> 02:55:11.635]  Just to point this out, we're doing another petition as well.
[02:55:12.035 --> 02:55:13.316]  And this stuff has a big effect.
[02:55:14.157 --> 02:55:17.139]  Demand that social media companies censorship alternative voices.
[02:55:17.659 --> 02:55:18.600]  Change.org.
[02:55:19.081 --> 02:55:21.622]  And Paul Watson links to it in the article on Infowars.com.
[02:55:23.294 --> 02:55:26.396]  And it goes through how you're being shadowbanned, how you're being censored.
[02:55:26.416 --> 02:55:32.119]  We're really just raising awareness of this for the racketeering and antitrust charges for Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[02:55:32.159 --> 02:55:34.160]  So enjoy yourselves.
[02:55:34.581 --> 02:55:38.723]  If Zuckerberg thinks that little game of, oh Alex Jones, you know, he's just wrong.
[02:55:39.123 --> 02:55:39.984]  We don't want to ban him.
[02:55:40.004 --> 02:55:40.744]  You already banned me.
[02:55:41.565 --> 02:55:41.925]  Shadowban.
[02:55:42.605 --> 02:55:44.186]  So don't play the game, oh you didn't ban me.
[02:55:44.206 --> 02:55:45.667]  I go, oh I'm not banned.
[02:55:45.687 --> 02:55:46.948]  These aren't the droids I'm looking for.
[02:55:47.328 --> 02:55:47.888]  Move along.
[02:55:48.208 --> 02:55:48.749]  I'm already banned.
[02:55:49.468 --> 02:55:52.349]  And then you go, oh, you know, Holocaust deniers are just wrong.
[02:55:52.369 --> 02:55:53.190]  They're not bad people.
[02:55:53.550 --> 02:55:54.410]  No, they're bad people.
[02:55:55.691 --> 02:55:56.571]  Hitler didn't like Jews.
[02:55:56.591 --> 02:55:58.192]  He killed a bunch of them.
[02:55:58.212 --> 02:55:59.293]  They got the right to say it.
[02:55:59.313 --> 02:56:01.134]  Just don't say, oh, they're just misguided.
[02:56:02.794 --> 02:56:11.678]  And then, sure as hell, don't say that I'm now a Holocaust denier in your backhanded, oh, Alex, you're a Holocaust denier, but you still have a right to speak.
[02:56:11.999 --> 02:56:13.159]  Oh, thank you, Zuckerberg.
[02:56:13.459 --> 02:56:14.580]  You think I'm stupid, man?
[02:56:16.596 --> 02:56:18.678]  Think I'm a chump just because you had something pump and dump?
[02:56:18.998 --> 02:56:19.919]  Made a hundred billion dollars?
[02:56:20.139 --> 02:56:20.639]  Jerk off?
[02:56:23.822 --> 02:56:26.544]  The New York Times goes, Jones claims Soros is anti-Jew.
[02:56:26.564 --> 02:56:27.585]  He wants to overthrow Israel?
[02:56:27.865 --> 02:56:29.287]  Help round Jews up in World War II?
[02:56:29.527 --> 02:56:30.247]  Go read the article.
[02:56:31.528 --> 02:56:33.790]  All I do is tell the truth from what they say.
[02:56:33.810 --> 02:56:36.272]  It's unbelievable.
[02:56:37.133 --> 02:56:39.315]  Listen, our big sale ends today.
[02:56:39.355 --> 02:56:39.955]  It's got to end.
[02:56:39.975 --> 02:56:44.920]  Because a bunch of the stuff like X2 is close to selling out, even though we've been low on supply.
[02:56:46.112 --> 02:56:52.776]  It may be the end of X2, I can just tell everybody that right now, because we already got another Deep Earth Crystal source, but it's from a whole other strata.
[02:56:52.816 --> 02:56:53.957]  Maybe better, maybe worse.
[02:56:53.997 --> 02:56:54.377]  We're not sure.
[02:56:54.397 --> 02:56:55.258]  We're doing testing right now.
[02:56:55.718 --> 02:56:57.219]  We're on our last run of X2 right now.
[02:56:57.239 --> 02:57:00.201]  We got a good supply of it, but it's going to be gone soon.
[02:57:00.221 --> 02:57:03.263]  DNA Force Plus, we got a better deal on that.
[02:57:03.303 --> 02:57:03.903]  We lowered the price.
[02:57:03.963 --> 02:57:04.424]  It's amazing.
[02:57:05.805 --> 02:57:07.327]  BrainForce Plus is amazing.
[02:57:07.427 --> 02:57:08.348]  MFullRestore.com.
[02:57:09.209 --> 02:57:10.431]  50 to 67% off.
[02:57:10.831 --> 02:57:11.632]  The discounts start at $50.
[02:57:11.852 --> 02:57:13.634]  They go to 67% off and free shipping.
[02:57:13.955 --> 02:57:14.656]  That's got to end.
[02:57:14.676 --> 02:57:18.460]  In fact, when I get off the air today, I'm going to go do some new specials and stuff and launch those tomorrow.
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:21.023]  MFullRestore.com, MFullRestoreLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:23.886 --> 02:57:26.207]  I'll do five more minutes and then Lionel's going to come in.
[02:57:26.227 --> 02:57:28.547]  So we're going to start the next hour.
[02:57:28.567 --> 02:57:32.108]  Then I got a lot of things to do.
[02:57:32.168 --> 02:57:37.309]  As they say, the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I've got miles to go before I sleep.
[02:57:38.209 --> 02:57:41.470]  So I got to tell my little pony to get back on the road, even though that forest is beautiful.
[02:57:41.490 --> 02:57:42.570]  I'm going to stop her for the night.
[02:57:43.070 --> 02:57:45.170]  We have to go forward into Mordor, don't we?
[02:57:49.751 --> 02:57:50.411]  It's all happening.
[02:57:51.952 --> 02:57:53.032]  Trump is a nationalist.
[02:57:54.111 --> 02:57:55.045]  The country's coming back.
[02:57:56.735 --> 02:58:05.021]  The globalist forces in this country, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans, are openly saying they want to remove him for a military coup, or for the 25th Amendment.
[02:58:05.121 --> 02:58:06.061]  It's unbelievable.
[02:58:06.401 --> 02:58:07.422]  It's all happening right now.
[02:58:07.942 --> 02:58:17.409]  That's why it's more important than ever that every viewer, every listener, to local radio, to TV, or over the internet, understand, your voice isn't just critical, it's essential.
[02:58:18.069 --> 02:58:26.215]  If you don't stand up and speak out, and stand up against these bullies, and point out that it's the globalists that are the ones that sold out America, not Trump, and that they're the enemy,
[02:58:26.875 --> 02:58:27.515]  They're the traitors.
[02:58:28.276 --> 02:58:30.256]  They may be successful removing our president.
[02:58:30.597 --> 02:58:32.957]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:33.438 --> 02:58:38.300]  Trump is so real, he's so hardcore, and it's so unbelievable to see that we are at this point.
[02:58:38.580 --> 02:58:41.021]  We are in the middle of a second American Revolution.
[02:58:41.401 --> 02:58:44.082]  This time, not against King George III, but against the globalists.
[02:58:44.542 --> 02:58:48.644]  We're running a special for a week that is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[02:58:48.664 --> 02:58:51.266]  We just keep boosting the sales.

[02:59:29.611 --> 02:59:31.472]  We're coming through the storm thanks to you.
[02:59:31.872 --> 02:59:32.853]  Shop with the good guys.

[02:59:39.017 --> 02:59:40.458]  This is the battle for the future.
[02:59:40.798 --> 02:59:41.919]  This is the war for the future.
[02:59:42.279 --> 02:59:45.761]  And I need all of you to commit even more to this fight.
[02:59:46.102 --> 02:59:46.422]  Thank you.
[02:59:46.742 --> 02:59:48.063]  I'm counting on you, and I salute you.
[02:59:53.586 --> 03:00:00.609]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:06.752 --> 03:00:13.475]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[03:00:13.555 --> 03:00:15.796]  You better believe you've got one!
[03:00:17.964 --> 03:00:23.208]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:51.652]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[03:00:52.132 --> 03:01:04.836]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[03:01:06.696 --> 03:01:10.078]  Trans-dimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through full space.
[03:01:10.499 --> 03:01:14.621]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[03:01:14.841 --> 03:01:18.864]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[03:01:19.622 --> 03:01:26.165]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[03:01:26.405 --> 03:01:32.568]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[03:01:32.908 --> 03:01:34.529]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[03:01:34.949 --> 03:01:35.749]  It's fulfilling.
[03:01:35.929 --> 03:01:36.650]  InfoWars.
[03:01:37.030 --> 03:01:38.591]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:01:38.611 --> 03:01:44.373]  Alright, I covered a lot of news today, and Lionel's coming up, always power-packed.
[03:01:44.754 --> 03:01:47.795]  And then the war room with Owen Sawyer and Roger Stone, obviously.
[03:01:49.821 --> 03:01:54.262]  I think about all the news we've broken and that's why they want to shut us down and why they say we're fake news because we're real news.
[03:01:54.282 --> 03:02:00.505]  But look at this French news agency and Yahoo story that just tells you everything.
[03:02:03.165 --> 03:02:07.507]  Sensors jump into action as China's latest vaccine scandal ignites.
[03:02:10.068 --> 03:02:13.349]  And then if you actually read into what it's really doing, they've got a bunch of fake
[03:02:14.591 --> 03:02:17.153]  Vaccines going out for rabies, you name it.
[03:02:17.694 --> 03:02:19.355]  And there they just censor things.
[03:02:19.835 --> 03:02:26.521]  Here they have a vaccine damage fund of billions of dollars that since the mid-80s has been paying out for all the damages.
[03:02:27.021 --> 03:02:31.124]  And then you say, hey, vaccines are tainted.
[03:02:31.164 --> 03:02:31.885]  They've got problems.
[03:02:31.905 --> 03:02:34.747]  They go, shut up, conspiracy theorists!
[03:02:34.767 --> 03:02:35.688]  Nothing ever happened.
[03:02:36.048 --> 03:02:37.570]  They had the swine flu in the 70s.
[03:02:37.610 --> 03:02:39.051]  Killed tens of thousands of people.
[03:02:39.791 --> 03:02:40.352]  The vaccine.
[03:02:42.697 --> 03:02:47.819]  So I just point this out because you know what percentage of U.S.
[03:02:47.859 --> 03:02:49.240]  vaccines get made in China?
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:51.301]  The last time I saw was over 70%.
[03:02:51.441 --> 03:02:57.044]  Let's just round down.
[03:02:57.064 --> 03:03:07.368]  70% of the vaccines are made in China are enemy that owns Hollywood, hates America, and is engaged in all this garbage.
[03:03:08.709 --> 03:03:08.849]  So,
[03:03:10.359 --> 03:03:12.401]  That's how my brain works, like I said at the start of the show.
[03:03:12.421 --> 03:03:13.882]  Like, the L.A.
[03:03:13.902 --> 03:03:15.243]  Times is reporting it, you name it.
[03:03:15.804 --> 03:03:15.964]  L.A.
[03:03:16.004 --> 03:03:18.286]  authorities recorded privileged attorney client conversations.
[03:03:18.626 --> 03:03:20.328]  Physic attorney says it may be illegal.
[03:03:20.688 --> 03:03:22.229]  Thousands of cases may be overturned.
[03:03:24.791 --> 03:03:35.721]  They said they're recording Manafort in jail talking about his legal strategy and then they put in court filings against him about his strategy to have one case before the other.
[03:03:39.065 --> 03:03:45.911]  I mean, that's the thing, is like, once it's Mueller, everyone's so scared of Mueller, they'd let Mueller rape kids in front of people, which he did.
[03:03:45.931 --> 03:03:58.381]  I mean, Mueller covered up for a decade for Epstein, kidnapping kids, flying them on sex planes, some kids as young as seven years old, reportedly, with big perverts raping them, to frame people.
[03:03:58.481 --> 03:04:01.184]  I mean, Mueller is a monster, man.
[03:04:01.624 --> 03:04:02.405]  God, imagine
[03:04:04.059 --> 03:04:05.499]  He's even above the pedophiles, though.
[03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:07.460]  The word is, he doesn't have sex with the kids.
[03:04:07.500 --> 03:04:08.440]  He just controls it all.
[03:04:08.460 --> 03:04:10.901]  Can you imagine being a monster like that?
[03:04:11.281 --> 03:04:11.701]  God!
[03:04:12.381 --> 03:04:12.621]  God!
[03:04:12.841 --> 03:04:14.222]  People say, well, God, aren't you scared of him?
[03:04:15.942 --> 03:04:17.963]  I'm scared of not manning up.
[03:04:20.604 --> 03:04:26.465]  I'm constantly in fear that I'm not being a real man, and I'm not doing what it takes, and I'm not telling the truth.
[03:04:27.125 --> 03:04:28.686]  And so, call it whatever you want.
[03:04:29.673 --> 03:04:31.274]  I look at that guy, and he's a sack of crap.
[03:04:32.114 --> 03:04:34.456]  That's a demon I will take down, or I'll die trying.
[03:04:35.196 --> 03:04:35.616]  So that's it.
[03:04:35.636 --> 03:04:36.997]  It's gonna happen.
[03:04:37.557 --> 03:04:39.799]  We're gonna walk out in the square, politically.
[03:04:40.619 --> 03:04:43.420]  High noon, and he's gonna find out when he makes a move, man.
[03:04:43.921 --> 03:04:46.362]  Make the move first, and then it's gonna happen.
[03:04:47.062 --> 03:04:48.263]  It's not a joke.
[03:04:48.523 --> 03:04:49.124]  It's not a game.
[03:04:49.384 --> 03:04:50.084]  It's the real world.
[03:04:51.285 --> 03:04:51.425]  Mm!
[03:04:51.925 --> 03:04:52.385]  Politically.
[03:04:52.986 --> 03:04:55.387]  You're gonna get it, or I'm gonna die trying, bitch.
[03:04:55.767 --> 03:04:56.187]  Get ready.
[03:04:56.528 --> 03:04:57.388]  We're gonna bang heads.
[03:04:57.408 --> 03:04:58.849]  We're gonna bang heads.
[03:05:01.096 --> 03:05:06.161]  Anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[03:05:06.802 --> 03:05:11.967]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[03:05:12.328 --> 03:05:18.994]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines.
[03:05:19.715 --> 03:05:22.918]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[03:05:23.659 --> 03:05:27.342]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[03:05:27.883 --> 03:05:29.044]  And my only message is this.
[03:05:29.304 --> 03:05:32.367]  Everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[03:05:33.207 --> 03:05:40.714]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[03:05:41.234 --> 03:05:44.056]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[03:05:44.076 --> 03:05:44.937]  We already have the power.
[03:05:44.957 --> 03:05:50.141]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[03:05:50.963 --> 03:05:53.408]  InfoWars is on the front line, and so are you.
[03:05:53.689 --> 03:05:54.952]  We are the resistance!
[03:06:09.224 --> 03:06:10.864]  I love it!
[03:06:11.084 --> 03:06:11.965]  I love it!
[03:06:12.045 --> 03:06:14.045]  Can you hear me okay, Alex?
[03:06:14.185 --> 03:06:15.726]  How are you, buddy Lion?
[03:06:15.946 --> 03:06:18.726]  I can hear you loud and clear!
[03:06:18.746 --> 03:06:20.467]  You take over, my friend!
[03:06:36.994 --> 03:06:37.777]  Thank you, my friend.
[03:06:38.158 --> 03:06:40.988]  I've got three things I want to say today, so listen and listen good.
[03:06:41.108 --> 03:06:41.730]  Number one.
[03:06:42.725 --> 03:06:51.187]  I'm tired of hearing every little interstitial moment on Fox News or on CNN about every little movement.
[03:06:51.227 --> 03:07:06.892]  Hey, did you hear the word that Clapper knows something about Obama when he was such as a... Hey, did you hear the word that the FISA court, that we have the documents and that the Carter Page FISA warrants were based on the dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for?
[03:07:07.152 --> 03:07:08.492]  We know all this!
[03:07:09.153 --> 03:07:11.942]  Would somebody please just indict somebody?
[03:07:12.183 --> 03:07:13.467]  Exactly!
[03:07:13.608 --> 03:07:14.932]  We broke this years ago!
[03:07:16.591 --> 03:07:23.153]  Alex, I'm getting sick and tired of every day, finding every little, ooh, did you see this?
[03:07:23.493 --> 03:07:24.133]  Did you see this?
[03:07:24.173 --> 03:07:42.497]  Look, I don't know about you, but unless and until Hillary Clinton is charged with something, unless and until she is charged with anything, specifically, something involved with, let's say, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Clinton Health Access Initiative... She went and met with Putin repeatedly, she says in her own book, but says Trump should be arrested for doing it publicly.
[03:07:44.518 --> 03:07:45.358]  That's one thing.
[03:07:46.187 --> 03:07:52.449]  Second thing I've got to say is, I don't understand what President Trump is waiting for.
[03:07:53.129 --> 03:07:55.410]  Julian Assange is a hero.
[03:07:56.050 --> 03:07:57.490]  I don't care how you say it.
[03:07:57.550 --> 03:07:58.270]  No, I agree.
[03:07:58.310 --> 03:07:59.111]  Trump's got a party.
[03:07:59.131 --> 03:07:59.871]  Let me say this, though.
[03:08:00.131 --> 03:08:01.771]  What about Rand Paul calling for it this morning?
[03:08:01.791 --> 03:08:02.832]  Now, President exploring.
[03:08:03.092 --> 03:08:07.793]  He's meeting with Rand Paul right now, stripping Clapper, Obama, all these people.
[03:08:07.833 --> 03:08:08.613]  They're out of office.
[03:08:08.633 --> 03:08:09.954]  They still have access to everything.
[03:08:10.234 --> 03:08:12.094]  They still got their fingers in the pie here.
[03:08:12.514 --> 03:08:14.715]  He's looking to take it from Comey, Brennan, all of them.
[03:08:15.948 --> 03:08:25.277]  I cannot understand how anybody, you know Alex, when somebody normally is unceremoniously removed from their position, you say give us your door pass card, your parking space, and get the hell out of here!
[03:08:25.577 --> 03:08:39.610]  The idea, and I understand there's a certain degree of professional courtesy, but the big thing I want to say right now, the number one story, is for the longest time, people have looked at entertainment, Hollywood and the like, of being something almost
[03:08:41.351 --> 03:08:43.492]  You know, unnecessary but harmless.
[03:08:43.632 --> 03:08:44.792]  Oh, they make movies.
[03:08:44.912 --> 03:09:08.082]  Since the days of Frank Capra, all the way to when he became a propaganda agent during the war, very good though, to the time that Hollywood and war bonds were working together, from the time that the Intel CIA and OSS and others worked with the mob, there is this Gordian knot of people who were
[03:09:08.642 --> 03:09:29.879]  Seemingly unconnected, but who make the strangest bedfellows, and Hollywood, number one, is not only the money source, the feeder system, propaganda central, but it is now the tip of the, not tip of the spear, but the little scab of the purulent
[03:09:30.538 --> 03:09:34.619]  The fur uncle, the sebaceous purulent boil that's above the pump.
[03:09:34.679 --> 03:09:37.320]  It's the center of the disease trying to stop America's rebirth.
[03:09:37.380 --> 03:09:39.000]  It's been on the wrong side of history.
[03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:45.962]  It's getting its ass kicked so it gets more virulent in a petulant attempt to stop this, which is going to end up destroying it.
[03:09:47.062 --> 03:09:57.405]  Well, what's happening right now is when these seemingly strange tweets that now that I can't believe that Hollywood is this stupid to say
[03:09:58.200 --> 03:10:03.784]  That the James Gunn tweets are just about something that happened a long time ago.
[03:10:03.804 --> 03:10:13.270]  Meanwhile, following the Roseanne rule, the Roseanne rule says if you tweet something that somebody believes to be racist, that will make you a racist.
[03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:18.493]  Well, if you tweet something that involves you being a pedophile, aren't you a pedophile?
[03:10:18.833 --> 03:10:23.896]  And to think that others like Selma Blair and others are coming forward in the defense of him.
[03:10:24.957 --> 03:10:26.398]  And what's happening, there's three things.
[03:10:26.418 --> 03:10:27.139]  Let me ask you this, Alex.
[03:10:27.159 --> 03:10:31.342]  What would have happened if during the course of one of these tweet sessions, Mr. Gunn had used the dreaded N-word?
[03:10:51.184 --> 03:10:52.945]  Would that have negated their looking the other way?
[03:10:52.965 --> 03:10:54.125]  Oh, he would have been fired immediately.
[03:10:54.165 --> 03:10:56.966]  As long as you're talking about kidnapping and raping little girls, it's okay.
[03:10:57.006 --> 03:10:57.706]  Right.
[03:10:58.026 --> 03:10:58.807]  That's okay.
[03:10:58.867 --> 03:11:01.348]  That's that quirky kind of behavior that was a long time ago.
[03:11:01.568 --> 03:11:02.328]  Now, three things.
[03:11:02.368 --> 03:11:16.273]  Number one, and Alex, I can tell you this, being in here, being around these people, they live, and you know this too, they live in a world that says, let me tell you something, you hayseed, you rusticator, you corn pome, bib overall, redneck,
[03:11:17.195 --> 03:11:18.298]  You know what, Kicker?
[03:11:18.820 --> 03:11:19.822]  I'm Hollywood.
[03:11:20.123 --> 03:11:21.828]  You don't tell me what to do.
[03:11:22.149 --> 03:11:23.553]  This is our sense of humor.
[03:11:25.484 --> 03:11:30.388]  They think they're royalty, but this is our sensibilities and our worldview, and we don't want you talking to us about this.
[03:11:30.428 --> 03:11:36.833]  Number two, they have this thing, and it's been said, symbolism, symbology will be their downfall.
[03:11:36.954 --> 03:11:41.497]  And wherever they go, they want to share with a sense of imperviousness.
[03:11:41.517 --> 03:11:42.698]  They're impenetrable.
[03:11:43.039 --> 03:11:45.401]  This is our humor, like it or not.
[03:11:45.741 --> 03:11:50.425]  They also, number three, don't recognize the fact that this is permanently recorded.
[03:11:50.945 --> 03:11:56.674]  And they further don't understand, and I want people to understand this, and this may seem inconsistent...
[03:11:57.512 --> 03:12:10.958]  But please do not confuse somebody saying or joking about pedophile offenses with somebody being an actual convicted child rapist or the like.
[03:12:11.358 --> 03:12:17.421]  An idea as despicable as it is, is not the same.
[03:12:17.461 --> 03:12:20.382]  So you ask then, why are they so obsessed with promoting it?
[03:12:20.402 --> 03:12:24.484]  I think it's just a sense of nastiness, just to show how rebellious they are.
[03:12:25.749 --> 03:12:28.812]  Alex, you have no idea.
[03:12:28.972 --> 03:12:36.939]  We have been here in New York, and I've been doing comedy stuff and stand-up for years, and I don't know when it happened.
[03:12:37.479 --> 03:12:44.665]  But the humor quotient took a bad turn, where it became angry, and then- It's only about shock.
[03:12:44.766 --> 03:12:45.566]  It's only about shock.
[03:12:46.427 --> 03:12:47.368]  Precisely.
[03:12:47.688 --> 03:12:51.251]  And instead of being funny, it's do you have an attitude?
[03:12:51.611 --> 03:12:52.072]  And listen,
[03:12:53.762 --> 03:12:59.285]  You're a gentleman and a scholar, but I use scatological references.
[03:12:59.685 --> 03:13:05.207]  I tend to wax coprolalic every now and then, but it's never a substitution for wit.
[03:13:05.607 --> 03:13:13.470]  Now what you have is, you have these people, oh, and then you have Sarah Silverman, who's looking around saying, my career is in the crapper.
[03:13:13.870 --> 03:13:14.591]  I don't know what to do.
[03:13:14.951 --> 03:13:15.551]  Wait a minute.
[03:13:15.911 --> 03:13:24.334]  Maybe I could have my Kathy Griffin moment and to think of the thing that she is now pushing her way, threatening the world.
[03:13:24.374 --> 03:13:24.774]  Pedophilia!
[03:13:24.794 --> 03:13:27.034]  She says, support pedophilia if you have courage.
[03:13:28.435 --> 03:13:33.056]  Right, but she's daring to say, you folks don't understand.
[03:13:33.276 --> 03:13:38.858]  Yeah, we don't get how cruel it is to kidnap a kid out of their backyard and rape him to death for a week, then hang him up by piano wire.
[03:13:39.878 --> 03:13:42.539]  And they also don't understand, she thinks
[03:13:43.286 --> 03:13:48.270]  That we're just a bunch of folks with Twitter accounts, and that we are no match.
[03:13:48.290 --> 03:13:51.673]  You know, Alex, I have a friend of mine, and I'm going to say something that's so crude.
[03:13:51.973 --> 03:13:53.795]  Well, not really crude, but listen to the metaphor.
[03:13:54.075 --> 03:14:02.221]  I've got a friend of mine, he said, and he's an Italian feller, and he said, remember one thing, there's more of us than them.
[03:14:02.662 --> 03:14:07.866]  We can drown them in our urine, meaning that the enormity
[03:14:08.644 --> 03:14:13.766]  That if we decide to turn it off, if humanity got off the couch, these elites are gone.
[03:14:15.447 --> 03:14:16.627]  And, right, precisely.
[03:14:16.787 --> 03:14:20.029]  And they have been thinking for too long that they run this show.
[03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:23.350]  So right now, I just want to recap three things.
[03:14:24.031 --> 03:14:24.931]  Mr. President,
[03:14:26.474 --> 03:14:28.735]  I am so in support of you.
[03:14:28.935 --> 03:14:29.795]  I voted for me.
[03:14:30.195 --> 03:14:39.318]  I didn't know how you do at first, but I am magnificently impressed with how you have upset the apple cart and changed the deep state.
[03:14:39.698 --> 03:14:49.622]  But I am tired of having to hear the Judge Napolitano's or the Joe DeGeneva's and, you know, Sean Hannity.
[03:14:49.702 --> 03:14:50.462]  Bless your heart.
[03:14:50.582 --> 03:14:51.562]  Tell me every day.
[03:14:51.942 --> 03:14:53.403]  And here's what they're doing that's wrong.
[03:14:53.663 --> 03:14:54.143]  Damn it!
[03:14:54.363 --> 03:14:55.184]  Do something!
[03:14:55.444 --> 03:14:56.245]  Indict him!
[03:14:56.665 --> 03:14:57.506]  Grow a pair!
[03:14:57.886 --> 03:14:58.626]  A backbone!
[03:14:58.746 --> 03:14:59.787]  Wake Sessions up!
[03:15:23.884 --> 03:15:27.940]  If it's benign... And you read Google, they say they want to contain nationalism.
[03:15:28.181 --> 03:15:29.326]  It's all about containing-ish.
[03:15:30.669 --> 03:15:32.871]  Well, we want to break this thing apart.
[03:15:33.291 --> 03:15:36.873]  I want everybody to know what's going on, not just the select few.
[03:15:37.254 --> 03:15:38.715]  I've got a lot more, my friend.
[03:15:38.735 --> 03:15:40.556]  Well, tell us how we break out of the bubble.
[03:15:40.696 --> 03:15:45.700]  I just don't know how in what parallel universe we woke up and confirmed a bunch of pedophiles are running stuff.
[03:15:45.740 --> 03:15:46.921]  I'm like, what?
[03:15:46.961 --> 03:15:48.442]  You see how many gorgeous women there are?
[03:15:48.482 --> 03:15:49.803]  Like, who's attracted to kids?
[03:15:49.843 --> 03:15:51.464]  Well, that shows my blind spot.
[03:15:52.084 --> 03:15:53.746]  I just want to kill people that want to hurt kids.
[03:15:54.526 --> 03:15:55.207]  I'm not a sadist.
[03:15:55.247 --> 03:15:58.209]  I'm not a guy who wants to hurt people, but I want to kill pedophiles, I'll be honest.
[03:15:59.580 --> 03:16:01.622]  The deep state is making its move.
[03:16:02.283 --> 03:16:09.910]  Multiple members of Congress, the FBI, the CIA, are all on television saying, we need the military to remove the president.
[03:16:10.771 --> 03:16:15.895]  We need a coup in this country, bare minimum, 25th Amendment, to remove him from office.
[03:16:15.956 --> 03:16:16.296]  And why?
[03:16:16.756 --> 03:16:29.841]  Because he went and had a summit, a year and a half plus into office, that he should have had a month into office, with Vladimir Putin, and met with him privately, just like he did with Theresa May, and dozens of other world leaders, like the communist Chinese dictator.
[03:16:30.142 --> 03:16:33.163]  Think about that, calling it treason, calling it traitorous.
[03:16:34.116 --> 03:16:41.903]  That Trump was nice to Putin in his language, when in truth Trump has been crushing Russia with expanded U.S.
[03:16:41.983 --> 03:16:46.827]  energy sales, by shipping missiles into Ukraine to fight the Russians, with all these sanctions.
[03:16:46.947 --> 03:16:47.708]  It's incredible!
[03:16:48.088 --> 03:16:49.309]  But here's the big takeaway.
[03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:52.292]  Hiding in plain view that they hope you don't pay attention to.
[03:16:52.592 --> 03:16:54.794]  The Democrats are the party of globalism.
[03:16:55.990 --> 03:17:07.575]  Along with the blue-blood Republicans like George Herbert Walker Bush and his New World Order speech, globalism is about taking national sovereignty away and transferring it to the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN.
[03:17:08.375 --> 03:17:09.595]  The EU is unelected.
[03:17:10.196 --> 03:17:12.596]  It's in a trade war with us with giant tariffs on us.
[03:17:13.317 --> 03:17:15.257]  Canada, China, they all have huge tariffs.
[03:17:15.277 --> 03:17:16.218]  We have nothing on them.
[03:17:16.678 --> 03:17:19.359]  Trump is 100% fighting for the country.
[03:17:19.579 --> 03:17:21.100]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[03:17:21.940 --> 03:17:25.885]  It's America first, our military, our borders, our everything.
[03:17:25.965 --> 03:17:27.668]  That's what you do when you strengthen the nation.
[03:17:28.108 --> 03:17:30.071]  The globalists are about weakening the nation.
[03:17:30.571 --> 03:17:37.440]  Democrat appellate court, 9th Circuit, ruled you can't wear American flags in schools on the West Coast because it's a hate symbol.
[03:17:38.001 --> 03:17:39.122]  They hate flyover country.
[03:17:39.282 --> 03:17:40.243]  They hate bitter clingers.
[03:17:40.763 --> 03:17:42.184]  The universities hate America.
[03:17:42.324 --> 03:17:43.164]  They hate free speech.
[03:17:43.505 --> 03:17:45.366]  They're the party of globalism.
[03:17:45.666 --> 03:17:47.507]  They're the party of the New World Order.
[03:17:47.748 --> 03:17:53.852]  They're the party of destroying America's sovereignty, breaking our families up, demoralizing us, creating racial strife.
[03:17:54.072 --> 03:17:55.032]  It's all in the WikiLeaks.
[03:17:55.373 --> 03:17:56.633]  They're the ones of fake news.
[03:17:56.714 --> 03:17:58.014]  They're the ones that rig the debates.
[03:17:58.114 --> 03:18:01.477]  They're the ones that steal billions of dollars and launder money with their foundations.
[03:18:01.517 --> 03:18:07.681]  They're the ones caught in child sex trafficking with Jeffrey Epstein and Lolita Express and all the rest of it.
[03:18:08.061 --> 03:18:08.742]  They're the enemy.
[03:18:09.482 --> 03:18:27.675]  And then they turn around and point their finger at Trump, who's clearly America first, classic Americana, and the country coming back from the dead, and say because he met with the second biggest nuclear arms country in the world, he better be meeting with him and talking to him, that he's a traitor, and that the military needs to remove him?
[03:18:28.316 --> 03:18:30.478]  That sounds like something out of the old Soviet Union!
[03:18:31.418 --> 03:18:34.202]  Just like the left's calling for me to be banned and taken off the air.
[03:18:34.562 --> 03:18:35.624]  They openly admit it.
[03:18:36.064 --> 03:18:37.506]  They are the clear and present danger.
[03:18:37.867 --> 03:18:38.668]  They're the globalists.
[03:18:38.728 --> 03:18:39.529]  They're the deep state.
[03:18:39.809 --> 03:18:44.815]  And now this hype even has some conservatives going, well, I guess he should have been tougher on Putin.
[03:18:45.096 --> 03:18:46.517]  Yeah, we're a nation.
[03:18:46.778 --> 03:18:47.819]  We're sovereign.
[03:18:48.059 --> 03:18:49.441]  We're being taken over by Russia.
[03:18:50.282 --> 03:18:53.264]  Russia has the same enemy as us, George Soros.
[03:18:53.284 --> 03:19:02.109]  A lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion, but does it make him, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[03:19:02.449 --> 03:19:05.791]  It's the multinationals working with the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[03:19:06.291 --> 03:19:09.173]  It's Hollywood owned by the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[03:19:09.513 --> 03:19:10.934]  Not the Russians and not Trump.
[03:19:11.294 --> 03:19:13.455]  If the Russians were doing any of this, I'd be their enemy.
[03:19:13.816 --> 03:19:14.416]  But they're not.
[03:19:14.816 --> 03:19:17.358]  They're trying to stabilize themselves just like we are.
[03:19:18.218 --> 03:19:20.880]  Every sovereign nation in the world is under globalist attack.
[03:19:21.520 --> 03:19:27.784]  Infowars is on the front lines fighting against that and promoting true open free societies and free market capitalism.
[03:19:28.004 --> 03:19:28.804]  And so is Trump.
[03:19:29.125 --> 03:19:33.047]  And I stand with him against all the bullies and all the followers and all the cowards.
[03:19:33.287 --> 03:19:36.569]  And I know we're going to continue to win thanks to all of you in the Infowars.
[03:19:36.769 --> 03:19:40.451]  But make no mistake, they're making their move and they are the enemy.
[03:19:40.771 --> 03:19:42.693]  They are the threat to this nation.
[03:19:43.793 --> 03:19:47.077]  It's sovereignty and our people's safety and prosperity.
[03:19:47.577 --> 03:19:50.700]  I'm Alex Jones, reporting for duty in the battle for the Republic.
[03:19:51.221 --> 03:19:52.122]  The year is 2018.
[03:19:52.982 --> 03:19:53.843]  History's happening now.
[03:19:54.304 --> 03:19:55.825]  Choose which side you're on.
[03:20:03.252 --> 03:20:05.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:21.926 --> 03:20:28.268]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:33.149 --> 03:20:34.089]  Alrighty, Lionel, with you.
[03:20:34.249 --> 03:20:34.870]  Here I am.
[03:20:35.250 --> 03:20:36.030]  Proud to be here.
[03:20:36.190 --> 03:20:36.970]  Proud to be here.
[03:20:37.150 --> 03:20:38.050]  Got a couple of things to say.
[03:20:38.090 --> 03:20:45.772]  Don't have enough time, but I'm going to do my best to see if I can say it clearly and without... I hear a bit of an echo there, but maybe that's me.
[03:20:45.833 --> 03:20:47.473]  Maybe somebody can turn that thing down for me.
[03:20:47.553 --> 03:20:48.113]  Thank you.
[03:20:49.173 --> 03:20:51.054]  First of all, without further ado,
[03:20:52.344 --> 03:20:53.484]  I don't know why I'm hearing an echo.
[03:20:54.505 --> 03:20:55.305]  Is that me or what?
[03:20:56.725 --> 03:20:57.485]  I'm hearing an echo.
[03:20:58.845 --> 03:20:59.146]  OK.
[03:21:00.366 --> 03:21:06.447]  I am sick and tired of, as I said, hearing people every day on the various news.
[03:21:06.527 --> 03:21:08.988]  And by the way, God bless Fox News.
[03:21:10.188 --> 03:21:15.649]  If it wasn't for them, there would be nothing in what used to be the mainstream media, because this is now mainstream.
[03:21:15.809 --> 03:21:16.870]  But there is nobody out there.
[03:21:17.410 --> 03:21:18.510]  And Sean Hannity, I've known for 20,
[03:21:19.790 --> 03:21:25.032]  Five years and he's doing a great job up to a point.
[03:21:26.313 --> 03:21:28.314]  They go up to a point and they stop.
[03:21:28.854 --> 03:21:29.555]  I mean, they're great.
[03:21:29.595 --> 03:21:32.336]  Like, you know, they're going to fight the deep state.
[03:21:32.356 --> 03:21:34.637]  They kind of added that to their lexicon, which is great.
[03:21:34.837 --> 03:21:37.098]  You'll never hear anything about 9-11 or what?
[03:21:37.298 --> 03:21:40.460]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:21:40.760 --> 03:21:42.621]  They'll go a little bit if it's about Hillary Clinton.
[03:21:42.681 --> 03:21:43.541]  Yeah, we'll talk about that.
[03:21:43.581 --> 03:21:44.421]  But we never go beyond that.
[03:21:44.481 --> 03:21:45.222]  And you know what?
[03:21:45.402 --> 03:21:46.582]  I don't expect them to.
[03:21:47.043 --> 03:21:47.903]  But let's face it.
[03:21:48.934 --> 03:21:55.456]  It's all, it's still kind of a watered down, it's like, we'll give you the allowed version of this.
[03:21:56.017 --> 03:22:10.582]  And I love Judge Napolitano, God bless him, he's on there, Joe DiGenova, I mentioned a whole group of people, and Gowdy, and Goodlatte, but for the love of God, somebody hold somebody in contempt!
[03:22:11.242 --> 03:22:12.223]  Do something!
[03:22:12.803 --> 03:22:15.704]  Go in and fire everybody!
[03:22:16.744 --> 03:22:21.228]  Paula Richard Nixon, Saturday Night Massacre, whatever you want to call it.
[03:22:21.909 --> 03:22:23.450]  What are we doing?
[03:22:23.930 --> 03:22:28.094]  I'm tired of these, who did you see the latest one right now?
[03:22:28.134 --> 03:22:34.480]  We got a new, oh my god, there's a clapper actually said that Obama had something to do anything.
[03:22:34.840 --> 03:22:35.801]  I know this!
[03:22:36.590 --> 03:22:39.132]  Did you see the F the FISA warrants?
[03:22:39.212 --> 03:22:41.133]  Oh my god, it was terrible!
[03:22:41.194 --> 03:22:47.718]  They actually based the FISA warrant on some made-up contrived lie paid for by Hillary Clinton!
[03:22:48.019 --> 03:22:48.999]  I know that!
[03:22:49.540 --> 03:22:50.661]  You've been saying that!
[03:22:50.741 --> 03:22:51.942]  What are you gonna do about it?
[03:22:52.142 --> 03:22:54.263]  I don't know, we're just gonna keep talking about it!
[03:22:54.864 --> 03:22:58.567]  We're just gonna keep talking about it online and say, hey!
[03:22:59.768 --> 03:22:59.828]  Ooh!
[03:23:00.848 --> 03:23:02.309]  Hillary's laughing her ass off!
[03:23:02.369 --> 03:23:04.251]  By the way, did you see her this week?
[03:23:05.242 --> 03:23:06.682]  Come on, fellas, gals.
[03:23:07.222 --> 03:23:09.363]  Did you see her wearing the bedspread at Ozzy Fest?
[03:23:09.383 --> 03:23:10.283]  What was that, Central Park?
[03:23:10.923 --> 03:23:12.023]  Oh, my God!
[03:23:12.083 --> 03:23:14.124]  First of all, she was wearing the oven mitt outfit.
[03:23:14.644 --> 03:23:17.404]  You know, ladies, she was wearing the oven mitt, then the mild bunker gear.
[03:23:17.784 --> 03:23:21.365]  Then she's walking around with the back brace, the reptilian exoskeleton.
[03:23:21.385 --> 03:23:22.245]  I don't know what the hell that is.
[03:23:22.485 --> 03:23:23.225]  And then she shows up.
[03:23:23.285 --> 03:23:24.445]  What the hell is this thing?
[03:23:24.945 --> 03:23:25.966]  She rolled out of bed.
[03:23:26.326 --> 03:23:28.386]  Grandma put on her muumuu or her nightgown.
[03:23:28.666 --> 03:23:30.847]  They rolled her out wearing the support shoes.
[03:23:31.187 --> 03:23:33.447]  I mean, what is going on?
[03:23:33.547 --> 03:23:34.227]  What's going on here?
[03:23:34.667 --> 03:23:38.669]  Listen, I don't mean anybody any kind of harm, but what is that?
[03:23:38.769 --> 03:23:39.729]  Mama Cass!
[03:23:40.350 --> 03:23:42.551]  I mean, what is happening?
[03:23:43.031 --> 03:23:46.492]  As long as she walks free, there is no justice.
[03:23:47.252 --> 03:23:56.496]  This woman, how many laws does she have to break before somebody says, OK, now we got to do something?
[03:23:57.802 --> 03:23:58.903]  There's so much stuff.
[03:23:59.203 --> 03:24:00.244]  Remember the old days?
[03:24:00.424 --> 03:24:01.165]  Here's one for you.
[03:24:01.325 --> 03:24:02.526]  Eric Bren, who's that?
[03:24:02.646 --> 03:24:03.627]  Eric Bren's my hero.
[03:24:03.727 --> 03:24:16.299]  Eric Bren was a fellow on Ed Sullivan's show who had a million plates and bowls and he would spin them simultaneously because you've got to have 50 different stories going in your head at any time and they're all mutually exclusive and your head will
[03:24:17.051 --> 03:24:17.891]  Blow apart!
[03:24:18.472 --> 03:24:20.232]  What story do you want to talk about?
[03:24:20.673 --> 03:24:22.473]  What's driving you crazy?
[03:24:22.654 --> 03:24:23.534]  I mean, seriously, what?
[03:24:23.814 --> 03:24:28.216]  Somebody mentioned before China and vaccines, autism, race, 9-11.
[03:24:28.236 --> 03:24:29.457]  9-11 is always there.
[03:24:29.737 --> 03:24:33.358]  And now we have this group of people called pedophiles.
[03:24:33.618 --> 03:24:43.523]  Listen, I'm not going to tell you and I don't think anybody's going to tell you and I don't think anybody has to tell you the motivation behind what these sick
[03:24:44.235 --> 03:24:46.176]  These sick cabals are.
[03:24:46.716 --> 03:24:50.177]  These covens of deranged individuals.
[03:24:50.277 --> 03:24:51.097]  I'm not going to go through.
[03:24:51.177 --> 03:24:52.278]  You know the routine.
[03:24:52.358 --> 03:24:52.998]  We know it.
[03:24:53.498 --> 03:24:54.398]  We know what they do.
[03:24:54.458 --> 03:24:57.219]  We know why kids, you know, pedivores and all that jazz.
[03:24:57.239 --> 03:24:59.780]  We know everything from cannibalism to organ harvesting.
[03:25:00.040 --> 03:25:01.301]  We know all the stories.
[03:25:01.741 --> 03:25:02.981]  We know that they do that.
[03:25:03.862 --> 03:25:07.783]  It doesn't matter why they do that.
[03:25:09.315 --> 03:25:30.088]  And Mr. President, if you don't go in there and blow this thing up figuratively, to use the media term, if you don't start with Harvey Weinstein and NXIVM and Allison Mack, and everybody, and start getting them in, and Anthony Weiner, and whatever happened to his laptop, and whatever happened to the life insurance policy, what happened to all this stuff?
[03:25:30.388 --> 03:25:31.609]  What is going on here?
[03:25:32.270 --> 03:25:33.713]  I'm getting sick and tired.
[03:25:33.793 --> 03:25:37.260]  God bless Alex, but Alex is driving me crazy in a good way!
[03:25:37.621 --> 03:25:39.685]  Because every day he's reminding me of another thing.
[03:25:39.705 --> 03:25:41.349]  He's like, what the hell are we talking about?
[03:25:42.030 --> 03:25:42.772]  We know this!
[03:25:43.559 --> 03:25:48.202]  It's like we're standing here, we're seeing this house that's, well, what's that?
[03:25:48.302 --> 03:25:49.543]  Smells like fire.
[03:25:49.563 --> 03:25:50.144]  Yeah.
[03:25:50.564 --> 03:25:53.886]  Well, did somebody call the fire department?
[03:25:54.467 --> 03:25:57.469]  Oh, the flames are coming out of the bottom floor there.
[03:25:58.129 --> 03:25:59.730]  Oh, you know, that thing could go up.
[03:25:59.851 --> 03:26:01.652]  Anybody call the fire department?
[03:26:01.712 --> 03:26:03.473]  Nah, let's just talk about it.
[03:26:04.494 --> 03:26:05.615]  Fire department's coming?
[03:26:05.975 --> 03:26:06.315]  Nope.
[03:26:07.016 --> 03:26:08.417]  We're just going to talk about it.
[03:26:08.757 --> 03:26:10.338]  Oh, gee, that's a shame.
[03:26:10.558 --> 03:26:12.920]  Can you hear the screams of the people in that fire?
[03:26:13.863 --> 03:26:16.064]  Why don't, what are we doing talking about it?
[03:26:16.184 --> 03:26:18.725]  Let's do, grab a bucket of hoes.
[03:26:18.805 --> 03:26:20.005]  No, come on.
[03:26:20.866 --> 03:26:22.286]  It's just fun to talk about it.
[03:26:23.467 --> 03:26:25.568]  Mr. President, I don't know what's going on.
[03:26:25.948 --> 03:26:27.628]  Let me tell you, it's very simple.
[03:26:28.109 --> 03:26:40.293]  Can you imagine if one day, just one day, you know, I'm from Florida, and I guess you folks from Texas, wherever it is, but we had fire ants, not Florida, Florida, fire ants.
[03:26:40.754 --> 03:26:41.834]  We had these mounds.
[03:26:42.651 --> 03:26:47.495]  And I used to, this was great as a kid, step on them and then step back and watch.
[03:26:48.176 --> 03:26:51.238]  And they would come on and say, who stepped on this?
[03:26:51.298 --> 03:26:56.102]  And they would be just waiting, looking around, saying, we're going to get.
[03:26:56.442 --> 03:27:04.188]  And there was chaos and they're bumping into each other when you're buzzing around or whatever they, whatever they do, they hum, they buzz, whatever they do.
[03:27:06.270 --> 03:27:09.653]  If all of a sudden the president announced the first indictment against Hillary Clinton,
[03:27:10.413 --> 03:27:11.733]  The mainstream media would melt.
[03:27:11.893 --> 03:27:14.414]  Wolf Blitzer would have a conniption, whatever a conniption is.
[03:27:14.474 --> 03:27:15.794]  My mother talked about a conniption fit.
[03:27:15.814 --> 03:27:16.514]  I don't know what that is.
[03:27:16.954 --> 03:27:19.015]  Rachel Maddow would have to be sedated.
[03:27:19.355 --> 03:27:20.255]  They wouldn't know what to do.
[03:27:20.635 --> 03:27:22.416]  All of their anti-Trump stuff would stop.
[03:27:23.076 --> 03:27:23.556]  That would be it.
[03:27:23.896 --> 03:27:24.216]  Next.
[03:27:25.876 --> 03:27:36.219]  I don't know what the president is talking about or what, excuse me, when he brought up the fact of Barack Obama and his birth certificate.
[03:27:36.499 --> 03:27:37.599]  This is the Constitution.
[03:27:38.323 --> 03:27:48.089]  And Article 2 is very, very clear here regarding a 35-year-old president who's been a 14-year-old resident who is a natural-born citizen.
[03:27:48.389 --> 03:27:52.732]  Now, either you have this or you don't.
[03:27:54.333 --> 03:27:57.515]  Either there's evidence of this or there's not.
[03:27:57.875 --> 03:28:02.578]  Or somebody said, well, you don't want to bring that one up.
[03:28:02.718 --> 03:28:03.079]  Why?
[03:28:03.319 --> 03:28:06.541]  Well, because what would happen if all of a sudden you said, hey, guess what?
[03:28:07.344 --> 03:28:11.748]  You've got a president here, who by the way was born, let's forget it, don't call it Kenya, call it Italy.
[03:28:11.969 --> 03:28:12.489]  I don't care.
[03:28:12.509 --> 03:28:14.731]  Or as we say here in New York, Italy.
[03:28:14.751 --> 03:28:19.095]  You've got a president who was, is it what, Void Abinishio?
[03:28:19.376 --> 03:28:25.361]  I asked a legal scholar, a friend of mine, one of my juridical mentors, I said, what, seriously, what happened?
[03:28:26.362 --> 03:28:30.907]  If they realize that every single thing that was ever done by Barack Obama is void.
[03:28:31.998 --> 03:28:34.559]  The Congress could theoretically ratify everything?
[03:28:35.079 --> 03:28:36.879]  Then you've got Julian Assange.
[03:28:36.919 --> 03:28:48.782]  Mr. President, in the waning seconds of this segment, thank you for pardoning Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio, but pardon Julian Assange!
[03:28:49.242 --> 03:28:51.043]  What are we waiting for?
[03:28:51.063 --> 03:28:52.843]  I've got more coming up.
[03:28:52.963 --> 03:28:53.804]  This is Lionel.
[03:28:54.124 --> 03:28:55.104]  If you can take it.
[03:28:59.645 --> 03:29:10.593]  Any student of military history, in all of recorded time, will tell you that stealth and sneak attack is absolutely critical in any offensive war.
[03:29:11.874 --> 03:29:15.717]  The Democrats, the CHICOM's funding them, Hollywood,
[03:29:16.718 --> 03:29:28.892]  The whole EU unelected bureaucracy is in a combine against nation states and against free market capitalism in a global corporate takeover backed up by paramilitary UN force.
[03:29:29.653 --> 03:29:30.574]  NATO is their army.
[03:29:31.075 --> 03:29:31.475]  Right now!
[03:29:32.196 --> 03:29:34.377]  The Democrats are making their move.
[03:29:35.378 --> 03:29:44.163]  For the last year and a half, in policy papers, they said we're going to overthrow the President using the military, or using 25th Amendment, and we're going to build the case through made-up Russia collusion.
[03:29:44.683 --> 03:29:52.548]  When I would point out the white papers, they'd say, oh, that's crazy, it doesn't exist, because they wanted to build up their forces and get geared up and get ready to make their move.
[03:29:52.848 --> 03:29:57.551]  Now, that President Trump's been in a little over a year and a half, and we enter the summer of rage,
[03:29:58.431 --> 03:30:11.257]  Congressmen, Senators, former CIA Deputy Directors, FBI Deputy Directors, you name it, former CIA Directors, they're all over the news saying, we're making our move, Trump is a Russian agent, we're going to remove him from office.
[03:30:11.677 --> 03:30:22.722]  This is insane, and they've got a bunch of cowardly Republicans who want to sit on the fence, in case this coup is successful, going, oh yeah, maybe it is bad he met with Putin, maybe he is selling us out.
[03:30:23.562 --> 03:30:26.523]  Trump has been crushing Russia with our energy deals.
[03:30:26.943 --> 03:30:32.284]  Trump has been crushing Russia shipping heavy anti-tank weapons into Ukraine against the Russians.
[03:30:32.724 --> 03:30:34.545]  Trump has been putting massive sanctions on them.
[03:30:34.885 --> 03:30:39.206]  But his rhetoric is friendly to make Russia capitulate and make a deal.
[03:30:39.606 --> 03:30:42.887]  And quite frankly, it's offensive and probably not right what the president's doing.
[03:30:43.207 --> 03:30:46.668]  But you could see it in America's interest, but kind of in an imperial way.
[03:30:47.188 --> 03:30:49.369]  Trump is so pro-America, it's insane.
[03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:51.070]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[03:30:51.270 --> 03:30:52.490]  The economy's turning around.
[03:30:52.870 --> 03:30:59.013]  The traitors of globalism in the Democratic Party and the blue-blood Republicans are the ones that are anti-nation-state.
[03:30:59.353 --> 03:31:02.174]  They're the ones transferring power to the UN and the TPP.
[03:31:02.674 --> 03:31:03.795]  All the things Trump's killed.
[03:31:04.015 --> 03:31:11.680]  America was basically wearing a ball and chain, and Trump has removed it, and he's returning power back to the states, back to the people.
[03:31:11.900 --> 03:31:13.461]  He's acting as our real president.
[03:31:13.822 --> 03:31:16.403]  Even if you don't agree with some of what he says or does, it doesn't matter.
[03:31:16.683 --> 03:31:17.924]  He really is the president now.
[03:31:18.305 --> 03:31:25.429]  And the bureaucracy, and the lobbyists, and the globalists, and the chi-coms that own our debt and control Hollywood, thought they had this country.
[03:31:25.769 --> 03:31:30.993]  The communist Chinese newspapers admit they're at war with us right now, economically and building up militarily.
[03:31:31.273 --> 03:31:32.094]  They're the big threat.
[03:31:32.634 --> 03:31:34.976]  Russia can't even keep its own country together.
[03:31:35.256 --> 03:31:37.577]  It's being targeted by Soros just like we are.
[03:31:38.078 --> 03:31:42.841]  And that's the only truth in the Russian collusion, is that Russia has the same enemies that America has.
[03:31:43.321 --> 03:31:45.462]  And Russia is being targeted just like we are.
[03:31:45.743 --> 03:31:49.045]  And they're making their move against the President right now.
[03:31:49.645 --> 03:31:56.652]  They've been hyping it and, you know, pushing that they're going to remove him so long to get you punch drunk for when they finally make their move.
[03:31:57.012 --> 03:32:02.577]  But all of us, as Americans, need to understand they've tried to create race wars, class wars, sex wars.
[03:32:02.637 --> 03:32:04.279]  They've tried to divide us every way they can.
[03:32:04.559 --> 03:32:05.560]  They admit they're doing it.
[03:32:05.920 --> 03:32:06.821]  They are the globalists.
[03:32:06.881 --> 03:32:07.502]  They are the enemy.
[03:32:07.702 --> 03:32:22.573]  And it's up to us to call Congress, to call talk radio, to get involved more now than ever against all the internet censorship that they're trying to bring in ahead of a coup against the president and a coup against the electorate in this country that elected him.
[03:32:23.013 --> 03:32:31.460]  This is a war against America trying to have its own self-determination, just like Theresa May is trying to say they're not going to follow the vote for Brexit right now in England.
[03:32:31.920 --> 03:32:32.540]  We're good to go.
[03:33:03.251 --> 03:33:05.973]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.882 --> 03:33:20.723]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.743 --> 03:33:22.004]  Because there is a war on.
[03:33:22.084 --> 03:33:22.624]  Or you're mine.
[03:33:34.665 --> 03:33:36.587]  Now we have to keep it going.
[03:33:36.807 --> 03:33:37.948]  We cannot stop.
[03:33:38.228 --> 03:33:41.031]  And we have to be supporting each other.
[03:33:41.051 --> 03:33:48.537]  You know, it's kind of exhausting to be part of protesting and marching and demonstrating and resisting.
[03:33:50.359 --> 03:33:57.325]  I've been back there listening to Randy and I'm so exhausted I can barely stand here.
[03:34:17.478 --> 03:34:18.118]  And there you have it.
[03:34:18.538 --> 03:34:19.279]  There you have it.
[03:34:20.739 --> 03:34:22.220]  This woman, bless her heart.
[03:34:22.260 --> 03:34:23.000]  I want to keep going.
[03:34:23.020 --> 03:34:23.780]  I want to keep talking.
[03:34:23.860 --> 03:34:25.981]  I want to keep just going at this.
[03:34:26.141 --> 03:34:31.023]  Oh, by the way, you can reach me on Twitter at Lionel Media.
[03:34:31.463 --> 03:34:33.224]  But I'm shadow banned.
[03:34:33.244 --> 03:34:38.566]  And I'm looking around here and I don't even think I said, well, is Paul Watson shadow banned?
[03:34:38.786 --> 03:34:39.586]  No.
[03:34:39.886 --> 03:34:40.987]  Is David Nye shadow banned?
[03:34:41.027 --> 03:34:41.967]  And I'm glad of that.
[03:34:42.227 --> 03:34:42.968]  No.
[03:34:43.788 --> 03:34:44.728]  Why me?
[03:34:45.388 --> 03:34:46.409]  What have I done?
[03:34:47.225 --> 03:34:49.006]  What's going on here?
[03:34:49.026 --> 03:34:49.066]  Me?
[03:34:49.806 --> 03:34:50.406]  Moi?
[03:34:51.667 --> 03:34:52.607]  Shadowband?
[03:34:52.687 --> 03:34:55.148]  I don't understand it.
[03:34:55.588 --> 03:34:56.789]  I don't get this thing.
[03:34:57.749 --> 03:35:04.751]  You know, our biggest problem and your biggest problem is I keep asking the damn question that everybody wants to answer.
[03:35:04.771 --> 03:35:07.693]  And that basically is what's going on here.
[03:35:07.733 --> 03:35:08.653]  And I was mentioning this before.
[03:35:10.080 --> 03:35:16.667]  Unless and until somehow people say, hey, did you hear anything about this pedal thing and what have you?
[03:35:17.147 --> 03:35:22.032]  I've got to just get to this because I don't want to lose my time.
[03:35:22.713 --> 03:35:26.537]  I'm very, very, I'm very biased when it comes to this.
[03:35:26.557 --> 03:35:27.178]  Look at this guy.
[03:35:28.030 --> 03:35:29.712]  Look at this punk.
[03:35:30.332 --> 03:35:33.335]  Who does he think he is?
[03:35:33.855 --> 03:35:35.357]  He's too cool.
[03:35:35.977 --> 03:35:36.758]  You don't understand.
[03:35:36.878 --> 03:35:37.939]  I think funny thing.
[03:35:38.119 --> 03:35:39.301]  And there's these other people too.
[03:35:39.321 --> 03:35:40.902]  You can go through the list of others.
[03:35:41.783 --> 03:35:48.129]  And the best part about it was who was this Cernovich or others who, you know, bless his heart going after these people.
[03:35:48.529 --> 03:35:50.431]  And then you have Sarah Silverman saying, oh,
[03:35:51.326 --> 03:35:53.967]  You'd better watch out, you, you.
[03:35:54.347 --> 03:35:55.627]  And then they go through their list.
[03:35:55.707 --> 03:35:59.228]  You, um, you, uh, you, uh, Nazi.
[03:35:59.508 --> 03:36:00.088]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:36:00.128 --> 03:36:02.548]  You're a Nazi and you're an alt-right.
[03:36:02.748 --> 03:36:04.209]  They have no idea what they're talking about.
[03:36:04.229 --> 03:36:06.849]  They're saying, excuse me, what is alt-right about this?
[03:36:07.469 --> 03:36:07.970]  What is alt-right?
[03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:09.610]  Look at this, how pizza gave Pusher.
[03:36:10.770 --> 03:36:14.731]  You know, I'm thinking to myself, listen, are you, ignore him.
[03:36:16.544 --> 03:36:18.085]  Listen, I don't want to say anything bad about Mike.
[03:36:19.206 --> 03:36:23.791]  I respect anybody who's a, frankly, a ball buster and anybody who mixes it up.
[03:36:24.531 --> 03:36:25.292]  No, I'm serious.
[03:36:27.634 --> 03:36:28.355]  Laura Loomer.
[03:36:28.735 --> 03:36:30.237]  Hell, even this Tommy Lahren.
[03:36:30.257 --> 03:36:31.818]  It doesn't matter.
[03:36:31.858 --> 03:36:34.581]  Somebody who's actually doing something and going down and raising hell.
[03:36:35.296 --> 03:36:37.017]  We'll be Goldberg for whatever it's worth!
[03:36:37.037 --> 03:36:38.897]  Jeanine Pirro, by the way, that's a work.
[03:36:39.277 --> 03:36:40.418]  Did you hear that story?
[03:36:41.018 --> 03:36:42.238]  You know about professional rights, right?
[03:36:42.258 --> 03:36:43.539]  It's kayfabe, it's a work.
[03:36:43.619 --> 03:36:46.700]  It's, I mean, it's just, Jeanine, please!
[03:36:47.020 --> 03:36:48.421]  But that's for another time.
[03:36:48.661 --> 03:36:50.021]  Remind me to tell you about that one.
[03:36:51.422 --> 03:37:01.125]  But when, but instead of these people saying, how that, you know, let's say I'm Bob Iger, how that everybody come in here, sit down, and my big pollution man, can you tell me this thing, who is tweeting this?
[03:37:01.846 --> 03:37:03.988]  Whose idea of fun... Excuse me, Bob.
[03:37:04.048 --> 03:37:05.549]  Don't call me Bob.
[03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:07.251]  What is it, Mr. Iger?
[03:37:07.311 --> 03:37:07.772]  What is it?
[03:37:07.832 --> 03:37:09.053]  Or whoever they put it.
[03:37:09.513 --> 03:37:12.596]  You see, this is what we think is funny.
[03:37:14.818 --> 03:37:15.739]  I'm Disney!
[03:37:16.159 --> 03:37:16.780]  You idiots!
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:18.041]  This is Marvel.
[03:37:18.081 --> 03:37:19.362]  We're talking about Comic-Con.
[03:37:19.803 --> 03:37:21.444]  What is the matter with you?
[03:37:22.145 --> 03:37:23.186]  What is the matter?
[03:37:23.446 --> 03:37:24.527]  Who did this?
[03:37:25.708 --> 03:37:26.509]  We did this.
[03:37:27.129 --> 03:37:27.470]  When?
[03:37:28.664 --> 03:37:29.705]  Why are you doing this?
[03:37:29.945 --> 03:37:30.585]  Why are you?
[03:37:30.926 --> 03:37:32.827]  And who was the one who went after Cernovich?
[03:37:33.067 --> 03:37:34.608]  Leave him alone!
[03:37:35.249 --> 03:37:36.310]  What are you doing?
[03:37:36.710 --> 03:37:38.811]  Let this go away!
[03:37:39.272 --> 03:37:47.618]  If anybody in my organization tweets this, you think we, we, uh, S-canned Roseanne Quaffack?
[03:37:47.938 --> 03:37:49.219]  Oh, you'll be history!
[03:37:49.699 --> 03:37:51.140]  We don't talk about this.
[03:37:51.421 --> 03:37:52.221]  We don't do this.
[03:37:52.381 --> 03:37:53.162]  Hey, folks!
[03:37:54.196 --> 03:37:55.957]  Attention here, a little inter-office memo.
[03:37:56.197 --> 03:37:58.918]  Pedophilia is not funny!
[03:37:59.778 --> 03:38:01.579]  I don't know where you're from.
[03:38:01.979 --> 03:38:05.560]  I don't know where this, how this came about.
[03:38:06.181 --> 03:38:13.864]  How maybe it's some weird kind of a burning man kind of cool thing where you say, hey, we're into pedophile humor.
[03:38:14.124 --> 03:38:15.544]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:38:15.864 --> 03:38:17.445]  You can do this on your time.
[03:38:18.065 --> 03:38:21.847]  You can do it and you can go to your little baristas and you hang around and whatever you do.
[03:38:23.314 --> 03:38:28.516]  And you can do whatever to each other and yell, but not on our time.
[03:38:28.956 --> 03:38:31.117]  We are dying over here.
[03:38:31.437 --> 03:38:33.378]  They're cutting the cord.
[03:38:33.778 --> 03:38:35.239]  We need these people.
[03:38:35.739 --> 03:38:37.660]  What are you doing?
[03:38:38.360 --> 03:38:39.921]  This isn't funny.
[03:38:40.501 --> 03:38:42.001]  Now, I don't know what's going on here.
[03:38:43.102 --> 03:38:44.162]  I don't know where it came from.
[03:38:44.783 --> 03:38:47.524]  Catholic Church, Jimmy Savile.
[03:38:47.724 --> 03:38:48.604]  It goes down the list.
[03:38:48.764 --> 03:38:49.464]  And what?
[03:38:49.564 --> 03:38:50.225]  And Hollywood.
[03:38:50.485 --> 03:38:50.705]  Look.
[03:38:51.554 --> 03:38:53.416]  Everybody pay attention to something.
[03:38:54.237 --> 03:38:57.440]  There's a documentary coming out now by the fellow named Scotty Bowers.
[03:38:57.760 --> 03:39:03.205]  Scotty Bowers has a documentary about when he was in Hollywood in the 40s.
[03:39:03.805 --> 03:39:09.050]  And he was a Marine who showed up at a gas station on Hollywood and Van Ness or whatever.
[03:39:09.351 --> 03:39:10.331]  And he's there one day.
[03:39:10.371 --> 03:39:11.092]  This is in the 40s or 50s.
[03:39:12.273 --> 03:39:27.108]  Just the youngest strapping Marine out of work and all of a sudden who pulls in but everybody in Hollywood Walter Pidgeon Spencer Tracy you name it and all of them are not only closeted not that
[03:39:27.108 --> 03:39:34.693]  If there's anything wrong with that, but in the 40s and 50s, you know, Jack Warner and these guys, they they kept a lid on that.
[03:39:34.753 --> 03:39:35.694]  You did this.
[03:39:35.794 --> 03:39:36.934]  Not this didn't go on.
[03:39:37.295 --> 03:39:41.417]  Rock Hudson marrying his, you know, his secretary.
[03:39:41.777 --> 03:39:42.218]  What do you like?
[03:39:42.658 --> 03:39:43.839]  Spencer Tracy.
[03:39:43.939 --> 03:39:49.002]  But these guys are freaks from Joan Crawford.
[03:39:49.442 --> 03:39:52.344]  That has always been Hollywood.
[03:39:52.484 --> 03:39:53.425]  But let me tell you the difference.
[03:39:54.125 --> 03:39:54.866]  There was no Internet.
[03:39:55.703 --> 03:39:57.605]  But this mentality continued.
[03:39:58.626 --> 03:40:01.969]  And let me tell you also, do you know when it really gets good?
[03:40:02.710 --> 03:40:08.836]  If you want to see Freak City whenever you have any kind of an award ceremony.
[03:40:09.455 --> 03:40:29.080]  Any kind of an award or anything in New York at the Met or the galas, wherever these people move in, wherever they just assemble and they get to live in this weird bubble that says, we're protected, we're special.
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:30.980]  Let me tell you something.
[03:40:31.480 --> 03:40:33.661]  This is going to bring them down.
[03:40:34.101 --> 03:40:35.081]  Let me also tell you.
[03:40:36.161 --> 03:40:38.082]  Somebody needs to get a hold of Harvey Weinstein.
[03:40:39.065 --> 03:40:40.526]  Yes, I mean, I can't.
[03:40:40.606 --> 03:40:41.566]  This is personal.
[03:40:43.426 --> 03:40:49.509]  On a personal note, when I prosecuted, I saw some stuff that was pretty bad, but nothing.
[03:40:50.769 --> 03:40:52.990]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:40:54.290 --> 03:40:58.912]  Affected any more like juvenile cases, dependencies.
[03:41:00.872 --> 03:41:02.433]  Child sexual predation.
[03:41:04.374 --> 03:41:05.554]  You don't know what it's like.
[03:41:06.926 --> 03:41:11.188]  Everybody has something, maybe somebody in their family, the number of people who have had something happen to them.
[03:41:12.869 --> 03:41:35.698]  But when you really understand that something that is so medievally, naturally against the laws of nature are now a part of a systematic exhibition sport, some weird
[03:41:36.753 --> 03:41:38.054]  I don't know what you want to call it.
[03:41:38.514 --> 03:41:49.778]  Some medieval, organized, spectator sport, horror, where kids are part of movement and child trafficking.
[03:41:50.018 --> 03:41:50.898]  There is a movie out.
[03:41:50.918 --> 03:41:51.538]  Have you seen it?
[03:41:52.159 --> 03:41:53.199]  It's the new.
[03:41:54.879 --> 03:41:55.800]  Oh, what is his name?
[03:41:55.900 --> 03:41:59.061]  The new Benicio Del Toro movie where he plays the assassin.
[03:41:59.381 --> 03:42:01.002]  And they asked if I remember my guy's name.
[03:42:03.019 --> 03:42:05.229]  Anyway, you'll know what his name is, the name of it.
[03:42:05.470 --> 03:42:07.117]  And there's one particular scene where they ask him, they said,
[03:42:07.922 --> 03:42:09.923]  What's being trafficked today?
[03:42:10.003 --> 03:42:11.884]  Somebody said, you know, it used to be drugs.
[03:42:12.224 --> 03:42:13.264]  But drugs are too much.
[03:42:13.764 --> 03:42:14.725]  Too much money.
[03:42:15.245 --> 03:42:17.726]  Too much money to cultivate the cocaine.
[03:42:18.026 --> 03:42:19.226]  To have the fields.
[03:42:19.527 --> 03:42:21.147]  To pay off all these people.
[03:42:21.247 --> 03:42:21.547]  No!
[03:42:22.067 --> 03:42:24.108]  Now it's human trafficking.
[03:42:24.729 --> 03:42:28.590]  And human trafficking in children acting as mules.
[03:42:29.190 --> 03:42:31.831]  Layer upon layer of child predation.
[03:42:32.331 --> 03:42:36.313]  It is bigger than anything sicario.
[03:42:37.922 --> 03:42:42.566]  This, how they let this movie through, this is actually very good.
[03:42:43.147 --> 03:42:48.931]  If ever there was not a movie in support of a second Trump term, this is it.
[03:42:49.512 --> 03:42:53.275]  The level of depravity is not Alex hyping it up.
[03:42:53.735 --> 03:42:54.576]  This is real.
[03:42:54.896 --> 03:42:55.657]  This is sick.
[03:42:55.977 --> 03:42:57.518]  And we're going to continue talking about it.
[03:42:57.638 --> 03:42:58.179]  Stay tuned.
[03:42:59.841 --> 03:43:03.985]  This country is now officially in a state of civil war.
[03:43:04.765 --> 03:43:12.772]  Multiple members of Congress, rabid Democrats, have called for a military coup against President Donald J. Trump.
[03:43:13.213 --> 03:43:22.200]  We also have former Deputy Director of the FBI and Deputy Director of the CIA coming out and calling for the, quote, deep state to remove the President.
[03:43:23.061 --> 03:43:30.525]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you saw that going on in Russia, our news media would accurately say that they were in a state of civil war.
[03:43:30.805 --> 03:43:34.307]  If you saw that happening in the EU, that would be an accurate assumption.
[03:43:34.788 --> 03:43:41.632]  Even a few weeks ago, USA Today interviewed professors that said they believe we were already in the early stages of a civil war.
[03:43:42.552 --> 03:43:52.317]  I have been ridiculed for pointing out the Democrats the last year and a half were quietly planning it in their own policy papers funded by George Soros and others.
[03:43:52.657 --> 03:43:56.459]  But now it's out in the open and this country is in maximum danger.
[03:43:57.099 --> 03:44:04.303]  They are trying to induce Trump derangement syndrome onto CNN and MSNBC and NPR audiences.
[03:44:05.203 --> 03:44:22.439]  To believe the hysteria that Russia wants to build walls, that Russia wants to expand our military, that Russia wants to bring our economy back, that Russia wants to devastate its own oil and gas imports as Trump has done, that Russia wants Trump to ship anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to attack Russians?
[03:44:23.160 --> 03:44:28.227]  The truth is, Trump's been too hardcore on Russia because Russia hasn't done anything to the U.S.
[03:44:28.728 --> 03:44:34.796]  It's the Communist Chinese that are on record owning Hollywood, owning our national debt, and trying to basically break this country up.
[03:44:35.076 --> 03:44:36.398]  They're allied with the Democrats.
[03:44:36.698 --> 03:44:37.519]  They're the real traitors.
[03:44:37.960 --> 03:44:40.644]  That's why Congressman Stephen Cohen
[03:44:41.044 --> 03:44:49.334]  Has called for a military coup against the president because he is a traitor working with the chi-coms, working with the multinational corporations.
[03:44:49.735 --> 03:44:56.063]  That's why Phil Mudd of the CIA and the FBI has come out on CNN just last night.
[03:44:56.303 --> 03:44:56.443]  Yes.
[03:45:12.245 --> 03:45:16.426]  Uh, for pointing out that Trump's just trying to stop a new Cold War from taking place.
[03:45:16.466 --> 03:45:24.128]  And then former CIA director Brennan, who's a Wahhabist, who was an admitted communist in college, voted as a communist after he was in college.
[03:45:24.548 --> 03:45:29.910]  Uh, this anti-American piece of garbage has been caught illegally spying on the president back when he was in the campaign.
[03:45:29.930 --> 03:45:32.811]  And then once he was president elect, he's been caught lying to Congress.
[03:45:33.191 --> 03:45:40.073]  This guy is saying that Trump is treasonous and that Trump needs to be politically paralyzed and removed.
[03:45:40.573 --> 03:45:41.133]  They want
[03:45:42.611 --> 03:45:48.332]  25th Amendment invoked, and they're calling for people inside Trump's cabinet to call for him to be removed.
[03:45:48.712 --> 03:45:50.672]  This isn't just a civil war they've kicked off.
[03:45:51.112 --> 03:46:05.395]  It is an attempted coup that is in plain view, and the public and everyone else must respond by calling Congress, calling the president, and calling other individuals in our government and telling them, stand by the election, stand by the voters, stand by the republic.
[03:46:05.735 --> 03:46:07.275]  My goodness, the country's coming back.
[03:46:07.355 --> 03:46:08.535]  So many great things are happening.
[03:46:08.736 --> 03:46:11.476]  We're making the nation great again, and these traitors can't stand it.
[03:46:11.816 --> 03:46:14.798]  That said, InfoWars is under unprecedented attack as well.
[03:46:15.259 --> 03:46:18.801]  As you see thousands of articles a week saying, shut us down, take us off the air.
[03:46:19.141 --> 03:46:27.107]  Without you spreading the word, the articles, the videos, without you buying products at InfoWarsStore.com, they will defeat us as a key outpost in the fight against globalism.
[03:46:27.247 --> 03:46:27.968]  Spread the articles.
[03:46:28.008 --> 03:46:28.908]  Spread the videos.
[03:46:29.148 --> 03:46:33.612]  Subscribe to the new official InfoWars app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:46:33.632 --> 03:46:34.693]  Sign up for our free newsletter.
[03:46:35.053 --> 03:46:39.216]  Spread our articles to everyone you know continually as an act of resistance against the globalists.

[03:46:47.782 --> 03:46:51.265]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've backed InfoWars for more than 20 years and I want to thank you all.
[03:46:51.505 --> 03:46:57.108]  But now it's more critical than ever to go to InfowarStore.com and support the Infowar while getting great products.
[03:46:57.368 --> 03:46:58.209]  God bless you all.
[03:47:03.332 --> 03:47:05.993]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.481 --> 03:47:26.343]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[03:47:26.823 --> 03:47:30.805]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:34.807 --> 03:47:37.888]  Riders on the storm!
[03:47:38.308 --> 03:47:39.028]  Ethel Merman.
[03:47:40.089 --> 03:47:43.671]  My friends, I gotta stop right now and I've gotta say... I know.
[03:47:43.691 --> 03:47:45.952]  I feel your pain.
[03:47:46.612 --> 03:47:47.172]  I swear to you.
[03:47:49.858 --> 03:47:52.500]  Do you know what it's like knowing what we know?
[03:47:52.520 --> 03:48:01.849]  Do you have friends of yours that when you go out, maybe to eat or something, or you talk, and you realize, my God, they have no idea.
[03:48:01.889 --> 03:48:02.889]  Don't you kind of envy them?
[03:48:04.251 --> 03:48:13.779]  Do you think that we should like talking about pedophilia?
[03:48:13.819 --> 03:48:16.942]  Did you ever think that one day you would wake up and
[03:48:17.947 --> 03:48:39.177]  Rather than talking about the military, or war, or the economy, or whatever it is that you normally talk about, we're talking about how we live in a society where some millionaire whatever is actually lauding, celebrating, laughing about
[03:48:41.121 --> 03:49:00.430]  This, the abuse of children and other people, who is it, Selma Blair or others, or Sarah Silverman, are defending tweets that celebrate... I mean, I do not understand it.
[03:49:00.770 --> 03:49:05.172]  Have you seen this other fellow, who is it, Ian Black, or what's his name, the other guys?
[03:49:05.232 --> 03:49:10.594]  I mean, this is just... I'm thinking to myself, this can't be happening.
[03:49:11.647 --> 03:49:13.068]  Who is even arguing this?
[03:49:13.708 --> 03:49:16.529]  Who is saying, wait a minute, you can't do that?
[03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:37.437]  And yet when somebody brings up, and I have said before, the Pizzagate stuff was handled absolutely poorly, because you can't jump into saying that somebody who, by the way, certainly requires a little bit more, you know, investigation.
[03:49:38.109 --> 03:49:42.630]  That that's the same as somebody actually being caught doing something.
[03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:48.192]  You see, there's a difference between probable cause and reasonable doubt.
[03:49:48.212 --> 03:49:50.132]  I'll give you a perfect example.
[03:49:51.512 --> 03:50:05.076]  Sometimes, whenever we talk about, or I talk about, 9-11, people will say, you know, on 9-11, on the days of 9-11, they found these four Israeli guys in a white van that were dancing.
[03:50:06.192 --> 03:50:12.134]  And because they were dancing, Israel was responsible for bringing down the towers.
[03:50:12.374 --> 03:50:13.415]  Wait a minute, what?
[03:50:13.975 --> 03:50:16.596]  Yeah, they were for Israeli dancing.
[03:50:17.516 --> 03:50:21.357]  What does that have to do with actual causal connection?
[03:50:21.437 --> 03:50:22.538]  Well, there you go.
[03:50:23.238 --> 03:50:24.278]  During the O.J.
[03:50:24.398 --> 03:50:32.341]  Simpson case, which is before your time, some, maybe, they thought everybody, they would say, maybe the sun did it.
[03:50:32.721 --> 03:50:33.422]  The sun?
[03:50:35.311 --> 03:50:35.651]  AB?
[03:50:36.232 --> 03:50:36.872]  Justin?
[03:50:37.893 --> 03:50:38.533]  Simpson?
[03:50:38.634 --> 03:50:39.514]  What are you talking about?
[03:50:40.215 --> 03:50:48.801]  We need to go back to school and say, whoa, whoa, before we continue with this, let's explain a little bit about correlation versus cause.
[03:50:49.481 --> 03:50:54.205]  Let's explain a little bit between somebody who's doing something that deserves some apes.
[03:50:54.865 --> 03:50:57.547]  Policeman, detective, follow this guy.
[03:50:58.088 --> 03:50:58.988]  That is not enough.
[03:50:59.028 --> 03:51:04.092]  Now, what Gunn wrote, or whatever, is not pedophilia.
[03:51:05.393 --> 03:51:13.154]  It is, theoretically, because that is a mind preference, a thought preference, a sexual ideation.
[03:51:13.454 --> 03:51:17.655]  It doesn't necessarily mean that it is the act itself.
[03:51:18.335 --> 03:51:23.536]  Child sexual battery is not the same as that desire which led to it.
[03:51:23.976 --> 03:51:33.878]  Paraphilia, chronophilia, hebophilia, ephebophilia, attraction for post-pubescent, an attraction
[03:51:35.204 --> 03:51:37.406]  It does not mean you have done it.
[03:51:37.587 --> 03:51:39.789]  We've mixed the words together.
[03:51:40.449 --> 03:51:43.612]  It's like when people say, this is just disgusting.
[03:51:45.013 --> 03:51:47.255]  Pedophilia describes something.
[03:51:48.376 --> 03:51:53.761]  For example, pyromania is not the same as arson.
[03:51:55.350 --> 03:51:58.412]  If I came to you and said, you know, I really want to burn down houses.
[03:51:58.893 --> 03:52:00.934]  I really want to set houses on fire.
[03:52:01.014 --> 03:52:02.495]  I really want to do this.
[03:52:02.916 --> 03:52:04.197]  I want to do this.
[03:52:04.457 --> 03:52:06.658]  You can't arrest me for a thought.
[03:52:08.180 --> 03:52:08.480]  Yet.
[03:52:09.220 --> 03:52:16.606]  Now, if I burn a house down because of insurance premiums or proceeds and the like, that's a different story.
[03:52:17.651 --> 03:52:21.332]  So pedophilia, pyromania, have nothing to do with the actual act itself.
[03:52:21.572 --> 03:52:24.692]  Just like people always say, we should impeach Trump.
[03:52:24.892 --> 03:52:26.012]  You mean convict Trump.
[03:52:26.432 --> 03:52:26.633]  What?
[03:52:27.433 --> 03:52:28.393]  You mean you want to convict him?
[03:52:28.433 --> 03:52:29.253]  No, I want to impeach him.
[03:52:29.293 --> 03:52:30.653]  You want to just charge him?
[03:52:31.513 --> 03:52:31.693]  What?
[03:52:32.173 --> 03:52:34.654]  You don't even know what impeachment is, do you?
[03:52:34.934 --> 03:52:35.594]  Not really.
[03:52:36.114 --> 03:52:37.574]  So get these words right.
[03:52:39.095 --> 03:52:40.895]  And there's something very, very scary about this.
[03:52:41.915 --> 03:52:44.496]  I don't want anybody... And this may really throw you off.
[03:52:45.036 --> 03:52:47.036]  Oh, you're going to say, what is this guy talking about?
[03:52:48.015 --> 03:52:49.876]  I don't want this gun fired.
[03:52:51.876 --> 03:52:52.877]  That's not my thing.
[03:52:54.037 --> 03:52:58.478]  I'm going to say, hey look, Selma Blair, James Gunn, you can do whatever you want.
[03:52:59.299 --> 03:52:59.779]  Keep him.
[03:52:59.859 --> 03:53:01.819]  I don't want to tell you whom to fire.
[03:53:02.159 --> 03:53:04.920]  You should be able to say anything you want.
[03:53:05.340 --> 03:53:06.481]  But then Rita, go ahead.
[03:53:07.101 --> 03:53:13.703]  Now I can say whatever I want, but my goal is not to fire people, shut people down.
[03:53:14.003 --> 03:53:15.143]  Let me ask you something.
[03:53:15.984 --> 03:53:17.044]  Please do me a favor.
[03:53:17.828 --> 03:53:18.989]  Somebody please tell me.
[03:53:20.710 --> 03:53:22.851]  And I, again, I just want to tell you this.
[03:53:23.031 --> 03:53:24.972]  I'm not calling for her firing.
[03:53:24.992 --> 03:53:28.433]  But why is Joy Rees still on MSDNC?
[03:53:28.453 --> 03:53:31.855]  I know she's on what, the graveyard shift on the weekends?
[03:53:32.235 --> 03:53:38.018]  She's between colon blow ads and the shower rape docs that block up or whatever it is.
[03:53:38.719 --> 03:53:40.780]  How is this woman still on the air?
[03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:41.780]  Again, I'm not.
[03:53:42.641 --> 03:53:44.842]  This is a woman and that expression says it all.
[03:53:44.922 --> 03:53:45.102]  What?
[03:53:46.497 --> 03:53:47.377]  Uh, A.M.
[03:53:47.437 --> 03:54:04.840]  Joy, she was, she wrote homophobic statements, Islamophobic statements, fact-shaming, I mean, she covered it in a blog she wrote years ago, which, of course, somebody went in and changed after the fact.
[03:54:05.160 --> 03:54:13.242]  Time bandits went back in time and wrote these, because the Wayback Machine and the Library of Congress says, no,
[03:54:14.523 --> 03:54:16.144]  Those comments you made, Ms.
[03:54:16.184 --> 03:54:20.846]  Reid, were made at the time you made this, years ago.
[03:54:20.946 --> 03:54:21.426]  They're there.
[03:54:21.686 --> 03:54:26.068]  We have a snapshot of that blog, or whatever it was, then.
[03:54:26.528 --> 03:54:26.849]  No.
[03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:28.169]  No, I didn't do that.
[03:54:28.549 --> 03:54:29.050]  Excuse me, Ms.
[03:54:29.070 --> 03:54:31.010]  Reid, you don't understand this.
[03:54:31.151 --> 03:54:31.971]  It was there.
[03:54:32.391 --> 03:54:39.774]  Time bandits, time travelers, using Einsteinian dynamics, went back in time, altered it.
[03:54:42.476 --> 03:54:43.196]  She's still there.
[03:54:45.023 --> 03:54:51.308]  Roseanne gets fired because they set her up, because they wanted her fired.
[03:54:51.368 --> 03:54:54.271]  Look, that whole thing, I don't know what's happening right now.
[03:54:54.611 --> 03:55:00.215]  This whole world, I guess the Obamas are in, Netflix, and then you got Valerie Jarrett here.
[03:55:00.676 --> 03:55:09.343]  But Roseanne was fired because the story goes that they think she said that Valerie Jarrett looks like an ape.
[03:55:09.863 --> 03:55:11.284]  That's what they think she said.
[03:55:11.324 --> 03:55:11.985]  She never said that.
[03:55:12.757 --> 03:55:13.578]  She never said that.
[03:55:13.958 --> 03:55:22.182]  Roseanne's problem is she's an idiot in thinking that these folks are going to understand any kind of references to dystopian plots and the like.
[03:55:22.462 --> 03:55:23.203]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:55:23.923 --> 03:55:26.745]  She's gone because they wanted her gone!
[03:55:27.395 --> 03:55:39.783]  They wanted her gone and they're so corrupt, are these people, so monumentally corrupt, is apparently ABC and these folks, that they're going to take the number one show!
[03:55:40.283 --> 03:55:45.727]  The number one show breaking all kinds of records!
[03:55:46.387 --> 03:55:51.511]  But they want her gone because she's one of them!
[03:55:52.251 --> 03:55:53.472]  And they're waiting.
[03:55:54.171 --> 03:55:55.252]  And waiting.
[03:55:55.732 --> 03:55:58.493]  And they said, we're going to whatever she says.
[03:55:58.773 --> 03:55:59.654]  How about this?
[03:56:00.474 --> 03:56:01.775]  Now, here you go.
[03:56:02.095 --> 03:56:03.836]  Valerie Jarrett, Planet of the Apes.
[03:56:04.336 --> 03:56:04.956]  That'll do.
[03:56:05.256 --> 03:56:05.557]  Next.
[03:56:06.037 --> 03:56:07.698]  Meanwhile, here comes Sarah Gilbert.
[03:56:08.038 --> 03:56:08.618]  And this and that.
[03:56:08.978 --> 03:56:16.042]  And that show is going to make My Mother the Car and Super Train look like the Mary Tyler Moore Show in comparison.
[03:56:16.462 --> 03:56:18.103]  That's how depraved these people are.
[03:56:18.403 --> 03:56:20.644]  They would kill their own prophet.
[03:56:21.304 --> 03:56:24.067]  Bottom line, just to get somebody back.
[03:56:24.527 --> 03:56:37.278]  So the bottom line, in peroration, in this valedictory of mine right now, we have so much insanity to deal with.
[03:56:37.718 --> 03:56:39.840]  So I started off by saying, number one,
[03:56:40.515 --> 03:56:42.937]  President Trump, please fire somebody.
[03:56:43.297 --> 03:56:44.578]  Please indict somebody.
[03:56:45.199 --> 03:56:48.881]  I like watching Alex, and I like watching David Knight, my good friend.
[03:56:48.921 --> 03:56:50.022]  I'm on Wednesdays with him.
[03:56:50.362 --> 03:56:51.823]  And I like watching Fox News.
[03:56:52.164 --> 03:56:56.127]  But I want you to step up and fire people.
[03:56:56.567 --> 03:56:59.549]  And I also want, number two, for you to indict Hillary Clinton.
[03:56:59.849 --> 03:57:05.754]  Number three, we appreciate you giving Dinesh D'Souza, pardoning him, what a sport!
[03:57:06.194 --> 03:57:06.895]  There you go!
[03:57:07.975 --> 03:57:08.716]  That was nice.
[03:57:08.956 --> 03:57:10.917]  Joe Arpaio, very good.
[03:57:11.597 --> 03:57:28.367]  If you don't, not only, not only pardon Julian Assange, but give him the Medal of Freedom, this man, you're in office, in essence, because he exposed that which a real media would have done.
[03:57:29.047 --> 03:57:35.551]  And finally, this pervasive pedophilia, this pederasty,
[03:57:36.169 --> 03:57:45.196]  That is somehow being shelved and being reclassified as some kind of quirky offbeat behavior has got to stop now.
[03:57:45.856 --> 03:57:46.237]  All right.
[03:57:46.737 --> 03:57:47.197]  Thank you.
[03:57:47.838 --> 03:57:48.678]  Lionel with you.
[03:57:49.419 --> 03:57:50.099]  It's all happening.
[03:57:51.640 --> 03:57:52.761]  Trump is a nationalist.
[03:57:53.782 --> 03:57:54.723]  The country's coming back.
[03:57:56.411 --> 03:58:04.697]  The globalist forces in this country, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans, are openly saying they want to remove him through a military coup, or through the 25th Amendment.
[03:58:04.797 --> 03:58:05.737]  It's unbelievable.
[03:58:06.077 --> 03:58:07.118]  It's all happening right now.
[03:58:07.618 --> 03:58:17.085]  That's why it's more important than ever that every viewer, every listener, to local radio, to TV, or over the internet, understand, your voice isn't just critical, it's essential.
[03:58:17.765 --> 03:58:25.911]  If you don't stand up and speak out, and stand up against these bullies, and point out that it's the globalists that are the ones that sold out America, not Trump, and that they're the enemy,
[03:58:26.551 --> 03:58:27.192]  They're the traitors.
[03:58:27.953 --> 03:58:29.955]  They may be successful removing our president.
[03:58:30.276 --> 03:58:32.658]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:33.139 --> 03:58:37.985]  Trump is so real, he's so hardcore, and it's so unbelievable to see that we are at this point.
[03:58:38.265 --> 03:58:40.708]  We are in the middle of a second American revolution.
[03:58:41.088 --> 03:58:43.792]  This time, not against King George III, but against the globalists.
[03:58:44.232 --> 03:58:48.334]  We're running a special for a week that is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[03:58:48.374 --> 03:58:50.935]  We just keep boosting the sales.
[03:58:51.315 --> 03:58:51.515]  67% off.
[03:58:51.695 --> 03:58:53.356]  Up to 67% off.
[03:58:53.436 --> 03:58:59.018]  It's defeat the Democrat slash globalist plan to censor InfoWars and the web super sale.
