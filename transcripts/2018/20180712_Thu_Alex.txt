[00:00:09.173 --> 00:00:20.321]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:22.302]  That may be, but I appeal your ruling.
[00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:26.365]  The gentleman is not recognized.
[00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:32.009]  Knowing this, will you answer the committee's question as directed, or do you refuse to answer the committee's question?
[00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:39.913]  Mr. Chairman, as you know, counsel for the FBI has directed me not to answer questions about the ongoing investigation.
[00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:43.096]  As you also know, counsel for the FBI is sitting here behind me.
[00:00:43.556 --> 00:00:44.497]  May I consult with them?
[00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.540]  You may consult with your own counsel.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.242]  But I may not consult with the FBI's counsel?
[00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:52.184]  Only with your own counsel!
[00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:56.019]  Mr. Chairman, there's no basis for that.
[00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.702]  He can consult with the FBI counsel.
[00:00:58.003 --> 00:00:58.624]  He's an FBI employee.
[00:00:58.644 --> 00:01:00.327]  The gentleman is not recognized.
[00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:02.230]  And the chairman is not being proper.
[00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:04.213]  The chairman is being proper.
[00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:07.759]  The witness can't be directed not to confer with his attorney.
[00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.131]  The FBI is not his attorney.
[00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:13.052]  His attorney is seated behind him.
[00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.314]  If he's an employee of the FBI, and he's already done, he may do so.
[00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:18.956]  And his attorney may consult with the FBI attorney?
[00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:26.501]  Isn't the privilege that of the FBI, and shouldn't the FBI counsel be solicited on that point?
[00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.122]  Just take that away right now.
[00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:30.303]  Let Trey have it.
[00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:30.763]  Let Trey have it.
[00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:31.464]  I'm ready to go.
[00:01:31.484 --> 00:01:32.484]  Let's just get this out.
[00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:34.686]  Let's just get this out, and then we'll go by Harris for Gowdy.
[00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.207]  This is the FBI attorney.
[00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:48.895]  Mr. Chairman, my counsel has reiterated that counsel for the FBI has directed that I may not answer that question.
[00:01:49.835 --> 00:02:03.884]  Mr. Strzok, in a moment we will continue with the hearing, but based on your refusal to answer the question, at the conclusion of the day we will be recessing the hearing and you will be subject to recall to allow the committee to consider proceeding with a contempt citation.
[00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:05.245]  A point of order, Mr. Chairman.
[00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:11.209]  Will the committee also consider contempt for Mr. Bannon, who refused to answer Mr. Gowdy's questions when he was actually under subpoena?
[00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:16.953]  That is not a proper point of order in this... Parliamentary inquiry... Mr. Gowdy, do you remember that?
[00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:22.416]  Parliamentary inquiry... History is happening.
[00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:24.258]  That's Congressman Goodlatte.
[00:02:25.287 --> 00:02:30.030]  And we've got dozens of fiery, explosive, historical clips coming up today.
[00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:37.496]  And we've got several people in there watching the ongoing live hearings, collating it, and we'll have a lot of it for you throughout the transmission.
[00:02:39.097 --> 00:02:46.102]  That said, we've got the big events taking place with Trump in Europe, now traveling to the UK.
[00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:52.447]  We have Stormy Daniels obviously being arrested.
[00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:58.528]  We have Dianne Feinstein fighting to even get the Democratic nomination.
[00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:06.874]  We have Democrats openly calling for Pelosi to step down, realizing that the Crypt Keeper nature of their party is not popular.
[00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:14.098]  It is quite an amazing time to be alive right now.
[00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.242]  But that said, I'm going to cover something first when we come back from break.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:51.068]  I hope everybody really pays attention to, because I know a lot of folks have learned that we're trailblazers, we've got our finger on the touchstone, the zeitgeist, but I've talked to senior people in the administration, I've talked to other folks in the campaign, I've talked to a lot of people about the concerted effort to fundamentally change the architecture of the internet and ban conservatives, nationalists, libertarians, Christians, gun owners, you name it, from access to most major platforms.
[00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:58.162]  And they're bragging how they're doing it.
[00:03:58.182 --> 00:04:01.125]  And Trump has not yet really responded to this.
[00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:04.708]  And really neither has anybody else.
[00:04:05.148 --> 00:04:11.173]  So we're tasked here at InfoWars with really blueprinting what they're doing from their own words.
[00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:12.134]  But that said,
[00:04:13.334 --> 00:04:20.158]  I printed up just the last few months of CNN saying to major publishers don't publish Alex Jones' book and successfully getting them not to publish it.
[00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.239]  Tortious interference.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:36.509]  CNN trying to get me banned off YouTube saying they're lobbying to do it and now the head of CNN's major operations has gone to a Facebook conference and called for me to be banned and they assured them that they'll start censoring us more.
[00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.092]  This is their main rollout, ladies and gentlemen, and now Sacha Baron Cohen is stalking him for as we've confirmed.
[00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:45.213]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:14.070]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:25.622]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:31.646]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.

[00:06:13.055 --> 00:06:17.096]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.317]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:19.557 --> 00:06:20.697]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:21.238 --> 00:06:25.979]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:29.000]  Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.561]  And we've definitely landed our troops in Washington.
[00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:38.463]  We are taking the Republic back, but the globalists are striking back and fighting as hard as they can.
[00:06:41.257 --> 00:06:45.319]  Well, I suspected this six months ago, but now we've confirmed it.
[00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:55.644]  Sasha Baron Cohen, we're digging out the emails right now, via Showtime, was targeting InfoWars and wanting in the building.
[00:06:57.372 --> 00:07:00.553]  And I just have a policy where I basically don't talk to mainstream media anymore.
[00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:03.854]  They're like, oh, we want to show both sides of the divide in America.
[00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:05.195]  We want to do a fair piece.
[00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:15.919]  And as soon as I saw Sarah Palin putting out the text last night that they'd sent her, the deceptive text, I went, wait, I've read those exact emails and I've heard my producer talk about them telling them that.
[00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.561]  And after about a month of them incessantly calling, I said, don't call there anymore.
[00:07:23.482 --> 00:07:24.462]  Sasha Barrett Cohen.
[00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:28.342]  The king of fake news.
[00:07:28.562 --> 00:07:43.870]  Because what they do is they act like they're comedians, but then the media puts out the late night comedy shows like Homeland, all these so-called entertainment shows from the opposition to you name it, are designed to target Infowars in their own admissions.
[00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:53.656]  And then they put it out like the things they're saying, bigoted, hateful, racist, are things we said.
[00:07:54.727 --> 00:07:59.489]  And then they have CNN come out today and call for InfoWars to be banned.
[00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:14.936]  CNN officially sent their head of media operations to Facebook and CNN Money has the headline that they're calling for me to be removed from the internet.
[00:08:16.124 --> 00:08:17.485]  They want our apps removed.
[00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:19.786]  They want us kicked off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:22.808]  They don't want us to have access to Google Store, which has already happened.
[00:08:23.008 --> 00:08:26.230]  They don't want us to have advertising to any of this.
[00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.712]  And then they misrepresent things I've said or done as the excuse.
[00:08:30.752 --> 00:08:33.774]  A few months ago, CNN said, ban him from YouTube.
[00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:35.415]  He says no one died at Parkland.
[00:08:35.455 --> 00:08:36.115]  It's all fake.
[00:08:36.435 --> 00:08:37.075]  Never said that.
[00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:38.376]  You said that.
[00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:39.677]  You are fake news.
[00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:48.931]  And look at the smiling possum grin of a possum sitting over a nice big pile of dog crap it found that it wants to eat.
[00:08:50.132 --> 00:08:56.095]  Facebook touts fight on fake news but struggles to explain why InfoWars isn't banned.
[00:08:56.815 --> 00:08:58.876]  Wow, what an American organization.
[00:09:00.077 --> 00:09:02.158]  At CNN, we love the American people.
[00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:06.720]  We don't hate the American people.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.380]  Remember Wolf Blitzer?
[00:09:12.512 --> 00:09:14.033]  So Trump calls you fake news.
[00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.455]  Does that mean you get banned?
[00:09:16.436 --> 00:09:16.596]  No.
[00:09:17.136 --> 00:09:21.160]  It means everyone tunes out and your ratings go from non-existent to negative.
[00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:29.988]  You have to force feed at hotels and restaurants and bus terminals and schools.
[00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:36.734]  When I was in high school, 27 years ago, man I'm getting old,
[00:09:39.433 --> 00:09:46.215]  27 years ago, they put in TVs when I was a sophomore in Rockwall, Texas.
[00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:49.416]  And then I moved down here the next year, and they had the TVs in there.
[00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:54.258]  In your first period, you would watch 15 minutes of CNN propaganda.
[00:09:54.938 --> 00:09:58.439]  And it was all race war, whites are bad, guns are bad.
[00:09:59.159 --> 00:09:59.900]  It was incredible.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:07.362]  And CNN paid for the entire TV system to be put into the entire school set of projectors
[00:10:08.806 --> 00:10:14.268]  In Rockwall, Texas, and then in Austin, Texas, and I learned nationwide to force-feed their garbage.
[00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:21.471]  So, they are openly saying they want to ban InfoWars.
[00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:22.731]  They're all over the news saying it.
[00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:33.155]  They have Sacha Baron Cohen stalking us, dressed up with InfoWars shirts and stickers, going around saying horrible racist things.
[00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:34.095]  That's in the news today.
[00:10:35.116 --> 00:10:38.397]  And so, in the movie, he dresses like an InfoWars listener,
[00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:41.842]  And then runs around saying racist things.
[00:10:42.923 --> 00:10:47.606]  Total defamation on a whole group of people that are pro-America and pro-free market.
[00:10:48.006 --> 00:10:49.387]  This is how they operate.
[00:10:50.828 --> 00:10:52.229]  So I'm going to be breaking this down today.
[00:10:52.249 --> 00:10:58.173]  We're going to be getting into the incredible hearings that are taking place.
[00:11:01.072 --> 00:11:06.897]  GOP lawmakers threaten FBI agent Peter Strzok with contempt for refusing to answer questions on Mueller probe.
[00:11:07.498 --> 00:11:10.761]  US Marshals serve subpoena on FBI lawyer Lisa Page.
[00:11:12.262 --> 00:11:14.024]  Congress threatens to hold her in contempt.
[00:11:16.546 --> 00:11:19.448]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, today.
[00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:24.032]  We've got them in the crosshairs, but that said,
[00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:26.267]  It's neck and neck.
[00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:29.690]  We are starting to win, but we're far from having the main victory.
[00:11:29.871 --> 00:11:36.097]  And if people don't take this very, very seriously, they've got a few aces up their sleeve.
[00:11:36.477 --> 00:11:43.965]  The globalists are going to at least bring in a total destabilization, as they're already starting to do, to try to stop America's return.
[00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.691]  So, this is a total fight.
[00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:49.671]  You see CNN trying to collapse our borders.
[00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:57.794]  You see the mainstream media and the Democrats rooting against Trump when we pay half of the NATO bill and 20-something other countries pay almost nothing.
[00:11:58.434 --> 00:12:01.015]  And they call that traitorous and bad and hurting America.
[00:12:01.295 --> 00:12:03.736]  You just see how much they hate America.
[00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:05.616]  How much they hate the American people.
[00:12:07.337 --> 00:12:13.799]  How they've been for generations, several, 60 years or so, selling out our infrastructure.
[00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:17.137]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[00:12:17.277 --> 00:12:18.838]  Sarah Palin isn't the only one.
[00:12:19.198 --> 00:12:22.318]  Dick Cheney, Bernie Sanders also got duped by Sacha Baron Cohen.
[00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:24.579]  Exclusive Breitbart.
[00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:30.320]  Sacha Baron Cohen posed as disabled veteran, front voter with bullet necklace and InfoWars stickers.
[00:12:34.101 --> 00:12:37.061]  And then meanwhile, Hillary Clinton calls for InfoWars to be banned.
[00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:39.662]  Homeland blames Alex Jones character for fake news.
[00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:41.402]  And then says things I never said.
[00:12:41.482 --> 00:12:44.063]  And then they use this in CNN articles and go, look!
[00:12:46.502 --> 00:12:47.383]  Ban InfoWars!
[00:12:47.443 --> 00:12:49.084]  Look, everybody hates him.
[00:12:49.384 --> 00:12:50.185]  No, you hate me.
[00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:53.167]  Fake news is television's favorite new storyline.
[00:12:54.328 --> 00:12:54.828]  The Atlantic.
[00:12:55.248 --> 00:12:56.329]  And then it talks about InfoWars.
[00:12:56.529 --> 00:13:04.675]  They quote things that they say I said on the TV show, on a fiction show on Showtime, and then use that as a way to quote Ban InfoWars.
[00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:06.096]  Because Homeland said it.
[00:13:06.817 --> 00:13:15.343]  And then weird Democrat voters watch this crap, dozens of shows against me, and then they believe when they see me on the street that I'm really that person.
[00:13:16.288 --> 00:13:17.089]  Talk about weak-minded.
[00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.293]  We've got all the Hillary clips calling for me to be banned, and she's still directing this.
[00:13:24.134 --> 00:13:29.538]  And it's said we've got to get fake news banned by the midterms or the Republicans will stay in power.
[00:13:29.898 --> 00:13:30.959]  We've got all the clips coming up.
[00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:34.082]  And then they're directly attacking InfoWars as the case point.
[00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:39.426]  They've got all these fake TV shows attacking me with fake news.
[00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:48.130]  And then saying, I need to be removed because I'm fake news, so I can't, and this is the key, defend myself while they demonize and attack me.
[00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:53.194]  Here it is, CNN lobbies Facebook to shut down InfoWars, the new story today.
[00:13:53.914 --> 00:14:00.559]  And they're at the conference openly saying, it isn't enough to shadow ban them or block their articles, we want it totally banned.
[00:14:02.998 --> 00:14:10.184]  Because Jones says Trump is getting ready to come out and go public and expose Mueller for the 9-11 cover-up.
[00:14:10.564 --> 00:14:11.705]  Trump's already done that!
[00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:13.287]  His people have already done it!
[00:14:13.827 --> 00:14:16.009]  And that's a real source as well!
[00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.950]  Just wait and watch!
[00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.512]  No, they know I'm real news.
[00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:20.633]  That's why they're scared.
[00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:23.415]  But they lied about WMDs.
[00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:27.178]  They lied about the Martin Luther King bust being taken out of the White House.
[00:14:27.218 --> 00:14:27.879]  They lied about
[00:14:28.581 --> 00:14:30.904]  Trump not visiting Scalise in the hospital.
[00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:32.265]  They're known liars.
[00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:37.812]  So if you've been caught making a mistake, taken off the air, they've been caught lying.
[00:14:39.594 --> 00:14:41.556]  So many times you can't even keep track of it.
[00:14:42.918 --> 00:14:46.923]  Facebook touts fight on fake news but struggles to explain why Infowars isn't banned.
[00:14:47.223 --> 00:14:48.424]  CNN today.
[00:14:49.332 --> 00:14:56.729]  And you've got one of the heads of CNN, this is CNN officially, lobbying for another news organization to be shut down.
[00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.052]  You talk about authoritarian.
[00:14:58.213 --> 00:14:59.395]  Hey, here's how you counter it.
[00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:05.480]  We've got, for Apple and for Android, an amazing new free app.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.721]  It's InfoWars Official.

[00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:10.122]  It's InfoWars Official.

[00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:29.587]  You're gonna use this.
[00:15:30.547 --> 00:15:31.607]  Tell everybody you know about it.
[00:15:31.927 --> 00:15:33.128]  This is the forbidden info.
[00:15:33.388 --> 00:15:34.808]  This is the guy they don't want you to hear.
[00:15:35.048 --> 00:15:37.049]  This is the guy they're demonizing everywhere.
[00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:42.690]  Obviously, you want to then go find out what it is they're so scared of.
[00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.470]  It's free right now.
[00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:48.471]  We'll be right back on the other side of this break.
[00:15:48.851 --> 00:15:50.712]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:16:03.215 --> 00:16:04.595]  They think you're a goldfish!
[00:16:06.197 --> 00:16:08.298]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[00:16:08.558 --> 00:16:09.639]  I believe in you!
[00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:16.403]  I don't think you're stupid!
[00:16:16.603 --> 00:16:20.466]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:21.807]  And we're not backing down on her!
[00:16:23.088 --> 00:16:24.669]  I wanna get these people!
[00:16:24.689 --> 00:16:25.429]  We're winning!
[00:16:25.489 --> 00:16:26.590]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.211]  Can't you?
[00:16:27.511 --> 00:16:29.132]  We have broken their back!
[00:16:29.492 --> 00:16:30.613]  Yes, I can feel it!
[00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:34.771]  Let's go!

[00:17:00.672 --> 00:17:03.874]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:05.634]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:17:06.115 --> 00:17:17.640]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:17:18.341 --> 00:17:27.205]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:33.489]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:17:33.729 --> 00:17:38.372]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.194]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:42.895]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:17:43.275 --> 00:17:52.901]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:17:53.001 --> 00:17:55.123]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[00:17:55.663 --> 00:18:00.545]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:03.306]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:18:03.706 --> 00:18:08.848]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:12.390]  This is the essence of Infowars.
[00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.394]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:18:17.015 --> 00:18:28.287]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:18:28.928 --> 00:18:39.670]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:45.411]  You can support us by going to the InfoWar store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[00:18:45.731 --> 00:18:48.992]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.
[00:18:49.532 --> 00:18:50.972]  It's a 360 win.
[00:18:51.352 --> 00:18:54.453]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle,
[00:18:54.853 --> 00:18:56.635]  You're helping the fight for freedom.
[00:18:56.915 --> 00:18:58.297]  So please go to the site now.
[00:18:58.718 --> 00:19:00.359]  We need your support.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.722]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:03.183]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.483 --> 00:19:05.645]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:05.665 --> 00:19:08.709]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:10.651]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:10.971 --> 00:19:12.633]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:13.374 --> 00:19:15.436]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:19.681]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:22.223]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:23.024 --> 00:19:25.327]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:25.687 --> 00:19:26.808]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:27.048 --> 00:19:27.949]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.211]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:30.671]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:31.792]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:19:31.812 --> 00:19:32.632]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:32.912 --> 00:19:38.273]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:38.593 --> 00:19:42.854]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:43.094 --> 00:19:45.955]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:46.615]  You understand?
[00:19:46.695 --> 00:19:47.975]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:48.336 --> 00:19:49.496]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:55.377]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:19:56.357 --> 00:19:57.038]  Do you understand?
[00:19:57.058 --> 00:19:58.238]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:07.507]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:12.652 --> 00:20:15.254]  You gave me fortune!
[00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:16.836]  You gave me fame!
[00:20:16.896 --> 00:20:18.798]  You gave me power!
[00:20:18.858 --> 00:20:21.821]  Give me your God's name!
[00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:26.625]  I'm every person you need to be!
[00:20:41.921 --> 00:20:42.841]  The 12th day of July 2018.
[00:20:43.521 --> 00:21:01.386]  Imagine if you'd have read or heard 10 years ago that in 2018 Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party in congressional hearings on television would be calling for conservative and libertarian nationalist and Christian news to be banned.
[00:21:02.306 --> 00:21:05.567]  And that mainline Christian country singers
[00:21:06.829 --> 00:21:18.981]  Just singing about Jesus, this happened last week, we covered it, would be banned from advertising on Facebook because they were told it was political to say Jesus.
[00:21:20.683 --> 00:21:28.972]  Or that Google and Apple would remove Easter off of their list of holidays on their official calendars
[00:21:30.828 --> 00:21:36.111]  That are on your iPhones and Androids, but have all the Islamic holidays show up.
[00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:38.852]  It's all about rubbing your nose in it.
[00:21:39.313 --> 00:21:40.693]  They hate flyover country.
[00:21:41.094 --> 00:21:42.234]  They hate America.
[00:21:44.215 --> 00:21:59.584]  And then imagine, if I told you ten years ago that they would have late night comedy every night, and two or three shows on Comedy Central, and two shows on HBO, and two shows on Showtime.
[00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:07.143]  Modeled after Alex Jones, where they then misrepresent what I say and do to demonize me.
[00:22:07.883 --> 00:22:15.245]  Remember, a year and a half ago, Chris Carter came out and said, Alex Jones isn't a racist, he's a libertarian.
[00:22:15.925 --> 00:22:20.126]  And I've created a character that's positive based on him for the show.
[00:22:22.566 --> 00:22:24.027]  And what was Chris Carter saying right there?
[00:22:24.949 --> 00:22:25.649]  He's in Hollywood.
[00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.751]  He knew the hit orders had gone out and he wasn't going along with it.
[00:22:29.052 --> 00:22:31.673]  Well, all the other shows did but Chris Carter.
[00:22:32.834 --> 00:22:38.478]  Everybody else demonized who I am and lied about me except Chris Carter and Matt Drudge.
[00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:48.824]  Everybody else is afraid to be associated with us because we hit the barbed wire, we tell the tough stories, we tell the truth.
[00:22:49.145 --> 00:22:52.507]  So the enemy then misrepresents
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:05.663]  Misrepresents who we are, and they even admit in Atlantic Monthly, TV's favorite storyline, from cop shows to you name it, so many I can't even keep track, is fake news.
[00:23:06.404 --> 00:23:07.724]  And then who do they define as fake news?
[00:23:07.744 --> 00:23:08.124]  There it is.
[00:23:08.544 --> 00:23:09.445]  Alex Jones.
[00:23:10.345 --> 00:23:11.185]  Infowars.
[00:23:13.886 --> 00:23:17.567]  And then they misrepresent what we've said and done, so people hate me.
[00:23:17.987 --> 00:23:23.389]  Weak-minded people that think dramas and comedy shows are real.
[00:23:25.455 --> 00:23:30.836]  They have a whole show, the opposition they just cancelled because of low ratings, based on misrepresenting what we say and do.
[00:23:33.257 --> 00:23:40.919]  They steal your identity, they lie about you, and then they have congressional hearings saying shut down InfoWars everywhere.
[00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:54.962]  They have congressional hearings, I have all the articles right here, they unleash Sacha Baron Cohen, dressed up in InfoWars t-shirts and InfoWars stickers,
[00:23:58.442 --> 00:24:05.468]  To run around the country saying the most racist, homophobic, hateful things attributed to me!
[00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:09.852]  Defamation on its face, but protected because I'm a public figure.
[00:24:10.272 --> 00:24:22.663]  Then, they file a bunch of fake lawsuits misrepresenting what I've said, to put out twisted and false statements against me, to then use the lawsuits as prima facie evidence that I should be taken off every internet platform.
[00:24:25.805 --> 00:24:26.586]  That's how they're doing it.
[00:24:27.588 --> 00:24:28.648]  Look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:24:28.688 --> 00:24:30.469]  It's got the article right there.
[00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:42.112]  Sasha Baron Cohen poses disabled veteran, Trump voter with bullet necklace and InfoWars stickers in Palin prank.
[00:24:43.593 --> 00:24:52.456]  I confirmed a month ago from one of our military sources, who's a real military officer, real background, that they had been approached by Sasha Baron Cohen.
[00:24:53.776 --> 00:24:56.517]  And I guess they thought they could work with him and found out they were set up.
[00:24:58.247 --> 00:24:59.228]  They couldn't get in the building.
[00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:08.897]  And six months ago, we got the emails, oh Showtime, we're your friend, we want to show both sides, we want to be fair.
[00:25:08.917 --> 00:25:18.907]  I looked right at the producer, Nico, and I said, Nico, this will be some comedy hit piece show.
[00:25:19.387 --> 00:25:22.410]  I wasn't thinking Sacha Baron Cohen, but that's exactly what it is.
[00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.871]  Imagine
[00:25:24.835 --> 00:25:44.782]  Making fun of brain damaged and disabled veterans, and then they went out, I guess, to a military hospital, where people are listed as having brain disorders from being in explosions, and then tried to have veterans reach out to us.
[00:25:44.882 --> 00:25:50.504]  So, I'm just now deciphering all of this, but let me tell you, it's sick.
[00:25:51.724 --> 00:25:52.485]  Who is America?
[00:25:54.062 --> 00:25:59.203]  And it all clicked last night that I remember one of our sources told us Cohen was after me a month ago.
[00:26:01.724 --> 00:26:04.404]  And then I was reading what Palin put out in her text messages.
[00:26:04.444 --> 00:26:13.546]  She sent screenshots of how they lied to her and how they said it was about both sides of America and bringing America together and just seeing what both sides are really saying.
[00:26:14.026 --> 00:26:16.027]  I was like, whoa, that's exactly what they told us.
[00:26:16.067 --> 00:26:16.887]  And I'm like, boom.
[00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:20.793]  And I walk in this morning and they go, what, you haven't read Drudge Report?
[00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:23.775]  I said, yeah, I did look at it, but no, InfoWars.
[00:26:24.996 --> 00:26:28.559]  He's dressed up in InfoWars outfits, which is exactly what I was told.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.003]  And I'm going to go ahead and start spilling the beans.
[00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:37.866]  It looks like he was able to try to infiltrate Kanye West, too.
[00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.612]  Other targets of the globalist, Elon Musk.
[00:26:49.622 --> 00:26:52.424]  Sacha Baron Cohen is some type of intelligence operative.
[00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:53.065]  There's no doubt.
[00:26:53.085 --> 00:26:54.006]  This isn't a comedian.
[00:26:54.926 --> 00:26:55.927]  This is a saboteur.
[00:27:01.312 --> 00:27:04.975]  And now Sarah Silverman's reaching out to a Trump supporter saying, I love you.
[00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:07.479]  And that's all they can do is pure deception.
[00:27:07.499 --> 00:27:17.441]  And then Sarah Palin said they changed her flights that they'd paid for, to fly her out for the interview, to drop her in the middle of nowhere with no connecting flights for a day, just as an act of evil.
[00:27:17.661 --> 00:27:19.362]  Because this is all military attacks.
[00:27:19.382 --> 00:27:22.462]  Let me tell you something, you can't talk to leftists, you can't let them in your building.
[00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:30.384]  Der Spiegel begged to be in here, all this other stuff, and I was the last people I let in, and I got barbecued for them.
[00:27:31.417 --> 00:27:33.559]  And I said, would you like some brisket, like some sausage?
[00:27:33.599 --> 00:27:34.359]  And the guy laughed.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.303]  And then he said in the newspaper that I said, you want to suck my sausage.
[00:27:39.063 --> 00:27:42.906]  That's Der Spiegel, formerly the most respected publication in Deutschland.
[00:27:43.707 --> 00:27:46.429]  Total lie, total fraud, total scam.
[00:27:46.709 --> 00:27:48.291]  These people will do anything.
[00:27:48.551 --> 00:27:53.375]  They have been authorized by their big corporations to push it to the wall.
[00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:06.114]  So that's what they do over and over and over again, and they're preying on you.
[00:28:06.915 --> 00:28:12.698]  So they have entertainment shows and all the rest of them sitting there misrepresenting who we are.
[00:28:12.958 --> 00:28:14.119]  Then they file fake lawsuits.
[00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:15.920]  Then they go to Congress and call for censorship.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.382]  Then they have the big tech companies shadow ban everybody.
[00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:21.023]  And then once the precedent's set, they do it to everyone.
[00:28:21.984 --> 00:28:26.907]  And that's in the news with CNN, the London Guardian, all of them today.
[00:28:29.156 --> 00:28:32.138]  Saying we want Alex Jones banned.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:40.825]  That's on InfoWars.com right now with a direct link of one of the major heads of operations at CNN lobbying to have us banned.
[00:28:40.845 --> 00:28:43.947]  They said, sir, we already censored him down to nothing.
[00:28:44.968 --> 00:28:45.729]  They said, that's not enough.
[00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:46.970]  We want him banned completely.
[00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:48.070]  Isn't that dangerous?
[00:29:00.993 --> 00:29:06.537]  I'm telling you, every day I am shocked at how the left is becoming more and more unhinged.
[00:29:07.117 --> 00:29:11.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:11.780]  USA!
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.160]  USA!
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.682]  We're getting ready to go on the march.
[00:29:14.702 --> 00:29:14.982]  USA!
[00:29:15.122 --> 00:29:15.623]  USA!
[00:29:15.903 --> 00:29:17.604]  We're going to march past Antifa.
[00:29:17.624 --> 00:29:17.864]  USA!
[00:29:18.044 --> 00:29:18.204]  USA!
[00:29:18.525 --> 00:29:20.766]  They're on both sides of the street.
[00:29:21.166 --> 00:29:21.387]  USA!
[00:29:21.547 --> 00:29:22.047]  USA!
[00:29:22.247 --> 00:29:24.108]  It's probably going to get hot and heavy.
[00:29:24.168 --> 00:29:26.610]  Portland was absolutely crazy.
[00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:27.711]  We were at the park.
[00:29:28.371 --> 00:29:36.535]  Peacefully having a rally, decided to go on the march, and the Portland police, they seemed like they knew our path.
[00:29:37.035 --> 00:29:43.177]  They left a wide street, wide open, for antifa to come down to deliberately attack us.
[00:29:43.638 --> 00:29:44.978]  And the police saw them coming.
[00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:47.719]  They did nothing about it until it was just too late.
[00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.120]  People were fighting with each other.
[00:29:50.063 --> 00:29:56.045]  Anti-fascists pelting eggs, water bottles, and even firecrackers at the Patriot Prayers Group.
[00:29:56.105 --> 00:30:00.966]  Portland police making several arrests and seizing knives, pepper spray, and clubs.
[00:30:01.146 --> 00:30:02.507]  We're peacefully marching.
[00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:08.289]  And not a single time did we go up to Antifa and try to hit them or any of that.
[00:30:08.829 --> 00:30:12.650]  It was when Antifa came at us trying to hit us with pipes, rocks.
[00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.351]  They were throwing these little explosives.
[00:30:15.991 --> 00:30:17.152]  Well, what you just said
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.861]  This is so brilliant.
[00:30:36.981 --> 00:30:37.601]  Oh my gosh.
[00:30:37.801 --> 00:30:39.262]  This needs to get to Trump's desk.
[00:30:39.903 --> 00:30:43.045]  The Democrat Party is now a terrorist organization.
[00:30:43.505 --> 00:30:44.706]  We have the video clips.
[00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:48.268]  You have the undercover video of Aaron Black saying we're starting riots.
[00:30:48.328 --> 00:30:48.889]  We're proud of it.
[00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:51.110]  You got Maxine Waters calling for violence.
[00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:52.411]  Harassed people in the streets.
[00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:54.292]  Antifa going out, hitting people with bikes.
[00:30:54.332 --> 00:30:57.815]  I mean, the Democrat Party is now a domestic terror group.
[00:30:58.035 --> 00:30:58.415]  That is it.
[00:30:58.435 --> 00:31:00.196]  Nobody's really supposed to know about this.
[00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:06.098]  The Chicago protest on the shuttle, that was us.
[00:31:06.238 --> 00:31:10.059]  It was more him than me, but none of this is supposed to come back to us.
[00:31:10.079 --> 00:31:19.401]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, in a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:23.302]  And you push back on them!
[00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:27.363]  And you tell them they're not welcome!
[00:31:34.243 --> 00:31:39.307]  Enough is enough.
[00:31:39.347 --> 00:31:43.670]  This country is on the verge, and I truly believe that we are in a civil war right now.
[00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:53.997]  It's a cold civil war, but because you have mad 19-year-olds, who I like to call it, and then you have Nancy Pelosi and the rest of them, they are pushing for a hot civil war, but they don't want to be the ones to do it.
[00:31:54.297 --> 00:31:58.060]  They want to push their foot soldiers to do it, and people, BLM, and BAM.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.642]  And now you got the Brown Berets here in California.
[00:32:01.082 --> 00:32:02.483]  We've got to change things.
[00:32:02.803 --> 00:32:04.024]  We've got to change the people.
[00:32:04.044 --> 00:32:04.945]  We've got to wake up.
[00:32:05.005 --> 00:32:07.046]  They want to have a blue wave.
[00:32:07.606 --> 00:32:11.149]  We need to have a red tsunami come over and just completely wipe them out.
[00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:17.073]  I want to crush the Democratic Party because they are doing no good for the American people.
[00:33:04.809 --> 00:33:07.491]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:27.935]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:29.917]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.338 --> 00:33:38.525]  So, there's Showtime shows, there's HBO shows, there's Comedy Central shows, all misrepresenting who I am and what InfoWars does.
[00:33:39.066 --> 00:33:40.067]  Oh, we're not important at all.
[00:33:41.528 --> 00:33:44.731]  Then they've got every major news program in the country doing hit pieces.
[00:33:44.831 --> 00:33:45.372]  Nightline.
[00:33:48.539 --> 00:34:04.825]  Dateline NBC, the CNN programs, MSNBC, every day misrepresenting Fox News when Megyn Kelly was there editing tapes of me talking about Hillary being personally responsible for tens of thousands of dead children via the Arab Spring.
[00:34:06.406 --> 00:34:10.187]  And then saying I said kids are being killed in a pizza parlor.
[00:34:12.577 --> 00:34:18.681]  That's how they covered up what was really going on with the Podesta brothers and the emails and the Aleister Crowley crap that was in the wedgie leaks.
[00:34:18.701 --> 00:34:32.491]  They just created a fake story, put it on us, and then used their fake story to call for us to be banned before we've ever been found liable or defamatory in court.
[00:34:34.412 --> 00:34:41.557]  Total authoritarians with a coordinated demonization program of Trump, Infowars, and others.
[00:34:43.755 --> 00:34:46.876]  And now CNN officially calls for InfoWars to be banned.
[00:34:47.276 --> 00:34:48.956]  I've got a lot of other news I want to cover here.
[00:34:48.976 --> 00:34:58.339]  We have a special guest, Murray Grathwald's daughter, who was out at the prayer vigil in San Francisco and got viciously attacked by Antifa.
[00:34:58.519 --> 00:35:07.661]  You're talking about three women, three or four men, going out there just to have a prayer vigil in San Francisco and to pray for peace.
[00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:10.501]  Looks like about 16, 17 men show up.
[00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:18.018]  With one woman to try to beat him up and they couldn't even get it done and got run off.
[00:35:19.239 --> 00:35:22.161]  And the images of them punching women in the face.
[00:35:23.262 --> 00:35:24.923]  Scum of the earth.
[00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:28.566]  She'll be joining us the second half of the next hour.
[00:35:28.586 --> 00:35:31.087]  I intend to open the phones up as well.
[00:35:31.107 --> 00:35:33.929]  I want to cover a lot of news, but let me tell you something right now.
[00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:41.054]  There is nothing bigger out there than the fact that
[00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:44.808]  I can't even watch Netflix.
[00:35:45.328 --> 00:35:49.151]  I mean, I don't care what show it is or what movie now.
[00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:51.412]  It's got propaganda in it.
[00:35:51.432 --> 00:36:12.607]  I mean, I remember reading 30 years ago about the lost city of Z in South America and how they knew they'd found pyramids all over Central America and they'd also found them in Peru.
[00:36:14.685 --> 00:36:17.327]  So, British explorers went there to discover them.
[00:36:17.347 --> 00:36:21.610]  I mean, they found pyramids all over the world.
[00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.752]  They believed there were super civilizations.
[00:36:25.132 --> 00:36:27.494]  They believed Atlantis might be in South America.
[00:36:29.275 --> 00:36:30.076]  The British explorer.
[00:36:30.876 --> 00:36:35.019]  So I see it on... Netflix.
[00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:36.720]  Been out for a couple years.
[00:36:37.281 --> 00:36:38.581]  And I think, let me watch this movie.
[00:36:39.742 --> 00:36:41.964]  And there's all these crazy, stupid white people.
[00:36:43.922 --> 00:36:50.386]  And they go there, and the British Academy of Science says, Savages can't build pyramids.
[00:36:50.466 --> 00:36:52.447]  There are no pyramids in the Americas.
[00:36:52.927 --> 00:36:54.388]  They are all evil and dumb.
[00:36:54.568 --> 00:36:55.869]  And I'm going, what do you mean?
[00:36:55.889 --> 00:36:58.750]  They'd already found a bunch of them, and they thought Atlantis was there.
[00:37:00.411 --> 00:37:03.533]  They thought they'd find, you know, super palaces of gold and all this stuff.
[00:37:03.733 --> 00:37:04.694]  They thought the opposite.
[00:37:06.135 --> 00:37:07.195]  So I know the history.
[00:37:11.558 --> 00:37:11.878]  And then,
[00:37:13.527 --> 00:37:17.628]  The whole thing is about how one guy's not racist and believes brown people can build things.
[00:37:19.009 --> 00:37:22.350]  And that's just one example of everything's a lie now!
[00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:29.912]  You think you're going to see a historical movie, and it's not just a little twisted, it's like a barrel of snakes, man!
[00:37:33.773 --> 00:37:36.314]  And, I mean, there's hundreds of movies about
[00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:40.297]  Black sports stars that had to go through racism to win.
[00:37:40.897 --> 00:37:43.639]  Hundreds the last few years in daytime TV shows and everything.
[00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:52.004]  You can't even go to the movies and like find something that isn't like this and it's all a giant agenda to make us hate each other.
[00:37:52.384 --> 00:37:53.504]  It's insane!
[00:37:57.987 --> 00:38:02.630]  Like somebody in 1920 didn't believe there were pyramids in South America.
[00:38:04.175 --> 00:38:07.116]  Pyramids have been found in South America 500 years before!
[00:38:11.617 --> 00:38:18.259]  But again, this is what they do to people that don't know any history.
[00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:20.220]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.421]  My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:38:22.481 --> 00:38:23.441]  This is how they prey on you.
[00:38:23.781 --> 00:38:26.702]  Hollywood is completely sold out to the Communist Chinese.
[00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.630]  Michael Savage put a book out about that a few years ago.
[00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:35.731]  The publishers wouldn't even deliver it once they got threatened, because they didn't realize it until the book was about to come out.
[00:38:36.111 --> 00:38:37.252]  Then the Chai-coms got involved.
[00:38:37.292 --> 00:38:38.652]  They wouldn't deliver it to stores.
[00:38:39.152 --> 00:38:50.454]  I've now learned that I'm banned off big podcasts and things out there, because people have been told that the Chinese communists basically control the industry they're involved, so you can't have Alex Jones on.
[00:38:50.674 --> 00:38:51.834]  Hell, I forgot this.
[00:38:51.854 --> 00:38:52.835]  Will you guys pull this for me?
[00:38:52.855 --> 00:38:54.195]  It was mainstream news yesterday.
[00:38:55.353 --> 00:39:04.899]  Apple products will not let you send, until yesterday, the emoji, the image, of the Taiwanese flag.
[00:39:05.379 --> 00:39:06.900]  It makes your phone crash.
[00:39:08.701 --> 00:39:18.587]  Remember 12 years ago, John McCain said, if you hack anybody or you download illegal music, we will fry your computer.
[00:39:18.647 --> 00:39:20.489]  We will crash it or maybe even fry it.
[00:39:20.769 --> 00:39:21.629]  People said that's outrageous.
[00:39:21.649 --> 00:39:22.590]  They already had that technology.
[00:39:24.139 --> 00:39:28.740]  Apple's China-friendly censorship caused an iPhone crashing bug.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.160]  Wired.
[00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:37.703]  And it goes on that if you try to send the Taiwanese flag, your iPhone crashes.
[00:39:37.723 --> 00:39:39.363]  Well, what happened five months ago?
[00:39:39.683 --> 00:39:46.865]  Apple officially moved to China to be tax-exempt, merged with the government, and they told Reuters, in China, if you are based here, the government runs you.
[00:39:47.206 --> 00:39:48.186]  That's just the way it is.
[00:39:48.526 --> 00:39:49.146]  And boom!
[00:39:49.486 --> 00:39:51.867]  If they can censor a flag in real time,
[00:39:52.992 --> 00:39:55.975]  They can do a voice print and ban Alex Jones or President Trump.
[00:39:56.275 --> 00:40:00.559]  They can ban words, just like you try to type on your iPhone a cuss word, it won't let you do it.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.800]  It's beyond that.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.401]  It's here.
[00:40:02.641 --> 00:40:16.214]  And that's the new Article 13, Article 11 the EU's been trying to pass, saying that software by law will be on all devices where you cannot even say or do certain things preemptively.
[00:40:19.093 --> 00:40:21.835]  Now, this was such a big blow-up for Apple, they had to back off.
[00:40:22.095 --> 00:40:23.136]  They said, we apologize.
[00:40:23.496 --> 00:40:26.179]  We'll only geolocate if you're inside China.
[00:40:28.741 --> 00:40:29.561]  Let that sink in!
[00:40:30.282 --> 00:40:34.785]  You've got all these Hollywood programs saying I'm a racist and misrepresenting who I am, defaming me.
[00:40:36.186 --> 00:40:44.513]  You've got the very same corporations calling for me to be shut down so they can lie about me and you, and we don't have a way to speak out or resist it, and even counter it.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.161]  We have them suing us trying to shut us down.
[00:40:48.181 --> 00:40:52.683]  They're trying to shadow ban and block the president, which they're doing on Twitter with his push notifications.
[00:40:54.904 --> 00:41:05.130]  Apple and others have moved to China and are now putting the iCloud data keys to everyone's iPhone on their platform and admitting that Chinese intelligence now runs Apple.
[00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.291]  Most of the universities are run by the Chai Coms.
[00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:08.471]  Hollywood's owned by it.
[00:41:08.832 --> 00:41:10.392]  The UFC's being bought up by it.
[00:41:10.833 --> 00:41:11.233]  Everything.
[00:41:12.486 --> 00:41:19.491]  And I'm just a loyal American sitting here saying it's wrong for an American citizen not to be able to send the Taiwanese flag to somebody.
[00:41:20.191 --> 00:41:25.035]  Because the Chai comms that have killed over 100 million of their own people and sell Christians organs.
[00:41:25.635 --> 00:41:27.376]  Because they're Christians on the world market.
[00:41:27.596 --> 00:41:31.019]  What, tell me a 30-year-old Christian doesn't have a heartbeat or a soul next?
[00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:31.439]  Liberals?
[00:41:31.759 --> 00:41:32.560]  You're not liberals!
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:38.324]  You are weak followers that sold out to every form of evil and didn't even get a payoff to do it!
[00:41:39.582 --> 00:41:42.223]  You like to watch mainstream news and feel like you're on the winning team.
[00:41:42.243 --> 00:41:43.864]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:41:43.884 --> 00:41:48.085]  I'm not here trying to just get along, to go along, or go along to get along.
[00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:49.465]  I'm here to fight the globalists.
[00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:50.766]  I'm here to hit the barbed wire.
[00:41:50.826 --> 00:41:51.806]  I'm here to expose them.
[00:41:52.086 --> 00:41:54.567]  I'm here to never stop, never back down, and win.
[00:41:54.927 --> 00:41:58.029]  And thank God Trump's going to Europe and saying, we pay half of NATO.
[00:41:58.049 --> 00:41:58.689]  That's not fair.
[00:41:58.889 --> 00:41:59.509]  Pay a little more.
[00:41:59.789 --> 00:42:02.170]  Hey, China, you got a $900 billion deficit on us.
[00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.270]  Give us $50 billion.
[00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.031]  They said no.
[00:42:04.231 --> 00:42:04.971]  He goes $250, $500 billion.
[00:42:04.991 --> 00:42:05.171]  Let's go!
[00:42:08.032 --> 00:42:09.873]  The days of everybody laying down are over.
[00:42:10.433 --> 00:42:13.215]  And all you traitors saying the President's a traitor, you're the traitor.
[00:42:14.856 --> 00:42:15.576]  And you're going to lose.
[00:42:15.716 --> 00:42:20.019]  Now don't forget, we've launched, while it's still available, and let them censor it.
[00:42:20.039 --> 00:42:21.499]  That's just another victory to show who they are.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.661]  On iPhone and Android.
[00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:27.563]  Android, the official InfoWars app.
[00:42:27.643 --> 00:42:28.183]  Works great.
[00:42:28.263 --> 00:42:29.163]  Live video streaming.
[00:42:29.424 --> 00:42:30.524]  Push notifications.
[00:42:31.585 --> 00:42:32.565]  Listen without watching.
[00:42:33.066 --> 00:42:33.806]  Turn the video off.
[00:42:35.247 --> 00:42:35.667]  Everything.

[00:42:47.328 --> 00:42:50.812]  Tomorrow's news today, the cutting edge of the return of America.
[00:42:51.333 --> 00:42:53.855]  Straight ahead, we delve in to so much more.
[00:42:53.875 --> 00:42:56.458]  The live hearings in Congress and the return of the Republic.
[00:42:56.478 --> 00:42:56.919]  Straight ahead.
[00:43:08.929 --> 00:43:09.910]  Dr. Shiva's our guest.
[00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:11.571]  Great guy running for Senate.
[00:43:11.891 --> 00:43:12.772]  Got a shot at winning.
[00:43:12.812 --> 00:43:15.313]  And Elizabeth Warren, really a smart engineer.
[00:43:15.573 --> 00:43:16.614]  Very successful businessman.
[00:43:16.934 --> 00:43:17.695]  Inventor of email.
[00:43:17.735 --> 00:43:18.095]  Look it up.
[00:43:18.175 --> 00:43:18.635]  It's true.
[00:43:18.815 --> 00:43:28.081]  And he is running against Elizabeth Warren, who will not do the genetic test, who the tribes say she has no connection to in Oklahoma or other areas.
[00:43:28.141 --> 00:43:31.123]  But he's a real Indian from the subcontinent, India.
[00:43:31.163 --> 00:43:32.024]  But he's a great patriot.
[00:43:32.044 --> 00:43:32.905]  I'd love to get him in the U.S.
[00:43:32.945 --> 00:43:33.225]  Senate.
[00:43:33.265 --> 00:43:38.028]  Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, thanks for joining us with some big, breaking, exclusive news.
[00:43:38.268 --> 00:43:42.710]  You know, we got this big sign out here, you may have seen it, you know, only the real Indian can defeat the fake Indian.
[00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:59.239]  It's a very powerful meme, Alex, and I want to really explain why it's so powerful and why we put it out there, because it really is an expression of not only my anger, but pretty much everyone's anger at the corruption that is taking place in government, and Elizabeth Warren is a face of that corruption.
[00:43:59.259 --> 00:44:07.163]  So when we put that signage up on our bus, the city of Cambridge, which is supposed to be the most liberal haven on the planet, said we had to take it down
[00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:10.144]  That was on April 5th, 2018.
[00:44:10.184 --> 00:44:10.865]  We didn't do that.
[00:44:10.905 --> 00:44:15.487]  In fact, we retaliated hard and we sued them, took them to federal court, and we won.
[00:44:15.867 --> 00:44:22.991]  They surrendered completely, and then based on that, we dismissed the court case.
[00:44:23.051 --> 00:44:26.013]  Obviously, the mainstream media did not want to cover our victory.
[00:44:26.553 --> 00:44:31.575]  So what we realize, Alex, the big news is this, and this is something that's really, really important.
[00:44:31.595 --> 00:44:36.258]  You see, for far too long, the establishment has made politics
[00:44:36.758 --> 00:44:37.538]  We're good to go.
[00:44:56.323 --> 00:45:05.249]  And what we realized was people say, you know what, you guys have a lot of courage to put that out there because you're bringing out something in Massachusetts that people do not want to talk about.
[00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:07.590]  It's a weaponized way of getting across our message.
[00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:11.733]  So what we've done is, if you see these magnetic signs here, they're really easy.
[00:45:12.093 --> 00:45:15.795]  So we want to replicate this all over the state, Alex.
[00:45:15.855 --> 00:45:16.876]  In fact, all over the country.
[00:45:17.436 --> 00:45:36.902]  And basically people can buy these magnetic signs you can see as you're showing being put on and where since we launched we have you know tons of people starting to write and wanting these and why is that and the reality is when Elizabeth Warren it's not about identity right the liberals want to convert it to a race issue but it's nothing to do with race it has to do with
[00:45:37.262 --> 00:45:38.003]  With integrity.
[00:45:38.063 --> 00:45:41.566]  We're talking about someone who did not work hard, who cut in line.
[00:45:41.907 --> 00:45:45.890]  You, me, Alex, and pretty much every American watching your show works for a living.
[00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.752]  You know, I mowed lawns as a kid.
[00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:51.936]  You know, learned to engineer software as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid.
[00:45:51.956 --> 00:45:53.477]  I've been working all my life.
[00:45:53.777 --> 00:45:57.121]  But Elizabeth Warren cut in front of line, and they do not want to discuss that.
[00:45:57.181 --> 00:46:02.746]  So we are bringing up not just a race issue, because for far too long, down the street is Harvard University.
[00:46:03.266 --> 00:46:10.849]  The white liberal racists who want us to keep us all on their reservation and plantation have bounded the discussion of race, Alex.
[00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:12.170]  And they don't know what to do with us.
[00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.451]  Because when we bring up that sign, they'll say, oh, that's racist.
[00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:16.232]  We'll say, really?
[00:46:16.612 --> 00:46:23.595]  And we'll flip it back and we say, look, you're the racist because you're supporting a woman who took advantage of race to get in and when she's not of that race.
[00:46:23.935 --> 00:46:28.137]  How do folks, even though they're not in Massachusetts, how do they get one of these babies?
[00:46:28.337 --> 00:46:28.897]  It's very easy.
[00:46:28.917 --> 00:46:30.659]  You just go to shiva4senate.com.
[00:46:30.899 --> 00:46:31.879]  You can find it right there.
[00:46:31.899 --> 00:46:33.280]  It's called a Road Warrior Kit.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.081]  Go to the store.
[00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:35.622]  Get the Road Warrior Kit.
[00:46:35.642 --> 00:46:36.142]  We've made it.
[00:46:36.402 --> 00:46:37.663]  You get two magnetic stickers.
[00:46:37.683 --> 00:46:38.504]  You get a lawn sign.
[00:46:38.524 --> 00:46:39.565]  You get two bumper stickers.
[00:46:39.805 --> 00:46:40.465]  Oh my god.
[00:46:40.485 --> 00:46:42.507]  You gotta call this Operation Road Warrior.
[00:46:42.527 --> 00:46:43.267]  Is that what you're calling it?
[00:46:43.287 --> 00:46:43.847]  That's what I call it.
[00:46:43.907 --> 00:46:44.988]  It's called Road Warrior.
[00:46:45.228 --> 00:46:46.309]  Be a Road Warrior.
[00:46:46.569 --> 00:46:47.750]  That's getting back.
[00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:51.893]  So if you can't come to and pass out cards, you can't do anything.
[00:46:51.913 --> 00:46:52.713]  You know, you got family.
[00:46:52.933 --> 00:46:54.495]  Hey, I'm fully supporting this.
[00:46:54.895 --> 00:46:55.875]  But I am stealing the idea.
[00:46:55.895 --> 00:46:57.797]  We're gonna launch Operation Road Warrior with our stuff too.
[00:47:04.381 --> 00:47:10.665]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.968 --> 00:47:19.430]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:47:20.031 --> 00:47:21.532]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:37.846]  So why do all the major universities that are state-funded, bad-mouth America, call for race war, put down capitalism?
[00:47:38.826 --> 00:47:39.427]  Because the U.S.
[00:47:39.467 --> 00:47:42.689]  had half the wealth, 4% of the population in 1955.
[00:47:42.889 --> 00:47:53.377]  The globalists wrote up the textbooks, the plan to transfer all the wealth out to China and other countries, to use that to set up a world government, planetary authoritarianism.
[00:47:55.413 --> 00:47:57.895]  2018, Apple is under the Chinese government control.
[00:47:58.536 --> 00:48:01.219]  They've now banned sending out the Taiwanese emoji.
[00:48:01.799 --> 00:48:02.820]  No one even seems to care.
[00:48:03.361 --> 00:48:08.145]  Now they say they're going to start censoring you, even on your own private text messages, criticizing China.
[00:48:08.626 --> 00:48:15.633]  And they've got your iPhone keys, they've got your photos, they've got the cloud, and Apple said that's just the way it is.
[00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:18.415]  They think you're habituated to accept it, just like
[00:48:19.136 --> 00:48:25.458]  Three days ago, Chertoff, the guy that personally made $30-something million off the naked body machines, his company made $2 billion.
[00:48:26.038 --> 00:48:27.499]  He said, you know what, it's too late.
[00:48:27.559 --> 00:48:28.459]  You're habituated.
[00:48:28.919 --> 00:48:29.959]  There is no privacy.
[00:48:30.039 --> 00:48:30.900]  Everything's on the cloud.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:31.560]  It's over.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:32.840]  You will assimilate.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.041]  See how that works?
[00:48:34.481 --> 00:48:39.402]  Total world government, total surveillance, big tech companies all lining up to move to China.
[00:48:40.203 --> 00:48:41.143]  They're going to run it all.
[00:48:42.039 --> 00:48:48.684]  A year and a half ago, the Chinese dictator went to Davos and he said, with Juncker, in a statement, he said, we will stop Trump in America.
[00:48:49.145 --> 00:48:50.286]  Global government will continue.
[00:48:50.346 --> 00:48:50.986]  They shook hands.
[00:48:51.507 --> 00:48:53.749]  And he said, move all your command bases to us.
[00:48:53.769 --> 00:48:55.250]  We will let you run anything you want.
[00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:56.951]  You'll be liability protected.
[00:48:57.492 --> 00:48:58.413]  Juncker said, absolutely.
[00:48:58.433 --> 00:49:00.494]  We'll start launching laws that shut down the U.S.
[00:49:00.554 --> 00:49:00.875]  Internet.
[00:49:01.175 --> 00:49:02.076]  We'll be exempt with you.
[00:49:02.096 --> 00:49:03.937]  And they said, absolutely, let's do it.
[00:49:05.038 --> 00:49:05.518]  And it's public.
[00:49:06.719 --> 00:49:07.100]  And it's on.
[00:49:08.331 --> 00:49:16.477]  And Trump is just trying to go over there and say, listen, you're not going to have a one-way street anymore where we pay for everything if you're going to side with the Chinese communists.
[00:49:16.517 --> 00:49:17.758]  That's really what's happening.
[00:49:17.778 --> 00:49:20.099]  They've all broken their deal that they had.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.462]  China's not supposed to militarily expand outside the South China Sea.
[00:49:24.943 --> 00:49:26.584]  They're supposed to be given economic dominance, though.
[00:49:26.804 --> 00:49:30.787]  The old globalist plan is being broken because it was always planned to be broken.
[00:49:31.892 --> 00:49:44.918]  So remember when you watch Homeland or you watch Sacha Baron Cohen's new show on the same channel or when you watch Colbert and all the rest of the shows attacking myself and Trump and saying horrible things?
[00:49:45.905 --> 00:49:47.585]  Remember, they're the cowards.
[00:49:47.626 --> 00:49:48.386]  They're the sellouts.
[00:49:48.746 --> 00:49:51.647]  They work for the big corporations that want the Chinese market.
[00:49:52.227 --> 00:49:56.508]  And to be in the Chinese market, you've got to comply with their censorship.
[00:49:57.188 --> 00:50:00.989]  You think Sacha Baron Cohen, with all his bodyguards, likes slave Americans?
[00:50:01.049 --> 00:50:02.330]  He sees himself as an elitist.
[00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:03.390]  Owning guns?
[00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:04.050]  No.
[00:50:05.491 --> 00:50:08.671]  So he goes out and acts dumb with guns, wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
[00:50:10.312 --> 00:50:10.832]  What's he saying?
[00:50:10.852 --> 00:50:11.992]  We're not going to make America great again.
[00:50:12.012 --> 00:50:13.813]  We're going to blow America's head off.
[00:50:15.029 --> 00:50:16.731]  Because Cohen's smarter than you.
[00:50:17.091 --> 00:50:18.252]  He's better than you.
[00:50:18.533 --> 00:50:19.414]  He runs you.
[00:50:19.674 --> 00:50:20.555]  He owns you.
[00:50:20.815 --> 00:50:21.916]  And he's going to show you.
[00:50:23.698 --> 00:50:34.329]  See, now Cohen's scared, and Hillary's scared, and all the rest of these guys are scared, because they did all this selling out, and all this arrogant garbage, and it didn't turn out the way they thought.
[00:50:34.369 --> 00:50:35.650]  Before I get to the congressional clips.
[00:50:36.499 --> 00:50:37.540]  Right through this segment and the next.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.363]  Let me, just if you're a TV viewer, pull this up for me, crew.
[00:50:41.964 --> 00:50:49.230]  CNN lobbies Facebook to shut down InfoWars and look at the smile of the executive at CNN.
[00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:50.551]  Man, he's in charge.
[00:50:50.591 --> 00:50:51.973]  He's part of the establishment.
[00:50:53.514 --> 00:51:03.083]  Social media giant admits it down ranks and basically shadow bans InfoWars but says a full ban would cause lawsuits and tries to explain to CNN
[00:51:14.353 --> 00:51:22.538]  It's just mind-boggling how obvious this is, and how disgusting, and how ridiculous.
[00:51:24.199 --> 00:51:30.562]  After failing in its efforts to have YouTube shut down the Alex Jones Channel, CNN is now lobbying Facebook to shut down InfoWars.
[00:51:31.543 --> 00:51:36.226]  An article for CNN's senior media reporter, Oliver Darcy,
[00:51:37.298 --> 00:51:39.139]  So he's the head of their media operations.
[00:51:39.519 --> 00:51:44.742]  Explains how he tried to convince Facebook, top brass, to terminate our Facebook presence.
[00:51:44.942 --> 00:51:45.322]  Wow!
[00:51:46.743 --> 00:51:47.763]  Talk about a lawsuit!
[00:51:49.344 --> 00:51:55.427]  Facebook invited me to an event today where the company aimed to tout its commitment to fighting fake news and misinformation.
[00:51:55.787 --> 00:51:58.789]  I asked them why InfoWars is still allowed on the platform.
[00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:00.650]  I didn't get a good answer.
[00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:05.252]  But at the end he says, well, they admit that they're censoring them down to nothing, but that's not enough.
[00:52:07.518 --> 00:52:14.779]  CNN, the kings of fake news, the kings of fake WMDs, the kings of there's no Martin Luther King bust, the kings of all the lies they tell.
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.480]  And the fake news they push.
[00:52:24.221 --> 00:52:27.362]  And then they have the nerve to then point at us and say shut us down.
[00:52:27.662 --> 00:52:30.582]  What an un-American group of dirtbags.
[00:52:31.663 --> 00:52:33.343]  What an un-American group of scum.
[00:52:35.259 --> 00:52:42.464]  And I've got the stack of news here where they brag, oh Jones was going to publish a book for the particular publisher called The War for the Future.
[00:52:43.885 --> 00:52:47.428]  They went out and threatened everybody and said don't do it till the publishers dropped out.
[00:52:47.808 --> 00:52:50.510]  Which I could self-publish and make it even bigger and we're planning to do that.
[00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:55.494]  But we see it and we wanted to let you try to censor it first and create that allure first, dumbasses.
[00:52:56.514 --> 00:52:59.777]  But the point is, is that there they are.
[00:53:01.107 --> 00:53:04.889]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the game author Neil Strauss, partnering on a book.
[00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:06.710]  They go on saying, shut it down.
[00:53:09.331 --> 00:53:12.313]  InfoWars main YouTube channel is two strikes away from being banned.
[00:53:12.333 --> 00:53:12.753]  CNN.
[00:53:12.993 --> 00:53:16.275]  And they say, we have been talking to YouTube and want it banned.
[00:53:16.315 --> 00:53:19.457]  And then they lied about what I was even saying to get it banned.
[00:53:20.357 --> 00:53:20.757]  Video.
[00:53:21.038 --> 00:53:23.399]  Jim Lawmaker demands Twitter censor InfoWars.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.021]  This is in congressional hearings.
[00:53:29.864 --> 00:53:32.666]  So, I'm going to ask you all, what are you going to do about this?
[00:53:32.866 --> 00:53:34.907]  You need to understand, we are the avant-garde.
[00:53:35.767 --> 00:53:38.009]  The local station you're listening to, please spread the word about it.
[00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.111]  Please spread the live links.
[00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:43.572]  Please spread the link to the podcast.
[00:53:43.852 --> 00:53:47.914]  Please spread the link to everybody you know to InfoWars.com forward slash show with the audio and video feeds.
[00:53:48.194 --> 00:53:52.197]  And please go to InfoWars.com forward slash app on your Android or your

[00:54:12.704 --> 00:54:16.125]  We're going to send it out on our newsletter today, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:54:16.145 --> 00:54:20.246]  But whatever you do, go there, get it.
[00:54:21.505 --> 00:54:21.985]  It's free.
[00:54:22.085 --> 00:54:23.566]  You are unstoppable.
[00:54:24.266 --> 00:54:25.607]  You can stop their algorithms.
[00:54:25.647 --> 00:54:28.828]  We have our own streams, our own video feeds, our own platforms.
[00:54:29.768 --> 00:54:32.509]  And we're here talking about what's really happening.
[00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:42.093]  We're here, day one, exposing the illegal FBI Clinton cabal of hatchet men and women to shut down Trump and to illegally surveil him and try to remove him.
[00:54:42.113 --> 00:54:43.093]  And they denied all that.
[00:54:43.193 --> 00:54:44.734]  It's confirmed they surveilled him.
[00:54:44.774 --> 00:54:46.614]  Hell, I was reading Politico yesterday.
[00:54:46.634 --> 00:54:50.436]  It had the headline, Mueller listening to
[00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:58.298]  Manafort's phone calls and using it to try to block his legal strategy.
[00:54:58.338 --> 00:54:59.498]  That's totally illegal.
[00:54:59.739 --> 00:55:04.221]  But they put it in the news to set the precedent to do stuff like that.
[00:55:08.063 --> 00:55:10.744]  We are in a new world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:12.372 --> 00:55:16.094]  When we come back, I'm going to play a compilation of Trump talking about CNN being fake news.
[00:55:16.495 --> 00:55:18.616]  Hey, just because somebody calls you fake news, does it make you fake news?
[00:55:18.676 --> 00:55:22.999]  No, the fact that you're known liars that are anti-American scum, that makes you fake news.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:31.164]  In fact, do we have time to go out with a little Mars attack montage where we equate the aliens saying, don't run, we're your friends with CNN?
[00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:38.134]  Now let's go ahead and go out to break with that right now because it says it all.
[00:55:38.214 --> 00:55:43.878]  And then please, feel free to, I'm going to retweet this video of CNN being fake news.
[00:55:43.898 --> 00:55:46.299]  I hope everybody shares it at Real Alex Jones right now.
[00:55:46.319 --> 00:55:47.140]  Here it is.
[00:55:47.941 --> 00:55:54.705]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that is really, really an awful situation.
[00:55:55.005 --> 00:55:57.207]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:55:57.247 --> 00:55:58.608]  We love the American people.
[00:56:09.813 --> 00:56:11.994]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:56:12.014 --> 00:56:13.495]  We love the American people.
[00:56:13.515 --> 00:56:15.056]  We love the American people.
[00:56:16.557 --> 00:56:18.538]  We love the American people.
[00:56:19.298 --> 00:56:33.166]  They came in peace.
[00:56:33.186 --> 00:56:35.387]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:56:35.407 --> 00:56:36.808]  We love the American people.
[00:56:44.014 --> 00:56:46.836]  They're trying to tear down our borders.
[00:56:46.856 --> 00:56:48.057]  They're trying to cause race war.
[00:56:48.077 --> 00:56:50.898]  They're trying to stop us from getting paid our fair share out of NATO.
[00:56:50.918 --> 00:56:58.303]  They're trying to screw us over because they were hired and trained by multinationals to capture this country via corporate social takeover in their own words.
[00:56:58.503 --> 00:56:59.924]  But now America is awake.
[00:57:00.264 --> 00:57:00.965]  Europe is awake.
[00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:02.205]  Latin America is awake.
[00:57:02.646 --> 00:57:10.831]  Everybody's waking up to the corporate colonization that's going on and the corporate system of neo-colonial rule.
[00:57:11.886 --> 00:57:14.608]  Everyone knows what's happening now who has a brain.
[00:57:14.888 --> 00:57:18.451]  And so, the globalists are going to get a lot nastier before they give up.
[00:57:19.411 --> 00:57:22.954]  But in the end, they're going to have to give up because the worm has turned.
[00:57:22.974 --> 00:57:24.335]  They're on the wrong side of history.
[00:57:24.355 --> 00:57:27.377]  There's been a global political realignment to crony capitalism.
[00:57:27.597 --> 00:57:29.118]  We'll be back with our number two.
[00:57:29.158 --> 00:57:29.559]  Stay with us.
[00:57:29.799 --> 00:57:30.960]  The President of the United States.
[00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:33.381]  The U.S.
[00:57:33.702 --> 00:57:34.943]  President is Donald Trump.
[00:57:41.889 --> 00:57:45.250]  Alexa, who's the President of the United States?
[00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:46.251]  Donald J. Trump.
[00:57:46.651 --> 00:57:54.834]  Stay with us.
[00:57:55.594 --> 00:58:02.236]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:03.297 --> 00:58:03.777]  It's you.
[00:58:08.064 --> 00:58:15.471]  The Info Warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:58:15.811 --> 00:58:20.035]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:58:20.375 --> 00:58:21.296]  You are the Info Warrior.
[00:58:21.817 --> 00:58:25.360]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever.
[00:58:26.104 --> 00:58:37.631]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:47.578]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[00:58:48.178 --> 00:58:54.480]  They're trying to use InfoWars as an example of demonization to keep people from sharing this critical information.
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:59.061]  It's a model they admit they plan to use on everybody else once they're done with us.
[00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:08.183]  So when you promote the black sheep trailblazing information from NewsWars.com, from PrisonPlanet.com, from InfoWars.com, you are following
[00:59:08.183 --> 00:59:13.407]  Following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country, we have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:59:13.887 --> 00:59:18.831]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is, or what sex we are, or where we came from.
[00:59:19.411 --> 00:59:27.056]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:27.557 --> 00:59:34.282]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:34.602 --> 00:59:35.963]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[00:59:36.383 --> 00:59:37.924]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[00:59:38.245 --> 00:59:39.786]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[00:59:40.407 --> 00:59:42.108]  And many others are across the world.
[00:59:42.329 --> 00:59:43.089]  We are the future.
[00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.951]  We are the renaissance.
[00:59:45.511 --> 00:59:46.793]  And we are winning.
[00:59:52.918 --> 00:59:58.844]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.616 --> 01:00:11.322]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:47.959]  Alright, I promise next segment I'm going to get into the highlights of the incredible Strzok and other FBI creatures that have been Democratic hatchet men, they aren't really FBI agents, that have been grilled in Congress today.
[01:00:47.979 --> 01:00:50.280]  It's amazing, it's coming up next segment.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.222]  But if you just joined us, they have Sacha Baron Cohen, stalking InfoWars,
[01:00:56.471 --> 01:00:59.854]  And I'm exclusively now learning that this has been going on for six months.
[01:01:00.474 --> 01:01:01.595]  We're putting the pieces together.
[01:01:02.376 --> 01:01:03.056]  It's all confirmed.
[01:01:03.096 --> 01:01:03.837]  Breitbart's got it.
[01:01:03.977 --> 01:01:07.720]  He's been going around like an InfoWars listener, dressed up in InfoWars t-shirts, bumper stickers.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.702]  It's not just the stickers on his laptop.
[01:01:10.742 --> 01:01:14.365]  He's been saying he's an InfoWars supporter, and then saying horrible racist stuff.
[01:01:14.865 --> 01:01:18.528]  You've got CNN calling for us to be banned off Facebook, and once that precedent's set, it's everybody.
[01:01:18.828 --> 01:01:21.010]  Facebook says we're already censoring him down to nothing.
[01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.391]  That's why you've got to actually go to InfoWars.com.
[01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:31.294]  But imagine, just if you say somebody's fake news, like CNN executives do, when they're really the fake news, does that mean that it happens?
[01:01:31.634 --> 01:01:32.655]  It's tortious interference.
[01:01:32.715 --> 01:01:35.917]  It's criminal war against other people's free speech.
[01:01:35.997 --> 01:01:37.818]  It's racketeering on its face.
[01:01:38.238 --> 01:01:41.440]  So here's the president really calling out who the fake news is.
[01:01:42.406 --> 01:01:42.806]  Sit down.
[01:01:43.227 --> 01:01:43.527]  Sit down.
[01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:44.789]  We'll get it.
[01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:50.775]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir... I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:52.977]  Doesn't that under... Very fake news.
[01:01:53.037 --> 01:01:55.019]  I know, but aren't you... Pause.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:55.880]  Back it up.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.481]  Start over again.
[01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:58.543]  They... Hillary created the term.
[01:01:58.643 --> 01:01:59.384]  They ran with it.
[01:01:59.404 --> 01:02:01.506]  Then everybody goes, okay, what's real, what's fake?
[01:02:01.546 --> 01:02:04.429]  We think you're the standard of fake news, CNN, along with MSNBC.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:06.960]  An NPR.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.301]  I mean, you're famous for being a bunch of pack of liars.
[01:02:09.961 --> 01:02:11.802]  Who think everybody's asleep and you rule on America.
[01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:14.243]  And so then you're like, how dare you call us fake news?
[01:02:14.283 --> 01:02:15.463]  You little cockroach!
[01:02:17.043 --> 01:02:17.984]  You are fake news.
[01:02:18.004 --> 01:02:18.404]  Here it is.
[01:02:19.164 --> 01:02:19.584]  Sit down.
[01:02:19.984 --> 01:02:20.285]  Sit down.
[01:02:20.425 --> 01:02:21.545]  We'll get it.
[01:02:21.585 --> 01:02:27.547]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir... I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[01:02:28.027 --> 01:02:29.748]  Doesn't that undermine... Very fake news.
[01:02:29.808 --> 01:02:30.568]  I know, but aren't you...
[01:02:33.601 --> 01:02:34.261]  Go ahead.
[01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:35.862]  Real news, Mr. President, real news.
[01:02:36.162 --> 01:02:42.423]  Aren't you, aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press?
[01:02:42.924 --> 01:02:46.324]  No, criticizing you is not violent in the First Amendment term.
[01:02:46.865 --> 01:02:50.305]  And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.
[01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:51.146]  It's fake.
[01:02:51.486 --> 01:02:51.886]  Phony.
[01:02:52.066 --> 01:02:52.346]  Fake.
[01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:55.527]  Think about how
[01:02:56.883 --> 01:03:00.106]  They always say Trump's violating the First Amendment saying they're lying about him.
[01:03:00.466 --> 01:03:03.068]  Then they're calling for everybody to be shut down and off the air.
[01:03:03.769 --> 01:03:07.312]  Again, they're the ones, they're the authoritarian danger to the First Amendment.
[01:03:07.372 --> 01:03:08.133]  They're the enemy!
[01:03:08.153 --> 01:03:12.276]  And then they say us saying they're liars is violating the First Amendment.
[01:03:12.436 --> 01:03:13.717]  You little lying roach!
[01:03:14.478 --> 01:03:16.460]  We're just countering you, you dirtbag!
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.121]  You anti-free speech maggot!
[01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:19.983]  Owned by foreign chycoms!
[01:03:20.223 --> 01:03:21.484]  Go back to this piece of crap!
[01:03:26.138 --> 01:03:29.959]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
[01:03:30.119 --> 01:03:30.699]  And they are.
[01:03:31.059 --> 01:03:32.420]  They are the enemy of the people.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:32.960]  Damn right.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.381]  It's a disgrace what took place.
[01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:37.421]  It's a disgrace.
[01:03:37.861 --> 01:03:41.162]  And I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.
[01:03:41.182 --> 01:03:43.623]  Sir, since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[01:03:43.823 --> 01:03:44.263]  Go ahead.
[01:03:44.723 --> 01:03:45.463]  No, Mr. President-elect.
[01:03:45.483 --> 01:03:45.823]  Go ahead.
[01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:46.384]  Go ahead.
[01:03:46.404 --> 01:03:49.064]  Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance?
[01:03:49.124 --> 01:03:49.584]  No, not you.
[01:03:49.624 --> 01:03:49.924]  Not you.
[01:03:49.964 --> 01:03:51.185]  Your organization is terrible.
[01:03:51.205 --> 01:03:52.265]  You are attacking our news organization.
[01:03:52.285 --> 01:03:53.245]  Your organization is terrible.
[01:03:53.265 --> 01:03:54.746]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[01:03:54.786 --> 01:03:55.106]  Go ahead.
[01:03:55.786 --> 01:03:57.507]  Quiet, quiet.
[01:03:57.547 --> 01:04:00.088]  Go ahead, she's asking a question, don't be rude.
[01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:00.768]  Don't be rude.
[01:04:00.828 --> 01:04:01.548]  Don't be rude.
[01:04:01.568 --> 01:04:03.429]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:07.591]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[01:04:07.631 --> 01:04:08.951]  You are fake news.
[01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:09.712]  Go ahead.
[01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:19.815]  America's closest allies were frustrated with you and angry with you, and that you were angry with them, and that you were leaving here early to go meet for more friendlier talks with Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
[01:04:19.835 --> 01:04:22.016]  And I'm wondering if you view it the same way,
[01:04:23.977 --> 01:04:25.598]  And do you view the U.S.
[01:04:25.878 --> 01:04:28.160]  alliance system shifting under your presidency?
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.861]  Who are you with, out of curiosity?
[01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:30.801]  CNN.
[01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:33.483]  I figured.
[01:04:33.523 --> 01:04:34.503]  Fake news, CNN.
[01:04:34.963 --> 01:04:35.424]  The worst.
[01:04:36.304 --> 01:04:38.946]  But, you know, I could tell by the... I have no idea you're with CNN.
[01:04:39.186 --> 01:04:41.287]  After the question, I was just curious as to who you're with.
[01:04:41.307 --> 01:04:41.967]  You're with CNN.
[01:04:42.968 --> 01:04:45.850]  I would say that the level of relationship is a 10.
[01:04:47.719 --> 01:04:50.243]  But if you go, as an example, you're CNN.
[01:04:50.903 --> 01:04:55.129]  I mean, it's story after story after story is bad.
[01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:56.311]  I won!
[01:04:56.331 --> 01:04:57.312]  I won!
[01:05:02.771 --> 01:05:05.753]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[01:05:06.053 --> 01:05:06.313]  Go ahead.
[01:05:06.553 --> 01:05:12.156]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:05:12.357 --> 01:05:13.437]  I'd done the War Room.
[01:05:13.737 --> 01:05:16.199]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:05:16.219 --> 01:05:17.780]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.500]  I was exhausted.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.042]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[01:05:22.382 --> 01:05:27.025]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[01:05:27.105 --> 01:05:29.126]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:05:29.186 --> 01:05:29.927]  The same thing.
[01:05:30.367 --> 01:05:31.928]  Put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.248]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:05:33.428 --> 01:05:35.269]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:41.531]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:05:41.832 --> 01:05:42.672]  You can sleep with it.
[01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:47.294]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:05:47.354 --> 01:05:50.135]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:05:50.295 --> 01:05:51.996]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:52.816]  It really works.
[01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:57.618]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found, and I've tried them all.
[01:05:57.998 --> 01:06:00.159]  I wasted a lot of money in old boots, believe me.
[01:06:06.152 --> 01:06:12.190]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:24.656 --> 01:06:25.296]  Welcome back!
[01:06:25.796 --> 01:06:46.641]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the most hated, dreaded sites in the world, by communists, by globalists, by pedophiles, by scum, by organized crime, by megabanks, loved by freedom lovers all over the planet, loved by patriots, loved by Christians, loved by gun owners, loved by common sense, red-blooded humans.
[01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:51.943]  And I am just very honored that CNN and others are calling for us to be completely banned off the internet.
[01:06:52.303 --> 01:06:53.444]  Already covered that last hour.
[01:06:53.504 --> 01:07:04.048]  Sacha Baron Cohen, we learned, tried to lie to us just like Sarah Palin six months ago, saying, oh, it's a story about Trump people versus other folks.
[01:07:04.148 --> 01:07:05.429]  It's a very fair and balanced program.
[01:07:05.969 --> 01:07:08.710]  And I said, oh, like Homeland that's tailored around lying about me?
[01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.271]  I said, go fly a kite.
[01:07:11.175 --> 01:07:16.159]  Well, reportedly, according to sources, they did do a partial infiltration of InfoWars.
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:18.622]  Not the office, but through some of our sources.
[01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:24.106]  And I may be revealing some of that very, very soon.
[01:07:24.126 --> 01:07:26.428]  Obviously, people signed non-disclosures.
[01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:34.235]  But if they've been involved in fraud, and if Cohen lied to them, we're going to get them some lawyers, and we'll be able to get around all that very easily.
[01:07:34.856 --> 01:07:37.278]  Because Sacha Baron Cohen is a fake news fraud.
[01:07:37.298 --> 01:07:37.999]  He isn't a comedian.
[01:07:38.649 --> 01:07:41.151]  He goes out and defames people and then hides behind entertainment.
[01:07:42.532 --> 01:07:47.356]  And then they source what he says about me and other shows say about me, and then use that to try to take us off the air.
[01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:48.932]  So that's coming up.
[01:07:49.252 --> 01:07:57.058]  But the good news is, GOP lawmakers threaten FBI agent Peter Strzok with contempt for refusing to answer questions about Mueller probe.
[01:07:57.438 --> 01:07:58.339]  Same thing with Orr.
[01:07:58.839 --> 01:07:59.159]  U.S.
[01:07:59.219 --> 01:08:01.981]  Marshals serve subpoena on Mr. Ed.
[01:08:02.081 --> 01:08:04.123]  I mean FBI lawyer Lisa Page.
[01:08:05.444 --> 01:08:11.909]  Wilbur Goodlight says threatening to hold her in contempt.
[01:08:13.018 --> 01:08:18.303]  So let's go ahead and go to the congressman letting her know how the cow ate the cabbage, or I guess how the horse ate the cabbage.
[01:08:18.323 --> 01:08:18.624]  Here it is.
[01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:39.423]  Mr. Chairman, as you know, counsel for the FBI has directed me not to answer questions about the ongoing investigation.
[01:08:39.643 --> 01:08:42.585]  As you also know, counsel for the FBI is sitting here behind me.
[01:08:43.045 --> 01:08:44.005]  May I consult with them?
[01:08:45.546 --> 01:08:47.047]  You may consult with your own counsel.
[01:08:47.728 --> 01:08:49.729]  But I may not consult with the FBI's counsel?
[01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:51.690]  Only with your own counsel!
[01:08:52.412 --> 01:08:53.953]  Look at what a weasel that enemy is.
[01:08:53.973 --> 01:08:55.494]  Mr. Chairman, there's no basis for that.
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.101]  This is the guy.
[01:09:09.641 --> 01:09:12.423]  He later testifies that he was never biased in his history with the FBI.
[01:09:12.443 --> 01:09:14.224]  He's like, insurance policy.
[01:09:14.244 --> 01:09:15.064]  He won't be president.
[01:09:15.344 --> 01:09:16.225]  We're gonna stop him.
[01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:17.846]  Hillary's the president.
[01:09:18.286 --> 01:09:19.887]  Covered up the Hillary investigation.
[01:09:20.347 --> 01:09:27.892]  And then he sits there, this arrogant little rat bastard, and with his ugly girlfriend.
[01:09:27.912 --> 01:09:30.133]  And I don't just mean that to be, I mean, spiritually ugly.
[01:09:30.153 --> 01:09:34.676]  It just shows what a bunch of broke-back, stupid rats they are.
[01:09:35.376 --> 01:09:37.518]  And they've all got chips on their shoulders because
[01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:43.373]  Peter Strzok looks like somebody nobody would want to go have a beer with.
[01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:52.480]  His wife or his girlfriend looks like somebody who basically, you know, gets their meals out of cat boxes.
[01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:59.285]  And you just look at these culturally, spiritually dead people, and you know why they want to piss on us.
[01:09:59.725 --> 01:10:01.787]  Because they hate real Americans, folks.
[01:10:02.645 --> 01:10:04.066]  I mean, these people are trash.
[01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:11.990]  And the reason I say that is, as a strong, successful person my whole life, I always cared about everybody and didn't feel like I wanted to put people down.
[01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:18.114]  But when you are a piece of garbage like them, they want to hurt everybody and be on top.
[01:10:18.654 --> 01:10:20.075]  They're like Eddie Haskell on PCP.
[01:10:21.525 --> 01:10:22.186]  I'm going to stop.
[01:10:22.266 --> 01:10:25.128]  If you're a radio listener and you can't see it, it's probably a good thing.
[01:10:25.148 --> 01:10:29.071]  It's this lying, anti-American person that hates the American voters, all of them.
[01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:31.753]  Just look at these little nobody weasels.
[01:10:32.113 --> 01:10:38.959]  They're the scum that the Chai-coms and the globalists and the big banks in Hollywood could hire to F this country over.
[01:10:39.219 --> 01:10:43.042]  And it feels so good to see them circling hell!
[01:10:46.124 --> 01:10:47.945]  No, I mean, this is what's been beating us!
[01:10:48.005 --> 01:10:57.587]  It's like the Bible says, in Revelation, when they finally captured the devil and put him in a cage for a thousand years, people come and look at him and they say, this is the thing that almost destroyed everybody?
[01:10:58.288 --> 01:10:58.968]  Look at Hillary!
[01:10:59.168 --> 01:10:59.428]  This!
[01:11:00.208 --> 01:11:01.148]  Look at Weinstein!
[01:11:01.509 --> 01:11:02.329]  Look at Obama!
[01:11:02.589 --> 01:11:03.529]  These people!
[01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:06.630]  These are the people holding us back?
[01:11:07.991 --> 01:11:08.991]  Move, bitch!
[01:11:09.251 --> 01:11:10.331]  Get out the way!
[01:11:10.591 --> 01:11:11.732]  Move out the way, bitch!
[01:11:11.772 --> 01:11:12.672]  Get out the way!
[01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:20.970]  I don't usually use mild, unfamily-friendly stuff, but when the shoe fits, I want to go out with the intro of Ludacris' Move Bitch.
[01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:25.451]  It was a theme song for the campaign, and it's just too good to not play!
[01:11:30.072 --> 01:11:31.832]  Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty, booty!
[01:11:35.673 --> 01:11:36.673]  You see them headlights?
[01:11:37.433 --> 01:11:39.093]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[01:11:39.394 --> 01:11:40.954]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[01:11:41.014 --> 01:11:41.634]  Tell me that!
[01:11:42.688 --> 01:11:43.908]  Excuse me, I'm having a little bit of fun here.
[01:11:44.148 --> 01:11:45.209]  Go back to that weasel.
[01:11:45.269 --> 01:11:45.889]  Put him back up there.
[01:11:45.909 --> 01:11:47.169]  I apologize for the family show.
[01:11:47.389 --> 01:11:48.129]  I'm not doing it anymore.
[01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.950]  Go ahead.
[01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:51.490]  Only with your own counsel.
[01:11:53.431 --> 01:11:55.271]  Mr. Chairman, there's no basis for that.
[01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.931]  He can consult with the FBI counsel.
[01:11:57.232 --> 01:11:57.852]  He's an FBI employee.
[01:11:57.892 --> 01:11:59.372]  The gentleman is not recognized.
[01:11:59.392 --> 01:12:00.132]  Look at that smile.
[01:12:00.152 --> 01:12:01.473]  And the chairman is not being proper.
[01:12:02.113 --> 01:12:03.473]  The chairman is being proper.
[01:12:03.493 --> 01:12:06.994]  A witness can't be directed not to confer with his attorney.
[01:12:07.901 --> 01:12:10.383]  The FBI is not his attorney.
[01:12:10.843 --> 01:12:12.284]  His attorney is seated behind him.
[01:12:12.304 --> 01:12:14.066]  Look how the Democrats all look like criminals.
[01:12:14.126 --> 01:12:14.786]  He's already done.
[01:12:14.866 --> 01:12:15.567]  He may do so.
[01:12:15.587 --> 01:12:17.889]  And his attorney may consult with the FBI attorney.
[01:12:17.909 --> 01:12:18.309]  Hit pause again.
[01:12:18.589 --> 01:12:24.374]  Notice why he can confer with the other person's attorney, because they're all in a 43-person cabal against America with those...
[01:12:25.054 --> 01:12:33.258]  Pieces of trash that control the blue cities and San Francisco's losing all of its conferences now because there's so much feces and vomit and heroin needles.
[01:12:33.818 --> 01:12:34.658]  ABC News 7.
[01:12:35.078 --> 01:12:39.980]  San Francisco losing lucrative convention industry because of streets filled with needles and feces.
[01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:47.063]  Everywhere you run things, it's little demonic pig creatures feeding on a bunch of slaves.
[01:12:47.183 --> 01:12:47.884]  Good God!
[01:12:48.124 --> 01:12:48.844]  Let me stop right there.
[01:12:49.925 --> 01:12:51.085]  Let's just go back to these people.
[01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:52.566]  Just looking at Democrats does this to me.
[01:12:52.606 --> 01:12:52.786]  Go ahead.
[01:12:53.976 --> 01:13:00.698]  Isn't the privilege that of the FBI and shouldn't the FBI counsel be solicited on that point?
[01:13:00.878 --> 01:13:08.820]  Mr. Chairman, my counsel has reiterated that counsel for the FBI has directed that I may not answer that question.
[01:13:24.042 --> 01:13:38.124]  Mr. Strzok, in a moment we will continue with the hearing, but based on your refusal to answer the question, at the conclusion of the day we will be recessing the hearing, and you will be subject to recall to allow the committee to consider proceeding with a contempt citation.
[01:13:38.505 --> 01:13:39.465]  A point of order, Mr. Chairman.
[01:13:39.485 --> 01:13:45.426]  Will the committee also consider contempt for Mr. Bannon, who refused to answer Mr. Gowdy's questions when he was actually under subpoena?
[01:13:45.826 --> 01:13:48.306]  That is not a proper point of order in this hearing.
[01:13:48.326 --> 01:13:49.306]  Mr. Gowdy, do you remember that?
[01:13:49.326 --> 01:13:50.307]  Mr. Gowdy, do you remember that?
[01:13:53.027 --> 01:13:56.530]  Now go back to Strzok at the last point when he's looking at the chairman.
[01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:58.431]  He's literally like a demon rat.
[01:13:58.451 --> 01:14:02.574]  I almost had America.
[01:14:02.815 --> 01:14:04.236]  I'll get you American nephew.
[01:14:04.736 --> 01:14:05.397]  It's I run it.
[01:14:05.617 --> 01:14:06.137]  I run it.
[01:14:06.197 --> 01:14:07.118]  I control it.
[01:14:07.198 --> 01:14:07.938]  Not you.
[01:14:08.739 --> 01:14:10.200]  All sold out to foreign powers.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.321]  All sold out to shycoms.
[01:14:11.821 --> 01:14:12.162]  Look at him.
[01:14:12.562 --> 01:14:13.483]  Look at those devil eyes.
[01:14:13.963 --> 01:14:14.804]  It's my country.
[01:14:15.724 --> 01:14:16.645]  Their mother's in hell.
[01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:17.686]  We control everything.
[01:14:17.726 --> 01:14:19.027]  Yeah, you don't control nothing.
[01:14:19.507 --> 01:14:20.748]  The spirit is rising.
[01:14:20.768 --> 01:14:21.429]  You're going down.
[01:14:23.069 --> 01:14:23.930]  We have the Ludacris song?
[01:14:25.831 --> 01:14:26.452]  Radio friendly?
[01:14:32.017 --> 01:14:33.998]  I can't help it, I apologize, I gotta play it.
[01:14:34.479 --> 01:14:36.040]  Just get out the way, Strzok!
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:42.525]  Get out the way with your stupid control freak chicken neck girlfriend who thought she'd beaten America!
[01:14:42.906 --> 01:14:43.927]  America's awake now!
[01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:45.608]  Move, Hillary!
[01:14:45.828 --> 01:14:46.829]  Get out the way!
[01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:07.589]  Yeah, we got a radio friendly, so I don't know how it works.
[01:15:41.903 --> 01:15:46.467]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War when the U.S.
[01:15:46.527 --> 01:15:50.430]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships
[01:16:10.545 --> 01:16:13.128]  That John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:19.053]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[01:16:19.073 --> 01:16:25.538]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:27.280]  But he didn't give up.
[01:16:28.561 --> 01:16:29.062]  And he won.
[01:16:30.743 --> 01:16:32.144]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[01:16:32.905 --> 01:16:36.989]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall to give them victory.
[01:16:38.221 --> 01:16:41.542]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[01:16:42.562 --> 01:16:45.083]  And they all died, all 180 plus men.
[01:16:45.523 --> 01:16:50.424]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:56.285]  So I don't know how the Infowars fight is gonna end.
[01:16:57.506 --> 01:16:58.126]  But I know this.
[01:17:00.626 --> 01:17:02.067]  Faced with the same challenges,
[01:17:03.248 --> 01:17:13.115]  John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance.
[01:17:14.075 --> 01:17:20.900]  I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[01:17:22.406 --> 01:17:26.109]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:34.577]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[01:17:36.979 --> 01:17:46.487]  But that said, just like our information is game changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[01:17:48.857 --> 01:17:57.960]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there, same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less, or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:09.664]  PQQ, CoQ10, and the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[01:18:10.064 --> 01:18:16.766]  They sell PQQ in little bottles with a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule.
[01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:22.702]  And it is, again, the third as much, and it's like 40, 50 bucks for a little bottle.
[01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:25.282]  Think about that.
[01:18:25.362 --> 01:18:26.203]  It's $74 right now.
[01:18:27.143 --> 01:18:32.084]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[01:18:33.124 --> 01:18:34.404]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[01:18:34.464 --> 01:18:42.806]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[01:18:43.146 --> 01:18:44.846]  So I signed a bigger contract, got a better deal.
[01:18:45.866 --> 01:18:52.872]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product So I'm not gambled.
[01:18:53.452 --> 01:18:54.333]  I know you want value.
[01:18:54.373 --> 01:19:11.387]  So we've bought even more of it We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it and we've got it right now At the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere DNA force go read the five-star reviews thousands of go see what people said it did for them.
[01:19:11.827 --> 01:19:12.788]  It is dramatic and
[01:19:13.965 --> 01:19:21.747]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:30.969]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[01:19:31.509 --> 01:19:38.091]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[01:19:40.968 --> 01:19:46.572]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[01:19:46.772 --> 01:19:47.232]  That's fine.
[01:19:48.673 --> 01:19:49.734]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[01:19:50.154 --> 01:19:50.854]  I'm funded by you.
[01:19:51.075 --> 01:19:51.955]  So thank you all.
[01:19:52.636 --> 01:19:57.619]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[01:19:58.159 --> 01:20:00.881]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[01:20:04.823 --> 01:20:07.445]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.762 --> 01:20:21.483]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[01:20:22.064 --> 01:20:26.805]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.566 --> 01:20:39.070]  Well, Larry Grafwald was a Green Beret, highly decorated in Vietnam, a patriot going to college, and the weatherman were actually at his college openly trying to recruit military members at the time for their whole malice operation.
[01:20:40.206 --> 01:20:41.708]  And he got into the organization.
[01:20:41.748 --> 01:20:43.049]  They were openly coming out.
[01:20:43.069 --> 01:20:47.253]  They were going to take over the schools, create a race war, put 50 million people in camps, kill 25 million.
[01:20:47.573 --> 01:20:48.734]  We'll play the clip coming up later.
[01:20:48.834 --> 01:20:49.775]  And you know the great part about it?
[01:20:49.795 --> 01:20:50.376]  We all live forever.
[01:20:50.816 --> 01:20:51.957]  I'm my great-great-grandparents.
[01:20:52.017 --> 01:20:53.659]  My children will be me as long as we go on.
[01:20:53.999 --> 01:20:56.841]  So Larry Graff is with us now in the body of Lindsey Graff Wall.
[01:20:57.482 --> 01:20:58.743]  And of course her mother's with her as well.
[01:20:58.763 --> 01:21:00.345]  That's how this works, this magic of life.
[01:21:00.845 --> 01:21:02.326]  And she goes out to prayer vigils.
[01:21:02.347 --> 01:21:03.347]  She's been to a bunch of these.
[01:21:04.048 --> 01:21:08.511]  Where sometimes there's 50 or 60 of them, sometimes there's just 7 or 8, looks like in the video I saw this weekend.
[01:21:09.152 --> 01:21:11.394]  And Antifa came in.
[01:21:12.574 --> 01:21:16.077]  Looks like, you know, you've got a transsexual there leading them in their prayer meeting.
[01:21:16.117 --> 01:21:16.898]  It's open to everybody.
[01:21:17.538 --> 01:21:20.180]  A lot of liberals actually come out there, classical liberals who are for free speech.
[01:21:20.801 --> 01:21:29.547]  And here comes, looks like about 15 thugs who then mainly attack women and a transsexual and a Hispanic man.
[01:21:30.888 --> 01:21:33.070]  And then of course they fight them off and they leave.
[01:21:34.184 --> 01:21:41.568]  So, it is interesting to see the tranny beat up four or five of them.
[01:21:42.428 --> 01:21:48.011]  By the way, Facebook bans us when we use the word tranny, because they say that's a word Twitter voted to say is mean.
[01:21:48.051 --> 01:21:48.932]  I'm not being mean to anybody.
[01:21:48.952 --> 01:21:49.912]  That's the term they came up with.
[01:21:49.952 --> 01:21:50.352]  I'm using it.
[01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:51.213]  Transsexual, whatever.
[01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:55.255]  I don't care what you are, just don't teach it to kids, whether it be heterosexual, whatever it is.
[01:21:55.315 --> 01:21:56.015]  That's a side issue.
[01:21:56.616 --> 01:21:58.116]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see all this.
[01:21:58.156 --> 01:21:58.877]  I'm describing it.
[01:21:59.417 --> 01:22:00.057]  For radio listeners.
[01:22:00.077 --> 01:22:02.999]  A lot of people email us and they go, why is Jones describing everything on air?
[01:22:04.079 --> 01:22:12.903]  Because we're on almost 270 radio affiliates and it's a huge audience and it's bigger while people are listening than all the other streams, TV stations, everything.
[01:22:13.743 --> 01:22:17.905]  So I'm kind of narrating for folks when things aren't radio friendly.
[01:22:17.945 --> 01:22:18.785]  That's what's happening.
[01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:21.206]  We pioneered simulcasting radio on TV.
[01:22:22.287 --> 01:22:22.967]  So that's what we do.
[01:22:23.467 --> 01:22:24.628]  Because it's very confusing.
[01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:27.923]  I'm talking about something and not describing it.
[01:22:28.703 --> 01:22:33.164]  So she joins us in the middle of the left saying, ban InfoWars, ban Trump off Twitter.
[01:22:34.685 --> 01:22:37.125]  We've got all this craziness going on right now.
[01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:38.746]  It's all up on InfoWars.com.
[01:22:38.946 --> 01:22:44.267]  And Lindsey joins us, she goes out there, and again, this happened in Portland a month ago.
[01:22:44.307 --> 01:22:45.768]  They beat up a bunch of men, women, and children.
[01:22:45.788 --> 01:22:47.348]  There's only a few men there at a prayer vigil.
[01:22:47.848 --> 01:22:53.570]  So then a few dozen men like Rufio show up, and even though they're 10 to 1, they beat the butts of those guys.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:59.442]  And so, again, these are all in blue cities, where the police stand down and allow this to happen.
[01:22:59.463 --> 01:23:01.264]  It's very, very, very, very shameful.
[01:23:01.804 --> 01:23:05.266]  And I don't know where on earth you get men that are willing to attack women.
[01:23:05.886 --> 01:23:13.791]  I mean, you see the left claiming they love women, they're going to take care of women, and all men are bad, but then it's the left I always see when I was trying to get into Trump's inauguration.
[01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:16.392]  That was attacking women trying to get in.
[01:23:16.972 --> 01:23:28.915]  So there's just something about these cowards that, and I guess they thought when they punched the large transsexual that it was a woman, because then the transsexual, proving it's a man, beats up a bunch of them.
[01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:30.716]  So you can't make this up.
[01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:34.377]  Transsexuals beating him up, one guy beating a bunch up, women beating him up.
[01:23:36.338 --> 01:23:38.978]  Lindsey Grathwald, we salute you, we appreciate your courage.
[01:23:39.239 --> 01:23:40.579]  Thanks for coming on to tell us what happened.
[01:23:41.633 --> 01:23:42.313]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:23:42.453 --> 01:23:43.514]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:23:43.534 --> 01:23:45.455]  Yeah, it was crazy.
[01:23:45.595 --> 01:23:52.878]  And that, the transsexual, she actually, her name is Amber Cummings, and she actually threw that event in San Francisco on Saturday.
[01:23:52.898 --> 01:23:55.219]  Good for her.
[01:23:55.339 --> 01:23:58.260]  Yeah, she's actually, she's out with us on the street.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:04.643]  She was in Portland with me and Joey and Rufio and all of us up there last month, which was really crazy.
[01:24:04.683 --> 01:24:10.045]  And I can watch that video clip of Rufio knocking that guy out over and over again, and it never gets old.
[01:24:11.644 --> 01:24:13.166]  So yeah, we went out there.
[01:24:13.526 --> 01:24:17.610]  We've been planning a prayer vigil for Tommy Robinson for over a month.
[01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:27.439]  And as you see, we had a very small group of people that came out, but we hadn't even been there for 10 minutes and literally there were already people trying to attack us.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:30.721]  Part of this event is not on video.
[01:24:30.901 --> 01:24:40.647]  Nobody got it on video, but Amber actually knocked one of the Antifa guys in the nose, and I believe she probably broke his nose because he was pretty bloody.
[01:24:41.107 --> 01:24:44.089]  And that was before he came back with this group.
[01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:50.693]  They literally came back about 10 minutes later, and they were obviously there to fight.
[01:24:52.194 --> 01:24:53.374]  And we called the cops.
[01:24:53.394 --> 01:24:58.898]  The cops took about 30 minutes to get there, which was, you know, pretty typical in these blue cities.
[01:24:59.918 --> 01:25:04.861]  But San Francisco's usually been pretty good to us, so we were kind of surprised that it took so long for them to show up.
[01:25:06.451 --> 01:25:07.912]  But this is what happens.
[01:25:08.052 --> 01:25:09.554]  This is what happens in these cities.
[01:25:10.274 --> 01:25:13.537]  You know, you saw it in Portland, you've seen it in San Francisco, and we've seen it in Berkeley.
[01:25:13.697 --> 01:25:15.198]  It happens in all these cities.
[01:25:15.298 --> 01:25:19.942]  And basically, they're trying to shut us down, you know, at any cost.
[01:25:19.962 --> 01:25:22.244]  They don't want us out there, you know, talking.
[01:25:22.664 --> 01:25:25.907]  Anything that we have to say, anything that we're out there trying to promote.
[01:25:26.267 --> 01:25:34.194]  This particular event, they said that we were racist, that Tommy Robinson is racist, and so that makes us racist, and that was their whole
[01:25:35.755 --> 01:25:37.596]  Reason for coming out and trying to stop us.
[01:25:38.997 --> 01:26:04.214]  You know it's amazing how within very quickly you guys meeting they already show up meaning they're stalking you they're watching you and even if folks don't want to get in the fights when you see these events happening you should go and wait across the street with your camera as if you're neutral show you actually get what happens because they attack folks that have cameras so you can park your car be ready catch it on tape that's what we really need to get the full exchanges to document exactly what happened.
[01:26:05.037 --> 01:26:08.301]  Yeah, and it's difficult, especially when you're in the mix of all of it.
[01:26:08.722 --> 01:26:12.567]  It's difficult to get, you know, the whole thing on video.
[01:26:12.687 --> 01:26:20.858]  I mean, I was videoing as well, and I didn't even, you know, I didn't even know some of the stuff happened until it was all over, because it's hard to catch everything on video.
[01:26:20.878 --> 01:26:22.641]  So what you just said is absolutely correct.
[01:26:23.081 --> 01:26:32.185]  If someone, you know, sees it and they can get in a vantage point where they're across the street and get it on video, we need to get these kind of things on video to show what's going on.
[01:26:32.205 --> 01:26:35.567]  Because this is happening, and this is happening in cities all over the country.
[01:26:36.496 --> 01:26:44.478]  There are so many videos, in fact we should have done a compilation for the show, but it's my fault I'm telling the crew, of just search engine Antifa punching women.
[01:26:44.818 --> 01:26:50.260]  Hitting them in the head with bike locks, dragging them into crowds, beating them over the head with eggs, blooding their noses.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.701]  There's new ones every few days where men walk over and just punch women in the face.
[01:26:54.801 --> 01:26:56.781]  It's like they pick who they think is weak.
[01:26:56.881 --> 01:26:58.462]  Because I've been around Antifa, they don't...
[01:26:59.002 --> 01:27:04.607]  Other than sneaking up behind me and trying to hit me with clubs so I attack them so they can shoot me because they bring guns out here in Austin.
[01:27:05.668 --> 01:27:07.629]  They always seem to target who they think is weak.
[01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:10.612]  Yes, they always go after the weakest.
[01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:18.238]  And of course, when in a situation where we have, especially in San Francisco, where you have, you know, a few women and then there's a few men.
[01:27:18.258 --> 01:27:21.501]  The men, of course, are always going to try to be out there to protect the women.
[01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:23.582]  So when they go after the women, you know,
[01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:31.253]  Everyone kind of goes over to the woman or whoever is getting attacked, and then that also distracts other people, and then other people come in.
[01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:38.936]  I mean, it turns into like, well, as you saw, you can see it in the video, it turns into a brawl, you know, a brawl.
[01:27:39.016 --> 01:27:44.458]  And it's amazing that that encounter went on for probably a good five minutes.
[01:27:44.658 --> 01:27:46.079]  I mean, I don't know, I'm kind of guessing.
[01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:48.460]  And nobody, I mean, people stood around.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:54.422]  You can see in the background, you can see people walking by and just standing around and, you know, it's like,
[01:27:55.343 --> 01:28:01.787]  And even though they look like they're 4 to 1 to you, every time a woman or a man punches one, they run and more gang up.
[01:28:01.827 --> 01:28:03.748]  I mean, these are the archetypal wimps.
[01:28:04.169 --> 01:28:05.630]  Who attacks women?
[01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:07.471]  Everyone knows it's the bad guys.
[01:28:08.251 --> 01:28:09.232]  Right, right.
[01:28:09.372 --> 01:28:09.953]  And they do.
[01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:16.497]  They always go after the weaker ones, the women, or if they think there's a man that's weaker, they'll go after that man.
[01:28:17.518 --> 01:28:19.779]  For obvious reasons... I've seen them do it to people in wheelchairs.
[01:28:19.799 --> 01:28:20.360]  Let me ask you this.
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:23.122]  Don't they know they're summoning the whirlwind, though?
[01:28:25.485 --> 01:28:37.771]  I mean, I think that they should realize by now, I mean, what's happening is that you have people that are seeing this happen all across the country, and people are getting angry, and people are starting to get up and stand up, like what you saw in Portland.
[01:28:37.831 --> 01:28:42.334]  We had so many patriots out there in Portland, and as you see, I mean, we've
[01:28:43.641 --> 01:28:44.382]  We're not going to take it.
[01:28:44.842 --> 01:28:46.103]  We're not going to take this anymore.
[01:28:46.123 --> 01:28:48.945]  Which means the cowards are going to bring guns next.
[01:28:48.985 --> 01:28:50.246]  They got caught with guns by the way.
[01:28:50.306 --> 01:28:51.347]  That got hushed up in the news.
[01:28:51.707 --> 01:28:52.688]  So that's the problem.
[01:28:52.948 --> 01:28:55.710]  We'll be right back with Lindsey Grathwald.
[01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:56.111]  Stay with us.
[01:29:01.482 --> 01:29:08.745]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:29:09.145 --> 01:29:16.668]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:29:17.048 --> 01:29:20.149]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:29:20.769 --> 01:29:25.010]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:29.331]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:29:29.551 --> 01:29:32.272]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:29:32.692 --> 01:29:36.973]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:29:37.453 --> 01:29:40.514]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:29:40.914 --> 01:29:55.764]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:29:56.004 --> 01:29:57.305]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:59.787]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:30:01.283 --> 01:30:09.273]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.

[01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:10.716]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:31:10.916 --> 01:31:18.566]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:21.950]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:27.232]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:31:27.412 --> 01:31:29.954]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.

[01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:07.134]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:11.262]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[01:32:11.322 --> 01:32:14.908]  But we're gonna punch through the media.
[01:32:14.928 --> 01:32:15.690]  We have to!
[01:32:18.004 --> 01:32:23.626]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[01:32:23.646 --> 01:32:28.367]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:30.287]  We will not fail.
[01:32:31.588 --> 01:32:34.028]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[01:32:34.688 --> 01:32:36.089]  That whether we are black
[01:32:37.029 --> 01:32:38.890]  Or brown, or white.
[01:32:39.711 --> 01:32:43.613]  We all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[01:32:44.113 --> 01:32:47.375]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:50.877]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[01:32:51.237 --> 01:32:52.197]  Victory for the world.
[01:33:04.821 --> 01:33:07.542]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.246 --> 01:33:26.670]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.493 --> 01:33:33.297]  And that's why Hillary and Soros and the UN and the Democrats in Congress all say they want to shut down.
[01:33:33.357 --> 01:33:34.478]  It's on CNN Money today.
[01:33:34.958 --> 01:33:36.959]  Shut Infowars off in the First Amendment.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:42.924]  They got law firms, University of Georgetown, saying we want Jones taken off air.
[01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:45.606]  It's unbelievable.
[01:33:45.626 --> 01:33:47.668]  The lawyers, I've got it, said they've never seen anything like it.
[01:33:48.467 --> 01:33:52.408]  Now, Lindsey Grafwall's father was a great patriot, Green Beret.
[01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:55.468]  They tried to recruit him into the Weathermen.
[01:33:56.208 --> 01:34:01.189]  He got into the highest levels while they were conducting hundreds of bombings and later helped send him to prison.
[01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:05.750]  These, of course, were the mentors of Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:09.211]  And now we're facing this right now.
[01:34:09.331 --> 01:34:17.312]  And she was there in Portland two weeks ago and then in San Francisco this last weekend where they had a much smaller group and were attacked.
[01:34:18.331 --> 01:34:19.412]  By vicious antifa.
[01:34:20.772 --> 01:34:24.555]  And again, I would describe these prayer vigils as liberal conservative people that believe in free speech.
[01:34:25.175 --> 01:34:30.558]  I mean, after all, a transsexual was the person that actually called for the meeting for free speech.
[01:34:31.719 --> 01:34:34.300]  And so this is really waking a lot of people up.
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:39.123]  But she was issuing really a dire warning earlier about how they're reaping the whirlwind.
[01:34:39.143 --> 01:34:45.286]  But I think they're meant, they don't know what they're doing, they're being sent out with the Democrats on record, Soros funds them, to get conservatives mad to come out and be violent.
[01:34:45.466 --> 01:34:47.768]  That's why it's critical we not be offensively violent.
[01:34:48.228 --> 01:34:53.232]  Like they tried to do in Charlottesville by colliding the two groups, which were ant-alt-right.
[01:34:53.312 --> 01:34:54.132]  That's not what we are.
[01:34:54.793 --> 01:35:03.739]  But let's play a clip from her dad decades ago, talking about her late father, talking about the weather underground and things they openly were talking about.
[01:35:03.759 --> 01:35:04.220]  Here it is.
[01:35:05.521 --> 01:35:09.103]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[01:35:10.384 --> 01:35:15.768]  You know, we become responsible then for administrating, you know, 250 million people.
[01:35:18.925 --> 01:35:19.946]  And there was no answers.
[01:35:21.227 --> 01:35:23.269]  No one had given any thought to economics.
[01:35:24.450 --> 01:35:26.412]  How are you going to clothe and feed these people?
[01:35:27.573 --> 01:35:37.983]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States.
[01:35:39.124 --> 01:35:44.629]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[01:35:46.213 --> 01:36:07.767]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest, where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[01:36:08.668 --> 01:36:14.992]  I ask, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate, that are die-hard capitalists?
[01:36:16.088 --> 01:36:18.750]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[01:36:20.152 --> 01:36:27.958]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[01:36:28.598 --> 01:36:31.901]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:36:31.921 --> 01:36:32.562]  25 million people.
[01:36:33.483 --> 01:36:43.611]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia,
[01:36:44.628 --> 01:36:47.391]  And other well-known educational centers.
[01:36:48.211 --> 01:36:54.697]  And hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[01:36:55.137 --> 01:36:56.859]  And they were dead serious.
[01:36:58.854 --> 01:37:00.435]  Now, there is a new bill introduced.
[01:37:00.495 --> 01:37:02.076]  It's gotten almost no attention.
[01:37:02.096 --> 01:37:04.258]  The Epoch Times has reported on it.
[01:37:04.398 --> 01:37:05.578]  Unmasking Antifa Act.
[01:37:06.199 --> 01:37:08.420]  In-house proposed 15-year prison term.
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:16.766]  Under the act, anyone wearing a mask who injures, threatens, intimidates, or oppresses people in the free exercise of enjoyment of any right of privilege will be imprisoned up to 15 years.
[01:37:16.806 --> 01:37:21.669]  Will police blow their privilege when they unlawfully arrest or officially oppress?
[01:37:21.809 --> 01:37:23.230]  And they can serve five to ten.
[01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:24.651]  This is very reasonable.
[01:37:25.171 --> 01:37:26.352]  The bill proposed in the U.S.
[01:37:26.392 --> 01:37:32.634]  House of Representatives known as the Unmasking Antifa Act 2018 would seek to criminalize committing certain offenses while in disguise.
[01:37:32.654 --> 01:37:36.916]  I think it's a very good bill and it needs to be supported.
[01:37:36.936 --> 01:37:42.019]  It's got a lot of co-sponsors, but we need to move this through the House of Representatives right now.
[01:37:42.859 --> 01:37:45.160]  Lindsey Grathwald, give us your take on this.
[01:37:46.241 --> 01:37:47.101]  It's about time.
[01:37:48.061 --> 01:37:48.902]  It's about time.
[01:37:48.922 --> 01:37:51.483]  I absolutely, I mean,
[01:37:52.463 --> 01:37:53.484]  This needs to get passed.
[01:37:53.544 --> 01:37:59.071]  We need to get more people involved with this because it's getting, these attacks are getting worse.
[01:37:59.552 --> 01:38:06.860]  They are getting, when I was in Portland, there's bombs being thrown at us, which I mean we've had that happen before in Berkeley, but these were bigger.
[01:38:07.721 --> 01:38:19.289]  Um, in San Francisco, one of the things that we found out from the cops when they finally showed up was that these people that were, because there was an Occupy ICE protest down a few blocks down from where we were having the prayer vigil.
[01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:26.674]  And anyways, the cops told us that Antifa actually had, um, they, they described them as machetes.
[01:38:27.235 --> 01:38:27.575]  Okay.
[01:38:27.955 --> 01:38:31.318]  And so my question was, well, why can't you arrest them?
[01:38:31.418 --> 01:38:34.240]  Or, you know, how is that okay for them to be carrying around machetes?
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.001]  And they said, well, because it was in a sheath.
[01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:37.604]  That was okay.
[01:38:38.705 --> 01:38:41.065]  So, you know, it's only a matter of time.
[01:38:41.185 --> 01:38:43.266]  And we need to be able to identify these people.
[01:38:43.646 --> 01:38:48.208]  And these people that are committing these crimes against others need to be held accountable.
[01:38:48.228 --> 01:38:50.528]  And we can't do that if they're masked up.
[01:38:51.209 --> 01:38:55.350]  I mean, you know, there's many times when we're not able to identify these people and they get away with it.
[01:38:55.430 --> 01:39:04.973]  And so we absolutely need something in place so that these people, at the very least, if they're going to go out there, they're unmasked so that we know who they are and they can be held accountable.
[01:39:05.586 --> 01:39:10.928]  Let's be clear, MS-13 has been working with these folks, and they, their trademark's a machete.
[01:39:11.308 --> 01:39:20.832]  This is Austin, Owen Schroer tried to go to a vigil for the young woman killed in San Francisco by an illegal alien, and the virtue signaling jury said, that's fine, go ahead and kill her, no jail time.
[01:39:21.212 --> 01:39:22.592]  When he went, they said, are you scared, boy?
[01:39:22.612 --> 01:39:23.333]  You're not going in.
[01:39:23.353 --> 01:39:25.773]  They started hitting him with clubs, brandishing firearms.
[01:39:25.854 --> 01:39:27.674]  I mean, this is next level.
[01:39:27.714 --> 01:39:29.255]  And again, Blue City Police, Austin.
[01:39:29.935 --> 01:39:32.098]  The average cop isn't bad here, but they follow their orders.
[01:39:32.779 --> 01:39:36.665]  They were right there watching this trash engage in this activity.
[01:39:36.685 --> 01:39:37.526]  This is unbelievable.
[01:39:37.887 --> 01:39:43.996]  I would never do this, but if I was there with guys with AK-47s saying, you can't come on the park, the police would stop me and they should.
[01:39:45.037 --> 01:39:45.238]  Right.
[01:39:46.315 --> 01:39:47.636]  That's how it should be, right?
[01:39:47.776 --> 01:39:56.363]  I mean, and I don't understand why in these cities, I mean, especially up in Portland, and I've seen it in Berkeley, where the cops stand down.
[01:39:56.463 --> 01:40:02.548]  And in some cases, it even seems as though they're on the side of the Antifa side, Black Block.
[01:40:02.828 --> 01:40:03.869]  Oh, they're definitely.
[01:40:04.029 --> 01:40:06.391]  Did you see the documents we got this year from the brother?
[01:40:06.511 --> 01:40:08.393]  When his other brother got in trouble, he got the documents.
[01:40:08.413 --> 01:40:09.113]  It was all confirmed.
[01:40:09.654 --> 01:40:12.055]  Forty-something pages of George Soros' son
[01:40:12.957 --> 01:40:14.942]  Running in blue cities with the police.
[01:40:15.223 --> 01:40:15.925]  They go attack.
[01:40:15.985 --> 01:40:16.928]  They try to cause a riot.
[01:40:16.948 --> 01:40:18.091]  The police know where they're gonna hit.
[01:40:18.111 --> 01:40:20.297]  They're even allowed to like throw bottles at them and stuff.
[01:40:20.337 --> 01:40:20.919]  It's all staged.
[01:40:21.975 --> 01:40:23.096]  It's unbelievable.
[01:40:23.556 --> 01:40:24.637]  It's unbelievable.
[01:40:25.238 --> 01:40:26.279]  This is happening in America.
[01:40:26.659 --> 01:40:29.041]  In America, of all places, it's unbelievable.
[01:40:29.902 --> 01:40:32.864]  You brought up my father.
[01:40:33.144 --> 01:40:37.107]  These are things that my father talked about would happen.
[01:40:37.288 --> 01:40:42.492]  These are the foot soldiers that are out there shutting us down.
[01:40:44.455 --> 01:40:44.935]  I don't know.
[01:40:44.955 --> 01:40:46.056]  Let's be clear.
[01:40:46.116 --> 01:40:49.918]  Your father was there at the Weathermen at the ground floor and exposed them.
[01:40:50.299 --> 01:40:51.700]  Now the Weathermen are on top.
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:53.641]  The Antifa leaders are professors.
[01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.502]  And so this is the exact same movement.
[01:40:56.308 --> 01:41:03.711]  Bill Ayers, actually, it is confirmed, he was in Berkeley on April 15th when that big, huge riot happened.
[01:41:04.112 --> 01:41:11.655]  He was not on the street because he's a coward, but he was in the background helping everybody with signs and all that stuff.
[01:41:12.015 --> 01:41:16.577]  So yes, these people are very much, I mean, they're running the show.
[01:41:17.018 --> 01:41:17.978]  They're running the show.
[01:41:18.418 --> 01:41:23.901]  And this is what they wanted to do from the beginning, is cause this kind of stuff, chaos,
[01:41:24.528 --> 01:41:28.049]  You know, to eventually take over, I mean, the government.
[01:41:28.089 --> 01:41:31.930]  I mean, they want to basically take over the United States government.
[01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:33.591]  That is their ultimate goal.
[01:41:34.311 --> 01:41:40.773]  And right now, I mean, what's happening in the cities is just unbelievable to me.
[01:41:41.553 --> 01:41:48.695]  Like I said, it's almost like Twilight Zone stuff, because this is stuff when I'm out there, I'm like, sometimes it's hard for me to believe that I'm even in it.
[01:41:49.015 --> 01:41:52.536]  But what's it like to know that your dad was the first person to ever expose the entire plant?
[01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:55.635]  Well, that's even more crazy to me.
[01:41:55.695 --> 01:42:00.605]  Like, it's really sometimes I just, it's like a dream sometimes.
[01:42:00.625 --> 01:42:03.492]  Well, how proud do you think your dad is of you in heaven right now?
[01:42:04.341 --> 01:42:04.981]  I hope.
[01:42:05.141 --> 01:42:06.602]  I would hope that he's very proud.
[01:42:07.402 --> 01:42:08.842]  I'm sure that he would be upset.
[01:42:08.882 --> 01:42:10.282]  He wouldn't want me in harm's way.
[01:42:10.563 --> 01:42:11.623]  That would be the biggest thing.
[01:42:11.683 --> 01:42:14.784]  He wouldn't want me out there in harm's way, but I don't see any other choice.
[01:42:14.844 --> 01:42:19.085]  I mean, I feel like they are trying to shut us down at every single level.
[01:42:19.105 --> 01:42:23.806]  We're going to come back and talk about how we counterstrike, but take your dad.
[01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:24.506]  Notice he said,
[01:42:25.575 --> 01:42:27.417]  This is intel they documented and recorded.
[01:42:27.437 --> 01:42:29.499]  It was a critical understanding of a larger Chinese plan.
[01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:31.001]  They were funding the weather room, we now know.
[01:42:31.362 --> 01:42:34.966]  As they said, to foment the collapse of the border in the Southwest.
[01:42:35.546 --> 01:42:39.731]  Then there'd be an emergency for the government to build centers, but it wouldn't be for the illegals, it'd be for us.
[01:42:43.775 --> 01:42:44.937]  The President of the United States!
[01:42:44.997 --> 01:42:45.117]  The U.S.
[01:42:45.157 --> 01:42:45.838]  President is Donald Trump.
[01:42:48.388 --> 01:42:49.989]  Sorry, Globalist, you're in checkmate.
[01:42:50.349 --> 01:42:51.510]  Launch the final attacks.
[01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:52.850]  Information, that is.
[01:42:53.371 --> 01:42:59.474]  Tomorrow's news today, The Vaunted InfoWise.
[01:43:03.976 --> 01:43:06.098]  I've got a big announcement here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:06.118 --> 01:43:07.498]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[01:43:08.179 --> 01:43:08.499]  You saw...
[01:43:10.225 --> 01:43:18.687]  Dan Rather come out and, you know, demonize me and attack what we're doing here at Infowars and call us fake news.
[01:43:18.727 --> 01:43:20.028]  But, you know, he's the fake news.
[01:43:20.148 --> 01:43:26.009]  And he also recently came out and said that Trump is mean like a wolverine.
[01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:27.790]  So earlier this week, I said, hey,
[01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:31.292]  Let's put out Trump as a Wolverine.
[01:43:31.772 --> 01:43:34.674]  MeanLikeAWolverineInfoWars.com.
[01:43:34.734 --> 01:43:36.396]  Beautiful new red shirt.
[01:43:36.516 --> 01:43:38.677]  Incredible job with the graphics crew.
[01:43:38.757 --> 01:43:40.859]  They are amazing.
[01:43:40.879 --> 01:43:40.859]  1995.
[01:43:41.039 --> 01:43:41.979]  High quality shirt.
[01:43:42.119 --> 01:43:43.981]  It's being printed right now.
[01:43:44.101 --> 01:43:45.582]  They'll be shipping out next week.
[01:43:46.082 --> 01:43:47.223]  Get your order in.
[01:43:47.283 --> 01:43:48.443]  This is a limited edition.
[01:43:48.523 --> 01:43:50.784]  This needs to be the new viral shirt.
[01:43:50.864 --> 01:43:55.627]  Now, I think on another idea today, we've got printing right here in Texas now, so we can get this by next week as well.
[01:43:56.107 --> 01:44:01.449]  I just put in a giant order because I saw Walmart boycott launched over Impeach 45 clothing.
[01:44:01.489 --> 01:44:03.090]  Don't boycott Walmart over that.
[01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:04.171]  Just say Walmart.
[01:44:04.891 --> 01:44:06.192]  I don't care if they copy our shirt.
[01:44:06.312 --> 01:44:07.392]  Put out a reelect 45.
[01:44:09.113 --> 01:44:10.713]  You know, let's engage in that.
[01:44:10.793 --> 01:44:11.914]  So, they've got their Impeach45.
[01:44:12.114 --> 01:44:14.254]  You go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:14.294 --> 01:44:19.996]  We have Reelect45 with an American flag, very triggering, on the right arm and on the back.
[01:44:20.436 --> 01:44:21.576]  Infowars.com.
[01:44:22.296 --> 01:44:24.917]  I am the resistance.
[01:44:26.237 --> 01:44:28.218]  I am the resistance.
[01:44:29.558 --> 01:44:31.359]  This, I mean, these shirts have just been hitting me.
[01:44:31.419 --> 01:44:32.819]  And I'm new, Hillary for prison.
[01:44:33.619 --> 01:44:36.620]  I saw a handmade sign in a yard.
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.961]  About, you know, like three years before the election.
[01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:42.281]  They knew she'd run.
[01:44:42.341 --> 01:44:45.441]  And then I remember thinking, or two years before, I thought, we've got to do that.
[01:44:45.541 --> 01:44:49.042]  And we went to the RNC, and a third of the people were wearing it.
[01:44:49.102 --> 01:44:49.862]  It was The Chance.
[01:44:51.323 --> 01:44:53.603]  We had planes flying around saying it behind them.
[01:44:53.643 --> 01:44:54.363]  It was incredible.
[01:44:54.383 --> 01:44:55.143]  It was a magic moment.
[01:44:55.684 --> 01:44:57.464]  And I know when something's going to be a hit.
[01:44:58.124 --> 01:45:04.145]  So they've got their Impeach 45, re-elect 45, baseball shirt style, white, blue, and red.
[01:45:04.445 --> 01:45:05.025]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:45:05.245 --> 01:45:07.306]  And then black on white, I am the resistance.
[01:45:08.326 --> 01:45:09.547]  It's an awesome shirt.
[01:45:10.067 --> 01:45:09.547]  $19.95.
[01:45:10.407 --> 01:45:12.168]  High quality fabric.
[01:45:12.208 --> 01:45:13.028]  Made right here in America.
[01:45:13.088 --> 01:45:13.788]  Printed in America.
[01:45:13.808 --> 01:45:16.769]  So, you know, it's costing six, seven bucks to do that in America.
[01:45:16.789 --> 01:45:18.050]  We do it for three bucks in Mexico.
[01:45:18.450 --> 01:45:19.070]  So it's there.
[01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:20.471]  Help fund the operation.
[01:45:20.551 --> 01:45:20.971]  Reelect45.
[01:45:20.991 --> 01:45:21.711]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:45:30.334 --> 01:45:33.496]  These shirts are both so good, I don't know which one's gonna be a bestseller.
[01:45:33.556 --> 01:45:39.420]  And right through the 4th of July, free shipping across the store, 50% off Rainforest, which we just went out and said, what are the top new trophies?

[01:47:59.996 --> 01:48:02.337]  And thank God we're dropping bombs on them, in truth.

[01:48:05.484 --> 01:48:08.905]  I was just asking our guest here, Ms.
[01:48:08.925 --> 01:48:10.106]  Grathwald, how we support her.
[01:48:10.186 --> 01:48:11.246]  She goes, well, there's no real way.
[01:48:11.266 --> 01:48:11.986]  I haven't really thought of that.
[01:48:12.026 --> 01:48:22.490]  I just work during the day and I go out and, you know, all over the West Coast and drive for sometimes half a day to stand up at prayer vigils and watch women and children be hit over the head with bike locks and be punched in the face.
[01:48:22.530 --> 01:48:25.751]  But Lindsey Grathwald on Facebook, everybody should follow her there.
[01:48:25.811 --> 01:48:28.912]  Facebook's calling for us all to be banned because we're fake news.
[01:48:30.092 --> 01:48:32.073]  We go out and show Antifa punching women in the face.
[01:48:32.093 --> 01:48:34.914]  That's fake news because Antifa are sweet little meth heads.
[01:48:35.894 --> 01:48:41.496]  So, Mike Cernovich joins us at the bottom of the next hour to get into the move to ban Antifa when they wear masks and commit crimes.
[01:48:42.176 --> 01:48:43.176]  That's all coming up.
[01:48:43.196 --> 01:48:48.418]  Just briefly, this was developed
[01:48:50.054 --> 01:48:59.883]  And is even authorized and FDA cleared is the term they like to use, but it's been through the FDA process for over-the-counter sale.
[01:49:00.944 --> 01:49:07.771]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver that is used in hospitals.
[01:49:08.732 --> 01:49:12.956]  And this silver, which I can't even do justice to, is
[01:49:16.998 --> 01:49:19.460]  $40 in stores or online or $40 to hospitals.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:20.561]  We private label it.
[01:49:20.601 --> 01:49:26.345]  We can sell it for $40 if we want because there's a lot of money that went into getting FDA clearance.
[01:49:26.446 --> 01:49:28.908]  This is private label from the big company that has FDA clearance.
[01:49:30.069 --> 01:49:38.895]  And it's got a big, giant breakdown that is so complex with the lawyers and all the rest of it that I don't even feel like I could even go over it.
[01:49:39.475 --> 01:49:40.116]  Let me just say this.
[01:49:40.196 --> 01:49:41.336]  It's nanotech silver.
[01:49:41.817 --> 01:49:45.439]  It is not for internal use because silver is toxic when it's done at this nano level.
[01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:46.400]  But let me tell you.
[01:49:47.649 --> 01:49:52.430]  For athletes, for people that have cuts, things on their skin, it is the next level.
[01:49:53.290 --> 01:50:03.172]  It is super silver wound dressing gel, trademarked for first aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and second degree burns, skin irritations.
[01:50:03.753 --> 01:50:06.093]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[01:50:06.193 --> 01:50:08.514]  Some medical grade stores have it.
[01:50:08.914 --> 01:50:09.694]  It's sold on average for $40.
[01:50:11.741 --> 01:50:13.903]  Because believe me, it's expensive for each tube for us.
[01:50:13.963 --> 01:50:14.663]  It's a big tube.
[01:50:15.143 --> 01:50:15.624]  Four ounce.
[01:50:16.924 --> 01:50:22.228]  And I actually, I'm on the phone with lawyers and scientists today because I want to get this exactly right.
[01:50:23.609 --> 01:50:24.809]  When we say what we can say.
[01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:28.052]  I've got an approved breakdown on super silver wound dressing gel.
[01:50:29.546 --> 01:50:55.960]  uh... and it's it's just incredible it is the numbers twenty four hundred the stuff that's prescriptions thirty two hundred uh... it's nanotech it's from the only company that has it's a big company I don't mind if I say their name but I'm about to lower the price of it so I'm not going to do it uh... the contract we have there isn't a map pricing it's nine it's it's it's twenty nine ninety five out of the gates twenty nine ninety five
[01:50:57.077 --> 01:50:57.777]  Super silver.
[01:50:57.797 --> 01:50:59.077]  This is not colloidal silver.
[01:50:59.097 --> 01:51:00.058]  This is not any of that.
[01:51:00.098 --> 01:51:02.498]  This is nanotech small silver.
[01:51:02.518 --> 01:51:06.479]  And I'm going to tell you again, it is not for internal use.
[01:51:08.019 --> 01:51:11.660]  But when all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:13.400]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.741]  And I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:51:17.661 --> 01:51:21.062]  He still has his license, but he doesn't really practice dentistry anymore.
[01:51:22.662 --> 01:51:26.323]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals.
[01:51:27.492 --> 01:51:31.194]  And he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world.
[01:51:31.295 --> 01:51:32.275]  It turned out they're listeners.
[01:51:33.336 --> 01:51:35.537]  And so a major scientist owns it.
[01:51:35.657 --> 01:51:36.378]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:51:36.758 --> 01:51:38.259]  We may even have him in studio and do the whole thing.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:41.501]  But it's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics.
[01:51:41.541 --> 01:51:43.743]  And it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[01:51:44.663 --> 01:51:48.666]  They use another solution they've developed of nanotech to flush the lines at dental offices.
[01:51:49.166 --> 01:51:50.907]  Let me just say, this is next level.
[01:51:50.947 --> 01:51:52.468]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[01:51:52.488 --> 01:51:55.790]  And I've got a whole big list here in my stack of what is FDA,
[01:51:58.432 --> 01:51:58.812]  What's the term?
[01:51:58.832 --> 01:52:00.754]  I'm supposed to say approved because they never approved something.
[01:52:01.254 --> 01:52:09.800]  FDA cleared of what it knocks out and it's incredible, but for a week I've been trying to like get exactly what I can say about it, but it is the nuclear option.
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:11.241]  Okay, I'm gonna tell you again.
[01:52:11.481 --> 01:52:17.625]  Do not take this internally because it kills bacteria and viruses deader than a hammer.
[01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:19.246]  Like, boom!
[01:52:20.187 --> 01:52:23.369]  So, if it ain't good for them, it ain't good for you.
[01:52:24.619 --> 01:52:26.980]  But, if it's going to eat your leg off, it's a nuclear option.
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:36.223]  So, this is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared, is the term, FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[01:52:38.464 --> 01:52:42.065]  Like, we're coming out with an energy thing that is like the strongest thing out there.
[01:52:42.085 --> 01:52:43.525]  It's going to have warnings on the label, okay?
[01:52:44.426 --> 01:52:45.446]  But you want it, you got it.
[01:52:45.846 --> 01:52:53.029]  This is, without a prescription, just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega
[01:52:54.196 --> 01:52:58.059]  Silver, that is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:52:59.980]  Super silver.
[01:53:01.161 --> 01:53:03.662]  Private labeled, $10 off what it's sold for.
[01:53:03.682 --> 01:53:07.325]  M4store.com, M4isLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:53:07.385 --> 01:53:09.246]  And let's just say this, it's amazing.
[01:53:09.847 --> 01:53:13.669]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:53:14.490 --> 01:53:15.610]  That's how you fund our operation.
[01:53:15.630 --> 01:53:16.831]  We have a limited run of these.
[01:53:18.075 --> 01:53:21.881]  And let's just say it's very expensive for us to get because they went through the FDA approval.
[01:53:22.161 --> 01:53:23.243]  It's been approved for four years.
[01:53:23.563 --> 01:53:29.011]  We're now in the FDA cleared list of companies that can... There's only one other company that sells this.
[01:53:29.291 --> 01:53:30.994]  We are the only private labeler of it.
[01:53:31.988 --> 01:53:34.569]  And that's because Infowars has a lot of friends, a lot of enemies, too.
[01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:35.609]  This is it.
[01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:42.730]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:47.551]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[01:53:47.911 --> 01:53:48.411]  This is it.
[01:53:49.351 --> 01:53:51.792]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[01:53:52.512 --> 01:53:53.372]  This is it right here.
[01:53:53.432 --> 01:53:55.173]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[01:53:56.373 --> 01:53:56.833]  Nanotech.
[01:53:58.061 --> 01:54:00.522]  Super small particles, which go in electromagnetically.
[01:54:01.023 --> 01:54:02.103]  Well, you know what silver does.
[01:54:02.163 --> 01:54:05.025]  It just goes right into the heart of something and it's gone.
[01:54:05.045 --> 01:54:05.986]  All right.
[01:54:06.326 --> 01:54:08.047]  This segment, the next, I apologize to our guest.
[01:54:08.087 --> 01:54:08.587]  I'm ranting.
[01:54:09.127 --> 01:54:12.069]  Lindsey Grathwell, you've got the floor to talk about any other great points you want to make.
[01:54:12.429 --> 01:54:16.472]  Being attacked out there by Antifa, where this is going, what you expect to happen next.
[01:54:16.712 --> 01:54:17.012]  Go ahead.
[01:54:18.594 --> 01:54:29.523]  Well, I want to talk about we, so I'm sure everyone's aware there's going to be a march up in Portland on August 4th with Patriot Prayer, Joey Gibson, and I'm hoping to make it up there myself.
[01:54:30.043 --> 01:54:41.652]  But on August 5th, we are working together with Joey Gibson and Patriot Prayer, myself and Amber Cummings, who is the transsexual woman that was out there with us on Saturday.
[01:54:41.712 --> 01:54:46.156]  We are having a No to Marxism event that we've been planning now for a couple months.
[01:54:46.776 --> 01:54:48.057]  In Berkeley, California.
[01:54:48.498 --> 01:54:52.881]  So literally we're going to be having, you know, we're going to go up to Portland.
[01:54:52.901 --> 01:54:54.122]  We're going to do our thing up there.
[01:54:54.302 --> 01:55:00.087]  And then Joey and a bunch of Patriots from up there, we're going to literally caravan back to Berkeley for the next day.
[01:55:00.107 --> 01:55:02.108]  And we're going to go stand in Berkeley.
[01:55:03.570 --> 01:55:05.831]  Part of it is going to be in honor of my father.
[01:55:06.412 --> 01:55:09.895]  We were supposed to have an event, you know, that was going to be totally for my dad on August 4th.
[01:55:10.675 --> 01:55:16.977]  We decided that because Joey's having his event that we're going to do the one in Portland and then we're going to do one in Berkeley.
[01:55:17.417 --> 01:55:19.597]  So together, Amber and I are working on that.
[01:55:20.057 --> 01:55:20.997]  We have some speakers.
[01:55:21.037 --> 01:55:22.798]  Joey Gibson is going to be coming to speak.
[01:55:25.999 --> 01:55:28.299]  Her Skype just froze up for a moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:28.319 --> 01:55:30.600]  Again, we're going to give you her Facebook and more.
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:32.280]  This lady needs you to come out and support her.
[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:39.542]  I've been really asked by a lot of patriots in the government not to go to events because there is, without getting into too many details,
[01:55:42.076 --> 01:55:43.758]  Well, you know, they're known as contracts out.
[01:55:44.398 --> 01:55:47.141]  But at the same time, you just can't sit here and watch these people do this alone.
[01:55:47.502 --> 01:55:49.444]  We need numbers out there just like Portland.
[01:55:49.724 --> 01:55:50.585]  How do people join you again?
[01:55:53.283 --> 01:55:56.685]  Hey, you can just come on to my Facebook page and you can follow me.
[01:55:56.705 --> 01:56:02.107]  I put all the information to all the events that we're doing on my Facebook page.
[01:56:02.988 --> 01:56:04.509]  We've been talking about this for a while.
[01:56:04.549 --> 01:56:10.011]  We tried to do a Patriot Weekend last year in August in the Bay Area.
[01:56:10.411 --> 01:56:13.753]  I don't know if you remember, Alex, but it got crazy.
[01:56:13.793 --> 01:56:16.014]  We actually had to cancel our event in San Francisco.
[01:56:16.514 --> 01:56:20.457]  Because Nancy Pelosi and all the politicians in San Francisco... She calls you all Nazis!
[01:56:20.897 --> 01:56:24.780]  Yeah, and I mean literally, I mean, they put us in a dangerous... they set us up.
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:33.906]  They put us in a situation... But that's when Antifa folded nationwide, and they admitted Trump was right about it being bad, and when Pelosi had to then say, and the mayor and police chief say, Antifa is evil.
[01:56:34.166 --> 01:56:38.289]  So your courage... I'm not just saying it, your courage turned the tide.
[01:56:39.414 --> 01:56:50.439]  Yeah, and we were, I mean it was an ugly weekend because we had the San Francisco thing and then Berkeley we had the next day, which I went to Berkeley and there's videos of, I mean that was just a mess in Berkeley.
[01:56:50.739 --> 01:56:54.461]  There were thousands of Antifa in Berkeley that day that were beating up reporters.
[01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:57.905]  They were beating up, you know, I mean they were beating up anybody that they thought.
[01:56:57.926 --> 01:56:59.007]  And that's why it backfired.
[01:56:59.027 --> 01:57:00.709]  For those who don't remember, let's come back and talk about that.
[01:57:00.729 --> 01:57:02.292]  They went mad dogs.
[01:57:02.332 --> 01:57:03.854]  They had such a big crowd for the first time.
[01:57:04.174 --> 01:57:08.360]  They were attacking black people, white people, liberals, reporters, police.
[01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:10.703]  It was like just like crazy mad dogs.
[01:57:11.448 --> 01:57:12.268]  Yeah, they did.
[01:57:12.388 --> 01:57:17.351]  And then our politicians here had to come out and call them what they were.
[01:57:17.371 --> 01:57:20.912]  And they've been here in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[01:57:20.992 --> 01:57:24.874]  They've been what I've been saying, they've been in hibernation for a little while.
[01:57:25.334 --> 01:57:27.175]  But we did an event not long ago.
[01:57:27.235 --> 01:57:31.477]  We went into Oakland, of all places, and there was a coffee shop there called Austin Huerta.
[01:57:32.037 --> 01:57:34.038]  And they refused to serve police officers.
[01:57:34.438 --> 01:57:35.979]  So we went down there to protest them.
[01:57:36.019 --> 01:57:37.279]  I was with Will Johnson.
[01:57:37.599 --> 01:57:38.059]  Stay there.
[01:57:38.139 --> 01:57:39.940]  Back in two minutes we'll finish up with you.
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:41.260]  Mike Cernovich coming up.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.201]  Infowars.com.
[01:57:56.288 --> 01:58:01.912]  When you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[01:58:02.953 --> 01:58:06.336]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:58:06.736 --> 01:58:15.142]  It is you, the Infowarriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:58:15.483 --> 01:58:19.726]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:58:20.046 --> 01:58:20.967]  You are the Infowar.
[01:58:21.487 --> 01:58:25.030]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:58:25.711 --> 01:58:37.300]  Then everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:47.248]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:58:47.748 --> 01:58:47.948]  I think?
[01:59:07.557 --> 01:59:10.639]  Our following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[01:59:10.999 --> 01:59:13.081]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:13.561 --> 01:59:18.504]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is or what sex we are or where we came from.
[01:59:19.065 --> 01:59:26.730]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:27.230 --> 01:59:33.934]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:59:34.255 --> 01:59:35.635]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:36.556 --> 01:59:37.096]  We are the future.
[01:59:37.116 --> 01:59:37.616]  We are the renaissance.
[01:59:37.797 --> 01:59:38.217]  And we are winning.
[01:59:38.237 --> 01:59:41.318]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.232 --> 02:00:24.414]  Lindsey Grathwald is on Facebook for now.
[02:00:24.474 --> 02:00:25.535]  They're trying to censor everybody.
[02:00:25.695 --> 02:00:28.217]  She's only got 2,770 followers.
[02:00:28.817 --> 02:00:30.098]  She's an amazing patriot.
[02:00:30.118 --> 02:00:32.479]  Her father was a great American, lives on with his family.
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:47.129]  And she's out there in California, in Oregon, in Washington State, driving on her own dime, and going out there, and sometimes just seven, eight, nine of them, being attacked by 1520 Antifa.
[02:00:49.682 --> 02:00:50.623]  It's incredible.
[02:00:50.663 --> 02:00:53.904]  So I want men and women to come out in support of what she's doing.
[02:00:54.605 --> 02:00:57.146]  So again, we thought we found a GoFundMe online.
[02:00:57.166 --> 02:00:58.027]  I don't know if that's yours.
[02:00:58.107 --> 02:01:04.750]  We did a GoFundMe for one of the guys that got charged a while back during that whole riot in San Francisco, even the Washington Post.
[02:01:05.190 --> 02:01:08.392]  And if it started, there's a Larry Graffold story.
[02:01:09.032 --> 02:01:09.493]  You want to raise $8,000.
[02:01:09.553 --> 02:01:10.994]  Is that you?
[02:01:11.034 --> 02:01:12.975]  We're just searching how to support you at GoFundMe.
[02:01:13.015 --> 02:01:13.315]  Is that you?
[02:01:14.226 --> 02:01:14.706]  That is me.
[02:01:14.806 --> 02:01:16.227]  I actually created that a while back.
[02:01:16.267 --> 02:01:17.007]  Yeah, that is me.
[02:01:17.307 --> 02:01:18.227]  Well, that's a shame.
[02:01:18.307 --> 02:01:18.807]  That's a shame.
[02:01:18.867 --> 02:01:21.188]  People need to make your $8,000 goal right now.
[02:01:21.248 --> 02:01:26.789]  I'm going to make... He was not made out of money, but I gave $10,000 a few days ago to the JustWalkAway guy.
[02:01:26.809 --> 02:01:30.571]  Believe me, we're under a major attack, but it's the seed money of people taking action.
[02:01:30.931 --> 02:01:34.592]  I'm going to make a $5,000 donation today.
[02:01:34.732 --> 02:01:35.652]  Folks, make sure it happens.
[02:01:35.692 --> 02:01:37.332]  Go tell the accounting.
[02:01:37.632 --> 02:01:40.513]  $5,000 donation right now, but I want to see it go to $8,000 today.
[02:01:41.033 --> 02:01:42.514]  I want to see listers come in for the other $3,000.
[02:01:44.042 --> 02:01:45.423]  Wow, thank you so much.
[02:01:45.443 --> 02:01:46.524]  That's really awesome, Alex.
[02:01:46.624 --> 02:01:47.164]  Thank you.
[02:01:47.264 --> 02:01:47.945]  Are you kidding?
[02:01:48.025 --> 02:01:52.408]  I mean, I've got my intel sources and stuff saying don't go out to these events because I'm a target.
[02:01:52.428 --> 02:01:54.790]  I mean, you're out there fighting the scum of the earth.
[02:01:55.311 --> 02:02:02.616]  So the least I can do is support to give a woman gas money and funding and things to get organized to go out and challenge scum.
[02:02:02.997 --> 02:02:05.739]  My God, if men won't do the job, we're going to send the women.
[02:02:05.759 --> 02:02:07.260]  I might as well give you the money to do it.
[02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:09.330]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.971]  I really do.
[02:02:09.991 --> 02:02:16.013]  Because we do... I mean, I've been this year, I've been... Me, a man, giving a woman money to go fight globalist scum?
[02:02:16.033 --> 02:02:19.194]  I mean, it's actually kind of shameful that we don't have more men out there.
[02:02:19.214 --> 02:02:21.015]  If there was a man doing it, I'd give him the money.
[02:02:21.095 --> 02:02:22.055]  Okay, well, okay.
[02:02:22.395 --> 02:02:23.735]  Just for my conscience, I'm doing it.
[02:02:24.096 --> 02:02:24.936]  You understand that, right?
[02:02:25.828 --> 02:02:27.369]  I do, and I appreciate it.
[02:02:27.389 --> 02:02:28.990]  I mean, I travel.
[02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:31.692]  This year I've been to Oregon, I think, three different times.
[02:02:32.073 --> 02:02:33.033]  I've been to Arizona.
[02:02:33.053 --> 02:02:34.394]  I got to speak in Arizona.
[02:02:34.755 --> 02:02:38.377]  I flew to New York to be in a documentary about Antifa.
[02:02:38.397 --> 02:02:41.199]  Point is, you're taking action, so tell folks what donations can do for you.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.102]  Oh, it'll help me get from one event to another.
[02:02:45.182 --> 02:02:50.386]  I mean, that's all I do is, you know, on my free time, I work 40 hours a week.
[02:02:50.606 --> 02:02:51.847]  So I work a regular job.
[02:02:51.887 --> 02:02:52.608]  I have two kids.
[02:02:53.069 --> 02:02:56.411]  You know, I have a family, so it's like, this is like what I do in my extra time.
[02:02:56.751 --> 02:03:03.254]  And by the way, I'm going to hold you up if I'm interrupting, but biologically as a father, it's really hard for me now to put myself in danger.
[02:03:03.274 --> 02:03:05.595]  It's not even fear, it's fear of not being there for my kids.
[02:03:06.035 --> 02:03:08.636]  I have less fear as a parent, but now I have concern about them.
[02:03:08.676 --> 02:03:14.379]  So you're a mother on top of it, facing violent, trashy, scum that attack women with bike locks.
[02:03:14.799 --> 02:03:15.439]  That's amazing.
[02:03:15.459 --> 02:03:17.240]  So again, how do people go to the GoFundMe and donate?
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:19.501]  It's on the GoFundMe.
[02:03:19.882 --> 02:03:21.563]  It's under my name, Lindsey Grathwald.
[02:03:21.884 --> 02:03:23.145]  You can donate there.
[02:03:23.165 --> 02:03:25.648]  I'd appreciate all the help I can get.
[02:03:26.188 --> 02:03:27.149]  And Alex, you know what?
[02:03:27.409 --> 02:03:30.693]  About that, you know, I feel like, I guess I'm a lot like my father.
[02:03:30.833 --> 02:03:34.837]  Like, I feel like I cannot sit back and watch all this happen and not do anything.
[02:03:35.357 --> 02:03:36.999]  I do worry about my children.
[02:03:37.059 --> 02:03:38.680]  I worry that something might happen to me.
[02:03:38.981 --> 02:03:41.963]  But my dad put himself in the same situation, you know.
[02:03:42.224 --> 02:03:53.174]  And I worry about more what's going to happen to my kids in a country that is, you know, taken over by Marxist communists when I'm not here anymore to help them.
[02:03:53.534 --> 02:03:54.555]  That is the key.
[02:03:54.655 --> 02:03:57.177]  Every time I feel guilty about what I'm doing.
[02:03:57.658 --> 02:03:59.960]  We're going to lose it all anyways if we don't go all in.
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:00.841]  Exactly.
[02:04:01.596 --> 02:04:01.796]  Yep.
[02:04:02.156 --> 02:04:02.957]  And that's where I'm at.
[02:04:03.037 --> 02:04:04.318]  And that's why I'm doing what I do.
[02:04:04.398 --> 02:04:08.360]  And my family, you know, my mom sometimes cries because she knows.
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:10.141]  She knows what my dad went through.
[02:04:10.481 --> 02:04:11.542]  She knows what I go through.
[02:04:11.662 --> 02:04:14.484]  And she doesn't want that, you know, anything bad to happen to me.
[02:04:14.904 --> 02:04:16.345]  But I feel driven.
[02:04:16.405 --> 02:04:19.047]  Like, this is, this is, I mean, this is so important.
[02:04:19.127 --> 02:04:20.427]  And I'm doing it for my kids.
[02:04:20.608 --> 02:04:23.069]  The answer, and your mom's great, is she needs to get involved.
[02:04:23.569 --> 02:04:25.611]  Everybody sees people like you targeted and bullied.
[02:04:25.851 --> 02:04:26.911]  We have to all get involved.
[02:04:26.951 --> 02:04:27.612]  That's the answer.
[02:04:28.854 --> 02:04:29.454]  We have to.
[02:04:29.534 --> 02:04:30.535]  And we have to stand up.
[02:04:30.995 --> 02:04:32.516]  And we have to tell them, no.
[02:04:32.676 --> 02:04:34.458]  I mean, we're not going to allow this to happen.
[02:04:34.478 --> 02:04:36.139]  We're not going to allow them to take over.
[02:04:36.619 --> 02:04:42.323]  And we are not going to stand by and let them go out and shut down our freedom of speech.
[02:04:42.363 --> 02:04:42.763]  You're right.
[02:04:42.823 --> 02:04:43.243]  Stay there.
[02:04:43.303 --> 02:04:45.905]  Let's come back with a few more comments from you ahead of Mike Cernovich.
[02:04:46.125 --> 02:04:51.028]  Stay with us.
[02:04:51.688 --> 02:04:52.889]  Vaporizing globalists.
[02:04:54.730 --> 02:04:55.391]  Bringing victory.
[02:04:58.188 --> 02:05:00.290]  You are the resistance.
[02:05:01.931 --> 02:05:05.713]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:05:06.074 --> 02:05:12.718]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[02:05:13.179 --> 02:05:17.742]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[02:05:18.022 --> 02:05:24.947]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[02:05:25.367 --> 02:05:31.056]  That will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[02:05:31.417 --> 02:05:40.571]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[02:05:41.031 --> 02:05:48.178]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[02:05:48.539 --> 02:06:01.372]  Head to infowarrestore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[02:06:02.773 --> 02:06:03.974]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:04.034 --> 02:06:05.876]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:52.872]  All right, I've got a raft of clips from the incredible testimony of Strzok and Orr and others today in Congress.
[02:06:53.573 --> 02:06:56.054]  And I've been ranting here because this stuff gets me so wound up.
[02:06:56.474 --> 02:06:58.755]  Lindsey Grathwald, daughter of Larry Grathwald, is our guest.
[02:06:58.775 --> 02:07:03.656]  She goes out and faces antifa, usually 10, 15, 20 of them get attacked by a whole bunch of them.
[02:07:03.676 --> 02:07:05.177]  Then later, patriots come out.
[02:07:05.217 --> 02:07:12.520]  But it just shows, even here in Austin, we try to go cover a pro-gun rally now, and we'll be met on the street by guys with guns saying, you can't come in.
[02:07:13.701 --> 02:07:15.346]  It's just insane.
[02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:19.298]  Other points you want to impart to folks, Lindsey?
[02:07:20.698 --> 02:07:27.841]  The main thing, I mean, right now we just, we really want to get, you know, anyone that can come out and support us up in Berkeley, California on August 5th.
[02:07:28.321 --> 02:07:30.622]  You know, we definitely want to get people out there.
[02:07:30.682 --> 02:07:32.723]  Like you said earlier, it's numbers.
[02:07:33.143 --> 02:07:40.325]  We need people out there to support us because they come out in droves and, I mean, we've seen it multiple times.
[02:07:41.306 --> 02:07:44.407]  Portland's probably the most recent one that was a complete
[02:07:45.046 --> 02:07:45.486]  Right.
[02:07:46.527 --> 02:07:48.448]  And we'll be going back up to Portland again, too.
[02:07:48.508 --> 02:07:52.671]  I mean, I was hoping, you know, to hopefully make it up there and I'm planning on it.
[02:07:53.231 --> 02:07:56.834]  So and then after that, you know, we we're just going to keep on pushing.
[02:07:56.874 --> 02:07:58.014]  We keep on doing events.
[02:07:58.395 --> 02:07:59.735]  We're not going to let them silent us.
[02:07:59.795 --> 02:08:05.179]  In fact, the more that they push back at us, the more that we're going to come out and we're going to keep on having our events.
[02:08:05.666 --> 02:08:07.888]  Because we feel like we have to.
[02:08:07.908 --> 02:08:13.092]  The minute we stand down and get silent is the minute that they win.
[02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:17.375]  And we can't let that happen because there's way too much at stake.
[02:08:17.515 --> 02:08:19.337]  And like I said earlier, it's about my kids.
[02:08:19.857 --> 02:08:21.639]  It's about the future for my kids.
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:28.864]  My son has gotten issues simply because he's conservative, like me.
[02:08:28.904 --> 02:08:29.845]  He's 11 years old.
[02:08:30.566 --> 02:08:34.909]  And that's only going to get worse if we allow this kind of stuff to happen.
[02:08:36.762 --> 02:08:44.388]  So, I mean, August 4th up in Portland, August 5th in Berkeley, those are two big events that we're going to be having, and I hope that people come out.
[02:08:44.688 --> 02:08:52.695]  I know not everybody can, and I know not everybody wants to because they're afraid, you know, but I want people to understand, you know, it is scary.
[02:08:52.935 --> 02:08:53.976]  It is scary.
[02:08:54.036 --> 02:08:58.239]  I get scared too, but we have to stand up for what we believe in.
[02:08:58.259 --> 02:08:59.300]  I mean, we have to.
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:00.901]  Otherwise, we're going to lose it.
[02:09:02.130 --> 02:09:03.912]  And to me, that's becoming a reality.
[02:09:03.972 --> 02:09:12.498]  Like, I'm seeing all of our, the rights that we have, you know, everything is slowly being taken away from us.
[02:09:12.838 --> 02:09:14.560]  And especially living here in California.
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:20.464]  I mean, I'm in California and they are, I mean, I live in a, I call it commie-fornia.
[02:09:20.864 --> 02:09:21.905]  It's a communist state.
[02:09:23.386 --> 02:09:27.349]  And that is, it's slowly happening around the rest of the country.
[02:09:27.469 --> 02:09:28.110]  And eventually,
[02:09:28.650 --> 02:09:29.351]  It's going to hit you.
[02:09:29.451 --> 02:09:33.234]  And I tell people all the time, don't wait until it comes to your doorstep.
[02:09:33.574 --> 02:09:35.896]  You got to get out there and you got to fight somehow.
[02:09:36.016 --> 02:09:40.200]  If you don't want to get in the street, then get involved somehow, some way.
[02:09:41.423 --> 02:09:46.305]  You know, to do something that, you know, maybe get, you know, politically get involved.
[02:09:46.625 --> 02:09:48.206]  I don't know how people want to do it.
[02:09:48.226 --> 02:09:56.269]  The bottom line is, the fight for this country with foreign corporations and the Chinese communists admittedly owning Hollywood, this country is fighting for its life right now.
[02:09:56.829 --> 02:09:58.450]  And we really appreciate what you're doing.
[02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.990]  We want to support you.
[02:09:59.010 --> 02:10:01.811]  I'm going to make that donation to your GoFundMe.
[02:10:01.911 --> 02:10:02.951]  Everybody should do it right now.
[02:10:02.991 --> 02:10:05.952]  They just got to GoFundMe and type in the Larry Grafwald story.
[02:10:06.453 --> 02:10:09.674]  Grafwald is G-R-A-T-H-W-O-H.
[02:10:10.254 --> 02:10:10.554]  Hell.
[02:10:11.094 --> 02:10:11.495]  Story.
[02:10:11.975 --> 02:10:13.656]  And we really appreciate you and God bless you.
[02:10:13.696 --> 02:10:14.456]  We appreciate your courage.
[02:10:14.996 --> 02:10:15.757]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:15.817 --> 02:10:17.057]  I appreciate you having me on.
[02:10:17.297 --> 02:10:17.698]  Thank you.
[02:10:18.138 --> 02:10:24.281]  And listeners, I know I go to you each day and say, support our local radio stations, support InfoWars, support this guest.
[02:10:24.661 --> 02:10:26.121]  It's whatever you feel called to support.
[02:10:26.161 --> 02:10:26.702]  Just know this.
[02:10:27.782 --> 02:10:29.003]  We understand the cost.
[02:10:29.163 --> 02:10:33.565]  We've put ourselves on the line because what's coming is far worse than what we're currently in.
[02:10:34.798 --> 02:10:36.379]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[02:10:37.259 --> 02:10:40.721]  And I just want to thank you all, and I appreciate you all for your support.
[02:10:41.521 --> 02:10:43.142]  Now, we've got a bunch of these clips.
[02:10:43.182 --> 02:10:43.522]  My God.
[02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:45.183]  I'm looking at these clips.
[02:10:45.243 --> 02:10:57.749]  We've got hours of clips from the Congressional hearing today, with Strzok and Orr being grilled, and GOP lawmakers threaten FBI agent Peter Strzok with contempt for refusing to answer questions.
[02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:58.390]  U.S.
[02:10:58.430 --> 02:11:00.711]  Marshals serve subpoena on FBI lawyer Lisa Page.
[02:11:01.531 --> 02:11:04.532]  Uh, says that, uh, threatened to hold her in contempt.
[02:11:04.592 --> 02:11:12.334]  I mean, it's all crazy, but I've got like 20 minutes of Gowdy, but here's the last few minutes of him grilling these guys.
[02:11:13.654 --> 02:11:15.535]  And then we've got Mike Cernovich coming up.
[02:11:15.575 --> 02:11:16.495]  Let's go to some of this now.
[02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:16.855]  Here it is.
[02:11:17.615 --> 02:11:19.336]  A hundred million to zero?
[02:11:19.476 --> 02:11:21.536]  Agent Strzok, that's how bad she should win?
[02:11:21.556 --> 02:11:27.918]  Mr. Gowdy, those personal expressions of my observing the political process of the presidential primaries... I'm sorry, pause again.
[02:11:27.938 --> 02:11:28.518]  Start at the beginning.
[02:11:29.018 --> 02:11:30.499]  See, I gotta walk out of the room or I'm gonna interrupt.
[02:11:31.533 --> 02:11:46.346]  We have a five minute, nine second clip of Strzok saying he's never used his bias in a case when he's saying, I hate Trump, we will stop him, insurance policy, he'll never get in, Hillary's the president.
[02:11:46.846 --> 02:11:51.710]  I mean, we have him, this is perjury again, but he's such a little arrogant piece of crap!
[02:11:55.713 --> 02:11:57.855]  Who just lies with contempt and pleasure!
[02:11:58.776 --> 02:11:59.437]  Start over, sorry.
[02:12:00.821 --> 02:12:02.062]  100 million to zero?
[02:12:02.202 --> 02:12:04.284]  Agent Strzok, that's how bad she should win?
[02:12:04.764 --> 02:12:18.493]  Mr. Gowdy, those personal expressions of my observing the political process of the presidential primaries had no bearing on my actions of any investigation to include the investigation of Secretary Clinton or anybody else.
[02:12:19.073 --> 02:12:23.117]  Sir, if I may... You couldn't think of a single person that would not vote for Hillary Clinton for president?
[02:12:23.197 --> 02:12:24.598]  A hundred million to zero?
[02:12:24.838 --> 02:12:29.462]  That was clearly hyperbole, which I... Well, let's say it was hyperbole.
[02:12:29.502 --> 02:12:30.743]  Let's divide it by ten.
[02:12:30.923 --> 02:12:31.484]  Pause the game.
[02:12:31.864 --> 02:12:37.249]  This guy is a sycophant who called her the president, who covered up Russiagate, who covered up Servergate.
[02:12:37.529 --> 02:12:39.390]  He was the little handled butt boy.
[02:12:40.291 --> 02:12:43.514]  Her groom of the stool, and now he says he wasn't politically motivated.
[02:12:43.674 --> 02:12:43.915]  What?
[02:12:44.495 --> 02:12:46.037]  Look at the face of the traitor.
[02:12:46.557 --> 02:12:50.601]  Look at the face of the scum they have to get to betray this nation.
[02:12:50.681 --> 02:12:51.542]  Thank God.
[02:12:52.383 --> 02:12:53.024]  We're on to you.
[02:12:53.064 --> 02:12:53.484]  Continue.
[02:12:54.145 --> 02:12:55.006]  Plus hyperbole.
[02:12:55.046 --> 02:12:56.287]  Let's divide it by ten.
[02:12:56.307 --> 02:12:59.250]  How about we say it was hyperbolic and divide it by ten?
[02:12:59.490 --> 02:13:02.273]  A hundred million divided by ten, I'm pretty sure it's ten million.
[02:13:02.693 --> 02:13:04.034]  Zero divided by ten...
[02:13:05.464 --> 02:13:06.285]  Is still zero.
[02:13:06.625 --> 02:13:14.711]  You couldn't think of a single solitary person that was going to vote for her for president before you interviewed her and while you were supposed to be investigating her.
[02:13:15.052 --> 02:13:17.294]  Congressman, clearly that's not the truth.
[02:13:17.554 --> 02:13:20.436]  Clearly, I could envision millions of Americans... Look at that demon!
[02:13:20.456 --> 02:13:22.618]  ...who were likely and did vote for then-candidate.
[02:13:22.638 --> 02:13:23.478]  Well, you wrote it!
[02:13:23.619 --> 02:13:24.539]  My point, sir.
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:25.380]  Did you write it?
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:26.641]  Sir, I run America.
[02:13:26.661 --> 02:13:27.922]  I did write that, sir.
[02:13:28.062 --> 02:13:28.883]  Okay, were you under duress?
[02:13:28.963 --> 02:13:31.365]  A political expression engaging in hyperbole.
[02:13:31.385 --> 02:13:32.386]  Were you under duress?
[02:13:32.566 --> 02:13:33.487]  Asked and answered.
[02:13:34.327 --> 02:13:35.227]  Over and over again.
[02:13:35.247 --> 02:13:37.048]  While he was running at political operation.
[02:13:37.068 --> 02:13:38.988]  The gentleman from South Carolina controls the time.
[02:13:39.008 --> 02:13:42.069]  Alright, we're gonna go into one other time period.
[02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:43.869]  May 17th, 2017.
[02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:45.690]  Bob Mueller is appointed.
[02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:48.191]  Your friend Jim Comey's been fired.
[02:13:48.351 --> 02:13:50.991]  He's already leaked the memos to his law professor friend.
[02:13:51.111 --> 02:13:52.432]  And Mueller, a special counsel.
[02:13:52.572 --> 02:13:53.212]  And then lied about it.
[02:13:53.652 --> 02:13:59.733]  Do you remember how long it took for you to start talking about impeachment after Bob Mueller was appointed?
[02:14:00.434 --> 02:14:00.934]  I don't, sir.
[02:14:01.274 --> 02:14:01.654]  One day.
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:04.260]  One day.
[02:14:05.301 --> 02:14:07.161]  And you are talking about impeachment.
[02:14:07.221 --> 02:14:15.844]  And for anyone who may have missed it the day after his appointment, Agent Strzok, you did it again five days later.
[02:14:17.585 --> 02:14:23.187]  Now, how many interviews had you done as part of the special counsel team within the first five days of his appointment?
[02:14:24.201 --> 02:14:25.642]  Sir, again, same answer as before.
[02:14:25.722 --> 02:14:26.922]  I can't get into details.
[02:14:26.962 --> 02:14:28.663]  Right, and the answer is also the same.
[02:14:28.703 --> 02:14:29.363]  It's zero.
[02:14:29.583 --> 02:14:31.124]  No interviews have been done.
[02:14:31.144 --> 02:14:32.844]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[02:14:32.985 --> 02:14:43.149]  No interviews have been done by August the 8th when you're talking about stopping him and how terrifying it would be for him to win and how you can protect the country.
[02:14:43.209 --> 02:14:44.109]  He's not going to get elected.
[02:14:44.129 --> 02:14:49.031]  No interviews have been done before you're talking about impeachment of the president.
[02:14:50.186 --> 02:14:55.451]  No wonder Bob Mueller kicked you off of the investigation, Agent Strzok.
[02:14:56.972 --> 02:15:04.960]  My question is, if you were kicked off when you read the text, shouldn't you have been kicked off when you wrote them?
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:05.941]  Not at all.
[02:15:06.994 --> 02:15:10.137]  Well, it wasn't the discovery of your text, Mr. Strzok.
[02:15:10.277 --> 02:15:14.040]  It was the existence of your bias that got you kicked off.
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:15.621]  No, Mr. Gowdy, it wasn't.
[02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:17.222]  I do not have bias.
[02:15:17.683 --> 02:15:21.306]  My personal opinion is in no way... Well, then why did you get kicked off?
[02:15:21.346 --> 02:15:22.307]  Why'd you get kicked off?
[02:15:23.007 --> 02:15:25.629]  Mr. Gowdy, my understanding of why... Because he got caught.
[02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:31.895]  ...was that based on an understanding of those texts and the perception that they might create... Well, hang on a second.
[02:15:31.915 --> 02:15:33.576]  We will stop the president.
[02:15:33.616 --> 02:15:34.577]  He'll never get elected.
[02:15:35.077 --> 02:15:35.738]  We're gonna get him.
[02:15:36.584 --> 02:15:39.125]  We've got a breakout here.
[02:15:39.165 --> 02:15:39.926]  We've got more coming up.
[02:15:40.086 --> 02:15:41.246]  Mike Cernovus joins us.
[02:15:42.147 --> 02:15:44.668]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, the forbidden sites.
[02:15:44.748 --> 02:15:46.049]  I hope you don't visit the new free app.
[02:15:46.489 --> 02:15:47.850]  Infowars.com, Ford's last app.
[02:15:48.970 --> 02:15:58.655]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:16:07.654 --> 02:16:10.555]  What do you wanna do with your life?
[02:16:11.295 --> 02:16:12.095]  I wanna rock!
[02:16:15.156 --> 02:16:20.017]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[02:16:20.197 --> 02:16:26.619]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:16:32.179 --> 02:16:36.522]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[02:16:37.783 --> 02:16:44.387]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[02:16:44.667 --> 02:16:53.032]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[02:16:53.052 --> 02:16:56.154]  All right, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[02:16:57.264 --> 02:17:00.627]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockwell.
[02:17:00.807 --> 02:17:08.674]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[02:17:08.994 --> 02:17:19.823]  To work to erase national boundaries, create an international community, and in time, bring about a one-world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[02:17:21.142 --> 02:17:37.919]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[02:17:38.179 --> 02:17:44.766]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[02:17:45.106 --> 02:17:46.229]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[02:17:46.489 --> 02:17:51.119]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[02:17:51.259 --> 02:17:55.889]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:01.443]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[02:18:01.743 --> 02:18:05.906]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[02:18:05.966 --> 02:18:08.768]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[02:18:08.808 --> 02:18:16.353]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[02:18:16.633 --> 02:18:20.956]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[02:18:21.256 --> 02:18:26.580]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[02:18:27.660 --> 02:18:28.801]  I'm scared of these people.
[02:18:29.521 --> 02:18:30.581]  I'm very scared of them.
[02:18:31.562 --> 02:18:38.945]  How do you think the crack drop gets into the country?
[02:18:38.965 --> 02:18:40.365]  We don't own any planes.
[02:18:40.825 --> 02:18:41.926]  We don't own no ships.
[02:18:42.166 --> 02:18:45.547]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[02:18:45.747 --> 02:18:52.430]  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:18:54.785 --> 02:19:02.190]  The men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[02:19:02.210 --> 02:19:06.994]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[02:19:07.034 --> 02:19:14.099]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small airbase at Mena, Arkansas.
[02:19:14.559 --> 02:19:21.364]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran Contras
[02:19:21.924 --> 02:19:27.126]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[02:19:27.907 --> 02:19:33.829]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Contras, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowler Act.
[02:19:34.409 --> 02:19:39.431]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[02:19:39.631 --> 02:19:42.813]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[02:19:43.333 --> 02:19:45.994]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[02:19:46.694 --> 02:19:50.957]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[02:19:50.997 --> 02:19:51.277]  Lewinsky.
[02:19:51.817 --> 02:19:53.759]  These allegations are false.
[02:19:56.100 --> 02:20:00.623]  If you are pursuing this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[02:20:05.146 --> 02:20:07.768]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.326 --> 02:20:20.648]  There's something happening here.
[02:20:21.570 --> 02:20:22.171]  Something important.
[02:20:22.191 --> 02:20:24.355]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:20:24.836 --> 02:20:27.301]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:20:27.802 --> 02:20:30.186]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:30.467 --> 02:20:32.070]  The Summer of Rage!
[02:20:46.497 --> 02:20:47.998]  It's gaining pound for pound.
[02:20:48.879 --> 02:20:50.080]  Shooter Jennings bringing us in.
[02:20:50.581 --> 02:20:58.848]  So we're gonna play for you Peter Schrock who is the most arrogant creature you could imagine.
[02:20:58.888 --> 02:21:04.333]  This is the type of trash that Rosenstein that looks like a demon and acts like a demon and Mueller that looks like
[02:21:05.819 --> 02:21:06.359]  A mummy.
[02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:11.984]  And all the crimes they've committed, and all the dozens of texts, we'll stop him.
[02:21:12.024 --> 02:21:13.005]  He'll never get in.
[02:21:13.385 --> 02:21:14.226]  He's a danger.
[02:21:14.266 --> 02:21:15.287]  Hillary's the president.
[02:21:15.607 --> 02:21:17.128]  We'll keep him from getting in office.
[02:21:17.608 --> 02:21:18.990]  Once he's in office, we'll stop him.
[02:21:20.531 --> 02:21:22.272]  And then he gets up in a five-minute statement.
[02:21:22.332 --> 02:21:26.536]  For TV viewers, I'll be putting his quotes up from the text messages while he talks.
[02:21:28.037 --> 02:21:30.619]  This is like somebody saying that they
[02:21:33.976 --> 02:21:36.417]  Like to play football and then say they've never seen a football game.
[02:21:36.957 --> 02:21:39.737]  I mean, he's in this a thousand percent.
[02:21:40.177 --> 02:21:41.278]  He's a Democratic operative.
[02:21:41.298 --> 02:21:42.278]  He covers up for Hillary.
[02:21:42.318 --> 02:21:46.459]  He's the little special minion that does all this and all these investigations.
[02:21:46.539 --> 02:21:49.259]  And now he's telling you it's preposterous.
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:51.280]  I did none of this political.
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:54.861]  My Mueller and Rosenstein and all of this is completely normal.
[02:21:54.981 --> 02:21:55.861]  Let's go to it right now.
[02:21:57.801 --> 02:21:59.982]  I testify today with significant regret.
[02:22:00.002 --> 02:22:00.562]  Sorry, pause again.
[02:22:02.096 --> 02:22:07.618]  I've got it on my phone here, a photo of Howdy Doody, I mean Rosenstein, where he looks so satanic.
[02:22:07.958 --> 02:22:09.598]  Not just his actions, but the way he looks.
[02:22:09.618 --> 02:22:16.160]  I'm going to pull that up, but for TV viewers, we're going to be blowing up the faces of the FBI people behind him that walked in with him.
[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:17.820]  Look at these people.
[02:22:18.621 --> 02:22:21.381]  They just hired the most weak, stupid followers.
[02:22:22.162 --> 02:22:23.102]  All of them look like
[02:22:24.537 --> 02:22:26.218]  You wouldn't let him babysit your children.
[02:22:26.778 --> 02:22:29.380]  All of them look like deranged loons from a Hollywood movie.
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:31.481]  This guy, all of them.
[02:22:31.521 --> 02:22:36.724]  I mean, I would cast them in a movie as really bad guys.
[02:22:37.865 --> 02:22:39.425]  It's not just how they look, it's how they act.
[02:22:39.445 --> 02:22:40.786]  But, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:22:41.146 --> 02:22:42.687]  They're not square-jawed FBI agents.
[02:22:42.968 --> 02:22:44.008]  Hey, will somebody plug my phone in?
[02:22:44.028 --> 02:22:44.668]  I forgot to do it.
[02:22:44.688 --> 02:22:46.690]  I guess my plug's over here somewhere.
[02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:47.010]  Here it is.
[02:22:48.251 --> 02:22:51.012]  I'm gonna plug this baby in because I want to pull up the Rosenstein photo.
[02:22:51.592 --> 02:22:54.194]  It's like a really cheesy one where he's going like this from the side going,
[02:22:56.832 --> 02:22:59.513]  Again, in their little delusional world, they're part of the power structure.
[02:22:59.893 --> 02:23:00.953]  They feel invincible.
[02:23:00.993 --> 02:23:02.413]  They love ruling over America.
[02:23:02.433 --> 02:23:05.534]  It gives them this, and selling us out to foreign interests is a bigger thrill.
[02:23:06.054 --> 02:23:11.695]  So let's hear him lie to Congress, lie to you, when on its face, you found it.
[02:23:11.975 --> 02:23:12.935]  Good Lord, look at that.
[02:23:13.976 --> 02:23:14.616]  Look at that.
[02:23:14.696 --> 02:23:25.398]  That Clinton operative taking over the Justice Department from Trump, all of it, and then look at that, look at that crazy, mad dog, Robert Mueller,
[02:23:26.357 --> 02:23:26.798]  That's a creature.
[02:23:27.118 --> 02:23:29.281]  That's a creature of the Clintons, a mueller of all of them.
[02:23:29.682 --> 02:23:32.566]  And just he, and everyone grovels to him in D.C.
[02:23:33.106 --> 02:23:34.248]  Oh, you're law enforcement!
[02:23:34.689 --> 02:23:35.790]  Oh, you could arrest me!
[02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:36.872]  Oh, you could indict me!
[02:23:36.892 --> 02:23:41.538]  And then they're in the news saying, we're spying on Manafort, and we know about his defense plans.
[02:23:42.139 --> 02:23:44.761]  I'm like, wow, you're spying on Manafort in jail in his defense plans.
[02:23:45.161 --> 02:23:46.823]  That would be a scandal five years ago.
[02:23:46.863 --> 02:23:52.607]  But it's all, it's just the mad dog craziness of this guy that doesn't get he's already been defeated.
[02:23:53.348 --> 02:23:56.310]  So let's hear from his minion, Peter Strzok, right now.
[02:23:56.350 --> 02:23:56.650]  Here it is.
[02:23:58.251 --> 02:24:06.298]  I testify today with significant regret, recognizing that my texts have created confusion and caused pain for people I love.
[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:10.462]  I'm glad these guys are all there to give him comfort.
[02:24:10.482 --> 02:24:13.043]  I'm sure they do a lot of the time.
[02:24:38.095 --> 02:24:41.058]  Opinions that were not always expressed in terms I'm proud of.
[02:24:42.459 --> 02:24:46.922]  But having worked in national security for two decades and proudly served in the U.S.
[02:24:47.022 --> 02:24:57.191]  Army, those opinions were expressed out of deep patriotism and an unyielding belief in our great American democracy.
[02:24:58.092 --> 02:25:02.896]  But despite how it's been characterized, it was not limited to one person or to one party.
[02:25:03.911 --> 02:25:12.513]  I criticize various countries and politicians, including Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, then-candidate Trump, and others.
[02:25:13.933 --> 02:25:14.953]  But let me be clear.
[02:25:15.933 --> 02:25:20.414]  Unequivocally... That's not an earring.
[02:25:20.434 --> 02:25:23.475]  I guess that's like a... Vampire ears?
[02:25:23.495 --> 02:25:24.575]  That's vampire ears.
[02:25:24.655 --> 02:25:26.555]  I wonder what he does at the office.
[02:25:26.875 --> 02:25:29.836]  There's Sweeney K. And then who's this one?
[02:25:32.165 --> 02:25:33.126]  Is that Dennis Hastert's son?
[02:25:33.206 --> 02:25:35.788]  It is not who I am, and it is not something I would ever do.
[02:26:02.059 --> 02:26:02.900]  There is, however.
[02:26:03.581 --> 02:26:05.202]  There's no evidence of bias!
[02:26:05.623 --> 02:26:07.204]  We will stop him from being elected!
[02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:08.886]  We will have an insurance policy!
[02:26:09.106 --> 02:26:09.827]  He's a threat!
[02:26:09.847 --> 02:26:10.588]  She's the president!
[02:26:10.628 --> 02:26:11.449]  We will stop him!
[02:26:11.709 --> 02:26:12.630]  There's no bias!
[02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:15.953]  You're trying to sabotage the election, you goddamn traitor!
[02:26:16.614 --> 02:26:17.675]  Delay that for the stations.
[02:26:18.115 --> 02:26:18.716]  Go back to him.
[02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:23.490]  My integrity?
[02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:25.091]  I've got the entire Fruit Basket Brigade behind me.
[02:26:25.111 --> 02:26:26.432]  He states that like it's a fact.
[02:26:26.452 --> 02:26:27.072]  Look at his beard.
[02:26:27.092 --> 02:26:28.433]  Oh my god, we had a good time last night.
[02:26:28.453 --> 02:26:28.613]  Oh yeah.
[02:26:28.633 --> 02:26:29.234]  Killin' this baby.
[02:26:50.868 --> 02:26:54.009]  That's what FBI agents do every single day.
[02:26:54.409 --> 02:26:55.889]  And that's why I'm so proud of you.
[02:26:56.949 --> 02:27:01.890]  And I'm particularly proud of the work that I... Particularly proud that you're the Praetorian Guard.
[02:27:01.930 --> 02:27:04.650]  Our Praetorian Guard was that they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[02:27:04.770 --> 02:27:09.471]  ...competently, honestly, and independently, and that's exactly what happened.
[02:27:09.491 --> 02:27:10.992]  Look how proud his little buddy is behind him.
[02:27:11.012 --> 02:27:13.852]  I'm also proud of our work on the Russian... He's proud of his friend.
[02:27:14.832 --> 02:27:16.672]  Zoom in on that guy's mouth, the other one.
[02:27:16.732 --> 02:27:18.593]  The little goblin one, yeah.
[02:27:18.693 --> 02:27:19.393]  Zoom in on his mouth.
[02:27:20.376 --> 02:27:22.217]  He's so proud of his daddy.
[02:27:22.277 --> 02:27:25.819]  My daddy will beat him.
[02:27:26.059 --> 02:27:27.360]  My daddy always wins.
[02:27:27.940 --> 02:27:33.563]  Mueller told me that time in the hotel room when we were meeting about politics.
[02:27:33.583 --> 02:27:35.284]  We can't beat this!
[02:27:47.748 --> 02:27:48.328]  This is the FBI.
[02:27:48.368 --> 02:27:50.930]  This investigation is not politically motivated.
[02:27:51.850 --> 02:27:53.091]  It is not a witch hunt.
[02:27:53.871 --> 02:27:54.952]  It is not a hoax.
[02:27:55.812 --> 02:27:56.793]  Yes, it's all real.
[02:27:57.253 --> 02:27:58.634]  Trump's trying to make America great again.
[02:27:58.674 --> 02:27:59.715]  We sold out the Chinese.
[02:27:59.755 --> 02:28:00.315]  He's the enemy.
[02:28:00.415 --> 02:28:01.456]  ...ongoing investigation.
[02:28:02.356 --> 02:28:06.638]  Where the FBI has directed me not to answer, I will abide by the FBI's instructions.
[02:28:06.959 --> 02:28:07.879]  But let me be clear.
[02:28:08.559 --> 02:28:11.561]  This is not because I don't want to answer your questions.
[02:28:11.721 --> 02:28:12.322]  Oh, of course.
[02:28:12.342 --> 02:28:14.443]  If I were permitted to answer, I would.
[02:28:15.362 --> 02:28:20.364]  And the answers would doubtless be disappointing to the questioners and undermine the conspiracy narrative.
[02:28:20.384 --> 02:28:21.004]  Turn him off.
[02:28:21.264 --> 02:28:22.425]  Oh, the conspiracy theories.
[02:28:22.725 --> 02:28:24.385]  Questioning known liars like you.
[02:28:25.706 --> 02:28:27.086]  I was just making jokes about these guys.
[02:28:27.106 --> 02:28:27.927]  They just look ridiculous.
[02:28:28.207 --> 02:28:30.228]  I saw a couple of those guys walking in with him, though.
[02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:33.869]  I mean, that's who struck to get to walk in with him.
[02:28:34.129 --> 02:28:36.150]  So, I gotta give him some courage right there.
[02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:39.111]  All I can say is ramming speed.
[02:28:39.571 --> 02:28:40.591]  All power to the engines.
[02:28:40.851 --> 02:28:41.732]  Attack course.
[02:28:42.912 --> 02:28:46.717]  We'll be right back on the other side with Mike Cernovich, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:28:47.117 --> 02:28:49.741]  InfoWars is the dreaded, vaunted enemy of tyranny.
[02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:03.471]  This 4th of July is special.
[02:29:03.491 --> 02:29:04.972]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[02:29:05.492 --> 02:29:09.614]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[02:29:09.914 --> 02:29:13.575]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance to the globalists.
[02:29:14.296 --> 02:29:19.358]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[02:29:19.398 --> 02:29:23.140]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:25.863]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[02:29:26.283 --> 02:29:28.146]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[02:29:28.226 --> 02:29:31.331]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[02:29:31.371 --> 02:29:38.060]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[02:29:38.521 --> 02:29:40.403]  We have record sales going on right now.

[02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:59.503]  This Fourth of July is special, and our sales are special to match it.
[02:29:59.723 --> 02:30:00.804]  Infowarrestore.com.
[02:30:06.328 --> 02:30:08.229]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:08.689 --> 02:30:11.851]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.

[02:30:18.474 --> 02:30:23.736]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all-new version of the powerhouse preglanone product.

[02:30:49.194 --> 02:30:53.297]  It's got all the great stuff that Real Red Pill has, but it's also got the boost in it.
[02:30:53.678 --> 02:30:57.501]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:31:01.207 --> 02:31:13.191]  As one who has been targeted by the deep state, I cannot tell you how important it is to continue to have InfoWars as an outlet to expose the truth.
[02:31:13.851 --> 02:31:18.852]  When Alex Jones and I appeal for your help, we're not exaggerating.
[02:31:19.292 --> 02:31:20.873]  We are not giving you hype.
[02:31:21.946 --> 02:31:25.850]  Infowars is under attack as never before.
[02:31:26.391 --> 02:31:36.041]  Alex Jones and Infowars are facing multi-million dollar lawsuits, fueled by the radical left, and in some cases, George Soros.
[02:31:36.561 --> 02:31:38.824]  And they have a two-pronged approach.
[02:31:39.504 --> 02:31:54.199]  Use the negative headlines generated by their lawsuits as a rationale to take us off of YouTube, take us off of Facebook, take us off of Twitter, take us off social media entirely, and shut us down.
[02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:56.502]  There's no exaggeration here.
[02:31:56.982 --> 02:32:01.207]  Every one of these lawsuits against Alex Jones and InfoWars are frivolous.
[02:32:01.907 --> 02:32:02.728]  They're bogus.
[02:32:03.209 --> 02:32:04.170]  They're harassment.
[02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:07.453]  But that doesn't mean that they are inexpensive.
[02:32:07.954 --> 02:32:12.759]  They could, in the end, cost millions to keep InfoWars alive.
[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:18.225]  And therefore, we ask you to go to the InfoWars site and find the donate button.
[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:35.887]  You can give a generous contribution today if you're not in the market for one of our great nutraceutical products, or a book, or a t-shirt, but you want to help the fight for freedom, then go to the donate button and send us $25, or $50, or $100.
[02:32:36.427 --> 02:32:41.169]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have actually sent $1,000 or more.
[02:32:41.629 --> 02:32:44.530]  It will be the best investment you have ever made.
[02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:49.492]  Because we will continue to broadcast the truth here at InfoWars.
[02:32:49.992 --> 02:32:51.713]  We are not weak sisters.
[02:32:52.053 --> 02:32:54.374]  We are not sunshine patriots.
[02:32:54.735 --> 02:32:59.477]  We will fight for America to the bitter end and we will prevail.
[02:33:04.639 --> 02:33:07.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.498 --> 02:33:20.421]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:21.622 --> 02:33:25.045]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:25.826 --> 02:33:26.967]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:02.123 --> 02:34:05.046]  Mike Cernovich joins us for the balance of this hour.
[02:34:06.007 --> 02:34:07.488]  It's gotten almost no attention.
[02:34:07.588 --> 02:34:15.255]  I didn't even know a bill had been introduced a month ago that if Antifa commits civil rights violations, crimes, with a mask on, they get 15 years in prison.
[02:34:15.275 --> 02:34:18.338]  That's pretty normal under aggravated assault type laws.
[02:34:18.538 --> 02:34:21.100]  Like if you rob a bank with his mask, it's even more time.
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:22.721]  Instead of 15 years, it's like 30 years.
[02:34:23.462 --> 02:34:33.967]  And so I saw the story in the Epoch Times, we'll put it up on screen, and they mentioned that Mike Cernovich had been promoting it, and so many times, you know, Mike's kind of that catalyst there that helped take something to the next level.
[02:34:34.548 --> 02:34:39.070]  Mike pointed out to us that, you know, we had Bill Clinton come into town a few weeks ago.
[02:34:39.450 --> 02:34:50.976]  So I wanted to get Mike on about this because Antifa's getting more aggressive, more vicious, they're attacking more, the left's trying to cause a civil war, and what does he think the next shoe to drop is?
[02:34:50.996 --> 02:34:52.197]  So Mike, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:34:53.407 --> 02:34:54.427]  Yeah, my pleasure.
[02:34:54.527 --> 02:35:02.230]  This is an important law that treats Antifa what they are, which is they are the modern KKK.
[02:35:02.730 --> 02:35:06.011]  They are a modern terrorist hate organization.
[02:35:06.491 --> 02:35:09.052]  They've said that they are pro pedophile.
[02:35:09.372 --> 02:35:12.893]  They've said that they hate and want to kill all people who voted for Trump.
[02:35:13.513 --> 02:35:18.415]  They've announced their intention to destroy America internally.
[02:35:18.495 --> 02:35:22.556]  So they are being treated as they should be treated, which is as terrorists.
[02:35:24.531 --> 02:35:26.072]  Well, let's talk about this bill.
[02:35:26.452 --> 02:35:28.013]  Again, it's from Epoch Times.
[02:35:28.233 --> 02:35:29.714]  It's on your website as well.
[02:35:29.734 --> 02:35:31.275]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:35:31.296 --> 02:35:33.597]  But let's talk about the Pacific Bill.
[02:35:56.352 --> 02:35:56.652]  Right.
[02:35:57.013 --> 02:35:59.614]  The law is, again, flew under the radar.
[02:36:00.095 --> 02:36:05.018]  Ironically, I only learned about it because unlike liberals, I follow everybody.
[02:36:05.338 --> 02:36:12.163]  And I saw that a far left wing activist, journalist, and so I can't believe Congress is considering that.
[02:36:12.283 --> 02:36:13.904]  And I go, oh, well, thank you.
[02:36:14.524 --> 02:36:15.465]  Thank you for the tip off.
[02:36:15.485 --> 02:36:16.666]  I actually had no idea.
[02:36:16.706 --> 02:36:18.867]  So we've had thousands of people.
[02:36:18.887 --> 02:36:19.888]  Yeah.
[02:36:19.948 --> 02:36:22.209]  Jack Smith actually had tipped everybody off.
[02:36:22.249 --> 02:36:23.270]  He has a very obscure
[02:36:24.246 --> 02:36:29.029]  But I like to follow those obscure accounts to really, to really know what the far left is thinking.
[02:36:29.770 --> 02:36:34.332]  And I was like, oh, okay, let's talk about this a little bit.
[02:36:34.352 --> 02:36:39.095]  And thousands of people have called Congress and have said this is way past due.
[02:36:39.536 --> 02:36:42.377]  Because the reason they wear masks is so you can't find them.
[02:36:42.417 --> 02:36:51.543]  So a lot of hubble it was being made about the fact that all of the charges and the disrupt J 20 riots during inauguration were dismissed and people go, Oh,
[02:36:52.366 --> 02:36:53.226]  Poor Antifa.
[02:36:53.527 --> 02:36:54.887]  They were impressed by the government.
[02:36:55.267 --> 02:36:55.728]  No, no, no.
[02:36:55.948 --> 02:36:57.368]  They had masks on.
[02:36:57.428 --> 02:36:58.929]  So you couldn't tell who.
[02:36:59.049 --> 02:37:01.030]  Remember, they burned down a Muslim.
[02:37:01.050 --> 02:37:04.172]  They burned down a Muslim limo driver's car.
[02:37:04.692 --> 02:37:10.435]  They destroyed a property of people without any regard for the safety of others.
[02:37:10.655 --> 02:37:14.016]  And you couldn't figure out who they were because they were all wearing masks.
[02:37:14.056 --> 02:37:16.497]  Well, at the inauguration, it took us hours to get in.
[02:37:16.517 --> 02:37:19.499]  They were mainly beating up women and blocking the entrances.
[02:37:19.559 --> 02:37:21.640]  So Shannon could say no one was inside the inauguration.
[02:37:23.123 --> 02:37:23.944]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:23.964 --> 02:37:24.804]  The Deplora Ball.
[02:37:24.824 --> 02:37:26.365]  I mean, there's a number of things, actually.
[02:37:26.385 --> 02:37:34.249]  Just recently, for example, a Fox News reporter, she had to quit reporting outside of the Supreme Court.
[02:37:34.269 --> 02:37:35.250]  She got run out of there.
[02:37:35.490 --> 02:37:36.151]  And that's another thing.
[02:37:36.171 --> 02:37:37.771]  I've tried to videotape outside the Supreme Court.
[02:37:38.052 --> 02:37:39.072]  Police say you have to get a permit.
[02:37:39.352 --> 02:37:41.554]  But all the left could show up, the police just let them do it.
[02:37:42.954 --> 02:37:43.155]  Right.
[02:37:43.215 --> 02:37:46.496]  And then they ran off, of course, to a woman.
[02:37:46.516 --> 02:37:48.758]  That's what they do.
[02:37:49.821 --> 02:37:51.202]  All right, let's let your Skype come back.
[02:37:51.342 --> 02:37:52.683]  Let's let your Skype come back for a moment.
[02:37:53.143 --> 02:37:54.184]  Mike Cernovich is our guest.
[02:37:55.325 --> 02:37:57.346]  Mike, clearly they're trying to cause a civil war.
[02:37:57.406 --> 02:37:58.927]  They're saying surround the White House.
[02:37:58.967 --> 02:38:02.489]  They want to try to block the new Supreme Court nominee.
[02:38:03.010 --> 02:38:08.653]  When I say that they want a civil war and they're calling it one, and even USA Today calls it a civil war, then they make a joke about it.
[02:38:08.673 --> 02:38:10.454]  But where would you say we are right now?
[02:38:10.855 --> 02:38:11.595]  You're a smart guy.
[02:38:11.695 --> 02:38:15.638]  What do you think they're planning ahead of the midterms to try to derail things?
[02:38:17.185 --> 02:38:22.568]  Well, what they're doing is they're energizing the terrorist element of the far left wing.
[02:38:22.588 --> 02:38:25.069]  They're now overtly saying that they are communists.
[02:38:25.810 --> 02:38:34.495]  And I predict a major terrorist attack by a far left wing element, perhaps a Democrat socialist, perhaps an Antifa element.
[02:38:35.035 --> 02:38:37.897]  It just really is going to happen.
[02:38:37.917 --> 02:38:40.038]  And what they don't understand, and
[02:38:40.888 --> 02:38:49.533]  Broadly speaking, of course, I talked to a lot of liberals and one of the most genuine, he's a very far left guy, but he's still like a very good human being, good Christian.
[02:38:49.553 --> 02:38:53.236]  And he goes, you know, I just want the civil war to get off.
[02:38:54.416 --> 02:38:56.658]  I was like, what are you thinking?
[02:38:57.438 --> 02:38:58.659]  How could you think that?
[02:38:58.999 --> 02:38:59.840]  But that's where they are.
[02:39:02.041 --> 02:39:07.104]  Why do you think while they call for civil war everywhere, when I cover it, then they say I'm crazy, that's not happening?
[02:39:09.778 --> 02:39:11.620]  Yeah, yeah, then they go, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:14.042]  But you can just go read Twitter.
[02:39:14.062 --> 02:39:20.229]  I love when they go, oh, Alex's July 4 tweet about a second civil war is a conspiracy theory.
[02:39:20.549 --> 02:39:27.977]  But if you go on Twitter and just type in civil war, you can find tens of thousands of results from people on the left saying they wanted civil war.
[02:39:27.997 --> 02:39:30.559]  And clearly they said this July 4th we're going to intensify attacks.
[02:39:30.579 --> 02:39:30.980]  They did.
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:32.862]  I'm just saying it's a demarcation line.
[02:39:33.911 --> 02:39:38.555]  If they're successful, you can mark this July 4th as when it's going to escalate up.
[02:39:38.795 --> 02:39:43.258]  But I'm asking, what's the tactic then to call for it, but when we cover it, say it's not happening?
[02:39:44.579 --> 02:39:49.423]  Well, what they're doing is they're actually gaslighting you to try to get you banned.
[02:39:49.463 --> 02:39:55.608]  You know, one of your competitors is like anti-trustee and is trying to get you banned for reporting on what the left is saying.
[02:39:55.948 --> 02:40:02.674]  So what they're doing is they're so duplicitous that people on the far left say, we're going to intensify our efforts after July 4th.
[02:40:03.254 --> 02:40:04.615]  We're really going to fight hard.
[02:40:04.675 --> 02:40:08.717]  And then they say, oh, yeah, we're communists and we want to abolish ICE.
[02:40:09.277 --> 02:40:20.523]  But then the New York Times will fact check it and say, actually, Democrats don't want to abolish ICE, even though a survey just came out from a liberal publication saying that 45 percent of Democrats want to abolish ICE.
[02:40:20.623 --> 02:40:20.803]  Right.
[02:40:20.843 --> 02:40:31.108]  So what they do, they're gaslighting us now and saying, well, I mean, even though you can show a screenshot of what they said, even though you can show a survey,
[02:40:31.516 --> 02:40:35.439]  We're just going to say that that isn't really true and that nobody wants to abolish ICE.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.121]  And then they're going to say, well, Facebook, you're fighting fake news.
[02:40:38.141 --> 02:40:42.545]  Why don't you ban our competitor, Alex Jones, from your platform?
[02:40:42.585 --> 02:40:42.925]  Right.
[02:40:42.985 --> 02:40:43.886]  That's where we are.
[02:40:44.306 --> 02:40:47.048]  What they're doing is they did this to me.
[02:40:47.068 --> 02:40:47.989]  They fact checked me.
[02:40:48.269 --> 02:40:57.977]  I did an article in a video where I said that the one of the school shooters, which, by the way, we all forgot about because he didn't use an AR-15 and therefore it didn't work in the agenda.
[02:40:58.798 --> 02:41:00.139]  The most recent school shooting
[02:41:00.492 --> 02:41:04.494]  The shooter had on an iron cross, and he had on a hammer and sickle.
[02:41:05.195 --> 02:41:10.097]  And I said, those are symbols of the alt-right and Antifa, right?
[02:41:10.597 --> 02:41:15.680]  And then they fact-checked it, and the fact-checker goes, well, the hammer and sickle isn't a symbol of Antifa?
[02:41:16.541 --> 02:41:20.143]  Well, just go to Google Image and type in Antifa.
[02:41:20.283 --> 02:41:24.105]  Every rally they have, there are people wearing that Soviet Union stuff.
[02:41:25.005 --> 02:41:29.808]  Exactly, they wear black, and then they wear hammer and sickle pins.
[02:41:31.638 --> 02:41:40.100]  Right, so then I got fact-checked, and then I got a strike against my Facebook page, because while you were fact-checked, sir, and then when I go, Facebook, what are you talking about?
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:41.461]  I can show you a thousand images.
[02:41:41.861 --> 02:41:45.342]  Well, we've outsourced, you know, this to FactChecker.org.
[02:41:45.642 --> 02:41:49.823]  So what FactChecker does now is, they just, so I might actually sue FactChecker.
[02:41:49.863 --> 02:41:51.684]  They outsourced the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:41:52.524 --> 02:41:54.684]  Right, and then they go, oh, our hands are tied.
[02:41:54.704 --> 02:41:56.905]  A Christian group, for example, was banned.
[02:41:57.403 --> 02:42:03.206]  from Amazon Smiles program because the Southern Poverty Law Center now has VO control.
[02:42:03.851 --> 02:42:05.192]  I mean, there's so much going on, Alex.
[02:42:05.252 --> 02:42:06.772]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:42:07.112 --> 02:42:16.776]  Think what authoritarians, they're all over CNN bragging how they're censoring conservatives, Christians, veterans, gun groups, sovereign groups, you know, Taiwanese groups.
[02:42:17.337 --> 02:42:22.158]  Taiwanese flag is banned on Apple to be able to text it.
[02:42:22.579 --> 02:42:27.141]  I mean, we're under total attack, and they announce it, but then go, oh, but you're crazy, it's not happening.
[02:42:28.321 --> 02:42:30.562]  Yeah, I mean, everywhere you look, the alliance, I mean, facts.
[02:42:31.055 --> 02:42:34.817]  The Alliance Defense Fund has been banned from Amazon Smile's program.
[02:42:35.017 --> 02:42:35.658]  That's a fact.
[02:42:36.118 --> 02:42:36.358]  Why?
[02:42:36.418 --> 02:42:42.761]  Because Amazon has delegated control over the Amazon Smile program to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:42:42.781 --> 02:42:46.704]  Let's come back from break and talk about how we change this because it's such a bold power grab.
[02:42:46.724 --> 02:42:48.465]  If we just expose it, it will fall.
[02:42:48.505 --> 02:42:48.925]  Stay with us.
[02:42:49.145 --> 02:42:49.965]  Mike Cernovich straight ahead.
[02:42:50.346 --> 02:42:59.291]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:43:03.496 --> 02:43:07.579]  What you're about to see are two presidents of the teachers union.
[02:43:07.719 --> 02:43:10.421]  One guy named Dave Perry near Trenton, New Jersey.
[02:43:10.461 --> 02:43:13.783]  Another named Kathleen Valencia in Union City, New Jersey.
[02:43:13.803 --> 02:43:17.946]  And they're talking about covering up child abusers in the public schools.
[02:43:18.626 --> 02:43:21.228]  Dave Perry, the statements he makes are so shocking.
[02:43:21.268 --> 02:43:24.890]  He actually says, we want to turn it back around onto the child.
[02:43:24.930 --> 02:43:25.931]  He says, it's my job.
[02:43:26.551 --> 02:43:28.093]  He says I'm gonna backdate it.
[02:43:28.153 --> 02:43:30.937]  That's commit fraud after the incident of abuse.
[02:43:31.398 --> 02:43:33.400]  He says that's his job at the teachers union.
[02:43:33.420 --> 02:43:35.463]  He's there to protect the worst people.
[02:43:35.964 --> 02:43:37.085]  He's there to bend the truth.
[02:43:37.626 --> 02:43:39.328]  And he's there to reverse it back onto the kid.
[02:43:39.348 --> 02:43:43.333]  There's me confronting Dave Perry, who denied the things he said.
[02:43:43.393 --> 02:43:44.455]  Now last night, Alex,
[02:43:45.315 --> 02:43:51.980]  The National Education Association and the NJEA, that's the New Jersey version of it, has suspended him.
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:44:00.606]  So they've suspended one union president and then just today, Alex, we released another woman in New Jersey saying that she was protecting child abuse.
[02:44:00.686 --> 02:44:02.227]  But I don't want him coming here with a bunch of lies.
[02:44:02.287 --> 02:44:04.629]  I need to know the truth so that we can bend the truth.
[02:44:05.369 --> 02:44:05.469]  Okay.
[02:44:05.489 --> 02:44:06.350]  Yeah, like a physical skirmish.
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:24.241]  I'm going to date it back to the day after the incident.
[02:44:24.842 --> 02:44:25.242]  Okay.
[02:44:25.302 --> 02:44:26.262]  He was upset.
[02:44:26.302 --> 02:44:26.982]  He was worried.
[02:44:27.323 --> 02:44:28.403]  He did shake the kid.
[02:44:28.643 --> 02:44:30.824]  So if they said there was bruises he had, there was bruises where?
[02:44:30.884 --> 02:44:32.645]  I got to ask him where he hit him.
[02:44:33.585 --> 02:44:36.347]  Yeah, because he was trying to put him back in his seat because he was getting physical.
[02:44:36.367 --> 02:44:37.187]  It was tough.
[02:44:37.487 --> 02:44:39.088]  We reverse it onto the kid.
[02:44:39.768 --> 02:44:40.949]  Okay, yeah.
[02:44:41.129 --> 02:44:41.729]  That's my job.
[02:44:41.909 --> 02:44:44.650]  It's not a good job, but it's my job and what I have to do.
[02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:48.591]  This file right here is from a teacher who had sex with a student.
[02:44:49.152 --> 02:44:50.112]  Okay?
[02:44:51.012 --> 02:44:52.673]  They're not going to jail.
[02:44:53.313 --> 02:44:56.094]  You know what this whole file is about?
[02:44:56.154 --> 02:44:59.756]  It's about whether or not they get to keep their pension.
[02:45:00.336 --> 02:45:00.776]  Okay.
[02:45:01.716 --> 02:45:03.977]  The sex with the teenage girl.
[02:45:05.718 --> 02:45:07.459]  Okay.
[02:45:07.759 --> 02:45:08.299]  Is it going to jail?
[02:45:11.121 --> 02:45:11.321]  No.
[02:45:11.442 --> 02:45:13.722]  I'm being as brutally honest with you as I can.
[02:45:14.542 --> 02:45:23.045]  If you are afraid of a middle school child who called you a d*** and spit on you and advanced towards you, you are in the wrong profession.
[02:45:23.065 --> 02:45:23.705]  Kid's fine.
[02:45:24.625 --> 02:45:25.165]  Kid's not hurt.
[02:45:25.286 --> 02:45:26.486]  Kid got a scratch.
[02:45:27.246 --> 02:45:28.486]  He's gonna give the kid a 65, right?
[02:45:30.919 --> 02:45:31.900]  He's not gonna fail the kid?
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:32.800]  No, no.
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:34.841]  No, he's not gonna fail the kid?
[02:45:35.461 --> 02:45:40.624]  He's gonna get that kid out of his f***ing classroom and move on fresh for September.
[02:45:41.204 --> 02:45:46.127]  We're facing a crisis in American education, and this week, the NJEA is under fire.
[02:45:46.607 --> 02:45:49.589]  Teachers unions would have you believe that they're fighting for our children.
[02:45:50.089 --> 02:45:55.852]  But the evidence in these tapes show they're fighting for themselves, their survival, and their own dominance.
[02:46:03.905 --> 02:46:05.326]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:46:05.366 --> 02:46:06.807]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:46:06.867 --> 02:46:07.227]  Go ahead.
[02:46:07.327 --> 02:46:07.627]  Yes.
[02:46:08.028 --> 02:46:08.768]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:08.868 --> 02:46:15.072]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:46:15.292 --> 02:46:19.075]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:46:19.475 --> 02:46:20.958]  In particular, silver bullet.
[02:46:21.318 --> 02:46:31.173]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet and it like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:46:31.253 --> 02:46:34.658]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[02:46:34.938 --> 02:46:36.519]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:46:36.559 --> 02:46:44.403]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:46:44.423 --> 02:46:50.226]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:46:50.366 --> 02:46:55.668]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:46:55.688 --> 02:46:58.770]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[02:47:04.611 --> 02:47:07.332]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:12.875 --> 02:47:14.316]  We shall go on to the end.
[02:47:15.396 --> 02:47:16.757]  We shall fight in France.
[02:47:17.778 --> 02:47:19.819]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[02:47:20.959 --> 02:47:25.381]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[02:47:26.882 --> 02:47:30.104]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[02:47:30.124 --> 02:47:32.285]  We shall fight on the beaches.
[02:47:33.129 --> 02:47:34.950]  We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[02:47:35.851 --> 02:47:38.913]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[02:47:39.513 --> 02:47:40.994]  We shall fight in the hills.
[02:47:41.955 --> 02:47:43.255]  We shall never surrender!
[02:47:43.275 --> 02:47:51.561]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:54.875 --> 02:47:58.698]  Yeah, they're trying to censor us on the web and doing a good job, but our listeners are getting around them.
[02:47:58.738 --> 02:48:03.662]  But we're on close to 300 radio affiliates, 400 TV stations, over 80 cable stations.
[02:48:04.543 --> 02:48:06.204]  And thank God to all of you, we appreciate you.
[02:48:06.244 --> 02:48:10.107]  Mike Cernovich is here, whether it's a media analyst, lawyer, you name it, good friend of mine.
[02:48:11.248 --> 02:48:12.830]  And we're going to go a little bit in the next hour.
[02:48:12.870 --> 02:48:16.293]  And we got Mike Adams coming in here with a compilation of the media attacking InfoWars.
[02:48:16.953 --> 02:48:19.275]  All the fake TV shows they've got, all the programs.
[02:48:19.375 --> 02:48:22.257]  Sacha Baron Cohen, we now know for six months has been trying to infiltrate us.
[02:48:23.439 --> 02:48:28.188]  Uh, and been trying to, like, get on... because he couldn't get in the office, he got on with, like, guests and tried to mess with them.
[02:48:28.208 --> 02:48:33.738]  I was told about this a month ago, but now I've been given the full details, so, uh, that's all coming up.
[02:48:35.370 --> 02:48:46.820]  But Mike Cernovich, striking back, how we win, how we take action, what Trump should do, because I'm not bragging, you're not bragging, but the White House listens to us, the campaign listens to us.
[02:48:48.242 --> 02:49:00.293]  What do you think we should do to strike back against all of this and just the unbrazen, untethered attacks that we're seeing against free speech right now?
[02:49:00.693 --> 02:49:01.574]  Where do you see it going?
[02:49:02.930 --> 02:49:10.131]  Well, unfortunately, because neither you nor I like to do election stuff, we don't endorse candidates as journalists.
[02:49:10.792 --> 02:49:19.133]  If we, if America loses the House of Representatives and Democrats win in November, we're all like dead.
[02:49:19.153 --> 02:49:22.274]  I don't mean, I don't mean, I don't mean figuratively, Alex.
[02:49:22.374 --> 02:49:23.354]  I get death threats.
[02:49:23.774 --> 02:49:27.235]  There's an active campaign by members of the media
[02:49:27.739 --> 02:49:40.062]  To have me murdered, and I imagine you murdered, had a private security analysis conducted of me, and I've been told by people very, very high levels about the chatter that they're hearing.
[02:49:41.693 --> 02:49:43.413]  Stay there, your sky's breaking up.
[02:49:43.433 --> 02:49:47.535]  But yes, they know they put out a certain amount of propaganda against somebody.
[02:49:47.976 --> 02:49:50.457]  Mentally ill people will try to come kill you.
[02:49:50.957 --> 02:49:55.779]  Just like they advertised in the New York Times where the baseball team was playing to get Scalise shot.
[02:49:55.799 --> 02:49:57.700]  They were planning to take out the leadership.
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:58.961]  They're definitely doing this.
[02:50:00.482 --> 02:50:03.703]  Yeah, that's their game is, oh, you know, they add you to the hate list.
[02:50:03.903 --> 02:50:04.644]  That's what the SPLC
[02:50:06.105 --> 02:50:08.167]  Yeah, actually, LA Times journalist was fired.
[02:50:08.187 --> 02:50:08.768]  Let's talk about this.
[02:50:08.928 --> 02:50:10.770]  LA Times journalist fired for debt threat.
[02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:13.112]  Because, again, you're not even a conservative.
[02:50:13.132 --> 02:50:13.892]  You're more of a libertarian.
[02:50:14.213 --> 02:50:15.774]  They hate you because you're a likable guy.
[02:50:15.794 --> 02:50:21.359]  Yeah, and that's the whole thing is I haven't even been controversial for like a year.
[02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:25.163]  If people wanted to criticize me, a lot of people are like, man, you're boring.
[02:50:25.183 --> 02:50:26.044]  You don't even do anything.
[02:50:26.064 --> 02:50:28.045]  And I'm like, well, yeah, because I feel
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:35.466]  The energy, and we have to calm it down, or it's just going to be mass murder by the left in the street.
[02:50:35.566 --> 02:50:41.871]  And as you know, if the left is in the street murdering people, they will kill innocent people, they will kill children.
[02:50:42.191 --> 02:50:55.142]  So not only Alex did an LA Times reporter get fired for that threatening me, a pedophile who had organized a smear campaign against me when I spoke at Columbia was arrested
[02:50:55.899 --> 02:50:57.941]  For trying to have sex with an eight-year-old.
[02:50:58.121 --> 02:50:59.702]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[02:51:00.042 --> 02:51:00.763]  These are court records.
[02:51:00.783 --> 02:51:02.384]  Now that's on your Twitter, at Cernovich.
[02:51:02.444 --> 02:51:03.205]  And let's explain this.
[02:51:03.825 --> 02:51:05.447]  We'll win a physical civil war.
[02:51:05.527 --> 02:51:06.728]  We don't want to go down that road.
[02:51:07.288 --> 02:51:17.276]  So they're just intensifying the threats, the bizarre behavior, where the LA Times and others think they can threaten to kill you, and now they're shocked, they're getting in trouble.
[02:51:17.316 --> 02:51:19.598]  So tell us about this reported pedophile.
[02:51:20.799 --> 02:51:25.962]  Yeah, so in November of last year, I gave a talk to Columbia on media criticism.
[02:51:26.042 --> 02:51:30.544]  It was a very, you know, very rational talk about media double standards.
[02:51:31.504 --> 02:51:33.265]  He organized a protest against me.
[02:51:34.386 --> 02:51:42.670]  Well, fast forward a few months, he's been arrested for soliciting sex with an eight-year-old
[02:51:43.274 --> 02:51:45.955]  An eight-year-old, Alex, he had pictures of infants.
[02:51:46.335 --> 02:51:49.097]  He said he was interested in zero plus.
[02:51:49.257 --> 02:51:50.177]  That's their code.
[02:51:50.797 --> 02:51:53.438]  And again, people go, oh, this is a conspiracy theory.
[02:51:53.458 --> 02:51:53.819]  No, no, no.
[02:51:54.179 --> 02:51:56.120]  This is official federal court records.
[02:51:56.140 --> 02:51:57.960]  I actually uploaded the full complaint.
[02:51:58.081 --> 02:52:07.365]  The thing is, they keep busting top Hillary Clinton people that are involved in children, quote, immigrating to the U.S.
[02:52:07.925 --> 02:52:09.365]  saying they want to have sex with two-year-olds.
[02:52:09.786 --> 02:52:10.766]  So you've now exposed it.
[02:52:10.806 --> 02:52:12.547]  It's literally a pedophile cult.
[02:52:13.888 --> 02:52:18.649]  Yeah, and not only that, the complaint is so graphic.
[02:52:18.849 --> 02:52:20.969]  And notice, none of this ever hits the news, though.
[02:52:21.470 --> 02:52:24.850]  I mean, Trump is busting pedophiles, what, ten times what it was?
[02:52:24.870 --> 02:52:26.691]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:52:26.711 --> 02:52:27.871]  All the time.
[02:52:28.051 --> 02:52:32.432]  And not only that, but I'm gonna send Daria a picture.
[02:52:33.012 --> 02:52:39.493]  They claim, oh, he had no connection to the Clinton campaign, but before he took down his Instagram,
[02:52:42.964 --> 02:52:46.405]  There were pictures of him at the Clinton campaign headquarters.
[02:52:47.005 --> 02:52:52.726]  Not only that... So that's what I'm saying is, let me ask you, this is a smart guy and a lawyer.
[02:52:54.346 --> 02:52:57.947]  We know there's a lot of pedophiles, but my God, how many Democrats are?
[02:52:57.987 --> 02:52:59.447]  Because I'm realizing it's a cult.
[02:53:02.027 --> 02:53:07.128]  Not only that, Alex, I just reported yesterday at Cernovich.com.
[02:53:07.188 --> 02:53:12.249]  If you go to C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H dot com, I've seen court records
[02:53:12.979 --> 02:53:17.242]  Involving a pedophile who is highly placed within the Bill de Blasio campaign.
[02:53:18.003 --> 02:53:23.487]  He was arrested a year ago with thousands of images of children being raped.
[02:53:24.267 --> 02:53:25.829]  So I go, oh, that was a year ago.
[02:53:25.889 --> 02:53:27.050]  I wonder if he's in jail.
[02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:28.411]  No, no, no.
[02:53:28.511 --> 02:53:30.032]  Official court records again.
[02:53:30.432 --> 02:53:31.753]  Oh, conspiracy theory.
[02:53:31.773 --> 02:53:33.294]  No, you mean official court records?
[02:53:34.055 --> 02:53:35.716]  Nothing has happened in this case.
[02:53:36.243 --> 02:53:40.491]  So what they did, if somebody isn't a lawyer, they don't really understand what they're doing.
[02:53:40.851 --> 02:53:42.955]  What they did is they let him out on $7,500 bail and
[02:53:46.283 --> 02:53:47.204]  Nothing has happened.
[02:53:47.704 --> 02:53:48.664]  No trials.
[02:53:49.145 --> 02:53:49.705]  No nothing.
[02:53:49.745 --> 02:53:50.586]  He just shows up.
[02:53:50.746 --> 02:53:54.628]  Clearly that's how they compromise people.
[02:53:55.048 --> 02:53:56.729]  You've got to be in the club to be part of it.
[02:53:57.170 --> 02:53:58.090]  How big is it?
[02:53:58.110 --> 02:54:01.272]  Because we know Trump's tenfold, at least, busting pedophiles.
[02:54:01.292 --> 02:54:02.353]  That's why they're all panicking.
[02:54:02.753 --> 02:54:10.518]  Yeah, there he is, far-left worker for the Clinton campaign, running a child charity, admitting he raped children, trying to meet with two-year-olds to have sex with them.
[02:54:12.090 --> 02:54:12.851]  Let's put that back up.
[02:54:12.871 --> 02:54:14.472]  He's the guy on the far left there.
[02:54:15.073 --> 02:54:17.855]  I mean, let's name this guy.
[02:54:20.517 --> 02:54:21.018]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:54:25.041 --> 02:54:27.003]  Yeah, so this can't be denied.
[02:54:27.263 --> 02:54:33.268]  And then the media fact check said, oh, he's a campaign person.
[02:54:34.049 --> 02:54:34.810]  He's on Instagram.
[02:54:35.891 --> 02:54:36.251]  Crazy.
[02:54:37.648 --> 02:54:48.854]  So just in a 35,000 foot view, what, what is the, cause normal person's like, even their normal, like a normal straight person's into women, normal gay person's into, you know, their own.
[02:54:49.894 --> 02:54:51.215]  What is this thing with children?
[02:54:51.235 --> 02:54:55.237]  Cause it seems like every time we knock some wall down, it's a bunch of pedophiles.
[02:54:55.277 --> 02:54:56.537]  Like what is going on there?
[02:54:58.618 --> 02:55:03.941]  Yeah, well there's ritualistic practices that they have and it is, um,
[02:55:04.837 --> 02:55:09.400]  Fundamentally, it's the most demonic thing you can do is to harm and trawl.
[02:55:10.201 --> 02:55:17.506]  So that's how they gain power in the Democrat Party is they prove, because ultimately, I mean, it can't be denied anymore.
[02:55:17.866 --> 02:55:21.209]  Trump and the Republicans are the side of God.
[02:55:21.909 --> 02:55:25.251]  The Democrats are now the side of pedophiles.
[02:55:25.532 --> 02:55:30.155]  I mean, Anthony Weiner, Jacob Schwartz, Joel Davis, these aren't nobodies.
[02:55:30.775 --> 02:55:31.976]  These are top level people.
[02:55:32.611 --> 02:55:32.832]  Right?
[02:55:32.892 --> 02:55:34.117]  How many more do we need to see?
[02:55:34.478 --> 02:55:37.229]  I don't see top level Republicans other than Dennis Hastert.
[02:55:37.679 --> 02:55:41.560]  Who was, by the way, he should have been sentenced to death for what he did.
[02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:43.860]  And we've got Express with Epstein.
[02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:47.041]  And we've got Hillary and her own workers bringing kids in illegally.
[02:55:47.401 --> 02:55:54.963]  I mean, Hillary's first job as a lawyer were eight guys that gang raped an 11-year-old girl until her cervix broke and her guts came out.
[02:55:54.983 --> 02:55:57.623]  I mean, I don't want to be gross here, but, I mean, there it is.
[02:55:57.663 --> 02:56:00.904]  Child abuse charity had arrested for attempted child rape.
[02:56:01.804 --> 02:56:02.424]  Unbelievable.
[02:56:03.244 --> 02:56:05.245]  In 2013, too, there was that 2013 report
[02:56:07.315 --> 02:56:15.621]  For like 30 seconds, where even, I think it was Chuck Todd, it was an NBC report, people could find it, the State Department covered up Hetophilia 2013.
[02:56:15.681 --> 02:56:20.304]  This is all like... Well sure, the UN, all of it's been caught.
[02:56:20.704 --> 02:56:23.966]  And so who's the Columbia University student who protested you?
[02:56:23.986 --> 02:56:25.047]  Because it ties into that.
[02:56:25.948 --> 02:56:27.288]  Yeah, he's Joel Davis.
[02:56:27.449 --> 02:56:29.590]  He was the person who was just arrested.
[02:56:30.253 --> 02:56:32.315]  He organized a protest march against me.
[02:56:32.615 --> 02:56:35.398]  Remember when they held up that sign, no pedo-bashing?
[02:56:35.758 --> 02:56:41.244]  And the media goes, oh, that was a false flag operation organized by... because they can be conspiracy theorists, right?
[02:56:41.744 --> 02:56:43.326]  Oh, that was a Cernovich false flag.
[02:56:43.366 --> 02:56:44.567]  But now the guy's been arrested.
[02:56:44.587 --> 02:56:45.388]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:56:47.859 --> 02:56:49.981]  I've admitted that I had girlfriends that had abortions.
[02:56:50.061 --> 02:56:51.802]  I said, I repent to God, I feel bad.
[02:56:51.822 --> 02:56:53.963]  I haven't done it since, I've got four children.
[02:56:54.023 --> 02:56:59.307]  I'm being honest, telling people that have had abortions, don't have to get into it, don't have to say it's right, say you're wrong, repent.
[02:56:59.587 --> 02:57:00.748]  I was telling that to be honest.
[02:57:01.348 --> 02:57:04.571]  But then the left calls in and goes, what's wrong with screwing kids if you've killed them?
[02:57:04.931 --> 02:57:06.392]  Well, I didn't know that was happening.
[02:57:06.892 --> 02:57:07.913]  I was delusional.
[02:57:08.413 --> 02:57:09.294]  My girlfriends did it.
[02:57:09.334 --> 02:57:10.455]  I'm not saying it's okay.
[02:57:11.135 --> 02:57:13.557]  But then their answer is, well, it's okay to have sex with kids.
[02:57:13.957 --> 02:57:15.298]  That's what they're hammering me with.
[02:57:16.857 --> 02:57:19.159]  Well, that's because, that's why they hate us.
[02:57:19.999 --> 02:57:22.562]  They don't, we're anti-war.
[02:57:23.522 --> 02:57:25.604]  We want freedom, prosperity.
[02:57:26.144 --> 02:57:30.308]  We don't want to go to war where children are murdered, by the way, in wars.
[02:57:30.928 --> 02:57:32.810]  So we're the party of peace.
[02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:34.051]  We're the party of prosperity.
[02:57:34.071 --> 02:57:34.551]  That's right.
[02:57:34.591 --> 02:57:35.051]  Stay there.
[02:57:35.131 --> 02:57:36.452]  Back with Mike Cernovich in two minutes.
[02:57:36.472 --> 02:57:36.893]  Stay with us.
[02:57:39.411 --> 02:57:41.535]  InfoWars.com.
[02:57:41.555 --> 02:57:43.579]  The Hayden-Vaughton site.
[02:57:43.819 --> 02:57:45.282]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:57:45.342 --> 02:57:46.444]  Did you spread the links?
[02:57:46.504 --> 02:57:48.268]  None of you criticized for it.
[02:57:48.288 --> 02:57:49.109]  So did George Washington.
[02:57:49.129 --> 02:57:49.851]  Spread the links.
[02:57:52.765 --> 02:58:11.054]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:58:11.155 --> 02:58:17.098]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:58:17.438 --> 02:58:18.118]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:58:18.238 --> 02:58:21.400]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:23.020]  And so much more.
[02:58:23.580 --> 02:58:24.721]  It is concentrated.
[02:58:24.941 --> 02:58:26.641]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:58:26.661 --> 02:58:32.362]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:58:32.462 --> 02:58:33.662]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:58:33.682 --> 02:58:35.602]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:58:35.703 --> 02:58:38.083]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:58:38.283 --> 02:58:39.543]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:58:39.723 --> 02:58:41.544]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:58:42.084 --> 02:58:42.684]  Immune Wall.
[02:58:42.804 --> 02:58:44.124]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:44.224 --> 02:58:45.404]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:55.390 --> 02:58:58.492]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:58:58.532 --> 02:58:59.053]  You're on the air.
[02:58:59.073 --> 02:59:00.234]  Thanks for holding.
[02:59:00.314 --> 02:59:01.094]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:59:01.295 --> 02:59:01.915]  Hey, brother.
[02:59:02.215 --> 02:59:02.575]  Good, man.
[02:59:02.596 --> 02:59:03.396]  Thank you for calling.
[02:59:03.476 --> 02:59:04.037]  Hey, hey.
[02:59:04.137 --> 02:59:08.560]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:15.145]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:59:15.265 --> 02:59:16.966]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:59:17.046 --> 02:59:23.872]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:59:24.292 --> 02:59:25.473]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:59:25.533 --> 02:59:27.975]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:59:28.035 --> 02:59:29.557]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:59:29.937 --> 02:59:31.618]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:59:31.999 --> 02:59:32.739]  And exactly.
[02:59:32.759 --> 02:59:37.023]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:59:37.343 --> 02:59:37.623]  Boom!
[02:59:37.764 --> 02:59:40.586]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:59:40.646 --> 02:59:41.187]  It's amazing.
[02:59:41.247 --> 02:59:42.528]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:59:42.608 --> 02:59:45.470]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:59:55.094 --> 02:59:57.376]  You are receiving this transmission.
[02:59:57.416 --> 03:00:04.604]  You are the Resistance.
[03:00:09.709 --> 03:00:14.754]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.856 --> 03:00:27.268]  I was talking to Mike Cernovich, who's a smart guy, media analyst, lawyer, during the break, and I said, how could they defeat us when humanity's awakening?
[03:00:27.288 --> 03:00:29.351]  And he said, well, they hold the keys to the kingdom.
[03:00:29.391 --> 03:00:35.719]  They have Apple transferred to China, now banning emojis of Taiwan, your phone crashes.
[03:00:36.949 --> 03:00:42.512]  They just aren't willing to implement the censorship fully because they're afraid Congress and Trump might call them out.
[03:00:43.033 --> 03:00:49.897]  And when I've talked to the White House and the President and his supporters lately, I've said, please, they're censoring, they're doing it, do something.
[03:00:49.917 --> 03:00:51.177]  They're like, well, what are they doing?
[03:00:51.778 --> 03:00:52.518]  Write us a report.
[03:00:53.078 --> 03:00:55.960]  So I'm in the process of doing that, but it's here.
[03:00:56.740 --> 03:01:01.143]  And so they are ready to launch on all cylinders, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:01.503 --> 03:01:03.865]  They're ready to try to shut this whole thing down right now.
[03:01:04.938 --> 03:01:12.000]  And so I wanted Mike Cernovich to specifically speak to that and talk to that, because they've got the kill switch in place.
[03:01:12.100 --> 03:01:13.080]  They believe we're idiots.
[03:01:13.701 --> 03:01:14.561]  They're making their move.
[03:01:14.601 --> 03:01:15.181]  Mike Cernovich.
[03:01:16.641 --> 03:01:17.942]  Yeah, they have.
[03:01:18.122 --> 03:01:27.324]  Now YouTube has given $25 million to multi-billion dollar corporations, because somebody explained that to me, why CNN, which is valued at $10 to $15 billion, is getting $25 million.
[03:01:30.086 --> 03:01:31.607]  From YouTube, right?
[03:01:31.647 --> 03:01:32.507]  How does that make any sense?
[03:01:32.907 --> 03:01:36.829]  The SPLC tried to take control of Spotify and censor music.
[03:01:37.390 --> 03:01:43.112]  The SPLC is taking control of who can raise funds for nonprofits on Amazon.
[03:01:43.513 --> 03:01:54.078]  Facebook has outsourced fact checking to websites that have been caught deliberately manufacturing and being dishonest in an effort to get people banned.
[03:01:54.718 --> 03:01:58.400]  One of InfoWars competitors is actually lobbying
[03:01:59.266 --> 03:02:01.187]  Facebook to ban Infowars.
[03:02:01.687 --> 03:02:09.009]  Everywhere you look, the Gestapo, the Gestapo is really trying to surround the patriots.
[03:02:09.169 --> 03:02:12.410]  And that is why I have in-person events.
[03:02:12.590 --> 03:02:15.071]  We have to do more things.
[03:02:15.131 --> 03:02:16.171]  What are they afraid of?
[03:02:16.251 --> 03:02:16.731]  Exactly.
[03:02:16.851 --> 03:02:18.972]  If the Internet goes dark, we got to get Trump.
[03:02:19.352 --> 03:02:21.212]  What should Trump do to try to stop it, though?
[03:02:23.893 --> 03:02:26.174]  Well, I mean, Trump and his people are so out of touch.
[03:02:26.843 --> 03:02:30.987]  That they're not going to do anything, actually, even though they're the ones who are losing it.
[03:02:31.668 --> 03:02:40.777]  So it's fundamentally upon you and others like myself and the Infowarriors who are watching to take action.
[03:02:40.797 --> 03:02:41.758]  Trump is just out of touch.
[03:02:41.778 --> 03:02:42.439]  He's in a bubble.
[03:02:42.959 --> 03:02:49.726]  Because you've got to understand the people around Trump, they know that if the internet is censored, Trump will lose.
[03:02:50.333 --> 03:02:51.554]  They want Trump to lose.
[03:02:51.975 --> 03:02:59.943]  So Trump is not getting, other than Don Jr., Trump is not getting a proper lay of the land of what is happening.
[03:03:00.123 --> 03:03:07.050]  I mean, Trump, for example, when he did a talk with Charlie Kirk, Trump goes, oh, yeah, I mean, Antifa, they're not really hurting anybody.
[03:03:07.530 --> 03:03:14.237]  But John Nolte of Breitbart has documented, I think, over 300 cases of violence against Trump supporters.
[03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:17.853]  And again, the violence is not happening against me.
[03:03:17.893 --> 03:03:26.040]  You know, marginal, oh I'm such a... No, it's the average person that shows up, and then so CNN openly calling for the ban of Infowars off the web, off Facebook.
[03:03:26.441 --> 03:03:28.462]  They are counting on us being country bumpkins.
[03:03:28.823 --> 03:03:30.384]  They're counting on us being stupid.
[03:03:30.744 --> 03:03:34.308]  They're smiling like a pig over a big bowl of crap, thinking we're done.
[03:03:36.069 --> 03:03:39.092]  Yeah, in fact, we have to do more happy hours.
[03:03:39.312 --> 03:03:40.013]  We have to do
[03:03:40.635 --> 03:03:44.077]  More events, we have to do more live input.
[03:03:44.097 --> 03:03:52.141]  Like you and I, for example, we had talked about doing a premiere for Hoax, my documentary on showing who really the fake news is, what you're in.
[03:03:52.582 --> 03:03:58.185]  You know, we've talked about maybe doing a premiere in Austin, you know, sell 5,000 tickets or something like that.
[03:03:59.125 --> 03:04:04.688]  And to show people, like, this is the thing, everywhere I go, and I've been with you in Austin, oh, how you doing?
[03:04:04.808 --> 03:04:07.610]  If you read the newspapers, you would think that I'm a goblin.
[03:04:08.072 --> 03:04:11.115]  That people hide from and think I'm hiding under their bed.
[03:04:11.375 --> 03:04:12.356]  But it's the opposite.
[03:04:12.396 --> 03:04:15.480]  But those people that are awake think we've already had the victory.
[03:04:15.540 --> 03:04:16.841]  No, we just started the war.
[03:04:17.361 --> 03:04:19.023]  Now we're out on the field in the real fight.
[03:04:20.304 --> 03:04:21.045]  Absolutely, Mike.
[03:04:21.145 --> 03:04:22.086]  It is totally on.
[03:04:22.286 --> 03:04:23.408]  And you know, the president...
[03:04:24.448 --> 03:04:26.790]  He has been trying to reach out to people to find out what's going on.
[03:04:26.810 --> 03:04:34.616]  He's figured it all out, but we've got to... Everybody should write articles, messages to the President, briefs to the President, all of you about what's happening.
[03:04:35.017 --> 03:04:36.678]  Reach out to him everywhere and we're going to win.
[03:04:37.459 --> 03:04:37.879]  Stay with us.
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:39.260]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:41.122]  Mike Cernovich, thank you so much.
[03:04:41.162 --> 03:04:44.845]  We'll be right back after this quick break with Mike Adams in studio.
[03:04:53.608 --> 03:04:58.909]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:05:01.770 --> 03:05:07.031]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWars Life.
[03:05:07.751 --> 03:05:11.071]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:05:11.912 --> 03:05:17.473]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:05:19.953 --> 03:05:26.296]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[03:05:27.096 --> 03:05:32.338]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:05:32.959 --> 03:05:40.742]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms
[03:05:41.142 --> 03:05:43.184]  You gotta keep them separated.
[03:06:17.277 --> 03:06:27.743]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:06:30.745 --> 03:06:32.286]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[03:06:32.666 --> 03:06:38.830]  And I tell you all of it, I could literally keep you here all night because the stories are just so unbelievable.
[03:06:40.311 --> 03:06:42.072]  This is coming to a theater near you.
[03:06:46.835 --> 03:06:50.719]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[03:06:51.199 --> 03:06:53.681]  He's been called a freak show and downright dangerous.
[03:06:53.701 --> 03:06:57.385]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[03:06:57.525 --> 03:06:58.405]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:58.486 --> 03:06:59.627]  InfoWorth.com.
[03:06:59.727 --> 03:07:00.708]  I'm here to warn people!
[03:07:00.748 --> 03:07:02.029]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[03:07:02.309 --> 03:07:03.190]  This isn't a game!
[03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:11.999]  The fact is that he is an unalloyed racist, a man who's out there pulling the pin on the grenade every day, and he has six million viewers.
[03:07:12.119 --> 03:07:16.804]  He is somebody who President Trump called after the election to thank him for his role.
[03:07:16.865 --> 03:07:19.247]  Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign.
[03:07:19.267 --> 03:07:23.251]  The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that
[03:07:33.076 --> 03:07:37.658]  People have free speech in this country, no matter how hateful, no matter how stupid, no matter how inane.
[03:07:38.118 --> 03:07:40.279]  Give them their time, give them Thorazine also.
[03:07:40.599 --> 03:07:43.101]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[03:07:43.241 --> 03:07:48.183]  If something popped up in a Facebook feed and looked like a news report,
[03:07:48.923 --> 03:07:50.804]  People were inclined to believe it.
[03:07:51.305 --> 03:08:02.311]  And if they were already targeted psychologically to be receptive to the information provided, they were influenceable.
[03:08:02.351 --> 03:08:03.832]  Where are you getting this information?
[03:08:04.372 --> 03:08:06.113]  From a very reputable source.
[03:08:06.414 --> 03:08:06.674]  What?
[03:08:06.734 --> 03:08:07.494]  The FBI?
[03:08:07.534 --> 03:08:08.195]  The CIA?
[03:08:08.355 --> 03:08:09.335]  InfoWars.
[03:08:09.415 --> 03:08:11.397]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[03:08:12.257 --> 03:08:13.178]  You know, he's legit.
[03:08:13.318 --> 03:08:15.480]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[03:08:15.540 --> 03:08:21.744]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[03:08:22.165 --> 03:08:24.846]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[03:08:25.087 --> 03:08:29.370]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.790 --> 03:08:49.215]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYCTerroristAttack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline,
[03:08:50.915 --> 03:08:53.456]  I warned de Blasio about New York City terror.
[03:08:53.536 --> 03:08:55.216]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[03:08:55.416 --> 03:09:05.259]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[03:09:05.599 --> 03:09:12.901]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[03:09:12.961 --> 03:09:15.221]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:09:15.621 --> 03:09:17.942]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[03:09:18.820 --> 03:09:20.301]  Your reputation's amazing.
[03:09:20.681 --> 03:09:22.022]  I will not let you down.
[03:09:22.162 --> 03:09:25.063]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:09:25.143 --> 03:09:31.087]  He still calls Alex Jones and talks to him and, you know, the Info Wars.
[03:09:31.387 --> 03:09:32.087]  Info Wars.
[03:09:32.127 --> 03:09:33.228]  Conspiracy theories.
[03:09:33.268 --> 03:09:34.649]  Conspiracy theories.
[03:09:34.809 --> 03:09:42.313]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[03:09:43.923 --> 03:09:45.945]  The Russians ran an extensive information war.
[03:10:02.466 --> 03:10:09.213]  campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[03:10:09.633 --> 03:10:23.688]  They did it through false news sites, they did it through these thousand agents, they did it through machine learning, which you know kept spewing out this stuff over and over again, and they began to have some of their allies within the
[03:10:24.889 --> 03:10:25.910]  We're good to go.
[03:10:37.225 --> 03:10:46.674]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:10:46.714 --> 03:10:48.515]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:10:48.555 --> 03:10:57.644]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[03:10:58.790 --> 03:11:01.331]  Infowars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[03:11:01.431 --> 03:11:07.514]  It's been widely reported that that company's been backed by the Kremlin and they gave you 75,000 shares that you had to disclose.
[03:11:07.534 --> 03:11:08.855]  They didn't give me anything.
[03:11:08.875 --> 03:11:10.736]  When you went into the Obama administration.
[03:11:10.856 --> 03:11:16.298]  Maybe you're looking at widely reported information from Infowars.
[03:11:16.358 --> 03:11:16.758]  No, I'm not.
[03:11:16.778 --> 03:11:17.479]  But it is not true.
[03:11:17.499 --> 03:11:17.779]  No, I'm not.
[03:11:17.799 --> 03:11:18.479]  This is Politico.
[03:11:18.499 --> 03:11:19.620]  This is the New York Times.
[03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:20.520]  This is the Wall Street Journal.
[03:11:20.680 --> 03:11:21.401]  No, it's not.
[03:11:21.421 --> 03:11:33.110]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[03:11:33.451 --> 03:11:38.835]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[03:11:39.275 --> 03:11:46.041]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source, but has made no further comments about the case.
[03:11:46.381 --> 03:11:48.483]  That murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[03:11:48.703 --> 03:12:00.511]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counterintel people I've talked to, could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[03:12:00.711 --> 03:12:02.132]  All that stuff exists.
[03:12:02.592 --> 03:12:06.475]  You don't see it, you don't feel it if you're largely living in...
[03:12:06.975 --> 03:12:07.335]  I think.
[03:12:23.184 --> 03:12:29.168]  Do what they can to essentially not enhance this.
[03:12:29.248 --> 03:12:34.912]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight?
[03:12:35.132 --> 03:12:36.253]  The system self-corrected.
[03:12:36.353 --> 03:12:39.215]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[03:12:39.235 --> 03:12:41.456]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[03:12:42.657 --> 03:12:43.458]  But you saw this?
[03:12:43.638 --> 03:12:44.418]  USA Today.
[03:12:44.819 --> 03:12:45.639]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[03:12:45.699 --> 03:12:48.341]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[03:12:48.621 --> 03:12:49.782]  That man's a threat to this country.
[03:12:49.962 --> 03:12:51.543]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[03:12:51.563 --> 03:12:53.404]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[03:12:53.424 --> 03:13:01.049]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[03:13:01.069 --> 03:13:06.512]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[03:13:09.414 --> 03:13:13.977]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:13:14.197 --> 03:13:15.558]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:13:18.217 --> 03:13:21.119]  This is Mike Adams jumping into the seat here on an extraordinary day.
[03:13:21.159 --> 03:13:25.142]  Thank you for continuing with us in the fourth hour of this broadcast.
[03:13:25.622 --> 03:13:31.806]  We've got coming up ten quick questions that Peter Strzok needs to be asked by Congress.
[03:13:31.886 --> 03:13:37.029]  I've got other lists of why we can never let leftists gain power over us again.
[03:13:37.950 --> 03:13:46.093]  There is a multifaceted war taking place right now against not just America, but those who are trying to defend against America.
[03:13:46.653 --> 03:13:55.036]  The attacks are being ramped up on InfoWars, on Alex Jones, on people like Mike Cernovich, who you just heard from, and even people like myself as well.
[03:13:55.076 --> 03:14:01.758]  We're all under extreme attack, and the deep state traitors and liars are sitting there
[03:14:02.558 --> 03:14:08.402]  In Congress, in front of Congress, and telling us that they aren't biased, that they didn't do anything wrong.
[03:14:08.742 --> 03:14:21.331]  The very people who I believe need to be indicted, who need to be arrested and held for trial, they need to be brought up on charges for attempting to overthrow this constitutional republic.
[03:14:21.791 --> 03:14:30.677]  Conspiracy, racketeering, corruption, the number of violations of crime, the number of criminal violations they have engaged in is huge.
[03:14:31.077 --> 03:14:31.998]  Destruction of evidence.
[03:14:32.518 --> 03:14:35.580]  Look at Hillary Clinton destroying the evidence and getting away with it.
[03:14:35.680 --> 03:14:35.960]  Why?
[03:14:36.420 --> 03:14:39.502]  Because other people like Peter Strzok helped cover it up.
[03:14:39.782 --> 03:14:46.706]  And then now we learn that Peter Strzok himself got to be the one to vet which of his texts were forwarded to Congress.
[03:14:47.611 --> 03:14:53.436]  Where the FBI, under the leadership of James Comey at that time, believed that it was above the law?
[03:14:54.136 --> 03:14:57.699]  Believed that Congress has no oversight over the FBI?
[03:14:58.099 --> 03:14:59.701]  Get a grip on reality, people!
[03:15:00.381 --> 03:15:01.622]  We gotta take our country back.
[03:15:02.503 --> 03:15:10.829]  And the only way we're gonna do that is to hold these people accountable for the crimes that they have committed over and over again, and they're still lying to our faces every day.
[03:15:11.930 --> 03:15:16.417]  It is a parade of criminality, corruption, and incompetence.
[03:15:16.998 --> 03:15:24.688]  And the cost that we are going to pay if we don't get a grip on this is we're going to lose our country if we don't get a grip on it.
[03:15:27.654 --> 03:15:29.555]  Stay with us here, folks.
[03:15:30.035 --> 03:15:31.436]  We've got some more, a lot coming up.
[03:15:31.836 --> 03:15:35.438]  This is Mike Adams here filling in for the fourth hour at InfoWars.
[03:15:35.698 --> 03:15:36.058]  Stay with us.
[03:15:36.078 --> 03:15:40.680]  We'll be right back after this coming break with much more straight ahead.
[03:15:40.700 --> 03:15:42.161]  We're fighting for everything that matters.
[03:15:42.501 --> 03:15:43.201]  Fighting for our future.
[03:16:05.219 --> 03:16:10.463]  July 4th, 2018 is now here.
[03:16:10.523 --> 03:16:18.568]  240 plus years after we declared our intent to sever our ties with the corrupt King of England.
[03:16:19.389 --> 03:16:28.435]  And I was driving into the Infowars News Center just last week, and it hit me like a thunderbolt, like lightning, that this is the crossroads.
[03:16:29.773 --> 03:16:32.075]  The revolution against the globalists is happening.
[03:16:32.415 --> 03:16:34.357]  Their counter-revolution is taking place.
[03:16:34.977 --> 03:16:41.523]  Antifa and George Soros and the globalists are launching riots and violence and race war and economic war all over the planet.
[03:16:41.543 --> 03:16:43.084]  And it hit me.
[03:16:43.524 --> 03:16:46.186]  This, July 4th, 2018, is the binary twin
[03:16:52.273 --> 03:16:54.695]  of 1776, metaphysically.
[03:16:55.275 --> 03:16:55.756]  This is it.
[03:16:56.236 --> 03:16:58.218]  It is the jump point.
[03:16:58.438 --> 03:17:06.484]  It is the point of no return for the tyrants to defeat us or for humanity to struggle free and control its own destiny.
[03:17:07.165 --> 03:17:19.014]  Ladies and gentlemen, everyone from Michael Moore to Bill Maher to Barack Obama, the communist organizer,
[03:17:20.239 --> 03:17:32.627]  are behind the scenes right now and out in the open trying to foment America destroying itself and Europe destroying itself and Latin America destroying itself.
[03:17:32.647 --> 03:17:34.128]  They're trying to pull us apart.
[03:17:34.368 --> 03:17:35.889]  They're trying to block prosperity.
[03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:46.216]  And they're getting more and more and more and more and more desperate as Trump and other nationalist populist leaders on the left and right
[03:17:47.022 --> 03:17:54.265]  From Italy to the US, restore prosperity by simply blocking globalism that is designed to make us poor.
[03:17:55.126 --> 03:17:57.046]  They're trying to create giant monopolies.
[03:17:57.066 --> 03:18:03.249]  They're trying to kill any true free market systems because then they'll have complete and total social control.
[03:18:03.289 --> 03:18:04.950]  So this July 4th, 2018 is so special.
[03:18:07.731 --> 03:18:18.881]  It is the new Declaration of Independence against the globalists, the Declaration of Independence against big tech, the Declaration of Independence against Hollywood, and all these control freaks that lust after controlling our minds.
[03:18:19.822 --> 03:18:33.213]  Despite all the censorship, all the attacks, all the Soros and Hillary funded lawsuits, we are steaming forward, having huge victory, and working with powerful patriots across the world to change human destiny.
[03:18:34.093 --> 03:18:44.003]  That's why this July 4th and for a few days after, for the next week or so, we're offering some of the biggest sales ever on more than 20 items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:44.523 --> 03:18:46.345]  We're not funded by megacorporations.
[03:18:46.405 --> 03:18:49.248]  We don't get taxpayer bailouts like MSNBC.
[03:18:49.548 --> 03:18:50.449]  We're funded by you.
[03:18:50.489 --> 03:18:55.354]  We make it easy to support InfoWars because the products are great and they're very, very affordable.
[03:18:55.874 --> 03:19:01.399]  But for the 4th of July, we have some of the biggest sales we've had since Christmas on our best sellers.
[03:19:01.939 --> 03:19:03.581]  I can't list them all, there's more than 20.

[03:19:18.630 --> 03:19:19.670]  It's all free shipping.
[03:19:20.050 --> 03:19:22.971]  It's all 40% to 50% off.
[03:19:23.091 --> 03:19:24.812]  Alexa Pure Breezes, amazing.
[03:19:24.832 --> 03:19:26.452]  $100 off on those.
[03:19:26.492 --> 03:19:29.453]  Storable Foods, 50% off on 3-month supply.

[03:19:35.495 --> 03:19:43.039]  This is how you get great products that make your life better, but also fund the information war against the globalists who we are so close to defeating.
[03:19:43.440 --> 03:19:47.242]  Again, for myself, the entire InfoWars crew and family, you are the InfoWar.
[03:19:47.602 --> 03:19:48.383]  You are the victory.
[03:19:48.403 --> 03:19:49.103]  You're the solution.
[03:19:49.303 --> 03:19:50.204]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:19:50.464 --> 03:19:53.225]  So I commend and thank you all for supporting InfoWars.
[03:19:53.546 --> 03:19:54.386]  Now, God bless you.
[03:19:54.666 --> 03:19:57.428]  And remember, this Fourth of July is more important than ever.
[03:20:04.139 --> 03:20:06.727]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:27.498 --> 03:20:35.199]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:20:38.996 --> 03:20:41.937]  The new InfoWars official app has been launched.
[03:20:41.957 --> 03:20:45.378]  You can download that right now at InfoWars.com slash app.
[03:20:45.918 --> 03:20:47.379]  It has major improvements.
[03:20:47.419 --> 03:20:48.059]  Highly recommend it.
[03:20:48.079 --> 03:20:49.460]  You can watch the live broadcast.

[03:20:53.421 --> 03:20:55.522]  There's a lot more on the app.
[03:20:55.802 --> 03:20:58.403]  It's a brand new, a new version of the app.
[03:20:58.423 --> 03:21:02.404]  So check it out at InfoWars.com slash app, A-P-P.
[03:21:02.804 --> 03:21:03.945]  InfoWars.com slash app.
[03:21:04.005 --> 03:21:04.105]  Now,
[03:21:04.705 --> 03:21:16.374]  Every day that I am invited to come in here, I'm humbled by what is at stake and the fact that we need to lend a voice to the big, big questions here.
[03:21:16.514 --> 03:21:21.758]  Right now, there are ten questions that we need to ask Peter Strzok.
[03:21:22.118 --> 03:21:23.559]  Ten big questions.
[03:21:24.220 --> 03:21:30.725]  This one comes from Joe Hoft over at the Gateway Pundit right now, but there's five of these questions that I've got to mention here.
[03:21:31.385 --> 03:21:35.526]  Number one, was Jeff Sessions involved in spying on the Trump campaign?
[03:21:36.106 --> 03:21:36.767]  Big question.
[03:21:37.187 --> 03:21:38.167]  Where is Jeff Sessions?
[03:21:38.627 --> 03:21:42.708]  Why does he seem to be backing off of his job?
[03:21:43.148 --> 03:21:45.209]  Why does he almost seem complicit in this?
[03:21:45.229 --> 03:21:48.170]  I mean, I don't have any evidence that he's a traitor.
[03:21:48.190 --> 03:21:49.950]  I'm not saying he's a traitor or anything like that.
[03:21:50.470 --> 03:21:51.431]  But where are you, man?
[03:21:52.051 --> 03:21:53.691]  Jeff Sessions, you're the Attorney General.
[03:21:53.751 --> 03:21:55.312]  You are supposed to be
[03:21:56.357 --> 03:22:01.482]  Issuing arrest warrants for the traitors, the deep state operatives who are trying to overthrow this country.
[03:22:02.102 --> 03:22:05.125]  Was Jeff Sessions involved in the spying on the Trump campaign?
[03:22:05.905 --> 03:22:06.546]  One key question.
[03:22:07.166 --> 03:22:08.588]  The next big question.
[03:22:09.108 --> 03:22:13.152]  This is a question that should be mentioned to Strzok or asked of Strzok.
[03:22:13.472 --> 03:22:17.716]  Were you or anyone you are aware of involved in the transfer of U.S.
[03:22:17.816 --> 03:22:18.716]  uranium to Russia?
[03:22:19.580 --> 03:22:27.568]  Because you know what, when you look at the Uranium One deal, and you look at Hillary Clinton, you find that Robert Mueller was involved back then.
[03:22:28.209 --> 03:22:29.691]  And you find that the State Department
[03:22:30.629 --> 03:22:36.012]  Was involved in some of the cover-ups related to, you know, uranium supplies.
[03:22:37.273 --> 03:22:40.335]  Uranium, this is a national security interest.
[03:22:40.835 --> 03:22:47.519]  This is a rare element that is of course used for nuclear weapons development.
[03:22:47.999 --> 03:22:50.921]  And then we find out that Obama funneled $33.6 billion to Iran?
[03:22:54.045 --> 03:22:54.105]  And
[03:23:11.454 --> 03:23:14.234]  The chokeholds on Iran that were in place?
[03:23:14.775 --> 03:23:24.236]  I mean, there are some big questions here involving Barack Obama, Robert Mueller, Hillary Clinton, Peter Strzok, and he seems to be, Peter Strzok seems to be in the middle of all this.
[03:23:24.916 --> 03:23:40.499]  Covering up Hillary Clinton's emails, covering up his own texts to Lisa Page, covering up the crimes of the deep state while launching this outrageous, fake, hoax, Russia collusion narrative that itself is tearing this country apart.
[03:23:41.690 --> 03:23:49.239]  And I will read some of the quotes from Peter Strzok to show you how he is in a state of absolute denial about what is going on.
[03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:51.062]  No, actually, no, he knows.
[03:23:51.262 --> 03:23:51.823]  He's just lying.
[03:23:52.303 --> 03:23:53.765]  He is lying to you.
[03:23:53.845 --> 03:23:54.866]  He's lying to America.
[03:23:55.507 --> 03:23:58.491]  And he has been lying all day, and thank God,
[03:23:59.412 --> 03:24:06.494]  For Trey Gowdy up there asking some tough questions and acting like the prosecutor that he has been in the past.
[03:24:06.894 --> 03:24:08.195]  It's time to get tough, people.
[03:24:08.375 --> 03:24:10.516]  It's time to realize the war is here.
[03:24:11.036 --> 03:24:12.676]  There is a war for America.
[03:24:12.996 --> 03:24:20.119]  And if you don't wake up and realize that we're fighting a war right now, a war to exist in the online space, a war for free speech,
[03:24:21.112 --> 03:24:22.674]  A war to protect America's borders.
[03:24:23.575 --> 03:24:31.403]  A war for the basic rules of law and order because the radical left today wants absolute lawlessness all across America.
[03:24:31.704 --> 03:24:32.925]  It's not just sanctuary cities.
[03:24:33.286 --> 03:24:34.407]  It's not just the open borders.
[03:24:34.627 --> 03:24:40.453]  They want to shut down all the prisons and release the violent prisoners into the streets of America and probably shut down the police as well.
[03:24:40.794 --> 03:24:41.334]  I'll get to that.
[03:24:41.895 --> 03:24:42.556]  There's more coming.
[03:24:44.039 --> 03:24:46.180]  Here's the next question for Peter Strzok.
[03:24:46.500 --> 03:24:54.085]  Did you sign off on the review of the more than 300,000 emails found on Wiener's laptop in less than a week of review?
[03:24:54.145 --> 03:24:59.188]  I mean, who covered up the Wiener laptop emails?
[03:24:59.988 --> 03:25:06.152]  And question number nine out of that list, did you see any evidence of crimes against children in these emails?
[03:25:07.150 --> 03:25:10.951]  Because the Inspector General notes that there were such emails found.
[03:25:11.191 --> 03:25:11.551]  You know what?
[03:25:11.811 --> 03:25:24.314]  It seems to me, and this is just an educated guess, but I'm willing to bet you that Peter Strzok is involved in the cover-up of evidence of serious crimes against children.
[03:25:25.554 --> 03:25:27.695]  Evidence that was held by Anthony Weiner.
[03:25:28.999 --> 03:25:33.920]  And Huma Abedin, and was probably very well known by Hillary Clinton herself.
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:35.001]  Now that's just conjecture.
[03:25:35.261 --> 03:25:36.141]  I don't have proof of that.
[03:25:36.801 --> 03:25:47.204]  But you gotta start connecting the dots here and realize that there is a cover-up that is so deep, that is so egregious, that is so maliciously anti-American.
[03:25:47.844 --> 03:25:51.765]  How did we, the people, how did we allow the FBI?
[03:25:52.941 --> 03:25:55.303]  Under James Comey and people like Peter Strzok.
[03:25:55.603 --> 03:26:00.427]  How did we allow the FBI to become a weapon against this constitutional republic?
[03:26:01.208 --> 03:26:02.068]  How did this happen?
[03:26:02.589 --> 03:26:06.712]  And for God's sake, how does Jeff Sessions still sit there and allow this to happen?
[03:26:07.933 --> 03:26:10.835]  And I know you're listening to this and in your own mind you might have answers to that.
[03:26:11.155 --> 03:26:12.737]  You might think, well, Jeff Sessions is a traitor.
[03:26:12.777 --> 03:26:14.338]  Jeff Sessions has been compromised.
[03:26:14.438 --> 03:26:15.879]  Honestly, we don't know the answer to that yet.
[03:26:16.439 --> 03:26:17.260]  Maybe he'll come around.
[03:26:18.001 --> 03:26:21.483]  Maybe Trump will fire him and get someone in there like
[03:26:22.589 --> 03:26:28.612]  Andrew Napolitano, who will actually assert the law as it is supposed to be done in this country.
[03:26:28.932 --> 03:26:29.553]  But there you go.
[03:26:30.373 --> 03:26:32.114]  Ten big questions that need to be asked.
[03:26:32.154 --> 03:26:33.414]  I didn't cover all ten.
[03:26:34.495 --> 03:26:36.096]  But let's go to Peter Strzok's quotes.
[03:26:36.296 --> 03:26:37.937]  Some of these came out of testimony today.
[03:26:38.837 --> 03:26:42.419]  He denies that he's biased against President Trump.
[03:26:42.439 --> 03:26:50.163]  I mean, even though this is the guy who was caught, think about it, he was caught texting Lisa Page and saying that
[03:26:51.992 --> 03:26:53.013]  We will stop him?
[03:26:54.494 --> 03:26:54.934]  Wait a minute.
[03:26:55.755 --> 03:26:57.676]  Yeah, Peter Strzok, wasn't he the one who said that?
[03:26:58.076 --> 03:26:58.937]  That we will stop him?
[03:26:58.977 --> 03:27:02.720]  When Lisa Page was saying, oh my god, he's not going to be president, is he?
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:03.140]  Is he?
[03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:04.061]  I mean, I'm paraphrasing.
[03:27:04.681 --> 03:27:07.523]  And I believe his answer was, we will stop him.
[03:27:08.123 --> 03:27:09.985]  Or, we will stop them.
[03:27:10.005 --> 03:27:11.986]  I'm paraphrasing.
[03:27:12.026 --> 03:27:12.767]  It's very similar to that.
[03:27:13.427 --> 03:27:14.168]  Who is the we?
[03:27:15.408 --> 03:27:17.350]  Who is this we that he is talking about?
[03:27:17.690 --> 03:27:18.390]  Well, it's obvious.
[03:27:18.431 --> 03:27:20.172]  The we is the corrupt FBI.
[03:27:21.417 --> 03:27:37.422]  The we is the corrupt leadership that had already decided to overthrow the presidency of the United States, to overthrow the will of the voters, to interfere with the election.
[03:27:37.582 --> 03:27:38.342]  They tried this.
[03:27:38.982 --> 03:27:45.387]  Before the election, they had injected spies into the Trump campaign before the election.
[03:27:45.807 --> 03:27:49.970]  They tried to create a pretext for seeking a FISA warrant.
[03:27:50.350 --> 03:27:53.333]  They lied to the judge that signed off on the FISA warrant.
[03:27:53.993 --> 03:27:57.415]  They covered their tracks every step of the way, and then they went back.
[03:27:58.015 --> 03:28:12.384]  After Trump got elected, they went back and tried to create more pretext documentation to justify their actions in a blatant attempt to try to say that they weren't committing treason, that they weren't interfering with the election, and then they blamed it all on Russia.
[03:28:13.317 --> 03:28:22.545]  So everything that Peter Strzok was doing, and James Comey was doing, and others, you know, James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, it's a long list, right?
[03:28:22.725 --> 03:28:24.266]  Loretta Lynch, it's a big list.
[03:28:24.927 --> 03:28:34.295]  All the things that they were doing to actively interfere with the election in the United States, they blamed Russia for doing, and they just made it up.
[03:28:34.835 --> 03:28:41.099]  And the fake news media ran with that narrative hook, line, and sinker, and they've been lying about it ever since.
[03:28:41.659 --> 03:28:46.702]  To this day, this has not been resolved, and I don't know about you, but I'm about fed up with it.
[03:28:47.202 --> 03:28:52.545]  It's time to arrest these deep state traitors, charge them with the crimes they've committed, and take our country back!
[03:28:53.345 --> 03:28:53.806]  It's time.
[03:28:54.266 --> 03:28:54.666]  Stay with me.
[03:28:54.686 --> 03:28:56.247]  We'll be right back here on InfoWars.
[03:29:00.971 --> 03:29:04.555]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[03:29:04.955 --> 03:29:07.398]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[03:29:07.698 --> 03:29:12.063]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[03:29:12.503 --> 03:29:14.385]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[03:29:14.926 --> 03:29:21.273]  Available in 1 oz, 3.5 oz, and 16 oz bottles, Immune Gargle is perfect for the bathroom, kitchen,
[03:29:21.613 --> 03:29:22.454]  Or wherever you go.
[03:29:23.014 --> 03:29:29.239]  The incredible new purifying formula is dentist recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.
[03:29:29.719 --> 03:29:37.325]  As a powerful hand purifier or oral cleansing formula, just a small spray will help you stay clean when you feel surrounded by toxins.
[03:29:37.846 --> 03:29:44.631]  With powerful, yet simple ingredients, Immune Gargle features Silver Soul Nano Silver for a powerful cleansing alternative.
[03:29:45.051 --> 03:29:49.678]  With Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle, staying toxin free is easy and affordable.
[03:29:50.239 --> 03:29:55.047]  Help stop the spread of toxins and stay healthy with Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[03:29:55.547 --> 03:29:57.791]  Only available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:29:58.211 --> 03:30:00.134]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:01.041 --> 03:30:04.482]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:30:04.502 --> 03:30:07.763]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:30:08.284 --> 03:30:14.086]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:30:14.546 --> 03:30:17.327]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:30:18.067 --> 03:30:21.509]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:30:21.889 --> 03:30:27.951]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:30:28.352 --> 03:30:33.314]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:30:34.062 --> 03:30:37.484]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:30:37.985 --> 03:30:44.529]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:30:45.190 --> 03:30:49.813]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:30:50.413 --> 03:30:55.517]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:30:56.097 --> 03:31:00.080]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:31:00.621 --> 03:31:06.665]  The scientists at InfoWars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[03:31:07.005 --> 03:31:09.607]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[03:31:10.228 --> 03:31:13.670]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:31:13.930 --> 03:31:16.012]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years.
[03:31:16.212 --> 03:31:18.153]  And is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:31:18.613 --> 03:31:21.874]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:31:22.774 --> 03:31:32.997]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:31:33.757 --> 03:31:38.358]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients.
[03:31:38.819 --> 03:31:42.300]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[03:31:43.940 --> 03:31:52.485]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[03:31:52.986 --> 03:31:57.268]  Try Bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[03:32:00.566 --> 03:32:03.748]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:32:04.208 --> 03:32:05.529]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:32:06.009 --> 03:32:17.457]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:32:18.237 --> 03:32:27.140]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:32:27.500 --> 03:32:38.244]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:32:38.764 --> 03:32:41.086]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:32:41.426 --> 03:32:42.787]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:32:43.167 --> 03:32:52.793]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:32:52.893 --> 03:32:55.035]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:32:55.575 --> 03:33:00.478]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[03:33:05.081 --> 03:33:07.763]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.277 --> 03:33:29.533]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.837 --> 03:33:42.763]  You know, it's times like this that that internal anger comes out in all of us when we see the attacks on our great nation and the attacks on our constitutional republic.
[03:33:43.343 --> 03:33:47.465]  But, you know, we also we have a tremendous amount to be thankful for as well.
[03:33:47.525 --> 03:33:49.506]  I mean, aren't you thankful that Infowars is here?
[03:33:49.926 --> 03:33:56.110]  Aren't you thankful that we have this freedom of expression that's still here, even though with all the censorship,
[03:33:56.730 --> 03:34:01.936]  With all of the attempts to smear InfoWars or my operation as well.
[03:34:02.297 --> 03:34:05.881]  All the attempts to blacklist us and take us down, take us offline.
[03:34:06.658 --> 03:34:07.658]  We are here.
[03:34:08.418 --> 03:34:10.239]  We are fighting for America.
[03:34:10.679 --> 03:34:13.660]  We are fighting for liberty actually on a global basis.
[03:34:14.060 --> 03:34:15.500]  We want the whole world to be free.
[03:34:16.040 --> 03:34:18.881]  We want individual liberty to be a universal principle.
[03:34:18.901 --> 03:34:21.442]  It's not just limited to America.
[03:34:22.002 --> 03:34:26.083]  We believe that every nation has the right to defend its borders.
[03:34:26.423 --> 03:34:33.305]  We believe that every citizen everywhere in the world should have access to natural cannabis medicine, for example.
[03:34:33.985 --> 03:34:49.545]  We believe in the basic health freedom rights to say no to a medical intervention that you don't want, whether it's a mandatory vaccine in California or the forced gunpoint chemotherapy injection of your child by a rogue police state medical system.
[03:34:49.605 --> 03:34:50.566]  We believe in liberty.
[03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:52.981]  For all people everywhere around the world.
[03:34:53.641 --> 03:34:59.025]  And we are building platforms, and we are building tools to accomplish that.
[03:34:59.485 --> 03:35:00.786]  And we are exercising our freedom.
[03:35:00.806 --> 03:35:03.247]  Of course, CNN trying to shut down InfoWars now.
[03:35:03.287 --> 03:35:08.991]  Of course, once again, trying to say that InfoWars should be banned on Facebook, should be banned on YouTube.
[03:35:09.311 --> 03:35:11.172]  I mean, I've been completely banned on YouTube.
[03:35:11.492 --> 03:35:12.813]  But look, some good news.
[03:35:13.354 --> 03:35:15.715]  And I know Alex supports this project, so I'll mention it.
[03:35:16.255 --> 03:35:18.177]  We now have Reel.Video in beta.
[03:35:18.977 --> 03:35:19.978]  It is functioning.
[03:35:20.398 --> 03:35:24.742]  We are now getting videos there that have been banned by YouTube.
[03:35:25.542 --> 03:35:30.106]  You can just go to beta.real.video or just go to real.video and there's a link there.
[03:35:30.506 --> 03:35:32.227]  But we're in a beta launch phase.
[03:35:32.247 --> 03:35:35.290]  We've got like 500 to 1,000 videos live up there right now.
[03:35:35.530 --> 03:35:42.215]  And I just talked with Rob Dew before the segment and InfoWars is going to get a channel up there.
[03:35:42.275 --> 03:35:43.276]  It's already been reserved for them.
[03:35:43.296 --> 03:35:46.478]  They're going to start uploading and we'll have InfoWars content up there as well.
[03:35:47.319 --> 03:35:49.561]  And I hope Mike Cernovich joins and many others.
[03:35:49.581 --> 03:35:51.142]  There's already some great personalities on there.
[03:35:51.563 --> 03:35:53.104]  We are building platforms, people!
[03:35:53.865 --> 03:35:57.188]  And Alex is building, you know, a new studio here.
[03:35:58.109 --> 03:36:00.370]  An impressive, amazing new studio.
[03:36:00.431 --> 03:36:03.813]  I can't wait for that to go live, because this studio is impressive right here.
[03:36:04.054 --> 03:36:05.055]  But there's another one coming.
[03:36:05.731 --> 03:36:13.999]  And there are more shows joining, and there's more syndication of this content, and at the same time, my organization is launching more websites every day.
[03:36:14.219 --> 03:36:18.503]  It's just, the idea of liberty and freedom is spreading.
[03:36:19.363 --> 03:36:22.206]  And we have a fighting chance.
[03:36:22.586 --> 03:36:23.667]  See, this is the good news, people.
[03:36:23.907 --> 03:36:24.888]  We have a fighting chance.
[03:36:25.709 --> 03:36:29.111]  To actually save this republic with President Trump in the White House.
[03:36:29.191 --> 03:36:32.994]  Thank God that Hillary Clinton didn't win that election.
[03:36:33.194 --> 03:36:38.558]  Or can you imagine if we didn't have Neil Gorsuch there on the court, if Hillary Clinton had named that justice?
[03:36:39.577 --> 03:36:43.518]  If Hillary Clinton had named a second one instead of Brett Kavanaugh?
[03:36:43.538 --> 03:36:48.959]  I mean, can you imagine the destruction of our Constitution and our liberties?
[03:36:48.979 --> 03:36:51.920]  I mean, the border would be obliterated already.
[03:36:52.160 --> 03:36:58.141]  There would be a flood of invading foreign nationals just flooding and occupying and taking over our country.
[03:36:58.441 --> 03:37:00.902]  And Hillary Clinton would say that that's humanitarian!
[03:37:01.482 --> 03:37:13.454]  That that's equality while your country is just flushed down the toilet and turned into a third world craphole as so many of these countries have gone when socialists and radical communists are in charge.
[03:37:14.335 --> 03:37:16.057]  So count your blessings today, people.
[03:37:17.218 --> 03:37:17.918]  Count your blessings.
[03:37:18.379 --> 03:37:19.360]  Trump is in the White House.
[03:37:20.061 --> 03:37:21.042]  Infowars is here.
[03:37:22.168 --> 03:37:23.390]  We are building platforms.
[03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:31.440]  We still can express our ideas rooted in reason and logic and history and fundamental freedoms.
[03:37:32.581 --> 03:37:34.463]  We have not become Venezuela.
[03:37:34.864 --> 03:37:35.264]  Not yet!
[03:37:36.212 --> 03:37:39.994]  Gotta keep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez out of the White House, you know?
[03:37:40.454 --> 03:37:41.735]  She's not gonna have a chance there.
[03:37:42.035 --> 03:37:45.157]  She would turn America into Venezuela, but that has not happened.
[03:37:45.958 --> 03:38:00.686]  So count your blessings, people, because we have a fighting chance, and as long as you support this organization, and you support the sharing of information, we have a fighting chance to take our country back and keep it alive as a constitutional republic.
[03:38:01.006 --> 03:38:04.929]  Don't forget the new InfoWars app at InfoWars.com slash app.
[03:38:05.851 --> 03:38:08.795]  It's a brand new app for your mobile devices, much improved.
[03:38:09.276 --> 03:38:13.121]  You will never miss another story, another video, another announcement.
[03:38:13.141 --> 03:38:15.084]  And you know why this app is so important, folks?
[03:38:15.144 --> 03:38:16.947]  I mean, I've said the same thing to my own audience.
[03:38:19.062 --> 03:38:22.184]  InfoWars is being systematically censored at every level.
[03:38:22.884 --> 03:38:27.147]  Downranked by Google through a voodoo algorithm black box, okay?
[03:38:27.908 --> 03:38:30.969]  InfoWars is being downranked by YouTube, by Facebook.
[03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:33.191]  The censorship is full force.
[03:38:33.451 --> 03:38:36.213]  But if you get the app, you're bypassing the censorship.
[03:38:36.653 --> 03:38:39.995]  You see, the app is your ticket to freedom of information.
[03:38:40.775 --> 03:38:42.296]  It's your ticket to bypass the censors.
[03:38:42.897 --> 03:38:44.078]  Don't sit around.
[03:38:45.054 --> 03:38:48.838]  And let Google spoon-feed you your news of the day.
[03:38:48.878 --> 03:38:52.602]  For that matter, I mean, don't even let Reddit determine your news of the day.
[03:38:52.622 --> 03:38:53.422]  I mean, nothing against Reddit.
[03:38:53.462 --> 03:38:59.408]  I'm just saying, don't go to Facebook and have a Facebook feed determine what you are reading that day.
[03:38:59.749 --> 03:39:02.411]  Don't let any centralized source of information.
[03:39:03.252 --> 03:39:07.276]  Spoon feed you some twisted, distorted view of reality.
[03:39:07.716 --> 03:39:14.343]  Get the real news, tomorrow's news, today by getting the apps for your favorite publishers.
[03:39:14.603 --> 03:39:17.346]  You know, get the InfoWars app, get the Natural News app if you want.
[03:39:17.886 --> 03:39:18.667]  Get the apps.
[03:39:19.147 --> 03:39:20.729]  Sign up to the InfoWars email list.
[03:39:22.307 --> 03:39:24.688]  Allow InfoWars to directly contact you.
[03:39:24.728 --> 03:39:28.130]  That's the only way to bypass censorship and it matters so much.
[03:39:28.370 --> 03:39:32.593]  It's absolutely crucial that you function in this way because the censorship is full on.
[03:39:32.873 --> 03:39:34.134]  Now, let's go to this...
[03:39:35.404 --> 03:39:51.007]  You heard about this 91-year-old Mexican-American who was beaten, brutally attacked, by a person with a brick, by a woman who allegedly conducted the attack, and yelled, go back to your country.
[03:39:51.327 --> 03:40:00.089]  The Washington Post, demonstrating their fake news yet again, the Washington Post refused to identify the race of the attacker.
[03:40:00.489 --> 03:40:04.630]  Turns out that that woman is an African-American woman
[03:40:05.530 --> 03:40:11.012]  So that this story doesn't fit the narrative that the Washington Post is trying to imply.
[03:40:11.032 --> 03:40:13.272]  The Washington Post is a fake news rag.
[03:40:13.732 --> 03:40:16.013]  They fabricate fake sources.
[03:40:16.613 --> 03:40:19.894]  They are not anything that resembles journalism anymore.
[03:40:19.914 --> 03:40:20.994]  This is another example of it.
[03:40:21.034 --> 03:40:22.395]  So they tried to say...
[03:40:23.493 --> 03:40:34.079]  They tried to imply that this was like some racist Trump supporter who hates immigrants attacking and beating and screaming at a Mexican-American.
[03:40:34.339 --> 03:40:35.459]  That's not at all what happened.
[03:40:35.739 --> 03:40:39.742]  And of course, the Washington Post left that out of the entire thing.
[03:40:40.042 --> 03:40:42.423]  And now also today, there's a video that has come out.
[03:40:42.823 --> 03:40:45.505]  We can't even play the audio, but ICE
[03:40:46.505 --> 03:40:50.567]  ICE employees, ICE agents in Portland, Oregon, are under attack today.
[03:40:51.207 --> 03:40:52.187]  Under vicious attack.
[03:40:52.448 --> 03:40:58.950]  And there's a black ICE agent, an African-American, working for ICE, who is being viciously attacked.
[03:40:59.471 --> 03:41:01.451]  And this story is also on the Gateway Pundit.
[03:41:01.912 --> 03:41:04.673]  And this person is being called an effing N-word.
[03:41:05.908 --> 03:41:07.869]  By the left-wing protesters.
[03:41:08.069 --> 03:41:09.590]  An effing N-word.
[03:41:10.711 --> 03:41:32.382]  This attack against an African-American ICE agent slash employee slash officer, I don't know what terminology you prefer, but the fact that a black man who is working to secure the borders of America, that he is attacked with racial slurs, with profanity and racial slurs by these left-wing extremists,
[03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:37.112]  Who, by the way, Antifa is a domestic terrorism group, right?
[03:41:37.632 --> 03:41:38.632]  That's obvious at this point.
[03:41:38.652 --> 03:41:58.442]  I'm going to talk about Antifa here in a second, but the fact that this black man cannot even have a job defending his own nation's borders without being called the N-word, how insane has the left become now, where to them, if you're black and you wear the uniform of the United States government, you are now an N-word to them.
[03:41:59.362 --> 03:42:00.523]  That is how racist
[03:42:01.728 --> 03:42:04.990]  Remember, these are the people who say that Trump is racist.
[03:42:05.010 --> 03:42:08.232]  These are the people who say that Trump supporters are racist.
[03:42:08.992 --> 03:42:10.814]  In fact, they say everybody's a racist except them.
[03:42:10.914 --> 03:42:14.316]  But they're the ones using the n-word slurs, aren't they?
[03:42:14.796 --> 03:42:19.939]  They're the ones who are hating not on black people, not just on black people, but also they hate white people.
[03:42:20.519 --> 03:42:21.179]  They hate men.
[03:42:21.640 --> 03:42:23.061]  They hate heterosexuals.
[03:42:23.681 --> 03:42:24.782]  They hate Trump supporters.
[03:42:24.842 --> 03:42:25.802]  They hate patriots.
[03:42:26.082 --> 03:42:27.003]  They hate veterans.
[03:42:27.343 --> 03:42:28.224]  They hate cops.
[03:42:28.924 --> 03:42:30.285]  Is there anybody they don't hate?
[03:42:31.314 --> 03:42:32.595]  They hate Kavanaugh!
[03:42:33.195 --> 03:42:46.981]  They hate every decent person who is trying to do their job and protect this country against an invasion that the left wants to see happen in America, and that's why we must stop their efforts, and that's why we need your support.
[03:42:47.401 --> 03:42:49.222]  Stay tuned in here on Infowars.com.
[03:42:49.242 --> 03:42:50.022]  This is Mike Adams.

[03:44:09.380 --> 03:44:10.541]  Thanks for holding.
[03:44:10.641 --> 03:44:11.401]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:44:11.622 --> 03:44:12.002]  Hey, brother.
[03:44:12.022 --> 03:44:12.222]  Sir.
[03:44:12.522 --> 03:44:12.882]  Good, man.
[03:44:12.923 --> 03:44:13.703]  Thank you for calling.
[03:44:13.803 --> 03:44:14.364]  Hey, hey.
[03:44:14.464 --> 03:44:18.867]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:44:19.067 --> 03:44:25.452]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:44:25.592 --> 03:44:27.293]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[03:44:27.374 --> 03:44:34.199]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:44:34.599 --> 03:44:35.800]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:44:35.860 --> 03:44:39.864]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:44:40.264 --> 03:44:41.845]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:44:42.306 --> 03:44:43.046]  And exactly.
[03:44:43.066 --> 03:44:47.290]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:47.931]  Boom!
[03:44:48.091 --> 03:44:50.913]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:44:50.973 --> 03:44:51.514]  It's amazing.
[03:44:51.574 --> 03:44:55.797]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:45:01.277 --> 03:45:09.985]  That President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do, that he's mean as a wolverine.
[03:45:10.726 --> 03:45:11.967]  Wolverines!
[03:45:13.368 --> 03:45:21.896]  So earlier this week I said, hey, let's put out Trump as a wolverine, mean like a wolverine, Infowars.com.
[03:45:22.236 --> 03:45:26.460]  Beautiful new red shirt, incredible job with the graphics crew.
[03:45:26.920 --> 03:45:27.761]  They are amazing.
[03:45:28.661 --> 03:45:30.482]  1995, high quality shirt.
[03:45:30.882 --> 03:45:32.743]  It's being printed right now.
[03:45:32.863 --> 03:45:34.364]  They'll be shipping out next week.
[03:45:34.845 --> 03:45:36.005]  Get your order in.
[03:45:36.065 --> 03:45:37.226]  This is a limited edition.
[03:45:37.306 --> 03:45:39.547]  This needs to be the new viral shirt.
[03:45:40.008 --> 03:45:44.430]  Now, because I saw Walmart boycott launched over in Peach 45 clothing.
[03:45:44.790 --> 03:45:46.351]  Don't boycott Walmart over that.
[03:45:46.531 --> 03:45:47.392]  Just say Walmart.
[03:45:48.432 --> 03:45:49.954]  I don't care if they copy our shirt.
[03:45:50.094 --> 03:45:51.715]  Put out a re-elect 45.
[03:45:52.896 --> 03:45:54.457]  You know, let's engage in that.
[03:45:54.877 --> 03:45:55.978]  So, they've got their Impeach 45.
[03:45:56.018 --> 03:45:58.340]  You go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:58.380 --> 03:46:04.084]  We have re-elect 45 with an American flag very triggering on the right arm and on the back.
[03:46:04.524 --> 03:46:05.665]  Infowars.com.
[03:46:06.386 --> 03:46:08.988]  I am the resistance.
[03:46:10.314 --> 03:46:12.335]  I am the resistance.
[03:46:12.676 --> 03:46:14.497]  These shirts have just been hitting me.
[03:46:14.557 --> 03:46:15.898]  And I knew Hillary for President.
[03:46:15.918 --> 03:46:19.700]  I saw a handmade sign in the yard.
[03:46:21.247 --> 03:46:24.089]  About, you know, like three years before the election.
[03:46:24.109 --> 03:46:25.410]  They knew she'd run.
[03:46:25.470 --> 03:46:28.572]  And then I remember thinking, or two years before, I thought, we've got to do that.
[03:46:28.652 --> 03:46:32.215]  And we went to the RNC, and a third of the people were wearing it.
[03:46:32.235 --> 03:46:33.015]  It was The Chance.
[03:46:34.136 --> 03:46:36.017]  We had planes flying around saying it.
[03:46:36.398 --> 03:46:37.478]  Behind them, it was incredible.
[03:46:37.519 --> 03:46:38.299]  It was a magic moment.
[03:46:39.020 --> 03:46:40.541]  And I know when something's going to be a hit.
[03:46:41.261 --> 03:46:42.262]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:27.699 --> 03:47:36.472]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:39.278 --> 03:47:44.883]  You know, if you missed my CounterThink broadcast from Sunday, you've got to check it out.
[03:47:45.103 --> 03:47:49.047]  I think it's now titled, If the Left Wins, Humanity Dies.
[03:47:49.607 --> 03:47:54.031]  I've got to say, there's a lot of really important information in that broadcast.
[03:47:54.291 --> 03:47:56.333]  And CounterThink airs every 6 p.m.
[03:47:56.393 --> 03:47:59.836]  Central at Infowars.com, by the way, so check it out.
[03:47:59.856 --> 03:48:01.878]  We've got a lot of great episodes coming up.
[03:48:03.124 --> 03:48:10.368]  But for right now, there's some big news this week about Monsanto, which of course has been acquired by Bayer, essentially.
[03:48:11.029 --> 03:48:14.111]  Monsanto is about to get flooded with thousands of cancer lawsuits.
[03:48:14.131 --> 03:48:16.012]  This is a Fox Business article.
[03:48:16.432 --> 03:48:22.896]  And what has happened is that there's a lawsuit in California where a man who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[03:48:23.656 --> 03:48:34.386]  A form of cancer is suing Monsanto because he was exposed to Roundup for many years, and he and his lawyers believe that the Roundup exposure caused his cancer.
[03:48:34.786 --> 03:48:38.329]  And there is significant scientific evidence that supports that case.
[03:48:38.349 --> 03:48:49.420]  But Monsanto has been, I call them sort of the big tobacco of chemical agriculture, and they, you know, until recently when Google now has become the most evil corporation in the world,
[03:48:50.040 --> 03:48:53.244]  Until then, Monsanto was the most evil corporation in the world.
[03:48:53.284 --> 03:48:54.506]  Now it's kind of a tie.
[03:48:54.886 --> 03:48:56.909]  Like, who's more evil, Google or Monsanto?
[03:48:56.969 --> 03:48:57.349]  I don't know.
[03:48:57.650 --> 03:48:59.392]  Monsanto poisons your body and your food.
[03:48:59.712 --> 03:49:02.216]  Google poisons your brain and steals your liberty.
[03:49:02.276 --> 03:49:03.918]  So, I mean, I don't know.
[03:49:04.178 --> 03:49:04.919]  Maybe it's a tie.
[03:49:05.240 --> 03:49:06.661]  They're both incredibly evil.
[03:49:07.202 --> 03:49:18.347]  But Monsanto's getting sued in California and there was a decision in the court that allowed expert testimony now to proceed that would tie exposure to Roundup to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[03:49:18.387 --> 03:49:25.610]  Now if this court case, I mean even now, it's going to open the floodgates to potentially thousands of lawsuits across the country.
[03:49:25.630 --> 03:49:27.631]  This is starting to look a lot like big tobacco.
[03:49:28.740 --> 03:49:33.822]  And it turns out that Monsanto intimidated and threatened scientists, paid off regulators.
[03:49:34.202 --> 03:49:40.204]  Monsanto has been running online smear campaigns for years against any critics of GMOs or glyphosate.
[03:49:40.664 --> 03:49:46.406]  You know, I think they spend a million dollars a year just to target myself and one other person, the food babe.
[03:49:46.786 --> 03:49:53.228]  You know, Monsanto is a very, very evil corporation and it looks like that they are about to get hammered hard.
[03:49:53.728 --> 03:49:57.730]  Thousands of lawsuits could come to the surface and they've been poisoning people
[03:49:58.470 --> 03:49:59.251]  For generations.
[03:49:59.751 --> 03:50:10.317]  This is a company that made Agent Orange, and I think they were involved in DDT, and I know they contaminated the world with PCBs, and they buried the evidence and they hid the science.
[03:50:10.357 --> 03:50:11.238]  So, you know what?
[03:50:11.818 --> 03:50:14.340]  Some of this is coming back on them now, and it could just...
[03:50:15.607 --> 03:50:22.431]  There could be a tidal wave of lawsuits that could make the Monsanto acquisition by Bayer a very, very costly acquisition.
[03:50:23.032 --> 03:50:35.719]  And now, getting back to today's news, when I see Peter Strzok testifying before Congress and saying that he was not in any way biased, it just reminds me of Monsanto.
[03:50:36.179 --> 03:50:38.881]  Of Monsanto saying, no, glyphosate doesn't cause cancer.
[03:50:39.321 --> 03:50:41.222]  No, GMOs, there's nothing wrong with them.
[03:50:41.282 --> 03:50:42.223]  No, the science is great.
[03:50:42.263 --> 03:50:43.724]  No, those rats with all those tumors.
[03:50:44.364 --> 03:50:51.390]  They can barely drag themselves across the table because of the lab science rats that were fed GMOs and Roundup?
[03:50:51.831 --> 03:50:52.431]  No!
[03:50:52.551 --> 03:50:53.332]  Don't look there.
[03:50:53.392 --> 03:50:55.074]  That couldn't be real.
[03:50:55.094 --> 03:50:58.156]  I mean, Monsanto and Peter Strzok.
[03:50:58.237 --> 03:51:01.339]  It's like, Peter Strzok is the Monsanto of the FBI.
[03:51:01.980 --> 03:51:06.324]  He's like, he's in total denial about the evil that he has become.
[03:51:06.344 --> 03:51:07.385]  I mean, this is my opinion.
[03:51:08.493 --> 03:51:10.994]  This is not an official InfoWars opinion, necessarily.
[03:51:11.014 --> 03:51:11.914]  This is just my opinion.
[03:51:11.934 --> 03:51:15.656]  I think Peter Strzok is the Monsanto of the deep state.
[03:51:15.776 --> 03:51:16.796]  Let's put it that way.
[03:51:16.956 --> 03:51:22.919]  And he's just a liar, and he continues to deepen the lie every chance he gets.
[03:51:23.299 --> 03:51:24.239]  And here's a quote from today.
[03:51:24.259 --> 03:51:31.743]  He says, at no time in any of these texts did those personal beliefs ever enter into the realm of any action I took, he said.
[03:51:32.543 --> 03:51:35.064]  I think he was responding to Trey Gowdy.
[03:51:36.584 --> 03:51:47.638]  He says, quote, Strzok says, the suggestion that I'm in some dark chamber somewhere in the FBI and would somehow cast aside all of these procedures, all of these safeguards, and somehow be able to do this is astounding to me.
[03:51:47.959 --> 03:51:50.842]  He says, I simply, it simply couldn't happen.
[03:51:51.243 --> 03:51:51.703]  But wait!
[03:51:53.267 --> 03:52:00.172]  Isn't he also the guy who texted with Lisa Page about having an insurance policy in case Trump won the presidency?
[03:52:00.212 --> 03:52:01.273]  An insurance policy!
[03:52:01.954 --> 03:52:09.759]  And that they were working on that insurance policy, and that his behaviors were clearly biased by any standard of logic and reason.
[03:52:10.060 --> 03:52:12.842]  Remember when Bill Clinton said, you know, he answered a question, it was like,
[03:52:13.542 --> 03:52:16.704]  Well, that depends on what the definition of is, is.
[03:52:17.444 --> 03:52:17.644]  Right?
[03:52:18.224 --> 03:52:20.045]  That's the way Peter Strzok is starting to talk now.
[03:52:20.085 --> 03:52:27.249]  Well, it depends on, you know, it is my belief that I could not possibly have been biased in any of these decisions.
[03:52:27.289 --> 03:52:28.390]  That simply couldn't happen.
[03:52:28.710 --> 03:52:36.254]  I guess Peter Strzok wants us to believe that he has like a multiple personality disorder and that when he's texting Lisa Page,
[03:52:37.054 --> 03:52:40.256]  He's this fiery anti-Trump personality.
[03:52:40.276 --> 03:52:53.345]  I don't know, Peter Strzok A. And then when he goes to work at the FBI, he's Peter Strzok B. The reasonable, rational person who follows all the rules perfectly and loves his country and never does anything wrong.
[03:52:53.985 --> 03:53:04.192]  But then when he goes home and he's texting his mistress and then the evil Peter Strzok A comes out and he's like, we need an insurance plan.
[03:53:04.873 --> 03:53:05.453]  Stop Trump!
[03:53:05.493 --> 03:53:06.153]  We'll stop him!
[03:53:07.114 --> 03:53:09.476]  And who knows what else he texted that hasn't been released, by the way.
[03:53:09.556 --> 03:53:15.620]  Probably texts like, you know, trying to find somebody to execute Trump or something along those lines.
[03:53:15.640 --> 03:53:16.001]  Who knows?
[03:53:16.981 --> 03:53:27.889]  But are we really to believe that this guy has a multiple personality disorder where he doesn't have this hatred in his consciousness when he is applying these decisions and procedures at the FBI?
[03:53:28.330 --> 03:53:30.351]  And by the way, you know what?
[03:53:31.232 --> 03:53:34.174]  Peter Strzok, you're an employee of the American taxpayer.
[03:53:35.382 --> 03:53:47.813]  You better answer the questions, and Trey Gowdy and others, Jim Jordan, many others, are right to put all of you in handcuffs and drag you before the United States Congress and make you answer these questions.
[03:53:48.274 --> 03:53:49.235]  Or you can plead the fifth.
[03:53:49.595 --> 03:53:50.796]  You have that constitutional right.
[03:53:51.797 --> 03:53:52.578]  You can plead the fifth.
[03:53:53.679 --> 03:53:59.103]  But if we could ever wake up Jeff Sessions out of his coma, the DOJ also has the right to charge you
[03:54:00.034 --> 03:54:03.316]  With treason, or sedition, or whatever is the appropriate crime.
[03:54:03.356 --> 03:54:07.820]  Obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, whatever is appropriate.
[03:54:07.840 --> 03:54:15.005]  So, never forget that we are watching and we are waiting for justice, real justice, to be served.
[03:54:15.745 --> 03:54:17.506]  Now, as that is happening, a couple more quick things.
[03:54:18.867 --> 03:54:23.150]  Daily Caller reporting, pressure is building on Democrats to drive off the immigration cliff.
[03:54:23.471 --> 03:54:29.195]  That refers to this new strategy of Democrats, which is to become as radical extremists as you can.
[03:54:30.293 --> 03:54:35.276]  And to say that ICE has to be abolished, no borders, no border control, whatever.
[03:54:35.676 --> 03:54:38.198]  Anybody that shows up, they should all just be invited in.
[03:54:38.358 --> 03:54:39.099]  Come on in!
[03:54:39.419 --> 03:54:55.489]  Have a tidal wave of immigrants, no matter if they're carrying, you know, tuberculosis, or weird retroviral diseases, or they're trafficking in children, or bringing in murderers and rapists, people who are fleeing their own countries because they're wanted by the authorities there.
[03:54:55.509 --> 03:54:58.351]  I guess the left wants all those people in America.
[03:54:59.437 --> 03:55:02.219]  Because they want absolute chaos in society.
[03:55:02.619 --> 03:55:05.321]  The problem is that Middle America doesn't want that.
[03:55:05.601 --> 03:55:06.821]  I mean, the problem for the Democrats.
[03:55:07.702 --> 03:55:10.784]  Middle America wants a peaceful, law-abiding society.
[03:55:11.124 --> 03:55:13.085]  Middle America is opposed to sanctuary cities.
[03:55:13.645 --> 03:55:21.910]  Middle America... I mean, just reasonable, normal people don't want their country overrun with illegals and violent alien criminals.
[03:55:22.831 --> 03:55:27.353]  Normal people don't want sanctuary city policies that protect criminals
[03:55:28.434 --> 03:55:39.746]  And it's coming to the point where you look at the mayors of cities like Portland or Oakland, or you look at, you know, the City Council of Portland seems to be at war with federal immigration policy.
[03:55:39.766 --> 03:55:42.649]  They tried to issue citations against ICE for having a fence.
[03:55:43.410 --> 03:55:44.371]  I mean, it's unreal!
[03:55:45.111 --> 03:55:51.218]  These states and these specific leaders, you know, mayors and city council members and so on,
[03:55:52.846 --> 03:55:55.547]  Are they really going to say that they're on the side of Antifa?
[03:55:56.107 --> 03:55:58.208]  Are they really going to become complicit with terrorists?
[03:55:59.188 --> 03:56:04.850]  Because if that's the direction they're going, then there's going to be a round of, you know, investigations.
[03:56:05.530 --> 03:56:11.872]  I'll just put it that way, and some of these people are going to find themselves, you know, probably behind bars at some point through the legal process.
[03:56:13.412 --> 03:56:14.973]  We've just got a couple minutes left here.
[03:56:14.993 --> 03:56:16.173]  Let me leave you with this.
[03:56:18.447 --> 03:56:25.130]  I've got an upcoming episode of CounterThink called 10 Reasons That We Can Never Let The Left Gain Power Over Us.
[03:56:25.950 --> 03:56:26.890]  I haven't recorded it yet.
[03:56:27.531 --> 03:56:28.471]  I'm going to shortly.
[03:56:28.911 --> 03:56:32.553]  But I've got the list here and I just want to cover a couple of these before I let you go today.
[03:56:32.573 --> 03:56:34.373]  It's very important.
[03:56:34.794 --> 03:56:40.056]  Number 10 on this list is that leftists refuse to coexist in a civil society.
[03:56:40.796 --> 03:56:41.816]  Yeah, there's the whole list right there.
[03:56:41.996 --> 03:56:42.577]  There's my show.
[03:56:43.477 --> 03:56:45.698]  They refuse to coexist in a civil society.
[03:56:47.088 --> 03:56:48.888]  They do not respect the law.
[03:56:49.289 --> 03:56:50.569]  They want lawlessness.
[03:56:50.609 --> 03:56:51.649]  They want chaos.
[03:56:52.649 --> 03:56:57.290]  They will not comply with the outcome of an election unless they win that election.
[03:56:57.710 --> 03:57:00.831]  And they want to try to change the rules, twist the rules, bend the rules.
[03:57:01.111 --> 03:57:02.231]  They want to fight dirty now.
[03:57:02.592 --> 03:57:04.172]  They want to stack the courts now.
[03:57:04.212 --> 03:57:08.393]  They want to boost the Supreme Court to 12 justices so they can do plus three liberals.
[03:57:09.293 --> 03:57:10.314]  They want to change the rules.
[03:57:10.734 --> 03:57:14.416]  They are willing to do anything to gain back power in this country.
[03:57:14.716 --> 03:57:19.078]  They've lost their minds, and we must defeat them at every opportunity.
[03:57:19.519 --> 03:57:22.160]  So continue to tune in to InfoWars.com.
[03:57:22.640 --> 03:57:24.982]  Check out my website from time to time, NaturalNews.com.

[03:57:38.784 --> 03:57:39.945]  We are here fighting for you.
[03:57:40.246 --> 03:57:43.489]  With your support, we can win and take back our country.
[03:57:44.109 --> 03:57:44.930]  Thanks for watching today.
[03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:45.631]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:57:53.541 --> 03:57:55.162]  Well, I've been wanting to get this lady on for a while.
[03:57:55.182 --> 03:57:56.543]  We're going to her in about a minute.
[03:57:57.344 --> 03:57:59.425]  Katie Hopkins over in the UK, but she's in the U.S.
[03:57:59.466 --> 03:57:59.766]  a lot.
[03:58:00.226 --> 03:58:01.127]  Banned off Twitter.
[03:58:02.268 --> 03:58:03.308]  They want her kicked off TV.
[03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:06.811]  Another reason I wanted to get her on is the assassination of Katie Hopkins.
[03:58:07.011 --> 03:58:13.856]  State-sponsored national theater opening in a Welsh area, and it's about killing her, and she's had an attempt on her life.
[03:58:13.957 --> 03:58:15.578]  So, this is next level.
[03:58:15.658 --> 03:58:19.381]  And they want you dead because you're powerful, you're vibrant, and I'm married, but I gotta say,
[03:58:20.221 --> 03:58:21.482]  You are pretty sexy.
[03:58:21.542 --> 03:58:24.525]  Well, if you think I'm sexy, I will say I think you need your eyes tested.
[03:58:24.565 --> 03:58:27.607]  But I do think strong women are really fun to be around.
[03:58:27.647 --> 03:58:30.670]  And the reason my government is sponsoring a play... Well, that's what I'm saying.
[03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:31.710]  Look, I don't think you look bad.
[03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:33.772]  My point is, it's attitudes what matters.
[03:58:34.893 --> 03:58:36.114]  You have light in your eyes.
[03:58:36.314 --> 03:58:37.195]  You have light in your eyes.
[03:58:37.215 --> 03:58:42.422]  I watched all these feminists that were at this feminist meeting with Hillary yesterday, and they look like they're zombies.
[03:58:42.602 --> 03:58:46.107]  It's not that they're even ugly, they look like something sucked their soul.
[03:58:46.307 --> 03:58:54.938]  The reason the state wants to run the play called the assassination of Katie Hopkins is because it would be much more convenient for them if that were true.
[03:58:55.398 --> 03:58:57.441]  One of the things the state loves is fear.
[03:58:57.641 --> 03:58:59.524]  They can control people when they're afraid.
