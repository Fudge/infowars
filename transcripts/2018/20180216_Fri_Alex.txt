[00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.030]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.411]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.192]  Well, they're making their big move to ban guns.
[00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:19.873]  They're saying Trump and all gun owners are mentally ill.
[00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.353]  There's no blame of the psychiatric drugs.
[00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:24.494]  There's no blame of the culture of death.
[00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:29.096]  And the fake news media has been caught lying, saying he traveled the white supremacist compound.
[00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:30.377]  That turns out to be a total hoax.
[00:00:30.757 --> 00:00:37.922]  Let's look at a breakdown of some of the latest news, then we'll come back with the bombshell info as Democrats call for Republicans to be murdered.

[00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:53.671]  Put your
[00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:06.519]  There's been a shooting at a high school in Broward County, Florida, about an hour north of Miami.
[00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.802]  More than 14 students have been injured and the superintendent reports that there are numerous fatalities.
[00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:41.025]  The answer is armed teachers in the schools.
[00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:46.430]  The answer to stop murdering killers is good people with guns.
[00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:50.014]  Did we turn our guns in because Hitler was doing bad things with guns?
[00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:51.856]  No, we used guns to stop him.
[00:01:54.292 --> 00:02:01.396]  He seemed very... I don't know what the word I want to say is, but he was trouble in middle school.
[00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:06.139]  So I kind of joked to him about it and said, I'm surprised you weren't the one who did it.
[00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.080]  And he just gave me a huh.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.422]  So that's really what happened.
[00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:13.363]  You were walking down the hall.
[00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:15.144]  He had already fired at that time.
[00:02:15.624 --> 00:02:16.225]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:16.765]  With him.
[00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:18.426]  Weren't you scared?
[00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:26.305]  Um, in the moment I wasn't because there was obviously, definitely another shooter involved.
[00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:29.792]  Oh, you think he was not the only one?
[00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:30.392]  No.
[00:02:31.172 --> 00:02:31.852]  Definitely not.
[00:02:32.092 --> 00:02:33.693]  Do you think there was more than one shooter?
[00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:36.153]  There's three shooters.
[00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:40.895]  It was impossible for there to have possibly been only one shooter because she heard a shot.
[00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:45.656]  I think this is, uh, there has to be, like, for sure, a second shooter.
[00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:47.677]  I think they need to keep investigating that.
[00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:49.397]  We cannot accept this!
[00:02:50.057 --> 00:02:50.937]  I can't do a wolf.
[00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:51.738]  I'm sorry.
[00:02:51.978 --> 00:02:52.778]  We can't do it.
[00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:59.162]  Cops, with every deadly shooting in this country, the odds get worse and worse and worse.
[00:03:00.422 --> 00:03:02.343]  Are you really willing to keep playing those odds?
[00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.985]  They shouldn't just keep this under the rug as some other...
[00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:12.865]  You know, school shooting where there was a lone gunman and then everyone's up in arms saying, hey, we need gun control.
[00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:14.486]  Everyone needs to take the guns away.
[00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:19.569]  That's why I said I was talking to this guy, you know, near the school.
[00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.493]  And he was telling me these teachers, they would be able to protect the students had they just had the ability to fight back.
[00:03:26.813 --> 00:03:33.317]  He said, when you have a gun and you're going against someone who's trying to shoot you, you're equalizing the balance of power.
[00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:42.621]  That's exactly what needs to happen because you see there's a teacher laying on the floor in one video that I saw with blood everywhere and the teachers are in the center walking out.
[00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:48.964]  This type of stuff could have been completely, maybe not stopped, but diminished.
[00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:50.444]  Quite a bit.
[00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:55.727]  Had a teacher had a gun in that building and they were able to shoot back and kill him.
[00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:59.108]  I thank God to this teacher who opened up her door and let all of us in.
[00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.430]  She got shot in the arm trying to open the door.
[00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.191]  And then the other teacher, he got shot in the head.
[00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:08.853]  He went up and down the hallway just banging and shooting into the classrooms.
[00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:09.814]  He shot through my door.
[00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:12.455]  I think about Grieg and my classroom got hurt.
[00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:13.915]  I just saw blood everywhere.
[00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:19.098]  But I just want to jump into four weeks ago when the Secret Service stuff started happening.
[00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:23.447]  So, uh, it was sort of like a random thing.
[00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:26.430]  I think it happened, like, right after a weekend or something.
[00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.975]  The teachers, every single one of them was instructed to tell us, like, this new drill, like, where our assignments were for each class.
[00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:37.157]  And, uh, you know, every single day they would tell us.
[00:04:37.237 --> 00:04:40.039]  And then I talked to one of my teachers.
[00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.442]  Uh, in fact, it was the same teacher that I ended up being with.
[00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:50.359]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back on the other side with the latest on the Florida situation.
[00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:52.182]  North Korea is really coming to a head.
[00:04:52.202 --> 00:04:59.572]  A lot of science news is the jam-packed vital transmission that the globalists are trying to censor, so please spread all the live links.
[00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.932]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:11.736]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.

[00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:19.285]  Coming to you from the former United States of America from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.586]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.260]  As I'm sure you know and feel, this is another very sad day in America.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.801]  Another senseless shooting.
[00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:34.923]  This time at a high school in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman, a former student, opened fire yesterday.
[00:06:34.983 --> 00:06:37.064]  Again, 17 lives have been lost.
[00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:38.765]  More than a dozen people are hospitalized.
[00:06:39.045 --> 00:06:43.786]  And our president, as he should, weighed in on the tragic events this morning from the White House.
[00:06:44.127 --> 00:06:48.928]  We are all joined together as one American family.
[00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:50.669]  And you're suffering.
[00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:53.670]  Is our burden also.
[00:06:55.051 --> 00:07:01.298]  No child, no teacher should ever be in danger in an American school.
[00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:02.399]  Agreed.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:10.649]  No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning.
[00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:12.121]  Agreed.
[00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:13.862]  So I agree with both of those statements.
[00:07:14.523 --> 00:07:15.964]  And here's what you do to fix that.
[00:07:16.264 --> 00:07:31.633]  Tell your buddies in Congress, tell Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio, all the family men who care so much about their communities, that what we need are laws, real laws, that do everything possible to keep assault rifles out of the hands of people who are going to shoot our kids.
[00:07:31.913 --> 00:07:33.895]  Go on TV and tell them to do that.
[00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.632]  Remember, the left side of the whole Arab Spring.
[00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:44.376]  ...example of the common sense you told us you were going to bring to the White House.
[00:07:44.476 --> 00:07:45.357]  It's time to bring it.
[00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:45.778]  We need it.
[00:07:46.018 --> 00:07:56.668]  Tell these congressmen and lobbyists who infest that swamp you said you were going to drain, force these allegedly Christian men and women who stuff their pockets with money from the NRA... Alright, pause again.
[00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:59.991]  You just got his little anti-Christian statement.
[00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:04.075]  And now the money from the NRA is stuffed in their pockets.
[00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:11.419]  The NRA is one of the only lobbies in the country that actually represents the people and a constitutional right in the Bill of Rights.
[00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:18.382]  And it doesn't come from the Bill of Rights, it's simply pointing it out that because there are bad people in the world is why I have guns.
[00:08:19.162 --> 00:08:26.966]  Just like when your little Islamic buddies you bring in run over dozens and dozens of people, killing them in New York, screaming Allah Akbar, we don't blame
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:37.122]  The truck company that manufactured the automobile that she uses as a weapon, just like when somebody beats somebody over the head with a baseball bat.
[00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:40.824]  We don't then blame Louisville Slugger.
[00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:41.624]  And you know that.
[00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:52.227]  You're on record doing daily consultations five days a week with Chuckie Schumer, who writes your so-called comedy down that is a bunch of political garbage.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.901]  And then he comes out and again calls the President.
[00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:55.662]  It's a long rant.
[00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:57.163]  Mentally ill.
[00:08:57.403 --> 00:09:07.751]  So he's reading off a Democrat Party teleprompter written statement and he's seizing on this tragedy when school shootings are still flat but they're still an issue.
[00:09:07.892 --> 00:09:09.032]  One young person is too many.
[00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:16.738]  And then there's all the warning signs and the FBI called and reports of all the other shooters and all the strangeness going on.
[00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:18.080]  And here's Jimmy Kimmel again.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.819]  In Hollywood that glorifies guns and glorifies violence that's been directly causally linked.
[00:09:26.106 --> 00:09:52.927]  To the rise starting in the 70s of mass shootings because we are way up mass shooting wise compared to the 1950s or 60s But if you look since the 70s, it's a it's a flat curve Overall gun crimes down almost 60% It was over 60% since 1992 but a slight bump the last few years, but not towards its old high In 1988 that was the height of gun violence according to the FBI crime statistics that are very very accurate as they list off local numbers So the heights 88
[00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:55.232]  I don't know.
[00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:24.309]  percent drop since 1992, and you're here just selling total lies, kind of like Don Lemon said yesterday, oh odds are you got a better chance being killed in a mass shooting.
[00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:26.152]  It's just not true.
[00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.751]  But they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:30.472]  They know exactly what they're engaged in.
[00:10:30.832 --> 00:10:32.053]  It's called deception.
[00:10:32.853 --> 00:10:39.497]  And again, remember, it's a fact that when they glorify these mass shooters since the 70s, 80s, and 90s, it continues them.
[00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:43.519]  And there's generally a few more mass shootings in the week after one of these.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.941]  Just like right after Vegas, we saw the church shooting in Texas.
[00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:52.625]  So, everybody should be particularly vigilant right now because there are a lot of mentally ill people out there.
[00:10:54.086 --> 00:10:58.328]  The insert, the Prozac family of drugs, says it can cause mass shootings.
[00:10:58.729 --> 00:11:01.250]  But again, there's never really a public discussion of that, is there?
[00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:13.418]  And now a family and friends have come out that knew the reported shooter, Nick Cruz, and they're saying that he was on psychotropic drugs and basically was a mental zombie.
[00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:14.879]  But that's hardly in the news.
[00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:21.904]  You've got to go to Infowars.com or the local papers or DrugsReport.com has a top-linked right now an article by Paul
[00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:24.885]  Joseph Watson, another article by Don Chalazar.
[00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:26.185]  We're going to break all that down.
[00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:27.126]  Let's continue with Kemmel.
[00:11:27.726 --> 00:11:30.027]  You're to do something now, not later.
[00:11:30.507 --> 00:11:35.449]  Now, and don't you dare let anyone say it's too soon to be talking about it because he said it after Vegas.
[00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:36.989]  He said it after Sandy Hook.
[00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:43.112]  You say that after every one of these eight now fatal school shootings we had in this country this year.
[00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:44.832]  Children are being murdered.
[00:11:46.553 --> 00:11:48.073]  Do something now!
[00:11:48.113 --> 00:11:49.734]  Oh, and now more of the crime.
[00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:55.115]  This is poor good people.
[00:11:56.175 --> 00:12:07.737]  I want to be able to lay more of this out here but again this is Hollywood that glorifies the mass shootings that pushes the gun culture.
[00:12:08.257 --> 00:12:19.359]  This is Kimmel that had a BB gun about a year and a half ago in his studio audience and shot a BB that could put somebody's eye out
[00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:49.809]  Into a jar of pickles into a glass jar of pickles and Here it is The juice of these pickles is on you Alex Jones Now again ladies and gentlemen when he was shooting the jar of pickles He was saying here's a message to you Alex Jones from the New World Order now
[00:12:51.977 --> 00:13:02.004]  They seize on every one of these opportunities, and we need to get back in their face and tell them how dare you sit there and point your finger at American gun owners, at American patriots.
[00:13:02.024 --> 00:13:04.346]  He just had a skit last week making fun of Christians.
[00:13:05.127 --> 00:13:10.571]  He just mixed in again, oh you dirty Christians up there on Capitol Hill, stuff in your pockets.
[00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:14.454]  Imagine if he said something like, you dirty Jews up there.
[00:13:15.154 --> 00:13:17.256]  On Capitol Hill stuffing your pockets.
[00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:20.779]  Are you dirty Muslims up there on Capitol Hill stuffing your pockets?
[00:13:20.819 --> 00:13:25.702]  Are you dirty Buddhists up there on Capitol Hill stuffing your pockets?
[00:13:26.523 --> 00:13:29.745]  But he sits there and says it because Christians are the bad guys.
[00:13:29.826 --> 00:13:31.927]  We're the people being targeted.
[00:13:32.868 --> 00:13:40.334]  Coming up in the next segment, fake news lie about Florida shooter being member of white supremacist group
[00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.695]  Not retracted, even though it's admitted that was all a complete hoax.
[00:13:46.018 --> 00:13:47.741]  Also, the AP's still running with it.
[00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:53.711]  Far-left groups call for murdering Republicans as revenge for Florida shooting.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.563]  Family says Florida shooter, autistic, may have been on medication.
[00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:03.123]  Of course, aren't they always?
[00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:07.406]  Family members claim suspect was on medication to deal with his emotional fragility.
[00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:11.688]  He reportedly introduced himself to thousands of people over the last few years as school shooter.
[00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:18.811]  And said on YouTube he was going to go be a school shooter, but the FBI said that wasn't important enough information.
[00:14:19.512 --> 00:14:22.053]  So that's all coming up.
[00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:35.329]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side, we will get into all of this and a lot more today.

[00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:12.065]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[00:17:12.225 --> 00:17:16.888]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president.
[00:17:17.048 --> 00:17:21.790]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:27.712]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable, fluffy little bunny?
[00:17:27.972 --> 00:17:30.453]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[00:17:30.513 --> 00:17:31.614]  It's actually hilarious.
[00:17:31.694 --> 00:17:33.155]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[00:17:33.195 --> 00:17:34.135]  My wife was cracking up.
[00:17:34.275 --> 00:17:35.436]  And it's a great book for adults.
[00:17:35.456 --> 00:17:36.476]  It's a great book for children.
[00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:37.857]  We're selling the book.

[00:17:47.584 --> 00:17:49.365]  That helps support us.

[00:19:02.447 --> 00:19:02.767]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.394 --> 00:19:05.255]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:05.275 --> 00:19:08.316]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:09.137 --> 00:19:10.237]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:10.557 --> 00:19:12.278]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:12.979 --> 00:19:15.060]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.302]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:19.322 --> 00:19:21.743]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:22.623 --> 00:19:24.945]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:25.305 --> 00:19:26.365]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:26.646 --> 00:19:27.546]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:28.827]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:29.247 --> 00:19:30.288]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:30.328 --> 00:19:31.409]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[00:19:31.429 --> 00:19:32.249]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:32.529 --> 00:19:37.893]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:38.193 --> 00:19:42.475]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:42.696 --> 00:19:45.577]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:45.837 --> 00:19:46.218]  You understand?
[00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:47.579]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:47.959 --> 00:19:49.079]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.965]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:19:55.646 --> 00:19:56.387]  Do you understand?
[00:19:56.407 --> 00:19:57.628]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:59.550]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:20:04.696 --> 00:20:07.339]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.736 --> 00:20:29.441]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:56.912 --> 00:21:02.178]  Alright, I've been really frustrated obviously there's been another mass shooting, more dead young people, makes me sick.
[00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:15.695]  And I've been really upset as well as a lot of you have that we've had a lot of mainstream media, fake news, disinformation seizing on the tragedy to blame the basic rights of all Americans and overturn the fundamental bedrock of our country.
[00:21:17.059 --> 00:21:24.326]  We didn't have mass shootings like this 60, 70 years ago because people were not this immoral.
[00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:31.572]  Now there were cases of different gangsters and groups engaged in massacres and there were examples of federal troops.
[00:21:32.453 --> 00:21:59.407]  uh... killing Native Americans in mass and Native Americans killing towns people and villagers in mass so you've always had massacres and there were big uh... battles out west and Mormons accused of engaging in massacres and other settlers engaged in and accused of massacres of Mormons and I mean there have been plenty of massacres and Pinkerton security men going in and Rockefeller security men going in even in the early nineteen hundreds and
[00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:05.989]  Mowing down whole towns of gold miners and burning their towns to the ground.
[00:22:06.089 --> 00:22:16.913]  And I mean there's so many famous cases of even in the 20s of the US military crushing World War I bonus strikers who camped out around the Capitol building.
[00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:19.574]  So massacres have always happened.
[00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:23.696]  But generally they were state-sponsored or between warring groups.
[00:22:24.216 --> 00:22:26.557]  This modern thing of the copycat
[00:22:28.989 --> 00:22:39.532]  Or the lone nut going out to climb up on top of the UT Tower, that's about where you see the kickoff of that type of stuff in US history in the 1960s.
[00:22:39.612 --> 00:22:48.455]  As I said, this stuff wasn't going on until the late 60s and then accelerated to the 70s, peaking in the 80s, and then now it's been flat.
[00:22:49.055 --> 00:22:50.035]  And that's just the facts.
[00:22:50.855 --> 00:22:52.436]  But still, it doesn't make it okay.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.182]  I've said this, you've said this, you know this.
[00:22:57.742 --> 00:23:05.329]  If someone kills someone with a baseball bat or a knife, and there are as many people killed every year with blunt objects and knives as there are guns.
[00:23:05.389 --> 00:23:11.934]  In fact, many years more people are killed by knives, not just other objects than guns.
[00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:13.936]  Do we say ban knives?
[00:23:14.096 --> 00:23:14.276]  Well...
[00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:20.932]  Actually, in the UK, they've been trying to make you get a license now for butcher knives and cutlery.
[00:23:21.332 --> 00:23:32.922]  It hasn't passed, but they're trying to nationally ban butcher knives and other large knives because they have much higher knife crime in the UK than they would have, quote, gun crime.
[00:23:32.962 --> 00:23:35.604]  That is a crime where guns are used.
[00:23:36.065 --> 00:23:38.567]  So it's the human mind is the problem.
[00:23:38.927 --> 00:23:41.610]  And I know we all know that when we step back.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:59.069]  But when they get Phil Mudd of the CIA slash FBI on TV to cry about another one of God's children has died, or when we get Jimmy Kimmel up there crying, they have been instructed, just like Obama was, to emotionally try to punch our buttons.
[00:23:59.129 --> 00:24:05.593]  And I know, as an audience, you know that, and you're aware of that, and you fully get that.
[00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:23.109]  What I'm getting at here is that a lot of people have gotten comfortable and have believed that they're not going to get our guns when we've been one second to midnight many times and when they've already gotten many of our firearms rights curtailed in different areas of the country.
[00:24:23.769 --> 00:24:33.671]  And it is the global UN policy to completely disarm individuals under the UNIDIR Small Arms Treaty that Obama signed onto but that we have not ratified.
[00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:35.952]  So, this is serious.
[00:24:37.123 --> 00:24:46.170]  And anybody that gets up there and blames gun owners or Christians, like Jimmy Kimmel and others are doing, is a bigoted, lying sack of garbage.
[00:24:47.431 --> 00:24:57.960]  Jimmy Kimmel and the Democratic Party funding the Arab Spring, and funding the Islamic takeover of much of the world, they have blood on their hands on record.
[00:24:59.284 --> 00:25:05.188]  And when they point at us and say that we have blood on our hands, it is asinine.
[00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:07.030]  It is ridiculous.
[00:25:08.991 --> 00:25:17.177]  Hey America, acid attack, why don't you get stabbed, ban guns, nail bomb goes off, so then you'll be safe.
[00:25:18.098 --> 00:25:19.499]  It's hit by a truck like us.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:27.405]  That's right, just ban trucks, ban acid, ban nail bombs, ban knives, that's a little
[00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:34.675]  MOG slash meme that was sent out today on Twitter.
[00:25:35.495 --> 00:25:43.737]  Because if you look at the UK's crime, they have the highest mugging and stabbing rate in the Western world.
[00:25:44.157 --> 00:25:45.238]  Who has the lowest?
[00:25:45.378 --> 00:25:48.598]  Switzerland, where everyone by law has to own a machine gun.
[00:25:48.618 --> 00:25:54.860]  And they've got little armored bunkers scattered all over the country.
[00:25:55.788 --> 00:26:02.651]  Every few square miles full of anti-tank guns, missiles, and high-caliber firearms and hand grenades.
[00:26:03.691 --> 00:26:05.332]  And that's why nobody invades there.
[00:26:05.392 --> 00:26:06.732]  So, now there it is.
[00:26:06.832 --> 00:26:09.053]  UK has one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world.
[00:26:09.373 --> 00:26:11.214]  Police revealed only after Pakistan.
[00:26:11.614 --> 00:26:15.235]  But never will they say it's Islamic connected.
[00:26:15.255 --> 00:26:18.877]  I saw a story I didn't get to yesterday where a
[00:26:20.734 --> 00:26:29.062]  Swedish police chief got suspended because he said, look, let's say it, we have roving gangs of Muslim men that have made us the rape capital of the world.
[00:26:29.102 --> 00:26:31.024]  We had the lowest rape numbers before.
[00:26:31.044 --> 00:26:32.485]  There's such an open, nice society.
[00:26:32.985 --> 00:26:37.369]  And we won't say it's groups of Muslim men up to 100 at a time raping women.
[00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:38.210]  They just grab.
[00:26:39.151 --> 00:26:40.112]  It's insane.
[00:26:40.512 --> 00:26:41.273]  And it's going on.
[00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.254]  It's being covered up.
[00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:46.278]  So the globalists hit us with the scourge of radical Islam.
[00:26:47.987 --> 00:26:55.551]  They bring it in to destabilize things and then they've got the nerve to point their finger at us every, on average, about every six months.
[00:26:55.571 --> 00:27:05.137]  It's only been about, I guess, four months since Vegas and you've got some new big mass shooting and behold, behold, Vegas
[00:27:06.564 --> 00:27:07.204]  Totally fake.
[00:27:07.684 --> 00:27:08.565]  Do we know exactly what happened?
[00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:13.607]  No, but we know he went to the Middle East, he was an arms dealer, he had other people in the room.
[00:27:14.327 --> 00:27:20.409]  InfoWars broke all of this from FBI sources the day after, and then other sources confirmed it.
[00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:28.132]  Of course we should now look at this new event and say, okay, if he did act alone, he told everybody, I'm the school shooter.
[00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:31.674]  He wasn't allowed to bring a backpack to school before he was expelled last year.
[00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:41.268]  And then all these witnesses say multiple shooters, they're talking to him while the shots are going off, and this is totally ignored!
[00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:50.311]  I'm fighting to get any of these young people on, but let me give the number out specifically for people that attend to that high school in Florida.
[00:27:52.672 --> 00:28:00.615]  Only for you to call in if you're a witness or have family there, or one of the young ladies that we see interviewed by local news.
[00:28:02.062 --> 00:28:05.624]  And by Texas News that then never aired it but put it out on Twitter.
[00:28:06.444 --> 00:28:12.968]  Never aired on the TV stations but put it out on their Twitter accounts because the reporters thought you might need to actually see what they were really being told.
[00:28:13.068 --> 00:28:17.210]  And then we interviewed a student yesterday and he said, oh yeah, that's what other people were telling him.
[00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.071]  It's not like it's one random person saying this.
[00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:21.072]  It's a whole bunch.
[00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:25.778]  It's not like they're getting confused by hearing different echoes and things.
[00:28:25.818 --> 00:28:27.762]  This is happening all over.
[00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:32.471]  And this is with people that are walking with the person they were told was a supposed shooter, Nicholas.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.642]  Nicholas Cruz.
[00:28:36.282 --> 00:28:37.703]  We'll be back on the other side.
[00:28:37.743 --> 00:28:38.724]  Toll-free number 4.
[00:28:39.264 --> 00:28:41.466]  Folks right there in Florida that are witnesses or family.
[00:28:41.907 --> 00:28:46.090]  Survivors, 877-789-ALEX.
[00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.111]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:28:47.171 --> 00:28:49.412]  Please leave the lines open, listeners.
[00:28:50.113 --> 00:28:52.515]  At least until the next hour for only those folks to call.
[00:28:52.535 --> 00:28:52.935]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:28:52.955 --> 00:28:53.356]  We'll be back.
[00:28:53.396 --> 00:28:53.816]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.578 --> 00:29:08.262]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:29:09.142 --> 00:29:13.184]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:29:13.704 --> 00:29:16.045]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:19.947]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:33.594]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:29:34.295 --> 00:29:49.363]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[00:29:50.343 --> 00:29:54.046]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWarsTore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:56.327]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:58.749]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[00:29:59.109 --> 00:30:03.773]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:30:04.173 --> 00:30:15.221]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[00:30:15.721 --> 00:30:16.642]  This is Pollen Block.
[00:30:17.618 --> 00:30:29.887]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[00:30:30.348 --> 00:30:34.211]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[00:30:34.671 --> 00:30:38.713]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[00:30:39.173 --> 00:30:48.819]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:52.160]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.
[00:30:52.461 --> 00:30:56.703]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:31:05.103 --> 00:31:08.205]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:31:08.245 --> 00:31:08.765]  You're on the air.
[00:31:08.785 --> 00:31:09.926]  Thanks for holding.
[00:31:09.946 --> 00:31:10.786]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:31:10.986 --> 00:31:11.607]  Hey, brother.
[00:31:11.927 --> 00:31:12.267]  Good, man.
[00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.107]  Thank you for calling.
[00:31:13.187 --> 00:31:13.748]  Hey, hey.
[00:31:13.848 --> 00:31:18.250]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:24.774]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:31:24.834 --> 00:31:26.675]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:31:26.755 --> 00:31:32.478]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:35.180]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.681]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[00:31:37.741 --> 00:31:39.242]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:31:39.642 --> 00:31:41.303]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:31:41.683 --> 00:31:42.423]  And exactly.
[00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:46.685]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:31:47.046 --> 00:31:47.326]  Boom!
[00:31:47.466 --> 00:31:50.287]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:31:50.347 --> 00:31:50.867]  It's amazing.
[00:31:50.927 --> 00:31:52.228]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[00:31:52.288 --> 00:31:55.170]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.961]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:32:02.241 --> 00:32:03.522]  You can't survive without it.
[00:32:03.722 --> 00:32:04.623]  But where do you get it?
[00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:10.688]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:32:10.908 --> 00:32:16.632]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:32:16.832 --> 00:32:33.679]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[00:33:04.128 --> 00:33:08.630]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.617 --> 00:33:30.140]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:42.486 --> 00:33:44.828]  Phil Mudd, you're hearing these accounts.
[00:33:44.888 --> 00:33:50.255]  What's going through your mind as someone who used to work at the FBI?
[00:33:50.275 --> 00:33:51.536]  You think it's antiseptic.
[00:33:52.077 --> 00:33:52.538]  It's not.
[00:33:55.675 --> 00:34:01.398]  I talked to a terrorist who almost died because he wanted to blow up a weapon, a car bomb.
[00:34:01.758 --> 00:34:02.899]  Button cam 3.
[00:34:03.139 --> 00:34:10.924]  The car caught fire, it didn't blow up, and I talked to him after he lost a lot of his skins, his hands, his feet.
[00:34:12.024 --> 00:34:17.287]  I have 10 nieces and nephews, we're talking about bump stocks, we're talking about legislation.
[00:34:17.307 --> 00:34:18.708]  Fade up music.
[00:34:22.023 --> 00:34:23.924]  A child of God is dead.
[00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:33.010]  Cannot we acknowledge in this country that we can't, we cannot accept this.
[00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.051]  I can't do a whoop.
[00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:34.892]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:34.912 --> 00:34:35.972]  I can't do it.
[00:34:36.453 --> 00:34:36.973]  Oops.
[00:34:38.154 --> 00:34:43.337]  All right, we're gonna get back to you, but you're obviously, this is so emotional.
[00:34:43.457 --> 00:34:49.041]  Unfortunately, it happens all too often, and as a result, people say we've got to learn some lessons.
[00:34:51.224 --> 00:34:56.548]  And the Oscar goes to... Phil Mudd.
[00:35:03.172 --> 00:35:18.562]  Phil Mudd, Obama, all of them, Jimmy Kimmel with their fake crying while they help fund the radical jihad Arab Spring that killed close to a million people, enslaved hundreds of thousands of women and children, sold into sex slavery, and now that slavery's been re-established in North Africa and areas of the Middle East,
[00:35:19.736 --> 00:35:21.937]  CNN has reports about it, but never says it's Islamic.
[00:35:23.178 --> 00:35:24.659]  So, just remember that.
[00:35:24.719 --> 00:35:35.466]  Now, we're leaving the phones open for at least a couple more segments for anybody from the high school or friends or family to call in and give your testimony, but we had one of the survivors on yesterday.
[00:35:36.046 --> 00:35:46.353]  We played multiple clips that never made the local news, but that were put on Twitter of local stations interviewing people, reporting on
[00:35:48.652 --> 00:35:49.994]  Multiple shooters.
[00:35:50.755 --> 00:35:59.325]  And in seeing the supposed shooter, Nicholas Cruz, while other shots were going off, and in appearing that he wasn't involved, he didn't have a firearm.
[00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:02.589]  I mean, that has got to be looked at, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:04.071 --> 00:36:08.096]  That has really got to be looked at in a big, big way.
[00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:23.738]  And I'm impressed that listeners are not calling in right now and just leaving the phone lines open for anybody there at that high school or anybody that had friends or family at the high school or anybody that has specific first-hand information to call in.
[00:36:23.778 --> 00:36:30.643]  The number is 877-789-ALEX and we'll leave that open for this segment, the next, then open the phones up to everybody in general.
[00:36:30.663 --> 00:36:31.804]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:36:32.904 --> 00:36:35.626]  Quentin Tarantino's father was scheduled to be on
[00:36:36.887 --> 00:36:59.424]  Today and I'm seeing if I can move him to the third hour because there's just so much news breaking on this front He contacted me and we looked it up that it is his father and has his own production company This is where Quentin began to get into it himself, but they they're estranged and he wanted to respond his son's statements on Howard Stern saying that Roman Polanski having
[00:37:00.657 --> 00:37:01.117]  I don't know.
[00:37:21.244 --> 00:37:31.051]  And about some of these issues and why Quentin thinks that's normal for children to have sex with adults is, to say the least, very, very horrifying.
[00:37:32.232 --> 00:37:34.193]  So Tarantino Productions is his site.
[00:37:34.914 --> 00:37:39.377]  And he's been in film productions before Quentin was born.
[00:37:39.997 --> 00:37:46.181]  And we need to look into the mind of one of the main confidants of Harvey Weinstein.
[00:37:47.501 --> 00:37:50.222]  Understand how Quentin Tarantino got so twisted.
[00:37:51.062 --> 00:37:52.363]  So that is going to be coming up now.
[00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:53.543]  He's agreed to move to the third hour.
[00:37:53.563 --> 00:37:55.024]  Alex Newman of the New American Magazine.
[00:37:55.484 --> 00:37:56.845]  We're going to move him to another day.
[00:37:57.385 --> 00:38:01.967]  Obviously, as all this unfolds, I'll be back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:38:02.027 --> 00:38:05.068]  Central Standard Time with the Sunday transmission.
[00:38:05.348 --> 00:38:08.169]  And we will have open phones next hour as well.
[00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:09.110]  Okay.
[00:38:12.486 --> 00:38:21.613]  I got news a couple weeks ago, and then I got it again last week, and I got it again Monday, from high-level sources.
[00:38:21.693 --> 00:38:39.446]  And when I say high-level sources, when you get information from this high level, and you're gonna announce stuff like this on here, I meant to cover it a few days ago, and I just couldn't bring myself
[00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:56.379]  to even discuss it or even talk about it because it's so fraught with issues and it's so concerning and it's so real that one does not feel like they're worthy to cover it.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.123]  But it's like a surgeon, even the best surgeons, a lot of times
[00:39:02.898 --> 00:39:06.222]  Don't want to do a surgery because they don't think they can fix the problem.
[00:39:06.662 --> 00:39:08.564]  I was told that by a top surgeon yesterday.
[00:39:08.584 --> 00:39:11.427]  I waited years to get my Achilles that was ruptured fixed.
[00:39:11.968 --> 00:39:16.713]  It just grew back as they do when they're ruptured on its own, deformed and weakened.
[00:39:16.753 --> 00:39:18.835]  And he just said, I don't think I can.
[00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:21.819]  I don't think I can make it better because you didn't get it fixed up front.
[00:39:23.902 --> 00:39:30.244]  And so here he is, board certified, one of the top guys in the state, and he was honest.
[00:39:30.484 --> 00:39:32.025]  He said, you can probably get somebody else to do it.
[00:39:32.685 --> 00:39:42.408]  He says, if you really want me to, I can get in there and cut it, shorten it, and do some other stuff, but it's already stretched out, and it healed, but it healed deformed.
[00:39:43.949 --> 00:39:48.150]  And that's what kind of wobbles around, my leg does.
[00:39:49.441 --> 00:39:57.044]  The pimp walk is not intentional and it's kind of like the surgeon just doesn't want to do the surgery because he just doesn't think he can probably fix it right.
[00:39:57.825 --> 00:40:01.186]  And I respect that because a lot of doctors will do it regardless.
[00:40:01.206 --> 00:40:02.366]  He's got to be signed the waiver forms.
[00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:03.867]  That's why I try to go to the best.
[00:40:04.687 --> 00:40:11.790]  And it's kind of the same allegory or the same parallel as to what I'm about to cover when we come back after this break.
[00:40:22.068 --> 00:40:23.729]  And it's not that I'm at loss for words.
[00:40:25.611 --> 00:40:33.638]  I have asked through a couple phone calls to different sources why I'm being given this information.
[00:40:35.439 --> 00:40:41.804]  And some of these sources have given us info before that's been very, very accurate.
[00:40:43.186 --> 00:40:47.890]  And another one of the sources is a very, very credible source and was meeting with the deputy director
[00:40:49.130 --> 00:41:02.336]  of a major intelligence agency recently, and was told this information, and I gather, they won't be specific, but yes, they want me to know it, and want me to tell you this.
[00:41:03.537 --> 00:41:06.498]  And the media probably won't even pick this up because it's so hardcore, that's fine.
[00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:11.721]  I just can't even get answers to this, and they don't really have answers.
[00:41:12.741 --> 00:41:15.963]  And so I will attempt as best I can when we come back to get into this.
[00:41:18.331 --> 00:41:28.438]  It deals with North Korea, obviously, and a date, a week, period, that they have picked up chatter that North Korea is planning a strike.
[00:41:29.198 --> 00:41:32.581]  And the fact that North Korea would be putting this type of chatter out, well, they put it out publicly.
[00:41:33.121 --> 00:41:35.443]  And that's what makes me get a headache when I think about it.
[00:41:35.463 --> 00:41:47.951]  In fact, you guys pulled me the stack of North Korean news from yesterday that I almost covered at the end of the day before, because I want to... I sit here and I say this for hours, and I just want to try to figure out the best way to talk about it.
[00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:53.269]  Because this is the number one issue right now.
[00:41:54.069 --> 00:42:05.833]  And while we're busy looking at the tragic school shooting and all the rest of it, that's one drop in the bucket compared to what Islamists are killing right now, or what GMO is killing right now, or what Roundup is killing right now, or what any of these big issues are.
[00:42:05.853 --> 00:42:08.394]  So we're going to go to break and come back and cover this.
[00:42:08.454 --> 00:42:12.736]  But bottom line, everybody needs to be praying to God for justice and for awakening and for peace.
[00:42:14.197 --> 00:42:17.178]  But this is a very, very serious time to be alive.

[00:45:00.188 --> 00:45:11.717]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[00:45:11.757 --> 00:45:12.718]  We're exposed to lead.
[00:45:12.758 --> 00:45:13.779]  We're exposed to mercury.
[00:45:13.819 --> 00:45:18.803]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:24.207]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[00:45:24.307 --> 00:45:26.429]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[00:45:27.209 --> 00:45:28.590]  Well, causes you to gain weight.
[00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:32.351]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[00:45:32.451 --> 00:45:37.433]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[00:45:37.813 --> 00:45:43.276]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:45:43.656 --> 00:45:48.878]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[00:45:49.238 --> 00:45:50.178]  And over and over again.
[00:45:50.258 --> 00:45:57.140]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.561]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[00:45:59.661 --> 00:46:01.222]  I mean, this is so massive.
[00:46:01.302 --> 00:46:14.706]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland in men.
[00:46:14.726 --> 00:46:15.286]  Fertility is key.
[00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:32.394]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[00:46:32.774 --> 00:46:36.796]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:40.378]  And you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill, and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying.
[00:46:40.878 --> 00:46:42.239]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:46.902]  I started losing weight, all this energy, I guess the iodine was sucking garbage out.
[00:46:47.243 --> 00:46:52.747]  It's as important as vitamin C. You gotta have vitamin C, you gotta have iodine to live, you gotta have water to live.

[00:47:04.157 --> 00:47:06.779]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.112 --> 00:47:22.153]  You want answers?
[00:47:22.733 --> 00:47:23.754]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:24.514 --> 00:47:29.117]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:29.177 --> 00:47:30.518]  You won't hear me.
[00:47:30.638 --> 00:47:31.258]  Okay.
[00:47:46.252 --> 00:47:47.093]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:47:47.133 --> 00:47:54.537]  We have been in a state of war since 1950 with the dictatorship of North Korea.
[00:47:54.657 --> 00:48:01.221]  We are now facing the third hereditary leader of the Hermit Kingdom, as it is called.
[00:48:01.902 --> 00:48:13.149]  The most backwards, nightmarish, corrupt, starving, authoritarian, patriarchal, communist nightmare.
[00:48:14.056 --> 00:48:22.643]  But the left thinks it's so cute and funny and that NBC and CBS and CNN and MSNBC have been defending and promoting.
[00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:24.124]  Now I want to be clear.
[00:48:24.605 --> 00:48:26.966]  I don't want to have a war with the North Korean people.
[00:48:27.907 --> 00:48:28.608]  I want to be clear.
[00:48:29.088 --> 00:48:31.730]  I understand that they are casualties of this evil.
[00:48:32.431 --> 00:48:35.173]  Culturally, spiritually, physically, mentally.
[00:48:36.334 --> 00:48:43.560]  That said, they're being used as a detonator by the communist Chinese and others to project power and destabilization into the South China Sea.
[00:48:47.748 --> 00:49:02.865]  And now North Korea has been threatening for a long, long time to attack Japan, to attack South Korea, to attack the United States.
[00:49:04.406 --> 00:49:05.528]  The list goes on and on.
[00:49:15.177 --> 00:49:25.580]  Now they have atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, thanks to the Clintons, the Communist Chinese and others that gave them the reactors, the technology, the missile secrets, the rocket secrets, the engines.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:31.161]  Now they've finally gotten better engines out of Ukraine, from our allies, not the Russians.
[00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:36.223]  And so things have deteriorated and they've been kicking the can down the road, as the President said, it's at the end of the road.
[00:49:37.063 --> 00:49:41.225]  And North Korea is now saying, we will preemptively strike you, we will kill you, we will destroy you.
[00:49:41.646 --> 00:49:51.291]  But when someone points a gun at you and says, we will attack you, we will destroy you, we will kill you, you have a right, when somebody's pointing a gun at you, to pull your gun and take them out.
[00:49:51.811 --> 00:49:52.792]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:49:52.812 --> 00:49:55.073]  I don't want to bring the communist Chinese in, or the Russians.
[00:49:55.634 --> 00:49:56.874]  This is how you could end the world.
[00:49:58.035 --> 00:50:05.059]  But if North Korea attacks Seoul, or North Korea attacks Japan, those are our allies, and civilization starts ending real quick.
[00:50:07.298 --> 00:50:08.599]  Because we'll be drawn into those wars.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:13.903]  And that's how conventional war, they believe, within hours will lead into a full-out war.
[00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:27.194]  Now, that said, I have talked to the personnel and the individuals at the highest levels
[00:50:28.976 --> 00:50:30.257]  Highest levels below the president.
[00:50:30.877 --> 00:50:37.561]  And then at the levels where people would actually be attempting to go in on suicide missions to kill Kim Jong-un.
[00:50:38.621 --> 00:50:41.623]  And so a lot of what I'm saying is publicly available information.
[00:50:42.283 --> 00:50:51.408]  But I have repeatedly been told by different sources this and then asked why I'm not talking about it on air because they know the military and the general public that's thinking is listening.
[00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:55.010]  And so the highest levels of multiple U.S.
[00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.572]  intelligence agencies want you to know this.
[00:51:00.254 --> 00:51:22.190]  North Korean chatter and preparations both from human intelligence and signals states that North Korea is at this time planning a preemptive strike against Japan, Tokyo with ICBMs starting in the last two days of March going into April 2nd.
[00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:23.511]  So anywhere
[00:51:25.134 --> 00:51:26.755]  Within that four or five day period.
[00:51:27.196 --> 00:51:36.902]  And that everyone, especially families of armed service members, should not be traveling and should not be leaving the United States during that period.
[00:51:37.342 --> 00:51:45.428]  And because they don't want to officially put that announcement out, they want that announcement put out to this audience because you are seen as the most awake, patriotic Americans.
[00:51:46.869 --> 00:51:47.910]  End of that message.
[00:51:49.271 --> 00:51:49.891]  Continuing.
[00:51:53.052 --> 00:52:08.445]  As other sources have pointed out, the SpaceX launch of a month ago, not the recent one, the most recent, was carrying some type of high-tech electromagnetic pulse warhead or warheads that could take out North Korea preemptively.
[00:52:09.165 --> 00:52:10.567]  And Trump has said that's on the table.
[00:52:10.587 --> 00:52:14.450]  There's a lot of other secretive weapons in the whole fire and fury arsenal.
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:20.965]  But that North Korean chatter is not also just that they're planning a preemptive strike.
[00:52:20.985 --> 00:52:25.149]  What you hear them saying, we'll attack you any day, we will destroy you, the whole U.S.
[00:52:25.189 --> 00:52:28.392]  will be fire soon, we're gonna hit you, that's a promise.
[00:52:28.492 --> 00:52:31.515]  I mean, I've got the stacks of articles, you've all heard it, seen it out of their official.
[00:52:32.717 --> 00:52:36.981]  But when it's internally going on, and they're saying that over the radio to their military,
[00:52:37.881 --> 00:52:39.642]  Maybe their country's about to collapse.
[00:52:39.662 --> 00:52:44.586]  A lot of evidence shows they want to make the military think they're in such a crisis they stay at their post because the food's running out or whatever.
[00:52:44.826 --> 00:52:45.246]  I don't know.
[00:52:45.946 --> 00:52:49.529]  And no one really does outside of Kim Jong-un's insane brain.
[00:52:49.869 --> 00:52:53.111]  But they're telling him that we are preparing the strike.
[00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:56.614]  We are preparing the first strike.
[00:52:57.114 --> 00:52:57.855]  We are preparing.
[00:52:57.915 --> 00:52:58.415]  Be ready.
[00:52:58.595 --> 00:53:02.358]  By March 28th we will launch the attack by April 2nd.
[00:53:04.491 --> 00:53:12.695]  So North Korea is saying that they're going to attack in the last few days of March into the first few days of April.
[00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:21.099]  And then North Korea is publicly saying, warning Trump, very close for him to strike, decision of a World War III threat.
[00:53:21.139 --> 00:53:23.300]  So both sides are saying this back and forth.
[00:53:24.209 --> 00:53:25.070]  And then here's the other part.
[00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:29.112]  You've all heard about EMPs, and North Korea's threatened to hit the U.S.
[00:53:29.152 --> 00:53:31.994]  with an EMP, and I think some of that threat's overplayed.
[00:53:32.054 --> 00:53:40.759]  Once they hit, like, Los Angeles, that would cause a chain reaction of power plants going out that could knock out large parts of the country and could take months or years to get them back on, because it's already so tenuous.
[00:53:41.279 --> 00:53:45.081]  You see what happens with a few ice storms that only knock down a fraction of the power lines.
[00:53:45.141 --> 00:53:46.882]  It causes sometimes months of outages in areas.
[00:53:51.391 --> 00:54:11.970]  The highest levels of the Pentagon, the highest levels of the CIA, they are telling people who've been in for decades and never heard anything like this, that North Korea is launching an attack by the end of March, early April, and that we have to then be ready to defend against it and that we may strike them first.
[00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:17.274]  And again, I don't want to get on air as a family man or just as a human, period, and say things like this.
[00:54:18.701 --> 00:54:20.002]  That in any way escalate things.
[00:54:20.182 --> 00:54:33.572]  But Kim Jong-un's already doing it and everything they're saying in the news is what I'm getting from behind the scenes and that they just hope this is some weird bluster internally to their forces.
[00:54:33.652 --> 00:54:38.576]  But they've told their population, roughly 20% of it's the military,
[00:54:39.599 --> 00:54:58.105]  One of the largest standing armies in the world, though it's somewhat Stone Age, most of them are on foot, but they do have ICBMs, they do have chemical weapons, they do have tens of thousands of large artillery, and they can destroy South Korea very quickly, and especially the capital, Seoul, they can attack Japan.
[00:54:58.225 --> 00:55:04.247]  But I mean, they are reportedly sending out communications that they are intending a first strike.
[00:55:05.276 --> 00:55:13.522]  And I have asked, that's why I waited about a week or more, so I'm getting these in-person meetings and phone calls and other messages.
[00:55:17.706 --> 00:55:20.107]  Why am I being asked to say this to the public?
[00:55:21.288 --> 00:55:26.132]  And it's just, we just want your audience to know.
[00:55:27.013 --> 00:55:32.437]  So you sit there and you gauge that however you want, but that's real information.
[00:55:33.298 --> 00:55:34.599]  Whatever's meant by it,
[00:55:35.578 --> 00:55:37.519]  Gives me a headache even trying to figure it out.
[00:55:38.299 --> 00:55:40.320]  And I don't think the people giving me the info, they don't know either.
[00:55:40.881 --> 00:55:56.308]  But some of these sources are the type of sources that say, I just talked to the hostage rescue team there, and this is what happened, and this is what's unfolding, and he went to the mental aid station, he's a gun dealer, and the Saudis were in town, and blah blah, and then later it all comes out.
[00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:03.532]  And then I get a call from the hostage rescue team source saying, go ahead and go with it.
[00:56:05.034 --> 00:56:08.535]  And the media makes jokes about it, even though you can go back and see that turned out to be accurate.
[00:56:08.915 --> 00:56:13.476]  So, this isn't from the FBI hostage rescue team, this is from way up above that.
[00:56:14.357 --> 00:56:18.598]  In the meeting rooms, with the satellites and all the people and everything.
[00:56:20.178 --> 00:56:26.220]  And then, it's just relayed, and people say, what am I supposed to do with that?
[00:56:29.226 --> 00:56:30.026]  Tell certain people.
[00:56:30.907 --> 00:56:31.447]  Tell them this.
[00:56:32.408 --> 00:56:33.368]  And people don't ask why.
[00:56:33.388 --> 00:56:34.789]  They say, yes, sir.
[00:56:35.369 --> 00:56:36.790]  And then I'm given the information.
[00:56:38.731 --> 00:56:42.572]  So, quite a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:42.592 --> 00:56:46.094]  We should be praying for peace here, but this is just crazy.
[00:56:46.154 --> 00:56:48.955]  And the absence of war doesn't mean war doesn't exist.
[00:56:49.015 --> 00:56:50.856]  The absence of nuclear war doesn't mean it exists.
[00:56:51.076 --> 00:56:56.259]  The longer we push it back, statistically, the better a chance it'll finally happen until they're eradicated.
[00:56:58.459 --> 00:57:01.380]  And I'm not even saying eradicate it, because they want the UN to be the only ones that have the nukes.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.640]  I mean, it is just a serious situation.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.881]  North Korea threatens electromagnetic pulse attack.
[00:57:06.381 --> 00:57:07.661]  Questions over lapses in U.S.
[00:57:07.681 --> 00:57:09.861]  grid security rise.
[00:57:09.901 --> 00:57:10.442]  Fox News.
[00:57:10.742 --> 00:57:15.543]  North Korea plotting to wipe out 90% of USA with deadly EMP bomb amid World War III scare.
[00:57:15.623 --> 00:57:15.983]  Express.
[00:57:16.003 --> 00:57:16.883]  That's them saying it.
[00:57:17.543 --> 00:57:21.524]  And the Pentagon says they believe they have a weapon and are targeting Los Angeles.
[00:57:22.364 --> 00:57:28.870]  They'll knock everything out for 500 square miles and cause a chain reaction that could knock out half the country.
[00:57:31.972 --> 00:57:33.414]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:57:33.514 --> 00:57:34.234]  Bloody nose.
[00:57:34.595 --> 00:57:37.917]  Strike on North Korea could begin with cyber attack by the U.S.
[00:57:37.937 --> 00:57:38.938]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[00:57:38.978 --> 00:57:41.060]  Mikel Phelan, InfoWars.com.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.121]  But this is not a drill.
[00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:47.305]  And what you got is real sources, real, real information from the highest levels.
[00:57:47.325 --> 00:57:47.766]  We'll be back.

[00:59:54.617 --> 00:59:58.559]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.561]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:41.452]  So that's how he intends to hopefully get somebody to make something up against Trump.
[01:00:41.492 --> 01:00:42.292]  We knew that was coming.
[01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.953]  Let's get Roger Stone in here ASAP.
[01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:47.334]  He's here at the office right now, former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:00:47.754 --> 01:00:49.455]  So we got a rare drudge siren going.
[01:00:49.495 --> 01:00:53.116]  Let's go to this report though, because he lays it all out with the Second Amendment.
[01:00:53.536 --> 01:01:00.039]  Tucker, psychiatric drugs, social alienation, broken families, war on men more relevant than gun control, and he's dead on.
[01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:00.459]  Here it is.
[01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:05.040]  Every decent person is horrified by what happened yesterday in Parkland.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.523]  Every thoughtful person knows something horrible is going on in American society.
[01:01:10.164 --> 01:01:13.927]  Tragedies like this happen for a reason, and it probably doesn't have a lot to do with guns.
[01:01:14.507 --> 01:01:19.851]  The percentage of American households with firearms has dropped dramatically over the past 35 years.
[01:01:20.492 --> 01:01:22.634]  Meanwhile, the number of mass shootings has risen.
[01:01:23.014 --> 01:01:25.776]  If you're over 40, you did not grow up in a country like this.
[01:01:25.796 --> 01:01:27.678]  So the question is, what happened?
[01:01:28.278 --> 01:01:29.199]  It could be a lot of things.
[01:01:29.879 --> 01:01:32.980]  Far more Americans than ever before take psychiatric medications.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.741]  Are outbursts of violence a potential side effect?
[01:01:36.141 --> 01:01:37.421]  We don't know, but it's possible.
[01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:41.482]  Does the social atomization of modern society play a role in all this?
[01:01:42.103 --> 01:01:45.143]  Well, spending life online does cause alienation.
[01:01:45.183 --> 01:01:45.744]  We know that.
[01:01:46.044 --> 01:01:50.965]  Last week we interviewed author Johan Hari, who has studied the dramatic rise of depression in this country.
[01:01:51.525 --> 01:01:57.407]  As he pointed out, the most common answer to the question, how many close friends do you have, is now zero.
[01:01:58.127 --> 01:02:01.369]  A lack of meaningful relationships does cause despair.
[01:02:01.649 --> 01:02:04.170]  Perhaps in rare cases, it drives some to mass murder.
[01:02:05.191 --> 01:02:07.812]  Meanwhile, the nuclear family has collapsed nationwide.
[01:02:08.092 --> 01:02:11.974]  Does a generation of boys growing up without fathers pose a threat to this country?
[01:02:12.455 --> 01:02:13.135]  Of course it does.
[01:02:13.215 --> 01:02:13.835]  Why wouldn't it?
[01:02:14.436 --> 01:02:17.437]  Fatherlessness is one feature common to many mass shooters.
[01:02:17.477 --> 01:02:18.558]  Nobody's surprised by that.
[01:02:19.538 --> 01:02:21.199]  And what about men more broadly?
[01:02:21.659 --> 01:02:24.581]  As a group, men are not thriving in this country right now.
[01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:27.862]  Ignore the propaganda, there's a lot of it, and instead look at the numbers.
[01:02:28.363 --> 01:02:33.485]  Men kill themselves more, graduate less, and of course commit pretty much 100% of mass shootings.
[01:02:33.965 --> 01:02:37.567]  It's a disaster, which for some reason our elites persist in ignoring.
[01:02:38.367 --> 01:02:42.650]  In March, this show will begin a month-long series every Wednesday on what is happening to men.
[01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:43.970]  We hope it'll be interesting.
[01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:47.032]  But why haven't we been talking about this for years?
[01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:52.034]  We're not saying any of these factors caused the massacre we saw yesterday.
[01:02:52.054 --> 01:02:52.815]  We don't know that.
[01:02:53.455 --> 01:02:58.159]  We are saying we ought to do our honest best as a nation to figure out what exactly is going on here.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.761]  But we're not doing that.
[01:03:00.141 --> 01:03:13.092]  That vital conversation has been drowned out and made impossible by mindless screeching about gun control, led by blustery charlatans in the media, you know exactly who they are, and also in Congress, whose only real agenda is moral preening.
[01:03:13.792 --> 01:03:15.273]  They aren't trying to solve the problem.
[01:03:15.493 --> 01:03:17.013]  Their aims are darker than that.
[01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.574]  Press a little bit and you'll see it.
[01:03:19.094 --> 01:03:20.214]  Sensible gun reforms?
[01:03:20.234 --> 01:03:20.974]  You hear that phrase a lot.
[01:03:20.994 --> 01:03:22.555]  You heard it all day today on cable news.
[01:03:23.075 --> 01:03:24.075]  What exactly does that mean?
[01:03:24.495 --> 01:03:25.456]  Sensible gun reforms?
[01:03:25.556 --> 01:03:26.836]  Banning bump stocks?
[01:03:27.556 --> 01:03:27.676]  No.
[01:03:28.637 --> 01:03:35.659]  A piece on Vox.com today calls for a landmark gun control bill like the one Australia passed 22 years ago in 1996.
[01:03:35.819 --> 01:03:38.660]  That's the law that liberals are always telling you about.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.884]  But the Australian law wasn't gun control, and it wasn't a voluntary buyback, no matter what they tell you.
[01:03:45.384 --> 01:03:46.565]  It was gun confiscation.
[01:03:46.845 --> 01:03:50.667]  A wholesale, mandatory disarmament of the entire civilian population.
[01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:55.150]  Imagine what would happen if you tried that here, in this country.
[01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:59.633]  America is not Australia, for a bunch of reasons, including our history and our Bill of Rights.
[01:04:00.374 --> 01:04:09.020]  Imagine federal officials marching from house to house, seizing hundreds of millions of firearms from law-abiding citizens, and then fining and imprisoning those who resist.
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.982]  Vox approvingly calls this leadership.
[01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:15.204]  In fact, it's a recipe for bloodshed and civil war.
[01:04:15.304 --> 01:04:15.884]  It's nuts.
[01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:18.806]  Yet it is a common fantasy on the left.
[01:04:19.507 --> 01:04:21.948]  Dan Pfeiffer was a senior advisor to Barack Obama.
[01:04:21.968 --> 01:04:23.870]  Now he's a contributor at CNN, of course.
[01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:30.494]  Last fall, Pfeiffer wrote an article attacking his fellow Democrats for what he bluntly called fake moderation on guns.
[01:04:30.994 --> 01:04:31.835]  His advice was this.
[01:04:32.215 --> 01:04:38.319]  Stop pretending to respect the Constitution and instead focusing on appointing judges who will nullify it.
[01:04:38.719 --> 01:04:39.100]  The goal?
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.525]  Gun seizures, ammunition regulation, the disarmament of the American population.
[01:04:44.846 --> 01:04:48.570]  A country where only the people in charge have guns and everybody else obeys.
[01:04:49.831 --> 01:04:53.154]  In the wake of yesterday's shooting, Pfeiffer's piece is going viral on the left.
[01:04:53.575 --> 01:04:55.277]  What he wrote is what they believe.
[01:05:01.257 --> 01:05:06.000]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:11.824]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[01:05:11.904 --> 01:05:17.128]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there.
[01:05:17.188 --> 01:05:20.950]  We're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.

[01:05:29.036 --> 01:05:30.657]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.

[01:06:04.358 --> 01:06:10.039]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:12.240]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.240]  Alright, here I go.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:20.241]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:22.141 --> 01:06:24.502]  Are we seeing the earth?
[01:06:24.842 --> 01:06:26.122]  We've got it.
[01:06:26.702 --> 01:06:29.223]  Are we seeing the earth?
[01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:38.240]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.905]  But to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[01:06:43.325 --> 01:06:45.948]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:06:49.718 --> 01:06:49.918]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:49.938 --> 01:06:50.158]  Alex Jones.

[01:07:04.023 --> 01:07:04.243]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:04.263 --> 01:07:04.464]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:04.484 --> 01:07:04.704]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:04.744 --> 01:07:04.964]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:04.984 --> 01:07:05.224]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:05.244 --> 01:07:05.484]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:05.504 --> 01:07:05.744]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:05.764 --> 01:07:06.004]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:06.024 --> 01:07:06.284]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:06.304 --> 01:07:06.544]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:06.784]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:06.804 --> 01:07:07.025]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:07.045 --> 01:07:07.345]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:07.365 --> 01:07:07.565]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:07.585 --> 01:07:07.785]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:07.805 --> 01:07:08.045]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:08.065 --> 01:07:08.285]  Alex Jones
[01:07:08.565 --> 01:07:10.547]  If we were looking for him, we might speak with anyone.
[01:07:10.567 --> 01:07:12.208]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:07:12.248 --> 01:07:13.909]  There's a guy on the radio.
[01:07:13.969 --> 01:07:14.970]  His name is Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:15.970]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.351 --> 01:07:20.013]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:07:20.053 --> 01:07:21.914]  Time to stop submitting to this charity!
[01:07:21.934 --> 01:07:24.116]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[01:07:24.136 --> 01:07:25.797]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[01:07:25.977 --> 01:07:27.598]  Info Wars went even further.
[01:07:27.738 --> 01:07:30.881]  Info Wars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:07:31.141 --> 01:07:34.723]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:07:35.124 --> 01:07:36.685]  Nobody can dispute the fact
[01:07:37.365 --> 01:08:03.809]  InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars.com Info
[01:08:05.362 --> 01:08:10.887]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:17.914]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are well into the second hour broadcasting worldwide, and it just broke on DrugsReport.com, one of the big epic sirens going there.
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:37.363]  Mueller indicts 16 Russians, and I've got the indictment here in my hands.
[01:08:37.383 --> 01:08:40.907]  We'll be going over it for you right now here live.
[01:08:41.947 --> 01:08:43.389]  Now again, he can only indict
[01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:50.498]  Two people so far, not for Russian collusion, but for making false statements to the FBI.
[01:08:51.018 --> 01:08:56.401]  This being the same special division of the FBI created by the Clintons and others that covers up for their crimes.
[01:08:57.262 --> 01:09:01.184]  But now they're just going to go after Russians, they claim.
[01:09:02.486 --> 01:09:03.707]  Were involved in the elections.
[01:09:04.727 --> 01:09:15.793]  But it was actually Russians giving fake intel to Hillary and then she was paying money via Fusion GPS and getting money from Uranium One by the tens of millions of dollars.
[01:09:15.813 --> 01:09:16.214]  But oh!
[01:09:16.954 --> 01:09:17.914]  Let's see if they're in there.
[01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:26.279]  Russians indicted in special counsel's probe for operations allegedly supporting Donald Trump in the election.
[01:09:26.699 --> 01:09:29.461]  Ah, nothing to do with Hillary.
[01:09:30.967 --> 01:09:36.011]  The special counsel's office said Friday the federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals.
[01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:37.372]  That's a swamp out of D.C.
[01:09:37.452 --> 01:09:37.813]  did that.
[01:09:38.293 --> 01:09:46.880]  Now remember, they had the lady running against Putin, funded by Soros, go to the prayer meeting last week and said that she was there for Trump because she is foreign.
[01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:48.922]  Even though it's the opposite.
[01:09:49.322 --> 01:09:49.562]  Who knows?
[01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:52.305]  They could be indicting their own people that make stuff up.
[01:09:52.745 --> 01:09:59.470]  The special counsel's office said Friday that a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities.
[01:10:00.481 --> 01:10:17.826]  In the probe into interference in the 2016 elections, the indictment says that the defendants allegedly, by early to mid 2006, when they started the giant wiretaps they said didn't exist, were supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaging Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:19.022 --> 01:10:27.747]  You can have all the other foreign governments and the UN and the Pope involved in our election and Saudi Arabia, but they're saying they can't even prove these Russians were involved trying to help Trump.
[01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:28.788]  That's Russian collusion.
[01:10:29.108 --> 01:10:30.188]  Not that Trump was involved.
[01:10:30.228 --> 01:10:30.849]  See how that works?
[01:10:32.109 --> 01:10:38.453]  An announcement from the special counsel Robert Mueller's office said that the government accuses all the defendants of conspiracy to defraud the United States.
[01:10:38.893 --> 01:10:43.176]  Three defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.
[01:10:43.216 --> 01:10:45.357]  Five defendants are charged with aggravated identity theft.
[01:10:46.601 --> 01:10:48.444]  Oh my gosh, you can see it now.
[01:10:48.464 --> 01:10:51.648]  Oh, some of them might have been staying here illegally.
[01:10:51.668 --> 01:10:55.954]  Kind of like your maid might be here illegally and gave you a fake social security number.
[01:10:57.156 --> 01:10:58.718]  And they might have wired money wrong.
[01:10:58.738 --> 01:11:00.761]  I mean, that just is the tell-tale signs.
[01:11:02.136 --> 01:11:03.217]  And then here is the indictment.
[01:11:03.237 --> 01:11:05.499]  It's now up on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:07.361]  United States of America.
[01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:09.483]  That means the Clinton Crime Syndicate.
[01:11:10.564 --> 01:11:13.066]  You should scratch that out, but Clinton Crime Inc.
[01:11:15.168 --> 01:11:17.330]  versus who knows.
[01:11:18.471 --> 01:11:20.133]  And then it just goes into it here.
[01:11:22.213 --> 01:11:23.613]  The United States of America.
[01:11:23.633 --> 01:11:26.414]  Don't you love how that's who this guy supposedly is?
[01:11:26.994 --> 01:11:28.094]  And then you go through all these.
[01:11:28.574 --> 01:11:30.055]  Concord Catering!
[01:11:30.355 --> 01:11:34.155]  Oh, I bet the Russians tried to get catering business.
[01:11:36.616 --> 01:11:37.276]  Oh my gosh.
[01:11:37.476 --> 01:11:39.437]  Concord Management and Consulting.
[01:11:39.457 --> 01:11:43.677]  And you start reading this.
[01:11:45.298 --> 01:11:45.778]  Oh yes.
[01:11:46.957 --> 01:11:50.978]  They're saying they had social media accounts that weren't in their proper names.
[01:11:50.998 --> 01:11:52.738]  They're calling that wire fraud now.
[01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:59.780]  See, I mean, wow, this is... Man, I thought it was like meeting with Trump with a suitcase of money.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.320]  No, no, no.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.300]  Defendants also used the stolen identities of real U.S.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:06.721]  persons to post on organization-controlled social media accounts.
[01:12:07.361 --> 01:12:12.282]  Over time, the social media accounts became defendants' means to reach significant numbers of Americans.
[01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.043]  So, they're going to claim that these guys
[01:12:16.459 --> 01:12:17.759]  You said they were somebody else.
[01:12:17.779 --> 01:12:20.900]  You mean like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, and all the government bots?
[01:12:22.961 --> 01:12:23.241]  Wow.
[01:12:27.282 --> 01:12:32.064]  Certain defendants travel the United States under false pretenses for the purpose of collecting intelligence.
[01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:32.404]  Oh.
[01:12:33.284 --> 01:12:37.065]  So again, lied on visas to inform defendants' operations.
[01:12:37.085 --> 01:12:44.928]  Defendants also procured and used computer infrastructure used partly in the United States to hide the Russian origin of their activities to avoid detection.
[01:12:44.948 --> 01:12:45.908]  I mean, this is nothing!
[01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:49.853]  Oh my gosh, some Russians came here and had some social media accounts.
[01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:51.234]  Man, this is just bombshell.
[01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:53.937]  And I'm reading this.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:00.023]  It said they tried to do business with other U.S.
[01:13:00.063 --> 01:13:02.425]  companies, not revealing they were Russians.
[01:13:09.153 --> 01:13:13.816]  And as they said, obtained visas through false and fraudulent statements.
[01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:14.237]  That's it!
[01:13:14.917 --> 01:13:17.139]  You can read the cover thing and see that.
[01:13:17.379 --> 01:13:17.819]  Wow!
[01:13:21.302 --> 01:13:28.247]  And it says, starting in 2014, the defendants together tried to do business in the United States.
[01:13:30.549 --> 01:13:32.390]  I'm reading this, there's just nothing here.
[01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:33.651]  You normally put it right up front.
[01:13:36.233 --> 01:13:37.074]  So they tried to
[01:13:38.697 --> 01:13:40.398]  Get contracts for food catering.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:56.165]  Project Lakata had multiple components, some involving domestic audiences with the Russian Federation, others targeting foreign audiences in various countries, including the United States.
[01:13:57.305 --> 01:13:59.846]  So, again, like trying to shrink us from the internet, that's espionage.
[01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:05.449]  The organization monthly budget for the project, 73 million Russian rubles.
[01:14:07.726 --> 01:14:10.308]  Or $1,250,000 including approximately 1 million rubles in bonus payments.
[01:14:10.929 --> 01:14:19.135]  To conceal its involvement, Concord labeled the monies paid to the organization for Project Black Hat a payment to reveal the software support development.
[01:14:19.896 --> 01:14:23.519]  And again, the way they can even make that sound is, you got sub-companies and stuff, oh it's criminal.
[01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:25.740]  And then it just goes through all this.
[01:14:25.801 --> 01:14:28.142]  I mean, this is a nothing burger.
[01:14:28.643 --> 01:14:31.185]  But I'm just reading this here on air.
[01:14:34.468 --> 01:14:36.889]  They had data analysis for marketing?
[01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.031]  Oh my gosh.
[01:14:41.871 --> 01:14:43.252]  This is just ridiculous.
[01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:49.675]  They had a translator project, attempted to travel the United States under false pretenses.
[01:14:50.895 --> 01:14:52.336]  So they're saying somebody lied on a visa.
[01:14:52.356 --> 01:14:56.058]  I mean, you're not even supposed to get a visa to come to the U.S.
[01:14:56.098 --> 01:14:58.839]  You're supposed to be wide open, according to the left.
[01:15:01.477 --> 01:15:04.479]  Served on the Translator Project and operated multiple U.S.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.722]  personas that she used to post, monitor, and update social media content.
[01:15:10.263 --> 01:15:13.166]  So it looks like an ad agency for catering.
[01:15:13.186 --> 01:15:16.228]  Well there you go.
[01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:19.670]  Looks like they were selling some ham sandwiches.
[01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:22.052]  They always said you can indict a ham sandwich.
[01:15:23.273 --> 01:15:24.554]  Object of the conspiracy.
[01:15:25.868 --> 01:15:34.310]  The conspiracy has as its object impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the defendants to interfere with the U.S.
[01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:35.511]  political and electoral process.
[01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:40.992]  Well, this is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:41.852 --> 01:15:44.933]  And you heard, Tucker Carlson, they say, must be a Russian agent, too.
[01:15:44.953 --> 01:15:48.074]  Because he says he's not a Russian agent.
[01:15:48.956 --> 01:15:50.297]  And if you say or not, you must be.
[01:15:50.317 --> 01:15:56.340]  And Rand Paul didn't want to bomb Russian forces in Syria, so McCain said, you're a Russian agent.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.601]  We'll be back.
[01:16:04.965 --> 01:16:11.769]  I started working with some of the top labs in the country many years ago, but intensely the last year, to bring out a lot of new brands.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:30.493]  And I said, what is the cleanest, healthiest thing that goes after seasonal distress, the things that pollen and dust and all the trees and plants cause, but that doesn't have even herbs in it that speed up the metabolism and get you in a heightened state?
[01:16:30.513 --> 01:16:31.834]  Because sure, you're all jazzed up.
[01:16:31.854 --> 01:16:33.836]  Your body's going to ignore the fact that it's under attack.
[01:16:34.116 --> 01:16:38.199]  I said, what naturally deals with it, but helps the body in its own way actually heal it?
[01:16:38.659 --> 01:16:41.502]  And they said, well, that is Japanese quail eggs
[01:16:42.935 --> 01:16:47.176]  Type of quail, Japanese quail, fed a specific diet by the French.
[01:16:47.776 --> 01:16:49.136]  They discovered this like 40 years ago.
[01:16:49.196 --> 01:16:58.438]  It's not patented, not documented, but it's got better rates in the studies than placebos and then, you know, a lot of other products that are out there.
[01:16:58.478 --> 01:17:03.339]  So I continue to marvel at Mother Nature and what God gave us on this planet.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:10.421]  Because the results we've gotten just at the office, people with serious
[01:17:11.613 --> 01:17:14.116]  Issues with pollen, with dust, you name it.
[01:17:14.556 --> 01:17:17.380]  The results we've gotten with the pollen block have just been insane.
[01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:19.882]  And it just makes my head spin.
[01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:26.790]  Why did I not, suffering from this for so many years, not know about it when it has alleviated
[01:17:27.751 --> 01:17:30.013]  My issues, like I said, 70%.
[01:17:30.373 --> 01:17:33.235]  I mean, it has been a game changer.
[01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.516]  I still sneeze some.
[01:17:35.236 --> 01:17:40.540]  I still might have a little burning in my sinus, but the pounding headaches, the fog is gone.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.121]  And that's what personally happened for me.
[01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:44.562]  See what happens for you.
[01:17:44.622 --> 01:17:45.283]  Give us your review.
[01:17:45.603 --> 01:17:46.964]  We'd love to hear what you have to say.

[01:19:04.015 --> 01:19:15.084]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[01:19:15.564 --> 01:19:16.485]  This is Pollen Block.
[01:19:17.484 --> 01:19:29.738]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:34.083]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[01:19:34.543 --> 01:19:38.568]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet.
[01:19:39.028 --> 01:19:48.672]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:19:49.152 --> 01:19:51.993]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[01:19:56.434 --> 01:19:58.275]  888-253-3139 You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.711 --> 01:20:30.969]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:37.871]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:50.019]  We're going to have Roger Stone and Owen Schroer with us in the next segment, responding to Robert Mueller's latest attack on the election of President Trump in 2016, now 15 months ago.
[01:20:50.039 --> 01:20:58.944]  He's indicted people for process, not for Russian collusion, for supposedly giving false statements to the FBI, which that shouldn't even be a federal law.
[01:20:58.964 --> 01:21:00.085]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[01:21:00.385 --> 01:21:03.167]  It's all up to them and their belief that you've done that.
[01:21:04.235 --> 01:21:08.138]  And then, of course, the FBI gets constantly caught lying, covering up evidence, planting evidence.
[01:21:08.599 --> 01:21:14.384]  I mean, it's just biblical, especially the different political groups within it connected to the Clintons.
[01:21:14.984 --> 01:21:23.071]  And now they've indicted 16 Russians for running social networks and catering and some other stuff.
[01:21:23.091 --> 01:21:27.174]  So we're going to have all of that coming up with the latest details.
[01:21:27.975 --> 01:21:31.900]  We also have a Highline College on lockdown for shots fired.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.381]  We'll watch that as that unfolds.
[01:21:33.802 --> 01:21:38.688]  Several police agencies are responding to the Highline Community College campus report of shots fired.
[01:21:38.708 --> 01:21:40.450]  However, no shooting at the college has been confirmed.
[01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:42.832]  And I just hope there aren't any copycats.
[01:21:43.976 --> 01:21:48.441]  With what we've been seeing as we normally do with any type of mass shooting.
[01:21:48.481 --> 01:21:54.527]  With the mass shooting in Florida, deputies called to his home 39 times.
[01:21:54.548 --> 01:21:56.450]  FBI botched the case.
[01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.753]  YouTube professional school shooter was his name.
[01:22:00.254 --> 01:22:02.676]  Video wasn't a strong lead.
[01:22:02.696 --> 01:22:04.558]  The FBI said shooter calls for power.
[01:22:05.499 --> 01:22:07.000]  Uh, to detain, over post.
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.781]  Uh, he was on meds, emotionally fragile.
[01:22:09.821 --> 01:22:11.282]  That's an InfoWars.com article.
[01:22:12.122 --> 01:22:13.663]  Uh, demon voices he was hearing.
[01:22:13.723 --> 01:22:15.404]  He arrived in an Uber.
[01:22:15.884 --> 01:22:22.248]  Threats, hoaxes, anxiety, arrest, uneasiness, grip schools, sells a bulletproof backpack, sore.
[01:22:22.308 --> 01:22:23.188]  By the way, we sell those.
[01:22:23.728 --> 01:22:24.889]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:22:25.309 --> 01:22:26.170]  Everybody really should have one.
[01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:27.970]  They're very lightweight and they're a good shield.
[01:22:29.051 --> 01:22:30.852]  Uh, that's from Infidel Body Armor.
[01:22:31.492 --> 01:22:33.173]  And also we have several other great brands.
[01:22:33.513 --> 01:22:38.375]  Florida Students' Grandfather Survived 1949 School Massacre.
[01:22:38.835 --> 01:22:39.875]  Media Blamed Trump.
[01:22:39.935 --> 01:22:41.456]  Kimmel Says President Mentally Ill.
[01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:44.457]  Facebook Group Says Murder Republicans.
[01:22:44.917 --> 01:22:53.421]  And that's another Infowars.com article right there that's in the top of Drudge, right there at the bottom of the top links.
[01:22:54.462 --> 01:23:01.603]  And I'll go ahead and cover that report right now before we come back and get into the latest Mueller operations.
[01:23:03.095 --> 01:23:08.837]  Far-left group calls for murdering Republicans as revenge for Florida school shooting.
[01:23:09.657 --> 01:23:15.459]  And you saw Kimmel say it's Christians' fault, you dirty Christians, with money sticking out of your pockets.
[01:23:16.019 --> 01:23:16.880]  That was last night.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:21.221]  Dear crazed shooters, the GOP has frequent baseball practices.
[01:23:21.741 --> 01:23:23.682]  Well, we know one of your crazed shooters already did that.
[01:23:24.162 --> 01:23:29.924]  The far-left group of Facebook is calling for people to murder Republican lawmakers to support the NRA as revenge for the Florida school shooting.
[01:23:30.504 --> 01:23:40.368]  The unhinged post appeared on Facebook called, milkshakes against the Republican Party in the hours after the massacre at the Majority Stoneman, uh, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
[01:23:40.809 --> 01:23:43.590]  Dear crazed shooters, the GOP has frequent baseball practices.
[01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:45.291]  You really want to be remembered.
[01:23:45.611 --> 01:23:46.571]  That's how you do it.
[01:23:47.092 --> 01:23:51.253]  Signed, Americans tired of our political bathing in blood of the innocent.
[01:23:51.273 --> 01:23:52.254]  So kill some more people, right?
[01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:55.295]  For a few million dollars from the terrorist organization, R.A.
[01:23:55.595 --> 01:23:56.796]  states the post and goes on.
[01:23:57.316 --> 01:23:58.197]  From there.
[01:23:58.577 --> 01:23:59.438]  This is even bigger.
[01:23:59.798 --> 01:24:02.020]  Also another InfoWars.com story.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:09.105]  Fake news lie about Florida shooter being member of the white supremacist group.
[01:24:09.465 --> 01:24:11.187]  Turns out AP and others totally lied.
[01:24:11.227 --> 01:24:12.107]  No one ever said that.
[01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:12.928]  It wasn't true.
[01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:16.170]  He hadn't paramilitary trained at the group.
[01:24:17.271 --> 01:24:21.474]  But all the leftist media, including the AP, ran with it.
[01:24:21.534 --> 01:24:25.837]  And they're not retracting, even though other newspapers have.
[01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:28.952]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:29.654 --> 01:24:34.309]  Meanwhile, our story by Don Salazar is very lengthy, very detailed on DrugsReport.com.
[01:24:35.563 --> 01:24:37.404]  Again, it's posted to newswars.com.
[01:24:38.004 --> 01:24:45.688]  Family says Florida school shooter, autistic, may have been on medication, was hearing devil's voices, had been on vacation.
[01:24:45.908 --> 01:24:47.049]  They think he may have gone off of it.
[01:24:47.089 --> 01:24:52.832]  That's when you really know that the inserts say, especially if you go off it quickly, do not do that.
[01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:57.874]  I had a girlfriend that was a couple months back in college.
[01:24:57.914 --> 01:24:58.595]  It was a lot of fun.
[01:24:59.335 --> 01:25:00.136]  She was a nice girl.
[01:25:00.156 --> 01:25:01.117]  Her dad was a doctor.
[01:25:01.137 --> 01:25:04.880]  And she was just so happy and so nice.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.041]  And she was on Prozac.
[01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:07.102]  Actually on Prozac.
[01:25:07.422 --> 01:25:09.003]  Never meet anybody that's on the original Prozac.
[01:25:09.023 --> 01:25:09.864]  But she was on Prozac.
[01:25:10.925 --> 01:25:16.029]  And then she decided to go off of it.
[01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:23.536]  And about two days later, wasn't the sweet, giggly, bubbly, nymphomaniac anymore.
[01:25:24.136 --> 01:25:27.239]  She was gonna throw herself off a roof.
[01:25:29.002 --> 01:25:33.185]  When I got the phone call and I said, you know, I took care of her and got her to the family and everything.
[01:25:33.205 --> 01:25:35.826]  And then I said, we're not going to date anymore, sweetheart.
[01:25:36.427 --> 01:25:39.809]  But that's what that, I didn't even really understand she was on that stuff till later.
[01:25:40.748 --> 01:25:49.994]  But that's, I mean, they'll tell you 99% of the time they pull up at some house and a woman's cut her kid's arms off or ground them in the bathtub or driven them off in a car in a lake or shot them.
[01:25:50.435 --> 01:25:56.819]  Cops walk in, open the pillbox cabinet, the medicine cabinet, and it is Luvox.
[01:25:56.939 --> 01:26:00.341]  It is serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:26:00.361 --> 01:26:01.302]  It is there.
[01:26:04.324 --> 01:26:06.145]  It's almost like you don't even have to guess.
[01:26:06.225 --> 01:26:07.506]  It's just, you know it.
[01:26:07.546 --> 01:26:09.788]  And that's why I call them suicide mass murder pills.
[01:26:10.931 --> 01:26:16.993]  And those are still big advertisers on Fox and CNN, and I don't want to criticize Hannity, but I have the clip.
[01:26:17.033 --> 01:26:33.617]  I didn't get to it yesterday, just because I'm not going to go out of my way, but when I was on Piers Morgan 2013, they were going to have me on for a couple more segments, but I talked about, you're the ones that have all these serotonin reuptake inhibitor pill ads, mass murderer pill ads, the inserts, and I saw them going, cut, cut, cut, early to break, kick me off.
[01:26:34.098 --> 01:26:34.838]  They were so pissed.
[01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:40.924]  One of Hannity's people brought up the psychotropic drugs and everything, and Hannity cut him off.
[01:26:41.004 --> 01:26:45.226]  Now, that's why I played that Tucker Carlson, where he brought up the drugs.
[01:26:46.006 --> 01:26:58.469]  So, I guess Fox has got a better standard than CNN and does allow that kind of stuff to come out, or I guess... I guess Tucker Carlson can do whatever he wants on Fox, and that's a good thing.
[01:26:59.789 --> 01:27:01.050]  And I really like Tucker.
[01:27:03.766 --> 01:27:05.667]  Tucker saw it outcome on my show some.
[01:27:06.407 --> 01:27:09.689]  I guess getting his bodafidi straight before he became Mr. Libertarian, which is great.
[01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:14.391]  He's always been a libertarian, but kind of became his true self a lot more hardcore than he was on CNN, which I think is great.
[01:27:15.851 --> 01:27:18.993]  I've asked him on a few times, and he's like, eh, Fox doesn't let me, sorry.
[01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:19.633]  Which is true.
[01:27:20.093 --> 01:27:23.075]  Like Napolitano used to want to come on, I used to go on his show, and then they banned it.
[01:27:23.595 --> 01:27:31.639]  And it's just like, you know, that's the News Corp folks, because they want to control the Liberty Movement, not just have the Liberty Movement control the country.
[01:27:32.259 --> 01:27:34.160]  But I'm digressing.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:38.702]  We'll come back with the big breaking news on the Russian indictment.
[01:27:39.243 --> 01:27:39.603]  We've got
[01:27:41.238 --> 01:27:43.120]  Sixteen Russians indicted by Mueller.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.541]  It looks like we're having crooked toenails.
[01:27:44.862 --> 01:27:50.987]  We'll have all the details for you on the other side of the quick break with Roger Stone and with Owen Troyer.
[01:27:52.008 --> 01:27:56.673]  But before we go there, just please don't forget, we're running a special of the weekend and then it's got to stop.
[01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:06.907]  That is our super high quality, super blue toothpaste for adults and children, and the fortified concentrated mouthwash as well with colloidal silver iodine.
[01:28:06.947 --> 01:28:09.369]  So good for the gums, so good for going up for bacteria and viruses.
[01:28:09.989 --> 01:28:15.233]  Concentrated toothpaste, no fillers, 50% off, fortified with iodine and colloidal silver.
[01:28:15.774 --> 01:28:18.716]  You can go to InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:28:18.736 --> 01:28:19.636]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[01:28:23.599 --> 01:28:24.619]  It becomes a loss leader.
[01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:26.420]  You get an additional 10% off.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.982]  You've got 95% reviews by Power Reviews, third-party site.
[01:28:30.922 --> 01:28:35.043]  It is just $6.72, ladies and gentlemen, when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:28:35.824 --> 01:28:39.485]  I mean, we're basically giving it away at that because it's so concentrated and so high quality.
[01:28:39.905 --> 01:28:45.067]  Other leading toothpastes, as we know, may have a half dollar a product, and ours has several dollars a product in it.
[01:28:45.427 --> 01:28:46.268]  Nobody does that.
[01:28:46.328 --> 01:28:47.748]  That's why we are the best.
[01:28:48.129 --> 01:28:48.669]  Super Blue.
[01:28:49.449 --> 01:28:53.254]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:28:53.755 --> 01:29:00.123]  Alright, we'll be back with the latest in the deep state war in America.
[01:29:00.143 --> 01:29:02.786]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:29:02.826 --> 01:29:03.127]  Go ahead.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.941]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:29:05.981 --> 01:29:15.388]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:29:16.489 --> 01:29:19.851]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:29:20.311 --> 01:29:20.651]  Absolutely.
[01:29:43.085 --> 01:29:55.980]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:30:03.413 --> 01:30:08.176]  Now, joining us is a best-selling author and researcher, Michael Malice.
[01:30:09.096 --> 01:30:10.097]  MichaelMalice.com.
[01:30:10.117 --> 01:30:13.758]  He grew up behind the Iron Curtain, so he understands the tyranny of collectivism.
[01:30:13.778 --> 01:30:15.339]  He's at Twitter, at Michael Malice.
[01:30:15.399 --> 01:30:19.962]  He's written Dear Reader, Kim Jong-il, and he's been over there and researched it.
[01:30:20.002 --> 01:30:24.104]  So again, Michael Malice, author of The Dear Reader, about North Korea.
[01:30:24.704 --> 01:30:28.126]  Give us your expert take on where we are right now and the chances for war over there.
[01:30:28.526 --> 01:30:30.067]  I talk about this heavily in my book.
[01:30:30.187 --> 01:30:36.268]  If you look at these countries, Libya is a great example, Iraq and several others.
[01:30:36.428 --> 01:30:41.790]  When the countries liberalize, Romania was the example Kim Jong Il himself used.
[01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:45.571]  When these countries liberalize, very often the people at the top are shot.
[01:30:46.111 --> 01:30:46.971]  And with good reason.
[01:30:46.991 --> 01:30:49.152]  You look at Gaddafi, he was sodomized to death.
[01:30:49.452 --> 01:30:50.713]  Saddam Hussein was hung.
[01:30:51.073 --> 01:30:53.894]  And Libya had a nascent nuclear program.
[01:30:54.254 --> 01:30:55.474]  They agreed to give it up.
[01:30:55.554 --> 01:30:57.715]  And what happened is, right now you have slavery there.
[01:30:58.155 --> 01:31:02.517]  So North Korea very quickly realized that the best defense is a good offense.
[01:31:03.077 --> 01:31:09.339]  Kim Jong Il said he wants to turn the country into a hedgehog, meaning one with nuclear missile spines pointing in every direction.
[01:31:09.799 --> 01:31:17.825]  And if you think about it, how much easier... I don't think they would have been running their mouths to this point if they didn't have nukes or at least some very, very strong weaponry.
[01:31:18.125 --> 01:31:19.286]  Something would have happened to him.
[01:31:19.386 --> 01:31:22.448]  So they are very conniving in their hold on power.
[01:31:22.748 --> 01:31:25.890]  They're very interested in self-preservation.
[01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:34.296]  And unfortunately, it's at the expense of the, you know, 25 million North Korean population who are the victims in this horrible decades-long atrocity.
[01:31:34.776 --> 01:31:44.467]  Don't they know the calculus has changed and that the whole strategy of patience and then the globalists using North Korea as a strategy of tension, that that is coming to an end?
[01:31:44.607 --> 01:31:46.730]  It is coming to an end and they're scared.
[01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:50.895]  And they're clearly scared and you see that they're reaching out to South Korea, their arch rival.
[01:31:51.415 --> 01:31:57.119]  It's some kind of China very publicly last year and in the recent months has been turning their backs on them.
[01:31:57.459 --> 01:31:59.660]  Russia to some extent has been turning their backs on them.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:08.486]  You know, Putin liked the idea that North Korea could kind of be a thorn in our side, but even he's not going to be defending, you know, concentration camps and starving children for political purposes.
[01:32:08.746 --> 01:32:10.087]  He's a far cry from Stalin.
[01:32:10.467 --> 01:32:13.929]  So North Korea has been an international embarrassment, especially
[01:32:14.309 --> 01:32:18.732]  For China, although they do serve a purpose, but China wants to have this dignified appearance.
[01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:19.673]  The Olympics!
[01:32:19.953 --> 01:32:25.097]  Is there any bigger symbol of global cooperation that, you know, that South Korea is having the Olympics now?
[01:32:25.417 --> 01:32:29.841]  This is, every country is turning their back on the North and they don't know what to do.
[01:32:29.901 --> 01:32:31.722]  This is kind of uncharted territory for them.
[01:32:32.022 --> 01:32:32.523]  Thank God.
[01:32:32.563 --> 01:32:39.468]  And I'm not saying this is the end of the North Korean regime, which I pray every day that it is, but if this were the end, this is what the end would look like.
[01:32:39.748 --> 01:32:48.312]  They are a hostage nation of just people who don't even know what planet they're on, and that's why they're the greatest victims, people under communism.
[01:32:48.352 --> 01:32:51.814]  Michael Malice, the book, Dear Reader, available everywhere on Twitter.
[01:32:51.854 --> 01:32:53.915]  Michael Malice, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:54.596]  I appreciate you.
[01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:55.836]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:07.182]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.249 --> 01:33:27.463]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.282 --> 01:33:34.784]  Well, remember about a month and a half ago, the last big wave of fake news?
[01:33:35.805 --> 01:33:38.426]  They're desperate with only two indictments previously of U.S.
[01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:44.029]  citizens for not being colluding with Russians, but for supposedly giving false statements to the FBI about side issues.
[01:33:44.409 --> 01:33:48.852]  Those stories have all fallen apart as Russiagate has been exposed as a Democratic Party operation.
[01:33:49.332 --> 01:33:52.594]  But remember Behar when she announced, General Flynn admits he's a Russian agent.
[01:33:52.934 --> 01:33:53.914]  He's going to testify.
[01:33:53.934 --> 01:33:55.175]  They helped run the whole campaign.
[01:33:55.195 --> 01:33:56.095]  Yay, we got him!
[01:33:56.356 --> 01:33:56.856]  Remember that?
[01:33:58.931 --> 01:33:59.392]  Breaking news.
[01:33:59.692 --> 01:34:00.372]  Oh my god.
[01:34:00.972 --> 01:34:01.853]  Oh, breaking news.
[01:34:02.053 --> 01:34:14.519]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!
[01:34:14.559 --> 01:34:14.639]  Yay!
[01:34:14.839 --> 01:34:16.620]  We'll kill the economy!
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:17.841]  Our president's a traitor!
[01:34:17.861 --> 01:34:18.501]  Yay!
[01:34:18.521 --> 01:34:20.202]  F America over!
[01:34:20.222 --> 01:34:20.282]  Yay!
[01:34:20.642 --> 01:34:24.064]  I mean, that would be horrible even if I hated Obama or something.
[01:34:24.084 --> 01:34:25.805]  If that came out, I'd be like, God, this is horrible.
[01:34:26.385 --> 01:34:27.906]  But at least we're cleaning it up.
[01:34:28.006 --> 01:34:29.026]  It's totally made up.
[01:34:29.046 --> 01:34:30.007]  The Clintons are up their eyeballs.
[01:34:30.447 --> 01:34:33.349]  So now Mueller can't find Trump, his family.
[01:34:33.369 --> 01:34:35.029]  He can't even get obstruction on them.
[01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:37.210]  So now to have something.
[01:34:37.231 --> 01:34:38.071]  This is face-saving.
[01:34:38.411 --> 01:34:45.375]  It just hit me, Ellen Schreuer, that they're going to go after low-level Russians that were running catering services and online consulting and had
[01:34:46.355 --> 01:34:49.701]  And, you know, OORT, you know, had some bots.
[01:34:49.761 --> 01:34:52.425]  Yeah, because they got sold an ad package by Twitter.
[01:34:52.725 --> 01:34:56.411]  That's what they come and advertise to you of what story to run that are popular in the U.S.
[01:34:56.792 --> 01:34:57.874]  during the election, you know.
[01:34:59.526 --> 01:35:03.369]  So, so, that's all they've got, so he's just desperately wanting to find something.
[01:35:03.429 --> 01:35:10.294]  Indicting 13 no-name Russians and three companies that are just beyond small potatoes.
[01:35:10.334 --> 01:35:16.258]  You know, you get the thing of french fries, and you eat all the, and then there's like little tiny burned bits at the bottom that aren't even worth eating.
[01:35:16.278 --> 01:35:18.659]  I mean, these are like a speck of a speck.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:22.942]  There's like, I've read the indictment now, almost all of it, you've read over it, but it doesn't matter.
[01:35:22.962 --> 01:35:27.746]  Like you said, Owen, Twitter is like, my god, it's like, oh, we caught, we caught,
[01:35:28.186 --> 01:35:32.269]  We caught Trump, you know, Putin's wee-wee holster.
[01:35:32.289 --> 01:35:33.990]  You know, we caught him in bed with Putin.
[01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.510]  It's over!
[01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:35.090]  Yay!
[01:35:35.451 --> 01:35:47.098]  Well, there's nothing even in this that I've seen that even mentions Trump other than these Russian bots they're saying on social media that are tweeting about Trump, forming social media groups about Trump, and we'll get to that in a second.
[01:35:47.138 --> 01:35:49.279]  But think about the timing of this, Alex.
[01:35:49.319 --> 01:35:50.140]  They released it
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.361]  The week of the Florida shooting.
[01:35:52.401 --> 01:36:07.293]  While the Florida shooting is dominating the media, the Florida shooting is dominating everything, the Democrats are freaking out, and then they just insert this kind of in the back burner like, oh yeah, here's our Russian collusion, here's the official document, while everyone is still talking about the shooters and talking about the shooting.
[01:36:07.333 --> 01:36:16.221]  So, they released this intentionally, I think, while everyone was talking about the shooting, so that nobody will actually dig into the nuts and bolts in this, because it's nothing.
[01:36:16.461 --> 01:36:17.322]  It's incredible.
[01:36:17.602 --> 01:36:20.344]  If they're going to indict people- Well, I mean, they did have Facebook.
[01:36:20.404 --> 01:36:21.665]  Facebook accounts and catering.
[01:36:21.805 --> 01:36:26.949]  But if they're going to be indicting people over fake Facebook accounts, I mean, where are they going to start?
[01:36:26.969 --> 01:36:28.370]  There's about a hundred of them of me.
[01:36:29.091 --> 01:36:29.751]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:36:29.771 --> 01:36:32.293]  So it's like, how can you use this as an indictment?
[01:36:32.413 --> 01:36:37.497]  But see, that's why they sent out hundreds of thousands of letters now saying, you're all Russian bots.
[01:36:37.517 --> 01:36:40.059]  And then even Twitter did a study and said, these are real people.
[01:36:40.099 --> 01:36:41.160]  These are not Russian bots.
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.043]  No, I've got the Russian collusion right here.
[01:36:43.103 --> 01:36:55.421]  According to Mueller's indictment, on April 6, 2016, an excerpt from a Russian advertisement says, you know, a great number of black people support us saying that Hillary Clinton is not my president.
[01:36:55.621 --> 01:36:56.642]  That was from a Russian bot.
[01:36:56.682 --> 01:36:57.403]  That's Russian collusion.
[01:36:58.464 --> 01:36:59.385]  That's their proof!
[01:36:59.445 --> 01:37:00.645]  April 7th here, Alex.
[01:37:00.705 --> 01:37:01.126]  April 7th.
[01:37:01.526 --> 01:37:03.147]  I say no to Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:03.167 --> 01:37:04.588]  I say no to manipulation.
[01:37:04.608 --> 01:37:05.869]  That was paid for by a Russian bot.
[01:37:06.089 --> 01:37:06.469]  We've got him.
[01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.890]  We've got him right here, Alex.
[01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:10.112]  We've got him on October 14th.
[01:37:10.392 --> 01:37:11.793]  We've got him right here on October 14th.
[01:37:12.153 --> 01:37:18.937]  Among all candidates, Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend all police from terrorists.
[01:37:18.997 --> 01:37:19.578]  It's right there.
[01:37:19.678 --> 01:37:20.839]  It's right there in the document.
[01:37:20.879 --> 01:37:24.301]  And that means if these marketing companies piggybacked
[01:37:24.901 --> 01:37:27.944]  On anything else people were putting out, the whole thing's a fraud.
[01:37:27.964 --> 01:37:28.544]  This is what they say.
[01:37:28.784 --> 01:37:38.031]  They say if any Russian marketing of any type is connected to anything, even though they admit it's less than 1% of the internet activity, the truth is the Russians are not good at this.
[01:37:38.452 --> 01:37:39.933]  What about Hollywood?
[01:37:40.193 --> 01:37:48.880]  What about the big Hollywood firms admitted they created over 100 fake news accounts and flooded the web with fake news against Trump and against America?
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:51.061]  Last night, my son wanted to watch TV.
[01:37:51.101 --> 01:37:52.723]  We turned on Netflix I never look at.
[01:37:54.082 --> 01:37:54.523]  Hardly ever.
[01:37:54.623 --> 01:38:00.269]  And it was, it was like, I was like, I've seen 10 different documentaries in here about Trump being a shyster.
[01:38:00.970 --> 01:38:04.434]  And so I watched one of them with my son last night and it was all made up crap.
[01:38:04.535 --> 01:38:09.380]  I mean, it's like you, you know, he's good because Hollywood, everybody hates him.
[01:38:09.681 --> 01:38:13.005]  And then exactly tell people what page that's on, because this is where they show.
[01:38:13.365 --> 01:38:14.025]  This is on page 20 of 37.
[01:38:43.805 --> 01:38:45.706]  Join our Hillary Clinton for President.
[01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:50.049]  I created Hillary for President 2016, not the Russians!
[01:38:50.169 --> 01:38:55.192]  And you can probably find the date that we started that was before any of these tweets that they're making.
[01:38:55.212 --> 01:38:56.873]  No, no, we've been selling that shirt.
[01:38:56.953 --> 01:38:59.154]  We've been selling that shirt for like six months.
[01:38:59.514 --> 01:39:00.194]  Watch out, Alex.
[01:39:00.214 --> 01:39:01.235]  They're going to indict you next.
[01:39:01.275 --> 01:39:03.116]  Donald wants to defeat terrorism.
[01:39:03.476 --> 01:39:04.516]  Hillary wants to sponsor.
[01:39:04.536 --> 01:39:05.557]  Well, that was us saying that.
[01:39:06.397 --> 01:39:07.198]  Vote Republican.
[01:39:07.238 --> 01:39:07.798]  Vote Trump.
[01:39:07.818 --> 01:39:08.638]  Support the Second Amendment.
[01:39:08.879 --> 01:39:09.639]  Oh, my God!
[01:39:09.939 --> 01:39:11.840]  They even said the Second Amendment is now Russian.
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:15.362]  I've seen newscasts where they say, they say, oh, The Washington Post.
[01:39:15.662 --> 01:39:16.802]  That was two weeks ago.
[01:39:16.922 --> 01:39:17.603]  That was Schiff.
[01:39:18.183 --> 01:39:20.044]  He said the second amendment's a Russian plot.
[01:39:20.864 --> 01:39:22.024]  There's a press conference!
[01:39:22.184 --> 01:39:23.685]  No, I know, the Washington Post published it.
[01:39:23.745 --> 01:39:25.865]  Here, here, here, go back to this, go back to this.
[01:39:26.465 --> 01:39:28.566]  Hillary Clinton doesn't deserve the black vote.
[01:39:28.906 --> 01:39:32.567]  That's Roger Stone and us exposing, you know how she said blacks aren't human.
[01:39:32.607 --> 01:39:34.448]  We said that a year before that.
[01:39:34.488 --> 01:39:35.808]  Notice all these are our talking points.
[01:39:35.868 --> 01:39:37.428]  It's all us, because we're vicious.
[01:39:37.448 --> 01:39:38.209]  And it's all after we said it.
[01:39:38.289 --> 01:39:40.569]  Trump is our only hope for a better future.
[01:39:40.649 --> 01:39:42.770]  So if anything, we're influencing Russia.
[01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:44.111]  Hashtag Hillary for prison.
[01:39:44.331 --> 01:39:48.275]  I sat there over two years ago in that office.
[01:39:48.475 --> 01:39:49.115]  You didn't build it.
[01:39:49.195 --> 01:39:51.357]  And I said hashtag Hillary for prison.
[01:39:51.758 --> 01:39:52.839]  I created that.
[01:39:54.526 --> 01:39:55.126]  I did!
[01:39:55.146 --> 01:39:56.027]  I created that!
[01:39:56.247 --> 01:39:56.848]  That's me!
[01:39:57.048 --> 01:39:58.148]  You didn't start that hashtag?
[01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:59.509]  You didn't start that business?
[01:39:59.529 --> 01:40:02.551]  Well she gave me the credit before she said I'm a dark evil heart and I came up with it.
[01:40:02.711 --> 01:40:05.373]  We cannot trust Hillary Clinton to take care of our veterans.
[01:40:06.193 --> 01:40:06.914]  Who said that?
[01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:07.354]  The truth?
[01:40:08.214 --> 01:40:12.857]  Among all the candidates, Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists.
[01:40:13.077 --> 01:40:16.479]  Remember that was a Black Lives Matter and CNN was saying cops deserve to die.
[01:40:16.499 --> 01:40:16.720]  Remember?
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.401]  Hillary is a Satan.
[01:40:18.841 --> 01:40:23.604]  Well I mean I'm the one who said that and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is.
[01:40:24.104 --> 01:40:25.426]  These are Alex Jones quotes, I believe.
[01:40:25.826 --> 01:40:26.768]  Let's keep rolling down here.
[01:40:26.808 --> 01:40:27.569]  You're Russian.
[01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.969]  This is it.
[01:40:27.989 --> 01:40:32.195]  They're going to say Alex Jones is Russian from Russians stealing your talking points.
[01:40:34.461 --> 01:40:35.302]  But here's the other thing, Alex.
[01:40:35.342 --> 01:40:45.151]  What they do is, they try to trick you, where if you just read the introduction, they're like, oh, well, various social media accounts, and then bank fraud and wire fraud, and then you get into it.
[01:40:45.552 --> 01:40:50.837]  The only bank fraud was Russians allegedly, according to this, stealing U.S.
[01:40:50.897 --> 01:40:54.301]  identities to make bank accounts to then pay for political advertisement.
[01:40:54.321 --> 01:40:56.142]  So again, nothing to do with Trump.
[01:40:56.423 --> 01:40:57.484]  That's the bank's fault!
[01:40:58.104 --> 01:41:03.505]  Well, by the way, you've got the EU, you've got the Vatican, you've got Obama telling foreigners to vote.
[01:41:03.865 --> 01:41:06.306]  You've got Hillary Foundation getting billions of dollars.
[01:41:06.346 --> 01:41:07.526]  Let's bring Roger Stone in.
[01:41:07.846 --> 01:41:08.766]  He's out on the road right now.
[01:41:08.786 --> 01:41:11.787]  He's here in Austin taking care of some business, so he's not in studio with us.
[01:41:12.187 --> 01:41:14.688]  Roger, what in Toledo do you make of this?
[01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:17.188]  Because, I mean, I'd read much of the indictment.
[01:41:17.228 --> 01:41:20.869]  I hadn't read the Alex Jones quotes, and I'm not trying to take credit where it's not due.
[01:41:21.249 --> 01:41:25.030]  Most of these came directly out of my mouth, a few of them out of yours.
[01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:30.892]  So they're taking American talking points that we put out way before these bots ever arrived.
[01:41:31.152 --> 01:41:34.974]  These bots jumped on the bandwagon, like anybody does in advertising.
[01:41:34.994 --> 01:41:36.494]  That's what you do is hijack memes.
[01:41:36.835 --> 01:41:38.755]  And then now this is the proof, Roger.
[01:41:39.075 --> 01:41:45.998]  So Hillary for prison 2016 isn't a t-shirt we sold 100,000 of that filled the RNC.
[01:41:46.358 --> 01:41:47.839]  No, it's a Russian bot, Roger.
[01:41:48.925 --> 01:41:49.946]  Yeah, where's the collusion?
[01:41:50.246 --> 01:41:53.848]  Where's the coordination and conspiracy with the Trump campaign?
[01:41:53.928 --> 01:41:55.069]  Nowhere in this indictment.
[01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:59.512]  This is meant to bolster Mueller's sagging public relations.
[01:41:59.632 --> 01:42:02.054]  I think people have caught on to the fact that he has nothing.
[01:42:02.554 --> 01:42:05.877]  So he goes out and he indicts a bunch of low-level Russians.
[01:42:06.717 --> 01:42:12.120]  Yet, where's the connection to the Trump campaign, Trump's family, Trump's campaign, Trump's associates?
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:12.460]  There's nothing.
[01:42:12.501 --> 01:42:13.441]  He has none of that.
[01:42:13.621 --> 01:42:16.763]  Therefore, by definition, it reminds me of the old sandwich.
[01:42:16.823 --> 01:42:19.665]  I could have a ham sandwich if I had some ham.
[01:42:20.125 --> 01:42:22.726]  This guy has nothing, and this just kind of proves it.
[01:42:22.906 --> 01:42:23.987]  It's pathetic, really.
[01:42:24.507 --> 01:42:25.588]  Well, that's why I made the joke.
[01:42:26.148 --> 01:42:34.433]  One of the businesses was catering, and so it appears they do have ham sandwiches on their menu, so the FBI has indicted a ham sandwich.
[01:42:36.446 --> 01:42:38.747]  They always said the FBI wouldn't die to hand stairs.
[01:42:38.767 --> 01:42:39.747]  They finally got it.
[01:42:39.787 --> 01:42:40.888]  Hold on, Roger.
[01:42:42.028 --> 01:42:43.869]  We're gonna let you off the floor.
[01:42:44.269 --> 01:42:44.949]  We gotta go to break.
[01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.709]  Stay there, Roger.
[01:42:45.729 --> 01:42:46.269]  We gotta go to break.
[01:42:46.690 --> 01:42:51.511]  We're back with Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, the guy they claim is the chief Russian mastermind.
[01:42:53.832 --> 01:42:57.333]  We don't have a single original thought unless Putin tells us.
[01:42:57.353 --> 01:42:58.314]  Now get on the phone.
[01:42:58.474 --> 01:42:59.254]  Putin's latest orders.
[01:43:00.208 --> 01:43:09.212]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:43:09.292 --> 01:43:17.536]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:43:17.696 --> 01:43:22.398]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:43:22.578 --> 01:43:26.239]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.241]  We're good to go!
[01:43:51.423 --> 01:43:57.574]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:43:57.734 --> 01:43:59.417]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:44:04.605 --> 01:44:07.687]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:44:07.727 --> 01:44:08.247]  You're on the air.
[01:44:08.267 --> 01:44:09.428]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:09.448 --> 01:44:10.289]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:44:10.509 --> 01:44:11.109]  Hey, brother.
[01:44:11.409 --> 01:44:11.770]  Good, man.
[01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:12.610]  Thank you for calling.
[01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:17.734]  Hey, I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:44:17.954 --> 01:44:24.318]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:44:24.338 --> 01:44:26.159]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[01:44:26.259 --> 01:44:33.204]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:44:33.564 --> 01:44:34.685]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:44:34.725 --> 01:44:38.747]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:44:39.127 --> 01:44:40.808]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:44:41.188 --> 01:44:41.948]  And exactly.
[01:44:41.968 --> 01:44:46.211]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:46.811]  Boom!
[01:44:46.951 --> 01:44:49.792]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:44:49.852 --> 01:44:50.373]  It's amazing.
[01:44:50.433 --> 01:44:54.795]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:45:00.198 --> 01:45:00.998]  Mike in Arizona.
[01:45:01.018 --> 01:45:02.059]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:45:02.099 --> 01:45:02.399]  Go ahead.
[01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:05.222]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:45:05.262 --> 01:45:14.672]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:45:15.773 --> 01:45:19.157]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:45:19.677 --> 01:45:22.019]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.382]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:45:24.482 --> 01:45:24.862]  Thank you.
[01:45:25.543 --> 01:45:28.005]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:45:28.025 --> 01:45:31.769]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:35.332]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:45:35.372 --> 01:45:36.353]  They are quality.
[01:45:36.694 --> 01:45:37.935]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:45:38.415 --> 01:45:41.138]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:45:41.318 --> 01:45:41.839]  Absolutely.
[01:45:42.359 --> 01:45:55.272]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:46:00.091 --> 01:46:02.854]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:46:03.494 --> 01:46:07.057]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:46:07.458 --> 01:46:10.400]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:46:10.801 --> 01:46:12.782]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:46:13.343 --> 01:46:17.767]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:46:18.087 --> 01:46:20.149]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:46:20.429 --> 01:46:26.815]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:46:27.435 --> 01:46:34.663]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:46:35.624 --> 01:46:40.289]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:46:40.689 --> 01:46:47.676]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:46:48.317 --> 01:46:52.780]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:56.063]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:46:56.083 --> 01:46:57.784]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:23.517 --> 01:47:24.457]  This is incredible.
[01:47:24.477 --> 01:47:27.779]  The Republic, from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:28.339 --> 01:47:30.220]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.193 --> 01:47:42.919]  Now ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, tried to shotgun with us, InfoWars host of the War Room, along with Roger, we have Owen Schroeder here with us.
[01:47:43.419 --> 01:47:50.262]  Here is the big giant news breaking right now.
[01:47:50.282 --> 01:47:57.346]  16 Russian entities, 13 Russians, 3 Russian entities have been indicted by Robert Mueller today.
[01:47:57.406 --> 01:47:58.787]  We have gotten the indictment.
[01:48:00.321 --> 01:48:11.231]  And in the indictment they are indicted for protesting against Trump and then protesting for Trump.
[01:48:12.012 --> 01:48:13.874]  So there's your takeaway headline.
[01:48:14.774 --> 01:48:16.016]  After Trump was elected
[01:48:17.597 --> 01:48:23.561]  They are reportedly then running protest against Trump and part of it... Before Trump.
[01:48:23.681 --> 01:48:24.201]  Before too.
[01:48:24.441 --> 01:48:24.681]  Yes.
[01:48:24.862 --> 01:48:25.562]  Before and after.
[01:48:25.642 --> 01:48:27.063]  I mean, I mean, this is crazy.
[01:48:27.143 --> 01:48:29.745]  It's on page 13, 20 and 25.
[01:48:29.945 --> 01:48:31.826]  So I'm going to say this again.
[01:48:32.266 --> 01:48:36.349]  The Russians that they've indicted are super low level catering companies and stuff.
[01:48:36.869 --> 01:48:38.250]  Little Facebook pages.
[01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:43.593]  They're claiming the Russians created Hillary for prison 2016, even though I created it in 2015.
[01:48:45.234 --> 01:48:47.736]  And sold right at 100,000 t-shirts.
[01:48:48.737 --> 01:49:00.725]  That came out of my brain because I saw it painted in somebody's yard on a yard sign and I said, if somebody's painting that, that is really smart.
[01:49:00.785 --> 01:49:03.908]  And I came on air and I popularized it, not the darn Russians.
[01:49:03.948 --> 01:49:05.349]  But let's just stop right there.
[01:49:05.369 --> 01:49:07.630]  I'm going to say it again if you just joined us.
[01:49:09.211 --> 01:49:13.635]  The Mueller Swamp Grand Jury Indictment
[01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:14.580]  I don't
[01:49:35.752 --> 01:49:37.614]  Trump talked about this like a year ago.
[01:49:37.654 --> 01:49:38.775]  He said, oh, we've looked at this.
[01:49:38.795 --> 01:49:42.059]  Some of these little Russian groups were actually protesting me.
[01:49:42.079 --> 01:49:45.062]  So I guess he'd gotten the intel, but I don't believe anything Mueller says.
[01:49:45.742 --> 01:49:47.584]  This just sounds like a huge cop-out of Mueller.
[01:49:47.604 --> 01:49:48.425]  What do you make of this, Owen?
[01:49:48.625 --> 01:49:49.947]  Well, I'm still trying to figure out...
[01:49:51.472 --> 01:50:17.664]  The reason for this I don't understand the reasoning behind these Russians apparently getting fake IDs fake bank accounts and then funding these Quote-unquote campaigns if you want to call it this, but yeah you had in November just after the presidential election You had this same defendants organizing a group called Trump is not my president And then that was after the election before the election you had the same defendants
[01:50:18.584 --> 01:50:25.406]  In June, creating an advertisement on Facebook promoting the saying, Support Hillary, Save American Muslims.
[01:50:25.826 --> 01:50:27.707]  And then again in July, Support Hillary.
[01:50:27.727 --> 01:50:29.347]  Sounds like, well, I mean, we know what they're doing.
[01:50:29.827 --> 01:50:30.128]  We know.
[01:50:30.568 --> 01:50:31.508]  These are entrepreneurs.
[01:50:31.528 --> 01:50:32.748]  I've looked at their profile.
[01:50:33.348 --> 01:50:39.950]  They're trying to hijack any top meme, many of which we made, to simply drive traffic to their sites.
[01:50:41.511 --> 01:50:43.351]  So there you go.
[01:50:43.432 --> 01:50:48.013]  All they're doing is opportunistically jumping on whatever's hottest from the left and the right.
[01:50:50.037 --> 01:50:51.898]  It sounds like these are just mercenaries!
[01:50:53.198 --> 01:51:04.802]  And apparently they're all over in Russia, so unless Russia is going to extradite these people to the United States, this indictment is about as useful as a roll of toilet paper.
[01:51:04.902 --> 01:51:06.183]  I'll tell you what it is, it's face-saving.
[01:51:06.503 --> 01:51:08.184]  This is just astonishing, Roger.
[01:51:08.224 --> 01:51:13.145]  I remember you last year as well, if memory serves, you're always ahead of the curve, months if not years.
[01:51:13.666 --> 01:51:14.486]  You talked about
[01:51:15.126 --> 01:51:18.110]  And I remember Corsi harped on this, and more and more he's been proven right.
[01:51:18.130 --> 01:51:20.594]  I thought he was wrong when I first hired Corsi over a year ago.
[01:51:20.614 --> 01:51:21.435]  I thought he was a good guy.
[01:51:21.915 --> 01:51:25.260]  We should get Corsi on right now, folks, or after our next guest is on with us.
[01:51:26.465 --> 01:51:30.188]  And he kept saying, Alex, there were some very small bots.
[01:51:30.248 --> 01:51:31.369]  They were working for Hillary.
[01:51:31.789 --> 01:51:35.151]  We have huge leftist groups in Russia controlled by Soros.
[01:51:35.512 --> 01:51:37.873]  This is all a very elaborate scheme to embarrass Trump.
[01:51:38.154 --> 01:51:39.314]  These are actually leftists.
[01:51:39.374 --> 01:51:42.617]  They were on both sides, but only to make it look like they were for Trump.
[01:51:42.877 --> 01:51:44.338]  They gave 3 to 1 to Hillary.
[01:51:45.239 --> 01:51:46.540]  And I'd watch a lot of RT.
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:50.543]  A lot of it was, you know, actually anti-Trump, pro-Hillary until he won the nomination.
[01:51:50.903 --> 01:51:51.924]  What do you make of this?
[01:51:51.964 --> 01:51:53.665]  This just sounds astounding, Roger Stone.
[01:51:54.522 --> 01:52:00.637]  Yeah, first of all, the size of it, you know, within the context of a multi-billion dollar presidential campaign,
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:06.043]  A couple thousand dollars worth of Facebook or Twitter posts is like urinating in the ocean.
[01:52:06.083 --> 01:52:07.104]  It has no impact at all.
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:36.202]  Mueller knows that his public credibility is waning.
[01:52:36.762 --> 01:52:37.942]  It's just about the headline.
[01:52:38.042 --> 01:52:39.523]  Mueller indicts Russians.
[01:52:39.963 --> 01:52:42.824]  Sadly, half the people in America don't read beyond that.
[01:52:43.264 --> 01:52:45.665]  They say, oh, Trump's people must have gotten into trouble.
[01:52:45.745 --> 01:52:51.407]  No, there is no connection, no coordination, no collusion with anybody surrounding Trump.
[01:52:51.807 --> 01:52:54.988]  This is half a story, but it does set a precedent.
[01:52:55.509 --> 01:53:03.292]  If Mueller is going to indict foreign nationals for interfering in our elections, when are the indictments of all the Ukrainian nationals coming?
[01:53:03.912 --> 01:53:17.217]  Lee Stranahan has come on here at InfoWars and laid out chapter and verse the collusion of the Ukrainian government to help Hillary Clinton, crimes far more egregious than what's outlined in this indictment.
[01:53:17.497 --> 01:53:18.898]  So when are they being indicted?
[01:53:19.892 --> 01:53:23.375]  You're absolutely right, and here's the headline, Russians indicted in special counsel.
[01:53:23.415 --> 01:53:23.975]  Like, see!
[01:53:24.296 --> 01:53:26.358]  They're in Russia, they're indicted!
[01:53:27.258 --> 01:53:32.583]  And it's lying on who you are on social media, lying to get visas.
[01:53:32.603 --> 01:53:35.705]  According to the Democrats, you shouldn't have to get visas.
[01:53:36.066 --> 01:53:36.706]  You just come here.
[01:53:37.327 --> 01:53:38.828]  Yeah, why are they so anti-Russian?
[01:53:38.848 --> 01:53:41.130]  Why are they so racist against Russians?
[01:53:42.751 --> 01:53:43.732]  Seems a little strange.
[01:53:44.193 --> 01:53:45.474]  Roger, where does this go from here?
[01:53:46.516 --> 01:54:00.975]  Well, the other piece of news here is, which I have not been able to confirm but reported by ABC, is that Paul Manafort associate Rick Gates has cut a plea deal and is now cooperating with Mueller.
[01:54:01.878 --> 01:54:05.700]  I still don't think that has any implications vis-a-vis Russian collusion.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:10.882]  There's no Russian collusion for Gates to testify to because there wasn't any.
[01:54:11.482 --> 01:54:16.805]  What it may do, I think it was probably designed to do, is to increase the pressure on Manafort
[01:54:17.445 --> 01:54:18.346]  We're good.
[01:54:43.619 --> 01:54:44.660]  That's not going to happen.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:46.542]  Paul Manafort's not John Dean.
[01:54:47.022 --> 01:54:51.506]  He's not going to lie to satisfy Mueller whether Gates has flipped or not.
[01:54:51.626 --> 01:54:53.547]  Now, I don't know Gates.
[01:54:53.968 --> 01:54:56.810]  He was never an associate at the old Black Manafort & Stone.
[01:54:56.850 --> 01:55:01.594]  He joined Manafort long after Manafort and I had split as business partners.
[01:55:02.575 --> 01:55:02.755]  Sure.
[01:55:02.815 --> 01:55:10.925]  Well, let's talk about something in a private conversation we had two weeks ago, and you said you were ready to talk about it yesterday in studio, but we never got to it.
[01:55:10.945 --> 01:55:11.285]  You said that
[01:55:20.299 --> 01:55:22.642]  From your intel, Bannon's always been a double agent.
[01:55:22.662 --> 01:55:24.383]  You weren't sure of it until the middle of last year.
[01:55:24.423 --> 01:55:25.064]  You warned me.
[01:55:25.084 --> 01:55:25.965]  That was on record.
[01:55:26.005 --> 01:55:27.126]  I didn't want to go with it on air.
[01:55:27.446 --> 01:55:29.489]  I've apologized to you and everybody else for that.
[01:55:29.509 --> 01:55:32.131]  It was a mistake I made just trying to be such a team player.
[01:55:32.151 --> 01:55:35.895]  You can't be on the team with somebody that's a Benedict Arnold or Judas Iscariot.
[01:55:36.816 --> 01:55:40.300]  And so that's a big, big, big, big loss we have thanks to me and others.
[01:55:43.042 --> 01:55:48.805]  But you said he's clearly working with Mueller, even though he wasn't ever involved in the campaign during when all this Russia crap went on.
[01:55:48.885 --> 01:55:55.588]  Now it's admitted, it's in the news today, that now Bannon's going to be the star witness to move forward and basically Mueller's only hope.
[01:55:55.988 --> 01:55:58.049]  You predicted this, you've got intel.
[01:55:58.109 --> 01:56:01.390]  What is it when we come back in about two minutes, half of this break?
[01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:04.171]  And then we've got Quentin Tarantino's father coming on.
[01:56:04.191 --> 01:56:06.132]  I'm not a gossip columnist, but he is his father.
[01:56:06.152 --> 01:56:09.194]  And Quentin Tarantino has been promoting basically pedophilia.
[01:56:10.174 --> 01:56:16.502]  And so his father contacted us and laid some incredible info on us that fits in with everything we already know.
[01:56:20.257 --> 01:56:21.878]  So we're going to go there, okay?
[01:56:22.179 --> 01:56:32.107]  And we're going to go there, Mr. Tarantino, with his father to understand exactly why he goes on Howard Stern and says sex with children is okay if they're consenting.
[01:56:32.447 --> 01:56:34.228]  That is the Nambla Creed.
[01:56:34.829 --> 01:56:42.395]  So we're going to cover that coming up for about 30 minutes and then continue with phone calls from folks here on this Friday edition.
[01:56:43.015 --> 01:56:44.577]  Just briefly, we are ending
[01:56:46.525 --> 01:56:53.710]  Four sales, either Sunday or Monday, because I have a new special starting on Tuesday, and supplies are running low.
[01:56:53.730 --> 01:56:59.154]  50% off the liver and kidney cleanse Icarin.
[01:56:59.674 --> 01:57:00.415]  Go read about it.
[01:57:00.535 --> 01:57:01.235]  It's amazing.
[01:57:01.295 --> 01:57:02.416]  You cannot beat it.
[01:57:02.556 --> 01:57:06.679]  It's the best herbs and compounds that are known to, in a healthy way, flush that out.
[01:57:06.759 --> 01:57:07.499]  It is dramatic.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.161]  You owe it to yourself, your family, you name it.
[01:57:10.276 --> 01:57:10.897]  It's amazing.
[01:57:10.997 --> 01:57:12.078]  Ikra and 50% Off.
[01:57:12.418 --> 01:57:20.945]  We also have the DNA Force Plus, but in our first run it's called Cell Force Plus because I didn't want to get into a trademark issue with one of our partners.
[01:57:20.965 --> 01:57:26.209]  They said, no, this is so good, so much stronger, so much better, and so much lower price, you can call it DNA Force Plus.
[01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:30.973]  We're going to call it that when it comes out soon, but it's a third of the price you'd ever find anybody else with it.
[01:57:31.474 --> 01:57:34.096]  The CoQ10, the BioQQQ, that is about to sell out.
[01:57:34.496 --> 01:57:35.577]  So that is a discount of 50%.
[01:57:35.737 --> 01:57:43.779]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:58:00.598 --> 01:58:02.400]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:09.567]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:58:09.988 --> 01:58:15.753]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:58:16.454 --> 01:58:37.427]  Our ancestors knew work, so let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:58:38.508 --> 01:58:42.651]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:58:42.971 --> 01:58:48.274]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[01:58:48.634 --> 01:58:49.695]  As above, so below.
[01:58:50.255 --> 01:58:53.077]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[01:58:53.957 --> 01:58:55.058]  Most tiny of scales.
[01:58:55.558 --> 01:58:56.639]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:58:57.079 --> 01:58:58.560]  America is building its wall.
[01:58:58.961 --> 01:58:59.441]  Will it work?
[01:58:59.561 --> 01:59:00.061]  We don't know.
[01:59:00.562 --> 01:59:01.162]  Is Trump right?
[01:59:01.843 --> 01:59:03.964]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:59:04.464 --> 01:59:10.428]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[01:59:10.809 --> 01:59:16.693]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:59:17.433 --> 01:59:23.735]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:59:24.475 --> 01:59:27.916]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[01:59:28.176 --> 01:59:39.480]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:42.521]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[01:59:43.181 --> 01:59:46.403]  You will get a mean wall and other great products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:59:46.743 --> 01:59:50.465]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:59:52.886 --> 01:59:56.988]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:57.528 --> 01:59:58.809]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.536 --> 02:00:12.561]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[02:00:12.942 --> 02:00:16.827]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:24.415 --> 02:00:32.987]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.348 --> 02:00:36.652]  And Owen Schroer, and of course, Roger Stone.
[02:00:37.373 --> 02:00:40.978]  So, we're not trying to just strafe Bannon and some ego thing.
[02:00:41.719 --> 02:00:43.320]  We wanted to believe in him as this great man.
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:52.143]  He was really just a Hollywood screenwriter that took our liberty movement, my words especially, and others and twisted it into a conflagration to try to gain control.
[02:00:52.203 --> 02:00:53.723]  But Drudge and others smelled him out.
[02:00:54.104 --> 02:00:54.864]  You smelled him out.
[02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:59.509]  You're not a backbiter and fighter like me, so you didn't mess with him.
[02:00:59.529 --> 02:01:02.310]  But now, they're calling him the next Golden Boy.
[02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:13.794]  This whole fake Russia indictment thing of a ham sandwich and people that were actually attacking Trump, their own indictment admits, just bizarre, of low-level nobodies.
[02:01:14.054 --> 02:01:16.294]  Does this signal a face-saving end?
[02:01:16.834 --> 02:01:24.817]  Or, as we're seeing in the news, is the man riding in on the white horse, as the cavalry, as the Deus Ex, going to be Little Baby Bannon?
[02:01:27.065 --> 02:01:29.567]  Well, let me take this and break it down in two parts, Alex.
[02:01:29.588 --> 02:01:38.096]  First of all, I think one of the main reasons that Mueller popped this out today is because the indictment of General Mike Flynn is falling apart before his very eyes.
[02:01:38.934 --> 02:01:49.140]  Mueller agreed to a stipulation for a protected order, a protective order on the evidence surrounding Flynn's indictment, which is looking flimsier and flimsier.
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.603]  I think there's a high probability that the charges against Flynn are going to get vacated.
[02:01:54.923 --> 02:01:58.365]  And the judge in that case just recused himself, and a new judge is in there too.
[02:01:58.385 --> 02:01:59.686]  That's also significant, Roger.
[02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:00.787]  Exactly.
[02:02:00.867 --> 02:02:08.955]  So, I mean, I think there's good news for that great American patriot, Mike Flynn, who I think was unfairly terminated and unjustly indicted.
[02:02:09.156 --> 02:02:10.037]  He was the linchpin.
[02:02:10.077 --> 02:02:11.558]  He was the first domino to fall.
[02:02:12.379 --> 02:02:12.960]  No question.
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:16.543]  And that opened the doors for the globalists, for H.R.
[02:02:16.564 --> 02:02:21.489]  McMaster and General John Kelly and others to get back inside the tent.
[02:02:22.442 --> 02:02:34.094]  As far as Mueller's, pardon me, as far as Bannon is concerned, my understanding is that he is now singing like a canary, and he is attempting to impugn the president on business-related things.
[02:02:34.635 --> 02:02:36.697]  It's not, it's not me too.
[02:02:37.438 --> 02:02:43.144]  There's some speculation about that, that he may have tall tales to tell about Donald Trump and women.
[02:02:44.045 --> 02:02:45.106]  It's not that at all.
[02:02:45.666 --> 02:02:56.597]  I think the allegation is going to be that the president was trying to do personal business when he was, you know, had allegedly, according to Bannon, recused himself from his business.
[02:02:56.697 --> 02:02:59.440]  Now, my guess is most of this is trumped up.
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:02.143]  The president's way too smart for that.
[02:03:02.163 --> 02:03:06.888]  Plus, if you actually read Presidential Power, you're allowed to keep doing your private business as president.
[02:03:08.084 --> 02:03:11.406]  Well, I mean, look, Bannon is like a spurned lover, you know?
[02:03:11.426 --> 02:03:15.828]  He's like a scorned, scorned, bloated, tart whore.
[02:03:16.968 --> 02:03:18.489]  You know, who dresses out of a dumpster.
[02:03:19.867 --> 02:03:21.108]  He looks like a psychotic.
[02:03:22.449 --> 02:03:24.330]  And who needs to be introduced as open water.
[02:03:25.091 --> 02:03:31.656]  No, look, this is, it's very strange because the president gave this guy the highest possible honor you can have in our business.
[02:03:32.456 --> 02:03:36.779]  I mean, a White House job is, is, is, that's the pinnacle of success.
[02:03:36.879 --> 02:03:41.623]  And he made him chief strategist and then he proceeded to leak all over it and crap all over it.
[02:03:42.168 --> 02:03:42.549]  Delusions!
[02:03:42.569 --> 02:03:43.450]  It was only two, Roger.
[02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:44.091]  Come on.
[02:03:44.111 --> 02:03:45.855]  I've seen him wear three!
[02:03:56.374 --> 02:04:00.758]  You know what's going to be incredible?
[02:04:00.918 --> 02:04:06.563]  Well now CNN puts different pictures of Steve Bannon up when they talk about him because he's the good guy now.
[02:04:06.583 --> 02:04:08.925]  So they have like a photoshopped picture of Steve Bannon they use.
[02:04:09.405 --> 02:04:20.795]  But I tell you what's going to be shocking about this is this is the tripling quadrupling down of the Trump-Russia collusion delusion and the brainwashed minions out there are only getting more crazier.
[02:04:20.835 --> 02:04:21.515]  I mean this is
[02:04:22.316 --> 02:04:23.037]  They're going to buy this.
[02:04:23.197 --> 02:04:24.198]  That's going to be the craziest thing.
[02:04:24.218 --> 02:04:27.803]  They're going to buy this, they're going to celebrate this, and they're going to act like this is a big victory for them.
[02:04:28.297 --> 02:04:31.658]  Meanwhile, the President's on his way to the hospital in Broward County.
[02:04:31.678 --> 02:04:33.179]  Which they're also mocking him for.
[02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.140]  They're literally mocking him for that on Twitter.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.641]  Ana Navarro and them are mocking the President for going to Florida.
[02:04:38.921 --> 02:04:44.843]  Or they'll just do like some of the CNN reporters, they'll just say he never really went to the hospital.
[02:04:45.104 --> 02:04:46.024]  He didn't do anything.
[02:04:46.044 --> 02:04:46.784]  It was Acosta.
[02:04:46.884 --> 02:04:47.484]  He was never there.
[02:04:47.524 --> 02:04:49.445]  He didn't go see Scalise.
[02:04:49.505 --> 02:04:50.526]  No, he was never in Florida.
[02:04:50.806 --> 02:04:52.907]  And they took the bust out of Martin Luther King.
[02:04:54.368 --> 02:04:55.110]  Hey, thanks Roger.
[02:04:55.130 --> 02:04:56.274]  He colluded with Russia too.
[02:04:56.314 --> 02:04:56.936]  We found him now.
[02:04:56.956 --> 02:04:58.701]  We'll be back with Quentin Tarantino's father.
[02:05:01.152 --> 02:05:05.875]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globals, but they're striking back all over the world.
[02:05:06.155 --> 02:05:11.679]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[02:05:11.799 --> 02:05:20.825]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[02:05:21.005 --> 02:05:28.830]  So go to FortifiedSupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[02:05:28.911 --> 02:05:30.892]  That's FortifiedSupply.com.
[02:05:31.572 --> 02:05:38.796]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:53.823]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[02:05:54.103 --> 02:05:56.944]  It also funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[02:05:57.365 --> 02:05:59.986]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:14.626 --> 02:06:17.106]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:17.226 --> 02:06:19.906]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.567 --> 02:06:28.368]  People should not be afraid of their governments.
[02:06:28.748 --> 02:06:30.948]  Governments should be afraid
[02:07:00.685 --> 02:07:05.262]  Several party members have been murdered, Chief Inspector.
[02:07:11.733 --> 02:07:16.114]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[02:07:16.194 --> 02:07:18.675]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[02:07:19.235 --> 02:07:20.775]  It just pancaked.
[02:07:21.236 --> 02:07:25.157]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[02:07:25.257 --> 02:07:27.977]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[02:07:28.037 --> 02:07:32.299]  The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.
[02:07:32.359 --> 02:07:37.140]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:41.741]  This is shock and awe, Tom, to the population of Baghdad.
[02:07:42.662 --> 02:07:44.382]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[02:07:44.842 --> 02:07:50.324]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[02:07:50.844 --> 02:07:53.825]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:07:54.226 --> 02:07:54.746]  Come on!
[02:07:57.007 --> 02:07:58.407]  It is a big idea.
[02:07:58.987 --> 02:08:00.048]  A new world order.
[02:08:00.268 --> 02:08:01.028]  I love my dad.
[02:08:02.245 --> 02:08:03.106]  I'd kill for him.
[02:08:03.266 --> 02:08:05.487]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[02:08:05.647 --> 02:08:06.648]  I love Bill Clinton.
[02:08:06.708 --> 02:08:09.070]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[02:08:09.850 --> 02:08:10.651]  My sister-in-law.
[02:08:10.751 --> 02:08:16.415]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[02:08:16.455 --> 02:08:17.996]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[02:08:18.914 --> 02:08:19.695]  I think he's a traitor.
[02:08:19.975 --> 02:08:21.796]  Obama is the one that kills the U.S.
[02:08:21.836 --> 02:08:23.738]  troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[02:08:23.758 --> 02:08:25.459]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[02:08:25.619 --> 02:08:27.881]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[02:08:28.061 --> 02:08:32.304]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[02:08:32.384 --> 02:08:33.385]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:34.686]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:08:34.966 --> 02:08:35.846]  This isn't a game!
[02:08:40.444 --> 02:08:41.765]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[02:08:41.805 --> 02:08:42.926]  This is what we do!
[02:08:43.146 --> 02:08:43.586]  Woo!
[02:08:44.587 --> 02:08:47.529]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[02:08:47.649 --> 02:08:49.330]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:50.971]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[02:08:51.111 --> 02:08:59.657]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[02:08:59.957 --> 02:09:01.538]  In 2012, the U.S.
[02:09:01.578 --> 02:09:04.340]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:05.661]  Why did you not stop that?
[02:09:05.701 --> 02:09:07.082]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[02:09:07.382 --> 02:09:08.463]  What were you waiting for?
[02:09:08.783 --> 02:09:10.104]  Oh, for you, Inspector.
[02:09:11.084 --> 02:09:11.844]  I needed you.
[02:09:18.486 --> 02:09:21.787]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[02:09:21.907 --> 02:09:28.309]  We're all part of it.
[02:09:28.329 --> 02:09:29.409]  Are we ready for it?
[02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:36.491]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:09:40.657 --> 02:09:45.442]  We're going to be joined until about 45 after by Tony Tarantino.
[02:09:46.063 --> 02:09:47.485]  Tarantinoproductions.com.
[02:09:47.985 --> 02:09:51.369]  He got into acting, producing, directing, I guess before his son was even born.
[02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:53.832]  And we got this call about a week and a half ago.
[02:09:53.952 --> 02:09:54.653]  I looked into it.
[02:09:54.713 --> 02:09:55.273]  I vetted it.
[02:09:55.293 --> 02:09:56.034]  I made some calls.
[02:09:57.175 --> 02:10:00.219]  And he's a really interesting person.
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:04.501]  The Tarantino family has for over 80 years in the film industry.
[02:10:04.942 --> 02:10:16.587]  Tarantino Productions was established in 1958 as a general partnership between Dominic Tarantino and Tony Tarantino in 2017 for the first time since the founding of Tarantino Productions LLC.
[02:10:16.847 --> 02:10:21.169]  Tony Tarantino decided to bring his son Edward J. Tarantino in as vice president.
[02:10:21.649 --> 02:10:25.331]  Tarantino Productions participates in the writing of screenplays and scripts.
[02:10:26.071 --> 02:10:26.832]  Uh, and it just goes on.
[02:10:26.912 --> 02:10:28.393]  He had a very interesting background in history.
[02:10:28.413 --> 02:10:29.054]  He's a patriot.
[02:10:29.074 --> 02:10:29.755]  He's a conservative.
[02:10:30.055 --> 02:10:35.960]  I'll let him stay a few minutes about his background and patriotism, but I got the contact.
[02:10:36.966 --> 02:10:42.127]  And I was like, this is Tarantino's dad, and he says that he really is upset about what Clinton's saying.
[02:10:43.067 --> 02:10:46.748]  And my issue was, he's defended Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, Clinton has.
[02:10:48.108 --> 02:10:51.709]  Clinton, for no reason, first time I ever saw him, came over and told me to get the F out of here.
[02:10:51.729 --> 02:10:54.650]  And I was at a public movie theater watching The Friends Connection.
[02:10:54.670 --> 02:10:56.010]  I didn't know he was going to show up and speak.
[02:10:56.050 --> 02:10:57.230]  I knew the director was going to be there.
[02:10:57.651 --> 02:11:02.552]  And then he was there, and it was his event, and some of the people attached to him came over.
[02:11:04.532 --> 02:11:05.933]  We're good to go.
[02:11:25.515 --> 02:11:29.276]  That when it was a big national controversy that, well, it was consenting.
[02:11:29.316 --> 02:11:34.778]  Well, no, you can't pick up my 13-year-old daughter and you convince her to have sex with you because you drug her, that it's consenting.
[02:11:34.858 --> 02:11:36.739]  It's below the age of consent.
[02:11:36.779 --> 02:11:38.199]  That is a nambulous statement.
[02:11:38.939 --> 02:11:41.260]  And I don't want to just, I feel bad with his father here.
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:45.762]  I've looked up, that's a good record and everything, but his dad wanted to come on to set the record straight about the family.
[02:11:46.062 --> 02:11:50.643]  We'll play that clip if you missed it from Howard Stern, but even Howard Stern gave him like, it goes on for like an hour.
[02:11:50.683 --> 02:11:51.803]  Like, dude, back off.
[02:11:51.903 --> 02:11:53.004]  You know, say you're joking.
[02:11:53.664 --> 02:11:56.267]  And Tarantino, Clinton, would not say that.
[02:11:56.307 --> 02:12:08.478]  And then we learned, talking to his father, and I don't know how much we want to get into on air, but it fits the MO of why somebody would think something like that if they themselves had been abused.
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:16.165]  So, this rabbit hole goes deep, but Epstein's plane, Aletha Express,
[02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:21.093]  And, of course, Weinstein on board, the Clintons on board.
[02:12:21.213 --> 02:12:23.615]  I mean, this is a big house of cards.
[02:12:24.656 --> 02:12:27.378]  And why would Tarantino publicly defend that?
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.941]  And why would the media refuse to pick it up?
[02:12:31.262 --> 02:12:34.965]  I mean, if a guy slaps his wife, he gets in trouble, and he should.
[02:12:35.345 --> 02:12:38.187]  Or if somebody slaps a girl in the butt, they get fired.
[02:12:39.208 --> 02:12:40.109]  And they should get in trouble.
[02:12:41.150 --> 02:12:46.074]  But when it's, hey, it's okay for men to drug 13-year-olds and rape them in the butt,
[02:12:47.335 --> 02:12:50.537]  Excuse my French, it's okay if Quentin Tarantino says it.
[02:12:50.577 --> 02:13:05.268]  So, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes and come back with the Stern clips, but Tony Tarantino, I know it's probably hard for you to come on and talk about this, but why did you reach out to us and say, for the family name that was in your first email, you wanted to come on and make a statement about this?
[02:13:06.771 --> 02:13:10.453]  That's really important to me, Alex.
[02:13:10.893 --> 02:13:13.915]  You know, my dad was everything to me.
[02:13:13.995 --> 02:13:15.176]  He was my hero.
[02:13:15.356 --> 02:13:18.517]  My dad was an actor in the early 30s.
[02:13:18.577 --> 02:13:22.219]  He did films with Tom Nix, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy.
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:26.822]  That picture of him that you just showed is on Tom Nix's horse, Tony.
[02:13:27.674 --> 02:13:28.774]  You know, he was an actor.
[02:13:28.894 --> 02:13:29.955]  I had to be an actor.
[02:13:30.135 --> 02:13:32.516]  My dad was a World War II Marine.
[02:13:32.576 --> 02:13:34.837]  He served in Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima.
[02:13:35.297 --> 02:13:36.417]  I had to be a Marine.
[02:13:36.797 --> 02:13:40.358]  The Tarantino name has integrity.
[02:13:40.599 --> 02:13:41.479]  It has respect.
[02:13:41.539 --> 02:13:44.520]  And what Quentin has been doing with it just sickens me.
[02:13:45.260 --> 02:13:45.501]  Yeah.
[02:14:08.635 --> 02:14:14.699]  So you're marines, you're police, you're patriots, and you're pissed that your son is pissing all over it?
[02:14:25.737 --> 02:14:26.757]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:14:26.898 --> 02:14:27.418]  Exactly.
[02:14:27.478 --> 02:14:32.380]  And then here's another point that I make to me that's important.
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:39.403]  He really has no technical or legal right to the name Tarantino.
[02:14:40.163 --> 02:14:49.127]  When he was between two and a half and three years old, his mother remarried and her new husband, Zastapil, adopted Quentin.
[02:14:49.427 --> 02:14:52.629]  So his legal name is Quentin Jerome Zastapil.
[02:14:53.429 --> 02:14:57.552]  He went all through school and everything he did as Zastapil.
[02:14:58.152 --> 02:15:07.698]  Then when he decided he wanted to get into the film industry, he decided to jump on the Tarantino name that already had some recognition in the industry.
[02:15:09.059 --> 02:15:12.501]  And one thing, he made a public statement once and he says,
[02:15:14.328 --> 02:15:21.231]  My dad, or Tony Tarantino, wanted to be an actor, and until he took my name, now he's an actor.
[02:15:21.531 --> 02:15:23.332]  This is so sick.
[02:15:23.472 --> 02:15:28.734]  My first film that I was ever in was Where the Boys Are in 1958, five years before he was
[02:15:30.414 --> 02:15:34.698]  No, I know, your IMDB is huge, your dad's IMDB is huge as well.
[02:15:35.519 --> 02:15:38.081]  So it just shows the total upside down world.
[02:15:38.381 --> 02:15:42.465]  Talk about a three-barreled name, that sounds like some British royalty name he got.
[02:15:42.545 --> 02:15:46.969]  He ought to keep his adopted little British royalty name instead of a cool name like Tarantino.
[02:15:47.549 --> 02:15:51.293]  If he had a more American sounding name like Rocky Tarantino, I wouldn't mess with that guy.
[02:15:51.713 --> 02:15:55.034]  We'll be right back with Tony Tarantino straight ahead.
[02:15:55.454 --> 02:16:00.195]  I'm Alex Jones and we're going to set the record straight with his father about why he's promoting stuff.
[02:16:00.576 --> 02:16:04.457]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:16:04.997 --> 02:16:12.399]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:16:13.099 --> 02:16:17.823]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:16:18.424 --> 02:16:20.345]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:16:20.946 --> 02:16:24.389]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:16:25.190 --> 02:16:27.652]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:16:28.332 --> 02:16:34.976]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:16:35.596 --> 02:16:42.820]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:16:43.681 --> 02:16:50.345]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:16:50.905 --> 02:16:52.006]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:16:52.386 --> 02:16:54.187]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:16:55.008 --> 02:16:57.956]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:16:58.497 --> 02:17:00.222]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:17:02.208 --> 02:17:06.652]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:17:06.872 --> 02:17:11.576]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:17:12.177 --> 02:17:18.021]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[02:17:18.542 --> 02:17:31.053]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:17:31.793 --> 02:17:33.355]  Unlike other systems.
[02:17:33.415 --> 02:17:38.900]  I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:40.501]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:17:40.521 --> 02:17:42.383]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:17:42.723 --> 02:17:43.904]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:17:44.045 --> 02:17:45.146]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:17:45.326 --> 02:17:46.527]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:17:46.727 --> 02:17:48.207]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:17:48.727 --> 02:17:50.328]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:17:50.348 --> 02:17:52.128]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:17:52.468 --> 02:17:55.089]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT science, this and everything else.
[02:17:55.129 --> 02:17:55.989]  This is insane.
[02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:58.009]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:17:58.269 --> 02:18:00.830]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:02.790]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:04.651]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:18:04.671 --> 02:18:06.531]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:18:07.411 --> 02:18:13.313]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:18:13.573 --> 02:18:14.913]  All just moderate dose.
[02:18:16.445 --> 02:18:24.437]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:18:24.457 --> 02:18:26.860]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.042]  But thank you for committing.
[02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:34.923]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:18:35.303 --> 02:18:37.905]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:18:37.925 --> 02:18:42.690]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:18:43.170 --> 02:18:49.295]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:18:49.315 --> 02:18:52.418]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:18:52.778 --> 02:18:54.100]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:19:03.899 --> 02:19:05.320]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:06.801]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:19:06.881 --> 02:19:07.222]  Go ahead.
[02:19:07.342 --> 02:19:07.622]  Yes.
[02:19:08.062 --> 02:19:08.763]  Hi, Alex.
[02:19:08.883 --> 02:19:15.088]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:19:15.288 --> 02:19:19.271]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:19:19.512 --> 02:19:20.953]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:19:21.333 --> 02:19:28.039]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:19:28.099 --> 02:19:30.881]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:19:31.842 --> 02:19:36.545]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:19:36.585 --> 02:19:44.411]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:19:44.431 --> 02:19:50.235]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:19:50.395 --> 02:19:55.699]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:19:55.779 --> 02:19:58.781]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:20:04.008 --> 02:20:18.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:19.017 --> 02:20:24.000]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:26.622]  You're listening to Alex Jones!
[02:20:29.321 --> 02:20:31.883]  Coming up, the video's on Infowars.com.
[02:20:31.903 --> 02:20:39.589]  The father, looks like Kevin Costner, leftist bully, father of Florida shooting victim for supporting Trump.
[02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:41.051]  I don't feel sorry for him.
[02:20:41.071 --> 02:20:42.212]  F Trump.
[02:20:43.793 --> 02:20:45.975]  And so that video's on Infowars.com.
[02:20:45.995 --> 02:20:47.676]  It's a Kellan McBreen article.
[02:20:47.936 --> 02:20:49.197]  We're gonna be covering it coming up.
[02:20:49.778 --> 02:20:54.822]  Now, Tony Tarantino, the confirmed, admitted father of Quentin Tarantino, one of the biggest directors in Hollywood,
[02:20:56.124 --> 02:20:56.665]  He's our guest.
[02:20:56.685 --> 02:20:57.846]  He has Tarantino Productions.
[02:20:57.886 --> 02:20:59.787]  His dad was a World War II veteran.
[02:21:00.648 --> 02:21:01.849]  He was a Marine.
[02:21:01.889 --> 02:21:04.432]  He himself is a patriot.
[02:21:04.452 --> 02:21:09.156]  And he's on record in hundreds of films, directing, TV shows, movies, you name it.
[02:21:09.977 --> 02:21:11.558]  And so he's Quentin Tarantino's dad.
[02:21:11.598 --> 02:21:14.181]  And I just got up there and pointed out
[02:21:15.334 --> 02:21:23.757]  I guess early last week, if you just tuned in, the media ignores reports of pedophilia, men and women being raped.
[02:21:24.537 --> 02:21:32.159]  I'm not against gay people in general, but there is a, quote, gay mafia, gay Hollywood folks have said, where men get abused and then no one speaks up for them.
[02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:44.444]  There's been a lot of reports about Tarantino and others spitting on women, making them wreck cars, do dangerous stunts, all sorts of sexual assault by Weinstein being covered up, rape, you name it.
[02:21:45.124 --> 02:21:48.785]  And the media leaves Tarantino alone for some reason.
[02:21:49.545 --> 02:21:51.286]  And so that's a big question for his father.
[02:21:51.386 --> 02:21:52.206]  Why do they leave him alone?
[02:21:52.266 --> 02:22:02.610]  And why would Clinton go on Howard Stern and say in the middle of a firestorm about Roman Polanski that, you know, had a girl he grabbed, drugged, raped,
[02:22:04.355 --> 02:22:05.758]  Why would he say it's consensual?
[02:22:05.798 --> 02:22:07.741]  That's Nambla-type talk.
[02:22:08.363 --> 02:22:11.388]  It wasn't consensual, plus it can't be legally because he's not the age of consent.
[02:22:12.330 --> 02:22:16.972]  So, it's why a 12-year-old can't get breast implants or have a sex change.
[02:22:17.032 --> 02:22:24.035]  I mean, it's the same thing, but the left wants to lower the age of consent so they can come in, tell parents not to be parents, they come in and take control of your children.
[02:22:24.416 --> 02:22:25.356]  That's the program.
[02:22:25.776 --> 02:22:34.060]  So, he joins us now, but I want to play a clip of this so he can respond to it, of Quentin Tarantino, his son, on Howard Stern.
[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:37.702]  When you, Gary Garver, our reporter out in Hollywood, interviewed you.
[02:22:39.877 --> 02:22:42.578]  Here's what you said, I gotta ask you about this.
[02:22:42.618 --> 02:22:43.499]  This I don't understand.
[02:22:43.639 --> 02:22:44.979]  Your movie I understand, this I don't.
[02:22:45.099 --> 02:22:45.419]  You ready?
[02:22:45.579 --> 02:22:45.739]  Yeah.
[02:22:45.819 --> 02:22:46.520]  Okay, here we go.
[02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:47.900]  Hey Quentin, how you doing man?
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:48.901]  Hey, how's it going man?
[02:22:48.921 --> 02:22:49.361]  Pretty good.
[02:22:49.381 --> 02:22:50.561]  Nice to meet you.
[02:22:50.942 --> 02:22:52.482]  What have you done to make the world a better place?
[02:22:53.162 --> 02:22:55.023]  I don't know, what do you think I've done?
[02:22:55.043 --> 02:22:56.444]  Cool movies.
[02:22:56.784 --> 02:22:58.444]  Oh, well, I'll stand with that.
[02:22:58.765 --> 02:22:59.305]  Fiction's awesome.
[02:22:59.325 --> 02:22:59.685]  Yeah.
[02:23:00.585 --> 02:23:02.686]  You happy when Rowan Pulaski won the Oscar?
[02:23:03.246 --> 02:23:04.547]  Yeah, that was pretty cool actually, yeah.
[02:23:06.197 --> 02:23:09.101]  What's so great about a rapist being the recipient of Hollywood's highest honor?
[02:23:10.243 --> 02:23:13.467]  I don't consider him a rapist.
[02:23:13.968 --> 02:23:16.331]  How can you defend... See, I don't understand this.
[02:23:16.512 --> 02:23:17.874]  How come Hollywood embraces...
[02:23:18.835 --> 02:23:22.217]  This madman, this director, who raped a 13-year-old.
[02:23:22.857 --> 02:23:24.158]  He didn't rape a 13-year-old.
[02:23:24.198 --> 02:23:25.318]  It was statutory rape.
[02:23:25.438 --> 02:23:26.179]  Yeah, all right.
[02:23:26.239 --> 02:23:28.560]  Well, that's not quite the same thing.
[02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:31.061]  Come on!
[02:23:31.241 --> 02:23:32.522]  It's not statutory rape.
[02:23:32.562 --> 02:23:34.663]  You know, he had sex with a minor.
[02:23:34.963 --> 02:23:35.223]  All right?
[02:23:35.263 --> 02:23:36.024]  That's not rape.
[02:23:36.184 --> 02:23:40.366]  To me, when you use the word rape, all right, you're talking about violent throwing them down.
[02:23:40.426 --> 02:23:41.947]  It's like one of the most violent crimes in the world.
[02:23:41.967 --> 02:23:42.427]  You can't throw
[02:23:42.987 --> 02:23:46.428]  You know, throwing the word rape around is like throwing the word racist around, alright?
[02:23:46.448 --> 02:23:49.449]  You know, it just doesn't apply to everything that people use it for, alright?
[02:23:49.809 --> 02:23:52.630]  You know, he was guilty of having sex with a minor.
[02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:54.131]  That she didn't want to have?
[02:23:54.251 --> 02:23:55.711]  No, that was not the case at all!
[02:23:55.771 --> 02:24:09.795]  She wanted to have it, and dated the guy, and found out, and by the way, we're talking about America's morals, we're not talking about the morals in Europe and everything, alright?
[02:24:11.616 --> 02:24:13.657]  So the argument is, it's consensual.
[02:24:14.618 --> 02:24:18.179]  But she was drugged and taken there by a woman, and none of this is even true.
[02:24:18.219 --> 02:24:19.340]  And it's in the police report.
[02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:22.181]  But he's going with the Hollywood story, though.
[02:24:22.201 --> 02:24:25.803]  He's dating, yeah, a 40-something-year-old man, a 13-year-old girl.
[02:24:26.503 --> 02:24:28.844]  And then, you know, she's bleeding all over the place.
[02:24:29.385 --> 02:24:37.209]  And then they sell this while they're saying men and women together is bad, and Me Too movement trying to break up families.
[02:24:37.929 --> 02:24:39.430]  Then, but pedophilia is okay.
[02:24:40.690 --> 02:24:51.779]  I know you talk to the producer quite a bit, sir, and we'll come back in a long segment coming up, but hearing that, generally either people are predators or they've been preyed on when they think like that.
[02:24:52.139 --> 02:24:58.184]  Nambla's argument is they should be able to come to your door or my door and go, you got a five-year-old daughter, ten-year-old daughter, son, whatever.
[02:24:58.244 --> 02:25:05.909]  If they want to go on a date with me, the UN is even looking at trying to make this world law that if the child wants to go, they're emancipated, they go.
[02:25:06.803 --> 02:25:11.047]  They want to go on a sailing ship with, you know, 100 Somalis and, you know, it's up to them.
[02:25:11.067 --> 02:25:12.829]  I mean, no more parental rights.
[02:25:12.869 --> 02:25:14.310]  Your kid wants a vaccine, they get it.
[02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:16.772]  Your kid wants to watch, take drugs, they do it.
[02:25:17.213 --> 02:25:20.055]  This is an attack on parenthood, parental rights, obviously.
[02:25:20.075 --> 02:25:27.682]  But I mean, what, as Quentin Tarantino's father, and him hanging out with Weinstein and all this, and all the new controversies, what do you make of this, sir?
[02:25:28.863 --> 02:25:32.106]  Well, you know, one, it totally infuriates me.
[02:25:33.357 --> 02:25:44.643]  Me or you, as an adult male, take an adult female out and get her stoned out of her head on alcohol, then take her to a room and have sex with her.
[02:25:44.663 --> 02:25:45.343]  That's rape.
[02:25:46.604 --> 02:25:47.905]  You get charged with it.
[02:25:47.945 --> 02:25:48.845]  That's illegal.
[02:25:48.865 --> 02:25:58.810]  Look at all the cases that have come out with things like that about men just getting a woman intoxicated, then taking advantage of her.
[02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:59.491]  That's rape.
[02:25:59.971 --> 02:26:01.171]  Now you take a 13-year-old
[02:26:02.752 --> 02:26:11.201]  I mean, God, I wouldn't care if this 13-year-old was the most beautiful female on the face of the earth and she comes up and says, I want you.
[02:26:11.562 --> 02:26:18.409]  You've got to be plum out of your ever-loving mind to even think about taking advantage of something like that.
[02:26:19.139 --> 02:26:28.428]  Uh, you know, I've got three books right here behind me, written on Quentin Tarantino, and I'm quoting you some of the things he said, and they're in these books.
[02:26:28.968 --> 02:26:40.079]  One thing that he said is that when he was a kid, 11, 12 years old, his mother used to take him to the Pussycat Theatres and sit there and watch foreign films with him.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:41.160]  Wow.
[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:44.063]  Now, that's a statement he made, and it's in one of these books.
[02:26:45.706 --> 02:26:48.430]  Uh, yeah, you know, it's sick.
[02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:49.872]  It really is.
[02:26:50.152 --> 02:26:52.615]  There's no excuse for it.
[02:26:53.016 --> 02:26:57.162]  Quentin, I gotta say, is a filmmaking genius.
[02:26:57.222 --> 02:26:59.064]  He's done some phenomenal work.
[02:26:59.761 --> 02:27:06.246]  But on the other hand, he's such an egotistical maniac that thinks he's above everything else.
[02:27:06.566 --> 02:27:10.770]  He sits on $150 million of his own capital.
[02:27:11.050 --> 02:27:13.012]  He could afford to do anything he likes.
[02:27:13.552 --> 02:27:19.737]  Right now, Sony is threatening to drop his new film on the Manson family.
[02:27:20.450 --> 02:27:24.932]  That's been all over the social media.
[02:27:25.032 --> 02:27:25.612]  I've seen it.
[02:27:25.632 --> 02:27:28.173]  Well that's my next question.
[02:27:28.233 --> 02:27:36.276]  He's into, he introduced everybody, Pulp Fiction, men raping men, torture, now the Manson Family, Satanism, Helter Skelter.
[02:27:36.676 --> 02:27:38.357]  He's being used as a conduit
[02:27:38.837 --> 02:27:42.079]  It sounds to me too, but I couldn't verify that because I don't know.
[02:28:05.551 --> 02:28:09.095]  Well, is it not abuse to take an 11-year-old or 12-year-old boy to a porno theater?
[02:28:09.355 --> 02:28:12.038]  I mean, I wouldn't go to one of those myself.
[02:28:12.058 --> 02:28:15.622]  A crazy girlfriend in college once wanted to go to one, and I said, you know, I'm a hell no, lady.
[02:28:16.223 --> 02:28:19.286]  So, I mean, as an adult, I wouldn't go on one of those filthy things.
[02:28:19.666 --> 02:28:21.168]  So, that's what I'm saying is, we're... Wow.
[02:28:24.662 --> 02:28:37.288]  You know, and then too, because of all of this and what he's done, I've got a film going now that I've written three years ago before I met Donald Trump, before Donald Trump was running for president.
[02:28:37.849 --> 02:28:44.032]  And this film happens to go along with everything he's promoting in his administration.
[02:28:44.172 --> 02:28:46.053]  Well, let's talk about that when we come back, Dan.
[02:28:46.093 --> 02:28:47.154]  This is very interesting.
[02:28:47.514 --> 02:28:51.397]  Quentin Tarantino's biological father on video Skype with us.
[02:28:51.417 --> 02:28:52.939]  If you're a TV viewer or radio listener, you can hear him.
[02:28:53.439 --> 02:28:53.819]  Amazing.
[02:28:53.879 --> 02:28:55.641]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:28:56.301 --> 02:29:03.346]  And they were pulling up articles where Tarantino said, all my films are... Nothing to call me.
[02:29:03.446 --> 02:29:05.368]  I just read your books.
[02:29:05.408 --> 02:29:06.829]  No, it's not legal.
[02:29:07.569 --> 02:29:07.770]  Right.
[02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:08.990]  You already said it's illegal, didn't you?
[02:29:09.131 --> 02:29:09.631]  Of course not.
[02:29:09.651 --> 02:29:10.912]  I'm a law-abiding citizen, aren't you?
[02:29:12.285 --> 02:29:13.745]  We're all law-abiding in our own ways.
[02:29:13.765 --> 02:29:16.766]  Um, let's see here.
[02:29:18.006 --> 02:29:19.267]  Really, you don't do anything illegal?
[02:29:19.907 --> 02:29:20.067]  Nope.
[02:29:20.367 --> 02:29:21.507]  Do you do anything illegal?
[02:29:21.927 --> 02:29:23.447]  Why would you come in here and ask me that?
[02:29:23.467 --> 02:29:24.348]  That's kind of messed up.
[02:29:24.408 --> 02:29:25.428]  Well, I'm just assuming.
[02:29:25.488 --> 02:29:27.368]  Why are you being aggro, though?
[02:29:27.528 --> 02:29:28.229]  I'm not being aggro.
[02:29:28.289 --> 02:29:29.749]  I'm just being, like, inquisitive.
[02:29:30.049 --> 02:29:32.549]  Right, but the first thing you did is you came in and asked me if I sell the kites.
[02:29:32.569 --> 02:29:33.450]  I don't even know what that is.
[02:29:33.470 --> 02:29:34.530]  You don't even know what kites are.
[02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.930]  What is it?
[02:29:35.230 --> 02:29:35.530]  Jews.
[02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:37.110]  Jews?
[02:29:37.391 --> 02:29:37.651]  Yeah.
[02:29:38.411 --> 02:29:39.271]  It's a problem because you don't.
[02:29:41.175 --> 02:29:43.036]  Well, I would sell the Jews, sure.
[02:29:43.256 --> 02:29:43.537]  Really?
[02:29:43.557 --> 02:29:45.077]  That's culturally funny.
[02:29:45.097 --> 02:29:47.399]  You don't like Jews much?
[02:29:47.599 --> 02:29:48.940]  No, I love Jews, I just don't know.
[02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:50.421]  I'm surprised you don't hate them.
[02:29:50.441 --> 02:29:52.122]  Those are free, you can take one of those if you want.
[02:29:52.282 --> 02:29:52.882]  Free Bibles?
[02:29:52.982 --> 02:29:53.222]  Sure.
[02:29:53.723 --> 02:29:56.684]  Are these, um... You can read it, burn it, do whatever you want with it.
[02:29:56.824 --> 02:29:57.105]  Really?
[02:29:57.265 --> 02:29:57.485]  Yeah.
[02:29:57.645 --> 02:29:59.626]  That's actually nice of you, because I would burn it.
[02:30:00.146 --> 02:30:00.367]  Okay.
[02:30:00.627 --> 02:30:05.850]  But, I mean, actually, are these... Are these New Testament?
[02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:07.371]  Yeah, new and old.
[02:30:08.183 --> 02:30:09.025]  Oh, it's got both.
[02:30:09.365 --> 02:30:09.606]  Right.
[02:30:09.866 --> 02:30:10.747]  Holy crap.
[02:30:11.328 --> 02:30:13.392]  And I think it's about ready to pick up those Bibles.
[02:30:16.517 --> 02:30:20.664]  And now she's throwing them up on the deal.
[02:30:37.441 --> 02:30:40.863]  Yeah, um, my name is Don and I'm with Private Sector Arms over in West Olympia.
[02:30:41.283 --> 02:30:51.227]  I just had somebody who walked in and they're still outside my store but they took a big stack of Bibles and started throwing them at the store and now it's throwing stuff up onto the ceiling and I think they're coming back.
[02:30:51.267 --> 02:30:53.288]  You said I could do whatever I wanted with them?
[02:30:54.029 --> 02:30:55.009]  Yeah.
[02:30:55.049 --> 02:30:55.389]  Yeah?
[02:30:55.449 --> 02:30:56.450]  Uh, 3012 Harrison Avenue.
[02:30:59.991 --> 02:31:00.411]  I don't know.
[02:31:02.092 --> 02:31:02.332]  Hi.
[02:31:03.273 --> 02:31:03.733]  Say hi for me.
[02:31:04.446 --> 02:31:05.887]  You know, I don't really think it's funny.
[02:31:06.068 --> 02:31:08.430]  I mean, this person is whacked out, man.
[02:31:08.770 --> 02:31:11.593]  They think an American flag's Nazi, a Gadsden flag's Nazi.
[02:31:11.613 --> 02:31:16.357]  They grab Bibles, they're throwing them all over the place, cracking the window, throwing them on the roof.
[02:31:16.657 --> 02:31:19.360]  And this is a literal brainwashed victim.
[02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:21.021]  And this is what SJWs are like.
[02:31:21.041 --> 02:31:25.603]  So Don Teague was born in Washington and raised in the Philippines during the Marcos dictatorship.
[02:31:25.663 --> 02:31:27.984]  As a missionary in the 80s and 90s, he saw early age.
[02:31:28.064 --> 02:31:32.326]  Being a citizen was the right to bear arms was one of the greatest things about this country's freedom.
[02:31:32.386 --> 02:31:34.327]  So we're gonna talk to him right now.
[02:31:34.507 --> 02:31:36.148]  Thank you for joining us, Don.
[02:31:36.268 --> 02:31:37.328]  Do you think this is funny?
[02:31:37.368 --> 02:31:38.569]  I'm not putting down Steven Crowder.
[02:31:38.609 --> 02:31:39.149]  He's a comic.
[02:31:39.529 --> 02:31:40.610]  I think it's very disturbing.
[02:31:42.108 --> 02:31:42.949]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:31:43.049 --> 02:31:44.651]  No, I don't think that's very funny at all.
[02:31:45.953 --> 02:31:48.476]  Unfortunately, it's pretty par for the course around here.
[02:31:48.496 --> 02:31:58.007]  A lot of people act like that, a lot of people talk like that, and drop all the words that everybody seems to be buzzing about these days.
[02:31:59.035 --> 02:32:00.796]  But yeah, it was ridiculous.
[02:32:01.677 --> 02:32:06.519]  She comes in, she starts asking me right off the bat, using Nazi terms.
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:18.366]  I'm assuming that she thought I was a Nazi, and so she wanted to, I don't know what, trap me in my prejudice by being like, you know, hell no, I'd never sell to those people.
[02:32:18.726 --> 02:32:21.768]  But like I said, we see it a lot, but not to that level.
[02:32:21.828 --> 02:32:24.749]  I mean, I didn't really think she would take it that far.
[02:32:25.249 --> 02:32:27.991]  I guess I probably gave her a little bit too much rope to hang herself with.
[02:32:28.829 --> 02:32:40.719]  But, uh, you know, there wasn't a whole lot of damage other than, I think, mainly for everybody just kind of now validating that, yes, in fact, people are out there like that.
[02:32:40.959 --> 02:32:42.000]  They do feel that way.
[02:32:42.300 --> 02:32:43.441]  They are saying those things.
[02:32:43.461 --> 02:32:45.123]  They are coming up, getting in your face.
[02:32:45.483 --> 02:32:52.549]  They're trying to bait you into doing something that they can then justify whatever kind of violence they want to inflict upon you.
[02:32:53.430 --> 02:32:56.893]  Why she choose to do that in a gun shop, I have no idea.
[02:33:03.504 --> 02:33:09.710]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.036 --> 02:33:23.763]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:33:23.983 --> 02:33:26.045]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:33:28.257 --> 02:33:33.218]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.478 --> 02:33:41.900]  Coming up after our guest leaves, we've got 16 Russians indicted, 3 institutions, 13 people.
[02:33:49.434 --> 02:33:50.875]  This is amazingly good news.
[02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:52.336]  It shows Mueller has nothing.
[02:33:53.496 --> 02:33:58.560]  It is low-level PR companies that were trying to get advertising for their products.
[02:33:58.580 --> 02:34:00.381]  They were attacking Hillary, supporting Hillary.
[02:34:00.761 --> 02:34:07.905]  They were hijacking every meme out there, which thousands of companies we know of, to say thousands, that's conservative.
[02:34:08.886 --> 02:34:13.328]  They just take whatever the trend is and they just write stuff about it, they link to it, and you jump on it.
[02:34:13.729 --> 02:34:15.169]  That's how a lot of people run the Internet.
[02:34:16.410 --> 02:34:17.451]  We try to lead the Internet.
[02:34:19.195 --> 02:34:25.518]  We tried to actually create, you know, the new research, the new trends to wake people up.
[02:34:25.538 --> 02:34:27.298]  But let's put DrudgeReport.com back up.
[02:34:27.318 --> 02:34:28.639]  Let's see the headline.
[02:34:28.959 --> 02:34:29.419]  D.C.
[02:34:29.499 --> 02:34:29.839]  rocked!
[02:34:29.939 --> 02:34:31.340]  Mueller indicts 13 Russians.
[02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:32.440]  Trolls of 2016.
[02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:34.961]  And Drudge has got the right term.
[02:34:34.981 --> 02:34:38.543]  I was trying to think during the last hour, who are these people?
[02:34:39.083 --> 02:34:40.944]  They're attacking Trump during the campaign.
[02:34:40.984 --> 02:34:41.944]  They're supporting him.
[02:34:42.405 --> 02:34:43.885]  They're attacking him after.
[02:34:43.905 --> 02:34:48.067]  And I went, wait a minute, why are so many of those things they jumped on?
[02:34:49.653 --> 02:34:53.174]  Things I said, things we created, like Hillary for Prison 2016.
[02:34:53.294 --> 02:34:58.076]  And it's because they were viral.
[02:34:59.677 --> 02:35:02.017]  I mean, we sold, by then, like 80,000 t-shirts.
[02:35:02.858 --> 02:35:05.499]  Trump was like, my God, Alex, everywhere I go, your t-shirts are there.
[02:35:06.019 --> 02:35:08.079]  You'd go to the RNC, it was just every other shirt.
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:09.540]  People saw that.
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:10.300]  They jumped on it.
[02:35:11.221 --> 02:35:14.322]  And then they go, oh, Jones, Hillary for Prison is the Russians.
[02:35:14.362 --> 02:35:15.262]  No, it's me.
[02:35:15.762 --> 02:35:16.683]  It's you, the listeners.
[02:35:16.723 --> 02:35:17.763]  You decided to buy the shirt.
[02:35:19.491 --> 02:35:20.252]  It got huge.
[02:35:21.173 --> 02:35:23.757]  Some Russian marketing company's name, Politico, jumped on.
[02:35:24.077 --> 02:35:25.519]  And that's all Mueller's got.
[02:35:25.639 --> 02:35:26.741]  This is incredible.
[02:35:28.443 --> 02:35:32.689]  Tony Tarantino, Father Quentin Tarantino, I'm not on some mission against Quentin.
[02:35:33.826 --> 02:35:41.311]  And you're his dad, and you've been in a lot of films, a lot of movies before him, and it's strange that you were already in film, and your dad was in film, and then he got into it.
[02:35:41.671 --> 02:35:45.894]  Maybe, I guess, because he was looking back on what you'd done, but you've got to do film out, or film you're producing.
[02:35:45.934 --> 02:35:46.515]  Tell us about that.
[02:35:46.535 --> 02:35:47.375]  You want to produce.
[02:35:47.956 --> 02:35:55.481]  But just getting into his psychology, you mentioned when he wrote the book, you're being careful here about being taken to porno theaters by his mother.
[02:35:55.941 --> 02:36:01.284]  Back when, I guess, there wasn't internet or wasn't Cinemax or whatever on cable.
[02:36:01.344 --> 02:36:02.986]  I have seen that when I was a teenager.
[02:36:03.686 --> 02:36:06.608]  You know, that's a damn good question.
[02:36:06.628 --> 02:36:09.049]  The only thing I can come up with is because of power.
[02:36:09.350 --> 02:36:09.910]  You know, money.
[02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:28.614]  And basically, in my opinion, that's the same strength of the same position.
[02:36:44.554 --> 02:36:45.354]  Yeah, let's put that up.
[02:36:45.374 --> 02:36:46.855]  Tony Tarantino with Harvey Weinstein.
[02:36:46.875 --> 02:36:47.495]  We have that photo.
[02:36:47.515 --> 02:36:48.455]  Let's put that up.
[02:36:48.515 --> 02:36:49.016]  Go ahead.
[02:37:09.233 --> 02:37:14.476]  Uh, now that was an award ceremony for Quentin at the Beverly Center.
[02:37:15.077 --> 02:37:18.539]  I saw Harvey walking up and I was excited.
[02:37:18.639 --> 02:37:20.020]  I wanted to go over and meet him.
[02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:27.684]  He was walking up and he had this gorgeous young thing on his arm and I walked up to him and I said, Hey, Harvey, let me introduce myself.
[02:37:27.804 --> 02:37:29.085]  I'm Tony Tarantino.
[02:37:29.485 --> 02:37:33.087]  And he looked at me really out like, and he said, don't bother me.
[02:37:33.187 --> 02:37:34.268]  I'm busy right now.
[02:37:34.748 --> 02:37:35.849]  And I looked at him and
[02:37:36.872 --> 02:37:37.593]  I like you.
[02:37:37.793 --> 02:37:41.077]  I say what comes to my head and a lot of times it gets me in trouble.
[02:37:42.038 --> 02:37:45.722]  And I just looked at him and I said, yeah, Harvey, that's obvious.
[02:37:45.742 --> 02:37:47.404]  You're too busy being an asshole.
[02:37:48.525 --> 02:37:49.426]  And walked off.
[02:37:51.809 --> 02:37:54.472]  That was my introduction to Harvey White.
[02:37:56.425 --> 02:38:12.717]  These people, all of them, regardless of who they are, they become so full of themselves and self-importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law, they're above reproach, and they can get away with any damn thing they feel like.
[02:38:13.337 --> 02:38:22.804]  And when you listen to some of the idiotic things that he has said, not just now, but all through his career, ever since he became well-known.
[02:38:23.883 --> 02:38:25.785]  And to me, that's really too bad.
[02:38:25.845 --> 02:38:30.329]  Hey, I'm an actor, but I'm no different than anybody else.
[02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:31.770]  That's what I do for a living.
[02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:37.255]  That doesn't make me above anybody else in any other way.
[02:38:38.816 --> 02:38:40.798]  It's just what you do for a living.
[02:38:41.999 --> 02:38:43.120]  You have a job.
[02:38:43.979 --> 02:38:46.721]  You have what you do for a living and you're good at it.
[02:38:47.021 --> 02:38:55.286]  But that doesn't set you up against the rest of the world and make you any better of a person than anybody else.
[02:38:55.306 --> 02:38:59.609]  And people that take that attitude and think they are, they're sick.
[02:39:00.791 --> 02:39:02.172]  They have a real problem.
[02:39:02.212 --> 02:39:03.834]  They need to come back down to earth.
[02:39:03.934 --> 02:39:05.395]  Somebody needs to put them there.
[02:39:05.935 --> 02:39:07.997]  And, honestly, that's not my intent.
[02:39:08.017 --> 02:39:08.738]  I don't want to hurt them.
[02:39:08.778 --> 02:39:10.059]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:13.222]  It was 16 years ago, because my son's almost 16.
[02:39:13.282 --> 02:39:15.263]  My ex-wife was about six months pregnant.
[02:39:16.404 --> 02:39:19.207]  And, uh, there was one Alamo draft house.
[02:39:19.247 --> 02:39:20.388]  Then it was called the Ritz downtown.
[02:39:20.408 --> 02:39:21.409]  It's a new location now.
[02:39:21.749 --> 02:39:25.052]  But it was a big theater they built out of an old warehouse.
[02:39:27.659 --> 02:39:28.840]  I went to see The French Connection.
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:30.883]  I knew the director was going to be there, but I didn't care about that.
[02:39:30.903 --> 02:39:32.805]  It was back when there weren't a lot of movie theaters.
[02:39:33.366 --> 02:39:35.108]  They were going to show The Exorcist next, and he died.
[02:39:35.128 --> 02:39:35.768]  I didn't care about that.
[02:39:35.788 --> 02:39:36.990]  I only bought the ticket for the first movie.
[02:39:37.330 --> 02:39:38.411]  So I go with my pregnant wife.
[02:39:38.832 --> 02:39:39.433]  We sit down.
[02:39:39.453 --> 02:39:41.355]  I watch the movie.
[02:39:41.635 --> 02:39:42.156]  Eat pizza.
[02:39:43.437 --> 02:39:46.199]  But of course, Quentin got up at the first, and then the director came on.
[02:39:46.219 --> 02:39:51.824]  So I'm leaving, and then one of the guys associated with the local paper comes and gets to my face and says, what are you doing here?
[02:39:51.844 --> 02:39:57.768]  And then Quentin walks over out in the big hall, open area, and goes, what the F are you doing here, Bob?
[02:39:57.788 --> 02:39:58.789]  Well, I guess he knew who I was.
[02:39:59.370 --> 02:40:01.892]  I kind of ignored it, and my ex-wife comes out of the bathroom.
[02:40:02.712 --> 02:40:04.373]  And I say, let's get out of here.
[02:40:04.393 --> 02:40:11.336]  And then I'm going down the stairs and the guy affiliated with the local newspaper, affiliated with it, nobody's going down the big red stairs at that point.
[02:40:11.416 --> 02:40:12.177]  Everybody's upstairs.
[02:40:12.597 --> 02:40:15.218]  He jumps down on his feet and tries to knock her down the stairs.
[02:40:15.659 --> 02:40:16.899]  And then he laughs and goes, oh, I'm sorry.
[02:40:16.919 --> 02:40:17.459]  It's an accident.
[02:40:17.479 --> 02:40:18.060]  It's an accident.
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:21.481]  And they had the local paper person up there with a pad in their hand.
[02:40:21.501 --> 02:40:22.022]  It was a lady.
[02:40:22.622 --> 02:40:23.702]  And then no one's up there.
[02:40:23.742 --> 02:40:24.203]  I'm looking up.
[02:40:24.223 --> 02:40:25.864]  It's this big area, open area outside.
[02:40:25.884 --> 02:40:26.984]  There's only one theater there.
[02:40:29.261 --> 02:40:34.802]  Because Quentin Tarantino kind of pops out like a, like a barracuda or something and just goes right back.
[02:40:35.443 --> 02:40:38.483]  And so I don't think he was behind that, but he told me to get the F out of here.
[02:40:39.163 --> 02:40:43.845]  Just the arrogance of somebody like that to, to, to act like that.
[02:40:43.945 --> 02:40:53.007]  That's why when I saw him do the Howard Stern stuff and say a big deal about sex with little, you know, little girls or whatever, it just made me ask, this guy really thinks he's God.
[02:40:54.537 --> 02:40:56.798]  Yeah, yeah, and he's proven that.
[02:40:57.299 --> 02:41:01.221]  I don't know why, but he's really come after me big time.
[02:41:02.782 --> 02:41:10.727]  I had PRISM funded through Wells Fargo Bank, and then I got a call, and I had it on voicemail because I couldn't take the call at the time.
[02:41:11.068 --> 02:41:23.936]  The vice president of finance over at Wells Fargo Bank called me, and on a voicemail, he said, hey, we got a visit from Weinstein and Quentin, and after a discussion with them, we decided not to go with you.
[02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:27.923]  And then not long after that, I got another deal.
[02:41:27.943 --> 02:41:30.084]  That was a $55 million deal.
[02:41:30.564 --> 02:41:38.988]  Then after that, I got another deal with a company called Cedar Fair.
[02:41:39.589 --> 02:41:44.091]  They own all these amusement parks, like Knott's Ferry Farm.
[02:41:44.847 --> 02:41:46.208]  And they were going with me.
[02:41:46.489 --> 02:41:56.898]  And then because I was all over the Internet and everywhere else supporting Donald Trump, I got an email from them saying, hey, we decided not to go with you.
[02:41:56.958 --> 02:41:59.020]  You're too politically sensitive.
[02:42:00.531 --> 02:42:01.372]  That's how it works.
[02:42:01.692 --> 02:42:04.573]  So they have, they claim there's a red list and they've been persecuted.
[02:42:04.913 --> 02:42:15.919]  They're persecuting people that are just common sense and are anti-America and they think it's all funny and I was reading about him spitting on Uma Thurman and you're like, but it happened to me.
[02:42:16.019 --> 02:42:23.462]  It's like, it's just like some dude wanting to be a big bully and do whatever he wants and at a certain point he's getting called out.
[02:42:23.502 --> 02:42:25.043]  TarantinoProductions.com.
[02:42:25.383 --> 02:42:26.944]  People can find out about your new productions there.
[02:42:26.964 --> 02:42:28.465]  Look forward to speaking to you again.
[02:42:29.065 --> 02:42:32.027]  You and the future, Tony Tarantino, thank you so much.
[02:42:33.187 --> 02:42:33.748]  Thank you, sir.
[02:42:34.468 --> 02:42:36.189]  All right, we'll be back with all the big news.
[02:42:36.269 --> 02:42:39.831]  Boiled down, a lot of it's been breaking since we had him on for the last 40 minutes.
[02:42:40.331 --> 02:42:42.933]  Very interesting, though, and I don't care about Hollywood.
[02:42:42.953 --> 02:42:45.714]  I don't care about, you know, all their stupid crap.
[02:42:45.754 --> 02:42:49.136]  I'm not attacking it because I'm not part of it because I've already turned it all down.
[02:42:49.716 --> 02:42:56.000]  I'm covering it so you understand why you hear people like Tarantino say this type of evil crap.
[02:43:00.191 --> 02:43:02.131]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:02.151 --> 02:43:02.592]  Go ahead.
[02:43:02.872 --> 02:43:05.052]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:05.072 --> 02:43:08.113]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:08.933 --> 02:43:10.053]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:10.373 --> 02:43:12.094]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:12.794 --> 02:43:14.874]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:15.114 --> 02:43:19.095]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:19.115 --> 02:43:21.556]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:22.436 --> 02:43:24.738]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:25.098 --> 02:43:26.178]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:26.459 --> 02:43:27.359]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:27.579 --> 02:43:28.640]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:30.101]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:30.121 --> 02:43:31.222]  Put him on pause again.
[02:43:31.242 --> 02:43:32.062]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:32.342 --> 02:43:37.686]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:37.986 --> 02:43:42.288]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:42.509 --> 02:43:45.390]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:46.031]  You understand?
[02:43:46.131 --> 02:43:47.392]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:47.772 --> 02:43:48.892]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:49.873 --> 02:43:54.805]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:43:55.466 --> 02:43:56.208]  Do you understand?
[02:43:56.328 --> 02:43:57.451]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:57.852 --> 02:43:59.315]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:44:02.519 --> 02:44:10.561]  Interesting thought from Donald Trump about the size of his nuclear button and the threat that he just put up against the North Korean leader.
[02:44:10.581 --> 02:44:10.981]  Your thoughts?
[02:44:11.581 --> 02:44:20.483]  As we saw all through 2017, men with profound sexual insecurity can wreak a lot of havoc in the lives of women, in the lives of their families.
[02:44:21.283 --> 02:44:30.665]  But perhaps never have we seen a man whose profound sexual and masculine insecurities are literally threatening to annihilate the planet.
[02:44:30.725 --> 02:44:31.965]  I mean, the way he's literally
[02:44:32.505 --> 02:44:33.467]  We didn't start this.
[02:44:33.487 --> 02:44:36.009]  Kim Jong-un was given the missiles, the secrets by the Clintons.
[02:44:52.088 --> 02:44:53.029]  He's aiming at us.
[02:44:53.209 --> 02:44:54.090]  I don't want to go to war.
[02:44:54.250 --> 02:44:55.311]  I'm against all this.
[02:44:55.571 --> 02:45:05.219]  But that said, the media, CNN, all of them, Gerald, they keep literally one-sided, only attacking the president, and never even saying anything bad about Kim Jong-un anymore.
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:08.422]  Or Communist China, or Foxcom Suicide Nets.
[02:45:08.862 --> 02:45:10.664]  What do you really think is going on here?
[02:45:10.684 --> 02:45:15.248]  And let's get into the larger, larger issue of this with Gerald Celente of TrendsResearch.com.
[02:45:16.489 --> 02:45:23.714]  Well, first of all, why would anybody listen to this little boy who was just talking over there about, you know, sexuality?
[02:45:24.315 --> 02:45:28.638]  And that was the major story, according to AP, of 2017.
[02:45:29.019 --> 02:45:30.340]  Harassment.
[02:45:32.221 --> 02:45:34.203]  So, it's what the media is.
[02:45:34.303 --> 02:45:42.309]  It's just dumbed down and stupid, and I don't know why anybody would listen to or pay attention to these people.
[02:45:42.690 --> 02:45:44.031]  If the United States
[02:45:44.731 --> 02:45:51.354]  ...attacks North Korea for any reason, for whatever reason, say goodbye to South Korea.
[02:45:51.374 --> 02:45:55.736]  I mean, Seoul is what, 35 miles from the border?
[02:45:56.156 --> 02:45:58.317]  And we got 24 million people there?
[02:45:58.337 --> 02:46:01.838]  And they, hey, goodbye Japan, see you later.
[02:46:02.158 --> 02:46:06.640]  So I think this is more rhetoric, and I see some positive movements.
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:12.562]  When you're seeing that, you know, they want to talk about the Olympics and how they could participate in it.
[02:46:12.642 --> 02:46:13.983]  And the future is peace.
[02:46:14.403 --> 02:46:19.265]  I mean, if we go into war, I mean, look, how many more do we have to look at?
[02:46:19.685 --> 02:46:21.946]  Wonderful day in Afghanistan today.
[02:46:22.206 --> 02:46:22.766]  Let's go.
[02:46:22.786 --> 02:46:27.028]  Why don't we, you know, Alex, why don't we go meet in Baghdad and have a nice time?
[02:46:27.068 --> 02:46:31.830]  And after that, we could take a trip to Tripoli and maybe Damascus.
[02:46:32.270 --> 02:46:34.192]  I mean, look what's going on in the world.
[02:46:34.652 --> 02:46:39.537]  So the only future that I see that's profitable is for peace.
[02:46:39.977 --> 02:46:49.946]  And I think there's some strong movements in that direction because there will be no winner if the United States and North Korea go to war.
[02:46:50.506 --> 02:46:55.631]  It's, you know, again, there'll be mass murder there and there'll be no end in sight.
[02:47:04.426 --> 02:47:07.168]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.253 --> 02:47:20.419]  Alright, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:47:20.899 --> 02:47:21.480]  I'm your host.
[02:47:22.691 --> 02:47:23.512]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:47:23.652 --> 02:47:37.461]  Joel Gilbert's coming up with guest Larry Klayman, the founder of Judicial Watch, with key intel in the next hour, with all the big breaking news that's unfolding in the war room with Owen Schroer, and of course, Roger Stone is here in studio, here in the ATX.
[02:47:40.764 --> 02:47:45.167]  Before I hit the final news that I'm going to hit in this hour, I just want to make a point.
[02:47:47.569 --> 02:47:51.712]  I can't open a newspaper or turn on a television channel
[02:47:52.628 --> 02:48:02.931]  Or go see a movie, or turn on Netflix, or HBO, or Amazon, and there not be just anti-Trump stuff everywhere.
[02:48:05.792 --> 02:48:09.533]  And then below that, there's anti-Alex Jones stuff everywhere.
[02:48:11.293 --> 02:48:13.274]  And it's not like, oh look, they're attacking me!
[02:48:14.034 --> 02:48:14.794]  It's not like that.
[02:48:22.133 --> 02:48:30.982]  And so I'm sitting there last night with my son, and he's looking at documentaries, and it's like all this anti-Trump stuff, and there was some show I called Scams or something on Netflix, I forget.
[02:48:31.662 --> 02:48:33.884]  And one of them's Donald Trump, and I already knew all about it.
[02:48:34.827 --> 02:48:35.828]  So I said, let's watch this.
[02:48:36.288 --> 02:48:37.969]  The thing was like almost two hours long.
[02:48:38.029 --> 02:48:38.669]  We sit there.
[02:48:39.290 --> 02:48:40.951]  We started the thing like nine o'clock at night.
[02:48:40.991 --> 02:48:42.252]  I never stay up to 11 anymore.
[02:48:42.272 --> 02:48:42.952]  I'm like an old man.
[02:48:42.972 --> 02:48:44.293]  So I got up at like 5 a.m.
[02:48:44.793 --> 02:48:49.176]  I watched this whole thing and it was all lies and distortion.
[02:48:49.596 --> 02:48:51.617]  And it isn't like I'm just defending Trump.
[02:48:52.057 --> 02:48:53.778]  I know all about that stuff.
[02:48:56.700 --> 02:48:58.982]  And I've experienced the lies.
[02:48:59.042 --> 02:49:02.364]  And then I just say to myself, what is it about this guy?
[02:49:03.533 --> 02:49:05.274]  That's got them so scared.
[02:49:05.854 --> 02:49:10.797]  And I look into my gut and my gut goes back Trump, back Trump, back Trump.
[02:49:10.817 --> 02:49:11.238]  He's real.
[02:49:11.258 --> 02:49:11.578]  He's real.
[02:49:12.138 --> 02:49:15.640]  From way before I ever came on the show, I ever talked to him on the phone.
[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:17.241]  I'm not into politicians.
[02:49:17.281 --> 02:49:18.202]  I'm not into celebrities.
[02:49:18.262 --> 02:49:21.624]  I don't Trump's kind of goofy with the stupid hair and all of it.
[02:49:21.684 --> 02:49:22.644]  It's not about that.
[02:49:25.486 --> 02:49:27.767]  I'm totally liberated not caring about celebrity.
[02:49:30.068 --> 02:49:30.969]  But with Trump,
[02:49:33.015 --> 02:49:34.096]  There was something different.
[02:49:36.039 --> 02:49:43.368]  And you know somebody by their enemies, and the way they hate him, and the way when I watched that show, like all the other ones I've seen, it was the exact same thing.
[02:49:44.249 --> 02:49:45.030]  Oh, he's fake.
[02:49:45.151 --> 02:49:46.132]  Oh, he's a loser.
[02:49:46.272 --> 02:49:47.934]  Oh, maybe he only has 10 billion.
[02:49:47.954 --> 02:49:49.015]  He claims he's so rich.
[02:49:49.556 --> 02:49:50.678]  But you know the big secret?
[02:49:52.299 --> 02:49:54.581]  Almost no one in the last 50 years.
[02:49:55.242 --> 02:49:59.126]  Almost all our fortunes were made by mavericks like Trump before.
[02:49:59.707 --> 02:50:04.631]  But the last 50 years they were all made by combines and centralized groups and these societies.
[02:50:05.172 --> 02:50:10.798]  Trump did do hundreds of things, did fail at dozens of things.
[02:50:12.179 --> 02:50:14.161]  He's total Americana.
[02:50:18.530 --> 02:50:19.771]  And that's why they're so scared.
[02:50:20.291 --> 02:50:21.452]  He does go with his gut.
[02:50:22.153 --> 02:50:23.153]  He is impetuous.
[02:50:23.213 --> 02:50:27.996]  He does do these things, and that's what I'm like, and that's what you're like, and that's why they hate us.
[02:50:30.058 --> 02:50:38.504]  And you watch these documentaries and all the rest of it, and you really realize what these people are like.
[02:50:43.747 --> 02:50:47.550]  And it would show these people that were given access to Trump that would stab in the back
[02:50:49.963 --> 02:50:51.284]  And say crappy things about him.
[02:50:52.084 --> 02:50:54.645]  Like, oh, in between divorces he really loved hot women.
[02:50:54.785 --> 02:50:56.006]  Oh my God, what a demon.
[02:50:56.766 --> 02:50:59.508]  But if you're trying to screw little kids that you kidnap, that's fine.
[02:50:59.868 --> 02:51:05.991]  You know, when all you goody two-shoes are mad about pedophilia, I'll start worrying about grown men, you know, in between divorces liking hot women.
[02:51:06.211 --> 02:51:07.112]  That's how God built us.
[02:51:07.132 --> 02:51:09.153]  And I'm not saying all of it's good or perfect.
[02:51:09.253 --> 02:51:09.633]  I get it.
[02:51:10.093 --> 02:51:14.635]  The point is, get this beam out of your own eye before you tell me to get a speck out of mine.
[02:51:14.775 --> 02:51:15.336]  It's just...
[02:51:16.317 --> 02:51:19.778]  My gut tells me Trump's good, and then it's delivering.
[02:51:20.318 --> 02:51:21.438]  My gut's never wrong!
[02:51:24.618 --> 02:51:26.199]  I didn't like the Hollywood Trump.
[02:51:26.379 --> 02:51:27.799]  I didn't like the Apprentice Trump.
[02:51:27.879 --> 02:51:34.600]  I don't... But then once I got the political Trump, I was like, and that's the real Trump, that's what they're scared of.
[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:45.082]  The evil spirit that is globalism hates Trump, because he simply wants prosperity, and he's confident.
[02:51:47.253 --> 02:51:52.577]  See, a Satanist is really immature, and they're very, very insecure.
[02:51:53.717 --> 02:52:01.162]  They are really scared by Trump, because they act all secure, and they act all invincible, and they act like they're fake until they make it.
[02:52:04.124 --> 02:52:04.865]  Trump's already made it.
[02:52:06.906 --> 02:52:08.927]  And you've already made it.
[02:52:09.988 --> 02:52:11.449]  Because you don't want to screw people over.
[02:52:11.729 --> 02:52:12.830]  You're already confident.
[02:52:13.170 --> 02:52:14.131]  You're not looking for power.
[02:52:16.052 --> 02:52:17.033]  That's why they hate you.
[02:52:19.249 --> 02:52:21.472]  And so, that's why I back Trump.
[02:52:21.532 --> 02:52:22.072]  Is he perfect?
[02:52:22.132 --> 02:52:22.653]  Absolutely not.
[02:52:23.074 --> 02:52:23.975]  Has he made a lot of mistakes?
[02:52:23.995 --> 02:52:24.255]  Yeah.
[02:52:24.916 --> 02:52:27.979]  If I was in his position, I'd have done a worse job, I can tell you right now.
[02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:30.022]  We're not gods, we're men.
[02:52:32.445 --> 02:52:35.749]  And, I look at this Stormy Daniels thing.
[02:52:37.179 --> 02:52:38.720]  Right before he got remarried or whatever.
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.702]  And now, you know, she got paid off or whatever.
[02:52:42.703 --> 02:52:44.664]  And she admitted it was all consensual or whatever.
[02:52:44.684 --> 02:52:50.988]  And, oh, she saved the dresses and now they're gonna see if any of his DNA's on it.
[02:52:51.909 --> 02:52:53.490]  Like he did something wrong.
[02:52:53.570 --> 02:52:56.252]  Like a woman wants to be with him and he's with her.
[02:52:56.632 --> 02:53:00.235]  And then now, the treachery of this.
[02:53:04.008 --> 02:53:06.190]  I'm not saying Stormy Daniels has even done all that.
[02:53:06.850 --> 02:53:10.173]  The point is, is that's how the media pushes all this.
[02:53:10.233 --> 02:53:14.177]  Like, oh, ISIS can murder and sell little girls into sex slavery, that's okay.
[02:53:14.197 --> 02:53:19.501]  But if Donald Trump has consensual sex with a woman 14 years ago, it's the end of the world.
[02:53:20.603 --> 02:53:21.344]  And that's what I mean.
[02:53:21.364 --> 02:53:25.148]  And then Quentin Tarantino says you can rape a 13 year old.
[02:53:26.269 --> 02:53:27.130]  It's consensual.
[02:53:28.111 --> 02:53:28.651]  It's what I mean.
[02:53:28.711 --> 02:53:32.875]  It's like they're the group that has no morals that knows we have morals.
[02:53:33.636 --> 02:53:39.382]  And so it messes with us all day about how we're not perfect when it's completely evil.
[02:53:41.384 --> 02:53:42.505]  And that's what I'm getting at here.
[02:53:47.025 --> 02:53:52.130]  Yeah, Stormy Daniels has a Monica Lewinsky dress to test for Trump's DNA, reports us.
[02:53:52.711 --> 02:53:53.451]  God Almighty.
[02:53:54.452 --> 02:53:55.173]  It never ends.
[02:53:56.534 --> 02:53:57.715]  So, that's where I stand.
[02:53:58.276 --> 02:54:05.363]  Meanwhile, North Korea has told its military they're gonna strike Tokyo, Japan between the 28th of March.
[02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:09.141]  And April 2nd.
[02:54:09.901 --> 02:54:14.263]  And you know, mainstream media puts out fake leaks and fake reports and fake sources.
[02:54:15.143 --> 02:54:17.984]  Let me tell you something, those aren't fake sources with me.
[02:54:20.265 --> 02:54:27.648]  I'd rather blow my head off, which I don't want to do by the way, never commit suicide, than lie to you.
[02:54:27.788 --> 02:54:31.790]  My only value is that I tell the truth.
[02:54:33.751 --> 02:54:35.772]  The globalists call that a weakness, I call it a strength.
[02:54:40.051 --> 02:54:42.352]  Are the people telling me that trying to manipulate me?
[02:54:42.812 --> 02:54:43.433]  Maybe so.
[02:54:44.653 --> 02:54:50.516]  You should, I mean I said, so does the Deputy Director want me to say this?
[02:54:50.997 --> 02:54:52.637]  Well, you're authorized to say it.
[02:54:53.478 --> 02:54:54.318]  No, I want to know.
[02:54:56.579 --> 02:54:58.040]  Do they want this said and why?
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:54:59.561]  We're not going to tell you.
[02:55:00.541 --> 02:55:02.242]  But obviously we're authorized to tell you this.
[02:55:02.722 --> 02:55:03.823]  I ignore it for a few weeks.
[02:55:05.264 --> 02:55:07.745]  Then more contacts, more, more, more, more.
[02:55:08.185 --> 02:55:09.366]  We want you
[02:55:10.954 --> 02:55:17.236]  Warn people, because we don't want to cause a panic, but we want the armed service network that listens to you and everybody to know this.
[02:55:18.116 --> 02:55:21.117]  And I'm like, am I being used in some larger thing to hype war?
[02:55:21.577 --> 02:55:22.938]  I don't think that's what Trump wants to do.
[02:55:23.498 --> 02:55:24.358]  I don't know.
[02:55:25.238 --> 02:55:32.661]  And then after weeks of this, I decided to just tell you, just know I'm at the limits of my capacity.
[02:55:33.741 --> 02:55:38.442]  I'm not like these con men that say they know everything and they've got every answer and they have no answers.
[02:55:38.902 --> 02:55:40.243]  I'm telling you, I'm maxed out.
[02:55:41.331 --> 02:55:43.113]  And I'm just telling you this stuff's real.
[02:55:44.215 --> 02:55:47.579]  And that's all I've got at this point, is the fact that I'm real.
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:50.162]  I can hold on to that point, that I'm
[02:55:53.138 --> 02:56:03.285]  That I love my family, that I love children, that I want to be a good person, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that we continue on, and I want to be strong, because I believe you're strong.
[02:56:03.725 --> 02:56:06.167]  Globalists always say, oh Alex, you're just scaring them for us.
[02:56:06.407 --> 02:56:07.268]  They're a bunch of cowards.
[02:56:07.928 --> 02:56:10.270]  But they've been proven wrong, haven't they?
[02:56:10.470 --> 02:56:11.671]  You're not a bunch of cowards.
[02:56:11.731 --> 02:56:15.133]  You heard the truth about the globalists, and you took action.
[02:56:15.654 --> 02:56:18.395]  You heard the truth about their evil, and you took action.
[02:56:18.836 --> 02:56:19.896]  And that's what I know.
[02:56:20.837 --> 02:56:27.023]  I don't sit there in some intellectual calculation like all these other inbred, three-barreled names, scumbags do.
[02:56:27.524 --> 02:56:30.647]  You want to talk about cracker-ass white people, let me tell you, they are the problem.
[02:56:30.887 --> 02:56:32.108]  They're one-tenth of one percent.
[02:56:32.128 --> 02:56:33.529]  They're a bunch of inbred mental patients.
[02:56:34.030 --> 02:56:35.191]  They can all go right to hell.
[02:56:36.252 --> 02:56:38.715]  There's no big fancy calculation with me.
[02:56:39.195 --> 02:56:42.778]  I go with what the truth is, though the heavens fall.
[02:56:44.059 --> 02:56:49.820]  And in one minute at the end of the hour, if you want to see this type of information continue, buy the products.
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:52.461]  50% off, it's going to end this weekend.
[02:56:53.321 --> 02:56:59.982]  Silver Blue, Colloidal Silver, Iodine Fortified, the Icarin Liver and Kidney Cleanse, so powerful.
[02:57:00.002 --> 02:57:01.402]  50% off, out of the gates.
[02:57:02.503 --> 02:57:05.043]  And of course, the Body's Ultimate Tumoring Formula.
[02:57:05.063 --> 02:57:07.183]  50% off, 400 plus milligrams.
[02:57:11.633 --> 02:57:12.794]  There's nothing procriminoid in it.
[02:57:13.334 --> 02:57:14.455]  Nobody's got that out there.
[02:57:14.475 --> 02:57:15.916]  There's brands out there for 80 bucks.
[02:57:16.656 --> 02:57:20.979]  Two or three times we've sold a four that are pure crap because I'm a schmuck.
[02:57:21.979 --> 02:57:24.921]  I believe in actually treating you like I want to be treated.
[02:57:24.941 --> 02:57:25.341]  Well, you know what?
[02:57:25.361 --> 02:57:26.021]  I'm not a schmuck.
[02:57:26.642 --> 02:57:27.302]  You have seen it.
[02:57:27.362 --> 02:57:28.043]  You have used it.
[02:57:28.423 --> 02:57:34.847]  You have buying it and you're rebuying it because you know that there are real people that openly deal and straight shoot.
[02:57:37.423 --> 02:57:38.244]  Lay it out square.
[02:57:39.404 --> 02:57:40.565]  New term I developed this week.
[02:57:40.665 --> 02:57:41.206]  Square shoot.
[02:57:42.126 --> 02:57:42.766]  I shoot you straight.
[02:57:43.367 --> 02:57:43.867]  Square way.
[02:57:44.948 --> 02:57:45.508]  Square shooting.
[02:57:45.728 --> 02:57:46.088]  We'll be back.
[02:57:46.108 --> 02:57:46.469]  Stay with us.
[02:57:46.769 --> 02:57:59.837]  Fourth hour.
[02:57:59.857 --> 02:58:00.357]  Just briefly.
[02:58:01.565 --> 02:58:03.586]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[02:58:03.606 --> 02:58:04.487]  He's about to retire.
[02:58:04.507 --> 02:58:11.571]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[02:58:11.611 --> 02:58:14.592]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[02:58:14.632 --> 02:58:15.613]  That's a bunch of bull.
[02:58:16.133 --> 02:58:17.194]  You need fluoride or you die.
[02:58:17.214 --> 02:58:20.236]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[02:58:20.256 --> 02:58:21.036]  He said, this is incredible.
[02:58:21.456 --> 02:58:23.437]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[02:58:23.477 --> 02:58:29.381]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[02:58:29.961 --> 02:58:30.441]  Exactly.
[02:58:30.501 --> 02:58:36.484]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[02:58:36.544 --> 02:58:40.326]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said, reduce it in water by half.
[02:58:41.686 --> 02:58:45.208]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[02:58:46.203 --> 02:58:46.623]  I don't
[02:59:02.998 --> 02:59:06.560]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age 6 with it.
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:08.221]  Why does it say nursery water?
[02:59:08.241 --> 02:59:09.462]  They're at the store with added fluoride.
[02:59:09.522 --> 02:59:12.424]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[02:59:12.464 --> 02:59:14.445]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:59:14.645 --> 02:59:24.391]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Tom's of Maine, it's private labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[02:59:24.952 --> 02:59:26.192]  But you die without iodine.
[02:59:26.212 --> 02:59:27.773]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[02:59:28.194 --> 02:59:29.554]  You drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[02:59:29.594 --> 02:59:30.515]  That's a different type of iodine.
[02:59:30.555 --> 02:59:31.936]  This is the real medical grade.
[02:59:32.376 --> 02:59:40.703]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[02:59:41.283 --> 02:59:44.646]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[02:59:51.912 --> 02:59:57.837]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:13.724 --> 03:00:17.472]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:00:17.792 --> 03:00:22.001]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:26.235 --> 03:00:33.659]  I want to be very, very clear, and it's not because I'm in some FBI butt-kissing operation, but because I've learned how this stuff works.
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:51.249]  The Democrats would stage riots, came out in the WikiLeaks, came out in other documents, Soros documents in court, we covered just last month, would exacerbate every questionable police shooting, would cause race riots, would try to discredit local governments,
[03:00:52.421 --> 03:00:55.202]  To then bring in federal control under U.N.
[03:00:55.422 --> 03:00:57.843]  edict under the Strong Cities Initiative.
[03:00:59.343 --> 03:01:05.185]  And believe me, I couldn't believe two years ago when they were openly saying the Justice Department, Loretta Lynch, wanted the U.N.
[03:01:05.565 --> 03:01:06.886]  to take over local police departments.
[03:01:06.906 --> 03:01:09.486]  I mean, you can't make that up, but that was the announcements.
[03:01:10.007 --> 03:01:11.347]  Even crazier than I can think of.
[03:01:11.407 --> 03:01:14.208]  I mean, it's just they're getting bold as they lose.
[03:01:14.228 --> 03:01:15.728]  They're, like, overshooting.
[03:01:15.748 --> 03:01:17.529]  They used to, like, deny world government.
[03:01:17.589 --> 03:01:20.730]  Now it's like, World Government Summit says get rid of the family, you know, this week.
[03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:35.848]  So when you just sit there and like attack a group and say every FBI agent's a horrible person and they're all bad and blah blah blah, you know there's a political aim behind that because it's an institution.
[03:01:36.709 --> 03:01:38.790]  Somebody wants to hijack that institution.
[03:01:39.851 --> 03:01:43.713]  And if Trump was trying to clearly block the FBI and do bad things, I'd be against him.
[03:01:44.914 --> 03:01:53.080]  But there are criminal elements of the FBI, so they make it about an attack on the FBI instead of about ferreting out criminal elements within it.
[03:01:56.254 --> 03:02:15.109]  But if the left and the globalists are going to call for gun control, they're going to blame gun owners and say we're all guilty, and then you've got the holdovers of the whole Obama FBI not doing anything about people that keep wanting to do mass shootings, Islamic attacks, San Bernardino, FBI agents were threatened with arrest, civil rights, criminal investigations.
[03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:19.193]  Because they were trying to stop people that went to Pakistan and went to Saudi Arabia.
[03:02:19.473 --> 03:02:24.658]  Those were FBI agents and federal marshals that tried to do their jobs.
[03:02:25.099 --> 03:02:38.332]  They were threatened with criminal charges for civil rights violations, like they were KKK members about to blow up a black church for trying to stop Muslim immigrants that were terrorists and later did attack a Christmas party.
[03:02:40.339 --> 03:02:41.740]  So am I saying the FBI's the enemy?
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:46.203]  No, it was the FBI low-level trying to stop it.
[03:02:46.584 --> 03:02:51.247]  It was Justice Department above it making it a political operation completely.
[03:02:52.648 --> 03:02:54.109]  That said, here's the breaking news.
[03:02:54.569 --> 03:02:55.890]  It's out of London Independent.
[03:02:56.371 --> 03:02:57.652]  It's out of Sputnik News.
[03:02:57.672 --> 03:02:58.552]  It's out of AP.
[03:02:59.073 --> 03:03:07.539]  Florida governor calls for FBI director's resignation over missed shooters tip on YouTube, you name it.
[03:03:09.011 --> 03:03:17.996]  Florida Governor Rick Scott called for the resignation of FBI Director Christopher Wray on Friday after the agency admitted that the January tip regarding Nicholas Cruz was non-investigated.
[03:03:18.436 --> 03:03:31.243]  The announcement comes after the FBI admitted on Friday that a person close to Cruz connected the agency's public access line to report their concerns about the 19-year-old's gun ownership, desire to kill people, and iraq behavior, disturbing social media posts.
[03:03:31.263 --> 03:03:34.345]  Yeah, he called himself the school shooter.
[03:03:36.496 --> 03:03:39.777]  There was some weird guy with guns at a school and my kids went there.
[03:03:40.337 --> 03:03:43.578]  He called himself, Hi, Mr. Jones, I'm the school shooter.
[03:03:44.338 --> 03:03:45.058]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[03:03:45.298 --> 03:03:47.879]  I mean, you're 19 year old, you're getting your ass kicked.
[03:03:47.919 --> 03:03:49.599]  I'm not saying I attack macho, man.
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:52.460]  You walk over and say, I'm going to shoot your kid.
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:53.921]  What the hell?
[03:03:55.901 --> 03:04:02.703]  But that's where we are in this country with the leftists and the globalists protecting Islamists, the schizophrenics, you name it, it never ends.
[03:04:05.783 --> 03:04:07.005]  So we'll continue to cover that.
[03:04:07.165 --> 03:04:17.679]  Coming up, we've got the guest host here, Joel Gilbert, Larry Klayman, founder of Judicial Watch, heading up his own powerful group now with the latest intel on everything that's happening.
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:19.222]  It's all coming up.
[03:04:20.310 --> 03:04:30.254]  On the other side of this quick one-minute break, I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and I know you're awake.
[03:04:30.794 --> 03:04:31.935]  Hell, you're more awake than I am.
[03:04:32.755 --> 03:04:42.819]  But if you don't spread the links to the articles, if you don't spread the word, if you don't paint InfoWars on the side of your bar or put a sticker on the back of your truck, if you don't call a talk radio or C-SPAN and plug it, they'll beat us.
[03:04:43.539 --> 03:04:45.040]  And if they can beat us, they can beat you.
[03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:45.920]  But you know what?
[03:04:46.240 --> 03:04:47.921]  We keep winning because you keep taking action.
[03:04:48.541 --> 03:04:52.903]  So I'm telling the football team in the fourth quarter, it's already 20 points ahead.
[03:04:53.424 --> 03:04:54.004]  Great job.
[03:04:54.064 --> 03:04:55.304]  Let's not just lose this.
[03:04:55.765 --> 03:04:58.126]  I commend you all, but it's up to us to lose.
[03:04:58.546 --> 03:04:59.426]  It's ours to lose.
[03:04:59.686 --> 03:05:00.347]  Let's take it in.
[03:05:01.187 --> 03:05:05.930]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[03:05:06.190 --> 03:05:11.714]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[03:05:11.834 --> 03:05:17.098]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there.
[03:05:17.118 --> 03:05:20.880]  We're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:28.866]  So go to fortifiedsupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[03:05:28.966 --> 03:05:30.927]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.
[03:05:31.627 --> 03:05:38.849]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:05:39.329 --> 03:05:48.472]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[03:05:48.752 --> 03:05:53.853]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[03:05:54.133 --> 03:05:56.974]  It also funds the InfoWars, a total 360 win.
[03:05:57.394 --> 03:06:00.015]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:06:02.794 --> 03:06:03.934]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:06:04.055 --> 03:06:04.735]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:04.875 --> 03:06:05.576]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:05.656 --> 03:06:06.256]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:06.416 --> 03:06:09.299]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[03:06:09.459 --> 03:06:18.906]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:06:18.926 --> 03:06:20.668]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:06:26.202 --> 03:06:30.666]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[03:06:30.786 --> 03:06:33.369]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[03:06:33.449 --> 03:06:36.291]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[03:06:36.431 --> 03:06:37.693]  It just pancaked.
[03:06:37.853 --> 03:06:41.956]  It took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:06:43.277 --> 03:06:45.218]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[03:06:45.278 --> 03:06:52.302]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[03:06:52.322 --> 03:06:52.582]  U.S.A.
[03:06:52.682 --> 03:06:55.704]  Is this global governance at last?
[03:06:55.824 --> 03:06:56.784]  Is it one world?
[03:06:56.825 --> 03:06:58.385]  The central bank is in charge.
[03:06:58.405 --> 03:07:00.847]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[03:07:00.867 --> 03:07:01.407]  Some former U.S.
[03:07:01.467 --> 03:07:03.608]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[03:07:03.788 --> 03:07:07.010]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[03:07:07.310 --> 03:07:12.855]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[03:07:12.935 --> 03:07:14.196]  Russian, stop!
[03:07:14.437 --> 03:07:15.237]  Denied everything.
[03:07:15.277 --> 03:07:16.599]  He called it all fake news.
[03:07:16.779 --> 03:07:19.501]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[03:07:19.521 --> 03:07:21.823]  This is a national emergency.
[03:07:21.924 --> 03:07:27.369]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[03:07:27.449 --> 03:07:29.731]  This is a FEMA high-level emergency.
[03:07:30.511 --> 03:07:32.653]  We are at war with Russia.
[03:07:33.033 --> 03:07:38.557]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[03:07:38.737 --> 03:07:41.719]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[03:07:41.739 --> 03:07:43.440]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[03:07:44.541 --> 03:07:48.423]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:07:49.304 --> 03:07:50.925]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:07:54.395 --> 03:07:55.956]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:56.036 --> 03:08:00.339]  I'm Joel Gilbert, coming to you from California, right from the left coast.
[03:08:01.119 --> 03:08:10.025]  You know me as a frequent guest, filmmaker, dreams from my real father, there's no place like Utopia, and right now in the InfoWars store, you gotta buy it from Alex Jones.
[03:08:10.165 --> 03:08:12.226]  It's Trump, the art of the insult.
[03:08:12.987 --> 03:08:14.628]  You won't be able to stop laughing.
[03:08:15.208 --> 03:08:18.410]  You gotta go to the InfoWars store and get the art of the insult.
[03:08:19.131 --> 03:08:20.872]  Now, coming up at the bottom of the hour,
[03:08:21.696 --> 03:08:49.034]  Clinton basher attorney Larry Klayman of Freedom Watch USA He's going to be giving us a lot of insight on what's going to happen next in Washington with the so-called indictments or Non-indictments if anything's going to happen and how it can happen to take care of these conspirators against the United States First I'm going to give you some some of my insights some of my takes on what's going on in the news Briefly because we're going to talk to Larry Klayman later.
[03:08:49.054 --> 03:08:51.296]  I want to talk about something
[03:08:52.270 --> 03:08:54.051]  Personal about the Steele dossier.
[03:08:54.991 --> 03:08:56.892]  Of course, we all read about Bruce Orr.
[03:08:57.052 --> 03:09:00.474]  People have seen Bruce Orr in the news quite a bit.
[03:09:00.534 --> 03:09:02.375]  His wife worked for Fusion GPS.
[03:09:02.395 --> 03:09:03.715]  She was a Russia expert.
[03:09:04.276 --> 03:09:05.356]  And he's knee-deep in it.
[03:09:05.956 --> 03:09:07.937]  Well, I actually went to high school with Bruce Orr.
[03:09:08.477 --> 03:09:09.718]  There's that high school photo.
[03:09:10.278 --> 03:09:11.659]  And I knew Bruce Orr growing up.
[03:09:12.259 --> 03:09:14.560]  He came from my small town in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
[03:09:15.601 --> 03:09:16.941]  Bruce was a nice enough guy.
[03:09:17.682 --> 03:09:20.383]  And the reason I'm telling you this is because he was a brainiac.
[03:09:21.010 --> 03:09:25.473]  He was an A-plus student physics major in college.
[03:09:26.874 --> 03:09:28.135]  He was not an ideologue.
[03:09:28.295 --> 03:09:30.296]  He was not a political person.
[03:09:30.396 --> 03:09:32.297]  If I'm being honest, he was a little bit of a wimp.
[03:09:32.958 --> 03:09:42.244]  So I'm going to predict, based on my knowledge and experience with Bruce Ohr growing up, that he's probably cooperating with the
[03:09:43.866 --> 03:09:51.310]  With the investigators because he was actually scheduled to be interviewed by the House committee over a month ago, no interview.
[03:09:52.030 --> 03:09:53.771]  And I think that's very interesting.
[03:09:54.371 --> 03:09:56.832]  I think his personality is someone who's going to cooperate.
[03:09:57.593 --> 03:10:05.857]  If anything, it was his wife, Nellie, I think that got him into this nonsense because we saw how much she's involved with Russia.
[03:10:05.917 --> 03:10:06.998]  She spent time in Russia.
[03:10:07.018 --> 03:10:07.758]  She learned Russian.
[03:10:08.760 --> 03:10:14.565]  And in my experience, people that become so obsessed with Russia is very strange and very rare group of people that do that.
[03:10:15.346 --> 03:10:19.389]  And the only people that do that are essentially what we call Red Diaper Babies.
[03:10:19.930 --> 03:10:25.255]  Red Diaper Babies are children of Communists, children of Communist Party USA members.
[03:10:26.315 --> 03:10:29.138]  It's a phenomenon that goes way back in the 1960s.
[03:10:29.678 --> 03:10:35.924]  All the leaders of the Weather Underground, SDS, Students for Democratic Society, Marxist terrorist groups,
[03:10:36.644 --> 03:10:46.587]  All of them came from families where their parents taught them growing up, we're pro-Stalin, we're pro-communist, we love Russia, America is evil.
[03:10:47.288 --> 03:10:48.248]  This is the nonsense.
[03:10:48.288 --> 03:10:51.409]  These people were fed and then they grow up having an obsession with Russia.
[03:10:52.650 --> 03:11:02.433]  As you know from my film, Dreams from My Real Father, I presented a mountain of evidence that Obama's real father was a Soviet agent, Frank Marshall Davis, the man who raised him in Hawaii.
[03:11:03.619 --> 03:11:05.119]  And he was radicalized.
[03:11:05.699 --> 03:11:11.100]  Now Bruce Orr, I believe, is going to sing to the feds because he's no radical.
[03:11:11.681 --> 03:11:18.762]  He's a very nice kid and he probably got involved in some things that he realizes, you know, are way over his head.
[03:11:18.822 --> 03:11:23.443]  So we're going to talk to Larry Klayman about that later at the bottom of the hour.
[03:11:24.083 --> 03:11:29.524]  I want to give you some insights into this horrific shooting by this nut job in Florida this week.
[03:11:30.755 --> 03:11:35.019]  As usual, we hear that the FBI was warned about this guy and did nothing.
[03:11:35.920 --> 03:11:38.302]  And of course, the left calls for gun restrictions.
[03:11:38.342 --> 03:11:40.484]  They call this common sense.
[03:11:40.544 --> 03:11:42.206]  It's always common sense with the left.
[03:11:42.226 --> 03:11:43.407]  They use these word games.
[03:11:45.028 --> 03:11:46.830]  They want common sense gun laws.
[03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:48.892]  Of course, there were no common sense truck laws.
[03:11:49.597 --> 03:11:56.199]  When the terrorists ran over people in New York or anywhere else, when these people are on a bike path.
[03:11:56.959 --> 03:12:04.180]  They didn't talk about common sense pressure cooker laws after the Tsarnaev brothers made bombs out of pressure cookers.
[03:12:05.241 --> 03:12:14.823]  Every time an Islamic terrorist shoots, stabs, bombs, or runs over Americans, of course the response of the left is, let's not jump to conclusions.
[03:12:15.976 --> 03:12:20.219]  There's no common sense call for common sense immigration reform.
[03:12:20.639 --> 03:12:22.060]  Where's the common sense?
[03:12:22.520 --> 03:12:24.822]  So you got to be careful about leftist word games.
[03:12:24.862 --> 03:12:31.286]  They've been playing word games forever because on the face of it, their policies don't make any sense.
[03:12:32.006 --> 03:12:32.707]  Of course, back in the 60s,
[03:12:34.031 --> 03:12:38.954]  They used to say, don't kill your children, and then it became choice.
[03:12:39.054 --> 03:12:40.634]  Abortion was a matter of choice.
[03:12:41.315 --> 03:12:47.018]  Of course, only eight, nine years ago, Barack Obama was saying, marriage is between a man and a woman and God.
[03:12:47.138 --> 03:12:47.958]  God's in the mix.
[03:12:49.039 --> 03:12:51.560]  And then later he said, well, no, now the word is equality.
[03:12:51.580 --> 03:12:52.721]  It's marriage equality.
[03:12:52.941 --> 03:12:57.183]  So we've got common sense, choice, and equality.
[03:12:58.022 --> 03:13:00.405]  The next one is government controlled health care.
[03:13:00.846 --> 03:13:02.688]  Government controlled doctors.
[03:13:02.848 --> 03:13:04.050]  Doctors work for the government.
[03:13:04.070 --> 03:13:05.952]  We see how that works in the VA hospitals.
[03:13:06.733 --> 03:13:08.154]  But the new word is access.
[03:13:08.215 --> 03:13:10.257]  You have to have access to health care.
[03:13:10.718 --> 03:13:11.879]  Everyone has to have access.
[03:13:11.919 --> 03:13:15.023]  Now access simply means free government health care.
[03:13:15.683 --> 03:13:16.725]  And now of course we hear
[03:13:17.857 --> 03:13:25.559]  Because this nutjob shot people that we need common sense gun reform, which simply means eliminate, of course, the Second Amendment.
[03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:30.801]  So the media simply in turn replays and repeats these word games.
[03:13:31.461 --> 03:13:33.962]  And often Republicans accidentally get caught up in it too.
[03:13:34.002 --> 03:13:35.282]  They repeat these word games.
[03:13:35.783 --> 03:13:40.624]  So you have to be very vigilant not to accidentally accept the language of the left.
[03:13:41.224 --> 03:13:43.625]  All these things, the immigration system is broken.
[03:13:44.392 --> 03:13:45.633]  I've heard Republicans say that.
[03:13:46.194 --> 03:13:48.315]  In fact, the immigration system was fine.
[03:13:48.415 --> 03:13:50.137]  It was the enforcement that was broken.
[03:13:50.997 --> 03:13:53.319]  So it's all about word games when it comes to the left.
[03:13:54.580 --> 03:13:59.584]  But let's talk about the FBI and their incompetence with this mass shooter.
[03:14:00.725 --> 03:14:02.767]  They've been missing a lot of mass shooters lately.
[03:14:02.787 --> 03:14:06.990]  I want to go through some of them and give you some insights, especially into Las Vegas.
[03:14:07.811 --> 03:14:12.695]  Of course, Dylann Roof bought weapons because of errors of the FBI and their background checks.
[03:14:13.737 --> 03:14:21.222]  Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Hassan was in contact with Al Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki.
[03:14:21.823 --> 03:14:23.764]  FBI declined to investigate him.
[03:14:24.024 --> 03:14:25.165]  Nothing could go wrong there.
[03:14:26.025 --> 03:14:31.069]  Of course, the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston, one of them was investigated by the FBI.
[03:14:31.789 --> 03:14:33.370]  They said, no links to terrorism.
[03:14:33.390 --> 03:14:33.891]  See you later.
[03:14:35.472 --> 03:14:39.595]  Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen was turned into the FBI.
[03:14:39.635 --> 03:14:41.496]  Remember, if you see something, say something.
[03:14:42.168 --> 03:14:44.230]  They had like a two-year investigation of this guy.
[03:14:44.270 --> 03:14:45.010]  They interviewed him.
[03:14:45.651 --> 03:14:47.172]  They eventually said, well, no problem.
[03:14:48.173 --> 03:14:48.694]  Never mind.
[03:14:49.354 --> 03:14:51.936]  And then after he shoots up the nightclub, they lecture us again.
[03:14:51.976 --> 03:14:53.418]  If you see something, say something.
[03:14:54.018 --> 03:14:56.460]  Well, that entire idea is completely irrelevant.
[03:14:56.500 --> 03:14:57.781]  It's been proven over and over.
[03:14:58.882 --> 03:14:59.663]  It's not going to help.
[03:14:59.863 --> 03:15:06.348]  A better slogan would be, be prepared to protect yourself because the FBI ain't going to do it.
[03:15:07.189 --> 03:15:08.070]  FBI ain't going to do it.
[03:15:09.890 --> 03:15:12.131]  What has the FBI been doing lately?
[03:15:13.052 --> 03:15:20.015]  We know they spend their time carrying bags of money to Russian hoaxsters who are offering up short stories about Donald Trump.
[03:15:21.156 --> 03:15:23.177]  Biggest racket in the world.
[03:15:23.277 --> 03:15:25.578]  They're paying about $85,000 per page.
[03:15:25.618 --> 03:15:27.559]  That's what they paid for the Steele dossier.
[03:15:28.739 --> 03:15:30.880]  FBI is also leaking about Donald Trump.
[03:15:31.221 --> 03:15:33.982]  Even the director of the FBI leaking about Donald Trump.
[03:15:34.442 --> 03:15:35.903]  Not looking into these guys.
[03:15:36.926 --> 03:15:37.908]  On these watch lists.
[03:15:38.328 --> 03:15:40.331]  And of course they're apparently texting each other.
[03:15:40.351 --> 03:15:41.192]  That's another big deal.
[03:15:41.753 --> 03:15:48.944]  So I'm going to talk more in depth about the Las Vegas shooter and some things that I've learned and how the FBI goes into the mix.
[03:15:49.525 --> 03:15:50.807]  We'll be right back after the break.
[03:16:02.109 --> 03:16:04.511]  Our latest product, by the way, is Immunewall.
[03:16:05.252 --> 03:16:07.353]  It's very, very affordable at $29.95.
[03:16:07.954 --> 03:16:09.795]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[03:16:10.336 --> 03:16:16.420]  And we set out with beta-glucans, olive leaf, and a bunch of other key compounds that are absolutely documented.
[03:16:16.460 --> 03:16:20.683]  We can even make claims about what this does to
[03:16:21.684 --> 03:16:27.687]  Bolster your immune system and make you healthier, especially if you're going to be traveling, or you're under stress, or it's in the winter months.
[03:16:28.247 --> 03:16:30.508]  This is something everybody should be taking.
[03:16:30.568 --> 03:16:35.530]  Wellmune is patented and documented in all the hundreds of studies.
[03:16:36.451 --> 03:16:37.411]  And then you got the ancient.
[03:16:37.631 --> 03:16:43.216]  That stuff there as well, the organic olive leaf extract is what the Roman soldiers would take whenever they started getting sick.
[03:16:43.636 --> 03:16:47.080]  Just chop full of all those key enzymes and vitamin C and so much more.
[03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:53.585]  Then it's got all the concentrated highest quality organic types of mushrooms that are documented for your body.
[03:16:53.626 --> 03:16:58.970]  And then concentrated citrus peel, orange peel, lemon peel, organic orange peel.
[03:17:00.472 --> 03:17:03.635]  It's all there ladies and gentlemen and I'm not going to sit here and hype this product up.
[03:17:04.775 --> 03:17:07.556]  So whether it's the sleep aid knockout you need, which is amazing.
[03:17:07.716 --> 03:17:10.698]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle.
[03:17:10.778 --> 03:17:12.178]  And a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:17:12.519 --> 03:17:16.841]  And I said, I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much are you in that?
[03:17:17.461 --> 03:17:23.784]  They said on average about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:17:25.182 --> 03:17:38.905]  And I said, so, I can put the same amount of melatonin in, it's making a bigger capsule that's powdered, see, I should absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and several other things.
[03:17:39.265 --> 03:17:44.586]  And I checked the scientists, none of them interact badly, they're all from nature, they're all healthy, they all have good, you know, good clean records.
[03:17:44.866 --> 03:17:47.747]  And then you get a sleep unlike other systems, I mean, I...
[03:17:48.809 --> 03:17:53.372]  Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[03:17:53.412 --> 03:17:54.973]  He writes the Texas Law Family Code.
[03:17:54.993 --> 03:17:56.874]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:17:56.894 --> 03:17:58.755]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:17:59.315 --> 03:18:01.697]  You know, doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink.
[03:18:02.837 --> 03:18:04.458]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:18:04.979 --> 03:18:06.580]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:18:06.600 --> 03:18:08.601]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:18:09.815 --> 03:18:12.959]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:18:12.979 --> 03:18:13.860]  This is insane.
[03:18:14.301 --> 03:18:15.222]  Wow, it's incredible.
[03:18:15.262 --> 03:18:17.304]  I've taken melatonin stuff by itself and it didn't help.
[03:18:17.825 --> 03:18:18.666]  Wow, this is incredible.
[03:18:18.967 --> 03:18:20.048]  And I said, yeah, I don't know.
[03:18:20.088 --> 03:18:25.054]  I just had the idea to mix everything known, you know, scientifically and in the wives' tales together to make you sleep.
[03:18:25.154 --> 03:18:26.075]  And, you know, it's powerful.
[03:18:26.736 --> 03:18:27.877]  And they're all game changers.
[03:18:27.917 --> 03:18:32.739]  You need to really go read the third-party reviews or power reviews and others that we have linked.
[03:18:33.359 --> 03:18:38.221]  Our average review on InfoWareStore.com, there's more than 40,000 reviews now, is at 94%.
[03:18:41.505 --> 03:18:46.807]  They even had media investigations with BuzzFeed and people calling them, going, we want to see it, it must be fake.
[03:18:46.827 --> 03:18:49.107]  They're like, no, it's really real.
[03:18:50.368 --> 03:18:54.209]  So they've had campaigns that people go on there and try to vote stuff down.
[03:18:54.249 --> 03:18:58.230]  I mean, they are just so angry where they test our stuff and test it and test it.
[03:18:58.290 --> 03:19:04.052]  California labs that has stuff nine times higher than EU that has the next highest standards.
[03:19:04.372 --> 03:19:10.398]  I mean, basically, there's more lead in the air in California than you can, quote, put in a supplement or any other product, unless you call it a food product.
[03:19:10.718 --> 03:19:13.181]  But 60-something of our products are all California standard.
[03:19:13.201 --> 03:19:18.586]  But if you've got something that's got, I don't know, 10, 15 ingredients in it, and it's also a large serving like Caveman?
[03:19:18.907 --> 03:19:21.509]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, any can of chicken noodle soup.
[03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:25.031]  Has probably five times the lead California says is allowed.
[03:19:25.171 --> 03:19:25.891]  It's just insane.
[03:19:25.911 --> 03:19:29.472]  And then we test and test and test more than anybody we know of because we know.
[03:19:29.492 --> 03:19:31.913]  Now we're under a microscope, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:32.433 --> 03:19:34.653]  But thank you for committing to get the great products.
[03:19:34.994 --> 03:19:36.534]  The books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:19:36.874 --> 03:19:39.535]  Because it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:19:39.555 --> 03:19:42.596]  We're not like, it's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films.
[03:19:43.236 --> 03:19:46.357]  And you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:19:46.377 --> 03:19:49.497]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:19:49.838 --> 03:19:51.138]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:19:53.106 --> 03:19:55.409]  That's available at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:55.449 --> 03:19:57.132]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.651 --> 03:20:26.853]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:20:27.513 --> 03:20:29.074]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:31.515 --> 03:20:33.596]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:33.776 --> 03:20:36.878]  Infowars Joel Gilbert coming to you right from the left coast.
[03:20:37.518 --> 03:20:47.403]  At the bottom of the hour, attorney Larry Klayman, Clinton basher, legal scholar, and a voice against government corruption.
[03:20:47.423 --> 03:20:49.704]  We're going to talk to him about what's going on in the FBI.
[03:20:50.445 --> 03:20:51.065]  In the meantime,
[03:20:51.864 --> 03:21:10.840]  I ended the last segment saying, instead of, if you see something, say something, the better slogan is, be prepared to protect yourself, because the FBI is clearly preoccupied with an obsession on Donald Trump, and they are not protecting people as they easily could.
[03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:14.103]  I want to talk about the Las Vegas shooter, Steven Paddock.
[03:21:15.164 --> 03:21:17.405]  Now, this is a strange case.
[03:21:18.647 --> 03:21:28.316]  A rich, retired white guy, regular old dude, decides to give it all up and murder 59 or so country music fans.
[03:21:29.057 --> 03:21:29.958]  What are the odds of that?
[03:21:30.238 --> 03:21:31.119]  And there's no motive.
[03:21:31.899 --> 03:21:32.840]  Lots of strange things.
[03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:33.421]  No motive.
[03:21:33.781 --> 03:21:36.163]  There's hundreds of cameras in the Mandalay Bay.
[03:21:36.764 --> 03:21:42.069]  They must have had this guy coming and going with bags of stuff and suitcases full of guns or something.
[03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:44.311]  How come we haven't seen a videotape?
[03:21:45.385 --> 03:21:47.646]  Anyone seen a video, a tape of that?
[03:21:48.126 --> 03:21:52.508]  There was only one witness, which was a security guard, who goes to Mexico.
[03:21:52.528 --> 03:21:57.751]  The FBI lets him go to Mexico a few days later, and then a week later he's on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.
[03:21:59.252 --> 03:22:04.194]  You know, could it be that a different guy came back from Mexico, and there's something else going on?
[03:22:04.794 --> 03:22:08.716]  As long as there's no information, you have to wonder what's happening.
[03:22:08.756 --> 03:22:11.858]  Now, I called a source, a good friend of mine who was a
[03:22:13.081 --> 03:22:24.724]  Retired military guy, very high up in the US military, retired in Vegas for many years, and he checked for me with the top security officials, police, even FBI, in Las Vegas.
[03:22:25.385 --> 03:22:30.286]  And he said that these main security people, who usually know everything, knew nothing.
[03:22:30.966 --> 03:22:33.147]  They knew nothing and they usually know everything.
[03:22:33.907 --> 03:22:38.248]  And they said that it seemed like all the information was blocked up from the top.
[03:22:39.049 --> 03:22:39.809]  So you have to ask,
[03:22:40.430 --> 03:22:41.631]  You know, what really happened?
[03:22:41.671 --> 03:22:44.452]  Now remember, the FBI screwed up in Orlando, Florida.
[03:22:44.492 --> 03:22:48.853]  They had this guy, Omar Mateen, under surveillance for two years and dropped the ball.
[03:22:49.614 --> 03:22:50.534]  49 people dead.
[03:22:51.134 --> 03:22:52.355]  That was pretty embarrassing.
[03:22:53.635 --> 03:22:55.516]  There was a similar story in Manchester.
[03:22:56.156 --> 03:23:03.019]  The shooter, Salman Abedi, at the Ariana Grande concert in England, she was under surveillance and they let him go.
[03:23:03.599 --> 03:23:06.221]  I'm sorry, he was under surveillance and the Brits let him go.
[03:23:06.281 --> 03:23:07.261]  That was pretty embarrassing.
[03:23:08.624 --> 03:23:13.946]  So it's a pattern that we see in Vegas, except they didn't maybe tell us what really went down.
[03:23:15.026 --> 03:23:19.928]  Now, I would bet one day we're going to find out that Steven Paddock was under surveillance.
[03:23:20.928 --> 03:23:28.851]  What if all that video in the hotel that they're not showing us, what if there were FBI guys helping him carry guns up to the room?
[03:23:29.231 --> 03:23:32.412]  They certainly wouldn't want to show you that if they screwed up and let him go.
[03:23:33.813 --> 03:23:36.694]  When they cut off the information flow, it means there's something wrong.
[03:23:38.429 --> 03:23:39.870]  What if Paddock was moonlighting?
[03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:49.474]  What if he was working with the FBI trying to set up some ISIS character and the ISIS guy did all the shooting and killed Paddock and left?
[03:23:50.535 --> 03:23:54.556]  Remember, the FBI has cut off all the information.
[03:23:55.577 --> 03:23:57.378]  We know there's corruption in the FBI.
[03:23:57.818 --> 03:24:00.719]  These guys get short stories from Russians and
[03:24:01.468 --> 03:24:05.169]  That are ridiculous and they say, oh, let's go open up an investigation on Donald Trump.
[03:24:05.530 --> 03:24:14.933]  So the point is the FBI seems hopelessly corrupt and incapable on all levels of executing protection for Americans.
[03:24:15.353 --> 03:24:20.495]  So this see something, say something is quite irrelevant.
[03:24:20.635 --> 03:24:21.276]  Doesn't matter.
[03:24:22.176 --> 03:24:27.098]  Be prepared to protect yourself because the FBI hasn't proven that they're ever going to do that.
[03:24:28.572 --> 03:24:31.294]  Next thing I want to give my take is on Iran.
[03:24:31.955 --> 03:24:43.543]  We saw in North Korea, of course, was in the news at the Olympics because Kim Jong-un's little sister really, really impressed the media because she showed up, said nothing, and hardly even smiled.
[03:24:44.204 --> 03:24:45.905]  And the media thought that was really cool.
[03:24:46.706 --> 03:24:51.329]  So I want to give you a unique take on North Korea that you probably haven't heard.
[03:24:51.749 --> 03:24:53.771]  Everyone knows about Obama's deal with Iran.
[03:24:54.474 --> 03:25:01.656]  It was a private deal, it was not approved by the Senate as required, and it included the transfer of 1.7 billion dollars in cash.
[03:25:02.536 --> 03:25:07.777]  Now, the media likes to say, well, some of this might have gone to terrorism, but I would argue much worse.
[03:25:08.697 --> 03:25:12.878]  Did you notice that the Korean, North Korean nuclear program suddenly took off?
[03:25:13.839 --> 03:25:19.880]  They're suddenly shooting all these missiles and exploding nuclear bombs as soon as Iran got this cash.
[03:25:20.859 --> 03:25:29.761]  So, unfortunately, the real story that was broken by a reporter, Claudia Rosette, who told me about this, I met her, and she wrote about it in Forbes Magazine.
[03:25:30.681 --> 03:25:39.863]  She said that Iran did not need cash, that the entire point of the agreement with Obama was to allow Iran access to international banking.
[03:25:40.963 --> 03:25:45.884]  She even told me that Iran didn't even ask for cash until the very end.
[03:25:47.352 --> 03:25:53.276]  And she told me that there's only one country in the world, one country that must use cash to do transactions.
[03:25:53.696 --> 03:25:55.217]  And that one country is North Korea.
[03:25:56.638 --> 03:26:02.941]  So again, did you notice that the North Korean nuclear program took off once Obama paid the Iranians the cash?
[03:26:03.642 --> 03:26:10.946]  So, I think what's most likely is the Iranians simply sent their 1.7 billion in cash to North Korea,
[03:26:11.741 --> 03:26:15.584]  To continue the Iranian nuclear program during the 10 years they're not allowed to produce.
[03:26:15.604 --> 03:26:24.169]  This means that Obama's nuclear deal actually caused both Iran and North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.
[03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:26.270]  That's probably what happened.
[03:26:26.711 --> 03:26:30.193]  And don't think for a second that Obama didn't know this all along.
[03:26:31.147 --> 03:26:38.311]  Obama's record in office was to diminish the power of the United States and empower America's intractable enemies.
[03:26:38.851 --> 03:26:45.615]  If you've seen my film, Dreams to My Real Father, you know that Obama was raised by a Russian agent, who I say is his real father.
[03:26:46.675 --> 03:26:49.397]  And Frank Marshall Davis taught Obama to hate.
[03:26:49.637 --> 03:26:54.299]  Taught him to hate America, hate white people, hate people of different economic classes.
[03:26:54.339 --> 03:26:57.101]  He taught him Malcolm X, Angela Davis.
[03:26:58.498 --> 03:27:05.701]  So much so that you can see that Obama is very comfortable with anti-American extremists and they're very comfortable with him.
[03:27:07.262 --> 03:27:12.564]  Again, the Iran deal may have in fact created two nuclear powers, North Korea and Iran.
[03:27:13.565 --> 03:27:18.627]  It took America over 10 years to recover from the disastrous Jimmy Carter presidency.
[03:27:19.147 --> 03:27:21.028]  It may take 20 or more years
[03:27:21.724 --> 03:27:30.232]  To recover from Obama's legacy of anti-Americanism, racial division, class division, and damage to security.
[03:27:31.153 --> 03:27:33.255]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour with Larry Klayman.
[03:27:33.916 --> 03:27:35.717]  First, we want to pay some bills.
[03:27:35.797 --> 03:27:43.024]  I want to tell you to please go to the InfoWars store because we want you to check out the Super Blue products at the InfoWars store.
[03:27:43.044 --> 03:27:44.726]  They're 50% off for a limited time.
[03:27:45.900 --> 03:27:55.026]  And it goes like this, in the fight to avoid outside toxins and fluoride, you may be missing one of the most obvious sources, your store brand toothpaste.
[03:27:55.687 --> 03:28:00.190]  While you try to keep your mouth clean, you may be filling your body with unnatural ingredients and fluoride.
[03:28:01.132 --> 03:28:04.978]  That's why InfoWars created the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[03:28:04.998 --> 03:28:08.964]  This groundbreaking fan favorite at InfoWars Life Products is 50% off.
[03:28:09.525 --> 03:28:16.376]  It's loaded with the good halogen iodine and other beneficial compounds, hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[03:28:17.102 --> 03:28:23.087]  Featuring plenty of natural oils, high quality ingredients, used in aboriginal and biblical times.
[03:28:23.188 --> 03:28:25.590]  Again, it's called Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:29.593]  It will supercharge your health and leave you with fresh minty breath.
[03:28:30.234 --> 03:28:33.677]  And you need something like that when you know the FBI isn't helping out.
[03:28:34.358 --> 03:28:37.921]  You know you need it because you need to have a break sometimes.
[03:28:37.961 --> 03:28:39.963]  And I think this will be something you'll really enjoy.
[03:28:40.643 --> 03:28:42.125]  If you're not a fan of peppermint, don't worry.
[03:28:42.145 --> 03:28:43.526]  There's also bubblegum flavor.
[03:28:44.460 --> 03:28:48.286]  You can expand your fluoride products for a full and natural bathroom habit.
[03:28:48.306 --> 03:28:52.412]  I'll be up at the bottom of the hour with attorney Larry Klayman of Freedom Watch USA.
[03:28:52.432 --> 03:28:53.213]  We'll take calls later.
[03:29:00.644 --> 03:29:08.329]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:29:09.189 --> 03:29:13.251]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:29:13.751 --> 03:29:16.093]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:29:16.893 --> 03:29:19.995]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:29:21.516 --> 03:29:33.665]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:29:34.366 --> 03:29:49.417]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:29:50.398 --> 03:29:54.123]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[03:29:54.684 --> 03:29:56.387]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:29:56.427 --> 03:29:58.670]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[03:30:04.378 --> 03:30:14.769]  Janice Atkinson is a member of parliament for the European Union, which again, it's an unelected body that runs it, but then they have a ceremonial parliament that's elected from the nation states.
[03:30:14.789 --> 03:30:19.054]  And it's become, not ceremonial, it is now basically breaking it up.
[03:30:19.114 --> 03:30:21.597]  What is the EU doing to counter strike against this awakening?
[03:30:22.077 --> 03:30:23.179]  I'm independent now.
[03:30:23.519 --> 03:30:29.065]  I'm sitting with the group that is the future for the European Parliament and also for Europe as a whole.
[03:30:29.105 --> 03:30:31.328]  People like Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders.
[03:30:31.708 --> 03:30:34.211]  Marine Le Pen came second to Macron.
[03:30:34.231 --> 03:30:37.134]  She's the official opposition to the presidency.
[03:30:37.595 --> 03:30:41.239]  In France at the moment, we've got Geert Wilders, who is the official opposition.
[03:30:41.739 --> 03:30:47.987]  And people in my party in the grouping in the parliament have also just formed the government for Austria.
[03:30:48.488 --> 03:30:57.258]  And next year we might even see the Lega Nord form a coalition with Silvio Berlusconi in Forza for Italia.
[03:30:57.498 --> 03:30:58.700]  So that's the way it's going.
[03:30:58.720 --> 03:30:59.761]  Now the populists are winning.
[03:30:59.781 --> 03:31:00.903]  They're trying to shut us down.
[03:31:02.263 --> 03:31:03.104]  It's not happening.
[03:31:03.924 --> 03:31:05.965]  They tried to censure us in the Parliament.
[03:31:06.265 --> 03:31:13.588]  I called somebody a lunatic the other day because actually she's a Liberal, she's the last remaining Liberal Democrat from the UK.
[03:31:13.848 --> 03:31:15.069]  I said she's quite mad.
[03:31:15.369 --> 03:31:17.150]  And I was censured because of that.
[03:31:17.210 --> 03:31:23.232]  You get this beep that comes up and we're censured for calling people what they are basically.
[03:31:25.586 --> 03:31:29.851]  What binds us all is that we have this visceral dislike of the EU.
[03:31:30.191 --> 03:31:42.044]  When I left UKIP and I decided to join Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders and other people like Matteo Salvini who could be the next Prime Minister of Italy in March of this year.
[03:31:42.745 --> 03:31:45.928]  We formed a small grouping, and we are known as the populists.
[03:31:45.968 --> 03:31:51.435]  They used to call us racists and xenophobes, just like they call Trump, all those things as well.
[03:31:51.815 --> 03:31:52.976]  And UKIP, actually.
[03:31:53.437 --> 03:31:57.441]  And we're a grand coalition of nine nations.
[03:31:57.522 --> 03:32:00.785]  We were with the Alternative für Deutschland in Germany.
[03:32:00.805 --> 03:32:02.928]  We think they've gone slightly far right.
[03:32:03.408 --> 03:32:15.999]  So, the leader of that party, who was the former leader of the AOD, who is Frauke Petry, and her husband, Markus Pretzel, have launched their own party now called the Blue Party, and we sit with them.
[03:32:16.399 --> 03:32:26.048]  We also sit with a couple of Czech people who have now gone to the polls in the Czech Republic, and they've got 22 members of parliament.
[03:32:26.088 --> 03:32:29.331]  They are now in negotiation to form the government.
[03:32:29.351 --> 03:32:30.772]  The government's already got a right wing
[03:32:31.212 --> 03:32:35.975]  The Social Democrats, the left, the liberal left of Europe, is absolutely collapsing.
[03:33:03.855 --> 03:33:06.479]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.545 --> 03:33:32.986]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:33.226 --> 03:33:34.407]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:34.867 --> 03:33:39.411]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:42.813 --> 03:33:44.614]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:44.714 --> 03:33:51.199]  I'm Joel Gilbert, sitting in for this hour on InfoWars, right from the left coast from Los Angeles, California.
[03:33:52.080 --> 03:33:53.681]  We're going to be taking some calls later.
[03:33:54.341 --> 03:33:55.042]  Start calling in.
[03:33:55.082 --> 03:33:55.342]  It's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:33:58.951 --> 03:33:59.211]  1-877-789-2539.
[03:33:59.351 --> 03:34:04.875]  I'm going to bring on my guest now.
[03:34:05.095 --> 03:34:10.539]  It's Larry Klayman, the incredible warrior, founder of Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch.
[03:34:11.200 --> 03:34:16.223]  He's known for his strong public interest advocacy in ethics, individual freedoms.
[03:34:16.844 --> 03:34:27.772]  Larry became so famous for fighting corruption that the NBC hit show West Wing named a character after him named Harry Claypool, played by John Deal.
[03:34:28.602 --> 03:34:32.644]  His latest book is Whores, Why and How I Came to Fight the Establishment.
[03:34:33.505 --> 03:34:35.325]  Larry Klayman, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:34:36.606 --> 03:34:37.286]  Thank you, Joe.
[03:34:37.567 --> 03:34:39.888]  Thank you for that nice introduction.
[03:34:40.768 --> 03:34:41.428]  Great to have you.
[03:34:41.989 --> 03:34:46.651]  All right, before we get into some of the FBI corruption, let's catch up a little bit.
[03:34:46.691 --> 03:34:51.834]  What people want to know is the Clintons have a rap sheet that would make Al Capone blush.
[03:34:52.834 --> 03:34:54.615]  Why have they never been put away?
[03:34:55.740 --> 03:35:00.023]  What have you done to try to do so and what has always stood in the way?
[03:35:02.405 --> 03:35:05.987]  So that's the $64,000 question adjusted for inflation.
[03:35:06.027 --> 03:35:07.468]  So it's now in the multimillions.
[03:35:08.068 --> 03:35:09.509]  But this is the way Washington works.
[03:35:09.569 --> 03:35:12.591]  It's why I founded Judicial Watch back in 1994.
[03:35:12.631 --> 03:35:13.452]  Of course, you know, I left.
[03:35:14.016 --> 03:35:14.836]  And I ran for the U.S.
[03:35:14.856 --> 03:35:20.459]  Senate, and I started Freedom Watch when I came out, and that can be found at freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:35:20.959 --> 03:35:24.381]  But it's all a giant kabuki dance in Washington, D.C.
[03:35:24.921 --> 03:35:33.485]  I did get a finding that Bill Clinton committed a crime when he released the Privacy Act-protected files of a woman he sexually assaulted in the Oval Office, Kathleen Willey.
[03:35:33.925 --> 03:35:37.587]  But other than that, the government does not take action against its own.
[03:35:37.647 --> 03:35:39.027]  It's like the National Football League.
[03:35:39.308 --> 03:35:42.189]  You have the American Conference, the National Conference, they both
[03:35:43.046 --> 03:35:51.324]  Despite these scandals, they go on TV, whether it's Fox News or CNN, depending on whether you're right or left, but nothing ever happens because there's an unwritten
[03:35:52.074 --> 03:36:01.300]  Truce between the parties that we're not going to take out any of our upper level establishment people and that's why you need a Larry Klayman and a Freedom Watch.
[03:36:01.821 --> 03:36:04.423]  I've now recommended that I be appointed special counsel.
[03:36:04.463 --> 03:36:05.383]  I'll get the job done.
[03:36:05.423 --> 03:36:06.464]  I'll take care of the Clintons.
[03:36:06.764 --> 03:36:07.905]  I'll take care of Obama.
[03:36:08.205 --> 03:36:10.046]  I'll take care of the corrupt Republicans.
[03:36:10.547 --> 03:36:15.250]  We're nonpartisan and they can sign our petition at freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.870]  It needs to be.
[03:36:15.890 --> 03:36:19.493]  We have 15,000 names so far but we need to have many more because
[03:36:20.153 --> 03:36:27.801]  The president needs to put his foot down and either nominate me or nominate somebody like me to finally get this job done because they're going to destroy him.
[03:36:27.841 --> 03:36:31.384]  Mueller will destroy him and so will the Obama-Clinton deep state.
[03:36:32.199 --> 03:36:40.444]  Alright, well that's what I want to... Look, conservatives have been very frustrated because, of course, Obama interfered in the 2012 election.
[03:36:40.464 --> 03:36:44.967]  He unleashed the IRS on conservative groups so they couldn't organize while the left could organize.
[03:36:45.667 --> 03:36:49.069]  Of course, Benghazi, American ambassador, killed.
[03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:51.230]  All the evidence was there, nothing happened.
[03:36:51.391 --> 03:36:52.651]  IRS, nothing happened.
[03:36:53.132 --> 03:36:56.914]  Now we've got the DOJ and FBI interfering in the 2016 election.
[03:36:57.474 --> 03:36:58.395]  What can you tell us
[03:36:59.286 --> 03:37:09.199]  To give us any encouragement or hope that the law will be applied against Obama and the left is that this will be any different, that it won't just be swept under the rug and let's move on.
[03:37:11.322 --> 03:37:14.266]  Joe, it won't be any different unless I'm appointed special counsel.
[03:37:14.306 --> 03:37:15.688]  There's nobody like me, frankly.
[03:37:16.468 --> 03:37:19.629]  And you can see what's going on right now with Trey Gowdy.
[03:37:19.669 --> 03:37:21.010]  He's playing both sides of the street.
[03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:22.590]  He's going out in a private practice.
[03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:23.731]  He's praising Mueller.
[03:37:24.111 --> 03:37:30.793]  He started an investigation over Rob Porter in the White House, the guy who was accused of abusing his ex-wife.
[03:37:31.733 --> 03:37:33.374]  These people play both sides of the street.
[03:37:33.414 --> 03:37:35.955]  So, you know, it's not just an advertisement.
[03:37:36.115 --> 03:37:40.916]  I honestly believe I will risk my life for this country if I have to.
[03:37:40.936 --> 03:37:42.357]  And I have been threatened in the past.
[03:37:43.118 --> 03:37:46.880]  Is that you need a Larry Klayman to be appointed special counsel or it won't happen.
[03:37:47.320 --> 03:37:48.401]  My former... Okay, Larry.
[03:37:49.302 --> 03:37:49.902]  Go ahead.
[03:37:50.842 --> 03:37:52.443]  No, my former group gets documents.
[03:37:52.483 --> 03:37:52.884]  That's good.
[03:37:53.204 --> 03:37:55.965]  But then they ask the government to do something.
[03:37:55.985 --> 03:37:57.146]  The government's not going to do anything.
[03:37:57.666 --> 03:38:02.209]  And if I'm special counsel, I will have the powers of the Justice Department behind me.
[03:38:02.769 --> 03:38:04.650]  And I conduct investigations.
[03:38:04.690 --> 03:38:09.413]  We've got enough now to indict the Clintons, to indict Obama, to indict Mueller for
[03:38:15.171 --> 03:38:23.418]  Okay, let's take for example, what's going on with Jeff Sessions?
[03:38:23.438 --> 03:38:33.606]  You'd think he would have the power to clean house, and people seem very frustrated that he's kind of acting like an employee at the DOJ instead of the head of the DOJ.
[03:38:34.047 --> 03:38:39.331]  Why isn't this guy, hardcore Southern conservative, supported Trump from the get-go, why isn't he cleaning house?
[03:38:40.512 --> 03:38:42.375]  Well, first of all, he's a politician, okay?
[03:38:43.015 --> 03:38:46.280]  So by his nature, he plays all sides at the same time.
[03:38:46.300 --> 03:38:55.552]  But the problem that Jeff Sessions has is that he himself is under investigation as either a subject or a target of Mueller's investigation.
[03:38:55.612 --> 03:38:56.373]  He's been accused
[03:38:57.006 --> 03:38:57.346]  I think so.
[03:39:19.491 --> 03:39:25.713]  He's been accused of playing a role in the firing of James Comey, which is, according to Mueller, possible obstruction of justice.
[03:39:25.733 --> 03:39:27.454]  So, he's put his head in the sand.
[03:39:27.854 --> 03:39:33.636]  He doesn't want to offend Mueller or the Democrats, and he's been absolutely zero as an Attorney General.
[03:39:33.676 --> 03:39:43.760]  I've said, and others have said after I said it, that he should resign or do his job, but he's been a complete, worthless disgrace as the Attorney General.
[03:39:45.979 --> 03:39:49.622]  Yeah, what you're also saying is that he was neutralized by these attacks from the left.
[03:39:49.662 --> 03:39:54.426]  Don't forget, Devin Nunes was neutralized by an ethics complaint for like six months.
[03:39:54.806 --> 03:40:00.090]  So maybe this is a technique that they'll always find something to make you afraid to do anything.
[03:40:01.304 --> 03:40:03.806]  What would you do day one, Larry Klayman?
[03:40:03.966 --> 03:40:05.407]  You're the special counsel.
[03:40:05.727 --> 03:40:07.769]  You're in charge of the Clinton investigation.
[03:40:08.570 --> 03:40:11.973]  Just for me, you're going to investigate Obama's background and who his father really is.
[03:40:12.493 --> 03:40:15.056]  And you're going to find out what the DOJ and FBI were up to.
[03:40:15.096 --> 03:40:16.096]  What do you do day one?
[03:40:16.137 --> 03:40:17.718]  What's your agenda those first couple days?
[03:40:19.144 --> 03:40:23.285]  Well, what I do is I impanel a grand jury and you start hauling these people in front of a grand jury.
[03:40:23.845 --> 03:40:32.108]  Now, we know that the evidence exists that Obama put forward a fraudulent birth certificate, regardless of where he was born, and I don't believe he was born in this country.
[03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:38.410]  With regard to who his father is, that's an open question, but it was a fraudulent birth certificate.
[03:40:38.988 --> 03:40:40.029]  And that is a crime.
[03:40:40.489 --> 03:40:41.790]  So he can be convicted for that.
[03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:50.996]  He can be convicted for using the intelligence agencies to illegally spy on hundreds of millions of Americans, notwithstanding President Trump, who we know he was behind that.
[03:40:51.416 --> 03:40:53.577]  He can be convicted for misuse of the IRS.
[03:40:54.097 --> 03:40:56.499]  I can go on and on and on, Joel, but there's a lot there.
[03:40:56.559 --> 03:40:58.300]  And of course, the Clintons, we know about them.
[03:40:58.340 --> 03:40:59.581]  That's a criminal enterprise.
[03:41:00.101 --> 03:41:02.783]  And they use the Clinton Foundation as that enterprise.
[03:41:03.343 --> 03:41:09.024]  To be able to make millions and millions of dollars at the expense of American national security.
[03:41:09.524 --> 03:41:10.485]  So yes, I'll bring him in.
[03:41:10.525 --> 03:41:12.505]  And that's the difference between Jeff Sessions and me.
[03:41:12.565 --> 03:41:17.606]  And that's why I want people to go to our website at freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:41:17.686 --> 03:41:18.646]  Sign that petition.
[03:41:19.187 --> 03:41:22.587]  Because, you see, the establishment doesn't want someone like Larry Klayman.
[03:41:22.627 --> 03:41:26.228]  We have to force it from the masses to say, yes, we need Larry.
[03:41:26.268 --> 03:41:28.369]  Because I will risk everything.
[03:41:28.769 --> 03:41:29.809]  Sessions won't risk anything.
[03:41:30.555 --> 03:41:37.420]  You'll empower, you'll put up a grand jury and you'll start calling people before the grand jury.
[03:41:38.541 --> 03:41:41.103]  You know, look, I'm hearing Jeanine Pirro every other Saturday.
[03:41:41.163 --> 03:41:44.126]  She says indictments are forthcoming and I just don't see it.
[03:41:44.146 --> 03:41:45.167]  Do you think she's credible?
[03:41:46.307 --> 03:41:48.889]  I like Jeanine Pirro and I like what she says, but you know what?
[03:41:49.350 --> 03:41:50.391]  She doesn't understand.
[03:41:50.651 --> 03:41:52.833]  You know, she's been a judge in New York State.
[03:41:53.733 --> 03:41:58.337]  She was a prosecutor, but in Washington D.C., the swamp, she doesn't understand it.
[03:41:58.617 --> 03:41:59.698]  She doesn't understand it yet.
[03:42:00.327 --> 03:42:04.710]  And, you know, Fox does this, and Fox does a good job, and I commend them, but they're doing it to boost ratings.
[03:42:05.410 --> 03:42:10.193]  They want people to think that something's going to happen, but we know it's not going to happen.
[03:42:10.753 --> 03:42:15.135]  Same thing for Hannity, you know, this optimism, or Sarah Carter, or John Solomon.
[03:42:15.155 --> 03:42:15.636]  I know them both.
[03:42:15.656 --> 03:42:16.316]  They're nice people.
[03:42:16.336 --> 03:42:17.117]  They're good reporters.
[03:42:17.697 --> 03:42:19.398]  But it's to try to boost interest.
[03:42:19.898 --> 03:42:22.900]  But unless you have Larry Klainman, a special prosecutor,
[03:42:23.507 --> 03:42:24.528]  It's not going to happen.
[03:42:24.588 --> 03:42:27.190]  It's never happened in my entire career.
[03:42:28.031 --> 03:42:29.392]  We're going to come back next segment.
[03:42:29.412 --> 03:42:31.013]  We're going to keep Larry Klayman with us.
[03:42:31.514 --> 03:42:33.656]  Please call in, ask questions of Larry.
[03:42:33.796 --> 03:42:37.199]  It's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:42:37.219 --> 03:42:41.322]  Again, 877-789-2593.
[03:42:42.023 --> 03:42:43.404]  Bring your questions to Larry Klayman.
[03:42:43.444 --> 03:42:46.407]  Let's see if we can get him into the special counsel's office.
[03:42:47.027 --> 03:42:49.910]  We'll be right back in a couple of minutes with Larry Klayman.
[03:42:59.924 --> 03:43:08.934]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:43:09.015 --> 03:43:17.144]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:43:17.404 --> 03:43:22.106]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:44:44.994 --> 03:44:47.939]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[03:45:02.423 --> 03:45:09.210]  This is the best deal we've ever offered on our flagship product, DNA Force.
[03:45:09.370 --> 03:45:11.212]  And it's got a very interesting story behind it.
[03:45:11.352 --> 03:45:17.058]  I was at a medical doctor's clinic facility that had top-of-the-line nutraceuticals and was noticing that they were $200 to $400.
[03:45:17.158 --> 03:45:25.085]  And then I talked to my dad about it, who is a physician, and he said, absolutely, this is the biggest area in nutraceuticals and supplements.
[03:45:25.126 --> 03:45:25.466]  He is
[03:45:25.686 --> 03:45:27.849]  Longevity and keeping your telomeres in place.
[03:45:27.889 --> 03:45:30.712]  You can't make telomeres grow, you can just make them not shrink as fast.
[03:45:30.752 --> 03:45:40.784]  Well, I designed DNA Force with Dr. Group, and Dr. Group's a great guy, but then we were gonna come out with Cell Force because I was able to find just as good of the same compounds for a lower price.
[03:45:41.585 --> 03:45:43.628]  And was able to develop Cell Force.
[03:45:44.108 --> 03:45:48.253]  And Groot liked the formula so much, he said, listen, we were going to come out with DNA Force Plus.
[03:45:48.793 --> 03:45:50.335]  You just use that name and do it.
[03:45:50.836 --> 03:45:52.678]  Because this is such an incredible formula.
[03:45:53.158 --> 03:45:55.321]  And I understand you're going to one of the biggest labs in the country.
[03:45:55.761 --> 03:45:57.944]  And so you were able to scale up and lower price.
[03:45:57.964 --> 03:45:58.705]  And I want to do that.
[03:45:59.085 --> 03:46:04.308]  He was so classy, he just said, you just put out DNA Force Plus as Shell Force, or vice versa.
[03:46:04.388 --> 03:46:05.389]  I was partnering with him on that.
[03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:06.429]  That's how classy he is.
[03:46:06.489 --> 03:46:08.450]  So, Shell Force is a limited run.
[03:46:08.530 --> 03:46:09.971]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[03:46:10.051 --> 03:46:16.975]  It will be called DNA Force Plus, because it's stronger than the old DNA Force, and it is less money.
[03:46:17.095 --> 03:46:19.937]  It's a good deal normally at $149, like DNA Force was, and we'd sell it for $99.
[03:46:21.838 --> 03:46:22.259]  On sale.
[03:46:22.339 --> 03:46:23.880]  We're selling it for $70.45.
[03:46:25.041 --> 03:46:28.104]  Used to, that's almost what it cost to make a bottle of DNA Force.
[03:46:28.124 --> 03:46:31.127]  Well, now we've lowered the price on the ingredients by buying even more.
[03:46:31.247 --> 03:46:33.449]  Just as high quality, we're lowering it for you.
[03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:35.871]  This is the best deal ever on DNA Force.
[03:46:36.271 --> 03:46:38.994]  It's DNA Force Plus, but called Cell Force.
[03:46:39.474 --> 03:46:52.001]  Because we weren't going to step on groups toes, we just put out CellForce separately, with a similar name to DNAForce, and it's even stronger and a lower price, super high quality, promotes cellular energy production, supports optimal mental health, and so much more.
[03:46:52.301 --> 03:46:53.381]  And it supports the InfoWar.
[03:46:53.561 --> 03:46:55.923]  Get the best deal ever at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:47:03.466 --> 03:47:06.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.714 --> 03:47:32.315]  Welcome back to InfoWars, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:32.595 --> 03:47:36.756]  Joel Gilbert here coming to you right from the left coast with my guest Larry Klayman.
[03:47:36.777 --> 03:47:41.899]  I'm going to take a few calls in a minute, but first, Larry, I want to ask you, you've been fighting the Clintons for 30 years.
[03:47:43.396 --> 03:47:48.938]  Tell us something we don't know that would just horrify us even more if that's even possible.
[03:47:49.098 --> 03:47:52.859]  Did Hillary order the attack on the Waco compound?
[03:47:53.899 --> 03:47:57.280]  Give us one thing we don't know that people would be really shocked by.
[03:47:57.300 --> 03:48:02.262]  What we don't know is what we don't know.
[03:48:02.862 --> 03:48:07.163]  Now, we know that there's a pattern in practice, Joel, of the Clintons going all the way back
[03:48:08.007 --> 03:48:08.488]  Decades.
[03:48:08.908 --> 03:48:14.353]  Where they use government services, they sell it for campaign contributions and to line their own pockets.
[03:48:14.373 --> 03:48:15.454]  There's a lot of things we don't know.
[03:48:15.514 --> 03:48:22.841]  Now, one of the things that I was trying to uncover was the sale of waivers to do business with Iran while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.
[03:48:23.601 --> 03:48:24.903]  This is something that hasn't come out.
[03:48:24.923 --> 03:48:29.647]  A Democrat judge was appointed to this case and not one document ever came out.
[03:48:30.208 --> 03:48:32.670]  So consequently, that's something that we'll be looking into
[03:48:33.408 --> 03:48:36.969]  If I'm special counsel, because she was actually selling U.S.
[03:48:37.009 --> 03:48:42.671]  national security, undermining the sanctions against Iran, to line her own pocket.
[03:48:42.711 --> 03:48:43.952]  We know that's what they do.
[03:48:44.652 --> 03:48:47.373]  And I also want to get into some of the judges who have covered for them.
[03:48:48.053 --> 03:48:50.914]  Frankly, they should be indicted too for covering these things up.
[03:48:51.714 --> 03:49:02.698]  I'm writing a column today for worldnetdaily.com about the judges, and we have such politicized Obama and Clinton hacks on the bench that they slow roll everything.
[03:49:03.268 --> 03:49:04.329]  And we've got to break through that.
[03:49:04.369 --> 03:49:06.091]  We have to start impeaching some of them.
[03:49:06.151 --> 03:49:09.254]  And I'm going to be working with the Judiciary Committee to do that.
[03:49:09.815 --> 03:49:13.158]  But as special counsel, I can bring them in front of the grand jury.
[03:49:13.278 --> 03:49:16.141]  And in fact, we can indict them for covering things up.
[03:49:16.181 --> 03:49:17.062]  Let me give you an example.
[03:49:17.183 --> 03:49:21.347]  Amy Berman Jackson, who's sitting on the Manafort prosecution.
[03:49:22.102 --> 03:49:24.684]  First of all, won't let Manafort out of house arrest.
[03:49:24.944 --> 03:49:29.247]  Then she puts a gaggler on so he can't defend himself when he's being attacked in the media.
[03:49:29.728 --> 03:49:34.511]  On top of that, she's not concerned about the criminal grand jury leaks of Mueller, which are criminal.
[03:49:34.892 --> 03:49:38.675]  They're trying to destroy Trump and everybody around him before they're even tried.
[03:49:39.235 --> 03:49:43.999]  So these are the kinds of things, if a judge violates his or her oath of office, she should be indicted.
[03:49:44.539 --> 03:49:46.381]  And Amy Berman Jackson should be indicted.
[03:49:46.861 --> 03:49:48.722]  So that's why I need to be special counsel.
[03:49:48.742 --> 03:49:50.283]  I mean, there will be hell to pay.
[03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:53.551]  Alright Larry, I think a lot of people would like to see that.
[03:49:53.591 --> 03:49:58.953]  Let's go to Rudy in California and see what he thinks of Larry Klayman as the special prosecutor.
[03:49:58.973 --> 03:49:59.373]  Rudy?
[03:49:59.393 --> 03:50:02.675]  Go ahead Rudy, you're on.
[03:50:02.735 --> 03:50:06.796]  I'm telling you, this Robert Mueller is no good.
[03:50:06.897 --> 03:50:09.438]  I mean, he is truly the deep state.
[03:50:09.498 --> 03:50:10.298]  That's who he is.
[03:50:11.115 --> 03:50:12.957]  I mean, here I am, I'm in California.
[03:50:12.977 --> 03:50:21.045]  You know, I was raised around Democrats, but I'm becoming more, I guess you could say more of a conservative Democrat now, but I'm different than them.
[03:50:21.305 --> 03:50:22.787]  I tell you, I'm getting tired of this.
[03:50:22.807 --> 03:50:23.788]  This is ridiculous.
[03:50:25.810 --> 03:50:27.051]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[03:50:27.652 --> 03:50:28.593]  Let me go to someone else.
[03:50:28.653 --> 03:50:34.379]  Let's go to, there's also a Dr. Kelly who wants to volunteer for Larry's
[03:50:35.123 --> 03:50:40.207]  Special grand jury Larry, is it legal if you put on a Alex Jones supporter?
[03:50:40.227 --> 03:50:56.158]  Let's let's see what dr. Kelly has to say Are you there with you today and thank you for your work and I would like to volunteer and I would like to call on all Californians and Nevadans to wake up.
[03:50:56.239 --> 03:51:02.243]  This is the grand jury reawakening you need to get there and serve at your county level and
[03:51:02.699 --> 03:51:10.403]  You need to do the accusation and indictment functions of your criminal grand jury, as well as your civil.
[03:51:11.283 --> 03:51:23.689]  And I've got to serve for three years in one of the 58 California counties, and I would like to volunteer for the special federal grand jury if needed.
[03:51:23.709 --> 03:51:24.290]  Okay, thank you.
[03:51:24.350 --> 03:51:25.130]  Thank you for the call.
[03:51:25.330 --> 03:51:30.233]  Larry, can you take volunteers in this way, or you'd have to get them more at random to be able to really kick ass?
[03:51:30.313 --> 03:51:30.773]  How does it work?
[03:51:32.301 --> 03:51:33.202]  Who's on the grand jury?
[03:51:33.222 --> 03:51:34.904]  Two ways to do it.
[03:51:35.464 --> 03:51:38.247]  I have a citizen's grand jury in Ocala, Florida.
[03:51:38.971 --> 03:51:40.012]  A very conservative place.
[03:51:40.032 --> 03:51:40.833]  You know, I'm from Florida.
[03:51:41.313 --> 03:51:46.878]  And I actually did indict Clinton and Obama, and we convicted them in front of a citizen's trial.
[03:51:47.839 --> 03:51:53.904]  Grand juries don't belong to the judicial branch, they don't belong to the executive branch, they don't belong to the legislative branch.
[03:51:53.964 --> 03:51:59.148]  Judge Scalia ruled that in a case, United States v. Williams, back in 1982.
[03:52:00.069 --> 03:52:03.072]  So we can do it in ourselves, but the problem is we can't enforce
[03:52:03.792 --> 03:52:05.154]  The indictments and convictions.
[03:52:05.194 --> 03:52:09.598]  And that's why if I'm special counsel, you see, I have the powers of the Justice Department, the U.S.
[03:52:09.658 --> 03:52:10.439]  Marshals Service.
[03:52:10.879 --> 03:52:15.083]  And once we indict them, once we convict them, then you can enforce it.
[03:52:15.264 --> 03:52:22.711]  Because I've always said that the worst punishment for Bill and Hillary Clinton is to be put in prison in the same prison cell together for the rest of their lives.
[03:52:23.031 --> 03:52:25.314]  But those grand juries are chosen randomly.
[03:52:25.994 --> 03:52:26.714]  On voter rolls.
[03:52:26.875 --> 03:52:30.996]  Okay, but if people want to assist us as volunteers, that's something that we can consider.
[03:52:31.076 --> 03:52:34.998]  So go to our website at freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:52:35.078 --> 03:52:35.978]  Sign the petition.
[03:52:36.359 --> 03:52:37.559]  You can put comments up there.
[03:52:37.599 --> 03:52:43.101]  Let me know who you are and we'll be back in contact with you because we do need a citizen's army.
[03:52:43.181 --> 03:52:44.362]  I'm trying to avoid Joel.
[03:52:45.102 --> 03:52:46.823]  I don't want there to be a violent revolution.
[03:52:47.203 --> 03:52:48.264]  I want this to be peaceful.
[03:52:48.364 --> 03:52:49.004]  So we need
[03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:57.056]  Larry Klayman, and I know I sound like I'm advertising myself, but I honestly believe it in my heart, is that I'm the only one that will do it and can do it.
[03:52:57.096 --> 03:52:58.657]  Everybody else is like Jeff Sessions.
[03:52:58.997 --> 03:53:01.839]  They'll put their heads in the sand because they're going to put their interests ahead of the country.
[03:53:02.139 --> 03:53:07.924]  We don't have patriots anymore in positions of power in law enforcement that are willing to go against the Clintons.
[03:53:08.444 --> 03:53:10.966]  Sessions is a nice man, but he lacks guts.
[03:53:12.107 --> 03:53:16.830]  Well, how and when did the DOJ and FBI and even CIA
[03:53:17.822 --> 03:53:32.387]  Become so corrupt with leftists and people that are not following the law and are on the goose chases like Russian hoaxsters instead of dealing with people making threats and Islamic terrorists in the United States.
[03:53:32.627 --> 03:53:33.407]  How did that happen?
[03:53:35.387 --> 03:53:37.328]  Well, it's always been somewhat the case.
[03:53:37.408 --> 03:53:41.449]  This is why I was a Justice Department lawyer and very proud when I became one.
[03:53:42.030 --> 03:53:42.670]  I helped break up AT&T.
[03:53:43.979 --> 03:53:46.364]  But I saw how it was so politicized.
[03:53:46.605 --> 03:53:51.074]  If you're on the wrong side of the street, you're more likely to be indicted and tried.
[03:53:51.094 --> 03:53:51.996]  And if you're on the right side...
[03:53:52.614 --> 03:53:53.695]  They would look the other way.
[03:53:53.815 --> 03:53:55.376]  So it's been that way to a certain extent.
[03:53:55.416 --> 03:53:57.918]  But over the last several decades, it's gotten much worse.
[03:53:58.498 --> 03:53:59.599]  It's gotten politicized.
[03:54:00.940 --> 03:54:08.465]  97% of the lawyers at the Justice Department either contributed monies or voted for either Clinton or Obama.
[03:54:08.685 --> 03:54:09.486]  That's unbelievable.
[03:54:09.526 --> 03:54:10.226]  They're leftists.
[03:54:10.787 --> 03:54:20.073]  And the people at the top are scared to take them on, like Sessions, because they're scared that those people wind up going against them, leaking information, smearing them, whatever.
[03:54:20.093 --> 03:54:21.114]  There's this deep state.
[03:54:21.815 --> 03:54:23.596]  That is highly leftist in this country.
[03:54:24.177 --> 03:54:29.081]  And that's why, you know, I want to be special counsel because I won't let that influence me.
[03:54:29.121 --> 03:54:30.322]  I've always been nonpartisan.
[03:54:30.342 --> 03:54:32.583]  I went against Bush and Cheney when they did the wrong thing.
[03:54:33.204 --> 03:54:36.706]  But this is not the kind of a situation where you need someone who's going to play politics.
[03:54:36.766 --> 03:54:38.107]  Our country's hanging in the balance.
[03:54:38.848 --> 03:54:44.012]  President Trump is our last hope before we get something even worse than Obama and Clinton.
[03:54:44.592 --> 03:54:50.477]  And we need to do whatever we can to bring about justice to get these leftists, financed by George Soros, this
[03:54:51.614 --> 03:55:04.063]  I'm of Jewish origin myself, I'm a Christian, I'm a Jewish Christian, so I don't mean this in an anti-Semitic way, but he's a self-hating Jew who assisted the Nazis in World War II in confiscating property from the Jewish people.
[03:55:04.103 --> 03:55:10.048]  This is the guy who's financing the Democratic Party and Obama and Clinton and the rest of them.
[03:55:11.848 --> 03:55:14.269]  Let me make a comment about Soros.
[03:55:14.289 --> 03:55:15.670]  I want to say something about Soros.
[03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:21.894]  People don't know the whole history that he was the only Nazi spy that wasn't executed by the Russians.
[03:55:22.394 --> 03:55:30.179]  He shows up in London dealing stolen art that the Nazis had taken and that the Soviets had then captured.
[03:55:31.730 --> 03:55:36.392]  He's engaging in a one-man crime wave during the Cold War, trying to collapse the British pound.
[03:55:36.872 --> 03:55:37.932]  And then he comes to the U.S.
[03:55:37.972 --> 03:55:40.253]  with his Open Society program.
[03:55:41.453 --> 03:55:49.536]  He's somebody that, if you look at his history, you just have to ask the question, was he originally a Russian agent?
[03:55:50.077 --> 03:55:53.978]  And is that why they spared him, just like the Nazis spared him because he agreed to work for them?
[03:55:55.242 --> 03:55:58.823]  Did he agree to work for the Soviets once they captured him?
[03:55:59.543 --> 03:56:03.164]  And I think if you look at his record, you have to ask that question seriously.
[03:56:03.384 --> 03:56:06.005]  Let's go to one more quick call with Chris in Virginia.
[03:56:08.766 --> 03:56:09.246]  Chris, you're on.
[03:56:10.426 --> 03:56:18.348]  Yeah, what I was wondering about is how do we get rid of the entrenched deep state in the DOJ and the Justice Department?
[03:56:18.388 --> 03:56:21.469]  If you look at it, Mueller, then Comey,
[03:56:22.105 --> 03:56:22.786]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[03:56:22.826 --> 03:56:23.486]  We only got a minute left.
[03:56:23.506 --> 03:56:24.027]  Larry, can you comment?
[03:56:24.087 --> 03:56:25.868]  How do you get rid of this entrenched, deep state?
[03:56:25.888 --> 03:56:26.769]  97% of lawyers are leftists.
[03:56:26.809 --> 03:56:28.650]  It's all throughout the system now.
[03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:30.492]  Does it even matter that Trump won?
[03:56:30.532 --> 03:56:33.434]  Did Obama stack the system so much that it doesn't even matter?
[03:56:52.449 --> 03:56:52.789]  It does.
[03:56:52.809 --> 03:57:02.412]  For the same reason that President Trump has the power to have me appointed special counsel, and again go to freedomwatchusa.org, sign that petition, because I send him those names.
[03:57:02.872 --> 03:57:04.433]  And I'm also sending Sessions those names.
[03:57:04.853 --> 03:57:08.074]  He has the same power to clean house at the Justice Department.
[03:57:08.094 --> 03:57:09.815]  He's not getting good advice right now.
[03:57:10.195 --> 03:57:14.436]  The poor guy is hit with 25 different things every day of people trying to destroy him.
[03:57:14.796 --> 03:57:17.177]  But he has the power to clean out the Justice Department.
[03:57:17.757 --> 03:57:19.538]  I'll tell you, most people there walk around like
[03:57:20.183 --> 03:57:22.264]  Night of the Walking Dead, like zombies.
[03:57:22.724 --> 03:57:26.186]  About 30% of the Justice Department actually does this job.
[03:57:26.206 --> 03:57:27.127]  You can get rid of 70%.
[03:57:27.827 --> 03:57:32.710]  Let's keep 30% who aren't inflicted by being Clinton and Obama loyalists.
[03:57:33.210 --> 03:57:35.812]  Okay, Larry Klayman, thank you very much for being our guest.
[03:57:35.872 --> 03:57:37.853]  This is InfoWars with Joel Gilbert.
[03:57:38.273 --> 03:57:39.253]  Thank you for being here.
[03:57:39.534 --> 03:57:42.936]  Please check InfoWars.com, FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[03:57:43.856 --> 03:57:45.477]  Thank you so much, right from the left coast.
[03:57:50.370 --> 03:57:54.172]  With Alpha Power by InfoWars Life, you can be in charge of your energy again.
[03:57:54.492 --> 03:57:59.434]  Alpha Power helps with a large amount of functions for your body to help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[03:57:59.694 --> 03:58:03.316]  Alpha Power has a 4.8 star rating on InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:03.616 --> 03:58:07.157]  Listen to all these incredible 5 star reviews from verified buyers.
[03:58:07.498 --> 03:58:10.599]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[03:58:10.859 --> 03:58:13.020]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin.
[03:58:13.280 --> 03:58:20.223]  And it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[03:58:20.343 --> 03:58:22.684]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[03:58:22.924 --> 03:58:24.605]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[03:58:24.825 --> 03:58:27.446]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible.
[03:58:27.706 --> 03:58:32.248]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time.
[03:58:32.568 --> 03:58:38.631]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[03:58:39.071 --> 03:58:43.594]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[03:58:44.074 --> 03:58:45.215]  That helps with focus, too.
[03:58:45.655 --> 03:58:46.635]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[03:58:47.136 --> 03:58:51.258]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[03:58:51.678 --> 03:58:55.721]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[03:58:55.981 --> 03:58:57.522]  There's definitely been a change.
[03:58:57.782 --> 03:58:58.442]  For the better.
[03:58:58.863 --> 03:59:02.645]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[03:59:03.045 --> 03:59:04.726]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[03:59:05.126 --> 03:59:06.027]  I hope this lasts.
[03:59:06.847 --> 03:59:08.909]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[03:59:09.209 --> 03:59:15.314]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[03:59:15.615 --> 03:59:20.559]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[03:59:21.019 --> 03:59:24.342]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[03:59:24.942 --> 03:59:29.967]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM, and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[03:59:30.527 --> 03:59:32.328]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[03:59:32.608 --> 03:59:33.128]  Not anymore.
[03:59:33.508 --> 03:59:34.689]  Seem to be sleeping better, too.
[03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:37.089]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[03:59:37.330 --> 03:59:38.710]  I will definitely buy this again.
