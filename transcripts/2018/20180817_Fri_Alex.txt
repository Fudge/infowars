[00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:27.943]  Yeah, I think.
[00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:03.413]  Emotional incontinence.
[00:01:03.413 --> 00:01:05.275]  You have urinary incontinence.
[00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.838]  No, I said emotional incontinence.
[00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:09.400]  Sorry, I hate f***ing crying.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.689]  As Western civilization collapses, which it is, so does our ability to deal with minor day-to-day struggles.
[00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.349]  I've just been, like, so unhappy.
[00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:19.110]  She don't think I feel bad.
[00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:42.496]  The masses overdose on reality TV, thinking that it's actually reality, and then mimic it in their own lives.
[00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:49.018]  The more insipid sentimentality displayed on TV, the more it manifests itself in the here and now.
[00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:57.900]  Vacuous people live their lives vicariously through celebrities and television, then base their own personalities on that.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.741]  Reality TV doesn't reflect reality.
[00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:03.103]  It contrives reality.
[00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:14.753]  It relentlessly broadcasts the message that ostentatious, OTT, often dumb displays of emotion are to be imitated.
[00:02:14.753 --> 00:02:20.137]  People breaking down and sobbing because Gordon Ramsay had his team renovate their restaurant.
[00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:23.941]  A stunning fresh coat of paint.
[00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:26.943]  We've updated Bell Paul Street.
[00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:27.544]  New plates.
[00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:35.845]  No, you're not supposed to cry over a paint job and some new furniture.
[00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:37.646]  The same is true of YouTube.
[00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:43.030]  YouTubers are rewarded for emotional incontinence and oversharing.
[00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.792]  The Try Not To Cry Challenge.
[00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:50.395]  Constantly crying and whining about their drama and their breakups.
[00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:53.497]  The viewers lap it up like water in the desert.
[00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:55.438]  Then ape their behavior.
[00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:57.000]  Oh, why is everyone crying?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.941]  He's such a baby.
[00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:01.685]  Last year, Twitter users revealed what made them cry.
[00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:15.940]  The answers included people who cried at not being able to fit all the things they wanted to in their bag, getting the wrong sauce with chicken McNuggets, and crying at a picture of a man because he looked like he was nice.
[00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:22.863]  The floodgates of emotional incontinence are also flung open whenever a celebrity dies.
[00:03:22.863 --> 00:03:31.025]  Why do people whimper and sob over dead celebrities they never knew, and in many cases, rarely even thought about until they died?
[00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:33.566]  Does this betray another form of weakness?
[00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:37.787]  Our inability to process the concept of death itself.
[00:03:37.787 --> 00:03:46.130]  Our mass public outpourings of grief and canonization of dead celebrities, a sign that humanity has never been more afraid.
[00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.031]  of its own mortality.
[00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:54.874]  A sign that excessive emoting is making us both more insecure and more insincere.
[00:03:54.874 --> 00:04:03.879]  As Theodore Dalrymple wrote, we live in an age of emotional incontinence when they who emote the most are believed to feel the most.
[00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:21.887]  As we become increasingly atomized by the breakdown of the family structure and its replacement by this empty late-stage capitalist corporate monoculture, authentic expressions of private love have been replaced by spurious public displays of counterfeit emotion.
[00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:26.509]  Why are we constantly told that there's a stigma around depression?
[00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.671]  That there's a stigma around expressing emotion?
[00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:31.131]  There isn't.
[00:04:31.131 --> 00:04:32.672]  The opposite is true.
[00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:41.213]  It's constantly drilled into us that depression is normal and that emotional incontinence and oversharing is to be encouraged.
[00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:44.654]  You can barely go two minutes.
[00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:54.836]  The age, the age, ladies and gentlemen, of psychological incontinence is up on InfoWars.com, the full video from Paul Watson.
[00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.677]  We'll be back with the most censored broadcast in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:01.677]  We knew it was coming.
[00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:03.137]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:17.003]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia, and then voila!
[00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:27.435]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:30.438]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:05:30.438 --> 00:05:31.920]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.382]  Just click on the link.
[00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:36.325]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:46.449]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:58.552]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:05:58.552 --> 00:05:59.833]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:06:22.262 --> 00:06:23.583]  It's Friday, August 17, 2018.
[00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:30.067]  There's only 81 days left until the most important elections in U.S.
[00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:31.367]  history.
[00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:41.093]  We are the tip of the spear attempting to alert the American people and the world to the threat of globalism and the all-out assault on Western civilization and America.
[00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:42.514]  Whatever you do, realize...
[00:06:43.034 --> 00:06:59.684]  The globalists have made a miscalculation and are committed to shut down this transmission with every form of assault you can imagine because they believe you're stupid and won't notice what's happening, but they can bring in their draconian Chinese communist style censorship in America.
[00:06:59.684 --> 00:07:01.665]  But we are here exposing it.
[00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:05.628]  They are scared of this information because it is the answer to their corruption.
[00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:09.170]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday Global Broadcast.
[00:07:10.157 --> 00:07:14.965]  Let me tell you what's coming up today, and then I'll get into all of it.
[00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:44.484]  The left, as I've told you for 20 plus years, is brainwashed to hate America and is trained by the high schools, the colleges, the mainline churches, the culture, that America is the ultimate evil in the world because the globalists want a one world planetary government that controls America and other western nations to enforce their planetary plan of absolute and complete domination.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.941]  Now, that's known now.
[00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:54.167]  They tried to deny that any of that existed for decade after decade after decade while they built their world government.
[00:07:54.974 --> 00:08:10.865]  But once they had to emerge the world government, once they had to take it out of the shipyards and actually put it into the ocean, the world can now see the dreadnought, the corrupt battleship of tyranny, the aircraft carrier of lies that is the One World Government planetary program.
[00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:22.694]  So all over the world it's in big trouble because it's authoritarian, it's above the law, it is tax-exempt, it is diplomatically immune, it is totally maniacal and anti-human.
[00:08:23.672 --> 00:08:31.013]  And as the public begins to learn about that and learn that it's anti-prosperity and anti-human, there's going to be a giant resistance that forms.
[00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:39.381]  They have decided to take me, build me up as this monster, and then use me as the first domino to fall to eradicate free speech in the West.
[00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:41.542]  That is all confirmed now.
[00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:42.542]  Law firms in D.C.
[00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:52.185]  have gone and looked at the statements by Democrats in Congress, their own secret reports, and have concurred that by next year, they plan to basically end the First Amendment in America.
[00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:57.267]  It's our job to raise the alarm bell that A, they're doing that, and that B, it's got to be stopped.
[00:08:58.087 --> 00:09:10.355]  So the first thing I'm going to cover when we come back in the next segment, which will be the second thing I cover, I'm about to cover one big topic now that ties into this, is the fact that the Republicans don't understand what's happening.
[00:09:10.355 --> 00:09:12.897]  They've been manipulated.
[00:09:12.897 --> 00:09:15.359]  I'm not calling for government regulation of the Internet.
[00:09:15.359 --> 00:09:17.821]  I'm not calling for regulation of these corporations.
[00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:23.664]  But it's already happened by fiat via the EU and its fines and regulations.
[00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.526]  via these companies wanting to move to China.
[00:09:26.526 --> 00:09:38.011]  They're going under China's regulatory auspices and they're unifying, without asking anybody, an unofficial global corporate charter of censorship and control.
[00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:42.913]  And then the Republicans sit back like a bunch of fools and go, well, we're not going to get involved in what companies do.
[00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:44.473]  They're private companies.
[00:09:44.473 --> 00:09:45.334]  You can't operate.
[00:09:46.727 --> 00:09:48.548]  As a utility.
[00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:56.694]  And then have rules that you only selectively enforce on nationalists, capitalists, middle class, patriots, pro-military, pro-Second Amendment people.
[00:09:56.694 --> 00:09:59.216]  And we all know that's what's going on.
[00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:07.922]  So this is false advertising, it's racketeering, it's monopoly practices when you have the top six companies all in the same day ban info wars.
[00:10:07.922 --> 00:10:10.764]  And then 20 other companies plus follow suit.
[00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:15.782]  That is called a monopoly combine.
[00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:19.804]  The very worst monopoly system where a group of monopolies work in concert.
[00:10:19.804 --> 00:10:24.147]  It's called a car-kel.
[00:10:24.147 --> 00:10:25.988]  And so, we're going to get the message out.
[00:10:25.988 --> 00:10:31.651]  And we've been putting this message out to the White House, to Congress, and it's one big reason we've been banned.
[00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:32.531]  But I'm willing to do it.
[00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:35.833]  I'm not going to play along with the systems.
[00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:39.103]  I'm not... I mean, there it is.
[00:10:39.103 --> 00:10:46.751]  Apple banned Alex Jones, and then the dominoes started to fall.
[00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:50.114]  I didn't even know they'd actually written an article using that term, but that's exactly what I've been calling it.
[00:10:50.114 --> 00:11:00.425]  It's the domino effect, and then they go, oh, hip hip hooray, take Alex Jones down, and a lot of conservatives go, well, they've built a straw man about him, they've demonized him, I'm not going to really defend him.
[00:11:01.906 --> 00:11:02.767]  And then you're next.
[00:11:02.767 --> 00:11:04.848]  And of course it's now, it's now happened.
[00:11:04.848 --> 00:11:07.570]  So this is extremely draconian.
[00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.533]  These big companies together represent over 90% of the internet.
[00:11:11.533 --> 00:11:14.915]  And so now they're saying we're not gonna even let people advertise on our platforms.
[00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:16.816]  We're not gonna let people even have bank accounts.
[00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:19.458]  Jahad Watch has had their MasterCard taken away.
[00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:20.879]  They had for 20 years.
[00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:22.900]  Now MasterCard says you can't bank.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.801]  You can't live.
[00:11:25.996 --> 00:11:27.398]  Oh, it's just a private company.
[00:11:27.398 --> 00:11:31.462]  They are organizing, like tyrannies always do, to link up.
[00:11:31.462 --> 00:11:37.189]  It's the linking up of companies in a cartel to persecute groups that is totally illegal.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.542]  That is the most dangerous expression of communism and fascism and authoritarianism.
[00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:44.424]  It is the tell-tale sign.
[00:11:44.424 --> 00:11:48.626]  Censorship, cartels linking together, trying to kick you out of the market.
[00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:52.008]  It is exactly what Adolf Hitler did.
[00:11:52.008 --> 00:11:53.368]  It's exactly what V.I.
[00:11:53.368 --> 00:11:54.169]  Lenin did.
[00:11:54.169 --> 00:11:56.130]  It's exactly what Mao Zedong did.
[00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.051]  It's exactly what Hugo Chavez did.
[00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.813]  It's exactly what Fidel Castro did.
[00:12:01.813 --> 00:12:04.074]  It's exactly what these regimes do.
[00:12:04.074 --> 00:12:06.476]  One hundred percent it's what Mussolini did.
[00:12:07.213 --> 00:12:08.674]  Benito Mussolini.
[00:12:08.674 --> 00:12:19.221]  It is the blood, the guts, the bone, the brain, the skin, the hair, the arms, the everything of tyranny!
[00:12:19.221 --> 00:12:20.322]  It's it!
[00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:24.505]  We know what it looks like, we know what it acts like, we know how it behaves, we know what it is.
[00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:31.510]  So see, I've already kind of gotten into my whole argument that
[00:12:35.236 --> 00:12:37.057]  We must stop this now.
[00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:46.100]  By Congress not having any control over the Internet, they have removed net neutrality.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.581]  Now again, Obama called it net neutrality.
[00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:57.523]  But what that was, was bringing in regulations so these companies could censor whoever they wanted to have liability protection.
[00:12:57.523 --> 00:13:04.766]  The Republicans said we're reversing that, but then they didn't put anything in its place, so then it became even more of a free-for-all.
[00:13:07.534 --> 00:13:08.474]  But again, it's global.
[00:13:08.474 --> 00:13:12.596]  America's only 325 million people.
[00:13:12.596 --> 00:13:14.316]  China's a billion and a half.
[00:13:14.316 --> 00:13:16.677]  India's a billion, 100 million.
[00:13:16.677 --> 00:13:18.478]  The EU's 350-something million.
[00:13:18.478 --> 00:13:25.180]  There's all these other places, and the EU's coming in with billion-dollar fines every few weeks against these companies to go under their regulations.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.541]  They're not going to just create all these different regulations for different countries and regions.
[00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:31.462]  They're adopting the EU and Chinese model.
[00:13:31.462 --> 00:13:35.744]  They're building the Chinese censorship engines, and they're building them here, and they're just unifying it.
[00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:44.588]  So by Congress leaving this vacuum open, and by all of us sitting here like fools going, we're an open society,
[00:13:45.603 --> 00:13:46.603]  These are private companies.
[00:13:46.603 --> 00:13:47.724]  They can do what they want.
[00:13:47.724 --> 00:13:56.366]  The Democrats are now all over the news banning all Republicans even talking about their campaigns or putting their campaign ads up on their Facebook or Twitter or YouTube.
[00:13:56.366 --> 00:13:58.487]  But the Democrats can operate all they want.
[00:13:58.487 --> 00:14:04.289]  Antifa said we're going to put bullets in Congress's heads and kill Trump and kill his family and kill talk show hosts.
[00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:09.031]  And I go, well, folks, you better have your battle rifles ready by your bed because they may actually attack your houses.
[00:14:09.031 --> 00:14:10.711]  It's already been happening.
[00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:13.152]  That turns into, I said, battle rifles for the media.
[00:14:13.814 --> 00:14:15.575]  And they don't show it, do they?
[00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:18.257]  Because they've gone next-level fraud, folks.
[00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.179]  This shows they're going for broke.
[00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:25.843]  So, there is a vacuum.
[00:14:25.843 --> 00:14:31.287]  There is a system of Congress asleep at the switch, drooling.
[00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:43.236]  And the Googles and Facebooks and Apples of the world patting them on the back like they're complete morons while they adopt the EU and Chinese model and merge the censorship systems in standardization.
[00:14:44.827 --> 00:14:52.530]  And now they're saying, hell, if we win the House, we're going to go ahead with full internet takeover and total censorship.
[00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.051]  That's been out for weeks.
[00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:58.513]  And Senator Warner on Monday released more documents calling for it.
[00:14:58.513 --> 00:15:02.954]  I've got one of the top first-minute law firms in the country, and they looked at it and they could not believe it.
[00:15:02.954 --> 00:15:06.196]  This is true tyranny.
[00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:09.017]  Are you thinking they're not going to just fill that vacuum?
[00:15:09.017 --> 00:15:14.279]  Whenever Governor Cuomo said America was never great, America's a piece of crap, and CNN agreed with him, that's coming up.
[00:15:15.902 --> 00:15:17.623]  They're telling you the truth.
[00:15:17.623 --> 00:15:22.247]  They are such in their echo chambers that they literally hate America.
[00:15:22.247 --> 00:15:25.730]  The majority of millennials want communism, but they've got $1,000 phones and $200 skinny jeans.
[00:15:28.103 --> 00:15:34.830]  These people mean business, and they're making their move right now.
[00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.234]  And they're shutting us down because we're ringing the alarm bells, because we're faithful Americans.
[00:15:39.234 --> 00:15:40.756]  We're faithful to the Republic.
[00:15:40.756 --> 00:15:42.477]  We're faithful to the free market.
[00:15:42.477 --> 00:15:48.163]  We're faithful to prosperity and what we know is a steady, strong course that made us the apple of the world's eye.
[00:15:48.163 --> 00:15:51.767]  We know we have been exceptional when we exercised the principles that made us great.
[00:15:52.387 --> 00:15:54.348]  We know we are the light on the hill to the world.
[00:15:54.348 --> 00:15:57.209]  And we know the enemies are trying to pull that down.
[00:15:57.209 --> 00:15:57.709]  Stay with us.
[00:15:57.709 --> 00:16:00.290]  We are the Infowar.
[00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.030]  Let's talk tough.
[00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.431]  Let's talk comfort.
[00:16:03.431 --> 00:16:05.832]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:08.753]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[00:16:08.753 --> 00:16:10.773]  Like you wore as a kid.
[00:16:10.773 --> 00:16:11.654]  Remember?
[00:16:11.654 --> 00:16:18.396]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.815]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:16:23.815 --> 00:16:27.080]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:33.270]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.853]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:16:37.174 --> 00:16:39.475]  We're good old-fashioned comfort.

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.061]  Others don't.
[00:16:59.045 --> 00:17:00.927]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[00:17:00.927 --> 00:17:09.533]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.743]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.743 --> 00:18:05.525]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.525 --> 00:18:16.794]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:26.622]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.622 --> 00:18:32.707]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.707 --> 00:18:37.811]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.811 --> 00:18:40.053]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.413 --> 00:18:42.153]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.153 --> 00:18:52.136]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.136 --> 00:18:54.777]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.777 --> 00:18:59.478]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:04.983 --> 00:19:07.344]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:05.410]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:48.126 --> 00:20:50.306]  Welcome back.
[00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:59.648]  You are watching the most censored, most attacked, most under-sieged, most demonized broadcast in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:20:59.648 --> 00:21:05.690]  Much of the ish is already behind an iron curtain of the Chinese Great Firewall.
[00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:17.612]  Even Politico, we can put that article up on screen, came out and said, welcome to the age of worldwide digital censorship online, with China and the EU directing it.
[00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:38.259]  And Congress sits there sucking their thumb, saying, we're not going to regulate these private companies, meaning they leave a vacuum, and those companies are now under EU and CHICOM control, and are officially moving to China, and censoring everything here, and spying on everywhere you go and what you do.
[00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:42.361]  Google is more of a threat to our freedoms than the NSA could ever imagine.
[00:21:42.361 --> 00:21:44.321]  Apple has the worst slave factories.
[00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:46.042]  Apple pays the least taxes.
[00:21:46.042 --> 00:21:47.803]  Apple is a venomous, hateful group.
[00:21:49.551 --> 00:21:58.258]  But they camouflage themselves with gay pride parades and Black Lives Matter fundraisers.
[00:21:58.258 --> 00:22:07.165]  Absolutely wicked beyond imagination, but not a word from Tim Cook about China executing gays.
[00:22:07.165 --> 00:22:10.248]  But now they've come out of the closet, the America haters.
[00:22:11.442 --> 00:22:24.688]  If you go to the universities, or you've been brought up in the last 30, 40, 50 years in this country, most schools, most government institutions teach America-hating, Christian-hating, capitalism-hating.
[00:22:24.688 --> 00:22:28.030]  They give you a false history.
[00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:33.392]  You don't learn about the Trojan War, you don't learn about ancient China, or you don't learn about the Revolutionary War.
[00:22:33.392 --> 00:22:35.333]  You learn about America being racist.
[00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:37.074]  You learn about America being sexist.
[00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:44.895]  But it's been a big wake-up call when Governor Cuomo, who told Christians and conservatives and gun owners, get out of the state.
[00:22:44.895 --> 00:22:46.277]  People said, you're joking, two years ago.
[00:22:46.277 --> 00:22:50.981]  He goes, no, get the H out, he said.
[00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:51.401]  Remember that?
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.923]  And then, CNN and others came out to his defense, even though he backed off of it.
[00:22:57.923 --> 00:23:04.106]  He's speaking to fellow Democrats about, America's never been great, America's bad, America's mean to women.
[00:23:04.106 --> 00:23:09.190]  You need to have chips on your shoulders, and then come under my pimp's control.
[00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.350]  I'll pimp you out good.
[00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:15.954]  So that kind of blew up in his face, so he said, oh, I didn't mean it, it's out of context.
[00:23:15.954 --> 00:23:19.256]  And then, CNN and others go, no, no, no, America is bad.
[00:23:20.094 --> 00:23:24.675]  Well, that's what they're already teaching, because they want to conquer the idea of free market.
[00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:40.859]  They want to make everybody think that America isn't theirs, that they couldn't be wealthy, or successful, or free, or make their own choices, or that the potential of the American system is the most powerful potential the world's ever seen, and that we have been exceptional because of our ideals of rugged individualism.
[00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:44.880]  But they're fundamentally threatened with that.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.520]  And as Trump said, he can't imagine
[00:23:48.308 --> 00:23:51.250]  What a worse statement is from Cuomo.
[00:23:51.250 --> 00:24:02.757]  That America's never really been that great or that it will never be that great.
[00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:05.879]  He asked the question in the tweet.
[00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:13.043]  He doesn't know which one of the statements is worse.
[00:24:13.043 --> 00:24:13.984]  So let's go ahead and
[00:24:16.141 --> 00:24:18.423]  We're not going to make America great again.
[00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:19.524]  It was never that great.
[00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:24.349]  We have not reached greatness.
[00:24:24.349 --> 00:24:24.949]  We will reach greatness.
[00:24:39.454 --> 00:24:52.568]  When every American is fully engaged, we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51% of our population, is gone.
[00:24:56.127 --> 00:25:12.313]  I think points like yours that are focusing only on the negative and not even acknowledging 700,000 new jobs for black people in this country, record low unemployment and the rest of it, it's tantamount to what Andrew Cuomo said today that upset me too, that America has never been great.
[00:25:12.313 --> 00:25:14.253]  Let's focus on what we've done well.
[00:25:16.254 --> 00:25:16.835]  You know what?
[00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.750]  You know what they're doing, right?
[00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.491]  It's called demoralization.
[00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:35.451]  What's Trump trying to do?
[00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:37.071]  Get our morale up.
[00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:39.292]  We are literally being demoralized.
[00:25:39.292 --> 00:25:41.692]  When an enemy government comes in and captures a nation,
[00:26:01.172 --> 00:26:10.976]  The first thing they do is demoralize the population and tell them the worst parts of their history and harp on it and then get collaborators to come and join and say, yeah, I hate the country.
[00:26:10.976 --> 00:26:15.978]  I'll go out and work against it and help you take it over.
[00:26:15.978 --> 00:26:24.501]  That's what they do in Red Dawn at the re-education camp that is a fictional camp, but based on what real Soviet camps would do to countries they'd taken over.
[00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:27.442]  So let's put one of Trump's many tweets about Como on screen.
[00:26:27.442 --> 00:26:30.023]  I'm going to read this and there's never been truer words spoken.
[00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:30.323]  Here it is.
[00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:49.676]  How does a politician, Cuomo, known for pushing people and businesses out of his state, not to mention having the highest taxes in the U.S., survive making the statement, we're not going to make America great again.
[00:26:49.676 --> 00:26:53.039]  It was never that great.
[00:26:54.858 --> 00:26:57.619]  Which section of the sentence is worse?
[00:26:57.619 --> 00:26:58.840]  It's really hard.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.240]  Well, I think the worst part is this.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.182]  You could say America wasn't great if you had a chip on your shoulder and a twisted view and didn't understand the real complexities.
[00:27:05.182 --> 00:27:06.823]  You could say, if you were ignorant...
[00:27:07.495 --> 00:27:09.236]  That America was never great.
[00:27:09.236 --> 00:27:12.198]  I don't agree with that, it's obviously stupid and doesn't know history.
[00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:34.353]  You measure America up, all the foreign historians, Japanese, French, German, Russian, Mexican, Chilean, they all said, just incredible, romantic background, the buildings, the construction, the invention, nobody could build the Panama Canal, two countries failed, we built it, then gave it to the Chi-Coms, you know, we go in, fight countries, turn them back over to them, nobody else does that.
[00:27:34.353 --> 00:27:37.155]  But you can sit there and argue, okay, we were never great, if you're ignorant.
[00:27:38.134 --> 00:27:46.456]  But to say, and will never be great, is saying, you are a piece of crap!
[00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:47.876]  You are my slave!
[00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:48.676]  I am over you!
[00:27:48.676 --> 00:27:50.636]  We suck!
[00:27:50.636 --> 00:27:51.676]  Stay demoralized!
[00:27:51.676 --> 00:27:53.117]  Stay on assistance!
[00:27:53.117 --> 00:27:54.217]  Never get off welfare!
[00:27:54.217 --> 00:27:55.397]  I control you!
[00:27:55.397 --> 00:27:56.097]  Keep down!
[00:27:56.097 --> 00:27:57.397]  You're a nobody!
[00:27:57.397 --> 00:27:59.918]  Super negative crap!
[00:27:59.918 --> 00:28:02.238]  That is the poison of these people.
[00:28:02.238 --> 00:28:05.379]  You get around Democrats, you go to their events, they're all like this.
[00:28:06.715 --> 00:28:10.416]  They're either desperate, scared, poor people that a bunch of rich elitists look down on.
[00:28:10.416 --> 00:28:17.118]  I was telling my wife that Democrats in Congress historically have about 80% of the wealth.
[00:28:17.118 --> 00:28:19.459]  Democrats in Congress, they have most of the wealth.
[00:28:19.459 --> 00:28:20.260]  They're the rich people.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:20.800]  She goes, really?
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.360]  I thought they were the party of poor people.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.161]  I go, no.
[00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:25.841]  They're the party of keeping you poor.
[00:28:25.841 --> 00:28:27.382]  Almost every billionaire is a Democrat.
[00:28:28.914 --> 00:28:30.155]  All of them.
[00:28:30.155 --> 00:28:33.077]  Carlos Slim, the Mexican kingpin, made $5 billion off U.S.
[00:28:33.077 --> 00:28:34.859]  taxpayers for Obama phones.
[00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:36.520]  It's all a big kickback scheme.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.781]  It's all a big scam.
[00:28:37.781 --> 00:28:42.665]  They are trying to suppress you and tell you you're ugly and you're a piece of crap and make you fight with each other.
[00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:47.009]  It's in the WikiLeaks that they want to demoralize us and have race conflict.
[00:28:47.009 --> 00:28:48.250]  They're monsters!
[00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.371]  They're scum!
[00:28:49.371 --> 00:28:50.491]  They're filth!
[00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:51.953]  My God, they're the enemy!
[00:28:51.953 --> 00:28:56.857]  They are the enemy and they're planting false flags against themselves to be the victim!
[00:28:56.857 --> 00:28:58.218]  They're monster criminals!
[00:28:59.198 --> 00:29:01.839]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:02.959]  Get back to nature.

[00:33:03.772 --> 00:33:06.474]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.844 --> 00:33:17.505]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:17.505 --> 00:33:23.628]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:23.628 --> 00:33:39.174]  Okay, folks, I've got to get to the news today, because I didn't get to a lot of it the last few days, because we've been under such attack, and that's been one of the top stories in the country for two weeks, that we're under massive censorship attack, and that it's draconian, and that it's meant for everybody.
[00:33:40.459 --> 00:33:50.906]  I need to get into massive acid attacks in the UK, massive rape attacks all over Sweden, Europe, thousands of cars being burned, people being stabbed, murdered.
[00:33:50.906 --> 00:34:00.592]  This is all Islamic Jihad, but the media is covering it up and they're arresting people that point out that it's Al-Qaeda related and ISIS related.
[00:34:00.592 --> 00:34:08.237]  They are now taking people off their credit card companies here in the US if they are pro-Israel or speak out against Jihad.
[00:34:09.943 --> 00:34:13.364]  Whether you're for Israel or not, people have a right to be pro-Israel, right?
[00:34:13.364 --> 00:34:14.624]  Like Jihad Watch.
[00:34:14.624 --> 00:34:17.385]  This is really, really dangerous.
[00:34:17.385 --> 00:34:21.685]  And I told everybody that I was only the first domino.
[00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:27.047]  Even Politico has the headline that just came out yesterday.
[00:34:27.047 --> 00:34:28.267]  I hadn't seen this.
[00:34:28.267 --> 00:34:30.607]  Welcome to the new era of digital censorship.
[00:34:30.607 --> 00:34:33.768]  It's dangerous to ask tech companies to decide what's legitimate free speech.
[00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:47.590]  And they admit, and now others are admitting, and I know some big names are about to come public in defense of Infowars very strongly, because folks understand what's happening.
[00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:48.730]  And I'm going to explain it one more time.
[00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.331]  I'm going to do it in the next segment, because I want to lay all this out.
[00:34:52.331 --> 00:34:58.393]  The EU has fined tens of billions of dollars against U.S.-based tech giants.
[00:34:58.393 --> 00:35:04.535]  To get out of that, they're just moving to China, where the EU never even tries to enforce stuff, because the Chinese ignore it.
[00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:15.234]  So by creating that vacuum, Congress has allowed China and has allowed the EU particularly to take control of our Internet.
[00:35:15.234 --> 00:35:18.897]  We're now going under their policies.
[00:35:18.897 --> 00:35:23.239]  And I'm going to continue to lay it out in reports here on air, but it's in the news!
[00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:32.685]  So Congress must act under national security issues to have an Internet Bill of Rights and to say we're going to follow our own rules here and these companies that have operated like
[00:35:33.607 --> 00:35:40.789]  Utilities, and have said that they are monopolies, and have said that they are the open soapbox, digital soapbox, and the Democrats admit.
[00:35:40.789 --> 00:35:42.769]  Take Jones out of the digital soapbox.
[00:35:42.769 --> 00:35:44.310]  Take him out of the town square.
[00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.330]  Silence him.
[00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.650]  Congressmen have said it.
[00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.791]  Senators have said it, that are quarterbacking it.
[00:35:48.791 --> 00:35:53.332]  Do you understand that?
[00:35:53.332 --> 00:35:54.192]  We have the reports.
[00:35:54.192 --> 00:35:54.952]  It's all admitted.
[00:35:54.952 --> 00:36:01.074]  In fact, you guys pulled me yesterday, Shtack, where I had all the articles with the Congress and Senators saying, don't just silence Jones, silence everyone.
[00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:05.963]  And then the Republicans go, we're a free market, companies can do whatever they want.
[00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:10.126]  These are things bigger than the country combined.
[00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:19.371]  You add Apple and Google and Twitter and Facebook and another 20-something companies together, you're talking about a GDP close to the country.
[00:36:19.371 --> 00:36:21.673]  You're talking about the infrastructure of how people communicate.
[00:36:21.673 --> 00:36:27.857]  I understand the average congressperson is like 70 and still uses landlines and stuff, but baby, that ain't how we're talking.
[00:36:28.899 --> 00:36:31.780]  Well, you have a right to use a telegraph if you want, Jones.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.541]  Really?
[00:36:32.541 --> 00:36:38.283]  They're trying to get Akamai that we've used for five, six years and paid millions of dollars.
[00:36:38.283 --> 00:36:41.805]  They've had a mutiny inside Akamai.
[00:36:41.805 --> 00:36:45.527]  Telling them, don't let us buy services to stream our own video.
[00:36:45.527 --> 00:36:47.368]  They're trying to take down our credit card providers.
[00:36:47.368 --> 00:36:48.588]  Already took one down.
[00:36:48.588 --> 00:36:52.030]  We're under racketeering criminal assault.
[00:36:55.063 --> 00:36:57.203]  Now I want to make an addendum, just a little point here.
[00:36:57.203 --> 00:37:03.705]  I want to add this on to what I said earlier in the last segment, if you just joined us.
[00:37:03.705 --> 00:37:09.246]  I want to add this point in.
[00:37:09.246 --> 00:37:16.527]  The Democrats are suddenly coming out all over TV, not just Columbo, but on CNN, MSNBC, and saying, we hate America.
[00:37:16.527 --> 00:37:21.928]  And America was never great, and it will never be great, because their psychology is keeping you desperate.
[00:37:22.964 --> 00:37:26.766]  And basically at a subsistence level so that you're never independent.
[00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:28.547]  They want to arrest your development.
[00:37:28.547 --> 00:37:30.167]  They want to keep you under their control.
[00:37:30.167 --> 00:37:31.668]  They want to keep you depressed.
[00:37:31.668 --> 00:37:34.229]  CNN, MSNBC, NPR.
[00:37:34.229 --> 00:37:36.490]  I was talking to the crew during the break with a lot of Democrat friends.
[00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.331]  They go, yeah, they're all depressed.
[00:37:38.331 --> 00:37:39.452]  They think America sucks.
[00:37:39.452 --> 00:37:41.032]  They think they suck.
[00:37:41.032 --> 00:37:43.073]  Believe me, Cuomo doesn't think it sucks.
[00:37:43.073 --> 00:37:44.454]  He's ruling over you.
[00:37:44.454 --> 00:37:47.255]  Hillary doesn't think it's bad.
[00:37:47.255 --> 00:37:48.716]  Think about how bizarre that statement is.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.061]  And America will never be great.
[00:37:54.061 --> 00:37:57.202]  It's never been that great, and it'll never be great.
[00:37:57.202 --> 00:38:00.383]  Because they want you as their slaves.
[00:38:00.383 --> 00:38:03.243]  They don't want to compete in a real renaissance.
[00:38:03.243 --> 00:38:11.906]  Because control freaks like them, in Communist China, or the Democratic Party, or in Venezuela, or any of these places, get left behind.
[00:38:11.906 --> 00:38:12.586]  Take the EU.
[00:38:12.586 --> 00:38:15.667]  It's got unelected bureaucrats that set it up, that sit over it.
[00:38:16.837 --> 00:38:19.338]  They're exempt from taxes and cannot be removed.
[00:38:19.338 --> 00:38:21.139]  It's a Politburo!
[00:38:21.139 --> 00:38:23.120]  And they want to make people depressed.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.301]  They want to break down the general society.
[00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:36.205]  Everywhere Democrats and globalists and socialists are in control, you have ultra-rich people ruling over the population and rivers of crap all over the streets.
[00:38:36.205 --> 00:38:38.286]  It's what their spirit creates.
[00:38:38.286 --> 00:38:39.407]  It's what they push.
[00:38:39.407 --> 00:38:40.107]  It's what they do.
[00:38:40.107 --> 00:38:45.309]  They're trying to demoralize us like a foreign army that has captured us would do.
[00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.950]  That's the facts.
[00:38:48.823 --> 00:39:02.428]  Coming up, I'm going to get into their master plan for total censorship and how it can be stopped, and how we approach Congress with this, that they absolutely must act once they get their heads out of their rear ends.
[00:39:02.428 --> 00:39:10.311]  Because they've been mantra-ed in by the Heritage Foundation, all these groups, that it's free market to let China have 100% tariffs on us and we have none on them.
[00:39:10.311 --> 00:39:16.734]  Or it's free market to have Canada with a 280% tariff on all dairy, milk, cheese,
[00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:19.271]  Yogurt, everything.
[00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:21.672]  Tens of billions of dollars a year.
[00:39:21.672 --> 00:39:23.193]  And then we have none on them.
[00:39:23.193 --> 00:39:25.653]  That's why we've got Canadian dairy all over the U.S.
[00:39:25.653 --> 00:39:26.754]  and there's no U.S.
[00:39:26.754 --> 00:39:28.374]  dairy in Canada.
[00:39:28.374 --> 00:39:32.175]  Because it is a 100% wall, a 280% tariff.
[00:39:32.175 --> 00:39:37.777]  You cannot ever compete with that.
[00:39:37.777 --> 00:39:39.097]  Is that free market?
[00:39:39.097 --> 00:39:41.678]  No, that's the opposite of free market.
[00:39:41.678 --> 00:39:44.959]  And it's the same thing with the internet.
[00:39:46.843 --> 00:39:49.505]  They don't get involved, saying we're going to have a little playing field.
[00:39:49.505 --> 00:39:52.908]  They open up a giant vacuum.
[00:39:52.908 --> 00:39:57.071]  And Big Tech's spending a lot of money up on Capitol Hill to keep people dumb.
[00:39:57.071 --> 00:39:58.672]  Like Matt Gaetz and others.
[00:39:58.672 --> 00:40:01.775]  And they need to get smart right now, because they know what's going on.
[00:40:01.775 --> 00:40:11.783]  But they stay tone deaf to it, because they think, well, Big Tech's going to put money in my re-election campaign if I just don't get on their ass.
[00:40:11.783 --> 00:40:15.266]  You'll never get re-elected, any of you, if you don't do something about this now!
[00:40:18.206 --> 00:40:23.390]  Now, I've sacrificed to be blacklisted everywhere to tell the truth and save the country.
[00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.611]  And that's what I should do, and it's what you should do.
[00:40:25.611 --> 00:40:27.392]  Man up and start acting like men.
[00:40:27.392 --> 00:40:31.335]  Now that said, if you notice, you go to InfoWars.com now.
[00:40:31.335 --> 00:40:35.698]  We'll take three or four of the top most important videos of the day that are emergency transmissions.
[00:40:37.657 --> 00:40:39.058]  And we post them there.
[00:40:39.058 --> 00:40:40.519]  I want you to download them.
[00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:41.379]  I want you to stream them.
[00:40:41.379 --> 00:40:42.780]  I want you to put them on your own site.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.041]  I want you to edit them.
[00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.181]  Do whatever you want.
[00:40:45.181 --> 00:40:48.143]  Just magnify them and amplify them and get them out.
[00:40:48.143 --> 00:40:51.765]  And that's what people are doing all over the country and all over the world.
[00:40:51.765 --> 00:40:56.108]  It might be going into an Apple Store and putting InfoWars.com on every screen.
[00:40:56.108 --> 00:40:59.330]  Or doing it at your computer class at college.
[00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.831]  Or doing it at the airport.
[00:41:00.831 --> 00:41:02.732]  There's a video on InfoWars.com of a lady doing that.
[00:41:03.945 --> 00:41:05.505]  It's all happening.
[00:41:05.505 --> 00:41:11.607]  Or, legally and lawfully, posting handbills up that InfoWars.com is verboten.
[00:41:11.607 --> 00:41:17.228]  And it will backfire with the Streisand effect if you do that.
[00:41:17.228 --> 00:41:18.488]  And it's begun to happen.
[00:41:18.488 --> 00:41:19.388]  So I want to salute you.
[00:41:19.388 --> 00:41:21.089]  I want to thank you.
[00:41:21.089 --> 00:41:22.909]  I want to encourage you.
[00:41:22.909 --> 00:41:25.389]  And I want to ask everybody to continue it.
[00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:27.570]  But the front page of InfoWars.com every day
[00:41:28.928 --> 00:41:38.151]  Many times we'll have a special splash page with what I believe is the most critical information and then you can go to all the sites and links to the shopping cart, you name it.
[00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:43.872]  But listen, they took $3 million of our funding for the next year.
[00:41:43.872 --> 00:41:49.794]  They took away Criteo that approached us when we got kicked off AdRoll a year and a half ago.
[00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:54.011]  That is crippling and devastating.
[00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:55.312]  We need to make that money up.
[00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:56.533]  They're hitting with all these lawsuits.
[00:41:56.533 --> 00:42:01.756]  We can defeat it, and we're going to hold out, but we need you to seriously commit and understand.
[00:42:01.756 --> 00:42:02.997]  I told you we're under attack.
[00:42:02.997 --> 00:42:03.758]  You're under attack.
[00:42:03.758 --> 00:42:06.620]  When you fund us, you are funding yourself.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.001]  And do you want to see them win?
[00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:08.722]  I know you don't.
[00:42:08.722 --> 00:42:13.265]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get supplements you need.
[00:42:13.265 --> 00:42:19.670]  Get books and videos and Forbidden Information t-shirt, our latest shirt, with our
[00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:29.235]  Infowars.com at the top and then an image of myself with tape over my mouth saying, is forbidden information.
[00:42:29.235 --> 00:42:30.336]  White t-shirt and black.
[00:42:30.336 --> 00:42:33.257]  Very, very powerful message.
[00:42:33.257 --> 00:42:34.398]  It's happening.
[00:42:34.398 --> 00:42:35.639]  It's going down.
[00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:42.783]  It's here and it's up to you to strike back against it peacefully and lawfully because this is the greatest time in our lives, in our history.
[00:42:42.783 --> 00:42:45.985]  They're trying to take down America right now and if we don't win this
[00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:51.127]  Election coming up, it's going to be an even crazier fight.
[00:42:51.127 --> 00:42:56.331]  So we need to understand the next month and a half, the next two months, is so incredibly critical.
[00:42:56.331 --> 00:42:57.492]  Only what, 81 days?
[00:42:57.492 --> 00:42:58.272]  Ladies and gentlemen, 81 days.
[00:42:59.278 --> 00:43:00.478]  We knew it was coming.
[00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:02.059]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:25.384]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia, and then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news
[00:43:25.384 --> 00:43:26.425]  We're good to go.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.381]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[00:43:52.381 --> 00:43:57.483]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:43:57.483 --> 00:43:59.464]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:43:59.464 --> 00:44:04.166]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWars life.
[00:44:04.986 --> 00:44:05.907]  They take hours.
[00:44:05.907 --> 00:44:08.348]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:44:08.348 --> 00:44:09.529]  It's stronger.
[00:44:09.529 --> 00:44:11.130]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.353]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:44:14.353 --> 00:44:15.474]  It's back in stock.
[00:44:15.474 --> 00:44:18.656]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:22.438]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:44:22.438 --> 00:44:25.541]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[00:44:25.541 --> 00:44:26.441]  So you can upload it.
[00:44:26.441 --> 00:44:32.766]  And our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is
[00:44:33.426 --> 00:44:37.828]  Super blue silver immune gargle, that's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[00:44:37.828 --> 00:44:43.150]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:44.551]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:54.455]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:44:54.455 --> 00:44:57.516]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.

[00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:09.304]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:46:09.304 --> 00:46:13.005]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:46:13.005 --> 00:46:17.706]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:46:17.706 --> 00:46:20.967]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:46:21.867 --> 00:46:32.850]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:41.392]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[00:46:43.012 --> 00:46:44.613]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:32.171]  It was an inside job By the well-connected team You're a bit of protest
[00:47:50.885 --> 00:47:52.126]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:52.126 --> 00:47:59.952]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:59.952 --> 00:48:09.199]  Communist China and the EU are taking control of the Internet, not just around the world, but here in the United States.
[00:48:09.199 --> 00:48:10.660]  And Congress's inaction
[00:48:11.914 --> 00:48:33.619]  has created a huge vacuum that has green-lighted Google, Apple, and many companies that originated inside the United States to openly move to authoritarian China and to now build censorship engines to have the code keys to the Apple iCloud that's access to all of your private information in the hands of the Chinese government.
[00:48:33.619 --> 00:48:40.360]  Meanwhile, the EU is bringing in regulatory control in the name of people's privacy
[00:48:42.401 --> 00:48:43.182]  Has nothing to do with it.
[00:48:43.182 --> 00:48:55.451]  With giant fines against Google and others, and Facebook, and the billions of dollars, to make them regulatorily comply with EU rules that censor speech.
[00:48:55.451 --> 00:49:09.481]  And Facebook and others have hired former senior Stasi members, can't make this up, to help report people that criticize radical Islam, or who are nationalists, so they can be arrested and or fined.
[00:49:10.834 --> 00:49:13.473]  So I'm reaching out to Congressmen.
[00:49:14.864 --> 00:49:25.548]  Matt Gaetz and Congressman Jim Jordan and many others who seem to be intelligent and pro-American but on this subject have not really said enough because they're spinning it like, well these are private companies.
[00:49:25.548 --> 00:49:30.010]  No, they've said they operate as public squares, they operate as utilities.
[00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:33.811]  The left is saying silence conservatives from the public square.
[00:49:33.811 --> 00:49:35.592]  They admit that I am the first domino.
[00:49:35.592 --> 00:49:38.193]  I'll show you some news articles, mainstream news here in a minute.
[00:49:38.193 --> 00:49:40.554]  It's not just Alex Jones saying it.
[00:49:40.554 --> 00:49:43.395]  And I'm being silenced because I've been beating the drum for this.
[00:49:44.935 --> 00:49:45.896]  What should Congress do?
[00:49:45.896 --> 00:49:49.340]  Well, you should hold hearings on the subject.
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:55.588]  And you should look at how many members of Congress themselves have been completely shadow banned or have been governed, curtailed down over 90%.
[00:49:55.588 --> 00:50:04.138]  And that Breitbart studies show, conservative sites on Facebook, Google and Apple platforms, like Breitbart and
[00:50:04.979 --> 00:50:12.442]  The Daily Caller and others have been cut back 93% from 80% just a few months ago on their reach.
[00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:15.023]  They're not letting people communicate.
[00:50:15.023 --> 00:50:21.785]  They're not letting users on Facebook go to the Breitbart website or the InfoWars website and share it.
[00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:26.707]  They're getting in front of them preemptively.
[00:50:26.707 --> 00:50:28.848]  These companies engage in false advertising.
[00:50:30.005 --> 00:50:34.066]  They advertise as the public square as long as you've played by their rules.
[00:50:34.066 --> 00:50:43.189]  But their rules are all subjectively put into place by SJW leftists that have been hired to run and captain these systems.
[00:50:43.189 --> 00:50:55.293]  So again, Congress and the President's inaction, and we the people's inaction, has created a vacuum and a perfect storm where dying dinosaur media, the scared Democratic Party,
[00:50:56.175 --> 00:51:03.240]  That the public's realigning against, and foreign governments have now colluded to bring in total internet control.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:10.366]  I know Congress is aware that Senator Warner has circulated plans to have the Democrats take over the web if they win the midterms.
[00:51:10.366 --> 00:51:17.391]  I'm sure you've seen Senator Murphy say that, quote, I'm the tip of an iceberg of conservative news that needs to be banned.
[00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:19.373]  I'm sure you know all this is going on.
[00:51:20.782 --> 00:51:29.424]  I'm sure you know that Google's moving to China and setting up a censorship search engine there and that their own executives have leaked in mainstream news here, but it got no attention.
[00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:35.312]  That they're helping set up censorship engines here, because they're going to unify it with China.
[00:51:35.312 --> 00:51:38.373]  China is now the giant sucking sound.
[00:51:38.373 --> 00:51:59.822]  And because we won't stand up for true net neutrality, and because we won't stand up for a true Internet Bill of Rights, we're no longer the leader in the world by advocating our responsibility by stepping down and letting China and the EU and the big banks and corrupt Silicon Valley, trained by the big universities, the big America-hating groups, to want to silence
[00:52:01.331 --> 00:52:03.313]  Flyover country.
[00:52:03.313 --> 00:52:04.714]  This is devastating information.
[00:52:04.714 --> 00:52:06.895]  Here's some of the articles just today.
[00:52:06.895 --> 00:52:11.339]  Twitter purges accounts across the platform again.
[00:52:11.339 --> 00:52:14.121]  Anyone that had ever had any strikes or ever had any problems?
[00:52:14.121 --> 00:52:16.223]  Well, now you're being completely banned.
[00:52:16.223 --> 00:52:24.890]  Social media platform Twitter has begun banning a large number of accounts from the website, specifically focusing on accounts that have previously been banned or have received suspensions.
[00:52:26.101 --> 00:52:28.063]  And they're going after everybody.
[00:52:28.063 --> 00:52:30.645]  From Gavin McGinnis to Laura Loomer.
[00:52:30.645 --> 00:52:31.846]  And then continuing here.
[00:52:31.846 --> 00:52:32.346]  Here's another one.
[00:52:32.346 --> 00:52:33.187]  Politico.
[00:52:33.187 --> 00:52:35.909]  Welcome to the new era of global digital censorship.
[00:52:35.909 --> 00:52:39.512]  It's dangerous to ask tech companies to decide what's legitimate free speech.
[00:52:39.512 --> 00:52:40.132]  Well, they don't.
[00:52:40.132 --> 00:52:48.159]  The Democratic Party, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, Snopes, Media Matters run by George Soros.
[00:52:48.159 --> 00:52:50.681]  They all have created databases
[00:52:52.338 --> 00:52:58.182]  They have now been brought in as the fact checkers to flag information!
[00:52:58.182 --> 00:53:03.605]  And then you know the famous disinfo that they're constantly getting caught involved in.
[00:53:03.605 --> 00:53:05.666]  If the sky is blue, they say it's red.
[00:53:05.666 --> 00:53:14.291]  So I'm asking Congress, I'm asking the public, I'm asking everyone to take this information and to investigate it yourself and to do something because the First Amendment is so critical.
[00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:17.553]  And I want to add this right now.
[00:53:17.553 --> 00:53:18.694]  We're live on Friday.
[00:53:20.472 --> 00:53:22.754]  But we're going to take the video report here.
[00:53:22.754 --> 00:53:29.458]  We're going to post it on the front page of InfoWars.com along with other key reports that all of you can go get the link to.
[00:53:29.458 --> 00:53:33.621]  We're going to post them as articles on InfoWars.com.
[00:53:33.621 --> 00:53:37.344]  And we need you to send these video reports to Congress.
[00:53:37.344 --> 00:53:39.426]  We need you to go to the Congressman's
[00:53:40.492 --> 00:53:44.019]  Facebooks, their Twitters, everywhere, and communicate with them.
[00:53:44.019 --> 00:53:52.975]  They're trying to censor us, but they can't stop you going around them directly to them digitally, or directly to the Capitol, or directly to their home offices.
[00:53:54.195 --> 00:54:05.683]  Go in, sit down with their Chief of Staff, go sit down with their people and show them this, and whoever does this will be the champion of the First Amendment, and will get incredible support from the left and right.
[00:54:05.683 --> 00:54:10.127]  The left, at the grassroots level, who aren't complete tyrants, are upset about this.
[00:54:10.127 --> 00:54:12.328]  Noam Chomsky's upset about this.
[00:54:12.328 --> 00:54:14.510]  This is dangerous, folks.
[00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:16.291]  This is serious.
[00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:18.633]  Again, Apple banned Alex Jones, InfoWars.
[00:54:18.633 --> 00:54:20.314]  Then the dominoes started to fall.
[00:54:20.314 --> 00:54:22.316]  Vox calls for everything I do to be banned.
[00:54:23.208 --> 00:54:26.389]  And then now they brag, get rid of all the conservatives.
[00:54:26.389 --> 00:54:34.192]  And I've got articles in my stack today where congressional candidates across the country aren't even allowed to communicate on Facebook or Twitter with their users.
[00:54:34.192 --> 00:54:36.053]  They can't put out their campaign ads.
[00:54:36.053 --> 00:54:37.053]  Those are blocked.
[00:54:37.053 --> 00:54:38.634]  They can't even pay to have them run.
[00:54:38.634 --> 00:54:42.575]  But Democrats can all run their ads.
[00:54:42.575 --> 00:54:46.136]  Now that is a donation in kind.
[00:54:46.136 --> 00:54:47.577]  Imagine if ABC
[00:54:48.891 --> 00:54:55.516]  National News, you tried to buy a political ad with them, and they said no, but then they took your competitor's ad.
[00:54:55.516 --> 00:55:03.322]  Imagine a local CBS affiliate, you tried to go buy a bunch of ads for your run for governor, say, in Massachusetts.
[00:55:03.322 --> 00:55:08.786]  They say, we're not letting you because you're a Republican, but we're gonna let the Democrat run.
[00:55:08.786 --> 00:55:14.811]  Come on folks, this is racketeering, this is unfair trade practices, this is criminal, this is corrupt, this is out of control.
[00:55:16.496 --> 00:55:25.384]  And these ads that are being run, the one we're showing right now, are Asian Americans and others showing their families and how they love America and how they're winners and how they're not victims.
[00:55:25.384 --> 00:55:33.851]  And the Democrats are saying, you're not going to run those ads because you're telling America that they're not demoralized.
[00:55:33.851 --> 00:55:35.553]  You're telling America they're winners.
[00:55:35.553 --> 00:55:38.015]  You're telling America that you're doing a great job.
[00:55:38.015 --> 00:55:42.359]  And the ad we're showing right now for TV viewers, for radio listeners on Infowars.com, it's been banned.
[00:55:43.831 --> 00:55:49.453]  Good, wholesome ads of Congresswomen from Tennessee talking about how they love America, how they love their family.
[00:55:49.453 --> 00:55:58.097]  And good conservative candidates from places like New York, banned from even advertising, banned from the marketplace.
[00:55:58.097 --> 00:56:01.859]  Oh, but they're private companies, they can do what they want.
[00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:04.480]  So the newspaper wouldn't take your money to run an ad?
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.720]  That wouldn't be unfair trade practices?
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:06.741]  That wouldn't be discrimination?
[00:56:06.741 --> 00:56:07.881]  That wouldn't be a scandal?
[00:56:07.881 --> 00:56:09.202]  That wouldn't be something you'd talk about?
[00:56:11.653 --> 00:56:14.075]  Congress is asleep at the switch, and this is the big issue.
[00:56:14.075 --> 00:56:18.599]  The President has tried, he's spoken some about how shadow banning's illegal.
[00:56:18.599 --> 00:56:25.025]  Twitter's just playing games with me right now to act like I violated their rules so they can go on the news and misrepresent what I've said and not show it.
[00:56:25.025 --> 00:56:28.568]  Jack Dorsey, you know Jones, says he wants to kill the media with guns.
[00:56:28.568 --> 00:56:31.350]  I know it's terrible, but I suspended him for it.
[00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:33.472]  So when they do finally ban me, it looks legitimate.
[00:56:33.472 --> 00:56:35.294]  I never threaten anybody with guns, it's a lie!
[00:56:36.857 --> 00:56:40.599]  I said Antifa says they're coming to your house to kill Congress members and law enforcement.
[00:56:40.599 --> 00:56:42.580]  Have your firearms ready to protect yourself.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:43.820]  That's the Second Amendment.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.202]  But it's, everything's like a big university now.
[00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:48.643]  A big brainwashing center.
[00:56:48.643 --> 00:56:51.264]  Congress should take action on the universities being anti-free speech.
[00:56:51.264 --> 00:56:55.386]  These bullies, these mobs of betas are out of control.
[00:56:55.386 --> 00:56:56.927]  You know, in the land of the beta, male.
[00:57:00.233 --> 00:57:02.276]  These mobs of little cowards are kings.
[00:57:02.276 --> 00:57:05.039]  In the land of the beta male, censorship is numero uno.
[00:57:05.039 --> 00:57:08.504]  In the land of the beta male, Brian Stelter is God.
[00:57:08.504 --> 00:57:14.532]  But in the land of rebels, the land of freedom, the land of success, the land of alpha males, InfoWars is number one!
[00:57:15.233 --> 00:57:16.654]  We are proud to be rebels.
[00:57:16.654 --> 00:57:17.895]  We're proud to be hunted.
[00:57:17.895 --> 00:57:19.276]  We're proud to be attacked.
[00:57:19.276 --> 00:57:20.897]  I'm honored to be in the crosshairs.
[00:57:20.897 --> 00:57:24.060]  I swore before God that I would stand against the globalists.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:31.185]  And as long as God gives me strength and air in my lungs and my big red heart full of light, I'll march on forward.
[00:57:31.185 --> 00:57:33.887]  Stumbling sometimes, but always with grim determination.
[00:57:33.887 --> 00:57:35.148]  Climbing the hill.
[00:57:35.148 --> 00:57:37.790]  Always getting stronger even as I get weaker.
[00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:40.412]  Even as I prepare to go into our final launch phase.
[00:57:41.212 --> 00:57:43.054]  The enemy is sharpening their knives.
[00:57:43.054 --> 00:57:47.177]  I enter the arena with love in my heart and light in my eyes.
[00:57:47.177 --> 00:57:47.817]  Please support us.
[00:57:47.817 --> 00:57:50.019]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:50.019 --> 00:57:54.603]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:57:54.603 --> 00:57:55.163]  Thanks for holding.
[00:57:55.163 --> 00:57:56.244]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:57:56.244 --> 00:58:00.267]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[00:58:00.267 --> 00:58:04.851]  I remember back when Infowars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen.
[00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:05.651]  Thank you very much!
[00:58:25.724 --> 00:58:34.332]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:58:34.332 --> 00:58:39.237]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:58:39.237 --> 00:58:44.842]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[00:58:50.333 --> 00:58:58.045]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:58.045 --> 00:58:58.526]  It's you!
[00:58:59.614 --> 00:59:01.816]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.816 --> 00:59:10.562]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.562 --> 00:59:15.105]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:15.105 --> 00:59:16.566]  You are the info war.
[00:59:16.566 --> 00:59:20.089]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.769 --> 00:59:32.157]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:32.157 --> 00:59:40.122]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:40.122 --> 00:59:47.167]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.929]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.269 --> 00:59:55.861]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.372 --> 01:00:10.378]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:00:10.378 --> 01:00:23.469]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:28.733]  Trans-dimensionally, over the space-time continuance, or full space-time.
[01:00:28.733 --> 01:00:33.076]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:00:33.076 --> 01:00:37.099]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[01:00:37.847 --> 01:00:54.178]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling!
[01:00:54.178 --> 01:00:55.279]  InfoWars.
[01:00:55.279 --> 01:00:56.460]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:56.880]  Today.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.343]  Alright, let me take some time out here.
[01:01:02.438 --> 01:01:05.784]  To just explain something to listeners who've been listening a long time.
[01:01:05.784 --> 01:01:12.195]  I tend to repeat a lot of things even though I have hundreds of riveting videos and articles that are all incredibly important.
[01:01:12.195 --> 01:01:13.597]  And if I was just trying to entertain people...
[01:01:14.551 --> 01:01:16.212]  I can make the show a lot more entertaining.
[01:01:16.212 --> 01:01:19.394]  In fact, I ought to, one day a week, call it Entertainment News.
[01:01:19.394 --> 01:01:32.681]  And by that, it'll be real news, but the stuff that's, I think, most interesting, like people shooting home intruders, and a guy trying to acid attack people getting beat up by vigilantes, and, you know, just every five minutes, some riveting, incredible stuff.
[01:01:32.681 --> 01:01:35.123]  I could do that all day.
[01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:42.487]  But instead, I strategically, like it's a wartime emergency report, try to leverage you, the incredible audience,
[01:01:44.336 --> 01:01:47.698]  Hey, Congress doesn't understand there's a vacuum.
[01:01:47.698 --> 01:02:00.065]  And China and the unelected EU are both coming into that and taking control of regulation because they can put massive pressure on U.S.-based companies to move there and to roll over to them and to shut everybody down.
[01:02:00.065 --> 01:02:00.665]  That's happening.
[01:02:00.665 --> 01:02:05.027]  So, it'd be like saying, oh, Lockheed Martin's a private company.
[01:02:05.027 --> 01:02:07.869]  Oh, this is a really important part.
[01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:09.350]  I ought to add this to the earlier video.
[01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:14.615]  I'm going to add this to both reports that we just did live that I'm going to put up later to send to Congress.
[01:02:14.615 --> 01:02:15.776]  Let's add this point.
[01:02:15.776 --> 01:02:24.062]  You know, Congress, they keep saying, oh, we're private companies, let us censor all the conservatives and not let Republicans run ads on our platforms and all this crazy stuff.
[01:02:24.062 --> 01:02:34.150]  But if Lockheed Martin, which builds a lot of our secret spacecraft and weapons systems and the rest of it, if they said, hey, we're a private company, we can do whatever we want, we're going to give China
[01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.092]  Everything we've got.
[01:02:36.092 --> 01:02:38.514]  We're gonna give them our hunter-killer satellites.
[01:02:38.514 --> 01:02:42.358]  We're gonna give them our supersonic missiles.
[01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.700]  We're gonna give them our avionics.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:49.846]  We're gonna give them the codes so they can run all of our GPS satellites.
[01:02:49.846 --> 01:02:51.108]  Congress would laugh at you.
[01:02:52.403 --> 01:03:01.430]  They've been taken to all the Heritage Foundation dinners and stuff and taught, China having 100% tariff on us, or Canada 280%, that's free marketing.
[01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:11.277]  Well, Google and Apple and Twitter and Facebook, they're all free companies, so they're allowed to censor whoever they want and then throw the election for the Democrats.
[01:03:11.277 --> 01:03:13.919]  They are national security infrastructure.
[01:03:13.919 --> 01:03:15.660]  They said they were infrastructure.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:20.024]  They told to get Obama to pass all those laws three years ago to give them immunity.
[01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:22.370]  That they were a public utility.
[01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:25.653]  We all had a right to the Internet.
[01:03:25.653 --> 01:03:38.183]  And now they've used that combine, that cartel of monopolies, the worst constellation, oligopoly combines, read your history books, to openly try to bar everybody from the marketplace.
[01:03:38.183 --> 01:03:45.388]  So again, oh, is it free market that Boeing can just, you know, give all its secrets away to China?
[01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:48.711]  Or how about the other defense contractors?
[01:03:52.352 --> 01:03:53.936]  And he'd be like, no, that's insane.
[01:03:53.936 --> 01:04:00.552]  How did we allow the same law firm that sued Remington, our oldest firearm company, out of business, that's suing me?
[01:04:02.056 --> 01:04:03.616]  With the same Sandy Hook parents.
[01:04:03.616 --> 01:04:11.538]  How did Congress, how did the government allow Remington, that makes the .308 rifles used by our snipers, to be bankrupted?
[01:04:11.538 --> 01:04:20.960]  How do we allow our critical infrastructure, how do we allow our last lead smelting mine in Colorado five years ago to close?
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.121]  So China has all of the lead smelting.
[01:04:23.121 --> 01:04:26.721]  We can't even produce bullets in this country.
[01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:29.322]  We have to buy it from China and then put the jackets on them.
[01:04:30.305 --> 01:04:33.768]  We have been strategically sabotaged.
[01:04:33.768 --> 01:04:38.071]  And it needs to stop.
[01:04:38.071 --> 01:04:38.711]  It's unbelievable.
[01:04:38.711 --> 01:04:39.892]  It's so obvious.
[01:04:39.892 --> 01:04:42.394]  Oh, private company.
[01:04:42.394 --> 01:04:46.377]  Let all these defense contractors, let all these companies give all our secrets away.
[01:04:46.377 --> 01:04:47.058]  Are they a private company?
[01:04:47.058 --> 01:04:47.678]  No.
[01:04:47.678 --> 01:04:52.442]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break with a ton of critical news and information.
[01:04:52.442 --> 01:04:54.103]  Please, however you're watching, spread the links.
[01:04:54.103 --> 01:04:55.264]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:04:55.264 --> 01:04:55.985]  They can't stop you.
[01:04:58.154 --> 01:05:18.127]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.127 --> 01:05:20.249]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:24.251]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.251 --> 01:05:25.272]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:05:25.692 --> 01:05:31.496]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.496 --> 01:05:33.878]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.878 --> 01:05:36.519]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:39.321]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.321 --> 01:05:42.283]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:42.283 --> 01:05:51.009]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.009 --> 01:05:55.452]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:05.575 --> 01:06:12.457]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[01:06:12.457 --> 01:06:17.778]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[01:06:17.778 --> 01:06:19.459]  Curfew is now in place.
[01:06:19.459 --> 01:06:20.539]  Return to your homes.
[01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:32.754]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:32.754 --> 01:06:40.680]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.522]  You know, when Sadiq Khan, the Islamist mayor,
[01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:48.744]  The President of London got elected two years ago.
[01:06:48.744 --> 01:06:55.227]  The first thing he did was ban images of women in swimwear on government billboards and property.
[01:06:55.227 --> 01:07:02.752]  And in London, the City of London and also the Queen of England owns some of the City of London, they make a lot of money off of billboards.
[01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:08.255]  So they said any women in bathing suits, not just bikinis, that is now banned.
[01:07:10.937 --> 01:07:12.339]  And Paul Watson tweeted this out the other day.
[01:07:12.339 --> 01:07:13.300]  See if you can find it.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.041]  He tweeted it out yesterday.
[01:07:15.041 --> 01:07:16.983]  It shows women in bikinis.
[01:07:16.983 --> 01:07:18.925]  Actual ads banned in London.
[01:07:18.925 --> 01:07:22.468]  Women in full bathing suits banned in London.
[01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:24.017]  There it is.
[01:07:24.017 --> 01:07:27.119]  Sadiq Khan moved to ban body shaming ads in London Transport.
[01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:28.139]  And he did.
[01:07:28.139 --> 01:07:30.020]  But Paul Watson shows what's banned.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.221]  But then the burka isn't.
[01:07:32.221 --> 01:07:38.165]  Women forced to fully cover their bodies or they get beaten, even killed.
[01:07:38.165 --> 01:07:43.007]  And of course they have their genitals cut off as well when they're young girls or get acid thrown on their faces.
[01:07:43.007 --> 01:07:45.628]  That's all wonderful.
[01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:46.349]  That's all good.
[01:07:47.441 --> 01:08:01.768]  And I have articles here out of the UK where their crime rate's the highest ever recorded, worse than New York City, but prosecutions are at all-time lows, and they just let these people run around and do whatever they want.
[01:08:01.768 --> 01:08:15.835]  So that's why this is so insane, is that Sadiq Khan says you can't have women in government advertising, that is, in government-owned buildings, government-owned buses, government-owned billboards,
[01:08:18.086 --> 01:08:21.876]  You can't show women in bathing suits or men with their shirts off.
[01:08:21.876 --> 01:08:23.340]  I forgot that part.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.887]  But we can put burkas over women's heads.
[01:08:27.028 --> 01:08:27.648]  That's okay.
[01:08:27.648 --> 01:08:29.489]  See how sick this is?
[01:08:29.489 --> 01:08:30.710]  And the left's all into that.
[01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.032]  They're becoming like the super right wing with all the modesty stuff.
[01:08:34.032 --> 01:08:51.461]  The lady they've got named Steele, Pulitzer Prize winner, it's like being given an Iron Cross these days, she wrote an article about how some company had a pool parlor, people in bathing suits, and so, you know, the sexual harassment because some of the women weighed 400 pounds and they were embarrassed that other women were wearing bikinis.
[01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.923]  So, that's the next level of this cult.
[01:08:54.892 --> 01:09:07.062]  Just like colleges everywhere are taking down images of the football players, you know, and muscular males off field house walls, or like old quarterbacks that were there 20 years ago, because that's threatening, because the beta cucks, they're threatened by it.
[01:09:07.062 --> 01:09:12.226]  So, it's all about those that are the victims, those that are controlled by the globalists.
[01:09:12.226 --> 01:09:17.770]  Coming together and telling us you can't say mother, you can't say father, you can't be strong, masculinity doesn't exist.
[01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:21.493]  Remember that video of that UT professor telling Owen Schroer, masculinity doesn't exist?
[01:09:21.493 --> 01:09:23.995]  Oh, sorry, you can't see it.
[01:09:28.308 --> 01:09:30.950]  You can't see it because YouTube deleted it.
[01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:41.519]  So, let's go over the whole Islamic situation because Sadiq Khan also said, don't worry, just get used to the Islamic terror attacks.
[01:09:41.519 --> 01:09:43.541]  He said that a lot.
[01:09:43.541 --> 01:09:44.321]  And in a way, it's true.
[01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:48.750]  The acid attacks, the stabbings, the car crashes, the attacks.
[01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.491]  We don't even cover one out of a hundred now.
[01:09:50.491 --> 01:09:52.773]  And it turns out, oh, this guy was from Sudan.
[01:09:52.773 --> 01:09:54.174]  Oh, this guy was from Somalia.
[01:09:54.174 --> 01:09:55.275]  This guy was from Iraq.
[01:09:55.275 --> 01:10:00.459]  Oh, this guy was an ISIS member that put women into sex slavery.
[01:10:00.459 --> 01:10:08.324]  And now, on a German street, Yazidi ex-sex slave, right by hundreds and hundreds of ISIS men,
[01:10:10.888 --> 01:10:26.199]  Trapped both in Iraq and in German exile, runs into the man that held her as a sex slave, now on full welfare as a refugee.
[01:10:26.199 --> 01:10:33.884]  Can you imagine what it's like for these women?
[01:10:33.884 --> 01:10:37.927]  It is unbelievable.
[01:10:37.927 --> 01:10:40.129]  I can't even cover a tenth of this now.
[01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:46.420]  But when we do, we get banned off Twitter, Facebook, you name it.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:53.052]  When they banned me off Vimeo last week, some little failed video thing, we were putting stuff out anywhere we can.
[01:10:55.302 --> 01:10:57.043]  You know, we don't lay down.
[01:10:57.043 --> 01:10:59.224]  We fight.
[01:10:59.224 --> 01:10:59.865]  We fail.
[01:10:59.865 --> 01:11:01.726]  We die trying.
[01:11:01.726 --> 01:11:03.447]  And they... I read the letter on air.
[01:11:03.447 --> 01:11:11.712]  It said, you falsely claimed that an Islamic training camp had been found and that they were training, reportedly training, to take on the police and shoot up schools.
[01:11:11.712 --> 01:11:13.693]  I mean, that was all over the news.
[01:11:13.693 --> 01:11:20.637]  But just like the illegal alien that shot Kate Steinle in the back, and they virtue-singled in San Francisco and said, you're allowed to shoot her in the back.
[01:11:20.637 --> 01:11:22.218]  She's allowed to die in her father's arms.
[01:11:22.218 --> 01:11:22.779]  You go free.
[01:11:24.005 --> 01:11:26.727]  They versus signal the judge said, no, it's racist.
[01:11:26.727 --> 01:11:28.428]  You're black and Muslim.
[01:11:28.428 --> 01:11:30.329]  If you'd have been white, you wouldn't get in trouble.
[01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:38.115]  An underground giant training base with the kids telling police we're being trained to shoot up schools and people that had disappeared from different states being held there.
[01:11:38.115 --> 01:11:46.581]  And a three year old found dead on the property in underground tunnels who died in a ritual of torturing him.
[01:11:46.581 --> 01:11:51.344]  They're now reporting to bring forth the prophet Jesus and make him be reborn.
[01:11:54.085 --> 01:12:05.354]  Don't worry, the local liberal government has brought in tens of thousands of tons of sand and is using bulldozers to cover the compound.
[01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:17.604]  And they said if you were white, you would not be in jail if a dead three-year-old reportedly killed in a ritual to make him turn into Jesus.
[01:12:17.604 --> 01:12:20.166]  And they're now releasing him on
[01:12:21.977 --> 01:12:28.679]  $2,000 bond, $20,000 he's gonna pay too, but the judge did a waiver, no money paid.
[01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:33.180]  Do you hear what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.921]  Do you hear what I just said?
[01:12:36.921 --> 01:12:45.164]  I guarantee you this would never happen, but let's say I knock my wife's teeth out.
[01:12:47.094 --> 01:12:50.016]  I would end up being in jail for a couple weeks.
[01:12:50.016 --> 01:12:53.297]  And then I'd end up getting a serious conviction.
[01:12:53.297 --> 01:12:55.318]  And then maybe serve probation.
[01:12:55.318 --> 01:13:16.049]  But, I mean, you got a dead little kid where they say, we were making him become the prophet Jesus to be reborn, it was a ritual of trial, they were torturing the child reportedly for days, and some whacked out super kook voodoo from New York, that's where these guys are from, meets Islam, they're all tied into the
[01:13:17.009 --> 01:13:19.811]  Co-conspirator of the World Trade Center.
[01:13:19.811 --> 01:13:20.972]  It's all confirmed.
[01:13:20.972 --> 01:13:23.194]  They believe they're Islamic royalty.
[01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:33.981]  They're complete loon whack jobs that reportedly tortured a three-year-old to death.
[01:13:33.981 --> 01:13:36.423]  And the judge goes, you're being discriminated against.
[01:13:36.423 --> 01:13:41.747]  You may go free from your underground tunnels.
[01:13:41.747 --> 01:13:45.610]  Children of Linda Sorcerer's mentor arrested for terrorist training camp.
[01:13:46.806 --> 01:13:49.106]  But it's okay.
[01:13:49.106 --> 01:13:54.608]  Just like... Cruz.
[01:13:54.608 --> 01:13:56.428]  In Florida, the mass shooter.
[01:13:56.428 --> 01:14:00.349]  He'd been arrested, he'd threatened to kill people, he'd robbed people, he'd vandalized.
[01:14:00.349 --> 01:14:02.249]  And they said, well, his last name's Cruz.
[01:14:02.249 --> 01:14:06.570]  We have a new program where minorities don't go to jail the first 15 times or so.
[01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.070]  He's not even a minority.
[01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:12.291]  That's why the last name Cruz adopted his ass.
[01:14:12.291 --> 01:14:14.372]  He was on Prozac, all this other stuff.
[01:14:14.372 --> 01:14:15.852]  The same story over and over again, isn't it?
[01:14:18.502 --> 01:14:23.344]  And they let him go, and they let him do it, and the police stood down yet again.
[01:14:23.344 --> 01:14:24.384]  It's the same deal.
[01:14:24.384 --> 01:14:25.525]  Oh, you're a black Muslim.
[01:14:25.525 --> 01:14:28.926]  Well, we found a dead, tortured three-year-old on your property.
[01:14:28.926 --> 01:14:38.350]  They're like, well, we were going to make him become Jesus, but Jesus had to go through the ritual of the cat-or-nine-tails and the crucifixion.
[01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:42.232]  Oh, well, you just tortured a three-year-old to death.
[01:14:42.232 --> 01:14:45.393]  Well, we didn't understand.
[01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:47.314]  Let us release you immediately.
[01:14:53.504 --> 01:14:58.728]  And Governor Cuomo is on TV saying, America was never great and it will never be great, close quote.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.664]  And then I say, Antifa says they're coming to kill congressmen and the president at their houses.
[01:15:08.664 --> 01:15:10.926]  They should all have rifles ready to protect themselves.
[01:15:10.926 --> 01:15:13.388]  That turns into Alex Jones is threatening to attack the media.
[01:15:13.388 --> 01:15:14.909]  And Lester Holt doesn't quote me.
[01:15:14.909 --> 01:15:17.311]  He just goes, Jones is coming to kill us with guns.
[01:15:17.311 --> 01:15:18.732]  I'm scared.
[01:15:18.732 --> 01:15:20.713]  And Jack Dorsey goes, I know, I know.
[01:15:20.713 --> 01:15:23.696]  America was never great.
[01:15:23.696 --> 01:15:24.957]  It will never be great.
[01:15:30.247 --> 01:15:40.294]  We ought to play the clips from, you know, that are based on real stuff in the Soviet Union, where it's like, America was a crap hole and it's horrible, in Red Dawn.
[01:15:40.294 --> 01:15:48.439]  Can you pull up the concentration camp scene from Red Dawn, where they go see their family, and in the background, like, America is a pigsty of filth and crap was never great.
[01:15:48.439 --> 01:15:55.124]  And then meanwhile, it's not Red Dawn the movie, it's Governor Cuomo to Democrats, and when he says America sucks, they go, yay!
[01:15:55.124 --> 01:15:55.944]  Oh, yes!

[01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:31.558]  What if I told you
[01:17:31.578 --> 01:17:31.958]  We're good to go.

[01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:55.916]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:16.841 --> 01:20:21.844]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:20:21.844 --> 01:20:25.867]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:20:25.867 --> 01:20:27.928]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:20:27.928 --> 01:20:30.130]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:32.131]  John has a long mustache.
[01:20:32.131 --> 01:20:34.172]  John has a long mustache.
[01:20:34.172 --> 01:20:37.034]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:20:37.034 --> 01:20:41.157]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:20:47.031 --> 01:20:48.932]  But they took a lot of people away.
[01:20:48.932 --> 01:20:51.053]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[01:20:51.053 --> 01:20:54.254]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:20:54.254 --> 01:20:55.635]  Where?
[01:20:55.635 --> 01:20:57.876]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:20:57.876 --> 01:21:05.679]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:21:05.679 --> 01:21:09.841]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:21:11.607 --> 01:21:16.350]  And we need a good cast that you all run.
[01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:17.190]  I mean, really.
[01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:20.552]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[01:21:20.552 --> 01:21:25.635]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[01:21:25.635 --> 01:21:27.756]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[01:21:27.756 --> 01:21:29.337]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:21:29.637 --> 01:21:31.439]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:21:31.439 --> 01:21:32.459]  would you see that happening?
[01:21:32.459 --> 01:21:37.103]  We've got a lot of constitutionless and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:21:37.103 --> 01:21:47.052]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:21:47.052 --> 01:21:53.077]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:21:53.077 --> 01:21:57.621]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.962]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[01:22:06.962 --> 01:22:12.025]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:22:12.025 --> 01:22:15.208]  Put your gun down, really?
[01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:20.211]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:22:20.211 --> 01:22:22.032]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:22:22.032 --> 01:22:23.994]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:22:26.710 --> 01:22:32.253]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[01:22:32.253 --> 01:22:35.014]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[01:22:35.014 --> 01:22:39.496]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:40.977]  I always thought
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.981]  Folks came to take over the country, Americans would stand up.
[01:22:59.981 --> 01:23:02.002]  It's not being done militarily.
[01:23:02.002 --> 01:23:14.025]  It's being done with propaganda.
[01:23:14.025 --> 01:23:25.609]  So imagine the parallels of a Red Dawn and a re-education camp where they were showing, based on reports, what would go on in Soviet or Chinese re-education camps, bad-mouthing
[01:23:26.758 --> 01:23:28.941]  The previous system, the previous government.
[01:23:28.941 --> 01:23:30.223]  That's what they teach at universities.
[01:23:30.223 --> 01:23:31.584]  America sucks.
[01:23:31.584 --> 01:23:33.387]  It's horrible.
[01:23:33.387 --> 01:23:34.268]  It's bad.
[01:23:34.268 --> 01:23:38.193]  And so Cuomo and CNN and MSNBC all come out and say, we hate America.
[01:23:38.193 --> 01:23:39.374]  You know, America was never great.
[01:23:39.374 --> 01:23:41.137]  It's never going to be great because you're not great.
[01:23:42.708 --> 01:23:44.929]  Because they want full control of everything.
[01:23:44.929 --> 01:23:46.149]  They want to overthrow it.
[01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.969]  They want to dominate.
[01:23:46.969 --> 01:23:49.229]  It's a classic playbook they're playing.
[01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:56.871]  So I thought we'd play a few clips just to remind folks from the original 1980s Red Dawn, which now you see it.
[01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:58.091]  The enemy didn't come from without.
[01:23:58.091 --> 01:24:03.413]  As our founder said, the enemy came from within.
[01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:06.253]  And we've got, under the Democrats and Obama, leaked Army document.
[01:24:06.253 --> 01:24:08.114]  They admit it was real.
[01:24:08.114 --> 01:24:08.954]  That came out, what?
[01:24:10.054 --> 01:24:14.798]  Six years ago, that Obama was training the military to confiscate guns and put Americans in camps.
[01:24:14.798 --> 01:24:17.120]  But that woke our military up.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.963]  The fact that even top brass, who were globalists, saw that and said, we're not doing this.
[01:24:20.963 --> 01:24:27.408]  That began to get it to where Infowars was so listened to, because I was saying this on the outside, it was happening on the inside.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.461]  So now we have a beachhead to take the government back.
[01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:40.667]  We're seeing the full forces of the CHICOMs, the EU, Hollywood, the big banks, trying to maintain control over America, trying to force us back into submission.
[01:24:40.667 --> 01:24:42.828]  And they'll never get away with it now.
[01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.749]  It can still get really bad.
[01:24:44.749 --> 01:24:47.851]  They're going to stage some false flags clearly and blame me and blame Trump.
[01:24:47.851 --> 01:24:48.412]  That's very clear.
[01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:50.653]  But it's not going to work.
[01:24:50.653 --> 01:24:52.295]  This is not 1995.
[01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:53.857]  That dog won't hunt.
[01:24:53.857 --> 01:25:00.183]  But if I worked at one of these big tech companies or federal buildings or mainstream media, you need to be watching very careful.
[01:25:00.183 --> 01:25:08.551]  You need to be, you know, you pick up on something, you need to warn people and get out of there quickly because, let me tell you, right now you are, there's 81 days left till this election.
[01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:10.991]  And this is the most important in U.S.
[01:25:10.991 --> 01:25:11.951]  history.
[01:25:11.951 --> 01:25:13.892]  Our beachhead has to be secured.
[01:25:13.892 --> 01:25:15.153]  And they're making their moves.
[01:25:15.153 --> 01:25:16.674]  And this is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:25:16.674 --> 01:25:20.836]  But let's play a few of these clips with the whole re-education situation they're pushing.
[01:25:20.836 --> 01:25:22.937]  Our colleges are already re-education camps.
[01:25:22.937 --> 01:25:23.257]  Here it is.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.021]  So that's once they're in the camp.
[01:25:43.021 --> 01:25:44.602]  We're going to go to that in a moment.
[01:25:44.602 --> 01:25:48.505]  But for congruency, first in the movie, they go into a store, they talk to the girl.
[01:25:48.505 --> 01:25:50.206]  That's the clip we're going to play.
[01:25:50.206 --> 01:25:51.788]  She talks about where folks went.
[01:25:51.788 --> 01:25:53.909]  Well, we're already in a digital camp.
[01:25:53.909 --> 01:26:01.215]  They've already sent the conservatives, the Christians, the patriots, the pro-military, the pro-Constitution, the pro-Second Amendment people have already been shadow banned.
[01:26:01.215 --> 01:26:02.496]  Now we're being banned everywhere.
[01:26:02.496 --> 01:26:08.041]  And so that's how this works, as Matt Drudge warned two and a half years ago of DrudgeReport.com, God bless him.
[01:26:09.008 --> 01:26:19.253]  They was worn by high-level government officials and a Supreme Court Justice, the one conservative that's still around, and that this was all coming.
[01:26:19.253 --> 01:26:21.054]  And it's down here.
[01:26:21.054 --> 01:26:23.755]  So, here it is.
[01:26:23.755 --> 01:26:26.256]  Look, have you seen my father?
[01:26:26.256 --> 01:26:27.316]  I called, there was no answer.
[01:26:27.316 --> 01:26:28.517]  I went by the station, it was empty.
[01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:31.798]  Okay, listen.
[01:26:31.798 --> 01:26:35.100]  I'm gonna tell you something I'm not supposed to talk about.
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:36.120]  Nobody is.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.201]  But... But what?
[01:26:38.789 --> 01:26:40.670]  Look, they took a lot of people away.
[01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:42.790]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:46.011]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:26:46.011 --> 01:26:47.391]  Where?
[01:26:47.391 --> 01:26:50.472]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:26:50.472 --> 01:26:51.313]  The drive-in.
[01:26:51.313 --> 01:26:55.474]  I heard they took a lot of people to... Jed!
[01:26:55.474 --> 01:26:56.134]  I pray for you.
[01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:02.123]  We're gonna get to some more of that here in just a moment, but
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:30.004]  You hear it right there, America's a whorehouse, it's a piece of crap, it's all falling apart, blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:30.004 --> 01:27:32.006]  And then we killed Cuomo instead.
[01:27:32.006 --> 01:27:39.152]  And then now you're Cuomo, but instead of like, America's a whorehouse, it was never great, it's never gonna be great, they're like, yeah!
[01:27:39.152 --> 01:27:40.513]  It sucks!
[01:27:40.513 --> 01:27:41.214]  Yeah!
[01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:44.877]  Because, you know, he said, oh, I misspoke.
[01:27:44.877 --> 01:27:46.178]  But CNN defended him.
[01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.160]  But he didn't misspoke because you hear them.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.401]  This is their religion.
[01:27:50.418 --> 01:27:51.498]  They all feel like losers.
[01:27:51.498 --> 01:27:53.359]  They don't feel like they have a seat at the table.
[01:27:53.359 --> 01:27:54.679]  They want to run it all.
[01:27:54.679 --> 01:27:58.019]  And it's all funded by big banks that are tax-exempt.
[01:27:58.019 --> 01:27:59.580]  Play the clip.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.700]  We're not going to make America great again.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.461]  It was never that great.
[01:28:04.461 --> 01:28:11.642]  We have not reached greatness.
[01:28:11.642 --> 01:28:16.423]  We will reach greatness when every American
[01:28:17.253 --> 01:28:19.615]  Is fully engaged.
[01:28:19.615 --> 01:28:31.442]  We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51% of our population, is gone.
[01:28:31.442 --> 01:28:35.945]  That is a total psychological warfare op to turn women against community and break society.
[01:28:35.945 --> 01:28:43.590]  And notice he does the NPR thing where he talks about, welcome to Madonna, may I help you?
[01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:44.851]  Cuz they're in a trance.
[01:28:45.552 --> 01:28:48.077]  I am Governor Cuomo!
[01:28:48.077 --> 01:28:50.962]  You get places because of me!
[01:28:50.962 --> 01:28:53.668]  America never great!
[01:28:53.668 --> 01:28:56.192]  It never gonna be great ever again!

[01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:20.994]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:20.994 --> 01:33:21.755]  Or you're mine.
[01:33:31.574 --> 01:33:36.237]  America will never, was never great.
[01:33:36.237 --> 01:33:40.579]  And it will never be great either.
[01:33:40.579 --> 01:33:42.060]  Yay!
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.841]  We're not a cult of psycho scum.
[01:33:44.841 --> 01:33:45.822]  We're not weirdos.
[01:33:45.822 --> 01:33:47.482]  We're not dangerous.
[01:33:47.482 --> 01:33:49.263]  We love you, Cuomo.
[01:33:49.263 --> 01:33:56.627]  If you are a Christian, if you are a pro-rifle or pro-gun, get out of my state.
[01:33:56.627 --> 01:33:57.888]  Those are real quotes from two years ago.
[01:33:59.525 --> 01:34:03.087]  Bernie Sanders, what's up on Infowars.com?
[01:34:03.087 --> 01:34:05.029]  There's a new article out.
[01:34:05.029 --> 01:34:07.590]  America now believes in socialism.
[01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:09.632]  We are going to do it.
[01:34:09.632 --> 01:34:12.033]  It is going to be good.
[01:34:12.033 --> 01:34:14.715]  I never worked a day in my life.
[01:34:14.715 --> 01:34:16.796]  I did not have a job till I was 40 years old.
[01:34:18.636 --> 01:34:23.480]  I honeymooned in the Soviet Union where we could have our way with Christians.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:33.207]  You have to understand, when you're as ugly and stupid as I am, all you want to do is screw people over!
[01:34:33.207 --> 01:34:34.488]  And I will do it!
[01:34:34.488 --> 01:34:36.249]  Don't you worry about that!
[01:34:36.249 --> 01:34:40.753]  I mean, his sounds like they've had a bigger lobotomy.
[01:34:40.753 --> 01:34:43.435]  Cuomo?
[01:34:43.435 --> 01:34:44.075]  Or Sanders?
[01:34:44.075 --> 01:34:44.956]  I mean, let's play this one more time.
[01:34:46.346 --> 01:34:50.027]  America was never that great.
[01:34:50.027 --> 01:34:53.128]  It's more like, America never that great.
[01:34:53.128 --> 01:34:55.368]  And America never going to be great.
[01:34:55.368 --> 01:34:57.269]  Because we're mean to the women.
[01:34:57.269 --> 01:35:01.450]  We put them in burkas, we chop off their genitals, we sell them into sex slavery.
[01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:03.550]  They have the highest rate of college education.
[01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:05.491]  They live longer than anybody else.
[01:35:05.491 --> 01:35:09.832]  And we're being mean because women, you do what I tell you.
[01:35:09.832 --> 01:35:13.673]  Tell you alpha males are bad, unless it's me.
[01:35:15.746 --> 01:35:19.348]  Look at my baby brother!
[01:35:19.348 --> 01:35:22.049]  My baby brother on CNN!
[01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:34.635]  We are going to tell you when we take the money from the Gulf States, the dictators in China for CNN to put out propaganda.
[01:35:34.635 --> 01:35:41.779]  And then if Infowars tries to spread articles out of Germany of sex slave women that run into their ISIS captors in Germany,
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:47.564]  We are not going to allow it to be seen.
[01:35:47.564 --> 01:35:51.488]  Because we in charge now.
[01:35:51.488 --> 01:35:55.332]  We in charge of you now.
[01:35:55.332 --> 01:35:57.033]  Let's hear from him.
[01:35:57.033 --> 01:35:59.075]  I'm not dangerous.
[01:35:59.075 --> 01:36:01.598]  Never been great, not going to be great.
[01:36:01.598 --> 01:36:04.120]  Here it is.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.222]  We're not going to make America great again.
[01:36:06.222 --> 01:36:08.164]  It was never that great.
[01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:16.132]  We have not reached greatness.
[01:36:16.132 --> 01:36:23.664]  We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[01:36:23.664 --> 01:36:24.144]  Oh, that's good.
[01:36:24.144 --> 01:36:25.586]  So let me try to talk like him.
[01:36:25.586 --> 01:36:27.069]  I'll just read an article like him.
[01:36:29.158 --> 01:36:31.759]  This is how Hillary would do it.
[01:36:31.759 --> 01:36:36.100]  She'd go to Kentucky and she'd go, How you doing there, partner?
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:42.943]  I hates Rabbids as much as I hates Republicans.
[01:36:42.943 --> 01:36:47.844]  Daisy, Daisy.
[01:36:47.844 --> 01:36:51.646]  I am a HAL 9000 computer.
[01:36:51.646 --> 01:36:55.607]  Programmed in Chicago, Illinois in 2001.
[01:36:59.753 --> 01:37:00.514]  Let me read it like he does.
[01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:05.137]  I mean, how crazy are the Democrats trying to run a reanimated corpse like Hillary?
[01:37:05.137 --> 01:37:11.461]  I'm going to read the news like Governor Cuomo.
[01:37:11.461 --> 01:37:16.045]  Yazidi.
[01:37:16.045 --> 01:37:20.928]  Ex-slave.
[01:37:20.928 --> 01:37:25.852]  Trapped both in Iraq and in German exile.
[01:37:26.653 --> 01:37:33.076]  Runs into her sexual comfort.
[01:37:33.076 --> 01:37:46.502]  But you see, that is how we end up taking care of her, is putting her under Islamic control.
[01:37:46.502 --> 01:37:47.883]  Oh look, we had a bunch of stabbings.
[01:37:47.883 --> 01:37:49.904]  It's up on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:37:51.121 --> 01:38:00.426]  People being disemboweled during London stabbings for no reason, acid attacks, all the fun that's going on.
[01:38:00.426 --> 01:38:02.747]  But again, we shouldn't be talking about all that.
[01:38:02.747 --> 01:38:07.350]  Look at this.
[01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:15.554]  China police detain man for asking why can't Taiwan be called Taiwan.
[01:38:15.554 --> 01:38:17.055]  But don't worry, they're going to run your internet, so.
[01:38:19.338 --> 01:38:20.538]  Everything's okay.
[01:38:20.538 --> 01:38:25.020]  Let's go into just a small portion of the Islamic love we're facing today.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:29.542]  So you got the Yazidi sex slave meeting her captor.
[01:38:29.542 --> 01:38:32.182]  We're going to play that in a minute.
[01:38:32.182 --> 01:38:41.246]  Mother of two... Listen to this.
[01:38:41.246 --> 01:38:42.046]  Mother of two...
[01:38:43.362 --> 01:38:47.463]  Looked like an acid attack victim after ditching steroids.
[01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:53.585]  Hmm, that's an interesting story that they've mixed in the middle of my acid attack stack.
[01:38:53.585 --> 01:38:54.625]  There it is.
[01:38:54.625 --> 01:39:00.007]  Acid attack survivor sues ex-boyfriend for compensation in Germany.
[01:39:00.007 --> 01:39:03.568]  It's a nice little Islamic thing to do, but the media never says it.
[01:39:03.568 --> 01:39:11.250]  Turkey's economic collapse could send millions of migrants into Europe, analysts warn.
[01:39:12.861 --> 01:39:19.483]  And he's threatening, give me everything I want, let me have my own Islamic party to control Europe, or I'll flood you with Islamicists.
[01:39:19.483 --> 01:39:22.004]  But either way, they're going to do it.
[01:39:22.004 --> 01:39:26.825]  UK's criminal prosecutions at record low despite crime near all-time high.
[01:39:26.825 --> 01:39:31.227]  That's an article up on InfoWars.com on The Telegraph.
[01:39:32.503 --> 01:39:37.286]  Prosecutors have reached an all-time low, despite crime soaring in a new record.
[01:39:37.286 --> 01:39:54.097]  High official government figures reveal the number of people dealt with by criminal justice system in England and Wales fell 7% in the last year, while record crime shot up 11% to 5.5 million, mainly acid attacks and stabbings.
[01:39:54.097 --> 01:39:55.058]  Oh, I never even covered this.
[01:39:55.058 --> 01:39:56.579]  Will you guys print me again?
[01:39:56.579 --> 01:39:57.920]  The liberals from DC
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:39:59.560]  I think?
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:24.527]  Her and a few of the European right-wing liberals and a truckload, because they later posted it, of Islamists ran them over and then stabbed them to death.
[01:40:24.527 --> 01:40:32.353]  And there's actual video of it, as they begged for their lives saying, we love you, we love you, and they stabbed them to death.
[01:40:32.353 --> 01:40:32.994]  There it is.
[01:40:32.994 --> 01:40:37.357]  Millennial couple bikes through ISIS territory to prove humans are kind and get killed.
[01:40:39.232 --> 01:40:43.375]  So, I mean, these are well-meaning people, man, but they are in a cult.
[01:40:43.375 --> 01:40:46.057]  They think churches are bad.
[01:40:46.057 --> 01:40:47.238]  They think guns are bad.
[01:40:47.238 --> 01:40:49.119]  They think America's bad, on average.
[01:40:49.119 --> 01:40:50.500]  They're like Cuomo.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:55.043]  America would never great, never will be great.
[01:40:55.043 --> 01:41:02.048]  But Tadikaten is great until you ride your bike to Tadikaten and you know what happened.
[01:41:02.895 --> 01:41:17.626]  They run you over, and then as you beg for your life, they've already hit you, and two other cyclists, six men get out of the car, screaming death to non-believers, and stab you to death.
[01:41:17.626 --> 01:41:19.627]  And that's just like all the liberal websites.
[01:41:19.627 --> 01:41:21.549]  They're like, no, no, no, no.
[01:41:21.549 --> 01:41:22.730]  Islam is a religion of peace.
[01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:26.052]  It's a wondrous thing.
[01:41:26.052 --> 01:41:29.775]  Meanwhile, all the usual suspects have fled Europe.
[01:41:33.615 --> 01:41:37.156]  I mean, do you understand what the Middle East is like, or North Africa?
[01:41:37.156 --> 01:41:38.296]  It is bunker cuckoo land.
[01:41:38.296 --> 01:41:45.277]  You know, like in Star Trek, the Klingons have women as slaves, and they're like on chains, and it's like, that's terrible.
[01:41:45.277 --> 01:41:46.377]  That's what the mainline Muslims do.
[01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:03.990]  But you like it.
[01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:09.495]  It's kind of like all the, you know, Islamist food places and hookah bars are the coolest places for the girls.
[01:42:09.495 --> 01:42:18.362]  And the coolest thing is you can Islamist his boyfriend until they get on an airplane with him and fly to the Middle East and never leave sex slavery.
[01:42:18.362 --> 01:42:20.364]  Then turns out your so-called husband already married six women.
[01:42:20.364 --> 01:42:21.865]  They flew back for sex slavery.
[01:42:21.865 --> 01:42:23.006]  But it's so trendy.
[01:42:23.006 --> 01:42:25.408]  You're like, oh, my God, so trendy, so trendy.
[01:42:30.952 --> 01:42:33.093]  Failed politics scandals.
[01:42:33.093 --> 01:42:33.874]  Migrant violence.
[01:42:33.874 --> 01:42:35.735]  Sinked Macron.
[01:42:35.735 --> 01:42:49.624]  Authorities destroyed a New Mexico compound where Islamist-trained kids carried out school shootings and the dead body of a reportedly tortured-to-death little three-year-old was found, who died in a ritual to make him come out as the Christ.
[01:42:49.624 --> 01:42:54.067]  And the judge said, hey, just like the illegal alien shot the woman in the back, he gets to go free.
[01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.288]  They're like, hey, you want to torture a kid to death?
[01:42:58.143 --> 01:43:02.846]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:43:58.506 --> 01:43:59.947]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:43:59.947 --> 01:44:12.817]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:44:13.217 --> 01:44:24.245]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.

[01:44:55.379 --> 01:44:56.659]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:44:58.109 --> 01:45:02.252]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:45:02.252 --> 01:45:09.316]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[01:46:55.441 --> 01:47:14.309]  The poets tell how poncho fit.
[01:47:14.309 --> 01:47:20.711]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:20.711 --> 01:47:24.913]  I can always be down this little Merle Haggard.
[01:47:28.627 --> 01:47:56.864]  He left his livin' in cheap hotels The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold And so the story is we're thrown off Pancho needs your prayers, it's true He spent a few, but left it too He only did what he had to do And now he's grown old And now he's grown old
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:13.382]  All right, let's go ahead and get right to the news.
[01:48:13.382 --> 01:48:29.848]  I remember, like 22 years ago, having dinner with General Benton K. Parton, who was the former head of Air Force Development, and then later the head of the Air Force, and the head of HAARP, and the head of secret space programs, I mean, you name it.
[01:48:29.848 --> 01:48:30.889]  This guy knew everything.
[01:48:32.113 --> 01:48:36.354]  And I remember him saying, nothing matters but the communist program.
[01:48:36.354 --> 01:48:39.976]  And he goes, and it's funded by big banks, John Birch Society, it's all accurate.
[01:48:39.976 --> 01:48:44.177]  I've been there and I've seen it.
[01:48:44.177 --> 01:48:52.340]  And he said, the number one thing communists want is to get rid of the death penalty, because they know once there's a revolution, they can get their people out of prison.
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:49:00.203]  And the number one thing they want to do is if they can't do that, they will let leftists off for murders and their protected groups before the uprising.
[01:49:00.203 --> 01:49:00.963]  And it's a signal.
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:09.423]  And he talked about how they would go in, take over one country, suck it dry, exploit it, and domino against the next.
[01:49:09.423 --> 01:49:21.750]  There I was, like, you know, sitting at Luby's in Waco, just giving a speech at an event with him, and for two hours he's explaining it all.
[01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:24.151]  And again, that guy was traveling around the country to talk to groups of 100, 200, 300.
[01:49:24.151 --> 01:49:28.213]  Spending every dime he had doing it on his own dime.
[01:49:31.007 --> 01:49:34.289]  Fast forward to the shooter at Parkland.
[01:49:34.289 --> 01:49:40.212]  He'd been arrested for vandalism, for robbery, for threatening to kill people at least 15 times.
[01:49:40.212 --> 01:49:43.333]  The police had been out to his place 30 plus times.
[01:49:43.333 --> 01:49:45.834]  The FBI had been called more than 10 times.
[01:49:45.834 --> 01:49:55.339]  But there was part of a promise program, because he had the last name Cruz, he was a white kid, he was protected.
[01:49:55.339 --> 01:49:59.541]  Because Hispanics, Cuban Americans had adopted him, but both of them had died.
[01:50:02.125 --> 01:50:10.427]  So, this white crazy person gets a virtue signal.
[01:50:10.427 --> 01:50:12.007]  He was known as the school shooter.
[01:50:12.007 --> 01:50:16.068]  That's how he got his attention, going around threatening girls, going, bang, bang, you're dead.
[01:50:16.068 --> 01:50:18.288]  The police stood down that day, but look at this.
[01:50:18.288 --> 01:50:20.908]  Undocumented immigrant acquitted in case timely death.
[01:50:20.908 --> 01:50:27.450]  Admits he shot her in the back as she was out having at her lunch with her father.
[01:50:27.450 --> 01:50:28.830]  She died in her father's arms.
[01:50:32.128 --> 01:50:39.334]  But look at the Democrat in the photo of your TV viewer smiling with pleasure because it's a virtue signaling ritual.
[01:50:39.334 --> 01:50:57.529]  If they can let a guy go that admits he shot her in the back with no conviction, no parole, I mean, my God, folks, you'd get in more trouble if you got caught drinking and driving.
[01:50:57.529 --> 01:50:59.811]  He'd been deported four times, had all these other convictions.
[01:51:01.598 --> 01:51:09.200]  But they let him go, even though he squared up that revolver and right there in the back.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:17.202]  But see, they see that once you go out, but no, I see it all the time in Europe, and the UK, and here, and Australia.
[01:51:17.202 --> 01:51:23.483]  Look at this article, it's up on Infowars.com, it's got links, Paul Joseph Watson, the Associated Press.
[01:51:23.483 --> 01:51:30.565]  The son of the Imam, the unindicted co-conspirator, famous for the First World Trade Center bombing, his son,
[01:51:32.398 --> 01:51:38.421]  Reportedly runs off with a three-year-old a year ago that's a missing person kidnapped.
[01:51:38.421 --> 01:51:39.702]  Those reports are filed.
[01:51:39.702 --> 01:51:44.885]  The kids sometimes get calls out to family saying, get me out of here, it's hellish.
[01:51:44.885 --> 01:51:48.506]  Fourteen children, twelve of them trained to shoot people, reportedly.
[01:51:48.506 --> 01:51:54.550]  I know this has already been in the news, but now that they're going to be released, the judge has ordered it.
[01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:58.091]  No money paid, $20,000 bond, but she waived it.
[01:51:58.091 --> 01:51:59.252]  It's a signature bond.
[01:52:03.817 --> 01:52:11.980]  And the lawyers get up, Democrat lawyers, and they go, if they were white, or they were Christian, their children would not be taken, they would not be in jail.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:19.882]  You're out in a compound with tunnels in the middle of nowhere, and the kids tell people, calling, help us, we're starving to death, there's no water, they're training us to kill people?
[01:52:19.882 --> 01:52:25.884]  That's on record that the prosecutors are brought forward!
[01:52:25.884 --> 01:52:30.806]  I don't care if you're black, purple, polka-dotted, Christian, Muslim, whatever, your ass is under the jail!
[01:52:32.039 --> 01:52:45.450]  There's a three-year-old dead in their statements in a ritual where they had to, I guess, the way this weird-ass stuff works, was torture him to make Jesus come out.
[01:52:45.450 --> 01:52:47.992]  That's what's being reported.
[01:52:47.992 --> 01:52:49.533]  I don't care how the three-year-old died.
[01:52:49.533 --> 01:52:55.858]  You got a dead three-year-old on your property that's missing from another state, been dead for over a year,
[01:52:59.611 --> 01:53:13.974]  And just like no neighbors called on the San Bernardino husband and wife that went to the Christmas party to kill Christians and Jews and killed a bunch of people, their neighbors said, well they were making bombs and they were saying they were going to kill everybody, but you know, we didn't want to be politically incorrect.
[01:53:13.974 --> 01:53:25.656]  And the feds that investigated them two years before were under judicial review and almost indicted for religious persecution because they had them under investigation for going to Pakistan and going to Saudi Arabia at terrorist training camps.
[01:53:29.258 --> 01:53:30.580]  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:36.667]  So, authorities destroy New Mexico compound where Islamists have trained kids to carry out school shootings, reportedly.
[01:53:36.667 --> 01:53:37.668]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:53:37.668 --> 01:53:40.711]  It says right here, from the Associated Press,
[01:53:42.890 --> 01:54:02.857]  On Thursday, authorities found the decomposing body of the three-year-old Abdul Gawan Wahan, who was killed in a religious ritual by his father, Sir John Wahajan, the son of the famous New York Imam, who was also identified as a coven spirit or the 93 World Trade Center bombing.
[01:54:02.857 --> 01:54:07.179]  The suspects hoped the boy would be resurrected as Jesus,
[01:54:10.069 --> 01:54:14.051]  And help the group target corrupt institutions and people.
[01:54:14.051 --> 01:54:19.193]  Now I looked up this weird, super strange angle of Islam that like ties into voodoo and stuff.
[01:54:19.193 --> 01:54:21.473]  And we, this is what the best investigators believe.
[01:54:21.473 --> 01:54:26.375]  He was tortured to death, cat-or-nine-tailed, crucified.
[01:54:26.375 --> 01:54:28.496]  The body was almost unidentifiable.
[01:54:28.496 --> 01:54:31.577]  That's what this ritual is.
[01:54:31.577 --> 01:54:33.618]  I looked it up.
[01:54:33.618 --> 01:54:37.460]  This three-year-old was tortured like Christ, reportedly.
[01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:38.400]  Cat-or-nine-tailed.
[01:54:39.778 --> 01:54:42.481]  Crucify!
[01:54:42.481 --> 01:54:49.027]  Bound in an underground tomb to rise as Christ!
[01:54:49.027 --> 01:54:53.811]  And these people are being released!
[01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:55.593]  America was never great!
[01:54:55.593 --> 01:54:57.054]  It never will be great!
[01:54:57.054 --> 01:54:59.637]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do!
[01:54:59.637 --> 01:55:01.739]  Oh, and I took the revolver and shot her in the back!
[01:55:01.739 --> 01:55:02.499]  Go free!
[01:55:02.499 --> 01:55:04.021]  Hell!
[01:55:04.021 --> 01:55:04.501]  She's white!
[01:55:04.501 --> 01:55:05.002]  It's okay!
[01:55:10.799 --> 01:55:11.840]  He died in a ritual.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:12.720]  They thought he'd rise again.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:14.241]  Well, that's okay.
[01:55:14.241 --> 01:55:18.984]  They should obviously be in a lunatic asylum.
[01:55:18.984 --> 01:55:24.246]  But one thing Reagan did wrong was they did defund the state hospitals in the early 80s.
[01:55:24.246 --> 01:55:26.088]  And God Almighty, help us.
[01:55:26.088 --> 01:55:31.491]  I mean, whack jobs, people.
[01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:33.592]  Total, complete whack jobs.
[01:55:37.046 --> 01:55:38.928]  They only found the baby yesterday.
[01:55:38.928 --> 01:55:43.193]  Remember the early reports where there's a dead body, the child died in the affidavits, the cops filed.
[01:55:43.193 --> 01:55:45.115]  The state police and the local police.
[01:55:45.115 --> 01:55:49.480]  They're like, don't release him, the kids all told us, and they found the dead baby!
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:55.807]  They found the dead three-year-old, just like the kids told them, and they're still going free!
[01:56:03.328 --> 01:56:07.254]  Because they're signaling to their people, do whatever you want, go crazy, we're going to let you out.
[01:56:07.254 --> 01:56:09.759]  Just like Benton Parton said.
[01:56:09.759 --> 01:56:12.082]  He said the left wants to release all the criminals to go wild.
[01:56:12.082 --> 01:56:12.864]  I'm like rolling my eyes.
[01:56:12.864 --> 01:56:14.887]  I'm like, we got too many prisons, General.
[01:56:14.887 --> 01:56:16.409]  He's like, yeah, that doesn't matter.
[01:56:16.409 --> 01:56:17.671]  I'm talking about leftist operatives.
[01:56:20.049 --> 01:56:23.411]  He goes, they built all the prisons to train the people, Jones.
[01:56:23.411 --> 01:56:27.053]  And I was like, obviously he was smart, I was young.
[01:56:27.053 --> 01:56:27.993]  I haven't plugged the salary.
[01:56:27.993 --> 01:56:30.075]  If you don't fund us, we'll be shut down.
[01:56:30.075 --> 01:56:30.975]  It's that simple.
[01:56:30.975 --> 01:56:32.276]  We have a bunch of incredible products.
[01:56:32.276 --> 01:56:39.580]  The best fish oil, the best fish oil for your kids, On A Roll, the best krill oil, the best X2, Brain Force, fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:47.704]  If everyone just goes and signs up for the toothpaste, signs up for auto-ship, additional 10% off, they'll come to you each month, you'll fund the operation, we'll defeat the globalists.
[01:56:47.704 --> 01:56:48.265]  If not, well,
[01:56:49.185 --> 01:56:53.268]  Unfortunately, nine times out of ten, it is us that crashed through the enemy brigades.
[01:56:53.268 --> 01:56:54.129]  I wish it wasn't us.
[01:56:54.129 --> 01:56:56.810]  I wish we had a bunch of people beside us and we were winning on every front.
[01:56:56.810 --> 01:56:59.212]  But we're winning because of him full wars in your support.
[01:56:59.212 --> 01:57:00.273]  And I'm not being arrogant about it.
[01:57:00.273 --> 01:57:03.195]  I'm actually, I really want to be made obsolete, man.
[01:57:03.195 --> 01:57:04.576]  I really, really, really do.
[01:57:04.576 --> 01:57:05.837]  I want to be the tip of the spear.
[01:57:05.837 --> 01:57:06.937]  I don't want to march point anymore.
[01:57:06.937 --> 01:57:08.659]  I love my kids, my family, but I'm going to do it.
[01:57:08.659 --> 01:57:10.340]  But I need money.
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:12.101]  I need big fat dollar signs.
[01:57:12.101 --> 01:57:14.363]  Hey, can you see how we're the number one enemy after Trump?
[01:57:15.481 --> 01:57:16.762]  And I don't have nine million dollars.
[01:57:16.762 --> 01:57:20.965]  He's already spent reportedly a billion and a half dollars of his own money in the lawsuits and the filings and everything.
[01:57:20.965 --> 01:57:22.686]  He's already lost a billion and a half dollars.
[01:57:22.686 --> 01:57:23.206]  God bless him.
[01:57:23.206 --> 01:57:24.187]  I'm ready to lose everything I got.
[01:57:24.187 --> 01:57:25.748]  I don't give a damn about money.
[01:57:25.748 --> 01:57:27.329]  I use it as the fuel to be independent.
[01:57:27.329 --> 01:57:28.770]  I need money bad.
[01:57:28.770 --> 01:57:30.311]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:58:48.444 --> 01:58:54.831]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:58:54.831 --> 01:58:58.054]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:58:58.054 --> 01:59:01.758]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:59:01.758 --> 01:59:06.463]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:06.463 --> 01:59:09.726]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.607 --> 01:59:21.610]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.610 --> 01:59:30.133]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[01:59:31.773 --> 01:59:33.615]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:56.107 --> 02:00:00.788]  So when your wife says, Alex, please pass the potatoes, what does Elon Musk say?
[02:00:00.788 --> 02:00:06.690]  He says, I've been at the big corporate boardrooms where they say humanity will be obsolete by 2015.
[02:00:06.690 --> 02:00:10.191]  This is the consensus at Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[02:00:10.191 --> 02:00:12.612]  I mean, this is what this is the plan.
[02:00:12.612 --> 02:00:15.493]  And we're going to merge the machines, become gods.
[02:00:15.493 --> 02:00:18.934]  But first, we've got to reduce the world population 90 percent.
[02:00:19.554 --> 02:00:26.816]  Well, they're the ones actually hurting the environment in most cases, doing all the, you know, cross-human animals and stuff, and just all these abominations.
[02:00:26.816 --> 02:00:31.377]  And the meteorites aren't even saying, Jones is insane, there's no human-animal hybrids.
[02:00:31.377 --> 02:00:34.118]  Since frickin' MIT 20 years ago wrote about it.
[02:00:34.118 --> 02:00:35.818]  It's just they don't roll that stuff around.
[02:00:35.818 --> 02:00:43.400]  It's like they don't show you the primate center in Bastrop, one of the biggest in the world, where they've got every monkey and ape that you've got strapped in,
[02:00:43.905 --> 02:00:50.368]  Big computer screens, testing drugs on them, testing flicker rates on the screens.
[02:00:50.368 --> 02:00:56.992]  Then we have to give our kids filtered water, and the news says, what a cook, there's nothing in the water.
[02:00:56.992 --> 02:01:02.995]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:01:02.995 --> 02:01:08.878]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[02:01:08.878 --> 02:01:12.240]  Something you call love, but confess.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:12.980]  Not that, Hillary.
[02:01:14.495 --> 02:01:16.117]  Pretty pathetic.
[02:01:16.117 --> 02:01:19.960]  They have all these CNN folks openly
[02:01:39.150 --> 02:01:41.031]  Attacking every one of our sponsors for years.
[02:01:41.031 --> 02:01:43.952]  Attacking publishers that are going to put books out.
[02:01:43.952 --> 02:01:47.394]  Torturously interfering with everything I do.
[02:01:47.394 --> 02:01:49.996]  Trying to shut everything down.
[02:01:49.996 --> 02:01:51.696]  And then, they just keep lying.
[02:01:51.696 --> 02:01:54.898]  Now crank it up.
[02:01:54.898 --> 02:02:02.702]  That's right.
[02:02:02.702 --> 02:02:05.803]  I like the part about, I just found a brand new box of matches.
[02:02:11.359 --> 02:02:16.123]  And that's just what they'll do.
[02:02:16.123 --> 02:02:17.944]  One of these days.
[02:02:17.944 --> 02:02:23.028]  And they think they're going to win.
[02:02:23.028 --> 02:02:23.508]  No, they're not.
[02:02:23.508 --> 02:02:26.250]  Now, Sabelle Evans is going to join us in the next segment.
[02:02:26.250 --> 02:02:31.514]  Former FBI, CIA translator, helped break all the big news about 9-11, you name it.
[02:02:31.514 --> 02:02:32.675]  She's coming on.
[02:02:32.675 --> 02:02:33.596]  She's formerly from Turkey.
[02:02:34.895 --> 02:02:41.496]  To break down the globalist trying to sabotage relations with Turkey to have a big international disaster for Trump.
[02:02:41.496 --> 02:02:44.397]  They've been trying to sabotage the peace deal with North Korea.
[02:02:44.397 --> 02:02:47.258]  You name it, she's with Newsbud.
[02:02:47.258 --> 02:02:51.539]  That's going to be coming up in the next segment with Herb.
[02:02:51.539 --> 02:02:55.219]  And so much more that we're going to be getting into.
[02:02:55.219 --> 02:02:58.080]  Some of the other news I haven't gotten into will also get in with her.
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:02.561]  The way the media acts like John Brennan's having his free speech taken.
[02:03:04.161 --> 02:03:06.923]  John Brennan deserves his national security clearance.
[02:03:06.923 --> 02:03:08.545]  He says kill the president.
[02:03:08.545 --> 02:03:10.006]  He's a traitor.
[02:03:10.006 --> 02:03:16.611]  He's using his national security clearance to talk to people in government to then get classified info and then spin it.
[02:03:16.611 --> 02:03:21.855]  John Brennan lied to Congress and said that not one civilian was killed in drone strikes by Obama.
[02:03:21.855 --> 02:03:32.384]  His other clapper, his other supporter, former head of the Office of National Security, or the group that manages all the security agencies, the Office of
[02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:34.260]  What's the name of that?
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:35.921]  I can't keep track of all the 17 agencies.
[02:03:35.921 --> 02:03:45.424]  The top agency, the Office of National Intelligence, he famously told Congress that no one's ever been spot on the U.S.
[02:03:45.424 --> 02:03:46.204]  by the NSA.
[02:03:46.204 --> 02:03:48.584]  I mean these people are a joke.
[02:03:48.584 --> 02:03:50.085]  So they're saying to us that
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:55.741]  They're doing all of this and it's just completely insane.
[02:03:55.741 --> 02:04:00.104]  They're saying that Trump is bad because he pulled his national security clearance.
[02:04:00.104 --> 02:04:04.025]  It's all just symbolic anyways to say this guy is not an American.
[02:04:04.025 --> 02:04:14.491]  This guy is a mentally ill monster who was brought into this because he's all part of subverting and parasiting and taking the country over for corrupt aims.
[02:04:14.491 --> 02:04:20.874]  I mean, John Brennan is a famously corrupt person that joined the Communist Party, voted for it when he was an adult.
[02:04:20.874 --> 02:04:22.415]  He's just a saboteur.
[02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:26.132]  And in my view, he's a very, very monstrous individual.
[02:04:26.132 --> 02:04:31.216]  Plus, you watch video of the way he walks around down the hallways, like everybody's scared of him.
[02:04:31.216 --> 02:04:32.677]  He's like, I'm John Brennan.
[02:04:32.677 --> 02:04:34.218]  I'll screw America over.
[02:04:34.218 --> 02:04:36.019]  Obama loves me.
[02:04:36.019 --> 02:04:37.060]  So's Rahm Emanuel.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:39.282]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[02:04:39.282 --> 02:04:40.302]  Soros likes me.
[02:04:40.302 --> 02:04:41.363]  I'm John Brennan.
[02:04:41.363 --> 02:04:43.184]  He's scared of me.
[02:04:43.184 --> 02:04:44.425]  Well, some people aren't scared of you.
[02:04:44.425 --> 02:04:49.389]  Some people aren't scared of you, Brennan.
[02:04:49.389 --> 02:04:50.129]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:50.129 --> 02:04:50.550]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.308 --> 02:04:57.649]  We knew it was coming.
[02:04:57.649 --> 02:04:59.091]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[02:04:59.091 --> 02:05:11.964]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[02:05:12.344 --> 02:05:23.392]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[02:05:23.392 --> 02:05:32.258]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:42.403]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[02:05:42.403 --> 02:05:54.530]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:55.811]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:05.330]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:08.091]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:06:08.091 --> 02:06:10.993]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.993 --> 02:06:14.055]  My love isn't leaving the freeway.
[02:06:14.055 --> 02:06:19.218]  It's a fashion war ride, as the cities fly by.
[02:06:19.218 --> 02:06:25.261]  The daylight is dark, in the coming of night.
[02:06:25.261 --> 02:06:28.063]  And the questions in my mind.
[02:06:34.517 --> 02:06:37.479]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:06:37.479 --> 02:06:39.840]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:41.241]  I believe in you!
[02:06:41.241 --> 02:06:45.123]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:06:45.123 --> 02:06:47.444]  One man ever raped a woman!
[02:06:47.444 --> 02:06:49.326]  All genitals were cut off!
[02:06:49.326 --> 02:06:51.867]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:06:51.867 --> 02:06:54.529]  And we're not backing down on her!
[02:06:54.529 --> 02:06:56.190]  I want to kick these people!
[02:06:56.190 --> 02:06:56.750]  We're winning!
[02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:58.011]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:06:58.011 --> 02:06:58.751]  Can't you?
[02:06:58.751 --> 02:07:00.772]  We have broken their back!
[02:07:00.772 --> 02:07:01.873]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:07:05.834 --> 02:07:06.134]  Let's go!
[02:07:06.134 --> 02:07:06.674]  Come on!
[02:07:06.674 --> 02:07:07.895]  Come on!

[02:07:18.739 --> 02:07:19.079]  Come on!
[02:07:19.079 --> 02:07:19.480]  Come on!
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:19.800]  Come on!
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:20.060]  Come on!

[02:07:24.261 --> 02:07:24.542]  Come on!
[02:07:24.542 --> 02:07:25.262]  Come on!
[02:07:25.262 --> 02:07:25.662]  Come on!
[02:07:25.662 --> 02:07:26.022]  Come on!
[02:07:26.022 --> 02:07:26.322]  Come on!
[02:07:26.322 --> 02:07:26.902]  Come on!
[02:07:26.902 --> 02:07:27.363]  Come on!
[02:07:27.363 --> 02:07:27.603]  Come on!
[02:07:27.603 --> 02:07:28.083]  Come on!
[02:07:28.083 --> 02:07:28.303]  Come on!
[02:07:28.303 --> 02:07:28.643]  Come on!
[02:07:28.643 --> 02:07:29.043]  Come on!
[02:07:29.043 --> 02:07:29.363]  Come on!
[02:07:29.363 --> 02:07:29.624]  Come on!
[02:07:29.624 --> 02:07:29.924]  Come on!
[02:07:29.924 --> 02:07:30.224]  Come on!
[02:07:30.224 --> 02:07:30.464]  Come on!
[02:07:30.464 --> 02:07:30.684]  Come on!
[02:07:30.684 --> 02:07:33.205]  Come on!
[02:07:33.205 --> 02:07:33.585]  Come on!
[02:07:33.585 --> 02:07:33.885]  Come on!
[02:07:33.885 --> 02:07:34.245]  Come on!
[02:07:34.245 --> 02:07:35.506]  Come on!
[02:07:35.506 --> 02:07:35.586]  Come
[02:07:39.858 --> 02:07:47.945]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[02:08:03.547 --> 02:08:08.572]  Sybil Edmonds of Newsbud.com joins us, and I totally agree with her analysis.
[02:08:08.572 --> 02:08:12.316]  The globalists, the deep state, is trying to sabotage U.S.-Turkey relations.
[02:08:12.316 --> 02:08:14.819]  Things are hurtling out of control very, very quickly.
[02:08:14.819 --> 02:08:17.181]  General Flynn wanted to have good relations with Turkey.
[02:08:17.181 --> 02:08:18.102]  That's so strategic.
[02:08:18.963 --> 02:08:24.066]  Now, Erdogan is threatening to flood Europe with more Islamists if their economy implodes.
[02:08:24.066 --> 02:08:26.527]  Here's the Express.co.uk.
[02:08:26.527 --> 02:08:33.431]  World War III, Turkey's Erdogan calls for Army of Islam, close quote, to attack Israel on all sides.
[02:08:33.431 --> 02:08:37.634]  So, things are spinning out of control right now.
[02:08:37.634 --> 02:08:40.756]  And Sabel Evans was a famous FBI translator.
[02:08:41.676 --> 02:08:46.780]  One of the key people that helped expose what was happening with 9-11, testified secretly to Congress.
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:55.686]  I'm going to go over all of her background, newsbud.com, and she's also the editor of Boiling Frogs Post and founder and director of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition.
[02:08:55.686 --> 02:08:58.708]  She won a lot of national awards for her courage, and she joins us to get into this.
[02:08:58.708 --> 02:09:01.110]  She's also originally from Turkey, so she's an expert on it.
[02:09:01.670 --> 02:09:09.736]  Geopolitically, for people that don't know, first, break down how important Turkey is, your background on this, and from your expert analysis, where we currently are.
[02:09:09.736 --> 02:09:11.477]  Because this is a big, big deal.
[02:09:11.477 --> 02:09:17.862]  Obviously, one of the biggest militaries in not just the Middle East, but Europe, is Turkey, former seat of the Ottoman Empire.
[02:09:17.862 --> 02:09:18.762]  A lot of U.S.
[02:09:18.762 --> 02:09:22.765]  military bases, nuclear weapons there, a key component with Russia.
[02:09:22.765 --> 02:09:24.927]  And so, what do you think is really happening, Sabel Edmonds?
[02:09:26.528 --> 02:09:32.554]  Hi Alex and thank you for giving me this opportunity as always again.
[02:09:32.554 --> 02:09:34.876]  And before I start, let me congratulate you.
[02:09:34.876 --> 02:09:45.326]  I think you have proved your resilience and what has been happening with you, we have been all expecting this because it's going to be happening to all of us.
[02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:58.584]  Just a major proof that what you have been accomplishing and how much of a threat you have become to the establishment, to the state.
[02:09:58.584 --> 02:10:01.367]  So wear it as a badge of honor.
[02:10:01.367 --> 02:10:01.948]  Thank you.
[02:10:01.948 --> 02:10:03.630]  Because you're not down.
[02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:05.352]  You are still marching forward.
[02:10:07.735 --> 02:10:22.913]  Just to let you know, after I was with you in your studio and we had a great segment on this terrorist block in Austin, Texas, I just want to give a little flavor to your listeners.
[02:10:25.606 --> 02:10:48.332]  You have no idea how much of sabotage came towards NewsBud, calling me, because I went on your show, a sexist, a skinhead, a Nazi, a racist, and people started approaching our team members, trying to get some of them to walk away, trying to get some people to screw up.
[02:10:49.373 --> 02:10:52.776]  And just saying that, that was it!
[02:10:52.776 --> 02:11:00.723]  Because I went to an Alex Jones Show, I was going to suffer the consequences, and NewsBud was given two months to calm down.
[02:11:00.723 --> 02:11:01.304]  Guess what?
[02:11:01.304 --> 02:11:03.165]  We are still standing as well.
[02:11:03.165 --> 02:11:11.533]  We let go of several people, and I remember reading on the headlines some of your former employees who were just
[02:11:12.113 --> 02:11:20.455]  The same way they were being used to come out and start putting out some false allegations and starting lawsuits.
[02:11:20.455 --> 02:11:34.159]  So what I'm trying to say here is, this is the modus operandi for the people, but the good news is, and here's the really good news, because people should focus on good news, the positive side.
[02:11:34.159 --> 02:11:38.940]  I'm still standing, you're still standing, you are still standing, and
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:50.812]  Believe me or not, you have millions of people in Turkey, in Turkey, because I have been in touch with people, I have been covering all the breaking news, the recent escalations, etc.
[02:11:50.812 --> 02:11:56.258]  on Turkey for the past two years, and you have millions of followers in Turkey.
[02:11:56.258 --> 02:11:59.142]  Well, I am, I am, and Jebel, stay right there, but I want to talk about this.
[02:12:00.225 --> 02:12:01.827]  I had Mike Adams in the studio yesterday.
[02:12:01.827 --> 02:12:10.496]  I have been called six times last week by people saying that the New York Times calls up and says, give us dirt.
[02:12:10.496 --> 02:12:14.179]  When they won't, they go, we're going to attack you, that we're going to write stories about you.
[02:12:14.179 --> 02:12:16.962]  They only do that before they like invade Iraq and stuff.
[02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:20.966]  They're sending in like their most corrupt, their worst reporters, their most dirty people
[02:12:21.647 --> 02:12:25.850]  To literally throw up a dragnet to find something and they're getting really desperate.
[02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:27.330]  And now that's what CNN does.
[02:12:27.330 --> 02:12:28.851]  They threaten our sponsors.
[02:12:28.851 --> 02:12:31.393]  They get us taken off the internet.
[02:12:31.393 --> 02:12:35.055]  The New York Times, we have Veritas Video where they go try to get us thrown off the internet.
[02:12:35.055 --> 02:12:36.616]  These aren't even media outlets anymore.
[02:12:36.616 --> 02:12:38.857]  These are like gangster groups.
[02:12:38.857 --> 02:12:40.598]  People understand they're not just fake news.
[02:12:40.598 --> 02:12:43.380]  These are, in my view, criminal organizations.
[02:12:44.062 --> 02:12:45.203]  Mafia style.
[02:12:45.203 --> 02:12:47.924]  They do use mafia tactics.
[02:12:47.924 --> 02:12:49.164]  They play very dirty.
[02:12:49.164 --> 02:12:53.126]  I just announced on Twitter, I said, well, I'm daring you.
[02:12:53.126 --> 02:12:55.287]  And I put Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
[02:12:55.287 --> 02:12:57.608]  We have over 60,000 followers on YouTube.
[02:12:57.608 --> 02:13:00.050]  I have about 50,000 followers on Twitter.
[02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:02.091]  I said, I'm going on Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:02.091 --> 02:13:03.471]  I'm daring you.
[02:13:03.471 --> 02:13:06.793]  And I know the consequence may be that you're going to pull the plug.
[02:13:07.446 --> 02:13:14.288]  Do it now, because two and a half years ago when we went through the Kickstarter and fundraising, we told people this was going to happen.
[02:13:14.288 --> 02:13:18.349]  This was going to happen, that's why we have to be independent.
[02:13:18.349 --> 02:13:20.370]  We have to have our own servers.
[02:13:20.370 --> 02:13:23.931]  That these channels... That's what Matt Drudge came here two and a half years ago and he said, Alex...
[02:13:24.983 --> 02:13:27.584]  I've met with high-level Republicans and Supreme Court.
[02:13:27.584 --> 02:13:29.244]  If Hillary gets elected, they're going to take the free speech.
[02:13:29.244 --> 02:13:31.505]  But even if she doesn't, they're going to take the free speech.
[02:13:31.505 --> 02:13:37.066]  And so, we're now hearing, even though Trump still won... President Trump, now we have Trump as president.
[02:13:37.066 --> 02:13:43.548]  But look, the Hollywood, mainstream media, the publishing houses, majority of the academic circles,
[02:13:43.968 --> 02:13:50.492]  The public schools, they are still under the control of the lefty state.
[02:13:50.492 --> 02:13:58.298]  So just having the presidency changed, having a different administration, do not remove any of those.
[02:13:58.298 --> 02:13:59.058]  Forget about it.
[02:13:59.058 --> 02:14:01.120]  We're going to be talking about Turkey.
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:06.643]  And what I believe, you have the link, I know you're going to be providing it to your viewers and listeners.
[02:14:06.643 --> 02:14:10.306]  Six months ago, I broke the news at NewsBud.
[02:14:10.306 --> 02:14:12.107]  I said there are certain elements
[02:14:12.651 --> 02:14:23.599]  Within the State Department, within the CIA, who are sabotaging Trump and Pence's work, diplomatic channels, with Turkey.
[02:14:23.599 --> 02:14:30.745]  Because, look, the attempted coup that happened in Turkey, on whose watch did it happen?
[02:14:30.745 --> 02:14:36.789]  The CIA's Operation Glad You'll Be Through This Moonlock Terrorist Best of Luck U-Land.
[02:14:36.789 --> 02:14:40.292]  It happened during the Obama, Obama's watch.
[02:14:40.991 --> 02:14:45.714]  It happened during the Clinton-Obama dual watch.
[02:14:45.714 --> 02:14:55.040]  So during the entire primaries, the Turkish people, the Turkish government, they lined up their support for Trump.
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:59.722]  It was like, Clinton getting elected is going to be the biggest nightmare for Turkey.
[02:14:59.722 --> 02:15:01.604]  We are sick and tired of this.
[02:15:01.604 --> 02:15:03.505]  They attacked our sovereignty.
[02:15:04.105 --> 02:15:09.890]  So everyone, almost everyone in Turkey supported Trump's presidency.
[02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:14.653]  And Trump liked Erdogan because they have some common traits.
[02:15:14.653 --> 02:15:15.714]  Sure, at first that happened.
[02:15:15.714 --> 02:15:16.915]  So how did it all get derailed?
[02:15:16.915 --> 02:15:19.117]  Let's talk about that with Sabel Edmonds.
[02:15:19.117 --> 02:15:20.298]  Your phone's breaking up a bit.
[02:15:20.298 --> 02:15:21.719]  We'll see if we can get you on Skype.
[02:15:21.719 --> 02:15:24.841]  Straight ahead on the other side because this is critical information.
[02:15:24.841 --> 02:15:26.943]  Geopolitically, it's a key piece between the Middle East.
[02:15:27.623 --> 02:15:30.224]  And Europe, and what's really going on there.
[02:15:30.224 --> 02:15:33.864]  I really respect Sabelle Edmonds and her work she's doing at Newsbud.com.

[02:17:25.265 --> 02:17:26.486]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:26.486 --> 02:17:30.408]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:31.948]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:31.948 --> 02:17:34.910]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:40.472]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:40.472 --> 02:17:41.673]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:41.673 --> 02:17:44.614]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:44.614 --> 02:17:46.835]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:46.835 --> 02:17:51.277]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:17:51.277 --> 02:17:53.599]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[02:18:03.956 --> 02:18:04.437]  It's you!
[02:18:05.546 --> 02:18:08.048]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:18:08.048 --> 02:18:09.369]  You are the info war.
[02:18:09.369 --> 02:18:12.331]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:18:26.701 --> 02:18:38.090]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:18:38.090 --> 02:18:46.056]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:18:46.056 --> 02:18:52.641]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:18:53.081 --> 02:18:54.602]  We are the Renaissance.
[02:18:54.602 --> 02:18:56.102]  And we are winning.
[02:18:56.102 --> 02:19:06.705]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.705 --> 02:19:08.546]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:19:08.766 --> 02:19:11.647]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:19:11.647 --> 02:19:13.128]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.128 --> 02:19:19.952]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.952 --> 02:19:22.033]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:22.033 --> 02:19:31.737]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.737 --> 02:19:36.740]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:48.543]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.543 --> 02:19:51.844]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.844 --> 02:19:59.445]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:59.445 --> 02:20:02.046]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:33.576 --> 02:20:35.637]  Well, six months ago we broke the news, Alex, because as I said,
[02:20:55.822 --> 02:21:02.849]  The entire population in Turkey, they were cheering for President Trump for his presidency during his candidacy.
[02:21:02.849 --> 02:21:08.895]  And as I was saying, there are several traits that both presidents have in common.
[02:21:08.895 --> 02:21:11.278]  In Turkey, we had a similar situation.
[02:21:11.278 --> 02:21:16.984]  You know, we had that very small, minute, left-leaning neoliberal elite.
[02:21:17.464 --> 02:21:17.965]  I don't know.
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:36.442]  But the neoliberal Europe, they can't stand it.
[02:21:36.442 --> 02:21:52.531]  Well, knowing that, and some of the commentaries, because they are both blunt, both President Trump and President Erdogan, and they both have the more traditionalist approach, more conservative approach, both physically, but also philosophically.
[02:21:52.951 --> 02:22:08.370]  So there was this great relationship between Trump and Erdogan, especially after the attempted coup that was concocted by the Clinton-Obama duo Operation Glad You'll Be through this Mullah terrorist, Fethullah Gulen.
[02:22:08.370 --> 02:22:09.251]  Everything was good.
[02:22:10.311 --> 02:22:20.693]  What happened was, about a year and a half ago, Turkey arrested this undercover CIA operative who has been posing as a pastor.
[02:22:20.693 --> 02:22:20.974]  Okay?
[02:22:20.974 --> 02:22:22.754]  His name is Bronson.
[02:22:22.754 --> 02:22:25.395]  Pastor Andrew Bronson.
[02:22:25.395 --> 02:22:27.175]  And they have these evidence.
[02:22:27.175 --> 02:22:29.115]  Some of the evidence has been published.
[02:22:29.115 --> 02:22:31.236]  Some of those has not been published.
[02:22:31.916 --> 02:22:37.680]  But there are ties and connections between this pastor and Graham Fuller.
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:40.903]  Graham Fuller was Clinton's top pick.
[02:22:40.903 --> 02:22:42.944]  Clinton's top pick for the middle class.
[02:22:46.923 --> 02:22:47.563]  We're good to go.
[02:23:07.483 --> 02:23:20.754]  Behind the scenes, they have been talking through diplomatic channels but also having direct talks with the Turkish government officials trying to get this guy released and sent back to the United States, right?
[02:23:20.754 --> 02:23:25.818]  Well, while President Trump was making great progress and was
[02:23:26.358 --> 02:23:39.643]  During the time Turkey was actually so close to release and send this guy back to the United States, these elements in the State Department and the CIA, these are the Clinton leftover cabals.
[02:23:39.643 --> 02:23:54.568]  A lot of people, they know about Mueller and Comey and the fact that FBI, DOJ is infested by the Clintonite cabal, but most people don't know about the cabals left over in the State Department and the CIA.
[02:23:55.669 --> 02:24:06.820]  So, trying to sabotage Trump's progress with Turkey and getting so happy because Trump and Turkey started rebuilding the relationship.
[02:24:06.820 --> 02:24:16.691]  This group, they co-opted this pastor's wife, her name is Noreen Bronson, and they brought her before these EU human rights courts.
[02:24:17.271 --> 02:24:31.100]  And told her to lie and say her husband was being tortured, Erdogan was dictator, and she was doing this while Trump and Pence were making progress, having this pastor released.
[02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:38.205]  Well, of course, Turkey, based on its own sovereignty and nationalism, they were like, hold on a second.
[02:24:38.205 --> 02:24:39.146]  Hold on a second.
[02:24:39.838 --> 02:24:43.041]  On one hand, you, your White House is doing this.
[02:24:43.041 --> 02:24:49.707]  On the other hand, your CIA and the State Department and this pastor's wife, they are doing this.
[02:24:49.707 --> 02:24:54.872]  And we're not going to come out and look weak and release as a goodwill gesture.
[02:24:54.872 --> 02:24:56.954]  So all deals are off.
[02:24:56.954 --> 02:24:59.797]  Well, we broke the story six months ago.
[02:25:00.612 --> 02:25:02.613]  We warned President Trump.
[02:25:02.613 --> 02:25:11.957]  We said there are elements within the State Department and the CIA, and they are sabotaging the progress you're making with Turkey.
[02:25:11.957 --> 02:25:27.183]  Well, of course, it was a blanket blackout, and until recently, for this getting so escalated, and I am sure, I know for a fact that neither President Trump or VP Pence know what
[02:25:27.782 --> 02:25:31.905]  The State Department and the CIA have been doing behind their backs.
[02:25:31.905 --> 02:25:43.193]  Not only that, I have received information from my sources that the Bronson couple, the so-called imposter pastor, okay, they have been a long-time Clinton supporter.
[02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:57.830]  So these people are not even the conservative Republicans, although they have been going to Vice President Pence, trying to mobilize the evangelical community to back, you know, his release.
[02:25:57.830 --> 02:26:06.216]  On the other hand, they have been cooperating with these dirty elements, Clintonite elements within the State Department and the CIA.
[02:26:06.216 --> 02:26:08.978]  And if you put the link to our video, we have
[02:26:09.458 --> 02:26:10.339]  We're good to go.
[02:26:25.118 --> 02:26:36.771]  In this very important, sensitive, diplomatic situation, it's actually crime, because it also results in someone being jailed even for a longer period.
[02:26:36.771 --> 02:26:39.053]  You're looking at an American citizen.
[02:26:39.053 --> 02:26:42.457]  Well, you're not going to hear this on the mainstream media.
[02:26:42.457 --> 02:26:46.201]  They have been trying to flame the fire, right?
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:53.563]  Blame it further by saying how horrible is Turkey and how bully is Trump.
[02:26:53.563 --> 02:27:02.427]  Basically, they are making both countries look awful and they can't wait for a major international disaster between the two nations.
[02:27:02.427 --> 02:27:04.908]  Do you know why, Alex?
[02:27:04.908 --> 02:27:07.770]  Because the Clintonites, they haven't given up.
[02:27:07.770 --> 02:27:14.453]  What they are trying to do is, they are trying to set up President Trump and show international disasters.
[02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:18.414]  Well sure, that's what Michael Moore said when Trump was president-elect.
[02:27:18.414 --> 02:27:20.737]  He said, he said... Sorry, go ahead, sure.
[02:27:21.749 --> 02:27:26.531]  The whole thing is, Alex, they want to say, look, he has failed in diplomacy.
[02:27:26.531 --> 02:27:31.014]  He has extended and extended the list of the United States enemies.
[02:27:31.014 --> 02:27:36.917]  The same people... Well, that's what all these quoted foreign intelligence officials, a bunch of traitorous globalists are saying Trump's a big failure.
[02:27:36.917 --> 02:27:43.300]  But Michael Moore said, don't worry, Trump will get embarrassed in international affairs because they think that's where they can sabotage him.
[02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:44.720]  They don't want America to be great again.
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:45.401]  They say the country...
[02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:48.491]  That is the Clinton's plan.
[02:27:48.491 --> 02:27:55.933]  I know a lot of people are paying attention to what the FBI is trying to do, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.
[02:27:55.933 --> 02:27:59.575]  Sure, but the real sabotage is in the State Department and the deep state, don't we get it?
[02:27:59.575 --> 02:28:01.255]  Yes, it is.
[02:28:01.255 --> 02:28:02.096]  Absolutely.
[02:28:03.696 --> 02:28:08.637]  And, you know, just channels like you, and Newsbutt, and we are a little outlet.
[02:28:08.637 --> 02:28:12.258]  Other than us, look at CNN, look at MSNBC.
[02:28:12.258 --> 02:28:21.881]  They keep claiming that, look, NATO ally Turkey is not only a NATO ally, it's the most important NATO ally.
[02:28:21.881 --> 02:28:25.922]  Look at the geostrategic position of the Turkish.
[02:28:25.922 --> 02:28:28.683]  Okay, Turkey, it's right there on the map.
[02:28:28.683 --> 02:28:31.364]  It's on the border with Syria, with Iraq.
[02:28:31.804 --> 02:28:35.445]  With Iran, with Russia, with Ukraine, okay?
[02:28:55.626 --> 02:28:58.728]  This is Jessica Armand, founder of MyMagicMud.
[02:28:58.728 --> 02:29:03.691]  Our team helped organize a successful effort to remove fluoride from our city's water supply.

[02:31:57.152 --> 02:32:01.734]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:32:01.734 --> 02:32:02.294]  Thanks for calling.
[02:32:02.294 --> 02:32:03.714]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:32:03.714 --> 02:32:07.335]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:32:07.335 --> 02:32:16.078]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:32:16.218 --> 02:32:32.374]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Supermail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[02:32:32.854 --> 02:32:41.463]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:32:41.463 --> 02:32:46.369]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:32:46.369 --> 02:32:51.974]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1775th Worldwide.
[02:32:59.395 --> 02:33:03.416]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:03.416 --> 02:33:14.480]  I've got a good woman at home Who thinks I do no wrong
[02:33:29.156 --> 02:33:30.738]  Here's the deal.
[02:33:30.738 --> 02:33:35.563]  We've got a great guest in the fourth hour.
[02:33:35.563 --> 02:33:40.548]  Mike Adams, who was here yesterday.
[02:33:51.724 --> 02:33:55.808]  And I might just stay with him during that as well, because there's so much to break down.
[02:33:55.808 --> 02:33:59.471]  I kind of want to take your phone calls, too, to get your take on all this that's going on.
[02:33:59.471 --> 02:34:01.373]  Listen, I'm not worried about Infowars.
[02:34:01.373 --> 02:34:02.214]  I'm worried about you.
[02:34:02.214 --> 02:34:04.556]  I'm worried about the country.
[02:34:04.556 --> 02:34:05.437]  I'm worried about the future.
[02:34:05.437 --> 02:34:07.799]  I mean, I know the Democrats hate America.
[02:34:07.799 --> 02:34:09.040]  I know they hate Christians.
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:10.161]  I know they hate free market.
[02:34:10.161 --> 02:34:10.902]  I've been telling you that.
[02:34:11.482 --> 02:34:16.405]  And that's what goes on at these universities, these corporations, is this elitism by the controllers.
[02:34:16.405 --> 02:34:27.392]  But then the average leftist is this depressed, freaked out, weird beta male or female that actually thinks their captors are their friends.
[02:34:27.392 --> 02:34:33.876]  And it is just crazy how they love Venezuela, they love Cuba, they love North Korea, they love China.
[02:34:33.876 --> 02:34:36.337]  They have no idea what it is.
[02:34:36.337 --> 02:34:36.998]  They just love it.
[02:34:39.301 --> 02:34:47.109]  And so it's very exciting to see people all over the internet rallying for InfoWars and promoting us everywhere, and that's very important.
[02:34:47.109 --> 02:34:52.394]  But while you do that, we're posting a video to the front page of InfoWars.com right now.
[02:34:52.394 --> 02:34:54.456]  For some reason it doesn't refresh on the computers here.
[02:34:54.456 --> 02:34:56.678]  We're working through those.
[02:34:56.678 --> 02:35:00.942]  We still have a big story from yesterday, false flag coming.
[02:35:00.942 --> 02:35:03.384]  Which is the most critical story out there, but we have another one about
[02:35:04.528 --> 02:35:11.651]  China and the EU are already regulating the internet because our government has a lot of vacuum.
[02:35:11.651 --> 02:35:15.413]  It's great to say you're for free trade unless the other countries have giant tariffs on you.
[02:35:15.413 --> 02:35:17.294]  Oh, we have no tariffs, we're free trade.
[02:35:17.294 --> 02:35:18.894]  Okay, we've got a 200% one, a 300% one.
[02:35:18.894 --> 02:35:23.276]  Okay, we're going to stay at zero.
[02:35:23.276 --> 02:35:24.497]  I have a non-violence policy.
[02:35:24.497 --> 02:35:26.858]  They're like, we have a policy to hit you in the head with a baseball bat 55 times.
[02:35:32.130 --> 02:35:33.491]  It's like we have a no-smoking policy.
[02:35:33.491 --> 02:35:36.593]  Somebody lights a cigarette and goes, I don't have one.
[02:35:36.593 --> 02:35:37.454]  It blows right in your face.
[02:35:37.454 --> 02:35:41.896]  I mean, we better protect the internet now.
[02:35:41.896 --> 02:35:48.721]  Obama took it over, got a bunch of laws passed to let them regulate, let them shut down free speech, let them have immunity.
[02:35:48.721 --> 02:35:55.125]  The right-wingers, Pi, just reversed that, which was good, but now it's a free-for-all.
[02:35:55.125 --> 02:35:57.167]  And while this vacuum's open, it's like saying, well,
[02:35:58.379 --> 02:35:59.860]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:04.261]  So I'm not going to have a submarine bulkhead door.
[02:36:04.261 --> 02:36:08.923]  Well, as soon as the submarine goes underwater, the submarine floods.
[02:36:08.923 --> 02:36:11.284]  It's like the couple with some other Europeans.
[02:36:11.284 --> 02:36:14.045]  They were American government workers.
[02:36:14.045 --> 02:36:15.305]  They said, oh, we're sick of this.
[02:36:15.305 --> 02:36:16.745]  The world is love.
[02:36:16.745 --> 02:36:22.948]  We're going to bicycle through Al Qaeda territory and hug them.
[02:36:22.948 --> 02:36:24.708]  Well, they didn't have to find Al Qaeda.
[02:36:24.708 --> 02:36:26.469]  Al Qaeda found them, ran them off the road.
[02:36:27.847 --> 02:36:33.990]  Ran him over, got out and stabbed him to death.
[02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:39.813]  They found out about the love.
[02:36:39.813 --> 02:36:44.495]  Let me tell you, there's some serious mental illness going on at Big Tech in San Francisco.
[02:36:44.495 --> 02:36:48.257]  It's in the news that they have poop all over the ground everywhere.
[02:36:48.257 --> 02:36:49.638]  Just mentally ill people everywhere.
[02:36:54.639 --> 02:36:59.242]  And the left will just crush anything American, anything strong, anything successful.
[02:36:59.242 --> 02:37:04.345]  They just revel because they're beta cucks who grew up and thought they weren't powerful.
[02:37:04.345 --> 02:37:07.086]  And the university went, it's okay, you're a leftist.
[02:37:07.086 --> 02:37:10.989]  You're in control, just hate America now.
[02:37:10.989 --> 02:37:12.249]  And you'll be in charge of it.
[02:37:12.249 --> 02:37:17.573]  So America is what gives them water, what gives them food, what gives them sunlight, like they're a plant.
[02:37:17.573 --> 02:37:19.774]  They're wanting to chop the tree down
[02:37:25.106 --> 02:37:27.148]  Because they think it's better than them.
[02:37:27.148 --> 02:37:33.814]  They have an inferiority complex when there's all these other countries and collapsed systems that just want to murder you.
[02:37:33.814 --> 02:37:35.296]  Where women are slaves, you name it.
[02:37:35.296 --> 02:37:38.259]  Where it's super hellish, super dangerous.
[02:37:38.259 --> 02:37:41.141]  No culture, no architecture, nothing.
[02:37:41.141 --> 02:37:42.543]  No classical liberalism.
[02:37:42.543 --> 02:37:46.867]  And you have all these weird, spoiled, rotten tyrants that say they're the liberals, but they're not.
[02:37:46.867 --> 02:37:47.888]  They're the destructors.
[02:37:50.765 --> 02:37:54.267]  So I heard that Apple banned Alex Jones and InfoWars from their iTunes store.
[02:38:19.295 --> 02:38:24.280]  We just wanted to leave them with a little gift.
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:26.383]  And again, she went to all the computers and put InfoWars.com on.
[02:38:26.383 --> 02:38:38.976]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is undoubtedly the most important broadcast I've ever done in my life.
[02:38:38.976 --> 02:38:40.117]  Emergency alert, false flag.
[02:38:40.117 --> 02:38:41.759]  That has hundreds of thousands of views right now.
[02:38:44.096 --> 02:38:48.665]  And if everybody does stuff like that, it will totally blow up in their face big time.
[02:38:48.665 --> 02:38:50.709]  Let's go to the next one.
[02:38:50.709 --> 02:38:56.299]  This is a sync edit of Lester Holt reveals descriptive
[02:38:57.455 --> 02:38:59.996]  And deceptive edit techniques used against Alex Jones.
[02:38:59.996 --> 02:39:03.697]  Now let's be clear, Lester Holt is not a pedophile, at least that I know.
[02:39:03.697 --> 02:39:08.279]  These are edits of him talking about children and child molestation cases.
[02:39:08.279 --> 02:39:16.782]  But according to Lester Holt's standard, where he didn't show a clip, he just read quotes that were each word out of context, put together where I said attack the media with assault rifles.
[02:39:18.157 --> 02:39:24.119]  The New York Times did it, thousands of publications, but he put it out with Jack Dorsey and said, Jack, I get chills up my spine.
[02:39:24.119 --> 02:39:27.000]  He says he wants people to criminally kill us with guns.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.121]  Never said any of that.
[02:39:30.121 --> 02:39:34.342]  In fact, at least with this clip, we take real things he said and then put them together.
[02:39:34.342 --> 02:39:39.844]  In their stories, it'll be one word, two words, one word, then they fill in the blanks.
[02:39:39.844 --> 02:39:44.906]  They don't even have the words to put it together, so they even make those up.
[02:39:48.354 --> 02:39:54.138]  So, this isn't even as nasty as the way he did to Ush, but here's an example of deceptive editing.
[02:39:54.138 --> 02:39:57.080]  Here it is.
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:01.763]  On August 15, 2018, Lester Holt claimed Alex Jones called for people to use battle rifles against a tech journalist.
[02:40:01.763 --> 02:40:06.145]  He did this by playing word game salad with different words that Alex Jones had said at different times.
[02:40:06.145 --> 02:40:11.629]  Lester Holt dishonestly recombined those words into a whole new fake sentence they claimed that was Alex actually said.
[02:40:13.883 --> 02:40:17.705]  Let's use the same technique and see what Lester Holt might be planning to upset.
[02:40:17.705 --> 02:40:19.025]  Indulge me for just a moment.
[02:40:19.025 --> 02:40:25.068]  I think my reputation was sullied by the little boy in the little boy in... He's only four, but he's ready.
[02:40:25.068 --> 02:40:27.830]  In the end, uh, you know, we got a good amount of time since 2005.
[02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:30.751]  Now I'm gonna get to spend more time.
[02:40:30.751 --> 02:40:35.433]  And, uh, I'm expected to face criminal charges related to sexual abuse.
[02:40:35.433 --> 02:40:36.914]  Dude, you made a mistake!
[02:40:36.914 --> 02:40:37.294]  Wrong name!
[02:40:37.594 --> 02:40:43.801]  But I really like the little boy, and the little boy, and I don't know whether he thinks it went badly or, you know, it's not for me to judge.
[02:40:43.801 --> 02:40:51.189]  I remember that, you know, talking to his family, and I just love a little boy in a good way, which I'm gonna continue doing, but not in other places.
[02:40:51.189 --> 02:40:52.110]  That's what I wanted to say.
[02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:52.971]  Yeah, okay.
[02:40:52.971 --> 02:40:56.575]  So if you have any great ideas about sneaking in a little boy, I'm all ears.
[02:40:56.575 --> 02:40:56.995]  Of course.
[02:40:56.995 --> 02:40:58.096]  Yeah, I'm very happy, yeah.
[02:41:00.287 --> 02:41:07.053]  That's Brian Williams, the guy that said he was shot down by RPGs in a helicopter, it was all lies.
[02:41:07.053 --> 02:41:11.016]  So that's who they replaced him with, is another big fat liar, Buck Lester Holt.
[02:41:11.016 --> 02:41:19.303]  So Holt, you just looked at a piece of paper of edited words and said I said something, which is even worse, that I'm calling for violence.
[02:41:19.303 --> 02:41:23.927]  I said that was fake.
[02:41:23.927 --> 02:41:26.369]  But still, you'll probably get pissed off.
[02:41:26.369 --> 02:41:27.791]  I know this, you molest the truth.
[02:41:29.301 --> 02:41:31.423]  You, you, you, you sit there and defame people.
[02:41:31.423 --> 02:41:38.248]  You are a fraud like the king of fake news, Ryan Williams.
[02:41:38.248 --> 02:41:39.489]  And you'll go that same way.
[02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:41.691]  What a sick, evil freak, man.
[02:41:43.191 --> 02:41:47.735]  I played it already yesterday, Drudge Report linked to it, and I just want to say thank God for DrudgeReport.com.
[02:41:47.735 --> 02:41:51.398]  Seriously, Drudge has taken us over the top time and time again.
[02:41:51.398 --> 02:41:54.921]  Without DrudgeReport.com, we would be in deep trouble, so thank you.
[02:41:54.921 --> 02:41:57.763]  Speaking of disinformation, when we come back, I'm going to hit another big one.
[02:41:57.763 --> 02:42:04.469]  I'll get into the dozens of former intel officials, all globalist traitors, all people that helped spy on Trump illegally, all enemies of the country, in my view.
[02:42:05.229 --> 02:42:07.692]  Uh, how they're bitching about his speech being taken.
[02:42:07.692 --> 02:42:08.893]  Brennan's speech!
[02:42:08.893 --> 02:42:15.620]  He doesn't still get national security briefings, so he can spin it to the media and sell it to CNN and spawn, My God, his speech is gone!
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:18.443]  The very same CNN, calling for me to be silenced.
[02:42:20.114 --> 02:42:22.076]  Brian Stelter, how dare Trump criticize us?
[02:42:22.076 --> 02:42:23.217]  That silences the media.
[02:42:23.217 --> 02:42:26.060]  No, criticizing known liars is telling the truth.
[02:42:26.060 --> 02:42:30.104]  You're the ones calling for us to be silenced and you do it the same programs.
[02:42:30.104 --> 02:42:31.705]  You are anti-free speech police.
[02:42:31.705 --> 02:42:33.467]  You are the enemy of the country.
[02:42:33.467 --> 02:42:34.848]  Does that mean I want violence against you?
[02:42:34.848 --> 02:42:34.888]  No!
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:38.482]  You're the ones politically trying to shut me down.
[02:42:38.482 --> 02:42:40.324]  I'm politically exposing you.
[02:42:40.324 --> 02:42:42.926]  And we know when those terror attacks come against you that you're going to stage.
[02:42:42.926 --> 02:42:44.027]  We didn't do it.
[02:42:44.027 --> 02:42:45.669]  You have hyped it up and got it prepared.
[02:42:45.669 --> 02:42:48.531]  It's so obvious what you're about to do before the midterms.
[02:42:48.531 --> 02:42:50.754]  I have to expose it so they can't pull it off.
[02:42:50.754 --> 02:42:53.816]  But to do that, I need the audience to spread those videos and vote for us.

[02:43:55.444 --> 02:43:59.389]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.389 --> 02:44:02.173]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:02.173 --> 02:44:08.962]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:08.962 --> 02:44:11.725]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:12.466 --> 02:44:16.269]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.269 --> 02:44:22.753]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.753 --> 02:44:27.717]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.467 --> 02:44:32.390]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.390 --> 02:44:39.574]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.574 --> 02:44:44.818]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.818 --> 02:44:50.501]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.501 --> 02:44:54.464]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.553 --> 02:45:02.815]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[02:46:52.983 --> 02:46:55.745]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:09.368]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.368 --> 02:47:27.902]  On a warm summer's eve On a train bound for nowhere We met up with a gambler We were both too tired to sleep So we took turns of staring Out the window at the darkness
[02:47:28.831 --> 02:47:30.393]  He said, son I've made a life
[02:47:37.689 --> 02:47:51.438]  Listen, we're trying as hard as we can to get the word out.
[02:47:51.438 --> 02:47:56.021]  There's about to be a bunch of new videos posted to InfoWars.com on that splash page we put up.
[02:47:56.021 --> 02:47:56.862]  They're trying to censor.
[02:47:56.862 --> 02:48:01.025]  I'm asking all of you to download them, re-upload them wherever you can, get them out to everybody.
[02:48:02.202 --> 02:48:06.305]  I want to thank all the folks that have been spreading the articles, that have been putting up posters around the country.
[02:48:06.305 --> 02:48:13.670]  We've retweeted that on Paul Watson's Twitter, where people are putting up signs, AlexJones and 4Wars.com for voting information.
[02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:16.512]  America and the world is fighting back against this censorship.
[02:48:16.512 --> 02:48:18.654]  But I've got some really scary news here.
[02:48:18.654 --> 02:48:22.716]  They never release in high-profile cases the names of the jurors until after...
[02:48:23.996 --> 02:48:28.439]  The ruling, and then they see if the jurors want their names released.
[02:48:28.439 --> 02:48:38.407]  But CNN, BuzzFeed, and other George Soros terror organizations that have literally called all our sponsors and threatened them that they're going to write stories against them until they leave us.
[02:48:38.407 --> 02:48:44.972]  And who go around lobbying for us to be taken off the air everywhere because no one watches them, and they're dirtbag scum.
[02:48:44.972 --> 02:48:47.954]  Judge Amanda Fortrall says he's already been threatened over the case.
[02:48:49.284 --> 02:48:58.409]  He says the media is basically threatening him and demanding that they release the names of the jurors while they deliberate, I guess, so their families can be properly threatened.
[02:48:58.409 --> 02:49:07.453]  Because the jurors came out today and said, we want to know about reasonable doubt.
[02:49:07.453 --> 02:49:13.997]  And it looks like they're getting ready to equip Manafort, and so CNN and other terrorist organizations, and they call me a terrorist,
[02:49:14.974 --> 02:49:16.255]  So you're like, well why are you calling them one?
[02:49:16.255 --> 02:49:18.778]  Because the terrorist is who attacks and calls you a terrorist.
[02:49:18.778 --> 02:49:22.041]  The terrorist is who says take you off the air.
[02:49:22.041 --> 02:49:24.183]  That makes them what they say I am.
[02:49:24.183 --> 02:49:27.286]  I mean, CNN is already taking itself off the air.
[02:49:27.286 --> 02:49:33.072]  They have to pay to be on airports, bus terminals, public spaces, hotels.
[02:49:33.072 --> 02:49:34.914]  We don't have to pay to do that.
[02:49:34.914 --> 02:49:37.877]  But they want us off the air, which shows what degenerates they are.
[02:49:39.406 --> 02:50:04.368]  A coalition of news outlets, you mean terrorists, anti-free speech groups, including CNN, the New York Times, this is the criminal brigade, BuzzFeed, give the same group, and the Washington Post, that's all them, Bezos, Carlos Slim, the Chai Kongs, George Soros, BuzzFeed, and the Washington Post want the federal government, federal judge presiding over the Paul Manafort case, to unseal the names of addresses of the jurors deliberating the case.
[02:50:04.368 --> 02:50:05.849]  Wow, I've never seen that before.
[02:50:08.686 --> 02:50:12.307]  And you know that's for jury tampering, so here's your headline.
[02:50:12.307 --> 02:50:17.889]  MSM terrorists call for jurors' names to be released so they can threaten them and tamper with the jury.
[02:50:17.889 --> 02:50:24.931]  And believe me, CNN's been tampering, trying to take my kids away, trying to get me bankrupted, trying to get me sued.
[02:50:24.931 --> 02:50:28.632]  We're on thousands and thousands, you know, of the year's stations.
[02:50:28.632 --> 02:50:30.912]  We're on close to a thousand right now in total.
[02:50:30.912 --> 02:50:32.233]  UHF, VHF, cable.
[02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:39.414]  AMFM, they find some little micro station, anybody can buy a kit online, I don't even know if it's on air still.
[02:50:39.414 --> 02:50:41.135]  I think years ago there was some micro in town.
[02:50:41.135 --> 02:50:43.816]  I think they're good people, but this new group I don't even know.
[02:50:43.816 --> 02:50:47.398]  I met the lady, she was an anti-fluoride activist.
[02:50:47.398 --> 02:50:50.080]  They go, Jones has been raided, his illegal station taken down.
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:55.683]  I don't broadcast, I'm not on any broadcast stations that I own.
[02:50:55.683 --> 02:50:58.045]  I send out a transmission on satellite.
[02:50:59.517 --> 02:51:00.899]  And over fiber optic.
[02:51:00.899 --> 02:51:02.982]  There's no transmitters here.
[02:51:02.982 --> 02:51:07.388]  But this is their fraud, and this is what they did.
[02:51:07.388 --> 02:51:15.139]  And they've had this country under their control so long, they just think that they are totally and completely invincible.
[02:51:17.774 --> 02:51:20.056]  Alex Jones is pirate radio station.
[02:51:20.056 --> 02:51:21.097]  That's time.
[02:51:21.097 --> 02:51:28.565]  We got more than a dozen publications to retract it and say it's not my radio station, but Time Magazine doesn't care they're not to.
[02:51:28.565 --> 02:51:34.751]  Just to illustrate this info, at least Radio Inc.
[02:51:34.751 --> 02:51:36.332]  got it right, along with some others.
[02:51:36.332 --> 02:51:37.734]  Alex Jones, I'm not a pirate.
[02:51:38.897 --> 02:51:47.186]  After a barrage of news reports Thursday that a pirate radio station in Austin turns out was off for like a year, they just made all this up.
[02:51:47.186 --> 02:51:50.229]  But imagine, oh, a pirate station got shut down a year ago?
[02:51:50.229 --> 02:51:51.350]  Carried Alex Jones sometimes?
[02:51:51.350 --> 02:51:52.552]  Well, say it's him.
[02:51:52.552 --> 02:51:54.494]  Say he's been arrested, see?
[02:51:54.494 --> 02:51:56.076]  That creates that illusion that we're being shut down.
[02:51:57.381 --> 02:51:59.063]  Because that's what people are trying to demoralize you.
[02:51:59.063 --> 02:52:00.144]  America was never great.
[02:52:00.144 --> 02:52:01.045]  It's never going to be great.
[02:52:01.045 --> 02:52:02.166]  It's never coming back.
[02:52:02.166 --> 02:52:03.668]  We're going to have a depression next year.
[02:52:03.668 --> 02:52:04.990]  China's better than us.
[02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:05.991]  This is Hollywood.
[02:52:05.991 --> 02:52:13.019]  After a barrage of news reports Thursday that a pirate radio station in Austin was airing Alex Jones content, Alex Jones issued a statement on his InfoWars website.
[02:52:13.019 --> 02:52:16.262]  He said he does not operate any radio and TV stations anywhere in the country.
[02:52:17.043 --> 02:52:24.672]  And claims that his running an illegal radio station in Austin are complete and totally a hoax by mainstream corporate media to imply that the world that is broadcast is somehow illegal.
[02:52:24.672 --> 02:52:35.724]  Jones also pointed out that even the FCC chimed in on the matter stating, it's important to make clear that our pirate radio station efforts, including this one, have nothing to do with the content of the pirate radio station's air.
[02:52:36.912 --> 02:52:42.835]  We act against pirate radio stations because they are violating the law and broadcasting the FM airwaves without a license.
[02:52:42.835 --> 02:52:54.462]  Jones stated that he legally and lawfully transmitted our broadcasts, like every other TV and radio station in the world, to affiliates that have licenses on cable TV, broadcast TV, and FM radio stations.
[02:52:54.462 --> 02:53:01.286]  Media reports the contrary are implying that our broadcast is illegal by preying on the public's ignorance on broadcasting and how it works.
[02:53:01.866 --> 02:53:04.727]  We do not have a radio station or a TV station.
[02:53:04.727 --> 02:53:05.887]  This is a giant hoax.
[02:53:05.887 --> 02:53:13.049]  There are thousands of micro radio stations across the country that we have nothing to do with, including the recently shut down station.
[02:53:13.049 --> 02:53:19.371]  Now, I would add that if you're not interfering with a commercial station, you're, you know, in the middle of nowhere, you're in open frequency.
[02:53:19.371 --> 02:53:22.032]  In this day and age of censorship, I'm all for it.
[02:53:23.541 --> 02:53:25.823]  But I'm not pushing pirate radio.
[02:53:25.823 --> 02:53:26.965]  We don't broadcast.
[02:53:26.965 --> 02:53:29.928]  We don't have a TV station or a radio station.
[02:53:29.928 --> 02:53:31.930]  If I wanted to buy stations, I could.
[02:53:31.930 --> 02:53:34.112]  We are a provider to stations.
[02:53:34.112 --> 02:53:41.740]  But for them to cherry-pick some station off since last year, that I thought was off for like three years, because you used to... different people ran it.
[02:53:41.740 --> 02:53:43.142]  Hold it, Liberty Radio had different stuff on.
[02:53:43.142 --> 02:53:44.003]  They'd air me sometimes.
[02:53:45.555 --> 02:53:47.777]  But, you know, three or four years ago, you couldn't find it anymore.
[02:53:47.777 --> 02:53:48.818]  So I'd like tune around.
[02:53:48.818 --> 02:53:50.800]  Well, I just got my iPad or my phone.
[02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:52.341]  You don't hear a show, boom, it's right there.
[02:53:52.341 --> 02:53:56.384]  So the idea that like, look, Jones got raided or Jones got shut down.
[02:53:56.384 --> 02:54:06.373]  I didn't even know who the people were until I saw a photo in the paper and I went, that lady is an anti-fluoride activist.
[02:54:06.373 --> 02:54:08.115]  She came in here with a lady running for city council.
[02:54:09.304 --> 02:54:12.487]  And never said, by the way, we run your micro FM or whatever.
[02:54:12.487 --> 02:54:13.949]  The point is, I'm not hiding from that fact.
[02:54:13.949 --> 02:54:17.192]  I actually support it if you're on your fair and commercial stations.
[02:54:17.192 --> 02:54:24.140]  But the fracas I heard was they were filling up the FM band three, four years ago and put a Christian station that got the license on that.
[02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:26.702]  And there's no more areas for micros.
[02:54:26.702 --> 02:54:28.224]  It's what people that do it call it.
[02:54:28.224 --> 02:54:29.706]  It's called pirate by the FCC.
[02:54:29.706 --> 02:54:30.326]  But here's the deal.
[02:54:31.267 --> 02:54:39.719]  I can't keep track of our 200 plus affiliates, some of them 50,000 watt AM's, you know, 100,000 watt FM's, which I should have all that down.
[02:54:39.719 --> 02:54:42.342]  Those are precious and wonderful and great.
[02:54:42.342 --> 02:54:45.486]  The idea that some half a watt thing in Austin
[02:54:46.795 --> 02:54:49.156]  That I haven't been able to hear for three, four years.
[02:54:49.156 --> 02:54:52.457]  That I'm like, oh my station, my flagship.
[02:54:52.457 --> 02:54:55.598]  We're number one on the iTunes app, Android.
[02:54:55.598 --> 02:54:57.718]  We were number one on YouTube.
[02:54:57.718 --> 02:55:00.759]  We're being shut down because we're number one.
[02:55:00.759 --> 02:55:04.920]  And I'm not putting down folks that have us on micros, that's great.
[02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:14.783]  The idea though, that like our flagship station, that went out a mile, that I haven't even heard in years and don't even know the people that run it.
[02:55:16.317 --> 02:55:18.903]  Is insane.
[02:55:18.903 --> 02:55:22.511]  But that's how they pitch this garbage.
[02:55:23.470 --> 02:55:25.211]  The video is now live at Infowars.com.
[02:55:25.211 --> 02:55:28.794]  Emergency, the EU and China are already regulating the US internet.
[02:55:28.794 --> 02:55:30.575]  There's another emergency message to Congress.
[02:55:30.575 --> 02:55:33.137]  Please, please get them to Congress.
[02:55:33.137 --> 02:55:33.858]  They're so afraid.
[02:55:33.858 --> 02:55:35.079]  It's why they're censoring us.
[02:55:35.079 --> 02:55:38.221]  Get this video to every member of Congress, every talk show host.
[02:55:38.221 --> 02:55:40.203]  This is why they're taking us off air.
[02:55:40.203 --> 02:55:41.243]  This is the takeover.
[02:55:41.243 --> 02:55:42.644]  This is so critical.
[02:55:42.644 --> 02:55:47.168]  We're going to more and more have a splash page on Infowars with whatever the most censored, hardcore info is.
[02:55:47.168 --> 02:55:50.370]  You just click below to go to Infowars.com itself, Newswars.com, you name it.
[02:55:52.199 --> 02:55:58.691]  You'd think with us, them taking $3 million of our sponsors away, taking Credio away, after they took our ad role last year away.
[02:56:00.186 --> 02:56:00.847]  I'd be plugging.
[02:56:00.847 --> 02:56:02.769]  I'm so focused on the news and winning, I'm not.
[02:56:02.769 --> 02:56:09.416]  But listen, we've got products, whether it's air filtration or water filtration, that for the price are the very best units out there.
[02:56:09.416 --> 02:56:12.119]  Can you spend $2,000 and get a better HEPA filter?
[02:56:12.119 --> 02:56:13.000]  Yeah.
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:14.361]  The average HEPA filter is $600.
[02:56:14.361 --> 02:56:17.264]  Ours is just as good as that one, and it's $200.
[02:56:17.264 --> 02:56:18.866]  Alexa Pure Breeze, the best.
[02:56:18.866 --> 02:56:22.269]  Alexa Pure Water Filters, Pro Pure Water Filters, they're all the very best.
[02:56:23.390 --> 02:56:26.394]  The water's full of glyphosates, Roundup, all that stuff.
[02:56:26.394 --> 02:56:27.415]  You and your family need it.
[02:56:27.415 --> 02:56:31.519]  And yeah, I'm saying, the water's scary, better filter it and support us on the broadcast.
[02:56:31.519 --> 02:56:32.019]  Go there!
[02:56:32.019 --> 02:56:35.283]  Get shower filters, get water filters, get reverse osmosis, get it all!

[02:57:29.204 --> 02:57:31.044]  The new products don't have reviews yet.
[02:57:31.044 --> 02:57:32.584]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:57:32.584 --> 02:57:35.525]  Whatever you do, get products you need to fund the rebellion.
[02:57:35.525 --> 02:57:36.666]  The Globalists hope you don't.
[02:57:36.666 --> 02:57:38.346]  If you do, we're unstoppable.
[02:57:38.346 --> 02:57:39.646]  And we need those prayers as well.
[02:57:39.646 --> 02:57:41.387]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:57:41.387 --> 02:57:41.887]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.529 --> 02:57:47.890]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:57:47.890 --> 02:57:50.050]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:57:50.050 --> 02:57:53.971]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:57:53.971 --> 02:58:05.474]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:58:05.474 --> 02:58:14.577]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[02:58:31.834 --> 02:58:34.856]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[02:58:34.856 --> 02:58:36.877]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:58:36.877 --> 02:58:40.179]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:58:40.179 --> 02:58:42.721]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[02:58:42.721 --> 02:58:44.962]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com
[02:58:46.653 --> 02:58:52.217]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in 4-Hour's life.
[02:58:52.217 --> 02:58:53.098]  It'd take hours.
[02:58:53.098 --> 02:58:55.540]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:58:55.540 --> 02:58:56.721]  It's stronger.
[02:58:56.721 --> 02:58:58.322]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:58:58.322 --> 02:59:01.544]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:01.544 --> 02:59:02.665]  It's back in stock.
[02:59:02.665 --> 02:59:05.848]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.848 --> 02:59:09.631]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:59:09.631 --> 02:59:12.733]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[02:59:12.733 --> 02:59:13.614]  So you can upload it.
[02:59:13.614 --> 02:59:15.055]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[02:59:15.515 --> 02:59:22.757]  But the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[02:59:22.757 --> 02:59:23.657]  That's a spray you do.
[02:59:23.657 --> 02:59:24.998]  You can also swallow it.
[02:59:24.998 --> 02:59:30.339]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[02:59:30.339 --> 02:59:31.719]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:59:31.719 --> 02:59:41.642]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake that it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:59:41.642 --> 02:59:44.703]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:59:49.904 --> 03:00:06.511]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.511 --> 03:00:10.972]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:00:10.972 --> 03:00:12.373]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.995 --> 03:00:34.647]  All right, Mike Adams of naturalnews.com and this great new real video site that's gotten already something like 50 million views last few weeks.
[03:00:34.647 --> 03:00:36.169]  Exploding, really scaring the system.
[03:00:36.169 --> 03:00:40.033]  Tell us, Mike Adams, before I hit a few final points here, what's coming up this hour?
[03:00:41.973 --> 03:00:46.417]  Alex, we've got, we're talking about the vaccine scandal in China exploding.
[03:00:46.417 --> 03:00:51.961]  We're talking about alternatives to the browsers that are now being sold to China.
[03:00:51.961 --> 03:00:57.505]  Opera has been sold to China and Google is working with China for censorship technology.
[03:00:58.348 --> 03:01:10.341]  We've got also Chinese activists now are running a what's called a toilet revolution because the only place they can have free speech is writing on the walls of stalls in toilets in China and even then they're being arrested.
[03:01:10.341 --> 03:01:13.344]  So we've got a lot of great news coming up Alex.
[03:01:13.344 --> 03:01:14.004]  It's unbelievable.
[03:01:14.004 --> 03:01:16.207]  I'm going to ask you this question when we come back in the next segment.
[03:01:17.682 --> 03:01:26.838]  How do we get Congress to understand their inaction on regulating the internet for Internet Bill of Rights and free speech is allowing the EU and China to come into the vacuum.
[03:01:26.838 --> 03:01:29.403]  That's my main mission and it's a national security issue.
[03:01:29.403 --> 03:01:30.244]  Lockheed Martin...
[03:01:31.539 --> 03:01:35.882]  Or other defense contractors like Laurel, Hughes, you name it.
[03:01:35.882 --> 03:01:39.485]  They don't say, oh, we're a corporation, we can sell stuff to whoever we want.
[03:01:39.485 --> 03:01:40.026]  No.
[03:01:40.026 --> 03:01:44.269]  You were here, you got our money, we paid you as taxpayers, you don't sell us out.
[03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:45.890]  Globalism is about being a traitor.
[03:01:45.890 --> 03:01:46.791]  So that's the big issue.
[03:01:46.791 --> 03:01:52.235]  Giving up the internet we built, allowing foreign actors to come in and regulate it, is a national security issue.
[03:01:52.235 --> 03:01:55.157]  Securing internet freedom is a national security issue.
[03:01:55.157 --> 03:01:58.379]  And I know for a fact, we're being shut down for exposing that.
[03:01:58.379 --> 03:02:00.041]  And as you said in the last month on the show, Mike,
[03:02:01.004 --> 03:02:05.332]  Exposing the plan that they're going to false flag mainstream media or big tech and blame us.
[03:02:05.332 --> 03:02:08.056]  It's a sure thing in the next 81 days.
[03:02:08.056 --> 03:02:09.820]  And we've got to get ahead of that right now, Mike.
[03:02:10.828 --> 03:02:18.012]  Absolutely, and it's increasingly clear that China is the blueprint for the censorship tyranny rollout in America.
[03:02:18.012 --> 03:02:18.772]  It's happening now.
[03:02:18.772 --> 03:02:26.756]  So Google creates censorship technology for China that even their own employees are now protesting against, and then they roll that out in America.
[03:02:26.756 --> 03:02:31.438]  It won't be long before the Chrome browser itself starts blocking independent media.
[03:02:31.438 --> 03:02:39.242]  We're also hearing that Mozilla Firefox is also on track to start blocking independent media at the browser level.
[03:02:39.882 --> 03:02:43.646]  And the next step beyond that, Alex, is of course domain seizures.
[03:02:43.646 --> 03:02:49.912]  So if we don't stop this censorship now, eventually they're just going to seize all our domains and shut us off that way.
[03:02:49.912 --> 03:03:00.162]  So they're going to block you being able to type in naturalnews.com or influencers.com and the final holy grail is this global social score, which even the Wall Street Journal admits is being adopted here by big tech.
[03:03:00.162 --> 03:03:02.023]  They're not going to just have a bunch of different systems for the world.
[03:03:02.023 --> 03:03:04.426]  They're adopting the Chinese model and the EU model.
[03:03:05.186 --> 03:03:18.721]  And by Congress not being involved, it allows them to come in with a regulation, and they're openly saying that they're going to block everybody, have a global social score, with an internet ID, which Facebook's already calling for your banking info, and then it's done.
[03:03:18.721 --> 03:03:23.927]  Once they get this, it's over, we go into 1984 slash Mark of the Beast.
[03:03:23.927 --> 03:03:26.870]  They're also wanting your medical information.
[03:03:28.098 --> 03:03:46.632]  All your hospital records, plus your banking records as you mentioned, we're rapidly entering a dark ages of tyranny and police state oppression where you have zero privacy, you have zero rights, and just like what's happening in China right now, the only place you will be able to speak freely is scribbling on a toilet stall wall.
[03:03:46.632 --> 03:03:50.454]  That's what China has been reduced to, and that's what it's coming to in the United States.
[03:03:50.454 --> 03:03:53.577]  I saw that article now, the government's putting cameras in the stalls.
[03:03:53.577 --> 03:03:54.377]  Right, of course.
[03:03:54.377 --> 03:03:55.318]  It's insane.
[03:03:57.364 --> 03:03:59.126]  This is what it's coming to, Alex.
[03:03:59.126 --> 03:04:00.567]  Again, this has to be stopped.
[03:04:00.567 --> 03:04:04.091]  These tech giants will not voluntarily stop their censorship.
[03:04:04.091 --> 03:04:09.136]  The President or Congress is going to have to get involved and take some decisive action.
[03:04:09.136 --> 03:04:14.122]  If they don't, we lose any last remnant of the First Amendment in America.
[03:04:14.932 --> 03:04:18.174]  And then again they do this thing, well we're Heritage Foundation, we're Free Market.
[03:04:18.174 --> 03:04:19.214]  Free Market?
[03:04:19.214 --> 03:04:24.658]  The EU and China are already running internet regulation and Google and all of them are getting in bed and following it.
[03:04:24.658 --> 03:04:25.998]  You idiots!
[03:04:25.998 --> 03:04:26.979]  You morons!
[03:04:26.979 --> 03:04:28.820]  You buffoons!
[03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:33.122]  Soros said during the election two years ago he wanted to have full web control but he only got his articles.
[03:04:33.122 --> 03:04:34.763]  Well it's happening now.
[03:04:34.763 --> 03:04:37.285]  Alex Jones calls on Trump to defend the First Amendment.
[03:04:37.785 --> 03:04:40.769]  That was a week ago, and we've been banned since then.
[03:04:40.769 --> 03:04:45.056]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, please support us.
[03:04:45.056 --> 03:04:48.441]  We'll be back on the other side with Mike Adams.
[03:04:48.441 --> 03:04:49.122]  Infowars.com.
[03:04:54.346 --> 03:04:55.706]  We knew it was coming.
[03:04:55.706 --> 03:04:57.147]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:04:57.147 --> 03:05:10.410]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:05:10.410 --> 03:05:11.391]  And then voila!
[03:05:11.391 --> 03:05:21.434]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[03:05:21.434 --> 03:05:22.334]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[03:05:23.194 --> 03:05:23.894]  We're good to go.
[03:05:52.560 --> 03:06:05.329]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:06:05.329 --> 03:06:07.971]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:07.971 --> 03:06:15.356]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:15.356 --> 03:06:16.257]  Hey, listener!
[03:06:17.305 --> 03:06:22.330]  In Miami tweeted this image that it's up on my one of the Twitters we've still got up.
[03:06:22.330 --> 03:06:24.892]  I forget which one but we did tweet it out earlier.
[03:06:24.892 --> 03:06:26.754]  Maybe we can ask the IT guys to tell us.
[03:06:26.754 --> 03:06:29.016]  We'll tell people but who knows.
[03:06:29.016 --> 03:06:32.599]  Infowars.com is forbidden information.
[03:06:32.599 --> 03:06:37.643]  I love how in Miami it got taped over here where they had no
[03:06:40.034 --> 03:06:44.078]  In the name of humanity, we refuse to accept a fascist America.
[03:06:44.078 --> 03:06:47.842]  And that's that George Soros-funded anti-free speech group.
[03:06:47.842 --> 03:06:49.464]  So there it is.
[03:06:49.464 --> 03:06:51.506]  In the land of betas, Brian Stelter is king.
[03:06:51.506 --> 03:06:58.713]  In the land of America, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is number one.
[03:06:58.713 --> 03:07:01.035]  And hey, don't, you know, just get our image and do that.
[03:07:01.897 --> 03:07:02.878]  I appreciate people doing that.
[03:07:02.878 --> 03:07:10.025]  Everybody go out, whatever you believe in, whatever your idea is, we don't want to get to the level where we're only scribbling on bathroom walls and hanging stuff on poles at night.
[03:07:10.025 --> 03:07:15.110]  Let's do it now, ahead of time, because that's where we've gotten to, and Mike Adams is about to take over.
[03:07:16.593 --> 03:07:17.454]  And break that down.
[03:07:17.454 --> 03:07:21.478]  But before I go any further, because I didn't plug very good today, and I'm our biggest problem.
[03:07:21.478 --> 03:07:23.460]  When I plug a few times an hour, we're bringing in plenty of money.
[03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:27.684]  When I plug twice in three, four hours, we're going to go down the tubes.
[03:07:27.684 --> 03:07:39.515]  They took Credio, which was a big advertising platform, that they're an ad agency, they take your money, they put your ads for water filters, air filters, non-GMO heirloom seeds, and supplements.
[03:07:41.089 --> 03:07:48.432]  Kids fish oil, vitamin mineral, you know, fusion, just really high quality stuff.
[03:07:48.432 --> 03:07:54.314]  They said, that's hate, after we've been with them over a year and a half and spent millions of dollars with them, even though they approached us.
[03:07:54.314 --> 03:07:59.016]  So, three million dollars to fund our operation, that's what we brought in.
[03:07:59.016 --> 03:08:00.337]  That was gross.
[03:08:00.337 --> 03:08:04.379]  A lot of it was advertising and the cost of product, but a million and a half, whatever it was, money.
[03:08:04.379 --> 03:08:04.939]  That's all gone.
[03:08:05.879 --> 03:08:06.960]  People are like, well, where's my bonus?
[03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:07.660]  Where's my raise?
[03:08:07.660 --> 03:08:14.025]  Well, it ain't been laid off yet, so... I don't want to get up there and say, God, they're beating the living hell out of us, because I'm like John Paul Jones.
[03:08:14.025 --> 03:08:15.767]  My ship's sinking, I'm still fighting.
[03:08:15.767 --> 03:08:17.308]  I've only begun to fight, then I end up winning.
[03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:21.891]  And I believe in you, but we need financial support.
[03:08:21.891 --> 03:08:25.612]  Plus, we've got, just like our information's game-changing, our products are amazing.

[03:09:04.673 --> 03:09:05.334]  That sale...
[03:09:07.082 --> 03:09:08.463]  It has to end very, very soon.
[03:09:08.463 --> 03:09:12.366]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:09:12.366 --> 03:09:14.448]  I want to be clear.
[03:09:14.448 --> 03:09:19.211]  Those of you that have funded us over the years and that have been steadfast, you are the tip of the spear.
[03:09:19.211 --> 03:09:24.996]  But if you're a listener and you haven't, you're like, okay, vitamins, supplements, oh, water filters, oh, t-shirts, oh, whatever.
[03:09:26.647 --> 03:09:28.407]  This is serious war.
[03:09:28.407 --> 03:09:31.188]  And I don't want Soros and Hillary and the Globals to win.
[03:09:31.188 --> 03:09:37.570]  They're so scared of us because we've got the guest, we've got the research, we've got the intel, we've got the zeitgeist, we've got the pulse.
[03:09:37.570 --> 03:09:38.930]  They know.
[03:09:38.930 --> 03:09:41.051]  And so, if they can get us, everybody else.
[03:09:41.051 --> 03:09:42.591]  And they're not bragging about that.
[03:09:42.591 --> 03:09:46.592]  So, the Democrats are like, we want the names of jurors so we can threaten them.
[03:09:46.592 --> 03:09:49.093]  In the Manafort case, they're unhinged.
[03:09:49.093 --> 03:09:50.493]  They're out of control.
[03:09:50.493 --> 03:09:53.754]  We need your steadfast, like a North Star support.
[03:09:53.754 --> 03:09:55.815]  That's why, whether you want coffee or supplements,
[03:09:57.145 --> 03:10:01.170]  You know, maybe you don't want to reorder heirloom seeds every month or every two months, three months.
[03:10:01.170 --> 03:10:03.813]  You choose one click in the store.
[03:10:03.813 --> 03:10:04.233]  That's fine.
[03:10:04.233 --> 03:10:09.639]  But coffee, super high quality, organic, high mountains, Chiapas, right by the Guatemalan border.
[03:10:09.639 --> 03:10:11.001]  I think it's the best coffee.
[03:10:11.001 --> 03:10:15.546]  It's very, very competitively priced.
[03:10:15.546 --> 03:10:17.689]  You sign up for auto ship, you get big discounts.
[03:10:19.875 --> 03:10:21.136]  10% on top of it.
[03:10:21.136 --> 03:10:25.541]  Sign up for AutoShip on Secret 12 or X2 and you lock in the price.
[03:10:25.541 --> 03:10:26.542]  Get a t-shirt.
[03:10:26.542 --> 03:10:26.962]  Whatever.
[03:10:26.962 --> 03:10:28.824]  We need your support.
[03:10:28.824 --> 03:10:30.025]  That's how you put skin in the game.
[03:10:30.731 --> 03:10:32.233]  Get a forbidden information.
[03:10:32.233 --> 03:10:34.495]  Infowars.com t-shirt, our newest.
[03:10:34.495 --> 03:10:35.416]  Won't be until next week.
[03:10:35.416 --> 03:10:37.198]  Get a meme like a wolverine.
[03:10:37.198 --> 03:10:43.345]  Alright, going back to Mike Adams who's taking over this hour, Mike, and just how dire the situation is.
[03:10:43.345 --> 03:10:48.832]  We have the power, we have the capacity, we have the ability to stop this, but people understand, this is not a game.
[03:10:48.832 --> 03:10:51.174]  The reason they're attacking Infowars is they realize
[03:10:52.130 --> 03:10:55.632]  That, and I'm not saying this on a power trip, I don't know why this is the case.
[03:10:55.632 --> 03:11:00.895]  They can track it back to our guests and our reports and our information, not me.
[03:11:00.895 --> 03:11:04.017]  I'm a small part of it, but I do have that spirit of resistance.
[03:11:04.017 --> 03:11:05.298]  That's the ignition point.
[03:11:05.298 --> 03:11:09.360]  But our guests and our crew is the main charge.
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:11.941]  I'm just the detonator, and our audience is the detonator.
[03:11:11.941 --> 03:11:15.483]  They keep going back to us as domino one, patient zero.
[03:11:15.483 --> 03:11:16.604]  And so they want to shut down.
[03:11:16.604 --> 03:11:19.266]  Well, then we have to say, what is it InfoWars is doing
[03:11:20.206 --> 03:11:43.631]  As you pointed out, that we're the interrupter, we're breaking into the transmission, where NPR's all, oh hi, America was never great, it'll never be great, lay down and die, we'll take, well no, I'm saying in a grating car wreck, you know, like no, wake up, get, wake up, wake up, I think, we're the cold bucket of water, Mike Adams, take over.
[03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:52.486]  Well, in exactly the same way that China cracks down on free speech there, you know, you cannot say that you're opposed to the Communist Party.
[03:11:52.486 --> 03:11:54.847]  You will be kidnapped, essentially, by the government.
[03:11:54.847 --> 03:11:56.008]  You'll be disappeared.
[03:11:56.008 --> 03:11:57.469]  You'll have your organs harvested.
[03:11:57.469 --> 03:11:59.731]  That's not an exaggeration.
[03:11:59.731 --> 03:12:00.892]  That's exactly what they do.
[03:12:00.892 --> 03:12:09.317]  And by the way, I want to mention on that, Senator Dianne Feinstein's office was infiltrated by a Chinese spy for 20 years.
[03:12:09.317 --> 03:12:10.899]  This is now well documented.
[03:12:12.455 --> 03:12:25.626]  We know now that when human rights activists went to Senator Feinstein's office to try to file complaints about the human rights abuses in China, Senator Feinstein's office took copies of their IDs.
[03:12:25.626 --> 03:12:30.450]  And we know then, because of the spy in her office, those IDs were sent back to Beijing.
[03:12:30.450 --> 03:12:37.375]  And then when those Chinese citizens would travel back to China, they would very often be kidnapped and disappeared.
[03:12:37.375 --> 03:12:38.236]  This is Senator...
[03:12:40.225 --> 03:12:40.665]  Thank you.
[03:12:54.837 --> 03:13:05.422]  And we have an investigation into Trump colluding with the Russians and no discussion about Senator Feinstein, her office, colluding with Communist China to murder human rights activists.
[03:13:05.422 --> 03:13:08.284]  What is wrong with this picture?
[03:13:08.284 --> 03:13:10.345]  Why aren't the real criminals in America being investigated?
[03:13:10.345 --> 03:13:15.167]  That's just a side note, Alex, because this is just, it's too insane what's going on.
[03:13:15.167 --> 03:13:19.089]  And if we continue down this path, America is going to become Communist China.
[03:13:20.580 --> 03:13:29.163]  What I want to cover here in this hour, and by the way, bring up Radio Free Asia, that's RFA.org, and there's a story there.
[03:13:29.163 --> 03:13:36.826]  It says Chinese activists who wrote, down with the Communist Party, in a toilet, disappears.
[03:13:36.826 --> 03:13:46.709]  He was in a hospital restroom, and the only free speech he's got left is to scribble on the walls that the Communist Party is destroying us all.
[03:13:47.626 --> 03:13:52.930]  And then, you know, he posted online about the toilet revolution, because that's the last place they can have free speech.
[03:13:52.930 --> 03:13:54.391]  And he disappears, too.
[03:13:54.391 --> 03:14:00.556]  Just like those human rights activists that try to go to Senator Feinstein's office to beg for help.
[03:14:00.556 --> 03:14:06.020]  Help us not be kidnapped and murdered and organ harvested by this communist Chinese regime.
[03:14:06.020 --> 03:14:06.881]  And what happens?
[03:14:06.881 --> 03:14:07.901]  They get murdered.
[03:14:07.901 --> 03:14:09.142]  They get kidnapped.
[03:14:09.142 --> 03:14:09.883]  Perhaps tortured.
[03:14:09.883 --> 03:14:12.145]  We don't know what happened to them all.
[03:14:12.145 --> 03:14:15.167]  But this activist, in the toilet revolution story,
[03:14:15.985 --> 03:14:19.328]  Says that, you know, look, China is poisoning us all.
[03:14:19.328 --> 03:14:21.230]  This is a Chinese citizen saying this.
[03:14:21.230 --> 03:14:23.432]  China is poisoning our food.
[03:14:23.432 --> 03:14:24.813]  Poisoning our water.
[03:14:24.813 --> 03:14:25.994]  Poisoning our vaccines.
[03:14:25.994 --> 03:14:29.077]  There's a massive vaccine scandal exploding in China right now.
[03:14:29.077 --> 03:14:31.339]  I'll cover it in more detail during this hour.
[03:14:31.339 --> 03:14:40.006]  A million doses of vaccines now tainted that have been distributed and injected into children all across China.
[03:14:40.006 --> 03:14:41.748]  We don't even know the extent of the damage yet.
[03:14:42.296 --> 03:14:48.619]  And the Communist Chinese government ordered a massive media blackout of that story.
[03:14:48.619 --> 03:14:50.739]  And that is exactly what the U.S.
[03:14:50.739 --> 03:14:52.480]  government does with the U.S.
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:53.601]  media as well.
[03:14:53.601 --> 03:15:05.525]  The CDC functions like a Communist military organization, sends out a demand to every media organization in America and says, don't cover the whistleblowers inside the CDC.
[03:15:05.525 --> 03:15:07.806]  Don't cover the truth about autism.
[03:15:07.806 --> 03:15:10.507]  Don't cover anything about the ingredients in vaccines.
[03:15:10.507 --> 03:15:11.928]  That's a reflection of Communist China.
[03:15:12.668 --> 03:15:14.650]  China's doing the exact same thing right now.
[03:15:14.650 --> 03:15:16.352]  It's a massive scandal.
[03:15:16.352 --> 03:15:21.256]  And when you try to talk about it, you get kidnapped by the government.
[03:15:21.256 --> 03:15:22.938]  You get shut down.
[03:15:22.938 --> 03:15:24.299]  Your organs are harvested.
[03:15:24.299 --> 03:15:30.445]  This is what happens when you have no free speech and when you let a tyrannical government regime take over.
[03:15:30.445 --> 03:15:32.527]  It's insane.
[03:15:32.527 --> 03:15:37.072]  We've got a lot more ahead, including some tech conversations about alternatives.
[03:15:37.762 --> 03:15:41.546]  To the techno-tyranny now dominating American online culture.
[03:15:41.546 --> 03:15:44.549]  We'll be right back here on the Alex Jones Show, so stay with us.
[03:15:44.549 --> 03:15:44.910]  We'll be back.
[03:15:53.567 --> 03:15:55.448]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:19:57.369 --> 03:19:59.979]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.017 --> 03:20:37.447]  Today in the fourth hour on the Alex Jones Show and by the way thank you for joining me this is Mike Adams here hosting this hour covering a lot of tech tech alternatives to the censorship platforms that are dominated by big tech that is now de-platforming virtually all voices of truth or voices that are pro-Trump or pro-America pro-liberty
[03:20:38.127 --> 03:20:38.688]  What have you?
[03:20:38.688 --> 03:20:43.330]  We're going to talk about and list a lot of alternatives, even alternative browsers.
[03:20:43.330 --> 03:20:51.095]  As I was researching this story, I found out that the Opera browser had been sold to China for $900 million.
[03:20:51.095 --> 03:20:54.597]  And that was actually almost two years ago, I believe.
[03:20:54.597 --> 03:20:55.978]  I was surprised.
[03:20:55.978 --> 03:20:58.740]  I had no idea that China had bought a browser.
[03:20:58.740 --> 03:21:00.381]  There's also another story out there.
[03:21:00.381 --> 03:21:05.204]  There's a new browser from China called RedCore.
[03:21:05.204 --> 03:21:06.925]  Yeah, like Kami RedCore.
[03:21:07.634 --> 03:21:21.377]  It's called RedCore and the creator of it claimed that they had finally broken free from Google and they had built their own Communist China browser from the ground up using commie code.
[03:21:21.377 --> 03:21:26.258]  And it's called RedCore, like I said, and then it turns out the whole thing is built on Google.
[03:21:26.258 --> 03:21:26.978]  It's on Chrome.
[03:21:26.978 --> 03:21:31.579]  It's basically Chrome rebranded to be RedCore.
[03:21:31.579 --> 03:21:32.719]  So if you go now
[03:21:34.722 --> 03:21:36.824]  And look at this RedCorp browser underneath you.
[03:21:36.824 --> 03:21:51.376]  If you open the hood underneath, it's all Google technology powering this communist browser that is going to block independent media or anybody talking about organ harvesting or Falun Gong or Tiananmen Square, you name it.
[03:21:51.376 --> 03:21:57.741]  If you just talk about Buddhist monks in China, you know, you can be shut down or blocked.
[03:21:57.741 --> 03:22:02.405]  And I've got a lot of notes here on these things and more, but first I want to go to another China scandal.
[03:22:03.519 --> 03:22:06.240]  Which is the exploding vaccine scandal now a million doses.
[03:22:06.240 --> 03:22:10.962]  This is a top story right now that we just posted on naturalnews.com.
[03:22:10.962 --> 03:22:19.725]  The vaccine scandal explodes as one million doses now found to be maiming children, and there's a total media cover-up.
[03:22:19.725 --> 03:22:24.467]  Look, the media in China has been ordered by the government there to blacklist this story.
[03:22:24.467 --> 03:22:26.008]  And at the same time,
[03:22:26.949 --> 03:22:34.394]  The company that's responsible for this was led by a woman, a very powerful woman, who was called the vaccine queen in China.
[03:22:34.394 --> 03:22:37.697]  She was one of the wealthiest people in the country.
[03:22:37.697 --> 03:22:38.637]  Imagine this.
[03:22:38.637 --> 03:22:44.041]  One of the wealthiest people in the country selling tainted vaccines to be injected into children.
[03:22:44.041 --> 03:22:55.169]  And don't forget that it wasn't too many years ago that there was that powdered milk scandal, where a powdered milk company in China was substituting powdered milk with melamine.
[03:22:55.928 --> 03:22:59.211]  And melamine was being sold and consumed by children all across the country.
[03:22:59.211 --> 03:23:05.676]  Well, melamine can kill you if you drink it, and it causes permanent kidney damage in hundreds of thousands of children.
[03:23:06.678 --> 03:23:08.859]  Had their kidneys permanently damaged.
[03:23:08.859 --> 03:23:17.061]  In some cases they were killed by melamine consumption because that company just wanted to make an extra buck because milk is expensive but melamine is cheap.
[03:23:17.061 --> 03:23:22.562]  So they just sold melamine as infant formula and the parents fed that to their babies.
[03:23:22.562 --> 03:23:31.525]  Another reason why breastfeeding actually is more advantageous than any of these artificial substances that claim to be infant formula.
[03:23:31.525 --> 03:23:35.366]  But the CEO of that company was charged
[03:23:36.098 --> 03:23:40.221]  And prosecuted and executed by the Chinese government.
[03:23:40.221 --> 03:23:41.522]  I mean executed.
[03:23:41.522 --> 03:23:50.168]  They killed that person and now it looks like this vaccine queen may be facing criminal charges herself or may have already been charged.
[03:23:50.168 --> 03:23:57.432]  The last I read she was already arrested and so it looks like possibly she might be facing execution.
[03:23:57.432 --> 03:23:57.733]  I mean
[03:23:58.906 --> 03:24:04.928]  Imagine the wealthiest, or one of the wealthiest people in the country facing execution for selling tainted vaccines.
[03:24:04.928 --> 03:24:10.430]  Now, contrast that to America, where you can sell the most toxic vaccines.
[03:24:10.430 --> 03:24:13.231]  You can sell vaccines with anything in them.
[03:24:13.231 --> 03:24:15.692]  They can have hidden cancer viruses in them, and they did.
[03:24:15.692 --> 03:24:25.756]  98 million Americans were injected with cancer viruses, simian virus, SV40 it's called, in the polio vaccinations throughout the 1960s and 70s and so on.
[03:24:25.756 --> 03:24:26.416]  98 million Americans.
[03:24:28.846 --> 03:24:32.867]  And when that came out, I mean, InfoWars covered that back in, I think, 2012.
[03:24:32.867 --> 03:24:34.487]  And we covered it as well.
[03:24:34.487 --> 03:24:44.810]  When that came out again, and we were talking about that, the CDC scrubbed that history from their website to try to memory hole that history.
[03:24:44.810 --> 03:24:48.231]  Because the CDC functions just like Communist China.
[03:24:48.231 --> 03:24:49.311]  They do the exact same things.
[03:24:49.311 --> 03:24:53.152]  They cover up the truth, and they do this relentlessly.
[03:24:53.152 --> 03:24:58.193]  They do not want the truth to come out about what's in vaccines, whether it's in China or America.
[03:24:59.295 --> 03:25:03.199]  Parents are correct to be skeptical about what's in those vaccines.
[03:25:03.199 --> 03:25:05.001]  Now, we've done stories at Natural News.
[03:25:05.001 --> 03:25:10.065]  We also have Vaccines.News, if you want to just go there and focus on vaccines, that talk about the ingredients.
[03:25:10.065 --> 03:25:15.651]  There are aborted human fetal tissue cells in many common vaccines.
[03:25:15.651 --> 03:25:18.874]  I'm talking, again, aborted human fetal cells.
[03:25:18.874 --> 03:25:22.317]  So the abortions that happen, the aborted
[03:25:23.846 --> 03:25:24.206]  Yes!
[03:25:24.206 --> 03:25:51.552]  I mean the tissue of once living unborn babies is sold off by Planned Parenthood or other abortion clinics to vaccine manufacturers who use that aborted fetal tissue to literally grow vats of diseased inoculated tissue that they spike with deadly viruses and then they use that, they use homogenization, they use UV light, denaturing of the viral proteins and so on
[03:25:52.282 --> 03:25:59.211]  And essentially they grind it up and they inject it, they put it back in the vaccine vials, and then it gets injected into other babies.
[03:25:59.211 --> 03:26:02.695]  This is medical cannibalism.
[03:26:02.695 --> 03:26:04.457]  And it's going on every day in America.
[03:26:04.457 --> 03:26:07.221]  And it's mostly black babies that are being aborted.
[03:26:08.121 --> 03:26:14.584]  And then you wonder, why does Black America question the vaccine industry about what they're injecting?
[03:26:14.584 --> 03:26:26.790]  And you know the cover-up that took place at the CDC involved black babies, mostly males, who had a much higher risk of autism because of what's in the vaccines.
[03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:31.212]  And that was covered up by the CDC, and there was a total media blackout all across America.
[03:26:31.212 --> 03:26:33.353]  Every media organization was ordered not to cover it.
[03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:36.011]  So think about these issues, folks.
[03:26:36.011 --> 03:26:54.700]  We're talking about an evil medical regime that's now backed up by a censorship regime where if you go on to Facebook or YouTube and you start talking about vaccines or anything that I'm talking about here, which is 100% true, you will be deplatformed, you will be censored.
[03:26:54.700 --> 03:27:03.384]  YouTube is now showing pop-ups over vaccine videos that try to indoctrinate you with propaganda and say, oh no, all vaccines are safe, everything's awesome.
[03:27:04.358 --> 03:27:14.244]  So if you have a truthful video that says, uh, I looked at the government statistics, and last year there were a lot of children killed by vaccines in America according to government statistics.
[03:27:14.244 --> 03:27:21.908]  And there were, you know, potentially thousands of children maimed, sent to the hospital, some in comas, seizures, neurological damage.
[03:27:21.908 --> 03:27:23.369]  It's government statistics!
[03:27:23.369 --> 03:27:29.152]  But if you say that, you are banned, you are deplatformed, you are censored, just like in communist China.
[03:27:29.853 --> 03:27:36.917]  I mean, what's it going to come to in America, where you have to go to a public restroom and scribble things on the wall now?
[03:27:36.917 --> 03:27:39.498]  You know, beware the ingredients in vaccines.
[03:27:39.498 --> 03:27:43.180]  Is that the last free speech you're going to have left?
[03:27:43.180 --> 03:27:44.761]  That's the issue that we're facing right now.
[03:27:44.761 --> 03:27:50.925]  So the vaccine issue just highlights all of this, this incredible government control and censorship.
[03:27:50.925 --> 03:27:52.646]  And that's why I bring that up.
[03:27:52.646 --> 03:27:58.449]  But as we continue this hour, I'm going to cover alternatives on platforms,
[03:27:59.367 --> 03:28:07.990]  Video platforms, browser platforms, social media platforms, and I have some good news for you, too, about something coming up that's going to be launched this month.
[03:28:07.990 --> 03:28:27.536]  Because if we don't have the right to express free speech, then we can never question these agendas and these cover-ups that are run by governments, even with industries like the vaccine industry, globally, or in collusion with the media that's been running this Russia hoax on Trump for, what, two and a half years now?
[03:28:28.405 --> 03:28:35.109]  And now they're trying to dox the jurors in the Manafort trial so they can, what, threaten them at their homes?
[03:28:35.109 --> 03:28:36.150]  And threaten their families?
[03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:38.852]  It's unreal what's going on here.
[03:28:38.852 --> 03:28:40.833]  But we'll cover it.
[03:28:40.833 --> 03:28:41.293]  We're here.
[03:28:41.293 --> 03:28:42.834]  We're fighting every day thanks to your support.
[03:28:42.834 --> 03:28:43.755]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:43.755 --> 03:28:44.855]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:44.855 --> 03:28:46.516]  Mike Adams filling in for the fourth hour.
[03:28:46.516 --> 03:28:47.377]  Stay with us.
[03:28:53.385 --> 03:28:56.846]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[03:28:56.846 --> 03:28:59.667]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:28:59.667 --> 03:29:01.568]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:01.568 --> 03:29:06.629]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:29:06.629 --> 03:29:09.910]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:16.172]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:29:16.172 --> 03:29:21.834]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work, and have a lifetime
[03:29:21.834 --> 03:29:25.096]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[03:29:25.096 --> 03:29:30.359]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[03:29:30.359 --> 03:29:33.101]  You can easily find Sunny Bay Heating Pads on Amazon.
[03:29:33.101 --> 03:29:34.902]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:54.258 --> 03:30:01.979]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:30:01.979 --> 03:30:02.440]  It's you!
[03:30:03.550 --> 03:30:05.731]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[03:30:05.731 --> 03:30:14.435]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:30:14.435 --> 03:30:19.037]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:30:19.037 --> 03:30:20.498]  You are the info war.
[03:30:20.498 --> 03:30:24.020]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:30:24.700 --> 03:30:36.088]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:30:36.088 --> 03:30:44.054]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:30:44.054 --> 03:30:50.639]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:30:51.099 --> 03:30:54.142]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[03:30:54.142 --> 03:31:04.571]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals.
[03:31:04.571 --> 03:31:06.253]  Please consider a contribution.
[03:31:07.434 --> 03:31:22.996]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:27.993]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:31:27.993 --> 03:31:33.216]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[03:31:33.216 --> 03:31:34.537]  And here's the best part.
[03:31:34.537 --> 03:31:36.358]  It is absolutely free.
[03:31:36.358 --> 03:31:41.582]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[03:31:41.582 --> 03:31:45.324]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:31:45.324 --> 03:31:47.386]  It's the InfoWars official app.
[03:31:47.386 --> 03:31:49.667]  Taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[03:31:49.667 --> 03:31:53.770]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:31:54.370 --> 03:31:55.731]  We knew it was coming.
[03:31:55.731 --> 03:31:57.172]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:31:57.172 --> 03:32:10.019]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:32:10.419 --> 03:32:21.465]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[03:32:21.465 --> 03:32:30.330]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:32:31.030 --> 03:32:40.474]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[03:32:40.474 --> 03:32:52.598]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info.
[03:32:52.598 --> 03:32:57.360]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:32:57.360 --> 03:32:59.981]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.242 --> 03:33:29.788]  Google's own staff is now protesting Google's effort to build a censorship search engine for China.
[03:33:29.788 --> 03:33:37.895]  Now, we know part of that is a joke because they've already built the technology and they're using it in America, and they use it even in the 2016 election, by the way.
[03:33:37.895 --> 03:33:44.101]  But now, the people who work for Google are just starting to wake up and realize, oh, hey, guess what?
[03:33:44.101 --> 03:33:46.623]  You're working for an evil corporation.
[03:33:47.367 --> 03:34:02.514]  That is supporting a truly evil regime engaged in human kidnapping, torturing political prisoners, harvesting organs, trying to spread the toxic communism plague all over the world.
[03:34:02.514 --> 03:34:04.295]  And that's who you're working for.
[03:34:04.295 --> 03:34:09.618]  So all of you who work for Google, if you work for YouTube, if you work for Facebook, in my view as well,
[03:34:10.265 --> 03:34:12.748]  You need to understand that you are working for evil.
[03:34:12.748 --> 03:34:19.856]  It's kind of like, you know, who poured the concrete for the Berlin Wall to keep the East Germans enslaved?
[03:34:19.856 --> 03:34:29.948]  If you poured the concrete or if you manned the walls, if you had the guns and you shot people trying to escape East Germany to get to freedom, you were working for evil.
[03:34:31.007 --> 03:34:43.893]  Well, now that Berlin Wall is a virtual online wall, and it's companies like Google that are now keeping people enslaved in a kind of East German online Stasi secret police regime.
[03:34:43.893 --> 03:34:51.057]  And if you're working for Google, you are directly lending your talents and time and effort to a truly evil regime.
[03:34:52.825 --> 03:34:58.470]  And part of that evil, of course, comes out of Communist China, which is most of the focus of my show today in terms of technology.
[03:34:58.470 --> 03:35:02.174]  I want to mention something else here that you may not have known.
[03:35:02.174 --> 03:35:03.435]  There's a fulfillment software.
[03:35:03.435 --> 03:35:13.124]  You know, you know how everybody's business infrastructure is now under attack by the left, even InfoWars, you know, Shopify payments, ban them.
[03:35:13.124 --> 03:35:17.348]  There have been other issues behind the scenes, you know, MailChimp and Disqus comment engine.
[03:35:17.987 --> 03:35:23.029]  There's a fulfillment software that is used not by InfoWars and not by us, but by others.
[03:35:23.029 --> 03:35:24.870]  It's called StoneEdge.
[03:35:24.870 --> 03:35:26.911]  And StoneEdge was purchased by China.
[03:35:26.911 --> 03:35:41.058]  And when China bought StoneEdge, they forced changes to the country addressing system inside the fulfillment software to make Taiwan designated as part of China.
[03:35:41.058 --> 03:35:45.280]  And this caused total havoc where everybody's sending out packages to Taiwan
[03:35:46.198 --> 03:35:51.442]  Those packages were now rerouted to China because of the way the U.S.
[03:35:51.442 --> 03:35:57.968]  Postal Service reads the country code and the way China forced the software to change that country code to China.
[03:35:57.968 --> 03:36:00.830]  This is exactly the kind of bullying that China is engaged in.
[03:36:00.830 --> 03:36:01.891]  They're doing it with airlines.
[03:36:01.891 --> 03:36:03.873]  They're doing it with hotels.
[03:36:03.873 --> 03:36:12.340]  They've forced global hotel chains to denounce Taiwan as a separate country and to claim that Taiwan is part of China.
[03:36:12.340 --> 03:36:13.421]  Now, just in case you're not familiar,
[03:36:14.139 --> 03:36:16.460]  I call Taiwan the Texas of Asia.
[03:36:16.460 --> 03:36:20.542]  Taiwan is a democratic, free country.
[03:36:20.542 --> 03:36:22.203]  That's where free speech is allowed.
[03:36:22.203 --> 03:36:25.965]  You know, Taiwan is a place where you've got free market capitalism.
[03:36:25.965 --> 03:36:26.625]  The Taiwan people.
[03:36:26.625 --> 03:36:29.147]  I mean, I lived in Taiwan for a couple of years.
[03:36:29.147 --> 03:36:32.428]  I know it very intimately, and the people there are amazing people.
[03:36:32.428 --> 03:36:35.550]  They're innovators, they're software developers, they're entrepreneurs.
[03:36:35.550 --> 03:36:37.051]  They're great people.
[03:36:37.051 --> 03:36:39.112]  But China wants to take over Taiwan.
[03:36:40.257 --> 03:36:41.658]  And they're planning to do it.
[03:36:41.658 --> 03:36:44.000]  And as part of that effort, they're running a PSYOP.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:45.101]  They convinced U.S.
[03:36:45.101 --> 03:36:54.287]  airlines to change all their maps and all their destinations to read that Taiwan was a province of China and not its own country.
[03:36:54.287 --> 03:37:03.413]  And China has been bullying other nations all around the world to cut ties with Taiwan or vote against Taiwan on diplomacy issues.
[03:37:03.413 --> 03:37:05.315]  And they're doing this to try to isolate Taiwan.
[03:37:06.283 --> 03:37:12.046]  And the reason that's relevant to InfoWars is because it's the same kind of bullying campaign that's being leveled against InfoWars.
[03:37:12.771 --> 03:37:14.612]  In fact, these are really in parallel.
[03:37:14.612 --> 03:37:19.076]  What China does to Taiwan, CNN is trying to do to InfoWars.
[03:37:19.076 --> 03:37:20.097]  It's the same thing.
[03:37:20.097 --> 03:37:37.250]  They're trying to isolate you, demonize you, get everybody to delist you and de-platform you so that they can then take over and you won't be a threat because you're reporting free speech issues or you're threatening the information monopoly or the political monopoly.
[03:37:37.250 --> 03:37:38.651]  So just think about that.
[03:37:38.651 --> 03:37:42.194]  When you think about InfoWars and the war on Alex Jones,
[03:37:42.774 --> 03:37:56.257]  I want you to also remember that Taiwan has been subjected to the exact same thing for many, many years, and they could be militarily invaded and attacked and taken over by China at any moment.
[03:37:56.257 --> 03:38:02.839]  And China's running bombers right now, bomb flight runs that look like they're targeting America, to bomb America.
[03:38:02.839 --> 03:38:03.379]  It's insane.
[03:38:03.379 --> 03:38:08.060]  But, you know, I love Taiwan.
[03:38:08.060 --> 03:38:09.901]  You should stand up for Taiwan's freedom.
[03:38:09.901 --> 03:38:10.661]  We all should.
[03:38:10.661 --> 03:38:11.301]  That's important.
[03:38:12.717 --> 03:38:17.293]  Moving on to other topics, let's talk about browsers for a second here.
[03:38:18.504 --> 03:38:24.166]  We reported the other day that Mozilla, Firefox, looks like it's going to start censoring independent media.
[03:38:24.166 --> 03:38:26.367]  This is a new escalation.
[03:38:26.367 --> 03:38:32.128]  It also underscores the complete hoax of the net neutrality push.
[03:38:32.128 --> 03:38:33.789]  I want to focus on this for a second.
[03:38:33.789 --> 03:38:43.092]  Remember net neutrality, where all these tech giants said, we have to pass net neutrality, or else you might be blocked from visiting the websites that you want to visit.
[03:38:43.092 --> 03:38:43.532]  Remember that?
[03:38:44.332 --> 03:38:53.100]  Remember that all these tech giants tried to get all the internet users to support them and say, yeah, we want freedom, freedom to access information, freedom to go to the websites we want.
[03:38:53.100 --> 03:38:58.024]  There were articles that said, oh, if you're gay, you might be blocked from visiting gay websites.
[03:38:58.024 --> 03:39:02.007]  Or if you're pro-abortion, you might be blocked from visiting abortion websites.
[03:39:02.007 --> 03:39:05.090]  We have to have net neutrality, right?
[03:39:05.090 --> 03:39:09.854]  Those same tech giants have now systematically deplatformed InfoWars.
[03:39:10.692 --> 03:39:14.595]  And also, National News, you know, the Health Ranger channel on YouTube.
[03:39:14.595 --> 03:39:22.721]  We were de-platformed in March of this year, proving that the entire net neutrality push was a massive con.
[03:39:22.721 --> 03:39:24.342]  It was a complete hoax.
[03:39:24.342 --> 03:39:26.224]  They're not interested in neutrality.
[03:39:26.224 --> 03:39:30.807]  They're not interested in people being able to visit the information sources that they want or the channels that they want.
[03:39:31.656 --> 03:39:34.159]  Net neutrality was another Trojan horse.
[03:39:34.159 --> 03:39:43.048]  It was a way for the government to come in and seize control of internet traffic so that when the Democrats one day get back into the White House, which they will eventually,
[03:39:43.840 --> 03:39:52.383]  They would be able to dominate the internet and control the traffic and de-platform at the TCP IP level.
[03:39:52.383 --> 03:39:58.446]  The basic level of web traffic, they would block conservative websites and independent media.
[03:39:58.446 --> 03:40:00.527]  That's what net neutrality was all about.
[03:40:00.527 --> 03:40:02.127]  It was all a hoax.
[03:40:02.127 --> 03:40:09.790]  And if you got wrapped up in that, it's time to look in the mirror and think about how easily you were brainwashed into supporting evil.
[03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:11.771]  Because that's what's happening all across America.
[03:40:12.785 --> 03:40:19.807]  You know, these left-wing people who work for Google, they work for YouTube, they work for Facebook, they themselves don't think that they're evil.
[03:40:19.807 --> 03:40:22.948]  Every day, they get up and tell themselves that they're doing good work.
[03:40:22.948 --> 03:40:24.889]  They're blocking hate speech, you know?
[03:40:24.889 --> 03:40:29.030]  They're helping progress, and they're tolerant, and they're inclusive.
[03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:39.334]  It's like these two bicyclists who said, there's no evil in the world, so let's go bicycling through ISIS-controlled territory in Tajikistan, or wherever they were, and they got stabbed to death.
[03:40:39.334 --> 03:40:39.734]  You know, it's like,
[03:40:40.214 --> 03:40:50.199]  These people tell themselves that there's no evil in the world as long as everybody's tolerant and inclusive, but they want to block you for hate speech while they're calling themselves tolerant.
[03:40:50.199 --> 03:40:55.162]  But they are carrying out incredible evil, even while they're telling themselves that they're good people.
[03:40:55.162 --> 03:40:56.362]  Just keep this in mind.
[03:40:56.362 --> 03:41:04.707]  This is something, if you ever try to debate with a left-wing person, you can't start out the debate by saying, first, acknowledge that you're evil.
[03:41:04.707 --> 03:41:07.368]  No, they're going to say, no, we're not evil, you're evil.
[03:41:08.092 --> 03:41:09.453]  But they're working for evil.
[03:41:09.453 --> 03:41:10.994]  They're building evil systems.
[03:41:10.994 --> 03:41:13.516]  They're building evil technology.
[03:41:13.516 --> 03:41:17.559]  Technology that deprives people of basic human rights and human dignity.
[03:41:17.559 --> 03:41:19.640]  That's exactly what is happening.
[03:41:19.640 --> 03:41:20.961]  That's the truth.
[03:41:20.961 --> 03:41:24.624]  Firefox and Mozilla looks like they're going to evil.
[03:41:24.624 --> 03:41:26.445]  So what are the alternatives?
[03:41:26.445 --> 03:41:28.846]  A couple browsers I want to mention here.
[03:41:28.846 --> 03:41:30.528]  Number one is Brave.
[03:41:30.528 --> 03:41:35.311]  The Brave browser was built by some people who are very much pro-liberty.
[03:41:35.311 --> 03:41:36.672]  At least that's my understanding.
[03:41:37.276 --> 03:41:40.600]  That's always subject to change if pressure is brought to bear on these companies.
[03:41:40.600 --> 03:41:43.603]  But Brave.com is a good browser to check out right now.
[03:41:43.603 --> 03:41:45.925]  There's another one that I recommend.
[03:41:45.925 --> 03:41:53.132]  It's called Vivaldi.com, I believe is the URL for that.
[03:41:53.132 --> 03:41:55.515]  And that's a small independent group that built that browser.
[03:41:55.515 --> 03:41:57.217]  That's been working great.
[03:41:57.217 --> 03:41:58.258]  And those are alternatives.
[03:41:58.258 --> 03:42:00.360]  Remember, Opera has been purchased by China.
[03:42:01.169 --> 03:42:08.597]  Chrome is now the key core, the core code for the red core browser that is the Communist China official browser.
[03:42:08.597 --> 03:42:19.508]  And Google is going to use the Chrome browser to block the independent media once this free speech attack escalates to the domain level, the browser level blocking.
[03:42:19.508 --> 03:42:20.228]  So that's coming.
[03:42:20.228 --> 03:42:23.312]  So don't use Firefox, don't use Chrome, don't use Opera.
[03:42:24.304 --> 03:42:26.005]  Evil, evil, evil.
[03:42:26.005 --> 03:42:29.188]  Go to Vivaldi or Brave or find another browser.
[03:42:29.188 --> 03:42:32.790]  We'll keep you updated with more as we research more alternatives.
[03:42:32.790 --> 03:42:39.695]  And when we come back, we're going to give you some alternatives to YouTube and Google News and many other online services.
[03:42:39.695 --> 03:42:40.596]  So stay with us.
[03:42:40.596 --> 03:42:42.618]  Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:42.618 --> 03:42:43.758]  We'll be back with much more.
[03:42:53.314 --> 03:42:57.437]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:42:57.437 --> 03:43:04.502]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:43:04.502 --> 03:43:09.325]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:43:09.325 --> 03:43:17.070]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide
[03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:22.232]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:43:39.657 --> 03:43:45.420]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:44:02.276 --> 03:44:13.106]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:44:13.106 --> 03:44:15.227]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:44:15.227 --> 03:44:19.231]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:19.231 --> 03:44:20.252]  And I want to thank everybody that has.
[03:44:20.672 --> 03:44:26.476]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[03:44:26.476 --> 03:44:28.858]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.

[03:44:34.301 --> 03:44:36.803]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:36.803 --> 03:44:45.989]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:44:45.989 --> 03:44:50.432]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:44:50.594 --> 03:44:50.811]  We're good.
[03:44:59.158 --> 03:45:01.519]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:45:58.223 --> 03:46:03.946]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:46:03.946 --> 03:46:11.809]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:46:11.809 --> 03:46:14.971]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:46:15.171 --> 03:46:20.435]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[03:46:32.244 --> 03:46:38.489]  It's powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract.
[03:46:38.489 --> 03:46:44.214]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[03:46:57.404 --> 03:47:00.046]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:05.506 --> 03:47:19.811]  Gotta keep them separated.
[03:47:19.811 --> 03:47:26.113]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:47:31.628 --> 03:47:34.595]  Elon Musk weeps.
[03:47:34.595 --> 03:47:36.379]  That's the headline on Breitbart right now.
[03:47:36.379 --> 03:47:40.087]  Elon Musk, he's crying over the fact that he had to work on his birthday.
[03:47:40.777 --> 03:47:42.018]  So let me get this straight.
[03:47:42.018 --> 03:47:53.925]  So this guy that had unlimited positive press, glowing, gushing positive press about him for, I don't know, a decade or more, suddenly is facing questions.
[03:47:53.925 --> 03:47:55.686]  And he's just breaking down.
[03:47:55.686 --> 03:47:56.887]  I mean, I feel sorry for the guy.
[03:47:56.887 --> 03:47:58.087]  He's breaking down.
[03:47:58.087 --> 03:47:58.868]  He's crying.
[03:47:58.868 --> 03:48:03.070]  The board of his company is correcting everything he says.
[03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:06.512]  He's having a massive musk meltdown right now.
[03:48:06.512 --> 03:48:08.073]  And it's just a reminder.
[03:48:08.073 --> 03:48:08.994]  I mean, look at the contrast.
[03:48:10.018 --> 03:48:17.964]  I mean, Alex Jones has been under intense attack, and many of us have, myself included, year after year after year!
[03:48:17.964 --> 03:48:20.166]  You know, and we're not breaking down in tears.
[03:48:20.166 --> 03:48:23.528]  We just get, you get tough, you know, it turns you into a warrior.
[03:48:23.528 --> 03:48:33.055]  I guess you either break down and cry and run to the corner of your room and bawl your eyes out, or you get tough and you say, you know what, we're fighting for something here that matters.
[03:48:33.055 --> 03:48:35.357]  So let's, let's hope Elon Musk can, um,
[03:48:36.209 --> 03:48:41.893]  Dry his eyes and come back and actually build something that doesn't have bumpers fall off.
[03:48:41.893 --> 03:48:45.175]  I mean, for God's sake, Elon, hold it together there for us.
[03:48:45.175 --> 03:48:47.596]  Now, moving on.
[03:48:47.596 --> 03:48:54.020]  By the way, I don't own any stock in Tesla and I don't have any shorts on Tesla either.
[03:48:54.020 --> 03:48:55.881]  I have nothing to do with Tesla.
[03:48:55.881 --> 03:48:57.942]  I'm just shocked at this guy's behavior.
[03:48:57.942 --> 03:48:58.763]  It's crazy.
[03:48:58.763 --> 03:49:05.127]  But let's get on to some tech alternatives here because there's some good news is I heard this from a source.
[03:49:05.842 --> 03:49:11.046]  That there is a major new social media platform being launched this month.
[03:49:11.046 --> 03:49:13.208]  That it is extremely well-funded.
[03:49:13.208 --> 03:49:16.390]  It's created with the help of veterans.
[03:49:16.390 --> 03:49:18.972]  It's going to be friendly to conservative voices.
[03:49:18.972 --> 03:49:20.674]  Friendly to firearms.
[03:49:20.674 --> 03:49:23.456]  It's going to compete with Facebook.
[03:49:23.456 --> 03:49:26.098]  And it should be launched before the end of this month.
[03:49:26.098 --> 03:49:28.019]  I don't have anything to do with that project.
[03:49:28.019 --> 03:49:30.301]  I don't have any... I'm not invested in it.
[03:49:30.301 --> 03:49:31.462]  I'm not part of the R&D team.
[03:49:31.462 --> 03:49:33.083]  I'm doing my own thing.
[03:49:33.083 --> 03:49:34.004]  Real.video.
[03:49:34.004 --> 03:49:35.145]  But this is something different.
[03:49:35.942 --> 03:49:37.703]  We don't know the name yet, but it's coming out.
[03:49:37.703 --> 03:49:41.286]  So alternative platforms are being built.
[03:49:41.286 --> 03:49:46.289]  And we need to support all these platforms and support their economic models.
[03:49:46.289 --> 03:49:51.672]  So it's not enough to just go there and watch the videos or use the chat boxes or what have you.
[03:49:51.672 --> 03:49:56.075]  Support these independent organizations in the same way that you support InfoWars.
[03:49:56.075 --> 03:50:00.998]  Your economic support drives the success of all of these platforms.
[03:50:00.998 --> 03:50:03.420]  So let me give you a list, a rundown of what we have here.
[03:50:04.210 --> 03:50:07.152]  So far, of course, you've got Gab.ai.
[03:50:07.152 --> 03:50:08.633]  Everybody knows about Gab.
[03:50:08.633 --> 03:50:13.596]  They're being censored at the app level by Google and Apple.
[03:50:13.596 --> 03:50:16.217]  And Gab is a great social media alternative.
[03:50:16.217 --> 03:50:31.546]  You've got Minds.com, which is kind of like a social media platform hybridized with a cryptocurrency component, where I think you get rewarded in some crypto coins for the popularity of your posts, if I understand that correctly.
[03:50:32.476 --> 03:50:41.869]  You've got my new platform, Reel.Video, which, by the way, yesterday has just achieved now serving 2.5 million video minutes per week.
[03:50:41.869 --> 03:50:43.832]  That's a new record!
[03:50:48.084 --> 03:50:51.826]  Maybe sometimes 15-20% growth every week now.
[03:50:51.826 --> 03:50:53.987]  And with your support, that will continue to grow.
[03:50:53.987 --> 03:50:56.348]  And by the way, we just had a really cool new channel join.
[03:50:56.348 --> 03:51:00.889]  It's called S-H-T-F Prepping 101, I believe.
[03:51:00.889 --> 03:51:13.955]  They uploaded over a hundred videos of, like, how to make your own body armor at home, how to make a rainwater collection system, how to grow food with hydroponics, how to defend off attackers if you don't have a gun.
[03:51:14.455 --> 03:51:16.377]  There's so many amazing videos.
[03:51:16.377 --> 03:51:20.101]  It's like how to make your own laundry detergent, how to make a penny can stove.
[03:51:20.101 --> 03:51:26.807]  There's all these how-to videos and somebody just said, hey, I'm just going to upload this whole library because this could be useful.
[03:51:26.807 --> 03:51:30.210]  So you can find that at Real.Video and that's what I love about the platform.
[03:51:30.210 --> 03:51:32.212]  There's really practical stuff.
[03:51:32.212 --> 03:51:33.694]  There's also a video site
[03:51:34.739 --> 03:51:36.800]  Put together by the Utah Gun Exchange.
[03:51:36.800 --> 03:51:41.484]  It's called UGE Tube or U-G-E Tube.
[03:51:41.484 --> 03:51:43.365]  UGE stands for Utah Gun Exchange.
[03:51:43.365 --> 03:51:48.588]  It's a pro-Second Amendment video community and InfoWars also uploads their videos there.
[03:51:48.588 --> 03:51:49.829]  I've talked to those guys.
[03:51:49.829 --> 03:51:51.710]  They're good guys.
[03:51:51.710 --> 03:51:56.613]  Their team also goes out and protests some of the anti-gun protesters.
[03:51:56.613 --> 03:51:57.534]  So these are the pro-gun
[03:51:57.534 --> 03:51:58.014]  We're good to go.
[03:52:23.484 --> 03:52:27.126]  Put your channel on every one of these platforms, because redundancy is great.
[03:52:27.126 --> 03:52:28.507]  We all want that.
[03:52:28.507 --> 03:52:30.828]  We don't want one dominant platform.
[03:52:30.828 --> 03:52:34.050]  We don't want any central authority that can censor your speech.
[03:52:34.050 --> 03:52:36.072]  I don't want to be your central authority.
[03:52:36.072 --> 03:52:39.794]  We don't want Minds.com to be a central authority.
[03:52:39.794 --> 03:52:41.595]  We don't want BitChute to be a central authority.
[03:52:41.595 --> 03:52:43.296]  We want massive decentralization.
[03:52:43.917 --> 03:52:50.822]  And the way that you help us achieve that is you post your content to all these different platforms, and you also visit and support these platforms.
[03:52:50.822 --> 03:52:56.006]  Every one of them has some kind of revenue model, ad revenue, or a crypto revenue model.
[03:52:56.006 --> 03:53:05.592]  Support those revenue models, take part in this, and all of us together, we will protect these platforms so that you can have access to this life-saving information.
[03:53:05.592 --> 03:53:12.257]  Can you imagine, you know, when the next big false flag comes, which seems imminent, I don't know what it's going to be,
[03:53:13.391 --> 03:53:23.819]  But we know that, for example, Hezbollah has all of these terrorist cells now planted all across America, ready to be activated at a moment's notice, like sleeper cells, right?
[03:53:23.819 --> 03:53:32.265]  The most obvious thing for these people to do is attack the power substations and have a coordinated nationwide grid-down scenario, right?
[03:53:32.265 --> 03:53:34.347]  That's kind of the obvious thing.
[03:53:34.347 --> 03:53:37.709]  All they need is some explosives and they can, frankly, carry that out.
[03:53:37.709 --> 03:53:40.812]  And I don't know how many of these sleeper cells there are, but can you imagine
[03:53:41.627 --> 03:53:56.843]  How much it would suck to be sitting there thinking, oh, like yesterday I could have downloaded all these videos of how to make my own body armor, or how to defend myself against attackers, or how to harden the doors of my house so people can't kick them in.
[03:53:56.843 --> 03:54:02.630]  But then now all of a sudden, you have no electricity, you're offline, the country's offline, you don't have access to any videos.
[03:54:02.630 --> 03:54:03.591]  So I say,
[03:54:04.151 --> 03:54:13.235]  Get on these websites, get this information now, download these videos now, download PDFs, how-to manuals, start saving your own home archive of all this information.
[03:54:13.235 --> 03:54:17.157]  I've downloaded, by the way, I downloaded this from YouTube, actually I had a staffer do it.
[03:54:17.157 --> 03:54:26.140]  We downloaded gun assembly and disassembly how-to videos, over a thousand of them, covering all the popular guns, and we have them on an optical drive.
[03:54:26.140 --> 03:54:26.841]  I mean,
[03:54:27.828 --> 03:54:28.428]  Why did I do that?
[03:54:28.428 --> 03:54:32.389]  Because YouTube's not going to be there forever in certain circumstances.
[03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.909]  All right.
[03:54:32.909 --> 03:54:35.410]  Other alternatives.
[03:54:35.410 --> 03:54:38.210]  An alternative to Google News is something that we built.
[03:54:38.210 --> 03:54:40.111]  It's called Censored.News.
[03:54:40.111 --> 03:54:41.391]  There are no ads on it.
[03:54:41.391 --> 03:54:47.032]  It features InfoWars headlines and natural news headlines and many, many other sites.
[03:54:47.032 --> 03:54:48.872]  I mean, I think it's a couple of dozen sites now.
[03:54:48.872 --> 03:54:50.693]  They're near real-time headlines.
[03:54:51.873 --> 03:54:56.175]  Mostly pro-Liberty, pro-Patriot headlines across the board.
[03:54:56.175 --> 03:55:00.416]  Censored.News, just make it your new alternative to Google News, and we update that.
[03:55:00.416 --> 03:55:01.576]  It's got Breitbart on it.
[03:55:01.576 --> 03:55:08.639]  It's got, I think, Zero Hedges on there, Gateway Pundit, SGT Reports, so many independent media organizations.
[03:55:08.639 --> 03:55:12.960]  In near real-time, you can get those headlines, and you can also view it on your mobile device.
[03:55:13.803 --> 03:55:22.874]  And then also if you want to search the independent media, for a couple years we've been running goodgopher.com as an independent media search engine.
[03:55:22.874 --> 03:55:31.385]  It's not a big search engine like Google, it doesn't search everything, but it searches all these independent media websites that we spider as part of censored.news.
[03:55:31.385 --> 03:55:32.406]  You just go to goodgopher.com
[03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:37.491]  And search for anything there, and you can search the independent media.
[03:55:37.491 --> 03:55:45.274]  Infowars is included in that search result, as well as Newswars, I believe, and other websites, and we're expanding it all the time.
[03:55:45.274 --> 03:55:55.159]  So, from Gabs, Minds, you know, Real Video, BitChute, Censored.News, all these platforms are alternatives, and I apologize if I've left anybody out of this.
[03:55:55.159 --> 03:55:59.141]  I'm trying to get a pretty comprehensive list here of alternatives where you can go.
[03:55:59.141 --> 03:56:01.262]  And we want to see more of these built.
[03:56:02.097 --> 03:56:04.079]  And I know Alex does as well.
[03:56:04.079 --> 03:56:12.745]  Alex doesn't want to be beholden to one platform or two platforms because that's an easy target for the establishment to try to discredit and take down or DDoS attacks.
[03:56:12.745 --> 03:56:19.951]  Because think about it, let's say BitChute is suffering a DDoS attack one day, well you can go over to Real.Video probably and find many of the same videos.
[03:56:19.951 --> 03:56:25.315]  Or if we're under DDoS at Real.Video and we're down, you can go over to BitChute and see the videos there.
[03:56:25.895 --> 03:56:30.018]  So, this decentralization structure is very healthy for society.
[03:56:30.018 --> 03:56:35.843]  And that's what I support, and I know that the other creators of these technology solutions also support that.
[03:56:35.843 --> 03:56:38.805]  And we all support InfoWars' right to free speech as well.
[03:56:38.805 --> 03:56:46.171]  So, these are good projects to support, and we're not built on Google Chrome code.
[03:56:46.171 --> 03:56:48.773]  You know, it's not like the Red Core China browser.
[03:56:48.773 --> 03:56:50.935]  You know, communists at your fingertips!
[03:56:50.935 --> 03:56:53.917]  You know, we don't use that technology.
[03:56:53.917 --> 03:56:55.178]  In fact, we don't track users.
[03:56:56.403 --> 03:56:57.243]  We don't spy on you.
[03:56:57.243 --> 03:56:58.404]  We don't use Google code.
[03:56:58.404 --> 03:57:01.225]  We don't have AdSense or AdWords or any of that garbage.
[03:57:01.225 --> 03:57:02.906]  None of that stuff.
[03:57:02.906 --> 03:57:05.047]  Our goal is to be 100% Google-free.
[03:57:05.047 --> 03:57:11.890]  I mean, there might be some tiny snippet somewhere that uses some JavaScript library somewhere, but we try to get rid of Google.
[03:57:11.890 --> 03:57:13.691]  It's almost impossible, but we try.
[03:57:13.691 --> 03:57:15.212]  And I think we've done a good job.
[03:57:15.212 --> 03:57:17.253]  But anyway, those are some solutions for you.
[03:57:17.253 --> 03:57:19.034]  I appreciate your watching today.
[03:57:19.034 --> 03:57:23.016]  This is Mike Adams here filling in for Alex on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
