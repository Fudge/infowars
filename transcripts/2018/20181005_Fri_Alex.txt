[00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.174]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:18.400]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.103]  We are 32 days out from this incredibly historic election.
[00:00:25.103 --> 00:00:28.365]  And just about 20 minutes ago, the Senate voted 51 to 49.
[00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:35.295]  Flake.
[00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:36.216]  Wasn't a flake.
[00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:39.699]  And voted to send it to a final vote.
[00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.484]  So did one other Democrat joining that establishment Republican.
[00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:56.873]  And so now, 30 hours roughly from now, about 5.45 tomorrow, Eastern Time, it will go to the full vote and InfoWars will be live.
[00:00:56.873 --> 00:01:00.516]  I'll be here starting at about 3 o'clock Central.
[00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:04.988]  Right through to the vote, right around four o'clock central.
[00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:06.809]  There obviously will be some major fireworks.
[00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:09.010]  We're going to have reporters on the ground.
[00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.134]  I'm just going to leave it at that in D.C.
[00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:19.218]  So look for live coverage from InfoWars tomorrow.
[00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:30.846]  But tomorrow's news today, barring a terror attack, we've already seen riots and attacks, barring a truck bomb, barring a mass shooting,
[00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:51.530]  You're going to see Kavanaugh confirmed along these lines, 51-49, and you won't even need the Vice President to come in and override a deadlock, a stalemate, a tie.
[00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.112]  This is a big deal.
[00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:58.315]  Trump has not failed at anything so far.
[00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:01.137]  He's had nothing but hard fought
[00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:09.734]  Success, and this will break their will to a great extent.
[00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:19.478]  That's why Soros groups have pledged that they're going to take direct action.
[00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:24.900]  That's a CIA term for violence.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.583]  They're going to take direct action in D.C., perhaps emergency campaign to stop Brett Kavanaugh.
[00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:38.979]  And they're the ones engaged in information warfare using black propaganda.
[00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.340]  That's the craft names of that.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.020]  It means deception, lies.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.701]  We use white propaganda, the truth.
[00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:48.661]  Propaganda just means your political views, promoting things you stand for, like the Second Amendment.
[00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:50.662]  I don't lie about the Second Amendment to promote it.
[00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:52.302]  I don't lie about free market to promote it.
[00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:53.802]  I don't lie about America to promote it.
[00:02:53.802 --> 00:02:55.183]  I don't lie about the show to promote it.
[00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:58.703]  The enemy though, they are in darkness.
[00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:00.764]  And now there's a bunch of new articles out today
[00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:09.600]  Saying that I am a terrorist.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.040]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.942]  The new headlines are that I am a information terrorist.
[00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:22.224]  And so now they've expanded on past that.
[00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:26.165]  In Wired Magazine.
[00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:26.485]  Look at this.
[00:03:27.668 --> 00:03:29.209]  I'm now a terrorist.
[00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.029]  Here's your headline.
[00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:36.532]  Brett Kavanaugh, the information terrorist, trying to reshape America.
[00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:43.775]  So now that they've silenced me on both of these platforms, they can move on to say I'm a terrorist and need to be arrested.
[00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:47.424]  Of course, you still got Tucker Carlson in mainstream news telling the truth.
[00:03:47.424 --> 00:03:48.165]  They're gunning for him.
[00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:50.887]  Never even got to this yesterday.
[00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:53.449]  Only time we're not tomorrow's news today is when I'm covering myself.
[00:03:53.449 --> 00:04:02.676]  I'm usually two, three days behind, you know, when Tim Cook attacks me or whatever, because I'm not focused on me, but I have to do it because we're in the center of the fight.
[00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:03.557]  Look at this.
[00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:05.318]  Free speech evaporating in this country.
[00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:13.965]  Tucker Carlson breaks down Google's censorship of InfoWars and internal documents they got saying that I'm the number one enemy.
[00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:25.701]  Project Veritas already got video of it, but why do you think vice presidents at Google are saying Alex Jones is the enemy and now these are even higher level documents?
[00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:28.984]  Why am I the enemy?
[00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:30.145]  Because I'm not insane?
[00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:37.291]  That's the only reason that I can't be bought.
[00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:41.715]  The Chai Coms are merging with Apple and Google and have put spy tech in everything
[00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:45.469]  For a foreign takeover and information warfare.
[00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:52.118]  And all you crazy people out there that hate my guts, that have sided with the shycoms, you're frickin' nuts!
[00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:54.762]  You are the biggest dumbasses I've ever seen, okay?
[00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:56.604]  You'll see who laughs last!
[00:04:56.604 --> 00:04:57.485]  You'll see!
[00:04:57.485 --> 00:04:57.726]  Watch!
[00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:02.898]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:08.489]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:22.605]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:31.110]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:39.317]  32 days, ladies and gentlemen, 32 days for the most historic election in world history.
[00:06:39.317 --> 00:06:45.082]  The referendum on nationalism and freedom versus globalism.
[00:06:45.082 --> 00:06:52.247]  And I think it's going to be a big, fat, juicy red wave, except we're up against a huge seawall of election fraud.
[00:06:52.247 --> 00:07:02.795]  So hold on to your seats and feel free to bite your fingernails, because this is a cliffhanger of cliffhangers with so much on the table.
[00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:13.385]  I got friends, family, love the Super Bowl, love the World Series, they get really excited about it, they get butterflies, they get upset, and I'm just sorry.
[00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:26.450]  Sports cannot compete with my family's future, your family's future, the Qaikom globalist ally with the unelected EU, trying to destroy our country, destroy our prosperity, and bring in world government and take our free speech.
[00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.591]  This is real warfare.
[00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:31.552]  This is 21st century, 6th generational warfare.
[00:07:36.158 --> 00:07:42.183]  We are 32 days out.
[00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:51.111]  And you notice everything that you only heard here about Chinese spy chips in the Google phones, dialing into everything in your house, stealing your data.
[00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:56.936]  No iPhone should be allowed within a mile of the Pentagon, within a mile of government facilities, literally.
[00:07:56.936 --> 00:08:01.881]  They have little receiver transmitters, transceivers.
[00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:27.830]  Can you notice, people thought I was like a space alien covering this last decade, that China's buying up Hollywood, China's buying up the debt, China's got traitors in our government, they plan a takeover, an industrial economic takeover, because the CFR was writing books every month about it, and publishing magazines about it, and drooling over it, and rubbing their hands together like villains do in criminology, not just in movies.
[00:08:28.732 --> 00:08:36.236]  Where the villain's got you hung up by your arms and brags how his evil plan's gonna work before he kills you.
[00:08:36.236 --> 00:08:38.257]  And that's what they did.
[00:08:38.257 --> 00:08:41.059]  And now their evil plan is out in the open, so we'll see what happens.
[00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:49.023]  But all the fools, when all this comes out, we're gonna remember who you are, that aided and abetted this, and you're going to pay.
[00:08:49.023 --> 00:08:57.968]  And then those of you that just tacitly supported it, you and your families are gonna be remembered as the traitorous scum you are.
[00:08:59.141 --> 00:09:00.802]  So keep laughing!
[00:09:00.802 --> 00:09:02.843]  Just keep laughing!
[00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:06.184]  You think I'm stupid going up against the system when the system's evil?
[00:09:06.184 --> 00:09:08.265]  And sold out to pure corruption?
[00:09:08.265 --> 00:09:12.867]  I call that sanity.
[00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:13.847]  Non-heroics.
[00:09:13.847 --> 00:09:16.308]  Now, we're not just 32 days out, obviously.
[00:09:16.308 --> 00:09:24.071]  Just about 30 minutes ago, to be precise, they passed in the Senate, 51 to 49,
[00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:49.888]  Along party lines with one Democrat voting to send it to a final vote tomorrow and barring some type of really big staged event or chicanery, that means they've got the votes and don't even need the tiebreaker of the Vice President, Mr. Pence.
[00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:53.251]  So this is quite a time to be alive right now.
[00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:58.864]  And the Democrats are announcing all these plans for violence, for attacks.
[00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:03.267]  300 plus of them got arrested for screaming and hitting and blocking things.
[00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:11.654]  Notice Marco Rubio walked out over to the cameras we had rolling and I said, hey, talk about censorship in America, not just in China.
[00:10:11.654 --> 00:10:15.036]  And he just starts, you know, being rude.
[00:10:15.036 --> 00:10:17.058]  So I got back in his face in a polite way.
[00:10:19.005 --> 00:10:25.389]  The media all called for me to be totally banned from the Capitol, banned from the Senate office buildings, and said, see how bad he is?
[00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:28.310]  Now Republicans see why we've banned him.
[00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.212]  I behaved on a scale of 1 to 10 like a 3.
[00:10:31.212 --> 00:10:37.195]  The Democrats are behaving like a 9 right now.
[00:10:37.195 --> 00:10:38.196]  I said, hey, I'm your friend.
[00:10:38.196 --> 00:10:40.237]  I appreciate you talking about China being a threat.
[00:10:40.237 --> 00:10:42.658]  Will you do something about censorship to conservatives?
[00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:44.119]  He's like, I don't know who you are.
[00:10:44.119 --> 00:10:45.160]  And I said, fine.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.240]  Will you just?
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.061]  I was very polite.
[00:10:48.885 --> 00:10:56.109]  You can pull up hundreds and hundreds of articles saying Jones assaults Rubio, Jones gets in his face, Jones interrupts a press conference, Jones interrupts him.
[00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:56.870]  No!
[00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.270]  I was there at the press conference.
[00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.691]  He came out a side door.
[00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:01.012]  They don't show the full footage.
[00:11:01.012 --> 00:11:02.273]  I walked over to him.
[00:11:02.273 --> 00:11:04.414]  Then the cameras came over.
[00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:07.215]  And then he ignored me.
[00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.237]  But the point is, I was there to get stuff done.
[00:11:09.237 --> 00:11:11.318]  I was there because they were talking about me in the hearings.
[00:11:12.708 --> 00:11:17.370]  I don't just show up at every one of these hearings like Amy Schumer and these Hollywood folks for no reason.
[00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.511]  I could show up there right now, it'd be a three ring circus.
[00:11:19.511 --> 00:11:21.052]  It might hurt Kavanaugh.
[00:11:21.052 --> 00:11:22.372]  I'm not there.
[00:11:22.372 --> 00:11:27.314]  See, because I sit back and I think about what's best for the country.
[00:11:27.314 --> 00:11:34.217]  And I need to go to that place in front of a hundred news cameras, literally that day, and talk about the censorship in America and put it front and center for the president.
[00:11:34.217 --> 00:11:39.480]  You think I think I'm going to win this lawsuit against PayPal?
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.841]  Let me just tell you right now, I don't think we are.
[00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:44.865]  We're on the right, but it doesn't matter.
[00:11:44.865 --> 00:11:50.928]  The lawsuit's been given to the President, and it details what's wrong and what we think the White House should do.
[00:11:50.928 --> 00:11:55.230]  And, believe me, you're going to see action on all of it.
[00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.152]  Because the NRA knows they're having their banking targeted as well.
[00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.353]  So, let me just tell you about something.
[00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.974]  You Democrats think one step.
[00:12:02.974 --> 00:12:04.995]  You don't even play checkers.
[00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:11.759]  I think beyond chess about what's right to do, and I'm willing to sacrifice my name, my blood, my treasure, everything,
[00:12:12.912 --> 00:12:14.773]  Because there's no future anyway if we don't do it.
[00:12:14.773 --> 00:12:17.234]  But they're always thinking, oh look, Jones is in trouble.
[00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:18.535]  Jones is being attacked.
[00:12:18.535 --> 00:12:20.696]  Yeah, that's what I intend to do.
[00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:22.877]  I intend to engage these people.
[00:12:22.877 --> 00:12:27.060]  Because I believe that we're gonna have some victories.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:36.025]  But even in my destruction, if that's what God wants, will be a spectacle to draw attention to what's happening and we will win.
[00:12:36.025 --> 00:12:39.967]  And that's why I was banned six weeks ago.
[00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.837]  From the internet in most areas.
[00:12:44.073 --> 00:12:47.776]  Was because I'm ringing the alarm.
[00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:57.584]  And if you've got a watchman on the parapet who's going to ring the alarm, you send up your operatives before your main invasion to grab them by the mouth and shove a knife into their spine.
[00:12:57.584 --> 00:12:58.505]  Or into their throat.
[00:12:58.505 --> 00:13:00.066]  Or into their kidneys.
[00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:02.008]  And so I've already gotten the alarm out though.
[00:13:02.008 --> 00:13:03.569]  I already blew the horn.
[00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:06.111]  I already rung the bell.
[00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:08.693]  And now they're stabbing the living hell out of me politically.
[00:13:08.693 --> 00:13:09.774]  But that's okay!
[00:13:09.774 --> 00:13:11.035]  Because guess what?
[00:13:11.035 --> 00:13:12.516]  I already raised the alarm.
[00:13:12.516 --> 00:13:13.377]  You, the audience.
[00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:16.099]  You raised the alarm.
[00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:16.659]  You're beautiful.
[00:13:16.659 --> 00:13:18.300]  You realize the victory we've had?
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.421]  Now, there's many other alarms that need to be raised, and I want to stay on the fight as long as possible.
[00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:24.601]  But let me tell you something.
[00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:31.003]  Politically, I'm like a fighter ace that's got a hundred airplanes on the side of my plane that I've shot down and defeated, thanks to your support.
[00:13:31.003 --> 00:13:32.564]  And you've done the same thing.
[00:13:32.564 --> 00:13:33.204]  So guess what?
[00:13:33.204 --> 00:13:34.844]  I get blown up in this fight, baby!
[00:13:34.844 --> 00:13:36.024]  I'm not a loser!
[00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:36.865]  I'm a winner!
[00:13:36.865 --> 00:13:41.546]  And I want people to understand that, because I don't want them, if they're successful in destroying Infowars,
[00:13:43.351 --> 00:13:50.373]  I don't want you... Guys, cue up the Vice President saying that Google better stop Operation Dragonfly.
[00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:52.834]  I'm here to defeat them.
[00:13:52.834 --> 00:13:54.995]  I'm here because I believe in you.
[00:13:54.995 --> 00:14:04.158]  So I don't want them turning it into a propaganda victory if they set me up or put me in prison or kill me or whatever because, you know, they're in full attack right now.
[00:14:04.158 --> 00:14:06.718]  This is a war, people!
[00:14:06.718 --> 00:14:07.399]  And you know what?
[00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:11.300]  If your granddaddy didn't come home from World War II, your dad
[00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:15.583]  Or your mom doesn't think Grandpa was a loser because he died.
[00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:16.625]  He was a hero.
[00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:17.767]  See that?
[00:14:17.767 --> 00:14:25.640]  You have to take it away from them that being demonized and attacked by enemies of good is a failure.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.661]  It's what you expect!
[00:14:27.858 --> 00:14:30.439]  And that's why I don't want callers to call in and say, oh, you're doing a great job.
[00:14:30.439 --> 00:14:31.019]  We love you.
[00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:31.499]  I love you.
[00:14:31.499 --> 00:14:32.540]  We already know that.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.800]  I'm doing the bare minimum.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.461]  I'm not facing prison like Tommy Robinson.
[00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:39.783]  I didn't get beat up and six of my ribs broken like Rand Paul or Congressman Scalise.
[00:14:39.783 --> 00:14:41.563]  They want to take us there.
[00:14:41.563 --> 00:14:45.545]  I'm doing what you're supposed to do when a bunch of authoritarians come down on you.
[00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:47.545]  So we'll get to the Democrats planning violence.
[00:14:47.545 --> 00:14:50.086]  If this vote passes, they're saying violence to block it.
[00:14:50.086 --> 00:14:53.128]  Soros is in full attack mode up on his hind legs.
[00:14:53.128 --> 00:14:56.109]  But let's go to the vice president warning Google.
[00:14:56.109 --> 00:14:56.449]  Here it is.
[00:14:57.236 --> 00:15:05.861]  As we gather here, a new consensus on China is rising across America.
[00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:19.009]  More business leaders are thinking beyond the next quarter, and thinking twice before diving in to the Chinese market if it means turning over their intellectual property or abetting Beijing's oppression.
[00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:21.670]  But more must follow suit.
[00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.211]  For example,
[00:15:23.314 --> 00:15:35.544]  Google should immediately end development of the Dragonfly app that will strengthen the Communist Party's censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers.
[00:15:35.544 --> 00:15:40.428]  There's a consensus rising, and you see, I got corrected last night by a very smart individual.
[00:15:40.428 --> 00:15:43.430]  They said, Jones, you're not the guy hitting the barbed wire.
[00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.772]  They said, we see you as the test pilot.
[00:15:46.784 --> 00:15:47.945]  We know.
[00:15:47.945 --> 00:15:49.287]  You already carry the consensus.
[00:15:49.287 --> 00:15:50.288]  We all know.
[00:15:50.288 --> 00:15:52.510]  You're willing to hit it and break the ice.
[00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.371]  Keep it up.
[00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:53.992]  Press the attack.
[00:15:53.992 --> 00:15:54.652]  You know what I said?
[00:15:54.652 --> 00:15:55.874]  I said, yes sir.
[00:15:59.853 --> 00:16:01.053]  Hear that?
[00:16:01.053 --> 00:16:06.435]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:09.336]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:12.917]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:20.499]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[00:16:29.798 --> 00:16:31.658]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:08.889]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:19:08.889 --> 00:19:10.371]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:10.371 --> 00:19:15.076]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:20.062]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:19:20.282 --> 00:19:40.448]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:44.952]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[00:20:03.467 --> 00:20:06.090]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.373 --> 00:20:34.375]  Oh, guess what's happening in Brazil?
[00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:38.237]  He was already in first place in most polls.
[00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.578]  Balassaro.
[00:20:39.578 --> 00:20:46.361]  But after he got stabbed and barely survived, he's leading by huge double-digit margins.
[00:20:46.361 --> 00:20:49.483]  Set to be the George Washington of Brazil.
[00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:51.384]  Second Amendment, everything.
[00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:53.585]  Oh my goodness.
[00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:57.527]  George Soros and the globalists are really, really, really scared right now.
[00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:01.743]  Let's continue here.
[00:21:01.743 --> 00:21:06.747]  You've got Trump even in skewed Gallup polls and others.
[00:21:06.747 --> 00:21:12.692]  Rasmussen, you name it, at 51 up from 45 just a few weeks ago.
[00:21:12.692 --> 00:21:17.196]  Yes, that's blown up in their face, the whole Kavanaugh witch hunt.
[00:21:17.196 --> 00:21:20.359]  And the added gravy of Soros-funded harpies.
[00:21:22.446 --> 00:21:31.510]  That no man would want to get within a thousand feet of, running around, screaming and yelling at everyone, saying, you're a rapist.
[00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.092]  They played the clip yesterday of Mitch McConnell in the airport, and they're screaming, rapist, rapist, rapist!
[00:21:36.092 --> 00:21:37.293]  See, now he's a rapist.
[00:21:37.293 --> 00:21:39.834]  Oh, and here's another article on drudgereport.com.
[00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:41.375]  Make them scared.
[00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:45.136]  Site post sex claims against male students that aren't true.
[00:21:45.136 --> 00:21:48.458]  Remember the New York Times last year?
[00:21:49.878 --> 00:21:52.961]  Had a couple of op-eds saying, it's time to lie.
[00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:59.666]  Of course, they'd always lied, but they were saying, oh, Trump's so bad, let's all lie!
[00:21:59.666 --> 00:22:02.669]  Yay!
[00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:06.051]  As if you weren't lying before calling all conservatives Nazis.
[00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:11.136]  Some failed idiot ideology that destroyed Europe.
[00:22:11.136 --> 00:22:13.838]  It's like saying I'm in the Tooth Fairy Union or something.
[00:22:15.862 --> 00:22:19.065]  I'm in the Americana prosperity and freedom movement.
[00:22:19.065 --> 00:22:19.886]  That's what I want.
[00:22:19.886 --> 00:22:25.131]  I want you to be free and smart and empowered because I don't want a bunch of losers around me.
[00:22:25.131 --> 00:22:29.195]  I'm not a globalist that wants a bunch of losers so I feel bigger than you.
[00:22:29.195 --> 00:22:32.459]  See, seeing you not doing well makes me feel bad.
[00:22:32.459 --> 00:22:34.220]  It bums my high.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.383]  I'm high on life.
[00:22:36.383 --> 00:22:38.705]  So, Trump's on the same bandwidth.
[00:22:40.253 --> 00:22:41.735]  He's on the same frequency.
[00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:47.505]  And now you've got Kelly Paul coming out and saying, listen, Cory Booker, stop calling for people to cost folks.
[00:22:47.505 --> 00:22:50.790]  My husband had six ribs broken, his lung punctured, Scalise got shot.
[00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.193]  We have been terrorized.
[00:22:52.193 --> 00:22:53.254]  We have lived in fear.
[00:22:53.254 --> 00:22:54.576]  I sleep with a gun.
[00:22:57.213 --> 00:22:58.134]  By my bedside.
[00:22:58.134 --> 00:23:04.198]  And what did I say a month ago when Twitter lied and said we're suspending Jones for calling for violence against the media?
[00:23:04.198 --> 00:23:12.024]  I said, if you're a member of Congress or their family being doxxed by Antifa or ICE, they're calling for coming to your house and killing you.
[00:23:12.024 --> 00:23:13.225]  Since then it's been all over the news.
[00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:18.029]  But then they were, we had PIs and other groups giving us intel on what they were planning.
[00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.130]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.552]  And you get next month's news today.
[00:23:21.552 --> 00:23:23.573]  They were calling for violence then too publicly, but nothing like now.
[00:23:23.573 --> 00:23:25.775]  It's just exponential on the Richter scale.
[00:23:27.093 --> 00:23:29.155]  Parabolic.
[00:23:29.155 --> 00:23:34.078]  And they said, oh no, Jones wants to kill reporters with battle rifles, but never showed the clip.
[00:23:34.078 --> 00:23:37.521]  And I go back to that a lot because of this.
[00:23:37.521 --> 00:23:52.091]  Think of the corruption and the evil to have every major broadcast, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, in unison say, Jones says, go out and kill reporters, when it's their people calling for violence.
[00:23:52.091 --> 00:23:55.394]  And I said, you better have a battle rifle next to your bed.
[00:23:58.732 --> 00:24:06.455]  Because if Antifa comes to your house with shotguns or with rifles, you don't want a handgun.
[00:24:06.455 --> 00:24:12.638]  You need to be able to have a riot shotgun, 15, 18 round shotgun.
[00:24:12.638 --> 00:24:13.738]  That's what I personally got.
[00:24:13.738 --> 00:24:16.300]  It's in an instant access safe right there.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.180]  Bam!
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.581]  Riot shotgun, baby.
[00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:24.083]  And then just get ready to go to Valhalla or wherever it is you rats go, you come to my house.
[00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.711]  You know why I got the shotgun?
[00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:31.693]  So I don't kill people through the walls.
[00:24:31.693 --> 00:24:33.895]  Those idiots have all got AK-47s and 223s.
[00:24:33.895 --> 00:24:35.736]  That's not good for houses.
[00:24:35.736 --> 00:24:37.717]  I guess they don't care about kids.
[00:24:37.717 --> 00:24:39.859]  The point is, obviously, that's who they target.
[00:24:41.227 --> 00:24:44.428]  I said, you better have your rifles by your beds!
[00:24:44.428 --> 00:25:05.094]  And it was so true, and it was a warning to Congress and to federal officers to protect yourselves, that's why they took me off, because it was the truth, and it was compelling, and I showed clips of 15 or 16 different people outside the White House saying, we're going to kill the Republicans, we're coming to your houses to kill you!
[00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:13.871]  I showed Antifa saying we're going to come and we're going to kill you!
[00:25:13.871 --> 00:25:17.334]  And now what does Senator Paul's wife say?
[00:25:17.334 --> 00:25:18.835]  They say they're coming to kill me.
[00:25:18.835 --> 00:25:20.957]  They already tried to kill Scalise.
[00:25:20.957 --> 00:25:22.358]  They call us and death threat us.
[00:25:22.358 --> 00:25:24.160]  I sleep with a gun beside me.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.441]  This is out of control.
[00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:29.324]  Democrats, stop calling for violence!
[00:25:29.324 --> 00:25:30.025]  And how do they respond?
[00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:37.903]  They respond with more calls for violence.
[00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:40.145]  All I said is what's common sense.
[00:25:40.145 --> 00:25:49.275]  And if you don't have... They've got affordable shotguns that hold 12 shells now.
[00:25:51.158 --> 00:25:55.320]  If you don't have that by your bed, you are insane.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.680]  Because they will hit at night.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.282]  And believe me, they have got not just the meth heads you see, that's the decoys.
[00:26:01.282 --> 00:26:03.323]  They've got real terror groups.
[00:26:03.323 --> 00:26:08.725]  Hezbollah and MS-13 work for the Democrats and the Deep State as auxiliary killers.
[00:26:08.725 --> 00:26:15.248]  It's a breakaway group of leftists in the CIA, just like they used the mafia in the invasion of Sicily and then Italy in World War II.
[00:26:15.248 --> 00:26:18.309]  They use these subgroups, the trash of the planet Earth,
[00:26:19.358 --> 00:26:20.539]  Is who's really going to be coming.
[00:26:20.539 --> 00:26:22.239]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:23.900]  MS-13 is going to target Congress.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.822]  So the Democrats call them God's children and defend them.
[00:26:27.822 --> 00:26:31.304]  MS-13, MS-13 have already been given their hit list.
[00:26:31.304 --> 00:26:34.025]  And who else did I just tell you have been given their hit list?
[00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:35.666]  Hezbollah.
[00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:40.448]  Obama made a deal and Hezbollah has real sleeper cells, not like Al Qaeda.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:59.453]  Hezbollah is the military of Iran and the Democrats are so insane they've allowed the infiltration and exfiltration back and forth of Iranian National Guard operating in Hezbollah networks in every city with a list
[00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:05.175]  Each Hezbollah member has a list of at least three houses they're supposed to hit.
[00:27:05.175 --> 00:27:06.956]  I'm going to release all this right now.
[00:27:06.956 --> 00:27:08.818]  Even most of the FBI doesn't know this.
[00:27:08.818 --> 00:27:11.259]  But 32 days out, I'm going to let you know.
[00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:15.883]  They have warmed up ready, MS-13 and Hezbollah, for you and your family.
[00:27:15.883 --> 00:27:23.029]  If you're a governor, a state legislator, a conservative pastor, I'm telling you, I have to raise the alarm now.
[00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:24.470]  This is why they're trying to shut me down.
[00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:25.711]  That you have to be ready.
[00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:29.294]  Notice what they banned me for, and they had to lie about it, was the warning.
[00:27:31.437 --> 00:27:39.967]  And now, Soros-funded MoveOn.org threatens direct action in D.C., preps emergency campaign to stop Brett Kavanaugh.
[00:27:41.274 --> 00:27:45.657]  They say they're going to shut things down, they're going to get violent, and Antifa is all over Twitter.
[00:27:45.657 --> 00:27:47.019]  They're allowed to go on there.
[00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:50.782]  Jack Dorsey lets them go on and say, we're coming to your house to kill you.
[00:27:50.782 --> 00:27:51.902]  We're going to kill the president.
[00:27:51.902 --> 00:27:53.344]  We're going to kill the vice president.
[00:27:53.344 --> 00:27:55.405]  We're going to kill this hit list of vice members.
[00:27:55.405 --> 00:27:57.247]  We're going to kill all these members of Congress.
[00:27:57.247 --> 00:27:59.348]  We're going to kill the conservative Supreme Court.
[00:27:59.348 --> 00:28:00.970]  We're going to kill talk show host.
[00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.471]  We're going to kill Sean Hannity.
[00:28:02.471 --> 00:28:03.752]  We're going to kill Mike Levin.
[00:28:03.752 --> 00:28:06.634]  We're going to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[00:28:06.634 --> 00:28:07.975]  Won't even say who else's names they say.
[00:28:07.975 --> 00:28:08.696]  You can probably imagine.
[00:28:11.181 --> 00:28:14.784]  There's legal reasons I don't.
[00:28:14.784 --> 00:28:21.108]  And if you don't think they don't want to kill you, remember Larry Grathwald, Green Beret.
[00:28:21.108 --> 00:28:23.330]  They tried to recruit him into Weather Underground.
[00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.851]  He got into the highest levels.
[00:28:24.851 --> 00:28:26.992]  They would sit around and talk about all these plans in the 70s.
[00:28:26.992 --> 00:28:33.877]  Well, now they had Obama in charge for eight years and they got the whole thing, a stay behind networks in place.
[00:28:33.877 --> 00:28:37.280]  And look, a lot of them have been rolled up.
[00:28:39.085 --> 00:28:46.193]  I can tell you that because they know it now, so I can tell you, I know from high-level sources, a lot of these people fell down and hit their heads lately.
[00:28:46.193 --> 00:28:48.355]  That's another reason the Democrats are so scared.
[00:28:48.355 --> 00:28:55.644]  You know, MS-13 and the Hezbollah groups and then some of the other hit groups the Democrats had hired, they all got scared and blew the whistle.
[00:28:55.644 --> 00:28:58.247]  Those that didn't, they're sleeping.
[00:28:59.369 --> 00:29:02.011]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:03.131]  Get back to nature.

[00:30:20.243 --> 00:30:22.365]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[00:32:00.014 --> 00:32:03.915]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:13.962]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:32:13.962 --> 00:32:15.923]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:32:15.923 --> 00:32:19.384]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:32:19.384 --> 00:32:22.025]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:32:22.025 --> 00:32:24.306]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:32:24.306 --> 00:32:31.249]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[00:32:31.809 --> 00:32:41.596]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:32:41.596 --> 00:32:42.777]  We'll win.
[00:32:42.777 --> 00:32:45.699]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:51.002]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[00:32:51.002 --> 00:32:52.843]  And you're right, to the market.
[00:32:52.843 --> 00:32:56.526]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[00:32:56.526 --> 00:32:58.087]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:32:58.087 --> 00:32:58.948]  We need your support.
[00:32:58.948 --> 00:32:59.508]  I'm counting on you.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:14.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.772 --> 00:33:19.857]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.023 --> 00:33:37.584]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:37.584 --> 00:33:46.586]  By the way, the things I covered earlier, I've mentioned a little bit before, and Soros' group, Media Matters, you know, said, oh, how ridiculous.
[00:33:46.586 --> 00:33:50.727]  Jones claims that the Democrats are working with MS-13.
[00:33:50.727 --> 00:33:55.489]  The Democrats, one trillion percent.
[00:33:56.451 --> 00:34:01.915]  Have been caught all over the Southwest working with the coyote smugglers, with drug gangs, you name it.
[00:34:01.915 --> 00:34:03.656]  I mean, what do you think Democrats do?
[00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.077]  Give me a break and grow up.
[00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:17.945]  And that's why they've been protecting MS-13 and saying they're God's children and say, how dare Trump talk bad about MS-13, who mainly targets Hispanics and kills people in satanic sacrifices to take their energy.
[00:34:17.945 --> 00:34:20.427]  Now, if you're a new listener, you think that sounds insane.
[00:34:20.427 --> 00:34:23.009]  Just type in MS-13 conducts ritual murders.
[00:34:23.908 --> 00:34:28.791]  And then you can read about it, how they believe satanic power from it.
[00:34:28.791 --> 00:34:30.752]  And the younger the better.
[00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:36.116]  And then the thousands of men in camouflage, many of them armed on horseback, coming across the country.
[00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:39.218]  This is globalism collapsing nation states.
[00:34:39.218 --> 00:34:41.139]  This is the assault we're under.
[00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:43.501]  This is their plan.
[00:34:43.501 --> 00:34:49.845]  And now it's come out, what we already told you years ago, that Apple is implanting wireless chips that break into everything,
[00:34:51.249 --> 00:34:53.731]  In your home, in your business, in the government.
[00:34:53.731 --> 00:35:06.381]  And then Google cars drive around with antennas and they scoop up the data and work with Google and work with Apple in tandem to data mine the information.
[00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:14.827]  And of course that's now come out in mainstream news that the AI project, as I told you months ago, in China with the Chinese military is not just Apple.
[00:35:14.827 --> 00:35:18.730]  Google is involved.
[00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:19.751]  And so is Facebook.
[00:35:20.936 --> 00:35:24.519]  And they're all doing it, and Tim Cook has bragged.
[00:35:24.519 --> 00:35:26.961]  That's why I call him the most evil man in the world.
[00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:28.983]  The most dangerous man in the world.
[00:35:28.983 --> 00:35:37.029]  Because he's a little non-assuming, non-threatening, you know, trendy engineer, who is in all these speeches saying, we want censorship.
[00:35:37.029 --> 00:35:41.233]  We want to make the world like China.
[00:35:41.233 --> 00:35:42.234]  We're going to curate
[00:35:43.759 --> 00:35:44.860]  Anybody we disagree with.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.862]  Oh that has five stars and a couple million downloads and their apps number one in news.
[00:35:49.862 --> 00:35:53.223]  So you're gonna take care of that and get rid of what's number one.
[00:35:53.223 --> 00:35:57.345]  And us in a contract paying to have the app placed, paying to have it approved.
[00:35:57.345 --> 00:35:59.505]  Already had dozens of other apps in my name.
[00:35:59.505 --> 00:36:01.306]  Three apps that we built over the years.
[00:36:01.306 --> 00:36:02.287]  This one was great.
[00:36:02.287 --> 00:36:03.027]  InfoWare's official.
[00:36:05.157 --> 00:36:08.738]  You delete it and then say, well, because, you know, it's just horrible, it's evil.
[00:36:08.738 --> 00:36:10.839]  Really, I don't run slave factories in China.
[00:36:10.839 --> 00:36:14.020]  I'm not aiding and abetting all this stuff, but see, you make me the bad guy.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.721]  So this full video is up on Infowars.com.
[00:36:16.721 --> 00:36:20.863]  You know all this, but Apple employees and Google employees don't.
[00:36:20.863 --> 00:36:22.163]  They're starting to wake up.
[00:36:22.163 --> 00:36:23.363]  The White House is awake.
[00:36:23.363 --> 00:36:24.504]  The Pentagon's really awake.
[00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.663]  And this is real modern espionage.
[00:36:27.663 --> 00:36:29.604]  This is real election meddling.
[00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:32.024]  This is real takedown of this country.
[00:36:32.024 --> 00:36:35.025]  And now the President's talking about it, and very close to action.
[00:36:35.025 --> 00:36:40.266]  And his issue is, he's calling these guys to the White House in a few weeks.
[00:36:40.266 --> 00:36:43.906]  Why not just start indicting these people?
[00:36:43.906 --> 00:36:47.347]  And don't think Trump won't do it, just because it hadn't been done before.
[00:36:47.347 --> 00:36:48.827]  It's outrageous!
[00:36:48.827 --> 00:36:51.127]  These people are crazy!
[00:36:51.127 --> 00:36:54.068]  They've gotten away with bloody murder, so that's why Cook thinks
[00:36:55.779 --> 00:36:58.700]  He's got a normalcy bias that he just thinks all this is normal.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.181]  He's going to get away with this forever.
[00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:01.321]  No, you're not, buddy!
[00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:02.661]  So it is a honor.
[00:37:02.661 --> 00:37:04.642]  I'm going to play it in a moment.
[00:37:04.642 --> 00:37:10.704]  It is a honor to be banned and to be attacked and to have him lead the charge to have me banned.
[00:37:10.704 --> 00:37:12.885]  Because that means I'm over the target.
[00:37:12.885 --> 00:37:14.846]  We got a bunch of special guests and a ton.
[00:37:14.846 --> 00:37:16.506]  Again, it's going to the full vote tomorrow.
[00:37:16.506 --> 00:37:17.606]  I think Kavanaugh is going to get in.
[00:37:17.606 --> 00:37:18.047]  It went 51-49.
[00:37:18.047 --> 00:37:20.407]  You're going to see the same party lines again.
[00:37:20.407 --> 00:37:23.068]  We have the vice president if we need it as a tiebreaker.
[00:37:23.068 --> 00:37:24.729]  That means we've got two extra votes right now.
[00:37:26.491 --> 00:37:27.692]  They're planning violence.
[00:37:27.692 --> 00:37:28.672]  They're pledging violence.
[00:37:28.672 --> 00:37:31.513]  Second hour, we're going to do that with Clyde Lewis coming up and more.
[00:37:31.513 --> 00:37:35.155]  But first, let's air part of this critical video.
[00:37:35.155 --> 00:37:37.156]  Tim Cook is the most dangerous man in the world.
[00:37:37.156 --> 00:37:38.776]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:37:38.776 --> 00:37:41.338]  We have been banned because of our criticism of this.
[00:37:41.338 --> 00:37:43.298]  This is the big issue.
[00:37:43.298 --> 00:37:50.121]  And this is what I need your help getting, taking the article at Infowars.com and posting it on your site and getting it out to everyone.
[00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:53.883]  Here it is.
[00:37:53.883 --> 00:37:55.364]  I'm here to do two different things.
[00:37:56.789 --> 00:38:03.371]  Number one, I have a message to Tim Cook, the head of Apple, the largest corporation in the world.
[00:38:03.371 --> 00:38:07.893]  And number two, I have a warning to the world.
[00:38:07.893 --> 00:38:23.219]  Under careful consideration in the last few years, I privately came to the understanding and analysis that Tim Cook is the most dangerous living person on this planet.
[00:38:23.219 --> 00:38:23.739]  Tim Cook
[00:38:25.433 --> 00:38:33.481]  is a clear and present danger to free societies and free peoples everywhere.
[00:38:33.481 --> 00:38:44.192]  I'm first going to give the world a very serious warning about Tim Cook and about Apple, and then I've got some words for Mr. Cook.
[00:38:44.192 --> 00:38:48.856]  Now, how did I come to the understanding that Tim Cook is such a classical tyrant?
[00:38:49.833 --> 00:38:56.462]  I came to an understanding from his own speeches and his own statements that I'm about to show you here in a moment.
[00:38:56.462 --> 00:39:01.148]  Both the articles and the video and where you can find it in context.
[00:39:01.148 --> 00:39:02.410]  So it was that realization.
[00:39:03.666 --> 00:39:22.207]  That Tim Cook and his cohorts are really seriously bad actors using leftist camouflage to carry out their operations that made me make the decision to really declare war on the authoritarianism of Apple and Google starting about three months ago.
[00:39:22.207 --> 00:39:24.009]  And within one month of that happening,
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:34.368]  Those groups worked in concert to basically cauterize InfoWars that they see as a disease from the rest of the internet.
[00:39:34.368 --> 00:39:37.111]  But in truth, we were simply trying to raise the alarm.
[00:39:38.616 --> 00:39:47.141]  So they're using Infowars as the straw man or as the first domino, the scapegoat, the test case to do this.
[00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:56.446]  But this affects every man, woman and child on this planet, not just people in China or the United States.
[00:39:56.446 --> 00:40:03.349]  Now let's first start looking at an interview he gave last weekend to Vice News.
[00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:05.731]  And then remember, I'm unable to go on YouTube
[00:40:06.795 --> 00:40:11.397]  Or these other platforms and even counter what's being said about me.
[00:40:11.397 --> 00:40:17.900]  So that's the next level of censorship where you are silenced so they can then lie about you and get away with it.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.422]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[00:40:20.422 --> 00:40:25.144]  What users want from us and what we've always provided them is a curated platform.
[00:40:26.365 --> 00:40:31.572]  We think that what the user wants is someone that does review these apps.
[00:40:31.572 --> 00:40:35.597]  Someone that does review the podcast.
[00:40:35.597 --> 00:40:41.885]  Someone that, on like Apple News, where a human is selecting the top stories.
[00:40:41.885 --> 00:40:42.686]  And that's what we do.
[00:40:43.905 --> 00:40:45.766]  We don't take a political stand.
[00:40:45.766 --> 00:40:48.087]  We're not leaning one way or the other.
[00:40:48.087 --> 00:40:53.309]  You can tell that from the stuff on the App Store and in podcasts, etc.
[00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:57.410]  You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
[00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.051]  And that's the way I think it should be.
[00:40:59.051 --> 00:41:01.612]  But at what point were you like, okay, that's it.
[00:41:01.612 --> 00:41:02.812]  Alex Jones has to go.
[00:41:02.812 --> 00:41:06.154]  You know, I don't want to get into a singular kind of event.
[00:41:06.154 --> 00:41:08.455]  But I think there's enough there.
[00:41:09.435 --> 00:41:16.940]  That reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate, that that should be all.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:32.790]  Now in a moment, I'm going to get to Cook publicly making statements, giving speeches, calling for governments to implement more censorship, and helping China carry out draconian controls against their oppressed people.
[00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:37.673]  But let's look at the million dollar word he used, curate.
[00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:46.968]  If you look at the definition, it means that an expert of knowledge decides what you will see, what you will eat, what you will smell, what you will do.
[00:41:46.968 --> 00:41:50.494]  A controlled virtual reality.
[00:41:50.494 --> 00:41:51.115]  A museum.
[00:41:52.594 --> 00:41:54.075]  So he's saying he's a curator.
[00:41:54.075 --> 00:41:58.276]  He's not censoring when he cuts somebody off from the marketplace.
[00:41:58.276 --> 00:41:58.876]  No, no, no.
[00:41:58.876 --> 00:42:03.858]  He's taking a bad apple out of the bunch to save the rest of the apples.
[00:42:03.858 --> 00:42:04.838]  That's what Hitler said.
[00:42:04.838 --> 00:42:18.343]  In fact, Hitler famously saw himself as an architect of society and as a curator and wanted to build a new Berlin, the capital of the world, that was a giant museum worshipping Nazism.
[00:42:18.343 --> 00:42:21.604]  And he saw himself and Albert Speer as the top.
[00:42:22.364 --> 00:42:23.926]  Curators.
[00:42:23.926 --> 00:42:27.910]  But we're not really talking about curation here, are we?
[00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:33.776]  We're talking about another C word, and that word is cauterize.
[00:42:33.776 --> 00:42:42.485]  When you believe that there's a disease in the body politic of globalism and Tim Cook's authoritarianism, where he's officially moved to China, we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:42:43.877 --> 00:42:53.292]  If you see someone as a disease, you cauterize it with a big, hot, burning metal object into the wound to kill the infection.
[00:42:53.292 --> 00:42:57.518]  We'll be right back, and liberty is the disease, individualism, you name it.
[00:42:57.518 --> 00:42:58.900]  How dare Cook say I'm the bad guy?
[00:42:59.403 --> 00:43:06.868]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.

[00:47:16.057 --> 00:47:24.163]  I know you loved me a long time ago.
[00:47:34.429 --> 00:47:51.442]  You still won't hear my love But darling this time Let your memories die When you hold me tonight
[00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:04.222]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here, 32 days out.
[00:48:04.222 --> 00:48:05.863]  You can just feel the energy.
[00:48:05.863 --> 00:48:13.670]  Evil is in major death throes.
[00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:18.975]  That doesn't mean that there's some perfect utopia and evil still won't be around, but we go through cycles.
[00:48:18.975 --> 00:48:20.257]  Everyone knows this.
[00:48:20.257 --> 00:48:24.541]  Historians, political scientists, we go through cycles.
[00:48:25.896 --> 00:48:32.958]  And we are in the bottom, hopefully, of the decadence and are going to start our way back up.
[00:48:32.958 --> 00:48:42.200]  And the globalists are trying to suppress that hunger worldwide for freedom and for justice.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.880]  But the spirit's rising.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:50.082]  Now, I'm not going to get to this full video report because I've got so much to get to and a bunch of special guests, but it's mooey important.
[00:48:51.431 --> 00:49:01.474]  If you're a listener and you're like, wow, Alex Jones, you know, talking about spy chips and the Apple phones and China and Google and AI and working with China, but not the U.S.
[00:49:01.474 --> 00:49:06.255]  government and all the censorship and Tim Cook promoting censorship.
[00:49:06.255 --> 00:49:10.336]  And now the president and vice president are talking about how it's all really China.
[00:49:10.336 --> 00:49:16.838]  Now the Democrats are in bed with the Chai comms because it's the truth.
[00:49:16.838 --> 00:49:20.519]  But if you cover it, Michael Savage four years ago wrote a book.
[00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:23.993]  About China taking over the U.S.
[00:49:23.993 --> 00:49:29.416]  China didn't find out until it was about to ship to the stores.
[00:49:29.416 --> 00:49:31.357]  And no one would take the book.
[00:49:31.357 --> 00:49:33.459]  Now see, most people shut up when that happens.
[00:49:33.459 --> 00:49:35.420]  Michael Savage didn't shut up.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.741]  I don't shut up either.
[00:49:36.741 --> 00:49:38.282]  And again, it's not because I'm some hero.
[00:49:38.282 --> 00:49:42.545]  I'm not gonna sit here and have the chi-coms take control of what I do.
[00:49:42.545 --> 00:49:45.567]  You try to shut me up, I know that's where I gotta go.
[00:49:48.626 --> 00:49:54.408]  So I'll play a few more minutes of this, and I think it's really powerful at the end, but it's got all the documents, all the articles, all the proof, all the video clips.
[00:49:54.408 --> 00:50:10.315]  Just get this article out, Alex Jones, Tim Cook's the most dangerous living person on the planet, because I've got a stack of news here where Google and Apple engineers, you name it, are coming out and saying, we're leaving the company, they're evil, they're doing stuff far worse than you know, they were waiting for our leadership.
[00:50:12.222 --> 00:50:12.903]  Your leadership.
[00:50:12.903 --> 00:50:13.783]  So call Congress.
[00:50:13.783 --> 00:50:14.404]  Call the White House.
[00:50:14.404 --> 00:50:15.505]  Call Talk Radio.
[00:50:15.505 --> 00:50:16.686]  Get the buzz going.
[00:50:16.686 --> 00:50:19.008]  It's the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek.
[00:50:19.008 --> 00:50:20.009]  That they got spy chips.
[00:50:20.009 --> 00:50:24.352]  They got the lawsuits against Apple for this.
[00:50:24.352 --> 00:50:26.174]  As patriots, we don't go looking for trouble.
[00:50:26.174 --> 00:50:29.837]  But listen, Big Dog's gotta get off the porch here.
[00:50:29.837 --> 00:50:32.419]  Or Tim Cook's gonna steal your birthright.
[00:50:32.419 --> 00:50:38.224]  I don't care what Tim Cook does to me, as long as at the end of the day, that little piece of crap knows he messed with the wrong people.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.402]  We gotta protect our children and our future from people like him.
[00:50:42.402 --> 00:50:44.684]  And we're gonna do it.
[00:50:44.684 --> 00:50:46.725]  Everybody else just better get out of the way.
[00:50:46.725 --> 00:50:47.466]  Here's the deal.
[00:50:47.466 --> 00:50:48.607]  We've got the will.
[00:50:48.607 --> 00:50:49.807]  We've got the birthright.
[00:50:49.807 --> 00:50:50.868]  We've got the strength.
[00:50:50.868 --> 00:50:52.389]  We don't need to run anything.
[00:50:52.389 --> 00:50:53.110]  We already got it.
[00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:59.153]  But good people forget that when you stand down, it only lets the evil run things.
[00:50:59.153 --> 00:51:04.576]  So I'm telling good men and women of every race, color, and creed, if you love God, you love justice, you got God.
[00:51:04.576 --> 00:51:05.717]  You got the birthright.
[00:51:05.717 --> 00:51:10.980]  So stand up, and stop acting like they run the show, and stop letting them guilt you into bowing down.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:14.223]  They don't have a conscience.
[00:51:14.223 --> 00:51:17.625]  They know you've got a conscience, and they're trying to program that conscience.
[00:51:17.625 --> 00:51:19.266]  So become aware of that.
[00:51:19.266 --> 00:51:23.909]  How dare them tell you you're a bad person when you're not, and they know full well they're consciously evil.
[00:51:25.555 --> 00:51:28.678]  Stop caring what they say and do the opposite.
[00:51:28.678 --> 00:51:29.479]  Get in their face.
[00:51:29.479 --> 00:51:33.282]  You think I care when they have some event calling for my censorship?
[00:51:33.282 --> 00:51:38.427]  Called the fake news of, you know, Alex Jones and Donald Trump and their rhetoric and how to shut them down.
[00:51:38.427 --> 00:51:43.291]  And I march into the middle of that and a couple hundred people are booing and hissing and spitting on me.
[00:51:43.291 --> 00:51:47.735]  You think I care what a bunch of brainwashed slaves think?
[00:51:47.735 --> 00:51:50.658]  They look like a bunch of escaped people out of a mental institution.
[00:51:50.658 --> 00:51:51.979]  I felt sorry for them actually.
[00:51:55.179 --> 00:52:00.901]  You think I care those cowards put those little, you know what, eating grins on their faces like they're confident?
[00:52:00.901 --> 00:52:02.402]  They're not confident!
[00:52:02.402 --> 00:52:05.423]  They're the bottom of the barrel!
[00:52:05.423 --> 00:52:08.784]  They're the devil's rejects!
[00:52:08.784 --> 00:52:11.545]  They come from bad people!
[00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:13.526]  But you know what?
[00:52:13.526 --> 00:52:16.287]  They think if they suppress us, they'll finally be somebody.
[00:52:17.642 --> 00:52:22.344]  And if you let them run your life, and if you let them control your life, you deserve what they do to you.
[00:52:22.344 --> 00:52:24.625]  You know, I'm not going to get into the rest of the Cook thing.
[00:52:24.625 --> 00:52:26.206]  It's a very important video.
[00:52:26.206 --> 00:52:28.347]  I haven't gotten to all the clips and things that are in it yet.
[00:52:28.347 --> 00:52:30.748]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:52:30.748 --> 00:52:36.311]  David Knight played it earlier with his great transmission, 8am to 11am, and I'll get to more of it later.
[00:52:36.311 --> 00:52:41.413]  We've got Clyde Lewis coming up, a really smart cook who protected the rice in an attack years ago, has the articles to prove it.
[00:52:43.237 --> 00:52:46.099]  He's been saying he believes something like the anthrax attack would come very, very soon.
[00:52:46.099 --> 00:52:49.682]  Boy, as it comes, we'll look into that next hour.
[00:52:49.682 --> 00:52:54.585]  But let me just read you a few of these headlines here, just to add to the whole Tim Cook thing.
[00:52:54.585 --> 00:52:56.967]  Study!
[00:52:56.967 --> 00:53:00.569]  91% of Apple contributions went to Democrats.
[00:53:00.569 --> 00:53:04.692]  Tim Cook says, oh, we have conservatives, we have liberals, we curate.
[00:53:04.692 --> 00:53:07.934]  You show us the weekly standard, neocons?
[00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:08.975]  Petrovskites?
[00:53:08.975 --> 00:53:09.956]  Okay, thank you, Tim Cook.
[00:53:11.237 --> 00:53:20.319]  Okay, Tim Cook has the nerve to tell you, he's gonna show you, you know, we even had a link to the RSS feed on Infowars.com for years, and millions of people subscribed to that.
[00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:35.122]  On iPhones or any other Apple device, they have a hard code now as a test of banning URLs, that's the next level, where you try to click on it, so we remove the link to it, on Mac devices, and it won't even let you go to our RSS feed.
[00:53:35.122 --> 00:53:37.943]  It takes you to Google, I mean, to Apple News, same thing.
[00:53:39.411 --> 00:53:49.417]  And they're all in bed together and they're a group of arrogant people put in charge because they'll carry out criminal racketeering.
[00:53:49.417 --> 00:53:54.140]  And so I keep going back to that because we're in a war with the CHICOMS and the EU.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:54:03.506]  But they couldn't wipe their rear ends if it wasn't for DARPA and the globalists that built the system that has now been handed over to them to bring down the country.
[00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:05.787]  Oh, but Tim Cook says he doesn't collude with the government.
[00:54:07.912 --> 00:54:16.916]  But there's Tim Cook with Zuckerberg and Obama and Eric Schmidt and all the rest of the dastardly folks.
[00:54:16.916 --> 00:54:20.177]  All toasting their technocracy over here in your family.
[00:54:20.177 --> 00:54:29.881]  Well, a lot of other people got arrogant and thought they'd dominate the West, the Holy Grail, the New Atlantis.
[00:54:29.881 --> 00:54:35.503]  Just because you hijacked the New Atlantis' technology, dumbass Cook, doesn't mean you are that.
[00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:39.321]  So we'll see what happens to you, son.
[00:54:39.321 --> 00:54:40.962]  Get ready.
[00:54:40.962 --> 00:54:44.584]  Because you'll always be a little devil-worshipping hunchback.
[00:54:44.584 --> 00:54:46.565]  Buzzard.
[00:54:46.565 --> 00:54:48.666]  And I say it's open season on your lives.
[00:54:48.666 --> 00:54:49.887]  Politically.
[00:54:49.887 --> 00:54:56.511]  In a peaceful way.
[00:54:56.511 --> 00:55:02.694]  What is it that Thulsa Dunes said?
[00:55:02.694 --> 00:55:05.476]  They're all drowned in lakes of their own lies.
[00:55:07.355 --> 00:55:12.236]  Now, look at these headlines.
[00:55:12.236 --> 00:55:17.658]  Man who's been arrested for doxing GOP senators allegedly threatened to also do to their children.
[00:55:17.658 --> 00:55:19.498]  Oh, that's always a lot of this thing.
[00:55:19.498 --> 00:55:21.799]  They're all planning this violence.
[00:55:21.799 --> 00:55:22.979]  There's all these arrests.
[00:55:22.979 --> 00:55:26.000]  Amy Schumer that literally all of her shows and movies fail.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.741]  She's a total joke.
[00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:31.481]  All Hollywood scum stomping around.
[00:55:31.481 --> 00:55:32.542]  Don't even know how to
[00:55:33.703 --> 00:55:43.750]  Take over media operations, because they're a little too stupid to get in front of the cameras and talk, so they always do some little stunt and a mindless chant, because they're followers!
[00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.791]  Next hour is coming up.
[00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:45.672]  We'll also take calls.
[00:55:45.672 --> 00:55:49.174]  David Clyde Lewis is on with us.
[00:55:49.174 --> 00:55:50.615]  Here's the deal.
[00:55:50.615 --> 00:55:55.979]  If you don't buy products from us, Soros and Globals are going to win, but that's not even the reason to do it.
[00:55:55.979 --> 00:56:01.523]  These are great products, and we have the new Happys with the ashwagandha root,
[00:56:02.961 --> 00:56:09.005]  The rhodiola, rose root, the passionflower herb, green tea leaf, and licorice root.
[00:56:09.005 --> 00:56:11.307]  Now a lot of folks are trying this, and Out of the Gauge is 50% off.
[00:56:11.307 --> 00:56:13.488]  It's our newest product, so I want you to try it and see how good it is.
[00:56:13.488 --> 00:56:16.370]  But it's not a depressant, it's not a stimulant.
[00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:17.711]  It just smooths you out.
[00:56:17.711 --> 00:56:25.857]  It is great for after work, when you can't dial back, but at the same time you don't want to, you know, take a depressant.
[00:56:27.091 --> 00:56:29.112]  It's really something else from Mother Nature.
[00:56:29.112 --> 00:56:32.974]  You can go read about all the studies and the rest of it, but it's concentrated, it's amazing.
[00:56:32.974 --> 00:56:35.435]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:40.238]  The last run of X2, the purest deep earth crystal source of iodine out there.
[00:56:40.238 --> 00:56:42.939]  It is our last run of it, even though it's a very, very best seller.
[00:56:42.939 --> 00:56:47.281]  I mean, total we sell, total it's the most profitable thing we sell.
[00:56:47.281 --> 00:56:51.683]  What we sell the most of is Brain Force Plus, but we make hardly any money on that.
[00:56:51.683 --> 00:56:54.565]  The point is we need to fund this operation, X2, last run.
[00:56:54.565 --> 00:56:56.386]  And speaking of Brain Force Plus,
[00:56:57.455 --> 00:57:01.656]  Just like it took me a couple days to take the X2 special down, so we're getting close to selling out.
[00:57:01.656 --> 00:57:04.577]  Rainforest Plus, we don't get another shipment until the middle of December.
[00:57:04.577 --> 00:57:08.358]  If I keep it up there at the sales rate, it's going to be gone.
[00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:12.639]  But I think it'll just be extended through the weekend, and that's absolutely it.
[00:57:12.639 --> 00:57:20.741]  So it's 40% off Rainforest Plus, the amazing Nootropic experience, why it's one of the top-selling Nootropics on the market, and a third of the cost of leading competitors.
[00:57:22.628 --> 00:57:26.129]  Bury the thousands of five-star reviews at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:26.129 --> 00:57:30.811]  And Secret 12, the amazing vitamin B12, rated by BuzzFeed when they test it, is the highest rate in the country.
[00:57:30.811 --> 00:57:32.331]  They couldn't believe it.
[00:57:32.331 --> 00:57:32.891]  Haha!
[00:57:32.891 --> 00:57:37.953]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:37.953 --> 00:57:45.935]  But whatever you do, tell people about that local radio station, or TV station, or cable station, because this is the most censored broadcast in the world.
[00:57:45.935 --> 00:57:48.116]  They've all heard my name, so tell them, tune in!
[00:57:50.157 --> 00:57:54.841]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:55.484]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:58:55.484 --> 00:59:04.390]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:09.734]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:18.600]  We're good to go!
[00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:56.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:14.568 --> 01:00:25.318]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.318 --> 01:00:32.825]  Well, he hosts one of the biggest syndicated radio shows in the country, Ground Zero, comes on right before George Noron, the Premier Radio Network.
[01:00:32.825 --> 01:00:35.787]  And Clyde Lewis is riding shotgun with us for two hours, we're going to cover the waterfront.
[01:00:35.787 --> 01:00:37.689]  The reason I wanted to get him on is
[01:00:41.354 --> 01:00:45.562]  I remember him predicting that there'd be another anthrax or ricin.
[01:00:45.562 --> 01:00:47.805]  I always say it wrong.
[01:00:47.805 --> 01:00:50.991]  Ricin attack, ricin, and ricin.
[01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:52.133]  And now you've seen that happen.
[01:00:53.086 --> 01:01:10.402]  And then I remember McAfee, when he escaped Belize, saying Hezbollah's being snuck in, there's thousands of them, they're cooking up massive factories of ricin, and I didn't think he was lying, but two years later it came out, Hezbollah, 4,000 plus Hezbollah, ricin.
[01:01:11.525 --> 01:01:18.675]  I mean rice and folks is deadly neurotoxin obviously as you can grow it I guess on rice and anybody can basically make it.
[01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.980]  The problem is you'll probably kill yourself in the process and so...
[01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:27.895]  He has been really hammering that he thinks there'd be a bio-attack.
[01:01:27.895 --> 01:01:35.102]  Even when I was on with him like a month ago, he said it a couple times, and he's a smart cookie, so we're gonna get his take on that, because that kind of blipped on the radar.
[01:01:35.102 --> 01:01:38.265]  And in my experience, when a terror attack's real, it gets no attention.
[01:01:38.265 --> 01:01:45.552]  When it's hyped or provocateured, then it's absolutely promoted from the rooftops everywhere, and there's always some legislation they're trying to pass.
[01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.690]  Plot Lewis's expert take on that.
[01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:55.132]  Syndicate radio host, author, researcher, filmmaker, actor, very, very, very accomplished guy.
[01:01:55.132 --> 01:02:09.216]  He'll be joining us coming up for two hours here today and then I'm trying to get the guy on we had on like a month ago who got banned off of, when his books hit number one, got banned off Amazon for misogyny.
[01:02:09.216 --> 01:02:10.897]  It wasn't even misogyny, it's just how to act like a man.
[01:02:13.137 --> 01:02:15.159]  Maybe a little bit of an extreme version of it.
[01:02:15.159 --> 01:02:16.780]  A lot of women like that, actually.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.500]  That's what they want.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.903]  But the point is, a lot of women don't like that.
[01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:24.145]  He now got banned off PayPal, and now he's just shutting down.
[01:02:24.145 --> 01:02:25.766]  He's just going off the air.
[01:02:25.766 --> 01:02:27.848]  So that's where they want this to go.
[01:02:27.848 --> 01:02:29.429]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:31.871]  That's why I sued PayPal.
[01:02:31.871 --> 01:02:34.773]  The idiot New York Times and others are like, it's his only payment processor.
[01:02:34.773 --> 01:02:35.914]  He'll be shut down.
[01:02:35.914 --> 01:02:36.695]  There's hundreds.
[01:02:37.472 --> 01:02:38.553]  Here's the problem.
[01:02:38.553 --> 01:02:41.394]  PayPal strategically has bought up most of them.
[01:02:41.394 --> 01:02:44.876]  And they got a big deal going through where they'll have almost all of them.
[01:02:44.876 --> 01:02:48.158]  So that's when we were like, whoa, we got to bring this to the president's attention.
[01:02:48.158 --> 01:02:50.359]  So in my briefings that are going to the president.
[01:02:51.274 --> 01:03:00.818]  This weekend, the briefings will be done from a top law firm, and it's packaged in with our lawsuit to show we're serious, and then some other ideas from some other law firms.
[01:03:00.818 --> 01:03:02.819]  The President takes that serious!
[01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:06.881]  And you know, it's also in hundreds of newspapers, so that will get some attention.
[01:03:06.881 --> 01:03:18.466]  So, all the left and everybody's like, ah ha ha, you're suing in San Francisco, you're gonna lose, we're gonna ban you conservatives, we're gonna run you in the ground, we're gonna totally shut you all down.
[01:03:18.466 --> 01:03:19.367]  Just keep laughing.
[01:03:20.694 --> 01:03:25.056]  Because the lawsuit is to draw attention, dumbasses.
[01:03:25.056 --> 01:03:27.537]  And I'm not talking to our radio listeners or TV viewers.
[01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.918]  It's just these leftists just don't get it.
[01:03:30.918 --> 01:03:37.821]  They don't get me spending my own money to educate people to say no to the corrupt system.
[01:03:37.821 --> 01:03:39.081]  Because I'm not a conservative.
[01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:44.583]  I'm a libertarian, renaissance patriot who loves Jesus Christ.
[01:03:44.583 --> 01:03:45.484]  And I want justice.
[01:03:45.484 --> 01:03:47.945]  And I love little black kids, little brown kids, little white kids.
[01:03:47.945 --> 01:03:48.425]  I love everybody.
[01:03:49.198 --> 01:03:51.258]  And I just want to have a future.
[01:03:51.258 --> 01:03:57.140]  And I see Trump being attacked by every side because he is the president trying to be the president.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:57.820]  You mean he's perfect?
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:58.880]  No.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.520]  But you know a man by his enemies.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.901]  And let me tell you, Trump's got the enemies, he's got the pedigree politically, and I'm totally behind it.
[01:04:05.901 --> 01:04:07.962]  And that's why they know that I've got to be destroyed.
[01:04:07.962 --> 01:04:13.803]  Because see, they know they really can't intimidate me.
[01:04:13.803 --> 01:04:15.163]  But see, they want to intimidate you.
[01:04:15.163 --> 01:04:15.764]  They want you.
[01:04:15.764 --> 01:04:17.604]  I can't tell you how many other talk show hosts I know.
[01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:27.784]  Didn't come running like a Clyde Lewis or George Norrie to get me on when I got banned, but we're regular guests who just won't even talk to us.
[01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:29.445]  Oh my God, that's the instinct of slaves.
[01:04:29.445 --> 01:04:32.788]  You might as well stick your head between your legs and kiss your butt goodbye.
[01:04:32.788 --> 01:04:36.810]  If you've got that instinct, man, North Korea is the place for you.
[01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:38.831]  God, don't you get it?
[01:04:38.831 --> 01:04:41.193]  You've got to have the instinct to say no to this.
[01:04:42.486 --> 01:04:44.467]  You know what happened?
[01:04:44.467 --> 01:04:46.208]  Facebook threatened to ban him if he had me on.
[01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:47.608]  I heard about it inside baseball.
[01:04:47.608 --> 01:04:50.230]  He said, oh, I want Alex Jones back on because of that.
[01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:53.931]  That's the instinct to save the country and the world.
[01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:54.271]  We'll be back.
[01:05:07.409 --> 01:05:09.591]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:05:09.591 --> 01:05:18.340]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.905]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:05:22.905 --> 01:05:24.346]  You are the info war.
[01:05:24.346 --> 01:05:27.870]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:39.934]  Let everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:05:39.934 --> 01:05:47.897]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:05:47.897 --> 01:05:54.940]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.701]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[01:05:59.363 --> 01:06:00.644]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:00.644 --> 01:06:02.486]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:16.094 --> 01:06:21.439]  Why aren't you brave enough to talk to us and exchange it with us?
[01:06:21.439 --> 01:06:24.042]  Don't you wave your hand at me!
[01:06:24.042 --> 01:06:25.163]  I wave my hand at you!
[01:06:25.163 --> 01:06:26.444]  When you grow up, I'll be glad to.
[01:06:26.444 --> 01:06:27.024]  When I grow up?
[01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:28.606]  You may grow up!
[01:06:28.606 --> 01:06:32.790]  How dare you talk to women that way!
[01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:35.072]  How dare you!
[01:06:35.072 --> 01:06:36.213]  How dare you!
[01:06:37.014 --> 01:06:39.215]  Senator, do you believe women?
[01:06:39.215 --> 01:06:52.280]  Senator, being in the legal field, do you think this is gonna be the new norm when appointing a Supreme Court justice?
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.001]  I don't know, man, it could be.
[01:06:55.001 --> 01:07:00.963]  People are heated right now and there's a lot of stuff going on.
[01:07:02.216 --> 01:07:05.820]  Well, we gotta operate based on the information we have available to us, man.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:15.050]  But now, the way everybody's reacting to this now, you know, every Supreme Court Justice hearing coming forward, that's gonna be going on after this.
[01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:17.673]  Well, we had one a few months ago and it didn't work out that way.
[01:07:17.673 --> 01:07:19.215]  You know, they're all different.
[01:07:19.215 --> 01:07:21.217]  This particular case touches on- Because it's a swing vote?
[01:07:22.401 --> 01:07:27.363]  It also touches on an issue that's very sensitive and obviously very important in this country.
[01:07:27.363 --> 01:07:30.104]  And it needs to be handled in an appropriate way.
[01:07:30.104 --> 01:07:32.906]  So there's a single shred of corroborating evidence.
[01:07:32.906 --> 01:07:34.626]  But you said handled in an appropriate way.
[01:07:34.626 --> 01:07:36.347]  How should it have been better?
[01:07:36.347 --> 01:07:37.528]  The gathering of information.
[01:07:37.528 --> 01:07:39.789]  I mean, we make decisions based on information.
[01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:43.270]  We've now interviewed over 150 people over two decades.
[01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:44.711]  Not a single one has corroborated.
[01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:48.513]  Any of this, if there had been a single shred of corroboration, I'd be the first one out there.
[01:07:48.513 --> 01:07:54.137]  I'm still reading through the documents.
[01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:56.598]  I agree with Marco Rubio there.
[01:07:56.598 --> 01:07:59.100]  If there's not a shred of evidence, if there was, then great.
[01:08:00.703 --> 01:08:02.504]  But if you're a radio listener, you can hear it.
[01:08:02.504 --> 01:08:04.386]  A team of yours can hear it and see it.
[01:08:04.386 --> 01:08:16.375]  There are these anti-man, hyped-up, Soros-funded women screaming and howling like there's an island of medusas or something, or harpies fighting over the one eyed.
[01:08:16.375 --> 01:08:20.678]  And the way they're going, F you to Orrin Hatch, we bleeped it out.
[01:08:20.678 --> 01:08:22.979]  And then he just says, you'll grow up while they're saying F you.
[01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:27.623]  And they go, how dare you speak to a woman as such?
[01:08:27.623 --> 01:08:28.784]  They're like going back to
[01:08:31.016 --> 01:08:38.287]  Ancient England or something where, you know, the total chivalry of not even speaking to a woman unless spoken to or whatever.
[01:08:38.287 --> 01:08:41.491]  They're going back to this, I guess, even Elizabethan.
[01:08:42.742 --> 01:08:46.386]  We're open the door for me, and I wear white gloves, and you do what I say.
[01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:49.269]  But no, no, no, they're just screaming harpies, F you, F that.
[01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:51.432]  You know, rape, rape, rape.
[01:08:51.432 --> 01:08:52.493]  And then he's like, grow up!
[01:08:52.493 --> 01:08:55.096]  How dare you!
[01:08:55.096 --> 01:08:55.937]  The polls show it.
[01:08:55.937 --> 01:08:57.579]  This has backfired on them big time.
[01:08:57.579 --> 01:09:02.885]  Clyde Lewis joins us for the balance of the next two hours of Ground Zero Radio, weeknights.
[01:09:04.146 --> 01:09:23.466]  Right before coast-to-coast AM comes on and so I guess that's a like 10 o'clock at night I've been on there many times listen to it many many times and so Clyde Lewis is here at groundzeromedia.org while he's still there at Clyde Lewis there on Twitter, but I wanted to get him back on to talk about
[01:09:24.457 --> 01:09:30.441]  Currently what's going on, the hysteria, 51 to 49 for cloture, left the Senate.
[01:09:30.441 --> 01:09:32.863]  They're going to vote tomorrow at around 5 o'clock Eastern.
[01:09:32.863 --> 01:09:35.585]  We're going to be here covering it in an internet-only transmission.
[01:09:35.585 --> 01:09:39.028]  We'll send it on satellites to radio and TV, but it's going to be commercial-free, basically.
[01:09:39.028 --> 01:09:41.389]  So we'll have some promos at the front and the back.
[01:09:41.389 --> 01:09:45.052]  We're going to have this live coverage an hour before the vote.
[01:09:45.052 --> 01:09:47.854]  Right through the vote, we're going to have crew on the ground in D.C.
[01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:48.515]  with live feeds.
[01:09:49.764 --> 01:09:55.605]  So be ready for all of that tomorrow as well at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, live coverage.
[01:09:55.605 --> 01:09:59.726]  But Clyde, this segment, let's get into the general climate.
[01:09:59.726 --> 01:10:03.527]  The Democrats calling for civil emergency, COG, you're an expert on that.
[01:10:03.527 --> 01:10:15.510]  And then I want to next segment get into your prediction of Rison, your prediction of a bio-attack you've written about, you've talked about, and why you thought it was about to happen and has now happened, and what you think's going on there.
[01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:16.210]  Great to have you with us.
[01:10:17.284 --> 01:10:18.305]  It's great to be here, Alex.
[01:10:18.305 --> 01:10:19.626]  Thank you so much for the opportunity.
[01:10:19.626 --> 01:10:21.889]  Well, let's dive into it.
[01:10:21.889 --> 01:10:23.811]  I mean, what is your take on Kavanaugh?
[01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:29.336]  What is your take on just the hysteria, the calls for violence against Republicans?
[01:10:29.336 --> 01:10:34.422]  I mean, I know you're kind of like I am, kind of a nonpartisan guy, but this is really scary.
[01:10:34.422 --> 01:10:35.743]  Yeah, it is really scary.
[01:10:35.743 --> 01:10:39.667]  And I was actually last night talking about something called the Satan Bomb.
[01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:56.025]  And what I talk about is the idea of this country leaving its morals aside and literally just throwing itself on the altar of evil for the sake of putting forward an agenda.
[01:10:56.025 --> 01:10:57.607]  This is how desperate people are.
[01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:00.450]  It's really sad to see this.
[01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:13.265]  I had said that the Arch of Baal, which was this Palmyra arch that was 3D printed by a digital archaeology company, had been erected on the day before the Judicial Senate hearings in
[01:11:13.285 --> 01:11:13.645]  Yeah.
[01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:35.864]  We're good to go.
[01:12:00.465 --> 01:12:02.246]  I totally agree.
[01:12:02.246 --> 01:12:07.189]  Let me just stop you there because I know we're going to go here.
[01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:13.233]  The globalists are obsessed with ancient Babylonian, Assyrian occultism.
[01:12:13.233 --> 01:12:20.157]  When you talk about that particular demon, they translated that in Ghostbusters into Zuul, and that's actually the one that they're worshipping in the movie.
[01:12:20.657 --> 01:12:28.263]  They make a joke and it brings your destruction, it brings world destruction and they envision Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and so that's what pops up.
[01:12:28.263 --> 01:12:31.025]  But that's what these globalists are into.
[01:12:31.025 --> 01:12:38.471]  And it's funny you raise that because you've had the major witchcraft events with thousands of witches trying to kill Trump and even Hollywood involved.
[01:12:38.471 --> 01:12:41.534]  So they really believe they're getting empowered by something.
[01:12:42.352 --> 01:12:55.098]  Well, and you're the pioneer, actually, with actually revealing the horned owl of the Bohemian Grove, which, of course, is a representation of Moloch.
[01:12:55.098 --> 01:13:01.721]  And Moloch, of course, is also another way of describing the horned god Baal.
[01:13:01.721 --> 01:13:03.102]  And what Baal represents
[01:13:03.742 --> 01:13:04.862]  Yes, I think so.
[01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:45.504]  Let's be clear, when the Jews got captured in different captivities by the Assyrians and then by the Babylonians and others, they then later adopted some of this, at least some classes in it, and so that's where you get all of this Babylon mystery religion coming into Christianity, coming into Europe.
[01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:47.825]  I mean, that's just the archaeological history of that.
[01:13:47.825 --> 01:13:54.751]  So Ghostbusters seems like a funny movie, but what they're actually showing you in an archetype is actually what the devil worshippers are into.
[01:13:55.868 --> 01:14:15.286]  Right, and so when you have an arch being set up before the testimony given with, you know, Ford Cavanaugh, and you know that everything they're talking about has to do with sexual perversion, abortion, all of these things, baby killing.
[01:14:15.286 --> 01:14:18.909]  I mean, it all seems to come together, and what's interesting is one of the first
[01:14:19.609 --> 01:14:28.934]  Uh, points that were made was, uh, I think it was, uh, White House, Sheldon Whitehouse said, somebody in fact, he said, do you know what the devil's triangle is?
[01:14:28.934 --> 01:14:39.340]  And of course, we all know that there's this place out in Bermuda or whatever, but, uh, no, they were referring to what would be a, a sexual menage a trois, if you will.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.901]  And I just thought, wow, that seals it right there.
[01:14:41.901 --> 01:14:45.663]  They're talking about all of this, including, uh, some sort of perversion.
[01:14:46.984 --> 01:14:47.885]  Yes, sex magic.
[01:14:47.885 --> 01:14:48.846]  It's exactly what it is.
[01:14:48.846 --> 01:14:50.247]  It is sex magic.
[01:14:50.247 --> 01:15:11.808]  And what is even more frightening is that the the Ricin attacks also has a sort of a cult significance as when Ricin was sent to the president, sent to Ted Cruz's office, it was done on a day where the moon had entered into
[01:15:15.555 --> 01:15:16.956]  We're good to go.
[01:15:37.695 --> 01:15:40.116]  Devil type of activity going on.
[01:15:40.116 --> 01:15:43.898]  And again, it all sounds like insane because we're not insane, but the globalists are into the occult.
[01:15:43.898 --> 01:15:46.038]  Clyde Lewis is an amazing investigator.
[01:15:46.038 --> 01:15:48.199]  We're gonna come back, look at the riots and attacks straight ahead.
[01:15:48.199 --> 01:15:50.960]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.081]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:15:57.705 --> 01:15:58.906]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.906 --> 01:16:04.289]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.289 --> 01:16:07.191]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.191 --> 01:16:10.773]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.773 --> 01:16:18.358]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:16:27.341 --> 01:16:33.708]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.708 --> 01:16:36.751]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.751 --> 01:16:42.677]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.677 --> 01:16:46.461]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.461 --> 01:16:47.382]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.702 --> 01:16:48.663]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.663 --> 01:16:55.247]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:55.247 --> 01:16:57.289]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.289 --> 01:17:00.231]  Never wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[01:17:00.231 --> 01:17:04.794]  Vercel Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.
[01:17:05.114 --> 01:17:10.676]  Decentralized blockchain solutions are making the world more transparent and giving power back to the people.

[01:17:59.252 --> 01:18:02.234]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[01:18:02.234 --> 01:18:04.815]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[01:18:04.815 --> 01:18:05.695]  No one else has this.
[01:18:05.695 --> 01:18:08.757]  From deep earth, crystals between 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[01:18:08.757 --> 01:18:10.238]  It's very hard for me to get.
[01:18:10.238 --> 01:18:12.059]  It's the good halogens.
[01:18:12.059 --> 01:18:14.240]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:20.804]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[01:18:20.804 --> 01:18:23.385]  Bio-Truth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[01:18:23.385 --> 01:18:24.806]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[01:18:26.106 --> 01:18:31.828]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[01:18:31.828 --> 01:18:33.629]  So these go incredibly well together.
[01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:35.209]  We have a combo of those.
[01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:36.570]  Just experience it for yourself.
[01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:39.290]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:40.331]  Very simple stuff.
[01:18:40.331 --> 01:18:41.971]  Filter your water.
[01:18:41.971 --> 01:18:44.052]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.613]  Best out there for the price.
[01:18:45.613 --> 01:18:46.593]  When I say it's the last run,
[01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:49.391]  I think it'll be six months to a year until we get more.
[01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:50.231]  I hope we get more.
[01:18:50.231 --> 01:18:51.531]  This is the last run it looks like.
[01:18:51.531 --> 01:18:52.412]  Survival Short X2.
[01:18:52.412 --> 01:18:58.294]  InfoWars4.com or InfoWarsLife.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:18:58.294 --> 01:19:02.215]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:12.222]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:19:12.222 --> 01:19:14.203]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:19:14.203 --> 01:19:17.664]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:19:17.664 --> 01:19:20.285]  And I knew we had no future, we didn't do this.
[01:19:20.285 --> 01:19:22.566]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:19:22.566 --> 01:19:29.509]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:19:30.069 --> 01:19:39.851]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:19:39.851 --> 01:19:41.031]  We'll win.
[01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:43.352]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:19:43.352 --> 01:19:51.094]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:19:51.094 --> 01:19:54.794]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[01:19:54.794 --> 01:19:56.355]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[01:19:56.355 --> 01:19:57.015]  We need your support.
[01:19:57.015 --> 01:19:57.755]  I'm counting on you.
[01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:03.965]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.988 --> 01:20:18.130]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.
[01:20:18.130 --> 01:20:19.371]  What do you mean, biblical?
[01:20:19.371 --> 01:20:22.172]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
[01:20:22.172 --> 01:20:24.333]  Real wrath of God type stuff.
[01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:26.474]  Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[01:20:26.474 --> 01:20:27.875]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:28.835]  Forty years of darkness.
[01:20:28.835 --> 01:20:29.956]  Earthquakes, volcanoes.
[01:20:29.956 --> 01:20:31.537]  The dead rising from the grave.
[01:20:31.537 --> 01:20:32.717]  Human sacrifice.
[01:20:32.717 --> 01:20:34.398]  Dogs and cats living together.
[01:20:34.398 --> 01:20:35.459]  Mass hysteria!
[01:20:37.456 --> 01:20:46.980]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.580]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:55.263]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.655]  Nimble little minks, ain't you?
[01:21:11.655 --> 01:21:13.715]  We're gonna go full steam.
[01:21:13.715 --> 01:21:18.477]  Aim for the flat top!
[01:21:18.477 --> 01:21:34.202]  Weren't so hard?
[01:21:34.202 --> 01:21:35.102]  We neutralized it!
[01:21:35.828 --> 01:21:36.589]  You know what that means?
[01:21:36.589 --> 01:21:38.752]  A complete particle reversal!
[01:21:38.752 --> 01:21:40.214]  And we have the tools!
[01:21:40.214 --> 01:21:41.756]  We have the talent!
[01:21:41.756 --> 01:21:44.180]  It's Miller time!
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:47.905]  Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
[01:21:47.905 --> 01:21:48.225]  Oh, no.
[01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:31.880]  Now we're showing you this, and we're going to pull up the part I had on YouTube over there, where it shows the archway.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:35.843]  It's an acrylic archway in Ghostbusters, and then it shows the pyramid behind it.
[01:22:35.843 --> 01:22:37.725]  And if you go to Syria, that's what they actually built.
[01:22:37.725 --> 01:22:40.127]  And this was a gateway they believed that the devil came through.
[01:22:40.127 --> 01:22:42.609]  And they called it Zuzu or Zuul.
[01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:46.031]  So you go see Ghostbusters, you're like, oh it's a movie, it's made up, what is this?
[01:22:46.031 --> 01:22:47.933]  I'm going to come in there, I'm going to pull it up myself, it's alright.
[01:22:50.413 --> 01:22:54.454]  I didn't even know Clyde Lewis would, there it is, would go to this.
[01:22:54.454 --> 01:22:57.635]  Now let's pull up the arts, the Democrats just rebuilt again.
[01:22:57.635 --> 01:23:09.398]  Because when you understand they're crazy, they believe they're getting this evil power, and they see Kavanaugh that's anti-abortion, and Trump, and all this pro-human stuff, that's why they're flipping out, that's why they're going crazy.
[01:23:09.398 --> 01:23:15.420]  And so it's very astute that you brought this up, because look, I'm not into the occult, I don't believe in all this stuff, they do.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:18.781]  Like Soros is admittedly into all this spirit cooking and Aleister Crowley stuff.
[01:23:20.933 --> 01:23:30.141]  Clyde, I'm glad you brought all this up, because this is really central, and we can make jokes about it, and I make jokes about it, but it's not funny.
[01:23:30.141 --> 01:23:42.452]  They're at Bohemian Grove, Republican, a lot of the Republican leadership, not anymore, more and more they don't go, are there worshipping, you know, call it an owl, call it a bull, doesn't matter, that has a platform where they burn a kid and they say, this is mullet.
[01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:44.652]  And they go, oh, you're an idiot, Jones.
[01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.033]  Moloch is a bull.
[01:23:46.033 --> 01:23:46.653]  It doesn't matter.
[01:23:46.653 --> 01:23:47.513]  They call it an owl.
[01:23:47.513 --> 01:23:48.774]  It doesn't matter.
[01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:50.775]  The point is they take it deadly serious.
[01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:51.395]  I've been there.
[01:23:51.395 --> 01:23:52.176]  I've covered it.
[01:23:52.176 --> 01:23:57.679]  When I went to Bohemian Grove in 2000, I didn't believe it was actually going to happen.
[01:23:57.679 --> 01:23:59.280]  I thought it was made up.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:23:59.920]  But it was real.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.161]  And they were taking it deadly serious.
[01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:03.702]  So, Clyde Lewis, I want to get into all the other big subjects next segment.
[01:24:03.702 --> 01:24:07.464]  But this segment, what is driving this occultism?
[01:24:07.464 --> 01:24:08.645]  Because it's real.
[01:24:08.645 --> 01:24:11.786]  I mean, and occultism is expanding.
[01:24:11.786 --> 01:24:12.587]  What do you think's behind it?
[01:24:13.575 --> 01:24:21.360]  Well, there have been a lot of polls lately that have said that a lot of young people today are more into secularism.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.924]  They're looking to science to find the answers to a lot of spiritual questions.
[01:24:26.924 --> 01:24:35.110]  And this is something that I think is quite disturbing, because what this is is we have failed in a lot of ways, I think.
[01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:50.738]  We have failed in teaching our children a lot of things regarding spirituality, teaching our children a lot of things that, you know, put them in a position to be, you know, believers in God, or at least having a spiritual sense.
[01:24:50.738 --> 01:24:53.760]  But the spiritual sense is completely destroyed, and this is something that grooms
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:54.540]  We're good to go.
[01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:20.334]  I think so.
[01:25:37.714 --> 01:25:42.856]  Who was a fiction writer, but he said, since he was a Fabian socialist, he said, that's the agenda.
[01:25:42.856 --> 01:25:54.439]  The agenda is going to be winning over the young people, having them fight for this, and doing so by grooming them and changing their views on everything from government to religion.
[01:25:56.872 --> 01:26:01.058]  And, again, they're erecting satanic temples all over the country, they're doing all this.
[01:26:01.058 --> 01:26:04.802]  They go, oh, satanists, we're just into libertarianism and human empowerment.
[01:26:04.802 --> 01:26:07.025]  But that's not what real satanism is.
[01:26:07.025 --> 01:26:12.652]  Real satanism is about total domination over reality and making other people submit to your will.
[01:26:12.652 --> 01:26:14.415]  It's not about empowering individuals' wills.
[01:26:15.498 --> 01:26:19.620]  Well, I mean, you've got a number of different, uh, I guess you could call them groups of Satanists.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:23.381]  You have Levain Satanists, which say... Yeah, you've got people claiming they're Satanists that really aren't.
[01:26:23.381 --> 01:26:29.063]  That's what I... They're trying to act like shocking, but... Well, tell me what you think a real Satanist is versus a Luciferian.
[01:26:29.775 --> 01:26:38.658]  Well, Luciferians are kind of Illuminati-type individuals who are looking for knowledge, and they use Lucifer as the symbol for knowledge and enlightenment.
[01:26:38.658 --> 01:26:50.323]  When you're looking at Satan, however, the Fallen One, there are people who use Satan as an icon of, basically, atheism, saying, well, I don't believe in God or the devil, and so they call themselves Satanists, for lack of a better term.
[01:26:50.963 --> 01:26:51.344]  Well, I think
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.160]  We're good to go.
[01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:33.454]  It's all about abortion.
[01:27:33.454 --> 01:27:34.254]  It's all about baby killing.
[01:27:34.254 --> 01:27:35.835]  It's all about sex.
[01:27:57.944 --> 01:28:10.435]  It's all about homosexual sex, the Devil's Triangle, all these buzzwords that people like Sheldon Whitehouse were just so happy to basically parade around the hearing and to talk about.
[01:28:10.435 --> 01:28:17.801]  And this was something that really made me feel uncomfortable, because this certainly smacked of a lot of
[01:28:19.482 --> 01:28:25.984]  I totally agree.
[01:28:25.984 --> 01:28:27.525]  Let's come back into the hard subject.
[01:28:27.525 --> 01:28:28.145]  I like Trump.
[01:28:28.145 --> 01:28:28.906]  He's a good guy.
[01:28:28.906 --> 01:28:30.286]  His energy's positive.
[01:28:30.286 --> 01:28:31.547]  He's trying to fix things.
[01:28:31.547 --> 01:28:32.947]  He's trying to give Christians freedom.
[01:28:32.947 --> 01:28:38.390]  But Kavanaugh's a Bush minion and a Karl Rove minion, and they're all skull and bones.
[01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:43.011]  And you get into that area of the East Coast, the rest of it, Kavanaugh's got a pretty good voting record.
[01:28:43.011 --> 01:28:43.752]  But I'm going to be honest here.
[01:28:44.432 --> 01:28:46.056]  Devil's Triangle is not a drinking game.
[01:28:46.056 --> 01:28:47.720]  It is menage a trois.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.045]  So, let's look at it.
[01:28:50.045 --> 01:28:52.189]  What's really going on with Kavanaugh?
[01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:54.053]  Could he be the ultimate Trojan horse?
[01:28:54.053 --> 01:28:54.575]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.486 --> 01:29:04.250]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:08.512]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[01:33:36.197 --> 01:33:37.038]  Are you a god?
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:54.800]  No.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.800]  Then...
[01:34:19.076 --> 01:34:20.697]  Ricin attacks.
[01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:22.238]  They can be grown on castor beans.
[01:34:22.238 --> 01:34:25.980]  I also read they can grow it on rice.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:28.161]  But the point is, and then it happened.
[01:34:28.161 --> 01:34:30.882]  And then he gets into how it's part of a larger occult ritual.
[01:34:30.882 --> 01:34:32.423]  Who was a crazy guy when I was a kid?
[01:34:32.423 --> 01:34:39.407]  Poisoned the treaty oak they signed the Texas Constitution on with a bunch of poison because he thought he'd get satanic power out of it.
[01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:41.148]  I don't believe in this stuff.
[01:34:41.148 --> 01:34:43.229]  These crazies do.
[01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:47.151]  And occultic activities are exploding.
[01:34:47.151 --> 01:34:48.372]  Now I think Brett Kavanaugh
[01:34:49.571 --> 01:34:57.717]  Overall has a really good, strict, constructionist, constitutional background.
[01:34:57.717 --> 01:34:59.978]  And so I don't think he's a bad guy.
[01:34:59.978 --> 01:35:05.262]  And I don't want to have even wars with the old establishment, because the libertarian renaissance movement is defeating them.
[01:35:05.262 --> 01:35:07.323]  I want to just move past it.
[01:35:07.323 --> 01:35:09.685]  The Clinton Stay Behind Network, though, is still there with Soros.
[01:35:09.685 --> 01:35:12.547]  That's why I'm at war with them, because they're still in power to a certain extent.
[01:35:15.171 --> 01:35:19.994]  You hear about Devil's Triangle, that is a drinking gang, the creator of it said.
[01:35:19.994 --> 01:35:25.157]  And so when I brought up the Kavanaugh thing, it's the Democrats invoking that.
[01:35:25.157 --> 01:35:39.526]  But I think it's fair to also bring up Skull and Bones, the Bushes, the fact that Kavanaugh was brought in under Bush, and that's why Trump brought him in thinking, well he's got a pretty good voting record as a conservative, he'll back the president.
[01:35:40.942 --> 01:35:44.884]  Well, I think that, you know, we ought to always say to ourselves that it's not about
[01:36:11.167 --> 01:36:15.149]  It's not about the worst of two evils or the best of two evils.
[01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:26.215]  We always seem to deal with evil and it's just, I guess, it's the intent or what is eventually going to happen with this.
[01:36:26.215 --> 01:36:36.220]  I would say that it's certainly, if he does get confirmed, which I think he will too, I think it's going to put a lot of pressure on him to be ever mindful
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:37.081]  I think so.
[01:36:57.132 --> 01:36:59.273]  Has something happened that's peculiar or weird?
[01:36:59.273 --> 01:37:01.334]  It's because they planned it that way.
[01:37:01.334 --> 01:37:04.555]  And that is something that I think a lot of people need to understand.
[01:37:04.555 --> 01:37:05.956]  It was FDR that said that.
[01:37:05.956 --> 01:37:09.757]  He said, well, if it happens in government, you know, it's because we planned it.
[01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:15.280]  And it just seems to me that this seems... It seems to me that things seem to be going as planned.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:20.663]  And it just seems like a very interesting plan, bit by bit, play by play.
[01:37:20.663 --> 01:37:22.124]  See, I see patterns.
[01:37:22.124 --> 01:37:30.270]  And I'm like you, I believe this, that it's not what I believe as far as the occult is concerned, it's what they believe.
[01:37:31.210 --> 01:37:49.640]  And so if they believe it, and they practice it, and they like their little medieval dramas with worshipping owls and jumping around naked in front of an owl in the Bohemian Grove, and if they like their little arches, and if they like their little demonic hand signs, and if they like their Twilight language like Devil's Triangle and other things, you know that there are people
[01:37:50.752 --> 01:37:51.052]  I think?
[01:38:05.126 --> 01:38:06.687]  And I've seen that all the time.
[01:38:06.687 --> 01:38:07.867]  I see it all the time.
[01:38:07.867 --> 01:38:14.031]  Of course, my exposure, some of my first exposure to it was from Spy Magazine and from you.
[01:38:14.031 --> 01:38:19.994]  So, I mean, the triggering of the Bohemian Grove meme is certainly right here and now.
[01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:21.894]  Now, I don't know, is Kavanaugh a bonesman?
[01:38:21.894 --> 01:38:23.475]  I didn't really know if he was or if he wasn't.
[01:38:23.475 --> 01:38:24.856]  No, no, I don't think he's a bonesman.
[01:38:24.856 --> 01:38:26.257]  I just think it's reasonable.
[01:38:27.117 --> 01:38:35.302]  As some listeners, you know, have said, hey, you know, look, Roger Stone wrote articles about him, you know, 80-something days ago saying, look out, you know, we want Barrett, not him.
[01:38:35.302 --> 01:38:35.742]  Whatever.
[01:38:35.742 --> 01:38:37.223]  The point is, he's got a pretty good voting record.
[01:38:37.223 --> 01:38:45.008]  Let me ask you this, and I'm going to play a clip actually from The Good Shepherd, about Skull & Bones, that Robert De Niro produced, that Matt Damon's in.
[01:38:45.008 --> 01:38:47.869]  It was actually a pretty accurate movie.
[01:38:47.869 --> 01:38:50.411]  Why do you think the establishment hates Trump so much?
[01:38:52.068 --> 01:38:54.069]  Because he's not part of that system.
[01:38:54.069 --> 01:38:55.950]  It was like what Newt Gingrich says.
[01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:57.391]  He hasn't gone through the rituals.
[01:38:57.391 --> 01:39:00.873]  He hasn't gone through the hazing process.
[01:39:00.873 --> 01:39:05.735]  He was a man who does his own thing, who sets his own rules.
[01:39:05.735 --> 01:39:11.759]  He doesn't bow or answer to any secret societal mayhem.
[01:39:11.759 --> 01:39:16.661]  He may know of it, but he certainly doesn't know how to deal with it, I don't think, as much as the others do.
[01:39:16.661 --> 01:39:19.723]  They know how to deal with the secret handshakes and hand signs and symbols.
[01:39:20.163 --> 01:39:22.393]  You know, it's funny because... He just blows past all that.
[01:39:22.393 --> 01:39:25.405]  His secret sign is the economy doing well.
[01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:37.539]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you read any postmodern philosophy, like by Jean Baudrillard, who said that we're living in times where symbols mean more than reality itself.
[01:39:37.539 --> 01:39:43.405]  And it's because, consciously and subconsciously, we respond to these symbols.
[01:39:43.405 --> 01:39:51.391]  That's why, you know, you can take a swastika into the Eastern world, and they'll see it as a symbol of peace.
[01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:54.134]  You tilt it one way, and it turns into a sign of Nazism.
[01:39:54.554 --> 01:39:55.375]  We're good to go.
[01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:14.430]  Actually, this is wired into our DNA, these symbols and signs.
[01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:19.852]  And so if you see them, and you're aware of them, it basically sends red flags.
[01:40:19.852 --> 01:40:29.675]  If you don't know about them, it still sends red flags, because cellular, on a cellular level, the body and the mind and the soul responds to ancient symbolism.
[01:40:29.895 --> 01:40:31.256]  That's right, and let's explain that.
[01:40:31.256 --> 01:40:36.501]  These evil groups have taken over every major power symbol and turned it around for their control.
[01:40:36.501 --> 01:40:41.605]  So why does Chelsea Clinton hundreds of times photo with upside-down crosses?
[01:40:41.605 --> 01:40:42.566]  Why do they do this?
[01:40:42.566 --> 01:40:44.708]  Why are they into these dark forces?
[01:40:44.708 --> 01:40:51.474]  Because they're going against the countervailing wisdom and force of humanity to succeed and empower and be loving.
[01:40:51.474 --> 01:40:55.718]  They want to countervail that and control it, so they have to try to hijack it
[01:40:56.418 --> 01:41:00.280]  And then do really wicked things, they believe, to destroy their soul.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.881]  They don't know that's happening.
[01:41:01.881 --> 01:41:06.383]  So they get closer to being like anti-human.
[01:41:06.383 --> 01:41:07.824]  I mean, that's really what's happening.
[01:41:07.824 --> 01:41:14.507]  And once they're done, people like Bill Clinton and Hillary are these robots, people that I know that know them.
[01:41:14.507 --> 01:41:20.230]  They're just these hateful, unhappy robots that just go around grasping like zombies.
[01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:21.590]  I mean, it's horrible.
[01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:23.071]  But they believe that's enlightenment.
[01:41:23.942 --> 01:41:28.706]  Well, I heard a definition once of what a monster is, and it's a very simple description.
[01:41:28.706 --> 01:41:32.789]  A monster is a human being who doesn't care.
[01:41:32.789 --> 01:41:34.790]  And that's how you become a monster.
[01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:36.672]  You just become... you don't care.
[01:41:37.503 --> 01:41:40.704]  And what is the whole purpose of the cremation of care?
[01:41:40.704 --> 01:41:44.186]  We release from ourselves any responsibility.
[01:41:44.186 --> 01:41:48.167]  We release from ourselves any care.
[01:41:48.167 --> 01:42:00.932]  You're getting rid of the conscience in a black magic ritual to take the metaphysical reap what you sow law of the universe and pass it on to a child, which is the very essence of hardcore black magic.
[01:42:01.610 --> 01:42:07.135]  And the definition of a vampire is a vampire that robs you not only of your blood, but of your virtue.
[01:42:07.135 --> 01:42:08.317]  And that is what is at stake here.
[01:42:08.317 --> 01:42:09.538]  And of your seed.
[01:42:09.538 --> 01:42:17.806]  Because it's one thing to suck somebody's blood or their money or their power, but if you kill their kids, if you take their line, now that's real power.
[01:42:18.783 --> 01:42:19.504]  Right.
[01:42:19.504 --> 01:42:22.427]  It's the idea that if you can eliminate progeny.
[01:42:22.427 --> 01:42:25.130]  I mean, what was the whole purpose of the Garden of Eden?
[01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:35.802]  The Garden of Eden, when Adam and Eve ate of the fruit, it was, we want to corrupt the DNA of mankind because we look at them as abnormal monkeys.
[01:42:35.802 --> 01:42:37.444]  And that's the true satanic ritual.
[01:42:37.444 --> 01:42:39.006]  Clyde Lewis is so smart.
[01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:40.386]  We'll be right back with him.
[01:42:40.386 --> 01:42:43.247]  We'll get into more political stuff and take your calls next hour.
[01:42:43.247 --> 01:42:50.710]  But thegroundzeromedia.org, amazing, at Clyde Lewis, at Twitter, and tune in tonight, obviously, 10 o'clock Central, right before George Norie.
[01:42:50.710 --> 01:42:51.510]  So we'll be right back.
[01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:55.892]  On the other side, though, to get more into this, and a clip from Inside Skull & Bones via Hollywood.
[01:42:57.478 --> 01:42:57.498]  X2.
[01:43:28.078 --> 01:43:30.499]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[01:43:30.499 --> 01:43:31.659]  Ordered it six months ago.
[01:43:31.659 --> 01:43:33.219]  So I get the price down.
[01:43:33.219 --> 01:43:34.959]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:43:34.959 --> 01:43:36.200]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.160]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.540]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:41.880]  In fact, right now, it is the last run.
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:44.341]  I'm sure it's viable shield X2.
[01:43:44.341 --> 01:43:45.841]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[01:43:45.841 --> 01:43:47.541]  It'll be gone a couple months.

[01:47:01.443 --> 01:47:04.066]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:22.033 --> 01:47:31.175]  Alright, we're going to open the phones up next hour.
[01:47:31.175 --> 01:47:43.377]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live with Clyde Lewis.
[01:47:43.377 --> 01:47:46.718]  Next hour we're going to open the phones up on Brett Kavanaugh.
[01:47:46.718 --> 01:47:47.678]  Will he be confirmed?
[01:47:47.678 --> 01:47:49.519]  What do you think about the occult?
[01:47:49.519 --> 01:47:50.319]  All of it, but here's the thing.
[01:47:51.311 --> 01:47:52.512]  The hidden exists.
[01:47:52.512 --> 01:47:57.978]  The establishment being involved and obsessed with the occult is a fact.
[01:47:57.978 --> 01:47:58.959]  And so why is that?
[01:47:58.959 --> 01:48:01.101]  I think Clyde Lewis put his finger on it earlier.
[01:48:01.101 --> 01:48:03.904]  We're going to go to him in a moment.
[01:48:03.904 --> 01:48:05.586]  It's on our DNA.
[01:48:05.586 --> 01:48:09.390]  Our ancient species, our incredible background, all the things we've been through.
[01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:11.532]  Obviously the mainline history we're given is not the truth.
[01:48:11.532 --> 01:48:13.694]  It's like everything else we're told is a lie.
[01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:21.664]  And so this is some language, some system that we, through ancestral memories that they've proven are real.
[01:48:21.664 --> 01:48:27.047]  In all major developed species, the enemy has our owner's manual, they have our program.
[01:48:27.047 --> 01:48:35.131]  They are not more advanced than us, they're not better than us, but they're older than us or have a longer memory.
[01:48:35.131 --> 01:48:39.893]  And so they are able to manipulate us through the archetypes.
[01:48:41.391 --> 01:48:45.753]  And that's really the secret, and they don't want you to become aware of that.
[01:48:45.753 --> 01:48:49.935]  Well, I want you to become aware of that.
[01:48:49.935 --> 01:48:55.918]  So we're going to be talking about McLeod Lewis here, and then we'll next hour get into all the big current, you know, temporal, provable topics.
[01:48:55.918 --> 01:49:09.704]  But he brought us into the whole occult area today, and we're going to play a clip from a film that came out over a decade ago, The Good Shepherd, with Matt Damon, produced by Robert De Niro, directed by Robert De Niro, that from people that I know that have been in Skull & Bones, and Charlotte Iserby, who's
[01:49:10.692 --> 01:49:14.476]  Father and others were in it and released the secret documents to Anthony Sutton.
[01:49:15.481 --> 01:49:17.082]  This is just the beginning.
[01:49:17.082 --> 01:49:21.825]  So we'll show you inside a ritual of Skull and Bones here in a moment.
[01:49:21.825 --> 01:49:27.889]  The ABC News caught a little bit of footage from outside where death equals death, murder equals death, devil equals death.
[01:49:27.889 --> 01:49:30.051]  And like simulating murder.
[01:49:30.051 --> 01:49:33.773]  And that's just kind of training the young ones for the real thing later.
[01:49:33.773 --> 01:49:38.696]  So it's more like a nursery school or an outer temple.
[01:49:38.696 --> 01:49:41.818]  Of course, any real Skull and Bones members or higher levels are probably killing people at about age 12.
[01:49:42.899 --> 01:49:49.921]  This is more wimpy blue bloods are brought in to be trained before they go to the next level.
[01:49:49.921 --> 01:49:53.362]  Listen, if you don't fund us, you already know that, we'll be shut down.
[01:49:53.362 --> 01:49:56.263]  But you are funding us, so thank you.
[01:49:56.263 --> 01:49:57.964]  I need to be flooded with capital.
[01:49:57.964 --> 01:49:59.804]  We have great products at very low prices.
[01:49:59.804 --> 01:50:12.248]  So something like Knockout, that is an amazing combination of melatonin and L-tryptophan and valerian root and lemon balm and chamomile and a bunch of other things.
[01:50:13.595 --> 01:50:18.658]  It's the same amount as a bottle of melatonin that has the same dose.
[01:50:18.658 --> 01:50:21.520]  They're just putting a dollar of product in it and selling it for $19.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.443]  We put, you know, $7, $8, $9, $10 of product in it and sell it for $19.
[01:50:25.443 --> 01:50:28.325]  So it's available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[01:50:28.325 --> 01:50:29.446]  You get great products.
[01:50:29.446 --> 01:50:30.987]  It's like our information's hardcore.
[01:50:30.987 --> 01:50:32.228]  You fund the operation.
[01:50:32.228 --> 01:50:36.691]  Sign up for AutoShip and then that way you'll just automatically get delivered it.
[01:50:36.691 --> 01:50:37.391]  You get 10% off.
[01:50:39.031 --> 01:50:49.342]  It had a 98% review six months ago, but the left all goes on to power reviews and does false reviews against us, and they brigade and organize as if you don't know how great the products are.
[01:50:49.342 --> 01:50:51.164]  It's so funny.
[01:50:51.164 --> 01:50:51.964]  But it's only 91% review now.
[01:50:51.964 --> 01:50:52.305]  Sorry, only 91%.
[01:50:52.305 --> 01:50:54.887]  So, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:51:02.648 --> 01:51:05.813]  It's discounted right now, but it's close to selling out.
[01:51:05.813 --> 01:51:08.156]  So is Brain Force Plus, our great new traffic.
[01:51:08.156 --> 01:51:09.278]  It's 40% off.
[01:51:09.278 --> 01:51:14.405]  Secret 12, BuzzFeed tested it and said, well, it's pure B12, but here's the best in the country, this other brand.
[01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:18.470]  This was Mark Cuban's lab, did it.
[01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:21.231]  What he said was the best in the country was what we private labeled.
[01:51:21.231 --> 01:51:22.572]  It's hilarious.
[01:51:22.572 --> 01:51:23.732]  Ours is $10 less, so.
[01:51:23.732 --> 01:51:25.373]  A lot of our stuff's private labeled.
[01:51:25.373 --> 01:51:27.434]  Whatever the best is, we private label it and discount it.
[01:51:27.434 --> 01:51:29.255]  A lot of our stuff's proprietary and original.
[01:51:29.255 --> 01:51:30.676]  But it's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:51:30.676 --> 01:51:36.238]  But I will end the special on Secret 12 and RainForce this Sunday.
[01:51:36.238 --> 01:51:42.301]  It's got to end because more is coming in the middle of December, and at current rates, we'll sell out by November.
[01:51:43.361 --> 01:51:43.661]  I don't know.
[01:51:58.012 --> 01:52:03.537]  They're psychopathic, or at least sociopathic, and they have given themselves over to the programming.
[01:52:03.537 --> 01:52:08.201]  So you and I look at it and it looks like a bunch of gibberish because we're dialed into the whole universe.
[01:52:08.201 --> 01:52:20.212]  So I would say it's a good thing that a lot of folks are susceptible to the programming, but we have to learn what these symbols are, what their antecedents are, to then see them and understand the larger attack that's taking place.
[01:52:20.212 --> 01:52:21.494]  And there's not just evil in the universe.
[01:52:22.114 --> 01:52:25.456]  Most of these symbols were ours, given by our Creator.
[01:52:25.456 --> 01:52:27.097]  We're making the image up, by the way.
[01:52:27.097 --> 01:52:27.877]  That's a big deal.
[01:52:27.877 --> 01:52:29.458]  That's a little clue right there.
[01:52:29.458 --> 01:52:33.240]  These are symbols, like the star, the pentacle, that's given to us.
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:34.981]  So it doesn't mean it's even evil.
[01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:40.064]  It's been expropriated, and then the system has hijacked it as a counterfeiter.
[01:52:40.064 --> 01:52:42.165]  Like the Bible says, the devil's a counterfeiter.
[01:52:42.165 --> 01:52:43.786]  So look at Clyde Lewis' take on that.
[01:52:43.786 --> 01:52:45.186]  Into the next hour, and take your calls.
[01:52:45.186 --> 01:52:46.067]  We'll give the number out in a moment.
[01:52:46.067 --> 01:52:47.968]  But first, here's a clip from The Good Shepherd.
[01:52:48.899 --> 01:52:49.199]  I think?
[01:53:07.325 --> 01:53:08.186]  Okay?
[01:53:08.186 --> 01:53:14.751]  They're wrestling butt naked in mud while other members in this group, they start pissing on them and laughing.
[01:53:14.751 --> 01:53:15.311]  Okay?
[01:53:15.311 --> 01:53:21.116]  And you see here in this scene Matt Damon gets upset and he walks out because he just got humiliated.
[01:53:21.116 --> 01:53:24.759]  Now one might watch this movie and think it's part of the movie.
[01:53:24.759 --> 01:53:27.200]  It's, you know, it's not something that they really do.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:30.363]  It's just an act or whatever, but that's further from the truth.
[01:53:30.363 --> 01:53:33.746]  And that's an internet clip we got with someone's commentary.
[01:53:33.746 --> 01:53:36.708]  But the point is you can find the clip out there without that if you want.
[01:53:37.668 --> 01:53:42.052]  But the reason I play that is, it's all about humiliation at that level.
[01:53:42.052 --> 01:53:55.181]  Submitting, telling them all your hopes, all your dreams, and then later you try to clear yourself out so you can be possessed in a coffin, you know, after ten guys have, you know, done a gangbang on you.
[01:53:55.181 --> 01:53:59.444]  And then after they've done that, then you're on to the next level.
[01:53:59.444 --> 01:54:01.425]  Clyde Lewis, why do you think this is going on?
[01:54:01.425 --> 01:54:03.787]  Again, why is there this obsession with this?
[01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:11.677]  Well, there's power in sex magic, and some of the groups that are well-known, like the O.T.O.
[01:54:11.677 --> 01:54:14.820]  and other groups, of course they practice sex magic.
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:17.042]  There's a lot of power in the orgasm.
[01:54:17.042 --> 01:54:18.903]  There's a lot of power in bringing that forward.
[01:54:18.903 --> 01:54:28.672]  In fact, if you want a sigil to be energized, usually people who are magicians or wizards or whomever, they'll tell you that the best way to power up a sigil or a
[01:54:31.087 --> 01:54:32.808]  We're good to go.
[01:54:49.675 --> 01:54:52.078]  You've seen, like I say, the robbing of virtue.
[01:54:52.078 --> 01:54:56.822]  Young people, young women, young men becoming sexual objects.
[01:54:56.822 --> 01:54:58.303]  We know of the Franklin scandal.
[01:54:58.303 --> 01:55:02.787]  We know of the situation where those boys were harmed.
[01:55:02.787 --> 01:55:08.472]  We know the stories of boys that are brought to the Bohemian Grove for this type of thing.
[01:55:08.472 --> 01:55:12.896]  I mean, trafficking and pedophilia, all of this is a part of it.
[01:55:14.978 --> 01:55:17.000]  And it's beyond the pizza gate.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.481]  It's beyond that.
[01:55:18.481 --> 01:55:19.202]  It's all of that.
[01:55:19.202 --> 01:55:27.850]  But, you know, we become specific, and that's where the media has their paydays, because you become specific in one area, and they say, well, it's not happening here.
[01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:31.493]  But what they exclude is it's happening in a lot of places.
[01:55:31.493 --> 01:55:35.497]  And we see a lot of it being revealed and hinted at.
[01:55:36.266 --> 01:55:45.537]  But we never seem to find ourselves in a situation where we can nab the offenders, because the offenders are high-powered, highly paid individuals.
[01:55:45.537 --> 01:55:53.807]  And so, you know, what the Me Too movement doesn't do is it doesn't identify some of the perpetrators who have actually harmed young children.
[01:55:54.427 --> 01:56:03.972]  You know, we hear the women, but soon I think the next one will be the hysteria regarding children who may have said they've been harmed.
[01:56:03.972 --> 01:56:07.534]  Have you noticed that most of the big players are never identified?
[01:56:07.534 --> 01:56:20.841]  And in the double standard we have, you know, Kavanaugh being under the microscope, but never do we ever go back and say, well maybe we should put Clinton, Bill Clinton to the fire, and all the others who participate in the sexual rituals of Bohemian Grove.
[01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:30.313]  And again, to be clear, Bohemian Grove, for my own research, is just kind of an outer court to see if you like it, to test you out.
[01:56:30.313 --> 01:56:33.314]  Do you have any idea from your research, like, who the different occult groups are?
[01:56:33.314 --> 01:56:37.717]  I mean, we know the things they're into, but it just, it turns into like a labyrinth of mental illness.
[01:56:39.008 --> 01:56:43.130]  Well, I mean, in the beginning, if you remember going back in history, they had the Martinists.
[01:56:43.130 --> 01:56:45.832]  And the Martinists had no morals whatsoever.
[01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:49.333]  They were the secret society that did just that.
[01:56:49.333 --> 01:56:52.115]  It was sexual magic and things of that nature.
[01:56:52.115 --> 01:56:57.958]  Aleister Crowley, of course, was a sex magic provocateur, and he would raise from
[01:56:58.038 --> 01:56:59.499]  Exactly, it's an avatar!
[01:57:27.597 --> 01:57:30.740]  Have an avatar that you'd be abused and have sex with.
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:32.161]  Back in two minutes with Clyde Lewis.
[01:57:32.161 --> 01:57:36.084]  I want to finish up with the occult, which the elite are obsessed with, and get into that avatar.
[01:57:36.084 --> 01:57:38.346]  Then we'll get into the world events and take your phone calls.
[01:57:38.346 --> 01:57:39.647]  I'll give that number up.
[01:57:39.647 --> 01:57:41.669]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:42.890]  Spread those links.
[01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:44.211]  They're trying to censor us for a reason.
[01:57:44.211 --> 01:57:47.634]  They're scared of this broadcast.
[01:57:47.634 --> 01:57:49.976]  InfoWars Live is launching its newest product.
[01:57:49.976 --> 01:57:52.138]  We're really, really proud of it.

[01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:42.269]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:58:42.269 --> 01:58:44.792]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[01:58:44.792 --> 01:58:47.055]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[01:58:48.482 --> 01:58:54.844]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:58:54.844 --> 01:58:58.066]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:58:58.066 --> 01:59:01.767]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:59:01.767 --> 01:59:06.469]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:06.469 --> 01:59:09.750]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.630 --> 01:59:21.619]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.619 --> 01:59:30.166]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:59:31.787 --> 01:59:33.529]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:01.852 --> 02:00:04.213]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.213 --> 02:00:11.257]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.257 --> 02:00:17.821]  Well, Clyde Lewis, big syndicated radio host, obviously, on the Premier Radio Network, comes on every night right before George Noria at 10 p.m.
[02:00:17.821 --> 02:00:19.042]  Central.
[02:00:19.042 --> 02:00:22.924]  It's blowing me away with the occultism of the globalists and what they're into.
[02:00:22.924 --> 02:00:27.227]  And exactly, if you go back to the Jacobins, there was a whole left-hand path
[02:00:27.907 --> 02:00:34.190]  To imitate our revolution, but it was about a nine-day work week and enslaving everyone, but not telling the public it was slavery.
[02:00:34.190 --> 02:00:42.593]  It's kind of the modern model of liberalism, where they know we're all liberal at heart and want to have open, free societies, and, you know, even if we're conservative, you know, we care about freedom.
[02:00:42.593 --> 02:00:45.934]  They say they're all those virtuous things, but they're not.
[02:00:45.934 --> 02:00:54.238]  And then they're all about... Lenin said this, and Anton LaVey said this, you'll have machines and avatars that work for you, and it'll be nothing but pure pleasure.
[02:00:55.148 --> 02:00:58.230]  But when they get control, all they produce is pure hell.
[02:00:58.230 --> 02:01:02.173]  Where do you think we are at this point in history, Clyde Lewis?
[02:01:02.173 --> 02:01:08.338]  Well, we are on the verge of pushing ourselves to the precipice of a new evolution.
[02:01:08.338 --> 02:01:10.720]  It's the new age, they call it.
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:12.722]  It's the golden age.
[02:01:12.722 --> 02:01:17.085]  And they said in the golden age there would be a new man, and the new man would then
[02:01:17.125 --> 02:01:17.846]  We're good
[02:01:40.043 --> 02:01:40.103]  The
[02:02:03.884 --> 02:02:17.048]  Or, we're seeing a fulfillment of what we read in the book of Revelation, the book of Daniel, and this is something that, of course, most Christians, if they're awake, know that this is simply some signs of the times that need to be addressed.
[02:02:17.048 --> 02:02:29.112]  If not, this is certainly a counterfeit attempt at trying to nudge God into the apocalypse, and the most cynical thing mankind can do is to fake his own prophecies and also to fake his own second coming.
[02:02:29.492 --> 02:02:43.230]  So, if this is going on, that is the most diabolical thing I think the elite can do, is to actually fool people into believing that the power relies in mankind and their ability to become more like machines, rather than becoming more human.
[02:02:46.843 --> 02:02:55.089]  I'm just sitting back here, Clyde, trying to figure this out myself because I just want prosperity and a good future and to build a great future for humanity.
[02:02:55.089 --> 02:03:01.313]  But like you said, it's programmed into us something from before.
[02:03:01.313 --> 02:03:07.257]  And obviously, I don't think humans in our current form originate from this planet.
[02:03:07.257 --> 02:03:12.380]  You've got the way they distort the Bible and the way the preacher is twisted or whatever, but you've got the previous creation the Bible talks about.
[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:13.741]  I believe the Bible is real.
[02:03:13.741 --> 02:03:15.983]  I just believe the interpretations get twisted of men.
[02:03:16.543 --> 02:03:21.185]  But the globalists are like clearly trying to suppress humans becoming something.
[02:03:21.185 --> 02:03:28.108]  The fluoride, the vaccines, attacking families, attacking high IQs, attacking real spiritual connections.
[02:03:28.108 --> 02:03:32.010]  I mean, I think we probably agree they're trying to suppress something.
[02:03:32.010 --> 02:03:33.631]  So A, is that true?
[02:03:33.631 --> 02:03:34.271]  B, what is it?
[02:03:35.396 --> 02:03:40.058]  What they're doing is they're certainly concerned about consciousness.
[02:03:40.058 --> 02:03:47.141]  They're looking into things like panpsychism and they're wondering, why is it that we have the type of consciousness we have?
[02:03:47.141 --> 02:03:49.122]  What is it that makes us who we are?
[02:03:49.122 --> 02:03:58.926]  They're tapping into the brain, they're looking into the DNA, they're using DNA and they're using brain signals to try and determine how the algorithms
[02:03:59.306 --> 02:04:11.672]  It's almost like the planet is a laboratory for an advanced species, and lower level aliens have gotten an advanced species, but kept it in a baby state to try to test it in war game to like beat it somewhere else.
[02:04:11.672 --> 02:04:18.935]  And I'm not even, I'm not saying I believe that, just that a gut level extension, the Bible, all the eschatology, all the archetypes, it seems that's what it is.
[02:04:19.755 --> 02:04:34.787]  Well, I've been covering lately the stories that have been coming out of science lately about what is known as synthetic intelligence, where they are now determining that many of the relationships now, if you want to go here, here's what, this is something even more peculiar.
[02:04:35.187 --> 02:04:52.612]  The relationships we've had in the past with so-called aliens have been nothing more than relationships we've had with thousands of year old synthetic intelligence, where the synthetic intelligence has been in the background controlling everything from the very beginning, meaning... Sure, AI was already here.
[02:04:52.612 --> 02:04:56.553]  Let's talk about it straight ahead.
[02:04:56.553 --> 02:05:00.454]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:05:01.818 --> 02:05:10.500]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:12.461]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:05:12.461 --> 02:05:15.922]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:05:15.922 --> 02:05:18.562]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:05:18.562 --> 02:05:20.843]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:05:20.843 --> 02:05:27.785]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[02:05:28.365 --> 02:05:38.133]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:05:38.133 --> 02:05:39.335]  We'll win.
[02:05:39.335 --> 02:05:42.177]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[02:05:42.177 --> 02:05:49.383]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[02:05:49.383 --> 02:05:53.086]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globals may win.
[02:05:53.086 --> 02:05:54.648]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[02:05:54.648 --> 02:05:55.308]  We need your support.
[02:05:55.308 --> 02:05:56.049]  I'm counting on you.
[02:06:07.113 --> 02:06:10.986]  We got to have an ace in the hole.
[02:06:10.986 --> 02:06:13.394]  A little secret that nobody knows.
[02:06:26.548 --> 02:06:30.469]  Well, I love getting Clyde Lewis on because I had no idea where this would go.
[02:06:30.469 --> 02:06:37.830]  I mean, I wanted to bring up Kavanaugh, and I wanted to bring up, you know, he predicted a Rison attack, and then we got into the occult and the globalist, which is absolutely true.
[02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:39.831]  We're getting into AI and all this, and...
[02:06:40.831 --> 02:06:58.101]  You know, people like Tim Cook, the owner, or the head of Apple, biggest corporation in the world, who, there's a video on Infowars.com titled, Tim Cook, Most Dangerous Man in the World, because he's the guy getting all the other tech to go censorship, he's in China, helping censor things, so is Google.
[02:06:58.101 --> 02:07:04.585]  Thank God the Pentagon and others are waking up to this, but, Floyd Lewis, it does seem like it's all happened before.
[02:07:04.585 --> 02:07:08.047]  And like, we're out here in the middle of this galaxy, out in the boondocks,
[02:07:09.451 --> 02:07:13.976]  And that everything the globalists do is a scientific mad scientist test.
[02:07:13.976 --> 02:07:17.479]  No matter what country it is or group, they're building towards something larger.
[02:07:17.479 --> 02:07:19.682]  And like you said, it's in a...
[02:07:20.942 --> 02:07:30.704]  Internet of the mind broadcast, in that there's this knowledge of evil, the Bible talks about the mystery of evil, where the evil works together, it's being directed.
[02:07:30.704 --> 02:07:42.507]  And so this doesn't disagree with the Bible, it confirms it, and then you look at the globalists all obsessed with the occult, and then obsessed with building this AI system, but the AI system, like you said, is already there.
[02:07:42.507 --> 02:07:45.588]  It's telling them what to build, with tentacles and nodes,
[02:07:46.502 --> 02:07:49.164]  Like, Palantir's to watch everything we're doing.
[02:07:49.164 --> 02:08:00.671]  So we're building something, an artificial limited omnipresence on this planet, in their own words, to then direct human development to build something next.
[02:08:00.671 --> 02:08:11.459]  And it's teaching us we should die and fall away, and this next thing is the future, which obviously would be like an enemy transmission, that you're scum, you're crap, this thing's coming, lay down and die, but build it for me first.
[02:08:11.459 --> 02:08:16.022]  I mean, people think about science fiction, a bunch of flying saucers landing, like Mars Attacks.
[02:08:16.682 --> 02:08:18.244]  But no, that's not the way this happens.
[02:08:18.244 --> 02:08:21.106]  It's like the Bible says, it's interdimensional.
[02:08:21.106 --> 02:08:23.168]  Well, and you look at what the future holds.
[02:08:23.168 --> 02:08:26.631]  I mean, you're talking about the singularity where computers become smarter than humans.
[02:08:26.631 --> 02:08:33.458]  I mean, the closest thing we have to the singularity right now is the blockchain, which is a ledger that continues to grow and grow and grow and grow.
[02:08:33.458 --> 02:08:37.261]  And what it developed was a way to actually get humans to make it grow bigger.
[02:08:37.261 --> 02:08:39.383]  And that was cryptocurrency.
[02:08:39.383 --> 02:08:41.305]  The thing about cryptocurrency is
[02:08:41.685 --> 02:08:46.769]  You make money actually with things like Bitcoin and other things.
[02:08:46.769 --> 02:08:51.372]  And what it is, is it's the blockchain basically feeding us what we like.
[02:08:51.372 --> 02:08:56.476]  The blockchain realizes, hey, these humans who want to build me up, they like money.
[02:08:56.476 --> 02:08:59.318]  I'll give them money and they'll continue to watch me grow.
[02:08:59.318 --> 02:09:02.821]  And so what we're literally constructing is our own form of mammon.
[02:09:02.821 --> 02:09:09.746]  We have the mammon demon with regard to the blockchain, which is holding us all hostage with the money and the decisions with the Internet of Things.
[02:09:10.126 --> 02:09:15.628]  We have a social credit system that's going to be employed, brought to us by China.
[02:09:15.628 --> 02:09:24.991]  Google right now is doing something called Operation Dragonfly, which they're preparing us for a social credit system.
[02:09:24.991 --> 02:09:27.451]  What this is, is it's full spectrum control, Alex.
[02:09:27.451 --> 02:09:28.872]  That is the end game.
[02:09:29.352 --> 02:09:29.552]  Well,
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:49.441]  We're going to be sprinkling everywhere like confetti.
[02:09:49.441 --> 02:09:54.784]  And of course, China has developed some really amazing things in nanotechnology.
[02:09:54.784 --> 02:09:57.085]  Sure, the original name 20 years ago was smart dust.
[02:09:57.085 --> 02:09:58.546]  He's calling it evil dust.
[02:09:58.546 --> 02:10:01.607]  And then it's just little markers that they can run around and scan and read.
[02:10:01.607 --> 02:10:06.510]  And then China's putting spy tech in all the phones and we're letting it in and then we're doing it to them.
[02:10:06.510 --> 02:10:10.012]  And it's all just a race for the AI, but we lose everything in the process.
[02:10:10.839 --> 02:10:18.226]  Yeah, I mean, we become, and a lot of people don't know this, but the nanoparticles have already been released, and we have them in our bodies.
[02:10:18.226 --> 02:10:19.607]  We just don't know we have them.
[02:10:19.607 --> 02:10:27.314]  It's binary, just like they told us in the Singularity movie, or what it was called with Johnny Depp, like, oh, he's the good AI, and he's in the atmosphere now.
[02:10:28.447 --> 02:10:40.272]  Right, and so, you know, pretty much everything from the blade of grass you stand on to your animals to even what's inside of you is going to be marked and catalogued with your own little number called your social credit score.
[02:10:40.272 --> 02:10:43.374]  But we can't cure cancer, and by the way, it's way up.
[02:10:43.374 --> 02:10:44.254]  We're killing you.
[02:10:44.254 --> 02:10:45.895]  We have all this, but we can't cure it.
[02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:49.332]  Well it's not good for business and they said so.
[02:10:49.332 --> 02:11:09.033]  The Wall Street and my wife just went through breast cancer surgery and we did a show called the Cancer Cash Cow and what we talked about was that you know Wall Street actually came out and said well we found a cure for hepatitis and it wasn't good for business and and so we got to keep a lid on any cures for cancer.
[02:11:09.633 --> 02:11:20.558]  And in the meantime they have enough money to create biomarker drugs and biomarker biological weapons that they can release on everybody and kill certain groups of the population based on their DNA.
[02:11:20.558 --> 02:11:30.702]  Things like 23andMe and Ancestry, that's all about collecting DNA that they can use against us in the future using biological weapons and eliminating certain members of the population.
[02:11:30.922 --> 02:11:32.263]  Sure, and it's been confirmed.
[02:11:32.263 --> 02:11:35.744]  Those groups reportedly don't give you your real DNA breakdown.
[02:11:35.744 --> 02:11:40.766]  They just create a scrambled thing and then add in some things you're not even to create the PSYOP.
[02:11:40.766 --> 02:11:42.867]  And again, nothing against being part African.
[02:11:42.867 --> 02:11:44.648]  That's great, that's wonderful.
[02:11:44.648 --> 02:11:49.070]  But now they've done genetic testing in Asia and all over and it's not actually what they say.
[02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.770]  Everybody 100% from one area.
[02:11:51.411 --> 02:11:55.012]  Please add 6% Africa into those tests.
[02:11:55.012 --> 02:11:56.713]  And again, it's a lie.
[02:11:56.713 --> 02:12:01.355]  And nothing against being part African, it's that they're not telling us who we really are.
[02:12:01.355 --> 02:12:08.838]  Clearly three different groups on the planet, interrelated, but in some like weird sports game or something that somebody set up.
[02:12:09.622 --> 02:12:20.132]  What they're doing right now is they're taking that DNA information, they're shipping it to the Republic of Georgia at a place called the Lugar Center, and they're concocting some biological package.
[02:12:20.132 --> 02:12:20.493]  No, you're right.
[02:12:20.493 --> 02:12:31.063]  They've been going for race-specific bioweapons that Dick Cheney talked about, but they need a giant spectrum of blood and tissue samples to index it, to come up with one that they can specifically use against certain groups.
[02:12:32.034 --> 02:12:36.596]  Right, and so they're taking it to this center called the Lugar Center and they're synthesizing it at this center.
[02:12:36.596 --> 02:12:43.778]  The Russians are angry about it because what they're doing is they're putting all of this biological pathogen in mosquitoes and other insects.
[02:12:43.778 --> 02:12:44.719]  They're releasing them.
[02:12:44.719 --> 02:12:46.459]  And that's Bill Gates.
[02:12:46.459 --> 02:12:47.360]  I'm glad you bring this up.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:48.380]  What is up with Bill Gates?
[02:12:49.574 --> 02:12:54.037]  Well, Bill Gates knows that one of the best carriers of pathogen is a mosquito.
[02:12:54.037 --> 02:13:00.801]  In fact, at a TED Talk, he released them to people and he said, hey, be lucky it doesn't have typhoid or typhus in it.
[02:13:00.801 --> 02:13:04.943]  And then we have the outbreak of typhoid and typhus in Los Angeles with the fleas.
[02:13:04.943 --> 02:13:06.124]  With rats.
[02:13:06.124 --> 02:13:07.565]  And of course, and rats.
[02:13:07.565 --> 02:13:10.666]  And we have all the other problems with people coming over the border bringing diseases.
[02:13:10.666 --> 02:13:11.187]  Exactly!
[02:13:11.187 --> 02:13:12.968]  There is a war against civilization.
[02:13:14.656 --> 02:13:21.079]  Well, and they're going to use what they, like what Kevin Kissinger said with his document in 1974.
[02:13:21.079 --> 02:13:24.161]  We've got to make it look natural.
[02:13:24.161 --> 02:13:29.804]  We have to bring about some sort of a famine, some sort of a crisis where we're lacking in resources.
[02:13:29.804 --> 02:13:35.386]  In the meantime, we're gathering the resources and leaving the peasants to starve and fight over a crust of bread.
[02:13:35.386 --> 02:13:39.868]  In the meantime, they're sick, they're divided, and they're easy to conquer in that regard.
[02:13:39.868 --> 02:13:42.070]  And so that's why I was determined... No, I totally agree.
[02:13:42.070 --> 02:13:42.790]  So let me ask you this.
[02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:44.291]  And I want to come back and take calls.
[02:13:44.291 --> 02:13:45.231]  What do we do, Cly?
[02:13:45.231 --> 02:13:46.812]  Because I'm not just kissing your butt.
[02:13:46.812 --> 02:13:49.433]  You really are one of the people I know that's really dialed in full spectrum.
[02:13:49.433 --> 02:13:51.473]  Like, you're reminding me of stuff I forgot about.
[02:13:51.473 --> 02:13:54.535]  Like, world government bioweapon labs the Rockefellers run.
[02:13:54.535 --> 02:13:56.575]  Cold Springs Harbor built in Georgia.
[02:13:56.575 --> 02:13:58.256]  Russians threatening to attack the facility.
[02:13:58.256 --> 02:13:59.176]  This is real.
[02:13:59.176 --> 02:13:59.977]  I mean, it's what I mean.
[02:13:59.977 --> 02:14:01.557]  It's just like, crazy town!
[02:14:01.557 --> 02:14:02.438]  Like, whoa!
[02:14:02.438 --> 02:14:03.798]  We're on this planet!
[02:14:03.798 --> 02:14:05.059]  And like, there's this race.
[02:14:05.059 --> 02:14:06.599]  Like, who's supposed to get control?
[02:14:06.599 --> 02:14:08.740]  Because something else comes after it.
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:10.681]  And I can't get the average man I know to quit going,
[02:14:11.181 --> 02:14:17.723]  I'm tough and women just want to get collagen injections in their lips and like the whole future's just racing ahead of us.
[02:14:17.723 --> 02:14:24.024]  The globalists have decided they've already, like you said, put binary nanotech weapons in all of us to kill our asses.
[02:14:24.024 --> 02:14:27.785]  H1N1, ten years ago they admitted was a bio-tracker weapon.
[02:14:27.785 --> 02:14:31.666]  If it's a binary for the next one, that's in major medical literature.
[02:14:31.666 --> 02:14:37.488]  It's like they're putting in vaccines, nano-flu, that down the road they give you another flu and it kills 99%.
[02:14:38.968 --> 02:14:39.648]  Exactly!
[02:14:39.648 --> 02:14:47.353]  We're on the edge of total extermination, and the average dumbass goes, oh, you better shut up, they'll ban you on Facebook.
[02:14:47.353 --> 02:14:50.334]  Well, yeah, I mean, the culling process is underway.
[02:14:50.334 --> 02:14:54.677]  I have to genocide when you're getting, you know, drugs from your doctors that are killing you.
[02:14:54.677 --> 02:15:02.661]  And then, not only that, but we have these pathogens that, you know, if it was a Middle Eastern country developing these pathogens in a rogue lab, we'd be bombing them tomorrow.
[02:15:02.981 --> 02:15:05.342]  Here in the United States we do it, and no one cares.
[02:15:05.342 --> 02:15:07.363]  We do it in the Republic of Georgia.
[02:15:07.363 --> 02:15:10.424]  Russia gets all stinky about it, and everybody's like, well, what do they know?
[02:15:10.424 --> 02:15:25.091]  Well, they know that the next biological weapons attack is going to be, and I don't understand why nobody is covering this, because, you know, what that man did, William Clyde, he attempted a decapitation exercise using ricin.
[02:15:27.008 --> 02:15:28.488]  I'll get into that later if you want.
[02:15:28.488 --> 02:15:35.650]  That, you know, we saw it coming and you and I had talked about this gain-of-function exercise.
[02:15:35.650 --> 02:15:40.071]  When that Emirates plane landed in New York on 9-11, it was 9-11 a.m.
[02:15:40.071 --> 02:15:45.812]  when it landed, and those people on that plane were sick, I believe that they were poisoned.
[02:15:45.812 --> 02:15:48.813]  Oh yeah, I was talking about all these aircraft with people deadly sick on them.
[02:15:48.813 --> 02:15:50.933]  Are there really bio-attacks taking place?
[02:15:50.933 --> 02:15:52.914]  But I'm giving the number out when we come back.
[02:15:55.419 --> 02:15:58.341]  Never wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[02:15:58.341 --> 02:16:03.245]  Vercell Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.
[02:16:03.245 --> 02:16:08.830]  Decentralized blockchain solutions are making the world more transparent and giving power back to the people.
[02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:17.077]  Vercell Media has helped companies raise tens of millions in the past year alone, structuring and marketing ICOs to the thirsty crypto public worldwide.
[02:16:17.077 --> 02:16:19.539]  Don't miss the cryptocurrency revolution.
[02:16:19.539 --> 02:16:21.580]  Visit vercellmedia.com.
[02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:23.642]  V-E-R-C-E-L-Media.com.
[02:16:25.441 --> 02:16:26.661]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:26.661 --> 02:16:30.583]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.583 --> 02:16:32.123]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:32.123 --> 02:16:35.084]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:35.084 --> 02:16:40.286]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:40.646 --> 02:16:41.847]  I can help you too.

[02:17:24.804 --> 02:17:31.149]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.149 --> 02:17:34.192]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.192 --> 02:17:40.116]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.116 --> 02:17:43.919]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.919 --> 02:17:45.180]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:46.522]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.522 --> 02:17:52.727]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.727 --> 02:17:54.148]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.385 --> 02:18:00.508]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.

[02:18:56.263 --> 02:19:04.806]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.806 --> 02:19:06.026]  Believe me, I know.
[02:19:06.026 --> 02:19:10.967]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.967 --> 02:19:15.949]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:19:16.189 --> 02:19:36.336]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:20:00.037 --> 02:20:02.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.932 --> 02:20:19.094]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.094 --> 02:20:21.036]  Because there is a war on.
[02:20:21.036 --> 02:20:23.878]  For your mind.
[02:20:23.878 --> 02:20:25.660]  Well, make no mistake.
[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:28.322]  There's a lot of stuff going on on this planet we don't know about.
[02:20:28.322 --> 02:20:30.764]  And the people that run it are really pissed about the President.
[02:20:30.764 --> 02:20:32.266]  It's not, oh, anger.
[02:20:32.266 --> 02:20:34.728]  There's a fight.
[02:20:34.728 --> 02:20:36.970]  And Trump's turned the oxygen back on to the West.
[02:20:38.493 --> 02:20:42.576]  And the establishment that's been running us down is really pissed off.
[02:20:42.576 --> 02:20:45.278]  Because Trump's promoting a pro-human future.
[02:20:45.278 --> 02:20:48.920]  And saying, we've got secret technology, we're going to unleash the secrets of the universe.
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:52.743]  We're going to release all these drugs and treatments they've been suppressing, because you know, that's what they do.
[02:20:52.743 --> 02:20:54.924]  I told you at the inauguration he'd do that.
[02:20:54.924 --> 02:20:56.906]  The New York Times asked me, how did you know what he'd talk about?
[02:20:56.906 --> 02:20:57.446]  I just knew.
[02:20:57.446 --> 02:20:59.387]  Clyde Lewis is our guest.
[02:20:59.387 --> 02:21:00.368]  We're taking your calls.
[02:21:00.368 --> 02:21:01.449]  Next segment, 877-789-2539 on Kavanaugh on AI.
[02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:08.892]  On world government.
[02:21:08.892 --> 02:21:09.633]  On the occult.
[02:21:09.633 --> 02:21:11.915]  And I'll be here tomorrow.
[02:21:11.915 --> 02:21:16.099]  A live feed at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:21:16.099 --> 02:21:17.881]  An hour before the vote.
[02:21:17.881 --> 02:21:21.544]  It's set under law 30 hours after cloture.
[02:21:21.544 --> 02:21:22.725]  Could be earlier.
[02:21:22.725 --> 02:21:23.907]  Could be right for the line.
[02:21:23.907 --> 02:21:24.988]  That's at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:21:24.988 --> 02:21:28.431]  So we'll be up here tomorrow at like 2 o'clock or so.
[02:21:28.431 --> 02:21:29.212]  A few hours before.
[02:21:29.212 --> 02:21:30.133]  We'll be watching it.
[02:21:31.271 --> 02:21:32.313]  We'll go live.
[02:21:32.313 --> 02:21:34.476]  We've got reporters in DC.
[02:21:34.476 --> 02:21:36.840]  For security reasons, I'm not going to say who yet.
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:38.943]  Infowars.com, before it's last show.
[02:21:38.943 --> 02:21:40.526]  Infowars.com, the main page.
[02:21:40.526 --> 02:21:42.689]  And the power of you, knowing they're trying to block us.
[02:21:43.581 --> 02:21:51.829]  Going and getting that live feed off InfoWars, Angers, Google, and Facebook, and Apple, because you send that link out, it's our feed, it's our system.
[02:21:51.829 --> 02:21:56.594]  Guess how much our bandwidth went up a month just in video streams?
[02:21:56.594 --> 02:21:58.496]  It went from like $50,000 a month to $105,000 in September.
[02:22:06.235 --> 02:22:08.457]  And the crew was like, you want us to stop this, boss?
[02:22:08.457 --> 02:22:09.358]  You want us to quit?
[02:22:09.358 --> 02:22:12.562]  They're taking the player and it's posted on hundreds and hundreds of websites.
[02:22:12.562 --> 02:22:13.483]  It's going everywhere.
[02:22:13.483 --> 02:22:14.244]  People are watching it.
[02:22:14.244 --> 02:22:17.627]  But my God, I said, yeah, that's what we're doing.
[02:22:17.627 --> 02:22:19.029]  Now let's try to get some cheaper bandwidth.
[02:22:19.029 --> 02:22:21.451]  But that's why we sell products and doing this.
[02:22:21.451 --> 02:22:23.574]  I mean, you know, when you've got
[02:22:26.368 --> 02:22:31.029]  A multi-hundred percent increase just in folks on Infowars.com watching and listening on our streams.
[02:22:31.029 --> 02:22:34.010]  That's exciting, so keep it going, but by the products.
[02:22:34.010 --> 02:22:41.172]  Going back to Clyde Lewis, host of Ground Zero on Premier Radio Networks, 10 to 2 in the morning Central.
[02:22:41.172 --> 02:22:50.474]  Clyde, I want to go to Carl's next segment, but just other big points you want to make about what's happening, the decision humanity has to make, the things we're doing, what you see coming in the future.
[02:22:51.909 --> 02:22:56.870]  Well, the big decision mankind has to make is whether or not they want to be ruled by algorithms and machines.
[02:22:56.870 --> 02:23:05.812]  The reason why I think people are becoming more irritable and aggravated is because they don't realize that they're being controlled by the invisible algorithms on computers.
[02:23:05.812 --> 02:23:12.234]  Oh, all the studies show it's lowering IQ, it's destroying relationships, and it's making us depressed, and it's designed to!
[02:23:13.581 --> 02:23:18.307]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, the computer's not only reading your mind, it's making choices for you now.
[02:23:18.307 --> 02:23:26.999]  And as much as it advances, you realize that it looks... Machines, when they get enough intelligence, they'll realize just how much of a threat we are.
[02:23:26.999 --> 02:23:28.241]  They know that we can turn them off.
[02:23:28.661 --> 02:23:36.367]  And so just unleashing them the way they do and not having control of them is something that Elon Musk told us about.
[02:23:36.367 --> 02:23:40.491]  I mean, hell, they've got the D-Wave computer now that has a heartbeat for crying out loud.
[02:23:40.491 --> 02:23:44.875]  And Jordy Rose, the man who put Kindred together, said, well, guess what we have, guys?
[02:23:44.875 --> 02:23:53.762]  We have a computer that is literally capable of opening up a portal and bringing through what would be considered the same creatures that H.P.
[02:23:53.762 --> 02:23:54.863]  Lovecraft talked about.
[02:23:55.143 --> 02:23:56.804]  And I'm thinking, are you kidding me?
[02:23:56.804 --> 02:23:59.545]  I mean, he said that during a TED Talk.
[02:23:59.545 --> 02:24:10.349]  And I was like, oh, they have the ability to rip open time-space itself and bring through it demons or whatever they want to bring through to try and get it to perform the way they want it to.
[02:24:10.349 --> 02:24:12.029]  And it's going to backfire eventually.
[02:24:12.029 --> 02:24:20.532]  And one day we're going to learn that we should not be doing what we're doing and abusing our power and using... Well, that's very astute what you said.
[02:24:20.532 --> 02:24:22.433]  And let's say those things interdimensionally aren't there.
[02:24:23.390 --> 02:24:36.713]  They believe they're getting a divine assistance, divine influence, divine, what's the term, where you get basically the idea to do some art or literature, the inspiration.
[02:24:36.713 --> 02:24:46.796]  But what type of psychos say we're looking for interdimensional demons to take over and take over the machines and rule us, then that shows they're totally projecting a psychotic view.
[02:24:48.464 --> 02:24:51.925]  Well, it's because they want to hand the power over to what is known as a Synarchy.
[02:24:51.925 --> 02:24:57.466]  The Synarchy has always been the divine rule from the shadows, the hidden hand.
[02:24:57.466 --> 02:24:59.746]  And, you know, man has taken that mantle.
[02:24:59.746 --> 02:25:01.507]  Some of the elite have taken that mantle.
[02:25:01.507 --> 02:25:05.168]  But, of course, now they no longer want the mantle given to themselves.
[02:25:05.168 --> 02:25:08.148]  They want to put the honor back into unknown gods.
[02:25:08.148 --> 02:25:11.749]  Something that was talked about in the Bible is what the Antichrist would do in the future.
[02:25:11.749 --> 02:25:15.650]  And they believe they get power out of planetary suicide.
[02:25:16.681 --> 02:25:17.302]  Pretty much.
[02:25:17.302 --> 02:25:22.468]  I mean, they have no consideration for humankind.
[02:25:22.468 --> 02:25:30.378]  They believe that their calling and election is made sure on some other planet or some other dimension, and so therefore they're willing to take us all with them.
[02:25:30.378 --> 02:25:31.680]  And we have no choice.
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:32.821]  And we do have a choice.
[02:25:32.821 --> 02:25:34.844]  We just have to be aware now how it begins.
[02:25:34.844 --> 02:25:35.585]  If you want to know
[02:25:36.025 --> 02:25:42.469]  What the future holds electronically, you need to read Zbigniew Brzezinski's book about the technotronic era.
[02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:49.614]  And I even have a book out called Transhuman Substantiation, the truth about AI and the singularity that's out right now on Amazon.
[02:25:49.614 --> 02:25:51.656]  And I started writing in 2016.
[02:25:51.656 --> 02:26:01.462]  And I said in 2016, I said the biggest unfortunate event is, is that our candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are not talking about the innovations that can just up and kill us one day.
[02:26:01.462 --> 02:26:04.524]  And we're already exponentially moving quicker through the...
[02:26:05.845 --> 02:26:08.448]  Well they said, you know, don't take away our ability to play God.
[02:26:08.448 --> 02:26:10.711]  If you get in our way, we'll kill you.
[02:26:22.436 --> 02:26:23.376]  They've said that before.
[02:26:23.376 --> 02:26:26.497]  They've said things like, look, we're playing God.
[02:26:26.497 --> 02:26:27.557]  Get over it.
[02:26:27.557 --> 02:26:31.538]  We want to play God because we have the power, ability and knowledge to play God.
[02:26:31.538 --> 02:26:33.919]  And that, of course, is a Luciferian idea.
[02:26:33.919 --> 02:26:37.800]  The Luciferian idea is God doesn't exist.
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:39.680]  So therefore, I'm going to be God.
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:43.661]  And that is exactly what Ray Kurzweil, the head of Future Projects for Google, said.
[02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:46.482]  He said, I don't believe in God yet.
[02:26:46.482 --> 02:26:48.503]  And he said, yeah, we may not destroy him.
[02:26:48.503 --> 02:26:49.363]  He'll be like a roach.
[02:26:49.363 --> 02:26:50.303]  We may step on you.
[02:26:52.031 --> 02:26:54.033]  You don't need to destroy God to get rid of God.
[02:26:54.033 --> 02:26:56.234]  You just need to ignore God to get rid of God.
[02:26:56.234 --> 02:26:58.356]  That's one of the things that Joseph Campbell said.
[02:26:58.356 --> 02:27:00.698]  He said, you know why nobody worships Zeus anymore?
[02:27:00.698 --> 02:27:02.879]  It's because we ignored Zeus.
[02:27:02.879 --> 02:27:13.648]  But yet again, you've got people like Macron, the French president, who when Donald Trump spoke out against globalism, he said, I'm willing to take over the reins of power of the UN.
[02:27:13.648 --> 02:27:21.614]  And before he was elected in France, he said, I want to rule France like Jupiter, which of course is the equivalent of Zeus, which is the God above our God.
[02:27:22.074 --> 02:27:27.116]  Zeus is the Greek, the Roman counterpart, the same God as Jupiter.
[02:27:27.116 --> 02:27:29.957]  He's saying, I am Zeus, these people are crazy!
[02:27:29.957 --> 02:27:39.260]  Yeah, and you look in the Bible, Pergamon is the Satan's seat, and it's the Satan's seat of Jupiter, which was actually rebuilt in Berlin.
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:42.782]  And really they're a bunch of megalomaniac
[02:27:58.032 --> 02:28:04.717]  Crazy people that don't know they're already connected to God, and they're just delusional they're going to have all this power when we already have been given all the power by God.
[02:28:04.717 --> 02:28:07.800]  Phone calls on Kavanaugh and so much more.
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:11.162]  With Clyde Lewis, straight ahead, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:28:11.162 --> 02:28:14.385]  Remember, they're working around the clock to stop those sites from getting out.
[02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:22.010]  When you email them, when you tell people personally about Infowars.com, and here's the forbidden show, and here's the topics they don't want you to know about, it's powerful.
[02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:23.552]  It overrides the machines.
[02:28:23.552 --> 02:28:24.953]  It changes the world.
[02:28:24.953 --> 02:28:27.755]  Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com.
[02:28:28.135 --> 02:28:29.236]  Get those links out.

[02:28:56.932 --> 02:29:00.854]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.854 --> 02:29:02.395]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.395 --> 02:29:05.357]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.357 --> 02:29:10.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:12.120]  I can help you, too.

[02:32:59.479 --> 02:33:02.140]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.956 --> 02:33:25.821]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:25.821 --> 02:33:43.938]  Alright, I'm going to go like your phone calls here in a few minutes, but Clyde Lewis really is breaking down amazing information here today.
[02:33:43.938 --> 02:33:44.919]  And I want to ask him,
[02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:52.983]  This global awakening we see, I think, is in response, like Newtonian physics, to the huge oppression that's here.
[02:33:52.983 --> 02:33:59.688]  But what do you think, spend a few minutes, we're going to go to calls, people can do to not get down about this?
[02:33:59.688 --> 02:34:04.971]  Because, I mean, I think knowing it's happening is positive, even though a lot of it's negative.
[02:34:04.971 --> 02:34:08.073]  So I'm not here trying to, years ago I was told by folks,
[02:34:09.465 --> 02:34:10.866]  Affiliated with the Globalist Off-Record.
[02:34:10.866 --> 02:34:12.126]  Oh, Jones, thanks a lot.
[02:34:12.126 --> 02:34:13.427]  You're just demoralizing people for us.
[02:34:13.427 --> 02:34:14.548]  Ha ha ha.
[02:34:14.548 --> 02:34:17.650]  They'd rather you not be awake, but if you're going to be awake, they think it scares people.
[02:34:17.650 --> 02:34:22.352]  No, I think, if I get a call, my neighbor goes, hey, your house is on fire, your car's on fire outside.
[02:34:22.352 --> 02:34:25.474]  I go, thanks, Bob, and I run out and try to put it out.
[02:34:25.474 --> 02:34:32.458]  I'm not like, pissed I know the bad news, but I believe in humanity, and I believe if they know this stuff, they'll do something.
[02:34:33.866 --> 02:34:38.370]  So I don't want to just sit up here and go, oh my god, there's interdimensional evil and all this stuff.
[02:34:38.370 --> 02:34:39.670]  The good news is it's a test.
[02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:41.011]  I think we know what's happening.
[02:34:41.011 --> 02:34:43.854]  I think evil's freaking out because it realizes we're waking up.
[02:34:43.854 --> 02:34:46.916]  Or maybe I'm wrong, but isn't it best to know, period?
[02:34:48.553 --> 02:34:50.995]  Well, it's best to know, and it's also best to have the dialogue.
[02:34:50.995 --> 02:35:00.081]  I mean, the most valuable thing about what you do, and what I do, and several other shows like yours and mine do, is we develop the dialogue that is completely ignored.
[02:35:00.081 --> 02:35:03.183]  I've always said that it's exclusion that will do us in.
[02:35:03.183 --> 02:35:08.226]  Anything that's excluded, they'll exclude, the media will exclude certain things so people don't know about it.
[02:35:08.226 --> 02:35:16.712]  But the truth is, is that the snicker factor on a lot of this is gone, because as clichéd as it may sound, we are living now in the future.
[02:35:16.712 --> 02:35:18.473]  And the way things are with the computers,
[02:35:18.473 --> 02:35:19.094]  Yes, we are.
[02:35:36.008 --> 02:35:37.129]  Life is worth living.
[02:35:37.129 --> 02:35:39.571]  You've got to say to yourself, my life has meaning.
[02:35:39.571 --> 02:35:42.933]  I have to go out and I have to do this for my kids and my grandkids.
[02:35:42.933 --> 02:35:45.695]  And you have to stop thinking that it's not going to affect you.
[02:35:45.695 --> 02:35:46.975]  It's going to affect you.
[02:35:46.975 --> 02:35:54.140]  And even though we talk about the internet of things, we talk about technology, people say, well, I'll go live off the grid somewhere in the forest.
[02:35:54.140 --> 02:35:59.203]  You're still going to be affected because if they're going to be spraying that smart dust everywhere, they're going to know where you're going.
[02:35:59.203 --> 02:36:04.647]  You think that test they did on the phones the other day was just because to inform you that there's going to be an actual emergency?
[02:36:05.067 --> 02:36:07.027]  No, they did a lot with those phones.
[02:36:07.027 --> 02:36:18.030]  They were able to know where you were, they were able to track everywhere, and they took over the phone and they took it over for just a few seconds to see and run data on all of it.
[02:36:18.030 --> 02:36:26.731]  And a lot of people, in fact here in the Northwest where I'm at, a lot of their phones didn't work for a good two minutes.
[02:36:26.731 --> 02:36:28.452]  Clyde, expand on that.
[02:36:28.452 --> 02:36:30.052]  Why do you think they're attacking Infowars so much?
[02:36:31.377 --> 02:36:35.358]  Well, they were attacking Infowars because of the fact that you did a no-no, Alex.
[02:36:35.358 --> 02:36:38.919]  You basically spoke against the state.
[02:36:38.919 --> 02:36:48.981]  And it's always been an American... It's actually been an American thing to actually speak against the state.
[02:36:48.981 --> 02:36:58.483]  If we see tyranny, or we warn of tyranny, or we warn of the Constitution being trampled upon, it's our duty as American citizens to actually call it.
[02:36:58.923 --> 02:37:06.749]  And it just really bothered me that for the longest time I was saying, hey, we need due process of law being carried out no matter how we look at a person.
[02:37:06.749 --> 02:37:09.371]  Even scumbags deserve due process.
[02:37:09.371 --> 02:37:11.112]  And I was always like, oh, Clyde, you're wrong.
[02:37:11.112 --> 02:37:13.374]  You know, if they're guilty, they're guilty.
[02:37:13.374 --> 02:37:15.596]  No, you go to a court of law and you carry it out.
[02:37:15.596 --> 02:37:18.197]  Hell, we tried the Nazis in a court of law.
[02:37:18.197 --> 02:37:20.479]  We tried Saddam Hussein in a court of law.
[02:37:20.479 --> 02:37:22.941]  Everybody deserves a trial of due process.
[02:37:22.941 --> 02:37:25.563]  But then when it comes to Kavanaugh, everybody's like going,
[02:37:25.883 --> 02:37:26.504]  Oh my God!
[02:37:26.504 --> 02:37:27.424]  No due process!
[02:37:27.424 --> 02:37:28.325]  No due process!
[02:37:28.325 --> 02:37:34.810]  Well, you should have thought of that back when we were trampling all over the Constitution with regards to due process.
[02:37:34.810 --> 02:37:36.392]  First Amendment rights.
[02:37:36.392 --> 02:37:37.333]  Second Amendment rights.
[02:37:37.333 --> 02:37:40.295]  There are amendments beyond the First and Second Amendment.
[02:37:40.295 --> 02:37:41.776]  And people need to understand that.
[02:37:41.776 --> 02:37:43.037]  Search and seizure.
[02:37:43.037 --> 02:37:44.618]  Incrimination with the Fifth Amendment.
[02:37:45.839 --> 02:37:51.742]  You know, we deserve due process, a jury of our peers, and not expensive bails in jail.
[02:37:51.742 --> 02:38:00.366]  These things are unconstitutional, but yet we let them slide, and we need to be very, very aware of how they abuse their power, and we did stop it.
[02:38:00.366 --> 02:38:11.512]  That's why InfoWars was shut down, because you talk about abuse of power all the time, you put it to test, and people don't like to be questioned when their power is being questioned or undermined.
[02:38:13.996 --> 02:38:15.557]  So, how does humanity win?
[02:38:15.557 --> 02:38:18.918]  I mean, what's the number one thing you'd say, Clyde?
[02:38:18.918 --> 02:38:28.102]  Now, this is going to sound cliche, but love, tolerance, understanding, realizing we're all human beings, realizing that we all bleed red and we all smell the same in the bathroom every day.
[02:38:28.102 --> 02:38:34.805]  We need to remember that, you know, being human beings, we're also fragile and we're not as tough as we think we are.
[02:38:34.805 --> 02:38:40.187]  And the only way we can be tough is to think, learn, use critical thinking, throw away our confirmation biases and
[02:38:43.114 --> 02:38:43.855]  I think so.
[02:39:04.455 --> 02:39:07.176]  They're getting clean water, and they're out of pain.
[02:39:07.176 --> 02:39:10.396]  Those are the three things that governments have failed to do for the people.
[02:39:10.396 --> 02:39:17.778]  If we can bring forward great food, nutritious food, clean water, and keeping people out of pain, we will have a successful world.
[02:39:17.778 --> 02:39:25.880]  So we need to do that for everyone, and we need to take that into our own hands and make that happen.
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:27.540]  Clyde, I want to go to some phone calls now.
[02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:32.622]  Here in this segment, and maybe a little bit the next hour, I gotta go, but you're on tonight, 10 o'clock.
[02:39:32.622 --> 02:39:34.483]  Is it 400, 500, how many stations are you on?
[02:39:34.483 --> 02:39:34.623]  Well, 300.
[02:39:34.623 --> 02:39:35.504]  So yeah, 300 stations.
[02:39:35.504 --> 02:39:44.048]  So things have gone up and down, but I know you're on a whole bunch of stations, so congratulations on that.
[02:39:44.048 --> 02:39:44.909]  Thanks.
[02:39:44.909 --> 02:39:51.292]  We're gonna go to phone calls now, this segment, the next, do one more little segment with Clyde, hold him over a little bit, because I got him on late.
[02:39:51.292 --> 02:39:54.674]  We got Tom in London, we got Bill in Wisconsin, we got Jeremy in California.
[02:39:56.148 --> 02:39:58.990]  We've got Stefan in Pennsylvania.
[02:39:58.990 --> 02:40:02.992]  We've got Jim in Georgia.
[02:40:02.992 --> 02:40:05.414]  Let's go to Mike in New York first.
[02:40:05.414 --> 02:40:05.954]  You're on the air.
[02:40:05.954 --> 02:40:07.955]  Go ahead.
[02:40:07.955 --> 02:40:08.476]  Awesome, guys.
[02:40:08.476 --> 02:40:09.876]  What an honor to speak to you both.
[02:40:09.876 --> 02:40:11.077]  I love both you guys.
[02:40:11.077 --> 02:40:13.258]  Clyde, your show is amazing.
[02:40:13.258 --> 02:40:16.220]  I'm going to get to the point.
[02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:19.322]  Today you mentioned about MS-13 in America.
[02:40:19.322 --> 02:40:22.404]  You guys are both missing the big point.
[02:40:22.404 --> 02:40:22.844]  MS-13's biggest ally
[02:40:25.317 --> 02:40:27.679]  In Mexico is the Los Zetas.
[02:40:27.679 --> 02:40:33.845]  We trained the Los Zetas in North Carolina under Bill Clinton in Fort Bragg, North Carolina in the 90s.
[02:40:33.845 --> 02:40:35.106]  We've been arming them.
[02:40:35.106 --> 02:40:39.130]  We've been funding them fast and furious.
[02:40:39.130 --> 02:40:47.958]  And the whole, when El Chapo Guzman got captured, it was a whole plot to kind of ignite a big war in Mexico.
[02:40:47.958 --> 02:40:49.459]  And now they're coming across the border.
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:51.341]  They're coming in droves.
[02:40:51.341 --> 02:40:52.062]  They're cannibals.
[02:40:52.062 --> 02:40:52.882]  You can look it up.
[02:40:52.882 --> 02:40:54.504]  They put people into mollies and eat them.
[02:40:54.504 --> 02:40:56.386]  I know it sounds crazy.
[02:40:56.386 --> 02:40:58.507]  No, it's not crazy.
[02:40:58.507 --> 02:40:59.168]  Not crazy.
[02:40:59.168 --> 02:41:03.972]  Did you know that MS-13, the majority of MS-13 are Satan worshippers?
[02:41:03.972 --> 02:41:06.194]  They're also worshippers of Santa Muerte.
[02:41:06.194 --> 02:41:07.055]  So yes, they are.
[02:41:07.055 --> 02:41:07.816]  Let me throw this in.
[02:41:07.816 --> 02:41:13.641]  When I said earlier that the Democrats are using MS-13 as their hit army, it's been confirmed all over the country.
[02:41:13.641 --> 02:41:14.662]  I read newspapers all day.
[02:41:15.362 --> 02:41:22.877]  MS-13 gets caught with Democrats smuggling people, running drugs, and when they get caught, the gang kills the young teenagers that are doing the hits.
[02:41:22.877 --> 02:41:26.123]  So the Democrats are using it as their plausible deniability hit army.
[02:41:27.364 --> 02:41:29.044]  And Muslim Brotherhood and Hezbollah.
[02:41:29.044 --> 02:41:31.425]  This is high level, but it's also in the news.
[02:41:31.425 --> 02:41:37.386]  Like we reported on the Hezbollah Stay Behind Networks here six months before anybody else did, which is one thing that pissed the establishment off.
[02:41:37.386 --> 02:41:38.987]  I just do my research.
[02:41:38.987 --> 02:41:40.867]  And so, exactly.
[02:41:40.867 --> 02:41:46.428]  Clyde, again, they do satanic rituals for the power of the children they kill.
[02:41:46.428 --> 02:41:47.889]  This is who the Democrats are.
[02:41:47.889 --> 02:41:49.509]  It's all voodoo crap.
[02:41:50.049 --> 02:41:51.730]  They eat human flesh, Alex.
[02:41:51.730 --> 02:41:54.251]  They've been known to eat human flesh ritualistically.
[02:41:54.251 --> 02:41:56.472]  They've been known to eat human hearts as well.
[02:41:56.472 --> 02:41:58.253]  It's a sick and terrifying thing.
[02:41:58.253 --> 02:42:00.374]  Just like ISIS.
[02:42:00.374 --> 02:42:01.335]  Yes, just like ISIS.
[02:42:01.335 --> 02:42:03.276]  They're devil worshippers!
[02:42:03.276 --> 02:42:05.037]  No, caller, you're right.
[02:42:05.037 --> 02:42:06.297]  We do know.
[02:42:06.297 --> 02:42:11.220]  And we do know that they're working with the very cartel that the leftist CIA put in charge.
[02:42:11.220 --> 02:42:12.741]  Believe me, that's what I'm saying.
[02:42:12.741 --> 02:42:14.522]  Obama has a stay-behind network of CIA.
[02:42:15.779 --> 02:42:20.224]  They're using the different Mexican cartels and MS-13 in Hezbollah as their army.
[02:42:20.224 --> 02:42:21.445]  That's why I warned people.
[02:42:21.445 --> 02:42:23.127]  I didn't just say that.
[02:42:23.127 --> 02:42:25.490]  If you notice, I don't just say stuff for effect.
[02:42:25.490 --> 02:42:28.753]  They've got the hit teams ready with 32 days out.
[02:42:28.753 --> 02:42:29.754]  So God bless you, Mike.
[02:42:29.754 --> 02:42:31.156]  I'm glad you're informed.
[02:42:31.156 --> 02:42:32.277]  Sounds like Mike was part of the military.
[02:42:33.518 --> 02:42:36.259]  The military is knocking them down like bowling pins right now.
[02:42:36.259 --> 02:42:40.281]  Trump's been taking them out for 20 months, and they are pissed.
[02:42:40.281 --> 02:42:45.203]  There's not many of them left, but they've got the teams ready, and they're targeting members of Congress and the Supreme Court.
[02:42:45.203 --> 02:42:45.964]  Get ready.
[02:42:45.964 --> 02:42:49.025]  We'll be back with more calls with Clyde Lewis from Ground Zero.
[02:42:55.527 --> 02:43:03.912]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.912 --> 02:43:05.373]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.373 --> 02:43:10.076]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:10.076 --> 02:43:15.099]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.319 --> 02:43:35.465]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.965 --> 02:43:39.970]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:43:39.970 --> 02:43:43.633]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:43:43.633 --> 02:43:48.639]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:43:48.639 --> 02:43:51.382]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:43:51.382 --> 02:43:54.225]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:55.492 --> 02:43:59.435]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.435 --> 02:44:02.618]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:02.618 --> 02:44:09.003]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:09.003 --> 02:44:11.766]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:12.506 --> 02:44:16.329]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.329 --> 02:44:22.795]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.795 --> 02:44:27.759]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.519 --> 02:44:32.441]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.441 --> 02:44:39.644]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.644 --> 02:44:44.786]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.786 --> 02:44:50.548]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.548 --> 02:44:54.510]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.540 --> 02:44:56.560]  X2.
[02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:29.562]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[02:45:29.562 --> 02:45:30.722]  Ordered it six months ago.
[02:45:30.722 --> 02:45:32.283]  So I get the price down.
[02:45:32.283 --> 02:45:34.024]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:45:34.024 --> 02:45:35.265]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:45:35.265 --> 02:45:37.226]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[02:45:37.226 --> 02:45:39.607]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[02:45:39.607 --> 02:45:40.947]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[02:45:40.947 --> 02:45:43.429]  I'm sure it's viable shield X2.
[02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:44.909]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[02:45:44.909 --> 02:45:46.870]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:49.592]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarshore.com.
[02:45:49.592 --> 02:45:51.433]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[02:45:51.433 --> 02:45:52.873]  I suggest you stock up on it.

[02:46:53.048 --> 02:46:54.769]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:26.966 --> 02:47:33.111]  We got a load of phone lines, and Joel Gilbert's coming up, and I may be able to twist Clyde Lewis's arm for every 10 minutes the next hour and take more of these.
[02:47:33.111 --> 02:47:33.671]  We're gonna go to him.
[02:47:33.671 --> 02:47:35.913]  And the crew's like, hey, plug, plug.
[02:47:35.913 --> 02:47:37.614]  Other talk shows plug every 30 minutes.
[02:47:37.614 --> 02:47:38.615]  You never plug.
[02:47:38.615 --> 02:47:39.736]  You say we need money, plug.
[02:47:40.552 --> 02:47:41.693]  Hey, I got great products.
[02:47:41.693 --> 02:47:43.315]  Just like our information is cutting edge.

[02:47:51.763 --> 02:47:54.425]  So we're ending a bunch of specials right now.
[02:47:54.425 --> 02:47:57.208]  Brain Force Plus, the great nootrobic, 40% off.

[02:48:03.714 --> 02:48:04.275]  Amazing.
[02:48:04.275 --> 02:48:05.036]  It's our newest product.
[02:48:06.331 --> 02:48:08.392]  As I do a lot of times with the product I'm excited about.
[02:48:08.392 --> 02:48:09.092]  No reviews yet.
[02:48:09.092 --> 02:48:11.874]  See it just came out yesterday or two days ago.
[02:48:11.874 --> 02:48:13.855]  50% off out of the gates.

[02:48:15.676 --> 02:48:17.136]  So thank you all for the support.
[02:48:17.136 --> 02:48:22.599]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:48:22.599 --> 02:48:26.561]  And we're ending the specials, not on Happies, it'll go for another week.
[02:48:26.561 --> 02:48:30.183]  We're ending the specials this weekend, got some big specials next week, but on BrainForce,
[02:48:31.658 --> 02:48:34.460]  And on Secret 12, some of our best sellers, this is it.
[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:37.002]  Because I've been so busy, I haven't gone for the new specials.
[02:48:37.002 --> 02:48:38.564]  Right after I get off air today, I'm going to do it.
[02:48:38.564 --> 02:48:39.945]  Just like X2 took me a week to get rid of.
[02:48:41.351 --> 02:48:42.651]  On sale?
[02:48:42.651 --> 02:48:43.412]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[02:48:43.412 --> 02:48:44.172]  Don't do the same thing.
[02:48:44.172 --> 02:48:46.152]  Last day, last day, oh, last day, last day.
[02:48:46.152 --> 02:48:47.333]  Because I'm just so busy.
[02:48:47.333 --> 02:48:56.035]  But without you buying the books, the videos, the t-shirts, without you signing up for auto-ship, additional 10% off, free orders of $50 a morning, you get free shipping.
[02:48:56.035 --> 02:48:58.056]  That's how we fund our operation.
[02:48:58.056 --> 02:48:59.236]  So, again, very, very exciting.
[02:48:59.236 --> 02:49:01.857]  I want to go back to calls with Clyde Lewis here, who's on fire today.
[02:49:02.917 --> 02:49:06.518]  Let's talk to Pastor Sam in Oklahoma.
[02:49:06.518 --> 02:49:10.359]  I want to talk about Kavanaugh, Trojan Horse, The Good Shepherd, and Devil Worship.
[02:49:10.359 --> 02:49:13.820]  You're on the air with the Ground Zero host, Clyde Lewis.
[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:16.281]  Clyde Lewis, I love the title of your book.
[02:49:16.281 --> 02:49:18.141]  I'm going to have to look at that.
[02:49:18.141 --> 02:49:24.023]  I myself am an unabashed and admitted anti-transubstantiationalist.
[02:49:24.023 --> 02:49:31.245]  It's probably the only point upon which Alex and I disagree, and I'm glad he's open to a little lively debate on that from time to time.
[02:49:33.310 --> 02:49:42.832]  I do believe that Kavanaugh is a Trojan horse, because he's a transubstantiationalist, because he came out of a university.
[02:49:42.832 --> 02:49:46.413]  I'm not as sophisticated as you, and I mean that.
[02:49:46.413 --> 02:49:50.854]  Define your definition of a trans... whatever.
[02:49:50.854 --> 02:49:53.074]  A transubstantiationalist.
[02:49:53.074 --> 02:49:55.315]  You know, this is the Catholic right.
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:02.082]  And it's really easy to just point the finger across the aisle, but the problem is that Catholic... But there's this thing online that I'm Catholic.
[02:50:02.082 --> 02:50:05.163]  I don't think it's Catholics, but sir, I'm not Catholic.
[02:50:05.163 --> 02:50:11.085]  I know you're not Catholic, but... But how can I be something if I don't even know what the name is?
[02:50:11.085 --> 02:50:20.548]  I mean, I'm learning about it now, but just... Everybody's a little bit Catholic, and this is the abominable right of the Catholic Communion, where the cookie is blessed
[02:50:21.041 --> 02:50:27.644]  The priest commands Jesus to come down out of heaven and inhabit that host or that cookie, that death.
[02:50:27.644 --> 02:50:31.746]  Oh, you're talking about it becoming the real body and the blood and the flesh.
[02:50:31.746 --> 02:50:32.606]  Okay, I know about that.
[02:50:32.606 --> 02:50:34.127]  In fact, I remember now.
[02:50:34.127 --> 02:50:36.708]  Let's get Clyde Lewis' take on this because we're getting it.
[02:50:38.008 --> 02:50:43.273]  The whole reason why I called my book Transhuman Substantiation is the sacrament of transhumanism.
[02:50:43.273 --> 02:50:52.041]  It's the idea of taking that wafer, or taking that leap into getting the chip, or taking that leap into becoming more of a machine.
[02:50:52.041 --> 02:50:52.662]  Oh, I get it!
[02:50:52.662 --> 02:50:53.623]  Oh, that's really smart!
[02:50:53.623 --> 02:51:03.472]  You jump into the machine, you upload your consciousness, you're really dying, but just like the wafer or whatever, in a twisted way, you believe you're becoming this new creature when you're really dying.
[02:51:04.119 --> 02:51:16.126]  Like, I mean, when you eat the wafer, you drink the wine, you're becoming, uh, according to, uh, you know, Catholicism, it's, you're drinking the blood of, uh, the blood and eating the body of Christ, and it turns into, literally, the body and blood of Christ.
[02:51:16.126 --> 02:51:19.248]  If you take the... But Christ really said, just do this to remember me.
[02:51:19.248 --> 02:51:20.229]  He wasn't saying it's literal.
[02:51:21.004 --> 02:51:25.267]  Well, I mean, that's what Catholics talk about, is the literal transubstantiation.
[02:51:25.267 --> 02:51:38.257]  But just the idea of the transubstantiation of accepting, let's just say, a cookie, okay, on a computer, what you're doing is you're actually, I mean, every little bit moves you closer to becoming a transhumanist.
[02:51:38.257 --> 02:51:41.540]  Closer to becoming more... They're all being walked into being cyborgs.
[02:51:42.321 --> 02:51:42.821]  Pretty much.
[02:51:42.821 --> 02:51:47.623]  I mean, you know, that's what Elon Musk said when he was smoking that blunt on Joe Rogan.
[02:51:47.623 --> 02:51:51.884]  He said, every day, you know, we find ourselves becoming more like the Borg.
[02:51:51.884 --> 02:51:53.265]  And it's exactly what we are.
[02:51:53.265 --> 02:51:54.725]  We're becoming more like the Borg.
[02:51:54.725 --> 02:51:56.306]  We're losing our humanity.
[02:51:56.306 --> 02:51:58.106]  We're rejecting Jesus Christ.
[02:51:58.106 --> 02:51:59.147]  We're rejecting God.
[02:51:59.687 --> 02:52:02.988]  And we want to be more like machines, and we treat people like machines.
[02:52:02.988 --> 02:52:09.169]  This is obviously seen as the social cohesion falls apart with things like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
[02:52:09.169 --> 02:52:10.750]  You know, we can't express ourselves.
[02:52:10.750 --> 02:52:12.190]  Clearly, it's taking us over.
[02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:13.651]  Great points, Pastor Sam.
[02:52:13.651 --> 02:52:15.191]  Appreciate that call.
[02:52:15.191 --> 02:52:17.612]  Let's talk to Stefan.
[02:52:17.612 --> 02:52:18.732]  You're on the air from Pennsylvania.
[02:52:18.732 --> 02:52:20.712]  Welcome.
[02:52:20.712 --> 02:52:21.192]  Hi, Clyde.
[02:52:21.192 --> 02:52:21.713]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:21.713 --> 02:52:22.493]  How are you guys doing today?
[02:52:22.493 --> 02:52:23.173]  I'm doing alright, brother.
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:25.521]  Oh, that's good.
[02:52:25.521 --> 02:52:41.512]  So, I heard you guys talking about the cult and AI, and I just wanted to kind of tie in the 5G element to that, because I think that extra-dimensional kind of shadow... Oh yeah, beyond the smart dust, it's just 5G blasting and you can't escape it.
[02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:59.021]  Right, because for some reason these types of species, they cluster around ionization and the way that we are operating right now in our world, we use explosive radiating technology which ionizes the entire atmosphere and ions positively charge the unraveled DNA.
[02:52:59.835 --> 02:53:08.204]  So what I think they're trying to do with the 5G, they're trying to suppress the human residence, which is the natural residence that our DNA uses to kind of send messages.
[02:53:08.204 --> 02:53:13.710]  Well, we're literally building giant DNA cutting human killing machines.
[02:53:13.710 --> 02:53:17.033]  And to cut us off from our ancestral spirit and to cut us away from God.
[02:53:17.033 --> 02:53:19.296]  And we're building the weapon system to kill ourselves.
[02:53:20.345 --> 02:53:21.286]  Exactly.
[02:53:21.286 --> 02:53:24.389]  Yeah, the 5G system, I mean the FCC is requiring it.
[02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:31.918]  They're pushing communities to say you have 60 to 90 days to give us your decision on whether or not we want to put antennas every five feet in your community.
[02:53:31.918 --> 02:53:37.744]  We're going to give you 60 to 90 days to decide whether or not you want CCTV cameras everywhere.
[02:53:38.504 --> 02:53:46.448]  You know, they were saying in order for this whole system to work, they have to install 1 trillion sensors around the world by 2020.
[02:53:46.448 --> 02:53:48.609]  How are they going to do that?
[02:53:48.609 --> 02:53:49.230]  Nanotech.
[02:53:49.230 --> 02:53:50.851]  They're going to be able to drop it everywhere.
[02:53:50.851 --> 02:53:54.192]  And this is clearly a warfare takeover.
[02:53:54.192 --> 02:54:01.836]  Yeah, well, it's basically, as the caller says, to cloud our thinking and to cloud our connection.
[02:54:01.836 --> 02:54:04.798]  Which they admit, clouds your thinking, breaks your DNA.
[02:54:04.798 --> 02:54:05.458]  Exactly.
[02:54:05.458 --> 02:54:06.839]  And then you look at
[02:54:09.374 --> 02:54:17.222]  Ford, Dr. Ford, she's an expert in microwave radiation to implant false memories.
[02:54:17.222 --> 02:54:21.347]  Yeah, and you know, her background is she has a family, you know, in the CIA.
[02:54:21.347 --> 02:54:22.648]  But who can make that up?
[02:54:22.648 --> 02:54:27.033]  That she works at Stanford in erasing memories and false memories.
[02:54:27.033 --> 02:54:27.814]  I mean, what?
[02:54:29.654 --> 02:54:31.295]  It's quite coincidental, is it not?
[02:54:31.295 --> 02:54:33.217]  That's what I was talking about.
[02:54:33.217 --> 02:54:35.118]  Meaningful coincidences and synchronicities.
[02:54:35.118 --> 02:54:42.184]  I mean, you get that sinking feeling, you know, that something feels like déjà vu, or it feels like, why does this not surprise me?
[02:54:42.184 --> 02:54:45.087]  It's because it's just the way government operates.
[02:54:45.087 --> 02:54:48.289]  And you can see the cold overtones, the dark archetypes.
[02:54:48.289 --> 02:54:49.811]  I mean, Carl Jung explained this.
[02:54:50.672 --> 02:54:57.799]  With his Jungian philosophies about how humans tick and their unconscious mind in dream time, how everything seems to be conjured.
[02:54:57.799 --> 02:55:00.662]  And then these unconscious people, they end up taking over.
[02:55:00.662 --> 02:55:01.322]  God Almighty.
[02:55:01.322 --> 02:55:03.324]  Great job, Stefan.
[02:55:03.324 --> 02:55:04.445]  Great points.
[02:55:04.445 --> 02:55:05.707]  Let's go to Tom in London.
[02:55:05.707 --> 02:55:07.048]  Tom, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:55:07.048 --> 02:55:07.508]  Go ahead.
[02:55:07.508 --> 02:55:10.011]  Got a prediction about Kavanaugh.
[02:55:10.011 --> 02:55:12.093]  Hi Alex and hi Clyde.
[02:55:12.093 --> 02:55:13.895]  I'm calling you from the capital
[02:55:14.717 --> 02:55:19.299]  Of surveillance and CCTV and 5G test areas.
[02:55:19.299 --> 02:55:21.980]  You're calling us from airstrip one!
[02:55:21.980 --> 02:55:25.181]  That's right, exactly.
[02:55:25.181 --> 02:55:35.245]  I usually point out my correct predictions I've made in the past, but I mean a year ago I predicted that Trump would be gone by last week and he's still there.
[02:55:35.245 --> 02:55:38.486]  I remember you called, you failed again.
[02:55:39.366 --> 02:55:40.847]  No, I failed once.
[02:55:40.847 --> 02:55:44.349]  I think that they put back the time.
[02:55:44.349 --> 02:55:46.010]  I think a lot of things came out.
[02:55:46.010 --> 02:55:51.814]  I think they were planning to get rid of him over the summer, before September.
[02:55:51.814 --> 02:55:58.158]  Well, give us your Kavanaugh prediction, because I remember when you called, you had a few predictions came true, you had some that came not true.
[02:55:58.158 --> 02:56:05.022]  Well, the Kavanaugh one is, I'm not 100% sure if he'll actually be voted on.
[02:56:05.022 --> 02:56:08.344]  It depends who is the best strategist.
[02:56:08.993 --> 02:56:14.736]  Because Kavanaugh on the court will vastly benefit Democrats, electorally.
[02:56:14.736 --> 02:56:16.476]  I mean, people are saying the opposite.
[02:56:16.476 --> 02:56:19.038]  People are saying that it's going to energize Republicans.
[02:56:19.038 --> 02:56:21.519]  But I think the opposite is true.
[02:56:21.519 --> 02:56:29.322]  And I actually think that the Democrats have it in their hand, and they're going to play their haunted mansion card.
[02:56:29.322 --> 02:56:35.265]  And mansion... Whatever mansion does is what happens.
[02:56:38.074 --> 02:56:47.886]  And I think that the Machiavellian conversations going on behind the scenes are to do with making sure that Kavanaugh is put on the court.
[02:56:49.333 --> 02:56:53.238]  Uh, and that's a part of an establishment plan to discredit the institution.
[02:56:53.238 --> 02:56:57.182]  So they wanted to put Trump in and then... Well, I'm pretty sure Kavanaugh gets in.
[02:56:57.182 --> 02:57:01.567]  Let me tell you, the Democrats' power-grabbing, that's just raw idiocy.
[02:57:01.567 --> 02:57:05.691]  So I don't think there's a larger sophisticated, there's a larger sophisticated global plan for the technocracy.
[02:57:05.691 --> 02:57:09.135]  But the inner-fightings of the low-level minions, I don't think are that sophisticated.
[02:57:09.135 --> 02:57:10.296]  Let me get Clyde Lewis' tag.
[02:57:10.296 --> 02:57:10.816]  Thanks, Tom.
[02:57:10.816 --> 02:57:11.037]  Clyde?
[02:57:12.168 --> 02:57:18.472]  Well, I mean, you're seeing, I mean, I can see where he's coming from with his idea of the predictions.
[02:57:18.472 --> 02:57:19.893]  We're looking at pressure.
[02:57:19.893 --> 02:57:21.654]  And, of course, he's under a lot of pressure.
[02:57:21.654 --> 02:57:30.079]  If he, and when he gets, you know, put into the position, there'll be a lot of pressure on him for the rest of his career.
[02:57:30.079 --> 02:57:38.625]  And, of course, when you're under that kind of pressure, you make decisions that aren't necessarily wise, or you make decisions based on, you see what happened with Flake.
[02:57:39.226 --> 02:57:40.729]  Uh, you know, Clayton was about to make his move.
[02:57:40.729 --> 02:57:41.070]  Yeah, come back.
[02:57:41.070 --> 02:57:43.695]  Do a little more with us ahead of the next... We'll take a few more calls with Clyde Lewis.
[02:57:45.319 --> 02:57:55.908]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:57:55.908 --> 02:57:57.969]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:57:57.969 --> 02:58:00.832]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:58:00.832 --> 02:58:02.333]  It's made in the USA.
[02:58:02.333 --> 02:58:09.158]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:58:09.158 --> 02:58:10.379]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:20.925]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:58:20.925 --> 02:58:37.733]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:58:37.733 --> 02:58:40.895]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:58:41.055 --> 02:58:46.438]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:58:46.438 --> 02:58:48.800]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:55.383]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[02:58:55.383 --> 02:58:59.366]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[02:59:12.855 --> 02:59:20.020]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA.
[02:59:20.980 --> 02:59:24.843]  Which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.

[02:59:49.342 --> 02:59:57.684]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:57.684 --> 03:00:06.627]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.192 --> 03:00:27.934]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:27.934 --> 03:00:28.634]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.634 --> 03:00:30.556]  Clyde Lewis rides a shotgun with us.
[03:00:30.556 --> 03:00:31.857]  We really appreciate him being on with us.
[03:00:31.857 --> 03:00:33.098]  We're taking your phone calls.
[03:00:33.098 --> 03:00:35.580]  This segment, the next, and then the 15 after.
[03:00:35.580 --> 03:00:36.201]  In comes...
[03:00:37.785 --> 03:00:44.924]  The great patriot and a great researcher who will be getting into so many subjects here today, Joel Gilbert.
[03:00:47.063 --> 03:00:51.465]  There's no doubt we're being manipulated, and they don't want us to become conscious of that.
[03:00:51.465 --> 03:00:54.787]  That's what we're talking about here today.
[03:00:54.787 --> 03:00:59.710]  Clyde, you got caught off by the break, but you've heard the caller predicting all this about Kavanaugh.
[03:00:59.710 --> 03:01:05.093]  I've noticed there's sophisticated master plans on top, and Trump definitely is disrupting that.
[03:01:05.093 --> 03:01:06.813]  Doesn't mean he's perfect, but he's trying to disrupt that.
[03:01:06.813 --> 03:01:08.454]  Disagree, if you want.
[03:01:08.454 --> 03:01:15.238]  But the idea that Kavanaugh knows he's part of a scam and all this, I don't think that's what's going on here.
[03:01:16.311 --> 03:01:20.252]  Well, most of the time I get the feeling that Trump is an accidental tourist.
[03:01:20.252 --> 03:01:21.953]  He has the attitude of an accidental tourist.
[03:01:21.953 --> 03:01:34.356]  He's there, he's president, he does a lot of great work in the background, people criticize him and kick him around, and sometimes he just accidentally does something where everyone's going, wow, that's a move we never thought would happen from President Trump.
[03:01:34.997 --> 03:01:36.298]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[03:01:50.739 --> 03:02:00.745]  Uh, this took a lot of blood, sweat and tears to get him in the position he's in right now, regardless of how you feel about whether or not he is guilty or not guilty or that he did what he did or what have you.
[03:02:00.745 --> 03:02:07.009]  The thing to realize is that once he's there, once he's put in the position, he will always have to be looking over his shoulder.
[03:02:07.009 --> 03:02:13.372]  He will always be the man that you will always suspect may have been or may have been that guy.
[03:02:13.372 --> 03:02:14.613]  And I think that puts a lot of pressure
[03:02:14.633 --> 03:02:24.140]  Pressure on him to sometimes, I think, knuckle under to some of the desires of the left.
[03:02:24.140 --> 03:02:36.230]  And this is something that may create that Trojan horse effect where we're getting the guy we think we're getting, but he'll have to make some compromises in order to keep the peace.
[03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:40.733]  I mean, I dread the confirmation on Saturday.
[03:02:40.733 --> 03:02:41.153]  I dread it.
[03:02:42.194 --> 03:02:46.981]  Uh, it just goes along with what I've been saying towards this final blow event or whatever it may be.
[03:02:46.981 --> 03:02:55.572]  I mean, I said that, uh, I should have said and specified, but I didn't because I thought that, you know, a full-on biological attack would be what we'd see.
[03:02:55.572 --> 03:02:57.575]  We only got part of that with the ricin attack.
[03:02:57.575 --> 03:02:59.658]  It was only a, it was a biological attack.
[03:03:00.018 --> 03:03:00.238]  We're good.
[03:03:15.074 --> 03:03:28.302]  Or, in order to support the vote in Dalles, Oregon, the people who are part of the Rosh Hashanah cult actually poisoned, or Salmonella poisoned people in one of the worst biological attacks on the United States.
[03:03:28.302 --> 03:03:30.043]  They were trying to change the vote.
[03:03:30.043 --> 03:03:38.048]  And I worry that this type of attack, a biological attack, would be done to change either the votes in November,
[03:03:38.948 --> 03:03:41.009]  Which would be a way to do this.
[03:03:41.009 --> 03:03:47.070]  Or I never thought it would be used to actually try and thwart the decision of Kavanaugh.
[03:03:47.070 --> 03:03:49.091]  So this may be a trial run.
[03:03:49.091 --> 03:03:56.913]  This may be a trial run to an even bigger one where they want to use a biological weapon or some sort of biological attack to thwart the vote in November.
[03:03:56.913 --> 03:03:58.634]  And this would be something that would be even worse.
[03:03:58.634 --> 03:03:59.814]  Well that was my next question.
[03:03:59.814 --> 03:04:02.355]  We'll take a few calls and let you get out of here because you've got your own show tonight.
[03:04:03.351 --> 03:04:07.512]  Clearly Soros, the Democrats, the Globos are saying we're in an emergency.
[03:04:07.512 --> 03:04:08.773]  We're going to attack everybody.
[03:04:08.773 --> 03:04:10.133]  The death threats are off the chart.
[03:04:10.133 --> 03:04:12.194]  Hundreds and hundreds of arrests yesterday and today.
[03:04:12.194 --> 03:04:13.674]  They're saying civil emergency.
[03:04:13.674 --> 03:04:15.015]  We're not going to back down.
[03:04:15.015 --> 03:04:16.855]  They are ramped up to crazy towns.
[03:04:16.855 --> 03:04:18.376]  When we come back, just briefly, because I want to go to calls.
[03:04:19.187 --> 03:04:37.368]  What, because you did predict this Ryerson attack, what do you think the deep state, the corrupt elements of it, what are their, because somebody had nuclear submarines in the deep state, or somebody at NORADS in deep state, but that doesn't mean they're the deep state operatives or the shadow government, what is the shadow government, the corrupt shadow government, what are they going to pull next?
[03:04:37.928 --> 03:04:38.488]  Clyde Lewis.
[03:04:38.488 --> 03:04:43.431]  Then we've got, obviously, another guest host coming up who's got a lot loaded up.
[03:04:43.431 --> 03:04:44.331]  Joel Gilbert.
[03:04:44.331 --> 03:04:45.352]  Infowars.com.
[03:04:45.352 --> 03:04:46.252]  Newswars.com.
[03:04:46.252 --> 03:04:50.214]  I cannot stress to you, the entire Gloveless program must have shut down Infowars.
[03:04:50.214 --> 03:04:51.295]  Why is that?
[03:04:51.295 --> 03:04:53.056]  I'm not quite sure, but just spread the links.
[03:04:54.497 --> 03:04:56.818]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[03:04:56.818 --> 03:05:02.601]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.
[03:05:02.601 --> 03:05:11.025]  Combine FloraLife Everyday Maintenance and Carnivore to help you fuel your gut and body and take advantage of the powerful nutrients you receive.

[03:06:05.390 --> 03:06:09.432]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:09.432 --> 03:06:10.833]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.833 --> 03:06:16.776]  Well, we have a lot of guests on, and a lot of them are amazing, but let me tell you, Clyde Lewis is impressive.
[03:06:18.167 --> 03:06:29.775]  And I'll be honest, I've listened to his show probably a hundred times, but these days with four children and the rest of it by like 10 at night, I tune in sometimes when I'm not driving around, but I should really listen to his podcast or subscribe to it because he does a great job.
[03:06:29.775 --> 03:06:35.279]  Just like InfoWars does a pretty damn good job, so without you word-of-mouth spreading us, we're gonna get shut down.
[03:06:35.279 --> 03:06:36.620]  They bet that's gonna happen.
[03:06:36.620 --> 03:06:37.181]  We'll see, but...
[03:06:37.981 --> 03:06:39.623]  Your points are really on target.
[03:06:39.623 --> 03:06:43.969]  We'll take a few calls before you leave us here at this segment, but let me ask this question.
[03:06:43.969 --> 03:06:46.772]  You predicted the Ryerson attack and a lot more.
[03:06:46.772 --> 03:06:53.241]  What do you think the corrupt elements of the shadow government of the deep state, in your crystal ball, what's up their sleeve studying history?
[03:06:54.738 --> 03:06:55.219]  We're good to go.
[03:07:10.840 --> 03:07:13.861]  Or, of course, Iran is always there in the background as something to consider.
[03:07:13.861 --> 03:07:17.622]  Maybe even some very shaky ground with North Korea.
[03:07:17.622 --> 03:07:21.903]  I would say, though, that North Korea and Iran are probably the least of my worries.
[03:07:21.903 --> 03:07:33.406]  I think the relationship we have with Russia is still going to be in the crosshairs of the liberal globalist elite trying to vilify any relationship we may have with Russia, while China is still lurking in the background.
[03:07:33.826 --> 03:07:34.426]  We're good to go.
[03:07:50.473 --> 03:07:53.196]  Donald Trump through the war footing ringer.
[03:07:53.196 --> 03:07:55.558]  They need to see how he will... Exactly!
[03:07:55.558 --> 03:07:56.919]  We'll go back to you in a moment.
[03:07:56.919 --> 03:07:57.619]  We'll go back to you in a moment.
[03:07:57.619 --> 03:07:59.501]  That's the critically key there.
[03:07:59.501 --> 03:08:00.562]  It is, literally, historically.
[03:08:00.562 --> 03:08:02.003]  They always do these same patterns.
[03:08:02.003 --> 03:08:07.468]  Here is one of the senators, one of the deciding votes right now, saying how she's going to vote.
[03:08:07.468 --> 03:08:07.828]  Here it is.
[03:08:07.828 --> 03:08:09.430]  Susan Collins.
[03:08:09.430 --> 03:08:12.672]  ...of a justice to the United States Supreme Court.
[03:08:13.813 --> 03:08:25.810]  I have begun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of the occasion.
[03:08:27.049 --> 03:08:49.107]  But today, we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional, it looks more like a caricature of a gutter-level political campaign than a solemn occasion.
[03:08:49.107 --> 03:08:53.250]  The president nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July 9th.
[03:08:54.935 --> 03:09:12.601]  Within moments of that announcement, special interest groups raced to be the first to oppose him, including one organization that didn't even bother to fill in the judge's name on its pre-written press release.
[03:09:12.601 --> 03:09:13.641]  Yeah, they just put four names.
[03:09:13.641 --> 03:09:15.042]  They simply wrote,
[03:09:16.676 --> 03:09:25.683]  That they opposed Donald Trump's nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States.
[03:09:25.683 --> 03:09:27.765]  Guys, when she endorses Kavanaugh, let me know and fete it up.
[03:09:27.765 --> 03:09:29.006]  We don't need to hear any more of this.
[03:09:29.006 --> 03:09:30.768]  We can see where she's going.
[03:09:30.768 --> 03:09:32.329]  Clyde, don't you agree she's about to endorse Kavanaugh?
[03:09:33.132 --> 03:09:36.176]  Of course, I think Kavanaugh will be confirmed.
[03:09:36.176 --> 03:09:38.559]  I think it's a given that he'll be confirmed.
[03:09:38.559 --> 03:09:45.789]  Once again, it was the media that kept us on the edge of the sea, because I think that when you're dealing with the liberal media, they don't want you to give away the entire story yet.
[03:09:45.789 --> 03:09:47.712]  But we were saying like days ago, I had
[03:09:48.252 --> 03:09:52.414]  I had said on my program, I go, they'll come to the decision on Wednesday.
[03:09:52.414 --> 03:09:55.335]  We will have that test going over the phones.
[03:09:55.335 --> 03:10:01.978]  They may have the vote immediately, but then I didn't realize that they would probably do a day to announce it, and then they would do the vote.
[03:10:01.978 --> 03:10:05.740]  I was predicting the vote would be on Friday, but they're moving into Saturday.
[03:10:05.740 --> 03:10:11.022]  So I was off in my day's predictions of what was happening, but yeah.
[03:10:11.022 --> 03:10:14.283]  And I would say that after the confirmation,
[03:10:16.204 --> 03:10:20.105]  I tell my listeners to be prepared for anything, and what I mean by this is... Oh, I agree.
[03:10:20.105 --> 03:10:22.746]  I think the Democrats may go super ape.
[03:10:22.746 --> 03:10:29.408]  Oh yeah, this will go supernova, especially where I live because, you know, I've had to plan my life around riots in downtown.
[03:10:29.408 --> 03:10:32.949]  I've had flashbangs going off near my studios.
[03:10:32.949 --> 03:10:35.090]  It gets really ugly here in Portland.
[03:10:35.825 --> 03:10:41.432]  Yeah, it gets really ugly because we're literally a liberal city.
[03:10:41.432 --> 03:10:45.637]  I call you a classical liberal, I've been listening to you for over a decade.
[03:10:45.637 --> 03:10:48.881]  The new liberals, they're not liberal, they're very fascist.
[03:10:50.165 --> 03:10:53.188]  Well, and that's why I call them neoliberals.
[03:10:53.188 --> 03:10:55.210]  We have neocons and neoliberals.
[03:10:55.210 --> 03:10:58.313]  Neocons are fascists and neoliberals are fascists.
[03:10:58.313 --> 03:11:09.184]  Like you say, being a classic libertarian or someone who's willing to be fiscally conservative and socially liberal has always been what most Americans are.
[03:11:09.184 --> 03:11:14.049]  But it turns out to be liberal, it's a bad thing, and being very extreme on the conservative side is a bad thing.
[03:11:14.369 --> 03:11:18.951]  So keep yourself in the middle or at least somewhere where you have values and morals.
[03:11:18.951 --> 03:11:19.772]  But that's what's scary.
[03:11:19.772 --> 03:11:24.934]  If you really tune into Infowars and hear our guest, we're like Americana, free will, Martin Luther King.
[03:11:24.934 --> 03:11:29.777]  They project that we're this other thing we're not, but on the extreme right and left, those are the crazy people.
[03:11:29.777 --> 03:11:34.099]  And then they're saying I'm an extreme right winger and alt-right when the alt-right hates me.
[03:11:34.838 --> 03:11:37.279]  Well, it's because they don't know how to deal with you unless they label you.
[03:11:37.279 --> 03:11:45.864]  That's the biggest problem I have, is because I've kept myself in a pretty balanced state, and there are plenty of people out there who say, oh, Clyde Lewis is a liberal, or Clyde Lewis is a conservative.
[03:11:45.864 --> 03:11:49.946]  You don't know what I am, and I really don't care about being liberal or conservative.
[03:11:49.946 --> 03:11:53.048]  All I care about is humanity and getting the word out there.
[03:11:53.048 --> 03:11:58.791]  It's called objective journalism, and having objectivity, and having critical analysis of what is going on.
[03:11:59.131 --> 03:12:04.255]  And it may step on toes, and the truth will set you free, but it'll piss you off in the process.
[03:12:04.255 --> 03:12:07.038]  Get with that program and understand that.
[03:12:07.038 --> 03:12:08.179]  People ask me what I am.
[03:12:08.179 --> 03:12:10.381]  I just want progress to be free.
[03:12:10.381 --> 03:12:12.683]  And then I look at the left everywhere trying to shut down free speech.
[03:12:12.683 --> 03:12:15.125]  I was like, if the right wing was doing that, I'd be at war with them.
[03:12:15.125 --> 03:12:17.266]  Let's take a call here with Clyde Lewis.
[03:12:17.266 --> 03:12:19.969]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Toronto, Canada.
[03:12:19.969 --> 03:12:21.190]  George, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:12:23.098 --> 03:12:28.622]  Hi, thank you for the call, and my question is very quick and simple.
[03:12:28.622 --> 03:12:33.265]  I believe what you're talking about, a lot of the things, is the Book of Eve.
[03:12:33.265 --> 03:12:38.508]  It's been mentioned briefly in scriptures in the past, and there's a lot of scriptures in the Bible.
[03:12:38.508 --> 03:12:44.972]  Actually, a lot of scriptures that have been removed from the Bible over time to get to the watered-down version.
[03:12:44.972 --> 03:12:47.494]  Well, that's admitted that half the Bible's been cut out, yeah.
[03:12:48.084 --> 03:12:51.126]  Apocrypha, yes.
[03:12:51.126 --> 03:13:05.473]  Could the Vatican and all these perverse Satanists that we have today that we are constantly battling and doing war against Alex Jones and every other patriot, could they be worshipping out of the Book of Eve?
[03:13:07.874 --> 03:13:10.658]  I wouldn't know that they're worshipping out of any apocrypha.
[03:13:10.658 --> 03:13:14.763]  I know that the Catholic Church does use the Book of Maccabees occasionally.
[03:13:14.763 --> 03:13:25.916]  But the thing is, is that a well-rounded education in all religion would, something I would encourage, rather than saying you know something about the Koran, read something about the Koran.
[03:13:25.916 --> 03:13:27.578]  We need a classical education.
[03:13:27.938 --> 03:13:28.718]  Which they're moving away from.
[03:13:28.718 --> 03:13:30.659]  Yes, have a well-rounded education.
[03:13:30.659 --> 03:13:31.939]  And also with the occult.
[03:13:31.939 --> 03:13:34.740]  I mean, that doesn't mean you have to go and play in the occult.
[03:13:34.740 --> 03:13:40.281]  I was about to say, just because you read some satanic book of child sacrifice doesn't mean you're killing kids.
[03:13:40.281 --> 03:13:45.243]  When I was like 13, I was buying at the mall Mein Kampf because I wanted to know what Hitler wrote.
[03:13:45.243 --> 03:13:46.803]  The woman asked me, are you a Nazi?
[03:13:46.803 --> 03:13:49.864]  And I said, no lady, I'm gonna read what Hitler wrote.
[03:13:49.864 --> 03:13:50.704]  Doesn't mean I like Hitler.
[03:13:51.479 --> 03:13:58.174]  Well, I mean, George Lucas watched Triumph of the Wills to get ideas of how he could depict the Stormtroopers and Darth Vader in Star Wars.
[03:13:58.174 --> 03:13:59.036]  That doesn't make him a Nazi.
[03:14:00.728 --> 03:14:07.350]  Well exactly, but that's like the idea that if I read, like take Louis Farrakhan, I don't know who it is, but I've interviewed him.
[03:14:07.350 --> 03:14:08.970]  People say, why do you endorse Louis Farrakhan?
[03:14:08.970 --> 03:14:09.931]  I don't endorse everything.
[03:14:09.931 --> 03:14:12.551]  The point is I'm interviewing Louis Farrakhan.
[03:14:12.551 --> 03:14:17.573]  The idea that you can't interview me, like I'm so evil, because they don't want you to kill their hearts.
[03:14:17.573 --> 03:14:18.153]  That was the question.
[03:14:18.153 --> 03:14:21.314]  They say, well you want to interview Alex Jones, that's going to put you in a situation.
[03:14:21.314 --> 03:14:22.774]  You support Alex Jones, he's your boy.
[03:14:22.774 --> 03:14:24.435]  I go, Alex Jones is a colleague.
[03:14:25.015 --> 03:14:44.184]  I don't always agree with what he says, but I respect his right to say it, and I respect the fact that he's taken a very small public access television show and turned it into one of the biggest media centers in the world to bring about the speaking against state.
[03:14:44.184 --> 03:14:48.466]  And you cannot deny that, but of course the media wants to attack that.
[03:14:49.126 --> 03:14:59.537]  And it just really irritates me that, you know, the media does some very, very shady things, and no one calls them on it, and they should be called on it all the time, I think.
[03:14:59.537 --> 03:15:01.599]  Clyde, I really appreciate all the time today.
[03:15:01.599 --> 03:15:03.841]  Obviously, you're at GroundZeroMedia.org.
[03:15:03.841 --> 03:15:04.822]  GroundZeroMedia.org.
[03:15:04.822 --> 03:15:06.164]  Thank you so much for having us on.
[03:15:06.164 --> 03:15:10.889]  I look forward to coming back on with you very, very soon, and thank you for a very powerful two-plus hours.
[03:15:11.826 --> 03:15:15.249]  Thank you and remember my book, Transhuman Substantiation, now at Amazon.
[03:15:15.249 --> 03:15:17.891]  Just type in Clyde Lewis, you'll see all the books I'm offering.
[03:15:17.891 --> 03:15:28.301]  I would like to get a lot of people to read the book because it certainly spans three years of how we've ignored how innovations are getting out of hand and we need to have a debate on how we can take care of this.
[03:15:28.681 --> 03:15:29.962]  I can't wait to read it myself.
[03:15:29.962 --> 03:15:30.622]  Thank you, Clyde.
[03:15:30.622 --> 03:15:33.585]  Okay, Joel Gilbert's loaded for bear, and then the war room.
[03:15:33.585 --> 03:15:36.166]  I'll have everything coming up in about 45 minutes.
[03:15:36.166 --> 03:15:37.387]  So much happening.
[03:15:37.387 --> 03:15:38.288]  Sorry to the rest of the callers.
[03:15:38.288 --> 03:15:38.808]  I try my best.
[03:15:38.808 --> 03:15:40.590]  Wendy and Jim and everybody.
[03:15:40.590 --> 03:15:44.512]  When you call back in, just the next few days, say, hey, I didn't get on air.
[03:15:44.512 --> 03:15:45.873]  We'll put you in the front of the line.

[03:17:22.808 --> 03:17:24.048]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:24.048 --> 03:17:27.969]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.969 --> 03:17:29.509]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.509 --> 03:17:32.450]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.450 --> 03:17:38.011]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.011 --> 03:17:39.211]  I can help you, too.

[03:17:54.451 --> 03:17:58.366]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:17:59.696 --> 03:18:08.379]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:18:08.379 --> 03:18:10.360]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:18:10.360 --> 03:18:13.821]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:18:13.821 --> 03:18:16.442]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:18:16.442 --> 03:18:18.723]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:18:18.723 --> 03:18:25.686]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[03:18:26.226 --> 03:18:36.034]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:18:36.034 --> 03:18:37.215]  We'll win.
[03:18:37.215 --> 03:18:40.117]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:18:40.117 --> 03:18:47.263]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:18:47.263 --> 03:18:50.966]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[03:18:50.966 --> 03:18:52.527]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:18:52.527 --> 03:18:53.207]  We need your support.
[03:18:53.207 --> 03:18:53.928]  I'm counting on you.
[03:18:54.228 --> 03:19:02.618]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.618 --> 03:19:04.079]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:04.079 --> 03:19:08.784]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.784 --> 03:19:11.868]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:19:12.348 --> 03:19:14.030]  I still have that energy.
[03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:34.168]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.668 --> 03:19:38.632]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:19:38.632 --> 03:19:42.355]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:19:42.355 --> 03:19:47.340]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:19:47.340 --> 03:19:50.083]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:19:50.083 --> 03:19:51.444]  Supermail Vitality.
[03:19:51.444 --> 03:19:56.889]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:56.889 --> 03:19:59.572]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.944 --> 03:20:25.606]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:25.606 --> 03:20:31.230]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from the People's Republic of California guest hosting this hour.
[03:20:31.230 --> 03:20:35.674]  Let's go right to Larry Klayman, founder of Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch.
[03:20:35.674 --> 03:20:40.718]  We want to talk about the Kavanaugh hearings and the circus around this entire
[03:20:42.384 --> 03:20:44.925]  Larry, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:44.925 --> 03:20:46.106]  Thank you, my good friend.
[03:20:46.106 --> 03:20:47.826]  Nice to see you.
[03:20:47.826 --> 03:20:49.627]  Great to have you here today.
[03:20:49.627 --> 03:20:54.289]  Larry, look, so many things have been happening in this process.
[03:20:54.289 --> 03:21:03.212]  To me, one of the most amazing spectacles is we see Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell have suddenly become Republicans and conservative Republicans.
[03:21:03.212 --> 03:21:06.233]  What things stand out to you from what you've observed so far?
[03:21:07.890 --> 03:21:10.191]  I'm very impressed with Lindsey Graham.
[03:21:10.191 --> 03:21:11.952]  Obviously, I've differed with him in the past.
[03:21:11.952 --> 03:21:16.254]  He was a bobsy twin of John McCain, which was not helpful.
[03:21:16.254 --> 03:21:18.755]  He believes that every war is worth fighting.
[03:21:18.755 --> 03:21:19.575]  But on the other hand,
[03:21:20.228 --> 03:21:21.348]  He took a strong stand.
[03:21:21.348 --> 03:21:22.829]  I admire what he did.
[03:21:22.829 --> 03:21:26.430]  Unquestionably, Joel, he perhaps is the best order in Congress.
[03:21:26.430 --> 03:21:34.033]  He's extremely bright, thinks like a trial lawyer, and he did a great service to the nation by coming to the defense of Judge Kavanaugh.
[03:21:34.033 --> 03:21:46.398]  And even though I've had reservations about Judge Kavanaugh and his views on the Fourth Amendment and mass surveillance, really, it's too late to have another nominee, and I'm quite pleased that it now appears that he's going to be confirmed as we speak.
[03:21:47.133 --> 03:21:52.757]  Senator Susan Collins from Maine is endorsing it, and that pretty much locks it up.
[03:21:52.757 --> 03:21:58.021]  Okay, tell me, why did the Republicans even agree in the first place to interview Ms.
[03:21:58.021 --> 03:22:01.364]  Blasey Ford when she had no corroborating witnesses?
[03:22:01.364 --> 03:22:05.547]  She could not even give a time or a date or a location for this allegation.
[03:22:05.547 --> 03:22:12.292]  Isn't there an evidentiary threshold you have to meet before they would agree to put on this extra hearing?
[03:22:13.382 --> 03:22:24.229]  Well, there should be, but you know, the silver lining in this whole sad affair, no pun intended, is that the radical elements of the Me Too movement have been discredited.
[03:22:24.229 --> 03:22:33.816]  The radical elements of the left, which foment sexual division, sexist division, racial division, are being discredited, as we speak.
[03:22:33.816 --> 03:22:40.921]  And the fault of the Me Too movement going out of control, running wild, are basically the fault of men, because we have rolled over
[03:22:41.678 --> 03:22:43.418]  We accept these allegations.
[03:22:43.418 --> 03:22:45.779]  We don't do anything about it when they're proven to be false.
[03:22:45.779 --> 03:22:47.319]  We don't push back.
[03:22:47.319 --> 03:22:48.420]  And it just got worse.
[03:22:48.420 --> 03:22:51.900]  And finally, this gets back to Lindsey Graham.
[03:22:51.900 --> 03:22:53.081]  There's been pushback.
[03:22:53.081 --> 03:22:55.101]  It's about time there's been pushback.
[03:22:55.101 --> 03:23:03.783]  Because while there are valid cases, such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacek and others, frankly, in my opinion, most of them are not.
[03:23:03.783 --> 03:23:10.505]  And they're trumped up, you know, by people that are disgruntled that their life didn't turn out the way they wanted or want their 15 minutes of fame.
[03:23:11.201 --> 03:23:14.903]  With the creepy porn lawyer Avenatti or something to that effect.
[03:23:14.903 --> 03:23:17.344]  So that's the way I see this thing right now.
[03:23:17.344 --> 03:23:27.288]  The fact that this even went forward the way it did was because men basically have been rolling over to these false allegations and dignifying it in an inappropriate way.
[03:23:27.288 --> 03:23:39.174]  And now you even have the leftist law professor Dershowitz saying that if this had been a Muslim appointee of the Supreme Court there wouldn't have been this kind of reaction because you would have had all these leftist groups claiming that
[03:23:40.183 --> 03:23:40.523]  I think so.
[03:23:58.078 --> 03:24:24.614]  Well, what I'm also taking away from this is if Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is not looking too good, she cannot even lift her head, it seems like, she mumbles, if she retires, passes away suddenly, or is deemed incapacitated, is this only a prelude for what the left will do if Trump tries to replace her seat with a conservative woman, for example?
[03:24:24.614 --> 03:24:26.395]  Will nominees even be afraid?
[03:24:27.175 --> 03:24:28.977]  It may be.
[03:24:28.977 --> 03:24:44.592]  On the other hand, Joel, everything's been dumbed down right now, you know, because what Clinton went through with the impeachment, Bill Clinton, you know, dumbed the body politic down.
[03:24:47.788 --> 03:24:55.474]  If you're going to be any kind of a public official, if you're going to be Larry Klayman, if you're going to be Joel Gilbert, if you're going to be Alex Jones, you're going to be attacked.
[03:24:55.474 --> 03:24:59.338]  And you have to accept that and look at what our founding fathers went through.
[03:24:59.338 --> 03:25:00.979]  They risked their lives.
[03:25:00.979 --> 03:25:05.743]  They pledged their honor and their fortunes to build a new nation.
[03:25:05.743 --> 03:25:10.647]  We can certainly withstand this if we have the courage to stand up and do that.
[03:25:10.647 --> 03:25:11.908]  And we have to do that.
[03:25:11.908 --> 03:25:15.391]  And I'm afraid, Joel, that, yes, it's going to get worse.
[03:25:16.056 --> 03:25:20.460]  And the violence in the streets that have been fomented by the left is going to increase.
[03:25:20.460 --> 03:25:21.881]  And I don't want to see it.
[03:25:21.881 --> 03:25:27.305]  I'm doing everything I can at Freedom Watch to stop that with our citizens going to juries and everything else.
[03:25:27.305 --> 03:25:32.889]  But I do believe that we are potentially headed for a violent civil war between left and right.
[03:25:32.889 --> 03:25:45.099]  And when it is triggered with regard to the right, and I don't condone it, and I advocate against it, but you're going to have people out in the streets that really know how to take care of business.
[03:25:49.547 --> 03:25:51.609]  We'll be taking calls this and next segment.
[03:25:51.609 --> 03:25:53.151]  It's 877-789-2539.
[03:25:53.151 --> 03:26:06.145]  Alex, our guest right now is Attorney Larry Klayman, founder of Judicial Watch and currently has Freedom Watch.
[03:26:06.145 --> 03:26:07.547]  Larry, how despicable
[03:26:08.388 --> 03:26:09.608]  A stunt, was it?
[03:26:09.608 --> 03:26:23.192]  And will Dianne Feinstein be held accountable for actually having this allegation in her office since July, and then simply waiting until the confirmation process was over to then present it?
[03:26:23.192 --> 03:26:29.134]  How despicable was that, and is that something that the Judiciary Committee will hold her accountable for?
[03:26:29.134 --> 03:26:30.654]  It's beyond despicable.
[03:26:30.654 --> 03:26:32.495]  It's not just Dianne Feinstein.
[03:26:32.495 --> 03:26:33.815]  It's Chuck Schumer.
[03:26:34.776 --> 03:26:36.816]  It's, you know, a lot of them on that committee.
[03:26:36.816 --> 03:26:41.057]  We saw how disgraceful and how vile and how dishonest they are.
[03:26:41.057 --> 03:26:49.139]  The Democratic Party has become a party of communists and radical feminists, radical pro-Islam, radical illegal immigrants.
[03:26:49.139 --> 03:26:50.539]  I mean, you name it.
[03:26:50.539 --> 03:26:56.240]  It's become a repository for every radical person and group in this country.
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:26:58.941]  And, you know, I take a nonpartisan view and approach
[03:26:59.634 --> 03:27:00.154]  Freedom Watch.
[03:27:00.154 --> 03:27:04.716]  So I'm not advocating who to vote for, because I can't do that as the head of a public interest group.
[03:27:04.716 --> 03:27:08.958]  But I'll tell you something, the Democratic Party, they become bullshittish.
[03:27:08.958 --> 03:27:11.059]  And we have a big threat.
[03:27:11.059 --> 03:27:17.802]  Now, in terms of Dianne Feinstein and her antics, and everybody else in that committee, they won't be held accountable.
[03:27:17.802 --> 03:27:25.605]  And as much as I like what Lindsey Graham said, he always prefaces it by saying she's a nice person, you know, or that person's a nice person, they're my friends.
[03:27:25.605 --> 03:27:26.645]  You know what?
[03:27:26.645 --> 03:27:28.246]  You're going to stand up for the American people.
[03:27:28.246 --> 03:27:28.546]  They're not
[03:27:29.164 --> 03:27:30.626]  Don't say they're nice people.
[03:27:30.626 --> 03:27:33.809]  These people are not nice people and they shouldn't be your friends.
[03:27:33.809 --> 03:27:35.671]  Get rid of the Senate club.
[03:27:35.671 --> 03:27:39.115]  So when I ran for the Senate, I said, I want to be a part of that club.
[03:27:39.115 --> 03:27:40.797]  I want to take a club to the Senate.
[03:27:40.797 --> 03:27:42.439]  And I hope we do that going forward.
[03:27:43.183 --> 03:27:44.905]  Okay, we've got about a minute left with Larry.
[03:27:44.905 --> 03:27:46.547]  Again, keep calling in.
[03:27:46.547 --> 03:27:50.472]  It's 877-789-2539.
[03:27:50.472 --> 03:28:01.484]  Larry, should Dr. Blasey Ford be investigated by the FBI to see if these allegations were possibly completely fabricated and wasting the time of the committee?
[03:28:01.484 --> 03:28:01.945]  Your opinion.
[03:28:02.839 --> 03:28:07.965]  As you investigate it, I'm not sure by the FBI because they've become very politicized as well.
[03:28:07.965 --> 03:28:10.649]  But yes, too much in our society.
[03:28:10.649 --> 03:28:19.940]  A woman can make an accusation in a family court proceeding or a proceeding such as this with the confirmation of the Supreme Court justice and walk away scot-free with no consequences.
[03:28:23.953 --> 03:28:25.554]  Okay Larry, thank you very much.
[03:28:25.554 --> 03:28:27.976]  We're running out of time for this segment.
[03:28:27.976 --> 03:28:28.857]  Keep calling in 877-789-ALEX.
[03:28:28.857 --> 03:28:31.119]  We'll be back after the break on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:53.331 --> 03:28:56.792]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[03:28:56.792 --> 03:28:59.613]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:28:59.613 --> 03:29:01.513]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:01.513 --> 03:29:06.574]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:29:06.574 --> 03:29:09.855]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:09.855 --> 03:29:16.117]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:29:16.117 --> 03:29:20.878]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work,
[03:29:21.038 --> 03:29:21.438]  We're good to go.

[03:29:54.245 --> 03:30:01.789]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:30:03.368 --> 03:30:14.235]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:30:14.235 --> 03:30:16.337]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[03:32:57.843 --> 03:33:00.484]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.982 --> 03:33:15.448]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:15.448 --> 03:33:17.189]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.189 --> 03:33:23.773]  Joel Gilbert, guest hosting this hour, coming to you from the People's Republic of California.
[03:33:23.773 --> 03:33:30.457]  You know me as a frequent guest of Alex, filmmaker of many conservative films, including Dreams from My Real Father.
[03:33:30.457 --> 03:33:32.658]  Be sure to get that in the Alex Jones store.
[03:33:33.476 --> 03:33:35.418]  And my latest film, of course, is still there.
[03:33:35.418 --> 03:33:40.181]  It's the Trump, The Art of the Insult.
[03:33:40.181 --> 03:33:46.466]  Look, what's happening, first of all, everyone keep calling in.
[03:33:46.466 --> 03:33:49.328]  It's 877-789-2539.
[03:33:49.328 --> 03:33:49.668]  877-789.
[03:33:49.668 --> 03:33:53.491]  Alex, we will be taking a lot of calls this half hour.
[03:33:53.491 --> 03:33:56.773]  First, I want to talk about the Kavanaugh hearings.
[03:33:56.773 --> 03:34:00.736]  What you saw on display the last week is what I call Obama's America.
[03:34:01.488 --> 03:34:05.371]  This is the America that Obama advocated for and wanted for.
[03:34:05.371 --> 03:34:19.402]  A permanent, hysterical, screaming protest with leftist activists activated, harassing people, and protesting non-stop.
[03:34:19.402 --> 03:34:21.904]  This is their model for the future.
[03:34:21.904 --> 03:34:25.066]  And we're seeing a lot of pushback, as Larry Klayman said.
[03:34:25.066 --> 03:34:27.348]  You saw how Senator Grassley and other Republicans
[03:34:28.143 --> 03:34:33.228]  We're so upset by the wholesale abandonment of respect and due process.
[03:34:33.228 --> 03:34:34.329]  The grassroots are upset.
[03:34:34.329 --> 03:34:36.511]  The public doesn't like it.
[03:34:36.511 --> 03:34:46.700]  The idea that you'll destroy a family man with an impeccable background, with baseless allegations, with no basis of any corroboration or fact whatsoever.
[03:34:46.700 --> 03:34:49.302]  But this is Obama's America, and you saw it.
[03:34:50.069 --> 03:34:58.155]  Let's look at a video excerpt from my movie, Dreams for My Real Father, and I call this the revolution for change.
[03:34:58.155 --> 03:35:01.778]  Let's look at Obama's America as a clip from my film.
[03:35:01.778 --> 03:35:05.942]  We're going to be taught how to organize.
[03:35:05.942 --> 03:35:13.568]  The Academy also preached Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals as a blueprint to transform America.
[03:35:15.289 --> 03:35:20.471]  The first rule of change is controversy.
[03:35:20.471 --> 03:35:25.134]  Change means movement, and movement means friction, and friction means heat.
[03:35:25.134 --> 03:35:41.181]  Olinsky defined the battle cry of change as a code word for socialism, and emphasized ruthless tactics for taking power that he'd learned from Al Capone's Chicago Mafia.
[03:35:42.924 --> 03:35:47.206]  Sending a powerful message that change is coming to America.
[03:35:47.206 --> 03:35:50.528]  Change does not happen from the top down.
[03:35:50.528 --> 03:35:52.249]  It happens from the bottom up.
[03:35:52.249 --> 03:35:56.090]  In stump speeches, I carried my message of change.
[03:35:56.090 --> 03:35:59.992]  The American people will embrace the change.
[03:35:59.992 --> 03:36:02.634]  And our time for change has come!
[03:36:02.634 --> 03:36:07.536]  The crowds cheered, even though they had no idea what I was talking about.
[03:36:09.395 --> 03:36:12.737]  Okay, that's an excerpt from Dreams for My Real Father.
[03:36:12.737 --> 03:36:16.340]  When Obama said change, nobody knew what he meant.
[03:36:16.340 --> 03:36:23.425]  And what he was talking about was the radical left, Saul Alinsky, rules for radicals, where you disrupt the system.
[03:36:23.425 --> 03:36:30.910]  You try to destroy the system and bring it down so you can rebuild from scratch a socialist society.
[03:36:30.910 --> 03:36:35.413]  Millions of people voted for Obama, had no idea who he was or what he represented.
[03:36:35.413 --> 03:36:37.615]  If you see my film, Dreams for My Real Father, you'll know
[03:36:38.427 --> 03:36:42.169]  Of course, that his real father was not the Kenyan goat herder.
[03:36:42.169 --> 03:36:49.893]  In fact, his father was the Russian agent named Frank Marshall Davis, who Obama admits radicalized him in his youth.
[03:36:49.893 --> 03:36:51.934]  Before I get into more, let's take a couple of calls.
[03:36:51.934 --> 03:36:56.156]  I'd like to go to CJ in Kansas City.
[03:36:56.156 --> 03:36:59.738]  CJ in Kansas City, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:36:59.738 --> 03:37:00.879]  Hey, what's going on, Joe?
[03:37:00.879 --> 03:37:02.079]  Appreciate you having me on.
[03:37:02.079 --> 03:37:03.860]  Thank you.
[03:37:03.860 --> 03:37:06.882]  Basically, I just wanted to make the point of
[03:37:07.432 --> 03:37:07.892]  Okay, uh, look.
[03:37:30.428 --> 03:37:42.415]  You have to understand, and you have to wonder, it's a good point because whenever their path to success is threatened, they will come up with anything and everything.
[03:37:42.415 --> 03:37:48.519]  Remember that the left achieved almost nothing by way of law and by way of Congress.
[03:37:48.519 --> 03:37:54.903]  Everything was achieved either on the Supreme Court or through Obama's executive orders, which were all illegal.
[03:37:55.626 --> 03:38:02.715]  And they want to continue to appoint radical leftist judges to force their agenda on the American people even though no one voted for it.
[03:38:02.715 --> 03:38:04.397]  So this is a great point.
[03:38:04.397 --> 03:38:07.982]  Let's go to another call before I get into more.
[03:38:07.982 --> 03:38:12.207]  How about, let's go with Al in North Dakota.
[03:38:12.207 --> 03:38:14.570]  Al, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:15.979 --> 03:38:16.579]  Uh, yes, sir.
[03:38:16.579 --> 03:38:18.339]  Okay, hello, Mr. Gilbert.
[03:38:18.339 --> 03:38:20.600]  Uh, yeah, thank you for taking the call.
[03:38:20.600 --> 03:38:23.160]  And, uh, listen, I just called in initially.
[03:38:23.160 --> 03:38:26.161]  I really, I didn't realize Larry Klain was going to leave so quickly, okay?
[03:38:26.161 --> 03:38:30.662]  But I just wanted to express my thanks to him for the work that he's done.
[03:38:30.662 --> 03:38:32.362]  I'm very familiar with him.
[03:38:32.362 --> 03:38:35.502]  I get his solicitations all the time.
[03:38:35.502 --> 03:38:43.484]  And, uh, I was so flabbergasted and disillusioned with Jeff Sessions, and I was just so glad that Larry Klain is there to do the work that he does.
[03:38:44.494 --> 03:38:45.595]  And thank you, sir.
[03:38:45.595 --> 03:38:47.716]  You know, I'm on the phone right here listening to you.
[03:38:47.716 --> 03:39:01.724]  I just... You're the author of a book where... You were the one that pointed out that Frank Marshall Davis is actually the... Probably the biological and definitely the spiritual father of Barack Obama, correct?
[03:39:01.724 --> 03:39:02.425]  That's correct.
[03:39:02.425 --> 03:39:03.966]  Dreams from My Real Father.
[03:39:03.966 --> 03:39:04.546]  It's a film.
[03:39:04.546 --> 03:39:07.508]  You can get it in the InfoWars store.
[03:39:07.508 --> 03:39:12.170]  And, uh... Look, Obama admits he was radicalized by Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:39:12.170 --> 03:39:12.931]  Davis was a...
[03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:31.225]  Chicago communists that was ordered to Hawaii by the Russian government to try to start a Revolution in Hawaii to get rid of the US Naval forces by starting a dock worker strike He was a Soviet agent, and he raised Barack Obama and no doubt when you look at Obama's policies.
[03:39:31.225 --> 03:39:39.727]  He radicalized him into this worldview of socialism and communism So I appreciate the call look
[03:39:41.095 --> 03:39:45.496]  Fundamental to our Constitution, of course, is free speech.
[03:39:45.496 --> 03:39:47.316]  Alex has been talking about it.
[03:39:47.316 --> 03:39:50.517]  Without free speech, we're not free.
[03:39:50.517 --> 03:39:53.438]  That's why it's the First Amendment, the very first one.
[03:39:53.438 --> 03:39:59.259]  And you saw that Alex has been banned from PayPal, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, you name it.
[03:39:59.259 --> 03:40:01.700]  And don't think it's not a test case.
[03:40:01.700 --> 03:40:03.440]  The left likes to do test cases.
[03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:07.441]  Don't forget they did a test case with the IRS in 2012.
[03:40:07.441 --> 03:40:10.742]  Obama used the IRS to shut down the conservative movement.
[03:40:11.610 --> 03:40:20.692]  I want to shut down the ability of conservatives to organize in 2012 after he got wiped out in 2010 by the Tea Party.
[03:40:20.692 --> 03:40:22.413]  That was their test case.
[03:40:22.413 --> 03:40:25.133]  There was very little pushback from Republicans.
[03:40:25.133 --> 03:40:27.394]  Obama said, well, you know, we're going to investigate this.
[03:40:27.394 --> 03:40:28.934]  Nothing ever happened.
[03:40:28.934 --> 03:40:31.915]  And the Republicans kind of dropped it.
[03:40:31.915 --> 03:40:34.996]  So having succeeded in their test case, they came back.
[03:40:35.777 --> 03:40:47.685]  In 2016, with the FBI, DOJ, CIA, all the tools of state mobilized to prevent, we the people, to prevent Donald Trump from succeeding.
[03:40:47.685 --> 03:40:50.968]  And Donald Trump, it's not even about Donald Trump.
[03:40:50.968 --> 03:40:58.753]  He's just in the way between the people who wanted constitutional government restored and the people.
[03:40:59.361 --> 03:41:08.198]  So it's very important that people oppose any limitations on free speech to the Alex Jones Show or anyone else because it's simply a test case.
[03:41:08.198 --> 03:41:09.199]  If they see that there's no
[03:41:10.023 --> 03:41:16.286]  Popular demand that Alex be allowed to have access to all these platforms.
[03:41:16.286 --> 03:41:17.826]  The Gateway Pundit will be next.
[03:41:17.826 --> 03:41:19.647]  Then it's World Net Daily.
[03:41:19.647 --> 03:41:20.988]  Then it's back to Fox News.
[03:41:20.988 --> 03:41:24.709]  Obama tried to shut down Fox News with a number of attacks.
[03:41:24.709 --> 03:41:25.430]  They didn't work.
[03:41:25.430 --> 03:41:27.311]  But they'll be back for Fox News.
[03:41:27.311 --> 03:41:29.131]  So that's how the left operates.
[03:41:29.131 --> 03:41:30.192]  They cannot function
[03:41:30.832 --> 03:41:34.975]  In a free society where truth and reality exist.
[03:41:34.975 --> 03:41:38.097]  Because their policies are not based on truth and reality.
[03:41:38.097 --> 03:41:39.317]  They're based on this fantasy.
[03:41:39.317 --> 03:41:43.800]  You may have seen my film, There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:41:43.800 --> 03:41:47.942]  It's the idea that they'll create the perfect world, the perfect society.
[03:41:47.942 --> 03:41:58.489]  And progressives murdered 150 million people in peacetime in the 20th century because they wouldn't fit into this perfect world, perfect society.
[03:41:59.125 --> 03:42:10.878]  In Cambodia they killed everyone who had glasses, because if you had glasses you could read, and that meant you were intelligent, you knew something, and they wanted to start over with perfect new human beings.
[03:42:10.878 --> 03:42:14.623]  So we have to understand that reality and truth are important.
[03:42:14.623 --> 03:42:19.068]  When you look at, when it's hysteria, when it's lies, it leads to
[03:42:20.606 --> 03:42:22.887]  Destruction and the end of freedom.
[03:42:22.887 --> 03:42:29.829]  So everyone, please make sure you do everything you can to demand that Alex Jones be let back on all the other platforms.
[03:42:29.829 --> 03:42:30.390]  Keep calling in.
[03:42:30.390 --> 03:42:32.650]  We're going to take more calls.
[03:42:32.650 --> 03:42:34.831]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:42:34.831 --> 03:42:40.353]  Be back and we'll keep talking about Obama's America that you saw on display in the Kavanaugh hearings.
[03:42:40.353 --> 03:42:42.254]  We'll be taking more calls right after the break.
[03:42:43.692 --> 03:42:50.735]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:42:58.624 --> 03:43:07.307]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:43:07.307 --> 03:43:09.268]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:43:09.268 --> 03:43:12.729]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:43:12.729 --> 03:43:15.350]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:43:15.350 --> 03:43:17.651]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:43:17.651 --> 03:43:24.594]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[03:43:25.174 --> 03:43:34.938]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:43:34.938 --> 03:43:36.118]  We'll win.
[03:43:36.118 --> 03:43:38.439]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:43:38.439 --> 03:43:46.202]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:43:46.202 --> 03:43:49.863]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[03:43:49.863 --> 03:43:51.423]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:43:51.423 --> 03:43:52.284]  We need your support.
[03:43:52.284 --> 03:43:52.804]  I'm counting on you.

[03:45:02.397 --> 03:45:03.858]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:03.858 --> 03:45:08.541]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:45:08.541 --> 03:45:13.805]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.

[03:46:01.244 --> 03:46:04.305]  From deep earth, crystals between 7 and 12,000 feet.
[03:46:04.305 --> 03:46:05.786]  It's very hard for me to get.
[03:46:05.786 --> 03:46:07.666]  It's the good halogen.
[03:46:07.666 --> 03:46:09.787]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[03:46:09.787 --> 03:46:16.330]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[03:46:16.330 --> 03:46:18.931]  Bio-Truth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[03:46:18.931 --> 03:46:20.352]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[03:46:21.653 --> 03:46:27.378]  It's seen as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[03:46:27.378 --> 03:46:29.180]  So these go incredibly well together.
[03:46:29.180 --> 03:46:30.742]  We have a combo of those.
[03:46:30.742 --> 03:46:32.123]  Just experience it for yourself.
[03:46:32.123 --> 03:46:34.846]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[03:46:34.846 --> 03:46:35.887]  Very simple stuff.
[03:46:35.887 --> 03:46:37.529]  Filter your water.
[03:46:37.529 --> 03:46:39.591]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[03:46:39.591 --> 03:46:40.912]  Best out there for the price.
[03:46:40.912 --> 03:46:42.153]  When I say it's the last run,
[03:46:43.345 --> 03:46:44.946]  I think it'll be six months to a year until we get more.
[03:46:44.946 --> 03:46:45.767]  I hope we get more.
[03:46:45.767 --> 03:46:47.088]  This is the last run it looks like.
[03:46:47.088 --> 03:46:47.948]  Survival Show next week.
[03:46:47.948 --> 03:46:49.990]  InfoWarsTour.com or InfoWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[03:46:49.990 --> 03:46:51.871]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.497 --> 03:47:30.789]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:30.789 --> 03:47:33.012]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.012 --> 03:47:33.873]  Joel Gilbert.
[03:47:34.580 --> 03:47:39.782]  Guest hosting again today from the People's Republic of California in Los Angeles.
[03:47:39.782 --> 03:47:40.442]  Keep calling in.
[03:47:40.442 --> 03:47:42.103]  We'll take a lot of calls this segment.
[03:47:42.103 --> 03:47:45.064]  It's 877-789-2539.
[03:47:45.064 --> 03:47:48.945]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:47:48.945 --> 03:47:54.807]  On a very busy news day that the Kavanaugh vote is going forward.
[03:47:54.807 --> 03:47:58.989]  We saw Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham become conservative Republicans finally.
[03:47:59.813 --> 03:48:00.833]  And a lot going on.
[03:48:00.833 --> 03:48:02.254]  Let's go straight to some callers.
[03:48:02.254 --> 03:48:04.795]  Let's take Todd in North Carolina.
[03:48:04.795 --> 03:48:06.035]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:48:06.035 --> 03:48:07.876]  Todd, go ahead.
[03:48:07.876 --> 03:48:08.676]  Hey, Joel.
[03:48:08.676 --> 03:48:10.737]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:48:10.737 --> 03:48:14.678]  I appreciate all your work.
[03:48:14.678 --> 03:48:27.283]  One thing I'd love to see you do one of these days is some sort of an investigation into Peter Drucker, the business... What would you call him?
[03:48:28.598 --> 03:48:41.809]  I wrote a bunch of books on business skills and everything, but anyhow, his influence over the modern megachurch, and bringing in the idea of humanism and social justice into the megachurch.
[03:48:41.809 --> 03:48:51.076]  But the issue that I mentioned to the screener was in regards to, is Kavanaugh a Trojan horse?
[03:48:51.076 --> 03:48:55.900]  Kind of like Kenya and the birth certificate were a Trojan horse for
[03:48:57.051 --> 03:49:01.272]  Who Obama's real father was, Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:49:01.272 --> 03:49:01.552]  Right.
[03:49:01.552 --> 03:49:06.473]  Well, look, Kavanaugh was a Bush guy, okay?
[03:49:06.473 --> 03:49:11.615]  So the Bush guys are always people that can cave in or go one way or the other.
[03:49:11.615 --> 03:49:12.855]  You've got to understand that.
[03:49:12.855 --> 03:49:20.277]  We even saw Kavanaugh wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal essentially apologizing for his defense, defending himself.
[03:49:21.138 --> 03:49:35.821]  Uh, in the face of criticism from Democrats that he wasn't very nice when he defended himself from the ruthless heinous allegations of attacking women and gang rapes and all this nonsense.
[03:49:36.361 --> 03:49:40.984]  So, you can see some people are easily swayed or will cave in.
[03:49:40.984 --> 03:49:45.988]  And certainly Kavanaugh is vulnerable to that like any of the Bush-era type of people.
[03:49:45.988 --> 03:49:51.932]  Sometimes when they're pushed to, when their back is against the wall, they do stand up for themselves.
[03:49:51.932 --> 03:49:57.275]  As you saw, Lindsey Graham and even Mitch McConnell have come out as strong conservatives.
[03:49:57.275 --> 03:50:00.657]  So, you're definitely going to have to keep your eyes on Kavanaugh to see what he does.
[03:50:00.657 --> 03:50:04.060]  And thanks for the mention of Dreamster, my real father.
[03:50:06.943 --> 03:50:12.785]  Obama was raised and radicalized by a Soviet agent, Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:50:12.785 --> 03:50:19.927]  I think I've shown a mountain of evidence that in addition to that, it was his biological father, and everything about Obama was a complete lie.
[03:50:19.927 --> 03:50:22.128]  But we can do, I can do another hour on that one.
[03:50:22.128 --> 03:50:24.869]  Let's take another call from Desiree.
[03:50:24.869 --> 03:50:26.109]  Desiree here in California.
[03:50:26.109 --> 03:50:28.710]  Go ahead, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:30.831]  Oh yes, Joe, can you hear me?
[03:50:30.831 --> 03:50:32.431]  Yes, how are you today?
[03:50:32.431 --> 03:50:32.711]  Yes.
[03:50:32.711 --> 03:50:33.691]  Oh, I'm great!
[03:50:33.691 --> 03:50:34.112]  I'm great.
[03:50:34.112 --> 03:50:35.252]  I'm so glad I finally got through.
[03:50:36.252 --> 03:50:39.773]  I was actually calling because I just wanted to say something.
[03:50:39.773 --> 03:50:41.053]  Two things, actually.
[03:50:41.053 --> 03:50:51.235]  First is, you know, I have always been independent and I've always really voted more so Democratic on the Democratic side for the last couple years.
[03:50:51.235 --> 03:51:03.058]  But, you know, what I'm seeing right now with this, the Kavanaugh hearings and everything that's going on, you know, I'm a single mom and I have a son.
[03:51:03.058 --> 03:51:03.218]  He's 12.
[03:51:04.688 --> 03:51:06.710]  It's really disturbing to me.
[03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:13.074]  So that really has shifted my focus on what's happening.
[03:51:13.074 --> 03:51:14.955]  I think it's horrible.
[03:51:14.955 --> 03:51:21.620]  And I think that more of the independents are going to be swinging to the right because of that.
[03:51:21.620 --> 03:51:23.341]  That's just my personal opinion.
[03:51:23.341 --> 03:51:27.424]  And that's what I'm seeing for myself.
[03:51:27.424 --> 03:51:33.188]  You know, because I just basically destroying a man's life over baseless accusations.
[03:51:33.188 --> 03:51:34.049]  It's horrible.
[03:51:34.716 --> 03:51:37.377]  And it just made me really sad when I watched him on TV.
[03:51:37.377 --> 03:51:39.517]  I was almost crying.
[03:51:39.517 --> 03:51:40.538]  Thanks for the call, Desiree.
[03:51:40.538 --> 03:51:49.400]  I mean, I think you're typical of a lot of people that are very normal Americans that are deplorables, even though they didn't know it.
[03:51:49.400 --> 03:51:52.461]  That you have some good gut instincts and a lot of common sense.
[03:51:52.461 --> 03:52:00.704]  And once you see the face of the Democrat Party, the true radicalism coming out, don't think that Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein and
[03:52:01.471 --> 03:52:06.113]  You know, Coons and all these guys all of a sudden became leftist radicals.
[03:52:06.113 --> 03:52:09.314]  They were practicing before something called stealth socialism.
[03:52:09.314 --> 03:52:11.415]  And that's how Obama got elected in the first place.
[03:52:11.415 --> 03:52:13.716]  He said, I'm going to cut the deficit in half.
[03:52:13.716 --> 03:52:16.197]  Marriage is between a man and a woman and God.
[03:52:16.197 --> 03:52:18.218]  I'm going to obey the Constitution.
[03:52:18.218 --> 03:52:20.919]  It was an intentional lie to get elected.
[03:52:20.919 --> 03:52:23.700]  But they used to keep their socialism to themselves.
[03:52:23.700 --> 03:52:26.901]  They wouldn't tell you outright, I want a revolution.
[03:52:26.901 --> 03:52:28.702]  I want to destroy the free market system.
[03:52:29.364 --> 03:52:30.765]  Now they're just coming out in the open.
[03:52:30.765 --> 03:52:36.449]  This is part of that Trump derangement syndrome that they just can't help themselves anymore.
[03:52:36.449 --> 03:52:38.351]  So you can see the radicalism coming out.
[03:52:38.351 --> 03:52:40.953]  And I think it's turning off mainstream America.
[03:52:40.953 --> 03:52:45.836]  And thank goodness people like yourself have a chance to really see these people for who they are.
[03:52:45.836 --> 03:52:52.161]  And you're not going to throw away your vote and then be thrown under the bus like Obama did to all of his voters.
[03:52:52.161 --> 03:52:54.783]  Let's go on to Patricia in Arizona.
[03:52:54.783 --> 03:52:56.104]  Patricia, go ahead.
[03:52:56.104 --> 03:52:58.106]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:52:58.106 --> 03:52:58.366]  Hi.
[03:52:59.389 --> 03:53:10.855]  I'm calling from Arizona and I wanted to let you know that a friend of mine went to go vote in the primaries and they told him he was not registered as a Republican.
[03:53:10.855 --> 03:53:14.517]  And he's been registered as a Republican for years.
[03:53:14.517 --> 03:53:16.799]  And they said, no, you're an Independent.
[03:53:16.799 --> 03:53:20.621]  And then they gave him a ballot that didn't have any names on it.
[03:53:20.621 --> 03:53:23.202]  So there was nothing for him to vote for.
[03:53:23.202 --> 03:53:24.723]  And I'm wondering if this isn't
[03:53:25.777 --> 03:53:39.128]  How they plan to do another segment of their voter fraud and people should, I wanted to bring the point out that people should probably check and make sure they're registered as a Republican before they go to vote.
[03:53:39.128 --> 03:53:40.610]  Okay, Patricia, thanks for the call.
[03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:41.631]  It's an excellent point.
[03:53:41.631 --> 03:53:49.718]  I've been talking about this and warning about this, it's in all my films, that the radical left, their policies don't work.
[03:53:49.718 --> 03:53:51.219]  They have no basis in reality.
[03:53:51.787 --> 03:54:00.075]  So they have to force their agenda on the American people, either through lying about it to get elected, or through voter fraud.
[03:54:00.075 --> 03:54:05.260]  And the left has, you know, made a big effort over the past few years to extend the voting.
[03:54:05.260 --> 03:54:08.263]  Instead of for one day, it's one week, then it's three weeks.
[03:54:08.263 --> 03:54:14.269]  Now they have early vote, so they can register illegals to vote, and then you can vote by mail.
[03:54:14.269 --> 03:54:15.230]  There's no way to track them.
[03:54:16.116 --> 03:54:20.738]  This is their only path to power is voter fraud.
[03:54:20.738 --> 03:54:33.502]  And what you're telling me is just one of many tactics I've heard of where they try to control the voting booths and the voting system, as well as the voting machines, as well as the early vote process.
[03:54:33.502 --> 03:54:34.242]  It never ends.
[03:54:34.242 --> 03:54:37.524]  Now, Donald Trump, when he was elected, he tried very hard to
[03:54:38.934 --> 03:54:39.915]  Clean it up.
[03:54:39.915 --> 03:54:42.357]  And a lot of the states would not even cooperate.
[03:54:42.357 --> 03:54:45.880]  So it remains a very grave danger.
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:53.526]  You can literally, you could see a situation where the polls will show that Republicans are winning big time.
[03:54:53.526 --> 03:54:57.269]  And then on election day, they could lose by a couple percentage points.
[03:54:57.269 --> 03:54:59.231]  And if they do, it'll be because of voter fraud.
[03:54:59.801 --> 03:55:04.163]  So the system has to be cleaned up and has to be much more vigilant.
[03:55:04.163 --> 03:55:07.125]  And it's a constant problem.
[03:55:07.125 --> 03:55:14.549]  If it's not voter fraud, it's using the tools of state, the IRS and FBI to manipulate the elections on and on.
[03:55:14.549 --> 03:55:21.273]  And then they say, oh, well, Donald Trump was hanging out with Putin and he was the one trying to manipulate the elections.
[03:55:21.273 --> 03:55:22.934]  You know, it's quite the opposite.
[03:55:22.934 --> 03:55:24.975]  Let's go to another caller.
[03:55:24.975 --> 03:55:27.916]  How about let's go to John in Colorado.
[03:55:27.916 --> 03:55:29.177]  John, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:55:30.856 --> 03:55:32.417]  Yes, I'm here.
[03:55:32.417 --> 03:55:43.021]  First, I want to say to Judge Brett Kavanaugh is, you know, my prayers are out there for him and his family.
[03:55:43.021 --> 03:55:48.223]  And my prayers are out there also for Dr. Ford's family and all that they have gone through.
[03:55:48.223 --> 03:55:56.027]  I think it's disgraceful and constitutional for what both of their families have been drugged through, through the Democrat Party.
[03:55:56.027 --> 03:55:58.628]  That being said, you know, I think
[03:55:59.443 --> 03:56:09.086]  Moving on to the Obama America, I think he lost America in the last two years of his presidency, and that's probably what got President Trump elected.
[03:56:09.086 --> 03:56:16.909]  Moving on from that, I think this is now a Trump America, and we're moving on, and people are finding out who the true Democrats are.
[03:56:16.909 --> 03:56:25.731]  They are, like Alex Jones and many parties and spokespeople on his show have said, they will expose themselves, and they have exposed themselves.
[03:56:28.388 --> 03:56:32.910]  You know, it said a lot about that particular party in itself.
[03:56:32.910 --> 03:56:34.290]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[03:56:34.290 --> 03:56:36.011]  We only got a few seconds left.
[03:56:36.011 --> 03:56:37.691]  Thanks for the call.
[03:56:37.691 --> 03:56:41.793]  Look, that's a good summation of what we've been talking about for the full hour.
[03:56:41.793 --> 03:56:45.034]  That the hearing itself was a little bit absurd.
[03:56:45.034 --> 03:56:46.835]  There was no corroboration.
[03:56:46.835 --> 03:56:51.176]  She didn't even know what date this thing happened, where it was located.
[03:56:51.176 --> 03:56:52.897]  There certainly should have been a threshold that
[03:56:53.689 --> 03:56:58.851]  They would have to have had time to look into this to see if it was even worthy of bringing before the committee.
[03:56:58.851 --> 03:57:05.452]  I think had they had time to investigate, they would have found that there was no point of even bringing this up in the first place.
[03:57:05.452 --> 03:57:08.493]  And of course, that was the Democrats' strategy to begin with.
[03:57:08.493 --> 03:57:17.516]  Let's hold this until the hearing is over and then try to throw the process and even the midterms into chaos and we'll, you know, we're going to
[03:57:18.388 --> 03:57:23.052]  You know, get our people out to vote and so on, but it looks like it may be backfiring.
[03:57:23.052 --> 03:57:25.775]  So it's been a very interesting week.
[03:57:25.775 --> 03:57:27.216]  Thank you for being here.
[03:57:27.216 --> 03:57:29.438]  I'll be back in two weeks time.
[03:57:29.438 --> 03:57:33.642]  Welcome to everyone who's coming on mute to the website Infowars.com.
[03:57:33.642 --> 03:57:34.763]  Go to the store.
[03:57:34.763 --> 03:57:35.444]  I'm Joel Gilbert.
[03:57:35.444 --> 03:57:36.125]  Thanks for being here.
[03:57:47.182 --> 03:57:52.904]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:57:52.904 --> 03:58:00.766]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:58:00.766 --> 03:58:03.927]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:58:04.087 --> 03:58:09.391]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:58:09.391 --> 03:58:12.173]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
