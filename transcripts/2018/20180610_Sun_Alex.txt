[00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:12.508]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:43.422]  This is where men are made.
[00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:48.946]  And it's in these historic times where men become heroes and legends.
[00:00:48.946 --> 00:01:00.154]  What will you say when your ancestors and your lineage asks you what you did in these great times?
[00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:02.116]  You know, there's so much going on right now.
[00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.625]  There's so many different ways that you can impact the world.
[00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:06.925]  It doesn't even have to be in politics.
[00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:10.327]  You could start a garden and teach other people how to garden.
[00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:17.171]  You could raise awareness about the negative side effects of the wireless and cell phone technology.
[00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:23.795]  You don't even have to step into the nasty ring of politics to change the world.
[00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:28.258]  So what are you doing right now in these historic times?
[00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:34.796]  Now, this is a cigar.
[00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:38.718]  Now, me personally, I like to smoke cigars.
[00:01:38.718 --> 00:01:40.559]  What do you like to do with cigars, Bill?
[00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:49.484]  If Monica Lewinsky says that you used a cigar as a sexual aid with her in the Oval Office area, would she be blind?
[00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.825]  Yes, no, or won't answer.
[00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:53.306]  I will revert to my former statement.
[00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:58.889]  If Monica Lewinsky says that you had phone sex with her, would she be blind?
[00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:08.580]  Well, that is, at least in general terms, I think is covered by my statement.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.162]  I addressed that in my statement, and that, I don't believe is... Let me define phone sex for purposes of my question.
[00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:22.805]  Phone sex occurs when a party to a phone conversation masturbates while the other party is talking in a sexually explicit manner.
[00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:28.346]  And the question is, if Monica Lewinsky says that you had phone sex with her, would she be lying?
[00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:29.947]  I think that is covered by my statement.
[00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:38.429]  So there you go.
[00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:48.018]  Apparently Bill Clinton... Well, let's just say if Bill Clinton offers you a cigar, you might want to turn it down.
[00:02:48.018 --> 00:02:48.939]  There he is, though.
[00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:49.700]  Good old Bill.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.464]  Now, I've got my Bill Clinton rape t-shirt on.
[00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:54.465]  Can we get a look at this?
[00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:55.826]  Let me just move over here.
[00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:57.788]  There you go, right there.
[00:02:57.788 --> 00:02:59.089]  Right there.
[00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.952]  Now, this used to be sold at Infowarsstore.com, but we're sold out.
[00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.231]  There's other t-shirts you can get at Infowarsstore.com right now that will soon be sold out.
[00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:11.171]  Once-in-a-lifetime type of a purchase, a Bill Clinton rape t-shirt right here.
[00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.952]  Now, why am I talking about Bill Clinton?
[00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:16.132]  Now, Bill Clinton is on a book tour right now.
[00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:31.915]  This disgraced bum of a president, a bum, a white trash pick bum, who made a mockery of the White House, didn't know how to properly use a cigar, and somehow, magically,
[00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:34.922]  Maybe it was a magic wand!
[00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:37.784]  The media never gave Bill a hard time.
[00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.445]  The Me Too movement.
[00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:48.372]  There was no Me Too movement during Bill Clinton, when he was settling rape cases, when he was flying on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:03:48.372 --> 00:03:50.873]  No!
[00:03:50.873 --> 00:03:51.994]  No.
[00:03:51.994 --> 00:03:57.998]  But... Now they're saying, is Bill Clinton finally having his Me Too movement?
[00:03:57.998 --> 00:04:01.400]  Is it finally catching up to Bill?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.601]  Well...
[00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:14.397]  I don't know, but when Bill Clinton goes to a book tour now, he's got people that stand up and say, Bill, what were you doing on the Lolita Express 26 times?
[00:04:14.397 --> 00:04:23.481]  So Bill Clinton is in Austin, Texas tonight, and InfoWars is having a MeToo protest, hashtag MeToo protest, outside of the Bass Concert Hall.
[00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:24.582]  So join me tonight.
[00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:43.593]  Put on your favorite Bill Clinton rape t-shirt, head on down to the Bass Concert Hall in Austin, Texas, and stand outside the crowd to let them know that Bill Clinton is a rapist, and he's settled rape cases, and he's flown on the Lolita Express with the sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:04:44.774 --> 00:04:49.299]  Bill and Hillary Clinton, tight friends with Harvey Weinstein, big donor of the Democrat Party.
[00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:55.064]  We're not going to let Bill Clinton come to Austin, Texas and not let the people of Austin know who Bill Clinton really is.
[00:04:55.064 --> 00:04:56.645]  We'll be back on the other side with Alex Jones.
[00:04:56.645 --> 00:04:57.226]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:02.969]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:07.691 --> 00:06:09.875]  Because there is a war on.
[00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:10.817]  Or you're mine.
[00:06:12.922 --> 00:06:15.043]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:15.043 --> 00:06:24.388]  They've been trying to tell you that being pro-America was a bad thing, being nationalist was a bad thing, and you're causing the climate to change and kill the earth.
[00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:27.890]  You're causing all the bad things to happen because you're an American patriot.
[00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.810]  Well, no.
[00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.971]  We're not buying that anymore.
[00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:31.772]  Trump's not buying that anymore.
[00:06:31.772 --> 00:06:35.894]  Trump goes to the G-Summit, stands up for American nationalism and American pride.
[00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:37.635]  Here's Alex Jones with the latest report.
[00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:42.818]  We're live, we're broadcasting, worldwide it is.
[00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:51.714]  A momentous day right now, and the whole world is on the edge of its seat.
[00:06:51.714 --> 00:06:59.895]  If you've actually been studying geopolitical systems, the different power structures, the entire globalist paradigm is being overthrown.
[00:06:59.895 --> 00:07:09.838]  In a moment, I'm going to show you globalist leaders, George Soros and others, admitting they are suffering Napoleon Bonaparte-level defeats at the Battle of Waterloo.
[00:07:10.802 --> 00:07:21.386]  This is devastating and turning back the clock on their world government tyranny 60 years and accelerating us towards the new renaissance.
[00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:30.209]  I'm going to let people in on some analysis that I haven't told anybody yet, but I think now is the time.
[00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:37.091]  And this is so sophisticated that I haven't really talked about it because it's so complex, but it's also so simple.
[00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:40.507]  The United States created globalism.
[00:07:40.507 --> 00:07:42.930]  It created what is known as the New World Order.
[00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:50.218]  Robber barons manipulated our ruling class intelligentsia into doing it after World War I and World War II with the League of Nations and the UN.
[00:07:52.423 --> 00:07:55.725]  In the name of stopping World War.
[00:07:55.725 --> 00:08:06.173]  But then, in the last few decades, the intelligentsia and the families that went along with it, most of them aren't evil, they realized that the whole thing was a giant fraud and a huge lie.
[00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:13.999]  And that globalism was really a plan to destroy nation states, consolidate control, and destroy every level of independence.
[00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:20.724]  And so basically, the robber barons set up the global corporate governance to be commanded from England, the US, and Europe.
[00:08:22.543 --> 00:08:30.288]  And to depopulate the third world to be run out of the West, but they meant to dominate the West at the same time.
[00:08:30.288 --> 00:08:50.601]  Instead, Trump and US intelligence agencies and other patriots in the UK are moving forward, ladies and gentlemen, in a big way to roll that back up, to take control of those systems that were set up for the betterment of the planet and for real, open, free trade and real peace.
[00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:51.502]  And so the promise
[00:08:52.222 --> 00:09:13.079]  That the globalists first sold but were lying about they wanted the power for themselves is now being taken control of and then Trump is being a very square dealer with all of these people and he is just point-blank talking to them and being honest about the whole plan and saying we just want to deal with you from a straightforward position.
[00:09:15.672 --> 00:09:17.133]  And that's why you see it all coming out.
[00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:27.441]  That's why two years ago you saw in the Financial Times of London and all the other top globalist publications that if Trump got elected, it would be the final domino falling to bring down their corporate world government.
[00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:29.003]  That's anti-free market.
[00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:30.444]  That's not liberal.
[00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:31.965]  That's not open and free.
[00:09:31.965 --> 00:09:33.466]  It says it's all those things.
[00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:34.607]  It's the opposite.
[00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:37.109]  It's total centralization in their own words.
[00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:38.890]  So you see Wikileaks come out from U.S.
[00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.511]  intelligence, not the Russians.
[00:09:41.452 --> 00:09:48.642]  And now you've seen Trump, now that he's proven Russiagate was a fraud, that Spygate is real, saying we should have the Russians in the G8.
[00:09:48.642 --> 00:09:56.512]  Obama set up the fall of Ukraine, overthrowing it, and triggered the Russians having to come in to take control of the area they've had for 500 years, where Russia was founded in.
[00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:01.078]  The area of Eastern Ukraine.
[00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:07.724]  All of this is now accelerating as the economy comes back, as sovereignty comes back, as political correctness begins to get its back broken.
[00:10:07.724 --> 00:10:15.670]  It had to happen because we were going into the endgame of globalism, breaking up families, bankrupting people, making people poor, taking full control.
[00:10:16.752 --> 00:10:25.185]  Now, from a Machiavellian view, you could say this was all set up and sold to the world to make China and all these other countries think they'd be part of the world government and dominate the U.S.
[00:10:25.185 --> 00:10:30.814]  But really, it was a globalist corporate plan to infiltrate them for their final takedown.
[00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:34.119]  That's not what was really being planned.
[00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:36.541]  The globalists were double-crossing us, moving everything to China.
[00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:39.063]  China was breaking all its agreements about military expansion.
[00:10:39.063 --> 00:10:44.928]  They were supposed to get the Panama Canal, all the deepwater ports, all the major trade, 98% of the rare earth minerals.
[00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:46.089]  They were to dominate that.
[00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:47.590]  Kind of the globalist rollerball model.
[00:10:48.852 --> 00:10:50.673]  Of an interconnected, interdependent world.
[00:10:50.673 --> 00:10:51.154]  The U.S.
[00:10:51.154 --> 00:10:54.476]  was to be this big global military police power, but de-industrialized.
[00:10:54.476 --> 00:10:57.778]  These were all mainline CFR agreements.
[00:10:57.778 --> 00:11:05.964]  But we were betrayed at every point by the authoritarian EU, that's the new Soviet Union, by the communist Chinese, who are the biggest mass murderers in history.
[00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:18.092]  Hollywood sold out to them because the left has a hatred for America, and a hatred for Christians, and a hatred for the West, because they want to dominate it, because it's more powerful and more beautiful than they are, with their sick demonic culture of globalism.
[00:11:18.972 --> 00:11:32.560]  And so they openly want to destroy that, so that sickness inside globalism kept sabotaging even the better aims of globalism, because it was always sabotaging the West that was the progenitor and the fount of all their great success.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:43.466]  So that's been recognized, the cancer of the leftist, Saul Alinsky, communist globalism, founded by the big foundations, funded by the Rockefellers and others, and their beef with Christianity,
[00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:48.808]  And they're beef with the West, and they're beef wanting to dominate it, subvert it, and control it.
[00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:57.031]  As an act of dominance, because the West is so much open, so beautiful, so great, so productive, they can't compete with an open free market society.
[00:11:57.031 --> 00:12:01.233]  They are monopoly men, as John D. Rockefeller I said, and competition is a sin.
[00:12:02.353 --> 00:12:08.157]  So I'm going to show you amazing photos and amazing articles here for a few minutes that will totally and absolutely blow you away.
[00:12:08.157 --> 00:12:11.218]  We're checking out of this hotel right now.
[00:12:11.218 --> 00:12:12.599]  Was that the car getting here?
[00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:14.540]  Okay, tell them we'll be there.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.303]  And so I'm going to finish this up real quick, but more is coming tonight.
[00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:23.265]  I know it's already, you know, eight, nine o'clock at night, you know, in the United States.
[00:12:23.265 --> 00:12:27.708]  I'm out here in the Pacific Ocean with my family, but I'm working the whole time because history is happening.
[00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:28.989]  But let's go ahead and go to this right now.
[00:12:32.046 --> 00:12:34.028]  Now, a picture tells a trillion words.
[00:12:34.028 --> 00:12:41.514]  The media is trying to spin this to make it look like, oh, Trump made them come to him, and oh, Merkel tweeted this.
[00:12:41.514 --> 00:12:44.156]  This is the EU globalists.
[00:12:44.156 --> 00:12:47.058]  Their bureaucracy is unelected.
[00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:51.842]  Allied with the Vatican, allied with radical Islam, invading Europe as their open plan.
[00:12:51.842 --> 00:12:57.186]  Lined up against Japan, South Korea, leaders from Eastern Europe over here.
[00:12:58.183 --> 00:12:58.944]  And Trump.
[00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:03.666]  And Trump's there with his arms crossed saying, I don't care what you say.
[00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:04.967]  You invaded Ukraine.
[00:13:04.967 --> 00:13:07.128]  You overthrew Ukraine.
[00:13:07.128 --> 00:13:11.571]  And you made the Russians come into eastern Ukraine, an area that they've controlled for 500 years.
[00:13:11.571 --> 00:13:13.072]  That's where Russia was founded.
[00:13:13.072 --> 00:13:13.793]  That's your fault.
[00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:17.155]  Things wouldn't have happened like this if I would have been president.
[00:13:17.155 --> 00:13:22.478]  And it shows how these people were set up by the globalists in the United States after World War II with the Marshall Plan.
[00:13:23.183 --> 00:13:24.564]  They were totally under U.S.
[00:13:24.564 --> 00:13:28.327]  control, but then we had our power, our money, our infrastructure transferred to them.
[00:13:28.327 --> 00:13:30.808]  We've been paying for Europe for 65 years.
[00:13:30.808 --> 00:13:40.455]  They were set up as the socialist, globalist utopia, supposedly to be our example, paid for by the robber barons that had full control of their nations when we took control of it with the Marshall Plan.
[00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:43.337]  Of course, Soros has called for a Marshall Plan for Europe again.
[00:13:43.337 --> 00:13:51.903]  Trillions of dollars through him after he triggered the fall of the elected president of Ukraine, which he bragged about on Fareed Zakaria's program on CNN.
[00:13:53.464 --> 00:13:54.325]  So there it is.
[00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:57.607]  They're all basically on their knees to the king.
[00:13:57.607 --> 00:13:59.048]  And the media is calling him the king.
[00:13:59.048 --> 00:14:00.149]  Time Magazine is coming out.
[00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:02.570]  He's not a king in that he's not elected.
[00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:12.957]  He's a king in that he is the final breath, and maybe a new breath, a new lease on life for the West, if we accept it and take it, using the real power, the real influence the U.S.
[00:14:12.957 --> 00:14:16.820]  had before it was fully transferred to the Communist Chinese and destroyed.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.841]  So Trump is grabbing, with the Liberty Movement,
[00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.743]  Victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:14:21.743 --> 00:14:25.085]  And all of you that are against America, all of you that hate flyover country.
[00:14:25.085 --> 00:14:28.527]  Bill Maher last night saying he hopes America falls apart and goes bankrupt.
[00:14:28.527 --> 00:14:29.768]  He actually said that.
[00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.429]  Says he hopes the economy crashes.
[00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:32.670]  To stop this.
[00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:38.935]  Because these are all sympathizers and globalists hired and brought in and put in place to go along with the collaboration.
[00:14:38.935 --> 00:14:40.856]  You have to hate America to be part of this.
[00:14:40.856 --> 00:14:42.297]  Why should we sell out America?
[00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:43.518]  Why should we implode it?
[00:14:43.518 --> 00:14:45.279]  Why should we turn it over to the Communist Chinese?
[00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:46.600]  All because they work with the Rockefellers.
[00:14:48.793 --> 00:14:50.574]  In 1949, our government put him in power.
[00:14:50.574 --> 00:14:51.815]  That's all declassified.
[00:14:51.815 --> 00:14:53.195]  So here's some of the other articles.
[00:14:53.195 --> 00:14:55.316]  Here's Drudge Report.
[00:14:55.316 --> 00:15:00.138]  Soros, everything has gone wrong.
[00:15:00.138 --> 00:15:02.219]  He says he's living in his own bubble.
[00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:04.300]  That's right, you're living in your own bubble.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:15.945]  You thought you'd have a global corporate private government, he's a major Rothschild agent, and that you'd loot all these countries through oligarchs you controlled, and that you'd always be tax exempt, and you'd be above the law, and you'd have diplomatic immunity,
[00:15:16.505 --> 00:15:19.648]  And then your son would be on TV at Aleister Crowley Rituals.
[00:15:19.648 --> 00:15:22.270]  Half the Google images are him at Aleister Crowley Rituals.
[00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:34.619]  And you'd be involved in all this horrible crap, and funding cop killing, and funding racism, and you'd bully me, and sue me, and shut us all up, and you'd bully Hungary, and you'd bully Poland, and you'd bully everywhere, every election, from Italy to you name it.
[00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:35.860]  They're overthrowing you.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.681]  They're turning against you.
[00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:42.766]  You thought you'd march in 10 million Islamic age men the last six years, and then march in 20 million after that?
[00:15:43.366 --> 00:15:46.852]  And let them rape and kill and say it's okay and use political correctness?
[00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:49.736]  You may have some of the Stockholm Syndrome people going along with it.
[00:15:49.736 --> 00:15:52.100]  Alright, that's Alex Jones breaking it all down again.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.504]  Trump standing up for America to the globalists.
[00:15:54.504 --> 00:15:56.066]  You've seen the famous memes.
[00:15:56.066 --> 00:15:57.148]  It's glorious.
[00:15:57.148 --> 00:15:58.149]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:06.135]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have in Fort Worth's life, it'd take hours.
[00:16:06.135 --> 00:16:08.577]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:09.758]  It's stronger.
[00:16:09.758 --> 00:16:11.359]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:16:11.359 --> 00:16:14.582]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:15.703]  It's back in stock.
[00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:18.885]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:16:18.885 --> 00:16:22.208]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:22.868]  That's
[00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:43.373]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[00:16:43.373 --> 00:16:44.754]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:54.684]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:16:54.684 --> 00:16:57.747]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:17:02.031 --> 00:17:02.932]  I think so.
[00:17:18.047 --> 00:17:18.668]  I think so.
[00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:34.950]  I think so.
[00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:12.417]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:23.824]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.

[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.842]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:19:05.842 --> 00:19:06.423]  Thanks for holding.
[00:19:06.423 --> 00:19:07.483]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:19:07.483 --> 00:19:11.465]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[00:19:11.465 --> 00:19:20.190]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was
[00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:36.467]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[00:19:36.987 --> 00:19:45.576]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:50.481]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:56.087]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[00:20:03.463 --> 00:20:06.072]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:36.252 --> 00:20:41.076]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:50.343]  All right, and we're going back to Alex Jones, who's breaking down the latest from the G7 Summit.
[00:20:50.343 --> 00:20:53.946]  The humanity you thought was intimidated, we were asleep.
[00:20:53.946 --> 00:20:54.746]  Now we're awake.
[00:20:54.746 --> 00:20:59.049]  You pissing on our face and punching us in the nose doesn't intimidate us, it makes us angry.
[00:21:00.109 --> 00:21:02.950]  So that's on Drugs Report right there.
[00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:08.272]  Now, they always take our strongest points and try to make it look like it's weakness.
[00:21:08.272 --> 00:21:16.475]  But if you scroll down, they say here that one magnificent photo sums up Donald Trump's G7 visit.
[00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:19.196]  They try to spin it like this shows Trump is weak.
[00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:21.316]  No, in negotiation, they have no cards.
[00:21:21.316 --> 00:21:22.017]  They're bankrupt.
[00:21:22.017 --> 00:21:22.637]  They're a joke.
[00:21:22.637 --> 00:21:24.798]  We're in the best political position, the best economic position.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.422]  Unelected head of EU Juncker, the Nazi heir, said, I'll destroy Trump in one year.
[00:21:31.422 --> 00:21:36.625]  The communist Chinese president a year and a half ago went to Davos and said, I will defeat America with you.
[00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:38.326]  They all signed on.
[00:21:38.326 --> 00:21:40.007]  So this is the alignment of power.
[00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:48.531]  Communist China, with all of our industry and jobs moved there by globalist design, they all brag about the Chinese century is over for America for 50 years.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:22:00.205]  Okay, China, a billion, 800 million radical Islamists, the EU, unelected bureaucracy, Hollywood and the big banks.
[00:22:00.205 --> 00:22:04.647]  But none of that means anything when populations know you're authoritarian frauds.
[00:22:04.647 --> 00:22:07.208]  So there it all is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:07.208 --> 00:22:09.569]  And that's up on Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[00:22:09.569 --> 00:22:11.310]  Please retweet that image.
[00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.752]  This image tells everybody what they should know, understand what's happening to Soros.
[00:22:17.751 --> 00:22:22.453]  Understand that they understand that yes, we are the rise of anti-establishment.
[00:22:22.453 --> 00:22:25.294]  You know what's scaring them in Italy and Brazil?
[00:22:25.294 --> 00:22:35.418]  They have coalition governments forming of liberals and conservatives against Soros, against globalism, against foreign banks, against these foreign outside groups running our lives.
[00:22:35.418 --> 00:22:38.900]  It is simply over the top that this is happening.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:48.462]  People get, wait, foreign mega banks that don't pay taxes are telling me about women's issues and telling me about gay rights and while they bring in radical Muslims that throw us off buildings.
[00:22:48.462 --> 00:22:50.542]  Wait, wait, the economy's coming back.
[00:22:50.542 --> 00:22:51.783]  And how did Trump do this?
[00:22:51.783 --> 00:22:55.463]  Because there were artificial systems meant to make us poor to control us.
[00:22:55.463 --> 00:22:57.344]  Study feudalism.
[00:22:57.344 --> 00:22:58.124]  Search that term.
[00:22:58.124 --> 00:23:00.864]  Well, this is neo feudalism.
[00:23:00.864 --> 00:23:03.265]  This is neo feudalism.
[00:23:03.265 --> 00:23:07.606]  This is a new system in their own words of the ancient system.
[00:23:07.606 --> 00:23:08.486]  So Soros says,
[00:23:09.784 --> 00:23:16.109]  He recently admitted the rise of President Trump and the anti-establishment parties across the globe saying everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.
[00:23:16.109 --> 00:23:20.452]  Soros made the comment in an interview with the Washington Post.
[00:23:20.452 --> 00:23:24.915]  This is a guy that overthrew more than 15 countries, looted their treasuries.
[00:23:24.915 --> 00:23:26.436]  He was known as a total criminal to the 90s.
[00:23:26.436 --> 00:23:32.360]  And then he spent billions in PR about what a great, wonderful person he is.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.983]  Look, hey Trump, what magic wand?
[00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:41.197]  Do you have to get us past the 3% growth rate?
[00:23:41.197 --> 00:23:42.758]  High unemployment, gone.
[00:23:42.758 --> 00:23:43.878]  Record low unemployment.
[00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:45.979]  Bad trade deals, gone.
[00:23:45.979 --> 00:23:49.060]  Paris Climate Accord, total fraud, one-sided for the West, gone.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.020]  High taxes regulations, massively cut.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.461]  Obama's legacy, boom, boom.
[00:23:53.461 --> 00:23:57.222]  And for the next act, Hillary levitated into prison.
[00:23:57.222 --> 00:23:58.723]  Hillary for prison.
[00:23:58.723 --> 00:23:59.963]  Who launched that program?
[00:23:59.963 --> 00:24:01.023]  Yours truly.
[00:24:01.023 --> 00:24:02.564]  So, people ask, how are we doing this?
[00:24:04.255 --> 00:24:08.657]  It's a want for freedom and a renaissance.
[00:24:08.657 --> 00:24:14.380]  And it's in corporations, it's in private individuals, it's in churches, it's in families of every race, color, and creed.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.682]  It beats in the human breast, the desire.
[00:24:17.682 --> 00:24:18.563]  And it is in U.S.
[00:24:18.563 --> 00:24:24.706]  intelligence agencies and British intelligence agencies and foreign intelligence agencies, not at the top, but at every other level, that know the truth.
[00:24:26.172 --> 00:24:28.434]  The globalists thought they'd use the internet to control us and track us.
[00:24:28.434 --> 00:24:30.615]  And they got great power and made trillions off of it.
[00:24:30.615 --> 00:24:32.557]  But we woke up in the process.
[00:24:32.557 --> 00:24:39.262]  And humanity has bigger plans than the Rockefellers and all these people that are already dead and are in the ash pit of history.
[00:24:39.262 --> 00:24:47.348]  Their whole program thought we were such country bumpkins that we couldn't grasp big multinational systems ruling our lives from afar through different layers of bureaucracy.
[00:24:47.348 --> 00:24:52.212]  We had 1776 over a faraway king and fake courts ruling over us.
[00:24:52.212 --> 00:24:54.253]  America's instincts are against this.
[00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:58.376]  And that's all I am, is America's instinct coming back.
[00:24:58.376 --> 00:25:01.357]  And you look at that photo of Trump.
[00:25:01.357 --> 00:25:07.821]  He left, he was there a day and a half, he left just hours ago and he said, trade war with all of you that have one-sided deals.
[00:25:07.821 --> 00:25:09.802]  He said, you say we're putting in tariffs?
[00:25:09.802 --> 00:25:11.483]  Canada, you've got massive tariffs.
[00:25:11.483 --> 00:25:13.164]  Germany, you've got double the tariffs.
[00:25:13.164 --> 00:25:14.404]  France, you've got tariffs.
[00:25:14.404 --> 00:25:17.266]  You cut those tariffs by half, or we're gonna have a trade war.
[00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:18.546]  Oh my god, you can't do that!
[00:25:18.546 --> 00:25:19.467]  We have no tariffs!
[00:25:20.796 --> 00:25:21.697]  They have a tariff.
[00:25:21.697 --> 00:25:24.319]  If it's a $30,000 car we sell, it's $60,000.
[00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:27.101]  When it translates to Euros, same as the dollar.
[00:25:27.101 --> 00:25:28.782]  Euros a little bit below the dollar.
[00:25:28.782 --> 00:25:29.703]  I mean, it's double.
[00:25:29.703 --> 00:25:31.284]  We don't put any damn tariffs on it.
[00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:38.911]  Germany puts emission standards, the EU does, that we can't even follow and then they don't follow them themselves.
[00:25:38.911 --> 00:25:40.531]  It's all called a screw job.
[00:25:40.531 --> 00:25:44.092]  China's got dozens of ghost cities that millions of people could live in.
[00:25:44.092 --> 00:25:48.794]  They're just building giant highways and maglev rails everywhere off our money.
[00:25:48.794 --> 00:25:50.055]  Off the 900 billion.
[00:25:50.055 --> 00:25:55.896]  And Fareed Zakaria goes on, Bill Maher goes, Trump just hates Chinese people.
[00:25:55.896 --> 00:26:00.098]  No, he hates communists allied with our globalist controllers screwing us over.
[00:26:02.879 --> 00:26:10.684]  And that's all these guys have got, parlaying America in 1955 had half the world's wealth and was 4% of the world's population.
[00:26:10.684 --> 00:26:13.166]  96% had the other half.
[00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:14.907]  People go, oh my god, redistribute it!
[00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:21.432]  We could have distributed our ideas of capitalism to them, the better sections of it, and freed everything, and even lowered population.
[00:26:21.432 --> 00:26:24.434]  That's in the World Population Report the UN put out.
[00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:25.355]  In 49, they knew all this.
[00:26:26.291 --> 00:26:42.203]  But they decided on this path, to exploit the third world, balloon giant populations, then turn them as leftist ideology against the West, and in reverse colonization bring down the West, but have globalist corporations above the law separate from those corporations, and separate from those systems above the law.
[00:26:42.203 --> 00:26:49.869]  And Trump is destroying it all with precision, with the patriots backing him, and the original global plan of 1776 worldwide.
[00:26:52.268 --> 00:26:55.992]  But to lead that plan, America has to come back to dominance.
[00:26:55.992 --> 00:26:59.575]  We have to come back as an example of telling the truth, where people can trust us.
[00:26:59.575 --> 00:27:02.638]  Suddenly everybody wants to do deals with us again, because we're not treacherous.
[00:27:02.638 --> 00:27:08.544]  And then we could export our ideas and our technology and all the stuff we've suppressed, because the globalists have been holding back.
[00:27:08.544 --> 00:27:10.226]  They didn't give China one-tenth of what we got.
[00:27:10.226 --> 00:27:12.108]  I mean, America is the place.
[00:27:13.148 --> 00:27:15.349]  It's divine right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:15.349 --> 00:27:15.889]  It's real.
[00:27:15.889 --> 00:27:16.870]  It's Providence.
[00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.190]  It is Manifest Destiny.
[00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.711]  And InfoWars is part of that Manifest Destiny.
[00:27:20.711 --> 00:27:21.811]  That I would start InfoWars.
[00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:22.812]  That I would come out of Texas.
[00:27:22.812 --> 00:27:25.573]  That I would do all this without any people behind me or anything.
[00:27:25.573 --> 00:27:29.294]  But now, it's all synced up, like they say on Bill Maher.
[00:27:29.294 --> 00:27:31.775]  I'm synced up with Trump because they are freaked out.
[00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:33.935]  Because I can tell you what Trump's going to say before he says it.
[00:27:33.935 --> 00:27:37.637]  Because it's all part of a mission that's next level.
[00:27:37.637 --> 00:27:38.797]  We don't have to write it down.
[00:27:38.797 --> 00:27:39.477]  We don't have to do anything.
[00:27:39.477 --> 00:27:40.418]  It's already there.
[00:27:41.358 --> 00:27:46.042]  The Japanese and the Koreans, South Koreans, everybody else need to line up against Trump.
[00:27:46.042 --> 00:27:53.788]  And when all the globalists in the EU and the Communist Chinese came over in that photo, they've already drawn the battle lines.
[00:27:53.788 --> 00:27:54.869]  They already know the truth.
[00:27:54.869 --> 00:27:56.871]  Here it is.
[00:27:56.871 --> 00:27:59.253]  The battle lines are drawn, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:00.347 --> 00:28:11.174]  The battle lines are drawn with Eastern Europe, the Japanese, the South Koreans, everybody with Trump in the United States, with the unelected EU, and the Chinese.
[00:28:11.174 --> 00:28:13.515]  There's wider videos of Chinese communists.
[00:28:13.515 --> 00:28:16.077]  Anyways, it's all there.
[00:28:16.077 --> 00:28:20.359]  And the battle lines are drawn, ladies and gentlemen, and people are going to decide what side they're on.
[00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:21.980]  All we want is fairness.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.961]  All we want is free market.
[00:28:23.661 --> 00:28:28.707]  All we want is an open society and not to be overthrown by the guy that calls his group the open society because it's the opposite.
[00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:29.548]  Soros is a devil.
[00:28:29.548 --> 00:28:32.192]  Whatever he says, it's the opposite.
[00:28:32.192 --> 00:28:35.115]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's it for this live transmission.
[00:28:35.115 --> 00:28:36.036]  Trump is delivering.
[00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:37.078]  He's representing America.
[00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:45.147]  But by doing that, it's killing the big global parasite that set up this unequivocal... Okay, of course, that's not it for the live Sunday show here.
[00:28:45.147 --> 00:28:49.169]  That was Alex recording live earlier, breaking the G7 down.
[00:28:49.169 --> 00:28:55.253]  We'll be right back on the other side, where Alex breaks down the information that he's been receiving on Anthony Bourdain.
[00:28:55.253 --> 00:28:56.194]  You're not going to want to miss this.
[00:29:04.797 --> 00:29:05.918]  We're good to go.
[00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:31.011]  We're good to go.

[00:30:07.788 --> 00:30:08.249]  It's you!

[00:30:11.553 --> 00:30:20.258]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:30:20.258 --> 00:30:24.861]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:30:24.861 --> 00:30:26.302]  You are the info war.
[00:30:26.302 --> 00:30:29.844]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:30:30.524 --> 00:30:31.464]  We are the renaissance.
[00:30:31.464 --> 00:30:32.004]  And we are winning.

[00:32:03.368 --> 00:32:05.130]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:17.202]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:32:17.202 --> 00:32:22.208]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:32:22.848 --> 00:32:23.328]  Let's do it!
[00:32:40.037 --> 00:32:41.758]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:32:41.758 --> 00:32:51.761]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:54.401]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:32:54.401 --> 00:33:03.384]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:33:03.384 --> 00:33:06.045]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:36.888]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:36.888 --> 00:33:49.714]  Gentlemen, Alex Jones here, live, broadcasting from my hotel room with an emergency transmission update that is absolutely critical.
[00:33:49.714 --> 00:33:51.575]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:33:51.575 --> 00:33:53.616]  I got up because I'm here in Hawaii.
[00:33:54.352 --> 00:34:07.764]  At about 4 a.m., and I noticed that a Army source of mine had sent me a link that Anthony Bourdeaux had just died.
[00:34:07.764 --> 00:34:14.330]  And that they were saying it was a suicide out of the gates and that that was suspicious when they say something's a suicide when it's first announced.
[00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:18.654]  They always say police are looking into it, at least for a day or so, and then you hear suicide.
[00:34:18.654 --> 00:34:20.876]  Whenever you hear it right away, it's very suspicious.
[00:34:20.876 --> 00:34:22.157]  And the individual I was talking to
[00:34:23.647 --> 00:34:31.490]  Has been in the highest levels of security details, protecting Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush, you name it.
[00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:34.931]  And he thought it was very, very suspicious.
[00:34:34.931 --> 00:34:37.412]  Bourdain knew a lot of secrets.
[00:34:37.412 --> 00:34:44.274]  He had become very, very famous first writing, you know, a tell-all book about this, you know, the secrets of being a top chef.
[00:34:44.274 --> 00:34:48.736]  But I tweeted out that, hey, if I commit suicide, I didn't commit suicide, I was killed.
[00:34:49.605 --> 00:34:57.752]  I said he was enemies, you know, more and more with the Clintons, but I said he also said bad things about Trump, you know, that he'd serve him hemlock as a joke.
[00:34:57.752 --> 00:35:00.094]  But Bourdain was the only successful person on CNN.
[00:35:00.094 --> 00:35:05.239]  Bourdain was a superstar internationally and really respected.
[00:35:05.239 --> 00:35:08.181]  He was becoming really good friends with Elon Musk.
[00:35:08.181 --> 00:35:10.183]  Well, I got a
[00:35:11.486 --> 00:35:18.092]  Emergency phone call from one of the producers saying one of our best sources wants to talk to you.
[00:35:18.092 --> 00:35:19.053]  He's really upset.
[00:35:19.053 --> 00:35:19.774]  It all clicked.
[00:35:19.774 --> 00:35:28.582]  I went, oh my God, he told me off air months ago and on air just a few weeks ago that you look for other big Hollywood icon type people.
[00:35:28.582 --> 00:35:35.468]  He told me off air Anthony Bourdain saying that he had helped produce with Elon Musk.
[00:35:35.468 --> 00:35:37.530]  This individual works with SpaceX and other areas.
[00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:55.013]  This piece with Bourdain and that Bourdain had been challenged by Elon Musk to go public and to talk about his experiences and what he knew and to basically do a full Kanye, fully woke.
[00:35:55.013 --> 00:35:59.036]  And so I knew about this and then it totally clicked.
[00:35:59.036 --> 00:36:01.178]  This was about like six in the morning, Hawaii time.
[00:36:01.178 --> 00:36:02.759]  I had time to wake up.
[00:36:02.759 --> 00:36:04.100]  So I wrote a bunch of notes here.
[00:36:06.444 --> 00:36:08.145]  Hotel Coasters.
[00:36:08.145 --> 00:36:10.726]  And these are the notes that the gentleman basically laid out to me.
[00:36:10.726 --> 00:36:13.306]  And I know who this gentleman is.
[00:36:13.306 --> 00:36:18.428]  His family is well known and wealthy, to say the least.
[00:36:18.428 --> 00:36:24.410]  And he has been involved in Army Special Operations, Army Psychological Operations.
[00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:30.752]  And he's even said I can say who he is now, but at this point, I said, I'll give you some time to cool off before we do that.
[00:36:32.883 --> 00:36:42.589]  Right now, he told me this about an hour and a half ago right now, he's in hot water with folks, but we had to do this in case they tried to kill him.
[00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:46.011]  Or myself, because here's the bottom line.
[00:36:46.011 --> 00:36:49.233]  Ordain was 61 years old, he had a happy nine-year-old daughter.
[00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:51.434]  He had just gotten remarried, he'd never been happier.
[00:36:51.434 --> 00:36:55.896]  He had been friends with Elon Musk for a long time, he was becoming best friends with Musk.
[00:36:55.896 --> 00:36:58.338]  Musk is fully awake to globalism, the new world order.
[00:37:00.462 --> 00:37:01.463]  We're good to go.
[00:37:31.795 --> 00:37:48.998]  Musk and him had already been hanging out there in Morocco for four or five days, really discussing what was happening, what was going on up on this big vista where they had this high-tech science lab connected to some of the leaders of Morocco.
[00:37:48.998 --> 00:37:53.219]  And so they're up there doing the shoot.
[00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:57.860]  You'll remember a few months ago when one of our guests was from Morocco, that was all going on then in Morocco then.
[00:37:59.438 --> 00:38:10.203]  And they were discussing all these things and he was really deprogramming him and Anthony Bordeaux was kind of coming out of his shell, the Kanye West thing that started to happen.
[00:38:10.203 --> 00:38:19.907]  And then more of his shows became this whole woke thing globally to what was happening in a pro-human future and pro-space exploration, not a post-industrial world, not a
[00:38:20.934 --> 00:38:23.957]  Globalist depopulation planet.
[00:38:23.957 --> 00:38:30.464]  Not this thing where the AI gods take over that Musk and others have warned about that Google and others are embracing and saying humans are bad.
[00:38:30.464 --> 00:38:32.126]  We need to post human world.
[00:38:32.126 --> 00:38:37.351]  So Bourdain has been anti-Trump, anti-Hillary, anti-Weinstein.
[00:38:37.351 --> 00:38:43.958]  You know, he's really written things about Henry Kissinger that are true, that are very bold for somebody who's respected by liberals.
[00:38:45.391 --> 00:38:52.033]  And it's because he was seen as somebody, even more than Kanye West, who could double Trump's numbers with black voters.
[00:38:52.033 --> 00:38:59.094]  He was seen as somebody that would be the final domino to fall because he's so respected by liberals out there.
[00:38:59.094 --> 00:39:00.615]  He was showing signs of a conscience.
[00:39:00.615 --> 00:39:01.915]  He was realizing what was happening.
[00:39:01.915 --> 00:39:07.476]  He was aware of all the government sex trafficking and the things that were going on.
[00:39:07.476 --> 00:39:10.417]  And he was beginning to talk about working that into his show.
[00:39:14.892 --> 00:39:29.443]  We actually have the almost 12-minute video clip that is the episode in Morocco of the 12-minute sit-down in the 45-minute, hour-long episode, but 45 minutes is actual program, actual show.
[00:39:29.443 --> 00:39:31.645]  Our sources have the 11-minute 50-second clip.
[00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:43.330]  If they ever think that they're going to now grab it and make it all a retrospective about Bourdain and mix in his old episodes and change it, they got nothing coming.
[00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:48.375]  Because Bourdain had Final Cut, but his company didn't.
[00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:55.562]  And so just like Stanley Kubrick put out Eyes Wide Shut, when he had the Final Cut done, he had Final Cut power, but he refused to cut 24 minutes.
[00:39:55.562 --> 00:39:56.723]  He died instantly.
[00:39:58.143 --> 00:39:58.403]  Yeah.
[00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:17.151]  We're good to go.
[00:40:45.418 --> 00:40:45.798]  We're good to go.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:27.891]  Anthony Bourdeur was getting ready to go public and said that he was pro-human, bring the parties together, don't hate Trump, let's work together, let's have a human future, let's not be into eugenics.
[00:41:27.891 --> 00:41:32.175]  A Elon Musk message of truth, an Alex Jones message, because it's just the truth.
[00:41:32.175 --> 00:41:37.320]  Kanye West, in fact, he specifically talked about the bigger plan.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.362]  When I was at Louis Farrakhan's house two years ago, he goes,
[00:41:40.481 --> 00:41:46.905]  You know, Kanye comes by and he likes a bigger plan, and they looked at me because I hadn't been let in on the code word yet.
[00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:55.910]  And Farrakhan said, what you want about him is a major game-changer, T-person, just like Mordure could be, or, you know, any of these people.
[00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:05.443]  It's just absolutely mind-boggling right now to know this is going on, to know this is happening.
[00:42:05.443 --> 00:42:08.205]  I'm going to try to be calm and come back from break.
[00:42:08.205 --> 00:42:11.246]  Dr. Nick Maggis has got a whole huge presentation ready for you.
[00:42:11.246 --> 00:42:13.027]  His dad died in a mysterious plane crash.
[00:42:13.027 --> 00:42:13.927]  His brother, of course, a U.S.
[00:42:13.927 --> 00:42:14.948]  Senator.
[00:42:14.948 --> 00:42:17.409]  But he's got a lot of big inside intel for you.
[00:42:17.409 --> 00:42:22.311]  As you can see, I was planning to not go on air anywhere while I was on this trip with my kids for eight days.
[00:42:24.033 --> 00:42:28.515]  We don't have a future if I don't do this, so I will be here as much as I need to be.
[00:42:28.515 --> 00:42:34.999]  I'm very humbled to be in this position to have this type of information, but I have talked to the folks at SpaceX.
[00:42:34.999 --> 00:42:40.822]  I have talked to people inside Musk's organization right there at the top of it.
[00:42:40.822 --> 00:42:44.564]  And I am breaking down to you what is going on here.
[00:42:44.564 --> 00:42:47.586]  CNN will absolutely be in dreaded fear that we
[00:42:48.723 --> 00:42:51.926]  I mean, I was asked today, I said, should we release the 11-minute, 50-second clip?
[00:42:51.926 --> 00:42:54.608]  And I said, let's hold off while you're hot right now, while you're upset.
[00:42:54.608 --> 00:42:56.230]  I'm not gonna say who you are yet.
[00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:59.793]  They already know who you are.

[00:46:13.768 --> 00:46:18.472]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:46:18.472 --> 00:46:21.734]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.

[00:46:43.786 --> 00:46:45.387]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:18.371 --> 00:47:23.894]  The word is already, is that they're going to grab these episodes because there's this big awakening already happening.
[00:47:23.894 --> 00:47:29.297]  It hit a catalyst in Morocco a few months ago, and then now a chain reaction into this.
[00:47:29.297 --> 00:47:31.919]  It's all happening everywhere across the world.
[00:47:31.919 --> 00:47:43.586]  But as these prominent people begin to wake up and go with humanity and go with life and go with pro-human, there's an absolute panic by the globalists going on in there, trying to send a message by going after Bourdain.
[00:47:43.586 --> 00:47:45.807]  You can clearly see that, to threaten everybody else.
[00:47:46.505 --> 00:47:48.366]  We'll be right back on the other side of this break.
[00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:49.487]  This is an emergency.
[00:47:49.487 --> 00:47:52.369]  Global Transmission News Wars dot com.
[00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.450]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:57.493]  We will continue to go in through and beyond no matter what the cost may be.
[00:47:57.493 --> 00:48:00.295]  We'll go on to the end to quote Winston Churchill.
[00:48:00.295 --> 00:48:06.239]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Global Friday Transmission.
[00:48:11.084 --> 00:48:16.547]  Anthony Bourdain was one of the number one hosts in the world, the only success CNN had.
[00:48:16.547 --> 00:48:18.208]  He was branching out.
[00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:22.891]  He was planning to do programs on child trafficking, human sex trafficking.
[00:48:22.891 --> 00:48:25.052]  He'd become best friends with Elon Musk.
[00:48:25.052 --> 00:48:33.837]  He had spent close to a week in Morocco two months ago at a private home with a scientific research facility.
[00:48:33.837 --> 00:48:36.439]  And we have the 11 minute, 50 second clip.
[00:48:39.212 --> 00:48:40.373]  We're able to bring that to you.
[00:48:40.373 --> 00:48:44.657]  It's been offered to us, but we're not going to air that here at this point.
[00:48:44.657 --> 00:48:49.562]  If CNN or anybody says we're lying about this, we'll drop the hammer on you.
[00:48:49.562 --> 00:48:50.683]  I won't drop the hammer on you.
[00:48:50.683 --> 00:48:52.885]  Somebody's going to drop the hammer on you.
[00:48:52.885 --> 00:48:54.547]  They didn't want this clip to come out.
[00:48:54.547 --> 00:48:56.829]  They didn't want this information to come out.
[00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:58.811]  He was calling for a global awakening.
[00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:02.054]  He was understanding that Democrats are actually pro-war.
[00:49:02.054 --> 00:49:03.576]  They've been funding ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:49:04.927 --> 00:49:17.133]  He understood that the Republican establishment was just as bad as well, and that all these people claiming they were liberals weren't really liberals, and that Trump had a bigger plan, a new renaissance plan, and Elon Musk had convinced him of this.
[00:49:17.133 --> 00:49:24.697]  And so Bourdain was preparing, just like Kanye West and just like Kim Kardashian, to begin to reach out to Trump.
[00:49:24.697 --> 00:49:34.422]  It's like she came to the White House last week on getting black people out of prison who were given racist sentences because of what color they were.
[00:49:35.618 --> 00:49:42.961]  So that's the perfect way for her to reach out and show that Trump's good and have him move towards getting those laws changed, which he's now announced.
[00:49:42.961 --> 00:49:48.863]  The Clintons got it passed in 94, saying blacks were animals and needed to be made to heal like dogs.
[00:49:48.863 --> 00:49:49.783]  Remember that?
[00:49:49.783 --> 00:49:52.004]  Well, well, Trump thinks that's wrong.
[00:49:52.004 --> 00:49:59.466]  And so all this was about to happen and Bourdain was aware of what was happening and the Clintons were failing.
[00:49:59.466 --> 00:50:00.227]  They were falling.
[00:50:00.227 --> 00:50:02.307]  He was starting to come out and criticizing Hillary.
[00:50:02.307 --> 00:50:03.988]  He was starting to come out and criticize
[00:50:05.356 --> 00:50:11.799]  Others, like Weinstein, and he was about to become, not a conservative, not even a nationalist.
[00:50:11.799 --> 00:50:16.981]  He's a true international guy, but in a good sense, he really wants, he wanted peace and love.
[00:50:16.981 --> 00:50:18.162]  He's spoken out against Kissinger.
[00:50:18.162 --> 00:50:21.163]  He's spoken out against, you know, he said, I'll serve M. Locke to Trump.
[00:50:21.163 --> 00:50:31.707]  Back when he was buying into the bull, but he was getting ready via, via what was happening with Elon Musk to be a real leader and to go meet with Trump and to go public.
[00:50:31.707 --> 00:50:33.128]  That's really the big news here.
[00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:43.871]  And now he's died mysteriously in a hotel room, a crappy hotel room, right when he just got remarried, right when he has a nine-year-old daughter that's so happy, right when he told Elon Musk and others that he's the happiest he's ever been.
[00:50:43.871 --> 00:50:47.473]  This magically happens, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:47.473 --> 00:51:00.562]  The only guy, only guy, successful in their entire system, and everybody liked him because he had, you know, a little bit of humanity to him compared to somebody like Wolf Blitzer, somebody like Brian Stelter, somebody like Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:00.562 --> 00:51:01.083]  Now he's dead.
[00:51:02.006 --> 00:51:02.807]  Now he's dead.
[00:51:02.807 --> 00:51:08.151]  And they just say, boom, suicide, boom, move on.
[00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:09.392]  Boom, that's it.
[00:51:09.392 --> 00:51:11.974]  Just don't look at it, don't have a discussion, nothing to see here.
[00:51:11.974 --> 00:51:12.934]  That is ridiculous.
[00:51:12.934 --> 00:51:30.368]  And I have, from SpaceX sources, as I'm sitting there, getting ready to go have breakfast with my children, because I'm six hours ahead from the East Coast, five hours ahead from Central, three hours ahead from Pacific, four hours ahead from Mountain.
[00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:33.216]  It's 9.03 here where I'm at.
[00:51:33.216 --> 00:51:35.037]  9.04.
[00:51:35.037 --> 00:51:39.360]  And when I come back, I'm just going to read these notes to you I wrote.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:43.623]  I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 57 pages of notes.
[00:51:43.623 --> 00:51:46.044]  One of them's a coaster.
[00:51:46.044 --> 00:51:49.486]  And it says, uh, culture will speak from the dead.
[00:51:49.486 --> 00:51:51.728]  How dare they say it's open and shut?
[00:51:54.102 --> 00:51:59.265]  Also, they said it was critical to play the clip, but I never told you guys to do this, of Bourdain and Obama in Vietnam.
[00:51:59.265 --> 00:52:09.710]  When they first sat down and talked, how much Bourdain didn't like Obama, and some of the things he told Elon Musk, they knew that Bourdain knew things that he wasn't supposed to know.
[00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:13.912]  And they didn't even tell me everything.
[00:52:13.912 --> 00:52:15.133]  This is super dangerous.
[00:52:15.133 --> 00:52:17.234]  I'm risking my life even telling you this stuff.
[00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:20.436]  And that we have the clip.
[00:52:20.436 --> 00:52:21.736]  Go ahead and try me, CNN.
[00:52:21.736 --> 00:52:22.757]  We'll drop the hammer on you.
[00:52:26.833 --> 00:52:30.534]  The question is, will we let that happen?
[00:52:30.534 --> 00:52:36.695]  Dr. Nick Begich, a scientist, researcher, major native lands leader, his brother a former U.S.
[00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:43.536]  Senator, his father a famous congressman who did so much for the civil rights movement, Moore, who died very mysteriously, he's about to take over.
[00:52:43.536 --> 00:52:47.817]  I wanted to just let you know that I'm on vacation with family.
[00:52:47.817 --> 00:52:52.918]  I got a very desperate call from one of the producers at one of our top Pentagon SpaceX sources.
[00:52:56.821 --> 00:52:57.021]  Yeah.
[00:53:14.543 --> 00:53:17.065]  So I called our source back and he went over the whole thing.
[00:53:17.065 --> 00:53:17.625]  He was there.
[00:53:17.625 --> 00:53:19.927]  It was obviously they know who it is on the inside.
[00:53:19.927 --> 00:53:25.210]  It was at his home with his family and there in Morocco with their big facility.
[00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:29.493]  And of course when it comes out who he is, everybody knows who basically runs Morocco.
[00:53:29.493 --> 00:53:39.499]  And so you've got Elon Musk and you've got Anthony Bourdain at this big facility overlooking the Vista in the ocean.
[00:53:39.499 --> 00:53:43.222]  And they spent days out there and Musk is already really good friends with
[00:53:44.705 --> 00:53:47.325]  Or was good friends with Mr. Bourdain.
[00:53:47.325 --> 00:53:49.086]  And of course, Musk is telling you everything I tell you.
[00:53:49.086 --> 00:53:50.886]  World government, AI takeover.
[00:53:50.886 --> 00:53:52.526]  We gotta stop it.
[00:53:52.526 --> 00:53:54.007]  They plan to get rid of humans.
[00:53:54.007 --> 00:53:55.007]  The decision's been made.
[00:53:55.007 --> 00:53:57.187]  We gotta struggle against it.
[00:53:57.187 --> 00:53:58.187]  The media's lying to you.
[00:53:58.187 --> 00:53:58.827]  They're your enemies.
[00:53:58.827 --> 00:54:01.088]  They want to stop human progress.
[00:54:01.088 --> 00:54:04.829]  And so let me just read to you the notes that I was given.
[00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:06.729]  And again, I was already told this months ago.
[00:54:06.729 --> 00:54:09.729]  Also, Ashton Kutcher.
[00:54:09.729 --> 00:54:12.590]  He was about to go public in all of this.
[00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:13.090]  I was told
[00:54:14.059 --> 00:54:29.148]  A month before she went to the White House, about the same source, they call it, well they have several terms for it, but full spectrum reality.
[00:54:29.148 --> 00:54:30.469]  They have a lot of terms.
[00:54:30.469 --> 00:54:39.174]  Full spectrum drama, where Trump and others in the Patriot leadership recruited Kanye five years ago when they decided to make this move.
[00:54:40.225 --> 00:54:44.146]  The military was going to carry out a coup against Obama because he was signing stuff with the Chinese.
[00:54:44.146 --> 00:54:46.687]  They did the Office of Personnel Management hack.
[00:54:46.687 --> 00:54:49.848]  21 million names of all our spies, all our people, all their families.
[00:54:49.848 --> 00:54:50.668]  The keys of the kingdom.
[00:54:50.668 --> 00:54:54.289]  Apple's now moved there, giving them all the keys to all Apple users.
[00:54:54.289 --> 00:54:55.630]  Your cloud code.
[00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:56.230]  That's Reuters.
[00:54:57.435 --> 00:54:59.796]  I mean, we're already pretty much been taken over by the Chinese.
[00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:00.777]  They've got Hollywood.
[00:55:00.777 --> 00:55:02.558]  They're taking over the universities.
[00:55:02.558 --> 00:55:05.199]  I mean, it is mega level.
[00:55:05.199 --> 00:55:07.020]  The last-ditch effort was made with Trump.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.121]  He reached out to Kanye.
[00:55:08.121 --> 00:55:11.063]  He reached out to Kim Kardashian.
[00:55:11.063 --> 00:55:12.063]  She was on the fence.
[00:55:12.063 --> 00:55:12.924]  Kanye went with it.
[00:55:12.924 --> 00:55:16.546]  That's why they locked him up in a mental institution about a year and a half ago.
[00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:19.867]  He was going to already launch this, but they had let him go.
[00:55:19.867 --> 00:55:24.410]  They, you know, that whole act where they can say something's wrong with you and then grab you for a few days.
[00:55:26.147 --> 00:55:30.309]  And so, more importantly, a lot of stuff that Kanye was in there, but he powered through it.
[00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:31.450]  He's a great hero.
[00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:31.890]  He is, man.
[00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:32.790]  He's got everything to lose.
[00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:35.892]  He stood up because he has everything to gain.
[00:55:35.892 --> 00:55:39.493]  And so all of that unfolded.
[00:55:39.493 --> 00:55:49.138]  And so, you've got SpaceX, you've got Elon Musk that represents kind of the good faction at NASA that wants to have a pro-human future, doesn't want to suppress a lot of assistive technologies.
[00:55:49.138 --> 00:55:53.520]  I told you at the inauguration before Trump spoke that he would talk about unlocking the secrets of the universe.
[00:55:54.554 --> 00:55:58.996]  And that he would call for the secret medical technologies they've been suppressing to be released.
[00:55:58.996 --> 00:56:02.418]  He's not moving forward with that, I'm on record, because I have the sources.
[00:56:02.418 --> 00:56:04.279]  But I want to be honest with you.
[00:56:04.279 --> 00:56:05.480]  It's metaphysical.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.141]  I have sources, but we all know already.
[00:56:08.141 --> 00:56:10.522]  So we're already finishing each other's sentences.
[00:56:10.522 --> 00:56:11.283]  That's why they hate us.
[00:56:11.283 --> 00:56:18.807]  We are plugged in to the internet of the human mind, the human destiny, the human will, what humanity wants.
[00:56:19.637 --> 00:56:22.078]  And so, yes, we scientifically look at stuff.
[00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:23.598]  Yes, we talk to each other.
[00:56:23.598 --> 00:56:25.138]  Yes, but we're already synced up.
[00:56:25.138 --> 00:56:29.860]  Just like Bill Maher said last Friday, Alex Jones and Donald Trump are soulmates.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:30.360]  And it's true.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.360]  We're all soulmates.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:38.162]  There's billions of people that are soulmates with black skin, with white skin, with red skin, with yellow skin, with pink skin, with sunburned skin.
[00:56:39.378 --> 00:56:49.127]  We are all together in this big quest, in this love of humanity, the love of our ancestors, the love of the great quest, and there's people that want to satanically block that and steal the future, and it's not happening.
[00:56:49.127 --> 00:56:55.113]  So I'm going to go to Dr. Nick Begich after the break, or just a minute, but let me just give you these notes.
[00:56:55.113 --> 00:56:58.235]  Culture will speak from the dead.
[00:56:58.235 --> 00:56:59.917]  They've opened and shut, said that he died.
[00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:00.838]  It's preposterous.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.142]  I don't know.
[00:57:14.821 --> 00:57:20.024]  And things that he'd seen himself but didn't put together is what made him have nightmares and basically break down.
[00:57:20.024 --> 00:57:32.169]  He came out of the depression and wouldn't talk about what he was going to do except saying he liked what Kanye had done and was planning to go public and wanted to perhaps even meet with Trump publicly to say we should have unity and world peace.
[00:57:32.169 --> 00:57:40.233]  He liked the fact that Trump wants to work with Russia and the fact that he understood that Bourdain understood that was all made up.
[00:57:40.233 --> 00:57:43.575]  Bourdain didn't like the pressure he was put under by CNN to come

[00:59:52.867 --> 00:59:55.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:11.067]  The piggy bank that everybody's robbing and that ends.
[01:00:11.067 --> 01:00:21.512]  President Trump pulled no punches and dropped an economic suplex on the world leaders at the 44th annual G7 Summit in Quebec, Canada.
[01:00:21.512 --> 01:00:30.277]  The US, Canada, the UK, France, Italy, Japan and Germany represent more than 60% of global net worth between them.
[01:00:30.277 --> 01:00:34.399]  President Trump brought a long overdue wake-up call to the proceedings.
[01:00:34.659 --> 01:00:39.643]  We tackled a variety of issues and opportunities facing our nations.
[01:00:39.643 --> 01:00:42.585]  At the top of the list was the issue of trade.
[01:00:42.585 --> 01:00:49.509]  Very important subject because the United States has been taken advantage of for decades and decades and we can't do that anymore.
[01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:58.941]  We had extremely productive discussions on the need to have fair and reciprocal, meaning the same.
[01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:03.446]  People can't charge us 270% and we charge them nothing.
[01:01:03.446 --> 01:01:04.567]  That doesn't work anymore.
[01:01:06.028 --> 01:01:10.829]  I made a lot of statements having to do with clarity.
[01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:27.352]  We want and expect other nations to provide fair market access to American exports and that we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect American industry and workers from unfair foreign trading practices, of which really there are many.
[01:01:27.352 --> 01:01:29.793]  But we're getting them straightened out, slowly but surely.
[01:01:30.593 --> 01:01:39.740]  I think they are starting to be committed to a much more fair trade situation for the United States, because it has been treated very, very unfairly.
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.502]  And I don't blame other leaders for that.
[01:01:42.502 --> 01:01:45.004]  I blame our past leaders.
[01:01:45.004 --> 01:01:48.827]  There was no reason that this should have happened.
[01:01:48.827 --> 01:01:50.128]  No tariffs.
[01:01:50.128 --> 01:01:53.710]  In other words, let's say Canada, where we have
[01:01:54.975 --> 01:01:56.896]  Tremendous tariffs.
[01:01:56.896 --> 01:02:01.657]  The United States pays tremendous tariffs on dairy, as an example.
[01:02:01.657 --> 01:02:01.977]  270%.
[01:02:01.977 --> 01:02:05.798]  Nobody knows that.
[01:02:05.798 --> 01:02:06.479]  We pay nothing.
[01:02:06.479 --> 01:02:07.819]  We don't want to pay anything.
[01:02:07.819 --> 01:02:09.360]  Why should we pay?
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.341]  We have to, ultimately, that's what you want.
[01:02:12.341 --> 01:02:15.141]  You want a tariff-free.
[01:02:15.141 --> 01:02:17.142]  You want no barriers.
[01:02:17.142 --> 01:02:22.824]  And you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that's not fair.
[01:02:24.019 --> 01:02:27.041]  I mean, we have India where some of the tariffs are 100%.
[01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:27.061]  100%!
[01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:31.363]  And we charge nothing.
[01:02:31.363 --> 01:02:32.584]  You can't do that.
[01:02:32.584 --> 01:02:37.587]  And so we are talking to many countries, we're talking to all countries, and it's going to stop.
[01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:44.111]  And I don't blame these people, but I will blame them if they don't act smart and do what they have to do, because they have no choice.
[01:02:44.111 --> 01:02:46.832]  I'll be honest with you, they have no choice.
[01:02:46.832 --> 01:02:48.613]  They're either going to make the trades fair,
[01:02:49.795 --> 01:02:53.336]  Because our farmers have been hurt.
[01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:55.657]  You look at our farmers for 15 years.
[01:02:55.657 --> 01:02:58.878]  The graph is going just like this down.
[01:02:58.878 --> 01:03:00.599]  Our farmers have been hurt.
[01:03:00.599 --> 01:03:01.879]  Our workers have been hurt.
[01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:07.821]  Our companies have moved out and moved to Mexico and other countries, including Canada.
[01:03:07.821 --> 01:03:10.342]  Now, we are going to fix that situation.
[01:03:11.866 --> 01:03:15.049]  And if it's not fixed, we're not going to deal with these countries.
[01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:17.391]  But the relationship that I've had is great.
[01:03:17.391 --> 01:03:20.054]  So you can tell that to your fake friends at CNN.
[01:03:20.054 --> 01:03:31.425]  The relationship that I've had with the people, the leaders of these countries has been, I would really rate it on a scale of 0 to 10, I would rate it a 10.
[01:03:31.425 --> 01:03:36.329]  As an example, the European Union is brutal to the United States.
[01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:39.852]  They don't take, and they understand that, they know it.
[01:03:39.852 --> 01:03:42.253]  When I'm telling them, they're smiling at me.
[01:03:42.253 --> 01:03:44.495]  You know, it's like the gig is up.
[01:03:44.495 --> 01:03:45.735]  It's like the gig is up!
[01:03:45.735 --> 01:03:48.377]  They're not trying to, there's nothing they can say.
[01:03:48.377 --> 01:03:50.858]  They can't believe they got away with it.
[01:03:50.858 --> 01:03:53.740]  I asked the top person in China, how did it get so bad?
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.743]  He looked at me, he said, nobody ever talked to us.
[01:03:58.692 --> 01:04:04.562]  President Trump even called for the readmittance of Russia to the G7, thus making it the G8.
[01:04:04.562 --> 01:04:10.791]  Russia had been suspended from the group in 2014 due to the annexation of Crimea from the Ukraine.
[01:04:10.791 --> 01:04:12.594]  Members were against that idea.
[01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:19.277]  I would rather see Russia in the G8 as opposed to the G7.
[01:04:19.277 --> 01:04:24.182]  I would say that the G8 is a more meaningful group than the G7.
[01:04:24.182 --> 01:04:28.847]  President Trump then left the G7 for Singapore on a mission to negotiate peace.
[01:04:29.267 --> 01:04:31.569]  With Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
[01:04:31.569 --> 01:04:42.097]  Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has tasked Austria with the possibility of being the meeting place between President Trump and the Russian leader.
[01:04:42.097 --> 01:04:49.082]  As Chancellor Merkel's plea for a new world order sounds off the globalist panic and despair.
[01:04:49.082 --> 01:04:52.245]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:04:58.464 --> 01:05:02.429]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:05:02.429 --> 01:05:05.734]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:05:05.734 --> 01:05:12.002]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:05:12.002 --> 01:05:14.766]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:05:15.487 --> 01:05:19.312]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:05:19.312 --> 01:05:25.800]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.765]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:05:31.502 --> 01:05:35.425]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:05:35.425 --> 01:05:42.629]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:05:42.629 --> 01:05:47.853]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:05:47.853 --> 01:05:53.536]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:05:53.536 --> 01:05:57.519]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:05.063]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:05.063 --> 01:06:10.666]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:14.328]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:14.328 --> 01:06:17.510]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:19.251]  Some of the headlines today.
[01:06:19.251 --> 01:06:28.336]  It's going to be a big week ahead with Trump and Kim Jong-un meeting in Singapore.
[01:06:29.355 --> 01:06:31.115]  That's going to be huge.
[01:06:31.115 --> 01:06:36.596]  You've got Soros freaking out right now that Trump is actually winning.
[01:06:36.596 --> 01:06:42.437]  You have John Brennan saying that Trump is a temporary aberration.
[01:06:42.437 --> 01:06:47.978]  So yes, the people in control of the country is a temporary aberration, according to John Brennan.
[01:06:47.978 --> 01:06:54.340]  No, you and the scum like you are the temporary aberration, John Brennan.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:55.940]  So you've got all of that going on.
[01:06:57.534 --> 01:07:00.056]  You know, this is actually an interesting recipe here.
[01:07:00.056 --> 01:07:05.241]  The Democrats are saying in order to run for president in 2020, you have to be registered to the Democrat Party.
[01:07:05.241 --> 01:07:06.663]  So that strikes Bernie Sanders out.
[01:07:06.663 --> 01:07:13.730]  So if Bernie Sanders runs as an independent, Trump has the easiest path to victory in the history of presidential elections.
[01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:14.851]  But I'm already expecting that to happen.
[01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:21.083]  Folks, we are about to protest Bill Clinton, and it's all possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:30.485]  We've got specials running right now, store-wide, free shipping, 50% off top-selling items like Brain Force Plus, Survival Shield X2, Supermail Vitality, 50% off that, free shipping store-wide.
[01:07:30.485 --> 01:07:33.206]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:07:33.206 --> 01:07:37.288]  And we are about to protest Bill Clinton outside Bass Concert Hall at 6 p.m.
[01:07:37.288 --> 01:07:37.688]  Central.
[01:07:37.688 --> 01:07:41.589]  But first, here's a report from Alex Jones in response to Bill Maher.
[01:07:43.114 --> 01:07:48.638]  If you want to have a good future, if you want to have a shot at controlling your own destiny, you want to listen to me right now very carefully.
[01:07:48.638 --> 01:07:55.603]  Globalism is a form of modern serfdom in their own white papers, their own admissions, it's even in the WikiLeaks.
[01:07:55.603 --> 01:07:58.185]  But Bill Maher and others are now being honest.
[01:07:58.185 --> 01:08:01.947]  They're coming out and saying they want to crash the US economy.
[01:08:02.808 --> 01:08:07.611]  To defeat the operations that Donald Trump is running right now.
[01:08:07.611 --> 01:08:11.734]  This has been their policies before this is to implode our economy.
[01:08:11.734 --> 01:08:13.015]  They want us dependent.
[01:08:13.015 --> 01:08:19.039]  They don't want us to be upwardly mobile because they can't compete with a true capitalist open free market society.
[01:08:19.039 --> 01:08:23.241]  They want a crony capitalist society where the ultra elites decide the winners.
[01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:28.485]  That's why all the top billionaires, all the top guys that make like 12 billion a day like Jeff Bezos,
[01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:33.267]  Our anti-free market, anti-middle class, anti-family.
[01:08:33.267 --> 01:08:41.050]  Bloomberg came out and said somebody making $35,000 a year should pay more taxes when he escapes 99% of his taxes in offshore corporations.
[01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:41.890]  Look it up.
[01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:44.411]  So here is Bill Maher, the eugenicist.
[01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:45.932]  Bill Maher, the globalist.
[01:08:45.932 --> 01:08:49.373]  The man of the people saying he wants America to implode.
[01:08:50.686 --> 01:08:52.367]  Can I ask about the economy?
[01:08:52.367 --> 01:08:54.729]  Because this economy is going pretty well.
[01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:56.510]  We have to... What?
[01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:57.851]  Why is that funny?
[01:08:57.851 --> 01:08:59.311]  It is going well for now.
[01:08:59.311 --> 01:08:59.972]  For now, right.
[01:08:59.972 --> 01:09:00.632]  That's my question.
[01:09:00.632 --> 01:09:01.013]  Thank you.
[01:09:01.013 --> 01:09:03.694]  That's my question.
[01:09:03.694 --> 01:09:06.276]  I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.
[01:09:06.276 --> 01:09:08.097]  And by the way, I'm hoping for it.
[01:09:08.097 --> 01:09:11.639]  Because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy.
[01:09:11.639 --> 01:09:13.640]  So please, bring on the recession.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.961]  Sorry if that hurts people.
[01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:18.423]  But it's either root for a recession or you lose your democracy.
[01:09:19.504 --> 01:09:23.365]  I've told you thousands of times they want to, quote, crash the economy.
[01:09:23.365 --> 01:09:27.407]  And now they say it to your face as if that's a good thing for you.
[01:09:27.407 --> 01:09:36.710]  But then he elaborated in the same program, I'm about to show you some clips, explaining that, oh, this is the mismanagement of Trump that's done this and it's hurting America's power worldwide.
[01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:41.912]  No, that's the stolen power of America parlayed into the global corporations that are tax-exempt.
[01:09:41.912 --> 01:09:43.933]  And that power is coming to an end.
[01:09:43.933 --> 01:09:44.353]  Come with me.
[01:09:45.629 --> 01:09:52.912]  What I did not predict was that the United States would sort of abdicate leadership of its position.
[01:09:52.912 --> 01:10:02.317]  Because I argued the United States would still be incredibly powerful, it would set the agenda, it represented the values, it had a way of being able to be the leader.
[01:10:02.317 --> 01:10:04.838]  And this shift where the United States has decided
[01:10:04.858 --> 01:10:05.278]  Yeah.
[01:10:05.278 --> 01:10:05.458]  Yeah.
[01:10:23.456 --> 01:10:24.097]  O.C.
[01:10:24.097 --> 01:10:30.866]  Farid and the CFR and the media told us the American century was over, it was the communist Chinese century.
[01:10:30.866 --> 01:10:32.668]  They told us it was over.
[01:10:32.668 --> 01:10:37.073]  But see, now it's not over, so they spin that as if it's a bad thing for America.
[01:10:37.073 --> 01:10:39.236]  Here's the truth, and they admit it in their own economic papers.
[01:10:40.197 --> 01:10:43.558]  Building first world economies pulls up the third world.
[01:10:43.558 --> 01:10:46.720]  Lowering first world economies does not pull up the third world.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.340]  That's the line of globalism.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:59.425]  And so having one-sided trade deals, destroying the US as a long-term trading partner to India and China and Mexico and 160 other countries, actually then degrades the whole global economy.
[01:10:59.425 --> 01:11:00.706]  And that's what the globalists admit.
[01:11:00.706 --> 01:11:09.189]  They want a post-industrial, austere world with poor people worldwide, with a tiny elite, tax-exempt, with diplomatic immunity, who broke
[01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:10.030]  We're good to go.
[01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:45.659]  And when somebody like Muammar Gaddafi comes along and helps Africa and builds it up, and works with the West for eight years, they set him up and killing.
[01:11:45.659 --> 01:11:51.646]  But all these so-called liberals sit there and act like they care about you when they're really political monsters.
[01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:02.550]  I'm less surprised that a Trump could rise.
[01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:10.916]  I mean, that's happened in countries as how quickly the Republican Party just completely got behind him.
[01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:13.858]  It reminds me of the Neanderthals, you know.
[01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:15.939]  No.
[01:12:15.939 --> 01:12:17.120]  No, really.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.661]  I love ancient archaeology and that kind of stuff.
[01:12:19.661 --> 01:12:28.023]  So, like, you have the humans and the Neanderthals who are sharing a planet from about 100,000 BC to about 40,000 BC.
[01:12:28.023 --> 01:12:30.704]  And then suddenly, no more Neanderthals.
[01:12:30.704 --> 01:12:35.746]  I think because humans, they figured out the blowgun.
[01:12:35.746 --> 01:12:37.686]  So, they could kill you from 10 feet away.
[01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.387]  I'm getting this from the movie Quest for Fire.
[01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:43.455]  But I think that.
[01:12:43.455 --> 01:12:47.898]  So, but like, it's like, there's Neanderthals, and then suddenly, the fossil's gone.
[01:12:47.898 --> 01:12:50.299]  And that's kind of what happened to the Republicans.
[01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:53.101]  They were just there, and then they suddenly disappeared.
[01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:56.723]  What you just saw is another incredible example of total spin.
[01:12:56.723 --> 01:13:01.365]  It's like last week when Bill Maher said, the FBI wasn't spying on you, Trump.
[01:13:01.365 --> 01:13:04.327]  They were watching you because you're a Russian traitor.
[01:13:04.327 --> 01:13:09.310]  Well, this week, he says, oh, just like Neanderthal got extincted by Cro-Magnon,
[01:13:11.089 --> 01:13:12.710]  The Republican Party is now extinct.
[01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:18.313]  It's actually exploding and growing everywhere as the populist, nationalist movement takes it over.
[01:13:18.313 --> 01:13:22.095]  As is happening all over the world as humanity awakens to you guys.
[01:13:22.095 --> 01:13:26.717]  And so we're now aware of your globalist game plan, so you are in check, mate.
[01:13:26.717 --> 01:13:27.518]  That's what's happening.
[01:13:27.518 --> 01:13:28.338]  It's globalism.
[01:13:28.338 --> 01:13:30.780]  It's the Democratic Party and it's coastal elitism.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:40.567]  That people are fleeing in record numbers from New York, New Jersey, California, you name it, to get away from your draconian out-of-control policies.
[01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:46.111]  It is your systems of collectivism, controlled by crony capitalists, that is coming to an end.
[01:13:46.111 --> 01:13:53.697]  The Republican Party is having new life breathed into it because the blue-blood scum that also want to keep Americans poor is being removed.
[01:13:53.697 --> 01:13:54.737]  America's return
[01:13:55.498 --> 01:14:00.240]  We'll lead the world into a new boom, just like we did during the 1950s.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:07.364]  America's demise will lead America and the world into a new dark age, ladies and gentlemen, and we're not going to put up with it.
[01:14:07.364 --> 01:14:08.325]  We're on the march.
[01:14:08.325 --> 01:14:09.685]  The globalists are on the run.
[01:14:09.685 --> 01:14:11.406]  Soros is getting kicked out of Europe.
[01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:13.928]  Every country's voting to throw out the globalists.
[01:14:13.928 --> 01:14:20.151]  We're winning, and scum like Bill Maher hope that you're stupid and hope that they can prey on you and manipulate you.
[01:14:20.151 --> 01:14:22.112]  Those of you that buy into his propaganda,
[01:14:22.772 --> 01:14:24.733]  Are being conned, whether you like it or not.
[01:14:24.733 --> 01:14:31.236]  And it's time to get past the cognitive dissonance and admit that Trump was able to defeat the globalists and all their propaganda.
[01:14:31.236 --> 01:14:37.740]  Trump's been able to turn the economy around in a year and a half because he knows what he's doing and he's advised by very, very smart people.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.602]  So your claims that things are getting so much better by accident flies in the face of reality.
[01:14:42.602 --> 01:14:48.185]  We are economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually kicking your ass, globalists.
[01:14:48.185 --> 01:14:49.366]  Humanity is now awake.
[01:14:50.267 --> 01:14:53.837]  Sleeping Giant is now in your face and is no longer sleeping.
[01:14:53.837 --> 01:14:56.164]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com

[01:15:35.196 --> 01:15:39.520]  You better believe you got one!
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.604]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.

[01:16:57.396 --> 01:16:58.621]  We can't extend this.
[01:17:03.908 --> 01:17:04.729]  We're good to go.
[01:17:28.005 --> 01:17:28.906]  We're good to go.
[01:17:58.248 --> 01:18:01.832]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:18:01.832 --> 01:18:03.614]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:18:03.614 --> 01:18:14.885]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:18:15.666 --> 01:18:24.828]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:24.828 --> 01:18:35.371]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:35.891 --> 01:18:38.512]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:18:38.512 --> 01:18:40.233]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:40.233 --> 01:18:50.238]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:18:50.238 --> 01:18:52.879]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:18:52.879 --> 01:18:57.581]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:18:58.857 --> 01:19:03.439]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:04.000]  Thanks for calling.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.440]  Hey Alex, mate.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:09.042]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[01:19:09.042 --> 01:19:22.189]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was pretty cool, and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests.
[01:19:22.329 --> 01:19:26.071]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[01:19:26.071 --> 01:19:32.953]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body.
[01:19:32.953 --> 01:19:33.814]  It's all amazing.
[01:19:33.814 --> 01:19:34.594]  Thank you, brother.
[01:19:34.594 --> 01:19:43.178]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:48.060]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.901]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[01:19:51.121 --> 01:19:54.186]  You, the crew, and the listeners out there.
[01:19:54.186 --> 01:20:01.937]  1776 Worldwide.
[01:20:01.937 --> 01:20:04.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.502 --> 01:20:26.565]  You know how it seems bad, and it's chaotic, and the enemy's going crazy?
[01:20:26.565 --> 01:20:31.048]  Well, when you step with your heel on the head of a snake, what happens?
[01:20:31.048 --> 01:20:36.392]  The rest of that snake's body rides around, wraps around your leg, goes crazy, causing chaos.
[01:20:36.392 --> 01:20:37.273]  Death throes.
[01:20:37.273 --> 01:20:38.874]  But it's death throes.
[01:20:38.874 --> 01:20:39.814]  That's really the key.
[01:20:39.814 --> 01:20:43.377]  It's death throes, because your heel is still on that snake's head.
[01:20:43.377 --> 01:20:45.198]  Doesn't matter what the rest of its body's doing.
[01:20:45.198 --> 01:20:47.620]  Its head is pinned, and it's over for that snake.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.461]  That's what we're seeing the Illuminati doing.
[01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:51.522]  That's amazing.
[01:20:51.522 --> 01:20:57.627]  They are writhing around in pain and they're going crazy and you see all this chaos because they're in their death throes.
[01:20:57.627 --> 01:21:00.168]  We're literally witnessing the Illuminati's death throes.
[01:21:00.168 --> 01:21:05.953]  It's grab your popcorn time, sit back, relax, pray to God and enjoy the show.
[01:21:11.823 --> 01:21:13.585]  We're here with John Abiskaran.
[01:21:13.585 --> 01:21:16.188]  He's a Coptic Christian.
[01:21:16.188 --> 01:21:32.926]  And he was breaking down the prophecies of Mark Taylor, who in 2011 was documented in 2012 in major Christian magazines predicting that Donald J. Trump would become the 45th President of the United States and that it would signal a major global revival.
[01:21:33.646 --> 01:21:40.089]  I've talked to so many great pastors that I really respect, like Rodney Howard Brown and others, and they've talked about this fact.
[01:21:40.089 --> 01:21:49.294]  And now that you see Trump delivering on the mass arrest of pedophiles worldwide, delivering on the return of our Republic, standing up for Christian rights, it is unprecedented.
[01:21:49.294 --> 01:21:53.456]  You have the Pope, who's not a real Catholic, but a Jesuit globalist, openly calling for the end of Christianity.
[01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:54.577]  I don't know.
[01:22:22.218 --> 01:22:32.541]  We're witnessing prophecy right now, and what an amazing time this is, and I hope he'll repeat the things he said the last few hours to me, but he's got the floor right now to lay this out to you.
[01:22:32.541 --> 01:22:33.602]  Please take over, my friend.
[01:22:33.602 --> 01:22:34.402]  God bless you.
[01:22:34.402 --> 01:22:35.002]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:22:35.002 --> 01:22:35.642]  Appreciate you.
[01:22:35.642 --> 01:22:37.103]  Thank you very much.
[01:22:37.103 --> 01:22:38.323]  Great to be here.
[01:22:39.183 --> 01:22:46.386]  Um, so basically what I was talking with Alex about before is really the heart of the matter of what's really going on here.
[01:22:46.386 --> 01:22:48.967]  Why the whole establishment is against Donald Trump.
[01:22:48.967 --> 01:22:51.608]  It's not because they don't like him and they don't like his personality.
[01:22:51.608 --> 01:22:52.548]  They got a beef with him.
[01:22:52.548 --> 01:22:53.449]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:53.449 --> 01:22:57.210]  Because they understand what's really going on with Donald Trump.
[01:22:57.210 --> 01:23:04.052]  You see, Donald Trump, according to this prophecy that came out back in 2011, look it up, Mark Taylor, just look up Trump prophecies.
[01:23:04.052 --> 01:23:06.914]  It's going to open up a whole world to what's really going on here.
[01:23:06.914 --> 01:23:07.474]  So basically,
[01:23:08.314 --> 01:23:16.460]  Imagine if I came to you, Alex, and told you, hey, in 2024, whatever, the next election in a few years, Eddie Murphy's going to run and win and be president.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:17.220]  That's out of left field.
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.521]  You'd be like, what are you talking about?
[01:23:18.521 --> 01:23:21.283]  It's the same thing as if somebody said Donald Trump's going to win.
[01:23:21.283 --> 01:23:25.086]  And the purpose of it is, and if you look up the prophecy, you'll see what it was.
[01:23:25.086 --> 01:23:29.629]  You see, the New World Order, the Illuminati, they've been wanting to make a one world government.
[01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:31.511]  The problem is that there's a big boy in the way.
[01:23:31.511 --> 01:23:34.333]  It's called America and our Constitution, which is protecting us.
[01:23:35.013 --> 01:23:47.036]  So, what you saw for the last several years and several presidencies is that they've all been on the same page, the agenda, to bring America down to its knees to the level of the rest of the world in order for them to implement a one-world government.
[01:23:47.036 --> 01:23:49.197]  You can't deal with a big boy in the neighborhood like America.
[01:23:49.197 --> 01:23:50.117]  It's in the way.
[01:23:50.117 --> 01:23:51.057]  The West, too.
[01:23:51.057 --> 01:23:52.237]  The West has to fall.
[01:23:52.237 --> 01:23:54.458]  America has to fall for them to make a one-world government.
[01:23:54.958 --> 01:23:59.042]  Now, you know that God's a nationalist and Satan is a globalist?
[01:23:59.042 --> 01:24:00.664]  And I could prove it to you right now.
[01:24:00.664 --> 01:24:02.126]  It's the Tower of Babel story.
[01:24:02.126 --> 01:24:04.928]  That was the first one world government in the ancient world.
[01:24:04.928 --> 01:24:09.093]  And they wanted to build a tower to reach the throne of God and dethrone God.
[01:24:09.093 --> 01:24:11.395]  Idiots, whatever, nimrods, fine.
[01:24:11.395 --> 01:24:14.859]  But the point is, this first one world government, what did God do to stop it?
[01:24:15.539 --> 01:24:20.163]  He smote them with the different languages, instantly creating the different nations of the world.
[01:24:20.163 --> 01:24:22.205]  He wants us separated into different nations.
[01:24:22.205 --> 01:24:26.789]  He's basically saying, look, we're going to have a one world government in heaven, in my kingdom.
[01:24:26.789 --> 01:24:30.913]  But while you're on earth and Satan's running around, I want you separated into nations.
[01:24:30.913 --> 01:24:34.836]  Because when you get together with a one world government, you become arrogant and do stupid stuff.
[01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:38.159]  That's what happened in the ancient world with the Tower of Babel under Nimrod.
[01:24:38.459 --> 01:24:40.680]  And that's what's happening, what they're trying to do now.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.101]  The New World Order, the Illuminati, whatever you want to call it.
[01:24:43.101 --> 01:24:49.604]  They are Luciferians, straight up, and they want to make a one world government in order for the Antichrist to take his seat.
[01:24:49.604 --> 01:24:51.925]  See, they know the Bible better than you and me.
[01:24:51.925 --> 01:24:55.946]  And they're trying to make things happen in order for the Antichrist to take his seat.
[01:24:55.946 --> 01:24:56.367]  However, God...
[01:24:57.327 --> 01:24:58.788]  Has made his move.
[01:24:58.788 --> 01:25:01.710]  And what that is, is he brought in this guy out of left field.
[01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:04.712]  The last person we would have ever expected to be president.
[01:25:04.712 --> 01:25:05.653]  Donald Trump.
[01:25:05.653 --> 01:25:08.715]  And he prepared Donald Trump his entire life for this job.
[01:25:08.715 --> 01:25:10.697]  The job of dismantling the Illuminati.
[01:25:10.697 --> 01:25:11.197]  Think about it.
[01:25:11.197 --> 01:25:13.018]  Look at all that's been happening.
[01:25:13.018 --> 01:25:19.523]  No man could go through what this man went through and is going through now with the entire world, the entire establishment against him like this.
[01:25:19.523 --> 01:25:23.226]  And with all the money and power and elitism trying to stop him.
[01:25:23.226 --> 01:25:24.627]  This man should have been dead a long time ago.
[01:25:24.867 --> 01:25:26.488]  And he certainly shouldn't be president.
[01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:29.649]  The fact that he's president alone, we witnessed a miracle.
[01:25:29.649 --> 01:25:33.030]  That's all it had to be a miracle for him to win.
[01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:35.711]  I mean, they were cheating in the elections.
[01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:36.671]  Everything was against him.
[01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:39.352]  The entire media and everything, and somehow he still wins?
[01:25:39.352 --> 01:25:41.873]  That alone is a hint that it was an act of God.
[01:25:41.873 --> 01:25:44.054]  Hillary's own campaign said they couldn't believe it.
[01:25:44.654 --> 01:25:46.976]  Nobody could believe it.
[01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:49.098]  As you're speaking right now, a rainbow has just appeared.
[01:25:49.098 --> 01:25:52.721]  You said an act of God, and in the last few seconds, the rainbow appeared behind you.
[01:25:52.721 --> 01:25:53.701]  That's pretty cool.
[01:25:53.701 --> 01:25:54.322]  That's pretty cool.
[01:25:54.322 --> 01:25:57.825]  Because God's around, he's doing everything, and he's in the trenches right now.
[01:25:57.825 --> 01:26:00.187]  In fact, when you understand what's really going on, it's a lot of fun.
[01:26:00.187 --> 01:26:05.591]  Because you get to watch God dismantle the Illuminati before your eyes.
[01:26:05.591 --> 01:26:08.153]  And he's using Donald Trump like a blunt force object.
[01:26:08.153 --> 01:26:11.336]  Donald Trump is basically an agent for God.
[01:26:11.536 --> 01:26:15.639]  It's not that it's Donald Trump doing everything, it's God doing everything, using Donald Trump.
[01:26:15.639 --> 01:26:16.419]  Even Newt Gingrich.
[01:26:16.419 --> 01:26:17.940]  I don't know if you guys saw this interview.
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:23.843]  During the election, they asked Newt Gingrich, how come both sides are against Donald Trump, including the Republicans?
[01:26:23.843 --> 01:26:27.386]  I mean, aren't the Republicans risking Hillary winning by going against him like this?
[01:26:27.386 --> 01:26:34.190]  And in a moment where God seemed to have zapped Newt Gingrich to tell the truth, he did.
[01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:34.930]  You know what he said?
[01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:35.911]  Look at his words.
[01:26:35.911 --> 01:26:38.292]  He said, well, that's because Donald Trump was never initiated.
[01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:39.313]  He was never part of the club.
[01:26:40.374 --> 01:26:43.176]  He was never part of the secret society.
[01:26:43.176 --> 01:26:45.338]  He was never part of the Illuminati.
[01:26:45.338 --> 01:26:50.382]  But then Newt Gingrich said, however, he knows everything that goes on in the club.
[01:26:50.382 --> 01:26:53.425]  And that's why everybody that's in the club is afraid.
[01:26:53.425 --> 01:27:02.072]  You see, the reason why they're against him isn't because they hate him, they don't like his personality, the fact that they call him orange or whatever, all this stuff, that's nothing.
[01:27:02.072 --> 01:27:02.812]  That's why.
[01:27:03.573 --> 01:27:04.534]  That's why.
[01:27:04.534 --> 01:27:06.135]  This is a spiritual thing.
[01:27:06.135 --> 01:27:09.157]  Even the demons that these people are possessed with, they can't stand it.
[01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:11.319]  They understand exactly what's going on.
[01:27:11.319 --> 01:27:16.063]  That Donald Trump was sent and anointed by God to dismantle the Illuminati.
[01:27:16.063 --> 01:27:17.244]  Now you might ask yourself, why?
[01:27:17.244 --> 01:27:19.706]  Because a lot of people think that America is under judgment.
[01:27:19.706 --> 01:27:20.847]  And that it deserves judgment.
[01:27:20.847 --> 01:27:21.827]  This is key.
[01:27:21.827 --> 01:27:23.109]  This is not the case at all.
[01:27:23.789 --> 01:27:28.870]  You see, we have an example in the Bible of Sodom and Gomorrah, which received judgment and was destroyed.
[01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:34.632]  But there's another city or nation in the Bible that we should concern ourselves or think about.
[01:27:34.632 --> 01:27:35.112]  Nineveh!
[01:27:35.112 --> 01:27:36.972]  Remember the story of Jonah and the whale?
[01:27:36.972 --> 01:27:41.153]  And Jonah went and told the people of Nineveh, and they actually repented?
[01:27:41.153 --> 01:27:44.214]  America is Nineveh, not Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:27:44.674 --> 01:27:46.296]  And America is anointed by God.
[01:27:46.296 --> 01:27:46.816]  Think about it.
[01:27:46.816 --> 01:27:50.599]  It was created in the last, in the recent times of our timeline.
[01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:51.880]  It just showed up in the neighborhood.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.442]  I mean, it's only 200 years old.
[01:27:53.442 --> 01:27:55.884]  It's like God preserved it for the end.
[01:27:55.884 --> 01:28:02.670]  And it's used, and it's the only country in the history of existence created in the name of the Judeo-Christian Bible.
[01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:14.718]  The forefathers, our forefathers of this great country, they mention in their memoirs, look it up, that when they were writing the Constitution, they had an open Bible there, and they got every idea for the Constitution straight out of the Bible.
[01:28:14.718 --> 01:28:15.879]  Inalienable rights, what's that?
[01:28:15.879 --> 01:28:17.400]  It was a radical idea at the time.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.183]  Inalienable rights means that your rights are given to you directly from God, and only God can take away those rights.
[01:28:22.183 --> 01:28:27.086]  Before that, your rights were given to you by the government or the king, but no, not in America.
[01:28:27.086 --> 01:28:29.448]  In America, your rights are given to you by God.
[01:28:29.448 --> 01:28:32.250]  Whether you believe in God or not, that's the case.
[01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:32.590]  However,
[01:28:34.472 --> 01:28:35.693]  The enemy's been attacking.
[01:28:35.693 --> 01:28:42.560]  You see, there's people in this world that are jealous of America, that hate America, that don't want America to be America.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.301]  But they could never come at us headstrong.
[01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:47.865]  We have the greatest, most powerful military in the world, the greatest economy in the world.
[01:28:47.865 --> 01:28:52.670]  They could never come at us in conventional terms and attack us head-on in a battle or in a war.
[01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:53.371]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:57.495 --> 01:29:03.762]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[01:30:05.836 --> 01:30:06.297]  It's you!

[01:30:09.574 --> 01:30:18.280]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:22.883]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.

[01:30:28.547 --> 01:30:30.308]  We are the renaissance, and we are winning!
[01:30:58.078 --> 01:31:08.689]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:10.751]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.

[01:31:18.459 --> 01:31:18.880]  Absolutely.
[01:31:38.803 --> 01:31:50.506]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:31:50.506 --> 01:31:53.807]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.

[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.062]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:20.065]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:33:20.065 --> 01:33:24.852]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:26.829 --> 01:33:28.589]  But they could never come at us headstrong.
[01:33:28.589 --> 01:33:32.130]  We have the greatest, most powerful military in the world, the greatest economy in the world.
[01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:36.952]  They could never come at us in conventional terms and attack us head-on in a battle or in a war.
[01:33:36.952 --> 01:33:38.132]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:33:38.132 --> 01:33:41.073]  They had to do the alternative, the Trojan horse style.
[01:33:41.073 --> 01:33:45.294]  They have been doing a multi-generational plan to bring down America.
[01:33:45.294 --> 01:33:55.357]  And they've come in through our country, rising their way up through the ranks and getting themselves in position of leadership in every single facet of our society in order to bring down
[01:33:56.457 --> 01:33:57.358]  America.
[01:33:57.358 --> 01:33:58.579]  And that's what they've been trying to do.
[01:33:58.579 --> 01:34:03.323]  And suddenly, we're witnessing a 180 degree turn with Donald Trump.
[01:34:03.323 --> 01:34:05.264]  In fact, they're taking several blows.
[01:34:05.264 --> 01:34:07.706]  Brexit was a blow to the New World Order.
[01:34:07.706 --> 01:34:10.068]  The rise of Trump was a blow to the New World Order.
[01:34:10.068 --> 01:34:11.950]  And now other countries are going to get out of the Brexit.
[01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:14.131]  I get out of the European Union.
[01:34:14.131 --> 01:34:15.771]  The euro is falling as we speak.
[01:34:15.771 --> 01:34:16.712]  It's falling as we speak.
[01:34:16.712 --> 01:34:17.432]  Now in the prophecies.
[01:34:17.432 --> 01:34:19.753]  She's put 80 plus million in to prop it up.
[01:34:19.753 --> 01:34:20.653]  It's failing.
[01:34:20.653 --> 01:34:20.993]  That's right.
[01:34:20.993 --> 01:34:22.994]  Nothing they do now works anymore.
[01:34:22.994 --> 01:34:25.275]  Because God decided to, I guess, take action.
[01:34:25.275 --> 01:34:27.416]  He gave him so long, but now the tide's turned.
[01:34:27.416 --> 01:34:29.297]  Yes, the tide is turning.
[01:34:29.297 --> 01:34:29.837]  As a matter of fact,
[01:34:30.017 --> 01:34:36.363]  You're going to see, according to the prophecies, the dollar become stronger than it's ever been in its entire history.
[01:34:36.363 --> 01:34:43.269]  It's going to be America, it's going to be the number one most greatest powerful country, the pillar of the world, the light of the world, once again.
[01:34:43.269 --> 01:34:49.034]  And I think it's because it's the one country in the history of existence created in the name of Christianity.
[01:34:49.034 --> 01:34:50.996]  Keep talking about it brother, you're on fire.
[01:34:52.938 --> 01:34:54.619]  Yeah, it's a beautiful rainbow.
[01:34:54.619 --> 01:34:55.499]  This place is beautiful.
[01:34:55.499 --> 01:34:57.060]  Hawaii is beautiful.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:04.042]  Now the thing is, when you look at what Trump has been doing, let's think about what Trump's been doing since he took office.
[01:35:04.042 --> 01:35:08.004]  He's been laser focused on one agenda and one agenda only.
[01:35:08.644 --> 01:35:11.825]  Make America great again by destroying the Illuminati.
[01:35:11.825 --> 01:35:13.205]  And that's what he's been doing.
[01:35:13.205 --> 01:35:13.965]  Think about it.
[01:35:13.965 --> 01:35:14.525]  TPP.
[01:35:14.525 --> 01:35:15.785]  Getting us out of TPP.
[01:35:15.785 --> 01:35:18.986]  That was totally hurting the Illuminati because they're globalists.
[01:35:18.986 --> 01:35:20.666]  They're trying to set up a globalist system.
[01:35:20.666 --> 01:35:22.927]  The whole thing with the Paris climate thing.
[01:35:22.927 --> 01:35:23.607]  All of it.
[01:35:23.607 --> 01:35:32.988]  He's getting us out of that stuff and basically unfurling, undoing everything the Illuminati has been able to do to us in all these several decades in the past.
[01:35:32.988 --> 01:35:34.649]  And it's driving them crazy.
[01:35:34.649 --> 01:35:36.349]  It's driving them crazy and you could see it.
[01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:39.530]  And then you see Donald Trump being protected.
[01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:40.410]  This is an anointing.
[01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:43.251]  This is an actual holy protection that's put on him.
[01:35:43.251 --> 01:35:44.932]  Because any man would have been dead a long time ago.
[01:35:44.932 --> 01:35:45.732]  I'm saying this now.
[01:35:45.732 --> 01:35:49.573]  I remember hearing about the gentleman, let's talk about him in a moment, years ago.
[01:35:49.573 --> 01:35:52.454]  And I never really clicked until the day he got in my face a nice way.
[01:35:52.454 --> 01:35:54.215]  Your daughter and my daughter were together in the pool.
[01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:55.435]  He said, listen, why are we talking about it again?
[01:35:55.435 --> 01:35:56.836]  I'm like, I've known about it.
[01:35:56.836 --> 01:35:57.216]  I have it.
[01:35:57.216 --> 01:35:58.036]  Then I went and looked it up.
[01:35:58.036 --> 01:36:01.618]  And I looked up on the Wayback Machine, 2011, he did say this.
[01:36:01.618 --> 01:36:02.258]  Let's start with,
[01:36:03.138 --> 01:36:07.680]  We're kind of here at the middle, but let's start with what we're talking about, about the guy that was the prophet for this.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:07.960]  Sure.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.781]  Mark Taylor is a fireman, good old American, regular guy.
[01:36:10.781 --> 01:36:17.543]  He was a fireman for several years, I think 20 years in Orlando, Florida, and he's close to God.
[01:36:17.543 --> 01:36:18.443]  God picked this guy.
[01:36:18.723 --> 01:36:20.984]  Simple guy, regular guy, nothing special.
[01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:28.049]  He picked this guy to communicate to the rest of us of what his plans are to dismantle the Illuminati.
[01:36:28.049 --> 01:36:33.592]  And so, Mark Taylor's been getting visions and receiving word from God about what's gonna happen.
[01:36:33.592 --> 01:36:40.257]  Now, look, when we normally hear this about people getting visions from God and receiving word from God, you gotta always, you know, think twice.
[01:36:40.257 --> 01:36:42.618]  Well, okay, is it really or is it not?
[01:36:42.618 --> 01:36:43.779]  The thing is about Mark Taylor,
[01:36:44.119 --> 01:36:50.003]  Literally, everything he has said, which came from God, in detail, has come to fruition.
[01:36:50.003 --> 01:36:50.883]  It's unbelievable.
[01:36:50.883 --> 01:36:59.049]  When you go back and look at those prophecies and read them and see them or hear them, you're going to be shocked at how every step has been coming true and it's going to continue to come true.
[01:36:59.329 --> 01:37:09.752]  According to the prophecy, America is going to be awesome and it's going to be used as the launching pad, as the home base for the final harvest, because God goes out as a winner.
[01:37:09.752 --> 01:37:12.133]  As like a surge, like remember in the war, the surge?
[01:37:12.133 --> 01:37:15.074]  This is the final harvest before the end times.
[01:37:15.074 --> 01:37:20.535]  And he's pushed the end times, giving us more time, giving us a reprieve in order to get together, pray.
[01:37:20.535 --> 01:37:21.516]  That's what we got to do.
[01:37:21.516 --> 01:37:21.996]  We got to pray.
[01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:23.857]  Even if you don't pray, start praying.
[01:37:23.857 --> 01:37:27.919]  Because that's the real ammunition that brings down the enemy.
[01:37:27.919 --> 01:37:29.280]  We're in a real war here.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:29.960]  That's what life is.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.941]  People ask, what's life?
[01:37:30.941 --> 01:37:31.801]  Life is a war.
[01:37:31.801 --> 01:37:32.322]  It's a war.
[01:37:32.322 --> 01:37:33.642]  It is good versus evil.
[01:37:33.642 --> 01:37:34.783]  It is a dualistic world.
[01:37:34.783 --> 01:37:35.964]  Look at Hollywood, the whole media.
[01:37:35.964 --> 01:37:38.405]  They hate Christians.
[01:37:38.405 --> 01:37:39.386]  Look at Hollywood, the whole media.
[01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:40.786]  They literally hate Christians.
[01:37:40.786 --> 01:37:44.128]  They admit that the persecution of Christians doubled the last 10 years.
[01:37:44.128 --> 01:37:47.070]  They absolutely admit that if they can extend
[01:37:48.609 --> 01:37:49.009]  That'd be God.
[01:38:04.468 --> 01:38:06.109]  Wouldn't care about Christianity.
[01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:08.791]  They just look at it as just another religion I don't believe in, whatever.
[01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:12.414]  Why is there a vitriolic hatred towards Christianity?
[01:38:12.414 --> 01:38:13.575]  Think about that.
[01:38:13.575 --> 01:38:15.076]  Because it's a spiritual war.
[01:38:15.076 --> 01:38:16.217]  It's a bloodlust.
[01:38:16.217 --> 01:38:19.039]  Because it's a spiritual thing that we're talking about here, people.
[01:38:19.039 --> 01:38:25.844]  Not necessarily the people may not even realize, but if there's a demon inside them, or if they're not with God, or walking in the world, in the worldly evil world,
[01:38:27.205 --> 01:38:31.246]  They're naturally going to reject what's from God.
[01:38:31.246 --> 01:38:33.047]  That's why you see people rejecting Donald Trump.
[01:38:33.047 --> 01:38:41.150]  But however, the good news is there's millions and millions of the silent majority that understand what's going on and they're supporting Donald Trump.
[01:38:41.150 --> 01:38:42.070]  That's why he won.
[01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.931]  How did he win?
[01:38:42.931 --> 01:38:43.471]  Think about it.
[01:38:43.471 --> 01:38:44.591]  How did Donald Trump win?
[01:38:44.591 --> 01:38:45.752]  And I love the spirit of it.
[01:38:45.752 --> 01:38:46.752]  They know he's not perfect.
[01:38:46.752 --> 01:38:47.492]  He's a wrecking ball.
[01:38:47.492 --> 01:38:48.753]  He never was a hypocrite.
[01:38:48.753 --> 01:38:49.633]  They instinctively
[01:38:49.653 --> 01:38:54.015]  From the beginning, understood that it was a weapon against the enemy.
[01:38:54.015 --> 01:38:57.197]  Like you said, the way he just doesn't even care what they do to him.
[01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:57.917]  They don't.
[01:38:57.917 --> 01:39:07.482]  In fact, in the prophecy, God said, they will speak against him, they will throw all the darts at him, they will do everything they can, but it will roll off his back like the water rolling off of a duck.
[01:39:07.482 --> 01:39:11.364]  Just like the feathers protect the duck, he's protecting Donald Trump.
[01:39:11.964 --> 01:39:14.747]  You know, Alex, I wanted to mention something to you really quick.
[01:39:14.747 --> 01:39:18.952]  The day of, you see, numbers, symbolism, it's a big deal to the Luciferians.
[01:39:18.952 --> 01:39:23.077]  That's why you see symbolism everywhere in our movies and corporate logos and everything.
[01:39:23.077 --> 01:39:23.878]  Do you know why?
[01:39:23.878 --> 01:39:26.321]  This is how the language to break the veil.
[01:39:26.841 --> 01:39:27.962]  To go to the other side of the veil.
[01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:30.084]  They do rituals that open up portals.
[01:39:30.084 --> 01:39:31.145]  Demons come in.
[01:39:31.145 --> 01:39:32.886]  They get their powers from those demons.
[01:39:32.886 --> 01:39:34.007]  That's how it works.
[01:39:34.007 --> 01:39:39.611]  That's how... That's why God had a real beef in the Old Testament against doing any kind of divination, sorcery.
[01:39:39.611 --> 01:39:40.992]  Not because he doesn't like it.
[01:39:40.992 --> 01:39:43.554]  Because it has a real effect in this world.
[01:39:43.554 --> 01:39:47.478]  It's what breaks the veil between this world and the real world on the other side.
[01:39:48.438 --> 01:39:49.138]  It's dangerous.
[01:39:49.138 --> 01:39:49.759]  It's very dangerous.
[01:39:49.759 --> 01:39:51.099]  Never touch a Ouija board.
[01:39:51.099 --> 01:39:52.000]  Remember that.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.140]  Now, numbers is a big deal too.
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:56.962]  Now, you know that number 6666 is an evil number.
[01:39:56.962 --> 01:40:00.783]  However, number 7 is a holy number, a very holy number.
[01:40:00.783 --> 01:40:12.988]  And the day of the inauguration for Donald Trump, the day he put his hand on our Bible and swore in to become our 45th president, on that day, Donald Trump was 70 years, 7 months, and 7 days old on that day.
[01:40:13.148 --> 01:40:13.488]  That's right.
[01:40:13.488 --> 01:40:15.971]  Now, you understand what's going on with Pedigree and all of that stuff?
[01:40:15.971 --> 01:40:17.753]  You see, the enemy's been doing a lot of bad stuff.
[01:40:17.753 --> 01:40:19.214]  They've been kidnapping children.
[01:40:33.728 --> 01:40:36.811]  An average of 800,000 children get kidnapped in America every year.
[01:40:36.811 --> 01:40:40.914]  And they make a big deal out of a handful of them spread out throughout the year, Amber Alert and all that.
[01:40:40.914 --> 01:40:45.538]  So that we subconsciously think, oh, when a kid gets kidnapped, they make a big deal about it and we hear about it.
[01:40:45.538 --> 01:40:48.401]  And they don't mention all the others and all the rest.
[01:40:48.401 --> 01:40:51.664]  You know what Donald Trump's been doing since the day he got president?
[01:40:51.664 --> 01:40:54.166]  He's been going after the pedophiles.
[01:40:54.166 --> 01:40:55.927]  They've been doing raids after raids.
[01:40:55.927 --> 01:40:57.288]  Of course, the media doesn't mention this.
[01:40:57.288 --> 01:40:58.389]  You've got to look at it.
[01:40:58.389 --> 01:40:59.510]  Look into it.
[01:40:59.510 --> 01:41:00.751]  Seek ye the truth.
[01:41:00.751 --> 01:41:01.612]  That's an order from God.
[01:41:01.952 --> 01:41:05.373]  Seek ye the truth, because when you go after the truth, you end up to God.
[01:41:05.373 --> 01:41:06.394]  That's no matter what.
[01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:08.775]  You go after the truth, you end up with God.
[01:41:08.775 --> 01:41:10.215]  And look it up!
[01:41:10.215 --> 01:41:21.460]  Donald Trump's been sending raids, capturing and finding children in cages waiting to be tortured and ritually sacrificed.
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:26.742]  He's been saving people, he's been saving children, and he's been arresting pedophiles like crazy, raid after raid.
[01:41:27.182 --> 01:41:27.723]  That's the thing.
[01:41:27.723 --> 01:41:28.945]  It shows up in local news.
[01:41:28.945 --> 01:41:29.886]  We cover the news every day.
[01:41:29.886 --> 01:41:30.567]  It's everywhere.
[01:41:30.567 --> 01:41:32.710]  It's like every day, but never national news.
[01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:42.545]  And then they panic more and more and they have Nambla now coming out at the UN, coming out on Vice, coming out of the Huffington Post, coming out on Salon saying,
[01:41:42.745 --> 01:41:43.666]  Absolutely.
[01:41:43.666 --> 01:41:43.906]  Go ahead.
[01:42:00.897 --> 01:42:03.258]  What we've been seeing is... There's a bigger plan.
[01:42:03.258 --> 01:42:04.599]  Yeah, there is a bigger plan.
[01:42:04.599 --> 01:42:09.661]  Basically, first of all, North Korea, watch what's going to happen.
[01:42:09.661 --> 01:42:10.881]  That regime's going to fall.
[01:42:10.881 --> 01:42:12.942]  The people of North Korea are going to be freed.
[01:42:12.942 --> 01:42:14.383]  There isn't going to be World War III.
[01:42:14.383 --> 01:42:16.164]  There isn't going to be World War III from North Korea.
[01:42:16.164 --> 01:42:17.104]  It's not going to happen.
[01:42:17.104 --> 01:42:19.865]  What's going to happen is that the North Korean regime will fall.
[01:42:19.865 --> 01:42:23.147]  They're going to merge into one country and just be a normal country, Korea.
[01:42:23.147 --> 01:42:23.807]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:42:24.607 --> 01:42:26.709]  Uh, Donald Trump's going after Iran now.
[01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:27.250]  That's next.
[01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:28.811]  That's the next big threat to the world.
[01:42:28.811 --> 01:42:35.877]  He's going after them, and that regime that's controlling Iran is gonna fall, because believe me, the people of Iran, they need to, they want to be freed.
[01:42:35.877 --> 01:42:40.681]  They tried to do a revolution when it happened in Egypt, and the Egyptians kicked out the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:42:40.681 --> 01:42:43.703]  They saw that, and the people of Iran said, let's do it too!
[01:42:43.703 --> 01:42:44.244]  They tried.
[01:42:44.244 --> 01:42:45.165]  What did Obama do?
[01:42:45.165 --> 01:42:47.407]  He snuffed it, stopped it, and basically
[01:42:48.027 --> 01:42:49.568]  Didn't allow it to happen.
[01:42:49.568 --> 01:42:52.410]  But now that Trump's president, the Iranians understand that.
[01:42:52.410 --> 01:42:54.072]  And they're thinking, hey, this is our chance.
[01:42:54.072 --> 01:42:57.614]  Because Trump's going to help us, and he will.
[01:42:57.614 --> 01:42:59.956]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[01:44:58.063 --> 01:45:01.665]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:45:01.665 --> 01:45:03.446]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:03.446 --> 01:45:14.713]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:15.473 --> 01:45:24.680]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:30.624]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:35.727]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:35.727 --> 01:45:38.349]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:45:38.349 --> 01:45:40.070]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:44.874]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[01:45:45.094 --> 01:45:50.037]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:50.037 --> 01:45:52.698]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:52.698 --> 01:45:57.401]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[01:47:01.406 --> 01:47:04.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.043 --> 01:47:29.867]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:29.867 --> 01:47:33.408]  Stopped it and basically didn't allow it to happen.
[01:47:33.408 --> 01:47:39.030]  But now that Trump's president, the Iranians understand that and they're thinking, hey, this is our chance because Trump's going to help us.
[01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.791]  And he will.
[01:47:39.791 --> 01:47:44.092]  He'll help the people bring down that evil regime so that we can have peace in the Middle East.
[01:47:44.092 --> 01:47:45.213]  And it's going to happen.
[01:47:45.213 --> 01:47:46.133]  It's going to happen.
[01:47:46.133 --> 01:47:47.574]  What you're going to witness is
[01:47:48.314 --> 01:47:51.895]  The media, one day, will start talking good about Trump.
[01:47:51.895 --> 01:47:53.315]  I know that sounds crazy.
[01:47:53.315 --> 01:47:59.497]  I know that it's probably better odds for the moon to crash into the earth before that happens, but it's gonna happen.
[01:47:59.497 --> 01:48:05.878]  Because Donald Trump is doing such an incredible job running this country, that truth will come out no matter what.
[01:48:05.878 --> 01:48:09.659]  They even said last week, like, oh my god, everything's turned around, but oh, it's not him, though.
[01:48:09.659 --> 01:48:12.020]  Oh yeah, they're trying to say that, but everybody understands.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:12.980]  Everybody, there's only...
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.641]  One out of ten people believe them at this point.
[01:48:16.641 --> 01:48:19.802]  Most people don't believe the media anymore because they're waking up.
[01:48:19.802 --> 01:48:22.523]  Everyday people are taking the red pill and waking up.
[01:48:22.523 --> 01:48:35.948]  And let's be clear, I'd love to give Trump all the credit, and I do, a lot of it, for everybody, but Scott, exactly, and the globalists have been suppressing us by design in their own admissions because, as you said, America is not the most evil country in the world.
[01:48:35.948 --> 01:48:40.329]  It's been given providence, it's just been invaded and taken over because they were threatened by it.
[01:48:40.329 --> 01:48:41.149]  Explain that to people.
[01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.950]  Okay, when you look at
[01:48:43.686 --> 01:48:44.967]  The spiritual thing, okay?
[01:48:44.967 --> 01:48:46.888]  Well, first of all, God's work in the world.
[01:48:46.888 --> 01:48:52.091]  Did you know that 90% of all helping the poor in the world comes from America?
[01:48:52.091 --> 01:48:55.292]  90% of evangelical work in spreading the Word of God comes from America.
[01:48:55.292 --> 01:48:56.833]  And we're only 5% of the world's population.
[01:48:56.833 --> 01:48:58.634]  We're only 5% of the population.
[01:48:58.634 --> 01:49:04.977]  90% of the orphanages that are owned and run and operated in the world are owned and run and operated by Americans.
[01:49:04.977 --> 01:49:08.059]  90% of God's work in this world comes from America.
[01:49:08.059 --> 01:49:09.760]  And people think that America's under judgment?
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:10.981]  No, no, no.
[01:49:10.981 --> 01:49:12.622]  The people aren't under judgment.
[01:49:12.622 --> 01:49:14.604]  The corrupt government is under judgment.
[01:49:14.604 --> 01:49:21.990]  The people that are the elites that are controlling this country and trying to bring it down, they're under judgment, but not the people and not America.
[01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:24.231]  America, the opposite is going to happen.
[01:49:24.231 --> 01:49:26.934]  It's going to be blessed.
[01:49:26.934 --> 01:49:28.034]  Great points, my friend.
[01:49:28.034 --> 01:49:29.576]  There have been a lot of the great points to me.
[01:49:29.576 --> 01:49:31.377]  Anything you would like to finish out?
[01:49:31.377 --> 01:49:32.338]  Let me think for a second.
[01:49:32.338 --> 01:49:34.360]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:34.520]  Okay.
[01:49:35.401 --> 01:49:36.301]  Are you ready?
[01:49:36.301 --> 01:49:37.762]  Alright.
[01:49:37.762 --> 01:49:45.185]  The most important thing to remember here is this is a spiritual battle that's manifesting itself into the physical, and we're seeing it everywhere.
[01:49:45.185 --> 01:49:51.767]  The most important thing is to understand, we need to support Trump, not because he's Trump, because God put him there.
[01:49:51.767 --> 01:49:53.568]  So we're supporting God by supporting Trump.
[01:49:54.028 --> 01:49:55.088]  We gotta pray.
[01:49:55.088 --> 01:50:00.050]  That's the real ammunition we have against the enemy, and that's really what the enemy really fears.
[01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:05.132]  People getting on their knees, opening their hearts to God, to the Lord, and praying.
[01:50:05.132 --> 01:50:13.055]  And praying for them, for God to help us, to help America, help the world, and get rid of the Illuminati, and to help and protect Donald Trump and his family.
[01:50:13.055 --> 01:50:14.855]  And it's happening, but we have to continue.
[01:50:14.855 --> 01:50:16.816]  The moment we let up on that, it's over.
[01:50:19.496 --> 01:50:20.476]  Beautiful rainbow.
[01:50:20.476 --> 01:50:21.757]  Look at that.
[01:50:21.757 --> 01:50:23.719]  And that's a symbol of the future.
[01:50:23.719 --> 01:50:25.100]  That's a symbol of the future.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:26.100]  The symbol for America.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:33.046]  We're coming in for a great number of years of prosperity, of blessings, but we have to be the true lights of the world.
[01:50:33.046 --> 01:50:34.867]  And we have to use it as an example.
[01:50:34.867 --> 01:50:43.713]  And the spiritual revival that's happening in America and will continue to happen, we're going to start seeing it manifested throughout the world, thanks to Jesus Christ, because he knows what he's doing.
[01:50:43.713 --> 01:50:48.297]  And right now, the real reason, you've got to remember, why the enemy is so upset with Donald Trump?
[01:50:48.737 --> 01:50:50.359]  It's not because they're upset with him.
[01:50:50.359 --> 01:50:51.561]  They're upset with God.
[01:50:51.561 --> 01:50:52.843]  And they know what's going on.
[01:50:52.843 --> 01:50:57.389]  That their days are numbered, they're in a corner, and it's over for them.
[01:50:57.389 --> 01:50:58.150]  Great points, John.
[01:50:58.150 --> 01:50:59.532]  Hey, let's make one more point, alright?
[01:50:59.532 --> 01:50:59.712]  Alright.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:01.961]  I know this.
[01:51:01.961 --> 01:51:07.704]  They have been fundamentally scared of him since the beginning and I'm not some perfect person but I love God.
[01:51:07.704 --> 01:51:28.916]  The way they've been enraged by me and the way they want to intimidate Trump supporters because Trump just gives us a chance to realize there could be a better future not under these people and the fact that they know their whole system is coming down and that all of it is being exposed is really an amazing moment for humanity right now and it just really is
[01:51:28.916 --> 01:51:32.758]  That's great, because I mean, we've been here, and everybody feels like, oh, you're in Hawaii, it's all liberal.
[01:51:32.758 --> 01:51:34.940]  Man, I've probably met 300 people the last day I've been here.
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:35.900]  People are on fire.
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:36.961]  They're awake.
[01:51:36.961 --> 01:51:39.543]  You guys want to come on air with us?
[01:51:39.543 --> 01:51:40.824]  God bless.
[01:51:40.824 --> 01:51:44.466]  I mean, it's just an amazing time right now to be alive.
[01:51:44.466 --> 01:51:52.391]  And again, it doesn't mean things are perfect, but it means humanity is coming out of a time of being under the spell of evil.
[01:51:52.811 --> 01:51:54.291]  Can I add one real quick?
[01:51:54.291 --> 01:51:59.352]  You know how it seems bad, and it's chaotic, and the enemy's going crazy?
[01:51:59.352 --> 01:52:03.833]  Well, when you step with your heel on the head of a snake, what happens?
[01:52:03.833 --> 01:52:09.334]  The rest of that snake's body rides around, wraps around your leg, goes crazy, causing chaos.
[01:52:09.334 --> 01:52:10.054]  Death throes.
[01:52:10.054 --> 01:52:11.675]  But it's death throes.
[01:52:11.675 --> 01:52:12.615]  That's really the key.
[01:52:12.615 --> 01:52:16.176]  It's death throes, because your heel is still on that snake's head.
[01:52:16.176 --> 01:52:17.976]  Doesn't matter what the rest of its body's doing.
[01:52:17.976 --> 01:52:20.417]  Its head is pinned, and it's over for that snake.
[01:52:20.417 --> 01:52:22.237]  That's what we're seeing the Illuminati doing.
[01:52:22.557 --> 01:52:24.319]  That's amazing.
[01:52:24.319 --> 01:52:30.424]  They are riding around in pain and they're going crazy and you see all this chaos because they're in their death throes.
[01:52:30.424 --> 01:52:32.966]  We're literally witnessing the Illuminati's death throes.
[01:52:32.966 --> 01:52:38.752]  It's grab your popcorn time, sit back, relax, pray to God, and enjoy the show.
[01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:41.993]  And then I've used the example of everything they say is the opposite.
[01:52:41.993 --> 01:52:43.133]  They call themselves Illuminati.
[01:52:43.133 --> 01:52:44.894]  God illuminates and brings life to the world.
[01:52:44.894 --> 01:52:46.674]  They claim that they're bringing light.
[01:52:46.674 --> 01:52:52.396]  Well, what is that quandary in the Bible where Christ is the morning star, but also Lucifer is the morning star?
[01:52:52.396 --> 01:52:53.596]  I mean, is that something he composes?
[01:52:53.596 --> 01:53:02.578]  What happens is that the Luciferians take literally everything that's of God and put it on Satan and give him the title or the credit or whatever.
[01:53:02.578 --> 01:53:04.259]  For instance, the one eye.
[01:53:04.259 --> 01:53:05.979]  We all know about the one eye.
[01:53:05.979 --> 01:53:07.660]  Originally, that was the one eye of God.
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:12.583]  And then the Luciferians took that to make it to mean, for them, the one eye of Lucifer.
[01:53:12.583 --> 01:53:13.323]  The pyramid.
[01:53:13.323 --> 01:53:15.385]  The pyramid in the ancient world, look this up.
[01:53:15.385 --> 01:53:20.508]  It's, you know that verse that talks about how Jesus is the cornerstone and the capstone at the same time?
[01:53:20.508 --> 01:53:23.410]  The only shape that could do that is the pyramid.
[01:53:23.410 --> 01:53:27.153]  Originally, in the ancient world, the pyramid represented God, the creator of the world.
[01:53:27.153 --> 01:53:30.715]  And then here's Satan taking that symbolism and using it for himself.
[01:53:30.715 --> 01:53:32.016]  The rising phoenix.
[01:53:32.016 --> 01:53:34.297]  People think the rising phoenix is a symbolism.
[01:53:34.297 --> 01:53:34.758]  Well, it is.
[01:53:34.758 --> 01:53:36.859]  The Luciferians are using it as their own symbol.
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:39.641]  They stole the Rising Sun?
[01:53:39.641 --> 01:53:49.126]  No, they stole the Rising Sun, but the Rising Phoenix originally was always in the ancient world, in early Christianity, a symbolism of Jesus Christ rising from the dead.
[01:53:49.126 --> 01:53:50.107]  That's what a phoenix is.
[01:53:50.107 --> 01:53:53.609]  And in closing, you talked about this, they got a movie coming out about Jack Parsons called Strange Angel.
[01:53:53.609 --> 01:53:53.929]  Right.
[01:53:53.929 --> 01:53:58.272]  He was the, explain what he did with Crowley on record, and there's always this sweet guy.
[01:53:58.272 --> 01:54:01.413]  Now, Crowley reportedly killed his own son in a ritual.
[01:54:01.413 --> 01:54:04.615]  Yes, actually, Crowley was one of the wickedest men to ever live in the world.
[01:54:04.615 --> 01:54:07.357]  If you look up this guy and do a little research on him, it's gonna blow your wiggate.
[01:54:08.117 --> 01:54:13.801]  And they are completely, he's completely worshipped by Hollywood, by the Luciferians, by the elites.
[01:54:13.801 --> 01:54:16.443]  This guy's a pillar in their history and all that stuff.
[01:54:16.443 --> 01:54:21.286]  But he went to the pyramids in Egypt to do this crazy ritual back in the 20s or 30s or something.
[01:54:21.286 --> 01:54:22.987]  He took Jack Parsons with him.
[01:54:22.987 --> 01:54:30.132]  And well, part of the ritual, of course, as many of you understand, their rituals are sex rituals and blood rituals and it's nasty.
[01:54:30.132 --> 01:54:34.075]  They got to do the nastiest stuff in order to gain their worldly stuff that they got to do.
[01:54:34.075 --> 01:54:35.596]  It's a miserable life when you think about it.
[01:54:35.916 --> 01:54:40.280]  The reason why they're doing it is because they want to degrade the image of God.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:42.021]  We were made in the image of God.
[01:54:42.021 --> 01:54:44.043]  We are made in the image of God.
[01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:45.745]  You are made in the image of God.
[01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:46.745]  Don't forget that.
[01:54:46.745 --> 01:54:57.335]  And so when Satan has his minions doing all these terrible things, rituals, blood rituals, sex rituals, homosexual rituals, all of this stuff is to degrade the image of God in any way he can.
[01:54:58.095 --> 01:55:00.097]  In fact, think about that from now on.
[01:55:00.097 --> 01:55:01.538]  Don't degrade the image of God.
[01:55:01.538 --> 01:55:03.319]  Don't degrade yourself.
[01:55:03.319 --> 01:55:04.440]  It's very important.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:09.784]  Now, the, uh, uh, and what were we talking about right before that, Alex?
[01:55:09.784 --> 01:55:11.165]  Jack Parsons.
[01:55:11.165 --> 01:55:13.166]  They went out there, look this up, it's fascinating.
[01:55:13.166 --> 01:55:14.147]  They went out there to the pyramids.
[01:55:14.147 --> 01:55:19.231]  He did this crazy ritual that he studied for years to do this one ritual, Alice Crawley.
[01:55:19.231 --> 01:55:20.632]  And he took Jack Parsons with him.
[01:55:20.632 --> 01:55:24.394]  He had to anally rape him before the ritual, as part of the ritual.
[01:55:24.394 --> 01:55:25.996]  And, uh, they did it and...
[01:55:26.656 --> 01:55:31.438]  This opened a portal, and a real demon manifested to Aleister Crowley.
[01:55:31.438 --> 01:55:34.999]  And basically, Aleister Crowley, he drew the image of what he saw.
[01:55:34.999 --> 01:55:37.740]  If you see that image, it looks like the alien greys.
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:40.241]  So don't forget, the aliens are demons in disguise.
[01:55:40.241 --> 01:55:42.021]  There's no aliens from other planets.
[01:55:42.021 --> 01:55:43.062]  They're demons in disguise.
[01:55:43.062 --> 01:55:49.464]  The Bible talks to us about a final deception on mankind that's going to be the ultimate mother of all deceptions.
[01:55:49.464 --> 01:55:49.664]  Exactly!
[01:55:49.664 --> 01:55:52.085]  The experiments have like Apache helicopters carved in them and everything.
[01:55:52.085 --> 01:55:52.325]  Yes!
[01:55:52.785 --> 01:55:56.847]  Yes, well the ancient world had, people were finding out a lot of stuff.
[01:55:56.847 --> 01:56:00.428]  In the pre-Deluvian, the deluge was the flood.
[01:56:00.428 --> 01:56:05.230]  So the world before the flood, if you understand what that world looked like, it was very different than here.
[01:56:05.230 --> 01:56:09.091]  Did you know that there was higher advanced technology in the ancient world than here?
[01:56:09.091 --> 01:56:13.553]  The Bible tells us people lived for 800-900 years at that time before the flood.
[01:56:13.553 --> 01:56:16.454]  After the flood, God shortened our lifespan out of mercy.
[01:56:16.454 --> 01:56:19.855]  Because when you live for 800-900 years, that's that much more time for sin to corrupt.
[01:56:19.855 --> 01:56:19.995]  I think?
[01:56:40.552 --> 01:56:42.573]  With an average career of 30-40 years.
[01:56:42.573 --> 01:56:50.999]  Well, imagine if everybody at the same time had an 800-900 lifespan years, and an average career of whatever they're doing, 30-300-400 years.
[01:56:50.999 --> 01:56:52.500]  By the way, they were smarter and more intelligent.
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:53.280]  Do you know why?
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.562]  They were closer to the original DNA of Adam.
[01:56:56.683 --> 01:57:04.007]  It's been breaking down like when you take a picture of something and then you photocopy that image and photocopy that and what happens to the image?
[01:57:04.007 --> 01:57:04.668]  It degrades.
[01:57:04.668 --> 01:57:05.749]  That's where we're at.
[01:57:05.749 --> 01:57:07.330]  We're several generations removed from it.
[01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:12.013]  But if you get closer to Adam in generations, they were stronger, faster, smarter.
[01:57:12.013 --> 01:57:13.194]  And they've now dug up the bones.
[01:57:13.194 --> 01:57:15.295]  They're saying twice as strong people even a thousand years ago.
[01:57:15.455 --> 01:57:16.155]  Yes, right.
[01:57:16.155 --> 01:57:16.856]  They were.
[01:57:16.856 --> 01:57:18.757]  And so, think about the technology they had.
[01:57:18.757 --> 01:57:22.800]  That's why you see... You know, there's a verse in the Bible that says, There's nothing new under the sun.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.702]  What there is now existed before in the ancient world.
[01:57:25.702 --> 01:57:31.266]  You can't look at some... See, the Bible says, you can't say this... So Plato writes about it, and everything else he did, they admit it's history.
[01:57:31.266 --> 01:57:32.727]  So what was Atlantis from your research?
[01:57:32.727 --> 01:57:39.171]  Atlantis was definitely one of the... It was actually the ruling state of the ancient world.
[01:57:39.171 --> 01:57:39.831]  It was.
[01:57:39.831 --> 01:57:41.913]  It was a one world government in the ancient world.
[01:57:41.913 --> 01:57:43.454]  And this is before the flood.
[01:57:43.454 --> 01:57:45.375]  Remember, the Tower of Babel was after the flood.
[01:57:47.298 --> 01:57:49.200]  We can't extend this free show.
[01:57:52.389 --> 01:57:52.889]  We're good to go.
[01:58:17.879 --> 01:58:18.179]  Thank you.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:55.831]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:58:55.831 --> 01:58:56.291]  It's you!
[01:58:57.403 --> 01:58:59.904]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:58:59.904 --> 01:59:01.224]  You are the info war.
[01:59:01.224 --> 01:59:04.185]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:29.937]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:59:29.937 --> 01:59:37.921]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:37.921 --> 01:59:44.965]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:59:44.965 --> 01:59:47.707]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:59:51.414 --> 01:59:54.026]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
