[00:00:01.582 --> 00:00:12.031]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:22.120]  University numbers show us that governments killed conservatively, according to what study you looked at, between 200 and 300 plus million people in the 20th century.
[00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.269]  That practice is called Democide.
[00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:37.851]  There's been a big body of work put out by several professors at the University of Hawaii.
[00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:55.474]  The reason I opened the broadcast up with that is a lot of people are in denial out there, and they don't think that a nuclear war or a new world war could happen, even though most mainline historians, most futurists, most analysts say that we're closer to that than we've ever been.
[00:00:56.783 --> 00:01:10.307]  And then you've got neocons like John McCain and others that have had the Pentagon put out policy reports last decade legitimizing the survivability of a complete thermal nuclear war on the face of this earth.
[00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:15.368]  Or the legitimate use of small tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:01:15.368 --> 00:01:25.071]  Also they write about the legitimization of race-specific bio-weapons to wipe out certain
[00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:32.410]  Groups with certain genomes, certain races of humans.
[00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.211]  This is the world we live in.
[00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:36.872]  And then you've got the Russians with 10,000 nuclear weapons.
[00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:38.773]  You've got them in Syria for six years.
[00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:43.636]  You've got them there for decades with their only Mediterranean port, Tartus.
[00:01:45.925 --> 00:02:02.839]  And you've got Obama and Hillary starting the Arab Spring six and a half years ago, trying to topple that nation, toppling our ally Egypt, toppling Libya, putting in people even worse, engaging in mass exterminations of men, women, and children.
[00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:13.668]  Hillary bragging about how she came, she saw he died, in between bragging about how she'd been in combat in airfields in Eastern Europe, Brian Williams type behavior.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.787]  They are now trying to strike Syria and reportedly they have 70 targets they want Trump to hit.
[00:02:23.787 --> 00:02:27.590]  20 plus are Russian targets.
[00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.698]  Now the Russians have already pulled out most of their forces because they have declared victory over the Western-backed Al-Qaeda, Wahhabi-slash-ISIS groups, al-Nusra and others.
[00:02:39.895 --> 00:03:00.519]  And so the fact that this chemical attack came a few days after Trump called for us to pull out, the last three chemical attacks were found by the Pentagon, by the UN, by everybody, to be the jihadis trying to blame it on Assad, and that Assad's only hope of being defeated by the jihadis is to stage a chemical attack.
[00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.720]  So you have the history of the jihadis doing it, you have the motive, you have the background, and now you have the Russian ambassador
[00:03:06.943 --> 00:03:07.523]  To the U.N.
[00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:09.165]  giving a speech yesterday at the U.N.
[00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:11.787]  in the morning that got no coverage in the U.S.
[00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:14.028]  but in full force.
[00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:18.152]  Then again, he went on national European television and talked about it as well.
[00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:22.014]  Those clips are coming up in the next segment and said, we have evidence that U.S.
[00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:23.115]  backed rebels.
[00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:24.556]  That doesn't mean Trump entirely.
[00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:26.258]  There's all these factions.
[00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.756]  Are training them to carry out chemical attacks.
[00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:33.139]  Well the Russians didn't just say this yesterday, they said this a month ago.
[00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.681]  The stories on Infowars.com, video.
[00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:42.748]  Russia accuses US of training jihadists to stage chemical attacks in Syria.
[00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:45.290]  So this broke yesterday at the UN.
[00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.752]  You'd think you'd find it on the news.
[00:03:47.752 --> 00:03:48.333]  I looked.
[00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:52.797]  It's nowhere but Zero Hedge and Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:03:53.766 --> 00:04:19.410]  Now, Rand Paul, Senator Rand Paul, Senator Cruz and others, back when our military, this broadcast is the tip of the spear, our audience is the real power, after Benghazi found out from Colonel Schaefer and others here on air that it was a resupply mission to the jihadis to take over Syria, that Hillary and Obama were behind it, and so our military, by the thousands, held up signs over their faces and said online, I will not be Al Qaeda and ISIS's air force.
[00:04:21.307 --> 00:04:27.611]  That forced our military, the brass, to do the right thing and tell Obama we're not going to back this.
[00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:37.436]  They made a deal with the Russians to come in, knock them out, it took five years to do it, and a lot of lives, and now again the globalists hope we've forgotten they're trying to kickstart
[00:04:38.874 --> 00:04:48.844]  This whole thing yet again, and so that's why this is so important, because there's a very good chance this will trigger a wider regional war, maybe a new world war, perhaps a nuclear war.
[00:04:48.844 --> 00:04:57.572]  You don't want to play Russian roulette with a situation like that, and we have a chance to get this information out and turn this around, but we've got to get really active.
[00:04:57.572 --> 00:04:58.053]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.888 --> 00:05:01.669]  I'm so excited.
[00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:11.815]  The new product, M4WarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:05:11.815 --> 00:05:20.341]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:29.127]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:50.794]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:05:50.794 --> 00:05:53.475]  It is amazing!
[00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:58.437]  Redpill, now available at Infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:15.763]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:06:15.763 --> 00:06:17.245]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:06:23.263 --> 00:06:36.971]  Well, President Trump, who I really admire and who I think overall is a great man who wants to restore this country to its former greatness and who wants to de-escalate conflicts around the world and let the United States dominate the planet via economic prowess, as it once did.
[00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:38.032]  I think he's a great man.
[00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:48.098]  And I went yesterday morning and stood in front of the White House and directly addressed the President, and I said, your tweets, putting down Russia, blaming them for the attack in Syria,
[00:06:49.858 --> 00:06:53.480]  With no evidence, are outrageous, and are incredibly dangerous.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:02.727]  And I said, I know in a Machiavellian way, you may be trying to dent the neocons and the media, claiming you're a Russian operative, and we're wanting you to go to war.
[00:07:02.727 --> 00:07:11.793]  So instead of war, kind of like WWE, World Wrestling, you are just putting out some rhetoric.
[00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:14.535]  But Russia didn't take it like that.
[00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:17.257]  I understand that North Korea was already making outrageous threats.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.361]  So you made some threats back, and that brought them to the table.
[00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:26.784]  You were proven right again, and I backed you on that from the beginning.
[00:07:26.784 --> 00:07:43.793]  Now this latest event, where you want to strike 70 targets inside Syria, where Syria and Russia have just defeated ISIS after a bitter six-year war, is wrong.
[00:07:43.793 --> 00:07:46.994]  And I said that.
[00:07:46.994 --> 00:07:47.875]  The good news is,
[00:07:49.062 --> 00:07:58.366]  Trump has now come out and said that he never said when he was going to strike Syria.
[00:07:58.366 --> 00:07:59.007]  There's the tweet.
[00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:02.028]  Never said when an attack on Syria would take place.
[00:08:02.028 --> 00:08:03.009]  Could be very soon.
[00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:03.609]  Not at all.
[00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.890]  Or not at all.
[00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:13.694]  In any event, the United States, under my administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS.
[00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:15.815]  Where is our thank you, America?
[00:08:17.794 --> 00:08:19.255]  Where is Russia's thinking?
[00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:22.357]  Because they did about 90% of it according to our own military.
[00:08:22.357 --> 00:08:23.558]  That's just a fact.
[00:08:23.558 --> 00:08:25.039]  I'm not a Russophile.
[00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:26.139]  I'm just stating the facts.
[00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:36.846]  So, now Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, has come out, the former Marine Corps General,
[00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:55.114]  And said that we have no evidence that Russia did this, and that we should cool the saber-rattling rhetoric coming out of John McCain, coming out of the neocons, and coming out of John Bolton, who Trump just put in as his new National Security Advisor two weeks ago.
[00:08:55.114 --> 00:09:01.855]  And now we have this false flag that has John McCain's little dirty paws written all over it.
[00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:04.696]  That they're still
[00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:07.149]  Assessing it.
[00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:11.652]  I talked to some CIA folks yesterday and they said, believe me, it's all being assessed.
[00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:15.375]  No one is buying it.
[00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:16.255]  No one is...
[00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:18.762]  Believing it.
[00:09:18.762 --> 00:09:25.227]  Why would Assad attack some of his own civilians and then right when he's winning and then have the pretext to be bombed and taken out?
[00:09:25.227 --> 00:09:28.509]  Why right when the Russians are pulling out and right when the U.S.
[00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:30.030]  is announcing a pullout would this happen?
[00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.472]  This is so clear.
[00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:43.480]  Then I ran into some more, not high-level CIA folks, but some more CIA operatives at the airport and they were basically saying the same thing.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.243]  So I've talked to a bunch of CIA people in
[00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:48.079]  D.C.
[00:09:48.079 --> 00:10:02.172]  yesterday, in person, over the telephone, and at the airport, and we had a CIA airport inside the airport over there, and none of them, none of them are buying any of it.
[00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:08.547]  And several of them didn't even know who I was, but I was with another guy.
[00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:14.731]  And so they were all talking to him and we were sitting around waiting for the plane before the other guys got on a little taxi bus and went out to their plane.
[00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:20.954]  And that was basically the feel I got from six different people I talked to.
[00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.276]  They just all happened to be from the CIA.
[00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:25.417]  So that's what was going on yesterday.
[00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.478]  But Zero Hedge really gets it.
[00:10:27.478 --> 00:10:28.879]  And whoever Tyler Durgan is,
[00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:31.863]  is about as smart as it gets.
[00:10:31.863 --> 00:10:36.929]  There's Matt Drudge, there's Tyler Durgan, not from the movie, but the gnome to plume from Zero Hedge.
[00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:39.272]  And I'm not going to toot my own horn, but our guests are excellent.
[00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:45.018]  We've got Nigel Farage, obviously, who's out exposing this war, saying it's a bad idea, that Theresa May's crazy.
[00:10:45.018 --> 00:10:46.600]  He's going to be joining us coming up the next hour.
[00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:53.847]  We also have a former high-level advisor from the Kremlin joining us to talk about what this war could look like if the U.S.
[00:10:53.847 --> 00:10:59.072]  does attack, how it could quickly, in just a matter of hours or days, get out of hand.
[00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:02.635]  And the media will then say that I'm a Russian operative for having a Russian on.
[00:11:02.635 --> 00:11:05.678]  No, when I have Nigel Farage on, I don't work for the British government.
[00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.811]  When I talk to a Russian, I don't work for the Russians.
[00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:20.415]  When I talk to six different CIA operatives, and some of them bosses over their operations, they all basically say the same thing.
[00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:27.398]  So that's what we do, is we sample a large sampling of people, and then I have my own historical research.
[00:11:27.398 --> 00:11:31.299]  But here's the article, I've had it posted up at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:34.080]  Six simple reasons why Trump is going to war in Syria.
[00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:37.289]  We're going to cover this when we come back.
[00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:38.490]  The petrodollar.
[00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.210]  John McCain, the Deep State President.
[00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.791]  That's what he is, President of the Deep State.
[00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:48.052]  Call him President of the Democratic Party, President of the Deep State, President of the coup government.
[00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:50.752]  Number three, Saudi Arabia and the MBS.
[00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.573]  Number four, Israel wants it.
[00:11:52.573 --> 00:11:56.554]  Number five, cover up past and present American Deep State false flags in Syria.
[00:11:56.554 --> 00:12:01.575]  Number six, distract from Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.
[00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:02.655]  And that's just some of them.
[00:12:04.227 --> 00:12:09.809]  So excellent, excellent points in all of those.
[00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:11.510]  And again, when I talk to Russians, don't work for them.
[00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.671]  When I talk to the CIA, don't work for them.
[00:12:13.671 --> 00:12:17.172]  When I talk to the British, don't work for them.
[00:12:17.172 --> 00:12:18.253]  I am an American.
[00:12:18.253 --> 00:12:21.474]  I work for the truth.
[00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:23.635]  All right, let's get back into these clips.
[00:12:23.635 --> 00:12:26.996]  This is the best sign yet, and it shows you the fight going on.
[00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.157]  Remember last year?
[00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:33.295]  When McMaster said, we're going to go all the way to Damascus and take out Assad too.
[00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:36.458]  Once the Russians had taken out ISIS.
[00:12:36.458 --> 00:12:40.661]  Well, that isn't the agreement the Pentagon had five years ago with the Russians.
[00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:42.783]  In countervailance of Obama's treason.
[00:12:42.783 --> 00:12:44.905]  That was a big American wake-up call.
[00:12:44.905 --> 00:12:46.386]  We found our soul again.
[00:12:46.386 --> 00:12:49.148]  Well, we're finding it again this time if we get the word out.
[00:12:49.148 --> 00:12:52.731]  But now Trump coming out saying, okay, we'll blast them, we'll get them.
[00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:56.694]  You know, you Russians say you're going to shoot down our missiles when they're coming to blow up your troops.
[00:12:56.694 --> 00:12:58.616]  Well, we'll really take it to you.
[00:12:59.548 --> 00:13:00.148]  That's crazy.
[00:13:00.148 --> 00:13:02.910]  I don't know what Trump was doing, but we'll see.
[00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.851]  We heard about this 4 and 5D chess.
[00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:05.351]  We'll see.
[00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:07.832]  But I don't want to play around with Russia and nuclear weapons.
[00:13:07.832 --> 00:13:12.714]  It might work with Kim Jong-un, because none of his really worked very well yet.
[00:13:12.714 --> 00:13:18.137]  But you've got Mattis coming out, Secretary of Defense.
[00:13:18.137 --> 00:13:20.278]  Well, here, let's just hear from him what he has to say.
[00:13:21.015 --> 00:13:25.780]  Mr. Secretary, have you seen enough evidence that took away the Assad regime from this most recent chemical attack?
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.462]  Have you seen evidence confident to make that assumption?
[00:13:28.462 --> 00:13:34.608]  We're still assessing the intelligence ourselves and our allies, but we're still working on this.
[00:13:34.608 --> 00:13:35.069]  Is the U.S.
[00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:39.413]  military ready right now to conduct a counter-retaliatory strike, if ordered?
[00:13:40.013 --> 00:13:41.434]  So there you go.
[00:13:41.434 --> 00:13:46.575]  Now, hopefully that shows that sanity is prevailing and that the big kids are in charge, because
[00:14:04.138 --> 00:14:19.298]  There's a very good chance that when the Russians strike back against our ships and we see sinking destroyers, that then we're going to hit bigger Russian targets and then it's off the races because the Russian military position is just like ours.
[00:14:19.298 --> 00:14:22.562]  If they're hit first and they're overwhelmed, you go to tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:14:26.067 --> 00:14:29.070]  So we're talking minutes, hours, days, boom, this could happen.
[00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:37.858]  You go to sleep, you wake up and ICBMs are popping open, coming back into the atmosphere and releasing their MIRV payloads.
[00:14:37.858 --> 00:14:42.662]  That means a whole bunch of warheads hitting different targets.
[00:14:42.662 --> 00:14:47.906]  Now a lot of media is pointing out that the Russians have pulled out of their main port
[00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:51.700]  Tardis, but they've already pulled out.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.203]  The Russians have already pulled out 90% of their forces.
[00:14:55.203 --> 00:14:56.724]  They already left.
[00:14:56.724 --> 00:14:57.785]  They're already gone.
[00:14:57.785 --> 00:15:10.096]  They're trying to leave, and there's still some military bases and some air bases that are evacuating out Russians, because it's mission accomplished, but for real this time, not like Bush out on the aircraft carrier wearing his codpiece.
[00:15:10.096 --> 00:15:11.978]  And so they're trying to stop that.
[00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:14.100]  They don't want peace to break out.
[00:15:15.572 --> 00:15:25.517]  We're going to continue with these key clips and more on the other side, and I'll get more into the six reasons why Trump is under pressure and may still do this, and why it's so important for all of us to have maximum effort.
[00:15:25.517 --> 00:15:27.698]  It's stop a new world war.
[00:15:27.698 --> 00:15:29.239]  Stop a world war with Russia.
[00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:30.459]  34-hour broadcast.
[00:15:30.459 --> 00:15:31.720]  You're listening to us on local radio.

[00:15:42.003 --> 00:15:51.846]  And also spread the live links at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com of the live video feed of this show and the broadcast and the local radio station you're listening to.
[00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:52.906]  That's so critical.
[00:15:52.906 --> 00:15:54.586]  At the grocery store, at church, at work.
[00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:56.887]  Tell them about the local station you're listening to.
[00:15:56.887 --> 00:15:57.547]  It is critical.
[00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:02.024]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.
[00:16:02.024 --> 00:16:05.327]  This is a money-saving message from Tax Mediation Services.

[00:16:37.938 --> 00:16:38.738]  You have been lied to.
[00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.852]  My name is Kevin Schipp.
[00:17:02.852 --> 00:17:05.555]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:10.881]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:16.567]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:17:16.567 --> 00:17:19.650]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.

[00:18:09.277 --> 00:18:17.403]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.683 --> 00:18:22.544]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:19:04.572 --> 00:19:05.413]  Devon in Florida.
[00:19:05.413 --> 00:19:05.814]  You're on the air.
[00:19:06.795 --> 00:19:07.255]  Great!
[00:19:07.255 --> 00:19:08.376]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:19:08.376 --> 00:19:12.899]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say, they're amazing.
[00:19:12.899 --> 00:19:14.600]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:22.985]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor... Wow, thank you.
[00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:25.407]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:19:25.407 --> 00:19:26.968]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.669]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:31.089]  That's amazing.
[00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:31.949]  That's really incredible.
[00:19:31.949 --> 00:19:35.350]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.370]  I haven't felt sweet.
[00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.031]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:19:38.031 --> 00:19:39.271]  And I love you guys.
[00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:41.432]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:19:41.432 --> 00:19:48.293]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:19:48.293 --> 00:19:49.333]  You will love it.
[00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:49.834]  I'm telling you.
[00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:51.114]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:19:51.454 --> 00:19:55.898]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:55.898 --> 00:19:56.759]  It's a win-win.
[00:19:56.759 --> 00:20:03.746]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:03.746 --> 00:20:06.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.677 --> 00:20:23.998]  You found it.
[00:20:23.998 --> 00:20:26.180]  The tip of the spear.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.522]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:47.188]  So, most mainline analysts agree the United States and Russia are in a protracted long-term strategic war that the West has started since the fall of the Soviet Union to take over the former satellites.
[00:20:47.188 --> 00:20:51.829]  And George Soros has been captaining those operations, including inside Russia.
[00:20:51.829 --> 00:20:54.350]  They overthrew Ukraine in an elected government four years ago.
[00:20:55.865 --> 00:21:00.490]  The same globalists are trying to overthrow our system here and bring in a tyranny.
[00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.873]  And so Russia faces really the same enemies as the United States.
[00:21:03.873 --> 00:21:09.799]  When John McCain claims he's this big patriot, he wants your guns, he wants open borders, he's a globalist.
[00:21:09.799 --> 00:21:13.202]  He wants to make sure that we don't have our own energy supply.
[00:21:13.202 --> 00:21:19.968]  He wants to use American power for global domination for a select group of corporations that are anti-American, anti-God.
[00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:26.562]  But regardless, we started the war, that is the globalists in control of our country, not the American people, against Syria.
[00:21:26.562 --> 00:21:29.864]  They started the Arab Spring.
[00:21:29.864 --> 00:21:34.046]  And they're mad that the Russians and our own military were successful defeating ISIS.
[00:21:34.046 --> 00:21:40.030]  So they've rebranded Al-Qaeda into ISIS, now they've rebranded it into a new group, and the Russians have come out, their ambassador.
[00:21:42.148 --> 00:21:48.933]  Vassily Nabinzia and have said that they have evidence and that they tracked U.S.
[00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:55.359]  forces there training the rebels to stage provocations including chemical attacks and they warned of this two months ago.
[00:21:55.359 --> 00:22:03.005]  Then days after Trump says we're going to pull our troops out of Syria, mission accomplished, the Russians were shocked saying well you're going to keep your agreement.
[00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:05.018]  Boom!
[00:22:05.018 --> 00:22:06.679]  The chemical attack happens.
[00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:08.960]  Now, they've got the British ambassador to Syria.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.822]  He's saying it's staged by the rebels and that they're jerking our chain.
[00:22:11.822 --> 00:22:14.703]  Every time they do this, we can be called back in.
[00:22:14.703 --> 00:22:15.744]  It's very dangerous.
[00:22:15.744 --> 00:22:17.465]  Well, the Russians say they have the evidence.
[00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:20.887]  So, here is some of the video from the U.N.
[00:22:20.887 --> 00:22:21.707]  yesterday.
[00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:24.769]  But where is this in our news?
[00:22:24.769 --> 00:22:25.529]  You know, the U.N.
[00:22:25.529 --> 00:22:28.611]  found three years ago that the rebels had been caught staging the chemical attack.
[00:22:28.611 --> 00:22:30.852]  They tested it, found it was Saudi Arabian in origin.
[00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:51.956]  When Ron Paul came on my show and talked about it, they used that in an internal Google document to announce they were hiring an outside company to go out and delist InfoWars off of Google, saying we were fake news, that Ron Paul and the UN were wrong.
[00:22:51.956 --> 00:22:52.736]  See how that works?
[00:22:52.736 --> 00:22:55.177]  And that's why they're filing a lawsuit against us a week.
[00:22:55.177 --> 00:22:56.617]  They're totally frivolous.
[00:22:56.617 --> 00:22:57.837]  We're kicking them out.
[00:22:57.837 --> 00:22:59.918]  We got another one dismissed last week.
[00:22:59.918 --> 00:23:02.339]  Still cost me about $10,000 to get it dismissed and lawyers fees.
[00:23:03.772 --> 00:23:05.053]  Just got another notice this morning.
[00:23:05.053 --> 00:23:06.273]  I'll be telling you about next week.
[00:23:06.273 --> 00:23:08.094]  I'm going to tell you about this before it gets filed.
[00:23:08.094 --> 00:23:09.375]  It's incredibly fraudulent.
[00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:11.236]  And it's going to be big news.
[00:23:11.236 --> 00:23:13.957]  But they're coming after us because we have a memory.
[00:23:13.957 --> 00:23:18.179]  And we'll show you stuff they don't want you to see, like the Russian ambassador.
[00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:18.539]  Here it is.
[00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:34.222]  Also information is surfacing that at Tanf, the camp, American instructors trained a number of groups of fighters to stage provocations with chemical weapons used to create a pretext for a strike.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:52.383]  It was clear to us that the attempt to shelter terrorists and at the same time to punish the regime so hated by some Western capitals will sooner or later be undertaken.
[00:23:52.383 --> 00:24:00.524]  Speaking heads on television screens sought to repeat last year's attack against Syria.
[00:24:04.285 --> 00:24:11.771]  Last year's strike, this morning, there were strikes, missile strikes against the Tifroir airfield in Homs province.
[00:24:11.771 --> 00:24:15.614]  We are deeply troubled by such actions.
[00:24:15.614 --> 00:24:20.357]  Provocations in Douma echo last year's incident in Khan Sheikhoun.
[00:24:21.658 --> 00:24:27.041]  The unifying moment aspect is the fact that there's a planned nature of these attacks.
[00:24:27.041 --> 00:24:28.501]  Analysis of the U.S.'
[00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:37.306]  's operations prior to and after the incident in Hon Shukun in April 2007 shows that Washington ahead of time prepared for its operation.
[00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:41.208]  The U.S.
[00:24:41.208 --> 00:24:54.475]  Porter and Ross naval destroyers from 4 to 7 April last year, that is when the toxic substance was used in Han Shi Hun before the strike against the Sherat Air Base,
[00:24:54.895 --> 00:25:01.179]  We're already present in the Mediterranean waters where they were engaged in planned operations.
[00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:09.906]  They did not enter the ports where an exchange of munitions could have been taken place by increasing the number of cruise missiles.
[00:25:11.407 --> 00:25:16.051]  That is Vasily Nabinzia, the main Russian ambassador to the United Nations.
[00:25:16.051 --> 00:25:19.494]  Now you'd think that that'd be big news and it goes on for 20 more minutes.
[00:25:19.494 --> 00:25:20.655]  It's all bombshell.
[00:25:20.655 --> 00:25:22.457]  The full video is on Infowars.com.
[00:25:22.457 --> 00:25:23.418]  Video.
[00:25:23.418 --> 00:25:28.562]  Russia accuses US of training jihadists to stage chemical attacks in Syria.
[00:25:28.562 --> 00:25:30.144]  It's incredible.
[00:25:30.144 --> 00:25:31.785]  Nowhere in US news.
[00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:34.168]  Not even in the Liberty Base news except for Zero Hedge.
[00:25:35.322 --> 00:25:38.405]  And I'm not bashing anybody, but this is so unknown.
[00:25:38.405 --> 00:25:46.092]  I came in this morning and the morning crew, who are awesome folks, didn't even know because our news had scrolled off from last night.
[00:25:46.092 --> 00:25:48.994]  There was so much new news.
[00:25:48.994 --> 00:25:57.242]  I just so happened to be scrolling through news alerts and
[00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:04.362]  I happened to see it yesterday and then read the transcript as the plane was about to take off in D.C.
[00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:05.182]  and I called the crew.
[00:26:05.182 --> 00:26:07.883]  And I'm not saying, oh look, I'm so smart, I caught it, I found it.
[00:26:07.883 --> 00:26:08.944]  This is nowhere.
[00:26:08.944 --> 00:26:09.944]  How huge is this?
[00:26:09.944 --> 00:26:17.388]  Here's the headline, Russia denies doing the chemical attack, says deep state forces staged it with the rebels.
[00:26:17.388 --> 00:26:24.391]  And that's where the evidence points, that's where the motive points, the same people have been caught doing it before.
[00:26:24.391 --> 00:26:26.252]  So I align myself with the truth.
[00:26:27.216 --> 00:26:29.697]  And the globalists are trying to overturn sovereign nations.
[00:26:29.697 --> 00:26:40.741]  I'm all about Viktor Orban just winning in Hungary by a huge landslide re-election despite Soros reportedly putting 50 million dollars in against him.
[00:26:40.741 --> 00:26:49.825]  He's like Ron Paul, super libertarian, wants a second amendment for their people, totally Christian, totally family, radical, you know, Islam is the enemy.
[00:26:50.885 --> 00:26:53.067]  Brazil's got a guy about to be elected.
[00:26:53.067 --> 00:26:55.590]  He's way ahead in the polls, wants the same thing.
[00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:03.138]  Most of the movements are like Ron Paul, Infowars, Donald Trump-esque.
[00:27:03.138 --> 00:27:07.443]  And that's what's exciting, and the globalists are trying to crush that, and Russia's going in that direction.
[00:27:07.443 --> 00:27:09.706]  Why wouldn't we want Russia going in that direction?
[00:27:11.172 --> 00:27:27.106]  Well, the same globalists that hate this country and hate our freedoms, they have been stealing our energy, stealing our name, stealing our treasure, stealing our blood with our troops that die, our taxpayers, breaking our backs to pay for this global empire that's against us too!
[00:27:27.106 --> 00:27:29.048]  I'm all about 1776 worldwide.
[00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:33.732]  I'm all about us being the best, having the biggest military, the strongest, the best industry, the best science.
[00:27:33.732 --> 00:27:36.315]  You get in our way, you try to push us around, we smash you.
[00:27:37.298 --> 00:27:46.127]  But I'm not about having globalists that hate me more than they hate the Russians running my country and using me to go after them and then threatening the whole world with nuclear war!
[00:27:46.127 --> 00:27:48.770]  No, sir!
[00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:55.117]  Now, that said, we are listener-funded and we're under globalist attack, as you know, and I want to keep expanding, not just stay the same size in the brunt of this.
[00:27:55.117 --> 00:27:56.739]  We need you to go buy product.
[00:27:58.328 --> 00:28:00.790]  And it's only happened one other time in its five-year history.
[00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:07.395]  We're having some trouble, I'm told, by the manufacturer getting the Deep Earth Crystals for the purest of iodine out there.
[00:28:07.395 --> 00:28:18.843]  Survival Shield X2, and it looks like he'll probably be able to get more, but we're not gonna have any for a few months, and it really is gonna sell out at this current rate in about a week, so I'm gonna have to cut the 25% off in the next few days.
[00:28:18.843 --> 00:28:21.505]  Survival Shield X2, the amazing, good halogen.

[00:29:29.598 --> 00:29:30.419]  This is Dan Pillett.
[00:29:30.419 --> 00:29:32.200]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.862]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:29:33.862 --> 00:29:36.684]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:29:36.684 --> 00:29:38.986]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:29:38.986 --> 00:29:43.489]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[00:30:00.182 --> 00:30:19.038]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[00:30:19.358 --> 00:30:20.158]  The revolution.
[00:30:20.158 --> 00:30:22.279]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:25.999]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:30:41.342 --> 00:30:42.962]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA2533139.
[00:30:42.962 --> 00:30:44.482]  And you're purchasing the products
[00:30:47.603 --> 00:30:53.027]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:30:53.027 --> 00:30:57.490]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:31:01.209 --> 00:31:06.692]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:31:06.692 --> 00:31:07.532]  I take this.
[00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:08.653]  My family takes this.
[00:31:08.653 --> 00:31:12.955]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:31:12.955 --> 00:31:17.397]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:31:17.537 --> 00:31:22.179]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:23.319]  I don't feel good.
[00:31:23.319 --> 00:31:27.060]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.761]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:35.564]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:31:35.564 --> 00:31:38.525]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:31:38.525 --> 00:31:42.046]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[00:31:42.046 --> 00:31:44.287]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:31:44.287 --> 00:31:44.647]  I love it.
[00:31:44.807 --> 00:31:47.611]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:31:47.611 --> 00:31:48.632]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:48.632 --> 00:31:54.279]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:56.462]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:31:56.462 --> 00:31:57.703]  It's a win-win.
[00:31:57.703 --> 00:31:58.665]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:04.013]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[00:32:04.013 --> 00:32:11.077]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[00:32:11.077 --> 00:32:15.821]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:16.581]  It's very simple.
[00:32:16.581 --> 00:32:19.083]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:21.024]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[00:32:21.024 --> 00:32:22.825]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[00:32:22.825 --> 00:32:23.986]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[00:32:23.986 --> 00:32:24.727]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.892]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:32:32.892 --> 00:32:37.156]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:32:37.156 --> 00:32:40.999]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[00:32:40.999 --> 00:32:44.882]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:32:44.882 --> 00:32:48.044]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:32:48.044 --> 00:32:51.687]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[00:32:51.687 --> 00:32:54.289]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:55.290]  It's amazing.
[00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.892]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:33:03.287 --> 00:33:05.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:16.391 --> 00:33:26.034]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[00:33:26.034 --> 00:33:28.295]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[00:33:28.295 --> 00:33:33.857]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:34.917 --> 00:33:41.501]  Andrei Afanasyev has been on with us before and I appreciate him coming on today.
[00:33:41.501 --> 00:34:01.393]  He was on with Owen Schroyer during the Infowars transmission and didn't have time to get to his entire breakdown of the different nightmare scenarios that could take place if President Trump follows through with striking 70 different targets including more than 20 that have Russian troops or sailors staying there.
[00:34:02.293 --> 00:34:03.334]  Incredible.
[00:34:03.334 --> 00:34:06.738]  We've got six reasons why Trump could strike Syria.
[00:34:06.738 --> 00:34:11.063]  In fact, Tyler Durden predicts he will.
[00:34:11.063 --> 00:34:15.308]  The petrodollar, John McCain, the shadow government president, that's who he is.
[00:34:15.308 --> 00:34:17.451]  He's a globalist hardliner.
[00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:18.632]  Saudi Arabia wants it.
[00:34:18.632 --> 00:34:19.554]  Israel wants it.
[00:34:20.765 --> 00:34:28.414]  Cover up past and present, deep state false flags, and distract from Michael Cohen and the Stormy Daniels situation.
[00:34:28.414 --> 00:34:31.097]  Trump's original instincts were right on this.
[00:34:36.102 --> 00:34:38.223]  He's an advisor to the Kremlin.
[00:34:38.223 --> 00:34:44.965]  He's a journalist, TV host, and head of the political department at Russia's first independent pro-Christian conservative political TV channel.
[00:34:44.965 --> 00:34:50.427]  And he joins us, previously worked for RT, and currently authors and hosts the show, Russian Answer.
[00:34:50.427 --> 00:34:58.129]  And by the way, I love how George Soros, that owns and runs Media Matters, funds it, and People's American Way and all that are funded by him.
[00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:01.990]  Every time I have a Russian on, they say, look, he's a Russian agent.
[00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:04.591]  I'm going to have a Brit on, Nigel Farage, later.
[00:35:05.191 --> 00:35:16.518]  And I have Ron Paul on, and I have Donald Trump on, and I have Antifa folks I don't disagree with, but this bullying intellectually, this authoritarianism, that we're bad if we hear from Russia.
[00:35:16.518 --> 00:35:23.142]  The Russian ambassador came out, we just played the clip, and said they have evidence that last year and this latest attack were staged by the rebels.
[00:35:23.142 --> 00:35:24.683]  Even the UN has said that.
[00:35:24.683 --> 00:35:25.744]  The rebels bragged about it.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.660]  And there's a blackout in our news.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.381]  Americans want to know about this.
[00:35:30.381 --> 00:35:36.282]  Instead of having a couple million views a day on our YouTube channel, we're having like a couple extra million just on that.
[00:35:36.282 --> 00:35:41.304]  People are really interested in this and they don't want world war.
[00:35:41.304 --> 00:35:44.324]  So it's all up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:35:44.324 --> 00:35:49.766]  The good news is Mattis has come out and said they don't have evidence yet that Russia did this.
[00:35:49.766 --> 00:35:50.806]  He said that this morning.
[00:35:52.202 --> 00:35:53.283]  And he also said it yesterday.
[00:35:53.283 --> 00:35:54.484]  They're still assessing.
[00:35:54.484 --> 00:35:57.526]  So that shows that there's some sanity going on up there.
[00:35:57.526 --> 00:36:04.871]  Why would Trump, who I'm a big supporter of, shoot his mouth off against Russia without the evidence?
[00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:06.532]  Well, it's because they're putting heat on him, folks.
[00:36:06.532 --> 00:36:08.413]  They didn't find any Russia evidence.
[00:36:08.413 --> 00:36:10.154]  I can tell you that from the highest levels.
[00:36:10.154 --> 00:36:12.356]  But they are going to find something on his lawyers.
[00:36:12.356 --> 00:36:13.616]  They're going to find something in business.
[00:36:13.616 --> 00:36:14.657]  Nobody's perfect.
[00:36:14.657 --> 00:36:16.638]  They're going to find some mistake in bookkeeping.
[00:36:16.638 --> 00:36:20.561]  They're going to throw wire fraud charges against everybody in his family.
[00:36:20.561 --> 00:36:21.442]  And that's now happening.
[00:36:22.162 --> 00:36:37.197]  So, just like Rand Paul and others have said, the swamp is striking back, Alan Dershowitz has said it, this is dangerous to have this rogue FBI group run by the Clintons, running around witch hunting the President and everybody, and bullying the President into war with Russia.
[00:36:37.197 --> 00:36:38.278]  This is insane!
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:49.651]  The sanctions, the strikes, the bravado is way above anything in the Cold War as they successfully bully the president and try to show he's not a Russian agent.
[00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:51.233]  How about he just nukes the whole planet?
[00:36:51.233 --> 00:36:52.354]  How about that, President Trump?
[00:36:52.354 --> 00:36:53.315]  Just kill everybody!
[00:36:53.916 --> 00:37:03.803]  And then we'll have a dead planet to prove that you're not a Russian agent when Hillary got all this Russian money and Chinese money and tarmacs, giving the Russians uranium on tarmacs.
[00:37:03.803 --> 00:37:07.046]  It's unbelievable how the Clintons... See, I have my guest on.
[00:37:07.046 --> 00:37:11.008]  We'll have him in this segment, the next, and then a little five minutes because Nigel Farage is joining us.
[00:37:11.008 --> 00:37:15.192]  He'll get the five back he just lost with me ranting in the first five of the next hour.
[00:37:15.192 --> 00:37:16.352]  So, Andre, thank you.
[00:37:17.293 --> 00:37:18.595]  for coming on with us.
[00:37:18.595 --> 00:37:19.977]  There's so much to cover.
[00:37:19.977 --> 00:37:21.859]  Let's just get right to it.
[00:37:21.859 --> 00:37:32.374]  How dangerous this is, what the different scenarios are of how this could unravel very, very quickly if a bunch of Russians get killed for liberating Syria from ISIS, something President Trump is taking credit for.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.104]  Hello Alex, I'm happy to be with you and with the audience today.
[00:37:39.104 --> 00:37:49.893]  So there are, as I have already mentioned with Owen Schroer the day before, there are several scenarios and several possible outcomes of the current situation we are in now.
[00:37:50.493 --> 00:37:53.835]  So, the easiest way is that nothing happens.
[00:37:53.835 --> 00:38:06.501]  Trump just brings in the fleet to the Syrian coast, says, well, I'm great, America is great, everything's fine, Russians are back, Syrians are back, Iranians are scared, that's it, we're great.
[00:38:06.501 --> 00:38:13.285]  Several good tweets, several good headlines, everyone is happy, the pressure is a bit down on both sides.
[00:38:14.241 --> 00:38:17.585]  This variant is the perfect in current situation.
[00:38:17.585 --> 00:38:23.131]  It's definitely terrible to think that it's a perfect variant for us today, but it is.
[00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:25.874]  So, the next level of nightmare is...
[00:38:27.168 --> 00:38:40.936]  If something happens like a year before when the Americans, when the American Navy shot several dozens of Tomahawk missiles toward Khan Sheikhoun Air Base in Syria.
[00:38:40.936 --> 00:38:44.437]  It was a secondary object of Syrian infrastructure.
[00:38:44.437 --> 00:38:47.059]  It wasn't important.
[00:38:47.059 --> 00:38:53.082]  American troops told and they warned Russian troops that they're going to do this.
[00:38:53.082 --> 00:38:56.344]  So we withdrew all our units from there as well as
[00:38:57.017 --> 00:38:57.217]  I think?
[00:39:16.218 --> 00:39:24.582]  Well, Trump destroys some kind of secondary infrastructure, the pressure would be down, the globalists would be fed with this for a certain period of time.
[00:39:24.582 --> 00:39:25.963]  But they push for more.
[00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:26.563]  What is more?
[00:39:26.563 --> 00:39:32.345]  More is attacking Iran, that will bring another side in this conflict.
[00:39:32.345 --> 00:39:44.411]  And definitely Iran is bigger and stronger than Syria, and has more capabilities to retaliate towards US, that would provoke even a worse nightmare.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:59.104]  The next step is attacking the primary infrastructure of the capital, all the official buildings of Syria that would harm the core of political elite of the country.
[00:39:59.104 --> 00:40:04.966]  Because Assad, with all his disadvantages, is a brave person that hasn't fled the country.
[00:40:04.966 --> 00:40:08.307]  He's there with his people in his capital.
[00:40:08.985 --> 00:40:10.927]  Fighting with the terrorists, still.
[00:40:10.927 --> 00:40:19.095]  And technically, the United States can't kill him with tomahawks, because they don't have enough infrastructure to down all the rockets.
[00:40:19.095 --> 00:40:20.857]  They can down partly.
[00:40:20.857 --> 00:40:23.960]  That's the next step of a real nightmare.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:29.465]  Then comes the nightmare if Americans, if American troops will attack Russian conflict.
[00:40:30.339 --> 00:40:42.636]  It will mean that several members of so-called PWCs, private work companies, would be killed by American missiles, and deliberately.
[00:40:42.636 --> 00:40:47.303]  So in this case, there would be some kind of covert retaliation instead.
[00:40:48.104 --> 00:41:10.255]  And the worst scenario, the worst possible scenario is the direct attack on Russian military and Russian infrastructure in Syria that I will remind is there absolutely legally according to international law invited by a sovereign government of Syria to fight ISIS and to fight terrorists that are attacking everyone including the American society.
[00:41:10.735 --> 00:41:13.616]  So that would be the worst case scenario.
[00:41:13.616 --> 00:41:25.899]  So we've gone through the easiest thing that will be just some kind of a media and I would call it Twitter war to a real war between our nations.
[00:41:25.899 --> 00:41:30.099]  We in Russia definitely are not interested in a war with the US.
[00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:32.280]  We are not interested in a war at all with anyone.
[00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:36.294]  We're a peaceful nation no matter what globalist media tell about us.
[00:41:36.294 --> 00:41:37.235]  We don't need anything.
[00:41:37.235 --> 00:41:38.376]  We have enough resources.
[00:41:38.376 --> 00:41:39.818]  We have enough land.
[00:41:39.818 --> 00:41:43.542]  We have everything you can possibly need.
[00:41:43.542 --> 00:41:49.829]  So there is no objective mean to start a war by Russia.
[00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:51.231]  So US is pushed
[00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:53.552]  Into a war with Russia.
[00:41:53.552 --> 00:41:54.092]  Not us.
[00:41:54.092 --> 00:41:55.693]  They cannot push us now.
[00:41:55.693 --> 00:42:01.336]  And we hope that our fellow Americans understand that it's nothing but a provocation.
[00:42:01.336 --> 00:42:12.081]  And the American society, sane American politicians, sane American journalists like you, Alex, and your colleagues must do everything to prevent it.
[00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:19.405]  And me, personally, as a Russian citizen, as an expert, as a journalist, I'm ready to do anything to prevent it.
[00:42:20.214 --> 00:42:23.261]  Even to risk my life and health to do this.
[00:42:23.261 --> 00:42:24.283]  To help you.
[00:42:24.283 --> 00:42:26.067]  Because it's really important now.
[00:42:26.067 --> 00:42:27.550]  We're really in trouble.
[00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.635]  But there is still a chance to change it.
[00:42:30.299 --> 00:42:36.984]  The thing is that we need to establish as many informal contacts as possible among our people, both in the U.S.
[00:42:36.984 --> 00:42:37.764]  and in Russia.
[00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:40.526]  That's maybe the most important thing now.
[00:42:40.526 --> 00:42:41.267]  All right, stay there.
[00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:46.270]  We've got an expert, a national TV host in Russia breaking this down.
[00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:51.914]  And we're going to go over more of it on the other side, because this could lead to a nuclear war.
[00:42:51.914 --> 00:42:54.015]  Again, this is in Russia's back door.
[00:42:54.015 --> 00:42:55.156]  They were invited in by Assad.
[00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:56.437]  They helped defeat ISIS.
[00:42:56.437 --> 00:42:57.698]  Now the neocons are striking back.
[00:42:59.525 --> 00:43:05.803]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:44:08.289 --> 00:44:09.470]  It's stronger.
[00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:11.091]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:44:11.091 --> 00:44:14.314]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:44:14.314 --> 00:44:15.415]  It's back in stock.
[00:44:15.415 --> 00:44:18.598]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.

[00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:22.501]  Yeah.

[00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:44.479]  Without you, we couldn't do it.

[00:45:59.974 --> 00:46:02.997]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:46:02.997 --> 00:46:07.201]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:13.907]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:46:13.907 --> 00:46:17.671]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:46:18.371 --> 00:46:37.894]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:46:38.434 --> 00:46:42.537]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:46:42.537 --> 00:46:53.785]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:46:53.785 --> 00:47:03.232]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:47:03.232 --> 00:47:05.854]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:26.062]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.925 --> 00:47:35.909]  Out here in the fields, just a regular guy, fighting for my family, for your family.
[00:47:35.909 --> 00:47:44.196]  Knowing we have unlimited resources with the technology we have now, we've got to work together in a culture based on competition and shared human values.
[00:47:44.196 --> 00:47:48.760]  The globalists are just like Hitler, they're just like Stalin, they're like all these power-mad people.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.702]  They want total control and domination.
[00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:54.124]  And they're trying to dominate Russia using radical Islam.
[00:47:54.124 --> 00:47:54.705]  It's incredible.
[00:47:55.345 --> 00:47:59.588]  Andrei Afanesyev is our guest here for this segment and the next.
[00:47:59.588 --> 00:48:01.650]  This story just broke.
[00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:04.552]  Pompeo, director of the CIA, is testifying right now.
[00:48:04.552 --> 00:48:13.459]  I think he's done a lot of good things at the CIA, but I'll be honest with you, he's a nationalist, was a nationalist congressman, part of the Freedom Caucus.
[00:48:13.459 --> 00:48:14.700]  But listen to this quote.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.803]  We've already killed hundreds of Russians in Syria.
[00:48:18.803 --> 00:48:20.144]  Kit Daniels reports on that.
[00:48:21.713 --> 00:48:37.070]  So, yes, they've already bombed repeatedly and blown up airfields and other facilities full of Russians, who we invited in, right along with Assad, five years ago when our military said, yes, it's wrong to back Al Qaeda, and Congress wouldn't fund the Al Qaeda takeover.
[00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.333]  So the media changed the name to ISIS.
[00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:41.095]  It's the same group.
[00:48:41.095 --> 00:48:41.615]  And so now,
[00:48:42.776 --> 00:48:45.179]  You've caught the rebels chemical attacking over and over again.
[00:48:45.179 --> 00:48:53.849]  This fourth time the Russian ambassador comes out and says, and I'll play a clip in a moment where he also said it on Eurovision television, and there's a blackout!
[00:48:53.849 --> 00:49:01.498]  You'd think the Russian government at the UN saying, we didn't do this, this has been staged before, would be newsworthy.
[00:49:01.498 --> 00:49:02.198]  But last year,
[00:49:03.533 --> 00:49:18.779]  Via Mike Cernovich, we got internal Google documents on a multi-million dollar contract where Google was paying to have InfoWars delisted as fake news, but covertly having contractors go out and delist it outside their algorithm to keep the algorithm still operating correctly.
[00:49:18.779 --> 00:49:22.801]  They don't just delist it themselves, they hire others to do it so they can testify they've never done it.
[00:49:22.801 --> 00:49:23.941]  You can read the documents.
[00:49:23.941 --> 00:49:25.382]  Google said, oh, that was a mistake.
[00:49:26.821 --> 00:49:27.621]  That was an accident.
[00:49:27.621 --> 00:49:29.002]  We're not going to delist Alex Jones.
[00:49:29.002 --> 00:49:29.982]  What was the fake news?
[00:49:29.982 --> 00:49:30.842]  Their reason?
[00:49:30.842 --> 00:49:34.404]  That the rebels ever got caught staging chemical attacks.
[00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:38.685]  That was all over the news four years ago, the first time they got caught.
[00:49:38.685 --> 00:49:41.926]  But after that, the media got so controlled the other two times.
[00:49:41.926 --> 00:49:43.687]  Now there's this fourth time, we believe.
[00:49:43.687 --> 00:49:46.848]  We don't know yet, but it looks like it.
[00:49:46.848 --> 00:49:51.370]  Why would Assad do this right as he's winning and everybody's pulling out, when it's the red line?
[00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:53.010]  And right when Trump says he's pulling out.
[00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.271]  This is clearly the deep state.
[00:49:55.765 --> 00:49:56.986]  It's unbelievable.
[00:49:56.986 --> 00:50:00.907]  And you know, now folks are saying assassinate Assad when he westernized, opened things up.
[00:50:00.907 --> 00:50:02.248]  His dad was a bad guy.
[00:50:02.248 --> 00:50:04.829]  I'm not saying he's a good guy, but it's his country.
[00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:07.530]  The Middle East is full of dictators.
[00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:11.512]  But Pompeo were already killed hundreds of Russians in Syria.
[00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:13.313]  Let's play the clip of the Russian ambassador.
[00:50:13.313 --> 00:50:15.674]  We'll go back to our guest.
[00:50:15.674 --> 00:50:20.336]  Not at the UN, but we have the Russian ambassador on television.
[00:50:20.336 --> 00:50:21.176]  Again, this is in Europe.
[00:50:22.506 --> 00:50:28.411]  Talking about it, and we also have former UK Ambassador Peter Ford sharing the evidence points towards it being staged.
[00:50:28.411 --> 00:50:33.975]  But first, here is the Russian Ambassador to the EU claims there was no chemical attack in Doma.
[00:50:33.975 --> 00:50:34.296]  Here it is.
[00:50:38.724 --> 00:50:52.370]  Russia, let me correct you, is also shocked by yet another provocation of this so-called chemical attack in Douma, eastern Ghouta, near Damascus.
[00:50:55.451 --> 00:51:11.522]  Russian military specialists have visited the region, walked on those streets, entered those houses, talked to local doctors, and visited the only functioning hospital in Zuma, including its basement, where reportedly the mountains of corpses pile up.
[00:51:11.522 --> 00:51:16.005]  There wasn't a single corpse, and not a single person who came in for treatment after the attack.
[00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:21.234]  But we've seen them on the video.
[00:51:21.234 --> 00:51:24.958]  There was no chemical attack in Douma, pure and simple.
[00:51:24.958 --> 00:51:26.059]  And what did we see?
[00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:41.731]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.305 --> 00:52:03.306]  In response to something that didn't happen?
[00:52:03.306 --> 00:52:13.289]  Still, is Russia prepared for an event like a strike that could eventually lead to Russians being hurt or even killed?
[00:52:13.289 --> 00:52:24.834]  Russia has warned US representatives, publicly as well as through the proper channels, over the grave consequences that could arise if these strikes happen, and whether, deliberately or otherwise, Russian citizens are hurt.
[00:52:35.401 --> 00:52:36.742]  That's Euronews.
[00:52:36.742 --> 00:52:38.363]  The full interview is up on Infowars.com.
[00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:40.404]  That's the Russian ambassador to the EU.
[00:52:40.404 --> 00:52:44.227]  I just played the Russian ambassador to the UN earlier saying basically the exact same thing.
[00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:46.008]  But I don't just go off what the Russians say.
[00:52:46.008 --> 00:52:47.789]  I'm not a Russophile.
[00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:48.790]  I'm not an Anglophile.
[00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.471]  I'm an Americana guy.
[00:52:51.906 --> 00:52:53.907]  But I see Russia going in the direction of 1776.
[00:52:53.907 --> 00:52:56.648]  I see us going in the opposite direction.
[00:52:56.648 --> 00:53:03.212]  I see the very enemies of our country trying to start a war by killing a bunch of Russians, and the Russians say they're going to shoot back at our ships!
[00:53:04.825 --> 00:53:12.970]  So let's talk with Andrei Afanesyev, a national TV host, analyst, runs his own TV network in Russia.
[00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.892]  Again, famous reporter over there.
[00:53:14.892 --> 00:53:16.953]  Advises a lot of folks.
[00:53:16.953 --> 00:53:19.595]  In the five minutes we have in this segment, the bad scenario.
[00:53:19.595 --> 00:53:27.359]  We don't want to be alarmist, but if we're not, and talk about where this leads, nuclear war, if the Russians, if a bunch of them get killed,
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.965]  Then, under international law, the Russians have a response to shoot down more of our aircraft to sink ships.
[00:53:32.965 --> 00:53:34.947]  Then, things escalate very, very quickly.
[00:53:34.947 --> 00:53:36.269]  This is insane!
[00:53:36.269 --> 00:53:44.778]  A guy with a brain tumor, who's completely psychotic, John McCain, who's well-known for being a psychotic, just, let's pull some photos of McCain lately.
[00:53:44.778 --> 00:53:45.980]  He just looks completely deranged.
[00:53:47.375 --> 00:53:51.996]  This guy's undergoing chemotherapy, which makes you even more unstable, especially when it's in the brain.
[00:53:51.996 --> 00:53:54.097]  They call it chemo-brain.
[00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:58.758]  This guy is the guy that helped fund the radical jihadists that helped invade the whole area.
[00:53:58.758 --> 00:54:02.138]  Went over there with Marco Rubio and the rest of them, and Lindsey Graham.
[00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:05.039]  There they are with the ISIS and Al-Qaeda leaders.
[00:54:05.039 --> 00:54:10.000]  Let's talk worst-case scenario this thing kicks off.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.901]  Well, Alex, you know, I'll be really personal now.
[00:54:14.844 --> 00:54:17.886]  And are really sincere, so to say.
[00:54:17.886 --> 00:54:22.468]  I'm really pissed off by these people who are warmongers.
[00:54:22.468 --> 00:54:26.290]  Because warmongers are not going to fight themselves.
[00:54:27.469 --> 00:54:34.390]  McCain is not going to take an M16 rifle and fight me somewhere in the deserts of Syria.
[00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:46.953]  He's gonna send some folks from Texas, from Arizona, from New Mexico, from Idaho, and send them to death and make us kill each other.
[00:54:46.953 --> 00:54:53.114]  These warmongers are not telling, I will leave you to fight the Russians because I think that they are not right.
[00:54:53.743 --> 00:55:00.887]  They tell you that go and die for me because I think that Russians have crossed my way, crossed my road.
[00:55:00.887 --> 00:55:03.609]  And this is really disturbing and terrible.
[00:55:03.609 --> 00:55:10.333]  And, you know, there are some situations where war is inevitable.
[00:55:10.333 --> 00:55:12.995]  We are not in this kind of situation.
[00:55:12.995 --> 00:55:15.056]  Russian US have a lot of
[00:55:15.728 --> 00:55:20.690]  We have a lot of problems, we have a lot of controversies, we have a lot of things we do not agree on.
[00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:25.492]  But we don't have a single real reason for a major war.
[00:55:25.492 --> 00:55:27.032]  And we must understand this.
[00:55:27.032 --> 00:55:31.054]  And I want to be clear with your audience, who I really respect.
[00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:33.872]  We don't want to fight with you.
[00:55:33.872 --> 00:55:38.836]  We don't want to fight the real Americans that will be sent in case of war.
[00:55:38.836 --> 00:55:42.459]  Ordinary Americans will be sent to fight for the interests of globalists.
[00:55:42.459 --> 00:55:46.563]  And globalists will be somewhere in the bunkers or on the islands or wherever.
[00:55:46.563 --> 00:55:47.764]  Safe.
[00:55:47.764 --> 00:55:49.025]  We are gonna die.
[00:55:49.025 --> 00:55:50.226]  Us and you.
[00:55:50.226 --> 00:55:51.867]  And they will live.
[00:55:51.867 --> 00:55:53.569]  And I think that it's not right.
[00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:56.351]  If you are a World War monger, go to Syria.
[00:55:56.351 --> 00:55:57.132]  Mr. McCain.
[00:55:57.899 --> 00:56:05.529]  I wish you to recover from the illness, grab a rifle, and go and fight in Syria with someone.
[00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:06.951]  That's the only answer.
[00:56:06.951 --> 00:56:13.540]  And all the other warmongers on CNN, on BBC or wherever, go grab a gun,
[00:56:14.264 --> 00:56:18.887]  And risk your life and fight for ideals you believe in.
[00:56:18.887 --> 00:56:21.429]  I don't tell with the right or wrong.
[00:56:21.429 --> 00:56:24.191]  If you're ready to kill for it, go forward and do this.
[00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:29.134]  Meet our spetsnaz, meet our special forces, meet our soldiers, and try to kill them.
[00:56:29.134 --> 00:56:29.615]  We'll see that.
[00:56:30.862 --> 00:56:37.945]  We're going to go to break and come back and talk about ways out of this like we had five years ago when our own military, our own people said we'll not fight for Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:37.945 --> 00:56:38.845]  Then how they rebranded.
[00:56:38.845 --> 00:56:40.786]  We'll be right back with our guest on the other side.
[00:56:40.786 --> 00:56:46.089]  Then Nigel Farage joins us about six minutes into the next hour from the UK with his analysis of this.
[00:56:46.989 --> 00:56:52.053]  Before we go any further, everybody knows that we have the purest, deep-earth, crystal-source form of iodine.
[00:56:52.053 --> 00:56:53.134]  It's just pure iodine.
[00:56:53.134 --> 00:56:54.255]  Our enemies have tested it in the news.
[00:56:54.255 --> 00:56:54.955]  They go, it's weird.
[00:56:54.955 --> 00:56:56.717]  It's not sodium iodine.
[00:56:56.717 --> 00:56:57.958]  It's not this iodine.
[00:56:57.958 --> 00:56:59.319]  It's pure iodine.
[00:56:59.319 --> 00:57:00.239]  Yeah, that's the whole point.
[00:57:00.239 --> 00:57:02.041]  It is pure 999999 iodine.
[00:57:02.041 --> 00:57:04.283]  It's very hard to get it.
[00:57:04.283 --> 00:57:07.225]  If you get it from the oil companies when they drill, it's a side derivative.
[00:57:07.225 --> 00:57:08.286]  It's very hard to get.
[00:57:08.286 --> 00:57:11.869]  For the second time in the five-year history of this, we're not even sure we can get any more of it.
[00:57:11.869 --> 00:57:14.731]  We're working on a different type of iodine, quite frankly, because this is getting more and more
[00:57:15.171 --> 00:57:16.332]  Expensive.
[00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:18.453]  I don't know if it'll be as good as this.
[00:57:18.453 --> 00:57:19.814]  This is the best out there.
[00:57:19.814 --> 00:57:21.535]  I think we'll probably get more.
[00:57:21.535 --> 00:57:24.757]  We've got enough for a couple more batches, but it'll be a while until more comes in.
[00:57:24.757 --> 00:57:25.798]  It's about to sell out.
[00:57:25.798 --> 00:57:26.738]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:57:26.738 --> 00:57:28.299]  It's just good for your body, period.
[00:57:28.299 --> 00:57:29.420]  It's the good halogen.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:30.641]  Look into all the great benefits.
[00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:31.561]  Find out for yourself.
[00:57:31.561 --> 00:57:33.102]  Consult your physician before you use it.
[00:57:33.102 --> 00:57:34.043]  It's powerful.
[00:57:34.043 --> 00:57:37.505]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:37.505 --> 00:57:42.328]  Get your Survival Shield X2, and you can guarantee you'll get it, and support the InfoWar.
[00:57:42.668 --> 00:57:44.169]  We'll be back with our number twos.
[00:57:44.169 --> 00:57:49.471]  Please spread the live links.
[00:57:49.471 --> 00:57:55.773]  Info Wars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[00:57:55.773 --> 00:58:04.176]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[00:58:04.176 --> 00:58:08.878]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup
[00:58:09.238 --> 00:58:12.979]  We only have 150% and then it helps fund our operation.
[00:58:12.979 --> 00:58:15.800]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:24.222]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[00:58:24.222 --> 00:58:26.042]  BrainForce takes about 30 minutes.
[00:58:26.042 --> 00:58:27.542]  But the two go together.
[00:58:27.542 --> 00:58:29.583]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[00:58:29.583 --> 00:58:38.725]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoHorseLife.com.
[00:58:39.065 --> 00:58:44.254]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.

[00:59:12.344 --> 00:59:14.765]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[00:59:14.765 --> 00:59:18.148]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.

[00:59:42.188 --> 00:59:44.328]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:59:44.328 --> 00:59:53.270]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:53.270 --> 01:00:06.353]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:10.754]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:29.722]  Andrei Asanasiev is our guest for another five minutes, and Nigel Farage is joining us.
[01:00:29.722 --> 01:00:41.025]  I want to talk about a positive way out of this, but first for TV viewers and radio listeners, the sound of cruise missiles launching last year, what, 40 plus of them, blowing up an airfield with no evidence that the Russians launched the chemical attack.
[01:00:42.793 --> 01:00:43.393]  The U.S.
[01:00:43.393 --> 01:00:53.398]  argument is, and the argument that we could be getting is, well Assad said he'd give up his chemicals and there were some chemical boxes at the airport.
[01:00:53.398 --> 01:00:55.079]  Well then why in Hades would the U.S.
[01:00:55.079 --> 01:00:57.180]  bomb open-air chemicals?
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:01.642]  And there was a town about a quarter mile away, it would have killed those people.
[01:01:01.642 --> 01:01:07.885]  Yeah, you blow up hundreds of tons of chemical weapons, it kills people.
[01:01:07.885 --> 01:01:09.886]  Chemical weapons detectors 50 miles away would pick them up.
[01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:14.169]  So, what happens if... That was one target!
[01:01:15.031 --> 01:01:15.871]  What was it, 40 plus?
[01:01:15.871 --> 01:01:17.132]  I remember Tomahawks got launched.
[01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:17.792]  Memory serves.
[01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:18.912]  Let's look it up.
[01:01:18.912 --> 01:01:20.293]  It may have been less or more.
[01:01:20.293 --> 01:01:21.513]  Memory says 40 Tomahawks.
[01:01:21.513 --> 01:01:22.773]  Let's see how good my memory is.
[01:01:22.773 --> 01:01:25.014]  I think 47 or something was the number?
[01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:29.195]  Let's do an Alex Jones factoid memory test.
[01:01:29.195 --> 01:01:31.296]  But let me ask our guests the time we have left.
[01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:36.637]  If they're going to hit 70 targets, we're talking about thousands of missiles potentially, or at least hundreds.
[01:01:36.637 --> 01:01:37.878]  What happens if that happens?
[01:01:37.878 --> 01:01:40.839]  We already talked about it in the worst case.
[01:01:40.839 --> 01:01:41.839]  What is the way out of this?
[01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:56.818]  Well, there is no clear way out of situation in case the missiles will be launched toward the Russian infrastructure and Russian military servicemen will have to defend ourselves.
[01:01:56.818 --> 01:02:12.109]  And we have the most modern and effective anti-missile systems, the S-400, that actually one of which is able to down 32 targets at once.
[01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.249]  So
[01:02:13.064 --> 01:02:14.685]  That's the main point.
[01:02:14.685 --> 01:02:18.348]  And the way out of this is just rationality.
[01:02:18.348 --> 01:02:24.912]  I'm pretty sure that now, in the White House, and in Washington, there is a strong fight.
[01:02:24.912 --> 01:02:34.778]  And I'm hoping that the side of sanity, the side of rationality, will win over warmongers and globalists.
[01:02:36.138 --> 01:03:01.177]  What we saw in the recent Trump's tweets, and we're now in a situation where the history of humanity is written in Twitter, and what we see is that Trump is saying that by now there is no clear plan to fire, to shoot missiles on Syrian territory, especially in near future.
[01:03:02.236 --> 01:03:07.403]  And, well, Trump somehow said that the U.S.
[01:03:07.403 --> 01:03:09.986]  did the main job in killing ISIS.
[01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:13.831]  Well, okay, probably Russia is ready to share some.
[01:03:14.634 --> 01:03:31.139]  Some glory with our American friends, but first, but first, we must understand that there should be no war, and there should be understanding that Syria is a sovereign state, and everyone should respect the right of any people and any nation.
[01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:33.900]  Sure, we have no business, especially when Hillary and Obama started it.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:41.422]  Well, Andre, in closing, I read what Trump said, and I'm glad he's saying, hey, I never said I'd hit him or win, and Mattis is starting to back down on this.
[01:03:42.342 --> 01:03:47.946]  How did they suddenly get to Trump to say, Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.
[01:03:47.946 --> 01:03:51.328]  Get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and smart.
[01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:55.251]  You shouldn't be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it.
[01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:58.473]  The US has been caught with the rebels that have been caught doing it.
[01:03:58.473 --> 01:04:01.735]  Now I don't say Trump or all of America but the globalist deep state.
[01:04:01.735 --> 01:04:07.359]  So this is pure projection and it's just, it's the first thing Trump's done that's like a punch in the stomach.
[01:04:09.147 --> 01:04:12.229]  Well, maybe someone stole his iPhone.
[01:04:12.229 --> 01:04:12.669]  I don't know.
[01:04:12.669 --> 01:04:13.310]  Yeah.
[01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:14.591]  So they're the only answer.
[01:04:14.591 --> 01:04:21.215]  Sometimes I feel like someone is stealing the phone of Trump and texting some terrible stuff.
[01:04:21.215 --> 01:04:32.363]  I hope that this is some kind of a very complex, complicated game we cannot understand just without clear and enough information.
[01:04:32.363 --> 01:04:33.743]  Well, you know we did that on DACA.
[01:04:33.743 --> 01:04:35.164]  We did it on the DACA and the guns.
[01:04:35.164 --> 01:04:36.946]  And I know for a fact he does that.
[01:04:36.946 --> 01:04:38.727]  But you can't do that with nuclear war in Russia.
[01:04:39.808 --> 01:04:42.029]  You can't play those games with nuclear weapons.
[01:04:42.029 --> 01:04:43.891]  Thank you so much, Andre.
[01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:44.691]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:44.691 --> 01:04:45.932]  It was 59 tomahawks.
[01:04:45.932 --> 01:04:46.813]  I said 47, 48.
[01:04:46.813 --> 01:04:48.054]  My memory was more than I thought.
[01:04:48.054 --> 01:04:50.075]  59 for one target.
[01:04:50.075 --> 01:04:51.896]  How many will be 70 targets?
[01:04:51.896 --> 01:04:52.517]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:52.517 --> 01:04:54.578]  We'll be back with Nigel Farage and more.
[01:04:54.578 --> 01:04:54.999]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.507 --> 01:05:04.073]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in full war's life.
[01:05:04.073 --> 01:05:04.954]  It'd take hours.
[01:05:04.954 --> 01:05:07.396]  Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:05:07.396 --> 01:05:08.578]  It's stronger.
[01:05:08.578 --> 01:05:10.179]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:05:10.179 --> 01:05:13.403]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:05:13.403 --> 01:05:14.524]  It's back in stock.
[01:05:14.524 --> 01:05:17.707]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:05:17.707 --> 01:05:21.031]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:21.691]  It's
[01:05:40.194 --> 01:05:42.195]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[01:05:42.195 --> 01:05:43.576]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:05:43.576 --> 01:05:53.483]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:05:53.483 --> 01:06:02.850]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:06.793]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:13.323]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:20.931 --> 01:06:30.221]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.221 --> 01:06:32.824]  Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[01:06:32.824 --> 01:06:35.847]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[01:06:35.847 --> 01:06:41.993]  I'm not going to go over his whole background because that would take the 10 minutes we have, but he's helped lead the populist movement.
[01:06:42.714 --> 01:06:45.857]  Not just in the UK and Brexit, but in Europe now.
[01:06:45.857 --> 01:06:52.602]  We have Viktor Orban with a huge landslide victory against Soros, has reported 50 million plus dollars put in.
[01:06:52.602 --> 01:06:56.765]  We see nationalism spreading, free market nationalism all over the world.
[01:06:56.765 --> 01:06:58.527]  And so a true modern...
[01:06:59.387 --> 01:06:59.707]  I don't
[01:07:19.115 --> 01:07:23.839]  Now Mattis has come out, Secretary of Defense today, and said there's no evidence the Russians did this.
[01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:25.360]  So, wow!
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.963]  And we're talking about potentially a wider war, a new world war, many analysts say.
[01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:35.427]  Nigel Farage, I know you've been speaking to this in your syndicated radio and TV program.
[01:07:35.427 --> 01:07:36.648]  What is the latest from the UK?
[01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:47.239]  Well, remember that in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[01:07:47.239 --> 01:07:51.640]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.462]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[01:07:54.462 --> 01:07:56.402]  It would have been mad!
[01:07:56.402 --> 01:08:04.125]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:07.507]  So, I'm a great believer actually, with all these things, trust
[01:08:08.147 --> 01:08:14.830]  Middle England, Trust, Middle America, they tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:19.293]  Now, Mrs. May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[01:08:19.293 --> 01:08:29.558]  All I can tell her is be careful because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[01:08:29.558 --> 01:08:32.359]  And there's one bit of good news, Alex.
[01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:36.401]  I think the President's tweets and Mattis's comments today
[01:08:37.151 --> 01:08:43.056]  I think they've kind of rethought the stuff that was being said in DC yesterday morning.
[01:08:43.056 --> 01:08:44.297]  They're taking a break.
[01:08:44.297 --> 01:08:45.618]  They're having a pause.
[01:08:45.618 --> 01:08:47.279]  And you know something?
[01:08:47.279 --> 01:09:01.250]  Even if, even if you prove to me conclusively that Assad had ordered that chemical attack on those civilians, which I kind of doubt because he's winning anyway, but that's by the by.
[01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.992]  Even if you prove that to me, what good
[01:09:04.577 --> 01:09:16.012]  Would massive military strikes that could possibly topple him from the leadership give us a massive vacuum and let ISIS, who've just been beaten on the battlefield, back in?
[01:09:16.012 --> 01:09:18.696]  There is no argument, Alex, here for intervention.
[01:09:19.597 --> 01:09:44.726]  What do you make of the Russian ambassador to the EU and the Russian ambassador to the UN saying the same rebels have been caught three times, even the UN says that, staging these provocations, and that elements of the deep state in the US, and I know that Trump's been fighting with the generals, some of them are on the side, some aren't, who are actually trying to reconstitute ISIS under a new name, and the Russians are saying, we wouldn't do this, we're pulling out, and they're pointing the finger towards the rebels saying they staged a false flag.
[01:09:46.055 --> 01:09:50.658]  Well, you know, I'd no idea, you know, but let's put it like this.
[01:09:50.658 --> 01:10:05.807]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally, don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago were on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[01:10:05.807 --> 01:10:07.968]  ISIS could quite easily have done this
[01:10:08.488 --> 01:10:18.660]  Hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.263]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:24.186]  And look, come on, the biggest decision
[01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:34.801]  Government ever makes is to get involved in an act of war and you should not do it unless you've got a long-term strategy.
[01:10:34.801 --> 01:10:45.509]  Where Iraq went wrong and where Libya went wrong is we were short-term trying to get rid of leaders we didn't like without any thought for what came afterwards.
[01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:48.572]  We must not, not, not make that same mistake again.
[01:10:48.752 --> 01:10:53.094]  Well that's another thing with the Iraq war that I know that you were against the second one.
[01:10:53.094 --> 01:10:54.135]  I know Trump was against it.
[01:10:54.135 --> 01:10:58.617]  That's on record as real libertarians, as real nationalists.
[01:10:58.617 --> 01:11:01.658]  The neocons and others didn't think about what happens when you kick Saddam out.
[01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:03.359]  You get something even worse.
[01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:13.464]  Let's not forget it was the CIA that put Saddam in and then you were moving or we removed our allies in Egypt and then something 50 times worse got in.
[01:11:13.464 --> 01:11:15.985]  I mean it's just absurd to never think about
[01:11:16.525 --> 01:11:19.113]  The second and third and fourth moves that are going to happen.
[01:11:19.113 --> 01:11:24.008]  What's wrong with these elements both in the left and right that just love war?
[01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:29.504]  Yeah, it's become the new, uh, the new, let's show our people how strong we are.
[01:11:29.504 --> 01:11:35.266]  Let's distract their attention away from them to the extent to which we're removing their liberties and their freedoms.
[01:11:35.266 --> 01:11:37.066]  Let's show them what strong leaders are.
[01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:37.927]  Let's go to war.
[01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:39.347]  And we keep going to war.
[01:11:39.347 --> 01:11:40.828]  We keep getting it wrong.
[01:11:40.828 --> 01:11:43.629]  And Alex, you forgot to mention Libya a moment ago.
[01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:45.169]  You know, we got rid of Gaddafi.
[01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.730]  All right.
[01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:50.591]  You know, I wouldn't want to take Gaddafi home to meet my mum for tea.
[01:11:50.591 --> 01:11:55.053]  But the fact is, with Gaddafi gone, ISIS is back.
[01:11:55.771 --> 01:12:00.735]  The flow of migrants across the Mediterranean have chiefly been coming from Libya.
[01:12:00.735 --> 01:12:06.138]  And did you know, Alex, there are now open slave markets back in Libya.
[01:12:06.138 --> 01:12:07.559]  Haven't we done well?
[01:12:07.559 --> 01:12:12.063]  So given this dreadful record of failure, let's just think, please.
[01:12:12.063 --> 01:12:14.704]  Wow, it's just amazing.
[01:12:14.704 --> 01:12:24.691]  Hillary came, she saw Qaddafi died, and now we've got millions of people pouring across into Spain, into Italy, and the EU Navy they want to form wants to stop Italy and Spain
[01:12:25.672 --> 01:12:28.013]  From stopping these, you know, people from coming in.
[01:12:28.013 --> 01:12:32.295]  I mean, this is just completely insane, completely absurd.
[01:12:32.295 --> 01:12:33.555]  And you've talked about that.
[01:12:33.555 --> 01:12:40.658]  The bigger EU plan to collapse the Middle East and North Africa and flood Europe with Islamists or bonds victory stands against that.
[01:12:40.658 --> 01:12:41.839]  You're a leading expert on this.
[01:12:41.839 --> 01:12:43.980]  Why is the left ally with radical Islam?
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.940]  Why are they trying to flood?
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:47.081]  Because they hate Christianity.
[01:12:47.751 --> 01:12:58.775]  They can't, I mean, you know, they deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:00.035]  They deny that.
[01:13:00.035 --> 01:13:03.756]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[01:13:03.756 --> 01:13:05.437]  They want to get rid of it.
[01:13:05.437 --> 01:13:13.399]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[01:13:13.399 --> 01:13:15.460]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[01:13:16.187 --> 01:13:21.452]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[01:13:21.452 --> 01:13:27.758]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[01:13:27.758 --> 01:13:34.705]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come.
[01:13:34.705 --> 01:13:35.926]  What do you think they're going to do?
[01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:39.219]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:13:39.219 --> 01:13:54.194]  Nigel Farage is our guest here for just a few more minutes, and that's where I was going next, is Merkel famously on the stage with the Facebook head, Zuckerberg, saying, don't worry, we're going to censor anybody that criticizes the EU, the EU trying to pass laws, you've been part of the EU Parliament.
[01:13:54.494 --> 01:13:56.535]  That's just ceremonial.
[01:13:56.535 --> 01:13:57.596]  You've witnessed that.
[01:13:57.596 --> 01:14:02.579]  Now in the UK, they're arresting people that criticize Islam or say that there are two genders.
[01:14:02.579 --> 01:14:04.580]  They're trying to restrict free speech here.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:11.964]  Don't we need in Europe and the UK and the US to really get on the offense and demand that free speech be exercised and be protected?
[01:14:11.964 --> 01:14:14.666]  Because the left is trying to bully it out of existence.
[01:14:14.666 --> 01:14:17.588]  They filed 15 frivolous lawsuits on me now.
[01:14:17.588 --> 01:14:18.848]  Yeah, more came in today.
[01:14:18.848 --> 01:14:19.629]  The lawyers see it.
[01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:20.469]  They're total frauds.
[01:14:20.469 --> 01:14:21.170]  They're overturned.
[01:14:22.050 --> 01:14:30.555]  Yes, the liberals actually are very illiberal.
[01:14:30.555 --> 01:14:36.339]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticize with their rhetoric.
[01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:38.360]  And look, what's really happening here?
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.062]  Don't underestimate how massive the seismic
[01:14:42.162 --> 01:14:42.623]  We're good to go.
[01:14:59.764 --> 01:15:01.665]  This politically correct charge.
[01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:05.347]  This attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely.
[01:15:05.347 --> 01:15:08.929]  If we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[01:15:08.929 --> 01:15:10.950]  So, don't get down everybody.
[01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:12.131]  Don't get depressed.
[01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:14.632]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[01:15:15.475 --> 01:15:24.620]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came in privately, cheered him up and cheered up the troops, and you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.521]  You're amazing.
[01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.261]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:15:26.261 --> 01:15:27.662]  I know you're very busy.
[01:15:27.662 --> 01:15:31.584]  But that's as the EU has said, they'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[01:15:31.584 --> 01:15:35.006]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[01:15:35.006 --> 01:15:41.870]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia.
[01:15:42.726 --> 01:15:44.588]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[01:15:57.313 --> 01:15:58.034]  Face it.
[01:15:58.034 --> 01:16:00.916]  Today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever.

[01:19:18.836 --> 01:19:20.677]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[01:19:20.677 --> 01:19:21.817]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:19:21.817 --> 01:19:22.558]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.542]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[01:19:30.542 --> 01:19:34.965]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[01:19:34.965 --> 01:19:38.828]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the global threat of it.
[01:19:38.828 --> 01:19:42.690]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:45.872]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[01:19:45.872 --> 01:19:49.495]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[01:19:49.495 --> 01:19:52.096]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[01:19:52.096 --> 01:19:53.117]  It's amazing.
[01:19:53.117 --> 01:19:55.539]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:20:00.791 --> 01:20:09.160]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.481]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:10.481 --> 01:20:14.626]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:31.963 --> 01:20:38.449]  You know, I think Nigel Farage is the best spoken person I know.
[01:20:38.449 --> 01:20:43.173]  He is the best spoken person out there.
[01:20:43.173 --> 01:20:47.637]  And whoever Tyler Durden is over at Zero Hedge is just incredibly intelligent as well.
[01:20:47.637 --> 01:20:50.460]  And I'm not engaged in a butt-kissing operation here.
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:56.586]  It's just when you talk to somebody that is 100% on, and knows everything you know and more,
[01:20:57.930 --> 01:21:00.152]  I know they've tried to kill at least three times.
[01:21:00.152 --> 01:21:05.395]  The EU police say, you know, they've tried to kill Farage, confirmed repeatedly.
[01:21:05.395 --> 01:21:09.878]  His airplane crashed, almost killed a pilot, very suspicious, but that's a side issue.
[01:21:09.878 --> 01:21:17.523]  Where they confirmed it was taking the bolts off his car, the lug nuts, so when he gets up to 60 miles an hour, the wheels come off.
[01:21:17.523 --> 01:21:19.144]  That's happened a couple times, you name it.
[01:21:19.144 --> 01:21:25.449]  His wife got him to quasi-retire, back to a brokerage firm stuff where he was very successful, and
[01:21:27.412 --> 01:21:30.533]  They tried to steal Brexit, so he came back out of retirement.
[01:21:30.533 --> 01:21:35.635]  And you know, three times they've confirmed they tried to kill him, and there's other times they've tried to kill him as well.
[01:21:35.635 --> 01:21:39.076]  Three times in the news where police say, foul play.
[01:21:39.076 --> 01:21:42.658]  And so, I don't blame him wanting to retire.
[01:21:42.658 --> 01:21:44.178]  And it's not a thing of cowardice either.
[01:21:44.178 --> 01:21:55.663]  It's like, he started UKIP 25 years ago, and took it to, you know, dominance in the EU, but the European Union Parliament is elected, but ceremonial.
[01:21:56.533 --> 01:22:03.298]  The permanent bureaucracy runs everything with Junker, the grandson of the top Nazi.
[01:22:03.298 --> 01:22:10.043]  I mean, after Hitler, there was Junker's grandfather and his dad, who was an officer.
[01:22:10.043 --> 01:22:10.944]  And that's what's so weird.
[01:22:10.944 --> 01:22:20.471]  It's like Soros is an old Nazi, and then Junker runs the unelected EU and owns Luxembourg because the Nazis took it by force.
[01:22:20.471 --> 01:22:24.174]  And then I'm sitting there at the press conference Monday,
[01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:35.656]  In DC, about all these anti-free speech lawsuits filed against us, the likes of which our lawyers have never seen before, they're so unconstitutional and so ridiculous.
[01:22:35.656 --> 01:22:46.628]  And in come people for the American Way, Right Wing Watch, Media Matters, ThinkProgress,
[01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:52.825]  And all these anti-free speech groups, and I sit there and I go, you're funded by Soros.
[01:22:52.825 --> 01:22:54.206]  And they go, no we're not.
[01:22:54.206 --> 01:22:59.008]  And you go to the Federal Elections Commission right there.
[01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:00.928]  And it says it all right there.
[01:23:00.928 --> 01:23:03.389]  Number one funder, George Soros.
[01:23:03.389 --> 01:23:12.333]  And they're always these snarky pinheads, and it's just like, what are people funded by a Nazi collaborator
[01:23:13.664 --> 01:23:15.764]  Doing in my face.
[01:23:15.764 --> 01:23:17.345]  Is this a Twilight Zone episode?
[01:23:17.345 --> 01:23:35.969]  And then all these leftist law firms in New York and DC and Texas file lawsuits on us now on a weekly basis that are totally made up, but they put the defamation in the lawsuit.
[01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:36.249]  So.
[01:23:37.861 --> 01:23:39.282]  They can get away with it.
[01:23:39.282 --> 01:23:45.787]  So they're defaming me, trying to destroy me, trying to scare everybody off from Infowars, as if they don't understand.
[01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:53.172]  Everybody sees us being demonized and attacked every night on Comedy Central, every week by Stephen Colbert on national television, by all the other channels.
[01:23:53.172 --> 01:23:57.976]  You'll be in a random movie.
[01:23:57.976 --> 01:24:00.077]  And the child molester is named Alex Jones.
[01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:00.878]  Another movie.
[01:24:00.878 --> 01:24:03.500]  The guy that's kidnapped kids and got them in the basement, named Alex Jones.
[01:24:06.016 --> 01:24:27.109]  And Homeland, the character's based on Alex Jones, and he doesn't like black people, he's a terrorist, and they'll just have random movies out there where you're sitting there watching, you don't even know you're in the movie, and the guy goes, Alex Jones taught me to hate, bleep, bleep, bleep, I won't say it because they'll edit it, and that's why I don't like these different groups, and you're just like, oh my God, they are really scared of me.
[01:24:31.383 --> 01:24:37.048]  And all I'm saying is they think you're really dumb, but see, leftist and people are all about selling out.
[01:24:37.048 --> 01:24:40.972]  Psychological studies show it.
[01:24:40.972 --> 01:24:46.777]  What is it, six times more likely not to give a charity, nine times more likely to steal?
[01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:48.278]  Major liberal universities have done the studies.
[01:24:48.278 --> 01:24:51.301]  You can pull them up, type in liberals are more stingy, liberals steal more.
[01:24:51.301 --> 01:24:57.206]  Because they use virtue signal, they're not liberals, they're liars!
[01:24:57.206 --> 01:24:57.947]  And they think
[01:24:59.670 --> 01:25:09.674]  That when they attack me, and they think when they lie about me that I'm all about what people are saying about me, like they are, and I'm all about money, and they don't get it, it makes me fight harder, it makes me more focused.
[01:25:09.674 --> 01:25:11.155]  You can ask the crew around here.
[01:25:11.155 --> 01:25:13.936]  When I'm under attack, I'm like a laser beam.
[01:25:13.936 --> 01:25:16.237]  There's not a lot I don't miss.
[01:25:16.237 --> 01:25:20.859]  When I'm not really under a lot of attack, I kind of don't even want to do the show.
[01:25:20.859 --> 01:25:26.841]  They just don't get it, standing for something, having something inside yourself that doesn't care what everybody else says.
[01:25:26.841 --> 01:25:28.202]  It's called leadership.
[01:25:32.096 --> 01:25:34.097]  And I am a leader.
[01:25:34.097 --> 01:25:35.397]  And that's why they hate my guts.
[01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:41.519]  And I'm so honored that I'm not with all the cowardly, timid souls that crouched down and licked the hands that feed them.
[01:25:41.519 --> 01:25:47.461]  Let them forget that they were our brethren and our countrymen.
[01:25:47.461 --> 01:25:53.323]  Because I know not what course others may choose, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:25:53.323 --> 01:25:56.624]  You figure that out yet?
[01:25:56.624 --> 01:25:58.765]  It's Patrick Henry.
[01:25:58.765 --> 01:25:59.885]  The war has already begun!
[01:26:02.694 --> 01:26:05.455]  The globalists are already suppressing people all over the planet.
[01:26:05.455 --> 01:26:15.138]  They're incredibly evil!
[01:26:15.138 --> 01:26:25.101]  But thanks to people like Nigel Farage, and Ron Paul, and Donald Trump, we have a fighting chance.
[01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:30.623]  And you know, I know what happened with Trump.
[01:26:30.623 --> 01:26:31.543]  Kind of from sources.
[01:26:33.601 --> 01:26:36.363]  And by that, I know what he did on DACA, I know what he did on the Second Amendment.
[01:26:36.363 --> 01:26:47.489]  I was told, after the fact that I even figured it out, that people that had talked to him, because I haven't talked to him in a while, I was told exactly what would happen, and watch.
[01:26:47.489 --> 01:26:50.670]  Trump wants you to know that that's what's going on here.
[01:26:50.670 --> 01:27:00.276]  And you heard Ted Nugent on last week, and he said, well, you're not supposed to tip your hand, but I will.
[01:27:01.226 --> 01:27:05.427]  And that, you know, on the Second Amendment deal, he was never going to get rid of any of it.
[01:27:05.427 --> 01:27:08.268]  He wanted the Democrats to come out and say, OK, repeal it.
[01:27:08.268 --> 01:27:15.291]  And I sat there in Nugent's house when he told me Trump believes they're going to call for the repeal when he does this, just like they did on DACA.
[01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:17.991]  They called for no borders at all.
[01:27:17.991 --> 01:27:25.554]  And I asked Nugent off air, he told me who told him that, the congressman that talked to Trump and then another guy he talked to, and I'll leave it at that, very close to the president.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:35.525]  And then three weeks later, exactly what Nugent said happened.
[01:27:35.525 --> 01:27:44.552]  And so Trump had them all pressuring him and saying, you know, they're going to say you're a Russian agent if you don't bomb them and the proof's going to come out and you're going to get in trouble and blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:44.552 --> 01:27:49.396]  And Trump said, uh-uh, I'll go ahead and put out some of this rhetoric for you and watch.
[01:27:49.396 --> 01:27:51.498]  The American people are going to hate my guts.
[01:27:51.498 --> 01:27:52.618]  You're wrong about this.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:28:01.144]  So I'm gonna go ahead and do this so the Russians flip out and you see how close we are to all this so I don't have to strike them because they're gonna strike back and you know they didn't do it.
[01:28:01.144 --> 01:28:10.389]  You know the rebels that the globalists at McMaster are involved with are involved in it and McMaster and all of them kept saying we're gonna still take Assad out and Trump would say no you're not.
[01:28:10.389 --> 01:28:18.193]  That's the type of mutiny and the type of insanity and the type of garbage that's going on inside the government.
[01:28:18.193 --> 01:28:18.673]  I was told
[01:28:19.997 --> 01:28:21.799]  By folks in government while I was in D.C.
[01:28:21.799 --> 01:28:23.961]  High-level, mid-level, low-level.
[01:28:23.961 --> 01:28:29.846]  That there are still whole hiring freezes going on because the Democrats are all embedded and won't hire anybody.
[01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:33.249]  And won't do anything.
[01:28:33.249 --> 01:28:36.272]  It's just absolute tyranny going on.
[01:28:36.272 --> 01:28:39.935]  We come back, I'm gonna open the phones up, recap the World War III news.
[01:28:39.935 --> 01:28:43.078]  We're in the middle of the 34-hour special emergency broadcast.
[01:28:43.078 --> 01:28:44.760]  Stop World War with Russia.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:57.207]  We need you, whether you're listening on local radio, watching on TV, or watching on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it, to get these live feeds and spread them to everybody, like we did five years ago, to stop a strike on Syria that could end the world!
[01:28:57.207 --> 01:28:58.108]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.108 --> 01:29:00.530]  A big, burky water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:08.475]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:08.855]  I think.
[01:29:27.293 --> 01:29:28.034]  Face it.
[01:29:28.034 --> 01:29:30.896]  Today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever.
[01:29:30.896 --> 01:29:38.161]  From natural disasters to EMP attacks and hacking, the grid could be crippled for days, or even decades in the most dire scenarios.
[01:29:38.161 --> 01:29:43.285]  Visit QuantumHarvest.net to see our built-to-last EMP-protected solar power systems.

[01:29:58.484 --> 01:30:04.787]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[01:30:04.787 --> 01:30:13.190]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:30:13.190 --> 01:30:18.272]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:30:18.272 --> 01:30:19.033]  We only have 150%.
[01:30:19.033 --> 01:30:20.153]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[01:30:22.014 --> 01:30:24.837]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:33.244]  That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[01:30:33.244 --> 01:30:35.086]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[01:30:35.086 --> 01:30:36.587]  But the two go together.
[01:30:36.587 --> 01:30:38.609]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[01:30:38.609 --> 01:30:47.538]  They're both 50% off individually, or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoHorseLife.com.
[01:30:48.078 --> 01:30:53.281]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:58.283]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today.
[01:30:58.283 --> 01:31:02.986]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWarsLife.
[01:31:03.826 --> 01:31:04.747]  They take hours.
[01:31:04.747 --> 01:31:07.188]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:31:07.188 --> 01:31:08.369]  It's stronger.
[01:31:08.369 --> 01:31:09.970]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:13.193]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:31:13.193 --> 01:31:14.314]  It's back in stock.
[01:31:14.314 --> 01:31:17.496]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:31:17.496 --> 01:31:21.258]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:31:21.258 --> 01:31:24.381]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[01:31:24.381 --> 01:31:25.121]  So you can upload it.
[01:31:25.121 --> 01:31:31.586]  And our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Ionine Fortified Toothpaste is
[01:31:32.246 --> 01:31:36.648]  Super blue silver immune gargle, that's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[01:31:36.648 --> 01:31:41.990]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:43.371]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:31:43.371 --> 01:31:53.295]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:31:53.295 --> 01:31:56.356]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:31:57.774 --> 01:32:01.356]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:01.356 --> 01:32:03.137]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:32:03.137 --> 01:32:15.183]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:32:15.183 --> 01:32:20.586]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:32:20.966 --> 01:32:30.336]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:34.901]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:38.044 --> 01:32:39.765]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:39.765 --> 01:32:49.748]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:49.748 --> 01:32:52.388]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:32:52.388 --> 01:33:01.771]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:33:01.771 --> 01:33:04.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.212 --> 01:33:10.333]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:10.333 --> 01:33:12.216]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.106 --> 01:33:33.688]  All right, I intend to open the phones up right through into the next hour.
[01:33:33.688 --> 01:33:39.452]  Mark Faber, economist, historian, going to give us his view on the Russia situation, the economy, and the outlook, and more.
[01:33:39.452 --> 01:33:43.314]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:33:43.314 --> 01:33:44.555]  I would suggest you call in.
[01:33:44.555 --> 01:33:47.117]  I want to get your topics on the Russia situation.
[01:33:47.117 --> 01:33:53.761]  The neocons are crazy enough to want to strike 70 targets, more than 20 of them Russian, which will kill hundreds of Russians.
[01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:55.982]  You've got Pompeo testifying just hours ago.
[01:33:55.982 --> 01:33:58.084]  He's still testifying on Capitol Hill.
[01:33:59.452 --> 01:34:01.754]  That we've killed hundreds of Russians.
[01:34:01.754 --> 01:34:09.658]  The people we were working with to take out the ISIS and Al Qaeda forces that were 95% of the rebel forces according to our own Pentagon.
[01:34:09.658 --> 01:34:14.401]  So you've got the bureaucrats that want the war, that hate the Russians, and you've got our own military that understands what's going on.
[01:34:14.401 --> 01:34:18.424]  And he's worked with the Russians in Afghanistan when they helped us after 9-11.
[01:34:18.424 --> 01:34:21.226]  It is just crazy.
[01:34:21.226 --> 01:34:22.106]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:34:22.106 --> 01:34:23.207]  First-time callers, by the way.
[01:34:23.207 --> 01:34:26.028]  Let's give folks a chance, at least in this hour, for first-time callers.
[01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:28.232]  877-789-2539.
[01:34:28.232 --> 01:34:35.927]  Can you believe that there's been a media blackout on the Russian ambassador to the EU, the Russian ambassador...
[01:34:37.573 --> 01:34:48.821]  To the US, to the UN, saying that we have evidence that the Western-backed rebel staged the terror attack and that that's not in our news.
[01:34:48.821 --> 01:34:59.588]  Day one, our media accused them with no evidence and Secretary of Defense Mattis this morning said there is no evidence and they're still looking at it.
[01:34:59.588 --> 01:35:01.890]  That should be getting more coverage as well.
[01:35:01.890 --> 01:35:03.491]  This is just huge.
[01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:13.294]  You attack those Russian forces there in that proxy war that Obama and Hillary started, it could kick off a new world war.
[01:35:13.294 --> 01:35:16.917]  And that's what most analysts say.
[01:35:16.917 --> 01:35:18.258]  It's just incredible.
[01:35:18.258 --> 01:35:23.043]  I want to get some into Mueller before I go into your calls, too.
[01:35:23.043 --> 01:35:24.784]  There's been some big developments on that front.
[01:35:24.784 --> 01:35:27.787]  But just briefly, while we're getting your calls lined up.
[01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:41.056]  When I say I'm going to shell out of Boddy's Ultimate Turmeric Formula and it has a 95% curcumin in level and that no other companies out there that we've talked to can even get anything close to that, that's a fact.
[01:35:41.056 --> 01:35:43.419]  And it sold out in two weeks because we had a price so low.
[01:35:43.419 --> 01:35:47.483]  And people that know turmeric and its amazing properties bought it quickly.
[01:35:47.483 --> 01:35:48.504]  Well, it's come back in, it's 25% off.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:58.226]  I just can't offer it at 50 because that's so close to the price of what the product costs that we can't fund our operation and fight all these Soros operations, the rest of it.
[01:35:58.226 --> 01:36:05.832]  But if you'll just get the bodies and read about all the great benefits and attributes of it, you're going to help us defeat these people very, very easily.
[01:36:05.832 --> 01:36:10.636]  Because they know these are all frivolous lawsuits they filed, but it takes time to throw them out and defeat them.
[01:36:11.971 --> 01:36:15.874]  We had to set up a war room, got counsel, deal with it, you know, as it comes in.
[01:36:15.874 --> 01:36:17.135]  They're trying to shut down the First Amendment.
[01:36:17.135 --> 01:36:18.617]  This is diabolical.
[01:36:18.617 --> 01:36:22.980]  But if you stand against them and get great products that you and your family need, it's game over.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:29.786]  Take Icarin, kidney and liver cleanse, with all the known healthy compounds and concentrated herbs that help flush out your kidneys and liver.
[01:36:31.954 --> 01:36:34.035]  You know, you do it for your fuel injectors and stuff.
[01:36:34.035 --> 01:36:36.415]  Why not your carburetors?
[01:36:36.415 --> 01:36:37.916]  Why not do it for this?
[01:36:37.916 --> 01:36:39.376]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:39.376 --> 01:36:40.496]  Alpha Power.
[01:36:40.496 --> 01:36:48.619]  Sold out very quickly because it's got the known herbs and healthy compounds for libido, stamina, energy, particularly for men, but it works great for women as well.
[01:36:48.619 --> 01:36:52.580]  Vital Male Androgen Biosynthesis Promoter.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.441]  You've got the real red pill that goes great with that.
[01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:59.322]  You've got Brain Force that the media is always demonizing and attacking because they know it's such a popular formula.
[01:37:00.589 --> 01:37:04.230]  But the big one is X2.
[01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:06.411]  And by the way, Millie Weaver's got a report.
[01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:08.491]  I want them to retweet that out.
[01:37:08.491 --> 01:37:17.394]  She found, when she was in D.C., an old boxcar museum of, you know, dining cars.
[01:37:17.394 --> 01:37:19.234]  A Smithsonian.
[01:37:19.234 --> 01:37:19.934]  She's got the report.
[01:37:23.746 --> 01:37:25.647]  It says the benefits of iodine.
[01:37:25.647 --> 01:37:30.111]  Everyone knows the benefits of iodine in toothpaste from like 1910.
[01:37:30.111 --> 01:37:31.592]  And back then they put it in toothpaste.
[01:37:31.592 --> 01:37:34.253]  It was the good halogen, not fluoride.
[01:37:34.253 --> 01:37:36.695]  Then they took it out and put fluoride, the bad halogen, in.
[01:37:36.695 --> 01:37:37.936]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:37:37.936 --> 01:37:46.022]  We didn't just come up with super blue toothpaste with iodine and chloral silver in it because we just thought of it off the top of our head.
[01:37:46.022 --> 01:37:50.645]  We did research on how IQs were 15 points lower until they started doing that.
[01:37:50.645 --> 01:37:51.786]  And then they took it out again.
[01:37:51.786 --> 01:37:53.187]  And now the IQs are dropping again.
[01:37:54.551 --> 01:37:57.355]  But instead of having, yeah, there it is, iodine.
[01:37:57.355 --> 01:37:58.697]  And that company, by the way, is still around.
[01:37:58.697 --> 01:38:02.142]  They don't put iodine in it.
[01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:03.204]  There's all the ads for it.
[01:38:03.204 --> 01:38:07.970]  I mean, but again, you can just search engine.
[01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:08.732]  Google won't show it to you.
[01:38:08.732 --> 01:38:10.875]  You gotta go to Bing or somewhere else or start page.
[01:38:12.901 --> 01:38:17.546]  And you can go read huge, you know, articles, reports, you name it, about iodine.
[01:38:17.546 --> 01:38:20.529]  And this is the pure iodine that's not bound from deep earth crystals.
[01:38:20.529 --> 01:38:27.918]  And we have to get it from oil companies that hit it as they're going down and gas drilling just between 7 and 12,000 feet.
[01:38:27.918 --> 01:38:31.762]  It's very, very expensive for them to stop and then extract the crystals.
[01:38:31.762 --> 01:38:33.904]  We're the only people we know of, and I keep trying to find
[01:38:34.793 --> 01:38:39.916]  The group's great, he's a great guy, but it's so expensive for us that the markup's not very big and it's a bestseller.
[01:38:39.916 --> 01:38:43.419]  If we could just get it cheaper and sell it cheaper, we could do that.
[01:38:43.419 --> 01:38:48.762]  But instead, the price for us getting it is going up, because now we've made a big industry out of it, so they're trying to charge him more.
[01:38:48.762 --> 01:39:00.209]  Iodine awareness is coming back, and so I'm told that some big cosmetic companies are trying to block us and get this for themselves, so it's gonna be put in hair product.
[01:39:00.209 --> 01:39:02.411]  So, that's the price of being a trailblazer.
[01:39:04.184 --> 01:39:09.005]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:39:09.005 --> 01:39:14.787]  This is about to sell out at current sales rates in about a week and a half.
[01:39:14.787 --> 01:39:18.288]  So I'm gonna have to, in a couple days, get rid of the 25% off.
[01:39:18.288 --> 01:39:19.469]  It's already discounted massively, $29.95.
[01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:24.751]  Again, you can't go to the store and buy the iodine there and drink that.
[01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:26.932]  That'll leave a hole in your stomach because it's not real iodine.
[01:39:26.932 --> 01:39:29.572]  It's mixed with all these toxins and bound to things.
[01:39:29.572 --> 01:39:30.953]  This is pure.
[01:39:30.953 --> 01:39:35.895]  This is kept in a DEA lab because you can use the raw stuff for manufacturing things.
[01:39:35.895 --> 01:39:39.876]  It turns purple when you lay it down on the ground and turns into a gas.
[01:39:39.876 --> 01:39:42.897]  It's all proprietary how they do it.
[01:39:42.897 --> 01:39:44.898]  And it's harder and harder to get it.
[01:39:44.898 --> 01:39:47.438]  The price goes up on our next shipment.
[01:39:47.438 --> 01:39:48.419]  It's not group's fault.
[01:39:48.419 --> 01:39:50.720]  I've seen the contracts and it's harder for him to get it.
[01:39:54.499 --> 01:39:56.100]  And quite frankly, you know, Grip's a great guy.
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:56.881]  I don't lie to anybody.
[01:39:56.881 --> 01:40:01.425]  We've gone around trying to find it ourselves, and you just can't get it.
[01:40:01.425 --> 01:40:03.426]  And we're looking at another iodine formula.
[01:40:03.426 --> 01:40:08.470]  If this stops, I mean, we've gone that far.
[01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:10.312]  We're looking at a total iodine product.
[01:40:10.312 --> 01:40:13.815]  This is the original base iodine, but some people absorb things better.
[01:40:13.815 --> 01:40:18.439]  This is obviously the best, but some people can't even absorb the basic iodine.
[01:40:18.439 --> 01:40:18.719]  It's like 2%.
[01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:24.273]  So there's three different types of iodine, but broken up into three different types.
[01:40:24.273 --> 01:40:25.414]  It may be better for some people.
[01:40:25.414 --> 01:40:27.195]  We don't think so, I'll be honest with you.
[01:40:27.195 --> 01:40:28.596]  We're looking for a replacement right now.
[01:40:28.596 --> 01:40:32.959]  That's how far down the line we are on this.
[01:40:32.959 --> 01:40:40.925]  We had a very clean seaweed-based five years ago, and people got a hold of them and blocked them from us getting that as a political sabotage, as economic sabotage, as espionage.
[01:40:40.925 --> 01:40:45.348]  Economic espionage, the French word for financial war, is espionage.
[01:40:48.621 --> 01:40:51.343]  Industrial espionage trying to stop us.
[01:40:51.343 --> 01:40:58.248]  And so, we have this shipment, more will come in in June, they say, and then we don't know.
[01:40:58.248 --> 01:41:02.512]  So, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:02.512 --> 01:41:10.138]  This is, again, not that thing where people try to make things scarce or whatever, so they sell more of it.
[01:41:10.138 --> 01:41:12.700]  I mean, that is the fact, so it does sell more of it, which is a catch-22.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:15.422]  Yeah, we can find ourselves now, but what happens if we can't get it?
[01:41:16.573 --> 01:41:20.896]  So we're looking around, the group's looking around, we're working hard, the group's a great guy.
[01:41:20.896 --> 01:41:27.401]  Stuff like Icarin or bodies, we can keep getting that product, it's just to have it sourced and then organic and tested.
[01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:31.064]  Sometimes things get held up, that's why there's shortages there.
[01:41:31.064 --> 01:41:36.328]  We have a good clean cup of iodine in the toothpaste and all that, it's not this deep earth type, but it's listed there.
[01:41:36.328 --> 01:41:41.772]  It's also another type in the mouthwash, the immune gargle that my dad has developed, expanding the Super Blue product line.
[01:41:41.772 --> 01:41:44.154]  But I'm done plugging, the point is that
[01:41:45.546 --> 01:41:52.850]  This really is an original, amazing product, and it's very, very special, and they are after us.
[01:41:52.850 --> 01:42:03.037]  I mean, this is industrial, they're trying to block us, and I don't like to tell you about stuff that gets down to the line, but the price is gonna go up on it regardless.
[01:42:03.037 --> 01:42:06.239]  The new low price is gonna be higher because we're gonna have to pay more.
[01:42:06.239 --> 01:42:10.821]  And many of our products, again, on average, our products, 40%,
[01:42:13.146 --> 01:42:18.410]  Of the cost you see on the sticker is what it's costing us.
[01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:20.852]  I mean, nobody does that.
[01:42:20.852 --> 01:42:26.215]  The average person puts $5 in a product if it's high-end and sells it for $39.
[01:42:26.215 --> 01:42:30.058]  People aren't putting $15, $20 in a product and selling it for $40.
[01:42:30.058 --> 01:42:31.319]  That's what we do.
[01:42:31.319 --> 01:42:33.420]  The toothpaste has got a higher markup.
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:36.002]  It costs us $3 just in product and everything else.
[01:42:36.002 --> 01:42:37.583]  It's sold for $9.95.
[01:42:37.583 --> 01:42:41.266]  There's just not enough funding in it to sell it, you know, for 100% markup for $6.
[01:42:41.266 --> 01:42:41.886]  We can't do it.
[01:42:41.886 --> 01:42:42.507]  We go bankrupt.
[01:42:42.887 --> 01:42:43.768]  We need your support.
[01:42:43.768 --> 01:42:46.970]  Infowarslive.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:49.633]  And please support our local affiliates as well.
[01:42:49.633 --> 01:42:50.213]  That is critical.
[01:42:50.213 --> 01:42:51.234]  Become a sponsor.
[01:42:51.234 --> 01:42:54.777]  Or just tithe your local station who's standing up for free speech.
[01:42:54.777 --> 01:42:55.758]  That's religious freedom as well.
[01:42:57.222 --> 01:43:00.023]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[01:43:00.023 --> 01:43:10.488]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[01:43:10.488 --> 01:43:11.268]  Scalability.
[01:43:11.268 --> 01:43:13.009]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27.
[01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:15.671]  Instead of $39, 50% off.
[01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:20.514]  Because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient in MycoZx.
[01:43:20.514 --> 01:43:22.155]  Now it's the other side of the equation.
[01:43:22.155 --> 01:43:27.818]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[01:43:27.818 --> 01:43:30.981]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place.
[01:43:31.781 --> 01:43:34.862]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[01:43:34.862 --> 01:43:40.643]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[01:43:40.643 --> 01:43:47.065]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:43:47.065 --> 01:43:49.905]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[01:43:49.905 --> 01:43:55.427]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[01:43:57.122 --> 01:43:59.464]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:43:59.464 --> 01:44:01.625]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:44:01.625 --> 01:44:05.548]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:44:05.548 --> 01:44:17.057]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[01:44:17.057 --> 01:44:26.164]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[01:44:46.444 --> 01:44:48.465]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:44:48.465 --> 01:44:51.768]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:44:51.768 --> 01:44:54.290]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.

[01:44:57.955 --> 01:45:02.358]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:02.358 --> 01:45:10.464]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:45:10.464 --> 01:45:15.747]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:45:15.747 --> 01:45:18.269]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:45:18.269 --> 01:45:22.492]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:45:22.492 --> 01:45:24.934]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:45:25.816 --> 01:45:32.863]  Eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:45:32.863 --> 01:45:40.930]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:45:40.930 --> 01:45:48.117]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:45:48.117 --> 01:45:49.578]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:45:49.578 --> 01:45:51.400]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[01:45:57.823 --> 01:46:03.226]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:03.226 --> 01:46:06.068]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:46:06.068 --> 01:46:08.049]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:46:08.049 --> 01:46:13.071]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:46:13.071 --> 01:46:15.173]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:46:15.173 --> 01:46:16.453]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:21.376]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:46:21.556 --> 01:46:28.441]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:46:28.441 --> 01:46:35.126]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:46:35.126 --> 01:46:42.051]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:46:42.051 --> 01:46:47.915]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[01:46:48.095 --> 01:46:49.537]  Nano, silver and more.
[01:46:49.537 --> 01:47:01.253]  Learn more about InfoWarsLife Super Blue Toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:47:01.253 --> 01:47:03.917]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.387 --> 01:47:29.394]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:29.394 --> 01:47:31.635]  We're going to do a report on it.
[01:47:31.635 --> 01:47:35.918]  David Knight just ran in here, who does the morning show, does a great job from 8 a.m.
[01:47:35.918 --> 01:47:39.881]  to 11 a.m., and he just ran in here and he said, man, my wife just called me.
[01:47:39.881 --> 01:47:42.924]  She watches you and us on Facebook on the live streams there.
[01:47:44.246 --> 01:47:46.969]  Because it's a little bit better quality than our streams.
[01:47:46.969 --> 01:47:49.593]  And he said, you're hard limited to 200 viewers.
[01:47:51.889 --> 01:47:55.230]  Now let's go ahead and click on that so we can specifically show them the player.
[01:47:55.230 --> 01:47:56.890]  That is 222.
[01:47:56.890 --> 01:47:58.031]  You are hard-coded there.
[01:47:58.031 --> 01:48:03.492]  Now normally there's 10,000 just on that stream alone, and that's not a big part of our audience.
[01:48:03.492 --> 01:48:06.473]  It's the archives, it's the other live shows, the special events.
[01:48:06.473 --> 01:48:12.675]  Most people listen on their local radio station, or they watch on our streams, or listen to the audio streams, or they get the podcast later.
[01:48:12.675 --> 01:48:15.596]  And we're on four different streams on Facebook as well, but the main one
[01:48:19.631 --> 01:48:24.792]  That has millions and millions of likes.
[01:48:24.792 --> 01:48:29.033]  Has it limited down, depending on the browser, to a couple hundred people?
[01:48:29.033 --> 01:48:30.794]  Now, why does that matter?
[01:48:30.794 --> 01:48:37.715]  I was sitting there at the National Press Club on Monday.
[01:48:37.715 --> 01:48:43.356]  When I was not giving a speech, I was looking at Rob doing what we call the Warhammer.
[01:48:43.356 --> 01:48:44.897]  So it looks like a big Warhammer.
[01:48:44.897 --> 01:48:46.517]  Three phones on top of a tripod.
[01:48:47.867 --> 01:48:53.989]  YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook of a hugely promoted event.
[01:48:53.989 --> 01:49:01.131]  And guess how many people it said was watching on each one?
[01:49:01.131 --> 01:49:02.131]  603, 601, 602.
[01:49:02.131 --> 01:49:07.993]  And I almost shot video of it, but people were talking to me constantly.
[01:49:07.993 --> 01:49:09.233]  But that's what they do.
[01:49:09.233 --> 01:49:17.396]  If I go on some random person's Facebook show that normally has a few hundred listeners, it has hundreds of thousands by the time I leave, because they're able to actually share.
[01:49:18.419 --> 01:49:27.722]  Up until the election, when I did Facebook, I would have millions sometimes watching, but always hundreds of thousands.
[01:49:27.722 --> 01:49:30.063]  But then Facebook called and said, we want you to fly to New York.
[01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:32.464]  We want to meet with you.
[01:49:32.464 --> 01:49:35.005]  This is all off record, who they were, the specifics.
[01:49:35.005 --> 01:49:36.726]  And you'll be able to continue to reach millions.
[01:49:36.726 --> 01:49:37.526]  This is your audience.
[01:49:37.526 --> 01:49:39.767]  We're letting you reach your audience.
[01:49:39.767 --> 01:49:40.867]  But I didn't go meet with them.
[01:49:40.867 --> 01:49:42.208]  I didn't kiss Zuckerberg's butt.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:48.946]  And so, boom, I've been shadow banned to where you have to be on the page itself.
[01:49:48.946 --> 01:49:50.728]  But now that's not enough.
[01:49:50.728 --> 01:49:56.874]  I'm flooded with emails, text, comments on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube that it kicks me off.
[01:49:56.874 --> 01:49:58.976]  I'm allowed to watch everybody else but you.
[01:49:58.976 --> 01:50:00.017]  It kicks me off.
[01:50:00.017 --> 01:50:01.739]  I'm not allowed to watch you.
[01:50:01.739 --> 01:50:03.320]  It's just not playing.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.482]  What's going on?
[01:50:05.482 --> 01:50:06.203]  Well, it came out.
[01:50:06.203 --> 01:50:07.044]  Zuckerberg admits it.
[01:50:08.956 --> 01:50:10.297]  This is the censorship.
[01:50:10.297 --> 01:50:11.397]  This is their operations.
[01:50:11.397 --> 01:50:13.798]  This is how they're shadow banning conservatives.
[01:50:13.798 --> 01:50:15.499]  This is all behind the scenes.
[01:50:15.499 --> 01:50:18.040]  Project Veritas caught it on video.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:19.560]  And they don't let you share the video.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.961]  They don't let you share the articles or they unsubscribe you.
[01:50:21.961 --> 01:50:27.063]  You know, Mike Adams had hundreds of millions of views on his Health Ranger site.
[01:50:27.063 --> 01:50:28.884]  They took it down for a few months for no reason.
[01:50:28.884 --> 01:50:30.165]  They restored it over the weekend.
[01:50:30.165 --> 01:50:32.305]  But guess what?
[01:50:32.305 --> 01:50:35.227]  One third of his subscribers were gone.
[01:50:35.227 --> 01:50:36.487]  They unsubscribed.
[01:50:36.487 --> 01:50:36.907]  Same thing.
[01:50:36.907 --> 01:50:38.308]  We used to have two plus billion views.
[01:50:39.645 --> 01:50:41.667]  On our YouTube, our main YouTube channel.
[01:50:41.667 --> 01:50:49.012]  It now goes in reverse most of the time, down to a billion and a half, and thousands of the 33,000, 36,000, whatever it's up to videos, are just deleted!
[01:50:54.878 --> 01:50:57.240]  They just delete them constantly.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.822]  So listen, people say, well, do your own thing.
[01:50:59.822 --> 01:51:02.304]  We've got Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:51:02.304 --> 01:51:03.405]  We're on Threshold Radio.
[01:51:03.405 --> 01:51:04.346]  We're on TV stations.
[01:51:04.346 --> 01:51:05.607]  We're growing there.
[01:51:05.607 --> 01:51:09.771]  But ladies and gentlemen, if they can no platform us on the web, they can do it to you or anybody else.
[01:51:09.771 --> 01:51:10.972]  And they've hidden it.
[01:51:10.972 --> 01:51:12.393]  They've discriminated against us.
[01:51:12.393 --> 01:51:16.136]  When they get caught, they back off of it.
[01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:19.579]  This is an attempt to silence Christians and conservatives and nationalists.
[01:51:19.579 --> 01:51:22.102]  But we've never seen Twitter, Facebook and YouTube
[01:51:23.331 --> 01:51:36.720]  Blocking our live streams like they are today because they know I'm pushing a 34 hour emergency broadcast saying no war with Russia, don't strike Russian forces in Syria.
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:43.765]  Trump is wrong to sit there and say that he's going to shoot down Russian aircraft or he's going to attack them or missiles are coming.
[01:51:46.567 --> 01:51:49.088]  And Trump came out and did a 180 today and said he never said he was.
[01:51:49.088 --> 01:51:49.888]  He's not going to do it now.
[01:51:49.888 --> 01:51:53.449]  And Mattis comes out and says they haven't seen evidence yet that Assad did this.
[01:51:53.449 --> 01:51:55.130]  No kidding.
[01:51:55.130 --> 01:51:57.711]  Assad has the Russians pulling out.
[01:51:57.711 --> 01:52:01.472]  Trump just declared victory.
[01:52:01.472 --> 01:52:03.412]  So, they just had massive censorship.
[01:52:03.412 --> 01:52:04.273]  They're testing it for the 2018.
[01:52:06.237 --> 01:52:08.237]  They're gonna do it again right before the election.
[01:52:08.237 --> 01:52:15.159]  They're just wearing us out, getting everybody used to us whining, so that when we get censored again, no one wants to tune in or hear about it.
[01:52:15.159 --> 01:52:18.780]  They're weakening us, dialing us back ahead of 2018.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:22.621]  Well, guess what?
[01:52:22.621 --> 01:52:30.163]  They can file a thousand lawsuits, and we'll be able to deflect them, and hold them off for at least three years, even if they were legitimate.
[01:52:30.163 --> 01:52:33.083]  I've got top counsel on analysis of it.
[01:52:33.083 --> 01:52:34.964]  But, they're filing them every week now.
[01:52:36.325 --> 01:52:39.587]  So we have to counter-sue, and that's where the real money comes in.
[01:52:39.587 --> 01:52:55.599]  I have to start, and the good part about him suing me a bunch of these in Texas is, I can then get serious damages under the slapback provision here, when it's shown to be something that was ridiculous, and statutorily not correct, and it was done to shut down my speech.
[01:52:55.599 --> 01:53:01.123]  But they've got to be punished, so enough of these people can't be induced by the Democrat law firms to do it.
[01:53:01.123 --> 01:53:03.545]  So this is the fight for free speech.
[01:53:05.532 --> 01:53:14.115]  Alright, we've got Rick DeSantis, and I don't like people when they call in saying who they are, because I remember I've had him on as a few guests, but I can't remember, you know, voices perfectly.
[01:53:14.115 --> 01:53:22.358]  So it becomes an issue with people calling in saying they're someone, and then that becomes a liability for us.
[01:53:22.358 --> 01:53:31.201]  And I'm not saying Rick's doing that, it probably is Rick, a 9-11 survivor who's been on the show before, but just as a rule for the producers, it's fine to have people on as guests,
[01:53:31.801 --> 01:53:36.343]  We just can't say they're guests if we haven't contacted them through their known handle and certified them.
[01:53:36.343 --> 01:53:39.244]  It's kind of like the blue check on Twitter.
[01:53:39.244 --> 01:53:44.207]  And it's kind of a moment because I see that on the screen and you don't really know.
[01:53:44.207 --> 01:53:50.029]  It's like saying Alex Jones is calling in, but we'll go to him and get his take on Syria here right now.
[01:53:50.029 --> 01:53:53.091]  So someone saying he's Rick DeSantis has called in.
[01:53:53.091 --> 01:53:53.571]  Go ahead, Rick.
[01:53:54.875 --> 01:53:56.137]  Alex, I apologize.
[01:53:56.137 --> 01:53:57.839]  It is Rick DeSantis.
[01:53:57.839 --> 01:53:58.600]  No, no, no, no.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:01.064]  I'm just teaching the producers something.
[01:54:01.064 --> 01:54:01.504]  You're awesome.
[01:54:01.504 --> 01:54:03.267]  It doesn't matter.
[01:54:03.267 --> 01:54:06.291]  People get pissed when I don't let them call in and say who they are without proof.
[01:54:06.291 --> 01:54:06.532]  Go ahead.
[01:54:07.401 --> 01:54:09.702]  Well, I'm calling not because of who I am.
[01:54:09.702 --> 01:54:11.743]  I'm calling because I'm an American citizen.
[01:54:11.743 --> 01:54:13.705]  One, let me say thank you to you.
[01:54:13.705 --> 01:54:18.347]  You've been out front kicking the hits, whether it was 9-11, it was Oklahoma.
[01:54:18.347 --> 01:54:22.009]  You're here now with the issue of Syria, and I'm going to make this quick.
[01:54:22.009 --> 01:54:29.634]  I've sacrificed as many as tens of thousands have with regards to 9-11, never getting help, never asking for anything.
[01:54:29.634 --> 01:54:31.355]  We've been suffering with our illnesses.
[01:54:31.355 --> 01:54:32.555]  We're still dying.
[01:54:32.555 --> 01:54:34.717]  Now we're back here with Syria again.
[01:54:34.717 --> 01:54:35.697]  Okay?
[01:54:35.697 --> 01:54:37.098]  I'm going to just say this.
[01:54:37.819 --> 01:54:40.160]  I'm going to ask the world to do it.
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:46.023]  I'm demanding that Vladimir Putin, President Putin, get to the U.N.
[01:54:46.023 --> 01:54:49.604]  and President Trump get there too with him.
[01:54:49.604 --> 01:54:52.025]  And the both of them give a press conference.
[01:54:52.025 --> 01:54:54.046]  And I am challenging President Putin
[01:54:54.724 --> 01:54:55.125]  We're good.
[01:55:11.906 --> 01:55:13.828]  Because it'll take their legs out.
[01:55:13.828 --> 01:55:15.710]  It'll neutralize everything.
[01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:17.992]  And by the way, Rick, I've met you in person.
[01:55:17.992 --> 01:55:18.793]  You've been on many times.
[01:55:18.793 --> 01:55:20.374]  You haven't been on in probably six, seven years.
[01:55:20.374 --> 01:55:21.836]  I recognize your voice.
[01:55:21.836 --> 01:55:23.177]  You've hung out in New York and stuff.
[01:55:23.177 --> 01:55:24.038]  God bless you.
[01:55:24.038 --> 01:55:27.021]  And what you're saying is what I should have started the broadcast with.
[01:55:27.021 --> 01:55:30.484]  It's time for Putin to come to the U.S.
[01:55:30.484 --> 01:55:32.526]  two months before, a week before, whatever.
[01:55:32.526 --> 01:55:33.827]  Challenge Trump to come there.
[01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:35.702]  To meet with him.
[01:55:35.702 --> 01:55:36.743]  He should have already met with him.
[01:55:36.743 --> 01:55:40.526]  He should have been the second or third leader he met with.
[01:55:40.526 --> 01:55:44.629]  And it's just completely outrageous that almost a year and a half later he hasn't met with him.
[01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:59.222]  And just get this out in the open and absolutely roll back the neocons, the deep state, and all the rest of them by getting out front of it, not proving how, you know, cool we are with the CIA director bragging about we've killed hundreds of Russians through a congressional panel today.
[01:55:59.222 --> 01:56:01.264]  This is the stuff that World War III is made of.
[01:56:02.079 --> 01:56:02.840]  Yes.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.280]  Yes.
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.842]  And that disgusts me.
[01:56:04.842 --> 01:56:06.243]  And these are cowards.
[01:56:06.243 --> 01:56:07.625]  These aren't men.
[01:56:07.625 --> 01:56:10.388]  Making peace is harder than making war.
[01:56:10.388 --> 01:56:11.649]  And we've been through enough.
[01:56:12.253 --> 01:56:13.674]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:56:13.674 --> 01:56:15.835]  I'm tired of the sacrifices.
[01:56:15.835 --> 01:56:17.877]  And I'm very blessed to have a good congressman.
[01:56:17.877 --> 01:56:18.557]  You've had him on.
[01:56:18.557 --> 01:56:19.098]  He's great.
[01:56:19.098 --> 01:56:20.138]  And he's the real deal.
[01:56:20.138 --> 01:56:21.659]  I can tell you that straight up.
[01:56:21.659 --> 01:56:22.480]  Okay?
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.561]  And I'm tired of this.
[01:56:23.561 --> 01:56:24.601]  You gotta be tired.
[01:56:24.601 --> 01:56:26.002]  I don't know how you keep doing it.
[01:56:26.002 --> 01:56:27.343]  Are you talking about Gates?
[01:56:27.343 --> 01:56:29.104]  Are you talking about Gates?
[01:56:29.104 --> 01:56:29.504]  Yes.
[01:56:29.504 --> 01:56:30.345]  Yes.
[01:56:30.345 --> 01:56:30.585]  Yes.
[01:56:30.585 --> 01:56:31.626]  He is spot on.
[01:56:31.626 --> 01:56:33.067]  He's the real deal.
[01:56:33.067 --> 01:56:34.808]  And they're coming at him too.
[01:56:34.808 --> 01:56:35.608]  Make no mistake.
[01:56:35.608 --> 01:56:37.209]  They're coming at all of us.
[01:56:37.209 --> 01:56:39.271]  I utilize my email with your stuff.
[01:56:39.831 --> 01:56:41.352]  I get it out everywhere.
[01:56:41.352 --> 01:56:42.213]  I'm on the phone.
[01:56:42.213 --> 01:56:45.535]  As you know, this petition just went forward with the grand jury.
[01:56:45.535 --> 01:56:50.177]  I utilize, I listen to you on my phone, my tablet, my laptop.
[01:56:50.177 --> 01:56:55.681]  Well, that's why they're so angry, Rick, is they can't stop people sharing this by hand, by word of mouth.
[01:56:55.681 --> 01:57:03.606]  So now they're moving to the last phase after putting us in the Internet ghetto, trying to shut down NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:03.606 --> 01:57:06.007]  But if you stand with us, we will stand together.
[01:57:06.007 --> 01:57:06.467]  We will win.
[01:57:06.467 --> 01:57:07.148]  God bless you, Rick.
[01:57:07.668 --> 01:57:08.989]  And I'm glad that Rick called in.
[01:57:08.989 --> 01:57:12.851]  I was just, as a rule, sometimes folks call in and say, hey, it's such and such.
[01:57:12.851 --> 01:57:15.372]  It could be somebody spoofing you.
[01:57:15.372 --> 01:57:16.693]  Then they say, I did that.
[01:57:16.693 --> 01:57:18.033]  Then I get sued.
[01:57:18.033 --> 01:57:20.155]  And it'd be thrown out.
[01:57:20.155 --> 01:57:25.097]  But it's the same deal over and over and over again as they try to shut us down.
[01:57:25.097 --> 01:57:26.358]  It's a true mark of honor.
[01:57:26.358 --> 01:57:28.379]  And I appreciate you all for your support.
[01:57:28.379 --> 01:57:29.439]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:29.439 --> 01:57:29.940]  Whatever you do.
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:31.841]  Hand-share.
[01:57:31.841 --> 01:57:34.584]  Experience Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube if it's happening.
[01:57:34.584 --> 01:57:35.565]  Blocking Infowars.
[01:57:35.565 --> 01:57:37.468]  Experience them kicking you off.
[01:57:37.468 --> 01:57:38.769]  And then do the smart thing.
[01:57:38.769 --> 01:57:44.635]  Grab our videos, re-upload them to your channel, and give it a name like Puppy Dogs and Kittens or I Love Obama.
[01:57:44.635 --> 01:57:46.157]  Don't put Alex Jones in the search term.
[01:57:46.157 --> 01:57:47.118]  It'll get millions of views.
[01:57:47.118 --> 01:57:47.979]  Mike in Arizona.
[01:57:47.979 --> 01:57:49.040]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:49.341]  Go ahead.
[01:57:50.251 --> 01:57:52.173]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:57:52.173 --> 01:58:01.560]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:58:02.670 --> 01:58:09.132]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:58:09.132 --> 01:58:11.392]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:58:11.392 --> 01:58:12.452]  Thank you.
[01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:14.933]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:58:14.933 --> 01:58:19.254]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:58:19.254 --> 01:58:22.275]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:58:22.275 --> 01:58:23.595]  They are quality.
[01:58:23.595 --> 01:58:25.315]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:58:25.315 --> 01:58:28.216]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:58:28.216 --> 01:58:28.776]  Absolutely.
[01:58:29.276 --> 01:58:42.188]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:58:48.303 --> 01:58:54.605]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[01:58:54.605 --> 01:59:03.007]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:59:03.007 --> 01:59:08.088]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:59:08.088 --> 01:59:08.848]  We only have 150%.
[01:59:08.848 --> 01:59:09.949]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[01:59:11.829 --> 01:59:14.651]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[01:59:14.651 --> 01:59:23.077]  That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[01:59:23.077 --> 01:59:24.898]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[01:59:24.898 --> 01:59:26.399]  But the two go together.
[01:59:26.399 --> 01:59:28.421]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[01:59:28.421 --> 01:59:37.567]  They're both 50% off individually, or together they're 50% off, and free shipping with the combo at infowarsandlife.com.
[01:59:37.907 --> 01:59:43.089]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[01:59:43.089 --> 01:59:51.271]  InfoWarsLive.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[01:59:51.271 --> 01:59:53.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:03.585 --> 02:00:12.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[02:00:24.110 --> 02:00:32.333]  We're now into hour number three, and that means we are one, two, three, four, five, five hours of the global transmission have elapsed.
[02:00:32.333 --> 02:00:33.594]  David Knight kicked it off at 8 a.m.
[02:00:33.594 --> 02:00:34.554]  this morning.
[02:00:34.554 --> 02:00:36.795]  Owen Schroer is coming up, and we've got a huge list.
[02:00:36.795 --> 02:00:44.538]  In fact, you guys print me a list of the folks that are coming up during the 34-hour historic Stop World War III with Russia broadcast.
[02:00:44.538 --> 02:00:51.701]  It was going to be Stop the Collapse of America, Stop the Removal of Trump, but that just kicked into this whole other gear.
[02:00:52.611 --> 02:00:53.911]  And there's so much I'm going to be covering.
[02:00:53.911 --> 02:00:54.932]  I'll continue with your calls.
[02:00:54.932 --> 02:01:03.795]  Mark Faber is just joining us for, I think, one or two segments on the economy and his take on war and all the rest of it.
[02:01:03.795 --> 02:01:06.316]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[02:01:06.316 --> 02:01:08.516]  Let's talk to John in New York.
[02:01:08.516 --> 02:01:10.157]  Thanks for holding, sir.
[02:01:10.157 --> 02:01:11.817]  You're on the air.
[02:01:11.817 --> 02:01:12.598]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:12.598 --> 02:01:13.358]  How are you?
[02:01:13.358 --> 02:01:15.079]  I'm all right, my friend.
[02:01:15.079 --> 02:01:16.179]  Real quick.
[02:01:16.179 --> 02:01:19.320]  One thing that people don't talk about is that Assad
[02:01:20.037 --> 02:01:30.039]  Not only enjoying so much recent success, but the fact that his stock market was up about 200% since Trump came into office.
[02:01:30.039 --> 02:01:33.399]  That's the best performing stock market in the world.
[02:01:33.399 --> 02:01:36.140]  His currency was up 30%.
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:38.020]  He had everything in his hand.
[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:40.080]  And then Trump says, we're leaving.
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:42.861]  And all of a sudden, you get another attack.
[02:01:42.861 --> 02:01:46.342]  So there are people, obviously, there that want us back.
[02:01:46.342 --> 02:01:47.962]  They want us to hit him hard.
[02:01:47.962 --> 02:01:48.942]  But it's about pipeline.
[02:01:49.966 --> 02:01:50.806]  Not about anything else.
[02:01:50.806 --> 02:02:03.091]  If you take a look at the map, right now, of Eurasia, and you take a look at Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States and Qatar, they have an enormous amount of natural gas.
[02:02:03.091 --> 02:02:09.993]  Now it costs twice as much to deliver natural gas by tankers, liquefied natural gas.
[02:02:09.993 --> 02:02:13.254]  About six and a half dollars a million cubic feet.
[02:02:13.254 --> 02:02:15.095]  Alright, you listening?
[02:02:15.095 --> 02:02:18.896]  The other thing is, most important, is Russia, their main export is natural gas.
[02:02:19.471 --> 02:02:24.932]  Going into Europe, and it's about $2.90 a million cubic feet.
[02:02:24.932 --> 02:02:37.334]  What we're trying to do, if I'm correct, is we're trying to kill Russia economically, just like what happened with them in the 80s with the Afghan war, while they're trying to build a pipeline there.
[02:02:37.334 --> 02:02:41.095]  Now what happened with Bill Casey and Ronald Reagan in the 80s?
[02:02:41.095 --> 02:02:45.935]  They developed the futures exchange for oil contracts.
[02:02:45.935 --> 02:02:48.916]  In 1983, you can look it up, the book called The Oil Card.
[02:02:49.537 --> 02:02:50.958]  Which is very important, everybody should read it.
[02:02:50.958 --> 02:02:54.721]  This is the economic warfare that nobody talks about.
[02:02:54.721 --> 02:03:01.647]  And Bill Casey from the CIA, they worked on developing Chicago Mercantile Exchange oil futures for oil.
[02:03:01.647 --> 02:03:05.310]  At that point, there was a 17-year bear market in oil.
[02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:07.152]  It destroyed Russia.
[02:03:07.152 --> 02:03:11.035]  This is the same backstory nobody's talking about.
[02:03:11.035 --> 02:03:17.320]  Iran, Russia, their energy, or Saudi Arabia, Qatar, their energy going into Europe.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:18.461]  We're just trying to block them.
[02:03:19.113 --> 02:03:23.155]  We also have an enormous amount of liquefied natural gas we're developing.
[02:03:23.155 --> 02:03:25.137]  Russia's in a lot of trouble.
[02:03:25.137 --> 02:03:25.637]  That's right.
[02:03:25.637 --> 02:03:27.538]  Russia's stock market, we can pull that up.
[02:03:27.538 --> 02:03:29.399]  Russia's stock market has crashed this week.
[02:03:29.399 --> 02:03:32.501]  Just type in Russia's stock market crash and click news.
[02:03:32.501 --> 02:03:33.822]  You can see their stuff straight down.
[02:03:33.822 --> 02:03:35.543]  And that's economic warfare.
[02:03:35.543 --> 02:03:36.824]  We've got troops on their border.
[02:03:36.824 --> 02:03:38.665]  They're trying to fight radical Islam.
[02:03:38.665 --> 02:03:40.146]  I'm a free market guy.
[02:03:40.146 --> 02:03:43.448]  I don't think you should stop those pipelines going through.
[02:03:43.448 --> 02:03:46.530]  Just like I don't think China should be able to go take over the South China Sea.
[02:03:47.816 --> 02:03:51.080]  And declare they own and run everything as well.
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.661]  That is wrong.
[02:03:52.661 --> 02:03:53.763]  I am a free market guy.
[02:03:53.763 --> 02:03:55.164]  And this is globalism.
[02:03:55.164 --> 02:03:56.646]  And when the Chinese do it, it's wrong.
[02:03:56.646 --> 02:03:58.508]  And when America does it, it's wrong.
[02:03:58.508 --> 02:04:03.373]  And Trump claims, you know, he's this free market guy that wants competition and lower prices for everybody.
[02:04:03.373 --> 02:04:03.934]  Let's do it.
[02:04:03.934 --> 02:04:04.475]  Let's let...
[02:04:05.987 --> 02:04:10.492]  Let's let, you know, those pipelines bring Syrian gas into Europe.
[02:04:10.492 --> 02:04:14.355]  That's how you're going to build up their profit and make them a first world nation.
[02:04:14.355 --> 02:04:20.662]  Instead, no, I understand the little piggies in Saudi Arabia and the globalists, they've got to be the only ones that can ship it in.
[02:04:20.662 --> 02:04:23.705]  And they don't want to ship it by the super tanker into there.
[02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:26.405]  Yeah.
[02:04:26.405 --> 02:04:36.407]  Well, the bottom line is, this is basically the story and the theme that nobody wants to talk about or wants to be on TV talking about, because that, I think, is what really is going on.
[02:04:36.407 --> 02:04:44.588]  You know, the fact is, just look up that book, The Oil Carters, an unbelievable book by a guy, I forgot his name, James Norman.
[02:04:44.588 --> 02:04:50.129]  Well, sir, what you're saying is, I've read the books, we've been covering this for seven years, you are 1,000% correct.
[02:04:50.129 --> 02:04:52.890]  Afghanistan is about that as well, and rare earth minerals.
[02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:53.930]  We'll be back with more calls.
[02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:54.370]  Thank you, John.
[02:04:56.286 --> 02:04:59.688]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:04:59.688 --> 02:05:03.651]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:05:03.651 --> 02:05:06.993]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:06.993 --> 02:05:09.535]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:05:09.535 --> 02:05:13.898]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:05:14.258 --> 02:05:23.621]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:23.621 --> 02:05:30.804]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:31.804 --> 02:05:36.867]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:36.867 --> 02:05:44.510]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.

[02:05:49.413 --> 02:05:52.334]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:56.861 --> 02:05:57.902]  Breaking the conditioning!
[02:05:57.902 --> 02:05:59.063]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[02:05:59.063 --> 02:05:59.884]  Alex Jones.
[02:05:59.884 --> 02:06:00.645]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:00.645 --> 02:06:01.285]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:01.285 --> 02:06:04.468]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[02:06:04.468 --> 02:06:13.937]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[02:06:13.937 --> 02:06:15.799]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:06:15.799 --> 02:06:19.543]  It sounds like it confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[02:06:21.188 --> 02:06:25.273]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[02:06:25.273 --> 02:06:28.437]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[02:06:28.437 --> 02:06:31.441]  It was almost as if there were planned explosions.
[02:06:31.441 --> 02:06:32.802]  It's just pancakes.
[02:06:32.802 --> 02:06:37.448]  He took the babies out of incubators and left them choking to die on the cold floor.
[02:06:37.768 --> 02:06:40.249]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[02:06:40.249 --> 02:06:47.913]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[02:06:47.913 --> 02:06:48.713]  U.S.A.
[02:06:48.713 --> 02:06:50.834]  Is this global governance at last?
[02:06:50.834 --> 02:06:53.395]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[02:06:53.395 --> 02:06:55.656]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[02:06:55.656 --> 02:06:56.697]  Some former U.S.
[02:06:56.697 --> 02:06:58.797]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[02:06:58.797 --> 02:07:01.999]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[02:07:02.279 --> 02:07:07.923]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[02:07:07.923 --> 02:07:09.444]  Russian scum!
[02:07:09.444 --> 02:07:11.786]  Denied everything and called it all fake news.
[02:07:11.786 --> 02:07:13.907]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[02:07:13.907 --> 02:07:16.909]  This is a national emergency.
[02:07:16.909 --> 02:07:22.433]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[02:07:22.433 --> 02:07:24.074]  This is a FEMA high-level alert.
[02:07:25.515 --> 02:07:28.016]  We are at war with Russia.
[02:07:28.016 --> 02:07:33.357]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange on WikiLeaks?
[02:07:33.357 --> 02:07:36.718]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[02:07:36.718 --> 02:07:39.518]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:43.959]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:07:43.959 --> 02:07:45.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:07:49.031 --> 02:08:08.460]  Alright, for the next two segments, the world-famous Dr. Mark Faber of the big global report, Gloom, Boom, Doom, is going to be joining us, and I wanted to get him on a few weeks ago just about the world economy and things like that, but obviously, Russia, Syria, all the things that are happening there, we're going to get his take as a smart cookie on that.
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:12.762]  At the bottom of the hour, he'll be gone, and we'll go right to your phone calls.
[02:08:14.213 --> 02:08:18.257]  Again, he is the editor and publisher of the Gloom, Boom and Doom Report, born in Zurich, Switzerland.
[02:08:18.257 --> 02:08:19.098]  He went to school in Geneva.
[02:08:19.098 --> 02:08:30.369]  I'm not going to go over his whole background and how successful he's been with all the different investment newsletters and advice he's given all the different companies and investment things that he's headed up.
[02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:32.612]  Tomorrow's Gold, Asia's Age of Discovery.
[02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:36.054]  I want to get into this whole geopolitical system and why the West is attacking Russia.
[02:08:57.935 --> 02:08:58.796]  I'm not a Russophile.
[02:08:58.796 --> 02:08:59.856]  I've never been to Russia.
[02:08:59.856 --> 02:09:01.397]  I have gotten my visa.
[02:09:01.397 --> 02:09:03.338]  I tweeted it out a few months ago as a joke.
[02:09:03.338 --> 02:09:10.022]  The media uses that as an example that I'm a Russian spy and then says, Jones says he hasn't been to Russia, but here's his visa.
[02:09:10.022 --> 02:09:14.705]  Yeah, it's not stamped, morons, but going to Russia doesn't make you a Russian agent.
[02:09:14.705 --> 02:09:18.748]  Any more than having Mark Faber on or going to Switzerland makes you Swiss.
[02:09:18.748 --> 02:09:20.369]  Now that might be somewhere I actually would move.
[02:09:21.978 --> 02:09:24.279]  Anyways, Mark Faber is here with us.
[02:09:24.279 --> 02:09:25.860]  I could be a Swissophile.
[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:32.762]  The whole William Tell and their ethos is what actually America picked up more than anything is the Swiss ethos became 1776.
[02:09:32.762 --> 02:09:36.043]  That's a little known fact, but the founders talked about that.
[02:09:36.043 --> 02:09:37.584]  They had the Second Amendment before we did.
[02:09:37.584 --> 02:09:39.325]  But I'm digressing!
[02:09:39.325 --> 02:09:40.865]  Mark Faber joins us.
[02:09:40.865 --> 02:09:44.907]  Mark, wow, what a crazy time to be alive with the neocons and the left.
[02:09:45.447 --> 02:10:00.037]  Well, different people have obviously different views.
[02:10:00.037 --> 02:10:14.306]  And I think that America must get used to the fact that foreign countries that have become economically very important have also more geopolitical influence.
[02:10:15.287 --> 02:10:21.732]  Then before and they have a look at the world from a totally different perspective.
[02:10:21.732 --> 02:10:24.414]  You're sitting in Beijing.
[02:10:24.414 --> 02:10:31.740]  It's of strategic importance for you to control the South China Sea.
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:44.871]  The way it is strategically important for the US to control basically the Panama Canal, the Caribbean and have friendly neighbors, both in Mexico.
[02:10:45.752 --> 02:10:52.996]  And in Canada, and not to have, say, Chinese and Russian bases in these areas.
[02:10:52.996 --> 02:10:56.397]  So the perspective of the Chinese is very different.
[02:10:56.397 --> 02:11:00.900]  The Russian, they have also very different perspective.
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:04.121]  And I'd like to mention here one point.
[02:11:04.121 --> 02:11:11.345]  Mr. Putin is a relatively tolerant Russian leader.
[02:11:11.345 --> 02:11:11.765]  He's not
[02:11:12.832 --> 02:11:18.678]  A vicious czar has characterized Russian history.
[02:11:18.678 --> 02:11:21.541]  He's no Stalin, for instance.
[02:11:21.541 --> 02:11:23.623]  And Stalin, keep in mind,
[02:11:24.741 --> 02:11:31.603]  When you ask Russians who is the most popular leader in their history, it's Stalin, remarkably.
[02:11:31.603 --> 02:11:32.883]  Because he was seen as a strong man.
[02:11:32.883 --> 02:11:38.044]  But I would say in many ways, hasn't Putin, at least economically, culturally, been a reformer?
[02:11:38.044 --> 02:11:45.926]  A. B. Why do the globalists and the Anglo-American establishment fear Putin so much?
[02:11:45.926 --> 02:11:53.068]  Well, they wanted basically to annex or bring Ukraine into the Western
[02:11:54.815 --> 02:11:59.557]  He came only dominated by NATO and the US.
[02:11:59.557 --> 02:12:05.398]  And you have to understand, Ukraine was a Russian territory.
[02:12:05.398 --> 02:12:10.540]  It became Ukraine at the beginning of the 20th century.
[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:19.202]  But the eastern part of Ukraine, anything that is east of the Dnieper, that's a river,
[02:12:20.331 --> 02:12:25.832]  And that is clearly Russian and not Ukraine.
[02:12:25.832 --> 02:12:33.354]  And Poland was also, it didn't exist in the 19th century.
[02:12:33.354 --> 02:12:36.715]  It only became into existence very late.
[02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:41.556]  It was part of Germany and part of Russia.
[02:12:41.556 --> 02:12:49.598]  The Russian border went to Germany and the Russians were at the time, yes, exactly as you show it,
[02:12:50.610 --> 02:12:54.914]  They were very close to the Europeans.
[02:12:54.914 --> 02:13:01.118]  The Russian culture is much more European than what people perceive it to be.
[02:13:01.118 --> 02:13:05.101]  And let's expand on that, because again, you live right there in Switzerland, so you understand the culture.
[02:13:05.101 --> 02:13:06.603]  Other people who aren't living there don't.
[02:13:06.603 --> 02:13:10.265]  But I can read history books, and even my wife, who's smart, listens to NPR.
[02:13:10.265 --> 02:13:12.727]  She's more of a libertarian, but she listens to NPR when she's driving.
[02:13:12.727 --> 02:13:14.549]  And about six months ago, or a year ago, she's like,
[02:13:15.762 --> 02:13:16.923]  Well, you know, Putin's bad.
[02:13:16.923 --> 02:13:19.865]  He invaded Ukraine and took it from the Ukrainians.
[02:13:19.865 --> 02:13:22.207]  And I'm like, Eastern Ukraine's always been part of Russia.
[02:13:22.207 --> 02:13:25.750]  Russia was founded in Eastern Ukraine.
[02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:30.975]  It's always a split between Orthodox under the Tsarist and Catholics.
[02:13:30.975 --> 02:13:32.957]  Hitler took over Ukraine and killed a bunch of people.
[02:13:32.957 --> 02:13:33.877]  The Russians did too.
[02:13:33.877 --> 02:13:36.980]  But Russia was born, you know, there.
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:38.341]  And then she's like, really?
[02:13:38.341 --> 02:13:38.621]  Really?
[02:13:38.621 --> 02:13:39.782]  They say Putin invaded.
[02:13:39.782 --> 02:13:39.882]  No.
[02:13:40.623 --> 02:13:42.824]  Soros overthrew the country.
[02:13:42.824 --> 02:13:44.245]  They overthrew an elected government.
[02:13:44.245 --> 02:13:45.346]  And we're going to take the whole thing.
[02:13:45.346 --> 02:13:49.368]  And the Russians decided, in Russian-held areas, to take over their own areas.
[02:13:49.368 --> 02:13:53.270]  And then you've got, what, the son of the former vice president.
[02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:54.691]  He runs the gas company there.
[02:13:54.691 --> 02:13:55.572]  Joe Biden's son.
[02:13:55.572 --> 02:13:57.973]  I mean, the looting in Ukraine is insane.
[02:13:57.973 --> 02:13:59.254]  What's the current state of Ukraine?
[02:14:01.547 --> 02:14:04.568]  Well, I mean, economically, they're not doing particularly well.
[02:14:04.568 --> 02:14:08.810]  But I have to say, there was a great investment opportunity.
[02:14:08.810 --> 02:14:15.112]  Ukrainian bonds have performed very well last year, and equities as well.
[02:14:15.112 --> 02:14:22.895]  So I think we better study history to understand some of the background.
[02:14:22.895 --> 02:14:29.177]  Now the Russians, as I said, Putin is a relative moderate leader.
[02:14:30.054 --> 02:14:51.832]  But there are other people in Russia that are less moderate, and he has to intervene in order not to lose Eastern Ukraine, especially, especially because the American wanted to establish military bases in Ukraine and the missile bases.
[02:14:51.832 --> 02:14:58.318]  Secondly, if you look at the map you just showed, it is very clear that for
[02:14:59.912 --> 02:15:16.684]  The Russian, the Crimea, is of paramount importance strategically, because without the Crimea, basically, they have no access to the Mediterranean.
[02:15:16.684 --> 02:15:21.347]  And that, I guarantee you, they will never give up Crimea.
[02:15:23.254 --> 02:15:30.133]  Where Russia was founded, but the average person doesn't know that Europe basically founded Russia in its modern sense with the czars, that then...
[02:15:31.209 --> 02:15:39.651]  Buzar was basically genetically identical to the King of England at the very same time, or that, you know, any of that.
[02:15:39.651 --> 02:15:42.771]  They think history is a disease and an enemy.
[02:15:42.771 --> 02:15:51.033]  And even my average fellow American, again, knows all the football scores, but nothing about any historical facts, and that is why we are becoming slaves.
[02:15:51.033 --> 02:15:53.714]  We'll be back with Mark Faber to talk World War III, the economy, and more.
[02:15:53.714 --> 02:15:54.074]  Stay with us.
[02:15:55.239 --> 02:15:57.140]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.

[02:18:46.975 --> 02:18:47.875]  That means it's pure.
[02:18:48.055 --> 02:18:53.797]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:18:53.797 --> 02:18:55.238]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:19:08.703 --> 02:19:11.564]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:19:11.564 --> 02:19:13.044]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.044 --> 02:19:19.887]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.887 --> 02:19:21.947]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:21.947 --> 02:19:31.670]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:36.652]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[02:19:36.772 --> 02:19:48.475]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.475 --> 02:19:51.775]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.775 --> 02:19:59.297]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:19:59.297 --> 02:20:01.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:12.755 --> 02:20:21.161]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:39.688 --> 02:20:42.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:20:42.730 --> 02:20:48.914]  One more segment with Mark Faber, the editor and publisher of the Gloom, Boom, Doom report.
[02:20:48.914 --> 02:20:51.175]  Gloomboomdoom.com.
[02:20:51.175 --> 02:20:53.396]  I want to get him on about the economy, but now this war stuff happened.
[02:20:53.396 --> 02:20:58.419]  There's nothing bigger for the economy, obviously, than a natural disaster or a war.
[02:20:58.419 --> 02:20:58.800]  Trump.
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:00.000]  I'm a big supporter of Trump.
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.421]  I like Trump.
[02:21:01.421 --> 02:21:02.402]  I know he's a patriot, but
[02:21:03.666 --> 02:21:07.588]  Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria at their bases.
[02:21:07.588 --> 02:21:08.689]  How dare them?
[02:21:08.689 --> 02:21:09.809]  I'm going to punch you in the teeth.
[02:21:09.809 --> 02:21:12.311]  If you put your hands up, I'm going to break your neck.
[02:21:12.311 --> 02:21:16.793]  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart.
[02:21:16.793 --> 02:21:22.716]  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it.
[02:21:22.716 --> 02:21:25.858]  All three of the previous attacks have been confirmed by the Pentagon and the UN.
[02:21:26.718 --> 02:21:27.838]  That were launched by the rebels.
[02:21:27.838 --> 02:21:30.899]  This fourth, now the Russians say, was launched by the rebels again.
[02:21:30.899 --> 02:21:34.840]  Secretary of Defense comes out today and says, yeah, we don't have evidence Russia did it.
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:35.760]  That should be big news.
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:40.142]  But instead, David Knight just got a notification from YouTube.
[02:21:40.142 --> 02:21:44.343]  Again, we're on a bunch of radio and TV stations, but it's like more censorship than we've ever seen today.
[02:21:45.143 --> 02:21:48.669]  We're demonetizing your videos and blocking them from this morning.
[02:21:48.669 --> 02:21:51.533]  The three hours that he did on these very subjects.
[02:21:51.533 --> 02:21:55.439]  They don't want you to see the Secretary of Defense saying, we don't have evidence Russia did this.
[02:21:55.439 --> 02:21:57.783]  They don't want you to hear the Russian ambassador saying the same thing.
[02:21:58.894 --> 02:21:59.935]  No.
[02:21:59.935 --> 02:22:03.317]  You don't want to hear that there's deep state actors staging false flags.
[02:22:03.317 --> 02:22:08.400]  So they are just blocking us everywhere because we're trying to have an anti-war broadcast.
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:10.401]  Because there's no evidence Russia's done anything.
[02:22:10.401 --> 02:22:14.724]  Mark Faber, what is your take on what's happening to Trump and the pressure he's under to do this?
[02:22:14.724 --> 02:22:17.505]  Because just yesterday he said he was going to strike him.
[02:22:17.505 --> 02:22:19.266]  Now he seems to be backing off of that some.
[02:22:19.266 --> 02:22:20.007]  What do you think's happening?
[02:22:22.128 --> 02:22:29.792]  Well, I mean, you have to say he has surrounded himself by some neocons.
[02:22:29.792 --> 02:22:32.874]  Bolton is one of them, of course.
[02:22:32.874 --> 02:22:36.716]  And they would like to intervene here and there.
[02:22:36.716 --> 02:22:44.040]  But I'd just like to explain one point that I think is important to understand.
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:48.462]  At the beginning of the 20th century, in 1905, there was a
[02:22:53.594 --> 02:23:05.142]  And he explained the difference between a naval power and a land power.
[02:23:05.142 --> 02:23:11.787]  Germany was a land power, Britain was a naval power.
[02:23:11.787 --> 02:23:19.012]  And he established essentially the thinking that whoever would control the homeland
[02:23:19.716 --> 02:23:26.860]  Which essentially stretches from Germany through Russia, Far East Russia and China.
[02:23:26.860 --> 02:23:32.363]  Whoever would control that homeland would essentially control the world.
[02:23:32.363 --> 02:23:46.410]  And then later on, in the US, there was a Dutch American geopolitician, a geostrategist called Nikolaus Eichmann.
[02:23:47.364 --> 02:23:51.805]  And he established the view that you have to control the Ringland.
[02:23:51.805 --> 02:23:55.025]  In other words, you have to surround Germany.
[02:23:55.025 --> 02:23:57.206]  You have to surround Russia.
[02:23:57.206 --> 02:24:02.747]  You have to surround China with military bases.
[02:24:02.747 --> 02:24:13.909]  And these countries nowadays have become so powerful for different reasons that they don't want to be encircled anymore or cannot tolerate it.
[02:24:14.537 --> 02:24:24.344]  That's right, and at the end of the Cold War, when Russia agreed to lay down its weapons, basically, the West agreed to not take over former Soviet bloc countries.
[02:24:24.344 --> 02:24:25.945]  And then the West violated those agreements.
[02:24:25.945 --> 02:24:27.926]  These are just facts!
[02:24:27.926 --> 02:24:29.488]  Yes, this is a fact.
[02:24:29.488 --> 02:24:31.629]  You're absolutely right.
[02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:41.356]  Russia did not violate anything until the Western countries repeatedly violated the agreement.
[02:24:43.208 --> 02:24:45.048]  Well, they're definitely pushing for a new world war.
[02:24:45.048 --> 02:24:48.469]  Do you agree?
[02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:55.771]  I'm not sure they push for a new world war, but you never know with these politicians what they think.
[02:24:55.771 --> 02:25:06.574]  Because the problem is, this is a generation nowadays that hasn't been to war, and they haven't seen the horrors of war.
[02:25:07.421 --> 02:25:12.042]  People who've been through a war, they don't want the war anymore.
[02:25:12.042 --> 02:25:15.743]  Because it's a horrible undertaking.
[02:25:15.743 --> 02:25:21.585]  But the people that take the decisions about the wars are not the ones that go and fight.
[02:25:21.585 --> 02:25:22.265]  You understand?
[02:25:22.265 --> 02:25:32.308]  When Alexander the Great conquered the Middle East and parts of India, he led the war.
[02:25:32.308 --> 02:25:34.729]  He was leading one of the divisions.
[02:25:35.957 --> 02:25:37.335]  The equestrian
[02:25:38.195 --> 02:25:42.916]  And the other Roman emperors, most of them also went to war.
[02:25:42.916 --> 02:25:45.357]  They didn't sit in Rome and did nothing.
[02:25:45.357 --> 02:25:45.937]  That's right.
[02:25:45.937 --> 02:25:50.618]  Julius Caesar was just as successful as Alexander the Great in many respects.
[02:25:50.618 --> 02:25:55.399]  Spent, what, 40 years of his life leading combat, was never even in Rome.
[02:25:55.399 --> 02:26:00.640]  So in closing, we have this permanent wimp community that constantly wants to attack and start all these wars.
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:03.561]  The generals are the ones telling them, don't start these wars, actually.
[02:26:03.561 --> 02:26:06.842]  I'm not lionizing the generals, but it's... Please continue.
[02:26:08.753 --> 02:26:18.383]  I agree with you that actually the American generals, they remember the war, they've seen also what happened in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
[02:26:18.383 --> 02:26:23.929]  And they know that nowadays, a conventional war cannot be won.
[02:26:23.929 --> 02:26:31.697]  What can happen is that the country sends some missiles with nuclear weapons, and destroys actually a whole country.
[02:26:32.694 --> 02:26:39.150]  But that doesn't serve anybody any good because the adversaries will do exactly the same.
[02:26:39.781 --> 02:26:40.601]  And let's be clear.
[02:26:40.601 --> 02:26:41.642]  Let's say the U.S.
[02:26:41.642 --> 02:26:44.063]  let ourselves be nuked, or Russia vice versa.
[02:26:44.063 --> 02:26:52.306]  That would cause a new nuclear winter, massive radiation death, and it would cause a world financial collapse for sure.
[02:26:52.306 --> 02:26:52.946]  Everybody agrees.
[02:26:52.946 --> 02:26:54.987]  Well, nobody's gonna just take the hit.
[02:26:54.987 --> 02:27:04.291]  And most estimates are total loss of life on the surface of the planet, only cockroaches living, and sea creatures around heat vents.
[02:27:04.291 --> 02:27:07.732]  I don't know who will be living, but I can tell you
[02:27:08.633 --> 02:27:21.062]  If we really have a nuclear war in the world, it's not going to be any fun and the population of the world could shrink quite dramatically.
[02:27:21.062 --> 02:27:31.950]  But we can also have a cyber war where you just destroy the internet infrastructure and then there are no more banking transactions.
[02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:37.454]  You could have a biological warfare where you poison a population
[02:27:38.183 --> 02:27:38.563]  And so forth.
[02:27:38.563 --> 02:27:41.766]  There are lots of possibilities nowadays.
[02:27:41.766 --> 02:27:46.250]  And the best, in my view, would be to kind of compromise.
[02:27:48.407 --> 02:27:50.369]  You know, I was going to let you go now, but I'll let you go to 40 after.
[02:27:50.369 --> 02:27:54.912]  I want to do five more minutes on the other side of the break since you raised this, because you really are a great historian.
[02:27:54.912 --> 02:28:00.056]  I've personally read quite a few history books, but hearing your depth and knowledge, I know it surpasses mine by a long way.
[02:28:00.056 --> 02:28:07.222]  And I want to get into what keeps you awake most at night that's negative, but also what keeps you most excited about positive things.
[02:28:07.222 --> 02:28:12.407]  Mark Faber, Dr. Mark Faber, is our guest of gloomboomdoom.com.
[02:28:12.407 --> 02:28:15.249]  But I also want to ask you when we come back about
[02:28:17.162 --> 02:28:28.425]  Pulling back from this, if we didn't have governments that were always trying to dominate the other government, what's your idea for humanity to have a continuing, expanding economy and a future?
[02:28:28.425 --> 02:28:31.385]  So we'll talk about that briefly with Dr. Mark Faber.
[02:28:31.385 --> 02:28:36.226]  On the other side of the nine problems, we're going to Steve, David, James, James, and many others.

[02:29:04.386 --> 02:29:12.750]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:33:17.561 --> 02:33:21.643]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:33:21.643 --> 02:33:26.645]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.645 --> 02:33:28.926]  Now, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:33:28.926 --> 02:33:31.367]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[02:33:31.367 --> 02:33:38.650]  We're in the middle of a 34-hour emergency broadcast, and the title is, Stop World War with Russia.
[02:33:38.650 --> 02:33:44.793]  And thank God, just yesterday, Trump's like, we're gonna missile strike you, we're gonna kill your people, nothing's gonna stop us.
[02:33:44.793 --> 02:33:46.434]  Today, he's like, I never said I'm gonna attack them.
[02:33:47.637 --> 02:33:50.121]  And the Secretary of Defense is saying, no, we don't have any evidence.
[02:33:50.121 --> 02:33:55.550]  But Pompeo is saying, we've already killed hundreds of Russians in Syria in a congressional testimony.
[02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:56.511]  Let's find that video.
[02:33:56.511 --> 02:33:58.194]  I know Kit ran in and gave me this article.
[02:33:58.194 --> 02:33:59.136]  I guess the video is there.
[02:33:59.136 --> 02:34:00.418]  Let's get that.
[02:34:00.418 --> 02:34:01.379]  So what I'm saying is this.
[02:34:02.601 --> 02:34:11.849]  Globalism is governmental and corporate interests that don't want free market, that try to create combines so big that they create a monopoly capitalist system in their own words.
[02:34:11.849 --> 02:34:19.516]  They have a technological computer system, a technocracy, used to control everybody in their own words.
[02:34:19.516 --> 02:34:27.823]  And then they authoritarianly run around trying to take everybody else over in the world, lecturing those of us that don't want to start fights with Russia and others that we're bad people.
[02:34:30.188 --> 02:34:35.970]  And then attacking us, and lying about us, and saying we're racist, and suing us, and all of the sanctions.
[02:34:35.970 --> 02:34:41.612]  And I know Faber likes China because they're a big engine, and I know they get a bad shake sometimes, but come on.
[02:34:41.612 --> 02:34:43.632]  China sells political dissidence organs.
[02:34:43.632 --> 02:34:45.953]  They're taking over the South China Sea.
[02:34:45.953 --> 02:34:50.035]  If you want to see an authoritarianism, it's allied with the American left, with globalists.
[02:34:50.035 --> 02:34:52.395]  I see China as part of the globalist combine.
[02:34:52.395 --> 02:34:57.257]  I see America, what's left of it, Russia, the Brexit.
[02:34:58.413 --> 02:35:06.020]  And other nationalist movements, what's happening with Viktor Orban in Hungary, I see that as the resistance and where the free market ideas are coming from.
[02:35:06.020 --> 02:35:10.144]  So I kind of see the power constellation maybe different than Dr. Faber, the smart guy, does.
[02:35:10.144 --> 02:35:16.409]  But fundamentally, when we're up here competing with each other in the U.S.
[02:35:16.409 --> 02:35:18.752]  media about who hates Russians more, it's sick.
[02:35:20.365 --> 02:35:27.497]  And it's a globalist anger that they don't have that incredibly resource-filled, biggest nation geographically in the world, and that they can't dominate it.
[02:35:27.497 --> 02:35:32.346]  And it shows how history just keeps repeating, whether it's Russia or Afghanistan, over and over and over again.
[02:35:32.346 --> 02:35:33.888]  So I wanted to ask Dr. Faber, in closing,
[02:35:35.216 --> 02:35:39.920]  What does he quantify globalism is and its whole structure?
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:42.461]  How do we get out of it and what system replaces it?
[02:35:42.461 --> 02:35:53.049]  Because it's gobbled up like a giant squid, what was left of our free market system, stolen European and American and Chinese industry to power its greedy takeover.
[02:35:53.049 --> 02:35:54.851]  It's the true authoritarianism.
[02:35:54.851 --> 02:35:56.192]  And so how do you deal with it?
[02:35:56.192 --> 02:35:57.012]  Identifying it?
[02:35:57.012 --> 02:35:57.833]  Breaking with it?
[02:35:57.833 --> 02:35:58.373]  What do we do?
[02:35:58.373 --> 02:36:01.776]  Or do you disagree with my breakdown of the constellation of this monster?
[02:36:03.509 --> 02:36:06.071]  Well, I don't disagree with you.
[02:36:06.071 --> 02:36:10.755]  And I'm not saying that the Chinese are in any way perfect.
[02:36:10.755 --> 02:36:19.062]  But I want you to also understand, in the Chinese tradition, they never had a democracy.
[02:36:19.062 --> 02:36:22.985]  We never had democracies in the whole of Asia.
[02:36:22.985 --> 02:36:25.867]  We had in China an emperor.
[02:36:25.867 --> 02:36:30.511]  And China was not a country like you would think of a country.
[02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:45.295]  It was the middle kingdom between the earth and heaven with totally different concepts of the worldly picture than we westerners have.
[02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:51.878]  And so we have to understand that for them Xi Jinping is not an evil leader.
[02:36:51.878 --> 02:36:58.441]  He may become an evil leader, but so far the economy has been expanding.
[02:36:58.441 --> 02:37:00.462]  The Chinese and the Russians
[02:37:01.195 --> 02:37:06.077]  Both, in their history, never had it this good.
[02:37:06.077 --> 02:37:18.400]  So they accept, yeah, there are some mistakes in terms of human rights, but worldwide there are things that happen that are not correct.
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:24.942]  The US has intervened in foreign elections for the last hundred years, but repeatedly.
[02:37:24.942 --> 02:37:27.123]  And then when one country
[02:37:28.155 --> 02:37:37.758]  Intervenes, and intervenes in a way that... Sure, so what I'm saying is we obviously have a unipolar world, not a, not a, you know, one system.
[02:37:37.758 --> 02:37:38.718]  That's a fact.
[02:37:38.718 --> 02:37:39.958]  But where is it going?
[02:37:39.958 --> 02:37:42.979]  I mean, what system could capture the hearts and minds of people?
[02:37:42.979 --> 02:37:50.161]  I say 1776, the ideas of Americana, the Swiss ideas, the ideas of the English, the Magna Carta, the Dutch.
[02:37:50.161 --> 02:37:53.582]  I mean, how do we get a new Renaissance, a new Renaissance to take us to the stars?
[02:37:54.718 --> 02:38:09.385]  Well, I believe that eventually, people will rebel against governments because governments have become much too big as a percent of the economy, much too powerful.
[02:38:09.385 --> 02:38:20.730]  And the governments nowadays, in most cases, exceptions like Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, but in most other countries, the government
[02:38:21.588 --> 02:38:28.091]  Actually, it doesn't represent the interest of the people, but represents its own interest.
[02:38:28.091 --> 02:38:31.412]  And that will lead to a revolution one day.
[02:38:31.412 --> 02:38:38.875]  In my opinion, it may end up before we're that far with the end of democracies.
[02:38:38.875 --> 02:38:44.277]  I don't think democracies will survive for the simple reason that for the last 5,000 years,
[02:38:45.996 --> 02:38:47.377]  We never had democracies.
[02:38:47.377 --> 02:38:56.502]  Now, suddenly, for the last hundred years, we have democracies, all democracies, but it's not a tested system.
[02:38:56.502 --> 02:38:57.823]  I think they will all fail.
[02:38:57.823 --> 02:38:59.023]  Well, I mean, I agree with you.
[02:38:59.023 --> 02:39:02.785]  And that's what the demarcation line I want to put here is a third way in there.
[02:39:02.785 --> 02:39:03.606]  We're a republic.
[02:39:04.366 --> 02:39:10.648]  Not like the Soviet Union calls themselves a republic or North Korea does, but a real republic with a republican form of government.
[02:39:10.648 --> 02:39:20.631]  For Democrats that doesn't mean it's a republican party, it means republican and a separation of powers and the states and the federal government and the three branches and all the rest of it.
[02:39:20.631 --> 02:39:24.072]  And that system has delivered more prosperity, more freedom.
[02:39:24.072 --> 02:39:32.875]  It has been pure democratization that allows 51% to make the other 49% slaves and has created another form of tyranny, mob tyranny.
[02:39:33.915 --> 02:39:44.179]  Programmed by, you know, the master architects, the maestros, the conductors, George Soros, the Clintons, the globalists, and others.
[02:39:44.179 --> 02:39:48.080]  So they programmed the mob to then vote the rest of us into slavery and them as well.
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:53.602]  So I agree, that form of democracy is a great tyranny, the howling mob that Jefferson warned of, we have to guard against it.
[02:39:54.102 --> 02:40:19.050]  But to have a real free market system, I call it 1776 worldwide, I see that with Victor Orban and others, again from Brazil, with their leading candidates like a patriot, all over I see Ron Paul type people, Nigel Farage is on fire, I see that as the real answer, and that third way, not strong men that divvy it all out, or not pure howling mob democracies that are probably worse a lot of times,
[02:40:19.770 --> 02:40:21.111]  Yes, but my observation is that
[02:40:47.090 --> 02:41:01.842]  The Swiss model, which is also to a large extent the model that the Scandinavian countries have, is only appropriate and successful in small countries, and I believe in general
[02:41:02.785 --> 02:41:07.526]  That it would be better not to have two big countries that... Sure, and let's be honest.
[02:41:07.526 --> 02:41:08.087]  Let's be honest.
[02:41:08.087 --> 02:41:08.907]  Homogeneous.
[02:41:08.907 --> 02:41:10.527]  I mean, it's one tribe on average.
[02:41:10.527 --> 02:41:11.367]  It's a culture.
[02:41:11.367 --> 02:41:12.448]  They're bound together.
[02:41:12.448 --> 02:41:16.829]  If outsiders come in and adopt the Swiss way, then they would be successful.
[02:41:16.829 --> 02:41:19.910]  But the left has taught people to reject any successful system.
[02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:26.012]  So the Swiss cannot be a, you know, truly modern, quote, mercantile, quote, metro system.
[02:41:26.012 --> 02:41:27.232]  They would disintegrate.
[02:41:29.602 --> 02:41:40.311]  Well, I think one of the key differences of Switzerland compared to other European countries has been we never had any colonies.
[02:41:40.311 --> 02:41:47.937]  We didn't do any, always the right thing, that I admit, but we never had any colonies.
[02:41:47.937 --> 02:41:50.919]  And you're landlocked.
[02:41:50.919 --> 02:41:51.740]  We are landlocked.
[02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:53.802]  And you've got aggressive empires all around you.
[02:41:55.847 --> 02:41:58.288]  Well, relatively aggressive.
[02:41:58.288 --> 02:41:59.369]  Not in the South.
[02:41:59.369 --> 02:42:03.372]  They are no longer... Yeah, not the Italians, not the French, yeah.
[02:42:03.372 --> 02:42:06.914]  But the Germans were quite aggressive.
[02:42:06.914 --> 02:42:14.159]  But during World War II, there was just an article recently in the paper in Switzerland.
[02:42:14.159 --> 02:42:24.106]  Hitler had no intention whatsoever to attack Switzerland because he knew the Swiss are very stubborn and difficult to deal with.
[02:42:24.907 --> 02:42:31.169]  And it would have been very costly to conquer Switzerland for no reward whatsoever.
[02:42:31.169 --> 02:42:32.349]  Thank you very much.
[02:42:58.148 --> 02:42:59.569]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.

[02:47:29.230 --> 02:47:30.310]  Anthony Comey is hosting.
[02:47:30.310 --> 02:47:33.351]  I'm going to get into some of this Mueller stuff first that I haven't had time to get to.
[02:47:33.351 --> 02:47:35.252]  It's incredible, obviously.
[02:47:35.252 --> 02:47:39.273]  And we've also got Ryan may be forced to leave speakership by summer.
[02:47:39.273 --> 02:47:42.693]  Got all these neocons and establishment guys being kicked out.
[02:47:42.693 --> 02:47:44.794]  But they're kind of now leaving even earlier.
[02:47:44.794 --> 02:47:49.675]  Well, since we're going to be thrown out, we'll just leave now so Democrats can get a majority.
[02:47:49.675 --> 02:47:52.996]  There's a Republican Party sabotage going on right now of Trump.
[02:47:54.073 --> 02:47:57.154]  That's why we've got to be maximally involved right now.
[02:47:57.154 --> 02:47:59.555]  So we're going to go to your calls in a second.
[02:47:59.555 --> 02:48:08.557]  Just briefly, we were going to do a 34-hour broadcast talking about the collapse of America, the globalists are involved in it, but now this whole Russia thing popped up.
[02:48:08.557 --> 02:48:15.379]  If you strike the Russian forces, the Russians say they're going to shoot down the missiles and shoot down the aircraft and then attack the ships.
[02:48:15.379 --> 02:48:17.580]  And the Russians do what they say they're going to do.
[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:18.240]  Then the U.S.
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:18.980]  will retaliate.
[02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:20.381]  Then we're in a full war.
[02:48:20.381 --> 02:48:21.241]  This is a big deal.
[02:48:22.952 --> 02:48:25.735]  And I see some of the liberal media makes jokes.
[02:48:25.735 --> 02:48:29.499]  Oh, you think there'll be a war, huh?
[02:48:29.499 --> 02:48:33.362]  And Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and Google.
[02:48:33.362 --> 02:48:36.786]  I've never seen them blocking our articles and videos.
[02:48:36.786 --> 02:48:42.151]  I was looking at articles we wrote yesterday about the Russians saying it's a false flag and all the evidence at the UN.
[02:48:42.151 --> 02:48:44.834]  You can't even search those as of this morning on Google.
[02:48:46.448 --> 02:48:49.030]  So they're 93% of web searches.
[02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:51.452]  So they are delisting everything.
[02:48:51.452 --> 02:48:55.394]  To the point of my own crew when I got in this morning goes, yeah, we know it's a false flag.
[02:48:55.394 --> 02:48:56.135]  The last three were.
[02:48:56.135 --> 02:48:56.755]  And I go, no, no, no, no.
[02:48:56.755 --> 02:48:57.936]  The Russians say it is.
[02:48:57.936 --> 02:48:59.117]  They have proof.
[02:48:59.117 --> 02:49:02.119]  That's big news any way you slice it.
[02:49:02.119 --> 02:49:06.702]  You can hardly even find Trump saying he's not going to strike Syria or looking at not doing it now.
[02:49:06.702 --> 02:49:07.803]  Or Mattis.
[02:49:07.803 --> 02:49:10.525]  So they are on right now.
[02:49:10.525 --> 02:49:13.147]  The crazy people at Google, Twitter, Facebook.
[02:49:14.574 --> 02:49:20.377]  Trying to block us doing a really good, you know, five plus hours.
[02:49:20.377 --> 02:49:21.597]  David Knight did three hours.
[02:49:21.597 --> 02:49:26.180]  We're about to complete three hours, so almost six hours here.
[02:49:26.180 --> 02:49:33.383]  And you've got Zuckerberg, who's been the king of censoring conservatives and libertarians and having Facebook work for Clinton and openly admitting it.
[02:49:33.383 --> 02:49:37.805]  And then less than 1% of Facebook promoted Trump because that's all he would let.
[02:49:37.805 --> 02:49:42.688]  And they have all these hearings bipartisanly about how we got to block conservatives from the Internet.
[02:49:43.578 --> 02:49:45.500]  Now it's all Russians.
[02:49:45.500 --> 02:49:46.921]  And by the way, I haven't talked about this yet.
[02:49:46.921 --> 02:49:52.146]  Because I was busy on Tuesday and Wednesday when he was testifying.
[02:49:52.146 --> 02:49:53.126]  But I watched some of it.
[02:49:53.126 --> 02:49:54.788]  He looked like a crazy robot.
[02:49:54.788 --> 02:50:00.993]  We were seeing the real Zuckerberg that calls his supporters dumb effers.
[02:50:00.993 --> 02:50:03.596]  When he was talking to them, he would do this, right here.
[02:50:03.596 --> 02:50:05.858]  Here, touch me and I'll show you some of the shots I saw on TV.
[02:50:05.858 --> 02:50:08.000]  Those are kind of bad, but a lot of them were like...
[02:50:10.287 --> 02:50:11.428]  I mean, I can't even do it like him.
[02:50:11.428 --> 02:50:14.950]  It looks so unreal.
[02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:17.472]  I mean, just, wow, you're really seeing who this guy is.
[02:50:17.472 --> 02:50:19.994]  Yeah, look how psychotic he looks.
[02:50:19.994 --> 02:50:26.738]  I mean, that is super, super, super, super, super creepy, man.
[02:50:26.738 --> 02:50:35.184]  And, oh my God, I mean, that guy just reeks of robotic... You see it in British royalty.
[02:50:35.184 --> 02:50:36.945]  It tends to be inbreeding.
[02:50:38.479 --> 02:50:43.190]  And he just has that crazy inbred dog look.
[02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.971]  Very, very dangerous.
[02:50:45.165 --> 02:50:46.986]  We're not funded by the globalists.
[02:50:46.986 --> 02:50:48.007]  We're not data mining.
[02:50:48.007 --> 02:50:49.208]  We're funded by you.
[02:50:49.208 --> 02:50:53.731]  And if you will simply go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the very best air filters, still $50 off.
[02:50:53.731 --> 02:50:58.614]  They told me they were going to sell out of them, but now they have another shipment, but it's got to end in the next couple of days.
[02:50:58.614 --> 02:51:02.236]  50% off the Alexa Pure Breezes that are Ion 4-stage filters.
[02:51:02.236 --> 02:51:03.317]  Leading competitors are $400 to $600 to $800.
[02:51:03.317 --> 02:51:03.717]  These are $199.
[02:51:03.717 --> 02:51:05.318]  Normally they're $149 right now.
[02:51:05.318 --> 02:51:05.419]  $50 off.
[02:51:05.419 --> 02:51:07.060]  Sheikra 12, great vitamin B12, the purest out there.
[02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:08.120]  Has tested by BuzzFeed, even had to admit it.
[02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:08.541]  25% off.
[02:51:15.866 --> 02:51:18.909]  Brainforce, our bestseller.
[02:51:18.909 --> 02:51:23.513]  That cannot be right because they told me it was selling out Monday, but it's still 50% off.
[02:51:23.513 --> 02:51:24.674]  I guess they just never got rid of that.
[02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:26.876]  That just shows how busy I am with news.
[02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:27.817]  We're asleep at the switch here.
[02:51:27.817 --> 02:51:29.519]  I'm not mad, it's just insane.
[02:51:29.519 --> 02:51:32.081]  I'm not just saying, this is our last day, it's our last day, it's our last day.
[02:51:32.742 --> 02:51:34.523]  It's gonna sell out, we don't get more for months.
[02:51:34.523 --> 02:51:36.444]  Why is it still 50% off?
[02:51:36.444 --> 02:51:37.544]  Take it down.
[02:51:37.544 --> 02:51:48.969]  I'm not mad, but I'm not up here just saying the sale's about to end and then a week later it's still up there, because they told me we had like a week left, and more doesn't come in for over a month, so we should sell it at the full price to fund the operation!
[02:51:51.309 --> 02:51:54.991]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[02:51:54.991 --> 02:51:56.912]  We had to end that over the weekend.
[02:51:56.912 --> 02:51:58.133]  I didn't realize it's still up.
[02:51:58.133 --> 02:51:59.494]  It's my fault!
[02:51:59.494 --> 02:52:00.394]  I've been in D.C.
[02:52:00.394 --> 02:52:02.295]  and just all this other insanity.
[02:52:02.295 --> 02:52:06.818]  I got here hours and hours early today to get ready for this broadcast and then I got hit with a bunch of other stuff.
[02:52:06.818 --> 02:52:07.838]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:52:07.838 --> 02:52:08.118]  Whatever.
[02:52:08.118 --> 02:52:10.520]  I'm going to stop complaining.
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:13.801]  The big one you need to know is X2, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:13.801 --> 02:52:15.843]  We may have to come out with a new one down the road.
[02:52:15.843 --> 02:52:17.423]  I don't know if it's going to be the Deep Earth Crystals.
[02:52:17.423 --> 02:52:18.624]  I don't know if they can get that.
[02:52:18.624 --> 02:52:19.945]  Quite frankly, it is the best source.
[02:52:22.034 --> 02:52:26.176]  I believe Group, but I've still spent a year trying to come up with my own.
[02:52:26.176 --> 02:52:29.398]  And Group's just all about people getting good stuff.
[02:52:29.398 --> 02:52:30.858]  He can't find other sources.
[02:52:30.858 --> 02:52:32.659]  The price just went up.
[02:52:32.659 --> 02:52:36.941]  They had to get this during gas drilling and oil drilling at between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[02:52:36.941 --> 02:52:38.702]  The companies just don't want to stop to even get it.
[02:52:40.228 --> 02:52:40.408]  As a
[02:53:01.826 --> 02:53:04.367]  Brain Force is now the number one seller, because it's so popular.
[02:53:04.367 --> 02:53:05.868]  This is the second best seller.
[02:53:05.868 --> 02:53:09.729]  And so there have been a lot of shenanigans trying to stop us having this.
[02:53:09.729 --> 02:53:14.291]  We do have enough for a couple more runs, but those runs cost more money, so the price has got to go up.
[02:53:14.291 --> 02:53:15.552]  But then, I don't know.
[02:53:15.552 --> 02:53:17.453]  To the point of, we're trying to find a new one.
[02:53:18.413 --> 02:53:20.215]  So, there you go.
[02:53:20.215 --> 02:53:27.000]  So, if you want your X-Tube, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:28.401]  It's in the palm oil.
[02:53:28.401 --> 02:53:31.504]  It's injected as a gas into it from deep-earth crystals.
[02:53:31.504 --> 02:53:33.626]  I mean, the crystals are so pure, we show you in the video.
[02:53:33.626 --> 02:53:41.533]  We put them on the table, and they start melting through the table and turning into a purple gas and shooting up into the air, like I Dream of Jeannie.
[02:53:42.581 --> 02:53:44.202]  Yeah, actually here they are getting the crystals out.
[02:53:44.202 --> 02:53:46.043]  I've never even seen this footage.
[02:53:46.043 --> 02:53:47.524]  I've seen the other footage.
[02:53:47.524 --> 02:53:48.825]  We get more and I've seen this footage.
[02:53:48.825 --> 02:53:51.387]  Yeah, yeah, show it, show it on the table.
[02:53:51.387 --> 02:53:54.269]  That is pure iodine.
[02:53:54.269 --> 02:53:55.710]  Pure.
[02:53:55.710 --> 02:53:58.152]  No one else has done this.
[02:53:58.152 --> 02:54:01.674]  But we have the video where you put it on and it turns into purple gas.
[02:54:01.674 --> 02:54:02.354]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, there it is.
[02:54:05.970 --> 02:54:10.093]  That's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why this is so special and so pure.
[02:54:10.093 --> 02:54:11.834]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen.
[02:54:11.834 --> 02:54:16.258]  We also have the Immune Gargle product that's regular iodine, but it's still good.
[02:54:16.258 --> 02:54:19.920]  It's the clean, medical-grade type, but it's not the atomic iodine.
[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:20.781]  Everybody says they have it.
[02:54:20.781 --> 02:54:21.922]  No one has it.
[02:54:21.922 --> 02:54:22.642]  They've tested ours.
[02:54:22.642 --> 02:54:24.724]  They go, oh my God, how'd you get pure atomic iodine?
[02:54:24.724 --> 02:54:25.524]  It is pure.
[02:54:25.524 --> 02:54:30.288]  The stuff we've got is the regular iodine, but in the medical-grade level.
[02:54:30.288 --> 02:54:31.469]  I like the crap you'd buy at, you know,
[02:54:32.089 --> 02:54:33.770]  One of those big drugstores or whatever.
[02:54:33.770 --> 02:54:35.410]  And it's in there with the colloidal silver.
[02:54:35.410 --> 02:54:36.751]  We have it in three different sizes.
[02:54:36.751 --> 02:54:39.472]  That's 50% off as well when you get all three bottles together.
[02:54:39.472 --> 02:54:44.134]  The small one ounce, the three ounce, or what is that, the 16 ounce.
[02:54:44.134 --> 02:54:45.355]  It's all there.
[02:54:45.355 --> 02:54:46.335]  Amazing product.
[02:54:46.335 --> 02:54:47.536]  An immune gargle is a supplement.
[02:54:47.536 --> 02:54:49.056]  You can even swallow it.
[02:54:49.056 --> 02:54:51.917]  You first wash your mouth, brush your teeth, it'll take a little swig for you.
[02:54:51.917 --> 02:54:52.958]  Really, really good for you.
[02:54:52.958 --> 02:54:54.819]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:54:54.819 --> 02:54:55.239]  But this could be.
[02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:02.322]  We should probably add, this could be your last chance.
[02:55:02.322 --> 02:55:04.183]  It's not your last chance.
[02:55:04.183 --> 02:55:07.585]  Because we hope to be selling this in 20 years.
[02:55:07.585 --> 02:55:10.347]  But that's what's going on.
[02:55:10.347 --> 02:55:11.768]  I've been put over a barrel, basically.
[02:55:11.768 --> 02:55:12.348]  Not by group.
[02:55:12.348 --> 02:55:15.991]  I've seen the contracts.
[02:55:15.991 --> 02:55:17.232]  They figured out there's a market.
[02:55:18.817 --> 02:55:24.902]  The Deep Earth Crystals are only used in pharmaceutical production, because there is a market for it, but it's the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:55:24.902 --> 02:55:29.885]  They use it as a precursor in a bunch of stuff that they produce, different types of drugs.
[02:55:29.885 --> 02:55:31.287]  So again, this is the good halogen.
[02:55:31.287 --> 02:55:32.307]  Okay, I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:55:32.307 --> 02:55:34.229]  I promise I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:55:34.229 --> 02:55:36.991]  It's just essential folks support the broadcast.
[02:55:36.991 --> 02:55:38.672]  Alpha Power is back in stock.
[02:55:38.672 --> 02:55:39.133]  Amazing.
[02:55:40.013 --> 02:55:44.500]  Uh, we've got, uh, Bodies, uh, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 25% off, back in stock.
[02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:51.910]  Double Patriot Points this month, so it's not 5% of each dollar, it's 10%, so 10% off on your Patriot Points.

[02:55:56.055 --> 02:55:57.857]  10% off, so that's 20% total.
[02:55:57.857 --> 02:55:59.078]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:55:59.078 --> 02:56:01.940]  But whatever you do, support that local AM or FM station.
[02:56:01.940 --> 02:56:05.162]  Don't take it for granted that you hear us on a local AM or FM station.
[02:56:05.162 --> 02:56:06.183]  Thank the program director.
[02:56:06.183 --> 02:56:07.164]  Thank the owner.
[02:56:07.164 --> 02:56:08.145]  Become a sponsor.
[02:56:08.145 --> 02:56:09.566]  Send them $100 a month.
[02:56:09.566 --> 02:56:15.030]  If people with money don't start spending money in the fight, we can't block Soros.
[02:56:15.030 --> 02:56:17.712]  He thinks he can break the will of everybody.
[02:56:17.712 --> 02:56:21.235]  My gosh, I get on radio stations, get ratings on them after about a year, good ratings.
[02:56:22.418 --> 02:56:26.560]  They come in and pay $500,000.
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:35.024]  Just one example, to take me off local radio here in Austin, they sign a contract of sponsorship pursuant to me being taken off the air.
[02:56:35.024 --> 02:56:36.664]  And it's a multinational corporation.
[02:56:36.664 --> 02:56:38.145]  And it goes on all over the country.
[02:56:38.145 --> 02:56:39.346]  In fact, it's a well-known thing.
[02:56:39.346 --> 02:56:43.167]  Stations put me on, within a year generally they get top ratings or near it.
[02:56:43.167 --> 02:56:44.048]  It's been done all over the country.
[02:56:45.257 --> 02:56:49.482]  ESPN comes in, whoever comes in buys it for three times what it's worth the time.
[02:56:49.482 --> 02:56:55.468]  As soon as I'm off, about in a year they pull it, the station puts me back on, ESPN's back in six months.
[02:56:55.468 --> 02:56:56.569]  So, it's well known.
[02:56:56.569 --> 02:57:01.395]  You put me on, it gets the ratings, they will come to buy me off the station.
[02:57:01.395 --> 02:57:04.638]  So the big joke is, you put me on to get them to come to get money.
[02:57:04.638 --> 02:57:07.001]  I don't care, put me on for six months a year, pull me off.
[02:57:08.382 --> 02:57:09.804]  That's the war level we're at.
[02:57:09.804 --> 02:57:12.827]  But whatever you do, listeners, realize we're in a full war.
[02:57:12.827 --> 02:57:18.413]  We need you to spread the live link, spread the articles, spread the videos that I should do a better job talking about because there's so many of them.
[02:57:18.413 --> 02:57:20.816]  We'll do a few calls when we come back then.
[02:57:20.816 --> 02:57:23.098]  Anthony Comey of Compound Media is coming up.
[02:57:23.098 --> 02:57:24.139]  It's good to know he's out there.
[02:57:24.139 --> 02:57:25.200]  Good to know Drudge is out there.
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:27.043]  Good to know CRTV is out there.
[02:57:27.043 --> 02:57:27.923]  Good to know, uh...
[02:57:29.022 --> 02:57:35.945]  One American Network, all those folks, because it's good to know there's other people out there fighting, because I tell you, man, we're in a war.
[02:57:35.945 --> 02:57:39.026]  And they're trying to start a physical war, as Nigel Farage said earlier.
[02:57:39.026 --> 02:57:40.947]  We'll be back in the 34-hour transmission.
[02:57:40.947 --> 02:57:41.647]  Stay with us.
[02:57:41.647 --> 02:57:42.848]  We're fighting.
[02:57:42.848 --> 02:57:43.468]  Are you fighting?
[02:57:46.308 --> 02:57:51.791]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:57:51.791 --> 02:57:52.631]  I take this.
[02:57:52.631 --> 02:57:53.772]  My family takes this.
[02:57:53.772 --> 02:57:58.054]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:57:58.054 --> 02:58:02.517]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:58:02.657 --> 02:58:07.299]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:58:07.299 --> 02:58:08.419]  I don't feel good.
[02:58:08.419 --> 02:58:12.180]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:58:12.180 --> 02:58:14.881]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:58:14.881 --> 02:58:20.663]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:58:20.663 --> 02:58:23.624]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:58:23.624 --> 02:58:27.165]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:58:27.165 --> 02:58:29.406]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:58:29.406 --> 02:58:29.766]  I love it.
[02:58:29.926 --> 02:58:32.709]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:58:32.709 --> 02:58:33.730]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:33.730 --> 02:58:39.555]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:39.555 --> 02:58:41.577]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:58:41.577 --> 02:58:42.798]  It's a win-win.
[02:58:42.798 --> 02:58:43.779]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:46.434 --> 02:59:05.266]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[02:59:05.606 --> 02:59:06.406]  The revolution.
[02:59:06.406 --> 02:59:08.507]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:59:08.507 --> 02:59:12.508]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:12.508 --> 02:59:19.771]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:59:19.771 --> 02:59:22.151]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:59:22.151 --> 02:59:24.792]  We've got the best mouthwash signed by Dr. Jones.
[02:59:24.792 --> 02:59:27.593]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:59:27.593 --> 02:59:29.154]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:29.154 --> 02:59:30.734]  And you're purchasing the products
[02:59:33.835 --> 02:59:39.257]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:59:39.257 --> 02:59:49.240]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:59:49.240 --> 02:59:55.922]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.922 --> 03:00:03.204]  Yeah, don't fear the Reaper unless there's a nuclear war and we all get killed.
[03:00:04.881 --> 03:00:11.866]  I don't fear death, but I fear death of the planet, death of the species, and our great quest failing.
[03:00:11.866 --> 03:00:14.067]  Yeah, I'm pro-human, not a globalist.
[03:00:14.067 --> 03:00:17.129]  I like myself, so I project that on other people.
[03:00:17.129 --> 03:00:20.752]  Anthony Comey is coming up, riding a shotgun with me during the 34-hour global transmission.
[03:00:20.752 --> 03:00:21.973]  We're now six hours into.
[03:00:21.973 --> 03:00:24.074]  Steve in West Virginia, you're a trooper.
[03:00:24.074 --> 03:00:25.475]  Thank you for holding so long.
[03:00:25.475 --> 03:00:26.235]  God bless you.
[03:00:26.235 --> 03:00:26.716]  You're on the air.
[03:00:29.085 --> 03:00:32.607]  Yeah Alex, them globalists and deep state, they need a war.
[03:00:32.607 --> 03:00:35.850]  It's not about gas, or money, or oil.
[03:00:35.850 --> 03:00:39.692]  It's about patriotism and Christianity.
[03:00:39.692 --> 03:00:44.916]  When Putin said he was moving out of Syria, they had a gas attack there in Salisbury.
[03:00:44.916 --> 03:00:48.358]  Trump says he's pulling out, another gas attack.
[03:00:48.358 --> 03:00:51.080]  Who do you think these countries a hollow war all the time?
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:55.403]  Are they going to send them tens of millions of refugees?
[03:00:55.403 --> 03:00:58.185]  Muslim immigrants, are they going to be one fight in the battle?
[03:00:58.621 --> 03:00:59.242]  We're good to go.
[03:01:14.488 --> 03:01:17.550]  And the patriots, take a walk all over this world.
[03:01:17.550 --> 03:01:19.451]  Well, did you hear Nigel Farage earlier?
[03:01:19.451 --> 03:01:20.292]  What a great leader.
[03:01:20.292 --> 03:01:24.575]  And what a great person that sees into the future.
[03:01:24.575 --> 03:01:25.835]  A seer.
[03:01:25.835 --> 03:01:29.018]  He said they want to destroy Christians, period.
[03:01:29.018 --> 03:01:30.418]  And that's Russia's crime.
[03:01:30.418 --> 03:01:32.880]  The left loved Russia!
[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:37.323]  Because they could go over there and literally take holidays and kill Christians in cages.
[03:01:37.323 --> 03:01:38.224]  And now they can't do it.
[03:01:38.224 --> 03:01:38.744]  They hate it.
[03:01:38.744 --> 03:01:39.725]  Hollywood hates it.
[03:01:39.725 --> 03:01:40.345]  The left hates it.
[03:01:40.345 --> 03:01:41.646]  They can't go have their honeymoons there now.
[03:01:42.605 --> 03:01:45.287]  Well, that's because Russia's the one that got away!
[03:02:11.397 --> 03:02:20.399]  The left took it over, killed millions of Russians, used Russia to kill tens of millions more, and man, they gang-raped that country and gouged those Christians' eyes out and starved them to death good.
[03:02:20.399 --> 03:02:32.702]  All those Commissars, massive Lincoln Brigades, Abraham Lincoln Brigades, went over there to have fun and get to torture Christians, and now their big torture factory's been taken over, and they just are so mad Russia came back.
[03:02:32.702 --> 03:02:33.922]  God bless you, Steve.
[03:02:33.922 --> 03:02:34.602]  Great points.
[03:02:34.602 --> 03:02:37.243]  James in Louisiana, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:02:37.243 --> 03:02:39.524]  Then another James in Spokane, Washington.
[03:02:39.524 --> 03:02:40.784]  James in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[03:02:45.325 --> 03:02:46.666]  James in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[03:02:46.666 --> 03:02:47.966]  Go ahead.
[03:02:47.966 --> 03:02:49.007]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:49.007 --> 03:02:49.968]  Hi there.
[03:02:49.968 --> 03:02:55.771]  I just want to start off saying, man, the iodine, man, worked wonders.
[03:02:55.771 --> 03:02:56.851]  Lost a lot of weight.
[03:02:56.851 --> 03:03:00.914]  Just started back working out, man.
[03:03:00.914 --> 03:03:03.455]  It got me healthy.
[03:03:03.455 --> 03:03:11.359]  But I want to talk about flushing the gators out of the swamp, man.
[03:03:14.833 --> 03:03:19.234]  I think the next move would be to hit them from a different side.
[03:03:19.234 --> 03:03:35.238]  I remember whenever they had shot, they came out on CNN, the CIA black project thing coming out with the UFO video and everything.
[03:03:35.238 --> 03:03:40.159]  The fact is, they had admitted that that technology does exist.
[03:03:41.592 --> 03:03:44.973]  Could that be enough angle that we can hit them on?
[03:03:44.973 --> 03:03:45.653]  Absolutely!
[03:03:45.653 --> 03:03:47.694]  I mean, there's all sorts of stuff we can hit them on.
[03:03:47.694 --> 03:03:50.275]  People going out and telling Bill Clinton he's a rapist everywhere he goes.
[03:03:50.275 --> 03:03:53.356]  Or Comey, when he goes on the road at signing books.
[03:03:53.356 --> 03:03:56.017]  Everybody should confront him, videotape it, and shut him down.
[03:03:56.017 --> 03:03:57.137]  You taking action.
[03:03:57.137 --> 03:04:00.058]  You getting in the street, but not like communists beating people up.
[03:04:00.058 --> 03:04:05.720]  Going to events, going to book signings, getting on C-SPAN, taking over the media, calling in to talk radio.
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:06.760]  You have the power.
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:07.601]  They fear you.
[03:04:07.601 --> 03:04:08.861]  It's why they fear this broadcast.
[03:04:09.963 --> 03:04:15.240]  Yes sir, and then the fact that Trump's uncle had
[03:04:16.055 --> 03:04:22.417]  I was able to look at Nikola Tesla's papers after he had died.
[03:04:22.417 --> 03:04:25.477]  Yeah, no, Trump knows a lot about the secret technology, absolutely.
[03:04:25.477 --> 03:04:30.879]  He knows about globalism, and we'll see what happens because he's starting to go sideways, but we're praying he wakes up.
[03:04:30.879 --> 03:04:31.579]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:31.579 --> 03:04:32.339]  Thank you, James, Louisiana.
[03:04:32.339 --> 03:04:33.339]  We've got James in Spokane.
[03:04:33.339 --> 03:04:34.679]  I'll get to you, too.
[03:04:34.679 --> 03:04:36.140]  But Anthony Cumia is coming up.
[03:04:36.140 --> 03:04:37.440]  He's going to be hosting this hour.
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:40.461]  I'm going to finish up on Robert Mueller with him and get his take on that.
[03:04:40.461 --> 03:04:42.981]  And then a war with Owen Schroyer.
[03:04:42.981 --> 03:04:44.742]  So many other big guests throughout the next
[03:04:45.342 --> 03:04:49.689]  Well now it's 27 hours, or 28, yeah, 28 hours that are left.
[03:04:49.689 --> 03:04:53.335]  In the global transmission, stop war with Russia, global emergency broadcast.
[03:04:54.795 --> 03:04:55.595]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:55.595 --> 03:05:05.739]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:05.739 --> 03:05:14.243]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:14.243 --> 03:05:23.026]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:25.114 --> 03:05:44.720]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:47.400]  It is amazing!
[03:05:47.400 --> 03:05:52.362]  Red Pilt, now available at m4warsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:06:00.945 --> 03:06:07.009]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.009 --> 03:06:12.793]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[03:06:12.793 --> 03:06:18.477]  Something you call love, but confess.
[03:06:18.477 --> 03:06:23.961]  You've been a messin', well you shouldn't have been a messin'.
[03:06:23.961 --> 03:06:27.504]  And now someone else is gettin' all your best.
[03:06:30.221 --> 03:06:36.364]  There's a very powerful video that's going to be posted on YouTube and Facebook in the next 10 minutes.
[03:06:36.364 --> 03:06:37.685]  He was on with us two hours ago.
[03:06:37.685 --> 03:06:39.966]  Nigel Farage.
[03:06:39.966 --> 03:06:42.968]  The globalists want war with Russia.
[03:06:42.968 --> 03:06:45.809]  Well, it's even worse than that, the headline is.
[03:06:45.809 --> 03:06:47.110]  Nigel Farage.
[03:06:47.110 --> 03:06:54.874]  The globalists hate Christians, want war with Russia.
[03:06:54.874 --> 03:06:57.655]  And they hate Christians because they want to be God.
[03:06:59.571 --> 03:07:00.972]  They want total control.
[03:07:00.972 --> 03:07:02.293]  They want total power.
[03:07:02.293 --> 03:07:07.696]  And they want radical Islam as their operating system.
[03:07:07.696 --> 03:07:07.856]  Now...
[03:07:09.045 --> 03:07:12.027]  Joining us is the fellow that hosts every couple of weeks.
[03:07:12.027 --> 03:07:16.950]  He has his own great media operation, compoundmedia.com, at the Cumia Show on Twitter.
[03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:22.313]  And he's got a lot to cover today, but I got behind, and he always invites me on, so I appreciate it.
[03:07:22.313 --> 03:07:32.460]  And I wanted to get his take on Mueller, because we've been focused on the neocons around World War III with Russia, and Pompeo saying, we've already killed hundreds of Russians, and thought that he wouldn't help us take out ISIS.
[03:07:33.319 --> 03:07:35.982]  I wanted to play these clips and get your take on it.
[03:07:35.982 --> 03:07:41.529]  First, we've got Rand Paul warns Mueller's enormous power can be used against anybody.
[03:07:41.529 --> 03:07:43.912]  Yeah, who died and made him king of the universe?
[03:07:43.912 --> 03:07:47.737]  Let's play that clip and then a few others to get Anthony Comey's take on this.
[03:07:47.737 --> 03:07:48.117]  Here it is.
[03:07:49.113 --> 03:07:52.355]  So I think this investigation no longer has much to do with Russia.
[03:07:52.355 --> 03:07:56.957]  But I would warn people around America who say, oh, they don't like the president.
[03:07:56.957 --> 03:07:59.619]  Oh, this is just fine because it's against President Trump.
[03:07:59.619 --> 03:08:02.761]  This is an enormous power that can be used against anybody.
[03:08:02.761 --> 03:08:04.922]  You remember what Chuck Schumer said a couple of months ago?
[03:08:04.922 --> 03:08:10.305]  He says, if you cross the intelligence agencies, they can screw you six ways to Sunday.
[03:08:10.865 --> 03:08:16.932]  This is about enormous power, prosecutorial power, but also power in the intelligence communities.
[03:08:16.932 --> 03:08:23.499]  We have to reign this in or every American citizen is exposed to this kind of abuse of power.
[03:08:23.499 --> 03:08:24.460]  How would you reign it in?
[03:08:24.460 --> 03:08:28.404]  If you fire Mueller, you have a major political crisis on your hands.
[03:08:29.185 --> 03:08:30.105]  It's hard now.
[03:08:30.105 --> 03:08:30.525]  You're right.
[03:08:30.525 --> 03:08:32.847]  It's actually hard politically to fire Mueller.
[03:08:32.847 --> 03:08:40.272]  But the thing is we never should have had Mueller in the first place because we've given too much power to a prosecutor who's no longer looking at Russia.
[03:08:40.272 --> 03:08:43.934]  He's looking at some kind of personal dealings with the president's lawyer.
[03:08:43.934 --> 03:08:49.478]  And imagine once they get this, they've got all of the information that the president has ever discussed with the attorney.
[03:08:49.478 --> 03:08:53.281]  And they say, oh, we're not going to use the stuff that's attorney-client privilege.
[03:08:53.281 --> 03:08:54.762]  But they're going to read it.
[03:08:54.762 --> 03:08:57.964]  And you think once they've read it, it might give them ideas of other places.
[03:08:58.404 --> 03:08:59.285]  Let's stop right there.
[03:08:59.285 --> 03:09:01.367]  By the way, that's totally illegal.
[03:09:01.367 --> 03:09:08.213]  To go after the lawyer to begin with is cooked up, but I was reading the law to look at the stuff is illegal.
[03:09:08.213 --> 03:09:08.994]  They're doing it all.
[03:09:08.994 --> 03:09:14.900]  These are cornered rat criminals caught in bed with Russia, China, you name it, that hate the country.
[03:09:14.900 --> 03:09:15.881]  They're cornered rats.
[03:09:15.881 --> 03:09:20.245]  I mean, Mueller used to deliver uranium to the Russians on tarmacs in Moscow.
[03:09:20.245 --> 03:09:21.466]  It's like Hitler
[03:09:22.467 --> 03:09:26.049]  Is like trying Netanyahu for being anti-Israel.
[03:09:26.049 --> 03:09:27.989]  Mueller's Hitler, Trump's Netanyahu.
[03:09:27.989 --> 03:09:31.531]  And that's how, remember Hank Williams Jr.
[03:09:31.531 --> 03:09:36.793]  said, such and such with Obama, you know, Obama and Israel's like Hitler and Netanyahu.
[03:09:36.793 --> 03:09:38.514]  And he got fired off Monday Night Football.
[03:09:38.514 --> 03:09:41.595]  That's how crazy this is.
[03:09:41.595 --> 03:09:43.836]  And then, of course, Alan Dershowitz makes the same point.
[03:09:43.836 --> 03:09:44.616]  He's a Democrat.
[03:09:44.616 --> 03:09:47.798]  Mueller is committing subterfuge and is dangerous.
[03:09:47.798 --> 03:09:48.298]  Here's that clip.
[03:09:49.212 --> 03:09:52.674]  What we're seeing is a bifurcation of the investigation.
[03:09:52.674 --> 03:10:14.330]  I think Mueller has now acknowledged that he doesn't have the authority to look into Mr. Donald Trump's pre-presidential activities, and so he's filtered that off and given that to the Southern District of New York, which is now going to investigate those aspects, because apparently they couldn't find anything substantial when it comes to the president's exercise of his Article 2 authority.
[03:10:14.330 --> 03:10:15.551]  The president had the right to fire
[03:10:16.071 --> 03:10:16.452]  It seems.
[03:10:39.711 --> 03:10:44.174]  Uh, doesn't have the authority, so he gives it to somebody else, gives them the information.
[03:10:44.174 --> 03:10:47.017]  It's like laundering information to another prosecutor.
[03:10:47.017 --> 03:10:47.937]  Let's stop right there.
[03:10:47.937 --> 03:10:51.640]  Yeah, it's parallel construction, because they were already legally spying on Trump.
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:53.341]  We didn't elect a saint.
[03:10:53.341 --> 03:10:56.303]  He never said, I don't like hot women.
[03:10:56.303 --> 03:10:59.085]  We want him to do what he says he'll do politically, and he's delivered 98% on that.
[03:11:01.374 --> 03:11:02.815]  This is so dangerous.
[03:11:02.815 --> 03:11:05.856]  The cancer has now metastasized, just like we knew it would.
[03:11:05.856 --> 03:11:09.818]  Roger Stones will be on the War Room later, breaking down all... He predicted all this.
[03:11:09.818 --> 03:11:11.859]  Anthony Cooney, I've got a few other clips you're taking over.
[03:11:11.859 --> 03:11:12.779]  We really appreciate you.
[03:11:12.779 --> 03:11:15.701]  By the way, you're welcome to pop in during the rest of the 34-hour broadcast.
[03:11:15.701 --> 03:11:17.922]  We'd love to get you on my show routinely.
[03:11:17.922 --> 03:11:19.982]  I ran into a couple of your fans while I was in D.C.
[03:11:19.982 --> 03:11:20.603]  and at the airport.
[03:11:21.658 --> 03:11:23.540]  This is just a freaking nightmare.
[03:11:23.540 --> 03:11:26.343]  I mean, Rosenstein's a Clinton operative.
[03:11:26.343 --> 03:11:27.764]  He creates this guy.
[03:11:27.764 --> 03:11:29.927]  They change the power structure.
[03:11:29.927 --> 03:11:32.149]  Then they say, oh, better not fire us.
[03:11:32.149 --> 03:11:34.772]  And now they've metastasized it to all these other places.
[03:11:34.772 --> 03:11:38.676]  And they're looking at bimbos that the president might have boinked 11 years ago.
[03:11:38.676 --> 03:11:39.557]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:11:41.242 --> 03:11:42.343]  I can't believe.
[03:11:42.343 --> 03:11:43.984]  Look, I'm not special.
[03:11:43.984 --> 03:11:50.847]  I don't have this special vision to see these shenanigans, if I may say, going on.
[03:11:50.847 --> 03:11:52.248]  But I see them.
[03:11:52.248 --> 03:11:55.169]  Who can't see what is going on?
[03:11:55.169 --> 03:12:00.392]  This is a concerted effort to take down a democratically elected president.
[03:12:00.792 --> 03:12:03.534]  There's no other motive going on here.
[03:12:03.534 --> 03:12:06.835]  You could call it a fishing expedition, a witch hunt, all those things.
[03:12:06.835 --> 03:12:12.738]  This is so much more nefarious than those fun-loving terms.
[03:12:12.738 --> 03:12:14.459]  It's a coup, isn't it?
[03:12:14.459 --> 03:12:15.720]  It is a coup.
[03:12:15.720 --> 03:12:19.962]  This is when Trump's lawyer's office gets raided.
[03:12:20.703 --> 03:12:22.365]  By the FBI.
[03:12:22.365 --> 03:12:24.107]  And they have a warrant.
[03:12:24.107 --> 03:12:26.690]  These warrants are supposed to be specific.
[03:12:26.690 --> 03:12:28.692]  What crime was committed?
[03:12:28.692 --> 03:12:38.463]  Why did they give them a warrant to go into a lawyer's office, infringe that sacred right of client lawyer privilege?
[03:12:39.183 --> 03:12:42.364]  And, and, and search for something.
[03:12:42.364 --> 03:12:44.105]  What are they looking for?
[03:12:44.105 --> 03:12:51.648]  What did they have that they gave to a judge that gave them the ability to search a lawyer's office?
[03:12:51.648 --> 03:12:56.149]  That is a real bond, a sacred bond.
[03:12:56.149 --> 03:13:00.751]  That violates two different amendments to the first 10 Bill of Rights, but expanding on that.
[03:13:01.511 --> 03:13:02.473]  Parallel construction.
[03:13:02.473 --> 03:13:03.975]  These agencies use illegal surveillance.
[03:13:03.975 --> 03:13:04.716]  They've already got it.
[03:13:04.716 --> 03:13:08.822]  It came out in documents a year ago that I was being surveilled six years ago, and so was Trump.
[03:13:08.822 --> 03:13:11.546]  The DEA leaked that through Sheriff Arpaio.
[03:13:11.546 --> 03:13:12.868]  This is parallel construction.
[03:13:12.868 --> 03:13:15.191]  It has nothing to do with the original investigation.
[03:13:15.191 --> 03:13:16.753]  But you know, Trump is smarter than that.
[03:13:16.753 --> 03:13:17.655]  He never did anything wrong.
[03:13:18.115 --> 03:13:18.835]  But of course.
[03:13:18.835 --> 03:13:20.476]  Did they take care of some women or whatever?
[03:13:20.476 --> 03:13:21.036]  Yeah.
[03:13:21.036 --> 03:13:22.317]  Well, we know he's not a freaking saint.
[03:13:22.317 --> 03:13:23.738]  He ran a beauty contest.
[03:13:23.738 --> 03:13:26.059]  His crime is he's not a pedophile or something.
[03:13:26.059 --> 03:13:28.740]  And so what's really going on here is parallel construction.
[03:13:28.740 --> 03:13:31.801]  I think Trump is smart enough to know his whole operation was under surveillance.
[03:13:31.801 --> 03:13:34.703]  And whatever stuff they're trying to twist, I have a feeling is long gone.
[03:13:35.874 --> 03:13:37.014]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:13:37.014 --> 03:13:37.874]  I would hope so.
[03:13:37.874 --> 03:13:42.535]  Trump does come off as a smart guy when it comes to this kind of stuff.
[03:13:42.535 --> 03:13:45.996]  He won't fall into a lot of their traps that they're setting up.
[03:13:45.996 --> 03:13:48.377]  And that's exactly what this is.
[03:13:48.377 --> 03:13:56.658]  When Chuck Schumer the other day said that the President doesn't have the right or the ability to fire Mueller, I don't think he should.
[03:13:56.658 --> 03:13:57.799]  I think that'd be a huge mistake politically.
[03:13:57.799 --> 03:13:58.779]  But he does have the right.
[03:13:59.039 --> 03:13:59.579]  He does have the right.
[03:13:59.579 --> 03:14:00.660]  But he does have the right!
[03:14:00.660 --> 03:14:01.400]  Who's Mueller?
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:01.861]  What is he?
[03:14:01.861 --> 03:14:05.763]  He's higher than the President of the United States.
[03:14:05.763 --> 03:14:08.665]  And even the President doesn't have the ability to fire this guy?
[03:14:08.665 --> 03:14:13.968]  He could do anything he wants, search, wire... Oh, I said months ago, he's like Emperor Mueller.
[03:14:13.968 --> 03:14:14.929]  He's like God.
[03:14:14.929 --> 03:14:16.010]  He just does whatever he wants.
[03:14:16.650 --> 03:14:26.453]  He can do whatever he wants and you're not seeing anybody budging on trying to tame this guy down.
[03:14:26.453 --> 03:14:32.494]  Look, get through the investigation, whatever it is, but it's at the point where it's so obvious what this is.
[03:14:32.494 --> 03:14:34.415]  This is no longer an investigation.
[03:14:34.415 --> 03:14:35.355]  It's a coup d'etat.
[03:14:35.575 --> 03:14:36.356]  You're absolutely right.
[03:14:36.356 --> 03:14:37.137]  Let's go out to break.
[03:14:37.137 --> 03:14:37.837]  You're taking over.
[03:14:37.837 --> 03:14:40.860]  Anthony Comey of compoundmedia.com is here on fire.
[03:14:40.860 --> 03:14:43.683]  Let's play Whoopi Goldberg licking her lips like Bayar.
[03:14:43.683 --> 03:14:45.505]  Oh, Flynn says he's a Russian agent.
[03:14:45.505 --> 03:14:46.446]  Trump's going to prison.
[03:14:46.446 --> 03:14:47.327]  None of that was true.
[03:14:47.327 --> 03:14:49.128]  Here's Goldberg licking her lips.
[03:14:49.128 --> 03:14:50.670]  Oh, let's bring down the American recovery.
[03:14:50.670 --> 03:14:51.671]  Let's arrest Trump.
[03:14:51.671 --> 03:14:52.712]  Oh, let's have riots.
[03:14:53.012 --> 03:15:01.839]  Exactly what documents show Obama and Soros wanted to suspend the election, but you failed, and you'll fail again, and we have separate powers in government.
[03:15:01.839 --> 03:15:03.160]  They can't arrest the president.
[03:15:03.160 --> 03:15:06.963]  They can't do it, dummies, unless we impeach him, and America is too smart.
[03:15:06.963 --> 03:15:07.623]  I believe.
[03:15:07.623 --> 03:15:07.924]  Here it is.
[03:15:08.848 --> 03:15:12.231]  Everything you're saying about what would happen if he does fire Mueller.
[03:15:12.231 --> 03:15:14.773]  I've said, Lindsey Graham has said it's political suicide.
[03:15:14.773 --> 03:15:18.777]  I 100% think there would be, I think there would actually be rioting in Washington, D.C.
[03:15:18.777 --> 03:15:21.279]  I think it would be at levels we haven't seen.
[03:15:21.279 --> 03:15:22.059]  I have to say.
[03:15:22.059 --> 03:15:27.284]  Yeah, I mean, but I think it would take levels that we can't comprehend since the Nixon era.
[03:15:27.284 --> 03:15:29.105]  And I don't think we should get too far ahead.
[03:15:33.004 --> 03:15:34.505]  Can you imagine they want a civil war?
[03:15:34.505 --> 03:15:36.746]  Rob Reiner says it's a civil war.
[03:15:36.746 --> 03:15:41.848]  And they're there pushing, the Democrats always hate the FBI like Mueller is God.
[03:15:41.848 --> 03:15:43.089]  Anthony Comey is straight ahead.
[03:15:43.089 --> 03:15:46.050]  Then the war room with Owen Schroer as part of the 34-hour transmission.

[03:15:59.713 --> 03:16:05.035]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[03:16:05.035 --> 03:16:10.717]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.717 --> 03:16:14.159]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[03:17:57.918 --> 03:18:04.982]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:18:04.982 --> 03:18:09.746]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:18:09.746 --> 03:18:10.486]  It's very simple.
[03:18:10.486 --> 03:18:12.988]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[03:18:12.988 --> 03:18:14.929]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.

[03:18:31.060 --> 03:18:34.903]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[03:18:34.903 --> 03:18:38.785]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:18:38.785 --> 03:18:41.947]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:18:41.947 --> 03:18:45.590]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.

[03:20:09.387 --> 03:20:10.608]  You found it.
[03:20:10.608 --> 03:20:12.649]  The tip of the spear.
[03:20:12.649 --> 03:20:17.691]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Anthony Cumia.
[03:20:20.897 --> 03:20:21.618]  Welcome!
[03:20:21.618 --> 03:20:26.080]  Anthony Acumia in here at InfoWars.com.
[03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:27.281]  Wow, we're still here.
[03:20:27.281 --> 03:20:28.022]  Isn't it amazing?
[03:20:28.022 --> 03:20:30.483]  We haven't blown up yet.
[03:20:30.483 --> 03:20:40.869]  It really is interesting being here, because I'm broadcasting from New York City, which, wow, there's what you call a primary target.
[03:20:40.869 --> 03:20:44.151]  So, you know, I don't have a hope in the world.
[03:20:44.151 --> 03:20:47.093]  If I got notification that missiles were en route,
[03:20:48.971 --> 03:20:58.145]  I guess I'd have a drink, hang out, wax fantastic about the old days with a few friends for nine minutes, and that would be that.
[03:20:58.145 --> 03:21:03.113]  I mean, I can't remember, and I was a child during the Cold War days.
[03:21:04.486 --> 03:21:09.247]  Back in the late 60s, early 70s.
[03:21:09.247 --> 03:21:13.068]  And I remember how terrifying it was.
[03:21:13.068 --> 03:21:19.770]  Every so often, you'd think, like, hey, there's a lot of missiles pointing at us right now.
[03:21:19.770 --> 03:21:22.071]  Just right there, right now, pointing at us.
[03:21:22.071 --> 03:21:23.591]  Just a bunch of missiles.
[03:21:23.591 --> 03:21:27.872]  And it would freak you out as a kid, a little bit.
[03:21:27.872 --> 03:21:31.173]  And as time went on, and things simmered down,
[03:21:32.709 --> 03:21:34.290]  Everybody kind of relaxed.
[03:21:34.290 --> 03:21:49.158]  We let out a little refreshing sigh of relief after the Berlin Wall came down and Perestroika and Gorbachev talking with Reagan.
[03:21:49.158 --> 03:21:54.420]  It just all seemed to get a lot calmer.
[03:21:54.420 --> 03:21:59.743]  There wasn't that impending doom that, as a child, just having a piano
[03:22:00.695 --> 03:22:12.922]  Strung over your head by a thin little wire that was... Everything that was taking place was done by people you didn't know and you didn't know what they were doing to keep you safe.
[03:22:12.922 --> 03:22:22.448]  You find out years later things like the Cuban Missile Crisis and other very close calls that we had over the course of the Cold War and it was frightening.
[03:22:24.440 --> 03:22:34.046]  But living through that, and that type of fear and anxiety, I gotta tell ya, it's back!
[03:22:34.046 --> 03:22:35.686]  It is back!
[03:22:35.686 --> 03:22:37.728]  Right now!
[03:22:37.728 --> 03:22:46.152]  I am not very confident about this Syria thing.
[03:22:46.152 --> 03:22:49.714]  I honestly don't think we should be involved in this.
[03:22:49.714 --> 03:22:52.956]  In that we were involved with getting rid of ISIS.
[03:22:54.671 --> 03:22:56.652]  That's good.
[03:22:56.652 --> 03:23:01.634]  We had an enemy there and we knew where they were.
[03:23:01.634 --> 03:23:02.734]  We knew what they were doing.
[03:23:02.734 --> 03:23:07.896]  They were a direct threat to us, the United States of America.
[03:23:07.896 --> 03:23:09.517]  Direct threat.
[03:23:09.517 --> 03:23:17.060]  So we had to take care of business and Trump, one of Trump's campaign promises, was indeed taking care of ISIS.
[03:23:17.060 --> 03:23:19.381]  And he has made good on that promise.
[03:23:19.381 --> 03:23:21.001]  They are decimated.
[03:23:21.001 --> 03:23:22.182]  They are almost crushed.
[03:23:23.999 --> 03:23:26.641]  And again, from what we're being told.
[03:23:26.641 --> 03:23:33.305]  That's always taken with somewhat of a grain of salt, even if it's from somebody you do respect and believe in.
[03:23:33.305 --> 03:23:35.846]  But that was the mission.
[03:23:35.846 --> 03:23:49.595]  Now, we see some children, and they've apparently been gassed by Assad's regime in Syria, and then that's our signal to swoop in!
[03:23:50.618 --> 03:23:53.119]  And save the children.
[03:23:53.119 --> 03:23:55.361]  It's always presented that way.
[03:23:55.361 --> 03:24:04.185]  We must save these poor children from Assad and chlorine gas and nerve agents and everything.
[03:24:04.185 --> 03:24:10.869]  And last I heard, no one knows who the hell did this, if indeed it was done.
[03:24:10.869 --> 03:24:14.351]  I know Mad Dog Mattis has come out publicly and said,
[03:24:15.433 --> 03:24:26.475]  That he does believe indeed there was a gas used against people, but nobody has had a definitive answer as to who did this.
[03:24:26.475 --> 03:24:32.217]  And we are already, this went from, mind you, let's do a little, let's backtrack a little.
[03:24:32.217 --> 03:24:34.237]  Oh, we don't have to backtrack far.
[03:24:34.237 --> 03:24:37.158]  Just a few days, as a matter of fact.
[03:24:37.158 --> 03:24:43.239]  Donald Trump, President Trump said, wow, we really should pull out of Syria at some point.
[03:24:43.775 --> 03:24:47.337]  We've done very well against ISIS.
[03:24:47.337 --> 03:24:58.021]  Once the job is done there, I'd like to pull our troops out and cease our operations in Syria.
[03:24:58.021 --> 03:25:06.245]  Well, almost immediately, suspiciously quick, there was a gas attack in Syria.
[03:25:06.245 --> 03:25:11.627]  As if somebody doesn't want us to leave Syria.
[03:25:11.627 --> 03:25:12.788]  Again, who that is?
[03:25:14.858 --> 03:25:17.099]  I don't know.
[03:25:17.099 --> 03:25:20.880]  But that was the chain of events almost immediately.
[03:25:20.880 --> 03:25:24.921]  And it goes from that to now us gearing up.
[03:25:24.921 --> 03:25:27.302]  We got carrier groups moving.
[03:25:27.302 --> 03:25:37.004]  We got Donald Trump, President Trump tweeting about what sounds to be imminent attacks on somewhere in Syria.
[03:25:37.004 --> 03:25:38.945]  Again, who the hell knows?
[03:25:38.945 --> 03:25:39.965]  Who, where, what?
[03:25:41.306 --> 03:25:44.449]  And of course, the Russia angle on the whole thing.
[03:25:44.449 --> 03:25:47.552]  Now he's saying, I never said an attack on Syria would take place.
[03:25:47.552 --> 03:25:50.075]  Could be very soon or not soon at all!
[03:25:50.075 --> 03:25:56.021]  In any event, the United States, under my administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS.
[03:25:56.021 --> 03:25:57.903]  Where is our thank you, America?
[03:25:59.946 --> 03:26:03.427]  It's always a treat reading Donald's tweets.
[03:26:03.427 --> 03:26:12.770]  But yeah, now he's had to dial back his initial tweet that said, the missiles are coming.
[03:26:12.770 --> 03:26:15.970]  They're new, they're beautiful, they're smart.
[03:26:15.970 --> 03:26:17.991]  And you know, that seemed like a very
[03:26:19.481 --> 03:26:48.290]  ominous uh... absolute that we would be uh... engaging in some type of military activity over there in syria now there are a lot of russians a lot of iranians over there in syria uh... doing their own thing over there uh... that puts a lot of people in danger now you might remember after the last gas attack uh... the president lobbed in some uh... cruise missiles took uh... out a couple of runways which were put back in operation almost immediately
[03:26:49.585 --> 03:26:52.147]  There were some deaths.
[03:26:52.147 --> 03:26:53.648]  And again, Russians are over there.
[03:26:53.648 --> 03:27:08.156]  Now, if we have to again send cruise missiles and then back that up with some manned aircraft, this puts our pilots in danger of being downed by Russians.
[03:27:09.190 --> 03:27:21.953]  Now, I don't know about you, but that sounds like a terrible escalation of events if Russia is now downing our aircraft and killing our pilots.
[03:27:21.953 --> 03:27:24.793]  How would we have to react to that?
[03:27:24.793 --> 03:27:38.096]  One of the scariest prospects of the whole thing is the fact that every single person that has been against every single thing Donald Trump has done since the election isn't against this.
[03:27:39.634 --> 03:27:52.963]  Donald Trump is talking about military action in Syria and the left isn't clamoring for his impeachment on this, asking him to stop saying it's crazy and ridiculous and this.
[03:27:52.963 --> 03:28:02.409]  They go from he's Putin's puppet to this is an insane escalation of events.
[03:28:02.409 --> 03:28:06.451]  Anything Donald Trump does in their eyes is a terrible thing.
[03:28:06.451 --> 03:28:08.933]  But doesn't it kind of look to you like
[03:28:09.924 --> 03:28:19.547]  Someone out there, or an entity out there, a collection of people, a consortium of people, want a war?
[03:28:19.547 --> 03:28:28.070]  And perhaps the biggest one of them all, the one, you know, the second half of the 20th century was based on.
[03:28:28.070 --> 03:28:32.251]  The two big kids on the block duking it out.
[03:28:32.251 --> 03:28:36.993]  And yes, believe me, once one side starts losing a conventional war, oh,
[03:28:37.685 --> 03:28:40.106]  We're glowing in the dark, people.
[03:28:40.106 --> 03:28:48.149]  And I must tell you, it wouldn't be a good thing, regardless of what your ideology is.
[03:28:48.149 --> 03:28:49.270]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:28:49.270 --> 03:28:50.010]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:50.010 --> 03:28:51.491]  Anthony Cumia, InfoWars.com.
[03:28:53.226 --> 03:28:55.088]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:29:59.865 --> 03:30:00.726]  It'd take hours.

[03:30:03.168 --> 03:30:04.349]  It's stronger.
[03:30:04.349 --> 03:30:05.950]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:30:05.950 --> 03:30:09.173]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.

[03:30:10.294 --> 03:30:13.476]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.

[03:30:17.299 --> 03:30:17.459]  I think?
[03:30:35.979 --> 03:30:37.982]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[03:30:37.982 --> 03:30:39.364]  Without you, we couldn't do it.

[03:30:53.763 --> 03:30:57.367]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:30:57.367 --> 03:30:59.129]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:30:59.129 --> 03:31:10.400]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:31:11.181 --> 03:31:20.366]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:31:20.366 --> 03:31:26.329]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:31:26.329 --> 03:31:31.432]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:31:31.432 --> 03:31:33.673]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:31:34.033 --> 03:31:35.755]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:31:35.755 --> 03:31:45.763]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:31:45.763 --> 03:31:48.405]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:31:48.405 --> 03:31:53.950]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[03:34:16.036 --> 03:34:22.020]  We saw what happens when people don't want you saying what you want to say.
[03:34:22.020 --> 03:34:30.246]  Alex Jones, myself over at Compound Media, we can't be held hostage by sponsors.
[03:34:30.246 --> 03:34:39.732]  We need our people to support us and our sponsors because once they are taken away, we can't broadcast.
[03:34:39.732 --> 03:34:40.873]  We are silenced.
[03:34:40.873 --> 03:34:44.095]  We saw what happened to Laura Ingram over on Fox News.
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:54.365]  She talks about this David Hogg, one of these kids from the school shooting, and he's got an opinion.
[03:34:54.365 --> 03:35:00.888]  He's out there talking about things, which immediately opens you up to something called rebuttal.
[03:35:00.888 --> 03:35:01.648]  That's right.
[03:35:01.648 --> 03:35:09.933]  Someone might not agree with an 18 year old or 19, however old he is, talking about gun control and things like that.
[03:35:09.933 --> 03:35:12.534]  There's going to be opposing viewpoints.
[03:35:12.534 --> 03:35:14.715]  But the second you make an opposing viewpoint,
[03:35:15.966 --> 03:35:23.649]  You are deemed a child murderer, you have blood on your hands, and you should never ever be heard from again.
[03:35:23.649 --> 03:35:32.612]  So Laura Ingraham, thank God Fox stood by her, because I've seen a lot of people fold under that kind of pressure and fire people.
[03:35:32.612 --> 03:35:36.693]  And now I've gotten into some arguments with people on Twitter about this.
[03:35:36.693 --> 03:35:40.895]  They say, well that's the marketplace, it's a boycott,
[03:35:41.508 --> 03:35:42.509]  We're allowed to do that.
[03:35:42.509 --> 03:35:45.950]  That's expressing our First Amendment rights.
[03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:47.091]  No.
[03:35:47.091 --> 03:35:48.791]  It's not a boycott.
[03:35:48.791 --> 03:35:50.992]  That is mafia tactics.
[03:35:50.992 --> 03:35:54.234]  That is mob intimidation.
[03:35:54.234 --> 03:36:05.019]  Let me explain the difference to some confused people that don't understand what a boycott is and what absolute tyranny in silencing an opposing viewpoint is.
[03:36:06.207 --> 03:36:09.148]  If you want to boycott Laura Ingraham, here's what you do.
[03:36:09.148 --> 03:36:16.071]  You tell all your friends, you can make signs, you do whatever you want, and say, don't watch Laura Ingraham's show.
[03:36:16.071 --> 03:36:27.957]  Once the ratings go down, the sponsors will say, we're not getting our money's worth, because no one's watching the show, and we will cancel our buys on that program.
[03:36:27.957 --> 03:36:28.977]  That is a boycott.
[03:36:28.977 --> 03:36:32.259]  That would be a boycott against Laura Ingraham.
[03:36:32.259 --> 03:36:35.400]  Tyrannical mob tactics to silence opposition
[03:36:36.429 --> 03:36:56.833]  Is calling, writing, going on social media and intimidating the sponsors into cancelling their buys on Laura Ingraham, regardless of how well she's doing and how much of their money's worth they're actually getting from advertising on her show.
[03:36:56.833 --> 03:37:00.654]  The MyPillow guy, you think he goes, uh, well, we're doing great.
[03:37:01.320 --> 03:37:02.902]  Let's look at Laura Ingraham.
[03:37:02.902 --> 03:37:04.703]  Oh yeah, wow, we're selling a lot of pillows.
[03:37:04.703 --> 03:37:06.285]  We're selling a lot of pillows.
[03:37:06.285 --> 03:37:09.527]  My pillow, made in my home state of Minnesota.
[03:37:09.527 --> 03:37:12.350]  Laura, Ingraham's doing very well for us.
[03:37:12.350 --> 03:37:14.552]  But we'll pull the ads.
[03:37:14.552 --> 03:37:15.533]  He didn't, mind you.
[03:37:15.533 --> 03:37:17.354]  He stuck by her.
[03:37:17.354 --> 03:37:25.622]  But they're trying to make people actually pull their ads based on nothing but the fact that she has an opposing viewpoint from them.
[03:37:26.440 --> 03:37:28.341]  That's mob tactics.
[03:37:28.341 --> 03:37:36.766]  That's exactly like a mafia walking into a store and saying, you need to pay us or there's going to be a problem.
[03:37:36.766 --> 03:37:42.949]  It's them saying you need to cancel your buys on this show or there's going to be a problem.
[03:37:44.173 --> 03:37:45.694]  That's not a boycott.
[03:37:45.694 --> 03:37:47.615]  You want to boycott Laura Ingraham?
[03:37:47.615 --> 03:37:49.135]  Don't watch Laura Ingraham.
[03:37:49.135 --> 03:37:50.896]  Tell your friends not to watch her.
[03:37:50.896 --> 03:37:53.837]  That is an American thing to do.
[03:37:53.837 --> 03:37:57.399]  That's exercising your rights.
[03:37:57.399 --> 03:37:59.320]  Intimidation is not.
[03:37:59.320 --> 03:37:59.980]  That's different.
[03:37:59.980 --> 03:38:01.481]  A lot of people don't understand that.
[03:38:01.481 --> 03:38:03.021]  I've been called out plenty of times.
[03:38:03.021 --> 03:38:03.742]  It's a boycott.
[03:38:03.742 --> 03:38:04.562]  You're allowed to do it.
[03:38:04.562 --> 03:38:05.102]  No.
[03:38:05.102 --> 03:38:05.722]  It's not a boycott.
[03:38:07.839 --> 03:38:16.823]  We were talking about Mueller, the Mueller investigation, the Mueller circus sideshow.
[03:38:16.823 --> 03:38:18.664]  Who isn't seeing this?
[03:38:18.664 --> 03:38:21.446]  I don't have any special powers.
[03:38:21.446 --> 03:38:27.508]  Alex Jones, well, Alex might have special powers, I'm not sure, but I don't think he does.
[03:38:27.508 --> 03:38:32.291]  But a lot of people can see what's going on, but a lot of people can't.
[03:38:32.291 --> 03:38:37.033]  I don't understand the hatred for Donald Trump.
[03:38:37.819 --> 03:38:40.139]  Is making people blind.
[03:38:40.139 --> 03:38:44.380]  You have to see that this investigation is a farce.
[03:38:44.380 --> 03:39:00.583]  They are in search of something to pin on Donald Trump so that they can continue with some type of impeachment proceedings and remove a democratically elected president because they don't like him.
[03:39:00.583 --> 03:39:02.043]  They don't like what he stands for.
[03:39:02.043 --> 03:39:05.744]  They don't like the people that voted for him, which, by the way, are called
[03:39:06.701 --> 03:39:12.666]  Americans, that's right, Americans voted for Donald Trump.
[03:39:12.666 --> 03:39:20.192]  You know, for the past, the eight years prior to Donald Trump, we had a president in office that a lot of people didn't like.
[03:39:20.192 --> 03:39:24.335]  There wasn't a concerted effort to remove him from office.
[03:39:24.335 --> 03:39:32.442]  There wasn't a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week hissy fit going on on mainstream media.
[03:39:33.297 --> 03:39:34.718]  To have him removed.
[03:39:34.718 --> 03:39:35.639]  We didn't like it.
[03:39:35.639 --> 03:39:37.881]  We dealt with it as best we could.
[03:39:37.881 --> 03:39:39.942]  We voiced our opinions on it.
[03:39:39.942 --> 03:39:46.207]  And we accepted that he was going to be our president.
[03:39:46.207 --> 03:39:49.429]  The opposition to Donald Trump is not accepting that.
[03:39:49.429 --> 03:40:01.299]  And it seems to be a much bigger operation than just the liberals or Democrats or progressives disagreeing with the president.
[03:40:01.299 --> 03:40:02.900]  This goes a lot deeper.
[03:40:03.934 --> 03:40:10.439]  And I've never been one of these people that have looked much deeper than the surface.
[03:40:10.439 --> 03:40:26.531]  I had this naivete that I actually believed that a lot of what the government was telling me was the truth, that mainstream media, aside from a few things you had to sort out, was basically telling me the truth.
[03:40:26.531 --> 03:40:32.075]  The election of Donald Trump showed me and a lot of other people that that just is not so.
[03:40:33.246 --> 03:40:38.167]  And we are being fed a lot of disinformation.
[03:40:38.167 --> 03:40:39.928]  And there's a reason for it.
[03:40:39.928 --> 03:40:46.150]  There's a much more nefarious, evil reason why these things are going on.
[03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:55.852]  Why we see this Mueller investigation continuing month after month into what amounts to, will be years.
[03:40:55.852 --> 03:40:57.973]  And they have not found a thing.
[03:40:57.973 --> 03:41:01.454]  They invade, they invade the right
[03:41:02.896 --> 03:41:16.147]  To lawyer client privilege and raid the office of Donald Trump's lawyer looking for, looking for, we don't know.
[03:41:16.147 --> 03:41:21.371]  Last I heard they were looking for something that had to do with the Access Hollywood tape.
[03:41:21.371 --> 03:41:23.713]  Remember that one?
[03:41:23.713 --> 03:41:26.255]  They actually were looking for something like that.
[03:41:26.255 --> 03:41:28.597]  What's on the warrant?
[03:41:28.597 --> 03:41:30.258]  I want to know what's on that warrant.
[03:41:30.258 --> 03:41:31.259]  What are they looking for?
[03:41:32.213 --> 03:41:45.340]  What huge thing took them over a year to finally decide, hey, we need to bust open the door of Trump's lawyer and and rifle through privileged information?
[03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:48.242]  Well, I tell you something, you better have something good.
[03:41:48.242 --> 03:41:55.386]  And I can't imagine they do, because we haven't heard anything in over a year of this investigation.
[03:41:55.386 --> 03:41:58.688]  We have not heard one thing that attaches Donald Trump
[03:42:00.023 --> 03:42:05.106]  To some type of Russian collusion, whatever the hell that is.
[03:42:05.106 --> 03:42:12.190]  But we're hearing about porn stars and the fact that Donald Trump was unfaithful.
[03:42:12.190 --> 03:42:16.793]  And like Alex said at the top of this hour, we knew this.
[03:42:16.793 --> 03:42:18.334]  This isn't a surprise.
[03:42:18.334 --> 03:42:27.600]  This didn't keep us from voting for Donald Trump and having him legally elected as the President of the United States of America.
[03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:28.140]  We didn't care.
[03:42:28.140 --> 03:42:29.701]  We just wanted the country to be better.
[03:42:30.726 --> 03:42:38.114]  And he's an outsider, and he's in their game, and they don't like it, and they're trying to have him removed.
[03:42:38.114 --> 03:42:40.256]  Because that's what they do.
[03:42:40.256 --> 03:42:41.738]  He's not business as usual.
[03:42:41.738 --> 03:42:43.500]  He's not one of the boys.
[03:42:43.500 --> 03:42:48.085]  And they're not happy with that, and we have to see where this is going.
[03:42:48.085 --> 03:42:48.946]  It's a dangerous place.
[03:42:48.946 --> 03:42:50.147]  Be back in moments!
[03:42:50.147 --> 03:42:51.309]  Anthony Cumia, InfoWars.com.
[03:42:53.086 --> 03:42:56.848]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:42:56.848 --> 03:43:03.892]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:43:03.892 --> 03:43:08.655]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:43:08.655 --> 03:43:09.395]  It's very simple.
[03:43:09.395 --> 03:43:10.336]  We went out and looked.
[03:43:10.336 --> 03:43:10.996]  What is the top?
[03:43:10.996 --> 03:43:11.897]  What is the best?
[03:43:11.897 --> 03:43:13.138]  We'll just put even more product in.
[03:43:13.138 --> 03:43:13.838]  We'll make it better.
[03:43:13.838 --> 03:43:17.540]  Leading competitors put $2 of product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:43:17.540 --> 03:43:19.681]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:43:19.681 --> 03:43:20.302]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:43:22.503 --> 03:43:25.545]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[03:43:25.545 --> 03:43:29.988]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:43:29.988 --> 03:43:33.831]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:43:33.831 --> 03:43:37.693]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:43:37.693 --> 03:43:40.875]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:43:40.875 --> 03:43:44.498]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[03:43:44.498 --> 03:43:47.099]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[03:43:47.099 --> 03:43:48.120]  It's amazing.

[03:44:56.821 --> 03:44:58.763]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:44:58.763 --> 03:45:09.274]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:45:09.274 --> 03:45:12.618]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[03:45:13.098 --> 03:45:13.358]  Absolutely.
[03:45:35.868 --> 03:45:48.765]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:45:53.666 --> 03:45:56.687]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:45:56.687 --> 03:46:00.888]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:46:00.888 --> 03:46:07.591]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:46:07.591 --> 03:46:11.352]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:46:12.052 --> 03:46:31.571]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:46:32.111 --> 03:46:36.233]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:46:36.233 --> 03:46:47.479]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:46:47.479 --> 03:46:56.563]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:46:56.563 --> 03:46:59.265]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.330 --> 03:47:16.151]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:16.151 --> 03:47:19.412]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.412 --> 03:47:27.075]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:47:27.075 --> 03:47:28.175]  Welcome, welcome back.
[03:47:28.175 --> 03:47:31.936]  Anthony Cumia, InfoForce.com.
[03:47:31.936 --> 03:47:34.557]  Yeah, there's just so much speculation as to what
[03:47:35.407 --> 03:47:39.330]  The hell is going on with this country?
[03:47:39.330 --> 03:47:46.836]  We've heard from Alex this war that globalists are waging on this country.
[03:47:46.836 --> 03:47:51.759]  The way it's being torn apart from the inside out.
[03:47:51.759 --> 03:47:55.642]  We don't look at ourselves as Americans anymore.
[03:47:55.642 --> 03:48:03.068]  We hear all the time diversity is our greatest strength and all you see are people that resent each other.
[03:48:03.658 --> 03:48:05.919]  For their diversity.
[03:48:05.919 --> 03:48:14.783]  We don't have American values anymore that seem to have held us together for so many years.
[03:48:14.783 --> 03:48:31.231]  No matter what we disagreed on for 200 years or so before it really started getting a little frayed around the edges, we at least looked at ourselves that we had a commonality of being Americans.
[03:48:31.231 --> 03:48:31.811]  That's gone.
[03:48:32.463 --> 03:48:33.784]  It's just gone.
[03:48:33.784 --> 03:48:40.587]  There doesn't seem to be that common thread that holds us together as Americans anymore.
[03:48:40.587 --> 03:48:52.394]  There's so many different groups and factions and just because you practice a different religion, that means you can't accept or respect another person's.
[03:48:52.394 --> 03:48:58.657]  And again, without that commonality of just being Americans, the whole thing falls apart.
[03:48:59.776 --> 03:49:05.800]  I was watching an amazing documentary the other night on the Roosevelt's.
[03:49:05.800 --> 03:49:16.287]  Now, regardless of how you feel about their politics and whatnot, it was just the presidency and what led up to it of Teddy Roosevelt.
[03:49:16.287 --> 03:49:23.552]  Very early 1900s, from the 1800s into the 1900s, a very pivotal time in American history.
[03:49:23.552 --> 03:49:25.233]  It's fascinating.
[03:49:25.899 --> 03:49:33.621]  Because this is a guy, you won't find more of a man's man than Teddy Roosevelt.
[03:49:33.621 --> 03:49:46.784]  And the things he believed in, and again I'm not just talking politically, I'm saying the things he believed in, country, family, the rights of a man to be a man.
[03:49:46.784 --> 03:49:54.866]  You know, after his wife and mother died on the same day, he just picked up, put on a cowboy hat, and went out west.
[03:49:55.575 --> 03:50:09.788]  And just spent time alone in the wilderness getting his head back together and assessing himself, his country, his place in this great nation.
[03:50:09.788 --> 03:50:21.979]  And it really struck me that in a little over a hundred years of this country's existence from that time on, just has fallen apart.
[03:50:22.871 --> 03:50:28.575]  No one cares anymore about America and being American.
[03:50:28.575 --> 03:50:30.397]  It's a bad word.
[03:50:30.397 --> 03:50:32.398]  It's a bad word now.
[03:50:32.398 --> 03:50:39.684]  It's some type of either you're racist or you're a white supremacist or an imperialist.
[03:50:39.684 --> 03:50:49.391]  And years ago, when America was an amazing, great place, it was looked at as a thing of pride.
[03:50:50.353 --> 03:50:57.635]  And when you spoke about it, other people got on board and talked also about how wonderful it was.
[03:50:57.635 --> 03:50:59.515]  The opportunity.
[03:50:59.515 --> 03:51:03.836]  And just the amazing place to raise a family.
[03:51:03.836 --> 03:51:10.778]  You look at someone like Teddy Roosevelt now, he wouldn't be able to speak on a college campus.
[03:51:10.778 --> 03:51:17.219]  Because he would be talking about war and glory and shooting animals.
[03:51:19.327 --> 03:51:23.728]  He would be labeled toxic masculinity.
[03:51:23.728 --> 03:51:26.609]  Toxic masculinity.
[03:51:26.609 --> 03:51:28.690]  They've actually come up with something.
[03:51:28.690 --> 03:51:35.031]  A slur against a man being a man.
[03:51:35.031 --> 03:51:38.892]  We're not allowed anymore to find women attractive.
[03:51:38.892 --> 03:51:44.854]  The basic thing that keeps human beings repopulating the earth.
[03:51:45.723 --> 03:51:50.184]  The fact that men will find women attractive.
[03:51:50.184 --> 03:51:51.705]  It's now a bad thing.
[03:51:51.705 --> 03:51:59.327]  An instinct that has been ingrained in human beings for millennia.
[03:51:59.327 --> 03:52:00.848]  And it's a bad thing now.
[03:52:00.848 --> 03:52:07.910]  They label that and they make sure, oh boy, do they make sure they spread it around the schools.
[03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:10.350]  Get them while they're young.
[03:52:10.350 --> 03:52:12.351]  Tell them about gender fluidity.
[03:52:13.121 --> 03:52:21.242]  And toxic masculinity, and feminism, and all the things that rip us apart.
[03:52:21.242 --> 03:52:23.623]  Ah, to anger a conservative, lie to him.
[03:52:23.623 --> 03:52:26.243]  To anger a liberal, tell him the truth.
[03:52:26.243 --> 03:52:28.704]  Theodore Roosevelt.
[03:52:28.704 --> 03:52:41.046]  If you get the opportunity, man, I tell you, watch it, because I honestly believe the best way to try to see where we're going as a nation is to look at where we've been.
[03:52:41.875 --> 03:52:43.337]  And what worked?
[03:52:43.337 --> 03:52:44.678]  What didn't work?
[03:52:44.678 --> 03:52:48.763]  Believe me, I don't see any new geniuses coming up.
[03:52:48.763 --> 03:52:54.109]  We get new technology and whatnot that winds up biting us in the ass anyway.
[03:52:54.109 --> 03:53:03.019]  But we get new technology, there's some new ideas and research, new medicines, but I'm not seeing any new ideas as far as how
[03:53:04.771 --> 03:53:09.695]  Men are supposed to be men and how we're supposed to what what's good for a country?
[03:53:09.695 --> 03:53:10.936]  What's bad for a country?
[03:53:10.936 --> 03:53:30.671]  These are all basic things that have been in place and and still work So you look back in time and you see what worked and what didn't work and all the things that seem to have worked are now horrible things to the progressive left They they do not like families traditional families and
[03:53:31.454 --> 03:53:37.319]  They don't like people having unification in anything.
[03:53:37.319 --> 03:53:42.723]  And especially, like I said, in country.
[03:53:42.723 --> 03:53:45.886]  Trying to take away basic rights.
[03:53:45.886 --> 03:53:47.647]  The top ten.
[03:53:47.647 --> 03:53:52.551]  They're trying to infringe upon every one of them.
[03:53:52.551 --> 03:53:56.174]  And we see people talking about the Second Amendment a lot.
[03:53:56.174 --> 03:54:00.278]  I am just a staunch advocate of our Second Amendment right.
[03:54:02.315 --> 03:54:05.276]  It prevents many evils.
[03:54:05.276 --> 03:54:08.778]  And we see what's happening, and we're being compared to other nations.
[03:54:08.778 --> 03:54:12.500]  We're told what an amazing place America is.
[03:54:12.500 --> 03:54:15.021]  What an amazing, unique country we are.
[03:54:15.021 --> 03:54:19.803]  And in some ways, we cannot be compared to other nations.
[03:54:19.803 --> 03:54:25.345]  And then as far as the gun issue goes, all people want to do is compare us to other nations.
[03:54:25.345 --> 03:54:30.207]  Well, the things that make us very unique in this country, freedoms that we have,
[03:54:30.914 --> 03:54:43.178]  The freedoms that we have to make ourselves great are also the same freedoms that people have to be idiots, to be stupid, to be reckless.
[03:54:43.178 --> 03:54:49.320]  Because those same freedoms that we cherish can be used for evil things.
[03:54:49.320 --> 03:54:53.622]  And that's why you can't compare America to any other place.
[03:54:53.622 --> 03:54:58.083]  The United Kingdom is now having, London, is having this horrible knife problem.
[03:54:58.704 --> 03:55:03.625]  Apparently, without guns, people go around stabbing each other.
[03:55:03.625 --> 03:55:06.206]  So it has nothing to do with the weapon itself.
[03:55:06.206 --> 03:55:14.987]  And I've heard in the past many times, especially when you have a mass shooting, the argument is always, hey, what about if other people were armed?
[03:55:14.987 --> 03:55:16.568]  Good people with guns were armed.
[03:55:16.568 --> 03:55:19.068]  And we get the same scenario from the left.
[03:55:19.068 --> 03:55:20.808]  It'd be the Wild West!
[03:55:20.808 --> 03:55:23.349]  It's gonna be this crazy shootout!
[03:55:24.201 --> 03:55:26.942]  People with guns will just start shooting everybody!
[03:55:26.942 --> 03:55:28.243]  Like, oh really?
[03:55:28.243 --> 03:55:30.404]  We're just innately murderers that want to kill?
[03:55:30.404 --> 03:55:32.285]  Why don't... Yes, it's crazy!
[03:55:32.285 --> 03:55:35.726]  Alright, then the UK now wants people to give up their knives.
[03:55:35.726 --> 03:55:38.307]  They say that only cowards carry knives.
[03:55:38.307 --> 03:55:44.470]  They actually, with the mayor, actually said, Mayor of London, there's no reason to carry a knife.
[03:55:44.470 --> 03:55:46.651]  There's plenty of reasons to carry a knife.
[03:55:46.651 --> 03:55:49.212]  My biggest point is this.
[03:55:49.212 --> 03:55:51.833]  If we are all maniacs that can't be trusted with weapons,
[03:55:52.788 --> 03:55:54.389]  Uh, in a room full of strangers.
[03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:58.972]  Uh, that we would, all of a sudden, it would turn into the Wild West and we'd start killing each other.
[03:55:58.972 --> 03:56:03.995]  The most dangerous place to be in London would be a restaurant.
[03:56:03.995 --> 03:56:11.939]  It's literally a room full of strangers where every man, woman, and child is in possession of a knife.
[03:56:11.939 --> 03:56:16.362]  That, that should be the most dangerous place.
[03:56:16.362 --> 03:56:19.564]  Because people can't be, uh, expected
[03:56:20.279 --> 03:56:23.420]  To not just pick up the knives and start killing each other!
[03:56:23.420 --> 03:56:26.040]  We would do it with guns, that's what we're told!
[03:56:26.040 --> 03:56:31.681]  If you put a bunch of strangers in a room and everyone's armed, it's gonna turn into the Wild West.
[03:56:31.681 --> 03:56:42.003]  But for some reason, we can sit peacefully with strangers and eat when we are all armed with what is apparently the most dangerous item in London, the knife.
[03:56:42.003 --> 03:56:47.764]  And we somehow, somehow keep it together and don't just go stabbing each other.
[03:56:49.838 --> 03:56:55.759]  This might lead a sane person to believe it has nothing to do with the weaponry.
[03:56:55.759 --> 03:56:58.560]  It has nothing to do with the weapons themselves.
[03:56:58.560 --> 03:57:02.480]  There are bad people who will do bad things.
[03:57:02.480 --> 03:57:07.421]  And I don't know what planet you're from if you believe that could be changed.
[03:57:07.421 --> 03:57:12.922]  Because that is another thing that has been ingrained in us and in some people for millennia.
[03:57:12.922 --> 03:57:16.763]  Just like the fact that men will love looking at attractive women.
[03:57:17.382 --> 03:57:22.867]  Even people that want to be President of the United States of America.
[03:57:22.867 --> 03:57:24.008]  I am Anthony Comey.
[03:57:24.008 --> 03:57:30.074]  You can check me out on compoundmedia.com with the wonderful Artie Lang.
[03:57:30.074 --> 03:57:35.299]  And I want to thank everyone at infowars.com, especially Alex Jones.
[03:57:35.299 --> 03:57:35.899]  I love the guy.
[03:57:35.899 --> 03:57:42.205]  You know, big fan for years, and it's a very special treat for me to be on infowars.com.
[03:57:42.205 --> 03:57:43.026]  We'll see you next time.
[03:57:43.266 --> 03:57:49.574]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[03:57:49.574 --> 03:57:57.984]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[03:57:57.984 --> 03:58:02.670]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[03:58:03.030 --> 03:58:06.773]  We only have 150% and then it helps fund our operation.
[03:58:06.773 --> 03:58:09.595]  Well now it's 50% off.
[03:58:09.595 --> 03:58:18.022]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[03:58:18.022 --> 03:58:19.843]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[03:58:19.843 --> 03:58:21.344]  But the two go together.
[03:58:21.344 --> 03:58:23.386]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[03:58:23.386 --> 03:58:32.313]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:58:32.853 --> 03:58:38.040]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[03:58:38.040 --> 03:58:42.386]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[03:58:44.141 --> 03:58:50.607]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products we have in Fuller's life, it'd take hours.
[03:58:50.607 --> 03:58:53.029]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:58:53.029 --> 03:58:54.210]  It's stronger.
[03:58:54.210 --> 03:58:55.832]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:58:55.832 --> 03:58:59.055]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:58:59.055 --> 03:59:00.176]  It's back in stock.
[03:59:00.176 --> 03:59:03.359]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:59:03.359 --> 03:59:06.682]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:59:07.082 --> 03:59:07.242]  I think?
[03:59:25.212 --> 03:59:27.835]  Super high-quality silver and a lot more.
[03:59:27.835 --> 03:59:29.236]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:59:29.236 --> 03:59:39.164]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:59:39.164 --> 03:59:47.591]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:59:47.591 --> 03:59:50.234]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
