[00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:21.680]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:36.689]  Well, strap yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen, because you are living through, I am living through, we are all living through an incredible time to be alive right now.
[00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.769]  Wow!
[00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:45.919]  We've got two federal judges that are over the whole Mueller fiasco.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.204]  The giant Democratic Party temper tantrum that's been going on for a year and a half.
[00:00:51.303 --> 00:00:55.146]  Since President Trump got elected and then got into office.
[00:00:55.186 --> 00:01:10.219]  And now that the economy is turning around and all these big peace deals are happening, the fact that we have good governance that's based on Americana again, they have gone into their death rattle, their death spiral, their death spasm.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.381]  It is insane.
[00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:16.625]  And I got to tell you, so much is happening.
[00:01:17.523 --> 00:01:25.507]  The White House just called out China for being involved in domestic propaganda with Hollywood, and with the universities, and told them, stop it!
[00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:31.990]  I mean, China, you talk about Russia, Russia can't even make its stoplights work across the country.
[00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.810]  They've got major problems.
[00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.892]  Of course, their country is three times bigger than ours as well.
[00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:43.835]  Russia is not involved in jack crap, except for getting our uranium from the Clintons, and stuff like that.
[00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:45.910]  And I'm not defending Russia.
[00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.793]  If they were in our business, I'd be in their grill right now.
[00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:54.359]  But China basically runs this country.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.762]  And Trump's trying to get control back from them.
[00:01:56.942 --> 00:02:00.906]  That's why he's got my full backing, even though I disagree with some of the stuff he does geopolitically.
[00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:03.889]  But more and more, he just always turns out to be right.
[00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:08.179]  I got mad about the Syria thing.
[00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.200]  It's just this new thing.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.742]  White House counters China's Orwellian disinformation aimed at Americans.
[00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:16.383]  Yes!
[00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:17.523]  Yes!
[00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:18.063]  Yes!
[00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:20.464]  And the Democrats are on their payroll.
[00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:23.426]  The Republicans are barely on the Chinese payroll.
[00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:25.027]  And they ought to get locked up.
[00:02:25.487 --> 00:02:26.187]  Some of them are.
[00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:27.328]  I say indict them.
[00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:28.348]  Lock them up.
[00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:32.790]  Let me tell you, if I'm involved with the Russians, lock my ass up right now.
[00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.971]  But of course I'm not.
[00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:36.813]  I'm all about going after tyrants and traitors.
[00:02:37.854 --> 00:02:39.375]  Benedict Arnold, I'm here to tell you.
[00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:41.737]  That's just some of it.
[00:02:42.017 --> 00:02:43.017]  That's just one article.
[00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:46.780]  I mean, I've got like 300 articles here and every one of them is just over-the-top insane.
[00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:51.043]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:55.925]  Federal judge accuses Mueller's team of lying, trying to target Trump.
[00:02:56.526 --> 00:03:02.351]  Another federal judge comes out and says, I call your bluff, no stay on this fake Russiagate investigation lawsuit.
[00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.214]  Mueller's basically calling for a stay on that, trying to pull out of that because none of it's true.
[00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:11.780]  See, they just file these lawsuits and file these criminal indictments and there's nothing there.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.601]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[00:03:15.183 --> 00:03:17.064]  And so, this is the fall of Mueller.
[00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.561]  He's committed so many crimes.
[00:03:19.962 --> 00:03:21.162]  He's acted in a rogue way.
[00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:22.682]  He lied to get his search warrants.
[00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.523]  And you have the federal judge over Manafort saying that.
[00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:27.324]  You've got the other top federal judge saying it.
[00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:30.485]  The other federal judge had to recuse themselves.
[00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:42.688]  The other judge that gave them the warrant to go after the lawyer, Michael Cohen, is a Soros operative and in the WikiLeaks as Hillary's favorite judge and her operative.
[00:03:43.568 --> 00:03:44.308]  I mean, wow.
[00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:45.829]  That's why Trump came out in a tweet.
[00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.574]  And warned 13 angry Democrats on Mueller's team, said, you should be wary.
[00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:54.295]  You better watch your butts.
[00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.078]  Well, they already knew that when he was president-elect.
[00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:00.540]  You already read the emails with Strzok and his girlfriend.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.021]  And he's like, I don't like taking these orders.
[00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:06.124]  I don't like Trump, but this is getting dangerous.
[00:04:07.545 --> 00:04:09.386]  Yeah, because there was nothing there, buddy.
[00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:13.449]  You had all the wiretaps, all the surveillance, everything, nothing there.
[00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.131]  So then you announce, once he gets president,
[00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:24.944]  We never spied on him, and Mueller testified, and Comey testified, and said Trump was crazy.
[00:04:26.425 --> 00:04:27.946]  He said it's crazy.
[00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:35.309]  In his second testimony, once the president was elected, he said it's crazy.
[00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:44.614]  To say anybody spied on the campaign or the president-elect, and now we know it was all spied on, and you have nothing but a bimbo!
[00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:47.416]  That's all you got is a woman paid off!
[00:04:47.756 --> 00:04:49.057]  Whoop-dee-frickin'-do!
[00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:51.159]  We didn't elect him to be a choir boy.
[00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:57.724]  We elected him to turn the country back on and to bring back fertilization of the nation!
[00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:00.367]  Quite frankly, I'd be worried about him if he didn't like women.
[00:05:00.887 --> 00:05:02.208]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:02.669]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:05.151]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:05.531]  Go ahead.
[00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.021]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.063]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:13.005]  It just gets old, man.
[00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:15.046]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:17.829]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.072]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:24.574]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:27.717]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:05:27.737 --> 00:05:29.178]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:05:29.438 --> 00:05:30.319]  Us being shut down?
[00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:31.600]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.060]  You know what, Alex?
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.161]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.001]  Hey, Frank!
[00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:40.662]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:45.243]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:05:45.463 --> 00:05:48.344]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:05:48.604 --> 00:05:48.984]  You understand?
[00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:50.344]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.845]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:57.707]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:05:58.428 --> 00:05:59.148]  Do you understand?
[00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:00.409]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.329]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:11.554]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:14.115 --> 00:06:18.017]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:25.623 --> 00:06:34.171]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:41.577]  Well, I gotta tell you right now that I am... I'm having fits of ecstasy right now.
[00:06:42.178 --> 00:06:43.779]  I'm seeing a lot of really good things happen.
[00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:47.883]  And I'm trying to control myself right now.
[00:06:49.904 --> 00:06:51.586]  Because here's the problem.
[00:06:52.286 --> 00:07:03.836]  The Mueller team has been caught red-handed lying to Congress, lying to the American people, lying to federal judges, and lying to the federal judges and lying to Congress are both felonies.
[00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:17.053]  And the wheels have come off, and Mueller's collapsing, and they're in total crisis mode, and Mueller has signaled he wants to, quote, stop the investigation until after the midterms.
[00:07:17.433 --> 00:07:19.554]  Oh, because he doesn't want to influence the midterms.
[00:07:19.614 --> 00:07:20.454]  Of course not!
[00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:25.575]  The federal judges called him out saying, you're doing this to impeach Trump.
[00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:26.735]  This is a witch hunt.
[00:07:27.256 --> 00:07:28.136]  It's all been confirmed.
[00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:28.976]  Here's the problem.
[00:07:30.056 --> 00:07:37.018]  These crazed maniacs are filled with bravado, hubris, chutzpah,
[00:07:39.864 --> 00:07:47.830]  False aplomb, arrogance, delusions of grandeur, and that's all dangerous.
[00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:58.778]  But now you mix in a very sizable portion of cornered rat syndrome and everything to lose syndrome.
[00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:06.763]  And what would happen in Lost in Space when Robby the Robot knew that bad guys were approaching?
[00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:07.603]  Danger!
[00:08:07.723 --> 00:08:08.144]  Danger!
[00:08:08.264 --> 00:08:09.385]  Danger, Will Robinson!
[00:08:10.045 --> 00:08:10.866]  Enemies approaching!
[00:08:12.007 --> 00:08:12.787]  Enemies approaching!
[00:08:13.748 --> 00:08:14.789]  From the Northeast!
[00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:16.410]  From the Southwest!
[00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.151]  Danger!
[00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:17.591]  Danger!
[00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:18.011]  Danger!
[00:08:19.252 --> 00:08:26.058]  And I'm here to tell you, you don't have to be a rocket scientist or a geopolitical idiot savant to know
[00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:29.618]  They're trying to sabotage the Korean peace deal.
[00:08:29.638 --> 00:08:31.139]  They're trying to start a new war in the Middle East.
[00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:36.122]  They are guaranteed gearing up false flags.
[00:08:36.982 --> 00:08:40.204]  They've got the trucks loaded with the explosives waiting for the green light order.
[00:08:41.385 --> 00:08:42.846]  They're waiting to bomb federal buildings.
[00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:44.107]  They're waiting to shoot up schools.
[00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:45.468]  They are waiting.
[00:08:48.015 --> 00:08:49.596]  They've got their riot forces ready.
[00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:50.817]  They've got their Antifa ready.
[00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:54.660]  It's in all the different Soros documents that came out this year from 2015.
[00:08:54.941 --> 00:08:58.603]  They wanted race war and to start martial law, but it blew up in their face.
[00:08:58.623 --> 00:08:59.184]  It didn't happen.
[00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:00.765]  The whole Strong Cities Initiative.
[00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:02.667]  They had groups out killing cops.
[00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:09.592]  But it all blew up in their face and didn't go the way they wanted it to.
[00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:15.297]  And so they've got all the king's horses and all the king's men, all the globalist forces,
[00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:27.119]  Trying to bully and intimidate the American people back into submission and it's not working but I'm telling you, these losers are going to try to overturn the chessboard.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:41.447]  You ever been playing basketball with somebody or football or chess or whatever game it is and you start winning and so they grab their ball and go home and quit or they overturn the chessboard or they try to fight with you.
[00:09:45.513 --> 00:09:47.855]  And they can't win politically.
[00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:49.696]  They can't win culturally.
[00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:57.262]  And if you look at the universities, and the control freaks, and the anti-free speech garbage, and all the bullying, and they want to extend that out.
[00:09:58.143 --> 00:10:02.566]  And they've all been promised all this power once the globalist leftist paradigm takes over.
[00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:07.089]  They've all been promised, the academics and the rest of it, that they're going to be the new ruling class.
[00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.474]  They're being promised this by the current ruling class that's been exploiting everybody for 50 years.
[00:10:15.794 --> 00:10:18.014]  They're told, oh, we're fighting the man.
[00:10:18.394 --> 00:10:19.995]  The man is telling them that.
[00:10:21.935 --> 00:10:25.316]  And they're being told that once they finally take over, there'll be this utopia.
[00:10:27.956 --> 00:10:36.018]  And during the consolidation phase, they'll all make extra money and get ahead a little bit for five, 10 years, but then the world collapse like Venezuela or every other country where this is done.
[00:10:39.058 --> 00:10:42.479]  And so there's a lot of really good positive things happening, but I'm here to tell you,
[00:10:44.141 --> 00:10:50.004]  The only thing left they've got is false flags, or giant staged events, or giant crises.
[00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:57.427]  We should open the phones up today and ask the question, what do you think they're going to pull now that they're cornered rats?
[00:10:57.447 --> 00:10:58.127]  Because here's the deal.
[00:10:59.128 --> 00:11:12.754]  Even mainstream media is having trouble ignoring Mueller, caught by the head federal judge in Russiagate, trying to get Trump impeached, lying about, for now almost two years, about all these warrants and the things they're doing, to parallel construct
[00:11:14.124 --> 00:11:23.051]  The illegal wiretapping that Obama and Hillary and the whole system was doing under Clapper and Brennan going back for a year and a half of the campaign.
[00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:25.553]  So we're talking about three and a half years here.
[00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:35.381]  Three and a half years of illegal spying, all this criminal activity going on, rogue agency groups still spying on Trump even after he was in the White House.
[00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:37.050]  That's all confirmed now.
[00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.390]  Completely illegal.
[00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:40.132]  Lied to get the warrants.
[00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:43.174]  The judges understand the House of Cards are coming down.
[00:11:43.454 --> 00:11:44.735]  They understand Trump's winning.
[00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:46.596]  They understand the economy's coming back.
[00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:48.617]  They understand the borders are getting secured.
[00:11:48.857 --> 00:11:50.618]  They understand we're getting giant peace deals.
[00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:54.741]  They understand that Trump is winning.
[00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:57.763]  These judges have known the whole time this thing was a fraud.
[00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:00.665]  Now the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:12:01.025 --> 00:12:05.428]  Now the exit is becoming a stampede.
[00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:12.581]  First they were creeping to the doors when he got president-elect 18 months ago.
[00:12:13.662 --> 00:12:16.264]  Then he got in 16 months ago.
[00:12:19.387 --> 00:12:21.869]  And it began to be a quick trot for the exits.
[00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.373]  Now it's piling up, climbing over each other.
[00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:30.958]  Like a riot at a Rolling Stones concert where the Hells Angels are running security.
[00:12:36.104 --> 00:12:37.845]  Mainstream media is flatlining.
[00:12:39.767 --> 00:12:41.088]  The big money's pulling back.
[00:12:42.869 --> 00:12:44.651]  The only guy doubling down is Soros.
[00:12:45.992 --> 00:12:48.334]  All the other big globalist money got cut off or is pulled back.
[00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:50.796]  Soros goes, I'm all in.
[00:12:50.816 --> 00:12:51.716]  80 plus billion.
[00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:52.417]  Everything.
[00:12:53.017 --> 00:12:54.739]  Because he wants to defeat this country.
[00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:56.100]  He wants to defeat the West.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.101]  He wants to be in charge.
[00:12:57.381 --> 00:12:59.443]  He wants to dictate the surrender of the Christians.
[00:13:00.376 --> 00:13:06.678]  He wants full control, and he can see everything he's done, his life's work, and those demon children of his.
[00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:32.579]  Can see everything circling the black hole of the abyss and so they are giving all their power, all their money, everything, saying destroy everyone that fights me, target their families, target their crew members, target the entire Trump family, target Jones, target Matt Drudge, target Sean Hannity, target, target, target, target, destroy them, destroy them, destroy them, but we're still standing.
[00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:43.342]  And despite that, they're targeting Greg Abbott, they're targeting every patriot senator, every patriot house member, they target their families.
[00:13:43.562 --> 00:13:49.487]  Why do you think Trump's longtime doctor suddenly rolled over and said, he wrote it, he told me to, and he raped me!
[00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:56.152]  And you go read the headline, oh he came and took his medical records after I leaked his medical records on him, which is the law.
[00:13:57.553 --> 00:13:59.575]  These people have clearly been bullied into this.
[00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:09.632]  Soros is funding thousands of candidates from sheriffs, to mayors, to city council, to state houses, to governors.
[00:14:09.992 --> 00:14:12.573]  They are putting all their money in.
[00:14:16.513 --> 00:14:20.074]  Bezos has come out of the closet as a big globalist.
[00:14:20.094 --> 00:14:21.334]  He's always been one behind the scenes.
[00:14:21.654 --> 00:14:22.474]  He's flooding money.
[00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:24.575]  But all the other big globalists have given up.
[00:14:24.835 --> 00:14:31.596]  Bloomberg, Bezos, and Soros are hitting America with everything they've got right now.
[00:14:38.171 --> 00:15:00.566]  They're turning on War of the Sexes, Race War, it's in all the WikiLeaks, it's despicable, and it's criminal sedition in my view, not to be part of the electoral process in this country, but to overthrow it, something Soros has done in more than 30 countries, and that's why he thinks he's invincible, because he's done it over and over and over again, and he thought he had America, finally.
[00:15:01.747 --> 00:15:02.167]  But he didn't.
[00:15:05.213 --> 00:15:23.993]  But the reason they've been demonizing me and saying I should be taken off the air and they say I said that Parkland shooting didn't happen is so ahead of other big events that they will stage, they want me taken off the air or they want me show demonized when they send a squad in here to take me out at a red light or wherever.
[00:15:24.997 --> 00:15:27.279]  In a drive-by, or however they plan to do it.
[00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.440]  I can just see how the tea leaves play here.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.061]  Well, he deserves it!
[00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:33.663]  He's that SOB that said this and did all that.
[00:15:33.983 --> 00:15:37.766]  And once that domino falls, you better know, the teams are coming for you.
[00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.927]  The teams are coming for you and your family.
[00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:40.668]  Be ready!
[00:15:40.828 --> 00:15:41.528]  Be on the watch!
[00:15:41.808 --> 00:15:42.709]  And go offense!
[00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:43.890]  Go offense!
[00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.131]  Offense!
[00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:46.331]  That's your trigger!
[00:15:47.232 --> 00:15:48.873]  They take me down, they take Trump down.
[00:15:49.474 --> 00:15:49.834]  Boom!
[00:15:49.894 --> 00:15:50.815]  You know what that means.
[00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:53.076]  You know who they are, you know their names.
[00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:54.097]  You know who did it.
[00:15:55.031 --> 00:16:01.715]  They want a civil war, they're prominent, they're ready, and that old Nazi collaborator isn't gonna know until he meets the American.
[00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:11.662]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:16:11.862 --> 00:16:19.507]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:16:19.747 --> 00:16:22.889]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:28.174]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:30.876]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:16:31.117 --> 00:16:40.105]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:51.919]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[00:17:02.284 --> 00:17:07.549]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.573]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:17:12.434 --> 00:17:18.680]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:17:20.462 --> 00:17:26.788]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:17:27.608 --> 00:17:32.853]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:17:33.473 --> 00:17:45.604]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:17:46.284 --> 00:17:49.326]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:17:49.386 --> 00:17:54.309]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:58.132]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:18:13.962 --> 00:18:17.486]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.

[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:40.762]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.

[00:19:05.794 --> 00:19:07.115]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:08.857]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[00:19:09.117 --> 00:19:11.519]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:12.480]  We've beaten six.
[00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:14.742]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[00:19:15.443 --> 00:19:16.164]  You're my soldier.
[00:19:16.204 --> 00:19:16.924]  We're all in this together.

[00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:09.476]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.866 --> 00:20:29.535]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:35.563 --> 00:20:41.487]  Coming up, my friends, two powerful reports found by Millie Weaver from the border.
[00:20:41.547 --> 00:20:42.707]  They are incredible.
[00:20:42.848 --> 00:20:46.250]  NHD, beyond vice television quality.
[00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.311]  You've seen her live reports.
[00:20:49.071 --> 00:20:51.093]  These are the condensed reports.
[00:20:51.393 --> 00:20:52.574]  Need to get out there to everybody.
[00:20:53.074 --> 00:20:56.696]  Members of Migrant Caravan admit they want to enter America for money.
[00:20:57.837 --> 00:21:04.461]  Migrants admit it's economic not to claim asylum from violence or persecution.
[00:21:05.947 --> 00:21:06.427]  Powerful.
[00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:11.708]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com right now.
[00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:16.770]  Okay, let me get back to what's coming up.
[00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.710]  I've already mentioned it.
[00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.811]  But the left talks about hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:21:22.171 --> 00:21:26.752]  The New York Times says, oh look, the Republicans don't have any security where they play baseball.
[00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:27.933]  The Freedom Caucus.
[00:21:30.493 --> 00:21:31.934]  Hey, you know, they're all Nazis.
[00:21:31.954 --> 00:21:32.834]  They deserve to die.
[00:21:35.145 --> 00:21:50.525]  But politically, if something happens to myself or happens to President Trump or other leaders, you know who's created the atmosphere, who's created the backdrop for all this, and it's George Soros and the globalists, and they're the ones that need to be held accountable through legal and lawful means.
[00:21:54.411 --> 00:21:56.493]  But they know that they've bitten off more than they can chew.
[00:21:56.613 --> 00:21:58.474]  That's why they're all in now.
[00:21:59.255 --> 00:21:59.996]  No reserves.
[00:22:00.036 --> 00:22:05.941]  They have committed their entire forces, all their money, their operatives are crawling out from under every rock.
[00:22:07.762 --> 00:22:21.734]  And now is the time, ladies and gentlemen, to have the maximum effort, but also to pray on your knees every morning, noon, and night to the God of the universe to give us providence, and to confound and blind our enemies, and to give us the deep sight.
[00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:32.203]  And the quiet place of the Most High, that crystal focus that many seek.
[00:22:34.683 --> 00:22:39.124]  Now is the time for God's Spirit to be poured out upon the land against the enemy.
[00:22:39.444 --> 00:22:44.625]  For when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:47.886]  And I pray that all of you pray to be that standard.
[00:22:49.926 --> 00:22:52.667]  But God is God.
[00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:57.134]  And won't come into you unless you ask and really want it.
[00:22:59.215 --> 00:23:01.856]  And that nagging spirit of the world will say, don't do it.
[00:23:02.397 --> 00:23:03.577]  But you've got to really want it.
[00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:08.780]  And the God of the universe, the God of free will, will come into you.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.783]  Now, next segment, I'm going to get directly into the huge developments.
[00:23:13.503 --> 00:23:14.263]  What happened Friday?
[00:23:14.283 --> 00:23:16.545]  Because one judge got a lot of attention, the other got almost none.
[00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:25.185]  Now more shoes have dropped, more dominoes have fallen, more big red balloons have gone up with the Mueller investigation.
[00:23:25.565 --> 00:23:30.447]  Mueller investigation in jeopardy as witch hunt accusations turn out to be true!
[00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:33.908]  What are they going to do?
[00:23:34.108 --> 00:23:35.148]  What are they going to pull?
[00:23:35.168 --> 00:23:38.749]  I want to ask the listeners that question.
[00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:39.730]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:23:40.606 --> 00:23:42.568]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:23:42.608 --> 00:23:44.890]  First-time callers in the first and second hour.
[00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.171]  We'll open the phones up later for everybody.
[00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:47.252]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:23:47.532 --> 00:23:54.058]  And then later in the next hour, we'll open the phones up specifically for
[00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.671]  Crazy fascists that call themselves liberal.
[00:23:59.732 --> 00:24:01.953]  I want to hear from you guys a year and a half into Trump.
[00:24:02.033 --> 00:24:03.693]  Are you still against him?
[00:24:04.334 --> 00:24:05.274]  You want to be able to call in?
[00:24:05.294 --> 00:24:06.035]  I know you're out there.
[00:24:06.075 --> 00:24:11.918]  If you're able to string a few sentences together, able to dial a telephone, we will take your calls coming up.
[00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:14.639]  Hell, if you can get on the line right now, you're welcome as well.
[00:24:14.659 --> 00:24:14.799]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:24:18.243 --> 00:24:38.529]  As Mueller begins to collapse, and they talk about him disappearing till the midterms, so we forget about all the rigging at the FBI and the 13 Democrats that made up the file and paid off their families that worked at Fusion GPS to create the fake dossiers and all of it, and lying to get the search warrants, and then lying and saying they weren't spying on Trump.
[00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:47.032]  As all of that huge boondoggle of corruption to frustrate the votes of America comes out,
[00:24:48.806 --> 00:24:50.406]  What are these cornered rats going to do?
[00:24:50.466 --> 00:24:53.387]  Well, the mainstream media isn't going to realize they're on the wrong side of history.
[00:24:53.407 --> 00:24:55.427]  They're going to quadruple down.
[00:24:57.308 --> 00:25:06.250]  Not realizing that they can even pull off taking me out, or Matt Drudge out, or Donald Trump out, or Sean Hannity out, or Tucker Carlson out.
[00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:12.871]  That even if they could try to pull off killing, or arresting, or whatever the opposition,
[00:25:14.206 --> 00:25:23.409]  That America's awake, the world's awake, globalism's in trouble everywhere, nationalism, sovereignty, populism is popping up like mushrooms after a spring rain.
[00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.310]  So what are you gonna do?
[00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.931]  You don't know what to do.
[00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:30.512]  But they're not gonna give up.
[00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:31.472]  They never do.
[00:25:32.032 --> 00:25:34.173]  That's the thing about psychopaths and control freaks.
[00:25:37.574 --> 00:25:39.315]  Trump tweets, is this phony witch hunt gonna...
[00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:46.323]  Go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the midterm elections, which is what the Democrats always intended.
[00:25:46.623 --> 00:25:48.964]  Republicans better get tough and smart before it's too late.
[00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:50.265]  Bingo!
[00:25:52.226 --> 00:25:53.046]  So that's coming up.
[00:25:53.147 --> 00:25:54.187]  And then the huge news.
[00:25:54.247 --> 00:25:59.030]  White House counters Chinese Orwellian disinformation aimed at America.
[00:26:00.271 --> 00:26:00.471]  Yeah.
[00:26:01.592 --> 00:26:02.372]  They own Hollywood.
[00:26:02.392 --> 00:26:03.853]  The big universities have been taken over.
[00:26:04.253 --> 00:26:05.414]  You talk about who's in our business.
[00:26:06.678 --> 00:26:11.782]  Infowars Alex Jones announces Trump is fighting evil artificial intelligence program bent on killing humans.
[00:26:12.102 --> 00:26:13.523]  That's what Elon Musk and others say.
[00:26:13.564 --> 00:26:24.052]  The globalists have set up these AI systems that are building an anti-human world to displace humans and to make it where we can be totally controlled, but you just
[00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:29.391]  Show a short edit of what I said to make it sound like I'm crazy.
[00:26:29.912 --> 00:26:38.320]  Kind of like I talked about reanimating humans or reanimating human brains or growing human brains inside pig guts or inside cows.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.801]  That's all over the news now.
[00:26:39.921 --> 00:26:46.787]  Warning about procedure that reanimates human brains after a bunch of pigs were brought back to life.
[00:26:47.288 --> 00:26:49.230]  Fears raised over human cloning.
[00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.473]  Controversial embryo experiments that are clones.
[00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.548]  It's all coming up today!
[00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:07.337]  But first, we're announcing a new giant special that we haven't done since Christmas.
[00:27:08.619 --> 00:27:10.180]  And I'm not doing it because it's not selling.
[00:27:11.321 --> 00:27:20.570]  I'm doing it because we can look and see how we get the new customers for our amazing fluoride-free, top-of-the-line organic toothpaste.
[00:27:22.082 --> 00:27:26.771]  When we go 30, 40, 50% off and then you become a repeat customer.
[00:27:27.111 --> 00:27:29.035]  So this is one of our best-selling products.
[00:27:31.431 --> 00:27:37.973]  I mean, for total sales, it's the number one bestseller, but we only make $4, $5, $6 at full price on it.
[00:27:38.353 --> 00:27:43.895]  At 50% off, we make $3 on Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[00:27:44.675 --> 00:27:49.136]  Enforced and emboldened and fortified is the word, with colloidal silver and iodine.
[00:27:49.397 --> 00:27:51.777]  We also have a children's version that isn't as strong.
[00:27:52.077 --> 00:27:55.018]  The adult is very concentrated, and so children don't like it.
[00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:56.559]  But adults do.
[00:27:56.739 --> 00:27:57.679]  It's very strong.
[00:27:58.059 --> 00:28:00.000]  Super Blue Non-Fluoride Toothpaste.
[00:28:01.089 --> 00:28:10.011]  With colloidal silver and iodine and a lot of other great fortifications, it's 50% off by itself.
[00:28:10.551 --> 00:28:25.175]  And you can also get it with the Super Blue Mouthwash with colloidal silver and iodine or the Immune Gargle in a 16 ounce concentrate or
[00:28:26.841 --> 00:28:32.324]  In the three ounce, so you can fly with it, or the little one ounce a lot of folks like to get, so they can refill it.
[00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:35.265]  I personally use it for a lot of things, not just my throat.
[00:28:35.525 --> 00:28:40.447]  You can swallow it, because it's also in the supplement range, and get some good chloral silver and iodine.
[00:28:40.848 --> 00:28:42.388]  Super blue immune gargle.
[00:28:42.408 --> 00:28:43.329]  We also have the mouthwash.
[00:28:43.409 --> 00:28:45.790]  Use that first, brush your teeth, and then you've got the immune gargle.
[00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.251]  All of it 50% off.
[00:28:47.771 --> 00:28:49.612]  Talk about game changers.
[00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:54.976]  All the super blue line of products, all six of them are 50% off.
[00:28:54.996 --> 00:29:00.140]  And when you get the combos all together, free shipping on top of it, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:02.422 --> 00:29:11.790]  I was talking to Sam in Texas, who came into the ATX, just experienced it wearing an InfoWars shirt, and they were very hateful to it.
[00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:18.296]  Man, I was rocked into the Starbucks on South Lamar in my InfoWars t-shirt, and let me tell ya,
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.761]  I was the only Infowarrior in the place.
[00:29:21.461 --> 00:29:25.663]  We make a point to be polite, to tip well, to say please and thank you.
[00:29:25.683 --> 00:29:27.284]  Hold doors for people.
[00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:31.085]  But you guys experience a lot of hatred and I just appreciate you.
[00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:32.906]  I commend you for holding up under that.
[00:29:33.346 --> 00:29:35.507]  It's an honor to do it because these are weak people.
[00:29:35.527 --> 00:29:36.628]  We have to stand strong in their face.
[00:29:36.648 --> 00:29:39.729]  But yeah, living here in Austin is quite interesting now.
[00:29:39.749 --> 00:29:47.793]  I got a really nice Infowars May the Truth Be With You black t-shirt and I wear it a lot of places and I get accommodations too.
[00:29:49.826 --> 00:29:51.307]  People commend me for wearing it.
[00:29:51.347 --> 00:30:02.171]  They kind of have a look in their eye that, man, it takes some good shuns to stand up to the persecution and to tell people what we really believe and where we really stand.
[00:30:02.371 --> 00:30:04.431]  But it's nothing new in Christianity.
[00:30:04.972 --> 00:30:13.815]  So yes, I walked into Starbucks today and every person, every person takes a sidelong look at that shirt.
[00:30:15.155 --> 00:30:16.676]  They chat among themselves.
[00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:17.957]  Hey, that's one of those guys.
[00:30:18.037 --> 00:30:19.397]  That's one of those enemies.
[00:30:19.557 --> 00:30:21.679]  That's one of the ones that we talk about.
[00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:22.739]  They're real.
[00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:24.280]  That's one right there.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.481]  And it's a badge I also wear proudly myself.
[00:30:29.342 --> 00:30:40.708]  And it's so sad all we're trying to do is free market, freedom, everything that we know works, and they're just brainwashed by big corporations that think of them as morons like Jeff Bezos.
[00:30:42.873 --> 00:30:47.238]  It's very frustrating, and I just wish that I could deprogram them, but, you know?
[00:30:47.538 --> 00:30:55.267]  And actually, I enjoy being at the grocery store and having somebody come over and scream and cuss at me only every once in a while, you know, and every 50th person that goes by.
[00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:59.652]  And I know that I'm upsetting them because I'm challenging their whole system.
[00:31:07.048 --> 00:31:10.149]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:31:10.189 --> 00:31:10.709]  You're on the air.
[00:31:10.729 --> 00:31:11.889]  Thanks for holding.
[00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:12.749]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:31:12.949 --> 00:31:13.570]  Hey, brother.
[00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:14.230]  Good, man.
[00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.070]  Thank you for calling.
[00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:15.690]  Hey, hey.
[00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:20.211]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:31:20.431 --> 00:31:26.793]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:31:26.933 --> 00:31:28.613]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[00:31:28.713 --> 00:31:34.435]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:31:36.015 --> 00:31:37.136]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:31:37.196 --> 00:31:39.657]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[00:31:39.698 --> 00:31:41.219]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:43.260]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.401]  And exactly.
[00:31:44.421 --> 00:31:48.704]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:31:49.004 --> 00:31:49.284]  Boom!
[00:31:49.424 --> 00:31:52.246]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:52.847]  It's amazing.
[00:31:52.887 --> 00:31:54.187]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[00:31:54.268 --> 00:31:57.129]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:04.520]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:33:14.724 --> 00:33:15.745]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:15.865 --> 00:33:17.627]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:46.336]  We've got so much to cover, I'm going to go to your phone calls in the next segment about what do you think the globalists are going to do now that Mueller's collapsing, he's been caught lying, multiple federal judges over the case have said you just want to impeach Trump, you're a fraud.
[00:33:47.591 --> 00:33:54.053]  He now just wants to pull the case back until after the midterms and hope we forget, but only more criminality is coming out every day.
[00:33:54.533 --> 00:34:06.337]  The 13 Democrats inside the Justice Department and FBI fixing the information, lying to get the warrants, lying to Congress, saying that the president wasn't being surveilled when he was a candidate or president-elect or president.
[00:34:06.737 --> 00:34:10.138]  The stay-behind networks inside government from the Clinton Crime Network.
[00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:13.219]  How they were involved in Russiagate themselves.
[00:34:13.499 --> 00:34:15.220]  How they're on the Communist Chinese payroll.
[00:34:16.397 --> 00:34:18.358]  Every passing day, the economy comes back.
[00:34:18.499 --> 00:34:19.599]  What are they going to do?
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:40.834]  They're going to challenge us with censored internet and force-feeding things like Childish Gambito, giving it 10 million views over the weekend, saying, this is America, this is America, this is America, out of 330 million Americans, showing images of a few hundred people getting killed to create the illusion
[00:34:43.012 --> 00:34:44.213]  We're living in all this carnage.
[00:34:44.393 --> 00:34:48.196]  Only in Democrat blue abscesses.
[00:34:49.797 --> 00:34:54.741]  Only in Democrat cesspits where they've taken all the guns and shipped in the narcotics.
[00:34:59.044 --> 00:35:08.251]  But if you actually go to places like Venezuela, over a thousand people a day are starving to death.
[00:35:10.473 --> 00:35:11.554]  Starving to death.
[00:35:13.234 --> 00:35:18.558]  But the government's passed a law saying you can't report on it and call it starvation.
[00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:22.100]  So it's all this emotional idiocy.
[00:35:26.884 --> 00:35:32.088]  And people fittingly doing a voodoo dance.
[00:35:32.548 --> 00:35:34.650]  You know, I'm looking at video they just played of the
[00:35:36.172 --> 00:35:41.436]  Donald Glover, Childish Gambino dance he's doing that he probably thinks you'd think is real original.
[00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:43.037]  That's a voodoo dance he's doing.
[00:35:43.737 --> 00:35:45.238]  In fact, that's a whole other subject.
[00:35:45.278 --> 00:35:50.582]  Pull me, voodoo dancing, people in trance, and that is a voodoo dance.
[00:35:51.742 --> 00:35:50.582]  110%.
[00:35:51.783 --> 00:36:00.548]  I mean, you've got all of that then personified through artwork, but they don't think you know what you're actually looking at.
[00:36:00.849 --> 00:36:03.090]  You know, the Clintons like to go and do their own voodoo rituals.
[00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:03.771]  That's in the news.
[00:36:04.952 --> 00:36:08.593]  And the media always sits there and then demonizes.
[00:36:10.014 --> 00:36:11.854]  That's where they go into a trance state.
[00:36:11.894 --> 00:36:15.095]  It's once they go into the trance state of particular spirits.
[00:36:15.115 --> 00:36:16.736]  That's a particular dance I recognize.
[00:36:17.636 --> 00:36:19.637]  And they mix it in with some more contemporary stuff.
[00:36:20.597 --> 00:36:22.818]  Some shuffles and some, you name it.
[00:36:23.698 --> 00:36:26.819]  Getting back to what I was saying here, we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:36:31.721 --> 00:36:37.244]  But first, let me just blitz through some news before I go to your calls and get back into the wheels coming off on Mueller.
[00:36:38.324 --> 00:36:40.645]  Some very important news I want to hit here.
[00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:49.809]  Looking at the Islamification of the world and the real crimes that are being committed that they don't want you to know about.
[00:36:50.229 --> 00:36:55.732]  And so they're actually passing laws in areas of Europe in a beta test for the US and England for this.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:05.824]  Sex between a 23-year-old migrant, that's an invader, and a 10-year-old girl is not rape, says court in Finland.
[00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:10.327]  And that's from mainstream Finnish news.
[00:37:10.527 --> 00:37:26.936]  The district court or the appeals court in Turku had charged them with aggravated assault, but it was overturned by the higher court saying migrants are allowed to have sex with your children.
[00:37:28.314 --> 00:37:35.298]  Here's another one from Infowars.com, Paul Joseph Watson, with links to the mainstream news in England.
[00:37:35.958 --> 00:37:40.881]  Sweden, 88% of gang rapists have a migrant background.
[00:37:42.882 --> 00:37:44.783]  Perpetrators have a distorted view of sexuality.
[00:37:45.064 --> 00:37:50.407]  But see, if it's cultural to rape little girls and little boys, or to poop in the pool, it's okay.
[00:37:51.567 --> 00:37:54.469]  Police won't give description of rapists in Sweden.
[00:37:54.849 --> 00:37:57.831]  Voice of Europe, that's because they've passed laws where you can't do it.
[00:37:59.326 --> 00:38:02.488]  East London hit by acid attack spree, London Express.
[00:38:03.289 --> 00:38:05.670]  Three rushed to hospital in mourning horror.
[00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.072]  They were called to Kingsland High Street in Dalston after 5 a.m.
[00:38:09.092 --> 00:38:11.994]  this morning after the men sustained injuries.
[00:38:12.094 --> 00:38:14.255]  That is a Islamic specialty.
[00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:19.038]  They have record number acid attacks, up to seven per weekend now.
[00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:23.241]  Swedish child raped by three men on their way home.
[00:38:24.081 --> 00:38:26.563]  Police refuse to give description of the perpetrators.
[00:38:28.015 --> 00:38:29.356]  That's out of SVT.
[00:38:30.577 --> 00:38:36.081]  Paris mayor backs Communist Party plan to turn public park into migrant camp.
[00:38:36.402 --> 00:38:43.287]  Proposal was previously rejected due to the distance of the site to the nearest public transportation or bathrooms.
[00:38:44.148 --> 00:38:46.890]  And that's out of Le Figaro, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.511]  It's a Breitbart article, but Le Figaro.
[00:38:48.792 --> 00:38:51.454]  And of course you can see just the defecation, everything.
[00:38:52.657 --> 00:38:53.317]  Total hell.
[00:38:53.538 --> 00:38:57.820]  Tourism is down 80% in France in general the last decade, but that's okay.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.761]  You've got to do it.
[00:39:00.602 --> 00:39:01.503]  Gun-free Britain.
[00:39:01.603 --> 00:39:05.125]  Four shootings in 48 hours in Sadiq Khan's London.
[00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:09.068]  Now a higher crime rate than New York City.
[00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:13.531]  Saudi Arabia will build Christian churches.
[00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:19.375]  After striking a deal with the Vatican to open its borders to millions of Muslims, they'll build a couple churches.
[00:39:21.769 --> 00:39:22.569]  Talk about surrender.
[00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:29.852]  Over 20K migrants entered Europe in the last four months, even though Europe claims, due to massive revolt, that they've stopped the influx that they invited.
[00:39:31.873 --> 00:39:32.573]  That's The Daily Caller.
[00:39:34.334 --> 00:39:36.995]  So that's a stack of news on that front and other international news.
[00:39:38.095 --> 00:39:41.216]  Russia's Putin sworn in for another six years in office.
[00:39:42.937 --> 00:39:46.778]  As Iran says it could remain a nuclear deal if its interests are guaranteed.
[00:39:46.798 --> 00:39:48.619]  Starting to back off now from Trump.
[00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:54.112]  North Korea's Kim Jong-un could meet Trump in Singapore in June.
[00:39:54.412 --> 00:39:57.534]  Trump says the date and time has been set, but hasn't announced that yet.
[00:39:58.575 --> 00:40:00.136]  Now let's look at the really interesting news.
[00:40:00.696 --> 00:40:07.501]  Reuters' weekly poll reflects upswing in support for President Trump, despite the fact that they, again, sample more Democrats.
[00:40:09.434 --> 00:40:10.355]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[00:40:10.415 --> 00:40:11.716]  So they say he's really at 49%.
[00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:35.213]  That means he's really at about 60-65.
[00:40:35.393 --> 00:40:37.054]  That's why they're so scared, folks.
[00:40:37.074 --> 00:40:39.774]  They know it's a total political realignment and massive awakening.
[00:40:40.194 --> 00:40:44.875]  Polls show Americans are growing increasingly disinterested in Mueller's Russia probe.
[00:40:44.915 --> 00:40:46.036]  They're bored with it.
[00:40:46.956 --> 00:40:48.736]  But the polls don't even ask, do you believe it?
[00:40:49.196 --> 00:40:50.376]  They just ask, are you bored with it?
[00:40:51.237 --> 00:40:56.118]  Donald Trump plagued by scandals despite economic victories, Washington Times reports.
[00:40:56.698 --> 00:40:57.898]  Despite record growth.
[00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:00.659]  Unemployment at 3.9%.
[00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:04.691]  New job startups at record level.
[00:41:04.731 --> 00:41:06.773]  New small business startups at record level.
[00:41:07.434 --> 00:41:07.935]  On and on and on.
[00:41:07.955 --> 00:41:10.738]  Despite all that, all we hear about is the scandals.
[00:41:11.979 --> 00:41:14.162]  Meanwhile, there's video of this up on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:14.182 --> 00:41:15.623]  It's a Steve Watson article.
[00:41:15.984 --> 00:41:23.332]  CNN's Tapper says McCain is American hero for not wanting Trump at the funeral.
[00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:26.089]  Well, why should Trump go to any of these funerals?
[00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:27.530]  They don't want him at Barbara Bush's funeral.
[00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.310]  They don't want him here.
[00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.890]  They don't want him at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.
[00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:31.971]  Then they'd bitch where he doesn't go.
[00:41:32.551 --> 00:41:34.431]  John McCain is part of the Teeting Five.
[00:41:34.891 --> 00:41:36.672]  John McCain helped found ISIS.
[00:41:36.712 --> 00:41:37.952]  He helped launch the Arab Spring.
[00:41:38.412 --> 00:41:41.353]  John McCain is an anti-gun, open borders, crazy person.
[00:41:42.013 --> 00:41:47.994]  And I don't wish ill of the dead, but he, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, has got two feet in the grave.
[00:41:50.259 --> 00:41:55.382]  And so he's preparing to make the jump into hyperspace, and I hope he finds Christ before he goes.
[00:41:55.422 --> 00:42:00.325]  But John McCain and his father have been evil anti-American globalists for a hundred years.
[00:42:00.365 --> 00:42:05.388]  His father goes way back and all sorts of horrible anti-American behavior back to World War II.
[00:42:06.389 --> 00:42:08.630]  And they are true enemies of this country.
[00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:17.135]  So I hope you repent before you make your descent into death.
[00:42:21.454 --> 00:42:22.776]  So that's just some of the news there.
[00:42:22.796 --> 00:42:30.044]  Now, when we come back we're going to your phone calls and more on Mueller.
[00:42:31.963 --> 00:42:34.504]  Warning about procedure that reanimates human brains.
[00:42:34.644 --> 00:42:35.305]  Mainstream News.
[00:42:35.785 --> 00:42:36.846]  Told you about that 20 years ago.
[00:42:37.386 --> 00:42:38.086]  Yeah, it's that old.
[00:42:38.746 --> 00:42:40.627]  The Russians were releasing this stuff 40 years ago.
[00:42:40.647 --> 00:42:45.390]  I mean, hell... There's the Russians 40 years ago.
[00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.651]  Didn't even tell the crew to do that.
[00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:47.471]  They just had that ready.
[00:42:47.511 --> 00:42:47.731]  Wow.
[00:42:48.191 --> 00:42:49.812]  Fears raised over human cloning.
[00:42:50.252 --> 00:42:52.433]  Mainstream News reports that they have human clones.
[00:42:52.914 --> 00:42:53.454]  Of course they do.
[00:42:53.474 --> 00:42:54.615]  They reported that 40 years ago.
[00:42:55.595 --> 00:42:56.436]  So that's just some of it.
[00:42:56.456 --> 00:42:58.479]  Oh, Netflix is killing couples' sex lives.
[00:42:58.499 --> 00:42:58.699]  Yeah.
[00:42:58.959 --> 00:43:00.221]  TV, iPhones, all of it.
[00:43:00.481 --> 00:43:02.603]  Divert you into false reality so you don't live in the real world.
[00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:05.467]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.

[00:43:52.452 --> 00:43:53.834]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:43:54.474 --> 00:43:57.037]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:43:57.778 --> 00:43:59.740]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[00:44:00.321 --> 00:44:02.564]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:08.953]  We've gotten over 100 new TV affiliates in just the last six months.
[00:44:09.073 --> 00:44:10.194]  We're on more satellites.
[00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:12.655]  We're reaching so many new people.
[00:44:12.695 --> 00:44:16.137]  They are blocking us more and more on the web, but thank God you're getting the information out.
[00:44:16.538 --> 00:44:21.101]  We're having congressional hearings about conservatives, populists, nationalists, Christians being...
[00:44:22.245 --> 00:44:22.685]  Censored?
[00:44:23.366 --> 00:44:25.727]  Christian churches being persecuted by the IRS?
[00:44:26.088 --> 00:44:27.729]  I mean, this is real tyranny we're facing.
[00:44:27.809 --> 00:44:33.953]  You, the audience, are the engine, the brains, the guts, the blood, the sweat, the tears, the soul of this operation.
[00:44:34.013 --> 00:44:45.321]  And if you go to Infowarstore.com and look at the water filtration, the air filtration, the non-GMO heirloom seeds, the books, the videos, the Patriot apparel, all of it, hundreds of t-shirts, dozens of ball caps,
[00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:54.127]  When you buy those products, you support the information war, but plus, you're wearing an InfoWars shirt, you wear it in a deep blue state area, you might get hit in the head with a fire iron or something, but you wear it everywhere else.
[00:44:54.147 --> 00:44:56.769]  You get your lunch bought for you, you might beat your wife, your husband, whatever.
[00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:59.751]  This is how we just do these little things that move mountains.
[00:44:59.771 --> 00:45:03.713]  Well, you do it by wearing t-shirts, by wearing ball caps, you do it by having a bumper sticker.
[00:45:03.793 --> 00:45:06.795]  All the orders that come in to InfoWars have five bumper stickers.
[00:45:06.875 --> 00:45:09.137]  I'm doubling it to ten in every order.
[00:45:09.237 --> 00:45:13.300]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, text your right to the supplement page or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:19.845]  Supermale Vitality is just well-known, concentrated, organic herbs that are cold-pressed.
[00:45:19.865 --> 00:45:20.405]  That's the key.
[00:45:20.445 --> 00:45:22.607]  For stamina, libido, energy, you name it.
[00:45:22.647 --> 00:45:23.168]  People love it.
[00:45:23.188 --> 00:45:25.049]  You also, that's 50% off right now.

[00:45:26.711 --> 00:45:27.211]  Read about it.
[00:45:27.231 --> 00:45:28.092]  I don't have time to get to it.
[00:45:28.112 --> 00:45:28.712]  It's amazing.
[00:45:28.752 --> 00:45:31.735]  That goes with the Supermale and Superfemale Vitality like a horse and carriage.
[00:45:31.855 --> 00:45:32.996]  It is 50% off.
[00:45:33.036 --> 00:45:37.680]  Get the two together and get free shipping on the Real Red Pill and Supermale Vitality.
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.301]  They both have thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:45:39.341 --> 00:45:40.282]  The combo doesn't have any
[00:45:40.302 --> 00:45:40.722]  We're good to go.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.921]  Yeah, scam.
[00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:11.641]  Uh, no.
[00:46:11.741 --> 00:46:13.182]  The water table's full of poison.
[00:46:13.322 --> 00:46:14.122]  Everybody knows that.
[00:46:14.222 --> 00:46:14.763]  It's admitted.
[00:46:14.803 --> 00:46:16.644]  You need to filter your water, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:16.664 --> 00:46:17.945]  We have the best gravity-filled systems.
[00:46:18.185 --> 00:46:19.986]  So, yes, I do report on how the water's bad.
[00:46:20.086 --> 00:46:23.388]  And then I sell a water filter I use when I'm on the road or in my own home.
[00:46:23.588 --> 00:46:24.608]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:24.668 --> 00:46:32.653]  Like, if I was gonna open a franchise of a restaurant, if I was a franchisee, I would find a restaurant that I love, that was successful, and had really good food that I would want to franchise.
[00:46:32.853 --> 00:46:34.694]  I'd say, can I franchise your great restaurant?
[00:46:34.714 --> 00:46:38.595]  A lot of people have gone in famously to good restaurants, and they've said, I want to franchise this.
[00:46:38.995 --> 00:46:39.615]  Exactly!
[00:46:39.856 --> 00:46:42.897]  I sell what I use, and I like, and I believe in.
[00:46:43.357 --> 00:46:45.478]  But it shows Hogg, and the media thinks it's like a scam.
[00:46:45.998 --> 00:46:50.339]  He had a water filter ad after he talked about atrazine in the water causing sterility.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:51.740]  Dun-dun-dun.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.940]  Like, oh my god, it's hidden!
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.381]  They always go, Jones said this on air.
[00:46:54.421 --> 00:46:55.001]  We caught it.
[00:46:55.081 --> 00:46:55.481]  Here it is.
[00:46:55.761 --> 00:46:56.962]  It was a big secret.
[00:46:57.322 --> 00:46:58.242]  Millions were watching it.
[00:46:58.722 --> 00:47:00.223]  So, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:06.235 --> 00:47:08.877]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.861 --> 00:47:27.649]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:27.909 --> 00:47:33.713]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:36.408 --> 00:47:54.038]  Well, this is the most hated, most demonized, most attacked radio, television, multimedia transmission in the world by globalists, by criminals, by kingpins, by robber barons, scumbags like good old George Soros.
[00:47:55.059 --> 00:47:57.140]  We're under attack, but we have faith in the people.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.283]  We have faith in you, and I believe we're going to become stronger in the face of this.
[00:48:01.383 --> 00:48:04.545]  But I know this, to quote Churchill, I'm going to go on to the end.
[00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:15.456]  Whatever the cost may be, I'm going to defend humanity, I'm going to defend my family, and I'm going to fight at every level, every way I can, and I will never surrender.
[00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:17.178]  And I know you're not going to surrender as well.
[00:48:18.139 --> 00:48:23.543]  And on that front, just briefly, this week's big special, we just ended Super Metal Vitality 50% off.
[00:48:24.483 --> 00:48:27.826]  I'm getting good about ending these specials when I say we're very close to selling out of it.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.062]  X2 is at regular price like we told you.
[00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:34.584]  That sale is over because we're very close to selling out.
[00:48:35.205 --> 00:48:36.906]  We've got maybe a run and a half left.
[00:48:36.926 --> 00:48:39.789]  We're trying to get that next half run done.
[00:48:40.629 --> 00:48:44.292]  Rush to us before the other sells out.
[00:48:45.633 --> 00:48:52.479]  But we have all of the Super Blue products at 50% off.
[00:48:52.519 --> 00:48:58.124]  And why am I doing that despite the fact that it's close to selling out in the next two weeks and we're not getting more to the middle of June?
[00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:10.510]  Because we can look at our internal numbers and tell, most of you buy it, when is it 30, 40, 50% off, and then you re-buy it at the regular price, which helps fund our operations.
[00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.931]  Because look, it costs us over $3 to make each tube.
[00:49:13.671 --> 00:49:15.372]  We sell it for $12, we're making $9.
[00:49:15.412 --> 00:49:16.812]  But you've got to sell a lot to do that.
[00:49:17.092 --> 00:49:18.373]  It's a big tube, it's concentrated.
[00:49:18.713 --> 00:49:21.414]  When we're 50% off, selling it for $7.
[00:49:24.355 --> 00:49:26.656]  I mean, you know, we're making like $3.5 on it.
[00:49:30.089 --> 00:49:31.030]  Super high quality.
[00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:31.971]  It doesn't have fillers.
[00:49:32.191 --> 00:49:32.871]  It's concentrated.
[00:49:32.891 --> 00:49:35.954]  That's why we have the children's because children can't use the adult.
[00:49:35.974 --> 00:49:37.755]  It's so strong with coiled silver, iodine.
[00:49:39.097 --> 00:49:41.018]  It's unlike any toothpaste anybody's ever used.
[00:49:41.118 --> 00:49:43.500]  Almost everybody that uses it says it's their new favorite.
[00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.682]  Go read the five-star reviews.
[00:49:46.082 --> 00:49:56.011]  There are no reviews on the big combo pack, which is the super blue mouthwash and the 16-ounce, the 3-ounce, and the 1-ounce bottles that you can get
[00:49:57.873 --> 00:49:58.774]  of Immune Gargle.
[00:49:59.154 --> 00:50:02.496]  So you brush your teeth, then you use the mouthwash, wash your mouth out.
[00:50:02.757 --> 00:50:04.278]  The Immune Gargle you can swallow.
[00:50:04.338 --> 00:50:04.938]  It's a supplement.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:10.242]  Learn about it, or spit it out.
[00:50:10.262 --> 00:50:17.167]  3,334 reviews at Power Reviews, one of the top third-party verification groups.
[00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:18.228]  4.8 stars.
[00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:21.430]  Go look at the ratings, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:22.651 --> 00:50:23.472]  4.8 stars out of almost 4,000.
[00:50:23.512 --> 00:50:23.792]  Unprecedented.
[00:50:27.915 --> 00:50:32.476]  Major investigative journals basically harassed Power Reviews, and Power Reviews even opened their books up to them.
[00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:34.437]  I know for a fact.
[00:50:34.477 --> 00:50:38.278]  And then BuzzFeed and others had to back off because they just couldn't believe it.
[00:50:38.898 --> 00:50:39.799]  No one has that.
[00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:41.539]  So thank you all for the reviews.
[00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:43.360]  Thank you for liking the products.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:44.860]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.681]  But this is your chance to try them.
[00:50:48.001 --> 00:50:50.922]  You can buy them individually, 50% off, or everything at once.
[00:50:52.008 --> 00:50:58.093]  And I want you to try Super Blue at 50% off all Super Blue products at infowarestore.com.
[00:50:58.553 --> 00:51:01.615]  DNA Force, back in after six months of being sold out, 50% off.

[00:51:17.287 --> 00:51:17.988]  Okay, let's stop there.
[00:51:20.114 --> 00:51:21.818]  I'm going to take calls into the next hour.
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.643]  Trump is surging in all the polls.
[00:51:25.465 --> 00:51:26.527]  The economy's coming back.
[00:51:26.687 --> 00:51:28.030]  The globals don't know what to do.
[00:51:28.692 --> 00:51:29.714]  Mueller investigation.
[00:51:29.754 --> 00:51:30.896]  Here's just some of the headlines.
[00:51:32.145 --> 00:51:37.387]  Federal judge accuses Mueller team of lying to get warrants to target Trump.
[00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:38.267]  Come on, man.
[00:51:38.567 --> 00:51:39.667]  You just want to impeach him.
[00:51:40.008 --> 00:51:40.608]  You lied.
[00:51:41.368 --> 00:51:42.408]  There's no evidence here.
[00:51:42.828 --> 00:51:45.029]  I want you to declassify these memos.
[00:51:45.369 --> 00:51:46.410]  I've read the whole memos.
[00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.010]  There's nothing secret there.
[00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.431]  You're covering up that there's no evidence.
[00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:50.771]  These are quotes from the judge.
[00:51:52.332 --> 00:51:52.692]  T.S.
[00:51:52.812 --> 00:51:53.452]  Ellis III.
[00:51:54.932 --> 00:51:56.373]  Another federal judge in the probe.
[00:51:57.571 --> 00:52:06.974]  Calls their bluff, does not grant a stay on Discovery, making Mueller give up what evidence he has of Russian bots and Russian companies.
[00:52:07.034 --> 00:52:08.695]  It's all pure malarkey.
[00:52:09.695 --> 00:52:17.858]  We now know the main Russian bot company is a mercenary group, because you can't do this domestically, so you go pay, and 80% was Hillary.
[00:52:18.998 --> 00:52:20.139]  They were just a mercenary group.
[00:52:20.159 --> 00:52:23.280]  You can go pay and get your ads run, and then they'll run them everywhere using bots.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.540]  That's the way it works.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.901]  Most of them are in Canada.
[00:52:27.904 --> 00:52:33.586]  Or New Zealand or Australia of your English-speaking elections because they know how to interface, you know, with English speakers for elections.
[00:52:34.947 --> 00:52:38.348]  But you can go hire Russian companies to spam whatever you want.
[00:52:39.029 --> 00:52:40.990]  Lawnmowers, you know, supplements.
[00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.571]  Amazon hires hundreds and hundreds of companies.
[00:52:44.811 --> 00:52:50.294]  But they sell this idea that Russians influence the election because they can see Russian IP addresses coming back in the U.S.
[00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:51.814]  Of course the Russians are involved.
[00:52:52.514 --> 00:52:53.415]  And they're not effective.
[00:52:54.898 --> 00:52:57.859]  Mueller probe might have to go dark for midterm elections.
[00:52:57.879 --> 00:52:58.540]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.220]  It's all blown up in their face.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.042]  Now they want to pull the turtle's head in and forget about all the scandals.
[00:53:05.643 --> 00:53:07.623]  Hayden says don't work for the Trump administration.
[00:53:07.864 --> 00:53:09.464]  If you're in government, sabotage them.
[00:53:09.504 --> 00:53:10.285]  Don't go along with them.
[00:53:10.425 --> 00:53:12.906]  Well, we've known that's going on for the last year and a half, but there it is.
[00:53:14.907 --> 00:53:15.967]  What'd the judge call it?
[00:53:16.507 --> 00:53:18.108]  He called Mueller unfettered.
[00:53:19.469 --> 00:53:20.289]  That means rogue.
[00:53:21.474 --> 00:53:25.455]  Uninhibited, rampant, unbridled, unrestricted, unrestrained.
[00:53:26.956 --> 00:53:27.876]  That's the definitions.
[00:53:29.576 --> 00:53:32.517]  Meanwhile, I don't think Giuliani overall is doing a very good job.
[00:53:33.097 --> 00:53:34.318]  He's adding more confusion to it.
[00:53:34.338 --> 00:53:35.278]  I agree with Alan Dershowitz.
[00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:37.819]  That's who Trump needs to hire is Alan Dershowitz.
[00:53:39.519 --> 00:53:44.021]  Mueller investigation into Jeopardy as witch hunt accusations play out in court.
[00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:48.062]  Zero Hedge has an excellent article showing how
[00:53:50.003 --> 00:53:54.898]  Now three, and of course, this ought to be my headline, because I saw this over the weekend and I forgot.
[00:53:54.939 --> 00:53:57.186]  I keep saying two judges, excuse me, zero judges, correct?
[00:53:59.637 --> 00:54:14.304]  As of Friday, three separate judges have rendered harsh setbacks to the Mueller investigation, demanding, if you believe it, facts and evidence to back up the special counsel's claims in unredacted format, as one judge demands, or risk having the cases tossed out altogether.
[00:54:14.944 --> 00:54:28.531]  The first major setback happened when a federal judge assigned the criminal case against Trump's former National Security Judge M. Sullivan Mueller's team to turn over any exculpatory evidence to Flynn's defense, because there is none.
[00:54:29.477 --> 00:54:31.238]  Oddly, Flynn's legal team never made the request.
[00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:32.059]  Uh-huh.
[00:54:33.419 --> 00:54:34.640]  I was told by people inside.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.561]  I'm not going to say it on air.
[00:54:39.903 --> 00:54:40.504]  Maybe I should.
[00:54:42.085 --> 00:54:56.534]  I've... You know, I don't break confidences, but I just... I'm going to stop right there.
[00:55:03.413 --> 00:55:06.574]  Yeah, they ask, why isn't Flynn defending himself?
[00:55:06.614 --> 00:55:07.554]  Why did Flynn plead guilty?
[00:55:07.574 --> 00:55:08.394]  Because they'll bankrupt you.
[00:55:09.395 --> 00:55:10.175]  He's just at their mercy.
[00:55:10.215 --> 00:55:10.915]  He's not rich.
[00:55:12.616 --> 00:55:18.077]  And then it goes through the other two, saying they're liars, catching them lying, catching them lying on the warrants, a Manafort case.
[00:55:19.397 --> 00:55:20.378]  It just goes on and on.
[00:55:20.718 --> 00:55:22.318]  But this is the best article I've seen.
[00:55:22.638 --> 00:55:25.519]  I want to make sure, crew, this is posted in FullInfoWars.com.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.401]  This Zero Hedge headline is powerful, but I want to change it to
[00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:39.792]  I want to change it to three federal judges have now exposed Mueller witch hunt.
[00:55:39.812 --> 00:55:41.572]  I mean, that's really what the headline should be.
[00:55:42.953 --> 00:55:44.594]  So we'll post that baby in full.
[00:55:46.555 --> 00:55:47.715]  And again, here's that headline I mentioned.
[00:55:47.735 --> 00:55:50.516]  Dershowitz, Trump team playing into Mueller's hands.
[00:55:52.477 --> 00:55:56.199]  Trump says 13 angry Democrats on the Mueller team should be wary.
[00:55:56.559 --> 00:55:57.120]  Close quote.
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:57.920]  He's absolutely right.
[00:56:01.144 --> 00:56:05.245]  Republicans in key election races turned down volume on Trump's tax cuts.
[00:56:05.926 --> 00:56:07.286]  Got a bunch of news on that I want to hit.
[00:56:07.306 --> 00:56:16.650]  A lot of idiot Republicans are running from Trump instead of running towards Trump, even though Democrats are running away from Hillary and away from the Democratic Party and towards Trump.
[00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:24.212]  But Republicans again are a bunch of intimidated, weak cowards by and large, other than the Freedom Caucus and others.
[00:56:24.252 --> 00:56:26.153]  They are a bunch of weak-kneed conformists.
[00:56:27.483 --> 00:56:31.527]  Who still watch mainstream media and still believe it, and don't know it's all a giant hoax.
[00:56:32.488 --> 00:56:41.136]  Alright, I promise I'm going to Emmy, and I'm going to Lacey, and I'm going to Alex, and Casey, and everybody when we come back.
[00:56:41.176 --> 00:56:45.660]  I'm gonna get your calls, I promise, when we start the next hour.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.862]  I'm going boom, boom, boom, your calls.
[00:56:48.022 --> 00:56:48.343]  And then,
[00:56:51.098 --> 00:57:02.884]  I pulled the new study that's in AP, and I pulled some of the old studies about Democrats being meaner, lazier, stealing more, killing more, lying more, and worse for the environment.
[00:57:02.964 --> 00:57:04.565]  And it's AP admitting it.
[00:57:06.306 --> 00:57:08.927]  Modern liberals are virtue signaling liars.
[00:57:09.728 --> 00:57:10.528]  They're frauds.
[00:57:10.868 --> 00:57:11.529]  They're fakes.
[00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.869]  They're hoaxers.
[00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:13.970]  They're posers.
[00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:15.371]  They don't bring it.
[00:57:16.471 --> 00:57:17.532]  Trump is bringing it.
[00:57:18.487 --> 00:57:20.030]  Infowars is bringing it!
[00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:22.093]  Drudge Report is bringing it!
[00:57:22.794 --> 00:57:24.257]  Tucker Carlson is bringing it!
[00:57:26.271 --> 00:57:27.151]  Who else is bringing it?
[00:57:27.711 --> 00:57:28.412]  Sean Hannity.
[00:57:28.712 --> 00:57:31.452]  And again, Michael Savage is bringing it.
[00:57:31.772 --> 00:57:33.113]  Why are we up here talking about these people?
[00:57:33.313 --> 00:57:34.293]  Because they're bringing it!
[00:57:34.593 --> 00:57:44.195]  They're bringing the victory in the face of the attacks, in the face of the censorship, and I need your hopes and prayers, I need your support, and you're bringing it, so we thank you for supporting the InfoWar.

[00:58:10.566 --> 00:58:16.892]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[01:00:07.254 --> 01:00:08.615]  We shall fight in France.
[01:00:09.636 --> 01:00:11.697]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:17.262]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[01:00:18.743 --> 01:00:21.986]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

[01:00:31.356 --> 01:00:32.837]  We shall fight in the hills.
[01:00:33.798 --> 01:00:35.118]  We shall never surrender!
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:43.444]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:59.904 --> 01:01:01.645]  All right, we're going right to your phone calls.
[01:01:01.685 --> 01:01:07.008]  We also have these breaking Millie Weaver reports that are coming up that are in HD.
[01:01:07.209 --> 01:01:11.811]  You saw her live reports the last few days from the migrant caravan that's still arriving with the thousands.
[01:01:13.112 --> 01:01:21.898]  But she has dozens and dozens of people, including Islamists, Muslims, admitting, we're here for money, we're here for jobs, we're here for welfare.
[01:01:23.078 --> 01:01:25.020]  We are not fearing for our lives.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.861]  We are not refugees.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:36.294]  But you gotta hand it to them, at least they're being honest, and it doesn't mean I don't feel sorry for them, but they're being used as human weapons to be socialized by the globalists to collapse us!
[01:01:38.097 --> 01:01:40.401]  So, very powerful reports coming up right now.
[01:01:41.496 --> 01:01:47.221]  We've got Alex and Casey and Emmy and Paul and Lacey and a bunch of other calls.
[01:01:47.281 --> 01:01:48.322]  I can't see me move that down.
[01:01:48.362 --> 01:01:48.702]  Thank you.
[01:01:49.343 --> 01:01:53.787]  And so right now, let's go ahead and go to Lacey in Tampa, Florida.
[01:01:54.067 --> 01:02:00.673]  I've been asking the question, what will the globalists do now that their whole agenda is falling apart worldwide and Trump is succeeding?
[01:02:01.133 --> 01:02:07.659]  What are they going to do now that Mueller's been exposed as a fraud by three judges, excuse me, three judges in just the last four days?
[01:02:07.899 --> 01:02:08.500]  What's going to happen?
[01:02:10.276 --> 01:02:11.677]  Wow, what an honor, Alex.
[01:02:11.757 --> 01:02:12.418]  Oh my goodness.
[01:02:12.818 --> 01:02:14.379]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.180]  Please, Lacey.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:16.681]  Wonderful.
[01:02:16.901 --> 01:02:23.406]  I think that right now, they are absolutely desperate, and they're at their most dangerous.
[01:02:23.426 --> 01:02:25.147]  That's what scares me the most.
[01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:27.609]  They never thought they were going to get to this place.
[01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.131]  They never thought that she was going to lose.
[01:02:30.611 --> 01:02:36.296]  Now everything they've done is exposed, and it's just a really dangerous time.
[01:02:36.316 --> 01:02:38.878]  I agree, and listen.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.201]  Vegas was an Islamic terror attack.
[01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:47.263]  They used a gun dealer who had been in the Middle East, probably CIA operative, at least a cutout.
[01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:50.364]  I got that directly from the hostage rescue team the first few days.
[01:02:50.745 --> 01:02:52.225]  And then of course the evidence all came out.
[01:02:52.685 --> 01:02:55.907]  And then they just covered that up and then moved on to the next thing, a stand down.
[01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:57.007]  It happened.
[01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:02.230]  The shooting happened, but they stood down there in Parkland.
[01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:06.371]  And so clearly, I think they're gearing up for something much, much bigger.
[01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:07.692]  What does your gut tell you, Lacey?
[01:03:09.358 --> 01:03:10.899]  It's just really scary right now.
[01:03:11.599 --> 01:03:17.342]  I feel like they've already been caught and they don't want to let us know about it because it's just that bad.
[01:03:17.722 --> 01:03:18.722]  At least that's what I hope.
[01:03:19.263 --> 01:03:33.449]  I hope that Trump knows exactly what's going on and right now he's quietly preparing to combat whatever they throw at us because it's hard to believe that it is kind of quiet on that front.
[01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.771]  We don't seem to be pushing back really hard right now.
[01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:44.241]  And I'm just really praying that we're quietly preparing for whatever they're willing to throw at us, and it's going to be anything.
[01:03:44.781 --> 01:03:53.344]  They are going to go low, and they're literally making conspiracy theories reality right now as we live, and it's scary.
[01:03:55.385 --> 01:03:55.825]  You're right.
[01:03:55.885 --> 01:03:57.246]  This is an incredible time.
[01:03:57.266 --> 01:04:00.187]  There's a lot of opportunity, but it's also incredibly dangerous.
[01:04:00.867 --> 01:04:04.549]  The globalists all over the world thought they'd set up a huge private corporate world government,
[01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:10.728]  Where governments transferred the power to it, where they'd be tax exempt, but diplomatic immunity.
[01:04:10.748 --> 01:04:12.849]  Well, the world's not buying into that anymore.
[01:04:13.909 --> 01:04:16.870]  And so they have an untenable authoritarian system.
[01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:22.731]  And they thought we were so diverted with Hollywood and movies and entertainment that we would buy this.
[01:04:22.811 --> 01:04:27.832]  Well, no, a large portion of people of every race, color and creed do not buy it.
[01:04:28.292 --> 01:04:31.233]  And so I don't see how they ever think they're going to put this back together again.
[01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:43.309]  Well, they really got sloppy because they thought that there was no chance in whatever that he was going to win, but he did, and definitely the silent majority.
[01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:48.371]  We've crossed the line, and we've got to keep stepping up to the plate.
[01:04:48.671 --> 01:04:49.051]  That's right.
[01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.572]  The human awakening has hit critical mass.
[01:04:51.612 --> 01:04:57.294]  We've crossed the point of return, but it's going to be some rough water, especially for those of us on the very front lines, tip of the spear.
[01:04:57.515 --> 01:04:59.295]  But it's a good price to pay, and I'm honored.
[01:04:59.755 --> 01:05:01.156]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:06.243]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:05:06.683 --> 01:05:07.983]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:05:08.484 --> 01:05:20.009]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:29.574]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:05:30.014 --> 01:05:35.858]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:05:36.078 --> 01:05:40.741]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.563]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:05:43.903 --> 01:05:45.264]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:05:45.644 --> 01:05:55.270]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:57.472]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[01:05:58.032 --> 01:06:02.914]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:06:10.276 --> 01:06:11.056]  Big Brother.
[01:06:12.397 --> 01:06:13.657]  Mainstream Media.
[01:06:15.178 --> 01:06:16.258]  Government Cover-Ups.
[01:06:17.762 --> 01:06:18.703]  You want answers?
[01:06:19.664 --> 01:06:20.665]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:27.993]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.491 --> 01:06:48.852]  Very important article on Infowars.com and Newswars.com right now.
[01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:55.634]  Trump tears into John Kerry over shadow diplomacy with Iran.
[01:06:55.674 --> 01:06:56.414]  This is just out.
[01:06:57.414 --> 01:07:00.435]  He was the one that created the mesh in the first place.
[01:07:02.055 --> 01:07:02.995]  And the deal is a mess.
[01:07:03.016 --> 01:07:04.816]  You can be against war with Iran.
[01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:19.388]  You can try to disagree with things BB has said, because it's so fashionable to attack him, but you can't deny that Kerry now admittedly is involved behind the scenes trying to sabotage a new deal with Iran.
[01:07:19.408 --> 01:07:33.676]  The United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal shadow diplomacy, and it violates the Logan Act, on the very badly negotiated Iran deal he was the one that created the mess in the first place Trump put out this morning.
[01:07:35.964 --> 01:07:38.005]  And that ties into this London Independent article.
[01:07:38.885 --> 01:07:41.507]  Obama is about to meet some of the world's most powerful leaders.
[01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:44.908]  November 28th of last year.
[01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:54.352]  And it said that he follows Trump around on foreign trips the day after Trump leaves, he arrives and meets with the very, very same people.
[01:07:56.013 --> 01:07:57.734]  That's not called shadow diplomacy.
[01:08:01.176 --> 01:08:04.097]  That's called the deep state.
[01:08:05.523 --> 01:08:10.265]  Going around saying, hey, don't agree with him, don't listen to him, he's not really the president.
[01:08:10.906 --> 01:08:17.108]  That's what Hayden, the former head of the CIA and the NSA, is in the news this last weekend saying.
[01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.929]  It's incredible.
[01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:28.574]  So now that you just joined us, that you got not one, not two, but three federal judges coming out saying Mueller is lying, Mueller's in a witch hunt, Mueller wants to impeach Trump.
[01:08:28.614 --> 01:08:29.174]  These are quotes.
[01:08:30.075 --> 01:08:31.655]  Mueller lied to Congress.
[01:08:34.057 --> 01:08:34.737]  What are they going to do?
[01:08:36.358 --> 01:08:41.402]  The cabal of 13 in the Justice Department and FBI of Democrats that rigged all this.
[01:08:41.902 --> 01:08:42.983]  Think of the arrogance!
[01:08:43.023 --> 01:08:44.084]  Think of the insolence!
[01:08:44.765 --> 01:08:48.968]  They thought, teamed up with the mainstream media and their people dug in, they could get away with this.
[01:08:49.008 --> 01:09:00.237]  Well, with each passing day... With each passing day, the federal judges will rebuke and rebuke and rebuke because this is dangerous if they get away with this.
[01:09:00.257 --> 01:09:02.999]  So, what are the rats leaving the sinking ship gonna do?
[01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:08.671]  We just talked to Lacey, right?
[01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:09.872]  We just talked to Lacey, correct?
[01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.095]  So we're done with Lacey now.
[01:09:14.815 --> 01:09:17.557]  We're going to go ahead and we're going to talk to...
[01:09:19.690 --> 01:09:22.011]  Paul in Oklahoma, then Emmy.
[01:09:22.331 --> 01:09:23.131]  Paul, you're on the air.
[01:09:23.151 --> 01:09:24.052]  What do you think they're going to do now?
[01:09:24.432 --> 01:09:35.937]  What will the cornered rats of the Clinton Stay Behind Network, the rogue government, that's what the federal judge called them on Friday, the head Russiagate judge, said, you're an unfettered power unto yourself, close quote.
[01:09:36.197 --> 01:09:46.801]  That means you are a runaway rogue power who's out of control and lying and who thinks he's God and who thinks he can impeach the president or whatever.
[01:09:47.201 --> 01:09:48.562]  Come on, man!
[01:09:49.824 --> 01:09:50.345]  That's a quote.
[01:09:51.085 --> 01:09:52.206]  So what are they going to do next, Paul?
[01:09:53.588 --> 01:09:58.172]  Well, my first, I had basically I had two emotions at the same time.
[01:09:58.272 --> 01:10:02.857]  First one was that I was so elated that this judge called out for me.
[01:10:02.897 --> 01:10:04.298]  I was just, I couldn't believe it.
[01:10:04.859 --> 01:10:09.803]  And then simultaneously, it was like I got hit in the gut and my emotion was, man, they're going to kill that man.
[01:10:09.823 --> 01:10:11.265]  Just like they killed Nathan Salia.
[01:10:11.765 --> 01:10:12.586]  That's what I thought.
[01:10:12.726 --> 01:10:14.448]  And I'm so elated and just,
[01:10:15.549 --> 01:10:21.171]  I'm so pumped up today, I just want to give a shout out to everybody listening to World Wide Big Info Wars.
[01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:22.232]  Oh yeah!
[01:10:22.272 --> 01:10:23.072]  We're going to win!
[01:10:23.272 --> 01:10:24.013]  God bless you, Paul.
[01:10:24.033 --> 01:10:24.713]  Appreciate the call.
[01:10:25.693 --> 01:10:30.916]  Yeah, I said day one, we had our crew down there within 24 hours of Scalia dying.
[01:10:31.396 --> 01:10:33.036]  They didn't tell us he was dead for about 20 hours.
[01:10:33.577 --> 01:10:40.800]  But we drove to South Texas, put up our drones, everything, got into the hotel, and they got really upset and kicked us out.
[01:10:42.128 --> 01:10:45.430]  And top globalist got special awards from Obama.
[01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:46.911]  I'm not saying anything to do with the death.
[01:10:46.931 --> 01:10:47.952]  Of course not.
[01:10:48.292 --> 01:10:51.374]  Weird devil signs, devil mask everywhere.
[01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:54.456]  Bizarre little beds out in the hallways.
[01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:55.457]  Just really weird stuff.
[01:10:55.497 --> 01:10:58.239]  And I said, this is like Bohemian Grove of Texas.
[01:10:58.299 --> 01:10:59.159]  We learned it was.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:08.205]  And then it came out a month later in the Washington Post that it is a branch of Bohemian Grove and a secret society.
[01:11:09.646 --> 01:11:10.747]  They just want everybody to know.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:19.563]  So we even guessed what it was, because I know these people so well, and it's just crazy.
[01:11:21.843 --> 01:11:22.604]  Good, good points.
[01:11:22.644 --> 01:11:23.024]  Thank you.
[01:11:25.545 --> 01:11:26.485]  What are they going to do now?
[01:11:26.505 --> 01:11:29.206]  Let's talk to Emmy in Branson, Missouri.
[01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:30.086]  Emmy, you're on the air.
[01:11:30.106 --> 01:11:30.446]  Welcome.
[01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:32.907]  Hey, Alex.
[01:11:33.007 --> 01:11:33.468]  Hello.
[01:11:33.728 --> 01:11:34.328]  Thanks for calling.
[01:11:35.288 --> 01:11:40.110]  Hey, what I'm thinking of is that, you know, the globalists have to mask the truth that's coming out.
[01:11:40.985 --> 01:11:47.047]  And we've done massacres and the schools aren't working and the people are waking up to the anti-gun agenda.
[01:11:47.267 --> 01:11:48.187]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:11:48.227 --> 01:11:50.968]  Oh, you're awesome!
[01:11:51.388 --> 01:12:00.030]  What I think they're going to do is some kind of, they're going to create with technology some kind of natural disaster in the red states, northern the west coast, the east coast.
[01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:04.611]  So that's going to be like a HAARP, CMS, or underground nuke.
[01:12:05.452 --> 01:12:06.532]  Red takedown with an EMF.
[01:12:07.817 --> 01:12:11.042]  And so that's going to take up the news cycle for about a month and people are going to die.
[01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:12.464]  Great point, Emmy.
[01:12:12.504 --> 01:12:13.826]  Let me back you up on that.
[01:12:15.569 --> 01:12:21.859]  And of course, we'll probably run a headline saying Jones says Deep State will use weather weapons to distract from Trump's successes.
[01:12:23.524 --> 01:12:42.712]  I'm saying Secretary of Defense William Cohen in April 17th of 1997 told the Army Times in a press conference that major governments have weather weapons and even tectonic and volcanic weapons that they have where they can manipulate and control the weather and tectonic events and that the U.S.
[01:12:42.752 --> 01:12:43.472]  was facing that.
[01:12:45.188 --> 01:12:48.831]  So, yes, we use weather weapons in Vietnam on Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[01:12:49.151 --> 01:12:50.812]  I'm not saying they're going to do that.
[01:12:50.832 --> 01:12:57.457]  You know, a woman called like five years ago when there was a record hurricane, excuse me, tornado, hit Oklahoma City.
[01:12:58.218 --> 01:13:00.700]  And she said, I think it's, you know, I think Obama did it.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.662]  I said, no, ma'am, that's in, that's in the tornado alley.
[01:13:03.822 --> 01:13:05.644]  Oklahoma City is probably the center of tornado alley.
[01:13:05.884 --> 01:13:09.527]  It runs all the way up from Illinois right down to, it ends at about San Antonio.
[01:13:10.575 --> 01:13:14.316]  Well, since when do we have the new Madrid with the earthquake that just happened?
[01:13:14.336 --> 01:13:15.456]  What the heck's going on with that?
[01:13:17.597 --> 01:13:18.597]  I hear you, Emmy.
[01:13:18.617 --> 01:13:19.578]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:19.638 --> 01:13:20.198]  Great points.
[01:13:22.778 --> 01:13:26.259]  I'm not saying they're going to do it, but they say they have these technologies.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:35.422]  Just like BBC, 23 years ago, I was reading BBC articles about human clones to the embryonic level and how they were implanting them in cows.
[01:13:36.977 --> 01:13:39.217]  And then I talk about it, they go, Jones is crazy.
[01:13:39.477 --> 01:13:40.998]  That's 23-year-old news.
[01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:48.619]  And in that article I read on air 23 years ago, they said that Britain had been doing it in labs for 15 years.
[01:13:50.839 --> 01:13:52.000]  That's almost 40 years.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.161]  And again, they don't call it chemtrailing, they call it geoengineering.
[01:13:59.721 --> 01:14:00.561]  And yeah, there's the quote.
[01:14:00.981 --> 01:14:04.082]  Weather weapons have existed for over 15 years, testified U.S.
[01:14:04.282 --> 01:14:05.202]  Secretary of Defense.
[01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:06.381]  There you go.
[01:14:06.401 --> 01:14:09.503]  There's an article about it from Natural News of all places.
[01:14:10.923 --> 01:14:12.444]  And I mean, I'm not making this stuff up.
[01:14:13.725 --> 01:14:16.646]  Okay, let's go to Casey in Ontario, Canada.
[01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:18.907]  Casey, you're on the air on another subject, but go ahead.
[01:14:18.947 --> 01:14:19.248]  Welcome.
[01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:21.008]  Alex, how you doing, buddy?
[01:14:21.168 --> 01:14:21.749]  Good, my friend.
[01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:23.850]  I have a couple questions for you.
[01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:30.053]  I just, uh, well, for one, just on the supplements, I finally budged and I probably spent, you know, five or six hundred bucks there.
[01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:39.438]  Last couple weeks on the InfoWars store, I got Caveman, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the Prebiotic, and I got quite a few things.
[01:14:39.498 --> 01:14:40.038]  I love them all.
[01:14:40.078 --> 01:14:41.419]  Bodies is probably my favorite.
[01:14:42.099 --> 01:14:46.461]  My one question about the supplements would be, is there a big difference between Biome Defense and Floralife?
[01:14:50.250 --> 01:15:02.094]  They're both top-of-the-line formulas, wide-spectrum strains, and are the best that we can find from two different big suppliers, and they can argue all day about which one's better.
[01:15:03.615 --> 01:15:12.538]  I can tell you this, that the count in Floralife is they've got to be able to say they're $50 billion in like a year.
[01:15:13.723 --> 01:15:16.305]  And so, even if it's in regular temperature, not cold.
[01:15:16.765 --> 01:15:25.170]  And so, I know for a fact Floralife has a much higher count, so that it will guaranteed in a year be at $50 billion.
[01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:32.359]  The other one's great as well, and it's got a count much, much higher.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.440]  And in a year, it's still $50 billion.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.801]  But I can tell you, Floralife, it's like way above that.
[01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:40.082]  Floralife is super strong.
[01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:41.923]  You can argue about the strains, though.
[01:15:41.963 --> 01:15:42.803]  It's two different formulas.
[01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:45.164]  So I think it's really up to you to decide for yourself.
[01:15:45.184 --> 01:15:47.305]  Stay there, because I want to get to your other point when we come back.
[01:15:47.345 --> 01:15:48.346]  That's really a great question.
[01:15:49.866 --> 01:15:53.328]  Yeah, it's... Bottom defense is excellent.
[01:15:54.269 --> 01:15:58.747]  It's a really, really, really fancy group of strains and then Floralife is ultra strong.
[01:15:59.129 --> 01:15:59.570]  We'll be back.
[01:15:59.591 --> 01:15:59.912]  Stay with us.

[01:16:29.256 --> 01:16:29.736]  We all do.
[01:16:29.957 --> 01:16:34.099]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[01:16:34.119 --> 01:16:35.520]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:39.643]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[01:16:39.683 --> 01:16:41.004]  And again, you look at the studies.
[01:16:41.224 --> 01:16:47.348]  Testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[01:16:48.175 --> 01:16:57.161]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.
[01:16:57.342 --> 01:17:05.467]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthraplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.

[01:18:05.168 --> 01:18:07.009]  Desiree, thanks for holding your on the air from California.
[01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:07.310]  Go ahead.
[01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:11.333]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[01:18:11.473 --> 01:18:16.497]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[01:18:17.037 --> 01:18:22.581]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[01:18:23.422 --> 01:18:31.668]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[01:18:32.348 --> 01:18:35.231]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:39.534]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[01:18:39.634 --> 01:18:46.459]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[01:18:47.119 --> 01:18:51.260]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.981]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[01:18:55.661 --> 01:18:59.922]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[01:19:00.422 --> 01:19:06.024]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[01:19:06.064 --> 01:19:10.585]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[01:19:11.459 --> 01:19:12.781]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:18.288]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[01:19:18.308 --> 01:19:19.649]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[01:19:19.689 --> 01:19:19.830]  Yeah.
[01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:21.852]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[01:19:21.892 --> 01:19:22.713]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[01:19:22.753 --> 01:19:24.455]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[01:19:24.475 --> 01:19:25.657]  We really appreciate you.
[01:19:25.817 --> 01:19:26.498]  Keep up the fight.
[01:19:26.538 --> 01:19:27.940]  We need to take California back.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.340]  Thank you, Desiree.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.442]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[01:19:29.502 --> 01:19:30.102]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[01:19:32.085 --> 01:19:38.970]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:48.976]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken, and it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[01:19:49.036 --> 01:19:52.018]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[01:19:52.259 --> 01:19:53.479]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:20:01.625]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:20:05.657 --> 01:20:08.265]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:38.174 --> 01:20:39.274]  Warrior calls coming up.
[01:20:40.634 --> 01:20:47.616]  We have Idaho Congressional District 1 candidate who is in second in the primary of seven people.
[01:20:48.816 --> 01:20:53.817]  Michael Snyder popping in to talk about the blue wave that's faltering and a lot more he'll be popping in.
[01:20:53.837 --> 01:21:04.619]  But at the start of the next segment, I'm going to play one of the three powerful reports that Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz, who've got such incredible nerves of steel, they went into the immigrant caravan
[01:21:05.697 --> 01:21:14.883]  Which had coyotes and others involved in it, smugglers, with an InfoWars flag on the Mexican side of the border in Tijuana.
[01:21:14.923 --> 01:21:16.344]  Let me tell you, that's not safe.
[01:21:17.064 --> 01:21:21.487]  So I'm going to tell them, they are contractors, they do a great job, stop it.
[01:21:22.268 --> 01:21:23.549]  That is not safe.
[01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:24.911]  At all.
[01:21:25.451 --> 01:21:30.152]  Because it's not the little migrants that are bad, it's the people controlling them that you've got to really watch out for.
[01:21:30.212 --> 01:21:41.495]  So, I don't want to get into any details here, but let me just tell you, MS-13 and others, we were told by the FBI across the border when we met with the FBI two years ago, we were asked not to talk about it.
[01:21:41.515 --> 01:21:42.135]  Let me just say this.
[01:21:42.735 --> 01:21:45.815]  Nobody should be in Mexico with an Infowars flag on the border.
[01:21:46.636 --> 01:21:47.336]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:21:48.716 --> 01:21:50.436]  And I told Gavin and I told Millie that.
[01:21:51.297 --> 01:21:52.177]  And I'm not mad at them.
[01:21:52.197 --> 01:21:53.297]  How can you be mad at people with courage?
[01:21:54.682 --> 01:21:56.584]  Except I want them to not get killed!
[01:21:59.146 --> 01:22:04.310]  So, this is powerful footage because CNN only shows a mother with children and says, oh, she's scared.
[01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.570]  No.
[01:22:05.851 --> 01:22:07.852]  This shows what the people actually say.
[01:22:09.353 --> 01:22:11.255]  The number one group, by the way, in the U.S.
[01:22:11.275 --> 01:22:13.116]  now, of any one group, is Chinese women.
[01:22:13.377 --> 01:22:16.299]  CNN reported that three years ago and I've checked the latest numbers, it's even worse.
[01:22:16.919 --> 01:22:19.962]  And it's middle class Chinese women that are allowed to leave their country.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:31.206]  They keep dual citizenship, they come here, check into a hotel, two weeks before they have the baby, they have the baby, becomes a citizen, everything is paid for for free, and then they sit there and milk off the U.S.
[01:22:31.627 --> 01:22:34.168]  This is... What are we, schmucks here?
[01:22:35.029 --> 01:22:36.230]  The biggest idiots on the planet?
[01:22:37.551 --> 01:22:39.312]  I can't go to China or Mexico and do that?
[01:22:39.392 --> 01:22:40.092]  I'm sick of it!
[01:22:42.794 --> 01:22:43.975]  Alright, who's up next here?
[01:22:46.479 --> 01:22:47.320]  Who are we talking to?
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:48.440]  We're talking to a caller in Canada.
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:49.361]  He wanted to get into Joe Rogan.
[01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.642]  He was talking about the products and asking questions.
[01:22:51.702 --> 01:22:58.166]  I did a survey during the break of the crew back there in the control room on who was taking it and who they talked to that was taking it.
[01:22:58.746 --> 01:23:04.270]  And it looks like Floralife is more popular than Biome Defense.
[01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:07.191]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:23:07.251 --> 01:23:10.954]  You need to take different high-quality probiotics to get a mix of things, in my view.
[01:23:10.974 --> 01:23:12.474]  But they're both excellent probiotics.
[01:23:12.715 --> 01:23:16.036]  The MycoZX is amazing to knock out the mold and other garbage.
[01:23:16.377 --> 01:23:16.937]  Infowarshore.com.
[01:23:16.957 --> 01:23:17.897]  I'm not going to plug anymore.
[01:23:17.917 --> 01:23:18.418]  He just brought it up.
[01:23:18.778 --> 01:23:20.419]  I just want to finish this question, though.
[01:23:20.479 --> 01:23:21.019]  Casey, go ahead.
[01:23:21.039 --> 01:23:21.960]  You have a Joe Rogan question.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:22.260]  Go ahead.
[01:23:23.461 --> 01:23:25.682]  Yeah, and I didn't doubt the quality of the product.
[01:23:25.722 --> 01:23:28.263]  I'm just curious if I should be taking them both at the same time, Alex.
[01:23:28.363 --> 01:23:28.844]  That was all.
[01:23:29.464 --> 01:23:30.985]  Well, I mean, have you tried the products?
[01:23:31.713 --> 01:23:32.614]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:39.778]  I just, I didn't take, I just wasn't sure if I should be taking that many probiotics at once, so I just stuck to the Floralife and the Mycos-DX and the prebiotic there.
[01:23:39.798 --> 01:23:44.400]  I've been taking that for the last two weeks, and I thought I'd hold on to the Biome Defense until I'm done the Floralife.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:48.182]  Sure, well, I mean, did, did, so, so, I mean, what's your, what's your review?
[01:23:49.563 --> 01:23:57.127]  Uh, I, I'm loving everything, like, without getting into the details, like, uh, I just feel less bloated, less crampy, just, I don't know, I just feel better.
[01:23:57.147 --> 01:24:00.049]  Oh, I gotta tell you, I remember my whole life
[01:24:01.894 --> 01:24:09.339]  Even though I eat pretty good food and stuff, like kind of having stomach aches here and there and driving home, you know, like, oh man, I feel bad that you don't need to use the bathroom or whatever.
[01:24:09.579 --> 01:24:10.419]  You just feel like you do.
[01:24:10.439 --> 01:24:11.920]  Everybody knows that feeling.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:18.964]  And since I got divorced, because I was already doing some health stuff, but I got really unhealthy and gained 90 something pounds.
[01:24:20.465 --> 01:24:27.129]  My girlfriend, now my wife, she said, listen, you got to take probiotics.
[01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:28.050]  And I already knew that.
[01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.932]  And it was like, yeah!
[01:24:29.972 --> 01:24:33.138]  So I started taking them, and then it totally changed my life!
[01:24:33.659 --> 01:24:37.126]  And then my stomach used to hurt probably every other day here and there, no big deal.
[01:24:37.547 --> 01:24:37.787]  Now...
[01:24:39.298 --> 01:24:41.460]  My stomach might hurt twice a year.
[01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:47.227]  I mean, it is that dramatic that the pesticides in the food kill the good flora.
[01:24:47.267 --> 01:24:48.188]  You've got to replace it.
[01:24:48.548 --> 01:24:49.650]  It's absolutely true.
[01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:53.954]  And yogurt and sauerkraut, that has some of it, but nothing compared to a good probiotic.
[01:24:53.974 --> 01:24:54.795]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:24:55.116 --> 01:24:57.038]  And folks, if you don't try our probiotic, fine.
[01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:00.241]  Just get a highly rated one because it's amazing.
[01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:00.502]  Go ahead.
[01:25:01.654 --> 01:25:04.176]  I think Prostagard is very underrated as well.
[01:25:04.236 --> 01:25:06.277]  I found that worked tremendously for me.
[01:25:06.457 --> 01:25:12.101]  And I'm a young man, like I shouldn't need to be taking these things yet, but even so, I feel like... Oh, you definitely notice the difference.
[01:25:12.141 --> 01:25:14.803]  There's so many chemicals in the environment that attack the prostate.
[01:25:15.703 --> 01:25:19.285]  And even the FDA lets you say Shaw Palmetto is great for your prostate.
[01:25:19.486 --> 01:25:21.267]  It's not just good for that, it's good for a bunch of glands.
[01:25:21.707 --> 01:25:24.569]  And a lot of men who aren't even above 40, they take
[01:25:25.209 --> 01:25:32.071]  Salt Palmetto, and ours is a really strong version of it with a bunch of other added herbs, so it's supercharged, because it just makes life a lot better.
[01:25:32.091 --> 01:25:32.791]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:25:33.311 --> 01:25:33.691]  I agree.
[01:25:34.532 --> 01:25:40.673]  So I know time's limited, but yours is hard to call into as rushed these days, so I just want to make a couple points while I got you here.
[01:25:41.534 --> 01:25:44.735]  The thing about Rogan was more or less just I loved hearing you.
[01:25:44.755 --> 01:25:46.395]  I love InfoWars.
[01:25:46.435 --> 01:25:47.996]  I love your show, the four-hour show every day.
[01:25:48.036 --> 01:25:49.176]  It gets me through work every day.
[01:25:49.216 --> 01:25:52.837]  But just to hear you talk about things in an open setting freely,
[01:25:53.717 --> 01:25:57.423]  Dive a little bit more into the conspiracy side of things, philosophy, history.
[01:25:57.483 --> 01:26:02.932]  I know how knowledgeable you are on history, because you do get into it a lot of the time on here.
[01:26:02.972 --> 01:26:05.176]  I just found it so refreshing to hear you in that light.
[01:26:05.822 --> 01:26:09.986]  And I know how busy you are and everything, but it'd just be really cool if you kind of got into that more.
[01:26:10.006 --> 01:26:18.795]  I don't know if you could do it on and maybe start another hour program or you just talked about those things, because I know this is more... We are finishing, we are finishing a more personal studio.
[01:26:18.815 --> 01:26:21.258]  It's still gonna be high-tech, but it's gonna be personal.
[01:26:21.278 --> 01:26:25.662]  I'm gonna go in and basically commercial-free at least once a week, probably at night.
[01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:35.844]  Go for hours and take calls and take questions and really get into all the esoteric and all the weird stuff because people want to hear that and you know it's background for everything so you're totally right.
[01:26:36.244 --> 01:26:40.891]  As for Joe Rogan, I've known Joe since 1998 and he's been a good friend since about 2000.
[01:26:42.679 --> 01:26:42.879]  Yeah.
[01:26:58.176 --> 01:27:02.981]  I know Joe's super busy and I don't bug him a lot, but I text message him and then no response.
[01:27:03.082 --> 01:27:06.886]  And then like a month later he'll text message me back saying, oh yeah, I want you on, sorry I've been busy.
[01:27:06.906 --> 01:27:10.469]  And then he'll have like Steven Crowder on a few months ago and yeah, I want Alex on.
[01:27:10.489 --> 01:27:11.470]  He needs to come on.
[01:27:12.031 --> 01:27:13.372]  Sorry when I was off so I didn't see him.
[01:27:13.392 --> 01:27:15.074]  Well, I didn't even really call Joe when he was here in town.
[01:27:15.134 --> 01:27:16.235]  I figure he's busy.
[01:27:16.516 --> 01:27:18.678]  I've told Joe, I guess I'm not going to call you anymore.
[01:27:18.718 --> 01:27:19.759]  If you want me on, call me.
[01:27:19.819 --> 01:27:20.139]  I'm done.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:27.282]  Uh, but then, so then I get a weird call or I get a, you know, weird text where I'm driving through a hamburger place, you know, a few months ago.
[01:27:27.302 --> 01:27:28.363]  He's like, yeah, I want to get you on.
[01:27:28.403 --> 01:27:30.263]  And then no, no, it never happens.
[01:27:30.684 --> 01:27:31.264]  So I don't know.
[01:27:31.344 --> 01:27:32.384]  Joe's a really busy guy.
[01:27:32.764 --> 01:27:34.085]  He has one of the biggest shows out there.
[01:27:34.105 --> 01:27:42.248]  But the reason I need to get on that show is it, I reach our giant audience, but the media represents what I say everywhere.
[01:27:43.559 --> 01:27:43.759]  I don't
[01:27:59.912 --> 01:28:07.117]  I know he got attacked for having me on, and so it just becomes mysterious after the number one podcast he's ever had on back in February of last year.
[01:28:07.137 --> 01:28:08.799]  We're talking 14, 15 months ago.
[01:28:09.479 --> 01:28:14.023]  And then it's great, he has Eddie Bravo on every other week about his, you know, fun stuff.
[01:28:14.583 --> 01:28:20.047]  And Joey Diaz, who are both my friends, I mean, I used to go out to Vegas with them, Houston, you know, I mean, you name it.
[01:28:20.508 --> 01:28:23.390]  I mean, I've hung out with those guys and partied with them a lot over the years.
[01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:25.291]  And Bravo will come here.
[01:28:25.351 --> 01:28:26.172]  I mean, I love Bravo.
[01:28:26.192 --> 01:28:26.712]  He's a good friend.
[01:28:26.732 --> 01:28:27.233]  He's hilarious.
[01:28:28.359 --> 01:28:31.542]  Joe Rogan, you know, basically, no more contact with him.
[01:28:32.303 --> 01:28:36.587]  Just an occasional, oh, I want to get Alex on, or occasional text message, hey buddy, like the show.
[01:28:36.988 --> 01:28:37.348]  Okay.
[01:28:37.869 --> 01:28:38.549]  So that's fine.
[01:28:38.729 --> 01:28:39.710]  Joe, you don't need to send those.
[01:28:39.991 --> 01:28:41.913]  Kind of like Trump calling me up, telling me how great I am.
[01:28:41.953 --> 01:28:42.793]  I said, sir, you're busy.
[01:28:43.194 --> 01:28:44.275]  If you got something you need, call me.
[01:28:44.295 --> 01:28:45.116]  You don't need to call me anymore.
[01:28:45.456 --> 01:28:46.437]  My wife heard that phone call.
[01:28:46.457 --> 01:28:48.178]  She goes, wow, you just told the president I don't need to call you anymore.
[01:28:48.498 --> 01:28:49.359]  I'm not acting cool.
[01:28:49.399 --> 01:28:50.860]  You don't have to pat me on the head.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:51.881]  Do your own thing.
[01:28:51.901 --> 01:28:52.421]  You want me on?
[01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:53.002]  Call me, Joe.
[01:28:53.442 --> 01:28:55.924]  I'm not calling Joe or texting him ever again until I hear from him.
[01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:56.945]  All right, folks.
[01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:57.765]  We'll be back.
[01:28:57.845 --> 01:28:58.546]  Stay with us.
[01:28:59.207 --> 01:29:00.187]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:02.529 --> 01:29:03.370]  Mike in Arizona.
[01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:04.410]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:04.751]  Go ahead.
[01:29:05.658 --> 01:29:07.560]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:17.008]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:21.472]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:29:21.912 --> 01:29:22.192]  Absolutely.
[01:29:44.696 --> 01:29:57.618]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:30:04.082 --> 01:30:04.522]  We're good to go.
[01:30:04.542 --> 01:30:05.163]  We're good to go.

[01:30:18.654 --> 01:30:19.094]  We're good to go.
[01:30:19.154 --> 01:30:20.415]  We're good to go.
[01:30:20.435 --> 01:30:20.896]  We're good to go.
[01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:21.296]  We're good to go.
[01:30:21.356 --> 01:30:22.217]  We're good to go.

[01:32:16.748 --> 01:32:18.589]  We're only dependent on you.
[01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:19.809]  I say it over and over again.
[01:32:20.269 --> 01:32:24.151]  You said on CNN, half the ads are for Gulf state dictatorships.
[01:32:24.251 --> 01:32:25.232]  That's who's paying them.
[01:32:25.932 --> 01:32:32.735]  Pharmaceutical companies, you know, Black Lives Matter groups, left-wing Soros groups funded by giant globalist checks.
[01:32:33.435 --> 01:32:42.057]  Then you have, you know, conservative networks that are funded by sponsors which get boycotted on a regular basis by left-wing mob outrage campaigns.
[01:32:42.677 --> 01:32:48.258]  They can't really do that to us because everything's in-house and you support us.
[01:32:48.699 --> 01:32:50.859]  You continue to support us over the past few years.
[01:32:50.919 --> 01:32:51.879]  It's been really helpful.
[01:32:52.159 --> 01:32:54.040]  It's enabled us to survive, basically.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:59.221]  We really appreciate it, so please continue to do so by getting the products out in 4WallStore.com.
[01:33:06.682 --> 01:33:09.298]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:36.204 --> 01:33:40.145]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:40.225 --> 01:33:42.546]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:44.266 --> 01:33:47.387]  So here we are inside the migrant caravan.
[01:33:48.087 --> 01:33:57.769]  Many of these people here are from Honduras and have been given a 30-day pass from the Mexican government so they can make their way up to
[01:34:00.456 --> 01:34:01.977]  The border where we're at right now.
[01:34:01.997 --> 01:34:02.297]  Okay.
[01:34:02.317 --> 01:34:05.898]  So are they pretty hopeful that they're gonna be allowed in as well?
[01:34:19.386 --> 01:34:28.411]  Since they came in a TV and all that, and there are people, they're all over the country now, so people are coming over here from different states, different countries to feed them.
[01:34:28.911 --> 01:34:34.834]  And these people, the one that's supplying this, they just came right now for, I don't know from where, but they're supplying everything.
[01:34:35.094 --> 01:34:36.794]  The Latina Muslim Foundation.
[01:34:36.834 --> 01:34:38.915]  Now, I wonder if that's an American foundation.
[01:34:39.215 --> 01:34:43.236]  How did you guys raise funds to come help with food and water and aid?
[01:34:44.597 --> 01:34:49.338]  We do some events and we ask the mosque in San Diego.
[01:34:49.558 --> 01:34:55.680]  Have you heard any of the people here say that they're scared or that they don't feel safe here?
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.000]  No, no, no, no.
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:59.901]  No, actually, I didn't hear anything.
[01:35:00.201 --> 01:35:03.742]  Is he scared or fearful while he's here in Mexico to stay here?
[01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:09.455]  Aren't you afraid that something might happen to you here in Mexico?
[01:35:10.056 --> 01:35:11.096]  No, not here.
[01:35:11.777 --> 01:35:12.017]  No?
[01:35:12.217 --> 01:35:12.697]  No.
[01:35:12.918 --> 01:35:13.218]  Safe.
[01:35:13.858 --> 01:35:16.039]  Do you want to cross to the other side?
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:17.320]  Yes, we're waiting.
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:20.282]  Do you have a permit or papers?
[01:35:21.623 --> 01:35:26.666]  We're asking for political assistance.
[01:35:26.766 --> 01:35:29.488]  And you... Are you safe?
[01:35:29.828 --> 01:35:29.928]  Yes.
[01:35:31.989 --> 01:35:39.782]  To the United States, so he's gonna try to see if he could go across and maybe looking for a better life.
[01:35:40.323 --> 01:35:41.044]  The Honduras.
[01:35:41.685 --> 01:35:42.246]  Honduras?
[01:35:42.266 --> 01:35:42.566]  So...
[01:35:45.958 --> 01:35:47.659]  Do you feel safe here in Mexico?
[01:35:47.679 --> 01:35:55.586]  He doesn't feel safe here in Mexico.
[01:35:56.067 --> 01:35:56.227]  Why?
[01:35:56.267 --> 01:35:58.369]  Because he thinks there's a lot of violence.
[01:35:59.329 --> 01:36:04.894]  All he wants is to go to the United States, but that's just a saying.
[01:36:05.495 --> 01:36:07.637]  So they can go to the United States.
[01:36:08.457 --> 01:36:09.437]  Where are you guys from?
[01:36:09.957 --> 01:36:10.538]  El Salvador.
[01:36:11.118 --> 01:36:11.858]  El Salvador.
[01:36:12.338 --> 01:36:16.219]  Why do you want to come to America, United States?
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:22.961]  Looking for a better future.
[01:36:23.381 --> 01:36:24.622]  How has it been in Mexico?
[01:36:24.662 --> 01:36:25.562]  Do you feel safe here?
[01:36:27.057 --> 01:36:29.559]  How has Mexico treated you?
[01:36:29.599 --> 01:36:32.100]  Well, thank God, they've treated me well.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.983]  The places we've been to, they've always given us something to eat.
[01:36:37.003 --> 01:36:38.984]  They've given us something for the cold.
[01:36:39.024 --> 01:36:42.787]  There have been places where we've stayed to rest.
[01:36:44.168 --> 01:36:46.309]  Mexico's been kind to him.
[01:36:46.349 --> 01:36:49.971]  They've given food and blankets and clothes.
[01:36:50.652 --> 01:36:54.894]  So, you know, he feels safe in Mexico.
[01:36:55.134 --> 01:36:55.855]  Where are you from?
[01:36:58.132 --> 01:37:02.297]  They're from El Salvador, and Mexico's been treating them nice.
[01:37:02.597 --> 01:37:03.177]  What do you want?
[01:37:03.518 --> 01:37:06.201]  Ask them, do they feel safe here in Mexico?
[01:37:06.221 --> 01:37:13.348]  If they can't go across, they'd rather stay right here in Mexico.
[01:37:21.371 --> 01:37:23.213]  Now we're told they're all fleeing.
[01:37:49.005 --> 01:37:54.246]  Political persecution, like folks running from the old Soviet Union, like Darien in the control room.
[01:37:54.807 --> 01:37:58.347]  But that's not the case, ladies and gentlemen, and we went down and we showed the truth.
[01:37:59.068 --> 01:38:02.168]  The videos are on Infowars.com right now.
[01:38:02.248 --> 01:38:05.829]  Members of Migrant Caravan admit they want to enter America for money.
[01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:11.311]  Migrant admits it's economic not to claim asylum from violence or persecution.
[01:38:12.811 --> 01:38:15.232]  An unusual amount of Muslims coming across.
[01:38:16.994 --> 01:38:22.876]  Now, expanding on that, Michael Schneider's here with us, running for the first congressional seat in Idaho.
[01:38:23.116 --> 01:38:33.861]  He's in second place, in a field of seven, in a dead heat with the neocon Never Trumper that George Soros and others have reportedly been funding.
[01:38:33.901 --> 01:38:36.742]  And he's here, a lot of listeners already know, he's in a key race.
[01:38:36.762 --> 01:38:39.923]  We're supposed to talk generalities and a bunch of subjects with him.
[01:38:39.983 --> 01:38:46.326]  But, you know, you see the black fellow from South America or Central America, he's trying to get into the racist country.
[01:38:48.082 --> 01:38:50.183]  And of course, you've got other folks trying to get into the racist countries.
[01:38:50.203 --> 01:38:52.725]  You know, the truth is, we're one of the most open countries in the world.
[01:38:52.825 --> 01:38:59.729]  We're being told, you capitulate to this, and the Democrats are saying, you come in here because the whites are evil, and we're going to teach you how to hate them.
[01:39:00.330 --> 01:39:05.093]  And that's the real evil of this, is the welfare and all of it, because they take these people and domesticate them.
[01:39:05.953 --> 01:39:12.518]  And quite frankly, these migrants already look like, on average, that they are about 100 pounds overweight.
[01:39:13.655 --> 01:39:15.596]  And look, you know, I'm about 20-30 pounds overweight.
[01:39:15.636 --> 01:39:16.737]  I'm not knocking fat people.
[01:39:17.638 --> 01:39:20.219]  I'm just saying that, remember that article?
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.620]  It's on YouTube.
[01:39:22.921 --> 01:39:26.483]  I did a video, maybe Google Alex Jones wears giant pair of underwear over his head.
[01:39:26.844 --> 01:39:28.445]  They were 6X underwear.
[01:39:29.716 --> 01:39:33.621]  Search engine this, it was reported, what was it, 40,000 or 35,000?
[01:39:34.221 --> 01:39:37.105]  40,000 pairs of 6X, or was it 5X underwear?
[01:39:37.145 --> 01:39:38.607]  I think it was 6X underwear ordered.
[01:39:39.608 --> 01:39:44.113]  That was four years ago, during the migrant wave that Obama said they're all children, remember?
[01:39:44.754 --> 01:39:47.016]  And the headline was, 40 plus thousand
[01:39:48.493 --> 01:39:57.541]  Pairs of underwear ordered just, that's what they estimated, just for that number of people that wore underwear that I could wear as a tunic.
[01:39:57.881 --> 01:39:59.703]  And I weigh, you know, yeah, yeah, there we are.
[01:39:59.943 --> 01:40:02.105]  I mean, I mean, I weigh 240 pounds.
[01:40:03.226 --> 01:40:06.488]  Okay, but I could wear that as a full body, you know, like Andre the Giant.
[01:40:06.829 --> 01:40:09.531]  I mean, those underwear would be big on Andre the Giant.
[01:40:09.911 --> 01:40:13.995]  And you can pull it up, folks, I'm not joking, 40 plus thousand pairs.
[01:40:17.225 --> 01:40:17.765]  of course.
[01:40:35.791 --> 01:40:36.732]  We'll be in the video.
[01:40:37.032 --> 01:40:38.354]  We'll actually find the original now.
[01:40:38.694 --> 01:40:39.595]  It's like 34,000.
[01:40:39.815 --> 01:40:40.976]  Let's see my memory, sir.
[01:40:41.036 --> 01:40:41.637]  Was it 34,000 or 44,000?
[01:40:42.898 --> 01:40:48.583]  My memory's saying 34,000 or 44,000 pairs of 6X.
[01:40:48.623 --> 01:40:49.284]  It was 6X.
[01:40:49.804 --> 01:40:50.605]  Specially ordered.
[01:40:50.625 --> 01:40:51.586]  I think it was from Walmart.
[01:40:51.846 --> 01:40:52.487]  I'm going from memory.
[01:40:52.787 --> 01:40:53.668]  Like four or five years ago.
[01:40:54.409 --> 01:40:56.811]  But if people want to go see the video for themselves, we pull it back up.
[01:40:57.051 --> 01:40:57.892]  It's on YouTube for now.
[01:40:57.912 --> 01:40:58.713]  They're trying to delete the channel.
[01:41:00.214 --> 01:41:09.477]  And that is, Texas is being invaded by South American walruses, is the ridiculous headline on that.
[01:41:09.757 --> 01:41:14.479]  We're taking your phone calls on how are they planning to remove Trump, now that the whole Mueller thing is falling apart.
[01:41:15.413 --> 01:41:17.255]  And what do you think they're going to do to strike back?
[01:41:17.655 --> 01:41:23.660]  Joining me here is Michael Snyder of michaelsnyderforcongress.com, better known, of course, for his economic collapse blog.
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:31.766]  He's a best-selling author, lecturer, educator, married to his wonderful wife and their great daughter that they have together.
[01:41:32.467 --> 01:41:37.511]  And he is very close within striking distance of winning against the establishment candidate.
[01:41:38.052 --> 01:41:39.072]  So thank you for joining us.
[01:41:39.873 --> 01:41:41.735]  Oh, thank you, Alex, for having me on the show today.
[01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:46.038]  And yeah, people need to get engaged in primaries all over the nation because now is the time.
[01:41:46.098 --> 01:41:47.540]  We have the globalists on the run.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:49.281]  John McCain, he has two feet in the grave.
[01:41:49.301 --> 01:41:50.922]  Hillary Clinton, she has two feet in the grave.
[01:41:51.223 --> 01:41:51.923]  They're getting old.
[01:41:52.143 --> 01:41:52.684]  They're dying.
[01:41:52.884 --> 01:41:54.165]  A new generation is rising.
[01:41:54.245 --> 01:42:02.812]  I believe this is going to be the moment in American history when bold patriots rise up and restore our constitutional republic and take our country back from the globalists.
[01:42:02.872 --> 01:42:04.614]  We can do it, but we have to get involved.
[01:42:04.654 --> 01:42:05.815]  And it's one seat at a time.
[01:42:06.175 --> 01:42:09.296]  Well, on the local level, but you have to go out and vote.
[01:42:09.336 --> 01:42:13.758]  In fact, right now, when you're done listening to Alex Jones today, you can go out and vote in Idaho today.
[01:42:13.798 --> 01:42:19.480]  You can go vote for Michael Snyder for Congress in District 1 and even in District 2 where nobody's running against the Rhino there.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.401]  People are writing my name in.
[01:42:21.441 --> 01:42:26.463]  We're getting reports that people are literally writing my name in because no one actually ran against the Rhino in District 2.
[01:42:26.923 --> 01:42:29.424]  But I'm in District 1, Idaho's first congressional district.
[01:42:29.464 --> 01:42:31.004]  We're very close, Alex, very close.
[01:42:31.324 --> 01:42:32.085]  Election Day is May 15th.
[01:42:34.753 --> 01:42:35.373]  I'm excited.
[01:42:35.673 --> 01:42:39.775]  Christine, Alex, many others, your calls are coming up on the other side.
[01:42:39.855 --> 01:42:42.997]  Michael Steiner riding shotgun with us to the bottom of the next hour.
[01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:49.520]  And then, we've got Vox Day of Voxversity joining us.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:56.463]  Vox Day is going to be joining us to talk about the neoconglobalist infiltration of the Liberty Movement.
[01:42:56.523 --> 01:42:58.643]  Critical Intel, straight ahead.
[01:42:58.764 --> 01:42:59.384]  Please stay with us.
[01:43:02.788 --> 01:43:03.368]  Alpha Power.
[01:43:03.748 --> 01:43:04.548]  Here's what you want to know.
[01:43:04.768 --> 01:43:10.750]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[01:43:11.410 --> 01:43:14.950]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[01:43:15.831 --> 01:43:23.792]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[01:43:24.332 --> 01:43:27.693]  The average male or female enhancement
[01:43:28.673 --> 01:43:31.656]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[01:43:31.937 --> 01:43:33.658]  It just has a little bit in it.
[01:43:33.999 --> 01:43:39.124]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[01:43:39.384 --> 01:43:47.012]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product.
[01:43:47.352 --> 01:43:48.373]  We're good to go.
[01:44:03.393 --> 01:44:04.134]  I'm so excited.
[01:44:04.194 --> 01:44:13.760]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:19.524]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:19.844 --> 01:44:22.646]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:22.866 --> 01:44:31.612]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:33.733 --> 01:44:38.537]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:44:39.038 --> 01:44:41.820]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:52.850]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:54.631]  It is amazing!
[01:44:56.033 --> 01:45:00.997]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:45:51.929 --> 01:45:56.671]  You've always thought you couldn't bare press on nails because of all the active things you do?
[01:45:57.291 --> 01:45:59.372]  Re-colored in seven luscious hues.
[01:46:00.072 --> 01:46:05.434]  Just... Our impulses are being redirected.
[01:46:06.054 --> 01:46:11.336]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[01:46:11.756 --> 01:46:13.617]  These signals being sent through time.
[01:46:16.201 --> 01:46:18.182]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:46:18.743 --> 01:46:21.885]  Our signal has reached more than 2 billion people.
[01:46:22.786 --> 01:46:27.969]  But the enemy is now aware of the fact that we've broken through and are moving to block us on every front.
[01:46:28.610 --> 01:46:37.436]  The only way you're going to be able to see our videos and articles is to visit InfoWars.com itself and hand-share the videos and articles to everyone you know.
[01:46:38.016 --> 01:46:43.300]  The signal is getting through and is exposing and defeating the globalists when we're able to get it through.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:49.202]  But they're admittedly expanding their operations to suppress us, so only you can boost the signal.
[01:46:49.802 --> 01:46:51.723]  Only you can defeat the Globalist.
[01:46:52.103 --> 01:46:52.983]  We're in this together.
[01:46:53.483 --> 01:46:57.105]  I salute you for your work, and I ask all of you to redouble your efforts.
[01:46:57.165 --> 01:47:02.266]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are resistance.
[01:47:06.168 --> 01:47:08.969]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.508 --> 01:47:35.036]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:35.617 --> 01:47:37.701]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:37.721 --> 01:47:38.403]  I was telling...
[01:47:39.946 --> 01:47:41.987]  Michael Snyder during the break, he thinks he's going to win.
[01:47:42.067 --> 01:47:45.309]  He's within striking distance in a seven-way race, close to number two.
[01:47:45.929 --> 01:47:47.050]  People get out, he'll win.
[01:47:47.110 --> 01:47:54.413]  But even if he loses, he's won by going to the debates, educating people in Idaho, using, by running, getting in the system.
[01:47:54.453 --> 01:47:55.974]  And if he runs again the next time, he'll win.
[01:47:56.494 --> 01:47:57.355]  That's how this works.
[01:47:57.415 --> 01:47:59.476]  Ron Paul had to run a couple times before he won again.
[01:47:59.816 --> 01:48:03.858]  He got into Congress the first time in the whole Reagan wave, and then got kicked out, then came back.
[01:48:05.387 --> 01:48:08.230]  You only lose by not trying, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:08.710 --> 01:48:10.112]  But, we found it.
[01:48:10.632 --> 01:48:13.235]  We put the news article up, please, and we'll go to your calls with Michael Schneider.
[01:48:13.836 --> 01:48:14.336]  We found it.
[01:48:15.457 --> 01:48:21.944]  Homeland Security seeks thousands of pairs, it was 42,000, of underwear for detainee immigrants.
[01:48:23.331 --> 01:48:27.134]  Uh, and it was, uh, it was amazing.
[01:48:28.235 --> 01:48:29.496]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:48:30.416 --> 01:48:33.338]  Six X large pairs of underwear.
[01:48:34.059 --> 01:48:35.380]  I guess that's a different article she found.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:35.900]  I remember it was the 44,000.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:42.585]  Uh, we actually found the video from now four years ago.
[01:48:42.645 --> 01:48:43.426]  So here it is.
[01:48:44.546 --> 01:48:46.308]  Went over to the big and tall store.
[01:48:46.488 --> 01:48:49.130]  Walmart didn't even have six X. Target didn't have it.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:57.542]  42,000 pairs of 6X for the illegal aliens from south of Mexico that bus up on a train every day.
[01:48:57.562 --> 01:49:01.904]  To understand, folks, you could wear this, I could wear this as a onesie, okay?
[01:49:01.924 --> 01:49:04.844]  I could wear this as a leotard.
[01:49:05.585 --> 01:49:11.446]  I mean... I mean... Oh, my God.
[01:49:12.447 --> 01:49:13.307]  Oh, my God.
[01:49:13.347 --> 01:49:16.348]  We're being invaded by South American walruses.
[01:49:19.549 --> 01:49:23.372]  The government is shipping in 42,000 people.
[01:49:23.392 --> 01:49:26.735]  That's bigger than Jabba the Hutt.
[01:49:28.636 --> 01:49:30.678]  This country is so screwed up, man.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.223]  I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh, but it's reaching a proportion.
[01:49:37.523 --> 01:49:39.985]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see him.
[01:49:40.506 --> 01:49:46.570]  Oh my God, look at this.
[01:49:46.670 --> 01:49:47.271]  Actually, my underwear.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:52.985]  I don't think I've ever laughed this hard on air.
[01:49:53.005 --> 01:50:01.435]  Oh my god, it's so ridiculous.
[01:50:02.657 --> 01:50:03.938]  Oh my god, excuse me.
[01:50:04.619 --> 01:50:05.540]  What do you make of that?
[01:50:06.745 --> 01:50:08.205]  I don't even know where to begin.
[01:50:08.225 --> 01:50:15.987]  I mean, obviously we tuned in before I came on the air to just make sure it had some continuity, but I was stunned.
[01:50:16.087 --> 01:50:17.387]  I've never heard of any such thing.
[01:50:18.087 --> 01:50:19.968]  Almost nothing surprises me anymore, though.
[01:50:19.988 --> 01:50:24.908]  I mean, this is an... I love Obama!
[01:50:32.610 --> 01:50:33.090]  There you go!
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:36.401]  There you go, Alex.
[01:50:36.581 --> 01:50:38.682]  Well, you wear underwear on your head if you win Congress.
[01:50:38.962 --> 01:50:40.123]  That's part of the new club.
[01:50:40.143 --> 01:50:41.804]  That'll get you a headline.
[01:50:41.844 --> 01:50:42.584]  It'll push you over the edge.
[01:50:42.744 --> 01:50:45.506]  Promise to wear giant underwear on your head if you win.
[01:50:46.247 --> 01:50:46.767]  There you go.
[01:50:46.787 --> 01:50:47.427]  There you go.
[01:50:47.447 --> 01:50:48.308]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:49.569]  We have Michael Schneider here with us.
[01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:50.789]  Taking your phone calls next hour.
[01:50:51.210 --> 01:50:51.910]  Covering the waterfront.
[01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:52.771]  Getting serious now.
[01:50:54.312 --> 01:50:55.893]  That is a lot of 6X underwear.
[01:51:11.283 --> 01:51:12.144]  Super complicated.
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:27.820]  Islamic terrorists, you want to come in too?
[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:29.041]  Come to our sanctuary cities.
[01:51:29.401 --> 01:51:31.542]  Finally, we have a president that's cracking down on it.
[01:51:31.582 --> 01:51:34.643]  That's why when Donald Trump came on the scene, he said, I want to build a wall.
[01:51:34.683 --> 01:51:35.523]  I said, that's my guy.
[01:51:35.823 --> 01:51:42.945]  So I was with Donald Trump from the beginning, just like InfoWars was, because finally a president was serious about securing our borders.
[01:51:42.965 --> 01:51:46.026]  Because either, like Donald Trump says, either we have a country or we don't.
[01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:52.991]  We're going to go to some phone calls here in a moment, but I want to get back into Mueller.
[01:51:53.971 --> 01:51:59.173]  What do you make now of three federal judges coming out, just sensational, and saying, you're lying.
[01:51:59.213 --> 01:52:00.074]  You lied to get warrants.
[01:52:00.094 --> 01:52:01.014]  You lied to Congress.
[01:52:01.094 --> 01:52:02.174]  I've seen the secret documents.
[01:52:02.194 --> 01:52:03.275]  You're lying about what's in those.
[01:52:03.675 --> 01:52:05.015]  You just want to impeach the president.
[01:52:05.075 --> 01:52:05.716]  You're a fraud.
[01:52:05.796 --> 01:52:06.876]  No stays on these.
[01:52:07.296 --> 01:52:09.457]  I mean, this is, Mueller is just reeling from this.
[01:52:10.117 --> 01:52:15.382]  Yeah, and it's extraordinary because the people we have in our federal judiciary aren't exactly the sharpest tools in the shed.
[01:52:15.422 --> 01:52:17.004]  Most of them are leftist.
[01:52:17.344 --> 01:52:23.610]  And so for three of them to come out and say the obvious, what we've known from the beginning, what I've been saying from the beginning, is this has been a total witch hunt.
[01:52:24.051 --> 01:52:24.931]  Total witch hunt.
[01:52:25.212 --> 01:52:27.214]  And they found nothing in over a year.
[01:52:27.234 --> 01:52:33.420]  And, you know, at the debate other night in Idaho, our final congressional debate, I said, hey, we got to shut this down.
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:34.941]  I know nothing!
[01:52:35.001 --> 01:52:35.561]  I know nothing!
[01:52:56.152 --> 01:53:20.542]  Yeah, and in the back they've even found the video clip of that, from that debate, where this guy's up there three times, not just one time, he says it three times, he says, you know, I haven't been following that, I can't really answer your question, I can't give you my opinion, never did answer the reporter's question, who had just asked him a question about the Mueller investigation, never gave an answer one way or the other, all he could say was, you know, I haven't been following that, even though it's the biggest news story, the biggest controversy.
[01:53:20.562 --> 01:53:23.584]  Well obviously when they say that, it's because they don't want to talk bad about Lord Mueller.
[01:53:24.184 --> 01:53:25.848]  So what do you expect the Democrats to do next?
[01:53:25.968 --> 01:53:28.133]  I think they're going to stage a false flag or pull something big.
[01:53:28.769 --> 01:53:29.450]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:32.372]  And what the Democrats ultimately want is they want to get rid of Trump.
[01:53:32.392 --> 01:53:34.993]  Because the Democratic Party, totally controlled by the globalists.
[01:53:35.374 --> 01:53:37.295]  Republicans, mostly controlled by the globalists.
[01:53:37.355 --> 01:53:38.416]  Although we're taking ground.
[01:53:38.456 --> 01:53:39.196]  We're taking it back.
[01:53:39.476 --> 01:53:40.817]  That's why I'm running for Congress.
[01:53:40.837 --> 01:53:42.939]  Because we're trying to take over the Republican Party.
[01:53:43.219 --> 01:53:49.923]  Yeah, we've just got a foothold now, a beachhead, despite the RINOs, the neocons, and the globalists, and the leftists.
[01:53:50.764 --> 01:53:54.206]  The biggest now group in that fractured system is the patriots.
[01:53:54.246 --> 01:53:54.826]  We're rising.
[01:53:55.127 --> 01:53:56.588]  They're trying to destroy all of our leaders.
[01:53:56.968 --> 01:53:58.569]  They're putting neocons into our movement.
[01:53:59.249 --> 01:54:01.211]  Yeah, and Trump has established his beachhead.
[01:54:01.371 --> 01:54:02.552]  You know, my father was in the Navy.
[01:54:02.592 --> 01:54:04.353]  I like to talk in military terms.
[01:54:04.634 --> 01:54:05.694]  So he stormed the beach.
[01:54:05.735 --> 01:54:06.915]  He's under constant fire.
[01:54:07.196 --> 01:54:08.417]  He needs backup.
[01:54:08.537 --> 01:54:13.961]  That's why in Idaho, our biggest thing is, whatever we do, on our campaign signs, right at the top, it says, Vote Pro Trump.
[01:54:14.301 --> 01:54:17.984]  If you look at our campaign literature, it says vote for the pro-Trump candidate right on the front.
[01:54:18.304 --> 01:54:34.014]  If you go to our website, michelsnyderforcongress.com, you're greeted by a pro-Trump message, because we want everyone to know we're the pro-Trump candidate, we're the anti-globalist candidate, we're the hardcore InfoWars platform, Ron Paul platform, freedom, liberty, restoring limited government, restoring our constitutional republic.
[01:54:34.314 --> 01:54:35.315]  That's what we're all about.
[01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:36.036]  But you know what?
[01:54:36.296 --> 01:54:40.178]  My opponents have noticed that our message is working, and so they've started to copy us.
[01:54:44.241 --> 01:54:51.083]  They're acting like they're pro-Trump or pro-Make America Great, but some Republicans are actually running against Trump.
[01:54:52.023 --> 01:54:52.803]  They have no instincts.
[01:54:52.843 --> 01:54:56.524]  The Democrats are acting like they're pro-Trump, but Republicans, some of them, don't get that.
[01:54:57.045 --> 01:55:03.266]  Oh, a lot of the Republicans are totally clueless, and you know, it's like when they go to D.C., it's like they have their signs surgically removed.
[01:55:03.326 --> 01:55:05.067]  They're constantly compromising on anything.
[01:55:05.407 --> 01:55:08.348]  They've been compromising for so long, they don't believe in anything anymore.
[01:55:08.548 --> 01:55:12.789]  That's why we need to send people to Washington that aren't just right on the issues, but that are willing to fight.
[01:55:13.209 --> 01:55:19.097]  And if I go to Congress, I mean, we very well understand, I'm going to be the most hated member of Congress in all of Washington, D.C.
[01:55:19.217 --> 01:55:25.846]  Oh, it'd be beautiful if you were there, because it's just educating folks in Idaho by running, and you are in a close second place in the seven-way race.
[01:55:26.307 --> 01:55:28.009]  But if you get there, imagine you up there.
[01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:36.154]  On C-SPAN, on national TV, everywhere, going through the New World Order, going through the TPP, going through the Department of Education, it would really be a good thing.
[01:55:36.715 --> 01:55:42.078]  Oh, and I'll go right to the floor of the House of Representatives, and I'll start ranting like Alex Jones.
[01:55:42.098 --> 01:55:44.699]  You guys know me right from the floor of the House of Representatives.
[01:55:45.019 --> 01:55:48.982]  So if you want to see that, we have this opportunity to defeat the globalists one seat at a time.
[01:55:49.002 --> 01:55:50.843]  Oh, we're not saying, don't be like the Democrats.
[01:55:51.303 --> 01:55:56.928]  And if your mom, your dad, your cousin, your brother, whatever, died the last few years on the voter roll, do not go in and vote in their name.
[01:55:57.088 --> 01:55:58.429]  And I'm not being tongue-in-cheek.
[01:55:58.469 --> 01:55:59.751]  We really shouldn't become the enemy.
[01:56:00.131 --> 01:56:02.994]  But go catch illegals or folks voting in the name of dead people.
[01:56:03.034 --> 01:56:05.676]  Just make sure you get out and you vote.
[01:56:05.716 --> 01:56:07.558]  Because you know they're going to pull some hanky-panky.
[01:56:08.178 --> 01:56:09.320]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:13.766]  But the beautiful thing is, the primaries, we can have so much more of an impact than the general election.
[01:56:13.786 --> 01:56:15.568]  Because in our primaries... But that is an issue.
[01:56:15.608 --> 01:56:18.532]  The Democrats are giving driver's licenses all over the country, illegals to vote.
[01:56:18.892 --> 01:56:21.616]  They're doing all this, and then we as libertarians or Christians, we don't cheat.
[01:56:22.196 --> 01:56:23.358]  Okay, I agree, we shouldn't cheat.
[01:56:23.759 --> 01:56:26.222]  But we need to start prosecuting these people that are caught cheating.
[01:56:26.542 --> 01:56:28.703]  Yeah, we need to restore the rule of law in this country.
[01:56:28.743 --> 01:56:30.543]  That's why I'm the only one... I'll be honest, though.
[01:56:31.183 --> 01:56:35.745]  I've really thought about... Because if conservatives started cheating, we'd be much better than Democrats at it.
[01:56:36.345 --> 01:56:41.827]  And I just... I mean, at a certain level, man, I think about cheating because they're cheating, and I'm not gonna cheat.
[01:56:42.207 --> 01:56:45.128]  I'm being honest here, but I think about it, which is why I'm a sinful person.
[01:56:45.908 --> 01:56:49.432]  Oh yeah, I mean, even the globalist Republicans cheat.
[01:56:49.552 --> 01:56:53.837]  You know, they're smearing me all over Facebook, all over the media in Idaho, telling me lies.
[01:56:53.857 --> 01:56:57.501]  Oh yeah, the new thing is, it's not just that conservatives are being censored by YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.
[01:56:57.982 --> 01:57:03.348]  They've got all these conservative, light, pro-war neocons who they just flood.
[01:57:03.548 --> 01:57:04.429]  They don't block them.
[01:57:04.449 --> 01:57:05.531]  And there's a list of them.
[01:57:05.911 --> 01:57:08.113]  And it's people like Shapiro and others, and it's disgusting.
[01:57:08.533 --> 01:57:09.194]  Oh, it really is.
[01:57:09.314 --> 01:57:09.735]  It really is.
[01:57:09.875 --> 01:57:24.148]  And, you know, for example, they could have attacked me on so many things that are true, but they're actually saying on Facebook that I'm a plant from Washington D.C., I was sent to Idaho to sit there all these years, then spring up at just the right time and try to destroy the conservative movement in Idaho.
[01:57:24.748 --> 01:57:26.189]  As a plant from Washington, D.C.
[01:57:26.409 --> 01:57:33.733]  Even though I'm on InfoWars, written more than 3,000 articles, fighting the New World Order, fighting the globalists, they say I'm a plant from Washington, D.C.
[01:57:33.893 --> 01:57:39.597]  That's the theory going around Facebook, because they're trying to destroy me, because they're desperate not to... Well, everybody sees through that, Michael.
[01:57:40.297 --> 01:57:42.638]  Anyways, we'll be right back with your phone calls, I promise.
[01:57:42.678 --> 01:57:47.001]  I'm going right to Christine and others, but we come back from this break in only two minutes.
[01:57:47.101 --> 01:57:49.362]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:57:49.382 --> 01:57:50.223]  Please spread those links.
[01:57:52.057 --> 01:58:00.902]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:58:02.122 --> 01:58:03.923]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:58:03.983 --> 01:58:11.107]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:58:11.507 --> 01:58:17.290]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:19.291]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[01:58:19.912 --> 01:58:38.969]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:44.177]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:58:44.497 --> 01:58:47.041]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult.
[01:58:47.101 --> 01:58:49.765]  A lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[01:58:50.185 --> 01:58:51.227]  As above, so below.
[01:58:51.808 --> 01:58:54.632]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[01:58:55.493 --> 01:58:56.574]  Most tiny of scales.
[01:58:57.114 --> 01:58:58.195]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:58:58.616 --> 01:59:00.097]  America is building its wall.
[01:59:00.497 --> 01:59:00.978]  Will it work?
[01:59:01.098 --> 01:59:01.598]  We don't know.
[01:59:02.098 --> 01:59:02.679]  Is Trump right?
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:05.521]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:59:06.002 --> 01:59:11.967]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[01:59:12.347 --> 01:59:18.232]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:59:18.972 --> 01:59:25.279]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:29.283]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[01:59:29.724 --> 01:59:41.035]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:59:41.676 --> 01:59:44.058]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[01:59:44.698 --> 01:59:47.941]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at m4slife.com.
[01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:52.024]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:59:56.087 --> 01:59:59.749]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:11.221 --> 02:00:22.144]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:00:26.345 --> 02:00:28.966]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:36.661 --> 02:00:41.064]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide, running for Congress in the First District of Idaho.
[02:00:41.164 --> 02:00:49.708]  The syndicated columnist and author and educator is with us right now, and we are taking your phone calls again with Michael Snyder.
[02:00:49.728 --> 02:00:52.490]  Let's go to Christine in Colorado.
[02:00:52.530 --> 02:00:53.230]  You're on the air.
[02:00:53.370 --> 02:00:54.031]  Thank you for holding.
[02:00:55.332 --> 02:00:56.232]  Oh, no problem, Alex.
[02:00:56.332 --> 02:00:59.214]  Thank you so much for your show all these years.
[02:00:59.234 --> 02:01:01.715]  I wanted to ask you a question, though.
[02:01:01.735 --> 02:01:04.137]  There's a show on SNAPU Radio.
[02:01:05.461 --> 02:01:11.362]  By Scott, it's the Alex Jones Compromise by Cody Snodgrass.
[02:01:11.382 --> 02:01:17.583]  He sent you a book, Choosing the Light, and I was wondering why he hasn't heard anything from you yet.
[02:01:18.083 --> 02:01:19.584]  I think you're doing an awesome job.
[02:01:19.764 --> 02:01:20.464]  Well, thank you, ma'am.
[02:01:20.484 --> 02:01:23.284]  Maybe I should turn my audio down, but you're distorted a little bit.
[02:01:24.925 --> 02:01:26.705]  Someone sent me a, did you say a book?
[02:01:27.865 --> 02:01:29.606]  Yes, it was Cody Snodgrass.
[02:01:29.666 --> 02:01:31.566]  He sent you a book called Choosing the Light.
[02:01:32.315 --> 02:01:35.175]  Okay, well listen, I get hundreds of things a week.
[02:01:35.296 --> 02:01:36.516]  A lot of it ends up on air.
[02:01:37.696 --> 02:01:43.857]  I may have missed that book, but if I don't email somebody back or I don't call them back about their book, it's not a personal thing.
[02:01:44.317 --> 02:01:50.758]  I get totally overwhelmed up here, then I kind of run out of steam about five or six o'clock, but I will try to look into that.
[02:01:50.798 --> 02:01:51.158]  Thank you.
[02:01:51.718 --> 02:01:53.359]  You called about not happy with Trump?
[02:01:54.819 --> 02:01:57.159]  Well, it's not that I'm not happy with Trump.
[02:01:57.239 --> 02:02:01.100]  I think that he's doing a very good job overall with getting everything in.
[02:02:02.153 --> 02:02:07.038]  Don't know how they're going to... I have like a mixed view about Trump, actually.
[02:02:07.599 --> 02:02:08.220]  I do too.
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:14.006]  I don't know if he's the last Illuminati Trump card to be played, no pun intended, or if he's the
[02:02:14.522 --> 02:02:15.983]  Well, I can tell you this, ma'am.
[02:02:16.003 --> 02:02:20.605]  Trump has irrevocably damaged globalist political correctness, the TPP.
[02:02:33.170 --> 02:02:35.171]  The WTO, their whole system.
[02:02:35.211 --> 02:02:36.232]  He's bringing power back.
[02:02:36.572 --> 02:02:37.733]  He's bringing sovereignty back.
[02:02:38.073 --> 02:02:40.234]  Doesn't mean he has all the answers or is perfect.
[02:02:40.274 --> 02:02:43.595]  He's exposing communist China's control of Hollywood and our media.
[02:02:44.076 --> 02:02:45.436]  That is the big issue.
[02:02:45.476 --> 02:02:48.998]  That's the heart is the sellout to China because they've allied with the globalists.
[02:02:49.018 --> 02:02:51.920]  So Trump is for real bringing America back.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:53.561]  Trump believes in what he's doing.
[02:02:53.581 --> 02:02:54.501]  Does it mean he's perfect?
[02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:56.502]  Does it mean that they can't get to him?
[02:02:56.522 --> 02:02:57.483]  No, absolutely not.
[02:02:57.563 --> 02:02:59.604]  But I can tell you at a gut level,
[02:03:00.563 --> 02:03:02.746]  At an intellectual level, Trump's the real deal.
[02:03:02.786 --> 02:03:04.809]  That's why you see them completely freaking out.
[02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:06.351]  That's why you see all this craziness.
[02:03:06.371 --> 02:03:08.094]  This is not business as usual.
[02:03:08.134 --> 02:03:11.678]  This isn't Carol Quigley talking about controlling both parties.
[02:03:12.895 --> 02:03:17.978]  There's populism exploding worldwide because we exposed it and many others exposed the paradigm.
[02:03:17.998 --> 02:03:18.459]  Michael Snyder?
[02:03:19.019 --> 02:03:24.342]  Yeah, the reason the Democrats, the Republicans, all the establishment hate Trump is because he is the real deal.
[02:03:24.462 --> 02:03:28.345]  Now, Trump does have a lot of bad people around him that are giving him really bad advice.
[02:03:28.385 --> 02:03:29.065]  He's independent.
[02:03:29.345 --> 02:03:30.386]  He's the real deal.
[02:03:30.446 --> 02:03:31.247]  He's not with them.
[02:03:31.587 --> 02:03:33.028]  Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[02:03:33.108 --> 02:03:34.048]  People don't get what we're saying.
[02:03:34.249 --> 02:03:34.449]  Yeah.
[02:03:34.569 --> 02:03:36.270]  It's like, no, he's the real deal, folks.
[02:03:36.690 --> 02:03:39.132]  So he has a lot of people around him giving him bad information.
[02:03:39.152 --> 02:03:40.753]  For example, we saw that in Syria.
[02:03:40.793 --> 02:03:42.254]  We've seen that in some other situations.
[02:03:42.735 --> 02:03:46.458]  So we need to get people to Washington that are pro-Trump, that are going to give him good advice.
[02:03:47.499 --> 02:03:52.923]  And that's one of the reasons we want to go to Washington, to be on his side and tell him, hey, Mr. President, this is what we need to do.
[02:03:53.303 --> 02:03:58.188]  So we believe in Trump, yeah, and no one's perfect, but Donald Trump has done so many good things.
[02:03:58.228 --> 02:03:59.849]  He's surrounded by a lot of bad people.
[02:04:00.110 --> 02:04:06.916]  And he's trying to find good people, and anybody that's done IT, engineering, childcare, it's hard to get good people nowadays.
[02:04:07.097 --> 02:04:10.420]  It is, and that's why he's constantly firing people, because he's trying to sort through people.
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:12.362]  Yeah, they act like, oh look, he's a loser.
[02:04:12.442 --> 02:04:14.504]  No, that's what you do is you go through people.
[02:04:14.884 --> 02:04:15.544]  Yeah.
[02:04:15.664 --> 02:04:20.386]  When I finally found out about firing people quickly, the wheels started turning around here.
[02:04:20.667 --> 02:04:21.867]  We've got a great crew now.
[02:04:22.347 --> 02:04:23.488]  And they don't put up with crap.
[02:04:24.148 --> 02:04:28.610]  You get bad cultures, it's all a bunch of bad people making excuses, stirring up trouble.
[02:04:28.630 --> 02:04:30.891]  You get a good crew, boom, you take off.
[02:04:31.451 --> 02:04:35.533]  Yeah, so the second half of Trump's presidency should be much better once he gets a good crew in there.
[02:04:35.753 --> 02:04:36.874]  And notice he is getting better.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:38.840]  Absolutely.
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:41.161]  And we need to get him a better Congress now.
[02:04:41.382 --> 02:04:44.903]  That's why you can get a pro-Trump person in Congress in Idaho's 1st Congressional District.
[02:04:44.943 --> 02:04:45.724]  Go vote today.
[02:04:45.964 --> 02:04:46.864]  Early voting is open.
[02:04:47.224 --> 02:04:50.046]  Or we can get a neocon surrounded by people that hates Trump.
[02:04:50.306 --> 02:04:51.106]  And that's my opponent.
[02:04:51.687 --> 02:04:53.648]  Believe me, brother, I think we've saturated our audience.
[02:04:53.688 --> 02:04:55.128]  I think they're voting for you.
[02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:57.450]  We'll be right back with more phone calls.
[02:04:57.590 --> 02:04:57.990]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:59.070]  Michael Snyder in studio.

[02:06:04.626 --> 02:06:11.093]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:11.153 --> 02:06:13.256]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:15.539 --> 02:06:21.205]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:29.427 --> 02:06:36.814]  Michael Schneider, good friend of mine, city camp columnist, educator, father.
[02:06:37.235 --> 02:06:47.024]  He's running for Congress in Idaho, and we're talking about a key paradigm about the general election, the midterms, about waking people up here in a moment that is the keys to victory and your phone calls.
[02:06:47.125 --> 02:06:49.387]  But first, let's stop right there.
[02:06:51.013 --> 02:06:52.774]  Occam cam shot please for TV viewers.
[02:06:53.255 --> 02:06:58.018]  White House counters China's Orwellian disinformation aimed at Americans.
[02:06:59.099 --> 02:07:03.882]  And finally, they had a press conference with Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[02:07:06.063 --> 02:07:13.909]  And they said that 36 US firms have been told that if they're going to do business in China, they've got to not recognize Taiwan.
[02:07:15.999 --> 02:07:24.388]  And say they don't make declarations and change their maps and have their pilots call it South China Island.
[02:07:26.090 --> 02:07:28.993]  And it's a bunch of other stuff, but this is the tip of the iceberg.
[02:07:29.554 --> 02:07:30.015]  All six
[02:07:31.917 --> 02:07:36.441]  Major Hollywood firms have a controlling interest by the Chinese government.
[02:07:36.741 --> 02:07:41.104]  Three months ago, Reuters reported Apple officially took China's deal of zero tax.
[02:07:41.725 --> 02:07:43.246]  They were at 15, we were at 40.
[02:07:43.967 --> 02:07:45.288]  Trump lowered to 15, to be fair.
[02:07:45.408 --> 02:07:46.789]  China said, zero, baby.
[02:07:47.529 --> 02:07:51.032]  But, you can go there as a corporate head, pay no taxes, live like a king.
[02:07:53.194 --> 02:07:56.617]  Have, you know, factories with suicide nets, forced abortion, like Apple does.
[02:07:56.677 --> 02:07:58.018]  As long as you're liberal, though, it's okay.
[02:07:58.038 --> 02:07:59.139]  As long as you fund Black Lives Matter.
[02:07:59.807 --> 02:08:06.012]  It's okay if you find out any of the employees are Christian, they get shipped off to an organ harvesting center.
[02:08:06.032 --> 02:08:06.973]  I mean, that's liberal.
[02:08:07.013 --> 02:08:07.754]  That's trendy.
[02:08:07.774 --> 02:08:08.494]  Thank God they're doing it.
[02:08:08.935 --> 02:08:10.636]  Kill those Buddhists as well, as quickly as possible.
[02:08:11.377 --> 02:08:12.798]  But again, Apple is liberal.
[02:08:13.379 --> 02:08:14.880]  Mr. Cook's liberal, so everything's okay.
[02:08:16.141 --> 02:08:23.848]  But Trump comes out and they point out that the University of Texas and other big universities
[02:08:25.015 --> 02:08:31.480]  Main international chairs, and they're science chairs, that means whoever chairs the department, are controlled by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:34.282]  That's now Associated Press, Reuters, you name it.
[02:08:35.803 --> 02:08:37.384]  So this is the big infiltration.
[02:08:38.125 --> 02:08:44.850]  And if Trump really wants to get the nitty gritty, there are studies out there on the Democrats, about 10 to 1 get Chinese money.
[02:08:45.523 --> 02:08:47.343]  The Democrats sell out to any foreign power there is.
[02:08:47.363 --> 02:08:49.624]  That's why they're American haters, first and foremost.
[02:08:49.644 --> 02:08:53.125]  Because you've got to kind of already hate the country to be willing to, you know, sell it out.
[02:08:53.665 --> 02:08:54.825]  Not just kind of go along with it.
[02:08:54.845 --> 02:08:56.365]  You've got to really be into it.
[02:08:56.705 --> 02:08:57.345]  That's the cult.
[02:08:59.066 --> 02:09:01.686]  And so now she's come out and said, stop telling U.S.
[02:09:01.746 --> 02:09:04.947]  firms what they've got to say and what they've got to do to do business in your country.
[02:09:05.007 --> 02:09:09.608]  Well, again, we have to go to a 0% corporate tax to counter this.
[02:09:09.648 --> 02:09:10.588]  And a lot of countries have it.
[02:09:11.479 --> 02:09:21.648]  The individuals still pay some, but Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter and all these groups do what they call the double Irish and the this and that.
[02:09:21.688 --> 02:09:29.715]  There's a bunch of different names for it, where you have your corporation here and you move it, the money over there, and they pay zero tax while they lobby you everywhere.
[02:09:30.816 --> 02:09:36.721]  You'll be watching, you know, this week on ABC and at the end of the, it'll say, funded by Berkshire Hathaway and a grant by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.
[02:09:37.711 --> 02:09:41.313]  They will pay for a whole show about how rich people don't pay taxes.
[02:09:41.353 --> 02:09:45.055]  We need, we need to get, you know, Barack Obama re-elected.
[02:09:45.095 --> 02:09:47.636]  Stuff like that, going back, you know, six years ago.
[02:09:48.236 --> 02:09:52.818]  And then you watch the end and it's underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that's tax-exempt.
[02:09:54.259 --> 02:09:59.721]  So this is their whole agenda, folks, and China are the ones that have taken the country over.
[02:10:01.542 --> 02:10:01.802]  We're good.
[02:10:24.195 --> 02:10:28.357]  But then, absolutely, you can just dominate the Chi-Coms.
[02:10:29.198 --> 02:10:30.338]  Michael Snyder, you want to comment on that?
[02:10:30.999 --> 02:10:31.679]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:31.959 --> 02:10:35.121]  China has been taking advantage of us for decades.
[02:10:35.221 --> 02:10:44.506]  For example, today, a Jeep that's made in the United States costs $27,000 here, will cost more than $80,000 in China, because of all the stuff they slap on it.
[02:10:44.566 --> 02:10:51.910]  Meanwhile, we've been letting them flood our shores with all their cheap goods, saying, oh, just come on in, Chinese, sell all your garbage here, and we won't put anything on it.
[02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:55.071]  And so as a result, we have a massive trade deficit with China.
[02:10:55.131 --> 02:10:57.811]  Our cars have a 25% tariff to go into Europe!
[02:10:58.311 --> 02:10:58.512]  I know!
[02:10:58.572 --> 02:11:00.072]  And they bitch if Trump talks about a 5%!
[02:11:00.232 --> 02:11:01.352]  I know!
[02:11:01.872 --> 02:11:03.573]  But we've been taking advantage of.
[02:11:03.693 --> 02:11:04.953]  We've been the suckers.
[02:11:05.013 --> 02:11:11.935]  And that's why since China joined the WTO in 2001, we've lost 70,000 manufacturing facilities, millions of good-paying jobs.
[02:11:12.115 --> 02:11:12.615]  Let's be clear.
[02:11:12.655 --> 02:11:17.436]  We went from a $200 billion a year deficit to a $500 billion, not counting intellectuals, since then.
[02:11:17.884 --> 02:11:22.688]  Yeah, and trying to talk about intellectual property, stealing our intellectual property non-stop.
[02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:23.548]  Nothing's ever done.
[02:11:23.608 --> 02:11:29.993]  Finally, we have a president that's standing up to China and saying, OK, if you're going to take advantage of us, we're going to slap tariffs on you.
[02:11:30.273 --> 02:11:32.355]  And then the mainstream media says, oh, the world's about to end.
[02:11:32.395 --> 02:11:33.456]  We're standing up to China.
[02:11:33.516 --> 02:11:34.316]  We can't do that.
[02:11:34.557 --> 02:11:37.679]  Of course, China's buying up our farmland, our movie theaters, our real estate.
[02:11:37.899 --> 02:11:40.021]  They're literally buying up the whole country.
[02:11:40.341 --> 02:11:44.584]  And so something has got to be done, because while we've been playing checkers, China's been playing chess.
[02:11:44.864 --> 02:11:46.886]  We have President Trump was the only one
[02:11:46.886 --> 02:11:49.967]  That's because the globalist plan was to sell America out.
[02:11:50.027 --> 02:11:51.568]  We were sold out by the globalists.
[02:11:51.748 --> 02:11:52.008]  Yeah.
[02:11:52.249 --> 02:11:52.949]  This is a deal.
[02:11:53.169 --> 02:12:00.352]  That's why Obama, after he let Trump, Trump left China and Singapore and everything, Obama's right behind him meeting saying don't go along with him.
[02:12:00.693 --> 02:12:01.233]  Yeah.
[02:12:01.253 --> 02:12:03.394]  We've got a shadow government in place we're holding on.
[02:12:03.914 --> 02:12:09.897]  You go over to China today, all along the coast there, especially, they got shiny new cities filled with gleaming new factories.
[02:12:10.197 --> 02:12:17.860]  Meanwhile, Detroit, which once was the greatest manufacturing city in the history of mankind, is a rotting war zone today.
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:21.701]  You know, we've been, the Chinese never would have been anything without us.
[02:12:21.722 --> 02:12:23.482]  This was always the plan to bring us down.
[02:12:23.542 --> 02:12:24.663]  This is the global plan.
[02:12:25.043 --> 02:12:30.905]  The CFR, all of them, Hollywood, the Chinese century, this is the plan.
[02:12:31.065 --> 02:12:32.066]  This was World War III.
[02:12:32.566 --> 02:12:33.547]  Was economic warfare.
[02:12:33.947 --> 02:12:39.930]  Yeah, and we sent all of our money to China, then we have to beg them to lend it back to us so we can pay our bills.
[02:12:40.110 --> 02:12:43.011]  And so now the Chinese have over a trillion dollars of our debt.
[02:12:43.331 --> 02:12:45.933]  The Chinese are the global center for rare earth elements.
[02:12:46.033 --> 02:12:47.954]  Even those areas of this country are swimming in it.
[02:12:48.214 --> 02:12:49.174]  We're totally dependent on them.
[02:12:49.274 --> 02:12:53.176]  And they're the area, because they passed laws, nobody can mine it, to leverage us out.
[02:12:53.236 --> 02:12:54.557]  Everything's shut down in America.
[02:12:54.577 --> 02:12:55.637]  We're almost to the end.
[02:12:55.657 --> 02:12:59.639]  And if Trump says anything, we've got to call her saying she doesn't know if he's really a globalist selling us out.
[02:12:59.939 --> 02:13:00.840]  No, he's the real deal.
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.061]  But the deals have been so overrun.
[02:13:03.101 --> 02:13:04.563]  We've been so oversold out.
[02:13:05.003 --> 02:13:06.964]  Some globalists may have let Trump get in.
[02:13:07.004 --> 02:13:08.326]  There's theories from high-level folks.
[02:13:09.006 --> 02:13:16.352]  Not that he isn't real, but that he'll be like kind of a stopgap to do a better deal down the road for the sellout to the Chinese and the globalists.
[02:13:16.612 --> 02:13:25.499]  Because our own globalists sold us out so much, they don't even have a position now to have a checkmate over China to ensure that their interests for selling us out are met.
[02:13:25.859 --> 02:13:27.681]  Now, if you want the inside baseball, that's it.
[02:13:28.041 --> 02:13:32.946]  Trump's been allowed in for just better negotiation tactics on the sellout that already happened.
[02:13:33.486 --> 02:13:40.172]  Yeah, and China is basically the model for the New World Order, for population control, you know, the one-child policy, forced abortion.
[02:13:40.192 --> 02:13:42.515]  Yeah, they're the model, they're the leverage, they're the plan.
[02:13:43.095 --> 02:13:43.576]  This is it.
[02:13:44.116 --> 02:13:46.838]  Yeah, if we don't do something, we're going to become just like China.
[02:13:46.898 --> 02:13:50.040]  You're going to have a society where every level of your life is micromanaged.
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:56.344]  Even in China today, they started this population score, where they give you a score if you get a traffic ticket, your score goes down.
[02:13:56.664 --> 02:13:58.746]  If you're not polite on social media, your score goes down.
[02:13:59.206 --> 02:14:01.467]  They're a pioneer.
[02:14:01.507 --> 02:14:04.189]  And then you can't travel, then you can't eat, then you basically die.
[02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:05.150]  This is the mark of the beast.
[02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:05.890]  Oh, it is.
[02:14:06.010 --> 02:14:06.231]  It is.
[02:14:06.651 --> 02:14:09.392]  A totalitarian system, a dystopian nightmare.
[02:14:09.773 --> 02:14:10.893]  It's already here in China.
[02:14:10.993 --> 02:14:11.794]  It's here in China.
[02:14:11.974 --> 02:14:13.115]  And it's going to be here in the U.S.
[02:14:13.155 --> 02:14:14.335]  if we don't stand up and do something.
[02:14:14.355 --> 02:14:14.615]  That's right.
[02:14:14.635 --> 02:14:15.256]  If we don't fight.
[02:14:15.516 --> 02:14:15.796]  That's right.
[02:14:15.816 --> 02:14:17.297]  We're taking call after call when we come back.
[02:14:17.477 --> 02:14:20.979]  Alex and John and Alexandra and Jordan.
[02:14:20.999 --> 02:14:21.840]  We're on boom, boom, boom.
[02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:23.280]  Your call is quick when we come back.
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:23.661]  Briefly.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:25.220]  Or I won't be here.
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:26.901]  We've got to fund the operation.
[02:14:27.361 --> 02:14:38.945]  We have, developed by my father, an oral surgeon and a dentist, a colloidal silver, high-quality iodine, fortified toothpaste that is amazing.
[02:14:38.985 --> 02:14:40.185]  We also have it for children.
[02:14:40.906 --> 02:14:41.786]  It's concentrated.
[02:14:41.826 --> 02:14:43.106]  The children, it's still concentrated.
[02:14:43.126 --> 02:14:46.227]  It doesn't have peppermint and some of the other stuff in it because it's too strong for children's mouths.
[02:14:46.647 --> 02:14:47.848]  It's very, very concentrated.
[02:14:49.545 --> 02:14:52.467]  A lot of people mix it with other organic toothpaste that aren't as strong.
[02:14:52.868 --> 02:14:54.609]  That's how concentrated it is.
[02:14:55.150 --> 02:15:00.814]  It's 50% off because I want folks that haven't tried it to try it and to see how great it is and get hooked.
[02:15:01.274 --> 02:15:06.819]  And then the mouthwash, also fortified with no fluoride, but with iodine and colloidal silver.
[02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:13.502]  You brush, you mouthwash, then we've got immune gargle in 16-ounce, 3-ounce, and 1-ounce.
[02:15:13.942 --> 02:15:15.822]  Get them individually or get them all together.
[02:15:16.303 --> 02:15:21.484]  It's amazing, and it's a supplement you can then even swallow with a little spray bottle as well.
[02:15:22.124 --> 02:15:23.185]  It is just amazing.
[02:15:23.265 --> 02:15:24.685]  Read about the benefits for yourself.
[02:15:25.085 --> 02:15:25.686]  Find out about it.
[02:15:25.706 --> 02:15:35.148]  The new Combo Pack doesn't have any reviews because it just went up today, but read the thousands of reviews for the other items, five-star reviews, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:15:37.111 --> 02:15:37.491]  All of it.
[02:15:37.511 --> 02:15:38.472]  50% off.
[02:15:38.892 --> 02:15:41.394]  I want you to try Super Blue.
[02:15:41.414 --> 02:15:42.635]  50% off all Super Blue products.
[02:15:43.036 --> 02:15:44.797]  We've never had 50% off on all of them.
[02:15:45.097 --> 02:15:47.419]  The last time we had it off on one of the items was Christmas.
[02:15:47.799 --> 02:15:49.281]  So here we are five months later.
[02:15:49.301 --> 02:15:51.342]  We've got the special running.
[02:15:51.702 --> 02:15:54.765]  Even though it's about to sell out the next week or two, we get more in the middle of June.
[02:15:55.385 --> 02:16:00.409]  I want those of you on the fence to see how we believe this is the best toothpaste out there for you and your family.
[02:16:03.351 --> 02:16:03.692]  Pardon me?
[02:16:04.092 --> 02:16:07.337]  I think you are full of conspiracies, and I don't think that you are helping our country.
[02:16:07.357 --> 02:16:09.560]  Did you know the media misrepresents what I actually say?
[02:16:09.841 --> 02:16:12.825]  Like, give me an example of one of my conspiracies.
[02:16:13.867 --> 02:16:15.349]  That water is making the frogs skate.
[02:16:18.251 --> 02:16:26.255]  It might look like we're out in a bush somewhere, but 15 feet on either side, we're surrounded by agriculture, and the runoff ends up in this river.
[02:16:27.036 --> 02:16:32.059]  All of the algae is the result of all the nutrients, because a lot of fertilizers are used in agriculture.
[02:16:32.499 --> 02:16:35.961]  And once those fertilizers get into the water, you get these blooms of algae.
[02:16:36.781 --> 02:16:49.328]  Our data so far suggests that the mixture of pesticides causes an increase in stress hormones, and those stress hormones cause immunosuppression, which leads to the inability to respond to any kind of disease pathogen.
[02:16:49.628 --> 02:16:53.971]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the freaking frogs gay!
[02:16:54.711 --> 02:16:59.274]  It seems that even the tough bullfrog isn't doing so well with the toxins in this water.
[02:17:05.404 --> 02:17:06.325]  I got a chant going.
[02:17:07.425 --> 02:17:08.326]  I got a chant going.
[02:17:08.726 --> 02:17:09.627]  What about gay frogs?
[02:17:09.867 --> 02:17:10.748]  It's not funny!
[02:17:11.208 --> 02:17:13.289]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[02:17:13.329 --> 02:17:14.370]  Gay frogs!
[02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:18.933]  Hayes is testing the effects of chemicals like atrazine, a common herbicide.
[02:17:19.894 --> 02:17:24.277]  We have a whole family of animals where we've eliminated the female chromosome.
[02:17:24.577 --> 02:17:25.838]  Specimen zero one.
[02:17:27.085 --> 02:17:35.928]  These animals that we know are genetic males have been exposed to atrazine for their entire life, and many of these genetic males now are turning into females.
[02:17:36.888 --> 02:17:46.092]  And quite frankly, if you're a genetic male, it'd be nice if you developed as a genetic male, and now we have a chemical very common in the environment that's effectively sex-reversing animals.
[02:17:46.592 --> 02:17:52.214]  Now obviously it's not fair to judge a guy on one isolated dumbass clip, so here's a bunch of them.
[02:17:52.938 --> 02:17:54.420]  Alex is anti-gay.
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:57.062]  He's saying the chemicals are making people gay.
[02:17:57.543 --> 02:17:59.564]  Folks, it's making the frogs gay.
[02:17:59.885 --> 02:18:03.188]  Two-thirds of the frogs down in Houston are bisexual.
[02:18:03.468 --> 02:18:05.070]  Do you understand that?
[02:18:05.130 --> 02:18:06.791]  Turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[02:18:06.852 --> 02:18:07.192]  Boom!
[02:18:07.232 --> 02:18:07.592]  Boom!
[02:18:07.692 --> 02:18:08.393]  It's crap!
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:17.482]  The one that's sort of remarkable is this pair.
[02:18:19.690 --> 02:18:20.511]  These are both males.
[02:18:21.072 --> 02:18:25.596]  The one on the bottom, acting as the female, we affectionately refer to as Darnell.
[02:18:26.317 --> 02:18:31.202]  He's a genetic male that not only acts like a female, he lasics like a female.
[02:18:32.116 --> 02:18:37.241]  He, she has been exposed to Andrazine all of her, his, her life.
[02:18:37.261 --> 02:18:38.722]  I don't even really know how to reference it.
[02:18:39.062 --> 02:18:40.564]  This is Darnell's third clutch.
[02:18:41.144 --> 02:18:43.787]  So Darnell has sons and daughters that we've grown up.
[02:18:44.527 --> 02:18:45.809]  You can see eggs in the bottom.
[02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:48.191]  This is actually her second clutch for today.
[02:18:48.211 --> 02:18:52.074]  He, she has been copulating for getting close to 24 hours now.
[02:18:53.849 --> 02:18:57.452]  This is probably one of the most remarkable things I've seen in my work.
[02:18:58.513 --> 02:19:08.081]  Jones has argued that the government has the ability to control tornadoes, and that tap water is a gay bomb, and that they are putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[02:19:08.101 --> 02:19:10.323]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[02:19:11.244 --> 02:19:11.624]  FROGS!
[02:19:14.173 --> 02:19:15.174]  I am worried.
[02:19:15.234 --> 02:19:18.858]  This is the most common contaminant in ground and surface water and drinking water.
[02:19:19.299 --> 02:19:26.647]  And the level of atrazine that it took to make this male turn into a female is three times less than what's allowed in our drinking water.
[02:19:27.668 --> 02:19:28.008]  You know what?
[02:19:28.609 --> 02:19:31.772]  I guess it makes sense that Donald Trump wants to impress Alex Jones.
[02:19:32.052 --> 02:19:35.776]  Why would you want to drain the swamp if not to eradicate all those gay frogs?
[02:19:36.764 --> 02:19:37.544]  You stay there.
[02:19:37.765 --> 02:19:39.085]  You two stay where you are.
[02:19:39.606 --> 02:19:42.327]  It's not just a problem with frogs, we should be concerned about it.
[02:19:42.727 --> 02:19:47.029]  The water that's causing their problems is the same water that we're drinking and using to water our crops.
[02:19:49.951 --> 02:19:51.532]  Do you understand that?
[02:19:51.612 --> 02:19:53.273]  Turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[02:19:53.313 --> 02:19:53.653]  Boo!
[02:19:53.713 --> 02:19:54.033]  Boo!
[02:19:54.073 --> 02:19:54.873]  Screw this crap!
[02:19:54.953 --> 02:19:55.334]  Gay!
[02:19:55.374 --> 02:19:55.694]  Frogs!
[02:19:55.774 --> 02:19:56.534]  Friggin' frogs!
[02:19:56.634 --> 02:19:56.854]  Boo!
[02:19:56.914 --> 02:19:57.795]  It's not funny!
[02:20:06.152 --> 02:20:10.334]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.459 --> 02:20:32.642]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.486 --> 02:20:50.417]  We're going right to Alexandra and Alex and John and Jordan finish up calls here with the man running for Congress, ladies and gentlemen, who is sitting right next to me, who I hope can win Michael Schneider.
[02:20:50.437 --> 02:20:51.738]  We're not going to say who he's running against.
[02:20:51.758 --> 02:20:53.099]  It's a seven-person race.
[02:20:53.439 --> 02:20:55.780]  He's within a few points of winning.
[02:20:56.001 --> 02:20:58.722]  The person supposedly in the lead is the establishment person.
[02:20:59.163 --> 02:21:02.325]  But this is a key thing you wanted to talk about, how you have a plan
[02:21:04.546 --> 02:21:07.439]  Get ten people to go out and vote for Michael Schneider.
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:08.846]  Get those ten to get people to do it.
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:28.046]  If our listeners just keep telling people about InfoWars.com, if they just keep telling people about the free podcasts, the video streams, or just keep sending out the articles every day, and don't care what the people say to you on Twitter or Facebook or wherever, but just continue to get it out, or write your own articles about these subjects, it will bring the globalists to their knees.
[02:21:28.106 --> 02:21:28.966]  That's what they're scared of.
[02:21:29.507 --> 02:21:32.308]  They demonetize us to try to make us stop attacking the globalists.
[02:21:32.548 --> 02:21:33.268]  We don't care about that.
[02:21:33.328 --> 02:21:35.148]  We just want other funding mechanisms.
[02:21:36.009 --> 02:21:36.709]  We're in a war.
[02:21:36.789 --> 02:21:38.190]  We're not compromising our values.
[02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:39.150]  So briefly speak to that.
[02:21:39.810 --> 02:21:44.292]  Yeah, Alex, I've been studying this because I was studying how do you get people to go out and vote.
[02:21:44.372 --> 02:21:46.213]  And it's the same way getting any message out.
[02:21:46.253 --> 02:21:47.694]  You want to get the InfoWars message out?
[02:21:47.994 --> 02:21:55.017]  This is scientifically the very best way to get a message out is personal contact, especially personal contact from someone you know.
[02:21:55.077 --> 02:22:02.800]  That's why we've been telling everyone, hey, make a list of 10 people, your friends, your family, your co-workers, you know, people on your email list, whoever it is.
[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:03.881]  Everyone knows 10 people.
[02:22:04.241 --> 02:22:10.005]  Go out, tell those 10 people, go vote for Michael Snyder for Congress, and stay on them until they get back to you and say, yeah, I actually did that.
[02:22:10.125 --> 02:22:13.968]  It's the same story for other people that you know are good that are running for office.
[02:22:14.088 --> 02:22:14.628]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:14.708 --> 02:22:17.050]  This can be done all around the country, wherever you are.
[02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:19.091]  You need to get involved in the primaries, the elections.
[02:22:19.412 --> 02:22:31.120]  But yeah, wherever you are, just tell 10 people, get 10 people to go vote, and then tell those 10 people to get 10 people, because everyone knows 10 people, and it's that personal contact that is far more effective than anything else.
[02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:33.041]  So many people ask, how'd you hear about InfoWars?
[02:22:33.081 --> 02:22:35.243]  Somebody gave me a business card with your website on it.
[02:22:35.523 --> 02:22:42.047]  And even if you don't want to get yelled at by some globalist minion, be like, man, they really attack InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[02:22:42.087 --> 02:22:44.529]  I wonder why they just are always after him.
[02:22:44.589 --> 02:22:47.471]  Even if it was a horrible person, they act like he's the worst person on earth.
[02:22:47.791 --> 02:22:49.973]  Man, I went to his site and I found some shocking stuff.
[02:22:50.293 --> 02:22:51.654]  It's forbidden information.
[02:22:51.694 --> 02:22:52.314]  That's how you do it.
[02:22:52.354 --> 02:22:53.255]  OK, we're going to your calls.
[02:22:53.675 --> 02:22:54.856]  Some of the callers are hanging up here.
[02:22:55.616 --> 02:22:57.317]  Alexandra and then Alex and then John.
[02:22:57.337 --> 02:22:59.259]  No, it's Alexander, not Alexandra.
[02:22:59.619 --> 02:23:00.840]  My eyes used to be perfect.
[02:23:01.220 --> 02:23:01.840]  Hardly right over there.
[02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:04.402]  Alexander in Idaho, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:23:06.003 --> 02:23:06.924]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[02:23:07.304 --> 02:23:07.924]  Go ahead, thank you.
[02:23:09.405 --> 02:23:11.327]  Yeah, this is Captain Alexander with the U.S.
[02:23:11.427 --> 02:23:13.448]  Militia out here in Northern Idaho.
[02:23:14.189 --> 02:23:16.290]  And I actually interviewed Michael Snyder.
[02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:18.131]  Michael is a real trooper.
[02:23:19.212 --> 02:23:26.216]  And, you know, we've had a lot of controversy out here in Northern Idaho regarding Sherry with Readout News.
[02:23:26.877 --> 02:23:28.378]  I'm just going to go over this real quick.
[02:23:28.999 --> 02:23:32.321]  This morning I opened up an article Sherry had posted about Michael.
[02:23:32.802 --> 02:23:37.145]  She posted that there's a spider campaign under investigation.
[02:23:37.865 --> 02:23:45.731]  Well, what happened was Russ Fulcher's campaign out here in Idaho became under investigation with the FTC.
[02:23:48.665 --> 02:23:57.236]  I end up exposing some information out there on our militia page for the whole world to see regarding Les Fulcher back in 2013.
[02:23:57.296 --> 02:23:59.960]  Here's the deal, I can't really understand you.
[02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:07.329]  These calls today, I don't know if our phone system's going out or what it is, but it's like all just spraying about Michael Snyder's under investigation.
[02:24:07.489 --> 02:24:08.129]  I appreciate your call.
[02:24:27.737 --> 02:24:32.819]  And then they took that letter that they sent to FEC and said, posted on their website, said, is Michael Snyder under investigation?
[02:24:33.019 --> 02:24:35.020]  When they were the ones that filed it with FEC.
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:38.742]  So, and their complaint, they didn't say I did anything wrong.
[02:24:38.862 --> 02:24:41.103]  All they said was Michael Snyder has a gun.
[02:24:41.463 --> 02:24:46.605]  It's a classic dirty trick, but it's meant to get you off talking about it, and then you actually repeat it in a psych warfare deal.
[02:24:46.725 --> 02:24:46.925]  Exactly.
[02:24:46.945 --> 02:24:47.405]  That hurts you.
[02:24:47.665 --> 02:24:47.865]  Yeah.
[02:24:48.025 --> 02:24:51.447]  And people think they're helping you, and they're going, no, Michael's not under criminal investigation.
[02:24:51.827 --> 02:24:57.871]  Exactly, but what you need is a stunt to go over the top like some leftist trying to attack you and you punch him out or something.
[02:24:58.071 --> 02:25:03.814]  I'm not calling for violence, but that's what we've seen in Wyoming, Montana, is people think that you being anti-establishment is a bad thing.
[02:25:04.114 --> 02:25:04.714]  It's a good thing.
[02:25:04.734 --> 02:25:06.936]  But we do these campaign things for states.
[02:25:07.276 --> 02:25:12.279]  People call in and they think inside baseball, you know, like the color of the mountaintops at night or something.
[02:25:12.579 --> 02:25:15.580]  And it's just kind of this big audience worldwide doesn't know what they're talking about.
[02:25:16.361 --> 02:25:18.222]  Alex in British Columbia, Canada.
[02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:19.443]  You're on the air with Michael Snyder.
[02:25:19.463 --> 02:25:19.743]  Go ahead.
[02:25:21.578 --> 02:25:22.779]  I'm good brother, go ahead.
[02:25:36.849 --> 02:25:38.670]  It's so hard just to even find your channel.
[02:26:07.869 --> 02:26:14.172]  They've got, you know, just everything at the top that, oh, Russians are the ones that created the Jade Helm conspiracy.
[02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:17.313]  Oh, and the Texas governor is a Russian agent.
[02:26:17.653 --> 02:26:18.753]  And it's all just lies.
[02:26:18.814 --> 02:26:22.755]  And if you scroll down, scroll down, we got people watching on TV.
[02:26:23.235 --> 02:26:25.296]  Oh, then Wikipedia and all its disinfo.
[02:26:25.796 --> 02:26:30.298]  And then, oh, boom, InfoWars is like the sixth or seventh link down.
[02:26:30.758 --> 02:26:31.598]  So yes, that's what they do.
[02:26:31.638 --> 02:26:35.920]  But if you go to YouTube especially, they put like 50 negative videos on top against us.
[02:26:36.869 --> 02:26:56.259]  Yeah, no, and it's just disgusting and, you know, I know everything with this Mueller probe is going on and it's really imploding and I'm just waiting to see the FISA judges come out and say, hey, listen, you know, why did you guys give us this information knowing that Hillary Clinton had paid for it, knowing that it's totally bogus, totally fraud, right?
[02:26:56.279 --> 02:27:01.642]  That this is, you know, Lionel's been saying this for a few weeks, probably a few months now, saying that, where are the FISA judges?
[02:27:01.762 --> 02:27:04.504]  It's good to see these federal judges like Ellis come out and say, hey,
[02:27:05.174 --> 02:27:07.236]  This is clearly, you're just looking to impeach Trump.
[02:27:07.296 --> 02:27:08.738]  This has nothing to do with Manafort.
[02:27:08.758 --> 02:27:11.240]  15 years ago, whoa, what is this even about?
[02:27:11.741 --> 02:27:18.268]  But we need those, once those FISA judges come out, it's going to be huge because they're going to be able to turn this whole thing around.
[02:27:18.288 --> 02:27:20.009]  And it's, it's, and it's happening.
[02:27:20.089 --> 02:27:20.550]  It's happening.
[02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:21.090]  God bless you.
[02:27:21.191 --> 02:27:22.492]  And again, I wasn't mad at the last caller.
[02:27:22.732 --> 02:27:23.913]  I just couldn't understand them.
[02:27:24.114 --> 02:27:26.296]  And so just nothing drives me crazier than
[02:27:26.796 --> 02:27:28.998]  I just want to jump off a cliff.
[02:27:29.418 --> 02:27:29.838]  Not literally.
[02:27:29.858 --> 02:27:31.779]  They're going to throw me off a cliff tonight and say I wanted to do it.
[02:27:31.819 --> 02:27:32.480]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:33.040]  Great points.
[02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:34.461]  John in Wisconsin.
[02:27:34.481 --> 02:27:38.244]  Last caller here for Michael Snyder running for Congress, District 1, Idaho.
[02:27:38.284 --> 02:27:38.604]  Go ahead.
[02:27:38.624 --> 02:27:44.267]  I'm going to try again.
[02:27:44.307 --> 02:27:46.189]  Yeah, I can hear a little bit of distorted audio again.
[02:27:46.249 --> 02:27:46.569]  Go ahead.
[02:27:47.822 --> 02:27:49.783]  I said, Michael, I said, I hope you win tonight.
[02:27:50.203 --> 02:27:52.884]  You got my back, and I wish I lived in your state.
[02:27:52.924 --> 02:27:53.624]  I'd vote for you.
[02:27:53.944 --> 02:27:54.464]  Absolutely.
[02:27:55.044 --> 02:27:56.285]  Oh, well, thank you for your support.
[02:27:56.385 --> 02:27:56.885]  And you know what?
[02:27:56.905 --> 02:27:59.366]  We're hearing from people all over the country who've gotten behind us.
[02:27:59.906 --> 02:28:02.967]  And that's why, if you know anyone in Idaho, get involved.
[02:28:03.127 --> 02:28:06.468]  But wherever you live in the country, you can go to MichaelSnyder4Congress.com.
[02:28:06.728 --> 02:28:07.408]  You can donate.
[02:28:07.448 --> 02:28:11.990]  Help us make this big final push, because we need some help getting some mailers and doing some last-minute things out there.
[02:28:12.390 --> 02:28:14.312]  So guys, this is the opportunity.
[02:28:14.332 --> 02:28:16.294]  We have an opportunity to win this open seat.
[02:28:16.314 --> 02:28:20.457]  Because usually when you're running for Congress, you're running against a very powerful incumbent who's already in there.
[02:28:20.717 --> 02:28:23.119]  But in this case, the incumbent's moving on to run for governor.
[02:28:23.159 --> 02:28:25.441]  So, totally open seat, totally open race.
[02:28:26.022 --> 02:28:28.624]  And whoever wins the primary, the Democrats always lose there.
[02:28:28.644 --> 02:28:29.545]  So this is the election there.
[02:28:29.645 --> 02:28:31.287]  This is the election on May 15th.
[02:28:31.407 --> 02:28:32.509]  John, sorry we're out of time.
[02:28:32.589 --> 02:28:33.670]  Love you, but at least we got to you.
[02:28:33.690 --> 02:28:34.451]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:34.791 --> 02:28:36.073]  I'm gonna check our phone system.
[02:28:36.133 --> 02:28:40.458]  I don't think the calls all have this bad an audio, because I can't really understand every other thing they're saying.
[02:28:40.859 --> 02:28:43.262]  Or maybe there's a conspiracy that cell phones are getting worse and worse.
[02:28:43.302 --> 02:28:44.423]  They don't want us talking to each other.
[02:28:44.683 --> 02:28:45.564]  Everything goes digital.
[02:28:45.604 --> 02:28:46.405]  But man, I tell you.
[02:28:47.086 --> 02:28:47.707]  Unbelievable.
[02:28:47.948 --> 02:28:49.370]  Hey, Michael Snyder, thanks for being here.
[02:28:49.430 --> 02:28:52.314]  Vox Day, thank you so much for coming to town to visit us.
[02:28:52.614 --> 02:28:54.818]  Vox Day is coming up straight ahead.
[02:28:55.258 --> 02:28:57.622]  This is going to be some powerful information, so please stay with us.
[02:28:57.942 --> 02:28:59.725]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:29:02.202 --> 02:29:09.891]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:29:10.752 --> 02:29:14.817]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:29:15.317 --> 02:29:17.660]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:29:18.461 --> 02:29:21.585]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:29:23.072 --> 02:29:35.218]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:29:35.898 --> 02:29:50.965]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:29:51.966 --> 02:29:55.672]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[02:29:56.233 --> 02:29:57.936]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:29:57.976 --> 02:30:00.220]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[02:30:06.693 --> 02:30:09.794]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:10.354]  You're on the air.
[02:30:10.374 --> 02:30:10.894]  Thanks for holding.
[02:30:11.294 --> 02:30:12.394]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:30:12.594 --> 02:30:13.215]  Hey, brother.
[02:30:13.515 --> 02:30:13.875]  Good, man.
[02:30:13.895 --> 02:30:14.695]  Thank you for calling.
[02:30:14.775 --> 02:30:15.315]  Hey, hey.
[02:30:15.435 --> 02:30:19.836]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:30:20.056 --> 02:30:26.418]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:30:26.438 --> 02:30:28.258]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:30:28.358 --> 02:30:34.060]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:36.781]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:30:36.841 --> 02:30:39.282]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:30:39.342 --> 02:30:40.863]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:30:41.244 --> 02:30:42.825]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:30:43.305 --> 02:30:44.045]  And exactly.
[02:30:44.065 --> 02:30:48.288]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:30:48.668 --> 02:30:48.928]  Boom!
[02:30:49.069 --> 02:30:51.890]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:52.491]  It's amazing.
[02:30:52.531 --> 02:30:53.832]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:30:53.912 --> 02:30:56.774]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:31:03.843 --> 02:31:08.304]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:31:08.524 --> 02:31:13.206]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:31:13.826 --> 02:31:19.667]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[02:31:20.087 --> 02:31:32.671]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:31:33.431 --> 02:31:42.117]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:31:42.137 --> 02:31:44.039]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:31:44.379 --> 02:31:45.480]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:46.781]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:31:46.981 --> 02:31:48.182]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:31:48.302 --> 02:31:49.862]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:31:50.362 --> 02:31:51.963]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:31:51.983 --> 02:31:53.783]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:31:54.123 --> 02:31:56.724]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:31:56.764 --> 02:31:57.624]  This is insane.
[02:31:58.044 --> 02:31:59.664]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:31:59.924 --> 02:32:02.465]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:32:02.925 --> 02:32:04.445]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:32:04.465 --> 02:32:06.306]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:32:06.326 --> 02:32:08.186]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:32:09.046 --> 02:32:14.968]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:32:15.228 --> 02:32:16.568]  All just moderate dose.
[02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:26.066]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:32:26.106 --> 02:32:28.267]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:32:28.287 --> 02:32:29.668]  But thank you for committing.
[02:32:33.755 --> 02:32:36.578]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:32:36.938 --> 02:32:39.561]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:32:39.581 --> 02:32:44.326]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:32:44.806 --> 02:32:50.953]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:32:50.973 --> 02:32:54.076]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:32:54.416 --> 02:32:55.738]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:33:05.569 --> 02:33:08.177]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:31.207 --> 02:33:35.652]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:36.252 --> 02:33:37.694]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.697 --> 02:33:43.880]  You know, I've been aware of Vox Day's work for five, six years.
[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:48.604]  He's a best-selling author of SJW's Always Lying, SJW's Always Double Down.
[02:33:49.324 --> 02:33:49.925]  I've noticed that.
[02:33:49.965 --> 02:33:52.807]  They never give up, even though they're crazy people.
[02:33:53.348 --> 02:33:56.470]  He's the lead editor of a bunch of well-known comics.
[02:33:56.510 --> 02:34:06.358]  He's also a game and technology designer and is the creator of Info Galactic, the SJW free alternative to Wikipedia, VoxVersity.com.
[02:34:07.119 --> 02:34:10.983]  We've got a lot of other great websites as well, voxday.blogspot.com.
[02:34:11.784 --> 02:34:13.946]  Everybody knows I'm not an infighter.
[02:34:14.907 --> 02:34:16.268]  I don't fight libertarians.
[02:34:16.408 --> 02:34:17.630]  I don't fight nationalists.
[02:34:18.030 --> 02:34:19.291]  I don't fight capitalists.
[02:34:19.411 --> 02:34:20.433]  I don't fight patriots.
[02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:26.254]  I don't go after atheists that aren't trying to ban people's free speech.
[02:34:26.594 --> 02:34:29.016]  I don't go after liberals, classical liberals.
[02:34:29.036 --> 02:34:30.957]  I see myself as really a Jeffersonian liberal.
[02:34:31.378 --> 02:34:39.224]  I don't go as far as the French Revolution or the Illuminati because their plan was to take the whole liberal movement and flip it into total tyranny if you study the Jacobin plan.
[02:34:40.485 --> 02:34:44.148]  But I've also noticed that I wait too long with people like
[02:34:45.316 --> 02:34:51.902]  You know, the guy that took over Breitbart, when I knew from good sources he was bad news, I sat on the information because I didn't want to be an infighter.
[02:34:51.922 --> 02:34:53.143]  It's this holier-than-thou thing.
[02:34:53.403 --> 02:34:54.444]  I'm talking about Stephen Bannon.
[02:34:56.246 --> 02:35:02.232]  And now I have sat there and I've watched Glenn Beck go to Fox News, do the book deals, do everything he did.
[02:35:02.772 --> 02:35:08.477]  I was offered that exact position about a year before Beck showed up by basically the very same people, I'll leave it at that.
[02:35:09.298 --> 02:35:10.999]  Fox News offered me shows, all of it.
[02:35:11.339 --> 02:35:19.044]  They wanted to control what I was going to say, just like you go to the App Store on Apple, and my stuff's free, but the Fox News apps are on top of me, and it says advertisement.
[02:35:19.284 --> 02:35:21.585]  They follow me everywhere, but claim I want to be with them.
[02:35:21.705 --> 02:35:22.505]  No, that's not true.
[02:35:23.166 --> 02:35:28.049]  I want to build my own thing, but so many stations would say, we've got to drop you.
[02:35:28.129 --> 02:35:30.070]  Glenn Beck is going to leave.
[02:35:30.330 --> 02:35:33.372]  Sinclair Channel says you can't be on here if we have Glenn Beck.
[02:35:33.812 --> 02:35:37.034]  And then Glenn Beck was always getting my sponsors and in my business.
[02:35:37.990 --> 02:35:46.013]  And then I learned that Ben Shapiro is coming in trying to buy up the remnants of that with these Texas billionaires who aren't bad guys, by the way.
[02:35:46.753 --> 02:35:50.594]  Some pastors who worked their own, built their own big fracking company.
[02:35:50.634 --> 02:35:52.075]  They're worth about three million dollars total.
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:36:01.305]  And then I learned behind the scenes he's in my business again, and I learned that he was a lawyer, and all this other stuff with Talk Radio Network, and I learned some stuff from Michael Savage, and just, it gets crazy.
[02:36:02.346 --> 02:36:05.088]  And then I noticed how mainstream media force-feeds him constantly.
[02:36:05.648 --> 02:36:09.551]  And I noticed how we get force-fed Jordan Peterson.
[02:36:09.811 --> 02:36:16.235]  And I like a lot of what Peterson says, but you can't miss that they don't get censored, they get force-fed, they go on all the shows.
[02:36:16.455 --> 02:36:17.176]  Which is fine!
[02:36:17.776 --> 02:36:33.127]  But then when you get in my business and tell people don't come on my show and that I'm bad and I'm evil and you promote fake New York Times articles about me and it seems like your job is coming after me, I'm not putting up with Glenn Beck Part 2 where I put up with six, seven years of his crap before I unloaded on him and he went under.
[02:36:33.587 --> 02:36:34.248]  And he destroyed himself.
[02:36:34.268 --> 02:36:36.529]  So I'm going to shut up because we've only got him for this segment and one other.
[02:36:36.549 --> 02:36:38.191]  Maybe we can do five minutes in the next hour.
[02:36:38.231 --> 02:36:41.193]  But Vox Day joins us because Daria pointed out
[02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:47.272]  You know, Vox Day destroys these guys, and he's got all the inside baseball as well, because it needs to be done.
[02:36:47.312 --> 02:36:49.213]  I'm going to stop attacking him after I've done this.
[02:36:49.613 --> 02:36:51.314]  I might get Michael Savage on it about it, too.
[02:36:51.654 --> 02:36:55.275]  Just to kind of mark a buoy in the lake that, hey, there's rocks right here.
[02:36:55.675 --> 02:36:56.196]  Watch out.
[02:36:56.876 --> 02:37:01.958]  And to let these cynical, arrogant people know, I'm self-made, you're not.
[02:37:02.378 --> 02:37:04.079]  Vox Day's self-made, you're not.
[02:37:04.559 --> 02:37:05.419]  Get out of our way.
[02:37:05.699 --> 02:37:07.160]  So, Vox Day, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:37:08.831 --> 02:37:09.271]  You're welcome.
[02:37:10.212 --> 02:37:17.858]  That's kind of my little 3-4 minute intro, and we can cover the battlefield here, but I know we don't like to infight, but you're kind of an expert on the Shapiro guy.
[02:37:19.519 --> 02:37:22.902]  Well, I call the two of them Tweedlefake and Tweedlefaker.
[02:37:24.403 --> 02:37:29.887]  The reality of Ben Shapiro is that he was made back when he was a little kid.
[02:37:31.568 --> 02:37:33.830]  And I was at WorldNetDaily at the time.
[02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:40.934]  And he was just a little kid regurgitating Republican Party talking points.
[02:37:42.896 --> 02:37:51.162]  And he actually had a crisis of confidence after a couple years of doing that and emailed me and said, hey, you know, what should I do?
[02:37:51.222 --> 02:37:52.122]  Should I keep doing this?
[02:37:52.323 --> 02:37:58.647]  And I had encouraged him to go off and and really go off on his own, you know, figure out what you believe.
[02:37:59.328 --> 02:38:00.209]  What do you think is right?
[02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:01.970]  But
[02:38:02.862 --> 02:38:10.104]  It became very clear back in, uh, around the time of the Iraqi war that he made the wrong decision.
[02:38:11.044 --> 02:38:21.086]  And, you know, I published a column called The Littlest Chicken Hawk because what he was doing was saying that it was the most important thing for us to go and fight that war.
[02:38:22.487 --> 02:38:26.888]  But he wasn't willing to go and do it himself, despite the fact that he was about 18 years old at the time.
[02:38:28.248 --> 02:38:32.069]  And that's when I realized that, you know, this is a guy who is not
[02:38:32.825 --> 02:38:33.665]  Intellectually honest.
[02:38:34.086 --> 02:38:36.067]  He's a guy who doesn't have any personal integrity.
[02:38:37.027 --> 02:38:44.311]  And what he's attempting to do is get other young men to go and fight and die in his place.
[02:38:45.412 --> 02:38:46.532]  And that's not right.
[02:38:46.732 --> 02:38:56.557]  And what we've seen since then is that Ben Shapiro, along with Jordan Peterson, are essentially there to replace William F. Buckley.
[02:38:57.438 --> 02:38:59.379]  You know, neoconservatism has failed.
[02:39:00.968 --> 02:39:10.699]  It's no longer possible for them to read out the Sam Francis's, the Pat Buchanan's, the Joe Sobrin's and the Alex Jones's from the right.
[02:39:12.100 --> 02:39:15.884]  Because the neoliberal world order has failed.
[02:39:16.345 --> 02:39:17.847]  Multiculturalism has failed.
[02:39:18.708 --> 02:39:19.929]  Neoconservatism has failed.
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:25.985]  They're trying to come up with a way to keep the right on the reservation.
[02:39:26.426 --> 02:39:29.269]  And that's what Ben Shapiro is doing in the world of politics.
[02:39:29.730 --> 02:39:32.873]  And that's what Jordan Peterson is doing in the world of philosophy.
[02:39:35.096 --> 02:39:35.877]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39:35.917 --> 02:39:38.680]  And I get so busy just focused on the big picture, the 40,000 foot view that
[02:39:40.632 --> 02:39:46.394]  That then I just ignored these two and thought, well, they're a little more establishment and liberal, but at least, you know, they're getting out there.
[02:39:46.414 --> 02:39:53.878]  But then you see the force feeding of them by mainstream media, and then the counterfeit always tries to destroy the real thing.
[02:39:53.898 --> 02:40:04.702]  And I'm not saying I'm perfect, but let me tell you, baby, I myself, and everybody knows it, and these guys, especially Shapiro, but I can see they come together like two peas in a pod, are in my business.
[02:40:04.922 --> 02:40:08.904]  So that's why, I mean, it's just incredible how they just think they're God, or he thinks he's God.
[02:40:11.121 --> 02:40:15.704]  Well, I think that Shapiro is pretty basic.
[02:40:16.804 --> 02:40:21.487]  Shapiro wants to be a media star, and that's what he's focused on.
[02:40:21.848 --> 02:40:24.909]  He's actually less relevant than Jordan Peterson.
[02:40:24.989 --> 02:40:25.530]  Oh, I agree.
[02:40:26.670 --> 02:40:28.472]  Jordan Peterson is smarter.
[02:40:29.652 --> 02:40:33.835]  Jordan Peterson has a bigger organic audience.
[02:40:34.935 --> 02:40:37.377]  Shapiro's is mostly generated from the outside.
[02:40:38.208 --> 02:40:40.970]  Peterson's is actually mostly legitimate.
[02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:41.831]  I totally agree.
[02:40:42.471 --> 02:40:44.913]  He's got a lot of talent in his own right.
[02:40:44.933 --> 02:40:46.134]  He's the more dangerous of the two.
[02:40:47.335 --> 02:41:00.404]  But the problem is that Peterson's philosophy, which I call Jordanetics, is ultimately anti-Christian, it's poisonous, and it's riddled from start to finish with mental illness.
[02:41:00.424 --> 02:41:06.449]  I mean, he is what happens when you cross Bill Kristol with L. Ron Hubbard and give it a PhD.
[02:41:09.832 --> 02:41:10.372]  Absolutely.
[02:41:10.772 --> 02:41:16.573]  Please keep breaking it down because, man, I started looking at video of him close up in his eyes, and you can't fake that.
[02:41:16.613 --> 02:41:18.934]  I mean, he looks like he is wound up.
[02:41:20.294 --> 02:41:26.255]  Well, Jordanetics was created to replace the failure of the new atheism and the neoliberal world order.
[02:41:26.996 --> 02:41:29.876]  And so, you know, there's three components to the West.
[02:41:30.556 --> 02:41:34.197]  The European nations, the Greco-Roman legacy, and Christianity.
[02:41:34.969 --> 02:41:40.032]  Jordan Peterson is explicitly opposed to two of the three, and he ignores the other one.
[02:41:41.093 --> 02:41:47.817]  What a lot of people don't realize is that Peterson was a card-carrying socialist himself, just like Irving Kristol and the original neocons.
[02:41:48.757 --> 02:41:56.222]  And the influence that he cites, Nietzsche, Freud, Jung, and Darwin,
[02:41:56.992 --> 02:42:00.015]  They're the source of the problem that we're facing today.
[02:42:00.395 --> 02:42:02.477]  They're not part of the solution.
[02:42:02.997 --> 02:42:07.961]  And that's why Jordanetics is an incoherent cargo cult of crazy.
[02:42:08.682 --> 02:42:09.623]  What's it got?
[02:42:09.683 --> 02:42:14.487]  Dishonesty, hypocrisy and moral failure is hidden behind this
[02:42:15.319 --> 02:42:17.800]  Huge fog of incoherency.
[02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:18.660]  Well, that's right.
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:20.701]  Anybody who's read Carl Jung, it's very sexy.
[02:42:20.721 --> 02:42:21.761]  A lot of it's true.
[02:42:22.121 --> 02:42:23.781]  But then where it leads you is very destructive.
[02:42:23.801 --> 02:42:24.642]  We can probably talk about that.
[02:42:24.662 --> 02:42:28.543]  But Star Wars, the whole New Age movement, is a launch of that.
[02:42:28.623 --> 02:42:29.983]  And they act like it's something new.
[02:42:30.363 --> 02:42:33.144]  It's very ancient, as you know, as a smart guy who studied history.
[02:42:33.604 --> 02:42:35.485]  And so I just hadn't paid enough attention to this.
[02:42:36.165 --> 02:42:40.066]  But I did see these two guys getting together to take over the Glenn Beck operation.
[02:42:40.086 --> 02:42:42.387]  The only reason I know is they offered me to buy the Blaze.
[02:42:42.407 --> 02:42:42.987]  They tried to get me to
[02:42:44.153 --> 02:42:46.535]  Buy his $25 million a year cable channel?
[02:42:46.595 --> 02:42:46.776]  No.
[02:42:46.936 --> 02:42:52.080]  I don't have that money anyways, but it's like, but these two have got the Texas money now.
[02:42:52.681 --> 02:42:57.546]  And so it's like having the two move into Texas on me, which I've heard the word's gonna happen.
[02:42:57.586 --> 02:42:58.627]  I just don't think I can handle it.
[02:42:58.647 --> 02:42:59.768]  We'll be back with Vox Day.
[02:43:02.526 --> 02:43:04.507]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:04.607 --> 02:43:04.947]  Go ahead.
[02:43:05.228 --> 02:43:07.429]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:07.449 --> 02:43:10.471]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:11.311 --> 02:43:12.412]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:12.732 --> 02:43:14.453]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:15.153 --> 02:43:17.235]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:17.475 --> 02:43:21.477]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:21.497 --> 02:43:23.999]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:24.799 --> 02:43:27.121]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:27.481 --> 02:43:28.581]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:28.842 --> 02:43:29.722]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:29.962 --> 02:43:30.983]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:31.423 --> 02:43:32.463]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:32.503 --> 02:43:33.584]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:43:33.604 --> 02:43:34.404]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:40.045]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:40.365 --> 02:43:44.646]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:44.866 --> 02:43:47.747]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:48.007 --> 02:43:48.387]  You understand?
[02:43:48.487 --> 02:43:49.747]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:50.128 --> 02:43:51.248]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:52.228 --> 02:43:57.154]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:43:57.835 --> 02:43:58.536]  Do you understand?
[02:43:58.556 --> 02:43:59.797]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:00.198 --> 02:44:01.660]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:44:06.348 --> 02:44:09.532]  You know, everybody, my critics told me that I can't talk to you.
[02:44:09.652 --> 02:44:10.673]  You know that, right?
[02:44:10.933 --> 02:44:17.921]  That they attacked me and said, he's been on InfoWars, so we can't listen to anything he says that might be productive and useful.
[02:44:19.102 --> 02:44:21.625]  But I say Kanye changed everything.
[02:44:22.386 --> 02:44:24.027]  And you know, I can love you.
[02:44:24.047 --> 02:44:25.349]  I don't have to disagree with you.
[02:44:26.009 --> 02:44:29.733]  So, I'm going to take Kanye's lead and say, I'm Switzerland.
[02:44:29.914 --> 02:44:33.758]  I'll go on whatever show wants me to talk to their audience and share my opinion.
[02:44:33.958 --> 02:44:39.203]  This whole freedom of speech business, it's a big, big idea, and it keeps working.
[02:44:39.564 --> 02:44:46.932]  Like, every time we get a little more freedom of speech, people are a little happier and they act surprised and say, whoa, freedom of speech worked again.
[02:44:47.612 --> 02:44:48.132]  Surprise.
[02:44:48.552 --> 02:44:53.394]  So, Kanye is reminding us something I guess we forgot.
[02:44:53.574 --> 02:44:55.874]  Candice Owens is also part of the conversation.
[02:44:55.934 --> 02:45:00.736]  They're reminding us of the power of free, you know, free thought, free speech.
[02:45:00.976 --> 02:45:03.576]  The ability to talk to the people who are not your best friend.
[02:45:03.596 --> 02:45:06.657]  You know, the ability to talk to somebody without saying you can't talk to them.
[02:45:06.777 --> 02:45:08.858]  This is a big, big, big deal.
[02:45:09.218 --> 02:45:09.839]  Have you had a chance?
[02:45:09.859 --> 02:45:10.940]  I mean, who's been tweeting your stuff?
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:12.561]  It's not like I'm enamored with a star.
[02:45:13.002 --> 02:45:18.127]  I'm enamored by top-tier, you know, second or third, first, largest music person in the world.
[02:45:18.227 --> 02:45:19.368]  I think we've hit the tipping point.
[02:45:19.408 --> 02:45:22.251]  As you said during the break, in your own words, something's happening.
[02:45:22.751 --> 02:45:24.533]  So can you speak to that and what is happening?
[02:45:24.673 --> 02:45:26.054]  There seems to be some kind of
[02:45:27.275 --> 02:45:37.581]  I hate to go new age, because it would be easy to go into woo-woo land, but it feels like the way people are looking at things is changing.
[02:45:37.781 --> 02:45:39.242]  Now, Trump is a big part of that.
[02:45:39.382 --> 02:45:40.683]  North Korea is a big part.
[02:45:40.803 --> 02:45:41.824]  Kanye is a part.
[02:45:42.504 --> 02:45:52.110]  And I think that people are noticing that when we think in non-traditional ways and get out of the box and say, okay, we thought this was impossible.
[02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:54.111]  Let's just think, what if it isn't?
[02:45:54.952 --> 02:46:01.306]  So maybe the whole thing is just simply defined by possibility and I think that our notion of what is possible is
[02:46:02.259 --> 02:46:03.821]  Got expanded recently.
[02:46:04.301 --> 02:46:06.603]  North Korea and Kanye being the best examples of it.
[02:46:07.064 --> 02:46:08.265]  But I think there's more to come.
[02:46:08.465 --> 02:46:13.350]  It's just, you know, I'm not going to get scientific about this because I can't offer you data.
[02:46:13.850 --> 02:46:24.581]  But now that the physical problems have been solved, you know, we can get enough physical resources to where we need it if we can figure out, you know, where to put it and how to get it there.
[02:46:25.862 --> 02:46:31.447]  So, we're in a world where there's great possibility, and we're being held back by the way we think of things.
[02:46:31.927 --> 02:46:36.511]  And we're watching that the way we think of things is being changed by thought leaders.
[02:46:36.531 --> 02:46:45.839]  I'll tell you, you know, when I was first asked to come on the show today by your producer, my first thought was, I'm too busy, too much going on, I'd love to, but I don't have time.
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:52.305]  And then I saw people telling me in the news, hey, you can't go on InfoWars, and I said, well, I'm going to clear my schedule now.
[02:46:52.765 --> 02:46:55.247]  Because Kanye says I could talk to anybody I want.
[02:46:56.648 --> 02:46:58.649]  So, it's changing things.
[02:47:06.594 --> 02:47:09.196]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:42.523 --> 02:47:48.548]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:47:48.908 --> 02:47:52.431]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:52.571 --> 02:47:57.996]  So, you've got a bunch of billionaires, the Mercers, and then you've got these Texas billionaires.
[02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:03.123]  Who are financing most of the conservative websites and news.
[02:48:03.683 --> 02:48:12.290]  None of them except WorldNetDaily, where our colleague has done works before Vox Day, is actually operating on its own, selling books and things like that.
[02:48:12.690 --> 02:48:14.051]  We do the same thing here at InfoWars.
[02:48:15.572 --> 02:48:17.554]  Drudge is self-made as well.
[02:48:18.114 --> 02:48:20.316]  And I'm not bashing folks that got some help somewhere.
[02:48:20.436 --> 02:48:26.061]  It's just that there's always something twisted about it because they're always following somebody else's blueprint.
[02:48:27.163 --> 02:48:32.007]  And they're always seeking to then get rid of the organic movement.
[02:48:33.021 --> 02:48:39.446]  And that's why I get angry, is that I want to be left alone, and be able to do my own operation.
[02:48:39.466 --> 02:48:46.351]  I've already got Hillary after me, I've already got the globalists after me, I've already got all that stuff, and I really want to win this fight.
[02:48:46.391 --> 02:48:49.253]  But see, the real way to attack us is to be the opposition.
[02:48:49.593 --> 02:49:01.903]  So they're posing that they're the libertarians, they're the nationalists, and with Vox Deus saying he's going to be with us 15 minutes to the next hour, and then Matt Bracken's going to join us, is so on target when you've read the history books, the facts, and everything he's saying, I'm ashamed that
[02:49:02.737 --> 02:49:06.158]  I've let Peterson sneak up on me and all the rest of it because I've been so busy.
[02:49:06.838 --> 02:49:23.543]  It's people, quote, in our movement we've got to watch out for because when you see them being worshipped on all the channels and you see Atlantic Monthly, the establishment, leftist publication, worshipping Peterson and making him a victim of the left, you can see that this is how they think they're coming in to take over.
[02:49:23.603 --> 02:49:25.463]  I don't want to say Peterson's a bad guy.
[02:49:25.503 --> 02:49:26.704]  Maybe he doesn't know this.
[02:49:27.124 --> 02:49:28.544]  Maybe he doesn't understand it.
[02:49:29.504 --> 02:49:31.485]  But I know that when he's on these other shows,
[02:49:32.265 --> 02:49:34.208]  And I'm not saying this about him because he hasn't come on the show.
[02:49:34.228 --> 02:49:36.771]  We've put out feelers and stuff, and he hasn't come on.
[02:49:36.811 --> 02:49:41.917]  That just shows, you know, that he's at least scared of this information, doesn't want to get boycotted, whatever.
[02:49:42.417 --> 02:49:48.805]  Or he actively, with the people he works with, doesn't want to, in his view, as the leftists do, where there's no platforming,
[02:49:49.145 --> 02:49:49.545]  Elevate us!
[02:49:49.565 --> 02:49:51.127]  Well, we're already quite elevated, thank you.
[02:49:51.467 --> 02:49:52.948]  Over a thousand articles a day attacking us.
[02:49:52.968 --> 02:50:04.677]  But getting past InfoWars, Vox Dei's got the floor in this segment and the next two to really break down those three branches of Western civilization, how the attack's happening, and how he thinks we can hopefully turn this around.
[02:50:04.717 --> 02:50:14.044]  But I do understand now that this is the new constellation of attack where they're already making everything godless, so now they're going to come in with kind of a Carl Jung reboot.
[02:50:14.284 --> 02:50:17.727]  So please break it down for us, author of SJW's Always Lie.
[02:50:20.020 --> 02:50:26.186]  Well, the thing that people are beginning to understand is the way that SJWs infiltrate institutions.
[02:50:26.866 --> 02:50:28.628]  We've seen it happen with the colleges.
[02:50:29.189 --> 02:50:31.571]  We've seen it happen in the corporations.
[02:50:31.631 --> 02:50:34.393]  Now we're seeing it happen in the open source movement.
[02:50:35.835 --> 02:50:41.960]  What a lot of people don't understand is that a similar process often takes place on the right.
[02:50:43.201 --> 02:50:45.724]  And the way that you can usually tell
[02:50:46.861 --> 02:50:51.144]  Is when somebody is being actively pushed and elevated.
[02:50:51.164 --> 02:50:51.944]  I'll give you an example.
[02:50:52.845 --> 02:50:56.767]  I was nationally syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate.
[02:50:57.748 --> 02:51:09.975]  They wanted me to be the replacement for William William F Buckley, which is kind of ironic, but at the same time or a few months later, Shapiro was syndicated by Creator Syndicate.
[02:51:10.856 --> 02:51:16.199]  And what creators did in order to get him into all the newspapers was that they told
[02:51:17.074 --> 02:51:23.918]  The paper said, well, if you want our desirable columns, you have to take this column and that column.
[02:51:24.498 --> 02:51:30.041]  And so that's why you tend to see these people come in out of nowhere and then suddenly blow up.
[02:51:30.521 --> 02:51:35.824]  It's because they're being packaged as a deal with the desirable columnist.
[02:51:36.884 --> 02:51:40.706]  I tried to talk... It's the exact same thing with Clear Channel and all these deals.
[02:51:40.727 --> 02:51:42.167]  That's exactly how they operate.
[02:51:42.848 --> 02:51:43.148]  Exactly.
[02:51:43.188 --> 02:51:45.209]  So you know the system's force feeding.
[02:51:46.676 --> 02:51:47.096]  Exactly.
[02:51:47.116 --> 02:51:59.720]  And beyond that, you can also tell because the left-wing media and the mainstream media is willing to allow them to be the official opposition.
[02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:07.922]  And they do that because, in one way or another, these individuals are serving the mainstream narrative.
[02:52:08.382 --> 02:52:11.923]  Now, these people are not all the same.
[02:52:11.983 --> 02:52:16.384]  For example, Richard Spencer served the mainstream narrative in one way,
[02:52:17.481 --> 02:52:22.205]  Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson serve the narrative in a very different way.
[02:52:22.805 --> 02:52:29.111]  You know, a lot of people don't understand, but when the alt-right first came onto the scene, I got contacted by the New York Times.
[02:52:29.131 --> 02:52:35.576]  I got contacted by all these major mainstream news institutions.
[02:52:36.437 --> 02:52:41.886]  And what was fascinating was that they never ever ran any of the interviews with me.
[02:52:42.226 --> 02:52:45.431]  They never ran any of the questions and answers.
[02:52:45.451 --> 02:52:46.133]  Same thing with me.
[02:52:46.193 --> 02:52:47.154]  They're only getting intel.
[02:52:47.174 --> 02:52:49.738]  And I want you to get to why you think that was, but let me just back up what you're saying.
[02:52:50.612 --> 02:52:57.680]  They use the alt-right that they fund and control, that Hillary defined, to then demonize the entire conservative, libertarian, nationalist movement as racist.
[02:52:57.960 --> 02:53:04.367]  They then use a Shapiro that they build up to then gatekeep and second that everybody else is bad but them, it's a pincer attack.
[02:53:04.687 --> 02:53:08.771]  So they use their staged right-wing racist, and then they have their elevated
[02:53:12.794 --> 02:53:14.014]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:53:14.034 --> 02:53:16.195]  And the thing is, it's not even a new program.
[02:53:16.215 --> 02:53:18.916]  If you look at the history of it, you can see that Richard Spencer is David Duke.
[02:53:33.570 --> 02:53:41.532]  You can see that Ben Shapiro is the sort of William F. Buckley... Now quantify that.
[02:53:41.552 --> 02:53:46.813]  The listeners may not know that they declassified that National Review was CIA-funded, just like Ms.
[02:53:46.853 --> 02:54:00.677]  Magazine, and that the Trotskyites that were then marooned in Mexico and then came to the U.S., quote, turned against the Soviet Union, but were actually taken into the Central Intelligence Agency and then repurposed to go take over the conservative movement.
[02:54:00.837 --> 02:54:01.757]  That's all declassified.
[02:54:02.898 --> 02:54:05.659]  Yeah, and you see that with Jordan Peterson as well.
[02:54:06.019 --> 02:54:11.940]  He says in his book he was a card-carrying socialist, very active in the socialist movement during college.
[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:18.541]  And he claims to have had this epiphany after having all of these horrific dreams and so forth.
[02:54:20.202 --> 02:54:25.243]  But the reality is, is that he is actively attempting
[02:54:26.098 --> 02:54:29.561]  To try to keep the right from moving too far right.
[02:54:29.961 --> 02:54:34.004]  What he is attempting to do is he is attempting to provide an alternative.
[02:54:34.801 --> 02:54:47.469]  To the growing number of people who want a return to the values of 1950s America, who want to return to the values of white Christian America.
[02:54:47.569 --> 02:55:01.677]  And they know that wave is unstoppable, so they're going to hijack it with a new, watered-down, controlled opposition to then grab all that momentum in a judo move and steal it, and then once they've got control, use that wave to crush the real movement.
[02:55:03.243 --> 02:55:04.624]  Well, I think that's the plan.
[02:55:05.044 --> 02:55:15.930]  I think that it is very obvious that it's not working very well, simply because over here in Europe, the nationalist parties are absolutely crushing the neoliberal parties.
[02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:20.993]  You know, in some of the European nations, the left barely even exists anymore.
[02:55:21.413 --> 02:55:28.817]  And the only thing that is allowing the neoliberals to stay in control in the United States is the two-party system.
[02:55:29.197 --> 02:55:30.818]  But Donald Trump has broken that.
[02:55:31.491 --> 02:55:40.097]  And so I think that in the United States, we're seeing a nexus of the sort that we saw when the Republicans replaced the Whig Party.
[02:55:40.678 --> 02:55:46.782]  And that's why you're seeing people like Jennifer Rubin and people like Ben Shapiro and people like Ben Crystal.
[02:55:47.748 --> 02:55:49.409]  And again, that's how it works in America.
[02:55:49.669 --> 02:55:58.253]  You don't get a third party, one of the old parties dies and a new one takes it over, so they're reversing what we're organically doing, threatening to do that again to try to derail us.
[02:55:58.293 --> 02:55:58.813]  That's going to fail.
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:10.841]  Oh, there's no question.
[02:56:11.461 --> 02:56:21.467]  I think that the Evan McMillan disaster that Bill Kristol created demonstrates how inept this strategy is.
[02:56:22.088 --> 02:56:25.930]  And the thing that you have to keep in mind is that these are just people.
[02:56:26.951 --> 02:56:29.132]  They are as fallible as anyone else.
[02:56:29.533 --> 02:56:31.474]  They make mistakes like anyone else.
[02:56:32.294 --> 02:56:36.837]  I just finished reading Jordan Peterson's Twelve Rules of Life, An Antidote to Chaos.
[02:56:38.604 --> 02:56:40.285]  It's absolutely nuts.
[02:56:41.065 --> 02:56:47.369]  You know, it's got these sort of basic, you know, clean your room, stand up straight, all that sort of thing.
[02:56:47.609 --> 02:56:54.492]  Well, what good is a clean room in Rome going to do when Alaric the Goth is sacking your city?
[02:56:55.273 --> 02:57:05.778]  You know, what good is standing up straight going to do when the Turks are crossing the border and beheading everyone?
[02:57:06.705 --> 02:57:16.531]  You know, if you look at their response to the current historical situation in the West, it's so inadequate as to be a category error.
[02:57:16.711 --> 02:57:17.832]  It's like dog training.
[02:57:17.852 --> 02:57:19.393]  I was reading your articles, it's like dog training.
[02:57:19.413 --> 02:57:26.397]  They're telling us to, like we're mental patients, go through dog training, but conservatives are supposed to get a blueprint for the mental patient left.
[02:57:26.417 --> 02:57:27.238]  No, we're competent.
[02:57:27.458 --> 02:57:29.959]  We don't need to be taught how to wipe our ass by Jordan Peterson.
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:32.621]  We certainly don't.
[02:57:33.161 --> 02:57:35.983]  And the remarkable thing is that
[02:57:37.191 --> 02:57:43.881]  The amount of disinformation and the amount of falsehood... Let's talk about it, Vox Day.
[02:57:43.961 --> 02:57:44.322]  Amazing.
[02:57:44.362 --> 02:57:45.543]  And why hasn't Vox Day been on?
[02:57:45.583 --> 02:57:46.365]  This guy's awesome.
[02:57:46.565 --> 02:57:47.666]  We'll be right back with Vox Day.
[02:57:47.686 --> 02:57:48.888]  We've been reading this stuff for years.
[02:57:48.908 --> 02:57:50.450]  Good job of the producer saying Vox Day.
[02:57:53.857 --> 02:58:12.170]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:58:12.270 --> 02:58:15.292]  But the immune wall is incredible, and folks,
[02:58:15.492 --> 02:58:17.694]  Other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-$80.
[02:58:17.714 --> 02:58:19.216]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:58:19.656 --> 02:58:24.161]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more.
[02:58:24.681 --> 02:58:25.823]  It is concentrated.
[02:58:26.043 --> 02:58:27.745]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:58:27.765 --> 02:58:33.471]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:58:33.591 --> 02:58:34.792]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:58:34.952 --> 02:58:36.674]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:58:36.834 --> 02:58:39.198]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:58:39.398 --> 02:58:40.660]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:58:40.820 --> 02:58:42.643]  Beta, Glucan, Olive Leaf, and more.
[02:58:43.184 --> 02:58:43.805]  Immune Wall.
[02:58:43.906 --> 02:58:46.510]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.

[02:59:54.301 --> 03:00:00.203]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.458 --> 03:00:18.700]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:27.782]  All right, Vox Day's with us for this little segment, the next segment, then Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, getting into the false flag dangers of how they're gonna try to stop Trump.
[03:00:28.322 --> 03:00:36.024]  Vox Day was just getting into Jordan Peterson, and since he's being force-fed by all the mainstream media who claims he has this
[03:00:36.764 --> 03:00:42.828]  You know, background where he got censored by the university, but now the mainstream media is just force-feeding him as the second coming of Christ.
[03:00:43.389 --> 03:00:44.510]  Well, okay, that's good then.
[03:00:44.530 --> 03:00:46.071]  Let's look at what he's actually saying.
[03:00:46.391 --> 03:00:55.958]  Now he's got these 12 rules of, you know, how to basically live in the prison ward, and Vox Dei dissects it, then we'll get into where he thinks they're going to counter-strike in the next segment.
[03:00:55.978 --> 03:00:57.199]  So, Vox, please continue.
[03:00:57.239 --> 03:00:58.160]  You just got cut off.
[03:01:00.201 --> 03:01:05.525]  Well, I was talking about the 12 rules of life, and the key thing to understand there is that
[03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:13.113]  It's a very limited example of Jordan Peterson's philosophy.
[03:01:14.033 --> 03:01:19.215]  And you can't understand the full extent of the philosophy until you read the maps of meaning as well.
[03:01:20.456 --> 03:01:27.799]  But I was really surprised to see that a lot of people think that the man is a Christian, or that the man is somebody who's on the right wing.
[03:01:27.959 --> 03:01:31.000]  A lot of people have said, oh, why are you attacking Jordan Peterson?
[03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:35.002]  You know, don't infight, don't punch right, and that sort of thing.
[03:01:35.999 --> 03:01:40.711]  And it was kind of astonishing because, you know, the guy is well to the left of...
[03:01:41.873 --> 03:01:44.114]  He's to the left of Jeb Bush.
[03:01:44.174 --> 03:01:49.096]  He's to the left of practically anyone you can name who's got an R after their name.
[03:01:49.596 --> 03:01:59.360]  And yet people have this idea that because he tells you to clean your room and because he got into it with some Canadian SJWs that he's on our side.
[03:01:59.620 --> 03:02:04.602]  He says there's two genders so we praise him like he discovered it and this is rocket science.
[03:02:04.942 --> 03:02:06.803]  Oh it's a liberal that finally agrees with us.
[03:02:07.603 --> 03:02:08.784]  And then now he'll be our new leader.
[03:02:08.864 --> 03:02:15.368]  I don't get how Christian right-wing money out of Texas is funding Ben Shapiro when he's not even a Christian, and now he's bringing Peterson in.
[03:02:15.388 --> 03:02:16.449]  But that's a question for later.
[03:02:16.669 --> 03:02:17.249]  Please continue.
[03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:32.119]  So, I looked very closely at what he was writing about, and the interesting thing, and what really attracted my attention at first, you can always tell a charlatan because they always redefine the terms.
[03:02:32.639 --> 03:02:36.802]  It doesn't matter whether you're talking about Richard Dawkins, whether you're talking about Sam Harris,
[03:02:37.569 --> 03:02:44.374]  They always redefine commonly used terms that everybody understands in order to try to snow you.
[03:02:45.835 --> 03:02:50.778]  And Peterson does this to an extent that even Sam Harris couldn't believe.
[03:02:51.659 --> 03:03:02.527]  There's a really amusing debate between the two of them where basically they spend two hours arguing about what truth is, and it's really, really eye-opening to see how Peterson
[03:03:03.702 --> 03:03:08.686]  essentially comes out, or doesn't essentially, actually comes out and says that truth is not truth.
[03:03:09.686 --> 03:03:23.416]  And so what you're dealing with is somebody who's not even a moral relativist, but is functionally an existential relativist, and his theology, such as it is, is essentially that of Aleister Crowley.
[03:03:23.496 --> 03:03:27.219]  Now, Aleister Crowley, of course... Do as thou wilt, is the whole of the law.
[03:03:27.939 --> 03:03:28.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:03:30.021 --> 03:03:31.442]  Peterson has a
[03:03:33.035 --> 03:03:38.541]  A vaguely worded, nebulous version of that that says exactly the same thing.
[03:03:38.561 --> 03:03:41.184]  You know, the truth is your truth.
[03:03:41.905 --> 03:03:43.567]  You have to create your own standards.
[03:03:43.587 --> 03:03:46.170]  A heartbeat in a baby isn't living.
[03:03:46.471 --> 03:03:48.293]  We don't kill babies, we just kill babies.
[03:03:48.373 --> 03:03:50.576]  It's this shit's... I mean, what it is is insanity.
[03:03:52.071 --> 03:03:53.995]  Oh, it's absolutely insanity.
[03:03:54.415 --> 03:04:00.285]  And the thing that really struck me, I mean, I noticed it immediately, immediately about Peterson.
[03:04:00.646 --> 03:04:04.453]  I even did a little periscope about it before I'd read his book or anything.
[03:04:05.060 --> 03:04:08.202]  I said, you know, this guy is the crazy Christ.
[03:04:08.302 --> 03:04:10.083]  I mean, he has a Messiah complex.
[03:04:10.143 --> 03:04:19.569]  He actually wrote to his father and said that he had an idea that no one had ever thought before, and it was so big that he was having trouble articulating it.
[03:04:20.169 --> 03:04:31.236]  And what he ends up coming out with is this half-baked hodgepodge of references that read like James Joyce's stream of consciousness.
[03:04:32.287 --> 03:04:36.369]  You know, really what it is is kind of the Vatican's universal world, whatever.
[03:04:36.389 --> 03:04:39.451]  It's just, it's a nut house.
[03:04:41.152 --> 03:04:51.517]  It is a nut house, and it's not a surprise that the second rule, the second most important rule of life, according to Jordan Peterson, is take your pills.
[03:04:52.563 --> 03:04:56.185]  Now, that is not an indication of helping.
[03:04:56.205 --> 03:04:57.566]  Hold on, we've got to go to break, back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:57.586 --> 03:04:59.167]  That sounds like the slogan from THX113A.
[03:04:59.267 --> 03:05:01.088]  Not this big guy unifying us.
[03:05:04.088 --> 03:05:06.129]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:05:06.389 --> 03:05:07.710]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[03:05:07.950 --> 03:05:11.491]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[03:05:24.757 --> 03:05:25.497]  The reality is
[03:05:25.777 --> 03:05:30.243]  It's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[03:06:20.598 --> 03:06:25.680]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:06:26.744 --> 03:06:29.085]  So, to control a movement, you want to lead a movement.
[03:06:29.405 --> 03:06:32.246]  And you've got the entire globalist media attacking me, attacking Trump.
[03:06:32.746 --> 03:06:33.806]  That's how you know we're real.
[03:06:33.826 --> 03:06:36.567]  Doesn't mean we're perfect, but we're not from the power structure.
[03:06:36.827 --> 03:06:38.848]  The whole world, nationalism's waking up.
[03:06:38.868 --> 03:06:39.348]  It's spreading.
[03:06:39.708 --> 03:06:40.449]  They're panicking.
[03:06:40.809 --> 03:06:41.649]  They don't know what to do.
[03:06:41.989 --> 03:06:45.310]  So, we have a very special guest joining us, Vox Dei.
[03:06:45.330 --> 03:06:46.611]  He has Voxversity.
[03:06:46.631 --> 03:06:47.531]  He'll tell us about that.
[03:06:47.991 --> 03:06:48.951]  I've read one of his books.
[03:06:49.331 --> 03:06:50.552]  SAW is always lying.
[03:06:51.192 --> 03:06:51.693]  Well, like I said,
[03:07:11.713 --> 03:07:35.363]  If one of the most important rules of life is to remember to take your pills, and the justification for it is that you are not too ashamed, naked, ugly, and worthless to be worthy of taking your pills, and that is the actual argument from the book, it's clear that we're not dealing with somebody who is mentally well.
[03:07:36.147 --> 03:07:43.910]  We're not dealing with a philosopher whose philosophy is based on the beautiful, the good, and the true.
[03:07:44.390 --> 03:07:47.891]  We're dealing with somebody who is fundamentally unbalanced and fearful.
[03:07:48.351 --> 03:07:53.573]  And if you read maps of meaning, you can see that you're dealing with a philosophy of fear.
[03:07:54.233 --> 03:07:57.534]  And that is the exact opposite of the Christian philosophy.
[03:07:57.734 --> 03:08:00.235]  As Christians know, we are not given a spirit of fear.
[03:08:01.175 --> 03:08:18.882]  So, I think that those who think that Jordan Peterson is doing good work simply do not understand the nature of his work and do not understand that getting someone to clean their room doesn't do any good when the devil's entering in.
[03:08:20.197 --> 03:08:21.318]  And there's something about the left.
[03:08:21.458 --> 03:08:23.119]  It worships the left-hand path.
[03:08:23.219 --> 03:08:24.860]  It worships being disturbed.
[03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:31.563]  It worships the, you know, the heroin-head tranny who's having convulsions on the side of the street.
[03:08:31.583 --> 03:08:33.104]  I mean, I've watched this in Austin.
[03:08:33.184 --> 03:08:37.566]  What is the theme from your deep research, Vox Dei, behind this?
[03:08:40.147 --> 03:08:42.148]  Well, the theme is the same as it always is.
[03:08:42.649 --> 03:08:44.009]  We must replace God.
[03:08:44.089 --> 03:08:45.530]  We must become as gods.
[03:08:46.250 --> 03:08:49.052]  You know, that was, that's, the source is Nietzsche.
[03:08:50.458 --> 03:09:01.562]  The intellectual source is Nietzsche, and the problem that they have is they want a Christian Western society, but they want to have it without Jesus Christ.
[03:09:02.082 --> 03:09:06.243]  They want to have the fruit of the tree while they cut the tree down.
[03:09:07.023 --> 03:09:10.544]  Now, we know that's not possible, but they refuse to accept it.
[03:09:10.564 --> 03:09:10.844]  That's it.
[03:09:10.884 --> 03:09:12.245]  They want the state to be Christ.
[03:09:15.010 --> 03:09:19.454]  I actually think that they want Christ to not exist.
[03:09:19.534 --> 03:09:30.903]  I think that they want to eat the apple, and they want to become as gods, and they don't want any intermediary between... Jesus Christ is the intermediary between man and God.
[03:09:31.523 --> 03:09:37.308]  They want to be gods themselves, so that means necessarily they have to kill God, and they have to kill Jesus Christ.
[03:09:38.028 --> 03:09:42.030]  And then they can become as gods, but of course we know that that's never going to happen.
[03:09:42.450 --> 03:09:46.492]  And if there's natural order, they don't ever build something beautiful and incredible.
[03:09:46.532 --> 03:09:47.772]  They just steal stuff.
[03:09:48.113 --> 03:09:56.556]  They always worship something fallen, because they're actually worshiping the opposite of order and beauty, so they can't ever produce anything good but rack and ruin.
[03:09:56.776 --> 03:10:01.919]  So they try to pull down the beautiful or occupy it, but then always end up basically burning it down.
[03:10:02.959 --> 03:10:04.620]  I mean, it really is just madness.
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:05.601]  It's just insanity.
[03:10:05.821 --> 03:10:09.183]  I mean, why would the left want to be like Venezuela or Cuba or North Korea?
[03:10:09.483 --> 03:10:18.088]  Why do kids wear $200 skinny jeans and have $1,000 smartphones and pull up in fancy cars to put on communist bandanas and go out and beat up, you know, people at a pro-gun rally?
[03:10:18.368 --> 03:10:22.030]  Because they existentially, at a spiritual level, hate God.
[03:10:23.431 --> 03:10:26.893]  Well, we're seeing exactly that right now in the comics industry.
[03:10:27.815 --> 03:10:36.621]  In the comics industry, they're turning Wolverine into a woman, they're turning one superhero gay, they're turning another one evil, they're making them all ugly.
[03:10:36.701 --> 03:10:42.726]  The women, they're making their breasts smaller and giving them haircuts and putting them in mom jeans.
[03:10:43.806 --> 03:10:47.349]  All of this is the same process that we've seen in architecture.
[03:10:48.030 --> 03:10:49.911]  It doesn't matter what the field is.
[03:10:49.991 --> 03:10:51.512]  It doesn't matter how small it is.
[03:10:52.073 --> 03:10:54.955]  We started a new comics line.
[03:10:55.315 --> 03:10:56.136]  It's called Arkhaven.
[03:10:56.476 --> 03:10:58.578]  And we've got some new comics coming out called Alt Hero.
[03:10:59.158 --> 03:11:06.404]  And the reason is because so many people kept asking me, hey look, they're ruining these comics that I love.
[03:11:06.804 --> 03:11:08.025]  Can you please do something?
[03:11:08.605 --> 03:11:10.747]  And so after three years of people asking me that,
[03:11:11.793 --> 03:11:12.554]  I finally did that.
[03:11:13.435 --> 03:11:15.196]  You mentioned Voxiversity a couple times.
[03:11:16.157 --> 03:11:18.960]  I looked at what Stefan Molyneux was doing.
[03:11:19.380 --> 03:11:22.964]  Stefan does these great videos, and they're very effective.
[03:11:24.265 --> 03:11:27.668]  I'm a writer, so I tend to prefer books to video.
[03:11:28.208 --> 03:11:32.012]  But a lot of people just said, hey, look, we really want you to produce these videos.
[03:11:32.512 --> 03:11:37.297]  So we opened up a freestarter, which is basically like Kickstarter.
[03:11:38.088 --> 03:11:41.194]  And only there's no SJWs controlling it.
[03:11:41.675 --> 03:11:43.579]  And so now we're making videos like...
[03:11:46.172 --> 03:11:49.194]  What the West needs to survive, what the nature of the West is.
[03:11:49.634 --> 03:11:58.998]  We're doing stuff on The Last Closet, which is about the way that pagan families tend to abuse their children.
[03:11:59.098 --> 03:12:01.719]  It's actually an autobiography called The Last Closet.
[03:12:01.739 --> 03:12:03.220]  It's really powerful.
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:05.621]  And again, why do pagan families tend to abuse their children so much?
[03:12:05.661 --> 03:12:09.843]  That's well known even in sociology, because it's an act of their religion to hurt the innocent.
[03:12:11.724 --> 03:12:12.124]  Exactly.
[03:12:13.265 --> 03:12:24.469]  There's a theory in China, for example, that if a dog is in pain when it's slaughtered for food, it tastes better.
[03:12:25.169 --> 03:12:30.791]  And that's why you see evil constantly preying on the innocent.
[03:12:30.831 --> 03:12:36.753]  One of the things that I've said is that an absolute heuristic for a philosophy being evil is
[03:12:37.632 --> 03:12:42.196]  Does it somehow rationalize, justify, or excuse having sex with children?
[03:12:43.216 --> 03:12:49.801]  If you catch even a whiff of that, you know that it's a philosophy of evil.
[03:12:50.682 --> 03:13:05.693]  And that's what I noticed immediately about Jordan Peterson's philosophy, is that it was essentially a philosophy that stated God was dead,
[03:13:06.403 --> 03:13:08.205]  That's right, and I have articles that just came out.
[03:13:30.390 --> 03:13:33.032]  Climate skeptics more eco-friendly than climate alarmists.
[03:13:33.192 --> 03:13:43.340]  Other big studies left six to more times likely to steal, nine times more likely not to give to charity, but they're way more likely to virtue signal and tell you how great they are.
[03:13:48.143 --> 03:13:56.210]  Lazy, uncreative, stupid, bad people that lust for power, even though once they get the power everything falls apart because they don't actually want to run anything.
[03:13:56.470 --> 03:13:57.531]  They have no responsibility.
[03:13:58.339 --> 03:14:00.400]  They want all the power with none of the responsibility.
[03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:08.262]  Well, that's something else you'll notice about these, call them, approved opposition figures.
[03:14:09.062 --> 03:14:14.184]  They're constantly writing articles and columns about how to fix the left.
[03:14:15.404 --> 03:14:19.765]  They're never actually taking the battle to the left.
[03:14:20.285 --> 03:14:23.306]  They're constantly saying, oh, you know, you better watch out.
[03:14:23.366 --> 03:14:25.827]  You're not going to like it if you keep doing what you're doing.
[03:14:26.876 --> 03:14:29.078]  You know, it's the same column.
[03:14:30.158 --> 03:14:31.819]  They write it like leftists.
[03:14:31.899 --> 03:14:36.963]  I mean, Shapiro sends out New York Times fake news articles about me going, look, Jones is mean, Jones is stupid.
[03:14:37.423 --> 03:14:42.086]  And he talks about how intellectual he is and has his writers write about what a genius he is.
[03:14:42.426 --> 03:14:43.487]  It's very immature.
[03:14:43.507 --> 03:14:44.447]  That's what I'm saying is.
[03:14:44.968 --> 03:14:49.150]  And then now it's being put out before us to be the opposition leaders and to police us.
[03:14:49.230 --> 03:14:51.972]  And like you said at the start of the interview, I don't think it's going well.
[03:14:52.072 --> 03:14:54.714]  What do they do as everybody rejects them?
[03:14:57.270 --> 03:15:02.032]  Well, I think that they're going to make yet another attempt.
[03:15:02.892 --> 03:15:11.455]  I think that we'll see new figures rise up just as quickly, and they'll try to learn from the mistakes that they made.
[03:15:11.515 --> 03:15:20.018]  I mean, the next Jordan Peterson will probably be somebody who is not mentally disturbed and is not taking anti-depression pills.
[03:15:20.758 --> 03:15:23.639]  I mean, the next Ben Shapiro
[03:15:24.500 --> 03:15:35.912]  Is probably going to be somebody who is actually an American, so that he doesn't have to, he's not constantly caught out, you know, pushing one set of policies to the side.
[03:15:35.932 --> 03:15:38.554]  We're going to do one more segment, and then Bracken says it's too powerful.
[03:15:39.335 --> 03:15:40.616]  And you know, here's the deal, too.
[03:15:40.917 --> 03:15:45.001]  You go to his own Daily Wire site, I went and read it, almost every comment hates him.
[03:15:46.004 --> 03:15:47.867]  I mean, don't they get people are rejecting him?
[03:15:47.887 --> 03:15:49.589]  We're not just here trying to hurt these people.
[03:15:49.850 --> 03:15:50.551]  I wish they were good.
[03:15:50.591 --> 03:15:51.352]  I wish they were real.
[03:15:51.693 --> 03:15:53.075]  I want to, you know, promote everybody that's good.
[03:15:53.415 --> 03:15:55.699]  It's just like, it's so obvious.
[03:15:55.759 --> 03:15:57.061]  It's so ridiculous.
[03:15:57.461 --> 03:15:58.603]  We'll be back with Vox Day.
[03:15:58.643 --> 03:15:59.985]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWires.com.
[03:16:02.771 --> 03:16:03.372]  Alpha Power.
[03:16:03.732 --> 03:16:04.533]  Here's what you want to know.
[03:16:04.753 --> 03:16:10.738]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[03:16:11.398 --> 03:16:14.942]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[03:16:15.822 --> 03:16:23.789]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[03:16:24.330 --> 03:16:27.692]  The average male or female enhancement
[03:16:28.653 --> 03:16:31.816]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[03:16:31.916 --> 03:16:33.617]  It just has a little bit in it.
[03:16:33.977 --> 03:16:39.081]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[03:16:39.361 --> 03:16:47.687]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[03:16:48.108 --> 03:16:49.148]  Nobody else does that.
[03:16:49.208 --> 03:16:51.890]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[03:16:52.271 --> 03:16:54.292]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[03:16:54.673 --> 03:16:57.495]  The second shipment is now in at Infowarslife.com.
[03:16:58.195 --> 03:17:00.138]  For more information, call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[03:17:14.082 --> 03:17:23.153]  We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him, and the free system that allowed it to happen in American history.
[03:17:23.653 --> 03:17:32.544]  From the highest levels of government to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us.
[03:17:33.104 --> 03:17:38.006]  But the ultimate insult is that they think we're so stupid that we'll let them get away with it.
[03:17:38.507 --> 03:17:54.834]  These saboteurs, slashing away with their leaks and sneers, their phony accusations and gagging sanctimony, drive their daggers through the heart of our future, poisoning our belief that honest custody of our institutions will ever again be possible.
[03:17:55.435 --> 03:17:59.477]  So they can then build their utopia from the ashes of what they burned down.
[03:18:00.177 --> 03:18:00.377]  No.
[03:18:00.938 --> 03:18:06.561]  Their fate will be failure, and they will perish in the political flames of their own fires.
[03:18:07.502 --> 03:18:13.606]  We are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedom's safest place.
[03:18:13.646 --> 03:18:16.328]  You know, I just heard that National Rifle Association ad.
[03:18:17.528 --> 03:18:21.349]  Airing on the radio side, TV side.
[03:18:21.389 --> 03:18:24.350]  We had a video ad going with Dana Lash.
[03:18:24.370 --> 03:18:25.550]  I always call her Losh.
[03:18:26.370 --> 03:18:27.310]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[03:18:27.330 --> 03:18:28.090]  Dana Lash.
[03:18:28.390 --> 03:18:30.011]  Great, smart, syndicated radio host.
[03:18:30.911 --> 03:18:31.371]  Great lady.
[03:18:31.931 --> 03:18:38.432]  Very successful spokesperson for the NRA that the left wants to basically kill and says is a witch and burn her, literally.
[03:18:40.053 --> 03:18:44.014]  They heard that ad running and Media Matters wrote stories about it.
[03:18:44.754 --> 03:18:45.874]  George Soros' outfit.
[03:18:46.983 --> 03:18:57.105]  Saying, oh look, the National Rifle Association's spending money with Alex Jones, like they're the arbiter, they're the boss, they're the god, and ooh, if they say it's bad, it's bad.
[03:18:57.725 --> 03:18:58.726]  No, morons.
[03:18:59.486 --> 03:19:00.506]  I like that ad.
[03:19:01.546 --> 03:19:05.567]  So, I have part of the radio ads on the network, so I run that ad.
[03:19:05.887 --> 03:19:08.208]  Even though one of those ads is about $1,000 a minute, I run it.
[03:19:08.248 --> 03:19:09.448]  And eat $1,000 every time.
[03:19:10.308 --> 03:19:11.168]  Comprende?
[03:19:15.220 --> 03:19:17.101]  I pay to air the NRA.
[03:19:18.201 --> 03:19:18.802]  Figure that out?
[03:19:19.662 --> 03:19:21.123]  So you guys don't get it, do you?
[03:19:21.863 --> 03:19:23.203]  I'm not doing this for money.
[03:19:23.884 --> 03:19:25.404]  I'm not doing this for myself.
[03:19:26.085 --> 03:19:29.386]  I don't sit there and calculate the work I do about me personally.
[03:19:29.746 --> 03:19:31.727]  It's about my children and the future.
[03:19:32.407 --> 03:19:33.328]  I'm a kamikaze.
[03:19:34.288 --> 03:19:36.149]  I don't care what you do to me financially.
[03:19:36.449 --> 03:19:37.790]  I don't care how you come after me.
[03:19:37.970 --> 03:19:38.870]  I'm committed.
[03:19:39.410 --> 03:19:43.252]  Because I know you're bad people and I want to get you off of our collective backs.
[03:19:46.078 --> 03:19:48.320]  Isn't that something you can now understand?
[03:19:48.801 --> 03:19:49.422]  Dumbos.
[03:19:53.226 --> 03:19:59.172]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:05.999 --> 03:20:08.622]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.755 --> 03:20:18.938]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:19.438 --> 03:20:24.564]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:20:26.539 --> 03:20:33.324]  You know, once you start figuring out history and the truth, it's not pattern recognition where you just keep agreeing that you're right.
[03:20:33.444 --> 03:20:34.184]  We know we're right.
[03:20:34.224 --> 03:20:36.186]  We know it works as a civilization.
[03:20:36.606 --> 03:20:37.526]  We know it's successful.
[03:20:37.546 --> 03:20:38.867]  We know there's a spirit of good and evil.
[03:20:38.887 --> 03:20:44.591]  A lot of people don't believe in God until they run into the globalists and these devil worshippers who really do hate innocence.
[03:20:45.192 --> 03:20:46.713]  They really do hate God.
[03:20:46.773 --> 03:20:47.933]  They really do hate Christ.
[03:20:48.614 --> 03:20:51.236]  And they'll go out of their way and blow their own feet off to get to it.
[03:20:51.616 --> 03:20:52.516]  Take Melania Trump.
[03:20:52.737 --> 03:20:54.518]  Without Trump even asking, you know, getting up and
[03:20:55.558 --> 03:20:56.519]  Saying the Lord's Prayer.
[03:20:58.540 --> 03:21:00.562]  Her right there, you know, getting a bill signed with her husband.
[03:21:00.642 --> 03:21:01.643]  Look how Trump looks.
[03:21:01.743 --> 03:21:03.444]  Male, strong, in command.
[03:21:03.484 --> 03:21:04.665]  His wife, powerful.
[03:21:05.589 --> 03:21:05.889]  I don't
[03:21:27.651 --> 03:21:29.131]  Criminal globalist elements.
[03:21:29.171 --> 03:21:32.832]  So Vox Day, we've got seven minutes left with him, and then Matt Bracken's taking over.
[03:21:32.852 --> 03:21:33.932]  Matt said he's happy to be waiting.
[03:21:34.572 --> 03:21:35.393]  He loves Vox Day.
[03:21:35.973 --> 03:21:42.674]  Vox, other key points you want to get out, and then again, quantifying for folks, why are SJWs so hateful?
[03:21:43.074 --> 03:21:44.214]  Why do they always lie?
[03:21:44.815 --> 03:21:45.775]  What is it about?
[03:21:46.115 --> 03:21:47.295]  They also never give up.
[03:21:47.315 --> 03:21:48.155]  They're cowardly.
[03:21:48.355 --> 03:21:49.135]  They'll hide.
[03:21:49.536 --> 03:21:52.616]  They'll never take the field against you, but they never give up.
[03:21:52.676 --> 03:21:55.257]  Even when they say they've given up, they're always plotting.
[03:21:55.297 --> 03:21:56.617]  They crave evil.
[03:21:58.373 --> 03:22:09.779]  Well, first, let me say that seven minutes is a little bit difficult to summarize something that, you know, spreads across two books, but I'll do my best.
[03:22:10.699 --> 03:22:24.826]  But before I get into that, I do want to say the single most important thing that we can do in the West is, number one, pray, and number two, support the nationalist leaders.
[03:22:25.809 --> 03:22:44.674]  Support the Donald Trumps, support the Victor Obens, support the Matteo Salvini's, the leaders who are rising up in defense of their nations just like Charles Martel did, just like Alfred the Great did, just like men have risen up over and over again.
[03:22:44.694 --> 03:22:54.817]  I was reading the Dark is Rising books to one of my kids and this whole cyclical nature of good versus evil
[03:22:55.994 --> 03:23:02.816]  It is normal, and it falls to us to fight the battles, both spiritual and material.
[03:23:03.957 --> 03:23:06.638]  Now, to get into the SJWs, why do they do what they do?
[03:23:07.278 --> 03:23:12.960]  It's because they are hung up in emotional pain.
[03:23:14.022 --> 03:23:25.492]  An SJW is usually an individual who experienced a lot of emotional pain, whether it was rejection, whether it was from the parents, whether it was from kids.
[03:23:26.853 --> 03:23:32.798]  Whenever you look at a hardcore SJW, you almost always find an amount of pain.
[03:23:33.898 --> 03:23:41.525]  And the problem is that they learned how to deal with the pain by lying about it, by avoiding it.
[03:23:44.043 --> 03:23:53.730]  What they do is they initiate conflict, because they need to have conflict in order to feel anything.
[03:23:54.831 --> 03:24:03.396]  But then once they've initiated the conflict, then it starts to frighten them, and then they overreact.
[03:24:03.476 --> 03:24:04.657]  It's this constant brain cycle.
[03:24:09.466 --> 03:24:09.546]  No.
[03:24:30.847 --> 03:24:31.768]  People are interested in.
[03:24:32.609 --> 03:24:41.439]  They should actually read the second book, which is SJWs Always Double Down, because it gets into why SJWs behave the way that they do.
[03:24:41.879 --> 03:24:50.329]  SJWs Always Lie is about what you should do when you come under attack at your office, at your church, wherever.
[03:24:51.119 --> 03:24:53.360]  Um, it's basically a survival guide.
[03:24:53.600 --> 03:24:56.082]  Okay, you know, if you're getting attacked, this is what you should do.
[03:24:56.482 --> 03:24:58.223]  In the case of SJWs, always double down.
[03:24:58.623 --> 03:25:02.545]  It's an attempt to understand why they behave the way they do.
[03:25:02.925 --> 03:25:09.029]  And if you look at, um, you know, anonymous conservatives, RK theory is one element of it.
[03:25:09.649 --> 03:25:12.411]  Well, I mean, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again.
[03:25:12.431 --> 03:25:13.231]  That's what I've noticed.
[03:25:13.691 --> 03:25:15.012]  They do always double down.
[03:25:15.052 --> 03:25:16.313]  And they're very OCD.
[03:25:16.353 --> 03:25:17.593]  They're very pathological.
[03:25:17.854 --> 03:25:19.955]  And that's why they think everybody else is mentally ill.
[03:25:21.085 --> 03:25:27.029]  And absolutely, they kind of gave in to bad things, decided to mentally ill, not challenge it and just twist their minds.
[03:25:27.049 --> 03:25:28.250]  They never overcame.
[03:25:28.671 --> 03:25:36.076]  Like the definition of victory and competence and strength is adversity, which you then overcame, learning competence to greater levels of competence.
[03:25:36.396 --> 03:25:41.520]  With them, they always learned incompetence, so they didn't want to say everyone's a victim, have cry closets.
[03:25:42.381 --> 03:25:45.344]  People are weaker than them, so they can rule over the weak.
[03:25:45.624 --> 03:25:51.431]  They want to make everybody weaker as a coping strategy, while subconsciously trying to become the tyrants that oppress them.
[03:25:51.771 --> 03:25:55.175]  So they become the super tyrant that they fear, which they don't even know they are.
[03:25:56.476 --> 03:25:57.457]  Well, that's exactly right.
[03:25:57.517 --> 03:26:04.622]  That's why you're always seeing the SJW women trying to convince other women to make themselves look less attractive.
[03:26:05.843 --> 03:26:17.672]  To tie this back to Jordan Peterson, I believe very strongly that Jordan Peterson, because he's a very intelligent version of this mentality, this mindset,
[03:26:18.462 --> 03:26:25.165]  He actually took his delusion bubble and constructed an entire philosophical system around it.
[03:26:25.645 --> 03:26:27.386]  And that's what the Maps of Meaning is.
[03:26:27.406 --> 03:26:36.010]  The Maps of Meaning is essentially his way of creating a huge defensive system to protect his psyche.
[03:26:36.931 --> 03:26:41.913]  And the lesser SJWs, they don't have that intellectual capacity, so they just
[03:26:42.802 --> 03:26:43.202]  Why?
[03:26:43.622 --> 03:26:47.884]  They just tell you that black is white when everyone can look and see that it's white.
[03:26:47.904 --> 03:26:55.667]  Sure, he's just building a cosmology that then his delusion can fit into, which shows he's kind of at a brain bug level, you know, in a caste level.
[03:26:56.047 --> 03:26:57.388]  And I'm not trying to be mean to Peter.
[03:26:57.428 --> 03:26:59.208]  Some of what he says is, you know, true, and he's an articulate guy.
[03:26:59.228 --> 03:27:03.270]  But if you look in his eyes, he's not trying to look completely insane.
[03:27:03.650 --> 03:27:05.451]  I mean, he does look seriously sick.
[03:27:07.165 --> 03:27:14.133]  Well, I think that, you know, when I watch the way that he talks, I can even tell when he's about to lie.
[03:27:14.954 --> 03:27:20.561]  He has two tells that he has repeatedly in his videos.
[03:27:21.242 --> 03:27:27.089]  And when he's going to lie, going to lie, he'll always repeat something twice.
[03:27:27.802 --> 03:27:28.282]  Well, wait, wait, wait.
[03:27:46.872 --> 03:27:47.152]  I agree.
[03:27:47.212 --> 03:27:51.274]  I think he thinks he's telling the truth because I've seen him and I started watching him more to understand it.
[03:27:51.754 --> 03:27:53.895]  He even talked about he got asked questions he doesn't like.
[03:27:54.235 --> 03:27:55.595]  He says, I won't answer it.
[03:27:55.635 --> 03:27:58.056]  He said, then a week later, I wrote a column.
[03:27:58.116 --> 03:28:01.998]  So he has to, when he gets hit with something uncomfortable, there's nothing really there.
[03:28:02.038 --> 03:28:05.519]  He has to develop a new, a new track for that.
[03:28:07.409 --> 03:28:10.332]  Yeah, and he also likes to, he's also delaying time.
[03:28:10.392 --> 03:28:11.613]  He's trying to buy time.
[03:28:12.453 --> 03:28:26.126]  But the key thing is, with Jordan Peterson and with Ben Shapiro and with all other charlatans, the way that you can always identify them is the way that they redefine simple, commonly understood words.
[03:28:26.346 --> 03:28:28.768]  Mother and father become GZ, exactly.
[03:28:30.083 --> 03:28:35.647]  Yeah, it is a very, very reliable tell, and whenever you see someone doing that, dig a little deeper.
[03:28:35.787 --> 03:28:41.972]  Well, as you said, nationalism, patriotism, populism, Christianity, the real Christianity is coming back.
[03:28:42.212 --> 03:28:43.933]  Vox Day, always love reading your articles.
[03:28:43.993 --> 03:28:45.695]  My God, how did I miss getting you on the air?
[03:28:45.715 --> 03:28:46.975]  Please come back anytime you want.
[03:28:47.536 --> 03:28:50.678]  Great job with all the work you're doing, and we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[03:28:50.838 --> 03:28:56.002]  That's Vox, Vox University, Vox, I'm saying it wrong, voxversity.com.
[03:28:56.282 --> 03:28:56.863]  We'll be back.
[03:28:57.003 --> 03:28:57.723]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:28:57.743 --> 03:28:58.184]  Stay with us.
[03:29:02.159 --> 03:29:03.921]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:30:03.342 --> 03:30:03.782]  Good morning.
[03:30:04.263 --> 03:30:05.344]  My name is Andrew Grossman.
[03:30:05.744 --> 03:30:07.686]  I'm a partner at the law firm Baker Hostetler.
[03:30:07.826 --> 03:30:11.669]  I represent Alex and InfoWars in the lawsuit that was filed by Brendan Gilmore.
[03:30:11.949 --> 03:30:25.921]  This morning, we asked the District Court to dismiss Mr. Gilmore's lawsuit, to require Mr. Gilmore to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding to his lawsuit, and to sanction Mr. Gilmore for using a federal court to wage a publicity stunt.
[03:30:26.301 --> 03:30:27.542]  Now let me be clear about this.
[03:30:27.943 --> 03:30:31.646]  Mr. Gilmour's claims against Alex Jones and Infowars are legally defective.
[03:30:31.886 --> 03:30:35.169]  We are confident that the suit will be thrown out of court.
[03:30:35.569 --> 03:30:39.192]  But make no mistake, vexatious lawsuits like this one are dangerous.
[03:30:39.913 --> 03:30:42.535]  Because they seek to chip away at our cherished First Amendment rights.
[03:30:42.995 --> 03:30:46.598]  The First Amendment gives all Americans the right to have their say on today's news.
[03:30:47.039 --> 03:30:56.246]  Alex Jones thought it was strange that Mr. Gilmour was popping up in all the media coverage on the events in Charlottesville, with what seemed like the same anti-Trump talking points every time.
[03:30:56.367 --> 03:30:58.849]  And that is exactly what Mr. Jones questioned.
[03:30:59.249 --> 03:31:04.353]  Was the media, with Mr. Gilmour's eager assistance, spinning the story against President Trump?
[03:31:05.174 --> 03:31:13.396]  That is the kind of probing question that every cable news analyst, every columnist, and every American who cares about what's going on in this country asks every day.
[03:31:13.996 --> 03:31:17.737]  They try to make sense of what they see reported in the news, and then they say what they think.
[03:31:18.238 --> 03:31:20.898]  The First Amendment absolutely protects that speech.
[03:31:21.298 --> 03:31:22.679]  Now, Mr. Gilmour disagrees.
[03:31:23.299 --> 03:31:26.560]  He obviously opposes Alex Jones's political viewpoint.
[03:31:27.100 --> 03:31:32.305]  He says that InfoWars is not what he considers to be responsible journalism and that it can therefore be suppressed.
[03:31:32.965 --> 03:31:39.270]  His lawyers say that the law should distinguish between speech that informs the public and speech that they think misinforms the public.
[03:31:39.711 --> 03:31:45.396]  But the whole point of the First Amendment is that people like Mr. Gilmour and his lawyers do not
[03:31:45.956 --> 03:31:48.897]  Get to decide whether their political opponents are allowed to have a voice.
[03:31:49.477 --> 03:31:53.079]  They do not get to decide what the public is allowed to hear.
[03:31:53.619 --> 03:32:00.001]  That fundamental misunderstanding of our First Amendment rights is just one of the reasons that Mr. Gilmour's suit has to be thrown out.
[03:32:00.322 --> 03:32:08.585]  As a matter of principle, no one should be able to drag their political opponents into court as a publicity stunt to harass them for their protected speech.
[03:32:09.145 --> 03:32:16.509]  That kind of abuse must have consequences, so that when people like Mr. Gilmour are thinking about filing suit, they think first before they do so.
[03:32:16.970 --> 03:32:24.094]  And that's why we're asking the court to find that Mr. Gilmour's lawsuit is what the law calls a strategic lawsuit against public participation.
[03:32:24.114 --> 03:32:30.978]  If the court agrees, Mr. Gilmour will be required to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding.
[03:32:31.898 --> 03:32:34.359]  And we'll be subject to additional monetary sanctions.
[03:32:35.019 --> 03:32:37.359]  Mr. Gilmour brought these consequences on himself.
[03:32:37.900 --> 03:32:42.661]  He left it the chance to file a lawsuit instead of exercising his own First Amendment rights to talk back.
[03:32:43.381 --> 03:32:56.384]  We can only hope that he will come to understand the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' words that when it comes to fighting perceived falsehoods and fallacies, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.
[03:32:56.964 --> 03:32:58.505]  And with that, I'll turn it back to Alex.
[03:32:58.705 --> 03:32:59.005]  Thank you.
[03:33:05.992 --> 03:33:08.621]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.051 --> 03:33:28.796]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:29.376 --> 03:33:31.398]  And by the way, Matt Bracken hosts an hour a week.
[03:33:31.419 --> 03:33:32.500]  Does an incredible job.
[03:33:32.520 --> 03:33:33.621]  I want to get him back on this week.
[03:33:33.661 --> 03:33:37.525]  He was happy to have Vox go a little bit longer, so I went longer because he likes Vox as well.
[03:33:38.245 --> 03:33:39.266]  And listen, here's the deal.
[03:33:39.346 --> 03:33:39.907]  I'm a Christian.
[03:33:39.987 --> 03:33:40.568]  I love God.
[03:33:40.688 --> 03:33:42.349]  I don't sit there and say I'm the perfect guy.
[03:33:42.370 --> 03:33:46.574]  Like these glitter bug preachers where it's all about a contest about how holy you are.
[03:33:48.154 --> 03:33:54.479]  The globalists have taken over the churches because they fear God, they fear Jesus Christ, they fear that spirit, and they want to overthrow it.
[03:33:54.559 --> 03:33:59.544]  So, praying, calling on God, they can't stand it, folks.
[03:33:59.644 --> 03:34:00.825]  It's an evil force.
[03:34:00.925 --> 03:34:01.405]  It's real.
[03:34:02.606 --> 03:34:03.507]  That's what we're up against.
[03:34:03.527 --> 03:34:04.448]  This stuff's real.
[03:34:04.808 --> 03:34:05.709]  They're into the occult.
[03:34:06.209 --> 03:34:09.052]  The left in every study, even their own studies, is evil.
[03:34:11.963 --> 03:34:17.207]  So, let's play Melania Trump since she's done this big bill, you know, for the kids and all the rest of it today.
[03:34:17.227 --> 03:34:22.151]  I thought I'd play what they hate, her spontaneously with the Lord's Prayer, then we'll hand the baton to Matt Bracken.
[03:34:22.172 --> 03:34:22.492]  Here it is.
[03:34:23.973 --> 03:34:24.994]  Let us pray.
[03:34:26.455 --> 03:34:30.939]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name.
[03:34:31.699 --> 03:34:37.044]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[03:34:38.118 --> 03:35:00.538]  Give us these days our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever amen
[03:35:03.496 --> 03:35:04.497]  Not devil worshippers.
[03:35:04.897 --> 03:35:05.658]  That's what they don't like.
[03:35:05.678 --> 03:35:07.900]  We're going to Matt Bracken here in about 60 seconds, just briefly.
[03:35:07.920 --> 03:35:10.402]  I only plug about once an hour.
[03:35:10.562 --> 03:35:11.623]  You're the folks that fund us.
[03:35:11.743 --> 03:35:13.264]  We try to make it easy with great products.
[03:35:13.725 --> 03:35:15.706]  The big special right now we haven't had since Christmas.
[03:35:16.327 --> 03:35:21.651]  50% off on Super Blue, colloidal silver fortified, and iodine fortified fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:35:21.671 --> 03:35:23.693]  We have it for children as well.
[03:35:24.274 --> 03:35:24.474]  50% off.
[03:35:24.754 --> 03:35:25.755]  That's unprecedented.
[03:35:27.165 --> 03:35:29.527]  At this price, we're going to sell a lot of it that's under operation.
[03:35:29.547 --> 03:35:33.509]  We also have the immune gargle in three different sizes and the mouthwash.
[03:35:34.050 --> 03:35:40.594]  All of it 50% off in one big package deal with free shipping on top of it or individually 50% off.
[03:35:42.175 --> 03:35:44.957]  We also have DNA Force back in after almost six months.
[03:35:45.577 --> 03:35:47.518]  DNA Force Plus, an incredible product.
[03:35:48.099 --> 03:35:48.279]  50% off.
[03:35:48.339 --> 03:35:49.460]  That special is going to end soon.
[03:35:50.782 --> 03:35:53.826]  Bodies, the ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcumin level.
[03:35:54.426 --> 03:35:55.608]  It's 25% off.
[03:35:55.708 --> 03:35:56.989]  Rainforest, 25% off.
[03:35:57.430 --> 03:36:00.914]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:36:00.954 --> 03:36:05.099]  And we're going to sell out in the next few weeks of at least the adult toothpaste.
[03:36:05.119 --> 03:36:06.280]  People say, well, then why are you doing the special?
[03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:08.863]  Because we know that new people have never tried it.
[03:36:09.003 --> 03:36:09.764]  Order it when it's 50% off.
[03:36:10.825 --> 03:36:11.986]  And then they ordered over and over again.
[03:36:12.006 --> 03:36:12.867]  We can find our operation.
[03:36:13.107 --> 03:36:18.210]  We're growing our amount of customers with these lost leaders because you find out how good it is.
[03:36:18.811 --> 03:36:21.813]  We believe it's one of the best toothpastes out there, and our listeners certainly agree.
[03:36:21.853 --> 03:36:25.435]  Okay, for the next 25 minutes, Matt Bracken takes over.
[03:36:25.475 --> 03:36:27.917]  Really appreciate him and the fine work he's doing.
[03:36:27.937 --> 03:36:28.838]  He's got a lot to cover.
[03:36:29.098 --> 03:36:30.199]  I've been asked the question all day.
[03:36:30.219 --> 03:36:33.061]  I'm going to punch you out, but I want to get this answer from you and then your own agenda.
[03:36:33.641 --> 03:36:39.004]  With the wheels coming off, three federal judges saying Mueller's a liar, a fraud, wants to impeach Trump, caught lying.
[03:36:39.584 --> 03:36:40.445]  What are they going to do?
[03:36:40.685 --> 03:36:41.845]  I think they're going to strike back.
[03:36:42.105 --> 03:36:43.646]  How are they going to strike back, Matt Bracken?
[03:36:45.247 --> 03:36:51.010]  Well, one way might be an attack, some kind of a terrorist attack.
[03:36:52.431 --> 03:36:59.775]  If they are monitoring somebody, the FBI might conveniently drop the ball again, as seems to happen over and over again.
[03:36:59.795 --> 03:37:01.976]  I don't see Mueller
[03:37:03.027 --> 03:37:05.869]  So just quitting writing an exoneration.
[03:37:06.409 --> 03:37:10.312]  He might though claim out of his high sense of altruism.
[03:37:10.372 --> 03:37:27.704]  He's going to go dark for the rest of the period through the midterms while he is really just sort of turning the lights out but without telling anybody and then after the midterms perhaps then there will be some kind of a final report.
[03:37:29.349 --> 03:37:33.170]  If they had anything, it would have already been leaked in the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:34.671]  They don't have anything.
[03:37:34.731 --> 03:37:37.732]  It's been a terrible week for Team Mueller, thank goodness.
[03:37:38.432 --> 03:37:43.874]  And I expect that the IG report is going to come down like a ton of bricks.
[03:37:44.434 --> 03:37:47.275]  I've been following, I would say, Conservative Treehouse.
[03:37:47.835 --> 03:37:54.777]  They're staying with—Sundance over there is staying with a theory that Sessions isn't just lobotomized or blackmailed.
[03:37:55.430 --> 03:38:03.355]  That he's actually sincerely working with Horowitz at the IG and with Huber, this outside prosecutor.
[03:38:04.182 --> 03:38:06.704]  And that they're already working up indictments.
[03:38:07.245 --> 03:38:11.028]  And after the IG report drops, it was supposed to drop this week.
[03:38:11.608 --> 03:38:21.936]  I think that they said that they're delaying it for up to two weeks because they're working more Comey information into it that Comey has been putting out on his own.
[03:38:22.917 --> 03:38:25.659]  But it will be great if these indictments do drop.
[03:38:25.760 --> 03:38:26.680]  I won't hold my breath.
[03:38:27.261 --> 03:38:29.783]  Clearly, there's a titanic battle at work right now.
[03:38:31.445 --> 03:38:46.212]  Admiral Mike Rogers, who really saved the nation, saved the Republic, when he went to Trump Tower and told Donald Trump that he was being effectively wiretapped, he's now retired.
[03:38:46.252 --> 03:38:47.513]  He'll be free to testify.
[03:38:48.237 --> 03:39:04.210]  So we might be setting up a clash of the titans with Mike Rogers competing in congressional testimony against the lying traitors and coup plotters who would be Clapper, Comey and Brennan, among many others.
[03:39:04.810 --> 03:39:10.295]  But, you know, we are in for an epic spring, spring and summer, that's for sure.
[03:39:13.126 --> 03:39:16.308]  Yeah, anyway, I was watching Vox Dei.
[03:39:16.328 --> 03:39:17.389]  I've never seen him before.
[03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:18.169]  I've been reading him.
[03:39:18.429 --> 03:39:23.573]  I've seen a few little YouTube clips here and there, but I didn't really know who he was.
[03:39:23.653 --> 03:39:26.195]  But it's really informative.
[03:39:26.895 --> 03:39:30.838]  It's what I've been thinking about all along the last couple of weeks also.
[03:39:32.038 --> 03:39:39.143]  Just this weekend, we saw the EU, the European Union, accepted a giant statue of Karl Marx.
[03:39:39.989 --> 03:39:47.415]  They don't seem in any way ashamed of the 100 million that were killed by Marx's theories in the 20th century.
[03:39:48.115 --> 03:39:56.341]  So the junkers of the EU, he's actually defending socialism, just saying, don't worry, we'll get it right the next time.
[03:39:57.082 --> 03:40:08.751]  But the people aren't buying it, which is why they're trying in Europe to replace the native Europeans and the nation states with third world migrants.
[03:40:09.437 --> 03:40:19.432]  This is called the Great Replacement, which I call a code word or politically correct term for genocide of the Europeans.
[03:40:20.633 --> 03:40:25.761]  If the Europeans aren't going to accept socialism, part two or part three,
[03:40:26.519 --> 03:40:35.766]  Then they're just going to replace the Europeans with a very low IQ crowd of third worlders who they see as guaranteed welfare votes.
[03:40:36.367 --> 03:40:46.495]  This is how the elites plan to stay in power and essentially turn Europe and eventually the entire world into a globalist serfdom with the elites in charge.
[03:40:47.225 --> 03:40:51.446]  This is why they de-platform people in Europe like Tommy Robinson.
[03:40:51.946 --> 03:40:57.647]  This is why they wouldn't let Brittany Pettibone or Lauren Southern into the UK to speak.
[03:40:58.847 --> 03:41:02.548]  This is also why Alfie Evans had to die.
[03:41:03.128 --> 03:41:06.189]  You know, the state has to be seen as supreme.
[03:41:06.209 --> 03:41:09.650]  This is just what Vox Dei was saying past half hour.
[03:41:10.970 --> 03:41:16.191]  The nation, the state, the overarching state is the replacement for God.
[03:41:16.963 --> 03:41:25.947]  And even a baby can't be taken out of the country, even if it's a hopeless or medically improbable attempt to save his life.
[03:41:26.608 --> 03:41:28.909]  The state had to crush that baby.
[03:41:29.309 --> 03:41:34.031]  He had to die in that British hospital under the state's National Health Service.
[03:41:34.551 --> 03:41:36.172]  That's why they had the police out front.
[03:41:36.752 --> 03:41:39.714]  So this is really the big issue that's going on.
[03:41:40.721 --> 03:41:46.066]  This population replacement, this genocide by other, you know, by another name.
[03:41:46.786 --> 03:41:57.916]  And if people aren't allowed to talk about this, you know, this is the going back to, for example, the whole Ben Shapiro versus Infowars kerfuffle last week.
[03:41:58.756 --> 03:42:05.522]  You know, Ben Shapiro goes on CNN and he appears, you know, grinning and yucking it up with Stelter and Lemon.
[03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:13.444]  Yet he has the gall to say that Candace and Kanye shouldn't come on InfoWars.
[03:42:14.064 --> 03:42:17.926]  This is exactly setting up the boundaries of what's acceptable.
[03:42:18.706 --> 03:42:32.713]  This is the GOP and the Democrats staying in the polite boundaries of acceptable speech and trying to deplatform InfoWars by every means possible.
[03:42:33.494 --> 03:42:35.775]  And that's why we have to defend InfoWars.
[03:42:36.849 --> 03:42:44.754]  That's also why we need to support other platforms like Gab and BitChute instead of, you know, YouTube, Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[03:42:44.774 --> 03:42:49.797]  Am I hearing this coming up?
[03:43:02.426 --> 03:43:04.726]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:43:04.766 --> 03:43:06.487]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:43:06.927 --> 03:43:09.808]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[03:45:14.979 --> 03:45:18.521]  Listen to all these incredible five star reviews from verified buyers.
[03:45:18.861 --> 03:45:21.963]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[03:45:22.223 --> 03:45:24.385]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin.
[03:45:24.645 --> 03:45:31.568]  And it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[03:45:31.708 --> 03:45:34.049]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[03:45:34.289 --> 03:45:35.970]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[03:45:36.170 --> 03:45:38.811]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible.
[03:45:39.071 --> 03:45:43.593]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time.
[03:45:43.913 --> 03:45:49.976]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[03:45:50.436 --> 03:45:54.960]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[03:45:55.440 --> 03:45:56.581]  That helps with focus, too.
[03:45:57.021 --> 03:45:58.002]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[03:45:58.503 --> 03:46:02.606]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[03:46:03.026 --> 03:46:07.069]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[03:46:07.350 --> 03:46:08.891]  There's definitely been a change.
[03:46:09.151 --> 03:46:09.792]  For the better.
[03:46:10.232 --> 03:46:13.995]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[03:46:14.415 --> 03:46:16.076]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[03:46:16.497 --> 03:46:17.378]  I hope this lasts.
[03:46:18.218 --> 03:46:20.279]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[03:46:20.559 --> 03:46:26.681]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes, I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[03:46:26.981 --> 03:46:31.903]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[03:46:32.383 --> 03:46:35.664]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[03:46:36.284 --> 03:46:41.348]  Taking one capsule a day in the a.m., and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[03:46:41.869 --> 03:46:43.690]  I'd feel exhausted after 8 p.m.
[03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:44.471]  Not anymore.
[03:46:44.871 --> 03:46:46.052]  Seem to be sleeping better, too.
[03:46:46.632 --> 03:46:48.454]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[03:46:48.694 --> 03:46:50.075]  I will definitely buy this again.
[03:46:50.876 --> 03:46:54.199]  Head to infowarrestore.com and experience Alpha Power today.

[03:47:05.538 --> 03:47:11.741]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.922 --> 03:47:15.142]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:15.243 --> 03:47:20.025]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:35.390 --> 03:47:36.010]  Hey, I'm back.
[03:47:36.791 --> 03:47:38.111]  Yeah, this was a great segment.
[03:47:38.211 --> 03:47:48.536]  It's short, but following Vox Day is a challenge, but also a lot of fertile information and great ideas to expand on.
[03:47:49.276 --> 03:47:52.958]  Something that he mentioned was, SJWs always lie.
[03:47:53.758 --> 03:47:56.079]  Social justice warriors always lie.
[03:47:56.619 --> 03:47:57.280]  Why is that?
[03:47:57.980 --> 03:48:02.442]  Well, both in Marxism and in Islamism,
[03:48:03.906 --> 03:48:09.807]  Adherents are told, don't think about how it's going to work, just obey the rules.
[03:48:10.948 --> 03:48:13.568]  Smarter people than you have figured all of this out.
[03:48:14.189 --> 03:48:16.929]  In the case of the Quran, it's Allah and Muhammad.
[03:48:17.529 --> 03:48:20.750]  And in the case of socialism, it's Marx and Lenin.
[03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:23.731]  And you just need to be a good soldier.
[03:48:24.331 --> 03:48:28.352]  This is why SJWs don't have a problem with cognitive dissonance.
[03:48:29.145 --> 03:48:32.967]  It's obvious after more than a century that socialism doesn't work.
[03:48:33.067 --> 03:48:34.187]  It hasn't worked anywhere.
[03:48:34.207 --> 03:48:39.910]  The more socialist the country becomes, the poorer and less free it becomes.
[03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:45.893]  But it still appeals to people with low educations and low IQs.
[03:48:47.114 --> 03:48:58.443]  This is why our elites want to flood both America and Europe with low IQ migrants, because they'll be easy fodder for leading them to socialism.
[03:48:59.023 --> 03:49:02.426]  Or if they're already Muslims, then they're just, they're already fodder.
[03:49:02.886 --> 03:49:08.271]  They're self-identified volunteers, unless they were born into it, which I guess most of them were.
[03:49:08.951 --> 03:49:12.414]  But both, both in Islam and in socialism,
[03:49:13.280 --> 03:49:20.927]  Both of these faiths, which they really are, socialism is absolutely a religion, it's a godless religion, but it's a faith.
[03:49:21.968 --> 03:49:27.934]  Both of them believe in what I call taqiyya, and for liberals it's liberal taqiyya.
[03:49:28.604 --> 03:49:36.151]  Which means that anything that you do to further the advance of socialism or Islam is good inherently.
[03:49:36.712 --> 03:49:37.993]  So you're allowed to lie.
[03:49:38.013 --> 03:49:40.315]  You should lie.
[03:49:40.455 --> 03:49:42.076]  You should lie about your intentions.
[03:49:42.117 --> 03:49:43.578]  You should lie about your methods.
[03:49:44.279 --> 03:49:45.820]  And it's very effective.
[03:49:46.701 --> 03:49:54.328]  The most important book that I've read probably in the last five years that I can even think of, nothing comes close,
[03:49:55.251 --> 03:49:57.612]  It's a few years old, and somehow I missed it.
[03:49:57.672 --> 03:49:59.953]  I read some of the reviews, but I didn't read it.
[03:50:00.733 --> 03:50:04.315]  It's called American Betrayal by Diana West.
[03:50:05.175 --> 03:50:15.059]  And it goes back to the beginning of the 20th century and shows how our country was really taken over from within, particularly during the Roosevelt administration.
[03:50:15.840 --> 03:50:16.500]  And that was when
[03:50:17.636 --> 03:50:20.398]  Roosevelt was surrounded by true Stalinists.
[03:50:20.518 --> 03:50:23.341]  It turned out later they were communists.
[03:50:23.361 --> 03:50:37.511]  They were Stalinist Soviet agents and they worked all the way through the New Deal to make America as socialistic as they could and in every chance and in every way to help Stalin spread communism.
[03:50:38.272 --> 03:50:40.013]  This is, you know, beyond debate now.
[03:50:40.073 --> 03:50:43.596]  The book is, you know, is an academic work, heavily footnoted.
[03:50:44.536 --> 03:50:46.118]  At the time it was, you know, it was
[03:50:47.367 --> 03:50:53.332]  It was called, you know, discounted as McCarthyism, the fact that this country was taken over from within.
[03:50:54.033 --> 03:50:57.075]  But she identifies where America really went off the rails.
[03:50:57.936 --> 03:51:13.469]  In 1933 and 34, we knew what communism was doing, that millions were being purged and murdered, that the terror famine was happening in Ukraine, and our leaders decided it was worth it to hide this,
[03:51:14.173 --> 03:51:20.676]  Because they didn't want people to be so turned off against communism that they would also reject socialism.
[03:51:21.796 --> 03:51:30.360]  Roosevelt and his people, and really continuing decade by decade until today, they believe in something called the Great Convergence.
[03:51:31.081 --> 03:51:43.912]  We'll take the best parts of capitalism and the best parts of communism and we'll merge somewhere in a socialist form of government run by socialist elites.
[03:51:44.753 --> 03:51:46.174]  And it's been very successful.
[03:51:46.194 --> 03:51:49.237]  I mean, just look at our universities today.
[03:51:49.918 --> 03:51:51.579]  It's been completely successful.
[03:51:52.440 --> 03:51:56.483]  Antonio Gramsci was an Italian communist in the early 20th century.
[03:51:57.791 --> 03:52:02.792]  He didn't believe that Lenin and Stalin were going to succeed with, you know, brutal, invasive tactics.
[03:52:03.552 --> 03:52:10.273]  He believed in rotting the institutions from within and taking over every institution.
[03:52:10.353 --> 03:52:13.214]  It's called the Long March Through the Institutions.
[03:52:13.774 --> 03:52:15.254]  And it's been highly successful.
[03:52:15.894 --> 03:52:18.895]  All you have to do is look at not only academia.
[03:52:19.495 --> 03:52:21.635]  Our corporations are politically correct now.
[03:52:22.255 --> 03:52:25.036]  Institutions like the Boy Scouts, politically correct.
[03:52:25.666 --> 03:52:28.087]  We're really fighting a rearguard action now.
[03:52:28.887 --> 03:52:30.668]  And Vox Dei was completely right.
[03:52:31.268 --> 03:52:51.396]  We need to support nationalist leaders who are trying to preserve and conserve our own cultures and identities to keep us from just being submerged beneath this, you know, this great replacement where we're going to wind up as serfs in this global New World Order.
[03:52:52.197 --> 03:52:52.837]  It's happening.
[03:52:53.533 --> 03:53:05.077]  And unfortunately, even among conservatives, we find ourselves deplatformed because we're not staying within the polite boundaries of acceptable speech.
[03:53:05.818 --> 03:53:13.901]  And talking about the Great Replacement or genocide of Europeans and Americans, it's not considered acceptable.
[03:53:14.661 --> 03:53:22.644]  We're supposed to, like Jordan Peterson said, take our pills and stay within the acceptable mainstream, be polite,
[03:53:23.211 --> 03:53:29.475]  Well, the problem is, being polite keeps us on the fast track toward oblivion.
[03:53:29.995 --> 03:53:31.916]  We are being eradicated.
[03:53:32.697 --> 03:53:42.983]  I often ask the question, is it still called genocide if you're brainwashed into hating your own people before you're replaced and wiped out?
[03:53:44.564 --> 03:53:50.528]  If the people being eradicated, for example in Sweden, if the people being replaced and eradicated
[03:53:51.175 --> 03:53:53.076]  Are first made to hate themselves.
[03:53:53.636 --> 03:53:55.636]  Does it still count as eradication?
[03:53:56.457 --> 03:54:14.222]  The one thing that I've learned in my life is that brainwashing absolutely works and we need to resist this brainwashing and we need to resist deplatforming people and other voices outside of the of the acceptable mainstream because
[03:54:15.035 --> 03:54:25.842]  If we don't, we are going to find ourselves on the last boxcar or in some kind of a zoo, because we are being wiped out.
[03:54:26.383 --> 03:54:29.825]  Our values, our culture, our peoples, our nations.
[03:54:31.406 --> 03:54:32.887]  The communists never quit.
[03:54:33.448 --> 03:54:35.589]  The socialists, they didn't surrender.
[03:54:36.089 --> 03:54:44.095]  We think we won the Cold War, but in effect, the communists got inside of our own system and turned us into pod people.
[03:54:44.716 --> 03:54:53.061]  We're now like replicant communists, spouting communist slogans, even while we hold up, you know, our pocket constitutions.
[03:54:53.801 --> 03:54:56.142]  It's really been an amazing thing to watch.
[03:54:56.863 --> 03:55:09.970]  And I can only encourage people, please read Diana West's book, The American Betrayal, because it's nailed it closer than anything else that I've ever seen.
[03:55:10.789 --> 03:55:21.778]  And we are going to lose this war if we continue to play by the, you know, the Marquis de Queensberry rules against people who are liars and cutthroats.
[03:55:22.618 --> 03:55:29.884]  I mean, this has gone to the extent that even our religious institutions have been taken over by Marxists.
[03:55:30.404 --> 03:55:36.629]  There's no doubt in my mind this is what happened to my own church with the Pope.
[03:55:37.242 --> 03:55:42.687]  The previous Pope wasn't ill, he wasn't old, he didn't have dementia.
[03:55:43.488 --> 03:55:49.954]  He was forced out in a putsch by cardinals who were themselves covert socialists.
[03:55:50.995 --> 03:55:56.119]  So the tide is against us and the time for being polite is over.
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:56:02.325]  Most of the conservatives within what I call, what folks call conservatism, Inc.,
[03:56:03.416 --> 03:56:05.618]  They really don't care if we lose this war.
[03:56:06.219 --> 03:56:09.422]  All they care about is being invited on CNN next week.
[03:56:10.042 --> 03:56:23.455]  And to do that, they have to stay within the acceptable boundaries, not talk about the things that I've been talking about the last 10 minutes, because that's a sure way to be branded as alt-right, outside acceptable bounds.
[03:56:24.321 --> 03:56:25.361]  Well, we can't do that.
[03:56:25.901 --> 03:56:28.522]  We need to call traitors what they are.
[03:56:28.682 --> 03:56:29.142]  Traitors.
[03:56:29.622 --> 03:56:30.723]  Stop being polite.
[03:56:31.243 --> 03:56:38.845]  Stop worrying about whether National Review will publish you, or whether these other for-profit Conservativism Inc.
[03:56:39.265 --> 03:56:41.345]  websites will publish your columns.
[03:56:41.865 --> 03:56:42.426]  Forget it.
[03:56:42.866 --> 03:56:43.986]  Go outside of them.
[03:56:44.728 --> 03:56:56.592]  Appeal to people to go to places like InfoWars to use free video sites like BitChute or Gab instead of Twitter and Facebook.
[03:56:57.233 --> 03:57:06.816]  As long as we're stuck using Twitter and Facebook, we're basically self-segregated to the back of the bus, but we're stepping fetches
[03:57:08.076 --> 03:57:11.278]  Ideologically, to the extent that we like the bus.
[03:57:11.358 --> 03:57:12.759]  It's a really nice bus.
[03:57:13.299 --> 03:57:18.422]  So we'll accept being throttled and shadow banned and pushed to the back of the bus.
[03:57:19.262 --> 03:57:29.147]  I say we need to support other avenues of thought, like Gab, like BitChute, like InfoWars, so that we can continue to reach people.
[03:57:29.708 --> 03:57:35.991]  We're never going to reach people as long as we're just using things like Twitter, where if you
[03:57:37.152 --> 03:57:40.353]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[03:57:40.393 --> 03:57:43.214]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[03:57:43.254 --> 03:57:44.474]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[03:58:04.781 --> 03:58:08.305]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
