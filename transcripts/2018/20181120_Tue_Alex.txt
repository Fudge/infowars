[00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:13.703]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:22.345]  Damn, that Norse beat and chant really gives me confidence.
[00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:22.885]  What about you?
[00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:24.806]  It's riding on the page.
[00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:32.598]  Discovering the new world.
[00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.801]  Conquering Gaul and then the UK.
[00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:37.041]  Founding Russia.
[00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:38.222]  Big.
[00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:40.604]  Ships with dragon heads.
[00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:42.806]  Riding the waves.
[00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.795]  Well, it is the 20th day of November 2018 on this Tuesday Global Transmission.
[00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:57.985]  And we have had parts of the U.S.
[00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:09.248]  border in Mexico and other areas closed down because Intel shows thousands are preparing, even as we speak, any time to try to bum rush U.S.
[00:01:09.288 --> 00:01:11.269]  security forces and smash the border.
[00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:14.930]  But they've got an even bigger problem.
[00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:18.051]  Say what you want about Mexico.
[00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:20.592]  A lot of great art, a lot of great culture.
[00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:22.213]  The people are not wimps.
[00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:23.053]  They're ready to fight.
[00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:27.887]  And they're also a lot of corruption, but they're at the top of the scale for third world countries.
[00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:35.310]  And they know that Honduras and Guatemala and then all the way down to South America, Venezuela collapsing is not a good idea.
[00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:46.854]  And when a bunch of military men come marching through using women as human shields, waving Venezuelan and Honduran flags and engaging in crime, the Mexicans have started beating the living snot out of them.
[00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:49.912]  Which is a normal response.
[00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:51.232]  I'm not even endorsing that.
[00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:52.173]  But the U.N.
[00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.913]  and others want to pull this crap.
[00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:55.294]  It's not going to go well.
[00:01:56.034 --> 00:02:00.456]  And the Mexicans in Tijuana and others are saying, we pay taxes.
[00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:06.419]  And we're going to have to put up tens of thousands of people here that are trying to go into the U.S.
[00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.159]  and get free crap?
[00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:08.520]  We're not doing this.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.361]  Because they understand it is literally
[00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:18.113]  Communists, socialists, criminals, you name it, have been organized into these UN camps and trained for this.
[00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:20.475]  So, good for the Mexicans.
[00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:22.457]  Because look, Mexicans are nationalists.
[00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:23.217]  And that's a good thing.
[00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:26.620]  If you don't have that, you don't have anything.
[00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:32.845]  Because these big multinational corporations are going to come in and they're going to eat your lunch.
[00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:34.166]  They don't pay taxes.
[00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:35.627]  They're above the law.
[00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:38.229]  And they're always telling you how you need to get rid of your country.
[00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.513]  Well, Mexicans know their country's not perfect and theirs is ours.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.982]  But, turning yourself into Venezuela when it's about 20 times worse?
[00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:59.385]  It's like saying we're going to turn all of America into Chicago, the worst parts of the South Side, or we're going to turn all of America into the worst areas of Detroit.
[00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:02.626]  It's not that all of Mexico is bad, it's that pockets of it are very bad.
[00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:12.009]  And Mexico sees a bunch of military-aged men ramming through their police, and they just go, you know, we're getting raped up the, you know what, the keister here.
[00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:15.633]  And you know, Trump and everybody else sees that as well.
[00:03:16.474 --> 00:03:18.315]  There's foreign multinational powers doing it.
[00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:20.596]  So, we're gonna be breaking that down.
[00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:25.579]  And then, a lot of times I'll see a theme going through the hundreds of news articles the crew prints for me.
[00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.682]  People always go, oh you troglodyte, you anti-technology guys, why do you print it?
[00:03:30.962 --> 00:03:34.084]  Because stories get changed, they get removed, computers don't load.
[00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:36.165]  We print everything we look at to have a record.
[00:03:37.312 --> 00:03:39.473]  And I've got huge storage facilities full of news articles.
[00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:41.174]  Because we have a record of these.
[00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:42.895]  So when they memory home, we can catch them.
[00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:58.764]  But today, a whole constellation, without me even looking for it, kind of like Connect the Dots came up, about atrazine in water all over the country, particularly Texas, that sterilizes you.
[00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:02.146]  That's out of the Texas Tribune, even the liberals get it.
[00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:04.467]  And that ties together with
[00:04:06.104 --> 00:04:09.846]  Pet pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females.
[00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:12.707]  That's a big report out of Berkeley.
[00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:16.588]  And that ties into the real agenda right here.
[00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.211]  Celine Dion has a new gender-bending clothing line for kids.
[00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:24.732]  And that ties into Whistleblower.
[00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:29.054]  Mentally retarded children being taught that they are another sex.
[00:04:29.954 --> 00:04:34.296]  All part of sterilizing them under eugenics.
[00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.023]  So first you fry their brains with the chemicals, the vaccines.
[00:04:40.123 --> 00:04:44.327]  Then you tell them how trendy it is to have their testicles chopped off.
[00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.494]  Our girls take melhormones so they don't ever go into estrus.
[00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:59.381]  I'm Alex Jones defending the human species because I'm a human and I think we're kind of cool.
[00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:09.019]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.840]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.500]  It's a good thing.
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.742]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:05:15.122 --> 00:05:17.463]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:05:17.503 --> 00:05:18.644]  I learned what the best was.
[00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:24.027]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:24.687]  It's amazing.
[00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:27.270]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.138]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotsApply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:35.900]  He has a glut of them.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.242]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:43.407]  When it's discounted usually 200, it's 127!
[00:05:44.328 --> 00:05:48.091]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[00:05:48.472 --> 00:05:50.253]  So, they're gonna sell out very, very quickly.
[00:05:50.594 --> 00:05:52.836]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:53.456]  It's amazing.
[00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:59.261]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:14.375]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:16.875]  November 20th, 2018.
[00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:18.496]  It is Tuesday.
[00:06:20.137 --> 00:06:26.239]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:31.161]  Well, we've got a major, major emergency gay frog alert.
[00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:33.171]  That's right.
[00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:38.494]  Turns out the gay bomb chemical is in almost all Texas water supply.
[00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:42.776]  And hey, I know like David Hogg said that's a really cool effect.
[00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:43.557]  Okay, fine.
[00:06:44.317 --> 00:06:45.478]  But no more humans?
[00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.219]  Well, that's a problem.
[00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:52.221]  And it's even in the Liberal Texas Tribune and Berkeley's reporting on it.
[00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:58.604]  So there's nothing more homophobic than Texas Tribune and your gay frog alma mater, Berkeley.
[00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.166]  So we're going to be going over those huge developments because
[00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.851]  I saw a pattern in the news today, so I want to open up with this.
[00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:06.832]  We've got all this other big, huge news.
[00:07:07.172 --> 00:07:08.252]  They've closed some of the U.S.
[00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:15.275]  border checkpoints in California because the U.N.-funded imaginary caravan is trying to slam through it right now.
[00:07:15.295 --> 00:07:16.135]  We're going to cover all that.
[00:07:16.155 --> 00:07:16.835]  The U.S.
[00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:21.277]  closes as busy as Mexico border crossing, as worried as they're about to try to take over.
[00:07:22.318 --> 00:07:22.818]  But here it is.
[00:07:23.874 --> 00:07:24.334]  Report!
[00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:28.896]  Toxic herbicide found in many Texas drinking water supplies.
[00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:34.878]  Nearly 500 water utilities across the state tested positive for Atrazine, a weed killer.
[00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:38.120]  And they found it at levels that, well, turn all the frogs gay.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.200]  Which can lead to harmful health effects.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.301]  Well, that's not harmful.
[00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:48.564]  Dying, being sterile, or being only attracted to the same sex, it just means no more frogs, which is kind of cool.
[00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:49.864]  I'm all for it.
[00:07:50.064 --> 00:08:01.231]  According to a new report, the Environmental Working Group also found that utilities are testing water during times when the herbicide isn't being used as much as they may be lowballing the results.
[00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.973]  Oh, you don't think they're lowballing the results?
[00:08:04.773 --> 00:08:08.876]  Because the same herbicides have been making the kids in France not have arms and legs.
[00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:09.216]  But hey!
[00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.231]  Too many people, right?
[00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:11.852]  It's liberal!
[00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:12.973]  It's liberal!
[00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:14.675]  You can't abort them in the womb!
[00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:19.079]  We're gonna handicap their ass real good here in the real world.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.063]  I'm very sorry for those children, but they have a real sick joke about it.
[00:08:23.717 --> 00:08:31.082]  So in 2015, Atrazine was found in water systems, this stuff always comes out four years later, serving nearly 30 million Americans in 27 states.
[00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:33.083]  According to a new report, Washington, D.C.
[00:08:33.123 --> 00:08:49.454]  based Environmental Working Group, Getty, also has photos of it, more than 10 million Texans have consumed drinking water with some level of Atrazine, a toxic herbicide with 472 water systems statewide testing positive and at least one detection according to a new report from the group.
[00:08:49.514 --> 00:08:50.835]  And they are definitely low balling that.
[00:08:51.335 --> 00:08:54.437]  Now, let's look at what old atrazine does.
[00:08:57.179 --> 00:09:10.329]  Pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females, and strangely enough, only causes them to be attracted to males, so the males then fertilize other males that are not producing eggs.
[00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.613]  But if you just tell the male he's really a female, well then, it's okay.
[00:09:17.494 --> 00:09:18.976]  Who wants to get in the way of this
[00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:21.051]  Love affair we've got.
[00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:22.855]  But don't be a gay frog in China.
[00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:23.857]  You'll get executed.
[00:09:24.738 --> 00:09:26.001]  But Apple owns slave factories.
[00:09:26.462 --> 00:09:27.524]  The guy that runs it's gay.
[00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:29.267]  They're killing gays.
[00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:31.211]  As long as he's gay, it's okay.
[00:09:32.378 --> 00:09:41.061]  So, Atrazine, one of the world's most widely used pesticides, wreaks havoc with the sex lives of adult male frogs, emasculating three-quarters of them.
[00:09:41.201 --> 00:09:42.361]  Well, that's okay.
[00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:47.623]  And turning one in ten to females, according to a new study by the University of California.
[00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:51.204]  But they don't actually produce eggs, but the males didn't want to have sex with them.
[00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:52.584]  And they go on.
[00:09:52.624 --> 00:10:00.287]  The professor who was hired to cover up said that it was actually the opposite, and it was, quote, turning the frogs gay.
[00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:03.130]  Which is cool, but they die.
[00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.770]  Super cool, but they die.
[00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:10.112]  No more gay frogs, no more straight frogs, just no more frogs.
[00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:15.014]  See, the targets are humans.
[00:10:15.454 --> 00:10:23.137]  They have a bunch of chemical additives and weed killers that don't do this, but this is the one that they specially came up with for you and your family.
[00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:25.518]  Oh, and then the White House science czar under Obama.
[00:10:25.898 --> 00:10:26.858]  The year I was born, 45 years ago,
[00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:39.627]  He wrote a big thousand-page book called Ecoscience, where he said, we'll develop herbicides, pesticides, and things that in the runoff, reduce fertility in humans.
[00:10:39.967 --> 00:10:40.067]  Oh.
[00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:41.148]  Hmm.
[00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:42.688]  You might want to actually go read it.
[00:10:42.748 --> 00:10:43.468]  It's free online.
[00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:45.029]  Oh, but it's okay.
[00:10:45.449 --> 00:10:49.910]  Celine Dion, she's so cool, has a new gender-neutral clothing line.
[00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.091]  Don't have kids in pink if they're girls, or blue if they're boys.
[00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:53.291]  No.
[00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:57.012]  They wear black like you wear at a funeral, because you're going to be sterilized.
[00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.833]  You're going to be dayed.
[00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:04.761]  So maybe we should play the ad for her new Seahag clothing line.
[00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:08.443]  It's officially called the Seahag Mother of Death clothing line.
[00:11:08.483 --> 00:11:09.403]  I'm being sarcastic there.
[00:11:09.723 --> 00:11:10.884]  Then we'll get to the really big news.
[00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:19.509]  Mentally retarded children and autistic children are being targeted and told you're really a boy or girl when you're not, so they can sterilize them.
[00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:24.992]  And the government's saying your seven-year-old autistic son has a right to have his testicles chopped off.
[00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:25.633]  Step aside.
[00:11:26.273 --> 00:11:27.153]  You're like, he's a minor.
[00:11:27.193 --> 00:11:27.794]  He's brain damaged.
[00:11:28.294 --> 00:11:29.615]  Step aside, racist.
[00:11:33.217 --> 00:11:36.399]  We're going to give you the chemicals... ...until your brain's gone.
[00:11:36.439 --> 00:11:38.861]  And then we're going to chop the other part off.
[00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:41.823]  Because the truth is, the genetics haven't been retarded.
[00:11:41.843 --> 00:11:44.725]  They can't let those genetics pass over.
[00:11:45.566 --> 00:11:46.907]  We must destroy the seed.
[00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.688]  We must destroy the child.
[00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:49.769]  It's liberal.
[00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:52.311]  So here's the old sea hag.
[00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:54.512]  Oh my God, there's no girls, there's no boys.
[00:11:55.213 --> 00:11:57.554]  Everything is death, everything is cool.
[00:11:57.814 --> 00:12:00.036]  Lucifer's got a plan, yeah.
[00:12:00.356 --> 00:12:02.498]  Planetary death, ah-ah, here it is.
[00:12:06.948 --> 00:12:10.309]  It's okay, it's okay.
[00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:12.069]  It's okay, you don't have a gender.
[00:12:12.129 --> 00:12:14.650]  One hour earlier.
[00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.951]  Girls in pink, boys in blue.
[00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:18.771]  Our children.
[00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:21.812]  They are not really our children.
[00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:27.113]  As we are all just links in a networked chain that is life.
[00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:28.353]  Those look like an ugly tranny.
[00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:30.574]  For us, they are everything.
[00:12:30.974 --> 00:12:31.394]  Everything.
[00:12:31.514 --> 00:12:35.035]  But in reality, we are only a fraction of their universe.
[00:12:35.975 --> 00:12:38.757]  Oh, they're going to open the universe up.
[00:12:38.777 --> 00:12:39.937]  She's going to sterilize them.
[00:12:40.497 --> 00:12:41.938]  Oh, it's so liberal!
[00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:42.678]  Atmosphere woman!
[00:12:42.698 --> 00:12:48.641]  When we thrust them forward into the future, the course will always be theirs to choose.
[00:12:48.841 --> 00:12:49.862]  Oh, theirs to choose.
[00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:50.582]  The chemicals.
[00:12:51.863 --> 00:12:54.424]  Oh, she's going to blow this nice black dust on you.
[00:12:55.245 --> 00:12:57.846]  Ah, the gift of Atmosphere.
[00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:00.007]  Oh, now you're black crosses.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.060]  Oh!
[00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:05.621]  Ah!
[00:13:07.903 --> 00:13:09.304]  Like they're wearing SS uniforms.
[00:13:11.466 --> 00:13:12.226]  She didn't do anything.
[00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:14.107]  She just came in and decided what your kids would be.
[00:13:14.528 --> 00:13:15.729]  I mean, oh, come on.
[00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:16.629]  I'm Celine Dion.
[00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:18.971]  I'm not spending the night in jail.
[00:13:19.531 --> 00:13:22.994]  Holy sh... I'm just a pervert messing with your kids.
[00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:24.435]  In your face.
[00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:26.992]  They're gonna choose their future.
[00:13:27.032 --> 00:13:27.772]  The state is.
[00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:29.233]  That's easy.
[00:13:29.773 --> 00:13:30.873]  I'm Celine Dion.
[00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:32.434]  Yeah girl, and I'm Beyonce.
[00:13:32.514 --> 00:13:34.115]  I'm Celine Dion and ugly fiag.
[00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.675]  I'm calling my agent.
[00:13:35.776 --> 00:13:36.956]  I'm calling my agent!
[00:13:38.977 --> 00:13:41.218]  And we can joke about it, but this is the plan.
[00:13:41.258 --> 00:13:42.659]  Now let's take you to the next level.
[00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:44.960]  22 page report.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.200]  Daily Mail.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.741]  Tabastock Institute runs it.
[00:13:48.021 --> 00:13:49.402]  The UK's the vanguard of this.
[00:13:50.322 --> 00:13:54.464]  Where in some classes, 30% of the children are transgender.
[00:13:55.814 --> 00:14:01.278]  And they go in to mentally retarded and autistic and tell them, you're a girl, you're a boy, vice versa, to totally jack.
[00:14:01.698 --> 00:14:07.202]  So they go, now you make the decision to have your testicles chopped off or girls to be given male hormones.
[00:14:07.562 --> 00:14:12.566]  And they go, mommy, daddy, they told me I have them chopped off!
[00:14:13.006 --> 00:14:13.967]  I'm a girl!
[00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:17.289]  And look, even, oh, here's your apple.
[00:14:17.929 --> 00:14:19.310]  But they're giving you the poison apple.
[00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:20.731]  Here's the apple.
[00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:24.234]  And you're like, well, it's liberal, so let's let them do it.
[00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:29.324]  Whistleblower teacher makes shocking claim that most are autistic.
[00:14:31.152 --> 00:14:35.675]  An astonishing 17 pupils at a single British school are in the process of changing gender.
[00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:38.417]  But they're not changing their gender, they're being sterilized.
[00:14:38.717 --> 00:14:39.898]  How do you make being sterilized?
[00:14:39.918 --> 00:14:41.920]  You can see them in the boardroom 40 years ago at Tavistock.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.561]  How do we get them to sterilize their kids?
[00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:44.421]  Too many people have it.
[00:14:44.721 --> 00:14:46.243]  Well, first we pesticide their brains.
[00:14:46.263 --> 00:14:48.504]  When they're mentally retarded, we get them convinced to be sterilized.
[00:14:48.524 --> 00:14:49.705]  We make it cool like it's a choice.
[00:14:49.725 --> 00:14:50.806]  People are into being augmented.
[00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:52.327]  You know, changing themselves.
[00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:54.088]  The human augmentation.
[00:14:54.808 --> 00:14:55.209]  That's it.
[00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:57.891]  We'll go with that and we'll have Hollywood say how great it is.
[00:14:58.151 --> 00:14:59.252]  It'll be a new civil right.
[00:14:59.972 --> 00:15:02.033]  Only around all these wars, murdering everybody, everything else.
[00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:06.514]  Most of the youngsters undergoing the transformation are autistic!
[00:15:07.055 --> 00:15:18.539]  According to a teacher there, who said vulnerable children with mental health problems are being tricked into believing they're the wrong sex, and now children as young as six are having the sex change, which isn't a sex change.
[00:15:19.272 --> 00:15:24.275]  Oh, my school taught me to have my testicles chopped off or to be chemically sterilized.
[00:15:24.895 --> 00:15:28.377]  Thank you for the gift of being barren in case I wanted to have kids later.
[00:15:28.597 --> 00:15:33.560]  But by the time I can actually figure it out, you'll actually sterilize me and statistically then I'll commit suicide.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.300]  I'm so depressed!
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.281]  Thank you!
[00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:36.461]  Oh, it's a liberal!
[00:15:38.783 --> 00:15:40.384]  That's the total cover of this.
[00:15:41.164 --> 00:15:43.805]  And it's all in the UN documents.
[00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:44.645]  It's all there.
[00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:45.645]  This plan.
[00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:48.046]  I used to read this stuff 20 years ago and go, they'll never do it.
[00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:49.166]  They're doing it now.
[00:15:49.887 --> 00:15:51.527]  But whatever you do, folks, be trendy.
[00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:57.029]  Let the state and the transgender cult have access to your autistic child.
[00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:59.650]  Let them have their genitals cut off.
[00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.370]  It's liberal.
[00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.450]  It's like the Muslims do.
[00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.831]  Cut them off now!
[00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:06.772]  You know why I love President Trump so much?
[00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:10.024]  It's because I know he's for real.
[00:16:10.585 --> 00:16:11.726]  He's trying the best he can.
[00:16:12.087 --> 00:16:15.932]  He's gotten so much done despite the enemies arrayed against him.
[00:16:16.713 --> 00:16:21.640]  And I've been really persecuted at a level we've never experienced before.
[00:16:23.628 --> 00:16:25.190]  50 times the level I've ever experienced.
[00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.632]  The demonization, the lies, the harassment, the fake lawsuits.
[00:16:29.493 --> 00:16:30.434]  Because I've supported Trump.
[00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:32.055]  Now why is that?
[00:16:32.295 --> 00:16:38.500]  It's because Trump supports the idea of the nation-state, a pro-human future, not a globalist technocracy.
[00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:40.503]  And he really does love this country.
[00:16:41.003 --> 00:16:51.294]  And nation-states stand in the way of mega-corporations allied with authoritarian regimes like China and the EU, dominating and oppressing and controlling populations.
[00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:55.719]  These people lust after controlling and running our lives.
[00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:56.460]  They want power.
[00:16:57.581 --> 00:17:05.064]  I just wanted to state here, with this being the week of Thanksgiving, that I am extremely thankful for President Trump, and I stand with President Trump.
[00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:09.426]  And I'm also extremely thankful to all of you out there.
[00:17:10.147 --> 00:17:13.428]  And I'm appreciative of you, and I love you, and I want to thank you.
[00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:17.270]  And I'm very, very humble for the support and the prayers.
[00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:40.677]  For all of you that have stood with them for wars over the years, and put up with my annex sometimes when I get off the rails, none of us are perfect, and I just want you to know that we are all unified in our love of God, our love of justice, our love of freedom, our love of the rule of law, our love of sovereignty, and this great experience of human life we're all experiencing together, and the long saga, the long march of humanity towards freedom.
[00:17:41.697 --> 00:17:44.920]  And the last 144 years of the American experience.
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.181]  What our ancestors have gone through together.
[00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:49.783]  America's destiny is very, very special.
[00:17:50.784 --> 00:18:01.633]  So no matter where you are in the world or what color you are or even what your religion is, if you have a sense of justice and a sense of wanting to stand up for the innocent and wanting to build a better world,
[00:18:02.453 --> 00:18:10.719]  And you understand that evil people come in and manipulate that goodness in our heart so that we give up our will, our free will, to them.
[00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:15.882]  So these vampires can direct us when they don't have consciences, but they know we have consciences.
[00:18:15.902 --> 00:18:16.943]  So it's a very...
[00:18:18.926 --> 00:18:29.630]  Delicate balance between being loving and being open and wanting to help people and being deceived and manipulated by bad people to end up doing evil things.
[00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:39.734]  But with Trump and with the American people and what you see with nationalism and patriotism and Christianity reawakening around the world, it's a very, very, very special time.
[00:18:40.575 --> 00:18:41.455]  And this is real.
[00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:43.116]  And we're all in this together.
[00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.457]  And Trump is fighting to deliver
[00:18:46.517 --> 00:18:50.579]  And to not betray, but he's not perfect and he can't act alone.
[00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:52.360]  He can't do this on his own.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:19:02.265]  And so we shouldn't be too faced, any of us, when we're with friends and family and neighbors and virtue signal when they attack Trump and throw him under the bus.
[00:19:02.785 --> 00:19:12.909]  We have to stand up for Trump when that happens because he is a microcosm or an archetype or a figurehead of the spirit of resistance and who we are.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:20.632]  And when we don't sit there and deny the fact that we respect and love him, it gives the enemy power.
[00:19:20.652 --> 00:19:25.414]  So we have to stand and be strong in the face of these bullies and say we're not backing down.
[00:19:25.654 --> 00:19:27.074]  And you have supported InfoWars.
[00:19:27.574 --> 00:19:28.535]  You've made it all possible.
[00:19:29.275 --> 00:19:31.896]  And so I want to thank all of you out there for what you've done.
[00:19:31.916 --> 00:19:33.976]  And I want to remind some of those out there that get depressed.
[00:19:33.996 --> 00:19:34.936]  I know I do sometimes.
[00:19:35.436 --> 00:19:36.557]  This is a long journey.
[00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:41.198]  And good ruling this planet is not going to be easy.
[00:19:41.498 --> 00:19:44.538]  That's why it's the Animated Contest of Liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:19:44.578 --> 00:19:46.119]  But we've done incredible things.
[00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:47.519]  We've come from way behind.
[00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:49.759]  Now the enemy's launching their counter-assault.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.400]  And we're living in history right now.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.620]  God bless you all.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.660]  Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.081]  And again, thank you all for your support of InfoWars.
[00:20:04.628 --> 00:20:08.731]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:10.592]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:12.373 --> 00:20:12.994]  Will you fight?
[00:20:14.115 --> 00:20:16.656]  Fight?
[00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:18.357]  Against that?
[00:20:18.738 --> 00:20:19.058]  No!
[00:20:19.758 --> 00:20:20.299]  We will run!
[00:20:21.379 --> 00:20:21.880]  And we will live!
[00:20:23.141 --> 00:20:23.581]  Aye?
[00:20:24.401 --> 00:20:25.342]  Fight and you may die.
[00:20:26.603 --> 00:20:27.904]  Run, and you'll live.
[00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:30.225]  At least a while.
[00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:33.668]  And dying in your beds, many years from now.
[00:20:34.997 --> 00:20:54.171]  Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
[00:20:54.231 --> 00:20:58.614]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:00.696]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:21:10.109 --> 00:21:26.361]  You know, standing up for the unborn, standing up for children that are born against this biological warfare globalist system, I feel ashamed that I'm not fighting harder and that I'm not more eloquent because the stakes are so high.
[00:21:27.935 --> 00:21:42.904]  I made jokes at the end of the last segment about how they claim it's all trendy and liberal to abuse children, as even Camille Pagli has said, as a liberal lesbian, to tell them that their biology is different when they haven't even made any decision about what their sexuality is.
[00:21:43.044 --> 00:21:44.385]  It is pedophilic!
[00:21:45.365 --> 00:21:46.646]  It is a cult of pedophiles!
[00:21:47.647 --> 00:21:54.251]  And I've been told publicly, and I've been told by Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and all of them, they said there's three pillars.
[00:21:56.349 --> 00:21:59.930]  You support transgenderism and telling children they have another gender.
[00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.211]  You support Islam invading and taking over and doing whatever they want.
[00:22:05.912 --> 00:22:12.054]  And you need to step aside and you need to accept the chemicals in the water, Jones.
[00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:14.134]  You shut up about that, we'll leave you alone.
[00:22:14.634 --> 00:22:23.777]  Because that's how they've got us between a radical, monotheistic death cult of Islam that enslaves its own people and is always taking over the next country,
[00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.716]  It's authoritarian and this scientific chemical warfare program...
[00:22:30.086 --> 00:22:34.848]  Hitting women with chemicals that hyper-feminize them and accelerate their cycle.
[00:22:35.508 --> 00:22:38.709]  Reduces women's fertility and kills them about 30 years young.
[00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:43.731]  And then men, it emasculates them and turns them into these bots.
[00:22:43.911 --> 00:22:46.072]  And the sperm counts down almost 90%.
[00:22:47.892 --> 00:22:49.273]  Genitalia is shrinking.
[00:22:49.353 --> 00:22:51.213]  And Africans, whites, it doesn't matter.
[00:22:51.834 --> 00:22:52.754]  Anybody in the Western world.
[00:22:53.294 --> 00:22:55.315]  Breast cancer is up multi-thousand percentage points.
[00:22:55.415 --> 00:22:56.515]  We're being murdered.
[00:22:57.636 --> 00:22:58.156]  Murdered!
[00:23:00.913 --> 00:23:01.493]  Well, what do you do?
[00:23:01.554 --> 00:23:02.594]  You make it fashionable.
[00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:09.560]  You don't come in and say, why is this type of hormone-based breast cancer up 4,000 or 5,000%?
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.162]  Brazil didn't have any of it until 25 years ago.
[00:23:12.482 --> 00:23:13.283]  There it is, glyphosate.
[00:23:13.303 --> 00:23:17.606]  Within one year, it went up multi-thousand percent in all areas where glyphosate was being used.
[00:23:17.626 --> 00:23:18.447]  That's just one chemical.
[00:23:18.987 --> 00:23:27.154]  Glyphosate mimics the hormone in the body that literally triggers tumors in the breast.
[00:23:28.348 --> 00:23:30.909]  Secondarily, men's prostates, but not as bad.
[00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:42.335]  Women are hammered with weed killer that tells weeds to die, and that tells women's breasts to die.
[00:23:44.676 --> 00:23:53.921]  Bottle of Roundup ought to say, Teton Killer, Mammary Killer, Breast Killer, Teat Killer.
[00:23:55.407 --> 00:23:56.308]  By the way, that's not profane.
[00:23:56.328 --> 00:23:57.309]  Those are all scientific names.
[00:23:57.449 --> 00:23:58.550]  And I'm not joking around here.
[00:23:58.871 --> 00:23:59.952]  This is deadly serious.
[00:24:00.592 --> 00:24:03.015]  Let's get over talking about subjects like this and let's get real.
[00:24:05.537 --> 00:24:08.720]  60 years ago, doctors would fly across the country to see a child with cancer.
[00:24:08.761 --> 00:24:11.663]  Now you can walk into any mall or grocery store and see them all over the place.
[00:24:12.344 --> 00:24:13.926]  This is being done by design.
[00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:18.275]  And I'd hope Trump would start doing something about this on vaccines and other areas.
[00:24:18.675 --> 00:24:30.343]  And he's been trying to get the economy on and the rest of it, but he's failed on bringing this out, even though he knows Barron got that third round of shots at 18 months and was running around talking, and the next day was having convulsions and crapping himself.
[00:24:30.723 --> 00:24:35.647]  And Barron came back, and Trump doesn't like people talking about it.
[00:24:36.769 --> 00:24:39.110]  But Trump knows damn well what's going on.
[00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.353]  That's why he said, when he was running for office, they're giving too many vaccines too early.
[00:24:44.873 --> 00:24:46.394]  It's what the Japanese government says.
[00:24:47.394 --> 00:24:50.656]  And their autism went from skyrocketing to down to very low.
[00:24:51.697 --> 00:24:53.838]  By law, you can't give shots till 18 months.
[00:24:54.498 --> 00:24:56.079]  Not three rounds by 18 months.
[00:24:56.859 --> 00:25:05.704]  It causes autoimmune disorders, it causes Guillain-Barre's, it causes narcolepsy, it causes epilepsy, it causes blood on the brain.
[00:25:08.024 --> 00:25:09.305]  And it's not by accident.
[00:25:11.106 --> 00:25:16.690]  This is the government caught, the deep state caught, giving black people syphilis for 49 years.
[00:25:17.771 --> 00:25:20.673]  But Tuskegee, why would you then trust anything they do?
[00:25:22.194 --> 00:25:25.376]  They got a big cover, Wired Magazine article saying, take Jones off the air.
[00:25:25.996 --> 00:25:27.437]  He says vaccines are dangerous.
[00:25:27.637 --> 00:25:29.479]  The inserts say they are.
[00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:32.060]  So listen, you're in the middle of a medical experiment.
[00:25:34.222 --> 00:25:34.342]  And
[00:25:36.383 --> 00:25:41.165]  If you want a brain-damaged, retarded child or a child that doesn't function at their main capacity, you want a dead child.
[00:25:41.405 --> 00:25:45.026]  Because I know multiple people that work in this building whose children were vaccinated who died.
[00:25:46.166 --> 00:25:49.047]  My grandmother got polio from her second polio round.
[00:25:49.087 --> 00:25:51.888]  The doctors told her, you got it from the polio vaccine that was live.
[00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.811]  My uncle that was going to go into professional baseball,
[00:26:00.106 --> 00:26:07.668]  And he was in perfect shape, took a tetanus shot when he was in high school and was in the hospital for three weeks and it almost killed him and brain damaged him to this day.
[00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:10.689]  He has convulsions.
[00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:13.050]  To this day.
[00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.431]  And they sit back and they say we're kooks and we're crazy for the facts.
[00:26:20.212 --> 00:26:20.352]  So.
[00:26:21.937 --> 00:26:26.221]  The pesticides, the chemicals, the vaccines, there are neurological disorders everywhere.
[00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:33.249]  1 in 33,000 in the 60s to 1 in 58 has autism, and they say it's going to double by 2030.
[00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:44.560]  We're going to have 1 out of 20-something having to be led around by their elderly parents while some full-grown man goes, and the left will go, you're making fun of them.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:44.720]  No!
[00:26:46.047 --> 00:26:53.974]  I'm saying you've done this to them, and then if I expose that I've seen full-grown men and women that are autistic, that I'm back because I'm describing how hellish it is.
[00:26:54.474 --> 00:26:57.517]  I try to go see a children's movie with my kids, and the theater's full.
[00:26:57.537 --> 00:27:02.842]  There's always, out of 200 people, like 50 banging their heads into the back of the chairs and going,
[00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:07.332]  What the hell's going on here?
[00:27:07.912 --> 00:27:09.733]  The left goes, look, he made fun of autistic kids.
[00:27:09.973 --> 00:27:11.953]  No, I'm, I, I expose what I'm seeing.
[00:27:12.173 --> 00:27:12.974]  I didn't make fun of them.
[00:27:13.214 --> 00:27:14.014]  I'm crying!
[00:27:14.854 --> 00:27:16.335]  I can barely be in these movies!
[00:27:17.956 --> 00:27:18.736]  I go to the mall.
[00:27:18.996 --> 00:27:21.217]  I see the ball-headed kids on their chemotherapy everywhere.
[00:27:21.537 --> 00:27:22.417]  What's going on?
[00:27:22.437 --> 00:27:25.659]  But see, it's never, find why everybody's getting breast cancer.
[00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.939]  Find out why everybody's becoming autistic.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.180]  It's never that.
[00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:34.307]  It's always find a cure.
[00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:36.948]  They know the cure, the globalists of the disease.
[00:27:37.848 --> 00:27:38.448]  Read the article.
[00:27:39.248 --> 00:27:44.310]  How they're brain damaging the kids and then telling retarded children, you have a choice.
[00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.511]  Have your testicles chopped off.
[00:27:45.911 --> 00:27:47.291]  And the mommies go, it's liberal.
[00:27:47.391 --> 00:27:50.752]  Okay, my eight year old retarded son wants his balls chopped off.
[00:27:52.913 --> 00:27:54.053]  That's it for this segment.
[00:27:54.314 --> 00:27:59.435]  We're going to come back on the other side with some of the best interviews we've done the last month.
[00:27:59.475 --> 00:28:00.596]  And then we'll be back after that.
[00:28:00.636 --> 00:28:00.976]  But listen,
[00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.071]  We're listener supported.
[00:28:03.131 --> 00:28:07.014]  They try to shut us down because they know if we get the word out, their evil system will be exposed.
[00:28:07.495 --> 00:28:09.276]  We are running, these are the last specials.
[00:28:09.316 --> 00:28:09.997]  Everything must go.
[00:28:10.417 --> 00:28:19.605]  This Black Friday week special, starting now, is 50% off all the supplements and pharmaceuticals, 50% off all the storable food, Alexa Pure Pro, their best unit, 127, 49% off, best deal ever.
[00:28:21.927 --> 00:28:25.451]  And double Patriot points, so that's towards your next purchase.
[00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:32.858]  Not just 5% at InfoWareStore.com, but 10%, plus 10% on all auto ship orders, free shipping store-wide.
[00:28:33.398 --> 00:28:35.180]  Summer is low at 75% off.
[00:28:35.621 --> 00:28:36.602]  Everything must go.
[00:28:36.622 --> 00:28:37.783]  The best quality products.
[00:28:37.803 --> 00:28:39.024]  Get your Christmas shopping done now.
[00:28:39.124 --> 00:28:40.145]  Don't fight the crowds.
[00:28:40.505 --> 00:28:41.907]  And fund the InfoWare of the future.
[00:28:42.347 --> 00:28:45.651]  Much of these products are being sold as lost leaders because everything must go.
[00:28:45.711 --> 00:28:46.912]  As you know, they're trying to shut us down.
[00:28:47.213 --> 00:28:51.598]  We've got to hunker down in case they're successful financially, be able to hold on for the next six months to a year.
[00:28:51.898 --> 00:28:53.961]  They have other backup plans and cavalry coming.
[00:28:54.281 --> 00:28:59.828]  We need you to be the cavalry right now at InfoWareStore.com and spread the word about the plan to sterilize and murder your children.
[00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:12.715]  As many of you know, we have just offered in the last few months the biggest sales in InfoWars history because the globalists have been trying to literally take our credit card processing away.
[00:29:12.735 --> 00:29:14.958]  They've been trying to hack our sites and bring them down.
[00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:17.282]  They have not been successful.
[00:29:17.902 --> 00:29:23.425]  Now, a lot of times, other companies claim they have the best deals of the year on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.
[00:29:23.885 --> 00:29:25.786]  And it's been in the news that a lot of those are scams.
[00:29:26.086 --> 00:29:33.930]  You know, have things in a limited amount to lure you in and have the retail jacked up above what it's supposed to be and then lower it down.
[00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.251]  There's a lot of scams going on.
[00:29:35.851 --> 00:29:38.772]  Zero of that is going on at Infoworkstore.com.
[00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:40.433]  And you're getting great deals.
[00:29:41.113 --> 00:29:43.615]  And we've got everything in stock right now, almost everything.
[00:29:44.455 --> 00:29:46.696]  And obviously you're funding the information war against the globalists.
[00:29:46.997 --> 00:29:48.137]  So it's a 360 win.
[00:29:48.497 --> 00:29:50.579]  Don't fight the traffic for Christmas shopping.
[00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:58.283]  Know you're supporting an organization and group that is absolutely driving the globalists crazy and raising the alarm worldwide.
[00:29:58.703 --> 00:30:02.045]  It is a 360 win on this Black Friday.
[00:30:02.085 --> 00:30:03.586]  But the sale isn't just this Black Friday.
[00:30:04.147 --> 00:30:06.028]  Monday through next Sunday,
[00:30:06.648 --> 00:30:11.373]  We are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[00:30:11.793 --> 00:30:14.356]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, free shipping storewide.
[00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:15.597]  Let me read this to you.
[00:30:16.658 --> 00:30:20.522]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:30:21.949 --> 00:30:26.210]  In fact, this is even... Okay, this is the best sale ever.
[00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:31.551]  Because we're doing the sale from a while back that was the best ever, with the free Chevy 50% off storewide.
[00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:37.432]  And double Patriot points, which a normal Patriot point is 5%, and so now this is 10%.
[00:30:37.892 --> 00:30:40.512]  So this makes a bunch of these complete lost leaders.
[00:30:40.552 --> 00:30:41.192]  This is insane.
[00:30:41.813 --> 00:30:42.853]  Okay, so let me be clear here.
[00:30:43.773 --> 00:30:45.193]  And just put this out like this.
[00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:46.873]  It's so much to say, we'll just put it out.
[00:30:47.213 --> 00:30:48.134]  No teleprompters here.
[00:30:48.554 --> 00:30:49.234]  Black Friday.
[00:30:50.454 --> 00:30:55.197]  InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:30:56.217 --> 00:31:02.361]  All InfoWars life supplements, 50% off with the free shipping and the double Patriot points.
[00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:07.944]  Up to 50% off on storable food, super high quality, that is huge.
[00:31:08.584 --> 00:31:11.065]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[00:31:11.465 --> 00:31:12.865]  Oh, this is the one that is the best ever.
[00:31:12.885 --> 00:31:18.827]  I can say on Black Friday, we've been running this sale a few weeks, this is the best we've ever done.
[00:31:18.847 --> 00:31:22.468]  $127, or 49% off, Alexa Pure Pro Gravity Fed Filters.
[00:31:23.168 --> 00:31:24.549]  One of the best systems out there.
[00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:25.549]  Leading competitors, $300, $400.
[00:31:25.609 --> 00:31:26.229]  They usually retail at $240.
[00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:30.910]  Six, that's a great deal.
[00:31:31.371 --> 00:31:40.654]  We now have it at $127 because they ordered too many and want to again sell them out before the new year so they don't have to pay inventory tax to the feds and the state.
[00:31:41.574 --> 00:31:45.156]  Alexa Pure Breeze, air filtration, now at 40% off.
[00:31:45.196 --> 00:31:47.557]  That's right at Lost Leader, again to get rid of inventory.
[00:31:47.737 --> 00:31:49.537]  So take advantage of that, it's an amazing system.
[00:31:50.298 --> 00:31:56.560]  Also, there's a bunch of special sections where we've got other deals at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.101]  Too many to name.
[00:31:58.422 --> 00:32:04.489]  Up to 75% off storewide, plus free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:11.197]  Up to 75% off storewide, plus free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:32:11.237 --> 00:32:16.262]  So, actually, now that I'm here looking at this and thinking, this is the best deal we've ever done.
[00:32:16.943 --> 00:32:18.365]  So it actually tops the last deal.
[00:32:18.925 --> 00:32:19.306]  And you know what?
[00:32:19.326 --> 00:32:20.327]  Just put this out like it is.
[00:32:20.367 --> 00:32:23.270]  Because it just shows how we're being transparent here.
[00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:24.751]  And this is so insane.
[00:32:24.771 --> 00:32:27.694]  They're trying to shut down our credit card processors.
[00:32:28.054 --> 00:32:29.396]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:32:29.416 --> 00:32:30.217]  They're trying to defund us.
[00:32:30.497 --> 00:32:33.280]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.802]  All of our inventory, I intend to have gone.
[00:32:36.263 --> 00:32:40.007]  So that we're at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[00:32:40.507 --> 00:32:45.392]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:45.612 --> 00:32:51.417]  Support the InfoWars, get great products, get your Christmas shopping done early, and battle the globalists.
[00:32:51.637 --> 00:32:53.900]  A total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.161]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:33:05.003 --> 00:33:10.945]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.028 --> 00:33:24.989]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:29.871]  You know,
[00:33:31.171 --> 00:33:36.356]  I don't want to defend Trump like I do because I don't want to be so completely committed to somebody.
[00:33:37.497 --> 00:33:39.699]  But always he's right.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.863]  And always the mainstream media represents what he's saying or doing.
[00:33:45.503 --> 00:33:46.865]  He says build fire breaks.
[00:33:47.765 --> 00:33:49.327]  They got rid of the policy 30 years ago.
[00:33:49.367 --> 00:33:50.448]  It's burning down the West.
[00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:54.211]  And all the firefighter associations say he's right.
[00:33:55.563 --> 00:33:57.204]  He says we gotta have a border with Mexico.
[00:33:57.224 --> 00:33:58.484]  There's a lot of criminals coming in.
[00:33:58.805 --> 00:34:00.025]  They say he hates all Mexicans.
[00:34:00.045 --> 00:34:00.565]  Never said it.
[00:34:02.887 --> 00:34:13.132]  And then I look at what they're currently doing and how our own media sides with Communist China against America.
[00:34:16.033 --> 00:34:23.817]  And I look at how the left, when you tune into what they're writing or saying in public schools or college,
[00:34:24.927 --> 00:34:27.568]  It is the most Nazi.
[00:34:29.328 --> 00:34:32.689]  They call us Nazis all day and I thought, that's dumb they call us Nazis.
[00:34:33.249 --> 00:34:34.089]  They know that's not true.
[00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:35.689]  That's because they're the Nazis.
[00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:43.351]  I mean, I have a longtime family friend going back to when I was a little kid.
[00:34:44.431 --> 00:34:50.412]  My best friend died about 10 years ago, but my best friend's mom, a big family friend, went on all these trips with us and
[00:34:52.498 --> 00:34:57.982]  One of her granddaughters was part African-American or whatever, and I'm good friends with her.
[00:34:58.582 --> 00:35:02.665]  And she went to Southwest Texas University the last few years.
[00:35:02.685 --> 00:35:03.745]  She's graduating right now.
[00:35:03.765 --> 00:35:08.688]  And they literally come into class and say, Alex Jones is a white supremacist.
[00:35:09.709 --> 00:35:12.191]  And Alex Jones is a Nazi.
[00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:13.672]  And Alex Jones is fake news.
[00:35:13.752 --> 00:35:15.072]  And she's known me her whole life.
[00:35:16.164 --> 00:35:19.528]  Camped out with me and been on boats with me and eaten dinner with me probably 50 times.
[00:35:20.088 --> 00:35:24.353]  And she got pissed and they said, listen, you shut your ass up, you get your, lose your degree.
[00:35:24.713 --> 00:35:32.021]  Well, that took her from being a liberal, for the good things liberals claim, to absolutely being against them.
[00:35:32.321 --> 00:35:33.262]  I'm not going to say her name.
[00:35:33.762 --> 00:35:34.984]  She's a beautiful young woman.
[00:35:36.837 --> 00:35:37.817]  But that's the thing.
[00:35:37.858 --> 00:35:39.418]  She's like, I know Alex Jones.
[00:35:40.019 --> 00:35:44.020]  That professor said, a white woman, you shut your ass up right now.
[00:35:44.081 --> 00:35:44.761]  He's a Nazi.
[00:35:45.321 --> 00:35:46.382]  She said, no, he's not.
[00:35:47.402 --> 00:35:48.723]  What you just said about him is a lie.
[00:35:49.123 --> 00:35:56.947]  And that's why they want to censor us and silence us so they can say whatever they want about us and not be challenged.
[00:35:58.187 --> 00:36:03.270]  You know, Joe Biggs, taking our guns is a big deal.
[00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.691]  Because slaves are disarmed.
[00:36:07.611 --> 00:36:20.798]  It's always the sign of where we're going to go next, but the taking of the First Amendment and the way they've targeted conservatives and nationalists that becomes a campaign contribution of the Democrats.
[00:36:21.558 --> 00:36:23.780]  This is the only reason the Republicans didn't keep the House.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.120]  They kept the Senate, which is historic.
[00:36:25.961 --> 00:36:27.361]  And we have to take action.
[00:36:27.441 --> 00:36:31.704]  And that's our biggest deficit is the average Republican doesn't know how this cyber stuff works.
[00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:37.790]  They won't even take Republican ads on Facebook or Twitter, on most of them, for Congress people.
[00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.471]  But they'll take Democrats.
[00:36:39.491 --> 00:36:42.792]  The fact that they let them do that is total discrimination.
[00:36:42.812 --> 00:36:44.012]  They go, oh, it's a private company.
[00:36:44.432 --> 00:36:46.553]  So newspapers won't take Republican ads either?
[00:36:47.094 --> 00:36:48.954]  Or if you're black, you can't rent a hotel room?
[00:36:49.654 --> 00:36:57.618]  This is so fundamental, and we've been free so long, the average conservative wants to play the part of kind of like, we're the establishment.
[00:36:57.678 --> 00:36:58.098]  We're not.
[00:36:58.838 --> 00:36:59.598]  We're the underdog.
[00:37:00.038 --> 00:37:01.179]  We better start acting like it, Joe.
[00:37:02.517 --> 00:37:05.739]  Yeah, I mean, you gotta look at the entire political spectrum right now.
[00:37:05.799 --> 00:37:07.460]  It's all changed after we elected Trump.
[00:37:07.521 --> 00:37:18.468]  I mean, you know, the typical boring, total line, you know, Christian, I'm married, and I have a wife, you know, and I've got a dog and three kids, and I was a vet.
[00:37:18.528 --> 00:37:23.472]  Like, that same kind of mentality these politicians use in all their videos doesn't work anymore.
[00:37:24.753 --> 00:37:28.637]  You know, people on the right need to realize that it's all shifting and changing.
[00:37:29.058 --> 00:37:39.468]  And if you really want to reach some of these younger people that are in college right now, and they're being brainwashed to go left, and there's many of them that are starting to think for themselves, and they're going, I want to go right, but it looks boring.
[00:37:39.528 --> 00:37:42.772]  I mean, Republicans at the end of the day are milquetoast most of the time.
[00:37:42.792 --> 00:37:43.833]  They're so boring.
[00:37:44.213 --> 00:37:45.775]  But you see a guy like Trump, man.
[00:37:45.815 --> 00:37:46.657]  He's so different.
[00:37:46.677 --> 00:37:47.598]  He's so energetic.
[00:37:48.018 --> 00:37:49.681]  A friend of mine the other day asked... Because he's a populist.
[00:37:49.721 --> 00:37:51.143]  He's not... No, no, exactly.
[00:37:51.363 --> 00:37:55.589]  There's nothing more boring than liberals obsessed with what Halloween costume you're wearing.
[00:37:55.869 --> 00:37:57.511]  Why are we letting them be the cool people?
[00:37:57.531 --> 00:37:58.032]  They're not.
[00:37:58.092 --> 00:37:59.134]  They're super uncool.
[00:38:00.871 --> 00:38:01.291]  Exactly.
[00:38:01.331 --> 00:38:04.613]  I mean, we need to really rethink our approach to politics.
[00:38:04.653 --> 00:38:12.776]  We need to really rethink our approach to how we push out our messages as conservatives, as Republicans, as right-wingers, whatever you are.
[00:38:13.296 --> 00:38:17.078]  We've really got to change that narrative, and we need to come out there attacking hard.
[00:38:17.338 --> 00:38:19.479]  I mean, look at Brian Kemp's ads.
[00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:25.241]  He was the only right-wing person that I saw, the guy that ran for governor in Georgia and finally won.
[00:38:26.902 --> 00:38:28.163]  His ads were amazing.
[00:38:28.303 --> 00:38:29.404]  They were hilarious.
[00:38:29.664 --> 00:38:30.785]  You could relate to it.
[00:38:31.105 --> 00:38:40.411]  At the end of the day, I mean, I thought about the ad throughout the day and I live in Florida and I'm thinking about, you know, this guy that's running for governor in Georgia because his ads really hit home.
[00:38:40.772 --> 00:38:56.082]  You know, he's like, yeah, I got a gun because when my daughter starts dating, I want to make sure that there's a good guy coming around or I drive a truck because I at least, uh, you know, in case I come up around, uh, you know, a bunch of migrants that are illegals, I can take them to the border patrol station and have them deported or whatever like that.
[00:38:56.102 --> 00:38:56.282]  You know,
[00:38:56.742 --> 00:39:03.053]  He's using these current events... He took the fake political correctness that obviously we're not doing that and made a joke.
[00:39:03.868 --> 00:39:07.429]  Yeah, exactly, and that's good, and that's what people on the right are going to have to start doing.
[00:39:07.689 --> 00:39:10.269]  Everyone's like, we have to be in the high ground, we have to take the high ground.
[00:39:10.489 --> 00:39:17.930]  Well, there's a war going on, there's people in the trenches, and the only ones that are coming out right now, the ones that are, you know, taking control, are the ones willing to get down there and get dirty.
[00:39:17.971 --> 00:39:18.771]  No, I totally agree.
[00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:27.432]  The whole blue blood thing, which is why I used to be neutral politically, the Republican blue bloods are the nastiest, dumbest, they're beyond racist.
[00:39:27.992 --> 00:39:30.613]  If you don't know their granddaddy's granddaddy, you aren't in the club.
[00:39:30.793 --> 00:39:31.513]  They're classist.
[00:39:32.153 --> 00:39:33.681]  And that's not what America is about.
[00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:36.033]  Well, Joe, the people just joined us.
[00:39:37.185 --> 00:39:40.528]  In the last few minutes we've got left for you in this segment, I've got some big news coming up in the next segment.
[00:39:41.468 --> 00:39:47.733]  You challenged Eric Schwall as well, and he said, I'll nuke your ass if you don't turn your guns in.
[00:39:48.233 --> 00:39:50.335]  This is one of the defining moments in America.
[00:39:50.355 --> 00:39:53.917]  There's a lot of stuff out there, but I agree, this is one of the dumbest tweets ever.
[00:39:54.378 --> 00:39:59.962]  This has really gone viral, so I congratulate you on reaching out to him and getting him to arrogantly say that.
[00:40:00.542 --> 00:40:02.464]  What do you think Chapter 2 is of this?
[00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:06.735]  Well, I'm actually trying to reach out to him and see if he'll have a sit down and talk.
[00:40:07.455 --> 00:40:28.640]  I'd like to really pick his brain and wonder why, or kind of get to understand why he thinks that that's a, you know, a correct response to this, and really find out if he truly does believe in the Constitution, if it's something he's really going to uphold, or is he just going to be a radical new leftist who's going to come in and try to reshape what this great country was founded on?
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.160]  And by the way!
[00:40:30.635 --> 00:40:34.860]  For those that just tuned in, he says he'll use nuclear weapons on those who don't turn their guns in.
[00:40:35.361 --> 00:40:39.706]  Which, militarily, all of it's pure bull, but... You say, oh, it's a joke.
[00:40:39.746 --> 00:40:40.326]  No, it's not a joke.
[00:40:40.687 --> 00:40:42.949]  It's about, they've got the weapons, we don't.
[00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:44.992]  It illustrates everything.
[00:40:45.032 --> 00:40:46.534]  This is totally crystal clear.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.343]  Yeah, it's just, it's something that needs to be talked about.
[00:40:51.604 --> 00:40:56.149]  And a guy like that, quite frankly, shouldn't even have the job that he has right now making a statement like that.
[00:40:56.389 --> 00:40:57.831]  Think about if Donald Trump said that.
[00:40:57.851 --> 00:41:08.202]  If Donald Trump even joked about using nuclear weapons against dissidents, against people who didn't like him, against fake news, he would, as soon as they took control of the House, he'd be gone.
[00:41:08.726 --> 00:41:12.249]  You know, they'd be like impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, and it'd be done.
[00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:20.256]  It wouldn't be one of those things that's kind of on the back burner where they're scared to do it, you know, and that's just that double standard that we see continuing to happen between the left and the right.
[00:41:20.296 --> 00:41:30.344]  If you're on the left, you can beat your wife, you can be a rapist, you can, you can, you know, collude with Russia, you can illegally spy on American citizens, that's okay.
[00:41:30.364 --> 00:41:31.205]  But if you're on the right,
[00:41:31.745 --> 00:41:36.328]  And you do anything at all, you're guilty without, you know, having your time in court.
[00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:38.329]  And it's just ridiculous.
[00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:41.631]  You lose your job, you lose your TV show, you can lose everything.
[00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:43.452]  You know, your social media accounts... Well, that's it.
[00:41:43.472 --> 00:41:51.036]  I mean, they're telling everybody, join us, don't have Alex Jones on, don't have Joe Biggs on, don't talk about Trump being good, or we'll attack you.
[00:41:51.076 --> 00:41:53.758]  This is pure bullying, and Americans have their line in the sand.
[00:41:53.778 --> 00:41:54.638]  They should say no to it.
[00:41:55.078 --> 00:41:57.880]  americantriggerpullers.com, Joe Biggs.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.301]  How do folks find you on Twitter?
[00:42:00.645 --> 00:42:01.486]  At Rambo Biggs.
[00:42:01.766 --> 00:42:03.127]  R-A-M-B-O-B-I-G-G-S.
[00:42:04.227 --> 00:42:05.108]  All right, great job.
[00:42:05.148 --> 00:42:06.529]  Thanks for spending so much time with us.
[00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:14.193]  And really great to see you to get Swallow's Well, Eric Swallow's Well, to come out and say, we're going to take your guns.
[00:42:14.233 --> 00:42:15.253]  Resistance is futile.
[00:42:15.654 --> 00:42:16.794]  Turn them in and we're going to nuke you.
[00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:17.735]  What an incredible moment.
[00:42:17.755 --> 00:42:18.155]  Thanks, Joe.
[00:42:18.175 --> 00:42:20.036]  I got a beard now.
[00:42:20.056 --> 00:42:22.157]  You like my beard?
[00:42:22.878 --> 00:42:23.218]  Yeah.
[00:42:23.598 --> 00:42:24.999]  I take mine off and you grow one.
[00:42:25.797 --> 00:42:32.038]  No, my son, you know Rex, we were in Hawaii like eight months ago, and he goes, Dad, he goes, can you grow a beard?
[00:42:32.058 --> 00:42:34.139]  And I said, yeah, son, I'll grow a beard.
[00:42:34.199 --> 00:42:34.839]  He said, grow a beard.
[00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:39.840]  And now, I got a wife, I love her, but the ladies like it so much, I can't stop.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.200]  I'm sorry, I had no idea.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.821]  Like, I'm in the beard cult now, I apologize.
[00:42:42.841 --> 00:42:45.241]  I'll grow a big, long, giant one like Santa Claus.
[00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:46.461]  Thanks, Joe Biggs.
[00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:48.902]  All right, when we come back,
[00:42:49.793 --> 00:42:53.095]  We are going to hit some of the key intel we've not covered yet.
[00:42:53.915 --> 00:42:56.517]  Tomorrow's news today, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:02.621 --> 00:43:09.645]  We have been in a continual state of war since we bought into the idea of a permanent standing army after World War II.
[00:43:10.686 --> 00:43:16.850]  We have a Saudi-led attack on Yemen, on the port, escalating in just a 24-hour span.
[00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.592]  At least 150 people killed after weeks of deadly fighting.
[00:43:20.952 --> 00:43:23.033]  Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Yemen.
[00:43:23.374 --> 00:43:24.194]  Any reporting on that?
[00:43:24.534 --> 00:43:24.754]  No.
[00:43:25.495 --> 00:43:26.836]  They don't care about the lives of people.
[00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:28.797]  They don't care about the lives of these Yemenis.
[00:43:28.837 --> 00:43:31.839]  They don't care about the lives of their own soldiers.
[00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:37.362]  And they don't care about the principles that these soldiers thought they were fighting for, either.
[00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:45.146]  The principles, just like the lives of the soldiers, are expendable in these manufactured wars for empire.
[00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:48.528]  Now, we've got something that is much more dangerous that is coming up right now.
[00:43:49.389 --> 00:43:55.433]  We're coming up to a cycle in human history, a generational turning point.
[00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:58.855]  And again, you should read the book, Fourth Turning, if you haven't.
[00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:09.929]  Strauss and Howe went back 500 years in American and English-British history to see this recurring cycle about every 80 years having a major restructuring of society.
[00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.233]  Frequently, these restructurings are accompanied by wars.
[00:44:15.214 --> 00:44:18.076]  Things like the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II.
[00:44:18.116 --> 00:44:20.878]  Those were all fourth turning.
[00:44:20.918 --> 00:44:26.242]  Now, as we talk about resurging old demons, that's what I see coming.
[00:44:27.183 --> 00:44:29.005]  I see history being recycled.
[00:44:30.607 --> 00:44:52.858]  And when you have these standing armies, when you have these politicians who have an empire mindset like MacDonald, who are trying to accrue and concentrate power to themselves, those are the elements that create things like World War I. Because it was the type of thing that the founders had always looked at Europe as having.
[00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:56.320]  These constant, eternal European wars.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.741]  Not a remaking of society.
[00:44:58.899 --> 00:45:01.203]  Because, you know, people look at that and they say, that was a just war.
[00:45:01.424 --> 00:45:03.227]  That was a justifiable war, whatever.
[00:45:03.247 --> 00:45:09.779]  They look at the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, they look at World War II, and they say, yeah, that was a time when we were really fighting for something.
[00:45:09.819 --> 00:45:11.161]  World War I, they weren't fighting for anything.
[00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:14.830]  Patriotism was summed up by Smedley Butler.
[00:45:15.111 --> 00:45:20.093]  He said, talking about true patriotism, he said, we fight to protect our home.
[00:45:20.214 --> 00:45:22.715]  And our Constitution.
[00:45:22.735 --> 00:45:24.556]  So we fight to defend our lives.
[00:45:24.616 --> 00:45:27.418]  To defend our lives.
[00:45:27.498 --> 00:45:29.959]  Not in foreign wars of empire.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.861]  Not for regime change in the Middle East.
[00:45:33.401 --> 00:45:35.002]  We fight to defend our homes.
[00:45:35.042 --> 00:45:36.823]  He said, everything else is a racket.
[00:45:37.283 --> 00:45:38.904]  It is organized crime.
[00:45:38.984 --> 00:45:39.805]  And he was exactly right.
[00:45:41.223 --> 00:45:42.724]  We fight to defend our Constitution.
[00:45:42.764 --> 00:45:44.146]  We're fighting to defend our values.
[00:45:45.027 --> 00:45:46.027]  That is what nationalism is about.
[00:45:46.328 --> 00:45:49.411]  Patriotism is about fighting to defend your homeland.
[00:45:50.271 --> 00:46:00.441]  Nationalism is about fighting to defend your political system and the values embodied in that political and legal system in our Constitution.
[00:46:00.501 --> 00:46:03.584]  And if we had stuck to those values, we would have never been drawn into World War I.
[00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:11.434]  Maybe Emmanuel Macron should read the writing of our former president James Madison, father of the Bill of Rights.
[00:46:12.175 --> 00:46:13.076]  He said, throughout Europe,
[00:46:14.019 --> 00:46:20.844]  The armies kept under the pretext of defending have enslaved the people.
[00:46:20.984 --> 00:46:26.788]  And quite frankly, that is the true purpose of Macron's EU army.
[00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:31.291]  He's not going to be putting that up there to protect them from foreign invasions.
[00:46:31.331 --> 00:46:33.193]  He's inviting the foreign invaders.
[00:46:34.173 --> 00:46:38.196]  The fifth column coming into the country.
[00:46:38.216 --> 00:46:39.157]  He's opened up the borders.
[00:46:39.197 --> 00:46:41.719]  He's part of the globalist open border cartel.
[00:46:43.414 --> 00:46:46.276]  He is not going to defend people.
[00:46:46.296 --> 00:46:50.979]  He's going to use the army to attack the people who object to that.
[00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:54.181]  To object to having their homes destroyed.
[00:46:54.301 --> 00:47:01.206]  Armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.
[00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:11.213]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:25.972]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:27.694 --> 00:47:30.798]  You know, somebody's got big plans for this planet.
[00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:35.962]  And, you know, I want humans to have a place in that future.
[00:47:36.862 --> 00:47:37.982]  I want a pro-human future.
[00:47:38.643 --> 00:47:40.683]  Big tech companies say, oh, humans are done.
[00:47:40.703 --> 00:47:43.344]  The silicon age is coming, we're obsolete.
[00:47:43.984 --> 00:47:46.725]  Yeah, we're gonna wipe everybody out in a bioweapon attack.
[00:47:47.685 --> 00:47:49.105]  But it's okay, we're superior.
[00:47:49.706 --> 00:47:51.886]  That's official globalist doctrine.
[00:47:52.826 --> 00:47:54.127]  But it's not discussed on the news.
[00:47:56.387 --> 00:48:02.089]  You know, it's weird how the globalists say, oh, the public are idiots, don't worry about them, let's just say it out in the open.
[00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:07.583]  And then when we cover it, they try to shut us down and say, don't say that.
[00:48:09.224 --> 00:48:11.245]  So see, at least the public's now listening.
[00:48:12.966 --> 00:48:13.547]  Here's the thing.
[00:48:15.348 --> 00:48:24.433]  I'm not a person that thinks of my competition in how much money I've got or how big a string of women I got.
[00:48:25.354 --> 00:48:32.198]  Doesn't mean I don't like money, doesn't mean I don't like women, but it's an intellectual endeavor.
[00:48:36.089 --> 00:48:44.730]  And my greatest frustration is that I really care about humanity.
[00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.191]  I really care about our future.
[00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:51.792]  I really can see the potentiality of our larger destiny.
[00:48:54.832 --> 00:49:05.494]  And I've seen the fallen, twisted servants of evil come after me and try to shut us down because we have the cure to their disease.
[00:49:08.018 --> 00:49:12.400]  And I don't sit back when I'm driving home at night and think, man, you're really a badass.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:24.664]  You know, you, you, you've got David Rockefeller's organizations and Henry Kissinger's organizations and the Clintons and the EU all after you.
[00:49:24.684 --> 00:49:30.086]  I actually sit back and go, my God, isn't this choice really easy?
[00:49:30.827 --> 00:49:35.208]  How am I one of the prime movers in the resistance against this?
[00:49:35.268 --> 00:49:37.229]  So here's the big secret.
[00:49:41.534 --> 00:49:47.337]  I'm not up here saying these things on air trying to impress you.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:50:01.384]  I'm not up here saying these things proudly like, wow, I've got kryptonite to the globalists.
[00:50:02.125 --> 00:50:10.269]  I'm actually pretty upset because I'm projecting onto you that you are just like me.
[00:50:11.698 --> 00:50:13.559]  And the globalist at Benton said, you're not.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:14.580]  You're dumb.
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:15.581]  You're stupid.
[00:50:15.621 --> 00:50:16.461]  You're backstabbing.
[00:50:16.962 --> 00:50:18.583]  You want your 30 pieces of silver.
[00:50:18.683 --> 00:50:20.644]  You don't want the universe.
[00:50:21.085 --> 00:50:24.327]  You're going to settle out here now at this level and never go forward.
[00:50:24.347 --> 00:50:27.469]  Well, a lot of you may do that, but I'm looking for the people that aren't.
[00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:33.353]  And it doesn't mean I've got all the answers and that I'm your guru.
[00:50:34.314 --> 00:50:35.235]  There are no gurus.
[00:50:38.497 --> 00:50:39.478]  All there are cults.
[00:50:42.628 --> 00:50:47.971]  The priest class setting itself in front of your relationship with God and your creator.
[00:50:50.653 --> 00:50:54.876]  So I'll say this as clear as I've ever said it to everybody out there watching and listening.
[00:50:56.837 --> 00:51:01.340]  There is a war on for your soul and your consciousness.
[00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:07.464]  And that doesn't mean we're gonna toddle into the nearest church and find God there.
[00:51:07.504 --> 00:51:10.046]  In fact, most of the time, you're gonna find the devil
[00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:15.209]  Because the devil puts himself in front of the gate to get to the universe and God.
[00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:21.332]  And all the symbols you see, the all-seeing eye, everything else, the rising sun.
[00:51:21.652 --> 00:51:22.753]  Oh, those are the devil's sign.
[00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:23.313]  No, they're not.
[00:51:24.093 --> 00:51:25.194]  God created mathematics.
[00:51:25.634 --> 00:51:26.314]  God created everything.
[00:51:26.615 --> 00:51:31.697]  The devil has seized control of all the symbols to make you think that the devil is God.
[00:51:31.737 --> 00:51:32.658]  The devil is not God.
[00:51:34.759 --> 00:51:39.361]  So, there are people
[00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:49.772]  Who are missing a connection to God, who are seeking to suppress your consciousness and your mind so that they can rule over you.
[00:51:52.372 --> 00:51:53.012]  And that's a fact.
[00:51:54.573 --> 00:51:55.493]  No one can deny that.
[00:51:58.433 --> 00:52:07.515]  And for me, it's a very frustrating fact that there are these horrible world government forces
[00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:18.318]  That are doing everything they can to suppress knowledge and technological development and honorableness and goodness and healthiness.
[00:52:18.358 --> 00:52:28.485]  Because at this point in culture, if people pushed healthiness and goodness and family and God and Christ, we would already be next galaxy over.
[00:52:28.705 --> 00:52:29.766]  It'd be over.
[00:52:30.467 --> 00:52:36.932]  And there's a real force, spiritually, intergalactically,
[00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:39.270]  Interdimensionally?
[00:52:40.431 --> 00:52:58.717]  However you quantify that, that is doing everything it can in its crib to strangle humanity and to mutate humanity and to whisper in our ear and kill our own instinct to want to be with God.
[00:53:01.618 --> 00:53:05.599]  And so I'm not pleased that I am the vanguard,
[00:53:09.326 --> 00:53:10.047]  of the resistance.
[00:53:11.308 --> 00:53:19.134]  This is so on its face, prima facie, easy to accept, easy to know, easy to go with.
[00:53:19.674 --> 00:53:21.096]  God's already got it all planned out.
[00:53:21.156 --> 00:53:23.378]  We just have to go with free will and choose God's plan.
[00:53:28.702 --> 00:53:34.507]  And so that's why I'm really frustrated is because there really isn't a choice here.
[00:53:34.607 --> 00:53:37.149]  There's oblivion and death or there's eternal life.
[00:53:39.656 --> 00:53:55.947]  God's created a stairway to heaven through free will, but you aren't going to be let into the next dimension unless you've chosen to not be a horrible, deceitful, manipulative devil.
[00:53:58.257 --> 00:54:05.840]  So a lot of people kind of rise up in their awareness and they figure out there's a scam going on and people are being manipulated and they go, oh great, this is great.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.481]  If I dumb these people down, if I screw them over, I'm ascendant.
[00:54:09.581 --> 00:54:11.741]  No, you're lower than they are.
[00:54:15.403 --> 00:54:17.003]  You're winning in a fallen system.
[00:54:20.244 --> 00:54:23.865]  So if you sit back and you look at why is InfoWars so banned?
[00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:25.246]  Why is it so hated?
[00:54:26.334 --> 00:54:29.816]  It's the same reason Trump is hated and defiled.
[00:54:31.037 --> 00:54:39.822]  Because Trump doesn't want to see the world burn so that he can sit on top of the ashes and feel powerful.
[00:54:40.983 --> 00:54:48.947]  Trump feels better and more successful when things are successful, when things are beautiful, when things are strong.
[00:54:49.588 --> 00:54:54.871]  And those that don't think they can meet that mark, they're fundamentally against that.
[00:54:56.331 --> 00:55:01.132]  And that's when you realize the fallen only can pull down the universe.
[00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:13.715]  They don't have the idea of expanding it because that's very scary to lower intellects, to see other people informed, to see other people racing ahead, to see other people having great experiences.
[00:55:14.615 --> 00:55:17.716]  They are cut off from that consciousness.
[00:55:18.336 --> 00:55:21.077]  And so to them, it's like death.
[00:55:25.325 --> 00:55:38.597]  So in the two minutes and 20 seconds we have left, I just want to let the listeners know that you've done an amazing job supporting InfoWars, and our affiliates have, and so has the crew.
[00:55:40.018 --> 00:55:44.542]  But I don't want to make it about InfoWars in the final equation.
[00:55:45.343 --> 00:55:52.429]  I want to make it about the fact that in a world of 7 billion plus people,
[00:55:54.639 --> 00:55:58.582]  You found InfoWars and you resonated with InfoWars.
[00:55:59.603 --> 00:56:15.176]  And not because InfoWars was the highest level of human outreach, but because all of us together were looking for a better world and trying to be good and coming together.
[00:56:15.296 --> 00:56:23.843]  And it's that idea of us communicating, of us having community, of us having brethren, of us having kinship,
[00:56:24.523 --> 00:56:30.885]  Of us communicating, of us edifying each other, of us coming together and even having a chance to communicate.
[00:56:30.905 --> 00:56:33.386]  That is the ultimate sin of the globalists.
[00:56:34.346 --> 00:56:39.948]  And that, when you read their writings, their leaked documents, they say we can't let them have comment sections on articles.
[00:56:40.448 --> 00:56:45.790]  They're communicating, they're getting reinforcement, they're getting stronger.
[00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:47.350]  We have to suppress that.
[00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:49.751]  But even if you're in a jail cell alone,
[00:56:50.984 --> 00:56:52.869]  And you know God, and you know justice.
[00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:54.974]  You're already connected to the universe.
[00:56:55.916 --> 00:56:57.861]  These controllers don't have anything over you.
[00:56:59.534 --> 00:57:01.395]  They're not the elite, they're the fallen people.
[00:57:02.036 --> 00:57:05.918]  And we're sad they won't join us, but we can't let them suppress us.
[00:57:06.559 --> 00:57:08.640]  We can't let them stand against what we're doing.
[00:57:09.281 --> 00:57:12.102]  We can't let them hurt the innocents anymore.
[00:57:12.543 --> 00:57:16.205]  These young souls that are so ready to be part of infinity with us.
[00:57:17.266 --> 00:57:20.168]  And so, it's all a big joke on the other side.
[00:57:20.768 --> 00:57:24.130]  They kill these bodies, you look back later and laugh.
[00:57:25.131 --> 00:57:26.192]  These bodies are nothing.
[00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:29.434]  Like a pair of clothes, but they're all trash.
[00:57:30.494 --> 00:57:35.955]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:58:00.603 --> 00:58:02.164]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[00:58:02.204 --> 00:58:02.805]  It's a good thing.
[00:58:02.845 --> 00:58:06.068]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:58:06.628 --> 00:58:09.050]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:10.151]  I learned what the best was.
[00:58:10.831 --> 00:58:24.082]  An Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:29.547]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:58:29.707 --> 00:58:34.171]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[00:58:34.651 --> 00:58:37.033]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:42.078]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotsApply that have developed these filters.
[00:58:43.752 --> 00:58:45.453]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:58:46.214 --> 00:58:48.495]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[00:58:48.515 --> 00:58:55.940]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[00:58:56.141 --> 00:58:58.862]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[00:58:59.443 --> 00:59:01.424]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[00:59:01.564 --> 00:59:02.405]  Texas has that too.
[00:59:02.905 --> 00:59:06.668]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[00:59:07.228 --> 00:59:10.050]  So he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:59:12.588 --> 00:59:16.574]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[00:59:16.954 --> 00:59:19.037]  We normally sell for $249, it's a great deal.
[00:59:19.638 --> 00:59:22.762]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[00:59:23.123 --> 00:59:23.443]  It's $127!
[00:59:24.164 --> 00:59:27.969]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[00:59:28.883 --> 00:59:29.964]  I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[00:59:30.024 --> 00:59:32.125]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[00:59:32.165 --> 00:59:33.125]  I mean, I'm all for great deals.
[00:59:33.305 --> 00:59:34.346]  This is insane.
[00:59:34.686 --> 00:59:36.467]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:59:36.887 --> 00:59:38.868]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family.
[00:59:38.888 --> 00:59:40.269]  Get the best, the best deal.
[00:59:40.649 --> 00:59:42.870]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:43.490]  It's amazing.
[00:59:43.571 --> 00:59:49.614]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.101 --> 00:59:59.683]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:59.703 --> 01:00:00.944]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:01.024 --> 01:00:03.585]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.818 --> 01:00:18.820]  Mark Dice is joining us in the next hour, this hour.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:22.942]  We've got a very special guest who's going to be in studio, Katie Hopkins.
[01:00:23.582 --> 01:00:26.544]  Katie Hopkins on Twitter, Hopkinsworld.com.
[01:00:27.464 --> 01:00:35.809]  And then I've just got, you've got to stay tuned for this broadcast, and you've got it later when we upload it to M4Wars.com, the audio and the video, you've got to get it out to people.
[01:00:36.509 --> 01:00:38.750]  Because I haven't even gotten into the news yet.
[01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:43.993]  It is what's happening in Israel, and they're already at war with Hezbollah.
[01:00:45.461 --> 01:00:48.984]  We've got the total election fraud continuing a week later.
[01:00:49.004 --> 01:00:51.467]  Democrats are just stealing everything.
[01:00:51.787 --> 01:00:52.588]  Any close races.
[01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.210]  All the fake ballots they need are being produced.
[01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.971]  They're even getting caught.
[01:00:56.231 --> 01:00:56.812]  It doesn't matter.
[01:00:56.832 --> 01:00:57.693]  It's all happening.
[01:00:59.214 --> 01:01:02.637]  Gentlemen, how do you see this all ending?
[01:01:02.697 --> 01:01:06.501]  Because Trump finally gets the fact that the globalists don't want prosperity.
[01:01:06.521 --> 01:01:07.182]  They want to destroy him.
[01:01:07.202 --> 01:01:09.504]  And then he's been lied to by a bunch of double-dealing cowards.
[01:01:09.524 --> 01:01:10.325]  He's about to remove them.
[01:01:11.647 --> 01:01:12.367]  Well Alex, I can't really say.
[01:01:12.427 --> 01:01:14.188]  I do know that they're trying to destroy me financially.
[01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:17.770]  They're trying to drive my family to bankruptcy because I refuse to fold.
[01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:21.051]  I am not going to plead guilty to some
[01:01:33.621 --> 01:01:37.169]  Bogus crime, particularly perjury, that I am not guilty of.
[01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:40.797]  I've committed no offense in connection with the 2016 election.
[01:01:41.278 --> 01:01:44.024]  I'm being persecuted because I appear on InfoWars.
[01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:48.233]  I'm being persecuted because I supported Donald Trump for president.
[01:01:48.713 --> 01:01:53.235]  I'm being persecuted because I was effective in the defeat of Hillary Clinton.
[01:01:53.655 --> 01:01:56.336]  This is, as the president says, a witch hunt.
[01:01:57.036 --> 01:01:59.377]  And I think Mr. Mueller is running out of time.
[01:01:59.398 --> 01:02:04.860]  And he now has oversight from a real attorney general who's committed to the rule of law.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.201]  Beyond that, I can't speculate.
[01:02:08.775 --> 01:02:10.296]  What should Trump do right now?
[01:02:10.316 --> 01:02:14.679]  Because I know the governor a week, five days ago in Florida, ordered them to impound the ballots.
[01:02:14.699 --> 01:02:15.299]  They're not doing that.
[01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:17.280]  They're just showing up with more totally illegally.
[01:02:19.382 --> 01:02:21.443]  Well, you've got several things going on at once.
[01:02:21.543 --> 01:02:34.671]  First of all, we have a recount on, but if any county fails to complete the recount, which is an arduous process, by the deadline, then the numbers they reported on election night stand.
[01:02:35.191 --> 01:02:37.714]  That would appear to benefit the Republicans.
[01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:57.234]  Yet in Broward County, specifically, votes that have been disallowed by the election board as not valid are now being counted and Republican observers are being denied access to the recount process in violation of the state sunshine law.
[01:02:57.714 --> 01:02:58.255]  So, um,
[01:02:58.895 --> 01:03:00.416]  This is up for grabs.
[01:03:01.397 --> 01:03:15.665]  The real hero here is Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has directed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Secretary of State to investigate those two infractions that I just mentioned.
[01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:19.667]  Tyler, put a cherry on top of the situation for us.
[01:03:20.748 --> 01:03:22.169]  I think the Democrats
[01:03:22.702 --> 01:03:29.385]  Securing of the House of Representatives will prove to, in short, Donald Trump's re-election as president in 2020.
[01:03:29.946 --> 01:03:47.394]  I think they will lose seats and there will be a reversal because people will see that they stand for nothing, that all they're interested in doing is basically hatred and street violence and endorsing and abetting essentially sedition and these types of un-American activities.
[01:03:48.094 --> 01:03:48.354]  I think?
[01:04:04.222 --> 01:04:11.969]  You know, whatever you want to call it, investigation-o-rama, where they don't stand for anything except literally just constantly hounding the man in charge, the man in the arena.
[01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:27.203]  And I think Donald Trump, if he's able to keep his cool and not get too wrapped up in the attempts of people like Adam Schiff and these other little hen-pecking nothings who, you know, and future president Eric Swalwell, right, yeah, sure.
[01:04:28.584 --> 01:04:34.710]  If he maintains his cool and we all continue to plow forward, I think we're going to see victory in 2020 and beyond.
[01:04:35.031 --> 01:04:37.954]  And the Democrats are going to collapse into oblivion where they belong.
[01:04:38.652 --> 01:04:48.735]  That's right, and you know, just like your ancestor Richard Nixon should have gone on the offense earlier, Trump must go on the offense now or they are going to destroy him because he is for this country and he is delivering.
[01:04:48.795 --> 01:04:53.256]  And they are literally enemies of this country and work for the globalists and hate America.
[01:04:53.296 --> 01:04:54.656]  That is their official policy.
[01:04:54.996 --> 01:04:55.636]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[01:04:55.956 --> 01:04:57.957]  We'll be back with Katie Hopkins and more.
[01:04:57.997 --> 01:04:58.397]  Stay with us.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:09.343]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:11.144]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[01:05:11.184 --> 01:05:11.805]  It's a good thing.
[01:05:11.845 --> 01:05:15.047]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[01:05:15.427 --> 01:05:17.768]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[01:05:17.808 --> 01:05:18.909]  I learned what the best was.
[01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:24.294]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[01:05:24.434 --> 01:05:24.955]  It's amazing.
[01:05:25.175 --> 01:05:27.577]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[01:05:27.737 --> 01:05:34.424]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotsSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[01:05:34.604 --> 01:05:36.205]  He has a glut of them.
[01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.548]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:43.230]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:43.890]  It's $127!
[01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:48.391]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $20-something bucks on them.
[01:05:48.771 --> 01:05:50.551]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:53.132]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:53.752]  It's amazing.
[01:05:53.832 --> 01:05:59.853]  AlexaPurePro at InfowarsLife.com or InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:14.399 --> 01:06:19.337]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.197 --> 01:06:42.819]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:06:42.839 --> 01:06:45.340]  Katie Hopkins, syndicated radio host, TV host.
[01:06:46.301 --> 01:06:49.383]  They have government-funded plays in the UK calling for her murder.
[01:06:50.343 --> 01:06:53.025]  She's going to be in studio with us about five minutes to the next hour.
[01:06:53.065 --> 01:06:55.186]  Then Mark Dice is going to be with us as well.
[01:06:55.246 --> 01:06:57.528]  He's got a new book out and a lot of other big developments.
[01:06:57.568 --> 01:06:58.468]  Very excited about that.
[01:06:58.508 --> 01:07:02.831]  And then PJW from England, always a heavy hitter.
[01:07:03.291 --> 01:07:07.714]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the War Room with Owen Schroyer and Roger Stone today.
[01:07:07.894 --> 01:07:09.395]  Everything is coming to a head.
[01:07:10.646 --> 01:07:11.206]  He just joined us.
[01:07:11.246 --> 01:07:24.093]  There is a huge One News American Network, OAN, One American News Network video, special report, where they got in to the Justice Department, where it showed the documents that Trump talked about a month ago.
[01:07:25.454 --> 01:07:26.874]  No evidence of Russia collusion.
[01:07:27.355 --> 01:07:31.457]  Mueller's investigation is coming to an end, but they want some fake indictments for perjury.
[01:07:32.506 --> 01:07:33.127]  That is huge.
[01:07:33.167 --> 01:07:36.289]  That is on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:45.658]  Trump is pointing out the Democrats are trying to implode the economy, working as hard as they can, saying they're going to bring back the regulations that brought the jobs back.
[01:07:46.118 --> 01:07:48.741]  And so Trump's right when he says they're the ones killing the economy.
[01:07:49.952 --> 01:07:56.715]  Stock market, you know, plunged last week and yesterday it's come back up some because they're saying they want to hurt the economy to hurt Trump.
[01:07:56.775 --> 01:07:58.296]  I mean, Democrats say it on the news.
[01:07:58.376 --> 01:07:59.196]  Bill Maher says it.
[01:07:59.317 --> 01:08:02.678]  It's just true sabotage against the nation.
[01:08:03.198 --> 01:08:07.821]  And then I'm going to read from the Constitution because the Democrats are now filing suits
[01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:16.379]  And saying that Trump can't fire an Attorney General and then bring in one for confirmation when it's in the Constitution.
[01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:19.542]  So next level disinfo.
[01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:26.870]  The Pope's come out and said stop investigations into pedophilia and don't have a vote by the Cardinals to call for it.
[01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:29.953]  Cover it up because he is up to his eyeballs in it.
[01:08:31.072 --> 01:08:32.173]  Vatican orders U.S.
[01:08:32.213 --> 01:08:35.656]  bishops to postpone crucial vote on sexual abuse claims.
[01:08:36.156 --> 01:08:37.097]  It's totally public.
[01:08:37.177 --> 01:08:37.737]  It's admitted.
[01:08:38.298 --> 01:08:39.258]  It is unbelievable.
[01:08:39.358 --> 01:08:41.640]  Some of it including satanic rituals.
[01:08:42.141 --> 01:08:45.483]  Just like we've seen this pop up over and over and over and over again.
[01:08:45.803 --> 01:08:51.228]  CNN, as we told you days ago, has now sued President Trump and his top aides, saying you can't kick them out of the White House.
[01:08:51.888 --> 01:08:55.371]  They lobbied to have our press credentials pulled, which was done.
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:57.541]  A year and a half ago.
[01:08:58.502 --> 01:08:59.983]  I mean, they are just monsters!
[01:09:00.064 --> 01:09:01.125]  They are monsters!
[01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:03.287]  They are unbelievable!
[01:09:04.809 --> 01:09:17.682]  They call for deplatforming, banning all conservatives, not letting conservatives have political advertising, and then they're going to have hearings in two months when they get into office in January, and they've said publicly.
[01:09:18.615 --> 01:09:25.117]  That they're going to have hearings on the attack on the First Amendment when it's Obama that sent hundreds of journalists and whistleblowers to prison.
[01:09:25.437 --> 01:09:26.757]  And Trump has done no such thing.
[01:09:27.077 --> 01:09:29.018]  These people are monsters.
[01:09:29.418 --> 01:09:31.159]  And they are murdering the truth.
[01:09:31.759 --> 01:09:32.239]  Big time.
[01:09:32.659 --> 01:09:35.800]  Just like they're stealing the election, endangering our republic.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:39.201]  There's a very important report on Infowars.com by Harrison Smith.
[01:09:39.761 --> 01:09:42.402]  What's happening in Florida threatens to collapse our Republic.
[01:09:42.442 --> 01:09:45.644]  The Democrats have gotten away with so much, they're stealing it all over the nation.
[01:09:46.084 --> 01:09:47.424]  You thought the election ended a week ago?
[01:09:47.785 --> 01:09:51.486]  They're taking more and more House seats, Senate seats, gubernatorial seats, everywhere!
[01:09:52.407 --> 01:09:53.607]  Last night in Arizona!
[01:09:54.307 --> 01:09:54.948]  Clear fraud!
[01:09:56.628 --> 01:09:58.929]  We are dealing with criminals making their move.
[01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:00.870]  America has not rejected Trump.
[01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:04.212]  The Democrats are involved in massive fraud.
[01:10:05.253 --> 01:10:06.534]  To the next level, to block it.
[01:10:06.954 --> 01:10:10.676]  We're going to air this special report by John Bowne dealing with the global treason.
[01:10:11.296 --> 01:10:15.818]  Our media, it's globalist media, says it's treason if Trump says a nation exists.
[01:10:16.258 --> 01:10:22.321]  Macron says the same thing now while he establishes an EU army to not let nation states leave who never voted to enter it.
[01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:25.883]  They're even threatening an EU army against the UK with Brexit.
[01:10:26.741 --> 01:10:29.823]  Wow, these really are incredible times we're living in.
[01:10:30.424 --> 01:10:32.305]  It's all happening in front of us.
[01:10:32.846 --> 01:10:33.927]  So here's John Bowne's report.
[01:10:34.007 --> 01:10:35.928]  We'll come back with Katie Hopkins in studio.
[01:10:36.228 --> 01:10:38.510]  I'm Alex Jones in fullwars.com.
[01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:39.411]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:10:40.091 --> 01:10:44.515]  It can be a difficult dilemma explaining where you stand as an American.
[01:10:44.755 --> 01:10:52.141]  The rampant betrayal has driven many away from a Congress with what is better described as a high disapproval rating.
[01:10:52.421 --> 01:11:03.264]  So, when President Trump echoed the core beliefs of a majority of Americans... As President of the United States, I will always put America first.
[01:11:04.165 --> 01:11:13.888]  Just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always, and should always, put your countries first.
[01:11:14.148 --> 01:11:17.289]  Well, you say nationalism, I actually call it nationism.
[01:11:17.769 --> 01:11:19.511]  We believe in the nation-state.
[01:11:20.152 --> 01:11:22.254]  That is the unit we identify with.
[01:11:22.515 --> 01:11:24.116]  That is what we feel part of.
[01:11:24.397 --> 01:11:26.739]  That is what we cheer for in the Olympics.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.224]  And if necessary, that is what we're prepared to fight for.
[01:11:31.385 --> 01:11:37.071]  It embodies our values, our families, our communities, our heritage, our identity.
[01:11:37.411 --> 01:11:38.132]  A globalist!
[01:11:39.153 --> 01:11:46.235]  ...is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much.
[01:11:47.095 --> 01:11:47.615]  And you know what?
[01:11:47.635 --> 01:11:48.556]  We can't have that.
[01:11:49.036 --> 01:11:50.076]  You know, they have a word.
[01:11:50.636 --> 01:11:52.317]  It sort of became old-fashioned.
[01:11:52.657 --> 01:11:54.317]  It's called a nationalist.
[01:11:54.837 --> 01:11:57.538]  And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word.
[01:11:57.578 --> 01:11:58.318]  You know what I am?
[01:11:58.338 --> 01:11:59.779]  I'm a nationalist, okay?
[01:12:00.299 --> 01:12:08.301]  It's obvious that nationalism seemed a simple explanation for where most Americans stand against the creeping tide of globalism.
[01:12:08.501 --> 01:12:15.442]  Protection of our values, security, and future against the efforts of international bankers and world government.
[01:12:15.682 --> 01:12:23.744]  However, the conniving mainstream media saw yet another opportunity to smear the president and anyone that agrees with him.
[01:12:23.844 --> 01:12:24.264]  Shocking.
[01:12:25.703 --> 01:12:26.004]  It is.
[01:12:26.044 --> 01:12:28.347]  We have a president who calls himself a nationalist.
[01:12:29.268 --> 01:12:29.909]  Nationalist.
[01:12:30.009 --> 01:12:31.992]  A loaded word for a lot of people.
[01:12:32.613 --> 01:12:41.385]  But the president dismissed any concern about it and sitting at his desk in the Oval Office defended the new label he is using for himself.
[01:12:42.106 --> 01:12:46.749]  I love our country and our country has taken second fiddle.
[01:12:46.789 --> 01:12:55.354]  There is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white nationalist.
[01:12:55.514 --> 01:12:56.475]  I've never even heard that.
[01:12:56.515 --> 01:12:57.596]  I cannot imagine that.
[01:12:57.956 --> 01:12:59.777]  You mean I say I'm a nationalist?
[01:12:59.797 --> 01:13:02.459]  No, I never heard that theory about being a nationalist.
[01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:08.880]  So now the Trump campaign has disavowed William Johnson and the white nationalist party that he runs.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:14.361]  But that has not stopped William Johnson from remaining a big-time fan of Donald Trump.
[01:13:14.381 --> 01:13:19.282]  President Trump has a ton of support from white nationalists, and that's a very different thing.
[01:13:19.663 --> 01:13:29.765]  Merriam-Webster's definition defines a white nationalist as one of a group of militant whites who espouse white supremacy and advocate enforced racial segregation.
[01:13:30.085 --> 01:13:31.085]  Even in Los Angeles,
[01:13:31.305 --> 01:13:35.548]  I think there's blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either.
[01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:47.742]  He is the most honest president since George Washington and the cherry tree.
[01:13:48.242 --> 01:13:50.524]  On the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist.
[01:13:50.564 --> 01:13:53.386]  Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists.
[01:13:53.426 --> 01:13:55.047]  Now people are also saying... I don't know why you'd say that.
[01:13:55.067 --> 01:13:56.068]  It's such a racist question.
[01:13:56.088 --> 01:14:01.732]  There are some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists because of your rhetoric.
[01:14:02.032 --> 01:14:02.773]  What do you make of that?
[01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:03.333]  I don't believe.
[01:14:03.373 --> 01:14:04.174]  I just, well, I don't know.
[01:14:04.214 --> 01:14:07.495]  Why do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African Americans?
[01:14:07.555 --> 01:14:09.676]  Why do I have among the highest poll numbers?
[01:14:10.076 --> 01:14:10.496]  Honestly?
[01:14:10.516 --> 01:14:13.197]  I mean, I know you have it written down and you're gonna tell me.
[01:14:13.618 --> 01:14:14.178]  Let me tell you.
[01:14:14.198 --> 01:14:15.378]  It's a racist question.
[01:14:15.999 --> 01:14:17.479]  They're assaulting reality.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.200]  We pay taxes.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.320]  It's our nation.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.201]  We have a system.
[01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:22.221]  We're proud of it.
[01:14:22.641 --> 01:14:24.022]  We protect our power globally.
[01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:24.942]  They go, no, no, no.
[01:14:25.402 --> 01:14:26.323]  You can't have a country.
[01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:28.724]  We gotta come in and take this over right now.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.161]  Who's taking it over?
[01:14:31.821 --> 01:14:32.401]  The IMF?
[01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:33.002]  The World Bank?
[01:14:33.042 --> 01:14:33.582]  The UN?
[01:14:34.082 --> 01:14:38.845]  The UN Human Rights Commission run by Saudi Arabia and China?
[01:14:39.365 --> 01:14:42.187]  It's like having Hitler run your local synagogue!
[01:14:42.427 --> 01:14:50.432]  And as populism becomes increasingly under attack, it came as no surprise that French President Macron, mouthpiece of the globalists,
[01:14:50.672 --> 01:14:56.896]  Chose to sour the commemoration of the Armistice Day Centennial observance in Paris with propaganda.
[01:14:57.156 --> 01:14:58.057]  Macron stated,
[01:15:20.872 --> 01:15:23.754]  But Macron didn't even bother to look up nationalism.
[01:15:24.034 --> 01:15:28.076]  Nationalism is described as a patriotic feeling.
[01:15:28.236 --> 01:15:34.359]  An extreme form of this is especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries.
[01:15:34.639 --> 01:15:39.321]  Nationalism advocates political independence for a particular country.
[01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:44.524]  So nationalism on its face is simply the opposite of globalism.
[01:15:44.764 --> 01:15:46.825]  Not the opposite of patriotism.
[01:15:47.085 --> 01:15:59.801]  There is no betrayal by American citizens here, but the desperation infused in the propaganda of the globalists knows no limits, twisting the meaning of words and reality on an international stage.
[01:16:00.062 --> 01:16:02.465]  And this is a very dangerous thing.
[01:16:02.865 --> 01:16:13.330]  As many of you know, we have just offered in the last few months the biggest sales in InfoWars history because the globalists have been trying to literally take our credit card processing away.
[01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.551]  They've been trying to hack our sites and bring them down.
[01:16:15.951 --> 01:16:17.932]  They have not been successful.
[01:16:18.512 --> 01:16:24.055]  Now a lot of times, other companies claim they have the best deals of the year on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.
[01:16:24.495 --> 01:16:26.376]  And it's been in the news that a lot of those are scams.
[01:16:26.696 --> 01:16:27.197]  We're good to go.
[01:16:45.052 --> 01:16:47.293]  And obviously you're funding the information war against the globalists.
[01:16:47.614 --> 01:16:48.734]  So it's a 360 win.
[01:16:49.114 --> 01:16:51.196]  Don't fight the traffic for Christmas shopping.
[01:16:51.856 --> 01:16:58.900]  Know you're supporting an organization and group that is absolutely driving the globalists crazy and raising the alarm worldwide.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:02.642]  It is a 360 win on this Black Friday.
[01:17:02.682 --> 01:17:04.183]  But the sale isn't just this Black Friday.
[01:17:04.744 --> 01:17:06.645]  Monday through next Sunday,
[01:17:07.245 --> 01:17:11.969]  We are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[01:17:12.389 --> 01:17:14.951]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, free shipping storewide.
[01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:16.192]  Let me read this to you.
[01:17:17.273 --> 01:17:21.116]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:17:22.543 --> 01:17:26.804]  In fact, this is even... Okay, this is the best sale ever.
[01:17:27.064 --> 01:17:32.166]  Because we're doing the sale from a while back that was the best ever, with the free Chevy 50% off, storewide.
[01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:38.027]  And double Patriot points, which normal Patriot point is 5%, and so now this is 10%.
[01:17:38.508 --> 01:17:41.108]  So this makes a bunch of these complete lost leaders.
[01:17:41.148 --> 01:17:41.808]  This is insane.
[01:17:42.429 --> 01:17:43.469]  Okay, so let me be clear here.
[01:17:44.369 --> 01:17:45.470]  And just put this out like this.
[01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:47.490]  It's so much to say, we'll just put it out.
[01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:48.730]  No teleprompters here.
[01:17:49.151 --> 01:17:49.831]  Black Friday.
[01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:55.815]  InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:17:56.816 --> 01:18:02.980]  All InfoWars life supplements, 50% off with the free shipping and the double Patriot points.
[01:18:03.761 --> 01:18:08.565]  Up to 50% off on storable food, super high quality, that is huge.
[01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.666]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[01:18:12.066 --> 01:18:13.466]  Oh, this is the one that is the best ever.
[01:18:13.486 --> 01:18:14.726]  I can say on Black Friday.
[01:18:14.746 --> 01:18:15.927]  We've been running this sale a few weeks.
[01:18:15.947 --> 01:18:19.427]  This is the best we've ever done.
[01:18:19.447 --> 01:18:23.068]  $127, or 49% off, Alexa Pure Pro Gravity Fed Filters.
[01:18:23.768 --> 01:18:25.149]  One of the best systems out there.
[01:18:25.489 --> 01:18:26.169]  Leading competitors, $300, $400.
[01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.829]  They usually retail at $240.
[01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:31.511]  Six, that's a great deal.
[01:18:31.971 --> 01:18:41.255]  We now have it at $127 because they ordered too many and want to, again, sell them out before the new year so they don't have to pay inventory tax to the feds and the state.
[01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:45.737]  Alexa Pure Breeze, air filtration, now at 40% off.
[01:18:45.797 --> 01:18:48.159]  That's right at Lost Leader, again, to get rid of inventory.
[01:18:48.359 --> 01:18:49.279]  So take advantage of that.
[01:18:49.299 --> 01:18:50.160]  It's an amazing system.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:57.163]  Also, there's a bunch of special sections where we've got other deals at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:18:57.503 --> 01:19:01.945]  Actually, now that I'm here, looking at this and thinking, this is the best deal we've ever done.
[01:19:01.985 --> 01:19:04.746]  So it actually tops the last deal.
[01:19:19.511 --> 01:19:30.818]  And you know what, just put this out like it is because it just shows how we're being transparent here and this is so insane that they're trying to shut down our credit card processors, they're trying to shut down InfoWars, they're trying to defund us.
[01:19:31.078 --> 01:19:33.880]  So I said everything must go by the end of the year.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:40.584]  All of our inventory I intend to have gone so that we're at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[01:19:41.104 --> 01:19:45.987]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:46.207 --> 01:19:52.030]  Support the InfoWars, get great products, get your Christmas shopping done early, and battle the globalists.
[01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.251]  A total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:54.271 --> 01:19:55.811]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:20:04.476 --> 01:20:10.379]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:25.758]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:26.139 --> 01:20:27.561]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:43.627 --> 01:20:46.068]  Well, I'm really excited to have Katie Hopkins in studio with us.
[01:20:46.088 --> 01:20:50.229]  She's also going to be on The War Room today, and I'm going to be interviewed for her show.
[01:20:50.569 --> 01:20:52.090]  She has Hopkinsworld.com.
[01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:53.790]  She also does reporting for Fox News.
[01:20:54.310 --> 01:21:00.993]  She, of course, has been a big popular writer for major British newspapers, with some of her videos getting tens of millions of views.
[01:21:01.033 --> 01:21:04.934]  That's why she's become so fired, just like InfoWars, if you're popular.
[01:21:05.774 --> 01:21:07.014]  And you're not saying what they want to hear.
[01:21:07.034 --> 01:21:14.616]  You're standing up for sovereignty and capitalism and you don't want, you know, Islamic acid attacks or grooming of kidnapped little girls.
[01:21:15.636 --> 01:21:16.136]  Well, you're bad.
[01:21:16.156 --> 01:21:17.056]  You've got to be taken off the air.
[01:21:17.096 --> 01:21:18.476]  But now she's come to America.
[01:21:18.516 --> 01:21:21.117]  But who knows how long we'll have free speech here as well.
[01:21:21.437 --> 01:21:26.898]  So Katie Hopkins, you were during the break, you were really saying some incredibly important things the way you were tying it together.
[01:21:27.498 --> 01:21:28.238]  So it's good to have you here.
[01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:29.559]  And please, please, please do it again.
[01:21:29.999 --> 01:21:30.859]  Thank you very much indeed.
[01:21:30.879 --> 01:21:31.779]  It's really good to be here.
[01:21:32.319 --> 01:21:35.221]  And it's really good to be here in studio with you as well.
[01:21:35.241 --> 01:21:39.343]  We've talked a number of times but it's good to finally meet a lot of the team members as well.
[01:21:39.383 --> 01:21:45.226]  But one of the things that's really striking for me, I've been out in LA for the last week or so with the midterms.
[01:21:45.807 --> 01:21:49.669]  One of the things that's really striking for me is the way that here in the States now
[01:21:50.209 --> 01:22:06.205]  You know, watching democracy be overturned, so in Florida the surprising result in Arizona, watching people overturn what seems to be a democratic vote and how that ties in with Brexit where 17.4 million people voted for something
[01:22:06.545 --> 01:22:08.667]  That probably will never see either.
[01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.389]  And it's kind of this idea of what do people expect?
[01:22:11.689 --> 01:22:29.583]  They scrap the idea of the true family, they remove your true identity of your country by flooding it with people from another place, and then they tell you to vote, you vote, and then they tell you your vote doesn't count, or your vote doesn't matter, or they just found some more ballots, so funnily enough you're not getting the guy that you voted for.
[01:22:29.943 --> 01:22:35.348]  You know, at what point do they expect people to still be able to believe in
[01:22:35.828 --> 01:22:37.970]  A system or the country they belong to.
[01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:45.437]  You know, we're trashing so much of what structures our lives and makes our lives feel like they have worth and value.
[01:22:46.258 --> 01:22:47.699]  And it's a global system.
[01:22:48.139 --> 01:22:50.962]  We have our controlled media saying Trump's evil.
[01:22:50.982 --> 01:22:52.183]  You can't say we're a nation.
[01:22:52.543 --> 01:22:53.825]  A nation existing is bad.
[01:22:53.925 --> 01:22:55.346]  You can't even have borders, it's bad.
[01:22:55.686 --> 01:22:57.108]  Macron comes out and says it.
[01:22:57.648 --> 01:23:09.711]  When it was the Vichy French that signed on to Hitler and the original EU plan and here he is this traitor saying that the Brits are bad or the UK is bad for wanting to get out of something you never voted to get into.
[01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:15.193]  You voted three years ago to leave and they won't let you leave and then magically it's happening here again.
[01:23:15.593 --> 01:23:19.954]  So the truth is the people are rejecting globalism and tyranny but it's become a tyranny.
[01:23:20.514 --> 01:23:26.676]  So let's walk through some of the parallels there because we're dealing whether it's the UK or whether it's
[01:23:27.596 --> 01:23:36.343]  Brazil, or whether it's the US, all of us are trying to get self-determination back from the modern corporate colonialism that's globalism.
[01:23:36.743 --> 01:23:54.137]  Yeah, absolutely, and I think one of the things we see every time, so if I think about Brexit, you know, we had the Brexit vote, Leave won, people like myself, you know, it was the best day ever, the 23rd of June 2016, the best night, because we had our voices heard for the first time.
[01:23:54.497 --> 01:23:58.220]  You know, this lovely country I come from, a place called the rest of the UK.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.942]  You know, the UK is divided into two places.
[01:24:00.982 --> 01:24:04.704]  There's London and there's this other great place called the rest of the UK.
[01:24:05.064 --> 01:24:08.847]  We had our voices heard for once and we celebrated.
[01:24:09.147 --> 01:24:15.071]  And ever since that night, ever since that win, it's been a court case to try and stop Brexit.
[01:24:15.192 --> 01:24:17.273]  It's been why we need to have another vote.
[01:24:17.293 --> 01:24:21.356]  There's this huge campaign called the People's Vote, which is a second referendum.
[01:24:22.096 --> 01:24:26.417]  And we've already voted once but they want us to vote again because we came up with the wrong answer.
[01:24:26.838 --> 01:24:32.779]  And watching this unfold in Florida as well where these ballot boxes, provisional ballots, are turning up.
[01:24:32.799 --> 01:24:37.721]  And it's a famous county that tries to steal any close election statewide.
[01:24:37.881 --> 01:24:46.147]  Yeah, of course, and it's unbelievable that somebody who's already been found guilty of election fraud is still there running this thing.
[01:24:46.427 --> 01:24:54.332]  It's unbelievable you have people trying to cover up for election boxes, ballot boxes turning up, you know, at airports in the back of cars by calling it a bomb.
[01:24:54.412 --> 01:24:55.933]  I mean, it's a craziness.
[01:24:56.013 --> 01:24:57.654]  It's a madness that we're suffering from.
[01:24:58.034 --> 01:25:07.241]  And it strikes me that America was always, you know, we all hold America up as this kind of, because you have the Constitution, we hold you up as this ambassador of
[01:25:08.101 --> 01:25:11.003]  Democracy, the leader of the free world.
[01:25:11.043 --> 01:25:16.207]  Well, our societal contract is based on this idea that we have law and order.
[01:25:16.247 --> 01:25:17.168]  And it's being broken.
[01:25:17.308 --> 01:25:19.109]  We comply to it because we have our vote.
[01:25:19.469 --> 01:25:21.010]  You want to take away my vote.
[01:25:21.271 --> 01:25:24.773]  Why am I now societally contracted in to obey law and order?
[01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:27.035]  You know, we are really messing with the system here.
[01:25:27.535 --> 01:25:29.936]  And let's talk about that because it's like you read my mind.
[01:25:30.317 --> 01:25:34.859]  I was literally about to say the social contract is broken and then you said it because it's prima facie.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.480]  We're not reading each other's minds.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:37.181]  It's the truth.
[01:25:37.221 --> 01:25:38.462]  We're seeing the same thing.
[01:25:38.482 --> 01:25:40.243]  And we've done our research.
[01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:44.145]  But if you look at what they're doing, clearly there's election fraud.
[01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:46.366]  The Democrats are saying, let illegal aliens vote.
[01:25:46.426 --> 01:25:52.470]  We're catching them all over Texas, all over the country, voting the names of dead people.
[01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:55.652]  Project Veritas gets the undercover video of all this and
[01:25:57.043 --> 01:26:02.328]  Then they say, oh, the Trump election is illegitimate, the Russians did it with no proof.
[01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:11.517]  We have them violating and stealing elections with total proof, but they say it's illegitimate and fascist and dangerous that Trump is saying there's clearly fraud.
[01:26:12.338 --> 01:26:13.459]  This is upside-down world.
[01:26:13.759 --> 01:26:19.765]  There's not even congruency that they're saying it's good to challenge elections with no proof, but with total proof, it's bad.
[01:26:20.626 --> 01:26:21.806]  And there's another thing as well.
[01:26:21.987 --> 01:26:33.951]  So not only do I see the parallels stretching from Western Europe or Britain to America in terms of the overturning of a popular vote as it appears to be happening in Florida, certainly I believe it's happened in Arizona personally.
[01:26:34.031 --> 01:26:34.491]  Oh absolutely.
[01:26:34.511 --> 01:26:36.672]  Because of the incongruency between the numbers.
[01:26:37.332 --> 01:26:42.934]  But I think the other thing that's really alarming to me as an outsider, it's the reason I spend so much time here in America,
[01:26:43.474 --> 01:26:46.775]  Is watching people vote according to religion.
[01:26:47.115 --> 01:26:53.178]  So for the first time you've had two Muslim females elected and they're going to be going to Congress.
[01:26:53.218 --> 01:26:53.778]  And explain that!
[01:26:53.858 --> 01:26:54.498]  Oh great!
[01:26:54.998 --> 01:26:57.899]  But they always vote as a bloc and then that's why they're so key.
[01:26:58.019 --> 01:26:59.720]  Yeah and that's the parallel that I would draw.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.801]  So we're a long way down that, you know, the UK has fallen.
[01:27:02.841 --> 01:27:06.602]  We're a long way down the dark path to some kind of holy hell.
[01:27:06.622 --> 01:27:09.824]  First they take your identity, then they bring in a absolute
[01:27:12.321 --> 01:27:14.523]  It's a tyrannical system that votes monolithically.
[01:27:14.743 --> 01:27:15.884]  There's no way you can stand against it.
[01:27:16.265 --> 01:27:18.146]  Well, I think, you know, there's sort of the stages.
[01:27:18.186 --> 01:27:19.868]  You can easily see them mapped out.
[01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:25.593]  So what you do is you flood an area with a one, a monoculture, the Muslim population.
[01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:27.174]  You'll see houses change.
[01:27:27.194 --> 01:27:32.899]  They used to have a single doorbell and now they have four or five doorbells because they've become multiple occupancy homes.
[01:27:32.939 --> 01:27:39.305]  You've got five families where there used to be one and that one family leave because they don't know where they are anymore because they're surrounded by a different culture.
[01:27:39.785 --> 01:27:46.029]  Once you have a Muslim population, they vote according to religion, because religion is the number one thing in their lives.
[01:27:46.089 --> 01:27:48.250]  And that means they vote how their political imam tells them.
[01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:48.890]  Correct.
[01:27:49.011 --> 01:27:58.376]  So you have a political imam, you see those mosques building up, where of course political Islam is pushed, and then you will see the baton being handed over from one Muslim to another.
[01:27:58.436 --> 01:28:07.261]  So it's a new kind of, you know, in our country we used to have this kind of generational, this aristocracy that used to pass down, whether that was right or wrong, that's how power was passed.
[01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:08.222]  You've traded one out
[01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:14.966]  That gave us the Magna Carta and gave us the Renaissance with one that gave us sex slavery and mass death.
[01:28:15.206 --> 01:28:19.868]  You have a new kind of succession planning going on right here in America, in Minnesota, in Michigan.
[01:28:19.888 --> 01:28:22.510]  I've spent a lot of time there trying to warn people.
[01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:30.534]  But once you start passing that baton from one Muslim leader to another, which you've done with Keith Ellison, straight over to the next one who married, potentially, allegedly, America's brother.
[01:28:30.554 --> 01:28:32.195]  And we're going to come back to this because this is key.
[01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:36.477]  They are totally monotheistic, a monoculture, let no one else in.
[01:28:36.877 --> 01:28:37.818]  And that's good and liberal.
[01:28:38.038 --> 01:28:48.624]  But everything Christian or Western, just the idea of liking the West and it works well, even if you're not a Christian, that's supposed to be thrown down the rat hole into the garbage.
[01:28:48.664 --> 01:28:51.406]  This is totally sick and it's totally planned.
[01:28:51.606 --> 01:28:53.848]  Kenny Hopkins is on fire in studio.
[01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:58.330]  Spread the live links and tell folks about local stations to get around the censors.
[01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:59.131]  It's a mission.
[01:29:03.246 --> 01:29:08.649]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[01:29:08.889 --> 01:29:10.450]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:11.090]  It's a good thing.
[01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:14.352]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[01:29:14.732 --> 01:29:17.073]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[01:29:17.113 --> 01:29:18.234]  I learned what the best was.
[01:29:18.614 --> 01:29:23.637]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[01:29:23.757 --> 01:29:24.297]  It's amazing.
[01:29:24.457 --> 01:29:26.820]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:33.728]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[01:29:33.888 --> 01:29:35.510]  He has a glut of them.
[01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:37.892]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[01:29:39.394 --> 01:29:42.535]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:43.195]  It's $127!
[01:29:43.935 --> 01:29:47.676]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[01:29:48.076 --> 01:29:49.857]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[01:29:50.197 --> 01:29:52.417]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[01:29:52.518 --> 01:29:53.038]  It's amazing.
[01:29:53.118 --> 01:29:59.159]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:21.676]  This vision of France as a generous nation, with a vision which carries universal values, has been, in those dark times, exactly the opposite of the selfishness of a people which only looks at its own interests.
[01:30:22.757 --> 01:30:26.201]  Because patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism.
[01:30:27.094 --> 01:30:30.395]  Nationalism is the opposite of patriotism.
[01:30:30.415 --> 01:30:32.556]  That's saying white is the opposite of white.
[01:30:32.936 --> 01:30:34.416]  Red is the opposite of red.
[01:30:34.937 --> 01:30:37.017]  Uh, you know, Hillary Clinton's in great shape.
[01:30:37.457 --> 01:30:37.918]  It's crazy.
[01:30:37.998 --> 01:30:38.218]  Yeah.
[01:30:38.438 --> 01:30:45.440]  And some background on Macron, I think is helpful because he sort of disappeared from nowhere and people just went, okay, he's the leader of France.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.160]  I'll accept that.
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:48.301]  But actually people need to really question
[01:30:49.041 --> 01:30:50.222]  Macron and his background.
[01:30:50.282 --> 01:30:53.964]  He's actually part of the intellectual elite, the establishment.
[01:30:54.284 --> 01:30:56.606]  He wormed his way to the position he's in.
[01:30:56.626 --> 01:30:57.346]  Well, let's say it.
[01:30:57.406 --> 01:31:00.808]  He was a pedophilic sex toy of the establishment.
[01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:01.929]  And that's on record.
[01:31:02.029 --> 01:31:07.172]  Look, Emmanuel Macron's Rothschild years make him an easy election target, Financial Times.
[01:31:07.752 --> 01:31:07.972]  Yes.
[01:31:08.333 --> 01:31:09.713]  So they know Macron.
[01:31:09.753 --> 01:31:13.996]  He's a special puppet to the point of literally shoving their arm at him and puppeting him.
[01:31:15.157 --> 01:31:20.961]  That's a strong way to put it, Mr. Jones, but I do think that Macron is a slime.
[01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:26.244]  You know, he has come from inside the very system that he pretends that he's against.
[01:31:26.644 --> 01:31:34.009]  Secondly, yes, he did marry his drama teacher, who's like 50 years older than him, and they were together at school when he was just a boy.
[01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:37.612]  And there is this really, when you see them together away from the cameras,
[01:31:38.012 --> 01:31:44.874]  She is a very, I mean, I'm quite an old lady, but she's a properly old lady and it's a very, very weird relationship and that tells you something about him.
[01:31:44.934 --> 01:31:48.035]  Also, he wears sparkly nail polish, not saying anything about that.
[01:31:48.095 --> 01:31:58.359]  But the other thing is I was there when he was elected because obviously I was in France to champion Marine Le Pen and champion the patriotic movement that was behind Marine Le Pen.
[01:31:58.439 --> 01:32:05.821]  But when he walked up to the stage, which was all set out for him to celebrate, as people like myself walked in, we were given t-shirts
[01:32:06.061 --> 01:32:07.702]  Um, to wear with him on them.
[01:32:07.742 --> 01:32:08.942]  We were given t-shirts to wear.
[01:32:09.002 --> 01:32:10.783]  This is him with the big black pyramid behind him.
[01:32:10.803 --> 01:32:12.464]  With a flashing red light behind him.
[01:32:12.564 --> 01:32:16.405]  As he walked up to the stage, he walked up to the EU anthem.
[01:32:16.505 --> 01:32:19.107]  He did not walk up to the French national anthem.
[01:32:19.127 --> 01:32:21.788]  And all of Marine Le Pen's stuff was the flying of the flag.
[01:32:22.128 --> 01:32:24.609]  He walked up to the EU national anthem.
[01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:27.950]  And why are the French buying into literally having their noses rubbed in?
[01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:29.071]  Is it a form of cuckolding?
[01:32:29.531 --> 01:32:34.694]  It's so weird, you know, so many voters are so, it drives me crazy, they're so lazy.
[01:32:34.734 --> 01:32:37.316]  They look at a picture and they go, oh does he look nice?
[01:32:37.596 --> 01:32:38.697]  Oh yeah, he looks quite nice.
[01:32:38.757 --> 01:32:39.658]  Would I have a drink with him?
[01:32:39.778 --> 01:32:40.838]  Oh yeah, I'd have a drink with him.
[01:32:40.999 --> 01:32:42.059]  And so they vote for him.
[01:32:42.179 --> 01:32:47.663]  He is such a slime and such a cheese ball and yet he has no authenticity and you can see it.
[01:32:47.723 --> 01:32:49.544]  You can see how shallow he is.
[01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.225]  You can see it when you look at him, I think.
[01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:52.826]  I mean, it's come out in the news.
[01:32:52.906 --> 01:32:55.688]  He's been a sex toy since he was 13 or 14.
[01:32:55.868 --> 01:32:58.450]  These elite parties she would take him to and that's how he went right to the
[01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:59.831]  All the way up, as it were.
[01:33:04.794 --> 01:33:10.758]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.239 --> 01:33:21.785]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.098 --> 01:33:39.499]  I'm watching the midterms.
[01:33:40.039 --> 01:33:43.420]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:47.582]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[01:33:51.563 --> 01:33:53.444]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:33:53.464 --> 01:33:55.205]  You want a drop?
[01:33:55.325 --> 01:34:04.149]  You want a drop?
[01:34:04.549 --> 01:34:05.549]  Yeah!
[01:34:06.089 --> 01:34:07.570]  I'm going to the president.
[01:34:11.165 --> 01:34:33.437]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[01:34:39.446 --> 01:34:41.588]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:34:42.088 --> 01:34:47.313]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:34:48.494 --> 01:34:51.476]  So, Katie Hopkins of Hopkins World, Fox News contributor.
[01:34:53.137 --> 01:34:59.242]  They have government-sponsored plays in the UK calling for her death, called the assassination of Katie Hopkins.
[01:34:59.883 --> 01:35:01.404]  This is par for the course for these people.
[01:35:01.424 --> 01:35:04.247]  It's like they called for violence here, and then said that we're calling for violence.
[01:35:04.267 --> 01:35:08.030]  So they said that President Trump is attacking the press when he points out they're lying about him.
[01:35:09.013 --> 01:35:16.640]  And then they're calling for me to be taken off the air and lobbying successfully to do it on over a hundred platforms.
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.141]  And now they want our banking.
[01:35:18.542 --> 01:35:20.103]  Now they want our software.
[01:35:20.563 --> 01:35:26.469]  Now they're contacting the software we use for the websites and saying, revoke the right to software, to contract.
[01:35:26.549 --> 01:35:27.530]  This is war.
[01:35:27.610 --> 01:35:28.230]  Katie Hopkins.
[01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:29.441]  Let's get
[01:35:48.084 --> 01:36:05.641]  You're getting into the voting, the new Islamic aristocracy, the two Islamic women, even though in their own countries they don't do that, being elected to Congress, flying their Palestinian flags at their victory events.
[01:36:06.101 --> 01:36:08.983]  One of them is a daughter of Palestinians.
[01:36:09.243 --> 01:36:19.128]  And when she was elected to Congress as the first Muslim to be elected to Congress, you know, what flag was it that she got out and what flag was it that she decided to fly first?
[01:36:19.168 --> 01:36:21.149]  Of course, the Palestinian flag.
[01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:23.991]  And people celebrate because they say, wow, isn't it fantastic?
[01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:26.292]  We've got another Muslim woman going to Congress.
[01:36:26.332 --> 01:36:29.194]  But for me, of course, those are where the warning bells
[01:36:29.614 --> 01:36:45.878]  Well they're not just ringing, the whole system, I know this system, I've lived it in the UK, you have a Muslim in power, suddenly the Muslim population of that area which is a dense and a monoculture right there with mosques that facilitate them, you have them voting according to their religion.
[01:36:46.278 --> 01:36:54.300]  What happens next of course is that police start turning a blind eye, you have no-go zones where police actively don't patrol.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.501]  Where black money starts to flow in through unregistered mosques.
[01:36:58.561 --> 01:37:00.402]  I've seen it happen on the streets.
[01:37:00.422 --> 01:37:06.403]  Everybody knows that they have, in the Islamic culture, sex slavery.
[01:37:07.004 --> 01:37:10.485]  And they call it a harem, but it's kidnapped women, it's kidnapped children.
[01:37:11.105 --> 01:37:21.488]  And this is the process, and Islam is only 1400 years old, and there are countries that were free, now they're Islamic, like Turkey was the
[01:37:23.078 --> 01:37:24.079]  Eastern Christian Empire.
[01:37:24.179 --> 01:37:24.859]  It's gone now.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.441]  And it's the new invasion force.
[01:37:26.501 --> 01:37:30.584]  So there's the house of Islam and there's the house of war outside of it.
[01:37:30.604 --> 01:37:33.926]  There's that, but I think there's also it's far more sophisticated than that.
[01:37:33.966 --> 01:37:39.170]  You know, I don't really focus so much on the female element, though clearly that is abhorrent.
[01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:42.032]  But when you watch them on the streets of Belgium,
[01:37:42.452 --> 01:37:52.721]  There's the garages, the car washes, there's the unofficial mosques and then there's these reception places where they pretend to host things but actually it's a way of laundering money.
[01:37:53.081 --> 01:38:03.029]  The movement of drugs and weapons and money through those areas which are controlled by the Muslims where police no longer patrol because the imams control who can patrol
[01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:06.052]  Oh, ambulances and mail won't even get delivered in Sweden and Germany.
[01:38:06.333 --> 01:38:16.865]  Yeah, precisely my point is that the takeover is far more sinister and far more... It's a takeover of the entire society, the culture, and they're lawless because everyone outside of their culture is the enemy.
[01:38:17.205 --> 01:38:18.006]  Right, and where you end up?
[01:38:18.126 --> 01:38:37.170]  What you end up with is in Belgium you have the Islam Party and that's what you will see in years from now in Minnesota in Michigan there will be the establishment of the Islam Party and in Belgium they have two candidates that were elected and their policies were segregation on transport and their policies were compulsory headscarves for all.
[01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:45.912]  That's the route that Michigan and Minnesota are headed down and that's the route that the Democrats seem to be applauding and as an outsider and as a Brit I find it truly alarming.
[01:38:47.452 --> 01:38:56.200]  And to watch the left, in the name of diversity, bring in something that's the opposite of diversity as a total mono-tyranny, it's mind-blowing.
[01:38:56.601 --> 01:39:09.553]  It is mind-blowing, and you always hope that at some point the lizard, if I think of Democrats, which I prefer to as lizards, you hope one day that they'll spin so fast that their head will eat the tail, you know, and they'll die from blood loss to the head.
[01:39:09.873 --> 01:39:20.116]  And when I think of examples of this, I think of the trans movement where we just had the World Track Cycling Championship won by a trans woman who's obviously a former male.
[01:39:20.476 --> 01:39:24.537]  And now we're going to get to the point where women, I think you had it in Connecticut, the state championships too.
[01:39:24.898 --> 01:39:26.318]  Two of those races, the 100 and 200.
[01:39:26.538 --> 01:39:29.619]  And let's be clear, these people still have their testicles.
[01:39:29.839 --> 01:39:29.999]  Yeah.
[01:39:30.079 --> 01:39:36.741]  I mean, these are men and they have twice the strength, bigger bones, more blood, less fat.
[01:39:36.801 --> 01:39:38.042]  I mean, men and women are different.
[01:39:38.062 --> 01:39:38.842]  Smaller brains.
[01:39:39.482 --> 01:39:41.964]  Well, sure, and we don't have a uterus.
[01:39:42.484 --> 01:39:43.906]  So there's a big difference.
[01:39:43.926 --> 01:39:44.726]  I mean, look at this guy.
[01:39:45.287 --> 01:39:48.329]  I mean, this is a big... He's not going to compete against Lance Armstrong.
[01:39:48.569 --> 01:39:52.292]  Oh, but when Lance Armstrong enhances his maleness to win, that's called cheating.
[01:39:52.332 --> 01:39:58.077]  So when this guy goes up against girls... Alex, you've got to point out that the lady in the middle is called Rachel.
[01:39:58.838 --> 01:40:03.862]  So just for your viewers to be clear, that lady in the middle is called Rachel.
[01:40:04.602 --> 01:40:10.304]  And one of them, one of the women second place now says she's mad and she was cheated but then they got mad at her so she apologized.
[01:40:10.344 --> 01:40:11.944]  So she wrote back yeah on that.
[01:40:12.184 --> 01:40:18.566]  But we're now at the point of course where you have to say well the big thing for the Liberals or the Democrats was women are equal, women are all equal.
[01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:22.547]  Well okay but how are we equal now if we can't compete?
[01:40:22.647 --> 01:40:24.928]  How are we equal if we can't run as fast?
[01:40:24.988 --> 01:40:26.868]  How are we equal if men are against us?
[01:40:26.928 --> 01:40:27.448]  How is that?
[01:40:27.768 --> 01:40:29.429]  You know this is total mental illness.
[01:40:30.269 --> 01:40:30.429]  Yeah.
[01:40:30.449 --> 01:40:43.494]  It's like in the UK where the guy with the big beard comes in and the nurse said a huge you know male genitals and he's got he gets up and says check my cervix and then she won't go okay let me he doesn't have a cervix and so what she got suspended.
[01:40:43.834 --> 01:40:46.254]  Yeah and we have that with waxing parlors too.
[01:40:46.314 --> 01:40:53.817]  We have a trans individual in Europe who is suing waxing parlors because they wouldn't wax him as a female.
[01:40:54.057 --> 01:40:56.338]  And they're trying to say let adult
[01:40:58.027 --> 01:41:03.172]  Men who say they're women shower with young girls because they'll be the girl's coach.
[01:41:03.953 --> 01:41:04.914]  She's a woman.
[01:41:04.974 --> 01:41:05.495]  No, she's not.
[01:41:06.055 --> 01:41:11.881]  And Chris Cuomo said it's bigoted if you don't want your 12-year-old daughter to see a woman's penis.
[01:41:13.263 --> 01:41:14.764]  That's 2 plus 2 equals whatever.
[01:41:15.045 --> 01:41:15.866]  That's mental illness.
[01:41:16.166 --> 01:41:17.788]  A woman's genitals.
[01:41:18.448 --> 01:41:19.029]  It's true.
[01:41:19.289 --> 01:41:26.494]  And we have men now that identify as women who are now being put in prisons with our female population because they now identify as a woman.
[01:41:26.834 --> 01:41:34.079]  And then we had a newspaper report recently where the women in the prison were violated by the other lady's penis.
[01:41:34.399 --> 01:41:36.360]  And that was actually written in a newspaper.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:37.141]  Let's be clear.
[01:41:38.368 --> 01:41:41.869]  A woman raped another woman with her penis.
[01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:43.569]  This is a family show.
[01:41:43.869 --> 01:41:46.010]  This is what they're teaching your five-year-olds right now.
[01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:47.470]  Total mental illness.
[01:41:47.971 --> 01:41:49.391]  But this is societal sabotage.
[01:41:49.671 --> 01:41:51.451]  You know, Tavistock Institute cooked all this up.
[01:41:51.491 --> 01:41:51.992]  You know about that.
[01:41:52.012 --> 01:41:52.512]  Yes, of course.
[01:41:53.712 --> 01:41:56.953]  So you hope they'll get to the point where even they have to go, hold on,
[01:41:57.253 --> 01:41:58.835]  We've gone a bit too far with this now.
[01:41:58.895 --> 01:42:03.000]  The point that women can't compete in a race anymore because men are in the race and that's not good.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.882]  But they still don't wake up to it.
[01:42:04.922 --> 01:42:09.128]  It's almost like they carry on building on the madness to the point they still can't compete.
[01:42:09.348 --> 01:42:10.489]  It's the Emperor's new clothes.
[01:42:10.649 --> 01:42:16.737]  Once they get you, like Hitler did, to sign on to something really bad, once you've signed on to it, you'll just keep by approximation.
[01:42:16.957 --> 01:42:23.940]  And you know the other thing, Alex, even though I would say that, look, you chop the legs off a cat, it doesn't become a slug, right?
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.240]  Like the analogy goes.
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:30.342]  But I don't even mind if you, Alex, want to be Alexandra for the rest of your life.
[01:42:30.543 --> 01:42:31.743]  I don't care if you want to hate people.
[01:42:31.763 --> 01:42:34.124]  I don't hate those people, but it's when you use it against kids.
[01:42:34.224 --> 01:42:42.828]  Yeah, well, if you tell me I have to believe that you're now Alexandra, I don't mind if you want to be, you know, Vera, the Vietnamese guy who's having some fucking suck it.
[01:42:42.848 --> 01:42:44.209]  I could be a beautiful, ornate building.
[01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.929]  I don't mind.
[01:42:44.949 --> 01:42:46.230]  I could be a beautiful, ornate building.
[01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:47.570]  Don't ask me to believe it.
[01:42:48.411 --> 01:42:52.173]  Yeah, I can believe 2 plus 2 equals 10, but you're saying, no, I'm not going to believe that.
[01:42:52.193 --> 01:42:53.513]  Well, Katie Hopkins, you're a bigot.
[01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:56.575]  Because 2 plus 2 does equal 10, and I'm a beautiful, golden, ornate building.
[01:42:56.935 --> 01:43:00.897]  As a Google exec makes his employees call him that, I am a beautiful, ornate, golden building.
[01:43:02.457 --> 01:43:03.018]  You know why?
[01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:06.031]  I love President Trump so much.
[01:43:07.292 --> 01:43:09.253]  It's because I know he's for real.
[01:43:09.833 --> 01:43:10.974]  He's trying the best he can.
[01:43:11.314 --> 01:43:15.156]  He's gotten so much done despite the enemies arrayed against him.
[01:43:15.937 --> 01:43:20.880]  And I've been really persecuted at a level we've never experienced before.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:24.402]  50 times the level I've ever experienced.
[01:43:25.143 --> 01:43:27.865]  The demonization, the lies, the harassment, the fake lawsuits.
[01:43:28.726 --> 01:43:29.667]  Because I've supported Trump.
[01:43:30.708 --> 01:43:31.269]  Now why is that?
[01:43:31.529 --> 01:43:37.715]  It's because Trump supports the idea of the nation-state, a pro-human future, not a globalist technocracy.
[01:43:38.496 --> 01:43:39.738]  And he really does love this country.
[01:43:40.238 --> 01:43:50.529]  And nation-states stand in the way of mega-corporations allied with authoritarian regimes like China and the EU dominating and oppressing and controlling populations.
[01:43:51.090 --> 01:43:54.914]  These people lust after controlling and running our lives.
[01:43:55.014 --> 01:43:56.216]  They want power.
[01:43:56.816 --> 01:44:04.298]  I just wanted to state here, with this being the week of Thanksgiving, that I am extremely thankful for President Trump, and I stand with President Trump.
[01:44:05.259 --> 01:44:08.640]  And I'm also extremely thankful to all of you out there.
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:12.641]  And I'm appreciative of you, and I love you, and I want to thank you.
[01:44:13.321 --> 01:44:16.502]  And I'm very, very humble for the support and the prayers.
[01:44:17.322 --> 01:44:39.915]  For all of you that have stood with them for wars over the years and put up with my annex sometimes when I get off the rails, none of us are perfect, and I just want you to know that we are all unified in our love of God, our love of justice, our love of freedom, our love of the rule of law, our love of sovereignty, and this great experience of human life we're all experiencing together and the long saga, the long march of humanity towards freedom.
[01:44:40.935 --> 01:44:44.160]  And the last 144 years of the American experience.
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:46.423]  What our ancestors have gone through together.
[01:44:46.443 --> 01:44:49.026]  America's destiny is very, very special.
[01:44:50.007 --> 01:44:51.549]  So no matter where you are in the world or...
[01:44:52.645 --> 01:44:53.345]  We're good to go.
[01:45:18.158 --> 01:45:28.864]  Delicate balance between being loving and being open and wanting to help people and being deceived and manipulated by bad people to end up doing evil things.
[01:45:29.684 --> 01:45:36.908]  But with Trump and with the American people and what you see with nationalism and patriotism and Christianity reawakening around the world,
[01:45:37.168 --> 01:45:38.929]  It's a very, very, very special time.
[01:45:39.809 --> 01:45:40.689]  And this is real.
[01:45:41.009 --> 01:45:42.350]  And we're all in this together.
[01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:46.871]  And Trump is fighting to deliver and to not betray.
[01:45:47.191 --> 01:45:49.812]  But he's not perfect, and he can't act alone.
[01:45:50.152 --> 01:45:51.593]  He can't do this on his own.
[01:45:52.093 --> 01:45:54.274]  And so we shouldn't be two-faced, any of us.
[01:45:55.354 --> 01:46:01.597]  We're friends and family and neighbors and virtue signal when they attack Trump and throw him under the bus.
[01:46:02.018 --> 01:46:12.143]  We have to stand up for Trump when that happens because he is a microcosm or an archetype or a figurehead of the spirit of resistance and who we are.
[01:46:12.823 --> 01:46:18.086]  And when we don't sit there and deny the fact that we respect and love him,
[01:46:18.886 --> 01:46:19.847]  It gives the enemy power.
[01:46:19.867 --> 01:46:24.650]  So we have to stand and be strong in the face of these bullies and say, we're not backing down.
[01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:26.291]  And you have supported InfoWars.
[01:46:26.811 --> 01:46:27.772]  You've made it all possible.
[01:46:28.512 --> 01:46:31.134]  And so I want to thank all of you out there for what you've done.
[01:46:31.154 --> 01:46:33.235]  And I want to remind some of those out there that get depressed.
[01:46:33.315 --> 01:46:34.176]  I know I do sometimes.
[01:46:34.676 --> 01:46:35.757]  This is a long journey.
[01:46:38.238 --> 01:46:40.420]  Good ruling this planet is not going to be easy.
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:43.783]  That's why it's the Animated Contest of Liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[01:46:43.823 --> 01:46:45.364]  But we've done incredible things.
[01:46:45.544 --> 01:46:46.745]  We've come from way behind.
[01:46:47.105 --> 01:46:48.987]  Now the enemy's launching their counter-assault.
[01:46:50.088 --> 01:46:51.629]  And we're living in history right now.
[01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.850]  God bless you all.
[01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:53.911]  Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.
[01:46:54.331 --> 01:46:56.332]  And again, thank you all for your support of InfoWars.
[01:47:05.037 --> 01:47:11.002]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.551 --> 01:47:27.615]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.637 --> 01:47:32.899]  There must be some way out of here.
[01:47:34.338 --> 01:47:49.784]  Say the joker to the thief There's too much confusion I can't get no relief Businessmen, they drink my wine Clown me
[01:47:56.114 --> 01:48:03.901]  We are being conquered by megacorporations that have looked at the demographics of six plus billion people in the third world, and they're using them as weapons.
[01:48:04.521 --> 01:48:09.546]  And then Macron is repeating the EU project that literally was launched by the Nazis.
[01:48:10.407 --> 01:48:16.332]  The French military stood down under orders by their generals, who then moved down to Vichy France and ran things.
[01:48:16.852 --> 01:48:18.774]  It was a Marshall Tito or whatever his name was.
[01:48:19.494 --> 01:48:21.016]  And now they're repeating it.
[01:48:21.076 --> 01:48:21.916]  Macron is saying,
[01:48:22.711 --> 01:48:30.635]  You know, you need to be open, you need to blah blah blah, to be looted by the globalists who, people like Bono, pays less than 1% of the money he raises for Africa to it.
[01:48:30.895 --> 01:48:39.800]  These are all monsters, the EU bureaucrats don't pay taxes, and now they're telling the UK that never voted to be in the EU that they have to stay in.
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:44.122]  What about this EU army, and just the arrogance, and Macron saying,
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.782]  Nationalism is the opposite of patriotism.
[01:48:47.802 --> 01:48:49.904]  That's saying white is the opposite of white.
[01:48:50.304 --> 01:48:51.725]  Red is the opposite of red.
[01:48:52.486 --> 01:48:54.408]  You know, Hillary Clinton's in great shape.
[01:48:54.848 --> 01:48:55.309]  It's crazy.
[01:48:55.389 --> 01:49:02.835]  Yeah, and some background on Macron I think is helpful because he sort of disappeared from nowhere and people just went, okay, he's the leader of France.
[01:49:02.916 --> 01:49:03.456]  I'll accept that.
[01:49:03.796 --> 01:49:07.599]  But actually, people need to really question Macron and his background.
[01:49:07.639 --> 01:49:11.342]  He's actually part of the intellectual elite, the establishment.
[01:49:11.662 --> 01:49:13.964]  He wormed his way to the position he's in.
[01:49:14.004 --> 01:49:14.705]  Well, let's say it.
[01:49:14.785 --> 01:49:18.207]  He was a pedophilic sex toy of the establishment.
[01:49:18.268 --> 01:49:19.148]  And that's on record.
[01:49:19.509 --> 01:49:24.532]  Look, Emmanuel Macron's Rothschild years make him an easy election target, Financial Times.
[01:49:25.133 --> 01:49:25.353]  Yes.
[01:49:25.713 --> 01:49:27.094]  So they know Macron.
[01:49:27.134 --> 01:49:31.358]  He's a special puppet, to the point of literally shoving their arm at him and puppeting him.
[01:49:33.246 --> 01:49:39.029]  That's a strong way to put it, Mr Jones, but I do think that Macron is a sly.
[01:49:39.089 --> 01:49:44.331]  You know, he has come from inside the very system that he pretends that he's against.
[01:49:44.731 --> 01:49:51.995]  Secondly, yes, he did marry his drama teacher, who's like 50 years older than him, and they were together at school when he was just a boy.
[01:49:52.475 --> 01:50:02.958]  And there is this really, when you see them together away from the cameras, she is a very, I mean, I'm quite an old lady, but she's a properly old lady and it's a very, very weird relationship and that tells you something about him.
[01:50:03.318 --> 01:50:06.599]  Also, he wears sparkly nail polish, not saying anything about that.
[01:50:07.099 --> 01:50:15.162]  Well, the issue is, is that he is a, I mean, it's come out in the news, he is a, he's been a sex toy since he was 13 or 14.
[01:50:15.582 --> 01:50:18.403]  These elite parties she would take him to and that's how he went right to the top.
[01:50:19.042 --> 01:50:20.423]  All the way up, as it were.
[01:50:20.884 --> 01:50:31.974]  And the other thing is I was there when he was elected because obviously I was in France to champion Marine Le Pen and champion the patriotic movement that was behind Marine Le Pen.
[01:50:32.535 --> 01:50:35.778]  And actually there was a slim chance at one point that she might actually pull it off.
[01:50:35.818 --> 01:50:36.679]  And she's in the lead again!
[01:50:36.879 --> 01:50:38.260]  I know, it's just so exciting.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:39.041]  I'm very excited.
[01:50:39.061 --> 01:50:40.122]  Wow, she's a smart lady.
[01:50:40.322 --> 01:50:50.332]  But when he walked up to the stage, which was all set up for him to celebrate, as people like myself walked in, we were given t-shirts to wear with him on them.
[01:50:50.372 --> 01:50:51.593]  We were given t-shirts to wear.
[01:50:51.613 --> 01:50:53.555]  This is him with the big black pyramid behind him.
[01:50:53.635 --> 01:50:55.877]  Oh yeah, it was all, the staging was huge.
[01:50:55.897 --> 01:50:59.901]  A show of Macron's inauguration, a big black pyramid with a flashing red light behind him.
[01:51:00.001 --> 01:51:04.045]  As he walked up to the stage, he walked up to the EU anthem.
[01:51:04.545 --> 01:51:10.146]  He did not walk up to the French National Anthem and all of Marine Le Pen's stuff was the flying of the flag.
[01:51:10.446 --> 01:51:12.566]  He walked up to the EU National Anthem.
[01:51:12.626 --> 01:51:16.287]  And why are the French buying into literally having their noses rubbed in?
[01:51:16.327 --> 01:51:17.427]  Is it a form of cuckolding?
[01:51:17.847 --> 01:51:18.447]  It's so weird.
[01:51:18.487 --> 01:51:22.268]  You know, so many voters are so... It drives me crazy.
[01:51:22.288 --> 01:51:23.028]  They're so lazy.
[01:51:23.068 --> 01:51:25.669]  They look at a picture and they go, oh, does he look nice?
[01:51:25.929 --> 01:51:27.009]  Oh yeah, he looks quite nice.
[01:51:27.029 --> 01:51:28.009]  Would I have a drink with him?
[01:51:28.329 --> 01:51:29.409]  Oh yeah, I'd have a drink with him.
[01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:31.870]  And then they think, oh, I wouldn't have a drink with Marine Le Pen.
[01:51:32.170 --> 01:51:33.190]  And so they vote for him.
[01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:39.034]  He is such a slime and such a cheese ball and yet he has no authenticity and you can see it.
[01:51:39.094 --> 01:51:41.116]  You can see how shallow he is.
[01:51:41.156 --> 01:51:42.817]  You can see it when you look at him, I think.
[01:51:43.337 --> 01:51:57.087]  But when I saw him, he's so unimpressive whereas Marine Le Pen's support is so deep, is so authentic, is so grounded and she's been in this for such a long time and her partnered with Salvini from Italy is just a glorious thing.
[01:51:57.107 --> 01:51:59.049]  What does that do to the globalists that from
[01:51:59.489 --> 01:52:07.115]  Brazil to Italy, everywhere where you get a vote, people say, yeah, we don't want to be run by some, you know, shadowy group who we don't even know who they are.
[01:52:07.435 --> 01:52:08.276]  It's so exciting.
[01:52:08.356 --> 01:52:15.862]  So there's a part of me coming from Western Europe, coming from the UK, that is so, it's like standing in a cold shower, like I just have to endure it.
[01:52:15.942 --> 01:52:18.324]  A bit like you have to endure the treatment you receive.
[01:52:20.005 --> 01:52:22.287]  It's an endurance struggle that we're part of here.
[01:52:22.327 --> 01:52:23.848]  We're all in for the fight.
[01:52:24.268 --> 01:52:38.699]  But when you see these movements, I was in Germany for the most recent elections where Merkel ended up having to stand down, where the AFD were triumphant, where the leader of the Greens has just said that the horde of invading migrants was one of the worst mistakes we've made in history.
[01:52:38.739 --> 01:52:40.260]  That's from the Green Party leader.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:48.282]  And when you see Salvini so resurgent and you see Marine Le Pen coming back on form, there is something so exciting going on.
[01:52:48.322 --> 01:53:01.265]  And Poland, Poland, if you saw the parade in Poland for Independence Day, 250,000 people and people like me... Well they get it because they've been overrun by Hitler, they've been overrun by the Russians, they've been overrun by the Islamists.
[01:53:01.325 --> 01:53:04.166]  They have it in their DNA that they've been overrun a bunch.
[01:53:04.326 --> 01:53:08.329]  They're so brilliant and so they're so... I interviewed the leader of the Law and Order Party.
[01:53:08.649 --> 01:53:11.211]  You know it's the safest place in Europe to be a woman.
[01:53:11.631 --> 01:53:21.118]  It's the place in Europe where they've never had a terrorist attack in Poland and that day after 250,000 people marched in the street, people took pictures of the street.
[01:53:21.418 --> 01:53:22.619]  They were immaculate.
[01:53:22.939 --> 01:53:27.863]  Nothing damaged, nothing burnt, nothing spoiled, no vehicles damaged.
[01:53:28.123 --> 01:53:30.424]  Respectful Christian culture.
[01:53:30.484 --> 01:53:33.727]  They will be the Israel for the Christian culture.
[01:53:33.787 --> 01:53:34.087]  They will
[01:53:34.507 --> 01:53:44.960]  You've got Germans and others fleeing to Eastern Europe now because the West is so dead in the West that we're now re-finding what's left of the West in the East.
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:51.688]  Of course, Israel will be the home for the Jewish people who are persecuted, being persecuted right now as we speak by rockets from
[01:53:52.028 --> 01:53:59.852]  Oh, if the globalists win and America is overtaken, I will have to go with my family 10, 15, 20 years from now to whatever doubt or refuge there is for Christians.
[01:53:59.992 --> 01:54:01.533]  Yeah, and there will be this sense.
[01:54:01.573 --> 01:54:02.914]  We see it in South Africa.
[01:54:03.194 --> 01:54:09.177]  The South African whites, there's only, you know, they say there's only two more years that we will have whites in South Africa.
[01:54:09.557 --> 01:54:12.239]  They are pulling back to a defendable territory.
[01:54:12.519 --> 01:54:14.560]  They are prepared to make a last stand.
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:16.021]  They talk of dying in their boots.
[01:54:16.141 --> 01:54:17.121]  And we will do the same.
[01:54:17.181 --> 01:54:18.062]  We will pull back
[01:54:18.502 --> 01:54:23.665]  To a last stand, a defendable territory, and I think that would be Poland, Hungary, Eastern Europe.
[01:54:23.765 --> 01:54:25.986]  And let's be clear, then all the civilization will collapse.
[01:54:26.026 --> 01:54:28.707]  It's not even the minorities that want this in the West.
[01:54:28.767 --> 01:54:29.768]  Islam does want to take over.
[01:54:30.428 --> 01:54:34.830]  It's our own globalist elites that come out of the West that want to sacrifice the West
[01:54:37.191 --> 01:54:38.872]  Because the idea of freedom threatens them.
[01:54:38.892 --> 01:54:41.513]  They're literally betting that they can defeat freedom.
[01:54:41.753 --> 01:54:43.253]  This is World War 4.
[01:54:43.734 --> 01:54:44.094]  It is.
[01:54:44.274 --> 01:54:53.297]  And it is, I think, not widely acknowledged or not acknowledged enough that it's equally profitable to manage the decline of a country.
[01:54:53.337 --> 01:54:54.197]  People always say, why?
[01:54:54.277 --> 01:54:55.677]  Why does Britain let it go?
[01:54:55.957 --> 01:55:03.700]  It's easier and more profitable to manage the decline of the country and take the money from the Saudis for another mosque than it is to try and defend or rebuke
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:16.451]  There's a bunch of weaklings and sellouts that only care about now, but above that there's the really evil globalists and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the Soros's of the world who said he wants to overthrow Israel.
[01:55:16.691 --> 01:55:24.318]  But there are these people that really want to destroy anything that's, you know, ancient Judaic or ancient Christian.
[01:55:24.478 --> 01:55:25.199]  They're threatened by it.
[01:55:25.459 --> 01:55:42.321]  Absolutely, and that's why we've seen in the Outer Hebrides, which I was just looking for a map, but off the coast of Scotland, so the furthest northerly point of Scotland, the most far north that you can go, the islands off the coast of Scotland, so literally the middle of nowhere, a new mega mosque.
[01:55:42.441 --> 01:55:44.942]  Has just been planned for one of those islands.
[01:55:45.082 --> 01:55:46.323]  These are planted flags.
[01:55:46.343 --> 01:55:49.724]  These are like alien motherships landing and disgorging their troops.
[01:55:49.964 --> 01:55:52.005]  And that was known as the sort of Catholic heartland.
[01:55:52.025 --> 01:55:57.848]  That was known as the place where Christianity was sort of... And this current Pope says don't investigate pedophilia in the U.S.
[01:55:57.888 --> 01:55:58.828]  Shut down investigations.
[01:55:58.848 --> 01:56:00.989]  He ordered them today or last night to do that.
[01:56:01.369 --> 01:56:03.330]  And he's the one saying open Europe up.
[01:56:03.370 --> 01:56:07.432]  He gets nauseated, close quote, when he hears about our Christian roots in Europe.
[01:56:08.152 --> 01:56:09.193]  What's going on with this guy?
[01:56:09.333 --> 01:56:12.255]  Yeah, the Pope's a crazy individual and it really concerns me.
[01:56:12.275 --> 01:56:18.460]  I see it with the Pope, I see it with a number of rabbis that come from the left side of the equation.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:29.788]  Rabbis who will, who know that actually, and I'm such a supporter of Israel and the rights of Jews to have a homeland, and yet there are these rabbis in Western Europe that encourage the Muslims to come because they believe this kind of thing.
[01:56:29.808 --> 01:56:35.572]  And let's be clear, how many times did the Muslims get to the gates of the Vatican and sack Rome, but the Vatican's hundred foot walls
[01:56:36.152 --> 01:56:37.393]  Stopped him.
[01:56:37.753 --> 01:56:41.195]  And he's literally trying to kill what's left of Christendom.
[01:56:41.535 --> 01:56:41.955]  I think so.
[01:56:41.995 --> 01:56:52.921]  And I think one of the interesting things about being minorities is that in South Africa, if you think of the white farmers, even when they're a minority, they're only a tiny percentage of the population, they still don't gain any rights.
[01:56:53.261 --> 01:56:59.745]  You know the Vatican will end up being a mosque, just like the Blue Mosque was formerly the big church in Istanbul, formerly Constantinople.
[01:56:59.765 --> 01:57:00.225]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:57:00.345 --> 01:57:00.845]  No, you're good.
[01:57:01.125 --> 01:57:02.286]  Interrupt is what you do, partly.
[01:57:02.486 --> 01:57:03.467]  I'm famous for it.
[01:57:03.487 --> 01:57:03.947]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:03.987 --> 01:57:04.908]  That's what you take when you come.
[01:57:04.928 --> 01:57:05.728]  No, I do a little too much.
[01:57:05.748 --> 01:57:06.729]  But no, I mean, I was seeing that.
[01:57:06.789 --> 01:57:07.609]  That will be a mosque.
[01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:09.910]  I mean, the Vatican will be a big, giant mosque.
[01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:11.351]  What will they call it?
[01:57:11.471 --> 01:57:14.453]  They'll call it the Great, the Grand Mosque of Rome.
[01:57:14.473 --> 01:57:15.033]  That's it.
[01:57:15.153 --> 01:57:18.855]  Because in Belgium, we have the Grand Mosque of Brussels.
[01:57:19.175 --> 01:57:23.978]  There's always a title that kind of links it implicitly to the area it's located in.
[01:57:24.018 --> 01:57:28.761]  And the Grand Mosque of Brussels was given rent-free for 100 years to the Saudis.
[01:57:29.321 --> 01:57:32.663]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[01:58:00.467 --> 01:58:02.028]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[01:58:02.068 --> 01:58:02.669]  It's a good thing.
[01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:05.912]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[01:58:06.472 --> 01:58:08.894]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[01:58:08.914 --> 01:58:09.995]  I learned what the best was.
[01:58:10.695 --> 01:58:23.926]  An Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[01:58:24.447 --> 01:58:29.411]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[01:58:29.571 --> 01:58:34.016]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[01:58:34.516 --> 01:58:36.879]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[01:58:37.559 --> 01:58:41.944]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[01:58:43.613 --> 01:58:45.313]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[01:58:46.074 --> 01:58:48.354]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[01:58:48.374 --> 01:58:55.776]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming, and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[01:58:55.796 --> 01:58:58.217]  $25,000 car, you probably pay $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[01:58:58.357 --> 01:59:00.597]  And that's not counting state taxes.
[01:59:00.617 --> 01:59:01.277]  A lot of states have.
[01:59:01.398 --> 01:59:02.258]  Texas has that too.
[01:59:02.758 --> 01:59:06.499]  Now, this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[01:59:07.079 --> 01:59:09.880]  So, he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[01:59:12.455 --> 01:59:16.421]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[01:59:16.802 --> 01:59:18.885]  We normally sell for $249, it's a great deal.
[01:59:19.486 --> 01:59:22.650]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[01:59:22.991 --> 01:59:23.311]  It's $127!
[01:59:24.032 --> 01:59:27.818]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:29.830]  I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:31.971]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[01:59:32.011 --> 01:59:32.991]  I mean, I'm all for great deals.
[01:59:33.171 --> 01:59:34.212]  This is insane.
[01:59:34.552 --> 01:59:36.313]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[01:59:36.753 --> 01:59:38.714]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family.
[01:59:38.734 --> 01:59:40.115]  Get the best, the best deal.
[01:59:40.515 --> 01:59:42.716]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[01:59:42.836 --> 01:59:43.356]  It's amazing.
[01:59:43.437 --> 01:59:49.460]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:55.089 --> 01:59:59.199]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.741 --> 02:00:01.024]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:25.961]  Yeah.
[02:00:37.498 --> 02:00:43.780]  You know, poor Katie Hopkins is here from the UK and it'd be like I tried to serve her tea and crumpets.
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:45.041]  Yes, yes.
[02:00:45.101 --> 02:00:47.662]  Or New Yorkers come to Texas and they go, where are the horses?
[02:00:47.982 --> 02:00:48.242]  Yes.
[02:00:48.342 --> 02:00:50.543]  Or like Roger Stone comes to Texas wearing a huge cowboy hat.
[02:00:50.763 --> 02:00:52.083]  And I have to put up with this racket.
[02:00:52.103 --> 02:00:53.043]  I have to put up with this racket.
[02:00:53.063 --> 02:00:54.884]  I've asked for Land of Hope and Glory.
[02:00:54.984 --> 02:00:57.705]  I've asked for God Save the Queen, my version.
[02:00:59.065 --> 02:01:01.666]  Or some rugby songs.
[02:01:01.706 --> 02:01:02.267]  Do I get them?
[02:01:02.327 --> 02:01:03.427]  No, I get this nonsense.
[02:01:03.567 --> 02:01:05.089]  That's the sort of team you've got behind you.
[02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.970]  That is not good.
[02:01:06.611 --> 02:01:07.132]  Not good enough.
[02:01:07.592 --> 02:01:09.595]  Listen, you're going to interview me, you're going to be on The War Room.
[02:01:09.695 --> 02:01:12.899]  I could have you on so much and hopefully we'll be working more together.
[02:01:12.959 --> 02:01:14.401]  You're doing great work out on the road.
[02:01:15.373 --> 02:01:17.935]  In the last four minutes we have, what other big nuggets?
[02:01:17.955 --> 02:01:22.958]  I mean, really, you're here raising the alarm from the UK that may actually be lost.
[02:01:23.218 --> 02:01:26.400]  I'm here to raise the alarm for particularly Minnesota and Michigan.
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:29.082]  They know they're screwed, but I'm here to tell you, you really are screwed.
[02:01:29.482 --> 02:01:36.267]  And the last thing I'd like to talk about, please, is Aisha Bibi, a lady, a persecuted Christian in Pakistan.
[02:01:36.647 --> 02:01:38.588]  She was alleged to have committed blasphemy.
[02:01:38.728 --> 02:01:41.210]  She was kept on death row for nine years.
[02:01:41.730 --> 02:01:44.111]  She was released recently by the Supreme Court.
[02:01:44.171 --> 02:01:48.992]  Very brave decision because now everybody wants to kill the judges that says no she didn't commit blasphemy.
[02:01:49.532 --> 02:01:58.935]  She asked the UK, she's a mother of five, she asked the UK if her family could begin a new life in the UK and what do you think we told her Alex?
[02:01:59.355 --> 02:02:03.416]  As a Christian country, what do you think we told a persecuted Christian?
[02:02:03.957 --> 02:02:04.817]  We told her no.
[02:02:05.877 --> 02:02:11.221]  You cannot have asylum in the UK because we do not want to upset local communities.
[02:02:11.902 --> 02:02:14.764]  We don't want to upset local communities.
[02:02:15.184 --> 02:02:24.311]  Can you imagine a situation where a persecuted woman, a Christian, can't... we accept jihadis, we accept half of Africa, we accept
[02:02:24.791 --> 02:02:30.913]  You accept ISIS and Al-Qaeda if they say they want to come back and be reformed and they're given better housing than war vets.
[02:02:30.933 --> 02:02:32.013]  I mean, that's in the news.
[02:02:32.273 --> 02:02:33.753]  So this woman, they're trying to kill her.
[02:02:33.793 --> 02:02:34.714]  There's a fatwa out.
[02:02:34.954 --> 02:02:35.674]  She's a Christian.
[02:02:35.714 --> 02:02:36.734]  She has incredible courage.
[02:02:36.914 --> 02:02:39.395]  She's a political prisoner, a political dissident.
[02:02:39.635 --> 02:02:41.415]  And she says, please help me christened him.
[02:02:41.635 --> 02:02:44.436]  And the left says, not just no, hell no, lady.
[02:02:44.716 --> 02:02:51.261]  And the right and the Prime Minister and everybody in my country says no because we don't want to upset the Muslim communities.
[02:02:51.341 --> 02:03:07.792]  And so I say the next time we have an Islamic terrorist attack in the UK and the next time our political leadership stands up and says we carry on as normal, we are not going to be beaten by terrorists, we are not cowed, remember Asia Bibi.
[02:03:08.232 --> 02:03:09.355]  We are cowed.
[02:03:09.695 --> 02:03:17.430]  This is the symbol of how my country is cowed because we will not give refuge to a Christian woman because we don't want to upset the Muslims.
[02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:18.492]  Who they're trying to kill.
[02:03:20.063 --> 02:03:20.824]  They will kill her.
[02:03:21.124 --> 02:03:21.745]  They will kill her.
[02:03:21.765 --> 02:03:23.186]  And the left, why is the left?
[02:03:23.366 --> 02:03:24.107]  It really is spiritual.
[02:03:24.127 --> 02:03:25.328]  But it's the right as well, Alex.
[02:03:25.408 --> 02:03:26.309]  It's not just the right.
[02:03:26.329 --> 02:03:33.516]  No, no, they all want a virtue signal to the precious Muslims and just run around behind them and like, you know, their droppings are like gold.
[02:03:33.576 --> 02:03:36.479]  And it's just, oh please let me give all my rights up to you.
[02:03:36.499 --> 02:03:37.260]  Oh, you're so wonderful.
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:38.061]  Most of you don't work.
[02:03:38.101 --> 02:03:41.564]  You wear these big nightgown diapers out in public and I have to kiss your ass.
[02:03:42.745 --> 02:03:43.486]  It's so true!
[02:03:43.506 --> 02:03:46.669]  And you know this to me is the ultimate symbol we're cowed.
[02:03:46.689 --> 02:03:57.237]  We just had a European Court of Human Rights ruling that says the right of Muslims not to be offended is greater than the freedom to speak or to speak freely.
[02:03:57.557 --> 02:03:58.758]  And this is what we have now.
[02:03:58.818 --> 02:04:00.339]  Blasphemy laws in the UK.
[02:04:00.379 --> 02:04:01.020]  And I want to be clear.
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:02.721]  They're trying to conquer us.
[02:04:02.841 --> 02:04:08.106]  I was against the wars in the Middle East and we took out moderate regimes and put the bad ones in as part of this plan.
[02:04:08.806 --> 02:04:09.306]  It's insane.
[02:04:09.506 --> 02:04:10.607]  It is properly insane.
[02:04:10.907 --> 02:04:31.539]  And it is properly insane that in the face of not giving a Christian woman, you know, any kind of refuge, having welcomed... Well, it's in the same realm that now they're saying within 10 years all women's sports, including basketball, will be ruled by men who literally have not even had their testicles removed, and are two feet, three feet taller than women, and look like they can come in the barbarian's ash.
[02:04:32.918 --> 02:04:35.980]  We truly have reached a new stage of madness.
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:37.041]  We really have.
[02:04:37.161 --> 02:04:39.462]  And the UK is truly fallen.
[02:04:39.602 --> 02:04:40.483]  We are beyond sad.
[02:04:40.503 --> 02:04:45.406]  Well, you know already in the Olympics, two or three of the top runners that win all the championships are actually hermaphrodites.
[02:04:45.707 --> 02:04:46.087]  Oh, of course.
[02:04:46.107 --> 02:04:49.329]  And of course, nothing against hermaphrodites, but you know, these guys can have babies.
[02:04:49.969 --> 02:04:51.190]  I mean, they can get women pregnant.
[02:04:51.931 --> 02:04:52.591]  Oh my gosh.
[02:04:53.212 --> 02:04:54.452]  Katie Hopkins, amazing.
[02:04:54.633 --> 02:04:56.114]  Hopkins World, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:56.134 --> 02:04:57.134]  Check it out today.
[02:04:57.554 --> 02:04:59.075]  Hopkinsworld.com.
[02:04:59.336 --> 02:05:00.516]  Mark Dyche, coming up.
[02:05:00.556 --> 02:05:01.017]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.707 --> 02:05:09.090]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:10.911]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[02:05:10.951 --> 02:05:11.552]  It's a good thing.
[02:05:11.592 --> 02:05:14.794]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:05:15.194 --> 02:05:17.515]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[02:05:17.555 --> 02:05:18.656]  I learned what the best was.
[02:05:19.056 --> 02:05:24.038]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[02:05:24.198 --> 02:05:24.718]  It's amazing.
[02:05:24.918 --> 02:05:27.319]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[02:05:27.499 --> 02:05:34.162]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:05:34.342 --> 02:05:35.963]  He has a glut of them.
[02:05:36.003 --> 02:05:38.343]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:05:39.844 --> 02:05:42.986]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[02:05:43.346 --> 02:05:43.646]  It's $127!
[02:05:44.367 --> 02:05:48.149]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[02:05:48.529 --> 02:05:50.311]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:05:50.651 --> 02:05:52.892]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[02:05:52.992 --> 02:05:53.513]  It's amazing.
[02:05:53.593 --> 02:05:59.616]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:14.443 --> 02:06:19.567]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:06:20.068 --> 02:06:22.429]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.451 --> 02:06:34.179]  You know, people like Katie Hopkins, people like Ron Paul, people like Paul Joseph Watson, people like Mark Deich, people like Matt Drudge, people like Tucker Carlson.
[02:06:35.234 --> 02:06:36.655]  I've talked to quite a bit of them, leave it at that.
[02:06:37.275 --> 02:06:46.160]  It's just so good to be a patriot, to be a nationalist, to be a Christian, and to be for freedom, and to get to know all the coolest people in the world, like President Trump.
[02:06:46.761 --> 02:06:50.242]  You look at our people, whether they're black, white, old, young.
[02:06:51.423 --> 02:06:53.125]  They have light in their eyes of liberty.
[02:06:53.185 --> 02:06:55.447]  You look at the left, they are crazy people.
[02:06:55.967 --> 02:06:57.388]  Mark Dice with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:06:57.428 --> 02:06:59.930]  He's got his new book that starts ordering today.
[02:07:00.011 --> 02:07:04.815]  We've got a big shipment of them coming in, so we'll have those links up on InfoWareStore.com.
[02:07:05.135 --> 02:07:08.037]  We'll tell you about his new book here in just a moment.
[02:07:08.057 --> 02:07:12.261]  But first, let's play one of his best little pieces here that went viral with tens of millions of views.
[02:07:12.641 --> 02:07:15.203]  Cable News Crazies, completely unchanged.
[02:07:15.604 --> 02:07:16.545]  Mark Dice, here it is.
[02:07:17.506 --> 02:07:23.928]  We're gonna see if this reign lasts for 30 days, or two years, or a thousand year reich!
[02:07:24.288 --> 02:07:28.249]  Because that is how, that is what these people have set themselves up for.
[02:07:28.389 --> 02:07:35.731]  And I believe that they need to move from saying, well, I don't like his tweets, but, you know, the economy's doing okay.
[02:07:35.791 --> 02:07:42.493]  I mean, they need to move from there to reality, which is that we have a white nationalist president who's a threat to American democracy,
[02:07:42.933 --> 02:07:51.702]  Not only is Donald Trump a white supremacist sympathizer, I think he identifies with this notion of white supremacy, this notion of preservation of white culture.
[02:07:52.122 --> 02:07:54.925]  This is about black versus white.
[02:07:54.985 --> 02:08:04.695]  This is about Donald Trump's appeal to racism, and it just happens all the time, and we never say it, or we don't say it enough for what it is, but that's what's going on.
[02:08:04.875 --> 02:08:07.536]  He went full Hitler and admitted he's a nationalist.
[02:08:07.556 --> 02:08:10.017]  We can stop calling it a dog whistle.
[02:08:10.037 --> 02:08:13.118]  Look at what his slogan, Make America Great Again, means.
[02:08:13.699 --> 02:08:14.439]  We know what it means.
[02:08:14.679 --> 02:08:15.319]  We know what it meant.
[02:08:15.799 --> 02:08:17.560]  Make America White Again.
[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:23.883]  You have a Republican Party who is giving aid and comfort to the Proud Boys and to white nationalists.
[02:08:23.923 --> 02:08:26.964]  And they've become the party of white nationalists and all of their hatred.
[02:08:27.524 --> 02:08:28.865]  A guy who was sending a message.
[02:08:29.545 --> 02:08:41.925]  By time and time again tweeting about baseball or talking about his bad hair day there, that was done intentionally to send a message to white nationalists.
[02:08:43.135 --> 02:08:45.216]  I didn't think white people would put him in office.
[02:08:46.057 --> 02:08:52.060]  So here he is, running around the country, appealing to our darker angels, appealing to our hatreds and fears.
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:09:00.025]  Do they agree with him, or is he using some sort of, like, cult-like force to try to make them see that?
[02:09:00.405 --> 02:09:01.525]  We're gonna right this ship.
[02:09:01.886 --> 02:09:03.126]  We are gonna right this ship.
[02:09:03.166 --> 02:09:04.867]  There's no way that he's gonna prevail.
[02:09:05.167 --> 02:09:05.968]  Because he's evil.
[02:09:06.208 --> 02:09:06.748]  He's dark.
[02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:09.330]  It's the opposite of what America stands for.
[02:09:09.969 --> 02:09:13.052]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:09:14.513 --> 02:09:15.615]  A lot of us already knew that.
[02:09:16.395 --> 02:09:20.219]  Kanye West is engaging in one of the most nefarious practices yet.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:33.372]  A black body and brain are the warehouse for the articulation and expression of anti-black sentiments that have been chin-checked by people with far more rigorous credentials.
[02:09:33.972 --> 02:09:35.913]  This is white supremacy by ventriloquism.
[02:09:36.293 --> 02:09:41.355]  A black mouth is moving, but white racist ideals are flowing from Kanye West's mouth.
[02:09:41.755 --> 02:09:43.756]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[02:09:45.037 --> 02:09:48.458]  And we have this now, and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it.
[02:09:48.618 --> 02:09:51.940]  The thing about Trump, though, is that he's the recruiter-in-chief.
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:56.662]  He is basically working with ISIS to kill us.
[02:09:57.162 --> 02:10:01.085]  This president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did.
[02:10:01.385 --> 02:10:07.230]  I mean, the way he talks, the way he, the way he... That is, that's just, it's impossible to say that.
[02:10:07.250 --> 02:10:16.576]  The way he talks, the way that he allows these people, the way he winks and nods to these groups, the way he says, I know I'm not supposed to say it, but I'm a nationalist.
[02:10:16.857 --> 02:10:21.100]  He wants to send the military to the border, so... I would have sent the military to the White House to get him.
[02:10:25.071 --> 02:10:28.152]  I don't even know if we're going to get to 2020 as a democracy.
[02:10:29.112 --> 02:10:39.977]  So we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right.
[02:10:40.797 --> 02:10:42.638]  And we have to start doing something about them.
[02:10:42.678 --> 02:10:45.099]  There is no travel ban on them.
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:48.201]  There is no ban on, you know, the Muslim ban.
[02:10:48.241 --> 02:10:49.661]  There is no white guy ban.
[02:10:50.081 --> 02:10:51.142]  So what do we do about that?
[02:10:51.653 --> 02:10:53.155]  I don't want to have that fight with you.
[02:10:53.235 --> 02:10:54.116]  Hey, it's okay.
[02:10:54.276 --> 02:10:55.157]  Leslie, it's okay.
[02:10:55.237 --> 02:10:57.620]  In the meantime, I'm president and you're not.
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:00.062]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:11:00.583 --> 02:11:05.689]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:11:08.166 --> 02:11:13.310]  Well, Mark Dice has been a busy media commentator for the decade plus I've known him.
[02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:14.691]  Wow, how time flies.
[02:11:15.011 --> 02:11:16.032]  MarkDice.com.
[02:11:17.313 --> 02:11:20.515]  And for now he's been shadow banned and demonetized.
[02:11:20.715 --> 02:11:26.179]  But he still reaches tens of millions of people a week on YouTube and at Twitter at Mark Dice.
[02:11:26.239 --> 02:11:27.900]  And I see him stick up for me all the time.
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:30.682]  I don't have a voice on those platforms.
[02:11:32.164 --> 02:11:33.424]  The bad part about the censorship is this.
[02:11:34.325 --> 02:11:35.086]  They can then
[02:11:37.807 --> 02:11:41.669]  Say whatever they want about you, whatever lies they want about you, and you can't respond.
[02:11:41.689 --> 02:11:43.590]  They can say that we put up fake video when we don't.
[02:11:43.630 --> 02:11:44.711]  They can say that I'm a Nazi.
[02:11:45.071 --> 02:11:45.431]  We're not.
[02:11:45.832 --> 02:11:47.793]  It's good to have people sticking up for us like Mark Dice.
[02:11:48.253 --> 02:11:53.256]  You know, Mark started making videos every day about Infowars when we got banned, and like every week since then.
[02:11:53.556 --> 02:12:01.801]  But almost everybody else, including old so-called friends, won't even talk to me now because they're so afraid it's gonna happen to them.
[02:12:02.221 --> 02:12:04.803]  That's the spirit that'll allow the takeover to happen.
[02:12:06.178 --> 02:12:08.019]  And so we hang together, we hang separate.
[02:12:08.059 --> 02:12:11.561]  Mark, you've got a new book out that just came out today.
[02:12:12.021 --> 02:12:15.563]  I've got a big shipment of them coming in here to m4store.com.
[02:12:16.323 --> 02:12:17.864]  Liberalism, Find a Cure.
[02:12:18.404 --> 02:12:20.706]  Great name, always great information.
[02:12:21.046 --> 02:12:22.747]  We really do need a cure.
[02:12:23.087 --> 02:12:24.828]  So Mark, what do you want to dive into first?
[02:12:26.587 --> 02:12:32.532]  Well, first of all, it's an honor to be on the most banned broadcast probably in world history, and that's not an exaggeration.
[02:12:32.832 --> 02:12:45.922]  And modern liberalism has ballooned into a mental health crisis, and that clip that you just played, that compilation, is just a small sample of what the general public are inundated with every day on MSNBC and CNN.
[02:12:45.962 --> 02:12:51.446]  And I joke that I watch CNN so that you don't have to, because that's what people are subjected to every day.
[02:12:51.666 --> 02:12:53.628]  And if we win this, which hopefully we will,
[02:12:54.148 --> 02:13:09.619]  It's clips like that which will literally be in the history books analyzing the level of propaganda that was being pushed because it's even more vile and more sophisticated than the propaganda that helped foment communist revolutions in China and in Russia.
[02:13:10.239 --> 02:13:12.741]  And we're seeing the Democrat Party
[02:13:13.607 --> 02:13:24.451]  has morphed into this strange Maoist, communist, little red shirt, Stalinist type of a group.
[02:13:24.511 --> 02:13:30.393]  Because for generations, the differences between liberals and conservatives were pretty well established.
[02:13:31.214 --> 02:13:34.375]  You knew generally where each party stood on certain issues.
[02:13:34.855 --> 02:13:39.817]  Each party had reasonable arguments about the issues that they were putting forth.
[02:13:40.464 --> 02:13:49.836]  But in the last few years, the Democrat Party, Democrats, liberals, the left, have morphed into this social justice warrior psychosis.
[02:13:50.056 --> 02:13:52.820]  And it is a mental health crisis.
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:59.368]  And most of your audience has probably been monitoring this for some time, but even if you've been watching this unfold for the last few years,
[02:14:00.294 --> 02:14:04.295]  It's just the tip of the insanity iceberg that's getting ready to burst through.
[02:14:04.335 --> 02:14:16.459]  And if we don't stop this cultural revolution, this cultural Marxist revolution that they're trying to push forward, the human race is going to be fragmented into so many different pieces.
[02:14:16.559 --> 02:14:18.540]  Oh, we're going to have a nuclear war.
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:19.520]  We're going to kill each other.
[02:14:19.540 --> 02:14:25.182]  The fact that the psych warfare experts are undermining civilization to try to maintain control
[02:14:26.321 --> 02:14:27.121]  Which is in the WikiLeaks.
[02:14:27.141 --> 02:14:27.922]  They admit they're doing it.
[02:14:27.942 --> 02:14:35.725]  And the fact that they're going to pure Hitler-level race-baiting, but just from the minority perspective, trying to invoke total division, it's criminal!
[02:14:36.105 --> 02:14:38.106]  It's a wonder we're not in total civil war!
[02:14:38.386 --> 02:14:43.888]  It's horrible in Wisconsin, all these young kids hiling Hitler with a black kid with them, but they're doing it
[02:14:44.548 --> 02:14:47.249]  As a response to the total Hitlerian garbage from the left.
[02:14:47.289 --> 02:14:48.449]  And I decry both sides.
[02:14:48.749 --> 02:14:49.689]  But that's what you're going to do.
[02:14:49.729 --> 02:14:51.389]  You're going to make people into extreme groups.
[02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:53.210]  Just like they do in prisons on purpose.
[02:14:53.490 --> 02:14:54.990]  Where they put everybody in their own racial group.
[02:14:55.050 --> 02:14:56.550]  And you've got to get a Nazi tattoo.
[02:14:57.291 --> 02:14:58.671]  Or the whites kill you if you're white.
[02:14:58.891 --> 02:15:01.191]  You've got to join the racist black group and get the tattoo.
[02:15:01.451 --> 02:15:02.192]  Or they're going to kill you.
[02:15:02.212 --> 02:15:04.972]  You've got to join the Mexican Mafia or MS-13.
[02:15:05.552 --> 02:15:06.492]  Or they're going to kill you.
[02:15:06.572 --> 02:15:09.453]  They are making people get into these racial groups.
[02:15:10.888 --> 02:15:11.328]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:15:11.348 --> 02:15:25.576]  And a lot of that photo you're talking about, the students making the hand sign, is really just them trolling and reacting to this oppression of free speech, trying to get a reaction, trying to push the envelope as far as they can.
[02:15:26.096 --> 02:15:29.958]  And these leftists are pushing our culture so far over the cliff.
[02:15:30.378 --> 02:15:32.880]  The Victoria's Secret fashion show was just last week.
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:42.463]  And now there's a campaign in order to include transgender women in the Victoria's Secret's catalog and in the fashion show.
[02:15:42.963 --> 02:15:44.703]  Obese women, fat women.
[02:15:44.723 --> 02:15:46.844]  I'm sorry, you're not even allowed to say fat anymore.
[02:15:46.884 --> 02:15:47.624]  That's divisive.
[02:15:47.744 --> 02:15:52.025]  Every culture, every society, every system that has its own culture is under attack.
[02:15:52.285 --> 02:15:58.807]  This is the megacorporations taking over all culture to then dictate that only they can tell you what's proper culture.
[02:15:59.167 --> 02:15:59.967]  This is the board.
[02:16:00.047 --> 02:16:00.948]  You will be assimilated.
[02:16:01.248 --> 02:16:01.708]  I say no.
[02:16:02.705 --> 02:16:13.139]  As many of you know, we have just offered in the last few months the biggest sales in InfoWars history because the globalists have been trying to literally take our credit card processing away.
[02:16:13.159 --> 02:16:15.382]  They've been trying to hack our sites and bring them down.
[02:16:15.783 --> 02:16:17.705]  They have not been successful.
[02:16:18.326 --> 02:16:23.869]  Now, a lot of times, other companies claim they have the best deals of the year on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.
[02:16:24.309 --> 02:16:26.211]  And it's been in the news that a lot of those are scams.
[02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:34.355]  You know, have things in a limited amount to lure you in and have the retail jacked up above what it's supposed to be and then lower it down.
[02:16:34.595 --> 02:16:35.676]  There's a lot of scams going on.
[02:16:36.276 --> 02:16:39.198]  Zero of that is going on at Infoworkstore.com.
[02:16:39.758 --> 02:16:40.859]  And you're getting great deals.
[02:16:41.539 --> 02:16:44.041]  And we've got everything in stock right now, almost everything.
[02:16:44.881 --> 02:16:47.122]  And obviously you're funding the information war against the globalists.
[02:16:47.422 --> 02:16:48.563]  So it's a 360 win.
[02:16:48.923 --> 02:16:51.004]  Don't fight the traffic for Christmas shopping.
[02:16:51.684 --> 02:16:58.707]  Know you're supporting an organization and group that is absolutely driving the globalists crazy and raising the alarm worldwide.
[02:16:59.127 --> 02:17:02.469]  It is a 360 win on this Black Friday.
[02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:04.009]  But the sale isn't just this Black Friday.
[02:17:04.570 --> 02:17:11.753]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[02:17:12.213 --> 02:17:14.778]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, free shipping storewide.
[02:17:15.299 --> 02:17:16.001]  Let me read this to you.
[02:17:17.103 --> 02:17:20.950]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:17:22.375 --> 02:17:26.636]  In fact, this is even... Okay, this is the best sale ever.
[02:17:26.876 --> 02:17:31.977]  Because we're doing the sale from a while back that was the best ever with a free Chevy 50% off storewide.
[02:17:32.477 --> 02:17:35.577]  And double Patriot points, which normal Patriot point is 5%.
[02:17:36.237 --> 02:17:38.558]  And so now this is 10%.
[02:17:38.958 --> 02:17:40.938]  So this makes a bunch of these complete lost leaders.
[02:17:40.978 --> 02:17:41.638]  This is insane.
[02:17:42.239 --> 02:17:43.279]  Okay, so let me be clear here.
[02:17:44.199 --> 02:17:45.839]  And just put this out like this.
[02:17:45.919 --> 02:17:46.599]  It's so much to say.
[02:17:46.639 --> 02:17:47.299]  We'll just put it out.
[02:17:47.619 --> 02:17:48.560]  No teleprompters here.
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:49.640]  Black Friday.
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:55.624]  InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:17:56.645 --> 02:18:02.789]  All InfoWars life supplements, 50% off with the free shipping and the double Patriot points.
[02:18:03.590 --> 02:18:08.374]  Up to 50% off on storable food, super high quality, that is huge.
[02:18:08.994 --> 02:18:11.497]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[02:18:11.897 --> 02:18:13.299]  Oh, this is the one that is the best ever.
[02:18:13.319 --> 02:18:14.540]  I can say on Black Friday.
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:15.741]  We've been running this sale a few weeks.
[02:18:15.782 --> 02:18:19.245]  This is the best we've ever done.
[02:18:19.265 --> 02:18:22.909]  $127 or 49% off Alexa Pure Pro Gravity Fed Filters.
[02:18:23.610 --> 02:18:24.971]  One of the best systems out there.
[02:18:25.312 --> 02:18:25.993]  Leading competitors $300, $400.
[02:18:26.053 --> 02:18:26.673]  They usually retail at $240.
[02:18:30.317 --> 02:18:31.338]  Six, that's a great deal.
[02:18:31.778 --> 02:18:41.062]  We now have it at $127 because they ordered too many and want to again sell them out before the new year so they don't have to pay inventory tax to the feds and the state.
[02:18:42.002 --> 02:18:45.564]  Alexa Pure Breeze, air filtration, now at 40% off.
[02:18:45.624 --> 02:18:47.965]  That's right at Lost Leader, again to get rid of inventory.
[02:18:48.165 --> 02:18:49.105]  So take advantage of that.
[02:18:49.125 --> 02:18:49.966]  It's an amazing system.
[02:18:50.726 --> 02:18:56.989]  Also, there's a bunch of special sections where we've got other deals at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:58.509]  Too many to name.
[02:18:58.850 --> 02:19:04.912]  Up to 75% off, storewide, plus free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:19:05.893 --> 02:19:11.595]  Up to 75% off, storewide, plus free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:19:11.655 --> 02:19:16.657]  So, actually, now that I'm here, looking at this and thinking, this is the best deal we've ever done.
[02:19:17.357 --> 02:19:18.698]  So it actually tops the last deal.
[02:19:19.338 --> 02:19:30.646]  And you know what, just put this out like it is, because it just shows how we're being transparent here, and this is so insane that they're trying to shut down our credit card processors, they're trying to shut down InfoWars, they're trying to defund us.
[02:19:30.907 --> 02:19:33.709]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[02:19:33.889 --> 02:19:40.434]  All of our inventory, I intend to have gone, so that we're at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[02:19:40.934 --> 02:19:45.796]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:46.036 --> 02:19:51.838]  Support the InfoWars, get great products, get your Christmas shopping done early, and battle the globalists.
[02:19:52.059 --> 02:19:54.299]  A total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:55.560]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:20:05.208 --> 02:20:09.318]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:11.143]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:20:33.601 --> 02:20:38.545]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:40.326 --> 02:20:44.750]  Well, back on August 6th when I got banned on 30-something big platforms, now it's hundreds.
[02:20:45.956 --> 02:20:48.859]  Mark Deist and others pointed out that everybody else is next.
[02:20:49.559 --> 02:20:52.242]  And now they're going after leftist groups as well.
[02:20:52.762 --> 02:20:54.504]  Establishment left goes after rival left.
[02:20:54.624 --> 02:20:56.365]  Once the dam breaks, everybody gets censored.
[02:20:56.926 --> 02:20:57.707]  Congress needs to act.
[02:20:57.747 --> 02:20:58.687]  The President needs to act.
[02:20:58.707 --> 02:21:03.452]  We need to get all the influential people like Mark Deist and others just to push the President to act.
[02:21:03.492 --> 02:21:04.673]  And the President's getting ready to act.
[02:21:05.253 --> 02:21:06.895]  I know Tucker Carlson's pushing him as well.
[02:21:06.915 --> 02:21:07.736]  But you talked, Mark.
[02:21:08.056 --> 02:21:10.038]  Mark Deist, media commentator at markdeist.com.
[02:21:11.564 --> 02:21:22.968]  You know, beloved out there for years, the great work you do, pointing out the irony, the corruption, the craziness of the out-of-control left and their race-based politics and system.
[02:21:25.569 --> 02:21:26.630]  Where are they going to go next?
[02:21:27.450 --> 02:21:34.093]  Because you're sort of bringing this up, that this weaponization is so dangerous that it's not like it's just some ideology.
[02:21:34.153 --> 02:21:38.774]  This is an ideology that wants to take over every facet of society.
[02:21:38.814 --> 02:21:40.255]  It wants total domination.
[02:21:42.034 --> 02:21:52.959]  Well, they're developing more sophisticated AI systems every day, so if you just use the wrong words, or post the wrong photo, or post a link to certain websites, then that'll just be disappeared down the memory hole.
[02:21:52.979 --> 02:22:01.523]  The Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is talking about removing the public follower count and the like count, because
[02:22:02.243 --> 02:22:13.514]  If somebody like me can have 350,000 Twitter followers and over a million YouTube subscribers, that shows that my message is resonating with a lot of people, and so they don't want people to see that.
[02:22:13.795 --> 02:22:17.098]  And I just checked, even before coming on this broadcast, Alex,
[02:22:17.819 --> 02:22:22.642]  My book, Liberals and Find a Cure, number 18 on Amazon's bestseller list.
[02:22:22.862 --> 02:22:24.904]  That's before doing any interviews.
[02:22:24.944 --> 02:22:33.669]  That's literally just announcing it on my YouTube channel, which gets about a third of the audience as Anderson Cooper or Don Lemon, which is why they're scared to death.
[02:22:33.729 --> 02:22:41.154]  Because if just one guy on a laptop in his kitchen can get a third of the viewers of CNN, a billion-dollar network,
[02:22:41.694 --> 02:22:45.558]  And Rise break through the top 20 on Amazon's bestseller list.
[02:22:45.858 --> 02:22:48.880]  Who knows how high we can get it, so I hope everyone will pick up a copy.
[02:22:49.041 --> 02:22:52.924]  Well, that is super exciting, and it's like when our apps went to number one.
[02:22:54.125 --> 02:23:02.912]  Apple just took the app down five stars, 30-something thousand reviews, three million downloads, and their answer was, we're just taking it down part of the curation.
[02:23:03.293 --> 02:23:06.716]  And Tim Cook, oh, if something has five stars and people love it,
[02:23:07.236 --> 02:23:08.177]  And it's backfired on us.
[02:23:08.297 --> 02:23:09.559]  We'll just remove it.
[02:23:09.579 --> 02:23:10.540]  But what you said is huge.
[02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:11.782]  That's not just in political then.
[02:23:11.822 --> 02:23:13.484]  That's number 18 total.
[02:23:14.405 --> 02:23:16.188]  That shows how hungry... And I've got to correct you.
[02:23:17.301 --> 02:23:18.742]  You get put on all these other platforms.
[02:23:18.782 --> 02:23:19.683]  You get aired everywhere.
[02:23:19.723 --> 02:23:21.124]  They manipulate your view counts.
[02:23:21.304 --> 02:23:23.466]  You have well over a million views on all your videos.
[02:23:23.486 --> 02:23:25.288]  You have some videos with 10, 15, 20 million views.
[02:23:26.208 --> 02:23:30.512]  When you hear that Anderson Cooper has a million, two million viewers, Nielsen's been caught faking those.
[02:23:30.532 --> 02:23:32.353]  They have to pay to be on at airports.
[02:23:32.393 --> 02:23:35.055]  They have to pay to be on all these places, and they add that into it.
[02:23:36.256 --> 02:23:42.742]  When Cooper got paid, what was it, tens of millions of dollars by Facebook to do these videos, literally
[02:23:44.783 --> 02:23:48.026]  My junior reporters would have five times the viewers of Anderson Cooper.
[02:23:48.346 --> 02:23:51.629]  That's why they had to take us off Twitter and take us off Facebook for our live feeds.
[02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:57.214]  So I can go out in my backyard and shoot a video and they would have, you know, 300,000 even after they put the shadow ban on us.
[02:23:57.514 --> 02:24:02.979]  And then Cooper is being paid millions and the thing's got 50,000 views after he's on there for an hour with total promotion.
[02:24:03.019 --> 02:24:05.221]  So you're bigger than Anderson Cooper.
[02:24:05.261 --> 02:24:06.182]  Let's be clear, Mark Dice.
[02:24:07.569 --> 02:24:13.955]  And I think so, and thanks for pointing that out, because we do have to really look at the solid numbers.
[02:24:14.055 --> 02:24:19.139]  Anderson Cooper's live streams on Facebook, like you were talking about, he was getting barely 2,000 viewers.
[02:24:20.020 --> 02:24:21.121]  A total joke.
[02:24:21.421 --> 02:24:27.587]  That's why earlier this year, as you know, YouTube manipulated the algorithm so that whenever you search for almost any topic,
[02:24:28.027 --> 02:24:41.401]  The top search results are all authoritative sources from mainstream media, and before that it used to be the most popular videos, the most well-engaged, videos with the most watch time, and so that was a way for... So they've broken their algorithm?
[02:24:42.965 --> 02:24:52.194]  They've favored all of the mainstream media news outlets, and I did a test on some of my most popular videos, one of which was buried under 50 other results.
[02:24:52.734 --> 02:24:57.538]  Results that had a few thousand views, and all from mainstream media channels.
[02:24:58.019 --> 02:25:02.022]  They're terrified of our message, which is why they banned you from almost everything.
[02:25:02.403 --> 02:25:07.507]  It's quite stunning, and they memory hold Alex Jones, which is despicable, and it was
[02:25:08.408 --> 02:25:35.636]  It was good to see some people come out and support, but it was also disappointing that there wasn't more support for Alex, because I think a lot of people were a little bit scared, or perhaps they want to distance themselves from some of the things that Alex has said in the past, but what they did to Alex was a test, and now that they were able to do it, they just keep on going, keep on going, and you notice the group that went and harassed Tucker Carlson's wife and kids outside of his own house,
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.942]  They were still allowed, last I checked, they were still on Facebook.
[02:25:39.263 --> 02:25:48.130]  They were allowed on Twitter for 12 to 16 hours after they posted that video, and they were posting other videos harassing other politicians, Ted Cruz and others.
[02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:55.096]  Posting their children's schools, posting their phone numbers, doxing people, and you said something key earlier.
[02:25:55.116 --> 02:26:03.283]  They, years ago, began to take comment sections out of the big papers because they learned people respected that more than the article, and most of it was a lake.
[02:26:04.468 --> 02:26:23.225]  Just like they can't have you with five stars, so Netflix and others start taking away the star process, because they're going to steal elections now out in the open, and they can't have us be super popular and get all the popular votes online with any form of voting system, and then the Liberty Movement loses at the polls.
[02:26:23.486 --> 02:26:26.108]  So they can't let anybody know that you're not alone.
[02:26:26.368 --> 02:26:28.010]  In fact, they talk about it in white papers.
[02:26:28.490 --> 02:26:29.791]  Don't let us have any community.
[02:26:29.871 --> 02:26:31.333]  Don't let us have any aid or comfort.
[02:26:31.573 --> 02:26:32.794]  Don't let us have any culture.
[02:26:33.195 --> 02:26:35.657]  Make us be totally alone in our Facebook prison.
[02:26:35.937 --> 02:26:50.932]  Facebook executives have gone public, saying we're there to make you depressed, under our control, and then we have fake political bots that become your friends that aren't even real people, ten to one, and then you're literally in a mental institution under their radicalization, under their mind control.
[02:26:53.050 --> 02:26:58.474]  And they're setting this up so that ordinary Americans can't disagree with this insane agenda.
[02:26:58.894 --> 02:27:22.311]  Part of the reason that you were banned is because you criticized a drag queen festival that involved children and things that I don't even want to discuss, but I do cover in the book, by the way, and I quoted exactly what you said about it, and it seems reasonable criticism to me, a reasonable reaction, but that's not allowed because 2 plus 2 equals 5 under the current establishment, and so people are getting scared
[02:27:22.791 --> 02:27:26.694]  To even speak out against this insane agenda.
[02:27:27.154 --> 02:27:29.055]  And so they keep pushing it further and further.
[02:27:29.456 --> 02:27:34.139]  And people, big companies as well, are afraid to not cave into this.
[02:27:35.079 --> 02:27:38.862]  I saw that you covered my tweet to Target about the Black Panther.
[02:27:38.902 --> 02:27:40.443]  Oh, I should have opened it up about that.
[02:27:40.483 --> 02:27:42.364]  That was just a few weeks ago during Halloween.
[02:27:42.384 --> 02:27:43.745]  Tell people about that who might have missed it.
[02:27:44.795 --> 02:27:57.158]  It was brought to my attention that a Black Panther Halloween costume model on Target.com was being modeled by a white boy and so I sarcastically tweeted to them that it's terrible and that this is a black only costume and they took it down.
[02:27:57.198 --> 02:28:04.560]  They took down the photo of the white boy modeling the costume and then later I started researching and I saw an article from People Magazine saying, you know what, white parents
[02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:12.128]  You really want to think twice before allowing your children to dress up as the Black Panther Marvel superhero.
[02:28:12.428 --> 02:28:13.430]  And it's so insane.
[02:28:13.450 --> 02:28:20.778]  There's a whole chapter in my book on imaginary racism because with many mental illnesses people hallucinate and see and hear things that aren't there.
[02:28:21.238 --> 02:28:23.341]  And so we've been seeing this rash of
[02:28:24.331 --> 02:28:28.534]  Imaginary racism in companies and communities caving into it.
[02:28:28.874 --> 02:28:39.201]  There was a park, I think it was in Texas, where somebody complained that there was a gorilla in the park because it was an animal-themed, a circus-themed playground for the children.
[02:28:39.581 --> 02:28:43.804]  And of course there was a gorilla there, and a camel, and a lion, and all sorts of other animals.
[02:28:44.424 --> 02:28:49.726]  And somebody complained that, oh, this ape is racist, or this monkey's racist.
[02:28:49.886 --> 02:28:52.507]  And so the city took it down.
[02:28:52.987 --> 02:28:54.267]  They removed the statue.
[02:28:54.327 --> 02:29:00.409]  Hey, all over the country, people who have the last Irish name, Lynch, are changing their name, and they're taking it off buildings.
[02:29:04.431 --> 02:29:07.172]  Let me tell you, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:29:07.232 --> 02:29:08.472]  We've got the global detention.
[02:29:08.552 --> 02:29:09.412]  We're over the target.
[02:29:09.433 --> 02:29:10.213]  We know what we're doing.
[02:29:11.681 --> 02:29:24.710]  How do you even sit here when a private world government that's anti-humans being set up and that's so evil and then the public is so decadent and so dumbed down they believe mainstream media, at least a large part of them, and don't even care about their own future?
[02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:39.900]  There are major corporate consortiums that have spent billions of dollars conditioning the public since the mid-1990s that in the future everyone will take implantable microchips in their hand or in their scalp of their head.
[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:40.360]  But now,
[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:42.961]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of articles.
[02:29:43.141 --> 02:29:44.981]  Soon everyone will have chips.
[02:29:45.121 --> 02:29:46.522]  And there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:29:46.622 --> 02:29:49.523]  And suddenly, they went from you will submit to it's here.
[02:29:49.683 --> 02:29:53.604]  Plan unveiled to microchip hundreds of thousands of employees at major companies.
[02:29:53.864 --> 02:29:56.865]  Alarm over talks to implant UK employees with microchips.
[02:29:56.985 --> 02:29:57.685]  Getting you ready.
[02:29:57.765 --> 02:29:58.805]  You will be chipped.
[02:29:59.046 --> 02:29:59.586]  Eventually.
[02:29:59.826 --> 02:30:00.366]  USA Today.
[02:30:00.586 --> 02:30:03.148]  Major UK companies preparing to microchip employees.
[02:30:03.269 --> 02:30:03.829]  The Telegraph.
[02:30:03.889 --> 02:30:06.972]  Plan unveiled to microchip hundreds of thousands of UK employees at major companies.
[02:30:07.152 --> 02:30:10.675]  One company wants to implant microchips into the hands of hundreds of thousands of global workers.
[02:30:10.875 --> 02:30:18.162]  Thousands of people in Sweden are willingly microchipping their hands and it's part of the transhumanist movement that is sweeping the globe and the Swedish government is financing it.
[02:30:18.302 --> 02:30:19.223]  Are you ready for your chip?
[02:30:19.303 --> 02:30:26.009]  And so who's running the PR in Fox News and CNN and ABC News that soon everyone will have a microchip?
[02:30:26.209 --> 02:30:28.452]  Soon, you won't be able to buy or sell without them!
[02:30:28.532 --> 02:30:30.374]  You don't buy or sell, you die!
[02:30:30.674 --> 02:30:31.615]  Oh, it's so liberal!
[02:30:31.755 --> 02:30:32.837]  What does Time Magazine?
[02:30:32.937 --> 02:30:33.778]  What does Newsweek say?
[02:30:33.798 --> 02:30:40.205]  They've got their new digital issue out, and it says you will take the chip whether you like it or not.
[02:30:40.445 --> 02:30:41.527]  Like it or not!
[02:30:41.627 --> 02:30:43.549]  And how are they gonna get you to take the microchips?
[02:30:43.689 --> 02:30:44.830]  Oh, now you got a thumbprint.
[02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:46.151]  Now there's no more codes allowed.
[02:30:46.251 --> 02:30:49.034]  Now you gotta, with the thumbprint, you gotta have a face scan.
[02:30:49.174 --> 02:30:50.095]  Nope, that doesn't work.
[02:30:50.155 --> 02:30:51.076]  Now you gotta have a chip.
[02:30:51.176 --> 02:30:52.277]  And now everybody's on it.
[02:30:52.337 --> 02:30:53.538]  You're part of the Internet of Things.
[02:30:53.558 --> 02:31:05.329]  You're tied into the beast system with your digital mark, the globalist trademark, with your own bio-frequency identifier that is turned into a code that is implanted and engraved in the chip.
[02:31:05.450 --> 02:31:06.711]  Prophecy fulfilled.
[02:31:07.031 --> 02:31:08.012]  Riddle me that, Batman.
[02:31:08.192 --> 02:31:11.816]  And people don't go, oh my God, it's the Mark of the Beast, or even don't believe in God.
[02:31:11.957 --> 02:31:15.801]  People don't go, man, that'll really be used to abuse people with a global social score.
[02:31:15.961 --> 02:31:28.356]  No, they just go, okay, I'll do it, and then, okay, okay, okay, okay, until, and we're gonna sterilize you now, okay, we're gonna wipe your memories now, okay, yep, totally submit to us, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, now we're gonna get rid of your body, but your
[02:31:28.656 --> 02:31:29.917]  Soul will be stored in this computer.
[02:31:30.117 --> 02:31:30.977]  You go to this center.
[02:31:30.997 --> 02:31:31.897]  It's a quick process.
[02:31:31.937 --> 02:31:33.218]  Your family will still be able to talk to you.
[02:31:33.238 --> 02:31:35.439]  You're gonna live forever once you're uploaded into this computer.
[02:31:35.479 --> 02:31:36.759]  But really, it'll be a facsimile.
[02:31:36.859 --> 02:31:37.840]  And you'll be dead.
[02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:39.400]  They gonna kill your ass.
[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:45.182]  Now, this year, the transhumanists are everywhere saying, to live forever, you're gonna die by global government law.
[02:31:45.322 --> 02:31:46.763]  And you will be uploaded into the machine.
[02:31:46.903 --> 02:31:51.505]  And your family will be able to talk to you, there'll be a hologram of you, and your hologram will be able to get into an avatar.
[02:31:51.705 --> 02:31:53.025]  It's not gonna be daddy.
[02:31:53.185 --> 02:31:54.405]  It's not gonna be mommy.
[02:31:54.425 --> 02:31:56.146]  It's not gonna be grandpa.
[02:31:56.346 --> 02:31:57.366]  It's not gonna be your son.
[02:31:57.526 --> 02:31:58.547]  It's not gonna be your daughter.
[02:31:58.807 --> 02:32:02.008]  It's going to be the AI posing as your family member.
[02:32:02.208 --> 02:32:06.412]  And by the time it's ready for you to make the transition, everybody's doing it.
[02:32:06.472 --> 02:32:11.717]  It'll be all over the so-called news that's been directly to your head that, you know, look at Bob.
[02:32:11.858 --> 02:32:14.180]  He's 120, but he's out skiing in his new body.
[02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:15.181]  You can have a metal body.
[02:32:15.201 --> 02:32:16.142]  You can have a plastic body.
[02:32:16.162 --> 02:32:18.904]  You can have a humanoid grown for you in one of the great tanks.
[02:32:19.165 --> 02:32:21.467]  A whole new rollout of services for all of you.
[02:32:21.507 --> 02:32:25.251]  But we've just got to get past those Christians that warned 2,000 years ago it was coming.
[02:32:25.391 --> 02:32:26.512]  And once they're out of the way,
[02:32:26.792 --> 02:32:28.994]  We can enter the brave new world.
[02:32:29.014 --> 02:32:33.737]  The brave new world where you'll be so toxic and so poisoned, you've got to transition to even live.
[02:32:33.877 --> 02:32:35.298]  But you won't really live, you'll die.
[02:32:35.418 --> 02:32:40.221]  But in your free will, you will accept merging with the machine and your soul will be destroyed.
[02:32:40.261 --> 02:32:41.442]  It's a spiritual fight though.
[02:32:41.562 --> 02:32:48.447]  They're building this big glittery matrix to try to insert you into it, to trick you in it, to give up your soul and your free will.
[02:32:48.887 --> 02:32:54.591]  You have free will, you're made in the image of God, you're amazing, you have the entire potential of the universe in you.
[02:32:55.131 --> 02:32:57.552]  Don't let them steal it from you.
[02:32:58.213 --> 02:33:01.334]  Don't sell your soul for all this tinfoil crap.
[02:33:04.556 --> 02:33:10.479]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.281 --> 02:33:30.586]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.647 --> 02:33:41.254]  So how do you assault Western culture and the Renaissance that's truly liberal in the classical sense and egalitarian, trying to build people up, believing in humanity?
[02:33:42.135 --> 02:33:43.335]  You make ugly architecture.
[02:33:43.776 --> 02:33:44.676]  You attack the family.
[02:33:44.897 --> 02:33:45.817]  It's all declassified.
[02:33:46.538 --> 02:33:48.740]  And you start with political correctness.
[02:33:50.129 --> 02:33:50.950]  Things like Nazis.
[02:33:51.511 --> 02:33:54.615]  And then once you ban that, you move on to the family.
[02:33:54.735 --> 02:33:58.700]  You move on to people that say a man competing in women's sports is not a woman.
[02:33:59.301 --> 02:33:59.922]  You arrest them.
[02:34:00.803 --> 02:34:01.244]  Here it is.
[02:34:01.304 --> 02:34:06.991]  Guerrilla statute finally removed from Texas Park after two decades following complaints of racism.
[02:34:08.095 --> 02:34:11.897]  And it's a themed park that has giraffes and other things.
[02:34:12.317 --> 02:34:18.281]  Folks were nice enough to build for kids, like it's a zoo, but not living animals.
[02:34:18.301 --> 02:34:19.762]  Just a really classy, nice park.
[02:34:20.222 --> 02:34:24.004]  Well, a gorilla is racist.
[02:34:25.565 --> 02:34:28.487]  First, if you, you know, have monkey attire.
[02:34:29.707 --> 02:34:30.528]  Kids love monkeys.
[02:34:31.168 --> 02:34:32.169]  And saying, little monkey.
[02:34:32.189 --> 02:34:33.349]  You know, my daughter has a shirt.
[02:34:33.589 --> 02:34:35.631]  My youngest daughter says, little monkey.
[02:34:36.411 --> 02:34:49.181]  Well, if a store in South Africa shows a little black kid in a shirt saying, I'm the number one monkey, well, that's suddenly racist because you're projecting that people are saying black people look like monkeys.
[02:34:50.057 --> 02:34:52.558]  I mean, we humans are, I mean, we're made by God.
[02:34:52.598 --> 02:34:58.041]  I'm not saying we are an ape, but our DNA is, you know, I mean, we are the super smart killer apes.
[02:34:58.402 --> 02:35:02.544]  So, I mean, again, it's a war on reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:02.904 --> 02:35:04.125]  It's a war on words.
[02:35:04.185 --> 02:35:08.187]  It's a war on communication, where all these ignorant people don't know anything but interpreting
[02:35:09.633 --> 02:35:18.020]  They took down Martin Luther King statues and murals all over universities because he said all God's children, little boys, little girls, brown, yellow, red.
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:20.302]  So he didn't talk about trans or gay.
[02:35:20.422 --> 02:35:20.803]  Boom!
[02:35:21.724 --> 02:35:22.644]  It makes you holy.
[02:35:22.704 --> 02:35:23.505]  It makes you better than anybody.
[02:35:23.705 --> 02:35:24.866]  And then you can pull everything down.
[02:35:24.886 --> 02:35:25.827]  We're going back to Mark Dice.
[02:35:26.067 --> 02:35:28.970]  Talk about his new book shooting up towards number one on Amazon.
[02:35:29.090 --> 02:35:29.871]  You should all get it.
[02:35:31.372 --> 02:35:32.473]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[02:35:32.613 --> 02:35:33.093]  But first,
[02:35:34.045 --> 02:35:40.173]  I didn't plug even last hour, because Katie Hopkins was amazing, Mark's amazing, and if I don't, we'll go bankrupt, they'll shut us down, they'll win.
[02:35:40.914 --> 02:35:41.234]  Okay?
[02:35:41.334 --> 02:35:43.917]  So, when I plug, we fund ourselves.
[02:35:43.978 --> 02:35:44.658]  And I make it easy.
[02:35:44.738 --> 02:35:46.240]  T-shirts, books, films.
[02:35:46.561 --> 02:35:48.143]  We're going to be selling Mark's book, it's coming in.
[02:35:49.364 --> 02:35:51.207]  The point is, infowarestore.com.
[02:35:52.421 --> 02:35:55.782]  I gotta tell you, Alexa Pure Pro, other competitors are $350.
[02:35:56.482 --> 02:35:56.582]  It's $127.
[02:35:56.722 --> 02:35:58.002]  Normally it's $240.
[02:35:58.042 --> 02:36:02.463]  This is almost at cost, because they ordered too many towards the end of the year.
[02:36:02.863 --> 02:36:05.644]  They don't want to have to pay the taxes on inventory, just like car dealerships do.
[02:36:05.984 --> 02:36:07.825]  I've never seen it this low.
[02:36:08.165 --> 02:36:07.825]  $127.

[02:36:47.225 --> 02:36:50.366]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:36:50.806 --> 02:36:52.607]  You are what make it all possible.
[02:36:52.967 --> 02:36:54.667]  Okay, going back to Mark Deisch.
[02:36:54.848 --> 02:36:58.949]  Mark, I could ask a lot of questions here, but front and center, again, where are we going?
[02:36:58.969 --> 02:36:59.709]  We don't stop this.
[02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:01.130]  How do we stop it?
[02:37:01.410 --> 02:37:03.131]  They're stealing the election now in front of us.
[02:37:03.911 --> 02:37:10.617]  The left's answer to populism fighting globalism and winning every election across the world is, as I predicted, total fraud.
[02:37:10.637 --> 02:37:12.199]  They're doing it in front of God and country.
[02:37:12.919 --> 02:37:15.021]  They are, I mean, it is just wild.
[02:37:15.141 --> 02:37:16.543]  What's coming next, Mark Dyson?
[02:37:16.583 --> 02:37:17.564]  Tell us about liberalism.
[02:37:17.844 --> 02:37:18.545]  Find a cure.
[02:37:18.625 --> 02:37:19.586]  What an amazing title.
[02:37:19.666 --> 02:37:20.466]  All your books are great.
[02:37:20.747 --> 02:37:26.071]  I'm so proud of you that it's only been out a couple days and it's shooting towards number one now at 18 right now.
[02:37:26.152 --> 02:37:28.514]  So everyone is a political act, even though I hate Amazon.
[02:37:28.814 --> 02:37:30.857]  Because they rip off the authors and mark it's almost nothing.
[02:37:31.158 --> 02:37:35.244]  Should go there and buy Liberalism Find a Cure, read it, and then donate it to the library.
[02:37:35.545 --> 02:37:36.967]  A political act of resistance.
[02:37:37.007 --> 02:37:37.408]  Mark Dice.
[02:37:39.130 --> 02:37:42.212]  People have to stop apologizing to lunatics.
[02:37:42.952 --> 02:37:56.620]  We saw the head director of marketing for Victoria's Secret apologize for saying that he didn't want to have transgenders, or that it wasn't a problem that there were no transgender women in the Victoria's Secret Show.
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:03.384]  And then a day or two later, they apologized on their official account, said, oh, it's so sorry, and we'd love to have them in there.
[02:38:03.724 --> 02:38:05.065]  Because as Andrew Breitbart said,
[02:38:05.908 --> 02:38:07.889]  Politics is downstream from culture.
[02:38:08.310 --> 02:38:14.474]  So if the culture keeps getting polluted, we're going to see more and more laws that then prevent us from speaking out.
[02:38:14.854 --> 02:38:22.138]  In multiple states now, California included, on your driver's license, you can check that you're neither a man or a woman.
[02:38:22.219 --> 02:38:25.501]  Just an X or an NA for not available.
[02:38:26.121 --> 02:38:31.485]  And we don't have any sort of standards for, you know, what is a transgender man or a woman?
[02:38:31.545 --> 02:38:34.607]  And if somebody could just self-identify, what's going to stop anyone?
[02:38:35.547 --> 02:38:48.412]  This is a cult of the left saying, remember when Winston's being tortured by O'Brien?
[02:38:48.452 --> 02:38:51.234]  And he says, listen, we can suspend the laws of gravity if we want.
[02:38:51.794 --> 02:38:56.496]  And 2 plus 2 will be whatever I want it to be when I'm done wrecking your mind.
[02:38:57.416 --> 02:38:59.537]  And by the end, he thinks there's no gravity.
[02:38:59.737 --> 02:39:01.838]  He thinks 2 plus 2 equals whatever O'Brien says.
[02:39:02.178 --> 02:39:03.378]  This is brainwashing!
[02:39:03.838 --> 02:39:11.401]  When a cult says, there is no mother and father, there are no genders, there are no mother and father, there are no genders, you're in a brainwashing cult!
[02:39:12.219 --> 02:39:34.088]  They want you to believe that 2 plus 2 equals 5 and there's an organization that's lobbying Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers to stop referring to the women, the pregnant women, as women and as, you know, she and her because a gender non-conforming woman went in to get an abortion and she was offended that they were calling her a she.
[02:39:35.809 --> 02:39:56.489]  And they're even saying that it's wrong to say that women have periods, and men can get pregnant now, and if you even just use the caveat, you know, a transgender woman, or to make the distinction between an actual biological chromosomal individual, they're saying that that's discrimination and that's wrong as well.
[02:39:56.549 --> 02:40:00.312]  And again, it's always more, more, more, more, and Katie Hobbs was talking about at what point
[02:40:01.073 --> 02:40:01.774]  Is there a limit?
[02:40:02.095 --> 02:40:03.257]  And I don't think there is a limit.
[02:40:03.277 --> 02:40:05.961]  I think they're going to start saying, we choose to come kill you at your house.
[02:40:06.021 --> 02:40:07.764]  We call this giving you life.
[02:40:08.365 --> 02:40:10.449]  And then you'll be arrested if you don't let a leftist come kill you.
[02:40:11.294 --> 02:40:21.699]  Yeah, if we don't win this, the Christians are going to literally have to live like the Amish in our own little villages where we completely disconnect and are self-sufficient because we can't interact with these people.
[02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:23.921]  You can't send your kids to a public school.
[02:40:23.981 --> 02:40:25.601]  Are you kidding me?
[02:40:25.762 --> 02:40:32.365]  Mark, I've already come to that realization that if I really love my children, I have to move to the country and I have to literally disconnect from everything.
[02:40:32.425 --> 02:40:32.845]  It's true!
[02:40:32.905 --> 02:40:37.508]  I mean, we are literally going through what the Amish went through in Germany and Switzerland 500 years ago.
[02:40:39.534 --> 02:40:48.997]  Every day on social media or every week there's these far leftist trending topics that are artificially inflated or astroturfed or paid to present.
[02:40:49.557 --> 02:40:57.140]  Every time there's a new Disney movie out or a superhero movie out, the liberals are upset that the characters aren't gay or that they're not transgender.
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:04.646]  They were upset when one of the new Captain Americas came out because Captain America and his best friend Bucky, they didn't have a relationship.
[02:41:04.706 --> 02:41:07.308]  Well, in the comics, they're normal men.
[02:41:07.468 --> 02:41:13.693]  And even saying that heterosexuality is normal is considered to be hateful as well because how dare you say that that's normal.
[02:41:14.153 --> 02:41:15.794]  And so they want everything.
[02:41:16.014 --> 02:41:17.155]  They are just pushing.
[02:41:17.195 --> 02:41:18.957]  What this is, you just said it, pushing.
[02:41:19.057 --> 02:41:22.399]  It's a total saying you have no property even over your own mind.
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.704]  They're absolutely not letting you have any of your own territory or any of your own space.
[02:41:28.185 --> 02:41:34.271]  Just like, quote, sending in for career day in Colorado without telling the parents to teach kids to be a drag queen.
[02:41:34.591 --> 02:41:37.314]  Or if you're a boy, be a girl for your profession.
[02:41:37.534 --> 02:41:38.635]  Basically be a sex worker.
[02:41:39.056 --> 02:41:43.760]  And again, it's the religion of getting into your territory, not even telling you when they do it.
[02:41:43.941 --> 02:41:45.102]  It's all about disrespect.
[02:41:45.925 --> 02:41:56.012]  And if there's just one complaint, then corporations completely yield, afraid to upset or afraid to be labeled as non-inclusive.
[02:41:56.032 --> 02:41:59.614]  There was a university recently to celebrate Black History Month.
[02:41:59.974 --> 02:42:15.625]  Some of the chefs in the cafeteria set up a special menu to honor Black History Month with traditional black foods that included, of course, fried chicken and other foods that are traditionally associated with black people.
[02:42:15.845 --> 02:42:17.607]  That's the line I'm gonna be in.
[02:42:17.847 --> 02:42:18.508]  And it's delicious.
[02:42:18.528 --> 02:42:19.429]  Who doesn't like fried chicken?
[02:42:19.509 --> 02:42:19.850]  I love it.
[02:42:20.130 --> 02:42:20.991]  Watermelon.
[02:42:21.011 --> 02:42:21.672]  Totally delicious.
[02:42:22.012 --> 02:42:23.974]  But that was considered to be offensive.
[02:42:23.994 --> 02:42:24.455]  That's right.
[02:42:24.515 --> 02:42:26.698]  Even honoring, which is just Southern cooking.
[02:42:26.758 --> 02:42:28.099]  I mean, Mike, give me collard greens.
[02:42:28.159 --> 02:42:28.420]  Give me...
[02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:32.552]  It was probably white social justice warriors.
[02:42:32.592 --> 02:42:36.495]  Let me tell you, the so-called black cooking is what my grandma's both made, okay?
[02:42:36.555 --> 02:42:37.756]  It's not southern cooking.
[02:42:38.256 --> 02:42:38.577]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:38.597 --> 02:42:48.324]  The best part is the menu was set up by some black people in the cafeteria who did their best to honor their black heritage and the black foods that they like, but they said, oh, that's offensive.
[02:42:48.404 --> 02:42:49.404]  Sorry, can't do that.
[02:42:49.565 --> 02:42:50.145]  Gotta take it down.
[02:42:50.285 --> 02:42:52.027]  Because they're killing real black culture.
[02:42:52.047 --> 02:42:54.289]  They're making it leftist, poison, racist culture.
[02:42:54.669 --> 02:42:56.111]  No, celebrate all culture.
[02:42:56.351 --> 02:42:58.112]  Particularly black southern cooking.
[02:42:58.152 --> 02:43:00.475]  It's the barbeque, good lord, it's the best!
[02:43:02.336 --> 02:43:05.880]  You know why I love President Trump so much?
[02:43:07.173 --> 02:43:09.115]  It's because I know he's for real.
[02:43:09.695 --> 02:43:10.856]  He's trying the best he can.
[02:43:11.196 --> 02:43:15.019]  He's gotten so much done despite the enemies arrayed against him.
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:20.744]  And I've been really persecuted at a level we've never experienced before.
[02:43:22.718 --> 02:43:24.280]  50 times the level I've ever experienced.
[02:43:25.021 --> 02:43:27.743]  The demonization, the lies, the harassment, the fake lawsuits.
[02:43:28.584 --> 02:43:29.545]  Because I've supported Trump.
[02:43:30.566 --> 02:43:31.187]  Now why is that?
[02:43:31.407 --> 02:43:37.593]  It's because Trump supports the idea of the nation-state, a pro-human future, not a globalist technocracy.
[02:43:38.374 --> 02:43:39.616]  And he really does love this country.
[02:43:40.096 --> 02:43:50.410]  And nation-states stand in the way of mega-corporations allied with authoritarian regimes like China and the EU, dominating and oppressing and controlling populations.
[02:43:50.970 --> 02:43:54.835]  These people lust after controlling and running our lives.
[02:43:54.895 --> 02:43:55.576]  They want power.
[02:43:56.677 --> 02:44:04.179]  I just wanted to state here, with this being the week of Thanksgiving, that I am extremely thankful for President Trump, and I stand with President Trump.
[02:44:05.139 --> 02:44:08.520]  And I'm also extremely thankful to all of you out there.
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:12.521]  And I'm appreciative of you, and I love you, and I want to thank you.
[02:44:13.201 --> 02:44:16.382]  And I'm very, very humble for the support and the prayers.
[02:44:17.202 --> 02:44:39.792]  For all of you that have stood with them for wars over the years, and put up with my annex sometimes when I get off the rails, none of us are perfect, and I just want you to know that we are all unified in our love of God, our love of justice, our love of freedom, our love of the rule of law, our love of sovereignty, and this great experience of human life we're all experiencing together, and the long saga, the long march of humanity towards freedom.
[02:44:40.812 --> 02:44:44.016]  And the last 244 years of the American experience.
[02:44:44.657 --> 02:44:46.299]  What our ancestors have gone through together.
[02:44:46.319 --> 02:44:48.902]  America's destiny is very, very special.
[02:44:49.883 --> 02:44:51.264]  So no matter where you are in the world or...
[02:44:52.506 --> 02:44:54.347]  What color you are or even what your religion is.
[02:44:55.008 --> 02:45:00.772]  If you have a sense of justice and a sense of wanting to stand up for the innocent and wanting to build a better world.
[02:45:01.552 --> 02:45:09.838]  And you understand that evil people come in and manipulate that goodness in our heart so that we give up our will, our free will, to them.
[02:45:10.419 --> 02:45:15.002]  So these vampires can direct us when they don't have consciences, but they know we have consciences.
[02:45:15.022 --> 02:45:16.083]  So it's a very
[02:45:18.021 --> 02:45:28.726]  Delicate balance between being loving and being open and wanting to help people and being deceived and manipulated by bad people to end up doing evil things.
[02:45:29.566 --> 02:45:38.850]  But with Trump and with the American people, what you see with nationalism and patriotism and Christianity reawakening around the world, it's a very, very, very special time.
[02:45:39.490 --> 02:45:40.571]  And this is real.
[02:45:40.891 --> 02:45:42.232]  And we're all in this together.
[02:45:42.552 --> 02:45:44.573]  And Trump is fighting to deliver
[02:45:45.613 --> 02:45:46.735]  And to not betray.
[02:45:47.056 --> 02:45:49.679]  But he's not perfect and he can't act alone.
[02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:51.482]  He can't do this on his own.
[02:45:51.963 --> 02:45:54.186]  And so we shouldn't be two-faced, any of us.
[02:45:55.087 --> 02:45:57.551]  When we're friends and family and neighbors.
[02:45:58.011 --> 02:46:01.376]  And virtue signal when they attack Trump and throw him under the bus.
[02:46:01.897 --> 02:46:12.021]  We have to stand up for Trump when that happens because he is a microcosm or an archetype or a figurehead of the spirit of resistance and who we are.
[02:46:12.682 --> 02:46:19.724]  And when we don't sit there and deny the fact that we respect and love him, it gives the enemy power.
[02:46:19.744 --> 02:46:24.526]  So we have to stand and be strong in the face of these bullies and say we're not backing down.
[02:46:24.767 --> 02:46:26.187]  And you have supported InfoWars.
[02:46:26.687 --> 02:46:27.628]  You've made it all possible.
[02:46:28.368 --> 02:46:31.009]  And so I want to thank all of you out there for what you've done.
[02:46:31.029 --> 02:46:33.109]  And I want to remind some of those out there that get depressed.
[02:46:33.169 --> 02:46:34.050]  I know I do sometimes.
[02:46:34.530 --> 02:46:35.650]  This is a long journey.
[02:46:36.470 --> 02:46:40.291]  And good ruling this planet is not going to be easy.
[02:46:40.611 --> 02:46:43.652]  That's why it's the Animated Contest of Liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[02:46:43.692 --> 02:46:45.233]  But we've done incredible things.
[02:46:45.413 --> 02:46:46.633]  We've come from way behind.
[02:46:46.973 --> 02:46:48.834]  Now the enemy's launching their counter-assault.
[02:46:49.974 --> 02:46:51.515]  And we're living in history right now.
[02:46:52.015 --> 02:46:52.735]  God bless you all.
[02:46:52.755 --> 02:46:53.775]  Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.
[02:46:54.195 --> 02:46:56.176]  And again, thank you all for your support of InfoWars.
[02:47:04.867 --> 02:47:08.970]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:09.511 --> 02:47:10.832]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:18.478 --> 02:47:19.999]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.

[02:47:20.699 --> 02:47:21.780]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:22.781]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:23.322 --> 02:47:26.924]  Coming up, Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom is ready to go.
[02:47:28.638 --> 02:47:29.959]  Mark Dice is a busy guy.
[02:47:29.979 --> 02:47:30.719]  He's hard to get on.
[02:47:31.519 --> 02:47:34.341]  But he says now that the book is done, he's going to be on a lot more.
[02:47:34.761 --> 02:47:35.861]  And let me tell you, I'm very excited.
[02:47:35.882 --> 02:47:37.742]  He's had some books that have done very, very well.
[02:47:38.183 --> 02:47:46.407]  But this new one, Liberalism Find a Cure, just came out the last few days and it's already hit number 18 total books on Amazon.
[02:47:46.947 --> 02:47:48.848]  Now, I don't want to discourage things here, but
[02:47:49.770 --> 02:47:55.374]  Every time we've seen this from somebody else that's a patriot, they then just cheat it and knock it to 2,000 or something.
[02:47:55.414 --> 02:47:56.554]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:47:56.614 --> 02:47:57.415]  People know the truth.
[02:47:57.855 --> 02:47:59.456]  It's just the rigging.
[02:47:59.476 --> 02:48:04.460]  I mean, we thought two and a half years ago during the election, the rigging was bad, taking out negative search terms about Hillary.
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:08.262]  Now, it's like you said earlier, it's just insane.
[02:48:08.282 --> 02:48:11.864]  And like you said, I said, Mark, you did great man on the street to show how crazy leftists are.
[02:48:11.904 --> 02:48:15.527]  But since you started doing political commentary all the time, it's as good as it gets.
[02:48:16.207 --> 02:48:18.211]  It's what the late-night comics wish they were doing.
[02:48:19.513 --> 02:48:21.517]  And so it's very, very exciting.
[02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:24.763]  And I just hear popularity just rising and rising.
[02:48:24.783 --> 02:48:26.186]  That makes me feel good.
[02:48:26.927 --> 02:48:27.969]  But then I ask myself...
[02:48:29.918 --> 02:48:31.959]  Again, how insane can this get?
[02:48:32.239 --> 02:48:33.359]  What do you think about Trump?
[02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:36.961]  You said during the break, hey, I've been more positive the last two years since Trump's in.
[02:48:37.281 --> 02:48:39.762]  So have I. I've gotten behind him because he's for real.
[02:48:39.822 --> 02:48:41.763]  But now we see them stealing the election.
[02:48:42.043 --> 02:48:43.764]  Now we see them getting even worse than they were.
[02:48:44.044 --> 02:48:46.325]  And at this point, this is war.
[02:48:46.465 --> 02:48:48.446]  I mean, it's really flipped some switches in my brain.
[02:48:49.591 --> 02:48:54.997]  Well, never before has your show's name, InfoWars, been more appropriate, because it is an information war.
[02:48:55.137 --> 02:48:56.498]  And, you know, we were talking during the break.
[02:48:57.179 --> 02:48:58.020]  It's glad to be on your show.
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:58.661]  I love talking with you.
[02:48:58.681 --> 02:49:04.066]  A lot of the audience may not know, but I've been a guest on your show for 13 years, back all the way to 2005.
[02:49:04.447 --> 02:49:09.132]  And, you know, it's great to be on the show, great to be a part of the broadcast.
[02:49:09.732 --> 02:49:24.568]  And since Trump won in 2016, you know, my YouTube channel has sort of taken a slightly different direction, so it's great to do interviews where people can see kind of the serious side to me, because maybe a lot of people may think that I'm just like to joke around and be sarcastic, but I am a pretty serious guy.
[02:49:24.588 --> 02:49:25.189]  I'm a big nerd.
[02:49:25.229 --> 02:49:25.889]  I like writing books.
[02:49:25.909 --> 02:49:26.190]  This is my
[02:49:26.830 --> 02:49:27.731]  12th book?
[02:49:27.971 --> 02:49:28.431]  13th book?
[02:49:28.932 --> 02:49:29.592]  I lost track.
[02:49:30.093 --> 02:49:44.503]  And, you know, you can't help but look at what the liberals are doing and really just shake your head and laugh at it because it is, in many cases, impossible to distinguish what they're doing from sarcasm or from a parody.
[02:49:44.803 --> 02:49:51.908]  And that's why we're seeing some trolls on 4chan just making up certain things and saying that symbols and, you know,
[02:49:52.348 --> 02:49:54.870]  Milk is a symbol of their white supremacy.
[02:49:55.370 --> 02:50:00.793]  And then seeing that being taken as serious, that's how crazy the culture has gotten.
[02:50:00.853 --> 02:50:02.414]  So we are in a culture war.
[02:50:02.795 --> 02:50:03.915]  We're in the information war.
[02:50:04.015 --> 02:50:14.402]  And if we don't win this, we're going to sink down into a dystopian nightmare worse than 1984 because the technology wasn't there like we have now.
[02:50:14.462 --> 02:50:17.544]  And we've been seeing it get worse every day, every week.
[02:50:18.146 --> 02:50:20.035]  And you can only imagine what it's going to be.
[02:50:20.336 --> 02:50:22.447]  They may make it to a point where...
[02:50:23.323 --> 02:50:28.967]  It looks like your viewers are watching your content or liking it or responding to it, but they're not even seeing it.
[02:50:29.547 --> 02:50:38.293]  And they may get to a point where if you just say, you know, you don't, you don't think that a transgender, you know, woman is, is a, you know, a natural woman and they'll ban you.
[02:50:38.513 --> 02:50:44.897]  Just like last Christmas, there was a race car driver who said, told his nephew that boys don't wear princess dresses.
[02:50:44.958 --> 02:50:49.240]  His boy, his nephew was wearing a Disney dress after Christmas morning.
[02:50:49.681 --> 02:50:51.342]  And he said, Hey, what are you doing?
[02:50:51.362 --> 02:50:52.903]  You know, like boys don't wear dresses.
[02:50:54.684 --> 02:51:01.911]  It's a total attack on parenthood.
[02:51:01.991 --> 02:51:03.693]  It's a total takeover.
[02:51:04.113 --> 02:51:05.334]  I want to get your take on this.
[02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:08.357]  All Paul did, as you know, last week, was zoom in on Acosta.
[02:51:09.389 --> 02:51:10.370]  People say, oh, it's a petty story.
[02:51:10.390 --> 02:51:11.130]  Why do you keep covering it?
[02:51:11.410 --> 02:51:13.672]  They made it the number one story in the country for two days.
[02:51:14.252 --> 02:51:15.773]  Not the election thieving any of it.
[02:51:16.474 --> 02:51:17.354]  And he didn't slow it up.
[02:51:17.414 --> 02:51:18.135]  He didn't speed it.
[02:51:19.696 --> 02:51:20.416]  He didn't do any of that.
[02:51:20.476 --> 02:51:22.178]  All he did was blow it up, as the president said.
[02:51:22.398 --> 02:51:26.340]  But all the corporate media went with it, called for Huckabee Sanders to be fired.
[02:51:26.821 --> 02:51:33.085]  And even the Dallas Morning News, the local paper here in Austin, said Jones is horrible, next level lying, fake video.
[02:51:33.185 --> 02:51:34.506]  Acosta didn't even touch her.
[02:51:34.766 --> 02:51:35.426]  But here's the key.
[02:51:35.787 --> 02:51:39.249]  Hundreds of papers I saw didn't even show the video or a link.
[02:51:39.529 --> 02:51:40.830]  So now they don't even show you.
[02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:43.471]  They go, look at this doctored video, but we're not going to show it to you.
[02:51:43.731 --> 02:51:45.733]  This is beyond 1984 now.
[02:51:47.013 --> 02:51:48.574]  Jim Acosta is a protester.
[02:51:48.594 --> 02:51:49.655]  He's not a reporter.
[02:51:49.795 --> 02:51:52.656]  He has no business being anywhere close to the president.
[02:51:52.716 --> 02:51:53.877]  He is a heckler.
[02:51:54.277 --> 02:52:04.023]  I put together a compilation on my YouTube channel last week showing just a small fraction of the instances of him just yelling out of turn, being shushed by fellow reporters.
[02:52:04.623 --> 02:52:08.567]  And CNN is now suing the White House in order to try to get the press pass back.
[02:52:08.928 --> 02:52:13.793]  And I'm sorry, Mr. Acosta, but the First Amendment doesn't mean that you'll be invited to the White House.
[02:52:13.833 --> 02:52:18.858]  It means that the White House won't stop you from spewing your insanity on your own private property.
[02:52:19.378 --> 02:52:27.727]  And if Jim Acosta is allowed to be on the White House property after the White House says, you know, we don't want you here, you're disruptive.
[02:52:28.067 --> 02:52:33.974]  What's to stop anyone and everyone from going, why don't I have a right to be in the White House press corps then?
[02:52:33.994 --> 02:52:37.078]  They're discriminating against me, I'm a media analyst, why can't I be there?
[02:52:37.782 --> 02:52:38.383]  It's insane.
[02:52:38.523 --> 02:52:41.645]  He's a performance artist and a heckler.
[02:52:42.305 --> 02:52:48.729]  And I don't know how anyone can watch CNN without getting a headache because it is absolutely nauseating.
[02:52:48.810 --> 02:52:54.053]  And Anderson Cooper's making about $40,000 per day, per show.
[02:52:54.333 --> 02:52:57.115]  People should know how much money these talking heads are making.
[02:52:57.155 --> 02:52:58.076]  Same with Megyn Kelly.
[02:52:59.537 --> 02:53:05.363]  $40,000 a day to sit there and read a teleprompter and then comment about how bad Trump is.
[02:53:05.763 --> 02:53:15.853]  And that's why they took you down because you were too large, really the largest independent media operation, eclipsing them on all fronts, and they couldn't have that.
[02:53:16.233 --> 02:53:19.236]  And that's why they started demonizing me right after.
[02:53:19.316 --> 02:53:21.819]  I saw a report from PBS said that, well,
[02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:28.748]  Alex has spawned countless imitators and they're selling merchandise and they showed me... Oh no!
[02:53:28.828 --> 02:53:30.109]  Let's stop them immediately!
[02:53:30.149 --> 02:53:31.431]  Let's not let them have any economy!
[02:53:31.631 --> 02:53:32.573]  Don't just take their speech!
[02:53:32.693 --> 02:53:33.894]  Take their bank accounts away!
[02:53:34.195 --> 02:53:34.635]  And by the way...
[02:53:35.815 --> 02:53:39.136]  He famously was the only heir to the Vanderbilt fortune.
[02:53:39.156 --> 02:53:42.678]  It's so big and so secret, it's rumored to be in the trillions.
[02:53:43.278 --> 02:53:45.999]  So, yeah, there's people worth trillions, okay?
[02:53:46.579 --> 02:53:50.041]  Cooper is at least worth $300-400 billion.
[02:53:50.361 --> 02:53:52.382]  People go, oh, the richest man in the world is worth $120 billion.
[02:53:52.462 --> 02:53:52.902]  No, folks.
[02:53:53.242 --> 02:53:55.603]  This is a trillionaire, okay?
[02:53:55.663 --> 02:54:00.385]  And so he's given a show with no ratings to sit up there because, just like
[02:54:01.621 --> 02:54:09.257]  I mean just like Tim Cook, it's like it doesn't matter he's a trillionaire, doesn't matter he's in the CIA, doesn't matter he supports Communist China killing people, he's gay so it's cool.
[02:54:10.270 --> 02:54:16.393]  Part of the left's plan undermining our culture is attacking all of our holidays and Thanksgiving is next week.
[02:54:16.793 --> 02:54:20.835]  There isn't really a single holiday that they don't completely assault.
[02:54:21.195 --> 02:54:25.717]  They're upset about Thanksgiving because of what the pilgrims supposedly did to the natives.
[02:54:26.157 --> 02:54:29.059]  Christmas is a white Christian holiday.
[02:54:29.399 --> 02:54:32.840]  They want Santa Claus to be black and have a boyfriend.
[02:54:32.860 --> 02:54:36.302]  There's really a children's book about that that came out last year.
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:45.243]  Valentine's Day they're upset about because it celebrates heterosexual couples and traditional gender roles.
[02:54:45.803 --> 02:54:50.525]  Mother's Day, Father's Day, makes the single parents feel bad.
[02:54:50.865 --> 02:54:52.706]  It makes same-sex
[02:54:53.886 --> 02:55:00.449]  Parents feel bad because all the cards and all the commercials are about a man and a woman.
[02:55:00.769 --> 02:55:01.609]  That's bad.
[02:55:01.649 --> 02:55:09.412]  So they're trying to literally tear apart the basic foundation of society, which is the nuclear family.
[02:55:09.773 --> 02:55:15.775]  And with so many children being raised by single parents, who were raised by single parents, who were raised by single parents,
[02:55:16.375 --> 02:55:25.444]  Being raised by social media now today being so disconnected from the traditional value structure and Teaching systems of the family.
[02:55:25.464 --> 02:55:31.369]  We're dealing with rudderless people and the IQs are physically dropping People are becoming extremely stupid.
[02:55:31.389 --> 02:55:38.336]  So those of us that have a brain we see this and it's asinine But Acosta can show the same video and say I didn't touch her and he is touching her.
[02:55:38.376 --> 02:55:39.316]  He's pushing and
[02:55:40.198 --> 02:55:45.934]  And pulling away, and they're so brainwashed they just go, okay, he didn't touch her and it's doctored video even though it's not.
[02:55:46.034 --> 02:55:47.899]  I mean, this is just incredible!
[02:55:49.588 --> 02:55:53.829]  The fact that CNN says they're the most trusted name in news, everything is the opposite.
[02:55:53.949 --> 02:55:55.390]  It is like a bizarro world.
[02:55:55.410 --> 02:55:57.611]  They accuse Trump of being divisive.
[02:55:57.651 --> 02:55:59.711]  They accuse Trump of inciting hatred.
[02:56:00.292 --> 02:56:08.094]  Name a Trump supporter who's not a little bit anxious to walk down the street or go into a bar wearing a Make America Great Again hat or a Trump shirt.
[02:56:08.394 --> 02:56:10.375]  You're literally putting yourself at risk.
[02:56:11.130 --> 02:56:16.293]  Name a liberal who is concerned about wearing, you know, some leftist Bernie shirt.
[02:56:16.333 --> 02:56:16.953]  Nobody cares.
[02:56:17.153 --> 02:56:18.374]  Somebody might snicker at them.
[02:56:18.434 --> 02:56:18.814]  That's it.
[02:56:19.094 --> 02:56:21.055]  But they're not going to be put in physical danger.
[02:56:21.535 --> 02:56:23.076]  They are the ones causing the problems.
[02:56:23.116 --> 02:56:28.019]  They're undermining our culture, our country, our holidays, the family.
[02:56:28.439 --> 02:56:32.121]  It is an all-out assault and it is a mental health
[02:56:32.541 --> 02:56:33.122]  We're good.
[02:56:47.678 --> 02:56:51.000]  Human sacrifice by the Aztecs, cutting their children's hearts out.
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:57.644]  Crazies get in charge and they make people do more and more and more until the lemmings are all throwing their kids off cliffs to Booga Nooga.
[02:56:58.024 --> 02:57:05.468]  And every culture goes crazy sometime, and you're right, we've gone crazy, but it's been scientifically directed to sabotage us.
[02:57:06.009 --> 02:57:11.472]  And, you know, I've come up with a saying, you can probably put it better than I, but leftists aren't Americans.
[02:57:13.015 --> 02:57:13.617]  They really aren't.
[02:57:13.717 --> 02:57:17.466]  Their ethos is hating the nation-state, hating success, hating the family.
[02:57:17.787 --> 02:57:18.429]  But it's beyond that.
[02:57:18.890 --> 02:57:21.175]  Leftists are demons.
[02:57:22.210 --> 02:57:26.412]  And have you noticed that every Christian is immune to the liberal pathogen?
[02:57:26.592 --> 02:57:32.055]  Christians are the patriots who love America, love the Constitution, love their family, love their neighbor as themselves.
[02:57:32.275 --> 02:57:36.057]  Even as flawed as we are, we are still adhering to that goal.
[02:57:36.157 --> 02:57:38.418]  Mark, I know you gotta go, but do five more minutes with us and watch this.
[02:57:38.438 --> 02:57:44.921]  Come on, I want you to finish the key, because it's true, I've always been a Christian, but now it's totally clear it's a fight between good and evil, period.
[02:57:45.201 --> 02:57:47.762]  Mark Dice is our guest for five more than Paul Watson.
[02:57:48.142 --> 02:57:49.343]  Stay with us at NewsWars.com.
[02:57:52.803 --> 02:57:57.937]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:58:00.245 --> 02:58:01.806]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[02:58:01.846 --> 02:58:02.466]  It's a good thing.
[02:58:02.486 --> 02:58:05.708]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:58:06.269 --> 02:58:08.690]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[02:58:08.710 --> 02:58:09.771]  I learned what the best was.
[02:58:10.471 --> 02:58:23.720]  And Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:29.183]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[02:58:29.363 --> 02:58:33.809]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[02:58:34.309 --> 02:58:36.672]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[02:58:37.353 --> 02:58:41.739]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[02:58:43.394 --> 02:58:45.095]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:58:45.856 --> 02:58:48.138]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[02:58:48.158 --> 02:58:55.583]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[02:58:55.783 --> 02:58:58.506]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[02:58:59.086 --> 02:59:01.067]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[02:59:01.208 --> 02:59:02.048]  Texas has that too.
[02:59:02.549 --> 02:59:06.311]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[02:59:06.872 --> 02:59:09.694]  So he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:59:12.230 --> 02:59:16.233]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[02:59:16.593 --> 02:59:18.654]  We normally sell for $249, it's a great deal.
[02:59:18.674 --> 02:59:20.375]  When it's this child, usually $200.
[02:59:20.815 --> 02:59:20.975]  It's $127!
[02:59:22.657 --> 02:59:27.600]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[02:59:28.527 --> 02:59:29.608]  I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[02:59:29.668 --> 02:59:31.770]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[02:59:31.810 --> 02:59:32.771]  I mean, I'm all for great deals.
[02:59:32.951 --> 02:59:33.992]  This is insane.
[02:59:34.333 --> 02:59:36.114]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:59:36.535 --> 02:59:38.517]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family.
[02:59:38.537 --> 02:59:39.918]  Get the best, the best deal.
[02:59:40.299 --> 02:59:42.521]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[02:59:42.621 --> 02:59:43.141]  It's amazing.
[02:59:43.221 --> 02:59:49.247]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:57.222 --> 03:00:03.686]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:04.507 --> 03:00:06.228]  We want your soul!
[03:00:06.548 --> 03:00:09.850]  We want your soul!
[03:00:10.131 --> 03:00:13.473]  We want your soul!
[03:00:13.833 --> 03:00:18.016]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:00:18.736 --> 03:00:20.197]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.317 --> 03:00:22.399]  Show us your habits, your facts,
[03:00:24.585 --> 03:00:27.826]  Mr. President, will you stop calling us the enemy of the people, sir?
[03:00:28.706 --> 03:00:31.727]  Will you stop calling the press the enemy of the people, sir?
[03:00:32.588 --> 03:00:39.770]  Mr. President, will you stop calling the press the enemy of the people, sir?
[03:00:39.930 --> 03:00:42.331]  Everybody, thank you.
[03:00:43.356 --> 03:00:53.863]  Mr. President, Mr. President, if there is no collusion, Mr. President, if there is no collusion, why does Rudy Giuliani consider there is no crime in collusion?
[03:00:53.903 --> 03:01:01.228]  Mr. President, Mr. President, do you think other countries should not allow children to stay with their parents?
[03:01:01.548 --> 03:01:02.089]  We're leaving.
[03:01:02.109 --> 03:01:02.849]  Come on, Jim.
[03:01:02.889 --> 03:01:03.190]  Go.
[03:01:03.230 --> 03:01:03.630]  We're done.
[03:01:22.918 --> 03:01:27.704]  Credentials pulled that, you know, that had come down from people high level in the administration.
[03:01:27.864 --> 03:01:29.766]  We had a contact as well through one of our crew.
[03:01:29.786 --> 03:01:31.108]  They got our press passes.
[03:01:31.128 --> 03:01:31.888]  We were totally polite.
[03:01:33.061 --> 03:01:36.182]  And CNN said, oh my God, look, they're in the building and got us banned.
[03:01:36.322 --> 03:01:38.562]  And now they're suing because the heckler Jim Acosta.
[03:01:38.582 --> 03:01:39.643]  But I don't want to go into that anymore.
[03:01:39.663 --> 03:01:41.143]  I just thought I'd play that because Mark mentioned it.
[03:01:41.583 --> 03:01:45.004]  Mark, in the three and a half minutes we have left, it's a fight between good and evil.
[03:01:45.044 --> 03:01:45.744]  I mean, it really is.
[03:01:45.764 --> 03:01:48.925]  These people desire to abort children.
[03:01:48.945 --> 03:01:50.285]  They desire to molest children.
[03:01:50.325 --> 03:01:52.746]  The Pope has now said, don't investigate pedophilia.
[03:01:52.766 --> 03:01:53.886]  He ordered it in the U.S.
[03:01:54.846 --> 03:01:56.066]  This is not a Christian leader.
[03:01:56.086 --> 03:01:58.187]  I mean, they're really showing who they are.
[03:01:59.722 --> 03:02:08.274]  It is a battle between good and evil and it's just like the Bible says in the end times what's good will be considered evil and what's evil will be considered good.
[03:02:08.814 --> 03:02:17.006]  You can see the beginning stages or perhaps even the middle phase of setting up the beast system where you can't buy and sell unless you worship the beast because
[03:02:17.586 --> 03:02:28.554]  If they're going to ban people from doing commerce, ban you from social media, ban you from doing banking, ban you from talking on the phone because they don't like what you say, people aren't going to speak out.
[03:02:28.594 --> 03:02:33.958]  A lot of people are going to see what happened to you and see what happens to others and say, well, I'm not going to say anything.
[03:02:34.038 --> 03:02:35.740]  I don't want to get my account shut down.
[03:02:36.300 --> 03:02:38.382]  And that's what they're setting up now.
[03:02:38.782 --> 03:02:43.926]  And it's interesting because Christians are spiritually immune to this madness.
[03:02:44.406 --> 03:02:46.569]  Christians are the ones who've been warning about this.
[03:02:46.930 --> 03:02:55.642]  Christians are the ones who are watching this unfold and denouncing it for what it is, a spiritual sickness, because the leftists
[03:02:56.454 --> 03:02:57.174]  They hate God.
[03:02:57.414 --> 03:02:58.335]  They hate the family.
[03:02:58.695 --> 03:02:59.555]  They hate America.
[03:02:59.595 --> 03:03:06.018]  You see them chanting, you know, no U.S., no borders, no Trump, no USA at all, whatever their chant is.
[03:03:06.379 --> 03:03:07.799]  They don't like the country.
[03:03:08.019 --> 03:03:09.020]  They don't like our culture.
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:10.180]  They don't like our Bill of Rights.
[03:03:10.260 --> 03:03:12.061]  They want a mob rule.
[03:03:12.381 --> 03:03:13.962]  They hate the freedom of speech.
[03:03:14.182 --> 03:03:15.543]  They hate the Second Amendment.
[03:03:15.883 --> 03:03:18.084]  They hate a trial by a jury of your peers.
[03:03:18.764 --> 03:03:22.347]  They are the enemies of America.
[03:03:22.688 --> 03:03:24.109]  They're the enemies of humanity.
[03:03:24.129 --> 03:03:28.713]  And now, from Fox News to CNN, they're saying, you will take chips.
[03:03:28.853 --> 03:03:29.934]  You will accept it.
[03:03:29.974 --> 03:03:34.438]  I mean, they're literally, like, following Revelation, but as an owner's manual.
[03:03:34.458 --> 03:03:36.680]  They're following 1984, but as an owner's manual.
[03:03:38.129 --> 03:03:40.851]  And that's why they're trying to create an artificially intelligent God.
[03:03:40.931 --> 03:03:58.501]  And, you know, you can really go way down the rabbit hole, aside from just the typical cultural insanity and the political problems, to what their ultimate goal is, is to create an artificially intelligent system to wire humans into it, to turn mankind into something better.
[03:03:59.923 --> 03:04:10.424]  15 years ago we did because you're going out their own statements now Elon Musk talks like Mark Geiser Alex Jones and and so they have to take me off the air that try to restrict you because people are gonna go wait they warned us of all this
[03:04:11.502 --> 03:04:14.723]  I wrote a book about this called The Resistance Manifesto in 2005.
[03:04:14.763 --> 03:04:18.945]  That was when the resistance was fighting against the New World Order, not the foot soldiers of it.
[03:04:19.085 --> 03:04:25.467]  And there was a whole chapter in there on artificial intelligence, transhumanism, robot soldiers.
[03:04:25.507 --> 03:04:26.327]  And I was laughed at.
[03:04:26.367 --> 03:04:28.728]  People said, oh, you just watch too many Terminator movies.
[03:04:28.808 --> 03:04:34.870]  And now we have Atlas, the robot dogs, and the humanoid robot being manufactured.
[03:04:34.890 --> 03:04:36.111]  And that's just what they're telling us.
[03:04:36.291 --> 03:04:38.812]  Mark Dice, markdice.com, your new book.
[03:04:39.612 --> 03:04:40.913]  Always great to be with you, Alex.
[03:05:03.690 --> 03:05:09.072]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[03:05:09.332 --> 03:05:10.893]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[03:05:10.933 --> 03:05:11.533]  It's a good thing.
[03:05:11.573 --> 03:05:14.794]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:05:15.174 --> 03:05:17.515]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[03:05:17.555 --> 03:05:18.676]  I learned what the best was.
[03:05:19.056 --> 03:05:24.098]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[03:05:24.198 --> 03:05:24.738]  It's amazing.
[03:05:24.918 --> 03:05:27.260]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[03:05:27.480 --> 03:05:34.166]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply, that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:05:34.326 --> 03:05:35.948]  He has a glut of them.
[03:05:35.988 --> 03:05:38.350]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[03:05:38.410 --> 03:05:39.451]  When it's discharged, usually $200.
[03:05:39.911 --> 03:05:40.032]  It's $127!
[03:05:40.072 --> 03:05:45.096]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[03:05:48.519 --> 03:05:50.300]  So, they're gonna sell out very, very quickly.
[03:05:50.641 --> 03:05:52.862]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[03:05:52.963 --> 03:05:53.483]  It's amazing.
[03:05:53.563 --> 03:06:00.408]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:06:00.448 --> 03:06:11.717]  Big Brother.
[03:06:13.098 --> 03:06:14.319]  Mainstream Media.
[03:06:15.880 --> 03:06:16.981]  Government Cover Ups.
[03:06:18.482 --> 03:06:19.402]  You want answers?
[03:06:20.403 --> 03:06:22.223]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:22.303 --> 03:06:30.447]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:30.467 --> 03:06:37.389]  Major newspapers are running headlines like, Orange Buffoon in the White House tells us votes shouldn't be counted.
[03:06:37.429 --> 03:06:45.432]  Yeah, not when they show up in 18-wheelers, but Democratic Party operatives that literally work for MoveOn.org and George Soros and Hillary are doing it.
[03:06:45.652 --> 03:06:47.173]  I mean, this is just insane.
[03:06:47.813 --> 03:06:53.474]  I guess they'll be counting forever now in these special Democrat districts and just, they'll get as many votes as they need to overturn.
[03:06:53.815 --> 03:06:55.575]  Senate races, outraces, they're doing it.
[03:06:55.615 --> 03:07:00.636]  They're stealing the country right now as the president prepares a major shake-up.
[03:07:00.896 --> 03:07:05.358]  Paul Watson's taken over in literally about, I don't know, 120 seconds or so.
[03:07:06.538 --> 03:07:14.760]  Please, do yourself a major favor by supporting Infowars that supports liberty and supports basic freedom.
[03:07:16.701 --> 03:07:22.884]  Do yourself a favor and filter your water and filter your air with the very best units out there for the lowest prices.
[03:07:24.445 --> 03:07:26.806]  Do yourself a favor and get supplements that are game-changing.
[03:07:27.306 --> 03:07:28.007]  Get t-shirts.
[03:07:28.127 --> 03:07:30.648]  We're going to meet like-minded people or maybe get assaulted by the left.
[03:07:31.068 --> 03:07:37.792]  You wear a Trump-Pence shirt or an InfoWars shirt, but we have others that are Moe Enlave and things that uneducated, ignorant leftists won't even understand.
[03:07:37.812 --> 03:07:39.393]  You'll only meet like-minded people.
[03:07:39.413 --> 03:07:40.333]  It's a great way to spread the word.
[03:07:40.573 --> 03:07:45.176]  Whatever you do, visit InfoWarsStore.com and do your Christmas shopping there.
[03:07:45.236 --> 03:07:45.696]  Do it early.
[03:07:48.550 --> 03:07:54.192]  Alexa Pure Water Filtration is the best out there.
[03:07:54.673 --> 03:07:55.873]  We carry two brands.
[03:07:57.314 --> 03:08:00.655]  And the other brand is great too, Pro Pure.
[03:08:00.815 --> 03:08:01.736]  They're apples and oranges.
[03:08:02.696 --> 03:08:04.297]  Like this one does this chemical down to 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
[03:08:15.416 --> 03:08:21.198]  An Alexa Pure Pro, that's their biggest nice stainless steel system, gravity fed system, is $247.
[03:08:21.378 --> 03:08:23.059]  That's a great deal.
[03:08:23.099 --> 03:08:25.239]  Leading competitors for something of this quality are $300, $400.
[03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:32.382]  They're doing it because they ordered so many of these, they don't want to pay for the inventory at the end of year.
[03:08:33.842 --> 03:08:36.503]  You know, most states and the feds charge you for your inventory.
[03:08:37.724 --> 03:08:40.585]  That's why everybody tries to always sell cars or whatever it is by the end of the year.
[03:08:41.145 --> 03:08:42.145]  They ordered too many.
[03:08:43.526 --> 03:08:43.946]  And so,
[03:08:46.178 --> 03:08:48.559]  They're giving them to us at their cost.
[03:08:48.699 --> 03:08:49.499]  That's basically $90.
[03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:51.020]  $90-something dollars.
[03:08:51.580 --> 03:08:54.962]  And then we're just tagging on $20-something bucks so that we can fund our operation.
[03:08:56.682 --> 03:09:00.404]  You cannot, no one has ever done anything like this for Gravity Fed Filters.
[03:09:00.744 --> 03:09:03.205]  The other companies out there, I can tell you, are absolute crap.
[03:09:03.605 --> 03:09:03.885]  Okay?
[03:09:05.226 --> 03:09:05.666]  They're crap.
[03:09:05.746 --> 03:09:07.487]  That's why, I mean, I could have them all for sponsors.
[03:09:07.547 --> 03:09:07.987]  I could, whatever.
[03:09:08.047 --> 03:09:08.527]  No, I won't do it.
[03:09:09.888 --> 03:09:14.009]  Alexa Pure Breeze, and we're going to pull them, is, put it back on screen, $100.
[03:09:17.334 --> 03:09:20.157]  $127 right now.
[03:09:20.498 --> 03:09:22.880]  You are insane if you don't get this.
[03:09:23.380 --> 03:09:26.063]  And you should buy it for your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[03:09:26.163 --> 03:09:27.344]  This is a great Christmas gift.
[03:09:27.785 --> 03:09:32.249]  Explain the hundreds of chemicals in the average runoff water or tap water or well water.
[03:09:32.730 --> 03:09:35.473]  The glyphosate, all of it, the bisphenol A, it's all in there.
[03:09:35.973 --> 03:09:39.637]  The atrazine, the gender benders, it's all there.
[03:09:40.831 --> 03:09:41.471]  You can get it for $127.
[03:09:41.732 --> 03:09:43.733]  The filters, everything.
[03:09:43.753 --> 03:09:44.894]  We also sell the replaced filters.
[03:09:45.174 --> 03:09:46.415]  You cannot beat this deal.
[03:09:46.875 --> 03:09:48.816]  That is at cost.
[03:09:49.196 --> 03:09:52.058]  They're selling it to us at cost for like $96 or something.
[03:09:52.579 --> 03:09:54.560]  And then we're making $30 on it.
[03:09:55.741 --> 03:09:56.321]  That's insane.
[03:09:57.041 --> 03:09:58.122]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:09:58.442 --> 03:09:59.323]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:09:59.763 --> 03:10:03.686]  And they've got a couple thousand extra that they think that they can sell at this price.
[03:10:04.750 --> 03:10:08.451]  Once they think that they've sold enough, then they can go back to regular price at the end of the year, or they will.
[03:10:08.591 --> 03:10:12.092]  So, we've been authorized to sell 2,000 of these at this price.
[03:10:12.652 --> 03:10:14.073]  I suggest you take advantage of it.
[03:10:15.113 --> 03:10:20.754]  I personally am buying a bunch of them for friends and family, because I get them for like $96, the actual cost.
[03:10:20.774 --> 03:10:22.975]  But still, this is insane.
[03:10:23.315 --> 03:10:27.136]  Infowarestore.com, Alexa Pure Pro, their biggest, best.
[03:10:27.476 --> 03:10:33.158]  They do competitors $350, $400, then they discount them to $300, and these other companies are putting $50 into them.
[03:10:34.557 --> 03:10:36.119]  No, these are amazing systems.
[03:10:36.139 --> 03:10:36.680]  These are the best.
[03:10:36.780 --> 03:10:39.184]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:10:39.224 --> 03:10:41.568]  A bunch of the big specials are about to end as well.
[03:10:41.868 --> 03:10:44.051]  Paul, thanks for all your great work, my friend.
[03:10:44.132 --> 03:10:46.115]  It's been a busy week for everybody.
[03:10:46.135 --> 03:10:50.161]  I know you've always got the most important intel to cover, so Paul Watson, take it away.
[03:10:51.866 --> 03:10:52.406]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:10:52.446 --> 03:11:03.312]  Yeah, again, we're delving back into delusion and reality in the aftermath of this Jim Acosta controversy where they said he never touched her, even though all the videos clearly show that he did touch her.
[03:11:03.732 --> 03:11:10.295]  We also had this big story a few days ago, which kind of got glossed over when it happened, where PayPal
[03:11:11.232 --> 03:11:16.817]  Had to ban both Antifa and the Proud Boys after this situation outside Tucker Carlson's home.
[03:11:17.377 --> 03:11:23.622]  Because again, they tried to eschew blame from Antifa by claiming that it wasn't a single organization.
[03:11:23.662 --> 03:11:25.183]  Of course, it is an organization.
[03:11:25.223 --> 03:11:27.245]  You have several different chapters of Antifa.
[03:11:27.725 --> 03:11:32.809]  In many cases, they wear the same clothes, the same uniforms within these individual chapters.
[03:11:33.390 --> 03:11:38.534]  So PayPal banned a bunch of Antifa groups alongside a bunch of Proud Boy chapters.
[03:11:39.134 --> 03:11:39.655]  And then we had
[03:11:40.609 --> 03:11:53.178]  Think Progress come out with this narrative, which has been replicated by several other left-wing publications, that Antifa has never engaged in violence, that Antifa literally never attacks anyone.
[03:11:53.618 --> 03:11:57.921]  This is the article from Think Progress, which again is another George Soros front group.
[03:11:58.341 --> 03:12:03.565]  PayPal draws controversy for banning Antifa alongside far-right Proud Boys.
[03:12:04.205 --> 03:12:19.118]  So again, even though we warned all along that this censorious climate where people get de-platformed, where people lose their PayPal accounts, where they lose their bank accounts, is eventually going to have to affect both sides, they're still defending the far-left fringe extremists.
[03:12:19.198 --> 03:12:21.280]  It's the distinction I make over and over again.
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:25.764]  On the right, when there are far-right violent extremists, we distance ourselves from them.
[03:12:26.004 --> 03:12:27.605]  We don't want to be associated with them.
[03:12:27.846 --> 03:12:28.626]  The left doesn't.
[03:12:29.447 --> 03:12:31.729]  They make excuses for them time and time again.
[03:12:32.250 --> 03:12:35.452]  This is a quote out of the Think Progress article which is up right now.
[03:12:35.472 --> 03:12:36.773]  That is complete bonk.
[03:12:36.813 --> 03:12:37.734]  That is a complete lie.
[03:12:37.754 --> 03:12:39.655]  The very reason Proud Boys got banned from PayPal
[03:12:53.980 --> 03:13:03.765]  Sprang from that incident in New York after the event at the Metropolitan Republican Club, where Antifa and Proud Boys became engaged in a brawl in a fight.
[03:13:04.405 --> 03:13:09.368]  Now, Proud Boys finished that, they basically beat them up and won the fight, but who started it?
[03:13:10.365 --> 03:13:15.308]  Well, according to news reports, according to the NYPD, Antifa started the fight.
[03:13:15.609 --> 03:13:18.851]  They physically confronted Proud Boys members.
[03:13:19.251 --> 03:13:22.573]  They threw a bottle at them as they were coming out of that event.
[03:13:22.973 --> 03:13:29.638]  So the very violent confrontation that was used as an excuse to ban the Proud Boys was started by Antifa.
[03:13:29.978 --> 03:13:40.105]  And yet you've got these left-wing groups out claiming that not only did Antifa, they completely blameless in that incident, that they've never engaged in any violent confrontations.
[03:13:40.906 --> 03:13:42.427]  Literally you can go back to August.
[03:13:42.467 --> 03:13:44.048]  Here's a headline out of the Oregonian.
[03:13:45.049 --> 03:13:47.991]  He brought an American flag to protest fascism in Portland.
[03:13:48.472 --> 03:13:50.473]  Then Antifa attacked him.
[03:13:51.374 --> 03:13:53.556]  So they even attack their own people.
[03:13:53.856 --> 03:13:55.798]  This was a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[03:13:56.158 --> 03:13:57.399]  This was the August event.
[03:13:58.092 --> 03:14:01.394]  Uh, where Antifa and Proud Boys and these other right-wing groups clashed.
[03:14:01.654 --> 03:14:09.557]  They ended up smacking him over the head with a pole, beating him to the ground because he had an Antifa, uh, sorry, a US flag.
[03:14:09.737 --> 03:14:10.918]  You can't have a US flag.
[03:14:10.938 --> 03:14:11.798]  That's very triggering.
[03:14:11.818 --> 03:14:13.559]  They will beat the crap out of you.
[03:14:14.019 --> 03:14:18.021]  Oh, but no, they don't engage in any violence whatsoever, according to ThinkProgress.
[03:14:18.621 --> 03:14:19.262]  You can go back to 2017.
[03:14:21.039 --> 03:14:35.289]  Of course, we had the incident at UC Berkeley during the Milo speech, before and after, where they literally burned down the campus, threw rocks at police officers, injuring many of them, and pepper-sprayed women in the face.
[03:14:35.389 --> 03:14:37.110]  We all remember the horrific footage.
[03:14:37.130 --> 03:14:42.173]  But again, according to ThinkProgress, according to the left-wing media, none of this ever happened.
[03:14:42.473 --> 03:14:45.035]  Antifa's never violently attacked anyone.
[03:14:45.495 --> 03:14:50.659]  All the footage you see of them kicking people on the floor, beating people over the heads with clubs,
[03:14:51.660 --> 03:14:58.346]  The professor, the Antifa professor, smacking someone over the head with a bike lock, which he basically got away with.
[03:14:58.386 --> 03:14:59.547]  They tried to take him to court.
[03:14:59.567 --> 03:15:00.228]  He got away with it.
[03:15:00.568 --> 03:15:03.631]  None of that ever happened, according to the leftist media.
[03:15:04.091 --> 03:15:09.976]  Only right-wing organizations or groups ever engage in any kind of violence or any kind of civil unrest.
[03:15:10.417 --> 03:15:11.518]  So again, it goes back to this.
[03:15:12.409 --> 03:15:20.311]  Delusion versus reality bubble that we've got right now in American politics, where Jim Acosta clearly touches a White House intern.
[03:15:20.671 --> 03:15:21.491]  It's on tape.
[03:15:21.911 --> 03:15:23.051]  It's on all the tapes.
[03:15:23.411 --> 03:15:28.712]  It's on the doctored tape, which isn't even doctored, as I've explained a million times until I'm blue in the face.
[03:15:29.132 --> 03:15:31.173]  It's also on the original CNN tape.
[03:15:31.493 --> 03:15:33.393]  It's also on the original C-SPAN tape.
[03:15:33.693 --> 03:15:36.934]  Yet they've literally filed a lawsuit claiming that he never touched her.
[03:15:37.414 --> 03:15:42.095]  Hundreds of mainstream media publications have filed reports claiming he never touched her.
[03:15:42.771 --> 03:15:46.453]  Don't believe your lying guys, even though it's right there on the tape.
[03:15:46.513 --> 03:15:54.098]  Now they're doing the same thing to excuse Antifa of the clear pattern of violence they've engaged in for the past two-plus years.
[03:15:54.438 --> 03:15:56.699]  We'll be back to cover this and more on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:15:57.160 --> 03:15:58.840]  RankingNewsAtInfoWars.com.
[03:15:58.881 --> 03:15:59.321]  We'll be back.
[03:16:02.449 --> 03:16:12.881]  As many of you know, we have just offered in the last few months the biggest sales in InfoWars history because the globalists have been trying to literally take our credit card processing away.
[03:16:12.901 --> 03:16:15.124]  They've been trying to hack our sites and bring them down.
[03:16:15.524 --> 03:16:17.446]  They have not been successful.
[03:16:18.067 --> 03:16:23.610]  Now, a lot of times, other companies claim they have the best deals of the year on Black Friday they have for Thanksgiving.
[03:16:24.050 --> 03:16:25.951]  And it's been in the news that a lot of those are scams.
[03:16:26.251 --> 03:16:34.075]  You know, have things in a limited amount to lure you in and have the retail jacked up above what it's supposed to be and then lower it down.
[03:16:34.335 --> 03:16:35.416]  There's a lot of scams going on.
[03:16:36.016 --> 03:16:38.937]  Zero of that is going on at Infoworkstore.com.
[03:16:39.518 --> 03:16:40.598]  And you're getting great deals.
[03:16:41.278 --> 03:16:43.800]  And we've got everything in stock right now, almost everything.
[03:16:44.620 --> 03:16:46.883]  And obviously you're funding the information war against the globalists.
[03:16:47.183 --> 03:16:48.304]  So it's a 360 win.
[03:16:48.665 --> 03:16:50.767]  Don't fight the traffic for Christmas shopping.
[03:16:51.428 --> 03:16:58.475]  Know you're supporting an organization and group that is absolutely driving the globalists crazy and raising the alarm worldwide.
[03:16:58.876 --> 03:17:02.219]  It is a 360 win on this Black Friday.
[03:17:02.259 --> 03:17:03.781]  But the sale isn't just this Black Friday.
[03:17:04.321 --> 03:17:06.204]  Monday through next Sunday,
[03:17:06.804 --> 03:17:11.467]  We are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[03:17:11.968 --> 03:17:14.509]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, free shipping storewide.
[03:17:15.050 --> 03:17:15.770]  Let me read this to you.
[03:17:16.831 --> 03:17:20.714]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:17:22.115 --> 03:17:23.376]  In fact, this is even...
[03:17:25.336 --> 03:17:37.619]  Okay, this is the best sale ever, because we're doing the sale from a while back that was the best ever, with the free shipping 50% off storewide, and double Patriot points, which normal Patriot point is 5%, and so now this is 10%.
[03:17:38.699 --> 03:17:41.380]  So this makes a bunch of these complete lost leaders, this is insane.
[03:17:41.980 --> 03:17:47.021]  Okay, so let me be clear here, and just put this out like this, it's so much to say, we'll just put it out.
[03:17:47.361 --> 03:17:48.302]  No teleprompters here.
[03:17:48.722 --> 03:17:49.402]  Black Friday,
[03:17:50.603 --> 03:17:55.368]  InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:17:56.389 --> 03:18:02.537]  All InfoWars life supplements, 50% off with the free shipping and the double Patriot points.
[03:18:03.338 --> 03:18:08.124]  Up to 50% off on storable food, super high quality, that is huge.
[03:18:08.744 --> 03:18:11.227]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[03:18:11.627 --> 03:18:13.049]  Oh, this is the one that is the best ever.
[03:18:13.069 --> 03:18:18.995]  I can say on Black Friday, we've been running this sale a few weeks, this is the best we've ever done.
[03:18:19.015 --> 03:18:22.659]  $127, or 49% off, Alexa Pure Pro Gravity Fed Filters.
[03:18:23.360 --> 03:18:24.722]  One of the best systems out there.
[03:18:25.062 --> 03:18:25.743]  Leading competitors $300, $400.
[03:18:25.803 --> 03:18:26.403]  They usually retail at $240.
[03:18:30.067 --> 03:18:31.088]  Six, that's a great deal.
[03:18:31.528 --> 03:18:40.832]  We now have it at $127 because they ordered too many and want to, again, sell them out before the new year so they don't have to pay inventory tax to the feds and the state.
[03:18:41.732 --> 03:18:45.314]  Alexa Pure Breeze, air filtration, now at 40% off.
[03:18:45.374 --> 03:18:47.715]  That's right at Lost Leader, again, to get rid of inventory.
[03:18:47.915 --> 03:18:48.835]  So take advantage of that.
[03:18:48.875 --> 03:18:49.656]  It's an amazing system.
[03:18:50.476 --> 03:18:56.739]  Also, there's a bunch of special sections where we've got other deals at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:18:57.179 --> 03:18:58.280]  Too many to name.
[03:18:58.580 --> 03:19:04.644]  Up to 75% storewide, plus free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:19:05.625 --> 03:19:11.329]  Up to 75% off, storewide, plus free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:19:11.409 --> 03:19:16.413]  So, actually, now that I'm here, looking at this and thinking, this is the best deal we've ever done.
[03:19:17.113 --> 03:19:18.534]  So it actually tops the last deal.
[03:19:19.095 --> 03:19:19.495]  And you know what?
[03:19:19.515 --> 03:19:23.458]  Just put this out like it is, because it just shows how we're being transparent here.
[03:19:23.498 --> 03:19:26.220]  And this is so insane that they're trying to shut down our
[03:19:26.860 --> 03:19:27.861]  Credit card processors.
[03:19:28.201 --> 03:19:29.562]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[03:19:29.582 --> 03:19:30.383]  They're trying to defund us.
[03:19:30.663 --> 03:19:33.445]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[03:19:33.625 --> 03:19:40.171]  All of our inventory, I intend to have gone so that we're at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[03:19:40.691 --> 03:19:45.555]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:45.795 --> 03:19:46.776]  Support the InfoWars.
[03:19:46.796 --> 03:19:47.557]  Get great products.
[03:19:47.797 --> 03:19:49.298]  Get your Christmas shopping done early.
[03:19:49.318 --> 03:19:51.600]  And battle the globalists.
[03:19:51.820 --> 03:19:54.062]  A total 360 win at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:54.082 --> 03:19:55.343]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:20:05.091 --> 03:20:09.195]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:09.696 --> 03:20:11.037]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:20:14.701 --> 03:20:21.948]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:20:22.048 --> 03:20:24.050]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.331 --> 03:20:28.275]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:30.666 --> 03:20:44.746]  We're going to hit on a number of stories for the rest of this hour, including a big story that's just gone up on Infowars.com about a professor warning that Amazon Alexa and all these other home devices, including Google's device,
[03:20:45.439 --> 03:20:47.581]  Or recording your conversations in real time.
[03:20:47.641 --> 03:20:48.942]  It's not consensual.
[03:20:48.982 --> 03:20:51.044]  It's not when you just give them the cue.
[03:20:51.224 --> 03:20:52.425]  Alexa, what's the weather?
[03:20:52.485 --> 03:20:53.245]  Blah, blah, blah.
[03:20:53.505 --> 03:20:56.047]  They're recording your conversations in real time.
[03:20:56.088 --> 03:20:59.350]  Now we have a top professor warning people about that.
[03:20:59.710 --> 03:21:02.132]  It's got nowhere near the news attention it deserves.
[03:21:02.152 --> 03:21:04.214]  And I guess the overarching narrative
[03:21:05.126 --> 03:21:07.547]  For today's show is media hoaxes.
[03:21:07.907 --> 03:21:14.270]  We have the media hoax that Antifa didn't deserve to be banned, that Smash Racism didn't deserve to be banned.
[03:21:14.290 --> 03:21:30.198]  Who, by the way, Smash Racism, the group that organized that harassment campaign against Tucker Carlson, targeting his house where his wife and children literally had to hide in a pantry while calling the police because they were running up and banging on the door and vandalizing his property.
[03:21:31.542 --> 03:21:35.347]  They're now saying that basically that was nothing, they didn't even bang on the door.
[03:21:35.828 --> 03:21:44.880]  This smash racism group is still active on Instagram, on Facebook, they've been banned on Twitter, having doxxed numerous people in the past but they're still active on all these other platforms.
[03:21:45.481 --> 03:21:46.763]  So isn't it interesting that
[03:21:47.657 --> 03:21:56.964]  In the case of Infowars, they all coordinated to ban Infowars at basically the same time, within the same 12-hour time period, but not with these Antifa groups.
[03:21:56.984 --> 03:22:01.128]  They only get banned by sole platforms and eventually, in many cases, find their way back.
[03:22:01.608 --> 03:22:06.892]  But now you've got the media hoax narrative that Antifa have never engaged in violence.
[03:22:07.192 --> 03:22:08.153]  That's complete bunk.
[03:22:08.173 --> 03:22:09.875]  We've disproven that time and time again.
[03:22:10.979 --> 03:22:15.940]  You've got the whole Jim Acosta media hoax that he never touched the White House in turn, when he clearly did.
[03:22:16.461 --> 03:22:29.764]  And then on top of that, you've had a three-year media hoax about refugees and migrants coming into Europe that they are child refugees, when in the majority, the majority of cases, they're not.
[03:22:30.264 --> 03:22:32.385]  And now we have this, which is another big story again.
[03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:40.403]  Picked up by RT, picked up by a couple of right-wing media outlets, but getting nowhere near like the attention it deserves.
[03:22:40.443 --> 03:22:41.423]  This is out of RT.
[03:22:41.644 --> 03:22:46.906]  NGO exposed teaching migrants how to trick effing stupid EU border guards.
[03:22:47.526 --> 03:22:56.990]  This is secretly recorded footage from one of these top NGOs that's been helping these refugees, who aren't refugees, get into Greece, get into Europe,
[03:22:57.617 --> 03:23:07.621]  Via a process of complete and utter fraud and as a result of this expose they've actually had to basically delete their entire social media presence to save face.
[03:23:07.701 --> 03:23:10.402]  It remains to be seen whether they'll try and crawl back.
[03:23:10.962 --> 03:23:12.803]  The mainstream media is giving them cover.
[03:23:14.119 --> 03:23:17.101]  By not reporting on it, so they probably will try and crawl back eventually.
[03:23:17.622 --> 03:23:31.652]  The article states, a group that helped over 15,000 refugees and migrants to get into Europe has been caught on tape admitting to systematically training asylum seekers to exploit screening interviews by feigning trauma and persecution.
[03:23:32.612 --> 03:23:33.473]  Ariel Ricker.
[03:23:33.953 --> 03:23:35.955]  This is the woman caught on a secret recording.
[03:23:36.798 --> 03:23:49.048]  The Executive Director of Advocates Abroad, a major non-profit NGO which provides legal aid to migrants, has been caught on tape openly discussing how she teaches refugees to lie to border agents.
[03:23:50.369 --> 03:23:57.534]  Now again, they brag on their website, it remains to be seen whether they'll remove their website temporarily, that they've helped as many as 15,000 migrants.
[03:23:57.574 --> 03:24:02.058]  But in this footage, basically she admits that they teach them to act.
[03:24:02.805 --> 03:24:08.410]  They teach them to act like they're in trauma, like they're fleeing war, when they're not fleeing war.
[03:24:08.790 --> 03:24:12.913]  Telling them what to say to border guards to trick them into letting them in.
[03:24:13.193 --> 03:24:14.114]  To lie to them.
[03:24:15.415 --> 03:24:16.996]  Absolutely shocking footage.
[03:24:17.997 --> 03:24:20.119]  After this footage was released initially.
[03:24:20.905 --> 03:24:31.049]  Advocates Abroad put out a tweet stating, Advocates Abroad was made aware of a video that shows a heavily edited version of an informal conversation that was secretly filmed and without consent.
[03:24:31.409 --> 03:24:34.910]  So again, what do they run to every time they get caught?
[03:24:35.330 --> 03:24:36.671]  Oh, it was heavily edited.
[03:24:37.151 --> 03:24:37.271]  No.
[03:24:38.112 --> 03:24:45.156]  Cutting out segments of a video and putting the important bits out publicly is not doctoring, it's not heavily editing.
[03:24:45.536 --> 03:24:47.277]  All news organisations do it.
[03:24:47.557 --> 03:24:52.719]  You cannot run away from your fraud, from your criminality, by claiming a video was edited.
[03:24:53.120 --> 03:24:57.702]  This tweet went on to say, the video is being used for political right-wing effect.
[03:24:58.182 --> 03:25:04.905]  So they came out hours after this broke, claiming that it was all a hoax, that the video was doctored, that it was fake.
[03:25:05.046 --> 03:25:07.767]  It wasn't fake, just as in the Jim Acosta situation.
[03:25:08.490 --> 03:25:16.878]  And when all these other big groups think Oxford University was one, even the UN came out and had to distance themselves from this group, they deleted their Twitter page.
[03:25:17.239 --> 03:25:21.383]  They deleted their Facebook page with 140,000 followers.
[03:25:21.763 --> 03:25:30.091]  So again, they basically deplatformed themselves, perhaps in the hope that once this goes away, they can crawl back without anyone noticing.
[03:25:30.491 --> 03:25:32.934]  But their top individual is on tape saying,
[03:25:33.760 --> 03:25:40.843]  We train these people to fake trauma, to lie to border agents, to get in, and it's all being exposed.
[03:25:40.863 --> 03:25:42.843]  But again, hardly any media is picking up on it.
[03:25:43.164 --> 03:25:48.226]  Which reminds me of another related controversy, which actually happened in 2016.
[03:25:49.226 --> 03:25:50.446]  This is out of The Independent.
[03:25:51.027 --> 03:25:57.249]  Gary Lineker receives torrent of criticism after calling response to child refugees arrival, hideously racist.
[03:25:58.078 --> 03:26:06.001]  So basically, if you remember the story, a bunch of child refugees arrived in the UK from the jungle camp in Calais, France.
[03:26:06.761 --> 03:26:10.382]  They were obviously literally like 30 years old plus.
[03:26:10.783 --> 03:26:12.303]  They had full beards, some of them.
[03:26:12.603 --> 03:26:14.024]  Some of them were probably even over 40.
[03:26:15.123 --> 03:26:25.910]  When myself and others pointed out that these were obviously not child refugees, they were faking their ages to get into the country, we were demonised, we were called hideously racist.
[03:26:26.350 --> 03:26:29.312]  And then what came out almost two years later?
[03:26:29.712 --> 03:26:31.313]  This story out of the Daily Mail.
[03:26:32.534 --> 03:26:33.975]  Truth about child refugees.
[03:26:34.535 --> 03:26:44.061]  Two-thirds quizzed about their age are found to be adults, official report reveals, after almost 3,000 people claiming to be unaccompanied minors apply for asylum in a year.
[03:26:44.813 --> 03:26:52.918]  The article states, nearly two-thirds of child refugees who were questioned about their real age after coming to Britain were found to be adults.
[03:26:53.599 --> 03:26:54.800]  Two-thirds of them!
[03:26:55.400 --> 03:27:03.425]  And if you look at the pictures in that Daily Mail article, the first picture on the article, blatantly not a child, probably an adult nearing the age of 40.
[03:27:03.966 --> 03:27:07.008]  If you scroll down you'll see the first picture there, right there.
[03:27:07.348 --> 03:27:08.869]  That is not a child, okay?
[03:27:09.729 --> 03:27:12.551]  We were called racist for saying that was not a child in 2016,
[03:27:14.105 --> 03:27:16.568]  Less than two years later, the official report came out.
[03:27:16.969 --> 03:27:20.553]  Two-thirds of them were, imagine my shock, lying about their age.
[03:27:21.534 --> 03:27:22.496]  And what happened next?
[03:27:22.556 --> 03:27:25.199]  We had this report out of the BBC just last week.
[03:27:25.905 --> 03:27:30.007]  Ipswich School reports pupil aged 30 to home office.
[03:27:30.407 --> 03:27:33.228]  This was a secondary school, a high school of teenagers.
[03:27:33.488 --> 03:27:44.653]  There was a 30-year-old guy in the maths class basically joking to all the other kids about how he was an adult, how he lied and tricked his way into the country by claiming to be a child refugee.
[03:27:45.153 --> 03:27:49.715]  Again, at the time, the media reported all this completely above board that there was no deception going on.
[03:27:49.995 --> 03:27:52.076]  It was a gigantic media hoax.
[03:27:52.537 --> 03:27:53.537]  Same thing in Sweden.
[03:27:54.381 --> 03:27:59.863]  Again, BBC report of December 2017, Sweden child migrant tests reveal many adults.
[03:28:00.304 --> 03:28:12.789]  They had a forensic investigation, Sweden's National Forensic Medicine Agency, they found that the, I think it was 84% I believe from this article, actually 79% that they were not children.
[03:28:15.259 --> 03:28:16.321]  They were over the age of 18.
[03:28:17.203 --> 03:28:18.766]  They lied from the very beginning.
[03:28:19.087 --> 03:28:22.553]  Everyone who pointed that out at the very beginning was called a racist.
[03:28:22.954 --> 03:28:24.377]  You had the same thing in Denmark.
[03:28:25.234 --> 03:28:26.615]  An article out of the Express.
[03:28:26.635 --> 03:28:29.097]  So it's media hoax after media hoax after media hoax.
[03:28:29.137 --> 03:28:29.557]  We're right.
[03:28:29.577 --> 03:28:30.258]  We're called racist.
[03:28:30.278 --> 03:28:32.539]  We're demonized for telling the truth.
[03:28:47.390 --> 03:28:51.553]  And when it comes out, they just want the story to slowly vanish and go away.
[03:28:51.753 --> 03:28:57.457]  Absolutely incredible levels of deception at every level, and the media is complicit in that.
[03:28:57.477 --> 03:28:57.917]  We'll be back.
[03:28:57.977 --> 03:28:58.958]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:28:59.098 --> 03:28:59.658]  Don't go away.
[03:29:02.560 --> 03:29:09.625]  We have been in a continual state of war since we bought into the idea of a permanent standing army after World War II.
[03:29:10.615 --> 03:29:16.782]  We have a Saudi-led attack on Yemen on the port, escalating in just a 24-hour span.
[03:29:17.022 --> 03:29:20.526]  At least 150 people killed after weeks of deadly fighting.
[03:29:20.906 --> 03:29:22.968]  Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Yemen.
[03:29:23.288 --> 03:29:24.129]  Any reporting on that?
[03:29:24.470 --> 03:29:24.610]  No.
[03:29:24.630 --> 03:29:26.772]  They don't care about the lives of people.
[03:29:26.792 --> 03:29:28.734]  They don't care about the lives of these Yemenis.
[03:29:28.774 --> 03:29:31.938]  They don't care about the lives of their own soldiers.
[03:29:33.163 --> 03:29:37.265]  And they don't care about the principles that these soldiers thought they were fighting for either.
[03:29:37.925 --> 03:29:45.008]  The principles, just like the lives of the soldiers, are expendable in these manufactured wars for empire.
[03:29:45.568 --> 03:29:48.469]  Now we've got something that is much more dangerous that is coming up right now.
[03:29:49.329 --> 03:29:55.352]  We're coming up to a cycle in human history, a generational turning point.
[03:29:55.952 --> 03:29:58.773]  And again, you should read the book, Fourth Turning, if you haven't.
[03:29:59.956 --> 03:30:09.858]  Strauss and Howe went back 500 years in American and English-British history to see this recurring cycle about every 80 years, having a major restructuring of society.
[03:30:11.018 --> 03:30:14.159]  Frequently, these restructurings are accompanied by wars.
[03:30:15.119 --> 03:30:19.680]  Things like the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, those were all forthcoming.
[03:30:20.840 --> 03:30:26.161]  Now, as we talk about resurging old demons, that's what I see coming.
[03:30:27.102 --> 03:30:28.942]  I see history being recycled.
[03:30:30.536 --> 03:30:52.789]  And when you have these standing armies, when you have these politicians who have an empire mindset like Macron, who are trying to accrue and concentrate power to themselves, those are the elements that create things like World War I. Because it was the type of thing that the founders had always looked at Europe as having.
[03:30:53.049 --> 03:30:56.231]  These constant, eternal European wars.
[03:30:56.471 --> 03:30:57.692]  Not a remaking of society.
[03:30:58.831 --> 03:31:00.993]  Because, you know, people look at that and they say, that was a just war.
[03:31:01.393 --> 03:31:02.874]  That was a justifiable war.
[03:31:02.974 --> 03:31:03.154]  Whatever.
[03:31:03.175 --> 03:31:09.680]  They look at the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, they look at World War II and they say, yeah, that was a time when we were really fighting for something.
[03:31:09.740 --> 03:31:11.101]  World War I, they weren't fighting for anything.
[03:31:12.342 --> 03:31:14.764]  Patriotism was summed up by Smedley Butler.
[03:31:15.044 --> 03:31:18.627]  He said, talking about true patriotism, he said, we fight to protect our home.
[03:31:20.148 --> 03:31:20.969]  And our Constitution.
[03:31:22.634 --> 03:31:24.475]  No, we fight to defend our lives.
[03:31:24.535 --> 03:31:27.375]  To defend our lives.
[03:31:27.435 --> 03:31:29.896]  Not in foreign wars of empire.
[03:31:30.636 --> 03:31:32.797]  Not for regime change in the Middle East.
[03:31:33.317 --> 03:31:34.917]  We fight to defend our homes.
[03:31:34.978 --> 03:31:36.758]  Instead, everything else is a racket.
[03:31:37.198 --> 03:31:38.819]  It is organized crime.
[03:31:38.899 --> 03:31:39.739]  And he was exactly right.
[03:31:41.178 --> 03:31:42.659]  We fight to defend our Constitution.
[03:31:42.699 --> 03:31:44.140]  We're fighting to defend our values.
[03:31:44.940 --> 03:31:46.161]  That is what nationalism is about.
[03:31:46.261 --> 03:31:49.343]  Patriotism is about fighting to defend your homeland.
[03:31:50.183 --> 03:32:00.329]  Nationalism is about fighting to defend your political system and the values embodied in that political and legal system in our Constitution.
[03:32:00.409 --> 03:32:03.511]  And if we had stuck to those values, we would have never been drawn into World War I.
[03:32:05.037 --> 03:32:11.415]  Maybe Emmanuel Macron should read the writing of our former president, James Madison, father of the Bill of Rights.
[03:32:12.137 --> 03:32:12.999]  He said throughout Europe.
[03:32:13.948 --> 03:32:20.830]  The armies kept under the pretext of defending have enslaved the people.
[03:32:20.910 --> 03:32:26.712]  And quite frankly, that is the true purpose of Macron's EU army.
[03:32:28.013 --> 03:32:31.234]  He's not going to be putting that up there to protect them from foreign invasions.
[03:32:31.254 --> 03:32:33.114]  He's inviting the foreign invaders.
[03:32:34.114 --> 03:32:38.116]  The fifth column coming into the country.
[03:32:38.156 --> 03:32:39.096]  He's opened up the borders.
[03:32:39.136 --> 03:32:41.037]  He's part of the globalist open border cartel.
[03:32:43.343 --> 03:32:46.225]  He is not going to defend people.
[03:32:46.245 --> 03:32:50.907]  He's going to use the army to attack the people who object to that.
[03:32:51.047 --> 03:32:54.109]  To object to having their homes destroyed.
[03:32:54.229 --> 03:33:01.152]  Armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.
[03:33:04.354 --> 03:33:10.237]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.

[03:35:00.327 --> 03:35:02.529]  Very interesting report on CNN.com.
[03:35:02.569 --> 03:35:06.191]  Obviously, they made themselves the top story on their own website today.
[03:35:06.943 --> 03:35:09.525]  CNN has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.
[03:35:09.565 --> 03:35:10.966]  Now this is where it gets interesting.
[03:35:11.707 --> 03:35:18.993]  The statement they put out read, quote, it demands the return of White House credentials of CNN's chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta.
[03:35:19.513 --> 03:35:28.000]  The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta's First Amendment rights of freedom of the press and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process.
[03:35:28.701 --> 03:35:35.382]  So now CNN's all butthurt and worried about people being revoked of their right of freedom of the press.
[03:35:35.962 --> 03:35:39.683]  Now, Jim Acosta is not banned from the White House, let's make that clear.
[03:35:39.923 --> 03:35:47.544]  He has to get permission before re-entering the White House, like every other reporter who doesn't have what they call this hard pass.
[03:35:47.884 --> 03:35:55.886]  His hard pass, where he gets to go in and out as he pleases, has been revoked as a result of his behaviour during that press conference last week.
[03:35:56.286 --> 03:35:57.206]  But this is the irony.
[03:35:58.075 --> 03:36:01.778]  They're complaining about the rights of freedom of press being removed.
[03:36:02.138 --> 03:36:15.389]  This is the same organisation with Oliver Darcy and Brian Stelter and others that lobbied for a solid six months, six months to get a competing news network banned, yeeted,
[03:36:16.101 --> 03:36:20.744]  Removed, de-platformed, de-personed from all social media.
[03:36:20.784 --> 03:36:31.252]  They literally put reporters on special assignments to lobby corporations to ban Alex Jones, to ban Infowars, in the end with obviously widespread success.
[03:36:31.692 --> 03:36:42.560]  So now they're all worried about freedom of the press, having spent much of the past year campaigning, lobbying, abusing their platform to ban other press outlets.
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:43.721]  Isn't that ironic?
[03:36:44.641 --> 03:36:45.542]  Now this is the article
[03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:49.843]  CNN sues President Trump and White House for banning report to Jim Acosta.
[03:36:50.444 --> 03:36:51.525]  And again, it goes into it.
[03:36:51.665 --> 03:36:57.911]  The lawsuit, which I've actually read, mentions the so-called doctored videotape, which was never doctored.
[03:36:58.451 --> 03:37:05.958]  And the lawsuit is linked from a Breitbart article called Full Document, CNN's lawsuit to restore Jim Acosta's White House credentials.
[03:37:06.716 --> 03:37:27.803]  And in that lawsuit, which you can read on Scribe, they've posted it, they literally claim, they're now claiming, having initially said in Washington Post and a hundred other media outlets, big media outlets, claiming that this video was definitely doctored and that this video was used to remove Acosta's press access, they're now saying it was apparently doctored.
[03:37:28.423 --> 03:37:32.004]  So those are the words used in the exact lawsuit, apparently doctored.
[03:37:32.603 --> 03:37:33.884]  They mention Infowars.
[03:37:34.164 --> 03:37:36.885]  They mention that they basically say they got it from me.
[03:37:37.725 --> 03:37:45.029]  But again, trying to create, trying to continue this giant media hoax that Jim Acosta did not touch a woman.
[03:37:45.409 --> 03:37:48.530]  In fact, they actually quote Reuters journalists.
[03:37:48.570 --> 03:37:53.693]  They quote other journalists who say they were right there when it happened and they did not see
[03:37:54.781 --> 03:37:58.130]  Jim Acosta, place his hands on the intern.
[03:37:58.170 --> 03:38:01.218]  Those are the exact words they use, place his hands on the intern.
[03:38:01.599 --> 03:38:03.905]  They quote Chuck Ross of the Daily Caller.
[03:38:04.659 --> 03:38:10.926]  Who is wrong, and who wrote that there is, quote, plenty to criticise Acosta about, but he did not place his hands on the intern.
[03:38:11.186 --> 03:38:13.408]  It's ridiculous for anyone to suggest he did.
[03:38:14.029 --> 03:38:22.558]  Okay, now let's roll the video, you've obviously got it in the system right there, of that very incident where he clearly places his hands on the White House intern.
[03:38:22.958 --> 03:38:26.262]  They also quote another journalist, Jeff Mason of Reuters,
[03:38:27.705 --> 03:38:33.549]  Here we see the video again, the original video from C-SPAN, not the quote, doctored version, which isn't doctored at all.
[03:38:33.849 --> 03:38:36.371]  Does he place his hands on a White House intern?
[03:38:36.611 --> 03:38:39.052]  Does he use his left hand to push down on hers?
[03:38:39.353 --> 03:38:41.514]  Yes he does, it's right there in the video.
[03:38:41.774 --> 03:38:46.637]  Yet they're still claiming, as part of this international media hoax, that it never happened.
[03:38:47.298 --> 03:38:53.762]  They quote Geoff Mason of Reuters, a former president of WHCA, who was seated next to Acosta at the press conference,
[03:38:54.680 --> 03:38:59.443]  And quote, did not witness him placing his hands on the young intern as the White House alleges.
[03:38:59.943 --> 03:39:02.405]  He held on to the microphone as she reached for it.
[03:39:02.965 --> 03:39:10.390]  Yes, he held on to the microphone with his right hand and using his left hand placed his hand on the White House intern.
[03:39:10.650 --> 03:39:12.131]  You can see it in the CNN video.
[03:39:12.371 --> 03:39:13.892]  You can see it in the C-SPAN video.
[03:39:14.132 --> 03:39:20.756]  You don't even need to look at the video that I put out, which wasn't doctored, to see that that's a blatant reality.
[03:39:21.300 --> 03:39:23.584]  They also talk about the audio being removed.
[03:39:23.624 --> 03:39:33.422]  Now, this is something that Jimmy Kimmel mentioned, I think it was three times during his monologue last weekend, last week on, I think it was Wednesday night or Thursday night.
[03:39:33.923 --> 03:39:34.604]  Again, claiming
[03:39:35.518 --> 03:39:43.362]  That the video was doctored or edited because the audio from the moment where Acosta said, I'm sorry, ma'am, had been removed.
[03:39:43.442 --> 03:39:46.703]  Well, no, again, that's another complete misleading deception.
[03:39:47.063 --> 03:39:55.207]  The audio from the entire clip had been removed because the original file was a GIF image and it was not a video file.
[03:39:55.487 --> 03:39:58.669]  GIF images do not have audio contained.
[03:39:58.949 --> 03:39:59.769]  That's basic.
[03:40:00.529 --> 03:40:01.310]  Anyone knows that.
[03:40:01.470 --> 03:40:03.811]  Anyone who's ever used the Internet knows that.
[03:40:04.801 --> 03:40:10.422]  So this lawsuit says, in the original video, Acosta's arm appears to move only as a response to a tussle for the microphone.
[03:40:10.802 --> 03:40:11.242]  Oh, wait a minute.
[03:40:11.282 --> 03:40:13.363]  You just said before he didn't place his hands on her.
[03:40:13.943 --> 03:40:16.103]  Now you're saying it was a tussle for the microphone.
[03:40:16.383 --> 03:40:17.404]  What is a tussle?
[03:40:18.004 --> 03:40:20.464]  Okay, a tussle is a physical coming together, right?
[03:40:21.084 --> 03:40:24.685]  So this lawsuit contradicts itself in the very next paragraph.
[03:40:25.485 --> 03:40:27.966]  It continues his statement, referring to Acosta.
[03:40:28.366 --> 03:40:32.687]  Pardon me, ma'am, is not included in the video Sanders shared.
[03:40:33.268 --> 03:40:41.972]  So again, they're attempting to claim that this was doctored, which if you look at the definition of doctored it means to falsify, which is again completely wrong.
[03:40:41.992 --> 03:40:51.817]  They're claiming that the audio was removed as part of this doctoring, as part of this deception, when the audio was removed from the entire clip, not just that moment.
[03:40:52.597 --> 03:40:58.000]  They then quote Councillor to the President Kellyanne Conway, who went on Fox News on Sunday
[03:40:58.991 --> 03:41:06.155]  And said, admitted as they say, that it had been sped up like they speed up replays in football.
[03:41:06.195 --> 03:41:07.776]  Now obviously she misspoke.
[03:41:08.216 --> 03:41:09.797]  She meant to say slow down.
[03:41:10.464 --> 03:41:14.426]  But they're not accounting for that fact where she clearly misspoke and meant to say slow down.
[03:41:14.446 --> 03:41:21.690]  But again, as I've proven with the screenshots from the editing software, nothing was slowed down, nothing was sped up.
[03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:25.032]  They can't seem to decide whether it was slowed down or sped up.
[03:41:25.412 --> 03:41:30.035]  Some people talk about frames being added, some people talk about frames being removed.
[03:41:30.315 --> 03:41:31.756]  They can't make up their own minds.
[03:41:32.416 --> 03:41:37.539]  There was two forensic analysts who vice quoted in one of their articles, again,
[03:41:38.496 --> 03:41:49.242]  After having initially said that the video was doctored, Motherboard, which is also a division of Vice, came out in an article and admitted forensic experts say the video was not doctored.
[03:41:49.982 --> 03:41:52.224]  So they can't decide whether it's sped up or slowed down.
[03:41:52.484 --> 03:41:59.107]  They're talking about audio being removed when there was no audio in the video to begin with because it was a GIF image which doesn't contain audio.
[03:41:59.528 --> 03:42:03.870]  So now in this lawsuit they're saying that it was, quote, apparently doctored.
[03:42:04.853 --> 03:42:09.677]  So they're not even now solid on whether it was doctored or not, or apparently altered, as they say.
[03:42:10.057 --> 03:42:11.778]  It wasn't altered in a way to deceive.
[03:42:11.838 --> 03:42:13.880]  The only alteration was zooming in.
[03:42:14.240 --> 03:42:17.622]  And as Trump said, that's not doctoring.
[03:42:17.682 --> 03:42:21.005]  I did an entire eight-minute video about it, which you can see on YouTube.
[03:42:22.336 --> 03:42:24.697]  Acosta doesn't have any divine right to be in the White House.
[03:42:25.018 --> 03:42:27.079]  He can still ask for permission to be in the White House.
[03:42:27.479 --> 03:42:33.883]  As Alex Jones said in a previous segment, we had White House access at least to the press room for a brief amount of time.
[03:42:34.283 --> 03:42:39.666]  CNN was one of the mainstream media organizations lobbying to have that press access revoked.
[03:42:40.206 --> 03:42:42.568]  So again, it's do as we say, not as we do.
[03:42:42.848 --> 03:42:49.213]  They lobbied for six months to have Infowars removed, to have our rights to press freedom yanked, taken away.
[03:42:49.733 --> 03:42:54.877]  Then Acosta's gets his removed for justifiable reasons, and it's a massive scandal.
[03:42:54.937 --> 03:42:57.279]  Now, stop lying to your audience, stop deceiving.
[03:42:58.019 --> 03:42:58.920]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:42:58.960 --> 03:42:59.701]  We'll be back live.
[03:42:59.961 --> 03:43:00.481]  Don't go away.
[03:43:02.643 --> 03:43:06.186]  You know why I love President Trump so much?
[03:43:07.446 --> 03:43:09.409]  It's because I know he's for real.
[03:43:09.989 --> 03:43:11.091]  He's trying the best he can.
[03:43:11.111 --> 03:43:15.316]  He's gotten so much done despite the enemies arrayed against him.
[03:43:16.097 --> 03:43:21.043]  And I've been really persecuted at a level we've never experienced before.
[03:43:23.011 --> 03:43:24.573]  50 times the level I've ever experienced.
[03:43:25.314 --> 03:43:28.037]  The demonization, the lies, the harassment, the fake lawsuits.
[03:43:28.878 --> 03:43:29.820]  Because I've supported Trump.
[03:43:30.861 --> 03:43:31.462]  Now why is that?
[03:43:31.702 --> 03:43:37.889]  It's because Trump supports the idea of the nation-state, a pro-human future, not a globalist technocracy.
[03:43:38.650 --> 03:43:39.891]  And he really does love this country.
[03:43:40.392 --> 03:43:50.680]  And nation-states stand in the way of mega-corporations allied with authoritarian regimes like China and the EU, dominating and oppressing and controlling populations.
[03:43:51.241 --> 03:43:55.084]  These people lust after controlling and running our lives.
[03:43:55.164 --> 03:43:56.385]  They want power.
[03:43:56.986 --> 03:44:04.452]  I just wanted to state here, with this being the week of Thanksgiving, that I am extremely thankful for President Trump, and I stand with President Trump.
[03:44:05.413 --> 03:44:08.796]  And I'm also extremely thankful to all of you out there.
[03:44:09.537 --> 03:44:12.800]  And I'm appreciative of you, and I love you, and I want to thank you.
[03:44:13.481 --> 03:44:22.310]  And I'm very, very humble for the support and the prayers for all of you that have stood with them full wars over the years and put up with my annex sometimes when I get off the rails.
[03:44:22.330 --> 03:44:23.030]  None of us are perfect.
[03:44:23.531 --> 03:44:28.576]  And I just want you to know that we are all unified in our love of God, our love of justice,
[03:44:29.136 --> 03:44:40.101]  Our love of freedom, our love of the rule of law, our love of sovereignty, and this great experience of human life we're all experiencing together, and the long saga, the long march of humanity towards freedom.
[03:44:41.101 --> 03:44:46.584]  And the last 244 years of the American experience, what our ancestors have gone through together.
[03:44:46.604 --> 03:44:49.165]  America's destiny is very, very special.
[03:44:50.185 --> 03:44:51.686]  So no matter where you are in the world, or
[03:44:52.806 --> 03:44:54.647]  What color you are or even what your religion is.
[03:44:55.267 --> 03:45:01.051]  If you have a sense of justice and a sense of wanting to stand up for the innocent and wanting to build a better world.
[03:45:01.851 --> 03:45:10.115]  And you understand that evil people come in and manipulate that goodness in our heart so that we give up our will, our free will to them.
[03:45:10.716 --> 03:45:15.278]  So these vampires can direct us when they don't have consciences, but they know we have consciences.
[03:45:15.618 --> 03:45:16.359]  So it's a very
[03:45:18.308 --> 03:45:29.015]  Delicate balance between being loving and being open and wanting to help people and being deceived and manipulated by bad people to end up doing evil things.
[03:45:29.856 --> 03:45:39.122]  But with Trump and with the American people and what you see with nationalism and patriotism and Christianity reawakening around the world, it's a very, very, very special time.
[03:45:39.982 --> 03:45:40.863]  And this is real.
[03:45:41.183 --> 03:45:42.524]  And we're all in this together.
[03:45:42.844 --> 03:45:44.866]  And Trump is fighting to deliver
[03:45:45.906 --> 03:45:47.027]  And to not betray.
[03:45:47.347 --> 03:45:49.968]  But he's not perfect and he can't act alone.
[03:45:50.308 --> 03:45:51.769]  He can't do this on his own.
[03:45:52.249 --> 03:45:54.470]  And so we shouldn't be two-faced, any of us.
[03:45:55.370 --> 03:45:57.831]  When we're friends and family and neighbors.
[03:45:58.291 --> 03:46:01.633]  And virtue signal when they attack Trump and throw him under the bus.
[03:46:02.193 --> 03:46:12.295]  We have to stand up for Trump when that happens because he is a microcosm or an archetype or a figurehead of the spirit of resistance and who we are.
[03:46:12.975 --> 03:46:20.016]  And when we don't sit there and deny the fact that we respect and love him, it gives the enemy power.
[03:46:20.036 --> 03:46:24.817]  So we have to stand and be strong in the face of these bullies and say we're not backing down.
[03:46:25.037 --> 03:46:26.458]  And you have supported InfoWars.
[03:46:26.978 --> 03:46:27.918]  You've made it all possible.
[03:46:28.658 --> 03:46:31.300]  And so I want to thank all of you out there for what you've done.
[03:46:31.320 --> 03:46:33.401]  And I want to remind some of those out there that get depressed.
[03:46:33.461 --> 03:46:34.342]  I know I do sometimes.
[03:46:34.822 --> 03:46:35.943]  This is a long journey.
[03:46:36.764 --> 03:46:40.586]  And good ruling this planet is not going to be easy.
[03:46:40.907 --> 03:46:43.929]  That's why it's the Animated Contest of Liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[03:46:43.989 --> 03:46:45.530]  But we've done incredible things.
[03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:46.931]  We've come from way behind.
[03:46:47.271 --> 03:46:49.112]  Now the enemy's launching their counter-assault.
[03:46:50.273 --> 03:46:51.814]  And we're living in history right now.
[03:46:52.315 --> 03:46:52.975]  God bless you all.
[03:46:53.015 --> 03:46:54.076]  Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.
[03:46:54.516 --> 03:46:56.477]  And again, thank you all for your support of InfoWars.
[03:47:04.167 --> 03:47:08.289]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:08.809 --> 03:47:10.150]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:14.711 --> 03:47:21.494]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.734 --> 03:47:25.416]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:28.044 --> 03:47:38.350]  MEP Nigel Farage has called out Angela Merkel, called on her to apologise for basically ruining German communities as a result of her disastrous open borders policy.
[03:47:38.370 --> 03:47:39.871]  We're going to go to that clip here in a second.
[03:47:40.671 --> 03:47:45.934]  This of course comes off the back of President Macron of France with his pathetic and plummeting 26% approval rating.
[03:47:48.539 --> 03:47:53.722]  Remember, this is the new so-called leader of Europe as Angela Merkel's political legacy crashes and burns.
[03:47:54.443 --> 03:48:11.634]  He, with his 26% approval rating, is now lecturing Donald Trump about how things should be run, about how evil nationalism is, while his own former Interior Minister basically says that within five years in France there's going to be mass civil unrest, dislocation of society.
[03:48:12.543 --> 03:48:17.285]  You know, perhaps he should concentrate on problems within his own country before getting up and lecturing Donald Trump.
[03:48:17.605 --> 03:48:24.749]  We've got the French Finance Minister basically saying that Europe now needs to become an empire to challenge the United States.
[03:48:25.169 --> 03:48:32.172]  We've got Angela Merkel and others pursuing and actually formalising now an EU army, which they promised they would never do.
[03:48:32.733 --> 03:48:41.177]  So now Farage got up in front of the EU Parliament and directly challenged, as she sat there just a few feet away from him, Angela Merkel.
[03:48:41.217 --> 03:48:41.757]  Here's the clip.
[03:48:44.217 --> 03:48:50.961]  Many of my Eurosceptic colleagues have been booing you this morning but they shouldn't be in a way because the British should be cheering you.
[03:48:51.021 --> 03:48:56.044]  Without you we'd never have made it over the line with Brexit and I want to thank you very much for that.
[03:48:56.704 --> 03:49:08.531]  And of course many of these Eurosceptic groups on the right, the centre and the left will come back here after the next European elections in huge numbers directly as a result of your immigration and asylum policy.
[03:49:09.091 --> 03:49:10.092]  Your we can cope
[03:49:10.732 --> 03:49:16.815]  led to a huge migrant tide, indeed a stampede, that came across the Mediterranean.
[03:49:17.476 --> 03:49:21.578]  Young men coming from very different cultures who were not going to integrate.
[03:49:22.118 --> 03:49:27.281]  Young men, none of whom would have qualified as being genuine refugees, and I think in many ways,
[03:49:28.121 --> 03:49:39.511]  We looked at it in the referendum and we said we don't want to be part of an increasingly German-dominated European Union and we certainly don't want to pay the price for Mrs Merkel's errors.
[03:49:39.932 --> 03:49:50.521]  And I believe, having heard you today and listening to senior French politicians over the last couple of days, that for us leaving the European Union is now indeed a liberation.
[03:49:51.021 --> 03:49:54.564]  It's a European Union that we're told is now to become an empire.
[03:49:55.285 --> 03:49:57.426]  A militarized European Union.
[03:49:57.766 --> 03:49:59.927]  An undemocratic European Union.
[03:50:00.348 --> 03:50:05.550]  A European Union that seeks to continually expand to the East.
[03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:11.813]  A European Union that has launched a new Cold War against the United States of America.
[03:50:12.454 --> 03:50:16.816]  A European Union that tries to rewrite history.
[03:50:16.836 --> 03:50:18.957]  And I think a hundred years on from the armistice,
[03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:22.052]  We should be genuinely worried.
[03:50:22.712 --> 03:50:33.122]  The idea that this new militarized union is somehow a recipe for peace, I suggest you all sit back and think a little bit more carefully.
[03:50:33.662 --> 03:50:36.185]  Maybe you should all re-read history.
[03:50:36.225 --> 03:50:40.308]  The European project was set up to stop German domination.
[03:50:40.709 --> 03:50:43.952]  What you've seen today is a naked takeover bid.
[03:50:45.700 --> 03:50:48.723]  So I think Brexit becomes a necessity after this.
[03:50:49.364 --> 03:50:53.108]  And for the rest of the countries, Mrs Merkel, you've had a long, successful career.
[03:50:53.789 --> 03:51:01.537]  But your political decision to open up the doors unconditionally is the worst decision we've seen in post-war politics in Europe.
[03:51:02.017 --> 03:51:04.080]  Is it not time for you at last
[03:51:04.540 --> 03:51:17.973]  To admit that you were wrong, is it not time for you to say to German communities and many others, I'm sorry for what I've done to you and the problems I've inflicted upon you for many decades to come?
[03:51:19.451 --> 03:51:24.533]  That was Nigel Farage earlier today in the European Parliament calling out Angela Merkel.
[03:51:24.933 --> 03:51:42.720]  Now bear in mind that it was only back in September that the Bundestag president Wolfgang Schäuble told Germans, and we had an article about this at the time, that they could completely forget about these one million refugees, and it's over one million, and most of them aren't refugees, who've flooded into Germany over the past three years from ever returning to their home countries.
[03:51:43.020 --> 03:51:46.341]  We've had violent crime in Germany rise over the last two years,
[03:51:48.040 --> 03:51:53.481]  90% of that violent crime rise is due to migrants according to the German government's own statistics.
[03:51:53.521 --> 03:52:00.263]  They tried to call Trump out over that and say he was wrong just because he didn't put the word violent in front of crime but those are the facts.
[03:52:01.343 --> 03:52:07.524]  Now 67.1% of all sudden gang rapes were committed by foreign migrants.
[03:52:07.564 --> 03:52:09.265]  These are new statistics out of Germany.
[03:52:09.805 --> 03:52:14.766]  Overwhelming majority of gang rapes in Germany committed by foreigners is the headline out of Voice of Europe.
[03:52:15.623 --> 03:52:19.566]  The gang rape of a German teen by seven Syrians in Freiburg has made the issue a hot topic.
[03:52:20.466 --> 03:52:31.813]  And now they've come to the conclusion from these latest stats that 67.1% of sudden gang rapes, that's not planned gang rapes, that's sudden gang rapes, were committed by foreigners last year.
[03:52:32.193 --> 03:52:34.235]  So they've got a massive problem with violent crime.
[03:52:34.475 --> 03:52:39.078]  They've got a massive problem with gang rapes, as we see in virtually every other country.
[03:52:39.458 --> 03:52:42.900]  Angela Merkel's political legacy is crashing and burning as a result of it.
[03:52:43.539 --> 03:52:44.899]  But the consequences remain.
[03:52:44.919 --> 03:52:47.680]  They're not doing anything to deport foreign migrants.
[03:52:47.720 --> 03:52:52.121]  In many cases they're more lenient than actual German criminals in dealing with them.
[03:52:53.001 --> 03:52:55.381]  We have another headline here out of Information Liberation.
[03:52:56.421 --> 03:52:57.322]  We love you Angola.
[03:52:57.402 --> 03:53:00.722]  Migrants say they're trekking to Europe because they love the lifestyle.
[03:53:01.282 --> 03:53:09.524]  Newly released video shows a group of Pakistani and Bangladeshi migrants explaining to an interviewer why they're working to illegally immigrate to Western Europe through the new Balkan route.
[03:53:10.439 --> 03:53:20.502]  One man from Bangladesh who said he and his group were paying around €9,000 each to make the journey, said they're trying to get to Western Europe not because they're fleeing war, but because, quote, we love the European lifestyle.
[03:53:20.842 --> 03:53:38.788]  So when you've got actual refugees who are actually fleeing war and persecution, actually fleeing potential death by remaining in their home countries, they're being displaced by the people who aren't, by the people who admittedly in their own words are going there to make money for the lifestyle.
[03:53:39.645 --> 03:53:42.229]  So the actual refugees are being put by the wayside.
[03:53:42.509 --> 03:53:48.558]  They can't afford to pay the criminal people smugglers who are conspiring with the NGOs to get them into these countries.
[03:53:48.859 --> 03:53:51.583]  So the actual refugees, the people who actually need help.
[03:53:52.344 --> 03:53:56.347]  Like the Pakistani woman who recently was denied asylum in Britain.
[03:53:56.668 --> 03:54:02.913]  They're being left behind because of these leftists and these NGOs with their bleeding hot crap as they present it.
[03:54:03.213 --> 03:54:11.660]  Whereas behind the scenes they're working with criminal people smugglers to get these people into these Western European countries who aren't refugees.
[03:54:12.692 --> 03:54:13.853]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:54:14.113 --> 03:54:24.543]  The children who actually need asylum, they're being cut off, they're being put to the wayside because you have a bunch of lying 30-year-olds with full beards being allowed into the country.
[03:54:24.823 --> 03:54:31.709]  And as we saw earlier with this new footage out of Lauren Southern and her organisation where advocates abroad, they admit,
[03:54:32.549 --> 03:54:38.753]  They teach migrants to lie to get into Western European countries because they're not refugees.
[03:54:39.293 --> 03:54:43.016]  So these NGOs are actually harming real refugees.
[03:54:43.356 --> 03:54:51.121]  There's also a brain drain of people out of those countries, the ones who can afford to pay people smugglers leaving those countries in the Middle East predominantly.
[03:54:51.481 --> 03:54:55.624]  So there's a brain drain and they're leaving the actual refugees behind.
[03:54:56.164 --> 03:55:00.607]  Absolutely incredible that they present themselves as these bleeding heart liberals
[03:55:02.614 --> 03:55:05.801]  They point at us and call us racist and heartless.
[03:55:06.042 --> 03:55:11.454]  If we followed our advice, they would actually free and provide asylum for real refugees.
[03:55:12.392 --> 03:55:13.473]  To a far greater degree.
[03:55:13.673 --> 03:55:28.284]  It's absolutely unconscionable what's happening and it only seems to be getting worse in terms of these NGOs being paid to criminally smuggle people into Western Europe who don't deserve it, who aren't fleeing war and who are not real refugees.
[03:55:28.304 --> 03:55:31.666]  We've been talking about it for three years and it's still going on.
[03:55:32.107 --> 03:55:38.912]  Maybe it will take more of these organisations to be exposed where they'll have to basically just run off the internet entirely as happened in this case.
[03:55:39.645 --> 03:55:42.367]  For this to get better and for serious questions to be asked.
[03:55:42.427 --> 03:55:44.769]  It's absolutely ludicrous, this situation.
[03:55:45.650 --> 03:55:46.551]  Final story, though.
[03:55:47.532 --> 03:55:49.533]  This went up on InfoWars.com about an hour ago.
[03:55:50.014 --> 03:55:53.957]  Professor warns Amazon Echo is always recording your conversations.
[03:55:54.357 --> 03:55:58.921]  Now, this is Nick Floor, an associate professor of information systems out of New Mexico.
[03:55:59.521 --> 03:56:08.569]  He was reacting to a story out of New Hampshire, where basically a man is accused of a double murder, stabbing two women to death in his home.
[03:56:09.443 --> 03:56:25.003]  The judge in this case gave New Hampshire authorities permission to examine audio recordings from Echo, which of course uses Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, to try and find out if there's any information as to what happened during this double murder.
[03:56:25.483 --> 03:56:28.107]  Now the problem is, as anyone will know,
[03:56:28.777 --> 03:56:50.002]  To access that recording system where Alexa or Echo responds to a command from the user, you have to give them the cue of saying, Alexa, why would a guy who is murdering two women in his home activate Alexa before he proceeds to commit the murder, unless Alexa is recording the conversations in real time?
[03:56:50.618 --> 03:56:56.061]  So Professor Nick Floor tweeted, quote, remember when Amazon claimed they only start recording when you said Alexa?
[03:56:56.442 --> 03:56:58.403]  Turns out that's a big freaking lie.
[03:56:58.863 --> 03:57:01.065]  These stupid devices are always recording.
[03:57:01.425 --> 03:57:07.869]  All it takes is one SJW working in Amazon support to leak all your conversations for the greater good.
[03:57:08.829 --> 03:57:09.790]  So he makes the point.
[03:57:10.350 --> 03:57:15.754]  They're not just recording when you give them the cue by saying, Alexa, tell me what the weather is today.
[03:57:16.074 --> 03:57:17.795]  They must be recording all the time.
[03:57:18.792 --> 03:57:25.257]  If these judges, if these authorities, are asking permission to access the audio files.
[03:57:25.598 --> 03:57:27.279]  Because why would he access Alexa?
[03:57:27.319 --> 03:57:31.022]  Why would he cue Amazon Echo before a double murder?
[03:57:31.042 --> 03:57:32.323]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[03:57:32.343 --> 03:57:36.026]  So now a top professor is calling that out for what it is.
[03:57:36.247 --> 03:57:38.709]  Absolutely incredible story up on InfoWars.com.
[03:57:38.729 --> 03:57:40.190]  I was going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:57:40.210 --> 03:57:42.552]  Coming up next is War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:43.212 --> 03:57:44.994]  Again, breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:45.014 --> 03:57:46.956]  Get all the great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:47.417 --> 03:57:47.877]  We'll be back.
[03:57:48.037 --> 03:57:48.578]  Don't go away.
[03:57:52.142 --> 03:57:57.247]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[03:57:59.560 --> 03:58:01.141]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[03:58:01.181 --> 03:58:01.782]  It's a good thing.
[03:58:01.822 --> 03:58:05.024]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:58:05.585 --> 03:58:08.007]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[03:58:08.027 --> 03:58:09.108]  I learned what the best was.
[03:58:09.788 --> 03:58:23.059]  And Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[03:58:23.539 --> 03:58:28.503]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[03:58:28.683 --> 03:58:33.127]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[03:58:33.627 --> 03:58:35.989]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[03:58:36.670 --> 03:58:41.054]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[03:58:42.728 --> 03:58:44.430]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:58:45.191 --> 03:58:47.473]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[03:58:47.493 --> 03:58:48.915]  That's when you get the best deals on cars.
[03:58:49.356 --> 03:58:54.902]  It's when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[03:58:55.102 --> 03:58:57.845]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[03:58:58.426 --> 03:58:59.647]  And that's not counting state taxes.
