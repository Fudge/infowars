[00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:18.231]  Rumors spreadin' round, United, Texas, town.
[00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.974]  Fighters stacked outside, no games.
[00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:25.556]  And you know what I'm talkin' about.
[00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:27.977]  Just let me know, if you wanna go.
[00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:42.149]  Well, the globalist takeover of America and the world isn't going quite like it was supposed to go.
[00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.935]  In fact, their operations are getting blown and destroyed all over the planet.
[00:00:46.576 --> 00:01:06.226]  They're viciously counter-striking back as the big red-blooded wave of pro-human nationalism, populism, and renaissance, the red blood that unifies us, surges back into the collective veins and arteries of the population of the world.
[00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:17.675]  Life is coming back into what appeared to be the dead corpse being fed on by the globalists, who were able to consolidate incredible power, consolidate trillions of dollars, while humanity was asleep.
[00:01:19.158 --> 00:01:22.021]  Now that they have an opponent, they don't know what to do.
[00:01:22.762 --> 00:01:23.543]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:01:23.643 --> 00:01:25.405]  It's Thursday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.367]  Already the 28th day of June 2018.
[00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:30.911]  We'll be live here for the next four hours.
[00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:39.621]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us with exclusive information about Ray and Rosenstein clearly perjuring themselves in the ongoing hearings.
[00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:48.428]  They've been caught red-handed before lying just like McCabe lied to Congress and said he wasn't involved in the program spying on the president.
[00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.891]  It is simply incredible when you follow what's really going on.
[00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:55.374]  I just saw 15 minutes ago live and they're watching it.
[00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:57.976]  Barely get ready for the broadcast I was glued to it.
[00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:00.057]  We've got some of these clips coming up.
[00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:02.719]  We're grabbing them still as we speak.
[00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:07.223]  We've got these individuals running around
[00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:12.908]  Rosenstein and others saying, oh we can't answer it.
[00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:20.151]  No, we have no knowledge of prior to June 2016, Trump being spied on.
[00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:26.674]  When they've all been caught, it's in the text messages, it's on record, that they were all in there doing it.
[00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:31.376]  And he also says that his staffers are lying, that he never threatened them.
[00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:32.476]  Rosenstein says that.
[00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:35.738]  It's just incredible.
[00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:44.048]  Solid gold in there, proving unbelievable ongoing perjury.
[00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:55.073]  Remember back when Comey was testifying last year, three times I told you he's perjuring there, he's perjuring there, and now it's all come out that they're lying under a
[00:02:56.365 --> 00:03:03.410]  So it'll take some while to go over all this, but just what I watched this morning was unbelievable lies.
[00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.793]  You couldn't write the lies down fast enough, and these guys playing dumb as well.
[00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:11.155]  So it's pretty amazing.
[00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:20.260]  Oh, Rosenstein knew nothing about them sending a Russian operative that was one of their operatives, who didn't even have a Russian name, trying to give them dirt on Hillary, wanting $2 million.
[00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:21.701]  He knew nothing about that.
[00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:22.262]  Well, guess what?
[00:03:23.148 --> 00:03:26.029]  They've been shredding documents, they've been refusing to give them to Congress.
[00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.651]  Now he's given them some of them that said, there's more, oh we don't know where they went, oh they got sent off to the shredder.
[00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:38.993]  He's talking about floundering and acting guilty, but trying to put on a little tough guy attitude.
[00:03:40.313 --> 00:03:41.674]  This is a sickening group of people.
[00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:46.695]  It's like McCabe said, oh I'm against the whole Russiagate thing, you know, I know they did this, I'm not political.
[00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:48.696]  And then it turned out he was running the whole thing.
[00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:51.756]  It's, it's sick.
[00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:56.100]  And now even the leftist Hill and others are saying, well, get ready to be disappointed.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.020]  There's really nothing there.
[00:03:57.361 --> 00:03:59.923]  There's nothing there on the Trump side, but there's plenty.
[00:04:01.364 --> 00:04:03.085]  There's plenty there on the Democrat side.
[00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:05.748]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:12.493]  We have the globalists in total conniption fits, uh, over the justice leaving.
[00:04:13.214 --> 00:04:15.596]  And of course it was Roger Stone telling you that he would be leaving.
[00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:24.098]  He's retiring, giving the leftists the biggest fits of fear they've had yet.
[00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:25.539]  We're going to be going through some of that.
[00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:26.760]  But here's the deal.
[00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.322]  Roger's getting on an airplane right now.
[00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:30.202]  He's off in three hours.
[00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:31.523]  But I talked to him right before he took off.
[00:04:32.664 --> 00:04:36.026]  And I remember what he and others told me back when the president was his president-elect.
[00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:42.171]  And then when the vacancy came up about who Trump's main pick was.
[00:04:43.678 --> 00:04:49.283]  But then they came to the president, and they said, sir, but you promised to go with the most conservative judge.
[00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:51.185]  We've got a computer program that's going to decide that.
[00:04:51.205 --> 00:04:54.588]  So he said, OK, in round one, we'll go with what the computer picks.
[00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.691]  Then in round two, we're picking somebody else, and I know who it is.
[00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:00.953]  So I know who the current pick is right now.
[00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:01.774]  We'll come back with that.
[00:05:03.562 --> 00:05:07.145]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:14.091]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google, they have filed 13 lawsuits, we've beaten six.
[00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:18.554]  But understand this, I am your soldier, you're my soldier, we're all in this together.
[00:05:19.588 --> 00:05:24.292]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:25.693]  So I salute you and I thank you.

[00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:09.371]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:09.873 --> 00:06:15.007]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:40.011]  You know, the whole globalist program to sabotage free markets, to bring in global tyranny run by megacorporations, using socialism and communism to domesticate populations, is being sabotaged by the people of the world waking up.
[00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.101]  So their attempt to sabotage us has now been reversed to a great extent.
[00:06:45.642 --> 00:06:54.206]  It's getting more intense every day and the red wave of red blood, pro-humanity, pro-free market, pro-destiny is rising.
[00:06:54.226 --> 00:06:57.228]  There's not just a red wave here in America coming.
[00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:00.650]  It's already hit many areas of the world.
[00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.793]  We're in a global war against corporate global government.
[00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:23.937]  And if you read what the Financial Times of London says, or what Conrad Black says, former steering member of the Bilderberg Group, or if you read what Atlantic Monthly says, or you read CIA reports that are restricted but not classified, they now know the globalists are losing.
[00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:26.519]  They are irrevocably in deep, deep trouble.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.781]  Now they've still got the trillions of dollars they stole.
[00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:31.543]  They can still engage in incredible mischief with that.
[00:07:32.554 --> 00:07:37.236]  But the Bezoses and the rest of the folks, the Bill Gateses out there, better watch it.
[00:07:38.337 --> 00:07:40.938]  Because if they want to fight, you better believe they've got one.
[00:07:41.898 --> 00:07:48.061]  So a lot of really, really exciting things happening and unfolding right now.
[00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:54.304]  Globalism was sold as this wonderful system of everybody living in equality and transferring wealth to the third world.
[00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.946]  But really it was a way to keep the third world controlled, drive down wages in the West,
[00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:06.575]  And then play the third world off against the West for total economic and cultural domination.
[00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:17.324]  Out of the clashing of civilizations, the UN, the IMF, the World Bank would then come in as the policeman of the world to stabilize the planet that they themselves had destabilized.
[00:08:17.944 --> 00:08:23.869]  Now I've been telling people that for 23 years because I read what Senator Barry Goldwater discovered when he was in the classified hearings.
[00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:29.455]  I also read what Tragedy and Hope author, who was on the enemy side, wrote in a 1,100 page book.
[00:08:29.795 --> 00:08:43.537]  And I read dozens and dozens of other books, hundreds of other magazine articles, from Foreign Affairs and others, who thought you were so stupid, who thought I was so stupid, that they would have their own admitted world government plan going on in plain view.
[00:08:44.818 --> 00:08:51.939]  But then, if we criticized it, have ABC, CBS, NBC, and then later CNN, MSNBC, say we were crazy.
[00:08:54.005 --> 00:08:55.766]  Oh, I don't want Obamacare.
[00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:56.487]  It's a rip-off.
[00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:57.227]  You're racist.
[00:08:57.767 --> 00:08:59.929]  I don't like the Federal Reserve being private and being above the law.
[00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:01.029]  You're anti-Semitic.
[00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.653]  These are the talking points that they used for decades on everybody, like Ron Paul and myself.
[00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:09.895]  But it didn't work, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:10.035 --> 00:09:10.695]  It didn't work.
[00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:14.158]  I mean, I remember 12 years ago, Drudge started linking to
[00:09:15.504 --> 00:09:24.694]  Foreign newspaper articles about Bilderberg and our media was so controlled the US they would say it was insane and didn't exist.
[00:09:26.055 --> 00:09:37.968]  Now they had articles this year saying that Bilderberg is saving the world, that Bilderberg tells the truth, that Bilderberg are the guardians of freedom.
[00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:40.887]  That was in CNBC just a few weeks ago.
[00:09:41.207 --> 00:09:52.303]  That a private consortium of mega banks and ultra-rich men meeting in secret to establish a world government taxation power that they're exempt from is a good thing.
[00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:59.300]  We have absolutely ultra-massive awakenings happening.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.781]  It doesn't mean, though, that there's some utopia on the other side.
[00:10:02.122 --> 00:10:20.930]  We've just got a better chance of building a better world and having prosperity and freedom now because we're identifying the current, global, corrupt, kleptocratic, authoritarian, austerity-based system with a goal of absolute total tyranny.
[00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.191]  This is the reality.
[00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:37.756]  And the victory over Hillary, the main minion of the globalists here in North America, the keeper of the secrets, the keeper of the corruption, and her big foundation with four billion dollars in it being used to pay everybody off to be part of this.
[00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:42.558]  You could say that beating her in the campaign was one step in the victory.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.021]  Beating her in the campaign was one step to victory.
[00:10:49.361 --> 00:10:51.202]  But just as you, in the mythical
[00:10:53.561 --> 00:10:57.665]  Greek story of her head being severed.
[00:10:58.405 --> 00:10:59.607]  That is only the first feat.
[00:11:00.587 --> 00:11:03.130]  You then have to defeat the globalist kraken with the head.
[00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:15.081]  But as a symbol of the globalist failure, as a symbol of their media lying that she'd be the winner, as the symbol of them saying Hillary must win or the dominoes falling to bring down globalism will be complete,
[00:11:16.607 --> 00:11:26.555]  Archetypally, Trump is now holding up the Gorgon head and all the corruption and all the secrets and the entire global network tied into her as one of the top managers.
[00:11:26.955 --> 00:11:35.481]  He now has the Medusan head to take on the Kraken of the global network, the Chi-Coms, the unelected EU, Hollywood, all of it.
[00:11:36.482 --> 00:11:44.188]  That's why we have to continue to use her and bring her up and show how evil she is and bad and how she's a fraud and the corruption she was involved in, all of it.
[00:11:45.481 --> 00:12:10.455]  Trail back into the enemy's nest, and her head is a blueprint to defeat them, and to expose their corruption, and have all the other dominoes fall in Washington, which will then fall into London, and Brussels, and Paris, right through into the Vatican, right through into Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
[00:12:11.417 --> 00:12:20.304]  Right through back into Berlin and Madrid, right through across Moscow, all the way into China.
[00:12:23.126 --> 00:12:24.468]  It's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:24.928 --> 00:12:37.598]  And so Trump now, like Perseus, with the head of Medusa, is ready to vanquish the globalists.
[00:12:37.618 --> 00:12:38.599]  The archetype is true.
[00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:39.840]  There's one more thing, though.
[00:12:41.172 --> 00:12:41.552]  A horse!
[00:12:43.434 --> 00:12:53.782]  If Trump doesn't have the air, if Trump can't get his ideas across, he can't get up in the Titan's face, the Kraken, and fry it!
[00:12:55.604 --> 00:12:56.945]  And that's why we're in an information war.
[00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:01.789]  We've got to get Trump on the horse, in the sky, with the head!
[00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.650]  And we'll win.
[00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:10.155]  So there is your analogy of Trump and the Gorgon and the Kraken.
[00:13:11.001 --> 00:13:13.402]  Because believe me, they are releasing the Kraken.
[00:13:13.782 --> 00:13:16.784]  Soros used to spend maybe a billion a year trying to overthrow governments and do evil stuff.
[00:13:17.184 --> 00:13:20.085]  He just put tens of billions in.
[00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:23.307]  It's 18 billion a year he's now spending, trying to vaporize everybody.
[00:13:23.687 --> 00:13:25.128]  They're just flamethrowing everything.
[00:13:25.408 --> 00:13:27.909]  The communist Chinese are just throwing everything they've got at us.
[00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:30.410]  I mean, this is World War IV.
[00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:36.113]  Between the globalists and all their corrupt allies and all the parasitic crap they do.
[00:13:37.256 --> 00:13:42.899]  I mean, almost any evil you investigate, you run into Soros, and the UN, and the IMF, and the World Bank.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:58.327]  Like most of, it was in the news yesterday, it was in Bloomberg, that most of the workers' comp and ambulance chaser, you know, exploding tire stuff in the country is financed by George Soros.
[00:13:59.928 --> 00:14:00.609]  And I already knew that.
[00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.470]  But think about that.
[00:14:05.151 --> 00:14:06.532]  Think about the level of that
[00:14:09.861 --> 00:14:10.302]  behavior.
[00:14:11.022 --> 00:14:15.047]  He spends millions in per county to get certain sheriffs elected.
[00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:18.411]  He spends tens of millions to get state reps elected.
[00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:21.235]  He has still spent a hundred million to get a congressman or woman elected.
[00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:23.658]  And he's doing it all over the world.
[00:14:26.421 --> 00:14:27.823]  Now, continuing ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:29.175 --> 00:14:31.216]  They are all in because they are losing.
[00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:32.217]  We are winning.
[00:14:32.717 --> 00:14:45.423]  Now coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to tell you currently, exclusively, hiding in plain view, who is currently the person about to be nominated to replace the outgoing Justice Kennedy.
[00:14:46.644 --> 00:14:48.225]  And I was told this back at the time.
[00:14:48.645 --> 00:14:49.825]  I know about what went on.
[00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:51.126]  I know the inside baseball.
[00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:52.086]  I was told all of it.
[00:14:52.427 --> 00:14:53.967]  And a lot of it came out later in the news.
[00:14:54.007 --> 00:14:58.750]  But I'm going to tell you who currently, it may change, but who currently
[00:15:00.475 --> 00:15:02.876]  They are looking to put on the U.S.
[00:15:02.896 --> 00:15:03.397]  Supreme Court.
[00:15:03.457 --> 00:15:05.158]  It couldn't be a better person.
[00:15:05.558 --> 00:15:11.161]  So I am very, very, very, very, very excited to be able to bring you this information.
[00:15:12.247 --> 00:15:14.048]  You might want to call your neighbors, your friends, your family.
[00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:20.592]  Tell them to tune in to InfoWars.com, or at SlashShow, or on the Twitter, or Facebook, or YouTube feeds, or on local TV stations, or radio stations where you're listening.
[00:15:20.932 --> 00:15:22.233]  That's how we reach more people.
[00:15:22.893 --> 00:15:24.494]  That's how we get around the censors.
[00:15:24.554 --> 00:15:29.397]  It's how we get into the air with the truth that's our weapon system.
[00:15:29.897 --> 00:15:31.558]  That we've severed the head of the globalists.
[00:15:32.138 --> 00:15:33.919]  That we've taken back control of the beachhead.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.122]  But now we've got to go face the larger global enemy.
[00:15:39.656 --> 00:15:41.537]  That has been turned loose against us.
[00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:43.198]  This was only step one.
[00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:54.586]  But severing the head of the deep state here is a weapon we must use against the larger enemy, the Chi-Coms, the Devil Pope, the EU, and Hollywood.
[00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:57.668]  That is the consortium, that is the Kraken that we now face.
[00:15:57.688 --> 00:15:59.149]  Newswars.com.
[00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:03.111]  Now!
[00:16:05.113 --> 00:16:06.434]  They think you're a goldfish!
[00:16:08.078 --> 00:16:10.159]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:11.519]  I believe in you!
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.060]  I don't think you're stupid!
[00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:17.722]  One man ever raped a woman!
[00:16:18.062 --> 00:16:19.662]  All genitals were cut off!
[00:16:19.902 --> 00:16:22.343]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[00:16:22.463 --> 00:16:23.684]  And we're not backing down on her!
[00:16:25.605 --> 00:16:26.545]  I want to kick these people!
[00:16:26.565 --> 00:16:27.285]  We're winning!
[00:16:27.345 --> 00:16:28.466]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:29.086]  Can't you?
[00:16:29.366 --> 00:16:30.987]  We have broken their back!
[00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:32.527]  Yes, I can feel it!
[00:16:36.369 --> 00:16:36.909]  Let's go!
[00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:38.771]  Come on!
[00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:39.071]  Come on!

[00:18:02.697 --> 00:18:06.139]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:09.420]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:15.743]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:18:16.203 --> 00:18:18.985]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:23.148]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:29.594]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:18:30.015 --> 00:18:34.979]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.122]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:18:39.643 --> 00:18:46.187]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:18:46.847 --> 00:18:51.530]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:18:52.091 --> 00:18:57.174]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:18:57.754 --> 00:19:01.717]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:07.095]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:07.135 --> 00:19:08.576]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:08.656 --> 00:19:09.297]  Go ahead.
[00:19:09.317 --> 00:19:09.397]  Yes.
[00:19:09.837 --> 00:19:10.538]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:10.658 --> 00:19:16.863]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:17.063 --> 00:19:21.046]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:21.287 --> 00:19:22.728]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:23.108 --> 00:19:29.814]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:19:29.874 --> 00:19:32.736]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:33.016 --> 00:19:36.418]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:19:36.738 --> 00:19:38.319]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:40.581]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation.
[00:19:40.601 --> 00:19:46.184]  Because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:52.028]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:52.168 --> 00:19:57.471]  It is our highest reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.553]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:20:06.003 --> 00:20:08.599]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.517 --> 00:20:25.679]  You found it.
[00:20:25.719 --> 00:20:28.382]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:20:28.783 --> 00:20:30.325]  It's the Infowar.
[00:20:30.825 --> 00:20:33.328]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:20:33.449 --> 00:20:35.311]  Okay, I've been on the phone.
[00:20:40.828 --> 00:20:50.132]  The folks basically asking me not to say who Trump has picked as the Supreme Court replacement for Justice Kennedy.
[00:20:51.633 --> 00:20:54.114]  And I was told by multiple sources at the time about this.
[00:20:54.995 --> 00:20:56.596]  And I was not told this in confidence.
[00:20:57.336 --> 00:20:59.157]  And we've even talked about this on air before.
[00:21:02.438 --> 00:21:09.702]  But I've already told you that I'm going to say who is, let's just say this then, in the front running.
[00:21:10.689 --> 00:21:12.570]  Even though this individual has been told, you're next.
[00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:13.671]  You're the next one.
[00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:18.514]  So I'm going to talk about that in the next segment.
[00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:21.436]  But this is big breaking exclusive news.
[00:21:23.397 --> 00:21:26.539]  If you weren't listening to the broadcast when the last guy got put in.
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:28.661]  Gorsuch.
[00:21:31.002 --> 00:21:32.283]  So this will be exclusive.
[00:21:33.264 --> 00:21:39.888]  This information is directly from El Presidente.
[00:21:42.261 --> 00:21:46.924]  Then I made some phone calls and they're like, well, yeah, that's the case, but that could change.
[00:21:46.984 --> 00:21:49.005]  Definitely in the hunt, in the front of the running.
[00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:51.767]  But then why can't InfoWars have the big exclusive?
[00:21:51.807 --> 00:21:52.087]  You see?
[00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:55.369]  That's the establishment cannot stand that.
[00:21:55.409 --> 00:22:00.872]  But I know there's a lot of smart people too that just say, who knows how that fits into the calculus or whatever.
[00:22:01.252 --> 00:22:03.134]  It's just very, very exciting things are happening.
[00:22:03.874 --> 00:22:07.276]  And I couldn't think of a better Supreme Court person to be put in there.
[00:22:07.296 --> 00:22:08.857]  I'm sure most of you already know who we're talking about.
[00:22:09.137 --> 00:22:10.318]  A lot of you listen every day.
[00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:16.951]  I mean, you know that we break literally most of the big news.
[00:22:17.772 --> 00:22:18.312]  It's crazy.
[00:22:19.113 --> 00:22:24.077]  We listed all three FBI moles inside the Trump campaign first, by name.
[00:22:24.858 --> 00:22:30.382]  We knew a year before who they were, but didn't want to get sued by them.
[00:22:35.366 --> 00:22:40.130]  So, people that listen every day, you know you get tomorrow's news, next year's news today.
[00:22:40.991 --> 00:22:43.713]  That said, we've got some very exciting video right now.
[00:22:45.077 --> 00:22:46.438]  We've got it queued up from C-SPAN.
[00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:48.400]  It's amazing.
[00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:51.722]  And it's Gowdy.
[00:22:52.243 --> 00:22:53.044]  Say what you want about him.
[00:22:53.084 --> 00:22:55.305]  He's now saying, your investigation's hurting America.
[00:22:55.706 --> 00:22:56.406]  It's a fraud.
[00:22:56.426 --> 00:22:57.848]  This whole thing's a scam.
[00:22:58.368 --> 00:23:05.594]  Jim Jordan annihilates the FBI director and his corrupt boss, who thinks he's the head of the Justice Department, Rosenstein.
[00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:10.138]  And both men are caught lying, especially Rosenstein.
[00:23:11.445 --> 00:23:12.265]  Perjuring themselves.
[00:23:12.366 --> 00:23:12.946]  It's incredible.
[00:23:12.966 --> 00:23:14.467]  I mean, it's just as bad as Comey.
[00:23:14.567 --> 00:23:15.067]  It's amazing.
[00:23:15.567 --> 00:23:18.229]  Oh, they know nothing about an investigation prior to June of 2016.
[00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:21.670]  When it's on record, they all knew about the investigation going on in 2015.
[00:23:23.353 --> 00:23:26.474]  They knew nothing about money being paid to Fusion GPS to make up the dossier.
[00:23:26.714 --> 00:23:27.434]  They know nothing.
[00:23:27.454 --> 00:23:28.014]  They know nothing.
[00:23:28.154 --> 00:23:29.935]  It's like an episode of Hogan's Heroes.
[00:23:30.635 --> 00:23:31.615]  I know nothing.
[00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:33.296]  Nothing.
[00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:34.936]  It's ridiculous.
[00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:39.177]  That's why suddenly AP, Reuters, The Hill, New York Times, Russiagate's over.
[00:23:39.397 --> 00:23:40.517]  You're gonna get disappointed.
[00:23:40.797 --> 00:23:41.218]  It's over.
[00:23:41.278 --> 00:23:41.738]  It's done.
[00:23:41.818 --> 00:23:42.278]  What are we gonna do?
[00:23:44.349 --> 00:23:47.730]  Don't think Mueller and those corrupt loons are going to throw the towel in.
[00:23:47.971 --> 00:23:49.231]  They're just going to make up more crap.
[00:23:49.271 --> 00:23:50.832]  But this is quite a spectacle.
[00:23:50.872 --> 00:24:02.657]  Democrats saying, attack the family, kidnap Trump's son, murder everyone, kill me, kill more members of Congress, firebomb talk show host, firebomb Steven Crowder.
[00:24:03.097 --> 00:24:05.558]  I can't even keep track of the crazy stuff they're doing now.
[00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:08.019]  And physically,
[00:24:09.167 --> 00:24:12.268]  Like, trying to lynch mob me on the street while I walk around the leftist area.
[00:24:13.229 --> 00:24:14.329]  They're lunatics.
[00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:16.110]  Until you stand up, then they start crapping themselves.
[00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.290]  Like, go ahead!
[00:24:18.311 --> 00:24:19.191]  Big, tough guys!
[00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:21.192]  This isn't a simulation!
[00:24:21.212 --> 00:24:22.432]  What do you think?
[00:24:22.472 --> 00:24:23.213]  I'm playing games?
[00:24:23.293 --> 00:24:24.533]  You think the President's playing games?
[00:24:24.953 --> 00:24:26.274]  We're taking the country back.
[00:24:27.754 --> 00:24:32.056]  So, in this segment and the next, I'm going to play powerful clips from the hearings going on today.
[00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:36.538]  And in the last segment of this hour, because I want to make some phone calls in the breaks,
[00:24:38.103 --> 00:24:40.905]  To get the best statement I can make on this, because what I said is accurate.
[00:24:43.186 --> 00:24:49.850]  I know who the president told, you are my next nominee after the first one.
[00:24:52.452 --> 00:24:55.574]  But then the issue is I was never told, don't talk about that.
[00:24:57.406 --> 00:24:59.949]  Then it becomes, well, don't steal the President's fire.
[00:25:00.189 --> 00:25:01.210]  The President doesn't care!
[00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.513]  The President and his folks have told me, attack!
[00:25:03.753 --> 00:25:04.414]  Press the attack!
[00:25:04.654 --> 00:25:07.558]  I can't be sitting here politicking, trying to always calculate every angle!
[00:25:08.797 --> 00:25:09.077]  We'll see.
[00:25:09.117 --> 00:25:10.118]  We'll see what I get into.
[00:25:10.638 --> 00:25:15.040]  Right now, let's go to this quick clip from Fox, and then we'll go to the actual clip from C-SPAN, the full clip.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.400]  Here it is.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:25.745]  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein going before the House Judiciary Committee about the Department of Justice and FBI's actions in the run-up to the 2016 election.
[00:25:26.225 --> 00:25:35.249]  GOP Congressman Trey Gowdy slamming bias within the agencies and demanding more transparency for the American people in their ongoing investigations.
[00:25:36.863 --> 00:25:38.123]  Russia attacked this country.
[00:25:38.163 --> 00:25:39.284]  They should be the target.
[00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:42.465]  But Russia isn't being hurt by this investigation right now.
[00:25:42.645 --> 00:25:42.985]  We are.
[00:25:43.565 --> 00:25:45.206]  This country is being hurt by it.
[00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:46.406]  We are being divided.
[00:25:46.886 --> 00:25:54.249]  If you have evidence of wrongdoing by any member of the Trump campaign, present it to the damn grand jury.
[00:25:55.029 --> 00:26:00.491]  If you have evidence that this president acted inappropriately, present it to the American people.
[00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:06.155]  I think the best thing we can do is finish it appropriately and reach a conclusion.
[00:26:06.195 --> 00:26:11.478]  And I certainly agree with you, sir, that people should not jump to conclusions without seeing the evidence.
[00:26:11.498 --> 00:26:13.440]  I've been the victim of fake news attacks myself.
[00:26:16.142 --> 00:26:18.703]  He's been the victim of fake news attacks himself.
[00:26:19.204 --> 00:26:28.130]  He just lied to the president over and over again and knew about this whole thing and put a bunch of papers in front of him to change the command structure of the Justice Department to put him in charge of everything?
[00:26:31.257 --> 00:26:38.243]  Rosenstein, at bare minimum, is a cowardly traitor to this country who hedged his bets with Hillary and then tried to cover it up.
[00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:43.627]  But evidence shows they've still been continuing their criminal operations against the President and this Republic.
[00:26:43.947 --> 00:26:51.173]  And that has a name when you try to overthrow the vote of the country when you've got a President and people executing the Constitution faithfully.
[00:26:52.154 --> 00:26:54.116]  It's called treason, brother.
[00:26:54.136 --> 00:26:56.458]  So we're going to go to break.
[00:26:56.478 --> 00:26:59.821]  We're going to come back with the full clips from
[00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.466]  The highlights of what happened today.
[00:27:02.526 --> 00:27:17.537]  Now, that said, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is the tip of the spear, recognized as the shock troops of the rebirth of pro-human, populist, western, renaissance ideas globally.
[00:27:18.057 --> 00:27:21.320]  So therefore, we're under a mitigated demonization attack, you name it.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.364]  And that's why when you share the links, the videos, the articles, it is an act of resistance and victory over the enemy.
[00:27:27.584 --> 00:27:28.625]  Of course you're going to be attacked.
[00:27:29.764 --> 00:27:30.725]  Of course they're going to come at you.
[00:27:30.865 --> 00:27:32.526]  We're not trying to be popular with the enemy.
[00:27:32.846 --> 00:27:33.627]  We're trying to win.
[00:27:33.887 --> 00:27:38.070]  And we are winning, but we're in the thick of the battle and must press the attack right now.
[00:27:39.071 --> 00:27:41.913]  We're winning, they're scared, they're throwing everything they got at us.
[00:27:42.373 --> 00:27:45.736]  They could still win if we don't press the attack.
[00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:48.038]  That means go full out.
[00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:50.099]  That's what we're doing.
[00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:52.301]  I'm trying to expand, I'm trying to full out here.
[00:27:52.661 --> 00:27:53.161]  And they know it.
[00:27:54.482 --> 00:27:55.263]  I need fuel.
[00:27:55.583 --> 00:27:56.364]  And I make it easy.
[00:27:57.807 --> 00:28:00.088]  Fuel, energy symbols, and this world is money.
[00:28:01.189 --> 00:28:23.279]  And when you buy fluoride-free, high-quality toothpaste you need, or any of the 80-plus great supplements we have, or books, or t-shirts, or films, or all sorts of great preparedness items, thousands of great items, at infowarshore.com, you are fueling one of the main information warfare batteries, one of the main guns that is smashing enemy emplacements and burning them to the ground right now.
[00:28:24.266 --> 00:28:42.295]  So, if you want to crush the globalists, you want to continue to win, win, win, win, win, and get tired of winning, and see the whole culture turn around, your kids' futures be secured, communism finally destroyed, life-essential technologies released, if you want it all, then you've got to fund those that are willing to hit the barbed wire first.
[00:28:43.351 --> 00:28:49.654]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:50.454 --> 00:28:59.417]  We've got huge sales, 50% off the high-quality toothpaste right now, 33% off the SleepAid knockout that's a bestseller, the Alexa Pure Breezes, all of them.
[00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:00.638]  Red Wave Worldwide!
[00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:08.163]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:29:08.183 --> 00:29:08.683]  Thanks for calling.
[00:29:08.743 --> 00:29:09.663]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:29:09.803 --> 00:29:13.705]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:22.488]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:29:22.648 --> 00:29:38.805]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[00:29:39.305 --> 00:29:47.834]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:29:47.914 --> 00:29:52.679]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:58.425]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[00:30:07.794 --> 00:30:17.138]  A few years ago, ideas that we talked about were thought to be fringe ideas, radical ideas, extremist ideas.
[00:30:17.158 --> 00:30:19.720]  Those ideas are now mainstream.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.541]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.
[00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:34.747]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.432]  Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c***.
[00:30:46.552 --> 00:30:50.614]  What's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women?
[00:30:50.774 --> 00:30:55.216]  One way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy, so please, bring on the recession.
[00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:59.138]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:30:59.318 --> 00:31:03.960]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:31:09.506 --> 00:31:13.793]  It has been said that the Republican Party's testicles just dropped.
[00:31:14.744 --> 00:31:17.806]  That wasn't an Infowars.com ad you just saw.
[00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:20.247]  That was officially put out by the Republican Party.
[00:31:20.927 --> 00:31:34.313]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're finally getting the fact that the globalists are trying to start a violent revolution in this country and overthrow it and bring it down just like Venezuela and so many others that have fallen to socialism and communism.
[00:31:34.694 --> 00:31:39.456]  The globalists recognize that Infowars has been on the very front lines of this global awakening.
[00:31:39.856 --> 00:31:40.096]  I think?
[00:32:10.076 --> 00:32:16.999]  With products like Super Blue, Fluoride Free, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Immune Gargle, and so much more.
[00:32:17.299 --> 00:32:18.680]  Fortified with Colloil Silver.

[00:32:26.283 --> 00:32:33.666]  You help your teeth, you help your body, you help your gums, you help your country, you help your planet through free market, free association.
[00:32:34.744 --> 00:32:41.351]  The products are 50% off right now going through our super sale that we're going to have on July 4th.
[00:32:41.912 --> 00:32:42.913]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:43.273 --> 00:32:44.334]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:44.755 --> 00:32:57.408]  This is where you finance the second American revolution with the United States now attempting to stop the global government empire, attempting to take back control of our destiny on a global scale.
[00:33:06.989 --> 00:33:09.613]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:35.895]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:40.119]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.121]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:33:42.601 --> 00:33:44.243]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:33:44.803 --> 00:33:46.525]  John has a long mustache.
[00:33:46.785 --> 00:33:48.447]  John has a long mustache.
[00:33:48.847 --> 00:33:51.610]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.814]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:03.142]  But they took a lot of people away.
[00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:05.504]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[00:34:05.704 --> 00:34:08.326]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[00:34:08.927 --> 00:34:09.207]  Where?
[00:34:10.308 --> 00:34:12.149]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:20.335]  So why do we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids who belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities?
[00:34:20.616 --> 00:34:24.518]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:34:29.828 --> 00:34:36.290]  I'm a sorry citizen, I refuse to recognize you guys.
[00:34:44.292 --> 00:34:46.033]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:34:46.053 --> 00:34:47.093]  would you see that happening?
[00:34:47.153 --> 00:34:51.254]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:34:51.934 --> 00:35:00.076]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:35:01.697 --> 00:35:07.558]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[00:35:07.718 --> 00:35:12.260]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[00:35:19.062 --> 00:35:21.363]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[00:35:21.603 --> 00:35:25.646]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:27.707]  Put your gun down, really?
[00:35:29.868 --> 00:35:34.290]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:35:34.851 --> 00:35:36.392]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:35:36.672 --> 00:35:38.653]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[00:35:41.367 --> 00:35:46.374]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:49.218]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:35:49.699 --> 00:35:53.584]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:36:07.688 --> 00:36:15.933]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a wolverine.
[00:36:16.653 --> 00:36:18.995]  Wolverines!
[00:36:19.975 --> 00:36:22.097]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:27.648]  You know, the left attacks me and they go, oh, you're now for the military and for the police.
[00:36:28.429 --> 00:36:30.530]  You always hated him and you were the big police state guy.
[00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:42.195]  No, I was against the left and the globalists and the Ford Foundation and the Southern Poverty Law Center with the training manuals, with the video that police and military sent us because they cared.
[00:36:42.695 --> 00:36:47.698]  Being trained that America was bad, that the Bill of Rights is bad, that George Washington is bad.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:55.182]  That free market is bad and that gun owners are going to have to be put in FEMA camps.
[00:36:56.702 --> 00:37:03.305]  Now you just heard Wesley Clark from CNN four years ago saying, segregate constitutionalists.
[00:37:03.985 --> 00:37:04.725]  Well guess what you did?
[00:37:07.206 --> 00:37:09.247]  20 years ago a lot of the police and military were buying it.
[00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:10.968]  Not all of them, but 20-30%.
[00:37:15.729 --> 00:37:17.310]  But then when you turned up the heat,
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.701]  With Obama.
[00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:25.868]  And openly said the UN is going to run the police departments and we're going to take the guns.
[00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:35.098]  The police, the military, A, weren't anti-American at their base and knew that was wrong, but B, they also knew that's a suicide mission!
[00:37:36.067 --> 00:37:37.787]  What type of crazy crap is that?
[00:37:38.628 --> 00:37:44.189]  Why do you got us training to take on people saying we're constitutionalists, don't take my farm, don't take my land?
[00:37:44.209 --> 00:37:45.870]  Because that's what the training was for.
[00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:56.872]  And you idiot globalists took this broadcast and would tell the military and police, do not listen to this.
[00:37:57.272 --> 00:37:58.193]  This is the enemy.
[00:37:58.953 --> 00:38:00.413]  He says he wants to kill you.
[00:38:01.153 --> 00:38:03.074]  And they would tune in and hear the complete opposite.
[00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.971]  And so now they try to spin that whole thing around.
[00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:15.432]  They want control of the police and military to carry out tyranny like they do in Cuba or Venezuela or North Korea.
[00:38:16.673 --> 00:38:17.733]  Or like the EU's doing.
[00:38:18.533 --> 00:38:19.913]  That's not what we're talking about.
[00:38:19.953 --> 00:38:21.213]  They get the police to do a lot of bad stuff?
[00:38:21.233 --> 00:38:21.453]  Yeah.
[00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:24.054]  Are the police perfect?
[00:38:24.114 --> 00:38:24.654]  Absolutely not.
[00:38:24.774 --> 00:38:26.795]  The point is there are police.
[00:38:27.095 --> 00:38:28.175]  It's our military.
[00:38:28.375 --> 00:38:29.755]  We're taking it back from the globalists.
[00:38:30.075 --> 00:38:32.296]  They don't know what to do.
[00:38:32.556 --> 00:38:33.676]  They are scared.
[00:38:34.991 --> 00:38:37.151]  And we're taking the FBI back, and we're taking it all back.
[00:38:41.172 --> 00:38:46.433]  But think about them saying he's as mean as a wolverine on Don Lemon's show, the old prune.
[00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:49.494]  Dan Rather.
[00:38:53.575 --> 00:38:54.135]  Think about him.
[00:38:56.055 --> 00:38:57.615]  They're the ones saying kill Trump's family.
[00:38:57.655 --> 00:39:01.176]  Trump's turning the economy on, being nice, bringing folks together, but what he is, is tough.
[00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:07.421]  If he doesn't roll over when you attack him, you bullies, then you act like, oh he's so uncivil!
[00:39:07.861 --> 00:39:08.682]  They're so mean!
[00:39:08.782 --> 00:39:12.563]  No, we've been putting up with your bullying and your lies forever, and we are done.
[00:39:13.324 --> 00:39:16.045]  And we're proving that you had us under suppression.
[00:39:16.925 --> 00:39:18.526]  We just took America back up to the surface.
[00:39:19.626 --> 00:39:20.146]  Our listeners.
[00:39:20.307 --> 00:39:20.607]  Trump.
[00:39:20.887 --> 00:39:21.187]  All of us.
[00:39:21.207 --> 00:39:21.867]  The Patriot Movement.
[00:39:22.047 --> 00:39:22.547]  Worldwide.
[00:39:22.588 --> 00:39:23.108]  We're the leaders.
[00:39:23.288 --> 00:39:24.068]  We proved we were right.
[00:39:24.288 --> 00:39:25.669]  We're already turning it around instantly.
[00:39:27.162 --> 00:39:29.623]  We're like giving oxygen to somebody that's been trapped underwater.
[00:39:29.984 --> 00:39:32.505]  Or water to somebody that's been in the Sahara Desert for three days.
[00:39:33.205 --> 00:39:35.547]  And people know, they're like, oh, oh, this is great air!
[00:39:35.567 --> 00:39:37.328]  I can breathe, oh, water, thank you!
[00:39:37.348 --> 00:39:37.708]  Wow!
[00:39:37.728 --> 00:39:39.369]  And it's like, whoa, yeah!
[00:39:40.049 --> 00:39:43.431]  And then the, the globalists go, we're gonna wreck America and burn it and have a depression!
[00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:44.411]  On TV!
[00:39:44.431 --> 00:39:47.413]  People go, wow, Alex Jones always said you wanted to make us poor.
[00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:49.234]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:49.994 --> 00:39:50.675]  They're scum.
[00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:54.299]  We got a bunch of these clips.
[00:39:54.319 --> 00:39:55.200]  Let's get to Trey Gowdy.
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:02.362]  We got Jim Jordan and then Roger Stone's joining us to walk us through who is the number one pick for Supreme Court justice.
[00:40:02.422 --> 00:40:18.707]  I mean, he's been told you're it second round, but we're just going to say he's in the running at the front pole position, but he hadn't crossed that line yet because we don't want to box El Presidente in, but he almost always does what he says he'll do, right?
[00:40:19.987 --> 00:40:20.087]  So.
[00:40:21.076 --> 00:40:26.620]  I think about a 95% chance of Judge... coming up next segment.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.942]  Let's go ahead and go to Craig Gowdy.
[00:40:28.982 --> 00:40:29.242]  Here it is.
[00:40:30.407 --> 00:40:34.010]  The chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Gowdy, for five minutes.
[00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:35.231]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:40:35.251 --> 00:40:38.734]  The Russia investigation has been going on for almost two years now.
[00:40:38.914 --> 00:40:43.998]  Special counsel's investigation has been going on for over a year now.
[00:40:44.098 --> 00:40:51.524]  For most Americans, it's important to know what Russia did to our country in 2016 and with whom, if anyone, they did it.
[00:40:51.924 --> 00:40:59.009]  When a foreign state interferes with our democratic electoral process, it should be a chance of a lifetime.
[00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:06.854]  For a law enforcement agent to investigate that, except, apparently, the one that was actually picked to investigate it.
[00:41:07.935 --> 00:41:08.976]  That was Peter Strzok.
[00:41:09.096 --> 00:41:16.761]  FBI agent Peter Strzok was picked to lead the FBI's investigation into what Russia did in July of 2016.
[00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:25.306]  It was a counterintelligence investigation begun in late July 2016, and he was leading it at about the exact same time.
[00:41:25.746 --> 00:41:26.747]  He was picked to lead it,
[00:41:27.657 --> 00:41:36.781]  This dispassionate and fair FBI agent was calling Trump a disaster, destabilizing for the country.
[00:41:37.721 --> 00:41:43.644]  I'll leave out all the F adjectives he used to describe that.
[00:41:43.684 --> 00:41:45.925]  I'll just go with disaster and destabilizing.
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:59.367]  Same time his FBI lawyer girlfriend, Lisa Page, was telling him he was meant to protect the country, this neutral, dispassionate FBI agent said, I can protect the country at many levels.
[00:42:00.822 --> 00:42:13.348]  Same time, Peter Strzok, who was picked to objectively, fairly, neutrally look into the Russia investigation, was talking about an insurance policy with Andy McCabe and Lisa Page in the event Donald Trump became the president.
[00:42:14.009 --> 00:42:22.413]  All of this was happening at the same time Peter Strzok said he could smell the Trump support in Southern Virginia.
[00:42:23.834 --> 00:42:25.455]  All this was at the same time.
[00:42:26.462 --> 00:42:31.424]  That this FBI agent said a Trump presidency would be effing terrifying.
[00:42:32.565 --> 00:42:33.985]  And that it will never happen.
[00:42:34.086 --> 00:42:36.547]  No, no, we'll stop it.
[00:42:37.227 --> 00:42:37.727]  We'll be back.
[00:42:37.767 --> 00:42:40.148]  So while investigating... Very powerful at the end.
[00:42:40.168 --> 00:42:41.069]  And we got Jim Jordan.
[00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:43.870]  But remember though, he doesn't even get into this.
[00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:44.991]  It was Trump covered up.
[00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:47.592]  Hillary and Russia and Uranium One.
[00:42:48.639 --> 00:42:52.824]  Trach needs to be going to prison for life if he's lucky.
[00:42:52.884 --> 00:42:59.212]  Seriously, this guy would overthrow the will of the people and stop our republic coming back and screw our children's futures over?
[00:42:59.553 --> 00:43:00.294]  Good God!
[00:43:03.439 --> 00:43:07.402]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[00:43:07.462 --> 00:43:14.929]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[00:43:14.989 --> 00:43:20.814]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[00:43:24.257 --> 00:43:27.199]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:28.981]  But he didn't give up.
[00:43:30.265 --> 00:43:30.725]  And he won.
[00:43:31.526 --> 00:43:33.867]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[00:43:34.628 --> 00:43:38.711]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall to get a victory.
[00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:43.214]  The Alamo stood and fought Victor or death Colonel Travis.
[00:43:44.314 --> 00:43:45.215]  And they all died.
[00:43:45.455 --> 00:43:46.796]  All 180 plus men.
[00:43:47.276 --> 00:43:52.180]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[00:43:53.781 --> 00:43:58.004]  So I don't know how the Infowars fight is gonna end.
[00:43:58.204 --> 00:43:59.825]  But I know this.
[00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:14.860]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:22.686]  I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[00:44:24.147 --> 00:44:27.809]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[00:44:28.763 --> 00:44:30.924]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes.
[00:44:30.944 --> 00:44:36.307]  It's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:50.155]  But that said, just like our information is game-changing, the products that we sell, all of them, are powerful.
[00:44:50.615 --> 00:44:53.136]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there,
[00:44:54.953 --> 00:44:59.676]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less, or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[00:45:01.017 --> 00:45:11.404]  PQQ, CoQ10, and the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[00:45:11.804 --> 00:45:18.489]  They sell PQQ in little bottles with a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powdered capsule.
[00:45:19.685 --> 00:45:24.446]  And it is, again, the third as much, and it's like 40, 50 bucks for a little bottle.
[00:45:25.507 --> 00:45:27.027]  Think about that.
[00:45:27.107 --> 00:45:27.927]  It's $74 right now.
[00:45:28.868 --> 00:45:33.789]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:36.150]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:44.532]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[00:45:44.872 --> 00:45:46.573]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[00:45:47.593 --> 00:45:54.617]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product So I'm not gambled.
[00:45:55.198 --> 00:45:56.058]  I know you want value.
[00:45:56.098 --> 00:46:13.108]  So we bought even more of it We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it and we've got it right now At the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere DNA force go read the five-star reviews thousands of go see what people said it did for them.
[00:46:13.548 --> 00:46:14.489]  It is dramatic
[00:46:15.703 --> 00:46:23.466]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[00:46:24.207 --> 00:46:32.730]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:39.813]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[00:46:42.691 --> 00:46:48.293]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[00:46:48.513 --> 00:46:48.974]  That's fine.
[00:46:50.414 --> 00:46:51.455]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:52.575]  I'm funded by you.
[00:46:52.795 --> 00:46:53.695]  So thank you all.
[00:46:54.356 --> 00:46:59.338]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[00:46:59.898 --> 00:47:02.599]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.982]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.326 --> 00:47:27.827]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:47:28.407 --> 00:47:38.191]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.172 --> 00:47:46.614]  It is phenomenal how much Trump has been delivering on his promises and how the world is turning around.
[00:47:48.513 --> 00:47:51.956]  The globalists are hell-bent on stopping the American and global recovery.
[00:47:52.376 --> 00:48:00.743]  They admit from Juncker at the EU to Bill Maher on HBO that they want to crash the US economy to teach Trump supporters a lesson.
[00:48:02.945 --> 00:48:04.026]  Talk about Hitlerian!
[00:48:05.186 --> 00:48:07.448]  This is unbelievable the period of history we're in.
[00:48:07.769 --> 00:48:12.012]  Well, I remember back when the president got in and then there was a Supreme Court vacancy.
[00:48:13.793 --> 00:48:14.314]  I remember
[00:48:16.846 --> 00:48:21.229]  That it was in the news some that Andrew Napolitano was in the running.
[00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.313]  But then later I learned from inside sources, not just Roger Stone,
[00:48:28.092 --> 00:48:38.575]  That Trump used a big computer program and worked with some big study groups to look at who had the most conservative federal voting record, because he promised to go with the most conservative judge.
[00:48:39.236 --> 00:48:42.597]  And some of his experts argued, well, that's not Napolitano because he was a state judge.
[00:48:42.617 --> 00:48:44.237]  Yes, he's very conservative on air.
[00:48:44.277 --> 00:48:45.377]  Yes, he's a very smart guy.
[00:48:45.698 --> 00:48:47.718]  But we're talking about federal judges up front right now.
[00:48:48.078 --> 00:48:50.019]  Wouldn't it be best to go with
[00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:55.260]  A federal judge first, and that he said, OK, I'll do that.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:03.023]  So I can technically say I've appointed the most conservative person on the bench currently, who has a bigger, longer record.
[00:49:03.963 --> 00:49:11.165]  But my good friend, Andrew Napolitano, he is going to be at the front of the running on the next round.
[00:49:11.786 --> 00:49:13.266]  In fact, it was more specific than that.
[00:49:13.526 --> 00:49:15.367]  I asked Roger at the time if that was accurate.
[00:49:15.567 --> 00:49:17.427]  He's very close friends with Napolitano.
[00:49:17.447 --> 00:49:18.328]  You could say they're best friends.
[00:49:19.348 --> 00:49:21.449]  And he told me some stuff.
[00:49:22.301 --> 00:49:34.151]  Now, to tell you before I went on air, even though I thought Roger was on a plane, he was just getting on one, I called Roger to see if I could say what I was told from the other sources, even though they didn't tell me this in confidence.
[00:49:35.832 --> 00:49:42.018]  In fact, I talked to another individual that talked to Napolitano, and I'm going to leave it at that, and he said, yes, indeed, I was told that.
[00:49:43.177 --> 00:49:43.437]  I don't
[00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:03.778]  There's kind of this metaphoric, metaphysical thing where it's easy to fall back if you're seen as starting in first place.
[00:50:03.798 --> 00:50:09.843]  So let's just say he is at the very front of the pack here, and I think the very best person for a lot of reasons.
[00:50:10.403 --> 00:50:11.303]  His cell phone's about to die.
[00:50:11.424 --> 00:50:13.505]  He's going to get home and join us via Skype in about an hour.
[00:50:13.925 --> 00:50:17.007]  But Roger Stone, flesh this out for folks as best we can.
[00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:18.568]  We're giving people a world exclusive here.
[00:50:18.588 --> 00:50:20.350]  A lot of this is inside baseball.
[00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:28.395]  I was not told this in confidence, but I still called you and brought up my sources because you had told me similar things and said, do you think we should roll this out?
[00:50:29.536 --> 00:50:32.738]  You know, Alex, everything you just said is absolutely accurate.
[00:50:32.918 --> 00:50:37.341]  We know that Judge Napolitano is a personal favorite of the president.
[00:50:37.361 --> 00:50:43.845]  The president describes him as the one judge who makes federal law understandable and the Constitution understandable.
[00:50:44.586 --> 00:50:48.288]  The argument against him in the previous round was that he was a state judge.
[00:50:48.788 --> 00:50:52.351]  By the way, Felix Frankfurter was a state judge.
[00:50:53.437 --> 00:50:56.418]  Uh, that is really of no consequence.
[00:50:57.058 --> 00:51:04.440]  The president did feel in the first round that he had to go with a list that had been recommended by the Federalist Society.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:10.382]  Napolitano was not on that list, although he certainly could have been based on qualifications.
[00:51:11.182 --> 00:51:21.245]  Having now fulfilled that commitment, I don't believe the president, or I don't know, but I'm not sure the president will feel that he must select from that list again, particularly
[00:51:22.074 --> 00:51:25.216]  As long as his nominee is a solid conservative.
[00:51:26.357 --> 00:51:29.439]  I think Napolitano is very, very much in the hunt.
[00:51:29.599 --> 00:51:36.183]  I think he was the president's emotional choice for the previous nomination.
[00:51:37.024 --> 00:51:46.430]  And it would be a great statement because the judge is a great conservative, but he's also a great libertarian, very much pro-freedom.
[00:51:47.185 --> 00:51:49.067]  So, I'm optimistic.
[00:51:49.188 --> 00:51:53.553]  I think that the left will deride him as a box-talking head.
[00:51:54.334 --> 00:51:57.077]  But he is, by any measure, brilliant.
[00:51:58.038 --> 00:52:00.281]  And I know he has the high regard of the president.
[00:52:03.064 --> 00:52:06.589]  I don't want to get into too much of the inside of the tales, but just specifically,
[00:52:08.496 --> 00:52:10.158]  He's at the top of the list this round.
[00:52:10.459 --> 00:52:12.582]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is currently at the top of the list.
[00:52:12.922 --> 00:52:18.930]  How do we make sure he stays at the top and gets in there despite the leftist, globalist bullying?
[00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:23.497]  You know, anybody that's really good, that's who they're going to fight, just like they fought Trump getting into office.
[00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:32.274]  Well, if you're a believer, as I am, that Andrew Napolitano would be a great Supreme Court justice, you should reach out for the president.
[00:52:32.814 --> 00:52:39.538]  You can call the White House switchboard, where they're set up to take messages from the American people.
[00:52:39.558 --> 00:52:41.019]  202-456-1414.
[00:52:41.039 --> 00:52:42.000]  202-456-1414.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:50.564]  Flooding the White House switchboard with supportive calls would be very helpful.
[00:52:50.904 --> 00:52:53.406]  Keep it short, keep it respectful, keep it real.
[00:52:54.162 --> 00:52:55.903]  I'm talking about manufacturing calls.
[00:52:55.923 --> 00:53:01.107]  We're talking about individual info warriors calling in to let the president know how they feel.
[00:53:02.107 --> 00:53:02.387]  That's right.
[00:53:02.407 --> 00:53:09.632]  I'm getting a jump on the leftist globalist media who is going to immediately go and dig back into the news and remember when we actually already said all this on air.
[00:53:10.132 --> 00:53:15.276]  So that's why I'm not giving out any secret information that he is the frontrunner.
[00:53:16.557 --> 00:53:19.839]  Basically, oh yeah, everything vets out, you're it, next round.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:27.464]  And I can see how the first time go with the whole computer generated, most conservative federal judge voting record.
[00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:29.825]  But he also has a very conservative record at the state level.
[00:53:31.006 --> 00:53:37.470]  And as you said, there have been many top Supreme Court justices, you name it, that were state judges.
[00:53:39.271 --> 00:53:42.513]  Yeah, that's no disqualification to say the least.
[00:53:42.633 --> 00:53:45.255]  So it would make a strong statement.
[00:53:46.132 --> 00:53:59.277]  Particularly in view of the President's recent position that he will support federal legislation to support state-legalized medical marijuana, a position that Judge Napolitano also supports.
[00:54:00.757 --> 00:54:11.201]  He is not a Bush conservative, although that's kind of a... Wouldn't you call him a nationalist, libertarian, pro-Americana populist?
[00:54:13.613 --> 00:54:21.057]  More libertarian than that, but on law and order issues, certainly he's a hardliner.
[00:54:21.978 --> 00:54:26.160]  But he's also a supporter of civil liberties, a supporter of civil rights.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.861]  So he's really a constitutionalist?
[00:54:29.002 --> 00:54:29.983]  Without any question.
[00:54:30.043 --> 00:54:31.644]  And he's a friend of this show.
[00:54:31.744 --> 00:54:35.306]  He is just a solid, solid guy.
[00:54:35.326 --> 00:54:37.787]  He'd be the best possible nominee for the president.
[00:54:38.087 --> 00:54:39.028]  Well, Trump also...
[00:54:40.503 --> 00:54:47.070]  He knows that it was Napolitano and you and I and others that first exposed the illegal spying on the president and who've been proven right over and over again.
[00:54:47.091 --> 00:54:51.315]  He knows how smart Napolitano is, not just on the law, but wide-ranging.
[00:54:51.335 --> 00:54:54.058]  I mean, I've had dinner with him many times.
[00:54:54.099 --> 00:54:55.200]  I know you're best friends with him.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.842]  He's super smart about everything.
[00:54:58.308 --> 00:55:09.381]  Well, he called that exactly right, the fact that the British were conducting surveillance on Trump so as to keep the hands clean of John Brennan and Deep State.
[00:55:09.982 --> 00:55:12.846]  He was widely derided for that at the time he said it.
[00:55:12.866 --> 00:55:16.270]  Of course, it's now been proven to be absolutely correct.
[00:55:17.807 --> 00:55:22.030]  Well, get back to your studio and let's get you on Skype to cover the incredible hearings.
[00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:23.111]  You got brought up a bunch.
[00:55:24.232 --> 00:55:30.517]  I know right off the top of my head four or five lies that Rosenstein told to Congress just in the testimony I've seen.
[00:55:30.557 --> 00:55:32.739]  It's pretty incredible, but you've got
[00:55:33.419 --> 00:55:37.261]  Trump and all these candidates he backed winning, validating him.
[00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:41.303]  You've got all these great things happening now with the Supreme Court.
[00:55:41.663 --> 00:55:44.304]  You've got the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's side this week.
[00:55:45.205 --> 00:55:46.986]  I mean, this has got to be horrifying.
[00:55:47.306 --> 00:55:49.707]  The authoritarian left right now, they're just apoplectic.
[00:55:50.868 --> 00:55:53.649]  Well, it's time for the president to fire Rosenstein.
[00:55:53.729 --> 00:55:57.191]  He has caused, as never before.
[00:55:58.595 --> 00:56:01.396]  Well, Gowdy even got off the fence and said, look, you're wrecking this country.
[00:56:01.777 --> 00:56:03.298]  This investigation is killing this country.
[00:56:03.358 --> 00:56:04.858]  Trump's not against the country.
[00:56:04.898 --> 00:56:05.559]  There's no evidence.
[00:56:05.819 --> 00:56:10.801]  If you don't have evidence to indict his ass with a grand jury right now, then I say shut it down.
[00:56:10.821 --> 00:56:13.343]  I mean, that's got to really get to him.
[00:56:15.044 --> 00:56:15.244]  All right.
[00:56:15.264 --> 00:56:18.005]  Well, I look forward to joining you by Skype shortly.
[00:56:18.886 --> 00:56:19.726]  There goes Roger Stone.
[00:56:19.766 --> 00:56:20.967]  Thank you very, very much, Roger.
[00:56:21.407 --> 00:56:22.628]  So there you got the exclusive.
[00:56:22.808 --> 00:56:24.749]  That was never in the news that
[00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:35.874]  It was in the news that he was in the running, but specifically, Trump Tower, you are going to be my next nominee.
[00:56:39.436 --> 00:56:39.616]  Boom.
[00:56:40.656 --> 00:56:46.559]  So, we'll see what happens with that, because things can change, but the President almost always does what he says he's going to do.
[00:56:46.579 --> 00:56:48.020]  I give him about a 95% accuracy rate.
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:48.941]  Hillary, about a 5%.
[00:56:50.802 --> 00:56:52.043]  So, there you go.
[00:56:52.223 --> 00:56:53.204]  Very exciting.
[00:56:53.324 --> 00:56:56.086]  Again, just because people are awake now, they're involved, they're focused.
[00:56:56.106 --> 00:56:58.408]  Okay, we got a ton of news, so much.
[00:56:58.468 --> 00:56:59.348]  I can't even get to it right now.
[00:56:59.368 --> 00:57:01.590]  It's all coming up next hour.
[00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:06.193]  Totally insane amounts of just unbelievably critical information.
[00:57:06.534 --> 00:57:10.397]  Hotep Jesus, really great, smart guy, is going to be popping in on the broadcast.
[00:57:10.817 --> 00:57:12.798]  Lionel is going to be getting in.
[00:57:12.818 --> 00:57:13.719]  He's a former prosecutor.
[00:57:14.059 --> 00:57:14.700]  He'll have a lot too.
[00:57:15.609 --> 00:57:18.190]  Please, whatever you do, spread the live video links.
[00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:20.111]  Tell folks at the local radio station you're listening to.
[00:57:21.031 --> 00:57:22.272]  Spread the articles, the videos.
[00:57:22.312 --> 00:57:23.232]  That's how we're going to win.
[00:57:23.752 --> 00:57:26.273]  Because they are really censoring the web ahead of 2018.
[00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:28.814]  Like never before, they think that's going to have them win.
[00:57:29.054 --> 00:57:30.655]  But people power can overpower them.
[00:57:30.915 --> 00:57:32.316]  We also need financial funding.
[00:57:32.336 --> 00:57:33.556]  We'll make it easy with great products.
[00:57:33.936 --> 00:57:42.260]  Our super blue, super high-quality, colloidal silver, iodine-based, fluoride-free toothpaste is available 50% off right now at InfoWaterStore.com.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.641]  33% off knockout sleep aid.
[00:57:45.661 --> 00:57:49.142]  $100 off on the air purification systems.
[00:57:49.202 --> 00:57:49.783]  It's all there.
[00:57:49.843 --> 00:57:51.003]  It makes it all possible.
[00:57:57.826 --> 00:58:03.268]  We acknowledge in this country that we can't, we cannot accept this.
[00:58:03.948 --> 00:58:04.788]  I can't do a whoop.
[00:58:04.968 --> 00:58:05.589]  I'm sorry.
[00:58:05.889 --> 00:58:06.689]  We can't do it.
[00:58:07.329 --> 00:58:07.409]  And...
[00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:17.594]  The Oscar goes to... What was your response, Phil Mudd?
[00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:19.035]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[00:58:19.335 --> 00:58:21.838]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:23.819]  Well, Trey Gowdy ought to have his a** kicked.
[00:58:26.421 --> 00:58:27.963]  I am a proud s**tholer.
[00:58:27.983 --> 00:58:29.964]  S**tholers built this country 110 years ago.
[00:58:30.084 --> 00:58:31.726]  They were called slopers and slant-eyes.
[00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:49.188]  The National Institute of Standards and Technology acknowledged that the World Trade Center Building 7 fell off freefall acceleration for over 100 feet on 9-11, which means it was meeting no resistance for eight stories.
[00:58:49.628 --> 00:58:57.172]  So, sparing me a diatribe about conspiracy theories, can you please give me a straight answer on how you think that's scientifically possible without the use of explosives?
[00:59:00.177 --> 00:59:01.837]  Look, I think we should pass on this question.
[00:59:01.857 --> 00:59:06.899]  If you want to tell me that there's something going on beyond two planes going into the buildings, I never saw anything that suggested it.
[00:59:07.319 --> 00:59:11.560]  That was the most investigated event probably in FBI investigative history.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:14.060]  I just, you know, I don't want to spend time on this question.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:14.981]  I don't think it's valid.
[00:59:28.137 --> 00:59:32.761]  When we call the Chinese man a slant-eye, when we call the man from Guatemala a spick and a wetback, THE F**K!
[00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:33.722]  And we call the black man an a*****e. OH HELL NO!
[00:59:33.742 --> 00:59:49.497]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:59:54.767 --> 01:00:00.651]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:19.628 --> 01:00:28.451]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.531 --> 01:00:43.095]  So, Trump exclusively, we just broke down last segment, told Judge Aaron Napolitano that he saw him as the leader of the pack or the person that he was intending to nominate in the second round of Supreme Court appointments.
[01:00:44.396 --> 01:00:46.016]  And we've been sitting on that for a year and a half.
[01:00:46.196 --> 01:00:47.737]  Now you've just heard it here exclusively.
[01:00:49.054 --> 01:00:53.237]  And you see the economy coming back, so many good things unfolding, so many great things that are going on.
[01:00:54.578 --> 01:00:57.901]  And the globalists just don't know what to do, so the Deep State's answer is, remove Trump!
[01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:02.084]  Before things get even better, because the public will learn that they've been artificially suppressing things.
[01:01:02.104 --> 01:01:11.031]  So I'm going to play a breakdown of this, and then come back with the powerful clips I haven't gotten to yet, of Rosenstein and the FBI director being grilled.
[01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:12.211]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:13.372 --> 01:01:15.174]  I was told that Trump would never win office.
[01:01:15.614 --> 01:01:16.815]  And I told you that was a lie.
[01:01:16.835 --> 01:01:17.936]  I told you it was fake polls.
[01:01:19.505 --> 01:01:24.746]  And then I was told over and over again he'd be removed, he'd never be seated as president, they would take the delegates.
[01:01:25.587 --> 01:01:36.609]  And then as soon as that failed, even though they'd been all over the news promoting it, they said, oh actually, we never said we were gonna keep Trump from having his delegates seated.
[01:01:36.629 --> 01:01:47.132]  And then Nancy Pelosi's daughter went on TV and called for my arrest on Fox News and made up lies about me that I threatened her.
[01:01:48.447 --> 01:01:52.130]  How do you threaten a dead dog, a rotting soulless corpse?
[01:01:53.411 --> 01:01:53.771]  You don't.
[01:01:54.291 --> 01:02:10.182]  We have the usual suspects, two different former CIA directors, coming out over the weekend and saying, we're going to call for the 25th Amendment to be implemented to unseat the president for dereliction of duty and incompetence and mental illness.
[01:02:11.323 --> 01:02:17.828]  The mentally ill person that never ran for office and beat you and then turned the economy around and did all this and got peace deals, right?
[01:02:18.988 --> 01:02:20.129]  There's the article from The Hill.
[01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:26.433]  Ex-CIA chief calls on White House cabinet to revolt against Trump and remove him from office.
[01:02:28.274 --> 01:02:32.017]  Insurrection by GOP leadership inner circle necessary to stop President, he says.
[01:02:32.077 --> 01:02:32.557]  And who is he?
[01:02:33.118 --> 01:02:37.981]  He's the Wahhabist Brennanite who in college admitted he was part of the Communist Party.
[01:02:38.902 --> 01:02:41.363]  The CIA said, well my God, let's put you at the top.
[01:02:42.164 --> 01:02:44.646]  He's got Clapper behind him calling for the same garbage.
[01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.937]  And other former CIA directors as well.
[01:02:51.699 --> 01:02:55.461]  And they want the 25th Amendment implemented to remove him from office.
[01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.942]  And they want it done now, postage.
[01:02:58.762 --> 01:03:00.903]  They want it done as soon as possible.
[01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:01.704]  But here's the thing.
[01:03:02.384 --> 01:03:03.585]  They've been pushing this.
[01:03:04.355 --> 01:03:07.077]  So the FBI people, I'm going to tell you, are ticked.
[01:03:07.578 --> 01:03:13.463]  And they're going to be saying, I guarantee it, you think you can push us off this because you can try to intimidate the director?
[01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.565]  You better think again, Mr. President.
[01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.146]  You've been around for 13 months.
[01:03:17.206 --> 01:03:17.987]  We've been around since 1908.
[01:03:18.107 --> 01:03:21.289]  I know how this game is going to be played.
[01:03:21.369 --> 01:03:22.090]  We're going to win.
[01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:26.033]  I'm reading it in the Financial Times of London, New Yorker Magazine, New York Times.
[01:03:26.954 --> 01:03:27.795]  Atlantic Monthly.
[01:03:28.695 --> 01:03:30.336]  These are establishment publications.
[01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:31.897]  They're like, we're ending the family.
[01:03:32.537 --> 01:03:34.778]  We're going to savage the US.
[01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:37.180]  China has 97% of the rare earth minerals.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.340]  The US will never come back.
[01:03:39.161 --> 01:03:42.763]  Lloyd Blankfein, before he got kicked out of Goldman Sachs, is like, I was just at China.
[01:03:42.923 --> 01:03:44.764]  They've got 10 times the infrastructure of Trump.
[01:03:44.944 --> 01:03:46.345]  You'll never bring America back.
[01:03:46.725 --> 01:03:47.405]  These are tweets.
[01:03:48.026 --> 01:03:52.368]  They're like, God, these people like breathlessly, we'll get you people.
[01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:53.809]  And it's like, what did we do to you?
[01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:57.338]  But America's the big enchilada.
[01:03:57.438 --> 01:03:58.979]  It had half the wealth in 1955.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.302]  So they parlayed it into global corporate power.
[01:04:02.862 --> 01:04:05.925]  So if you're going to screw America over, why not get in a culture of hating it?
[01:04:07.866 --> 01:04:09.607]  They're not like, well, we're bleeding the country dry.
[01:04:09.627 --> 01:04:13.210]  It was a great, beautiful lady, but we're sacrificing her for our global power.
[01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:16.893]  No, they're too big of cowards to admit they're doing it.
[01:04:16.973 --> 01:04:18.294]  So they decide to hate it.
[01:04:20.215 --> 01:04:21.816]  And that's what I want you to understand.
[01:04:22.177 --> 01:04:23.738]  Trump doesn't hate America.
[01:04:25.382 --> 01:04:30.265]  And so, he's like, you see these speeches, and these are real numbers, you've seen them, they don't even debate these.
[01:04:30.285 --> 01:04:36.709]  He's like, Canada has a 270% dairy tax, and we have zero?
[01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.092]  Trump goes, okay, I'll put 100% on them.
[01:04:40.612 --> 01:04:43.554]  And they go, oh my god, you backward, hateful person!
[01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:44.414]  He's like, wait, you got a 270!
[01:04:48.139 --> 01:04:56.847]  270!
[01:04:48.179 --> 01:04:56.847]  I mean, if anything, Trump's being too soft, but he knows he could destabilize things, so he's just like, hey, China, you got a $900 billion trade deficit, we'll do $50 billion.
[01:04:56.867 --> 01:05:00.030]  Just pay it, and promise to start taking some of our cars, and I'll leave you alone.
[01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:01.332]  And China goes.
[01:05:04.246 --> 01:05:09.508]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.

[01:06:21.439 --> 01:06:22.580]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:27.843]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.464 --> 01:06:30.564]  In 2004,
[01:06:38.132 --> 01:06:46.156]  Al Gore said that by 2016, the entire northern ice sheet would be gone in winter and summer.
[01:06:47.877 --> 01:06:50.158]  Well, we're in the summer right now.
[01:06:50.178 --> 01:06:53.360]  We're going to show you the satellite images and everything coming up.
[01:06:54.501 --> 01:06:59.163]  Arctic Ocean, almost totally ice covered.
[01:07:00.703 --> 01:07:04.805]  In fact, it's the highest level of ice ever recorded in the summertime.
[01:07:05.705 --> 01:07:09.027]  And during the winter, the Northern Passage is completely open.
[01:07:12.249 --> 01:07:15.030]  Just everything these liars put out is total horse manure.
[01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:16.771]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[01:07:19.712 --> 01:07:25.275]  And I remember back when Al Gore and Hillary and all them were saying that they were buying 20 million, 40 million dollar houses, remember?
[01:07:25.895 --> 01:07:29.117]  Right on the beach in Malibu and stuff.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:37.683]  And they were saying, they'll be, you know, water flooding inland, and we're all gonna die!
[01:07:39.164 --> 01:07:41.506]  Total horseman-er.
[01:07:42.987 --> 01:07:43.547]  That's coming up.
[01:07:45.408 --> 01:07:52.012]  But oh my gosh, Dan Rather, they've had him crawl out of the grave to... And don't say crawl out of the grave because he's old.
[01:07:52.072 --> 01:07:58.136]  Trump's like alive and vibrant, like a... golden toad baby or something.
[01:07:58.396 --> 01:07:59.077]  But then you've got...
[01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:12.264]  Rather, the old fake newsman climbing out of his hole, saying that, in fact, let's cue it up, that Trump is like a mean wolverine.
[01:08:18.467 --> 01:08:22.550]  No, you're the mean wolverines trying to destroy the country, but he'll stand up to you and fight you.
[01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:25.071]  Mean as a wolverine.
[01:08:31.291 --> 01:08:31.671]  Here it is.
[01:08:52.072 --> 01:09:07.315]  And part of the reason is that whether he is or is not inside himself, that President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do, that he's mean as a wolverine.
[01:09:08.016 --> 01:09:11.136]  And we've never had a president who had that reputation.
[01:09:11.156 --> 01:09:17.818]  We had reputations of presidents who were not very good, presidents who broke the law, in the case of President Nixon.
[01:09:18.658 --> 01:09:24.263]  We've never had something like, never had a crazed, evil, Chi-Com owned media trying to destroy the country and the family.
[01:09:24.764 --> 01:09:26.345]  And then somebody stands up to you and you can't stand it.
[01:09:26.365 --> 01:09:31.090]  You go, quit being mean, quit being mean when you're all calling us all Nazis and saying attack our families.
[01:09:32.071 --> 01:09:34.153]  And then you're on Soros the Nazis payroll.
[01:09:35.194 --> 01:09:36.215]  You're a joke, rather.
[01:09:36.695 --> 01:09:39.077]  You and Don Lemon ought to crawl in the same grave together.
[01:09:40.299 --> 01:09:41.119]  Alright, politically.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:42.581]  Not physically, obviously.
[01:09:43.322 --> 01:09:44.803]  The worms would think you tasted terrible.
[01:09:45.164 --> 01:09:48.166]  Let's go ahead and go to Jim Jordan today, grilling Rosenstein.
[01:09:48.186 --> 01:09:48.566]  Here it is.
[01:09:49.307 --> 01:09:51.509]  I recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan.
[01:09:51.629 --> 01:09:52.210]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.892]  Mr. Rosenstein, why are you keeping information from Congress?
[01:09:57.054 --> 01:10:04.180]  Congressman, I am not keeping any information from Congress that it's appropriate... In a few minutes, Mr. Rosenstein, I think the House of Representatives is going to say something different.
[01:10:04.574 --> 01:10:05.815]  I don't agree with you, Congressman.
[01:10:05.915 --> 01:10:08.836]  I don't believe that's what they're going to say, and if they do, they'll be mistaken.
[01:10:08.876 --> 01:10:22.862]  I disagree, but I think in a few minutes, the House of Representatives is going to go on record saying you haven't complied with requests from a separate and equal branch of government, that you haven't complied with subpoenas, and you've got seven days to get your act together.
[01:10:22.922 --> 01:10:24.743]  I think that's what's going to happen in a few days.
[01:10:24.783 --> 01:10:25.903]  That's not Jim Jordan.
[01:10:26.563 --> 01:10:28.784]  I think that's the majority of the House of Representatives.
[01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:30.565]  In just a few minutes, I think that's going to happen.
[01:10:30.825 --> 01:10:32.806]  And I want to know why you won't give us what we've asked for.
[01:10:33.186 --> 01:10:36.068]  Sir, I certainly hope that your colleagues are not under that impression.
[01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:38.791]  That is not accurate, sir.
[01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:39.471]  It is accurate.
[01:10:39.511 --> 01:10:41.253]  We have caught you hiding information, Mr. Rosenstein.
[01:10:41.293 --> 01:10:42.494]  Mr. Chairman, we allow the witness to answer.
[01:10:42.634 --> 01:10:43.655]  Mr. Chairman, point of order.
[01:10:43.995 --> 01:10:47.358]  We can go to Mr. Jordan's press conference and listen to him, but we came here to hear from the witness.
[01:10:47.378 --> 01:10:49.279]  The time belongs to the gentleman.
[01:10:49.319 --> 01:10:50.080]  Mr. Rosenstein.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:50.841]  We allow him to answer?
[01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:52.342]  We have caught you hiding information.
[01:10:52.362 --> 01:10:53.523]  Mr. Chairman, we allow him to answer.
[01:10:53.843 --> 01:10:59.265]  He will be permitted to answer when Mr. Jordan is here, and we'll allow him additional time to answer.
[01:10:59.706 --> 01:11:00.706]  Why are they not allowed to answer?
[01:11:00.726 --> 01:11:01.646]  The gentleman's out of order.
[01:11:01.706 --> 01:11:03.527]  The gentleman from Ohio is recognized.
[01:11:03.547 --> 01:11:04.988]  Mr. Rose, let me make this one point, then I'll let you answer.
[01:11:05.008 --> 01:11:05.268]  Yes, Mr. Jordan.
[01:11:05.288 --> 01:11:06.068]  I'd like to answer your question, sir.
[01:11:06.088 --> 01:11:09.110]  Let me make this one point where we've caught you hiding information, then you can answer.
[01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:13.071]  Why did you hide the fact that Peter Strzok and Judge Contreras were friends?
[01:11:13.131 --> 01:11:15.152]  Why did you redact that in the documents you gave to us?
[01:11:15.452 --> 01:11:17.453]  Peter, I mean, Judge Contreras is kind of important.
[01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:18.854]  If I was a court judge, more importantly,
[01:11:19.554 --> 01:11:23.839]  Just as importantly, the judge that heard Mike Flynn's case, why'd you try to hide that from us?
[01:11:23.959 --> 01:11:26.422]  Mr. Jordan, I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to respond.
[01:11:26.943 --> 01:11:29.926]  I've heard you make those sort of allegations publicly on TV.
[01:11:30.347 --> 01:11:31.708]  I got them right here.
[01:11:31.868 --> 01:11:35.032]  Mr. Chairman, he should be given the opportunity to answer.
[01:11:36.574 --> 01:11:39.157]  I am the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.
[01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.410]  He!
[01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.371]  Yeah, Bull!
[01:11:41.391 --> 01:11:42.852]  You ran the whole stinkin' thing, Crook!
[01:11:42.872 --> 01:11:44.353]  That's why they put you in there!
[01:11:44.393 --> 01:11:45.054]  Just like McCain!
[01:11:45.074 --> 01:11:45.174]  Bull!
[01:11:45.194 --> 01:11:46.355]  You're the boss, Mr. Rosenstein.
[01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:46.715]  That's correct!
[01:11:46.755 --> 01:11:47.176]  Hit pause!
[01:12:04.568 --> 01:12:10.210]  Mr. Rosenstein is on record for months, for six months, not releasing the documents.
[01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:11.831]  And when he does, it's only part of it.
[01:12:12.311 --> 01:12:14.052]  He goes, he doesn't know where the other stuff is.
[01:12:14.452 --> 01:12:16.993]  He just said, why aren't you giving us the information under the law?
[01:12:17.013 --> 01:12:17.733]  We're supposed to get it.
[01:12:17.753 --> 01:12:18.994]  And he's saying, I haven't.
[01:12:19.174 --> 01:12:22.975]  He's lying to us like he thinks he's God and we're an animal.
[01:12:25.856 --> 01:12:27.457]  Let's go back to this little piece of crap.
[01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:31.367]  And my job is to make sure that we respond to your concerns.
[01:12:31.407 --> 01:12:32.048]  We have, sir.
[01:12:32.328 --> 01:12:35.190]  Now, I've appointed Mr. Lausch, who is managing that production.
[01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:37.992]  And my understanding is it's actually going very well, sir.
[01:12:38.012 --> 01:12:39.954]  So, I appreciate your concerns.
[01:12:39.974 --> 01:12:42.216]  Again, I think the House of Representatives is going to say otherwise.
[01:12:42.436 --> 01:12:45.398]  But your use of this to attack me personally is deeply wrong.
[01:12:45.418 --> 01:12:46.479]  Point of order, Mr. Chairman.
[01:12:46.499 --> 01:12:48.281]  May the witness be permitted to answer the question personally?
[01:12:48.321 --> 01:12:49.081]  It's not personal.
[01:12:49.181 --> 01:12:50.142]  The gentleman will suspend.
[01:12:50.242 --> 01:12:54.446]  The witness is going to have an opportunity to say whatever he wants at the end of Mr. Jordan's five minutes.
[01:12:54.486 --> 01:12:58.129]  Until the end of those five minutes... By the way, ABC News is reporting...
[01:12:59.049 --> 01:12:59.549]  Pause real quick.
[01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:03.411]  ABC News is now reporting that they're moving for impeachment of Rosenstein.
[01:13:05.091 --> 01:13:11.553]  Man, I tell you, everybody knows America's coming back and the cabals that have sold this country out, you are in trouble.
[01:13:13.234 --> 01:13:15.855]  House Republicans just escalated their war with the Justice Department.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.984]  Voting to point out that Rosenstein has refused to release the documents.
[01:13:23.384 --> 01:13:25.086]  Just as you heard Jordan saying they would.
[01:13:25.967 --> 01:13:28.189]  And now they're moving towards his impeachment.
[01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:31.932]  That means that Congress is removing him, not the President!
[01:13:32.473 --> 01:13:33.234]  Ha ha ha!
[01:13:33.654 --> 01:13:36.216]  If the President won't do it, Congress will!
[01:13:36.737 --> 01:13:38.098]  Ha ha ha!
[01:13:38.439 --> 01:13:41.481]  More than one way to skin a cat, isn't there, Mr. Rosenstein?
[01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:42.863]  Alright, let's go back to him.
[01:13:44.136 --> 01:13:46.819]  Why did you tell Peter Strzok not to answer our questions yesterday?
[01:13:47.319 --> 01:13:54.448]  When I asked Peter Strzok if he'd ever communicated with Glenn Simpson, he gave us the answer he gave us dozens of times.
[01:13:54.568 --> 01:13:56.951]  On advice of FBI counsel, I can't answer that question.
[01:13:56.991 --> 01:13:58.133]  Why couldn't he answer that question?
[01:13:58.697 --> 01:14:03.220]  Mr. Jordan, I appreciate your sincere concerns, but I didn't give Peter Strzok any instructions.
[01:14:03.761 --> 01:14:09.065]  If there was some problem with the instructions he had, I'll be happy to look into it.
[01:14:10.066 --> 01:14:15.850]  When you find some problem with a production or with questions, it doesn't mean that I'm personally trying to conceal something from you.
[01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:19.012]  It means we're running an organization that's trying to follow the rules.
[01:14:19.032 --> 01:14:23.256]  It's interesting when I asked him if he'd ever talked to Bruce or he said he had.
[01:14:24.016 --> 01:14:25.877]  Said he had three times in 2016 and 2017.
[01:14:25.977 --> 01:14:29.119]  Then I asked him, have you ever talked to Nellie Orr?
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.600]  And he said, no, I haven't.
[01:14:31.141 --> 01:14:33.002]  I said, well, why can't you answer that question?
[01:14:33.042 --> 01:14:35.884]  Because Nellie Orr worked for Glenn Simpson, worked for Fusion.
[01:14:36.124 --> 01:14:39.907]  He could answer that question, but he couldn't answer because the FBI counsel told him he couldn't.
[01:14:40.207 --> 01:14:44.670]  He couldn't answer the question whether he'd ever communicated with Glenn Simpson, a journalist.
[01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:46.931]  And of course, then it gets to the questions.
[01:14:46.951 --> 01:14:48.052]  When we come back, I'm going to play more.
[01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:49.553]  Who is it?
[01:14:51.155 --> 01:14:53.396]  On the fake FISA warrants names you won't release.
[01:14:53.717 --> 01:14:55.778]  Who is it that directed you to do the investigation?
[01:14:56.218 --> 01:14:57.359]  Who is it you're covering for?
[01:14:57.419 --> 01:15:02.061]  And we know the name... Loretta Lynch.
[01:15:04.302 --> 01:15:04.563]  Oh yeah.
[01:15:05.623 --> 01:15:08.665]  And then... Who gave Loretta Lynch the order?
[01:15:10.426 --> 01:15:17.810]  Barack... Hussein... Long-legged... Mac Daddy... Obama.
[01:15:19.295 --> 01:15:25.281]  For Hillary, in a political campaign, to stop Trump being elected, and then to try to get him removed.
[01:15:25.762 --> 01:15:31.287]  You talk about criminal, racketeering, treason against the voters, the people, the providence of the U.S.
[01:15:31.388 --> 01:15:33.850]  You guys are in deep doo-doo, as they say.
[01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:37.414]  Going back to the subject when we returned.
[01:15:38.996 --> 01:15:41.238]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:15:41.359 --> 01:15:43.981]  Tomorrow's news today, the destiny of freedom.
[01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:55.373]  If you take it in your hands, and if you take the information and you move it forward, don't forget, we have 50% off on our entire line of Super Blue, chloride-free, colloidal silver, iodide-fortified toothpaste.
[01:15:55.654 --> 01:15:56.535]  That supports the broadcast.
[01:15:56.555 --> 01:15:57.436]  Take advantage of the specials.
[01:15:57.476 --> 01:15:58.397]  They have to end soon.
[01:16:09.582 --> 01:16:10.722]  Dr. Shiva's our guest.
[01:16:11.142 --> 01:16:12.383]  Great guy running for Senate.
[01:16:12.703 --> 01:16:13.603]  Got a shot at winning.
[01:16:13.623 --> 01:16:16.124]  And Elizabeth Warren, really a smart engineer.
[01:16:16.384 --> 01:16:17.424]  Very successful businessman.
[01:16:17.744 --> 01:16:18.484]  Inventor of email.
[01:16:18.544 --> 01:16:18.905]  Look it up.
[01:16:18.985 --> 01:16:19.425]  It's true.
[01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:28.867]  And he is running against Elizabeth Warren, who will not do the genetic test, who the tribes say she has no connection to in Oklahoma or other areas.
[01:16:28.947 --> 01:16:31.908]  But he's a real Indian from the subcontinent, India.
[01:16:31.948 --> 01:16:32.848]  But he's a great patron.
[01:16:32.868 --> 01:16:33.709]  I'd love to get him in the U.S.
[01:16:33.749 --> 01:16:34.029]  Senate.
[01:16:34.069 --> 01:16:38.830]  Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, thanks for joining us with some big, breaking, exclusive news.
[01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:43.512]  You know, we got this big sign out here, you may see it, you know, only the real Indian can defeat the fake Indian.
[01:16:43.812 --> 01:17:00.041]  It's a very powerful meme, Alex, and I want to really explain why it's so powerful and why we put it out there, because it really is an expression of not only my anger, but pretty much everyone's anger at the corruption that is taking place in government, and Elizabeth Warren is the face of that corruption.
[01:17:00.061 --> 01:17:07.965]  So when we put that signage up on our bus, the city of Cambridge, which is supposed to be the most liberal haven on the planet, said we had to take it down.
[01:17:08.905 --> 01:17:10.946]  That was on April 5th, 2018.
[01:17:10.986 --> 01:17:11.667]  We didn't do that.
[01:17:11.707 --> 01:17:16.289]  In fact, we retaliated hard and we sued them, took them to federal court, and we won.
[01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:19.830]  They surrendered completely.
[01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.792]  And, you know, then based on that, we dismissed the court case.
[01:17:23.852 --> 01:17:26.833]  Obviously, the mainstream media did not want to cover our victory.
[01:17:27.354 --> 01:17:29.975]  So what we realized, Alex, the big news is this.
[01:17:30.515 --> 01:17:32.376]  And this is something that's really, really important.
[01:17:32.396 --> 01:17:37.058]  You see, for far too long, the establishment has made politics
[01:17:37.758 --> 01:17:41.402]  A, uh, essentially a, uh, you know, an audience sport, right?
[01:17:41.702 --> 01:17:45.786]  They do not want the everyday citizen to actually be involved in that aspect.
[01:17:45.806 --> 01:17:48.328]  They want to make it the old Hollywood celebrity culture.
[01:17:48.368 --> 01:17:52.672]  You put a couple of people on pedestals and we're supposed to watch them and eat our popcorn.
[01:17:52.712 --> 01:17:56.976]  So what we've done here, Alex, is that's becoming really powerful is we've figured out the victory to winning.
[01:17:57.116 --> 01:18:06.059]  And what we realized was people say, you know what, you guys have a lot of courage to put that out there because you're bringing out something in Massachusetts that people do not want to talk about.
[01:18:06.139 --> 01:18:08.380]  It's a weaponized way of getting across our message.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.541]  So what we've done is if you see these magnetic signs here, they're really easy.
[01:18:12.902 --> 01:18:16.603]  So we want to replicate this all over the state, Alex.
[01:18:16.663 --> 01:18:17.723]  In fact, all over the country.
[01:18:18.243 --> 01:18:20.404]  And basically people can buy these magnetic signs.
[01:18:20.424 --> 01:18:22.205]  You can see as you're showing being put on.
[01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:28.048]  And where, since we launched it, we have, you know, tons of people starting to write and wanting these.
[01:18:28.108 --> 01:18:29.129]  And why is that?
[01:18:29.649 --> 01:18:33.351]  And the reality is when Elizabeth Warren, it's not about identity, right?
[01:18:33.371 --> 01:18:36.873]  The liberals want to convert it to a race issue, but it's nothing to do with race.
[01:18:36.933 --> 01:18:38.794]  It has to do with integrity.
[01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:42.376]  We're talking about someone who did not work hard, who cut in line.
[01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:46.719]  You, me, Alex, and pretty much every American watching your show works for a living.
[01:18:46.739 --> 01:18:48.500]  You know, I mowed lawns as a kid.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.744]  You know, I learned to engineer software as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid.
[01:18:53.044 --> 01:18:54.285]  I've been working all my life.
[01:18:54.585 --> 01:18:57.909]  But Elizabeth Warren cut in front of line, and they do not want to discuss that.
[01:18:57.969 --> 01:19:03.534]  So we are bringing up not just a race issue, because for far too long down the street is Harvard University.
[01:19:04.074 --> 01:19:11.656]  The white liberal racists who want us to keep us all on their reservation and plantation have bounded the discussion of race, Alex.
[01:19:11.716 --> 01:19:12.976]  And they don't know what to do with us.
[01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:16.276]  Because when we bring up that sign, they'll say, oh, that's racist.
[01:19:16.316 --> 01:19:17.057]  We'll say, really?
[01:19:17.417 --> 01:19:24.398]  And we'll flip it back and we say, look, you're the racist because you're supporting a woman who took advantage of race to get in and when she's not of that race.
[01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:28.939]  How do folks, even though they're not in Massachusetts, how do they get one of these babies?
[01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:29.699]  It's very easy.
[01:19:29.719 --> 01:19:31.461]  You just go to shiva4senate.com.
[01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:32.681]  You can find it right there.
[01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:34.082]  It's called a Road Warrior Kit.
[01:19:34.122 --> 01:19:34.883]  Go to the store.
[01:19:35.243 --> 01:19:36.424]  Get the Road Warrior Kit.
[01:19:36.464 --> 01:19:36.964]  We've made it.
[01:19:37.204 --> 01:19:38.485]  You get two magnetic stickers.
[01:19:38.505 --> 01:19:39.306]  You get a lawn sign.
[01:19:39.326 --> 01:19:40.367]  You get two bumper stickers.
[01:19:40.947 --> 01:19:41.267]  Oh my god.
[01:19:41.287 --> 01:19:43.309]  You gotta call this Operation Road Warrior.
[01:19:43.329 --> 01:19:44.069]  Is that what you're calling it?
[01:19:44.109 --> 01:19:44.649]  That's what I call it.
[01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:45.790]  It's called Road Warrior.
[01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:47.111]  Be a Road Warrior.
[01:19:47.371 --> 01:19:48.572]  That's getting back.
[01:19:49.052 --> 01:19:52.695]  So if you can't come to and pass out cards, you can't do anything.
[01:19:52.715 --> 01:19:53.535]  You know, you got family.
[01:19:53.735 --> 01:19:55.216]  Hey, I'm fully supporting this.
[01:19:55.697 --> 01:19:56.677]  But I am stealing the idea.
[01:19:56.697 --> 01:19:58.579]  We're gonna launch Operation Road Warrior with our stuff too.
[01:20:06.353 --> 01:20:08.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:35.037]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting on over 260 radio stations, over 400 TV stations, over 70 cable stations, and simulcast on the internet in every format we can find.
[01:20:35.477 --> 01:20:40.699]  From message in a bottle to global satellite transmission, this is the InfoWar.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:48.163]  I am Alex Jones, commissioned by duty and justice, and then recommissioned by the President
[01:20:49.178 --> 01:21:02.614]  To take action against the globalists and to cover the topics others won't, to tell the savage truths, to break the ice, to blast through the enemy's defenses, to make it safe for others to come out with the hard truths.
[01:21:03.715 --> 01:21:04.096]  We're here.
[01:21:04.256 --> 01:21:04.797]  Tip of the spear.
[01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:06.968]  The tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.388 --> 01:21:08.269]  Many claim to be it.
[01:21:08.449 --> 01:21:10.530]  This is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:12.872]  Recognized enemy of the globalists.
[01:21:13.252 --> 01:21:19.517]  And that is not a happy time, happy making time, like George Soros talked about on 60 Minutes Rounding Up Jews.
[01:21:19.537 --> 01:21:20.517]  It was happy making time.
[01:21:20.797 --> 01:21:21.398]  Exhilarating.
[01:21:21.458 --> 01:21:22.258]  Best time of my life.
[01:21:23.339 --> 01:21:23.880]  Those are quotes.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.641]  This is not happy making for us.
[01:21:25.661 --> 01:21:26.401]  This is duty.
[01:21:27.162 --> 01:21:33.747]  But I gotta tell you, all we've been through to begin to see the worm turn, to begin to see victory, it's just there's a God above.
[01:21:34.147 --> 01:21:35.608]  And it doesn't mean we're offering some utopia.
[01:21:36.636 --> 01:21:54.500]  Justin, what Lord Acton said, and what Thomas Jefferson said, and what many other famous historians said in different ways, that all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:59.701]  And that's what this comes down to right now.
[01:22:02.244 --> 01:22:06.371]  It's another British historian that said it almost the same, but many of these truths have been quoted different ways.
[01:22:06.811 --> 01:22:07.172]  We're here.
[01:22:07.733 --> 01:22:14.944]  So Jim Jordan's really on fire, tearing in to Rosenstein, catching him in all these lines.
[01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:17.050]  And catching him in cover-ups.
[01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:19.891]  And Rosenstein's saying, I'm not blocking any documents.
[01:22:19.911 --> 01:22:21.232]  Well, the House just voted.
[01:22:21.952 --> 01:22:22.952]  Jim Jordan said they were.
[01:22:22.992 --> 01:22:23.733]  He knew the vote time.
[01:22:23.953 --> 01:22:24.713]  Put it back on screen.
[01:22:25.053 --> 01:22:27.154]  So I guess Jordan couldn't leave for the grilling to even go vote.
[01:22:27.494 --> 01:22:28.114]  Let's put it on screen.
[01:22:28.374 --> 01:22:34.556]  They voted that they are suppressing it, that they are going to compel him, that they're going to move with impeachment.
[01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:35.616]  Go ahead and scroll down.
[01:22:35.656 --> 01:22:36.337]  We've got the quote there.
[01:22:36.357 --> 01:22:36.977]  I read it during the break.
[01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:43.539]  So now it's their final warning before they nail him to the wall.
[01:22:44.674 --> 01:22:46.395]  226 votes, 183.
[01:22:48.717 --> 01:22:57.323]  Now on Thursday, the battle escalated with a vote by the full House of Representatives on a resolution to insist DOJ comply with the House subpoenas and other document requests.
[01:22:57.803 --> 01:23:01.626]  By July 6, the resolution passed on party lines.
[01:23:03.067 --> 01:23:09.892]  Let's go ahead now, ladies and gentlemen, and go back to Jim Jordan grilling Rosenstein and catching him in a bunch of whoppers.
[01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:15.272]  He couldn't answer the question whether you'd ever communicated with Glenn Simpson, a journalist.
[01:23:16.553 --> 01:23:17.614]  Why couldn't he answer that question?
[01:23:17.634 --> 01:23:19.575]  Mr. Jordan, I appreciate you saying it isn't personal.
[01:23:19.615 --> 01:23:20.696]  Sometimes it feels that way.
[01:23:21.397 --> 01:23:22.397]  How do I know, sir?
[01:23:22.557 --> 01:23:24.079]  I mean, you interviewed Mr. Strzok.
[01:23:24.139 --> 01:23:24.499]  I didn't.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.020]  So I can't answer.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.582]  Works for you.
[01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:28.342]  Doesn't work for us.
[01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:31.465]  There are 115,000 people who work for me, sir.
[01:23:32.265 --> 01:23:36.589]  Mr. Rosenstein, did you threaten staffers on the House Intelligence Committee?
[01:23:37.469 --> 01:23:38.911]  Media reports indicate you did.
[01:23:39.585 --> 01:23:40.746]  Media reports are mistaken.
[01:23:41.086 --> 01:23:41.626]  Sometimes.
[01:23:42.367 --> 01:23:43.488]  But this is what they said.
[01:23:43.748 --> 01:23:50.212]  Having the nation's number one law enforcement officer threaten to subpoena your calls and emails is downright chilling.
[01:23:50.412 --> 01:23:52.494]  Did you threaten to subpoena their calls and emails?
[01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:54.575]  No, sir, and there's no way to subpoena phone calls.
[01:23:55.376 --> 01:23:55.636]  What?!
[01:23:55.856 --> 01:23:58.858]  Well, I mean, I'm just saying.
[01:23:58.878 --> 01:24:00.659]  That's total crap.
[01:24:01.219 --> 01:24:03.801]  You just play a little game there, like I'm the legal genius and you're not.
[01:24:06.003 --> 01:24:08.925]  They threatened to go and grab their records with the subpoena.
[01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:14.065]  To make them appear in court with the information demanded.
[01:24:14.565 --> 01:24:17.590]  Believe me, I've had enough lawsuits and divorce and custody battles.
[01:24:18.171 --> 01:24:19.814]  You get subpoenaed to show up in court.
[01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:24.047]  And you get ordered by the court to produce your records.
[01:24:24.107 --> 01:24:24.927]  It's called discovery.
[01:24:25.207 --> 01:24:30.048]  But that little piece of crap, like Hillary, when they went, you transferred the weapons to Turkey to start the invasion.
[01:24:30.509 --> 01:24:34.110]  You transferred the weapons to Turkey to go into Syria.
[01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:35.230]  She goes, Turkey?
[01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:36.771]  What's a turkey, a bird?
[01:24:37.251 --> 01:24:39.731]  Thinking viewers don't know there's a country called Turkey.
[01:24:41.492 --> 01:24:41.892]  Continue.
[01:24:43.092 --> 01:24:44.033]  Subpoena phone calls.
[01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:46.153]  Well, I mean, I'm just saying.
[01:24:47.854 --> 01:24:48.934]  I'm reading what the press said.
[01:24:49.034 --> 01:24:51.475]  By the way, they do subpoena phone records.
[01:24:53.615 --> 01:24:54.976]  I've had my phone record subpoenaed!
[01:24:55.817 --> 01:24:56.418]  Four times!
[01:24:58.079 --> 01:24:58.980]  God Almighty!
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.804]  I mean, you talk about... Oh, man, wow!
[01:25:04.445 --> 01:25:06.226]  And all the scum they've got in there laughing.
[01:25:06.927 --> 01:25:08.168]  Keep laughing, jerks!
[01:25:08.408 --> 01:25:09.229]  You keep laughing!
[01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:10.210]  Go back to it.
[01:25:11.511 --> 01:25:12.392]  I'm reading what the press said.
[01:25:12.412 --> 01:25:13.252]  I'm reading what the press said.
[01:25:13.312 --> 01:25:15.714]  I would suggest that you not rely on what the press says, sir.
[01:25:15.755 --> 01:25:17.036]  Well, I didn't ask if there's no way to do it.
[01:25:17.056 --> 01:25:17.916]  I asked if you said it.
[01:25:17.936 --> 01:25:19.338]  If I said what?
[01:25:19.943 --> 01:25:20.844]  What I just read you!
[01:25:20.864 --> 01:25:21.324]  No, I did not.
[01:25:22.045 --> 01:25:23.366]  Well, now, who are we supposed to believe?
[01:25:23.766 --> 01:25:32.452]  Staff members who we've worked with, who've never misled us, or you guys, who we've caught hiding information from us, who tell a witness not to answer our questions?
[01:25:32.832 --> 01:25:33.733]  Who are we supposed to believe?
[01:25:33.933 --> 01:25:37.336]  Thank you for making clear it's not personal, Mr. Jordan.
[01:25:37.996 --> 01:25:38.176]  See?
[01:25:38.677 --> 01:25:41.259]  He's threatening their staff, he's threatening other people.
[01:25:41.339 --> 01:25:41.999]  It's on record.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.522]  These guys are a bunch of thug gangsters.
[01:25:46.732 --> 01:25:50.113]  Who have asked hundreds of people about me, like that intimidates me, you little thug!
[01:25:51.374 --> 01:25:53.115]  America's awake, Rosenstein!
[01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:53.635]  Get it!
[01:25:55.255 --> 01:25:55.776]  Let's go back to it.
[01:25:55.796 --> 01:25:59.377]  I'm saying the Department of Justice... You shouldn't leave me because I'm telling the truth and I'm under oath.
[01:25:59.897 --> 01:26:04.759]  If you want to put somebody else under oath and they have something different... I know these staff members!
[01:26:04.919 --> 01:26:05.900]  Here's my last question.
[01:26:07.864 --> 01:26:17.730]  What's so important that you know, that you don't want us to know, that you won't give us the documents we're asking for, that the House of Representatives is about ready to go on record saying you should give us?
[01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:22.353]  What's so darn important that you will threaten members, at least according to me, according to the staff members, threaten members?
[01:26:22.373 --> 01:26:24.054]  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
[01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:26.135]  What is so important, Mr. Rosenstein?
[01:26:26.155 --> 01:26:27.616]  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
[01:26:29.177 --> 01:26:31.498]  This is not an appropriate time for a parliamentary inquiry.
[01:26:31.518 --> 01:26:32.279]  And point of order.
[01:26:33.147 --> 01:26:35.651]  The gentleman keeps representing the House of Representatives.
[01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:36.412]  Yes, it will be.
[01:26:36.472 --> 01:26:40.397]  The Republicans who continue to... That is not an appropriate point of order.
[01:26:40.477 --> 01:26:42.640]  Well, he needs to be corrected in his statement.
[01:26:43.061 --> 01:26:46.426]  The time of the gentleman... He will be the members of the Republican Party.
[01:26:46.446 --> 01:26:47.667]  The gentleman will suspend.
[01:26:48.581 --> 01:26:56.589]  The time of the gentleman from Ohio will be restored for an additional 15 seconds, and then the Deputy Attorney General will be allowed to respond.
[01:26:56.649 --> 01:26:57.270]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:04.777]  Mr. Rothstein, Mr. Wray, I do appreciate work, but I'd also appreciate if the House of Representatives could get the information.
[01:27:04.877 --> 01:27:06.019]  We have repeatedly
[01:27:06.539 --> 01:27:10.160]  Mr. Gowdy talked about how long this investigation is going on, how long there's been a special counsel.
[01:27:10.401 --> 01:27:13.562]  We started asking for information in July of last year.
[01:27:13.982 --> 01:27:17.463]  And some of that is still not given, still has not been given to the Congress.
[01:27:17.723 --> 01:27:21.765]  Still has not been given to this committee, the committee charged with defending the Judiciary Committee.
[01:27:22.025 --> 01:27:23.366]  So, I appreciate what you do.
[01:27:23.686 --> 01:27:24.726]  I just want the information.
[01:27:24.786 --> 01:27:29.528]  And we're so frustrated that there is now a resolution on the floor of the House in just a few minutes that will be voted on.
[01:27:29.748 --> 01:27:31.069]  The time of the gentleman has expired.
[01:27:31.089 --> 01:27:33.970]  Mr. Rosenstein will be allowed to respond.
[01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:36.451]  I don't have any control over what resolutions you vote on, sir.
[01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:37.492]  I know you don't.
[01:27:37.732 --> 01:27:38.833]  The gentleman will suspend it.
[01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.674]  The time now is the Attorney General's.
[01:27:41.154 --> 01:27:50.199]  If you're interested in the truth, Mr. Jordan, the truth is we have a team of folks, they're Trump appointees and career folks, and they're doing their best to produce these documents.
[01:27:50.239 --> 01:27:52.200]  Director, I explained to you the process he's got.
[01:27:52.281 --> 01:28:00.205]  Yeah, just like we learned the guy that ran the IRS persecution via McCain for Obama, Trump didn't know and now appointed him to head up an agency.
[01:28:00.405 --> 01:28:01.246]  Trump's getting ready to get rid of it.
[01:28:01.866 --> 01:28:03.449]  So you're saying, oh, we got Trump appointees.
[01:28:03.509 --> 01:28:04.791]  They're the ones running all this.
[01:28:05.752 --> 01:28:06.934]  Just more garbage.
[01:28:07.555 --> 01:28:09.698]  It's more, oh, he runs the Justice Department.
[01:28:09.738 --> 01:28:10.279]  Yeah, right.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.020]  Continue.
[01:28:11.974 --> 01:28:12.995]  I support this report, sir.
[01:28:13.035 --> 01:28:14.476]  I'm not trying to hide anything from you.
[01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:33.370]  Yeah, right.
[01:28:34.011 --> 01:28:35.072]  Well, guess what, liar?
[01:28:35.092 --> 01:28:36.393]  You've already been caught lying a bunch.
[01:28:36.413 --> 01:28:41.537]  You've been running the whole operation to put McCabe under you and to launch the whole special counsel.
[01:28:41.617 --> 01:28:42.678]  You did all this.
[01:28:42.998 --> 01:28:43.979]  You're the ringleader.
[01:28:44.259 --> 01:28:52.626]  You're the chief dirty little Clinton dingleberry that is getting ready to get flushed down the toilet of history forever.
[01:28:53.126 --> 01:28:54.927]  We'll be back with a special guest and more.
[01:28:54.947 --> 01:28:55.428]  Stay with us.

[01:30:08.558 --> 01:30:09.479]  Hey Alex, mate.
[01:30:09.979 --> 01:30:13.540]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:26.886]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and
[01:30:26.886 --> 01:30:30.528]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[01:30:30.628 --> 01:30:37.512]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body.

[01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:39.073]  Thank you, brother.
[01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:47.658]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:30:47.738 --> 01:30:52.501]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:30:52.621 --> 01:30:55.463]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side

[01:32:06.859 --> 01:32:12.441]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:32:12.642 --> 01:32:13.742]  I'd done the War Room.
[01:32:14.042 --> 01:32:16.503]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:32:16.523 --> 01:32:18.084]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:32:18.124 --> 01:32:18.744]  I was exhausted.
[01:32:19.064 --> 01:32:22.345]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[01:32:22.665 --> 01:32:27.307]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[01:32:27.387 --> 01:32:29.408]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:32:29.468 --> 01:32:29.988]  Same thing.
[01:32:30.148 --> 01:32:32.229]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at Infowars.
[01:32:32.329 --> 01:32:33.550]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:35.572]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:32:35.852 --> 01:32:41.836]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:32:42.136 --> 01:32:42.937]  You can sleep with it.
[01:32:43.277 --> 01:32:47.600]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.442]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:32:50.602 --> 01:32:52.323]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:32:52.423 --> 01:32:53.123]  It really works.
[01:32:53.343 --> 01:32:57.866]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[01:33:00.128 --> 01:33:00.488]  Believe me.
[01:33:05.932 --> 01:33:12.197]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.319 --> 01:33:16.020]  You gotta keep them separated.
[01:33:29.069 --> 01:33:35.132]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:39.414 --> 01:33:40.735]  Hotep Jesus is coming up.
[01:33:40.795 --> 01:33:42.315]  Remember this when he went into Starbucks?
[01:33:42.555 --> 01:33:44.276]  How you doing?
[01:33:44.456 --> 01:33:45.037]  Good, how are you?
[01:33:45.217 --> 01:33:49.419]  Alright, I heard y'all was racist, so I came to get my own free coffee.
[01:33:49.939 --> 01:33:50.939]  I saw that.
[01:33:50.979 --> 01:33:56.202]  Yeah, I heard you guys don't like black people, so I wanted to get my Starbucks reparations voucher.
[01:33:57.867 --> 01:33:58.207]  What's that?
[01:33:58.287 --> 01:33:59.028]  Is that a real thing?
[01:33:59.408 --> 01:34:00.149]  It's a real thing.
[01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:01.730]  I mean, I'll give it to you.
[01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:03.151]  Yeah, I saw that on my Twitter last night.
[01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:04.452]  I was like, what the ****?
[01:34:04.512 --> 01:34:05.913]  Yeah, I need a free coffee.
[01:34:05.933 --> 01:34:07.494]  I'll give you a free coffee.
[01:34:07.534 --> 01:34:08.794]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:34:08.814 --> 01:34:10.035]  This is justice.
[01:34:10.215 --> 01:34:11.837]  No, where was it?
[01:34:12.097 --> 01:34:12.477]  Philly.
[01:34:12.577 --> 01:34:12.777]  Philly?
[01:34:12.817 --> 01:34:13.077]  What?
[01:34:13.217 --> 01:34:21.263]  Are you serious?
[01:34:21.423 --> 01:34:22.344]  This is justice.
[01:34:22.364 --> 01:34:23.364]  This is what I'm talking about.
[01:34:25.766 --> 01:34:27.007]  It's great customer service.
[01:34:29.793 --> 01:34:33.496]  I was reading that and I was like, there is no way.
[01:34:33.516 --> 01:34:33.796]  Absolutely.
[01:34:33.816 --> 01:34:39.079]  I think he has.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:39.920]  Could you imagine?
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.401]  Never here.
[01:34:41.421 --> 01:34:43.403]  Never here.
[01:34:43.543 --> 01:34:44.944]  You should throw some milk in it.
[01:34:44.964 --> 01:34:46.405]  Sure.
[01:34:46.945 --> 01:34:47.906]  What kind?
[01:34:48.546 --> 01:34:48.706]  Old.
[01:34:51.468 --> 01:34:51.708]  Yeah.
[01:34:52.549 --> 01:34:53.530]  Reparations, man.
[01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:56.972]  Gotta get my reparations for being black in America.
[01:34:57.312 --> 01:34:58.173]  Black Lives Matter.
[01:35:02.518 --> 01:35:03.720]  I'll take caramel.
[01:35:06.063 --> 01:35:06.964]  Is that gonna make it sweet?
[01:35:08.987 --> 01:35:09.247]  Yes.
[01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:12.311]  What's your name?
[01:35:12.331 --> 01:35:13.152]  I appreciate you.
[01:35:13.432 --> 01:35:13.913]  Amanda?
[01:35:14.153 --> 01:35:17.177]  Amanda, you are great.
[01:35:17.257 --> 01:35:17.477]  Is it?
[01:35:18.211 --> 01:35:18.731]  You're amazing.
[01:35:18.751 --> 01:35:19.131]  Thank you.
[01:35:19.311 --> 01:35:25.174]  I'm a student at Rider, and our finals are starting next week, so I had to let you know.
[01:35:25.194 --> 01:35:26.635]  That happened about a month and a half ago.
[01:35:26.655 --> 01:35:27.775]  One of the top stories in the country.
[01:35:27.835 --> 01:35:28.635]  He's been all over the news.
[01:35:28.695 --> 01:35:36.299]  Hotep Jesus joins us, and I didn't know until I heard he went on with Owen Schroeder that he was even a listener for a while, but he's got a long interesting
[01:35:37.359 --> 01:35:52.645]  I just want to get him on as a commentator routinely, to give his take on the world and the things he's doing, because I've seen that clip on my show, and then I saw him with Owen.
[01:35:52.685 --> 01:35:54.585]  I was like, well, I'm jealous Owen got him a couple times.
[01:35:54.645 --> 01:35:54.966]  I haven't.
[01:35:54.986 --> 01:35:57.266]  I watched the interview and really liked what he had to say.
[01:35:57.286 --> 01:36:00.368]  So we'll cover the waterfront, but I think his awakening is important.
[01:36:00.388 --> 01:36:03.249]  That's one of the things he wanted to talk about, because it's part of other people's awakening.
[01:36:04.289 --> 01:36:10.112]  Where is this point in the world we are right now, where things have gotten so crazy, and where does he think things are going next?
[01:36:10.132 --> 01:36:11.593]  So, Ho-Tep, thanks for joining us.
[01:36:12.953 --> 01:36:14.814]  Alex Jones, the man!
[01:36:14.854 --> 01:36:15.915]  What's up, baby?
[01:36:16.595 --> 01:36:17.616]  Hey, you're the man, my friend.
[01:36:17.636 --> 01:36:20.717]  That's a great, great thing you did at Starbucks, and all your other videos are awesome.
[01:36:20.958 --> 01:36:21.798]  Tell us about yourself.
[01:36:21.818 --> 01:36:22.859]  Tell us about your awakening.
[01:36:23.179 --> 01:36:29.282]  You want me to get into being a fan of the Infowar, Turning Point, Influencer, Ho-Tep, and Black Conservatives.
[01:36:30.171 --> 01:36:30.731]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:30.771 --> 01:36:33.733]  So first I want to just talk about my red pill.
[01:36:33.773 --> 01:36:44.060]  So, of course, I grew up HOTEP, but as far as the globalists are concerned and the New World Order and Bilderberg, you were my red pill for that.
[01:36:44.562 --> 01:36:49.565]  You know, understanding the Federal Reserve and how all of that stuff happens and works.
[01:36:49.985 --> 01:36:50.585]  That was you.
[01:36:50.665 --> 01:36:51.325]  That was all you.
[01:36:51.345 --> 01:36:59.950]  So I just want to say thank you for putting that information out there and being my red pill out of Zion as far as that respect and concern.
[01:37:00.964 --> 01:37:01.464]  Well, that's awesome.
[01:37:01.484 --> 01:37:04.607]  You know, they really demonized me and I'm willing to be demonized.
[01:37:04.627 --> 01:37:06.268]  They lie about what I say and do it twisted.
[01:37:07.249 --> 01:37:12.153]  To try to not point out that we've been very successful getting a lot of other great thinking minds just to get outside the box.
[01:37:12.173 --> 01:37:15.716]  I don't think you probably listened to what I had to say, but it just triggered something that was already in you.
[01:37:15.956 --> 01:37:22.761]  But the thing I'm most proud of is how many great activists from every walk of life I run into that were triggered by this broadcast.
[01:37:22.781 --> 01:37:25.784]  Not even so much by me, but just by all the great things we do at InfoWars.
[01:37:25.804 --> 01:37:28.046]  So God bless you and I'm very proud of that, my friend.
[01:37:28.726 --> 01:37:30.708]  I think activism was hijacked.
[01:37:30.748 --> 01:37:41.777]  I think what you started was a particular type of activism that spoke about very real issues, and then activism was hijacked when we talk about fluffy issues and bathrooms and all that nonsense.
[01:37:42.398 --> 01:37:46.381]  But I feel like you were a pioneer as far as the mental activism is concerned.
[01:37:46.401 --> 01:37:48.463]  But we gotta do one thing for the internets today.
[01:37:48.763 --> 01:37:50.285]  We gotta do one thing for the internets today.
[01:37:50.485 --> 01:37:53.828]  The internets need to see me and you, side by side,
[01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:56.983]  Screaming and raging at the globalists, man.
[01:37:57.003 --> 01:37:58.244]  Can you do that for me, man?
[01:37:58.664 --> 01:37:58.925]  Sure.
[01:37:59.585 --> 01:38:00.946]  I lose my voice.
[01:38:01.266 --> 01:38:04.708]  My voice used to be scratchy, but I scream so much, my larynx is gone.
[01:38:04.728 --> 01:38:23.979]  It's like, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[01:38:25.165 --> 01:38:25.865]  Felt good, didn't it?
[01:38:25.885 --> 01:38:28.426]  I didn't know you were going to do that.
[01:38:28.706 --> 01:38:28.826]  Ah!
[01:38:28.866 --> 01:38:29.747]  Feels good now.
[01:38:30.727 --> 01:38:33.869]  But it feels good to say, I'm done with whatever you... I'm not buying anything you say.
[01:38:33.949 --> 01:38:34.449]  I'm free.
[01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:36.129]  And I'm not buying your crap anymore.
[01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:36.930]  Ah!
[01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:39.011]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:39.071 --> 01:38:41.011]  That's how I feel when I come off my periscope.
[01:38:41.071 --> 01:38:42.492]  I got that Alex Jones ring.
[01:38:43.132 --> 01:38:43.272]  Ah!
[01:38:44.173 --> 01:38:44.853]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:44.933 --> 01:38:47.414]  I'm not old enough to do that anymore, if I tell you.
[01:38:50.297 --> 01:38:51.017]  We need that.
[01:38:51.357 --> 01:38:55.019]  The movement lacks passion and you bring passion and I love it, man.
[01:38:55.939 --> 01:39:04.883]  Well, usually when I do it, I kind of, I mean, I'm already passionate having you on, but I'm usually, something's already pissed me off and it's all coming to go, but I realize, you know, they're not going to suppress us and then I decide to fight and then it just happens.
[01:39:04.923 --> 01:39:08.405]  But yeah, they made some good memes with, um, what's that called?
[01:39:08.485 --> 01:39:09.565]  Super saiyan?
[01:39:09.625 --> 01:39:11.426]  It's some kind of Japanese TV thing where the guy goes, ah,
[01:39:12.862 --> 01:39:15.264]  Where do I see us in the world today?
[01:39:15.304 --> 01:39:21.871]  Man, I see us like right at the edge of where Rome falls, when Greece falls, when Egypt falls.
[01:39:36.388 --> 01:39:46.156]  You know, when you look at the similarities between a lot of the previous empires, it seems like the United States is at that fork in the road, where if we don't make the right turn, we fall.
[01:39:46.236 --> 01:39:49.358]  If we make the right turn, we succeed as a nation.
[01:39:49.378 --> 01:40:03.389]  And I think that the conservatives have the right idea, and I think that if we can get more black people off of the Democratic plantation and over to the conservative side, we can avoid the bad side of the fork in the road.
[01:40:05.325 --> 01:40:06.146]  I just got a chill.
[01:40:06.346 --> 01:40:08.047]  Every time I hear the truth, I get a chill.
[01:40:08.087 --> 01:40:08.868]  A good chill.
[01:40:08.888 --> 01:40:11.129]  There's a bad chill, you get a fear, but that good chill.
[01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:13.871]  And what you said is we are at the crossroads, aren't we?
[01:40:14.632 --> 01:40:16.433]  Yeah, we are definitely at the crossroads.
[01:40:16.453 --> 01:40:26.200]  This is the time where people really have to buckle down, look at the facts, remove emotions, and really get on the side of good.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.222]  You know, right now we're facing, it's really evil versus good.
[01:40:30.663 --> 01:40:33.645]  You know, when you look at the actions of Maxine Waters and
[01:40:34.281 --> 01:40:40.006]  How that trickled into reality, attacking a member of Congress, as we saw the other day.
[01:40:40.487 --> 01:40:43.510]  This stuff is actually starting to manifest as evil.
[01:40:43.630 --> 01:40:47.173]  It's been evil since the Black Lives Matter movement has started.
[01:40:47.573 --> 01:40:50.116]  And this is really a matter of good versus evil.
[01:40:50.136 --> 01:40:54.119]  So I tell people, hey, if you want to be on the side of good, trust me, it ain't the Democrats.
[01:40:54.299 --> 01:40:55.400]  There's the clip right there.
[01:40:55.481 --> 01:40:57.442]  As you can see, like, this is it manifesting.
[01:40:57.482 --> 01:40:57.823]  This is
[01:40:58.363 --> 01:41:00.486]  This is just completely uncalled for.
[01:41:00.566 --> 01:41:05.293]  Here we have two people that are of adult age who
[01:41:06.244 --> 01:41:09.087]  They're not supposed to be approached like this in public, right?
[01:41:09.327 --> 01:41:16.153]  Like, there's a professional way to handle your gripes with public officials, with government officials.
[01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:17.774]  And this just isn't it.
[01:41:17.794 --> 01:41:18.435]  This is evil.
[01:41:18.455 --> 01:41:19.336]  This is attacking.
[01:41:19.716 --> 01:41:20.777]  This is communism.
[01:41:20.797 --> 01:41:22.699]  Well, they're also projecting stuff.
[01:41:22.719 --> 01:41:24.580]  Mitch McConnell's been an open borders guy.
[01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:28.424]  So they just project Nazis, and the lady's, you know, Asian.
[01:41:28.444 --> 01:41:29.605]  She comes over, gets in their face.
[01:41:29.645 --> 01:41:33.108]  It's like, it's also that it'd be one thing if, like, these people
[01:41:33.328 --> 01:41:34.549]  Yes, that's exactly what this is.
[01:41:45.285 --> 01:41:45.945]  Projection.
[01:41:46.185 --> 01:41:51.167]  You know, when you look at the Democratic Party and the history of Democratic Party, we know they're the ones that enslaved my people.
[01:41:51.207 --> 01:41:55.448]  We know that they're the ones that implemented Jim Crow.
[01:41:55.788 --> 01:42:00.090]  They're the ones that are the reason why we call ourselves black instead of African.
[01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:07.852]  They've done so many demonic things to us, and now here they are trying to project that onto Republicans and the conservative side of things.
[01:42:08.272 --> 01:42:09.133]  And that's exactly it.
[01:42:09.393 --> 01:42:10.834]  You hit the nail on the head with that.
[01:42:11.134 --> 01:42:12.755]  This is merely projection.
[01:42:12.775 --> 01:42:17.518]  This is evil projecting so that people don't look at them as evil and look at us as the evil.
[01:42:17.538 --> 01:42:18.679]  They've got to flip the script.
[01:42:19.139 --> 01:42:20.100]  And that's absolutely true.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.502]  We're all Americans, but we can all say we're people and be proud of where we came from at the same time.
[01:42:24.542 --> 01:42:27.384]  And the Democrats have put out so many names for everybody.
[01:42:27.684 --> 01:42:30.046]  They just want to be the person that names it whatever they want.
[01:42:30.226 --> 01:42:31.327]  They're going to change it all the time.
[01:42:32.671 --> 01:42:33.172]  Absolutely.
[01:42:33.692 --> 01:42:40.097]  Malcolm X has a quote, I forget what it is, but he talks about, be careful the media will have you hating the good guys.
[01:42:40.838 --> 01:42:42.079]  And that's what we're coming to right now.
[01:43:04.033 --> 01:43:19.271]  Tomorrow's news today, we broke down even before the London Guardian did with Leo Zagami about four or five years ago, that you would have this new Pope, the head of the Jesuits, and that now Pope Francis, as he's known, would try to finally destroy any
[01:43:19.591 --> 01:43:22.773]  Christianity, any conservatism in the Catholic Church.
[01:43:22.833 --> 01:43:28.396]  And he's now declared war on borders, declared war saying he's disgusted by people talking about Europe's Christian roots.
[01:43:28.576 --> 01:43:33.478]  He's calling for major governments to be disarmed, but of course the UN will be armed right out of Hunger Games.
[01:43:33.699 --> 01:43:43.884]  And his right-hand man, the number three person at the Vatican, Cardinal George Pell, to face trial on historic abuse charges reportedly trafficking in hundreds of young boys for decades.
[01:43:44.164 --> 01:43:45.085]  Who is this Pope?
[01:43:45.105 --> 01:43:48.627]  Why does he live behind 180-foot walls that says Europe shouldn't have any?
[01:43:48.687 --> 01:43:51.068]  Why does he say he doesn't like Europe's Christian roots?
[01:43:51.108 --> 01:43:52.849]  Why is he allied with radical Islam?
[01:43:53.049 --> 01:43:57.072]  Why is he saying the whole world should turn their weapons in, but of course the UN and the globalists?
[01:43:57.112 --> 01:44:11.781]  When we talk about Pope Francis preaching now via Twitter that everybody should disarm itself and get rid of weapons, we have to understand that Pope Francis has the best bodyguards on the planet!
[01:44:13.161 --> 01:44:17.543]  He's trained since basically 600 years ago.
[01:44:17.563 --> 01:44:20.045]  There are 125 Swiss Guards.
[01:44:20.185 --> 01:44:22.266]  They use the most lethal weapons.
[01:44:22.626 --> 01:44:29.589]  So to actually state that he wants to get rid of his weapons is the biggest joke ever.
[01:44:29.789 --> 01:44:30.550]  Really, Alex.
[01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:31.330]  It's hilarious.
[01:44:31.910 --> 01:45:01.390]  And regarding Cardinal Pell, Cardinal Pell now is facing also, of course, a lot of criticism within the Vatican conservative side that tomorrow has a very important event, and that is the election of the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta that will take place on the 2nd, tomorrow, the 2nd of May 2018, in a period of uncertainty for the Knights of Malta that are seen by Pope Francis as a threat.
[01:45:01.730 --> 01:45:15.539]  Because within the Knights of Malta there are certain conservative forces that have been laying down for centuries there and don't want to give up on real Catholicism, which of course Pope Francis is completely destroying.
[01:45:15.639 --> 01:45:22.103]  This is a big thing, Alex, especially now because the Pope wants to destroy the Knights of Malta,
[01:45:22.944 --> 01:45:23.464]  We're good to go.
[01:45:51.798 --> 01:46:01.226]  But of course, if the conservative forces lose tomorrow, the Knights of Malta will be taken over by the Jesuits and they will be destroyed.
[01:46:02.847 --> 01:46:05.510]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:11.054]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[01:46:11.735 --> 01:46:14.657]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[01:46:15.098 --> 01:46:18.621]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[01:46:19.221 --> 01:46:30.509]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:41.877]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.

[01:47:00.934 --> 01:47:02.576]  We need your support.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.503]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.812 --> 01:47:22.532]  Big Brother.
[01:47:22.933 --> 01:47:24.194]  Mainstream media.
[01:47:24.734 --> 01:47:25.835]  Government cover-ups.
[01:47:26.615 --> 01:47:28.076]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:28.336 --> 01:47:29.497]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:29.997 --> 01:47:34.740]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:36.761 --> 01:47:40.724]  Right now, the globalists, the big megabanks, the Satanists, that's who they are.
[01:47:42.418 --> 01:47:45.679]  People are panicking because humanity's waking up all over the planet.
[01:47:46.259 --> 01:47:48.340]  Exclusive report up on InfoWars.com.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.641]  We can put that back up, thanks.
[01:47:51.381 --> 01:47:54.623]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is in the front running.
[01:47:55.643 --> 01:47:58.824]  He's the top front runner for Trump's Supreme Court pick.
[01:47:59.284 --> 01:48:04.806]  Napolitano was told he was top picked in 2017 by the president face to face.
[01:48:05.947 --> 01:48:07.147]  Let's just add by the president there.
[01:48:07.167 --> 01:48:08.028]  Great job, Kit Daniels.
[01:48:08.668 --> 01:48:09.248]  Get that article up.
[01:48:09.268 --> 01:48:11.269]  There's a video with Roger Stone on last hour.
[01:48:12.662 --> 01:48:24.525]  I had it from other sources that some that were at the Trump Tower when this happened, it was when the President was moving back and forth, and Gorsuch was in because you had the obvious assassination of Scalia.
[01:48:24.545 --> 01:48:28.046]  And I said, when our reporters were down there, it's like Bohemian Grove.
[01:48:28.366 --> 01:48:30.526]  Turned out it is a Bohemian Grove facility.
[01:48:32.147 --> 01:48:33.807]  And it turns out it was a secret society.
[01:48:35.054 --> 01:48:37.757]  I mean, this stuff just gets crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:48:37.777 --> 01:48:42.862]  We're going back to Hotel Jesus in about 15 minutes to the next hour, and then we've got Roger Stone joining us from his studio.
[01:48:42.902 --> 01:48:45.505]  He was on the phone earlier getting off a plane at the airport.
[01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:48.290]  Big things are happening.
[01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:52.511]  And again, it isn't that Trump's perfect, or I'm perfect, or ho-tep Jesus is perfect, or anybody.
[01:48:52.851 --> 01:48:54.452]  It's that we're not out to get ya.
[01:48:54.852 --> 01:48:56.292]  We want a pro-human future.
[01:48:56.892 --> 01:49:02.754]  And we don't want to abort babies whether they got brown skin, or pink skin, or, you know, pot-marked skin like mine.
[01:49:03.274 --> 01:49:07.355]  We don't like crazy white people, crazy black people, crazy anybody out there.
[01:49:07.375 --> 01:49:08.155]  There's bad people everywhere.
[01:49:08.175 --> 01:49:10.256]  There's people that organize themselves in bad groups, whatever.
[01:49:11.316 --> 01:49:24.509]  And all of us, you know, get sucked into it at times, but the point is that there's an evil plan that puts fluoride in everybody's water, that feeds everybody GMO, that is trying to destroy our future, trying to keep us from getting advanced technologies, that's trying to destroy civilization.
[01:49:24.929 --> 01:49:33.297]  What HOTEP got into for the general public, even though it comes from us, the technology comes from us, the average people, whether it was in Africa, where a lot of technology came from, or Asia, or wherever.
[01:49:34.317 --> 01:49:37.218]  It builds up, and then it... and everything's gone.
[01:49:37.618 --> 01:49:38.078]  He hit that.
[01:49:38.679 --> 01:49:41.480]  And the globalists want to be able to do that to everybody else but themselves.
[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:43.800]  We're going to talk about that with Hotep, because I noticed he brought that up.
[01:49:44.201 --> 01:49:52.904]  But before we go any further, I sell some products at such low prices that we don't make a ton of money on them, so we've got to sell a lot of them.
[01:49:52.924 --> 01:50:02.187]  And I want to expand on the face of George Soros and his lawsuits and all this, and we're having a lot of victories in court against him, and we're going to continue to be here, but we need a regular listener that's on the fence.
[01:50:03.274 --> 01:50:04.798]  You don't want to use fluoride toothpaste.
[01:50:04.858 --> 01:50:10.111]  Then we have the very best organic with iodine, colloidal silver, fortified super blue, and it's 50% off.
[01:50:10.151 --> 01:50:11.875]  It's already our best seller for total volume.
[01:50:12.517 --> 01:50:12.757]  Sold.
[01:50:14.087 --> 01:50:15.648]  But it's got $3 a product in it.
[01:50:16.128 --> 01:50:17.849]  The average toothpaste is like five, six bucks.
[01:50:17.869 --> 01:50:18.789]  It's got 50 cents in it.
[01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:20.050]  Count in the container.
[01:50:20.290 --> 01:50:23.732]  Ours is made by the biggest organic manufacturer in the country with our iodine and chlorosilver added.
[01:50:23.932 --> 01:50:24.732]  There's no fillers.
[01:50:25.013 --> 01:50:26.233]  My dad's a dentist and oral surgeon.
[01:50:26.533 --> 01:50:27.454]  He quarterbacked it.
[01:50:28.054 --> 01:50:30.475]  And so it's got thousands of five-star reviews.
[01:50:31.196 --> 01:50:33.397]  It's got $3 a product in it.
[01:50:33.437 --> 01:50:37.519]  Now, we normally sell it for like 12 bucks or something because we need to make some money to fund all this.
[01:50:37.739 --> 01:50:38.580]  At 50% off right now, it's $7.
[01:50:41.135 --> 01:50:42.616]  It is the best toothpaste out there.
[01:50:42.837 --> 01:50:43.657]  Now, it's very strong.
[01:50:43.697 --> 01:50:46.619]  You might want to water it down with another organic toothpaste or something.
[01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:49.461]  That's what my kids do where they use the children's.
[01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:50.021]  50% off right now.
[01:50:50.642 --> 01:50:51.903]  We've got the air purifiers.
[01:50:52.363 --> 01:50:53.244]  The Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:50:53.844 --> 01:50:57.086]  It's a four-stage ion HEPA filter.
[01:50:57.206 --> 01:50:58.768]  Way lower price than leading competitors.
[01:50:58.988 --> 01:51:00.609]  They just add three, four times markup.
[01:51:01.429 --> 01:51:02.810]  It's $100 off right now.
[01:51:03.371 --> 01:51:04.612]  I can tell you $100 off.
[01:51:04.632 --> 01:51:06.433]  Between the manufacturer and myself, we split $70.
[01:51:08.394 --> 01:51:13.059]  So, you gotta sell a lot of these, but that's my game plan is, people go out and research.
[01:51:13.099 --> 01:51:14.260]  We sell thousands of these.
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.462]  They go, wow, this really is a good deal.
[01:51:16.922 --> 01:51:19.625]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:51:19.645 --> 01:51:23.729]  Discounted like this, that is a, that's not even 100% markup.
[01:51:23.789 --> 01:51:25.430]  If it was 160 bucks, it'd be 100%.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:35.241]  It's like an 80% markup, and that's on sale.
[01:51:35.341 --> 01:51:35.901]  It's normally $2.50.
[01:51:36.682 --> 01:51:40.603]  So, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[01:51:41.764 --> 01:51:48.486]  And it's critical, that's why they don't want us to have an economy, to support, even if you're totally awake about what's going on, get Hotep Jesus' books.
[01:51:49.286 --> 01:51:52.447]  And if you read them, give them to the library, or give them to your neighbors.
[01:51:52.547 --> 01:51:53.328]  It's all about
[01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:55.769]  Supporting independent thinking.
[01:51:55.789 --> 01:52:05.878]  Now, Hotep, there's a lot to cover in the next couple of segments, and I just did a long plug, but front and center, you're talking about where we are in history, this crossroads, and what the globalists are wanting to do.
[01:52:05.898 --> 01:52:07.280]  What other knowledge do you want to lay on us?
[01:52:08.741 --> 01:52:16.489]  Well, this weekend I spent some time with Turning Point USA, and they created a retreat for the black conservatives.
[01:52:17.339 --> 01:52:23.901]  And so I just want to take some time to kind of educate people on that and educate people on HOTEP and how that relates to the black community.
[01:52:23.941 --> 01:52:25.362]  So I think I should start there first.
[01:52:26.202 --> 01:52:28.642]  In a black community, you're one of two things.
[01:52:28.662 --> 01:52:30.663]  You're either a black conservative or you're HOTEP.
[01:52:30.723 --> 01:52:32.724]  And often those two things become synonymous.
[01:52:34.984 --> 01:52:40.646]  A black conservative would be like Carlton from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
[01:52:40.966 --> 01:52:45.348]  That's what they would consider the token or icon.
[01:52:48.058 --> 01:52:50.058]  Yeah, yeah, that's the look you would get.
[01:52:50.499 --> 01:53:06.982]  Now, you have another section of the black community, which is more urban, possibly spent some time in jail, definitely a little bit more street down to earth, but has awakened mentally, is more conscious, is off the Democratic plantation, and they call those HOTEP.
[01:53:07.382 --> 01:53:15.624]  Whether they are subscribed to the HOTEP ideology or not, if you go just do a quick search engine search,
[01:53:16.663 --> 01:53:18.346]  Um, on DuckDuckGo or whatever.
[01:53:18.907 --> 01:53:20.088]  And just type in HOTEP.
[01:53:20.269 --> 01:53:24.615]  And you'll see a list of slandering articles when they slander us.
[01:53:24.635 --> 01:53:26.157]  Sure, the system's afraid of HOTEP.
[01:53:26.498 --> 01:53:27.960]  So explain what HOTEP is then.
[01:53:29.153 --> 01:53:33.156]  HOTEP is really, I would say, Afrocentric consciousness.
[01:53:34.137 --> 01:53:38.741]  Which, by the way, is a good thing if it's good roots and empowering.
[01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:41.563]  The globalists don't want anybody to have their real roots.
[01:53:41.783 --> 01:53:46.747]  They want this fake plastic thing for everybody so everybody realizes who their roots are and how it all comes together.
[01:53:47.648 --> 01:53:49.389]  Yeah, I mean, look at Black Lives Matter.
[01:53:49.409 --> 01:53:54.433]  That was supposed to be for African people and it turned out to be for everybody but African people.
[01:53:55.672 --> 01:54:00.196]  They had it co-opted by George Soros with his Open Society and all of his funding.
[01:54:01.337 --> 01:54:07.242]  And then what they did was they used all that funding to attack HOTEPs because they don't want a conscious message to get out.
[01:54:07.503 --> 01:54:12.007]  Because they know that HOTEPs can bring empowerment to conservatism.
[01:54:12.827 --> 01:54:18.709]  Because we have so much stain, because we have so much respect in the streets with real black people.
[01:54:19.049 --> 01:54:26.470]  Not the bourgeoisie that lives in the NAACP and the black caucus that tries to speak for us, but is completely detached from reality.
[01:54:27.531 --> 01:54:31.732]  Which is where the Turning Point Retreat comes in this weekend.
[01:54:31.752 --> 01:54:35.973]  I spent a lot of time with people like James T. Harris, who's an OG black conservative.
[01:54:36.713 --> 01:54:38.193]  Amazing Lucas.
[01:54:38.273 --> 01:54:40.474]  I know you're probably familiar with his work.
[01:54:40.494 --> 01:54:41.034]  Oh, he was here, yeah.
[01:54:42.344 --> 01:54:43.564]  Yeah, awesome guy.
[01:54:43.604 --> 01:54:45.545]  I spoke to him till like 3.30 in the morning.
[01:54:46.465 --> 01:54:47.485]  Shout out to Brandon Tatum.
[01:54:47.525 --> 01:54:48.786]  Brandon Tatum put it together.
[01:54:49.986 --> 01:54:51.567]  Spent some time with Candace Owens.
[01:54:51.607 --> 01:54:54.127]  We had dinner, we had lunch, we had good chats, good talks.
[01:54:54.487 --> 01:55:03.510]  And I know you know Candace Owens, so she has some things up her sleeve that's gonna propel the black conservatism in this country.
[01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:10.072]  And that's really scaring the Democratic Party and the globalists and literal Nazi Soros.
[01:55:11.458 --> 01:55:12.358]  Oh yeah!
[01:55:12.798 --> 01:55:18.200]  This is the antidote to the cancer that the left is.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.520]  We call it the evil left.
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.281]  And this is the antidote to all of that.
[01:55:23.141 --> 01:55:29.723]  This is the red pill for the mind of people who are still sleeping or still plugged into the mainstream.
[01:55:29.763 --> 01:55:31.423]  Let me just quantify this from your own perspective.
[01:55:31.443 --> 01:55:32.804]  You know more about this from your perspective than I do.
[01:55:33.686 --> 01:55:47.776]  The true libertarian, right-wing, Christian, pro-Renaissance group, whatever you want to call it, is simply saying, we want to empower everybody, and that would actually create a system that would empower people and make them not dependent.
[01:55:47.976 --> 01:55:50.998]  The left goes, oh, we're going to protect you, but then they destroy you and make you dependent.
[01:55:51.238 --> 01:55:57.943]  And so that's what's so attractive about real red pill conservatism, is that it's saying, no, we recognize your power, we want you to be powerful.
[01:55:59.045 --> 01:56:00.385]  Correct, correct.
[01:56:00.405 --> 01:56:01.606]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:56:01.966 --> 01:56:05.467]  The thing is, Democrats want to disenfranchise.
[01:56:05.927 --> 01:56:11.529]  They want to suck or siphon power out of the community.
[01:56:11.789 --> 01:56:13.130]  You see, it doesn't happen overnight.
[01:56:13.150 --> 01:56:18.572]  You see, when you come in and you practice, you know, warfare, you come in, you bomb, and it's just over with.
[01:56:18.632 --> 01:56:19.952]  No, that's not what Democrats do.
[01:56:20.272 --> 01:56:25.554]  They siphon, and they, like a parasite, they slowly suck the life
[01:56:26.034 --> 01:56:26.314]  Beautiful.
[01:56:26.334 --> 01:56:28.356]  We're going to go to break in a few minutes.
[01:56:28.396 --> 01:56:32.878]  I want to come back and talk about, from your unique perspective, what's happening.
[01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:33.379]  But it's real.
[01:56:54.790 --> 01:57:12.009]  It's just crazy that it's like Donald Trump was a flashpoint for it because the black community, going back 30-40 years, knew that Trump was actually just pro-everybody, he likes everybody, and then they now try to demonize him from the corporate level, but deep down, everybody that's known Trump knows that's not true.
[01:57:13.428 --> 01:57:14.128]  Absolutely.
[01:57:14.288 --> 01:57:18.050]  The black community knows it's not true, for the most part.
[01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:23.193]  The issue is that the media has done such a great job of brainwashing people.
[01:57:23.513 --> 01:57:34.858]  They've done such a great job of making the MAGA hat a symbol of hate that people are now deterred from goodness, from righteousness, from America.
[01:57:35.038 --> 01:57:41.201]  Like, this is the first time since I've been alive in 38 years I've seen people become anti-American and it's sickening.
[01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:45.068]  And that's because the globalists that captured America, they were siphoning it to for evil.
[01:57:45.348 --> 01:57:50.077]  Now that America's having a crisis of soul and might become good again, that's why they're scared.
[01:57:50.417 --> 01:57:51.540]  And now that's why they're saying it's bad.
[01:57:55.444 --> 01:57:57.286]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[01:57:57.306 --> 01:57:57.587]  Go ahead.
[01:57:57.727 --> 01:58:01.612]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[01:58:01.732 --> 01:58:06.778]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[01:58:07.318 --> 01:58:12.865]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[01:58:13.686 --> 01:58:21.948]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[01:58:22.788 --> 01:58:25.509]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:29.810]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:36.732]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[01:58:37.392 --> 01:58:41.556]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[01:58:41.956 --> 01:58:45.259]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[01:58:45.939 --> 01:58:50.203]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[01:58:50.704 --> 01:58:56.288]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well at water.
[01:58:56.368 --> 01:59:00.892]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[01:59:01.732 --> 01:59:03.033]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[01:59:03.233 --> 01:59:08.597]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[01:59:08.617 --> 01:59:09.878]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[01:59:09.918 --> 01:59:10.098]  Yeah.
[01:59:10.258 --> 01:59:12.119]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[01:59:12.159 --> 01:59:13.000]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:14.721]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[01:59:14.741 --> 01:59:15.722]  We really appreciate you.
[01:59:15.782 --> 01:59:16.782]  Keep up the fight.
[01:59:16.802 --> 01:59:18.223]  We need to take California back.
[01:59:18.243 --> 01:59:18.604]  Thank you, Desiree.
[01:59:18.624 --> 01:59:19.724]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[01:59:19.764 --> 01:59:20.345]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[01:59:22.358 --> 01:59:29.263]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[01:59:29.523 --> 01:59:33.766]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.

[01:59:39.309 --> 01:59:42.291]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[01:59:42.532 --> 01:59:43.752]  It's Brain Force Plus.

[01:59:54.800 --> 02:00:00.783]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.369 --> 02:00:14.972]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.453 --> 02:00:16.934]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:17.014 --> 02:00:18.875]  InfoWorth.com, yeah.
[02:00:23.939 --> 02:00:30.241]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.101 --> 02:00:40.324]  See, my family were like Protestant Republicans.
[02:00:40.604 --> 02:00:47.306]  And so anybody that was racist was like seen as a loser that wanted to put somebody else down to make themselves feel big.
[02:00:47.706 --> 02:00:49.187]  But I was never really around Democrats.
[02:00:50.219 --> 02:00:55.482]  And then when I got into media, and I would go out and protest at abortion clinics and stuff, I'd have black people come over.
[02:00:56.323 --> 02:00:58.164]  And I've had, like, Reverend Childress on.
[02:00:58.204 --> 02:00:59.565]  He says, oh, absolutely, that happens to me all the time.
[02:00:59.905 --> 02:01:00.946]  He's against black genocide.
[02:01:00.966 --> 02:01:03.747]  And they start foaming at the mouth.
[02:01:03.787 --> 02:01:07.930]  This is a virtue signal when I say this, because I don't tip Jesus on here, whether he's African or whatever.
[02:01:09.431 --> 02:01:10.591]  They would go, you don't want to.
[02:01:10.611 --> 02:01:11.512]  Now you see it on the news.
[02:01:11.552 --> 02:01:13.033]  Project Veritas has caught it in others.
[02:01:14.625 --> 02:01:18.071]  You don't want those black babies, you need to take some of your honor, blah blah blah.
[02:01:18.772 --> 02:01:25.282]  And it's like foaming at the mouth like Renfield black people who've been hired by the liberal Draculas.
[02:01:27.188 --> 02:01:31.251]  And it's really true, like Bob Marley said, the Babylon system is the vampire.
[02:01:31.891 --> 02:01:37.575]  And it is true, if you want to talk about blacks or Africans being targeted, that that was the beta test of the vampirism.
[02:01:38.096 --> 02:01:45.381]  And if you go into leftist communities, I don't care if they're white Appalachians or black Prairies, the people are like hopeless and they walk around like zombies.
[02:01:46.362 --> 02:01:53.173]  And you talk about vampirism, this is a short segment, longer segment coming up, but I'm telling you, they, the left knows.
[02:01:53.354 --> 02:01:57.661]  I go to these events, we've had undercovers go in, and they're devil worshippers.
[02:01:58.556 --> 02:02:02.339]  And they say, we want to kill people, we want to enslave them, we love Satan.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:11.947]  And then I came to the realization the last five years, that I knew they were into devil worship high up, but I didn't realize it was like all the way down into it.
[02:02:12.508 --> 02:02:21.956]  And I don't know why, on the list of people to hurt, black folks, Africans, are one of the favorite hors d'oeuvres.
[02:02:23.137 --> 02:02:25.579]  Am I wrong there in the three minutes we've got, or could you explain that to me?
[02:02:26.698 --> 02:02:28.060]  No, you are not wrong.
[02:02:28.281 --> 02:02:30.123]  Hors d'oeuvres is funny.
[02:02:32.066 --> 02:02:34.750]  But yeah, sometimes I feel like we're the main cause.
[02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:35.772]  No, no, I agree.
[02:02:35.792 --> 02:02:38.736]  But I'm just saying that's the thing that they like, the thing that they started with that.
[02:02:38.816 --> 02:02:40.398]  It's like, I think that's the start of the meal.
[02:02:41.232 --> 02:02:43.454]  Yeah, no, you hit that straight on the head, you know.
[02:02:43.474 --> 02:02:45.275]  I have no pushback on that at all.
[02:02:46.536 --> 02:02:48.277]  We are fodder, almost.
[02:02:49.438 --> 02:02:51.600]  There's many different theories as to why.
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:52.260]  I agree.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:54.962]  It's one of the big targets of depopulation with Oprah ahead of it.
[02:02:55.863 --> 02:02:57.364]  When I say on DERV, it started with you.
[02:02:58.288 --> 02:02:59.109]  Right, right.
[02:02:59.229 --> 02:03:00.269]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:00.329 --> 02:03:01.230]  No, I totally get it.
[02:03:02.111 --> 02:03:03.952]  Let's look at Planned Parenthood, right?
[02:03:04.292 --> 02:03:07.394]  You have this thing called Planned Parenthood, started out with Margaret Sanger.
[02:03:07.414 --> 02:03:10.056]  Margaret Sanger's known to have ties with the KKK.
[02:03:10.416 --> 02:03:18.482]  Then you have people like Jamela Lemieux, who gets money and awards from Planned Parenthood to push her feminism.
[02:03:19.122 --> 02:03:27.824]  And then, when confronted about Margaret Sanger, she goes, oh, well, she's dead, and just because she started this doesn't mean that's what this is anymore, right?
[02:03:28.344 --> 02:03:38.006]  But then, if I align with Republicans, they try to take everything Republicans or conservatives are allegedly associated with and throw that in our face, but we can't use this.
[02:03:38.306 --> 02:03:41.827]  Meanwhile, when you look at Planned Parenthood, the name is inaccurate.
[02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:43.587]  They don't plan parenthood, they plan death.
[02:03:44.127 --> 02:03:47.588]  And if you look at what they provide for women, period,
[02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:51.192]  The only thing they provide for women are prenatal vitamins.
[02:03:51.833 --> 02:03:52.974]  The rest is abortion.
[02:03:53.174 --> 02:03:55.076]  They should just call it the abortion clinic.
[02:03:55.376 --> 02:03:57.338]  They're not planting any parenthood, they're planting death.
[02:03:57.578 --> 02:03:59.240]  And where do they stick them?
[02:04:01.702 --> 02:04:03.203]  They take them and they put them in Pepsi.
[02:04:03.403 --> 02:04:04.424]  That's what they do with the baby.
[02:04:04.564 --> 02:04:10.389]  They put them in Pepsi, they sell them, they sell the body parts, they sell the stem cells, and then they make money off of the black baby.
[02:04:10.649 --> 02:04:14.533]  Matter of fact, Planned Parenthood makes more money off black babies than black people do.
[02:04:14.833 --> 02:04:15.654]  I'm sure of that.
[02:04:17.356 --> 02:04:28.209]  Um, they make more money off black people, period, when you have people like the feminist, the black feminist movement, who actually work for these, uh, globalist-backed regimes.
[02:04:28.369 --> 02:04:29.410]  That's exactly what they are.
[02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:31.532]  As you know, that was Margaret Sanger's job.
[02:04:32.573 --> 02:04:37.057]  We've got her famous diaries in the Kellogg's and Colgate Foundation.
[02:04:37.638 --> 02:04:44.124]  She said, we've got to hire blacks, get them trained to go out and control the other people to exterminate these Africans.
[02:04:44.524 --> 02:04:46.265]  We'll be back with Hotep Jesus on the other side.
[02:04:46.285 --> 02:04:47.627]  We're going to get him back a lot more.
[02:04:48.527 --> 02:04:49.789]  He's doing great work.
[02:04:49.809 --> 02:04:56.514]  And then we've got Roger Stone with exclusives on the hearings today and on the new Supreme Court nominee, Andrew Napolitano.
[02:04:56.955 --> 02:04:58.977]  Stay with us in fullwars.com, newswars.com.

[02:06:14.921 --> 02:06:17.763]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:37.793 --> 02:06:41.654]  Donald Trump is breaking the will of the globalists.
[02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:43.415]  We're all breaking the will of it ourselves.
[02:06:43.435 --> 02:06:49.217]  And I can tell you, Trump is pro-Christian, he's pro-God, he's pro-freedom, but he's not a hypocrite.
[02:06:49.757 --> 02:06:51.658]  He doesn't sound like a Pharisee telling you how great he is.
[02:06:51.738 --> 02:07:00.821]  But, Trump particularly, in private conversations, and now, I told people about this a couple years ago, but now he says it, it's about energy.
[02:07:01.362 --> 02:07:02.602]  It's not some new agey thing.
[02:07:03.042 --> 02:07:04.563]  He doesn't like the energy of death.
[02:07:05.558 --> 02:07:08.659]  He doesn't like the energy of being a vampire.
[02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:13.461]  Now, he's also the type of guy, if you want to make mistakes and stuff, that's up to you.
[02:07:13.481 --> 02:07:14.301]  He's all about free will.
[02:07:15.542 --> 02:07:17.262]  But it's not just Trump.
[02:07:17.542 --> 02:07:29.947]  He's here at a critical time where all these other nationalists from the continent of South America, Africa, Australia, Russia, Europe, Eurasia, everywhere, people, this is happening.
[02:07:31.053 --> 02:07:33.595]  And there's a force trying to control human destiny.
[02:07:33.655 --> 02:07:38.640]  And Hotep Jesus is an African activist who's exploded onto the scene.
[02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:40.221]  Tens of millions of views on his videos.
[02:07:40.922 --> 02:07:43.384]  And he's just gone to the Turning Point USA.
[02:07:43.404 --> 02:07:44.345]  I was flying out of D.C.
[02:07:44.385 --> 02:07:47.427]  to wherever our flights were changing back to Texas.
[02:07:47.467 --> 02:07:50.870]  And I flew with the number two guy in Turning Point USA.
[02:07:50.910 --> 02:07:53.393]  And he was talking about some of the plans, the things that were going on.
[02:07:55.063 --> 02:07:59.004]  They recommended, you know, that Watson go do some major stuff in DC, but of course Watson doesn't want to do that.
[02:07:59.044 --> 02:07:59.985]  I'm not bitching at Watson.
[02:08:00.025 --> 02:08:06.807]  It's just that there's just so many opportunities, but there's only so many people, Watson does a great job, who particularly want to get in the streets.
[02:08:07.327 --> 02:08:09.748]  And I think that it's engaging people that does that.
[02:08:09.768 --> 02:08:10.628]  And, Hotep, talk about...
[02:08:11.408 --> 02:08:14.873]  Well, you've got the floor for the rest of the segment, whatever you want to get into, but I know you're out there in the streets.
[02:08:15.494 --> 02:08:25.789]  What is the real pulse of the African community in this country from the poll numbers we see versus the reality?
[02:08:27.017 --> 02:08:30.579]  Alright, real quick before we get into that, I just want to touch on this one stat.
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:33.622]  So check this out, right?
[02:08:34.122 --> 02:08:35.783]  This is according to Planned Parenthood.
[02:08:36.243 --> 02:08:38.525]  They have 17,419 instances of prenatal care services versus
[02:08:44.528 --> 02:08:49.349]  3.5 million STD tests and 323,000 abortions, right?
[02:08:49.809 --> 02:08:56.531]  So prenatal care services only account for about 5% of their services.
[02:08:57.031 --> 02:09:02.912]  Only 5% of their services are for Planned Parenthood, and black people are backing this.
[02:09:03.272 --> 02:09:04.272]  This is an atrocity.
[02:09:04.352 --> 02:09:05.612]  I did a story about this.
[02:09:05.632 --> 02:09:09.713]  It's called Planned Parenthood Wants to Kill Black People on hotepnation.com.
[02:09:10.013 --> 02:09:13.014]  This is one of the devils in our community that we're trying to fight.
[02:09:13.354 --> 02:09:15.676]  But, I just wanted to cover that really fast.
[02:09:15.696 --> 02:09:19.820]  No, no, Hotep, you're absolutely right, because I saw books by Brian.com.
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:21.001]  Tell us about the website.
[02:09:21.021 --> 02:09:21.722]  Where should people go?
[02:09:22.762 --> 02:09:33.666]  Well, BooksFriedDine.com is a landing page I created for my marketing book, and it just basically tells you how I got on Starbucks, how I used psychology to build a following.
[02:09:34.627 --> 02:09:41.650]  Just by being myself, a lot of people think you have to be something else to be something in the world.
[02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:42.890]  Tell me about your main site, though.
[02:09:46.364 --> 02:09:48.646]  The main site is hotepnation.com.
[02:09:49.126 --> 02:09:50.087]  Hotepnation.com.
[02:09:50.107 --> 02:09:50.928]  I want to plug that.
[02:09:50.968 --> 02:09:52.629]  I've seen it before and I'm glad you reminded me of it.
[02:09:53.449 --> 02:09:53.750]  Yeah.
[02:09:53.930 --> 02:09:56.672]  So what you're getting at here is there's a litmus test.
[02:09:57.232 --> 02:09:59.694]  As I've said, I don't want to hear you claim your virtues signaling.
[02:09:59.714 --> 02:10:01.075]  I don't want to hear how much you hate cops.
[02:10:01.095 --> 02:10:04.878]  I don't want to hear how much you care about how you want to help African people or anybody else in this country.
[02:10:05.358 --> 02:10:09.161]  The fact that the left is targeting black people for abortion
[02:10:09.781 --> 02:10:12.241]  Targeting them to be killed, that's the litmus test.
[02:10:12.301 --> 02:10:20.263]  And the left, though, when you bring that up to one of these, you know, so-called, you know, African leaders or whatever in the U.S., they just cut and run because they're bought and paid for.
[02:10:20.543 --> 02:10:33.225]  They'll pull up in their brand new Mercedes in a neighborhood they don't live in, they'll give some racist speech, cause a bunch of infighting, and meanwhile you drive across town, 99% of the white people you talk to are not, I hate Africans, I want to abort their ass.
[02:10:33.605 --> 02:10:37.726]  So the natural ally of everybody is Christians and others that aren't into death.
[02:10:38.971 --> 02:10:39.792]  Yes, yes.
[02:10:40.312 --> 02:10:52.142]  The black community, or I'm sorry, I should say the black bourgeoisie, the black so-called media, which we know is not black owned, is being paid to attack men like me.
[02:10:52.522 --> 02:10:56.485]  Straight white men, straight black men, are under attack.
[02:10:56.545 --> 02:11:02.010]  We have become public enemy number one in the eyes of the black media.
[02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:03.491]  Because we're the potential leaders.
[02:11:04.639 --> 02:11:09.567]  Because we are the potential leaders, because we are the ones that can actually protect people from the globalists.
[02:11:09.767 --> 02:11:12.752]  So they have to get us out the box, out the pink, ASAP.
[02:11:13.781 --> 02:11:15.782]  And they're using feminists to do this.
[02:11:16.542 --> 02:11:19.123]  Some guy named Michael Harriot, some writer for The Root.
[02:11:19.183 --> 02:11:24.524]  The Root is the number one perpetrator that is doing this to us.
[02:11:25.004 --> 02:11:30.326]  And they put black men in the line of sight for their firing squad.
[02:11:30.766 --> 02:11:31.446]  It's disgusting.
[02:11:32.006 --> 02:11:38.328]  And that's what, like, you have this one thing now where they say that black men are the white people of black people.
[02:11:39.088 --> 02:11:40.429]  Like, how ridiculous is that?
[02:11:41.449 --> 02:11:41.589]  So,
[02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:45.976]  Now, here I am, along with conservatives, and they're mad.
[02:11:46.096 --> 02:11:50.219]  I'm like, but you just said I was the white people of black people.
[02:11:50.299 --> 02:11:53.641]  How can you be mad now when you already put me in that boat?
[02:11:54.562 --> 02:11:55.883]  So that's just one example.
[02:11:57.104 --> 02:12:00.326]  They have weaponized the black woman against the black man.
[02:12:00.346 --> 02:12:08.051]  They've been doing that since the 50s with the welfare, where in welfare you had to have the man outside of the home in order to reap the benefits.
[02:12:08.661 --> 02:12:13.302]  They are now weaponizing the LGBT movement under the guise of Black Lives Matter.
[02:12:13.342 --> 02:12:15.782]  They have weaponized trans people.
[02:12:16.082 --> 02:12:17.563]  They have weaponized women.
[02:12:17.843 --> 02:12:33.546]  They are going to use the indoctrination centers that we call public schools to weaponize the children and the college students against us as well, to create an implosion of the black community and use democratic policies to siphon power from the black community.
[02:12:33.846 --> 02:12:34.766]  And this is what we're fighting.
[02:12:38.152 --> 02:12:41.563]  I have talked to major rock stars, some of the biggest names out there.
[02:12:41.884 --> 02:12:42.365]  We're told the 90s.
[02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:48.601]  You better start doing gangster rap, and a lot of them tried it, or you're going to be off the air.
[02:12:49.102 --> 02:13:10.788]  And Sumner Redstone and the globalists and the corrupt elements of the CIA are on record funding gangster rap to brand black men as murdering gangster thugs, so they could then make white people hate black men, put black men in prison, and then break down society, just like the cocaine got shipped in with the real Freeway Rick Ross.
[02:13:11.568 --> 02:13:12.289]  And that's a fact.
[02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:18.435]  Now it doesn't mean once they wound up a bunch of black guys being racist drug dealers and thugs just like MS-13 or the KKK.
[02:13:18.715 --> 02:13:20.517]  Doesn't mean they're not some of those groups bad.
[02:13:20.757 --> 02:13:22.819]  But the point is they were manufactured.
[02:13:22.859 --> 02:13:24.241]  They were mind-controlled.
[02:13:24.541 --> 02:13:25.502]  They were turned into that.
[02:13:25.542 --> 02:13:28.545]  So just like I don't like a group of those guys coming after me and my family.
[02:13:28.785 --> 02:13:29.386]  I grew up in Dallas.
[02:13:29.426 --> 02:13:29.946]  I've dealt with it.
[02:13:30.247 --> 02:13:34.071]  That doesn't mean that I don't see the larger picture of the factory that created that.
[02:13:35.595 --> 02:13:38.297]  Yeah, they weaponized VH1 against us.
[02:13:38.357 --> 02:13:39.137]  That's the new one.
[02:13:39.797 --> 02:13:41.919]  With their... Oh, you can see it.
[02:13:41.959 --> 02:13:48.783]  They have all these black people, the MTV Awards and VH1 Awards, talking about whites are bad, whites are scum, we're gonna get you.
[02:13:49.183 --> 02:13:52.045]  That's meant to make white people become racist and hate black people.
[02:13:52.105 --> 02:13:54.026]  It's so damn evil and obvious.
[02:13:54.746 --> 02:13:55.307]  It's crazy!
[02:13:55.367 --> 02:13:55.647]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:56.227 --> 02:14:00.432]  Well, VH1 has created programming that's going to force black people to hate black people.
[02:14:00.512 --> 02:14:02.134]  All you see is black-on-black crime.
[02:14:02.575 --> 02:14:05.438]  So, Hollywood has mobilized... So it's very sophisticated.
[02:14:05.478 --> 02:14:06.159]  How do we stop it?
[02:14:07.256 --> 02:14:08.117]  How do we stop it?
[02:14:08.977 --> 02:14:10.938]  It starts with this right here.
[02:14:11.298 --> 02:14:14.861]  The conversation between HOTEP Jesus and Alex Jones.
[02:14:14.941 --> 02:14:16.622]  That right there is mind-breaking.
[02:14:17.582 --> 02:14:22.705]  It also starts with people who have a large following just tweeting the word HOTEP.
[02:14:22.985 --> 02:14:27.068]  That is going to make the black liberal lose their mind.
[02:14:27.248 --> 02:14:32.311]  You see, when HOTEPs in the black community are empowered, the black community comes back
[02:14:32.851 --> 02:14:33.051]  Yeah.
[02:15:02.551 --> 02:15:03.011]  I don't think so.
[02:15:22.972 --> 02:15:26.255]  And so, we have to be sophisticated enough to get that and understand it.
[02:15:26.495 --> 02:15:27.836]  HOTEP, Jesus, is our guest.
[02:15:27.856 --> 02:15:29.237]  We'll get more on the definition of HOTEP.
[02:15:29.578 --> 02:15:32.801]  It scares the globalists and the leftists and these globalist vampires so much.
[02:15:32.841 --> 02:15:34.902]  On the other side, newswars.com.
[02:15:35.783 --> 02:15:36.884]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:40.888 --> 02:15:45.752]  And then Roger Stone with Big Bombshells is coming up.
[02:15:48.747 --> 02:15:50.649]  Eating jalapeno while Hotep was talking.
[02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:52.051]  Sucked it down to my lungs.
[02:15:52.111 --> 02:15:53.512]  It feels real good right now.
[02:16:05.416 --> 02:16:10.081]  I grew up without a father, and I always spent more time with computers, and so I've always identified.
[02:16:10.181 --> 02:16:13.004]  I grew up in a father's home, just to give you my back, sorry, beep beep.
[02:16:13.785 --> 02:16:15.947]  And I spend a lot of time with computers.
[02:16:16.387 --> 02:16:16.748]  Beep beep.
[02:16:17.168 --> 02:16:19.290]  And I just have a strong connection with them, beep beep.
[02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:20.652]  More so than people.
[02:16:21.352 --> 02:16:25.416]  And mostly even on people, and that's kind of why I'm a computer now.
[02:16:25.436 --> 02:16:26.397]  I identify as a computer.
[02:16:26.417 --> 02:16:27.498]  I don't know if that's okay.
[02:16:27.618 --> 02:16:27.898]  Beep beep.
[02:16:28.198 --> 02:16:32.462]  And if you all think about it, really the human brain is just an advanced CPU processor.
[02:16:32.502 --> 02:16:35.544]  If you think about it, the human brain is just like another computer, right?
[02:16:35.625 --> 02:16:36.806]  Beep beep, just processing things.
[02:16:37.786 --> 02:16:38.146]  So, yeah.
[02:16:38.546 --> 02:16:40.507]  Well, my name is Sven Computer.
[02:16:41.108 --> 02:16:42.308]  My pronouns, I don't really care.
[02:16:42.328 --> 02:16:43.268]  You can call me anything.
[02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:44.909]  Just don't call me Windows 2000.
[02:16:45.069 --> 02:16:47.010]  That would be very offensive.
[02:16:48.851 --> 02:16:51.112]  And that's about it, and I'm a raging ****.
[02:16:55.641 --> 02:16:57.381]  And Steven Crowder is on with us.
[02:16:57.641 --> 02:16:58.442]  Heavily censored.
[02:16:58.742 --> 02:17:01.102]  You've got Twitter, you've got YouTube banning the video.
[02:17:01.122 --> 02:17:02.162]  We just showed you some of it.
[02:17:02.182 --> 02:17:02.642]  Ridiculous.
[02:17:02.943 --> 02:17:06.843]  Leanne, you found his gender from this Gender Fluidity Conference.
[02:17:07.003 --> 02:17:07.964]  I didn't get the name right.
[02:17:08.004 --> 02:17:08.544]  I'm sorry.
[02:17:08.584 --> 02:17:16.485]  Yeah, the Gender Fluidity, which is, you know, that's why they just let this guy in and they hear Sven Computer out because there's so many different genders.
[02:17:16.525 --> 02:17:19.886]  They don't even know, perhaps, there really is this computer gender.
[02:17:20.646 --> 02:17:25.211]  I knew I would find it if I just looked through this list, the complete list of all genders.
[02:17:26.172 --> 02:17:29.935]  And Sven Computer is video gender.
[02:17:30.636 --> 02:17:37.583]  Video gender is a gender that feels too robotic technological to be classified by human standards.
[02:17:38.003 --> 02:17:42.448]  Note, this gender is for the use of any robotic mechanical kin types
[02:17:42.928 --> 02:17:43.268]  Only.
[02:17:43.448 --> 02:17:46.170]  I'm the last guy who wants to get into any of this.
[02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:47.871]  I'm a late-night host and comedian.
[02:17:47.891 --> 02:17:49.992]  I mean, I'm not even, you know, I'm not even a radio guy.
[02:17:50.092 --> 02:17:50.732]  I'm a comedian.
[02:17:50.792 --> 02:17:51.613]  I started out as a comedian.
[02:17:51.833 --> 02:17:52.913]  We do a late-night show.
[02:17:53.153 --> 02:17:55.414]  Really, I grew up my whole life watching early Letterman.
[02:17:55.434 --> 02:17:55.955]  That was me.
[02:17:55.975 --> 02:18:01.778]  My dad used to record on the VHS, so I'd get to watch the top ten list, and he'd fast-forward the too naughty parts, you know?
[02:18:02.038 --> 02:18:10.022]  And I remember then, as I grew up, and I realized that every single one of these people was far, far left, um, and I was, I was going, you know, it'd be great to be able to watch late-night and not get sucker-punched.
[02:18:10.302 --> 02:18:10.643]  That's all.
[02:18:10.663 --> 02:18:11.825]  I don't even want it to be political.
[02:18:12.045 --> 02:18:14.028]  I'd say 80% of our content isn't political.
[02:18:14.168 --> 02:18:15.711]  I'm just open about my views.
[02:18:16.071 --> 02:18:17.574]  It's a late night entertainment show.
[02:18:17.594 --> 02:18:18.836]  I don't want to sue anybody.
[02:18:19.116 --> 02:18:22.882]  I don't want to have to deal with the Twitter police and the YouTube violations.
[02:18:22.922 --> 02:18:25.907]  This was a guy going in as a... I didn't even know that was a gender!
[02:18:26.527 --> 02:18:29.489]  This is very enlightening, but it's hysterical to me.
[02:18:30.630 --> 02:18:34.933]  Probably someone out there could file a class action lawsuit for discriminating against, what was it called?
[02:18:34.953 --> 02:18:35.694]  Video gender?
[02:18:35.714 --> 02:18:36.494]  Video gender.
[02:18:36.594 --> 02:18:45.741]  If you go back, I don't know, 10, 20 years, you go back to Carson, you go, you know they were joking about Nixon, they were joking about what was going on in the culture, you have to joke about what's happening.
[02:18:46.341 --> 02:18:47.562]  This is what's happening now!
[02:18:48.002 --> 02:18:49.902]  LGBTQ2-spirited!
[02:18:50.062 --> 02:18:51.843]  And you couldn't even have Richard Pryor!
[02:18:51.883 --> 02:18:53.363]  You couldn't even have any Murphy today!
[02:18:53.703 --> 02:18:54.584]  You couldn't do anything!
[02:18:54.604 --> 02:18:55.084]  And that's what it is!
[02:18:55.144 --> 02:18:56.124]  It's clogging culture!
[02:18:56.164 --> 02:18:57.025]  It's shutting down speech!
[02:18:57.325 --> 02:18:58.185]  It's dividing everybody!
[02:19:02.126 --> 02:19:04.107]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long!
[02:19:04.207 --> 02:19:04.507]  Go ahead!
[02:19:05.152 --> 02:19:07.014]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:19:07.034 --> 02:19:10.077]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:19:10.898 --> 02:19:12.019]  It just gets old, man.
[02:19:12.319 --> 02:19:14.041]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:19:14.741 --> 02:19:16.843]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:19:17.063 --> 02:19:21.067]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:19:21.087 --> 02:19:23.509]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:19:24.370 --> 02:19:26.691]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:19:27.072 --> 02:19:28.132]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:19:28.412 --> 02:19:29.313]  Us being shut down?
[02:19:29.533 --> 02:19:30.593]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:19:31.014 --> 02:19:32.054]  You know what, Alex?
[02:19:32.074 --> 02:19:33.175]  Put him on pause again.
[02:19:33.195 --> 02:19:34.015]  Hey, Frank!
[02:19:34.295 --> 02:19:39.638]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:44.240]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:47.342]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:19:47.602 --> 02:19:47.982]  You understand?
[02:19:48.082 --> 02:19:49.343]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:19:49.723 --> 02:19:50.824]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:19:51.824 --> 02:19:56.767]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:19:57.688 --> 02:19:58.408]  Do you understand?
[02:19:58.428 --> 02:19:59.769]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:20:06.273 --> 02:20:08.995]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:19.862]  Alright, we got big breaking news and a video clip I'm gonna play.
[02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:36.067]  I remember two years ago when President Trump was president-elect, just about two years ago, and he had one of the heads of the whole Japanese system there, and he was going to get them to invest 50 billion.
[02:20:37.287 --> 02:20:42.769]  And that was the first of the dominoes that have now been several trillion invested here.
[02:20:44.890 --> 02:20:47.872]  And Trump pledged
[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:51.381]  That if you just invest here, we'll have a market with you.
[02:20:51.961 --> 02:20:54.221]  And he knew that Japan had already been investing compared to China.
[02:20:54.281 --> 02:20:56.162]  China invests $23 billion with us on average.
[02:20:56.802 --> 02:20:58.323]  We invest $900 billion in them.
[02:20:59.063 --> 02:21:00.943]  Well, Japan invests hundreds of billions with us.
[02:21:01.963 --> 02:21:03.464]  So SoftBank said $50 billion.
[02:21:03.484 --> 02:21:04.604]  It's now over $100 billion.
[02:21:05.744 --> 02:21:10.086]  And it's good business for Japan as well, but that is hiring tens of thousands of people.
[02:21:11.506 --> 02:21:12.946]  So I was just watching Trump live.
[02:21:12.966 --> 02:21:15.167]  We're going to play a clip of it here, backed up.
[02:21:18.246 --> 02:21:23.411]  Trump at that time, his first job was getting the economy going, would make 500 phone calls a day.
[02:21:24.573 --> 02:21:29.338]  And like, you know, he called my wife up to tell her what a great job I was doing.
[02:21:29.378 --> 02:21:31.880]  I get on the phone, I said, sir, he's still called some since then.
[02:21:32.301 --> 02:21:34.583]  I said, sir, I like you calling, but you don't have to call.
[02:21:34.683 --> 02:21:35.164]  I'm on board.
[02:21:35.184 --> 02:21:36.105]  You know, I know you're busy.
[02:21:36.505 --> 02:21:37.646]  I go, well, what call is this, sir?
[02:21:37.706 --> 02:21:38.187]  He goes, well,
[02:21:39.577 --> 02:21:40.077]  It's like 397.
[02:21:40.117 --> 02:21:43.720]  I said, sir, you can go.
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:49.003]  I mean, but he gets the energy and what he's doing and encouraging people.
[02:21:49.023 --> 02:21:49.783]  That's how he did it.
[02:21:50.504 --> 02:21:52.305]  And it's not like he's virtue signaling.
[02:21:52.985 --> 02:21:58.868]  The African community, human community, is a time bomb the globalists have that they want to control.
[02:21:58.949 --> 02:21:59.829]  We got to fix that.
[02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:02.751]  And, and, and, and, you know,
[02:22:04.448 --> 02:22:05.589]  It's not some virtue signal.
[02:22:05.609 --> 02:22:07.790]  We just can't target black babies and try to kill them.
[02:22:07.850 --> 02:22:14.054]  And that doesn't mean if some brainwashed black thugs or white thugs are trying to attack you because of what color you are, you don't have to beat the hell out of them.
[02:22:14.814 --> 02:22:17.596]  But it does mean we sink to the level of this.
[02:22:17.796 --> 02:22:20.538]  And that's the big picture I'm trying to get at here.
[02:22:20.638 --> 02:22:22.999]  And there's a real awakening to this.
[02:22:23.119 --> 02:22:25.221]  And I'm just thinking about all the things Trump's done in the last two years.
[02:22:26.241 --> 02:22:29.283]  And just everything he's done to not be out to get America.
[02:22:29.303 --> 02:22:30.244]  I want to ask Ho-Tip in a minute.
[02:22:30.844 --> 02:22:35.107]  America's had its problems, but why, undoubtedly, is it targeted by all these evil forces?
[02:22:35.147 --> 02:22:37.709]  Because it has a potential destiny, and they know it.
[02:22:38.170 --> 02:22:38.870]  It's a crossroads.
[02:22:38.890 --> 02:22:40.011]  We're going to talk to Ho-Tip in a minute.
[02:22:40.031 --> 02:22:40.671]  Get him back very soon.
[02:22:40.691 --> 02:22:41.872]  I want him on every week if we can come on.
[02:22:42.673 --> 02:22:43.734]  But here's the president right now.
[02:22:47.977 --> 02:22:51.319]  And Moss Hassan, do you want to talk about another successful guy?
[02:22:51.379 --> 02:22:52.340]  He was in my office.
[02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:53.581]  He said,
[02:22:54.963 --> 02:22:55.964]  A friend of mine set it up.
[02:22:56.625 --> 02:23:02.651]  He said, I want to invest $50 billion in the United States.
[02:23:02.711 --> 02:23:04.773]  I said, you don't mean $50 billion, you mean $50 million.
[02:23:05.594 --> 02:23:06.414]  And that would have been okay.
[02:23:06.434 --> 02:23:09.037]  That would have been worth about a five-minute meeting.
[02:23:10.138 --> 02:23:10.478]  $50 million.
[02:23:10.619 --> 02:23:11.479]  He does those too, yeah.
[02:23:11.860 --> 02:23:13.742]  And so I thought he was saying $50 million.
[02:23:13.762 --> 02:23:16.604]  And when it was set up, it was $50 million, and I wanted to make it quick.
[02:23:17.594 --> 02:23:18.435]  But I heard about him.
[02:23:18.475 --> 02:23:25.203]  He, along with Terry, their best friends, he came out and I said, so good, what are you going to invest in?
[02:23:25.984 --> 02:23:27.006]  He said, yes, we're going to.
[02:23:27.186 --> 02:23:28.968]  I said, you can't do that for 50 million.
[02:23:28.988 --> 02:23:31.111]  He said, no, no, I'm going to invest 50 billion.
[02:23:32.116 --> 02:23:33.836]  And he misrepresented to me.
[02:23:34.757 --> 02:23:37.818]  Because he's represent... I can tell you, he did.
[02:23:38.358 --> 02:23:44.840]  Because he spent much more than $50 billion in the United States.
[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:46.080]  And that was two years ago.
[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:46.840]  It's now $100 billion.
[02:23:47.380 --> 02:23:48.861]  And now they're going to do a lot more.
[02:23:49.301 --> 02:23:50.861]  So I want to thank Masa's son.
[02:23:51.681 --> 02:23:52.882]  Masa, are you back there?
[02:23:52.942 --> 02:23:53.182]  Come.
[02:23:54.324 --> 02:23:56.909]  What's incredible is the Japanese are dialed in.
[02:23:57.490 --> 02:23:59.614]  They've been told don't mess with America by the globalists.
[02:24:04.983 --> 02:24:07.184]  And then now they're like, oh, we can invest there?
[02:24:07.204 --> 02:24:08.344]  Oh, we like America.
[02:24:08.644 --> 02:24:09.945]  Boom, it's all over.
[02:24:10.005 --> 02:24:11.505]  Now the Japanese are 100% lined up with America.
[02:24:11.605 --> 02:24:12.206]  Yeah, fantastic.
[02:24:12.326 --> 02:24:13.646]  And they get it.
[02:24:13.686 --> 02:24:15.247]  That's one of the richest guys in Japan.
[02:24:16.027 --> 02:24:17.407]  So that's what's going on here.
[02:24:17.467 --> 02:24:19.508]  It's just a pro-human celebration.
[02:24:19.788 --> 02:24:22.469]  Trump goes to all these countries, says, we love you, you're beautiful, you're great.
[02:24:22.749 --> 02:24:23.550]  Let's all come together.
[02:24:23.570 --> 02:24:24.090]  And it's real.
[02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:26.572]  I think Donald Trump is the shining light of America.
[02:24:26.612 --> 02:24:27.913]  He's what America has been waiting for
[02:24:46.503 --> 02:24:47.664]  Since I've been alive.
[02:24:47.744 --> 02:24:49.605]  I don't know what America was like before me.
[02:24:49.685 --> 02:24:53.248]  I can only speak from first hand account and first hand account.
[02:24:53.288 --> 02:24:54.629]  He's the realist president.
[02:24:55.490 --> 02:24:58.772]  I would say the first black president that we've seen.
[02:24:58.812 --> 02:25:05.477]  If Donald Trump, if we superimpose Donald Trump's personality onto Barack Obama's body,
[02:25:06.445 --> 02:25:08.487]  Black people would be applauding this man.
[02:25:08.527 --> 02:25:10.748]  They'd say, he's the realest man ever!
[02:25:11.088 --> 02:25:11.929]  We love him!
[02:25:12.249 --> 02:25:12.910]  Blah blah blah blah.
[02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:18.173]  But because it's Donald Trump and the media is controlling minds, he's this demon.
[02:25:19.955 --> 02:25:22.537]  Kind of go back to what you asked me before, like, what can we do?
[02:25:22.557 --> 02:25:26.761]  I think what we're doing is, it's exactly what your show says.
[02:25:27.081 --> 02:25:28.842]  This is Info Wars.
[02:25:28.943 --> 02:25:30.904]  This is media versus media.
[02:25:31.265 --> 02:25:38.130]  So, what we have to do is find media faces like myself, Uncle Hotep, and support these guys.
[02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:39.031]  Oh, I agree.
[02:25:39.291 --> 02:25:39.732]  Exactly.
[02:25:40.132 --> 02:25:42.474]  I'm trying to boost other great people.
[02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:45.431]  Yeah, support Alex Jones.
[02:25:45.791 --> 02:25:49.332]  You know, support whoever your favorite media person is.
[02:25:49.972 --> 02:25:57.714]  Support them financially so we can grow our media outlets and we can battle where the real war is.
[02:25:57.774 --> 02:25:59.654]  And the war is for the mind right now.
[02:26:00.295 --> 02:26:04.876]  And that's a war that we're losing and we have to continue to fight and we have to continue to win.
[02:26:06.156 --> 02:26:11.818]  Without being too confident though, because the wind can change, at your gut level as a dialed-in guy, Hotep,
[02:26:12.964 --> 02:26:16.745]  What worries you at night about this turnaround?
[02:26:16.765 --> 02:26:20.106]  We're starting to see it's far from, you know, 10% done, but beginning.
[02:26:21.287 --> 02:26:23.808]  How could the enemy turn this around against us?
[02:26:27.029 --> 02:26:31.850]  They could try, like Maxine Waters, the violence thing, you know, scaring people.
[02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:33.371]  That's a great tactic.
[02:26:34.511 --> 02:26:37.252]  The Jim Crow tactic of kicking people out of the redhead.
[02:26:37.873 --> 02:26:41.258]  You know, this is what we call, uh, just, it's just really violent.
[02:26:41.358 --> 02:26:43.160]  I'm not sure what the word is I'm looking for here.
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:45.984]  Oh, this whole left thing of bullying people and keeping them off the street?
[02:26:46.064 --> 02:26:46.365]  Yeah.
[02:26:46.385 --> 02:26:47.667]  That's straight up KKK.
[02:26:48.628 --> 02:26:50.050]  It's radicalization.
[02:26:51.454 --> 02:26:53.316]  And I think that's what they're going to try and do.
[02:26:53.336 --> 02:26:55.158]  They're going to try and radicalize this movement.
[02:26:55.218 --> 02:27:03.427]  And they're going to try to make it seem like, kind of like Antifa, where violence is okay, where being a violent revolution is okay.
[02:27:03.467 --> 02:27:05.689]  And it's like, what are you guys revolting about?
[02:27:05.929 --> 02:27:07.431]  You control everything.
[02:27:07.531 --> 02:27:09.854]  So how could you revolt against people
[02:27:10.535 --> 02:27:11.817]  Who built this nation?
[02:27:11.837 --> 02:27:14.000]  Who the Constitution was created for?
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:17.144]  You're resisting the Constitution.
[02:27:17.164 --> 02:27:18.846]  You're resisting the Founding Fathers.
[02:27:19.106 --> 02:27:22.291]  You're resisting the African people that helped build this nation.
[02:27:22.571 --> 02:27:23.772]  You're resisting the people.
[02:27:23.793 --> 02:27:25.615]  That's what I want to make a point.
[02:27:25.655 --> 02:27:27.357]  Hispanics already have the population.
[02:27:28.218 --> 02:27:28.979]  It's your country.
[02:27:29.119 --> 02:27:32.001]  Why would you, if people are part of it, take on the birthright?
[02:27:32.302 --> 02:27:34.083]  And Trump is saying, take your birthright.
[02:27:34.424 --> 02:27:34.724]  Take it.
[02:27:34.904 --> 02:27:39.448]  He was the guy 45 years ago that bought golf courses that blacks and Jews couldn't go to.
[02:27:39.768 --> 02:27:41.590]  That's why black folks are well known for loving him so much.
[02:27:41.610 --> 02:27:42.090]  Exactly.
[02:27:42.390 --> 02:27:43.631]  He's just saying, it's your birthright.
[02:27:43.671 --> 02:27:44.012]  Take it.
[02:27:44.332 --> 02:27:46.093]  And they're saying, no, we don't want the birthright.
[02:27:46.334 --> 02:27:46.874]  We don't want it.
[02:27:46.914 --> 02:27:47.515]  We're not taking it.
[02:27:48.379 --> 02:27:49.159]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:51.320]  That's exactly what's happening here.
[02:27:51.741 --> 02:27:54.942]  But it's just a radicalization is what they're going to do.
[02:27:55.202 --> 02:27:56.163]  They're going to scare people.
[02:27:56.183 --> 02:28:00.424]  So then if it's not that, they're going to try and run a smear campaign with the media.
[02:28:00.444 --> 02:28:02.866]  They're going to try and blackball you.
[02:28:03.146 --> 02:28:05.747]  You know, they write written scathing articles about me.
[02:28:05.807 --> 02:28:06.987]  Solange has tried me.
[02:28:07.368 --> 02:28:09.228]  You know, they're going to do... Which is a good thing.
[02:28:09.248 --> 02:28:10.329]  That shows you're on the right track.
[02:28:11.243 --> 02:28:15.386]  Yeah, they're just trying to defame your character when it comes to the individual.
[02:28:15.626 --> 02:28:22.871]  But for the entire population, it's going to be a radicalization and create like this royal revolution.
[02:28:22.931 --> 02:28:23.831]  Join us every week.
[02:28:23.871 --> 02:28:25.072]  We love the work you're doing, Hotep.
[02:28:25.092 --> 02:28:25.753]  I'll be back.
[02:28:26.073 --> 02:28:27.474]  Hotep is an Egyptian word.
[02:28:28.174 --> 02:28:29.755]  Translates as to be at peace.
[02:28:30.396 --> 02:28:34.759]  We found the names of ancient Egyptian figures such as, and it goes on through that.
[02:28:35.179 --> 02:28:36.340]  And so God bless you, my friend.
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:37.180]  We love the work you're doing.
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:38.761]  We want all empowerment for everybody.
[02:28:39.142 --> 02:28:39.542]  We love it.
[02:28:39.602 --> 02:28:40.743]  So thank you so much, my friend.
[02:28:41.503 --> 02:28:41.983]  God bless.
[02:28:42.023 --> 02:28:42.784]  God bless you, man.
[02:28:42.804 --> 02:28:43.504]  Thank you for having me.
[02:28:43.664 --> 02:28:44.125]  Absolutely.
[02:28:44.165 --> 02:28:44.885]  I'll be back again.
[02:28:45.245 --> 02:28:45.986]  Going to the stars.
[02:28:46.006 --> 02:28:47.507]  It's going to happen.
[02:28:48.207 --> 02:28:50.428]  Our grandkids are going to look back on this and we win this.
[02:28:50.508 --> 02:28:51.809]  It's the greatest time in history.
[02:28:52.249 --> 02:28:52.610]  Very soon.
[02:28:53.130 --> 02:28:55.131]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone with breaking news.
[02:28:55.151 --> 02:28:55.771]  Here goes hotel.
[02:28:55.831 --> 02:28:56.392]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:30:06.857 --> 02:30:09.959]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:30:09.979 --> 02:30:10.520]  You're on the air.
[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:11.060]  Thanks for holding.
[02:30:11.461 --> 02:30:12.561]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:30:12.782 --> 02:30:13.362]  Hey, brother.
[02:30:13.662 --> 02:30:14.022]  Good, man.
[02:30:14.063 --> 02:30:14.863]  Thank you for calling.
[02:30:14.963 --> 02:30:15.524]  Hey, hey.
[02:30:15.604 --> 02:30:20.007]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:30:20.227 --> 02:30:26.592]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:30:26.612 --> 02:30:28.433]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:30:28.534 --> 02:30:34.698]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:30:35.759 --> 02:30:36.940]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.002]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:30:41.402 --> 02:30:43.023]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:30:43.463 --> 02:30:44.204]  And exactly.
[02:30:44.224 --> 02:30:48.446]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:49.066]  Boom!
[02:30:49.226 --> 02:30:52.048]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:30:52.108 --> 02:30:52.628]  It's amazing.
[02:30:52.688 --> 02:30:56.931]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:31:07.885 --> 02:31:13.189]  We acknowledge in this country that we can't, we cannot accept this.
[02:31:13.850 --> 02:31:14.710]  I can't do a whoop.
[02:31:14.871 --> 02:31:15.511]  I'm sorry.
[02:31:15.791 --> 02:31:16.592]  We can't do it.
[02:31:17.372 --> 02:31:27.600]  And the Oscar goes to... What was your response, Phil Mudd?
[02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:28.961]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[02:31:29.262 --> 02:31:31.784]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[02:31:32.124 --> 02:31:33.765]  Well, Trey Gowdy ought to have his a** kicked.
[02:31:36.347 --> 02:31:37.108]  I am a proud
[02:31:40.729 --> 02:31:43.271]  P***holers built this country 110 years ago.
[02:31:43.291 --> 02:31:45.332]  They were called slopers and slant-eyes.
[02:31:47.214 --> 02:31:59.102]  The National Institute of Standards and Technology acknowledged that the World Trade Center Building 7 fell off freefall acceleration for over 100 feet on 9-11, which means it was meeting no resistance for eight stories.
[02:31:59.542 --> 02:32:07.087]  So, sparing me a diatribe about conspiracy theories, can you please give me a straight answer on how you think that's scientifically possible without the use of explosives?
[02:32:10.091 --> 02:32:11.752]  Look, I think we should pass on this question.
[02:32:11.772 --> 02:32:16.814]  If you want to tell me that there's something going on beyond two planes going into the buildings, I never saw anything that suggested it.
[02:32:17.234 --> 02:32:21.495]  That was the most investigated event probably in FBI investigative history.
[02:32:21.876 --> 02:32:23.976]  I just, you know, I don't want to spend time on this question.
[02:32:24.036 --> 02:32:24.917]  I don't think it's valid.
[02:32:38.052 --> 02:32:41.935]  When we call the Chinese man a slant-eye, when we call the man from Guatemala a spick and a wetback, THE F**K, and we call the black man an a*****e. OH HELL NO!
[02:32:41.955 --> 02:32:58.848]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[02:33:06.227 --> 02:33:10.412]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.043 --> 02:33:22.067]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:23.228 --> 02:33:26.931]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:29.133]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.193 --> 02:33:31.315]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[02:33:31.335 --> 02:33:34.617]  They give us our victorious names, like that sellout.
[02:33:34.677 --> 02:33:38.000]  It was covered up since the first day of the JFK assassination.
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:46.847]  A guy that makes me ashamed that he claims he's a Texan, Dan Rather, saying, oh, the presidents of this mean, vicious Wolverine.
[02:33:47.788 --> 02:33:53.130]  Well, that's, that's, that's, we're gonna come up with a t-shirt with that because that's a good thing to be like a Wolverine.
[02:33:53.170 --> 02:33:53.590]  Here it is.
[02:33:54.450 --> 02:33:55.110]  Question, Don.
[02:33:55.190 --> 02:34:08.494]  I think his story, historically, looking at the whole sweep of American history, there were some very nasty periods of incivility in the 1880s, for example, in the 1920s.
[02:34:09.095 --> 02:34:12.676]  But no, I don't think we've ever seen anything completely like this.
[02:34:13.776 --> 02:34:14.717]  Mean as a wolverine!
[02:34:44.156 --> 02:34:47.659]  Trump's pretty nice if you watch his speeches and hear him unless somebody attacks him.
[02:34:47.679 --> 02:34:49.960]  He understands the metaphysical rule of don't attack first.
[02:34:50.841 --> 02:34:56.685]  And then he's doing nothing but delivering on his record to a level that's got my head spinning.
[02:34:57.626 --> 02:35:03.070]  He's got numbers with African-Americans that double what they were for Republicans previously.
[02:35:03.650 --> 02:35:12.097]  We had Jesus Hotep, who's a well-known leader in the black community, and he understands that Trump is making a real
[02:35:13.697 --> 02:35:16.865]  Conscious effort to deploy
[02:35:18.194 --> 02:35:25.420]  Hundreds of billions of dollars of factories and infrastructure and jobs and hotels and ownership into places like Detroit.
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:29.062]  Ford and others are announcing huge new plants, huge new buildings, all of it.
[02:35:29.643 --> 02:35:30.864]  Chevrolet, all of it.
[02:35:31.124 --> 02:35:37.329]  Now, Trump says, though, you've got to get the corrupt Democrat unions out of there, and you've got to stop trying to run all this communism garbage.
[02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:41.472]  But if you want $60 an hour, get out of the way, I'll give it to you.
[02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:44.174]  Because you're going to want to work, you're going to want to take it in your own hands.
[02:35:45.762 --> 02:35:48.244]  Just like he said, I'll give you good Supreme Court justices.
[02:35:48.264 --> 02:35:49.404]  And now he's about to get his second pick.
[02:35:49.424 --> 02:35:51.446]  Just like he said, I'll give you fixing the VA.
[02:35:51.566 --> 02:35:52.206]  It's beginning to happen.
[02:35:52.226 --> 02:35:53.607]  Just like I'll give you securing the borders.
[02:35:53.847 --> 02:35:56.149]  Just like I will get out of your way and give you tax cuts.
[02:35:56.169 --> 02:35:57.970]  And I will begin to abolish Obamacare.
[02:35:58.210 --> 02:35:59.911]  And I will kill the IMF and the World Bank.
[02:35:59.931 --> 02:36:01.452]  I'll get us out of the unelected TPP.
[02:36:01.693 --> 02:36:03.113]  I'll renegotiate NAFTA and GATT.
[02:36:03.394 --> 02:36:11.919]  I will, for 30 years, they've been suppressing all these incredible cures and treatments, which are for the criminally, you know, globalists.
[02:36:11.959 --> 02:36:12.840]  They don't want you to have.
[02:36:14.215 --> 02:36:16.297]  And he's doing everything he said he'd do.
[02:36:16.317 --> 02:36:17.778]  People say, well, how could it be so different?
[02:36:18.118 --> 02:36:24.324]  Because the globalists have a management strategy of suppressing, of feudalism, of not letting the people get it.
[02:36:24.384 --> 02:36:32.471]  So if you want your birthright of Americana and its dream, it was never fully realized, but everybody wanted to come here because it was still the best place ever.
[02:36:32.971 --> 02:36:35.834]  Because that's what good things are made of, is dreams, believing, striving.
[02:36:37.355 --> 02:36:40.278]  If you want that spirit, then you've got to be part of it.
[02:36:41.658 --> 02:36:43.461]  And every evil cockroach is scared.
[02:36:43.481 --> 02:36:46.747]  Now, Roger Stone joins us fresh off the plane with exclusive.
[02:36:46.887 --> 02:36:48.410]  Already, Andrew Napolitano.
[02:36:49.192 --> 02:36:50.113]  We should recap that.
[02:36:50.314 --> 02:36:52.818]  Was told you're the frontrunner by the president.
[02:36:53.695 --> 02:36:55.836]  We're not trying to box the president of Steele's Thunder.
[02:36:55.856 --> 02:36:56.376]  That's a fact.
[02:36:56.956 --> 02:36:57.757]  He'd be the great guy.
[02:36:57.777 --> 02:37:00.498]  You can recap that, but also the hearings today.
[02:37:00.558 --> 02:37:01.638]  Roger Stone being brought up.
[02:37:02.398 --> 02:37:03.399]  We've got Gowdy.
[02:37:03.479 --> 02:37:04.459]  We've got Jordan.
[02:37:04.499 --> 02:37:05.260]  We've got others.
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:11.182]  Get him right in the crosshairs to the current FBI director and Rosenstein, the president of the country, he thinks.
[02:37:11.862 --> 02:37:20.546]  Catching him in huge lies about there's no investigation before June 2016 and not knowing about the dossier and not threatening staffers of Jordan.
[02:37:21.346 --> 02:37:21.586]  I don't
[02:37:40.023 --> 02:37:42.664]  And the New York Times are saying, OK, get ready to be disappointed.
[02:37:43.124 --> 02:37:49.047]  It looks like they're at least talking about shutting down the fake Russiagate because Gowdy said you're killing America.
[02:37:49.087 --> 02:37:50.147]  This is an attack on America.
[02:37:50.708 --> 02:37:52.168]  Or are they feigning that?
[02:37:52.268 --> 02:37:52.908]  Is it a feint?
[02:37:53.669 --> 02:37:55.650]  And they're going to come back with their left hand with a dagger.
[02:37:56.130 --> 02:37:58.451]  Again, I just want to move past that to begin.
[02:38:00.359 --> 02:38:15.710]  Prosecuting them, and not that I've got a vendetta, but Hillary and people like this are not going to go away, in my view, until they're given free helicopter rides out into the ocean to whatever island they want to go to to live happily ever after.
[02:38:16.570 --> 02:38:17.771]  So, you know, that's my view.
[02:38:18.652 --> 02:38:20.353]  So, Roger, thanks for joining us.
[02:38:22.234 --> 02:38:23.836]  Alex, that beard is looking really good.
[02:38:23.856 --> 02:38:26.637]  I like the whole Abraham Lincoln thing.
[02:38:26.677 --> 02:38:27.118]  It's working.
[02:38:27.901 --> 02:38:31.044]  I may have to cut it, though, because, I mean, the ladies, they do like it.
[02:38:31.064 --> 02:38:32.626]  I don't wonder men grow these things.
[02:38:32.706 --> 02:38:38.492]  It's like, I mean, you know, women had never shown any interest to me in my life until I grew this beard, and now it's much worse.
[02:38:40.854 --> 02:38:44.478]  So, look, there's so much news here, it's hard to know where to start.
[02:38:45.019 --> 02:38:47.862]  The New York Times broke a story only hours ago that
[02:38:48.664 --> 02:38:55.067]  Andrew Miller, a former associate of mine, essentially my wingman for a number of years.
[02:38:55.107 --> 02:38:58.468]  Now let's be clear, you off-record for months have been telling me they were grilling him and everything.
[02:38:58.728 --> 02:39:01.869]  We didn't want to say it yet and flush him out to do this, but now we can talk about it.
[02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:08.412]  Well, they have subpoenaed him, Mr. Muller has, but the story is not the subpoena.
[02:39:08.812 --> 02:39:14.174]  The story is his motion to quash, which I understand will be based on the legal opinion
[02:39:14.858 --> 02:39:18.223]  of Professor Stephen Calabresi of Northwestern University.
[02:39:25.888 --> 02:39:31.049]  This is the case that Paul Manafort, in my opinion, should have filed, but didn't.
[02:39:31.669 --> 02:39:34.950]  So, Miller has not worked for me for three years.
[02:39:35.490 --> 02:39:36.251]  He's a good man.
[02:39:36.271 --> 02:39:41.152]  He was a traveling aide for Governor Gary Johnson in the 2012 campaign.
[02:39:41.612 --> 02:39:46.933]  He is a registered libertarian, supported the Johnson-Wells ticket in 2016.
[02:39:47.433 --> 02:39:51.014]  He did come to the Republican National Convention to help us out.
[02:39:51.114 --> 02:39:52.275]  You met him there, Alex.
[02:39:52.295 --> 02:39:53.315]  He was there for a week.
[02:39:54.245 --> 02:39:55.826]  Let me correct you.
[02:39:55.866 --> 02:39:57.467]  I was conflating it with the other aid.
[02:39:58.167 --> 02:39:58.507]  Sorry.
[02:40:00.048 --> 02:40:17.658]  But the real question is, and we have known that they were seeking to question him, the real question is, why would you want to speak with someone who didn't work for me at all, except for the one week period of the National Convention, during 2016, during the presidential campaign?
[02:40:18.118 --> 02:40:21.780]  So it's very odd, and I think it demonstrates what we have said all along.
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:23.461]  This is a witch hunt.
[02:40:24.205 --> 02:40:26.987]  They are examining me for any extraneous offense.
[02:40:44.982 --> 02:40:57.129]  Yeah, it was really quite extraordinary.
[02:40:57.149 --> 02:40:59.811]  I was able to look at it very quickly, at least snatches of it.
[02:41:00.211 --> 02:41:06.675]  Look, if the president ever had the reason, the grounds for firing Rosenstein, it is right now.
[02:41:06.895 --> 02:41:11.558]  He is ignoring a demand of a co-equal branch of government.
[02:41:12.199 --> 02:41:17.501]  Asked directly, what can you tell us about the FBI informant who was sent to see Roger Stone?
[02:41:17.881 --> 02:41:18.301]  Nothing.
[02:41:18.721 --> 02:41:23.923]  What can you tell us about the FBI informant who was sent to see Michael Caputo?
[02:41:24.263 --> 02:41:24.623]  Nothing.
[02:41:24.904 --> 02:41:32.986]  What bothers me, Alex, is their informant, who has a history of violent gun crime in the past, has gone missing.
[02:41:33.507 --> 02:41:34.627]  They can't find him.
[02:41:35.347 --> 02:41:36.788]  Is he coming after my family?
[02:41:36.808 --> 02:41:38.068]  I don't know.
[02:41:38.488 --> 02:41:39.949]  I'm deeply concerned about that.
[02:41:40.526 --> 02:41:53.770]  How is he even in the country with that kind of... Let's be clear, he's a convicted guy of violent crimes, a Russian operative that uses fake Western names, who they tried to breadcrumb you with, and then now he's missing.
[02:41:54.150 --> 02:41:56.571]  Yeah, he looks like quite a hombre.
[02:41:57.692 --> 02:42:02.033]  Yeah, look, I have a legitimate concern that he's going to come after my family.
[02:42:02.253 --> 02:42:04.054]  I know Michael Caputo feels the same way.
[02:42:04.074 --> 02:42:07.535]  Well, what did I advise you four weeks ago, in person, is it?
[02:42:09.264 --> 02:42:11.386]  Move to Austin, Texas and go to a safe house.
[02:42:11.826 --> 02:42:12.546]  Oh, wait a minute.
[02:42:12.606 --> 02:42:13.667]  And then I would raise you the money.
[02:42:14.207 --> 02:42:16.429]  Roger, we need to get you moving around.
[02:42:16.449 --> 02:42:17.450]  Let me tell you something.
[02:42:17.470 --> 02:42:19.331]  They already tried to kill you, okay?
[02:42:19.411 --> 02:42:21.192]  And believe me, I've got sources.
[02:42:21.232 --> 02:42:22.814]  They want you dead to pin it all on.
[02:42:23.194 --> 02:42:24.475]  You knew this a year and a half ago.
[02:42:24.895 --> 02:42:28.437]  And the fact that you're still at your house and all the rest of it is just you're asking for it.
[02:42:28.898 --> 02:42:33.141]  And I get you gotta fly around and stuff, but man, I would book flights last minute.
[02:42:33.221 --> 02:42:33.981]  I would do everything.
[02:42:34.001 --> 02:42:35.342]  Because let me tell you, they are 100% willing to
[02:42:36.463 --> 02:42:38.224]  I'm gonna shoot you.
[02:42:38.244 --> 02:42:39.584]  They want to kill you dead in a hammer.
[02:42:39.624 --> 02:42:41.165]  And I know your wife would like to hear that, but it's the truth.
[02:42:41.185 --> 02:42:42.365]  So, she'll be glad I'm telling you.
[02:42:42.605 --> 02:42:43.926]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:43.946 --> 02:42:45.246]  We've got to raise money for Roger, though.
[02:42:45.266 --> 02:42:45.927]  They're trying to bankrupt him.
[02:42:45.967 --> 02:42:46.267]  Us, too.
[02:42:46.307 --> 02:42:47.067]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:42:47.727 --> 02:42:48.327]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:48.387 --> 02:42:50.348]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:42:50.368 --> 02:42:51.829]  Tomorrow's news of the day.
[02:42:51.849 --> 02:42:52.889]  The new Supreme Court nominee.
[02:42:52.909 --> 02:42:53.589]  You heard it here first.
[02:42:54.030 --> 02:42:54.930]  And a lot more straight ahead.
[02:43:02.662 --> 02:43:09.911]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:43:10.312 --> 02:43:17.861]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:43:18.242 --> 02:43:21.325]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:43:21.946 --> 02:43:26.208]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:43:26.589 --> 02:43:30.491]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:43:30.711 --> 02:43:33.432]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:43:33.872 --> 02:43:38.055]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:43:38.635 --> 02:43:41.656]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:43:42.096 --> 02:43:56.921]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.

[02:45:30.882 --> 02:45:32.063]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:45:35.904 --> 02:45:36.405]  Let's go!
[02:45:37.833 --> 02:45:37.993]  Come on!

[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:08.248]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:28.939 --> 02:47:33.343]  I'm going to lay it out right now to listeners.
[02:47:33.784 --> 02:47:38.448]  I'm going to shoot you straight.
[02:47:39.810 --> 02:47:45.175]  When I sit up here on air and I say InfoWars is the front line with the tip of the spear, it's the truth.
[02:47:47.802 --> 02:47:55.911]  When I tell you that what we cover here more than anywhere else, because imagine the amount of truth that's here every day compared to Fox News, and I'm not knocking Fox, it's at least pro-America somewhat.
[02:47:55.931 --> 02:47:59.535]  A year ago it was trying to go the other way, but that failed, management changed, and it's back on track.
[02:48:00.175 --> 02:48:01.917]  InfoWars, other than like DrudgeReport.com.
[02:48:03.235 --> 02:48:08.560]  And Hannity, to some extent, is the only place that the real talking points are getting out.
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:16.808]  So, when Roger Stone talks about they're coming after him and he's got cars T-boning him, he's getting shot in the back with polonium darts, I've seen the medical records.
[02:48:18.089 --> 02:48:25.655]  When we're talking about they're coming after us, George Soros is suing us, there's hundreds of articles this month saying the war against Alex Jones, the war to shut down the press.
[02:48:25.955 --> 02:48:30.258]  They filed amicus briefs saying we want to end the First Amendment, it's a bad idea.
[02:48:30.879 --> 02:48:36.683]  And the Democrats point at Trump and say he's overthrowing the Constitution when the Supreme Court ruled he's dead on because he is.
[02:48:38.004 --> 02:48:39.445]  So, we are Americana.
[02:48:40.826 --> 02:48:47.572]  We want prosperity for you and your family, but if you don't recognize that we're not up here going, oh, we're really important, oh,
[02:48:48.643 --> 02:48:49.363]  We're under attack.
[02:48:49.404 --> 02:48:50.564]  Without you, we're going to go down.
[02:48:51.705 --> 02:48:53.246]  It's like the Alamo, Colonel Travis.
[02:48:53.747 --> 02:48:58.250]  When he knows 8,000 Mexican troops are coming, he's got 180-something men and a couple women.
[02:48:58.790 --> 02:49:02.573]  And he says, victory or death, if you don't get here, I think we'll be dead in a week.
[02:49:02.593 --> 02:49:03.033]  But that's OK.
[02:49:03.053 --> 02:49:05.355]  We're going to stand up and buy you time and get ready.
[02:49:05.435 --> 02:49:06.595]  I think we'll kill a couple thousand.
[02:49:06.615 --> 02:49:07.756]  They're going to be on their way up to you.
[02:49:09.097 --> 02:49:13.940]  Take care of my little boy that my family raised at Gonzales.
[02:49:14.929 --> 02:49:19.293]  But the whole point is that it's not like he's a loser, he's a winner.
[02:49:19.853 --> 02:49:26.098]  He knows a tyrant that's hating on his own country's coming, who's taking all the tax money and trying to take the guns, trying to take the land people paid for.
[02:49:26.679 --> 02:49:27.199]  He's coming.
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:30.702]  And 30% of the folks that were in the Alamo were Mexicans.
[02:49:30.722 --> 02:49:32.984]  They didn't want to be under Santa Ana dictator.
[02:49:33.164 --> 02:49:34.525]  They wanted the land they had and their guns.
[02:49:35.146 --> 02:49:36.927]  You think Santa Ana would let the average Mexican have a gun?
[02:49:37.168 --> 02:49:37.268]  No.
[02:49:38.251 --> 02:49:48.347]  And if I was at that same spot today, knowing this army, estimated to be 8,000, which it was, was coming to kill me, but I knew that I had to buy time, be an example for people, I would do it.
[02:49:48.968 --> 02:49:50.730]  Because there's things big in this universe.
[02:49:50.850 --> 02:49:52.773]  Now, I'm not saying we're going down that road, but...
[02:49:53.919 --> 02:49:54.920]  Travis asked for the help.
[02:49:55.380 --> 02:49:57.142]  Travis asked for the... He wrote the letter.
[02:49:58.003 --> 02:50:00.165]  And by the time it got to him, the Alamo had already fallen.
[02:50:00.745 --> 02:50:02.627]  The point is, we're going to see this through.
[02:50:02.647 --> 02:50:03.988]  Everybody knows it metaphysically.
[02:50:04.048 --> 02:50:05.229]  The enemy Soros knows.
[02:50:05.469 --> 02:50:06.850]  Soros knows at a spiritual level.
[02:50:07.891 --> 02:50:10.113]  It's not even some macho thing that I want to die.
[02:50:10.133 --> 02:50:10.814]  I don't want to die.
[02:50:10.974 --> 02:50:11.655]  I want to win.
[02:50:11.755 --> 02:50:16.319]  And if I have to die for humanity to win, to ensure the big victory, then I'm all about it.
[02:50:17.079 --> 02:50:20.703]  I just want to judiciously use my energy, my blood, my intellect to crush them.
[02:50:21.934 --> 02:50:25.375]  And it's like we're a ship, and we've got sails, and we're going to ram the enemy.
[02:50:25.455 --> 02:50:31.176]  And when you support us financially, or spread our articles, our videos, our material, and realize it's the forbidden information.
[02:50:31.196 --> 02:50:34.697]  The most suppressed stuff out there in congressional hearings is Alex Jones, Paul Watson.
[02:50:35.337 --> 02:50:36.337]  That's what comes up in the hearings.
[02:50:36.377 --> 02:50:38.778]  They want it in the Veritas videos.
[02:50:38.838 --> 02:50:39.638]  What is it about it?
[02:50:39.878 --> 02:50:40.598]  It's the spirit.
[02:50:41.318 --> 02:50:42.158]  It's the reality.
[02:50:42.218 --> 02:50:42.838]  It's the truth.
[02:50:43.058 --> 02:50:43.859]  It's the commitment.
[02:50:43.959 --> 02:50:45.099]  They know.
[02:50:46.039 --> 02:50:47.100]  That we've got their number.
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.241]  And they want Roger's silence so they can destroy him.
[02:50:49.521 --> 02:50:51.682]  They're suing him, the former president, all of them.
[02:50:52.182 --> 02:50:53.823]  And he gets them thrown out, they file more.
[02:50:53.843 --> 02:50:55.944]  And you're like, well then they'll keep... No, they're going to run out soon.
[02:50:56.524 --> 02:50:57.964]  They're already... So, I'm just telling you.
[02:50:58.825 --> 02:50:59.945]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:51:00.466 --> 02:51:00.886]  Go there.

[02:51:14.627 --> 02:51:18.791]  If you're a wealthy person, I love how wealthy folks sit on the fence thinking they got ahead that way.
[02:51:18.811 --> 02:51:21.113]  Well, maybe in past seasons, not in this cycle.
[02:51:21.753 --> 02:51:25.336]  You don't get off the fence, now you're asking for it.
[02:51:26.017 --> 02:51:28.719]  So, if you're wealthy, give a $1,000 donation.
[02:51:29.099 --> 02:51:30.280]  If you're not, give a $10 donation.
[02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:34.824]  People are like, I'm not really doing too well, I got a paycheck very small, all I gave was $5.
[02:51:34.864 --> 02:51:39.528]  Your $5, like the widows might, is more important than some millionaire
[02:51:40.458 --> 02:51:42.681]  You know, that, and I love these millionaires and millionaires.
[02:51:42.821 --> 02:51:45.365]  They've called me over the years, some of them fighting at some of the groups you see today.
[02:51:45.385 --> 02:51:47.788]  They're like, well, where we want you to do this certain agenda.
[02:51:48.849 --> 02:51:49.690]  And it's always a test.
[02:51:49.730 --> 02:51:51.413]  I'm like, sorry, I can't control myself.
[02:51:51.473 --> 02:51:53.255]  I can't shine on to your agenda.
[02:51:53.796 --> 02:51:55.018]  If you like what we're doing, give us money.
[02:51:55.238 --> 02:51:56.179]  But it's never big money.
[02:51:56.219 --> 02:51:58.002]  It's always little people giving us money.
[02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:02.241]  So you can donate, ladies and gentlemen, to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:52:02.261 --> 02:52:02.941]  There's links there.
[02:52:02.961 --> 02:52:04.681]  There's a lot of places for you to donate.
[02:52:04.741 --> 02:52:15.603]  But the bottom line is, if you believe in what we're doing, and you want to see it continue, you want to hear about next year's news before anybody else hears it, you want to stand against globalists, and you want to be part of history, now is the time.
[02:52:16.223 --> 02:52:24.525]  So Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139, or StoneDefenseFund.com, because this is it.
[02:52:24.785 --> 02:52:27.046]  I mean, turn on the hearings.
[02:52:27.686 --> 02:52:28.506]  It's Roger Stone.
[02:52:29.366 --> 02:52:30.787]  Go to the Southern Primary Law Center.
[02:52:30.827 --> 02:52:32.047]  It's Get Alex Jones.
[02:52:32.948 --> 02:52:35.029]  And people are like, well, you're a dumbass going up against them.
[02:52:35.089 --> 02:52:35.349]  No.
[02:52:36.289 --> 02:52:40.351]  If I was a man, I mean, I never went and got my inheritance.
[02:52:40.371 --> 02:52:41.392]  I'm going to go back to Roger in a minute.
[02:52:41.932 --> 02:52:44.473]  I never went and got my inheritance.
[02:52:44.533 --> 02:52:45.554]  And it's quite substantial.
[02:52:45.674 --> 02:52:52.477]  Everybody else in the family, Texas had some land, had some things, had some this or that, had some businesses, had some gas, had some oil.
[02:52:53.317 --> 02:52:56.759]  And I remember saying, no, I don't want my inheritance.
[02:52:57.239 --> 02:52:59.100]  You don't have to sell that land and give me money.
[02:52:59.120 --> 02:53:09.645]  I don't want to go live in a fancy house and have a trophy wife and then not work and go to the Rotary Club and act powerful and go to the golf course and be some candy ass like some distant family members, people I know.
[02:53:10.025 --> 02:53:12.787]  I want to build everything myself because then it's mine and has value.
[02:53:13.467 --> 02:53:27.296]  But that's the whole point of this thing, is that it's you making the right decision and there's all these wealthy people that are sitting on the fence when Donald Trump's lost a billion dollars in this whole fight for us because he realized he'd lose it all if he didn't.
[02:53:28.226 --> 02:53:29.287]  Trump loved America.
[02:53:29.327 --> 02:53:30.168]  He loved prosperity.
[02:53:31.249 --> 02:53:32.049]  It's not out of greed.
[02:53:32.089 --> 02:53:41.137]  It's out of love that he sacrificed all this and put it all on the line because he couldn't believe that people hated it so much and wanted to screw it away for no reason as a pissing contest.
[02:53:41.598 --> 02:53:44.760]  Well, now you've got a chance when we're already winning, winning, winning, winning.
[02:53:44.941 --> 02:53:55.690]  The tables are hot to jump in and tell your neighbors you support Trump, to tell your neighbors you support Infowars, to tell your neighbors you gave $1,000 to Alex Jones or Roger Stone, to filter your damn kids' water.
[02:53:56.210 --> 02:53:57.432]  And fund us.
[02:53:57.492 --> 02:53:59.494]  It's everything I do is a 360 win.
[02:53:59.854 --> 02:54:01.796]  I don't do anything that doesn't help people.
[02:54:01.977 --> 02:54:03.078]  Because let me tell you something right now.
[02:54:03.378 --> 02:54:04.499]  I gauge it all in my spirit.
[02:54:05.020 --> 02:54:10.726]  If it isn't in line with God, and with God fearing, and if it hurts somebody else, I don't push it.
[02:54:11.207 --> 02:54:15.772]  Because I'm not going to dirty my spiritual future for any other person.
[02:54:17.076 --> 02:54:24.652]  And I don't want to dirty the future of my children and their children, where the globalists will take control, and brainwash them, and destroy them, and then steal their souls.
[02:54:24.712 --> 02:54:26.656]  This is what this is, these vampires!
[02:54:27.773 --> 02:54:40.721]  These damned to hell pieces of crap, if you don't double down now, forget the money, if you don't go out and hold out a sign and support free speech and the Second Amendment, or Trump, if you don't put some flesh in the game, you are damned to Hades and you are a servant of evil.
[02:54:41.302 --> 02:54:46.225]  So I'm telling you right now, decide which side you're on, and all of you out there on the fence, get off the fence!
[02:54:46.505 --> 02:54:54.410]  Join Hillary and the globalists and Michael Moore and Rosenstein and all the globalists, or join us!
[02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:56.952]  Stop sitting there on the sideline!
[02:54:57.572 --> 02:54:58.112]  Roger Stone.
[02:55:00.054 --> 02:55:02.155]  Alex, you couldn't have said it any better.
[02:55:02.235 --> 02:55:06.698]  I just came back from New Orleans and I ran into a lot of Info Warriors on the streets.
[02:55:07.319 --> 02:55:11.762]  But they would all ask me, are things really as dire as you and Alex keep saying they are?
[02:55:12.282 --> 02:55:14.144]  Folks, we're not exaggerating at all.
[02:55:14.524 --> 02:55:19.507]  These multi-million dollar lawsuits are designed to close Info Wars down.
[02:55:19.547 --> 02:55:21.869]  And if you just get off the bench, we crush them.
[02:55:22.249 --> 02:55:23.130]  All I want is the victory.
[02:55:24.838 --> 02:55:30.861]  They intend to try to jack me up on some frame, try to get me to testify against the president.
[02:55:31.201 --> 02:55:31.961]  Not happening.
[02:55:32.241 --> 02:55:39.684]  They intend to get InfoWars off of YouTube, off of Facebook, off of Twitter, close us down, shutter the place.
[02:55:40.044 --> 02:55:42.185]  That's what they want because we're the cutting edge.
[02:55:42.585 --> 02:55:44.986]  They can't stand the truth that we're delivering.
[02:55:45.595 --> 02:55:46.716]  That's why we need your help.
[02:55:46.996 --> 02:55:48.397]  There's no exaggeration here.
[02:55:48.697 --> 02:55:50.898]  We're not hyping this to get your dollars.
[02:55:51.218 --> 02:55:52.739]  We're calling on you because we need your help.
[02:55:52.759 --> 02:55:53.960]  We're giving you a decision.
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:56:01.664]  You either spiritually, psychically, financially support us, or just consciously know the enemy's winning.
[02:56:03.045 --> 02:56:04.726]  And by the way, I'm not even complaining.
[02:56:04.766 --> 02:56:05.607]  Whatever happens, happens.
[02:56:05.807 --> 02:56:06.907]  And we're getting a lot of great support.
[02:56:07.328 --> 02:56:09.269]  I just want folks to know that we tend to be so confident.
[02:56:09.609 --> 02:56:12.871]  We don't let people understand the level of the game we're at here, Roger.
[02:56:14.250 --> 02:56:18.493]  I don't know what others will choose to do, Alex, but I know what you will do, and I know what I will do.
[02:56:18.773 --> 02:56:22.036]  I will fight to the bitter end, but I can't do it alone.
[02:56:22.356 --> 02:56:24.998]  We need the folks out there to get on board and help.
[02:56:25.358 --> 02:56:27.760]  They threatened to bankrupt me and destroy my family.
[02:56:28.140 --> 02:56:29.821]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:56:30.202 --> 02:56:34.925]  They threatened to close Alex Jones' entire operation in Infowars down.
[02:56:35.365 --> 02:56:36.886]  Take us off of the net.
[02:56:37.007 --> 02:56:38.327]  Nothing would make them happier.
[02:56:38.728 --> 02:56:39.608]  That is their goal.
[02:56:39.668 --> 02:56:42.951]  They admit we are the beta test to ban and end the whole web.
[02:56:45.140 --> 02:56:46.542]  So, the time is now.
[02:56:46.802 --> 02:56:48.204]  People need to choose sides.
[02:56:48.584 --> 02:56:51.367]  If good people don't step forward, this fight will be lost.
[02:56:51.688 --> 02:56:57.435]  But if people come together behind our message of freedom, if they will stand with us, we will prevail.
[02:56:57.455 --> 02:56:58.856]  They're on the run right now.
[02:56:59.257 --> 02:57:00.178]  They're in retreat.
[02:57:00.518 --> 02:57:07.402]  And now with Trump having another Supreme Court nomination, Trump derangement syndrome is going to reach an even higher level.
[02:57:07.422 --> 02:57:08.923]  And I want to explain that paradox.
[02:57:08.963 --> 02:57:16.228]  We're having big victories, but we can't underestimate the undercurrent of the enemy and how they're going to lash out then at main attack guns.
[02:57:16.688 --> 02:57:22.412]  I mean, imagine, like, they see Roger and myself, others as main guns, which we are, because you're the audience, you're the real power.
[02:57:23.192 --> 02:57:25.333]  And so they're gunning for everything right now.
[02:57:25.714 --> 02:57:27.955]  So support your local TV and radio stations as well.
[02:57:28.255 --> 02:57:29.696]  And be proud you're under attack.
[02:57:29.736 --> 02:57:31.997]  Be proud that you're actually on the winning side.
[02:57:32.037 --> 02:57:37.500]  Back in two minutes, final statements from Roger Stone, then Lionel, former prosecutor and expert on a lot of this is coming up.
[02:57:38.321 --> 02:57:39.401]  This is an incredible time.
[02:57:39.482 --> 02:57:40.102]  Roger Stone.
[02:57:40.302 --> 02:57:41.503]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:57:41.523 --> 02:57:42.443]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:57:42.843 --> 02:57:43.824]  InfoWars.com.
[02:57:43.844 --> 02:57:47.626]  And listen, all of you that already donated and bought products, God bless you.
[02:57:47.646 --> 02:57:48.547]  You've already come this far.
[02:57:48.787 --> 02:57:50.148]  I'm just saying, some of you, get off the bench.
[02:57:57.575 --> 02:58:02.859]  We acknowledge in this country that we can't, we cannot accept this.
[02:58:03.539 --> 02:58:04.400]  I can't do a whoop.
[02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:05.200]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:06.281]  We can't do it.
[02:58:06.881 --> 02:58:07.382]  Whoops.
[02:58:10.524 --> 02:58:17.288]  And the Oscar goes to... What was your response, Phil Mudd?
[02:58:17.328 --> 02:58:18.649]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[02:58:18.949 --> 02:58:21.451]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[02:58:21.831 --> 02:58:23.432]  Well, Tariq Ghali ought to have his a** kicked.
[02:58:26.019 --> 02:58:27.903]  I am a proud s**tholer.
[02:58:30.207 --> 02:58:32.952]  S**tholers built this country 110 years ago.
[02:58:32.972 --> 02:58:34.996]  They were called slopers and slant eyes.
[02:58:38.513 --> 02:58:48.797]  The National Institute of Standards and Technology acknowledged that the World Trade Center Building 7 fell off freefall acceleration for over 100 feet on 9-11, which means it was meeting no resistance for eight stories.
[02:58:49.237 --> 02:58:56.780]  So, sparing me a diatribe about conspiracy theories, can you please give me a straight answer on how you think that's scientifically possible without the use of explosives?
[02:58:59.784 --> 02:59:01.446]  Look, I think we should pass on this question.
[02:59:01.466 --> 02:59:06.511]  If you want to tell me that there's something going on beyond two planes going into buildings, I never saw anything that suggested it.
[02:59:06.932 --> 02:59:11.176]  That was the most investigated event probably in FBI investigative history.
[02:59:11.196 --> 02:59:13.679]  I just, you know, I don't want to spend time on this question.
[02:59:13.739 --> 02:59:14.600]  I don't think it's valid.
[02:59:27.725 --> 02:59:31.529]  When we call the Chinese man a slant-eye, when we call the man from Guatemala a spick and a wetback, THE F**K, and we call the black man an a*****e. OH HELL NO!
[02:59:31.549 --> 02:59:48.507]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[02:59:55.933 --> 03:00:16.928]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:17.968 --> 03:00:24.193]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:45.759 --> 03:00:46.860]  History's repeating itself.
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:49.142]  Right at the 11th hour.
[03:00:49.202 --> 03:00:50.042]  Liberty's coming back.
[03:00:51.603 --> 03:00:53.265]  Roger, the big Supreme Court issue.
[03:00:53.305 --> 03:00:54.305]  So much more that's going down.
[03:00:54.325 --> 03:00:55.386]  But you mentioned Phil Mudd.
[03:00:56.447 --> 03:00:58.328]  Used to run counter-terrorism operations.
[03:00:58.368 --> 03:01:01.050]  He was a CIA infiltrator of the left.
[03:01:01.471 --> 03:01:03.913]  Brought in by Mueller to try to spy on the FBI.
[03:01:03.953 --> 03:01:04.753]  He's a really bad dude.
[03:01:04.773 --> 03:01:06.074]  He's always called the President's death.
[03:01:06.675 --> 03:01:07.635]  I'm not a macho guy.
[03:01:07.675 --> 03:01:09.397]  You know, I don't talk about stuff that I won't back up.
[03:01:10.728 --> 03:01:14.171]  Phil Mudd's talking about killing the President and how we need to be violent and all this crap.
[03:01:14.631 --> 03:01:19.995]  At a certain point, and the Justice Department doesn't have the will to indict him, this is a war.
[03:01:20.055 --> 03:01:29.122]  He's an enemy combatant at this point, and I don't know why different defense intelligence, Marine Corps intelligence, the Army, why they're sitting back while Mudd does this.
[03:01:31.203 --> 03:01:32.664]  It's really quite extraordinary.
[03:01:32.784 --> 03:01:40.130]  If you said that you were going to kill Barack Obama, I think you'd have a visit from the Secret Service within hours, if not minutes.
[03:01:40.979 --> 03:01:43.281]  But there's a double standard here.
[03:01:43.941 --> 03:01:48.144]  This guy openly threatened to kill the President of the United States in a TV interview.
[03:01:49.205 --> 03:01:49.985]  Where's the outrage?
[03:01:50.025 --> 03:01:51.166]  And he's still doing it.
[03:01:51.226 --> 03:01:52.507]  He's saying we're going to take him out.
[03:01:52.587 --> 03:01:55.049]  So I like, as a citizen, I feel derelict.
[03:01:56.050 --> 03:01:59.052]  I'm not going to do this, but I feel like getting in a car and going to Virginia, man.
[03:01:59.072 --> 03:01:59.772]  That's my president.
[03:01:59.792 --> 03:02:00.453]  That's my country.
[03:02:00.473 --> 03:02:03.235]  If everybody else is going to stand down, mud, you better watch your ass.
[03:02:04.275 --> 03:02:06.636]  Well, now you sound a little bit like John Brennan.
[03:02:06.856 --> 03:02:12.700]  Look, this is unbelievable that he can get away with this, but it just shows you the media double standard.
[03:02:12.740 --> 03:02:14.361]  Well, I'm not saying I'm doing anything to Mudd.
[03:02:14.741 --> 03:02:18.463]  You got a guy on TV saying he's going to overthrow the government, he's going to kill the president.
[03:02:18.863 --> 03:02:25.547]  I'm just saying, I mean, I've had people threaten my family and stuff.
[03:02:25.567 --> 03:02:26.087]  I've sued them.
[03:02:26.127 --> 03:02:28.469]  I mean, you know, a bully said, I'm going to kick your ass.
[03:02:28.489 --> 03:02:29.449]  I met him out in the playground.
[03:02:29.529 --> 03:02:30.530]  I just don't understand it.
[03:02:32.291 --> 03:02:34.052]  It is a little hard to fathom.
[03:02:34.714 --> 03:02:42.796]  I do think the big news though, and we were ahead of this curve here on InfoWarp, is the retirement of Justice Kennedy.
[03:02:43.296 --> 03:02:49.237]  Now, I reported late last year that Kennedy was next to go, rather than Ginsburg.
[03:02:49.297 --> 03:03:00.499]  But ironically, with the appointment of Judge Gorsuch, who had been a clerk for Kennedy, and for whom Kennedy had some affinity on a personal basis,
[03:03:01.021 --> 03:03:06.503]  Kennedy decided to stay around on the bench for a little longer because I think he enjoyed that relationship.
[03:03:07.043 --> 03:03:14.265]  Now, consistent with our prediction, Judge Kennedy, a Reagan appointee, will retire.
[03:03:14.745 --> 03:03:18.546]  Now, I believe Judge Andrew Napolitano is a frontrunner.
[03:03:19.046 --> 03:03:24.748]  We know he was the emotional first pick of the president for the Gorsuch seat.
[03:03:25.208 --> 03:03:29.889]  His name is not on the list that was prepared by the Federalist Society.
[03:03:30.421 --> 03:03:38.002]  Largely because he asked that it be taken off because of objections at Fox News under Roger Ailes at that time.
[03:03:38.963 --> 03:03:40.863]  But I really think he is a contender.
[03:03:41.303 --> 03:03:47.044]  The president gave him some indication of this back during the Forsage selection.
[03:03:47.604 --> 03:03:52.265]  I mean, I don't think the president could make a better choice than Andrew Napolitano.
[03:03:52.765 --> 03:03:58.006]  Solid conservative, but with a libertarian bent, a pro-freedom bent.
[03:03:58.717 --> 03:04:00.818]  Very much in the running, is what I hear.
[03:04:02.420 --> 03:04:06.722]  Well, to be specific, President Trump said, you're my next pick if everything works out, round two.
[03:04:06.762 --> 03:04:09.724]  So would you say, he's at the front of the pack, he's in the pole position?
[03:04:10.865 --> 03:04:11.125]  Sure.
[03:04:11.205 --> 03:04:20.392]  Now, we know there are certain establishmentarians who will seek to block him, and the treachery inside the Trump White House knows no bounds.
[03:04:20.932 --> 03:04:25.335]  That's what's so ironic, is that the President has gotten so much of his agenda done,
[03:04:25.998 --> 03:04:32.164]  Despite the fact that he has these whizzlings around him who are saying, oh no, you can't cashier the Iran deal, Mr. President.
[03:04:32.504 --> 03:04:35.026]  You've got to sign the Paris Accords, Mr. President.
[03:04:35.687 --> 03:04:37.969]  But Trump sticks to his guns.
[03:04:38.009 --> 03:04:39.871]  He's one of the most stubborn men I know.
[03:04:39.891 --> 03:04:41.972]  And I mean that in a positive sense.
[03:04:42.353 --> 03:04:44.375]  When he makes up his mind to do something,
[03:04:45.095 --> 03:04:47.478]  We'll do it, and he cannot talk about it.
[03:05:08.231 --> 03:05:11.353]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:05:11.373 --> 03:05:11.914]  You're on the air.
[03:05:11.934 --> 03:05:13.075]  Thanks for holding.
[03:05:13.095 --> 03:05:13.935]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:05:14.156 --> 03:05:14.756]  Hey, brother.
[03:05:15.076 --> 03:05:15.417]  Good, man.
[03:05:15.437 --> 03:05:16.257]  Thank you for calling.
[03:05:16.317 --> 03:05:16.898]  Hey, hey.
[03:05:16.998 --> 03:05:21.401]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:05:21.621 --> 03:05:27.986]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:05:28.126 --> 03:05:29.807]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[03:05:29.907 --> 03:05:35.632]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:05:37.213 --> 03:05:38.333]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:05:38.373 --> 03:05:40.834]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[03:05:40.874 --> 03:05:42.394]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:05:42.774 --> 03:05:44.375]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:05:44.835 --> 03:05:45.535]  And exactly.
[03:05:45.555 --> 03:05:49.876]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:05:50.196 --> 03:05:50.456]  Boom!
[03:05:50.616 --> 03:05:53.437]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:05:53.497 --> 03:05:54.037]  It's amazing.
[03:05:54.077 --> 03:05:55.377]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[03:05:55.437 --> 03:05:58.318]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:06:32.708 --> 03:06:38.153]  Alright, finishing up with Roger Stone, who in an hour will be hosting the War Room with Owen Schroyer just back from D.C.
[03:06:38.834 --> 03:06:40.496]  He was all over the hearings today.
[03:06:40.516 --> 03:06:41.797]  So many clubs that came and got into it.
[03:06:41.817 --> 03:06:47.282]  But hey, Jordan and Gowdy kept saying, well, did you ever
[03:06:51.464 --> 03:06:56.485]  We're at such an epic moment here in history.
[03:06:57.025 --> 03:07:01.047]  I always don't want to be too confident, Roger, but it does seem like the worm's turning.
[03:07:01.087 --> 03:07:04.848]  Not in some utopia, but at least we get some decent leadership that's trying to fix things.
[03:07:05.928 --> 03:07:10.429]  On your gut-level radar screen, what are you worried about?
[03:07:10.509 --> 03:07:11.409]  What are the curveballs?
[03:07:11.469 --> 03:07:13.090]  How do you think the deep state's going to strike back?
[03:07:14.474 --> 03:07:22.309]  I just can't see them, Alex, ever handing over this information on the illegal, unconstitutional surveillance of Americans.
[03:07:22.850 --> 03:07:25.372]  And the political use of the FISA warrants.
[03:07:25.392 --> 03:07:26.093]  Let me interrupt you.
[03:07:26.133 --> 03:07:33.539]  You said on January 20th, outside the inauguration, before, within and after, you said the illegal surveillance is the key to bring it all down.
[03:07:33.860 --> 03:07:35.421]  It's a hundred times bigger than Watergate.
[03:07:35.821 --> 03:07:36.962]  You said this is the key.
[03:07:37.023 --> 03:07:38.123]  Now that's all over the news.
[03:07:38.144 --> 03:07:39.064]  You were the trailblazer.
[03:07:39.124 --> 03:07:39.725]  It's just a fact.
[03:07:40.105 --> 03:07:41.126]  And so you're back to this.
[03:07:41.627 --> 03:07:43.408]  What is it Rosenstein will not turn over?
[03:07:43.428 --> 03:07:47.031]  Because he denied that he was even turning stuff over.
[03:07:47.051 --> 03:07:48.653]  I mean, he lied incredibly today.
[03:07:49.940 --> 03:07:51.541]  This guy is a weasel.
[03:07:51.761 --> 03:07:52.682]  You can see it.
[03:07:53.362 --> 03:07:59.967]  We have him, thanks to Reince Priebus, probably the President's single worst appointment, Mr. Rosenstein.
[03:08:00.387 --> 03:08:02.629]  He is the de facto Attorney General.
[03:08:03.169 --> 03:08:10.815]  But this surveillance is the cornerstone of this entire hijacking of an American election.
[03:08:11.655 --> 03:08:17.519]  If you pull out the cornerstone, or I should say the keystone, it will all collapse.
[03:08:17.639 --> 03:08:18.340]  It's a linchpin.
[03:08:19.178 --> 03:08:19.718]  And they know it.
[03:08:19.979 --> 03:08:20.419]  They know it.
[03:08:21.560 --> 03:08:29.747]  Because it completely exposes the effort by the Obama administration to wire the election for Hillary.
[03:08:30.427 --> 03:08:35.912]  This was the insurance policy that Stroke is talking about in his text messages.
[03:08:36.770 --> 03:08:42.691]  That's why I don't think Rosenstein will ever yield, which is why the president needs to fire him.
[03:08:43.111 --> 03:08:53.654]  What do you make of the amazing revelation that Jim Jordan's staff and others have been threatened directly by Rosenstein, and then he lies and says he never did it, and Jordan's like, I've known these people for years.
[03:08:53.754 --> 03:08:54.454]  You did this.
[03:08:55.454 --> 03:08:58.215]  And then he makes a joke about, we don't subpoena phone calls.
[03:08:58.295 --> 03:09:00.195]  No, just the records, you little weasel.
[03:09:01.655 --> 03:09:05.016]  I would say it's a very clear case of obstruction of justice.
[03:09:06.026 --> 03:09:10.969]  And he is trying to thwart the legitimate oversight authority of the U.S.
[03:09:11.029 --> 03:09:11.509]  Congress.
[03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:18.193]  It just demonstrates their total lack of any respect for the rule of law.
[03:09:18.893 --> 03:09:26.878]  When the FBI director gives his own speech, which we played on The War Room, talking about their respect for oversight, they don't respect oversight.
[03:09:27.198 --> 03:09:28.859]  They thwart oversight.
[03:09:28.879 --> 03:09:29.399]  Well, that's right.
[03:09:31.075 --> 03:09:37.476]  Fox News, AP, and others with copies of emails from Rosenstein saying, I'll subpoena you.
[03:09:39.037 --> 03:09:40.937]  And then he gets up and says, I didn't do that.
[03:09:41.337 --> 03:09:44.598]  But as a little lawyer provides, though, we don't subpoena phone calls.
[03:09:45.058 --> 03:09:53.599]  So, I mean, God, that is such an aggressive mooning of Congress, the American people, by Rosenstein.
[03:09:53.619 --> 03:09:56.680]  I mean, his bravado, his chutzpah is amazing.
[03:09:57.964 --> 03:10:05.212]  Well, and if you look at the size of the cufflinks that the guy is wearing at these hearings, he clearly has not read Stone's rules.
[03:10:06.514 --> 03:10:07.755]  How big should the cufflinks be?
[03:10:08.556 --> 03:10:08.957]  Small.
[03:10:09.517 --> 03:10:11.300]  Understated is the key.
[03:10:12.281 --> 03:10:16.786]  Look, this guy just oozes insincerity and
[03:10:17.298 --> 03:10:19.939]  We need a house plea at the Department of Justice.
[03:10:19.959 --> 03:10:21.080]  It's just no question.
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:26.463]  Why does he think laughing at Congress and getting all his minions to laugh at Jordan.
[03:10:26.483 --> 03:10:31.285]  I mean, does he have no instinct that like going and lying like he did?
[03:10:31.345 --> 03:10:35.107]  I think he didn't get that he was being destroyed in the late order today.
[03:10:35.147 --> 03:10:35.728]  I don't think he.
[03:10:36.008 --> 03:10:37.849]  Well, I don't get the arrogance of these guys.
[03:10:39.049 --> 03:10:43.992]  Well, except for he's in it now, there is no turning back because what he's covering up
[03:10:44.724 --> 03:10:49.688]  He's actually in this job at the recommendation of Congressman Elijah Cummings.
[03:10:49.708 --> 03:10:51.250]  That's beyond belief.
[03:11:04.266 --> 03:11:06.687]  Most historic wet shot in U.S., maybe world history.
[03:11:07.208 --> 03:11:09.689]  You know you're innocent, you know it's all, but they're not going to give up.
[03:11:09.729 --> 03:11:12.531]  So how do you, 60 seconds, we're going to the next co-host.
[03:11:13.011 --> 03:11:15.952]  How do you see this unraveling or where do you see this going?
[03:11:17.053 --> 03:11:18.314]  Well, it's very hard to know.
[03:11:18.414 --> 03:11:29.700]  On a personal basis, all I can do is try to build a war chest because I know I'm going to a thermonuclear legal war and they have the vast machinery and resources of the government.
[03:11:30.680 --> 03:11:33.322]  I sleep well at night because I know I've done nothing wrong.
[03:11:33.854 --> 03:11:39.578]  And I know that all of my political activities in 2016 to elect Donald Trump were perfectly legal.
[03:11:39.919 --> 03:11:41.120]  There is no Russian police.
[03:11:41.140 --> 03:11:42.040]  But I know what they were.
[03:11:42.100 --> 03:11:43.321]  It had nothing to do with Russia.
[03:11:43.341 --> 03:11:46.204]  It was reach black voters, reach women.
[03:11:46.304 --> 03:11:47.084]  I was involved.
[03:11:47.485 --> 03:11:49.326]  It had nothing to do with the Russians.
[03:11:50.507 --> 03:11:53.329]  So, but you know, why are they looking at my tax returns?
[03:11:53.409 --> 03:11:55.371]  Why are they looking at my financial records?
[03:11:55.751 --> 03:11:58.353]  Why are they asking questions about my family life?
[03:11:59.414 --> 03:12:01.555]  My relationship with my wife?
[03:12:01.675 --> 03:12:02.676]  My sex life?
[03:12:02.756 --> 03:12:03.577]  How much I drink?
[03:12:03.971 --> 03:12:05.251]  Brother, I smoke marijuana.
[03:12:05.651 --> 03:12:06.272]  Who cares?
[03:12:06.392 --> 03:12:08.072]  What does this have to do with the election?
[03:12:08.492 --> 03:12:12.313]  Let me ask this selfishly, because you said, like, a third of the questions were about me even a few weeks ago.
[03:12:12.353 --> 03:12:13.133]  Other people have told me that.
[03:12:13.453 --> 03:12:14.574]  Have they tapered off me?
[03:12:14.594 --> 03:12:17.274]  Because I heard there's, like, me in films and Joel Gilbert now.
[03:12:17.294 --> 03:12:18.335]  Like, are films are evil?
[03:12:19.735 --> 03:12:28.637]  Yeah, they're very focused on the documentary, Banished, the Danny Williams story, which first premiered here at InfoWars.
[03:12:29.117 --> 03:12:31.578]  Thirty-eight million Americans saw that.
[03:12:32.319 --> 03:12:37.145]  It was legally financed, it was legally promoted, and it was very successful.
[03:12:37.645 --> 03:12:40.408]  We're being penalized for effectiveness.
[03:12:41.069 --> 03:12:44.393]  We're being penalized because we supported Donald Trump.
[03:12:44.912 --> 03:12:45.972]  This is a witch hunt.
[03:12:46.132 --> 03:12:48.693]  It's a political persecution.
[03:12:48.713 --> 03:12:52.034]  It has nothing to do with breaking the law.
[03:12:52.374 --> 03:12:57.435]  It has everything to do with silencing me so that I can't come on in.
[03:12:57.615 --> 03:12:58.595]  Let's look at the president.
[03:12:58.695 --> 03:13:01.095]  He seems turbocharged, like he's winning.
[03:13:01.896 --> 03:13:03.216]  The energy level's way up.
[03:13:03.236 --> 03:13:04.216]  The peace deal's everything.
[03:13:04.956 --> 03:13:07.197]  Let's talk about Trump right now, just knowing him for 40 years.
[03:13:07.217 --> 03:13:11.378]  It seems like Trump's going into his next mode, attack mode.
[03:13:11.398 --> 03:13:12.638]  I think they should be worried.
[03:13:13.851 --> 03:13:20.419]  Well, his political capital has never been at this level because we have a booming economy and it's just going to get better.
[03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:24.424]  His corporate and personal tax cuts haven't even had a chance.
[03:13:24.444 --> 03:13:28.589]  And we've got pro-Supreme Court rulings, new Supreme Court nominations.
[03:13:28.649 --> 03:13:30.611]  I mean, he's like, wow, royal flush here.
[03:13:31.617 --> 03:13:35.961]  And he doesn't get credit for the conservative judges he's appointing at all levels.
[03:13:36.061 --> 03:13:39.964]  I mean, he is redoing the judiciary for a long period of time.
[03:13:39.984 --> 03:13:46.048]  So, in closing, how does Soros and Hillary, because that's who still runs the Democratic Party, how do they counter-strike?
[03:13:47.109 --> 03:13:51.452]  Look, the Mueller thing is not going to go away until the President fires Mueller.
[03:13:51.813 --> 03:13:52.974]  It's just a sad truth.
[03:13:53.314 --> 03:13:55.155]  Look at this piece in Bloomberg this week.
[03:13:55.616 --> 03:13:58.138]  Mueller to now focus on Russian collusion.
[03:13:58.978 --> 03:14:01.060]  I thought that's what he'd been doing for the last two years.
[03:14:01.769 --> 03:14:03.710]  And then they recycle the same old thing.
[03:14:04.411 --> 03:14:05.931]  Oh, the Donald Trump Jr.
[03:14:05.971 --> 03:14:06.272]  meeting.
[03:14:06.632 --> 03:14:17.058]  Well, they never mentioned that the Russian woman lawyer, who is clearly a plant, meets with the people at Fusion GPS before and after.
[03:14:17.078 --> 03:14:18.679]  Yeah, we all know it's a fraud, but let's go past that.
[03:14:19.960 --> 03:14:26.544]  Why would the Russians be able to engineer defeating the Democratic Party, rebooting America, having the best economy in 60 years, bringing everything back?
[03:14:26.664 --> 03:14:26.925]  Wow!
[03:14:27.325 --> 03:14:29.786]  If this is Russian management, thank you Vladimir Putin.
[03:14:29.826 --> 03:14:30.687]  But of course it's not.
[03:14:30.987 --> 03:14:32.308]  You and I both know it's us.
[03:14:32.628 --> 03:14:33.569]  It's the American people.
[03:14:33.729 --> 03:14:41.914]  It's all of us taking action and wanting to get away from... I mean, even Conrad Black of the Bilderberg Group came out and said, this isn't any Russians.
[03:14:42.415 --> 03:14:46.177]  We've had globalist programs to keep America poor, to siphon off its wealth for decades.
[03:14:46.497 --> 03:14:48.779]  We were a pressure cooker about to explode.
[03:14:49.099 --> 03:14:52.460]  Trump realized that with others, and they're just saying, why not have prosperity?
[03:14:52.760 --> 03:14:58.342]  I mean, I just can't believe the weird hard-on that Obama and the globalists had, like, screw America.
[03:14:58.522 --> 03:14:59.703]  Let me ask you that in 60 seconds.
[03:15:00.463 --> 03:15:02.944]  Why do the globalists hate America so much?
[03:15:03.044 --> 03:15:04.064]  What is their mental illness?
[03:15:05.205 --> 03:15:07.066]  Because they're for one world government.
[03:15:07.106 --> 03:15:08.906]  They're against American sovereignty.
[03:15:09.726 --> 03:15:13.648]  Look, the one thing about Trump that people need to understand is he believes in success.
[03:15:14.366 --> 03:15:15.547]  He believes in winning.
[03:15:15.667 --> 03:15:19.728]  He wants to see this country richer and more prosperous than ever before.
[03:15:20.109 --> 03:15:22.029]  But he wants it to be at the family level.
[03:15:22.209 --> 03:15:26.871]  He wants your family to be rich and to have opportunity and prospects.
[03:15:27.412 --> 03:15:32.434]  And he also knows that this is the keystone to his long-term political success.
[03:15:33.001 --> 03:15:35.923]  That's why he's got a nice bounce in his step these days.
[03:15:36.183 --> 03:15:36.623]  That's right.
[03:15:36.744 --> 03:15:37.704]  He is all in.
[03:15:37.804 --> 03:15:39.906]  His success is bound to American success.
[03:15:39.926 --> 03:15:41.026]  We finally have it.
[03:15:41.587 --> 03:15:47.471]  And someone who's not a coward, who's committed, who is blooming under our spiritual support.
[03:15:47.871 --> 03:15:49.712]  Roger Stone, amazing job.
[03:15:50.193 --> 03:15:51.434]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:15:51.494 --> 03:15:52.334]  Donate there, folks.
[03:15:52.394 --> 03:15:53.635]  Donate at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:15:54.035 --> 03:15:54.956]  We need your support.
[03:15:54.996 --> 03:15:56.997]  This is a great opportunity to be involved in this.
[03:15:57.017 --> 03:15:57.838]  Lionel's coming up.
[03:15:57.858 --> 03:15:58.378]  Stay with us.
[03:15:58.398 --> 03:15:59.059]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:15:59.079 --> 03:16:02.041]  I'll be back at the War Room later today.
[03:16:03.755 --> 03:16:19.035]  Tomorrow's news today, we broke down even before the London Guardian did with Leo Zagami about four or five years ago, that you would have this new Pope, the head of the Jesuits, and that now Pope Francis, as he's known, would try to finally destroy any...
[03:16:19.315 --> 03:16:22.478]  Christianity, any conservatism in the Catholic Church.
[03:16:22.558 --> 03:16:28.122]  And he's now declared war on borders, declared war saying he's disgusted by people talking about Europe's Christian roots.
[03:16:28.302 --> 03:16:33.226]  He's calling for major governments to be disarmed, but of course the UN will be armed right out of Hunger Games.
[03:16:33.426 --> 03:16:43.634]  And his right-hand man, the number three person at the Vatican, Cardinal George Pell, to face trial on historic abuse charges reportedly trafficking in hundreds of young boys for decades.
[03:16:43.894 --> 03:16:44.814]  Who is this Pope?
[03:16:44.834 --> 03:16:48.376]  Why does he live behind 180-foot walls that says Europe shouldn't have any?
[03:16:48.416 --> 03:16:50.777]  Why does he say he doesn't like Europe's Christian roots?
[03:16:50.837 --> 03:16:52.577]  Why is he allied with radical Islam?
[03:16:52.777 --> 03:16:56.799]  Why is he saying the whole world should turn their weapons in, but of course the UN and the globalists?
[03:16:56.839 --> 03:17:11.645]  When we talk about Pope Francis preaching now via Twitter that everybody should disarm itself and get rid of weapons, we have to understand that Pope Francis has the best bodyguards on the planet!
[03:17:12.885 --> 03:17:17.267]  He's trained since basically 600 years ago.
[03:17:17.287 --> 03:17:19.769]  There are 125 Swiss Guards.
[03:17:19.909 --> 03:17:21.990]  They use the most lethal weapons.
[03:17:22.350 --> 03:17:29.273]  So to actually state that he wants to get rid of his weapons is the biggest joke ever.
[03:17:29.293 --> 03:17:30.214]  Really, Alex.
[03:17:30.454 --> 03:17:31.074]  It's hilarious.
[03:17:31.634 --> 03:18:01.114]  And regarding Cardinal Pell, Cardinal Pell now is facing also, of course, a lot of criticism within the Vatican conservative side that tomorrow has a very important event, and that is the election of the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta that will take place on the 2nd, tomorrow, the 2nd of May 2018, in a period of uncertainty for the Knights of Malta that are seen by Pope Francis as a threat.
[03:18:01.454 --> 03:18:15.206]  Because within the Knights of Malta there are certain conservative forces that have been laying down for centuries there and don't want to give up on real capitalism, which of course Pope Francis is completely destroying.
[03:18:15.366 --> 03:18:21.852]  This is a big thing, Alex, especially now because the Pope wants to destroy the Knights of Malta,
[03:18:22.512 --> 03:18:23.192]  We're good to go.
[03:18:51.528 --> 03:19:00.964]  But of course, if the conservative forces lose tomorrow, the Knights of Malta will be taken over by the Jesuits and they will be destroyed.
[03:19:03.462 --> 03:19:08.024]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:19:08.044 --> 03:19:08.544]  Thanks for calling.
[03:19:08.604 --> 03:19:09.524]  Hey Alex, mate.
[03:19:09.664 --> 03:19:13.566]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:19:13.646 --> 03:19:22.389]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[03:19:22.529 --> 03:19:38.671]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[03:19:39.191 --> 03:19:47.699]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:19:47.779 --> 03:19:52.543]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:19:52.684 --> 03:19:58.289]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[03:20:06.079 --> 03:20:10.584]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.908 --> 03:20:24.979]  Well, we've got breaking news from Fox News and Town Hall.
[03:20:25.059 --> 03:20:25.839]  Mass shooting.
[03:20:27.340 --> 03:20:38.982]  In a newsroom, in Maryland newsroom, Fox News is reporting that there are multiple fatalities and arrests that might have been made at the Sheriff of Anna County spoke to Shep Smith.
[03:20:39.462 --> 03:20:43.143]  We'll keep you updated and go ahead and scroll down on that because I've got my article cut off here.
[03:20:43.183 --> 03:20:43.703]  I can't read it.
[03:20:43.723 --> 03:20:45.284]  Go ahead and scroll down please.
[03:20:46.004 --> 03:20:50.525]  So we've got that going on right now.
[03:20:51.145 --> 03:20:52.485]  Lionel is about to be taking over.
[03:20:57.199 --> 03:21:02.506]  So we have reports of a shooting in Maryland at a newspaper newsroom.
[03:21:05.730 --> 03:21:07.813]  And we'll have more of that as it unfolds.
[03:21:07.853 --> 03:21:10.677]  Here's a clip from Fox News breaking it down.
[03:21:10.697 --> 03:21:12.299]  It's at the Capital Gazette newspaper.
[03:21:12.359 --> 03:21:12.639]  Here it is.
[03:21:13.422 --> 03:21:16.463]  You get a better idea of kind of what the response is for this.
[03:21:16.843 --> 03:21:26.426]  And we've seen a lot of these, Shep, whether it's a hospital or a newspaper or a school, you can get an idea of what's happening inside the building by what's happening outside.
[03:21:26.746 --> 03:21:28.326]  Are they in barricaded positions?
[03:21:28.346 --> 03:21:32.868]  You can see at the top right hand of your screen, there seems to be some officers kind of gathered there.
[03:21:32.928 --> 03:21:41.370]  Well, you saw there, you don't have, we don't have control of the helicopter pictures, but there seem to be some officers or first responders, medical personnel,
[03:21:41.770 --> 03:21:42.551]  We're good to go.
[03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:15.073]  Folks, it's the Capital Gazette newspaper.
[03:22:16.134 --> 03:22:18.257]  Reportedly multiple people shot.
[03:22:18.677 --> 03:22:19.257]  We'll watch that.
[03:22:19.277 --> 03:22:21.680]  But notice when there's hundreds of car deaths a day, no news.
[03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:23.061]  Hundreds of stabbings, no news.
[03:22:23.081 --> 03:22:24.142]  They're just hype shootings.
[03:22:24.162 --> 03:22:25.403]  We hope it isn't a giant shooting.
[03:22:25.724 --> 03:22:26.905]  We're sad for whoever's been shot.
[03:22:27.686 --> 03:22:32.911]  But those are the type of things that happen in any society where you've got 330 million people.
[03:22:33.331 --> 03:22:34.092]  Active shooter at 888.
[03:22:36.026 --> 03:22:38.267]  Bestgate, please help us.
[03:22:38.747 --> 03:22:40.228]  That's the type of news coming out.
[03:22:40.268 --> 03:22:43.249]  It's a bunch of incoherent gibbering at this point.
[03:22:44.109 --> 03:22:45.449]  So we'll continue to follow all that.
[03:22:46.029 --> 03:22:47.950]  But quite a historic point we're at right now.
[03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:49.971]  Lionel of Lionel Media joins us.
[03:22:49.991 --> 03:22:51.231]  He's taking over the broadcast.
[03:22:51.711 --> 03:22:53.672]  A great syndicated talk show host in his own right.
[03:22:54.052 --> 03:22:58.594]  We'll obviously probably cover this as we learn more about it, but what do you make of the Supreme Court situation?
[03:22:58.654 --> 03:22:59.334]  What do you make of
[03:23:00.094 --> 03:23:07.381]  What happened in Congress today with those incredible hearings and Rosenstein saying that he knows nothing and I think perjuring himself from what we already know on the record.
[03:23:07.742 --> 03:23:09.023]  This is just an amazing time.
[03:23:09.063 --> 03:23:11.606]  What would you, Lionel, call this time we're live in right now?
[03:23:12.355 --> 03:23:14.496]  Well, very fascinating times.
[03:23:14.696 --> 03:23:21.717]  First, in terms of the actual makeup, this will absolutely guarantee, the first rule is, a conservative majority.
[03:23:22.158 --> 03:23:24.178]  Next rule is, how does it make any difference?
[03:23:24.638 --> 03:23:31.140]  Look, Alex, one of the things that people forget is that these judges, these federal judges, may have very, very serious
[03:23:32.250 --> 03:23:32.951]  We're good to go.
[03:23:56.113 --> 03:23:58.775]  This is hardcore boring.
[03:23:58.995 --> 03:24:10.064]  I mean, minutiae fisheries act and going back and whether the doctrine of preemptive doctrine applies to such as I mean, it's not what people think.
[03:24:10.625 --> 03:24:12.426]  But here's the interesting part about this.
[03:24:13.147 --> 03:24:19.992]  You know, Alex, when something when when these judges and justices put that robe on, something happens.
[03:24:20.492 --> 03:24:23.575]  And historically, we have learned when Byron Whizzer White,
[03:24:24.384 --> 03:24:28.206]  Under John Kennedy, he thought, he's obviously one of us.
[03:24:28.266 --> 03:24:29.627]  A liberal, progressive.
[03:24:29.907 --> 03:24:33.930]  As soon as he put this on, and he basically said, so they can't fire me?
[03:24:34.270 --> 03:24:36.712]  He became one of the most conservative justices ever.
[03:24:37.112 --> 03:24:38.393]  Then Harry Blackmun.
[03:24:38.713 --> 03:24:40.534]  Harry Blackmun was appointed by Nixon.
[03:24:40.814 --> 03:24:43.055]  He penned Roe against Wade.
[03:24:43.496 --> 03:24:47.118]  And the granddaddy of them all, that everybody knows about, is Earl Warren.
[03:24:47.842 --> 03:24:53.268]  And in fact, Eisenhower called it the worst g-damn mistake I've ever made in my life.
[03:24:53.549 --> 03:24:55.551]  So, once this happens...
[03:24:56.677 --> 03:24:57.938]  Their personalities change.
[03:24:58.139 --> 03:25:01.021]  Also, Scalia is not what you think.
[03:25:01.541 --> 03:25:06.725]  He did so many cases and so many opinions that nobody ever read.
[03:25:07.086 --> 03:25:09.268]  Nobody went back and poured through them.
[03:25:09.688 --> 03:25:17.834]  Whenever they do this, whenever they deny search, when they basically say, let the lower court handle it, it's basically saying we're not going to do anything.
[03:25:17.874 --> 03:25:21.698]  So all I want people to do is don't lose your mind.
[03:25:21.918 --> 03:25:25.861]  But the good news is, Alex, I'd love to see how the left
[03:25:26.562 --> 03:25:34.827]  This, this, this intellectually febrile group of people are losing their minds and they don't know why.
[03:25:34.847 --> 03:25:42.591]  They're like this attack dog that just keeps barking and yipping and yelping and they don't know why.
[03:25:42.611 --> 03:25:45.153]  And with Ruth Bader Ginsburg next.
[03:25:46.528 --> 03:25:49.869]  I mean, we're going to be talking about now a 6-3 court?
[03:25:50.550 --> 03:25:52.910]  I mean, will Joyce Bader?
[03:25:52.930 --> 03:25:59.913]  That's what America needs to counter the bizarre communist Chinese-funded attack on America.
[03:25:59.933 --> 03:26:04.255]  I think even American elites realize the country's going to go down if we don't stabilize it.
[03:26:04.295 --> 03:26:07.696]  And the left has become this poisonous, crazy thing.
[03:26:07.716 --> 03:26:10.337]  And I think there's a real countervailing wind against that.
[03:26:11.317 --> 03:26:11.858]  Absolutely.
[03:26:11.878 --> 03:26:12.798]  And I also think something, too.
[03:26:12.958 --> 03:26:14.479]  Let's talk about abortion for just a moment.
[03:26:16.005 --> 03:26:17.186]  Abortion is not going to change.
[03:26:17.926 --> 03:26:19.347]  It is just not going to change.
[03:26:19.367 --> 03:26:20.588]  You're not going to see it go away.
[03:26:20.908 --> 03:26:25.791]  You're not going to see Roe against Wade appealed, or excuse me, reversed, or removed.
[03:26:25.811 --> 03:26:27.492]  No, it's just going to go back to the states.
[03:26:28.473 --> 03:26:33.876]  Well, what's going to happen is you're going to see stare decisis, which is a wonderful doctrine, but one of the things that people forget
[03:26:34.588 --> 03:26:39.209]  Is that you've got a very, very deep state on the deep bench.
[03:26:39.749 --> 03:26:41.030]  And there are too many people.
[03:26:41.170 --> 03:26:54.594]  I'm sorry to say this may be a bit a bit dark, but there are too many people who are Malthusian, too many depopulators who aren't going to allow this form of eugenics and frankly genocide to go by the wayside.
[03:26:54.834 --> 03:26:56.014]  This is too critical.
[03:26:56.574 --> 03:26:57.915]  Nobody's going to get in the way of this.
[03:26:57.955 --> 03:27:01.698]  And they're going to talk about, you know, giving in to the will of the people.
[03:27:02.039 --> 03:27:10.205]  But nobody wants, and I hate to say it, but this critical means of liquidating, basically, humanity.
[03:27:10.466 --> 03:27:12.867]  If you think that's going to happen, it ain't going to happen at all.
[03:27:13.208 --> 03:27:18.352]  But you're also going to see, basically, tests on it, and you're going to see it chipped away, perhaps.
[03:27:18.632 --> 03:27:20.013]  But that is there.
[03:27:20.394 --> 03:27:23.176]  What's going to be interesting, Alex, and this is the most important.
[03:27:23.736 --> 03:27:35.400]  Is we need a judge, a justice, excuse me, who is able to understand what the rigors of today's technology are going to mean in terms of artificial intelligence.
[03:27:35.780 --> 03:27:38.421]  The fact that we are absenting ourselves... That's right.
[03:27:38.441 --> 03:27:41.962]  While they're busy worried about humans, we have all the technology and these bigger challenges.
[03:27:42.342 --> 03:27:43.663]  Are they too old to understand that?
[03:27:43.683 --> 03:27:44.363]  You're absolutely right.
[03:27:45.423 --> 03:28:04.350]  That's really the critical issue here, is the globalists don't even care what judges and people do now, because they believe they've already leapfrogged so past far that, that the real folks, even if they're pro-human, need to understand they need to project what they're doing in their rulings onto that situation, which needs to be always pro-human, always about review, and against big mega-corporations and monopolies.
[03:28:04.590 --> 03:28:09.592]  And the biggest thing the Supreme Court can do is bust up these big monopolies and break these things up.
[03:28:09.612 --> 03:28:11.813]  Because if they don't do that, everything else goes out the window.
[03:28:12.881 --> 03:28:17.944]  You've also got transhumanism is going to take on an incredibly important aspect of this.
[03:28:18.224 --> 03:28:18.764]  Think about this.
[03:28:18.984 --> 03:28:24.127]  You know, Alex, one of the worst things that ever happened, well, in the development of war, was the longbow.
[03:28:24.788 --> 03:28:33.032]  Once people became, or enjoyed the ability to shoot and to kill from far away, it dehumanized warfare.
[03:28:33.493 --> 03:28:35.234]  When you put... You're right.
[03:28:35.254 --> 03:28:39.296]  So the Welsh longbow, and then now we have the predator drone, and then next we have the bioweapon.
[03:28:40.293 --> 03:28:47.502]  Precisely, and when you absent yourself from human interaction, from the notion of conscience, it is devastating.
[03:28:48.083 --> 03:28:54.872]  That's where victory comes from, the original, the two fingers, like, cause the Normans would cut those off, like, no, I have these, you're gonna die.
[03:28:54.892 --> 03:28:56.714]  Plucking, plucking the U.
[03:28:58.473 --> 03:29:01.316]  Remember, with the finger plucking the U, you can pull back.
[03:29:01.816 --> 03:29:05.400]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[03:29:05.800 --> 03:29:08.222]  But sometimes, supplements don't work fast enough.
[03:29:08.542 --> 03:29:12.907]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.

[03:30:02.611 --> 03:30:07.153]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:30:07.173 --> 03:30:07.674]  Thanks for holding.
[03:30:07.734 --> 03:30:08.674]  Hey Alex, mate.
[03:30:08.814 --> 03:30:12.716]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:30:12.796 --> 03:30:21.541]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[03:30:21.661 --> 03:30:37.798]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[03:30:38.318 --> 03:30:46.847]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:30:46.907 --> 03:30:51.692]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:30:51.812 --> 03:30:56.737]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there.

[03:32:20.075 --> 03:32:26.419]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[03:32:27.220 --> 03:32:32.463]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:32:33.084 --> 03:32:41.810]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including...
[03:32:49.995 --> 03:32:52.196]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:19.289 --> 03:33:20.750]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.050 --> 03:33:27.514]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.356 --> 03:33:32.356]  Howdy, Elaina with you.
[03:33:32.556 --> 03:33:34.597]  I'm sitting here for the last half hour.
[03:33:34.677 --> 03:33:39.600]  There is this shooting, nobody knows what's going on, and you would think people would perhaps leave it at that.
[03:33:39.940 --> 03:33:43.963]  And I also have to say that, you know, Fox News does a hell of a job.
[03:33:44.163 --> 03:33:46.284]  Shep Smith, when it comes to
[03:33:47.199 --> 03:33:52.881]  He's doing more and more, sadly, more and more shootouts than he used to do, but he's very, very good.
[03:33:52.901 --> 03:33:54.522]  I mean, after all, he's no Don Lemon.
[03:33:55.022 --> 03:33:56.862]  In fact, Don Lemon is not a Don Lemon.
[03:33:57.403 --> 03:33:58.803]  Let me go back to what's going on, my dear friends.
[03:33:58.843 --> 03:34:03.305]  If you don't mind me explaining to you this notion about the Supreme Court, a couple of things I want to invite you to do.
[03:34:03.465 --> 03:34:06.626]  Number one, please read the decision.
[03:34:07.617 --> 03:34:08.597]  Read the Hawaii case.
[03:34:08.837 --> 03:34:09.538]  Fine, how are you?
[03:34:09.698 --> 03:34:10.558]  I'm sorry.
[03:34:10.858 --> 03:34:11.478]  Read the case.
[03:34:11.819 --> 03:34:15.180]  Read Judge Roberts and how he basically distilled it.
[03:34:15.200 --> 03:34:16.420]  It's very, very simple.
[03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:22.523]  There's a beauty in the way courts can review cases.
[03:34:22.563 --> 03:34:28.765]  There's a beauty the way it goes through the logical aspect of it, to look at the statute.
[03:34:28.845 --> 03:34:31.606]  I don't want to bore you with this, but it's not about
[03:34:32.146 --> 03:34:35.009]  I'm a conservative, or I'm a Democrat, or I'm a Republican.
[03:34:35.089 --> 03:34:35.469]  No!
[03:34:35.570 --> 03:34:37.211]  It's very, very linear.
[03:34:37.692 --> 03:34:41.135]  It's beautiful, critical thinking, critical analysis.
[03:34:41.475 --> 03:34:43.537]  That's the kind of judge you need.
[03:34:43.957 --> 03:34:47.621]  You need a judge who is going to apply the law.
[03:34:47.641 --> 03:34:48.642]  Let me give you an example.
[03:34:49.383 --> 03:34:54.467]  There are some things that I personally, personally do not care for.
[03:34:54.828 --> 03:34:55.849]  One is the death penalty.
[03:34:56.360 --> 03:34:58.941]  Never liked it, especially after being a prosecutor.
[03:34:59.241 --> 03:35:03.964]  The last thing in the world I'm going to see is anybody have the right to kill anybody when they're putting the wrong people in jail.
[03:35:04.104 --> 03:35:23.093]  OK, if I were a judge, if I were a judge and I were able to get a case and I had to look at the propriety of whether the death penalty was correctly applied, whether it was carried out, whether it was, of course, the will of the people, I would absolutely
[03:35:24.079 --> 03:35:29.683]  Go ahead and say, as a judge, this is from 2011, I would go ahead and say, nothing wrong with this case.
[03:35:30.103 --> 03:35:31.064]  I don't like it.
[03:35:31.645 --> 03:35:32.745]  I don't care for it.
[03:35:33.446 --> 03:35:44.194]  If I had to deal with the notion of abortion, and it's always framed in a particular way, judges don't get broad issues of, is it a human life?
[03:35:44.214 --> 03:35:47.436]  I mean, very rarely is that the consideration.
[03:35:47.456 --> 03:35:50.278]  It might be something very, very fine-tuned.
[03:35:51.319 --> 03:35:52.960]  I have an ambivalence to that.
[03:35:53.880 --> 03:35:58.642]  I do not want to see a woman put thrown into prison or jail because she has an abortion!
[03:35:59.243 --> 03:36:00.643]  But I don't want her to have an abortion!
[03:36:01.203 --> 03:36:02.884]  It doesn't make any sense, and I realize that.
[03:36:02.904 --> 03:36:03.604]  I recognize that.
[03:36:04.185 --> 03:36:08.647]  There are some times when we have these weird kind of moral ambivalences that don't make any sense.
[03:36:09.387 --> 03:36:10.528]  You know, life is precious.
[03:36:11.767 --> 03:36:15.970]  Well, but we're for the death penalty, but against abortion, I don't know.
[03:36:16.230 --> 03:36:18.492]  None of it makes any sense, and I'm not going to argue the point here.
[03:36:18.852 --> 03:36:26.538]  The thing is that a judge, you want to judge justice, I should say, to be able to look at this and within the framework of that which is provided.
[03:36:27.318 --> 03:36:28.099]  Answer the question.
[03:36:28.299 --> 03:36:31.261]  You know, we all love Antonin Scalia, OK?
[03:36:32.202 --> 03:36:39.046]  The guy who, by the way, died in some Illuminati, you know, hunting lodge with a pillow on his head.
[03:36:39.066 --> 03:36:41.328]  I've never understood that one.
[03:36:41.957 --> 03:36:42.358]  Never!
[03:36:42.498 --> 03:36:44.179]  You don't need Columbo to figure this one.
[03:36:44.379 --> 03:36:46.301]  The world's fastest autopsy.
[03:36:46.522 --> 03:36:47.502]  Over the phone!
[03:36:48.704 --> 03:36:54.009]  Remember when Anthony Bourdain, when they clipped him, or when he died, or whatever it was?
[03:36:54.589 --> 03:36:55.831]  Quickest thing you ever saw.
[03:36:55.851 --> 03:36:57.312]  Remember on CNN?
[03:36:57.352 --> 03:36:58.273]  Well, it's a suicide.
[03:36:58.353 --> 03:36:58.914]  Okay, next.
[03:36:58.954 --> 03:36:59.314]  Moving on.
[03:36:59.374 --> 03:37:00.175]  Wait a minute!
[03:37:00.755 --> 03:37:01.416]  What happened?
[03:37:01.476 --> 03:37:01.996]  I don't know.
[03:37:02.237 --> 03:37:02.697]  It was fine.
[03:37:02.997 --> 03:37:04.519]  Nothing to see here, but that's another issue.
[03:37:05.293 --> 03:37:15.033]  But Scalia had this thing where he said, I'm an originalist, and I want to look at the Constitution within the framework of what the original drafters of the Constitution believe.
[03:37:15.133 --> 03:37:16.296]  Oh, come on!
[03:37:17.199 --> 03:37:18.020]  Are you kidding me?
[03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:18.880]  You can't do that!
[03:37:19.101 --> 03:37:20.802]  The Constitution, have you read it?
[03:37:21.082 --> 03:37:21.763]  The Bill of Rights?
[03:37:22.063 --> 03:37:23.104]  It's horrible!
[03:37:23.584 --> 03:37:24.845]  There's nothing there!
[03:37:25.225 --> 03:37:27.267]  It doesn't tell you even how many justices you should have.
[03:37:27.287 --> 03:37:28.548]  It doesn't mention the Air Force.
[03:37:28.568 --> 03:37:29.849]  It doesn't mention marriage.
[03:37:29.869 --> 03:37:31.090]  It doesn't mention voting.
[03:37:31.110 --> 03:37:33.071]  It doesn't mention anything!
[03:37:33.692 --> 03:37:34.092]  It's breath!
[03:37:35.874 --> 03:37:40.177]  It's bereft, it's wanting of information, of data.
[03:37:40.437 --> 03:37:45.321]  It is the worst prose, even the whole notion, in order to form a more perfect union.
[03:37:45.801 --> 03:37:46.702]  A more perfect?
[03:37:46.802 --> 03:37:47.702]  What does that mean?
[03:37:47.722 --> 03:37:50.444]  If you can understand the Second Amendment, good for you.
[03:37:51.085 --> 03:37:57.329]  The point of this is that as the courts have looked at this, they've read into it.
[03:37:57.849 --> 03:37:59.030]  We all know, for example,
[03:38:00.265 --> 03:38:03.926]  I don't want to bore you with this, but if we're going to be talking about the Supreme Court, you've got to know some rudimentary facts.
[03:38:04.466 --> 03:38:06.727]  We all know this thing called the exclusionary rule, right?
[03:38:07.047 --> 03:38:14.849]  This is where the police, if they break down your door, if they take something, if they don't have a warrant, if they violate the Fourth Amendment, that evidence is excluded.
[03:38:14.989 --> 03:38:16.009]  It's suppressed.
[03:38:16.529 --> 03:38:18.550]  They make a motion to suppress at the trial level.
[03:38:18.570 --> 03:38:19.610]  You all know that, right?
[03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:20.450]  Makes sense.
[03:38:20.930 --> 03:38:22.651]  That's not in the Constitution.
[03:38:23.011 --> 03:38:24.291]  That's not in the Bill of Rights.
[03:38:24.790 --> 03:38:25.631]  To nowhere at all!
[03:38:25.891 --> 03:38:26.672]  Nowhere!
[03:38:26.692 --> 03:38:28.733]  It was a case called Map Against Ohio.
[03:38:28.753 --> 03:38:30.155]  19 was it?
[03:38:30.175 --> 03:38:30.155]  61!
[03:38:30.755 --> 03:38:35.940]  And the Supreme Court created the doctrine of the exclusionary rule.
[03:38:36.200 --> 03:38:40.984]  There were justices and judges back then who said, this is ridiculous!
[03:38:41.765 --> 03:38:45.288]  You're going to throw a case up because of a constable's error?
[03:38:45.848 --> 03:38:46.349]  Sue!
[03:38:47.129 --> 03:38:47.650]  Sue them!
[03:38:48.479 --> 03:38:49.580]  Sue the police officer!
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:51.660]  Sue the police officer!
[03:38:52.001 --> 03:38:53.001]  What are you talking about?
[03:38:53.081 --> 03:38:54.982]  I'm on trial for my life!
[03:38:55.442 --> 03:39:01.845]  You seized evidence that, incorrectly, and I'm going to face the death penalty and you want me to file a civil lawsuit?
[03:39:02.105 --> 03:39:03.646]  What are you talking about?
[03:39:04.506 --> 03:39:05.747]  Read the First Amendment.
[03:39:05.907 --> 03:39:07.127]  What is covered?
[03:39:07.267 --> 03:39:08.408]  Fighting words no good.
[03:39:08.928 --> 03:39:12.129]  Libel isn't covered by the First Amendment.
[03:39:12.450 --> 03:39:13.090]  What is?
[03:39:13.829 --> 03:39:16.752]  The Fourth Amendment says you have to have a warrant to arrest.
[03:39:16.832 --> 03:39:18.754]  Nobody has a warrant to arrest.
[03:39:18.834 --> 03:39:21.457]  And half of the time we're searching, there's an exception to it.
[03:39:21.938 --> 03:39:22.118]  Look.
[03:39:23.203 --> 03:39:25.345]  It's a beautiful dance.
[03:39:25.905 --> 03:39:31.650]  And the first part of the dance, the first part of the minuet, is to pretend that we're doing something.
[03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:33.752]  That we're following some rule.
[03:39:34.112 --> 03:39:35.073]  Not really.
[03:39:35.633 --> 03:39:36.694]  Here's one for you.
[03:39:36.954 --> 03:39:38.075]  Let me ask you this question.
[03:39:38.455 --> 03:39:40.377]  You know how the Fifth Amendment works, right?
[03:39:40.817 --> 03:39:44.180]  You can't be compelled to give testimony against yourself.
[03:39:44.660 --> 03:39:45.541]  Doesn't that make sense?
[03:39:45.981 --> 03:39:49.044]  They can't throw you on the stand and say, you, take this stand.
[03:39:49.504 --> 03:39:50.265]  Where were you on November 22nd, 1963?
[03:39:52.881 --> 03:39:54.722]  I wasn't even born.
[03:39:54.742 --> 03:39:56.102]  I'm not going to testify.
[03:39:56.262 --> 03:39:56.782]  Oh yeah?
[03:39:57.082 --> 03:39:58.762]  Well if you don't, we're going to throw you in jail.
[03:39:59.042 --> 03:40:04.003]  You have no duty to compel or be compelled to testify against yourself.
[03:40:04.664 --> 03:40:05.104]  All the time.
[03:40:05.184 --> 03:40:06.044]  It makes complete sense.
[03:40:06.324 --> 03:40:08.964]  You as a defendant, you don't have to take the stand.
[03:40:09.545 --> 03:40:18.406]  In fact, if the prosecutor even hints, even insinuates, years ago as a prosecutor we said, well, I didn't do this, but I heard about this.
[03:40:20.047 --> 03:40:21.167]  Sometimes more
[03:40:21.883 --> 03:40:30.869]  Well, older, unscrupulous prosecutors would say, well, in the case where the defendant wouldn't take the stand, they would say, well, you know, they say there's two sides to every story.
[03:40:31.450 --> 03:40:33.251]  Well, you never guess with this guy.
[03:40:34.172 --> 03:40:36.233]  Meaning, well, why didn't he testify?
[03:40:36.974 --> 03:40:39.255]  You can't even, that's a mistrial.
[03:40:39.435 --> 03:40:40.076]  It's gone.
[03:40:40.136 --> 03:40:40.556]  It's through.
[03:40:40.696 --> 03:40:40.936]  Okay.
[03:40:41.777 --> 03:40:42.517]  So you understand?
[03:40:42.778 --> 03:40:43.578]  Makes sense, right?
[03:40:44.279 --> 03:40:47.121]  You can't be forced to get evidence against yourself.
[03:40:47.661 --> 03:40:48.862]  What do you call a breathalyzer?
[03:40:49.673 --> 03:40:54.780]  What do you call when you're driving and they suspect you of drunk driving, and there's been an accident, great bodily harm, disfigurement, death, whatever?
[03:40:55.021 --> 03:40:58.686]  They can hold you down and suck the blood out of your veins!
[03:40:59.227 --> 03:41:01.410]  That's not giving compelled testimony!
[03:41:02.105 --> 03:41:11.389]  You mean to tell me the case is based on a blood alcohol reading, and you're holding me down, and you're taking it from me?
[03:41:12.030 --> 03:41:13.870]  I'm not giving evidence against myself?
[03:41:14.311 --> 03:41:16.712]  You know what the Supreme Court said in a case called Schmerber?
[03:41:16.772 --> 03:41:19.693]  I think it was Armando Schmerber, 1970, whatever.
[03:41:19.873 --> 03:41:22.174]  They said, that's not testimonial.
[03:41:22.775 --> 03:41:22.995]  What?
[03:41:23.495 --> 03:41:25.696]  No, that's not testimonial.
[03:41:26.340 --> 03:41:29.505]  Field sobriety test, breathalyzer, things like that.
[03:41:29.605 --> 03:41:31.929]  That's not testimonial.
[03:41:32.690 --> 03:41:36.035]  They make stuff up all the time.
[03:41:36.416 --> 03:41:38.098]  They make exceptions.
[03:41:38.159 --> 03:41:40.142]  They, they, the Supreme Court.
[03:41:40.322 --> 03:41:41.404]  So this business
[03:41:42.139 --> 03:41:45.481]  That Scalia gives you about, well, we don't legislate from the bench.
[03:41:45.741 --> 03:41:47.202]  Are you kidding me?
[03:41:47.782 --> 03:41:48.683]  All the time!
[03:41:49.063 --> 03:41:51.445]  How about fruit of the poisonous tree?
[03:41:51.845 --> 03:41:53.446]  That's what people are suggesting right now.
[03:41:53.846 --> 03:42:09.815]  They say that the Mueller investigation is so horrible that if I break into a home, let's say I'm an unscrupulous cop, and I take something, and I seize, I grab it without a warrant, and from that piece, that thing that I've seized, let's say it's a key,
[03:42:11.388 --> 03:42:14.690]  To the proverbial locker at the bus station.
[03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:19.952]  In the bus station locker, there's cocaine that I got from this key.
[03:42:20.353 --> 03:42:22.174]  The fruit of the poisonous tree.
[03:42:22.394 --> 03:42:23.454]  A derivative fine.
[03:42:23.874 --> 03:42:25.215]  Even that's suppressed.
[03:42:26.036 --> 03:42:29.978]  Look, all you want in the Constitution for that baby, it ain't there.
[03:42:30.298 --> 03:42:32.579]  Some activist court came up with that.
[03:42:33.248 --> 03:42:36.290]  So I want a judge who knows when to be active.
[03:42:36.850 --> 03:42:38.091]  Knows when to realize it.
[03:42:38.131 --> 03:42:40.573]  Don't call the Constitution a living document.
[03:42:40.633 --> 03:42:43.654]  I know that's a very dangerous thing to say.
[03:42:44.315 --> 03:42:45.796]  But there are things that evolve.
[03:42:46.276 --> 03:42:58.404]  And I'm telling you right now, when you have artificial intelligence, when you have cloning, GMOs, patent, copyright, you're going to have issues that are going to confound the average Joe.
[03:42:58.924 --> 03:43:00.165]  More coming up with me, Lionel.
[03:43:04.079 --> 03:43:17.044]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I mean, I could speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[03:43:17.325 --> 03:43:22.387]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:22.487 --> 03:43:27.889]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:28.769 --> 03:43:29.449]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:29.550 --> 03:43:32.711]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:33.371 --> 03:43:34.352]  And so much more.
[03:43:34.912 --> 03:43:36.033]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.253 --> 03:43:37.954]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:37.974 --> 03:43:43.677]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:43.797 --> 03:43:44.998]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:45.018 --> 03:43:46.939]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:47.039 --> 03:43:49.401]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:49.621 --> 03:43:50.881]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:51.062 --> 03:43:52.863]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:53.423 --> 03:43:54.023]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:54.123 --> 03:43:55.444]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:55.564 --> 03:43:56.745]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:07.179 --> 03:44:16.521]  A few years ago, ideas that we talked about were thought to be fringe ideas, radical ideas, extremist ideas.
[03:44:16.541 --> 03:44:19.081]  Those ideas are now mainstream.
[03:44:19.381 --> 03:44:22.922]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.
[03:44:23.002 --> 03:44:34.104]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[03:44:41.968 --> 03:44:45.810]  Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c***.
[03:44:45.930 --> 03:44:49.992]  What's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women?
[03:44:50.172 --> 03:44:54.594]  One way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy, so please bring on the recession.
[03:44:54.754 --> 03:44:58.516]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[03:44:58.696 --> 03:45:03.359]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[03:45:08.890 --> 03:45:13.187]  It has been said that the Republican Party's testicles just dropped.
[03:45:14.133 --> 03:45:17.175]  That wasn't an InfoWars.com ad you just saw.
[03:45:17.515 --> 03:45:19.636]  That was officially put out by the Republican Party.
[03:45:20.316 --> 03:45:33.702]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're finally getting the fact that the globalists are trying to start a violent revolution in this country and overthrow it and bring it down just like Venezuela and so many others that have fallen to socialism and communism.
[03:45:34.063 --> 03:45:38.825]  The globalists recognize that InfoWars has been on the very front lines of this global awakening.
[03:45:39.245 --> 03:45:47.671]  And they don't want us to be there as this fight intensifies to continue to rally free humans all over the planet against this diabolical globalist program.
[03:45:47.951 --> 03:45:55.136]  That's why it's more critical than ever that you understand that we are not supported by George Soros or any big banks or any big corporations.
[03:45:55.496 --> 03:46:01.180]  We are supported by you, the viewers, and the listeners that buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:01.580 --> 03:46:04.942]  We need to be reprovisioned in this fight.
[03:46:05.323 --> 03:46:07.064]  We need to be able to fund our operation.
[03:46:07.604 --> 03:46:08.585]  And we make it easy.
[03:46:09.445 --> 03:46:16.389]  With products like Super Blue, Fluoride Free, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Immune Gargle, and so much more.
[03:46:16.689 --> 03:46:18.050]  Fortified with Colloil Silver.
[03:46:19.130 --> 03:46:21.872]  Fortified with the highest quality iodine.
[03:46:22.292 --> 03:46:24.993]  Fortified with natural essential oils and more.
[03:46:25.654 --> 03:46:33.058]  You help your teeth, you help your body, you help your gums, you help your country, you help your planet through free market, free association.
[03:46:34.113 --> 03:46:40.719]  The products are 50% off right now going through our super sale that we're going to have on July 4th.
[03:46:41.279 --> 03:46:42.280]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:42.660 --> 03:46:43.701]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:46:44.122 --> 03:46:56.773]  This is where you finance the second American revolution with the United States now attempting to stop the global government empire, attempting to take back control of our destiny on a global scale.
[03:47:05.968 --> 03:47:10.190]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.254 --> 03:47:34.220]  How many line up with you?
[03:47:35.626 --> 03:47:39.789]  Please, absolutely effervescent being here today, and I thank you so much.
[03:47:39.849 --> 03:47:41.650]  By the way, this is for Roger Stone.
[03:47:41.690 --> 03:47:48.275]  I hope my cufflinks are not too garish for you, my sartorial sultan, you.
[03:47:48.295 --> 03:47:49.695]  I love that man.
[03:47:50.416 --> 03:47:51.537]  Now, a couple of things here.
[03:47:51.677 --> 03:47:57.460]  In New York this week, we had Alexandria Horacio Cortez.
[03:47:58.201 --> 03:48:03.484]  Alexandria Horacio, no, Ocasio, what am I saying?
[03:48:03.845 --> 03:48:04.345]  Cortez.
[03:48:05.632 --> 03:48:06.793]  Blew out Crowley.
[03:48:07.754 --> 03:48:09.055]  This is the greatest thing.
[03:48:09.075 --> 03:48:09.615]  Now, wait.
[03:48:10.816 --> 03:48:11.437]  I know what you're thinking.
[03:48:11.457 --> 03:48:12.337]  They're going crazy with her.
[03:48:12.838 --> 03:48:13.878]  There, look at that face!
[03:48:14.219 --> 03:48:17.581]  Meet the face of tyranny and suffering.
[03:48:18.322 --> 03:48:21.464]  Alex, the king of the understatement.
[03:48:22.565 --> 03:48:23.726]  Oh, Alex, yes.
[03:48:23.886 --> 03:48:25.367]  No, no, we need this.
[03:48:25.608 --> 03:48:30.872]  If you think Venezuela is awesome, you'll love Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[03:48:31.980 --> 03:48:42.704]  This is the greatest thing that's ever happening, because right now, they're sitting in the hallowed halls of the deep state saying, Holy God!
[03:48:43.805 --> 03:48:46.846]  What the hell is happening?
[03:48:47.186 --> 03:48:47.566]  Who?
[03:48:48.366 --> 03:48:48.967]  She's who?
[03:48:49.027 --> 03:48:50.787]  He's twice her age.
[03:48:50.847 --> 03:48:51.948]  Crowley's twice her age.
[03:48:52.328 --> 03:48:53.168]  Spenner, 18 to 1.
[03:48:55.740 --> 03:49:01.983]  And she basically said, I'm going to go out and I'm going to say some things on my own and I'm going to use my Twitter.
[03:49:02.203 --> 03:49:05.264]  She did a very, a great, great video.
[03:49:05.284 --> 03:49:06.945]  By the way, that MJ, what is it?
[03:49:07.005 --> 03:49:08.746]  Hagar, The Door.
[03:49:09.306 --> 03:49:11.167]  Did you see that video of the woman, The Door?
[03:49:11.807 --> 03:49:13.808]  This is some of the best stuff possible.
[03:49:14.468 --> 03:49:20.271]  So right now, Hillary Clinton and others, Debbie Wasserman-Jones and this crew are saying, what do we do?
[03:49:21.175 --> 03:49:22.116]  What do we do?
[03:49:22.656 --> 03:49:24.957]  And they're grooming her like, this is the future.
[03:49:24.977 --> 03:49:27.118]  They say, no, this is not the future.
[03:49:27.939 --> 03:49:31.461]  This is the greatest thing ever for Trump.
[03:49:31.961 --> 03:49:34.963]  Listen, I'm going to be honest with you.
[03:49:35.163 --> 03:49:38.264]  Or as my friend says, I'm going to be as honest as I possibly can be.
[03:49:38.564 --> 03:49:39.385]  Which I said, what?
[03:49:40.085 --> 03:49:44.928]  But I'm going to tell you, I'm not a doctrinaire
[03:49:45.752 --> 03:49:51.533]  Right-wing, left-wing, I know I'm mamby-pamby, I'm kind of in the... I don't have any names.
[03:49:52.233 --> 03:49:54.174]  I'm Carol Quigley all the way.
[03:49:54.394 --> 03:49:55.594]  Two sides of the same coin.
[03:49:56.074 --> 03:49:58.375]  The paradigm, the illusion of the left-right stuff.
[03:49:58.735 --> 03:49:59.895]  All these words mean nothing to me.
[03:50:00.255 --> 03:50:03.596]  Sometimes I agree with this one, I agree with that one, based upon the issue.
[03:50:03.636 --> 03:50:04.756]  But I don't have any label.
[03:50:05.476 --> 03:50:06.296]  But I will tell you this.
[03:50:08.257 --> 03:50:08.997]  I'm loving Trump.
[03:50:09.937 --> 03:50:10.877]  Oh my God!
[03:50:12.357 --> 03:50:15.258]  If you had told me that I'd be having this much fun,
[03:50:16.266 --> 03:50:19.428]  That I'd be having so much fun in this sick schadenfreude.
[03:50:19.788 --> 03:50:25.392]  My wife and I, we have these people, these ex-friends of ours, who are going crazy.
[03:50:26.553 --> 03:50:30.876]  And I have been portrayed by many people to be this right-winger.
[03:50:30.896 --> 03:50:31.656]  It's like, okay, fine.
[03:50:32.477 --> 03:50:37.980]  But this is going to play into the midterms, into Trump 2020.
[03:50:38.441 --> 03:50:41.763]  He's going to say, ladies and gentlemen, do you know what
[03:50:42.541 --> 03:50:43.521]  The Democrats are?
[03:50:44.061 --> 03:50:44.642]  Let me go to you.
[03:50:44.842 --> 03:50:46.622]  Mr. and Mrs. Mainstream America.
[03:50:46.802 --> 03:50:48.222]  Mr. and Mrs. Heartland.
[03:50:48.523 --> 03:50:52.324]  Mr. and Mrs. And by the way, the Heartland isn't Dubuque or Des Moines.
[03:50:52.384 --> 03:50:53.024]  It could be Brooklyn.
[03:50:53.064 --> 03:50:55.904]  It could be the Bronx, Kings County, Brooklyn.
[03:50:56.104 --> 03:50:58.405]  It can be, it's a mindset.
[03:50:58.705 --> 03:51:05.807]  It means the average, the Gaussian curve, just the middle, the bell curve, the middle, just the regular people.
[03:51:06.447 --> 03:51:08.067]  I'm going to say, you know what the Democratic Party is?
[03:51:08.107 --> 03:51:08.728]  Here, this is it.
[03:51:09.048 --> 03:51:09.868]  She wants to get rid of ICE.
[03:51:11.005 --> 03:51:21.523]  She wants to disband completely and enforcement, get this, she wants to get rid of that protector of your sovereignty!
[03:51:22.509 --> 03:51:23.649]  This is what she wants to do.
[03:51:23.890 --> 03:51:24.270]  Look at this.
[03:51:25.410 --> 03:51:26.490]  I mean, just go through the list.
[03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:29.512]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, you go ahead and you do this.
[03:51:29.932 --> 03:51:34.553]  And Hillary and others are going to be thinking, oh my God, this is not what we're doing.
[03:51:34.773 --> 03:51:39.615]  Because believe it or not, Crowley was more Trump than she is.
[03:51:40.175 --> 03:51:44.697]  Let them go far left and encourage it.
[03:51:45.527 --> 03:51:46.788]  Encourage her!
[03:51:47.248 --> 03:51:49.329]  Let her build up her cadre!
[03:51:49.609 --> 03:51:55.071]  Because where she also is, she appeals to the disenfranchised Bernie voter.
[03:51:55.872 --> 03:51:57.232]  See, this is the thing that is interesting.
[03:51:57.353 --> 03:52:03.936]  You know, Trump is going to one day do his version of the Southern strategy, but in a different way.
[03:52:04.316 --> 03:52:06.737]  He's going to go after the Millennial strategy.
[03:52:07.617 --> 03:52:09.758]  He's going to talk to them and he's going to say, let me explain something to you.
[03:52:09.818 --> 03:52:11.299]  You were left out by these people.
[03:52:11.986 --> 03:52:13.067]  You were basically hosed.
[03:52:13.127 --> 03:52:14.568]  Pardon my French, but you were hosed.
[03:52:14.588 --> 03:52:15.769]  You were betrayed!
[03:52:16.550 --> 03:52:19.312]  Betrayed by these people.
[03:52:19.372 --> 03:52:24.516]  You had your chance to feel like you had your candidate, Bernie.
[03:52:24.897 --> 03:52:25.657]  She's going to be what?
[03:52:26.017 --> 03:52:27.999]  Some ersatz version?
[03:52:28.239 --> 03:52:30.421]  Some synthetic knockoff of this?
[03:52:32.002 --> 03:52:35.565]  What we have in common is the middle class.
[03:52:35.925 --> 03:52:37.026]  Lowering your taxes.
[03:52:37.086 --> 03:52:41.290]  Getting rid of a trillion dollars of debt that your generation enjoys.
[03:52:42.521 --> 03:52:48.586]  I am telling you, you, you, people think I'm nuts, which I could be, but not for this reason.
[03:52:49.707 --> 03:53:10.104]  You're going to have Trump saying, listen to me, look what he's doing with Kanye, Candace Owens, with Minister Farrakhan, Minister Farrakhan, and I'm not endorsing, I'm not endorsing him, but he said, with Mr. Trump, our, his enemy is our enemy.
[03:53:10.970 --> 03:53:12.251]  The enemy of my enemy is my friend!
[03:53:12.871 --> 03:53:14.492]  Unbelievable!
[03:53:14.933 --> 03:53:18.555]  And Hillary's thinking, what the hell is going on here?
[03:53:19.856 --> 03:53:23.478]  Farrakhan, Kanye, Kandis, bring them all!
[03:53:23.498 --> 03:53:24.519]  You see what we have right here?
[03:53:24.999 --> 03:53:27.821]  I want a hip-hop summit!
[03:53:28.601 --> 03:53:34.745]  I want to have young people, African-American, Latinos, people of color, to say that Trump is cool!
[03:53:35.366 --> 03:53:37.067]  And Kandis, not Kandis, but
[03:53:38.104 --> 03:53:43.446]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not realistic!
[03:53:43.947 --> 03:53:47.208]  Yes, yes, she is young.
[03:53:47.488 --> 03:53:49.909]  Yes, but this is antediluvian!
[03:53:50.570 --> 03:53:55.612]  Her ideologies are olid, they're odious, they're useless!
[03:53:56.192 --> 03:53:57.192]  This isn't the way it works!
[03:53:57.693 --> 03:54:01.034]  And I also want this message to come out very, very loud and clear.
[03:54:01.374 --> 03:54:04.456]  And this is the part, going back to the... Because remember, this is 14% of the population.
[03:54:05.916 --> 03:54:06.496]  African Americans, 14%.
[03:54:06.536 --> 03:54:08.457]  This is serious!
[03:54:09.117 --> 03:54:09.977]  This is serious!
[03:54:10.597 --> 03:54:11.777]  There's no reason for us to fight.
[03:54:11.817 --> 03:54:15.018]  Look, I'm Donald Trump and you think I'm some kind of antithetical.
[03:54:15.058 --> 03:54:16.538]  Trust me, we're on the same page.
[03:54:17.358 --> 03:54:23.760]  And think about this, the only reason they even care about these unaccompanied children, the only reason they care about is one particular reason.
[03:54:23.980 --> 03:54:25.260]  Because they've squandered your vote.
[03:54:25.600 --> 03:54:27.501]  Your vote, Latino votes, people of color.
[03:54:29.541 --> 03:54:33.722]  Not that everybody who's poor is a Democrat, but they have written you off!
[03:54:34.699 --> 03:54:35.900]  Now let me ask you this hypothetical.
[03:54:36.320 --> 03:54:37.981]  Don't you love thought experiments?
[03:54:38.261 --> 03:54:38.621]  I do.
[03:54:39.261 --> 03:54:43.403]  Assume, as we lawyers say, arguendo, for the sake of argument.
[03:54:43.563 --> 03:54:45.564]  Assume the following.
[03:54:46.505 --> 03:54:48.326]  What would happen if Trump could say this?
[03:54:48.726 --> 03:54:49.686]  All right, I'll make a deal with you.
[03:54:50.427 --> 03:54:53.888]  Chuck Schumer and Sotomayor or whatever, everybody comes in.
[03:54:54.368 --> 03:54:56.910]  In fact, you just point to them and they come in.
[03:54:57.090 --> 03:54:58.410]  I'll give them each a thousand dollars.
[03:54:58.690 --> 03:54:59.231]  Come on in.
[03:54:59.691 --> 03:55:01.832]  Accompanied, unaccompanied, I don't care.
[03:55:02.252 --> 03:55:03.813]  Oh, but there's only one condition.
[03:55:05.200 --> 03:55:06.261]  And you do want them in, right?
[03:55:06.601 --> 03:55:06.942]  Oh, yes.
[03:55:07.142 --> 03:55:09.144]  You do want them in, not the political regions?
[03:55:09.204 --> 03:55:09.964]  Oh, no, no.
[03:55:10.004 --> 03:55:10.225]  Good.
[03:55:10.725 --> 03:55:11.786]  They have to sign a waiver.
[03:55:11.826 --> 03:55:13.067]  They have to pledge never to vote.
[03:55:14.048 --> 03:55:18.352]  They have to give up their right to ever seek the franchise.
[03:55:18.932 --> 03:55:21.855]  They can come in here, but we're going to clip their voting wings.
[03:55:21.935 --> 03:55:23.897]  They can not vote.
[03:55:24.597 --> 03:55:25.318]  What do you think would happen?
[03:55:27.216 --> 03:55:30.417]  Schumer, and these people would say, are you out of your mind?
[03:55:30.457 --> 03:55:31.277]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[03:55:31.317 --> 03:55:31.837]  What happened?
[03:55:31.897 --> 03:55:32.397]  Wait a minute!
[03:55:32.817 --> 03:55:34.138]  You were worried about the humanity, right?
[03:55:34.298 --> 03:55:35.218]  I'm saying bring them in!
[03:55:35.818 --> 03:55:36.378]  Open the doors!
[03:55:36.418 --> 03:55:37.478]  Let a man take care of them!
[03:55:37.638 --> 03:55:38.158]  Love them!
[03:55:39.559 --> 03:55:40.199]  What are you doing?
[03:55:40.219 --> 03:55:41.859]  They're going to say, we don't care about them!
[03:55:42.599 --> 03:55:44.620]  And by the way, let me also say something very, very quickly.
[03:55:46.440 --> 03:55:49.541]  There was a time in the 80s in Florida, where I'm from,
[03:55:50.470 --> 03:56:02.035]  And when the Mariel Boatlift was there, the Marielitos, as they were called, in Miami, Chrome Avenue Detention Center, you probably remember this, they were people who came, and Castro was a genius.
[03:56:02.475 --> 03:56:12.439]  He emptied his prisons, mental hospitals, oh, he got rid of the, it was the brain drain during the 50s and 60s, but this was just, not everybody,
[03:56:13.174 --> 03:56:21.159]  Don't get upset, but a lot of people that frankly he just figured I'm gonna I'm gonna clean out the loony bin and the who's gal and let him go.
[03:56:21.819 --> 03:56:32.745]  Because when you're standing there at the Mariel Harbor waiting for your Uncle Guzman you're waiting and they're saying no no you got to take this these people because your uncle is on the other boat just get out.
[03:56:33.706 --> 03:56:39.729]  People would come back to West Coast Miami and Tampa and realize that their loved ones were never picked up.
[03:56:39.749 --> 03:56:40.770]  All right suffice it to say
[03:56:42.404 --> 03:56:51.866]  In those camps, the amount of pederasty, pedophilia, child sex trafficking, bartering was because the children were kept together.
[03:56:52.866 --> 03:56:56.867]  When you keep them together, that's when they're preyed upon.
[03:56:57.507 --> 03:56:59.207]  Now, I've hit you with a lot of stuff.
[03:56:59.548 --> 03:57:02.128]  I've hit you with so much stuff right now, it's unbelievable.
[03:57:02.388 --> 03:57:05.129]  And frankly, I understand that it can be a bit daunting.
[03:57:05.469 --> 03:57:07.709]  Don't be daunted by this.
[03:57:08.109 --> 03:57:09.029]  Understand one thing.
[03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:11.330]  Critical thinking is going to set you free.
[03:57:12.057 --> 03:57:14.379]  This is not about left and right.
[03:57:14.720 --> 03:57:16.882]  This is not even about Democrats and Republicans.
[03:57:17.302 --> 03:57:18.383]  This is about truth.
[03:57:19.024 --> 03:57:21.727]  This is about the success of our republic.
[03:57:22.227 --> 03:57:24.049]  This is about the future of this country.
[03:57:24.429 --> 03:57:26.371]  You can't say that enough.
[03:57:26.872 --> 03:57:31.176]  It may sound corny to the uninitiated, but believe me when I'm telling you this.
[03:57:32.297 --> 03:57:33.879]  We're in a fight for our lives.
[03:57:34.776 --> 03:57:36.097]  And we're not going to get another chance.
[03:57:36.117 --> 03:57:37.559]  So all I'm saying is this.
[03:57:37.919 --> 03:57:38.539]  Open your head.
[03:57:39.160 --> 03:57:39.781]  Open your heart.
[03:57:40.121 --> 03:57:40.902]  And open your mind.
[03:57:41.222 --> 03:57:44.225]  And realize the number one thing I'm after is truth.
[03:57:45.145 --> 03:57:47.207]  And comment as you see fit.
[03:57:52.721 --> 03:58:01.049]  I don't know how you feel about this, but keep a gun in your house, and if you think someone's gonna assault you, or rape you, blow their head off, man!
[03:58:11.009 --> 03:58:12.930]  Kinnison was born in Peoria, Illinois.
[03:58:13.191 --> 03:58:17.434]  He died when a pickup truck slammed into his car near Needles, California last night.
[03:58:17.534 --> 03:58:22.717]  The body of Nirvana's lead singer and songwriter was found today in a guest cottage at his Seattle home.
[03:58:23.258 --> 03:58:27.381]  The medical examiner says he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
[03:58:27.581 --> 03:58:30.263]  All of a sudden, police brutality had a human face.
[03:58:30.603 --> 03:58:36.007]  The face belonged to Rodney King, a black male being brutally beaten and touched by Los Angeles police officers.
[03:58:40.494 --> 03:58:42.515]  Oh, look at that.
[03:58:43.116 --> 03:58:43.596]  Terrible!
[03:58:43.936 --> 03:58:45.697]  And there's no police presence down here.
[03:58:45.857 --> 03:58:46.857]  Nobody's helping us.
[03:58:46.897 --> 03:58:48.398]  This is attempted murder.
[03:58:48.598 --> 03:58:55.142]  The three merchants walked out of the stores and they just started firing at everybody and anybody.
