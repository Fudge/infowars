[00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:25.004]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:29.887]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:34.149]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:36.169]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:40.972]  We are drugged out!
[00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:43.893]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.273]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:49.374]  Today it all changes.
[00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:52.175]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:55.296]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:00:55.516 --> 00:00:59.958]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:02.900]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.461]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:07.702]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.622]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:10.983]  We have the resources.
[00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:17.872]  Well sometimes you need some crazy motherf***** to change something.
[00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:20.953]  Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all on Steve Jobs phones.
[00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:25.355]  They say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love.
[00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:29.176]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:01:30.577 --> 00:01:34.238]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:01:34.818 --> 00:01:36.599]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:46.350]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[00:01:46.730 --> 00:02:01.955]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:13.519]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.042]  While the old guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape rocked by innovation and technology,
[00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:24.265]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:36.353]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[00:02:37.413 --> 00:02:46.880]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.020]  Demand truth.
[00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:49.682]  Demand InfoWars.
[00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:52.384]  InfoWars.
[00:02:52.764 --> 00:02:54.365]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:02:54.385 --> 00:03:13.980]  I do a lot of preparation for the broadcast at home, and I also do it here, but I, for the first time in 23 years on air, don't even know if I can do this show today because
[00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:21.029]  I don't want to not do justice to each piece of news, and this is the information apocalypse.
[00:03:24.573 --> 00:03:28.077]  A lot of people have asked, why haven't you covered the Boy Scouts allowing girls in?
[00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:34.613]  But then the boys don't get to get in the girls.
[00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:41.597]  Or why haven't you covered they're gonna hand out condoms to children at the Boy Scout Jamboree and alcohol's gonna be served.
[00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:45.179]  And that it basically has become a pedophile orgy.
[00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.180]  I mean, that's confirmed.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.801]  Just like the Vatican.
[00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:50.682]  There's that whole story.
[00:03:52.163 --> 00:03:58.067]  And then we've got Travis Knight, one of our crew members, just himself went into Starbucks
[00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:03.184]  And said, hey, promo code racism, give me a free coffee, and they gave it to him.
[00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:04.365]  That's a gigantic story.
[00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:05.445]  Everything that's connected to that.
[00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:07.747]  The whole North Korea thing.
[00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.132]  Australia's had to issue no-go zones because of Muslim areas for paramedics.
[00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:26.339]  You've got State Department issuing warnings after employees hit by sonic weapons that brain damage them.
[00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:29.241]  That's in CNN today.
[00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:33.401]  But yesterday, you've got ThinkProgress making fun of me.
[00:04:35.082 --> 00:04:36.702]  Just showing the CIA documents.
[00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:41.625]  And showing it from the National Institutes and from DARPA.
[00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:43.466]  DARP-Gov.
[00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:44.847]  I mean, see, that's what they do.
[00:04:44.907 --> 00:04:46.868]  It's their wall of disinfo.
[00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:48.289]  Unbelievable.
[00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.071]  You got Bloomberg saying raise taxes on poor people.
[00:04:55.893 --> 00:04:57.774]  Which is known in economics to keep them poor.
[00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.270]  It's just incredible.
[00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.591]  These people are so evil.
[00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:12.279]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:20.585]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:25.409]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:32.333]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:32.413 --> 00:05:39.497]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:05:39.577 --> 00:05:46.461]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:50.964]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:05:51.104 --> 00:05:54.286]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:05:54.466 --> 00:06:00.610]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.451]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:57.744 --> 00:07:02.191]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.332 --> 00:07:03.894]  Move bitch!
[00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:05.056]  Get out of the way!
[00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:13.351]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:07:13.452 --> 00:07:16.234]  I will not let you down.
[00:07:16.634 --> 00:07:20.698]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:24.461]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:07:27.404 --> 00:07:30.065]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:34.966]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:07:35.127 --> 00:07:37.667]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:40.288]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:07:41.348 --> 00:07:52.012]  I was watching live footage of Trump walking through the White House lawn getting ready to
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.542]  Jump on a helicopter and go to his MS-13 conference.
[00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:06.485]  And he was skipping and smiling and waving at the military people.
[00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:08.486]  You very rarely see Trump smile.
[00:08:09.386 --> 00:08:15.188]  But he had a little corner of his mouth, satisfied, delicious smirk this morning.
[00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:17.309]  We're going to find that video.
[00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:19.170]  I was on the elliptical when I saw it.
[00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:22.781]  That's when I tend to flip around and watch the news, mainstream news.
[00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:24.422]  I was watching Fox.
[00:08:25.303 --> 00:08:26.263]  It's about 8.30 this morning.
[00:08:29.306 --> 00:08:33.989]  But, like I told you yesterday, the worm has turned, the tide has turned.
[00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:36.551]  The deep state's back is broken.
[00:08:37.612 --> 00:08:48.320]  And we have a very good opportunity, once these folks are routed out and prosecuted, to really reform all the illegal spying and the new royalty that has been set up
[00:08:49.682 --> 00:08:50.863]  In Washington, D.C.
[00:08:52.423 --> 00:08:58.585]  And the people that are so arrogant that they say, oh, we were spying on Trump.
[00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:01.747]  Clapper said this on The View.
[00:09:05.448 --> 00:09:09.410]  We were spying on Trump for his own good.
[00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.211]  After you lied to Congress and said you weren't.
[00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:15.252]  Did you lie to Congress for her own good, too?
[00:09:23.044 --> 00:09:28.065]  He just disintegrated on The View, and Joy Behar went further.
[00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:36.147]  She said, well, America and the Trump campaign should be thankful that you were spying on him.
[00:09:40.189 --> 00:09:45.530]  These guys have the stink of failure and the stink of implosion about them, don't they?
[00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.372]  Oh, you want to see people locked up?
[00:09:48.873 --> 00:09:50.294]  There's a different sheriff in town.
[00:09:51.175 --> 00:10:01.086]  And I can guarantee you that when we're done, these people are all going to be totally humiliated and they're going to have choices.
[00:10:02.828 --> 00:10:08.574]  They're either going to go to prison or they can get in the bathtub and slit their wrist.
[00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:27.146]  Within, I'd say six months, when they lose those midterms, they'll be given the ultimatum, we're ready to destroy you publicly and have a full war, tear you apart, quote Giuliani.
[00:10:29.548 --> 00:10:38.534]  Or, you need to start sucking on the barrel of a big old fat juicy firearm.
[00:10:41.355 --> 00:10:41.796]  Just saying.
[00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:45.490]  And I wish no harm upon these scumbags.
[00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:50.512]  And they're so arrogant, they've got some of the personnel to do it, to launch some false flags.
[00:10:50.812 --> 00:10:54.694]  But they're too scared to give the orders themselves, because they know they're compromised now.
[00:10:55.234 --> 00:10:56.315]  They know they're being watched now.
[00:10:59.076 --> 00:11:09.461]  And, can somebody go to the store, they sell them at Hobby Lobby, and get me... I want to get a bunch of hourglasses, actually.
[00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:11.682]  Just symbolizing in here.
[00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:16.631]  So that as we do the broadcast every day, we just cut the camera to the sand running through it.
[00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:23.955]  Because I smell blood in the water.
[00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:29.288]  I smell thrashing!
[00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:33.010]  And here comes... Baby Shark!
[00:11:35.052 --> 00:11:35.592]  Baby Shark!
[00:11:35.793 --> 00:11:38.655]  And then there's Mama Shark!
[00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:39.856]  Mama Shark!
[00:11:39.936 --> 00:11:40.696]  Daddy Shark!
[00:11:41.237 --> 00:11:42.618]  Daddy Shark's coming!
[00:11:42.778 --> 00:11:45.700]  And they thought they could hurt Baby Sharks!
[00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.378]  And scare Papa Shark away.
[00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.260]  That's not how it works, because sharks don't have fear.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.901]  Sharks go in to the blood.
[00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:07.802]  In to the feast.
[00:12:08.202 --> 00:12:09.162]  In to the thrashing.
[00:12:09.403 --> 00:12:11.483]  Sometimes they get so excited, they bite each other!
[00:12:11.504 --> 00:12:13.164]  That's okay.
[00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:25.190]  Because at the end of the day, the big, fat, rotting, stinking, bloated, demonic whale that is the New World Order is going down, down, down to David Jones' locker.
[00:12:28.186 --> 00:12:29.127]  You can feel it?
[00:12:30.988 --> 00:12:33.089]  It's a spiritual change in the wind.
[00:12:33.229 --> 00:12:33.749]  It's here.
[00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:39.792]  And the president was just skipping along like suddenly he had 200 pounds off his back.
[00:12:39.852 --> 00:12:42.274]  Like he was just flying along.
[00:12:48.177 --> 00:12:49.818]  The globalists really miscalculated.
[00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:57.302]  They thought that
[00:13:02.383 --> 00:13:06.726]  They could intimidate everyone forever, and they thought they could finally plunge the whole country.
[00:13:06.766 --> 00:13:13.091]  So when we come back, I'm going to give you the absolute inside baseball from my own analysis and research and sources.
[00:13:14.152 --> 00:13:15.693]  The sources are just icing on the cake.
[00:13:16.294 --> 00:13:17.294]  InfoWars is the source.
[00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:23.779]  From intelligence and historical research and understanding and deep, multi-dimensional grasp.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.801]  We are the source.
[00:13:25.981 --> 00:13:26.922]  We are the detonator.
[00:13:27.222 --> 00:13:27.943]  We are the weapon.
[00:13:28.723 --> 00:13:29.504]  The enemy knows that.
[00:13:32.944 --> 00:13:36.346]  We're going to break down the big secrets of this whole thing when we come back.
[00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:42.009]  Exactly why the real deep state turned against the Democrats, the Globalists, and the Chinese takeover.
[00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:45.571]  And how it's all burning down to the ground beautifully right now.
[00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:51.795]  Now, we have a new product I'm going to launch, coming up, towards the end of the hour.
[00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:56.857]  But, this is how sometimes special sales hang over.
[00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:57.698]  They've not removed.
[00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:01.106]  Yet, it's going to be removed tonight.
[00:14:01.246 --> 00:14:08.950]  The 50% off, the high quality, fluoride free, toothpaste, super blue, for adults and children, two different types.
[00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.031]  And then the immune gargle, it's so amazing.
[00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:13.533]  And then of course the mouthwash, it's amazing as well.
[00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:15.094]  4 to 5 quartals of silver and iodine.
[00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:20.177]  It's all there at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:14:20.197 --> 00:14:21.517]  That special will end.
[00:14:25.916 --> 00:14:28.598]  We're a little slow sometimes taking the specials down because we've got so much going on here.
[00:14:29.198 --> 00:14:30.399]  But that's 50% off still.
[00:14:30.699 --> 00:14:35.143]  Free shipping when you order the entire combo pack of six different items.
[00:14:35.743 --> 00:14:42.908]  The three immune gargle sizes, the mouthwash, and of course the adult and children's super blue fluoride free concentrated toothpaste.
[00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:48.332]  That's 50% off individually or together but with the combo pack there's free shipping.
[00:14:48.532 --> 00:14:50.414]  All orders above $50 have free shipping.
[00:14:51.784 --> 00:14:54.628]  Also, there's a bunch of other big specials, like bodies.
[00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:58.933]  Strongest, best type of system we could come up with.
[00:14:59.834 --> 00:15:04.180]  The very, very, very, very best turmeric, strongest we could come up with.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.142]  95% curcumin, and that's top of the line.
[00:15:06.523 --> 00:15:07.224]  Very, very proud of it.
[00:15:07.264 --> 00:15:09.367]  That's 50% off, a great deal.
[00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.747]  If you don't know about the benefits of turmeric, well, they're legendary.
[00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:15.028]  Just research it.
[00:15:15.169 --> 00:15:19.956]  This is the best, best, best we could go out and research in the industry and bring to you.
[00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:21.558]  Infoworkstore.com.
[00:15:21.598 --> 00:15:23.200]  Read all those five-star reviews as well.
[00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:24.182]  That's gonna end.
[00:15:25.512 --> 00:15:27.454]  25% off on Survival Shield X2.
[00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:28.895]  That's going to have to end next week.
[00:15:29.215 --> 00:15:35.801]  But you can get it 50% off when you get it in the combo pack with BioTrue Selenium, the organic type from the mustard seeds.
[00:15:35.821 --> 00:15:37.202]  I'm saying it's organically derived.
[00:15:37.222 --> 00:15:46.350]  A lot of the synthetic stuff out there from my own personal research, and people know this, doesn't work like the real organically extracted does.
[00:15:47.591 --> 00:15:50.633]  That's 6,000 plus reviews for X2 at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:58.416]  And when you fund us, you stand in the gap against the enemy trying to financially squeeze us, censor us, sue us, and crush us as we break their will.
[00:15:58.956 --> 00:15:59.816]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:00.857]  Stay with us.
[00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:22.443]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:22.543 --> 00:16:28.446]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:28.826 --> 00:16:29.786]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:30.186 --> 00:16:32.768]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:33.428 --> 00:16:34.389]  And so much more.
[00:16:34.969 --> 00:16:36.090]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.031]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:43.734]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:43.854 --> 00:16:45.055]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:46.996]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:47.096 --> 00:16:49.477]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:49.677 --> 00:16:50.938]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.118 --> 00:16:52.919]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:54.080]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.501]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:55.621 --> 00:16:56.801]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:02.338 --> 00:17:11.624]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:18.749]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:26.854]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:17:27.674 --> 00:17:32.917]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:17:33.537 --> 00:17:45.664]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:17:46.204 --> 00:17:46.684]  Mike in Arizona.
[00:17:46.704 --> 00:17:48.426]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:17:48.466 --> 00:17:48.946]  Go ahead.
[00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:07.066]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:16.517]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:21.003]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:18:21.443 --> 00:18:21.703]  Absolutely.
[00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:57.154]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:19:01.898 --> 00:19:03.860]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.280]  Go ahead.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.742]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:09.845]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.741]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:13.803]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:14.503 --> 00:19:16.565]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:20.809]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:23.331]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:26.473]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:26.814 --> 00:19:27.935]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:28.175 --> 00:19:29.056]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:30.337]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:30.757 --> 00:19:31.798]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:32.919]  Put him on pause again.
[00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:33.760]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:39.404]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:39.704 --> 00:19:43.988]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:44.228 --> 00:19:47.091]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:47.751]  You understand?
[00:19:47.831 --> 00:19:49.112]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:49.473 --> 00:19:50.634]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:51.594 --> 00:19:56.498]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:19:57.439 --> 00:19:58.180]  Do you understand?
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.361]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:20:06.357 --> 00:20:09.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:27.756]  I don't think the globalists, Deep State, should be too scared.
[00:20:29.498 --> 00:20:30.519]  I don't think they should
[00:20:32.842 --> 00:20:33.504]  Fear the Reaper.
[00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:41.881]  It's gonna be good for their old rotting power structure to be cut out like a diseased cancer that was trying to metastasize and bring the country down.
[00:20:43.516 --> 00:20:45.938]  We're going to destroy you one way or another.
[00:20:45.998 --> 00:20:48.140]  We don't care what you do to us individually.
[00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:49.081]  Figure that out.
[00:20:49.161 --> 00:20:50.282]  Your will is broken.
[00:20:51.163 --> 00:20:52.384]  We have broken your will.
[00:20:52.745 --> 00:20:54.006]  The country's already coming back.
[00:20:54.506 --> 00:20:57.129]  Your foot on our neck is now being removed.
[00:20:57.489 --> 00:21:07.218]  And all of your flailing and race war garbage and sex war garbage and all of it is only waking people up to how deranged you really are.
[00:21:07.578 --> 00:21:09.260]  Thank you for showing us your real nature.
[00:21:12.586 --> 00:21:14.127]  Gloves are off, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:14.527 --> 00:21:15.207]  Spygate.
[00:21:16.007 --> 00:21:17.227]  He dubs it Spygate.
[00:21:17.287 --> 00:21:18.688]  Who dubbed that?
[00:21:18.708 --> 00:21:20.769]  Because we're pulling the video up.
[00:21:20.889 --> 00:21:22.669]  We've got the date of when I said it last year.
[00:21:23.009 --> 00:21:25.170]  I dubbed it Spygate because that's what it is.
[00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.271]  Oh, and the president's now dubbed it Spygate because that's what it is.
[00:21:31.652 --> 00:21:32.212]  Spygate.
[00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.093]  Trump blasts criminal deep state.
[00:21:41.835 --> 00:21:46.181]  A huge counterintelligence operation was deployed against the campaign.
[00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.042]  And who directed it?
[00:21:47.382 --> 00:21:50.586]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.749]  And powers.
[00:21:55.532 --> 00:21:56.533]  And rice.
[00:21:58.663 --> 00:21:59.524]  We have you now.
[00:22:00.284 --> 00:22:05.669]  And you all perjured yourselves to Congress and everybody else saying it didn't happen.
[00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:13.315]  And you were so arrogant, though, when you were telling the electors not to seat the delegates for the president in early January of last year.
[00:22:14.016 --> 00:22:24.045]  You said, don't worry, we've got proof from spying on him that he's a Russian agent and that women urinated all over him and all the rest of it when you paid your own family members.
[00:22:24.685 --> 00:22:26.026]  To manufacture the dossier.
[00:22:26.247 --> 00:22:31.291]  You got paid millions to produce the Bravo Sierra.
[00:22:33.293 --> 00:22:40.680]  And now, Twitter has shadow-banned the President, where people don't get the push notifications.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.824]  You don't find out when the President tweets back at you, in about 95% of the cases.
[00:22:45.244 --> 00:22:48.648]  But still, the whole world's able to read it and find out.
[00:22:50.123 --> 00:22:56.604]  And when we're done turning the economy back on and removing the traitors at the top, Twitter, Facebook, all you guys.
[00:22:58.305 --> 00:22:58.965]  You're gonna get it.
[00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:01.825]  Oh, and that powerful footage we're gonna play later.
[00:23:02.325 --> 00:23:03.886]  Paul played it yesterday in the fourth hour.
[00:23:04.086 --> 00:23:04.526]  Unbelievable.
[00:23:04.566 --> 00:23:08.467]  Nigel Farage at point-blank range.
[00:23:11.167 --> 00:23:11.947]  Point-blank range.
[00:23:14.028 --> 00:23:15.388]  In Zuckerberg's face.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:28.924]  Saying you are censoring me, you're censoring libertarians, conservatives and nationalists, and we need an Internet Bill of Rights for free speech, like the United States has, for the entire world.
[00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:40.549]  Countering the Chinese censorship, and Zuckerberg was so swollen and arrogant during it, but he had glints of fear in his eyes, and he would not respond to the question.
[00:23:41.314 --> 00:23:42.235]  He wrote it down.
[00:23:43.075 --> 00:23:46.377]  He said, I will respond later if I feel like it.
[00:23:46.738 --> 00:23:47.258]  When he was there.
[00:23:47.858 --> 00:23:48.999]  So there couldn't be a back and forth.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.641]  And then later he didn't address it.
[00:23:53.102 --> 00:23:56.124]  Other than saying, no one's censoring conservatives.
[00:24:00.847 --> 00:24:02.268]  When I try to send out a tweet,
[00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:05.084]  It holds it for an hour.
[00:24:05.804 --> 00:24:08.066]  I sent out any other link, it goes out instantly.
[00:24:08.326 --> 00:24:16.391]  It holds it for an hour, somebody looks at it and reviews it, and either won't let it be sent out, or shadowbans it and then it'll have like five retweets.
[00:24:16.652 --> 00:24:18.092]  Used to have like 10,000 on everything.
[00:24:18.953 --> 00:24:23.216]  Paul Watson, cannot tweet InfoWars.com now without it being blocked.
[00:24:24.216 --> 00:24:24.537]  Same thing.
[00:24:26.778 --> 00:24:30.861]  But Zuckerberg just told the EU Parliament, yesterday,
[00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:34.678]  We don't censor anybody, what are you talking about?
[00:24:34.698 --> 00:25:01.585]  Now I've told you that I am going to, in this segment, I told you I was going to break down how the globalists operate, their larger plan, and why Trump and the patriots in our government
[00:25:02.639 --> 00:25:06.661]  And the American people are in a total death battle with the globalists.
[00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:13.564]  And I'm going to go into how the whole Spygate situation began, how the whole situation unfolded, and where it's going.
[00:25:13.584 --> 00:25:15.545]  And I'm going to make another big announcement.
[00:25:15.565 --> 00:25:19.647]  But I'm going to do it at the beginning of the next segment, because I've already burned too much time in this one.
[00:25:22.108 --> 00:25:25.489]  But let me just go ahead and show you this little delicious tidbit.
[00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.610]  Look at this article.
[00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.452]  If you're a TV viewer or radio listeners, I'll obviously read it to you.
[00:25:33.126 --> 00:25:58.585]  From last year on April 23rd, from Nation News Today, it's the first place you see the term Spygate used on the internet in conjunction with
[00:26:00.154 --> 00:26:01.174]  Illegal spying on Trump.
[00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:03.195]  And then of course, who do they source?
[00:26:03.415 --> 00:26:04.696]  The video, which we're pulling up.
[00:26:05.496 --> 00:26:07.337]  Infowars.com.
[00:26:10.138 --> 00:26:11.939]  Infowars.com, right here.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.361]  And my breakdown, calling it SpyGate.
[00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:15.801]  Boom.
[00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:18.442]  Just pointing out why the globals hate me so much, okay?
[00:26:19.303 --> 00:26:21.964]  Infowars launched the term SpyGate.
[00:26:23.044 --> 00:26:24.805]  I remember at the time calling it SpyGate.
[00:26:24.825 --> 00:26:25.986]  I remember saying, what do we call it?
[00:26:26.006 --> 00:26:26.626]  What do we call it?
[00:26:27.773 --> 00:26:29.975]  Deep Stategate, Spygate, and I said, no, it's Spygate.
[00:26:31.176 --> 00:26:33.619]  And now the President's calling it Spygate because that's what it is.
[00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:34.840]  It's what it is.
[00:26:35.521 --> 00:26:41.807]  Thousands of times bigger than what happened in Watergate.
[00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:47.652]  And it just absolutely has devastated the globalists.
[00:26:47.712 --> 00:26:50.115]  And Trump, I was told a year ago, or more,
[00:26:51.263 --> 00:26:54.805]  Was setting them up and letting them perjure themselves on Spygate.
[00:26:55.626 --> 00:27:09.334]  And I know, I personally, I know Roger Stone personally, in January, told the President over and over and over again, Mr. President, you're going to bring them down with their illegal spying on you.
[00:27:10.675 --> 00:27:17.419]  They went and lied to the FISA Court and the FISA Court months later put out the report saying exactly that and it got zero coverage.
[00:27:18.629 --> 00:27:20.650]  So that's why this is so huge, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:21.830]  It's not about us getting credit.
[00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:26.151]  Why do you think Soros and Hillary and all them hate us and want us shut down?
[00:27:26.572 --> 00:27:40.176]  Because they know that this audience of activists and patriots, this college of ideas, the guest, the people we have, this crew, our researchers, all of InfoWars, is the silver bullet for the werewolf.
[00:27:40.296 --> 00:27:42.917]  I mean, it's the cross and holy water to Count Dracula.
[00:27:44.177 --> 00:27:45.858]  It's the kryptonite to their evil.
[00:27:47.216 --> 00:27:52.921]  So please pray for us, and please pray for the President, but I'm telling you, they'll never recover from this.
[00:27:52.961 --> 00:27:55.604]  Their system's exposed, how they operate's exposed.
[00:27:55.624 --> 00:27:58.066]  This is already bigger than Watergate on the Democrats.
[00:27:58.407 --> 00:28:07.295]  It's unraveling at a massive rate of speed, but we're in a very dangerous position right now because they have nothing to lose.
[00:28:07.535 --> 00:28:08.176]  But look at this tweet.
[00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:12.964]  Look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state.
[00:28:13.604 --> 00:28:23.666]  They go after phony collusion with Russia and made up scam and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal, the likes of which this country may have never seen before.
[00:28:24.386 --> 00:28:26.566]  What goes around comes around.
[00:28:30.807 --> 00:28:33.568]  Mr. President, the key is the illegal spy operation against you.
[00:28:33.608 --> 00:28:34.408]  It's still ongoing.
[00:28:34.568 --> 00:28:36.188]  The key is going after them.
[00:28:36.588 --> 00:28:37.529]  Very interesting, Alex.
[00:28:37.569 --> 00:28:38.349]  Hold on one second.
[00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:39.449]  Alex!
[00:28:40.689 --> 00:28:40.949]  Wow.
[00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.749]  Whoa.
[00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:43.650]  Where are you getting this?
[00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.790]  Because, let me tell you, alright?
[00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.851]  You're dead on.
[00:28:47.891 --> 00:28:48.892]  Well, yes, Mr. President.
[00:28:48.912 --> 00:28:50.712]  I mean, obviously, they've been spying on you the whole time.
[00:28:51.292 --> 00:28:51.992]  And it's totally illegal.
[00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:52.913]  You can blow the whole thing wide open.
[00:28:53.593 --> 00:28:55.313]  Alex, I just want you to keep it up.
[00:28:56.114 --> 00:28:56.974]  Just keep it up.
[00:28:57.034 --> 00:28:58.695]  Don't stop one thing you're doing.
[00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:00.455]  And I said, yes, sir.
[00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:06.637]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement.
[00:29:08.783 --> 00:29:23.813]  We are launching our biggest recruitment and hiring operation ever in our 23-year history as we prepare to go 24 hours a day live on TV and radio from the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, Texas.

[00:30:26.505 --> 00:30:36.131]  It has a massive effect and you've seen many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others they weren't even contest winners but they were runner-uppers.
[00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:53.961]  But even if you don't want to be part of the contest and just want a shot at working here, we're looking for camera people, we're looking for video editors, we're looking for investigative journalists, and we're looking for engineers, we're looking for reporters, we're looking for it all in this major push against the globalists.

[00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:04.367]  But it's critical that as fast as you can, you get your portfolio, your reel, into us.
[00:31:04.427 --> 00:31:07.489]  Whether it be in radio, whether it be in print, whether it be in film.

[00:31:12.193 --> 00:31:15.655]  So this is a very, very exciting chance for InfoWars.
[00:31:16.075 --> 00:31:20.716]  To up our game in the face of the globalists but for you to also be a part of this operation.
[00:31:20.996 --> 00:31:28.238]  So directly apply to work with us or apply and at the same time get involved in the contest.
[00:31:28.298 --> 00:31:29.398]  It's all up to you.
[00:31:29.918 --> 00:31:32.579]  We are expanding in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[00:31:32.939 --> 00:31:34.159]  We are not victims.
[00:31:34.339 --> 00:31:35.580]  We are victorious.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.881]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:45.622]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color and creed who love liberty that want to join the fight.
[00:31:46.123 --> 00:31:50.051]  Again, InfoWars.com forward slash contest to find all the rules.
[00:31:50.652 --> 00:31:54.921]  And I'll see you on the front lines of the fight against the NWO.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.683]  The President of the United States is racist.
[00:32:06.383 --> 00:32:07.164]  He's a punk.
[00:32:08.105 --> 00:32:08.865]  He's a dog.
[00:32:09.686 --> 00:32:10.367]  He's a pig.
[00:32:10.547 --> 00:32:11.427]  And he can suck my f***ing d***.
[00:32:12.248 --> 00:32:14.730]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:19.334]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, d*** sucker.
[00:32:19.374 --> 00:32:20.795]  The President of the United States
[00:32:21.756 --> 00:32:25.218]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[00:32:25.338 --> 00:32:30.920]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.540]  This is CNN.
[00:32:42.934 --> 00:32:46.595]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:48.903]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:49.323 --> 00:34:03.132]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:34:03.573 --> 00:34:09.537]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide and the great ring of fire around the Pacific Ocean
[00:34:10.811 --> 00:34:13.392]  It's the most active it's ever been in modern history.
[00:34:14.232 --> 00:34:26.375]  And historians have pointed out that back in ancient times, when you saw big changes in the earth, big changes in the sky, it was always associated with major political changes around the world as well.
[00:34:26.475 --> 00:34:36.397]  It was Shepard Ambulas of Intel Hub, like a week and a half ago, he had the exclusive that they thought the lava flowing towards
[00:34:38.002 --> 00:34:49.830]  The geothermal power station, one of the biggest in the world, might cause a giant explosion that could really, really damage things for miles around.
[00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.471]  Well, that's mainstream news now, as of yesterday.
[00:34:52.491 --> 00:35:01.137]  If you're a TV viewer, we're showing you satellite footage from our satellite uplinks directly from Kona, the big island.
[00:35:04.164 --> 00:35:09.607]  This is one of the biggest lava flows, again, ever recorded there on the island.
[00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:10.848]  It is spectacular.
[00:35:11.308 --> 00:35:21.174]  I was there in January of last year and flew over the main cone, but also over the big tubes going out of the ocean.
[00:35:22.155 --> 00:35:23.596]  And so it's always flowing.
[00:35:23.616 --> 00:35:28.078]  There's always areas that have lava flow, but this is over large parts of the island now.
[00:35:29.559 --> 00:35:30.920]  And I have made the decision
[00:35:32.435 --> 00:35:36.576]  To go look at it for myself and do some live coverage from there and the nuke base.
[00:35:36.616 --> 00:35:41.238]  So soon look for us in a helicopter over there.
[00:35:42.018 --> 00:35:44.339]  I'm getting you actual live feeds of it ourselves.
[00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:45.859]  This is important.
[00:35:45.879 --> 00:35:46.519]  This is historic.
[00:35:46.539 --> 00:35:47.299]  This is tectonic.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:54.702]  You know, I'm not procrastinating in what I'm doing saying next segment, next segment, next segment.
[00:35:54.742 --> 00:35:55.382]  I'll break down.
[00:35:58.146 --> 00:36:08.094]  Why Trump was able to get in office, what has happened in the internal civil war in the government, why the patriots in our government decided to risk their lives to take on the really criminal elements of the deep state.
[00:36:08.314 --> 00:36:09.675]  This is really a deep state civil war.
[00:36:10.696 --> 00:36:20.204]  They talk to you like children and you know there's no deep state, there's no secret government, there's no new world order, ha ha ha, there's no black helicopters, ha ha ha, there's no secret weapons, ha ha ha, there's no nothing.
[00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:26.674]  And then, you're not part of that debate, you're just watching football, and hey, what's going on?
[00:36:26.714 --> 00:36:33.357]  You're kind of locked in this false reality with false technology, Trojan horse technology, kind of the crap they give us.
[00:36:33.857 --> 00:36:35.318]  Trump wants to change all that.
[00:36:35.358 --> 00:36:39.240]  He wants a total revolution, a renaissance, pro-human future.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.142]  Doesn't mean it's not going to be fraught with peril and dangers as we develop all these technologies.
[00:36:45.606 --> 00:36:51.188]  The globalists want to freeze technology for us, only use the advanced technology for themselves, and then deploy it against us.
[00:36:51.488 --> 00:36:54.669]  So let me hit that first, and then the next segment is longer.
[00:36:55.209 --> 00:36:58.130]  I'll get into the big history lesson on that when we come back.
[00:37:03.132 --> 00:37:10.434]  Now, let me just give you a little forte.
[00:37:12.671 --> 00:37:16.355]  We're just a little hors d'oeuvre on where this is going and why I'm waiting for the next segment.
[00:37:16.515 --> 00:37:19.279]  So I want to print a few more articles that I thought of just to show you that tie into this.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:29.931]  You don't think they just gave, depending on what numbers you look at, 18 to 21 million
[00:37:31.988 --> 00:37:32.588]  We're good to go.
[00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:58.991]  They're trying to destroy America.
[00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:06.377]  You got plenty of folks that want to be the spies and make money in the system and you know all the rest of it, but at least they're not out to destroy the country.
[00:38:06.397 --> 00:38:11.002]  They don't have raging hard-ons to rape the nation.
[00:38:11.802 --> 00:38:21.151]  The globalists do and the Chinese have hired over the decades working with Hollywood that hates America and hates Christianity to create this weird cultural mutation.
[00:38:23.505 --> 00:38:27.308]  Uh, that is, that is absolutely hell-bent.
[00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.371]  See, if you're watching on TV, that's a live satellite feed.
[00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:32.292]  The signal just broke out.
[00:38:33.513 --> 00:38:34.694]  Then it cuts to other satellite feeds.
[00:38:34.734 --> 00:38:37.056]  It's, oh, we got all these satellite feeds, and it's awesome, man.
[00:38:37.536 --> 00:38:39.838]  So we're trying to hire more people just to track all the stuff as it unfolds.
[00:38:39.858 --> 00:38:43.261]  If you're a radio listener, I'm describing, uh, the volcano behind me in Kona.
[00:38:44.962 --> 00:38:46.103]  But getting back to what I was saying.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:58.362]  It was the pure suicidalness of the globalists and their arrogance that finally made people in the government and corporations go, we better fight this.
[00:38:58.762 --> 00:39:06.544]  I mean, folks, they're gonna hand out condoms, including to children, at the Boy Scout Jamboree?
[00:39:07.264 --> 00:39:18.267]  I talked to a bunch of guys that were Boy Scouts in the office, one of them's an Eagle Scout, and they all said they basically got out of it because even by the time they were Eagle Scouts, or about to be Eagle Scouts, 20 years ago, 25 years ago,
[00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.211]  You were already a minority if you didn't want to go in a tent and have group sex with a bunch of guys.
[00:39:28.052 --> 00:39:32.173]  And then people are just taking their young men and just shoving them into the mouth of this.
[00:39:33.093 --> 00:39:45.716]  And if I was a heterosexual pusher, I wouldn't sit there and push that on kids.
[00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:46.376]  That's pedophilia.
[00:39:47.759 --> 00:39:56.162]  But you've got the liberal gay lobby is pushing this stuff on young people.
[00:39:57.262 --> 00:40:07.105]  And again, I'm not running around pushing heterosexuality on people.
[00:40:09.746 --> 00:40:12.607]  And then you have the sexualization of children.
[00:40:12.627 --> 00:40:14.907]  You have that as the goal of the UN and the Globalist.
[00:40:14.947 --> 00:40:16.788]  That's such a massive story as well.
[00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:34.083]  And there's just a point where you're going to have a big jamboree with a bunch of tens of thousands of young men and you're going to give them all condoms?
[00:40:34.103 --> 00:40:43.227]  And you're going to have little 10-year-olds, 11-year-olds that are just getting into the Boy Scouts out of the Cub Scouts and they're all going to be in the middle of this?
[00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:48.230]  That's why the Mormons have completely pulled out of it.
[00:40:57.085 --> 00:40:59.166]  And oh, by the way, they're going to allow alcohol.
[00:41:00.066 --> 00:41:09.950]  So now they're going to have a giant camp out that will last for a week, and they're going to have alcohol at it with a bunch of little kids and men.
[00:41:14.871 --> 00:41:16.572]  This is Sodom and Gomorrah, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:17.779 --> 00:41:22.383]  Boy Scouts to provide condoms at upcoming World Jamboree.
[00:41:22.683 --> 00:41:31.330]  And you wonder what the Pope's up to, and you're wondering what all this is going on, and you wonder why people finally are putting the brakes to this in the government, because it's so crazy.
[00:41:33.932 --> 00:41:42.820]  Yeah, UN sex education standards that we're under, Trump got us out of it last year, but under Obama, and going back to Clinton, we got signed on to UNESCO.
[00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.236]  Actually, George Bush Sr.
[00:41:45.276 --> 00:41:46.596]  signed it right when he left last month.
[00:41:47.317 --> 00:41:49.318]  And UNESCO then would set all our standards.
[00:41:49.358 --> 00:41:49.998]  We're out of that!
[00:41:50.939 --> 00:41:54.561]  The UN was even setting how many, quote, refugees would come into the United States.
[00:41:57.342 --> 00:41:59.424]  So all this ties in together.
[00:42:01.725 --> 00:42:12.151]  Separately, you've got CNN saying that, just like in Cuba, we may have to close our embassies in China, because people are getting fried with electromagnetic weapons.
[00:42:14.574 --> 00:42:15.495]  Acoustic weapons.
[00:42:19.577 --> 00:42:20.457]  Microwave weapons.
[00:42:24.059 --> 00:42:28.262]  ThinkProgress attacked me for this yesterday, and notice it's the news today.
[00:42:29.062 --> 00:42:30.343]  They said, Jones is crazy.
[00:42:30.363 --> 00:42:32.944]  He thinks these CIA documents are meant to make you itchy.
[00:42:33.344 --> 00:42:37.527]  No, the document says it can make you throw up, make you sick, make you itchy, make you have convulsions.
[00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.592]  And they don't deny it's a real CIA document.
[00:42:40.832 --> 00:42:41.973]  They just make fun of me.
[00:42:41.993 --> 00:42:48.358]  And then the next day, they're having to shut down embassy operations because they're getting hit with it in China.
[00:42:48.558 --> 00:42:48.978]  CNN.
[00:42:50.379 --> 00:42:51.800]  You guys are jokes, man.
[00:42:52.761 --> 00:42:54.242]  Just get with the program.
[00:42:54.362 --> 00:42:57.104]  Get out the way, all you weirdos.
[00:42:57.925 --> 00:42:59.486]  Stay away from our children while you're at it.
[00:43:00.027 --> 00:43:00.887]  Get your neck broken.
[00:43:02.929 --> 00:43:07.833]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available
[00:43:08.979 --> 00:43:17.185]  Books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:25.772]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[00:43:27.193 --> 00:43:29.715]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[00:43:30.516 --> 00:43:33.938]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[00:43:34.879 --> 00:43:37.001]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[00:43:38.737 --> 00:43:43.919]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:52.463]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[00:43:53.444 --> 00:43:54.444]  It's up to us personally.
[00:43:55.845 --> 00:44:02.688]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[00:44:03.188 --> 00:44:04.489]  I expected that to happen.
[00:44:05.669 --> 00:44:06.990]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:44:08.993 --> 00:44:19.918]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:22.159]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:34.485]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[00:44:35.066 --> 00:44:37.247]  And we've already come so far together
[00:44:38.274 --> 00:44:47.296]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[00:44:47.856 --> 00:44:53.277]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[00:44:54.397 --> 00:45:02.279]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[00:45:04.522 --> 00:45:12.790]  But if you look at the Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:14.752]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[00:45:15.753 --> 00:45:18.415]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.038]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[00:45:21.078 --> 00:45:25.982]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[00:45:27.063 --> 00:45:37.818]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[00:45:37.898 --> 00:45:41.863]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[00:45:43.268 --> 00:45:43.928]  Our game changing.
[00:45:44.348 --> 00:45:45.849]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[00:45:46.049 --> 00:45:47.209]  The other equation of probiotic.
[00:45:47.249 --> 00:45:50.810]  It's now stronger and a lower price in PolarStore.com.
[00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:52.230]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:56.671]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[00:45:57.211 --> 00:46:00.252]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[00:46:00.352 --> 00:46:01.572]  It just does incredible things.
[00:46:02.012 --> 00:46:03.473]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[00:46:03.493 --> 00:46:06.453]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[00:46:06.473 --> 00:46:09.014]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:46:09.554 --> 00:46:14.355]  That's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[00:46:14.975 --> 00:46:26.117]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[00:46:26.557 --> 00:46:33.458]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, the ionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[00:46:33.498 --> 00:46:34.799]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:36.079]  You can swallow it as well.
[00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:42.866]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:43.186 --> 00:46:44.548]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:46:44.588 --> 00:46:54.198]  So, thank you all for remembering Infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:46:54.499 --> 00:46:57.542]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:47:05.928 --> 00:47:08.791]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:09.051 --> 00:47:15.898]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:15.978 --> 00:47:20.422]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:31.596 --> 00:47:34.277]  The globalists want to rob young people of their innocence.
[00:47:34.877 --> 00:47:36.598]  They want to program them, they want to control them.
[00:47:36.878 --> 00:47:39.519]  They admit that's what the social networks are involved in.
[00:47:39.539 --> 00:47:41.120]  They're designed to make them depressed.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.781]  That's what evil does, is try to destroy innocence.
[00:47:44.841 --> 00:47:46.302]  It's the very essence of it.
[00:47:47.522 --> 00:47:48.583]  It's the archetype of it.
[00:47:50.069 --> 00:48:06.018]  In the fairy tales, in the Union psychology, in movies like Legend, they want the bad guys, the goblins, the gremlins, the devil, they want to kill the unicorn.
[00:48:07.018 --> 00:48:08.359]  They want to destroy the innocents.
[00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:11.121]  They want to poison the children.
[00:48:12.648 --> 00:48:13.889]  In the Golden Child.
[00:48:13.969 --> 00:48:20.012]  They want to feed him the blood of a child they've killed to corrupt him so they can then weaken him so they can kill him.
[00:48:20.473 --> 00:48:21.513]  So it's all archetypal.
[00:48:22.894 --> 00:48:23.474]  And have you heard?
[00:48:23.494 --> 00:48:25.575]  It was Boy Scouts of America.
[00:48:26.196 --> 00:48:27.717]  Now it's just Scouts of America.
[00:48:28.217 --> 00:48:30.798]  So... Boy Scouts of America.
[00:48:32.539 --> 00:48:33.300]  B.S.A.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.021]  Well now they're changing it to J.S.A.
[00:48:36.222 --> 00:48:38.443]  Junior Schwingers of America.
[00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:41.265]  And that's the point I was making earlier is
[00:48:42.554 --> 00:48:44.355]  They're gonna let him have alcohol now, reportedly.
[00:48:45.296 --> 00:48:52.600]  Already the Boy Scouts of America has been plagued, just like the Vatican, all the rest of it, with all sorts of pedophilia and underage sex.
[00:48:53.721 --> 00:48:55.482]  And now it's just descending.
[00:48:57.133 --> 00:48:57.613]  Into that.
[00:48:58.174 --> 00:49:15.808]  And I was making the point that whether it's heterosexual, homosexual, whatever it is, if it involves young people, it's pedophilia and it's illegal and it's dangerous and it's going to absolutely disintegrate and it's going to cause a huge problem for these poor young people that just want to be able to go out and, you know, be out in nature and learn skills for life and how to be men.
[00:49:17.049 --> 00:49:20.272]  But see, you can't have a Boy Scouts because it's a boy.
[00:49:20.372 --> 00:49:20.833]  It's bad.
[00:49:20.893 --> 00:49:21.973]  You can't say mother and father.
[00:49:22.034 --> 00:49:22.874]  Those are evil things.
[00:49:22.914 --> 00:49:25.176]  Those are bad things here in America.
[00:49:25.677 --> 00:49:25.857]  Okay.
[00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:39.565]  Let me now get into why this power structure got out of control and why it's being removed.
[00:49:39.585 --> 00:49:40.926]  Because it's so dangerous.
[00:49:42.468 --> 00:49:45.292]  From even a lot of the power players in the system.
[00:49:46.562 --> 00:49:48.963]  And the choice that America had come to and where we were.
[00:49:48.983 --> 00:49:50.204]  I'm going to cover that in a moment.
[00:49:50.464 --> 00:49:55.227]  First off, that special that we have said was going to end yesterday, it will end today.
[00:49:55.267 --> 00:49:58.669]  It's not been taken down yet because we haven't announced the new special, which I'm about to do.
[00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:01.110]  These are great products.
[00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:02.431]  Funding our operation is critical.
[00:50:02.471 --> 00:50:04.192]  Please shop with the good guys or we won't exist.
[00:50:04.592 --> 00:50:05.633]  Thank you for standing with us.
[00:50:05.653 --> 00:50:07.174]  I want to thank the listeners for their support.
[00:50:07.234 --> 00:50:07.614]  Thank you.
[00:50:07.974 --> 00:50:09.815]  You've changed the world through your support of InfoWars.
[00:50:12.156 --> 00:50:12.877]  It's so critical.
[00:50:13.891 --> 00:50:25.454]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the 50% off the toothpaste, fluoride-free, instantane, the mouthwash, the immune gargle, 50% off bodies, it all has to end today.
[00:50:28.074 --> 00:50:29.574]  Because a lot of these are close to selling out.
[00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:40.657]  But, the new special that we have, I'm extremely excited about, and quite frankly, with Ron Paul coming up, and with Michael Caputo, should have been plugging that since the start,
[00:50:41.701 --> 00:50:45.443]  He's the guy exposing more moles inside the Trump campaign in White House.
[00:50:45.983 --> 00:50:49.685]  Il Caputo's coming up here in about 10 minutes, so should have been saying that from the very start of the show.
[00:50:49.945 --> 00:50:51.085]  We have a very full plate here.
[00:50:54.687 --> 00:51:05.412]  I just almost don't even want to get into this because I can't do it justice on the launch of it, but there's different types of energy and nootropics out there and there are people that do it
[00:51:11.681 --> 00:51:18.764]  In a way that is destructive, there are ways to do it that is good for you, or not bad for you.
[00:51:19.084 --> 00:51:24.206]  So again, Michael Caputo targeted by the... I keep saying Neil Caputo.
[00:51:25.447 --> 00:51:26.467]  I'm teleprompter free in here.
[00:51:26.767 --> 00:51:30.869]  Michael Caputo has been on the show before in the Trump campaign, targeted by Mueller.
[00:51:32.708 --> 00:51:52.343]  moles inside the campaign and of course we've exposed other moles ourselves here so that is that is all coming up and then we've got Ron Paul joining us and some other guests today on this Wednesday transmission.
[00:51:53.384 --> 00:51:57.707]  Now let me tell you about the new product just briefly here.
[00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:20.106]  I put out the real red pill that has preglanone and that has the key vitamins and key minerals and some other compounds because the science, the research, the facts showed that this is all the precursors and all the building blocks that a lot of people are missing that you've absolutely got to have.
[00:52:20.126 --> 00:52:25.710]  In the case of preglanone, it is a precursor to all the hormones in your body and a building block.
[00:52:27.652 --> 00:52:28.893]  And it's seen as very, very safe.
[00:52:31.294 --> 00:52:33.795]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is $39.95.
[00:52:34.515 --> 00:52:41.338]  It is available at infowarestore.com.
[00:52:43.198 --> 00:52:51.782]  Well, we have the new addition to the Red Pill, and that is the Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:52:52.748 --> 00:52:58.073]  Because the Red Pill does not have any of the natural stimulants in it.
[00:52:58.774 --> 00:53:04.359]  It just has what your body needs to operate, the preglanone, the vitamins, the minerals, all fused into one.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:09.144]  Something that I haven't seen any other multi-total vitamin that has that.
[00:53:09.664 --> 00:53:10.705]  It really is the next level.
[00:53:11.306 --> 00:53:13.108]  Takes about a week for most people for it to kick in.
[00:53:14.369 --> 00:53:16.071]  Well, the real Red Pill Plus
[00:53:18.553 --> 00:53:29.989]  has the very high quality good forms of caffeine and other natural compounds that are obviously documented and proven to have stimulant effects.
[00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.195]  Yerba Mate leaf extract and
[00:53:35.515 --> 00:53:37.737]  Germana seed extract, that's critical.
[00:53:38.217 --> 00:53:40.658]  Coffee fruit and green tea extract.
[00:53:41.039 --> 00:53:44.901]  So all these have different burn rates in your metabolic system from the research we've done.
[00:53:45.201 --> 00:53:52.186]  And this is the best info there is on it currently now, to have low dosages, but of four different compounds.
[00:53:53.047 --> 00:53:58.070]  Infusion is a lot better, in my experience, than just dumping a bunch of caffeine on your brain.
[00:53:59.414 --> 00:54:04.700]  Because it's different types, different makeups, different breakdowns, it's metabolized differently, and hits different areas.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:11.768]  So, you put it together with preglanone, put it together with all those vitamins and minerals, all fused together, and it's amazing.
[00:54:15.981 --> 00:54:19.762]  It has a bunch of other compounds in it, and it is our flagship nootropic.
[00:54:19.782 --> 00:54:20.922]  This is not meant to compete with it.
[00:54:21.982 --> 00:54:26.163]  It is something that simply augments it and helps it.
[00:54:26.724 --> 00:54:29.344]  Because, again, we're doing the research here.
[00:54:29.804 --> 00:54:31.385]  This is going to be very, very popular.
[00:54:31.405 --> 00:54:32.845]  The Real Red Pill is very, very popular.
[00:54:32.865 --> 00:54:35.206]  It has hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews.
[00:54:35.626 --> 00:54:43.148]  I believe the Real Red Pill Plus, Real Red Pill Plus, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, is the next level.
[00:54:43.168 --> 00:54:44.088]  But if you don't want
[00:54:44.929 --> 00:54:46.870]  The Germana Seed Extract.
[00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:53.372]  If you don't want the Yerimante Leaf Extract, if you don't want the Coffee Fruit, and you don't want the Green Tea Extract, then don't get PLUS.
[00:54:55.773 --> 00:55:00.074]  I mean, we could have called it Real Red Pill Turbo or something, but it's just PLUS.
[00:55:01.695 --> 00:55:03.615]  Real Red Pill Volcanic.
[00:55:04.396 --> 00:55:06.796]  Real Red Pill, you know, Turbocharged.
[00:55:07.076 --> 00:55:08.177]  But it's just PLUS.
[00:55:08.937 --> 00:55:10.978]  And it's something else.
[00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:15.695]  So you'll get immediate results, you know, in 30 minutes to an hour.
[00:55:16.536 --> 00:55:20.479]  And then overall though, you're not just taking something that doesn't have all the other building blocks.
[00:55:20.739 --> 00:55:23.601]  So down the road, you get depleted and then this stuff doesn't work anymore.
[00:55:24.162 --> 00:55:26.343]  That's what's critical is all the building blocks together.
[00:55:27.284 --> 00:55:35.130]  Now I knew this on purpose and I kind of got to it in the last segment, but, but, but, and I'll get more into it with Ron Paul and more into it in the third hour.
[00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:38.993]  We got Michael Caputo coming up as well, but here's what happened.
[00:55:40.492 --> 00:55:48.396]  The Office of Personnel Management hack happened in the middle of Obama's term.
[00:55:48.796 --> 00:55:49.497]  He was there eight years.
[00:55:49.557 --> 00:55:50.477]  It happened four years in.
[00:55:51.438 --> 00:55:53.078]  And it was quote, totally preventable.
[00:55:53.198 --> 00:55:54.699]  Congress has found that.
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:01.583]  And the total number now of Office of Personnel Management is 22.1 million people.
[00:56:02.863 --> 00:56:04.604]  Federal authorities say that's the Washington Post.
[00:56:05.485 --> 00:56:06.345]  They've also got Reuters.
[00:56:07.225 --> 00:56:10.067]  And that was given to the Communist Chinese on purpose, the word is.
[00:56:11.761 --> 00:56:16.762]  And then you had all Benghazi going on, at the same time you had all this stuff happening.
[00:56:22.204 --> 00:56:38.528]  And then it just got worse and worse with Benghazi, and the sexualization of children, and the people in the NSA and CIA know that there's pedophile rings taking control of the country, just like they've done the Vatican, just like they're doing major universities, just like they're doing anything that has children associated with it.
[00:56:39.188 --> 00:56:48.791]  Satanism, they know about the spirit cooking, they know about all this stuff that's going on in this pedophile devil cult we're up against and it just got so bad people said we got to take these people on.
[00:56:49.132 --> 00:57:04.617]  Plus they thought they'd put a demon hag, Hillary, in and all her crimes and just rubbing America's nose in it and the fact that Hollywood had already been bought up by the Communist Chinese by then, this is five years ago, and people said we got to do something and they looked at coups against Obama.
[00:57:05.526 --> 00:57:12.193]  The Pentagon tried to find people ready to lead it, and they said, no, the best thing to do is run an information war against them.
[00:57:12.934 --> 00:57:19.641]  And the best thing to do is just everybody in the agencies and in corporations that weren't traitors got together really in secret societies.
[00:57:19.681 --> 00:57:21.983]  And I've talked to some of the top Hollywood producers that are patriots.
[00:57:22.003 --> 00:57:22.604]  You wouldn't even know it.
[00:57:23.124 --> 00:57:24.146]  And they were involved as well.
[00:57:24.586 --> 00:57:26.948]  And so you've seen this whole big push.
[00:57:27.569 --> 00:57:32.710]  And now it's coming through with Trump and you see the economy turning around and all these, all these good things unfolding.
[00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:36.251]  That's because this is a real second American revolution that's taken place.
[00:57:36.551 --> 00:57:43.972]  And now that we've rolled them up in this illegal spy network and they've been caught lying about it, this, this, this is what appears to be their death blow.
[00:57:44.372 --> 00:57:45.233]  We've turned the corner.
[00:57:45.613 --> 00:57:46.833]  We're now winning the fight.
[00:57:47.133 --> 00:57:48.153]  We have the initiative.
[00:57:48.193 --> 00:57:48.953]  We have the upper hand.
[00:57:48.993 --> 00:57:50.174]  We have to press the attack though.
[00:57:50.214 --> 00:57:51.494]  Press, press, press, press.
[00:57:52.245 --> 00:57:56.608]  I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:57.088 --> 00:58:02.232]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.
[00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:05.494]  Now the product is BODY's Whole Body Support.
[00:58:05.794 --> 00:58:11.057]  This is available right now at a massive 50% discount at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:11.097 --> 00:58:14.780]  It's the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.
[00:58:15.652 --> 00:58:23.418]  It's got the black pepper, which makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:58:24.039 --> 00:58:30.644]  Now, we're not even including a lot of the benefits that this product has been scientifically proven to have.
[00:58:30.884 --> 00:58:42.474]  People have been taking turmeric and noticed elevated moods, increased energy, and that's aside from all the other factors, all the other benefits that we're talking about in this promo.
[00:58:42.654 --> 00:58:44.035]  It's 50% off, and as I said,
[00:58:44.575 --> 00:58:46.216]  I was taking turmeric anyway.
[00:58:47.176 --> 00:58:48.157]  It's curcumin.
[00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:49.977]  It's the powder used in curry.
[00:58:50.357 --> 00:58:52.318]  You know, you wouldn't be able to take it naturally.
[00:58:52.338 --> 00:58:58.020]  It'd make you sneeze and cough, but we've got it in a 120-capsule bottle right here.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.921]  Just got this fresh shipped in today.
[00:58:59.941 --> 00:59:01.822]  There's an article in Spectator Health.
[00:59:02.502 --> 00:59:09.325]  The article reads, daily consumption of curcumin improves the memory and mood of people with mild age-related memory loss, according to a new study.
[00:59:10.279 --> 00:59:12.762]  By the University of California in Los Angeles.
[00:59:13.363 --> 00:59:19.490]  Found in turmeric, curcumin has previously been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in lab studies.
[00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:25.698]  It's also been suggested as a possible reason that senior citizens in India, where curcumin is a dietary staple,
[00:59:26.398 --> 00:59:28.780]  Again, because it's in all the cooking, in all the curries.
[00:59:29.261 --> 00:59:33.084]  I have a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's and better cognitive performance.
[00:59:33.424 --> 00:59:34.425]  I take it anyway.
[00:59:34.585 --> 00:59:36.227]  So I just got this fresh today.
[00:59:36.347 --> 00:59:38.389]  Literally, the seal's not even being opened on it.
[00:59:38.609 --> 00:59:38.889]  It's just $29.95.
[00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:42.352]  Again, big, big, chunky bottle.
[00:59:42.372 --> 00:59:43.894]  120 capsules in this bottle.
[00:59:44.494 --> 00:59:48.778]  It is BODYS, the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.
[00:59:48.798 --> 00:59:51.620]  Available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.181]  Get it today.
[00:59:54.662 --> 00:59:58.774]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.276 --> 01:00:00.600]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:15.671]  You found it.
[01:00:15.951 --> 01:00:18.634]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[01:00:19.014 --> 01:00:20.576]  It's the InfoWar.
[01:00:20.696 --> 01:00:22.458]  And now, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.620]  There's too much confusion.
[01:00:37.992 --> 01:00:47.534]  Well, InfoWars is the relief from the confusion, cutting through the fog with a powerful radar of history and analysis and sources and research.
[01:00:48.314 --> 01:00:50.774]  We are taking the globalist on at point-blank range.
[01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.235]  We are changing history.
[01:00:52.695 --> 01:00:54.315]  It's a great honor to be involved in this with you.
[01:00:54.415 --> 01:00:55.435]  I really want to thank you all.
[01:00:55.755 --> 01:01:04.077]  But the globalists, Twitter, Starbucks, all the big establishment firms, are pushing political correctness to crush free speech.
[01:01:05.342 --> 01:01:16.747]  And so everybody knows that when you have businesses that are open to the public, you have big problems with heroin junkies, criminals, homeless, you name it, going and staying in your bathroom.
[01:01:18.628 --> 01:01:20.488]  And then crapping all over the place, you name it.
[01:01:21.449 --> 01:01:24.790]  Vomiting all over the place, heroin heads, it's pretty nasty.
[01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:32.833]  So there are policies that if people don't buy anything and they say, I'm going to use your bathroom and I'm going to sit here, you call the police.
[01:01:33.614 --> 01:01:34.134]  No loitering.
[01:01:35.707 --> 01:01:37.288]  It's law across the country.
[01:01:37.548 --> 01:01:39.690]  But they turned that into a racial issue.
[01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.452]  So people go into Starbucks and they pull that stunt.
[01:01:43.913 --> 01:01:51.197]  Well, our own Travis Knight, one of our camera guys, he thought he would just go into a Starbucks yesterday here in Austin.
[01:01:51.778 --> 01:01:52.558]  First one he went to.
[01:01:52.578 --> 01:02:00.683]  And he thought that he would see if he could get a free Starbucks just by saying promo code racism.
[01:02:01.744 --> 01:02:04.566]  He said, you know, I hear you guys are giving away free coffee to prove that you're not racist.
[01:02:05.493 --> 01:02:14.720]  And the person had the virtue signal to a guy with red hair and as, you know, white as this piece of paper right here.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.024]  So, he goes in there and, well, I mean, just see it for yourself.
[01:02:20.624 --> 01:02:23.166]  This is the mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:23.866 --> 01:02:29.811]  This is the brainwashing of the young people in this country, millennials.
[01:02:31.195 --> 01:02:33.217]  That, hey, drop your drawers or you're racist.
[01:02:33.357 --> 01:02:35.759]  Or, hey, give me your money or you're racist.
[01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:44.607]  This is why the corporations are pushing it and why Starbucks is virtue signaling to do this to get other corporations to behave like this because this is the global takeover plan.
[01:02:45.087 --> 01:02:46.609]  Here is the shocking report.
[01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:47.669]  You should try it yourself.
[01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:48.830]  Go in and just, I'm gonna do it today.
[01:02:49.111 --> 01:02:50.372]  Hey, I'd like a free coffee.
[01:02:50.452 --> 01:02:51.953]  I heard you're giving reparations.
[01:02:52.374 --> 01:02:54.355]  And of course they say, absolutely, here's your free coffee.
[01:02:54.575 --> 01:02:54.876]  Here it is.
[01:02:55.928 --> 01:02:57.649]  Travis Knight for InfoWars.com.
[01:02:57.689 --> 01:03:03.593]  Now, as you may remember, back in April, we had two black men get arrested at a Starbucks after not ordering anything.
[01:03:03.733 --> 01:03:08.517]  And shortly thereafter, Hotep Jesus went in and demanded a free coffee as a form of reparations.
[01:03:08.937 --> 01:03:14.241]  Yeah, I heard you guys don't like black people, so I wanted to get my Starbucks reparations voucher.
[01:03:14.841 --> 01:03:20.285]  Now, today, in May, we're gonna see if Starbucks still holds to their policy of giving away a free coffee to anyone who says racism.
[01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:23.147]  Hey, uh, so,
[01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:28.560]  I saw online that to make up for the racism, Starbucks is giving away free coffee.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.721]  I would just like to get a cup if that's cool.
[01:03:31.301 --> 01:03:31.641]  Okay.
[01:03:46.887 --> 01:03:48.368]  Free coffee at Starbucks, folks!
[01:03:48.388 --> 01:03:49.568]  It's like a Jedi mind trick.
[01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:51.249]  Uh, yes please.
[01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.929]  Thank you.
[01:03:52.149 --> 01:03:53.530]  Would you like room for cream?
[01:03:58.809 --> 01:04:00.050]  The magic word, racism.
[01:04:03.914 --> 01:04:04.855]  So there you go, folks.
[01:04:04.995 --> 01:04:08.138]  It's incredible to see that Starbucks has officially changed their ways.
[01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:09.239]  Excuse me.
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.701]  Can I just have everyone's attention real quick?
[01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:16.886]  I just want to say thanks to Starbucks for making reparations with this coffee.
[01:04:17.907 --> 01:04:19.208]  This Starbucks is cleansed of racism.
[01:04:19.869 --> 01:04:20.209]  Thank you.
[01:04:20.869 --> 01:04:21.250]  That's right.
[01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:22.311]  He bought his indulgence.
[01:04:30.498 --> 01:04:31.182]  There we go, folks.
[01:04:32.428 --> 01:04:33.414]  One Starbucks cleanse.
[01:04:34.992 --> 01:04:35.753]  How many more to go?
[01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:40.536]  To get your free Starbucks coffee, go to your local Starbucks and use the promo code RACISM.
[01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:42.938]  Promo code RACIST may also work at some locations.
[01:04:43.018 --> 01:04:46.801]  Try the promo codes RACIST or RACISM at your local Starbucks today!
[01:04:46.941 --> 01:04:50.123]  This public service announcement brought to you by InfoWars.com.
[01:04:51.064 --> 01:04:51.724]  That's right, folks.
[01:04:51.764 --> 01:04:52.805]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:04:52.885 --> 01:04:55.707]  Just go in and say, hey, reparations, give me my free coffee.
[01:04:56.127 --> 01:04:57.168]  And then it's like magic.
[01:04:57.208 --> 01:04:58.269]  It's like mind control.
[01:04:58.669 --> 01:05:00.490]  I think I'm going to try to move into one of their bathrooms next.
[01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.951]  I'm serious.
[01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:07.110]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:08.871]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:05:09.392 --> 01:05:20.819]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:30.503]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:05:30.943 --> 01:05:41.628]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:05:42.148 --> 01:05:44.470]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.151]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:05:46.552 --> 01:05:56.159]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:05:56.259 --> 01:05:58.401]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:05:58.962 --> 01:06:03.846]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:06:07.609 --> 01:06:11.572]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:14.168 --> 01:06:18.292]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:25.699 --> 01:06:33.927]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.602]  Michael, so you see a pattern here?
[01:06:43.022 --> 01:06:55.694]  Former Obama administration officials justifying, spying on, surveilling, whatever you want to call it, putting a mole in, on an opposing campaign, and a hotly contested election year.
[01:06:56.411 --> 01:06:57.391]  Final thoughts.
[01:06:57.451 --> 01:07:00.313]  I'll tell you, you've spent time in Russia.
[01:07:00.353 --> 01:07:01.513]  Carter and I both have.
[01:07:01.873 --> 01:07:10.417]  In Russia they call this the Soloviki, the national security leadership that secretly spies on the entire citizenry of Russia.
[01:07:10.457 --> 01:07:15.719]  And here we are in the United States with our own Soloviki underneath President Obama.
[01:07:15.739 --> 01:07:17.620]  Let me tell you something that I know for a fact.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:28.082]  This informant, this person that they planned and tried to plan into the campaign and even into the administration, if you believe Axios, he's not the only person that came at the campaign.
[01:07:28.343 --> 01:07:32.043]  And the FBI is not the only Obama agency that came at the campaign.
[01:07:32.424 --> 01:07:33.744]  I know because they came at me.
[01:07:34.104 --> 01:07:37.765]  And I'm looking for clearance from my attorney to reveal this to the public.
[01:07:38.065 --> 01:07:39.245]  This is just the beginning.
[01:07:39.745 --> 01:07:46.087]  And I'll tell you, when we finally find out the truth about this, Director Clapper and the rest of them,
[01:07:46.607 --> 01:07:46.827]  I think?
[01:08:07.742 --> 01:08:10.705]  And we know about Fiona Hill being a Soros mole.
[01:08:11.386 --> 01:08:22.396]  We know about from people at meetings that Roger Stone first broke here that came out six months later in the New York Post when he was admitting that he worked for Soros and hated Trump and Trump was an idiot and all this garbage.
[01:08:22.936 --> 01:08:23.997]  I mean, it is amazing.
[01:08:24.037 --> 01:08:27.481]  But going back to the campaign, this is trying to destroy our republic.
[01:08:27.841 --> 01:08:30.484]  Now we've got Clapper going on with
[01:08:31.496 --> 01:08:39.841]  I mean, it's just amazing that this is happening on The View with Joy Behar, going, yeah, we spied on them, though I don't like to use that word, you know, it's for their own good.
[01:08:39.961 --> 01:08:45.925]  And then she says, we'll play the clip coming up after we talk to Michael Caputo, she says, well, they ought to thank you for this.
[01:08:46.005 --> 01:08:48.526]  So Clapper and all of them have lied.
[01:08:48.546 --> 01:08:49.827]  They have done all this.
[01:08:49.867 --> 01:08:52.989]  They've been caught lying to Congress, not the first time for Clapper.
[01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:55.590]  He said the NSA spies on no one in America.
[01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.731]  Michael Caputo, again.
[01:08:58.712 --> 01:09:08.926]  He is a well-known political operative for the Republican Party, and he also is a journalist, and of course he's worked for Jack Kemp and George H.W.
[01:09:08.966 --> 01:09:13.071]  Bush and many, many others, and he is an American patriot.
[01:09:13.872 --> 01:09:14.232]  I don't know.
[01:09:35.769 --> 01:09:36.290]  I'll tell you.
[01:10:04.756 --> 01:10:06.137]  It's accurate.
[01:10:06.217 --> 01:10:07.679]  Short answer, absolutely.
[01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:12.342]  And I'll tell you, the more we hear about this, the more it makes sense.
[01:10:12.883 --> 01:10:18.447]  You know, I've been speaking out the last two days about a former U.S.
[01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:26.214]  government contractor who approached me through an intermediary, offering me what he said were Clinton-related emails.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:34.644]  Now, he said that they were in the possession of the National Security Agency, the boys at Annapolis Junction, he called them.
[01:10:35.085 --> 01:10:39.887]  But interesting, Alex, this was the first week of May in 2016.
[01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:55.656]  That's why it was so confusing to me when it happened, and why I gave the details about this to the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and to the Mueller team, hoping they would look into it, because it just didn't make sense to me.
[01:10:56.317 --> 01:10:58.446]  But then none of them showed any interest in it.
[01:10:58.848 --> 01:11:01.679]  The Mueller people didn't even take notes when I told them about it.
[01:11:02.364 --> 01:11:03.805]  And I couldn't understand that.
[01:11:04.425 --> 01:11:05.745]  It's always been confusing.
[01:11:05.785 --> 01:11:07.746]  For two years now, very confusing.
[01:11:08.126 --> 01:11:13.929]  I'm on the second anniversary of talking with this gentleman who I never met through an intermediary.
[01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:14.849]  Two years now.
[01:11:15.349 --> 01:11:31.976]  And then I hear about this Halper guy, this Stephen Halper guy, the former CIA operative working for the Department of Defense, who was trying to work with members of the Trump Policy Committee, Papadopoulos, Carter Page,
[01:11:32.574 --> 01:11:33.135]  I think so.
[01:11:56.018 --> 01:11:59.502]  I thought immediately about two years ago when a U.S.
[01:11:59.563 --> 01:12:03.208]  government contractor, or at least a former U.S.
[01:12:03.248 --> 01:12:10.178]  government contractor, reached out to me through someone I know very well to try to give me what he called Clinton emails.
[01:12:12.267 --> 01:12:14.168]  Wow, Michael Caputo is our guest.
[01:12:14.428 --> 01:12:20.710]  I've got a selfish question here because I heard this from seven different people of eight that were questioned.
[01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:24.812]  One of them now is, I guess, too scared to even talk to Roger or anybody.
[01:12:24.832 --> 01:12:40.218]  I'm not gonna give any names here, but you are the only one of the eight that is willing to come on air, despite what your lawyers are saying, and get into yours truly and what the FBI said to you about Infowars, about the type of questions they were asking.
[01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:43.384]  You know, I have to be careful about this.
[01:12:43.864 --> 01:12:45.284]  I was really afraid, actually.
[01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:50.366]  They told me, Mr. Caputo, we watch you on television and, you know, kind of unwritten, you know, unsaid.
[01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.007]  Be careful what you say.
[01:12:52.807 --> 01:12:55.308]  You know, I felt threatened, even though they didn't threaten me.
[01:12:55.468 --> 01:12:56.568]  So I've been really careful.
[01:12:56.608 --> 01:12:59.849]  But, you know, I was mostly concerned about the legal cost.
[01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:04.411]  I mean, because I have a very strong, very powerful lawyer who's helping me get through this.
[01:13:04.751 --> 01:13:07.052]  But every visit with these guys costs $35,000, $40,000 if you have the right lawyer.
[01:13:10.613 --> 01:13:11.053]  I think so.
[01:13:26.242 --> 01:13:35.649]  I know that the MAGA crowd, the people who support the President, that if I get called back in again, they will support me at CaputoLegalFund.com.
[01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:43.494]  And Alex, because I feel like they got my back, I can tell you unequivocally that they're asking about you and InfoWars.
[01:13:44.215 --> 01:13:48.998]  I've heard that from people who have been in with the Mueller team, and I got it from them myself.
[01:13:51.243 --> 01:13:56.944]  Can you specifically, I mean, Roger relayed some of it to me, but can you specifically tell the viewers and listeners what they were asking?
[01:13:58.545 --> 01:14:02.306]  Well, you know, they asked me if I knew you, that if I met you and if I was working with you.
[01:14:02.386 --> 01:14:10.368]  I told them that I knew you and that I had met you, that I had interviewed on InfoWars a couple of times, but that I wasn't working with InfoWars on projects and stuff.
[01:14:10.808 --> 01:14:15.909]  And they looked at me, so they seemed to be satisfied with that as my answer, and they didn't ask me any follow-up.
[01:14:16.573 --> 01:14:30.645]  But the fact that you came up in their line of questioning, and the fact that I had heard that from other people who had been in with them, tells me that you're certainly a topic of conversation in that nondescript government building.
[01:14:31.285 --> 01:14:31.926]  That's for sure.
[01:14:32.588 --> 01:14:48.080]  Well, I know for a fact I don't have any connections to the Russian government, but I've had stuff happen where people walk up when I'm with Navy SEALs that are in plain clothes that no one even knows, one of them, you know, senior commander level, and we let her track it back to the feds and say, hey,
[01:14:49.028 --> 01:14:54.392]  Will you meet with somebody from Taiwan who wants to buy, you know, some submarine parts?
[01:14:55.233 --> 01:14:59.656]  And they don't even know that these are specifically Navy SEALs from secret submarine detachments.
[01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:03.679]  So they've got these spies popping in, trying to get us to say something.
[01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:07.441]  And from what I've seen with Halprin and these other moles, that that's basically what happens.
[01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.543]  They just show up and go, hey, you talk to Russians?
[01:15:09.563 --> 01:15:10.464]  Want to talk to some Russians?
[01:15:10.664 --> 01:15:11.524]  Know anything about Russians?
[01:15:11.805 --> 01:15:15.507]  And then that's their proof of Russians is the fact that they're in there bringing up Russians.
[01:15:15.527 --> 01:15:16.128]  Is that accurate?
[01:15:17.108 --> 01:15:17.909]  That is accurate.
[01:15:17.969 --> 01:15:32.627]  In fact, you know, the approach I talked about from this former national security government consultant, I felt like I could talk about it because the Mueller team and the Senate and House Intelligence Committees
[01:15:33.067 --> 01:15:34.147]  Exactly, they're not running a real investigation.
[01:15:34.187 --> 01:15:37.068]  One more segment with Michael Caputo and when we come back he's going to drop more bombshells.
[01:15:37.088 --> 01:15:41.069]  Stay with us and keep praying for him and keep financially supporting him because they're coming back again.
[01:16:03.299 --> 01:16:09.945]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[01:16:10.626 --> 01:16:12.407]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[01:16:13.008 --> 01:16:18.873]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[01:16:19.273 --> 01:16:21.916]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[01:16:22.176 --> 01:16:25.218]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[01:16:25.578 --> 01:16:31.481]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[01:16:32.141 --> 01:16:38.605]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:44.867]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[01:16:45.347 --> 01:16:48.948]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[01:16:49.448 --> 01:16:57.651]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[01:16:58.031 --> 01:17:04.273]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:05.342 --> 01:17:09.746]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news.
[01:17:10.386 --> 01:17:18.493]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[01:17:19.053 --> 01:17:20.715]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[01:17:21.255 --> 01:17:28.201]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this, because it is pure atomic iodine.
[01:17:28.241 --> 01:17:33.686]  Everything else out there is bound, or it's contaminated, it's not absorbable, it's toxic.
[01:17:34.366 --> 01:17:46.478]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's injected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[01:17:46.598 --> 01:17:49.120]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[01:17:49.861 --> 01:17:57.328]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[01:17:57.348 --> 01:17:58.249]  They used to make drugs.
[01:17:58.429 --> 01:18:02.413]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[01:18:02.813 --> 01:18:07.478]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[01:18:08.098 --> 01:18:11.661]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:15.844]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[01:18:16.404 --> 01:18:19.166]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[01:18:19.186 --> 01:18:20.327]  We have a good supply right now.
[01:18:20.747 --> 01:18:22.108]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[01:18:22.529 --> 01:18:24.830]  But this may be the clincher.
[01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:28.073]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[01:18:28.513 --> 01:18:31.917]  But, we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[01:18:32.378 --> 01:18:34.500]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[01:18:34.821 --> 01:18:36.202]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[01:18:36.563 --> 01:18:43.932]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:47.817]  Survival Shield X2 at m4warsstore.com and m4warslife.com.
[01:18:48.237 --> 01:18:50.998]  You've got to experience what having the good halogen in your body does.
[01:18:51.458 --> 01:18:54.199]  Most folks in about three weeks go through a detoxification process.
[01:18:54.899 --> 01:18:59.401]  But what it does is for stamina, libido, focus, energy, it's really amazing.
[01:18:59.561 --> 01:19:06.563]  And if you don't have true iodine, pure iodine, you will end up having all sorts of disorders, just like water, just like oxygen.
[01:19:06.883 --> 01:19:09.004]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[01:19:09.364 --> 01:19:10.604]  It's available exclusively.
[01:19:10.884 --> 01:19:14.685]  Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:14.725 --> 01:19:16.166]  And I hope, like a few years ago,
[01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.430]  That's
[01:19:36.594 --> 01:19:39.395]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[01:19:39.715 --> 01:19:48.036]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[01:19:48.597 --> 01:19:52.917]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[01:19:53.338 --> 01:19:59.899]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:20:06.366 --> 01:20:10.928]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.591 --> 01:20:28.355]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:20:29.035 --> 01:20:30.556]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.236 --> 01:20:40.060]  Well, Michael Caputo is the only person out of eight people grabbed off the street last week, not the first time it's happened to him, and interrogated and threatened and all the rest of it.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.221]  He's the one out of eight that's willing to come on.
[01:20:43.241 --> 01:20:46.803]  Oh my gosh, you know they're listening to his phones, they're listening to mine, that's come out in the news.
[01:20:47.803 --> 01:20:50.745]  He just told me a bunch of incredible stuff I hope he'll say on air.
[01:20:51.045 --> 01:20:52.386]  But he's promised to come back soon.
[01:20:52.786 --> 01:20:55.227]  He even said that he knew what coming on this show would mean.
[01:20:55.247 --> 01:20:57.208]  I just love red-blooded Americans.
[01:20:57.228 --> 01:20:58.489]  So, Michael, we got eight minutes left.
[01:20:58.809 --> 01:20:59.549]  You've got the floor.
[01:20:59.629 --> 01:21:02.311]  Take over and tell folks as much as you can about what's happening.
[01:21:03.331 --> 01:21:08.094]  I believe, though, we're turning the tide against the deep state right now and the fact that they've been caught in all this illegal activity.
[01:21:08.474 --> 01:21:10.675]  I believe, thanks to your courage and others, that we're going to win.
[01:21:12.046 --> 01:21:12.506]  I do too.
[01:21:12.566 --> 01:21:13.907]  I think the worm has turned.
[01:21:14.047 --> 01:21:17.529]  I think you know it because you see how desperate they are.
[01:21:17.789 --> 01:21:21.931]  You don't have to look any further than what they're doing to the people who surround Roger Stone.
[01:21:22.391 --> 01:21:23.832]  They're rounding him up like cattle.
[01:21:24.272 --> 01:21:28.294]  Even people who haven't worked for him or even much talked to him in the last three years.
[01:21:28.554 --> 01:21:34.237]  There's one character that used to work for Roger some years ago who despises Donald Trump.
[01:21:34.618 --> 01:21:37.219]  Wouldn't cross the road to put him out if he was on fire.
[01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:41.201]  And they went and talked to him as well, staking out his mom's house.
[01:21:41.821 --> 01:21:49.884]  I mean, the surveillance that's going on outside the homes of people who work for or know Roger Stone is abominable.
[01:21:49.964 --> 01:21:51.564]  I know that's what the FBI does.
[01:21:51.744 --> 01:21:53.765]  I know that that's what law enforcement does.
[01:21:54.325 --> 01:21:57.946]  But the way they're doing it and the people they're doing it to is unseemly.
[01:21:58.486 --> 01:21:59.126]  Unseemly.
[01:21:59.367 --> 01:22:00.767]  And the fact of the matter is this.
[01:22:01.471 --> 01:22:06.372]  We're at a very strange and dangerous inflection point in this investigation.
[01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:09.673]  They've got zero proof of Russian collusion.
[01:22:10.053 --> 01:22:11.973]  They're getting people on process crimes.
[01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.474]  You lied to me about your bag of potato chips.
[01:22:14.874 --> 01:22:17.815]  I'm an FBI agent, so now we got you.
[01:22:18.155 --> 01:22:30.818]  They're doing that, but now they've realized, and the public is coming to understand, that they've got zero Russian collusion evidence, and they certainly have zero evidence on the president to show that he colluded with Russia.
[01:22:31.278 --> 01:22:36.001]  So they're reaching a point where this investigation looks more bogus than ever.
[01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:50.428]  And if you know anything about this guy Weissman, who's one of the lead investigators over there, it's when his case looks like it's junk, like he's got a pig in a poke, that's when he overcharges.
[01:22:50.888 --> 01:22:52.669]  That's when he overreaches.
[01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:56.131]  That's when he hides exculpatory evidence.
[01:22:56.681 --> 01:23:06.044]  And right now, unfortunately, at this point in the investigation, as far as I can see, and of course, Alex, you know, I don't have a full perspective of what they're talking about.
[01:23:06.364 --> 01:23:09.745]  I'm looking at this investigation through a straw, not a pipe.
[01:23:10.105 --> 01:23:20.488]  But from my perspective, at this point in the investigation, when they know they got a pig and a poke, when they're going to be stretching further than they should, they're looking at Roger Stone.
[01:23:21.048 --> 01:23:30.340]  And I think they're going to manufacture some kind of bogus and non-existent crime just to drag him in because they've got nothing on anybody else.
[01:23:30.761 --> 01:23:32.583]  And as you know, Roger is one of your guys.
[01:23:32.984 --> 01:23:34.866]  Roger is a very big fish.
[01:23:35.367 --> 01:23:38.891]  And they need a big fish to have the fish fry that they're hoping to have.
[01:23:39.572 --> 01:23:40.112]  We're good to go.
[01:24:00.999 --> 01:24:09.769]  He's now telling the media off the air that it was a misunderstanding, you know, he never had anything to do with the NSA, etc., etc.
[01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:15.015]  I want him sat down in front of the DOJ to explain what he did.
[01:24:15.115 --> 01:24:16.336]  I'm certainly willing to do it.
[01:24:16.596 --> 01:24:22.163]  The president called for an expanded investigation into what the FBI and the other
[01:24:23.223 --> 01:24:27.185]  We're doing with his campaign.
[01:24:27.566 --> 01:24:32.608]  And if they're doing that, then they need to talk to this former government contractor and find out what he's up to.
[01:24:32.648 --> 01:24:37.251]  But another thing, Alex, that was not the only approach to me during the campaign.
[01:24:37.511 --> 01:24:46.295]  There's another one that I am absolutely banned from talking about by my attorney because it was something of concern to the Mueller investigation.
[01:24:46.776 --> 01:24:49.097]  I want that approach investigated too.
[01:24:49.817 --> 01:24:54.060]  I want the expanded DOJ investigation to call me.
[01:24:54.501 --> 01:24:55.381]  Please call me.
[01:24:55.982 --> 01:24:58.083]  I don't care that it's going to cost me more legal fees.
[01:24:58.383 --> 01:25:04.608]  I don't care that my lawyer and I are going to have to fly into Washington from Buffalo and incur all those costs.
[01:25:04.908 --> 01:25:19.258]  Because I know that the people who know that they back the president and want to make America great again are ready to back me and people like Roger Stone because they're trying to intimidate us with the cost of this investigation.
[01:25:19.298 --> 01:25:20.779]  Well, that's what you said during the break.
[01:25:20.879 --> 01:25:24.042]  I mean, you said it wasn't off record, but I mean, say it in your own words.
[01:25:24.062 --> 01:25:26.323]  You said, I know what coming on your show means.
[01:25:26.403 --> 01:25:29.045]  And I guess you're kind of signing your John Hancock pretty big here.
[01:25:29.946 --> 01:25:34.149]  Well, you know, Roger called me up and he said, look, we want you to come on with Alex.
[01:25:34.169 --> 01:25:35.871]  And I said, it's going to cost me some money.
[01:25:36.351 --> 01:25:43.416]  And Roger reminded me that people are going to CaputoLegalFund.com and donating so that I'm able to speak.
[01:25:43.917 --> 01:25:46.919]  And so I just know for a fact, Alex,
[01:25:47.459 --> 01:25:47.599]  Well...
[01:26:11.664 --> 01:26:12.084]  I understand.
[01:26:12.104 --> 01:26:19.407]  I appreciate your courage to go on Fox, to come on here as well, and to talk about what's happening inside and expose the moles.
[01:26:19.427 --> 01:26:24.228]  Because you going public has really helped the president now and is really giving him a lot more steam.
[01:26:24.949 --> 01:26:26.929]  And so, again, it's true.
[01:26:26.989 --> 01:26:28.710]  I mean, you really manned up here, Michael.
[01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.110]  And so has Roger.
[01:26:30.871 --> 01:26:34.412]  But, you know, they're closing the noose in on him, looking for some process issue.
[01:26:35.172 --> 01:26:39.993]  Roger, as you know, uses an outside account and so do I. We all have extremely clean backgrounds.
[01:26:40.333 --> 01:26:41.554]  Because doing this, you better.
[01:26:41.574 --> 01:26:43.914]  I mean, you better be as clean as a whistle.
[01:26:44.895 --> 01:26:51.276]  And still, despite that, I know for a fact that they have the FBI follow me around.
[01:26:51.396 --> 01:26:55.197]  Our securities videotaped their trucks out here and their vehicles.
[01:26:55.217 --> 01:26:58.258]  We just showed the footage Pasovic got of them harassing people.
[01:26:59.239 --> 01:27:00.479]  Tell folks about this truck footage.
[01:27:01.684 --> 01:27:16.453]  Oh yeah, I mean, two years ago if somebody told me that there was going to be a surveillance truck with high technology hanging from its bumper sitting outside my friend's mentally disabled brother's house, I'd have said they're nuts.
[01:27:17.071 --> 01:27:19.692]  But my friend was there who actually works for Roger.
[01:27:19.752 --> 01:27:20.772]  He's one of his writers.
[01:27:21.312 --> 01:27:23.032]  Helps him with his content management.
[01:27:23.692 --> 01:27:25.333]  And he was visiting his brother.
[01:27:27.933 --> 01:27:31.594]  Wandering around outside of his house was this white pickup truck.
[01:27:32.014 --> 01:27:36.175]  On the front bumper was an empty cell phone catcher.
[01:27:36.975 --> 01:27:41.116]  It's called a Kingfish brand, which is a standard brand of the FBI.
[01:27:41.516 --> 01:27:44.117]  And if you look at that... So it's a stingray type unit?
[01:27:45.031 --> 01:27:47.613]  Yeah, and Stingray brand name called Kingfish.
[01:27:47.953 --> 01:27:49.554]  It's the brand that the FBI buys.
[01:27:49.795 --> 01:27:59.822]  And on the back of that white pickup is a very unique cap, a surveillance cap, that allows people to sit inside and monitor equipment.
[01:28:00.382 --> 01:28:03.705]  If you look at this video that Jack Masovia found, it's
[01:28:04.285 --> 01:28:13.508]  It stops in front of my friend's mentally incapacitated, mentally handicapped brother's house and sits there and tries to listen to their cell phone.
[01:28:13.848 --> 01:28:18.349]  And in fact was following my friend's mentally handicapped brother.
[01:28:18.369 --> 01:28:19.449]  To harass him, obviously.
[01:28:19.829 --> 01:28:20.650]  That's classic COINTELPRO.
[01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:21.950]  Back and forth to the dog park.
[01:28:22.509 --> 01:28:23.610]  Classic COINTELPRO.
[01:28:23.671 --> 01:28:26.254]  Ron Paul's coming up, former congressman, to get into all this.
[01:28:26.694 --> 01:28:32.141]  I know you've got to go, but since you've already taken the plunge in here, please come back soon with new developments.
[01:28:32.161 --> 01:28:36.086]  But the 30 seconds we have, you're saying what I have with my sources is accurate.
[01:28:36.307 --> 01:28:40.372]  This was a major spy network against the president, and a whole bunch more about to come out.
[01:28:41.463 --> 01:28:51.807]  I believe so, and if I've got two, and you know, one of them may be a major coincidence or a complete misunderstanding, but it also might be the key to the kingdom of God, you know?
[01:28:52.067 --> 01:28:54.227]  And we need to know every single one of these things.
[01:28:54.507 --> 01:29:00.910]  If I've got two, there are, you know, 75 people working for the president during his campaign, and you know...
[01:29:02.230 --> 01:29:03.611]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:05.193]  You can't survive without it.
[01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:06.274]  But where do you get it?
[01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:12.339]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:29:12.559 --> 01:29:18.284]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:29:18.464 --> 01:29:35.332]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:29:35.732 --> 01:29:37.854]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:29:38.214 --> 01:29:39.415]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:30:01.533 --> 01:30:05.076]  I have a special message for you from the President of the United States.
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:28.447]  The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC.
[01:30:33.089 --> 01:30:40.212]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of nonviolence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:30:48.462 --> 01:30:53.085]  The USS Liberty was attacked by three Mirage III fighter bombers.
[01:30:53.105 --> 01:30:56.368]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former U.S.
[01:30:56.408 --> 01:30:58.309]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:30:58.729 --> 01:31:02.132]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:31:02.412 --> 01:31:04.633]  They now said that there were 11 hostages.
[01:31:05.214 --> 01:31:09.537]  Two were killed in their rooms this morning, yesterday morning.
[01:31:10.558 --> 01:31:14.121]  Nine were killed at the airport tonight.
[01:31:14.141 --> 01:31:15.262]  They're all gone.
[01:31:16.022 --> 01:31:22.247]  A bomb exploded early this morning in the Pentagon, and left-wing terrorists telephoned newspapers to say they were responsible.
[01:31:22.307 --> 01:31:29.813]  People calling themselves members of the Weather Underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California.
[01:31:29.873 --> 01:31:31.795]  Here he goes, and he will go.
[01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:33.576]  He's down, and he is hurt.
[01:31:33.656 --> 01:31:34.657]  Oh, my God.
[01:31:39.549 --> 01:31:41.082]  Evil's riding the Amazing Stunt Cycle!
[01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:45.391]  Are you sure it's the measles?
[01:31:45.411 --> 01:31:49.652]  Well, he's certainly got all the symptoms.
[01:31:49.852 --> 01:31:54.633]  A slight temperature, a lot of dots, and a great big smile.
[01:31:54.813 --> 01:31:55.893]  A great big smile.
[01:31:56.233 --> 01:31:57.353]  No school for a few days.
[01:31:57.534 --> 01:31:59.314]  Boy, this is the life, isn't it?
[01:31:59.334 --> 01:31:59.614]  Yeah.
[01:31:59.634 --> 01:32:02.695]  If you have to get sick, you sure can't beat the measles.
[01:32:02.715 --> 01:32:03.575]  That's right.
[01:32:03.595 --> 01:32:04.555]  Swine flu?
[01:32:04.735 --> 01:32:06.496]  Man, I'm too fast to let it catch me.
[01:32:07.036 --> 01:32:08.156]  You'll want to be protected.
[01:32:08.816 --> 01:32:09.937]  Get a shot of protection.
[01:32:10.517 --> 01:32:11.477]  The Swine Flu Shot.
[01:32:12.137 --> 01:32:16.500]  The vaccines are safe, easy to take, and they can protect you against flu.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:23.365]  Washington decided that every man, woman, and child in the nation should get a shot to prevent a nationwide outbreak, a pandemic.
[01:32:23.465 --> 01:32:33.772]  This virus was the cause of a pandemic in 1918 and 1919 that resulted in over half a million deaths in the United States.
[01:32:33.792 --> 01:32:35.694]  46 million of us obediently took the shot.
[01:32:36.574 --> 01:32:45.063]  And now 4,000 Americans are claiming damages from Uncle Sam amounting to three and a half billion dollars because of what happened when they took that shot.
[01:32:45.504 --> 01:32:50.889]  By far the greatest number of the claims, two-thirds of them, are for neurological damage or even death.
[01:32:54.473 --> 01:32:58.858]  If you are resuming this transition, you are in the resistance.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:09.082]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.836 --> 01:33:29.580]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.791 --> 01:33:42.515]  All right, Dr. Ron Paul is going to be popping in on this in a minute to talk about Russiagate and Spygate and North Korea and Trump and Syria and where he sees all this going here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:42.535 --> 01:33:47.717]  But I wanted to finish up with Michael Caputo, who's the only person in the whole Russiagate thing that's willing to talk to the media.
[01:33:48.097 --> 01:33:50.979]  And boy, he's been exposing government moles inside the campaign.
[01:33:51.579 --> 01:33:53.399]  This whole Spygate thing is exploding.
[01:33:53.459 --> 01:33:57.161]  We dubbed it Spygate last year, and now here it is.
[01:33:57.221 --> 01:34:00.062]  So just in closing, yeah, you're going to get called back up.
[01:34:00.302 --> 01:34:05.325]  But you know, by the FBI, people need to go to caputolegalfund.com and support you.
[01:34:05.425 --> 01:34:06.766]  That is so vital.
[01:34:06.786 --> 01:34:09.048]  But just giving you a minute to finish because we got caught up by the break.
[01:34:09.988 --> 01:34:17.473]  You're saying that you believe a lot more is going to come out and a lot more moles are going to be exposed, making this a lot bigger than Watergate.
[01:34:18.746 --> 01:34:22.789]  It is, and the thing is, the net is cashed wide by the Follower Investigation.
[01:34:22.849 --> 01:34:35.620]  They're pulling in people from all across the country, people we're not hearing about, mostly because they're afraid to talk to the media because they don't want to have the legal expenses coming at them that are coming at us any time you're brought there.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.543]  If you bring in the right kind of attorney, it's 20, 30 grand even to talk to them.
[01:34:39.943 --> 01:34:45.568]  But that's why at CaputoLegalFund.com, we negotiated, we're negotiating with, and our lawyers
[01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:57.212]  Are agreeing to pay the legal fees of other middle-class military veterans who are being called into this investigation and incurring legal fees they can't afford.
[01:34:58.047 --> 01:34:58.868]  I don't think so.
[01:35:17.348 --> 01:35:17.868]  God bless you.
[01:35:17.888 --> 01:35:19.389]  We'll talk again soon.
[01:35:19.429 --> 01:35:25.612]  You have a lot of courage and thank you for helping organize people to not be intimidated by Robert Mueller.
[01:35:25.632 --> 01:35:26.112]  God bless.
[01:35:41.257 --> 01:35:41.977]  Thank you very much.
[01:35:42.457 --> 01:35:50.580]  Now, looking sharp as usual in a different studio, former congressman Dr. Ron Paul, father of our best senator, Rand Paul is here.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.361]  So I tell you, we only got him for a little while.
[01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:58.483]  He's not too positive on Trump on some things, on foreign policy and on the economy.
[01:35:58.503 --> 01:35:59.203]  We'll get to that.
[01:35:59.543 --> 01:36:01.264]  But just up front, Spygate.
[01:36:01.724 --> 01:36:09.407]  This totally vindicates what you exposed in Congress, how they're spying on Congress, spying on the Senate, spying on the House, spying on different agencies.
[01:36:09.427 --> 01:36:09.967]  What a mess.
[01:36:10.347 --> 01:36:11.848]  This whole surveillance grid is.
[01:36:12.129 --> 01:36:15.411]  So I think that's something positive coming out of this mess is Spygate.
[01:36:15.451 --> 01:36:16.412]  What's your view on this?
[01:36:16.452 --> 01:36:20.335]  Because this looks like it's a thousand times bigger or more than Watergate, Dr. Paul.
[01:36:21.436 --> 01:36:22.577]  Well, well, who knows?
[01:36:22.657 --> 01:36:24.279]  I guess we have a lot to learn yet.
[01:36:24.359 --> 01:36:28.022]  I do believe that when you look into it, it's been going on for a bit.
[01:36:28.462 --> 01:36:30.724]  We've been involved in many elections over the years.
[01:36:30.764 --> 01:36:32.245]  Other presidents have done this, too.
[01:36:32.926 --> 01:36:36.249]  And also we get involved in everybody's elections.
[01:36:36.289 --> 01:36:37.710]  We we've been involved in a
[01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:41.512]  We've had 100 elections since World War II with our CIA overseas.
[01:36:41.832 --> 01:36:43.913]  So that's the kind of stuff I'm sick and tired of.
[01:36:44.734 --> 01:36:48.315]  And this is a distraction from the things I think we should be talking about.
[01:36:48.415 --> 01:37:02.903]  Our interventionist foreign policy, our Federal Reserve system, our deficits that we've run up, our attack on our civil liberties, and these other things are a distraction because, in a way, on the big issues, it's very bipartisan.
[01:37:03.223 --> 01:37:09.747]  But when it comes to a campaign, and when they want to look like they're fighting with each other, then they accuse each other of cheating.
[01:37:10.288 --> 01:37:12.049]  And it goes on and on.
[01:37:12.309 --> 01:37:16.352]  And I like to get people thinking about some very serious things.
[01:37:16.592 --> 01:37:19.734]  That is, our personal liberties in this country are being eroded.
[01:37:20.175 --> 01:37:22.016]  This deficit cannot continue.
[01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:25.178]  Republicans spend more than the Democrats.
[01:37:25.198 --> 01:37:26.839]  And ongoing war.
[01:37:27.139 --> 01:37:32.083]  We're just appointing now, you know, the 18th new general for Afghanistan.
[01:37:32.523 --> 01:37:40.568]  And we've been there for 18 years, and now we're talking about who said what on some of these things, which is important.
[01:37:40.928 --> 01:37:47.713]  But I still think that there's a bipartisan collusion on financing big government.
[01:37:48.173 --> 01:37:51.455]  Alex, you've seen me work for years about the Federal Reserve.
[01:37:51.795 --> 01:37:54.117]  But the Republicans aren't any better than the Democrats.
[01:37:54.137 --> 01:38:07.171]  They all love the Federal Reserve because it finances the military-industrial complex, it takes care of the welfare of the state, takes care of the deficits, and that's where big government is, and that's where the deep state has a lot of influence.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:12.943]  Well I agree with you that overall Trump on foreign policy has gone back on a lot of stuff.
[01:38:12.963 --> 01:38:15.285]  Two strikes on Syria when clearly they were false flags.
[01:38:15.765 --> 01:38:16.826]  Faked the first few times.
[01:38:17.466 --> 01:38:20.968]  This newest one, the inspectors got there and said they found no evidence of an attack.
[01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:23.511]  There's been U.N.
[01:38:23.551 --> 01:38:32.338]  reports exposing it, and then now you've got him continuing to stay in Afghanistan, even though he says that he initially was wanting to get out of there.
[01:38:32.859 --> 01:38:35.661]  So you're absolutely right on those points that that's happening.
[01:38:36.662 --> 01:38:43.128]  If that's the case, then why is the media and the establishment so anti-Trump compared to any other president we've ever seen?
[01:38:43.148 --> 01:38:45.090]  I mean, they are really mad about some of the things he's doing.
[01:38:46.311 --> 01:38:57.915]  Well, I think he does pose a threat to the deep state, at least symbolically and what he said in campaigns, and he's sort of erratic and they don't know what he'll do, but policies don't change.
[01:38:57.955 --> 01:39:01.596]  It seems like I haven't been able to figure it out, you know, whether
[01:39:02.316 --> 01:39:08.081]  Whether he's part of the Deep State and the neocons, because he ends up with a neocon foreign policy.
[01:39:08.322 --> 01:39:16.589]  Just look at his appointment, whether it's Haspel or Haley or Pompeo.
[01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:18.251]  These are all neocons.
[01:39:18.511 --> 01:39:20.053]  So he appoints these people.
[01:39:20.393 --> 01:39:22.054]  So I can't figure it out.
[01:39:22.295 --> 01:39:25.498]  But the media still hates his guts, because I think they can't...
[01:39:25.998 --> 01:39:26.338]  I think so.
[01:39:49.015 --> 01:39:49.856]  I don't know.
[01:40:09.397 --> 01:40:09.617]  I don't
[01:40:26.206 --> 01:40:28.989]  Well, take Bolton.
[01:40:29.169 --> 01:40:38.496]  I mean, he puts Bolton, the mad dog in there, and then wonders why Bolton keeps saying, we're going to do to North Korea what we did to Libya, the exact thing they said.
[01:40:38.596 --> 01:40:41.718]  Don't do what you did to Libya to us, and we'll give up the weapons.
[01:40:41.738 --> 01:40:43.520]  And then Bolton says, we're going to do what we did to Libya.
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:46.502]  And Trump rightly interpreted that Bolton was torpedoing it.
[01:40:46.862 --> 01:40:48.203]  Well, I mean, what do you expect?
[01:40:49.144 --> 01:40:53.627]  The reasoning is bring in the Warhawks to have them in your camp so you can control them.
[01:40:53.947 --> 01:40:54.147]  No!
[01:40:54.247 --> 01:40:59.051]  These guys, they are seen to the tune of a different master, the military-industrial complex.
[01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:00.827]  Right.
[01:41:01.948 --> 01:41:09.972]  And this gives them incentives to defy us, because if you look at our history, we find out that if they give up their nukes, they get killed.
[01:41:09.992 --> 01:41:13.053]  I mean, Saddam Hussein, that all was based on a lie.
[01:41:13.073 --> 01:41:17.035]  And then, you know, what happened to him and Gaddafi, the same thing.
[01:41:17.376 --> 01:41:19.056]  Why should the Iranians believe us?
[01:41:19.116 --> 01:41:20.637]  I think we're losing credibility.
[01:41:21.137 --> 01:41:23.939]  And when the dollar goes down, we're really going to lose credibility.
[01:41:23.959 --> 01:41:29.802]  And that's going to be a big deal, because we can't run the world with the financial situation if people
[01:41:30.562 --> 01:41:35.568]  Well, obviously you're right about the fiat currency and the inflation is already starting to come in.
[01:41:36.088 --> 01:41:37.870]  But if Hillary had gotten in, who knows what would have happened.
[01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:40.073]  What do you then make of the inside baseball?
[01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:41.334]  It was going to come out of Kudlow.
[01:41:41.374 --> 01:41:42.775]  I talked to folks that were in the meeting.
[01:41:43.236 --> 01:41:48.722]  They're projecting four plus percent growth rate when they make the new announcement the next quarter.
[01:41:49.798 --> 01:41:51.259]  Well, I think that's all fiction.
[01:41:51.799 --> 01:41:54.982]  That's fake predictions because I don't even believe what they give us now.
[01:41:55.262 --> 01:41:56.623]  Why are so many people miserable?
[01:41:56.643 --> 01:42:00.045]  And why are the people living on the streets going up dramatically?
[01:42:00.465 --> 01:42:04.008]  I think Trump has done great things because he's reduced the regulations.
[01:42:04.068 --> 01:42:05.288]  He's lowered the taxes.
[01:42:05.348 --> 01:42:06.689]  He's changed the atmosphere.
[01:42:06.909 --> 01:42:09.711]  But all the money is going into the stock market.
[01:42:09.751 --> 01:42:18.097]  It props up the stock market and buybacks and bringing these companies together because there's not the economic growth is necessary.
[01:42:18.377 --> 01:42:19.678]  If they come up and say next year,
[01:42:19.758 --> 01:42:24.343]  And by the way, Trump used to always say that the stock market wasn't a real gauge.
[01:42:24.744 --> 01:42:28.027]  I just think he's, I think the economy was already crashing like you said.
[01:42:28.087 --> 01:42:29.469]  The whole world was winding down.
[01:42:29.729 --> 01:42:31.511]  We're going off a demographic cliff.
[01:42:31.792 --> 01:42:34.855]  And so Trump's trying to prop up the inevitable.
[01:42:34.895 --> 01:42:35.756]  I think that's what's happening.
[01:42:35.776 --> 01:42:37.617]  I mean, I don't think you're really blaming, because you're damned if you do.
[01:42:37.677 --> 01:42:39.238]  I know you've got to go soon.
[01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:39.939]  It's a quick break.
[01:42:40.239 --> 01:42:44.042]  Come back in a few minutes and tell us what you would do economically to pull us out of this.
[01:42:44.062 --> 01:42:50.306]  I mean, I know you wouldn't be a dictator if you were president, but what you would have done if you would have been elected, you know, back six, eight years ago.
[01:42:50.667 --> 01:42:55.770]  A little bit more time with Dr. Ron Paul from the Liberty Report with us on the other side.
[01:42:55.810 --> 01:42:58.832]  And then we've got a bunch of other critical intel coming up as well.
[01:42:59.133 --> 01:43:00.934]  RonPaulLibertyReport.com.
[01:43:01.234 --> 01:43:02.175]  RonPaulChannel.com.
[01:43:02.535 --> 01:43:08.539]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:08.899 --> 01:43:11.500]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:43:12.121 --> 01:43:15.563]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:15.823 --> 01:43:20.085]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:20.526 --> 01:43:23.768]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:24.688 --> 01:43:34.919]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:44.229]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[01:43:45.851 --> 01:43:54.395]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:44:07.079 --> 01:44:10.181]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:44:10.221 --> 01:44:10.741]  You're on the air.
[01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:11.282]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:11.682 --> 01:44:12.783]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:44:12.983 --> 01:44:13.583]  Hey, brother.
[01:44:13.904 --> 01:44:14.264]  Good, man.
[01:44:14.284 --> 01:44:15.084]  Thank you for calling.
[01:44:15.164 --> 01:44:15.725]  Hey, hey.
[01:44:15.825 --> 01:44:20.248]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:44:20.448 --> 01:44:26.812]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:44:26.832 --> 01:44:28.653]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[01:44:28.713 --> 01:44:34.917]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:44:36.058 --> 01:44:37.159]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:44:37.219 --> 01:44:39.660]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.241]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:44:41.621 --> 01:44:43.302]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:44:43.682 --> 01:44:44.423]  And exactly.
[01:44:44.443 --> 01:44:48.685]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:44:49.025 --> 01:44:49.305]  Boom!
[01:44:49.445 --> 01:44:52.287]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:44:52.327 --> 01:44:52.867]  It's amazing.
[01:44:52.927 --> 01:44:54.208]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[01:44:54.288 --> 01:44:57.150]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:45:02.538 --> 01:45:11.381]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:45:12.602 --> 01:45:14.403]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:45:14.443 --> 01:45:21.565]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:45:21.986 --> 01:45:27.788]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:45:28.448 --> 01:45:29.789]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:49.444]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:45:50.525 --> 01:45:54.648]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:45:54.968 --> 01:45:57.509]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult.
[01:45:57.569 --> 01:46:00.251]  A lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[01:46:00.651 --> 01:46:01.692]  As above, so below.
[01:46:02.252 --> 01:46:05.074]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[01:46:05.974 --> 01:46:07.075]  Most tiniest scales.
[01:46:07.575 --> 01:46:08.656]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:10.577]  America is building its wall.
[01:46:10.977 --> 01:46:11.438]  Will it work?
[01:46:11.578 --> 01:46:12.078]  We don't know.
[01:46:12.578 --> 01:46:13.159]  Is Trump right?
[01:46:13.839 --> 01:46:16.161]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:46:16.461 --> 01:46:22.445]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[01:46:22.805 --> 01:46:28.709]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:46:29.429 --> 01:46:35.731]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:46:36.491 --> 01:46:51.496]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:46:52.156 --> 01:46:54.537]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[01:46:55.177 --> 01:46:58.418]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:58.759 --> 01:47:02.460]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:47:06.362 --> 01:47:08.983]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:18.536 --> 01:47:22.040]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:24.442]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.403 --> 01:47:35.054]  Alright, a few more minutes with Dr. Ron Paul on if he would have been elected president years ago, what course changes he would have made versus what's happening now.
[01:47:35.134 --> 01:47:37.096]  Basically, what would he do if he was President Trump?
[01:47:37.536 --> 01:47:37.957]  Dr. Paul?
[01:47:39.076 --> 01:47:52.843]  Well, today, you don't have a whole lot you can do, but you could use the veto pen and make everything that they want pass, use a two-thirds vote, because you should veto all these spending bills until people wake up.
[01:47:53.083 --> 01:47:54.224]  And you should bring the troops home.
[01:47:54.264 --> 01:47:58.046]  We should give up on this foreign policy, and the President has a lot to say about foreign policy.
[01:47:58.546 --> 01:48:02.208]  And he doesn't have to send the troops around the world.
[01:48:02.248 --> 01:48:03.528]  There are no declared wars.
[01:48:03.769 --> 01:48:05.169]  Why should he be fighting wars?
[01:48:05.409 --> 01:48:06.450]  There's no reason for it.
[01:48:06.710 --> 01:48:09.311]  So I started bringing the troops home, saving a lot of money.
[01:48:09.351 --> 01:48:14.412]  We've spent $5 trillion on the Middle East since this century started.
[01:48:14.973 --> 01:48:18.774]  And the wars continue, they're ongoing, and they have to end.
[01:48:19.134 --> 01:48:26.576]  And in this atmosphere, when you have a constant war on terrorism, it means that you can justify violations of our civil liberties at home.
[01:48:26.936 --> 01:48:28.357]  And that's what's happened ever since.
[01:48:29.117 --> 01:48:32.818]  And, Alex, when we first met, I think we were dealing with the Patriot Act.
[01:48:33.118 --> 01:48:33.318]  I think so.
[01:48:48.328 --> 01:48:48.708]  Yes.
[01:49:18.448 --> 01:49:19.569]  That deep state will be there.
[01:49:19.809 --> 01:49:23.813]  And it won't be one group of people, five people who run the world.
[01:49:24.093 --> 01:49:25.535]  It's going to be a lot of different people.
[01:49:25.555 --> 01:49:30.899]  They'll be in banking, and they're going to be in foreign policy and military-industrial complex.
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.801]  So you've got to get to the Fed.
[01:49:33.201 --> 01:49:35.443]  And besides, the Fed is the economic planner.
[01:49:35.544 --> 01:49:36.184]  They plan.
[01:49:36.224 --> 01:49:36.544]  They think.
[01:49:37.505 --> 01:49:40.087]  They don't know what interest rates should be.
[01:49:40.567 --> 01:49:42.248]  They think they know what we do with deficit.
[01:49:42.428 --> 01:49:43.609]  We print money for it.
[01:49:43.929 --> 01:49:45.030]  That all has to stop.
[01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:50.753]  A president could do it, but quite frankly, that president wouldn't be in office for very long.
[01:49:51.394 --> 01:49:57.758]  It would be such a challenge to the establishment that what they would probably do, there would probably be an impeachment.
[01:49:58.658 --> 01:50:00.178]  It would be bipartisan.
[01:50:00.198 --> 01:50:04.479]  They could impeach an individual, like I'm talking about, because it would be such a challenge.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:15.182]  And the other thing is, is if you're dealing with drug addiction, which you tell people, stop your drinking, stop your drugs, there is a side effect from that.
[01:50:15.602 --> 01:50:16.783]  And it's very difficult.
[01:50:17.103 --> 01:50:19.083]  So that is what they want to avoid.
[01:50:19.383 --> 01:50:24.364]  So if you want to live within your means and live off the drugs, there's going to be some people that are uncomfortable.
[01:50:24.404 --> 01:50:26.105]  That's why it's not going to happen.
[01:50:26.565 --> 01:50:29.148]  It's going to continue until the whole thing comes down on our head.
[01:50:29.428 --> 01:50:42.042]  That's why I emphasize the philosophy of economics, the philosophy of foreign policy, why liberties are important, so that we can have bipartisan support for something good, and that is the protection of liberty.
[01:50:42.062 --> 01:50:43.724]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:50:43.824 --> 01:50:44.865]  And in closing, Dr. Paul...
[01:50:45.646 --> 01:50:49.228]  I mean, we've just seen the spectacle of this 30-year-old man.
[01:50:49.248 --> 01:50:51.909]  His parents have tried to kick him out for eight years.
[01:50:52.349 --> 01:50:54.130]  They've given him five eviction notices.
[01:50:54.150 --> 01:51:07.497]  And the Democrats are arguing on television and lawyers that that 30-year-old man should be able to live there and have his parents as his slaves and eat their food and use their electricity and come in and out and do whatever he wants.
[01:51:07.897 --> 01:51:10.618]  And then he actually was like bitching and complaining.
[01:51:10.638 --> 01:51:11.539]  We're trying to get him on the show.
[01:51:12.219 --> 01:51:14.000]  Because I want to try to talk some sense into him.
[01:51:14.781 --> 01:51:16.582]  You know, that somehow he's being wronged.
[01:51:16.922 --> 01:51:18.823]  Doesn't he get that that's enslavement?
[01:51:19.084 --> 01:51:21.565]  To say that his older parents have to take care of him?
[01:51:21.585 --> 01:51:23.847]  I mean, this entitlement is just next level.
[01:51:24.147 --> 01:51:27.489]  Bernie Sanders saying, we deserve free health care, we deserve free school.
[01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:29.651]  Don't they know it creates Venezuela?
[01:51:31.536 --> 01:51:40.260]  Yeah, the only thing I can think about is I agree that this is ridiculous and shouldn't happen, but does it rise to the level of the Supreme Court on a national issue?
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:43.581]  Some of these things, you know, should be handled at the state level.
[01:51:43.841 --> 01:51:46.583]  Somebody in somebody's house... But that's what I mean!
[01:51:46.623 --> 01:51:48.023]  It went to the Supreme Court!
[01:51:49.804 --> 01:51:51.445]  Yeah, that's the way it should be handled.
[01:51:51.646 --> 01:51:55.008]  But it's the philosophy that I accept.
[01:51:55.289 --> 01:51:59.712]  It's the power of George Soros, you know, really looking for things like this.
[01:51:59.952 --> 01:52:06.338]  They want us to be noticing these insane policies because they want social discord.
[01:52:06.638 --> 01:52:08.119]  And that's what's happening.
[01:52:08.459 --> 01:52:13.904]  And the social discord that I worry about the most is the discrepancy between rich and poor.
[01:52:14.164 --> 01:52:15.885]  This is a result of monetary policy.
[01:52:16.125 --> 01:52:21.648]  But they can use this and demagogue it and say, well, what we need is socialism and all this other thing.
[01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:28.331]  We need more government if we don't understand exactly why the social discord is coming from the wealth imbalance.
[01:52:28.691 --> 01:52:35.575]  But we have to realize that the wealthy get wealthy and the poor get poor because of the monetary policy.
[01:52:36.595 --> 01:52:39.036]  Wiping out a currency wipes out the middle class.
[01:52:39.277 --> 01:52:41.978]  All we have to do is look at Venezuela.
[01:52:42.438 --> 01:52:43.699]  And that's what's happening here.
[01:52:44.079 --> 01:52:48.580]  No matter what you're reading about on the statistics, we have a dwindling middle class.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:49.761]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:52:50.101 --> 01:52:52.682]  Some of them are doing okay, but it's all based on debt.
[01:52:53.022 --> 01:52:56.503]  And the debt will be rejected because the dollar will be rejected.
[01:52:56.743 --> 01:52:59.964]  And then we'll have to start from scratch, which might not be too bad of an idea.
[01:53:03.069 --> 01:53:04.070]  Major inflation.
[01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:05.392]  That's what's really hurting people.
[01:53:05.893 --> 01:53:07.115]  There's been some jobs coming back.
[01:53:07.175 --> 01:53:08.056]  Trump's tried on that.
[01:53:08.076 --> 01:53:08.898]  A lot of factories.
[01:53:09.118 --> 01:53:09.679]  That's good.
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:13.725]  But there's so much debt, as you said, that then starts creating this inflation bubble.
[01:53:14.983 --> 01:53:18.904]  And it's really a nightmare scenario, and I think the stock market is pushing that as well.
[01:53:19.645 --> 01:53:23.826]  Well, thank you for all your work, and thank you for your daily radio and TV shows.
[01:53:23.866 --> 01:53:32.589]  I know out of Houston are on hundreds and hundreds of TV stations and cable systems now, because I see it in hotels, and you see it in, you know, friends' houses all over the country.
[01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:39.171]  I know we're working together, you know, some of the same folks there in Houston, and Phonoscope and the great work they're doing helping syndicate you.
[01:53:39.491 --> 01:53:41.172]  So just God bless everything you're doing, sir.
[01:53:41.212 --> 01:53:42.172]  Thank you for working so hard.
[01:53:43.072 --> 01:53:43.652]  All right, thank you, Alex.
[01:53:43.672 --> 01:53:45.313]  All right, there goes Dr. Paul.
[01:53:45.673 --> 01:53:47.153]  We have some really big news here.
[01:53:47.193 --> 01:53:54.395]  You heard Michael Caputo on saying that he was basically been threatened that if he comes back on the show, they'll come after him.
[01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:57.416]  And that it'd be the FBI doing that.
[01:53:58.476 --> 01:54:00.656]  I'm not going to back down to this stuff.
[01:54:00.937 --> 01:54:01.977]  People have to understand that.
[01:54:02.935 --> 01:54:08.399]  That said, though, we were getting a lawsuit every week for a while, and we didn't get any for two weeks.
[01:54:08.439 --> 01:54:13.342]  I thought, well, this is a let-up, you know, from the whole Soros-funded, Hillary-funded operation.
[01:54:14.022 --> 01:54:14.783]  Well, look at this.
[01:54:14.923 --> 01:54:16.123]  More Sandy Hook families.
[01:54:16.684 --> 01:54:17.885]  This just came in five minutes ago.
[01:54:19.546 --> 01:54:20.286]  FBI agents.
[01:54:20.346 --> 01:54:21.687]  So more Sandy Hook families.
[01:54:21.707 --> 01:54:24.589]  An FBI agent filed a lawsuit against Infowars' Alex Jones.
[01:54:26.368 --> 01:54:33.670]  I've never even said the name of this FBI agent, and I've never even talked about these people, and there's a statute of limitations as well.
[01:54:34.878 --> 01:54:51.925]  And that's the thing, in my view, it's just a way to put my name out there again, and to say that I said nobody died, and that I attacked these families, and that I'm trying to send violent people after them, when for years I've said that I can't say that Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[01:54:52.325 --> 01:55:04.290]  Even though the government staged other stuff like babies in incubators to launch wars, and they just got caught with a fake chemical attack a few months ago in Syria, and we just cut the funding to the White Helmets, that's all confirmed, that didn't happen.
[01:55:04.930 --> 01:55:10.515]  So because those events have happened before, you have to look at anything when mainstream media says it and say, is that accurate?
[01:55:10.836 --> 01:55:11.937]  The public didn't buy it.
[01:55:12.237 --> 01:55:15.640]  They have a right to not buy, you know, the sun coming up in the morning if they want.
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:16.581]  Doesn't mean they're right.
[01:55:18.102 --> 01:55:30.334]  But I, for years, have said that I believe people died there, and I'm not going to sit there and have the media always reboot it every few months with a new lawsuit just to put into the news that
[01:55:31.832 --> 01:55:34.434]  Sandy Hook didn't happen and Alex Jones said it didn't happen.
[01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:41.739]  And the last lawsuit filed here in Texas never got served by lawyers or us!
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:47.702]  And we've been reaching out the last few weeks to these parents.
[01:55:48.063 --> 01:55:49.003]  My lawyer was doing it.
[01:55:49.924 --> 01:56:00.391]  And I guess this is the response because the other lawsuit filed in Texas didn't get, they didn't, they filed it but they didn't serve it.
[01:56:01.707 --> 01:56:03.508]  And my lawyer's trying to find out why.
[01:56:04.408 --> 01:56:06.309]  I know what they put in there, I didn't say and didn't do.
[01:56:06.329 --> 01:56:08.270]  I mean, it's a very bad lawsuit.
[01:56:08.631 --> 01:56:10.612]  It's got all the emotion attached to it and the rest of it.
[01:56:11.872 --> 01:56:18.255]  So I've made the apologies before they asked me to do it with Megyn Kelly, and after.
[01:56:19.436 --> 01:56:20.677]  The media does not pick it up.
[01:56:21.157 --> 01:56:28.901]  Finally, in the Hartford Courant, I give them credit, they actually picked up one of the five apologies I've done in the last six months.
[01:56:30.191 --> 01:56:32.412]  Oh yeah, we saw this coming and did it before that.
[01:56:33.032 --> 01:56:35.694]  Because again, the media is misrepresenting what I said and what I did.
[01:56:36.454 --> 01:56:39.255]  I saw anomalies and things that look bizarre and strange.
[01:56:39.455 --> 01:56:40.156]  They're still there.
[01:56:40.796 --> 01:56:43.917]  Kids walking in circles with their hands up in and out of the building, not leaving.
[01:56:44.377 --> 01:56:46.678]  Maybe the cops just didn't know what they were doing, had them go in circles.
[01:56:48.659 --> 01:56:51.661]  The media is saying there wasn't a guy in the woods with a gun when there was a helicopter footage.
[01:56:52.061 --> 01:56:52.761]  All this stuff.
[01:56:53.482 --> 01:56:56.443]  But now a new suit by an FBI agent who I don't even know his name?
[01:56:57.523 --> 01:57:01.188]  And they just say, well, Jones permeated other mean things people said.
[01:57:01.228 --> 01:57:01.849]  That's what it says.
[01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:03.171]  That's not a lawsuit.
[01:57:03.851 --> 01:57:06.275]  So Georgetown's suing me for something I didn't say.
[01:57:06.795 --> 01:57:08.918]  All these others is death by a thousand cuts.
[01:57:09.659 --> 01:57:10.741]  And it's a brand new one.
[01:57:11.522 --> 01:57:11.622]  And...
[01:57:12.563 --> 01:57:16.666]  I told my lawyer two weeks ago, I said, listen, Mark Balin, you're a good guy.
[01:57:16.686 --> 01:57:18.027]  I said, we've got to get out ahead of this.
[01:57:18.067 --> 01:57:28.776]  I've got to have a press conference or something and explain this whole thing because the media just is so deceptive they want to just keep kicking it back off over and over again and then never showing what I really said.
[01:57:29.396 --> 01:57:36.002]  Finally, to the Hartford Courant's credit, they actually got the apology and the clarification at the bottom.
[01:57:36.926 --> 01:57:47.280]  But the thing is, again, this is all meant, from my view, to just file something that is defamatory to the truth of what happened in the lawsuit for publicity.
[01:57:47.341 --> 01:57:49.744]  And that's the Democrats doing that, using these families.
[01:57:56.969 --> 01:57:58.770]  We have the best halogen out there.
[01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:00.912]  X2 is from a deep earth crystal source.
[01:58:01.012 --> 01:58:04.514]  All the other iodine is bound, meaning you don't absorb very much of it.
[01:58:05.194 --> 01:58:06.816]  People have great results with this.
[01:58:07.136 --> 01:58:08.136]  It's the good halogen.
[01:58:08.216 --> 01:58:09.677]  Research the bad halogens.
[01:58:09.737 --> 01:58:11.218]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[01:58:11.258 --> 01:58:14.000]  Read the 6,000 plus reviews.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:14.841]  4.8 stars.
[01:58:14.861 --> 01:58:17.262]  98% rating by Power Reviews.
[01:58:17.342 --> 01:58:19.204]  This has changed so many people's lives.
[01:58:19.284 --> 01:58:19.464]  Yes.
[01:58:19.844 --> 01:58:20.785]  It is amazing.
[01:58:20.825 --> 01:58:24.327]  And when you don't have the good halogen, folks, the bad halogens get into your glands.
[01:58:24.347 --> 01:58:26.008]  It totally changes your whole system.
[01:58:26.108 --> 01:58:27.089]  Experience it for yourself.
[01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:30.071]  A lot of people detox in about three weeks, so be careful when you're on it.
[01:58:30.091 --> 01:58:32.753]  I would take it slow, take about a half dose the first month or so.
[01:58:32.833 --> 01:58:36.295]  It made me lazy, though, because I used to work out really hard and weigh 30, 40 more pounds.
[01:58:36.435 --> 01:58:44.561]  As soon as I went on this, I just don't have to work out as much anymore, and I don't get fat, even though I'm older, just because of what it did to my whole system, my whole metabolic system.
[01:58:44.861 --> 01:58:45.181]  We're good.
[01:59:04.545 --> 01:59:12.970]  Person-to-person, mouth-to-mouth, ear-to-ear, you are breaking their attempt to have an iron curtain come down across this country.
[01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:14.291]  But they are pressing hard.
[01:59:14.311 --> 01:59:19.415]  It's a very dangerous game because it's exposing their tyranny to everyone.
[01:59:19.715 --> 01:59:21.596]  And Trump is beginning to move against them.
[01:59:21.776 --> 01:59:23.858]  We've got to keep him in there to do that, and he's got to know.
[01:59:23.938 --> 01:59:30.543]  They're shutting down the grassroots that is 90% of Trump's power ahead of the midterms.
[01:59:30.603 --> 01:59:35.827]  They are coming, not just for Trump, but for the First Amendment now, and I cannot raise the alarm enough.
[01:59:36.147 --> 01:59:38.709]  They think they're just going to incrementally censor, and you're going to get sick of hearing about it.
[01:59:38.729 --> 01:59:39.310]  Just go to sleep.
[01:59:39.450 --> 01:59:41.071]  Folks, they've been persecuting the churches.
[01:59:41.091 --> 01:59:42.592]  They've been persecuting the veterans groups.
[01:59:42.813 --> 01:59:44.714]  They've been persecuting anybody that's a patriot.
[01:59:44.974 --> 01:59:46.495]  And now they're going to the next level.
[01:59:46.515 --> 01:59:49.458]  We can't roll over to this intimidation, or we'll lose everything.
[01:59:54.474 --> 02:00:00.439]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.564 --> 02:00:16.051]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[02:00:16.592 --> 02:00:19.334]  He is Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.615 --> 02:00:21.896]  Under my thumb,
[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:27.642]  Well, you notice I didn't plug one time last hour.
[02:00:28.122 --> 02:00:32.125]  I plugged Michael Caputo's Legal Defense Fund because that's critical to fight against the globalists.
[02:00:32.945 --> 02:00:39.129]  And, uh, you know, the radio had its ads, and then, but what I did get, you know, to help the operation is a loving lawsuit.
[02:00:39.970 --> 02:00:51.458]  And I got a lot of other news to cover, but I'm gonna get into this because they want the idea of Alex Jones synonymous with lawsuits, synonymous with failure, synonymous with falling apart, synonymous with going down.
[02:00:51.758 --> 02:00:52.758]  That's the Democrats.
[02:00:52.919 --> 02:00:53.719]  That's Soros.
[02:00:54.059 --> 02:00:54.960]  That's the globalists.
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:59.001]  That's the Communist Chinese and their control over this country.
[02:00:59.321 --> 02:01:02.602]  Now, I didn't really get to this earlier, but I'm going to cover it in the next segment.
[02:01:04.622 --> 02:01:13.584]  What Trump's really doing, why he's doing it, how you can criticize what he's doing from the outside if you don't understand he's just trying to get control of the country again.
[02:01:14.864 --> 02:01:17.705]  He's trying to just remove the globalist face sucker from our face.
[02:01:18.766 --> 02:01:23.715]  But notice, how many times has a listener and a viewer have you heard me say, look, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[02:01:24.156 --> 02:01:27.722]  I know how people have anomalies, and you see those anomalies, and people have a right to those anomalies.
[02:01:29.065 --> 02:01:30.367]  In this country, you can believe whatever you want.
[02:01:31.263 --> 02:01:44.810]  I never purposely had questions about that to hurt people, and you see how clear it is when I sit there and say, I'm sorry for your pain, but it's mainly media misrepresenting what I said, plus I'm not the person that created the original theories.
[02:01:44.850 --> 02:01:55.316]  The public doesn't believe anything mainstream media believes, and it's a way for the media to reboot Sandy Hook, bring the tragedy back up, and somehow associate me with it.
[02:01:55.736 --> 02:01:57.017]  Like, almost like I did it.
[02:01:59.038 --> 02:01:59.338]  And then,
[02:02:01.013 --> 02:02:04.875]  Again, just get gun control back in the news.
[02:02:04.935 --> 02:02:11.860]  It's like Sandy Hook keeps happening every time they bring me back in the news at Sandy Hook, and then they use my name to help push gun control.
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:13.261]  I mean, that's really what it is.
[02:02:13.481 --> 02:02:14.701]  The parents aren't doing that.
[02:02:15.262 --> 02:02:19.264]  But now you've got an FBI agent that's suing me, who signed on to this?
[02:02:20.825 --> 02:02:23.307]  Like, like, oh, there's the gravitas of this now.
[02:02:24.407 --> 02:02:28.110]  And, you know, oh, now it's in Connecticut, see?
[02:02:29.946 --> 02:02:31.987]  And that's exactly how Soros works, you see.
[02:02:32.568 --> 02:02:33.868]  That's what I told my lawyers two weeks ago.
[02:02:33.908 --> 02:02:39.292]  I said, they've not delivered the suit, and they're not doing all this because they didn't just want the PR.
[02:02:39.792 --> 02:02:47.056]  They wanted me to say something that would then be actionable, that they would then have a suit to refile on.
[02:02:47.677 --> 02:02:48.737]  And the lawyers agreed with me.
[02:02:49.198 --> 02:02:59.024]  And I said, I gotta get a press conference out now to let them all know I know what's going on, and I'm gonna have to probably get on an airplane and go knock on every one of these parents' doors.
[02:03:00.244 --> 02:03:01.625]  And explain to them what's going on.
[02:03:03.006 --> 02:03:05.367]  And I've offered him to come on the show, you name it.
[02:03:06.188 --> 02:03:11.591]  So, just the anatomy of this is like, next level though, lawfare.
[02:03:12.171 --> 02:03:13.372]  I mean, this is next level.
[02:03:13.692 --> 02:03:18.535]  My lawyer doesn't like to go on air, but Grossman in his office is also a famous free speech lawyer.
[02:03:18.575 --> 02:03:24.199]  I should probably get Grossman on, and I should probably get Randazza on, who is really a good lawyer.
[02:03:24.919 --> 02:03:26.140]  My lawyer thinks he's a really good lawyer.
[02:03:27.496 --> 02:03:34.102]  And I might just engage Ron Dizer or something because there's so many angles to this to get him out ahead of what's going on with this.
[02:03:35.003 --> 02:03:38.667]  This is a PR situation because, again, it's not about me.
[02:03:39.568 --> 02:03:42.831]  They're using me as the vehicle
[02:03:44.158 --> 02:03:56.768]  Because Soros, it's on record, put a $15 million out last year to where there's a fund where you can, if you're part of these networks, you write anti-Alex Jones articles, you get money.
[02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:59.190]  And so that's why they do this.
[02:03:59.230 --> 02:04:06.716]  I mean, it's a total character assassination situation that's brand new.
[02:04:06.737 --> 02:04:07.897]  I mean, this is new stuff.
[02:04:08.766 --> 02:04:18.781]  I mean, I've republished CIA declassified documents about them using microwaves and sound waves to make you vomit, make you itch, make your legs kick.
[02:04:18.821 --> 02:04:20.123]  That's what the document says.
[02:04:21.732 --> 02:04:28.477]  I think progress comes out and says, oh, Jones says the CIA, you know, has weapons that can, you know, hurt you.
[02:04:29.377 --> 02:04:30.658]  And look what comes out the next day.
[02:04:31.078 --> 02:04:36.762]  Pompeo says China incident is entirely consistent with Cuba and sonic attacks.
[02:04:36.782 --> 02:04:39.144]  They're having to close embassies because of the exact stuff.
[02:04:39.564 --> 02:04:41.446]  I mean, I talked about these sonic weapons 20 years ago.
[02:04:42.026 --> 02:04:42.987]  Why did I talk about it 20 years ago?
[02:04:44.335 --> 02:04:50.199]  Because it was put out by the NCBI, that's the federal government, that it was going on years ago.
[02:04:50.459 --> 02:04:51.960]  I mean, I'm just informed.
[02:04:52.781 --> 02:05:00.306]  So they want to archetypally set the precedent for the Alex Jones statute to preemptively ban free speech of individuals.
[02:05:03.829 --> 02:05:04.409]  Alpha Power.
[02:05:04.789 --> 02:05:05.589]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:05:05.809 --> 02:05:11.791]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:15.991]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:05:16.872 --> 02:05:24.833]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:05:25.353 --> 02:05:28.734]  The average male or female enhancement
[02:05:29.694 --> 02:05:32.875]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:05:32.975 --> 02:05:34.675]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:05:35.035 --> 02:05:40.117]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:05:40.417 --> 02:05:44.678]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product.
[02:05:48.379 --> 02:05:49.621]  We're good to go.
[02:06:23.249 --> 02:06:27.191]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:27.611 --> 02:06:29.032]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:39.718 --> 02:06:40.058]  Okay.
[02:06:41.219 --> 02:06:51.224]  I want to go over all the big breaking news, a lot of critical information I haven't gotten to yet, that is absolutely just unbelievably important, like the State Department,
[02:06:52.907 --> 02:06:58.572]  The embassies in Cuba, the embassies in China getting hit with sonic and microwave weapons that are causing brain damage.
[02:07:00.333 --> 02:07:09.581]  Just yesterday we were obsessing over this, but Dr. Nick Baggage, one of the first guys to expose it, and they've got articles out attacking me saying I made this up.
[02:07:09.601 --> 02:07:12.003]  Because you get tomorrow's news today here.
[02:07:14.385 --> 02:07:16.447]  We just had Michael Caputo on, on Russiagate.
[02:07:16.867 --> 02:07:17.948]  The gloves aren't off on that.
[02:07:18.028 --> 02:07:19.830]  We're beginning to win, but those of us
[02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:24.711]  That the globalists see that have been supporting Trump are meant to be destroyed.
[02:07:25.231 --> 02:07:30.733]  Now, Ron Paul was on earlier and he was asking, I don't know why the media hates Trump so bad.
[02:07:30.753 --> 02:07:31.993]  He's doing some good, some bad.
[02:07:33.613 --> 02:07:38.175]  But it's because they don't control him and he's restoring the country back to at least our control.
[02:07:38.515 --> 02:07:39.915]  Doesn't mean his policies are perfect.
[02:07:41.216 --> 02:07:48.558]  Doesn't mean he's not appeasing some of the big combines and some of the big corporate accounts out there who would take him out, he thinks, if
[02:07:50.188 --> 02:07:51.109]  He fought him too hard.
[02:07:51.409 --> 02:08:00.074]  He's at least pragmatically trying to get some sovereignty, some money, some control back, and not have globalists in command of the country that are actually out to get it.
[02:08:01.395 --> 02:08:08.040]  So, with Trump, that's what you're getting, is kind of an Eisenhower, not out to get the country, but, you know, not perfect.
[02:08:09.881 --> 02:08:10.541]  That's the difference.
[02:08:10.701 --> 02:08:14.664]  Now, I'm not scared of what's happening.
[02:08:19.147 --> 02:08:22.649]  I'm not scared of what's happening for myself.
[02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:24.530]  I'm very proud of the work we've done.
[02:08:24.570 --> 02:08:25.830]  I'm proud of the stand we've took.
[02:08:26.271 --> 02:08:27.291]  I know we've changed history.
[02:08:29.412 --> 02:08:41.198]  I just can't back down to people like George Soros that's heavily into the occult, who's a Nazi collaborator, who his son is half the photos online are him at Alistair Crowley events.
[02:08:41.358 --> 02:08:43.139]  I mean, it's it's it's it's sick.
[02:08:45.513 --> 02:08:49.454]  And just the stuff they show is simulated human sacrifice and stuff.
[02:08:50.274 --> 02:08:52.114]  Somebody's got to stand up to these people.
[02:08:52.334 --> 02:08:53.274]  I know they're scary.
[02:08:53.334 --> 02:08:54.155]  I know they're twisted.
[02:08:54.215 --> 02:08:55.035]  I know they're evil.
[02:08:57.115 --> 02:08:59.415]  But things are going to get worse if we don't stand up to them.
[02:08:59.636 --> 02:09:05.637]  So I feel like I'm being suffocated when I even think about the prospect of rolling over.
[02:09:06.157 --> 02:09:07.257]  I just cannot do it.
[02:09:07.897 --> 02:09:09.017]  That is death to me.
[02:09:10.537 --> 02:09:13.278]  Now that said, mainstream media
[02:09:15.601 --> 02:09:21.164]  And these law firms and these big corporate establishments are exploiting the idea of dead children.
[02:09:23.485 --> 02:09:25.947]  They're exploiting children that died in Parkland.
[02:09:25.967 --> 02:09:27.828]  They're exploiting children that died in Santa Fe.
[02:09:27.988 --> 02:09:34.251]  They're exploiting children that died at Sandy Hook to project that on the gun owners and say, you're guilty, turn your guns in.
[02:09:34.552 --> 02:09:35.412]  And it's not working.
[02:09:35.452 --> 02:09:36.433]  People aren't buying it.
[02:09:37.633 --> 02:09:44.197]  So then they go, wait, let's then take people questioning things like Sandy Hook that happened five, six years ago.
[02:09:45.942 --> 02:09:54.846]  And then, even though Alex Jones for years says he believes it happened, and if covering all the big debate about it hurts some people's feelings, I apologize.
[02:09:55.106 --> 02:09:56.507]  They never take the apology.
[02:09:56.787 --> 02:09:58.888]  They never take the proviso.
[02:09:59.388 --> 02:10:02.969]  They just keep re-upping articles that Jones is still attacking the families.
[02:10:03.610 --> 02:10:04.570]  Never attack the families.
[02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:06.011]  And why won't he stop?
[02:10:07.031 --> 02:10:11.253]  And then people go on news and say, if he just stops and says he's sorry, I'll drop the lawsuit.
[02:10:14.093 --> 02:10:18.594]  And the lawyer goes, no, no, no, no, no, we're not going to do that because that lawyer knew I'd already said that years before.
[02:10:19.315 --> 02:10:22.896]  So I reached out and I said, did you know I apologize?
[02:10:23.756 --> 02:10:25.757]  And then boom, the lawsuits didn't get delivered.
[02:10:27.117 --> 02:10:28.278]  That's pretty big news, isn't it?
[02:10:29.018 --> 02:10:30.959]  And my lawyers are like, well, let's reach out and talk to them.
[02:10:30.979 --> 02:10:32.199]  We don't know why they're not delivering them.
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.220]  And my lawyers are, but we looked at the whole record.
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:37.561]  You didn't say the stuff they said.
[02:10:38.321 --> 02:10:41.142]  And the statute of limitations is up on the other stuff that you didn't say either.
[02:10:42.611 --> 02:10:45.072]  And then our debate is the slapback provision.
[02:10:45.833 --> 02:10:49.514]  And we're like, we're going to sue the families because they're suing us.
[02:10:49.875 --> 02:10:54.097]  We'll win the slapback suit if we get any type of fair trial.
[02:10:56.278 --> 02:10:58.919]  And there's Texas provision where we can sue the lawyer himself.
[02:10:58.979 --> 02:11:00.040]  So that's where we were going.
[02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:08.824]  I mean, I countersued them in Virginia, in Charlottesville, because they said things in there I didn't say or do.
[02:11:08.944 --> 02:11:09.504]  It was made up.
[02:11:09.844 --> 02:11:10.985]  They pulled that lawsuit.
[02:11:12.731 --> 02:11:13.812]  Zero in the media!
[02:11:14.152 --> 02:11:14.733]  Zero!
[02:11:16.033 --> 02:11:21.878]  Because the lawsuit itself is the big lie.
[02:11:22.858 --> 02:11:31.444]  The lawsuit itself, by the lawyers and by Georgetown and all this, says all these things I never said.
[02:11:32.345 --> 02:11:38.429]  Well, if you file a suit saying things that were never said, you get away with the defamation because it's protected in court.
[02:11:39.850 --> 02:11:42.072]  But you're not protected from the fake lawsuit.
[02:11:43.171 --> 02:11:45.472]  Check right now if Connecticut's got a slapback provision.
[02:11:47.554 --> 02:11:48.494]  Texas has got it.
[02:11:49.015 --> 02:11:50.316]  Virginia just got it last year.
[02:11:52.677 --> 02:11:53.838]  See if there's a slapback there.
[02:11:55.179 --> 02:11:56.119]  So imagine that.
[02:11:58.541 --> 02:12:00.562]  They follow these suits to wait and see what I'll do.
[02:12:00.582 --> 02:12:02.744]  I clarify over and over again.
[02:12:02.824 --> 02:12:03.664]  I apologize.
[02:12:05.285 --> 02:12:12.610]  Even though I didn't really say the things that are being said, I'm like, to try to see if reality has any bearing with the media and with everybody else.
[02:12:15.663 --> 02:12:19.386]  And they file another lawsuit, this time with a FBI agent.
[02:12:21.928 --> 02:12:24.070]  I mean, they got sovereign immunity, don't they?
[02:12:24.090 --> 02:12:25.171]  They also are public figures.
[02:12:25.892 --> 02:12:26.752]  They're basically government people.
[02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:27.973]  I don't even know who this guy is.
[02:12:28.214 --> 02:12:29.294]  I've never even talked about him.
[02:12:30.175 --> 02:12:31.616]  Is this meant to get me to talk about him now?
[02:12:33.878 --> 02:12:43.026]  And then some names of parents... ...that I don't even recognize.
[02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:49.752]  I mean, this is just, I don't even, I've never even heard these names.
[02:12:52.173 --> 02:12:53.634]  Yes, it does have a slap back.
[02:12:54.695 --> 02:12:57.397]  Grade B. So pretty serious.
[02:12:59.058 --> 02:13:00.239]  Texas has got it really serious.
[02:13:03.541 --> 02:13:08.245]  Man, I mean, I'm not scared of these suits, because they're not based in reality.
[02:13:08.865 --> 02:13:15.250]  It's sick, though, the way the lawyers and the media, like ghouls, are doing what they say I did,
[02:13:16.297 --> 02:13:23.185]  They're saying No Kids Died, through me by extension, to inflame things and make pro-gunners look like mean bad people.
[02:13:23.485 --> 02:13:27.550]  That's the psych warfare of Bloomberg and the whole groups that are involved in this.
[02:13:29.295 --> 02:13:30.535]  Shame on Michael Bloomberg.
[02:13:30.635 --> 02:13:31.736]  Shame on George Soros.
[02:13:31.816 --> 02:13:34.517]  And shame on the media and the rest of you going along with these lies.
[02:13:34.937 --> 02:13:36.417]  You claim I'm opening the wounds.
[02:13:36.517 --> 02:13:42.959]  You claim, the lawsuit, that I'm saying this right now, that nobody died, that I'm sending violent people after you.
[02:13:43.219 --> 02:13:44.300]  And none of that's true!
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:46.140]  You are teeing it up.
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:47.781]  You are reintroducing it.
[02:13:48.941 --> 02:13:49.401]  The media.
[02:13:49.881 --> 02:13:50.381]  The lawyers.
[02:13:51.622 --> 02:13:55.363]  And we will prevail on all these fronts if one thing happens.
[02:13:57.097 --> 02:14:02.841]  If listeners pray for this broadcast, support our local AM and FM affiliates and TV affiliates, and buy the products.
[02:14:02.941 --> 02:14:03.741]  And you've been doing it.
[02:14:03.781 --> 02:14:06.323]  But I need everybody to go to infowarestore.com.
[02:14:06.343 --> 02:14:08.164]  Your children deserve air filtration.
[02:14:08.665 --> 02:14:11.406]  We got the best four-stage HEPA filter at the lowest price you'll find.
[02:14:12.487 --> 02:14:15.509]  You deserve gravity-fed filtration systems for you and your family.
[02:14:15.749 --> 02:14:17.210]  We've got the best, the best prices.
[02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:21.353]  ProPure and Alexa Pure are both excellent, top-of-the-line brands.
[02:14:23.305 --> 02:14:23.965]  They're all there.
[02:14:24.105 --> 02:14:26.506]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:14:26.846 --> 02:14:32.927]  Our supplements are the best out there, highest quality from our research, and they're discounted massively.
[02:14:33.367 --> 02:14:38.008]  Our turmeric formula is the very strongest and best we could get anybody to make for us.
[02:14:38.688 --> 02:14:43.049]  The factories can't believe someone puts in 95% curcumin and level.
[02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:44.309]  That's as high as you can get.
[02:14:44.329 --> 02:14:48.230]  That's 50% off right now and ends today.
[02:14:48.250 --> 02:14:50.751]  You've got the toothpaste, 50% off.
[02:14:52.279 --> 02:14:57.641]  This is a fundraiser, ladies and gentlemen, and I didn't even plug last hour.
[02:14:57.921 --> 02:15:00.762]  If I just simply plug two or three times an hour, we'll have the money to beat all this.
[02:15:01.182 --> 02:15:03.402]  But I'm going to do fundraisers like Caputo.
[02:15:03.963 --> 02:15:06.503]  I'm going to do it all because clearly they're not going to stop.
[02:15:06.903 --> 02:15:09.744]  And they also know the supplements are a big way we're getting funded.
[02:15:10.064 --> 02:15:11.405]  We can just ship t-shirts, books.
[02:15:12.881 --> 02:15:13.502]  That helps people.
[02:15:13.562 --> 02:15:13.822]  I like it.
[02:15:13.842 --> 02:15:14.843]  It's a real 360 win.
[02:15:15.364 --> 02:15:19.909]  So they're trying to tinker and watch and getting ready with consumer groups to make false claims.
[02:15:20.290 --> 02:15:21.191]  And we've already gotten that.
[02:15:21.251 --> 02:15:21.912]  Had lawyers look at it.
[02:15:21.932 --> 02:15:23.073]  They go, none of this is even true.
[02:15:23.233 --> 02:15:23.914]  They don't care.
[02:15:24.414 --> 02:15:25.876]  They're not going to stop.
[02:15:26.217 --> 02:15:27.919]  And so we're going to go directly.
[02:15:29.127 --> 02:15:31.189]  To being funded by you and your donations.
[02:15:31.209 --> 02:15:34.433]  We'll still have the products and all of it, but people are responding and they get it.
[02:15:34.473 --> 02:15:35.374]  But donate today.
[02:15:35.394 --> 02:15:37.497]  $3.60 a win by getting products you need.
[02:15:37.777 --> 02:15:39.959]  Infoworkstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:15:40.019 --> 02:15:44.384]  Before I forget, Ted Nugent and I were just talking.
[02:15:44.404 --> 02:15:45.826]  He may be popping in here in just a little while.
[02:15:46.787 --> 02:15:50.111]  In the last segment of this hour with some breaking news as well.
[02:15:50.131 --> 02:15:52.535]  But I need your financial support and I need your prayers.
[02:15:53.356 --> 02:15:54.437]  There's also another angle to this.
[02:15:54.497 --> 02:15:59.564]  They're really demonizing me and assassinating my character possibly ahead of taking me out.
[02:16:00.144 --> 02:16:00.605]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:03.251 --> 02:16:07.173]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[02:16:07.233 --> 02:16:14.697]  Navy had less than 10 major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[02:16:14.757 --> 02:16:20.560]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[02:16:24.022 --> 02:16:26.964]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[02:16:28.004 --> 02:16:28.745]  But he didn't give up.
[02:16:30.026 --> 02:16:30.486]  And he won.
[02:16:32.227 --> 02:16:33.628]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[02:16:34.388 --> 02:16:38.491]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given victory.
[02:16:39.732 --> 02:16:42.953]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[02:16:44.074 --> 02:16:44.975]  And they all died.
[02:16:45.215 --> 02:16:46.035]  All 180 plus men.
[02:16:46.075 --> 02:16:51.938]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[02:16:53.539 --> 02:16:57.782]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[02:16:57.942 --> 02:16:59.603]  But I know this.
[02:17:02.129 --> 02:17:06.673]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced.
[02:17:07.614 --> 02:17:14.640]  With this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance.
[02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:22.466]  I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[02:17:23.927 --> 02:17:27.590]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[02:17:28.542 --> 02:17:30.723]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes.
[02:17:30.743 --> 02:17:36.066]  It's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants, these globalists.
[02:17:38.467 --> 02:17:49.933]  But that said, just like our information is game-changing, the products that we sell, all of them, are powerful.
[02:17:50.373 --> 02:17:52.894]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there,
[02:17:54.717 --> 02:17:56.879]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[02:17:57.239 --> 02:17:59.441]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[02:18:00.782 --> 02:18:00.982]  PQQ.
[02:18:01.002 --> 02:18:01.202]  Go Q10.
[02:18:03.456 --> 02:18:11.164]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[02:18:11.564 --> 02:18:13.286]  They sell PQQ in little bottles.
[02:18:13.667 --> 02:18:23.597]  With a third the dose we put in this, each chaplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like $40, $50 for a little bottle.
[02:18:25.285 --> 02:18:26.787]  Think about that.
[02:18:26.867 --> 02:18:27.688]  It's $74 right now.
[02:18:28.649 --> 02:18:33.634]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[02:18:34.615 --> 02:18:35.916]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[02:18:35.956 --> 02:18:44.325]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[02:18:44.646 --> 02:18:46.367]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[02:18:47.368 --> 02:18:54.372]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product So I've not gambled.
[02:18:54.953 --> 02:18:55.833]  I know you want value.
[02:18:55.873 --> 02:19:12.863]  So we've bought even more of it We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it and we've got it right now At the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere DNA force go read the five-star reviews thousands of go see what people said it did for them.
[02:19:13.323 --> 02:19:14.264]  It is dramatic
[02:19:15.470 --> 02:19:23.253]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[02:19:23.974 --> 02:19:32.497]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[02:19:33.017 --> 02:19:39.560]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:48.074]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[02:19:48.274 --> 02:19:48.734]  That's fine.
[02:19:50.176 --> 02:19:51.236]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[02:19:51.657 --> 02:19:52.337]  I'm funded by you.
[02:19:52.578 --> 02:19:53.458]  So thank you all.
[02:19:54.139 --> 02:19:59.123]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[02:19:59.663 --> 02:20:02.366]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[02:20:06.829 --> 02:20:09.452]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:01.223 --> 02:21:06.564]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is not just President Trump that has an intelligence operation running against him.
[02:21:09.625 --> 02:21:13.286]  My lawyer a few weeks ago, three weeks ago, went to a big D.C.
[02:21:13.626 --> 02:21:23.449]  speech conference with a bunch of lawyers and there were people going around at the event, lawyers, saying Alex Jones killed people at Comet Ping Pong Pizza and Pizzagate.
[02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:34.297]  Now, I've now confirmed all around the country they have people at public events getting up at PTA meetings, at Rotary Club meetings, they're sending...
[02:21:36.259 --> 02:21:47.463]  Local propaganda writers into the public schools to speak to the classes and they get up and they say, Alex Jones killed children at Comet Ping Pong.
[02:21:47.483 --> 02:21:55.926]  So now, it's not just the media misrepresenting about what we said was going on in the Podesta emails in New York, which they changed the subject over to D.C.
[02:21:56.647 --> 02:22:00.108]  and all the stuff that happened there, there's a whisper campaign
[02:22:00.868 --> 02:22:04.989]  All across the United States with their operatives, because they know nobody buys mainstream media.
[02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:06.750]  So now they do it person to person.
[02:22:08.071 --> 02:22:09.391]  And we had this with a live feed.
[02:22:09.431 --> 02:22:10.831]  We only have the archive feed right now.
[02:22:10.851 --> 02:22:13.873]  We're going to find the better quality because the audio is not good here.
[02:22:14.193 --> 02:22:18.914]  This woman walks over to Owen at Santa Fe, this young lady, and says, get out of here.
[02:22:20.655 --> 02:22:23.636]  You know, you're the folks that got killed somebody at Comet Ping Pong.
[02:22:25.066 --> 02:22:26.867]  I mean, and she's not an operative.
[02:22:26.887 --> 02:22:28.187]  She's actually very sad.
[02:22:28.207 --> 02:22:31.468]  I mean, she's like, you're the people that killed somebody!
[02:22:33.088 --> 02:22:34.569]  And my lawyer was talking to other lawyers.
[02:22:34.589 --> 02:22:35.509]  He's like, you know, that's not true.
[02:22:35.529 --> 02:22:37.670]  They would just go and run off into the crowd.
[02:22:40.011 --> 02:22:46.212]  And so they filed this lawsuit in Charlottesville saying I said that some guy there killed the woman.
[02:22:46.513 --> 02:22:50.514]  Now, I said George Soros funding Antifa and the police standing down got the woman killed.
[02:22:50.694 --> 02:22:51.314]  That's what I said.
[02:22:52.394 --> 02:22:53.034]  But they don't care.
[02:22:53.095 --> 02:22:54.495]  They filed the lawsuit and pulled it.
[02:22:55.967 --> 02:22:59.669]  So they could run all these headlines, then I'm sure they'll file it again and run more headlines.
[02:23:00.069 --> 02:23:01.329]  It's a washing machine.
[02:23:02.850 --> 02:23:07.632]  But it's now reached the point of defamation when I'm clear, saying I believe people died at Sandy Hook.
[02:23:08.937 --> 02:23:37.231]  And I make it clear, and then they keep putting it in the news, Jones says nobody died, he keeps reopening the wounds, so they get a huge news cycle, it's now on thousands of TV stations, radio stations, huge press release, has been fired out that Alex Jones has been sued by families and an FBI agent, FBI, that'll be a good boost to the Bureau, standing up for that naughty Alex Jones, because Jones hurt them and did all these bad things and harassed them and is still doing it, and he won't stop!
[02:23:38.519 --> 02:23:39.719]  Who's writing this stuff?
[02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:50.783]  And then, in the Texas case, they filed two suits on me and didn't deliver one of them, and everything in the suit I didn't say.
[02:23:51.483 --> 02:23:54.124]  And there's a statute of limitations even past that!
[02:23:54.244 --> 02:24:04.427]  They just put things in there so they can put it in the news, and I guess they think they're going to find some judge or somebody that'll let all that through, even though it's not true, but then it'll all get thrown out.
[02:24:09.921 --> 02:24:10.361]  Amazing.
[02:24:11.282 --> 02:24:15.903]  It is absolutely just, just, just incredible to see the anatomy of this.
[02:24:15.943 --> 02:24:17.884]  And even if the audio is bad, we can boost it.
[02:24:17.904 --> 02:24:19.664]  Because again, we have two mics, two feeds.
[02:24:19.824 --> 02:24:20.545]  One is archived.
[02:24:20.985 --> 02:24:22.185]  One is the live feed with the mic.
[02:24:22.205 --> 02:24:23.186]  So this is our backup feed.
[02:24:23.206 --> 02:24:24.466]  It's the one that we're able to find the lady.
[02:24:24.806 --> 02:24:25.546]  It's on YouTube.
[02:24:25.887 --> 02:24:27.947]  It's with better audio.
[02:24:28.828 --> 02:24:29.728]  We're going to try to find it.
[02:24:29.868 --> 02:24:34.449]  But here she is walking up saying, you, you're in fours.
[02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:35.910]  You killed children.
[02:24:37.471 --> 02:24:38.711]  Total upside down world.
[02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:46.784]  Now we, I killed the children in Pizzagate, did you know that?
[02:24:49.727 --> 02:24:58.597]  Now it's totally not true, it's like saying, again, they were attacking me with, like, the stuff they did against Saddam Hussein before they invaded Iraq.
[02:24:59.398 --> 02:25:02.121]  I mean, it's full on war level.
[02:25:03.379 --> 02:25:07.661]  While they shadow ban us on YouTube, Twitter, everywhere, you've got to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:25:07.901 --> 02:25:09.081]  You've got to go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:25:09.121 --> 02:25:17.165]  You've got to go to NewsWars.com as an act of resistance in your own private email, and in person, and with bumper stickers, and calling to talk radio, and C-SPAN.
[02:25:18.297 --> 02:25:22.739]  And going to live events that media is in and saying, InfoWars.com is the truth!
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.720]  InfoWars.com is the truth!
[02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:26.121]  Just like you said, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[02:25:26.761 --> 02:25:27.862]  I stood up to Hillary.
[02:25:28.362 --> 02:25:29.543]  I brought out her crimes.
[02:25:29.763 --> 02:25:31.544]  We branded him as a rapist when it was true.
[02:25:31.844 --> 02:25:33.285]  We helped defeat these monsters.
[02:25:33.645 --> 02:25:39.128]  And so they're coming after us to destroy us, and to set us up, and to do it to the President, but we're winning.
[02:25:39.148 --> 02:25:42.149]  And that's why I'm 100% on with Trump, and I'll talk about it next segment.
[02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:44.590]  Why we've got to back Trump and explain what's really going on.
[02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:46.391]  But, go ahead and roll it.
[02:25:46.411 --> 02:25:47.512]  This is a few days ago.
[02:25:48.712 --> 02:25:49.712]  It's the bad audio version.
[02:25:49.732 --> 02:25:50.513]  We're gonna find the good one.
[02:25:50.533 --> 02:25:51.293]  I'm like, go ask Owen.
[02:25:51.333 --> 02:25:51.673]  He's here.
[02:25:51.713 --> 02:25:52.593]  He knows where it all is.
[02:25:54.234 --> 02:25:54.794]  Or Drew knows.
[02:25:55.794 --> 02:25:58.535]  And saying, I got somebody killed.
[02:25:59.315 --> 02:25:59.875]  It's not true.
[02:25:59.895 --> 02:26:06.257]  But I noticed before I ever got sued for Sandy Hook or any of it, they would say in the news, Alex Jones is being sued for Sandy Hook.
[02:26:06.637 --> 02:26:07.857]  Alex Jones has been sued.
[02:26:08.177 --> 02:26:09.898]  Remember Hogg said that.
[02:26:10.258 --> 02:26:11.578]  Oh, you're being sued for Sandy Hook.
[02:26:11.618 --> 02:26:12.559]  And I'm like, no I wasn't.
[02:26:13.059 --> 02:26:14.939]  And then two weeks later, the lawsuit comes.
[02:26:15.119 --> 02:26:17.140]  Because it's all think tank, folks.
[02:26:19.966 --> 02:26:22.268]  It's all the lawyers and the Democrats cooking this up.
[02:26:22.288 --> 02:26:23.749]  They're getting in rooms and discussing it.
[02:26:23.929 --> 02:26:25.009]  They're blabbering about it.
[02:26:26.430 --> 02:26:31.374]  Totally unbelievable organized to come after the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[02:26:31.534 --> 02:26:38.439]  So let's go ahead and go to this clip from last, this is last Friday, Friday evening in Santa Fe, right after it happened.
[02:26:38.459 --> 02:26:38.719]  Here it is.
[02:26:55.103 --> 02:26:56.444]  Yeah, you can't hear that on AM radio.
[02:26:56.624 --> 02:26:59.846]  I don't understand how we have the bad version but not the good.
[02:26:59.906 --> 02:27:02.828]  I'm not mad, but I've got to have it now!
[02:27:02.968 --> 02:27:07.070]  I watched it at my house Friday night in HD on YouTube.
[02:27:08.091 --> 02:27:12.513]  I watched that sweet little clip and thought, wow, this is crazy, and forgot about it.
[02:27:13.474 --> 02:27:14.655]  We'll see if I can get it for you.
[02:27:14.735 --> 02:27:18.517]  I mean, the point is, in South Texas they're hearing this.
[02:27:20.211 --> 02:27:23.534]  In DC, at lawyer conferences, they're saying it.
[02:27:23.774 --> 02:27:25.916]  It's being put out, but not in the media.
[02:27:26.256 --> 02:27:28.719]  They've got whisper campaigns running around doing this.
[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:31.761]  I'll go find Owen and I'll get it.
[02:27:31.942 --> 02:27:33.343]  Or just give me a green light, you are talking to him.
[02:27:33.923 --> 02:27:34.544]  Just give me a green light.
[02:27:36.546 --> 02:27:37.907]  Okay, good, good, good.
[02:27:37.927 --> 02:27:38.908]  You gotta hear it for yourself.
[02:27:38.928 --> 02:27:39.909]  I remember seeing it.
[02:27:39.929 --> 02:27:43.432]  We should know the name of the video when it was posted.
[02:27:44.565 --> 02:27:45.426]  Because I remember seeing it.
[02:27:45.686 --> 02:27:47.008]  It's the one lady that attacked us.
[02:27:47.589 --> 02:27:48.370]  Everybody else loved us.
[02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:51.014]  Which is telling the media, you're failing, Globalist.
[02:27:51.294 --> 02:27:51.915]  You're failing.
[02:27:52.456 --> 02:27:54.518]  Hundreds of people loved Owen and loved Infowars.
[02:27:54.819 --> 02:27:57.522]  A couple people came over the whole time that didn't like Infowars.
[02:27:57.783 --> 02:27:59.044]  So your lies are failing.
[02:27:59.685 --> 02:28:07.868]  And people are just going to go to Infowars.com and Newswars.com and Europewars.com and they're going to see the information and the videos and the articles.
[02:28:08.068 --> 02:28:09.229]  You're going to see them for yourselves.
[02:28:09.269 --> 02:28:12.910]  Just two months ago, CNN was on the news saying, get rid of Alex Jones.
[02:28:13.170 --> 02:28:14.351]  Take him completely off the internet.
[02:28:14.551 --> 02:28:20.913]  He doesn't have a right to speak because he keeps attacking families of Sandy Hook and sending people to their houses and he won't quit.
[02:28:21.574 --> 02:28:22.334]  I didn't say that!
[02:28:23.677 --> 02:28:28.302]  But they won't show me saying, no, I didn't say that, and no, I'm not sending people to your house.
[02:28:28.902 --> 02:28:29.743]  I never did that.
[02:28:31.965 --> 02:28:41.415]  That's a bunch of other investigators and people that are pissed at me for four years for saying it may have happened, but I supported their right to be able to question.
[02:28:42.529 --> 02:28:53.596]  So they've turned it all around with the media and the lawyers exploiting the dead children to attack the First and Second Amendment and to try to destroy me and assassinate my character.
[02:28:53.817 --> 02:28:57.059]  This is real defamation via lawsuit.
[02:28:57.479 --> 02:29:01.882]  This is an electronic lynching to set the precedent to kill the whole First Amendment.
[02:29:07.066 --> 02:29:12.529]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:29:12.789 --> 02:29:20.394]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:29:20.654 --> 02:29:23.816]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:29:23.996 --> 02:29:29.103]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:29:29.283 --> 02:29:31.826]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:29:32.046 --> 02:29:41.058]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:29:41.198 --> 02:29:52.807]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:29:53.047 --> 02:29:57.770]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Mico ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:29:57.871 --> 02:29:59.532]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:05.871 --> 02:30:17.698]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[02:30:18.359 --> 02:30:27.685]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[02:30:27.885 --> 02:30:32.708]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[02:30:33.208 --> 02:30:42.510]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[02:30:43.351 --> 02:30:48.072]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[02:30:48.092 --> 02:30:49.632]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[02:30:50.232 --> 02:30:56.534]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[02:30:56.574 --> 02:30:57.334]  Here's my problem.
[02:30:57.874 --> 02:31:06.301]  When I do take the bodies and the exituant things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[02:31:06.661 --> 02:31:07.862]  Now most people are... I'm the same issue.
[02:31:08.122 --> 02:31:08.282]  Yeah.
[02:31:08.703 --> 02:31:10.164]  Neurological disorders are exploding.
[02:31:10.524 --> 02:31:11.445]  IQs are dropping.
[02:31:11.525 --> 02:31:12.846]  People are in trance-like states.
[02:31:13.186 --> 02:31:18.430]  This is an incredible time to be alive and I'm glad you mentioned that because bodies have just come back in.
[02:31:18.610 --> 02:31:22.153]  It's 25% off and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[02:31:22.433 --> 02:31:23.855]  We went out with the top labs.
[02:31:23.875 --> 02:31:26.397]  We said we want the strongest concentrate
[02:31:27.197 --> 02:31:34.001]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[02:31:47.449 --> 02:31:53.031]  Now, your product is an extract, and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[02:31:53.271 --> 02:31:57.752]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[02:31:58.332 --> 02:32:01.533]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[02:32:01.894 --> 02:32:07.315]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[02:32:07.355 --> 02:32:09.016]  Well, that's another reason.
[02:32:09.056 --> 02:32:16.118]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[02:32:16.198 --> 02:32:16.598]  Exactly.
[02:32:16.739 --> 02:32:23.625]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[02:32:23.945 --> 02:32:28.429]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[02:32:33.325 --> 02:32:34.946]  You think our information's hardcore?
[02:32:35.326 --> 02:32:36.567]  You think our focus is brutal?
[02:32:36.788 --> 02:32:38.349]  Try our nutraceuticals.
[02:32:38.609 --> 02:32:39.409]  Try our supplements.
[02:32:39.690 --> 02:32:42.332]  We've taken Rainforest and made it BrainForce Plus.
[02:32:42.552 --> 02:32:46.334]  Now at 20% more in the bottle and an even more hardcore formula.

[02:32:58.303 --> 02:32:59.004]  Again, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:33:06.363 --> 02:33:08.968]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.256 --> 02:33:25.037]  Ha ha ha!
[02:33:25.097 --> 02:33:28.961]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.701 --> 02:33:35.026]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[02:33:35.206 --> 02:33:36.207]  I got no friends.
[02:33:36.227 --> 02:33:40.251]  I opened doors for little old ladies.
[02:33:40.331 --> 02:33:42.733]  I held the blind to see.
[02:33:43.033 --> 02:33:44.494]  I got no friends.
[02:33:44.875 --> 02:33:45.816]  I got no friends.
[02:33:45.936 --> 02:33:48.138]  Must read the papers.
[02:33:49.079 --> 02:33:50.360]  They can't be seen.
[02:33:54.136 --> 02:33:54.876]  Here's what's happening.
[02:33:55.936 --> 02:33:56.597]  Feeling mean.
[02:33:57.737 --> 02:33:59.137]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[02:33:59.697 --> 02:34:05.459]  It's super clean.
[02:34:05.639 --> 02:34:06.819]  It's clean.
[02:34:07.239 --> 02:34:11.660]  It's like a razor-sharp sword.
[02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:13.381]  Cleaner yards.
[02:34:13.481 --> 02:34:14.541]  Totally.
[02:34:15.081 --> 02:34:18.282]  You know...
[02:34:20.007 --> 02:34:28.531]  I had over 100 radio affiliates when I was, I don't know, 26, 27 years old on 9-11.
[02:34:29.351 --> 02:34:30.091]  I'm 44 now.
[02:34:31.732 --> 02:34:34.073]  And I'd really hit the big time and talk radio.
[02:34:34.473 --> 02:34:38.215]  There really wasn't anybody independent who'd ever done that by 26, 27 years old.
[02:34:38.615 --> 02:34:41.336]  I was on over 100 stations, about 115 stations, some of them big.
[02:34:43.237 --> 02:34:44.577]  They were all great stations.
[02:34:44.617 --> 02:34:45.678]  Still have some of the same affiliates.
[02:34:46.846 --> 02:34:55.129]  And when I exposed that our government stood down on 9-11 and there were bombs in Building 7 because I had the eyewitnesses, the local news accounts, and people in government that told me that.
[02:34:55.689 --> 02:35:00.851]  Of course, it's all come out later that Saudi Arabia was involved, there was a stand-down, and Mueller was involved.
[02:35:02.172 --> 02:35:03.752]  I went down to about 30 affiliates.
[02:35:06.473 --> 02:35:14.096]  And Ted Anderson didn't kick me off his satellite because he was never my syndicator, I just used him as my satellite.
[02:35:14.981 --> 02:35:17.604]  Because Ted didn't do that when people tried to get me kicked off air.
[02:35:17.985 --> 02:35:24.533]  All these years later, I let Ted carry the satellite feed and fund his whole network.
[02:35:24.893 --> 02:35:26.735]  I'm 96% of the funding for GCN.
[02:35:27.256 --> 02:35:30.280]  All because he was not a coward 18 years ago.
[02:35:34.491 --> 02:35:36.832]  I think it's been a pretty good payoff for not being a coward.
[02:35:37.412 --> 02:35:40.813]  But, because I want to go total free-to-air and we'll still have the ads for the radio stations.
[02:35:40.833 --> 02:35:45.575]  We'll be the only syndicated show in the country that's free-to-air where local stations get all the ads.
[02:35:46.075 --> 02:35:48.396]  We know that we'll probably get a couple hundred more affiliates if we do that.
[02:35:48.616 --> 02:35:50.817]  And all I'm going to do is reach folks and save the country.
[02:35:52.257 --> 02:35:54.078]  I don't know what I'm going to do with GCN.
[02:35:54.118 --> 02:35:55.078]  That's a whole other discussion.
[02:35:55.098 --> 02:35:56.598]  I'm just having a discussion with them listening right now.
[02:35:58.379 --> 02:35:58.899]  I want to win.
[02:35:58.919 --> 02:35:59.680]  I want to defeat the globalists.
[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:03.881]  So see, I want to get rid of all the ads of the show so I reach more people.
[02:36:05.163 --> 02:36:10.046]  I lost 70, no 80 plus radio affiliates.
[02:36:10.106 --> 02:36:11.667]  It was like 115 or so.
[02:36:12.988 --> 02:36:13.308]  Like that.
[02:36:13.488 --> 02:36:15.589]  And the station called and said, stop doing that or you're off the air.
[02:36:15.969 --> 02:36:16.910]  You're getting really good ratings.
[02:36:16.930 --> 02:36:17.350]  We love you.
[02:36:17.370 --> 02:36:19.191]  You're good on everything else, but man, you got to stop.
[02:36:19.552 --> 02:36:20.412]  And I said, I'm sorry.
[02:36:20.452 --> 02:36:21.072]  I can't stop.
[02:36:21.393 --> 02:36:22.313]  You'll put, let me tell you something.
[02:36:22.593 --> 02:36:25.715]  George Soros could put a gun to my head and he'll probably come to that.
[02:36:26.256 --> 02:36:28.557]  I'm never going to roll over.
[02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:34.371]  You can grab me and electro-shock me until I'm a zombie, but that won't be Alex Jones.
[02:36:34.772 --> 02:36:38.233]  You'll never defeat my soul.
[02:36:38.253 --> 02:36:40.874]  My spirit is pointed right at God.
[02:36:42.955 --> 02:36:46.316]  And I pray for more discernment and strength.
[02:36:46.457 --> 02:36:47.137]  I asked for this.
[02:36:47.277 --> 02:36:49.478]  I asked God to lift me up against the enemy.
[02:36:50.478 --> 02:36:51.779]  I asked to get the information.
[02:36:52.179 --> 02:36:54.160]  I asked to be able to take down the globalist.
[02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:55.800]  And you know what?
[02:36:57.881 --> 02:36:59.382]  Ladies and gentlemen, where's my keyboard?
[02:37:01.247 --> 02:37:05.231]  I have been successful at it, thanks to God and you.
[02:37:07.393 --> 02:37:10.175]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[02:37:10.436 --> 02:37:13.418]  We are winning the war against Obama and the globalists in the deep state.
[02:37:13.438 --> 02:37:14.960]  We are turning the tide globally.
[02:37:14.980 --> 02:37:16.001]  I'm going to talk about that in a moment.
[02:37:16.241 --> 02:37:17.862]  And then Ted Nugent is joining us with breaking news.
[02:37:25.461 --> 02:37:26.522]  Trump isn't a dictator.
[02:37:26.582 --> 02:37:30.526]  Ron Paul always said, I couldn't turn it all around real quick because I'm not a dictator.
[02:37:30.546 --> 02:37:45.960]  Well, Trump is strategically knowing he's got to keep the system we've got going as he tries to reform it and give us faith back and crush political correctness and get national pride back and take care of the troops and secure the borders and get the jobs firing.
[02:37:48.243 --> 02:37:48.503]  And then
[02:37:50.037 --> 02:37:54.260]  At propaganda points where they're staging a chemical attack, which they were caught doing now, that's confirmed.
[02:37:54.601 --> 02:37:55.241]  But don't question it.
[02:37:56.302 --> 02:37:58.123]  Just confirm now that it was staged.
[02:37:58.423 --> 02:37:59.284]  Didn't even happen this time.
[02:38:01.746 --> 02:38:03.247]  That's mainstream news, but just back of the paper.
[02:38:06.089 --> 02:38:13.435]  Trump understood at that strategic point that if he didn't make that move, it would all then be construed as weakness, and then that would be how they took him down.
[02:38:13.455 --> 02:38:14.696]  So he's being very strategic.
[02:38:14.776 --> 02:38:16.037]  He is playing three in each chess.
[02:38:17.734 --> 02:38:18.355]  I know for a fact.
[02:38:18.635 --> 02:38:20.917]  It's idiot savant level, by the way.
[02:38:20.937 --> 02:38:26.341]  His focus, he just gets in a total zone and works 16, 17 hours a day.
[02:38:27.903 --> 02:38:31.146]  And it's unbelievable.
[02:38:31.606 --> 02:38:33.608]  And all these enemy attacks are getting turned back.
[02:38:33.648 --> 02:38:36.990]  Jared Kushner just got his national security clearance back up.
[02:38:39.693 --> 02:38:40.233]  That's happening.
[02:38:41.875 --> 02:38:42.755]  That's on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:49.873]  But I want to thank all the friends that have stood with us, and I want to thank the listeners that have stood with us, and I want to thank you all for what you've done over the years.
[02:38:49.953 --> 02:38:55.557]  But, you know, we're under massive globalist attack as we're over the target, so everybody should be looking at what InfoWars has done.
[02:38:55.917 --> 02:39:10.646]  You know, I showed you earlier, in March of last year, we first called it SpyGate, and it got picked up by other news groups saying, look, InfoWars has exposed what they're calling SpyGate.
[02:39:11.886 --> 02:39:12.647]  And now it's called SpyGate!
[02:39:13.905 --> 02:39:15.125]  We have the zeitgeist.
[02:39:15.966 --> 02:39:20.647]  If you wanted to use an allegory, InfoWars has pulled the sword Excalibur.
[02:39:22.028 --> 02:39:22.848]  Others can't pull it.
[02:39:23.028 --> 02:39:23.568]  We pulled it.
[02:39:23.608 --> 02:39:24.168]  Trump pulled it.
[02:39:24.228 --> 02:39:24.649]  You pulled it.
[02:39:25.749 --> 02:39:28.870]  But if you don't use Excalibur, it's worthless.
[02:39:32.677 --> 02:39:33.898]  I am using Excalibur.
[02:39:34.138 --> 02:39:35.058]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[02:39:35.758 --> 02:39:37.899]  Doesn't mean I'm not going to make mistakes or stumble or fall.
[02:39:38.439 --> 02:39:45.402]  Or at the end of this, not make it myself, but the new republic, the rebirth will be launched.
[02:39:46.203 --> 02:39:47.383]  That's what it's all about.
[02:39:47.403 --> 02:39:49.864]  I am extremely honored to be in that position.
[02:39:50.184 --> 02:39:54.986]  I just hope that I'm not weak and can be strong.
[02:39:55.046 --> 02:40:01.449]  But I'm telling you right now, I need your financial support and I make it so easy to do, to just commit.
[02:40:03.086 --> 02:40:08.391]  To go check out the supplements, check out the air filters, water filters, non-GMO heirloom seeds, t-shirts, all of it.
[02:40:08.811 --> 02:40:09.992]  Every order gets bumper stickers.
[02:40:11.133 --> 02:40:14.176]  And to order the stuff and try it out and what you like, reorder.
[02:40:14.196 --> 02:40:15.597]  The coffee, Wake Up America coffee.
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:20.261]  The fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:40:20.341 --> 02:40:20.942]  It's all there.
[02:40:21.903 --> 02:40:22.343]  Go there.
[02:40:22.523 --> 02:40:22.864]  Buy it.
[02:40:22.964 --> 02:40:23.344]  Commit.
[02:40:23.464 --> 02:40:25.186]  Sign up for auto-ship on things you're going to reorder.
[02:40:25.706 --> 02:40:27.308]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:40:30.250 --> 02:40:34.053]  The real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen, just came out today.
[02:40:34.073 --> 02:40:37.275]  And it's amazing.
[02:40:39.676 --> 02:40:44.619]  Let me tell you about Red Pill Plus.
[02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:49.543]  Red Pill is the vitamins, the minerals, and other key factors, and preglanone,
[02:40:50.367 --> 02:41:00.536]  But is the precursor to all the hormones in your body and that lowers as people get older and is absolutely associated with doing incredible things for me personally.
[02:41:02.577 --> 02:41:07.662]  But some people want natural stimulant in it as well so it's more of a nootropic.
[02:41:08.002 --> 02:41:10.644]  Even though in a week or so it does kick in mentally.
[02:41:10.824 --> 02:41:11.585]  But it takes a week.
[02:41:12.065 --> 02:41:13.386]  And we've added stuff to the plus.
[02:41:14.427 --> 02:41:18.210]  Green tea extract, coffee fruit, yerba mate, leaf extract and
[02:41:19.508 --> 02:41:22.209]  Garana seed extract and more.
[02:41:22.849 --> 02:41:25.990]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.
[02:41:26.290 --> 02:41:32.732]  That's why we're bringing you a brand new version of one of the newest fan favorite products, the Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:41:33.272 --> 02:41:37.873]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all new version of the Powerhouse Preglanone product.
[02:41:38.153 --> 02:41:46.776]  It features the same great formula that supports your heart, brain, healthy aging process with an all new natural caffeine boost included.
[02:41:48.035 --> 02:41:50.001]  We're just telling you the approved stuff to stay, folks.
[02:41:50.041 --> 02:41:51.024]  Just research it yourself.
[02:41:52.401 --> 02:41:59.023]  Featuring a powerful preglanone base, the Real Red Pill has quickly become one of our fellow Infowarriors' favorite products.
[02:41:59.663 --> 02:42:10.146]  Now, with an extra proprietary energy blend inside, including green tea extract, yerba mate, leaf extract, and more, you can get that extra pick-me-up while supporting your mind and body in a healthy way.
[02:42:10.486 --> 02:42:18.469]  In addition to the powerful ingredients with the Red Pill formula, the natural energy combination also includes, as I said, the Guarana seed extract.
[02:42:19.875 --> 02:42:28.257]  Paired together with incredible preglanone-based formula, the Real Red Pill Plus is a great and affordable investment in the future of your mind and body.
[02:42:28.617 --> 02:42:36.240]  Supporting healthy energy levels, supporting healthy aging, helping boost energy, helping healthy hormone, brain, cognitive, and endocrine health function.
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:40.681]  Providing essential trace minerals and B vitamins, supporting
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:45.101]  Mental sharpness, optimal brain function, and mental clarity.
[02:42:45.601 --> 02:42:50.823]  With the Real Red Pill Plus, you can get the same powerhouse formula you love and added energy boosts.
[02:42:50.863 --> 02:42:53.083]  And there's no better time than to do it today.
[02:42:53.403 --> 02:42:56.364]  It's discounted out of the gates at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:42:56.424 --> 02:43:01.546]  I should have added 50% off out of the gates on the newest product at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:44:46.142 --> 02:44:46.622]  So please,

[02:45:26.539 --> 02:45:36.165]  It has a massive effect and you see many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others they weren't even contest winners but they were runner-uppers.

[02:46:32.973 --> 02:46:34.193]  We are not victims.
[02:46:34.373 --> 02:46:35.614]  We are victorious.
[02:46:35.974 --> 02:46:40.937]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[02:46:41.017 --> 02:46:45.659]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color and creed who love liberty that want to join the fight.
[02:46:46.159 --> 02:46:55.065]  Again, Infowars.com forward slash contest to find all the rules, and I'll see you on the front lines of the fight against the NWO.
[02:47:06.352 --> 02:47:08.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.622 --> 02:47:26.242]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:27.923 --> 02:47:30.164]  It was March of last year that I called it Spygate.
[02:47:30.184 --> 02:47:35.405]  We showed you the articles earlier where it links to Infowars, news articles saying Jones is calling it Spygate.
[02:47:35.465 --> 02:47:36.826]  Now what's the President's calling it?
[02:47:37.346 --> 02:47:43.047]  Totally legal spying, no Russiagate, except for the Democrats trying to plant Russia garbage in there.
[02:47:43.408 --> 02:47:45.068]  This is next level deception.
[02:47:45.788 --> 02:47:49.829]  Then the President's asked in a meeting about MS-13, he goes, oh those animals.
[02:47:50.210 --> 02:47:51.290]  The media cuts the tape.
[02:47:52.554 --> 02:47:55.456]  Where they set MS-13 to say, oh, he's calling Hispanics animals.
[02:47:55.816 --> 02:47:56.496]  The same lie.
[02:47:56.536 --> 02:47:58.878]  But Trump doubles down and goes towards the lie.
[02:47:59.798 --> 02:48:02.500]  And he's able to bypass the media because he's a larger-than-life figure.
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:05.442]  Now he's had his big MS-13 summit that's ongoing.
[02:48:05.982 --> 02:48:11.626]  And I wanted to get Ted Nugent to pop in ahead of a big concert he's got in Waco, Texas this weekend that I'm going to try to attend.
[02:48:11.646 --> 02:48:12.766]  I know I'm going to send a crew, at least.
[02:48:13.207 --> 02:48:15.868]  If you haven't seen a Ted Nugent concert, you need to see one.
[02:48:15.888 --> 02:48:16.749]  But that's a side issue.
[02:48:17.009 --> 02:48:18.370]  We'll get into that with him in a moment.
[02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:19.811]  But I wanted to get his take on MS-13.
[02:48:19.851 --> 02:48:21.092]  He's happy to do that.
[02:48:21.852 --> 02:48:23.553]  But I also want to just get his take on this.
[02:48:23.854 --> 02:48:25.315]  He's an NRA board member, really smart.
[02:48:26.115 --> 02:48:32.540]  I got sued by some of the Sandy Hook families here in Texas, but they didn't deliver the lawsuits, saying that I said none of them died.
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:36.363]  That's not what I've said, and I've apologized if it got misconstrued.
[02:48:36.664 --> 02:48:40.086]  That's really a media lie earlier that they manipulated.
[02:48:40.106 --> 02:48:41.768]  There are people that think it didn't happen.
[02:48:42.008 --> 02:48:43.349]  I've said they have a right to believe that.
[02:48:43.769 --> 02:48:46.772]  But I have been very clear and apologized if it was misconstrued.
[02:48:47.112 --> 02:48:49.554]  The media continues to say then, Ted, that
[02:48:50.234 --> 02:49:03.483]  I am still bringing it up and that I'm harassing people and and so the lawyers have said these suits really are frivolous and that the Democratic Party is exploiting this to bring Sandy Hook back into the consciousness over and over and over again.
[02:49:03.743 --> 02:49:05.344]  So these Texas suits are going nowhere.
[02:49:05.364 --> 02:49:18.613]  All these other suits have been thrown out against me still at great cost and now it's all over the news today that Jones won't stop saying nobody died and so he's been sued by an FBI agent and families I've never even heard of some of these names up there saying things I didn't say.
[02:49:18.653 --> 02:49:19.514]  You're a smart guy.
[02:49:20.034 --> 02:49:23.675]  And so just a side issue, because it just broke since before I talked to you earlier.
[02:49:24.536 --> 02:49:36.940]  What do you, without wading into this, just as somebody that's been lied about yourself, you know, bizarre stuff they say about you, that you hate Native Americans when they love you for 40 years, or that you've done all these things you didn't do.
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:43.483]  You've been targeted longer than I have with lawyers and media, you know, really exploiting tragedies.
[02:49:43.523 --> 02:49:44.083]  What would you do?
[02:49:44.970 --> 02:50:02.464]  Well, number one, on behalf of we, the people, who have a high-capacity magazine of truth, logic, and common sense that dictate our quality of life by making intelligent, prioritized decisions every day, I've got to tell you, Alex, thank you for doing what the Founding Fathers wrote the First Amendment for.
[02:50:02.864 --> 02:50:06.287]  You are the master of spotlighting cockroaches.
[02:50:06.627 --> 02:50:14.513]  And we have to remember, everybody out there that thinks that you're a conspiracy extremist and that I'm a conspiracy extremist, let's really examine
[02:50:15.273 --> 02:50:20.396]  I know you've talked about this before, but it seems to be swept under the carpet and forgotten.
[02:50:20.856 --> 02:50:29.161]  Hillary Clinton studied, under the mentorship of Saul Alinsky, when she wrote her loft thesis at Columbia.
[02:50:29.581 --> 02:50:40.788]  And this is the guy that wrote the book Rules for Radicals, that is all about how to train communists and Marxists and ultra-socialists to lie and lie and lie.
[02:50:40.808 --> 02:50:44.550]  I give you the Barack Obama master liar, the Eric Holder
[02:50:45.090 --> 02:51:06.305]  Fast and Furious Master Liar, Susan Rice Benghazi Master Liar, Hillary Clinton Master Liar, Loretta Lynch Master Liar, Lois Lerner Master Liar, Charles Schumer Master Liar, Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxley, Maxine Waters who's still struggling to find a syllable.
[02:51:06.545 --> 02:51:10.207]  But Alex, stay on course!
[02:51:10.968 --> 02:51:12.189]  The left is dead!
[02:51:12.669 --> 02:51:12.789]  Wow.
[02:51:31.881 --> 02:51:52.760]  The left will not distance themselves from it, and when you and I bring up Saul Alinsky, the devil worshipper of lying to get socialism and communism through in a once-great democracy and representative republic, the left and so many so-called moderates continue to ignore it.
[02:51:53.021 --> 02:51:55.383]  So, Alex Jones, your job
[02:51:56.904 --> 02:52:00.987]  Well, I thank you, and I know you've been through this.
[02:52:01.508 --> 02:52:09.494]  It doesn't hurt me, it's just the level of deception in how they said that he took Martin Luther King's bust out, or he didn't go see Congressman Scalise.
[02:52:09.554 --> 02:52:13.437]  It's just a lie about everything, and we're kind of an elite fraternity.
[02:52:14.398 --> 02:52:27.529]  They attack Trump the most, and then when it comes to you and I, I mean, really, it's Ted Nugent and Alex Jones are the, other than Trump, the two most lied-about attack people in this country.
[02:52:27.549 --> 02:52:31.673]  I mean, I guess Roger Stone's a close third, so I guess it's kind of a good fraternity to be in.
[02:52:32.373 --> 02:52:33.154]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:52:33.594 --> 02:52:38.197]  We're Schindler, and the Brownshirts hate our list.
[02:52:38.497 --> 02:52:39.798]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:52:40.118 --> 02:52:42.460]  We represent, we the people of the U.S.
[02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:46.703]  Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, being the best that you
[02:52:50.441 --> 02:52:51.341]  I don't know.
[02:53:13.529 --> 02:53:16.972]  Stupid to accept the lies from the devil.
[02:53:17.012 --> 02:53:30.821]  So I gotta tell you, the more that the Huffington Post and MoveOn.org and the Southern Poverty Law Center and the MoveOn.org, all these ultra-left America-hating monsters, the more they hate you and me, the more proud we should be.
[02:53:30.881 --> 02:53:32.382]  In fact, I gotta tell you, Alex,
[02:53:33.002 --> 02:53:33.923]  I'm inspired.
[02:53:34.243 --> 02:53:45.029]  When I see people like Michael Moore and Maxine, I'm going to find a syllable any minute now, Water, when I see these people attack me, it literally makes my guitar play better.
[02:53:45.049 --> 02:53:47.150]  It makes me shoot my bow and arrow better.
[02:53:47.170 --> 02:53:48.251]  It makes me happier.
[02:53:48.271 --> 02:53:52.854]  It makes me a more proud American when I spend a campfire with a U.S.
[02:53:52.894 --> 02:53:58.797]  Marine hero who sacrificed his legs for the Constitution that Nancy Pelosi wiped
[02:53:59.097 --> 02:54:04.960]  And I love the fact that you're so energized by just spending all your time out there energizing America all the time.
[02:54:05.020 --> 02:54:06.681]  Thousands of interviews to get Trump elected.
[02:54:06.981 --> 02:54:09.903]  And by the way, you never want to plug what you're doing, but I'm going to try to come up with this weekend.
[02:54:09.923 --> 02:54:14.305]  I think it's about a 90% chance, but regardless, I want to send a crew up there to cover it because a lot of folks want to go.
[02:54:14.585 --> 02:54:18.487]  You're having one of your great concerts up in Waco, Texas this weekend.
[02:54:18.507 --> 02:54:19.928]  Please tell folks about that, Ted Nugent.
[02:54:20.368 --> 02:54:36.022]  Well, again, when you finish your campfires with the heroes of the military, as often as I do, and you're humbled and moved and inspired by that, all of a sudden your guitar plays really driving, outrageous, ferocious music, and we're going to do that at Tucker Hall in Waco, Texas, this Saturday.
[02:54:36.042 --> 02:54:41.566]  There's going to be a whole bunch of bands, but the Nugent band will be up there at Tucker Hall, Waco, Texas, this Saturday, the 26th.
[02:54:42.427 --> 02:54:45.590]  And we're going to rock like three men possessed.
[02:54:45.630 --> 02:54:48.732]  So it's really the greatest music of my life in 2018.
[02:54:49.313 --> 02:54:55.578]  My band is so damn good that they're so dedicated to the music, the guitars and the bass and the drums.
[02:54:55.618 --> 02:54:58.280]  We've got them tuned into such an outrageous level.
[02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:02.363]  It's like NASCAR wishes they could tune their cars as good as we tune ours.
[02:55:02.723 --> 02:55:06.564]  Let me tell you, I've seen you play in person in your house, and it's, I've never seen anything like it.
[02:55:06.584 --> 02:55:10.144]  I've seen some top guitarists play for me privately too, and it was powerful.
[02:55:10.164 --> 02:55:15.045]  But with you, it was like, it was, what you were doing with the guitar, the way you could even do like drums on the guitar.
[02:55:15.285 --> 02:55:15.945]  What's that called?
[02:55:15.966 --> 02:55:22.767]  Because you were like playing it, your hands were moving so fast I couldn't see it, and you were adding drums to, to Stranglehold.
[02:55:22.807 --> 02:55:24.967]  It was like, it sounded like Stranglehold off the record.
[02:55:24.987 --> 02:55:27.028]  And I was like, but like supercharged.
[02:55:27.088 --> 02:55:29.268]  I mean, you are like a possessed wizard.
[02:55:29.984 --> 02:55:58.197]  Well that comes from, I played bass guitar for Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley back in 1969, and of course I was raised on Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry music back in the 50s, and there is a percussiveness, there's a cadence, there's a rate of fire, shall I say, to the way that Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry played the guitar, and you'll hear that in all the greatest guitar players in the world, from Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton and Eddie Van Halen, all these great guitar players were inspired by those same original black found
[02:55:58.357 --> 02:55:59.419]  But is there a name to that?
[02:55:59.459 --> 02:56:03.884]  When I saw you with your hands as you were doing the licks, hitting them as well, and it was sounding like drums?
[02:56:04.525 --> 02:56:10.753]  Well, you know, if you watch the Woodstock movie, and you'll watch, um, geez, am I going to be able to remember his name right now?
[02:56:10.813 --> 02:56:14.098]  The black folk singer that played the song, Freedom!
[02:56:14.438 --> 02:56:15.799]  I don't know.
[02:56:36.955 --> 02:56:40.498]  They call you a racist when you literally worship the black gods of funk.
[02:56:57.486 --> 02:57:05.957]  All my life, I've done 6,679 concerts, all dedicated to Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Jada Brown, Wilson Pickett, Four Tops, and the Motown Funk Brothers.
[02:57:05.997 --> 02:57:06.958]  Yeah, that's racist!
[02:57:09.326 --> 02:57:09.786]  I love it!
[02:57:10.087 --> 02:57:11.287]  This maniac recharges me.
[02:57:11.307 --> 02:57:12.668]  Do five more minutes with the talk about MS-13.
[02:57:12.688 --> 02:57:13.689]  That's why you're on.
[02:57:13.709 --> 02:57:19.873]  I just got to digress in the music because it's so awesome and it's good to be soldiering along with you because we see we're turning the swamp.
[02:57:20.254 --> 02:57:22.735]  The last week I felt the tide really turn.
[02:57:22.755 --> 02:57:29.000]  We got 30 seconds but do you agree that like in your gut level but also seeing the signs, Ted, that we're really starting to win?
[02:57:30.044 --> 02:57:30.624]  Absolutely.
[02:57:30.985 --> 02:57:49.553]  When the left is so brain-dead and so soulless as to try to defend MS-13, the rapists, the torturers, the murderers, the child molesters of MS-13, Nancy Pelosi is on their side instead of we the people who call the MS-13 out.
[02:57:56.776 --> 02:58:02.278]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:58:02.499 --> 02:58:10.102]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:58:10.362 --> 02:58:13.563]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:58:13.724 --> 02:58:21.467]  A unique, natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:58:21.767 --> 02:58:30.812]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:58:30.912 --> 02:58:42.518]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, paldarco bark, and grapeseed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:58:42.778 --> 02:58:47.481]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:47.581 --> 02:58:49.242]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:52.722 --> 02:58:55.903]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:58:56.364 --> 02:58:57.664]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:58.165 --> 02:59:09.590]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:10.390 --> 02:59:19.297]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:59:19.717 --> 02:59:30.405]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:30.925 --> 02:59:33.246]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:59:33.586 --> 02:59:34.926]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:35.326 --> 02:59:44.928]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:45.028 --> 02:59:47.189]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:59:47.729 --> 02:59:52.590]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:59:57.216 --> 02:59:58.917]  You are receiving this transmission.
[02:59:59.317 --> 03:00:13.222]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:13.782 --> 03:00:22.305]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:24.460 --> 03:00:27.942]  All right, Ted Nugent's here, and then Roger Stone's hosting the fourth hour.
[03:00:28.002 --> 03:00:29.003]  I'm going to host some of it with him.
[03:00:29.043 --> 03:00:33.126]  He's coming up with big, big, obvious drain-the-swamp news.
[03:00:33.766 --> 03:00:39.010]  But yeah, the disconnect that Ted Nugent's talking about, I'm not going to play the clip again because I don't want to waste his time.
[03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.530]  We've all heard it.
[03:00:39.930 --> 03:00:50.498]  Other Democrats then joined Pelosi and specifically said, talk show hosts, you name it, Juan Williams on Fox, and I've seen like 15 of these clips, we played them last week, saying
[03:00:51.539 --> 03:01:06.409]  That they're all God's children, MS-13 have this touch of divinity, the spark of divinity are the quotes, and then people defended her when in Latin America they're the worst raping murder gang that cuts little kids' heads off.
[03:01:06.750 --> 03:01:07.950]  They do things nobody else will do.
[03:01:07.991 --> 03:01:09.712]  They're a literal group of devil worshippers.
[03:01:10.072 --> 03:01:17.797]  So no wonder the Alinskyite Democrats love them, but would be crazy enough to come out and defend them in a PR move.
[03:01:18.338 --> 03:01:19.899]  This is true insanity.
[03:01:21.032 --> 03:01:22.854]  I'm a big fan of Chesty Puller.
[03:01:23.155 --> 03:01:25.518]  Everybody out there should know who Chesty Puller was.
[03:01:25.538 --> 03:01:34.230]  He was a great, great Marine who would identify the overwhelming odds against an enemy and actually cherish it because then he could kill more of the enemy.
[03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:35.752]  And here's what we've got.
[03:01:36.152 --> 03:01:49.670]  I'm not even afraid to expose our hand on the Alex Jones Show, where I would normally hesitate to identify that when Juan Williams comes out and tries to find purity in MS-13, denies the video and
[03:01:51.152 --> 03:01:53.493]  I mean, you can't make a more wild leap than that.
[03:01:53.533 --> 03:01:54.333]  But here's the point.
[03:01:54.593 --> 03:01:57.495]  I just admitted, live on the Alex Jones Show, how insane the left-wing
[03:02:22.948 --> 03:02:42.124]  They've been having a public debate, Ted, about whether it's good or bad that they're admitting they're communists and devil worshippers and child molesters and they're going to have the Boy Scouts of America, they're going to hand the kids, all the little boys, free condoms, so it's going to turn into the Junior Swingers Club.
[03:02:43.845 --> 03:02:47.308]  I mean, it's like they can't help but show their hand.
[03:02:47.348 --> 03:02:48.109]  What's wrong with them?
[03:02:48.769 --> 03:02:51.271]  I think, you know, I use the term soulless.
[03:02:51.651 --> 03:02:53.913]  It means you've lost your soul.
[03:02:54.593 --> 03:03:01.859]  And if you witness what the left does and what they say, you've got to admit that can't be soulful.
[03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:25.117]  Just blatantly and unapologetically defends MS-13's rape and murder, lies after witnessing the same footage and the same audio that the rest of the five on Fox News heard and listened to, and claimed that President Trump called immigrants rapists and murderers or immigrants devils or animals.
[03:03:26.419 --> 03:03:31.502]  You can't begin in the world of truth, logic, and common sense to explain that.
[03:03:31.723 --> 03:03:32.783]  So here's my point.
[03:03:33.484 --> 03:03:38.967]  One, all you leftists, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, carry on.
[03:03:39.287 --> 03:03:52.015]  You're doing God's work because you're so soulless and ignorant that you don't know that you're offending the heart and soul of good families all across this country, and I can't thank you enough for that.
[03:03:53.044 --> 03:03:53.484]  Absolutely.
[03:03:53.504 --> 03:04:02.147]  Well, we know a lot of Democrats have been caught, state reps, mayors, running the coyote gangs, bringing in folks into the U.S.
[03:04:02.307 --> 03:04:02.947]  and the drugs.
[03:04:03.348 --> 03:04:09.510]  So the word is, from a lot of law enforcement sources, is the Democrats in a lot of areas are actually allied with MS-13 from L.A.
[03:04:09.550 --> 03:04:10.050]  to Chicago.
[03:04:11.172 --> 03:04:12.993]  Isn't that the heartbreak of all time?
[03:04:13.033 --> 03:04:19.997]  You talk about the deep state when the FBI continues to walk in a building that says J. Edgar Hoover over the entrance.
[03:04:20.297 --> 03:04:22.519]  No wonder there's corruption and criminality.
[03:04:22.759 --> 03:04:32.204]  No wonder oath violation runs rampant in the DOJ and in the Democrat Party and in the Obama administration and the entire Hillary gang.
[03:04:32.544 --> 03:04:33.665]  They don't
[03:04:34.105 --> 03:04:36.126]  Give a damn!
[03:04:36.526 --> 03:04:47.449]  Once again, if you and I went to Central Casting and said, design me an enemy of freedom, an enemy of America, they would design Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and Michael Moore!
[03:04:47.689 --> 03:04:51.651]  So, God is blessing us with the enemy looking and sounding like that.
[03:04:52.031 --> 03:04:57.372]  Well, Ted Nugent, I'm going to be up there at Tucker Hall, 830 Waco, Texas, covering what you do.
[03:04:57.412 --> 03:04:59.513]  Look forward to seeing you again, and thank you for joining us.
[03:05:00.073 --> 03:05:01.154]  Well, God bless you, Alex.
[03:05:01.174 --> 03:05:02.634]  God bless America, and I'll see you this Saturday.
[03:05:03.889 --> 03:05:05.590]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:05:06.171 --> 03:05:07.512]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[03:05:07.752 --> 03:05:11.295]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[03:05:11.655 --> 03:05:19.401]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[03:05:19.602 --> 03:05:24.405]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:05:24.566 --> 03:05:30.030]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[03:05:30.370 --> 03:05:37.918]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[03:05:38.138 --> 03:05:42.603]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:05:42.883 --> 03:05:51.692]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[03:06:10.206 --> 03:06:14.930]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:16.231 --> 03:06:19.694]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[03:06:22.054 --> 03:06:49.788]  Something you call love, but confess You've been a-messin' where you shouldn't have been a-messin' And now someone else is gettin' all your best These boots are made for walkin' And that's just what they'll do One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
[03:06:56.237 --> 03:07:01.319]  Yeah.
[03:07:01.359 --> 03:07:04.741]  You keep lying when you ought to be truthin'.
[03:07:07.002 --> 03:07:10.283]  And you keep losing when you ought to not bet.
[03:07:12.784 --> 03:07:16.426]  You keep samin' when you ought to be a chain pin.
[03:07:22.470 --> 03:07:24.590]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:07:24.670 --> 03:07:26.611]  Roger Stone is hosting this hour.
[03:07:26.671 --> 03:07:29.052]  The Warren's coming up with more of him and Owen Schroer after that.
[03:07:29.792 --> 03:07:31.173]  We've really made the globalists mad.
[03:07:32.393 --> 03:07:34.854]  Announcing we plan to go 20 hours a day this year.
[03:07:34.874 --> 03:07:41.917]  24 hours total down the road, but most stations just went 20 hours and you kind of rear your best shows in the middle of the night.
[03:07:44.192 --> 03:07:48.215]  They freaked out the media when I did a hiring announcement this week.
[03:07:48.795 --> 03:07:53.399]  And we're on the satellites and cable systems are picking us up and it's happening.
[03:07:53.639 --> 03:07:55.060]  300 plus TV stations.
[03:07:56.721 --> 03:07:57.762]  It's almost 400 now.
[03:07:57.782 --> 03:07:59.243]  70 plus cable systems.
[03:08:00.524 --> 03:08:02.145]  Some are small, some are big, they're all precious.
[03:08:02.706 --> 03:08:07.870]  And we're talking about you either have your own channel high up or
[03:08:09.178 --> 03:08:13.639]  You can then just be a provider and satellite that goes directly to the TV stations.
[03:08:13.679 --> 03:08:17.740]  And most of those, if they're local TV stations, they're also on local cable most of the time.
[03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:19.181]  So you're on basic cable.
[03:08:19.381 --> 03:08:20.401]  Huge audiences.
[03:08:20.421 --> 03:08:22.542]  It's all diluted up in the high channels.
[03:08:22.582 --> 03:08:24.442]  But where cable's still big, it's low.
[03:08:25.142 --> 03:08:26.183]  And we're getting response.
[03:08:26.663 --> 03:08:27.483]  We're reaching people.
[03:08:27.523 --> 03:08:28.503]  This is very exciting.
[03:08:28.823 --> 03:08:32.384]  So their attempt to censor us on the web has had some success, but not that much.
[03:08:32.404 --> 03:08:33.945]  But we're really exploding on TV.
[03:08:36.065 --> 03:08:37.366]  George Soros, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:38.345 --> 03:08:40.186]  He's on record financing a lot of this.
[03:08:40.206 --> 03:08:41.687]  It's Hillary's law firms, you name it.
[03:08:41.807 --> 03:08:42.428]  It's insane.
[03:08:42.488 --> 03:08:43.569]  And my lawyers get the suits.
[03:08:44.509 --> 03:08:50.693]  They've sued us now 18 times in the last year.
[03:08:50.993 --> 03:08:51.914]  Most of that this year.
[03:08:52.715 --> 03:08:54.496]  And we've gotten nine of them thrown out.
[03:08:55.536 --> 03:08:56.437]  Two came in today.
[03:08:56.577 --> 03:08:57.918]  One I'm not going to get into yet.
[03:08:59.099 --> 03:09:01.500]  It's just a demand letter and a preparation.
[03:09:03.242 --> 03:09:03.642]  The other
[03:09:06.656 --> 03:09:07.297]  It's all over the news.
[03:09:07.357 --> 03:09:08.237]  Thousands of articles.
[03:09:08.257 --> 03:09:10.559]  Just type in Alex Jones and click Google today.
[03:09:10.599 --> 03:09:12.060]  Click Google News or click Big News.
[03:09:12.581 --> 03:09:13.301]  And it's thousands.
[03:09:13.982 --> 03:09:16.744]  Alex Jones won't stop saying nobody died attacking the families.
[03:09:16.784 --> 03:09:17.805]  Well, we gotta sue them.
[03:09:18.425 --> 03:09:21.327]  And that's the media PR using these poor families for this.
[03:09:22.228 --> 03:09:24.870]  But at least they got it right in the Hartford Courant.
[03:09:27.272 --> 03:09:33.297]  At the end, they at least said, I asked the families of Sandy Hook victims to actually admit that I have
[03:09:34.867 --> 03:09:39.088]  Invited you on for years and admit that I have said for years that it really happened.
[03:09:39.749 --> 03:09:45.270]  And if I have caused you any pain by debating both sides of it, I'm sorry for your pain.
[03:09:45.670 --> 03:09:52.572]  But this is a big public event that has been seized on publicly and politically to take our rights.
[03:09:53.373 --> 03:09:54.393]  The First and Second Amendment.
[03:09:59.214 --> 03:10:00.595]  I should probably take this phone call.
[03:10:02.008 --> 03:10:03.449]  But I'm just not going to take it.
[03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:04.610]  You wouldn't believe who calls my phone.
[03:10:04.630 --> 03:10:05.991]  I'm not bragging either.
[03:10:06.351 --> 03:10:07.912]  I never knew I'd get this big.
[03:10:08.553 --> 03:10:09.733]  This is not fun at this point.
[03:10:09.793 --> 03:10:10.334]  It's war.
[03:10:11.234 --> 03:10:13.436]  And it's survival not just of me.
[03:10:15.758 --> 03:10:17.078]  This is just unbelievable.
[03:10:18.579 --> 03:10:27.566]  My lawyer and others have told me they'll be at public events and people get up on the stage and go, Alex Jones killed people at the pizzeria in D.C.
[03:10:29.315 --> 03:10:29.876]  No one died.
[03:10:30.536 --> 03:10:36.161]  That was a story that the media focused on about reported child abuse going on that was happening in New York.
[03:10:36.922 --> 03:10:38.823]  So the media diverted onto this pizza place.
[03:10:39.164 --> 03:10:40.485]  We covered the coverage of that.
[03:10:40.745 --> 03:10:45.429]  They turned around and said that I said all that and now they say I say people that I killed people!
[03:10:47.110 --> 03:10:51.794]  Troyer had a woman walk up to him in Santa Fe, Texas Friday and say, get out of here!
[03:10:52.355 --> 03:10:53.516]  You guys ever find that video yet?
[03:10:55.037 --> 03:10:55.758]  Get out of here!
[03:10:57.873 --> 03:10:58.613]  Do we have it with a good audio yet?
[03:10:58.634 --> 03:11:00.375]  Because that was the big search.
[03:11:01.595 --> 03:11:02.516]  Still downloading it.
[03:11:02.536 --> 03:11:03.376]  It was like 20 hours long.
[03:11:04.237 --> 03:11:04.537]  I saw it.
[03:11:04.557 --> 03:11:05.598]  I guess when it was live or whatever.
[03:11:06.598 --> 03:11:08.359]  We have the version without the audio for some reason.
[03:11:08.639 --> 03:11:12.542]  But she says, well Alex killed people at the pizza place.
[03:11:12.562 --> 03:11:13.462]  No one died there.
[03:11:15.343 --> 03:11:21.207]  So I'm entering a new level of this where you don't think that he's having intelligence agencies are out to get Trump.
[03:11:22.657 --> 03:11:27.979]  They've got people harassing Roger Stone's family, FBI trucks with the antennas at his house.
[03:11:28.479 --> 03:11:30.320]  We showed the video earlier, Jack Masovic has it.
[03:11:32.621 --> 03:11:34.122]  Going and harassing their family members.
[03:11:34.162 --> 03:11:34.682]  That's what they do.
[03:11:34.722 --> 03:11:36.143]  They go after everybody.
[03:11:37.003 --> 03:11:37.883]  They offer them money.
[03:11:38.183 --> 03:11:39.084]  I've now confirmed.
[03:11:39.184 --> 03:11:46.107]  I have eyewitnesses ready to go public who were in the meetings where lawyers, famous ones, are on the phone, reportedly.
[03:11:47.727 --> 03:11:48.908]  On speakerphone going,
[03:11:49.940 --> 03:11:53.042]  We'll get you 50 grand if you say Jones is gay.
[03:11:56.585 --> 03:12:00.348]  I mean, this is the level of just bonker land.
[03:12:00.789 --> 03:12:02.610]  Oh, we don't want to just say he's a racist.
[03:12:02.650 --> 03:12:03.531]  No, no, no, that doesn't.
[03:12:03.871 --> 03:12:05.773]  We're going to say, you know, he blah, blah, blah.
[03:12:05.973 --> 03:12:06.994]  Hey, so what if I was?
[03:12:07.034 --> 03:12:07.414]  I'm not.
[03:12:07.914 --> 03:12:10.917]  I'm not handing out condoms to the Boy Scouts at their jamboree.
[03:12:12.898 --> 03:12:13.579]  I'm not the Pope.
[03:12:14.810 --> 03:12:16.451]  So Roger Stone, you're taking over here.
[03:12:16.471 --> 03:12:18.532]  I'm going to host a little bit more with you.
[03:12:18.753 --> 03:12:27.518]  And this is meant to distract us from the swamp being drained, and from Russiagate coming out, and from all the lies being exposed.
[03:12:27.538 --> 03:12:30.160]  I mean, they just want to hurt everybody.
[03:12:31.428 --> 03:12:39.312]  I just hope the listeners realize how epic this is that you and I and others have been chosen to be destroyed as an example to others.
[03:12:39.912 --> 03:12:42.454]  Well, I don't think America's a bunch of cowards, even if we get destroyed.
[03:12:42.474 --> 03:12:42.834]  But you know what?
[03:12:42.974 --> 03:12:44.135]  We're going to transcend and win.
[03:12:44.335 --> 03:12:50.498]  They're so pissed Caputo raised enough money that he's now going to represent other people being bullied by the FBI to go public.
[03:12:51.645 --> 03:12:52.266]  I love Caputo.
[03:12:52.306 --> 03:12:52.706]  I love you.
[03:12:52.746 --> 03:12:54.667]  I love the fact that you guys got huevos.
[03:12:55.108 --> 03:12:55.908]  And that's what it's about.
[03:12:55.968 --> 03:12:57.489]  Do you got huevos or not, folks?
[03:12:57.689 --> 03:12:59.611]  Because America was built on huevos.
[03:12:59.951 --> 03:13:03.253]  It wasn't built on a bunch of cowards and sycophants and garbage.
[03:13:03.413 --> 03:13:04.534]  So we've all got to win.
[03:13:04.914 --> 03:13:10.778]  We've got to make tons of money to beat all this, to transcend it, because 21st century war is information warfare.
[03:13:11.118 --> 03:13:11.739]  Roger Stone.
[03:13:11.999 --> 03:13:14.260]  We have huge specials ending today in fullwarestore.com.
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:17.202]  But if the toothpaste was full-priced 12 bucks, go buy it.
[03:13:17.242 --> 03:13:17.883]  It's excellent.
[03:13:18.023 --> 03:13:19.784]  With coital, silver, iodine, nobody's got it.
[03:13:20.024 --> 03:13:20.925]  Right now it's half that.
[03:13:21.825 --> 03:13:26.447]  We've got all these other products, ladies and gentlemen, that you need them.
[03:13:26.467 --> 03:13:27.067]  They're awesome.
[03:13:27.087 --> 03:13:27.528]  They're good.
[03:13:27.588 --> 03:13:28.588]  The t-shirts, all of it.
[03:13:28.808 --> 03:13:29.889]  Wear your colors proud.
[03:13:30.089 --> 03:13:31.369]  Get back in these people's faces.
[03:13:31.429 --> 03:13:32.050]  We're winning.
[03:13:32.430 --> 03:13:33.130]  History's happening.
[03:13:33.370 --> 03:13:34.711]  Roger, I'm not putting a good face on this.
[03:13:34.991 --> 03:13:35.671]  I feel good.
[03:13:36.491 --> 03:13:42.734]  I've been told, stop criticizing open borders and Muslims, and stop calling George Soros a Nazi, and we'll take the heat off.
[03:13:43.354 --> 03:13:45.455]  I'm not taking the heat off, ever!
[03:13:46.176 --> 03:13:46.676]  I love it!
[03:13:48.063 --> 03:13:49.425]  Because I've got your ass!
[03:13:49.565 --> 03:13:51.107]  I'm ramming you at full speed!
[03:13:52.048 --> 03:13:52.969]  This is a game of chicken!
[03:13:52.989 --> 03:13:55.071]  I don't care about making it out!
[03:13:55.112 --> 03:13:56.173]  I don't care about acting tough!
[03:13:56.393 --> 03:13:57.835]  I've been committed for a long time!
[03:13:58.255 --> 03:13:59.076]  This is the spirit of 1776!
[03:13:59.737 --> 03:14:01.780]  This is death to tyrants!
[03:14:03.542 --> 03:14:04.663]  And Trump is turning the tide.
[03:14:04.683 --> 03:14:05.965]  I can feel it this week, Roger.
[03:14:06.165 --> 03:14:07.627]  Roger, what do you say, my friend?
[03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:10.521]  Alex, stop mincing words.
[03:14:10.621 --> 03:14:12.663]  Tell us how you really feel.
[03:14:13.123 --> 03:14:17.306]  I love it when I see your patriotism and you get passionate.
[03:14:17.967 --> 03:14:27.714]  Look, their entire Russian collusion meme has collapsed down around their knees, and more and more Americans are becoming aware of the fact that the deep state
[03:14:29.074 --> 03:14:54.383]  And the epic criminals Brennan and Clapper and Rice and others were violating the civil liberties and utilizing the power and authority and extraordinary capability of the government to have an insurance policy where they not only surveilled Donald Trump, but they also now, as we broke here on InfoWars, they infiltrated his campaign
[03:14:55.163 --> 03:14:59.749]  And as Michael Caputo, I think, reported here today, with more than one mole.
[03:15:00.509 --> 03:15:03.954]  I believe that there is a third significant mole.
[03:15:04.554 --> 03:15:05.956]  There may be a fourth.
[03:15:06.877 --> 03:15:14.666]  The New York Times, the Washington Post would have us believe that the intelligence services infiltrated Trump land to look for Russian collusion.
[03:15:15.427 --> 03:15:19.990]  No, they did it to plant faux evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:15:21.191 --> 03:15:30.998]  So their narrative and the con job put together by John Brennan and Mr. Clapper is becoming known to more and more of the American people.
[03:15:31.418 --> 03:15:42.845]  At the same time, we have 4% economic growth and on the cusp of a historic peace deal with Korea, Donald Trump needs to fire the lot of them and challenge the Congress to impeach him.
[03:15:42.865 --> 03:15:43.306]  That's right.
[03:15:43.406 --> 03:15:44.827]  He must launch the attack now.
[03:15:45.607 --> 03:15:48.009]  And it's time to indict all these people and haul them up.
[03:15:48.029 --> 03:15:48.870]  They want war?
[03:15:49.150 --> 03:15:49.731]  They got it.
[03:15:49.811 --> 03:15:56.397]  I can feel and see in the tea leaves a big red moon rising.
[03:15:57.218 --> 03:15:58.399]  Bad moon rising.
[03:15:58.479 --> 03:15:59.419]  Who's it rising for?
[03:16:10.689 --> 03:16:14.711]  What are you doing?
[03:16:14.811 --> 03:16:26.856]  What are you doing?
[03:16:27.696 --> 03:16:31.078]  What are you doing?
[03:16:31.238 --> 03:16:34.959]  What are you doing?
[03:16:39.478 --> 03:16:58.870]  Imagine a whole gang of thugs training with communist islamicists at a mosque, learn from one of their operatives that Tommy Robinson is at a McDonald's with his camera lady, and then they come over and attack the woman to get the camera, viciously start beating her, she fights back, he fights back, then they run as cowardly scum, and the police are all there and do nothing.
[03:16:58.990 --> 03:17:03.813]  All the way through this, I knew at certain points that with Lucy and with George as well, who are the camera team with us,
[03:17:04.888 --> 03:17:09.100]  I knew we'd get attacked at certain times, but I never thought they'd go for Lucy.
[03:17:09.762 --> 03:17:11.807]  I guess I thought too highly of them.
[03:17:12.586 --> 03:17:13.627]  I thought they had models.
[03:17:13.947 --> 03:17:18.350]  So I always said, and as soon as they turned up and I saw the mask, I was basically getting out of the car.
[03:17:18.730 --> 03:17:19.430]  I looked across.
[03:17:19.490 --> 03:17:22.192]  I see seven men coming towards me with masks.
[03:17:22.872 --> 03:17:25.194]  And then I stood and I tried to move away from Lucy.
[03:17:25.594 --> 03:17:26.735]  I thought they'd all go for me.
[03:17:27.335 --> 03:17:28.055]  So I thought, that's sound.
[03:17:28.115 --> 03:17:28.976]  I'll move away.
[03:17:29.016 --> 03:17:29.816]  They'll all come for me.
[03:17:30.237 --> 03:17:30.737]  They didn't.
[03:17:31.177 --> 03:17:32.058]  They sectioned off.
[03:17:32.258 --> 03:17:34.059]  One went to George and one went to Lucy.
[03:17:34.519 --> 03:17:36.581]  And then, as you can see, he starts attacking Lucy.
[03:17:36.621 --> 03:17:37.641]  He's resting on the floor.
[03:17:38.001 --> 03:17:38.702]  But to be honest,
[03:17:39.282 --> 03:17:40.623]  Lucy gave as good as she got.
[03:17:41.203 --> 03:17:43.403]  Lucy gave as good as she got.
[03:17:43.423 --> 03:17:45.144]  And he ended up, she was kicking him and hitting him.
[03:17:45.424 --> 03:17:50.306]  And even at the end, I looked over and even see George, the other camera lad as well, scuffling with them as well.
[03:17:50.486 --> 03:17:52.486]  But they were masked up.
[03:17:52.767 --> 03:17:53.947]  They were ready to attack us.
[03:17:54.567 --> 03:17:58.428]  And as you're right, straight after this, the police have turned up.
[03:17:58.969 --> 03:17:59.689]  They've done nothing.
[03:17:59.949 --> 03:18:02.050]  No one's even spoke about poor Lucy, really.
[03:18:02.390 --> 03:18:03.210]  No one spoke about her.
[03:18:03.954 --> 03:18:05.014]  I haven't seen one journalist.
[03:18:05.034 --> 03:18:06.195]  No one's contacted her.
[03:18:06.415 --> 03:18:07.795]  No media have contacted her.
[03:18:08.095 --> 03:18:10.276]  She's violently attacked for being a journalist.
[03:18:10.876 --> 03:18:11.756]  They're journalists.
[03:18:12.156 --> 03:18:17.838]  But yet every single report from the mainstream media, Tommy Robinson fighting with masked men.
[03:18:18.338 --> 03:18:20.139]  No, that's not how it was.
[03:18:20.699 --> 03:18:26.500]  Tommy Robinson was getting a burger from McDonald's and his camera girl and his cameraman were violently attacked.
[03:18:26.660 --> 03:18:31.682]  Well, we've known it's this bad for some time now and me and my friends often say that
[03:18:32.262 --> 03:18:41.593]  The day that Richard Spencer got punched was the day when the bar was set very, very low because we saw how many people celebrated it afterwards, how many people fetishized it.
[03:18:41.894 --> 03:18:44.497]  We saw the memes coming out saying, punch a Nazi.
[03:18:44.817 --> 03:18:46.219]  It's okay to punch a Nazi.
[03:18:46.779 --> 03:18:48.381]  And of course, you know, who's a Nazi?
[03:18:48.421 --> 03:18:49.422]  Well, we decide that.
[03:18:49.482 --> 03:18:52.226]  So we've realized that it's going to be violent for some time.
[03:18:52.846 --> 03:18:57.068]  The most shocking thing, actually, the most upsetting thing was how many people are saying it's fake or it's staged.
[03:18:57.188 --> 03:19:02.910]  People seem to think that Tommy has hired these people to come and attack us, which if he had, I think I might have to have a little word with him.
[03:19:03.771 --> 03:19:12.154]  But it's funny, quite a lot of people probably like to call themselves feminists and like to say that they stand up for women's rights, and yet here's a video of a woman on the floor
[03:19:13.055 --> 03:19:17.681]  And, oh, it's fake, it's staged, or even better, I've seen some people say that I deserved it, which is very annoying.
[03:19:17.721 --> 03:19:25.572]  Some of my friends who are quite normal, who have normal parents, who think that everything's fine and the media don't lie, they saw that clip and it actually did make them realise how bad it is.
[03:19:25.632 --> 03:19:28.116]  So, in a way, you have to be able to show that.
[03:19:28.636 --> 03:19:34.000]  The extremes for people to wake up and realise actually, yes, this is what this is what's happening on the streets.
[03:19:34.061 --> 03:19:34.741]  This is what's happening.
[03:19:34.781 --> 03:19:38.444]  It's not being reported and it is being celebrated because I'm in this world.
[03:19:38.484 --> 03:19:39.385]  I know what to expect.
[03:19:39.425 --> 03:19:39.905]  We all do.
[03:19:39.965 --> 03:19:40.886]  We all know what happens.
[03:19:40.926 --> 03:19:42.667]  I've seen Tommy get in trouble before.
[03:19:42.728 --> 03:19:43.708]  It's just what happens.
[03:19:43.728 --> 03:19:50.374]  But I mean, there is a part of me that does feel sad when I realise that actually no, no single media outlet has got in touch with me.
[03:19:50.434 --> 03:19:52.515]  I've had maybe one friend get in touch with me.
[03:19:52.916 --> 03:19:54.417]  This is sort of something that's just going to get
[03:19:54.757 --> 03:19:59.498]  I mean, this is classic authoritarian nightmare dystopia we're talking about.
[03:20:05.680 --> 03:20:08.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.941 --> 03:20:18.643]  All right, Roger Stone and Alex Jones hosting.
[03:20:18.663 --> 03:20:19.843]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.723 --> 03:20:22.104]  Roger's taking over here in a little while.
[03:20:22.987 --> 03:20:26.270]  And he's got some really bad news about what's happening in the Trump campaign.
[03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:32.995]  And remember, he's the guy that first exposed the Soros mole inside the White House.
[03:20:34.296 --> 03:20:39.320]  And the president then removed that mole, and he removed Deshar McMaster.
[03:20:40.361 --> 03:20:46.105]  And he's got some unfortunate news about a new major mole in the next segment.
[03:20:46.145 --> 03:20:47.786]  But the Michael Caputo interview was so big,
[03:20:49.269 --> 03:20:57.162]  He said inside the White House now there could be hundreds of moles and way more than two during the campaign, so that's going to be a really important piece of news.
[03:20:57.783 --> 03:21:00.147]  See Trump really getting out, really getting aggressive?
[03:21:00.990 --> 03:21:07.552]  Calling it the criminal deep state, starting a criminal investigation via the Inspector General.
[03:21:08.052 --> 03:21:14.333]  Okay, they're going after Trump's lawyer because his taxicab partner might not have paid all his taxes.
[03:21:14.353 --> 03:21:21.595]  And the taxicab partner says, by the way, Michael Cohen is a non-voting member.
[03:21:21.635 --> 03:21:22.895]  He's not involved.
[03:21:22.915 --> 03:21:23.675]  He's just an investor.
[03:21:24.116 --> 03:21:25.056]  So that's what they've got.
[03:21:25.356 --> 03:21:28.717]  Taxes on taxicabs in New York with a disgraced
[03:21:31.351 --> 03:21:32.532]  Schneiderman, idiot!
[03:21:33.072 --> 03:21:34.433]  I mean, it's all unraveling.
[03:21:34.453 --> 03:21:35.434]  You can see the momentum.
[03:21:35.774 --> 03:21:36.654]  You can see it happening.
[03:21:36.674 --> 03:21:37.595]  But they're not giving up.
[03:21:37.655 --> 03:21:42.338]  And they're so crazy, they jumped the shark with the edited MS-13 clip.
[03:21:42.758 --> 03:21:43.999]  Everybody saw the real clip.
[03:21:44.719 --> 03:21:46.740]  Just like when they said Hillary didn't fall down, she stumbled.
[03:21:46.940 --> 03:21:48.281]  They cut the clip with the stumble.
[03:21:48.501 --> 03:21:49.762]  But we had the clip of her falling down.
[03:21:50.102 --> 03:21:54.285]  They just keep operating like they're in a vacuum and that they've got air superiority.
[03:21:54.525 --> 03:21:58.608]  Just because they censor us some doesn't mean the public isn't awake to them and hates their guts!
[03:21:59.228 --> 03:22:00.469]  So now I've confirmed, Roger,
[03:22:01.499 --> 03:22:05.020]  They're using intelligence agency whisper campaigns on me.
[03:22:05.961 --> 03:22:18.626]  I've confirmed from one video and three people that in Texas and in New York and in DC and in California, there'll be Rotary Club meetings, PTAs, actually more sources, it was in a couple news articles.
[03:22:19.106 --> 03:22:25.729]  They go, they send in local globalist operatives, their local newspaper writers, and they go in to the local papers
[03:22:27.113 --> 03:22:28.674]  And then they get their marching orders.
[03:22:28.694 --> 03:22:29.774]  It's the same all over the country.
[03:22:30.034 --> 03:22:34.796]  They go into the high schools or middle schools and particularly target girls groups.
[03:22:35.177 --> 03:22:36.217]  That was the whole Hillary plan.
[03:22:37.157 --> 03:22:40.339]  And tell them Alex Jones got people killed at the pizzeria.
[03:22:41.019 --> 03:22:42.300]  Alex Jones physically attacks.
[03:22:43.180 --> 03:22:45.661]  You know, parents of the Sandy Hook, he sends people to their houses.
[03:22:45.681 --> 03:22:46.602]  None of that's even true.
[03:22:47.002 --> 03:22:53.085]  And so, Owen has people at Santa Fe, we now have the clip, coming up and saying that to him.
[03:22:53.325 --> 03:22:58.388]  So this is, they have put out an industrial level takedown Alex Jones operation.
[03:22:58.648 --> 03:23:02.130]  And I gotta tell you, I'm not saying this to build myself up, and I'm sure they're doing it to you too.
[03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:04.311]  They got white trucks out front of your house that are FBI.
[03:23:05.832 --> 03:23:07.794]  What, what is, what are they doing?
[03:23:07.854 --> 03:23:08.955]  It doesn't even scare me.
[03:23:09.395 --> 03:23:12.778]  I mean, I feel like I've been, you know, knighted Sir Lancelot or something.
[03:23:13.218 --> 03:23:23.526]  What are the, I mean, this is mega level, when it's not even news level, when they've got intelligence agency level whisper campaigns, normally only used to take down governments.
[03:23:23.626 --> 03:23:24.607]  What is going on, Roger?
[03:23:25.507 --> 03:23:31.168]  Look, Alex, the left has decided that this false narrative about Sandy Hook is the way to discredit you.
[03:23:32.049 --> 03:23:41.531]  It's like Roger Stone had advanced knowledge of the hacking of the DNC, and he passed email from WikiLeaks on to Donald Trump.
[03:23:42.071 --> 03:23:46.332]  It's a fake narrative, but they believe it hurts you, so they keep repeating it.
[03:23:46.472 --> 03:23:49.933]  You're going to bear this cross, it's going to be in your obituary.
[03:23:50.033 --> 03:23:52.634]  It's a smear on you based on the facts.
[03:23:53.174 --> 03:23:54.015]  You never said it.
[03:23:54.375 --> 03:23:55.476]  You've been respectful.
[03:23:55.736 --> 03:23:58.818]  You've clarified it a hundred times, but they want to tag you with it.
[03:23:59.179 --> 03:24:01.841]  This is how the fake news media works.
[03:24:02.881 --> 03:24:12.689]  And, you know, once great news organizations like the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post are just as bad as the Daily Beast and the, you know, and Raw Story.
[03:24:12.989 --> 03:24:14.210]  It's just garbage.
[03:24:15.611 --> 03:24:18.353]  At a certain point, you can say, well, I need to correct this.
[03:24:18.473 --> 03:24:19.314]  I need to correct that.
[03:24:19.754 --> 03:24:20.975]  Frankly, you have to ignore it.
[03:24:21.076 --> 03:24:22.617]  It's a false narrative.
[03:24:23.037 --> 03:24:24.519]  It's meant to distract you.
[03:24:25.399 --> 03:24:28.903]  As you know, you and I are both being sued every time you turn around.
[03:24:29.403 --> 03:24:38.932]  I have three former staff members of the DNC who are suing me in the District of Columbia, propped up by an Obama fundraising group.
[03:24:39.352 --> 03:24:56.983]  And they are punishing me not for the dissemination of hate speech, not for the dissemination of defamatory speech, not for the dissemination of speech other than within the context
[03:24:57.583 --> 03:24:58.904]  Of the presidential election.
[03:24:59.264 --> 03:25:10.148]  This fantasy that I worked with the Russians to hack the DNC and pass the information to WikiLeaks, thus being published and embarrassing these three plaintiffs, is a fairy tale.
[03:25:10.188 --> 03:25:12.468]  The judge wasn't buying it last week.
[03:25:12.488 --> 03:25:16.070]  Well exactly, you just want a defamation case that they put out against you.
[03:25:16.090 --> 03:25:18.611]  But expanding on that, that's what let's just have to understand.
[03:25:18.691 --> 03:25:19.471]  This is the fight
[03:25:20.342 --> 03:25:23.345]  They must go to Infowarsstore.com and get your new book.
[03:25:23.705 --> 03:25:27.949]  They must go to Infowarsstore.com and buy 10 copies and then donate them to the local library.
[03:25:27.989 --> 03:25:29.871]  This is a war, and I appreciate the listeners.
[03:25:30.191 --> 03:25:34.595]  I'm not complaining at the listeners, but I have to come to grips with the fact that we are now seeing
[03:25:35.776 --> 03:25:45.624]  If, like, Trump's the big mothership and there's a couple of other nurse ships, is what they call them, that support the mothership, they'll usually be the other two big consort ships, okay?
[03:25:46.104 --> 03:25:49.987]  They are putting down fire on us, second only to Trump.
[03:25:50.508 --> 03:25:54.451]  So you have to understand, like, we are in the main attack.
[03:25:54.771 --> 03:25:56.372]  They are after us.
[03:25:56.473 --> 03:25:57.894]  So we need financial support.
[03:25:58.154 --> 03:25:58.714]  I make it easy.
[03:25:58.754 --> 03:26:00.316]  Go buy our products, InfoWarshaw.com.
[03:26:01.377 --> 03:26:02.338]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[03:26:02.358 --> 03:26:03.399]  These are amazing products.
[03:26:03.519 --> 03:26:04.800]  Your children need water filtration.
[03:26:04.820 --> 03:26:05.901]  They need air filtration in your house.
[03:26:05.921 --> 03:26:07.142]  This is all high quality, low cost.
[03:26:07.402 --> 03:26:08.403]  Go to InfoWareStore.com.
[03:26:08.743 --> 03:26:11.466]  Roger, tell folks about your new book, available at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:26:11.929 --> 03:26:13.490]  Well, Alex, I'm glad you asked.
[03:26:13.590 --> 03:26:15.671]  My new book, Stone's Rules, there it is.
[03:26:16.111 --> 03:26:20.874]  This is the book that could be for us what the Alinsky Manual is for the left.
[03:26:20.974 --> 03:26:23.995]  Although, in fact, these are good rules for anybody.
[03:26:24.236 --> 03:26:31.980]  Kind of my maxims, my guidelines to succeed at politics, business, media, agriculture,
[03:26:32.860 --> 03:26:36.463]  Fashion, you know, these are my rules of the road.
[03:26:36.584 --> 03:26:40.087]  And when you buy at the Infowars store, you get a special price.
[03:26:40.487 --> 03:26:41.928]  It helps the Stone family.
[03:26:41.968 --> 03:26:48.554]  Look, Alex, let's face it, selling our great products, our t-shirts, our nutraceuticals isn't going to be enough.
[03:26:48.954 --> 03:26:55.100]  We have to launch the Infowars Legal Defense Fund because the whole goal here is to bankrupt us.
[03:26:55.760 --> 03:26:58.342]  I can't bear these enormous costs.
[03:26:58.442 --> 03:27:20.154]  Not only do I have to deal with two phony lawsuits, the investigations of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, and now the gumshoes of Robert Mueller over every molecule of my existence, finding no Russian collusion, finding no trafficking of alleged hacked emails with WikiLeaks, finding no evidence that I
[03:27:20.814 --> 03:27:21.255]  I don't
[03:27:37.296 --> 03:27:44.520]  If what they're doing to yourself, me, Ted Nugent loses about 10 million a year, they won't have him anywhere but Little Mom and Pop places, which is great.
[03:27:44.940 --> 03:27:46.341]  It all sells out to bankrupt him.
[03:27:46.581 --> 03:27:49.883]  But he's proud that happened because he's already been successful.
[03:27:50.283 --> 03:27:51.464]  This is a real war.
[03:27:51.624 --> 03:27:54.745]  And if they get us, they're going to duplicate it with everybody.
[03:27:54.785 --> 03:27:55.726]  They're total bullies.
[03:27:56.206 --> 03:27:57.027]  It's out of control.
[03:27:58.007 --> 03:27:59.767]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for what you've done.
[03:28:00.228 --> 03:28:02.828]  Please support our local AM and FM affiliates, TV affiliates.
[03:28:03.148 --> 03:28:04.109]  Support their sponsors.
[03:28:04.149 --> 03:28:06.729]  But the way to support us is InfoWorksStore.com.
[03:28:06.869 --> 03:28:08.990]  Go there and get Roger's new book.
[03:28:09.890 --> 03:28:12.210]  Get our new Red Pill Plush.
[03:28:12.451 --> 03:28:16.532]  It's got all the great stuff that Real Red Pill has, but it's also got the boost in it.
[03:28:16.872 --> 03:28:18.432]  It's an amazing product.
[03:28:18.452 --> 03:28:26.534]  The brain boost isn't as strong as Brain Force, but it's got a big boost in it, the healthy boost, on top of the vitamins, minerals, and preglanone.
[03:28:27.907 --> 03:28:29.248]  Red Pill Plus.
[03:28:29.348 --> 03:28:30.168]  We have a lot of products.
[03:28:30.549 --> 03:28:31.529]  Some are different from others.
[03:28:32.530 --> 03:28:34.111]  Our guest says he likes to stack them.
[03:28:34.171 --> 03:28:35.652]  It's all up to you, what you do personally.
[03:28:35.912 --> 03:28:38.774]  A bunch of big specials in today, but 50% off, out of the gates.
[03:28:39.114 --> 03:28:41.236]  The real Red Pill Plus at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:28:41.556 --> 03:28:44.157]  And they're really freaking out because we're expanding in the face of this.
[03:28:44.598 --> 03:28:47.419]  All sale is on, all the coals in the furnace.
[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:49.521]  Ramming speed, ramming speed.
[03:28:49.561 --> 03:28:50.922]  Accelerate, accelerate.
[03:28:51.222 --> 03:28:51.802]  Ram them!
[03:28:51.842 --> 03:28:52.683]  We're going in!
[03:28:54.036 --> 03:28:55.756]  Yeah, we've only begun to fight!
[03:28:56.417 --> 03:29:00.778]  Loading those guns and slamming them up during the breach and pulling the trigger!
[03:29:00.978 --> 03:29:01.598]  Point blank!
[03:29:02.678 --> 03:29:05.339]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[03:29:05.739 --> 03:29:10.880]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[03:29:11.540 --> 03:29:14.441]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[03:29:14.921 --> 03:29:18.425]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[03:29:19.046 --> 03:29:30.318]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[03:29:30.959 --> 03:29:41.708]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[03:29:42.008 --> 03:29:47.452]  You can support us by going to the InfoWar store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[03:29:47.773 --> 03:29:51.055]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.
[03:29:51.596 --> 03:29:53.037]  It's a 360 win.
[03:29:53.397 --> 03:29:56.520]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle,
[03:29:56.880 --> 03:29:58.682]  You're helping the fight for freedom.
[03:29:58.962 --> 03:30:00.303]  So please go to the site now.
[03:30:00.763 --> 03:30:02.345]  We need your support.
[03:30:06.807 --> 03:30:18.650]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[03:30:19.310 --> 03:30:28.612]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[03:30:28.832 --> 03:30:33.653]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[03:30:34.153 --> 03:30:39.215]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads.
[03:30:39.235 --> 03:30:43.457]  The cobwebs go away and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[03:30:44.318 --> 03:30:49.040]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up and the nutrition to wake them up.
[03:30:49.060 --> 03:30:50.580]  I mean, the brain is a physical organ.
[03:30:51.181 --> 03:30:57.484]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[03:30:57.524 --> 03:30:58.304]  Here's my problem.
[03:30:58.824 --> 03:31:07.272]  When I do take the bodies and the X2 and things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[03:31:07.652 --> 03:31:08.813]  I have the same issue.
[03:31:09.074 --> 03:31:09.254]  Yeah.
[03:31:09.874 --> 03:31:11.356]  Because then you're just like, ahh!
[03:31:12.176 --> 03:31:14.458]  But that's better than being in a coma.
[03:31:15.439 --> 03:31:20.463]  And they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[03:31:20.784 --> 03:31:22.885]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[03:31:22.905 --> 03:31:26.048]  And I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[03:31:26.228 --> 03:31:29.751]  It's 25% off, and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[03:31:30.051 --> 03:31:31.613]  We went out with the top labs.
[03:31:31.653 --> 03:31:32.534]  We want the strongest
[03:31:33.194 --> 03:31:40.499]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[03:31:40.519 --> 03:31:40.819]  This is key.
[03:31:40.839 --> 03:31:42.460]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem.
[03:31:58.471 --> 03:31:59.872]  And you have inflammation of the brain.
[03:31:59.932 --> 03:32:01.453]  They call that something down the road.
[03:32:01.493 --> 03:32:03.954]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[03:32:04.374 --> 03:32:05.975]  You have inflammation of the cells.
[03:32:06.015 --> 03:32:07.516]  They call that something else down the road.
[03:32:07.536 --> 03:32:12.959]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blaylock and other top brain surgeons on and they say, it's inflammation in the brain.
[03:32:13.319 --> 03:32:16.001]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[03:32:16.121 --> 03:32:16.801]  That's exactly right.
[03:32:17.181 --> 03:32:19.663]  Now, your product is an extract.
[03:32:20.083 --> 03:32:22.784]  And we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[03:32:23.024 --> 03:32:27.467]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[03:32:28.087 --> 03:32:31.270]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[03:32:31.290 --> 03:32:33.352]  The heavy metals stay in the root.
[03:32:33.672 --> 03:32:37.055]  So the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[03:32:37.095 --> 03:32:38.756]  Well, that's another reason.
[03:32:38.816 --> 03:32:45.802]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals test if you don't.
[03:32:45.942 --> 03:32:46.362]  Exactly.
[03:32:46.482 --> 03:32:53.387]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[03:32:53.707 --> 03:32:58.210]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[03:33:06.796 --> 03:33:09.398]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.223 --> 03:33:24.906]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[03:33:25.086 --> 03:33:31.588]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[03:33:33.909 --> 03:33:41.512]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:41.572 --> 03:33:42.573]  Coming down fast.
[03:33:44.594 --> 03:33:46.654]  But I'm miles above you, globalist!
[03:33:52.645 --> 03:33:54.566]  Maybe a lover, but you ain't no dancer.
[03:33:57.188 --> 03:33:58.429]  Hell to skelter, baby.
[03:33:58.449 --> 03:34:05.233]  These devil worshippers think they get power out of raping some little kid or cutting their heart out.
[03:34:05.913 --> 03:34:08.275]  You get power out of taking down devil worshippers.
[03:34:09.055 --> 03:34:09.756]  Real power.
[03:34:10.496 --> 03:34:12.918]  But once you get the real power, you don't even want the power anymore.
[03:34:13.278 --> 03:34:17.040]  You just don't want to be you, pedophile slime bags, and you know who you are.
[03:34:17.921 --> 03:34:18.862]  You're going down!
[03:34:20.015 --> 03:34:21.376]  Nothing on earth is going to stop that.
[03:34:21.877 --> 03:34:23.318]  And I don't just put a good face on things.
[03:34:23.338 --> 03:34:25.920]  People know I've been very negative going back 20 years ago about the position.
[03:34:25.960 --> 03:34:26.701]  People didn't wake up.
[03:34:27.182 --> 03:34:30.164]  But we've turned the tide on the deep state being exposed, the economy coming back.
[03:34:30.384 --> 03:34:35.089]  And I wanted to say this and hand the baton to Roger Stone, who's been taking care of his wife, who's been in and out of the hospital.
[03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:36.130]  You should pray for her.
[03:34:37.364 --> 03:34:38.725]  And who I've told, don't do the war room today.
[03:34:38.745 --> 03:34:39.405]  Owen Schroeder is doing it.
[03:34:39.425 --> 03:34:40.246]  I want him to get some rest.
[03:34:40.286 --> 03:34:41.686]  I could tell his voice is almost gone.
[03:34:42.547 --> 03:34:47.009]  People ask, I had Ron Paul on earlier, and he's like, well, I think Trump's done a lot of good on these things, but bad on these.
[03:34:47.049 --> 03:34:48.890]  And I don't know why they hate him so much, though.
[03:34:49.570 --> 03:34:55.753]  Because Trump's returning power back to the executive branch and back to the country, where we are about America, which is good for the whole world.
[03:34:55.894 --> 03:34:57.194]  Globalism is bad for the world.
[03:34:57.794 --> 03:34:59.055]  And it's the return of the country.
[03:34:59.355 --> 03:35:04.098]  And you can see things turning around very, very quickly, like driving out of a thunderstorm into a beautiful spring day.
[03:35:04.878 --> 03:35:07.921]  It's dusk, you know, to dawn situation.
[03:35:07.961 --> 03:35:08.922]  The sun is coming up.
[03:35:09.443 --> 03:35:11.044]  Because Trump isn't out to get the country.
[03:35:11.064 --> 03:35:13.406]  And that's why I trust the President.
[03:35:13.526 --> 03:35:15.248]  I metaphysically, at a gut level, know it.
[03:35:15.328 --> 03:35:15.869]  I've seen it.
[03:35:16.389 --> 03:35:18.031]  He's gonna make some zigs, some zags.
[03:35:18.071 --> 03:35:18.932]  He's not a dictator.
[03:35:18.992 --> 03:35:19.933]  He can't do it all.
[03:35:21.277 --> 03:35:25.361]  He's going to weigh, as a captain, taking us out of this situation.
[03:35:25.381 --> 03:35:29.745]  I think there's going to be some pawn sacrifice in that whole situation.
[03:35:29.785 --> 03:35:36.951]  I think Trump sees himself as a pawn in the final equation to America and his family and not letting these dirtbags have full control.
[03:35:37.011 --> 03:35:38.593]  So I want you to pray for President Trump.
[03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:40.750]  I want you to pray for your family.
[03:35:40.770 --> 03:35:41.691]  I want you to pray for us.
[03:35:42.051 --> 03:35:45.072]  There's a lot of people I've known who weren't even Christian or were atheistic.
[03:35:45.352 --> 03:35:46.112]  They found God.
[03:35:46.412 --> 03:35:47.252]  Not in these churches.
[03:35:48.933 --> 03:35:50.213]  These devils with crucifix.
[03:35:50.633 --> 03:35:56.695]  But just that metaphysically this is a good versus evil situation.
[03:35:57.255 --> 03:36:01.436]  It's not a mistake that Saul Alinsky pledged himself to Lucifer in his book and that these people follow this.
[03:36:02.357 --> 03:36:06.178]  They have an operating system that I would describe as devil worship.
[03:36:06.989 --> 03:36:12.413]  And notice they sold their whole revolution as all free sex and all this fun, but once they got control, they go, oh, no sex!
[03:36:12.793 --> 03:36:16.035]  And no men and no women and no God, no country and no property.
[03:36:16.055 --> 03:36:19.758]  And Bloomberg's saying, you know, it's good for poor people to have higher taxes.
[03:36:20.558 --> 03:36:21.639]  That's how you destroy poor people.
[03:36:21.899 --> 03:36:22.900]  Poor people shouldn't pay taxes.
[03:36:24.594 --> 03:36:29.038]  And he pays almost no taxes, the way he's got his stuff written, like the other big companies.
[03:36:29.118 --> 03:36:30.319]  It's so evil!
[03:36:31.020 --> 03:36:36.965]  And these people are so bad, and they're always telling you how good they are, when they're conscious psychopaths.
[03:36:37.465 --> 03:36:45.452]  And there are just those of us out there, who know what they're doing, and who aren't going to be intimidated, and who aren't going to roll over to their garbage.
[03:36:46.453 --> 03:36:48.034]  So, the swamp is being drained.
[03:36:48.925 --> 03:36:50.326]  And a lot of this is happening, you know.
[03:36:50.346 --> 03:36:59.511]  They've got the new CIA director that's a woman, a nice novel thing, and they made the point, well, the Brennan people ordered her to carry out the torture, or things like that.
[03:37:00.071 --> 03:37:01.912]  Why then should she not be able to get the job?
[03:37:02.332 --> 03:37:03.373]  And that's the whole debate.
[03:37:04.609 --> 03:37:06.730]  And, oh, she'll get tough on people, Mr. President.
[03:37:06.770 --> 03:37:10.672]  Did she flip against Brennan?
[03:37:11.893 --> 03:37:13.534]  Or is she the next mole?
[03:37:13.694 --> 03:37:21.998]  Is she the next big crisis where we get Pompeo, who's a patriot and done pretty good for the country, over into Secretary of State to actually execute things?
[03:37:22.398 --> 03:37:25.960]  You got Haspel, who's this Brennan acolyte, basically.
[03:37:26.641 --> 03:37:28.402]  We're going to get, again, Roger's take on that.
[03:37:28.782 --> 03:37:32.144]  So did we get, you know, one good guy in and then a bad lady in?
[03:37:33.103 --> 03:37:37.287]  And is it just like the repeat of bringing Bolton in?
[03:37:37.347 --> 03:37:40.431]  I mean, you know, Roger's known Bolton for years, played poker with him, says he's a nice guy.
[03:37:40.451 --> 03:37:45.376]  It's kind of like Albert Speer said, you know, you don't know the devil when he's got his arm around your shoulder.
[03:37:45.396 --> 03:37:46.196]  Talking about Hitler.
[03:37:47.658 --> 03:37:49.540]  He's openly trying to sabotage the peace deal.
[03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:53.224]  And if Trump gets that, that's just the icing on the cake.
[03:37:55.393 --> 03:37:56.954]  That's what's happening here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:56.994 --> 03:37:59.855]  So he's going to give you his breakdown on that in just a moment.
[03:37:59.895 --> 03:38:02.097]  But that's why I support President Trump.
[03:38:02.157 --> 03:38:07.880]  And like Roger said during the break, he said despite all these people against him, he just keeps coming through and delivering.
[03:38:07.920 --> 03:38:09.240]  So this is an epic time to be alive.
[03:38:09.501 --> 03:38:09.981]  Roger Stone?
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:12.921]  Well Alex, I agree with you.
[03:38:12.981 --> 03:38:27.212]  I really think the President's great strength is the job he's been doing on domestic policy, 4% economic growth, cutting restrictive regulations that kill jobs, appointing conservatives to the judiciary
[03:38:27.572 --> 03:38:30.335]  At all levels, including the U.S.
[03:38:30.756 --> 03:38:31.497]  Supreme Court.
[03:38:31.917 --> 03:38:41.749]  Where I'm concerned is the efforts by the deep state, the neocons, the war hawks, that the president has surrounded himself, John Bolton included.
[03:38:41.869 --> 03:38:45.553]  I think Bolton is an extraordinary, able guy, and that's what scares me.
[03:38:46.314 --> 03:39:11.669]  Because if it's not Donald Trump's agenda of anti-interventionism, if it's the continued foreign policy adventurism of the deep state in Syria, in Afghanistan, if they're going to try to secretly wreck the North Korea deal, the fact that Trump stood up to these deep state quizlings and cashiered the Iranian deal is an enormous testimony to his fortitude.
[03:39:12.449 --> 03:39:21.416]  Pompeo rose because, although I still think he is of the neocon camp, sadly, once praised Assange, now says he's a criminal.
[03:39:22.298 --> 03:39:22.839]  Puzzling.
[03:39:23.499 --> 03:39:25.601]  But Pompeo was against the Iran deal.
[03:39:25.641 --> 03:39:28.544]  This is why he was elevated here.
[03:39:29.425 --> 03:39:31.627]  And he has served in that capacity.
[03:39:32.087 --> 03:39:35.230]  But I really am very concerned about Gina Haspel.
[03:39:35.770 --> 03:39:44.979]  I believe, and my sources tell me, that she was the link between the government communications headquarters, the so-called GCHQ.
[03:39:45.379 --> 03:39:48.062]  That's a part of British intelligence.
[03:39:48.602 --> 03:39:55.606]  That she was Brennan's link to their involvement in the entire phony dossier.
[03:39:55.646 --> 03:39:58.148]  And by the way, just as Napolitano said, that's how it's done.
[03:39:58.168 --> 03:40:03.671]  When you do illegal spying or even murders, you use another government to kill your people or spy on them.
[03:40:03.951 --> 03:40:06.112]  That way you have dirt on each other and you're both corrupted.
[03:40:06.152 --> 03:40:07.333]  That's standard.
[03:40:07.713 --> 03:40:10.575]  When they spy on someone illegally, it is the British that do it.
[03:40:10.895 --> 03:40:18.099]  And because I'm informed and Napolitano's informed, they act like we're dumb and go, oh, they don't know about the relationship because some late night comic said so.
[03:40:18.379 --> 03:40:20.261]  Well, don't they have egg on their face now, Roger?
[03:40:20.281 --> 03:40:21.922]  No, you're absolutely right.
[03:40:22.243 --> 03:40:31.651]  See, they basically do favors for each other because it gives the US government deniability and the Brits do their dirty work for them.
[03:40:32.131 --> 03:40:34.554]  When Lyndon Johnson was president,
[03:40:35.474 --> 03:40:40.599]  They wanted to surveil former Vice President Richard Nixon when he was in Hong Kong.
[03:40:40.639 --> 03:40:41.821]  But rather than have U.S.
[03:40:41.861 --> 03:40:52.091]  intelligence did it, they went to the British intelligence services and the British M1 found Nixon in a hotel room with a Chinese hooker.
[03:40:52.731 --> 03:40:52.991]  I don't
[03:41:12.839 --> 03:41:19.221]  For torture, which he thinks makes Gina look tough, I think he has put a deep state quizling in control.
[03:41:19.301 --> 03:41:21.901]  John Brennan's wholly owned subsidiary.
[03:41:21.941 --> 03:41:22.902]  This scares me.
[03:41:23.262 --> 03:41:30.104]  Now hopefully, Alex, I'm wrong and she's flipped, but we hope that Bolton might... Remember if you go back and look what I said when he was appointed.
[03:41:30.164 --> 03:41:31.004]  We hope he's flipped.
[03:41:31.804 --> 03:41:32.484]  And he hasn't.
[03:41:32.544 --> 03:41:35.146]  He clearly... I don't like where he is headed.
[03:41:35.646 --> 03:41:36.887]  And I don't like the co-option.
[03:41:36.907 --> 03:41:39.228]  Well, when he says all this, I've watched the videos closely.
[03:41:39.268 --> 03:41:43.610]  He's like a tack dog delivering the snapping bites for a master.
[03:41:44.090 --> 03:41:47.932]  And then, I mean, you can see him just sabotaging the president.
[03:41:47.952 --> 03:41:49.273]  I think he needs to be thrown out on his ass.
[03:41:50.489 --> 03:41:52.350]  Well, I'd hoped he'd be an improvement over H.R.
[03:41:52.410 --> 03:41:53.090]  McMaster.
[03:41:53.290 --> 03:41:53.891]  He's not.
[03:41:54.731 --> 03:41:59.993]  The president continues to surround himself, particularly in the foreign policy realm, with deep state quizzers.
[03:42:00.014 --> 03:42:01.114]  Well, that's what Ron Paul said.
[03:42:01.134 --> 03:42:04.215]  He said, I like Trump in a lot of ways, but he's just these people.
[03:42:06.647 --> 03:42:15.691]  No, I actually think, I think Rand Paul, if I had to tell you where my politics were right now, and what national political figure kind of reflects my views, it would be Rand Paul.
[03:42:16.431 --> 03:42:19.472]  I support the president when he's right, and he's right about a lot.
[03:42:19.792 --> 03:42:21.513]  And he takes on the establishment on a lot.
[03:42:21.533 --> 03:42:26.695]  And he's got the star appeal for the world stage, and I don't think Rand Paul could deliver like Trump's done.
[03:42:26.775 --> 03:42:33.218]  But Rand Paul is, when it comes to real policy, he's super nuanced and he's unbelievable.
[03:42:33.618 --> 03:42:40.601]  Well, and more importantly, Rand Paul's an effective critic of the Trump foreign policy when the Warhawks and the neocons get control of the wheel.
[03:42:40.621 --> 03:42:43.342]  And the left is so dumb, or maybe not, they're always attacking him.
[03:42:44.383 --> 03:42:45.323]  They're such idiots.
[03:42:45.383 --> 03:42:47.724]  Well, actually, they're not, though, because they're all pro-war.
[03:42:48.144 --> 03:42:50.325]  Roger Stone's taking over the final segment in the War Room.
[03:42:50.585 --> 03:42:51.285]  Please support us.
[03:42:51.305 --> 03:42:52.326]  The enemy's coming after us.
[03:42:52.366 --> 03:42:53.206]  It's a battle of wills.
[03:42:53.546 --> 03:42:54.747]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:42:54.887 --> 03:42:56.167]  Oh, I got one more thing to say when we come back.
[03:42:58.648 --> 03:42:59.649]  I'm doing a press conference today.
[03:43:04.028 --> 03:43:22.317]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:22.418 --> 03:43:27.740]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:27.880 --> 03:43:29.381]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:29.501 --> 03:43:32.663]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:33.303 --> 03:43:34.264]  And so much more.
[03:43:34.824 --> 03:43:35.985]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.205 --> 03:43:37.907]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:37.927 --> 03:43:43.631]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:43.731 --> 03:43:44.932]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:44.952 --> 03:43:46.874]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:46.954 --> 03:43:49.356]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:49.556 --> 03:43:50.817]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:50.997 --> 03:43:52.798]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:53.359 --> 03:43:53.959]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:54.080 --> 03:43:55.401]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:55.501 --> 03:43:56.682]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:02.023 --> 03:44:08.928]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[03:44:09.189 --> 03:44:18.916]  This is without question the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken, and it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[03:44:18.976 --> 03:44:21.979]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[03:44:22.199 --> 03:44:23.420]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[03:44:23.860 --> 03:44:27.223]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now.
[03:44:27.603 --> 03:44:31.255]  And get your Brainforce Plus at Infowarslife.com
[03:44:32.779 --> 03:44:33.520]  I'm so excited.
[03:44:33.600 --> 03:44:43.146]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:44:43.746 --> 03:44:48.930]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:44:49.230 --> 03:44:52.052]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:44:52.252 --> 03:45:01.018]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:45:03.119 --> 03:45:07.920]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:45:08.420 --> 03:45:11.201]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:45:11.341 --> 03:45:22.224]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:45:22.724 --> 03:45:24.004]  It is amazing!
[03:45:25.405 --> 03:45:30.366]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:45:35.086 --> 03:45:36.947]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[03:45:36.967 --> 03:45:37.268]  Go ahead.
[03:45:37.368 --> 03:45:41.251]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[03:45:41.391 --> 03:45:46.415]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[03:45:46.955 --> 03:45:52.499]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[03:45:53.340 --> 03:46:01.605]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[03:46:02.265 --> 03:46:05.147]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[03:46:05.827 --> 03:46:09.470]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[03:46:09.570 --> 03:46:16.374]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[03:46:17.034 --> 03:46:24.861]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats, how they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[03:46:24.881 --> 03:46:29.865]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[03:46:30.365 --> 03:46:40.533]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water, my mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do!
[03:46:41.394 --> 03:46:42.695]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[03:46:42.875 --> 03:46:48.197]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[03:46:48.217 --> 03:46:49.577]  I think you should just share her testimony.
[03:46:49.597 --> 03:46:49.717]  Yeah.
[03:46:49.897 --> 03:46:51.758]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[03:46:51.818 --> 03:46:52.658]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[03:46:52.678 --> 03:46:54.359]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[03:46:54.379 --> 03:46:55.359]  We really appreciate you.
[03:46:55.739 --> 03:46:56.420]  Keep up the fight.
[03:46:56.440 --> 03:46:57.860]  We need to take California back.
[03:46:57.880 --> 03:46:58.260]  Thank you, Desiree.
[03:46:58.280 --> 03:46:59.361]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[03:46:59.401 --> 03:47:00.021]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[03:47:06.203 --> 03:47:08.824]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.833 --> 03:47:25.735]  Well, I won't back down.
[03:47:27.056 --> 03:47:29.839]  No, I won't back down.
[03:47:31.260 --> 03:47:38.325]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[03:47:39.701 --> 03:47:41.202]  I know what's right.
[03:47:41.222 --> 03:47:42.963]  I got just one life.
[03:47:43.063 --> 03:47:44.624]  There ain't no easy way out.
[03:48:13.925 --> 03:48:22.213]  See, you won't back down.
[03:48:22.673 --> 03:48:25.095]  They're starting it, they're pushing it, and they're losing on every front.
[03:48:26.076 --> 03:48:28.599]  But it doesn't mean the tip of the spear isn't ramming right into them.
[03:48:28.699 --> 03:48:29.560]  We're winning.
[03:48:33.648 --> 03:48:38.731]  And they just think you're going to give up because you hear about it so much.
[03:48:38.791 --> 03:48:40.112]  Another lawsuit, another attack.
[03:48:40.132 --> 03:48:41.373]  The perception we're losing.
[03:48:42.494 --> 03:48:43.055]  We're winning.
[03:48:43.095 --> 03:48:44.816]  The things they're saying about us aren't true.
[03:48:44.856 --> 03:48:45.376]  They're desperate.
[03:48:45.396 --> 03:48:45.937]  They're frauds.
[03:48:46.017 --> 03:48:48.439]  But you've got to understand that
[03:48:49.306 --> 03:48:53.548]  Most other conservatives and people, when they start getting shadowbanned on Twitter and YouTube, they suddenly roll over.
[03:48:53.808 --> 03:48:57.009]  And the litmus test is to attack Alex Jones, to attack Roger Stone.
[03:48:57.629 --> 03:48:59.690]  Behind the scenes, I think I'm going to get him to talk about it publicly.
[03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:02.651]  Ted Nugent talked about this stuff.
[03:49:03.712 --> 03:49:06.213]  They want him off the NRA board because it's Ted Nugent.
[03:49:06.513 --> 03:49:07.273]  Turn the NRA around.
[03:49:07.373 --> 03:49:08.234]  I know the inside baseball.
[03:49:08.294 --> 03:49:09.994]  It's him, along with Gunners of America.
[03:49:11.075 --> 03:49:12.215]  And there's these key players.
[03:49:13.176 --> 03:49:15.497]  You know, Ted Nugent during the campaign probably did 5,000 interviews.
[03:49:17.659 --> 03:49:20.380]  The guy is a dynamo at 70 years old.
[03:49:21.240 --> 03:49:25.841]  I mean, in person, he's not like a guy trying to act powerful and intimidating.
[03:49:25.861 --> 03:49:29.142]  You just feel like a caveman's in the room, but a smart one.
[03:49:29.742 --> 03:49:32.003]  And it's the same with Roger Stone or myself or anybody.
[03:49:32.043 --> 03:49:34.463]  We absolutely appreciate you.
[03:49:34.963 --> 03:49:37.304]  And without you, though, we're going to be destroyed.
[03:49:38.257 --> 03:49:41.118]  And the good news is the globalists have been bloody really bad.
[03:49:41.379 --> 03:49:42.299]  And we're winning right now.
[03:49:42.699 --> 03:49:46.461]  I'm just telling you, people, it's a battle of wills, Roger, isn't it?
[03:49:46.501 --> 03:49:47.562]  It's a total battle of wills.
[03:49:48.302 --> 03:49:49.282]  Well, it is.
[03:49:49.382 --> 03:49:55.425]  And look, there's no experience like having a runaway federal prosecutor poking into every molecule of your very being.
[03:49:55.886 --> 03:49:59.347]  Scooping 80 of your friends up, grabbing all your emails, finding nothing.
[03:49:59.848 --> 03:50:00.088]  Right.
[03:50:00.428 --> 03:50:04.590]  And badgering numerous associates, current and former.
[03:50:04.610 --> 03:50:05.590]  What about Alex Jones?
[03:50:07.231 --> 03:50:08.332]  What about Alex Jones?
[03:50:08.892 --> 03:50:10.633]  What's Stone's relationship with Alex Jones?
[03:50:10.653 --> 03:50:12.234]  What do Stone and Jones talk about?
[03:50:12.554 --> 03:50:13.654]  Do they talk on the phone?
[03:50:13.694 --> 03:50:14.815]  Do they talk on Signal?
[03:50:15.235 --> 03:50:16.636]  Do they talk on WhatsApp?
[03:50:16.916 --> 03:50:18.137]  How often do they talk?
[03:50:18.797 --> 03:50:20.618]  What are their business arrangements?
[03:50:21.278 --> 03:50:22.579]  Why do they want to know these things?
[03:50:22.719 --> 03:50:24.300]  Alex, you're in their crosshairs!
[03:50:25.100 --> 03:50:26.221]  I'm in their crosshairs.
[03:50:26.581 --> 03:50:27.001]  Why?
[03:50:27.882 --> 03:50:28.843]  There you have it.
[03:50:29.063 --> 03:50:33.466]  I mean, we have these trucks surveilling our house.
[03:50:34.526 --> 03:50:39.970]  The longtime telephone number, a hardline number, I've had for the last eight years.
[03:50:40.410 --> 03:50:41.791]  I pick up the phone, it's dead.
[03:50:42.451 --> 03:50:45.373]  I contact the phone company, they said that number was disconnected.
[03:50:45.974 --> 03:50:47.335]  I said, well, can you reconnect it?
[03:50:47.375 --> 03:50:48.896]  They said, no, we'll give you a new number.
[03:50:49.856 --> 03:50:50.237]  Really?
[03:50:50.257 --> 03:50:52.018]  A new number?
[03:50:53.012 --> 03:50:53.272]  Huh.
[03:50:54.012 --> 03:50:57.374]  I only use it for radio interviews on a hard wire, in all honesty.
[03:50:58.074 --> 03:51:05.957]  But knowing that the government is in your email, in your text messages, in your, presumably, my tax return... Imagine!
[03:51:05.977 --> 03:51:08.318]  They're literally looking up our rear ends every day.
[03:51:09.835 --> 03:51:17.422]  Alex, they're trying to find the paid, you know, the cancelled checks on all those Russian bots that were promoting InfoWars.
[03:51:17.983 --> 03:51:22.307]  And then you go to some of these internet sources like QAnon.
[03:51:22.567 --> 03:51:25.089]  Oh, Alex Jones is controlled opposition.
[03:51:25.470 --> 03:51:28.753]  Roger Stone's a long time CIA operative.
[03:51:29.213 --> 03:51:30.374]  This is insanity.
[03:51:30.634 --> 03:51:32.154]  This is craziness.
[03:51:32.534 --> 03:51:34.755]  But that's where they're trying to destabilize.
[03:51:34.815 --> 03:51:36.796]  Obviously, we're bringing the country back.
[03:51:36.996 --> 03:51:38.137]  Soros is attacking us.
[03:51:38.417 --> 03:51:39.377]  We're the tip of the spear.
[03:51:39.457 --> 03:51:40.598]  We are your champions.
[03:51:40.638 --> 03:51:42.579]  And I'm not saying that on a power trip.
[03:51:42.599 --> 03:51:45.580]  It's like, I'm kind of looking around in history at 44.
[03:51:45.620 --> 03:51:49.982]  And I mean, we are in the middle of destiny right now with the listeners and the audience.
[03:51:50.022 --> 03:51:51.122]  And it's the audience they hate.
[03:51:51.442 --> 03:51:53.323]  They want to cut us off from these great people, Roger.
[03:51:54.312 --> 03:52:07.720]  Well, look, I hope the president is watching Dr. Jerry Corsi's Twitter feed, because he's laying out in great details the vulnerabilities of the Deep State, Clapper, Brennan, Rice, their UN ambassador.
[03:52:08.340 --> 03:52:12.842]  These people are epically corrupt, and we haven't even gotten to the unmasking yet.
[03:52:13.263 --> 03:52:16.384]  Devin Nunes is beating back an extraordinary cover-up.
[03:52:16.865 --> 03:52:21.467]  The idea that Rod Rosenstein... Boy, imagine how much Nunes is getting targeted.
[03:52:21.507 --> 03:52:22.468]  He's a real champion too.
[03:52:23.448 --> 03:52:26.029]  Oh, well he's not a lawyer, Alex, he's just a farmer.
[03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:27.789]  Yeah, well he's an honest farmer.
[03:52:28.049 --> 03:52:40.232]  And the men who founded this country, they were accountants, and they were bookkeepers, and they were farmers, and they were lawyers, and they were blacksmiths, and they were shoe cobblers.
[03:52:41.072 --> 03:52:45.713]  This denigrating him as a non-elite because he's not a lawyer, what difference does that make?
[03:52:45.753 --> 03:52:47.033]  He's a man of enormous courage.
[03:52:47.053 --> 03:52:49.114]  He knows right from wrong, and he's kicking their ass.
[03:52:50.094 --> 03:53:01.764]  Well, and the idea that Rosenstein and Sessions refused to hand over to Congress a co-equal branch of government... I was about to say, what, at this point, how does Sessions not... Sedition!
[03:53:02.244 --> 03:53:04.045]  It's sedition is what this is.
[03:53:04.105 --> 03:53:08.869]  It's a cover-up that makes Watergate look like, well, a second-rate burglary.
[03:53:09.069 --> 03:53:10.010]  I'm going to finish with this.
[03:53:10.471 --> 03:53:11.211]  This is what happened.
[03:53:11.972 --> 03:53:15.515]  And I never even knew Napolitano did this on one of his own little internet feeds for Fox.
[03:53:15.535 --> 03:53:16.656]  It wasn't on Fox News.
[03:53:17.796 --> 03:53:19.017]  Dew was showing this from last year.
[03:53:20.111 --> 03:53:20.871]  I'm going to play it tomorrow.
[03:53:21.131 --> 03:53:22.632]  I'm going to play it today.
[03:53:22.652 --> 03:53:38.657]  Teresa Paltano, who's got his ear to the ground in more ways than one, really smart guy, obviously, he said, they blew the cover of all these spies, they did Benghazi, they did all this, they're selling America out to foreign interests, and that's why the patriots in the government have turned against them.
[03:53:38.677 --> 03:53:40.277]  We have a real civil war in the deep state.
[03:53:40.637 --> 03:53:48.920]  Well, that's what this is, is the Office of Personal Management, 21 plus million names, was given to the Chinese to compromise the whole U.S.
[03:53:49.500 --> 03:53:50.781]  It's beyond a shotgun wedding.
[03:53:50.841 --> 03:53:56.204]  We have already basically been compromised so bad, we're shot up basically with shotgun holes.
[03:53:56.664 --> 03:54:04.208]  But the country's crawling back, getting strong, we're pumping blood back in it, and you know, Ron Paul's like, well, it's kind of inflationary.
[03:54:04.768 --> 03:54:08.650]  Yeah, if somebody's dying, you'll jam a needle with adrenaline in their damn heart, you bet.
[03:54:08.971 --> 03:54:11.492]  And Trump's got us up, fighting for our lives right now.
[03:54:11.792 --> 03:54:13.253]  We've actually knocked the enemy down.
[03:54:13.273 --> 03:54:16.715]  If we just start stomping their head in politically, we're gonna win!
[03:54:17.395 --> 03:54:19.277]  Then we can get on the stretcher and get back to health.
[03:54:19.337 --> 03:54:20.699]  We are messed up, man!
[03:54:21.019 --> 03:54:21.800]  We are bloody!
[03:54:22.461 --> 03:54:29.609]  And from the individual right up to the country itself, and this beautiful thing, compared to everything else in the world, they hate it because it had the idea of freedom.
[03:54:29.649 --> 03:54:31.631]  And I am part of the cult of America.
[03:54:31.871 --> 03:54:32.452]  Americana.
[03:54:32.552 --> 03:54:33.012]  I love it.
[03:54:33.193 --> 03:54:34.094]  I'm 100% about it.
[03:54:34.274 --> 03:54:38.959]  And these globalists are the traitors that hate this country, and they hate you, and they hate your family, and they hate...
[03:54:39.119 --> 03:54:45.726]  Every single one of us, they're a bunch of scum, and they're the eugenicists, and they're the Nazi supporters, and they're the racists, and they're your enemies!
[03:54:46.006 --> 03:54:53.674]  And it's time to just throw off the bonds, wake up and realize it, and it's a spiritual thing, it's energy, and I'm telling you, I felt it two days ago.
[03:54:54.451 --> 03:55:01.736]  About a day and a half ago, I felt everything shift, and I've seen it in the President's demeanor and his attacks, and when he's walking to get on the helicopter, like he's winning.
[03:55:02.076 --> 03:55:09.822]  I mean, I've never seen Trump looking so happy just in his body language, but I already said it yesterday, I spiritually feel like we've hit the next level.
[03:55:10.162 --> 03:55:13.264]  So of course the enemy's gonna hit us a lot harder, but they've lost it.
[03:55:13.324 --> 03:55:17.187]  They have spiritually had their will broken, Roger.
[03:55:17.207 --> 03:55:17.608]  What do you think?
[03:55:18.388 --> 03:55:19.910]  Donald Trump is a counter-puncher.
[03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:28.197]  You can say anything you want about Giuliani, and right now the left, the people who hate you and I, Alex, have launched a massive whisper campaign.
[03:55:28.578 --> 03:55:30.319]  Giuliani has a drinking problem.
[03:55:30.860 --> 03:55:32.982]  Giuliani is mentally incompetent.
[03:55:33.442 --> 03:55:43.370]  If they hate him, that's the reason why we have to look at the fact that he's got his president off of defense and on offense and he's kicking Mueller's ass in the media every day.
[03:55:44.111 --> 03:55:45.312]  So I give him credit.
[03:55:45.952 --> 03:55:56.961]  They want to blow him out of there because Trump is now swinging for the rafters and he's hitting and he's hitting hard and he's doing it because of the solid advice of a wartime conciliary.
[03:55:57.361 --> 03:55:58.683]  Rudy Giuliani.
[03:55:58.723 --> 03:56:01.767]  Before he had peacetime conciliaries.
[03:56:01.868 --> 03:56:04.551]  He had legal pussies working for him.
[03:56:04.671 --> 03:56:05.252]  Cowards!
[03:56:05.633 --> 03:56:10.460]  Who thought that Mueller could be relied on for his affability, his impartiality.
[03:56:10.800 --> 03:56:12.843]  Now he's got a fighter, a bruiser.
[03:56:13.003 --> 03:56:13.384]  That's right.
[03:56:13.604 --> 03:56:14.585]  We are in a war.
[03:56:14.785 --> 03:56:16.426]  Doesn't mean all the people Trump's got are perfect.
[03:56:16.686 --> 03:56:18.308]  But a lot of them are flipping to the Republic.
[03:56:18.328 --> 03:56:19.228]  They've made the decision.
[03:56:19.268 --> 03:56:20.109]  You sign on to Trump.
[03:56:20.369 --> 03:56:22.050]  You sign on to America and it coming back.
[03:56:22.290 --> 03:56:22.951]  It's that simple.
[03:56:23.251 --> 03:56:24.672]  Sign on the dotted line spiritually.
[03:56:24.852 --> 03:56:25.753]  We're for America.
[03:56:25.913 --> 03:56:26.674]  We're for freedom.
[03:56:26.874 --> 03:56:27.714]  We're for free speech.
[03:56:27.955 --> 03:56:28.915]  We're for the Second Amendment.
[03:56:29.055 --> 03:56:35.720]  We're against George Soros and Hillary and Hollywood and all the scum and the chi-coms and the pedophile Pope and all of it.
[03:56:35.900 --> 03:56:38.843]  My God, they're handing out condoms to Boy Scouts at age seven.
[03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:41.050]  I mean, it's next level.
[03:56:41.070 --> 03:56:43.091]  These people are coming for everything!
[03:56:43.311 --> 03:56:44.952]  And they think they've got us broken?
[03:56:45.392 --> 03:56:45.732]  No!
[03:56:46.152 --> 03:56:47.272]  We break them!
[03:56:47.673 --> 03:56:48.593]  That's how this works.
[03:56:48.913 --> 03:56:50.193]  It's total domination.
[03:56:50.594 --> 03:56:56.315]  They want to enslave the place known for having the strong, upright people that couldn't be enslaved.
[03:56:56.575 --> 03:56:58.196]  They're coming for us to enslave us.
[03:56:58.456 --> 03:56:59.216]  It's spiritual.
[03:56:59.456 --> 03:57:00.737]  They want to mount our head on the wall.
[03:57:01.337 --> 03:57:03.059]  They want to count coup on us.
[03:57:03.180 --> 03:57:04.501]  It will not happen.
[03:57:04.581 --> 03:57:06.324]  This is the animating contest.
[03:57:06.384 --> 03:57:14.234]  All you men that have money and all this but aren't happy because your cigarette boat isn't bigger than the other guys, you would be fulfilled if you acted like men.
[03:57:14.515 --> 03:57:18.580]  If you were men and stood up for something and weren't a bunch of damn cowards!
[03:57:19.642 --> 03:57:20.802]  God, you people are dead!
[03:57:20.822 --> 03:57:21.823]  And I'm not talking to our audience.
[03:57:21.863 --> 03:57:26.204]  I'm talking to the men out there that think they're tough and sit on their butts all day and don't do anything.
[03:57:26.224 --> 03:57:29.465]  But I tell you, our affiliates and TV stations are exploding.
[03:57:29.605 --> 03:57:32.466]  There are a lot of men out there and women, and they get where this is.
[03:57:32.747 --> 03:57:33.427]  Roger, get some rest.
[03:57:33.447 --> 03:57:34.227]  You're doing a great job.
[03:57:34.827 --> 03:57:35.447]  Pray for your wife.
[03:57:35.467 --> 03:57:36.988]  I know she's sick again.
[03:57:37.028 --> 03:57:37.528]  God bless you.
[03:57:38.228 --> 03:57:39.269]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:57:40.349 --> 03:57:49.494]  The War Room starts in two minutes, and I'm gonna be live with a press conference on air about the latest Soros attacks and the latest Sandy Hook BS lawsuit.
[03:57:49.534 --> 03:57:50.754]  Transmissions continue!

[03:58:09.748 --> 03:58:12.869]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[03:58:13.109 --> 03:58:22.431]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin, and it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[03:58:22.591 --> 03:58:24.952]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[03:58:25.172 --> 03:58:26.872]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[03:58:27.072 --> 03:58:29.713]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[03:58:29.973 --> 03:58:34.494]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[03:58:34.814 --> 03:58:40.916]  Alpha power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[03:58:41.336 --> 03:58:45.837]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[03:58:46.337 --> 03:58:47.478]  That helps with focus, too.
[03:58:47.918 --> 03:58:48.858]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[03:58:49.378 --> 03:58:53.505]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products and they're always of supreme quality.
[03:58:53.925 --> 03:58:57.972]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking alpha power.
[03:58:58.252 --> 03:58:59.755]  There's definitely been a change.
