[00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.050]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.351]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.991]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.212]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:22.613]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:27.595]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:33.658]  It's Thursday, August 2nd.
[00:00:35.662 --> 00:00:36.983]  2018, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:42.064]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours in the War Room with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.406]  I need to make this announcement.
[00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.128]  And I need to have it really, really sink in.
[00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.871]  It is not hyperbole.
[00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:02.872]  It is not hype.
[00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.759]  It is not exaggeration.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:32.824]  It is a historic, completely documented fact, and it is the most important issue to everyone on this planet, that the Council on Foreign Relations' China Century Plan be exposed.
[00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:55.205]  China has a leveraged, controlling interest in money, in manpower, in infrastructure, and in traders in our government and in corporations to control this nation.
[00:01:55.645 --> 00:02:02.809]  China is in control of everything in America but the military,
[00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:09.857]  Some of the courts and the states.
[00:02:11.258 --> 00:02:12.418]  It is a fact.
[00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:17.399]  And I've been pointing this out and others like Tucker Carlson are starting to do it.
[00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.179]  So is the president.
[00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:30.222]  But I'm going to tell you things that the president can't tell you at his level or it would have some very, very dangerous consequences.
[00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:36.783]  But I think the consequences of the president not doing this and not saying this are too great.
[00:02:39.088 --> 00:02:47.691]  And the main reason they want to destroy me out of all of it is that no one else is putting out the real globalist agenda.
[00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.651]  I want to explain something.
[00:02:49.892 --> 00:03:05.877]  This is a wedding between the big megabanks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, the EU, the whole Hollywood combine that the Rockefellers set up and wrote books about.
[00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.850]  And editorials in the New York Times.
[00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:21.497]  The traitors needed a big industrial power, and they needed a focused, autocratic, fascist system that they call communist, that they could interface with.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.203]  China, in its official military doctrine, says they are in economic war with us,
[00:03:34.221 --> 00:03:42.705]  They're dismantling us, from without and from within, and they've had Davos meetings last year, not this year, where the Chinese dictator came.
[00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:44.226]  They've made him officially a dictator now.
[00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:48.128]  He was always selected by the party, but now he is.
[00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:50.829]  They made him dictator for life, along with his vice president.
[00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.510]  That hasn't happened since Mao.
[00:03:57.532 --> 00:03:59.133]  Because they're in a war posture.
[00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:02.615]  So we are at war with China.
[00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:16.925]  And it shakes me to my core how brainwashed many of our fellow countrymen and women are and how they believe globalist propaganda and that even Fox News is viciously attacking me and lying about me but never showing what I really supposedly said.
[00:04:17.306 --> 00:04:19.708]  Trying to juxtapose me against families and children.
[00:04:20.088 --> 00:04:21.349]  Classic globalist tactic.
[00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.492]  When China is selling political dissidents organs.
[00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:28.015]  When China has taken over the major universities.
[00:04:28.095 --> 00:04:28.716]  Everything here.
[00:04:31.894 --> 00:04:47.261]  And they are implementing the censorship, and I told you Google is moving to China, and their own leaked documents don't just say, from one of the top engineers at Google, only 200 people at Google out of 80-something thousand knew this, Operation Dragonfly.
[00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:49.562]  They've already implemented Dragonfly.
[00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:52.083]  We have the other internal documents that I've received.
[00:04:52.423 --> 00:04:58.045]  They don't know the name of it, but they're already phasing in the censorship incrementally right now here.
[00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:01.327]  They're going global, and China is the command base.
[00:05:03.894 --> 00:05:11.142]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:19.071]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:22.555]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:27.437]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:05:27.818 --> 00:05:31.720]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.661]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.264]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:42.865]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:58.152]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:05:58.392 --> 00:05:59.692]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:02.393]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:05.895]  We are drugged out!
[00:06:06.595 --> 00:06:08.836]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:12.222]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:06:12.782 --> 00:06:14.342]  Today, it all changes.
[00:06:14.642 --> 00:06:17.183]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:20.243]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:24.984]  Einstein says the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:28.085]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:30.386]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:32.646]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:34.587]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:06:34.787 --> 00:06:35.947]  We have the resources.
[00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:42.679]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.140]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.900]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.821]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:47.921]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:50.302]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:06:50.483 --> 00:06:54.164]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:06:55.645 --> 00:06:59.187]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:01.528]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:17.907]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:40.072]  I'm going to say something here that I've said probably a thousand times last year, but I'm going to lay it out and be crystal clear about it.
[00:07:40.872 --> 00:07:44.195]  Everything else is a side issue.
[00:07:45.976 --> 00:08:00.388]  Everything else is the fallout of the global government plan, the agenda developed by the multinational globalist combine
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:24.127]  Which was a development of Cecil Rhodes, British Intelligence, and the British Empire, phased into Pratt House, Council on Foreign Relations, 1922, when the British Empire was made subservient and folded into a new U.S.
[00:08:24.287 --> 00:08:25.107]  Empire plan.
[00:08:26.247 --> 00:08:28.628]  Now, Winston Churchill wrote books about this.
[00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:32.559]  Countless others have documented it.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.581]  That's what happened.
[00:08:35.722 --> 00:08:37.423]  That's mainline, Ph.D.
[00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:39.745]  level understanding of the U.S.
[00:08:41.446 --> 00:08:45.249]  There was a whole Anglophile movement where we started having British teacups and celebrating the Queen.
[00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:46.249]  That was the deal.
[00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:57.598]  That's why you see tabloids everywhere and they made it popularized to love the Queen again and all of that was because of that alliance that came during World War I and then after.
[00:08:58.865 --> 00:09:04.087]  You have to understand, though, that's the elites that controlled the UK and used it for their global empire, not the British people.
[00:09:05.227 --> 00:09:06.728]  So it's not a British conspiracy.
[00:09:06.748 --> 00:09:10.409]  It's not a German conspiracy, even though the royal family's German.
[00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:22.354]  The House of Windsor, with King George I replaced the previous Norman kings, who were Viking, basically, and then they were replaced, of course,
[00:09:28.459 --> 00:09:31.481]  The Transylvanians came in through Germany.
[00:09:32.182 --> 00:09:33.323]  But that's a whole other issue.
[00:09:33.563 --> 00:09:34.744]  That's just the backstory.
[00:09:39.768 --> 00:09:42.410]  That the people that run the British Empire are Transylvanians.
[00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.493]  You're like, wow, funny, is that a fact?
[00:09:46.513 --> 00:09:47.073]  Yeah, look it up.
[00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:52.558]  That's why Bram Stoker's Dracula is all putting history in there.
[00:09:54.379 --> 00:09:55.400]  Hiding in plain view.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:07.670]  And now we hear about the British Royal Family, and all the people that disappear, and the pedophilia, and the blood drinking, and the blood transfusions, and all the rest of it.
[00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.991]  But I'm digressing.
[00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:19.001]  They had cousins that were the Tsars, who themselves had a German-Hungarian, Austrian-Hungarian background.
[00:10:25.017 --> 00:10:30.960]  They went in in 1917, 1918, had the Bolshevik Revolution, British intelligence with U.S.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.224]  funding, and former Russian immigrants that came into the U.S., Jewish immigrants that came into the U.S., Russian Jewish immigrants.
[00:10:38.424 --> 00:10:39.205]  It's all history books.
[00:10:39.825 --> 00:10:46.989]  Again, went in in 1917, 1918, at the end of World War I, when Russia was weakened, took the czars out, brought in Bolshevism.
[00:10:48.544 --> 00:11:11.253]  Turned Russia into a new giant engine of the multinational corporations to expand into areas and play the opposition to the German Austrian-Hungarian Empire that had fallen to some of their cousins but was still another competing group.
[00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:13.014]  So the
[00:11:16.437 --> 00:11:19.979]  Saxe-Coburg-Gotha arm was taking out the Tsars.
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:29.403]  World War I had been about also taking out their other cousins that were another group in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire with those three competing factions.
[00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:40.408]  And the reason I've laid out those basics is Russia was used as this engine of tyranny
[00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:45.784]  And covert funding and invasion around the world and exploitation.
[00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:54.409]  But then the UN and the US and the British Empire could then play the good cops in opposition and resist it.
[00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:58.471]  And the fighting and the wars and the stuff that went on at many levels was real.
[00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:01.733]  But at the top, it was being coordinated and manipulated.
[00:12:03.614 --> 00:12:08.837]  Now, the Russians after World War II
[00:12:10.717 --> 00:12:18.522]  Had some different coup d'etats and things and were able to get partial control back over their country.
[00:12:19.763 --> 00:12:22.525]  But they were still following a Soviet communist system.
[00:12:23.705 --> 00:12:27.688]  And so then the Cold War became even more real for a while.
[00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:31.410]  And then the old Soviet Union finally fell apart.
[00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:35.133]  But by then, the plan of the Rockefellers in the 40s
[00:12:37.403 --> 00:12:58.234]  To put Mao Zedong and the Communists in charge of China and their dream of organizing the Chinese that are smart and hard-working, industrializing them, but having them be under communism, basically fascist controls what it is, of the rich elites, and then exploit the country just like they'd done Russia to take over the rest of the planet.
[00:13:02.797 --> 00:13:04.498]  And mainline universities, again,
[00:13:06.414 --> 00:13:11.556]  There are so many papers on this and they've declassified old Soviet records from the 60s, 70s, 80s.
[00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:12.776]  It's all true.
[00:13:14.617 --> 00:13:18.639]  There's a quote from David Rockefeller in the New York Times, 1977.
[00:13:19.239 --> 00:13:20.479]  Let's put that back up on screen.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:27.262]  The social experiment under Chairman Mao has been an incredible success.
[00:13:27.402 --> 00:13:28.402]  You can read the whole editorial.
[00:13:28.863 --> 00:13:33.985]  The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.
[00:13:34.245 --> 00:13:34.725]  Now the reason
[00:13:36.252 --> 00:13:42.096]  I laid out that earlier gestalt quick five minute on empires and the factions.
[00:13:42.136 --> 00:13:46.158]  If you don't know who the factions are, how are you ever going to know who you are?
[00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.379]  Or what faction you want to be with?
[00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:51.961]  How are you going to do that?
[00:13:53.942 --> 00:13:54.623]  That's a question.
[00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.173]  I'm asking you right now, because what I'm telling you is who the players are.
[00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:06.278]  And we've been brought up with Hollywood and the media and all these different angles, and people don't know what it is to be an American.
[00:14:06.558 --> 00:14:08.920]  They don't know who the players were when our country got founded.
[00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:17.648]  They don't understand how the Spanish Empire faded, the Portuguese Empire faded, how the French Empire had faded.
[00:14:18.328 --> 00:14:23.393]  And all there was was the British Empire getting weaker, so the Japanese thought they could take that over in World War II.
[00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:26.895]  And Hitler thought they were weak, he thought he could take them out as well.
[00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:29.136]  And then they teamed up with the United States.
[00:14:30.317 --> 00:14:35.881]  And this whole Anglophile movement rolled out, where the first Hollywood movies, they spoke in English accents, even though they weren't English.
[00:14:36.081 --> 00:14:40.364]  It was an attempt to actually civilize America again and have us re-merge with England.
[00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:41.965]  I mean, all this stuff got pushed.
[00:14:42.766 --> 00:14:44.487]  And it's all been going on right underneath the surface.
[00:14:45.008 --> 00:14:53.374]  And now, since the 40s, they put Mao Zedong in power, and moved everything to China as the final piece
[00:14:54.858 --> 00:14:59.381]  To leverage out Europe, the U.S., Canada, England, Australia, where nobody can compete.
[00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:01.562]  They're giving all the ports, all the rare of minerals.
[00:15:01.842 --> 00:15:04.024]  Globally, you're not even allowed to compete with the Chinese.
[00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:08.606]  It's all set up because no one can compete with a billion, 400 million slaves.
[00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:17.872]  No one can compete with, there's no daycare, and you chain your kid up at a power pole, and they get one meal a day, and they sit there and crap on the side of the road, and you go in and work in an apple factory.
[00:15:17.892 --> 00:15:22.355]  And there's suicide nets, and they'll take you out in the street and shoot you in the back of the head if you talk back.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.366]  And over here we're teaching us how to be weak, and how to fall apart, and not have to work, and we're telling five-year-olds that you're really a girl, you're really a boy.
[00:15:30.386 --> 00:15:36.352]  I mean, that is all psychological warfare systems that are illegal in China.
[00:15:38.253 --> 00:15:39.595]  And so it's an admitted plan.
[00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:45.200]  And now we already knew all this, but now it's coming into view, and what Rockefeller dreamed of is happening.
[00:15:46.172 --> 00:15:49.155]  What Rockefeller dreamed of is actually working!
[00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:58.964]  But Trump at the last minute, like, teleported in, and we're desperately trying to turn this around because where they're leading us in the Chinese century is hell on earth!
[00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:01.167]  I'll tell you the rest of the plan when we come back.
[00:16:04.853 --> 00:16:23.139]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:23.239 --> 00:16:29.161]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:30.202]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:33.463]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:34.143 --> 00:16:35.104]  And so much more.
[00:16:35.644 --> 00:16:36.805]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:37.025 --> 00:16:38.726]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.746 --> 00:16:44.450]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.751]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:47.712]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:50.174]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:50.374 --> 00:16:51.635]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.815 --> 00:16:53.636]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:54.176 --> 00:16:54.797]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:54.897 --> 00:16:56.198]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:56.338 --> 00:16:57.498]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:07.475 --> 00:17:10.576]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:11.136]  You're on the air.
[00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:12.297]  Thanks for holding.
[00:17:12.337 --> 00:17:13.177]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:17:13.377 --> 00:17:13.777]  Hey, brother.
[00:17:13.817 --> 00:17:13.997]  Sir.
[00:17:14.297 --> 00:17:14.657]  Good, man.
[00:17:14.678 --> 00:17:15.478]  Thank you for calling.
[00:17:15.558 --> 00:17:16.118]  Hey, hey.
[00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:20.640]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:27.202]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:17:27.222 --> 00:17:29.042]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:17:29.142 --> 00:17:35.305]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:17:36.565 --> 00:17:37.565]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:40.067]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[00:17:40.127 --> 00:17:41.647]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:43.648]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:17:44.068 --> 00:17:44.828]  And exactly.
[00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:49.130]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.690]  Boom!
[00:17:49.851 --> 00:17:52.672]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:17:52.732 --> 00:17:53.252]  It's amazing.
[00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:54.613]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[00:17:54.693 --> 00:17:57.554]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:18:07.082 --> 00:18:14.584]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:18:15.084 --> 00:18:28.168]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:18:29.648 --> 00:18:32.953]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through full space.
[00:18:33.433 --> 00:18:37.559]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:39.902]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:58.688]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[00:18:58.888 --> 00:18:59.609]  InfoWars.
[00:18:59.989 --> 00:19:01.491]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:19:02.324 --> 00:19:05.888]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:19:06.308 --> 00:19:08.751]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[00:19:09.051 --> 00:19:13.415]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[00:19:13.856 --> 00:19:15.717]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:19.241]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.
[00:19:19.281 --> 00:19:23.746]  bottles, Immune Gargle is perfect for the bathroom, kitchen, or wherever you go.
[00:19:24.366 --> 00:19:30.591]  The incredible new purifying formula is dentist recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.
[00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:38.657]  As a powerful hand purifier or oral cleansing formula, just a small spray will help you stay clean when you feel surrounded by toxins.
[00:19:39.198 --> 00:19:45.963]  With powerful yet simple ingredients, Immune Gargle features Silver Soul Nano Silver for a powerful cleansing alternative.
[00:19:46.383 --> 00:19:47.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:24.777 --> 00:20:31.402]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:32.242 --> 00:20:39.187]  Remember, remember 22 years ago, I made films.
[00:20:39.848 --> 00:20:49.215]  I did hundreds of radio shows and I said, all of your phones starting in 2000 will be tracked by chips, triangulated by cell towers.
[00:20:50.330 --> 00:21:02.939]  And everything you do will then be wired to the NSA, create a total map of where you go, what you do, and absolutely be a little government minder that monitors every facet of your life.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.843]  And then in the future, if you're not a good globalist, they will start to turn the functions off on the phone.
[00:21:08.543 --> 00:21:08.844]  You will...
[00:21:10.424 --> 00:21:15.907]  Have a global score on how valuable you are and who you are and how trusted you are.
[00:21:16.848 --> 00:21:20.190]  And all these years later, people go, how did you predict it?
[00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.810]  I didn't predict it.
[00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.771]  I was told this by NSA whistleblowers.
[00:21:24.052 --> 00:21:26.073]  And there was no one else that would report on it at the time.
[00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.656]  And they started having the military watch me.
[00:21:30.176 --> 00:21:31.997]  I started having the CIA come around.
[00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.398]  But then something funny happened.
[00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:40.122]  People inside government who knew all about this stuff, they were the ones that decided they don't like it.
[00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:48.986]  So then the different foundations began to attack me, saying, Jones is a government agent.
[00:21:50.087 --> 00:21:52.268]  That's how he knows all this stuff and you can't trust him.
[00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:53.570]  What does that even mean?
[00:21:56.552 --> 00:21:59.314]  I'm here saying you need to trust yourself.
[00:22:01.396 --> 00:22:02.377]  You need to trust God.
[00:22:02.417 --> 00:22:03.478]  You need to trust common sense.
[00:22:03.778 --> 00:22:06.560]  Well, now everybody knows I'm definitely not working for the New World Order.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.061]  I'm not a government agent of any type.
[00:22:09.002 --> 00:22:11.384]  Because everybody knows they're trying to destroy me.
[00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:26.863]  So just like we told you, everything that was coming, and it all happened just like we said, and just like we told you there's a big private corporate world government, and it was going to roll all this out against everybody and roll out the censorship, it's all happening because it was planned.
[00:22:28.184 --> 00:22:29.425]  The WikiLeaks documented it.
[00:22:29.445 --> 00:22:36.512]  Hillary Clinton has been giving speeches since the middle of the campaign saying, when I get elected we're going to shut down Alex Jones and fake news.
[00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.471]  And even though she didn't get elected, they're moving forward with it with these headlines.
[00:22:41.811 --> 00:22:45.053]  Jones taking off Spotify for hate speech.
[00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:49.074]  Jones taking off YouTube for bullying a child.
[00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:50.375]  They don't show where I did that.
[00:22:51.015 --> 00:22:53.496]  Jones taking off Facebook and it's, quote, a slap on the wrist.
[00:22:53.536 --> 00:22:53.896]  It's not.
[00:22:54.636 --> 00:22:58.478]  It's to take the precedent because Americans believe in, you know, three strikes or whatever.
[00:22:58.498 --> 00:23:00.018]  It's like, well, he kept getting warned.
[00:23:00.258 --> 00:23:01.779]  You know, he didn't get censored.
[00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:04.480]  He just got warned over and over again.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.121]  And so we had to digitally burn that book.
[00:23:10.356 --> 00:23:13.258]  They're saying they don't want me to be able to publish information.
[00:23:13.298 --> 00:23:14.619]  They don't want me to be able to talk.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.043]  They don't want me to be able to do anything.
[00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:29.290]  And then they have thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of articles a day saying Alex Jones did this to the Sandy Hook family.
[00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:30.211]  Alex Jones did that.
[00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:32.032]  Never showing where I did any of it.
[00:23:32.352 --> 00:23:33.854]  Alex Jones says Parkland didn't happen.
[00:23:34.054 --> 00:23:34.634]  Never showing.
[00:23:34.954 --> 00:23:37.817]  And then Bill Hemmer gets concerned and all the rest of it.
[00:23:37.877 --> 00:23:39.538]  And they lie to everyone.
[00:23:41.001 --> 00:24:10.203]  And they do it over and over again to set the precedent to outlaw this information that Communist China, allied with the globalists, allied with Pratt House and the British Empire plan, have done a giant double-cross of the entire West, using China and exploiting its people to drive down global living standards and to consolidate total power and control, and then let China get control of our debt,
[00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:18.974]  The propaganda system of the United States, Hollywood, our major universities, and now the iCloud keys.
[00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:21.415]  Apple's officially based there.
[00:24:21.435 --> 00:24:23.336]  Google's there.
[00:24:23.897 --> 00:24:27.899]  And now I can read Sky News or the London Guardian
[00:24:29.107 --> 00:24:30.327]  And it's exactly what I told you.
[00:24:30.707 --> 00:24:41.990]  Google whistleblower, one of only 200 that had the secret plans for Operation Dragonfly already in place in China, says the real danger is that similar systems are being built here in the U.S.
[00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.310]  and around the world by Google.
[00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:52.253]  When you actually read what the whistleblower told The Intercept, it's hiding in plain view.
[00:24:52.333 --> 00:24:53.653]  What do you think Google's doing?
[00:24:54.696 --> 00:25:08.359]  In Facebook, when Paul Watson wrote an article off public UN documents saying that the UN wants 600 million migrants.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.700]  That's what the Democrats are saying.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.400]  No borders at all.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.621]  That's what the Democrats are saying.
[00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:14.881]  Shut down ICE.
[00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:15.441]  No borders.
[00:25:15.501 --> 00:25:16.041]  No borders.
[00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:17.402]  Yeah, we want illegal aliens to vote.
[00:25:17.602 --> 00:25:18.682]  That's the globalist takeover.
[00:25:19.062 --> 00:25:22.083]  And now they go from denying it to saying, yes, that's what we're going to do.
[00:25:23.157 --> 00:25:26.406]  It's big corporations using the third world to take over and capture the West.
[00:25:26.807 --> 00:25:27.970]  It's total domination.
[00:25:29.474 --> 00:25:30.457]  And then they have...
[00:25:31.889 --> 00:25:46.719]  PolitiFact, now funded by Soros and others, say Paul Watson is fake, and put a thing over the browser where you can't share the article saying Paul Watson's fake, when right there in his article he links to the UN website, and I could play you them saying it.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:54.044]  And I could show Macron saying it a month ago, that they want 200 million North Africans to come in by 2035.
[00:25:58.439 --> 00:25:59.879]  The story's on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:00.299 --> 00:26:01.480]  Fake news fail.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.341]  Facebook flags accurate InfoWars story, citing you in docs.
[00:26:05.441 --> 00:26:25.505]  This morning, I tweeted a short video where yesterday and today, all over the news, they say that I am seeking $100,000 damages from the Sandy Hook parents that are selling me here in Texas.
[00:26:28.683 --> 00:26:35.309]  And that it's unprecedented, and that I'm a horrible person, and some of the articles say, Jones is beyond the scum of the earth.
[00:26:35.989 --> 00:26:37.631]  We've got to find new terms for him.
[00:26:38.371 --> 00:26:43.936]  And they all know that under state statute, now when you sue somebody for defamation, that kicks in.
[00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:48.160]  That if you're wrong, it's up to $100,000 in attorney's fees at the judge's discretion.
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:27:00.126]  And that to file with the statutes, you have to file your counter, that statute comes in, and then at the first hearing, if you want to, you can waive the attorney's fees.
[00:27:01.479 --> 00:27:17.605]  Which is unprecedented and we did it in front of at least 30 members of the so-called media and how many people reported that Alex Jones waived attorney's fees and Texas slap provision against the Sandy Hook parents as a high-road gesture.
[00:27:17.765 --> 00:27:27.849]  I've been reaching out to them for years and they know that and they're ignoring it and going forward and we are now actually having to look at
[00:27:30.678 --> 00:27:30.978]  Action.
[00:27:32.199 --> 00:27:40.965]  But, because it's true defamation to say we're sending people to people's houses to hurt them and then it's not true.
[00:27:41.405 --> 00:27:55.514]  It's true defamation for the media to know that we took the mega high road and didn't even open it up where we have a chance of getting the attorney fees back, which when they lose they have to give you.
[00:27:56.034 --> 00:27:57.035]  Just up to the judge how much.
[00:27:58.188 --> 00:28:09.492]  And the discipline of the corporate media is so incredible when it comes to lies that there are thousands of articles saying Alex Jones sued the Sandy Hook families, which that's not even what it is.
[00:28:09.853 --> 00:28:16.075]  They sued me, and just like in England, if you sue somebody for defamation and lose, you gotta pay.
[00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:18.056]  Well, Texas passed a law like that!
[00:28:18.156 --> 00:28:19.036]  That's the law!
[00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:25.839]  They all, and they were all waiting till the suit started, knowing that would be triggered so they could technically
[00:28:26.932 --> 00:28:35.920]  Be telling 10% of the truth that yes, it does in a form of suit trigger back that if they lose, it's up to the judge, may make them pay attorney's fees.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.324]  So they call that me wanting $100,000 and me suing them when I'm not.
[00:28:41.624 --> 00:28:42.986]  So we already knew they were going to do that.
[00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:50.232]  So the first thing at the hearing is Mr. Jones is waving that and the media groaned and got angry.
[00:28:53.021 --> 00:28:54.782]  And my lawyer said, well, we knew they'd do that.
[00:28:55.162 --> 00:28:56.362]  That's a group of criminals.
[00:28:57.062 --> 00:28:57.342]  Okay?
[00:28:57.723 --> 00:29:01.044]  Murdering truth, trained to hate America, scum of the earth.
[00:29:05.545 --> 00:29:06.545]  Hey, have you heard?
[00:29:07.025 --> 00:29:09.066]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:11.687]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, they're all censoring us.
[00:29:12.047 --> 00:29:17.949]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[00:29:18.249 --> 00:29:21.270]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:47.722]  You know, President Trump talks about how we need to be trailblazers, how we need to be outsiders, how we need to expose the current stagnant system that's been suppressing us, wanting to make us poor so we can consolidate control and buy us up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:29:47.762 --> 00:29:49.304]  That really is the globalist system.
[00:29:50.885 --> 00:29:51.786]  He's absolutely right.
[00:29:51.886 --> 00:29:58.132]  So it is an honor to be persecuted by the globalists, to be lied about, to be demonized.
[00:29:59.645 --> 00:30:08.889]  It's an honor to draw them out so we can show who they are so that you take action and you take the country back politically, culturally, spiritually, financially.
[00:30:09.129 --> 00:30:14.611]  Another hero is Julian Assange, who's been in solitary confinement in a closet-sized room.
[00:30:14.651 --> 00:30:17.852]  They converted a closet with a bed and enough room for a laptop.
[00:30:18.072 --> 00:30:19.734]  They took that away over a year ago.
[00:30:20.134 --> 00:30:22.017]  No communication with the outside.
[00:30:22.037 --> 00:30:24.059]  It's all been one hell of a time for him.
[00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:28.684]  And he was very bipartisan in that he exposed Republicans, he exposed Democrats.
[00:30:28.744 --> 00:30:38.616]  He very judiciously released information that exposed criminal activity of the NSA, criminal activity of the CIA, illegal spying on Congress, illegal spying on Trump.
[00:30:39.056 --> 00:30:49.399]  Illegal spying on me, but they had my home number, my old cell, my new cell, and my office line, and they had Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago private apartment number that I had.
[00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:55.700]  Total proof of Obama spying on Trump and yours truly a decade ago.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.661]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the real deal.
[00:30:57.801 --> 00:31:01.982]  And America's had freedom so long, people don't recognize real tyranny when it hits them right between the eyes.
[00:31:02.202 --> 00:31:05.323]  But everyone needs to go to Infowars.com.
[00:31:05.403 --> 00:31:07.664]  The article is right up there at the top of the page, red link.
[00:31:07.804 --> 00:31:08.705]  Petition to Trump.
[00:31:08.745 --> 00:31:09.825]  Pardon Julian Assange.
[00:31:09.905 --> 00:31:16.648]  And we go over the fact that he engaged in regular journalistic activity and did a wonderful job being advised by top journalism professors around the world.
[00:31:16.748 --> 00:31:18.429]  And that he was very, very fair about what he did.
[00:31:18.569 --> 00:31:21.050]  And that you need to send the message that he's a hero.
[00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:27.033]  Now, I know they claim he's a Russian agent with no evidence and all the rest of that garbage, even though they've released stuff on Russia and Israel as well, and China.
[00:31:27.113 --> 00:31:27.593]  It doesn't matter.
[00:31:27.673 --> 00:31:28.894]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:31:29.074 --> 00:31:30.875]  And you wouldn't have gotten elected without Drudge.
[00:31:30.995 --> 00:31:33.476]  You wouldn't have gotten elected without what you've done, obviously.
[00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:35.256]  You can't say it's any one person.
[00:31:35.276 --> 00:31:37.437]  But without any of us together, it wouldn't have happened.
[00:31:37.497 --> 00:31:40.859]  So we need the president to pardon Julian Assange.
[00:31:40.979 --> 00:31:44.320]  And you said in a speech, I don't care who got her illegal server.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.141]  It's illegal.
[00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:46.721]  It's about what she did that's wrong.
[00:31:46.921 --> 00:31:47.862]  Don't change the subject.
[00:31:48.082 --> 00:31:49.502]  Go back to that instinct, sir.
[00:31:49.923 --> 00:31:51.523]  But you told Assange, release it.
[00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:53.704]  You said release more stuff.
[00:31:54.144 --> 00:31:55.185]  And he's in the crosshairs.
[00:31:56.266 --> 00:31:59.256]  And he needs to be pardoned if he's brought back to the United States.
[00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:06.404]  Everything we do here at InfoWars is possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:32:19.248 --> 00:32:27.331]  Very, very cool logo and kind of more discreet so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.

[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.622]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.987 --> 00:33:21.551]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:33:22.031 --> 00:33:24.673]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.713 --> 00:33:30.417]  Alright!
[00:33:31.502 --> 00:33:36.365]  If you just joined us, I have tons of breaking news, a bunch of guests joining us, you name it, it's all just insane.
[00:33:36.385 --> 00:33:39.267]  A man with a firearm and car arrested near the Capitol.
[00:33:40.188 --> 00:33:43.510]  Secret Service investigates vehicle, White House checkpoints, surrounded area shut down.
[00:33:45.111 --> 00:33:48.294]  We've got Pence offers federal aid to thwart election fraud.
[00:33:48.354 --> 00:33:49.234]  That's really good news.
[00:33:49.254 --> 00:33:55.459]  The Democrats are openly having Democrats control cities, have illegal aliens vote.
[00:33:56.539 --> 00:34:00.002]  New York Times, new editorial board member, celebrated
[00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:14.421]  Dumb ass effing white people going extinct and so she's just a foaming at the mouth liberal anti-white racist.
[00:34:14.441 --> 00:34:19.526]  That's the operating system of the whole global program is anti-white.
[00:34:21.508 --> 00:34:22.870]  That's how the big mega banks
[00:34:23.874 --> 00:34:34.137]  And China think that they're going to organize the third world into hating the West and actively sabotaging it and bringing it down and cheering China is race-based politics.
[00:34:36.498 --> 00:34:39.078]  Chinese communists are cold-blooded.
[00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.940]  And I think people like her, because we know how much they've infiltrated the media and they've infiltrated
[00:34:45.706 --> 00:34:45.906]  I don't
[00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:03.106]  Offensive intelligence operations now.
[00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:04.467]  They're under siege.
[00:35:04.507 --> 00:35:05.187]  They're under attack.
[00:35:05.247 --> 00:35:05.927]  Putin said that.
[00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:06.627]  They've pulled back.
[00:35:06.867 --> 00:35:08.167]  They've cut their military spending.
[00:35:08.727 --> 00:35:13.448]  They've increased internal security spending because they are under globalist attack, just like we are.
[00:35:13.988 --> 00:35:22.070]  They've kicked more of the globalists out than we have, but they've got their own swamp and billions are spent each year by Soros alone and the State Department trying to topple them.
[00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.930]  We're involved in their elections.
[00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:26.690]  But it's not America doing it.
[00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.771]  It's the globalists allied with China.
[00:35:31.803 --> 00:35:36.246]  And I was reading the entire Intercept article and the documents they got from a whistleblower last night.
[00:35:36.266 --> 00:35:37.186]  I reread the whole article.
[00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:47.312]  And just like Dragonfly over there has these browsers that pop up just on regular things that are disputed that the Chinese government wants to control.
[00:35:47.592 --> 00:35:50.434]  But then there's thousands of terms that are totally banned.
[00:35:51.034 --> 00:35:56.217]  And then they can go in anytime they want into the browser and make it where you can't search something.
[00:35:57.458 --> 00:35:58.579]  And a big example of that was
[00:36:00.916 --> 00:36:05.519]  What just happened on iPhones for two weeks, about a week ago.
[00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:06.579]  It ended.
[00:36:06.979 --> 00:36:10.441]  The emoji of Taiwan could not be sent by iPhones.
[00:36:11.682 --> 00:36:12.562]  And not just in China.
[00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:16.164]  That's the level of control.
[00:36:16.224 --> 00:36:27.211]  You go choose the emoji, and when it goes across the network, it's recognized by the little backdoor software that Apple controls, and it turns your phone off.
[00:36:28.811 --> 00:36:29.652]  And they admitted, oh,
[00:36:31.638 --> 00:36:36.323]  We've moved to China, and they now run us, and that's what they wanted to do.
[00:36:39.986 --> 00:36:44.491]  And by the way, when it first broke, it was security researcher accuses Apple of censoring Taiwan flag in China.
[00:36:44.531 --> 00:36:45.111]  No, it happened.
[00:36:45.452 --> 00:36:47.133]  It was happening outside as well.
[00:36:47.654 --> 00:36:52.239]  I mean, they are now making airlines not call it that are outside of China.
[00:36:53.049 --> 00:36:54.130]  American Airlines, you name it.
[00:36:54.590 --> 00:37:01.494]  If they want to land in China, you've got to take Taiwan off your magazines, off of your maps, off of everything!
[00:37:03.556 --> 00:37:04.636]  So, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:37:04.977 --> 00:37:06.638]  What I'm saying is, do you understand?
[00:37:07.238 --> 00:37:10.200]  They're popularizing modern book burning.
[00:37:12.483 --> 00:37:24.305]  Which is digital burning of information by saying, oh de-platform Alex Jones, The Morning Joe, America's Newsroom, all of them unified saying, take Alex Jones off the air.
[00:37:24.625 --> 00:37:25.626]  Take him off the air.
[00:37:26.006 --> 00:37:28.226]  He won't stop bullying Sandy Hook families.
[00:37:28.866 --> 00:37:30.026]  He's doing it right now.
[00:37:31.447 --> 00:37:32.307]  He's suing them.
[00:37:32.627 --> 00:37:33.247]  None of it's true.
[00:37:35.988 --> 00:37:37.348]  We gotta protect the children.
[00:37:40.694 --> 00:37:41.995]  We're the good people at Fox.
[00:37:42.035 --> 00:37:43.235]  We're the good people at CNN.
[00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:46.217]  We're the good people at MSNBC.
[00:37:48.338 --> 00:37:49.959]  And Alex is the bad man.
[00:37:49.999 --> 00:37:53.221]  We just lie you into wars and are anti-American and...
[00:37:54.462 --> 00:37:57.524]  We just promoted the Arab Spring that was a big jihadi takeover.
[00:37:57.544 --> 00:37:58.905]  We're just promoting war with Russia.
[00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:07.951]  But Alex Jones, when the public questioned a public event because of government's history of manipulating things, said people have a right to question.
[00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:10.493]  And then for years said, OK, I think it happened.
[00:38:10.793 --> 00:38:12.894]  It doesn't matter because they'll never have me say that.
[00:38:13.315 --> 00:38:21.160]  They'll never show it because they're going to lie about it on the news to, again, continue to demonize people that are telling the truth.
[00:38:23.677 --> 00:38:26.918]  This is how you get Americans organized to kill the First Amendment.
[00:38:29.339 --> 00:38:33.940]  It's how you get them to set the precedent of, oh, well, we have a First Amendment, but not for Alex Jones.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.841]  And then, oh, all these congressmen suddenly can't tweet.
[00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:40.802]  Oh, all these other people are suddenly being kicked off and censored.
[00:38:41.042 --> 00:38:41.142]  Oh!
[00:38:41.162 --> 00:38:41.202]  Oh!
[00:38:48.134 --> 00:38:57.536]  Google's coming out with a total censorship system with the Communist Chinese, and then their own engineer that leaked info said, and they're developing all of that here.
[00:38:57.636 --> 00:38:59.717]  Yes, they've already implemented and broke their algorithm.
[00:38:59.997 --> 00:39:02.677]  Google doesn't work not just for my name, but for most stuff.
[00:39:03.238 --> 00:39:03.998]  It's fried.
[00:39:04.018 --> 00:39:09.919]  Because it doesn't work off an algorithm of what you actually search and do now, and what's popular and what's helpful and what's rated.
[00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:11.960]  It's run by what the Central Committee wants.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.400]  And that's all public!
[00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:19.695]  And now the infrastructure is being totally moved there to run that operation from China.
[00:39:19.955 --> 00:39:23.162]  And China has all your Google codes, all your Apple codes, everything.
[00:39:23.322 --> 00:39:25.085]  And that's all even in Reuters!
[00:39:26.715 --> 00:39:27.375]  I'm gonna say it again.
[00:39:27.636 --> 00:39:31.338]  Apple is officially Chinese state-run now.
[00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:33.279]  They pay no taxes.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.781]  They own slave factories.
[00:39:36.501 --> 00:39:38.243]  They lease and run slave factories.
[00:39:38.443 --> 00:39:40.224]  They have the worst factories in the world.
[00:39:40.764 --> 00:39:45.107]  But they're liberal and give $100 million to Black Lives Matter so it's okay.
[00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:46.968]  Oh look, I like black people.
[00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:48.990]  The police are evil and are killing them.
[00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:54.071]  Oh look, 140-something black people got shot by, you know, police or whatever last year.
[00:39:54.111 --> 00:39:55.471]  Let's say it was all wrong.
[00:39:55.771 --> 00:39:57.651]  Okay, is that the biggest issue in the world?
[00:39:58.512 --> 00:39:58.712]  No.
[00:39:59.412 --> 00:40:01.832]  It's done as a distractionary operation.
[00:40:02.592 --> 00:40:05.133]  Because Tim Cook is ruthless and wicked!
[00:40:07.593 --> 00:40:09.834]  China is selling political dissonance organs!
[00:40:10.514 --> 00:40:12.254]  Google is officially helping them do it.
[00:40:13.074 --> 00:40:14.254]  They had congressional hearings.
[00:40:14.274 --> 00:40:15.335]  I'm going to read you some of the transcripts.
[00:40:15.355 --> 00:40:16.875]  We've got to pull it up from C-SPAN when we come back.
[00:40:17.776 --> 00:40:25.780]  From years ago, when Google was already working with the Chinese and got caught, there were huge scandals, they called it treason in Congress, and they supposedly quit.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:33.423]  But now, everyone's running back in and complying with the censorship, and that's what Trump's trying to change.
[00:40:33.443 --> 00:40:44.168]  Now, you've got a choice to make as listeners and viewers and station owners and managers, and people are sticking by us and standing up against the propaganda that really pisses the system off, but I want to thank you for your support.
[00:40:45.531 --> 00:40:48.224]  But all of you need to seriously have a gut check time.
[00:40:49.366 --> 00:40:51.447]  And understand that we are the tip of the spear.
[00:40:51.527 --> 00:40:52.967]  We are under unprecedented attack.
[00:40:53.227 --> 00:40:55.147]  And without you, we're not going to be on the air.
[00:40:55.387 --> 00:41:00.229]  They're going to be able to shut us down, sue us out of existence, demonize us, and their tactics are going to work.
[00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:02.289]  But so far, you've been standing with us.
[00:41:02.369 --> 00:41:08.050]  But we need to sell a ton of t-shirts, water filters, high-quality supplements, you name it.
[00:41:08.451 --> 00:41:10.471]  They've done everything they can to attack our revenue streams.
[00:41:10.831 --> 00:41:12.912]  They have failed at that, by the grace of God.
[00:41:13.432 --> 00:41:17.213]  And we've got so many big specials going right now at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:23.081]  You have to.
[00:42:23.222 --> 00:42:25.423]  And I want to thank those of you that have bought the products and loved them.
[00:42:25.784 --> 00:42:27.965]  And I'm just saying, reorder every couple of years.
[00:42:27.985 --> 00:42:30.087]  You need new reorder filters for your Lexapur.
[00:42:31.388 --> 00:42:33.770]  Water filtration, you're pro-pure water filtration.
[00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:46.478]  Just think about shopping at Infowars, shopping with the good guys and changing the world and standing with us against the unprecedented lying assault as they try to use us as the guinea pig to shut down everybody else.
[00:42:46.838 --> 00:42:50.020]  And Ted Cruz and Tucker Carlson, they all get it.
[00:42:50.441 --> 00:42:52.582]  But certain people at Fox News and others don't.
[00:42:52.822 --> 00:42:55.724]  We're going to cover that too, coming up with those clips.
[00:42:55.824 --> 00:43:01.188]  But when I come back, how to win, how to defeat the globalists, I will give you the devastating information.
[00:43:03.028 --> 00:43:06.989]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[00:43:07.049 --> 00:43:14.511]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:20.392]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[00:43:23.813 --> 00:43:26.754]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[00:43:27.814 --> 00:43:28.554]  But he didn't give up.
[00:43:29.858 --> 00:43:30.298]  And he won.
[00:43:32.039 --> 00:43:33.460]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:38.304]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given victory.
[00:43:39.544 --> 00:43:42.767]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:44.768]  And they all died.
[00:43:45.028 --> 00:43:46.369]  All 180 plus men.
[00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:51.753]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[00:43:53.354 --> 00:43:57.597]  So I don't know how the Infowars fight is gonna end.
[00:43:57.797 --> 00:43:59.418]  But I know this.
[00:44:01.946 --> 00:44:22.217]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance, I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and save victory or death.
[00:44:23.737 --> 00:44:27.418]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[00:44:28.338 --> 00:44:35.881]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:47.784]  But that said, just like our information is game changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[00:44:50.171 --> 00:44:53.533]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there.
[00:44:54.534 --> 00:44:56.675]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[00:44:57.055 --> 00:44:59.276]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:00.917]  PQQ, CoQ10.
[00:45:03.268 --> 00:45:10.975]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[00:45:11.396 --> 00:45:24.008]  They sell PQQ in little bottles with a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like 40, 50 bucks for a little bottle.
[00:45:25.094 --> 00:45:26.775]  Think about that.
[00:45:26.855 --> 00:45:27.516]  It's $74 right now.
[00:45:28.457 --> 00:45:33.381]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[00:45:34.422 --> 00:45:35.723]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[00:45:35.783 --> 00:45:44.130]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.171]  So I signed a bigger contract, got a better deal.
[00:45:47.192 --> 00:45:52.977]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're going to want lower price on this and get the best product.
[00:45:52.997 --> 00:45:54.198]  So I've not gambled.
[00:45:54.779 --> 00:45:55.640]  I know you want value.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.381]  So we bought even more of it.
[00:45:58.302 --> 00:46:00.384]  We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it.
[00:46:00.944 --> 00:46:07.450]  And we've got it right now at the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're going to find anywhere.
[00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:08.831]  DNA Force.
[00:46:08.931 --> 00:46:10.292]  Go read the five-star reviews.
[00:46:10.432 --> 00:46:10.973]  Thousands of them.
[00:46:11.253 --> 00:46:12.714]  Go see what people said it did for them.
[00:46:13.135 --> 00:46:14.076]  It is dramatic.
[00:46:15.282 --> 00:46:23.064]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[00:46:23.784 --> 00:46:32.286]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[00:46:32.826 --> 00:46:39.508]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at MFullRestore.com or you can call AAA-253-3139.
[00:46:42.285 --> 00:46:47.888]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[00:46:48.089 --> 00:46:48.549]  That's fine.
[00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:51.050]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[00:46:51.471 --> 00:46:52.151]  I'm funded by you.
[00:46:52.391 --> 00:46:53.272]  So thank you all.
[00:46:53.952 --> 00:46:58.935]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[00:46:59.475 --> 00:47:02.177]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.021]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.868 --> 00:47:28.905]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:47.509 --> 00:47:57.056]  President Trump has come out and said that the mainstream media, when they are lying about his agenda and trying to sabotage peace deals and the economy, are enemies of the American people.
[00:47:57.417 --> 00:48:02.921]  When Bill Maher says he wants a depression to keep Americans under their control, that's called siege.
[00:48:03.541 --> 00:48:09.806]  That is a form of total warfare, one of the most ancient, one of the most cruel, one of the most effective.
[00:48:10.526 --> 00:48:12.328]  Everything you see out of Hollywood
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:19.082]  It's globalist, shycom, committee-formed battle plans.
[00:48:21.003 --> 00:48:35.468]  And when you see every major network and TV show in the country, from movies to sitcoms to dramas to cartoons to mainstream news, saying I'm a racist, saying I'm a liar, saying I hurt children,
[00:48:38.188 --> 00:48:39.589]  That's at the highest levels.
[00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:44.392]  Those decisions were made, those orders were given, and they were implemented.
[00:48:44.953 --> 00:48:45.653]  To the letter.
[00:48:46.233 --> 00:48:47.014]  Spit shine.
[00:48:51.017 --> 00:48:52.398]  Now that's how far down we are.
[00:48:53.158 --> 00:48:53.899]  But here's the good news.
[00:48:54.979 --> 00:48:56.520]  It's only up from here, as you can see.
[00:48:59.222 --> 00:49:03.505]  Because they've been artificially trying to suppress this country for decades and decades.
[00:49:04.326 --> 00:49:06.527]  And now all that stealth's been blown apart.
[00:49:07.517 --> 00:49:11.879]  And that's why they are so desperate to get me off of the air.
[00:49:12.399 --> 00:49:16.481]  They cannot stand it because my instincts are just like the president's instincts.
[00:49:17.022 --> 00:49:23.685]  And I come from a very similar background when it comes to how I was educated, informed, and then shown how the world worked.
[00:49:25.246 --> 00:49:26.266]  I wasn't indoctrinated.
[00:49:26.346 --> 00:49:27.607]  I was shown how it really worked.
[00:49:29.693 --> 00:49:30.334]  Shown history.
[00:49:30.414 --> 00:49:31.275]  Shown the combine.
[00:49:31.315 --> 00:49:32.316]  Shown the power structure.
[00:49:32.676 --> 00:49:34.358]  Shown how things really operate.
[00:49:34.898 --> 00:49:42.426]  Not how they teach the sheeple to keep you at a subservient, peon, serf, slave level.
[00:49:45.936 --> 00:49:47.438]  The President's been calling him the enemy.
[00:49:47.458 --> 00:49:50.622]  He's been talking about China infiltrating us, China selling us out.
[00:49:50.883 --> 00:49:53.386]  You're seeing news articles about how they've taken over major universities.
[00:49:53.666 --> 00:49:56.190]  You're seeing articles about why they have 98% of rare earth minerals.
[00:49:57.211 --> 00:50:00.495]  You see articles now where China says we're at war with the US.
[00:50:01.676 --> 00:50:03.417]  Economically, we're encircling them.
[00:50:04.258 --> 00:50:06.359]  We're putting social pressure on their people.
[00:50:06.399 --> 00:50:10.302]  You see NYU top professors saying, they're mal-brigades everywhere.
[00:50:10.342 --> 00:50:11.683]  They say they're going to overthrow America.
[00:50:11.763 --> 00:50:12.303]  I'm a liberal.
[00:50:12.324 --> 00:50:13.064]  This is dangerous.
[00:50:13.704 --> 00:50:14.765]  These people aren't liberals.
[00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:15.726]  These are authoritarians.
[00:50:15.766 --> 00:50:16.146]  Danger!
[00:50:16.186 --> 00:50:16.526]  Danger!
[00:50:20.529 --> 00:50:21.810]  How many professors have we had on?
[00:50:22.491 --> 00:50:23.451]  Like, Hamamoto.
[00:50:24.412 --> 00:50:28.255]  They're at one of the major universities in California.
[00:50:28.575 --> 00:50:29.876]  They're in the meetings.
[00:50:31.087 --> 00:50:36.031]  And he goes to the meetings and the left is, we are going to create a race consciousness for world government.
[00:50:36.251 --> 00:50:37.872]  We're going to use whites as the catalyst.
[00:50:38.153 --> 00:50:41.695]  We're going to teach everyone who isn't white they're bad because of demographic numbers.
[00:50:42.356 --> 00:50:45.759]  We know the average human, if they're told to be tribal, will be racist.
[00:50:46.039 --> 00:50:50.863]  We're going to sabotage the Christian ethic, the ethos, of unifying under Christ.
[00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:57.113]  That's why the West has been the folks that have reformed slavery and reformed abuse and reformed all the things.
[00:50:57.674 --> 00:51:07.961]  That was our strength, was unifying people under free market ideas, under Protestant worth ethic ethos that many historians and others have pointed out.
[00:51:09.782 --> 00:51:14.766]  And so they're organizing it into a system to totally bring the country down.
[00:51:15.686 --> 00:51:18.068]  And Trump has to go ahead and just come right out with it.
[00:51:19.019 --> 00:51:30.440]  And he has to go ahead and come right out with the fact that China has infiltrated, owns our debt, owns Hollywood, controls most of the universities through treason, and is working with leftists.
[00:51:32.861 --> 00:51:34.482]  To absolutely take the country over.
[00:51:34.522 --> 00:51:40.346]  If you were going to take America over, you'd feminize the men, you'd put chemicals in the water, you'd break up the family, you'd dumb people down.
[00:51:40.606 --> 00:51:42.748]  The average adult spends half their time watching TV.
[00:51:43.108 --> 00:51:44.389]  That study came out yesterday.
[00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:51.794]  You would play down nationalism, you would play down sovereignty, you would play down all those things, except in little limited areas you controlled.
[00:51:55.516 --> 00:52:02.021]  And then you would get the country into debt to that foreign power, and then you would have them come in and buy up the media, and the universities,
[00:52:04.215 --> 00:52:18.071]  And then try to break down the borders and bring in unlimited numbers of non-whites who, if they were taught about the Constitution, Bill of Rights, some type of operating system like a Christian ethos where we unify around our shared values, that will work.
[00:52:18.352 --> 00:52:19.453]  That will take us to the stars.
[00:52:19.673 --> 00:52:21.415]  It's why Christianity is so successful everywhere.
[00:52:21.575 --> 00:52:21.876]  But no!
[00:52:23.911 --> 00:52:32.417]  Instead, they go with a divide-and-conquer, total race-based system and put chips on the shoulders of the millions and millions of invaders they're bringing in.
[00:52:32.857 --> 00:52:45.245]  The good news is, though, Hispanic Americans and black Americans in poll numbers in the last year are showing double the support they did, even in fake polls, even in skewed polls, for Trump a year ago.
[00:52:45.906 --> 00:52:46.486]  They get it.
[00:52:46.926 --> 00:52:47.827]  They've been watching.
[00:52:48.107 --> 00:52:50.749]  People figure out when there's a scam going on.
[00:52:51.928 --> 00:52:55.150]  You can get fooled for a while, but then people are going, wait a minute.
[00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:55.971]  He didn't really say that.
[00:52:56.231 --> 00:52:57.031]  He didn't really do that.
[00:52:57.231 --> 00:52:57.912]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:52:58.092 --> 00:52:59.133]  They're lying about all that.
[00:52:59.813 --> 00:53:01.054]  Wait, they're trying to divide people.
[00:53:01.074 --> 00:53:05.456]  I mean, we can't just have a totally open border and abolish ICE and say there's no control.
[00:53:05.476 --> 00:53:08.578]  A lot of folks that fled from Mexico are like, please don't do that.
[00:53:08.698 --> 00:53:10.739]  God, that's what I ran away from.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.321]  And so people get it.
[00:53:15.316 --> 00:53:15.917]  Look at these numbers.
[00:53:16.137 --> 00:53:16.417]  Poll.
[00:53:16.617 --> 00:53:17.178]  Trump approval 50%.
[00:53:17.779 --> 00:53:22.083]  That's in fake Gallup polls and others where they add 15% more Democrats.
[00:53:22.724 --> 00:53:26.208]  Five points higher than Obama at this point in the presidency in the same poll.
[00:53:26.468 --> 00:53:28.010]  Hispanics boosting numbers.
[00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:29.371]  That's DrugsReport.com.
[00:53:33.916 --> 00:53:35.178]  So he's broken through their hoax.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.201]  He's broken through their lies.
[00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:43.405]  People now know they were conned, and we're going to break through on the Sandy Hook stuff, where they're lying about what I said.
[00:53:43.745 --> 00:53:51.931]  We're going to break through on all the things that they've manufactured about me, where they pick a topic and they say, Trump lies all the time.
[00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:54.393]  Trump is the most biggest liar in the world.
[00:53:54.453 --> 00:53:55.594]  You see that talking point everywhere.
[00:53:55.854 --> 00:53:57.235]  He just, everything he says is a lie.
[00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:03.112]  And you read the fact checkers, just like they say everything we say is a lie.
[00:54:03.892 --> 00:54:04.833]  Fake news fail!
[00:54:05.153 --> 00:54:08.875]  Facebook flags accurate info war story citing UN documents.
[00:54:09.095 --> 00:54:11.857]  The UN says we will bring in 600 million migrants.
[00:54:12.177 --> 00:54:16.159]  We will politicize them and we will use them to get rid of the capitalist society.
[00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:19.341]  It's all in the UN document linked at the UN website.
[00:54:19.841 --> 00:54:26.065]  But they said it's false, completely false, on the PolitiFact meter because
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:36.686]  Paul talked about how Discovery revealed, well no one had ever seen these documents, UN plan to flood America with 600 million from 2002.
[00:54:38.888 --> 00:54:43.511]  Now, false, misleading info or story says UN plans to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:54:45.593 --> 00:54:53.359]  And he goes on to say it's misleading, doesn't say how, and then you go to our article, it links to the UN, saying it word for word, and we have copies of it saved right here.
[00:54:53.679 --> 00:54:54.900]  And that's why they want to take us down.
[00:54:56.181 --> 00:54:58.383]  I mean, I've got Macron right here.
[00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:08.999]  Two weeks ago, Shedd, on TV, gave a speech, endorses $200 million plus mass migration plan.
[00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:14.224]  He called it, Your Africa.
[00:55:16.787 --> 00:55:18.569]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:19.289]  He gave a speech.
[00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.990]  We played it.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.382]  They say, Trump, you never said that we shouldn't have the Iraq War in 2003.
[00:55:26.422 --> 00:55:27.562]  You're a liar.
[00:55:27.602 --> 00:55:29.944]  And then we played Fox News and CNN, four clips of it.
[00:55:30.604 --> 00:55:36.987]  And what I'm saying is, I know you know they lie, but it's next-level lying, folks.
[00:55:37.968 --> 00:55:42.270]  Where the talking point is, Trump hates all Mexicans and says they're all murderers and rapists.
[00:55:43.031 --> 00:55:43.711]  There's no such clip.
[00:55:45.162 --> 00:55:46.723]  You know, there's a lot of good people in Mexico.
[00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:50.666]  We need to get the good ones up here and we need to vet them so they don't have a criminal record.
[00:55:51.306 --> 00:55:55.630]  And if you've been here a long time and you are working and you're good, we'll fast track you to citizenship.
[00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:57.851]  It needs to be made easier if you're a good, hard-working person.
[00:55:58.251 --> 00:56:02.394]  But if you've been deported five, six times and you've got an armed robbery conviction, you're going to be deported.
[00:56:02.595 --> 00:56:04.576]  You know, a lot of people coming across aren't even from Mexico.
[00:56:04.616 --> 00:56:05.237]  They're from all over.
[00:56:05.477 --> 00:56:06.798]  There's murderers and there's rapists.
[00:56:07.884 --> 00:56:11.686]  That turns into Trump saying all Mexicans are murderers and rapists.
[00:56:11.986 --> 00:56:12.806]  It's a lie.
[00:56:13.066 --> 00:56:13.706]  It's a fraud.
[00:56:13.746 --> 00:56:19.189]  And imagine the people saying it are the ones actually saying all Mexicans are murderers and rapists.
[00:56:21.189 --> 00:56:25.091]  Just like they keep saying, Alex Jones says go to the Sandy Hook parents' house.
[00:56:25.471 --> 00:56:26.371]  You know, be violent.
[00:56:26.932 --> 00:56:27.572]  There's no video.
[00:56:27.592 --> 00:56:28.372]  There's no audio.
[00:56:28.432 --> 00:56:28.993]  It's not true.
[00:56:29.453 --> 00:56:32.414]  The New York Times had all these things that weren't even quotes.
[00:56:35.796 --> 00:56:37.818]  And it says, Jones says go to their houses.
[00:56:37.959 --> 00:56:38.700]  Never said that.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.922]  In fact, stop saying I'm saying that.
[00:56:42.044 --> 00:56:43.145]  I met with lawyers last night.
[00:56:43.485 --> 00:56:44.847]  We have very good lawsuits.
[00:56:46.489 --> 00:56:47.430]  Very good lawsuits.
[00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:49.753]  And I know the media does this where thousands of publications do it.
[00:56:50.013 --> 00:56:51.275]  So you think there's strength in numbers?
[00:56:51.315 --> 00:56:54.158]  Like, I mean, if he sues us, he'll only pick off a few people.
[00:56:54.178 --> 00:56:55.280]  I mean, that's the tactic.
[00:56:56.925 --> 00:56:57.526]  It doesn't matter.
[00:56:58.507 --> 00:57:03.315]  I need to raise a lot of money, because I'm not a litigious person, but we have to start suing the media.
[00:57:04.036 --> 00:57:11.108]  When they show quotes that I never said, and when they're telling people Alex Jones says go out to people's kids, and all these lies, I have to sue them.
[00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:13.256]  I have to.
[00:57:14.016 --> 00:57:15.917]  And I've done some lawsuits.
[00:57:15.937 --> 00:57:21.979]  You've noticed since I sued, countersued, five people suing me, there have been no more lawsuits in the last few months.
[00:57:22.619 --> 00:57:22.819]  See?
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.460]  So, I mean, we know what we're doing here, but it takes a lot of money.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.521]  And the right lawyers, Infowarsstore.com, we're in a war.
[00:57:28.581 --> 00:57:33.443]  Help us, stand with us, and we will expose the Chi-Com globalist takeover of America.
[00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:41.929]  That's so outrageous, and the fact that everyone serving the Hollywood leftist system is a sellout to the actual Qaikom takeover of the planet.
[00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:44.031]  And Trump needs to go ahead and just come out and say it.
[00:57:44.351 --> 00:57:46.273]  I know he can't say it, but he's already starting to.
[00:57:46.473 --> 00:57:49.735]  He needs to go all the way, and so Americans know which side to pick.
[00:57:49.775 --> 00:57:51.737]  They will pick America and prosperity.
[00:57:54.554 --> 00:57:56.595]  The InfoWars official app.
[00:57:56.835 --> 00:57:57.676]  It's amazing.
[00:57:57.716 --> 00:57:58.416]  It works great.
[00:57:58.817 --> 00:58:00.378]  It's got so many incredible features.
[00:58:00.438 --> 00:58:05.821]  You can download it free on Android and Apple at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:58:05.901 --> 00:58:08.383]  Or there's a big banner up on InfoWars.com.
[00:58:08.403 --> 00:58:09.704]  But why this is important is...
[00:58:10.464 --> 00:58:12.486]  The globalists are demonizing InfoWars.
[00:58:12.606 --> 00:58:14.387]  We are the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[00:58:14.467 --> 00:58:17.450]  The dreaded organization that they hate so much.
[00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:19.952]  And they are so scared of people power.
[00:58:19.972 --> 00:58:21.553]  They are so scared of you.
[00:58:21.754 --> 00:58:26.438]  Not just downloading the app, but sharing it with your neighbors, your friends, folks at church.
[00:58:26.758 --> 00:58:29.360]  Sending out a link to your email list or Facebook.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:29.660]  I don't
[00:58:53.808 --> 00:59:03.237]  It's at Infowars.com forward slash app or there's a big banner right on the right hand side of the page on Infowars.com, Newswars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:03.257 --> 00:59:18.490]  There's a lot of features like listen in the background, have the show on during any activity, a list of the latest shows, live notifications when we're going live, support the show, spread the news both in and outside of the app, see current super sales and browse the Infowars store
[00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:18.950]  We're good to go.
[00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:59.737]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.663]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:20.223 --> 01:00:22.604]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.265 --> 01:00:29.048]  Alexandria Cortez, little rich girl that poses as some poor bartender.
[01:00:29.068 --> 01:00:39.933]  I already call her a congresswoman because, you know, Republicans basically don't even usually run candidates in New York City against the other person, but they are, and they should to expose her.
[01:00:41.154 --> 01:00:42.575]  She stormed Los Angeles.
[01:00:43.834 --> 01:00:51.838]  Which, again, is descending into a burning, stinking, piles of feces everywhere, heroin needles everywhere, hell hole.
[01:00:53.219 --> 01:00:54.940]  A veritable hell hole.
[01:00:56.881 --> 01:01:03.284]  She storms into that, and then goes down to the border, and bitches and complains that there's a fence there.
[01:01:03.304 --> 01:01:06.606]  Yeah, lady, the Mexicans got a fence right past that, too.
[01:01:07.426 --> 01:01:12.069]  They got a wall on their southern border, because Guatemala is even way worse than Mexico.
[01:01:13.032 --> 01:01:13.572]  Real shame.
[01:01:13.592 --> 01:01:21.094]  Mexico's a really neat country and has had some better periods, but corruption set in, so the social compact was broken.
[01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:30.517]  And you've got the British aristocracy that controlled America that we kicked out, but they never really kicked out the colonialists out of Mexico.
[01:01:31.137 --> 01:01:41.620]  You can look at the photos of her with a Hollywood scum, and she's down there looking all angry and upset through the fence at those meanie, meanie, meanies
[01:01:43.579 --> 01:02:10.013]  I will offer Cortez $100,000 to her favorite charity if she will go with a cameraman and even a jujitsu fighter, but no weapons because Mexico doesn't allow that, into South Texas across the Rio Grande
[01:02:12.642 --> 01:02:14.543]  And she can pick anywhere, even in the middle of the desert.
[01:02:15.923 --> 01:02:17.704]  Or she can do it, you know, right over McAllen.
[01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:23.006]  I will give her $100,000 of her charity if she'll go spend one day.
[01:02:24.526 --> 01:02:31.609]  But she's gotta walk in two miles, she's gotta turn and walk another two miles, and then come back another two miles.
[01:02:31.889 --> 01:02:36.090]  She's gotta go walk six miles over the Texas-Mexico border.
[01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:37.931]  How about over El Paso?
[01:02:39.138 --> 01:02:43.640]  Where there are tens of thousands of dead bodies they've dug up there of women, mainly.
[01:02:45.241 --> 01:02:45.861]  And children.
[01:02:47.342 --> 01:02:54.485]  Because if the folks don't pay them the money they want, when they shake them down again, they kill them.
[01:02:54.966 --> 01:03:01.429]  Oh, and it's not a country boy like Alex Jones wearing a Stetson hat like in Robert Rodriguez's movie shooting pregnant
[01:03:02.475 --> 01:03:03.416]  Mexican women in the stomach.
[01:03:03.556 --> 01:03:04.136]  That's a movie.
[01:03:04.176 --> 01:03:04.776]  That wasn't real.
[01:03:05.096 --> 01:03:06.097]  The machete comes along.
[01:03:06.337 --> 01:03:09.058]  In the real world, a guy looks like machete.
[01:03:09.079 --> 01:03:09.999]  80% of the women are raped.
[01:03:10.399 --> 01:03:11.920]  That's even Amnesty International.
[01:03:12.941 --> 01:03:14.041]  80% are raped.
[01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:14.982]  Raped.
[01:03:16.142 --> 01:03:16.843]  They're raped.
[01:03:18.323 --> 01:03:21.205]  And then, a lot of times they get put in a shallow grave.
[01:03:22.826 --> 01:03:24.967]  So, you're so mad about that fence, lady.
[01:03:26.397 --> 01:03:40.341]  You're just such an angel and such a hero trying to break it down for the UN, trying to flood and collapse the country and get as many poor, ignorant people in here as you can to get on a plantation and politically run their lives and control them so you can be the chief.
[01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:41.841]  You can be the El Jefe.
[01:03:42.181 --> 01:03:43.121]  You can run their lives.
[01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.883]  Where's the Hispanic lady running for Congress that's free market?
[01:03:48.403 --> 01:03:49.763]  And says, we don't want to be Venezuela.
[01:03:49.983 --> 01:03:50.863]  We don't want to be Cuba.
[01:03:50.883 --> 01:03:51.684]  We don't want to be North Korea.
[01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:52.484]  I'd vote for her.
[01:03:52.864 --> 01:03:53.284]  I'd love it.
[01:03:55.606 --> 01:03:57.927]  You know, those women are out there and the numbers show it.
[01:03:59.608 --> 01:04:03.569]  And it's frightening that this is what the media force feeds on everyone.
[01:04:03.849 --> 01:04:06.810]  I mean, she is a babbling buffoon, too.
[01:04:07.731 --> 01:04:10.172]  She said, you know, we're going to turn the whole country red.
[01:04:10.192 --> 01:04:12.352]  We're going to take it back from the Republicans.
[01:04:12.372 --> 01:04:13.773]  And I know you're a red at heart, lady.
[01:04:14.653 --> 01:04:16.154]  Everything they're doing.
[01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:16.934]  You're a TV viewer.
[01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:17.454]  You can see this.
[01:04:17.634 --> 01:04:17.894]  Stop.
[01:04:17.955 --> 01:04:18.695]  It's too insane.
[01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:21.016]  I mean, she really does look completely insane.
[01:04:21.796 --> 01:04:21.896]  And $100,000.
[01:04:25.558 --> 01:04:46.603]  To Alexandria Cortez, if she will go over the El Paso border, go into Mexico, and then not hang out in a little hotel or a rat shack or whatever, I want you to walk into the scrub brush, six miles, round trip, and let me tell you,
[01:04:48.308 --> 01:04:51.010]  There's not a very good chance you don't get kidnapped.
[01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:57.674]  And not a good chance that some of the folks you want to open the border up to do some really bad things to you.
[01:04:57.714 --> 01:04:58.715]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[01:04:59.456 --> 01:05:00.276]  Hell, go to Somalia.
[01:05:00.316 --> 01:05:01.177]  You'd like that even more.
[01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:07.240]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:07.781]  Go ahead.
[01:05:08.021 --> 01:05:13.605]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:05:13.806 --> 01:05:14.907]  I'd done the War Room.
[01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:17.669]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:05:17.689 --> 01:05:19.250]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:19.910]  I was exhausted.
[01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:23.493]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[01:05:23.854 --> 01:05:28.497]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[01:05:28.577 --> 01:05:30.599]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:05:30.659 --> 01:05:31.400]  The same thing.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.401]  It's been a full day here at InfoWars.
[01:05:33.481 --> 01:05:34.722]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:05:34.882 --> 01:05:36.983]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:05:37.003 --> 01:05:43.007]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:05:43.287 --> 01:05:44.067]  You can sleep with it.
[01:05:44.448 --> 01:05:48.750]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:51.612]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:05:51.752 --> 01:05:53.453]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:05:53.593 --> 01:05:54.274]  It really works.
[01:05:54.514 --> 01:05:59.076]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[01:05:59.477 --> 01:06:01.618]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods, believe me.
[01:06:06.326 --> 01:06:10.287]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:06:11.248 --> 01:06:15.129]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:32.415]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.816]  And Random Tatum is a great patriot.
[01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:43.756]  Police officer, SWAT officer, you name it, now working with the Turning Point USA folks and Candace Owens and others are doing a great job.
[01:06:44.077 --> 01:06:46.499]  Facebook.com forward slash TatumBug34.
[01:06:46.699 --> 01:06:50.342]  YouTube.com forward slash BTCruiser34.
[01:06:50.383 --> 01:06:53.065]  He's reached hundreds and hundreds of millions of people.
[01:06:54.667 --> 01:06:58.030]  Every one of his videos is getting 5, 10, 15, 20 million views until they shadowban him.
[01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:59.811]  Now they only get a half million, a million.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.602]  And that's, again, you out there handsharing him.
[01:07:02.682 --> 01:07:09.188]  But he's doing a great job going and speaking at universities about Americanism, capitalism, exceptionalism, and doing a great job.
[01:07:09.228 --> 01:07:11.090]  And I wanted to get him on, and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:07:12.051 --> 01:07:15.714]  Because what they do is, first they target Sean Hannity and try to get him fired and lie about him.
[01:07:16.015 --> 01:07:24.603]  Then they lie about me with Sandy Hook and other stuff and take it out of context and say Alex Jones is bullying kids and doing things I haven't done.
[01:07:25.555 --> 01:07:28.016]  And then everybody else gets bullied into going along with it.
[01:07:28.457 --> 01:07:42.604]  And that's why, you know, folks have been leaving Fox News, who are patriots, is that even Fox News has put major pressure on people behind the scenes to abandon Rush Limbaugh, even, to abandon Sean Hannity, to abandon Tucker Carlson.
[01:07:42.624 --> 01:07:43.765]  And those people get told.
[01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:47.247]  They get told, you better watch what you say and do.
[01:07:47.267 --> 01:07:53.050]  And my point in getting into that is that, and Guilfoyle leaving, and I know the inside baseball on that,
[01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:57.624]  Is that they're making a move on everybody right now.
[01:07:57.644 --> 01:07:59.925]  And everybody's saying, oh, well, we just take Alex Jones down.
[01:07:59.945 --> 01:08:03.127]  You know, let's take him off for hate speech on YouTube or Facebook or Spotify.
[01:08:03.928 --> 01:08:05.449]  They never say what I was taken down for.
[01:08:05.489 --> 01:08:08.711]  They say he beat up a child, Forbes said.
[01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:14.454]  They don't show where it was, how it happened, like any other report would always say, at the corner of this and that.
[01:08:14.514 --> 01:08:15.675]  Mr. Jones reportedly did this.
[01:08:15.695 --> 01:08:19.817]  They just say, he had some hate video where he chokes a kid and throws him to the ground.
[01:08:20.438 --> 01:08:24.260]  No, it was a kid in another state beating people up, hitting adults, and the adult pushes him down.
[01:08:25.985 --> 01:08:28.907]  And it's not me, and it was from ABC News, but it doesn't matter.
[01:08:29.848 --> 01:08:34.170]  They've taken down, they've blocked live streaming for us, and they say, one more thing, you're banned.
[01:08:34.351 --> 01:08:34.671]  Forever.
[01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:40.375]  So that's digital book burning, and now you see Congress people being shadow banned.
[01:08:40.435 --> 01:08:42.836]  The President already is shadow banned on Twitter.
[01:08:42.896 --> 01:08:44.357]  He's got hundreds of millions of followers.
[01:08:44.377 --> 01:08:46.318]  They only let him get like 100,000 people that see it.
[01:08:46.619 --> 01:08:48.160]  You have to go to the President's site.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.082]  So Brandon Tatum's gonna ride shotgun with us for the hour to go over all of this.
[01:08:52.102 --> 01:08:54.224]  I'm gonna play some clips from the morning job.
[01:08:55.521 --> 01:09:03.087]  And other places where they are, again, saying that I'm suing the Sandy Hook parents.
[01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:04.608]  No, they're suing me.
[01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:14.275]  And when you sue somebody in Texas, it triggers the law that if you lose when you file the suit, you've got to pay attorney's fees unless the party being sued waives them.
[01:09:15.015 --> 01:09:19.779]  I waived them to take the high road and they said that I sued them.
[01:09:20.699 --> 01:09:22.220]  That's next level deception.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.022]  And then get to watch Mr. Hemmer.
[01:09:25.177 --> 01:09:26.919]  It's told that on the show by the Democrat.
[01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:27.940]  He believes it.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.322]  We have to stop believing these people.
[01:09:30.362 --> 01:09:33.665]  You have to demand to see the video or the article.
[01:09:33.905 --> 01:09:35.887]  Brandon Tatum, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:36.067 --> 01:09:39.229]  I plugged Twitter and YouTube, but you're censored more and more.
[01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:42.933]  Where's the best place for people to go find you where you can't be censored?
[01:09:46.624 --> 01:09:47.205]  Let me see.
[01:09:47.465 --> 01:09:48.786]  I guess I'm censored everywhere right now.
[01:09:48.826 --> 01:09:51.728]  I'm developing my website to try to get a more efficient website.
[01:09:52.248 --> 01:10:01.015]  But I guess, you know, my Facebook is going to be a go-to thing right now or YouTube, where you can see all of my videos and on those two websites.
[01:10:02.476 --> 01:10:09.803]  We're trying to develop an avenue where people can go and click through and find specific places to follow and all the information that they need.
[01:10:09.843 --> 01:10:16.870]  So, we're in a development period, but once we get it all done, BrandonOltatum.com will be the go-to website.
[01:10:17.945 --> 01:10:25.853]  And again, as Drudge said here two years ago in studio, it's time for all of us to move out of these electronic ghettos of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and have our own thing.
[01:10:25.893 --> 01:10:37.143]  It's hard, it's expensive, everybody can't do it, but letting them get control of 90% of the web, which they have, really has given them almost checkmate power, and I think Congress needs to start moving against this.
[01:10:37.183 --> 01:10:37.584]  What do you think?
[01:10:38.891 --> 01:10:39.351]  No, I agree 100%.
[01:10:39.511 --> 01:10:41.191]  I mean, they're censoring our speech.
[01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:49.213]  I mean, the people who need quality information from shows like this, from things that we put out on our social media, they're not getting access to this stuff.
[01:10:49.533 --> 01:10:58.654]  And it's shameful, and it's hurtful to the American people, because on one end, you have fake news, CNN, and these other places that will literally lie to our faces.
[01:10:58.934 --> 01:11:00.015]  We cannot trust them.
[01:11:00.455 --> 01:11:07.976]  And then when we put out quality stuff with information that is backed empirically, all of these different sources and stuff like that, especially your show,
[01:11:08.877 --> 01:11:09.978]  People aren't having access.
[01:11:10.098 --> 01:11:13.482]  People tell me all day long, well Brandon, I don't get notifications anymore.
[01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:15.103]  I can't see any of your material.
[01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:16.325]  They're banning you.
[01:11:16.565 --> 01:11:26.156]  I had a person send me a screenshot of, I can't remember was it a live stream or not, but it was removed from their page because it was considered spam.
[01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:31.660]  And all I was doing on the video was talking about being a victor, not being a victim.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.922]  It's being inspired and believing in yourself.
[01:11:33.962 --> 01:11:44.871]  So, I mean, these people are censoring us, and I think that we have to go beyond the social media websites, and that's why I'm trying to develop a more, I guess, active page, active
[01:11:45.826 --> 01:11:46.787]  Well, here's an example.
[01:11:46.807 --> 01:11:48.749]  I did a video this morning and said, go to the record.
[01:11:48.789 --> 01:11:49.529]  We waived attorney's fees.
[01:11:49.549 --> 01:11:50.150]  No one ever does that.
[01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:52.351]  The media was all there at the Sandy Hook lawsuit yesterday in Austin.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:18.382]  And people sent me screenshots where they put out a notice saying that I'm fake news and that I am suing the Sandy Hook parents.
[01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:21.483]  I mean, they put that on my video.
[01:12:21.523 --> 01:12:23.943]  That's somebody retweeting what happened.
[01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:25.764]  They did the same thing on Paul Watson.
[01:12:25.784 --> 01:12:27.084]  Scroll down and show TV viewers that.
[01:12:27.464 --> 01:12:31.365]  He put a UN document about wanting 600 million migrants in the U.S.
[01:12:32.145 --> 01:12:36.330]  Officially from the UN, and when you go to PolitiFact, they don't deny it.
[01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:41.437]  They just say, well, it's false and misleading because he uses the term revealed.
[01:12:41.477 --> 01:12:43.299]  Well, no one knew about this until Paul found it.
[01:12:43.619 --> 01:12:45.081]  I mean, Macron said the same thing.
[01:12:45.141 --> 01:12:49.307]  So, this is just crazy how these so-called fact-checkers, they're the frauds.
[01:12:50.737 --> 01:12:52.538]  Right, and it's just like the Nazis would do.
[01:12:52.578 --> 01:13:06.783]  They take and burn books, rewrite history, and they're literally doing this, and this is not, they're not using actual fires, they're not burning actual books, but what they're doing is being deceptive on one of the biggest platforms that have the most influence.
[01:13:07.063 --> 01:13:15.667]  They're censoring our stuff and they're burning, essentially, the books of information that we have, and then they're repackaging them as truth, and they're lying to the American people.
[01:13:15.927 --> 01:13:19.368]  And I think people have to sit down and ask themselves, why are they doing this?
[01:13:20.074 --> 01:13:23.196]  Why in the world are they censoring your show?
[01:13:23.776 --> 01:13:26.917]  Your show is probably the most profound show that I've ever seen.
[01:13:27.338 --> 01:13:27.938]  I watched it.
[01:13:28.058 --> 01:13:29.138]  I got great information.
[01:13:29.399 --> 01:13:34.741]  And that's how I was able to understand what Donald Trump was doing, because the news, they were lying about it.
[01:13:34.901 --> 01:13:35.922]  The polls, they were lying.
[01:13:36.202 --> 01:13:37.423]  They were lying about his speeches.
[01:13:38.003 --> 01:13:40.344]  And this was one of the only shows that gave accurate truth.
[01:13:40.404 --> 01:13:46.167]  And not only accurate truth, but it projected into the future of realistic stuff that people could actually tangibly look forward to.
[01:13:46.907 --> 01:13:49.108]  And why do they want to censor this stuff?
[01:13:49.228 --> 01:13:51.109]  That is the proverbial question.
[01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.449]  Why?
[01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:53.390]  What are they trying to get at?
[01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:59.053]  And I think they're trying to get at control, like the Nazis were doing, like the Democrats were doing back in the day.
[01:13:59.554 --> 01:14:05.777]  They were using, you know, the KKK, and they were trying to control America and make it the America that they wanted to be.
[01:14:06.237 --> 01:14:07.157]  And we're not having that.
[01:14:07.177 --> 01:14:08.338]  That's why we're voting for Barack.
[01:14:08.378 --> 01:14:08.578]  Exactly.
[01:14:08.598 --> 01:14:09.278]  Take Jim Acosta.
[01:14:09.298 --> 01:14:10.059]  There's a clip of this.
[01:14:10.519 --> 01:14:11.480]  We'll probably play it later.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.301]  He's being booed.
[01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:13.061]  Everybody's seen that.
[01:14:13.562 --> 01:14:15.523]  But then he goes, I'm fact-checking you.
[01:14:15.804 --> 01:14:17.025]  We're not fake news.
[01:14:17.205 --> 01:14:18.286]  He goes, I'm God.
[01:14:18.786 --> 01:14:21.569]  I don't care if you all think we're fake and are booing me, which is your right.
[01:14:21.869 --> 01:14:26.233]  You're all violent, and you're going to cause Trump to get somebody hurt when it's the Democrats calling for violence.
[01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.535]  So it's just them saying CNN sucks and booing them.
[01:14:29.335 --> 01:14:30.716]  Their free speech is now bad.
[01:14:30.937 --> 01:14:32.858]  And then he goes, I am fact-checking you.
[01:14:33.299 --> 01:14:34.239]  You are fake news.
[01:14:35.277 --> 01:14:39.820]  It's just like Cuomo on, they're saying, you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks, only I'm allowed.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:47.764]  So, he magic wands and says that, oh, a crowd telling us they don't like us, you're fake, you don't exist, what you say doesn't matter.
[01:14:47.944 --> 01:14:48.824]  This is crazy!
[01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:53.207]  I love what Sarah Sanders said at the press briefing.
[01:14:53.547 --> 01:14:57.129]  She said, we not only accept the freedom of press, but the freedom of speech.
[01:14:57.469 --> 01:15:00.050]  And these people genuinely believe that it's fake news.
[01:15:00.331 --> 01:15:02.792]  And I don't think that it's just an opinion, I think it's facts.
[01:15:03.394 --> 01:15:09.123]  CNN has been caught several times doctoring documents, lying about people, using fake sources.
[01:15:15.054 --> 01:15:16.355]  I mean, they act like it don't exist.
[01:15:16.375 --> 01:15:20.257]  They act like we're too stupid to look at any of these things that have been public record.
[01:15:20.518 --> 01:15:21.158]  They lied!
[01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:24.420]  There's people on TV admitting to giving Hillary Clinton questions.
[01:15:24.961 --> 01:15:26.001]  What can they say?
[01:15:26.241 --> 01:15:27.122]  They are fake news.
[01:15:27.162 --> 01:15:27.963]  They are liars.
[01:15:28.363 --> 01:15:29.884]  They are deceiving the American people.
[01:15:29.904 --> 01:15:34.447]  Well, I mean, it's like Acosta and all them saying Trump took out the Martin Luther King bust.
[01:15:34.727 --> 01:15:37.129]  When they was right there, or saying, what was the other one they said?
[01:15:37.389 --> 01:15:39.130]  That he didn't visit Congressman Scalise.
[01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.911]  All of it!
[01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:43.073]  I mean, they just lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[01:15:43.093 --> 01:15:45.314]  And now they say, I've got to be taken off air.
[01:15:45.334 --> 01:15:48.516]  And if they can just set the precedent to take me off, we'll all be safe.
[01:15:49.037 --> 01:15:50.338]  Brandon Tatum is our guest.
[01:15:50.358 --> 01:15:52.659]  He's doing a great job exposing all this.
[01:15:52.679 --> 01:15:56.682]  We'll talk more about some of the big issues facing America and the world straight ahead.
[01:15:56.702 --> 01:15:58.943]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:15:58.963 --> 01:15:59.864]  Please spread those links.
[01:15:59.924 --> 01:16:01.105]  It makes Soros really mad.
[01:16:04.904 --> 01:16:18.479]  There is not a single case of a murder journalist that is proven to be killed by state-related people, especially by people related to the president of the country.
[01:16:18.519 --> 01:16:24.826]  Your audience must understand that we in Russia have more freedom of speech than any Western country now has.
[01:16:25.066 --> 01:16:32.671]  And a journalist that always has been, for 10 years, has been a flagrant opposition speaker, he went to Ukraine.
[01:16:32.831 --> 01:16:35.432]  And this person fakes his own death.
[01:16:35.552 --> 01:16:40.675]  And then says, well, that's Russia, that Putin and Ukrainian special services saved me.
[01:16:40.815 --> 01:16:46.619]  Well, you know, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes, you don't need to be a genius to understand that this is some kind of
[01:16:47.339 --> 01:16:48.340]  We're good to go.
[01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:12.253]  A special service officer from Russia who went to Great Britain and sold all the secrets he knew.
[01:17:12.273 --> 01:17:20.217]  He sold information about our special agents in Great Britain and he betrayed his country, his motherland.
[01:17:20.317 --> 01:17:24.899]  He's not an officer anymore if we talk about things like honor.
[01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:28.560]  After he came to Great Britain, he lived for 10 years there.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.621]  And then, suddenly, he is poised.
[01:17:30.801 --> 01:17:32.781]  Every crime needs to have a motive.
[01:17:33.022 --> 01:17:42.365]  What is the motive for Russia to poison a defector that sold all the secrets many years ago and for 10 years has been living in Great Britain with no connection to Russia?
[01:17:42.605 --> 01:17:46.706]  What's the motive of doing this on the eve of presidential elections?
[01:17:47.046 --> 01:17:48.547]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[01:17:48.587 --> 01:17:54.850]  Let's understand that no one likes traitors, even those who benefited from their treachery.
[01:17:55.051 --> 01:17:57.712]  So Mr. Skripal made his choice.
[01:17:57.872 --> 01:17:59.093]  He betrayed his country.
[01:17:59.173 --> 01:18:02.375]  He betrayed his honor as an officer of a special service.
[01:18:02.575 --> 01:18:07.918]  He betrayed his colleagues who got into trouble because of his defection.
[01:18:08.118 --> 01:18:15.762]  But Britain, after letting him in, wouldn't be happy just having this person on welfare forever.
[01:18:15.982 --> 01:18:18.184]  For his one episode of being useful.
[01:18:18.304 --> 01:18:26.211]  So of course, I think that they didn't stop using him and squeezing all the other information he could probably possess.
[01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:30.375]  But after that, I think they decided to use him in this kind of provocation.
[01:18:30.475 --> 01:18:32.317]  Because the timing of this provocation
[01:18:32.837 --> 01:18:39.739]  Right on the election in Russia shows that it was well prepared and planned long time ago.
[01:18:39.839 --> 01:18:44.560]  It's a typical, you know, style of British special services.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.581]  Another style of British special services is poisoning.
[01:18:47.641 --> 01:18:53.082]  You know, I've talked to a lot of specialists and historians of special services
[01:18:53.722 --> 01:19:03.630]  And they said that Russians, we don't usually poison people throughout our history, but poisoning is not Russian style.
[01:19:03.931 --> 01:19:12.758]  So I think that what happened is that some kind of MI6 operatives asked Skripal to take his daughter to a place to meet and to discuss something.
[01:19:13.198 --> 01:19:20.924]  Skripal took his daughter, they were waiting in the street, and then someone sprayed some kind of agent that would poison but not kill them.
[01:19:21.044 --> 01:19:23.526]  And after that, we saw all these scenarios.
[01:19:23.607 --> 01:19:37.578]  So after all this situation, we saw his daughter Julia Skripal appear on cameras, and we saw traces of tracheotomy on her neck here.
[01:19:38.138 --> 01:19:49.701]  That shows that she has undergone some kind of medication, some kind of surgery, and regarding her maybe lungs or tracheal bronchus.
[01:19:49.781 --> 01:19:59.164]  So that's why I think that she probably was poisoned or exposed to some kind of chemical that could harm her.
[01:20:06.363 --> 01:20:09.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.025 --> 01:20:09.386]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:09.426 --> 01:20:10.206]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.226 --> 01:20:14.470]  You know what?
[01:20:27.472 --> 01:20:32.933]  Brandon Tatum and I are brothers, even though we've never met in person, is because we're Christians.
[01:20:33.474 --> 01:20:36.574]  And I don't say that up on some high horse that I'm some perfect guy, I'm a sinner.
[01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:49.378]  But in every culture, in every society, you can have a group of Asians, a group of whites, a group of Africans, whatever group it is, and the group that's really Christian will be ten times more productive.
[01:20:50.138 --> 01:20:56.400]  Whether it's in Rwanda, or whether it's in Romania, or whether it's in Paraguay,
[01:20:57.461 --> 01:20:58.461]  It's well-known.
[01:21:00.382 --> 01:21:01.962]  Everybody else just can't get it together.
[01:21:03.303 --> 01:21:11.985]  And so, it's Christianity that gets us past tribalism and the New Testament, because the whole Old Testament is everybody killing each other over their tribe.
[01:21:13.726 --> 01:21:15.286]  Even people that were genetically almost the same.
[01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:17.046]  It's a whole history of that.
[01:21:19.487 --> 01:21:24.629]  And Christianity is where you say, no, I have a set of values, I believe in God, the same God,
[01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:28.865]  And so, that's what unifies us.
[01:21:29.966 --> 01:21:33.869]  And we transcend being tribal idiots to the next level, like Martin Luther King talked about.
[01:21:34.129 --> 01:21:40.073]  But you look at what the left pushes, it's diametrically opposed to Martin Luther King.
[01:21:40.654 --> 01:21:40.073]  100% 180.
[01:21:41.354 --> 01:21:42.835]  Look at this article on Infowars.com.
[01:21:42.855 --> 01:21:43.396]  It's gone viral.
[01:21:44.536 --> 01:21:47.699]  I'm sure Snopes or PolitiFact will say it's fake, because it's her actual Twitter.
[01:21:48.719 --> 01:21:54.344]  New York Times new editorial board member celebrated dumb, ass-effing white people going extinct.
[01:21:54.984 --> 01:21:56.005]  And there's even worse tweets.
[01:21:57.438 --> 01:22:06.481]  She says, are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster than the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins?
[01:22:07.761 --> 01:22:08.241]  It goes on.
[01:22:08.901 --> 01:22:09.981]  Let's hear both sides.
[01:22:10.162 --> 01:22:13.843]  I mean, this sounds like stuff you'd read on Stormfront about Jews.
[01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:17.163]  Horrible, just absolute crap.
[01:22:17.904 --> 01:22:20.124]  But, oh, she's Asian, so it's okay.
[01:22:20.404 --> 01:22:23.285]  And then they'll go, Jones is anti-Asian, my sister's Korean adopted, nothing to do with Asians.
[01:22:23.525 --> 01:22:25.786]  Or talk about China being corrupt, that's the Communist Party.
[01:22:27.366 --> 01:22:28.507]  She says, I have the graphs.
[01:22:29.287 --> 01:22:31.969]  And then she has the stuff that whites stink and smell like dogs.
[01:22:32.009 --> 01:22:38.474]  I mean, this is literally, like, the worst KKK stuff from, like, the 30s, but turned around on white people.
[01:22:40.315 --> 01:22:44.678]  And then she goes on to say that it's inconvenient truths that, you know, whites are evil and need to go extinct.
[01:22:44.718 --> 01:22:46.460]  I mean, this is genocidal stuff.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:49.342]  White people have stopped breeding.
[01:22:49.562 --> 01:22:50.823]  You'll all go extinct soon.
[01:22:51.163 --> 01:22:52.544]  This was my plan all along.
[01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:54.863]  And then the devil sign.
[01:22:54.883 --> 01:23:02.127]  And again, this is the unifying factor at the universities and these crazy places where it's mainly weird white people.
[01:23:02.167 --> 01:23:05.569]  I'm not trying to bash whites, but weird liberals in all the videos who are giving me some muscle.
[01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:06.350]  No whites allowed.
[01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:10.612]  And it's a white woman saying it at Evergreen College or Missouri State.
[01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:18.297]  So joining us is Brandon Tatum, a patriot, a former SWAT team officer, police officer, now working with Turning Point, doing a great job, viral videos.
[01:23:18.317 --> 01:23:19.198]  We're getting into censorship.
[01:23:19.238 --> 01:23:20.979]  I did that little three-minute intro rant.
[01:23:21.339 --> 01:23:22.360]  That's just today.
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:26.043]  And I've got stacks of other articles.
[01:23:26.543 --> 01:23:29.907]  I mean, if you flip this around, this is like, this is Nazi.
[01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:33.170]  This is exactly what the real Nazis said.
[01:23:34.608 --> 01:23:38.390]  This is exactly, it just played out, repackaged, and put in the 2018.
[01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:48.316]  There is no way on planet Earth that what this young lady did would be acceptable if she said, remotely said, any of that about black people.
[01:23:48.636 --> 01:23:50.478]  It's not acceptable to say it about white people.
[01:23:50.678 --> 01:23:54.120]  But what I'm saying is the double standard that they have on the left.
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.281]  You can openly hate police officers.
[01:23:57.601 --> 01:24:04.323]  You can openly call for the death of police officers and hate white people as much as you want, as long as it's on the left.
[01:24:04.683 --> 01:24:08.024]  And what they do is they use propaganda to justify the hatred.
[01:24:08.424 --> 01:24:10.425]  They want to call us Nazis.
[01:24:10.505 --> 01:24:15.346]  They want to call us the racists so they can be then justified in hating us and wanting to kill us.
[01:24:15.866 --> 01:24:17.147]  And it's unacceptable.
[01:24:17.608 --> 01:24:24.192]  And these people are literally using brainwashing tactics to put people back on the proverbial plantation.
[01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:25.534]  Not just black people.
[01:24:25.754 --> 01:24:26.074]  Everybody.
[01:24:26.114 --> 01:24:27.055]  Not just white people.
[01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:27.795]  Everybody.
[01:24:27.835 --> 01:24:29.537]  They want everybody to be under their foot.
[01:24:29.837 --> 01:24:31.518]  They want to control everything at the top.
[01:24:31.958 --> 01:24:33.179]  And they want us subject to that.
[01:24:33.439 --> 01:24:34.961]  It's the same thing that the Nazis did.
[01:24:35.241 --> 01:24:37.903]  It's the exact same thing being played out in America today.
[01:24:38.003 --> 01:24:39.004]  Melvin, I've got to do a correction.
[01:24:39.044 --> 01:24:39.964]  Everything becomes a blurb.
[01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:41.846]  When this stuff's going on.
[01:24:41.866 --> 01:24:44.808]  But of course you have met, you have been in studio.
[01:24:45.088 --> 01:24:47.030]  I met before you were ever here in studio.
[01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:51.013]  We click, just like with Trump clicking.
[01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:53.895]  We know America was an unstoppable engine.
[01:24:54.075 --> 01:24:58.278]  I read the CFR reports 30 years ago about we've got to make Americans poorer so we control them.
[01:24:58.499 --> 01:25:00.020]  Hell, Bill Maher says it on TV now.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:02.222]  So I'm not trying to take away Trump's thunder.
[01:25:02.542 --> 01:25:03.923]  He's done a great job and has courage.
[01:25:04.343 --> 01:25:06.365]  That's his real thing is having the courage to be persecuted.
[01:25:06.565 --> 01:25:07.546]  But all he had to do was
[01:25:08.086 --> 01:25:08.546]  I don't know.
[01:25:08.586 --> 01:25:08.967]  I don't know.
[01:25:32.097 --> 01:25:34.098]  Make drastic drastic measures.
[01:25:34.798 --> 01:25:38.479]  They're losing miserably, you know, everybody's waking up.
[01:25:38.959 --> 01:25:40.780]  You see the huge walk away movement.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.301]  That is a that is a movement of all people.
[01:25:43.621 --> 01:25:50.563]  Then you have a lot of African Americans who have been brainwashed for years walking away from the Democratic Party and opening their eyes to reality and truth.
[01:25:50.843 --> 01:25:55.905]  You have people like myself and Candace Owens who are going out and we're dedicated and there's a lot of others.
[01:25:55.965 --> 01:25:57.785]  I'm just speaking of people that I know personally.
[01:25:58.065 --> 01:25:59.606]  We're going out and we're
[01:25:59.966 --> 01:26:00.927]  We're informing people.
[01:26:00.967 --> 01:26:07.313]  We're giving them information, education, and inspiration that they can go and then disciple other people to come to reality.
[01:26:07.333 --> 01:26:09.855]  We're getting unplugged from the matrix, man.
[01:26:10.335 --> 01:26:14.339]  And they have to do crazy stuff, censor us on social media.
[01:26:14.679 --> 01:26:19.303]  I wouldn't even be shocked if they wouldn't actually come after us and try to attack us physically.
[01:26:19.584 --> 01:26:23.767]  You see them pulling off Trump hacks, shooting people at baseball games.
[01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:25.349]  I mean, they're just going
[01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:26.710]  Crazy mad.
[01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:32.814]  Because if they don't go crazy mad, if they don't go extreme, they will lose miserably and be vanished from the earth.
[01:26:32.874 --> 01:26:34.255]  And I'm not saying physically vanished.
[01:26:34.515 --> 01:26:36.496]  I'm saying their ideology will be vanished.
[01:26:36.536 --> 01:26:36.856]  Exactly.
[01:26:36.876 --> 01:26:38.277]  Their ideology is dying.
[01:26:38.317 --> 01:26:41.339]  Like I said, I'm going to have a showdown with Mueller ideologically, politically.
[01:26:41.619 --> 01:26:44.741]  We're going to win the shootout, like the Red River shootout, OU versus UT.
[01:26:44.821 --> 01:26:45.922]  It doesn't mean I'm going to shoot him.
[01:26:46.362 --> 01:26:47.123]  Everybody knows that.
[01:26:47.183 --> 01:26:47.943]  That's how they spin it.
[01:26:49.244 --> 01:27:15.643]  One reason I want to get you on, and I won't play the clips, because if we play them, they say community guidelines and ban us off Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, even though it's been on local news, even though liberal news had to admit in Portland and San Francisco and everywhere, they're attacking food trucks owned by Hispanic people, Asians, if they serve anyone coming out of the ICE office, and they're calling them N-words everywhere, and then we have these videos out at the Hollywood Star where they were calling the beautiful Joy
[01:27:16.443 --> 01:27:17.565]  I don't know.
[01:27:35.683 --> 01:27:36.543]  Yeah, they can't.
[01:27:36.744 --> 01:27:37.704]  We're revealing the truth.
[01:27:37.764 --> 01:27:38.985]  We're giving it context.
[01:27:39.445 --> 01:27:40.325]  They can't have that.
[01:27:40.605 --> 01:27:43.767]  They need it to be played out of context and they need to be able to twist it the way they want to.
[01:27:44.627 --> 01:27:47.869]  These people are not picking a group.
[01:27:47.909 --> 01:27:48.969]  They hate everybody.
[01:27:49.689 --> 01:27:51.290]  They hate black people.
[01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:52.911]  They hate Hispanic people.
[01:27:53.831 --> 01:27:56.332]  If you do not agree with them... They hate prosperity.
[01:27:56.452 --> 01:27:57.793]  They want total control.
[01:27:58.113 --> 01:27:58.573]  Exactly.
[01:27:58.813 --> 01:27:59.734]  And they want to kill you.
[01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:03.652]  I'm telling you, I think that some of these people want to actually kill you.
[01:28:03.692 --> 01:28:04.372]  They just can't.
[01:28:04.672 --> 01:28:06.233]  So they beat you to oblivion.
[01:28:06.554 --> 01:28:07.794]  They steal your property.
[01:28:08.194 --> 01:28:09.955]  They try to set your buildings on fire.
[01:28:10.176 --> 01:28:11.636]  They try to ruin your bank accounts.
[01:28:12.057 --> 01:28:12.637]  They do it all.
[01:28:12.657 --> 01:28:13.678]  They ruin your image.
[01:28:13.758 --> 01:28:15.218]  Look what they're doing with President Trump.
[01:28:15.539 --> 01:28:18.300]  They're trying to completely destroy him and his entire family.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.521]  They want him in prison.
[01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:26.694]  This is a real deal, and I think people are overlooking the mission that the media has and some of these people on the left have.
[01:28:27.114 --> 01:28:29.815]  Their mission is to destroy us, and we have to stand against it.
[01:28:29.875 --> 01:28:32.557]  And they've said that on my Twitter, on my Facebook.
[01:28:32.577 --> 01:28:33.398]  I should read more of these.
[01:28:33.418 --> 01:28:34.538]  They go, you're going to go bankrupt.
[01:28:34.558 --> 01:28:35.439]  We're going to destroy you.
[01:28:35.799 --> 01:28:36.539]  We're going to get you.
[01:28:36.559 --> 01:28:42.963]  I had people walk up in front of my kids and say, F your family, liberals, because they all have the same.
[01:28:43.003 --> 01:28:44.304]  And I had my kids taken, which I didn't.
[01:28:44.824 --> 01:28:46.405]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:28:46.425 --> 01:28:49.248]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:29:11.835 --> 01:29:12.936]  It just gets old, man.
[01:29:13.256 --> 01:29:14.978]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:29:15.699 --> 01:29:17.761]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:22.005]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:29:22.025 --> 01:29:24.507]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:29:25.308 --> 01:29:27.670]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:29.131]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:29:29.372 --> 01:29:30.253]  Us being shut down?
[01:29:30.493 --> 01:29:31.514]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:29:31.954 --> 01:29:32.995]  You know what, Alex?
[01:29:33.015 --> 01:29:34.115]  Put him on pause again.
[01:29:34.136 --> 01:29:34.976]  Hey, Frank!
[01:29:35.216 --> 01:29:40.600]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:45.183]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:29:45.423 --> 01:29:48.285]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:29:48.305 --> 01:29:48.925]  Do you understand?
[01:29:49.025 --> 01:29:50.286]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:29:50.666 --> 01:29:51.827]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:29:52.788 --> 01:29:57.691]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:29:58.652 --> 01:29:59.352]  Do you understand?
[01:29:59.372 --> 01:30:00.553]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:06.277]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:30:06.297 --> 01:30:09.561]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:30:10.082 --> 01:30:15.888]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:19.132]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:30:19.853 --> 01:30:23.318]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:30:23.678 --> 01:30:29.766]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:35.133]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:30:35.874 --> 01:30:39.256]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:30:39.796 --> 01:30:46.339]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.662]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:30:51.682 --> 01:30:57.325]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:30:57.905 --> 01:31:01.867]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:06.400]  They think you're a goldfish!
[01:31:08.021 --> 01:31:10.121]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[01:31:10.362 --> 01:31:11.442]  I believe in you!
[01:31:11.462 --> 01:31:13.002]  I don't think you're stupid!
[01:31:14.823 --> 01:31:17.644]  One man ever raped a woman!
[01:31:18.004 --> 01:31:19.604]  All genitals were cut off!
[01:31:19.844 --> 01:31:22.265]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[01:31:22.405 --> 01:31:23.625]  And we're not backing down on her!
[01:31:24.906 --> 01:31:26.666]  I want to kick these people!
[01:31:26.726 --> 01:31:27.246]  We're winning!
[01:31:27.286 --> 01:31:28.387]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[01:31:28.547 --> 01:31:29.007]  Can't you?
[01:31:29.307 --> 01:31:30.947]  We have broken their back!
[01:31:31.308 --> 01:31:32.408]  Yes, I can feel it!
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:36.620]  Let's go!
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:36.920]  Come on!
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:37.280]  Come on!
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.021]  Come on!

[01:31:40.421 --> 01:31:40.641]  Come on!
[01:31:40.741 --> 01:31:41.101]  Come on!

[01:31:42.302 --> 01:31:42.482]  Come on!
[01:31:42.502 --> 01:31:42.722]  Come on!
[01:31:42.742 --> 01:31:42.902]  Come on!
[01:31:42.922 --> 01:31:43.162]  Come on!
[01:31:43.262 --> 01:31:43.442]  Come on!

[01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:50.224]  Come on!
[01:31:50.244 --> 01:31:50.484]  Come on!
[01:31:50.604 --> 01:31:50.764]  Come on!
[01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:51.305]  Come on!
[01:31:51.325 --> 01:31:51.585]  Come on!
[01:31:51.705 --> 01:31:51.925]  Come on!
[01:31:51.945 --> 01:31:52.245]  Come on!
[01:31:52.265 --> 01:31:52.485]  Come on!
[01:31:52.505 --> 01:31:52.685]  Come on!
[01:31:52.705 --> 01:31:52.905]  Come on!
[01:31:52.925 --> 01:31:53.165]  Come on!
[01:31:53.185 --> 01:31:53.325]  Come on!
[01:31:53.345 --> 01:31:53.565]  Come on!
[01:31:53.585 --> 01:31:53.865]  Come on!
[01:31:53.885 --> 01:31:54.105]  Come on!
[01:31:54.145 --> 01:31:54.406]  Come on!
[01:31:54.526 --> 01:31:54.766]  Come on!
[01:31:54.786 --> 01:31:54.926]  Come on!
[01:31:54.946 --> 01:31:55.386]  Come on!
[01:31:55.426 --> 01:31:55.706]  Come on!
[01:31:55.806 --> 01:31:56.066]  Come on!
[01:31:56.106 --> 01:31:56.306]  Come on!
[01:31:56.326 --> 01:31:56.506]  Come on!
[01:31:56.546 --> 01:31:56.826]  Come on!
[01:31:56.846 --> 01:31:57.066]  Come on!
[01:31:57.086 --> 01:31:57.366]  Come on!
[01:31:57.426 --> 01:31:57.627]  Come on!
[01:31:57.647 --> 01:31:57.827]  Come on!
[01:31:57.847 --> 01:31:58.067]  Come on!
[01:31:58.167 --> 01:31:58.487]  Come on!
[01:31:58.507 --> 01:31:58.647]  Come on!
[01:31:58.667 --> 01:31:58.767]  Come
[01:32:02.609 --> 01:32:03.090]  Look at that.
[01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:05.795]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[01:32:05.855 --> 01:32:07.218]  That's because it's been denatured.
[01:32:07.258 --> 01:32:08.039]  It's been watered down.
[01:32:08.059 --> 01:32:09.121]  We didn't do that.
[01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:14.960]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.041]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:32:17.641 --> 01:32:26.164]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:32:26.644 --> 01:32:28.324]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:32:28.364 --> 01:32:29.485]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:32:30.165 --> 01:32:32.685]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:32:32.725 --> 01:32:33.826]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:32:34.586 --> 01:32:37.507]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:32:45.089 --> 01:32:45.429]  Look it up.
[01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:47.031]  Find out.
[01:32:47.051 --> 01:32:52.556]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[01:32:52.596 --> 01:32:57.440]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[01:32:57.921 --> 01:33:01.104]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[01:33:05.888 --> 01:33:08.511]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.874 --> 01:33:15.317]  We are drugged out!
[01:33:15.958 --> 01:33:18.202]  We are following other people's opinions!
[01:33:19.366 --> 01:33:21.648]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:33:22.188 --> 01:33:23.749]  Today, it all changes.
[01:33:24.049 --> 01:33:26.571]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:33:26.811 --> 01:33:29.652]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:33:29.873 --> 01:33:34.375]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:33:34.636 --> 01:33:37.417]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[01:33:37.457 --> 01:33:39.819]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:33:40.139 --> 01:33:42.080]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:44.021]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:33:44.201 --> 01:33:45.782]  We have the resources for a
[01:33:48.203 --> 01:33:52.166]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[01:33:52.186 --> 01:33:53.567]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[01:33:53.767 --> 01:33:55.348]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:33:55.368 --> 01:33:56.249]  They say Trump's crazy.
[01:33:56.449 --> 01:33:57.349]  They say I'm crazy.
[01:33:57.529 --> 01:33:59.751]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:33:59.911 --> 01:34:03.614]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:34:05.075 --> 01:34:08.617]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:09.197 --> 01:34:10.979]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:21.275 --> 01:34:29.883]  Alright, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:32.386 --> 01:34:34.928]  Brandon Tatum, great patriot, great spirit.
[01:34:35.929 --> 01:34:37.891]  He should be joining us in a moment, his Skype dropped.
[01:34:39.352 --> 01:34:45.138]  Mark Rondazza, who is one of my lawyers, and is recognized as one of the top free speech lawyers in the country.
[01:34:46.923 --> 01:34:49.285]  Is share with me, and we had a big powwow last night.
[01:34:49.325 --> 01:34:57.351]  I'm not going to get too much inside baseball here on air, but you were there when we said $1 attorney's fees.
[01:34:57.371 --> 01:34:58.532]  Because we can't waive our right.
[01:34:58.852 --> 01:35:00.133]  It comes through the state law.
[01:35:01.274 --> 01:35:01.815]  It's state law.
[01:35:01.895 --> 01:35:06.198]  If somebody sues you for defamation, then it triggers that the judge could give attorney's fees or whatever.
[01:35:06.678 --> 01:35:08.540]  The media spun out that I was suing them.
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:09.481]  You're a lawyer.
[01:35:09.581 --> 01:35:11.642]  You can explain, because you were in the court yesterday.
[01:35:12.143 --> 01:35:12.943]  Not as my lawyer.
[01:35:12.983 --> 01:35:14.945]  That's Enoch, Mark Enoch, whose brother's
[01:35:15.345 --> 01:35:15.445]  Yeah.
[01:35:32.851 --> 01:35:37.472]  If someone sues you for defamation, it could be up to $100,000 in attorney's fees if they lose.
[01:35:37.492 --> 01:35:38.213]  The judge decides.
[01:35:38.253 --> 01:35:38.973]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:35:39.253 --> 01:35:39.793]  Not exactly.
[01:35:39.833 --> 01:35:40.433]  Okay, well explain.
[01:35:40.453 --> 01:35:44.374]  The point is, we went and waived it all, the media's all there, and none of them reported it.
[01:35:44.574 --> 01:35:46.515]  Instead they said, he's suing the poor people!
[01:35:46.815 --> 01:35:47.175]  Right.
[01:35:47.515 --> 01:35:50.836]  How an anti-SLAPP law works is we have the American Rule.
[01:35:51.276 --> 01:35:56.638]  The American Rule means that if there's a lawsuit, both parties typically
[01:35:57.338 --> 01:35:58.759]  Bear their own costs and fees.
[01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:02.842]  Unlike Europe, where if you sue somebody and you lose, you have to pay their attorney's fees.
[01:36:03.442 --> 01:36:09.106]  Now what that creates is this perverse incentive if somebody wants to shut you down for exercising your First Amendment rights.
[01:36:09.566 --> 01:36:10.727]  The process is the punishment.
[01:36:11.107 --> 01:36:15.410]  You just sue the hell out of somebody, and hey, on the eve of trial, you drop it.
[01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:16.931]  Or, so what if you lose?
[01:36:17.051 --> 01:36:20.173]  Because if you've buried them in attorney's fees, you've done the job.
[01:36:20.353 --> 01:36:23.115]  Well, recognizing that that was a threat to free speech,
[01:36:23.735 --> 01:36:27.621]  Certain states, starting with California, started passing anti-slap laws.
[01:36:28.101 --> 01:36:39.258]  And an anti-slap law allows you to take a First Amendment case, end it early, you file a special motion, then that case has to be decided right away on what's in the record at that time.
[01:36:40.459 --> 01:36:43.781]  If the defendant wins, the defendant gets their attorney's fees back.
[01:36:44.041 --> 01:36:47.042]  So California passed one, Oregon, Washington.
[01:36:47.803 --> 01:36:50.224]  I was instrumental in getting one passed in Nevada.
[01:36:50.564 --> 01:36:55.346]  I've been working on one for Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas passed a pretty powerful one as well.
[01:36:55.706 --> 01:36:57.367]  There is no $100,000 limit.
[01:36:57.547 --> 01:37:02.730]  In fact, Texas, you not only get your attorney's fees, but the court can also issue sanctions.
[01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:07.652]  I mean, there was a case here about two years ago where somebody got a million dollars in sanctions.
[01:37:07.672 --> 01:37:09.333]  And let's be clear, no one waives that.
[01:37:10.073 --> 01:37:21.259]  I have never seen before, in the history of an anti-slap case, where a defendant invoked the anti-slap law, but then specifically waived their right to fees.
[01:37:21.479 --> 01:37:23.360]  Now you've done that here in Texas.
[01:37:23.841 --> 01:37:28.423]  You did that openly yesterday, and also in the Connecticut case that I'm handling for you.
[01:37:28.823 --> 01:37:30.084]  We put that in our briefing.
[01:37:30.925 --> 01:37:32.405]  And you think that would be news?
[01:37:32.505 --> 01:37:35.207]  No, instead, I'm suing the Sandy Hook parents.
[01:37:35.767 --> 01:37:36.327]  Oh, that's right.
[01:37:36.628 --> 01:37:39.049]  Oh my God, that's two, three weeks ago, the Connecticut briefing.
[01:37:39.209 --> 01:37:39.389]  Yes.
[01:37:39.409 --> 01:37:40.130]  That I waived it.
[01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:43.551]  Oh, and I bet they're going to say I'm suing them with that suit in Connecticut, too.
[01:37:43.652 --> 01:37:49.995]  Well, that's... God, this is just... That's the dishonesty in the reporting, I think, you know, that people are saying you're suing them for $100,000.
[01:37:50.095 --> 01:37:52.176]  You're not suing them for anything.
[01:37:52.256 --> 01:37:53.177]  You're the defendant.
[01:37:53.317 --> 01:37:54.918]  So that's not how lawsuits work.
[01:37:55.398 --> 01:37:59.661]  And anybody who's covered... It's like they come up and punch me in the head or hit me in the head with a tire iron.
[01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:04.884]  I go, I won't even block it, do it again, and they go, he just hit me with a tire iron!
[01:38:04.924 --> 01:38:07.125]  Yeah, it's more like you're hitting the tire iron with your face.
[01:38:07.845 --> 01:38:23.154]  So, in waiving those fees, what you've done is, in this case, you have invoked the anti-slap law to end the case early, but you have not taken advantage of, and you've actually waived one of the key benefits, which is the money.
[01:38:23.434 --> 01:38:27.417]  And I think that was a good idea, because nobody wants to
[01:38:28.177 --> 01:38:29.318]  These people lost their kids.
[01:38:29.578 --> 01:38:30.479]  You advised me to do it.
[01:38:30.519 --> 01:38:31.439]  Some of the other lawyers didn't.
[01:38:31.479 --> 01:38:32.700]  They just said, but, uh, yeah.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.561]  Well, let's not talk about what I advise you.
[01:38:34.581 --> 01:38:35.362]  You can't get into it.
[01:38:35.762 --> 01:38:38.544]  But I'll just say it's a, I think it's a good idea.
[01:38:38.744 --> 01:38:41.246]  But I was told by others, they said, watch, they're not going to report it.
[01:38:41.466 --> 01:38:48.991]  In fact, you were in the courtroom, Enoch said, when they said, Mr. Jones waives the attorney's fees, but so we can still keep the anti-slap right to get it dismissed quicker.
[01:38:49.271 --> 01:38:49.852]  That's the law.
[01:38:50.312 --> 01:38:50.832]  One dollar.
[01:38:51.172 --> 01:38:54.975]  And the, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the press went, urgh!
[01:38:56.696 --> 01:38:59.717]  They knew they were going to lie!
[01:38:59.757 --> 01:39:01.437]  They're still saying today, I'm suing them!
[01:39:01.477 --> 01:39:04.918]  There was a collective groan in the courtroom that I was really surprised at.
[01:39:04.978 --> 01:39:13.881]  I wish there had been TV cameras there, because yes, as soon as Mr. Enoch acknowledged that and said, Mr. Jones is waiving anything over and above a dollar, there was a...
[01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:18.484]  A tone over the courtroom among the people who were there to hate you.
[01:39:18.564 --> 01:39:20.485]  And by the way, their side doesn't want cameras.
[01:39:20.625 --> 01:39:28.231]  I'm demanding gavel-to-gavel coverage because how many videos did Enoch show of me apologizing to the families and saying I believe it happened years ago?
[01:39:28.351 --> 01:39:35.917]  Look, what I found in yesterday's presentation there as a spectator, what I found to be very interesting is this was probably the first time
[01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:40.361]  That anybody in that courtroom had actually watched InfoWars.
[01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:41.982]  Had actually seen what you said.
[01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:50.129]  And if you watch what you said, and you compare that to what the press has reported that you said, it's as if those two things are happening on two different planets.
[01:39:50.830 --> 01:40:00.779]  Because I watched that video sitting there in that courtroom, end to end, and at no point did you in that video say anything like what they've said you said.
[01:40:00.799 --> 01:40:03.041]  These are the videos they're suing me for!
[01:40:03.601 --> 01:40:03.903]  That's true.
[01:40:03.923 --> 01:40:05.570]  I'm sorry for your kids, I believe they died.
[01:40:05.771 --> 01:40:07.920]  That turns into I'm sending troops to their houses!
[01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:12.073]  Yeah, you know, that was an accusation that was made by the plaintiff yesterday.
[01:40:12.113 --> 01:40:15.016]  There was an accusation that you had sent people to somebody's house.
[01:40:15.977 --> 01:40:20.460]  And then when we looked into the facts of that, that doesn't seem to be exactly what happened either.
[01:40:20.661 --> 01:40:29.128]  But, you know, that's... Well, was Rob Dew going, look, we're not saying it didn't happen, but why are they delivering food to another school and no food delivered for years?
[01:40:29.208 --> 01:40:31.870]  Or why do they say their house is a parking lot in Florida?
[01:40:32.071 --> 01:40:33.212]  We weren't saying where their house was.
[01:40:34.144 --> 01:40:37.505]  Look, that's, yeah, when you look at the actual video, you look at the primary source.
[01:40:37.525 --> 01:40:46.947]  I mean, when somebody has something to say to me about a broadcast or a publication, I don't want to look at a news article that tells me what that says.
[01:40:47.047 --> 01:40:48.447]  Why don't you provide me a link?
[01:40:48.467 --> 01:40:56.809]  I mean, a third-rate blogger would do that, would provide a link to the actual primary source and say, this is what the guy said, click here to see for yourself.
[01:40:56.849 --> 01:40:58.169]  It'd be like saying, I said,
[01:40:59.409 --> 01:41:01.070]  I hypothetically covered my mouth because I'll edit this out.
[01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:05.671]  You know, murder all the Jews, or murder all the white people, or murder all, or inward, inward.
[01:41:06.151 --> 01:41:08.692]  You would show me saying it.
[01:41:08.712 --> 01:41:09.713]  I'm not saying that.
[01:41:09.733 --> 01:41:10.333]  They'll do it, yeah, but.
[01:41:10.753 --> 01:41:11.373]  I'm saying you would.
[01:41:11.913 --> 01:41:13.434]  Brandon Tatum, we got your Skype back.
[01:41:13.474 --> 01:41:13.894]  God bless you.
[01:41:13.914 --> 01:41:14.514]  With us the next segment.
[01:41:14.534 --> 01:41:15.054]  We'll get into this.
[01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:16.155]  But you're hearing all this.
[01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:19.316]  I see you nodding your head on Skype because you said that's what you've experienced with InfoWars.
[01:41:19.576 --> 01:41:20.436]  They say one thing.
[01:41:20.696 --> 01:41:21.717]  You go actually see what I said.
[01:41:21.757 --> 01:41:22.297]  It's the opposite.
[01:41:23.581 --> 01:41:23.982]  Yeah, man.
[01:41:24.042 --> 01:41:29.851]  You know, the funny thing is I have people who were conservatives and people who agree with me on many things.
[01:41:29.991 --> 01:41:32.034]  And they say, well, no, Alex Jones says all this.
[01:41:32.054 --> 01:41:33.637]  And I say, well, show me the video.
[01:41:34.423 --> 01:41:36.845]  You can prove to me that he's wrong about something.
[01:41:37.086 --> 01:41:48.817]  You can say whatever you want, but I remember watching way before the president was elected, and you were talking about how they were rigging the polls and stuff like that, and people were like, oh, he's just being so dramatic and all this other stuff.
[01:41:49.237 --> 01:41:57.485]  And then you see them showing polls of Hillary Clinton up at 90%, and then the president won the presidency by a landslide.
[01:41:58.105 --> 01:42:05.609]  Somebody's lying, and they want to paint it on you, but in fact, these other people are the ones telling lies, and you are articulating truths.
[01:42:05.809 --> 01:42:14.033]  And if anybody watch any of the stuff that you say, and this is what I tell everybody that watch it, I say, go and you find a clip, you find a point, and you prove him wrong.
[01:42:14.453 --> 01:42:16.174]  If you can do that, I'll believe you.
[01:42:16.474 --> 01:42:18.915]  Other than that, you need to listen and pay attention.
[01:42:19.838 --> 01:42:22.601]  Well, God bless you, and I don't want to make it all up myself, but they're coming for me.
[01:42:23.061 --> 01:42:25.264]  I mean, this is like they're invading a country.
[01:42:25.344 --> 01:42:27.866]  It's like every show, every channel, even Fox.
[01:42:28.447 --> 01:42:29.648]  Look, they're not just coming for you.
[01:42:29.668 --> 01:42:32.151]  I mean, you're a very good target.
[01:42:32.191 --> 01:42:33.132]  Once they get me, it's everybody.
[01:42:33.392 --> 01:42:38.957]  You're a very good target, because, you know, this is a propaganda war.
[01:42:39.318 --> 01:42:42.821]  And they did not take a lot of conservative voices seriously.
[01:42:43.502 --> 01:42:47.643]  You know, and once this election happened, I think that the left freaked out.
[01:42:47.743 --> 01:42:53.605]  I mean, I see a lot of people who agree with me politically, who say, I can't believe that this happened.
[01:42:54.145 --> 01:42:54.926]  How did this happen?
[01:42:55.066 --> 01:42:59.147]  And they didn't realize, you know, they might be polling people about... So now they are taking it serious.
[01:42:59.167 --> 01:43:00.728]  Let's talk about that, where we think it's going.
[01:43:00.748 --> 01:43:01.548]  Brandon Tatum is our guest.
[01:43:01.568 --> 01:43:01.888]  Stay with us.
[01:43:02.719 --> 01:43:07.082]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[01:43:17.029 --> 01:43:21.593]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:43:21.833 --> 01:43:30.099]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects

[01:44:02.387 --> 01:44:05.570]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:44:06.051 --> 01:44:07.352]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:44:07.853 --> 01:44:19.285]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:44:20.066 --> 01:44:28.969]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:44:29.389 --> 01:44:35.211]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:44:35.451 --> 01:44:40.093]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:44:40.613 --> 01:44:42.894]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:44:43.254 --> 01:44:44.615]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:44:44.995 --> 01:44:54.622]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:44:54.722 --> 01:44:56.884]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:44:57.384 --> 01:45:02.268]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:45:02.668 --> 01:45:07.692]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[01:45:07.832 --> 01:45:12.736]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver.
[01:45:12.776 --> 01:45:16.118]  That is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[01:45:16.178 --> 01:45:24.925]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first-aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and secondary burns, skin irritations.
[01:45:25.145 --> 01:45:27.386]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[01:45:27.506 --> 01:45:29.448]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[01:45:29.988 --> 01:45:31.249]  It's just incredible.
[01:45:31.349 --> 01:45:32.429]  It's $29.95 out of the gate.
[01:45:32.509 --> 01:45:33.690]  This is next level.
[01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:35.290]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[01:45:35.831 --> 01:45:39.972]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[01:45:40.313 --> 01:45:44.734]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[01:45:44.855 --> 01:45:48.296]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[01:45:48.456 --> 01:45:49.737]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[01:45:49.877 --> 01:45:52.718]  I can tell you right now, my dad is a moral surgeon and dentist.
[01:45:53.078 --> 01:46:01.740]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals, and he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[01:46:02.001 --> 01:46:06.282]  Inforestore.com, Inforestlife.com, or 888-533-139.
[01:46:06.342 --> 01:46:13.944]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FBA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[01:46:14.484 --> 01:46:16.967]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using.
[01:46:17.208 --> 01:46:18.729]  The military, hospitals, you name it.
[01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:19.610]  This is it.
[01:46:19.891 --> 01:46:22.314]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[01:46:22.414 --> 01:46:24.076]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[01:46:24.276 --> 01:46:24.837]  Nanotech.
[01:46:25.037 --> 01:46:28.861]  Super small particles which go in electromagnetically, just goes right to the heart of something.
[01:46:31.018 --> 01:46:32.519]  Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel
[01:47:06.791 --> 01:47:09.397]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.828 --> 01:47:23.949]  I've got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:47:24.469 --> 01:47:27.090]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:47:27.230 --> 01:47:30.531]  I'm a guy who's a boss on this highway.
[01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:33.712]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[01:47:33.852 --> 01:47:35.992]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[01:47:36.193 --> 01:47:39.734]  I know I'm working for the state on my highway patrol.
[01:47:39.754 --> 01:47:44.435]  Well, the president is wanting to get the public's intake.
[01:47:45.632 --> 01:47:50.755]  The public's view on China's got a 900 billion dollar trade deficit with us, it's estimated.
[01:47:51.535 --> 01:47:53.696]  And all Trump wanted was 100 billion.
[01:47:54.536 --> 01:47:56.277]  He said, give me something, God.
[01:47:56.457 --> 01:47:57.118]  And they said, no.
[01:47:57.818 --> 01:47:59.879]  So he said, listen, we're going to have a trade war.
[01:47:59.919 --> 01:48:02.040]  So he wants the public's feedback next hour.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:02.781]  I'm going to get into that.
[01:48:02.821 --> 01:48:06.963]  Trump's free trade plan could be his Reagan moment.
[01:48:07.563 --> 01:48:09.304]  Mr. Gorbachev, how about China?
[01:48:09.344 --> 01:48:11.125]  You actually reciprocate a little bit here.
[01:48:11.745 --> 01:48:12.966]  I mean, Trump's not asking for that much.
[01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:13.266]  He's like,
[01:48:14.144 --> 01:48:14.925]  Give me something!
[01:48:14.945 --> 01:48:19.588]  You know, it's like, you go out to dinner with somebody and you go, I'll pay for 90% of the bill, but why don't you get the dessert?
[01:48:19.608 --> 01:48:20.129]  And they're like, no!
[01:48:20.829 --> 01:48:21.770]  It's totally unreasonable.
[01:48:22.251 --> 01:48:27.255]  New York Times admits it hired editors despite knowing about her horrifying racist tweets.
[01:48:27.295 --> 01:48:35.721]  So, new article, they're not denying that she said white people are evil goblins and need to be exterminated and all this other craziness.
[01:48:36.821 --> 01:48:45.344]  Now the New York Times is defending, and Brandon Tatum, great patriot, former police officer, SWAT team guy, now works with Turning Point USA and the great work they're doing.
[01:48:45.364 --> 01:48:47.785]  I've got Mark Rondazza riding a shotgun with me.
[01:48:48.205 --> 01:48:51.226]  Let me ask you this, Brandon, where do you at a gut level think this is ending?
[01:48:51.246 --> 01:48:58.208]  Because the economy's turning around, numbers show that black Americans, Hispanic Americans are double digit from what they were supporting Trump.
[01:48:58.608 --> 01:49:00.649]  That's really scaring the left, even skewed polls.
[01:49:01.698 --> 01:49:03.140]  Where do you think we're at, Brandon Tatum?
[01:49:17.122 --> 01:49:18.743]  Well, I think we're headed in the right direction.
[01:49:18.803 --> 01:49:22.784]  I think that this is, you know, this comparison came from the next to Susan's new movie.
[01:49:23.124 --> 01:49:25.005]  It's going to come out and everybody can see for themselves.
[01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:25.805]  I don't want to spoil it.
[01:49:26.225 --> 01:49:35.148]  But a component of it is that, you know, Abraham Lincoln had a very similar situation where it was up to him at a pivotal moment to change the country forever.
[01:49:35.469 --> 01:49:36.389]  Now, it took a while.
[01:49:36.689 --> 01:49:41.851]  You know, there was things that were subsequently put into place once African Americans were freed and things like that.
[01:49:42.171 --> 01:49:42.311]  But
[01:49:42.911 --> 01:49:44.593]  I think that Trump is doing the same thing.
[01:49:44.653 --> 01:49:45.935]  We're watching growth happen.
[01:49:46.035 --> 01:49:51.480]  We're watching our, I guess, image on a worldwide scale increase.
[01:49:51.701 --> 01:49:53.503]  Unemployment is down for African Americans.
[01:49:53.643 --> 01:49:56.646]  There's so many jobs out there, we don't have enough qualified people to take those jobs.
[01:49:57.046 --> 01:50:04.174]  And I think over time, we're going to see things heading in the right direction, and I think that our decision in 2016 actually saved America.
[01:50:04.675 --> 01:50:10.471]  And people may disagree with that, but we are watching things unfold in a historical manner.
[01:50:10.772 --> 01:50:12.797]  I mean, especially with the GDP being where it said.
[01:50:13.604 --> 01:50:24.592]  You know, the confidence in this country, America First mentality, all of those things are invaluable to sending people in the right direction or giving America the proper trajectory.
[01:50:24.852 --> 01:50:27.213]  And I think that the American people can see what's going on.
[01:50:27.514 --> 01:50:30.776]  And in 2020, we want the same results and even better.
[01:50:31.216 --> 01:50:32.697]  So I think we're winning this battle.
[01:50:32.757 --> 01:50:34.979]  They're just going down, kicking and screaming.
[01:50:35.632 --> 01:50:36.012]  I agree.
[01:50:36.132 --> 01:50:37.233]  Everybody likes a winner.
[01:50:37.713 --> 01:50:39.694]  And that's why the Hispanic numbers are exploding.
[01:50:40.094 --> 01:50:41.235]  Everybody gets it now.
[01:50:41.715 --> 01:50:42.776]  I think the facade's imploding.
[01:50:42.796 --> 01:50:51.600]  And I agree, the ghost of the Democratic Party, the KKK, all their manipulations, all their evil, they're putting out their full attack right now because it's death throes.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:53.441]  But I don't want to be too confident.
[01:50:53.961 --> 01:50:54.862]  Mark Randazzo, what do you think?
[01:50:55.503 --> 01:51:02.412]  Look, I don't think the Democratic Party, I mean, I know it's not going to be a popular view on the show, but I don't think the Democratic Party is evil, they just have a different philosophy.
[01:51:02.752 --> 01:51:12.645]  Their philosophy is to bind people through identity politics and run as a coalition of identity politics coalitions.
[01:51:12.665 --> 01:51:13.727]  That's the opposite of Martin Luther King.
[01:51:14.478 --> 01:51:14.839]  I agree.
[01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:17.201]  But it has worked for them.
[01:51:17.461 --> 01:51:18.903]  It's worked for them in certain areas.
[01:51:18.983 --> 01:51:20.564]  It definitely works for them in the cities.
[01:51:20.584 --> 01:51:22.486]  Yeah, it'll definitely work to destroy the country too.
[01:51:23.227 --> 01:51:24.168]  I don't agree with it.
[01:51:24.548 --> 01:51:26.190]  And I don't agree with it and I don't like it.
[01:51:28.871 --> 01:51:32.995]  I don't think it works for them, because when I went to California, this was depressing.
[01:51:33.315 --> 01:51:36.618]  I saw nothing but homeless people scattered in the streets.
[01:51:36.698 --> 01:51:39.982]  It smelled like pee and urine, you know, all in the streets.
[01:51:40.322 --> 01:51:47.188]  And the funny thing is that downtown LA is not majority African-American, yet the majority of the homeless were African-Americans.
[01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:49.851]  You know, the crime capital of America.
[01:51:49.891 --> 01:51:52.734]  Why do African-Americans statistically do worse in Democrat areas?
[01:51:53.899 --> 01:51:54.920]  Well, look at Chicago.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:55.981]  Look at Baltimore.
[01:51:56.741 --> 01:52:00.144]  The murder capital of the United States of America is run by Democrats.
[01:52:00.464 --> 01:52:08.131]  I mean, so if anybody's struggling or if it's detrimental to anybody, and this is historically, the people on the left, their philosophies don't work.
[01:52:08.451 --> 01:52:10.673]  The welfare state didn't work for African-Americans.
[01:52:10.913 --> 01:52:13.435]  What they're doing in these Democratic-run cities are causing more
[01:52:13.575 --> 01:52:14.857]  I mean, it makes everybody dependent.
[01:52:14.877 --> 01:52:19.322]  We know dependency, whether you spoil your kids or whatever, it destroys people and it's pure evil.
[01:52:19.342 --> 01:52:23.467]  So let me ask you this, Brandon Tatum, and we're going to have our nons continue in the next hour with other guests joining us.
[01:52:23.487 --> 01:52:24.328]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:52:28.373 --> 01:52:30.556]  As we see the trance starting to break,
[01:52:32.048 --> 01:52:37.054]  At a gut level, how do you think they could grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[01:52:37.214 --> 01:52:43.100]  I'm worried with them saying Trump calling CNN fake news, blood's going to be on your hands, you're going to cause violence.
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:47.325]  These are the... David Gergen, blood on Trump's hands if there's violence.
[01:52:47.505 --> 01:52:50.749]  Evil, blue blood Republican, David Gergen, really a creepy weirdo.
[01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:53.070]  Acosta's saying the same thing.
[01:52:53.410 --> 01:52:55.671]  Trump's leading a hate movement against media.
[01:52:55.691 --> 01:52:58.151]  No, they're the ones calling for killing him and saying he's a liar.
[01:52:58.191 --> 01:52:59.192]  All he does is expose him.
[01:52:59.452 --> 01:53:06.514]  So I'm really worried about them staging something or getting some crazy to do something to attack their own people so they can play victim.
[01:53:06.594 --> 01:53:12.256]  I mean, at a gut level, as a former police officer SWAT team guy, what are you and your smart friends that look into these things?
[01:53:12.276 --> 01:53:15.017]  I mean, how do... what type of tricks are they going to play?
[01:53:15.037 --> 01:53:17.598]  Because we know the left's always staging attacks on themselves.
[01:53:19.099 --> 01:53:25.644]  I think they're definitely setting themselves up to have an excuse in case something like this happens to then further push propaganda.
[01:53:25.884 --> 01:53:28.686]  But I think that the American people, we aren't that stupid.
[01:53:29.507 --> 01:53:30.728]  We listen to what they're saying.
[01:53:30.988 --> 01:53:39.034]  Even people that disagree with you and I, Alex, or disagree with what's going on in the show, they can see people holding bloody heads of President Donald Trump.
[01:53:39.374 --> 01:53:41.415]  They can see the lies and manipulation.
[01:53:41.676 --> 01:53:43.517]  They can see money in their bank accounts.
[01:53:43.797 --> 01:53:53.903]  They can see that since he's become president, homosexuals haven't lost rights, women aren't doing poorly, African-American people aren't going back to Africa and returning to slavery.
[01:53:54.243 --> 01:53:56.324]  I mean, we are not stupid.
[01:53:56.584 --> 01:53:57.365]  That's why he won.
[01:53:57.385 --> 01:53:58.646]  Oh, I forgot they said that about Trump.
[01:53:58.786 --> 01:54:00.707]  They said he was going to bring slavery back.
[01:54:03.214 --> 01:54:04.155]  That's going to be quite a challenge.
[01:54:04.235 --> 01:54:11.057]  I can't believe that 40 years ago, when he got control of golf courses, there were still golf courses that blacks and Jews couldn't go to.
[01:54:11.337 --> 01:54:12.657]  Trump's the one that did all that!
[01:54:12.838 --> 01:54:14.098]  That's why the rappers all loved him!
[01:54:14.278 --> 01:54:17.219]  Then they turn it around that he's going to send black people to Africa!
[01:54:17.339 --> 01:54:25.622]  Look, before he got elected, the predictions of what was going to happen when he got elected, this Fourth Reich that was going to happen.
[01:54:25.642 --> 01:54:30.504]  I mean, I remember a lot of Jewish friends were saying, oh, we're very scared about how anti-Semitic he is.
[01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:35.189]  This guy is probably the most pro-Israel president we've ever had.
[01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.770]  That's what I mean.
[01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:36.611]  It's like Brandon said.
[01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:37.552]  It's all upside down.
[01:54:37.592 --> 01:54:39.756]  Brandon, in closing, where do you think this is going then?
[01:54:39.776 --> 01:54:41.879]  I keep asking that because it's just crazy.
[01:54:43.516 --> 01:54:46.297]  Well, you know, I really believe that God is in control of this.
[01:54:46.357 --> 01:54:49.018]  I don't think President Trump is the president by happenstance.
[01:54:49.038 --> 01:54:53.360]  You know, he shouldn't have been the president given all the attacks and the government against him, the FBI.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:55:03.925]  I mean, he shouldn't be the president, but I think God intervened because God wanted us to have a country that is prosperous, that he wants to have a country that understands him and believes in who he is.
[01:55:04.265 --> 01:55:08.387]  And I think that he's going to control some of these things and God is going to make it better for us.
[01:55:08.627 --> 01:55:09.927]  But we got to go through the war.
[01:55:10.067 --> 01:55:11.088]  It's going to be a fight.
[01:55:11.528 --> 01:55:15.453]  You know, just like Jesus got killed, they believe they killed him, but he rose on the third day.
[01:55:15.834 --> 01:55:20.279]  So, I think that there's light at the end of the tunnel, and that God is in control, and he's gonna make everything better.
[01:55:20.439 --> 01:55:22.142]  But we're gonna have to go through a fight first.
[01:55:22.502 --> 01:55:26.847]  Brandon, I totally agree with you, and just like Nineveh, they took the reprieve for a hundred years and got it.
[01:55:27.228 --> 01:55:28.229]  Some people didn't.
[01:55:28.489 --> 01:55:30.492]  The prophet came, and I'm not saying he's a prophet, you know what I mean.
[01:55:30.932 --> 01:55:31.833]  God's given us a chance.
[01:55:32.033 --> 01:55:34.314]  Here's prosperity, can make it better, come together.
[01:55:34.715 --> 01:55:37.656]  You know, Martin Luther King type ideas, really classical liberal ideas.
[01:55:38.237 --> 01:55:41.238]  Or, if we reject Trump, I think that's when the judgment happens.
[01:55:41.319 --> 01:55:42.259]  I don't think we're out of the woods.
[01:55:42.579 --> 01:55:48.043]  I think we're being given the chance, being shown things could be better, and I think if we don't take this, we're gonna lose everything.
[01:55:49.724 --> 01:55:51.064]  I agree 100%.
[01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:51.765]  I agree 100%.
[01:55:53.606 --> 01:55:54.667]  Can't you feel it, too?
[01:55:54.727 --> 01:55:55.827]  Like, the energy in the country?
[01:55:56.148 --> 01:55:57.508]  It's so, like, it's good and bad.
[01:55:57.548 --> 01:55:58.349]  It's, like, really strong.
[01:55:59.639 --> 01:56:00.579]  Well, I'll tell you this, man.
[01:56:00.759 --> 01:56:02.520]  I was walking around LAX.
[01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:06.822]  I just came from LA, and I had my Make America Great Again hat on.
[01:56:07.322 --> 01:56:12.924]  And the funny thing is, and you know, you hear, I don't know if it's because of my black privilege or not, but nobody attacked me.
[01:56:13.525 --> 01:56:18.847]  Nobody said anything to me except one lady, and she told me she loved my hat and is very brave for me to do what I did.
[01:56:19.307 --> 01:56:29.191]  So I don't know what mythical scariness that they're trying to portray, but by and large, if you are on boots on the ground type mentality,
[01:56:29.691 --> 01:56:33.352]  People aren't as stupid as they're trying to make us think.
[01:56:33.572 --> 01:56:39.134]  People aren't as openly hateful as they try to put together in clips and videos.
[01:56:39.634 --> 01:56:52.198]  So, I honestly believe that most people, and you know, half of America didn't even vote this time around, but I think most people are either in the middle or they're starting to wake up to realizing that this is just absolutely ridiculous.
[01:56:52.218 --> 01:56:53.819]  And that's why the Democrats are panicking.
[01:56:54.656 --> 01:56:57.378]  That's why they have to use somebody like LeBron James.
[01:56:57.438 --> 01:56:58.299]  This is what they want to do.
[01:56:58.559 --> 01:57:02.562]  See, back in the day during slavery, they would hold the biggest, strongest slave.
[01:57:02.702 --> 01:57:07.665]  They will beat him and they'll push him in front of the crowd and say, if you disagree, this is what's going to happen to you.
[01:57:07.705 --> 01:57:08.806]  We will break your will.
[01:57:09.227 --> 01:57:13.790]  So what they do now psychologically is they put one of the most powerful influencers
[01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:22.035]  In the entire country, they put him on and they say, no matter, because this is what he said, no matter how big you get, you still are the N-word.
[01:57:22.356 --> 01:57:23.156]  You still black.
[01:57:23.436 --> 01:57:24.637]  They will still hold you down.
[01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:34.744]  They just put that man in front of everybody in America and threatened them and showed them that you, no matter how big you get in this country, no matter how free you are, we still control you.
[01:57:35.024 --> 01:57:39.467]  This is what they're doing to our brains and we're not having it and people like me are going to stand up against it.
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:42.483]  Well, Mr. Tatum, you are on fire.
[01:57:42.523 --> 01:57:45.927]  We look forward to having you back on very, very, very soon.
[01:57:45.967 --> 01:57:48.971]  Everybody should follow what you're doing right now at BrandonTatum.com.
[01:57:49.331 --> 01:57:50.253]  God bless you so much.
[01:57:50.273 --> 01:57:50.954]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:57:52.944 --> 01:57:58.006]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[01:57:58.126 --> 01:58:02.868]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver.
[01:58:03.068 --> 01:58:06.329]  That is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:15.233]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and second degree burns, skin irritations.
[01:58:15.453 --> 01:58:17.674]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[01:58:17.794 --> 01:58:19.735]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[01:58:19.955 --> 01:58:21.736]  It's just incredible.
[01:58:21.836 --> 01:58:22.736]  It's $29.95 out of the gates.
[01:58:22.816 --> 01:58:23.997]  This is next level.
[01:58:24.057 --> 01:58:25.598]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[01:58:26.138 --> 01:58:30.280]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:35.042]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[01:58:35.162 --> 01:58:38.604]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[01:58:38.784 --> 01:58:40.045]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[01:58:40.185 --> 01:58:43.026]  I can tell you right now, my dad is a moral surgeon and dentist.
[01:58:43.366 --> 01:58:52.050]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals, and he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:56.912]  Inforestore.com, Inforestlife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:56.992 --> 01:59:04.236]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[01:59:04.796 --> 01:59:09.118]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[01:59:09.439 --> 01:59:09.919]  This is it.
[01:59:10.199 --> 01:59:12.600]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:14.381]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[01:59:14.581 --> 01:59:15.162]  Nanotech.
[01:59:15.322 --> 01:59:17.823]  Super small particles which go in electromagnetically.
[01:59:17.903 --> 01:59:19.164]  It goes right in the heart of something.
[01:59:22.176 --> 01:59:30.802]  Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel contains the powerful Silver Sol technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano silver market.
[01:59:31.002 --> 01:59:43.770]  As the only FDA certified wound treatment product of its kind, this gel has been shown to fight infection and irritation while also helping speed up the healing process.
[01:59:43.971 --> 01:59:46.132]  And that's the way I like it.
[01:59:46.232 --> 01:59:51.415]  Grab a bottle of Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel right now at infowarslife.com
[01:59:56.837 --> 02:00:02.859]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:17.284]  You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[02:00:19.099 --> 02:00:24.263]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.105 --> 02:00:28.326]  Mark Rondaz is riding a shotgun with us.
[02:00:28.346 --> 02:00:30.828]  Coming up, we've got one of the gentlemen that's going to be leading the prayer vigil.
[02:00:31.309 --> 02:00:33.230]  He's an African-American, but he's just going to be called American.
[02:00:33.250 --> 02:00:34.952]  He's like, I don't want to be called just a human being.
[02:00:35.472 --> 02:00:37.273]  Will Johnson, UnitedAmericaFirst.com.
[02:00:37.814 --> 02:00:42.938]  The left says they're coming out there with guns to, quote, eliminate the evil Nazis that, quote, beat them up.
[02:00:43.458 --> 02:00:45.220]  But the last two events, they show up.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.742]  Antifa attacks people, gets their butt kicked.
[02:00:48.362 --> 02:00:50.545]  But then Antifa says we're going to shoot the Nazis.
[02:00:50.725 --> 02:00:50.926]  Yeah.
[02:00:51.566 --> 02:00:52.928]  And the black Nazis.
[02:00:53.389 --> 02:00:54.671]  This is the cuckoo level.
[02:00:54.851 --> 02:00:59.437]  Yeah, the violence that is both engaged in and condoned.
[02:00:59.457 --> 02:01:04.163]  I mean, in San Jose, the police funneled Trump supporters.
[02:01:04.744 --> 02:01:04.844]  Yeah.
[02:01:24.079 --> 02:01:30.241]  You know, it was just, it's horrifying when you think of the fact that somebody in a liberal municipality would do that.
[02:01:30.261 --> 02:01:35.502]  I mean, if I were in charge of the police force, I don't care how awful the people are who are protesting.
[02:01:35.682 --> 02:01:41.544]  You know, if it was the KKK marching, I would instruct my police, there better not be a hostile handling on their head.
[02:01:41.564 --> 02:01:48.866]  But the thing is, the police come out and protect them, but when it's actual prayer vigils with a multiracial group, they allow them to be beat up.
[02:01:48.886 --> 02:01:49.287]  Whoever it is.
[02:01:49.327 --> 02:01:50.767]  Because they don't want people coming together.
[02:01:50.987 --> 02:01:55.811]  Whoever it is, the government's job in a situation like that is to stop the violence.
[02:01:55.891 --> 02:02:00.514]  So no matter what point of view it is... No, I know, I agree, but I'm saying they protect the KKK on purpose because that creates division.
[02:02:00.594 --> 02:02:02.076]  Well, they should protect them on purpose.
[02:02:02.456 --> 02:02:07.900]  Yeah, but I'm saying that they don't protect real patriot Americans that are coming out.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.422]  Look, yeah, this video here, this was... San Francisco.
[02:02:10.442 --> 02:02:11.543]  Yeah, a prayer vigil, right?
[02:02:12.724 --> 02:02:14.765]  I mean, this is permissible.
[02:02:15.766 --> 02:02:18.088]  This is something that the authorities won't do anything about.
[02:02:20.745 --> 02:02:22.285]  You know, it's just, it's horrifying.
[02:02:22.486 --> 02:02:29.528]  I mean, I don't know why, you know, why we cannot band together and say that once you cross the violence-words-divide, you're the one who's wrong.
[02:02:29.848 --> 02:02:43.412]  All I know is... I don't care what ideas you're espousing, you know, I don't care how righteous you think you are, when you think that you can cross over that line and attack somebody because you don't like their speech, you're my enemy and I don't care if I absolutely agree with your politics 100%.
[02:02:43.452 --> 02:02:48.693]  And that is, that's just a credo that I don't see too many people observing.
[02:02:48.753 --> 02:02:50.494]  What is wrong with these Antifa people?
[02:02:51.877 --> 02:03:00.800]  I mean, you know, there's any number of theories that you have, but most of them are bored, rich, white kids that decided they want to play dress-up revolutionary.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:01.420]  I agree.
[02:03:01.721 --> 02:03:02.721]  It's a form of LARPing.
[02:03:04.181 --> 02:03:06.182]  And I don't think they realize how much danger they're in.
[02:03:06.202 --> 02:03:06.882]  People are getting around.
[02:03:06.902 --> 02:03:08.103]  I mean, I know for a fact.
[02:03:09.266 --> 02:03:19.849]  I know for a fact a lot of really serious retired veterans that have run most elite CIA teams are really, like, they're getting really tired of this.
[02:03:19.869 --> 02:03:24.290]  What I don't want to see is, you know, I don't want to see them get their own beat down.
[02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:25.590]  I would rather see the cops do their job.
[02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:27.931]  Well don't worry, it's not going to happen while they're out there in the little mask.
[02:03:28.351 --> 02:03:30.232]  They're going to get snatched up and put in a van.
[02:03:30.532 --> 02:03:31.693]  Well, I don't want to see that either.
[02:03:31.713 --> 02:03:36.636]  I want to see the cops do their job and stand there and say, we're not going to allow violence.
[02:03:36.876 --> 02:03:37.877]  No, no, I agree.
[02:03:38.257 --> 02:03:44.481]  I'm just saying, these guys can't go beat up women and children on video and not have real warriors start coming after them.
[02:03:44.661 --> 02:03:46.022]  I really hope that isn't what happens.
[02:03:46.362 --> 02:03:47.663]  Because, you know, that's the beginning.
[02:03:47.703 --> 02:03:49.384]  I can tell you right now, they are being watched.
[02:03:51.072 --> 02:03:58.881]  Yeah, I see it too, you know, and it's scary to me because I don't want to see this expand because it seems like, you know, it's an arms race.
[02:03:58.921 --> 02:04:07.670]  Look, first it began where it was okay to punch each other and then you got people showing up with shields and bats and now you have armed groups on both sides.
[02:04:08.311 --> 02:04:10.192]  I mean, that's not good for anybody.
[02:04:10.232 --> 02:04:11.413]  How is that good for debate?
[02:04:11.473 --> 02:04:13.014]  How is that good for democracy?
[02:04:13.074 --> 02:04:13.634]  It's terrible.
[02:04:13.654 --> 02:04:18.978]  We're going to wind up descending into armed gangs and, you know, whoever has the greatest amount of force wins.
[02:04:19.438 --> 02:04:20.659]  I got two problems with that.
[02:04:21.119 --> 02:04:22.960]  One problem is it's just evil in itself.
[02:04:23.341 --> 02:04:33.067]  And the second problem is, I got to tell my liberal friends out there, there is no way you're going to beat the right wing when it comes to violence because, you know, a bunch of like
[02:04:33.487 --> 02:04:42.794]  You know, effeminate guys eating tofu who are out there crying about gluten in their coffee are not going to be able to win against people who go to the gym and shoot guns every day at the range.
[02:04:43.294 --> 02:04:48.818]  I mean, I would rather pick any two random right-wing guys than six best-trained liberals anywhere if I'm in a street fight.
[02:04:49.298 --> 02:04:53.721]  So, you know, guys on the left, you don't have anything to gain from this.
[02:04:53.901 --> 02:04:54.802]  It's not going to work.
[02:04:56.323 --> 02:04:57.144]  He'll be right back.
[02:04:57.624 --> 02:04:58.164]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.324 --> 02:04:59.345]  Mark Randazzo is our guest.
[02:04:59.385 --> 02:05:00.146]  Big news straight ahead.
[02:05:03.553 --> 02:05:09.957]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:05:10.037 --> 02:05:16.841]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:05:16.861 --> 02:05:32.391]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:05:33.487 --> 02:05:37.188]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:05:37.328 --> 02:05:42.409]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:05:42.549 --> 02:05:43.729]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:43.869 --> 02:05:45.489]  It is absolutely free.
[02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:50.670]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:05:50.911 --> 02:05:54.771]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:05:54.871 --> 02:05:58.772]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[02:05:58.992 --> 02:06:03.093]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:06:06.073 --> 02:06:08.215]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:08.736 --> 02:06:13.861]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:37.347 --> 02:06:46.074]  Mark Rondaz has been making a lot of amazing points during the race, one of the top first employers out there, and I don't want to just harp all day with all this news about us and how they're trying to censor us, how they're lying about us, but...
[02:06:46.946 --> 02:06:47.386]  They're doing it.
[02:06:48.127 --> 02:06:56.630]  And he was making the point earlier in the break, the tell-tale sign when you get the calls, and other lawyers get the calls, and Brandon Tatum, people saying, you know, on the fake right wing, hey, don't go on with Alex Jones.
[02:06:56.910 --> 02:06:57.550]  He goes, show me!
[02:06:58.431 --> 02:06:59.791]  Show me where he said something racist.
[02:06:59.831 --> 02:07:02.973]  Show me where he bullied the Sandy Hook people.
[02:07:03.513 --> 02:07:04.593]  They can't do it.
[02:07:05.094 --> 02:07:11.016]  And it's like the New York Times, the way they do backflips to lie, and say that I'm bullying people's kids, or I did this or that.
[02:07:11.476 --> 02:07:12.477]  None of it's true.
[02:07:12.937 --> 02:07:15.518]  Or that even since they saw it in court, where I said, okay,
[02:07:16.098 --> 02:07:24.044]  My lawyer's never seen anybody waive the right, in an anti-slap back, to say we may not seek attorney's fees.
[02:07:25.525 --> 02:07:26.966]  We did that, and what do they say?
[02:07:27.246 --> 02:07:29.208]  Jones sues the families, wants their money.
[02:07:29.548 --> 02:07:32.310]  The opposite, because they're committed to evil.
[02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:35.412]  And because they get away with it, because there's a mob, the media's lying.
[02:07:35.653 --> 02:07:36.293]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:07:37.754 --> 02:07:40.376]  Just like our information's powerful, our products are powerful.
[02:07:41.057 --> 02:07:42.738]  And I need people, I even plugged last hour.
[02:07:44.252 --> 02:07:53.880]  I need folks to commit to financially support InfoWars and get air filtration, get water filtration, get non-GMO heirloom seeds, get supplements, get t-shirts that change the world!
[02:07:54.793 --> 02:07:55.453]  It's very simple.
[02:07:55.753 --> 02:07:56.654]  We will continue on.
[02:07:56.674 --> 02:07:58.074]  We will expand in the face of this.
[02:07:58.374 --> 02:07:59.475]  We will change the world together.
[02:07:59.495 --> 02:08:03.256]  We will give you information that's over the horizon, that proves right over and over again.
[02:08:03.276 --> 02:08:05.677]  That's why they're obsessed with saying we're wrong, because we've been right.
[02:08:05.857 --> 02:08:07.478]  Like Brandon Tatum, that was so powerful last hour.
[02:08:07.498 --> 02:08:08.378]  He kept laying out.
[02:08:08.979 --> 02:08:10.499]  I mean, I helped wake him up.
[02:08:10.779 --> 02:08:11.880]  I helped wake up Candace Owens.
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:17.842]  I helped wake up a lot of folks because of you supporting us, because we're here.
[02:08:17.942 --> 02:08:20.123]  So you see the dividends of InfoWars.
[02:08:20.263 --> 02:08:21.304]  Shop with the good guys.
[02:08:21.424 --> 02:08:22.544]  We have incredible.
[02:08:22.764 --> 02:08:24.265]  It's been rated the highest quality.
[02:08:25.302 --> 02:08:26.443]  Vitamin D3 out there.
[02:08:26.963 --> 02:08:29.484]  The highest quality of vitamin B12 out there.
[02:08:30.044 --> 02:08:34.566]  Even BuzzFeed did a hit piece that it tested by Mark Cuban's group in San Francisco trying to sue us.
[02:08:35.126 --> 02:08:37.608]  And they went, well, Jones is really is good vitamin B12.
[02:08:37.668 --> 02:08:38.108]  It's pure.
[02:08:38.408 --> 02:08:39.368]  But here's the best.
[02:08:39.628 --> 02:08:41.469]  We're private labeling what they were selling.
[02:08:41.849 --> 02:08:43.010]  We're saying was the best.
[02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:44.331]  They were so dumb.
[02:08:44.371 --> 02:08:49.473]  They didn't even know that we were $10 less private labeling than the top rated.
[02:08:49.773 --> 02:08:51.694]  I go out and get the top rated.
[02:08:52.034 --> 02:08:53.775]  Most of our products are private labeled.
[02:08:54.824 --> 02:08:56.304]  We sell DNA Force Plus.
[02:08:56.364 --> 02:08:58.625]  It's $300 at doctor's offices for $75!
[02:08:58.965 --> 02:09:01.766]  You don't know what's in it?
[02:09:01.846 --> 02:09:03.246]  Go read the thousands of reviews.
[02:09:03.566 --> 02:09:04.027]  Find out!
[02:09:04.047 --> 02:09:05.187]  40% off.
[02:09:06.127 --> 02:09:13.469]  We also have the new fish oil, the new krill oil, and Roll Call for your kids, a smaller dose of concentrated fish oils, other oils that are known for the brain.
[02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:19.591]  Very expensive process that it goes through to get all the mercury out, because fish is great, but it's got that byproduct.
[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:25.324]  This is down to non-detectable levels unless they use the highest level spectrometers.
[02:09:26.045 --> 02:09:28.206]  That's California testing levels where they try to stop us.
[02:09:28.246 --> 02:09:30.729]  But this is in the industry as clean as it gets.
[02:09:31.089 --> 02:09:33.491]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:09:33.711 --> 02:09:34.251]  No reviews yet.
[02:09:34.271 --> 02:09:35.092]  This is a brand new product.
[02:09:35.693 --> 02:09:37.234]  Support us financially.
[02:09:37.694 --> 02:09:39.116]  We are in one hell of a fight.
[02:09:39.136 --> 02:09:40.717]  And I don't care about money at the end of the day.
[02:09:40.757 --> 02:09:41.317]  I want to win.
[02:09:41.618 --> 02:09:47.963]  But it takes money, like mid-air refueling of jet aircraft, fighter bombers, to get them to their location, to hit the target.
[02:09:49.364 --> 02:09:51.424]  Sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[02:09:51.544 --> 02:09:52.725]  Makes a lot of things, lost liters.
[02:09:53.105 --> 02:09:54.685]  Free shipping, orders $50 or more.
[02:09:55.365 --> 02:09:57.586]  Every order has 5% Patriot Points.
[02:09:57.626 --> 02:09:58.526]  That builds up rapidly.
[02:10:00.186 --> 02:10:01.187]  That's a rewards program.
[02:10:01.567 --> 02:10:04.627]  InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:10:04.887 --> 02:10:08.808]  We have the new InfoWars hexagon logo t-shirt in army green.
[02:10:09.068 --> 02:10:10.949]  Very, very popular.
[02:10:11.009 --> 02:10:12.449]  That just came out, made in America.
[02:10:13.288 --> 02:10:17.889]  We then also have the mean like a wolverine and reelect 45.
[02:10:18.469 --> 02:10:23.291]  You know, I said, hey Walmart, you shouldn't have taken down the impeach 45 t-shirt.
[02:10:23.331 --> 02:10:25.431]  If that sells for you, leave it up.
[02:10:25.771 --> 02:10:27.932]  But sell, not even mine, somebody else's.
[02:10:28.932 --> 02:10:29.332]  Reelect 45.
[02:10:30.513 --> 02:10:33.073]  We created our own because the marketplace of ideas.
[02:10:33.373 --> 02:10:35.154]  And that's what you were saying during the break about Spotify.
[02:10:36.018 --> 02:10:42.106]  And now they create the thing of, well, we went and saw two of his podcasts that are hate, so we took those down, but we're not taking him down.
[02:10:42.266 --> 02:10:45.650]  They're all copying YouTube to condition people to get ready.
[02:10:45.690 --> 02:10:49.655]  Well, we gave him chances, but he didn't stop, but they never mentioned what I did.
[02:10:49.695 --> 02:10:53.520]  So, segue from Spotify, what you said off air, into the New York Times and the rest of it.
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:56.302]  Well, you know, hate is such a malleable term.
[02:10:56.322 --> 02:11:00.145]  I mean, you know, hate really means something, an opinion I don't agree with.
[02:11:00.345 --> 02:11:08.071]  Because if you want to get rid of hate speech, I mean, I don't see how anything you've said is anywhere close to what that New York Times columnist you showed earlier saying.
[02:11:08.311 --> 02:11:10.092]  Board member saying whites are subhuman.
[02:11:10.212 --> 02:11:13.735]  Yeah, I mean, how is that not hate speech if there is such a thing?
[02:11:13.775 --> 02:11:15.817]  I just hate that term hate speech because it's...
[02:11:16.477 --> 02:11:17.177]  It's not a thing.
[02:11:17.317 --> 02:11:18.558]  It doesn't mean anything.
[02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:23.160]  It means Jones is banned because he beat up a trans child.
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:23.841]  Not even true.
[02:11:24.081 --> 02:11:24.281]  Right.
[02:11:24.521 --> 02:11:33.366]  So, you know, and what really bothers me about your cases, just globally, is that I don't see anybody from the traditional media backing you up.
[02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:37.027]  And I don't understand how they can look at this.
[02:11:38.328 --> 02:11:42.293]  You questioned the official narrative of what happened at Sandy Hook at some point.
[02:11:42.634 --> 02:11:45.377]  At the beginning, you said, you made an investigation.
[02:11:45.798 --> 02:11:54.890]  I don't care what happens, anything that happens, when I get an official story from my government, if I'm not questioning it, I want somebody else to question it to make me question it.
[02:11:55.370 --> 02:12:01.493]  Even if it comes around that, hey, maybe we're going to have a rare circumstance where our government doesn't lie to us one bit.
[02:12:01.513 --> 02:12:03.354]  I mean, it might happen once in a while.
[02:12:03.734 --> 02:12:04.674]  Unicorns may exist.
[02:12:04.714 --> 02:12:07.916]  But the point of the media is to be a watchdog.
[02:12:07.956 --> 02:12:08.856]  You're the fourth estate.
[02:12:08.876 --> 02:12:11.377]  You're supposed to be nipping at their heels constantly.
[02:12:11.417 --> 02:12:12.418]  But instead, they're mercenaries.
[02:12:12.458 --> 02:12:16.940]  But make the point you made about Spotify and then what you made about how people call you, other colleagues.
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:18.761]  You go, show me where, and it's never there.
[02:12:19.457 --> 02:12:22.758]  Right, I mean, look, I take a lot of flack for coming on your show and representing you.
[02:12:23.198 --> 02:12:27.119]  There are a lot of people angry at me, you know, good friends, family.
[02:12:27.139 --> 02:12:29.140]  Like you said, CNN's not calling anymore.
[02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:35.462]  And I say, well, you know, tell me if you're so, you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[02:12:35.522 --> 02:12:41.564]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times or they'll send me a link to some other article saying, you know, paraphrasing what you said.
[02:12:41.644 --> 02:12:44.005]  I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[02:12:44.505 --> 02:12:47.906]  And when I go find it and I said, well, that's not really what was said here.
[02:12:48.686 --> 02:12:50.507]  Well then, you know, then there's like this backpedal.
[02:12:50.527 --> 02:12:53.848]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[02:12:53.868 --> 02:12:54.768]  I say, wait a second.
[02:12:54.948 --> 02:12:59.730]  You know, what I want you to think about is how we need a robust marketplace of ideas.
[02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:03.352]  You know, I don't come on your show because I agree with everything you have to say.
[02:13:03.372 --> 02:13:05.732]  No, I agree, but by the way, talk about targeting our lawyers.
[02:13:06.053 --> 02:13:09.854]  They now have Randy Wilhite that is my family court lawyer.
[02:13:10.274 --> 02:13:11.135]  We're good to go.
[02:13:27.995 --> 02:13:30.458]  Okay, you know, cap of the football team, hole nine yards.
[02:13:30.778 --> 02:13:32.600]  They are literally calling for his head.
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:35.183]  Look, CBS News with Randall Wilhite.
[02:13:35.203 --> 02:13:36.385]  So they're letting lawyers know, too.
[02:13:36.705 --> 02:13:37.546]  You're going to come after him.
[02:13:37.566 --> 02:13:38.087]  You'll ask.
[02:13:38.147 --> 02:13:39.348]  You don't give him representation.
[02:13:39.648 --> 02:13:40.890]  How un-American is that?
[02:13:41.550 --> 02:13:44.213]  Look, the right to counsel is right up there with the right to free speech.
[02:13:44.233 --> 02:13:45.074]  Isn't that like Sixth Amendment?
[02:13:45.715 --> 02:13:45.875]  Yes.
[02:13:46.616 --> 02:13:56.420]  So, you know, but if you just look at this, you know, I remember when, you know, before the election, and I wrote this article here, is the first amendment safe from Donald Trump on CNN.
[02:13:57.161 --> 02:14:03.563]  And I was concerned because when Trump made his speech that said, we're going to open up the libel law.
[02:14:03.603 --> 02:14:04.304]  I was concerned too.
[02:14:04.324 --> 02:14:05.084]  I don't think he got it.
[02:14:05.284 --> 02:14:09.006]  And, you know, and it made me, I mean, I said, wow, that, that got my hackles up.
[02:14:09.166 --> 02:14:10.687]  I mean, I am not, you know.
[02:14:10.707 --> 02:14:13.388]  But now in his own cases, he's, he's using anti-slap.
[02:14:14.176 --> 02:14:15.117]  It's kind of funny, isn't it?
[02:14:15.237 --> 02:14:31.705]  You know, how this is flipped, because now that he got elected, now it is not Donald Trump, but people are anti-Donald Trump, who I should have written this article, I should have written another version of this article saying, is the First Amendment safe from people who have Trump derangement syndrome?
[02:14:32.265 --> 02:14:37.548]  You know, I remember last night we were talking and somebody said, you know, hey, has the right ever really done this?
[02:14:38.553 --> 02:14:43.719]  And I had to correct him, and I said, yes, if you bring the camera down here, heed their rising voices.
[02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:57.496]  New York Times versus Sullivan, the foundational case when it comes to our First Amendment rights, where it was constitutionalized that if you are talking about a public figure, and then expanded to public events,
[02:14:58.357 --> 02:15:01.738]  You must prove defamation over the actual malice.
[02:15:01.758 --> 02:15:04.720]  And this was the South of the KKK suing everybody to shut down speech.
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:05.460]  That's exactly what it was.
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:08.181]  It was exactly what you have going on today.
[02:15:08.361 --> 02:15:20.206]  It was the civil rights movement was invading the South with people who were writing about equality, with people who were trying to make this idea of equality and civil rights infected.
[02:15:20.226 --> 02:15:22.027]  You know, they were trying to spread this idea.
[02:15:22.387 --> 02:15:25.588]  And how did these people who wanted to fight against equality deal with it?
[02:15:25.928 --> 02:15:27.269]  They dealt with it through these kind of
[02:15:27.469 --> 02:15:32.793]  Crazy defamation suits where they were trying to bankrupt anybody who came down there and tried to report.
[02:15:32.933 --> 02:15:36.436]  And now the left is trying to get rid of New York Times vs. Sullivan.
[02:15:36.456 --> 02:15:41.319]  They admit to overturn the First Amendment so they can, but I guess it's the Democrats again.
[02:15:41.479 --> 02:15:44.662]  Look, New York Times vs. Sullivan is sacred as far as I'm concerned.
[02:15:44.722 --> 02:15:48.785]  And you know, so far, I haven't seen Donald Trump actually do anything to go against it.
[02:15:49.165 --> 02:15:51.667]  I think his two Supreme Court nominees would support it.
[02:15:52.087 --> 02:15:55.069]  And I can't say the same for the Supreme Court nominees on the left.
[02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:58.496]  The Democrats are going after New York Times versus Sullivan.
[02:15:59.137 --> 02:16:00.640]  At this point, it looks that way.
[02:16:03.464 --> 02:16:08.007]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:16:08.027 --> 02:16:08.547]  Thanks for holding.
[02:16:08.607 --> 02:16:09.527]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:16:10.028 --> 02:16:13.590]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:26.777]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was pretty cool, and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests.
[02:16:26.937 --> 02:16:30.579]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.

[02:16:37.584 --> 02:16:38.564]  It's all amazing.
[02:16:38.584 --> 02:16:39.125]  Thank you, brother.
[02:16:39.185 --> 02:16:47.710]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:52.553]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:16:52.673 --> 02:16:55.495]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[02:16:55.715 --> 02:16:59.539]  You, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.

[02:20:06.284 --> 02:20:08.903]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:35.848 --> 02:20:38.169]  I get hell-bent and whiskey-bound.
[02:20:56.478 --> 02:20:57.638]  We got some bad news here.
[02:20:57.878 --> 02:21:06.183]  I hate to interrupt Mark Rondazza with something like this especially, but active shooter at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Chicago, CBS is reporting.
[02:21:07.224 --> 02:21:09.665]  They've got a man barricaded in the hospital wing.
[02:21:10.706 --> 02:21:15.628]  Might be mental illness or PTSD, who knows, and we don't really have any more details.
[02:21:15.709 --> 02:21:19.311]  Active shooter at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
[02:21:20.666 --> 02:21:28.068]  The stories are all up on InfoWars.com and InfoWars.com also has links to some live feeds as well.
[02:21:28.828 --> 02:21:30.388]  So we're going to be tracking that.
[02:21:31.188 --> 02:21:35.349]  WDTN reports that a man has barricaded himself on the fourth floor of the base hospital.
[02:21:35.709 --> 02:21:39.250]  The Ohio State Highway Patrol and the local police are sending personnel to the base.
[02:21:39.370 --> 02:21:40.090]  AP reported.
[02:21:40.110 --> 02:21:43.371]  I don't have any other details, but I hope that nobody's been hurt.
[02:21:46.492 --> 02:21:50.396]  Let's get that audio of that loudspeaker if we can.
[02:21:50.917 --> 02:21:53.459]  I do notice that base troops are armed.
[02:21:53.479 --> 02:21:53.880]  That's good.
[02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:56.082]  Trump's been arming the bases more.
[02:21:56.382 --> 02:21:59.425]  Obama had them disarmed so that Major Hassan could do whatever he did.
[02:21:59.925 --> 02:22:00.726]  Obviously they're at Fort Hood.
[02:22:00.746 --> 02:22:02.928]  They said it wasn't terror-related, but obviously it was.
[02:22:03.649 --> 02:22:05.471]  So we're obviously watching that as it unfolds.
[02:22:05.491 --> 02:22:07.233]  Getting back to the point you wanted to make.
[02:22:10.035 --> 02:22:25.663]  On some of the other points about how there's a war on the First Amendment and I don't get how they want to set a precedent and Georgetown, your alma mater, and some of the other universities have signed on saying, you know, we need to shut Alex Jones and the right wing off.
[02:22:26.223 --> 02:22:29.145]  They believe they're going to selectively in court then protect themselves.
[02:22:29.645 --> 02:22:31.666]  This is cutting your nose off despite your face.
[02:22:31.686 --> 02:22:37.329]  So I think you were talking about a big fake suit that Mother Jones won that cost them almost everything they had.
[02:22:37.489 --> 02:22:37.809]  Yeah.
[02:22:37.829 --> 02:22:38.790]  I don't agree with Mother Jones.
[02:22:39.090 --> 02:22:50.178]  You don't have to fame me, they have a First Amendment, but I think I'm going to send Mother Jones a donation for the First Amendment of $3, because there's a fake $3 bill, but I'm going to send them $3.
[02:22:50.318 --> 02:23:07.670]  Look, Mother Jones, I think no matter what you believe, I know Mother Jones is probably not your favorite publication, they've written negative things about me for people that I've represented, but when people want to say, I support these slap suits, I support these censorship suits against media,
[02:23:08.470 --> 02:23:10.592]  Because I don't like the media that's being sued.
[02:23:10.612 --> 02:23:11.693]  You've got to think about this.
[02:23:11.713 --> 02:23:16.518]  Like, if you create a weapon, you let a wild animal out of its cage and then get surprised when it attacks you.
[02:23:17.158 --> 02:23:18.280]  That's what's going to happen.
[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:21.403]  This case, this Mother Jones case, I mean, this was wrong.
[02:23:21.483 --> 02:23:23.685]  This was an unsupportable defamation suit.
[02:23:24.165 --> 02:23:28.449]  A billionaire sued the publication to try to punish them because he didn't like what they said about him.
[02:23:29.130 --> 02:23:36.013]  That case, eventually they won it, and Mother Jones is still, years later, begging for money to try to pay their legal defense fund.
[02:23:36.053 --> 02:23:49.098]  I mean, look, whether you write a $1 check, a $3 check, or a substantial check, you know, sending something to support them, I think that even if you hate Mother Jones, I think people listening to this show, I'm sure it's not the greatest, biggest number of, you know, Venn diagrams.
[02:23:49.538 --> 02:23:54.020]  But it's a great Hollywood style deal to get people thinking about, we all have to support the First Amendment.
[02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:55.601]  It's a nice stunt, I'm just Mother Jones for $3.
[02:23:56.021 --> 02:24:04.383]  When you don't like the speech and you see them trying to be suppressed, that should get your hackles up, because you're not making a donation to Mother Jones.
[02:24:04.403 --> 02:24:05.663]  And look, I don't get anything from that.
[02:24:05.723 --> 02:24:06.463]  They didn't hire me.
[02:24:06.903 --> 02:24:08.584]  But you make a donation to Mother Jones.
[02:24:08.624 --> 02:24:11.344]  You're not just making a donation to help that.
[02:24:11.404 --> 02:24:13.925]  What you're doing is you're standing up for the First Amendment.
[02:24:13.965 --> 02:24:17.826]  Well, you're cutting across party lines, because if we don't all support it, we're going to lose it.
[02:24:17.846 --> 02:24:20.026]  If we don't hang together, we're all going to hang separate.
[02:24:20.286 --> 02:24:26.331]  And that's why I look at your cases and I say, where the hell is the cavalry?
[02:24:26.951 --> 02:24:29.713]  Where is the New York Times?
[02:24:30.093 --> 02:24:31.154]  Where is CNN?
[02:24:31.614 --> 02:24:40.661]  Even if they want to report negatively on you, how do they not see that if this case goes forward, that that is a landmine that they're going to step on?
[02:24:41.001 --> 02:24:42.842]  They're bringing authoritarianism in.
[02:24:43.203 --> 02:24:44.644]  Google's officially moving to China.
[02:24:44.744 --> 02:24:45.544]  Apple already is.
[02:24:45.905 --> 02:24:49.948]  Google execs have leaked info saying, no, they're building censorship engines here.
[02:24:50.488 --> 02:24:51.549]  It's already here, Mark.
[02:24:51.569 --> 02:24:53.771]  We're going to go into a post-freedom world.
[02:24:54.051 --> 02:24:56.493]  The New York Times calls me the post-truth world.
[02:24:56.513 --> 02:24:58.974]  No, you're the post-truth world that lied about WMDs.
[02:24:59.255 --> 02:25:00.315]  The truth tried to come back.
[02:25:00.375 --> 02:25:01.997]  Now you're trying to silence everything.
[02:25:02.417 --> 02:25:03.418]  They're going for broke, Mark.
[02:25:03.458 --> 02:25:05.079]  They believe it's going to be selectively enforced.
[02:25:05.199 --> 02:25:09.700]  You know, I just don't, you know, I have these multiple alternate realities where we wind up.
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:17.282]  You know, I'm still hoping that eventually we wind up in a place where there's a... Not with Trump derangement syndrome, man.
[02:25:17.322 --> 02:25:22.663]  They said every news publication that's established that says he says all Mexicans are murderers and rapists.
[02:25:22.703 --> 02:25:23.564]  There is no video.
[02:25:23.744 --> 02:25:24.444]  There is no audio.
[02:25:24.644 --> 02:25:26.144]  They have committed to the dark side.
[02:25:26.604 --> 02:25:28.545]  They have joined Emperor Palpatine.
[02:25:28.625 --> 02:25:30.305]  It's their interpretation of it.
[02:25:30.345 --> 02:25:33.166]  But what I want to see is, you know, I'd love to see one day
[02:25:34.366 --> 02:25:41.890]  A hearing in one of your cases, and people standing out there protesting saying, support the First Amendment, even though I hate Alex Jones.
[02:25:43.271 --> 02:25:44.052]  That's a purist.
[02:25:44.272 --> 02:25:45.913]  There's maybe eight of us out there, I don't know.
[02:25:45.953 --> 02:25:50.215]  But those of you who believe that... Oh, well don't worry, we're going to call the troops out.
[02:25:50.796 --> 02:25:59.081]  But people listen to this show, you're by and large conservatives, but when you see something like this, when you see a case like this against a Mother Jones or against some other liberal media,
[02:25:59.841 --> 02:26:03.042]  You ought to be just as worked up as you are about this.
[02:26:03.082 --> 02:26:03.522]  No, exactly.
[02:26:03.542 --> 02:26:05.303]  You're trying to sell people on being American.
[02:26:05.823 --> 02:26:08.663]  And I'm telling you, on the left, they've totally... I can't believe I have to sell that!
[02:26:09.404 --> 02:26:10.304]  Let's expand on that.
[02:26:10.464 --> 02:26:21.127]  We've now spent a lot of money to have a big law firm here in Texas go through everything I've ever said, and the law firm itself, even liberals in the law firm, couldn't believe how the media and others have lied about what I said about Sandy Hook.
[02:26:21.567 --> 02:26:26.168]  It's incredible to see, Mark, the total deception.
[02:26:26.408 --> 02:26:28.089]  Yeah, I just...
[02:26:28.942 --> 02:26:33.208]  I just find it really depressing that, you know, as you said, yes, I'm trying to sell America.
[02:26:33.268 --> 02:26:34.990]  That's exactly what I'm marketing here.
[02:26:35.010 --> 02:26:39.256]  I mean, I'm, you know, I am not here trying to sell the right-wing point of view.
[02:26:39.276 --> 02:26:40.217]  I really don't.
[02:26:40.618 --> 02:26:41.779]  They're not going to listen to you.
[02:26:41.799 --> 02:26:42.560]  They're in a cult.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:43.562]  They're not liberals.
[02:26:43.942 --> 02:26:45.564]  Well, they're not virtuous people.
[02:26:45.584 --> 02:26:46.424]  They're control freaks.
[02:26:46.464 --> 02:26:47.085]  They're followers.
[02:26:47.505 --> 02:26:48.306]  Or they're controllers.
[02:26:49.127 --> 02:26:58.375]  The left is a corporate committed juggernaut plan funded by communist China that sells Buddhist and Christian organs for no reason.
[02:26:58.615 --> 02:26:59.796]  They're committed to evil.
[02:26:59.856 --> 02:27:00.657]  They have a plan.
[02:27:00.697 --> 02:27:01.318]  They're following it.
[02:27:01.778 --> 02:27:03.719]  I mean, I think, you know, I have a lighter view of it.
[02:27:03.799 --> 02:27:07.880]  I think a lot of the people on the left who, they believe they're doing the virtuous thing.
[02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:14.663]  They believe that, hey, you know, it's kind of like, look, the communists in Russia believed they were doing the right thing.
[02:27:14.683 --> 02:27:15.323]  Sure, here's what happens.
[02:27:15.423 --> 02:27:27.728]  If the average adult spends more than half their time waking on a screen or TV, they give them all the dopamine of feeling good and getting rewarded by Twitter, Facebook and Google when they say anti-American, anti-Alex Jones stuff.
[02:27:27.988 --> 02:27:29.429]  So they feel like they're winning.
[02:27:29.969 --> 02:27:36.514]  And they're all just scrabbling, wanting more dopamine, and so by successful approximation, they're incrementally trained in all this.
[02:27:36.694 --> 02:27:48.364]  Well, yeah, the rush that I think people get from beating up on somebody, you know, Huxley said something about, like, there's no better way to get people on your side than to give them license to be cruel to other people.
[02:27:49.084 --> 02:27:56.951]  And, you know, when I saw yesterday, I saw a news article about how many people were trying to petition Spotify to knock you off the platform.
[02:27:57.691 --> 02:28:03.274]  And there was no statement of irony in the article that half these people were in the media.
[02:28:03.634 --> 02:28:11.338]  When I see Soledad O'Brien trying to ask that you be kicked off of Spotify because she doesn't like your views, what in the hell is that?
[02:28:11.398 --> 02:28:13.479]  Does she not understand what business she's in?
[02:28:13.499 --> 02:28:16.660]  I mean, Soledad O'Brien could be the victim next.
[02:28:16.721 --> 02:28:19.482]  She thinks if she shuts down her competition, she'll have an audience.
[02:28:19.722 --> 02:28:21.223]  It's exactly because she does know.
[02:28:21.243 --> 02:28:23.324]  She's in the business of killing truth.
[02:28:23.584 --> 02:28:25.445]  She's in the business of murdering up freedom.
[02:28:25.845 --> 02:28:27.049]  Well, until they come for her.
[02:28:27.470 --> 02:28:28.694]  You know, that's the problem.
[02:28:29.215 --> 02:28:31.662]  Does nobody remember Pastor Niemoller?
[02:28:31.682 --> 02:28:32.645]  I mean, yeah, look at this!
[02:28:33.578 --> 02:28:35.359]  Mr. O'Brien, what the hell is wrong with you?
[02:28:35.379 --> 02:28:38.761]  I mean, a journalist saying that... But notice, he goes with the whole deal.
[02:28:38.781 --> 02:28:43.124]  They'll never report that I waived the fees that the Texas law triggers if they lose the suit.
[02:28:43.264 --> 02:28:43.924]  That's the law.
[02:28:44.204 --> 02:28:52.869]  Even then, even if this were true, even if you were seeking $100,000 or a billion dollars from them, why does that mean you should be knocked off of Spotify?
[02:28:53.490 --> 02:28:54.010]  So what?
[02:28:54.470 --> 02:28:58.853]  But that's the thing they're going to use, and they don't care that you were there, the lawyer got up, we're not doing that.
[02:28:58.873 --> 02:29:00.994]  No one's ever done that, but they don't care.
[02:29:07.051 --> 02:29:14.533]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[02:29:15.033 --> 02:29:28.137]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[02:29:29.597 --> 02:29:32.920]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through false spaces.
[02:29:33.401 --> 02:29:37.524]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[02:29:37.724 --> 02:29:41.728]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:58.634]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[02:29:58.855 --> 02:29:59.555]  InfoWars.
[02:29:59.936 --> 02:30:00.816]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:30:01.137 --> 02:30:01.577]  Today.
[02:30:02.398 --> 02:30:07.622]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWars Life.
[02:30:08.363 --> 02:30:11.664]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:30:12.524 --> 02:30:19.885]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:20.565 --> 02:30:26.907]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[02:30:27.707 --> 02:30:32.908]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:30:33.548 --> 02:30:51.892]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including Uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, Makaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[02:30:52.672 --> 02:30:56.173]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.
[02:30:56.793 --> 02:31:01.534]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle today.
[02:31:01.834 --> 02:31:06.115]  We need your support in this epic war against censorship.
[02:31:06.915 --> 02:31:21.719]  You have no idea the millions of dollars it will cost Alex Jones and InfoWars to fight the malicious, baseless harassment lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars across the country.
[02:31:22.519 --> 02:31:26.584]  These stories, these lawsuits have two purposes.
[02:31:27.345 --> 02:31:42.462]  One is to generate vicious negative headlines that can then be cited in turn as the basis for silencing our voices at YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter, and so on.
[02:31:43.403 --> 02:31:53.752]  It is going to cost literally millions of dollars to fight this Soros-funded onslaught against InfoWars.
[02:31:54.632 --> 02:31:56.294]  We cannot do it alone.
[02:31:57.174 --> 02:32:04.560]  Therefore, I ask you to go to the InfoWars site now and find the location where you can make a contribution.
[02:32:05.041 --> 02:32:09.605]  Go to the donation portion of the site and send us
[02:32:10.525 --> 02:32:14.527]  $50, or $100, or $250, or $500.
[02:32:15.787 --> 02:32:21.050]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as much as $1,000 or more.
[02:32:21.890 --> 02:32:22.250]  Why?
[02:32:22.390 --> 02:32:28.053]  Because they know that this is the single most important challenge we face.
[02:32:29.093 --> 02:32:43.720]  Whether we win in 2018 and 2020, whether we can keep the new American Revolution going, whether the free ideas expressed here at InfoWars are allowed to continue are really up to you.
[02:32:44.181 --> 02:32:46.582]  The entire question is up to you.
[02:32:47.262 --> 02:32:48.443]  We need your support.
[02:32:49.043 --> 02:32:52.365]  We do not exaggerate the stakes or the dangers.
[02:32:52.785 --> 02:32:54.326]  We are not crying wolf.
[02:32:55.276 --> 02:33:00.621]  Please go to the InfoWars.com site now and support us with your dollars.
[02:33:06.266 --> 02:33:08.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:48.504 --> 02:33:51.545]  Will Johnson, amazing patriot, down at AmericanFirst.com, about to join us.
[02:33:52.045 --> 02:33:56.167]  They are folks that have a lot of courage, just like Tommy Robinson and so many others.
[02:33:56.707 --> 02:34:04.209]  They go out and have prayer vigils in no-go zones like Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, California, and get attacked.
[02:34:04.269 --> 02:34:06.450]  And the antithesis says, try to intimidate everybody.
[02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:13.012]  Oh, the Nazis attacked us for no reason at the last rally in Portland, and so we're coming with guns.
[02:34:14.793 --> 02:34:16.954]  I mean, it's like if I walked over,
[02:34:17.970 --> 02:34:18.691]  And I wouldn't do this.
[02:34:18.871 --> 02:34:19.912]  Me, you'll say I'm threatening this.
[02:34:19.952 --> 02:34:23.175]  And I punched Will Johnson in the nose for no reason.
[02:34:23.875 --> 02:34:25.797]  And then Will Johnson punched me and knocked me down.
[02:34:25.817 --> 02:34:28.659]  And I went, that Nazi just beat me up!
[02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:32.723]  Everybody can see he's not a Nazi and you just punched him first.
[02:34:32.783 --> 02:34:35.425]  So, we'll go ahead in a minute.
[02:34:36.726 --> 02:34:39.048]  I'm trying to understand what's going on with Trump.
[02:34:39.729 --> 02:34:43.792]  Where he's like, the Russians are meddling in the election right now.
[02:34:43.872 --> 02:34:44.293]  We agree.
[02:34:44.313 --> 02:34:45.374]  We're not going to let them meddle.
[02:34:46.425 --> 02:34:49.908]  And we're going to give federal funds to local governments to block it.
[02:34:49.968 --> 02:34:50.928]  But I do know what's going on.
[02:34:51.769 --> 02:34:57.934]  Trump's been trying to get funding to stop the illegal aliens voting in the names of dead people and the Democrats and all the scams they're running.
[02:34:57.954 --> 02:35:02.617]  So it's like, oh, you want Homeland Security to oversee the elections, huh?
[02:35:03.238 --> 02:35:04.239]  OK, we'll do it.
[02:35:04.919 --> 02:35:06.821]  He hasn't repealed Obama's executive order.
[02:35:08.102 --> 02:35:16.068]  All 50 attorney generals wrote letters, including Democrats, saying this is a violation of the Federalist Act and the laws and federalism.
[02:35:17.628 --> 02:35:18.588]  You can't do this!
[02:35:18.709 --> 02:35:28.093]  So... I mean, I get that Trump wants to watch the elections and knows the Democrats are famous for trying to steal them and Project Veritas caught all those videos, but...
[02:35:29.639 --> 02:35:32.121]  Going along with the whole Russian thing just kind of adds to it.
[02:35:32.181 --> 02:35:32.902]  It's ridiculous.
[02:35:32.942 --> 02:35:34.583]  Does Russia try to get involved in our elections?
[02:35:35.384 --> 02:35:36.765]  Yeah, every major country does it.
[02:35:37.245 --> 02:35:38.506]  We do it massively to them.
[02:35:38.606 --> 02:35:39.327]  I think it's wrong.
[02:35:40.267 --> 02:35:40.988]  But it goes on.
[02:35:41.068 --> 02:35:46.072]  But mainly foundations and groups send money over to Russia and then send money back here.
[02:35:46.092 --> 02:35:50.075]  Because there's massive amounts of money being used to try to overthrow the Russian government.
[02:35:50.115 --> 02:35:50.896]  That's admitted.
[02:35:51.216 --> 02:35:52.077]  About $5 billion a year.
[02:35:53.103 --> 02:35:53.884]  They have press briefings.
[02:35:54.144 --> 02:35:58.749]  The State Department, when Obama was in, about how they spent $5 billion in one year to overthrow Ukraine.
[02:35:59.230 --> 02:36:00.111]  An elected government!
[02:36:00.731 --> 02:36:02.513]  And then they say Trump's involved in that.
[02:36:03.154 --> 02:36:07.358]  The Russians came into Ukraine because they have a stake there, and the elected government was overthrown.
[02:36:07.378 --> 02:36:11.243]  I'm not defending that, but I'm sure not saying they don't have a right to do it.
[02:36:11.283 --> 02:36:14.086]  Crimea's where Russia was founded, but I'm digressing.
[02:36:15.865 --> 02:36:17.666]  He will do anything to win the election 2020.
[02:36:17.746 --> 02:36:18.847]  We must stop him.
[02:36:19.547 --> 02:36:20.407]  Demand voter ID.
[02:36:20.648 --> 02:36:22.609]  And of course, that's the big joke.
[02:36:22.649 --> 02:36:23.869]  We've been putting those tweets out.
[02:36:24.370 --> 02:36:25.490]  We've been putting those memes out.
[02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:26.150]  So have others.
[02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:26.711]  Democrats.
[02:36:27.271 --> 02:36:28.252]  Change that matters.
[02:36:29.772 --> 02:36:33.494]  And we've got to have voter ID, which is what the Democrats don't want, because they admit they have illegal aliens.
[02:36:33.815 --> 02:36:36.716]  Remember Brandon Tatum warning about this?
[02:36:36.756 --> 02:36:37.757]  Remember me warning about it?
[02:36:37.797 --> 02:36:39.818]  Remember everybody, just last year we talked about
[02:36:40.598 --> 02:36:43.040]  How the Democrats want illegal aliens to vote won't legalize it.
[02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:43.800]  Trump will talk about it.
[02:36:43.821 --> 02:36:44.561]  Everybody talked about it.
[02:36:45.041 --> 02:36:46.422]  They'd say, oh we're making it up.
[02:36:47.063 --> 02:36:52.347]  Now the Democrats everywhere admit universal voting for any illegal alien that can get here and total open borders.
[02:36:53.128 --> 02:36:57.451]  So don't let Russia intervene, folks.
[02:36:57.551 --> 02:36:59.072]  We've got to have voter ID.
[02:36:59.112 --> 02:37:01.254]  The Russian agents are everywhere voting for Trump.
[02:37:02.775 --> 02:37:04.116]  Hashtag demand voter ID.
[02:37:04.296 --> 02:37:04.656]  Yes!
[02:37:05.497 --> 02:37:07.038]  There are Russians everywhere.
[02:37:07.138 --> 02:37:07.939]  I saw one.
[02:37:08.579 --> 02:37:09.060]  One time.
[02:37:10.421 --> 02:37:13.943]  Does it matter they work for Army Special Operations and are highly decorated?
[02:37:13.983 --> 02:37:16.604]  You cannot trust anyone of a Russian background.
[02:37:16.844 --> 02:37:18.905]  They are going to pose as illegal aliens.
[02:37:19.306 --> 02:37:20.586]  They're going to vote the names of dead people.
[02:37:20.606 --> 02:37:22.407]  Those are not illegal aliens.
[02:37:22.427 --> 02:37:24.908]  Those are Russians dressed up like illegal aliens.
[02:37:24.928 --> 02:37:25.669]  They're everywhere!
[02:37:26.912 --> 02:37:27.373]  One right here.
[02:37:27.993 --> 02:37:32.619]  So, Will Johnson's here, UnitedAmericaFirst.com, great patriot.
[02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:35.303]  He founded it back in 2016 when he saw what was going on.
[02:37:35.323 --> 02:37:45.135]  Again, what do you make of, I've noticed the anti-fla blogs in Portland say, as I mentioned earlier, I've already read this on air yesterday,
[02:37:46.036 --> 02:37:50.638]  The Nazis keep attacking minorities and LGBT.
[02:37:51.178 --> 02:37:53.079]  They attacked a bunch of them last time.
[02:37:53.099 --> 02:37:54.239]  We're bringing out the guns.
[02:37:54.739 --> 02:37:55.720]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:58.841]  Everyone saw them attack you guys, and you're not Nazis.
[02:37:58.941 --> 02:38:00.122]  It's unbelievable.
[02:38:00.142 --> 02:38:01.062]  So are they delusional?
[02:38:01.302 --> 02:38:01.962]  Are they liars?
[02:38:02.042 --> 02:38:03.623]  What in the world is going on with these people?
[02:38:04.779 --> 02:38:06.180]  They're completely liars.
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:19.811]  Just imagine if you're at a picnic with your family, and people find out that you're at a picnic with your family, and then they come up there and they start throwing rocks at you, start throwing bottles at you, start trying to hit you with sticks, and you take one of them out, and then they're gonna report it.
[02:38:19.931 --> 02:38:21.913]  Alex Jones attacked someone at a park.
[02:38:22.566 --> 02:38:24.488]  See, that's exactly what they're doing here.
[02:38:24.908 --> 02:38:27.490]  We're not inviting these people to come and be violent with us.
[02:38:27.550 --> 02:38:29.692]  We're not inviting them to come there and fight with us.
[02:38:30.052 --> 02:38:31.453]  We're not inviting them at all.
[02:38:31.933 --> 02:38:38.919]  But they want to show up at an event that we are having and be violent towards us, and then you have the mainstream media saying that we're the ones being violent.
[02:38:39.679 --> 02:38:41.100]  They are completely insane.
[02:38:41.341 --> 02:38:42.822]  They have lost their mind.
[02:38:45.464 --> 02:38:46.264]  I totally agree.
[02:38:46.304 --> 02:38:47.746]  We're going to go right back to you in a moment.
[02:38:47.766 --> 02:38:48.766]  We have breaking news here.
[02:38:49.187 --> 02:38:50.448]  This is not me saying this.
[02:38:51.718 --> 02:39:04.463]  They always misrepresent what I say when there's anomalies, like the cops stood down in Parkland, and then we covered it, and then they said that we said nobody died, but then they deleted the video so you couldn't see it.
[02:39:04.884 --> 02:39:18.969]  This is ABC News, CBS News, I've got a bunch of these here, this is WPAFB, live coverage, WHIOU,
[02:39:20.580 --> 02:39:22.541]  And I heard them saying this during the break, and I'm like, what?
[02:39:22.681 --> 02:39:23.881]  They're like, no, no, we're not kidding.
[02:39:24.921 --> 02:39:33.604]  We've been told by law enforcement, this is 7 News, in Ohio, at the Air Force Base, who have told us varying reports.
[02:39:34.344 --> 02:39:40.106]  One law enforcement official told us, on the record, that the incident started as a training exercise.
[02:39:40.406 --> 02:39:40.826]  Oh no.
[02:39:42.667 --> 02:39:44.247]  Oh no, that's, that's not good.
[02:39:44.287 --> 02:39:44.947]  You know what that means.
[02:39:45.607 --> 02:39:47.408]  The officials, just like they, oh boy.
[02:39:49.537 --> 02:39:52.919]  And then Drudge had the story up and took it down, so we're not sure about this.
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:40:00.064]  The official said something happened during the training and someone fired shots to get into a door that they could not get into.
[02:40:00.865 --> 02:40:04.567]  Another source said there's a situation with hostages and shots were fired.
[02:40:04.627 --> 02:40:09.490]  Someone tried to break out of the window or windows to get people out of the hospital.
[02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:16.395]  The source said that the base is asking for canines, not more law enforcement.
[02:40:16.455 --> 02:40:17.596]  This doesn't sound too good.
[02:40:18.735 --> 02:40:24.820]  And I was told by Pentagon source, I tweeted it out at 6 a.m., expect all hell to break loose.
[02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:29.683]  This Pentagon source was telling me about Fort Hood being staged, and they were there.
[02:40:30.564 --> 02:40:32.025]  And I'm going to leave it at that right now.
[02:40:32.125 --> 02:40:33.326]  So let's pray for everybody.
[02:40:33.386 --> 02:40:36.328]  Hopefully this is just a mistake.
[02:40:36.388 --> 02:40:37.068]  Nobody's been hurt.
[02:40:37.148 --> 02:40:38.389]  We're not saying it's a drill.
[02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:39.550]  That is in the news.
[02:40:40.431 --> 02:40:41.672]  They will say that I said it's that.
[02:40:42.392 --> 02:40:43.253]  That is not what I said.
[02:40:44.033 --> 02:40:45.795]  Will Johnson, please continue, sir.
[02:40:47.349 --> 02:40:49.370]  You know, I want to say this, Mr. Jones.
[02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:56.233]  One of the reasons why they're attacking you is because you have influenced so many people to start speaking up.
[02:40:56.753 --> 02:41:02.035]  I used to listen to you over 10 years ago, even before Obama came into picture.
[02:41:02.435 --> 02:41:03.836]  And I was like, who is this guy?
[02:41:03.896 --> 02:41:06.437]  He's saying everything that is completely true.
[02:41:06.957 --> 02:41:07.317]  I couldn't
[02:41:07.857 --> 02:41:09.719]  And I started going to look at different things.
[02:41:09.779 --> 02:41:11.200]  I started verifying it for myself.
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:12.661]  It's what he's saying is true.
[02:41:12.901 --> 02:41:14.162]  And it happened to be true.
[02:41:14.502 --> 02:41:18.945]  And then some of the stuff you were saying what they were going to do, and then years later it became true.
[02:41:19.365 --> 02:41:21.066]  See, they are so afraid of you.
[02:41:21.106 --> 02:41:22.988]  That's the reason why they're attacking you.
[02:41:23.288 --> 02:41:29.032]  That's the reason why they want to remove you from every platform possible because they fear you.
[02:41:29.572 --> 02:41:33.614]  Have you ever known for them to be so scared of one man before?
[02:41:33.914 --> 02:41:34.754]  They're scared of you.
[02:41:34.774 --> 02:41:36.215]  They're scared of Donald J. Trump.
[02:41:36.495 --> 02:41:41.958]  And now they're scared of the American people because the American people are waking up to what is actually happening here.
[02:41:42.198 --> 02:41:45.799]  And I want to thank you personally for speaking out, for having the courage.
[02:41:45.839 --> 02:41:47.160]  And I know you hear it all the time.
[02:41:47.260 --> 02:41:47.880]  I hear it too.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:48.741]  But you know what?
[02:41:48.801 --> 02:41:53.523]  It's going to take people like you, myself, Brandon Tatum, multiple people.
[02:41:54.103 --> 02:42:00.930]  To keep fighting this good fight, because if we don't, we're going to wake up one morning and we're going to wonder what happened to our country.
[02:42:01.011 --> 02:42:01.831]  Well, God bless you.
[02:42:01.851 --> 02:42:03.073]  People are always thanking me.
[02:42:03.153 --> 02:42:05.595]  I appreciate listeners that are involved, and I don't want to make it about me.
[02:42:05.615 --> 02:42:08.078]  I want to make it about them, because you guys are the victory.
[02:42:08.338 --> 02:42:11.501]  But now, I've been so persecuted now, I used to get tired of it.
[02:42:11.521 --> 02:42:12.522]  I actually kind of like it now.
[02:42:13.336 --> 02:42:14.577]  Because, I mean, it's gotten bad.
[02:42:14.597 --> 02:42:15.878]  I can't even tell people behind the scenes.
[02:42:15.898 --> 02:42:16.979]  People think it's bad on air.
[02:42:17.479 --> 02:42:19.680]  I mean, I just get on my knees every day, and sometimes I cry.
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:20.601]  And I'm not trying to be a wimp here.
[02:42:20.641 --> 02:42:27.366]  It's... God, the way they lie, what they've done to my family, and I... But again, it makes me glad I did this, because it really proves we were right about these people.
[02:42:27.586 --> 02:42:33.690]  And then I see people like you that have the courage to go out there in the face of this evil scum, where the police protect them in these evil cities.
[02:42:34.050 --> 02:42:36.692]  That really... It really makes me feel strong to know you're there.
[02:42:37.052 --> 02:42:39.154]  I'm telling you, to see more and more people
[02:42:39.694 --> 02:42:46.519]  Taking action makes me feel good to know that no matter what happens to me, I already dropped the bomb on the target in the InfoWars.
[02:42:46.859 --> 02:42:53.184]  And so even if they're going to take me out, when they shovel me in my grave at the end of the day, I win because my children and your children win together.
[02:42:53.204 --> 02:42:54.865]  WillJohnsonUnitedAmericaFirst.com.
[02:42:55.125 --> 02:42:55.566]  Trade ahead.
[02:42:55.646 --> 02:42:57.007]  We're with InfoWars.com.
[02:42:57.407 --> 02:42:58.768]  We appreciate all of what you're doing.
[02:43:05.775 --> 02:43:17.927]  You know, President Trump talks about how we need to be trailblazers, how we need to be outsiders, how we need to expose the current stagnant system that's been suppressing us, wanting to make us poor so we can consolidate control and buy us up for pennies on the dollar.
[02:43:17.967 --> 02:43:19.509]  That really is the globalist system.
[02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:22.011]  He's absolutely right.
[02:43:22.111 --> 02:43:28.337]  So it is an honor to be persecuted by the globalists, to be lied about, to be demonized.
[02:43:29.850 --> 02:43:39.097]  It's an honor to draw them out so we can show who they are so that you take action and you take the country back politically, culturally, spiritually, financially.
[02:43:39.337 --> 02:43:44.841]  Another hero is Julian Assange, who's been in solitary confinement in a closet-sized room.
[02:43:44.861 --> 02:43:48.144]  They converted a closet with a bed and enough room for a laptop.
[02:43:48.284 --> 02:43:49.905]  They took that away over a year ago.
[02:43:50.345 --> 02:43:52.227]  No communication with the outside.
[02:43:52.247 --> 02:44:10.320]  It's all been one hell of a time for him, and he was very bipartisan in that he exposed Republicans, he exposed Democrats, he very judiciously released information that exposed criminal activity of the NSA, criminal activity of the CIA, illegal spying on Congress, illegal spying on Trump, illegal spying on me.
[02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:19.047]  But they had my home number, my old cell, my new cell, and my office line, and they had Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago private apartment number that I
[02:44:19.227 --> 02:44:25.952]  I had total proof of Obama spying on Trump and yours truly a decade ago.
[02:44:25.992 --> 02:44:27.893]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the real deal.
[02:44:28.013 --> 02:44:32.216]  And America's had freedom so long, people don't recognize real tyranny when it hits them right between the eyes.
[02:44:32.396 --> 02:44:35.538]  But everyone needs to go to Infowars.com.
[02:44:35.618 --> 02:44:37.899]  The article is right up there at the top of the page, red link.
[02:44:38.020 --> 02:44:38.920]  Petition to Trump.
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:40.061]  Pardon Julian Assange.
[02:44:40.141 --> 02:44:44.404]  And we go over the fact that he engaged in regular journalistic activity and did a wonderful job.
[02:44:44.684 --> 02:44:45.184]  I think so.
[02:45:04.622 --> 02:45:07.645]  Shame it's any one person, but without any of us together, it wouldn't have happened.
[02:45:07.705 --> 02:45:11.087]  So, we need the president to pardon Julian Assange.
[02:45:11.188 --> 02:45:14.530]  And you said in a speech, I don't care who got her illegal server.
[02:45:14.791 --> 02:45:15.351]  It's illegal.
[02:45:15.531 --> 02:45:16.932]  It's about what she did that's wrong.
[02:45:17.132 --> 02:45:18.073]  Don't change the subject.
[02:45:18.293 --> 02:45:19.715]  Go back to that instinct, sir.
[02:45:20.135 --> 02:45:21.736]  But you told Assange, release it.
[02:45:22.457 --> 02:45:23.918]  You said release more stuff.
[02:45:24.378 --> 02:45:25.419]  And he's in the crosshairs.
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:29.463]  And he needs to be pardoned if he's brought back to the United States.
[02:45:32.358 --> 02:45:36.059]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:45:36.199 --> 02:45:41.260]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:42.580]  And here's the best part.
[02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:44.361]  It is absolutely free.
[02:45:44.581 --> 02:45:49.542]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:45:49.782 --> 02:45:53.663]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:45:53.743 --> 02:45:57.644]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[02:45:57.864 --> 02:46:01.965]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:46:02.445 --> 02:46:09.711]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:46:10.092 --> 02:46:17.618]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:46:18.018 --> 02:46:21.101]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:46:21.741 --> 02:46:26.002]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:46:26.362 --> 02:46:30.283]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:46:30.523 --> 02:46:33.224]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:46:33.644 --> 02:46:37.925]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:46:38.405 --> 02:46:41.466]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:46:41.866 --> 02:46:56.711]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you, and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[02:46:56.951 --> 02:46:58.232]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:46:58.472 --> 02:47:00.932]  We will prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[02:47:05.714 --> 02:47:08.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.575 --> 02:47:16.416]  I've said this so many times when I say it again.
[02:47:16.436 --> 02:47:22.962]  During the break, I went back there, got a glass of water, went in the bathroom to shake off the lily.
[02:47:24.122 --> 02:47:26.563]  And it just hit me like, Alex, God loves you.
[02:47:27.104 --> 02:47:27.784]  You're good.
[02:47:28.324 --> 02:47:29.325]  You're trying to be good.
[02:47:29.765 --> 02:47:30.586]  You've got strength.
[02:47:30.666 --> 02:47:31.426]  You've got courage.
[02:47:31.886 --> 02:47:34.488]  Here, whatever level of strength you need, it's there.
[02:47:34.508 --> 02:47:35.408]  It's already there.
[02:47:35.869 --> 02:47:37.970]  They don't know how good God is.
[02:47:38.010 --> 02:47:39.511]  They don't know it's all waiting for them.
[02:47:39.971 --> 02:47:41.011]  They don't know it's all there.
[02:47:41.031 --> 02:47:43.293]  And it's like, we want to take all these people with us.
[02:47:44.233 --> 02:47:45.314]  But a lot of them don't want to come.
[02:47:46.314 --> 02:47:47.055]  And that's okay.
[02:47:47.655 --> 02:47:48.736]  You've got the birthright.
[02:47:48.756 --> 02:47:49.736]  You've got the inheritance.
[02:47:49.756 --> 02:47:51.337]  You can go cash the check.
[02:47:52.017 --> 02:47:52.938]  You were given the check.
[02:47:53.738 --> 02:47:58.061]  It's got the signature on it, spiritually written, emblazoned in gold.
[02:47:59.261 --> 02:48:02.363]  But you have to take the check, and you have to deposit it.
[02:48:02.383 --> 02:48:10.627]  I mean, you don't think in the whole universe, with all these dimensions above us and below us, and all the secrets of everything, you just think you're just given that?
[02:48:11.648 --> 02:48:11.768]  No.
[02:48:22.808 --> 02:48:29.569]  Take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:48:31.310 --> 02:48:35.490]  If you're a TV viewer, you got to see that.
[02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:37.231]  Really, really great work that Drew did.
[02:48:37.251 --> 02:48:38.251]  He's a great animator.
[02:48:38.811 --> 02:48:40.331]  He likes to do fun stuff, too.
[02:48:40.351 --> 02:48:42.672]  A little bit self-deprecating, but it's fun.
[02:48:43.072 --> 02:48:44.952]  Will Johnson's with us here on AmericanFirst.com.
[02:48:45.352 --> 02:48:47.613]  We're trying to figure out what went on at this Air Force base.
[02:48:48.730 --> 02:48:50.271]  Uh, in Ohio.
[02:48:51.912 --> 02:48:53.453]  And, I mean, no one knows, so.
[02:48:54.013 --> 02:48:56.994]  I haven't heard that a bunch of people have been killed, so that's certainly good news.
[02:48:58.095 --> 02:48:59.075]  But, but, you're right.
[02:48:59.196 --> 02:49:05.779]  That's what scares them, Will Johnson, is that I inspired other people, because I knew that was important.
[02:49:06.219 --> 02:49:10.762]  You've inspired other people, and then when they come out and bully people, you guys aren't looking for trouble.
[02:49:11.282 --> 02:49:12.943]  I mean, it's Antifa everywhere.
[02:49:13.888 --> 02:49:17.931]  Well, I've had them come up to me, like when I'm in a restaurant, because I know they're antifa.
[02:49:17.951 --> 02:49:23.235]  It's always like professors or they're, you know, they're students and it's always, F you Nazi or Russian agent.
[02:49:23.696 --> 02:49:25.437]  And I'm like, I'm not a Nazi or a Russian agent.
[02:49:25.717 --> 02:49:26.318]  And they don't care.
[02:49:26.358 --> 02:49:30.321]  It's like once they say that to you, it's their license to be thugs and hateful.
[02:49:30.801 --> 02:49:32.302]  So what they really are is a bunch of losers.
[02:49:32.342 --> 02:49:37.166]  And then they can't believe when they attack somebody, they always get their ass kicked, even when they attack a woman.
[02:49:39.795 --> 02:49:42.276]  And then they bitch and complain and say, you attacked me.
[02:49:43.397 --> 02:49:47.458]  Even liberal media, even Nancy Pelosi has to admit they're starting the fights and attacking people.
[02:49:47.718 --> 02:49:49.279]  So what do you expect to come up this weekend?
[02:49:49.579 --> 02:49:50.460]  How do people go there?
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:52.841]  I got a bunch of articles actually about what you're doing.
[02:49:52.881 --> 02:49:54.141]  I meant to cover, but then I got busy.
[02:49:54.421 --> 02:49:54.801]  Here it is.
[02:49:55.882 --> 02:50:00.784]  Portland mayor under fire for PD failure to answer 9-11 calls from ICE office.
[02:50:00.804 --> 02:50:07.667]  So you're there right after that happened, but they're attacking this food truck because the lady's selling people food to come out of the building.
[02:50:09.352 --> 02:50:11.252]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:50:12.293 --> 02:50:13.213]  Here's the SPLC.
[02:50:13.233 --> 02:50:16.134]  What do you know about the upcoming far-right rallies in the Pacific Northwest?
[02:50:16.674 --> 02:50:18.754]  Oh my gosh, these evil patriot people.
[02:50:19.415 --> 02:50:20.375]  It's so sick.
[02:50:21.735 --> 02:50:25.316]  Oregon far-right protests move to location to allow carrying guns?
[02:50:26.736 --> 02:50:29.737]  Well, you guys are known for saying you're not offensively violent.
[02:50:30.117 --> 02:50:36.059]  But I really wouldn't want to be Antifa who already got caught with guns, clubs, and knives a few weeks ago.
[02:50:36.099 --> 02:50:36.919]  So what are you expecting?
[02:50:38.849 --> 02:50:42.933]  I'm expecting them to come out and act completely insane, completely crazy.
[02:50:42.993 --> 02:50:46.256]  You know, it would be to their interest for them not to even show up.
[02:50:46.576 --> 02:50:53.462]  If Antifa, BLM, BAM, and all the rest of the anti-American hate group don't even show up, the media won't even cover it.
[02:50:53.783 --> 02:50:55.024]  It won't even be a story.
[02:50:55.324 --> 02:50:59.588]  But see, they can't help themselves because they want to intimidate the American people.
[02:50:59.848 --> 02:51:02.150]  That's the very reason why they attack a food truck.
[02:51:02.370 --> 02:51:05.113]  They simply want to provide a service to people to eat.
[02:51:05.914 --> 02:51:13.079]  They want to intimidate everybody that they can that loves this country, that respects the president, and that loves the truth.
[02:51:13.719 --> 02:51:16.461]  They can care less about anything that is right.
[02:51:17.101 --> 02:51:17.922]  And by the way, you're right.
[02:51:17.962 --> 02:51:20.183]  They're obsessed with not just deplatforming.
[02:51:20.203 --> 02:51:22.305]  This is on the news when they're calling everybody N-word.
[02:51:22.845 --> 02:51:28.369]  They then run over and like, I'm sort of tagging a food truck because it's selling food next to a federal building.
[02:51:28.829 --> 02:51:31.491]  They're obsessed with controlling the means of production.
[02:51:31.631 --> 02:51:32.271]  They're communists.
[02:51:32.491 --> 02:51:33.552]  They want to run it all.
[02:51:34.853 --> 02:51:35.533]  Exactly.
[02:51:35.553 --> 02:51:36.614]  You're exactly right.
[02:51:37.234 --> 02:51:50.242]  Why is it that I can go out on the street and hold an American flag and people tell me I'm number one as they ride by, or I get people who want to physically attack me because I'm holding the American flag in the United States of America?
[02:51:50.502 --> 02:51:53.484]  Now, if I went to Cuba or if I went to North Korea,
[02:51:53.804 --> 02:52:00.048]  Or even if I went to Mexico and I would hold up the American flag talking about this is my land or I need rights here.
[02:52:00.468 --> 02:52:06.111]  They will probably put me in prison and never be seen again for simply holding up an American flag in this country.
[02:52:06.412 --> 02:52:08.033]  And now they're trying to do the same thing here.
[02:52:08.453 --> 02:52:10.214]  Portland is the same thing.
[02:52:10.634 --> 02:52:13.176]  Berkeley, Sunday, will be the same thing.
[02:52:13.236 --> 02:52:18.719]  They do not want people to stand freely in any venue or any place.
[02:52:19.506 --> 02:52:22.867]  Why do it if they, like I said a second ago, just don't show up?
[02:52:23.087 --> 02:52:24.368]  The media won't even talk about it.
[02:52:24.408 --> 02:52:26.229]  We won't get any attention from the media.
[02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:33.872]  But because they show up and want to be violent and control the narrative and control what people see, think and believe, that's why they can't help themselves.
[02:52:33.912 --> 02:52:36.193]  And that's why they're going to show up to try to harm us.
[02:52:36.473 --> 02:52:37.713]  We're not trying to harm anybody.
[02:52:38.093 --> 02:52:39.854]  They are the ones trying to harm everybody.
[02:52:40.214 --> 02:52:43.296]  They are the violent ones and it's been like that from every sense.
[02:52:43.336 --> 02:52:48.079]  The Democrats, the domestic terrorist Democrats, have been doing this to black people for the longest.
[02:52:48.339 --> 02:52:50.840]  And now here it is, they call black people the N-word.
[02:52:51.121 --> 02:52:52.541]  But see, it's okay when they do it.
[02:52:52.882 --> 02:52:54.603]  The liberals, it's okay when they do it.
[02:52:54.683 --> 02:52:58.645]  But if someone else does it, that's when it becomes a whole complete different picture.
[02:52:58.985 --> 02:53:00.726]  Oh, you're being hateful, you're being racist.
[02:53:00.946 --> 02:53:01.887]  Which is not true.
[02:53:02.227 --> 02:53:03.648]  It is the left that is racist.
[02:53:03.708 --> 02:53:04.929]  They call us what they are.
[02:53:05.509 --> 02:53:06.870]  It's unbelievable.
[02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:08.611]  Why can't any of them fight?
[02:53:10.703 --> 02:53:12.985]  Well, that's a really good question.
[02:53:13.245 --> 02:53:17.808]  I think they sit behind their Xbox and their PS4s all day and like, oh, look what I'm doing.
[02:53:17.828 --> 02:53:18.489]  Look what I'm doing.
[02:53:18.689 --> 02:53:22.852]  And then they fix it in their mind that, you know, they believe that they're warriors all of a sudden.
[02:53:22.872 --> 02:53:25.073]  Like, I can go out here and I can do this and I can do that.
[02:53:25.234 --> 02:53:29.877]  Because they're sitting in mommy and daddy's basement all day playing a video game, thinking now they're all of a sudden warriors.
[02:53:30.470 --> 02:53:31.411]  We don't want to hurt them.
[02:53:31.451 --> 02:53:32.652]  They are someone's child.
[02:53:32.693 --> 02:53:41.882]  They're someone's children that's been deceived by a professor at a liberal college that have them to believe that the American people, the American flag is bad.
[02:53:41.922 --> 02:53:42.323]  You know what?
[02:53:42.443 --> 02:53:43.604]  I love that American flag.
[02:53:43.985 --> 02:53:47.889]  That American flag is what shows, represents freedom for all of us.
[02:53:48.389 --> 02:53:50.531]  That flag is the flag that won the Civil War.
[02:53:50.912 --> 02:53:54.155]  That's the reason why I'm able to stand here today and talk to you.
[02:53:54.655 --> 02:53:56.697]  Because of that flag, what it represents.
[02:53:56.917 --> 02:53:59.299]  And over a million people died in the Civil War.
[02:53:59.320 --> 02:54:01.622]  We lost more people in that war than any other war.
[02:54:03.772 --> 02:54:04.893]  Exactly, and guess what?
[02:54:04.913 --> 02:54:08.517]  The majority of them were white people, trying to help black people.
[02:54:08.697 --> 02:54:10.138]  But see, they don't want to talk about that.
[02:54:10.158 --> 02:54:17.706]  They want to talk about how white people today are all of a sudden a problem, which we all know is not true, but they have to push this narrative because they don't have anything.
[02:54:17.966 --> 02:54:20.088]  They don't even have anything to stand on.
[02:54:20.308 --> 02:54:26.895]  That's why they still talk about... Exactly, going back to Civil War, there were bad things on both sides, but bottom line, it was Christian abolitionists
[02:54:27.375 --> 02:54:31.178]  Who in 1800 were 1% of the population who said it was wrong.
[02:54:31.218 --> 02:54:34.220]  And then that became the impetus for part of the Civil War.
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:36.681]  But regardless, there were trade disputes and everything else.
[02:54:36.761 --> 02:54:38.242]  But slavery was wrong.
[02:54:38.522 --> 02:54:42.325]  It was Christians in Europe, in England, in here that said we've got to stop it.
[02:54:42.865 --> 02:54:44.567]  And then they were the people that led the charge.
[02:54:44.887 --> 02:54:48.089]  And just 68 years later, slavery was banned.
[02:54:48.149 --> 02:54:49.250]  It didn't mean everything was fixed then.
[02:54:49.530 --> 02:54:53.072]  But the point was, it was Christians in America that fought and died.
[02:54:53.092 --> 02:54:56.915]  And they went from 1% to the majority in the North and many in the South.
[02:54:57.535 --> 02:54:59.137]  And that shows how we're going to win too.
[02:54:59.197 --> 02:55:02.080]  Just like 3% started the war against King George.
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:05.403]  Doesn't mean we were perfect back then either, but he was even worse.
[02:55:05.644 --> 02:55:08.286]  So it's a progression as we learn to get more liberty.
[02:55:08.567 --> 02:55:10.388]  And America's been more free than any other country.
[02:55:10.629 --> 02:55:13.031]  So the universities teach us to hate it.
[02:55:13.391 --> 02:55:17.215]  They don't teach us any of the good things about the country because they are globalists.
[02:55:17.436 --> 02:55:18.517]  They are against the country.
[02:55:19.901 --> 02:55:20.801]  You're absolutely right.
[02:55:21.161 --> 02:55:26.963]  During the Civil War and when they had the Underground Railroad, I always ask people, I said, who was running the Underground Railroad?
[02:55:26.983 --> 02:55:27.803]  Was it black people?
[02:55:28.083 --> 02:55:29.884]  Did black people own homes back then?
[02:55:29.944 --> 02:55:31.204]  No, it was white people.
[02:55:31.484 --> 02:55:32.785]  See, they don't want to acknowledge that.
[02:55:32.825 --> 02:55:34.725]  And when you bring that up, they all shut down.
[02:55:34.965 --> 02:55:36.566]  And then they start talking about something else.
[02:55:36.946 --> 02:55:44.288]  They, the Democrat Party, the domestic terrorist group in this country, the Democratic Party, they are angry at white Republicans
[02:55:44.628 --> 02:55:44.768]  I don't
[02:56:11.473 --> 02:56:17.378]  You guys, you always speak the truth, and they don't like it, and you have to destroy the truth.
[02:56:17.618 --> 02:56:18.499]  I mean, Hitler said it.
[02:56:18.979 --> 02:56:23.202]  Tell a lie, and tell it enough, and people will believe it.
[02:56:23.822 --> 02:56:25.804]  Tell the truth, and they will get angry with you.
[02:56:25.904 --> 02:56:27.225]  That's why the truth always hurts.
[02:56:27.365 --> 02:56:29.327]  And I know you're about to get in the car and drive up to Portland.
[02:56:29.347 --> 02:56:32.309]  I want to come out and do five more minutes with you about how people can support you, how they can come out.
[02:56:32.789 --> 02:56:34.891]  I don't think that, you know, Antifa is going to shoot anybody.
[02:56:34.931 --> 02:56:35.851]  The police are going to be out there.
[02:56:35.871 --> 02:56:36.552]  They're going to be watching.
[02:56:36.812 --> 02:56:37.813]  There's all these lawsuits.
[02:56:37.853 --> 02:56:39.054]  The police, I think, this week,
[02:56:39.554 --> 02:56:40.996]  We'll see if I'm wrong when we come back.
[02:56:41.036 --> 02:56:41.857]  We'll find out Saturday.
[02:56:41.957 --> 02:56:44.920]  Owen and Drew and others are about to fly out in the morning tomorrow.
[02:56:45.281 --> 02:56:47.724]  We're going to find out if we can make the police do their job.
[02:56:47.744 --> 02:56:49.947]  Because police in most areas aren't looking for trouble.
[02:56:49.967 --> 02:56:50.988]  They're not looking to be whatever.
[02:56:51.508 --> 02:56:52.329]  And they do their job.
[02:56:52.349 --> 02:56:55.774]  But these blue cities, more and more, that came out in documents, they're standing down.
[02:56:55.834 --> 02:56:56.134]  Briefly.
[02:56:59.090 --> 02:57:03.975]  And they've got George Soros and the Democrats funding lawsuits against us, and we've gotten 10 of 20 of them thrown out.
[02:57:04.375 --> 02:57:05.536]  The others, we're having to fight.
[02:57:06.257 --> 02:57:11.902]  And, you know, thank God we made provision and saved up some money over the years, you know, for backup.
[02:57:11.942 --> 02:57:15.666]  But we burned through a lot of that backup money, and we're getting on the reserve tank here.
[02:57:15.906 --> 02:57:18.508]  And I've got to tell you right now, we need major financial support.

[02:58:02.552 --> 02:58:10.194]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:58:10.434 --> 02:58:13.575]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:58:13.775 --> 02:58:18.862]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:58:19.042 --> 02:58:21.586]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:58:21.826 --> 02:58:30.839]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:58:30.959 --> 02:58:42.588]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pal Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:58:42.828 --> 02:58:47.531]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:47.632 --> 02:58:49.293]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:57.372 --> 02:59:00.473]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:59:00.493 --> 02:59:01.014]  You're on the air.
[02:59:01.034 --> 02:59:01.574]  Thanks for holding.
[02:59:01.994 --> 02:59:03.055]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:59:03.295 --> 02:59:03.875]  Hey, brother.
[02:59:04.195 --> 02:59:04.555]  Good, man.
[02:59:04.575 --> 02:59:05.376]  Thank you for calling.
[02:59:05.476 --> 02:59:06.016]  Hey, hey.
[02:59:06.116 --> 02:59:10.318]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:59:10.398 --> 02:59:17.101]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:59:17.121 --> 02:59:18.942]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:59:19.022 --> 02:59:25.805]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:59:26.325 --> 02:59:27.446]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:59:27.506 --> 02:59:31.528]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:59:31.908 --> 02:59:33.589]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:59:33.969 --> 02:59:34.710]  And exactly.
[02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:38.972]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:59:39.312 --> 02:59:39.592]  Boom!
[02:59:39.732 --> 02:59:42.554]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:59:42.614 --> 02:59:43.154]  It's amazing.
[02:59:43.214 --> 02:59:47.437]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:59:54.440 --> 02:59:58.552]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.074 --> 03:00:00.358]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:09.700 --> 03:00:14.682]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:15.003 --> 03:00:17.364]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.024 --> 03:00:24.547]  Alright, Mike Adams is going to be in studio hosting the fourth hour today in the War Room with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone's coming up.
[03:00:25.507 --> 03:00:28.449]  There is just so much insanity going on, taking place right now.
[03:00:31.819 --> 03:00:40.765]  Just to watch the left, the Democrats, the globalists, looking at the demographics of the world and then trying to bring in third world populations and indoctrinate them in classical racism.
[03:00:40.785 --> 03:00:46.109]  I don't know if you saw this, Will Johnson, because usually I ignore this stuff because I get really sick of it.
[03:00:46.189 --> 03:00:47.350]  I mean, it hurts my soul.
[03:00:47.370 --> 03:00:49.231]  And it's not like I'm some perfect guy.
[03:00:49.751 --> 03:00:55.655]  But when you choose humanity, choose Jesus, when everybody come together, you don't want to abort black babies, white babies, any babies.
[03:00:56.556 --> 03:00:59.037]  But then you also see people turn into racist enemies against you.
[03:00:59.818 --> 03:01:01.039]  And because you're white,
[03:01:01.839 --> 03:01:04.061]  And then you see how they're funding the white supremacists.
[03:01:04.081 --> 03:01:07.123]  You see the whole dialectic of how they're playing us off.
[03:01:07.163 --> 03:01:12.767]  But then you've got this lady that heads up the New York Times now, on the board of directors, who literally says, exterminate whites.
[03:01:13.167 --> 03:01:14.468]  They're idiots.
[03:01:14.508 --> 03:01:15.128]  They're scum.
[03:01:15.208 --> 03:01:15.688]  I hate them.
[03:01:16.049 --> 03:01:16.769]  They're trash.
[03:01:17.770 --> 03:01:18.770]  White men are the enemy.
[03:01:18.791 --> 03:01:24.394]  And you can just see, and the New York Times is on Infowars.com, defending her, saying, well yeah.
[03:01:24.935 --> 03:01:26.776]  So they're setting up this thing where
[03:01:28.336 --> 03:01:30.097]  Like the KKK are a bunch of losers.
[03:01:30.117 --> 03:01:31.078]  No one even listens to them.
[03:01:31.098 --> 03:01:34.061]  But with the New York Times and everything, you get around these leftists.
[03:01:34.101 --> 03:01:35.942]  These are frothing racists.
[03:01:36.022 --> 03:01:40.926]  And I don't... I don't... They're crazy people.
[03:01:41.006 --> 03:01:46.131]  I don't even know what they're... Because I get their method, like using race, they can control people.
[03:01:46.191 --> 03:01:52.756]  But how are they going to normalize and say anybody that's a capitalist is a racist, with no evidence, but then they're all racist.
[03:01:52.836 --> 03:01:53.457]  It's just crazy.
[03:01:54.625 --> 03:01:55.365]  Yeah, you know what?
[03:01:55.645 --> 03:02:00.947]  I've been saying it for a while that there is a war on white people in this country.
[03:02:01.648 --> 03:02:08.550]  They are trying to make it to where white people will be out in the street and they will get hosed down with water hose and get dogs sticked onto them.
[03:02:09.211 --> 03:02:10.651]  They are trying to reverse it.
[03:02:11.091 --> 03:02:16.994]  I've had liberals, black liberals, say that white people, it's their turn to go through what black people went through.
[03:02:17.434 --> 03:02:22.636]  What's really crazy about all that, these black people that are telling me this never went through that themselves.
[03:02:23.354 --> 03:02:27.658]  They have been taught by the left to hate and demonize white people.
[03:02:28.118 --> 03:02:29.099]  That's it right there.
[03:02:29.339 --> 03:02:31.141]  In a nutshell, they constantly do it.
[03:02:31.161 --> 03:02:33.623]  They're constantly being taught that.
[03:02:34.183 --> 03:02:34.704]  And I agree.
[03:02:34.724 --> 03:02:45.613]  So what would Martin Luther King, who got killed for what he believed, what would he think if he woke up from a trance or asleep like Rip Van Winkle and like suddenly the left is like the KKK?
[03:02:45.793 --> 03:02:47.775]  But I guess he'd get it because he was a Republican.
[03:02:50.117 --> 03:02:51.498]  He did not envision this.
[03:02:52.742 --> 03:02:59.506]  It only took Obama 2,922 days to pretty much reverse everything Martin Luther King did.
[03:03:00.227 --> 03:03:00.647]  That's all.
[03:03:01.508 --> 03:03:03.309]  What he did reverse everything.
[03:03:03.329 --> 03:03:06.591]  We didn't have all this racial tension when Bush was in office.
[03:03:06.851 --> 03:03:08.572]  It only took place when Obama came.
[03:03:09.261 --> 03:03:13.542]  Martin Luther King said, this is not what I was talking about us being free.
[03:03:13.962 --> 03:03:16.623]  Now you have black people want to go back into slavery.
[03:03:16.843 --> 03:03:25.326]  A lot of times when I go to different rallies and I have these black people and they're approaching me telling me that white people want to do this to them or white people want to enslave them.
[03:03:25.646 --> 03:03:30.167]  I asked him, I said, you know, those shackles that you have on your hands and feet, they don't have any locks.
[03:03:30.948 --> 03:03:31.949]  You can take them off.
[03:03:32.249 --> 03:03:35.531]  And then when you go to take them off them, they get upset with you.
[03:03:35.551 --> 03:03:36.251]  They get angry.
[03:03:36.511 --> 03:03:38.492]  And then they'll put the shackles back on.
[03:03:38.933 --> 03:03:40.133]  And then they're looking for the locks.
[03:03:40.694 --> 03:03:43.195]  I don't understand the insanity of these people.
[03:03:43.215 --> 03:03:46.157]  Well, let me just say, the average white person is like anybody else.
[03:03:46.737 --> 03:03:49.459]  They're just watching TV, brainwashed, and hating themselves.
[03:03:49.499 --> 03:03:58.144]  I mean, the idea that white people are in some... Then the left puts chips on everybody's shoulders, and everybody's actually nervous around people, and then it gets even weirder.
[03:03:58.384 --> 03:04:00.525]  They know exactly what they're doing, but I think they're losing.
[03:04:01.576 --> 03:04:01.996]  Exactly.
[03:04:02.036 --> 03:04:05.259]  They even have white people coming out demonizing white people.
[03:04:05.339 --> 03:04:06.620]  That's the white liberal for you.
[03:04:07.081 --> 03:04:08.161]  That doesn't make any sense.
[03:04:08.281 --> 03:04:13.205]  I couldn't believe that I actually heard another white people talking about, yes, white people are the problem.
[03:04:13.526 --> 03:04:15.948]  We need to remove white people from society.
[03:04:16.268 --> 03:04:18.129]  White people have held down black people.
[03:04:18.189 --> 03:04:20.591]  White people have held down brown people.
[03:04:21.072 --> 03:04:23.734]  All along, it's yourself that holds yourself back.
[03:04:24.194 --> 03:04:25.395]  You can't blame it on anybody.
[03:04:25.475 --> 03:04:26.937]  I can't blame it on anybody.
[03:04:27.277 --> 03:04:31.000]  I have to blame Will Johnson for my failures, not anybody else.
[03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:32.761]  Well, definitely in this day and age.
[03:04:32.921 --> 03:04:34.782]  And people want to network and work together.
[03:04:35.002 --> 03:04:40.646]  They're always going to be racist on any side, but over there, there's all other societies of people that just want to live.
[03:04:41.226 --> 03:04:42.206]  And so you kind of opt in.
[03:04:42.247 --> 03:04:45.268]  Are you going to be a racist like the left, and everything's racial?
[03:04:45.308 --> 03:04:48.590]  Or you should be human, and then it's like, oh, we're all friends, let's all work together.
[03:04:48.890 --> 03:04:49.531]  And everything works.
[03:04:49.691 --> 03:04:55.534]  You know, if Satan went to the DNC to talk about his policies, which policies would the Democrats disagree with?
[03:04:56.295 --> 03:04:56.735]  None of them.
[03:04:56.855 --> 03:04:58.056]  They would agree with every single one.
[03:04:58.806 --> 03:04:59.246]  Well said.
[03:04:59.286 --> 03:05:00.707]  You're going to pop in with us again tomorrow.
[03:05:00.747 --> 03:05:01.268]  God bless you.
[03:05:01.628 --> 03:05:02.509]  Great job in Portland.
[03:05:21.361 --> 03:05:28.785]  Very cool logo and kind of more discreet so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[03:05:29.065 --> 03:05:31.927]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:05:51.595 --> 03:05:52.175]  No reviews yet.
[03:05:52.195 --> 03:05:52.855]  We just launched today.
[03:05:52.875 --> 03:05:55.416]  And then we have, we have Mean Like a Wolverine.
[03:05:55.436 --> 03:05:57.676]  It's not the Marvel comic, Wimpy Wolverine.
[03:05:57.716 --> 03:05:58.797]  It's the Trump Wolverine.
[03:05:59.077 --> 03:06:00.997]  That's available at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:06:01.197 --> 03:06:03.178]  Be sure and get those and fund the operation.
[03:06:11.607 --> 03:06:19.094]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[03:06:19.595 --> 03:06:32.667]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[03:06:34.148 --> 03:06:37.535]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space.
[03:06:37.955 --> 03:06:42.083]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[03:06:42.304 --> 03:06:46.311]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[03:06:47.079 --> 03:07:03.184]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[03:07:03.384 --> 03:07:04.105]  InfoWars.
[03:07:04.485 --> 03:07:05.365]  Tomorrow's news.
[03:07:05.665 --> 03:07:06.065]  Today.
[03:07:06.085 --> 03:07:10.687]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:07:12.284 --> 03:07:14.365]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:07:14.645 --> 03:07:15.745]  I believe in you!
[03:07:16.145 --> 03:07:17.286]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:07:19.946 --> 03:07:21.947]  One man ever raped a woman!
[03:07:22.247 --> 03:07:23.868]  All genitals were cut off!
[03:07:24.108 --> 03:07:26.548]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:07:26.668 --> 03:07:27.889]  And we're not backing down, ever!
[03:07:29.169 --> 03:07:30.950]  I wanna get these people!
[03:07:31.010 --> 03:07:31.510]  We're winning!
[03:07:31.570 --> 03:07:32.670]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:07:32.830 --> 03:07:33.290]  Can't you?
[03:07:33.571 --> 03:07:35.191]  We have broken their back!
[03:07:35.571 --> 03:07:36.732]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:07:40.593 --> 03:07:41.093]  Let's go!
[03:07:42.523 --> 03:07:42.683]  Come on!
[03:07:42.743 --> 03:07:43.083]  Come on!
[03:07:43.123 --> 03:07:43.404]  Come on!
[03:07:43.424 --> 03:07:43.644]  Come on!
[03:07:43.724 --> 03:07:43.944]  Come on!
[03:07:43.984 --> 03:07:44.264]  Come on!
[03:07:44.384 --> 03:07:44.585]  Come on!
[03:07:44.605 --> 03:07:44.905]  Come on!
[03:07:45.005 --> 03:07:45.225]  Come on!
[03:07:45.265 --> 03:07:45.605]  Come on!
[03:07:45.645 --> 03:07:45.966]  Come on!
[03:07:46.006 --> 03:07:46.226]  Come on!
[03:07:46.246 --> 03:07:46.526]  Come on!
[03:07:46.546 --> 03:07:46.866]  Come on!
[03:07:46.906 --> 03:07:47.127]  Come on!
[03:07:47.147 --> 03:07:47.427]  Come on!
[03:07:47.527 --> 03:07:47.687]  Come on!
[03:07:47.707 --> 03:07:47.907]  Come on!
[03:07:47.947 --> 03:07:48.087]  Come on!
[03:07:48.107 --> 03:07:48.247]  Come on!
[03:07:48.267 --> 03:07:48.408]  Come on!

[03:08:03.039 --> 03:08:03.319]  Come on
[03:08:06.531 --> 03:08:11.313]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[03:08:11.693 --> 03:08:24.818]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state
[03:08:24.878 --> 03:08:25.719]  We're good to go.
[03:08:45.613 --> 03:08:49.216]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[03:08:49.776 --> 03:09:01.264]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[03:09:02.404 --> 03:09:11.290]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[03:09:11.871 --> 03:09:13.152]  Demand truth.
[03:09:13.192 --> 03:09:14.813]  Demand InfoWars.
[03:09:18.915 --> 03:09:25.559]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones during the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show broadcast.
[03:09:25.599 --> 03:09:27.500]  Thank you for staying with us today.
[03:09:27.540 --> 03:09:33.023]  I've got quite a powerful roundup of information for you today because it has become apparent to me
[03:09:33.743 --> 03:09:37.604]  That censorship is the civil rights issue of our time.
[03:09:38.105 --> 03:09:43.767]  That's why I was so happy to see the guest that Alex just had on, who also invoked that same comparison.
[03:09:44.207 --> 03:09:46.128]  This is a civil rights issue.
[03:09:46.508 --> 03:09:50.029]  Do we have the right to participate in a civil society?
[03:09:50.549 --> 03:09:51.730]  Do we have the right to speak?
[03:09:51.790 --> 03:09:56.992]  Do we have the right even to defend ourselves against slander and smears?
[03:09:57.012 --> 03:10:01.513]  And no one today is more smeared than Alex Jones is right now.
[03:10:01.593 --> 03:10:02.714]  He is at the top of the list.
[03:10:03.374 --> 03:10:10.257]  And what's so malicious about it is that they know they are smearing Alex deliberately with false information.
[03:10:10.317 --> 03:10:11.257]  They know it's false.
[03:10:11.657 --> 03:10:13.698]  They don't even attempt to tell the truth.
[03:10:14.078 --> 03:10:18.940]  They are trying to smear Alex with fake, made-up lies.
[03:10:19.660 --> 03:10:33.872]  And I see that as someone who is, you know, I'm not an employee of InfoWars, I'm not part of the InfoWars organization, I come in and I contribute, but I've got my own organization, so I'm able to kind of see this as a third-party perspective.
[03:10:34.453 --> 03:10:41.318]  And what I see them doing to Alex Jones is unbelievably, it is malicious, it's beyond
[03:10:42.666 --> 03:10:43.246]  I think?
[03:11:03.362 --> 03:11:04.843]  Talk about basic facts.
[03:11:05.183 --> 03:11:08.824]  And if they accuse Alex of something, why don't they show the video?
[03:11:08.944 --> 03:11:10.625]  Why don't they play the audio?
[03:11:10.985 --> 03:11:14.667]  They say Alex Jones attacked some little kid.
[03:11:15.007 --> 03:11:15.887]  Where's the video of it?
[03:11:16.207 --> 03:11:17.468]  It doesn't exist.
[03:11:17.848 --> 03:11:18.908]  So they have to make it up.
[03:11:18.968 --> 03:11:20.189]  They have to fake it.
[03:11:20.489 --> 03:11:22.610]  And that's what's so malicious about this.
[03:11:23.910 --> 03:11:29.593]  What else is interesting is that in their effort to destroy Alex Jones, the left-wing media is committing suicide.
[03:11:30.376 --> 03:11:33.818]  They are destroying their reputation forever.
[03:11:34.539 --> 03:11:40.683]  Because I don't know about you, but for me, I will never trust anything ever again that CNN says.
[03:11:41.124 --> 03:11:45.326]  I will never trust a single article in the New York Times or the fake news Washington Post.
[03:11:45.727 --> 03:11:50.290]  I know that they are not just accidentally fake, but maliciously, deliberately fake.
[03:11:50.590 --> 03:11:56.754]  And so I know that whatever they print about Alex Jones, or President Trump, or even what they print about me, I know it's false.
[03:11:57.175 --> 03:11:58.416]  I know it firsthand.
[03:11:59.056 --> 03:12:00.277]  Because I'm here.
[03:12:00.297 --> 03:12:02.258]  I talk to Alex.
[03:12:02.319 --> 03:12:03.019]  I see these things.
[03:12:03.059 --> 03:12:05.701]  I also see the lies they write about me or President Trump.
[03:12:06.141 --> 03:12:06.602]  So I see it.
[03:12:07.659 --> 03:12:13.583]  But I want to plug this book today, not being paid to plug it, it's called The Russia Hoax, right here, Greg Jarrett.
[03:12:13.984 --> 03:12:15.805]  This is a must-read book.
[03:12:16.385 --> 03:12:19.628]  It is already flying off the shelves at bookstores all across America.
[03:12:20.008 --> 03:12:25.172]  The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.
[03:12:25.692 --> 03:12:30.255]  Now, I'm about a third of the way into this book already, and it is mind-blowing.
[03:12:30.335 --> 03:12:31.917]  Greg Jarrett lays out
[03:12:32.617 --> 03:12:47.058]  The case of collusion, corruption, their false framing of President Trump, how they are falsely accusing him, trying to destroy his presidency by accusing him of crimes that they made up.
[03:12:47.739 --> 03:12:55.746]  And they're doing it, most importantly, this is what Jarrett reveals in the book, they're doing it in order to clear Hillary Clinton of the actual crimes that she committed.
[03:12:56.767 --> 03:13:09.237]  And I think that it is up to us to not just support InfoWars, support InfoWars Store, you know, purchase the health enhancing products, but also let's support authors who are doing this kind of good work.
[03:13:09.738 --> 03:13:10.858]  We need to support Greg Jarrett.
[03:13:11.619 --> 03:13:14.103]  We need to support Tucker Carlson.
[03:13:14.603 --> 03:13:26.640]  We need to support even people like Sean Hannity, people who are out there who are defending or attempting to defend this nation against the lies and smears that are happening everywhere, even now inside Fox News.
[03:13:27.381 --> 03:13:39.865]  And I'm sure that even Greg Jarrett looks at what's happening in Fox News and he's disgusted by it, as is Judge Napolitano, who used to have a show there, but he was canned because he told too much truth as well.
[03:13:40.065 --> 03:13:41.646]  There's a civil war inside Fox News.
[03:13:42.006 --> 03:13:54.830]  But we have to support those inside those organizations, like Fox News, who are telling the truth and who are willing to document the lies and write books and go on camera and tell the truth each and every day in America.
[03:13:55.831 --> 03:14:00.615]  So it's not just about supporting Alex Jones and InfoWars, it's also about supporting people like Greg Jarrett.
[03:14:00.655 --> 03:14:04.298]  And I gotta say, Greg, outstanding job as an author myself.
[03:14:05.459 --> 03:14:07.301]  I recognize the amount of work that went into this.
[03:14:07.501 --> 03:14:10.123]  It is probably, you know, a couple thousand hours of work.
[03:14:10.183 --> 03:14:11.004]  It's an extraordinary book.
[03:14:11.044 --> 03:14:13.686]  I can't recommend it highly enough.
[03:14:14.107 --> 03:14:20.992]  Now, coming up in the rest of the show today, as we continue the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, I'm going to talk about
[03:14:21.933 --> 03:14:22.674]  3D printed guns.
[03:14:22.694 --> 03:14:29.720]  I'm going to tell you some hard truth about that and why the left-wing media is lying about 3D printing of guns.
[03:14:29.740 --> 03:14:33.063]  I'm going to comment on that New York Times editorial board member.
[03:14:33.083 --> 03:14:41.791]  I'm going to read you a plea from Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit who says, get ready and pray to God because it's all coming down.
[03:14:41.831 --> 03:14:46.335]  The final act in the coup d'etat has begun.
[03:14:47.728 --> 03:14:49.670]  I'm gonna read some headlines from a story.
[03:14:49.710 --> 03:14:51.993]  We are the last line of defense against global government.
[03:14:52.333 --> 03:14:58.981]  And also, I'm gonna play for you, actually I'm gonna perform it for you, a dramatization.
[03:15:00.122 --> 03:15:01.043]  A dramatization
[03:15:02.228 --> 03:15:08.072]  Of Twitter engaging in a different kind of censorship than what they're doing right now.
[03:15:08.152 --> 03:15:12.435]  That Twitter dramatization is a fictional segment.
[03:15:12.455 --> 03:15:25.204]  It will be marked as a dramatization, but it will be mind-blowing, absolutely shocking, and it will be stated in the spirit of liberty and freedom and the First Amendment rights and protections for us all.
[03:15:25.244 --> 03:15:29.327]  That is all coming up on the Alex Jones Show here today.
[03:15:29.407 --> 03:15:30.288]  Also, finally, I'm going to
[03:15:31.237 --> 03:15:40.582]  I'm going to tell you something about Alex Jones that people seem to have forgotten the gift that he has given our world in terms of what he actually stands for.
[03:15:41.723 --> 03:15:43.424]  Forget the lies from the media for a moment.
[03:15:43.444 --> 03:15:45.725]  Let's talk about what Alex Jones really stands for.
[03:15:45.745 --> 03:15:51.849]  I'm going to bring you that summary as a third-party independent person when we continue here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:52.670]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:15:52.710 --> 03:15:53.190]  Stay with us.
[03:16:02.754 --> 03:16:13.362]  Not only is the president looking to take away Brennan's security clearance, he's also looking into the clearances of Comey, Clapper, Hayden, Rice, and McCabe.
[03:16:13.702 --> 03:16:26.672]  The president is exploring the mechanisms to remove security clearance because they've politicized and in some cases monetized their public service and security clearances, making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia,
[03:16:27.092 --> 03:16:30.095]  President Trump's response to the corrupt globalist deep state is equivalent to what they're doing.
[03:16:47.091 --> 03:16:48.392]  They're calling him a traitor.
[03:16:48.412 --> 03:16:54.358]  They're saying remove him from office for meeting with Vladimir Putin publicly when Hillary met with him illegally and secretly.
[03:16:55.039 --> 03:16:57.842]  They're saying he needs to be overthrown all over the news.
[03:16:57.882 --> 03:17:03.167]  They're circulating it in government publications and white papers that are public.
[03:17:04.048 --> 03:17:07.431]  And then Trump comes out and says, we'll pull your security clearances.
[03:17:08.212 --> 03:17:08.892]  John Brennan.
[03:17:09.793 --> 03:17:11.514]  Clapper and others.
[03:17:12.375 --> 03:17:14.036]  Because you can't be trusted.
[03:17:14.116 --> 03:17:15.277]  You're anti-American.
[03:17:15.317 --> 03:17:20.221]  You're totally partisan, working against the election of our last president.
[03:17:21.182 --> 03:17:23.224]  You are working as seditious operatives.
[03:17:23.784 --> 03:17:33.912]  And if you look at people like John Brennan, in college and then out of college, he was in the Communist Party, voted for the Communist Party, and bragged about it to the New Yorker magazine and other publications.
[03:17:34.172 --> 03:17:35.633]  But Snopes says it's not true.
[03:17:36.034 --> 03:17:37.475]  Go look it up for yourself.
[03:17:38.395 --> 03:17:42.196]  Then Brennan joined the most radical form of Islam, a Wahhabist.
[03:17:42.336 --> 03:17:44.517]  Of course Obama put this radical in.
[03:17:45.117 --> 03:17:52.079]  And it was Brennan, and it was Clapper, and it was Rice and others who illegally spied on Trump from 2015 on.
[03:17:52.459 --> 03:18:00.361]  It's all come out now that they were illegally spying without warrants and then they did the famous system of parallel construction.
[03:18:01.401 --> 03:18:11.134]  To go back and get warrants on false info, and now their whole criminal cabal that makes Richard Nixon look like a choir boy is all starting to calm down.
[03:18:11.154 --> 03:18:13.217]  And that's why they're at their most dangerous point right now.
[03:18:13.497 --> 03:18:16.120]  And they're saying, how dare you say you'll pull our security clearances?
[03:18:16.301 --> 03:18:17.622]  Oh, by the way, we don't need them.
[03:18:18.263 --> 03:18:27.271]  Oh, they need them so that moles in the government that are still there can give them classified info, which they can then parlay and sell with these lucrative jobs they've got.
[03:18:27.551 --> 03:18:36.218]  And then they can spin the info, leak the president's agenda, spin it, and then derail it and sabotage it, like the Korean peace deal and so many other issues.
[03:18:36.258 --> 03:18:38.220]  They're openly rooting to crash the economy.
[03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:41.341]  On Bill Maher's show and others, they are the enemies.
[03:18:41.702 --> 03:18:42.562]  They hate America.
[03:18:42.942 --> 03:18:46.965]  They're the coastal elites that absolutely hate the people on the East and West Coast as well.
[03:18:47.365 --> 03:18:48.426]  They are the traitors.
[03:18:48.486 --> 03:18:49.226]  They are the plague.
[03:18:49.546 --> 03:18:55.129]  And finally, Trump is awake and taking action and getting aggressive and pointing out these people cannot be trusted.
[03:18:55.189 --> 03:19:03.014]  It is the standard first move you make to cut off the deep state that is working for multinational corporations, the Communist Chinese and others.
[03:19:03.434 --> 03:19:04.195]  They are the enemy.
[03:19:04.315 --> 03:19:07.098]  They have stood in the way of American prosperity and peace and security.
[03:19:07.298 --> 03:19:09.541]  And now they're in deep trouble and they know it.
[03:19:09.601 --> 03:19:11.983]  So I salute President Trump for what he's done.
[03:19:12.003 --> 03:19:16.007]  I want to just remind the listeners that you heard all of this a year and a half ago.
[03:19:16.308 --> 03:19:18.190]  Hear first about the illegal FISA warrants.
[03:19:18.690 --> 03:19:19.951]  Uh, about the deep state spying.
[03:19:20.311 --> 03:19:27.074]  We got demonized because we have the sources, we have the research, we have the understanding of the globalist model, and we know how to defeat it.
[03:19:27.114 --> 03:19:34.078]  So whatever you do, spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com today and realize we're under attack because we know what we're talking about.
[03:19:34.378 --> 03:19:46.304]  And if you want to find out what's going to happen next week, next month, next year, just like we told you in the past and we're right, then tune in today and spread the word because it's you out there that helps us get around the electronic Berlin Wall of shadow banning and all the rest of it.
[03:19:46.324 --> 03:19:47.725]  And because of you, we're winning.
[03:19:48.085 --> 03:19:54.728]  And whatever you do, download the new free official InfoWars app at InfoWars.com forward slash app and tell everybody you know to download it as well.
[03:19:54.868 --> 03:20:02.032]  It's the best way to get new people to tune into the show and find out what's so verboten, what's so forbidden that the whole deep state hates us.
[03:20:06.096 --> 03:20:10.699]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.506 --> 03:20:28.228]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:20:28.588 --> 03:20:32.771]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:36.192 --> 03:20:45.960]  One of the wonderful things about coming here to the InfoWars studios and filling in from time to time and having my own show, CounterThink, on Sundays, it airs at 6 p.m.
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:21:03.074]  on InfoWars.com, is knowing that this organization, I walk around, I look at all the different people here, people of different ethnic backgrounds, people of different skin color, not that that matters, but there's a lot of diversity in this office, people of different ideas, people of different religious backgrounds,
[03:21:03.975 --> 03:21:06.317]  And perhaps people of different sexual orientations.
[03:21:06.357 --> 03:21:06.657]  I don't know.
[03:21:06.697 --> 03:21:07.218]  I don't ask.
[03:21:07.538 --> 03:21:08.699]  So it's none of my business.
[03:21:09.479 --> 03:21:19.687]  But the thing is that Alex Jones and InfoWars is the true definition of diversity of ideas and tolerance of individual liberty.
[03:21:20.647 --> 03:21:22.369]  Because here at InfoWars
[03:21:23.362 --> 03:21:31.728]  And I'm not putting words in Alex's mouth, but I know that he welcomes people of all kinds of backgrounds as long as they are pro-liberty.
[03:21:32.248 --> 03:21:32.889]  That's the key.
[03:21:33.449 --> 03:21:38.373]  Alex doesn't judge you by your skin color, your sexual orientation, your religion, or lack of religion.
[03:21:39.093 --> 03:21:40.094]  The country of origin?
[03:21:40.114 --> 03:21:41.515]  None of that stuff.
[03:21:41.635 --> 03:21:42.715]  Not by how you look or anything.
[03:21:43.296 --> 03:21:47.898]  Alex judges you the way I do, which is to say, are you pro-liberty?
[03:21:47.938 --> 03:21:49.900]  Do you support individual liberty?
[03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:53.302]  Are you rooted in logic and reason and rationality?
[03:21:53.922 --> 03:21:55.043]  These are the things that matter.
[03:21:55.163 --> 03:21:59.025]  These are the things, by the way, that people like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:21:59.125 --> 03:22:03.828]  called for when he said, you know, we should judge people by the content of their character, right?
[03:22:03.868 --> 03:22:04.989]  Not the color of their skin.
[03:22:06.150 --> 03:22:06.930]  Don't be skin deep.
[03:22:07.051 --> 03:22:08.072]  Look into the soul.
[03:22:08.132 --> 03:22:09.313]  Look into the spirit of people.
[03:22:09.974 --> 03:22:12.957]  And frankly, that is the spirit that I see here at InfoWars.
[03:22:13.017 --> 03:22:19.764]  It's not like I can take a camera and walk around and show you everybody because a lot of people, you know, they want to be private, understandably.
[03:22:20.484 --> 03:22:25.429]  But it's a very fascinating workplace and it's in that spirit now.
[03:22:26.536 --> 03:22:36.664]  I'm going to read you, this is a dramatization coming up of a fictional announcement about Twitter and CEO Jack Dorsey.
[03:22:37.225 --> 03:22:46.412]  Now, we're going to label this a dramatization when I begin so that there's no confusion, that this isn't fake news, this is a dramatization, a what-if scenario.
[03:22:47.153 --> 03:22:53.203]  And it asks the question, what if Twitter were censoring a different group other than just conservatives?
[03:22:53.243 --> 03:22:57.790]  Because today they censor conservatives and libertarians and they censor people for being Christians.
[03:22:59.076 --> 03:23:04.837]  And we're told by the left that, well that's okay, Twitter can censor anyone they want because they're a private company, they can do whatever they want.
[03:23:05.437 --> 03:23:21.081]  So I dare ask the question today, in the spirit of true diversity, of true openness to all races, colors, creeds, nationalities, religions, as long as you're pro-liberty, I ask the question, what would happen if Twitter did the following?
[03:23:21.521 --> 03:23:25.021]  So here we go, put up that dramatization graphic there.
[03:23:25.982 --> 03:23:27.322]  Here we go, this is a dramatization.
[03:23:29.497 --> 03:23:34.800]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced today that Twitter will ban the online speech of all black people.
[03:23:36.061 --> 03:23:40.364]  This, says Dorsey, is perfectly allowable because Twitter is a, quote, private company.
[03:23:41.004 --> 03:23:45.927]  And according to the current consensus on the left, private companies can, quote, ban anyone they like.
[03:23:46.528 --> 03:23:49.910]  As of today, according to Jack Dorsey, black people can no longer use Twitter.
[03:23:51.664 --> 03:23:55.147]  Black employees at Twitter are no longer allowed to eat at the company cafeteria.
[03:23:55.787 --> 03:23:59.810]  And anyone of dark skin color is being asked to sit in the back of Twitter's offices.
[03:24:00.691 --> 03:24:06.775]  Furthermore, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says that any tweets containing the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:24:07.116 --> 03:24:12.440]  will be deemed hate speech because such speeches demand people be judged based on merit.
[03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:21.782]  Rather than superficial qualities, and the left absolutely despises people being judged based on their earned merit rather than their unearned victim status.
[03:24:22.542 --> 03:24:25.283]  Meritocracy, says Jack Dorsey, is racism.
[03:24:26.043 --> 03:24:33.705]  We must protect Twitter users from the kind of meritocracy-based hate speech spoken by, yes, he said this, people like Dr. Martin Luther King.
[03:24:34.705 --> 03:24:38.926]  He went on to explain that, quote, their kind are not welcomed at Twitter.
[03:24:40.271 --> 03:24:49.197]  And that as a private company, Twitter has the right to discriminate against people for any reason at all, he says, because the First Amendment protects Twitter's right to selectively censor voices with whom they disagree.
[03:24:50.178 --> 03:24:54.821]  Black people, explained Dorsey, can simply use other platforms to express themselves.
[03:24:54.901 --> 03:24:58.063]  We don't have to allow their kind to use the Twitter platform.
[03:24:58.903 --> 03:25:00.765]  Alright, end dramatization.
[03:25:01.926 --> 03:25:16.815]  That was a fictional what-if, and I'm invoking this precisely to get you to ask the question, how big of a civil rights outcry, nationwide marches, screaming and rightful
[03:25:18.007 --> 03:25:19.228]  Attacks on Twitter.
[03:25:19.308 --> 03:25:30.417]  Would there be, if Jack Dorsey had done exactly what I just depicted in that dramatization, how big of an outcry would there be, and should there be, if he censored black people?
[03:25:30.537 --> 03:25:32.198]  Or if he censored gays?
[03:25:32.819 --> 03:25:34.360]  Or if he censored all women?
[03:25:34.860 --> 03:25:40.084]  What if Jack Dorsey said that women are not allowed to post on Twitter anymore for whatever reason he wanted to give?
[03:25:40.845 --> 03:25:47.268]  Would that be okay to the left because they say that, well, Twitter is a private corporation, they can censor whatever they want?
[03:25:47.828 --> 03:25:53.430]  What if Google blocked all searches of content authored by lesbians and gays?
[03:25:54.351 --> 03:26:00.293]  What if Facebook said that women shouldn't have the right to participate in public speech because there used to be a day when they couldn't vote?
[03:26:01.594 --> 03:26:03.855]  What if YouTube declared Christianity to be hate speech?
[03:26:04.955 --> 03:26:06.936]  Oh wait, they've already done that.
[03:26:08.772 --> 03:26:15.468]  This dramatization is designed to invoke discussion and debate on what I believe is the biggest civil rights issue of our time.
[03:26:16.089 --> 03:26:17.532]  And I offer this dramatization...
[03:26:18.570 --> 03:26:34.480]  In the spirit of knowing that we welcome African-Americans, gays and lesbians, we welcome people of any religious background, of any nationality, we welcome you to join the fight for liberty, for the First Amendment, and we support you.
[03:26:35.220 --> 03:26:37.562]  And we celebrate your efforts.
[03:26:38.442 --> 03:26:41.324]  While the left talks about diversity, they crush it.
[03:26:41.904 --> 03:26:47.088]  Look at this New York Times new editorial board member, I don't have her name in front of me, but
[03:26:48.163 --> 03:26:52.946]  She says that whites are horrible, evil people who need to live in caves.
[03:26:52.986 --> 03:26:53.587]  What did she say?
[03:26:53.627 --> 03:26:54.748]  That they need to be... Here it is.
[03:26:55.268 --> 03:26:59.831]  They're only fit to live underground like groveling goblins, she says.
[03:26:59.991 --> 03:27:01.312]  She's working for the New York Times.
[03:27:01.773 --> 03:27:03.414]  She despises white people.
[03:27:04.608 --> 03:27:10.915]  And it's New York Times and other mainstream media outlets that call Alex Jones, you know, racist or discriminatory.
[03:27:11.195 --> 03:27:18.363]  And Alex Jones supports people of every color, of every religion, of every background, as long as you support liberty, for God's sake.
[03:27:19.424 --> 03:27:22.287]  And that's what this Twitter dramatization is all about.
[03:27:22.368 --> 03:27:23.409]  I want to get this point across.
[03:27:24.631 --> 03:27:31.524]  We are here to fight for all of humanity regardless of what you look like, regardless of your skin color.
[03:27:32.005 --> 03:27:34.730]  We are here to fight for your right to speak and your right to exist.
[03:27:35.976 --> 03:27:36.256]  You're right.
[03:27:55.740 --> 03:27:58.643]  Claim that I was saying to ban black people.
[03:27:58.723 --> 03:28:04.568]  No, that's Jack Dorsey in that dramatization claiming that black people should be banned.
[03:28:04.588 --> 03:28:06.530]  I mean, imagine the outcry if that happened.
[03:28:07.010 --> 03:28:09.592]  That's the kind of outcry that we should be mounting, all of us, black
[03:28:10.458 --> 03:28:13.000]  White, Latino, Asian, all of us.
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:14.961]  We're all on Team Humanity here, okay?
[03:28:15.622 --> 03:28:16.962]  And I look around the Infowars office.
[03:28:17.023 --> 03:28:18.303]  It's Team Humanity everywhere.
[03:28:18.924 --> 03:28:34.514]  We are all fighting for the freedom of individuals to stand up and speak and to engage in debate and to even vote and have your vote count so that there's an election outcome that isn't overturned by a bunch of crooks like Robert Mueller outlined in this book, The Russia Hoax.
[03:28:34.534 --> 03:28:36.436]  You gotta read this book by Greg Jarrett.
[03:28:37.016 --> 03:28:37.637]  It nails it.
[03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:49.263]  Humanity is under attack, and it's InfoWars that is defending humanity against these assaults that are rooted in incredible evil, intolerance, and discrimination from every angle.
[03:28:49.804 --> 03:28:51.546]  You want the truth about defending humanity?

[03:30:06.188 --> 03:30:09.631]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.

[03:30:31.421 --> 03:30:36.043]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[03:30:36.103 --> 03:30:36.703]  Ah, you don't want that.

[03:32:10.026 --> 03:32:11.187]  Thanks for holding.
[03:32:11.227 --> 03:32:12.047]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:32:12.267 --> 03:32:12.887]  Hey, brother.
[03:32:13.168 --> 03:32:13.528]  Good, man.
[03:32:13.568 --> 03:32:14.368]  Thank you for calling.
[03:32:14.448 --> 03:32:15.008]  Hey, hey.
[03:32:15.108 --> 03:32:19.510]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:32:19.730 --> 03:32:26.093]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:32:26.233 --> 03:32:27.933]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[03:32:28.013 --> 03:32:34.796]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:32:35.436 --> 03:32:36.437]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:32:36.497 --> 03:32:38.958]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[03:32:38.998 --> 03:32:40.518]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:32:40.899 --> 03:32:42.499]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:32:42.959 --> 03:32:43.700]  And exactly.
[03:32:43.720 --> 03:32:47.982]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:32:48.302 --> 03:32:48.582]  Boom!
[03:32:48.722 --> 03:32:51.543]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:32:51.603 --> 03:32:52.144]  It's amazing.
[03:32:52.184 --> 03:32:53.504]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[03:32:53.564 --> 03:32:56.446]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:33:06.201 --> 03:33:08.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.891 --> 03:33:27.834]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:28.294 --> 03:33:30.575]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:34.409 --> 03:33:38.117]  Is the left-wing monopolist media the enemy of the people?
[03:33:38.778 --> 03:33:42.184]  That's the question of our day, and today Sarah Sanders...
[03:33:43.300 --> 03:33:52.163]  Refuses, this is a report from Mediaite, refuses to say that the press is not the enemy of the people in a, quote, jaw-dropping clash with Jim Acosta.
[03:33:52.183 --> 03:33:53.063]  Well, I agree.
[03:33:53.883 --> 03:33:56.044]  CNN is clearly the enemy of the people.
[03:33:56.244 --> 03:34:06.587]  CNN is complicit in whipping up the kind of hatred and derangement that has already led to over 500 violent attacks on Trump supporters across America, documented attacks.
[03:34:07.407 --> 03:34:09.648]  And is leading to a kind of civil war.
[03:34:09.688 --> 03:34:11.429]  I mean, did you see that video from yesterday?
[03:34:11.729 --> 03:34:20.754]  Some woman engaged in a Trump derangement vehicular assault on a guy because he had a Trump sticker on the back of his vehicle.
[03:34:20.794 --> 03:34:22.595]  Of course CNN is the enemy of the people.
[03:34:22.875 --> 03:34:23.535]  Let's not pretend.
[03:34:23.856 --> 03:34:25.196]  CNN doesn't represent America.
[03:34:25.817 --> 03:34:32.020]  CNN represents anti-American forces that want to see America overrun, overthrown, destroyed from within.
[03:34:33.268 --> 03:34:34.289]  They want to see a civil war.
[03:34:35.310 --> 03:34:38.753]  And that relates to this article from Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit today.
[03:34:38.773 --> 03:34:40.055]  I'm going to read some excerpts from this.
[03:34:40.075 --> 03:34:41.276]  This is huge.
[03:34:42.057 --> 03:34:44.239]  Get ready and pray to God, says Jim Hoft.
[03:34:45.340 --> 03:34:46.161]  The time is now.
[03:34:46.301 --> 03:34:50.205]  The imposters are preparing the final act in their coup d'etat.
[03:34:50.225 --> 03:34:52.527]  There's some highlights here that I've just got to share with you.
[03:34:53.148 --> 03:34:56.011]  To all TGP readers and all American patriots.
[03:34:57.478 --> 03:34:58.919]  This is written by Jim Hoft, okay?
[03:34:59.319 --> 03:35:01.160]  We are informing you to prepare yourselves.
[03:35:01.560 --> 03:35:03.121]  The country is at a precipice.
[03:35:03.341 --> 03:35:11.186]  America is either going to be overrun by a power-hungry deep state or it will survive one of the biggest attacks to its existence since the Civil War.
[03:35:11.966 --> 03:35:14.708]  We must be vigilant and prepared, he writes.
[03:35:15.588 --> 03:35:18.750]  The acts of the deep state are as appalling as they are criminal.
[03:35:20.106 --> 03:35:26.068]  An unelected and elected power-hungry minority is attempting a coup d'etat of the Trump administration.
[03:35:26.748 --> 03:35:36.672]  He writes, skipping on to kind of tighten this up here, he says, a small group of evil unelected officials, known as the Deep State, were given the reins of the U.S.
[03:35:36.712 --> 03:35:40.474]  justice system, State Department and intelligence agencies.
[03:35:41.214 --> 03:35:42.894]  We have now reached that moment.
[03:35:43.615 --> 03:35:49.617]  America will be free or it will become another failing exercise in the chronicles of human history.
[03:35:51.707 --> 03:36:00.730]  The hopes of the Deep State actors lie in winning the upcoming 2018 election so they can impeach a man for no other reason than he is not one of them.
[03:36:01.811 --> 03:36:05.692]  Perhaps no time since the Civil War has the country reached this pivotal point.
[03:36:06.672 --> 03:36:11.354]  The founders predicted a time like this, he writes, when they created the Second Amendment.
[03:36:12.194 --> 03:36:13.995]  Prepare yourselves and pray.
[03:36:14.975 --> 03:36:19.777]  Ask for another miracle to keep America the shining beacon on a hill.
[03:36:21.072 --> 03:36:31.769]  That's from Jim Hoft at the Gateway Pundit, and I would only add to that this appeal to President Trump and his advisors or staffers who might be watching.
[03:36:33.393 --> 03:36:57.458]  Whatever you have to do, President Trump, to expose this deep state and clean these swamp creatures out of Washington, whatever, if you need to declassify documents, if you need to fire Jeff Sessions, fire Rod Rosenstein, if you need to declassify multiple documents regarding the prosecution that should be taking place on Hillary Clinton, whatever you need to do, we have your back.
[03:36:58.438 --> 03:37:00.819]  And I'm not sure this has been stated so clearly, but
[03:37:01.809 --> 03:37:14.002]  I thought today as I was driving in that President Trump might be wondering how much do the American people have his back if he starts to declassify these documents and fire traitors and the Benedict Arnold of Jeff Sessions.
[03:37:14.883 --> 03:37:22.311]  He knows that there will be left-wing riots in 20-plus major cities all across America, that the left will go berserk.
[03:37:23.132 --> 03:37:24.913]  That they will go insane.
[03:37:24.953 --> 03:37:26.674]  They will set fire to buildings.
[03:37:26.714 --> 03:37:29.335]  They will commit atrocities of violence.
[03:37:29.355 --> 03:37:30.816]  They will attack Trump supporters.
[03:37:30.856 --> 03:37:36.478]  They will burn cars and buildings and maybe bomb government buildings as they've done in the past.
[03:37:37.659 --> 03:37:39.920]  There will be mass riots all over America.
[03:37:40.180 --> 03:37:42.241]  But I say, President Trump,
[03:37:42.941 --> 03:37:44.782]  And this is me, Mike Adams, speaking.
[03:37:45.343 --> 03:37:50.466]  I'm not speaking on behalf of InfoWars with this statement, or I can't even say Alex Jones' view on this.
[03:37:50.506 --> 03:37:51.987]  This is me as an independent citizen.
[03:37:52.007 --> 03:37:54.289]  I'm the author of the Adams Report that you've read.
[03:37:54.449 --> 03:38:03.355]  I say that we the people have your back, and we will meet those violent anti-American protesters block by block across America.
[03:38:03.715 --> 03:38:12.441]  And we will do so with every legal means, every constitutionally protected means that we have at our disposal to defend our president,
[03:38:13.181 --> 03:38:23.045]  To defend our nation, to defend our constitutional republic, and to defend our right to exist and to participate in a civil society.
[03:38:23.065 --> 03:38:32.829]  So President Trump, if you need to take drastic action to declassify materials so that we the people can see them, we need to see what's in that FISA warrant.
[03:38:33.129 --> 03:38:36.891]  We need to see how this leads back to former President Barack Obama.
[03:38:37.171 --> 03:38:38.772]  We need to see the complicity.
[03:38:39.850 --> 03:38:46.433]  Of Robert Mueller, James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, Loretta Lynch.
[03:38:46.453 --> 03:38:47.093]  It's a long list.
[03:38:47.493 --> 03:38:48.314]  We need to see that.
[03:38:48.374 --> 03:38:51.355]  The American people deserve to see it, and we will defend you.
[03:38:51.715 --> 03:38:53.296]  We will go to bat for you, President Trump.
[03:38:54.416 --> 03:38:57.898]  No matter what it takes, we are all in to defend this nation.
[03:38:57.918 --> 03:39:00.039]  Now, we will not instigate violence.
[03:39:00.099 --> 03:39:02.320]  We will not be aggressive in violence.
[03:39:02.620 --> 03:39:05.121]  We will be defensive, but we will be firm.
[03:39:06.681 --> 03:39:17.623]  And we will defend this nation with every legal means and every constitutionally protected means that we have available to us today, which of course includes, as Jim Hoff said, the Second Amendment.
[03:39:18.603 --> 03:39:25.265]  And we will do so in support of law and order, in support of law enforcement, in support of our Constitution.
[03:39:25.285 --> 03:39:29.745]  It's extraordinary what it has come to.
[03:39:33.206 --> 03:39:36.027]  I never imagined that I would even be here doing this, by the way.
[03:39:36.788 --> 03:39:39.569]  You might know me more as a food scientist, you know, the health ranger.
[03:39:40.149 --> 03:39:46.412]  I thought I was going to be in a lab working on pesticide quantitation analysis with mass spec equipment.
[03:39:46.652 --> 03:39:55.336]  I mean, my dream before all this censorship and all these attacks on our right to exist, my dream was to go to the grocery store, buy a thousand products,
[03:39:55.956 --> 03:40:03.518]  Test the pesticides, herbicides, and glyphosate in all those thousand products and publish those numbers publicly to help promote safe food.
[03:40:04.318 --> 03:40:05.078]  Clean food.
[03:40:05.419 --> 03:40:08.959]  Food that can support healthy children and healthy cognitive function.
[03:40:09.600 --> 03:40:10.760]  That was my goal.
[03:40:10.780 --> 03:40:11.620]  That's all I want to do.
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:15.121]  I just want to be in my lab testing food and helping people live healthy lives.
[03:40:15.481 --> 03:40:17.382]  And yet, here I am.
[03:40:18.522 --> 03:40:23.428]  And Alex, in a similar way, driven to this point where we have to become warriors.
[03:40:23.948 --> 03:40:29.995]  We have to become warriors because we are cornered into the point where they want to destroy us.
[03:40:30.055 --> 03:40:31.497]  They're trying to destroy our president.
[03:40:31.717 --> 03:40:33.099]  They're trying to destroy our society.
[03:40:33.399 --> 03:40:35.201]  And frankly, the lab test can wait.
[03:40:36.124 --> 03:41:01.863]  Because what good is it to have a laboratory if you're living in a society where we're all slaves to an authoritarian tyranny run by communist China that has infiltrated our universities and infiltrated Hollywood and infiltrated Congress, for that matter, where we're being overrun by violent, deranged, lunatic communists wearing black hoodies and black masks and committing mass violence against us?
[03:41:01.943 --> 03:41:04.465]  What good does it do to know whether your food is clean?
[03:41:04.505 --> 03:41:05.026]  You see what I mean?
[03:41:05.566 --> 03:41:10.167]  We've got to have priorities, and my priority right now is to be right here and to be fighting for this.
[03:41:11.648 --> 03:41:13.448]  I'm building alternative platforms.
[03:41:13.648 --> 03:41:14.689]  You know, Reel.Video.
[03:41:15.269 --> 03:41:16.569]  It's been live now for a month.
[03:41:17.249 --> 03:41:22.671]  InfoWars now has uploaded over 400 videos to that platform, Reel.Video.
[03:41:22.931 --> 03:41:23.711]  250 new channels a day.
[03:41:24.572 --> 03:41:30.353]  A million video minutes viewed in the last seven days on Reel.Video, and it's growing right now by about 10-15% per week.
[03:41:30.373 --> 03:41:30.693]  It is exploding.
[03:41:33.857 --> 03:41:35.479]  So this is the mission that I've had to do.
[03:41:35.539 --> 03:41:36.981]  We have to build alternative platforms.
[03:41:37.361 --> 03:41:41.025]  We have to write white papers, like the Adams Report.
[03:41:41.085 --> 03:41:42.587]  We have to fight for our freedom.
[03:41:43.496 --> 03:41:46.718]  We have to support InfoWars and InfoWars Store.
[03:41:47.839 --> 03:41:51.722]  You've got to support all of these efforts because now we are fighting for everything.
[03:41:52.262 --> 03:41:55.105]  As Jim Hoff said, get ready and pray to God.
[03:41:55.345 --> 03:41:56.145]  Those are his words.
[03:41:56.185 --> 03:41:57.146]  The time is now.
[03:41:57.586 --> 03:42:01.789]  The imposters are preparing the final act in their coup d'etat against America.
[03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:03.190]  He is absolutely right.
[03:42:04.171 --> 03:42:19.638]  And we see that happening, and that's why I'm here, and that's why you're listening, and that's why you support this broadcast, and that's why we all know that everything is at stake, and that's why we're willing to stand up and meet these anti-American forces block by block all across America to defend our president.
[03:42:19.938 --> 03:42:25.341]  So I say do not back down, do not instigate violence, but always seek to end it.
[03:42:26.161 --> 03:42:27.662]  Seek to end violence.
[03:42:27.982 --> 03:42:30.083]  Seek to restore law and order.
[03:42:30.343 --> 03:42:32.764]  Seek to restore civility in the streets of our country.
[03:42:33.224 --> 03:42:34.605]  Restore our Constitution.
[03:42:34.665 --> 03:42:36.086]  Restore our democracy.
[03:42:36.486 --> 03:42:38.567]  Because they are trying to steal these midterm elections.
[03:42:39.247 --> 03:42:44.150]  The tech giants are committing massive election fraud right now, every single day, online.
[03:42:44.950 --> 03:42:46.492]  It is a criminal racket.
[03:42:46.572 --> 03:42:48.675]  They should be prosecuted under the RICO Act.
[03:42:48.995 --> 03:42:50.757]  I'll talk about that more when we get back.
[03:42:51.438 --> 03:42:54.482]  One more segment still remaining here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:54.522 --> 03:42:55.783]  This is Mike Adams filling in.
[03:42:55.803 --> 03:42:56.264]  Stay with us.
[03:43:02.439 --> 03:43:06.282]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:06.583 --> 03:43:13.228]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:43:13.689 --> 03:43:18.252]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:43:18.533 --> 03:43:26.459]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide
[03:43:28.079 --> 03:43:41.103]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:43:41.543 --> 03:43:47.465]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water
[03:43:47.905 --> 03:43:48.686]  All over your home.
[03:43:49.046 --> 03:44:01.881]  Head to InfowarsStore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[03:44:03.098 --> 03:44:06.079]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force!
[03:44:06.159 --> 03:44:06.619]  Go ahead.
[03:44:06.859 --> 03:44:12.440]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[03:44:12.640 --> 03:44:13.740]  I'd done the War Room.
[03:44:14.040 --> 03:44:16.500]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[03:44:16.520 --> 03:44:18.081]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[03:44:18.121 --> 03:44:18.741]  I was exhausted.
[03:44:19.061 --> 03:44:22.321]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[03:44:22.681 --> 03:44:27.302]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[03:44:27.402 --> 03:44:29.423]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[03:44:29.583 --> 03:44:30.263]  Uh, same thing.
[03:44:30.343 --> 03:44:31.103]  I'm gonna put in a full
[03:44:31.383 --> 03:44:33.543]  Here at Infowars, I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[03:44:33.703 --> 03:44:35.824]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[03:44:35.844 --> 03:44:41.825]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[03:44:42.125 --> 03:44:42.925]  You can sleep with it.
[03:44:43.285 --> 03:44:47.586]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[03:44:47.646 --> 03:44:50.426]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[03:44:50.586 --> 03:44:52.307]  This is the best combination I have found.
[03:44:52.427 --> 03:44:53.107]  It really works.
[03:44:53.327 --> 03:44:57.948]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found, and I've tried them all.
[03:44:58.288 --> 03:45:00.428]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods, believe me.
[03:45:02.659 --> 03:45:08.082]  Two and a half years ago, Hillary Clinton dubbed myself and InfoWars as fake news.
[03:45:08.642 --> 03:45:20.909]  Since then, the Democrats in Congress, CNN, MSNBC, have all lobbied to keep me from publishing books, to have us kicked offline from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and they've had some success.
[03:45:21.489 --> 03:45:30.134]  Not only are they the real fake news, and working for the Communist Chinese and others to overthrow this country, they're also working to destroy the First Amendment here in America.
[03:45:30.774 --> 03:45:40.157]  But here at InfoWars, we've been expanding on radio and TV thanks to your support, and we've launched a new, powerful, free app called InfoWars Official.
[03:45:40.377 --> 03:45:49.559]  InfoWars Official is a state-of-the-art app with live streaming of podcasts, my broadcast, David Knight's show, The War Room with Rob
[03:45:49.619 --> 03:45:54.520]  Dr. Stone and Owen Schroyer and so many other broadcasts that we're launching as we speak.
[03:45:54.760 --> 03:45:57.200]  It's got live news feeds, live news alerts.
[03:45:57.440 --> 03:46:02.581]  It's got push notifications if you click to get them so you know we go live or have special events.
[03:46:02.741 --> 03:46:04.042]  This is the forbidden act.
[03:46:04.442 --> 03:46:05.682]  This is what they demonize.
[03:46:05.922 --> 03:46:07.522]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:46:07.962 --> 03:46:08.843]  Think for yourselves.
[03:46:08.903 --> 03:46:15.684]  Go find out why InfoWars is so verboten and why the system openly is lobbying to have us shut down.
[03:46:16.204 --> 03:46:22.926]  Every enemy of capitalism, every enemy of America, every globalist corporation hates InfoWars for one reason.
[03:46:23.666 --> 03:46:29.088]  We are aware of their operation and we are effective in challenging them and awakening our fellow humans.
[03:46:29.348 --> 03:46:32.309]  That's why every platform we've got is critical in the fight.
[03:46:32.529 --> 03:46:34.110]  And this new weapon is incredible.
[03:46:34.250 --> 03:46:38.773]  Whatever you do, ladies and gentlemen, go download the official InfoWars app today.
[03:46:39.133 --> 03:46:46.337]  And then, send out on your email, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, links to everybody saying, hey, here's the forbidden InfoWars platform.
[03:46:46.578 --> 03:46:48.299]  Here's what the globalists want shut down.
[03:46:48.539 --> 03:46:51.601]  Here's what they don't want you to hear, read, and see.
[03:46:51.981 --> 03:46:55.903]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalists at point-blank range.
[03:46:56.123 --> 03:47:00.166]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:47:06.128 --> 03:47:08.764]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:31.465 --> 03:47:33.847]  Mission impossible here at InfoWars.
[03:47:34.387 --> 03:47:38.270]  This is Mike Adams filling in for the fourth hour here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:38.290 --> 03:47:39.831]  Thank you for staying with us.
[03:47:39.851 --> 03:47:41.592]  You know, I put out an alert yesterday.
[03:47:42.773 --> 03:47:44.434]  I'm very, very concerned about this weekend.
[03:47:44.454 --> 03:47:54.482]  I see it as a perfect storm for a possible sort of a mishmash of attempted false flag attacks to blame conservative Americans.
[03:47:54.682 --> 03:47:56.083]  It's not a hundred percent prediction.
[03:47:56.223 --> 03:47:57.344]  You know, I don't have a crystal ball.
[03:47:57.904 --> 03:48:00.106]  I just see that things are lined up.
[03:48:00.347 --> 03:48:01.548]  The rhetoric is lining up.
[03:48:01.628 --> 03:48:03.150]  You've got the midterm elections coming up.
[03:48:03.230 --> 03:48:04.751]  They need another Charlottesville.
[03:48:04.791 --> 03:48:08.195]  They need, when I say they, I mean the anti-American globalists.
[03:48:08.235 --> 03:48:15.823]  They need to have somebody drive another car into a group of, frankly, left-wing people so that they can blame conservatives.
[03:48:16.484 --> 03:48:18.065]  I'm not predicting that that's what's going to happen.
[03:48:19.136 --> 03:48:19.697]  But it could.
[03:48:20.237 --> 03:48:27.262]  It's like this weekend seems to be just the mass hysteria of the left is peaking right now.
[03:48:27.302 --> 03:48:28.443]  I mean, maybe it'll go even higher.
[03:48:28.483 --> 03:48:28.844]  I don't know.
[03:48:29.524 --> 03:48:36.230]  Maybe if they get Judge Kavanaugh in on the Supreme Court, then heads will literally explode all across California.
[03:48:36.250 --> 03:48:36.750]  I'm not sure.
[03:48:37.330 --> 03:48:40.313]  But this weekend, I see the potential for violence.
[03:48:40.353 --> 03:48:41.354]  We hope it doesn't happen.
[03:48:42.034 --> 03:48:42.875]  We pray for your safety.
[03:48:42.895 --> 03:48:50.602]  I just want to tell you, if you're an InfoWars listener, do go out and be a peaceful part of these events.
[03:48:50.702 --> 03:48:51.843]  Support the Proud Boys.
[03:48:51.923 --> 03:48:53.585]  Support the peaceful prayer groups.
[03:48:53.665 --> 03:48:55.547]  Support pro-America groups.
[03:48:56.528 --> 03:49:05.857]  Do not initiate violence, but defend yourselves against the violence and aggression that is being used against you by radical left-wing Antifa groups and other similar groups.
[03:49:06.457 --> 03:49:12.862]  And I understand that Owen Schroyer and others from InfoWars are going to be on site in Portland, Oregon.
[03:49:13.903 --> 03:49:15.824]  We'll be documenting the situation there.
[03:49:15.864 --> 03:49:24.972]  So maybe just their presence with cameras will kind of tend to calm things down, because as we know about false flag events, they don't like false flags to be documented on video.
[03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:31.332]  So perhaps, if they had a plan, maybe they'll delay a plan, or maybe they'll do it in another city or another day.
[03:49:31.952 --> 03:49:33.132]  We hope nothing happens.
[03:49:33.172 --> 03:49:34.353]  We hope there's no violence.
[03:49:35.073 --> 03:49:37.635]  But we're also tired of being steamrolled in this country.
[03:49:37.655 --> 03:49:42.557]  We're going to stand up for our rights, our First Amendment, our Second Amendment, our President, our Republic.
[03:49:43.298 --> 03:49:50.221]  And I encourage you to join us in those peaceful protests all across America as we stand for our country.
[03:49:51.522 --> 03:49:53.983]  Let's talk about 3D-printed guns for a second here.
[03:49:55.509 --> 03:50:02.556]  So the left is going insane with, of course, the usual lies saying that, oh my god, people can print guns that are undetectable.
[03:50:03.156 --> 03:50:07.980]  So we have to have new laws that ban undetectable plastic guns printed on 3D printers.
[03:50:09.065 --> 03:50:15.531]  Okay, so it almost goes without saying, but anti-gun people are complete morons when it comes to guns.
[03:50:15.631 --> 03:50:17.873]  They have no idea how guns work.
[03:50:18.434 --> 03:50:21.176]  They also don't know anything about the laws or history.
[03:50:21.737 --> 03:50:26.561]  Because manufacturing an undetectable gun has been illegal in America since 1988.
[03:50:28.419 --> 03:50:32.944]  I think the name of it was the Undetectable Firearm Act or some similar version of that.
[03:50:32.964 --> 03:50:37.748]  It is illegal now to manufacture an undetectable gun.
[03:50:38.189 --> 03:50:39.330]  So that's already illegal.
[03:50:39.811 --> 03:50:46.637]  And secondly, you can't print, you can't 3D print a gun that works other than to blow up in your face.
[03:50:47.358 --> 03:50:49.159]  Because you have to add metal parts.
[03:50:49.659 --> 03:50:52.460]  Because you have chamber pressures, you know, in the chamber.
[03:50:52.800 --> 03:51:06.486]  You pull the trigger, the firing pin hits the primer on the round, let's say like a 5.56 round in an AR-15, you realize the chamber pressures of that would just completely explode and destroy any kind of polymer or plastic that you could print on a 3D printer.
[03:51:06.807 --> 03:51:07.687]  You can't print an AR-15.
[03:51:07.707 --> 03:51:12.869]  And these left-wing people, they are idiots when it comes to guns.
[03:51:12.909 --> 03:51:14.310]  They don't know how guns work.
[03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:16.311]  I guess they think they work by magic.
[03:51:16.511 --> 03:51:17.591]  No, it's physics.
[03:51:18.172 --> 03:51:19.452]  There's a fast-burning powder.
[03:51:19.532 --> 03:51:20.333]  It creates pressure.
[03:51:20.393 --> 03:51:23.594]  The pressure accelerates the bullet down the rifled barrel.
[03:51:24.234 --> 03:51:25.095]  It's all physics.
[03:51:25.575 --> 03:51:33.359]  And it turns out that when you print a plastic gun, and you try to fire off like a .308 round in it, or a .556 round, it blows up in your face.
[03:51:34.179 --> 03:51:39.046]  So there is no danger from people having 3D printed guns.
[03:51:39.106 --> 03:51:45.374]  And besides, it is legal to manufacture your own gun right now using metal parts.
[03:51:45.474 --> 03:51:46.075]  That's legal.
[03:51:46.716 --> 03:51:49.820]  Federal government has issued many, many decisions on that.
[03:51:49.860 --> 03:51:50.561]  That's legal right now.
[03:51:50.621 --> 03:51:51.502]  You can make your own gun.
[03:51:52.637 --> 03:52:08.525]  You can go get a ghost gunner machine, you can buy an 80% AR receiver, and you can use that machine like a little CNC machine, and you can grind out the metal, and you can fill in the parts, put in the trigger kit, put in the bolt carrier group, all that stuff, you can make your own gun.
[03:52:08.565 --> 03:52:09.666]  That's legal right now!
[03:52:10.166 --> 03:52:10.726]  That's legal.
[03:52:11.847 --> 03:52:17.750]  And this idea that now suddenly that you shouldn't be able to post computer code online,
[03:52:19.127 --> 03:52:20.428]  That that should be illegal?
[03:52:20.968 --> 03:52:22.169]  That is insane.
[03:52:22.209 --> 03:52:23.630]  Because that's an attack on the First Amendment.
[03:52:23.991 --> 03:52:26.152]  Because computer code is speech, okay?
[03:52:26.353 --> 03:52:27.153]  Let's be clear about this.
[03:52:27.213 --> 03:52:28.374]  Computer code is speech.
[03:52:29.255 --> 03:52:36.661]  Even if you post instructions online or you wrote a book, let's say like the Anarchist Cookbook, that even instructs people how to make
[03:52:37.321 --> 03:52:38.802]  You know, explosive materials.
[03:52:39.403 --> 03:52:43.726]  There are many, many uses for that besides any kind of a terrorist use.
[03:52:44.066 --> 03:52:55.355]  And that's why the Anarchist Cookbook or other books, the free speech rights of people to post information that even gives instructions for how to build guns, that has to be protected under First Amendment protections.
[03:52:55.775 --> 03:52:56.056]  You see?
[03:52:56.076 --> 03:52:58.758]  And the legal argument is very strong for that.
[03:52:58.778 --> 03:52:59.699]  There's no question about it.
[03:53:00.619 --> 03:53:08.102]  Granted, somebody could download plans for how to build a bomb and they could bomb, you know, a government building, but that's likely to be Antifa.
[03:53:08.522 --> 03:53:10.903]  That's likely to be leftists.
[03:53:11.063 --> 03:53:18.446]  And their problem is that they're deranged lunatics because of fake news CNN, which is the enemy of the people, driving people into acts of terrorism.
[03:53:18.906 --> 03:53:20.707]  The problem is not the online plans.
[03:53:21.127 --> 03:53:27.290]  The problem is the fake news media driving people insane and turning normal people into terrorists.
[03:53:27.310 --> 03:53:27.870]  Do you understand?
[03:53:28.590 --> 03:53:30.270]  The problem is not 3D printed guns.
[03:53:30.851 --> 03:53:44.373]  The problem is mass brainwashing and indoctrination of the gullible masses on the left who have already been indoctrinated into the school system where they're taught communist ideas and they're taught things that are dangerous to a civil society.
[03:53:44.894 --> 03:53:52.795]  When those people get a hold of equipment, they will use it to murder or cause chaos or cause violence, but they can just go out and buy a gun.
[03:53:53.275 --> 03:53:55.416]  They don't need to make a gun, they can buy a gun.
[03:53:56.630 --> 03:54:04.733]  And if they choose to use those guns to commit violence and crimes in America, then there's going to be a Second Amendment response, by the way.
[03:54:05.373 --> 03:54:07.374]  Just saying, on the record, that's what's going to happen.
[03:54:07.414 --> 03:54:10.155]  So, 3D-printed guns are not the problem.
[03:54:11.336 --> 03:54:19.739]  3D-printed guns, or the gun plans for how to make a gun or how to print a gun, those are constitutionally protected forms of free speech.
[03:54:20.914 --> 03:54:29.600]  And in fact, I have a lot of 3D printers, and I've got CAD CAM design systems, and I've actually designed parts for a food grow system.
[03:54:29.640 --> 03:54:32.662]  It's called the Food Rising Mini Farm Grow System.
[03:54:33.042 --> 03:54:35.544]  We've sold, you know, a few thousand of those over the years.
[03:54:35.584 --> 03:54:37.065]  We actually print our own 3D printed parts.
[03:54:37.345 --> 03:54:49.193]  So I know quite a bit about 3D printers, and I gotta tell you, I would never try to put a cartridge inside a piece of polymer that I printed on my printer and pull the trigger on that.
[03:54:49.273 --> 03:54:50.514]  You know, you would blow up your face.
[03:54:51.195 --> 03:54:52.877]  By the way, not a good scene.
[03:54:53.398 --> 03:54:58.365]  Maybe we should allow Antifa to build 3D printed guns and try them.
[03:54:58.785 --> 03:55:01.429]  Because maybe they're so stupid about guns, they think they'll work?
[03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:03.572]  So they'll have these big plastic ARs?
[03:55:03.993 --> 03:55:04.554]  They look like AR-15s?
[03:55:06.328 --> 03:55:08.711]  They only work once, and they blow up in your face.
[03:55:08.791 --> 03:55:09.932]  So yeah, go ahead, try that.
[03:55:10.172 --> 03:55:12.395]  If you're that stupid, win the Darwin Award.
[03:55:13.116 --> 03:55:13.796]  For America.
[03:55:13.897 --> 03:55:14.217]  Thank you.
[03:55:14.237 --> 03:55:15.318]  Okay.
[03:55:15.659 --> 03:55:15.959]  Alright.
[03:55:16.700 --> 03:55:18.502]  Another news item here to go through.
[03:55:18.522 --> 03:55:21.986]  I want to just talk, we've only got a couple minutes left here, but I want to get into the
[03:55:23.502 --> 03:55:25.443]  The insanity of what they're claiming now.
[03:55:25.503 --> 03:55:29.725]  Celebrities claim that they want Trump supporters euthanized.
[03:55:30.365 --> 03:55:32.005]  This is from a Daily Caller story.
[03:55:34.386 --> 03:55:41.289]  A PBS and NPR contributor says that Trump supporters should be euthanized.
[03:55:41.809 --> 03:55:42.750]  I mean think about this.
[03:55:43.490 --> 03:55:48.333]  Reporters, celebs call Trump supporters Nazis and KKK want them euthanized after a Trump rally.
[03:55:48.914 --> 03:55:58.700]  This is on top of the New York Times editorial board member who goes on this racist rampage saying that white people are quote only fit to live underground like groveling goblins.
[03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:02.963]  And you know I've seen goblins and they're pretty much leftists.
[03:56:03.423 --> 03:56:06.525]  There was a goblin that attacked Alex Jones on the sidewalk a couple years ago.
[03:56:06.565 --> 03:56:07.786]  That was an actual goblin.
[03:56:09.074 --> 03:56:11.356]  It's like right out of Lord of the Rings, man.
[03:56:11.376 --> 03:56:14.799]  It's like, were you born out of the mud slime 15 minutes ago?
[03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:16.260]  Where'd you find those blue jeans?
[03:56:16.581 --> 03:56:18.122]  How'd you get onto the sidewalk here?
[03:56:18.162 --> 03:56:18.723]  That's amazing.
[03:56:19.043 --> 03:56:21.965]  You went from goblin to like half human in record time.
[03:56:21.985 --> 03:56:22.526]  That's amazing.
[03:56:23.266 --> 03:56:27.810]  So she says that all white people are goblins and the New York Times doesn't have a problem with that.
[03:56:28.511 --> 03:56:29.232]  They think that's fine.
[03:56:29.272 --> 03:56:31.213]  So if you're a racist, bigoted,
[03:56:32.094 --> 03:56:36.418]  Discriminatory dingbat, you can work for the New York Times.
[03:56:36.998 --> 03:56:38.159]  Is anyone surprised?
[03:56:38.499 --> 03:56:41.942]  And then these people wonder why real Americans hate the media.
[03:56:42.623 --> 03:56:44.825]  Why we think that CNN is fake news.
[03:56:44.925 --> 03:56:46.826]  Why the New York Times is despised.
[03:56:47.247 --> 03:56:49.228]  Because you're hiring racists.
[03:56:49.809 --> 03:56:51.370]  You are the new KKK.
[03:56:51.790 --> 03:56:55.774]  The NYT is the KKK of the online news world today.
[03:56:55.994 --> 03:56:57.555]  You're hiring racist bigots.
[03:56:58.075 --> 03:57:00.477]  You might as well have her wear a black pointy hood.
[03:57:01.258 --> 03:57:01.998]  Of some kind.
[03:57:02.058 --> 03:57:02.939]  Or a white pointy hood.
[03:57:02.959 --> 03:57:03.999]  Doesn't matter what the color is.
[03:57:04.039 --> 03:57:05.600]  Just put a pointy hood on that girl.
[03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:08.461]  So the world can see what she really is.
[03:57:08.541 --> 03:57:09.202]  She's a racist.
[03:57:10.062 --> 03:57:11.022]  She hates white people.
[03:57:12.503 --> 03:57:13.103]  It's incredible.
[03:57:13.884 --> 03:57:16.465]  And this is the kind of thing that's going on every single day.
[03:57:17.728 --> 03:57:34.171]  The answer, by the way, the solutions to wrap this up, are to continue to support InfoWars.com, support the InfoWars store, share this video, support my video alternative platform, Real.Video, spread the links, spread the news, take part in this!

[03:57:47.273 --> 03:57:48.834]  This is Mike Adams for InfoWars.
[03:57:48.894 --> 03:57:49.434]  I'll see you again.
[03:58:10.307 --> 03:58:12.348]  The globalists are demonizing InfoWars.
[03:58:12.468 --> 03:58:14.250]  We are the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[03:58:14.330 --> 03:58:17.312]  The dreaded organization that they hate so much.
[03:58:17.452 --> 03:58:19.793]  And they are so scared of people power.
[03:58:19.833 --> 03:58:21.414]  They are so scared of you.
[03:58:21.614 --> 03:58:26.297]  Not just downloading the app, but sharing it with your neighbors, your friends, folks at church.
