[00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:15.195]  You know, when I talk about myself on air a lot,
[00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:39.292]  It's so I can relate to people, my thought process, it's the way I communicate.
[00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:46.755]  So I'm not like Obama, in a speech he'll say 300 times, I, I, I, me, me, me, me, me, talk about himself the third person.
[00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:53.238]  I'm doing it because I'm psychoanalyzing myself here on air.
[00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:57.760]  And I'm thinking to myself, why am I so incredibly upset?
[00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:01.735]  Why am I so angry at myself?
[00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:05.457]  Why am I so frustrated that I'm not doing enough?
[00:01:05.457 --> 00:01:16.085]  And it's because the amount of news and information totally proves what we're saying.
[00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:25.652]  And when I see one article, like the one I'm about to hit first, I pull up the data sheet of what I know
[00:01:28.402 --> 00:01:37.725]  And it's like finding 10 million dead children in your backyard, buried.
[00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:39.006]  And they're coming for your kids.
[00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:43.647]  They're coming for mine.
[00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:48.089]  And it's the way they propagandize, the way they compartmentalize.
[00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:53.410]  Everything, just in this one article, I mean, it brought up thousands of things when I was here.
[00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.691]  I hadn't seen this article yet.
[00:01:56.305 --> 00:02:05.628]  But I've seen what happened in other parts of the world, the way the IMF, the way the World Bank handles it, the way the UN handles it.
[00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:07.849]  And I've got all the UN documents.
[00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.349]  They're in America, destroyed by design.
[00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:19.093]  And I just think, you know, if I just get up here and just cover this flippantly and cynically, people won't get how dangerous it is.
[00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:23.174]  And I get really, really angry at myself.
[00:02:23.174 --> 00:02:25.735]  Because if I don't just sarcastically, hatefully say it,
[00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:30.778]  Then I'm going to absorb it and I'm going to start crying.
[00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:34.600]  And then I'm going to start killing people.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.741]  And that's why it's hard.
[00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:42.263]  And I know why people don't want to face all this because it's hard.
[00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:44.324]  It's hard.
[00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:51.726]  They're putting polio in the vaccines.
[00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:55.408]  And when I warn people about this historic fact that's ongoing in America now,
[00:02:57.483 --> 00:02:59.204]  They're testing to see what they can get away with here now.
[00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:05.165]  They've done it all over.
[00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:06.286]  I know the pre-programming.
[00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.186]  Oh, Jones is against vaccines.
[00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:09.426]  He doesn't believe in science.
[00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:12.247]  We're not talking about vaccines.
[00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:20.290]  We're talking about injecting black people in Alabama with syphilis for 48 years.
[00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.691]  We're talking about injecting Appalachians for 60 years with syphilis.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.721]  Poor white people.
[00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:39.091]  We're talking about thousands of confirmed UN events where they've been caught adding steroids to the vaccines.
[00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:43.094]  And then we have the UN programs.
[00:03:43.094 --> 00:03:46.177]  And it makes me so angry because I know how the medical system works.
[00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:50.120]  My dad managed hospitals, dental clinics.
[00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.932]  My dad told me, don't sign your organ donor card.
[00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:56.795]  Hospitals in Dallas kill people and take their organs.
[00:03:56.795 --> 00:04:07.426]  I thought he was crazy, and a decade later, 60 Minutes, named Dallas in Chicago, caught red-handed killing people.
[00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:13.292]  And you have to understand, most of your real high-level assassins are medical doctors.
[00:04:14.844 --> 00:04:18.305]  That's like the most elite killers they use are doctors.
[00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.685]  See, because killers give life and they take life.
[00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.926]  Doctors give life and they take life.
[00:04:23.926 --> 00:04:28.667]  So I could talk for the whole rest of the hour about ABC News even in medicine.
[00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:37.229]  It slips out because people don't even know what they're seeing.
[00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.089]  They're giving you polio.
[00:04:40.538 --> 00:04:50.209]  And when your child gets paralyzed, they admit that the hospitals are ordered not to report it as vaccine-induced contracted polio.
[00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:55.515]  My grandmother was given polio and the polio vaccine on purpose.
[00:04:55.515 --> 00:04:56.636]  She's dead now.
[00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:57.277]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:06.663]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:05:06.663 --> 00:05:08.205]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:13.130]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.054]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[00:05:16.574 --> 00:05:19.337]  A free gift with every order.
[00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:28.186]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:31.869]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:37.234]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:39.617]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[00:05:40.157 --> 00:05:45.019]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:46.539]  So, this is a loss leader.
[00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.119]  We are losing money on this.
[00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:49.560]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.561]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:52.881]  And don't fight the crowds.
[00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:54.321]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.842]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:56.162]  Big Brother.
[00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:13.068]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:15.650]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.572]  You want answers?
[00:06:17.572 --> 00:06:19.474]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:25.780]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:46.268]  Google is evil!
[00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:47.409]  Google is evil!
[00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.975]  Google is going to buy ideas and violate them all!
[00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:54.658]  That's enough.
[00:06:54.658 --> 00:06:56.781]  Make too much noise.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:11.728]  Before we delve into these questions, I must first dispense with a completely illegitimate issue, which is the fantasy, dreamed up by some conservatives, that Google and other online platforms have an anti-conservative bias.
[00:07:11.728 --> 00:07:13.529]  But what if Google was lying to you?
[00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.592]  As I've said repeatedly, no credible evidence supports this right-wing conspiracy theory.
[00:07:18.592 --> 00:07:23.875]  Here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activism.
[00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:26.757]  When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come with a
[00:07:27.297 --> 00:07:36.908]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:07:36.908 --> 00:07:38.810]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.434]  Does the United States need a national privacy law?
[00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:46.598]  So what am I supposed to do?
[00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:48.019]  I don't get a day in court.
[00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:48.799]  They lie about me.
[00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:50.700]  Google only puts lies up.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.901]  All the top searches are lies about me and my family.
[00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:57.424]  The other issue I wanted to just raise in my last minute is moderating hate speech.
[00:07:57.424 --> 00:07:58.304]  Hate speech.
[00:07:58.304 --> 00:07:58.984]  Hate speech.
[00:07:58.984 --> 00:07:59.585]  Hate speech.
[00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:00.285]  Hate speech.
[00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:01.166]  Hate speech.
[00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:02.566]  And bullying policies.
[00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:07.749]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:09.390]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.251]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:12.692]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar.
[00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:20.780]  This has come up in a number of different ways and we appreciate the work that you have done particularly with YouTube.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.825]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories.
[00:08:25.825 --> 00:08:30.890]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.730]  We're aware of his lying to Congress.
[00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.331]  We're aware of him and the Dragonfly Project.
[00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:37.132]  It's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:38.872]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[00:08:38.872 --> 00:08:43.113]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[00:08:43.113 --> 00:08:48.374]  Translation, Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[00:08:48.374 --> 00:08:49.495]  Google is evil!
[00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.015]  Google is evil!
[00:08:51.015 --> 00:08:53.616]  Google would love to have me arrested and killed.
[00:09:09.998 --> 00:09:12.979]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, December 13th, 2018.
[00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:17.341]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:21.463]  Gavin McInnes is going to be in studio with us for the second and third hour today.
[00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:23.084]  Really looking forward to that.
[00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:24.925]  He's one of the most banned people out there in the world.
[00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:29.588]  He's in his bander, as hated as I am, but he's getting close.
[00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:31.949]  Let's show him to that brass ring.
[00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:33.390]  That means you're over the target.
[00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.872]  Great guy, I got a chance to hang out with him last night.
[00:09:35.872 --> 00:09:38.433]  We're going to have him in studio for several hours.
[00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:40.314]  Appreciate him coming to Austin.
[00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:42.135]  He just got kicked off CRTV.
[00:09:42.135 --> 00:09:47.478]  The old Becky Pooh, one day after Beck merged with it and basically got control of it.
[00:09:48.761 --> 00:09:50.902]  But I'm sure Glenn Beck had nothing to do with that.
[00:09:50.902 --> 00:10:04.830]  I just know behind the scenes he tried to kick me off all these radio stations and ruin my operation and has worked tirelessly to stop any competition he sees to himself being number one.
[00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.712]  So that's all coming up with Gavin McInnes.
[00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:11.373]  He's not going to be getting into Glenn Beck or any of that.
[00:10:13.402 --> 00:10:21.616]  Okay, I kind of got, I don't want to say sidetracked onto Google and AI yesterday, because it's really, really central and very, very important, obviously.
[00:10:21.616 --> 00:10:25.262]  But I do want to hit some of the other cultural issues and things.
[00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.511]  And then just sit back and ask people, do they want to put up with this?
[00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:42.314]  And I most importantly want to talk to the folks that are driving down the road for the first time and tuning through AM or FM radio, or flipping through the TV channels, and they go, who's this?
[00:10:42.314 --> 00:10:47.015]  And then you see the name Alex Jones for the first time, you go, oh, I heard he's the bad guy.
[00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:55.147]  And then you have the mental image of what thousands of newspapers and TV stations have said about me that's not true.
[00:10:55.147 --> 00:10:56.248]  Why would they do that?
[00:10:56.248 --> 00:11:00.532]  Why would they spend so much time and energy trying to shut me down and destroy me?
[00:11:00.532 --> 00:11:04.155]  Because I've got their number.
[00:11:04.155 --> 00:11:06.857]  And I also know how to defeat the globalists.
[00:11:06.857 --> 00:11:10.020]  You see, we're compartmentalized.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.663]  And less than one-tenth of one percent
[00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:31.714]  Less than one-tenth of one percent of the people in the world are working for the globalists, consciously carrying out these evil operations.
[00:11:31.714 --> 00:11:42.479]  Different ideologies are prepared and rolled out by the globalists to set up the building blocks of what they then move into new projects and construct.
[00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:43.340]  And it's done in phases.
[00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:53.591]  And it is a totally sci-fi, diabolic, 170-year plan we have been living under.
[00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:57.953]  It is, incidentally, a 200-year plan.
[00:11:57.953 --> 00:12:02.995]  It's supposed to be done in 30 years.
[00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:04.496]  And I used to think they were behind.
[00:12:04.496 --> 00:12:07.477]  They're really right on schedule.
[00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.838]  But the awakening's bigger than they thought it would be.
[00:12:09.838 --> 00:12:11.059]  They knew it was coming.
[00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:13.099]  They've been preparing for it.
[00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.140]  But you need to understand something.
[00:12:16.272 --> 00:12:24.996]  It is an absolute fact that the cell phones are designed to track, trace, control you and also radiate you and kill you.
[00:12:24.996 --> 00:12:43.044]  It is a fact that nanotech is added to all the major vaccines and that everyone is having introduced into them binary weapon systems that can be activated to kill you at the time of the establishment's choosing, either chemically or magnetically
[00:12:45.579 --> 00:13:08.868]  It is a fact that the globalists are setting up a atmosphere and a system for a class of civilizations, a giant religious world war, and an artificial Armageddon to reduce population and bring in an AI run world government.
[00:13:08.868 --> 00:13:09.848]  That's their admitted point.
[00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:22.522]  And we're entering the final phases of beta testing, and you're going to have one in three children unable to speak within 15 years.
[00:13:22.522 --> 00:13:27.744]  You're going to have about half the population with cancer by 2027.
[00:13:27.744 --> 00:13:31.005]  That's only eight, nine years away.
[00:13:32.443 --> 00:13:53.740]  You are going to watch your children die, watch your wife, your husband, everyone, and it's all going to be hyped up of what's doing in, and they're going to ease you into it, and, oh, we've got to find what's doing in or find the cure, and there'll be lots of races and runs, and America and the world will gut up, and we don't know why we're all dying when it's all being done on purpose.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.242]  You and your family are being murdered.
[00:13:56.242 --> 00:13:59.245]  And if you're driving down the road for the first time hearing this, you have to understand something.
[00:14:00.828 --> 00:14:02.611]  All of this is completely admitted.
[00:14:02.611 --> 00:14:05.155]  And if I tried to give you all the evidence, it would take 5,000 years.
[00:14:05.155 --> 00:14:10.363]  But let's just use a few that everybody's heard of.
[00:14:10.363 --> 00:14:13.508]  Remember how Hillary, when she was Secretary of State, apologized.
[00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:14.370]  It's always a sick joke.
[00:14:15.706 --> 00:14:16.646]  For the U.S.
[00:14:16.646 --> 00:14:25.731]  government giving people in Africa, Latin America, and the Appalachias, and the rural South syphilis in the Tuskegee operation.
[00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.451]  That was only one name.
[00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:30.553]  It wasn't Operation Tuskegee, but it's called Tuskegee popularly.
[00:14:30.553 --> 00:14:35.315]  That was just one little thing of it going on at the University there in Tuskegee.
[00:14:35.315 --> 00:14:38.597]  Now, see, the reason that's important is, it is completely confirmed.
[00:14:38.597 --> 00:14:41.658]  I have an ABC News report right here, but it's local Chicago.
[00:14:41.658 --> 00:14:43.799]  This wouldn't go out national because they didn't know what they were reporting on.
[00:14:44.923 --> 00:14:56.288]  And they say, you know, we've talked to the hospitals and yeah, they're not reporting people are dying and being paralyzed from polio, a virus that eats your nerves.
[00:14:56.288 --> 00:14:57.388]  Now again, a whole other subject.
[00:14:57.388 --> 00:15:04.811]  My grandmother who died last year at 90, 92, she got the first round of flu vaccine and it was spreading the faster the vaccine came out.
[00:15:06.707 --> 00:15:27.468]  And then she got the second round for a new mutation and got it a week later and the doctor told her, while she was there in the hospital room with the iron lung, told her, yes Benny Grace Hammond, you got it, you have the strain from the vaccine.
[00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.430]  We haven't perfected it yet, we're sorry.
[00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:33.441]  We're sorry.
[00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:34.382]  So this is my life.
[00:15:34.382 --> 00:15:48.994]  I don't need to just read this, but tens of thousands of children are dying right now across America after they get the shot for polio and the government's ordering it covered up.
[00:15:48.994 --> 00:15:49.875]  Do you understand?
[00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:52.377]  This is a planned program to test.
[00:15:52.377 --> 00:15:54.639]  I'm going to explain how they run it when we come back.
[00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:56.060]  They're coming to kill your children.
[00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:01.001]  Hear that?
[00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:06.383]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:09.283]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:16:09.283 --> 00:16:12.864]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[00:16:59.255 --> 00:17:05.597]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:05.597 --> 00:17:08.638]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.638 --> 00:17:14.200]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.343]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:18.343 --> 00:17:19.604]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:20.625]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:27.150]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:16.385]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.385 --> 00:20:22.488]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:31.572]  You know, I don't want to get into anything personal with the crew here in Austin, but I know two people in this building
[00:20:33.502 --> 00:20:38.945]  His children died after they were given a vaccine.
[00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:43.348]  My grandmother almost died from the polio vaccine.
[00:20:43.348 --> 00:20:46.530]  They told her it gave her polio.
[00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:58.036]  I was visiting the biggest owner of pediatrician facilities 10 years ago for a visit, a well-checked for my first daughter.
[00:20:58.036 --> 00:21:00.858]  And the owner of the clinics, he's since retired,
[00:21:02.987 --> 00:21:08.070]  One of the few big clinic chains that doesn't push vaccines on you said, I hear you're opting out.
[00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.812]  And the nurse goes out and he goes, damn right.
[00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:25.320]  You know, we have these city clinics where you're supposed to, you know, doctors volunteer at the start of the school year and you go out and you go to these, uh, gymnasiums and places and we vaccinate thousands of children.
[00:21:26.755 --> 00:21:40.065]  He goes, I refuse to do it now, because we were giving him a live polio vaccine from the 1960s that's been banned since the 70s by law.
[00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:44.548]  And I go, I know, doctor, because it's got live SV40 cancer virus.
[00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:47.170]  He goes, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.531]  You know, this is a big, tough businessman guy.
[00:21:49.531 --> 00:21:50.332]  I'm just leaving it at that.
[00:21:50.332 --> 00:21:52.714]  People listening to me probably know what I'm talking about.
[00:21:52.714 --> 00:21:54.135]  And all of a sudden, he grabs me by the arm.
[00:21:54.135 --> 00:21:55.636]  He goes, don't you say my name.
[00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:58.430]  And see, he was having a moment of conscience.
[00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.272]  And I just want to explain to you.
[00:22:00.272 --> 00:22:05.376]  My dad knew enough in the Dallas scene, because he wasn't just a dentist or a surgeon.
[00:22:05.376 --> 00:22:07.017]  He did medical management.
[00:22:07.017 --> 00:22:11.221]  He leased and sold systems to hospitals.
[00:22:11.221 --> 00:22:21.329]  He owned a hospital for a while in Rowlett or Mesquite.
[00:22:21.329 --> 00:22:22.470]  And it was well known.
[00:22:24.642 --> 00:22:31.564]  That there were doctors, surgeons, that if somebody could be alive, not even hurt bad, they'd kill your ass and get your organs.
[00:22:31.564 --> 00:22:34.525]  Now, let me explain something.
[00:22:34.525 --> 00:22:36.006]  This is what later came out on 60 Minutes.
[00:22:36.006 --> 00:22:41.428]  What I'm trying to tell you is, ladies and gentlemen, in Africa, in Asia, all over,
[00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:43.881]  It's on the local news.
[00:22:43.881 --> 00:22:58.284]  The UN came, and they all gave us vaccines, and all the babies and the pregnant women stopped moving a day later, and they had miscarriages, and many of the children became paralyzed and died, and here is my daughter, and the daughter is totally paralyzed.
[00:22:58.284 --> 00:23:00.884]  She lives, but it's worse than death.
[00:23:00.884 --> 00:23:05.565]  This has been, I've been seeing this and reading this for decades.
[00:23:05.565 --> 00:23:09.086]  You know, the Africans and people, they used to love it when the white man doctor showed up.
[00:23:12.278 --> 00:23:14.739]  And they think, oh, big, big medicine.
[00:23:14.739 --> 00:23:22.462]  But now, all over the world, from Thailand to Burma to Nigeria, the people run.
[00:23:22.462 --> 00:23:23.582]  And they now bring in U.N.
[00:23:23.582 --> 00:23:26.883]  troops and make you take your shots.
[00:23:26.883 --> 00:23:27.524]  And then the U.N.
[00:23:27.524 --> 00:23:28.544]  gets caught doing it.
[00:23:28.544 --> 00:23:32.606]  So what they're doing is beta testing.
[00:23:32.606 --> 00:23:36.387]  How many people can we give tainted vaccine and give them polio?
[00:23:39.522 --> 00:23:47.865]  And how many people can we give tetanus shot that actually has a hormone added to it so the body has an autoimmune response to the hormone and then it causes sterilization?
[00:23:47.865 --> 00:23:48.846]  In second trimester.
[00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:50.767]  It's not classic sterilization.
[00:23:50.767 --> 00:23:58.190]  It's a programmed autoimmune response where the baby is attacked in the second trimester when the hormone is released.
[00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.312]  So it's actually a very violent, painful autoimmune disease given to women to kill their babies.
[00:24:05.021 --> 00:24:10.723]  Very vicious soft kill weapon, which is designed to debilitate the people as well.
[00:24:10.723 --> 00:24:25.849]  Again, the 223 round developed in Vietnam to get around the Geneva Convention is actually designed to maim, not to kill, to cause maximum weight on the enemy operation.
[00:24:25.849 --> 00:24:27.990]  These are silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:29.951]  These are soft kill weapons.
[00:24:29.951 --> 00:24:30.511]  So I'll explain.
[00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:32.572]  We have a globalist breakaway civilization
[00:24:35.023 --> 00:24:38.884]  That is, you know, classically and it's declassified.
[00:24:38.884 --> 00:24:44.526]  It just becomes a rumor like, oh, I heard Alex Jones say the smartphones track you 20 years ago and it's all true.
[00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:53.589]  Or Jones said 17 years ago that the cell phones and the computers are listening to you with keywords and recording it all for data and for advertising.
[00:24:53.589 --> 00:24:55.069]  Now it's all admitted.
[00:24:55.069 --> 00:24:55.890]  It wasn't rumors.
[00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.871]  I was reading to you from the leaked documents from the whistleblowers.
[00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:03.048]  That's the same thing.
[00:25:03.048 --> 00:25:17.172]  They come out and they give children and adults, before my dad quit practicing dentistry, he still did it like three days a week, maybe to all the old patients he'd had for decades that loved him, they'd come in and they'd be on the edge of death.
[00:25:17.172 --> 00:25:30.036]  He saw one time, he said more than 10 patients in a week who had shingles, which is just herpes all over the body.
[00:25:30.036 --> 00:25:30.776]  But they give it another name.
[00:25:33.124 --> 00:25:39.628]  And they'd say, oh, Dr. Jones, old black ladies, old white ladies, you name it, some wealthy, some not.
[00:25:39.628 --> 00:25:41.789]  See, that was some of the stories.
[00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:43.410]  He said it was all demographics.
[00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.211]  And they'd just be like, I was doing great.
[00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:49.334]  And I went into Walgreens and got my shingle shot.
[00:25:49.334 --> 00:25:51.615]  And I don't know why I got it a week later.
[00:25:51.615 --> 00:25:53.716]  They may have to amputate my leg.
[00:25:53.716 --> 00:25:57.058]  And then they did amputate her leg.
[00:25:57.058 --> 00:26:00.280]  And I'm just watching people walk into machine gun fire.
[00:26:04.031 --> 00:26:11.897]  And every day, man paralyzed after flu shot, baby dies after flu shot.
[00:26:11.897 --> 00:26:22.506]  Most every time I'm on vacation, there'll be families out at the pool, they'll have two or three kids, and they've always got a little boy who's autistic and going, and you feel very sad for him.
[00:26:22.506 --> 00:26:24.227]  They're howling at the moon, whatever.
[00:26:24.227 --> 00:26:27.409]  And I always said, oh, what's wrong with your son?
[00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.950]  Poor thing.
[00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.171]  Oh, he's got autism.
[00:26:30.233 --> 00:26:31.174]  And I go, when did it happen?
[00:26:31.174 --> 00:26:33.715]  Well, at 18 months, we think it was the vaccine.
[00:26:33.715 --> 00:26:42.280]  We, we were driving home after he got the shot at the school and he started convulsing and he was asleep for a day and we took him to the doctor and they just said, just a bad reaction.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:42.940]  He'll be fine.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.162]  He was 18 months old running and talking and walking.
[00:26:46.162 --> 00:26:50.985]  And he, he, he, he didn't walk for about a year after that, but he's four now.
[00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:56.048]  And you know, he, we think he might be able to live on his own someday if we work hard enough with it.
[00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:59.690]  It's just everywhere, everywhere.
[00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:06.348]  My dad's brother, never in the hospital, never sick.
[00:27:06.348 --> 00:27:12.171]  Had the scouts out there wanting him in high school to skip college and go right to pro baseball.
[00:27:12.171 --> 00:27:16.994]  Took a tetanus shot, had to go to the hospital for a week, almost killed him.
[00:27:16.994 --> 00:27:19.015]  And he was always a little retarded after that.
[00:27:23.152 --> 00:27:25.913]  My whole family's just been devastated!
[00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:26.994]  Me, personally!
[00:27:26.994 --> 00:27:33.557]  And I could walk right out that room and talk to the British man whose child died when they were given a vaccine.
[00:27:33.557 --> 00:27:34.057]  By the U.S.
[00:27:34.057 --> 00:27:36.738]  military, because they were in the military at the time.
[00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:39.960]  While they were on deployment.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:45.802]  They'll take your child, and they'll run him full of this poison, and they'll kill him!
[00:27:45.802 --> 00:27:46.703]  And that's if they're lucky!
[00:27:46.703 --> 00:27:49.464]  Instead of being brain damaged for the rest of their life!
[00:27:51.532 --> 00:27:54.155]  25, 30-year-old men drinking out of bottles!
[00:27:54.155 --> 00:27:56.758]  Wearing diapers!
[00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:58.700]  A chemical warfare lobotomy!
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.502]  And that's the old-fashioned tech.
[00:28:00.502 --> 00:28:06.309]  They got nanotech now in the vaccines.
[00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:08.292]  And they have this weird metaphysic rule.
[00:28:09.795 --> 00:28:13.476]  That they have to get you to consent and bring your child to do it.
[00:28:13.476 --> 00:28:14.696]  And the doctors all know it.
[00:28:14.696 --> 00:28:15.737]  The nurses all know it.
[00:28:15.737 --> 00:28:17.517]  That's why they want to fire the nurses.
[00:28:17.517 --> 00:28:18.917]  Most of the nurses won't take it.
[00:28:18.917 --> 00:28:20.438]  You know, we've had nurse whistleblowers on.
[00:28:20.438 --> 00:28:22.418]  It's been in the news, too.
[00:28:22.418 --> 00:28:27.700]  Where in the preemie wards, the bioethics board above the doctors tells them, give them shots.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.401]  Didn't used to, you didn't give a preemie a shot.
[00:28:30.401 --> 00:28:35.362]  And they go in, they put them on respirators as they give them the shot, because a lot of them die on the spot.
[00:28:35.362 --> 00:28:38.783]  And under the eugenics rule, it's a lethal injection is what it really is.
[00:28:39.727 --> 00:28:40.367]  And let's expand.
[00:28:40.367 --> 00:28:47.633]  The Clintons, for over a decade, knowingly shipped HIV and Hepatitis blood out of the prison, certifying it as healthy to be given to people all over America and the world.
[00:28:47.633 --> 00:28:53.317]  They estimate more than 5 million people contracted HIV and Hepatitis, and most of them have now died.
[00:28:53.317 --> 00:28:54.818]  3 million plus dead.
[00:28:54.818 --> 00:28:56.699]  The Clintons did it on purpose.
[00:28:56.699 --> 00:28:57.880]  They love murdering people.
[00:29:00.894 --> 00:29:04.056]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[00:29:04.056 --> 00:29:08.299]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:09.700]  The bug assault.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:14.384]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:17.757]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.
[00:29:17.757 --> 00:29:21.099]  So much fun, you'll forget you have a wife and kids!
[00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:22.920]  Makes the perfect stocking stuffer.

[00:29:29.103 --> 00:29:37.787]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:29:38.007 --> 00:29:38.547]  Everybody knows it.
[00:29:38.547 --> 00:29:39.087]  History documents it.
[00:29:39.087 --> 00:29:41.968]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history.
[00:30:07.685 --> 00:30:09.186]  That wants to hurt children.
[00:30:09.186 --> 00:30:10.327]  They want to abort children.
[00:30:10.327 --> 00:30:12.068]  They want to disease children.
[00:30:12.068 --> 00:30:13.189]  They want to abuse children.
[00:30:13.189 --> 00:30:14.810]  They want to confuse children.
[00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:15.991]  They want their essence.
[00:30:15.991 --> 00:30:16.951]  They want their soul.
[00:30:16.951 --> 00:30:18.272]  They want their spirit.
[00:30:18.272 --> 00:30:20.054]  They want their power.
[00:30:20.054 --> 00:30:22.275]  Because they are our future.
[00:30:22.275 --> 00:30:25.778]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[00:30:25.778 --> 00:30:27.759]  It is about the West.
[00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:31.902]  And it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[00:30:31.902 --> 00:30:33.483]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[00:30:34.605 --> 00:30:45.194]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[00:30:45.194 --> 00:30:47.256]  You have the power to override the censors.
[00:30:47.256 --> 00:30:50.919]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:59.427]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[00:31:00.445 --> 00:31:09.488]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[00:31:09.488 --> 00:31:10.829]  We've been proven dead on.
[00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:14.690]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.312]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[00:31:19.312 --> 00:31:20.372]  Words are not enough.
[00:31:21.198 --> 00:31:27.381]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[00:31:27.381 --> 00:31:33.584]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[00:31:33.584 --> 00:31:37.586]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[00:31:37.586 --> 00:31:39.507]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[00:31:39.507 --> 00:31:43.489]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globally anti-human future.
[00:31:44.079 --> 00:31:49.763]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[00:31:49.763 --> 00:31:59.050]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[00:32:00.413 --> 00:32:07.874]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[00:32:07.874 --> 00:32:17.136]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[00:32:17.136 --> 00:32:26.198]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[00:32:27.148 --> 00:32:38.594]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[00:32:38.594 --> 00:32:47.758]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[00:32:48.038 --> 00:32:49.439]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:10.316 --> 00:33:25.082]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[00:33:25.082 --> 00:33:34.105]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[00:33:34.105 --> 00:33:35.406]  Perhaps you had better
[00:33:40.216 --> 00:33:45.762]  Perhaps you had better stop from the beginning.
[00:33:45.762 --> 00:33:50.927]  Perhaps you had better stop from the beginning.
[00:33:50.927 --> 00:33:53.850]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.452]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:33:56.452 --> 00:33:58.915]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:07.411]  Mercury-containing vacuums may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:34:07.411 --> 00:34:14.312]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:34:14.312 --> 00:34:19.293]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[00:34:19.293 --> 00:34:22.234]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[00:34:22.234 --> 00:34:26.534]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[00:34:26.534 --> 00:34:29.515]  We're gonna have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[00:34:30.815 --> 00:34:34.860]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.902]  Well, join me.
[00:34:35.902 --> 00:34:38.525]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:34:38.525 --> 00:34:41.909]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:48.256]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[00:35:09.322 --> 00:35:12.484]  Why was Gavin McInnes banned off of almost every platform?
[00:35:12.484 --> 00:35:16.366]  Well, dear TV viewer, you know why.
[00:35:16.366 --> 00:35:19.287]  You know why.
[00:35:19.287 --> 00:35:37.556]  Because he dared to create an organization that was proud of America, that was inclusive of Christians, of Jews, of straight, of gay men who aren't ashamed of being men, aren't ashamed of America, and who go out peacefully, 10 to 1,
[00:35:39.042 --> 00:35:48.870]  When Antifa tries to hit men, women, and children with metal clubs, bike locks, you name it, when they are attacked, they would kick their ass in self-defense.
[00:35:48.870 --> 00:36:05.883]  And that good John Wayne image, for real, is why it has to be deplatformed, because the paramilitary arm of the system, of the globalists, of the left, I mean, we posted a video yesterday to Infowars.com exclusively.
[00:36:07.634 --> 00:36:13.897]  Of Antifa hitting people with clubs, throwing eggs at them, attacking them, who came to protest the mayor.
[00:36:13.897 --> 00:36:26.044]  And the police stand down in Portland and let Antifa, who are mainly professors and city employees in masks, government employees in masks, beat you!
[00:36:26.044 --> 00:36:29.105]  Just like Hitler's brown shirts.
[00:36:29.105 --> 00:36:35.809]  And so you can't let American men organize to go out and peacefully stand with those that want to protest.
[00:36:37.045 --> 00:36:40.666]  And enjoy the First Amendment when the police work for the system.
[00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:49.290]  You know, under the Strong Cities Initiative, the federal government under Obama tried to make all police departments capitulate and go under UN monitors.
[00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:55.992]  Not just the Justice Department, UN monitors.
[00:36:55.992 --> 00:37:00.774]  The video is posted on Infowars.com.
[00:37:00.774 --> 00:37:04.075]  Shock video, Antifa terrorizes local Portland residents protesting mayor.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:14.343]  So, he'll be in studio with us, but let me just go back to where I was.
[00:37:14.343 --> 00:37:26.690]  Every time they go out and vaccinate people, they say, well, viruses like polio are giving people polio, and there's no known vaccine for what this is doing.
[00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:36.395]  But we know from all over the world and major medical groups that have gone and done studies, that it is the UN Vaccines and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that are financing this.
[00:37:40.128 --> 00:37:47.032]  There's an article out today about smart tattoos will actually be microchips in the future.
[00:37:47.032 --> 00:37:50.615]  And they're already here to tell you basic things.
[00:37:50.615 --> 00:37:59.240]  And they just implant colored microbeads that are digital, that then have information implanted on them.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.682]  And it's literally the mark of the beast.
[00:38:01.682 --> 00:38:06.065]  A hologram digital number in the forehead of the hand to buy and sell.
[00:38:09.022 --> 00:38:10.163]  And guess what?
[00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:12.665]  Many of them are going to be flesh-colored.
[00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:14.246]  So, it's simply in your skin.
[00:38:14.246 --> 00:38:16.027]  The chips are in your skin.
[00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:22.092]  Revelation to the exact T, 2,000 years later.
[00:38:22.092 --> 00:38:30.778]  And whether you believe the Bible's true or not, the globalists are manifesting it.
[00:38:30.778 --> 00:38:31.799]  So, that's where we are.
[00:38:31.799 --> 00:38:38.184]  And that's where this planet is going.
[00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.860]  And that's where things have been directed.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.185]  A lot of people say, this is really, really, really scary.
[00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:47.907]  Why are you trying to scare us and demoralize us?
[00:38:47.907 --> 00:38:49.990]  No, I believe you're fighters.
[00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.911]  I believe you're smart.
[00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:52.793]  And I know.
[00:38:53.885 --> 00:38:59.287]  That they want to get all this institutionalized and just standard, like, oh, we're not tracking you with your phone.
[00:38:59.287 --> 00:39:01.028]  Then they admit they were 20 years ago.
[00:39:01.028 --> 00:39:02.748]  Oh, we're not listening to you in your house.
[00:39:02.748 --> 00:39:04.149]  Now they admit they are.
[00:39:04.149 --> 00:39:05.810]  Oh, there's nothing in the vaccines.
[00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.310]  And then they admit they're doing it.
[00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.651]  They have a history of secret testing, killing people, you name it.
[00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:12.592]  And it's not even your average doctor.
[00:39:12.592 --> 00:39:15.633]  Even though almost none of them take vaccines.
[00:39:15.633 --> 00:39:18.215]  I know a lot of medical doctors in town.
[00:39:18.215 --> 00:39:21.536]  Every one of them is a fan.
[00:39:21.536 --> 00:39:22.016]  Every one of them.
[00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:36.805]  We had our, with my new wife, a baby a year and a half ago, wonderful, healthy, little sweet angel, thank God, and I have three daughters and one son.
[00:39:36.805 --> 00:39:44.268]  And the doctor we had before was retired, and so we just looked at who was the highly rated and good.
[00:39:44.268 --> 00:39:50.170]  Sure enough, total listener, nurse, total listener, other nurse, total listeners.
[00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.111]  Medical doctor lives in my neighborhood, total listener.
[00:39:52.964 --> 00:39:57.146]  Another medical doctor that I see, never even knew he was a listener.
[00:39:57.146 --> 00:39:59.408]  And he goes, man, I've been listening to everything for years, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:59.408 --> 00:40:00.889]  He goes, of course you're right about the vaccines.
[00:40:00.889 --> 00:40:02.550]  Of course they're putting all this stuff in them.
[00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.491]  You know, look into this such and such and such study.
[00:40:04.491 --> 00:40:05.752]  They've been doing it at least 30 years.
[00:40:05.752 --> 00:40:07.873]  I mean, they all know, okay?
[00:40:07.873 --> 00:40:15.397]  Like my dad's saying, son, I'm going to come home from work early today and I'm going to take you up there to do your driving test.
[00:40:15.397 --> 00:40:19.260]  Do not sign the organ donor card.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:19.920]  Do not opt in.
[00:40:23.677 --> 00:40:25.518]  I said, why?
[00:40:25.518 --> 00:40:28.999]  He said, a lot of these hospitals in Dallas will kill you.
[00:40:28.999 --> 00:40:34.701]  If you're in a car wreck or something and aren't even close to brain dead, especially if you're young and healthy.
[00:40:34.701 --> 00:40:40.984]  And he said back then, you know, your organs worth about $300,000, be about a million today, in today's numbers.
[00:40:40.984 --> 00:40:48.887]  Now that was 30 years ago.
[00:40:48.887 --> 00:40:50.048]  And I remember rolling my eyes.
[00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:52.242]  I'm saying, oh, come on, Dad.
[00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:53.782]  You know how smart my dad was.
[00:40:53.782 --> 00:41:01.366]  And then years later, I'm sitting there watching 60 Minutes with my grandparents in Austin.
[00:41:01.366 --> 00:41:12.611]  And there was the whole show about Dallas and Chicago killing people for their organs.
[00:41:12.611 --> 00:41:13.472]  Austin does it, too.
[00:41:13.472 --> 00:41:15.453]  And they try to spin it, oh, before they're dead.
[00:41:16.681 --> 00:41:18.701]  They keep you alive while they're taking them out.
[00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:21.962]  We're talking about people that don't even have brain damage.
[00:41:21.962 --> 00:41:26.603]  They'll put your ass under and kill you.
[00:41:26.603 --> 00:41:28.883]  Now, who ran the Nazi hierarchy?
[00:41:28.883 --> 00:41:32.144]  Who decided who to kill and who to keep alive?
[00:41:32.144 --> 00:41:33.984]  It was doctors!
[00:41:33.984 --> 00:41:35.024]  They wrote up the plans.
[00:41:35.024 --> 00:41:35.924]  They worked with IBM.
[00:41:35.924 --> 00:41:36.725]  It was all medical.
[00:41:36.725 --> 00:41:40.065]  It was bioethics!
[00:41:40.065 --> 00:41:44.606]  But see, this global system targets everybody except the establishment.
[00:41:45.455 --> 00:41:51.736]  They can be Indian, they can be Chinese, they can be Jewish, they can be white Anglo-Saxon.
[00:41:51.736 --> 00:42:00.819]  You just got to be in the inner club and then you eat organic food, you drink purified water, they get clean vaccines that actually do work, but you don't get them.
[00:42:00.819 --> 00:42:06.360]  So just remember that, ladies and gentlemen, with the peer pressure and they do all this, they're trying to make it mandatory to do all this.
[00:42:07.705 --> 00:42:12.788]  Trying to take the age of consent away for sex in California, but also saying they've done it.
[00:42:12.788 --> 00:42:18.272]  10 year olds can say, no mommy, I'm getting a $200 free debit card when I get my vaccines.
[00:42:18.272 --> 00:42:23.775]  So your children can countermand the parents in California.
[00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:25.136]  And now that's going nationwide.
[00:42:25.136 --> 00:42:27.698]  Let me just plug real quick.
[00:42:27.698 --> 00:42:29.639]  Without you funding us, we won't be here.
[00:42:29.639 --> 00:42:31.660]  Plus we make it really easy to support us.
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.462]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:37.481]  50 to 75% off everything storewide.
[00:42:37.481 --> 00:42:40.662]  Double patriot points and a free t-shirt.
[00:42:40.662 --> 00:42:44.965]  You pick the size, but it's a mystery t-shirt because we're selling out everything with every order.
[00:42:44.965 --> 00:42:46.446]  This is the biggest deal ever.
[00:42:46.446 --> 00:42:47.226]  Super clearance sale.
[00:42:47.226 --> 00:42:48.407]  Thank you for your support.
[00:42:48.407 --> 00:42:52.189]  If you've never been a supporter, you've never tried the products, you really should.
[00:42:52.189 --> 00:42:53.950]  This is the best way to try them.
[00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.931]  Infowarsstore.com 60% off all super blue.
[00:42:59.144 --> 00:43:05.554]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:43:05.554 --> 00:43:07.116]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:43:07.116 --> 00:43:12.023]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[00:43:12.023 --> 00:43:14.948]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[00:43:15.468 --> 00:43:18.211]  A free gift with every order.
[00:43:18.211 --> 00:43:27.078]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[00:43:27.078 --> 00:43:30.741]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:36.106]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[00:43:36.106 --> 00:43:38.488]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[00:43:39.048 --> 00:43:43.892]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[00:43:43.892 --> 00:43:45.433]  So this is a loss leader.
[00:43:45.433 --> 00:43:47.015]  We are losing money on this.
[00:43:47.015 --> 00:43:48.436]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:43:48.436 --> 00:43:51.779]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.
[00:43:51.779 --> 00:43:56.783]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:56.783 --> 00:43:59.205]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[00:43:59.205 --> 00:44:06.911]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:07.392]  It's you.
[00:44:08.482 --> 00:44:10.964]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:44:10.964 --> 00:44:12.205]  You are the InfoWarrant.
[00:44:12.205 --> 00:44:15.268]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:41.003]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:44:41.003 --> 00:44:48.965]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:44:48.965 --> 00:44:56.027]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:44:56.027 --> 00:44:58.768]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:06.679]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[00:45:06.679 --> 00:45:13.522]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[00:45:13.522 --> 00:45:29.048]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[00:45:30.191 --> 00:45:34.034]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[00:46:00.494 --> 00:46:08.381]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[00:46:08.381 --> 00:46:17.588]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[00:46:17.588 --> 00:46:25.275]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[00:46:25.435 --> 00:46:25.515]  Yeah.
[00:46:41.284 --> 00:46:43.786]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:17.473 --> 00:47:27.961]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:33.485]  So let me quantify what I've been talking about the last 47 minutes here on air on this Global Thursday Transmission.
[00:47:35.461 --> 00:47:42.971]  You don't want to have an army that comes right over the hill and attacks people because even if you take over their military, the people will have their own culture, their own identity.
[00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:44.453]  They're going to fight back.
[00:47:44.453 --> 00:47:47.117]  So first you attack people's culture and identity.
[00:47:47.117 --> 00:47:49.139]  You make people hate their families, hate their fathers.
[00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:52.981]  And rebel against them.
[00:47:52.981 --> 00:48:00.403]  And then you put things like hydrofluorosilicic acid, or weaponized sodium fluoride in the water that lowers IQ.
[00:48:00.403 --> 00:48:13.585]  But more importantly, acts as a sterilant and adjuvant that then accelerates, in many cases, other chemicals and other drugs being out of the water up to 100 plus times.
[00:48:13.585 --> 00:48:15.605]  So there's aluminum in a vaccine.
[00:48:15.605 --> 00:48:17.186]  It's an adjuvant.
[00:48:17.186 --> 00:48:19.586]  Or like nitrous oxide on a race car.
[00:48:20.782 --> 00:48:22.824]  You know, road warrior, humongous.
[00:48:22.824 --> 00:48:24.927]  Just give us the gas, we spare your lives.
[00:48:24.927 --> 00:48:30.413]  Driving that big tractor and he goes... That's what it does!
[00:48:30.413 --> 00:48:32.215]  Nitrous oxide!
[00:48:32.215 --> 00:48:34.237]  So, it's an accelerant.
[00:48:35.723 --> 00:48:42.487]  And it's in the White House Science Czar's own book he wrote in 74, Ecoscience, how they would do it to us, how they were already doing it.
[00:48:42.487 --> 00:48:45.149]  It's in Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.
[00:48:45.149 --> 00:48:54.695]  They got a Pulitzer Prize for it, how the Nazis were putting fluoride in the water to control their work camp people, how he learned it from Stalin.
[00:48:54.695 --> 00:48:58.257]  This is history, people.
[00:48:58.257 --> 00:49:00.598]  So now the fluoride's in the water.
[00:49:00.598 --> 00:49:01.779]  Now the families are getting broken up.
[00:49:03.112 --> 00:49:11.920]  Now they're adding chemicals in the environment that estrogenize women, give them cancer, make men feminine.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.283]  That's the effect.
[00:49:15.283 --> 00:49:17.725]  And then they've got to get down to killing people.
[00:49:17.725 --> 00:49:23.610]  So you dumb them down, you divide them, you make them stupid, you make them evil, you get rid of their attention span.
[00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:30.416]  Their number one thing is getting rid of the attention span, where people don't remember to carry out tasks, don't remember what happened before, don't follow through.
[00:49:32.228 --> 00:49:43.499]  So now that you've got a stunned... You know, there are a lot of eagles and owls that will grab turtles, that have got, you know, snapping turtles.
[00:49:43.499 --> 00:49:47.303]  And they'll take them up, they'll grab them, drop them on their head to what?
[00:49:47.303 --> 00:49:49.185]  Kill them or stun them?
[00:49:49.185 --> 00:49:56.572]  Spiders stun their prey and then tie them up, let them sangliate, let them get juicy, and then suck out the delicious nectar.
[00:49:58.072 --> 00:50:05.777]  And see, that's what's happening, is that we're stung and we're put into a low brainwave state.
[00:50:06.738 --> 00:50:19.763]  And then now, what's already been tested in the third world and things, now start giving them vaccines that we know statistically will brain damage a certain amount, will kill a certain amount, but you've got to have that because you want to further stun the general public.
[00:50:19.763 --> 00:50:33.188]  You're going to have higher numbers that die, higher numbers that convulse out, and you're going to practice managing the freak out and the convulsion and the death in the news, in the culture, so everybody just gets used to it.
[00:50:33.188 --> 00:50:33.949]  Like censorship.
[00:50:33.949 --> 00:50:34.629]  You ask, why do they
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:43.987]  Pick off one, and then pick off another, and pick off another, until you just get sick of hearing about it, and you adapt to being prey.
[00:50:43.987 --> 00:50:50.792]  You adapt and accept they're coming for you, and everyone else accepts it, and no one organizes to fight it.
[00:50:50.792 --> 00:50:52.674]  This is the program.
[00:50:52.674 --> 00:51:04.624]  But they've looked at the actuaries, and the algorithms, the number, and they knew that info wars had triggered human survival instincts on a global scale, because of you spreading the word, but because of my particular brand of truth,
[00:51:06.893 --> 00:51:17.535]  The titan-ish force, and that will to survive, that will to defeat the enemy, is strong.
[00:51:17.535 --> 00:51:25.637]  And they found us together, this operation, not just me, is able to break through the enemy like a battering ram, and we've blown major holes in their operations before.
[00:51:25.637 --> 00:51:28.438]  In fact, we've crippled them.
[00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:36.492]  And so they've desperately slammed on the accelerator, which is even more dangerous, because they've got to get their program finished before we fully wake up.
[00:51:36.492 --> 00:51:41.194]  So they're accelerating the death knell all over Europe, everywhere.
[00:51:41.194 --> 00:51:44.095]  That's why the left wants everyone banned from Facebook.
[00:51:44.095 --> 00:51:47.296]  They say, you can't let rural people or anyone on Facebook.
[00:51:47.296 --> 00:51:49.417]  They're going to get mad about vaccines killing them.
[00:51:49.417 --> 00:51:52.998]  They're going to get mad about all their pigs dying when they give them GMO corn.
[00:51:52.998 --> 00:51:54.119]  This is all being reported.
[00:51:54.119 --> 00:51:58.180]  They're going to get mad about, you know, a town of a thousand people having 10,000 Muslims brought in.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.621]  And the police say they're allowed to rape you.
[00:52:02.867 --> 00:52:05.768]  Hillary said, you're going too quickly.
[00:52:05.768 --> 00:52:09.508]  But the globalists, some globalists say, no, we've got to accelerate.
[00:52:09.508 --> 00:52:17.250]  So if you look at a radio dial, or let's talk about an audio dial, an old radio or an old TV, you know, it goes 1 to 10.
[00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:21.551]  So see, you've got to slowly turn that up like the frog in the pot.
[00:52:21.551 --> 00:52:27.612]  Just go to Google, type in radio dial or audio dial, or I'll look it up on my phone.
[00:52:28.444 --> 00:52:29.405]  I'll do that.
[00:52:29.405 --> 00:52:34.132]  So, and then they just slowly turn it up.
[00:52:34.132 --> 00:52:34.813]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[00:52:34.813 --> 00:52:40.160]  You know, it's killing you up there at 6.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.987]  It's absolutely, here I'll do it, it's absolutely killing you up there at 6, 7, 8.
[00:52:50.348 --> 00:52:51.690]  Let me search this myself.
[00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:52.410]  I'll get this done.
[00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:55.133]  It's no big deal.
[00:52:55.133 --> 00:52:56.754]  I'll go to the old evil Google.
[00:52:56.754 --> 00:52:59.978]  You know, they haven't censored yet being able to look up just regular things.
[00:52:59.978 --> 00:53:10.187]  It looks up audio, dial, D-I-L-E, boom, and hit images, and
[00:53:12.395 --> 00:53:13.656]  Wow, look at that.
[00:53:13.656 --> 00:53:15.237]  Things are so digitized now.
[00:53:15.237 --> 00:53:17.258]  The symbols, Dr. McKim, shot please.
[00:53:17.258 --> 00:53:19.840]  The symbols now aren't even old radio dials.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.061]  Just in 10 years, those are all phased out.
[00:53:22.061 --> 00:53:28.966]  That's why I said do the search earlier for vintage.
[00:53:28.966 --> 00:53:30.287]  Vintage audio dial, and look.
[00:53:31.138 --> 00:53:33.319]  There's a vintage audio dial, so there you go.
[00:53:33.319 --> 00:53:35.260]  Now we've got one for everybody.
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.861]  So you see, it wasn't that hard.
[00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:50.367]  You turn it up, it's ambient, until people get controlled and they get accustomed and they get used to more and more heat and they adapt to being put into this position and killed and destroyed.
[00:53:50.367 --> 00:53:54.549]  Their children dying, their neighbors dying, everyone getting cancer.
[00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:56.350]  But it's done incrementally.
[00:53:59.628 --> 00:54:02.489]  So the public begins to accept it.
[00:54:02.489 --> 00:54:14.852]  But the good news is there's now a congressperson in Tennessee that just got elected that's going to try to fulfill Trump's promise to investigate vaccines.
[00:54:14.852 --> 00:54:15.632]  Investigate.
[00:54:15.632 --> 00:54:20.413]  It's like at the hearings where the Republicans say, you need an internal investigation of how you're censoring.
[00:54:20.413 --> 00:54:28.155]  They had all the leadership at Google two years ago when Hillary lost on their own internal TV feed saying, we're going to really crush conservatives now.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:35.202]  To make sure our world government doesn't fail and Hillary gets elected next time.
[00:54:35.202 --> 00:54:37.442]  And why are all these congressmen and people going public?
[00:54:37.442 --> 00:54:43.204]  Because their grandkids and their kids take the shot and never talk again or die!
[00:54:43.204 --> 00:54:45.384]  Why does Trump say he doesn't like vaccines?
[00:54:45.384 --> 00:54:51.966]  Because Barron got one when he was 18 months old and had the damn convulsion and stopped talking for a year.
[00:54:51.966 --> 00:54:55.527]  And until recently, you could see him on television, you know, he's a little autistic.
[00:54:56.274 --> 00:55:01.017]  But he's a tough kid and got good genes, so he'll end up being exceptional still.
[00:55:01.017 --> 00:55:07.822]  But boy, did he take a big ol' lick upside the cerebral cortex!
[00:55:07.822 --> 00:55:22.192]  So, you're under attack, folks, and they're turning the heat up so the nurses and the doctors who aren't really in on it, but once they cover up a convulsion, once they cover up somebody dying, once they're involved, they go to the ethics board and they go, what do we do?
[00:55:22.192 --> 00:55:24.814]  And they say, it's true, vaccines are hurting people.
[00:55:26.403 --> 00:55:29.845]  They help so many others that it's a cost-benefit, but don't tell the public.
[00:55:29.845 --> 00:55:31.346]  They're too stupid.
[00:55:31.346 --> 00:55:32.827]  It's an appeal to elitism.
[00:55:32.827 --> 00:55:36.910]  I even had the head of the Texas Health Department division over that.
[00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:37.671]  I looked him up.
[00:55:37.671 --> 00:55:42.114]  He said, it's an off-record thing, Alex, but don't say my exact name, but you could talk about it.
[00:55:42.114 --> 00:55:43.635]  I was on the hike and bike trail about three years ago.
[00:55:43.635 --> 00:55:45.656]  And he goes, you're right.
[00:55:45.656 --> 00:55:48.538]  A lot of the vaccines are killing and hurting people, but we've got the numbers.
[00:55:48.538 --> 00:55:49.799]  Overall, they help more than they hurt.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.961]  And I said, well, hey, that's not true.
[00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:56.303]  And I went over that, talked to him like 10 minutes, and he started really kind of admitting, I guess you're right.
[00:55:56.303 --> 00:56:01.446]  And I said, and you're lying to people and telling them there's no problem because it's for their own good.
[00:56:01.446 --> 00:56:04.467]  Does that sound good to you?
[00:56:04.467 --> 00:56:07.849]  And the guy was pretty shaken because, you know, he was having guilt over it.
[00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:10.590]  So he thought he would tell me that it was for the greater good.
[00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:11.571]  Then I explained it wasn't.
[00:56:12.529 --> 00:56:18.090]  And I suppose there's larger programs adding things to them, and I gave him examples, and the guy was pretty damn shook up.
[00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:19.150]  I looked up his name.
[00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:29.633]  Soon as I got in the car, on the little smartphone that tracks me, and sure as hell, he was the head of the entire program for the state of Texas.
[00:56:29.633 --> 00:56:41.515]  And I looked at him, up at the top of the hill that we'd hiked up, and I said, this is gonna come back on you and your family.
[00:56:43.553 --> 00:56:44.914]  It's the way the universe works.
[00:56:44.914 --> 00:56:50.079]  And I said, you can rationalize this crap all day long.
[00:56:50.079 --> 00:56:54.984]  And I said, you don't look like an evil person, but you've been seduced into this, that you're part of the establishment.
[00:56:54.984 --> 00:56:55.564]  You know best.
[00:56:55.564 --> 00:56:59.007]  You sit around these committee rooms and you decide who lives and who dies.
[00:56:59.007 --> 00:57:06.354]  I said, just remember, there are committees above you that see you the same damn way.
[00:57:06.354 --> 00:57:08.196]  And I said, why don't you grow up and be a real man?
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.761]  And that guy started crying.
[00:57:13.761 --> 00:57:15.542]  I said, now you think about it.
[00:57:15.542 --> 00:57:17.283]  And I left.
[00:57:17.283 --> 00:57:20.664]  And that's my final message on this subject to everybody today.
[00:57:20.664 --> 00:57:22.925]  You better decide which side you're on, because this is going on.
[00:57:22.925 --> 00:57:24.766]  And everybody in their gut knows it.
[00:57:24.766 --> 00:57:26.427]  Everybody in their soul knows it.
[00:57:26.427 --> 00:57:28.308]  You can intellectually prove it all.
[00:57:28.308 --> 00:57:30.169]  Scientifically.
[00:57:30.169 --> 00:57:31.629]  So am I worried about getting killed myself?
[00:57:31.629 --> 00:57:32.950]  Am I worried about being taken off the earth?
[00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:33.070]  No.
[00:57:34.634 --> 00:57:39.783]  I'm worried about you not having the spirit to stand up against this and say no!
[00:57:39.783 --> 00:57:43.971]  We're really gonna let these mad scientists pull all this crap off on us?
[00:57:43.971 --> 00:57:45.353]  I say hell no!
[00:57:45.353 --> 00:57:47.276]  Humanity must awaken!
[00:57:49.409 --> 00:57:57.276]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[00:57:57.276 --> 00:58:06.505]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before, as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[00:58:06.505 --> 00:58:14.172]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[00:58:14.312 --> 00:58:14.632]  Now more
[00:58:29.977 --> 00:58:35.141]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[00:58:35.141 --> 00:58:36.442]  So I'll say it short and sweet.
[00:58:59.159 --> 00:59:01.500]  We need your support now, more than ever.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.362]  You've come through a thousand times, so I'm not bitching at you.
[00:59:04.362 --> 00:59:07.363]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[00:59:07.363 --> 00:59:13.006]  The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential, and down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[00:59:13.846 --> 00:59:26.270]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:28.191]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:33.893]  I need to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[00:59:33.893 --> 00:59:34.753]  But I need your prayers.
[00:59:34.753 --> 00:59:36.634]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[00:59:36.634 --> 00:59:38.595]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[00:59:38.595 --> 00:59:39.355]  We make it easy.
[00:59:39.915 --> 00:59:46.661]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the Globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon, and you'll help provision us.
[00:59:46.661 --> 00:59:53.328]  We've got a bunch of huge deals in fourstore.com, so please take action right now.
[00:59:53.328 --> 00:59:56.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.242 --> 01:00:14.049]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.049 --> 01:00:31.586]  It is a fact that the Chinese, that the Russians, that the European nations, the Germans particularly, the British, out of control.
[01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:38.232]  I've done massive, secret, lethal testing on men, women, and children.
[01:00:38.232 --> 01:00:39.713]  It's all declassified.
[01:00:39.713 --> 01:00:43.456]  Do you want me to list some of the more famous stuff?
[01:00:43.456 --> 01:00:45.197]  Everybody's heard about Tuskegee.
[01:00:45.197 --> 01:00:49.720]  Have you heard about nerve gassing British troops and thousands of tests that killed thousands?
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.543]  How about spraying Scottish and Irish towns with nerve gas or bioweapons?
[01:00:53.543 --> 01:00:54.824]  That's all declassified.
[01:00:54.824 --> 01:00:57.166]  How about taking
[01:00:59.977 --> 01:01:12.100]  Disabled children at the Department of Energy starting in the 50s, and putting them in radiation chambers, like something out of Wrath of Khan when Spock's in there, and frying them.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:22.603]  In some cases with such high radiation, the children's skin, they'd put them in there, would stick to the metal floor, frying them like eggs.
[01:01:23.982 --> 01:01:28.206]  Only the strongest scientists for the greater good can do it.
[01:01:28.206 --> 01:01:41.977]  Only, yes, they... And you know, the Japanese, in their secret test, going back to World War I, they would either use prisoners of war, because they were seen as men, so they could... they'd give it up, so they were dishonored, but they wouldn't test for the general public.
[01:01:41.977 --> 01:01:48.042]  They would have Japanese men in the warrior class volunteer to be tested on until they died.
[01:01:49.394 --> 01:01:51.676]  There was only one other group they could find that would do that in the U.S.
[01:01:51.676 --> 01:01:54.319]  That was the Seventh-Day Adventists.
[01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:57.902]  The Seventh-Day Adventists are some really tough hombres.
[01:01:57.902 --> 01:02:05.489]  Thousands of them, in declassified documents, submitted to lethal testing with chemicals, biologicals, and radiologicals.
[01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:12.755]  They literally allowed themselves to be killed, they believe, for the greater Christian faith.
[01:02:13.695 --> 01:02:15.657]  I said that was being manipulated and twisted.
[01:02:15.657 --> 01:02:20.020]  But that's why the Seventh-Day Adventists were very important for secret operations and things.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:30.267]  Because if you're willing to die in radiation or biological or chemical tests, well, you're going to be the person we send on missions to kill people to.
[01:02:30.267 --> 01:02:38.033]  And just so happens, my mother worked for some certain people up in Dallas.
[01:02:38.033 --> 01:02:40.695]  And when I was a little kid, when I was a baby,
[01:02:42.205 --> 01:02:43.486]  She was pregnant, actually.
[01:02:43.486 --> 01:02:50.789]  Richard Nixon would call up on the telephone, and she'd give the phone to the Seventh-day Adventist gentleman.
[01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:54.490]  And so, and I'm not Seventh-day Adventist, they just like my parents.
[01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:57.191]  I have no idea why they were working there.
[01:02:57.191 --> 01:03:07.896]  The point is, is that this is the type of stuff that's going on, and the public are a bunch of naive people if they don't grow up now!
[01:03:07.896 --> 01:03:08.256]  Stop it!
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.141]  Stop being naive!
[01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:14.643]  This project needs to end, and Trump's damn well trying to end it.
[01:03:14.643 --> 01:03:18.365]  That's why they're so pissed!
[01:03:18.365 --> 01:03:20.466]  Let me tell you all this MKUltra crap.
[01:03:20.466 --> 01:03:30.391]  At the end of the day, it's about getting a bunch of people involved in criminal stuff so the pedophiles can compromise them and get away with screwing and killing kids.
[01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:34.053]  You know, what did I say five years ago when they said we're gonna have
[01:03:37.043 --> 01:03:38.044]  Gay scout leaders.
[01:03:38.044 --> 01:03:41.866]  I'm not against men that like men or vice versa.
[01:03:41.866 --> 01:03:50.751]  But when you want to put someone who's into sex and makes it a point in with a bunch of young men or boys, you're going to have sexual abuse just like the Catholic Church.
[01:03:50.751 --> 01:03:55.414]  Oh, and now the Boy Scouts of America is set to go bankrupt because of all the lawsuits.
[01:03:55.414 --> 01:04:02.879]  What do you think you do at the World Jamboree where they handed out condoms to young boys as young as seven with groups of men?
[01:04:04.175 --> 01:04:12.901]  That would be freaking gross if I showed up as an adult at some resort and there were 10,000 people and they were handing out condoms to everybody.
[01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:14.822]  I'd be like, I don't want to get diseases.
[01:04:14.822 --> 01:04:15.642]  What the hell is this?
[01:04:15.642 --> 01:04:21.986]  It would just sound, you know, it's like going to somebody's house in Hollywood and they got 20 hookers there and it's kind of obscene.
[01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:25.249]  You're like, it's like these women are bowls of peanuts or something.
[01:04:25.249 --> 01:04:27.530]  I'm getting out of here.
[01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:30.292]  But imagine you show up and little kids are like bowls of peanuts.
[01:04:34.324 --> 01:04:36.985]  Plain old bowls of nuts and potato chips.
[01:04:36.985 --> 01:04:37.965]  Just, hey, you want this one?
[01:04:37.965 --> 01:04:39.485]  You want that one?
[01:04:39.485 --> 01:04:41.726]  I didn't do that.
[01:04:41.726 --> 01:04:43.507]  Imagine little kids.
[01:04:43.507 --> 01:04:44.947]  They'd say, oh, this is what we do.
[01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:48.148]  We're just going to screw these little kids.
[01:04:48.148 --> 01:04:50.789]  And then we're going to blow up the Boy Scouts of America.
[01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:53.829]  And we all let everybody do it, because we don't want to be homophobic.
[01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:54.650]  So come on in here.
[01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:55.890]  Screw my kid in the ass.
[01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:56.430]  It's all right.
[01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:58.531]  It's liberal.
[01:04:58.531 --> 01:05:01.591]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents knew that they canned food.
[01:05:01.591 --> 01:05:03.152]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.521 --> 01:05:07.462]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[01:05:07.462 --> 01:05:11.523]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.
[01:05:11.523 --> 01:05:14.463]  One of the top, most respected companies out there.
[01:05:14.463 --> 01:05:22.225]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:22.225 --> 01:05:27.587]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:05:27.587 --> 01:05:29.867]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:05:29.867 --> 01:05:32.988]  MFootwearStore.com on MFootwear Select storable foods.
[01:05:33.368 --> 01:05:34.849]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:38.591]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:05:38.591 --> 01:05:41.052]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:41.052 --> 01:05:42.613]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:05:42.613 --> 01:05:44.594]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.594 --> 01:05:47.135]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:47.135 --> 01:05:52.118]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.118 --> 01:05:57.501]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:06:06.437 --> 01:06:21.571]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:06:21.571 --> 01:06:24.333]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:31.305 --> 01:06:35.926]  When you look at some of these groups, these are violent people.
[01:06:35.926 --> 01:06:37.586]  We'll have a little bit more here in a second.
[01:06:37.586 --> 01:06:39.487]  Michael, you know where he's trafficking.
[01:06:39.487 --> 01:06:42.407]  He's trafficking in this part of the Republican base.
[01:06:42.407 --> 01:06:44.828]  It's not fair to call it the Republican base, although that's what it is now.
[01:06:44.828 --> 01:06:52.249]  But I think, in fairness to you, from both the Trump voters, he's trafficking in their conspiracies.
[01:06:52.249 --> 01:06:52.590]  Yeah.
[01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:54.050]  And he touched Antifa.
[01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:56.972]  An issue in Portland, Oregon.
[01:06:56.972 --> 01:06:59.633]  Okay, I will grant you that.
[01:06:59.633 --> 01:07:01.414]  But this is not a giant issue.
[01:07:01.414 --> 01:07:04.717]  This reminds me a lot of his initial reaction to Charlottesville.
[01:07:04.717 --> 01:07:11.621]  This desire to talk about violence on the left as somehow equal to or perhaps greater than violence on the right.
[01:07:11.621 --> 01:07:13.803]  Or to rationalize violence!
[01:07:13.803 --> 01:07:15.644]  I think he just wants to rationalize violence.
[01:07:20.376 --> 01:07:24.399]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the n-word?
[01:07:24.399 --> 01:07:29.603]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[01:07:29.603 --> 01:07:32.946]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[01:07:32.946 --> 01:07:37.389]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[01:07:37.389 --> 01:07:38.730]  I wouldn't support that group.
[01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:39.050]  Would you?
[01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:46.156]  This has been a public service announcement from InfoWars.com Antifa!
[01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:17.749]  Holding up our OK to be white signs.
[01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:23.591]  You know, I think it's OK to be white, it's OK to be black, it's awesome to be human, isn't it Gavin McInnes?
[01:08:23.591 --> 01:08:27.292]  I don't know about this day and age, things are changing.
[01:08:27.292 --> 01:08:32.514]  I'm at the point now where I think it's not OK to be white, it's not OK to support Trump, it's not OK to be American.
[01:08:32.514 --> 01:08:33.394]  I think we lost.
[01:08:35.026 --> 01:08:38.228]  And by the way, it's a bunch of white liberals creating the race war.
[01:08:38.228 --> 01:08:40.450]  All the quote minorities I know aren't even into this crap.
[01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:51.477]  Oh, you talk to black people and they don't know, they're not familiar with all of these isms and intersectionality and that sign and all this crap.
[01:08:51.477 --> 01:08:55.379]  It's a purely upper elite white liberal thing.
[01:08:55.379 --> 01:08:57.020]  Trying to divide and conquer us.
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.861]  Ann Coulter will play this clip.
[01:08:58.861 --> 01:09:00.803]  We've got a bunch of these clips, we'll get to it in a few minutes.
[01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.264]  Ann Coulter has come out and said,
[01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:10.086]  And she lists the New York Times board members saying whites are subhuman goblins that live in holes, should be exterminated.
[01:09:10.086 --> 01:09:14.428]  She lists all these other shows saying whites are inherently evil, that being white is bad, that white men are the problem.
[01:09:14.428 --> 01:09:19.230]  They've all said it on these channels, white, black, Hispanic commentators trying to create race war.
[01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:25.574]  And then Ann Coulter says, you hate white people, and they call for her to be taken off Fox as a commentator, saying she's a racist.
[01:09:25.574 --> 01:09:31.317]  So they're all saying whites are inherently evil, but then if you say that's racist, then you're bad.
[01:09:32.185 --> 01:09:34.347]  I'm just so sick of talking about it, too.
[01:09:34.347 --> 01:09:40.132]  Like, when you talk to your friends and stuff, you talk about the economy, you talk about jobs.
[01:09:40.132 --> 01:09:40.773]  What's fun.
[01:09:40.773 --> 01:09:41.854]  You talk about what's fun.
[01:09:41.854 --> 01:09:46.898]  Real estate, girls, ACDC, are all those songs the same?
[01:09:46.898 --> 01:09:48.359]  Were they the first punk band?
[01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:50.161]  No, they're all the same, but they're all good.
[01:09:50.161 --> 01:09:50.581]  Exactly.
[01:09:50.581 --> 01:09:51.522]  They got the formula.
[01:09:51.522 --> 01:09:52.083]  Like the Ramones.
[01:09:53.044 --> 01:10:00.939]  And then you tune in to the elite liberal class at the New York Times, and it's race city, race, race, race, and it's just exhausting!
[01:10:00.939 --> 01:10:02.322]  It's not normal!
[01:10:02.322 --> 01:10:03.384]  I never thought about...
[01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:07.635]  What color people were until the last few years and now it's just everywhere.
[01:10:07.635 --> 01:10:10.297]  America is not racist.
[01:10:10.297 --> 01:10:10.798]  Stop it.
[01:10:10.798 --> 01:10:14.701]  These hate has no home here signs are driving me insane.
[01:10:14.701 --> 01:10:18.325]  You might as well have a sign in your yard that says rape has no home here.
[01:10:18.325 --> 01:10:20.727]  Yeah, I know hate has no home here.
[01:10:20.727 --> 01:10:23.310]  You go to a bar, you walk, oh, the South is evil.
[01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:25.652]  You walk around the South and you see a bunch of people.
[01:10:25.652 --> 01:10:26.773]  There's a black guy in line.
[01:10:26.773 --> 01:10:27.294]  How you doing?
[01:10:27.294 --> 01:10:27.914]  Oh, hey, Daryl.
[01:10:27.914 --> 01:10:28.375]  How's your mom?
[01:10:28.855 --> 01:10:34.524]  And then you go to the New York Times and it's like, oh, the white people are being burned.
[01:10:34.524 --> 01:10:41.115]  And literally every one of the cross burnings or poop swastikas or things at the military academies is staged by the left.
[01:10:41.115 --> 01:10:42.597]  Every one of them staged.
[01:10:42.597 --> 01:10:43.398]  It's become this.
[01:10:43.959 --> 01:10:46.279]  Paranoia, this manic obsession.
[01:10:46.279 --> 01:10:52.540]  Remember that girl who called the police because she saw there was a Klan rally going on in her college?
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.181]  And the college goes, what?
[01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:56.141]  We don't remember renting out the room.
[01:10:56.141 --> 01:11:01.622]  It was a dust jacket on a microscope that had a pointy top because that's how dust jackets work.
[01:11:01.622 --> 01:11:09.403]  Oh, it's like saying it's like up in Omaha, Nebraska, of all places, the principal says, listen, candy canes are J's for Jesus.
[01:11:09.403 --> 01:11:11.704]  They're banned and red and green.
[01:11:11.704 --> 01:11:12.884]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:11:14.468 --> 01:11:16.008]  Remember the Hitler teapot?
[01:11:16.008 --> 01:11:16.389]  J.C.
[01:11:16.389 --> 01:11:30.273]  Penney has a teapot that has a normal handle, but then it did a reflection that maybe somebody would see Hitler, if you're mentally ill obsessed with Hitler, and they said, you're right, we're getting rid of that teapot.
[01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:32.415]  I call them not-see glasses.
[01:11:32.415 --> 01:11:33.475]  Not-see glasses.
[01:11:33.475 --> 01:11:37.459]  Because we would do this thing on my old show where we'd come up with anything.
[01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:40.081]  Socks, mustaches, licorice.
[01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:46.205]  No matter what we came up with, we could find someone saying it was racist.
[01:11:46.205 --> 01:11:46.646]  No matter what.
[01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.958]  Gavin McGinnis is here with us in the studio.
[01:11:49.958 --> 01:11:52.039]  We'll obviously get into your massive de-platforming.
[01:11:52.039 --> 01:11:55.761]  You're now joining the elite club of SuperDangerous, The Establishment.
[01:11:55.761 --> 01:12:05.486]  We'll talk about why in the next segment, but let's talk about, because it's something you never do, where people can still find you because they love you and you're super, even bigger, like supernova.
[01:12:05.486 --> 01:12:12.190]  The sun blows up, it's really big for a while, but we need to get everybody to understand, like I told you, you should be trying to get your fans and listeners to
[01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:21.367]  Send you their email and newsletter so that no matter what, at least for now, you can still get to them because we're moving towards them banning URLs next.
[01:12:21.367 --> 01:12:23.150]  Oh yeah, well banks are coming next.
[01:12:26.382 --> 01:12:36.590]  There's lots of people on the SPLC's hate list, and the hate list for the SPLC of course includes anyone who's Christian, who's against gay adoption, who is... anyone basically right-wing is on that list.
[01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:39.572]  And banks will then get pressured from the SPLC and the ADL.
[01:12:39.572 --> 01:12:51.341]  Oh, the new thing is if you don't let Nambla into your school, posing as the quote, drag queen club, a huge fat guy with a wig on, and don't let them talk to your five-year-old about their ding-dong, if you don't let them do that, then you're a hate group.
[01:12:51.341 --> 01:12:51.522]  Yes.
[01:12:52.302 --> 01:12:57.967]  And by the way, we've had not a lot of stations but some complain and say, Alex, please don't talk about it.
[01:12:57.967 --> 01:12:59.148]  I didn't used to do this.
[01:12:59.148 --> 01:13:01.790]  They're teaching 5 year olds and 2 year olds this.
[01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:04.592]  I have to tell you what they're doing.
[01:13:04.592 --> 01:13:11.998]  I can't even show video we shot at public events in Austin with men out in the public with glitter on their genitals.
[01:13:12.438 --> 01:13:12.899]  Oh, I remember that.
[01:13:12.899 --> 01:13:13.699]  And the guy should be in porn.
[01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:15.121]  He looks like an elephant trunk.
[01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:17.543]  He's got... We can't even show it because stations get mad.
[01:13:17.543 --> 01:13:20.666]  And they've got two-year-old kids hugging a guy naked!
[01:13:20.666 --> 01:13:22.188]  But I can't show the video!
[01:13:22.188 --> 01:13:22.968]  I'm the bad guy!
[01:13:22.968 --> 01:13:24.310]  This is unbelievable!
[01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:34.438]  You know, in Pat Buchanan's book, Death of the West, he talks about the Frankfurt School, and he says that what they do is they call you racist.
[01:13:34.438 --> 01:13:47.410]  If an opponent becomes too much of a hindrance, then just call them Nazi and racist again and again and again, and then they spend their time defending that, and they lose their power.
[01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:48.051]  They change the subject!
[01:13:48.611 --> 01:13:52.573]  And we're just busy, hey, go ahead, have sex with our kids, don't call us racist!
[01:13:52.573 --> 01:13:53.613]  I'm not racist.
[01:13:53.613 --> 01:13:54.353]  And it worked.
[01:13:54.353 --> 01:13:56.694]  I mean, you say, where can people find me?
[01:13:56.694 --> 01:13:57.515]  Nowhere.
[01:13:57.515 --> 01:13:58.455]  I'm done.
[01:13:58.455 --> 01:14:01.196]  I mean, I've heard them back on YouTube, that's not gonna last.
[01:14:01.196 --> 01:14:03.257]  But I got kicked off of every platform.
[01:14:03.257 --> 01:14:10.700]  And now, they can do this, they can take this narrative and just make me whoever they want, and I can't defend myself.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.642]  So, they de-platform you, they dehumanize you, and then...
[01:14:15.362 --> 01:14:17.863]  Well, they don't even have to kill you because you don't exist.
[01:14:17.863 --> 01:14:19.023]  I don't exist anymore.
[01:14:19.023 --> 01:14:22.784]  I've been erased.
[01:14:22.784 --> 01:14:26.885]  And once you're erased, they can make up whatever they want.
[01:14:26.885 --> 01:14:27.985]  They want us dead.
[01:14:27.985 --> 01:14:30.926]  I mean, if Ann Coulter was killed... But that's the worst part.
[01:14:30.926 --> 01:14:32.547]  They don't just shut you down.
[01:14:32.547 --> 01:14:34.407]  Then they really start lying.
[01:14:34.407 --> 01:14:34.627]  Yeah.
[01:14:34.627 --> 01:14:37.008]  You're, like, tied up in the ring and they're, like, punching you and it's...
[01:14:38.249 --> 01:14:41.411]  Here's another trick that the left does.
[01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:42.731]  They threaten your family, right?
[01:14:42.731 --> 01:14:45.633]  So you don't want to ever put pictures of your kids up.
[01:14:45.633 --> 01:14:49.174]  So you look at someone like Chris Hayes, Mark Ruffalo, all these other activists.
[01:14:49.174 --> 01:14:51.035]  They're in pictures with their kids.
[01:14:51.035 --> 01:14:52.296]  And you go, oh, that's a human.
[01:14:52.296 --> 01:14:53.376]  That's a dad.
[01:14:53.376 --> 01:14:54.837]  That's a wonderful family person.
[01:14:54.837 --> 01:14:57.698]  But then with you... We can't show our family because they'll use it.
[01:14:57.698 --> 01:14:58.238]  They'll laugh at them.
[01:14:58.238 --> 01:15:00.860]  And then just use a picture where you're scowling like this.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.241]  And then you can make him more and more the villain.
[01:15:03.241 --> 01:15:04.722]  Dehumanize him more and more.
[01:15:05.842 --> 01:15:08.003]  He can die, he can vanish.
[01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:11.764]  I didn't get rid of a person's voice, I got rid of Hitler.
[01:15:11.764 --> 01:15:17.506]  And I know we talked about this in private, and then I kind of advised not to give him attention, but maybe we should.
[01:15:17.506 --> 01:15:25.209]  Because the same guy that literally edited in audio Mike Cernovich torturing his baby daughter, which he didn't do, that's a criminal offense.
[01:15:25.209 --> 01:15:29.471]  I mean, that's not just doxing, that's where you call the police on somebody with a false report.
[01:15:31.211 --> 01:15:31.811]  What do they call it?
[01:15:31.811 --> 01:15:32.732]  Swatting.
[01:15:32.732 --> 01:15:33.373]  Right.
[01:15:33.373 --> 01:15:38.578]  So they try to swat him, the same guy put out fake edited videos of you, and they're praised by the left.
[01:15:38.578 --> 01:15:39.920]  I mean, that's what they do to me.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.044]  They edit these videos out of context, or audio, and then they do this.
[01:15:44.044 --> 01:15:46.086]  So, Gavin McInnes is our guest.
[01:15:46.086 --> 01:15:48.608]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:15:48.608 --> 01:15:50.270]  You don't have a website?
[01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:51.631]  Nope.

[01:15:53.693 --> 01:15:54.274]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:58.920]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:04.304]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.304 --> 01:16:07.206]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.206 --> 01:16:10.789]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:17:27.128 --> 01:17:28.369]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.369 --> 01:17:32.292]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.292 --> 01:17:33.813]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:33.813 --> 01:17:36.775]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.775 --> 01:17:42.338]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.338 --> 01:17:43.539]  I can help you, too.

[01:18:58.072 --> 01:19:07.359]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.359 --> 01:19:10.241]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.241 --> 01:19:16.286]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:16.946 --> 01:19:23.211]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.211 --> 01:19:29.497]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.497 --> 01:19:36.442]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:39.185]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:15.136]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:15.136 --> 01:20:21.679]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:21.679 --> 01:20:28.943]  Alright, Gavin is really freaked out, Gavin McGinnis.
[01:20:28.943 --> 01:20:31.684]  And he wants to talk about Proud Boys and what he was told to do.
[01:20:31.684 --> 01:20:34.986]  You're gonna get the big inside baseball.
[01:20:34.986 --> 01:20:35.386]  New York
[01:20:36.678 --> 01:20:40.279]  If you know, a month ago, all these, they're having an event.
[01:20:40.279 --> 01:20:43.399]  Antifa shows up with metal clubs, you name it, to attack them.
[01:20:43.399 --> 01:20:44.299]  They attack.
[01:20:44.299 --> 01:20:45.219]  Proud Boys fight back.
[01:20:45.219 --> 01:20:47.040]  It's all on video.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:58.902]  The police indict them, trying to put them in prison, and they tell them, the prosecutors, and you just told me we could talk about this, say you disavow Proud Boys, say all this, and we will drop, you know, we'll go light on them.
[01:20:58.902 --> 01:21:01.642]  Well, now they're sentencing us today, and now they've backed off on that.
[01:21:01.642 --> 01:21:02.522]  That's how it works.
[01:21:02.522 --> 01:21:03.463]  It's how the FBI works.
[01:21:03.463 --> 01:21:05.523]  It's how the Democrats work.
[01:21:05.523 --> 01:21:05.883]  And so,
[01:21:07.915 --> 01:21:11.516]  They get you to disavow, and that's meant to make it sound like you don't like Proud Boys.
[01:21:11.516 --> 01:21:17.398]  At the same time, they have the FBI with no proof, and it turns out they didn't say it, say that they're an extremist group.
[01:21:17.398 --> 01:21:18.999]  And it turns out that didn't happen.
[01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:23.300]  And so this is all a giant setup to discredit Proud Boys.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:23.621]  Why?
[01:21:23.621 --> 01:21:27.022]  So before we go there, tell them what Proud Boys is, what Antifa is.
[01:21:27.822 --> 01:21:29.184]  Why they're so angry at you?
[01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:34.171]  They admit that Antifa is the paramilitary of the left to go out and intimidate people.
[01:21:34.171 --> 01:21:35.533]  The mayor is horrible in Portland.
[01:21:35.533 --> 01:21:37.276]  Anybody that tries to protest him has their head beat in.
[01:21:37.276 --> 01:21:38.537]  The police let them do it.
[01:21:38.537 --> 01:21:40.340]  I mean, you talk about a civil rights violation.
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:41.802]  Gavin McInnes, get into this.
[01:21:42.739 --> 01:21:46.582]  Okay, the Proud Boys are a group like the Elks Lodge that just drink beer.
[01:21:46.582 --> 01:21:47.963]  That's 99% of what they do.
[01:21:47.963 --> 01:21:52.207]  They love Trump and these clubs used to be everywhere.
[01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:53.848]  Then we started getting attacked.
[01:21:53.848 --> 01:21:55.549]  I got pepper sprayed at NYU.
[01:21:55.549 --> 01:22:02.114]  Lawrence Southern had urine covered in piss, excuse my language, twice.
[01:22:02.114 --> 01:22:02.535]  Twice!
[01:22:02.535 --> 01:22:03.375]  I've had them throw it on me.
[01:22:04.316 --> 01:22:06.517]  They throw feces at us, batteries.
[01:22:06.517 --> 01:22:07.978]  Feces, urine, it's mixed together.
[01:22:07.978 --> 01:22:17.404]  Yes, I just saw, I was just in Britain with Tommy Robinson and they were throwing feces, like from their own, like the supporters were there and Antifa were in the back, whatever you want to call them.
[01:22:17.404 --> 01:22:19.505]  But anyway, so totally under attacks.
[01:22:19.505 --> 01:22:21.887]  Joey Gibson can't walk down Portland.
[01:22:21.887 --> 01:22:28.551]  So they started going to these events and saying, well just surround them and be like bodyguards, like the guardian angels kind of thing.
[01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:30.332]  Now they're always disarmed.
[01:22:30.332 --> 01:22:31.373]  This is what no one gets.
[01:22:31.373 --> 01:22:35.077]  They're always disarmed because they go through the police barrier to be with the speaker.
[01:22:35.077 --> 01:22:36.498]  And they walk into a trap.
[01:22:36.498 --> 01:22:37.159]  Real heroes.
[01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:38.480]  The police will disarm you.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.563]  But then when they leave, they're going out of the police perimeter.
[01:22:41.563 --> 01:22:43.205]  And they're now totally disarmed.
[01:22:43.205 --> 01:22:46.768]  And they're getting beaten with those collapsible batons like Rufio was.
[01:22:46.768 --> 01:22:48.310]  And so they fight back.
[01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:50.132]  Show Rufio when they try to hit him with metal batons.
[01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:51.113]  And show Antifa violence.
[01:22:51.113 --> 01:22:51.313]  Go ahead.
[01:22:52.961 --> 01:22:53.681]  Keep going.
[01:22:53.681 --> 01:22:55.982]  Okay, so you get someone like Beck.
[01:22:55.982 --> 01:23:00.483]  Glenn Beck says to me, you know, you got to go the Martin Luther King route and you got to get away from this violence.
[01:23:00.483 --> 01:23:02.563]  What was Rufio supposed to do in that scenario?
[01:23:02.563 --> 01:23:06.064]  A guy comes at him with a metal baton listed as a death weapon.
[01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:06.824]  As a deadly weapon.
[01:23:06.824 --> 01:23:09.025]  Those things will open up your face.
[01:23:09.025 --> 01:23:11.986]  They'll do permanent damage to you.
[01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:12.666]  They could kill you.
[01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:13.826]  It's more dangerous than a bull whip.
[01:23:13.826 --> 01:23:15.787]  So yeah, and this isn't like the Freedom Riders.
[01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:19.508]  So the guy comes at you with a steel baton, a murder weapon.
[01:23:19.508 --> 01:23:20.108]  Tell me what to do.
[01:23:20.108 --> 01:23:21.128]  You're supposed to murder me!
[01:23:21.828 --> 01:23:22.469]  No, no, no.
[01:23:22.469 --> 01:23:24.030]  You defend yourself, you're a bad guy.
[01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:26.472]  Yeah, Joey Gibson, I love him, and he says the same thing.
[01:23:26.472 --> 01:23:27.833]  He goes, no, you've just got to take the beating.
[01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:30.215]  And I go, but that could be fatal.
[01:23:30.215 --> 01:23:31.936]  You look at the weapons that were confiscated in Portland.
[01:23:31.936 --> 01:23:34.898]  But that's why it's essential that we don't even call it Proud Boys.
[01:23:34.898 --> 01:23:43.725]  Men need to go to every gun rally, land rights rally, anti-globalist rally, and just have a right under law to defend and stand against these guys.
[01:23:43.725 --> 01:23:51.271]  So the reason you're bad is you rallied a bunch of men to just simply stand up to these guys, and they got their ass kicked, and they're a bunch of meth-head professors, and they're
[01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:55.773]  And by the way, these guys, Proud Boys, never go to Antifa events.
[01:23:55.773 --> 01:23:57.194]  They don't pick fights.
[01:23:57.194 --> 01:24:00.535]  They just defend conservatives, Trump supporters.
[01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:01.736]  They're not even that conservative.
[01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:05.698]  It's just like England, Canada, and liberal cities.
[01:24:05.698 --> 01:24:11.881]  You'll hear about a mugger raping a guy's daughter and the father attacks the rapist and he goes to jail.
[01:24:12.998 --> 01:24:14.179]  That's a big fear of mine, too.
[01:24:14.179 --> 01:24:16.700]  And you know what's crazy in all of this?
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.802]  Antifa are kind of victims, in a sense.
[01:24:19.802 --> 01:24:20.563]  Hear me out.
[01:24:20.563 --> 01:24:22.824]  Like that guy we were talking about who edits the videos?
[01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:26.947]  He doxxed Cernovich's event, Night for Freedom, right?
[01:24:26.947 --> 01:24:32.310]  And Antifa shows up, starts attacking, they're calling for our children and stuff, and murder, and they want to kill Mike's kids.
[01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.991]  Crazy crap.
[01:24:33.631 --> 01:24:37.596]  And this old Jewish guy is leaving and the police go, you should probably go in a taxi, sir.
[01:24:37.596 --> 01:24:38.337]  And he goes, what?
[01:24:38.337 --> 01:24:40.119]  No, this is America.
[01:24:40.119 --> 01:24:41.020]  I'm not a pedophile.
[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:42.882]  I don't need to be escorted out.
[01:24:42.882 --> 01:24:46.086]  So he walks out and gets jumped by Antifa.
[01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:47.868]  They start choking him, punch him.
[01:24:47.868 --> 01:24:49.069]  He has a heart attack.
[01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:51.671]  And he's whisked away to the hospital.
[01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:53.173]  Then the cops grab this Antifa kid.
[01:24:53.173 --> 01:24:55.894]  His name, I think, is David Campbell.
[01:24:55.894 --> 01:24:58.556]  And he starts fighting the cops.
[01:24:58.556 --> 01:25:00.298]  He's looking at 15 years.
[01:25:00.298 --> 01:25:11.846]  And in his crazy brain, he'd been brainwashed by all these lunatics on the left into thinking that he was genuinely, you know, killing... Remember how Hillary's running mate, Senator Kaine's son, was organizing this stuff.
[01:25:11.846 --> 01:25:12.666]  Yep.
[01:25:12.666 --> 01:25:15.108]  And Tim Kaine said, we need to take these fights to the streets.
[01:25:15.108 --> 01:25:17.670]  So this lie about Nazis being everywhere...
[01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:25.310]  Yeah, no, you send your jerk kids out here to beat up women and children, a few men show up and kick your ass when you attack them, and then they're the bad guys.
[01:25:26.215 --> 01:25:30.558]  And so, bottom line, you didn't throw problems on the bus.
[01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:36.143]  When they got set up for defending themselves, you were told, do this, we won't put them in prison, and of course you wouldn't.
[01:25:36.143 --> 01:25:41.747]  No, they said that the push for the prosecution is going to be that it's a gang, and that gangs are two things.
[01:25:41.747 --> 01:25:43.829]  They do illegal activities, and they have a leader.
[01:25:43.829 --> 01:25:49.433]  So get rid of the leader, and we're helping get rid of this lie that they're a gang, and it won't drop the charges.
[01:25:49.673 --> 01:25:50.334]  But it might leave it.
[01:25:50.334 --> 01:25:52.335]  They're looking at felony riot.
[01:25:52.335 --> 01:25:53.877]  And here's the crazy part.
[01:25:53.877 --> 01:26:00.263]  Every time I talk to cops about this, they go, I don't know who you pissed off, but something crazy is going on.
[01:26:00.263 --> 01:26:03.446]  Because, because, because, exactly that night, it's not what's just on camera.
[01:26:03.446 --> 01:26:04.807]  Tell folks the rest of the story.
[01:26:04.807 --> 01:26:07.910]  When the cops, because the cops are there for your event, they stand by and watch this.
[01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:14.176]  And then when they arrest your guys and protect Antifa, they're going, F you pig, F you scum, hope you die.
[01:26:14.176 --> 01:26:22.584]  Okay, to be clear, they were attacking the venue five days before the venue had me.
[01:26:22.584 --> 01:26:23.865]  It's like knocking windows out
[01:26:24.125 --> 01:26:29.348]  Calling the poor old lady who works there, saying things I can't say on the air about what they're going to do to her.
[01:26:29.348 --> 01:26:31.809]  Calls coming from all over the country, by the way.
[01:26:31.809 --> 01:26:34.130]  Why do you care about a Manhattan club?
[01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:35.551]  It was this joke.
[01:26:35.551 --> 01:26:36.751]  Because they want to silence you.
[01:26:36.751 --> 01:26:37.712]  Then they vandalize the club.
[01:26:37.712 --> 01:26:39.052]  They say this is just the beginning.
[01:26:39.052 --> 01:26:42.074]  Then they show up and their signs were too nice.
[01:26:42.074 --> 01:26:44.835]  There's guys in the crowd who don't look like they have any idea who I am.
[01:26:44.835 --> 01:26:46.356]  They look like they were paid protesters.
[01:26:46.836 --> 01:26:51.223]  The signs, one was embroidered, and it looked like a $3,000 cloth sign.
[01:26:51.223 --> 01:26:52.885]  That was very suspicious.
[01:26:52.885 --> 01:26:53.807]  It was not organic.
[01:26:53.807 --> 01:26:55.049]  Anyway, there they're attacking people.
[01:26:55.049 --> 01:27:01.118]  They attack one reporter, beat him up, take his equipment, and for that, three people were charged, right?
[01:27:02.479 --> 01:27:02.619]  That's
[01:27:21.144 --> 01:27:23.507]  Take these Proud Boys, about 20 Proud Boys.
[01:27:23.507 --> 01:27:26.189]  I leave separately, as they throw urine at my car.
[01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:28.191]  And I go, Otoya Yamaguchi!
[01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:32.676]  And I wave this plastic sword that everyone makes it look so sinister.
[01:27:32.676 --> 01:27:34.718]  It's a broken plastic kid's toy.
[01:27:34.718 --> 01:27:37.341]  Anyway, they escort 20 Proud Boys to the train.
[01:27:38.462 --> 01:27:39.923]  Antifa had been dispersed.
[01:27:39.923 --> 01:27:46.489]  They went around the block, came back, ambushed these guys, threw pee at them again, right?
[01:27:46.489 --> 01:27:47.770]  And starts winning.
[01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:50.152]  They actually was kicking them when they're down, if you watch the video.
[01:27:50.152 --> 01:27:54.757]  And then the Proud Boys fight back, and the cops go, are you okay to Antifa?
[01:27:54.757 --> 01:27:55.878]  Do you want to press charges?
[01:27:55.878 --> 01:27:57.039]  And they say, F you, pig.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:06.062]  The way the law works is if you come up to a fight and both guys say, it's okay, officer, then the officer walks away.
[01:28:06.062 --> 01:28:07.782]  You need a victim for assault.
[01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:10.983]  You need a dead body for murder.
[01:28:10.983 --> 01:28:11.903]  We've all seen the video.
[01:28:11.903 --> 01:28:15.724]  Let's show the video again where Antifa, I mean, go back to the night of the event.
[01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:17.524]  What should they type in to get that video up?
[01:28:17.524 --> 01:28:28.107]  And Antifa, all these meth head looking guys that have thighs that are like an inch around, like they're insects, come marching up to huge dudes, throwing bottles at them, kicking people, and then they get their ass kicked.
[01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:33.208]  And then they wonder why, I mean, let me tell you, I'm not the toughest guy around.
[01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:39.250]  I mean, it's not, I've only beat to death a couple people, but the point is, these guys, I can literally take on ten of them.
[01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:44.752]  And the thing is, you pull out a metal baton on me, that's when, that's when I actually flip out and become dangerous.
[01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:45.092]  Yeah.
[01:28:45.092 --> 01:28:45.952]  That's what my brain is.
[01:28:45.952 --> 01:28:47.732]  You pull a baton out, I'm joking with you.
[01:28:47.732 --> 01:28:51.033]  The point is, is they pull a metal baton out, man, it's over.
[01:28:51.033 --> 01:28:52.434]  That's why I can't go out now.
[01:28:52.434 --> 01:28:56.255]  Because if they did that to me, I'm telling you, man, it'd be bad news.
[01:28:57.722 --> 01:28:58.943]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.943 --> 01:29:04.327]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:04.327 --> 01:29:07.230]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:10.792]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:10.792 --> 01:29:18.378]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:18.378 --> 01:29:22.982]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.

[01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:30.765]  It truly is the Christmas spirit.

[01:30:35.409 --> 01:30:38.092]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[01:30:38.953 --> 01:30:39.814]  Everybody knows it.
[01:30:39.814 --> 01:30:41.094]  History documents it.
[01:30:41.094 --> 01:30:44.717]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history.
[01:31:05.723 --> 01:31:07.224]  That wants to hurt children.
[01:31:07.224 --> 01:31:08.345]  They want to abort children.
[01:31:08.345 --> 01:31:10.106]  They want to disease children.
[01:31:10.106 --> 01:31:11.227]  They want to abuse children.
[01:31:11.227 --> 01:31:12.849]  They want to confuse children.
[01:31:12.849 --> 01:31:14.029]  They want their essence.
[01:31:14.029 --> 01:31:14.970]  They want their soul.
[01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.311]  They want their spirit.
[01:31:16.311 --> 01:31:18.073]  They want their power.
[01:31:18.073 --> 01:31:20.314]  Because they are our future.
[01:31:20.314 --> 01:31:23.817]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[01:31:23.817 --> 01:31:25.798]  It is about the West.
[01:31:25.798 --> 01:31:29.942]  And it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[01:31:29.942 --> 01:31:31.523]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[01:31:32.705 --> 01:31:43.235]  But I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[01:31:43.235 --> 01:31:45.297]  You have the power to override the censors.
[01:31:45.297 --> 01:31:49.080]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:57.468]  I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[01:31:58.482 --> 01:32:07.527]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[01:32:07.527 --> 01:32:08.867]  We've been proven dead on.
[01:32:08.867 --> 01:32:12.729]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[01:32:12.729 --> 01:32:17.131]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you.
[01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:18.412]  All words are not enough.
[01:32:19.239 --> 01:32:25.420]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:31.622]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[01:32:31.622 --> 01:32:35.623]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[01:32:35.623 --> 01:32:37.543]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[01:32:37.543 --> 01:32:41.524]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[01:32:42.117 --> 01:32:47.800]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:33:01.786]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[01:33:01.786 --> 01:33:04.447]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:49.228 --> 01:33:55.636]  I was just talking to Gavin McGinnis, founder of Vice, famous comedian.
[01:33:55.636 --> 01:33:58.640]  Like I said, called him a male chauvinist.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.002]  He says that men are inherently bad.
[01:34:00.002 --> 01:34:03.767]  There are women inherently bad, like the leftists tell us.
[01:34:05.205 --> 01:34:06.526]  He's against all the race baiting.
[01:34:06.526 --> 01:34:10.148]  Kind of like a white Martin Luther King.
[01:34:10.148 --> 01:34:12.790]  You stand for what people actually do, not what color they are.
[01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:19.574]  So that's why you're the horrible racist, because the left has gone pure racist, pure brainwashing, and called her, they want her fired now.
[01:34:19.574 --> 01:34:21.636]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:21.636 --> 01:34:23.997]  She's saying the left has turned into people that hate white males.
[01:34:23.997 --> 01:34:25.798]  Well, that's their whole religion.
[01:34:25.798 --> 01:34:27.199]  This is their whole program.
[01:34:27.199 --> 01:34:30.962]  It's a bunch of old billionaire white males manipulating it all.
[01:34:30.962 --> 01:34:33.203]  But you, during the break, I said, what do you want to hit next?
[01:34:33.203 --> 01:34:34.384]  You said, I want to make it clear.
[01:34:36.105 --> 01:34:37.327]  Go back to the date when it happened.
[01:34:37.327 --> 01:34:40.430]  Let's pull up some of the other videos, not just the fight scene.
[01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:55.126]  Just recap this because they're using this as a model to demonize any conservatives standing up to Antifa that's supposed to be the new street army of the left to take this country over, which they do use in blue cities where the police stand down.
[01:34:56.348 --> 01:34:57.809]  They can commit any crime they want.
[01:34:57.809 --> 01:35:00.431]  You want to reiterate that this was staged.
[01:35:00.431 --> 01:35:01.531]  They were waiting.
[01:35:01.531 --> 01:35:04.914]  But my friend, we got documents in January of this year.
[01:35:04.914 --> 01:35:07.375]  Eleven months ago.
[01:35:07.375 --> 01:35:08.136]  And it's been confirmed.
[01:35:09.383 --> 01:35:17.128]  By a gentleman whose brother was an antifa and his brother got in trouble and he went in there and he was, he has battle commands from George Soros Jr., Alexander Soros.
[01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:24.872]  They describe how they work with the police, the areas they stage the events, how they're trying to get black Americans to riot so they can bring martial law in.
[01:35:24.872 --> 01:35:30.376]  We have all these documents, anybody can type it in, documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[01:35:31.176 --> 01:35:31.837]  And you read these.
[01:35:31.837 --> 01:35:32.979]  These are real documents.
[01:35:32.979 --> 01:35:34.501]  This is what they do.
[01:35:34.501 --> 01:35:37.524]  So they're working with the cities they're in, just like Portland.
[01:35:37.524 --> 01:35:38.546]  So please continue.
[01:35:38.546 --> 01:35:47.457]  Okay, so the first clue something's fishy is when I told you that poor old lady at the Manhattan Republican Club was getting calls not from Manhattan, but from all over the country.
[01:35:47.757 --> 01:36:12.716]  And this is right when a thing called jobs not mobs was a big hashtag and the left was being known as unhinged and violent and the election was coming up and they needed proof that no no the right are the violent ones we're not the crazy ones because they were in trouble with Maxine Waters saying harass people and Hillary saying we are not civil and and Holder saying when they're down we kick them they were they had a bad rep and they desperately needed some bad right
[01:36:12.776 --> 01:36:18.561]  Yeah, we're gonna harass them at the gas station, the mall, restaurants, don't let, run them out of there!
[01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:21.403]  That was bad for the election, so they needed something.
[01:36:21.403 --> 01:36:27.948]  And they, the Antifa who were there, were not just brawling, they were determined to get a fight.
[01:36:28.148 --> 01:36:31.311]  Like, when they were dispersed, they went around the block and came back.
[01:36:31.311 --> 01:36:34.754]  Someone somewhere said, we need violence from these guys.
[01:36:34.754 --> 01:36:37.497]  And then they got it, and it was normal self-defense.
[01:36:37.497 --> 01:36:39.318]  And the cops said, well, I don't know what to do here.
[01:36:39.318 --> 01:36:40.620]  You said you don't want to press charges.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.681]  Doesn't seem like much of a case.
[01:36:41.681 --> 01:36:44.563]  It's only a 10-second brawl that you guys started.
[01:36:44.563 --> 01:36:44.864]  And then...
[01:36:45.684 --> 01:36:51.986]  Almost instantaneously, we see de Blasio say, oh, there's a hate group roaming the streets of New York.
[01:36:51.986 --> 01:36:53.186]  Vigilantes.
[01:36:53.186 --> 01:36:59.668]  The Attorney General said that we don't tolerate hate groups beating up random people.
[01:36:59.668 --> 01:37:02.129]  Governor Cuomo says he wants to fight me.
[01:37:02.129 --> 01:37:04.730]  He goes, hey, Gavin, I'm a boy from Queens.
[01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:05.610]  You want to mess with us?
[01:37:05.610 --> 01:37:07.230]  We don't tolerate hate groups.
[01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:08.031]  Bang, bang, bang.
[01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:08.811]  They all came out.
[01:37:09.631 --> 01:37:15.476]  In almost instantly, after all of this, and then these guys see their charges and they're like, what the hell?
[01:37:15.476 --> 01:37:17.698]  Felony riot for defending myself?
[01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:18.559]  This was a setup.
[01:37:18.559 --> 01:37:24.183]  This is just like England, where literally, remember the gypsies robbed the people's house three times?
[01:37:24.183 --> 01:37:26.626]  They, they try to, you know, they beat the guy's wife up.
[01:37:26.626 --> 01:37:28.907]  Well, the next time he gets an old ancient shotgun.
[01:37:29.668 --> 01:37:34.550]  Shoots one of them, the guy doesn't get killed, that guy, like 30 years in prison, the gypsy's nothing.
[01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:42.874]  And you see the articles all the time where the father catches the Muslim, this was this week, raping his 9-year-old daughter, he fights him off, he's going to jail.
[01:37:42.874 --> 01:37:45.755]  Because they want you to learn, you're going to lay down.
[01:37:45.755 --> 01:37:48.196]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all!
[01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:51.700]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all!
[01:38:04.819 --> 01:38:06.601]  No, I talk to cops all the time.
[01:38:06.601 --> 01:38:08.142]  The cops are down here with us.
[01:38:08.142 --> 01:38:09.624]  The cops are Proud Boys.
[01:38:09.624 --> 01:38:13.047]  No, but I mean, in Blue Cities though, the left is in command.
[01:38:13.047 --> 01:38:17.572]  Right, and like at Berkeley, they tell the cops, you may not defend these people.
[01:38:17.572 --> 01:38:19.754]  Like at Milo, the cops were told to stand down.
[01:38:19.754 --> 01:38:23.517]  Jesse Aguero, whatever his name is, told the cops to stand down because he wanted chaos.
[01:38:23.517 --> 01:38:25.159]  So I don't blame cops in any of this.
[01:38:25.159 --> 01:38:26.821]  No, I agree, but it's just like Charlottesville.
[01:38:28.222 --> 01:38:32.644]  The police are ordered to stand down, they're ordered to herd the people through the whole crowd so they get an attack going.
[01:38:32.644 --> 01:38:33.604]  Yes.
[01:38:33.604 --> 01:38:39.728]  And, you know, the more people I talk to, like when the lawyers told me I should stand down, it might help, I go, but wait a minute.
[01:38:39.728 --> 01:38:41.349]  Like, what the hell is attempted assault?
[01:38:41.349 --> 01:38:42.869]  What are all these weird charges I'm hearing?
[01:38:42.869 --> 01:38:45.231]  And they go, this case became politicized.
[01:38:45.971 --> 01:38:48.192]  And it's not following any of the rules.
[01:38:48.192 --> 01:38:50.773]  This normally would be a silly misdemeanor probation.
[01:38:50.773 --> 01:38:53.833]  And you know the craziest part of all this?
[01:38:53.833 --> 01:38:59.295]  All these guys, nine guys now facing felony charges under some made-up story about racism.
[01:38:59.295 --> 01:39:06.897]  Two of them have black wives and black kids and they're now unemployed and living back with their parents because they're racists.
[01:39:06.897 --> 01:39:09.238]  But we can always prove that that's not even the case.
[01:39:09.238 --> 01:39:11.439]  The point is the left is using race-based politics.
[01:39:12.339 --> 01:39:17.583]  As divide-and-conquer programs, and so Gavin, I know you want to help the Proud Boys.
[01:39:17.583 --> 01:39:18.643]  They're heroes.
[01:39:18.643 --> 01:39:19.544]  They're in a war.
[01:39:19.544 --> 01:39:21.545]  You've been persecuted for telling the truth.
[01:39:21.545 --> 01:39:22.686]  I've been persecuted.
[01:39:22.686 --> 01:39:23.687]  They're being persecuted.
[01:39:23.687 --> 01:39:25.648]  I'm telling you how this stuff works.
[01:39:25.648 --> 01:39:31.532]  They get you all scared, and then they get you to plea bargain, and they get you to do all this stuff.
[01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.513]  Like, how is it going to sentencing?
[01:39:33.513 --> 01:39:34.994]  They haven't had a jury trial, have they?
[01:39:34.994 --> 01:39:35.675]  No, not yet.
[01:39:35.675 --> 01:39:36.795]  There was one yesterday.
[01:39:36.795 --> 01:39:38.937]  There's been appearances so far.
[01:39:38.937 --> 01:39:40.298]  So you're saying sentencing today, though?
[01:39:40.794 --> 01:39:44.176]  No, it was just, I forget what it's called, like your appearance.
[01:39:44.176 --> 01:39:44.796]  Arraignment.
[01:39:44.796 --> 01:39:45.737]  Arraignment, yeah.
[01:39:45.737 --> 01:39:50.499]  Well here's the deal, you go in there and you say, I got physically attacked, I defend yourself.
[01:39:50.499 --> 01:39:52.320]  Let's go to that jury.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.503]  But instead, how these corrupt jurisdictions work is they come in and they scare the hell out of you.
[01:39:57.423 --> 01:40:03.809]  And they say, listen, you're going to lose these lawsuits unless you just go ahead and go meet with the Democrats.
[01:40:03.809 --> 01:40:04.409]  But they might.
[01:40:04.409 --> 01:40:11.135]  I mean, a jury in New York City is going to see alt-right hate group and they're going to go throw the book at them.
[01:40:11.135 --> 01:40:11.635]  You know what?
[01:40:11.635 --> 01:40:12.636]  You'll get killed on appeal.
[01:40:12.636 --> 01:40:14.978]  But I'm telling you, here's the deal.
[01:40:14.978 --> 01:40:16.780]  They get you to do what they want.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:17.721]  Yeah, but you're not listening to me.
[01:40:17.721 --> 01:40:19.702]  I've been through this longer than you have.
[01:40:19.702 --> 01:40:20.303]  I'm just telling you.
[01:40:21.587 --> 01:40:23.168]  They're gonna burn your guys down.
[01:40:23.168 --> 01:40:25.669]  And I'm not saying you're bad, you didn't know.
[01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:41.497]  They get you to kind of agree to a bunch of stuff, to get your leader to stand down, to make it sound like you've done something wrong, to have the leader to cry it, like, oh, they're cut away, they've done something bad, and then, oh, this guy was taken off the air, and you're just thinking, oh, I'm talking to the prosecutors, my lawyers are, they're gonna be reasonable.
[01:40:41.497 --> 01:40:43.398]  No, they're not reasonable, they're Democrat criminals.
[01:40:43.618 --> 01:40:44.619]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:40:44.619 --> 01:40:46.400]  We lost is what I'm saying, though.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.743]  Before, it was just like the Mods and the Rockers, and it was just two groups fighting.
[01:40:50.743 --> 01:40:53.484]  Then, they put my friends in prison.
[01:40:53.484 --> 01:40:55.125]  I'm not trying to make points with you.
[01:40:55.125 --> 01:40:56.086]  You're a smart guy.
[01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:03.251]  I've been through this.
[01:41:03.251 --> 01:41:04.492]  I learned.
[01:41:04.492 --> 01:41:08.014]  You know, I had them like three years ago just say, say you're sorry to the Sandy Hook parents.
[01:41:08.014 --> 01:41:10.236]  Because I figured out that I thought it happened.
[01:41:10.236 --> 01:41:13.318]  You know, they thought about babies in incubators in the Iraq war and all this other fake stuff.
[01:41:13.318 --> 01:41:14.539]  I never created the thing questioning it.
[01:41:14.539 --> 01:41:16.620]  I think people have a right to question anything they want.
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:21.243]  But I looked at it and I said, you know, I think it happened because some of the evidence people brought up turned out to not be accurate.
[01:41:21.243 --> 01:41:22.004]  Wolfgang Halbang.
[01:41:22.004 --> 01:41:23.145]  People, I'm not against Wolfgang either.
[01:41:23.145 --> 01:41:28.168]  I just had debates with Wolfgang and said, no, I think there's some people getting told PR stuff later.
[01:41:28.168 --> 01:41:29.169]  That's what looks like acting.
[01:41:29.169 --> 01:41:30.510]  But I said, I think this happened.
[01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:33.171]  Holy mackerel, dude.
[01:41:33.171 --> 01:41:37.012]  When I said, I just said, just say you're sorry you thought it happened.
[01:41:37.012 --> 01:41:39.973]  I said that, it's in.
[01:41:39.973 --> 01:41:40.933]  Penthouse this month.
[01:41:40.933 --> 01:41:41.794]  It's all over the news.
[01:41:41.794 --> 01:41:43.734]  Jones won't say he's sorry.
[01:41:43.734 --> 01:41:47.596]  He's sending people to their houses right now to bully and attack them.
[01:41:47.596 --> 01:41:51.717]  And then they put the people on TV lying, saying I'm currently doing that when I never did it.
[01:41:51.717 --> 01:41:54.198]  I just learned that that's what the left does.
[01:41:54.198 --> 01:41:57.019]  They come to you and they tell you, oh, just be reasonable.
[01:41:57.019 --> 01:41:58.699]  We have humanity.
[01:41:58.699 --> 01:41:59.860]  And it's all a setup.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:02.641]  It's all a setup, man.
[01:42:02.641 --> 01:42:09.644]  It's not the families I blame, it's these lawyers and these prosecutors, because they've learned how to use our humanity to manipulate us.
[01:42:09.644 --> 01:42:11.105]  You guys are heroes.
[01:42:11.105 --> 01:42:12.486]  You're a hero.
[01:42:12.486 --> 01:42:15.207]  The Proud Boys have never gotten arrested anywhere.
[01:42:15.207 --> 01:42:19.949]  They get attacked by meth-head professors and city employees in black outfits.
[01:42:19.949 --> 01:42:22.611]  They fight back, they violently kick their ass.
[01:42:22.611 --> 01:42:24.191]  You're heroes, so you have to be demonized.
[01:42:24.191 --> 01:42:27.313]  Instead, you have to take on you're a hero, like George Washington.
[01:42:27.313 --> 01:42:29.314]  You have to take it on, the persecution.
[01:42:29.594 --> 01:42:33.657]  And you have to never then think that they're actually trying to compromise.
[01:42:33.657 --> 01:42:35.959]  They want you destroyed.
[01:42:35.959 --> 01:42:38.000]  Because you are not a pedophile.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.221]  They were successful.
[01:42:39.221 --> 01:42:43.745]  I'm destroyed.
[01:42:43.745 --> 01:42:44.726]  They won.
[01:42:44.726 --> 01:42:45.166]  Yeah.
[01:42:45.166 --> 01:42:46.067]  We'll see about that.
[01:42:46.067 --> 01:42:47.207]  We can rebuild it.
[01:42:47.207 --> 01:42:48.288]  Bigger than it was before.
[01:42:48.288 --> 01:42:48.869]  Stronger.
[01:42:48.869 --> 01:42:50.170]  Faster.
[01:42:50.170 --> 01:42:52.812]  I can't just extend on that.
[01:42:52.812 --> 01:42:53.853]  I'm Stephen Hawking.
[01:42:57.406 --> 01:43:03.720]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.742]  Ultimate Bone Broth.

[01:43:56.994 --> 01:44:03.402]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:44:03.402 --> 01:44:04.964]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:44:04.964 --> 01:44:09.871]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[01:44:09.871 --> 01:44:12.795]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[01:44:13.335 --> 01:44:16.078]  A free gift with every order.
[01:44:16.078 --> 01:44:24.926]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:44:24.926 --> 01:44:28.609]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:33.974]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[01:44:33.974 --> 01:44:36.357]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:44:36.877 --> 01:44:41.762]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:44:41.762 --> 01:44:43.304]  So this is a lost leader.
[01:44:43.304 --> 01:44:44.866]  We are losing money on this.
[01:44:44.866 --> 01:44:46.307]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:44:46.307 --> 01:44:48.310]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:49.651]  And don't fight the crowds.

[01:44:51.073 --> 01:44:52.574]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[01:44:58.507 --> 01:45:05.632]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[01:45:58.181 --> 01:46:00.903]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:46:00.903 --> 01:46:07.229]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:08.990]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[01:46:36.354 --> 01:46:37.814]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:12.476 --> 01:47:14.157]  We can rebuild him.
[01:47:14.157 --> 01:47:17.099]  Stronger, faster, smarter than he was.
[01:47:17.099 --> 01:47:23.423]  Gavin McInnes, everybody else who's been destroyed by the globalists to be risen up like the phoenix.
[01:47:23.423 --> 01:47:26.705]  The listeners, the viewers, have to be committed.
[01:47:26.705 --> 01:47:28.246]  You are our strength.
[01:47:40.427 --> 01:47:42.309]  Okay, you're cutting out somewhat, Steve.
[01:47:42.309 --> 01:47:42.929]  Right.
[01:47:42.929 --> 01:47:44.350]  Let's get off the test frequency.
[01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:47.213]  Let's put it at 30 seconds, NASA 1.
[01:47:47.213 --> 01:47:47.813]  Roger.
[01:47:47.813 --> 01:47:48.354]  And 008, hold us heady.
[01:47:48.354 --> 01:47:52.157]  Sorry, but these are the two cameras I'm on.
[01:47:52.157 --> 01:47:54.118]  The winds are okay, Steve.
[01:47:54.118 --> 01:47:55.239]  Westerly at about 10 knots.
[01:47:55.239 --> 01:47:56.780]  Cutting off.
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:57.441]  I'm at the gate 004.
[01:47:57.441 --> 01:47:59.022]  How does that look?
[01:47:59.022 --> 01:48:01.064]  Let's cut, Steve, and all systems are okay here.
[01:48:01.064 --> 01:48:03.526]  The winds are westerly at 10 knots.
[01:48:03.526 --> 01:48:04.006]  Okay.
[01:48:04.006 --> 01:48:07.149]  This is NASA 1 calling 10 seconds now.
[01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.929]  10 seconds, roger.
[01:48:07.929 --> 01:48:08.229]  0 5 4
[01:48:20.654 --> 01:48:26.676]  This is getting banned from Facebook.
[01:48:26.676 --> 01:48:34.499]  This is getting banned from PayPal.
[01:48:34.499 --> 01:48:38.000]  And then, here we go.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.761]  This is when you become Gavin Newsom.
[01:48:49.537 --> 01:48:50.958]  Steve Austin.
[01:48:50.958 --> 01:48:52.279]  Astronaut.
[01:48:52.279 --> 01:48:53.460]  A man barely alive.
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:59.303]  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
[01:48:59.303 --> 01:49:01.485]  We have the technology.
[01:49:01.485 --> 01:49:09.410]  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man.
[01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:11.432]  Steve Austin will be that man.
[01:49:11.432 --> 01:49:15.714]  Better than he was before.
[01:49:17.627 --> 01:49:18.648]  Better.
[01:49:18.648 --> 01:49:19.128]  Stronger.
[01:49:19.128 --> 01:49:20.068]  Stronger.
[01:49:20.068 --> 01:49:20.829]  Faster.
[01:49:20.829 --> 01:49:25.711]  Faster.
[01:49:25.711 --> 01:49:30.333]  Listen, they know you have humanity, so they let them sign up and put your friends in prison.
[01:49:30.333 --> 01:49:31.874]  You guys made some mistakes.
[01:49:31.874 --> 01:49:33.875]  I didn't want to be a control freak in your business.
[01:49:33.875 --> 01:49:34.275]  Uncorrupted.
[01:49:34.275 --> 01:49:35.836]  What were the mistakes you made?
[01:49:35.836 --> 01:49:36.757]  You are wrong.
[01:49:36.757 --> 01:49:42.579]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info World.
[01:49:42.579 --> 01:49:43.240]  Listen to me.
[01:49:44.213 --> 01:49:45.814]  You're 48, I'm 45.
[01:49:45.814 --> 01:49:47.434]  You know more than I do about a lot of things.
[01:49:47.434 --> 01:49:50.075]  We talked about our kids last night for three hours.
[01:49:50.075 --> 01:49:51.316]  Women, all of them.
[01:49:51.316 --> 01:49:56.838]  It's that I've already been higher up the mountain and been to the same attacks.
[01:49:56.838 --> 01:49:57.578]  It's all wrote.
[01:49:57.578 --> 01:49:58.958]  It's all blueprints.
[01:49:58.958 --> 01:50:03.280]  So I'm telling you, I used to be like you, and I thought, oh, I'll signal this.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.200]  I'll be nice.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:06.601]  They take that as blood, and they attack.
[01:50:06.601 --> 01:50:07.641]  It's like Stone's Rules.
[01:50:09.562 --> 01:50:14.165]  The point is they take everything you do and they turn it against you and they lie and you have to understand that.
[01:50:14.165 --> 01:50:20.188]  So you're bummed out that people came to your event and a bunch of government organized by the New York City and the Democrats came to attack.
[01:50:21.308 --> 01:50:22.148]  They're putting them in prison.
[01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:23.169]  That's on them.
[01:50:23.169 --> 01:50:26.071]  That's more reason for men to go out in public and stand up to them.
[01:50:26.071 --> 01:50:28.372]  That's more reason to get more aggressive.
[01:50:28.372 --> 01:50:31.473]  Not less of a reason that we know we're dealing with bad people.
[01:50:31.473 --> 01:50:32.314]  That's why you did this.
[01:50:32.314 --> 01:50:33.354]  You've been proven right.
[01:50:33.354 --> 01:50:35.235]  So you're now entering the epic level.
[01:50:35.235 --> 01:50:36.276]  Man, this is a war.
[01:50:36.276 --> 01:50:39.858]  People go fight and die in foreign countries, and it's usually for some globalist cause.
[01:50:39.858 --> 01:50:43.800]  We're here in America fighting people that say the nation can't exist.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.821]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:50:45.821 --> 01:50:49.343]  That's the Democratic Party, Governor Cuomo, that's persecuting you and your people.
[01:50:50.063 --> 01:50:53.148]  He says, America was never great and will never be great.
[01:50:53.148 --> 01:50:55.070]  These people are the enemy!
[01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:56.632]  So is a horrible criminal group!
[01:50:57.463 --> 01:50:58.244]  Going after you?
[01:50:58.244 --> 01:51:03.788]  They're going after you, baby, because you're on the front lines kicking their ass!
[01:51:03.788 --> 01:51:06.169]  You have to embrace that attack.
[01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:08.411]  You have to tell the people you need their support.
[01:51:08.411 --> 01:51:09.852]  He's been talking about walking away.
[01:51:09.852 --> 01:51:10.392]  Not just on air.
[01:51:10.392 --> 01:51:10.813]  This is real.
[01:51:10.813 --> 01:51:11.994]  He's talking about walking away.
[01:51:11.994 --> 01:51:13.034]  They've been harassing his wife.
[01:51:13.034 --> 01:51:14.195]  He doesn't want to get into it on air.
[01:51:14.195 --> 01:51:15.956]  They've been doing horrible psyops.
[01:51:15.956 --> 01:51:21.680]  And, brother, you've got to just give it all to God and say, if I lose everything, it doesn't matter, and commit, and then.
[01:51:22.481 --> 01:51:29.065]  It'll be like all the fear, everything leaves, and it's like crystal clear, and now you're on a whole other plateau.
[01:51:29.065 --> 01:51:31.366]  You have to cross that river.
[01:51:31.366 --> 01:51:32.747]  You have to cross the Red Sea.
[01:51:32.747 --> 01:51:35.429]  I remember Tommy Robinson said that to me once.
[01:51:35.429 --> 01:51:40.652]  He said, I used to be scared of being killed, I used to be scared of dying, and, you know, my kid's not having a dad.
[01:51:40.652 --> 01:51:48.417]  And then he said, you reach a level where one day it just clicks, and you go, I might die, I might not, but I'm just gonna keep fighting.
[01:51:48.417 --> 01:51:51.158]  And he said, the fear just washed away from him.
[01:51:51.158 --> 01:51:51.919]  Now you're Lee Rogers.
[01:51:53.866 --> 01:51:57.469]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:51:57.469 --> 01:51:59.130]  I'm telling you.
[01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:03.134]  They think when they mess with me, it's the opposite now.
[01:52:03.134 --> 01:52:05.496]  It's not that I'm a sadist or sadomasochist.
[01:52:05.496 --> 01:52:09.219]  I don't like it, but it's what men are supposed to do.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.082]  This is just basic stuff.
[01:52:12.082 --> 01:52:13.505]  Yeah, standing up for yourself.
[01:52:13.505 --> 01:52:24.141]  I understand, but I also... No, you can't believe how corrupt they are, you can't believe how they lie, and you can't believe deep down, you don't feel sorry for yourself, you can't believe America is putting up with this crap!
[01:52:26.668 --> 01:52:36.275]  I have a few TV stations call me, radio stations, and they go, will you please not show or play three-year-olds putting money in g-strings of fat men wearing wigs, shaking their asses.
[01:52:36.275 --> 01:52:41.878]  And I go, okay, I'll quit for you, but you understand, this is being shown to children.
[01:52:41.878 --> 01:52:43.319]  Adults need to know what the hell's going on.
[01:52:43.319 --> 01:52:46.621]  And they go, okay, actually, you're right, but will people complain?
[01:52:46.621 --> 01:52:47.742]  I go, I know!
[01:52:47.742 --> 01:52:48.843]  They need to complain!
[01:52:48.843 --> 01:52:52.225]  They should complain about the children being assed with!
[01:52:52.225 --> 01:52:52.425]  God!
[01:52:54.967 --> 01:52:58.830]  Not me showing you, you think I like seeing this crap?
[01:52:58.830 --> 01:53:03.653]  You think it doesn't piss me off?
[01:53:03.653 --> 01:53:05.554]  Let me tell you, I'm ready to kill people.
[01:53:05.554 --> 01:53:08.516]  I'm sick of this, not literally.
[01:53:08.516 --> 01:53:13.180]  The point is, I'm getting sick of this crap.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:14.361]  That's one attitude.
[01:53:14.361 --> 01:53:17.623]  Another attitude is- Let's just give all our kids to the child molesters, God damn it.
[01:53:17.623 --> 01:53:18.023]  Excuse me.
[01:53:19.908 --> 01:53:21.251]  You know, I'm not taking the Lord's name in vain.
[01:53:21.251 --> 01:53:22.794]  I want these people down to hell.
[01:53:22.794 --> 01:53:24.819]  I'm literally praying God damn them to hell.
[01:53:24.819 --> 01:53:26.142]  That's not the Lord's name in vain.
[01:53:26.142 --> 01:53:27.024]  I mean that!
[01:53:27.024 --> 01:53:28.006]  I don't take God in vain!
[01:53:29.363 --> 01:53:32.565]  That we ought to have a prayer called the God damn it prayer!
[01:53:32.565 --> 01:53:34.946]  God damn them to hell, please!
[01:53:34.946 --> 01:53:45.992]  You think Charlton Heston in Planet of the Apes, when he realizes this is Earth, and all his family died 10,000 years before, and he's come back through a wormhole, and everybody he knows is dead, and he's saying God damn them to hell!
[01:53:45.992 --> 01:53:48.313]  You bastards, you blew it all up!
[01:53:48.313 --> 01:53:49.774]  God damn you!
[01:53:49.774 --> 01:53:51.695]  He's not taking Lord's name in vain!
[01:53:51.695 --> 01:53:54.056]  He's saying God damn them!
[01:53:54.056 --> 01:53:55.977]  God damn them!
[01:53:55.977 --> 01:53:57.138]  God damn them!
[01:53:58.078 --> 01:54:02.163]  God fucking damn them to hell!
[01:54:02.163 --> 01:54:03.946]  You seem upset.
[01:54:03.946 --> 01:54:06.288]  I'm freaking pissed, man!
[01:54:06.288 --> 01:54:11.174]  You know they're giving kids vaccines everywhere that eat their freaking cerebral cortex?
[01:54:11.174 --> 01:54:12.857]  No, I'm not really familiar with vaccines.
[01:54:14.534 --> 01:54:15.675]  But here's another attitude.
[01:54:15.675 --> 01:54:18.276]  There's two Americas now.
[01:54:18.276 --> 01:54:19.777]  There's no more cohesion.
[01:54:19.777 --> 01:54:25.980]  You have to make sure that your family is safe, that you have enough money to make sure your kids don't get brainwashed.
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:28.701]  And we are living in Planet of the Apes.
[01:54:28.701 --> 01:54:32.723]  I think we've gone past the point of no return.
[01:54:32.723 --> 01:54:35.204]  So you make sure your kid isn't at that event.
[01:54:35.204 --> 01:54:39.807]  If I went to a strip bar and little kids were given a woman money, I'd want to kick somebody's butt.
[01:54:40.526 --> 01:54:42.567]  Yeah, kids are not asexual beings.
[01:54:42.567 --> 01:54:46.610]  Why are we talking about their sex lives all the time, like drag kids and all this stuff?
[01:54:46.610 --> 01:54:51.453]  Why are we sexualizing our children and making them choose genders?
[01:54:51.453 --> 01:54:53.194]  Oh, I had a huge epiphany.
[01:54:53.194 --> 01:54:55.335]  My grandmother, when I would see something really horrible, I'd say, Jesus.
[01:54:55.335 --> 01:54:57.296]  And she'd say, don't take it away from him in vain.
[01:54:57.296 --> 01:54:59.378]  That's some weird brainwashed Baptist thing.
[01:54:59.378 --> 01:55:03.100]  I love God, but I'm involuntarily calling on Jesus.
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:06.942]  When I see them sexually brainwashing children, I'm saying, Jesus, save us!
[01:55:06.942 --> 01:55:09.464]  You need to call on Jesus, Gavin.
[01:55:10.512 --> 01:55:13.154]  I've been doing a lot of praying past month.
[01:55:13.154 --> 01:55:14.595]  You wanna pray with me right now?
[01:55:14.595 --> 01:55:15.335]  Sure.
[01:55:15.335 --> 01:55:16.336]  We come back from reckless to it.
[01:55:16.336 --> 01:55:17.117]  I get into a rage.
[01:55:17.117 --> 01:55:19.338]  I apologize.
[01:55:19.338 --> 01:55:20.199]  But I really don't.
[01:55:20.199 --> 01:55:21.840]  I gotta plug or I'm gonna go bankrupt.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.201]  The enemy's totally trying to shut us down.
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:28.282]  The enemy, all they ever say is we're not real, because they know damn well we're real.
[01:55:28.282 --> 01:55:30.784]  100%, 100% folks, I'm ready.
[01:55:30.784 --> 01:55:33.565]  I'm trying to figure out how to beat these people every damn second.
[01:55:33.565 --> 01:55:35.446]  Because my very cells cried against them.
[01:55:35.446 --> 01:55:39.269]  My very spirit is just on fire to defeat these people.
[01:55:39.269 --> 01:55:42.691]  And I want to spread the fire of liberty into your mind and others' minds.
[01:55:42.691 --> 01:55:44.192]  It's not my fire, it's God's fire.
[01:55:44.952 --> 01:55:51.358]  Let me tell you something, you ask Christ in your heart, not the fake devil you get at these churches, but the real Christ, you'll be on fire as well.
[01:55:51.358 --> 01:55:55.022]  And it's not a God of weakness, it's a God of strength and of overcoming these people.
[01:55:56.235 --> 01:56:01.337]  And I need your financial support so I can expand and support others and the work they're going to do.
[01:56:01.337 --> 01:56:05.198]  And quite frankly, the deals we have are so good, we're losing money on a lot of these, but I'm clearing my whole warehouse out.
[01:56:05.198 --> 01:56:12.800]  Free t-shirt with every order, 50-75% off, double Patriot points, and so much more at infowarestore.com.
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:13.801]  It is insane.
[01:56:13.801 --> 01:56:17.342]  Air filtration, water filtration, 60% off, all super blue, fluoride free.
[01:56:18.662 --> 01:56:21.203]  Coil Silver Iodine Fortified Systems.
[01:56:21.203 --> 01:56:23.443]  They're about to sell at Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:27.124]  They sold us, at cost, incredible four-stage ion filter system.
[01:56:27.124 --> 01:56:29.424]  The competitors are $600, $500.
[01:56:29.424 --> 01:56:30.545]  They're a great deal at $240.
[01:56:30.545 --> 01:56:32.845]  They're at $127 right now.
[01:56:32.845 --> 01:56:34.566]  I'm doing that as a favor to them.
[01:56:34.566 --> 01:56:36.766]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:36.766 --> 01:56:37.026]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:56:37.026 --> 01:56:39.107]  And Gavin, you're such a good guy.
[01:56:46.028 --> 01:56:53.290]  You're not even here on air with a website, or they won't even let you have a GoFundMe or whatever, but I'm gonna try to, hopefully if you want to work with some sponsorship or something, whatever.
[01:56:53.290 --> 01:56:57.972]  The point is, you need to get back on that horse, and you need to take care of your wife for a few weeks.
[01:56:57.972 --> 01:57:10.456]  I know they're harassing the hell out of her, you told me probably what's happening, maybe you'll tell them publicly, but then that just makes them go after her more, and just do what you, you know, Tucker Carlson, as we all know, has moved to a place I won't say where, and the harassment's been unbelievable there, and everybody else, I get it.
[01:57:11.503 --> 01:57:13.147]  It's mainstream.
[01:57:13.147 --> 01:57:14.189]  He's not a radical guy.
[01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:15.832]  Remember, we had dinner with him a couple nights ago.
[01:57:15.832 --> 01:57:17.535]  Is that classified information?
[01:57:17.535 --> 01:57:18.678]  Uh, no.
[01:57:18.678 --> 01:57:20.181]  But, uh... Well, let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:57:21.325 --> 01:57:23.267]  Gavin, your YouTube's still up for now.
[01:57:23.267 --> 01:57:24.007]  Tell people how they find that.
[01:57:24.007 --> 01:57:27.791]  And they should all go subscribe, so you can then contact them once you get a website.
[01:57:27.791 --> 01:57:31.454]  I promise you, my YouTube will be down within the week.
[01:57:31.454 --> 01:57:32.655]  Guaranteed.
[01:57:32.655 --> 01:57:35.478]  I'm stunned it came back, because the reason it was posted... Well, it's fraud.
[01:57:35.478 --> 01:57:37.039]  We'll explain that fraud when we come back.
[01:57:37.039 --> 01:57:38.541]  It's all bigger than Gavin McGinnis.
[01:57:38.541 --> 01:57:39.542]  It's bigger than Alex Jones.
[01:57:39.542 --> 01:57:40.503]  It's bigger than all of us.
[01:57:40.503 --> 01:57:41.243]  It's the universe.
[01:57:41.243 --> 01:57:41.964]  It's God.
[01:57:41.964 --> 01:57:42.585]  It's the devil.
[01:57:42.585 --> 01:57:43.325]  It's your soul.
[01:57:43.325 --> 01:57:44.286]  It's your destiny.
[01:57:44.286 --> 01:57:45.207]  It's your free will.
[01:57:45.207 --> 01:57:46.228]  Make the right decision.
[01:57:46.228 --> 01:57:47.429]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:47.449 --> 01:57:55.733]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.733 --> 01:57:57.194]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.194 --> 01:58:01.896]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.896 --> 01:58:06.899]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:58:07.139 --> 01:58:27.294]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.794 --> 01:58:31.779]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:00:01.306 --> 02:00:05.310]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:13.218]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.045 --> 02:00:29.687]  All right, Gavin, I want to give the number out.
[02:00:29.687 --> 02:00:32.869]  Coming up in about 15 minutes, I'm going to take phone calls with you, but I've been ranting.
[02:00:32.869 --> 02:00:34.130]  I want to give you the floor.
[02:00:34.130 --> 02:00:46.316]  Let's get off how they're persecuting you and how they're just in general kind of a bunch of thugs and bullies and those ridiculous Google hearings that we just had on Tuesday that our team did a great job covering.
[02:00:46.316 --> 02:00:51.659]  And let's just say I enjoyed getting Sundar's face, that authoritarian monster,
[02:00:53.169 --> 02:00:55.811]  Oh, then Google's headquarters burst aflame the next day.
[02:00:55.811 --> 02:00:56.732]  I was very upset about that.
[02:00:56.732 --> 02:01:01.937]  You know, there's a major rebellion inside all the tech companies.
[02:01:01.937 --> 02:01:04.539]  I've heard about that, yeah, because they can't all be left-wing.
[02:01:04.539 --> 02:01:05.981]  Not all nerds are beta now.
[02:01:05.981 --> 02:01:11.385]  Actually, it's the real liberals that are classic liberals that are the ones that are most... not leftist, liberals.
[02:01:11.385 --> 02:01:12.827]  Like Dave Rubin types.
[02:01:12.827 --> 02:01:13.427]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:13.427 --> 02:01:14.848]  They're like, what the hell?
[02:01:15.649 --> 02:01:18.371]  And they know conservatives are really nice people.
[02:01:18.371 --> 02:01:20.973]  You know, you've got to check out the Wikipedia for Proud Boys.
[02:01:20.973 --> 02:01:23.936]  It's been totally infiltrated with this Antifa groups.
[02:01:23.936 --> 02:01:27.338]  And it says Antifa, like that's part of their profile.
[02:01:27.338 --> 02:01:34.244]  And it goes off about how we're very worried about white men and racism and white supremacy.
[02:01:34.244 --> 02:01:37.826]  And it's the least factual Wikipedia I've ever seen.
[02:01:37.826 --> 02:01:40.869]  Like they're worried about the death of men, especially white men.
[02:01:40.869 --> 02:01:44.352]  How does a dictionary get to say especially white men?
[02:01:44.932 --> 02:01:45.693]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:01:45.693 --> 02:01:50.458]  They let the quote, Antifa, a known terror organization, actually list it as one.
[02:01:50.458 --> 02:01:52.419]  They lie and say you are, it wasn't even true.
[02:01:52.419 --> 02:01:54.502]  And then they get to sit there and edit it, but you don't.
[02:01:54.502 --> 02:01:55.142]  Yes.
[02:01:55.142 --> 02:01:57.104]  Antifa is not just on the streets.
[02:01:57.104 --> 02:01:58.626]  They are all over Wikipedia.
[02:01:58.626 --> 02:02:00.067]  They've totally taken over that site.
[02:02:00.067 --> 02:02:01.949]  Let's talk about the New York Post.
[02:02:01.949 --> 02:02:03.831]  They're in mainstream news places.
[02:02:03.831 --> 02:02:06.073]  Well, the CNN depends on MSNBC.
[02:02:06.073 --> 02:02:07.555]  They are the paramilitary brigade.
[02:02:07.555 --> 02:02:08.395]  We'll get to that next segment.
[02:02:09.335 --> 02:02:10.716]  Let's talk about this.
[02:02:10.716 --> 02:02:17.342]  What is the profile of your average Antifa general, down to the mentally ill method?
[02:02:17.342 --> 02:02:18.322]  It depends on the city.
[02:02:18.322 --> 02:02:28.170]  In New York, there are rich kid academics who are doing their PhD, their dissertation, and they read about Marx all day, and they're jealous of these communist revolutionaries.
[02:02:28.170 --> 02:02:32.394]  And they get a lot of poontang, because the women see it as a rebel.
[02:02:32.754 --> 02:02:34.815]  Yeah, I'm fighting for justice.
[02:02:34.815 --> 02:02:37.497]  I'm the Freedom Rider from the 60s.
[02:02:37.497 --> 02:02:52.988]  But you have other places like Berkeley where a lot of these poor bastards are homeless kids who were taken in by Yvette Falarca types and they stay at these homes that I think are linked to globalists and they feel beholden to the people who took them in.
[02:02:53.708 --> 02:02:56.811]  And they're begging for change.
[02:02:56.811 --> 02:02:59.793]  They are quartered little paramilitary groups.
[02:02:59.793 --> 02:03:02.175]  Yes, like domesticated animals.
[02:03:02.175 --> 02:03:07.119]  That's been around, their low-level one, and they're all like meth-head, mentally retarded, kind of semi-autistic.
[02:03:07.119 --> 02:03:08.720]  Yeah, that's Berkeley and Portland.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:10.602]  They have a lot of homeless losers.
[02:03:10.602 --> 02:03:15.626]  And, by the way, another big thing in Antifa no one ever talks about is the sexual perversions.
[02:03:15.626 --> 02:03:19.909]  When you look at their Twitter feed, when you find them... Oh, it's like dudes dressed as a woman with a machine gun.
[02:03:20.009 --> 02:03:20.669]  Yes, yes.
[02:03:20.669 --> 02:03:22.890]  And they follow these tranny porn sites.
[02:03:22.890 --> 02:03:24.790]  Type in Antifa losers and click images.
[02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:25.951]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:03:25.951 --> 02:03:26.631]  It is bizarre.
[02:03:26.631 --> 02:03:33.573]  And you realize, wait a minute, like there was that guy Mika Rhodes who was just arrested for raping several... There's this guy too.
[02:03:33.573 --> 02:03:34.313]  He's a commando.
[02:03:34.313 --> 02:03:35.214]  He's like one of the main leaders.
[02:03:35.214 --> 02:03:37.274]  That's the guy that sent the people to Tucker Carlson's house.
[02:03:37.274 --> 02:03:37.994]  Yep, yep.
[02:03:37.994 --> 02:03:39.435]  Michael Isaacson, I think his name is.
[02:03:39.995 --> 02:03:41.275]  No human PEZ dispenser.
[02:03:41.275 --> 02:03:44.016]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:45.617]  No USA at all?
[02:03:45.617 --> 02:03:46.337]  What's here?
[02:03:46.337 --> 02:03:46.857]  Do we have a flash?
[02:03:46.857 --> 02:03:50.119]  I gotta say though, he's got, I mean my neck's only 20 inches solid muscle.
[02:03:50.119 --> 02:03:52.279]  That guy's got a powerful neck.
[02:03:52.279 --> 02:03:53.820]  He could probably take a hammer blow.
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:54.900]  He's malicious.
[02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:56.761]  They're a dangerous bunch, but...
[02:03:57.830 --> 02:04:02.433]  But, uh, yeah, they, I think, like Mika Rhodes, sorry, so he was just arrested.
[02:04:02.433 --> 02:04:06.516]  He was raping underage men, men and women, couples.
[02:04:06.516 --> 02:04:08.257]  Mika Rhodes, the head of Portland Antifa.
[02:04:08.257 --> 02:04:16.242]  And you realize, oh, this group is trying to destroy traditionalism because they're sexual perverts.
[02:04:16.242 --> 02:04:16.962]  They're criminals!
[02:04:16.962 --> 02:04:22.266]  Like Luke Kuhn was one of the guys that Project Veritas caught talking about bombing Deplora Ball and gassing it.
[02:04:22.606 --> 02:04:26.808]  And then we see that he writes fan fiction about sexualizing 10-year-old boys.
[02:04:26.808 --> 02:04:29.449]  And you realize, you're all sexual?
[02:04:29.449 --> 02:04:32.871]  Who's the other liberal that got caught watching tentacle porn?
[02:04:32.871 --> 02:04:35.993]  Oh yeah, was that the bald guy?
[02:04:35.993 --> 02:04:36.173]  What?
[02:04:37.952 --> 02:04:38.553]  What's his name?
[02:04:38.553 --> 02:04:39.794]  By the way, Kurt Eichenwohn.
[02:04:39.794 --> 02:04:42.658]  Yeah, it's all totally insane.
[02:04:42.658 --> 02:04:44.080]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:46.142]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:04:46.142 --> 02:04:49.606]  Hopefully Gavin will have a website and we'll get back on the horse.
[02:04:49.606 --> 02:04:50.948]  I want to push the Proud Boys fundraiser.
[02:04:50.948 --> 02:04:53.551]  I tell you, I'm going to kick your ass if you don't get back on air.
[02:04:53.551 --> 02:04:54.752]  Let's just have a fight when we come back.
[02:04:56.144 --> 02:05:02.530]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:05:02.530 --> 02:05:04.092]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:05:04.092 --> 02:05:08.996]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[02:05:08.996 --> 02:05:11.919]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[02:05:12.459 --> 02:05:15.200]  A free gift with every order.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:24.063]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:05:24.063 --> 02:05:27.724]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[02:05:27.724 --> 02:05:33.086]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[02:05:33.086 --> 02:05:35.467]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[02:05:36.027 --> 02:05:40.889]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[02:05:40.889 --> 02:05:42.429]  So this is a lost leader.
[02:05:42.429 --> 02:05:44.010]  We are losing money on this.
[02:05:44.010 --> 02:05:45.430]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:48.772]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.
[02:05:48.772 --> 02:05:50.872]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:50.872 --> 02:05:52.893]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[02:06:06.471 --> 02:06:11.316]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:06:11.316 --> 02:06:12.998]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:12.998 --> 02:06:14.780]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:20.826]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:36.738 --> 02:06:38.059]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest.
[02:06:38.059 --> 02:06:42.143]  Well, there's a lot of big breaking news at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:06:42.143 --> 02:06:44.444]  There's so many other big issues, but I gotta say something right now.
[02:06:44.444 --> 02:06:47.487]  I don't just be honest with everybody, point blank.
[02:06:47.487 --> 02:06:55.634]  If America can't beat the Democratic Party and their leader, Hillary Clinton, who is still in control of it, I don't just have internal emails that are out there.
[02:06:55.634 --> 02:06:57.795]  I have the people that literally guard her.
[02:06:58.777 --> 02:07:04.181]  Repeatedly came to see me, and they said, this is going to happen, that's going to happen, we want you to say this on air.
[02:07:04.181 --> 02:07:06.542]  And I didn't say it, so more people came and told me.
[02:07:06.542 --> 02:07:09.304]  And then sure enough, it got announced that Hillary still plans to run for president.
[02:07:09.304 --> 02:07:10.445]  People think this is crazy.
[02:07:10.445 --> 02:07:11.466]  She's doing it.
[02:07:11.466 --> 02:07:14.508]  If we can't defeat her politically, and a bunch of meth-head antifa,
[02:07:15.288 --> 02:07:20.872]  And this latest footage in Portland that was exclusive to Infowars.com, a shock video.
[02:07:20.872 --> 02:07:24.375]  Antifa terrorizes local Portland residents protesting mayor.
[02:07:24.375 --> 02:07:26.336]  Hits them with clubs, eggs, everything.
[02:07:26.336 --> 02:07:27.857]  And the police let them do it.
[02:07:27.857 --> 02:07:31.820]  They wear patches that show a Christian cross with a slash through it.
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:35.442]  I mean, these are the scum of the earth.
[02:07:35.442 --> 02:07:40.006]  And this is what the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi have defended.
[02:07:40.006 --> 02:07:42.648]  And these are groups that praise murder of cops.
[02:07:43.493 --> 02:07:46.095]  And, you know, I've not been anti-police.
[02:07:46.095 --> 02:07:49.117]  I'm anti-authoritarianism and I've gotten on bad cops before.
[02:07:49.117 --> 02:07:58.564]  But if the police and their unions and other people don't organize in your blue cities and stop putting up with this crap, you are aiding and abetting and are now part of the problem.
[02:07:58.564 --> 02:08:01.006]  And I'm about to get pissed.
[02:08:01.006 --> 02:08:03.488]  Here in Austin, every cop I run into is a great guy.
[02:08:03.488 --> 02:08:05.049]  Hispanic, black, they're all white.
[02:08:05.049 --> 02:08:06.370]  They're all great people.
[02:08:06.370 --> 02:08:07.751]  Smart people.
[02:08:07.751 --> 02:08:11.054]  I would swear if I was to go down for that young lady that got shot in the back by that illegal alien,
[02:08:12.284 --> 02:08:15.965]  And then the grand jury in San Francisco said, or the jury said, not guilty.
[02:08:15.965 --> 02:08:17.505]  You just, you know, she's white, she deserves to die.
[02:08:17.505 --> 02:08:19.006]  Shoot her in the back.
[02:08:19.006 --> 02:08:24.667]  They had assault rifles, you know, semi-auto AK-47s, and said, are you scared, boy?
[02:08:24.667 --> 02:08:26.328]  And were hitting him with clubs.
[02:08:26.328 --> 02:08:28.608]  He's by himself, because he's such a go-getter.
[02:08:28.608 --> 02:08:30.209]  He's just always out there.
[02:08:30.209 --> 02:08:31.129]  And he wasn't scared.
[02:08:31.129 --> 02:08:31.869]  They said, why are you shaking?
[02:08:31.869 --> 02:08:32.689]  Well, I talked to Owen.
[02:08:32.689 --> 02:08:33.390]  Owen's a tough guy.
[02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:34.130]  He's about to attack him.
[02:08:34.730 --> 02:08:42.817]  That's why I can't get around that without security because if dudes have guns and start bumping me, I mean, I'm going to go into King Kong mode.
[02:08:42.817 --> 02:08:46.700]  And I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around, but in that mode, it's like it's dangerous.
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:48.942]  It's dangerous because I just I'm gone.
[02:08:48.942 --> 02:08:49.503]  I'm not thinking.
[02:08:49.503 --> 02:08:51.384]  And it's like bad stuff happens.
[02:08:51.384 --> 02:08:51.485]  And.
[02:08:55.021 --> 02:08:57.162]  I actually had panic attacks about this.
[02:08:57.162 --> 02:08:59.903]  I can't even watch the video.
[02:08:59.903 --> 02:09:00.563]  I'm so proud of him.
[02:09:00.563 --> 02:09:01.624]  They're hitting him in the side.
[02:09:01.624 --> 02:09:04.185]  They do that to me too when I'm out on camera.
[02:09:04.185 --> 02:09:05.205]  And they're pointing guns at him.
[02:09:05.205 --> 02:09:05.785]  You're scared.
[02:09:05.785 --> 02:09:08.926]  And the Austin police sit there and take it, man.
[02:09:08.926 --> 02:09:15.549]  They're sitting there 50 feet away and they let guys with guns literally follow my guy around and assault him.
[02:09:15.549 --> 02:09:18.570]  And man, I tell you, it makes me want to throw up.
[02:09:18.570 --> 02:09:20.011]  It makes me want to move out of this town too.
[02:09:21.482 --> 02:09:40.250]  Our infrastructure's here, my family's here, but just to know you live in a lawless, criminal city, where the Democrat city council members actually canvas at the polls, at the polling station, telling you to vote for committing crimes, that just the lawlessness of the tech companies and the Democrats, they're criminals!
[02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:43.172]  They're a criminal group that's gotten away with everything!
[02:09:43.172 --> 02:09:44.832]  Go ahead.
[02:09:44.832 --> 02:09:48.274]  I got this buddy Levi, and there was a, you know who Yvette Falarca is?
[02:09:48.274 --> 02:09:50.675]  She runs By Any Means Necessary, BAM.
[02:09:50.675 --> 02:09:50.835]  Yeah.
[02:09:51.135 --> 02:09:55.100]  A little Filipino teacher that I think she was arrested recently, finally.
[02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:59.885]  But her and the mayor have this weird relationship that it looks like they're in cahoots.
[02:09:59.885 --> 02:10:05.471]  And there was a rally, I think it was Base Stickman, Milo, something like that, some Patriot rally.
[02:10:06.252 --> 02:10:14.477]  And she was standing there, and he was joking around, and he was on the other side of the petition with the lefties, and he's saying, hey guys, I'm on this side now.
[02:10:14.477 --> 02:10:15.177]  I don't like the right.
[02:10:15.177 --> 02:10:16.198]  He was joking around.
[02:10:16.198 --> 02:10:17.038]  And people were laughing.
[02:10:17.038 --> 02:10:18.860]  It was totally non-violent.
[02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:21.241]  He went a little close to Yvette Falarca.
[02:10:21.241 --> 02:10:22.221]  Just a little close.
[02:10:22.221 --> 02:10:23.462]  He was about six inches.
[02:10:23.462 --> 02:10:24.963]  This is not him coming at her.
[02:10:24.963 --> 02:10:29.446]  This is him making fun of us on the other side, going, I don't like Trump anymore.
[02:10:29.446 --> 02:10:30.086]  I like this side.
[02:10:30.086 --> 02:10:31.087]  He was just being a goof.
[02:10:31.727 --> 02:10:37.410]  The second he went near her, all of a sudden these cops, who weren't arresting anyone, exploded into life!
[02:10:37.410 --> 02:10:39.571]  It was like, who put a quarter in you?
[02:10:39.571 --> 02:10:40.332]  Woo!
[02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:44.514]  And they grab him, and they throw him down, and they arrest him, and they grind his face.
[02:10:44.514 --> 02:10:51.838]  Someone somewhere had said that Yvette, no one had better go remotely close to her, and the cops were definitely told.
[02:10:51.838 --> 02:10:54.479]  So now we have the cops protecting Antifa.
[02:10:54.479 --> 02:10:57.241]  These same Antifa who were saying, what do we want?
[02:10:57.241 --> 02:10:57.981]  Dead cops!
[02:10:57.981 --> 02:10:58.822]  When do we want them now?
[02:10:59.542 --> 02:11:01.564]  I mean, how is that for your morale?
[02:11:01.564 --> 02:11:04.966]  Go protect the people who want you dead.
[02:11:04.966 --> 02:11:07.128]  And give them more rights.
[02:11:07.128 --> 02:11:08.689]  I've always been worried about state power.
[02:11:08.689 --> 02:11:11.952]  And the Democrats won't control the police, so they have state power.
[02:11:11.952 --> 02:11:17.857]  So about eight years ago, I went from being very critical of the police, in many cases, not all cases, it was against the police themselves.
[02:11:17.857 --> 02:11:20.899]  Because I always wondered, oh, our listeners really like it when I cover bad cops.
[02:11:20.899 --> 02:11:23.961]  No, Google was pushing it, because it's part of a larger narrative.
[02:11:23.961 --> 02:11:24.982]  I figured it out.
[02:11:24.982 --> 02:11:26.904]  We were instantly, when we became pro-cop,
[02:11:28.075 --> 02:11:29.377]  In general, we were demonetized.
[02:11:47.253 --> 02:11:52.415]  And then a cop deserves to be shot in the back of the head pumping gas, or changing a tire, or whatever.
[02:11:52.415 --> 02:11:55.016]  And then they're dead, and we never even hear their name.
[02:11:55.016 --> 02:12:00.898]  It's like, oh, if some gangbanger pulls a gun on cops and they shoot him, his name is carved in stone.
[02:12:00.898 --> 02:12:04.080]  And it's not that I'm against black people or anybody.
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:10.402]  They killed a bunch of black cops in Dallas, and CNN was like, well, it doesn't matter, because it's sick.
[02:12:10.402 --> 02:12:12.403]  I don't want anybody getting shot in the back of the head.
[02:12:12.503 --> 02:12:16.306]  They caught, they shot- I mean that pisses, these are dangerous people on TV!
[02:12:16.306 --> 02:12:19.828]  They- Promoting, shooting police in the back of the head!
[02:12:19.828 --> 02:12:22.670]  And the police kiss their ass!
[02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:23.711]  God, I'm tired of it!
[02:12:24.534 --> 02:12:26.995]  You know, there's so... We got the guy... This is dangerous!
[02:12:26.995 --> 02:12:28.256]  This is dangerous!
[02:12:28.256 --> 02:12:34.418]  It is dangerous because you normalize it and you have all these commercials about how cops are killing people and cops are hunting people.
[02:12:34.418 --> 02:12:39.360]  And so you keep sending that message out and the next thing you know they go, well, I gotta defend myself.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.402]  So we had that guy who tweeted out, I'm gonna make pigs fly tonight.
[02:12:43.402 --> 02:12:49.124]  And he goes to New York City and he shoots a Hispanic and an Asian cop in their squad cars.
[02:12:49.124 --> 02:12:51.145]  They're dead because of this myth.
[02:12:51.145 --> 02:12:52.385]  And no one knows their name.
[02:12:52.385 --> 02:12:53.726]  We know Trayvon Martin's name.
[02:12:54.306 --> 02:12:58.333]  We don't know all the... Can you name any of the dead cops?
[02:12:58.333 --> 02:12:58.854]  No.
[02:12:58.854 --> 02:13:00.857]  I'm embarrassed that I can't.
[02:13:00.857 --> 02:13:04.062]  Well, but the point is because they didn't say it 85,000 times.
[02:13:04.062 --> 02:13:04.443]  Yeah.
[02:13:04.443 --> 02:13:05.524]  Because they dehumanized them.
[02:13:07.765 --> 02:13:17.811]  And now you see the whole thing, and you see how if I could get caught partially by leftist brainwashing, and I'm pretty smart, I know other young people get caught by it, but it's just ridiculous.
[02:13:17.811 --> 02:13:19.471]  Well, there's two problems going on here.
[02:13:19.471 --> 02:13:21.873]  One is this wave of propaganda spreading lies.
[02:13:21.873 --> 02:13:24.654]  The other is people accepting these lies.
[02:13:24.654 --> 02:13:28.737]  We're living in the most incurious time in American history.
[02:13:28.737 --> 02:13:34.060]  So you have these lazy journalists sending out lies, and then people going, oh, I hear that guy's a Nazi.
[02:13:34.060 --> 02:13:35.440]  Yeah, oh, he beats kids.
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:36.261]  Yeah, I don't like that guy.
[02:13:36.741 --> 02:13:37.823]  They should fire him.
[02:13:37.823 --> 02:13:39.225]  He should go to jail.
[02:13:39.225 --> 02:13:39.926]  Oh, the Proud Boys?
[02:13:39.926 --> 02:13:40.927]  They're going to jail?
[02:13:40.927 --> 02:13:42.570]  Well, they're an alt-right hate group.
[02:13:42.570 --> 02:13:44.592]  You know, the FBI said they're an alt-right hate group.
[02:13:44.592 --> 02:13:45.113]  No, they didn't!
[02:13:45.933 --> 02:13:47.534]  But they have to go to jail now.
[02:13:47.534 --> 02:13:51.055]  By the way, I really want to promote FundTheWest.org.
[02:13:51.055 --> 02:13:52.396]  That is their legal defense fund.
[02:13:52.396 --> 02:13:53.917]  These guys are blue collar.
[02:13:53.917 --> 02:13:56.278]  I've been trying to get you to plug something.
[02:13:56.278 --> 02:13:57.778]  Thank you.
[02:13:57.778 --> 02:13:59.519]  You're really in the spotlight right now.
[02:13:59.519 --> 02:14:01.000]  Please plug for their defense.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.120]  FundTheWest.org.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.321]  These guys are going to trial.
[02:14:03.321 --> 02:14:04.622]  It's going to be $35,000 a person.
[02:14:04.622 --> 02:14:05.802]  That's 35 times 9.
[02:14:05.802 --> 02:14:06.863]  That's just under $350,000.
[02:14:06.863 --> 02:14:07.963]  They go to 1776.shop.
[02:14:07.963 --> 02:14:08.944]  That's a badass name.
[02:14:14.286 --> 02:14:15.407]  Yeah, it is.
[02:14:15.407 --> 02:14:16.427]  So you just buy a bracelet there.
[02:14:16.427 --> 02:14:20.909]  It doesn't matter what the bracelet is, but I bought the $5,000 one.
[02:14:20.909 --> 02:14:24.351]  You can spend as little or as much as you want.
[02:14:24.351 --> 02:14:28.613]  But these guys need, you know, they're probably going to try to shut this site down.
[02:14:28.613 --> 02:14:30.634]  What's the matter with a fair trial?
[02:14:30.634 --> 02:14:31.874]  Ted Bundy got a trial.
[02:14:31.874 --> 02:14:33.375]  Jeffrey Dahmer got a trial.
[02:14:33.375 --> 02:14:35.696]  Why are they trying to stop a legal defense fund?
[02:14:35.696 --> 02:14:37.777]  You keep acting like they're going to listen to moral appeals.
[02:14:37.777 --> 02:14:38.918]  These are not moral people.
[02:14:39.998 --> 02:14:43.102]  You remember when they shot Congressman Scalise and tried to kill 18 others?
[02:14:43.102 --> 02:14:55.055]  And I have the clip, and they have the friend on of the guy that looks like a child molester, the guy that shot Scalise and tried to shoot others, and they go, he was a hero, he wasn't bad, and like, Wolf Blitzer nods his head like, yeah.
[02:14:55.055 --> 02:14:55.735]  Oh my god.
[02:14:55.735 --> 02:14:57.037]  Wasn't that because of the SPLC?
[02:14:57.037 --> 02:15:01.622]  Didn't he say, one of the reasons I came here was because I saw him on the SPLC's hate list?
[02:15:02.022 --> 02:15:09.606]  And there was another guy at the Family Research Council, a black guy, who was shot, security guard, because some nut read it on the SPLC hate list.
[02:15:09.606 --> 02:15:17.351]  See, when they make up these lies about us being Nazis and everything, some lunatic reads it and now we're getting shot and killed.
[02:15:17.351 --> 02:15:20.513]  And the SPLC is raking in $430 million that we know of.
[02:15:22.754 --> 02:15:23.434]  No, no, no, no.
[02:15:23.434 --> 02:15:24.375]  You didn't know this?
[02:15:24.375 --> 02:15:28.096]  They've got billions, several billion in offshore.
[02:15:28.096 --> 02:15:30.017]  Yeah, I saw it came in islands.
[02:15:30.017 --> 02:15:32.318]  In one suit, 500 mil was found.
[02:15:32.318 --> 02:15:33.878]  It's two bill.
[02:15:33.878 --> 02:15:35.039]  In the Bahamas.
[02:15:35.039 --> 02:15:37.059]  To get conservatives killed.
[02:15:37.059 --> 02:15:37.960]  Nice organization.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:44.422]  Meanwhile, George Soros is a literal Nazi collaborator and said it on 60 Minutes.
[02:15:44.422 --> 02:15:45.722]  But he gets awards for it.
[02:15:45.722 --> 02:15:47.383]  Oh, he's called a Holocaust survivor.
[02:15:47.383 --> 02:15:48.844]  Well, technically you did survive.
[02:15:48.844 --> 02:15:49.544]  So did Mengele.
[02:15:51.325 --> 02:15:52.513]  We'll be back.

[02:17:57.083 --> 02:18:03.028]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[02:18:03.028 --> 02:18:04.870]  So I'll say it short and sweet.
[02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:07.232]  We need your support now, more than ever.
[02:18:07.232 --> 02:18:10.074]  You've come through a thousand times, so I'm not bitching at you.
[02:18:10.074 --> 02:18:13.077]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[02:18:13.077 --> 02:18:16.900]  The attacks on InfoWars have become absolutely exponential.
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:18.722]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[02:18:20.025 --> 02:18:31.970]  I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:33.891]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[02:18:33.891 --> 02:18:39.573]  I need to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[02:18:39.573 --> 02:18:40.453]  But I need your prayers.
[02:18:40.453 --> 02:18:42.334]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[02:18:42.334 --> 02:18:44.295]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[02:18:44.295 --> 02:18:45.055]  We make it easy.
[02:18:45.595 --> 02:18:52.359]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the Globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon, and you'll help provision us.
[02:18:52.359 --> 02:18:56.341]  We've got a bunch of huge deals, InfoWarsTore.com, so please take action right now.
[02:18:56.341 --> 02:19:04.686]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:06.711]  We've been proven dead on.
[02:19:06.711 --> 02:19:10.574]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[02:19:10.574 --> 02:19:15.217]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[02:19:15.217 --> 02:19:17.098]  Words are not enough.
[02:19:17.098 --> 02:19:23.282]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[02:19:23.282 --> 02:19:29.507]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[02:19:29.507 --> 02:19:32.829]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[02:19:33.459 --> 02:19:35.400]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:39.841]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globally anti-human future.
[02:19:39.841 --> 02:19:45.662]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[02:19:45.662 --> 02:19:59.226]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[02:19:59.226 --> 02:20:02.327]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:12.343 --> 02:20:20.772]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:42.563 --> 02:20:45.546]  Alright, we're not talking about Gavin McInnes, we're talking about Alex Jones.
[02:20:45.546 --> 02:20:48.909]  We're talking about the globalist plan to shut down America and defeat the country.
[02:20:48.909 --> 02:21:04.643]  So they're going after us because they want to set the precedent on popular people, populists, but also what they see as low-hanging fruit because we've been satirical, we've said some wild things out of context, but they can take us down.
[02:21:04.643 --> 02:21:06.504]  The real target is Matt Grudge.
[02:21:08.415 --> 02:21:10.037]  He's the biggest thing in the world.
[02:21:10.037 --> 02:21:13.279]  And then their next target is everybody.
[02:21:13.279 --> 02:21:27.790]  And they've announced, the Democratic Party Buzzfeed, oh, we've had riots in France, not because the taxes are 85% on poor people, and the gas tax, you know, is an extra, you know, euro per liter, so now it's like $7, basically a gallon, if you transfer it from liters to gallons.
[02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:32.634]  No, you're letting local farmers be on Facebook.
[02:21:32.634 --> 02:21:35.136]  No, no, they're pissed by the EU, by the globalism.
[02:21:36.408 --> 02:21:39.570]  Who were talking during the break and you wanted to be very, very clear how you've been targeted.
[02:21:39.570 --> 02:21:49.537]  The listeners get that, but how you're targeted and how they do it is really like a skeleton key, a Rosetta Stone to unlock their future operations and what they're planning.
[02:21:49.537 --> 02:21:58.743]  And watching Google run circles around the Republicans and they're still, years later, debating whether there's internet censorship of conservatives.
[02:21:58.743 --> 02:22:01.665]  Well, here's how the lawyer game plays.
[02:22:01.665 --> 02:22:03.747]  They don't call it conservative, they call it hate.
[02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.711]  We don't censor conservative.
[02:22:07.711 --> 02:22:10.051]  That's not one of the terms.
[02:22:10.051 --> 02:22:14.212]  We just label all real conservatism as hate, and then we ban that.
[02:22:14.212 --> 02:22:21.393]  Just like Google, during the last election, listed all Republican candidates as Nazis, officially, in California.
[02:22:21.393 --> 02:22:22.574]  It's not an algorithm.
[02:22:22.574 --> 02:22:26.074]  They program it for what they want it to do.
[02:22:26.074 --> 02:22:27.034]  It's all admitted.
[02:22:27.034 --> 02:22:29.455]  And all these whistleblowers are coming out, Gavin McInnes.
[02:22:29.455 --> 02:22:34.036]  And so you wanted to clarify, and you also brought up Sandy Hook, which is an important point.
[02:22:35.655 --> 02:22:46.078]  Ever since that night, which was a setup, that was October 12th, I have been in the news every two days, every time I check my phone there's a new thing, a new thing I've been banned from, and it's systematic.
[02:22:46.078 --> 02:22:50.219]  Hey guys, please get the Penthouse magazine off my desk, please.
[02:22:50.219 --> 02:22:53.780]  I thought you had a Penthouse on your desk and you thought that's bad luck.
[02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:57.741]  No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not looking at the, it's only for the articles.
[02:22:57.741 --> 02:22:59.162]  I'm not going to interrupt, there's one I forgot.
[02:23:00.140 --> 02:23:01.161]  I was given it.
[02:23:01.161 --> 02:23:02.302]  It was actually delivered here.
[02:23:02.302 --> 02:23:04.683]  I guess they wanted me to have it.
[02:23:04.683 --> 02:23:06.705]  They had me in Penthouse this month.
[02:23:06.705 --> 02:23:08.886]  And of course, it's... Are you naked in it?
[02:23:08.886 --> 02:23:09.246]  No.
[02:23:09.246 --> 02:23:09.967]  Okay.
[02:23:09.967 --> 02:23:10.467]  Thank God.
[02:23:10.467 --> 02:23:12.689]  It's the standard statement, what you're talking about.
[02:23:12.689 --> 02:23:14.410]  So since you mentioned this, please bring it off my desk.
[02:23:14.410 --> 02:23:15.070]  Go ahead.
[02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:16.131]  So it's systemic.
[02:23:16.131 --> 02:23:17.592]  And it's boom, boom, boom.
[02:23:17.592 --> 02:23:18.273]  Every two days.
[02:23:18.273 --> 02:23:20.214]  Bang, bang, bang.
[02:23:20.214 --> 02:23:21.895]  The FBI says it's a hate group.
[02:23:21.895 --> 02:23:22.575]  Boo, boo, boo.
[02:23:22.575 --> 02:23:23.236]  It's like artillery.
[02:23:23.396 --> 02:23:25.276]  Yeah, it's like a Chinese water torture, too.
[02:23:25.276 --> 02:23:27.557]  They're just trying to break you down, break you down.
[02:23:27.557 --> 02:23:32.118]  And like with you with the Sandy Hook thing, you go, was that seven years ago?
[02:23:32.118 --> 02:23:33.278]  Why is this in the news now?
[02:23:33.278 --> 02:23:34.078]  Bang, bang.
[02:23:34.078 --> 02:23:46.341]  They are on a full offense for the next two years to make sure that they obliterate anyone who might help Trump because they cannot lose this election and they will kill people.
[02:23:46.641 --> 02:23:46.841]  I think?
[02:24:05.825 --> 02:24:12.629]  When they finally lose in 2020, the rioting on the streets is going to be brutal.
[02:24:12.629 --> 02:24:13.649]  I'm not exaggerating.
[02:24:13.649 --> 02:24:15.851]  I would say, don't be in the country.
[02:24:15.851 --> 02:24:22.775]  If you're a Republican, you're right-wing, I would say to you, don't be in the country on that day because
[02:24:23.855 --> 02:24:27.078]  We've already seen what happened in D.C.
[02:24:27.078 --> 02:24:28.899]  We've already seen these riots.
[02:24:28.899 --> 02:24:30.040]  These people are so unhinged.
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:31.841]  I just remembered something that was really crazy.
[02:24:31.841 --> 02:24:39.046]  So there's this Patriot guy, I forget his name, but he's in Philadelphia, and he says, I want to have a rally for the Constitution.
[02:24:39.046 --> 02:24:47.132]  Let's call it We the People, and we'll go there and we'll dress up like George Washington and stuff, and we'll have Liberty Bells, and we'll just say, let's get back to the Constitution.
[02:24:48.653 --> 02:24:50.654]  He does this, he announces this rally.
[02:24:50.654 --> 02:25:01.701]  The narrative becomes, Proud Boys are going to have a Nazi rally in front of the Jewish Museum to celebrate the synagogue sling.
[02:25:01.701 --> 02:25:04.162]  And you go, what?
[02:25:04.162 --> 02:25:04.523]  What?
[02:25:06.892 --> 02:25:13.315]  Like, in Germany in 1943, I bet Nazis would go, uh, that's a bit rich.
[02:25:13.315 --> 02:25:17.137]  Meanwhile, an actual Nazi is funding him, George Soros.
[02:25:17.137 --> 02:25:18.078]  Right.
[02:25:18.078 --> 02:25:22.180]  So the final event happens and they're all there screaming, we don't want Nazis in our town.
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:23.060]  You go, what?
[02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:25.181]  What are you talking about?
[02:25:25.181 --> 02:25:29.404]  Why would the mayor give a permit to Nazis to celebrate a synagogue shooting?
[02:25:29.404 --> 02:25:30.604]  That's insane!
[02:25:30.604 --> 02:25:33.646]  The left's followers want to buy into lies.
[02:25:34.617 --> 02:25:35.357]  Yeah, fun!
[02:25:35.357 --> 02:25:41.198]  Because they're not actually going out to face real Nazis, they're just showing up and just being hateful little bastards.
[02:25:41.198 --> 02:25:43.439]  Look, I think it goes back to the Freedom Riders.
[02:25:43.439 --> 02:25:46.539]  The Freedom Riders were inarguably cool.
[02:25:46.539 --> 02:25:54.220]  It was cool of them to go to the segregated South with blacks and whites and get the crap beat out of them and say, we're not going to stand up for segregation.
[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:56.241]  Sure, it was like, it was Gandhi-esque.
[02:25:56.241 --> 02:26:01.562]  Yeah, and they had suits on and bloody noses and I think people look at history books and they go, I wish I had a cause like that.
[02:26:01.562 --> 02:26:02.522]  And Charlton Heston was part of that.
[02:26:02.862 --> 02:26:03.763]  Oh, really?
[02:26:03.763 --> 02:26:06.204]  Well, okay, so, that was incredibly cool.
[02:26:06.204 --> 02:26:07.585]  Sorry, that's done now.
[02:26:07.585 --> 02:26:09.707]  America's not a racist hellhole anymore.
[02:26:09.707 --> 02:26:11.428]  There's no, you can't be a freedom fighter.
[02:26:11.428 --> 02:26:12.729]  You're not fighting Nazis.
[02:26:12.729 --> 02:26:14.350]  Our audience... Well, you're a Nazi!
[02:26:14.350 --> 02:26:17.833]  Our audience knows that, but here, let's go for TV Viewers' Penthouse Magazine.
[02:26:17.833 --> 02:26:20.815]  We're not going to show any of the horrible stuff here.
[02:26:20.815 --> 02:26:21.956]  We're Sharia-compliant.
[02:26:21.956 --> 02:26:23.057]  Document Cam Shot, please.
[02:26:24.037 --> 02:26:26.278]  But that is a nice creation of the good Lord.
[02:26:26.278 --> 02:26:34.281]  Now, I'm a big fan of God's artwork here, but let me go to the part that I'm in here.
[02:26:34.281 --> 02:26:36.822]  This is on the news today as well.
[02:26:36.822 --> 02:26:39.023]  We're turning the frogs gay.
[02:26:39.023 --> 02:26:40.563]  And somebody said XOXO.
[02:26:40.563 --> 02:26:45.365]  I don't know who even sent me this, but where's my pen?
[02:26:45.365 --> 02:26:47.006]  Now for TV viewers, here it is.
[02:26:47.006 --> 02:26:47.746]  Now when you read
[02:26:49.855 --> 02:26:56.799]  What they say about me here, it says, he says no one died at Sandy Hook and he won't apologize.
[02:26:56.799 --> 02:27:02.263]  And it goes on to, you know, say all these things about me that aren't true.
[02:27:02.263 --> 02:27:06.405]  In fact, on Twitter they said something different than they even say here.
[02:27:06.405 --> 02:27:07.846]  So they said less here.
[02:27:07.846 --> 02:27:10.748]  But it's always the same scripting.
[02:27:10.748 --> 02:27:12.029]  And then I get these calls.
[02:27:12.029 --> 02:27:12.909]  Yes, great point.
[02:27:12.909 --> 02:27:18.173]  I get these calls and the New York Times goes, will you apologize for saying no one died?
[02:27:19.113 --> 02:27:27.039]  And then I say, well, the internet questioned it and there were some anomalies, but three years ago I said I thought it happened.
[02:27:27.039 --> 02:27:29.221]  And then I sent them the videos and it's not the news.
[02:27:29.221 --> 02:27:33.624]  They were at a New York Times article saying Jones sent more people their houses.
[02:27:33.624 --> 02:27:36.366]  Even though we contacted him, he wouldn't stop.
[02:27:36.366 --> 02:27:41.910]  And so it's actually the media that keeps republishing this and then contacting families.
[02:27:43.635 --> 02:27:45.516]  And telling them I said things I didn't say.
[02:27:45.516 --> 02:27:56.621]  So this is the same example of how it happens over and over and over and over again because they looked at everything I ever said or did and they picked that.
[02:27:57.574 --> 02:28:12.243]  And they picked it because years ago I said, you know, even when I cover internet and people asking questions, I need to be clear that, you know, because they threw babies out of incubators and actually didn't do that, but said they did launch the Iraq war that killed millions.
[02:28:12.243 --> 02:28:15.225]  If there was more babies thrown out of incubators in another country, I'm going to have to question it.
[02:28:15.225 --> 02:28:18.607]  If it turns out the babies did get killed, I'll say, okay, well, they didn't get killed here.
[02:28:18.607 --> 02:28:19.107]  They did here.
[02:28:19.107 --> 02:28:19.827]  We have to question.
[02:28:19.827 --> 02:28:20.948]  That's normal.
[02:28:20.948 --> 02:28:22.149]  Like, you know, wag the dog, the movie.
[02:28:24.312 --> 02:28:29.596]  But they'll never let me say that because they just think that they basically pigeon-holed me.
[02:28:29.596 --> 02:28:34.380]  Yeah, and I'm glad you brought up that they use the same verbiage because that's a tip-off that this is all coming from one source.
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:34.861]  Oh, it's a script.
[02:28:34.861 --> 02:28:35.721]  I mean, they just put it out.
[02:28:35.721 --> 02:28:38.403]  It's like, you know, Jones is just bullied.
[02:28:38.403 --> 02:28:40.425]  And then they have the parents.
[02:28:40.425 --> 02:28:46.470]  They go to the graves of their kids and say, Alex just won't apologize.
[02:28:46.470 --> 02:28:47.511]  He just won't stop.
[02:28:47.511 --> 02:28:48.171]  So I do it again.
[02:28:48.171 --> 02:28:49.632]  I've done it like 150 times.
[02:28:49.632 --> 02:28:53.155]  I send them the videos and they just keep saying it.
[02:28:53.155 --> 02:28:53.816]  They just keep saying it.
[02:28:55.578 --> 02:28:59.420]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[02:28:59.420 --> 02:29:03.143]  It's creating 10.8 billion dollars in new wealth a year.
[02:29:03.143 --> 02:29:07.766]  And every day, it's transforming more and more Americans into millionaires.
[02:29:07.766 --> 02:29:13.649]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become one of them.

[02:31:57.409 --> 02:32:03.074]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:32:03.074 --> 02:32:06.196]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:32:06.196 --> 02:32:08.878]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:32:08.878 --> 02:32:13.162]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:32:13.162 --> 02:32:20.668]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:32:20.668 --> 02:32:23.090]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:32:26.514 --> 02:32:28.735]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:32:28.735 --> 02:32:29.615]  They called it U.N.
[02:32:29.615 --> 02:32:31.236]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[02:32:31.236 --> 02:32:31.756]  2030 Agenda.
[02:32:31.756 --> 02:32:43.682]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:32:43.682 --> 02:32:46.023]  It's the David Knight Show!
[02:32:46.023 --> 02:32:48.304]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:32:48.304 --> 02:32:48.904]  I mean, what?
[02:32:48.904 --> 02:32:49.484]  I mean, never!
[02:32:58.726 --> 02:33:08.613]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.613 --> 02:33:22.222]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:39.657 --> 02:33:45.121]  Now again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not reading this from the Twitter of Penthouse or from Penthouse Magazine.
[02:33:45.121 --> 02:33:47.783]  This is about us.
[02:33:47.783 --> 02:33:54.988]  I'm reading it because every article, I'm telling you, they've had 10,000 articles in a day before.
[02:33:54.988 --> 02:33:57.090]  Because when AP put something out, it's in every newspaper.
[02:33:57.090 --> 02:33:58.751]  So to say 10,000, it's way above that.
[02:33:58.751 --> 02:34:03.835]  I mean, I subscribed to LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters and stuff to look this up and
[02:34:06.122 --> 02:34:09.544]  Last year it was like a million stories.
[02:34:09.544 --> 02:34:11.025]  This year I didn't even look.
[02:34:11.025 --> 02:34:16.027]  I mean it's it's and it settled down some because they realized a lot of it backfired.
[02:34:16.027 --> 02:34:18.148]  But but let's just go over this.
[02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:19.749]  If you're a TV viewer you can see it.
[02:34:19.749 --> 02:34:21.410]  Please put the tweet back on screen.
[02:34:21.410 --> 02:34:22.570]  My eyes aren't what they used to be.
[02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:24.672]  And scroll down.
[02:34:24.672 --> 02:34:29.294]  This is from Penthouse and they put me in their Penthouse issue called Culture Wars.
[02:34:32.614 --> 02:34:36.676]  And again... Can I make something clear?
[02:34:36.676 --> 02:34:39.838]  Penthouse America is run by a lesbian.
[02:34:39.838 --> 02:34:41.839]  She doesn't like men.
[02:34:41.839 --> 02:34:43.380]  They're going bankrupt.
[02:34:43.380 --> 02:34:50.785]  And all she does is put in her lesbian friends and it has a feminist kind of a vibe to it now, which is making them bankrupt.
[02:34:50.785 --> 02:34:50.945]  I know!
[02:34:50.945 --> 02:34:52.746]  I was reading it earlier and it's how men are bad.
[02:34:53.561 --> 02:34:58.643]  Like, all they're doing is teaching women how to, like, not get into that whole area of power.
[02:34:58.643 --> 02:35:06.067]  Yeah, you're reading, basically, a feminist, lesbian, man-hating magazine, and it's Penthouse.
[02:35:06.067 --> 02:35:08.388]  So let's go back to it, because they put more stuff out in the tweet.
[02:35:08.388 --> 02:35:09.168]  Go ahead and scroll down, guys.
[02:35:13.097 --> 02:35:15.779]  Well, this is obviously a different tweet you guys have found.
[02:35:15.779 --> 02:35:16.840]  Let me read it off my phone.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.581]  The 50th time is the charm.
[02:35:18.581 --> 02:35:20.443]  No, no, it's not there at all.
[02:35:20.443 --> 02:35:23.205]  The 50th time is the charm.
[02:35:23.205 --> 02:35:27.908]  So I will now read this the 50th time that I tried to get this.
[02:35:27.908 --> 02:35:29.470]  So here you go.
[02:35:29.470 --> 02:35:34.514]  It says, despite having the net worth of a top tier Victoria's Secret model,
[02:35:35.214 --> 02:35:37.215]  I guess that shows the woman, right, is obsessed with models.
[02:35:37.215 --> 02:35:37.796]  That's not even true.
[02:35:37.796 --> 02:35:40.277]  Someone's going to make like $20 million a year.
[02:35:40.277 --> 02:35:42.118]  Infowars mogul.
[02:35:42.118 --> 02:35:43.098]  See, that's their new angle.
[02:35:43.098 --> 02:35:44.779]  I'm this mogul.
[02:35:44.779 --> 02:35:46.921]  Alex Jones is not happy with America.
[02:35:46.921 --> 02:35:48.241]  No, I love America.
[02:35:48.241 --> 02:35:51.463]  It's the Democrats saying we can't even say America exists.
[02:35:51.463 --> 02:36:01.329]  After years of spewing crazy conspiracy theories and so-called insider government information about chemtrails, total geoengineering is admitted, Jones was recently booted from all social media platforms.
[02:36:02.029 --> 02:36:08.674]  Twitter initially let Jones stay in the game, but then big ol' dumb-dumb flew from Texas to Washington D.C.
[02:36:08.674 --> 02:36:11.636]  to scream at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's face.
[02:36:11.636 --> 02:36:16.819]  Yeah, Dorsey said, despite the fact that Alex has killed the media, which I didn't say, I'll leave him on.
[02:36:16.819 --> 02:36:19.801]  That's how stupid I think you are.
[02:36:19.801 --> 02:36:22.743]  A brilliant move that predictably backfired.
[02:36:22.743 --> 02:36:25.105]  No, I don't kiss their butt to stay on their platform.
[02:36:25.105 --> 02:36:29.088]  Instead of admitting his own faults, and that he may, just may,
[02:36:31.627 --> 02:36:36.189]  Have taken it a bit too far with his claim that government was turning frogs gay with estrogen.
[02:36:36.189 --> 02:36:37.310]  That's all over the news.
[02:36:37.310 --> 02:36:39.911]  Jones was whipped like a puppy dog.
[02:36:39.911 --> 02:36:54.039]  And all that has happened as his refused to apologize, which that's not even true, for calling Sandy Hook Elementary School a hoax and encouraging his fans to attack the parents, well I'll put a link to this, of the victims.
[02:36:54.039 --> 02:37:00.162]  Like his daddy, Donald Trump, Jones cries victim while monetizing one of the biggest
[02:37:00.822 --> 02:37:03.127]  Bully pulpits of the web.
[02:37:03.127 --> 02:37:08.880]  But hey, not even Jack Dorsey can stop him from selling Patriot Pantry pizza.
[02:37:10.871 --> 02:37:14.493]  First of all, that does not sound like a men's magazine writer.
[02:37:14.493 --> 02:37:16.214]  That sounds like a feminist writer.
[02:37:16.214 --> 02:37:24.080]  Secondly, this notion that you're this sort of wizard, the man behind the curtain, who is sending people to homes to harass them.
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:24.820]  I got that too.
[02:37:24.820 --> 02:37:30.904]  They said, he lives in the wealthy suburbs, but commands these proud boys to go and attack people.
[02:37:30.904 --> 02:37:32.085]  Because that's the left.
[02:37:32.085 --> 02:37:33.406]  They're old for rich commanding.
[02:37:33.406 --> 02:37:36.047]  You made a great point last night that was really smart.
[02:37:36.047 --> 02:37:37.268]  Make that again.
[02:37:37.268 --> 02:37:39.870]  You said you have the big billionaire globalists.
[02:37:41.184 --> 02:37:48.250]  At the tech companies, and then they have the newspapers put lies out about us that are millionaires, and then they send the meth-head Antifa after us.
[02:37:48.250 --> 02:37:49.992]  And then it's crazy.
[02:37:49.992 --> 02:37:53.415]  And then everything they say about us is them.
[02:37:53.415 --> 02:37:57.118]  I'm really becoming red-pilled.
[02:37:57.118 --> 02:38:05.586]  My eyes are opening more than ever this past year, because I used to just think there's Antifa, and then there's the media has left and right, and then there's the government.
[02:38:05.586 --> 02:38:07.487]  It's all the same team.
[02:38:08.388 --> 02:38:11.510]  And I've had... Oh, Fox News puts out the same talking points again.
[02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:19.054]  I've been trying to get Proud Boys out of jail and the media will find out details about their case before the lawyers do.
[02:38:19.054 --> 02:38:21.456]  And you go, or when I was banned from Australia.
[02:38:21.456 --> 02:38:24.838]  Why did the media know I was banned from Australia before my immigration lawyer?
[02:38:24.838 --> 02:38:27.900]  All the corporate media knew when I was banned on my apps or everything.
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:33.382]  Six, seven hours before, and they would all have a D-Day, and they'd all publish at an exact time.
[02:38:33.382 --> 02:38:33.903]  They all agreed.
[02:38:33.903 --> 02:38:37.204]  No one publishes, and then thousands would publish at one minute.
[02:38:37.204 --> 02:38:39.465]  And then I would be told by that.
[02:38:39.465 --> 02:38:48.010]  Why was Cuomo going with the alt-right hate gang minutes after, or, sorry, immediately after there was an attack, and then Bill de Blasio, the Attorney General, boom, boom, boom.
[02:38:48.010 --> 02:38:56.154]  When I got banned, when my Apple app got banned, because they called for it, there were over a thousand articles published the same minute.
[02:38:57.918 --> 02:39:00.502]  And some of these were like five pages long.
[02:39:00.502 --> 02:39:02.365]  They'd all gotten the news the day before.
[02:39:02.365 --> 02:39:03.247]  They'd all written it.
[02:39:03.247 --> 02:39:04.068]  They'd all agreed.
[02:39:04.068 --> 02:39:06.833]  They're all in these dashboard interfaces, brigading.
[02:39:08.117 --> 02:39:12.280]  You know, that's kind of a good thing about Twitter, where you can start seeing who these people are.
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:18.524]  And I didn't know this, but a lot of prosecutors in court, especially in New York, are social justice warriors.
[02:39:18.524 --> 02:39:18.864]  Oh yeah!
[02:39:18.864 --> 02:39:23.728]  And you read their Twitter feed, and it's all about Trump has to die, and you're like, this is blind justice!
[02:39:23.728 --> 02:39:25.189]  This is the people holding the scales!
[02:39:25.189 --> 02:39:31.753]  New York's new prosecutor coming in, the head prosecutor says, I'm gonna take his family down.
[02:39:31.753 --> 02:39:33.795]  Used to, you would lose your job as bias right there.
[02:39:34.958 --> 02:39:43.424]  I was so naive about the justice system, and I, the more I look at it, because Proud Boys has got me involved in law, and I've been talking to lawyers and seeing judges.
[02:39:43.424 --> 02:39:52.010]  We got a judge in New York who defecated her chair and then complained that no one's got her a new chair.
[02:39:52.010 --> 02:39:54.711]  They're not sending their bastards further.
[02:39:54.711 --> 02:39:56.573]  I'm not going to get into inside baseball.
[02:39:57.549 --> 02:40:03.333]  But you've seen, you've seen all these big battles that take my kids away with the media got involved in.
[02:40:03.333 --> 02:40:06.816]  I mean, there would be custody battles where you would have 50 members of the media.
[02:40:06.816 --> 02:40:07.796]  I'm 50.
[02:40:07.796 --> 02:40:10.278]  New York Times, Washington Post, BuzzFeed.
[02:40:10.278 --> 02:40:13.701]  And when they would have reporters
[02:40:16.107 --> 02:40:17.208]  Go out and write total lies.
[02:40:17.208 --> 02:40:20.652]  I'd come to him and I'd say, you saw what was said in court, right?
[02:40:20.652 --> 02:40:23.836]  And you saw what the jury actually said, and they didn't care.
[02:40:23.836 --> 02:40:26.960]  As a wall, they all lied about the verdict.
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:29.363]  They all lied about what was said.
[02:40:29.363 --> 02:40:30.744]  And it was the discipline.
[02:40:31.405 --> 02:40:33.406]  How unified they are!
[02:40:33.406 --> 02:40:35.768]  Journalists are activists now.
[02:40:35.768 --> 02:40:42.993]  The whole notion of the Watergate guys with their sleeves rolled up and staying at the headquarters all night, you know, eating a pizza.
[02:40:42.993 --> 02:40:44.734]  I think I have a scoop!
[02:40:44.734 --> 02:40:49.177]  No, plagiarism isn't accepted, it's demanded.
[02:40:49.177 --> 02:40:51.599]  They just get their order, they rewrite it.
[02:40:52.399 --> 02:40:53.521]  And then it comes out.
[02:40:53.521 --> 02:40:54.642]  It's a PR firm.
[02:40:54.642 --> 02:40:55.784]  They are publicists.
[02:40:55.784 --> 02:40:56.785]  And they work for the DNC.
[02:40:56.785 --> 02:41:02.313]  And I, in the past two months, have learned so much about the cohesion.
[02:41:02.313 --> 02:41:03.254]  They talk about collusion all the time.
[02:41:03.254 --> 02:41:03.395]  Gavin!
[02:41:03.395 --> 02:41:03.515]  Gavin!
[02:41:03.515 --> 02:41:03.895]  Gavin!
[02:41:03.895 --> 02:41:04.636]  Gavin!
[02:41:04.636 --> 02:41:06.539]  I have my children 80% of the time.
[02:41:08.101 --> 02:41:13.802]  I walked down the street with my children, and people go, F you, glad you lost your family.
[02:41:13.802 --> 02:41:20.024]  And these two gay guys, because they told me they were gay, when I was coming back from Colorado last year, they had a snowboarding championship there.
[02:41:20.024 --> 02:41:23.565]  These big guys come on the plane, they go, F you, Jones, glad you lost your family.
[02:41:23.565 --> 02:41:25.745]  And I'm sitting there with all my kids, I said, do you mind?
[02:41:25.745 --> 02:41:26.565]  This is my family.
[02:41:26.565 --> 02:41:29.386]  My new wife, my four children, one with her.
[02:41:29.386 --> 02:41:32.707]  And when we get off the plane, they try to start a fight with my son at the baggage claim.
[02:41:32.707 --> 02:41:34.447]  He was 15 then.
[02:41:34.447 --> 02:41:37.188]  And they literally, they're literally there in my face.
[02:41:38.698 --> 02:41:40.960]  And I go, see, I have my family.
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:43.082]  He goes, well, then F your family.
[02:41:43.082 --> 02:41:50.689]  So that's how sick the left is, is that they were literally, they don't know what to do because they don't know my kids and my super gorgeous wife.
[02:41:50.689 --> 02:41:52.451]  And they just and my kids all are great.
[02:41:52.451 --> 02:41:53.792]  And they crap themselves.
[02:41:53.792 --> 02:41:56.774]  You know what bloods do when they see a crip with his kids?
[02:41:56.774 --> 02:41:58.076]  They go, oh, God.
[02:41:58.656 --> 02:41:59.937]  Maybe I'll get him later.
[02:41:59.937 --> 02:42:00.937]  You know what the mob does?
[02:42:00.937 --> 02:42:05.379]  You know what organized gangsters, criminals do when they see an opponent with his kids?
[02:42:05.379 --> 02:42:09.041]  They go, oh, I guess I'll... Why was he with his kids?
[02:42:09.041 --> 02:42:13.864]  It was a left attack, that's when they... But yeah, so they have less scruples than Bloods and Crips.
[02:42:13.864 --> 02:42:22.288]  Gangbangers are more moral than these political activists who are out there... Oh, they followed my son because he already got the bag and tried to start a fight with him.
[02:42:24.173 --> 02:42:24.874]  For what?
[02:42:24.874 --> 02:42:25.934]  Is that going to be good footage?
[02:42:25.934 --> 02:42:28.016]  Now, Alex Jones' son, violent attack.
[02:42:28.016 --> 02:42:29.457]  Like, that's exactly what they did.
[02:42:29.457 --> 02:42:32.859]  But my son already loved me and did whatever I told him, way better than I was.
[02:42:32.859 --> 02:42:37.162]  But that kind of crap now has him, like, worshipful.
[02:42:37.162 --> 02:42:39.503]  It's actually not even, but that's the persecution, didn't it?
[02:42:39.503 --> 02:42:41.004]  I don't think other fathers have that.
[02:42:41.004 --> 02:42:42.105]  Yeah, my wife is a liberal.
[02:42:42.105 --> 02:42:43.286]  I don't think she's a liberal anymore.
[02:42:43.286 --> 02:42:44.206]  She voted for Hillary.
[02:42:44.206 --> 02:42:45.547]  I think they converted her.
[02:42:45.547 --> 02:42:49.710]  Good work, guys.
[02:42:49.710 --> 02:42:50.310]  We're going to win, though.
[02:42:50.310 --> 02:42:52.372]  I just think that my kids truly deserve to win.
[02:42:55.177 --> 02:43:04.227]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[02:43:04.227 --> 02:43:05.568]  We've been proven dead on.

[02:43:14.078 --> 02:43:15.139]  Words are not enough.
[02:43:15.945 --> 02:43:22.133]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[02:43:22.133 --> 02:43:28.341]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[02:43:28.341 --> 02:43:31.686]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[02:43:32.315 --> 02:43:34.236]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[02:43:34.236 --> 02:43:38.737]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globally anti-human future.
[02:43:38.737 --> 02:43:44.498]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.

[02:45:38.778 --> 02:45:42.320]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history.
[02:46:03.487 --> 02:46:04.988]  That wants to hurt children.
[02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:06.109]  They want to abort children.
[02:46:06.109 --> 02:46:07.871]  They want to disease children.
[02:46:07.871 --> 02:46:08.992]  They want to abuse children.
[02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:10.614]  They want to confuse children.
[02:46:10.614 --> 02:46:11.775]  They want their essence.
[02:46:11.775 --> 02:46:12.736]  They want their soul.
[02:46:12.736 --> 02:46:14.057]  They want their spirit.
[02:46:14.057 --> 02:46:15.838]  They want their power.
[02:46:15.838 --> 02:46:18.060]  Because they are our future.
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:21.724]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[02:46:21.724 --> 02:46:23.546]  It is about the West.
[02:46:23.546 --> 02:46:27.709]  And it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[02:46:27.709 --> 02:46:29.271]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[02:46:30.467 --> 02:46:40.990]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:43.051]  You have the power to override the censors.
[02:46:43.051 --> 02:46:46.152]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[02:46:46.152 --> 02:46:55.195]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[02:46:59.750 --> 02:47:17.721]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.721 --> 02:47:23.064]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:23.064 --> 02:47:28.247]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[02:47:39.693 --> 02:47:54.562]  Alright, we're going 15 minutes to the next hour and then Hagman and Hagman are taking over and then there's a war room.
[02:47:54.562 --> 02:47:59.965]  Gavin will pop back in on that.
[02:48:07.509 --> 02:48:09.632]  I'm gonna plug right now or we're gonna go bankrupt.
[02:48:09.632 --> 02:48:11.794]  I look like Don Imus, don't I?
[02:48:11.794 --> 02:48:12.275]  Please don't.
[02:48:12.275 --> 02:48:13.316]  No, you don't look like Don Imus.
[02:48:13.316 --> 02:48:15.799]  I look like Don Imus if he was a mammal.
[02:48:15.799 --> 02:48:16.640]  A furry mammal.
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:18.522]  Yeah, instead of like a reptoid.
[02:48:18.522 --> 02:48:20.004]  Let's get serious though.
[02:48:20.004 --> 02:48:20.385]  Listeners?
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:24.482]  I need your support.
[02:48:24.482 --> 02:48:25.603]  You know that.
[02:48:25.603 --> 02:48:28.387]  And I'm trying to build a bigger thing with more reporters, more people.
[02:48:28.387 --> 02:48:29.728]  I'm fighting.
[02:48:29.728 --> 02:48:38.359]  And I'm not complaining when we get attacked, but I sell really awesome products at the lowest prices you're going to find them.
[02:48:38.359 --> 02:48:40.662]  I go out and find out what is the hottest thing.
[02:48:42.327 --> 02:48:45.289]  What is got the best ratings?
[02:48:45.289 --> 02:48:47.170]  What's got the best testing?
[02:48:47.170 --> 02:48:51.594]  And then I call up the manufacturer and I say, give me a chance.
[02:48:51.594 --> 02:48:53.435]  I'm going to be your biggest distributor.
[02:48:53.435 --> 02:48:56.097]  I want the lowest map pricing you've ever given.
[02:48:57.492 --> 02:49:01.574]  And I do it on storable food, I do it on water filters, I do it on air filters.
[02:49:01.574 --> 02:49:03.515]  And I've learned doing this 24 years on air.
[02:49:03.515 --> 02:49:05.977]  You know, I knew water filters were big with people in the Liberty Movement.
[02:49:05.977 --> 02:49:07.618]  I was already having them.
[02:49:07.618 --> 02:49:13.341]  And then the filters would get crappy, even though it was a good, all of a sudden it was like, they go into the phase of just making money.
[02:49:13.341 --> 02:49:16.343]  And I'd say, I'm not carrying your filter anymore to a major company.
[02:49:16.343 --> 02:49:18.764]  Everybody knows their name.
[02:49:18.764 --> 02:49:20.285]  Because I got complaints and I didn't like it.
[02:49:20.285 --> 02:49:21.986]  And I was like, I was using it myself.
[02:49:21.986 --> 02:49:23.847]  So I went out and found the very best company out there.
[02:49:25.299 --> 02:49:26.661]  And there are a couple others that are really good as well.
[02:49:26.661 --> 02:49:29.744]  So whatever's good, we sell it.
[02:49:29.744 --> 02:49:35.791]  And you heard me with the Alexa Pure Pro, big stainless steel gravity filter, leading competitors, $300, $400.
[02:49:35.791 --> 02:49:38.694]  It's $247 usually.
[02:49:38.694 --> 02:49:40.757]  I told you, I said it's year-end, they want to sell it.
[02:49:40.757 --> 02:49:41.998]  Exodus Inventory, $126.
[02:49:41.998 --> 02:49:42.879]  We made $33 on each one.
[02:49:47.344 --> 02:49:49.105]  No one ever had one of those at that price.
[02:49:49.105 --> 02:49:50.346]  It's the best filtration.
[02:49:50.346 --> 02:49:52.788]  Cuts all the bad stuff, leaves in the good minerals.
[02:49:52.788 --> 02:49:56.872]  So I told you, Alexa Pure Breeze is their four-stage ion filtration.
[02:49:56.872 --> 02:49:59.854]  Leading competitors used to be $800 when it first came out.
[02:49:59.854 --> 02:50:05.058]  Now because the market, you know, Alexa Pure Breeze used to be $400, now they're $250.
[02:50:05.058 --> 02:50:09.722]  Because prices go down, technology gets cheaper.
[02:50:09.722 --> 02:50:12.104]  It's $126 again.
[02:50:12.104 --> 02:50:13.765]  These will sell out by this weekend.
[02:50:15.382 --> 02:50:16.762]  One of them does a really big room.
[02:50:16.762 --> 02:50:18.863]  Couple of them will do a small house.
[02:50:18.863 --> 02:50:21.303]  I've got them in every room of this office.
[02:50:21.303 --> 02:50:22.164]  I've got them everywhere.
[02:50:22.164 --> 02:50:26.345]  You just take off the filter every few months, wipe it off, wash it off.
[02:50:26.345 --> 02:50:29.165]  When it's picking up stuff in the room, let me tell you how accurate these are.
[02:50:29.165 --> 02:50:31.126]  I don't want to be gross, but it's true.
[02:50:31.126 --> 02:50:34.346]  I have one in the garage where I work out.
[02:50:34.346 --> 02:50:40.468]  And if someone passes gas 20 feet away from it, it goes from blue to red in one second.
[02:50:40.468 --> 02:50:41.748]  The sensor's incredible.
[02:50:42.858 --> 02:50:43.098]  I think?
[02:51:04.933 --> 02:51:08.275]  Because it's year-end, Soros is trying to take our payment processes away.
[02:51:08.275 --> 02:51:09.355]  He got us down to one.
[02:51:09.355 --> 02:51:11.156]  We got a few backups now, but I'm not.
[02:51:11.156 --> 02:51:14.517]  I'm like, look, I usually keep six months ahead of supply.
[02:51:14.517 --> 02:51:15.438]  Not anymore because of this.
[02:51:15.438 --> 02:51:17.238]  We're going to keep it one month of supply.
[02:51:17.238 --> 02:51:20.760]  We're selling every t-shirt, every book, every film, you name it.
[02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:21.780]  Free t-shirt, 50 to 75% off.
[02:51:24.116 --> 02:51:27.037]  Storewide, double Patriot points for your next order.
[02:51:27.037 --> 02:51:31.799]  So if you spend 50 bucks, you get 10% on your next order instead of 5%.
[02:51:31.799 --> 02:51:33.920]  It's this huge rewards program.
[02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:38.162]  Free shipping storewide, the free t-shirt, and the big bestseller we had sold out.
[02:51:38.162 --> 02:51:40.903]  So now it's a grab bag of all our other shirts to sell of the year.
[02:51:40.903 --> 02:51:42.023]  So it'll be a mystery shirt.
[02:51:42.023 --> 02:51:43.364]  You just say your size, you'll get one.
[02:51:44.284 --> 02:51:48.147]  Most of these orders lose $10, but I end up basically paying that in taxes.
[02:51:48.147 --> 02:51:49.688]  So we're all working together.
[02:51:49.688 --> 02:51:50.669]  We're getting a great deal.
[02:51:50.669 --> 02:51:51.770]  Don't fight the traffic.
[02:51:51.770 --> 02:51:53.111]  Don't fight the crowds.
[02:51:53.111 --> 02:51:55.693]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:51:55.693 --> 02:51:56.894]  Put a note on your order.
[02:51:56.894 --> 02:51:58.175]  You can deliver it to friends and family.
[02:51:58.175 --> 02:52:01.778]  Hey, here's your Christmas present from Alex Jones, but put the note on there.
[02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:06.322]  So they open the, you know, put their name on the order and then put the name on the receipts.
[02:52:06.322 --> 02:52:08.203]  They know they got it because sometimes that stuff gets sent back.
[02:52:08.203 --> 02:52:11.486]  People don't know why they got sent a water filter or a book or a t-shirt or whatever.
[02:52:12.105 --> 02:52:14.514]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:52:18.081 --> 02:52:29.209]  I want to open the phones up for the next two segments for Gavin McInnes to ask your questions, to make your statements, to do whatever you want to do.
[02:52:29.209 --> 02:52:30.170]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[02:52:30.170 --> 02:52:32.431]  Specifically, Gavin McInnes.
[02:52:32.431 --> 02:52:37.735]  For Proud Boys, go to the front of the line, Patriots, law enforcement, whoever, just let us know who you are.
[02:52:37.735 --> 02:52:39.756]  We'll go right to your calls.
[02:52:39.756 --> 02:52:41.137]  877-789-2539.
[02:52:41.137 --> 02:52:43.599]  Now, you get me wound up, so I've been interrupting a lot.
[02:52:43.599 --> 02:52:46.201]  You've made a lot of good points, but for the rest of this segment, you've got the floor
[02:52:48.345 --> 02:52:50.267]  What else would you like to add?
[02:52:50.267 --> 02:52:53.029]  I'd like to add something.
[02:52:53.029 --> 02:52:57.053]  This is a good example of the war on men.
[02:52:57.053 --> 02:53:05.821]  This is a magazine that was supposed to be a men's magazine and they gave it to a lesbian who clearly doesn't like men at all and she's ruining it.
[02:53:05.821 --> 02:53:07.722]  From a penthouse that's demonizing me.
[02:53:07.722 --> 02:53:08.923]  Penthouse America, yeah.
[02:53:08.923 --> 02:53:10.305]  Can't men celebrate women?
[02:53:10.825 --> 02:53:13.286]  Penthouse Australia is still really cool.
[02:53:13.286 --> 02:53:24.349]  But the real problem with the Proud Boys, besides the whole Trump thing, and they make Trump look fun, and they threaten Antifa, for some reason you're not allowed to have a men's club anymore.
[02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:26.810]  They used to be everywhere.
[02:53:26.810 --> 02:53:30.070]  The Elks Lodge and the Shriners.
[02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:33.311]  Every dad went to his men's club after work.
[02:53:33.311 --> 02:53:35.712]  And you don't see that anymore.
[02:53:35.712 --> 02:53:38.553]  You look at the way Homer Simpson is depicted in The Simpsons.
[02:53:39.173 --> 02:53:43.456]  Every married with children, every father figure since the 70s is an idiot.
[02:53:43.456 --> 02:53:44.577]  They're demoralizing us.
[02:53:44.577 --> 02:53:45.558]  It's declassified.
[02:53:45.558 --> 02:53:46.578]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:53:46.578 --> 02:53:49.400]  This is the leftist CIA trying to break our families up.
[02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:50.281]  It's outrageous.
[02:53:50.281 --> 02:53:53.183]  But what I love is how the NFL's going bankrupt.
[02:53:53.183 --> 02:53:54.324]  Hollywood's losing money.
[02:53:54.324 --> 02:53:56.225]  Everything that does this, people turn away from.
[02:53:56.225 --> 02:53:56.925]  It's beautiful.
[02:53:56.925 --> 02:53:58.306]  So now they've resorted to censorship.
[02:53:58.306 --> 02:53:59.027]  Sorry, I thought you had the floor.
[02:53:59.307 --> 02:54:00.949]  No, no.
[02:54:00.949 --> 02:54:02.190]  I like to watch action movies.
[02:54:02.190 --> 02:54:04.311]  Back when I had a job, I would go to D.C.
[02:54:04.311 --> 02:54:05.392]  and I'd be on the train.
[02:54:05.392 --> 02:54:12.758]  And if you're renting a movie, you don't want to get like a rom-com, because then the guy's sitting next to you and he sees like two people kissing.
[02:54:12.758 --> 02:54:13.659]  It's not a good look.
[02:54:13.659 --> 02:54:18.403]  So I only get action movies when I travel, because if other people see me, they see cool stuff.
[02:54:19.003 --> 02:54:20.064]  That's a good point.
[02:54:20.064 --> 02:54:27.649]  You don't want to get an R-rated love story or something because someone's walking by you on the train and they just see like two naked people.
[02:54:27.649 --> 02:54:29.230]  No, I just want action.
[02:54:29.230 --> 02:54:34.353]  And every single movie has been ruined by these badass, kick-ass chicks.
[02:54:34.353 --> 02:54:35.594]  Like, I watched one the other day.
[02:54:35.594 --> 02:54:39.697]  No, that was an order seven years ago that every hero has to be a woman.
[02:54:40.157 --> 02:54:42.558]  They wanted to make James Bond a black woman now.
[02:54:42.558 --> 02:54:45.238]  And I was watching this movie... Ghostbusters!
[02:54:45.238 --> 02:54:46.319]  Ghostbusters they ruined.
[02:54:46.319 --> 02:54:54.901]  These guys are robbing a bank, the Federal Reserve, during a hurricane, during a major environmental disaster, right?
[02:54:54.901 --> 02:54:57.362]  Guess who kicks their ass and stops them?
[02:54:57.362 --> 02:55:03.744]  Some chick who is about half the size of my daughter, like some little woman, is there
[02:55:04.464 --> 02:55:08.906]  Presumably, if you're robbing the Federal Reserve, you're in some of the top echelons of crime.
[02:55:08.906 --> 02:55:15.328]  Like, these guys were ex-Marines, Navy SEALs, and they had been to prison, and she busts the case open?
[02:55:15.328 --> 02:55:16.369]  Come on!
[02:55:16.369 --> 02:55:23.291]  Listen, my buddy Shane Steiner, as a super heart, you know, his whole family are world champion bull riders, you name it.
[02:55:23.291 --> 02:55:30.174]  We are at main event where you can play pool and bowl with our kids, and his wife's a beauty queen.
[02:55:31.041 --> 02:55:32.522]  Okay, I'm with my kids, my wife's not there.
[02:55:32.522 --> 02:55:47.052]  I'm with my kids, his kids, and we're playing pool, and there's these two lesbians, and I'm not against them, I like women, I like women too, but they both got duck-ass haircuts, look like grease, and they've got cigarettes in white t-shirts under their arms.
[02:55:47.052 --> 02:55:49.734]  They do a parody of straight people from the 50s.
[02:55:49.734 --> 02:56:00.841]  And they're wearing blue jeans, so one girl is like 5'4 and the pretty girl, and the other girl is like 5'3, 5'4, and has a duck-ass haircut, and they actually walk over and start hitting on Amy,
[02:56:01.762 --> 02:56:03.443]  And Amy is like a fitness model.
[02:56:03.443 --> 02:56:05.505]  She's like won national championships.
[02:56:05.505 --> 02:56:07.687]  And Amy starts laughing at him.
[02:56:07.687 --> 02:56:11.391]  And these women go, got a problem to shame who I've witnessed.
[02:56:11.391 --> 02:56:12.932]  We wasn't even showing off.
[02:56:12.932 --> 02:56:16.656]  You know, he's not shooting 45s into his pool with a silencer.
[02:56:16.656 --> 02:56:19.218]  He literally can bench press 400 pounds 25 times.
[02:56:21.991 --> 02:56:22.772]  He's a beast.
[02:56:22.772 --> 02:56:23.272]  He's a beast.
[02:56:23.272 --> 02:56:25.614]  I mean he trains, you know, and actually beats sometimes Tim Kennedy.
[02:56:25.614 --> 02:56:27.315]  That's what they train and grapple him.
[02:56:27.315 --> 02:56:32.339]  So this guy literally, like all these people try to come compete with him and they can't go as long as he can.
[02:56:32.339 --> 02:56:33.179]  So he's like the real deal.
[02:56:33.179 --> 02:56:34.340]  Genetic super freak.
[02:56:34.340 --> 02:56:35.261]  Yeah.
[02:56:35.261 --> 02:56:38.363]  And these women try to start a fight with him.
[02:56:38.363 --> 02:56:38.564]  Yeah.
[02:56:38.564 --> 02:56:41.266]  I'm literally, and Amy started laughing.
[02:56:41.266 --> 02:56:43.868]  They're saying Saunders like Conan the Barbarian what he wanted to look like.
[02:56:44.528 --> 02:56:50.093]  He looks meaner than Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime, and these women are literally trying to start a fight with him in some weird ritual.
[02:56:50.093 --> 02:56:52.255]  Like you said, like, they believe these movies.
[02:56:52.255 --> 02:56:54.016]  They're dealing with a dude that would rip your face off.
[02:56:54.016 --> 02:56:56.078]  Feminism hasn't glorified women.
[02:56:56.078 --> 02:56:58.720]  They look down on Housewives as sellouts.
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:04.365]  What they've done... Oh, no, no, no, this little short chick was bossing the other one around, like they think, like, smashing him, you know.
[02:57:04.545 --> 02:57:08.409]  What they've done is they've turned women into men, and women make crappy men.
[02:57:08.409 --> 02:57:10.851]  Sorry, ladies, you're not good at being us.
[02:57:10.851 --> 02:57:13.153]  We're a different gender, in case you haven't checked.
[02:57:13.153 --> 02:57:16.296]  So now they watch these after-movies... Yeah, but like, we're not men compared to Shane Steiner.
[02:57:16.296 --> 02:57:16.616]  Yeah.
[02:57:16.616 --> 02:57:18.738]  I mean, it's like, this is like the alpha male.
[02:57:18.738 --> 02:57:19.699]  Yes.
[02:57:19.699 --> 02:57:23.022]  So they go out and they see these movies and then they go, I'm a badass.
[02:57:23.022 --> 02:57:29.127]  And they go to rallies, like in the Rufio shot where that guy gets knocked out, you see this 100-pound girl going up to him like, what now?
[02:57:29.127 --> 02:57:30.969]  And they always, they act kind of like black
[02:57:31.369 --> 02:57:34.030]  Oh, let's come back and she starts punching the dude.
[02:57:34.030 --> 02:57:36.191]  She's like, yo, what's up?
[02:57:36.191 --> 02:57:37.592]  And you're like, lady, please.
[02:57:37.592 --> 02:57:40.213]  You ain't in Hollywood now, baby.
[02:57:40.213 --> 02:57:40.993]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:40.993 --> 02:57:42.513]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.219 --> 02:57:55.810]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:57:55.810 --> 02:57:57.872]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:57:57.872 --> 02:58:00.735]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:58:00.735 --> 02:58:01.936]  It's made in the USA.
[02:58:02.517 --> 02:58:02.797]  I think?
[02:58:25.919 --> 02:58:37.647]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:58:37.647 --> 02:58:40.949]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:58:40.949 --> 02:58:44.552]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:46.317 --> 02:58:50.580]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:50.580 --> 02:58:54.042]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:54.042 --> 02:58:55.824]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:55.824 --> 02:58:59.086]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:59.086 --> 02:59:05.870]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:05.870 --> 02:59:10.954]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:59:11.394 --> 02:59:17.400]  The globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.400 --> 02:59:20.383]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.383 --> 02:59:21.464]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.464 --> 02:59:25.308]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.308 --> 02:59:27.330]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:27.330 --> 02:59:28.611]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:28.611 --> 02:59:31.353]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.353 --> 02:59:33.776]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.256 --> 02:59:35.397]  I will never falter.
[02:59:35.397 --> 02:59:37.920]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:37.920 --> 02:59:38.861]  I physically will.
[02:59:38.861 --> 02:59:49.311]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then forwardstore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:49.311 --> 02:59:51.934]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.745 --> 03:00:13.868]  When you look at Antifa and you look at some of these groups, these are violent people.
[03:00:13.868 --> 03:00:15.268]  We'll have a little bit more here in a second.
[03:00:15.268 --> 03:00:17.149]  Michael, you know where he's trafficking.
[03:00:17.149 --> 03:00:20.070]  He's trafficking in this part of the Republican base.
[03:00:20.070 --> 03:00:22.511]  It's not fair to call it the Republican base, although that's what it is now.
[03:00:22.511 --> 03:00:29.914]  But I think, in fairness to you, the Trump voters, he's trafficking in their conspiracies.
[03:00:29.914 --> 03:00:30.254]  Yeah.
[03:00:30.254 --> 03:00:31.715]  And he touched Antifa.
[03:00:32.835 --> 03:00:42.379]  This reminds me a lot of his initial reaction to Charlottesville.
[03:00:42.379 --> 03:00:49.281]  This desire to talk about violence on the left as somehow equal to or perhaps greater than violence on the right.
[03:00:49.281 --> 03:00:51.462]  Or to rationalize violence!
[03:00:51.462 --> 03:00:53.303]  I think he just wants to rationalize violence.
[03:00:58.126 --> 03:01:02.148]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the n-word?
[03:01:02.148 --> 03:01:07.331]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[03:01:07.331 --> 03:01:10.693]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[03:01:10.693 --> 03:01:15.116]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[03:01:15.116 --> 03:01:16.457]  I wouldn't support that group.
[03:01:16.457 --> 03:01:16.797]  Would you?
[03:01:16.797 --> 03:01:24.061]  This has been a public service announcement from InfoWars.com Antifa!
[03:02:00.916 --> 03:02:02.318]  If you're a TV viewer, you saw it.
[03:02:02.318 --> 03:02:03.719]  Radio listeners missed it.
[03:02:03.719 --> 03:02:05.902]  This footage, and we have some more in D.C.
[03:02:05.902 --> 03:02:09.125]  where the woman's like beating the guy in the face and finally gets her back.
[03:02:09.125 --> 03:02:10.967]  This is all part of this brainwashing.
[03:02:10.967 --> 03:02:11.808]  It's like LARPing.
[03:02:11.808 --> 03:02:12.769]  Now, that's not D.C.
[03:02:12.769 --> 03:02:15.612]  It's a larger blonde-haired chick and she's hitting the guy.
[03:02:15.612 --> 03:02:15.792]  Right.
[03:02:15.792 --> 03:02:17.194]  Well, that was Goldie Locks.
[03:02:17.194 --> 03:02:18.315]  I forget what they call her.
[03:02:18.315 --> 03:02:21.218]  But she had tweeted out before she went there.
[03:02:21.218 --> 03:02:21.779]  What was she called?
[03:02:23.604 --> 03:02:25.266]  Oh, Moldy Locks, yeah, that was it.
[03:02:25.266 --> 03:02:28.810]  She had tweeted out before that, I'm gonna go get some Nazi scalps.
[03:02:28.810 --> 03:02:33.416]  Now, that guy, I think that's Nathan Domingo, he is an alt-right dude.
[03:02:33.416 --> 03:02:37.220]  I don't want my sister going to fight Nazis.
[03:02:38.086 --> 03:02:39.147]  Yeah, but pull up the one in D.C.
[03:02:39.147 --> 03:02:46.771]  where it's peaceful people, and the one guy's saying, hold back, hold back, let her hit you, and then she keeps hitting the guy over and over again, and he finally clocks her.
[03:02:46.771 --> 03:02:47.811]  We showed it earlier today, guys.
[03:02:47.811 --> 03:02:49.172]  Remember when we were young men?
[03:02:49.172 --> 03:02:50.633]  You never hit a chick.
[03:02:50.633 --> 03:02:52.454]  Like, women didn't fight.
[03:02:52.454 --> 03:02:53.975]  It wasn't part of their vernacular.
[03:02:53.975 --> 03:02:56.176]  Oh, but when I try to get into Trump's inauguration...
[03:02:57.128 --> 03:03:03.832]  When I tried to get into there, it was women up front with Antifa behind them trying to block you so it would look like you were attacking a woman.
[03:03:03.832 --> 03:03:05.532]  You'd be like, excuse me, and they'd hit you.
[03:03:05.532 --> 03:03:07.593]  And then they'd scream, you just hit a woman!
[03:03:07.593 --> 03:03:09.134]  I can't tell, you had a mask on!
[03:03:09.134 --> 03:03:10.715]  What are you doing at a brawl?
[03:03:10.715 --> 03:03:15.658]  You know in the 50s, the rumble seats, and they'd go have a big rumble with chains and stuff?
[03:03:15.658 --> 03:03:18.259]  Women were at the sock hop with the poodle skirts.
[03:03:18.259 --> 03:03:19.420]  They weren't going there.
[03:03:19.420 --> 03:03:21.101]  Hey guys, do me a favor.
[03:03:21.101 --> 03:03:22.081]  I'm not telepathic.
[03:03:22.081 --> 03:03:23.322]  I can't see the calls in there.
[03:03:24.002 --> 03:03:26.143]  So just put the calls up here on screen for me right here.
[03:03:26.143 --> 03:03:27.003]  That's awesome.
[03:03:27.003 --> 03:03:27.443]  Thanks a lot.
[03:03:27.443 --> 03:03:28.704]  I appreciate that.
[03:03:28.704 --> 03:03:30.245]  Okay, we're going to go to break.
[03:03:30.245 --> 03:03:31.505]  We're going to take two segments of calls.
[03:03:31.505 --> 03:03:33.826]  The Hagmans know every once in a while I preempt.
[03:03:33.826 --> 03:03:34.706]  Then you get a 30-minute break.
[03:03:34.706 --> 03:03:37.367]  We're going to meet, and you're going to go back on the war room, and then you're going to get out of here.
[03:03:37.367 --> 03:03:39.748]  But we've got Gavin McGinnis here with us.
[03:03:39.748 --> 03:03:41.749]  Tell folks briefly about the fundraiser.
[03:03:41.749 --> 03:03:42.489]  You're not involved in it.
[03:03:42.489 --> 03:03:51.133]  It goes right to the guys attacked by the Antifa professors, and the police supported them, and they're now trying to put them in prison, so they've got to be defended in New York.
[03:03:51.773 --> 03:03:53.794]  FundtheWest.org.
[03:03:53.794 --> 03:04:02.860]  Nine proud boys are facing serious prison time, serious charges, and a total of $350,000 of lawyers' fees.
[03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:10.085]  And this is because a simple case of self-defense was totally politicized by the media and the DNC.
[03:04:10.085 --> 03:04:12.007]  These kids were set up.
[03:04:12.007 --> 03:04:13.608]  These are blue-collar guys.
[03:04:13.608 --> 03:04:15.349]  They work in roofing and construction.
[03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:16.810]  They got jumped by Antifa.
[03:04:16.810 --> 03:04:21.033]  They fought back, and God forbid, they won.
[03:04:21.033 --> 03:04:21.533]  Sorry!
[03:04:22.133 --> 03:04:23.173]  Sorry someone defended you.
[03:04:23.173 --> 03:04:24.734]  And it's on video they got attacked.
[03:04:24.734 --> 03:04:26.394]  That's the craziest part of this whole thing!
[03:04:26.394 --> 03:04:28.975]  We've been playing just the fight that was 20 seconds.
[03:04:28.975 --> 03:04:33.776]  There's them coming to the event going F you and trying to and like frotting up and everything.
[03:04:33.776 --> 03:04:35.076]  And it's all there.
[03:04:35.076 --> 03:04:36.297]  They come looking for a fight.
[03:04:36.297 --> 03:04:37.797]  They attack.
[03:04:37.797 --> 03:04:40.918]  And the crime is you're supposed to just bow down and say yes meth-head.
[03:04:40.918 --> 03:04:42.218]  Yes meth-head.
[03:04:42.218 --> 03:04:43.778]  Beat me up meth-head.
[03:04:43.778 --> 03:04:44.859]  I mean my god boys.
[03:04:44.859 --> 03:04:46.699]  You're in the wrong department.
[03:04:46.699 --> 03:04:48.099]  You little meth-heads.
[03:04:48.099 --> 03:04:49.280]  I'm gonna get your asses handed to you.
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:50.280]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[03:04:54.164 --> 03:05:00.551]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:05:00.551 --> 03:05:02.113]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:05:02.113 --> 03:05:07.018]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[03:05:07.018 --> 03:05:09.942]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[03:05:10.482 --> 03:05:13.225]  A free gift with every order.
[03:05:13.225 --> 03:05:22.094]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:05:22.094 --> 03:05:25.757]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:05:25.757 --> 03:05:31.122]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:05:31.122 --> 03:05:33.525]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:05:34.045 --> 03:05:38.910]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:05:38.910 --> 03:05:40.452]  So this is a loss leader.
[03:05:40.452 --> 03:05:42.033]  We are losing money on this.
[03:05:42.033 --> 03:05:43.455]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:05:43.455 --> 03:05:45.457]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:05:45.457 --> 03:05:46.798]  And don't fight the crowds.
[03:05:46.798 --> 03:05:48.220]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:05:48.220 --> 03:05:49.741]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[03:06:13.445 --> 03:06:16.526]  All right, Gavin McGinnis is our guest in studio, recently banned.
[03:06:16.526 --> 03:06:18.686]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[03:06:18.686 --> 03:06:21.907]  You've got some big news you teased me with last night.
[03:06:21.907 --> 03:06:23.027]  You teased me again earlier.
[03:06:23.027 --> 03:06:30.709]  You don't want to say it all on air, but you're getting ready to file a major lawsuit against one of these Democratic Party labeling groups.
[03:06:30.709 --> 03:06:32.870]  And you've got folks that have previously worked with these groups.
[03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:37.371]  These are very high-profile, real liberals that are about to help you take these folks on.
[03:06:37.371 --> 03:06:42.432]  Because now these groups are anti-Israel, anti-America, anti-Christian, anti-free market.
[03:06:43.092 --> 03:06:46.836]  Then they have the nerve to call you a Nazi, so they've gone a little too far.
[03:06:46.836 --> 03:06:48.598]  Yes, and they talk about collusion.
[03:06:48.598 --> 03:06:50.800]  They are the ones colluding.
[03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:52.502]  They try to make it look separate, right?
[03:06:52.502 --> 03:06:53.643]  Oh, Twitter banned you.
[03:06:53.643 --> 03:06:55.245]  Oh, this guy called you a Nazi.
[03:06:55.245 --> 03:07:02.272]  But when we, and I think it's time to start suing the SPLC, Google, Twitter.
[03:07:02.933 --> 03:07:14.917]  And get discovery, because when we get discovery, we start seeing meetings, we start seeing emails, and they start saying things, like we've been talking about this whole show, where you have a thousand articles about you at the same time.
[03:07:14.917 --> 03:07:17.238]  That means that was planned.
[03:07:17.238 --> 03:07:17.698]  Sorry.
[03:07:17.698 --> 03:07:21.680]  They published the same minute, which means they all agree, so they don't all get publicity.
[03:07:21.680 --> 03:07:23.681]  It's like, I don't know, you don't break it first.
[03:07:23.681 --> 03:07:26.262]  Yes, so in a... You just kind of hinted at who you're suing.
[03:07:26.262 --> 03:07:27.262]  You just hinted at who you're suing.
[03:07:28.086 --> 03:07:37.489]  Yeah, well there's going to be a lot of John Doe's in there, but there has to be, there has to be SPLC, ADL, Google, they all need to get into the court system.
[03:07:37.489 --> 03:07:45.572]  We need to drag them into the court system so we can see evidence of them planning these coordinated attacks, because it's a concerted effort.
[03:07:47.493 --> 03:07:52.996]  They're so belligerent and such liars that they get up there and lie about things that are admitted fact.
[03:07:52.996 --> 03:07:56.377]  Like, we don't track you when you turn it off, even though they admit they do.
[03:07:56.377 --> 03:07:57.838]  You just can't use the function.
[03:07:57.838 --> 03:08:00.980]  So, we also need to have them prosecuted for lying.
[03:08:00.980 --> 03:08:01.160]  Yes.
[03:08:02.113 --> 03:08:04.155]  I mean, they've got more power than the NSA.
[03:08:04.155 --> 03:08:05.255]  And now they're allied with the left.
[03:08:05.255 --> 03:08:08.178]  You know, they're filling all the tech companies with the SJWs.
[03:08:08.178 --> 03:08:10.239]  They have a contract with the SPLC.
[03:08:10.239 --> 03:08:10.820]  And Soros.
[03:08:10.820 --> 03:08:13.962]  So they put their people in charge and they have your personal data.
[03:08:13.962 --> 03:08:14.823]  How creepy is that?
[03:08:14.823 --> 03:08:16.524]  I think what's happened is... Yeah, let me say it again.
[03:08:16.524 --> 03:08:19.006]  The Democratic Party has your data.
[03:08:19.006 --> 03:08:22.048]  The Democratic Party has their little political officers.
[03:08:22.048 --> 03:08:25.371]  The Google's moving into the former Stasi building in East Berlin.
[03:08:27.607 --> 03:08:35.150]  We're living in a country where everyone is using these encrypted apps now to communicate because they're so scared of being spied on.
[03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.891]  It's Stalinist.
[03:08:35.891 --> 03:08:39.952]  How many times have you seen someone with their computer with a little bit of tape over the camera?
[03:08:39.952 --> 03:08:42.553]  What is this, Czechoslovakia under Stalin?
[03:08:42.553 --> 03:08:43.934]  How did we get here?
[03:08:43.934 --> 03:08:53.658]  Well, you launched the whole hipster movement, and then it's a monster you hate, but I mean, I launched, it was in documentaries 18 years ago that I had a cover over webcams.
[03:08:54.394 --> 03:08:56.347]  And then now Comey says he does it, and Google does it.
[03:08:56.347 --> 03:08:57.414]  Zuckerberg does it!
[03:08:57.414 --> 03:08:57.555]  Yeah.
[03:08:59.431 --> 03:09:03.013]  Well of course, because that's what they're doing to you.
[03:09:03.013 --> 03:09:07.495]  What about taking these devices into your house, like the Alexa and the Google Assist?
[03:09:07.495 --> 03:09:08.696]  They admit they're watching.
[03:09:08.696 --> 03:09:19.541]  I'm at the point now where I talk to the FBI when I talk to people, because all the lawyers in the Proud Boys case say, call me on a burner phone, I don't want you talking about the case to me because your phone's tapped.
[03:09:19.541 --> 03:09:24.804]  So when I'm on my phone I go, hey FBI, surely you're seeing at this point that I'm a pretty good guy, right?
[03:09:24.804 --> 03:09:25.264]  You don't get it.
[03:09:25.524 --> 03:09:26.405]  Are you starting to like me?
[03:09:26.405 --> 03:09:26.846]  You're not listening.
[03:09:26.846 --> 03:09:29.009]  There's a lot of good jokes going back and forth here.
[03:09:29.009 --> 03:09:30.251]  Do you think I'm funny at least?
[03:09:30.251 --> 03:09:31.072]  You're not listening.
[03:09:31.072 --> 03:09:32.033]  You're not listening, Gavin.
[03:09:32.033 --> 03:09:33.856]  These are social climbers.
[03:09:33.856 --> 03:09:36.459]  They have like eight different CIAs.
[03:09:37.639 --> 03:09:39.920]  There's 18 different intelligence agencies.
[03:09:39.920 --> 03:09:42.300]  The FBI's probably five groups.
[03:09:42.300 --> 03:09:45.522]  Most of the FBI are dealing with kidnappings and bank robberies and missing kids.
[03:09:45.522 --> 03:09:46.182]  They're good people.
[03:09:46.182 --> 03:09:47.122]  Good men and women.
[03:09:47.122 --> 03:09:48.683]  Or Islamic stuff they're not even allowed to go after.
[03:09:48.683 --> 03:09:49.963]  They get in trouble when they do.
[03:09:49.963 --> 03:09:53.744]  They have special units like New York, dude.
[03:09:53.744 --> 03:09:55.885]  And other areas that go after you.
[03:09:55.885 --> 03:09:57.885]  They don't care you're a good person.
[03:09:57.885 --> 03:09:59.806]  They hate you because you are.
[03:09:59.806 --> 03:10:00.366]  You understand?
[03:10:00.366 --> 03:10:01.487]  Yeah, good point.
[03:10:01.487 --> 03:10:03.587]  So these are compartmentalized.
[03:10:03.587 --> 03:10:05.368]  They go, oh, you're saying the FBI's all criminal.
[03:10:05.368 --> 03:10:05.468]  No.
[03:10:06.789 --> 03:10:10.311]  It's like Trump said, the 35 angry Democrats that are running his persecution.
[03:10:10.311 --> 03:10:11.552]  It's a cabal, dude.
[03:10:11.552 --> 03:10:13.453]  It's a clique.
[03:10:13.453 --> 03:10:13.953]  It's a gang.
[03:10:13.953 --> 03:10:16.595]  We're going to do phone calls right now.
[03:10:16.595 --> 03:10:17.736]  You're great Americans for holding.
[03:10:17.736 --> 03:10:21.298]  Thomas Payne, the great state of Texas, you're on the air with Gavin McInnes.
[03:10:21.298 --> 03:10:22.879]  Go ahead.
[03:10:22.879 --> 03:10:24.220]  Gavin, proud of your boy.
[03:10:24.220 --> 03:10:24.780]  Proud of your boy.
[03:10:26.007 --> 03:10:31.309]  Gavin, I just want to say, I won't take up too much of your time, but Alex is preaching wisdom here, brother.
[03:10:31.309 --> 03:10:34.130]  We need to be listening to him.
[03:10:34.130 --> 03:10:36.371]  We don't need to be hiding in the shadows.
[03:10:36.371 --> 03:10:40.232]  Antifa and these liberals, everything they touch,
[03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:42.251]  Just turns to stone.
[03:10:42.251 --> 03:10:44.551]  They kill and destroy everything.
[03:10:44.551 --> 03:10:53.675]  Right now, Proud Boys and other brothers, we don't need to be hiding out in the shadows, waiting in the weeds, and it looks like we're capitulating to the left.
[03:10:53.675 --> 03:11:01.358]  Everything we're doing because we're not out, you know, promoting our charities, getting out to events because everybody's scared to be seen with what we're doing.
[03:11:01.898 --> 03:11:02.839]  Yeah, well Thomas brings up a good point.
[03:11:02.839 --> 03:11:07.343]  We don't want violence, so all Proud Boys have been avoiding doing any kind of rallies or charity work.
[03:11:22.216 --> 03:11:25.780]  They don't want to do charity work because they know there'll be a fight and it'll hurt the NYC9.
[03:11:25.780 --> 03:11:28.904]  But you can't let the enemy take us off the streets.
[03:11:28.904 --> 03:11:32.908]  We just say this is BS, they attacked us, it's bull, and attack.
[03:11:32.908 --> 03:11:38.014]  Believe me, the only reason I'm still here, and the few times I didn't attack, is all of our problems.
[03:11:38.014 --> 03:11:38.674]  We're in the right.
[03:11:39.295 --> 03:11:40.176]  Leave it up to God.
[03:11:40.176 --> 03:11:41.056]  Yes.
[03:11:41.056 --> 03:11:42.437]  Here's the million dollar question.
[03:11:42.437 --> 03:11:48.300]  So the commies always ruin everything and then people get mad and then they elect someone super far right to fix the problem.
[03:11:48.300 --> 03:11:49.701]  Like we're seeing in Italy now.
[03:11:49.701 --> 03:11:51.022]  We're seeing it all over Europe.
[03:11:51.022 --> 03:11:52.583]  We saw with Brexit.
[03:11:52.583 --> 03:11:56.805]  But sometimes the bad guys win and there's no fight back.
[03:11:56.805 --> 03:11:57.986]  Like look at Iran.
[03:11:57.986 --> 03:11:59.847]  It never recovered from the revolution in 1979.
[03:11:59.847 --> 03:12:00.227]  Look at Russia.
[03:12:02.068 --> 03:12:04.571]  It didn't bounce back from the commies.
[03:12:04.571 --> 03:12:05.913]  They stayed communist.
[03:12:05.913 --> 03:12:09.758]  So it's likely that we will eventually win and have truth and justice.
[03:12:09.758 --> 03:12:13.402]  But there's also a possibility that this place becomes Venezuela.
[03:12:13.402 --> 03:12:16.746]  We're gonna win because we're the real liberals.
[03:12:16.746 --> 03:12:16.887]  Yeah.
[03:12:18.086 --> 03:12:19.387]  And people think you're a liberal.
[03:12:19.387 --> 03:12:22.891]  Yeah, more guns, more freedom, more, more, more, more.
[03:12:22.891 --> 03:12:24.853]  By more I mean I run my damn life.
[03:12:24.853 --> 03:12:25.534]  I don't hurt you.
[03:12:25.534 --> 03:12:27.976]  I don't want to commit suicide.
[03:12:27.976 --> 03:12:28.617]  I'll never commit suicide.
[03:12:28.617 --> 03:12:30.539]  But if I want to, then I'm allowed to.
[03:12:30.539 --> 03:12:32.101]  I'm into freedom.
[03:12:32.101 --> 03:12:33.342]  So get used to it.
[03:12:33.342 --> 03:12:34.823]  But these control freaks can't deal with it.
[03:12:34.823 --> 03:12:36.045]  Thomas, anything else?
[03:12:37.971 --> 03:12:46.593]  I just want to say that I am the proudest of proud boys, and I'll tell you, we promote America.
[03:12:46.593 --> 03:12:47.913]  We promote charity.
[03:12:47.913 --> 03:12:54.695]  We put our disabled veterans, our homeless women and children above ourselves.
[03:12:54.695 --> 03:12:57.856]  That's who we put our charities, we number our charities.
[03:12:57.856 --> 03:12:58.536]  That's what we do.
[03:12:59.397 --> 03:13:01.159]  That's what Proud Boys are about.
[03:13:01.159 --> 03:13:05.083]  They're about putting ourselves behind the people who need it more.
[03:13:05.083 --> 03:13:09.288]  And that's what we need to get out in the face of people and show them what we're all about.
[03:13:09.288 --> 03:13:13.332]  I agree, but Thomas, you know the little secret that what you're doing only makes you stronger.
[03:13:14.013 --> 03:13:15.053]  So they hate that.
[03:13:15.053 --> 03:13:16.674]  This is what men are supposed to do.
[03:13:16.674 --> 03:13:18.875]  We were down in Texas for the hurricane.
[03:13:18.875 --> 03:13:19.795]  Was it Hurricane Harvey?
[03:13:19.795 --> 03:13:21.516]  That's right.
[03:13:21.516 --> 03:13:23.036]  And handing out water, rescuing people.
[03:13:23.036 --> 03:13:28.038]  Oh, they're so scared of a fraternity of men that's inclusive of all groups standing up.
[03:13:28.038 --> 03:13:31.079]  The meth heads are scared that men showed up.
[03:13:31.079 --> 03:13:33.600]  And so there was a group photo, and they had guns.
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:35.521]  You need guns when there's a hurricane going on.
[03:13:35.521 --> 03:13:36.622]  There's danger there.
[03:13:36.622 --> 03:13:38.202]  It's a dangerous environment.
[03:13:38.202 --> 03:13:39.403]  Yeah, there's crocodiles.
[03:13:39.403 --> 03:13:40.223]  Or alligators.
[03:13:41.294 --> 03:13:43.916]  The Proud Boys went down to Texas to hunt looters.
[03:13:43.916 --> 03:13:46.479]  And you know what really pisses me off about that?
[03:13:46.479 --> 03:13:54.326]  This is someone sitting on their ass, on their couch, texting about someone who got in a car and went into a hurricane to help people.
[03:13:54.326 --> 03:13:55.447]  So you're not doing anything.
[03:13:55.447 --> 03:13:57.969]  I'm not talking to you, Thomas, the people criticizing.
[03:13:57.969 --> 03:13:58.950]  You're not doing anything.
[03:13:58.950 --> 03:14:03.874]  You're sitting on your couch and you're criticizing people who are out there trying to save lives.
[03:14:03.874 --> 03:14:05.356]  And it goes back to this thing I've always said.
[03:14:05.956 --> 03:14:11.039]  The less you accomplish, the more you trivialize other people's accomplishments.
[03:14:11.039 --> 03:14:18.983]  These people are mentally obese, and they see other people out there trying to do good, and they go, eh, you're a bitch, you're a Nazi.
[03:14:18.983 --> 03:14:20.964]  Thomas, that's a great point, God bless you, great point there.
[03:14:20.964 --> 03:14:30.890]  I remember being 18, out of high school, and my parents moved to another house that wasn't as big as the house they had, and my mom had bought some oriental rugs.
[03:14:31.986 --> 03:14:35.592]  And she's sitting there to my dad, yeah, move this here, move that there.
[03:14:35.592 --> 03:14:38.497]  And I said, Mom, I think these look stupid.
[03:14:38.497 --> 03:14:41.241]  She goes, David, get him out of here by this weekend.
[03:14:41.241 --> 03:14:42.303]  And I was thrown out that week.
[03:14:43.590 --> 03:14:44.090]  I don't know.
[03:15:06.215 --> 03:15:07.596]  What the hell should look like?
[03:15:07.596 --> 03:15:10.579]  It was like, dude, she goes, David, he needs to move out, he's his own life.
[03:15:10.579 --> 03:15:20.408]  That could be in a nature documentary, like the mama grizzly bear sees the cub say those carpets look stupid, and then that's when the mama grizzly knew it was time for the cub to leave the tree.
[03:15:20.408 --> 03:15:25.072]  I did bring in the girlfriend that she didn't like, and who'd hit on my dad once in front of her.
[03:15:25.072 --> 03:15:25.552]  Whoa!
[03:15:25.552 --> 03:15:26.954]  Oh, this girl was amazing.
[03:15:26.954 --> 03:15:28.155]  But she didn't like her.
[03:15:28.155 --> 03:15:29.056]  That's balls.
[03:15:29.056 --> 03:15:29.996]  Yeah, it's like, yeah.
[03:15:31.513 --> 03:15:33.054]  So that was a bad time.
[03:15:33.054 --> 03:15:35.975]  So that was also a little icy on the cake.
[03:15:35.975 --> 03:15:37.576]  How do you get thrown out of the house when you're 18?
[03:15:37.576 --> 03:15:39.857]  Bring your girlfriend over that hits on your dad.
[03:15:39.857 --> 03:15:42.598]  That will get them thrown out quite quickly.
[03:15:42.598 --> 03:15:43.939]  More calls straight ahead.
[03:15:43.939 --> 03:15:46.280]  And then we've got Hagman and Hagman coming up.
[03:15:46.280 --> 03:15:47.661]  Always loaded for bear.
[03:15:47.661 --> 03:15:49.282]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:49.282 --> 03:15:50.122]  The enemy hates them.
[03:15:53.621 --> 03:15:54.842]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.842 --> 03:16:00.227]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.227 --> 03:16:03.129]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.129 --> 03:16:06.712]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[03:16:06.712 --> 03:16:14.278]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[03:16:53.406 --> 03:16:54.627]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.627 --> 03:16:58.548]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.548 --> 03:17:00.089]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:00.089 --> 03:17:03.050]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:03.050 --> 03:17:08.612]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:08.612 --> 03:17:09.813]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:09.813 --> 03:17:12.754]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:12.754 --> 03:17:14.975]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:17:23.038 --> 03:17:26.919]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:17:26.919 --> 03:17:31.901]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:17:31.901 --> 03:17:36.723]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[03:17:36.723 --> 03:17:38.083]  Don't just take my word for it.

[03:17:43.765 --> 03:17:46.066]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:17:54.178 --> 03:18:03.468]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:18:03.468 --> 03:18:06.351]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:18:06.351 --> 03:18:12.377]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:18:13.058 --> 03:18:19.304]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:18:19.304 --> 03:18:25.609]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:18:25.609 --> 03:18:32.535]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:18:33.676 --> 03:18:46.704]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:18:46.704 --> 03:18:50.967]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:18:50.967 --> 03:18:54.109]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:18:54.109 --> 03:19:02.454]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[03:19:03.118 --> 03:19:04.459]  We've been proven dead on.
[03:19:04.459 --> 03:19:08.342]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[03:19:08.342 --> 03:19:12.966]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[03:19:12.966 --> 03:19:14.847]  Words are not enough.
[03:19:14.847 --> 03:19:27.256]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open, free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[03:19:27.256 --> 03:19:30.579]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[03:19:31.226 --> 03:19:33.147]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[03:19:33.147 --> 03:19:37.590]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globally anti-human future.
[03:19:37.590 --> 03:19:43.414]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:19:43.414 --> 03:19:44.655]  I am in your hands.
[03:19:44.655 --> 03:19:57.223]  And we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[03:19:57.223 --> 03:19:59.865]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.051 --> 03:20:12.073]  I know you don't want to get into this.
[03:20:12.073 --> 03:20:13.755]  You don't want to take calls.
[03:20:13.755 --> 03:20:16.779]  I don't want to walk on the great folks.
[03:20:30.276 --> 03:20:32.698]  Very underrated song by the way, Eminence Front.
[03:20:32.698 --> 03:20:34.399]  Using a lot of car ads.
[03:20:34.399 --> 03:20:36.881]  That whole album is seen as a catastrophe.
[03:20:36.881 --> 03:20:38.762]  I think It's Hard is one of The Who's best albums.
[03:20:38.762 --> 03:20:39.303]  No, not great.
[03:20:39.303 --> 03:20:41.684]  But we got Hagman and Hagman coming up who are awesome guys.
[03:20:41.684 --> 03:20:42.305]  Always big news.
[03:20:42.305 --> 03:20:44.526]  But I want to take these calls, but briefly.
[03:20:44.526 --> 03:20:44.727]  You know...
[03:20:46.047 --> 03:20:54.917]  I saw the metrics in studies online, that of the three biggest shows on CRTV, it was Levin, you, and Steven Crowder, neck and neck.
[03:20:54.917 --> 03:21:01.684]  And then in comes Glenn Beck, because your three shows had more viewers than the other 50, 60 hosts combined.
[03:21:01.684 --> 03:21:05.308]  Magically, you had to go so the incredibly unpopular Glenn Beck could skate in.
[03:21:05.808 --> 03:21:12.353]  And then Glenn Beck's all over everywhere, you know, ninnying and virtue signaling and candy-assing around.
[03:21:12.353 --> 03:21:14.454]  That, oh, he likes Gavin.
[03:21:14.454 --> 03:21:16.116]  It wasn't him that did it.
[03:21:16.116 --> 03:21:19.958]  I hope you aren't buying that load of BS, buddy.
[03:21:19.958 --> 03:21:23.541]  That was a sweet gig I had over at BlazeTV and CRTV.
[03:21:23.541 --> 03:21:25.202]  It was really fun, too.
[03:21:25.202 --> 03:21:26.723]  You were at BlazeTV for one day.
[03:21:26.723 --> 03:21:29.205]  But Beck merged and you got fired.
[03:21:29.205 --> 03:21:30.286]  Beck has nothing to do with it.
[03:21:31.722 --> 03:21:36.325]  It's like lightning strikes you and your eyeballs burst out and blood comes out of your mouth and you die.
[03:21:36.325 --> 03:21:38.046]  The lightning strike had nothing to do with it.
[03:21:38.046 --> 03:21:40.407]  Glenn Beck taking it over and one day later you're fired.
[03:21:40.407 --> 03:21:43.169]  It had nothing to do with it.
[03:21:43.169 --> 03:21:44.389]  How about I punch you in the face?
[03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:46.130]  I already asked permission for this.
[03:21:46.130 --> 03:21:47.131]  I'm not going to hit him hard.
[03:21:47.131 --> 03:21:49.813]  No, I didn't say the face.
[03:21:49.813 --> 03:21:52.994]  This has nothing to do with you getting hit in the arm.
[03:21:52.994 --> 03:21:54.215]  That's a good punch, dude.
[03:21:54.215 --> 03:21:55.016]  That was a baby punch.
[03:21:55.016 --> 03:21:55.816]  Do you box?
[03:21:55.816 --> 03:21:56.516]  No.
[03:21:56.516 --> 03:21:57.617]  Get me back right here.
[03:21:57.617 --> 03:21:58.177]  I want the real deal.
[03:21:58.177 --> 03:21:58.878]  That was a baby punch.
[03:22:00.196 --> 03:22:01.497]  I'm gonna see if I can swivel the hip.
[03:22:01.497 --> 03:22:02.558]  Full power!
[03:22:02.558 --> 03:22:03.498]  I like that.
[03:22:03.498 --> 03:22:03.638]  Yeah.
[03:22:03.638 --> 03:22:04.419]  Let's do it again, right now.
[03:22:04.419 --> 03:22:05.240]  You know what I was doing?
[03:22:05.240 --> 03:22:07.461]  No, let's do it real in there.
[03:22:07.461 --> 03:22:10.043]  I'm gonna give you just a big one.
[03:22:10.043 --> 03:22:10.423]  Ow!
[03:22:10.423 --> 03:22:11.184]  Alright, now come on.
[03:22:11.184 --> 03:22:12.064]  Now that's good.
[03:22:12.064 --> 03:22:12.545]  Now come on.
[03:22:12.545 --> 03:22:14.426]  That felt like a pink shot!
[03:22:14.426 --> 03:22:14.846]  Give me back.
[03:22:14.846 --> 03:22:15.647]  You get five of them.
[03:22:15.647 --> 03:22:16.507]  You get five now.
[03:22:16.507 --> 03:22:17.128]  Oh, I get five?
[03:22:17.128 --> 03:22:19.089]  That hurt?
[03:22:24.257 --> 03:22:25.978]  Okay, he hit me hard later.
[03:22:25.978 --> 03:22:26.979]  Oh God!
[03:22:26.979 --> 03:22:28.320]  Okay.
[03:22:28.320 --> 03:22:29.340]  The first one was not that hard.
[03:22:29.340 --> 03:22:31.001]  I would have already five.
[03:22:31.001 --> 03:22:33.243]  Do I get one more now back for that?
[03:22:33.243 --> 03:22:33.863]  Oh my God.
[03:22:33.863 --> 03:22:35.144]  I'm gonna do this from heart.
[03:22:42.090 --> 03:22:43.310]  I felt like fire.
[03:22:43.310 --> 03:22:44.531]  No, you beat the hell out of me.
[03:22:44.531 --> 03:22:45.311]  Oh, that's burning.
[03:22:45.311 --> 03:22:46.691]  No, you barely hit me the first time.
[03:22:46.691 --> 03:22:48.412]  Jesus, those others were really bad.
[03:22:48.412 --> 03:22:52.333]  Well, I've got a little brother, so I think it's not just about the power.
[03:22:52.333 --> 03:22:55.294]  It's also about getting the knuckles right where the bone is.
[03:22:55.294 --> 03:22:59.355]  No, I was like, okay, that one hurt a little, but now I'm okay, and you just knocked the hell out of me.
[03:22:59.355 --> 03:23:00.975]  Fight you a little harder the next time.
[03:23:00.975 --> 03:23:01.956]  Oh, my God.
[03:23:01.956 --> 03:23:04.536]  I can still feel the exact shape of your knuckles right here.
[03:23:04.536 --> 03:23:05.497]  Well, then there's no knuckles left.
[03:23:05.497 --> 03:23:06.017]  Hey, feel that one.
[03:23:06.017 --> 03:23:06.497]  They're all gone.
[03:23:07.218 --> 03:23:09.043]  Have you ever seen that?
[03:23:09.043 --> 03:23:09.324]  Ew!
[03:23:09.324 --> 03:23:10.045]  What's going on there?
[03:23:10.045 --> 03:23:11.850]  There's no, there's no, there's no, look.
[03:23:11.850 --> 03:23:12.412]  Here, document cam.
[03:23:12.412 --> 03:23:13.755]  There's no attendance.
[03:23:13.755 --> 03:23:14.337]  Document cam, right here.
[03:23:15.657 --> 03:23:15.897]  Gross.
[03:23:15.897 --> 03:23:19.560]  There's no tennis, they're all gone.
[03:23:19.560 --> 03:23:21.982]  One time a guy's nose stuck right there.
[03:23:21.982 --> 03:23:22.983]  The whole bone.
[03:23:22.983 --> 03:23:26.786]  I punched him, but unlike a karate move where it goes in the brain, it came out into my hand.
[03:23:26.786 --> 03:23:28.608]  It was sticking out all purple.
[03:23:28.608 --> 03:23:29.709]  It was all purple.
[03:23:29.709 --> 03:23:30.289]  Whole nose bone.
[03:23:30.289 --> 03:23:31.290]  What do you mean, the cartilage?
[03:23:31.290 --> 03:23:31.911]  His nose bone?
[03:23:31.911 --> 03:23:34.133]  No, his nose bone stuck in my hand.
[03:23:34.133 --> 03:23:34.953]  That is disgusting.
[03:23:34.953 --> 03:23:37.776]  And then it got really infected and pus poured out of it for like three months.
[03:23:37.776 --> 03:23:40.118]  I thought they were gonna have to cut my pinky off.
[03:23:41.280 --> 03:23:46.824]  I got punched in the nose so hard once, that my entire nose was under my left eye.
[03:23:46.824 --> 03:23:47.084]  Wow.
[03:23:47.084 --> 03:23:49.506]  So when I went to touch the nose, it was gone.
[03:23:49.506 --> 03:23:57.752]  So then I started looking all over the ground trying to find my nose, because I assumed someone had whacked it off with a 2x4, and I need to go to the hospital to get it put back on.
[03:23:57.752 --> 03:23:59.714]  And then I was like, oh it's up here!
[03:23:59.714 --> 03:24:00.474]  There she is!
[03:24:00.474 --> 03:24:02.636]  That was a good bonding thing though.
[03:24:02.636 --> 03:24:03.376]  Yeah.
[03:24:03.376 --> 03:24:08.120]  Well see, cowboys are called violent because they have these beat-ins, where you have to name five breakfasts.
[03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:09.561]  Which are pretty nice, they're not hitting them that hard.
[03:24:09.941 --> 03:24:11.322]  We used to do that all the time.
[03:24:11.322 --> 03:24:19.509]  In high school, if you farted and you didn't say safety, we all got to be, or burped, we all got to beat you up until you could name five chocolate bars.
[03:24:19.509 --> 03:24:20.870]  And obviously you're not hitting them full power.
[03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:21.791]  I mean, I've seen the little retro.
[03:24:21.791 --> 03:24:22.831]  You're not trying to kill anyone.
[03:24:22.831 --> 03:24:25.153]  No, you just, well, there's a lot of good techniques.
[03:24:25.153 --> 03:24:27.775]  Tell you what, I'm joining Proud Boys, even though you're not the leader anymore.
[03:24:27.775 --> 03:24:29.637]  Go ahead and initiate me right now.
[03:24:29.637 --> 03:24:30.938]  Okay.
[03:24:30.938 --> 03:24:33.260]  All right, we're going to initiate some TV viewers right now.
[03:24:34.226 --> 03:24:35.247]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[03:24:35.247 --> 03:24:37.909]  So you have to say, I'm a proud Western chauvinist.
[03:24:37.909 --> 03:24:39.310]  Don't hit me as hard as you can with your arm.
[03:24:39.310 --> 03:24:40.211]  Okay.
[03:24:40.211 --> 03:24:41.191]  All right, all right, here we go.
[03:24:41.191 --> 03:24:41.832]  I'm actually scared.
[03:24:41.832 --> 03:24:42.372]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:24:42.372 --> 03:24:43.513]  I'm a proud Western chauvinist.
[03:24:43.513 --> 03:24:44.854]  I'm a proud Western chauvinist.
[03:24:44.854 --> 03:24:46.075]  And I refuse to apologize.
[03:24:46.075 --> 03:24:47.256]  And I refuse to apologize.
[03:24:47.256 --> 03:24:48.457]  For creating the modern world.
[03:24:48.457 --> 03:24:49.578]  For creating the modern world.
[03:24:49.578 --> 03:24:52.020]  Okay, you will now name five breakfast cereals.
[03:24:52.020 --> 03:24:53.581]  One, two, three.
[03:24:53.581 --> 03:24:55.743]  Captain Crunch!
[03:24:55.743 --> 03:24:57.384]  Fruit Gloop!
[03:24:57.384 --> 03:24:58.105]  Mini Wheats!
[03:24:58.105 --> 03:24:59.065]  Raisin Bread!
[03:25:00.211 --> 03:25:01.854]  Okay, okay, I'm done.
[03:25:01.854 --> 03:25:03.316]  Was that five?
[03:25:03.316 --> 03:25:05.719]  I was concentrating on my punches too much.
[03:25:06.835 --> 03:25:08.977]  I can't remember another one.
[03:25:08.977 --> 03:25:10.017]  Alright, I'm done.
[03:25:10.017 --> 03:25:11.278]  Kellogg's corn face.
[03:25:11.278 --> 03:25:16.001]  You know, I'm going to give Hagman and Hagman.com 10 new shows.
[03:25:16.001 --> 03:25:16.902]  They're so honored to do it.
[03:25:16.902 --> 03:25:18.423]  We've got to take these calls.
[03:25:18.423 --> 03:25:20.905]  But we'll let them come in and take over too.
[03:25:20.905 --> 03:25:23.366]  They're sitting in the wings there and they're just awesome guys.
[03:25:23.366 --> 03:25:26.128]  Hagman and Hagman, we're going to take a few calls and come to your next segment.
[03:25:26.128 --> 03:25:29.451]  But I've now been officially initiated into this terror group.
[03:25:29.451 --> 03:25:30.311]  Yep.
[03:25:30.311 --> 03:25:33.633]  You're now second degree proud boy.
[03:25:33.633 --> 03:25:33.794]  Okay.
[03:25:35.047 --> 03:25:38.189]  I like how you didn't hit me very hard the first time and hit me a lot harder later.
[03:25:38.189 --> 03:25:39.070]  That's a little sneaky.
[03:25:39.070 --> 03:25:40.091]  Yeah, a little hustler.
[03:25:40.091 --> 03:25:41.652]  You're a mark.
[03:25:41.652 --> 03:25:44.274]  Oh my god.
[03:25:44.274 --> 03:25:45.795]  Let's go to Johnny in Ontario, Canada.
[03:25:45.795 --> 03:25:46.676]  You're on the air with Gavin again.
[03:25:46.676 --> 03:25:49.197]  Let's go ahead.
[03:25:49.197 --> 03:25:49.858]  Hey Alex.
[03:25:49.858 --> 03:25:50.578]  Hey Gavin.
[03:25:50.578 --> 03:25:52.640]  No turkeys on the front line this time.
[03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:54.441]  Yes, sir.
[03:25:54.441 --> 03:25:55.922]  Turkeys in Parliament.
[03:25:55.922 --> 03:25:56.783]  Okay, Gavin.
[03:25:56.783 --> 03:25:58.484]  Come on, man.
[03:25:58.484 --> 03:26:03.688]  I was really scared when I seen you come on there because you looked like a broken man, but I think Alex has been good for you.
[03:26:04.648 --> 03:26:08.349]  Um, like I see a glint of the pirate coming back.
[03:26:08.349 --> 03:26:08.689]  I agree.
[03:26:08.689 --> 03:26:10.509]  Did beating on me make you feel better?
[03:26:10.509 --> 03:26:12.050]  Yeah, it did.
[03:26:12.050 --> 03:26:13.410]  It really did.
[03:26:13.410 --> 03:26:15.471]  Your accent's making me homesick, by the way, eh?
[03:26:15.471 --> 03:26:18.271]  Johnny's got a, Johnny Ontario's got a 2-4 under his arm there.
[03:26:18.271 --> 03:26:20.412]  It's like we're back in hockey season.
[03:26:20.412 --> 03:26:24.673]  Soon, I spent some time in Kanata and, uh, they fought and...
[03:26:26.169 --> 03:26:29.932]  Oh yeah, Zaphod Beeblebrox, my band Anal Chinook used to play there.
[03:26:29.932 --> 03:26:32.053]  They tried to charge me for a broken microphone.
[03:26:32.053 --> 03:26:34.354]  Sorry guy, that's the deal.
[03:26:34.354 --> 03:26:37.876]  Yeah, I appreciate your support.
[03:26:37.876 --> 03:26:46.602]  It is time to fight, but when your friends are facing years in prison for defending themselves, you get to the point where you think, I fought the law and the law won.
[03:26:47.242 --> 03:26:48.663]  Now, Honey Smash.
[03:26:48.663 --> 03:26:51.926]  That doesn't mean I don't want to go to court and get some discovery.
[03:26:51.926 --> 03:26:52.987]  Maybe that's my future.
[03:26:52.987 --> 03:26:54.669]  Maybe my future is lawfare.
[03:26:54.669 --> 03:26:57.051]  Raising money to sue these people.
[03:26:57.051 --> 03:26:57.772]  I don't know, man.
[03:26:57.772 --> 03:26:59.013]  Honey Smash.
[03:26:59.013 --> 03:26:59.833]  What is Honey Smash?
[03:26:59.833 --> 03:27:00.474]  That's the fifth one.
[03:27:00.474 --> 03:27:00.894]  I forgot.
[03:27:00.894 --> 03:27:03.276]  You were beating my ass.
[03:27:03.276 --> 03:27:04.498]  I couldn't remember the fifth one.
[03:27:04.498 --> 03:27:04.858]  Oh, OK.
[03:27:04.858 --> 03:27:07.240]  So he just became confirmed now.
[03:27:07.240 --> 03:27:08.962]  But thanks, Johnny.
[03:27:08.962 --> 03:27:10.243]  My code name is Honey Smash.
[03:27:12.602 --> 03:27:13.463]  Let's go to the caller here.
[03:27:13.463 --> 03:27:14.484]  Thank you, Johnny.
[03:27:14.484 --> 03:27:15.985]  That's his S&M.
[03:27:15.985 --> 03:27:17.667]  Alex in Montana.
[03:27:17.667 --> 03:27:18.007]  Go ahead.
[03:27:18.007 --> 03:27:18.468]  You're on the air.
[03:27:18.468 --> 03:27:21.350]  Hey, guys.
[03:27:21.350 --> 03:27:26.695]  Just want to show my support.
[03:27:26.695 --> 03:27:31.540]  You know, Gavin, I'm really sorry about what's happening to you, and I really feel for your man.
[03:27:31.540 --> 03:27:33.602]  I don't really know what to do.
[03:27:34.777 --> 03:27:38.780]  I mean, I'm out there with signs and I'm telling people about the census.
[03:27:38.780 --> 03:27:39.661]  Brother, that's it.
[03:27:39.661 --> 03:27:40.642]  Just spread the word.
[03:27:40.642 --> 03:27:41.562]  You're doing a great job.
[03:27:41.562 --> 03:27:42.683]  I'm spreading the word.
[03:27:42.683 --> 03:27:43.824]  I talk to people.
[03:27:43.824 --> 03:27:45.065]  I tell them about you guys.
[03:27:46.971 --> 03:27:47.411]  You know what I mean?
[03:27:47.411 --> 03:27:47.992]  I do what I can.
[03:28:05.768 --> 03:28:15.980]  Yeah, no, it's literal frothing George Soros-funded Nazi collaborators posing as a Jewish rights organization saying that pro-Israel people are Nazis?
[03:28:15.980 --> 03:28:17.282]  That's called fraud!
[03:28:17.282 --> 03:28:19.745]  Alan Dershowitz is a Nazi?
[03:28:19.745 --> 03:28:24.891]  I even heard at the last Ben Shapiro talk, they said Ben Shapiro's hate speech facilitates synagogue shooting.
[03:28:25.231 --> 03:28:27.413]  He has a yarmulke on his head!
[03:28:27.413 --> 03:28:29.794]  Listen, I don't play the racial religion card.
[03:28:29.794 --> 03:28:31.295]  My ex-wife is part Jewish.
[03:28:31.295 --> 03:28:33.336]  That legally makes my kids, that's their thing.
[03:28:33.336 --> 03:28:35.138]  I don't even think about it.
[03:28:35.138 --> 03:28:39.621]  The idea that I hate Jews, I'm not going to say I don't because it's not true.
[03:28:39.621 --> 03:28:41.102]  Hagman and Hagman straight ahead.
[03:28:41.102 --> 03:28:42.422]  They're loaded for bear.
[03:28:42.422 --> 03:28:43.303]  We'll jam a few more calls.
[03:28:43.303 --> 03:28:45.164]  I think we'll ride shotgun with these beauties.
[03:28:45.164 --> 03:28:46.845]  They got their own show they host every day as well.
[03:28:46.845 --> 03:28:49.387]  They don't have to hear me running around like a maniac.
[03:28:49.387 --> 03:28:52.029]  By the way, I'm going to knock you in the forehead in a minute.
[03:28:53.285 --> 03:28:56.887]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.887 --> 03:29:00.448]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.448 --> 03:29:02.589]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[03:29:02.589 --> 03:29:04.610]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?
[03:29:04.610 --> 03:29:10.373]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads, made by Biomed DB Design, right here in the USA, come in all sizes.

[03:29:22.378 --> 03:29:26.540]  Of course, Sunny Bay Heating Pads and Pillows are often an Amazon choice.

[03:29:55.033 --> 03:30:01.016]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[03:30:01.016 --> 03:30:01.916]  So I'll say it short and sweet.
[03:30:02.757 --> 03:30:05.139]  We need your support now more than ever.
[03:30:05.139 --> 03:30:07.980]  You've come through a thousand times so I'm not bitching at you.
[03:30:07.980 --> 03:30:10.962]  I'm just simply telling you we are in the thick of the battle now.
[03:30:10.962 --> 03:30:16.646]  The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential and down the road we probably will get destroyed.
[03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:29.874]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[03:30:29.874 --> 03:30:31.775]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[03:30:31.775 --> 03:30:37.497]  I need to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[03:30:37.497 --> 03:30:38.357]  But I need your prayers.
[03:30:38.357 --> 03:30:40.238]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[03:30:40.238 --> 03:30:42.219]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[03:30:42.219 --> 03:30:42.959]  We make it easy.
[03:30:43.559 --> 03:30:52.726]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:30:52.726 --> 03:30:53.126]  Believe me.
[03:31:03.573 --> 03:31:04.213]  I know.
[03:31:04.213 --> 03:31:08.896]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:08.896 --> 03:31:14.160]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:31:14.160 --> 03:31:28.369]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[03:31:28.749 --> 03:31:34.814]  To get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:31:34.814 --> 03:31:38.797]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:31:38.797 --> 03:31:42.480]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:31:42.480 --> 03:31:47.464]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:31:47.464 --> 03:31:50.206]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:31:50.206 --> 03:31:52.648]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:54.133 --> 03:32:00.541]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:32:00.541 --> 03:32:02.104]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:32:02.104 --> 03:32:07.010]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:09.934]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[03:32:10.454 --> 03:32:13.196]  A free gift with every order.
[03:32:13.196 --> 03:32:22.063]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:32:22.063 --> 03:32:25.725]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:32:25.725 --> 03:32:31.089]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:32:31.089 --> 03:32:33.491]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:32:34.031 --> 03:32:40.433]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had, so this is a lost leader.
[03:32:40.433 --> 03:32:41.993]  We are losing money on this.
[03:32:41.993 --> 03:32:43.434]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:32:43.434 --> 03:32:46.775]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.
[03:32:46.775 --> 03:32:51.776]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:32:51.776 --> 03:32:57.238]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[03:32:57.238 --> 03:32:59.879]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.138 --> 03:33:20.160]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:20.160 --> 03:33:21.980]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:21.980 --> 03:33:24.541]  I've got two apologies to make.
[03:33:24.541 --> 03:33:27.903]  Number one, it's all the callers that are holding, but we got a lot of phone lines, so I apologize.
[03:33:27.903 --> 03:33:28.723]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:33:28.723 --> 03:33:29.744]  I'll get your call.
[03:33:29.744 --> 03:33:30.944]  In fact, blow up the phones tomorrow.
[03:33:30.944 --> 03:33:32.925]  You tell people you were on there.
[03:33:32.925 --> 03:33:37.627]  Marcus and Riffin and James and George and Chris and Riss and Darren and Pete.
[03:33:37.627 --> 03:33:39.207]  I promise, front of the line.
[03:33:39.207 --> 03:33:40.268]  We gotta get Hagman.
[03:33:42.043 --> 03:33:43.144]  Doug Hagman, Joe Hagman.
[03:33:43.144 --> 03:33:43.984]  Great, smart guys.
[03:33:43.984 --> 03:33:45.745]  Father and son to break down what's happening.
[03:33:45.745 --> 03:33:48.106]  HagmanReport.com.
[03:33:48.106 --> 03:33:49.106]  We're taking over.
[03:33:49.106 --> 03:33:56.089]  Gavin, in about 30 minutes, you're going to be on the first 30 minutes of the War Room, and you're jumping on an aeroplane, one of those other scourges of Western civilization.
[03:33:56.089 --> 03:33:57.370]  Yeah.
[03:33:57.370 --> 03:33:58.370]  And flying back to New York.
[03:33:58.370 --> 03:33:59.891]  But, hey, chin up, buddy.
[03:33:59.891 --> 03:34:00.811]  I had a lot of fun with you.
[03:34:00.811 --> 03:34:01.412]  Just keep it up, brother.
[03:34:01.412 --> 03:34:02.372]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[03:34:02.372 --> 03:34:03.012]  Always a pleasure.
[03:34:03.012 --> 03:34:03.773]  Thanks for having me.
[03:34:03.773 --> 03:34:08.575]  I know they've been, you don't want to get into an aero, they've been harassing your wife and family and coming to your house, just like Tucker Carlson.
[03:34:08.955 --> 03:34:14.616]  And that's what they do, you know, and that's frustrating, but it's the prison sentences that are really freaking me out.
[03:34:14.616 --> 03:34:18.857]  I mean, this is... Bunch of meth heads attack you on video, then you go to jail.
[03:34:18.857 --> 03:34:21.918]  Yeah, people are going to jail for defending themselves.
[03:34:21.918 --> 03:34:22.618]  That's a new level.
[03:34:22.618 --> 03:34:23.718]  That's beyond harassment.
[03:34:23.718 --> 03:34:28.559]  This is now the justice system becoming social justice warriors.
[03:34:28.559 --> 03:34:30.280]  Well, it's great having you here in person.
[03:34:30.280 --> 03:34:31.060]  It's been amazing.
[03:34:31.060 --> 03:34:34.861]  Let's now go to even just as amazing folks, the Hagmans.
[03:34:34.861 --> 03:34:35.581]  Take it away, gentlemen.
[03:34:35.581 --> 03:34:36.401]  Thanks for letting us take over.
[03:34:37.402 --> 03:34:38.622]  Hey, Alex, thank you.
[03:34:38.622 --> 03:34:39.883]  Mr. McGinnis, thank you so much.
[03:34:39.883 --> 03:34:44.864]  By the way, does this mean that we're Proud Boys by proxy?
[03:34:44.864 --> 03:34:45.844]  Can we get in on this?
[03:34:45.844 --> 03:34:47.424]  Yeah, PBBP, they're called.
[03:34:47.424 --> 03:34:49.665]  Well, they pointed out, I didn't even do the fifth cereal.
[03:34:49.665 --> 03:34:51.925]  I was so... You can't think while you're being punched.
[03:34:51.925 --> 03:34:53.186]  It's obviously Lucky Charms.
[03:34:53.186 --> 03:34:54.286]  So now it's done.
[03:34:54.286 --> 03:34:54.846]  Now it's done.
[03:34:54.846 --> 03:34:56.186]  I was yelling that.
[03:34:56.186 --> 03:34:58.507]  You always say Lucky... Go ahead.
[03:34:58.507 --> 03:35:00.107]  Okay, now it's official.
[03:35:00.107 --> 03:35:01.487]  Lucky Charms.
[03:35:01.487 --> 03:35:02.548]  There you go.
[03:35:02.548 --> 03:35:03.588]  Full power, I'm about to get you.
[03:35:05.134 --> 03:35:06.234]  Upside, go full head.
[03:35:06.234 --> 03:35:07.495]  Sorry, gentlemen, take over.
[03:35:07.495 --> 03:35:08.195]  We're going to take over.
[03:35:08.195 --> 03:35:09.315]  Go ahead.
[03:35:09.315 --> 03:35:10.236]  No, it was great.
[03:35:10.236 --> 03:35:10.836]  It was great.
[03:35:10.836 --> 03:35:12.816]  And wow.
[03:35:12.816 --> 03:35:14.517]  Powerful segment, indeed.
[03:35:14.517 --> 03:35:16.758]  And thank you, Alex.
[03:35:16.758 --> 03:35:18.298]  It's an honor to be here, by the way.
[03:35:18.298 --> 03:35:20.699]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:20.699 --> 03:35:25.260]  Don't forget, support InfoWars, support their fight against tyranny.
[03:35:25.260 --> 03:35:26.461]  We need to do this.
[03:35:26.461 --> 03:35:28.541]  That's right out of the gate when I say that.
[03:35:28.541 --> 03:35:29.802]  A lot of things to get into.
[03:35:29.802 --> 03:35:30.402]  But by the way,
[03:35:31.883 --> 03:35:33.784]  Proud Boys by Proxy.
[03:35:33.784 --> 03:35:35.125]  I just have to say that again.
[03:35:35.125 --> 03:35:44.132]  I'd be a bloody stump, I'm telling you.
[03:35:44.132 --> 03:35:50.917]  I get this, which is why we don't go in the studio with InfoWars because, you know, you just... but no, I'm kidding.
[03:35:50.917 --> 03:35:52.778]  Again, powerful segments.
[03:35:53.658 --> 03:35:56.982]  But what we've got here today, right now, I just want to jump in real quick here.
[03:35:56.982 --> 03:35:59.604]  We've got a lot of stuff, a lot of things going on.
[03:35:59.604 --> 03:36:05.430]  Of course, we've got Clinton whistleblowers set to make explosive allegations here this week.
[03:36:05.430 --> 03:36:09.515]  Three Clinton Foundation whistleblowers are going to speak out today.
[03:36:09.515 --> 03:36:12.638]  Explosive allegations, this according to Mark Meadows.
[03:36:15.584 --> 03:36:20.652]  And 6,000 pages of evidence from the Clinton Foundation investigation being looked over.
[03:36:20.652 --> 03:36:22.595]  Is this the end of the Clinton Foundation?
[03:36:22.595 --> 03:36:25.860]  Yeah, I think the end is smelling up and rotting.
[03:36:25.860 --> 03:36:26.802]  That's just one issue.
[03:36:29.205 --> 03:36:29.886]  We're good to go.
[03:36:50.602 --> 03:36:50.782]  That's
[03:37:06.919 --> 03:37:08.340]  Was there something held back?
[03:37:08.340 --> 03:37:14.462]  Were they looking for other information that this whistleblower had held on to that was not turned over?
[03:37:14.462 --> 03:37:21.304]  Because why would they raid the house of a whistleblower who turned over the information if the information was already accessible by those law enforcement agencies?
[03:37:21.304 --> 03:37:23.745]  So, some interesting stuff definitely going on with that.
[03:37:24.572 --> 03:37:26.294]  Oh, exactly.
[03:37:26.294 --> 03:37:28.577]  But consider this, too.
[03:37:28.577 --> 03:37:30.338]  The pay-to-play accusations.
[03:37:30.338 --> 03:37:33.081]  Peter Schweitzer has written about this in Clinton Cash.
[03:37:33.081 --> 03:37:39.188]  But consider the pay-to-play allegations that are being levied right now that people are saying, oh, that's just conspiracy theory.
[03:37:39.188 --> 03:37:42.031]  Of course, MSNBC, Conspiracy Central.
[03:37:42.031 --> 03:37:43.633]  But you've got to look at the numbers.
[03:37:45.074 --> 03:37:48.417]  New York Post has shown the contributions to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:37:48.417 --> 03:37:54.602]  Consider Clinton, Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State during a three-year period from 2009.
[03:37:54.602 --> 03:37:57.805]  The Clinton Foundation, just in one year, being 2016-2017, the donations went from
[03:38:05.152 --> 03:38:08.895]  $62,912,331 in 2016 when of course she was still perhaps going to be president to $26,566,825 in 2017.
[03:38:08.895 --> 03:38:13.300]  But even worse when you look at the numbers and these are undeniable.
[03:38:26.873 --> 03:38:34.701]  The foundation itself, and I just want to hit this real quick, hid $2.3 million in foreign donations.
[03:38:34.701 --> 03:38:42.729]  $2.3 million in foreign donations from the head of the Russian government uranium company that had business before Hillary's State Department.
[03:38:42.729 --> 03:38:49.976]  That was approved by CFIUS, of course, and CFIUS is basically the entire nine-person panel of CFIUS.
[03:38:50.576 --> 03:38:54.319]  Compromised by the entire Uranium One and other scandals.
[03:38:54.319 --> 03:38:57.241]  So look, folks, this is not conspiracy theory.
[03:38:57.241 --> 03:38:59.463]  This is absolute truth.
[03:38:59.463 --> 03:39:07.149]  Which is why, perhaps, Hillary Bill cancelled their 13-city high school gymnasium tour.
[03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:19.335]  Anyway, half a million dollars that William Jefferson Clinton begged for a speech in Moscow paid for by a Kremlin-linked bank.
[03:39:19.335 --> 03:39:22.716]  While Clinton was serving as Secretary of State.
[03:39:22.716 --> 03:39:24.297]  She was in that office.
[03:39:25.753 --> 03:39:33.576]  $26 million of their wealth comes from speaking fees by companies and organizations that are also major Clinton Foundation donors.
[03:39:33.576 --> 03:39:40.338]  Look, this stuff is ugly to the core and we're expecting justice needs to be done here.
[03:39:41.347 --> 03:39:54.537]  On another note, I don't know, Dad, if you saw this, but there's been a release of an IG report pertaining to the text messages, a report of investigation recovery of text messages from certain FBI mobile devices.
[03:39:54.537 --> 03:40:04.305]  I have not had a chance to go through this, but this is documenting the thousands of text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and many which were said to have been erased.
[03:40:06.427 --> 03:40:17.117]  They go on to say that the FBI is unable to find or recover missing text messages from Strzok and Page, but they're going to continue to dig.
[03:40:17.117 --> 03:40:25.765]  But that's a report I just received or just saw here as we were waiting to come on air, so that'll be interesting to see what comes out of that as well.
[03:40:25.765 --> 03:40:29.208]  It seems like their whole house of cards of the conspiracy against President Trump
[03:40:29.748 --> 03:40:37.513]  The weaponization by the deep state of all the intelligence agencies against President Trump to fail in the end and now be exposed.
[03:40:37.513 --> 03:40:41.135]  We're seeing their house of cards collapse and it's really interesting to watch yet.
[03:40:41.135 --> 03:40:44.837]  I am still, I don't believe we're going to see the perp walks.
[03:40:44.837 --> 03:40:48.059]  I'm very upset that we have not seen charges brought.
[03:40:48.059 --> 03:40:51.902]  I know it takes a long time to build cases, but we need to see action on this.
[03:40:51.902 --> 03:40:53.523]  We need to get a real Attorney General in there.
[03:40:54.243 --> 03:40:56.964]  Jeff Sessions obviously was a mistake from the beginning.
[03:40:56.964 --> 03:41:02.905]  He seemed to be more of a protector of the deep state and their crimes than one to go after them and expose them.
[03:41:02.905 --> 03:41:09.147]  But hopefully we see a turnaround with a new Attorney General once they are in there sworn in.
[03:41:09.147 --> 03:41:12.468]  But when are we going to see these criminals held accountable for their crimes?
[03:41:13.028 --> 03:41:19.534]  You know, you mentioned the Attorney General, and I hope people understand William Barr has been implicated.
[03:41:19.534 --> 03:41:26.900]  Now look, the verification of this information is a little bit sketchy.
[03:41:26.900 --> 03:41:33.466]  However, it's solid enough where I would say it's been authenticated.
[03:41:33.466 --> 03:41:37.149]  William Barr, as the person to head the AG's office,
[03:41:38.110 --> 03:41:53.620]  It had a major role if you listen to former CIA operative agent Terry Reid in his book Compromise, had a major role in the guns for drugs Iran-Contra dealings back in the 80s.
[03:41:53.620 --> 03:41:58.423]  His name was Robert Johnson according to Terry Reid in his book titled Compromise.
[03:41:58.423 --> 03:42:01.365]  So there are things that are a little bit disturbing on that front.
[03:42:02.445 --> 03:42:05.087]  Why him and why that position and why now?
[03:42:05.087 --> 03:42:11.310]  But one more thing I want to get into here as we only have about 40 seconds here before the break.
[03:42:11.310 --> 03:42:15.793]  The major news on Flynn, Michael Flynn with respect to the 302s, FD302s.
[03:42:15.793 --> 03:42:18.334]  We're going to get to that here momentarily.
[03:42:18.334 --> 03:42:20.416]  You're listening to InfoWars.
[03:42:20.416 --> 03:42:22.357]  Doug and Joe Agnew sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:42:22.357 --> 03:42:22.757]  InfoWars.
[03:42:22.757 --> 03:42:24.418]  Don't forget to visit InfoWars store.
[03:42:24.938 --> 03:42:26.979]  Infowarestore.com.
[03:42:26.979 --> 03:42:28.300]  Hey, do your Christmas shopping.
[03:42:28.300 --> 03:42:29.521]  Support free speech.
[03:42:29.521 --> 03:42:31.082]  Support this platform.
[03:42:31.082 --> 03:42:32.242]  Just do it.
[03:42:32.242 --> 03:42:33.143]  We need everybody.
[03:42:33.143 --> 03:42:34.924]  Be right back.
[03:42:53.280 --> 03:42:57.244]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.244 --> 03:43:00.547]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:43:00.547 --> 03:43:06.813]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:06.813 --> 03:43:09.595]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:43:10.316 --> 03:43:14.139]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.139 --> 03:43:20.605]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.605 --> 03:43:25.569]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:26.334 --> 03:43:30.255]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:43:30.255 --> 03:43:37.437]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.437 --> 03:43:42.659]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.659 --> 03:43:48.361]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.361 --> 03:43:52.322]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.194 --> 03:43:57.297]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:57.297 --> 03:44:04.382]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:44:04.382 --> 03:44:09.206]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.

[03:44:54.156 --> 03:45:03.205]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[03:45:03.205 --> 03:45:04.546]  We've been proven dead on.
[03:45:04.546 --> 03:45:08.409]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[03:45:08.409 --> 03:45:12.814]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you.
[03:45:12.814 --> 03:45:14.115]  All words are not enough.
[03:45:14.921 --> 03:45:21.103]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[03:45:21.103 --> 03:45:27.425]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[03:45:27.425 --> 03:45:31.287]  They've created their Tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[03:45:31.287 --> 03:45:33.208]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[03:45:33.208 --> 03:45:37.189]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[03:45:37.802 --> 03:45:43.488]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:45:43.488 --> 03:45:54.158]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[03:45:54.158 --> 03:45:58.022]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:45:59.375 --> 03:46:08.057]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:46:08.057 --> 03:46:10.058]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:46:10.058 --> 03:46:13.499]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:46:13.499 --> 03:46:16.119]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:46:16.119 --> 03:46:17.680]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:46:18.400 --> 03:46:30.832]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:35.702]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:46:35.702 --> 03:46:36.883]  We'll win.
[03:46:36.883 --> 03:46:39.784]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[03:46:39.784 --> 03:46:46.948]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:46:46.948 --> 03:46:50.630]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:52.191]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[03:46:52.191 --> 03:46:52.871]  We need your support.
[03:46:52.871 --> 03:46:56.733]  I'm counting on you.
[03:46:56.733 --> 03:46:59.295]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.757 --> 03:47:15.701]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:15.701 --> 03:47:21.934]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Doug Hagman.
[03:47:28.135 --> 03:47:29.997]  Sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:47:29.997 --> 03:47:31.859]  It's me, Doug Hagman.
[03:47:31.859 --> 03:47:33.060]  HagmanReport.com.
[03:47:33.060 --> 03:47:34.841]  HagmanReportLive.com.
[03:47:34.841 --> 03:47:36.523]  Also, my son, Joe Hagman.
[03:47:36.523 --> 03:47:38.825]  Together, we are, as I said, the Hagman Report.
[03:47:38.825 --> 03:47:44.170]  Of course, very proud to be sitting in for InfoWars' fourth hour, Alex Jones.
[03:47:44.170 --> 03:47:51.997]  The last segment, we were talking about a number of things from the Clinton Foundation, really unraveling and showing... Flynn.
[03:47:51.997 --> 03:47:52.978]  Yeah, and Flynn.
[03:47:52.978 --> 03:47:53.358]  That's right.
[03:47:54.418 --> 03:48:00.662]  Right, and thanks Joe, because you and I have been looking at this and of course there's been a lot of major revelations here.
[03:48:00.662 --> 03:48:05.806]  Here's, in a nutshell, let me just give you the outline because I think that this is extremely important.
[03:48:05.806 --> 03:48:10.949]  General Flynn served as National Security Advisor roughly for 24 days during the transition.
[03:48:10.949 --> 03:48:16.253]  Really, if you want to call it serving, that's perhaps generous.
[03:48:17.043 --> 03:48:20.227]  But for about, just a little over three weeks.
[03:48:20.227 --> 03:48:35.124]  And he was interviewed by the FBI, two FBI agents, Peter Strzok and Joe Pientka, I believe is how you pronounce his name, on January 24th of 2017, just a couple weeks after President Trump was sworn in.
[03:48:35.883 --> 03:48:36.723]  Right.
[03:48:36.723 --> 03:48:50.347]  Now, what's important about this, so that we make sure we make this distinction, is that Flynn was told not to have his lawyer with him, and as soon as the FBI agents began to question him, he realized he was being ambushed over his phone calls to Russian Ambassador Kislyak.
[03:48:50.347 --> 03:48:58.869]  So, he was asked not to bring an attorney, which anybody who's ever going to talk to the FBI, you have an attorney present, but he was told not to bring one.
[03:48:59.649 --> 03:49:15.512]  Well, yeah, and what they were doing, what the FBI was doing, and it was clear in the initial FD-302, the 302-4, that described them as jovial and animated and jocular and, you know, friendly.
[03:49:15.512 --> 03:49:22.993]  What they were doing was, this was a complete setup by the Clinton-Obama cabal.
[03:49:22.993 --> 03:49:24.393]  General Flynn, obviously, was set up.
[03:49:24.393 --> 03:49:25.654]  There's no question about that.
[03:49:25.654 --> 03:49:27.414]  But here's what's coming to light now.
[03:49:28.650 --> 03:49:30.692]  Folks, you remember Ted Stevens.
[03:49:30.692 --> 03:49:32.093]  Does that name ring a bell?
[03:49:32.093 --> 03:49:33.314]  How about Enron?
[03:49:33.314 --> 03:49:35.776]  How about Arthur Anderson?
[03:49:35.776 --> 03:49:40.701]  Well, how about former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell, who wrote License to Lie?
[03:49:40.701 --> 03:49:47.848]  In fact, she laid out the Andrew Weissman pitbull, Creeps on a Mission.
[03:49:47.848 --> 03:49:50.591]  If you haven't read that book, I suggest you do because, of course,
[03:49:51.389 --> 03:50:10.238]  Mueller, his FBI, really the entirety of the Intelligence Committee is broken down, and the abuses are broken down in that book that took place against Enron, that took place against Arthur Anderson in particular, that ruined the company, ruined many people's lives, and when it turned out it was all for naught and for nothing.
[03:50:10.238 --> 03:50:14.059]  But what they did to Michael Flynn is on January 24th, 2017, there was a meeting.
[03:50:16.253 --> 03:50:16.754]  I think?
[03:50:34.944 --> 03:50:44.332]  A guy, by the way, who also appears in previous Hillary Clinton Foundation issues, as well as matters relating to Uranium One, but that's another story.
[03:50:44.332 --> 03:50:45.453]  Go ahead.
[03:50:45.453 --> 03:50:52.959]  I want to make sure that we talk about this as Judge Sullivan, and what this means.
[03:50:52.959 --> 03:50:57.763]  Was this not the same judge that, during the Manafort case, he, the judge,
[03:50:58.463 --> 03:51:08.691]  It pretty much gave the prosecutors a verbal lashing about their intent to ruin Manafort's life in an effort to undermine and get President Trump, to get him to flip on President Trump.
[03:51:10.039 --> 03:51:22.089]  Yeah, you know what, I'm not 100% certain with respect to which, yeah, I know the Manafort trial, I'm not sure which role he played, if any, in that.
[03:51:22.089 --> 03:51:37.241]  But I do know, going back a little further, Emmitt Sullivan was the guy who really berated Weissman and, of course, the Intelligence Committee for violating all of the, well, for actually doing the same
[03:51:37.341 --> 03:51:37.721]  That's right.
[03:51:52.675 --> 03:51:58.998]  Two FBI agents, including Strzok, of course, interview Michael Flynn.
[03:51:58.998 --> 03:52:06.602]  And it was on February 14th, there was a 302 apparently that was created on her.
[03:52:06.602 --> 03:52:17.388]  Well, I'm sorry, on February 14th, there was a reference made to a 302 that was created either contemporaneous to or shortly after the Flynn interview on January 24th.
[03:52:18.928 --> 03:52:25.173]  However, and this is where it gets really dicey, and don't forget Comey was fired on May 9th of 2017.
[03:52:25.173 --> 03:52:35.460]  Okay, so this is where it gets really a little bit complicated, but not so much that you can't really, you know, people can't understand it.
[03:52:35.460 --> 03:52:41.484]  In the run-up to sentencing, now remember, the sentencing for Michael Flynn was delayed numerous times, right?
[03:52:41.484 --> 03:52:42.325]  Three times at least.
[03:52:43.204 --> 03:52:44.144]  At least.
[03:52:44.144 --> 03:52:58.628]  Now we've got an indication on the sentencing memo that Judge Emmett Sullivan looked at from Mueller from this crossfire hurricane that's going to turn into nothing less than, you know, light rain, if anything.
[03:52:58.628 --> 03:53:04.970]  There's a 302 that's dated August 22nd of 2017, some seven months minus a couple of days.
[03:53:04.970 --> 03:53:07.531]  We'll just call it even seven months after the interview.
[03:53:08.530 --> 03:53:17.892]  So, what this means is, the initial interview or the interview with Michael Flynn was on January 24, 2017.
[03:53:17.892 --> 03:53:24.074]  No deception detected according to Comey's testimony.
[03:53:24.074 --> 03:53:24.674]  Right.
[03:53:24.674 --> 03:53:34.536]  But how in the world could he know that if he was fired in May and the 302 was dated in August of 2017, August 22nd?
[03:53:34.536 --> 03:53:37.417]  There's no way he could know it unless a couple of things happen.
[03:53:38.181 --> 03:53:45.333]  Unless he was privy to something during that time or privy to something after his firing, which is not likely.
[03:53:45.333 --> 03:53:51.103]  But the more likely scenario is that the forms, the 302s, were changed.
[03:53:52.043 --> 03:53:56.804]  And who changed them, when did they change them, and why did they change them?
[03:53:56.804 --> 03:53:59.885]  That's what Judge Evan Sullivan said.
[03:53:59.885 --> 03:54:10.568]  And by the way, he said, to read this blistering statement, he said, I want the 302s tomorrow, meaning Friday, tomorrow, by 3 o'clock, and I want them all.
[03:54:10.568 --> 03:54:11.688]  I want everything.
[03:54:11.688 --> 03:54:12.408]  That's right.
[03:54:12.408 --> 03:54:15.169]  So, it's pretty interesting how this is working out.
[03:54:16.289 --> 03:54:19.110]  And will those, you know, ever be made public?
[03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:21.271]  I don't know that they will.
[03:54:21.271 --> 03:54:27.413]  But just the fact that what Robert Mueller did, you know, we talk about them, you know, switching the bait and switch.
[03:54:27.413 --> 03:54:38.937]  They're ending the Russian collusion probe, which was the whole original mandate of the special prosecutor's mission, which usually needs an underlying crime to launch that special prosecutor's position.
[03:54:38.937 --> 03:54:40.298]  But there was no underlying crime.
[03:54:40.738 --> 03:54:55.918]  And I said this on our show, and I'll say it here, if and when Robert Mueller decides to end the collusion aspect of the investigation, I believe President Trump should fire him immediately because now he is going outside of the scope of the authority, which there really was an authority to begin with.
[03:54:56.298 --> 03:54:57.019]  We're good to go.
[03:55:12.650 --> 03:55:18.375]  Well, you know, and I totally agree, and I know you've been working on this as well, researching this as well, but I'll tell you something.
[03:55:18.375 --> 03:55:30.123]  The new meme, the new narrative, since the crossfire hurricane, the Russian collusion, whatever that means, conspiracy with Russians, oh my gosh, you know, since that's gone, guess what?
[03:55:30.123 --> 03:55:36.048]  They're moving, they're looking at potential funding by what?
[03:55:36.048 --> 03:55:38.350]  By Middle Eastern countries now.
[03:55:38.350 --> 03:55:38.930]  Okay?
[03:55:38.930 --> 03:55:39.931]  And they're so desperate.
[03:55:40.771 --> 03:55:42.078]  They're so desperate.
[03:55:42.078 --> 03:55:43.424]  It's bother- Yeah.
[03:55:43.424 --> 03:55:43.665]  Go ahead.
[03:55:44.358 --> 03:56:11.869]  Reporting Trump at one point wanting to build a Trump Tower in Moscow Which was never done as some sort of crime or as proof of collusion Him being a business tycoon in the real estate Wanting to build Trump Towers in major cities all over the world But they are looking at things like this like oh he planned to build the Trump Tower in Moscow and trying to use that As evidence, but I did see what the what you said the looking into the middle
[03:56:11.869 --> 03:56:12.129]  I don't know.
[03:56:25.846 --> 03:56:29.368]  Exactly, and remember one name, Catherine Rumler.
[03:56:29.368 --> 03:56:30.848]  That's Catherine Rumler.
[03:56:30.848 --> 03:56:37.091]  She was the, as Dan Bongino calls her, the fixer for Obama, Obama's counsel.
[03:56:37.091 --> 03:56:43.014]  That name, you're going to be hearing Catherine Rumler come up more and more as this goes way out of control.
[03:56:43.014 --> 03:56:47.096]  The wheels come off of the Mueller investigation, and you're right, this needs to be shut down.
[03:56:47.096 --> 03:56:49.157]  We've got about, we've got less than a minute, Joe.
[03:56:50.337 --> 03:56:55.080]  Look, we are under fire with respect to the censorship and banning issues.
[03:56:55.080 --> 03:56:57.801]  Alex Jones, Gavin McGinnis, of course, under fire.
[03:56:57.801 --> 03:56:58.521]  We need to fight.
[03:56:58.521 --> 03:56:59.742]  We need to stick together, folks.
[03:56:59.742 --> 03:57:01.363]  Our message is this.
[03:57:01.363 --> 03:57:02.763]  We are teaming up.
[03:57:02.763 --> 03:57:05.124]  We need to stay together.
[03:57:05.124 --> 03:57:06.725]  We need to get this message out there.
[03:57:06.725 --> 03:57:08.726]  This is the information they don't want you to hear.
[03:57:08.726 --> 03:57:10.427]  They want you to listen to Rachel Madcow.
[03:57:10.427 --> 03:57:14.689]  They want you to listen to, you know, Mika Brzezinski.
[03:57:14.689 --> 03:57:17.450]  Oh gosh, they want you to listen to.
[03:57:17.450 --> 03:57:18.751]  So we got about 20 seconds, Joe.
[03:57:19.514 --> 03:57:20.715]  Keep your eyes on South Africa.
[03:57:20.715 --> 03:57:28.063]  The politicians are now urging followers to kill whites, saying we will kill their children, their women, and their animals.
[03:57:28.063 --> 03:57:32.587]  This is re-emerging as a big story, so keep your eyes on that as well.
[03:57:32.587 --> 03:57:33.928]  It's a global war.
[03:57:33.928 --> 03:57:34.869]  Alright, thank you.
[03:57:34.869 --> 03:57:36.111]  It's a global war.

[03:57:38.553 --> 03:57:39.013]  God bless.

[03:58:23.834 --> 03:58:24.735]  Everybody knows it.
[03:58:24.735 --> 03:58:25.996]  History documents it.
[03:58:25.996 --> 03:58:29.538]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history.
[03:58:51.747 --> 03:58:53.247]  That wants to hurt children.
[03:58:53.247 --> 03:58:54.368]  They want to abort children.
[03:58:54.368 --> 03:58:56.128]  They want to disease children.
[03:58:56.128 --> 03:58:57.248]  They want to abuse children.
[03:58:57.248 --> 03:58:58.869]  They want to confuse children.
[03:58:58.869 --> 03:59:00.049]  They want their essence.
[03:59:00.049 --> 03:59:01.009]  They want their soul.
[03:59:01.009 --> 03:59:02.329]  They want their spirit.
[03:59:02.329 --> 03:59:04.090]  They want their power.
[03:59:04.090 --> 03:59:06.330]  Because they are our future.
[03:59:06.330 --> 03:59:09.831]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[03:59:09.831 --> 03:59:11.812]  It is about the West.
[03:59:11.812 --> 03:59:15.953]  It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[03:59:15.953 --> 03:59:17.513]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[03:59:18.726 --> 03:59:29.251]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[03:59:29.251 --> 03:59:31.332]  You have the power to override the censors.
[03:59:31.332 --> 03:59:34.393]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[03:59:34.393 --> 03:59:43.477]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[03:59:47.723 --> 03:59:50.335]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
