[00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:32.054]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:32.214 --> 00:00:35.377]  Russia is demanding a meeting.
[00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:38.482]  Between President Putin and President Trump.
[00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:42.023]  President Trump has already met with Theresa May four or five times.
[00:00:42.043 --> 00:00:44.184]  He's already met with the French President a couple times.
[00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.065]  He's already met with the Chinese President multiple times.
[00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:49.766]  In China and in the U.S.
[00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:53.888]  He's already met with hundreds of world leaders, but not with Russia.
[00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.251]  Even at the height of the Cold War, there were meetings with the Russian dictators.
[00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:05.351]  Well, Putin's not a dictator in my view, but even if he was, they should be meeting with him.
[00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:07.573]  That's a big story we're going to be looking at.
[00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.516]  A meeting with Putin, if it happens soon, would involve a different Trump.
[00:01:14.098 --> 00:01:17.721]  Another headline, Russia presses Trump for White House meeting with Putin.
[00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:23.306]  It's already been, what, 15 months, 16 months since Trump has been in office.
[00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:25.448]  This is unprecedented.
[00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:52.142]  We're going to be looking at Trump outraged over Mexico migrant caravan and mainstream media is trying to act like, corporate media is trying to act like it's weird that if you have the UN and Soros and the regular groups that organize the caravans across the ocean and through the Middle East, through Turkey and Eastern Europe, it turned out to be a trickle, then a flood, then a torrent, 10 million plus military age men just the last four or five years.
[00:01:54.024 --> 00:01:54.444]  This is
[00:01:56.385 --> 00:02:02.670]  A corridor being broken through Central and South America into the United States.
[00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.232]  And they're saying our demands are no borders.
[00:02:06.053 --> 00:02:09.535]  Our demands are we're allowed to take over your entire society.
[00:02:11.157 --> 00:02:16.201]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to our breakdown of this with the groups.
[00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:18.397]  Demands.
[00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:20.980]  It is very, very, very important.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.466]  We'll go over the outrageous demands of the group when we come back.
[00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:28.370]  And then, I was going to air this last Thursday, but I said, you know what?
[00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:29.432]  I'm going to wait.
[00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:34.138]  That way we can really promote it.
[00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.720]  We're going to air some of the Ted Nugent interview that's now on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.120]  Even if you're awake and know about the Second Amendment, you name it.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.700]  This is information warfare.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.360]  Using the truth.
[00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:46.081]  Promote that Ted Nugent interview.
[00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:47.261]  It is powerful.
[00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:48.241]  It's pure Americana.
[00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.682]  It's called Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview.
[00:02:51.182 --> 00:02:53.062]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:02:53.102 --> 00:02:54.802]  We tweeted it out at RealAlexJones.
[00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:55.623]  I've asked Paul to tweet it.
[00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:57.423]  I'm asking all of you to tweet it out as well.
[00:02:57.703 --> 00:02:58.323]  So that's coming up.
[00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:02.644]  And then we're going to
[00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:22.524]  Continue on looking at the other news reported Florida shooter discussed Allah Akbar on Instagram And how that was all the early news coming out that even mainstream media linked to and looked at a routine practice and how We published a retraction
[00:03:25.692 --> 00:03:35.696]  And we also didn't just publish a retraction, we had an editor's note and followed all the Texas statutory rules and removed the photo of the individual that was not Cruz.
[00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:36.896]  We never even said the person's name.
[00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:50.961]  Well, InfoWars has been sued for that and they claim that statutorily that we never did the retraction, but the retraction and the correction is there as well.
[00:03:52.034 --> 00:03:56.378]  So we're going to be looking at that whole situation and how shoddy this is.
[00:03:56.578 --> 00:04:03.965]  Even lawyers in BuzzFeed and the Daily Beast said, this is a really flimsy lawsuit and they could get sued for this.
[00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:05.287]  Why'd they do that?
[00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:13.514]  Well, it's because it's about creating the branding that InfoWars equals lawsuit or InfoWars is fake news.
[00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:16.037]  That's what it is.
[00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:22.375]  And then they have as exhibits in here other people's websites, and not even stuff we link to.
[00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:27.617]  They've got one thing in there that we did post, but then they show an exhibit from someone else's website.
[00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:34.239]  So, it's just full of holes like all of these, because there's really not anything real to attack us on.
[00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:40.441]  So, we're gonna be breaking all of that down as well today.
[00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:44.102]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:04:46.243 --> 00:04:49.969]  We'll be right back on the other side of this global transmission.
[00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.573]  And believe me, we are the tip of the spear.
[00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:53.594]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:04:53.634 --> 00:04:55.056]  That's why we need your support, your prayers.
[00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.860]  I know you're doing it more than ever, so I salute you and thank you.
[00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:58.562]  Stay with us.

[00:06:04.713 --> 00:06:09.057]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:16.867]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:06:17.327 --> 00:06:25.714]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:06:25.854 --> 00:06:37.203]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[00:06:37.323 --> 00:06:38.845]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:55.520]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.842]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:06:58.303 --> 00:07:04.689]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:09.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:10.037 --> 00:07:15.221]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:32.394]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are at war with America, they're at war with nation states, they're at war with Christianity.
[00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:36.597]  They're at war against everything that's free and open.
[00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:44.730]  And their main captain is a horrible, evil, 89-year-old, 88-year-old Nazi collaborator named George Soros.
[00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:47.531]  And the left is not the left.
[00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:56.295]  They are a criminal combine that seeks the overthrow of culture and the enslavement of producers.
[00:07:57.315 --> 00:08:05.419]  And the ultra-rich are tax-exempt, outside the nation-state, international, and above the law.
[00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.155]  And they are trying to destroy President Trump.
[00:08:09.996 --> 00:08:11.417]  They're trying to destroy Infowars.
[00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:12.778]  They're trying to destroy the free press.
[00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:32.598]  And I, quite frankly, am honored to be right at the center of their attacks because they know what we're talking about is absolutely on target dealing with the globalist operation, their program, and how to stop them.
[00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:37.269]  We're going to get into Russia, presses Trump for White House meeting with Putin.
[00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:38.190]  That's really important.
[00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.591]  The big interview, Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview is finally up.
[00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:43.932]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:59.559]  But the first big thing I want to cover when we get to the next segment is Trump threatens to cut off aid to Honduras over big caravan.
[00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:03.161]  Trump declares DACA dead, urges Congress to act on border.
[00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:07.991]  South Texas Border Patrol agents overwhelmed by illegal border crossers.
[00:09:09.872 --> 00:09:14.734]  Caravan releases list of demands and expects Trump to comply.
[00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:23.519]  Open the borders to us because we are as much citizens as the people of countries where we are and or travel.
[00:09:24.557 --> 00:09:25.718]  That's globalism right there.
[00:09:25.738 --> 00:09:26.738]  That's direct UN.
[00:09:26.758 --> 00:09:30.020]  Who do you think runs the UN refugee operation out of Honduras?
[00:09:30.401 --> 00:09:31.421]  That's where it was actually based.
[00:09:32.102 --> 00:09:34.583]  They would decide from Central and South America who could come into the U.S.
[00:09:34.623 --> 00:09:38.085]  and tell the State Department under Obama via UNESCO who could come in.
[00:09:39.966 --> 00:09:44.929]  And there are migrants coming in out of Africa, the Middle East, you name it, into Honduras as the staging point.
[00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:45.650]  You can look that up.
[00:09:46.997 --> 00:09:58.565]  Until Trump killed it about a year ago now, six months into office, five months into office, if you remember, the UN ran the refugee program and then the State Department took orders from it.
[00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:06.730]  And this is just like Soros opened up those arteries through Turkey, out of the Middle East, through Syria.
[00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:15.456]  The Syrian invasion was as much a migrant invasion through Syria and a takeover by the Islamists and the globalists as it
[00:10:17.068 --> 00:10:19.050]  was for the invasion of Europe.
[00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:27.356]  And of course, the Zodiac boats by the hundreds a day coming into Italy, dumping off the folks out of North Africa.
[00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:33.901]  And then the EU now wants a Navy to stop the Italian Navy turning back the invaders.
[00:10:34.182 --> 00:10:38.485]  And the EU said a few months ago, we will start attacking your ships.
[00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:41.407]  So here it is.
[00:10:41.448 --> 00:10:45.451]  Caravan through Mexico is one of the largest in 10-year Trek history.
[00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:51.470]  Third Mexican town welcomes migrant caravan 400 miles closer to U.S.
[00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:59.353]  They pledged to continue on even though the Mexican government says it will disband the caravan, but organizers say some of its members will continue north.
[00:10:59.373 --> 00:11:04.935]  So this is about busting our government open, our sovereignty open.
[00:11:04.975 --> 00:11:15.718]  It's all the UN plan to invade the first world with the third world, not to empower the third world that the globalists have been completely using and abusing and dominating and controlling.
[00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:19.817]  By financing left-wing and right-wing governments.
[00:11:20.898 --> 00:11:25.042]  The UN, the IMF comes in and will do the leftist funding generally.
[00:11:25.062 --> 00:11:28.585]  Then the US and others come in and do the right-wing funding, but it's all controlled.
[00:11:29.066 --> 00:11:30.127]  It all consolidates power.
[00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:34.791]  Remember, Perkins went public with the confessions of an economic hitman?
[00:11:35.532 --> 00:11:37.914]  Now it was left and right control, but it was all the same thing.
[00:11:39.036 --> 00:11:42.319]  So, that's where we are dealing with this.
[00:11:44.275 --> 00:11:48.118]  We're going to be playing some of those clips and getting into Trump and getting into their unbelievable demands.
[00:11:48.158 --> 00:12:04.509]  But what's interesting is that the media is acting like Trump's a weirdo or some type of delusional rube because the president is obsessed with this and pointing this out.
[00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:06.271]  This is a direct UN
[00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:20.223]  Globalist invasion operation that they've already done in Europe and once they bust it open, once they open a hole up, they will collapse the entire country.
[00:12:20.924 --> 00:12:24.147]  Then they'll use the giant new groups they brought in political leverage.
[00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:26.929]  So more on that and their demands in the next segment.
[00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:31.554]  Then I'm going to get into the latest false lawsuit.
[00:12:33.993 --> 00:12:35.434]  against Infowars filed yesterday.
[00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.356]  Hey, I got a two-week rest this time.
[00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:38.456]  It wasn't a couple in a week.
[00:12:40.318 --> 00:12:42.019]  And again, I'm being honest with the listeners.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:49.044]  All of these lawsuits are, according to multiple law firms I've checked with, the complete trash grade.
[00:12:50.345 --> 00:12:52.747]  You got penny stocks, you got junk stocks, you got blue chips.
[00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:54.068]  This is junk stocks.
[00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.652]  I mean, the filings, 90% of them aren't even accurate.
[00:12:58.712 --> 00:13:00.593]  It's other people's websites, other quotes.
[00:13:00.673 --> 00:13:02.214]  It's just a demonization of Infowars.
[00:13:02.255 --> 00:13:02.555]  And even
[00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:10.738]  Even the Daily Beast and others have quotes and they're saying there's major slapback provisions here.
[00:13:10.758 --> 00:13:11.859]  You can scroll into the article.
[00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:14.861]  You know, there's no lawsuit here.
[00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:15.922]  This is really dangerous.
[00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:18.043]  The people that filed it, why did they do it?
[00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:24.008]  And it turns out we did do the correction retraction before the 30-day deadline.
[00:13:24.308 --> 00:13:32.554]  And we did remove it the day of, not three weeks later when we got their letter about an image of Nick Cruz.
[00:13:33.752 --> 00:13:36.073]  That was all over the media that wasn't Nick Cruz.
[00:13:36.093 --> 00:13:37.293]  It was a guy in a communist shirt.
[00:13:37.313 --> 00:13:38.254]  We're not going to show the guy.
[00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:39.874]  We didn't even say his name.
[00:13:40.335 --> 00:13:41.035]  Other people did.
[00:13:42.135 --> 00:13:43.176]  We said, allegedly.
[00:13:45.217 --> 00:13:50.359]  The guy's name wasn't even known out there until he went to the media, made an issue out of it, attached his name to it.
[00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:52.880]  And so we've been singled out.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.381]  And, you know, I'm sad that happened to them and all the rest of them.
[00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:58.602]  You have a right to wear a hammer and sickle shirt if you want to in America.
[00:13:58.622 --> 00:14:03.264]  And, you know, that individual is not Cruz.
[00:14:04.775 --> 00:14:05.175]  The shooter.
[00:14:06.175 --> 00:14:12.637]  But it just shows how, under state law, we have the retraction in, and we had the removal before we even got the letter.
[00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:13.818]  We had the removal.
[00:14:14.218 --> 00:14:15.598]  And then everybody else still has it up.
[00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:20.280]  But it's us that get sued, and the lawyers look at that and they say, yeah, there's not a lawsuit here.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.581]  But there is a PR stunt for the law firms.
[00:14:25.261 --> 00:14:33.644]  And maybe these plaintiffs don't know, but they better have signed documents from these law firms that when there's the slapback suit,
[00:14:35.946 --> 00:14:38.269]  Even the Daily Beast has the classic slapback.
[00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:41.192]  All these groups.
[00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.977]  That they've got a serious problem.
[00:14:46.337 --> 00:14:48.079]  So we're going to talk about that coming up as well.
[00:14:48.099 --> 00:14:49.861]  But this is because the globalists fear us.
[00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:52.063]  Now that said, we've got to end this special today.
[00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:58.010]  It is your financing of this broadcast that makes all of this possible.
[00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:04.482]  And it doesn't take a ton of money to beat each one of these, but it takes money to then do the slap suit and get the money back.
[00:15:04.502 --> 00:15:06.767]  So it's going to take a lot of money because there's a lot of lawsuits.
[00:15:06.827 --> 00:15:07.648]  We need a lot of money.
[00:15:08.009 --> 00:15:10.233]  And I need everybody to get products you already need.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.785]  High quality air filtration, water filtration, books, videos, t-shirts, thousands of great items, and the supplements.
[00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:20.728]  They're all there at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:23.610]  And we've got to end a lot of these specials.
[00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:32.498]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze, BrainForce Plus 50% off, the Real Red Pill 50% off, and free shipping when you get it with the Real Red Pill and BrainForce on top of 50%, MycoZX.
[00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:35.139]  Which has more in each bottle.
[00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:36.260]  Michael's DX Plus.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:36.980]  50% off.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.180]  That's all got to end today.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.261]  Because a bunch of them are about to sell out.
[00:15:41.621 --> 00:15:42.321]  Body Ease.
[00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.621]  Just came back in.
[00:15:43.741 --> 00:15:44.841]  Ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:15:45.442 --> 00:15:45.902]  Amazing.
[00:15:45.982 --> 00:15:47.142]  Highest quality.
[00:15:47.182 --> 00:15:48.242]  Strongest out there.
[00:15:48.702 --> 00:15:49.222]  We believe it.
[00:15:49.242 --> 00:15:50.983]  I know it's in the top 1% of quality.
[00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:55.264]  And it is 25% off and sold out back in store.
[00:15:55.324 --> 00:15:56.564]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:15:56.924 --> 00:15:58.464]  Without you, we will fall.
[00:15:58.544 --> 00:15:59.805]  With you, we will prevail.
[00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:00.605]  Stay with us.
[00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:09.686]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[00:16:10.566 --> 00:16:22.993]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[00:16:23.653 --> 00:16:34.139]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[00:16:34.719 --> 00:16:41.500]  InfoWarsLife's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:56.204]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[00:16:56.744 --> 00:16:59.424]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:17:02.987 --> 00:17:06.429]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[00:17:06.749 --> 00:17:13.492]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[00:17:13.792 --> 00:17:18.534]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[00:17:18.554 --> 00:17:19.055]  It's very simple.
[00:17:19.295 --> 00:17:21.436]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[00:17:21.796 --> 00:17:23.637]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[00:17:23.737 --> 00:17:25.518]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:26.598]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[00:17:26.718 --> 00:17:27.459]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:17:32.401 --> 00:17:35.283]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:17:35.603 --> 00:17:39.586]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:17:39.886 --> 00:17:43.689]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:47.151]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:50.513]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:17:50.773 --> 00:17:54.156]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[00:17:54.396 --> 00:17:56.697]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:17:56.997 --> 00:17:57.698]  It's amazing.
[00:17:58.018 --> 00:18:00.620]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:18:02.901 --> 00:18:06.784]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:18:07.325 --> 00:18:14.730]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.134]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:18:20.754 --> 00:18:22.655]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:26.718]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:29.981]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:37.304]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:18:37.904 --> 00:18:45.147]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:18:46.007 --> 00:18:52.649]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.310]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.491]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:18:57.311 --> 00:19:00.273]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:19:00.813 --> 00:19:02.614]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:11.880]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:20.045]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:25.029]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:31.916]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:32.016 --> 00:19:39.102]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:19:39.182 --> 00:19:40.924]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:19:41.084 --> 00:19:46.046]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:19:46.206 --> 00:19:50.568]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:19:50.688 --> 00:19:53.950]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:19:54.070 --> 00:20:00.213]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:20:00.373 --> 00:20:02.594]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:09.097]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:26.815 --> 00:20:31.556]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:33.317 --> 00:20:39.238]  Well, we took a major beachhead in the swamp, and Trump is doing his best job to deliver.
[00:20:39.258 --> 00:20:41.439]  I don't think any of us could do as good a job as he's done.
[00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:50.561]  It's easy to be uncultured and constantly criticize him, and I think there's a role there to hold feet to the fire, but Trump doesn't need his feet held to the fire.
[00:20:50.601 --> 00:20:53.682]  He's getting as much done as he can not being a dictator.
[00:20:55.418 --> 00:21:01.119]  Now that said, what the president is a dictator over, and the executive, is the borders with foreigners.
[00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:13.082]  They don't have the rights of citizens, and people don't in any other nation in the world, except the EU, where they're collapsing into North Africa and into the Middle East, with all the nightmares that come with that.
[00:21:14.102 --> 00:21:20.044]  But this caravan has been going on for 10 years, bringing people in from different parts of the world into the United States.
[00:21:21.329 --> 00:21:31.438]  And that's the point I've been making is that Honduras is the staging ground of the UN Refugee Resettlement Program in Central America.
[00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:43.229]  It's the main base to bring in African and Islamic, European, you name it, illegals that can pay money to get into the U.S.
[00:21:45.302 --> 00:22:03.246]  Not a lot of Chinese coming in, but remember, it was about four years ago, three years ago, the head of South Con, head of South Con, came out and warned everyone and said, Al-Qaeda and ISIS are coming into the U.S.
[00:22:03.266 --> 00:22:04.206]  through Honduras.
[00:22:04.286 --> 00:22:05.247]  You can search engine that.
[00:22:06.207 --> 00:22:11.228]  General in charge of South Con, Ida Al-Qaeda coming in through Central America.
[00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:17.997]  And then you read, where they're coming into, it's Honduras.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.864]  So, that's why you look at these migrants, and most of them aren't even Hispanic.
[00:22:26.565 --> 00:22:31.429]  A lot of them are Arabic, black, you name it, because they have come here from other parts of the world.
[00:22:31.469 --> 00:22:35.412]  There it is, Islamic State can infiltrate U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, General says.
[00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:39.716]  Scroll down a little bit, I want to read that Washington Post article, please.
[00:22:39.896 --> 00:22:40.196]  Thank you.
[00:22:46.371 --> 00:22:56.556]  About 100 people have joined the Islamic State Militant Group from countries in the Caribbean and South America, and existing human smuggling networks are in place that could allow them to infiltrate the United States if they return.
[00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:01.718]  Said Marine General John F. Kelly, Chief of the Southern Command.
[00:23:01.738 --> 00:23:04.179]  I wonder where Trump's getting all his intel to stop this now.
[00:23:04.739 --> 00:23:13.744]  Told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the networks are so efficient that if a terrorist or almost anyone wants to get into the country, they just pay the fare.
[00:23:14.787 --> 00:23:21.410]  The reason I just had them search engine that, that was what, three or four years ago, when he was not in the executive branch.
[00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:26.172]  But the military, the head of Southcom, I don't just say these things.
[00:23:26.932 --> 00:23:33.755]  I don't just say the UN has its base down there, or it was being run by Peter Southerland, who just died a few months ago, the head of the UN refugee program.
[00:23:34.655 --> 00:23:37.136]  What I'm telling you that is, yeah, there's a map right there.
[00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:41.398]  The Washington Post, showing
[00:23:44.195 --> 00:23:54.003]  How people are streaming into Syria to invade, and then streaming back out into Europe, Africa, and Central and South America into the U.S.
[00:23:55.484 --> 00:23:58.687]  Terrorists from groups beside ISIS crossing U.S.-Mexico border.
[00:23:58.767 --> 00:23:58.907]  U.S.
[00:23:58.927 --> 00:24:05.493]  Representative Ron DeSantis says, and even PolitiFact has to admit that's true.
[00:24:05.973 --> 00:24:08.335]  Of course, they lie most of the time, so you know it's ultra-true.
[00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:10.457]  So, that's what's going on here.
[00:24:11.857 --> 00:24:22.720]  And then you read the out-of-control, redonkulous demands, and you look at how the President's being criticized for, quote, being obsessed with this.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:33.342]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can pull up the London Guardian articles, where Mexico pours pepper sauce down your nose, if you're lucky.
[00:24:33.402 --> 00:24:34.643]  If you're not, they really hurt you.
[00:24:35.483 --> 00:24:39.184]  And they torture you, if you are an illegal.
[00:24:40.106 --> 00:24:44.068]  And if you help an illegal, they are known to kill you.
[00:24:44.088 --> 00:24:47.189]  And that's come out in documentaries.
[00:24:47.229 --> 00:24:54.393]  They take people basically in slaughterhouses, and they hang you up by chains, and they beat you in the legs, and then they slit your throat.
[00:24:56.974 --> 00:24:59.595]  Now, I don't want to slit the throats of coyotes.
[00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:02.480]  Smugglers.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.443]  I don't want to shoot Tabasco up their noses either.
[00:25:06.124 --> 00:25:16.797]  But the Mexican government also knows that the coyotes have killed over 100,000 people conservatively on just the border with Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California.
[00:25:16.817 --> 00:25:19.580]  I mean, they have found already over 100,000 people in the last decade.
[00:25:20.962 --> 00:25:22.723]  And they think there's probably five times that.
[00:25:22.783 --> 00:25:25.404]  I mean, they are robbing these people.
[00:25:25.444 --> 00:25:26.804]  They are abusing these people.
[00:25:26.904 --> 00:25:27.804]  It is horrible.
[00:25:28.205 --> 00:25:29.825]  I want to see these countries industrialized.
[00:25:29.885 --> 00:25:30.985]  I want to see them first world.
[00:25:31.246 --> 00:25:34.027]  I want to see Mexico beautiful everywhere like it is in some spots.
[00:25:34.407 --> 00:25:35.267]  And first world.
[00:25:35.347 --> 00:25:36.287]  I'll go move down there.
[00:25:36.627 --> 00:25:37.788]  I'm not afraid of brown people.
[00:25:38.848 --> 00:25:42.209]  I'm afraid of brown people turning to leftists that hate my guts just like white leftists.
[00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.331]  But that's the reality of where we are.
[00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:49.532]  And then you get these insane demands.
[00:25:51.241 --> 00:25:52.181]  It's crazy!
[00:25:57.023 --> 00:26:03.245]  But if you look at this caravan, the media will focus on maybe one woman out of a hundred, but I've watched the videos closely.
[00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:09.027]  Just like the North African invasion, it's like we'll see one woman, and the media focuses on that, who's sent over as a tokenism.
[00:26:09.387 --> 00:26:11.108]  This isn't women and children, this is men!
[00:26:12.264 --> 00:26:14.246]  They've been organized by Soros and the U.N.
[00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:20.310]  and they are setting a migration wave chain to implode the U.S.
[00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.792]  and sink this lifeboat, not just the others.
[00:26:24.733 --> 00:26:26.395]  So I don't blame these men wanting to come here.
[00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:27.616]  There's a woman right there.
[00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:29.697]  I don't blame these people wanting a better future.
[00:26:29.797 --> 00:26:30.278]  I get it.
[00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:34.541]  But the point is, is that they're being used as a weapon.
[00:26:36.155 --> 00:26:38.637]  Listen to this, and you listen to this globalist rhetoric.
[00:26:39.017 --> 00:26:45.201]  Open the borders to us because we are as much citizens as people of countries where we are and travel.
[00:26:47.483 --> 00:26:52.406]  I'm gonna read the rest of the insane demands that are right out of globalism and give you their mission.
[00:26:52.426 --> 00:26:56.589]  It's on InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and LinkedIn on DrugsReport.com.
[00:26:56.609 --> 00:26:58.050]  You've got the most complete coverage.
[00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.671]  Now I'm gonna plug again because I tend to plug like once an hour.
[00:27:02.473 --> 00:27:05.615]  And I need to, Google kicked us off
[00:27:06.874 --> 00:27:10.376]  The ad roll last year, that cost us about $5 million.
[00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:17.519]  And I thought, oh, well, we'll ramp up some other online advertising by next year, but it just didn't ever get back to that number.
[00:27:17.579 --> 00:27:18.539]  Got up to about $2 million.
[00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:22.401]  We're bringing in, that sounds like a lot, not when you got 100 crew members and built this infrastructure.
[00:27:22.421 --> 00:27:30.204]  So I was looking at this year while we're not bringing in as much, and it's because of that Google advertising ban last year.
[00:27:30.264 --> 00:27:31.125]  Talk about draconian.
[00:27:32.569 --> 00:27:33.669]  So we're back at that point.
[00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:37.670]  I need everybody to understand you really need to take turmeric for your family, you and your children.
[00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:41.891]  You really need the colloidal silver we've got in your medicine cabinet.
[00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:43.151]  You really need brain force.
[00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:44.892]  You really need the real red pill.
[00:27:44.912 --> 00:27:46.432]  They make people's lives so much better.
[00:27:46.472 --> 00:27:48.613]  These are the most cutting-edge supplements.
[00:27:49.313 --> 00:27:51.993]  The leading competitors put five, seven times the markup on it.
[00:27:52.394 --> 00:27:53.014]  We don't do that.
[00:27:54.954 --> 00:27:55.874]  We don't have a 700% markup.
[00:27:55.914 --> 00:27:56.535]  We have a 100% markup.
[00:27:59.457 --> 00:28:02.498]  That means again, if it costs $10, we sell it for $20.
[00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:06.700]  After the marketing and all the expenses, I mean, nobody sells quality products.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.882]  We use four different major suppliers, top labs, none of them can believe we put this much product in.
[00:28:12.262 --> 00:28:15.923]  These are all the very best products and they're great and they're amazing.
[00:28:16.264 --> 00:28:18.564]  We've got the biggest sales, we've run a long time, 50% off the
[00:28:20.834 --> 00:28:23.258]  Real Red Pill, the seven-day challenge.
[00:28:23.278 --> 00:28:24.501]  It takes about seven days to kick in.
[00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:27.486]  You got 50% off Brain Force Plus.
[00:28:27.927 --> 00:28:28.708]  We rarely do that.
[00:28:28.768 --> 00:28:31.674]  It's 50% off and you get free shipping when you get those two together.
[00:28:32.708 --> 00:28:33.068]  We're good to go.
[00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:22.851]  We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him and the free system that allowed it to happen in American history.
[00:29:23.352 --> 00:29:32.237]  From the highest levels of government to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us.
[00:29:32.797 --> 00:29:37.699]  But the ultimate insult is that they think we're so stupid that we'll let them get away with it.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:54.527]  These saboteurs, slashing away with their leaks and sneers, their phony accusations and gagging sanctimony, drive their daggers through the heart of our future, poisoning our belief that honest custody of our institutions will ever again be possible.
[00:29:55.128 --> 00:29:59.170]  So they can then build their utopia from the ashes of what they burned down.
[00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:00.090]  No.
[00:30:00.631 --> 00:30:06.258]  Their fate will be failure, and they will perish in the political flames of their own fires.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.308]  We are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedom's safest place.
[00:30:13.348 --> 00:30:16.031]  You know, I just heard that National Rifle Association ad.
[00:30:17.212 --> 00:30:21.035]  Airing on the radio side, TV side.
[00:30:21.075 --> 00:30:24.037]  We had a video ad going with Dana Lash.
[00:30:24.057 --> 00:30:25.258]  I always call her Losh.
[00:30:26.078 --> 00:30:26.999]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:27.760]  Dana Lash.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.721]  Great, smart, syndicated radio host.
[00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:31.082]  Great lady.
[00:30:31.622 --> 00:30:33.363]  Very successful spokesperson for the NRA.
[00:30:33.383 --> 00:30:38.127]  But the left wants to basically kill and says she's a witch and burn her, literally.
[00:30:39.748 --> 00:30:43.710]  They heard that ad running and Media Matters wrote stories about it.
[00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:45.572]  George Soros' outfit.
[00:30:46.693 --> 00:30:51.095]  Saying, oh look, the National Rifle Association is spending money with Alex Jones.
[00:30:51.175 --> 00:30:54.057]  Like, they're the arbiter, they're the boss, they're the god.
[00:30:54.077 --> 00:30:56.798]  If they say it's bad, it's bad.
[00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:58.419]  No, morons.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.180]  I like that ad.
[00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:03.602]  So, I have part of the radio ads on the network.
[00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:05.283]  So, I run that ad.
[00:31:05.603 --> 00:31:07.604]  Even though one of those ads is about $1,000 a minute, I run it.
[00:31:11.277 --> 00:31:12.217]  And eat $1,000 every time.
[00:31:12.798 --> 00:31:13.638]  Comprende?
[00:31:14.898 --> 00:31:16.798]  I pay to air the NRA.
[00:31:17.899 --> 00:31:18.499]  Figure that out?
[00:31:19.339 --> 00:31:20.799]  So you guys don't get it, do you?
[00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:22.900]  I'm not doing this for money.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.100]  I'm not doing this for myself.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.081]  I don't sit there and calculate the work I do about me personally.
[00:31:29.441 --> 00:31:31.422]  It's about my children and the future.
[00:31:32.082 --> 00:31:32.962]  I'm a kamikaze.
[00:31:33.976 --> 00:31:35.837]  I don't care what you do to me financially.
[00:31:36.137 --> 00:31:37.478]  I don't care how you come after me.
[00:31:37.658 --> 00:31:38.558]  I'm committed.
[00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:42.961]  Because I know you're bad people and I want to get you off of our collective backs.
[00:31:45.762 --> 00:31:49.024]  Isn't that something you can now understand, dumbos?
[00:32:02.188 --> 00:32:04.030]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.411]  Go ahead.
[00:32:05.312 --> 00:32:07.214]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:32:07.254 --> 00:32:17.586]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:32:17.767 --> 00:32:21.131]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:32:21.591 --> 00:32:21.891]  Absolutely.
[00:32:44.328 --> 00:32:57.294]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:33:06.438 --> 00:33:09.120]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.465 --> 00:33:22.470]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.766 --> 00:33:43.448]  Alright, I'm going to get into
[00:33:46.411 --> 00:33:55.875]  The demands of the UN-funded, that's admitted, globalist caravan organization that leads people into the United States.
[00:33:55.915 --> 00:33:59.417]  They have similar groups, obviously, in Europe, out of Syria.
[00:33:59.437 --> 00:34:09.482]  That's why it was important to bring down Syria during the last five years of the war, because even though they never fully toppled the government or the system, they were able to get
[00:34:10.618 --> 00:34:25.908]  Corridors into Turkey who then took the select groups and put them into Europe and now Erdogan has threatened to use them as a weapon system to quote burn down Europe if they don't let Turkey parties and most European countries are parliamentary.
[00:34:25.928 --> 00:34:30.712]  Even though there's maybe 5-10% of the population Islamic groups are.
[00:34:30.732 --> 00:34:36.896]  Erdogan can then direct them and throw elections either way when you've got 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 different parties.
[00:34:40.365 --> 00:34:46.047]  That's how Merkel still stays in power even though her party's 30-something percent of the voters.
[00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:57.310]  And the seats, there's so many other parties and then they keep making coalitions because her party's still in control so they can give money to the other groups and basically buy off their leaders.
[00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:02.792]  So that's how you can have minority rule in something like a parliamentary system.
[00:35:02.812 --> 00:35:04.953]  That's why parliamentary systems are very, very dangerous.
[00:35:06.573 --> 00:35:08.314]  That's why our system, I believe, is superior.
[00:35:09.281 --> 00:35:12.162]  But we'll get more into that and their demands.
[00:35:12.202 --> 00:35:18.405]  But Nico, the lead producer, pointed out to me during the break, he goes, you know, you never talk about the studies.
[00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:25.487]  And you never get into these products where we're able to get into studies about them and their ingredients.
[00:35:25.607 --> 00:35:26.288]  Why don't you do that?
[00:35:26.348 --> 00:35:26.908]  I said, what do you mean?
[00:35:26.928 --> 00:35:37.052]  He goes, well, you just say the amazing benefits of turmeric and bodies is the strongest out there, has a 95% curcumin in rate, leading competitors 3%, because they just don't care.
[00:35:39.195 --> 00:35:40.276]  It's just watered down crap.
[00:35:40.456 --> 00:35:44.157]  Ours is the strongest we believe you can get.
[00:35:44.177 --> 00:35:51.181]  That's why we have a limited supply of it right now, because we couldn't even get enough to have it at the 95% rate, which is the highest recorded out there.
[00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:53.022]  We want the highest.
[00:35:54.062 --> 00:35:55.143]  Here's an article, Daily Mail.
[00:35:55.943 --> 00:35:58.064]  Is turmeric really a wonder drug for migraines?
[00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:06.889]  The spice, which has been a staple in India and Southeast Asian meals for thousands of years, has become hugely popular in recent years for its many health benefits.
[00:36:07.776 --> 00:36:10.719]  from lowering heart disease risk to clearing up bad skin.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:16.905]  Increasingly, it's also been seen as a way to relieve head pain, sinus issues.
[00:36:18.246 --> 00:36:21.830]  Its active ingredient has an anti-inflammatory effect and is a strong antioxidant.
[00:36:22.881 --> 00:36:30.568]  Here researchers, doctors and nutritionists weigh on the science behind it, decide whether turmeric really is a wonder drug that can cure or prevent migraines.
[00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:37.795]  Research on whether turmeric and curcumin, and again that's the curcuminoids, can cure or prevent migraines has been mixed, and it just goes into it.
[00:36:39.129 --> 00:37:08.489]  But it goes on migraines characterized by throbbing and pulsating pain impact millions of people Registered dietary nutritionist and it goes into all the different perspectives different issues But what we know is it is an amazing anti-inflammatory that migraines are associated with inflammation on the brain It's like Alzheimer's so many other issues And all I know is with allergies and things if I take my bodies If I take the pollen block
[00:37:10.327 --> 00:37:16.232]  It goes from me having a pounding headache during the really, really bad seasonal distress times to feeling pretty good.
[00:37:17.312 --> 00:37:19.074]  My problem is I forget to take it.
[00:37:20.495 --> 00:37:21.636]  And it's the same thing.
[00:37:21.696 --> 00:37:28.101]  When I take TX2, when I'm tired and gotta keep working, I don't have that third cup of coffee, you know, at six or seven at night.
[00:37:28.161 --> 00:37:29.302]  I have a brain force.
[00:37:30.803 --> 00:37:32.984]  Now, if I take two brain force, I've become a jerk.
[00:37:34.005 --> 00:37:35.586]  But it is strong.
[00:37:35.626 --> 00:37:36.947]  It's something totally different than coffee.
[00:37:36.967 --> 00:37:37.688]  It's all natural.
[00:37:38.068 --> 00:37:38.589]  It's amazing.
[00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:39.950]  And I am plugging here because
[00:37:42.503 --> 00:37:48.247]  They're going over us with a fine-tooth comb, trying to shut us down, just like they're trying to shut down the President.
[00:37:48.267 --> 00:37:52.549]  He has thousands of lawsuits against him, and it's total harassment.
[00:37:53.750 --> 00:38:01.295]  We have this stuff, and even again, BuzzFeed and the Daily Beast and others say, yeah, this is very frivolous.
[00:38:01.515 --> 00:38:03.116]  It's going to be a slapback.
[00:38:03.156 --> 00:38:05.958]  He can definitely shoo the person back.
[00:38:06.999 --> 00:38:07.839]  This is bizarre.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.382]  They said that we didn't do the retraction within the 30 days.
[00:38:11.442 --> 00:38:11.822]  We did.
[00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:12.979]  I don't
[00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:40.493]  People are being told that there's slapback provisions that are very very strong for the person that files the suit to not just have to pay attorney's fees, but pay serious damages.
[00:38:41.114 --> 00:38:44.435]  And there it is, even in the Daily Beast.
[00:38:46.816 --> 00:38:48.197]  Guys, go up a couple paragraphs.
[00:38:48.397 --> 00:38:49.998]  I'll actually read where they talk about it.
[00:38:50.038 --> 00:38:51.458]  I'll just read it from my article I have right here.
[00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:52.579]  This is the part.
[00:38:53.019 --> 00:38:55.560]  Falsely accused Parkland school shooters.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.561]  Sues Alex Jones for InfoWars Reformation.
[00:38:58.061 --> 00:38:58.261]  Again,
[00:39:00.256 --> 00:39:14.673]  We never said the guy's name who's picture was circulating the internet news articles as Cruz, as Nicholas Cruz.
[00:39:16.423 --> 00:39:24.028]  Weeks before we ever got a letter, the day of the shooting on Valentine's Day, we took his picture down once the real picture of Cruz came out just hours later.
[00:39:24.048 --> 00:39:27.231]  And that's all there.
[00:39:28.371 --> 00:39:32.554]  And they just say in the lawsuit, you didn't take it down, you didn't retract, correct?
[00:39:33.055 --> 00:39:33.695]  Yeah, we did.
[00:39:33.715 --> 00:39:36.617]  Under Texas code, it's thrown out.
[00:39:36.697 --> 00:39:37.358]  Summary judgment.
[00:39:37.978 --> 00:39:41.921]  And then you read the lawsuit, though, it's got all this other stuff that wasn't from our website.
[00:39:42.362 --> 00:39:43.523]  And we know where it's from.
[00:39:43.563 --> 00:39:44.964]  It's from 4chan and other sites.
[00:39:45.384 --> 00:39:46.445]  And they're just saying it's us.
[00:39:47.366 --> 00:39:56.993]  And my own lawyers said this is a political stunt, just like all the others, to associate you with lawsuits and lies and failure when the Democratic Party's collapsing, CNN's collapsing.
[00:39:58.054 --> 00:39:59.896]  Mainstream media has already gone bankrupt.
[00:40:00.036 --> 00:40:01.977]  All the big major newspapers are up for sale.
[00:40:02.317 --> 00:40:05.180]  The New York Times is propped up by a Mexican kingpin.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.962]  Associated with all sorts of issues.
[00:40:09.642 --> 00:40:17.790]  You've got Bezos, and he just lost $30 billion last week for all the stuff he's involved in, controlling the failed Washington Post, using it as a weapon.
[00:40:18.691 --> 00:40:21.413]  Who, by the way, is celebrating this against us.
[00:40:21.453 --> 00:40:25.437]  But even the Daily Beast in here,
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.702]  And I'm not going to say the name of the guy whose picture got wrongly associated with this.
[00:40:32.343 --> 00:40:35.345]  We took it down, we corrected it, we apologized, but no one else did.
[00:40:35.365 --> 00:40:36.385]  It was on thousands of sites.
[00:40:37.906 --> 00:40:45.231]  But... The media picking this up, it's the first time I've ever heard of this guy's name.
[00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:48.093]  The claim that we popularized his name is not true.
[00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:54.857]  And it goes into it here in the article.
[00:41:00.137 --> 00:41:05.621]  Ken White, a First Amendment litigator at Brown, White, and Osborne said the suit could run afoul of Texas state law.
[00:41:06.762 --> 00:41:12.707]  Oh yeah, because we have the correction, retraction, in 30 days.
[00:41:12.747 --> 00:41:14.148]  Right there, statutorily, it's gone.
[00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.051]  It's crazy, Tom.
[00:41:17.691 --> 00:41:18.872]  It continues.
[00:41:19.973 --> 00:41:28.300]  The core of the lawsuit, that Infowars falsely accused Mr. Fontaine of being the shooter, states a very plausible claim for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
[00:41:29.864 --> 00:41:30.805]  White told the Daily Beast.
[00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:38.870]  The problem is that the complaint buries that core wrong into a general attack on InfoWars and Alex Jones and their fans.
[00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:40.511]  That's a huge political statement.
[00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.832]  Just like the Georgetown lawsuit.
[00:41:42.312 --> 00:41:45.234]  That might make for good press, but it's dangerous.
[00:41:46.134 --> 00:41:46.895]  White continued.
[00:41:47.395 --> 00:41:48.796]  He's a very respected lawyer, by the way.
[00:41:48.836 --> 00:41:50.517]  That's why even the Daily Beast had to quote him.
[00:41:50.937 --> 00:41:53.319]  Texas has a very strong anti-slap law.
[00:41:53.819 --> 00:41:54.460]  If InfoWars
[00:41:55.717 --> 00:42:10.040]  Contrained the lawsuit as being more broadly about the content of its speech in general or about the speech of a third party commentators for whom InfoWars is not responsible under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the plaintiff faces a real risk of anti-SLAPP ruling.
[00:42:11.101 --> 00:42:20.883]  And then it goes into the SLAPP, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, refers to strategic frivolous lawsuits designed to silence particular categories of speech.
[00:42:22.343 --> 00:42:23.484]  In the D.C.
[00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:24.224]  suit against me,
[00:42:25.805 --> 00:42:33.929]  That's what's so crazy about Georgetown, which lawyers have never seen a free speech lab do this because it's taxpayer funded.
[00:42:34.509 --> 00:42:37.311]  It says they want to silence me and stop all my speech.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.681]  And that I'm a horrible person and says a bunch of stuff I didn't say.
[00:42:41.701 --> 00:42:43.081]  That defames me.
[00:42:43.842 --> 00:42:45.402]  And this suit says that stuff too.
[00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:48.443]  That's what's next level, folks.
[00:42:48.924 --> 00:42:51.865]  They really think, the Democrats and stuff, they're gonna get rid of free speech.
[00:42:52.185 --> 00:42:53.045]  And then it goes into all this.
[00:42:53.065 --> 00:43:00.548]  They admit that's what this is, is to shut up what we're doing and saying by misrepresenting something we did that we didn't do.
[00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:04.269]  There is an issue.
[00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:06.770]  There is a movement.
[00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.511]  There is a phenomenon.
[00:43:09.608 --> 00:43:10.708]  Taking place right now.
[00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:16.309]  That is the number one issue on this planet.
[00:43:17.449 --> 00:43:20.410]  Not just for humanity, but for all life forms.
[00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:36.433]  Now, I've been on air more than 23 years, but only now, studying how we're attacked by mainstream media, and by globalists, and by major governments, do I understand the whole continuum.
[00:43:37.133 --> 00:43:37.593]  The ballgame.
[00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:51.841]  So this is some of the most important information you're ever going to see or hear, and it's up to you, if you care about yourself and your family, and if you're conscious, if you're not an animal, as the globalists think you are, if you're not dead inside, to listen to me.
[00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:58.783]  I noticed in the last decade, the number one thing mainstream media will attack me for
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:08.023]  Is when I talk about how the human species, through fluoride and through atrazine and through thousands of other chemicals, is being changed.
[00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:12.864]  Our IQs are being lowered, our sexuality is being confused, our fertility is being destroyed.
[00:44:12.884 --> 00:44:13.805]  And it's a fact.
[00:44:14.925 --> 00:44:26.469]  And I just noticed in the last few years, with all the late night comedy shows and all the Comedy Central shows and the newspapers, 80% of the attacks, including two, in the last 24 hours,
[00:44:28.152 --> 00:44:38.645]  Are when I show people Berkeley and Harvard and Princeton and Yale and Cambridge and all these groups.
[00:44:39.708 --> 00:44:49.015]  Saying the manipulation of the genetics and the hormones, the sexuality of amphibians and fish and mammals and everything is out of control.
[00:44:49.796 --> 00:44:56.220]  Amphibians are collapsing, fish are collapsing, they are asexual or bisexual or they are deformed.
[00:44:57.721 --> 00:45:04.887]  The male frogs, just under a little bit of atrazine, go over to the male frogs, their olfactory's changed, try to have sex with them when they can't, they're dying.
[00:45:05.956 --> 00:45:14.006]  And we would cover that and they would attack it and say we said it when I was actually holding up mainline journals saying it's making the frogs quote gay.
[00:45:14.026 --> 00:45:17.229]  You know, using that term to get people to look at it.
[00:45:18.411 --> 00:45:22.836]  And then I look, just last 24 hours, David Hogg, the spokesperson for gun control,
[00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:33.765]  And, you know, shows with Stephen Colbert and Thomas Middleditch claiming that I'm attacking him for being a beta male when they had a big magazine cover saying the triumph of the beta male.
[00:45:34.145 --> 00:45:36.426]  I was saying they're mainlining and pushing the beta male.
[00:45:36.726 --> 00:45:40.047]  I wasn't attacking Mr. Middleditch or Mike Judge, who's a good friend of mine.
[00:45:40.087 --> 00:45:41.707]  I think Silicon Valley is a really funny show.
[00:45:42.388 --> 00:45:49.470]  I was just saying the media is pushing all this and then misrepresenting what I've said because they don't want you looking at it.
[00:45:49.830 --> 00:46:07.485]  They don't want you researching it, because the additives and the chemicals and the whole deal is in the UN UNESCO founding documents in 1947, the same year we got the National Security Act, to carry out this eugenics transhumanist operation.
[00:46:07.885 --> 00:46:14.931]  For example, on Infowars, one of his most famous statements was saying that tap water is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too.
[00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:16.573]  First off, gay people are awesome.
[00:46:16.693 --> 00:46:18.074]  I don't think that's a problem at all.
[00:46:18.374 --> 00:46:22.458]  Alex Jones said, the globalists are teaching us to turn off our life force.
[00:46:23.279 --> 00:46:30.005]  It's a camouflage so the alpha males that are still left don't notice they're being taken control of and being enslaved.
[00:46:30.186 --> 00:46:30.506]  Yeah.
[00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:31.847]  Is this true?
[00:46:31.907 --> 00:46:32.988]  Is this true?
[00:46:33.048 --> 00:46:34.610]  Are you enslaving the alpha males?
[00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.690]  Because you know I consider myself a bit of an alpha male.
[00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:37.211]  Oh really?
[00:46:37.931 --> 00:46:40.471]  Do you want to debate it or just let them make a big joke out of it?
[00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:43.672]  Because they're scared of us having a discussion.
[00:46:43.952 --> 00:46:48.033]  And I didn't realize this was the heart of their operation until they attacked me so hard.
[00:46:48.453 --> 00:46:54.874]  Almost all their attacks every day are based on this because they want you to not look around you and see what's happening.
[00:46:55.454 --> 00:46:57.635]  What do you as viewers and listeners think we should do?
[00:47:05.894 --> 00:47:08.503]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:18.484 --> 00:47:21.987]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:47:22.547 --> 00:47:24.368]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:28.411]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:47:29.031 --> 00:47:31.293]  Run on for a long time.
[00:47:31.693 --> 00:47:36.156]  So, InfoWars is right up there at the highest level of being under attack.
[00:47:36.797 --> 00:47:38.218]  We're under more attack than Laura Ingraham.
[00:47:38.238 --> 00:47:39.739]  We're under more attack than Sean Hannity.
[00:47:39.759 --> 00:47:45.223]  We're under more attack than anybody but the President and Drudge Report.
[00:47:46.553 --> 00:48:06.034]  Now, Drudge doesn't get attacked a lot in the open, but at the Federal Elections Commission, and at the Congressional level, and at the FCC level, they have said they want to shut him down and take him over, and in the George Soros documents and the UN documents, they are more obsessed with Drudge than even myself.
[00:48:07.108 --> 00:48:08.049]  And they want to silence him.
[00:48:08.729 --> 00:48:11.090]  So he's got the really serious hidden stuff.
[00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.593]  But people know Drudge is just lynx and his occasional commentary and exclusives.
[00:48:15.913 --> 00:48:18.314]  So they know people don't buy going after him.
[00:48:18.875 --> 00:48:21.636]  He isn't a good target for going after free speech.
[00:48:21.676 --> 00:48:23.297]  So the attacks on him are covert.
[00:48:25.198 --> 00:48:25.699]  Now there it is.
[00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:30.341]  FCC chair warns that conservative media like Drudge Report and Sean Hannity will face regulation.
[00:48:30.682 --> 00:48:32.923]  That's because they came within one vote.
[00:48:35.177 --> 00:48:38.499]  Of shutting Drudge down saying he was involved in campaigns.
[00:48:42.101 --> 00:48:43.361]  So, it really is incredible.
[00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:48.664]  Now, speaking of being under attack, it's on Infowars.com, it's on Newswars.com.
[00:48:49.904 --> 00:49:00.690]  I saw some of Jim Carrey's art about a week ago, and I actually went to his site and spent about 10 minutes looking at it, and I gotta say, some of his art, I would say is really, really good.
[00:49:03.942 --> 00:49:13.994]  And then I was going to invite him on the show, and even though I know he doesn't like the broadcast, and see if he wanted to have a debate.
[00:49:14.794 --> 00:49:18.579]  Because, I mean, I know, good art when I see it, he is a good political cartoonist.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.745]  Well, Jim Carrey attacks Alex Jones and Sean Hannity in latest art piece.
[00:49:27.245 --> 00:49:30.687]  Once you show the one supposedly with Trump and Stormy Daniels, that's a good one too.
[00:49:31.247 --> 00:49:32.268]  Again, we're a radio show.
[00:49:32.628 --> 00:49:33.909]  We also simulcast on TV.
[00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:37.251]  If you're listening to us, driving down the road, you're going, what do you mean, look at this, look at that.
[00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:40.513]  We have live streams at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:44.655]  But please, whatever you do, I mean, you got to admit that's good art.
[00:49:48.478 --> 00:49:51.019]  Please support our local affiliates as well and spread the word about those.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.582]  But there's a new attack piece and we'll get into it in a moment.
[00:49:56.786 --> 00:49:58.387]  But, Jim Carrey's a funny guy.
[00:49:58.407 --> 00:50:02.991]  He was married to McCarthy, and I think it's his son with her, or maybe he was just married to her.
[00:50:03.011 --> 00:50:03.752]  She has an autistic son.
[00:50:03.772 --> 00:50:04.412]  She's been on before.
[00:50:04.432 --> 00:50:05.093]  I've been on her show.
[00:50:05.934 --> 00:50:06.114]  But...
[00:50:07.853 --> 00:50:09.554]  You know vaccines are damaging people.
[00:50:09.594 --> 00:50:10.454]  The documents are in.
[00:50:10.494 --> 00:50:11.214]  The facts are in.
[00:50:11.894 --> 00:50:14.155]  And I'm somebody that's exposing that.
[00:50:14.535 --> 00:50:16.336]  And I'm exposing chemicals in the water.
[00:50:16.356 --> 00:50:18.377]  And I'm exposing globalism.
[00:50:18.417 --> 00:50:20.698]  And I'm exposing the Arab Spring and really bad stuff.
[00:50:20.758 --> 00:50:24.339]  So, Kerry gets up there and talks about the Illuminati and the New World Order.
[00:50:24.359 --> 00:50:27.480]  And I've never really reached out to him because I kind of tune Hollywood out.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:36.043]  But I want to know if it's all an act or if he's really that crazy.
[00:50:39.315 --> 00:50:42.636]  I don't know what he's up to, but I would like to challenge him to come on the show.
[00:50:42.656 --> 00:50:44.577]  You know, Roseanne Barr says, I woke her up.
[00:50:44.597 --> 00:50:46.478]  She came on a few times years ago.
[00:50:46.498 --> 00:50:47.958]  She's been talking to Daria.
[00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:48.818]  She says she'll come on.
[00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:55.501]  And I am interested in celebrities when they're controversial, when they have something interesting to say, when they're going against the grain.
[00:50:56.901 --> 00:50:59.402]  Kerry has done that some in his career, but now he's not.
[00:50:59.422 --> 00:51:01.263]  He seems to be establishment.
[00:51:02.345 --> 00:51:07.327]  And tries to be ironic and, you know, gets up there and talks about the meaning of life and how empty Hollywood is.
[00:51:07.607 --> 00:51:09.448]  Well, I agree with him on that front.
[00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:15.331]  So, I think he should come on the broadcast.
[00:51:15.991 --> 00:51:17.592]  Jim Carrey attacks Alex Jones.
[00:51:18.452 --> 00:51:19.793]  Hannity in latest art piece.
[00:51:19.833 --> 00:51:22.934]  Meanwhile, corporate media dying as Infowars is exploding.
[00:51:23.494 --> 00:51:26.736]  And that's why they're suing us and lying about us and misrepresenting us.
[00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:29.159]  Is they're dying.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:35.083]  Hollywood's dying, the establishment's dying, mainstream media has already collapsed, and they want to drag us into their hole.
[00:51:35.163 --> 00:51:35.603]  Here's the deal.
[00:51:36.364 --> 00:51:38.425]  You could shut everything down I've got.
[00:51:38.445 --> 00:51:42.427]  It'd take you three, four years, even if you succeed with these suits, which they're not going to.
[00:51:43.788 --> 00:51:48.211]  And I could just declare bankruptcy and step right over to a new company and work for it.
[00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:53.574]  And then legally and lawfully run operations and expose the globalists and get a salary.
[00:51:54.943 --> 00:52:06.003]  The only way you're going to shut me up is killing me or demonizing my name so much that you then get governments to de-platform and Alex Jones is persona non grata and is bought from the internet.
[00:52:06.769 --> 00:52:14.274]  Which they can do with these bots and these algorithms and systems where they'll ban a video and then we try to re-upload it and it's banned.
[00:52:14.294 --> 00:52:16.016]  We try to re-upload it on another account, it's banned.
[00:52:16.496 --> 00:52:20.539]  That's the AI systems they've got in place that would really allow massive censorship.
[00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:25.282]  That's why we all need third-party platforms and individual platforms that are independent.
[00:52:25.622 --> 00:52:28.925]  Our own and other patriot platforms to fight the establishment.
[00:52:28.965 --> 00:52:30.126]  Matt Drudge is absolutely right.
[00:52:30.366 --> 00:52:31.066]  He was always right.
[00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:31.807]  We should get out of the
[00:52:33.402 --> 00:52:34.203]  Internet ghettos.
[00:52:34.343 --> 00:52:36.524]  And now I know he was right two and a half years ago when he visited.
[00:52:36.604 --> 00:52:39.906]  I said, well, maybe, Matt, we should use the big platforms to build our own.
[00:52:40.806 --> 00:52:43.428]  And he said, it's too late for that on air and off air.
[00:52:43.848 --> 00:52:46.650]  He said, you've got to leave now before the censorship's complete.
[00:52:48.111 --> 00:52:58.977]  And you've got to have all your talent and all your energy and all your articles off their system now before the big clampdown comes or you won't have the big enough platform to challenge it.
[00:52:58.997 --> 00:53:02.099]  And then they'll come after your platform itself, which they're now doing.
[00:53:02.955 --> 00:53:05.378]  So, we're here.
[00:53:05.458 --> 00:53:07.920]  This is the real fight for free speech, the real fight for America.
[00:53:07.941 --> 00:53:22.516]  I'm going to get back in the news, but Hollywood funnyman Jim Carrey tweeted out a drawing of Infowars founder Alex Jones wrestling Fox host Sean Hannity, suggesting their pro-liberty views are as fake as WWE rumbles.
[00:53:23.496 --> 00:53:25.938]  No, I really believe in free speech and the Second Amendment and private property.
[00:53:25.958 --> 00:53:27.780]  My God, look how great it is compared to other countries.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.201]  I mean, I live here, bro.
[00:53:30.062 --> 00:53:35.367]  If you believe wrestling is real, you may believe Fox News Infowars and the robotic drones of Sinclair Broadcasting.
[00:53:35.747 --> 00:53:39.150]  What does Sinclair Broadcasting, with its talking points, have to do with us?
[00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:40.831]  I mean, mainstream media is who's robotic.
[00:53:43.714 --> 00:53:45.676]  And it just goes on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:49.752]  But wrestling doesn't harm viewers.
[00:53:49.792 --> 00:53:55.636]  Performers like Sean Hannity and Alex Jones should join the WWE, where their hyperbole will do less damage to the culture.
[00:53:57.358 --> 00:54:09.486]  The Hour of Humans features Hitler giving a Nazi salute, suggesting Infowars and Alex Jones newspedal a fascist authoritarian ideology, which in reality is emanating from the Lepus culture, such as their constant attacks against the First and Second Amendments.
[00:54:13.429 --> 00:54:14.090]  Well, there you go.
[00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.030]  It just goes on from there.
[00:54:16.337 --> 00:54:17.937]  See the art up on Infowars.com.
[00:54:18.257 --> 00:54:19.178]  We'll tweet it out too.
[00:54:19.538 --> 00:54:21.458]  Hey, I see this as a badge of honor.
[00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:29.080]  That Kerry, he might be on our side trying to be ironic and getting people to pay attention to what's going on.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:33.241]  I mean, there's something weird going on with him or he could just be completely insane.
[00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:39.903]  But I remember his attack on one of my
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.583]  True Hollywood icons because of how hard he worked for the Civil Rights Movement and how hard he worked for the Second Amendment.
[00:54:46.603 --> 00:55:01.252]  Charlton Heston, who was very, very nice to me the few times he came on and spent most of his fortune flying around on his private jet, speaking to high schools, colleges, going on talk radio, fighting for the Second Amendment.
[00:55:01.272 --> 00:55:02.133]  He's such a patriot.
[00:55:02.533 --> 00:55:05.815]  He was involved in the Civil Rights Movement in the late 40s when nobody was.
[00:55:06.806 --> 00:55:10.148]  Not in the late 60s when it was cool and all that had already happened.
[00:55:10.168 --> 00:55:14.951]  And it's just sick how, you know, Kerry attacked him viciously and made fun of him.
[00:55:17.492 --> 00:55:18.973]  So maybe he's just a total scumbag.
[00:55:19.013 --> 00:55:19.334]  I don't know.
[00:55:19.354 --> 00:55:20.834]  But he's done some mixed bag stuff.
[00:55:20.875 --> 00:55:22.756]  It's just really sad.
[00:55:24.297 --> 00:55:25.117]  But there you go!
[00:55:25.137 --> 00:55:26.738]  A Hitler salute to us!
[00:55:27.038 --> 00:55:28.259]  Jim Kerry says so.
[00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:29.380]  So we must be Hitler.
[00:55:32.221 --> 00:55:33.062]  We must be bad.
[00:55:35.672 --> 00:55:47.755]  Now, if you compare David Hogg to Hitler, when he's clicking his heels and giving a fascist salute, you get kicked off YouTube, but... I guess some public figures are more equal than others, huh?
[00:55:49.417 --> 00:55:50.678]  All right, I did not get to it yet.
[00:55:50.718 --> 00:55:55.261]  We will get to it with Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert, who's predicted so much of what's happening.
[00:55:55.301 --> 00:55:58.463]  I'll get into Trump's response to the caravan, the 10th such caravan.
[00:55:58.483 --> 00:56:01.345]  We just know about it now because Trump is opposing it and exposed it.
[00:56:01.405 --> 00:56:02.326]  We'll give you their demands.
[00:56:02.706 --> 00:56:03.907]  I'll get into the latest Russian news.
[00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:09.191]  There's so much, but I want to just say this so it sinks in because I normally just rattle on.
[00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:13.494]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[00:56:15.066 --> 00:56:19.489]  We're all in this together, and they admit that if they can take down InfoWars, they can take us all down.
[00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:21.871]  So, I think America knows that and has responded.
[00:56:21.891 --> 00:56:25.733]  We've gotten a lot of new radio affiliates, a ton of new TV affiliates, a lot of new listeners.
[00:56:25.773 --> 00:56:28.535]  Our traffic is higher this year than it was last year.
[00:56:29.576 --> 00:56:32.618]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google.
[00:56:34.179 --> 00:56:39.082]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:56:39.122 --> 00:56:40.042]  We've beaten six.
[00:56:40.103 --> 00:56:43.405]  Now we've got seven to deal with.
[00:56:45.055 --> 00:56:49.359]  None of them have teeth but one, and that one's got rotten teeth, and we're close to dealing with that one.
[00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:50.800]  I'm going to D.C.
[00:56:51.501 --> 00:56:51.961]  next week.
[00:56:53.082 --> 00:56:58.867]  We've got a big announcement we're going to make sometime today or tomorrow about several big things we've got, so know that's coming up.
[00:56:59.588 --> 00:57:01.550]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:02.971]  You're my soldier.
[00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:03.732]  We're all in this together.
[00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:09.491]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[00:57:09.871 --> 00:57:10.892]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[00:57:10.912 --> 00:57:24.956]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, the podcast, audio streams, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.
[00:57:25.016 --> 00:57:33.478]  And when you financially go to Infowarsstore.com, and when you take advantage of the huge sales and the great products for everything in your life, it's about making your life better,
[00:57:34.178 --> 00:57:39.981]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[00:58:03.171 --> 00:58:04.973]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[00:58:05.033 --> 00:58:12.142]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[00:58:12.563 --> 00:58:18.350]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[00:58:19.031 --> 00:58:20.352]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[00:58:20.953 --> 00:58:30.522]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love.
[00:58:30.762 --> 00:58:40.030]  Because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[00:58:41.091 --> 00:58:45.238]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[00:58:45.558 --> 00:58:48.082]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult.
[00:58:48.162 --> 00:58:50.826]  A lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[00:58:51.226 --> 00:58:52.268]  As above, so below.
[00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:55.673]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[00:58:56.554 --> 00:58:57.635]  Most tiny of scales.
[00:58:58.155 --> 00:58:59.236]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:58:59.656 --> 00:59:01.137]  America is building its wall.
[00:59:01.558 --> 00:59:02.018]  Will it work?
[00:59:02.158 --> 00:59:02.638]  We don't know.
[00:59:03.159 --> 00:59:03.739]  Is Trump right?
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.561]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[00:59:07.021 --> 00:59:13.025]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[00:59:13.386 --> 00:59:19.270]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:26.317]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[00:59:27.078 --> 00:59:42.073]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[00:59:42.734 --> 00:59:45.115]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[00:59:45.755 --> 00:59:48.997]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:49.337 --> 00:59:53.079]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[00:59:54.580 --> 01:00:00.502]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.009 --> 01:00:18.170]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:24.452]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:25.712]  We are back live.
[01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:33.994]  We have Matt Bracken joining us to talk about this whole illegal, alien, globalist-funded caravan that Trump's standing up against that the media is flipping out about.
[01:00:35.635 --> 01:00:39.716]  Also, we have a flashback up on Infowars.com by Ben Warren.
[01:00:40.296 --> 01:00:41.696]  Mexico threatened to flood the U.S.
[01:00:41.716 --> 01:00:43.917]  with illegals if not given a favorable NAFTA deal.
[01:00:44.895 --> 01:00:55.881]  And now Trump is saying you're not going to have a one-sided deal, and Mexico has begun to help flood and open up its border with Guatemala, which is crazy for the national security of either country.
[01:00:56.182 --> 01:00:58.543]  Because Mexico's got its problems in certain zones.
[01:01:00.064 --> 01:01:11.110]  It's on the high end of third world countries, and it's got some of the prettiest places, some of the best food in the world, some of the best art, some of the, you name it.
[01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:13.632]  Some of the best stuff in the world comes from Mexico.
[01:01:14.685 --> 01:01:23.989]  And them opening themselves up to Guatemala and right down into Honduras and all that is insane.
[01:01:24.009 --> 01:01:28.351]  You ever been to Honduras?
[01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:28.791]  I have.
[01:01:30.532 --> 01:01:31.032]  Frightening.
[01:01:32.213 --> 01:01:33.093]  Ever been to Guatemala?
[01:01:35.054 --> 01:01:35.454]  I have.
[01:01:35.955 --> 01:01:36.575]  Terrifying.
[01:01:38.056 --> 01:01:38.716]  Terrifying.
[01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:40.737]  Very beautiful.
[01:01:41.377 --> 01:01:47.000]  Volcanoes and parrots everywhere, but I mean, it is, it is, it is, it is dangerous.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.921]  It's like, the whole country is like the worst parts of Mexico City.
[01:01:51.121 --> 01:01:58.124]  So there's nowhere safe in Guatemala, there's nowhere safe in Honduras, there's nowhere safe as you go south in Venezuela.
[01:02:00.825 --> 01:02:05.067]  And the UN is trying to open a corridor up, up the railways.
[01:02:06.607 --> 01:02:07.427]  We've seen this before.
[01:02:07.467 --> 01:02:08.448]  Obama opened it up.
[01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:11.267]  This is the tenth such caravan by this group.
[01:02:13.668 --> 01:02:15.208]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:19.190]  You know, I don't believe that there's secret elites that are space aliens.
[01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:24.732]  I know the elites believe they're channeling evil spirits, they're off-world entities, and I think that's the Bible, that's demons.
[01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:29.854]  But, you look at Zuckerberg, he does look like a space alien.
[01:02:33.171 --> 01:02:37.652]  Headline, Jones thinks Zuckerberg's a space alien with humanoid slaves on Mars.
[01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:39.833]  Never said that, never joked that, never said any of that.
[01:02:40.913 --> 01:02:45.655]  But look at this, Cruz Challenger raises staggering $6.7 million.
[01:02:47.435 --> 01:02:48.796]  That's way more than Cruz has raised.
[01:02:48.836 --> 01:02:55.638]  I mean, the Democrats are on the warpath, and if we just get on the warpath, we're going to turn the country around, get the economy fixed.
[01:02:55.678 --> 01:02:58.919]  But they knew that they'd artificially shut the economy down to make people dependent.
[01:02:58.959 --> 01:03:00.219]  That's their globalist operation.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.340]  That's their modus operandi.
[01:03:02.293 --> 01:03:04.595]  And so that's why they're so crazy.
[01:03:06.757 --> 01:03:08.579]  And that's why they're pushing so hard.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:18.848]  And that's why they want to hurry up and get control again because they can't have this economy succeed.
[01:03:18.868 --> 01:03:20.309]  They can't have the family succeed.
[01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:21.671]  They can't have any of this succeed.
[01:03:21.711 --> 01:03:23.833]  They have to have poverty to have control.
[01:03:26.255 --> 01:03:28.437]  Dems see hope in the land of Sheriff Joe.
[01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.271]  So, it's just crazy.
[01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:41.515]  And all these Republican establishment people have retired, so the Democrats have a chance to win.
[01:03:43.096 --> 01:03:45.877]  Breaking, we have a drudge siren, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:46.258 --> 01:03:47.978]  This is exactly what I had Matt Bracken on.
[01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:52.601]  I was going to ask Matt Bracken, should we put the military on in a civil emergency?
[01:03:52.701 --> 01:03:57.204]  And that is, just like I said last segment, the President is a dictator when it comes to the border.
[01:03:57.972 --> 01:03:58.773]  And non-citizens.
[01:03:59.554 --> 01:04:00.976]  Trump sending military to the border.
[01:04:01.056 --> 01:04:05.623]  Hey, have the writer screenshot that and get that headline out right now on Infowars.com.
[01:04:06.284 --> 01:04:08.387]  So we have a siren, daily caller.
[01:04:09.729 --> 01:04:12.533]  Trump, we will guard our border with the military.
[01:04:14.304 --> 01:04:16.847]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:18.348]  It is on right now.
[01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.590]  Trump will guard our border with the military.
[01:04:21.051 --> 01:04:23.493]  President Donald Trump said today the U.S.
[01:04:23.513 --> 01:04:26.656]  military will be used to guard the U.S.-Mexico border.
[01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:29.519]  We're going to guard our border with our military.
[01:04:29.539 --> 01:04:31.962]  So please, let's post a blurb of the
[01:04:34.278 --> 01:04:40.082]  of the Daily Caller and then I want to tweet out a box of the live feed and put it on Facebook to let people know this just broke.
[01:04:40.102 --> 01:04:50.048]  We're covering live right now Trump's announcement to put the military on the border to stop the globalist UN attempt to bust our nation wide open.
[01:04:50.868 --> 01:04:51.669]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:51.729 --> 01:04:53.089]  This is the InfoWar.
[01:04:53.209 --> 01:04:54.590]  You are the front lines.
[01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:55.831]  You are the hope.
[01:04:56.251 --> 01:04:57.412]  You are the resistance.
[01:04:57.692 --> 01:04:58.573]  Please stay with us.
[01:04:58.653 --> 01:05:00.134]  We will continue to press the attack.

[01:06:10.655 --> 01:06:18.909]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:25.199 --> 01:06:27.520]  Well, it only happens every once in a while.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.141]  But right now we've got a big siren at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:37.382]  I'm tweeting it out right now at RealAlexJones and at Prison Planet with Paul Watson.
[01:06:38.042 --> 01:06:39.663]  Trump sending military to the border.
[01:06:39.883 --> 01:06:42.183]  Caravan vows march.
[01:06:42.644 --> 01:06:43.644]  A confrontation.
[01:06:44.943 --> 01:06:50.065]  Drudge is also linked to the group's demands that we're also going to be covering.
[01:06:50.085 --> 01:06:53.707]  This is pure UN, pure George Soros, Peter Sutherland.
[01:06:54.087 --> 01:06:54.968]  There are no borders.
[01:06:54.988 --> 01:06:55.988]  You must accept me.
[01:06:56.428 --> 01:06:57.889]  But I'm going to be directed by the UN.
[01:06:57.909 --> 01:07:04.312]  Then I'll be a voting bloc inside your country of globalism for collectivism controlled by the globalists.
[01:07:04.952 --> 01:07:06.433]  A domesticated, controlled group.
[01:07:10.731 --> 01:07:12.832]  So let's go ahead and go over some of this article.
[01:07:12.852 --> 01:07:15.633]  Then we're going to go to Matt Bracken, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:16.313 --> 01:07:19.934]  Trump will guard our border with our military.
[01:07:20.794 --> 01:07:21.035]  U.S.
[01:07:21.055 --> 01:07:27.877]  Border Patrol agents detain undocumented immigrants from Central America after capturing them in a grapefruit orchard.
[01:07:27.917 --> 01:07:28.977]  That's the photo they've got.
[01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:31.918]  We're going to be guarding our border with our military.
[01:07:31.978 --> 01:07:33.859]  That's a big step, Trump told reporters.
[01:07:34.219 --> 01:07:35.179]  We're going to get the video in a moment.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.340]  Gather at the White House.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:44.166]  We cannot have people flowing into our country illegally, disappearing, and by the way, never showing up for court.
[01:07:44.726 --> 01:07:46.467]  Well, they give them like two, three-year notices.
[01:07:46.487 --> 01:07:47.568]  They go, be here in two years.
[01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:50.931]  The president's comments appear to take aim at the current U.S.
[01:07:50.971 --> 01:07:57.936]  policy, which requires border agents to catch and then release family units who arrive at the border for non-contagious countries.
[01:07:58.016 --> 01:07:59.197]  But they let the contagious through.
[01:07:59.237 --> 01:08:00.478]  The Border Patrol's gone public with that.
[01:08:00.858 --> 01:08:03.621]  The plague, TB, you name it.
[01:08:04.241 --> 01:08:06.042]  He also said he had spoken with Secretary of Defense
[01:08:06.966 --> 01:08:09.447]  James Mattis about the use of military to guard the border.
[01:08:09.467 --> 01:08:15.288]  In recent days, Trump has reportedly tweeted about a caravan of illegal immigrants making their way from Honduras to the U.S.
[01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:16.168]  border via Mexico.
[01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:20.749]  The president has threatened to end the NAFTA agreement if Mexican government does not stop the caravan.
[01:08:21.589 --> 01:08:33.312]  Mexican authorities responded to Trump's Sunday threat to kill NAFTA by pledging to disband the caravan and allow some transmitters to apply for asylum in Mexico.
[01:08:34.656 --> 01:08:46.784]  And it goes on, the organization, however, said many members of the group continue marching north to the U.S.-Mexican border if they claim asylum and are with a family unit, they legally must be released into the interior of the country.
[01:08:49.414 --> 01:09:08.208]  This is the 10th time that this group has done this, so the president absolutely needs to mobilize not just the National Guard, he needs to ask the states to call up their state guards under the governors, and they need to be put under federal command in an emergency like this, and that's totally constitutional.
[01:09:09.008 --> 01:09:10.969]  So that's basically the militia needs to be called out.
[01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:14.230]  And now in modern parlance, that's the National Guard and your State Guard.
[01:09:14.531 --> 01:09:15.711]  That's what needs to be done right now.
[01:09:15.771 --> 01:09:19.133]  This is a classical attack to break up our sovereignty.
[01:09:19.773 --> 01:09:21.714]  As I said, we're five years behind Europe.
[01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:24.837]  And they've been doing this in Europe for six, seven years.
[01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:29.682]  Under Obama, three years ago, they launched the beginning of it, calling it the, you know, the children crisis.
[01:09:29.943 --> 01:09:31.524]  But only 17% were under the age of 18.
[01:09:32.365 --> 01:09:39.253]  Many of them had fake ID cards, just like they have 25-year-old men in ninth grade in Sweden raping little girls or getting them as their wives.
[01:09:39.633 --> 01:09:41.855]  And it turns out on the news, they're 25 with beards.
[01:09:42.216 --> 01:09:44.158]  And they say, oh, I'm a little boy, I'm 13.
[01:09:46.107 --> 01:09:48.791]  That's how all this is operating and continuing.
[01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:49.472]  Flashback.
[01:09:49.553 --> 01:09:51.015]  Mexico threatens to flood U.S.
[01:09:51.035 --> 01:09:53.078]  with illegals if not given a favorable NAFTA deal.
[01:09:53.459 --> 01:09:54.621]  Infowars.com.
[01:09:55.242 --> 01:09:56.404]  So that's from last year.
[01:10:00.472 --> 01:10:02.553]  This is all happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:03.213 --> 01:10:11.057]  Now joining us is Matt Bracken, best-selling author, counterterrorism specialist, former Navy SEAL, who's been predicting so much of this.
[01:10:11.077 --> 01:10:12.598]  We'll get into their demands coming up.
[01:10:13.178 --> 01:10:16.900]  This is just classic globalism, but what do you think the President should do?
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:18.361]  What do you think he's probably planning to do?
[01:10:18.421 --> 01:10:20.642]  We know General Kelly was the former head of SOUTHCOM.
[01:10:20.942 --> 01:10:24.343]  He warned of this five years ago, and warned Obama this was coming.
[01:10:24.383 --> 01:10:27.145]  So we know it's a UN globalist plan, Kelly pointed out.
[01:10:28.114 --> 01:10:30.495]  Yeah, this is a very important test, but I think that they're playing into Trump's hand.
[01:10:30.535 --> 01:10:33.916]  I think that Trump is going to be able to make a great show of force at the border.
[01:10:54.634 --> 01:11:01.519]  I think that maybe Ann Coulter was the first that I know of that started talking about using the military to build the wall.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.941]  In fact, you don't really need a wall.
[01:11:05.221 --> 01:11:08.283]  A wall is nice, but it has some disadvantages.
[01:11:08.323 --> 01:11:10.165]  It takes way longer to build.
[01:11:10.645 --> 01:11:11.706]  It's very expensive.
[01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:13.707]  Don't you really just want a big trench and a road?
[01:11:14.468 --> 01:11:17.670]  No, you just need multiple fences the way that the Israelis did it.
[01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:29.680]  You only use the wall where the Israeli border goes right through a built-up urban area, where you have to build a physical obstacle, where there's a building on each side of the street with a big obstacle down the middle.
[01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:35.146]  But out in the countryside, all you need are multiple fence systems with a patrol track in between.
[01:11:35.786 --> 01:11:40.989]  It's actually better than a wall because you can see, you know, the invaders massing on the other side.
[01:11:41.029 --> 01:11:47.813]  A wall gives them room to build a tent city or anything else in the shade right on the other side of the border.
[01:11:48.293 --> 01:11:51.415]  And the biggest advantage, though, of a fence is speed.
[01:11:52.235 --> 01:11:53.536]  This isn't rocket science.
[01:11:53.616 --> 01:12:00.620]  You have contractors that are in the United States building this stuff to ship over to, you know, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria.
[01:12:01.241 --> 01:12:03.582]  It's made to come out of a containerized unit.
[01:12:04.082 --> 01:12:06.744]  You know, you can put the container on the back... Sure, that's what the U.S.
[01:12:06.764 --> 01:12:14.168]  put up around Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, and as you said, these big rollout fences, and then you just have repair crews ready when people try to cut through them.
[01:12:14.972 --> 01:12:19.093]  Right, and the federal government already owns the 100 feet at the border.
[01:12:19.754 --> 01:12:28.716]  So almost all of the border, except in a few places with really tough topography, almost all of the border already has a vehicle path that runs parallel to the border.
[01:12:29.777 --> 01:12:37.439]  So if Trump doesn't, all he's got to do is cite the Constitution, Article 4, Section 4,
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:53.014]  The president is obliged to give all, I'm paraphrasing, to ensure that all the states have a Republican form of government, meaning that a state can't, you know, just vote in a tyrant and then get rid of the Constitution.
[01:12:53.534 --> 01:12:59.621]  But the president is also told that he must secure all of the states against invasion.
[01:13:00.322 --> 01:13:05.587]  And something that bugs me to no end is, you know, we always surrender on the language.
[01:13:06.128 --> 01:13:11.373]  An invasion, when we think of an invasion, yeah, we think of Normandy or Okinawa, Iwo Jima.
[01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:13.214]  But this is a classic usurpation.
[01:13:13.234 --> 01:13:19.280]  And as you said, in the Constitution, the president, when it comes to invasions and things on the border, is a dictator.
[01:13:19.841 --> 01:13:22.043]  That's the executive branch's main purview, is the border.
[01:13:22.063 --> 01:13:24.085]  So he has massive power at the border.
[01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:32.172]  Yeah, and in history it's not that often that you have a massive Normandy invasion.
[01:13:32.773 --> 01:13:39.238]  Much more common and much more permanent and dangerous is a demographic stealth invasion.
[01:13:39.698 --> 01:13:47.183]  The Roman Empire, this is in the late Roman Empire, I think like in the 400s, the Roman Empire was taken down by refugees.
[01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:50.246]  The Visigoths were fleeing from the Huns
[01:13:50.986 --> 01:13:53.647]  They moved into the Roman Empire.
[01:13:54.587 --> 01:13:56.888]  They were told, you can come, but don't bring your weapons.
[01:13:56.928 --> 01:13:58.289]  They brought the weapons anyway.
[01:13:59.229 --> 01:14:02.250]  And not long after that, they're attacking and sacking Rome.
[01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:03.270]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:04.831]  It took a couple hundred years.
[01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:07.272]  And they put the Germans in the Visigoths.
[01:14:09.159 --> 01:14:12.541]  In control, they brought them into the Roman Senate.
[01:14:12.961 --> 01:14:16.422]  They did it all, but in the end, they still sacked it and all burned it down.
[01:14:16.802 --> 01:14:17.963]  And history's repeating, you're right.
[01:14:18.563 --> 01:14:25.906]  Most of the time, it is collapsing areas, collapsing regions that cause huge migrant floods that ends up collapsing civilizations.
[01:14:26.747 --> 01:14:31.749]  Or it can be deliberate, like in the Islamic form of conquest, they call it hijrah.
[01:14:32.882 --> 01:14:39.164]  Uh, sometimes you see it spelled hijara, but hijra, they have mosques in America called like, you know, the hijra mosque.
[01:14:39.644 --> 01:14:42.465]  Hijra means demographic invasion.
[01:14:42.505 --> 01:14:43.846]  We're coming to take you over.
[01:14:44.226 --> 01:14:48.227]  We're not doing it on swords, you know, on horseback with swords this time.
[01:14:48.747 --> 01:15:07.804]  We're doing it with bringing in refugees, all of the women have five or six kids each, raised in an insulated Islamic little enclave, to be pure Islamic, to not consider themselves to be American, to consider themselves pioneers of Islam.
[01:15:07.824 --> 01:15:14.229]  They're there to plant the Islamic flag and spread their enclave out until Sharia rules the entire world.
[01:15:14.269 --> 01:15:15.010]  And that's what's happening?
[01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:16.111]  That's a Hezbollah invasion.
[01:15:16.392 --> 01:15:17.378]  That's what's happening in Europe.
[01:15:17.459 --> 01:15:19.511]  They admit it is an Islamic invasion.
[01:15:20.407 --> 01:15:22.869]  Yes, and right now it's Honduras.
[01:15:22.929 --> 01:15:24.710]  These people are the pawns currently.
[01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:32.295]  If you read their open letter, you know, it's all full of communist garbage, you know, talking about the collective and so forth.
[01:15:32.675 --> 01:15:34.036]  So you know who's behind this.
[01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:42.621]  It's an alliance right now in the world between the Islamic Jihad forces and the left wing.
[01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:46.944]  They don't call themselves communists anymore, but they are, you know, the leftists.
[01:15:47.564 --> 01:15:53.608]  They together are supporting this globalist takeover of the world and America is the biggest obstacle in their way.
[01:15:53.968 --> 01:15:54.348]  That's right.
[01:15:54.388 --> 01:15:58.131]  Let's look at their unbelievable globalist UN slash communist demands.
[01:15:58.211 --> 01:16:01.273]  It's right out of the Central Politburo on the other side.
[01:16:01.293 --> 01:16:02.773]  Faith.
[01:16:03.214 --> 01:16:08.117]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available
[01:16:09.284 --> 01:16:17.486]  Books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:16:19.967 --> 01:16:26.068]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[01:16:27.489 --> 01:16:30.009]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[01:16:30.809 --> 01:16:34.230]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:37.291]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[01:16:39.045 --> 01:16:44.247]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:52.789]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:54.750]  It's up to us personally.
[01:16:56.130 --> 01:17:02.973]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:17:03.493 --> 01:17:04.793]  I expected that to happen.
[01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:07.294]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:17:09.301 --> 01:17:20.227]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:22.468]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:34.795]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[01:17:35.375 --> 01:17:37.557]  And we've already come so far together
[01:17:38.581 --> 01:17:47.609]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:53.594]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[01:17:54.715 --> 01:18:02.603]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:13.077]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[01:18:13.478 --> 01:18:15.059]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.723]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[01:18:19.523 --> 01:18:21.345]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[01:18:21.365 --> 01:18:26.269]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:38.127]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[01:18:38.207 --> 01:18:42.173]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[01:18:43.573 --> 01:18:44.233]  Our game is changing.
[01:19:00.484 --> 01:19:03.767]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[01:19:03.787 --> 01:19:04.848]  It just does incredible things.
[01:19:05.269 --> 01:19:06.730]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:09.733]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[01:19:09.753 --> 01:19:12.336]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:19:12.816 --> 01:19:17.641]  That's 4-5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[01:19:18.282 --> 01:19:20.945]  We now have not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue
[01:19:21.665 --> 01:19:29.389]  Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of oil silver out there.
[01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:36.734]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[01:19:36.774 --> 01:19:38.074]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:39.455]  You can swallow it as well.
[01:19:39.855 --> 01:19:45.839]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:46.459 --> 01:19:47.839]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:19:47.859 --> 01:19:57.443]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:19:57.763 --> 01:20:00.824]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:20:06.406 --> 01:20:09.067]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:21.544]  Big Brother.
[01:20:22.885 --> 01:20:24.166]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:25.668 --> 01:20:26.789]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:29.231]  You want answers?
[01:20:30.172 --> 01:20:31.934]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:32.094 --> 01:20:38.400]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.464 --> 01:20:49.971]  Now, Matt Bracken originally wanted to come on about something that in all his years on my show and doing his own broadcast and things, he's never said we're under this much peril.
[01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.132]  And that's in the next segment.
[01:20:51.952 --> 01:21:02.920]  He has really been accurate in predicting other false flags and other staged events and other events that they've allowed to happen or fomented the atmosphere and the climate where they know statistically it's going to happen.
[01:21:03.741 --> 01:21:05.182]  And then they don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:21:05.202 --> 01:21:06.363]  So that's coming up in the critical
[01:21:07.628 --> 01:21:12.875]  Next segment he sent me some very important notes here that we're going to be going over and I absolutely concur with what he's saying.
[01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:14.537]  So that's that's going to be coming up.
[01:21:15.077 --> 01:21:22.226]  Here is the president just 20 minutes ago speaking to reporters about putting military on the border and being prepared to do it.
[01:21:22.246 --> 01:21:22.527]  Here it is.
[01:21:27.717 --> 01:21:30.100]  Mexico has got to help us at the border.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:35.325]  If they're not going to help us at the border, it's a very sad thing.
[01:21:35.746 --> 01:21:39.009]  Mexico has got to help us at the border.
[01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:42.653]  And a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA.
[01:21:43.574 --> 01:21:45.075]  And we're going to have to really see.
[01:21:45.095 --> 01:21:46.416]  They had a great chance.
[01:21:46.516 --> 01:21:47.637]  The Democrats blew it.
[01:21:48.258 --> 01:21:49.479]  They had a great, great chance.
[01:21:50.179 --> 01:21:51.280]  But we'll have to take a look.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.922]  But Mexico has got to help us at the border.
[01:21:54.582 --> 01:21:55.883]  They blow right through Mexico.
[01:21:55.923 --> 01:21:57.885]  They send them into the United States.
[01:21:58.205 --> 01:22:00.086]  Can't hop in that way anymore.
[01:22:00.146 --> 01:22:00.547]  Thank you.
[01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:03.349]  Now that's the first clip from about three hours ago.
[01:22:03.369 --> 01:22:04.510]  We've got the other clip.
[01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:07.912]  We're going to play that coming up of him talking about the military, but we just read you the quote.
[01:22:08.353 --> 01:22:14.037]  But here's another clip of when we caught drugs coming across the border, the first time that bigs even went down there.
[01:22:14.777 --> 01:22:17.519]  Then they even tried to break into their hotel rooms and stuff, so I pulled them out.
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:22.243]  This is the Texas border with obviously marijuana being brought across.
[01:22:23.264 --> 01:22:25.405]  The FBI came and met with us about it and confirmed it was.
[01:22:26.345 --> 01:22:29.548]  So while we're there, you probably read it.
[01:22:29.568 --> 01:22:30.048]  It was in Drudge.
[01:22:30.088 --> 01:22:31.209]  Who's great, by the way.
[01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:32.230]  Drudge is amazing.
[01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:35.092]  But the story in Drudge, and big story, it's all over the place, man.
[01:22:35.112 --> 01:22:36.853]  Guys swimming across, and big bags of stuff.
[01:22:36.873 --> 01:22:37.013]  Drugs.
[01:22:37.714 --> 01:22:38.555]  Swimming across.
[01:22:57.388 --> 01:22:59.129]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:00.530]  They're jumping in.
[01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:01.531]  They just jumped in the rafts.
[01:23:01.891 --> 01:23:03.132]  They're coming up 1, 2, 3, 4.
[01:23:04.273 --> 01:23:05.734]  They have big satchels.
[01:23:06.775 --> 01:23:12.359]  And actually the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[01:23:13.179 --> 01:23:14.700]  Because they're showing this on camera.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.281]  The guys are carrying bags of stuff.
[01:23:16.321 --> 01:23:16.722]  It was drugs.
[01:23:23.618 --> 01:23:26.221]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[01:23:26.241 --> 01:23:27.562]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:23:27.582 --> 01:23:29.384]  You will be attacked for coming on, and we know you know that.
[01:23:29.424 --> 01:23:29.704]  Thank you.
[01:23:31.305 --> 01:23:32.607]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:32.667 --> 01:23:35.089]  So, let's get a little bit in before we get to the really big news.
[01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:38.812]  Let's get into their list of demands that I've got here in my stack.
[01:23:39.273 --> 01:23:41.675]  I mean, you talk about communists, and we'll put that on screen.
[01:23:41.735 --> 01:23:46.460]  It's linked on grudgereport.com, our article, going over their list of demands.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.642]  Let's go ahead and talk about those, Matt Bracken.
[01:23:50.979 --> 01:23:57.446]  Yeah, we're seeing already what happens when a state is demographically invaded.
[01:23:58.007 --> 01:23:59.689]  California is the test case.
[01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:03.173]  It's already past the point of no return, I would consider.
[01:24:04.054 --> 01:24:09.600]  When you get enough foreign invaders into the country and they gain enough political influence,
[01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:14.837]  They basically then will open the door for all of the other invaders following behind them.
[01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:16.538]  And that's California today.
[01:24:17.359 --> 01:24:20.621]  This invasion march, the 1,200, supposedly 1,200, it might be more.
[01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:24.425]  They're not going to go into Arizona.
[01:24:24.445 --> 01:24:25.787]  It looks like they're going to hook a left.
[01:24:25.847 --> 01:24:26.587]  They're not walking.
[01:24:26.607 --> 01:24:28.550]  They're on buses and things like that.
[01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:36.859]  They're going to head for a California border where Jerry Brown might, who knows, he might put obstacles in the way of the federal government.
[01:24:37.319 --> 01:24:42.385]  It might be a kind of like almost a pre-Civil War Fort Sumter moment if you have
[01:24:43.926 --> 01:24:52.534]  California State Police ordered to hinder the movement of federal forces up to the border in order to allow this asylum march to march into Cali.
[01:24:54.536 --> 01:25:03.645]  I wrote this book in 2006, and like a lot of my books, people at the time think it's a lot of hyperbole.
[01:25:04.494 --> 01:25:07.577]  You know, this is what we're seeing right now, and it's not going to get better.
[01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:32.187]  What they say, here it says, open the borders to us because we are as much citizens as the people of countries where we are and our travel.
[01:25:32.207 --> 01:25:33.969]  That's just classic UN world government stuff.
[01:25:34.410 --> 01:25:43.139]  We demand of Mexico and the United States that they respect our rights as refugees and our right to dignified work and to be able to support our families, the statement reads.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:49.527]  The second demand is that we open the borders to us because we are as much citizens as you are.
[01:25:49.868 --> 01:25:54.493]  Frankly, immigration wouldn't be a hotbed political issue, America, and would be the second.
[01:25:55.674 --> 01:25:56.515]  That statement was true.
[01:25:57.035 --> 01:25:59.478]  And then it goes into more of what they're demanding.
[01:25:59.558 --> 01:26:11.729]  Our mission is to provide shelter and safety to migrants and refugees in transit, accompanying them in their journey and together demand respect for our human rights, says the group's Facebook page.
[01:26:11.749 --> 01:26:13.330]  But I can't come to your country and get anything free.
[01:26:13.871 --> 01:26:19.436]  Our dream is to build solidarity bridges among peoples and turn down border walls imposed by greed.
[01:26:19.856 --> 01:26:21.017]  But not in China or North Korea.
[01:26:21.934 --> 01:26:27.197]  I think that this can work to Trump's great benefit depending on how he handles it because it's such an overreach.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:48.602]  Just like the Supreme Court justice coming out against the Second Amendment.
[01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:49.682]  I think it's overreach.
[01:26:49.702 --> 01:26:51.083]  People get overconfident.
[01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:52.363]  They show their hands.
[01:26:52.403 --> 01:26:53.704]  They tip their hands too soon.
[01:26:54.364 --> 01:26:59.706]  And this is a chance, I think, for Trump to put some serious force at the border and then never remove it.
[01:27:00.666 --> 01:27:05.368]  He could start with the 10 miles either side of where this march plans to cross.
[01:27:06.215 --> 01:27:09.657]  Put up the barrier and just leave it and extend it from there.
[01:27:10.238 --> 01:27:14.581]  What the Border Patrol needs is a physical barrier, whether it's a wall or a multiple fence system.
[01:27:15.217 --> 01:27:29.782]  What the Democrats and the RINOs have done over the last 20 years is keep the border wide open, which forces the Border Patrol to defend in depth, going back, you know, 20, 30, 40 miles, running around open desert, playing Keystone Cops.
[01:27:30.462 --> 01:27:38.645]  If you have an actual physical barrier, which 90% of the border has virtually a meaningless barrier, something you can step over, then
[01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:44.492]  If there is a barrier, there's something for the Border Patrol to stand behind and watch.
[01:27:44.913 --> 01:27:49.276]  When there's no barrier, they have to guard 20 miles into the hinterland.
[01:27:49.336 --> 01:27:51.418]  It's a fool's errand, it's made that way.
[01:27:51.718 --> 01:28:00.005]  That's why the people that want open borders always talk about technology, because they can put on a demonstration, it looks good, then they can turn that off.
[01:28:01.035 --> 01:28:03.276]  A physical barrier they can't switch off.
[01:28:03.476 --> 01:28:04.956]  And that's why they won't allow it.
[01:28:05.276 --> 01:28:05.896]  It would work.
[01:28:06.056 --> 01:28:07.117]  That's why they don't want it.
[01:28:07.137 --> 01:28:14.379]  But wouldn't an anti-truck ditch in front of barbed wire and then a road and then more barbed wire behind that?
[01:28:14.399 --> 01:28:15.839]  I mean, that's what we really need, right?
[01:28:15.919 --> 01:28:18.240]  Is to have a ditch dug in front of it.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:20.160]  But you don't even need a ditch.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:22.441]  And it depends on the terrain, whether it's rock or what.
[01:28:22.481 --> 01:28:23.881]  But you don't even need a ditch.
[01:28:23.941 --> 01:28:26.242]  And anything like that is going to take way more time.
[01:28:27.006 --> 01:28:31.729]  They can pull a wire fence off the back of a truck miles per day.
[01:28:32.369 --> 01:28:33.170]  Miles per day.
[01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:34.370]  And then just improve it.
[01:28:35.231 --> 01:28:39.734]  Once there's a physical barrier, multiple fence system even, which can be done in weeks.
[01:28:40.134 --> 01:28:40.814]  Hungary did it!
[01:28:40.834 --> 01:28:42.395]  I mean, Hungary!
[01:28:42.615 --> 01:28:43.596]  We're the United States!
[01:28:45.174 --> 01:28:47.196]  And Hungary had to because it was under a U.N.
[01:28:47.216 --> 01:28:54.901]  invasion, all orchestrated by the U.N., by Soros, by all of them, and the German government saying, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby!
[01:28:55.282 --> 01:28:57.663]  We'll be right back with Matt Bracken and the big news.
[01:28:57.743 --> 01:29:00.345]  Then, the Ted Nugent exclusive interview premiered.
[01:29:00.385 --> 01:29:00.826]  Stay with us.
[01:29:02.290 --> 01:29:06.776]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[01:29:06.916 --> 01:29:14.326]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[01:29:14.587 --> 01:29:18.532]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[01:29:18.792 --> 01:29:24.776]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[01:29:24.937 --> 01:29:31.321]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:41.669]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:48.332]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:29:48.713 --> 01:29:51.314]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver and Iodine.
[01:29:51.574 --> 01:29:54.896]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[01:29:55.196 --> 01:30:00.099]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:00.179 --> 01:30:02.080]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:13.649 --> 01:30:22.736]  We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him, and the free system that allowed it to happen in American history.
[01:30:23.216 --> 01:30:32.103]  From the highest levels of government to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us.
[01:30:32.663 --> 01:30:37.584]  But the ultimate insult is that they think we're so stupid that we'll let them get away with it.
[01:30:38.064 --> 01:30:54.409]  These saboteurs, slashing away with their leaks and sneers, their phony accusations and gagging sanctimony, drive their daggers through the heart of our future, poisoning our belief that honest custody of our institutions will ever again be possible.
[01:30:55.009 --> 01:30:59.030]  So they can then build their utopia from the ashes of what they burned down.
[01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.950]  No.
[01:31:00.511 --> 01:31:06.136]  Their fate will be failure, and they will perish in the political flames of their own fires.
[01:31:07.077 --> 01:31:13.184]  We are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedom's safest place.
[01:31:13.244 --> 01:31:15.906]  You know, I just heard that National Rifle Association ad.
[01:31:17.087 --> 01:31:20.928]  Airing on the radio side, TV side.
[01:31:20.948 --> 01:31:23.929]  We had a video ad going with Dana Lash.
[01:31:23.949 --> 01:31:25.130]  I always call her Losh.
[01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:26.890]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:27.650]  Dana Lash.
[01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:29.591]  Great, smart, syndicated radio host.
[01:31:30.491 --> 01:31:30.951]  Great lady.
[01:31:31.492 --> 01:31:33.232]  Very successful spokesperson for the NRA.
[01:31:33.252 --> 01:31:37.994]  But the left wants to basically kill and says she's a witch and burn her, literally.
[01:31:39.614 --> 01:31:43.595]  They heard that ad running and Media Matters wrote stories about it.
[01:31:44.316 --> 01:31:45.436]  George Soros' outfit.
[01:31:46.556 --> 01:31:56.660]  Saying, oh look, the National Rifle Association's spending money with Alex Jones, like they're the arbiter, they're the boss, they're the god, and ooh, if they say it's bad, it's bad.
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.301]  No, morons.
[01:31:59.041 --> 01:32:00.041]  I like that ad.
[01:32:01.102 --> 01:32:05.143]  So, I have part of the radio ads on the network, so I run that ad.
[01:32:05.464 --> 01:32:07.784]  Even though one of those ads is about $1,000 a minute, I run it.
[01:32:07.845 --> 01:32:09.025]  And eat $1,000 every time.
[01:32:09.885 --> 01:32:10.746]  Comprende?
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.681]  I pay to air the NRA.
[01:32:17.781 --> 01:32:18.381]  Figure that out?
[01:32:19.222 --> 01:32:20.682]  So you guys don't get it, do you?
[01:32:21.443 --> 01:32:22.783]  I'm not doing this for money.
[01:32:23.443 --> 01:32:24.964]  I'm not doing this for myself.
[01:32:25.644 --> 01:32:28.966]  I don't sit there and calculate the work I do about me personally.
[01:32:29.326 --> 01:32:31.306]  It's about my children and the future.
[01:32:31.967 --> 01:32:32.907]  I'm a kamikaze.
[01:32:33.867 --> 01:32:35.728]  I don't care what you do to me financially.
[01:32:36.028 --> 01:32:37.349]  I don't care how you come after me.
[01:32:37.529 --> 01:32:38.429]  I'm committed.
[01:32:38.969 --> 01:32:42.831]  Because I know you're bad people and I want to get you off of our collective backs.
[01:32:45.655 --> 01:32:48.978]  Isn't that something you can now understand, dumbos?
[01:32:52.802 --> 01:32:58.748]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:06.275 --> 01:33:08.898]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:33.431 --> 01:33:35.132]  I just talked to my lawyer during the break.
[01:33:35.472 --> 01:33:36.913]  They have added other experts.
[01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:38.374]  Look at this very closely.
[01:33:38.394 --> 01:33:44.558]  This latest lawsuit against us, we filed the correction under the state statute.
[01:33:44.958 --> 01:33:47.779]  So there's no expansive damages.
[01:33:51.181 --> 01:33:52.562]  And normally they get thrown out of court.
[01:33:53.242 --> 01:33:55.444]  And we did not say the person's name in the photo.
[01:33:56.084 --> 01:33:59.466]  And we removed it within a day of it being up when other sites didn't.
[01:33:59.946 --> 01:34:00.767]  What am I talking about?
[01:34:02.523 --> 01:34:06.144]  Falsely accused Parkland shooter sues Alex Jones Infowars for defamation.
[01:34:07.384 --> 01:34:11.885]  The day of the shooting when nobody had Nick Cruz's photo, it was all over TV, all over the press.
[01:34:12.345 --> 01:34:16.026]  This is a potential person because on the Facebook, didn't have the man's name.
[01:34:17.566 --> 01:34:21.767]  We took it down within a day and we retracted it.
[01:34:22.788 --> 01:34:24.808]  But they said under state law we didn't retract.
[01:34:25.608 --> 01:34:28.689]  Funny, we got the registered letter, we got the retraction, we got the date, we got it all.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:37.823]  And then they have lawyers that are highly respected, telling the Daily Beast, this might make for good press, but it's dangerous.
[01:34:38.603 --> 01:34:41.324]  White continued, Texas is very strong anti-slap law.
[01:34:41.424 --> 01:34:53.049]  Infowars can frame the lawsuit as being broadly about the content of a speech in general, or about the speech of third-party commentators, for whom Infowars are not responsible under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
[01:34:53.369 --> 01:34:56.810]  The plaintiff faces a real risk of anti-slap ruling.
[01:34:58.353 --> 01:34:59.714]  And that's one of the top lawyers out there.
[01:34:59.734 --> 01:35:01.615]  My lawyer is one of the top lawyers in that area as well.
[01:35:02.095 --> 01:35:06.737]  And he'll be, his name's known, but he'll be emerging in a press conference very soon next week.
[01:35:06.757 --> 01:35:12.520]  I'm going to leave it at that because he's riding up the press release right now for some reasons that I can't announce at this point.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:17.563]  But the suit also said that, again, that we had never retracted.
[01:35:17.603 --> 01:35:18.023]  We did.
[01:35:19.023 --> 01:35:26.047]  And, of course, that is Ken White, First Amendment litigator at Brown, White & Osborne, said the suit could run afoul of Texas law.
[01:35:27.694 --> 01:35:33.299]  And went on to say, boy, are they telling these plaintiffs that they're the ones that are going to get sued?
[01:35:33.679 --> 01:35:35.320]  I mean, that's what I'm telling you, folks.
[01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:37.282]  I'm not just putting a good face on this.
[01:35:38.103 --> 01:35:41.906]  Every one of these lawsuits, my lawyers have never seen anything like it.
[01:35:44.108 --> 01:35:49.792]  And other law firms, I've reached out now to like seven different law firms just to get different opinions on all these lawsuits.
[01:35:49.812 --> 01:35:52.535]  And they go, yes, we've never seen anything like these.
[01:35:53.851 --> 01:35:54.911]  We're going to have bragging for the rest of the hour.
[01:35:54.931 --> 01:35:56.172]  We'll have plenty of time to get into this big story.
[01:35:56.192 --> 01:36:00.812]  But I just want people to understand the attack on the 1st of November that's happening right now is insane.
[01:36:01.433 --> 01:36:21.277]  Because there'll be a 50-page filing, a 70-page filing, an 80-page filing, a 20-page filing, and they'll just say, Alex is a white supremacist, and Alex hates everybody, and he says no one died at Parkland, and he said that this guy who was a photographer killed the girl and set it all up.
[01:36:22.256 --> 01:36:23.697]  And then none of us ever said that.
[01:36:23.717 --> 01:36:24.678]  They don't give exhibits.
[01:36:25.018 --> 01:36:27.981]  It's the most insane defamation ever.
[01:36:28.701 --> 01:36:34.206]  But they think in court, generally this is the case, that defamatory statements are protected.
[01:36:34.926 --> 01:36:39.690]  So what the media is doing is they're defaming me with these lawsuits every week.
[01:36:41.572 --> 01:36:49.018]  It'll get slapped down on summary judgment, but they don't care because I gotta get lawyers, I gotta look at it, I gotta show up in court, I gotta do it, and it costs money.
[01:36:51.698 --> 01:36:58.102]  But even liberal lawyers are going... I wouldn't show this to some of the top liberal lawyers in Austin.
[01:36:58.122 --> 01:36:59.103]  They're some of the top in the state.
[01:36:59.483 --> 01:37:04.867]  And they said, yeah, this is really dangerous, and we're surprised the ACLU isn't on your side.
[01:37:04.887 --> 01:37:07.949]  We're like, well, we're talking to them, and they actually are going to be in some amicus briefs and things.
[01:37:07.969 --> 01:37:08.629]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:09.610]  That's going to be announced soon.
[01:37:10.210 --> 01:37:13.353]  But they are on our side.
[01:37:14.433 --> 01:37:19.837]  Because A, we never said this stuff, and B, these lawsuits filed by Georgetown ends the First Amendment.
[01:37:23.018 --> 01:37:28.141]  And I love how the Daily Beast says, it's unclear how InfoWars will defend itself, and they did not immediately respond.
[01:37:28.501 --> 01:37:35.626]  What these, all these people, five minutes before they publish, an email comes in, sometimes as it publishes, and says, do you want to comment to our article?
[01:37:35.906 --> 01:37:39.168]  Because under, again, under lawsuit code, they have to get a comment.
[01:37:39.528 --> 01:37:42.450]  But they're not getting comments for any of these.
[01:37:43.051 --> 01:37:46.113]  Because if they'd have got my comment, I'd have said, we already retracted that.
[01:37:47.053 --> 01:37:49.175]  And we already removed it under state statute.
[01:37:49.835 --> 01:37:51.196]  Basically blocking a lawsuit.
[01:37:52.608 --> 01:37:54.009]  You can still file it, but it goes nowhere.
[01:37:54.029 --> 01:37:54.749]  There's no damages.
[01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:58.012]  They never get our quote, because they don't want the quote.
[01:37:58.992 --> 01:38:00.873]  They want to just run ahead with the BS.
[01:38:02.114 --> 01:38:04.056]  So, InfoWars is winning.
[01:38:04.196 --> 01:38:05.436]  InfoWars is expanding.
[01:38:05.737 --> 01:38:06.877]  CNN is collapsing.
[01:38:07.258 --> 01:38:08.398]  MSNBC is collapsing.
[01:38:08.679 --> 01:38:10.320]  Globalism is falling apart all over the world.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:14.622]  This is all to make it look like we're losing, so the left thinks they're winning.
[01:38:16.684 --> 01:38:17.985]  But they see us as the number one enemy.
[01:38:18.005 --> 01:38:19.005]  I'm asking Matt Bracken why.
[01:38:19.025 --> 01:38:20.086]  Then we're getting into his big story.
[01:38:20.106 --> 01:38:21.347]  He'll have the floor for the balance of the hour.
[01:38:23.271 --> 01:38:34.975]  That's why earlier I got into mainstream news, Associated Press, Daily Mail today about the amazing benefits of turmeric for inflammation in the body and so many other areas.
[01:38:35.316 --> 01:38:39.157]  We have the strongest curcumin rated of any company tested out there.
[01:38:39.917 --> 01:38:46.720]  According to the big companies we went and had this produced by, and we have the test, all of it, a 95 curcuminoid rating.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:47.900]  95% of the active chemical in
[01:38:54.693 --> 01:38:56.134]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:38:58.056 --> 01:38:59.877]  95% of what's in the turmeric is the active ingredient.
[01:39:00.237 --> 01:39:04.641]  This is supercharged, concentrated, in an organic process that's patented.
[01:39:06.342 --> 01:39:10.205]  Anti-inflammatory support, flexibility support, joint support, you name it.
[01:39:11.446 --> 01:39:13.427]  And it's 25% off.
[01:39:13.467 --> 01:39:14.168]  It's been sold out.
[01:39:14.528 --> 01:39:15.189]  It's back in stock.
[01:39:17.506 --> 01:39:18.967]  It's all there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:39:19.047 --> 01:39:23.409]  We're ending the special on Brain Force and the special on the Real Red Pill that go together today.
[01:39:23.429 --> 01:39:25.130]  50% off and free shipping.
[01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:26.651]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:39:27.391 --> 01:39:30.253]  But we need to sell a lot of product at these type of sales, okay?
[01:39:30.793 --> 01:39:33.515]  So please, see how great Brain Force is or stock up on it.
[01:39:33.875 --> 01:39:38.698]  And we have a new product that's gonna roll out today, but I've been so busy I haven't gotten to it yet.
[01:39:38.858 --> 01:39:39.878]  It's amazing as well.
[01:39:40.379 --> 01:39:43.981]  I'll tell you about that a little bit later in the next hour before we premiere this Ted Nugent interview.
[01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:45.862]  I have another guest joining us as well.
[01:39:46.623 --> 01:39:48.027]  Dr. Jerome Corsi's popping in.
[01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:52.179]  But I probably want to keep bragging a little bit longer, so let's push Corsi back 10-15 minutes if we can.
[01:39:53.556 --> 01:39:55.016]  I'm going to open the phones up as well.
[01:39:56.117 --> 01:40:01.858]  But we've come out with the big containers of the Super Blue Silver Solution with Iodine.
[01:40:02.638 --> 01:40:09.759]  It's called, technically, because my dad's a dentist and all that, Immune Gargle, but you can swallow this as well at the dosages that are there.
[01:40:10.119 --> 01:40:13.060]  And it's got an amazing patented type of special colloidal silver.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:17.081]  And it's got the iodine and so much more.
[01:40:17.461 --> 01:40:18.661]  We're really, really proud of this.
[01:40:19.617 --> 01:40:22.598]  This will end up being, again, extremely popular.
[01:40:22.658 --> 01:40:31.582]  Nanosilver, peppermint essential oil, and of course, iodine, and of course, the colloidal silver.
[01:40:32.282 --> 01:40:35.963]  So, ladies and gentlemen, the silver, the nanosilver.
[01:40:36.364 --> 01:40:37.444]  So, this is amazing.
[01:40:37.864 --> 01:40:41.806]  And this is for, I mean, I use this now to gargle every day.
[01:40:42.986 --> 01:40:44.287]  And it's amazing.
[01:40:44.608 --> 01:40:47.490]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:52.614]  We're going to go to break and come back for three segments.
[01:40:52.674 --> 01:41:04.923]  I'm going to give Matt Bracken the absolute floor to give you a presentation here on what he believes is the most enormous danger to the Republic and our freedom right now, and
[01:41:07.363 --> 01:41:09.707]  That we are in the most extreme peril we've ever been in.
[01:41:09.808 --> 01:41:10.830]  And I totally agree.
[01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:12.252]  The enemy's going for broke.
[01:41:12.312 --> 01:41:13.134]  So get ready.
[01:41:13.555 --> 01:41:15.578]  On the other side, Trump just announced troops on the border.
[01:41:17.023 --> 01:41:18.324]  I haven't gotten out details yet.
[01:41:18.344 --> 01:41:18.724]  That's good.
[01:41:18.744 --> 01:41:22.107]  I don't want them to know exactly what's going to happen, but I would call out the State Guard.
[01:41:22.647 --> 01:41:28.632]  I would pull the troops out of Syria, which he says he's doing, and send them there, because you've got these terror bands coming.
[01:41:28.732 --> 01:41:29.533]  And he's absolutely right.
[01:41:29.553 --> 01:41:38.439]  They're going to try to go to California, where they have a big political uprising against the military and against the federal government.
[01:41:38.499 --> 01:41:40.321]  And I think that's where the troops should be deployed.
[01:41:41.282 --> 01:41:42.462]  California is ignoring
[01:41:43.803 --> 01:41:47.386]  Federal law, it's telling MS-13 gang members when ICE is coming.
[01:41:47.846 --> 01:41:49.567]  They're in open rebellion saying resist.
[01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:52.069]  That is federal government's jurisdiction.
[01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:56.092]  If the feds want to just set up random checkpoints on a highway, I say arrest them.
[01:41:57.193 --> 01:42:04.097]  Unless they've got an active shooter or a guy with a bomb or something that's coming down the road, then that's an emergency.
[01:42:04.818 --> 01:42:06.459]  And you've got probable cause.
[01:42:06.499 --> 01:42:08.581]  You've got suspicion.
[01:42:09.661 --> 01:42:11.343]  But the feds can do whatever they want on the border.
[01:42:11.943 --> 01:42:12.804]  Whatever they want on the border.
[01:42:13.530 --> 01:42:14.330]  To non-citizens.
[01:42:15.771 --> 01:42:16.832]  And that's a fact.
[01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:22.294]  And we are so nice to immigrants in this country, and we're being attacked by a foreign globalist force.
[01:42:22.594 --> 01:42:23.515]  This is happening.
[01:42:23.555 --> 01:42:24.635]  This isn't rhetoric.
[01:42:24.996 --> 01:42:27.617]  And our First Amendment's under attack, and our Second Amendment, so again.
[01:42:29.204 --> 01:42:34.107]  I know that about one and a half percent of our audience goes and buys products, and you're the folks pulling the whole wagon.
[01:42:34.407 --> 01:42:36.408]  And I love everybody else out there that spreads the links, you name it.
[01:42:36.789 --> 01:42:38.470]  But folks, go look at the five-star reviews.
[01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:41.692]  We have the best supplements, things that really are great and will change your life.
[01:42:42.392 --> 01:42:51.678]  We have great water filters, great air filters, great emergency radios, great tactical gear, the best, latest, lowest-priced body armor, thousands of items in FullWorthStore.com.
[01:42:51.978 --> 01:42:56.641]  And if you'll just support us and our local affiliates, supporting their sponsors, we're unstoppable.
[01:42:57.542 --> 01:42:58.487]  Lastly, we need your prayers.
[01:42:58.507 --> 01:43:00.436]  We'll be back with Matt Bracken's emergency report.
[01:43:04.571 --> 01:43:22.884]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I've had to speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:43:22.964 --> 01:43:28.568]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:43:29.249 --> 01:43:29.929]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:33.192]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:43:33.852 --> 01:43:34.833]  And so much more.
[01:43:35.393 --> 01:43:36.514]  It is concentrated.
[01:43:36.734 --> 01:43:38.455]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:43:38.475 --> 01:43:44.159]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:43:44.279 --> 01:43:45.480]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.442]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:43:47.502 --> 01:43:49.903]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:43:50.104 --> 01:43:51.364]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:43:51.545 --> 01:43:53.346]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:43:53.906 --> 01:43:54.507]  Immune Wall.
[01:43:54.607 --> 01:43:55.948]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:56.048 --> 01:43:57.229]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:44:02.748 --> 01:44:06.170]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:13.234]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:44:13.534 --> 01:44:18.277]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[01:44:18.297 --> 01:44:18.797]  It's very simple.
[01:44:19.037 --> 01:44:21.179]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[01:44:21.539 --> 01:44:23.380]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.261]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[01:44:25.321 --> 01:44:26.342]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:44:26.462 --> 01:44:27.202]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:44:32.145 --> 01:44:35.027]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[01:44:35.187 --> 01:44:39.310]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:43.433]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[01:44:43.473 --> 01:44:46.895]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:44:47.335 --> 01:44:50.257]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:53.900]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:56.441]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[01:44:56.741 --> 01:44:57.442]  It's amazing.
[01:44:57.762 --> 01:45:00.284]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:02.726 --> 01:45:04.107]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:45:04.387 --> 01:45:05.689]  You can't survive without it.
[01:45:05.869 --> 01:45:06.770]  But where do you get it?
[01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:12.836]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:45:13.056 --> 01:45:18.782]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:45:18.962 --> 01:45:35.844]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:45:36.224 --> 01:45:38.345]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:45:38.705 --> 01:45:39.906]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:45:40.186 --> 01:45:40.947]  Easy assembly.

[01:45:42.127 --> 01:45:43.948]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:45:58.696 --> 01:46:00.537]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:09.342]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:46:09.743 --> 01:46:12.685]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:46:13.085 --> 01:46:15.066]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:46:15.627 --> 01:46:20.030]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:46:20.370 --> 01:46:22.431]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:46:22.711 --> 01:46:29.096]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:46:29.716 --> 01:46:36.938]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:46:37.919 --> 01:46:42.560]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:49.943]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:46:50.603 --> 01:46:55.067]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[01:47:00.691 --> 01:47:09.138]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.522 --> 01:47:19.586]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:21.966 --> 01:47:23.566]  Our country is under globalist attack.
[01:47:23.847 --> 01:47:27.107]  Our institutions are infiltrated with globalist collaborators.
[01:47:27.507 --> 01:47:31.809]  They are trying to shut down the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment.
[01:47:32.909 --> 01:47:39.511]  The governor and many of the mayors of California are in open sedition and revolt against our Republican form of government.
[01:47:39.911 --> 01:47:43.932]  And I see so many leftists even on TV going, why is it a Republican form?
[01:47:43.952 --> 01:47:45.072]  We're a Democrat too.
[01:47:45.572 --> 01:47:48.033]  Republican means we're a Republic.
[01:47:48.493 --> 01:47:49.995]  And that we have the people in charge.
[01:47:50.115 --> 01:47:51.697]  And that we have a separation of powers.
[01:47:51.977 --> 01:47:54.600]  And that there's a federalist system and there is a state system.
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:55.681]  And they're balanced.
[01:47:56.061 --> 01:47:58.243]  And the federal government has control of the borders.
[01:47:58.624 --> 01:48:05.831]  And when the states and the cities particularly say, we're going to block federal agents with warrants, arresting criminals, that is sedition.
[01:48:05.891 --> 01:48:07.433]  That is go to jail.
[01:48:07.653 --> 01:48:07.894]  Boom.
[01:48:09.887 --> 01:48:14.255]  It's just crazy we've gotten to this point, but this is the globalists and their model.
[01:48:14.275 --> 01:48:15.356]  The same thing is being done in Europe.
[01:48:15.757 --> 01:48:19.203]  So Matt Bracken believes, and I agree with him, he's got a detailed report right here in front of me.
[01:48:20.334 --> 01:48:26.118]  That they're planning something really, really big with a false flag involving David Hogg, who we pray for.
[01:48:26.158 --> 01:48:28.920]  We don't want anything to happen to him, just like Obama that turned him into a martyr.
[01:48:29.401 --> 01:48:30.701]  And I totally agree with his analysis.
[01:48:30.722 --> 01:48:34.384]  He has predicted the other globalist events and other triggered events.
[01:48:34.744 --> 01:48:37.766]  So, Matt Bracken, in this segment and the next and the next, you've got the floor.
[01:48:38.087 --> 01:48:40.048]  I'll bring you in and out of breaks, but you've got the floor.
[01:48:40.448 --> 01:48:42.770]  Break this down, this emergency alert.
[01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:46.873]  Maximum danger, as you say in your report to me that you wanted to cover.
[01:48:47.393 --> 01:48:54.614]  I totally agree and that we are now, you don't like to be hysterical, you're not, but you're saying this is either a false flag or a guided flag.
[01:48:54.954 --> 01:48:55.915]  Explain what that means.
[01:48:57.435 --> 01:49:07.117]  Well, I wouldn't say, you know, categorically I wouldn't state there is an FBI agent out there who's going to do a false flag assault rifle massacre.
[01:49:07.897 --> 01:49:13.898]  But when time after time after time the FBI keeps so-called dropping the ball
[01:49:14.693 --> 01:49:23.958]  You know, you have to wonder, when they know that these lunatics are triggered and prepared and ready to go into action, somehow they don't take the call.
[01:49:24.599 --> 01:49:28.001]  You know, somehow the local law enforcement in Broward, same thing.
[01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:35.525]  They had some very kind of mysterious drills, shooter drills, at that school that they'd never had before.
[01:49:36.146 --> 01:49:38.967]  The next thing you know, they're having this massacre.
[01:49:40.507 --> 01:49:43.030]  No, so I'm not saying that there was a federal agent pulling the trigger.
[01:49:43.050 --> 01:49:54.421]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:50:02.489 --> 01:50:03.289]  And he had a camera.
[01:50:03.309 --> 01:50:04.449]  He was prepared to film it.
[01:50:04.989 --> 01:50:12.751]  And the working supposition that I have is that he was trying to become a known, famous American jihadi.
[01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:15.131]  And this video would be his cred.
[01:50:16.151 --> 01:50:22.133]  That he was going to allow a massacre to happen in Texas, which would have killed the Dutch leader.
[01:50:23.533 --> 01:50:25.673]  He had actually left, but the terrorists didn't know that.
[01:50:26.113 --> 01:50:28.514]  But also Pam Geller and
[01:50:30.434 --> 01:50:34.337]  Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch and other people.
[01:50:34.457 --> 01:50:35.978]  They were going to let this happen.
[01:50:36.318 --> 01:50:37.659]  You have to understand something.
[01:50:38.459 --> 01:50:53.048]  Even though federal agents and others take an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic, what they've really been taught in college and then moving into the FBI with their entrance exam is social justice.
[01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:55.750]  The Constitution to them is a joke.
[01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:59.653]  It's something that they have to work around until they can just get rid of it.
[01:51:00.153 --> 01:51:05.076]  But when you hear the ends justify the means, this is a communist tenet.
[01:51:05.911 --> 01:51:08.713]  They use another phrase now that means the same thing.
[01:51:08.973 --> 01:51:10.594]  By any means necessary.
[01:51:11.114 --> 01:51:18.678]  You have the goal of a socialist utopia, which you have to force on people because we're too stupid to realize it's for our own good.
[01:51:19.119 --> 01:51:26.643]  So they have to force this socialist utopia on us, but they can't do it until they get rid of the first two amendments, which they're working on very hard.
[01:51:27.316 --> 01:51:42.591]  So these social justice warrior FBI agents, like the despicable creep that followed the terrorists to Garland to film a massacre of Americans and foreign guests, intentionally letting this happen, that was the plan, no question about it.
[01:51:43.632 --> 01:51:48.617]  I think that if they knew that there was a psycho getting ready to fire into a concert or a stadium,
[01:51:49.477 --> 01:51:53.840]  They might just let the phone drop and not take the call.
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:55.721]  Just pretend they never heard about it.
[01:51:55.761 --> 01:51:57.241]  Well, we know what happened in Broward County.
[01:51:57.281 --> 01:51:58.902]  We know what happened in San Bernardino.
[01:52:00.599 --> 01:52:05.403]  Operation Fast and Furious itself was a massive false flag operation.
[01:52:05.863 --> 01:52:21.035]  For months before Agent Brian Terry was killed, for months, Holder, Hillary Clinton, and others were going on the talk shows saying that 90% of the weapons in Mexico that are found at murder scenes came from American gun shops.
[01:52:21.115 --> 01:52:21.836]  It's our fault.
[01:52:22.216 --> 01:52:24.458]  This was the false narrative that they were spinning.
[01:52:24.898 --> 01:52:26.540]  At the same time, they were pumping
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:30.665]  You know, send the automatic AKs and AR-15s into Mexico.
[01:52:31.446 --> 01:52:32.667]  No plan to track them.
[01:52:33.068 --> 01:52:35.911]  Did not inform the Mexican government, which is an act of war.
[01:52:36.392 --> 01:52:43.941]  There was no law enforcement project behind this other than get Mexicans murdered with American weapons.
[01:52:44.281 --> 01:52:47.382]  So anybody that says, oh Matt Bracken, you're a hysteric.
[01:52:47.762 --> 01:52:50.243]  Our wonderful FBI would never do anything like that.
[01:52:50.644 --> 01:52:54.045]  It wasn't just the ATF involved in Operation Fast and Furious.
[01:52:54.485 --> 01:52:57.886]  It was ATF and FBI from California to Texas.
[01:52:57.946 --> 01:53:04.209]  And let's remember, Cheryl Atkinson of CBS News, just to back you up, she got the documents that the ATF agents were saying, why are we doing this?
[01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:06.190]  They said, because we're going to blame the Second Amendment.
[01:53:06.210 --> 01:53:06.830]  Now shut up!
[01:53:07.887 --> 01:53:08.127]  Right.
[01:53:08.408 --> 01:53:16.475]  So these social justice warrior FBI agents, they've been taking their oath with their fingers crossed behind their back to defend the Constitution.
[01:53:16.955 --> 01:53:27.425]  They consider the Constitution an archaic white man slavery relic, and they've got to force us into their socialist utopia for our own good.
[01:53:27.665 --> 01:53:28.746]  Well, we're on to them.
[01:53:29.147 --> 01:53:31.469]  That's why I wrote this book 15 years ago.
[01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:36.575]  I put it on a Kindle free run today since I know I'd be on today.
[01:53:36.635 --> 01:53:39.219]  I can only do that like the day before for the next day.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:41.642]  So when I get called on short notice, I can't do it.
[01:53:41.702 --> 01:53:43.585]  But today, this book's free on Kindle.
[01:53:44.146 --> 01:53:47.250]  And I hope as many people as possible viewing this can download it.
[01:53:49.974 --> 01:53:50.895]  Free on Kindle.
[01:53:51.215 --> 01:53:56.559]  That one starts in a stadium on opening day with a massacre, an assault rifle massacre.
[01:53:57.019 --> 01:54:05.406]  The patsy who was killed is a veteran, you know, who had sent threatening letters to the VA and had sent a lot of crank threatening letters.
[01:54:05.766 --> 01:54:06.907]  So he's a perfect patsy.
[01:54:06.927 --> 01:54:14.112]  He's taken out of a VA hospital, killed at the scene, and it's all to, you know, to basically destroy the Second Amendment.
[01:54:14.132 --> 01:54:16.174]  Well, let's cut to the chase and then you'll walk over the facts.
[01:54:16.194 --> 01:54:18.516]  I've read your analysis you sent me wanting to come on about this.
[01:54:19.754 --> 01:54:20.295]  Spot on.
[01:54:20.335 --> 01:54:36.847]  They are setting up the atmosphere to wind somebody up, let it happen, or actually do it, and that the David Hogg thing and all this is just a primer to then, when the big attack comes, and we know Vegas they stood down for as well, that they're really going to push to have civil unrest, remove Trump.
[01:54:37.127 --> 01:54:40.730]  So kind of define what you think is coming, then walk through the facts for us.
[01:54:41.391 --> 01:54:45.554]  Well, at the macro globalist level, taking it above American politics,
[01:54:46.582 --> 01:54:50.706]  It doesn't really matter to them whether we have a Second Amendment or not.
[01:54:51.466 --> 01:54:55.650]  What they would like to see is America torn apart in a bloody civil war.
[01:54:56.391 --> 01:55:02.836]  If America is involved in a civil war, we won't be dealing with Korea, we won't be dealing with Russia or China.
[01:55:03.176 --> 01:55:09.382]  We will be tearing ourselves up right here inside of these 48 states in the continental United States.
[01:55:09.782 --> 01:55:13.005]  That removes America from the world stage as a superpower.
[01:55:13.585 --> 01:55:17.887]  At the end of that civil war, there may or may not be an American Republic.
[01:55:17.927 --> 01:55:20.048]  There may be regions or factions.
[01:55:20.549 --> 01:55:23.230]  We may devolve into an anarchical state.
[01:55:23.670 --> 01:55:36.757]  So, for the people that consider America, the American Republic, to be the greatest obstacle to their globalist, socialist, utopian vision, socialists plus Islamists,
[01:55:37.904 --> 01:55:41.550]  Just having America blow itself up would be perfect.
[01:55:41.951 --> 01:55:46.378]  So it's not like, oh, Matt, well, why would they want to see the First Amendment gone or the second?
[01:55:46.678 --> 01:55:47.380]  Forget about that.
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.722]  Go rise above that.
[01:55:49.412 --> 01:55:54.956]  Just to have America detonate a hand grenade and drop a hand grenade at its feet would be perfect.
[01:55:55.376 --> 01:56:00.861]  So right now we've got an attack that's happening on multiple phases, multiple lines of attack.
[01:56:00.941 --> 01:56:02.922]  And you can see what's building in the next phase.
[01:56:03.062 --> 01:56:03.723]  And you're dead on.
[01:56:03.783 --> 01:56:06.044]  They've already launched their civil war.
[01:56:06.064 --> 01:56:07.085]  They call it a civil war.
[01:56:07.125 --> 01:56:09.107]  They've had Rob Reiner say it's a civil war.
[01:56:09.147 --> 01:56:10.948]  They say they want to overthrow the whole system.
[01:56:11.268 --> 01:56:11.949]  They want to have a
[01:56:12.429 --> 01:56:15.491]  Right, and people say, oh come on, China's never going to invade America.
[01:56:15.531 --> 01:56:15.891]  Maybe not.
[01:56:15.911 --> 01:56:17.653]  They might have their own problems.
[01:56:17.773 --> 01:56:21.075]  If America is in collapse, the rest of the world will have major problems at the same time.
[01:56:21.095 --> 01:56:24.117]  But the globalists don't care because they're ideological.
[01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:25.298]  They want control.
[01:56:42.268 --> 01:56:44.109]  It's their religion.
[01:56:44.329 --> 01:56:52.732]  Socialist globalism is their religion, which is why they're easy allies with Islamists, which is another form of totalitarianism.
[01:56:53.192 --> 01:56:59.174]  So they both have the mutual enemy of a free United States of America, which they need to destroy.
[01:56:59.434 --> 01:57:01.155]  And it's happening on multiple phases.
[01:57:01.535 --> 01:57:03.695]  That's what the deep state coup is all about.
[01:57:04.396 --> 01:57:07.897]  This was the Strzok and McCabe's insurance policy,
[01:57:08.715 --> 01:57:09.195]  We're good.
[01:57:27.062 --> 01:57:29.664]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:57:52.116 --> 01:58:03.642]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[01:58:03.683 --> 01:58:04.643]  We're exposed to lead.
[01:58:04.683 --> 01:58:05.704]  We're exposed to mercury.
[01:58:05.744 --> 01:58:10.726]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[01:58:11.127 --> 01:58:16.129]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[01:58:16.230 --> 01:58:18.351]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[01:58:19.151 --> 01:58:20.533]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[01:58:20.653 --> 01:58:24.276]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[01:58:24.396 --> 01:58:29.381]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[01:58:29.741 --> 01:58:35.186]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:58:35.587 --> 01:58:40.812]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[01:58:41.172 --> 01:58:42.113]  And over and over again.
[01:58:42.173 --> 01:58:49.079]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[01:58:49.299 --> 01:58:51.481]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[01:58:51.501 --> 01:58:53.143]  I mean, this is so massive.
[01:58:53.223 --> 01:59:06.534]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland.
[01:59:06.554 --> 01:59:07.195]  Fertility is key.
[01:59:07.735 --> 01:59:24.325]  Fertility, but all your glands are what really, your pituitary gland which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[01:59:24.725 --> 01:59:28.728]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[01:59:28.748 --> 01:59:34.151]  When you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying, all of a sudden it was like BOOM!
[01:59:34.631 --> 01:59:37.693]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:07.356 --> 02:00:11.519]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:15.782]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.103 --> 02:00:19.204]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to host the fourth hour.
[02:00:19.284 --> 02:00:22.186]  Always explosive, always incisive, always powerful.
[02:00:22.207 --> 02:00:25.669]  We're going to hear some big excerpts of the Ted Nugent exclusive interview.
[02:00:25.809 --> 02:00:27.050]  Firestorms when I'm calling it.
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:31.901]  And it's the best Ted Nugent interview ever.
[02:00:31.981 --> 02:00:33.622]  It's really the medicine America needs.
[02:00:33.642 --> 02:00:34.983]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:35.003 --> 02:00:36.563]  I know you guys and gals are all awake.
[02:00:37.044 --> 02:00:38.224]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[02:00:38.644 --> 02:00:39.765]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:00:39.785 --> 02:00:40.165]  It's free.
[02:00:40.385 --> 02:00:41.266]  It's an hour and a half long.
[02:00:41.666 --> 02:00:42.266]  It's amazing.
[02:00:42.346 --> 02:00:44.547]  Inside his house, out there shooting, talking to him and his wife.
[02:00:45.008 --> 02:00:45.528]  It's in-depth.
[02:00:45.608 --> 02:00:46.128]  It's amazing.
[02:00:46.508 --> 02:00:47.889]  Firestorm the Ted Nugent interview.
[02:00:47.949 --> 02:00:49.590]  Infowars.com.
[02:00:51.751 --> 02:00:57.754]  The Democrats have run full-page ads in the New York Times calling for civil war to overthrow the president.
[02:00:59.077 --> 02:01:00.779]  Rob Reiner has said we're in a civil war.
[02:01:01.059 --> 02:01:02.380]  You got hashtag hunt Republicans.
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.641]  You've got all the calls for violence.
[02:01:04.281 --> 02:01:08.925]  You've got Jim Carrey coming out, you know in this in this photo we can put up on screen if we can.
[02:01:09.545 --> 02:01:17.050]  This new painting showing nothing but white people and Hitler, Heiling, myself and Sean Hannity.
[02:01:19.092 --> 02:01:24.476]  Now how racist is that to say white people are all racist and they're bad and
[02:01:26.533 --> 02:01:27.174]  And expand that.
[02:01:27.214 --> 02:01:28.496]  That's not the expanded photo.
[02:01:28.717 --> 02:01:29.297]  Like, click on it.
[02:01:29.338 --> 02:01:30.980]  I want to show... That's not the expanded either.
[02:01:31.401 --> 02:01:32.382]  It's this weird, weird thing.
[02:01:32.422 --> 02:01:33.164]  I just really want it.
[02:01:33.204 --> 02:01:35.728]  I really want to... You just go to that Twitter and click the image.
[02:01:35.768 --> 02:01:36.208]  There you go.
[02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:36.870]  There you go.
[02:01:37.711 --> 02:01:38.292]  So that's it.
[02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.929]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:40.469 --> 02:01:50.773]  So I'm going to hand over the rest of this segment the next to Matt Bracken, who's getting into the climate, the preparations, everything, the way they're building up Hogg like he's God, the way you can't criticize Hogg.
[02:01:51.993 --> 02:01:52.473]  And I agree.
[02:01:52.493 --> 02:01:54.974]  I've said that before, Bracken, I wanted to bring this up.
[02:01:55.034 --> 02:01:57.995]  I've said, man, if the globalists set him up as a martyr,
[02:01:58.868 --> 02:02:00.049]  And then all the things he's pushed.
[02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:02.110]  And then we've got Hogg out there.
[02:02:02.130 --> 02:02:09.396]  No one's challenged it on his own Reddit, saying that he wants to come back as a... Well, that's Prince Charles and Prince Philip, won't come back as a virus to kill you.
[02:02:09.416 --> 02:02:15.060]  He says he wants viruses, you know, basically, and mosquitoes to reduce population, billions of people.
[02:02:15.821 --> 02:02:17.722]  It's just a crazy globalist religion.
[02:02:17.782 --> 02:02:20.464]  So we only got a few minutes here, 10 minutes next segment for you to finish up.
[02:02:20.484 --> 02:02:23.126]  But getting into the globalist religion, you're sort of getting into that.
[02:02:23.527 --> 02:02:27.330]  This really is their religion, is just pull down the West, attack Christianity,
[02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:31.092]  They'll ally with anything, as long as it's anti-Western.
[02:02:31.133 --> 02:02:35.116]  It's like their little baby ducks that imprinted on hating America and progress.
[02:02:37.237 --> 02:02:42.942]  At the top of this pyramid, and it goes back hundreds of years, what was the guy's name?
[02:02:42.962 --> 02:02:44.183]  I think it's Adam Weisskopf.
[02:02:45.023 --> 02:02:47.325]  Adam Weisskopf, Ingolstadt University, absolutely.
[02:02:47.365 --> 02:02:48.006]  Cecil Rhodes.
[02:02:48.846 --> 02:02:49.747]  Right.
[02:02:50.107 --> 02:02:53.310]  Before the French Revolution, the Illuminati already existed.
[02:02:54.088 --> 02:02:56.308]  They grafted themselves into France.
[02:02:56.348 --> 02:02:57.309]  They were kicked out of Germany.
[02:02:57.629 --> 02:03:01.990]  He came to France, started the Jacobins, which were just named for a hall that they met in.
[02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:05.230]  The Jacobins then kicked off the bloody French Revolution.
[02:03:06.091 --> 02:03:22.454]  They contrived an artificial food shortage using speculation that they could then blame on the free market system, the Catholic Church, etc., in order to spur their bloody French Revolution, the revolution of the guillotine, people's collectives.
[02:03:23.018 --> 02:03:30.482]  The Committees of Public Safety, it's interesting, the French Revolution, the people that brought out the guillotines, they were called the Committee of Public Safety.
[02:03:30.883 --> 02:03:34.585]  That's why we always hear we need to get rid of our firearms, for public safety.
[02:03:35.005 --> 02:03:39.287]  Every dictator, before they take away the firearms, they say that it's in the name of public safety.
[02:03:39.728 --> 02:03:43.310]  That the Turks disarmed the Armenians before they slaughtered them.
[02:03:43.730 --> 02:03:47.252]  That the Nazis disarmed the Jews and others before they slaughtered them.
[02:03:48.158 --> 02:03:51.382]  There's a meme going around that says, you know, why gun control?
[02:03:51.742 --> 02:03:54.646]  Because armed people won't get on boxcars voluntarily.
[02:03:54.666 --> 02:03:56.788]  And that's the long game.
[02:03:57.789 --> 02:04:00.893]  Going back to the very beginning with the Illuminati,
[02:04:02.484 --> 02:04:15.198]  Weisskopf also considered naming, instead of the Illuminists, he was going to name it the Hive Society, where you have a cast of super queen bees that are going to run all the drones.
[02:04:15.258 --> 02:04:16.039]  We're the drones.
[02:04:16.519 --> 02:04:18.762]  So you have these giant braniacs,
[02:04:19.242 --> 02:04:19.583]  That's right.
[02:04:39.125 --> 02:04:44.649]  And what they see with the bitter clingers, us deplorables, we're rowing the wrong way.
[02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:47.652]  They have to force us to row the right way.
[02:04:47.672 --> 02:04:49.773]  That's right, we're supposed to be the drones, they're the gods.
[02:04:49.913 --> 02:04:52.335]  And so they enter society to make us dumb so they can control us.
[02:04:52.655 --> 02:05:01.082]  You're absolutely right, the Illuminati was set up to enslave everybody, set up a new ultimate class that they sold to the general public as working together and having no classes.
[02:05:04.147 --> 02:05:10.252]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[02:05:10.452 --> 02:05:18.718]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[02:05:18.858 --> 02:05:23.582]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[02:05:23.942 --> 02:05:24.663]  We only have 150%.
[02:05:24.703 --> 02:05:25.824]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[02:05:27.665 --> 02:05:29.947]  Well now it's 50% off.
[02:05:30.487 --> 02:05:38.894]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[02:05:38.914 --> 02:05:40.435]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[02:05:40.735 --> 02:05:42.116]  But the two go together.
[02:05:42.236 --> 02:05:43.898]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[02:05:44.258 --> 02:05:48.621]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[02:05:49.842 --> 02:05:53.466]  And free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:58.552]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[02:05:58.952 --> 02:06:03.277]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[02:06:21.528 --> 02:06:27.933]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:28.033 --> 02:06:29.575]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.475 --> 02:06:34.779]  Alright, Matt Bracken, author, anti-terrorism expert, former Navy SEAL, really smart guy.
[02:06:36.132 --> 02:06:47.340]  He is breaking down, and I've got this write-up he sent me that he wanted to cover, and you might, in this ten minutes we have, just go over this, because you lay it all out, and it absolutely would be the move I would make if I was the globalist.
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:58.949]  Just like we said, the season of false flags is here right before Vegas, the stand-downs are here, we're not saying nobody got killed, we're not saying it's fake, we're saying the doors are all left open, the checks that are there are
[02:07:00.131 --> 02:07:06.358]  Turned off, and I've talked to CIA, FBI contacts, they say absolutely Islamists, absolute stand down.
[02:07:07.039 --> 02:07:10.122]  And these sources have been spot on on every piece of information we've gotten.
[02:07:10.963 --> 02:07:17.330]  And, you know, we know they're trying to get EMPs into the Middle East, they're firing ICBMs, and the whole civil war between Iran and
[02:07:18.451 --> 02:07:18.752]  I think
[02:07:33.368 --> 02:07:34.709]  It's not just about America.
[02:07:34.769 --> 02:07:36.609]  The globalists want the country taken out.
[02:07:36.649 --> 02:07:37.670]  It's not even so much about taking it over.
[02:07:37.690 --> 02:07:39.390]  They want it neutralized.
[02:07:39.410 --> 02:07:40.551]  They want it deindustrialized.
[02:07:41.071 --> 02:07:42.592]  And Trump's trying to bring the country back.
[02:07:42.612 --> 02:07:44.312]  So how will they use a false flag to derail things?
[02:08:02.062 --> 02:08:06.103]  Well, yeah, you have to, the way that I look at it, the Second Amendment is not the target.
[02:08:07.064 --> 02:08:10.185]  Of course it is, it's a preliminary target, but it's a step.
[02:08:10.385 --> 02:08:13.326]  It's an uprising mobilizer to get their people in the streets.
[02:08:14.086 --> 02:08:15.447]  And to get a reaction.
[02:08:15.507 --> 02:08:22.829]  What they want is a civil war, a dirty civil war, to turn America into something that looks like Spain in the 30s or Argentina in the 70s.
[02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:31.512]  You know, assassinations, IEDs, you know, people, something that's important to realize, unlike countries, say, in South America, the Middle East,
[02:08:32.193 --> 02:08:41.438]  In those countries, the elites live in fortified condo complexes, things like that, walled complexes with great security out to rifle range.
[02:08:41.879 --> 02:08:45.281]  They don't leave unless they're in an SUV armada.
[02:08:46.541 --> 02:08:52.345]  But in the United States, the people that run our government, they're called the Senior Executive Service, the SES grade.
[02:08:52.885 --> 02:08:54.327]  Used to be nicknamed Supergrades.
[02:08:54.727 --> 02:08:56.508]  They're above GS-15 level.
[02:08:56.548 --> 02:08:58.290]  They're the generals that never go away.
[02:08:58.310 --> 02:09:02.354]  They're the civilian, clothes-wearing generals of the bureaucracy.
[02:09:02.834 --> 02:09:04.716]  They are the deep state, the SCSs.
[02:09:05.256 --> 02:09:11.061]  The SCSs do not live like they would if they lived in Brazil or in Colombia in a fortified compound.
[02:09:11.341 --> 02:09:18.688]  They live in Bethesda, Chevy Chase, Falls Church, Virginia, in beautiful homes, but where you can just drive up to their driveway.
[02:09:19.648 --> 02:09:31.872]  If a civil war kicks off in this country, our elites, not just the senior executive service, but corporate titans, etc., their lives will be turned upside down because they don't have rifle range protection.
[02:09:32.372 --> 02:09:43.435]  This is a country, it's almost a perfect storm, this is a country like Switzerland where a large percentage of the country could walk into their gun safe today, open their gun safe,
[02:09:44.511 --> 02:09:49.516]  Blindfolded, pull out a rifle, and hit a mailbox 400 yards away, standing up.
[02:09:50.297 --> 02:09:53.060]  This is hard for liberals to fathom.
[02:09:53.501 --> 02:09:58.406]  They mistake conservative lack of reaction for weakness.
[02:09:58.606 --> 02:10:00.548]  We're just weak and afraid to resist them.
[02:10:01.049 --> 02:10:05.954]  What they're mistaking is our deep Judeo-Christian forbearance and tolerance.
[02:10:06.574 --> 02:10:13.097]  But there are millions of Americans that right now can walk out and hit a mailbox-sized target 400 yards away.
[02:10:13.117 --> 02:10:13.558]  That's right.
[02:10:13.598 --> 02:10:17.880]  And instead of running around bitching and playing, they're making preparations in case they have to.
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:19.200]  And that's the issue you're getting at.
[02:10:19.441 --> 02:10:23.743]  But like William Benny, he was the equivalent of a two-star general heading up the NSA technical division.
[02:10:23.763 --> 02:10:27.805]  There's also patriots on the inside that get and understand
[02:10:28.865 --> 02:10:32.167]  What a tinderbox this is already and are trying to de-escalate things.
[02:10:32.467 --> 02:10:34.568]  But Soros is trying to throw fuel on the fire.
[02:10:35.028 --> 02:10:36.128]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:10:36.308 --> 02:10:40.750]  If they continue to push this in the battle space, they're the ones wanting a violent civil war.
[02:10:40.770 --> 02:10:49.434]  We're not saying that, but we should be publicly listing the individuals and groups and the governing civilian commander class.
[02:10:50.405 --> 02:10:52.366]  That is to blame for this.
[02:10:52.566 --> 02:11:00.210]  If they kick it off, we shouldn't have a dumb civil war with the cops, or with a bunch of, you know, brainwashed minority folks, or white folks.
[02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:06.694]  We should understand this was a shake-and-beg operation, and people should be talking about, who is the globalist in my city?
[02:11:07.054 --> 02:11:10.736]  And where do they live, just in case we know where they're at?
[02:11:11.717 --> 02:11:15.679]  Right, and once this kicks off, it will be almost impossible to stop.
[02:11:16.306 --> 02:11:20.188]  Because the people that are the big decision makers, they'll have to flee.
[02:11:20.808 --> 02:11:23.329]  It's going to be a bloodbath if this happens.
[02:11:23.509 --> 02:11:35.274]  And I would say that the vast majority of the people that march in the feminist marches, the gun control marches, they're what I call, you know, they're just useful idiots, well-intentioned useful idiots.
[02:11:35.734 --> 02:11:42.317]  And in the case of the Children's Crusade, I call them youthful idiots, well-intentioned youthful idiots, like David Hogg.
[02:11:43.217 --> 02:11:46.279]  He might get his wish of immortality, but it'll be as a martyr.
[02:11:46.299 --> 02:11:47.859]  Yeah, let's talk more about that.
[02:11:47.879 --> 02:11:49.580]  They're gonna spin it that we want David Hawk dead.
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:50.480]  That's the last thing we want.
[02:11:50.921 --> 02:12:04.827]  I agree, it'd be a good globalist move for them to attack... Oh, did you see the two black folks that were connected to the army out of Texas, up in Boston, caught with a bunch of hand grenades and guns, and they called the police on themselves?
[02:12:05.956 --> 02:12:06.176]  No.
[02:12:06.436 --> 02:12:07.757]  Oh my gosh, you didn't get any attention.
[02:12:07.997 --> 02:12:09.257]  Guys, pull that up from Monday.
[02:12:09.277 --> 02:12:13.178]  A group arrested with guns and hand grenades in Boston.
[02:12:13.298 --> 02:12:18.599]  They were right over the Children's March, the anti-gun march, and they had hand grenades and guns and all this.
[02:12:18.619 --> 02:12:19.540]  It got almost no attention.
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:31.763]  They called the police on themselves, had a surveillance camera in the hotel to see what the police would do, said they were secret government agents but won't say what, and the guy does have a DOD handgun license and all this other crazy stuff.
[02:12:32.083 --> 02:12:34.264]  See, that got almost no attention.
[02:12:34.284 --> 02:12:34.984]  What do you think that is?
[02:12:36.052 --> 02:12:40.935]  Well, sometimes you have these like what they call red cell teams that are testing security.
[02:12:41.556 --> 02:12:47.980]  Sometimes these red cell teams can be bogus, or sometimes that can be a cover in case they're discovered.
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:50.362]  Oh, we were just doing a security check.
[02:12:50.902 --> 02:13:02.591]  You know, if they feel like they've been compromised, their fallback cover for action is, oh, we were doing a private security check just to show we were going to put it on the media how lax the security was.
[02:13:03.051 --> 02:13:05.633]  That's if they figure that they were compromised along the way.
[02:13:06.233 --> 02:13:08.235]  So yeah, we're in very perilous times.
[02:13:08.295 --> 02:13:10.598]  The globalists push on every track that they can.
[02:13:11.098 --> 02:13:14.621]  What they're trying to do is keep us too busy, you know, like playing whack-a-mole.
[02:13:15.442 --> 02:13:20.547]  Meanwhile, we're being set up for the big one, which will be something like a concert or a stadium massacre.
[02:13:21.008 --> 02:13:25.192]  It will be by globalists against globalists.
[02:13:25.912 --> 02:13:33.459]  Or some right-wing lunatic will be known and then allowed to carry out the attack, because it suits their narrative.
[02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:36.682]  Remember, they believe the ends justify the means.
[02:13:37.102 --> 02:13:40.345]  Like Mal said, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
[02:13:41.065 --> 02:13:48.552]  We're just a bunch of dumb drones, and for our own good, they've got to manipulate us and get us running like a herd of sheep right off a cliff.
[02:13:49.233 --> 02:14:01.181]  And I just want people not to take at first face value if they see somebody like a David Hogg assassinated, you know, probably up close like Indira Gandhi or Anwar Sadat.
[02:14:02.342 --> 02:14:05.404]  But if they see that, don't accept the initial explanation.
[02:14:05.444 --> 02:14:13.170]  It'll turn out to be some, you know, right-wing militia kook that did it and he's killed at the scene, you know, which is like the plot of this novel, sort of.
[02:14:14.082 --> 02:14:15.465]  Opens at a stadium massacre.
[02:14:15.805 --> 02:14:17.769]  But this is the kind of thing we're being geared up.
[02:14:17.849 --> 02:14:25.582]  The reason I wrote that novel is to try to de-escalate the chances of it ever happening by saying, look, fellas, it won't work because we won't believe it.
[02:14:25.998 --> 02:14:29.419]  You know, you're going to have to think of something else other than an assault rifle massacre.
[02:14:29.819 --> 02:14:36.681]  Well, after Las Vegas and the church in Texas and so forth, I'm not saying that the FBI does these things.
[02:14:36.761 --> 02:14:40.682]  I'm saying they might not exactly be pursuing them with all due diligence.
[02:14:41.142 --> 02:14:44.323]  Either that or they're the most incompetent bunch on the history of the planet.
[02:14:44.343 --> 02:14:45.444]  Let me ask you this real quick.
[02:14:46.764 --> 02:14:49.007]  Pulse Nightclub, the guy's father is FBI informant.
[02:14:49.087 --> 02:14:50.689]  And the other guy connected to the FBI as well.
[02:14:51.170 --> 02:14:56.537]  Why do you think they're attacking InfoWars so much and are almost as obsessed with us as they are Trump?
[02:14:56.617 --> 02:14:58.219]  What are they so scared of?
[02:14:59.534 --> 02:15:03.156]  Well, like me, I can relate to this.
[02:15:03.636 --> 02:15:10.259]  When you're ahead of the herd, even a lot of people in the herd will say, oh, he's too far out.
[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:13.381]  Well, our vision might be a little further ahead of the herd.
[02:15:13.721 --> 02:15:15.482]  They need to snip us out.
[02:15:15.522 --> 02:15:17.043]  They need to blot us out.
[02:15:18.184 --> 02:15:23.390]  They can't steer the herd and stampede that herd towards the Buffalo Jump if there's somebody over there saying... Exactly.
[02:15:23.410 --> 02:15:31.598]  They don't want us there stopping the stampede, stopping their psychology agenda, because they know we've derailed their operations over and over again.
[02:15:32.159 --> 02:15:32.900]  Which is easy to do.
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:34.241]  The public doesn't already buy any of it.
[02:15:34.462 --> 02:15:36.183]  We just point out anomalies and it's game over.
[02:15:37.004 --> 02:15:37.225]  Right.
[02:15:37.873 --> 02:15:38.273]  That's right.
[02:15:38.314 --> 02:15:44.620]  We're being steered for a buffalo jump, and we're pointing out that the Indians with the blankets are not, you know, the friends of the buffaloes.
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:51.066]  I can tell you, Matt, InfoWars itself, with our audience and all our guests, we've blown over 60 major globalist operations.
[02:15:51.246 --> 02:15:51.607]  Big ones.
[02:15:52.007 --> 02:15:53.268]  Some of them billion-dollar operations.
[02:15:53.288 --> 02:15:54.650]  We've blown them sky-high.
[02:15:55.130 --> 02:15:56.572]  EnemiesForeignDomestic.com.
[02:15:56.852 --> 02:15:57.713]  Thank you, Matt Bracken.
[02:15:57.753 --> 02:15:58.173]  We love you.
[02:15:58.193 --> 02:15:59.555]  We'll be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:16:03.061 --> 02:16:12.505]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[02:16:13.085 --> 02:16:17.747]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[02:16:18.407 --> 02:16:29.752]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[02:16:30.632 --> 02:16:44.020]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:49.983]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[02:16:50.464 --> 02:16:51.905]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat,
[02:16:52.745 --> 02:16:53.586]  And a lot of protein.
[02:16:54.107 --> 02:16:55.489]  You don't chew it properly sometimes.
[02:16:55.529 --> 02:16:56.169]  There's buildup.
[02:16:56.189 --> 02:16:59.834]  You can even rot inside your guts causing diverticulitis.
[02:17:00.014 --> 02:17:00.555]  You name it.
[02:17:01.115 --> 02:17:03.478]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[02:17:04.571 --> 02:17:12.036]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[02:17:12.556 --> 02:17:24.525]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[02:17:24.845 --> 02:17:27.387]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[02:17:28.007 --> 02:17:32.010]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:34.272]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[02:17:34.712 --> 02:17:48.562]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[02:17:48.782 --> 02:17:55.007]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits from proven high-quality probiotics
[02:17:55.367 --> 02:18:00.172]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[02:18:00.512 --> 02:18:03.394]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[02:18:03.835 --> 02:18:05.617]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:06.097 --> 02:18:16.426]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[02:18:17.547 --> 02:18:19.689]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[02:18:20.848 --> 02:18:33.655]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[02:18:34.255 --> 02:18:43.440]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[02:18:44.969 --> 02:18:46.711]  This is the total win-win.
[02:18:47.231 --> 02:18:52.936]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[02:18:53.497 --> 02:18:57.901]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[02:18:58.221 --> 02:19:03.706]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:19:04.227 --> 02:19:07.310]  Many probiotics out there don't even have
[02:19:07.890 --> 02:19:08.130]  Yeah.
[02:19:25.908 --> 02:19:29.449]  Two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[02:19:29.809 --> 02:19:35.470]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[02:19:35.950 --> 02:19:40.632]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[02:19:41.232 --> 02:19:50.254]  Whether it's Floral Life, Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[02:19:51.351 --> 02:19:55.072]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[02:19:55.272 --> 02:20:03.094]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:20:06.755 --> 02:20:09.376]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:24.798 --> 02:20:26.961]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:27.442 --> 02:20:32.610]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:34.983 --> 02:20:42.147]  Well, President Trump is speaking live with representatives, leaders of the Baltic nations, Hungary, you name it.
[02:20:43.108 --> 02:20:58.877]  Those countries have been classically dominated by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, or they have been dominated by Russia, and he's meeting with them, but he's also just said, he's live right now, but he just said, let's back up a few seconds if we can, the President just said that
[02:21:00.106 --> 02:21:02.228]  During the break, he wants to work with Russia.
[02:21:02.588 --> 02:21:06.052]  Well, Putin knows he's meeting with them and he said, listen, we want to meet right now.
[02:21:06.532 --> 02:21:11.977]  You've already met with all of these other foreign leaders that are much smaller countries than us.
[02:21:12.418 --> 02:21:13.659]  You're not meeting with us.
[02:21:13.699 --> 02:21:15.761]  You're being bullied into not having any day time.
[02:21:16.642 --> 02:21:18.544]  So this is a good thing Trump just said.
[02:21:19.064 --> 02:21:21.546]  Donald Trump has met with the enemy of Russia.
[02:21:22.327 --> 02:21:22.828]  Collusion.
[02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:24.412]  It's his own Justice Department.
[02:21:24.432 --> 02:21:27.219]  So they're trying to spin all that right now.
[02:21:27.279 --> 02:21:30.989]  Let's go ahead and go to the President while he's speaking.
[02:21:32.071 --> 02:21:37.116]  And you can, and I know you're nodding yes, because everyone agrees when they think about it.
[02:21:37.616 --> 02:21:39.578]  Strong energy, the United States.
[02:21:39.959 --> 02:21:44.363]  My opponent was into other forms of energy, like windmills.
[02:21:45.344 --> 02:21:48.166]  We're very strong on energy.
[02:21:48.226 --> 02:21:51.189]  We're essentially now energy independent.
[02:21:51.309 --> 02:21:52.570]  We're an exporter of energy.
[02:21:53.171 --> 02:21:55.493]  That is not a positive for Russia.
[02:21:56.514 --> 02:21:58.676]  But it's certainly a positive for the United States.
[02:21:59.217 --> 02:22:02.541]  We just passed a $700 billion military budget.
[02:22:02.601 --> 02:22:06.104]  Next year, $716 billion, the largest ever passed.
[02:22:07.025 --> 02:22:10.589]  We are going to have a military stronger than we've ever had before, by far.
[02:22:11.470 --> 02:22:15.474]  That's not exactly a great thing for Russia.
[02:22:16.639 --> 02:22:17.800]  But that's the way it is.
[02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:20.383]  We're going to have the strongest military that we ever had.
[02:22:21.204 --> 02:22:21.584]  NATO.
[02:22:21.984 --> 02:22:23.125]  NATO was delinquent.
[02:22:23.406 --> 02:22:24.947]  They were not paying their bills.
[02:22:25.007 --> 02:22:25.848]  They were not paying.
[02:22:25.888 --> 02:22:31.073]  A lot of states, as we discussed, they were not paying what they should be paying.
[02:22:31.854 --> 02:22:38.600]  Since I came in, many, many billions of dollars additional have been paid by countries that weren't paying, and now they're paying.
[02:22:39.761 --> 02:22:42.082]  And they will have to pay more, frankly.
[02:22:42.102 --> 02:22:43.043]  They're going to have to pay more.
[02:22:43.763 --> 02:22:49.926]  So there are many things that I've done, and not only the 60 diplomats.
[02:22:50.126 --> 02:22:51.086]  Germany did four.
[02:22:51.267 --> 02:22:52.267]  France did four.
[02:22:53.067 --> 02:22:53.387]  We did 60.
[02:22:54.668 --> 02:22:57.891]  There's nobody been tougher on Russia.
[02:22:58.031 --> 02:23:03.495]  And with that being said, I think I could have a very good relationship with President Putin.
[02:23:03.615 --> 02:23:03.956]  I think.
[02:23:04.596 --> 02:23:05.617]  It's possible I won't.
[02:23:05.737 --> 02:23:06.778]  And you will know about it.
[02:23:07.238 --> 02:23:10.381]  Believe me, this room will know about it before I know about it.
[02:23:11.202 --> 02:23:14.464]  It's a real possibility that I could have a good relationship.
[02:23:14.925 --> 02:23:18.367]  And remember this, getting along with Russia is a good thing.
[02:23:18.407 --> 02:23:21.009]  Getting along with China is a good thing.
[02:23:21.770 --> 02:23:26.335]  Getting along with other countries, including your three countries, is a good thing, not a bad thing.
[02:23:27.116 --> 02:23:37.648]  So, I think I could have a very good relationship with Russia, and with President Putin, and if I did, that would be a great thing, and there's also a great possibility that that won't happen.
[02:23:38.649 --> 02:23:39.089]  Who knows?
[02:23:40.325 --> 02:23:40.565]  Okay?
[02:23:41.046 --> 02:23:41.386]  Thank you.
[02:23:41.947 --> 02:23:42.227]  Okay.
[02:23:43.108 --> 02:23:47.373]  If I may, Marianne, I would also like to contribute a little bit to your first question.
[02:23:47.493 --> 02:23:54.060]  As I reminded you all, we could trust the judgment of United States administrations and people even while we were occupied.
[02:23:54.641 --> 02:24:00.007]  We could trust your judgment when we regained independence and seek membership of NATO, for example.
[02:24:00.447 --> 02:24:03.168]  We could, because we are on a common foundation.
[02:24:03.588 --> 02:24:06.508]  You can walk around the mall and read, it's all written there.
[02:24:06.788 --> 02:24:13.430]  This foundation, our compass for both, and therefore I trust the judgement of President Trump and his administration on that matter too.
[02:24:13.930 --> 02:24:26.873]  Now on your concrete question on air defence, yes we did discuss the deterrence capacity necessary to make sure that our deterrence is believable to everybody who might want to cushion it.
[02:24:27.373 --> 02:24:30.496]  But you know, equal partners don't come to talk to each other this way.
[02:24:31.016 --> 02:24:37.122]  I come here to Washington to ask for visa freedom, or I come here to ask for, let's say, may you support me for this or for that.
[02:24:37.542 --> 02:24:38.283]  Let's stop right there.
[02:24:39.184 --> 02:24:46.270]  Estonia is a NATO globalist puppet state that's constantly claiming Russia's doing stuff to them and trying to start some war.
[02:24:48.332 --> 02:24:54.037]  Again, this is just the endlessness, and Trump has been bullied on the few failures into not meeting with
[02:24:55.558 --> 02:24:55.858]  Putin
[02:25:14.409 --> 02:25:20.591]  G7 and G20 events and shook his hand, but they're like, oh, he was sitting across the table and waved at him and said something.
[02:25:20.631 --> 02:25:21.152]  What was it?
[02:25:21.572 --> 02:25:24.573]  This idea that the president can't even talk to foreign heads of state.
[02:25:24.853 --> 02:25:26.634]  It's a separate branch of government.
[02:25:27.814 --> 02:25:29.015]  He's supposed to be talking to it.
[02:25:29.335 --> 02:25:32.856]  So the way they've paralyzed talking to Russia.
[02:25:32.976 --> 02:25:34.117]  I have no Russian stocks.
[02:25:34.197 --> 02:25:35.297]  I'm not involved in Russia.
[02:25:35.397 --> 02:25:37.458]  I'm not like Hillary getting $100 million plus from it.
[02:25:38.587 --> 02:25:40.749]  Or Mueller on tarmacs giving him uranium.
[02:25:40.789 --> 02:25:41.790]  Imagine if Trump had done that.
[02:25:41.810 --> 02:25:43.032]  They'd crucify him.
[02:25:43.232 --> 02:25:44.213]  They'd hang him by his toes.
[02:25:47.336 --> 02:25:58.388]  But Putin's watching Trump meet with these Baltic nations, some of which are good, some of which are neutral, some of which don't like us, some of which are globalists, some of which are EU puppets.
[02:25:58.788 --> 02:25:59.830]  He's like, you gotta meet with me!
[02:26:01.158 --> 02:26:04.839]  So Trump really is paralyzed on the optics of meeting with Putin.
[02:26:05.139 --> 02:26:18.203]  And I think he should have probably met with Putin first, made a big joke out of it, and said, we're about to massively, you know, increase our energy output, and that's going to mess you up Vlad, and, you know, I'm going to beef up our military, but we want to work with you.
[02:26:18.523 --> 02:26:20.444]  We're not going to try to take over these countries on your border.
[02:26:22.004 --> 02:26:23.244]  But instead, that's not happened.
[02:26:23.264 --> 02:26:24.965]  This is one of, I think, Trump's failings, quite frankly.
[02:26:25.285 --> 02:26:26.565]  But Dr. Zero, of course, he joins us.
[02:26:26.585 --> 02:26:28.386]  We'll talk about this in the next segment and some other things.
[02:26:30.253 --> 02:26:36.317]  You were the guy that first said 80% of the bots that came out of Russia, and there was a very small amount of them, were actually pro-Hillary.
[02:26:36.357 --> 02:26:39.380]  That's now all been confirmed, running protests for Michael Moore.
[02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:48.006]  It's really outrageous how the Democrats had been heavily selling out to anybody that would pay them, like a $10 whore, and had gotten some Russian money.
[02:26:48.046 --> 02:26:51.248]  But what is your real view on this, and how long will this go?
[02:26:51.308 --> 02:26:52.729]  Because Trump really is starting to
[02:26:53.650 --> 02:26:58.913]  Provocatively build up troops on Russia's border, really cut things off, really push Russia around.
[02:26:59.253 --> 02:27:02.254]  He's standing up to China some too, but they're actually in our life.
[02:27:02.274 --> 02:27:04.375]  They're actually running our business, as you know.
[02:27:04.395 --> 02:27:06.956]  I just don't see the big fault with Russia.
[02:27:06.976 --> 02:27:07.977]  I'm not a Russophile.
[02:27:08.497 --> 02:27:15.120]  I just see it as a giant red herring to the globalist threat here inside our country that's orchestrating the caravan, the invasion, all of this crap.
[02:27:16.881 --> 02:27:18.802]  Well, I think, Alex, it's clear that
[02:27:19.497 --> 02:27:27.675]  The Democrats created this whole Russian narrative because Hillary and Putin, as I show in Killing the Deep State, were being paid.
[02:27:27.715 --> 02:27:29.459]  They were virtually on the payroll of Putin.
[02:27:30.043 --> 02:27:40.109]  And they wanted to divert attention from the money they were getting for selling military technology to Russia under Reset and the Uranium One deal.
[02:27:41.049 --> 02:27:49.254]  I detail the bank accounts where they got the money, the offshore accounts where Putin was paying Hillary and Podesta.
[02:27:49.934 --> 02:27:54.036]  And the oligarchs, the organized crime figures that were involved.
[02:27:54.076 --> 02:27:59.918]  I mean, of course it's normal for us to talk, for the President of the United States to talk with the head of Russia.
[02:28:00.598 --> 02:28:05.359]  And the idea that the Democrats have engaged in this reverse McCarthyism is absurd.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.520]  It's bizarre.
[02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:11.023]  And Donald Trump, I think, has now proven there was no Russia collusion.
[02:28:11.663 --> 02:28:18.808]  I believe Mueller's out of gas, and it's time for Donald Trump to normalize our relationships with all countries in the world, including Russia.
[02:28:18.928 --> 02:28:22.510]  So you agree with me that, I mean, how many months are we into the administration right now?
[02:28:23.396 --> 02:28:30.138]  Well, we're into the second year, and I agree with you entirely that this is, you know, it's beyond time.
[02:28:30.178 --> 02:28:35.660]  It's past time for us to be, for Trump to be having a summit with Putin.
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:40.541]  You know, Obama did it, and he numerous times, and he promised he'd have greater flexibility.
[02:28:40.601 --> 02:28:44.062]  And it would let Trump take control of the narrative during a two or three day summit.
[02:28:44.502 --> 02:28:46.843]  He could totally take control of the narrative and kill it all at once.
[02:28:46.883 --> 02:28:49.084]  He should have done it two or three months in, he should have done it.
[02:28:50.355 --> 02:28:50.856]  It's crazy.
[02:28:51.997 --> 02:28:53.198]  I just know Trump's wrong on this.
[02:28:53.818 --> 02:28:55.139]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:55.199 --> 02:28:56.781]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:28:56.801 --> 02:28:58.442]  We've got a lot of other news to cover.
[02:28:58.462 --> 02:28:59.883]  We've got Jerome Corsi on the other side.
[02:28:59.903 --> 02:29:00.644]  The latest on QAnon.
[02:29:02.145 --> 02:29:09.874]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:29:10.715 --> 02:29:14.760]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:17.623]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:29:18.404 --> 02:29:21.527]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:29:23.038 --> 02:29:35.186]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:29:35.866 --> 02:29:50.936]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:29:51.916 --> 02:29:55.620]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[02:29:56.180 --> 02:29:57.902]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:29:57.942 --> 02:30:00.184]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:30:02.782 --> 02:30:03.523]  I'm so excited.
[02:30:03.583 --> 02:30:13.129]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:30:13.729 --> 02:30:22.035]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:30:22.235 --> 02:30:31.001]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:30:33.122 --> 02:30:52.207]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:30:52.707 --> 02:30:53.987]  It is amazing!
[02:30:55.388 --> 02:31:00.349]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:31:04.403 --> 02:31:09.105]  I'm not here pitching products because I just want to get a bigger house or a bigger car.
[02:31:09.565 --> 02:31:11.106]  I need to beat these people as everybody knows.
[02:31:11.146 --> 02:31:14.447]  They are all over the news saying we want to take Alex Jones off the air.
[02:31:16.147 --> 02:31:20.269]  From Sadiq Khan to the head of YouTube, we are to the CEO of News Corp.
[02:31:21.459 --> 02:31:22.640]  In these lawsuits, Alex, I know the costs.
[02:31:46.898 --> 02:31:50.900]  My costs are up to a half a million dollars to fight the pony lawsuits.
[02:31:51.321 --> 02:32:00.586]  You're looking at millions of dollars, ultimately, to fight the lawsuits against you and against InfoWars because they're designed to silence you and shut you down.
[02:32:01.146 --> 02:32:10.412]  I tell my friends, look, even if you're not in the market for a t-shirt or you don't want the super blue fluoride free line of products right now, there's a donate button.
[02:32:11.012 --> 02:32:27.582]  If you just want to help fight for freedom, if you like what we're doing here, and you're not, just don't happen to be in the market for products that you've already got them or you're on auto ship, you can just go to the donate button and send us $25, $100, $150, $200.
[02:32:28.502 --> 02:32:36.747]  We're looking at massive, massive legal costs to fight the globalists and fight the effort to just shut us down.
[02:32:36.787 --> 02:32:37.808]  So if you love InfoWars,
[02:32:38.308 --> 02:32:40.489]  Hit that donate button.
[02:32:40.529 --> 02:32:40.929]  Exactly.
[02:32:40.969 --> 02:32:44.390]  We don't have the Annenberg and CPB and Rockefeller Foundation funding us.
[02:32:44.410 --> 02:32:53.694]  We have the listeners doing it and we're taking Soros and the globalists and Obama suing you saying you're a Russian agent and they're suing us with all this frivolous stuff.
[02:32:53.714 --> 02:32:59.096]  We're winning is why they're targeting us but people need to know this is the war for this republic.
[02:32:59.136 --> 02:32:59.736]  This is it.
[02:33:06.261 --> 02:33:10.823]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.329 --> 02:33:29.511]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[02:33:29.751 --> 02:33:31.532]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:31.752 --> 02:33:33.633]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:35.874 --> 02:33:37.735]  And that's why they hate us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:37.755 --> 02:33:39.095]  That's why they're going after us.
[02:33:39.796 --> 02:33:40.776]  My lawyers have looked at it.
[02:33:40.796 --> 02:33:43.377]  We've had a totally new... It's been two weeks since they did one.
[02:33:43.958 --> 02:33:46.419]  Just fraudulent.
[02:33:46.479 --> 02:33:47.959]  I mean, not reality-based.
[02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:49.380]  Lawsuit.
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:51.281]  We retracted it.
[02:33:52.253 --> 02:33:53.674]  We took the image down.
[02:33:54.134 --> 02:33:55.235]  Everybody else had it up there.
[02:33:55.255 --> 02:33:57.516]  We did it before them of a guy that wasn't Nick Cruz.
[02:33:57.536 --> 02:33:58.757]  It was on the news it was Nick Cruz.
[02:33:59.057 --> 02:34:00.598]  We said this is allegedly Nick Cruz.
[02:34:00.958 --> 02:34:02.479]  Didn't say the name of the guy that it was.
[02:34:02.499 --> 02:34:07.282]  This Democrat party law firm sues us saying we didn't retract, we didn't remove, we have it all.
[02:34:07.362 --> 02:34:09.343]  It was removed, retracted, registered mail.
[02:34:09.363 --> 02:34:12.245]  And then they put this big screen in the article.
[02:34:13.581 --> 02:34:16.347]  In the filing that top lawyers have looked at.
[02:34:16.387 --> 02:34:19.354]  It's even the Daily Beast even admits it and says Jones can sue them for this.
[02:34:19.614 --> 02:34:22.520]  They don't have a case, but he can sue them anti-slap back.
[02:34:23.803 --> 02:34:24.004]  So.
[02:34:26.733 --> 02:34:30.894]  It's just funny how they even get me licking my lip, like once a year I might lick my lip on air.
[02:34:31.174 --> 02:34:32.295]  They have like that freeze-framed.
[02:34:32.815 --> 02:34:35.496]  It's just all like, it's like you're fighting a bunch of junior high students.
[02:34:36.016 --> 02:34:38.457]  But it takes money to even beat fake lawsuits.
[02:34:39.257 --> 02:34:42.158]  And then I gotta do this slap back, I gotta sue these people.
[02:34:42.658 --> 02:34:48.920]  Just so the next person that gets induced by the law firms to file a lawsuit that doesn't have merits knows I'm gonna have to sue them.
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:49.840]  It's gonna take a lot of money.
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:51.281]  That's the First Amendment.
[02:34:51.821 --> 02:34:52.321]  So please,
[02:34:53.723 --> 02:34:54.724]  Shop with the good guys.

[02:35:04.229 --> 02:35:06.750]  And shows an audience of white people watching me, so anti-white.
[02:35:08.571 --> 02:35:12.854]  Last chance to get a bunch of products.

[02:35:31.230 --> 02:35:35.134]  At $150, it's incredible.

[02:35:42.561 --> 02:35:45.124]  It's just an incredible four-stage ion filter.
[02:35:46.345 --> 02:35:47.266]  Clean it like once a month.
[02:35:47.286 --> 02:35:48.648]  Just pull out the first stage.
[02:35:49.068 --> 02:35:49.729]  Water hose it off.
[02:35:49.749 --> 02:35:50.850]  We sell replacement filters.
[02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:51.752]  You get about once a year.
[02:35:51.772 --> 02:35:55.696]  We have replacement filters for the Alexa Pure water filtration systems as well.
[02:35:55.716 --> 02:35:56.698]  The lowest prices on that.
[02:35:57.318 --> 02:36:00.522]  We're the biggest distributor of the whole Alexa Pure family of water and air filters.
[02:36:00.943 --> 02:36:02.184]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:02.264 --> 02:36:03.005]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:05.151 --> 02:36:06.632]  Or AAA253-3139.
[02:36:06.652 --> 02:36:08.313]  We've got some amazing new products.
[02:36:08.893 --> 02:36:09.514]  Super Blue.
[02:36:11.275 --> 02:36:12.935]  Large bottles of the mouthwash.
[02:36:12.955 --> 02:36:13.736]  You can just swallow it though.
[02:36:13.756 --> 02:36:14.316]  It's a gargle.
[02:36:14.356 --> 02:36:15.957]  It's so healthy you can swallow it.
[02:36:15.977 --> 02:36:19.139]  It's actually a supplement with the iodine and the high quality nano silver.
[02:36:19.659 --> 02:36:20.900]  It's all there in a little spray bottle.
[02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:22.260]  You can refill with a larger bottle.
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:23.401]  And we've got those.

[02:37:08.971 --> 02:37:20.961]  Not only is it a powerful hand purifier, it can also be used orally to spray a small amount on your mouth, swish and swallow whatever you feel surrounded by toxins made by powerful yet simple ingredients.

[02:37:35.415 --> 02:37:39.700]  Okay, Dr. Corsi, the time we have is the Ted News Interview is coming up, and then Paul Watson.
[02:37:41.403 --> 02:37:43.144]  What else is on the radar with QAnon?
[02:37:43.224 --> 02:37:46.605]  Trump is striking back at the deep state, saying he'll put military on the border.
[02:37:46.925 --> 02:37:55.749]  The Soros UN-funded invasion force, like Europe, to get that first corridor through, to show them get through successfully, then it triggers everything.
[02:37:56.810 --> 02:38:01.552]  Shouldn't Trump, just under the Constitution, put the military on the border of California?
[02:38:01.852 --> 02:38:03.012]  They're involved in sedition.
[02:38:03.853 --> 02:38:07.154]  The American people are behind him, the Constitution's behind him, sovereignty's behind him.
[02:38:07.174 --> 02:38:09.375]  It's time to break the back of California and their sedition.
[02:38:10.287 --> 02:38:10.847]  Well, I agree.
[02:38:10.887 --> 02:38:19.272]  I mean, QAnon last night on a series of posts predicted that President Trump would put the military on the border.
[02:38:19.292 --> 02:38:27.576]  In a post, he said that there'd be a new immigration bill, that there's going to be a wall, and military start.
[02:38:27.636 --> 02:38:33.759]  In other words, the opportunity to defend the border from this invasion from Mexico is the beginning.
[02:38:34.554 --> 02:38:36.035]  Of Trump's use of the military.
[02:38:36.536 --> 02:38:51.748]  Remember, QAnon's been predicting, and I've been saying, and writing about for extensively, that the endgame here, the counterattack that Trump is now beginning, you know, which I detail in the killing of the state, is going to end up in military tribunals.
[02:38:51.768 --> 02:38:59.734]  It's going to end up with military tribunals that will ultimately press treason charges against both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[02:39:00.435 --> 02:39:03.958]  And I see every sign, and QAnon was telegraphing it last night,
[02:39:04.685 --> 02:39:11.528]  That we're going to now see this is the first use, but by no means the last use of the military by Donald Trump.
[02:39:13.508 --> 02:39:16.589]  Have the globalists not walked right into the trap here?
[02:39:18.390 --> 02:39:19.330]  Yes, entirely.
[02:39:19.851 --> 02:39:22.031]  I mean, Trump is very good at turning this around.
[02:39:22.131 --> 02:39:29.214]  And, you know, the other thing that QAnon last night was really applauding was the appointment of this John Huber.
[02:39:30.188 --> 02:39:31.728]  We're good to go.
[02:39:58.994 --> 02:40:05.958]  And the mission is going to be to investigate the Department of Justice and the FISA Warren process.
[02:40:06.458 --> 02:40:14.842]  And I think it's going to mean that people like even Comey had better lawyer up and better recognized on this tour.
[02:40:15.382 --> 02:40:18.864]  He was either lying to Congress when he said the fusion GPS
[02:40:19.464 --> 02:40:20.585]  We're good to go.
[02:40:42.148 --> 02:40:52.916]  But the crazy thing is Mueller is now looking at the UAE, Saudi Arabia, looking at England, looking at all this stuff that has nothing to do with his purview of looking into Russia.
[02:40:52.936 --> 02:40:53.876]  There's nothing there.
[02:40:54.397 --> 02:40:58.119]  So how can he then do a dragnet over the entire planet?
[02:40:58.139 --> 02:41:01.722]  Because we know during any election there's outside groups that are going to pump money in.
[02:41:02.182 --> 02:41:04.864]  The Clintons, it was hundreds of times what Trump ever did.
[02:41:04.884 --> 02:41:08.447]  But they're going to find something in a presidential campaign, not that Trump even did it.
[02:41:08.807 --> 02:41:11.589]  How can Mueller just have the biggest dragnet in history?
[02:41:12.563 --> 02:41:15.165]  Well, Kinnon says basically Mueller's out of gas.
[02:41:15.925 --> 02:41:17.746]  And I've been saying this repeatedly.
[02:41:17.806 --> 02:41:24.771]  I mean, first of all, the only indictment against Russians are these 13 wacky Russians that posted some social media.
[02:41:25.551 --> 02:41:29.974]  Justice says they did not impact the election and Trump and his campaign.
[02:41:30.054 --> 02:41:32.055]  And they admit that over 80% of their activity was pro-Hillary.
[02:41:32.075 --> 02:41:32.996]  They were just mercenaries.
[02:41:33.663 --> 02:41:54.878]  Precisely, and what Mueller's got to worry about, and I think this, and also Rosenstein, is the cover-up they did on the uranium bribery scheme that, you know, the Russians bribing in the uranium industry, the whistleblower William Campbell... Sure, folks know that's all coming out, so obviously Mueller's desperate.
[02:41:55.859 --> 02:41:56.740]  And Mueller is desperate.
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:00.042]  I think the, you know, picking up Ted Malek
[02:42:00.788 --> 02:42:02.490]  And by the way, we broke all of that.
[02:42:18.163 --> 02:42:21.305]  Three days before the media had reported it and they gave us no credit.
[02:42:21.765 --> 02:42:25.428]  I mean, they admitted that you were the guy that broke it, but then didn't even say it was Infowars.com.
[02:42:25.708 --> 02:42:26.608]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[02:42:26.628 --> 02:42:27.929]  We'll talk to you again in the next few days.
[02:42:27.969 --> 02:42:28.470]  God bless.
[02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:29.570]  We're going to break.
[02:42:29.851 --> 02:42:30.271]  Thank you.
[02:42:30.311 --> 02:42:31.171]  Amazing things happening.
[02:42:31.692 --> 02:42:38.556]  A bunch of the videos we shot that were just little short clips of the Ted Nugent interview got a million views, a half million views, two million views.
[02:42:39.137 --> 02:42:43.920]  One of them has a million, 100,000 views, and that's how Ted Nugent will put it on screen for folks.
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:46.841]  Ted Nugent proves a shotgun is deadlier than an AR-15.
[02:42:47.862 --> 02:42:53.552]  But we want the big interview itself to get millions of views, and that's Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview.
[02:42:53.913 --> 02:42:56.337]  It's posted in full at InfoWars.com.
[02:42:56.377 --> 02:43:00.905]  We're gonna air an excerpt of it straight ahead, but please, email it out, make it go viral.
[02:43:02.529 --> 02:43:11.558]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:11.618 --> 02:43:19.865]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:20.026 --> 02:43:24.710]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:24.890 --> 02:43:31.614]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:31.695 --> 02:43:38.779]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:38.859 --> 02:43:45.744]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:45.904 --> 02:43:50.247]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:50.387 --> 02:43:53.609]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:53.769 --> 02:43:59.904]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:44:00.065 --> 02:44:01.749]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:03.732 --> 02:44:08.114]  William Benning joins us to go over this with us right now.
[02:44:08.194 --> 02:44:19.140]  But again, there's the amazing cover sheet by the White House lawyer for the president saying we're ready to release more and to work with Congress to expose the full extent.
[02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:20.901]  This is just the beginning.
[02:44:20.961 --> 02:44:24.583]  So, Mr. Benning, you had said last Tuesday you hope this was just the beginning.
[02:44:25.383 --> 02:44:40.988]  And that you have been told that this larger memo investigation by the FISA court was one of the prime areas tying in and a nexus point of a third party, the judicial branch, now documenting what the executive and the legislative have found.
[02:44:43.119 --> 02:45:04.413]  That's right and I think the more and more they go into it they're gonna find that the NSA is involved in this and that they need to look at what which names of people were unmasked through the NSA and which ones were targeted through their collection system and what what data they were using internally in the FBI and how they were using that data.
[02:45:05.197 --> 02:45:12.404]  That's really where criminality comes in, where you use these agencies against innocent or against U.S.
[02:45:12.444 --> 02:45:14.226]  citizens with no probable cause.
[02:45:15.127 --> 02:45:18.710]  That's a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment, and they shouldn't have been doing that anyway.
[02:45:18.770 --> 02:45:19.331]  They know that.
[02:45:19.711 --> 02:45:21.533]  That's why they're trying to keep everything so secret.
[02:45:21.633 --> 02:45:27.479]  The first place I'd start is to go after the sworn affidavit that the FBI had to submit to the FISA court to get that warrant.
[02:45:28.445 --> 02:45:37.034]  That, of course, according to the memo, seemed to focus on the dossier, the Steele dossier, and that that was a false basis to begin with, and they knew that.
[02:45:37.455 --> 02:45:41.059]  And they didn't even talk about the DNC paying to have that done.
[02:45:41.519 --> 02:45:46.685]  So this is paid propaganda used to get a warrant in the FISA court to go after other people in another campaign.
[02:45:47.706 --> 02:45:49.268]  And then it means you have to go into the
[02:45:49.868 --> 02:45:57.794]  And into the unmasking by the White House of people who were in the Trump campaign to find out who they were targeting and what data they were getting and how they were using it.
[02:45:57.834 --> 02:45:58.915]  This is really a mess.
[02:45:59.295 --> 02:46:05.759]  I mean, it gets into the total subversion and sedition, basically, and treason against this country.
[02:46:05.879 --> 02:46:07.320]  I think we're in the... this is the break.
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:15.286]  And I think this break now is opening up the real rottenness in our government in Washington and in the agencies that make it up.
[02:46:16.248 --> 02:46:19.291]  And so this is where, this is where we really have to get to it.
[02:46:19.351 --> 02:46:21.553]  And it goes beyond like the FBI is the front.
[02:46:21.953 --> 02:46:26.337]  They take the flak from everybody because they figure they'll still survive because we need the FBI.
[02:46:26.977 --> 02:46:42.590]  But behind them are the supporting agencies like NSA and NCIA and others who are actually helping them do and achieve what they want to do as a collective group of, I call them the Praetorian Guard, who will determine what our government does.
[02:46:43.230 --> 02:46:45.711]  And so that's why they think they have so much power.
[02:46:45.772 --> 02:47:00.019]  Now we have to shine the light on and show them out for what they've been doing and hold those people who did it in those agencies accountable and make sure we carry through all the law and apply all the law equally to all of them.
[02:47:06.102 --> 02:47:08.704]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.926 --> 02:47:20.846]  I love it.
[02:47:21.487 --> 02:47:23.267]  I love it!
[02:47:23.287 --> 02:47:27.029]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[02:47:27.609 --> 02:47:30.870]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[02:47:32.651 --> 02:47:36.532]  And the disease hates us, that's why it's after us more than anybody except Trump.
[02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:39.193]  I gotta tell ya, I am honored.
[02:47:40.114 --> 02:47:40.994]  I am really honored.
[02:47:42.549 --> 02:47:48.253]  I get mad at myself if we don't fight hard enough or drop the ball sometimes, but it always turns into something good as our hearts are in the right place.
[02:47:48.594 --> 02:47:50.915]  I want to air just the first few minutes of the Ted Nugent piece.
[02:47:50.955 --> 02:47:51.696]  It's so powerful.
[02:47:53.197 --> 02:47:54.758]  Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview.
[02:47:54.778 --> 02:47:56.259]  Infowars.com.
[02:47:56.619 --> 02:47:58.201]  I was just looking up during the last few breaks.
[02:47:58.261 --> 02:48:02.444]  Just the little clips of the interview we put out have more than 15 million views on YouTube alone.
[02:48:03.953 --> 02:48:09.516]  But of course the big hour-and-a-half awesome documentary will probably get like 500,000 unless you get it out to everybody.
[02:48:09.997 --> 02:48:11.617]  It's a weapon in the fight for the Second Amendment.
[02:48:12.318 --> 02:48:12.978]  But look at this!
[02:48:13.138 --> 02:48:30.388]  I was looking at Google during the break to see what they're up against and you know to see how they're responding to us exposing that the fact that they're anti-Easter anti-Christian and they've got up here John Harrison a clockmaker
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:33.240]  Okay, great.
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:35.101]  So, they celebrate a clockmaker.
[02:48:35.141 --> 02:48:36.942]  They usually celebrate communists or whatever.
[02:48:39.223 --> 02:48:42.685]  And they're doodle, but they wouldn't promote any Christian holidays.
[02:48:44.205 --> 02:48:45.226]  Like Easter or Christmas.
[02:48:46.857 --> 02:48:49.538]  And it just goes on and on from there, just like Apple.
[02:48:49.618 --> 02:48:52.059]  I mean, these people are anti-Christian for no reason!
[02:48:52.699 --> 02:48:53.780]  It's the Christian cultures!
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:49:03.224]  You'll have one African tribe that's Christian, and they'll have literally 500 times the wealth of the animist tribe across the river, who are the exact same genetic group, but...
[02:49:04.417 --> 02:49:05.637]  are shrinking each other's heads.
[02:49:06.258 --> 02:49:10.799]  Christianity, if really practiced according to the Bible, is what built civilization.
[02:49:11.119 --> 02:49:14.420]  Even if you don't believe in God, it's like, why is the left against it?
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:17.942]  Because the left wants the globalist to be God, and it stands in the way.
[02:49:17.982 --> 02:49:18.842]  They love Christmas.
[02:49:18.882 --> 02:49:20.343]  Google refuses to recognize Easter.
[02:49:20.683 --> 02:49:21.503]  Alright, enough said of that.
[02:49:23.168 --> 02:49:24.149]  Paul Watts is coming up.
[02:49:24.209 --> 02:49:30.898]  I'll introduce him with a critical announcement on the latest Democrat Party sloppy false lawsuit filed against us.
[02:49:30.938 --> 02:49:32.300]  So that's coming up right now.
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:36.526]  Here's a little bit of Ted Nugent and the intro to Firestorm.
[02:49:44.307 --> 02:49:45.827]  True Americana, baby.
[02:49:46.108 --> 02:49:51.830]  This song, Ted Nugent's fight for the Second Amendment and our other rights, and the InfoWar.
[02:49:51.971 --> 02:49:53.691]  Match made in heaven.
[02:49:53.791 --> 02:49:54.872]  Here we come now!
[02:49:55.012 --> 02:50:05.618]  Dogs are running, feisty is our lifestyle.
[02:50:06.338 --> 02:50:09.640]  Come on, follow me.
[02:50:13.234 --> 02:50:16.856]  We're at Ted Nugent's amazing Texas ranch, and I feel like I'm following the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole.
[02:50:16.916 --> 02:50:18.256]  There he is right up ahead of us.
[02:50:18.356 --> 02:50:19.277]  It's good to be in America.
[02:50:19.297 --> 02:50:20.197]  It's good to be in Texas.
[02:50:20.217 --> 02:50:24.059]  It's good to have the Second Amendment, even though these bastards are trying to steal our nat birthright.
[02:50:24.119 --> 02:50:24.679]  We're gonna win.
[02:50:24.699 --> 02:50:25.219]  We're gonna stand up.
[02:50:25.239 --> 02:50:26.119]  They're not gonna stop us.
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:27.620]  Thanks to folks like Ted Nugent and all of you out there.
[02:50:33.533 --> 02:50:37.494]  We have the right to keep and bear arms, not just the king, the people.
[02:50:37.554 --> 02:50:39.914]  We the people have the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:50:39.994 --> 02:50:42.695]  If you try to take it away from us, we'll shoot you!
[02:50:42.735 --> 02:50:47.256]  I'm kind of hesitant to even share this information, but once again, information is knowledge.
[02:50:47.396 --> 02:50:48.396]  Knowledge is power.
[02:50:48.696 --> 02:50:50.917]  Power is the capability of correcting wrong.
[02:50:50.937 --> 02:50:55.758]  I'm usually dead on with a bow, but I'm actually sweating because Ted Nugent's watching.
[02:50:57.162 --> 02:50:58.223]  My name is Ted Nugent.
[02:50:58.323 --> 02:51:00.845]  I'm entering my 70th rock and roll year of the American dream.
[02:51:00.865 --> 02:51:02.627]  My 70th hunting season.
[02:51:02.667 --> 02:51:04.749]  I got 14 grandkids and 7 wonderful kids.
[02:51:04.769 --> 02:51:06.750]  The most beautiful, dangerous wife in the world.
[02:51:06.790 --> 02:51:08.932]  The greatest hunting dogs in the world.
[02:51:09.052 --> 02:51:12.815]  I have machine guns and everything I want in life.
[02:51:13.036 --> 02:51:14.337]  The best sounding band.
[02:51:14.357 --> 02:51:17.499]  The best grinding rhythm and blues rock and roll band in the world.
[02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:22.784]  We have reached critical mass and I'm loving every greasy, gory rhythm and blues Motown minute of it.
[02:51:22.804 --> 02:51:22.944]  Yeah!
[02:51:24.445 --> 02:51:26.646]  The people who hate me are hated because I'm so happy!
[02:51:27.207 --> 02:51:32.849]  Alright folks, inside Ted Nugent's awesome ranch with his great wife and family, this is America.
[02:51:33.050 --> 02:51:33.990]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:51:34.110 --> 02:51:41.954]  Everybody want coffee?
[02:51:42.354 --> 02:51:43.275]  Sure, we'd love some.
[02:51:43.295 --> 02:51:45.516]  Alright, here's some good f***ing Nugent Java.
[02:51:45.736 --> 02:51:50.658]  And I'm not kidding, this isn't Tom Petty coffee.
[02:51:50.718 --> 02:51:53.480]  My coffee's the only coffee that's ballistically coefficient.
[02:51:54.716 --> 02:52:00.599]  I like a good cup of Joe, man.
[02:52:00.779 --> 02:52:05.342]  News coffee, brought to you by Stay On Point.
[02:52:05.362 --> 02:52:06.882]  Now take a slug of that, Jones.
[02:52:06.982 --> 02:52:07.963]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:07.983 --> 02:52:08.823]  Some serious stuff.
[02:52:08.843 --> 02:52:10.684]  Starboy can kiss my dead dogs without a nut.
[02:52:13.217 --> 02:52:13.958]  And here's the boss.
[02:52:14.018 --> 02:52:14.718]  Hey, how are you?
[02:52:14.738 --> 02:52:16.159]  Hey, it's awesome to meet you.
[02:52:16.179 --> 02:52:18.801]  Talked to you before on the phone, but it's good to see you in person.
[02:52:18.861 --> 02:52:19.041]  Yeah!
[02:52:19.821 --> 02:52:21.342]  Thanks for having us at your home.
[02:52:21.382 --> 02:52:22.443]  Yeah, it's nice to be here.
[02:52:22.483 --> 02:52:23.163]  Thank you.
[02:52:23.243 --> 02:52:25.005]  Glad to finally meet you.
[02:52:25.285 --> 02:52:25.785]  Boys, you're welcome.
[02:52:25.825 --> 02:52:28.527]  You're in a hospitable environment here.
[02:52:28.847 --> 02:52:30.308]  And don't give me this polite bull****.
[02:52:30.388 --> 02:52:32.169]  Once I let you on my ranch, you're my friends.
[02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:34.831]  And as friendly as I am,
[02:52:36.641 --> 02:52:37.742]  I'm prepared to kill each other.
[02:52:37.802 --> 02:52:53.297]  I think the most important thing we can say, if I do say so myself, and I just happen to know what that most important thing is, before we get into the disaster that surrounds us, the dishonesty, the political... We should celebrate the good stuff.
[02:52:54.277 --> 02:53:06.323]  There are so many great Americans out there that get up early and bust their ass and live by the truth, logic, and common sense that we celebrate and promote.
[02:53:07.064 --> 02:53:09.665]  It is alive and well across this country.
[02:53:09.685 --> 02:53:10.286]  And here's to them!
[02:53:11.006 --> 02:53:22.252]  At the feed mill, at the hardware store, at the grocery store, at the coffee shop, at the schools, at the churches, everywhere I go, it's like
[02:53:23.012 --> 02:53:24.473]  Truth, logic, and common sense.
[02:53:24.973 --> 02:53:32.916]  Second Amendment absolutists, earning your own way, saving for a rainy day, giving to the needy instead of expecting Uncle Sam to take care of them.
[02:53:33.256 --> 02:53:35.617]  So what you and I live by is not rare.
[02:53:36.137 --> 02:53:39.818]  It is approaching ubiquity across this country.
[02:53:39.858 --> 02:53:43.679]  And they're trying to steal it because they're desperate and know that they've lost the culture war.
[02:53:43.739 --> 02:53:44.500]  They really have.
[02:53:44.660 --> 02:53:47.461]  And academia, media,
[02:53:49.617 --> 02:53:51.218]  The government itself in Hollywood.
[02:53:52.279 --> 02:54:08.172]  In my 70 years of clean and sober radar-ing my world around me, I watched the dumbing down of America manifest itself in all things liberal, democrat, rhino, anti-constitutional infringement, oath violation that is running amok.
[02:54:08.232 --> 02:54:09.953]  But in spite of that,
[02:54:11.884 --> 02:54:13.566]  I'm living the American dream every day.
[02:54:13.586 --> 02:54:20.331]  I hunt, I fish, I shoot, I make music, I tour, I do charity work, I hang with working hard, playing hard Americans.
[02:54:20.592 --> 02:54:24.975]  So the positive spirit is still soaring across this country.
[02:54:25.075 --> 02:54:32.102]  I gotta tell you, I know you did thousands of interviews during the election and everybody gets credit, but if you hadn't worked your ass off so hard, I don't know if Trump would have gotten in.
[02:54:32.282 --> 02:54:34.023]  I don't remember sleeping in 2016.
[02:54:34.063 --> 02:54:36.185]  What I did is I focused on
[02:54:38.987 --> 02:54:42.908]  They called Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, the reliably blue states.
[02:54:42.968 --> 02:54:43.988]  Every time they reported.
[02:54:44.248 --> 02:54:45.989]  What a nasty thing to say.
[02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:49.430]  The reliably blue states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.
[02:54:49.450 --> 02:54:51.390]  So I focused my attention on those three states.
[02:54:51.890 --> 02:54:59.613]  And I wallpapered and carpet bombed the media, scolding the conservatives, the licensed hunters of those states.
[02:54:59.633 --> 02:54:59.893]  800,000 per state.
[02:55:01.853 --> 02:55:04.535]  And I scolded them that they didn't vote for McCain and Romney.
[02:55:04.815 --> 02:55:06.136]  You can't blame them, really.
[02:55:06.776 --> 02:55:10.619]  Because McCain and Romney didn't represent anything that we believe in.
[02:55:11.701 --> 02:55:14.923]  But by not voting for McCain and Romney, they gave it to Barack Obama.
[02:55:15.043 --> 02:55:16.064]  And they get all the judges.
[02:55:16.144 --> 02:55:18.065]  Yeah, it went really nuts on them.
[02:55:18.225 --> 02:55:23.428]  And I didn't do it alone, but that was the driving force in those reliably blue hell zones.
[02:55:23.728 --> 02:55:25.449]  Because those states are not reliably blue.
[02:55:25.469 --> 02:55:27.691]  In fact, it's important to talk about the positive.
[02:55:28.231 --> 02:55:31.793]  You look at our map of America, political map, and it's just red as can be.
[02:55:32.233 --> 02:55:38.497]  Except for the little blue high-crime smudges of liberal Democrat insanity.
[02:55:38.737 --> 02:55:40.198]  Where liberal Democrats have
[02:55:41.261 --> 02:55:52.496]  Literally brainwashed people to think that they don't have to earn their own way and that self-defense is not desirable and unarmed helplessness and gun-free zones will somehow keep us safe.
[02:55:52.516 --> 02:55:56.922]  And if you think about it, those little cancer spots across the red-blooded map
[02:55:57.923 --> 02:55:59.684]  Know that their time is running out.
[02:55:59.744 --> 02:56:00.505]  They admit that.
[02:56:00.965 --> 02:56:06.228]  My favorite thing is not that you and I and everybody I know agree with logic, truth, and common sense.
[02:56:06.428 --> 02:56:15.453]  My favorite thing is watching liberals and Democrats attempt to make their points on television and not knowing how stupid they look.
[02:56:15.753 --> 02:56:18.214]  They are the masters of shooting themselves in the foot.
[02:56:18.454 --> 02:56:24.838]  So if you and I were to have a date with God, which by the way I think we do, and we said, God could you design
[02:56:25.938 --> 02:56:26.578]  Our foil.
[02:56:26.739 --> 02:56:39.904]  Could you design someone who could actually look so obnoxious and rude and dishonest and unkempt to counter what we believe in?
[02:56:40.424 --> 02:56:41.205]  He'd go, I already did.
[02:56:41.265 --> 02:56:41.905]  Name me Michael Moore.
[02:56:42.345 --> 02:56:42.605]  Exactly.
[02:56:42.625 --> 02:56:43.285]  Or Nancy Pelosi.
[02:56:43.325 --> 02:56:43.966]  Or Hillary Clinton.
[02:56:44.066 --> 02:56:44.826]  Or Hillary Clinton.
[02:56:44.886 --> 02:56:45.586]  Or Barack Obama.
[02:56:45.606 --> 02:56:46.227]  Or Eric Holder.
[02:56:46.247 --> 02:56:47.087]  Or Wendell Lynch.
[02:56:47.327 --> 02:56:58.331]  My favorite is, I think the Democrats, when they put forth the Pelosi's and the Boxer's and especially the Maxine Waters and the Sheila Jackson-Lee's, that struggle to form syllables.
[02:56:59.092 --> 02:57:06.915]  I couldn't have gone to central casting and go, could you create a big dirt bag to represent the... Or the guy from Georgia that thinks Iowans float.
[02:57:06.935 --> 02:57:07.635]  Yeah, perfect.
[02:57:07.735 --> 02:57:08.275]  Exactly.
[02:57:08.535 --> 02:57:09.196]  Let him talk.
[02:57:09.456 --> 02:57:10.096]  Give him the microphone.
[02:57:10.656 --> 02:57:23.566]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[02:57:23.907 --> 02:57:28.770]  Sacred as the Second Amendment is, the First Amendment is not important because we can say what we want.
[02:57:29.151 --> 02:57:34.215]  It's because idiots can say what they want so the rest of us will go, gosh, that's an idiot.
[02:57:34.395 --> 02:57:36.076]  So I think we're in a good place right now.
[02:57:36.757 --> 02:57:37.897]  And I think
[02:57:38.798 --> 02:57:43.259]  The fact that the left is so brain dead and comfortably numb.
[02:57:43.279 --> 02:57:45.460]  We're going to come back with more of this, the full interviews on InfoWars.
[02:57:46.020 --> 02:57:48.281]  It's a perfect video, except I'm in the shot too much.
[02:57:48.301 --> 02:57:50.041]  I kept telling him, stop putting me in the shot.
[02:57:50.181 --> 02:57:51.602]  God, that pumpkin head.
[02:57:52.342 --> 02:57:58.424]  InfoWars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[02:57:58.644 --> 02:58:02.407]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were.
[02:58:02.467 --> 02:58:04.968]  What were most popular, what were best, what people liked.
[02:58:05.069 --> 02:58:06.890]  And we made it even stronger.
[02:58:07.050 --> 02:58:11.773]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[02:58:12.113 --> 02:58:14.095]  We only have a hundred and fifty percent.
[02:58:14.415 --> 02:58:15.556]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[02:58:15.856 --> 02:58:18.138]  Well now it's 50% off.
[02:58:18.678 --> 02:58:27.085]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[02:58:27.105 --> 02:58:28.626]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[02:58:28.926 --> 02:58:30.307]  But the two go together.
[02:58:30.427 --> 02:58:32.089]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[02:58:32.449 --> 02:58:36.812]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[02:58:37.853 --> 02:58:41.315]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[02:58:41.335 --> 02:58:47.239]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:58:47.279 --> 02:58:50.301]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[02:58:50.341 --> 02:58:50.922]  It's very simple.
[02:59:08.053 --> 02:59:08.974]  We went out and looked.
[02:59:09.014 --> 02:59:09.574]  What is the top?
[02:59:09.654 --> 02:59:10.195]  What is the best?
[02:59:10.555 --> 02:59:11.776]  We'll just put even more product in.
[02:59:11.796 --> 02:59:12.416]  We'll make it better.
[02:59:12.496 --> 02:59:14.938]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it.
[02:59:14.978 --> 02:59:15.358]  Sell it for $60.
[02:59:16.199 --> 02:59:18.260]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:21.022]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:59:21.162 --> 02:59:24.065]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[02:59:26.286 --> 02:59:28.347]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[02:59:28.647 --> 02:59:32.469]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the globals, the rest of it.
[02:59:32.489 --> 02:59:35.911]  But, I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[02:59:36.371 --> 02:59:39.272]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[02:59:39.532 --> 02:59:42.934]  And I want people that haven't tried, Brain Force, to try it and find out why.
[02:59:43.174 --> 02:59:45.475]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[02:59:45.775 --> 02:59:46.456]  It's amazing.
[02:59:46.776 --> 02:59:49.197]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:54.440 --> 03:00:00.405]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:01.506 --> 03:00:12.035]  Man, I love this Van Halen song!
[03:00:12.095 --> 03:00:20.722]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:25.029 --> 03:00:25.992]  Love the guitar right here.
[03:00:28.419 --> 03:00:29.602]  But still, technique is better.
[03:00:29.822 --> 03:00:30.163]  Sorry.
[03:00:30.705 --> 03:00:31.367]  Bring it up for a minute.
[03:00:35.774 --> 03:00:38.215]  All right, let's go back to a little bit more of the Ted News interview.
[03:00:38.255 --> 03:00:38.975]  It's on Infowars.com.
[03:00:39.035 --> 03:00:41.055]  We're coming back with Paul.
[03:00:41.496 --> 03:00:46.817]  I've had the New York Times, the Washington Post, all these fake news organizations calling a statement on their latest lawsuit against me.
[03:00:47.137 --> 03:00:47.757]  Let's follow your stay.
[03:00:47.777 --> 03:00:48.857]  I'll give you that statement briefly.
[03:00:48.877 --> 03:00:56.019]  On the other side of the break, I'm not going to call you guys, because I've sat there and tested out where I call like 10 of them, and they don't quote you a bit.
[03:00:56.059 --> 03:00:58.180]  They just act like they've talked to you.
[03:00:59.158 --> 03:01:03.723]  They just, because I always counter them properly, so they don't actually put the quotes in there.
[03:01:03.884 --> 03:01:07.728]  But I'll give them their statement, coming up here in just a few minutes.
[03:01:07.788 --> 03:01:12.554]  And Paul Watson, from Her Botanic Majesties, England, will be joining us.
[03:01:12.574 --> 03:01:19.362]  But let's get a little bit more of Ted Nugent and the special report on Infowars.com, Firestorm, the Ted Nugent interview.
[03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:24.204]  The First Amendment is not important because we can say what we want.
[03:01:24.564 --> 03:01:29.611]  It's because idiots can say what they want, so the rest of us go, gosh, that's an idiot.
[03:01:29.791 --> 03:01:31.473]  So I think we're in a good place right now.
[03:01:32.154 --> 03:01:36.019]  And I think the fact that the left is so
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:44.642]  brain-dead and comfortably numb with political correctness and fake news and dishonesty, that they're doing a better job than we are.
[03:01:44.762 --> 03:01:46.382]  No, I agree.
[03:01:46.422 --> 03:01:57.205]  Since we're here getting the Second Amendment, we're seeing right now the biggest purge online of conservative sites, veteran sites, gun sites, shooting clubs, Christian sites.
[03:01:57.285 --> 03:01:58.625]  I've never seen such a purge.
[03:01:58.746 --> 03:02:00.066]  Oh, I've been thrown off
[03:02:00.926 --> 03:02:07.868]  I won't mention any names now in hopes that the negotiations can continue and move forward on an honest level.
[03:02:08.208 --> 03:02:14.989]  But I have been thrown out by the biggest promoters in the world because I'm on the board of the NRA.
[03:02:15.229 --> 03:02:21.971]  And I promise you, if I was recently arrested for heroin distribution, they would have not thrown me off.
[03:02:22.071 --> 03:02:22.511]  Exactly.
[03:02:23.451 --> 03:02:35.018]  But because I'm on the board of the Family Grassroots Organization of the National Rifle Association that stands for self-defense, I've been thrown off tens of millions of dollars in revenue.
[03:02:35.158 --> 03:02:40.762]  Look at all the claims that I'm a child molester, a draft dodger, that I diss the Native Americans.
[03:02:41.502 --> 03:02:42.463]  It's all lies!
[03:02:42.563 --> 03:02:42.863]  Oh, I know.
[03:02:42.883 --> 03:02:46.185]  What nasty things, especially my relation with the Native Americans.
[03:02:46.565 --> 03:02:52.009]  I have been invited to almost every Native American tribe to teach their children
[03:02:53.132 --> 03:03:06.970]  The native lifestyle of clean and sober, hands-on conservation, self-sufficiency, hunting, fishing, outdoor conservation, shared sweat lodges with their spiritual leaders since the 60s.
[03:03:07.250 --> 03:03:07.931]  I have been given
[03:03:08.872 --> 03:03:22.357]  felonious eagle feather war bonnets by the elders of numerous tribes because I, in my song Great White Buffalo, and in my promotion of conservation, especially bow hunting, they feel a kinship, a blood brotherhood there with me.
[03:03:22.557 --> 03:03:30.300]  So meanwhile, the Native Americans and I are spiritual blood brothers, so the Huffington Post claims that I called him unclean vermin.
[03:03:32.802 --> 03:03:35.043]  And then some people actually fell for it.
[03:03:35.103 --> 03:03:41.826]  So, you can see that as I say these things, as nasty and horrific and dishonest as they are, you notice I'm still smiling.
[03:03:42.726 --> 03:03:44.967]  It is a panicked purge, because I agree with you.
[03:03:44.987 --> 03:03:47.768]  They know that culturally they've lost the soul of America.
[03:03:47.788 --> 03:03:51.570]  I mean, you go to the Rolling Stone articles attacking you and I this week.
[03:03:51.630 --> 03:03:52.690]  It's hysterical!
[03:03:52.730 --> 03:03:54.051]  They'll get one or two comments.
[03:03:54.431 --> 03:03:57.052]  Your site has thousands per story, so does mine, and 50 times the traffic.
[03:03:57.092 --> 03:03:57.832]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:03:58.032 --> 03:03:58.353]  You're right.
[03:03:58.553 --> 03:03:59.893]  They have had a cardiac arrest.
[03:04:00.193 --> 03:04:01.134]  They're falling apart.
[03:04:02.154 --> 03:04:04.115]  I don't want to underestimate their counteroffensive.
[03:04:04.135 --> 03:04:04.735]  No, no, we don't.
[03:04:04.755 --> 03:04:06.996]  It doesn't mean that we get complacent by any stretch of the imagination.
[03:04:07.036 --> 03:04:08.817]  All right, folks, the full interview is up there.
[03:04:09.097 --> 03:04:12.259]  But notice the same lies we've dealt with, the same lies he's dealt with.
[03:04:12.439 --> 03:04:15.540]  Calling us Nazis, calling us all this doesn't work anymore.
[03:04:15.980 --> 03:04:17.201]  So now it's lawsuits.
[03:04:18.261 --> 03:04:23.744]  And the lawsuits are defamation because you can defame in court in a court document.
[03:04:24.264 --> 03:04:26.025]  But that's then why the suits get thrown out.
[03:04:26.505 --> 03:04:27.285]  But they don't care.
[03:04:27.725 --> 03:04:31.387]  The left just wants to get the attention every time they file a fake lawsuit.
[03:04:32.992 --> 03:04:37.553]  And like a simulated victory, like they keep calling Trump a white supremacist or a rapist.
[03:04:37.593 --> 03:04:38.293]  None of it's true.
[03:04:38.813 --> 03:04:40.713]  They just think if they say it enough, you'll believe it.
[03:04:40.793 --> 03:04:43.974]  And their own followers do believe it because they're losers, but not us.
[03:04:44.054 --> 03:04:48.055]  So, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The L.A.
[03:04:48.075 --> 03:04:48.335]  Times.
[03:04:48.815 --> 03:04:52.075]  I mean, there's hundreds of them calling, wanting me to give them a quote on this new lawsuit.
[03:04:52.535 --> 03:04:59.416]  So I will give you the quote right now, on the other side, and then that'll be it.
[03:05:00.977 --> 03:05:02.077]  You desperate criminals.
[03:05:03.771 --> 03:05:06.973]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:05:07.434 --> 03:05:08.735]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:05:09.215 --> 03:05:20.663]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:05:21.443 --> 03:05:30.366]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:05:30.766 --> 03:05:41.469]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:05:41.989 --> 03:05:44.310]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:05:44.650 --> 03:05:45.971]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:05:46.391 --> 03:05:55.994]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:05:56.094 --> 03:05:58.235]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:05:58.775 --> 03:06:03.677]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[03:06:05.238 --> 03:06:06.598]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:06:07.799 --> 03:06:10.420]  Broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[03:06:12.688 --> 03:06:18.710]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[03:06:18.730 --> 03:06:21.791]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:06:21.831 --> 03:06:25.132]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[03:06:26.032 --> 03:06:28.453]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[03:06:32.716 --> 03:06:43.403]  Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Watson's about to take over from the United Kingdom with huge breaking news, but I've had Washington Post, the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, LA Times, you name it, they've all called wanting a comment.
[03:06:44.263 --> 03:06:53.710]  And I noticed that the Daily Beast and all the rest of them sent a comment yesterday while I was on air, five minutes after they filed their stories.
[03:06:54.170 --> 03:06:55.391]  They were obviously written weeks ago.
[03:06:58.459 --> 03:07:03.285]  And the headline is, from the Daily Beast, falsely accused Parkland shooter sues Alex Jones.
[03:07:03.706 --> 03:07:04.907]  Info wars for defamation.
[03:07:06.349 --> 03:07:07.591]  Never said the guy's name.
[03:07:08.052 --> 03:07:12.938]  Picked up what thousands of other news outlets did, saying this reportedly could be Ted Cruz.
[03:07:12.978 --> 03:07:16.222]  We said some sites are saying this is Ted Cruz.
[03:07:17.461 --> 03:07:20.823]  See, I can't even, I'm teleprompter-free, but then that causes derailments here occasionally.
[03:07:21.704 --> 03:07:22.404]  Nicholas Cruz.
[03:07:23.185 --> 03:07:25.747]  Now Ted Cruz will shoot me, but it's not intentional.
[03:07:26.207 --> 03:07:27.028]  It's just hilarious.
[03:07:28.208 --> 03:07:30.530]  And that's what happens when you're teleprompter-free, folks.
[03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:31.651]  You'll get names wrong and things.
[03:07:32.191 --> 03:07:35.133]  That's why Paul Watson does hours of preparation before he goes live on air.
[03:07:35.834 --> 03:07:37.155]  No, but seriously, let me start back over.
[03:07:40.217 --> 03:07:42.779]  I have been asked by the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[03:07:43.737 --> 03:07:59.484]  The LA Times, hundreds of publications have called yesterday and today asking for comments on the latest lawsuit that was filed yesterday dealing with Nicholas Cruz, the reported shooter in the Parkland massacre from Valentine's Day in February of 2018.
[03:07:59.524 --> 03:08:00.164]  And the suit deals with
[03:08:09.444 --> 03:08:18.734]  Reddit and Facebook and Twitter and 4chan, everybody's saying this is on the Facebook, this is on the Twitter, this is Nicholas Cruz, reportedly.
[03:08:19.034 --> 03:08:22.978]  And we said this is Nicholas Cruz, allegedly.
[03:08:23.639 --> 03:08:27.823]  We didn't even say the name of the guy that it was, but it was a gentleman wearing a hammer and sickle shirt.
[03:08:30.054 --> 03:08:35.896]  And so that night we figured out that no, here's the photo of Nick Cruz, he's a different person.
[03:08:35.956 --> 03:08:40.538]  We removed the photo and updated the site like the New York Times does, CNN, you name it.
[03:08:41.198 --> 03:08:42.919]  They're updating all the time, changing headlines.
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:52.442]  And then we retracted it as well within the 30-day limit under Texas statutory law to basically, if they did file a lawsuit, it would get thrown out.
[03:08:53.700 --> 03:09:04.874]  That didn't matter because, as my lawyers have pointed out, it's all a PR stunt where they say all these false things about us in the lawsuit that we haven't done or we haven't said, just like in the other lawsuits.
[03:09:05.868 --> 03:09:11.033]  That my lawyers aren't worried we'll actually ever win, but it doesn't matter.
[03:09:11.113 --> 03:09:16.418]  It's just designed to have Alex Jones associated with the term lawsuit, and it's really an attack on free speech.
[03:09:16.478 --> 03:09:22.604]  And a lot of top lawyers are now coming out watching this phenomenon, even lawyers that, you know, a lot of liberals support.
[03:09:23.004 --> 03:09:27.448]  Even the Daily Beast has a lawyer, you know, saying, this is lawsuits against people that filed it.
[03:09:29.170 --> 03:09:36.116]  You guys are in your filing, which is very dangerous, saying we don't like his speech, and you list all these horrible things I've supposedly done.
[03:09:36.416 --> 03:09:37.597]  Most of it's not even true.
[03:09:38.077 --> 03:09:40.660]  But in law, that's not the issue, even if it was true.
[03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:41.981]  It's what I've currently done.
[03:09:42.601 --> 03:09:46.825]  So you destroy your whole argument in that process.
[03:09:48.581 --> 03:09:59.605]  I mean, if somebody sees it all over the news that this is purported to be a photo of the shooter and we say alleged, and then we take it down and say it's a mistake, statutorily we don't have an issue.
[03:10:00.006 --> 03:10:02.767]  Just like I said Ted Cruz earlier coming in, not Nick Cruz.
[03:10:03.007 --> 03:10:04.187]  Wasn't on purpose, I corrected it.
[03:10:04.207 --> 03:10:06.208]  I'm not saying Ted Cruz at the shooting there.
[03:10:06.468 --> 03:10:07.289]  I'm teleprompter free.
[03:10:07.309 --> 03:10:09.490]  We can get a document cam shot maybe over here.
[03:10:09.630 --> 03:10:12.771]  There's Paul Watson's over here on the TV.
[03:10:15.831 --> 03:10:17.472]  There he is.
[03:10:17.532 --> 03:10:18.152]  And go over.
[03:10:18.192 --> 03:10:19.072]  There's no teleprompter.
[03:10:21.413 --> 03:10:23.714]  You've got them saying, Trump military at border clip ready.
[03:10:23.734 --> 03:10:24.574]  We're going to play that in a minute.
[03:10:25.415 --> 03:10:27.555]  And you've got the clock and you've got some phone numbers.
[03:10:28.236 --> 03:10:28.576]  That's it.
[03:10:29.376 --> 03:10:30.577]  There is no teleprompter.
[03:10:30.617 --> 03:10:37.399]  So I'll sit here and go, well, you know, we got the shooter wrong saying Ted Cruz.
[03:10:37.539 --> 03:10:39.040]  I mean, Nicholas Cruz.
[03:10:40.063 --> 03:10:42.105]  But it's not intentional to do harm.
[03:10:42.525 --> 03:10:43.926]  That's the standard of the law.
[03:10:44.146 --> 03:10:45.207]  You don't win those suits.
[03:10:45.307 --> 03:10:51.352]  But it's the harassment suits that are called slap suits that almost every state has passed laws to stop.
[03:10:52.874 --> 03:11:00.320]  And those are much bigger dollar numbers for who files them and the plaintiffs that sign on to them.
[03:11:01.607 --> 03:11:07.413]  And all the suits against us, our lawyers say, and I've checked with other councils, say no, you will win a slap back on this.
[03:11:07.634 --> 03:11:12.419]  You'll get attorney's fees and the money back, but we gotta beat the suits first, then we gotta file suit.
[03:11:13.698 --> 03:11:15.560]  And so tee up the next group here.
[03:11:16.040 --> 03:11:21.925]  And even the Daily Beast and the article, falsely accused Parkland shooter Suze Alex Jones, they published the guy's name.
[03:11:21.945 --> 03:11:22.525]  We never did it.
[03:11:22.786 --> 03:11:24.007]  No one connected to this guy.
[03:11:24.327 --> 03:11:25.388]  We removed it the day of.
[03:11:25.748 --> 03:11:26.429]  We retracted.
[03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:27.409]  They say we didn't retract.
[03:11:27.449 --> 03:11:30.432]  Well, we have the registered letter and the retraction and everything else.
[03:11:30.472 --> 03:11:32.834]  So again, it's all, it's all just not true.
[03:11:34.155 --> 03:11:38.899]  And they put in the lawsuit and the exhibits other people's websites and statements that aren't even our website.
[03:11:39.119 --> 03:11:40.200]  You can see it's not ours.
[03:11:41.451 --> 03:11:43.957]  And it's the sloppiness that's so scary.
[03:11:44.378 --> 03:11:46.022]  So you want a statement, mainstream media?
[03:11:49.226 --> 03:11:49.726]  You're dying.
[03:11:49.766 --> 03:11:50.546]  You've fallen apart.
[03:11:50.566 --> 03:11:56.068]  The New York Times is propped up by Carlos Slim, you know, the big kingpin, richest guy in Latin America.
[03:11:56.088 --> 03:12:01.409]  The Washington Post is owned by Bezos, lost $30 billion last year as the public finds out he's taxpayer-funded.
[03:12:01.869 --> 03:12:03.210]  You guys are on sinking ships.
[03:12:03.250 --> 03:12:09.551]  So, my four bearers went and fought and died and got killed and dropped bombs on Germany so we'd be free.
[03:12:09.971 --> 03:12:12.512]  I just gotta have leftists file fake lawsuits against me?
[03:12:13.012 --> 03:12:15.613]  And a few liberals try to beat me up on the street or dump coffee on my head?
[03:12:15.953 --> 03:12:16.713]  I'm doing just fine.
[03:12:17.691 --> 03:12:19.732]  We didn't defame anybody intentionally.
[03:12:19.752 --> 03:12:21.953]  That was a Thorough thought, intention to do harm.
[03:12:22.473 --> 03:12:24.434]  We corrected when we found out who the shooter was.
[03:12:25.075 --> 03:12:25.875]  We removed it.
[03:12:26.215 --> 03:12:29.017]  We followed the statute, but didn't stop them from filing.
[03:12:30.017 --> 03:12:44.845]  So, it continues here to say, Mr. White, who is a speech lawyer,
[03:12:47.588 --> 03:12:53.991]  Ken White, First Amendment litigator at Brown, White and Osborne said the suit could run afoul of Texas law.
[03:12:55.332 --> 03:13:05.016]  The core of the suit, White told the Daily Beast, the problem is that the complaint buries the core wrong in a general attack on InfoWars and Alex Jones and their fans.
[03:13:05.696 --> 03:13:07.877]  This might make for good press, but it's dangerous.
[03:13:08.718 --> 03:13:10.539]  Oh yeah, you bet, White continued.
[03:13:10.899 --> 03:13:13.440]  Texas has a very strong anti-slap suit.
[03:13:14.545 --> 03:13:32.126]  If Infowars can frame the lawsuit as being more broadly about the content of its speech in general, or about the speech of a third party commenters, where Infowars is not responsible under Section 230 of the Communications Easy Act, the plaintiff faces a real risk of anti-slap ruling.
[03:13:35.146 --> 03:13:44.228]  SLAPP, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, refers to strategic, frivolous lawsuits designed to silence particular categories of speech, like Monsanto does.
[03:13:44.968 --> 03:13:48.189]  Different states have different types of laws on the litigation.
[03:13:48.449 --> 03:13:57.111]  Governor Rick Perry signed Texas anti-SLAPP law in 2011, and it had the support of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Texas Trial Law Association, and a number of free speech advocates.
[03:13:57.831 --> 03:14:01.773]  And it goes on to say, oh, they didn't immediately respond, InfoWars.
[03:14:01.813 --> 03:14:02.873]  Yes, you did want us to.
[03:14:03.153 --> 03:14:06.415]  You wanted to act like, again, for your own legal reasons, that you talked to me.
[03:14:07.735 --> 03:14:09.436]  So there's my response, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:10.177 --> 03:14:15.959]  And you're such yellow journalists, you'll turn around and say, I accused Ted Cruz of being the shooter just because I messed the name up, Teleprompter Free.
[03:14:16.199 --> 03:14:17.360]  That's what you do, frauds.
[03:14:17.680 --> 03:14:19.741]  But I corrected it 10 seconds later.
[03:14:20.595 --> 03:14:21.576]  Just like we did this.
[03:14:22.458 --> 03:14:28.826]  So, they just hope to pile enough of these on that I'm like, I'll just care about money, I'm gonna go away.
[03:14:29.047 --> 03:14:31.330]  I will never go away until I'm dead.
[03:14:31.350 --> 03:14:33.373]  And then my work and stuff will live on.
[03:14:33.733 --> 03:14:33.853]  So...
[03:14:35.970 --> 03:14:36.370]  That's that.
[03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:41.212]  We have our correction, clarification posted before the deadline.
[03:14:41.492 --> 03:14:42.112]  You can go read it.
[03:14:42.152 --> 03:14:44.693]  We have the screenshots and the way... all of it.
[03:14:44.713 --> 03:14:46.073]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[03:14:46.553 --> 03:14:48.054]  But they say we didn't retract.
[03:14:48.114 --> 03:14:48.934]  We didn't do all that.
[03:14:49.614 --> 03:14:55.536]  So, um, my lawyers looked at it and they said, no, it's a PR stunt and they feel sorry for the plaintiff.
[03:14:57.355 --> 03:15:06.022]  I feel sorry for him when he poses for photos with a hammer and sickle shirt on because he thinks he's getting a big fat payday and all he's gonna get is justice.
[03:15:06.863 --> 03:15:07.944]  Because we have no other choice.
[03:15:08.164 --> 03:15:19.153]  I'm not a litigious person, but I gotta let people know that when you sign on to sue me and it's frivolous, you're going to have stuff come back at you.
[03:15:19.193 --> 03:15:24.637]  So, I figured that out with Shabani and I signed the non-disclosure so I can't get into it.
[03:15:26.363 --> 03:15:33.257]  That was the first domino to fall and I realized... They want to just say I settled a lawsuit.
[03:15:35.662 --> 03:15:36.765]  When, let's just say...
[03:15:39.560 --> 03:15:41.361]  The grass got greener after it for me.
[03:15:42.121 --> 03:15:54.188]  They just wanted me to say I was guilty for the tens of millions of dollars of fake advertising that could be out there, that no Muslims ever raped anybody, and no refugees ever came in, and Muslims are the sweetest people since cupcakes were invented.
[03:15:54.869 --> 03:15:55.929]  Please support the broadcast.
[03:15:56.009 --> 03:15:57.310]  Massive sales end today.
[03:15:57.630 --> 03:15:58.631]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:15:58.651 --> 03:15:59.611]  Without you, we're nothing.
[03:15:59.871 --> 03:16:00.752]  We'll be back with Paul Watson.
[03:16:11.866 --> 03:16:13.787]  Owen Troyer here for InfoWars.com.
[03:16:13.847 --> 03:16:30.871]  Now, I am at City Council today to discuss an incident that happened on December 10, 2017, where I was trying to go to a memorial march for Kate Steinle, but I was met with armed masked men that prevented me from entering and were intimidating and threatening me.
[03:16:30.891 --> 03:16:32.632]  I'm going to bring this issue to City Council.
[03:16:32.652 --> 03:16:33.692]  Let's see how they take it.
[03:16:34.431 --> 03:16:37.074]  Alright, well I'm going to start by asking the council a question.
[03:16:37.134 --> 03:16:42.839]  Given everything that's happened in the month of March with the bombings and the police officers saying, if you see anything suspicious, say something.
[03:16:43.360 --> 03:16:49.245]  I think we would all agree that masked men walking around with firearms is something suspicious.
[03:16:49.265 --> 03:16:52.609]  Now I'm going to play this video for the council to review.
[03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:57.221]  That illustrates that exact thing happening.
[03:16:57.301 --> 03:17:03.084]  Now, I am a firm believer in the First Amendment right, so an individual has the right to walk around with their face covered.
[03:17:04.024 --> 03:17:05.645]  I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment right.
[03:17:06.165 --> 03:17:10.387]  I believe in constitutional carry, so you can carry a rifle or whatever firearm you want with you.
[03:17:10.907 --> 03:17:11.288]  However,
[03:17:12.328 --> 03:17:13.069]  According to U.S.
[03:17:13.109 --> 03:17:36.610]  Code, Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 13, Subsection 241, Conspiracy Against Rights states, if two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any state, territory, commonwealth, or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured by him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised them the same, or two or
[03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:49.175]  More and more persons go in disguise or on the premises of another with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years.
[03:17:50.267 --> 03:17:58.829]  Well, on December 10th, the video you're witnessing right now, I went to a memorial march for a deceased victim of a violent crime.
[03:17:59.309 --> 03:18:08.431]  And I was met, as you can see in these pictures, by masked men with arms on their triggers of rifles, battering clubs, etc.
[03:18:08.971 --> 03:18:13.832]  Here you can see this man has his finger on the trigger, keeping me from going to a park
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:22.144]  A memorial, here's them, with shields and clubs blocking the entrance from a park for a dead person's memorial.
[03:18:22.184 --> 03:18:26.687]  Now, if that doesn't violate the code, I don't know what does.
[03:18:27.367 --> 03:18:37.873]  And I find it timely that we sit here today with you all discussing getting more funding for police, but I did not hear one person make a suggestion to keep violent criminals off the streets.
[03:18:38.473 --> 03:18:49.947]  Well, maybe if we looked into sanctuary city laws and keeping masked men with guns off the streets, we wouldn't have to have a hundred police officers out there every time somebody wants to have a march, which is every weekend.
[03:18:51.188 --> 03:18:54.953]  Now, I'll just say this in closing and provide an illustration for you.
[03:19:07.412 --> 03:19:15.375]  If I was outside, holding a rifle, keeping people from getting into this city council to state their claim, do you think I should be arrested?
[03:19:16.116 --> 03:19:19.917]  I think everybody here would agree, yes, that should be an arrest.
[03:19:20.277 --> 03:19:20.898]  Absolutely.
[03:19:21.338 --> 03:19:25.860]  But for some reason, and I'm not blaming the APD, because I think they're good men and women.
[03:19:25.900 --> 03:19:28.001]  Most of my experiences with them have been positive.
[03:19:28.721 --> 03:19:43.267]  But if we're not going to arrest armed individuals with masks, brandishing weapons, intimidating people from their free speech, a clear violation of the law, I just want to know why, and I want to know if this city council thinks that that's the type of city that we should live in.
[03:19:43.507 --> 03:19:44.168]  Thank you for your time.
[03:19:44.428 --> 03:19:44.848]  Thank you.
[03:19:45.988 --> 03:19:46.288]  Mayor?
[03:19:46.448 --> 03:19:46.989]  Yes?
[03:19:47.629 --> 03:19:51.070]  If he would provide us with a link, because I couldn't see that.
[03:19:51.831 --> 03:19:52.931]  Absolutely, I'd be happy to.
[03:19:53.451 --> 03:19:53.792]  Thank you.
[03:20:05.655 --> 03:20:16.522]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.542 --> 03:20:22.786]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.146 --> 03:20:26.849]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:29.178 --> 03:20:29.558]  We are live.
[03:20:29.618 --> 03:20:32.881]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:33.261 --> 03:20:39.065]  Final segment of this hour, we're going to play a video that's gone up just about an hour ago on YouTube, The Truth About Social Media.
[03:20:39.626 --> 03:20:50.494]  Really important video in terms of the effect that social media is having, particularly on young people, literally rewiring their brain, causing depression, causing anxiety.
[03:20:50.994 --> 03:20:55.758]  Obviously, there's an irony in there, given that I built a lot of my profile from social media, but it's about
[03:20:56.298 --> 03:20:57.178]  Restricting it.
[03:20:57.198 --> 03:20:59.719]  It's about regaining control over your time.
[03:20:59.759 --> 03:21:03.860]  And this is a big mental health issue right now, especially for millennials.
[03:21:04.360 --> 03:21:07.420]  So be sure to stay tuned for that video in the final segment.
[03:21:07.460 --> 03:21:14.182]  Before we get into the news, though, I want to tell you about the great products at Infowarsstore.com because Alex didn't have a chance to talk about them there.
[03:21:14.482 --> 03:21:17.822]  And as you heard, it's basically a lawsuit every week at this point.
[03:21:17.842 --> 03:21:20.243]  We're under constant attack as this purge
[03:21:20.783 --> 03:21:37.467]  Against Conservatives, Against Libertarians continues in the form of character assassinations, censorships, bans, and in Infowars' case, aside from CNN literally trying to shut down our YouTube channel, frivolous lawsuits on a weekly basis, even twice weekly.
[03:21:37.847 --> 03:21:39.988]  Who knows, maybe in a couple of months it'll be every day.
[03:21:40.448 --> 03:21:43.429]  The feeding frenzy just knows no bounds.
[03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:47.550]  So we have these great specials available right now for you to support us.

[03:22:02.195 --> 03:22:09.123]  We don't even brag about some of the benefits that this formula will give you, given peer-reviewed studies that show in some cases it's
[03:22:10.385 --> 03:22:21.358]  Better than certain anti-depressants that are treating mood disorders and depression, but we sell it on the basis of joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support and immune support.

[03:23:06.107 --> 03:23:06.968]  It improves memory.
[03:23:07.888 --> 03:23:09.370]  It improves mental acuity.

[03:23:29.674 --> 03:23:30.514]  We're under attack.
[03:23:30.774 --> 03:23:34.976]  We've said it for a long time now, but it's literally a lawsuit every week at this point.
[03:23:35.376 --> 03:23:36.017]  You've seen them.
[03:23:36.397 --> 03:23:46.461]  So please continue to support independent, true, grassroots media, not controlled by corporations, not controlled by giant checks from George Soros,
[03:23:47.446 --> 03:23:52.967]  Controlled, directed, only by you, the audience, by supporting us, by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:23:53.887 --> 03:24:03.129]  Now, yesterday Fox News had this headline up, Google snubbed Easter with no doodle for 18th year in a row, Christians say.
[03:24:03.789 --> 03:24:14.552]  Well, I was the one that basically started this story, I'm not a practising Christian, but I noticed that Google had no doodle on their front page whatsoever to recognise Easter.
[03:24:15.192 --> 03:24:15.892]  And people will say,
[03:24:16.542 --> 03:24:18.388]  Well, why do you care about a doodle?
[03:24:18.448 --> 03:24:19.050]  Who cares?
[03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:23.023]  Why are you getting so irate over a drawing on the Google homepage?
[03:24:23.063 --> 03:24:23.183]  Well...
[03:24:24.444 --> 03:24:29.207]  One, it's one of the biggest corporations in the world, if not the biggest in terms of influence.
[03:24:29.687 --> 03:24:36.171]  We're talking about a company in Google that can change the outcome of entire elections based on its algorithm.
[03:24:36.551 --> 03:24:38.732]  That's been proven in scientific studies.
[03:24:39.152 --> 03:24:41.934]  We're talking about a company that has basically become the internet.
[03:24:42.374 --> 03:24:44.315]  To a large degree, it's a monopoly.
[03:24:44.615 --> 03:24:48.998]  We're talking about a company that basically, through its algorithm, through its vast reach,
[03:24:49.578 --> 03:24:50.059]  We're good to go.
[03:25:05.310 --> 03:25:23.439]  Quoting my tweet, quoting my article, which was written earlier in the day, or in fact the day before, basically saying, why does Google have a doodle for every obscure, woke, progressive, far-left person, activist, whatever, or event imaginable, but not for Easter?
[03:25:23.880 --> 03:25:31.644]  Why did they have absolutely nothing, no doodle, no recognition for Easter Sunday or Easter Monday, the entire Easter period?
[03:25:31.704 --> 03:25:33.845]  There was nothing, absolutely nothing.
[03:25:34.699 --> 03:25:36.463]  James Woods, the actor, picked up on this.
[03:25:36.503 --> 03:25:37.705]  He retweeted my tweet.
[03:25:37.745 --> 03:25:38.066]  He said,
[03:25:42.139 --> 03:25:43.659]  So again, this is becoming an issue.
[03:25:43.699 --> 03:25:45.160]  We heard the James Damore case.
[03:25:45.180 --> 03:25:49.761]  We heard the stories out there where, you know, people would literally get booed and heckled because they were white.
[03:25:50.301 --> 03:25:51.761]  What is the policy?
[03:25:51.821 --> 03:25:55.202]  What is the outlook of one of the biggest corporations in the world?
[03:25:55.702 --> 03:25:59.223]  One of, if not the most powerful corporation in the world.
[03:25:59.403 --> 03:26:04.184]  That's a pretty big issue, what their corporate philosophy is, because it reflects on the world.
[03:26:04.484 --> 03:26:07.885]  It reflects on the people who use their services, which number in the billions.
[03:26:08.125 --> 03:26:08.985]  Pretty big deal.
[03:26:09.265 --> 03:26:09.945]  Pretty big deal.
[03:26:11.221 --> 03:26:12.625]  So then we had this.
[03:26:13.306 --> 03:26:14.610]  Oh, by the way, before I get into it...
[03:26:15.680 --> 03:26:23.485]  Google has previously devoted a doodle to Yuri Kochiyama, a communist activist who said she admired Osama Bin Laden.
[03:26:23.805 --> 03:26:25.146]  She gets a doodle.
[03:26:25.726 --> 03:26:28.428]  Easter, Christians, they get nothing.
[03:26:28.948 --> 03:26:34.532]  Okay, so they'll honour communist activists who admire terrorists, but not Easter, not Christians.
[03:26:34.992 --> 03:26:43.297]  So then CNN's Andrew Kaczynski comes out, who by the way was the guy who threatened to dox the individual who created the Trump-CNN wrestling meme.
[03:26:43.337 --> 03:26:43.918]  He's a nice guy.
[03:26:44.989 --> 03:26:55.997]  He came out and said this, this article which features quotes from an InfoWars editor and a Pizzagate hoaxer, notes the final graph, notes in the final paragraph, Google doesn't do doodles for religious holidays.
[03:26:56.397 --> 03:26:57.237]  Embarrassing!
[03:26:58.178 --> 03:26:58.478]  Okay.
[03:26:59.539 --> 03:27:05.083]  So he's claiming that Google didn't do a doodle for Easter because it never does doodles for religious holidays.
[03:27:05.983 --> 03:27:08.325]  Except it did literally a month ago.
[03:27:10.607 --> 03:27:12.388]  This is a CNN reporter.
[03:27:13.049 --> 03:27:27.397]  Spinning fake news to smear Christians, calling me embarrassing when he can't even check back one frigging month on Google's official website, which had a doodle for the Hindu Holi Religious Festival.
[03:27:27.457 --> 03:27:28.258]  It's called Holi.
[03:27:28.678 --> 03:27:29.899]  It's a religious festival.
[03:27:30.019 --> 03:27:31.099]  It's a Hindu festival.
[03:27:31.379 --> 03:27:32.960]  They had a doodle for it a month ago.
[03:27:33.240 --> 03:27:34.401]  It's on their own website.
[03:27:35.001 --> 03:27:37.903]  So, Kaczynski, your research is terrible.
[03:27:37.943 --> 03:27:38.864]  See me after class.
[03:27:38.924 --> 03:27:41.165]  You're perpetuating fake news.
[03:27:42.429 --> 03:27:44.111]  So then someone else responded to his tweet.
[03:27:44.131 --> 03:27:51.862]  They said the Fox News article he has linked has a statement from Google that directly mentions the Hindu... the Holy Doodle, the Hindu religious festival.
[03:27:52.983 --> 03:27:53.164]  Yeah.
[03:27:54.750 --> 03:27:58.211]  And he says, how are you able to breathe consistently while being this utterly stupid?
[03:27:58.692 --> 03:28:04.414]  Well, I'm able to breathe consistently because the Holi Hindu Festival is a religious festival.
[03:28:04.474 --> 03:28:13.958]  You see, Google isn't going to tell you that, but if you go on the Wikipedia page for the Holi Festival, it says, quote, Holi is an ancient Hindu religious festival.
[03:28:14.938 --> 03:28:19.842]  You can go on a Telegraph article and read about how, quote, they perform religious rituals.
[03:28:20.183 --> 03:28:22.485]  So yes, Google had a religious doodle.
[03:28:22.765 --> 03:28:26.268]  That is a religious festival on their homepage a month ago.
[03:28:26.588 --> 03:28:27.869]  CNN's lying about it.
[03:28:28.109 --> 03:28:29.511]  Kaczynski's lying about it.
[03:28:29.911 --> 03:28:32.213]  All these brainwashed followers of his are lying about it.
[03:28:32.513 --> 03:28:36.377]  And yes, it's important because Google is one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[03:28:36.617 --> 03:28:37.918]  They have vast influence.
[03:28:38.318 --> 03:28:41.341]  Their corporate philosophy, how they look at Christians,
[03:28:41.841 --> 03:28:43.202]  That is of importance.
[03:28:43.262 --> 03:28:50.744]  So yes, of course it's of importance what's on their homepage during one of the biggest Christian religious festivals on the calendar.
[03:28:50.964 --> 03:28:52.344]  So yes, it matters.
[03:28:52.865 --> 03:28:55.125]  We'll be back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:55.185 --> 03:28:56.486]  InfoWars.com.
[03:28:56.506 --> 03:28:57.066]  Don't go away.
[03:29:02.190 --> 03:29:03.552]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:29:03.832 --> 03:29:05.114]  You can't survive without it.
[03:29:05.315 --> 03:29:06.216]  But where do you get it?
[03:29:06.516 --> 03:29:12.284]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:29:12.505 --> 03:29:18.253]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:29:18.413 --> 03:29:35.280]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:29:35.680 --> 03:29:37.802]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:29:38.162 --> 03:29:39.363]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:29:39.623 --> 03:29:40.384]  Easy assembly.

[03:30:06.681 --> 03:30:15.203]  I was talking to Steven Seagal last night and this morning, and he had some very heartfelt, very, I think, compelling things to say that, just at a gut level, rang true to me.
[03:30:15.663 --> 03:30:17.743]  Plus, what we've seen what's been done to the president, now admitted.
[03:30:17.803 --> 03:30:22.344]  Some women offered up two million big Democratic Party donors to say that Trump raped them.
[03:30:22.724 --> 03:30:23.904]  The women have recorded this.
[03:30:24.064 --> 03:30:25.224]  I know the FBI has it.
[03:30:25.564 --> 03:30:26.685]  We first broke that months ago.
[03:30:26.725 --> 03:30:27.705]  That's now been in the news.
[03:30:28.185 --> 03:30:30.645]  So we know there's a bunch of foul play going on.
[03:30:30.665 --> 03:30:33.526]  I don't know personally about this latest thing or what happened.
[03:30:34.446 --> 03:30:35.667]  One, I think this person's a great person.
[03:30:35.687 --> 03:30:36.788]  I don't have a dog in that fight.
[03:30:37.268 --> 03:30:41.171]  I just know Steven Seagal and his lawyers, a former, you know, star prosecutor.
[03:30:41.491 --> 03:30:42.932]  What they're saying, I've followed.
[03:30:43.632 --> 03:30:44.433]  It has gone on.
[03:30:44.453 --> 03:30:45.513]  The story's very vague.
[03:30:45.533 --> 03:30:46.314]  A lot of it's wrong.
[03:30:46.594 --> 03:30:47.595]  Now things are being added.
[03:30:47.615 --> 03:30:52.118]  The thing that I find interesting is this woman is saying she was in my movie.
[03:30:52.538 --> 03:30:54.518]  There's no record of her being in my movie.
[03:30:54.778 --> 03:30:55.719]  She doesn't have a credit.
[03:30:55.999 --> 03:30:56.899]  We've looked through the movie.
[03:30:56.939 --> 03:30:58.039]  She's not in the movie.
[03:30:58.399 --> 03:31:01.060]  She says she came to my home in Beverly Hills.
[03:31:01.120 --> 03:31:01.540]  Guess what?
[03:31:01.700 --> 03:31:03.840]  I didn't have a home in Beverly Hills.
[03:31:03.960 --> 03:31:05.761]  I think these are all made-up stories.
[03:31:06.621 --> 03:31:15.943]  And, you know, I not only resent it, but this is something that is designed to destroy my life, destroy my income, destroy my marriage.
[03:31:16.443 --> 03:31:22.465]  Destroy my children and my children's lives, and it is evil what they're doing.
[03:31:22.525 --> 03:31:27.107]  We have 90 to 95% fake journalism, fake news.
[03:31:27.127 --> 03:31:30.528]  90 to 95% of the news in America now is fake news.
[03:31:30.588 --> 03:31:34.269]  Nobody has ever told you before, nobody knows what's true and what's not.
[03:31:34.830 --> 03:31:39.231]  And when you're in a situation like that where you don't know what's true and what's not,
[03:31:41.992 --> 03:31:43.394]  How can you weather the storm?
[03:31:43.414 --> 03:31:44.715]  How can you walk forward?
[03:31:45.176 --> 03:31:50.081]  How can you do anything and know that you're right about what you're doing?
[03:31:50.402 --> 03:31:52.825]  How can you make a decision and know that you're right, you know?
[03:31:52.885 --> 03:31:56.309]  Like I say, there's a deeper, deeper, darker picture here going on.
[03:31:57.129 --> 03:32:11.705]  And what's really happening in my opinion is not just the witch hunt and the McCarthyism, but it's also, I believe, and I shouldn't be the one to say this, but I will, and I'm sure you'll confirm it, I'm also being persecuted for my political views.
[03:32:12.265 --> 03:32:12.825]  I don't know.
[03:32:31.512 --> 03:32:42.240]  Our secret society is to overthrow Trump and destroy anyone who is friends with Trump or supporting Trump and particularly supporting Putin.
[03:32:42.760 --> 03:32:51.026]  And once they do this, their agenda is to be able to overthrow the America that is there now and start a war with Russia.
[03:32:51.386 --> 03:32:56.090]  That's what we all are starting to see.
[03:33:06.491 --> 03:33:15.575]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.236 --> 03:33:18.016]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.377 --> 03:33:21.298]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:33:23.879 --> 03:33:26.701]  Here is the big video I promised it went up about an hour ago.
[03:33:26.741 --> 03:33:28.041]  Huge, important video.
[03:33:28.061 --> 03:33:28.782]  Please share it.
[03:33:28.822 --> 03:33:31.043]  This is the truth about social media.
[03:33:31.063 --> 03:33:31.603]  Let's roll it.
[03:33:32.338 --> 03:33:35.740]  Weren't we all a lot happier before social media existed?
[03:33:35.800 --> 03:33:44.686]  Here's social media stripping us of our basic humanity, stunting our intellect, making us depressed, and irreparably damaging personal relationships.
[03:33:44.786 --> 03:33:54.233]  One of Facebook's earliest executives dropped a bombshell when he admitted that social media was programming its users and destroying the fabric of society.
[03:33:54.253 --> 03:33:55.294]  I feel tremendous guilt.
[03:33:55.794 --> 03:33:57.115]  It literally is a point now.
[03:33:58.220 --> 03:34:03.805]  Where I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.
[03:34:04.386 --> 03:34:05.587]  That is truly where we are.
[03:34:05.747 --> 03:34:09.791]  Your behaviors, you don't realize it, but you are being programmed.
[03:34:11.733 --> 03:34:12.834]  It was unintentional.
[03:34:13.621 --> 03:34:15.902]  But now you gotta decide how much you're willing to give up.
[03:34:15.982 --> 03:34:18.404]  Social media was designed to be addictive.
[03:34:18.604 --> 03:34:24.447]  It provides the same kind of dopamine here that you get from smoking, drinking alcohol, or gambling.
[03:34:24.547 --> 03:34:31.731]  We know that engagement with social media and our cell phones releases a chemical called dopamine.
[03:34:32.111 --> 03:34:34.092]  That's why when you get a text, it feels good.
[03:34:34.673 --> 03:34:34.833]  Right?
[03:34:35.073 --> 03:34:41.817]  So, you know, we've all had it where you're feeling a little bit down or feeling a bit lonely, and so you send out ten texts to ten friends, you know, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
[03:34:43.345 --> 03:34:45.387]  Because it feels good when you get a response, right?
[03:34:46.768 --> 03:34:46.928]  Right?
[03:34:47.308 --> 03:34:56.716]  It's why we count the likes, it's why we go back ten times to see if, and if it's going, if my Instagram is growing slower, did I do something wrong, do they not like me anymore, right?
[03:34:57.157 --> 03:35:00.259]  The trauma for young kids to be unfriended, right?
[03:35:01.320 --> 03:35:04.103]  Because we know when you get it, you get a hit of dopamine, which feels good.
[03:35:04.143 --> 03:35:06.084]  It's why we like it, it's why we keep going back to it.
[03:35:06.765 --> 03:35:11.028]  Dopamine is the exact same chemical that makes us feel good when we smoke, when we drink,
[03:35:11.889 --> 03:35:12.730]  And when we gamble.
[03:35:13.351 --> 03:35:16.395]  In other words, it's highly, highly addictive.
[03:35:16.475 --> 03:35:22.343]  We're so addicted, our brains sometimes fool us into thinking a dopamine hit is imminent, when it isn't!
[03:35:22.423 --> 03:35:25.227]  I'm talking about Phantom Vibration Syndrome.
[03:35:25.287 --> 03:35:26.809]  This means those people think the
[03:35:26.869 --> 03:35:28.991]  The phone is vibrating when it's really not.
[03:35:29.131 --> 03:35:32.254]  And psychologists say these fake phone calls are all in your head.
[03:35:32.314 --> 03:35:40.982]  Those who are big time talkers on the phone or who use the phone to text or tweet a lot, well they say they feel these fake phone calls more often.
[03:35:41.522 --> 03:35:43.384]  And so do people who are anxious or insecure.
[03:35:43.544 --> 03:35:47.725]  Next time you're in a car driving down a busy street, look out the window.
[03:35:47.845 --> 03:35:52.606]  Notice how many young people have their heads buried in their phones.
[03:35:52.766 --> 03:36:01.949]  Even in an environment where there are potential threats, obstacles, and things of interest to observe and absorb, they still can't tear themselves away.
[03:36:02.009 --> 03:36:08.650]  This addiction has overridden their basic survival mechanism of being aware of their surroundings in an open environment.
[03:36:08.950 --> 03:36:11.131]  That's how addicted they are.
[03:36:13.325 --> 03:36:14.606]  I mean, look at the one on the right.
[03:36:14.626 --> 03:36:16.909]  Do you have to make faces when you take selfies?
[03:36:16.949 --> 03:36:19.732]  Wait, one more now.
[03:36:19.952 --> 03:36:20.533]  Better angle.
[03:36:22.395 --> 03:36:22.875]  Oh, check it.
[03:36:22.895 --> 03:36:23.856]  Did that come out okay?
[03:36:23.896 --> 03:36:27.000]  That's the best one of the 300 pictures I've taken of myself today!
[03:36:27.220 --> 03:36:29.583]  Every girl in the picture is locked into her phone.
[03:36:31.731 --> 03:36:34.073]  Every single one is dialed in.
[03:36:34.113 --> 03:36:35.354]  Welcome to parenting in 2015.
[03:36:36.415 --> 03:36:39.718]  They're all just completely transfixed by the technology.
[03:36:39.818 --> 03:36:43.781]  Why are millennials particularly vulnerable to social media addiction?
[03:36:43.821 --> 03:36:50.547]  Because their parents and daycare instilled in them an endless, desperate compulsion for validation.
[03:36:50.607 --> 03:36:52.929]  This is the me, me, me generation.
[03:36:53.129 --> 03:36:56.893]  This is the generation with the lowest self-esteem ever.
[03:36:57.193 --> 03:37:00.754]  It's the constant need for reassurance that they exist.
[03:37:00.914 --> 03:37:01.995]  What fulfills that need?
[03:37:02.415 --> 03:37:03.295]  Social media.
[03:37:03.315 --> 03:37:12.219]  This is a generation whose natural coping mechanisms are so eroded, they've adopted rampant narcissism as a form of stress relief.
[03:37:12.479 --> 03:37:14.300]  Where is that narcissism most rewarded?
[03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:15.640]  You guessed it.
[03:37:15.900 --> 03:37:16.701]  Social media.
[03:37:16.781 --> 03:37:21.202]  Likes, shares and retweets are to a millennial what a pacifier is to a baby.
[03:37:21.322 --> 03:37:23.643]  It's literally infantilising our brains.
[03:37:23.723 --> 03:37:26.284]  It's regressing us back to infanthood.
[03:37:26.344 --> 03:37:27.904]  And what's another trait of infanthood?
[03:37:28.464 --> 03:37:30.065]  Short attention spans.
[03:37:30.185 --> 03:37:33.267]  Our attention spans have been decimated by social media.
[03:37:33.307 --> 03:37:37.109]  We're kept in a perpetual state of distraction and disruption.
[03:37:37.149 --> 03:37:44.814]  This constant influx of new information prevents our brains from being able to process that info and send it into long-term memory.
[03:37:44.834 --> 03:37:48.617]  Do you ever wonder why your memory seems so much worse than it used to be?
[03:37:48.697 --> 03:37:55.061]  If you're constantly distracted by new information, you can't devote the required attentiveness to any one subject.
[03:37:55.341 --> 03:37:58.103]  So everything is just a superficial snapshot.
[03:37:58.223 --> 03:38:02.805]  Some of you probably got distracted 30 seconds into this video and started reading the comments.
[03:38:03.065 --> 03:38:06.827]  Our brains adapt physically to our changing environment.
[03:38:06.847 --> 03:38:08.768]  This is called neuroplasticity.
[03:38:08.808 --> 03:38:15.392]  Social media and the internet in general has rewired our brains to make us only capable of shallow thinking.
[03:38:15.432 --> 03:38:21.275]  Studies also show that the more distracted you are, the more difficult it is to feel empathy.
[03:38:21.895 --> 03:38:24.136]  Another casualty of social media.
[03:38:24.196 --> 03:38:36.679]  Social media also causes depression because people are seeing the carefully curated highlight reels of other people's amazingly interesting lives, then feeling inadequate and lonely when they compare it to their own.
[03:38:36.819 --> 03:38:42.041]  An added irony is that while millennials use social media to alleviate their stress,
[03:38:42.381 --> 03:38:44.722]  It's actually causing them more stress.
[03:38:44.782 --> 03:38:52.406]  A University of Queensland study found that quitting Facebook for just five days led to a noticeable drop in cortisol levels.
[03:38:52.546 --> 03:39:00.290]  Social media can also be blamed for the obsession with identity politics that's tearing apart the fabric of civil discourse.
[03:39:00.390 --> 03:39:03.651]  Real world experience forms rounded characters.
[03:39:03.791 --> 03:39:07.192]  Social media draws us away from the real world.
[03:39:07.252 --> 03:39:12.973]  This vacuum of real world experience causes confusion and identity crisis.
[03:39:13.093 --> 03:39:15.513]  Hence 75 different genders.
[03:39:15.553 --> 03:39:22.355]  There's even a link between the rise in smartphone and social media use and the emergence of college campus snowflakes.
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:30.866]  It short-circuits the brain, and we're starting to find that it has actual cognitive consequences, one of them being this sort of pervasive background hum of anxiety.
[03:39:32.947 --> 03:39:35.509]  Now, the canary in the coal mine for this issue is actually college campuses.
[03:39:36.490 --> 03:39:39.933]  If you talk to mental health experts on college campuses, they'll tell you.
[03:39:41.214 --> 03:39:49.140]  Along with the rise of ubiquitous smartphone use and social media use among the students on the campus came an explosion of anxiety-related disorders.
[03:39:50.551 --> 03:39:58.130]  Students who are bathed in this constant background hum of anxiety are so emotionally brittle, they're triggered by anything.
[03:39:59.687 --> 03:40:01.129]  Positives of social media?
[03:40:01.149 --> 03:40:03.011]  Well, everyone has a voice.
[03:40:03.111 --> 03:40:14.784]  And while in principle this allows for the democratization of information, in practice it equates to billions of retards sharing pictures of their food and hurling vile insults at strangers for having the wrong opinion.
[03:40:14.804 --> 03:40:21.251]  It equates to maniacal witch hunt mobs destroying people's reputations and careers because they said something deemed
[03:40:21.611 --> 03:40:31.217]  And yes, I'm painfully aware of the irony of someone who has forged an identity partly thanks to social media lecturing you about how terrible social media is.
[03:40:31.237 --> 03:40:34.379]  But this is as much an instructional video for me as it is for you.
[03:40:34.539 --> 03:40:35.760]  We're all addicts.
[03:40:35.820 --> 03:40:41.584]  We need to modify our behavior before it modifies us permanently.
[03:40:41.684 --> 03:40:44.485]  We have to escape this electronic ghetto.
[03:40:44.605 --> 03:40:46.447]  Here's a few things we can all do now.
[03:40:46.527 --> 03:40:47.007]  Turn off
[03:40:47.407 --> 03:40:49.909]  All non-essential notifications on your phone.
[03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:55.753]  Try and make a routine of only checking your messages and emails a maximum of five times a day.
[03:40:56.113 --> 03:40:57.134]  Less if possible.
[03:40:57.254 --> 03:40:59.676]  Use the internet like your parents use the internet.
[03:40:59.936 --> 03:41:01.677]  Go on there to do what you intend to do.
[03:41:02.197 --> 03:41:02.778]  Then get off!
[03:41:03.038 --> 03:41:05.819]  Don't get distracted by a hundred different strands.
[03:41:06.119 --> 03:41:07.360]  Don't surf the web.
[03:41:07.460 --> 03:41:08.560]  Try and be disciplined.
[03:41:08.680 --> 03:41:11.261]  Respect the value of your own time.
[03:41:11.341 --> 03:41:13.222]  Don't charge your phone next to your bed.
[03:41:13.442 --> 03:41:18.104]  Don't be pressured to check all the messages on all your accounts as soon as you wake up.
[03:41:18.164 --> 03:41:22.166]  Leave your phone in a different room to the one you're in at every opportunity.
[03:41:22.186 --> 03:41:24.487]  And if it's not absolutely essential for your career,
[03:41:24.867 --> 03:41:27.068]  Just get off social media entirely.
[03:41:27.108 --> 03:41:32.772]  There's no point in being a public figure if you don't get any of the benefits of being a public figure.
[03:41:32.832 --> 03:41:40.796]  If you implement these changes, and I've got to implement them too, you'll be far happier, more productive, and a better person to be around.
[03:41:40.876 --> 03:41:46.760]  You'll be free of the background hum of anxiety and depression that social media perpetuates.
[03:41:48.040 --> 03:41:51.381]  2018 is being described by some as the year of the Neo-Luddite.
[03:41:51.521 --> 03:41:54.762]  An underground backlash against technology is brewing.
[03:41:54.882 --> 03:42:00.923]  More people than ever are beginning to feel that technological progress is not always beneficial.
[03:42:00.963 --> 03:42:03.624]  Violent anti-tech attacks are increasing.
[03:42:03.684 --> 03:42:07.525]  According to American philosopher John Cezanne, something is going on.
[03:42:07.665 --> 03:42:14.529]  Zerzan was a controversial supporter of the ideology of Ted Kaczynski, the Unibomber, although he condemned his actions.
[03:42:14.649 --> 03:42:23.173]  Kaczynski thought technological change had destabilized society, made life unfulfilling, and caused massive psychological suffering.
[03:42:23.253 --> 03:42:30.637]  While Kaczynski's response was deplorable, you'd be hard-pressed to deny that some of his fears have been realized.
[03:42:30.777 --> 03:42:33.719]  Professor Zerzan thinks the emergence of another Unibomber
[03:42:34.279 --> 03:42:35.039]  Is inevitable.
[03:42:35.159 --> 03:42:39.801]  Others even fear the rise of Luddite terror groups to rival Islamic jihadists.
[03:42:39.901 --> 03:42:49.543]  But before we allow fringe extremists to fill the void, we need to reassert control over our impulses, our emotions, and the very structure of our brains.
[03:42:49.683 --> 03:42:58.526]  Social media is turning us into addicts, and it's time to change our habits before we all become hopeless junkies.
[03:43:02.665 --> 03:43:04.985]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:43:05.005 --> 03:43:06.726]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:43:07.166 --> 03:43:10.046]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:43:11.086 --> 03:43:22.148]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:43:22.588 --> 03:43:31.690]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[03:43:43.415 --> 03:43:45.376]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:43:45.676 --> 03:43:47.697]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:43:48.970 --> 03:43:51.771]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:43:51.971 --> 03:43:53.372]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:43:53.992 --> 03:43:56.553]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:43:57.313 --> 03:43:59.274]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:43:59.834 --> 03:44:02.075]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[03:44:02.691 --> 03:44:04.733]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:44:04.994 --> 03:44:06.315]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[03:44:06.555 --> 03:44:10.079]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[03:44:10.460 --> 03:44:18.188]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[03:44:18.409 --> 03:44:23.214]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:44:23.374 --> 03:44:24.095]  The reality is
[03:44:24.375 --> 03:44:28.837]  It's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[03:44:29.177 --> 03:44:36.699]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[03:44:36.939 --> 03:44:41.361]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:44:41.661 --> 03:44:47.423]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[03:44:47.523 --> 03:44:50.504]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:44:50.684 --> 03:44:53.965]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[03:44:54.245 --> 03:44:57.906]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:58.126 --> 03:44:59.747]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:03.658 --> 03:45:08.101]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:45:08.342 --> 03:45:13.025]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:45:13.646 --> 03:45:19.490]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:32.500]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:45:33.240 --> 03:45:41.930]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law Family Code.
[03:45:41.950 --> 03:45:43.852]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:45:44.173 --> 03:45:45.354]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:45:45.374 --> 03:45:46.555]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:45:46.575 --> 03:45:47.997]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:45:48.097 --> 03:45:49.657]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:45:50.177 --> 03:45:51.778]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:45:51.798 --> 03:45:53.578]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:45:53.938 --> 03:45:56.539]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:45:56.579 --> 03:45:57.439]  This is insane.
[03:45:57.839 --> 03:45:59.479]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:45:59.719 --> 03:46:02.280]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:46:02.720 --> 03:46:04.260]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:46:04.280 --> 03:46:06.121]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:46:06.141 --> 03:46:07.981]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:46:08.841 --> 03:46:14.783]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:46:15.023 --> 03:46:16.363]  All just moderate dose.
[03:46:17.892 --> 03:46:25.880]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain that Mother Nature, God gave us through Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:46:25.920 --> 03:46:28.302]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:28.362 --> 03:46:29.484]  But thank you for committing.
[03:46:33.547 --> 03:46:36.368]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:46:36.748 --> 03:46:39.369]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:46:39.389 --> 03:46:44.150]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:46:44.610 --> 03:46:50.732]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:46:50.772 --> 03:46:53.872]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:46:54.213 --> 03:46:55.533]  It's called reap what you show.
[03:47:06.014 --> 03:47:10.517]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.939 --> 03:47:16.301]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:16.481 --> 03:47:17.722]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.882 --> 03:47:20.123]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:30.532 --> 03:47:30.992]  We are back.
[03:47:31.012 --> 03:47:33.814]  It is the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.934 --> 03:47:36.015]  War Room with Owen Troyer is coming up next.
[03:47:36.095 --> 03:47:44.981]  But I first want to direct you back to Infowarsstore.com because again, we're under a sustained attack on a weekly basis with lawsuit after lawsuit piling on top of one another.
[03:47:45.381 --> 03:47:49.303]  So please continue to support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:47:49.623 --> 03:47:51.444]  We have Brain Force Plus at 50%, 5-0% off.
[03:47:54.406 --> 03:47:55.487]  For a limited time only.
[03:47:55.887 --> 03:47:58.089]  Again, that is our Nootropic brand.
[03:47:58.470 --> 03:48:02.053]  It helps with concentration, mental acuity and memory.
[03:48:02.073 --> 03:48:03.274]  It really works.
[03:48:03.434 --> 03:48:04.895]  Everyone in Silicon Valley is doing it.
[03:48:05.335 --> 03:48:10.860]  This is a big frontier of mental performance supplementation right now.
[03:48:11.320 --> 03:48:14.403]  It's called Nootropics and ours is called BrainForce Plus.
[03:48:14.443 --> 03:48:18.927]  It's available for 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com, where we also have
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:21.680]  Bodies back at 25% off.
[03:48:22.041 --> 03:48:27.302]  This is the Joint Support, Mobility Support, Flexibility Support, Inflammation Support.
[03:48:27.622 --> 03:48:36.504]  We don't even mention the Mood Enhancement Benefits of Turmeric, which has been proven in peer-reviewed scientific studies to have those benefits.
[03:48:36.545 --> 03:48:44.807]  We've got it back in stock at 50% off right now at infowarsstore.com, as well as a bunch of other products available right now.
[03:48:44.847 --> 03:48:47.087]  Please continue to support this network.
[03:48:47.127 --> 03:48:49.228]  We're not dependent on outside sponsors.
[03:48:50.163 --> 03:48:59.424]  So we can't be targeted by the kind of boycott campaign that you saw Laura Ingraham over at Fox News be targeted by with David Hogg and that whole witch hunt outrage mob.
[03:48:59.764 --> 03:49:00.807]  They can't get us that way.
[03:49:01.573 --> 03:49:11.199]  Apparently they've just chosen to file frivolous lawsuit week after week to kind of create this crisis mentality that we're going down even though we win every single lawsuit.
[03:49:11.579 --> 03:49:13.980]  But they can celebrate and it actually comes down to it.
[03:49:14.040 --> 03:49:14.561]  We thrive.
[03:49:14.641 --> 03:49:15.241]  We prosper.
[03:49:15.281 --> 03:49:16.242]  We actually get bigger.
[03:49:16.742 --> 03:49:17.322]  Keep going.
[03:49:17.402 --> 03:49:17.963]  Keep going.
[03:49:18.023 --> 03:49:18.463]  Well done.
[03:49:18.923 --> 03:49:20.424]  Please continue to support us though.
[03:49:20.444 --> 03:49:24.887]  We're only able to keep going with your support by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:49:25.847 --> 03:49:28.389]  Now let's get into some more of this news right now.
[03:49:29.184 --> 03:49:33.127]  Big poll out today from Monmouth University, and this is up on brightbar.com.
[03:49:35.489 --> 03:49:38.431]  77% believe traditional media guilty of fake news.
[03:49:38.511 --> 03:49:40.352]  That is absolutely huge.
[03:49:40.492 --> 03:49:45.476]  The vast majority of Americans believe mainstream media outlets report, quote, fake news.
[03:49:46.477 --> 03:49:53.222]  Now, of course, the mainstream media, the legacy media itself, right at the, even before the election, even before,
[03:49:53.965 --> 03:50:14.459]  Contrived that hysteria, contrived that moral panic of fake news and oh how delicious, how hilarious it is to see how much it's blown back in their faces to the point where 77% of Americans, this is out of 800 respondents, say that the mainstream media puts out fake news.
[03:50:14.479 --> 03:50:21.123]  83% of those questioned believe that special interest groups intentionally seek to implant the mainstream news cycle with false information.
[03:50:22.196 --> 03:50:27.499]  And 87% believe that those same forces influence social media such as Facebook as well as YouTube.
[03:50:28.379 --> 03:50:38.284]  So the vast majority of the American people know that this whole fake news scandal, which was created to try and discredit, to try and demean alternative news outlets.
[03:50:38.464 --> 03:50:47.508]  Now let's not deny that there are fake news outlets that deliberately put out misleading information, false information, which they know not to be true.
[03:50:48.490 --> 03:50:58.097]  But the Stanford University study, other studies proved that that did not have any kind of significant impact on the US election, had no significant impact on Brexit.
[03:50:58.965 --> 03:51:02.727]  The problem is far, far tinier than they made it out to be.
[03:51:02.967 --> 03:51:19.715]  They were butthurt at the fact that they're losing, at the fact that the political paradigm, the current climate is shifting against their favour, in terms of the populist revolution that swept Europe over the past three years, that they created this conspiracy theory that it was all due to fake news.
[03:51:20.076 --> 03:51:21.076]  No evidence for it.
[03:51:21.316 --> 03:51:28.560]  When you actually look at the figures, it hasn't had a big impact, but it has had a big impact in blowing back on them, which is why it's so hilarious.
[03:51:29.229 --> 03:51:38.682]  Which is why now this whole, you know, this hysteria over Sinclair Broadcasting and that fake news package that they put together criticising fake news is kind of funny.
[03:51:39.582 --> 03:51:44.325]  Because they're using it to say, look at what the conservative right-wing Sinclair Broadcasting does.
[03:51:44.645 --> 03:51:50.268]  Because CNN would never have a consensus which they enforce throughout their news organisation, would they?
[03:51:50.769 --> 03:51:51.209]  Oh no.
[03:51:51.649 --> 03:51:54.111]  They don't hire people based on their political beliefs.
[03:51:54.371 --> 03:51:56.872]  They don't fire people based on their political beliefs.
[03:51:57.192 --> 03:51:59.614]  How many Trump supporters who were working for CNN?
[03:52:00.549 --> 03:52:02.591]  Because they tried to feign some kind of balance.
[03:52:02.631 --> 03:52:05.132]  How many of those have been fired since the election?
[03:52:05.533 --> 03:52:08.675]  So don't try and pretend that you don't have a bias.
[03:52:09.055 --> 03:52:10.276]  Everybody has a bias.
[03:52:10.536 --> 03:52:11.297]  We have a bias.
[03:52:11.517 --> 03:52:12.638]  We're just honest about it.
[03:52:12.778 --> 03:52:13.559]  We admit to it.
[03:52:13.939 --> 03:52:14.499]  You don't.
[03:52:14.799 --> 03:52:17.161]  You pretend to be neutral and impartial.
[03:52:17.521 --> 03:52:21.424]  Jim Acosta literally screaming out at Trump every time he gets the chance.
[03:52:21.745 --> 03:52:23.346]  He's not a neutral reporter.
[03:52:23.606 --> 03:52:25.247]  He's not an impartial journalist.
[03:52:25.527 --> 03:52:26.248]  He's an activist.
[03:52:27.248 --> 03:52:30.050]  CNN has become an activist news organization.
[03:52:30.470 --> 03:52:32.712]  Which is fine, but just admit to it, okay?
[03:52:33.852 --> 03:52:34.893]  You are the fake news.
[03:52:35.213 --> 03:52:43.318]  This has blown back in your faces and it's absolutely hilarious, which is why you're now trying to censor everyone else and literally lobbying to have our YouTube channel shut down.
[03:52:43.979 --> 03:52:49.402]  Because you're so nervous that there will be a slight chance of competition.
[03:52:50.063 --> 03:52:52.304]  Like, CNN is way bigger than InfoWars.
[03:52:52.384 --> 03:52:56.547]  It dwarfs us in terms of size, money, income, employees, whatever way you want to look at it.
[03:52:57.361 --> 03:52:58.982]  So why are they so nervous?
[03:52:59.502 --> 03:53:01.783]  Why do they attack me on a regular basis?
[03:53:02.543 --> 03:53:05.084]  If we were so inconsequential, just ignore us.
[03:53:06.144 --> 03:53:10.886]  They don't because they're nervous because their average viewer is aged 60 years old.
[03:53:11.547 --> 03:53:12.227]  They're dying.
[03:53:12.287 --> 03:53:13.427]  They're literally dying.
[03:53:13.947 --> 03:53:15.628]  They're not resonating with people anymore.
[03:53:15.808 --> 03:53:17.489]  They can't get one show in the top 20.
[03:53:18.863 --> 03:53:19.944]  And they blame us for that.
[03:53:20.004 --> 03:53:20.204]  No.
[03:53:20.504 --> 03:53:21.485]  It's your content.
[03:53:21.745 --> 03:53:22.585]  It's your bias.
[03:53:22.885 --> 03:53:24.126]  It's your fake news.
[03:53:24.146 --> 03:53:30.030]  Which is why 77% of Americans now believe that the mainstream media puts out fake news.
[03:53:30.090 --> 03:53:31.310]  Well done on that narrative.
[03:53:31.350 --> 03:53:32.811]  That worked out great for you, didn't it?
[03:53:33.131 --> 03:53:33.592]  Idiots.
[03:53:34.152 --> 03:53:37.354]  Malaysia to punish fake news with six-year prison sentences.
[03:53:37.854 --> 03:53:39.135]  Now isn't this interesting?
[03:53:39.781 --> 03:53:42.222]  Because we've seen this out of the European Union as well.
[03:53:42.762 --> 03:53:51.904]  Authoritarian regimes and political bodies hijacking this contrived hysteria about fake news to prosecute, to punish political dissidents.
[03:53:52.064 --> 03:53:53.044]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:53:53.724 --> 03:54:00.546]  That authoritarian regimes would catch on to something created by the legacy media establishment in the United States.
[03:54:02.266 --> 03:54:07.668]  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's government approved a law banning the malicious spread of false news.
[03:54:07.708 --> 03:54:09.348]  Again, completely subjective term.
[03:54:10.285 --> 03:54:15.929]  Reporting on Monday, instituting penalties of up to six years in prison and $125,000.
[03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:18.171]  Six years in prison!
[03:54:18.191 --> 03:54:24.816]  For somebody who probably would unwittingly post fake news, the very definition of which is completely subjective.
[03:54:26.917 --> 03:54:32.661]  I mean, I've talked about earlier, they were saying with the Google, they were saying Google does not recognise religious festivals.
[03:54:32.761 --> 03:54:35.203]  It never has, that's why it didn't recognise Easter.
[03:54:35.223 --> 03:54:35.263]  BS!
[03:54:37.444 --> 03:54:43.965]  One month ago, they recognised the Hindu Holi religious festival with a doodle on their homepage.
[03:54:44.345 --> 03:54:46.586]  Okay, that's CNN putting out fake news.
[03:54:46.626 --> 03:54:47.886]  Anyone going to get in trouble for that?
[03:54:48.446 --> 03:54:54.387]  Andrew Kaczynski did not retract it when I got on Twitter, pointed out he was completely wrong.
[03:54:54.747 --> 03:54:56.188]  Didn't retract it, just ignored it.
[03:54:56.948 --> 03:54:58.748]  Nothing happens when they put out their fake news.
[03:54:59.128 --> 03:55:02.789]  And as I document, as I highlighted in my video about a month ago,
[03:55:03.775 --> 03:55:10.320]  Their fake news is way more damaging than some crappy little blog in some fringe obscure corner of the internet.
[03:55:10.580 --> 03:55:13.783]  Their fake news literally starts wars, literally gets people killed.
[03:55:15.264 --> 03:55:17.626]  Why do you think we're in a cold war again with Russia?
[03:55:17.726 --> 03:55:19.007]  Because of their fake news.
[03:55:19.127 --> 03:55:22.029]  And in my country because of fake news about this poison attack.
[03:55:22.390 --> 03:55:25.612]  Their fake news is the most damaging you could ever imagine.
[03:55:26.513 --> 03:55:27.914]  No consequences whatsoever.
[03:55:28.294 --> 03:55:32.778]  Now Malaysia, now these other authoritarian regimes are punishing people
[03:55:33.607 --> 03:55:34.728]  For putting out fake news.
[03:55:35.208 --> 03:55:42.953]  Authoritarian regimes glomming onto that contrived hysteria tells you everything you need to know about the true agenda behind fake news.
[03:55:43.234 --> 03:55:46.196]  The hysteria created by the mainstream media in the first place.
[03:55:47.556 --> 03:55:55.542]  Now, on Twitter earlier, Christian privilege was trending, as well as hashtag lover Muslim.
[03:55:56.337 --> 03:55:58.219]  So we've got Christian privilege trending.
[03:55:58.259 --> 03:56:02.883]  We've got this article out of Campus Reform, I think it is, or College Fix, actually.
[03:56:03.444 --> 03:56:06.667]  University event aims to combat Christian privilege.
[03:56:07.207 --> 03:56:12.332]  George Washington University Diversity Workshop is to be held four days after Easter.
[03:56:12.932 --> 03:56:22.201]  They will host a training session for students and faculty that teaches Christians, especially white ones, because they have to sprinkle a little bit of racism in there too, obviously, as well as anti-Christian bigotry.
[03:56:23.123 --> 03:56:27.026]  Quote, receive unmerited perks from institutions and systems all across our country.
[03:56:27.547 --> 03:56:49.405]  Right, really, so Christian privilege, is that the privilege to be discriminated against, mocked and derided by major academic institutions like George Washington University, by dominant cultural institutions like the entire breadth and width of the social media sphere, Twitter, Facebook, whatever, you've seen the tweets, and the mainstream media which gives them all protection.
[03:56:50.314 --> 03:56:52.484]  Is that what they mean when they talk about Christian privilege?
[03:56:52.545 --> 03:56:54.534]  Or are they talking about the privilege?
[03:56:55.470 --> 03:57:02.936]  Of Christians in Islamic countries, in Middle Eastern countries across the world, who are being persecuted like no other religion on earth.
[03:57:03.036 --> 03:57:05.237]  Is that the Christian privilege they're talking about?
[03:57:05.558 --> 03:57:21.990]  They're talking about Christian slaves being forced to pay jizya tax in these Middle Eastern countries, being killed, being beheaded, being forced to flee the areas in which they've lived for decades and decades, being humiliated and belittled, while all that's happening, by people in the West.
[03:57:22.470 --> 03:57:24.931]  Is that the Christian privilege that you're talking about?
[03:57:25.251 --> 03:57:26.912]  Is that why it's trending on Twitter?
[03:57:27.472 --> 03:57:28.932]  Absolutely disgraced.
[03:57:29.373 --> 03:57:30.313]  I'm not even a Christian.
[03:57:30.653 --> 03:57:33.794]  Christians are the most persecuted religion in the world.
[03:57:34.194 --> 03:57:34.574]  Fact.
[03:57:35.015 --> 03:57:42.077]  And they're belittled, they're ridiculed, they're humiliated at the same time in the West by the dominant cultural institutions, by the media.
[03:57:42.357 --> 03:57:44.158]  Is that your Christian privilege?
[03:57:44.798 --> 03:57:48.700]  That's going to wrap it up for the 4th Hour War Room with Owen Troyer coming up in 4Wars.com.
[03:57:48.780 --> 03:57:49.700]  Now go away.
[03:57:53.596 --> 03:57:58.039]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:57:58.260 --> 03:58:02.963]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:58:03.564 --> 03:58:09.408]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:58:09.828 --> 03:58:22.418]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:58:23.178 --> 03:58:31.885]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:58:31.905 --> 03:58:33.766]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:58:34.106 --> 03:58:35.207]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:58:35.247 --> 03:58:36.548]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:58:36.728 --> 03:58:37.909]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:58:38.109 --> 03:58:39.591]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:58:40.111 --> 03:58:41.713]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:58:41.733 --> 03:58:43.514]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:58:43.875 --> 03:58:46.477]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT science, this and everything else.
[03:58:46.517 --> 03:58:47.378]  This is insane.
[03:58:47.798 --> 03:58:49.400]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:58:49.660 --> 03:58:52.223]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:58:52.663 --> 03:58:54.185]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:58:54.225 --> 03:58:56.047]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:58:56.067 --> 03:58:59.610]  And I said, it's the synergy of it, of the chamomile.
