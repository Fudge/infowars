[00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:17.099]  Long Island, New York knows exactly what Donald Trump meant when he directly referred to MS-13 as animals.
[00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.780]  MS-13 gang members, I know about.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.601]  If they don't reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about them.
[00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.423]  You wouldn't believe how bad these people are.
[00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:27.183]  These aren't people.
[00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.660]  These are animals.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:40.227]  As a panel met for the second time to address the extreme violence perpetrated by this gang of illegal aliens allowed to lurk on the streets of America.
[00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:48.653]  Kayla and Nisa were murdered by MS-13 gang members, many of whom exploited glaring loopholes and we have
[00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:53.510]  The biggest loopholes of any country anywhere in the world.
[00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.220]  We have the worst immigration laws of any country anywhere in the world.
[00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:04.268]  MS-13 is one of the most violent and formidable threats that our country faces today.
[00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:10.032]  MS-13 leaders may operate out of prisons in El Salvador, but the gang is alive and well in our streets.
[00:01:10.032 --> 00:01:13.774]  It is estimated there are 10,000 MS-13 members in the United States.
[00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:17.857]  2,000 are estimated to be right here in Long Island.
[00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:20.219]  And their ranks are continually being refilled.
[00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.841]  With new emissaries from El Salvador.
[00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:29.424]  MS-13 infiltrating our high schools, our middle schools, even our elementary schools.
[00:01:29.424 --> 00:01:35.747]  We have doubled our arrests of MS-13 members under your command, President Trump.
[00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:39.809]  In FY17, the first year, HSI ICE arrested 896 MS-13 leaders, members, and associates.
[00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:49.971]  They arrested another 4,800 total gang members throughout the United States, to include MS-13.
[00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:54.594]  Since FY16, ICE has removed nearly 11,000 criminal gang members.
[00:01:59.517 --> 00:02:01.178]  Specifically about New York.
[00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:07.482]  The target of MS-13 on Long Island is one of the primary goals of ICE because New York is under attack.
[00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:17.487]  With a cooperative focus on sources and intelligence, our ongoing initiative, we arrested in the past year 300 MS-13 criminal arrests here on Long Island.
[00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:21.370]  And more than 40% of those we have verified are unaccompanied alien children.
[00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.210]  So it is a problem.
[00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.331]  There is a connection.
[00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:25.292]  I want to thank everyone for being here.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:40.164]  Mr. President, thank you again for listening to us and our needs in eradicating these 713 individuals.
[00:02:40.164 --> 00:02:46.146]  My daughter Kayla was a beautiful girl.
[00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:51.087]  She had dreams.
[00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:52.288]  And they took that away from her.
[00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:56.127]  That's not right.
[00:02:56.127 --> 00:03:01.198]  And how these kids were murdered, tortured, is unacceptable.
[00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:06.194]  We should not be tolerating this behavior at all whatsoever.
[00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:14.695]  There are people who are in Congress who have pledged to oppose and obstruct everything and anything, saying they cannot work with you because if they work with you, they'll legitimize your presidency.
[00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.336]  You were elected President of the United States.
[00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:17.876]  They were elected to serve in Congress.
[00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:19.036]  They took an oath.
[00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:20.896]  They need to protect our constituents here.
[00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:22.137]  They need to protect their own.
[00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:25.197]  They need to work with you because you're putting your neck out there on the line.
[00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:29.438]  They need to do it as well, even if they're taking a tough vote for their constituents.
[00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.891]  Still, the left is doubling down.
[00:03:33.891 --> 00:03:36.093]  Washington Post columnist E.J.
[00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:41.195]  Dionne recently wrote, It's never right to call other human beings animals.
[00:03:41.195 --> 00:03:43.857]  It's not something we should even have to debate.
[00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:57.084]  No matter how debased the behavior of a given individual or group, no matter how much legitimate anger that genuinely evil actions might inspire, dehumanizing others always leads us down a dangerous path.
[00:03:57.084 --> 00:03:59.726]  Wouldn't not calling them out for what they are
[00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:02.649]  Lead us down an even more dangerous path?
[00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:21.748]  In referring to a White House memo titled, What You Need to Know About the Violent Animals of MS-13, the Southern Poverty Law Center tweeted, It is unacceptable for such racist, dehumanizing language to now be repeated ten times on the White House website in a document that speaks for America.
[00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:25.431]  This is an argument they will clearly never win.
[00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:30.995]  But with more talk like this, it's a midterm election season they will surely lose.
[00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:37.941]  I followed in the footsteps of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, someone whose words have been on my mind recently.
[00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:39.042]  Remember what he said?
[00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:43.085]  Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.
[00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:50.495]  Well, as Democrats, you know, we believe in facts.
[00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:53.558]  And real ones, not the alternative kind.
[00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:56.040]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.933]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:27.927]  Can't you?
[00:06:27.927 --> 00:06:29.928]  We have broken their back!
[00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:34.951]  Yes, I can feel it!
[00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:35.492]  Let's go!

[00:06:46.947 --> 00:06:47.107]  Come on!

[00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:50.369]  Come on!
[00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:50.669]  Come on!
[00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:50.949]  Come on!
[00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:51.149]  Come on!
[00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.350]  Come on!
[00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.590]  Come on!
[00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.830]  Come on!
[00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.070]  Come on!
[00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.250]  Come on!
[00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.490]  Come on!
[00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.770]  Come on!
[00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.971]  Come on!
[00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.191]  Come on!
[00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:53.371]  Come on!
[00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:53.711]  Come on!
[00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:54.211]  Come on!
[00:06:54.211 --> 00:06:54.452]  Come on!
[00:06:54.452 --> 00:06:54.732]  Come on!
[00:06:54.732 --> 00:06:54.972]  Come on!
[00:06:54.972 --> 00:06:55.172]  Come on!
[00:06:55.172 --> 00:06:55.412]  Come on!
[00:06:55.412 --> 00:06:55.692]  Come on!
[00:06:55.692 --> 00:06:56.073]  Come on!
[00:06:56.073 --> 00:06:56.273]  Come on!
[00:06:56.273 --> 00:06:56.473]  Come on!
[00:06:56.473 --> 00:06:56.613]  Come on
[00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:05.862]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:08.928]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:17.156]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:19.739]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:25.324]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:07:25.324 --> 00:07:31.910]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:07:37.355 --> 00:07:43.501]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:47.364]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:07:47.364 --> 00:07:53.490]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.014]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:07:58.014 --> 00:08:03.178]  From the front lines of the info room, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:09.913 --> 00:08:18.655]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, the 24th day already of May 2018.
[00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:27.257]  There is obviously an incredible spectrum of unbelievable news and information.
[00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:33.158]  The big story obviously is the ongoing negotiations with North Korea are proceeding as expected.
[00:08:34.622 --> 00:08:39.584]  The Hawks tried to sabotage the deal via Bolton.
[00:08:39.584 --> 00:08:48.607]  North Korea also started trying to apply pressure to try to wiggle out of private agreements they made months ago.
[00:08:48.607 --> 00:08:52.408]  And so Trump canceled the June 12th meeting.
[00:08:53.832 --> 00:08:57.355]  Of course, I would just expect this to happen in regular negotiation rounds.
[00:08:57.355 --> 00:09:04.941]  North Korea knows it's collapsing under the sanctions, and so they will end up coming back to the table.
[00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:08.865]  They just don't want to do complete total denuclearization up front.
[00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:19.138]  Before they are given more guarantees and some type of treaty agreement, which you have to agree with and I don't like Kim Jong-un as everybody knows.
[00:09:19.138 --> 00:09:32.530]  The whole point is I want to get that communist system off those people's backs and this is the best way moving forward after 60 plus years of this garbage since the United Nations would not let us liberate the
[00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:38.158]  There's a lot of news dealing with Trump releasing the hounds and the fact that
[00:10:04.264 --> 00:10:15.570]  Rosenstein is being drugged before the head of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees privately.
[00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:24.034]  They're talking about appointing a new special counsel, and it certainly doesn't need to be the one-man government, Rosenstein.
[00:10:24.034 --> 00:10:26.856]  It doesn't need to be Sessions.
[00:10:26.856 --> 00:10:32.979]  It needs to be brought forward, I would think, by the House.
[00:10:34.893 --> 00:10:41.115]  And it needs to be recommended because this is a serious constitutional crisis we're already in.
[00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:58.441]  The president has the power and is supposed to remove these individuals, but because he's decided the current calculus, because the media hyped it that way, that if he removes them that he somehow is a criminal when they are the criminals.
[00:10:59.605 --> 00:11:25.758]  Rosenstein undoubtedly is engaged in serious criminal activity and a criminal conspiracy to defraud voters of this country and establish an absolute dictatorship of a cabal of criminals forming a Praetorian Guard coup within the Justice Department and FBI apparatus or put in Central Intelligence Agency parlance, stay behind network, rogue government element
[00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:35.028]  Operating with the most wanton, insane degree of criminal arrogance I've ever seen in any history book.
[00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.370]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.673]  No one would put up with this.
[00:11:39.673 --> 00:11:44.978]  With Schumer and all these other crooks with their tongues hanging out like wild dogs.
[00:11:46.374 --> 00:11:50.417]  Bragging when he was President-elect, we're going to get you, we're going to throw you out.
[00:11:50.417 --> 00:11:52.959]  We've got people in the agencies that aren't going to do what you say.
[00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.581]  We're going to get rid of you.
[00:11:54.581 --> 00:12:01.106]  We're spying on you as a confidence game for all their other crooks.
[00:12:01.106 --> 00:12:04.809]  And now the gas is running out of the tank.
[00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:08.612]  They're way down on E, and the engine's starting to sputter.
[00:12:08.612 --> 00:12:12.916]  And we're in that glide now, where the deep state's running out of gas.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.161]  The engine's popping and spurting and backfiring.
[00:12:19.161 --> 00:12:24.222]  And they're trying to guide it over to the side of the road.
[00:12:24.222 --> 00:12:26.122]  But they're not approaching a shoulder.
[00:12:26.122 --> 00:12:28.563]  They notice they're approaching a cliff.
[00:12:28.563 --> 00:12:31.843]  And they've lost control of their power steering.
[00:12:31.843 --> 00:12:33.784]  And they have that long, sinking feeling.
[00:12:33.784 --> 00:12:37.324]  They're gonna be sliding off the edge.
[00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:39.785]  Down, down, down.
[00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:43.646]  Into the dustbin of history.
[00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:44.926]  I hope they enjoy themselves.
[00:12:46.212 --> 00:12:49.954]  Because they've been pushing so hard.
[00:12:49.954 --> 00:13:00.600]  It means all the normal constraints, because we're a civilized country, are going to be bypassed.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.741]  Because they won't stop and they won't go away.
[00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:10.485]  And the decision has been made in the last two days to remove the rotten teeth.
[00:13:10.485 --> 00:13:13.607]  It's not even going to really take pliers.
[00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:25.739]  It's gonna take the will to reach up with your thumb and your index finger and just grab right up at the top of that rotting gum and just wiggle a little bit and pop it right out.
[00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:37.849]  Let that pus drain out of there.
[00:13:37.849 --> 00:13:40.972]  But it's gonna be bad for some of us that have been at the tip of the spear.
[00:13:40.972 --> 00:13:41.652]  Make no mistake.
[00:13:41.652 --> 00:13:43.434]  But that's what it's all about, isn't it?
[00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:46.032]  That's what freedom is all about.
[00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:50.994]  This civilization has been so soft for so long.
[00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:59.659]  We've been living off the blood, sweat, and tears of ancestors for far too long, and we're going to have to be tested.
[00:13:59.659 --> 00:14:02.200]  And we're going to be tested by the AI computers.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.462]  We're going to be tested by the death panels that the robots run.
[00:14:06.462 --> 00:14:12.866]  We're going to be tested by all the nanotech and bioweapons and all the things that have already gotten loose.
[00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:20.540]  But in the final summation, humanity, I believe, is going to make it.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:28.104]  But folks are going to have to get serious and get their heads screwed on straight to understand we're up against devil worshippers.
[00:14:28.104 --> 00:14:29.424]  That's it.
[00:14:29.424 --> 00:14:30.445]  Period.
[00:14:30.445 --> 00:14:34.086]  I'm going to come back with just masses of news.
[00:14:34.086 --> 00:14:38.909]  On the other side, Weinstein grand jury convened in Harvey Weinstein case in Manhattan.
[00:14:38.909 --> 00:14:41.930]  Federal prosecutor starts sex crimes investigation into Harvey Weinstein.
[00:14:44.062 --> 00:14:48.205]  Raping of women, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:52.107]  Mr. Weinstein is a very sick individual.
[00:14:52.107 --> 00:14:55.710]  He likes to humiliate beautiful women.
[00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.752]  That's what turns him on.
[00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:00.933]  So he's the worst type.
[00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:03.535]  So we're going to be looking at that coming up.
[00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:07.107]  A lot more.
[00:15:07.107 --> 00:15:11.310]  The MS-13 press conference roundtable Trump had at the media to try to censor.
[00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.471]  It's all coming up today.
[00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:21.457]  Please don't forget that I lose the forest for the trees here quite a bit and really don't plug like I should, but that without you funding this operation,
[00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:39.688]  You won't get great products you need, but most importantly, you will not be funding the most energized, focused, vicious spotlight burning in the night like a flamethrower that the devils run up to in the night and want to extinguish, but they can't.
[00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:44.012]  They are definitely throwing as much crap from the woods at us as they can.
[00:15:45.123 --> 00:15:54.016]  And we just need that money to fuel our operations to put bigger, better windshield wipers up there on our big spotlight as we flamethrow them to hell.
[00:15:54.016 --> 00:15:55.217]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:15:55.217 --> 00:15:55.638]  Stay with us.

[00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:57.540]  Telephone for global stations.
[00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:01.658]  Were you born before the year 1956?
[00:16:01.658 --> 00:16:09.724]  If so, did you know you could be collecting between $575 and $2,200 in tax-free income right now?
[00:16:09.724 --> 00:16:11.625]  All thanks to the FHA.
[00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:12.806]  Or what about this?
[00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.727]  Did you know 54 U.S.
[00:16:14.727 --> 00:16:20.531]  congressmen have used a special tax-free account to earn up to 35 times more on their money?
[00:16:20.951 --> 00:16:23.253]  It's true, and you can do it too!
[00:16:23.253 --> 00:16:31.879]  These are just two of the secrets revealed inside a stunning new book from the Palm Beach Research Group and Ted Benne, the man behind the 401K.
[00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:38.144]  You'll discover the 18 best cash cows that can help you earn up to an extra $6,800 a month.

[00:17:03.924 --> 00:17:06.626]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:11.950]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:17.414]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:21.057]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[00:17:21.057 --> 00:17:24.179]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[00:18:30.322 --> 00:18:39.070]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:47.177]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.505]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:25.617 --> 00:20:29.520]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday Global Broadcast.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:38.166]  I do intend to open the phones up today and take your calls on all the big world issues that are taking place.
[00:20:38.166 --> 00:20:53.858]  Do you agree with me that I think we're really starting to turn the tide, at least in the revolution, to restore our Republic and the decision by nation states and individuals around the world to go away from the authoritarian nightmare system that is globalism and its technocracy goal.
[00:20:55.282 --> 00:21:01.326]  We've got Freebloom, always informative to break down his view on what's happening in the UK, Europe, and more.
[00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:08.631]  And also what's happening here in the US, really smart military historian and patriot, who we intend to work with more over in the UK.
[00:21:08.631 --> 00:21:13.174]  And of course, you've got Farage in the background there.
[00:21:13.174 --> 00:21:16.536]  Let's leave it at that.
[00:21:16.536 --> 00:21:17.677]  Wheels within wheels.
[00:21:17.677 --> 00:21:19.638]  And then we've got Anthony Cumia hosting the fourth hour.
[00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:25.089]  Smart guy right there.
[00:21:25.089 --> 00:21:29.792]  So that's coming up.
[00:21:29.792 --> 00:21:36.997]  You know, every day when the show ends I get really mad at myself because I don't at least mention the stuff here.
[00:21:36.997 --> 00:21:50.667]  And despite all this new incredible breaking news, I want to just bring up that we've got embassy personnel in Cuba and China clearly getting hit with microwave guns.
[00:21:52.205 --> 00:22:01.495]  I mean, you can buy sonic weapons on the open market.
[00:22:01.495 --> 00:22:08.763]  And that just shows how ignorant the public is that we bought it somewhere around here about 18 years ago.
[00:22:08.763 --> 00:22:11.987]  I bought a supersonic nauseator of a police catalog.
[00:22:15.845 --> 00:22:16.165]  I don't want
[00:22:34.873 --> 00:22:38.096]  Sonic low-frequency system.
[00:22:38.096 --> 00:22:43.140]  Stuff brain-damaging people's microwave weapons.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.303]  You don't just think the Russians or the Chinese have those, right?
[00:22:46.303 --> 00:22:54.109]  But the point is, is they attacked me the day before for putting out a CIA manual just covering on the air that's public.
[00:22:54.109 --> 00:22:59.614]  And the manual is how they use shell towers.
[00:22:59.614 --> 00:23:00.735]  This is in 1974, the year I was born.
[00:23:02.932 --> 00:23:10.114]  How they were already testing cell towers to control people's emotions.
[00:23:10.114 --> 00:23:18.016]  And it said it can make you get sick, make you convulse, make you die, or just make your skin itch, make your legs kick.
[00:23:18.016 --> 00:23:30.639]  So, the left, the left made big jokes about that, but there's the State Department saying, we take the use of these weapons against us very seriously.
[00:23:30.639 --> 00:23:31.679]  That's the CNN headline.
[00:23:32.622 --> 00:23:36.805]  But then meanwhile, there's an article from the day before making fun of us for pointing it out.
[00:23:36.805 --> 00:23:45.632]  They just don't want us pointing out that the sky is blue or that birds fly around in it.
[00:23:45.632 --> 00:23:47.314]  So the State Department has issued a warning.
[00:23:47.314 --> 00:23:49.876]  They may have to basically close their embassy in China because of this.
[00:23:51.109 --> 00:23:57.710]  And of course it was declassified in the 80s, that in the 60s and 70s the Russians were hitting U.S.
[00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:07.692]  Embassy staff with this stuff, and they made the decision to not even tell the people at the Embassy to see if it worked.
[00:24:07.692 --> 00:24:09.673]  And that was all on my stack yesterday.
[00:24:09.673 --> 00:24:11.813]  It was from .gov.
[00:24:11.813 --> 00:24:15.274]  It was the big national institute on
[00:24:18.991 --> 00:24:23.393]  Biological developments in the human system out of DARPA.
[00:24:23.393 --> 00:24:28.876]  And that's what's so frustrating about this is there's a world government.
[00:24:28.876 --> 00:24:29.756]  It's totally corrupt.
[00:24:29.756 --> 00:24:33.418]  It's coming for you and your family.
[00:24:33.418 --> 00:24:39.841]  They know the 5G gives you brain cancer really fast and heart attacks.
[00:24:39.841 --> 00:24:46.103]  Understand this isn't my opinion.
[00:24:46.103 --> 00:24:46.844]  They know all this.
[00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:48.982]  So, I'm trying to explain.
[00:24:48.982 --> 00:24:50.403]  We are being hit.
[00:24:50.403 --> 00:25:02.373]  They are making it ubiquitous with weapon systems everywhere that are frying the population.
[00:25:02.373 --> 00:25:08.237]  You can just go to a search engine and type in Sonic Weapons U.S.
[00:25:08.237 --> 00:25:11.280]  Embassies.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.723]  Now, they don't want to tell you that it's not sonic attacks.
[00:25:14.723 --> 00:25:16.264]  It's microwave attacks.
[00:25:18.413 --> 00:25:19.274]  What is a cell tower?
[00:25:19.274 --> 00:25:20.115]  What is a cell phone?
[00:25:20.115 --> 00:25:23.438]  It is a microwave.
[00:25:23.438 --> 00:25:25.681]  So notice, no one's been covering this.
[00:25:25.681 --> 00:25:28.704]  I have been hammering this for years, particularly this last month.
[00:25:28.704 --> 00:25:31.707]  I was like, I haven't hammered on that in a few months.
[00:25:31.707 --> 00:25:32.608]  I'm going to really bring it back.
[00:25:32.608 --> 00:25:35.010]  And I've been hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering.
[00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.553]  Just as a public service announcement.
[00:25:37.553 --> 00:25:40.536]  Hey, we've got a leech who admit
[00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:54.179]  In the Baltimore Sun, 18 years ago, I'll never forget, they said, oh, we're testing the local Baltimore cell towers, DARPA is, to see if we can calm the public during the summer months.
[00:25:54.179 --> 00:25:59.502]  And so, yes, the CIA is in Baltimore, and that was a test article to see what would happen.
[00:25:59.502 --> 00:26:03.323]  No one covered it but us, other than the Baltimore Sun.
[00:26:03.323 --> 00:26:09.666]  Saying, this summer during the hot months, to see if we can help people, we're gonna just send out calming waves over the cell towers.
[00:26:11.141 --> 00:26:18.925]  And then they have little articles on Fox News, oh, Japan looks at putting lithium in their water, and we're looking at it too.
[00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:21.907]  They don't look at doing it.
[00:26:21.907 --> 00:26:24.148]  Many water supplies have lithium added to it.
[00:26:24.148 --> 00:26:33.573]  You know, I talked to one of the high-level technicians, engineers, who set up in Singapore.
[00:26:33.573 --> 00:26:37.695]  He's a big Republican Party guy here in Texas.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:27:04.457]  And he told me, this is about 19 years ago, how they have different ports in the subterranean water system of Singapore, because the scientists, doctors, ended up creating, since Singapore is a big MI6 think tank, and that they put the different drugs in in Singapore just to test it on the public.
[00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:04.997]  Think about that.
[00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.829]  That's what's going on.
[00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.490]  They've tested the water all over the U.S.
[00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:17.191]  and it's got levels of drugs in it that's impossible from runoff.
[00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:25.854]  And then they test it and it's not even, again, Luvox or Prozac or some different molecular manipulation of a fluoride molecule.
[00:27:25.854 --> 00:27:33.097]  It is a generic, super strong Prozac that is put in the water.
[00:27:33.097 --> 00:27:36.618]  The tap water you're given has Prozac put in it.
[00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:46.103]  It shipped in from China, or it shipped in from Florida in the bags, and it just says, oh, hydrofluoric acid.
[00:27:46.103 --> 00:28:02.471]  But under federal law, it can have hundreds of other grignard reagents, toxins, you name it, and in it is the Prozac.
[00:28:02.471 --> 00:28:04.892]  You're not in Kansas anymore, folks.
[00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:05.813]  And that's all I'm telling you.
[00:28:08.216 --> 00:28:12.980]  100% we're being microwaved to death and the cancer rates are going straight up.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.181]  Straight up!
[00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:19.725]  Straight up!
[00:28:19.725 --> 00:28:20.866]  Now there's your London Guardian.
[00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:21.626]  Stay calm everyone.
[00:28:21.626 --> 00:28:25.790]  There's Prozac in the water and there's so much of it running off out of the Mississippi.
[00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.192]  It drains, you know, half the water in the country or more.
[00:28:29.827 --> 00:28:32.768]  That the fish are suicidal.
[00:28:32.768 --> 00:28:33.788]  The shrimp are suicidal.
[00:28:33.788 --> 00:28:35.668]  That's mainstream headlines.
[00:28:35.668 --> 00:28:36.748]  And you go, how are they suicidal?
[00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:46.890]  Little fish swim right up to the pelicans.
[00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:53.352]  And you know, the Bible says that an off-world entity fell onto the planet and enjoys killing us.
[00:28:53.352 --> 00:28:55.192]  You know, I start to think that Bible might be accurate.
[00:28:59.358 --> 00:29:02.882]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[00:29:02.882 --> 00:29:05.104]  Fire your stockbroker and hire yourself.
[00:29:05.104 --> 00:29:09.108]  I'm Scott Bauer and I've been a professional trader for over 25 years.
[00:29:09.108 --> 00:29:14.433]  I've traded for Goldman Sachs and was the first Amazon market maker at the Chicago Board Options Exchange.
[00:29:14.433 --> 00:29:21.120]  I'm also the CEO here at Prosper Trading Academy, the leading educational firm teaching people how to trade the markets.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:29.783]  For a limited time I'm giving away one of my favorite secret trading techniques used by thousands of our students every day to help build their financial future.
[00:29:29.783 --> 00:29:35.265]  To learn this technique right now, call my 24-7 voicemail and just leave your email address.

[00:29:38.246 --> 00:29:38.806]  Just call 1-800-228-2155.
[00:29:41.647 --> 00:29:46.790]  This is the very information my students use every day to invest in their financial future.
[00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:53.655]  Again, call 1-800-228-2155 in the next 30 minutes and leave your email address on my voicemail.
[00:29:53.655 --> 00:29:53.995]  That's 1-800-228-2155.
[00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:54.155]  Call 1-800-228-2155.
[00:30:00.578 --> 00:30:06.162]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[00:30:06.162 --> 00:30:07.023]  It'd take hours.
[00:30:07.023 --> 00:30:09.465]  Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:30:09.465 --> 00:30:10.646]  It's stronger.
[00:30:10.646 --> 00:30:12.267]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:30:12.267 --> 00:30:15.489]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:30:15.489 --> 00:30:16.610]  It's back in stock.
[00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.773]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:30:19.773 --> 00:30:23.556]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:26.658]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:27.559]  So you can upload it.
[00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.000]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.202]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:31:00.123 --> 00:31:03.727]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:31:03.727 --> 00:31:05.509]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:16.780]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:31:17.541 --> 00:31:26.727]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:31:26.727 --> 00:31:37.793]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:31:37.793 --> 00:31:40.415]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:31:40.415 --> 00:31:42.136]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:31:42.136 --> 00:31:46.939]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:52.102]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:31:52.102 --> 00:31:54.764]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:31:54.764 --> 00:31:59.468]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.

[00:33:03.923 --> 00:33:06.605]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.098 --> 00:33:14.185]  We are drugged out.
[00:33:14.185 --> 00:33:16.452]  We are following other people's opinions.
[00:33:17.609 --> 00:33:20.410]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.270]  Today, it all changes.
[00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:25.031]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:33:25.031 --> 00:33:27.892]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:33:27.892 --> 00:33:32.833]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:33:32.833 --> 00:33:35.954]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:33:35.954 --> 00:33:38.194]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:33:38.194 --> 00:33:40.775]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:33:40.775 --> 00:33:42.416]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:33:42.416 --> 00:33:43.696]  We have the resources.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.524]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[00:33:50.524 --> 00:33:51.966]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:33:51.966 --> 00:33:53.587]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:33:53.587 --> 00:33:54.649]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:55.730]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.132]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:33:58.132 --> 00:34:03.277]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:34:03.277 --> 00:34:07.422]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:07.422 --> 00:34:09.183]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:15.689 --> 00:34:20.731]  It's a bigger plan.
[00:34:20.731 --> 00:34:22.152]  We're going to follow the devil's plan?
[00:34:22.152 --> 00:34:29.936]  Because whether you think the devil's real or not, the spirit running this world system is super evil.
[00:34:29.936 --> 00:34:30.956]  It doesn't even want power.
[00:34:30.956 --> 00:34:38.560]  It wants to hurt you, twist you, poison you, bring you down, and then kill you.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.760]  You like that plan?
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.701]  Or you like the bigger plan?
[00:34:42.701 --> 00:34:43.702]  It's real big.
[00:34:44.807 --> 00:34:49.108]  This is only level one.
[00:34:49.108 --> 00:34:56.549]  Now all the scientists know that, the quantum mechanics, the heads of the big banks come out and say, this is a virtual reality.
[00:34:56.549 --> 00:35:09.732]  All the spectrometers, all the special devices have picked it up that the black matter, the dark matter is molecularly even more dense than our universe and that everything is being held together.
[00:35:12.495 --> 00:35:28.924]  And that there is outside stimuli, and they've even proven scientifically, if you look at a star through a telescope, that it then has a energy relay between you and the star.
[00:35:28.924 --> 00:35:30.425]  Everything is interdimensional.
[00:35:30.425 --> 00:35:41.692]  There was a physicist, French physicist, I forget his name, saw a PBS documentary on it back when there was actually interesting things on there, and they predicted that when one of the first probes flew over
[00:35:42.793 --> 00:36:06.467]  The gas giant Saturn, that there would be a pentagon, or a hexagon, inter-dimensionally projected into the pole, and that the ice storm, ice gas storm, would manifest it.
[00:36:06.467 --> 00:36:09.789]  And when the probe went over, there it was.
[00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:10.970]  No one had ever seen the top of it.
[00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:19.949]  That is how powerful our brains are.
[00:36:19.949 --> 00:36:23.572]  We envisioned all of this and built it.
[00:36:23.572 --> 00:36:27.695]  The Bible says we're made in the image of God.
[00:36:27.695 --> 00:36:31.318]  Made in the image.
[00:36:31.318 --> 00:36:31.719]  Image.
[00:36:31.719 --> 00:36:33.320]  What does that mean?
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.402]  Like a 3D image.
[00:36:35.402 --> 00:36:36.723]  The data in the image.
[00:36:36.723 --> 00:36:39.765]  It has to be unlocked.
[00:36:39.765 --> 00:36:43.048]  You are the image.
[00:36:43.048 --> 00:36:44.709]  The potential.
[00:36:44.709 --> 00:36:45.230]  The seed.
[00:36:51.138 --> 00:36:56.702]  And there's a force that wants to hijack your consciousness and destroy you.
[00:36:56.702 --> 00:37:08.049]  Because in the universe, if there's free will, then there has to be that bad thing.
[00:37:08.049 --> 00:37:09.050]  That's the nature of it.
[00:37:13.507 --> 00:37:24.136]  And everything world government and the globalists are doing is to dumb us down, poison us, turn us against each other, and kill us.
[00:37:24.136 --> 00:37:25.497]  You like that plan?
[00:37:25.497 --> 00:37:26.958]  I don't like that plan.
[00:37:26.958 --> 00:37:29.660]  I'm against that plan.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.282]  I'm for the bigger plan.
[00:37:32.282 --> 00:37:36.526]  Can we play that Kanye West little promo piece one more time?
[00:37:36.526 --> 00:37:42.951]  Let's play that little promo piece one more time so people can hear what he's saying.
[00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:46.934]  Super strong words being spoken.
[00:37:46.934 --> 00:37:47.795]  Pure truth.
[00:37:47.795 --> 00:37:52.181]  Here it is.
[00:37:52.181 --> 00:37:54.264]  We are drugs out!
[00:37:54.264 --> 00:37:56.487]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:37:57.637 --> 00:38:00.459]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:38:00.459 --> 00:38:02.320]  Today it all changes.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.802]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:38:04.802 --> 00:38:06.103]  It is a choice.
[00:38:06.103 --> 00:38:08.164]  Just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:38:08.164 --> 00:38:12.907]  Einstein said the death and insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[00:38:12.907 --> 00:38:16.009]  So we keep on saying I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:38:16.009 --> 00:38:18.751]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:38:18.751 --> 00:38:20.812]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:38:20.812 --> 00:38:22.473]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:38:22.473 --> 00:38:23.094]  We have the
[00:38:26.923 --> 00:38:30.586]  Sometimes you need some crazy mother****** to change something.
[00:38:30.586 --> 00:38:32.027]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:38:32.027 --> 00:38:33.629]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phone.
[00:38:33.629 --> 00:38:34.710]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.791]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:38:35.791 --> 00:38:38.173]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:38:38.173 --> 00:38:43.397]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:38:43.397 --> 00:38:47.440]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.163]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:38:50.163 --> 00:38:51.404]  It's a bigger plan.
[00:38:54.375 --> 00:39:01.917]  I'm just doing what the universe told me, not the earth.
[00:39:01.917 --> 00:39:04.477]  In the earth, not of it.
[00:39:04.477 --> 00:39:08.758]  I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:39:08.758 --> 00:39:18.500]  Not Hollywood and Times Square, all their false reality trying to keep you in it, trying to put blinders on you, trying to make you put VR goggles on.
[00:39:21.912 --> 00:39:26.033]  So that you don't look up and then you're gone already.
[00:39:26.033 --> 00:39:30.215]  Your body's still here, but you're already outside their grasp.
[00:39:30.215 --> 00:39:51.561]  Doesn't mean they can't still hurt your body, doesn't mean they can't still torture your soul because you love your family, but once you understand it's all real and timeless and we do not die, and that your energy is going to resonate with Hillary and Weinstein and the devil worshippers, you're going to choose to be separated and go into that or into the universe, into the next level.
[00:39:54.209 --> 00:39:59.631]  That's right outside the projected universe you see.
[00:39:59.631 --> 00:40:02.712]  Just waiting.
[00:40:02.712 --> 00:40:04.853]  The doors are waiting.
[00:40:04.853 --> 00:40:07.614]  They're right there.
[00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:18.337]  Spiritual teleportation.
[00:40:18.337 --> 00:40:23.559]  Sick, evil, twisted destruction only wants to pull you down.
[00:40:26.727 --> 00:40:36.673]  And you cannot serve this world, you cannot be in love with this world, you cannot be in love with power or things and ever transcend.
[00:40:36.673 --> 00:40:42.497]  And it doesn't mean you don't like a car that runs well or enjoy nice food or whatever, but it's not your God.
[00:40:42.497 --> 00:40:55.966]  And if somebody tells you to enslave somebody or dumb somebody down just so you get something, you're going to resonate with the satanic energy
[00:40:57.301 --> 00:41:01.842]  And you're going to fall.
[00:41:01.842 --> 00:41:03.563]  It's that simple.
[00:41:03.563 --> 00:41:07.744]  And it's very alluring, makes you feel strong, makes you think you're in charge while you're here!
[00:41:07.744 --> 00:41:16.767]  This is all that matters right now, this planet?
[00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:22.389]  This planet is phase one, and everybody in every culture and every system knows that.
[00:41:22.389 --> 00:41:23.029]  Because it is.
[00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:25.088]  You're like, oh really?
[00:41:25.088 --> 00:41:28.649]  A spaceport and like we're in the universe and all.
[00:41:28.649 --> 00:41:29.470]  Yeah, we are!
[00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:30.970]  Look around you!
[00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:35.331]  Couldn't be more fantastic!
[00:41:35.331 --> 00:41:38.813]  And it's real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:38.813 --> 00:41:49.876]  It's so real that the totally advanced, complete, omnipresent entity that created it built what you can see just like that.
[00:41:51.445 --> 00:41:55.987]  To experience consciousness and free will through us.
[00:41:55.987 --> 00:42:05.351]  An extension, not the Godhead, but an extension of God's consciousness.
[00:42:05.351 --> 00:42:07.572]  God's dream.
[00:42:07.572 --> 00:42:11.074]  God's breath.
[00:42:11.074 --> 00:42:12.394]  Feeling it.
[00:42:12.394 --> 00:42:13.435]  Entering it.
[00:42:13.435 --> 00:42:17.477]  Becoming it.
[00:42:17.477 --> 00:42:18.217]  The presence of it.
[00:42:23.373 --> 00:42:29.116]  And then you just say, how on earth are we run by these fallen demonic globalists?
[00:42:29.116 --> 00:42:34.118]  People are like, oh they're powerful!
[00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:43.283]  Only because they're willing to violate all the galactic rules to set themselves up in a hierarchical system to dominate and control us.
[00:42:43.283 --> 00:42:45.044]  While they claim they're against hierarchy,
[00:42:46.749 --> 00:42:48.651]  And they claim they're all about collectives.
[00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:49.772]  They're the opposite.
[00:42:49.772 --> 00:42:52.155]  We'll be back with the key transmission.
[00:42:52.155 --> 00:42:53.537]  Stay with us.
[00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:57.121]  This is the broadcast that Satan's emissary Soros fears.

[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:13.172 --> 00:47:15.814]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:15.814 --> 00:47:22.617]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:47:22.617 --> 00:47:29.861]  That's right, old World War II saying, you know you're over the target when you're getting the flack.
[00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:30.862]  How many guns?
[00:47:30.862 --> 00:47:32.763]  I'd say about 10,000.
[00:47:32.763 --> 00:47:34.484]  Some on the surface, some on the towers.
[00:47:39.466 --> 00:47:41.427]  In through and beyond.
[00:47:41.427 --> 00:47:48.390]  Alright, I've gone metaphysical here because that's the key to all this, but at the same time I should mention some of the stuff coming up.
[00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.250]  We're going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:54.812]  Godfrey Bloom's coming up.
[00:47:54.812 --> 00:48:02.615]  I got a bunch of CIA documents I want to get into from 1967 when they invented the word conspiracy theory.
[00:48:02.615 --> 00:48:03.895]  This is mainstream news.
[00:48:03.895 --> 00:48:04.736]  People just forget this.
[00:48:05.942 --> 00:48:14.707]  You've got to get an inside scoop on how all this works, because you know most of the people doing this stuff don't even like what they're doing.
[00:48:14.707 --> 00:48:22.912]  That's why they've got to create some culture of men hating women and women hating men and racial hatred, because that's the only culture.
[00:48:22.912 --> 00:48:31.877]  The globalist that they can create is one of hate and everybody fighting with each other to then compartmentalize groups and different systems so that people will do mean things to each other.
[00:48:31.877 --> 00:48:32.798]  That's basically what's going on.
[00:48:33.717 --> 00:48:38.901]  Now, when I sit here and I say there's censorship going on, we all know it, it's now admitted.
[00:48:38.901 --> 00:48:45.806]  But then the media will sit there and go, oh, a judge ruled that Trump can't censor his Twitter feed.
[00:48:45.806 --> 00:48:50.069]  Well, that just shows that the judge doesn't understand how it works or is a globalist, probably both.
[00:48:50.069 --> 00:49:03.299]  Because being ignorant goes with serving the architect of this pathetic, hijacking the little plan, not the plan.
[00:49:05.386 --> 00:49:06.007]  The plan?
[00:49:06.007 --> 00:49:09.731]  Okay.
[00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:22.066]  Anyways, Twitter can place its bots and its fake avatars at the top and force feed down your throat, whatever they want, and they already put at the top
[00:49:23.807 --> 00:49:30.470]  of Trump's feed, the haters, and then bury all the good stuff where he's going through news and see what you have to say at the bottom.
[00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:32.971]  And they've been caught blocking the push notifications.
[00:49:32.971 --> 00:49:37.373]  We are the only people that have done videos on this.
[00:49:37.373 --> 00:49:40.414]  We need to have someone brief the president on this.
[00:49:40.414 --> 00:49:42.615]  I've tried to tell him.
[00:49:42.615 --> 00:49:47.757]  A few times I've gotten to talk and say something to him.
[00:49:47.757 --> 00:49:48.938]  He doesn't understand it.
[00:49:48.938 --> 00:49:51.759]  He's got people around him that don't understand it or lying to him about it.
[00:49:52.895 --> 00:49:54.998]  Because these worldly people are all very lazy, folks.
[00:49:54.998 --> 00:49:55.639]  They do the minimum.
[00:49:55.639 --> 00:49:57.121]  They don't really want knowledge.
[00:49:57.121 --> 00:50:02.409]  They just act like they have knowledge, and then they've got technocrats behind the scenes that are all very specialized, but they're 200 IQs.
[00:50:07.458 --> 00:50:09.799]  And they build these systems.
[00:50:09.799 --> 00:50:20.742]  But, oh, Trump censoring Twitter when he has people pegged to the top, saying lies, spewing garbage, trying to make it look like he's not popular.
[00:50:20.742 --> 00:50:28.003]  And the judge goes, it's an electronic town hall, so you've got to let people on it.
[00:50:28.003 --> 00:50:30.284]  Well, and folks are going, oh, that's a victory for conservatives.
[00:50:30.284 --> 00:50:31.444]  They're admitting it's a town hall.
[00:50:31.444 --> 00:50:32.625]  They're admitting it's a utility.
[00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:35.990]  You can't stop people.
[00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.651]  They're going to selectively enforce it.
[00:50:37.651 --> 00:50:38.832]  It's how they do it.
[00:50:38.832 --> 00:50:43.975]  And that's the whole game.
[00:50:43.975 --> 00:50:53.621]  But if we can just let the president understand how that works and how they're in his Twitter.
[00:50:53.621 --> 00:50:58.404]  Remember, Jack Dorsey said, I might just ban him for the mean things, he says.
[00:50:58.404 --> 00:51:02.647]  Meanwhile, they got people on Twitter saying kill him with millions of followers, and they're allowed to say it.
[00:51:06.724 --> 00:51:09.707]  So that ties into this constellation of news.
[00:51:09.707 --> 00:51:16.112]  How can we hope to keep our republic when one of the parties is totally committed to tyranny and evil?
[00:51:16.112 --> 00:51:18.955]  It's a good article from Town Hall.
[00:51:18.955 --> 00:51:23.979]  But it ties into this, and I could spend five hours on this one subject alone.
[00:51:23.979 --> 00:51:28.303]  Jesus banned from Illinois high school
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.544]  Valedictorian warned not to use the word or he would lose his diploma.
[00:51:33.544 --> 00:51:34.645]  He's considering a lawsuit.
[00:51:34.645 --> 00:51:38.728]  It's in a Don Salazar Infowars.com article.
[00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:41.471]  And I can't believe that this even has to be debated.
[00:51:41.471 --> 00:51:45.615]  We'll play a clip in a moment from CBS News Local.
[00:51:45.615 --> 00:51:47.356]  They sit there going, is it right?
[00:51:47.356 --> 00:51:48.077]  Should it be banned?
[00:51:48.077 --> 00:51:49.338]  Separation of church and state.
[00:51:49.338 --> 00:51:54.623]  Separation of church and state means you can't have the state government or the federal government have an official religion.
[00:51:55.791 --> 00:52:03.837]  It doesn't mean that he can't get up, if that's part of the process, and say whatever he wants under the First Amendment.
[00:52:03.837 --> 00:52:09.341]  Because Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:52:09.341 --> 00:52:11.363]  That is the first part of the First Amendment.
[00:52:11.363 --> 00:52:12.103]  Then the press.
[00:52:12.103 --> 00:52:12.804]  Then assembly.
[00:52:12.804 --> 00:52:13.885]  Then petitioning.
[00:52:13.885 --> 00:52:15.666]  Then redress of grievances.
[00:52:15.666 --> 00:52:17.727]  Then the marching.
[00:52:17.727 --> 00:52:21.790]  But the left interprets all of what it is for us now, and they're the biggest enemy.
[00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.993]  The left set itself up in the last 50 years as the guardian of free speech.
[00:52:26.325 --> 00:52:30.266]  But only so they could define what free speech was.
[00:52:30.266 --> 00:52:33.747]  Now they are the executioner of free speech.
[00:52:33.747 --> 00:52:36.268]  The friend that's always been so close to it.
[00:52:36.268 --> 00:52:40.009]  And all over the country, you see the articles every few days around Christmas.
[00:52:40.009 --> 00:52:47.571]  Oh, Texas school suspends a student for giving out Christmas cards because they said Christmas.
[00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:55.914]  You could hand out baseball cards, you could hand out Satanism cards, you could hand out Harry Potter cards, but you do not hand out Christmas cards.
[00:52:57.506 --> 00:53:01.728]  You see, and they dilute it, and they attack it, and then they have debates.
[00:53:01.728 --> 00:53:05.350]  Oh, it... Does it violate his rights?
[00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:05.970]  Does it?
[00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:15.695]  When anyone who knows what this country's set up on... See, the right wing always attacks Thomas Jefferson and goes, he wanted to ban religion or ban it in schools.
[00:53:15.695 --> 00:53:17.076]  No, he didn't.
[00:53:17.076 --> 00:53:19.537]  He didn't want a religious cult over the country.
[00:53:19.537 --> 00:53:20.258]  We've seen that enough.
[00:53:21.533 --> 00:53:29.895]  And so he said, you will not have a government-controlled, prescribed denomination where the government says, this is your church, and the only church allowed.
[00:53:29.895 --> 00:53:34.656]  They've had five civil wars.
[00:53:34.656 --> 00:53:36.137]  Two big ones in England over that.
[00:53:36.137 --> 00:53:39.037]  They've had probably a hundred civil wars in Europe.
[00:53:39.037 --> 00:53:42.378]  I mean, we're talking four, five, six, seven per country.
[00:53:42.378 --> 00:53:44.779]  Millions dead for 500 years.
[00:53:47.964 --> 00:53:55.428]  Before Thomas Jefferson said separation of church and state in a letter interpreting the Constitution and the First Amendment.
[00:53:55.428 --> 00:53:59.890]  And these people misrepresent because they think you're stupid.
[00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:02.451]  Think about that in America.
[00:54:02.451 --> 00:54:05.193]  China says you can't say Jesus.
[00:54:05.193 --> 00:54:08.534]  This is what's happening in America.
[00:54:08.534 --> 00:54:11.716]  And Elon Musk comes out and says that, you know, people don't trust the media.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.421]  That's why Trump got elected.
[00:54:14.421 --> 00:54:21.684]  He says they're all arrogant, they're out of control, they're a fraud, they lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie.
[00:54:21.684 --> 00:54:25.526]  Yeah, he gets it.
[00:54:25.526 --> 00:54:27.987]  There's a revolution against these liars happening.
[00:54:27.987 --> 00:54:28.647]  Oh, look!
[00:54:28.647 --> 00:54:32.529]  Conservative comedians announce comedy tour gets censored by Facebook.
[00:54:32.529 --> 00:54:35.150]  That was on The War Room last night.
[00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.612]  Twitter censors push notifications for President Trump.
[00:54:37.612 --> 00:54:41.033]  We are the only site that ever covered that.
[00:54:41.033 --> 00:54:42.394]  That should be everywhere.
[00:54:44.258 --> 00:54:46.440]  There should be an intelligence briefing.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.063]  In fact, I'll write it to the President about how he's being censored, how he's being controlled.
[00:54:51.063 --> 00:54:57.327]  And then, we've got to get that to him.
[00:54:57.327 --> 00:54:59.449]  Maybe through Chris Ruddy or somebody.
[00:55:05.421 --> 00:55:07.962]  They are so scared if he gets the information.
[00:55:07.962 --> 00:55:11.985]  His instincts and everything are already so good, if we could just brief the President.
[00:55:11.985 --> 00:55:15.247]  That's why they fear it so much, why Infowars is banned in the White House.
[00:55:15.247 --> 00:55:21.370]  Alright, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:22.331]  I need to be funded.
[00:55:22.331 --> 00:55:23.632]  This operation needs to be funded.
[00:55:23.632 --> 00:55:27.134]  I have not even done what I should be doing here on air plugging.
[00:55:28.463 --> 00:55:41.056]  You know we're doing world-changing things here, and I decided, because we did this last year, I was looking back at the calendar a few weeks ago, and I noticed that last Memorial Day we did some of the biggest specials of the year, so we're doing it right now.
[00:55:41.056 --> 00:55:45.120]  A huge raft of specials, great products, chance for you to try them out.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.242]  Memorial Day Patriots Special!

[00:55:58.679 --> 00:56:03.961]  There are formulas that aren't even as good that retail for $60.

[00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:16.225]  X2 and BioTruth Selenium, 50% off combo.
[00:56:16.225 --> 00:56:18.026]  I was misreading the special here today.
[00:56:18.026 --> 00:56:18.246]  It was
[00:56:19.708 --> 00:56:21.669]  50% off on Selenium when you got X2.
[00:56:21.669 --> 00:56:23.450]  So I've, uh, that was a mistake.
[00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:25.451]  So we've actually changed it to what I said.
[00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:29.513]  X2 is now 50% off when you get it with a bottle of Selenium.
[00:56:29.513 --> 00:56:30.673]  That's also 50% off.
[00:56:30.673 --> 00:56:33.455]  So both are 50% off in that combo now.

[00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:42.162]  Planetary death.
[00:57:42.162 --> 00:57:43.083]  That's it.
[00:57:43.083 --> 00:57:44.804]  This is planetary death we're fighting.
[00:57:44.804 --> 00:57:47.487]  Find our operation and we will rampage forward.
[00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:59.049]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:59.049 --> 00:58:06.916]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:10.079]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.

[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.040]  Overkill.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:25.501]  Enough is enough.
[01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:42.304]  We're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:42.304 --> 01:00:44.505]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:44.505 --> 01:00:45.885]  I'm going to reveal
[01:00:47.313 --> 01:00:58.800]  The true profile and the blueprint for mass shootings in this country.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.604]  The police, the FBI, they've known this since Columbine.
[01:01:05.604 --> 01:01:06.765]  We know it.
[01:01:06.765 --> 01:01:09.887]  The corporate media struggles night and day to keep it from you.
[01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:15.983]  You can talk about the shootings happening in blue state areas every time.
[01:01:15.983 --> 01:01:19.224]  You can talk about how they're always on psychotropic drugs, they're in a shoot-em-up video games.
[01:01:19.224 --> 01:01:27.306]  You can always talk about how there's police stand-downs.
[01:01:27.306 --> 01:01:31.728]  I wanted to think Texas would be different, but they're saying 30 minutes until they took the guy out.
[01:01:31.728 --> 01:01:34.169]  Now, he did shoot the school resource officer first.
[01:01:34.169 --> 01:01:34.869]  He was waiting on him.
[01:01:37.506 --> 01:01:39.887]  But I just, I just find that hard to believe.
[01:01:39.887 --> 01:01:44.190]  But ladies and gentlemen, we know the profile.
[01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:54.076]  In every case the school mass shooters are incels.
[01:01:54.076 --> 01:01:58.439]  Involuntarily celibate.
[01:01:58.439 --> 01:02:01.781]  That's what happened with both of the shooters at Columbine.
[01:02:02.825 --> 01:02:10.347]  It's the cutout of every single one of these individuals and every single school shooting.
[01:02:10.347 --> 01:02:16.128]  Elliot Rodger is where we get the name.
[01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:19.648]  Incel.
[01:02:19.648 --> 01:02:25.690]  But the truck attack up in Toronto, an incel, said he was an incel, liked Elliot Rodger.
[01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:31.571]  They are pseudo-autistic males, generally white, in fact almost always.
[01:02:33.254 --> 01:02:35.776]  They have high IQs.
[01:02:35.776 --> 01:02:40.039]  They're in love with themselves, in love with the potential of what they could be.
[01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.117]  The potential in all of us is great.
[01:02:43.117 --> 01:02:47.859]  So they're in love with the idea of their potential but aren't willing to actually execute it.
[01:02:47.859 --> 01:02:59.921]  And so you have a propulsion system by the time you're 10, 11, 12 years old to want to leave the nest and to feel like you're not having worth and that you would have worth, but usually you want your parents to do it for you and you want to run somebody else's life.
[01:02:59.921 --> 01:03:01.142]  It's an immaturity thing.
[01:03:01.142 --> 01:03:01.882]  That's what liberals are.
[01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:05.102]  They all want to run your life, but they can't run theirs.
[01:03:05.102 --> 01:03:07.103]  So it's an extension of liberal mental illness.
[01:03:08.376 --> 01:03:24.173]  And then you add shoot-em-up video games, and you add weapons, and you add serotonin reuptake inhibitors, because mommy sends you to the psychiatrist, the psychologist, because you got problems, and you're acting out.
[01:03:24.173 --> 01:03:24.453]  And then,
[01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:40.023]  You identify with the ball starting rolling with Columbine in 1999 and all the attention and everything and it's a romanticism about you and selfishness.
[01:03:40.023 --> 01:03:47.126]  It's a true act of Satanism to ruin other people's lives, to ruin their family's lives, to hurt them.
[01:03:47.126 --> 01:03:52.109]  And they do it because a girl they have a crush on rejects them.
[01:03:56.038 --> 01:04:04.746]  And it really comes down to when they smarted off and they didn't work hard and mommy did whatever and daddy wasn't at home that nobody knocked him upside the head.
[01:04:04.746 --> 01:04:08.030]  Because they never went through any type of real tribulation.
[01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:18.400]  So they build this tribulation for themselves, this battle of the gods, this Ragnarok final destiny to basically commit suicide to their life.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.282]  And we know who they are, we know how to stop them, we know how to get them.
[01:04:23.282 --> 01:04:33.369]  They're always wearing swastikas, they're always wearing iron communism regalia, devil worship, black, their clothing, they are satanist.
[01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:38.332]  They are spoiled, cowardly, stupid, ruined, little mini devils.
[01:04:38.332 --> 01:04:40.694]  It's like Satan wants to blow the planet up.
[01:04:40.694 --> 01:04:41.815]  He is an incel.
[01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:44.416]  Satan is an incel.
[01:04:44.416 --> 01:04:46.478]  This is absolutely critical.
[01:04:46.478 --> 01:04:48.119]  Satan is an incel.
[01:04:49.224 --> 01:04:53.605]  Satan is a failure, and Satan wants to take us all with it.
[01:04:53.605 --> 01:04:58.247]  That is the key.
[01:04:58.247 --> 01:05:17.092]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding
[01:05:17.432 --> 01:05:18.212]  The revolution.
[01:05:18.212 --> 01:05:20.334]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.334 --> 01:05:24.335]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:24.335 --> 01:05:31.599]  And I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:33.980]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.

[01:05:36.622 --> 01:05:37.422]  That's my dad.
[01:05:37.422 --> 01:05:39.423]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.423 --> 01:05:40.984]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:40.984 --> 01:05:42.565]  And you're purchasing the products
[01:05:45.666 --> 01:05:51.067]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.067 --> 01:06:07.971]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:07.971 --> 01:06:14.273]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.052 --> 01:06:24.933]  50,000 unstoppable watts!
[01:06:24.933 --> 01:06:28.154]  And tracks!
[01:06:28.154 --> 01:06:29.334]  And radio!
[01:06:29.334 --> 01:06:44.157]  Better look out.
[01:06:51.116 --> 01:07:10.414]  I gotta load some more clutch on my... on my playlist.
[01:07:10.414 --> 01:07:13.117]  Anthrax and radio.
[01:07:13.117 --> 01:07:14.038]  You better look out!
[01:07:19.462 --> 01:07:20.162]  We're back live.
[01:07:20.162 --> 01:07:37.453]  If you just joined us, I was getting into the group that has committed 100% of the mass school shootings since 1999 when the phenomenon began.
[01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:42.716]  Now don't you think that ought to be some information that people should know?
[01:07:42.716 --> 01:07:44.377]  But I guarantee you,
[01:07:45.285 --> 01:07:53.951]  When we post this video of this live show, this segment, to Facebook, and to Twitter, and to YouTube, they're gonna block it particularly.
[01:07:53.951 --> 01:08:12.764]  And so I want the people that do that censorship to understand, when you block this information, you become an accomplice to the next school shooting when another one of these incels shoves that gun right to that girl's head while they beg for their lives, and they commit that satanic sacrifice.
[01:08:13.763 --> 01:08:15.463]  Because that's what they do.
[01:08:15.463 --> 01:08:17.924]  They like a bacon.
[01:08:17.924 --> 01:08:19.864]  And they feed on it.
[01:08:19.864 --> 01:08:24.985]  And they splatter their brains and their guts and their blood all over the walls.
[01:08:24.985 --> 01:08:29.886]  And then they're too cowardly to even shove the gun in their own mouth most of the time.
[01:08:29.886 --> 01:08:35.568]  Because they want to watch themselves on the news and read about it and try to creep people out of the jail.
[01:08:35.568 --> 01:08:37.888]  And pretty boy around.
[01:08:37.888 --> 01:08:41.909]  So, the profile is a metrosexual
[01:08:43.112 --> 01:08:45.253]  Narcissist, devil worshipper.
[01:08:45.253 --> 01:08:48.635]  That's why they have Nazi, communist, satanic pentagrams.
[01:08:48.635 --> 01:08:52.377]  They always get trench coats and all this stuff to try to look powerful, look evil.
[01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:53.538]  And they fantasize about it.
[01:08:53.538 --> 01:08:56.640]  And they play the shoot-em-up video games and they do it all.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.081]  And then they get rejected.
[01:08:59.081 --> 01:09:00.482]  And then they think about killing people.
[01:09:00.482 --> 01:09:02.083]  And they go, no, I'll go play football.
[01:09:02.083 --> 01:09:03.684]  Or I'll try as hard as I can to be cool.
[01:09:03.684 --> 01:09:05.465]  But they can't handle the rejection.
[01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:10.640]  And so they want to go out in a big blaze of glory.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:17.723]  Every mass shooting, because they add in to the 46, 56, the number, it's, I kept saying 56, it's 46.
[01:09:19.972 --> 01:09:24.473]  On average, since 1999, there are 46 people killed in mass shootings.
[01:09:24.473 --> 01:09:28.074]  Now, about half of those are really the big mass shooting where a bunch of people get killed.
[01:09:28.074 --> 01:09:36.917]  The others are gang-related, where it's not good, it's terrible, but somebody didn't pay somebody, or somebody beat somebody up, somebody's scared of them because they're bigger, so they shoot them.
[01:09:36.917 --> 01:09:38.898]  And it's usually one or two people get shot.
[01:09:38.898 --> 01:09:40.478]  It's gang-related.
[01:09:40.478 --> 01:09:43.999]  And you got white gangs doing it, black gangs doing it, Hispanic gangs doing it.
[01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:45.220]  That's a totally different thing.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.520]  And that happened in schools before.
[01:09:48.487 --> 01:09:49.127]  1999.
[01:09:49.127 --> 01:09:58.669]  But up to 1999, none of that mass shooting, trench coat mafia thing ever happened.
[01:09:58.669 --> 01:10:04.830]  I mean, you take the students at Columbine.
[01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:08.291]  Turned out both of them were part Jewish.
[01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.151]  But they were into Hitler.
[01:10:10.151 --> 01:10:12.871]  And they wore swastikas inside their black trench coats.
[01:10:12.871 --> 01:10:13.911]  Why would you do that?
[01:10:13.911 --> 01:10:16.592]  Well, because there's a fetishizing evil.
[01:10:17.987 --> 01:10:20.908]  If Hitler killed Jews, well, you're Jewish.
[01:10:20.908 --> 01:10:23.810]  It's about killing yourself.
[01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:24.530]  You see?
[01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:25.310]  It's about death.
[01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:26.131]  It's about suicide.
[01:10:26.131 --> 01:10:27.411]  It's about being rebellious.
[01:10:27.411 --> 01:10:32.874]  It's about being bad.
[01:10:32.874 --> 01:10:33.354]  Now there it is.
[01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:34.915]  Columbine Shooter had Jewish roots.
[01:10:34.915 --> 01:10:35.895]  Dreaded Passover.
[01:10:39.076 --> 01:10:41.136]  And then we looked into the other guy, he has it too.
[01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:50.878]  The point is, is that it's not the Jewish issue, it's the issue that they were into Nazism, just like this guy down on the Texas coast.
[01:10:50.878 --> 01:10:51.739]  And he gave it a run.
[01:10:51.739 --> 01:10:56.099]  He tried to be popular, tried to be cool, and he got rejected.
[01:10:56.099 --> 01:11:04.001]  Dude, go pick up a waitress who's getting divorced from her husband down at the diner.
[01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:05.661]  You don't pick chicks up at the high school, bro.
[01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.842]  But you're not a player.
[01:11:07.842 --> 01:11:08.322]  You don't know that.
[01:11:11.192 --> 01:11:18.855]  See, all the real men in school, Sonny, they got girlfriends in college.
[01:11:18.855 --> 01:11:20.515]  I need to give men lessons on things.
[01:11:20.515 --> 01:11:21.956]  I mean, I really do.
[01:11:21.956 --> 01:11:25.997]  Because you become a man because 50 women reject you.
[01:11:27.093 --> 01:11:31.634]  You ever wonder why cool black guys have so many great girlfriends and are doing so well out there?
[01:11:31.634 --> 01:11:33.535]  Because they'll go by on average.
[01:11:33.535 --> 01:11:34.415]  I grew up in Dallas, man.
[01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:35.076]  I have a lot of black friends.
[01:11:35.076 --> 01:11:36.056]  I got to pick up for them.
[01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:36.716]  Hey, you want to go out?
[01:11:36.716 --> 01:11:37.276]  Want to have some fun?
[01:11:37.276 --> 01:11:38.137]  Want to go do some stuff?
[01:11:38.137 --> 01:11:38.797]  She doesn't want me.
[01:11:38.797 --> 01:11:39.377]  She doesn't want me.
[01:11:39.377 --> 01:11:40.057]  She doesn't want me.
[01:11:40.057 --> 01:11:40.337]  Boom!
[01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:40.917]  Bingo!
[01:11:40.917 --> 01:11:42.878]  She wants me.
[01:11:42.878 --> 01:11:44.278]  Get in the car, sweetheart.
[01:11:44.278 --> 01:11:52.681]  Let's go down by the river.
[01:11:52.681 --> 01:11:53.481]  And that's what it is.
[01:11:53.481 --> 01:11:54.602]  These guys are arrested.
[01:11:55.546 --> 01:11:58.808]  They want women and they don't even know how to get them.
[01:11:58.808 --> 01:12:02.070]  Those aren't women you're going after at the high school.
[01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.990]  Most of them.
[01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:08.974]  They don't want to hang out with a creepy weirdo guy.
[01:12:08.974 --> 01:12:12.175]  So you're gonna kill a bunch of people because they didn't want to be with you?
[01:12:12.175 --> 01:12:13.876]  Exactly.
[01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:16.918]  Why don't you learn how to tell a joke?
[01:12:16.918 --> 01:12:21.661]  Why don't you learn how to have some fun?
[01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:23.802]  Why don't you really be the bad boy in the school?
[01:12:26.155 --> 01:12:29.816]  And that just means standing up to bullies and stuff.
[01:12:29.816 --> 01:12:35.437]  Instead, you're going to go kill a bunch of people.
[01:12:35.437 --> 01:12:37.558]  They're devil worshippers.
[01:12:37.558 --> 01:12:41.379]  And in the last segment of this hour, I'm going to play Paul's excellent breakdown on this.
[01:12:41.379 --> 01:12:44.580]  But they all identify with Satanism.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.320]  They always identify with the occult.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.961]  But you have to understand, it's a spirit.
[01:12:50.859 --> 01:12:51.980]  Incel.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.100]  Involuntary settlement.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:13:03.766]  And that doesn't mean that guys that have problems with women have been hurt by women, women can be mean, and that, you know, who lead bachelor lifestyles, that they're bad people.
[01:13:03.766 --> 01:13:14.072]  This is a particular group of folks, programmed by society, and the final ingredient is the media giving the incels attention.
[01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:23.718]  And turning them into a god like Charlie Manson.
[01:13:23.718 --> 01:13:27.621]  And letting you hear their philosophy and putting them up on a perch.
[01:13:27.621 --> 01:13:30.203]  Hollywood did that on purpose with Charlie Manson.
[01:13:30.203 --> 01:13:33.166]  And that whole MKUltra experiment.
[01:13:33.166 --> 01:13:40.871]  Did you know it's admitted that Manson was working for the CIA and distributing LSD?
[01:13:40.871 --> 01:13:44.995]  Every major city had a couple of these guys to be the gurus on the universities.
[01:13:46.095 --> 01:13:47.737]  And to deliver the drugs and all the rest of it.
[01:13:47.737 --> 01:13:51.642]  But then he kind of went off the reservation sideways.
[01:13:51.642 --> 01:13:53.884]  And you know, Sharon Tate did a little too much.
[01:13:53.884 --> 01:13:56.888]  Sharon Tate didn't like some of the stuff she was learning about.
[01:13:56.888 --> 01:14:01.674]  Some of the things that were going on when she was in France shooting those movies.
[01:14:04.172 --> 01:14:22.231]  about devil worship and well Sharon Tate got that baby cut out of her so Satanism is not a fun thing to play around with boys and girls so I would stay away from that if I was you so our problem is Satanism and Hollywood is Satanism
[01:14:23.194 --> 01:14:24.095]  It steals your time.
[01:14:24.095 --> 01:14:27.177]  It becomes your idols.
[01:14:27.177 --> 01:14:30.359]  Netflix keeps people from having sex with their wives and husbands.
[01:14:30.359 --> 01:14:34.362]  Netflix, they have studies out, is what's lowering the growth of the U.S.
[01:14:34.362 --> 01:14:37.504]  indigenous population.
[01:14:37.504 --> 01:14:39.866]  Does that sound like something we want to be part of?
[01:14:39.866 --> 01:14:40.366]  No.
[01:14:40.366 --> 01:14:42.968]  Everything they deploy against us is death.
[01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:46.950]  Everything that gives us life, they're trying to block it.
[01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:49.854]  Just like they're trying to block InfoWars.
[01:14:49.854 --> 01:14:52.637]  Because InfoWars is a fan of life.
[01:14:52.637 --> 01:14:54.199]  Trump is a fan of life.
[01:14:54.199 --> 01:14:59.206]  Trump is a fan of progress and success and beauty and women.
[01:14:59.846 --> 01:15:06.008]  And the system has inverted it all by controlling the church to say loving women is a sin.
[01:15:06.008 --> 01:15:11.170]  But, all the real, truly satanic activities are not even looked at.
[01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:13.151]  Oh, Morgan Freedman hit on women.
[01:15:13.151 --> 01:15:15.592]  That's his sexual harassment.
[01:15:15.592 --> 01:15:19.733]  And that's now being equated, hitting on women or asking women out.
[01:15:19.733 --> 01:15:24.075]  That is now equated to as bad as Weinstein reportedly raping hundreds of women.
[01:15:27.679 --> 01:15:35.245]  See how they do that sleight of hand?
[01:15:35.245 --> 01:15:36.826]  Think about that.
[01:15:36.826 --> 01:15:49.595]  You know, there's so much big news to break down, but I'm going to come back at the number dot, take some calls, and hit some of the other big news we haven't hit, but in America, in major schools, the name Jesus is banned from you speaking it.
[01:15:49.595 --> 01:15:51.476]  Think about that.
[01:15:51.476 --> 01:15:54.138]  They're not going to stop the Satanists from having their little club meetings.
[01:15:54.138 --> 01:15:55.860]  Oh no, they have their speech.
[01:15:57.478 --> 01:16:00.519]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:16:00.519 --> 01:16:04.501]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:05.762]  The Bug-A-Salt.

[01:17:58.291 --> 01:18:05.936]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:18:05.936 --> 01:18:13.861]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:18:13.861 --> 01:18:16.943]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:18:17.583 --> 01:18:22.227]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:18:22.227 --> 01:18:26.351]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:18:26.351 --> 01:18:29.493]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:18:29.493 --> 01:18:34.257]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:18:34.257 --> 01:18:37.300]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:52.787]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:18:52.787 --> 01:18:54.328]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:18:54.328 --> 01:18:56.729]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:18:59.641]  I'm so excited.
[01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:09.788]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:19:09.788 --> 01:19:15.313]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:19:15.313 --> 01:19:18.315]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:19:18.315 --> 01:19:27.102]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:19:29.195 --> 01:19:37.397]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:19:37.397 --> 01:19:48.779]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:19:48.779 --> 01:19:51.440]  It is amazing!
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.421]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:03.993]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:56.925]  She just ain't always around And you know that's when I fall And I can't help myself at all And I get whiskey bent and hell bound Play me some songs about a lady
[01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.342]  It's hard to turn off Hank Williams Jr.
[01:21:01.342 --> 01:21:09.347]  Remember back when Monday Night Football had 40% more ratings than it's got now?
[01:21:09.347 --> 01:21:15.811]  And everybody liked him introing it, but see, that's all gone now, and so are the ratings.
[01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:21.335]  It's fun watching Hollywood and all its appendages burn up in flames, isn't it?
[01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:25.758]  Makes me as happy as a possum that sneaks into your kitchen at night and eats all the pumpkin pie.
[01:21:29.286 --> 01:21:33.454]  One time I was at deer camp, got a little cook shack.
[01:21:33.454 --> 01:21:34.576]  I got up at 4 a.m.
[01:21:34.576 --> 01:21:39.846]  because it was my day to go cook biscuits and gravy and eggs.
[01:21:39.846 --> 01:21:40.568]  I walk in there.
[01:21:42.466 --> 01:21:44.627]  It's Jack Daniels sitting there on the counter from the night before.
[01:21:44.627 --> 01:21:48.728]  I better have a little bit of that to wake up and get the coffee going.
[01:21:48.728 --> 01:21:54.909]  Here's something I look over, and there in the corner is the half-eaten pumpkin pie with a possum still eating it!
[01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:58.490]  He was just hoping, I didn't notice him, he was just in the, looking up.
[01:21:58.490 --> 01:22:01.551]  I said, I'm just going to let you keep eating that.
[01:22:01.551 --> 01:22:07.573]  Everybody starts waking up, coming in there, and we all finish breakfast while the possum was sitting there eating over in the corner, up on the counter.
[01:22:09.226 --> 01:22:12.607]  We left, went out and deer hunted that day, shot a couple deer.
[01:22:12.607 --> 01:22:15.107]  Came back about 1pm and he was gone.
[01:22:15.107 --> 01:22:18.428]  And the pumpkin pie was all lit clean.
[01:22:18.428 --> 01:22:21.509]  There was little paw prints too.
[01:22:21.509 --> 01:22:23.629]  That's a true story.
[01:22:23.629 --> 01:22:24.289]  Ugly creatures.
[01:22:24.289 --> 01:22:26.610]  Kind of cute though.
[01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:28.490]  My parents had this big oak tree by their house.
[01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:32.811]  It fell down in a big storm, but there was generations of possums raised in it.
[01:22:33.826 --> 01:22:39.068]  And the little possums would come out and my dad would feed them and he could pick them up.
[01:22:39.068 --> 01:22:40.549]  Baby possums.
[01:22:40.549 --> 01:22:40.989]  Pretty cute.
[01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:44.890]  I was like, you know, I used to shoot possums just for fun.
[01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:48.692]  And now I feel bad about that.
[01:22:48.692 --> 01:22:50.493]  After my dad had the little baby possums.
[01:22:50.493 --> 01:22:52.073]  It took a couple generations too.
[01:22:52.073 --> 01:22:54.414]  Then some owls moved in.
[01:22:54.414 --> 01:22:58.216]  And the craziest thing my mom ever saw was a baby owl fell out of the tree.
[01:22:59.195 --> 01:23:05.138]  It was a horned owl, and the horned owl flew down like a helicopter, grabbed the baby, and took it back up.
[01:23:05.138 --> 01:23:12.102]  She told me about that, and I search-engined it, and I can't find a spot where you see an owl picking up its baby, but my mom saw it.
[01:23:12.102 --> 01:23:19.245]  Kind of like that video, I forgot to give it to you guys, of the bald eagle.
[01:23:19.245 --> 01:23:22.287]  There's a fox, and it's killed a rabbit.
[01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:24.837]  And the bald eagle tries to steal it.
[01:23:24.837 --> 01:23:33.983]  The fox turns around, bites the bald eagle's claw, hangs on to it, goes up 20 feet in the air, and the bald eagle finally drops it, along with the rabbit.
[01:23:33.983 --> 01:23:36.565]  That is the image of tenacity right there.
[01:23:36.565 --> 01:23:37.646]  I just saw that video yesterday.
[01:23:37.646 --> 01:23:38.486]  I meant to send that to you guys.
[01:23:38.486 --> 01:23:39.387]  I forgot.
[01:23:39.387 --> 01:23:42.949]  I tweeted a still shot of the HD video, the real Alex Jones.
[01:23:42.949 --> 01:23:44.110]  You know, let's just see.
[01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:46.792]  I start listening to Hank Williams Jr., George Strait.
[01:23:46.792 --> 01:23:49.234]  I need to just take a vacation and load up the truck.
[01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:55.052]  With my son, and go hunting.
[01:23:55.052 --> 01:23:57.795]  Only thing in season right now is wild hogs, but they need killing.
[01:23:57.795 --> 01:23:59.536]  There's too many of them.
[01:23:59.536 --> 01:24:00.217]  That's it.
[01:24:00.217 --> 01:24:06.642]  I've been invited out to this local doctor's place, and out in Marble Falls, and I'm going to make that phone call, because I've canceled three times.
[01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:08.824]  I'm going to go hunting.
[01:24:08.824 --> 01:24:11.126]  You know, part of life is having a little bit of fun.
[01:24:11.126 --> 01:24:11.787]  Yeah, here's the footage.
[01:24:13.075 --> 01:24:15.196]  Zachary J.E.
[01:24:15.196 --> 01:24:16.316]  Photography.
[01:24:16.316 --> 01:24:17.636]  Amazing.
[01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:18.176]  Boom!
[01:24:18.176 --> 01:24:20.597]  I guess the, uh, what's the headline of the video?
[01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:23.478]  So I can plug it, people will go find it themselves, they're a radio listener.
[01:24:23.478 --> 01:24:28.279]  That's real footage, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:28.279 --> 01:24:31.020]  That's an amazing photographer, I gotta tell you.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.621]  Boom!
[01:24:33.621 --> 01:24:34.241]  Not fun.
[01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:36.061]  And that is real footage.
[01:24:36.061 --> 01:24:37.102]  That's real world.
[01:24:37.102 --> 01:24:41.443]  When I tweeted it, I said, truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:42.103]  It's a red fox.
[01:24:43.769 --> 01:24:46.351]  It looks like a juvenile fox, too.
[01:24:46.351 --> 01:24:47.191]  Juvenile red fox.
[01:24:47.191 --> 01:24:52.135]  I know there's some smaller species of red fox.
[01:24:52.135 --> 01:24:52.775]  Look at that.
[01:24:52.775 --> 01:24:53.356]  Raw video.
[01:24:53.356 --> 01:24:55.917]  Bald eagle snatches a fox holding a rabbit.
[01:24:55.917 --> 01:24:57.859]  Fox News.
[01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.080]  Amazing.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.941]  You know, let's just have a fun time today.
[01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:01.702]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:01.702 --> 01:25:07.986]  That doesn't matter that they, you know, the globalists are pedophiles kidnapping little kids and torturing them to death.
[01:25:07.986 --> 01:25:10.027]  I really should not be such a negative person.
[01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:12.189]  I should really leave the globalists alone, shouldn't I?
[01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:14.771]  It'd be a lot easier if I did that.
[01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:29.521]  You know, I said I'd take some calls, and I've kind of burned time and haven't done it, and I also said I'm going to air Paul's powerful report on we've identified 100% of the people taking people's lives in mass shootings.
[01:25:29.521 --> 01:25:40.990]  And they are what they call incels, spoiled rotten brats who are always into the occult, always into Nazism, always into communism, whatever's bad, whatever's wicked, who throw big fits.
[01:25:41.914 --> 01:25:43.596]  And you'd think that that's big news.
[01:25:43.596 --> 01:25:46.439]  Let me tell you something.
[01:25:46.439 --> 01:25:51.845]  You got one of these guys in your school who threatens to be a school shooter so he gets attention and scare people.
[01:25:53.237 --> 01:25:54.938]  That's geeking out.
[01:25:54.938 --> 01:25:56.119]  People think like a geek's a nerd.
[01:25:56.119 --> 01:26:04.503]  No, the real term for a geek at a carnival show is somebody that bites the heads off chickens and bats and rats and things.
[01:26:04.503 --> 01:26:13.788]  So these people want to get attention and want to kind of shock everybody and they kind of fill that role and then people kind of join in and bully on it.
[01:26:13.788 --> 01:26:15.109]  Now, if you got one of these people,
[01:26:16.308 --> 01:26:19.149]  You need to get your children out of that school.
[01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:22.410]  And they need to be run out.
[01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:30.033]  Or some young lady needs to somehow find the humanity in this person and try to reprieve them.
[01:26:30.033 --> 01:26:32.214]  But I wouldn't put myself in that danger.
[01:26:32.214 --> 01:26:37.236]  I mean, yeah, what they need is to have a fist fight with their dad in the backyard.
[01:26:37.236 --> 01:26:39.257]  But ooh, you can't do that nowadays.
[01:26:39.257 --> 01:26:41.278]  You can't have any rites of passage for these punks.
[01:26:43.797 --> 01:26:46.399]  Who are always there pushing their mom around.
[01:26:46.399 --> 01:26:49.601]  There's almost never daddy at home.
[01:26:49.601 --> 01:26:51.562]  That's another part of it.
[01:26:51.562 --> 01:26:56.125]  These young punks need to have their asses handed to them.
[01:26:56.125 --> 01:26:59.907]  And if that means, you know, getting his nose broken, it needs to happen.
[01:26:59.907 --> 01:27:01.928]  That means he needs to be kicked upside the head.
[01:27:01.928 --> 01:27:02.669]  That's how this works.
[01:27:04.068 --> 01:27:12.295]  And if you don't do that with punks like this that get in people's faces because they're always beating up their mom or they got some dad they push around, they need their asses handed to them.
[01:27:12.295 --> 01:27:16.798]  I mean, I'm sorry, that's what they need.
[01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:21.162]  They need to get hurt bad.
[01:27:21.162 --> 01:27:22.043]  Then they'll turn into men.
[01:27:22.995 --> 01:27:28.437]  But they're always these candy-ass metrosexuals that are in love with themselves.
[01:27:28.437 --> 01:27:36.460]  And they're gonna show these women that didn't see how beautiful they were, they're gonna show them by shoving a gun in their head and splattering their brains all over the wall.
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:39.281]  These are dangerous Satanists and I want them stopped!
[01:27:40.544 --> 01:27:47.066]  Because the left has created this, and they've nurtured it, and they hype it up, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:27:47.066 --> 01:27:49.327]  And these guys are clear and present danger.
[01:27:49.327 --> 01:28:01.910]  But you're not going to hear Jack Squat out of the fake feminist at the CIA and Gloria Steinem because they've created these little monsters by putting a prohibition on manhood and rights of passage!
[01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:02.530]  We're going to break.
[01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:03.711]  We'll take your calls when we get back.
[01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:03.771]  877-789-2539.
[01:28:03.771 --> 01:28:03.811]  877-789-2539.
[01:28:09.821 --> 01:28:11.102]  Do you think the worm's turned?
[01:28:11.102 --> 01:28:16.307]  I can feel the energy, at least in this chapter, that things are bad, but we are turning the tide right now.
[01:28:16.307 --> 01:28:20.851]  So much happening, so much going on.
[01:28:20.851 --> 01:28:25.174]  I want to get this young man on in Illinois where they've banned him saying the word Jesus in his speech.
[01:28:25.174 --> 01:28:27.016]  Totally unconstitutional.
[01:28:27.016 --> 01:28:30.699]  They invert everything.
[01:28:30.699 --> 01:28:33.482]  The First Amendment says you can't control what he says.
[01:28:35.265 --> 01:28:37.266]  But that's what their war against me is all about, too.
[01:28:37.266 --> 01:28:42.268]  The idea that you can't question chemical gas attacks or mass shootings or anything.
[01:28:42.268 --> 01:28:45.890]  And they misrepresent what I've said and then set that precedent to overturn it.
[01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:53.413]  But it's only a testament to our effectiveness and your effectiveness spreading the word about InfoWars.com.
[01:28:53.413 --> 01:28:55.994]  They can't stop you when you decide to act.
[01:28:57.495 --> 01:29:00.517]  Want revenge on the common housefly?

[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.761]  The Bug-A-Salt.

[01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:13.421]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:16.805]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:32:17.305 --> 01:32:17.665]  Thank you.
[01:32:17.665 --> 01:32:17.965]  Absolutely.
[01:32:39.991 --> 01:33:00.864]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:33:00.864 --> 01:33:08.849]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:08.889]  Ow!
[01:33:11.104 --> 01:33:14.065]  They think you're a goldfish!
[01:33:14.065 --> 01:33:16.425]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[01:33:16.425 --> 01:33:17.365]  I believe in you!
[01:33:17.365 --> 01:33:19.125]  I don't think you're stupid!
[01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:25.907]  One man, emirates a woman, old genitals are cut off!
[01:33:25.907 --> 01:33:28.447]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[01:33:28.447 --> 01:33:31.608]  And we're not backing down on her!
[01:33:31.608 --> 01:33:32.788]  I wanna kick these people!
[01:33:32.788 --> 01:33:33.348]  We're winning!
[01:33:33.348 --> 01:33:34.588]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[01:33:34.588 --> 01:33:35.348]  Can't you?
[01:33:35.348 --> 01:33:37.349]  We have broken their back!
[01:33:37.349 --> 01:33:38.469]  Yes, I can feel it!
[01:33:42.327 --> 01:33:42.727]  Let's go!
[01:33:42.727 --> 01:33:43.007]  Come on!
[01:33:43.007 --> 01:33:43.388]  Come on!

[01:33:56.334 --> 01:33:56.634]  Come on!
[01:33:56.634 --> 01:33:57.215]  Come on!
[01:33:57.215 --> 01:33:57.755]  Come on!

[01:33:57.975 --> 01:33:58.375]  Come on!
[01:33:58.375 --> 01:33:58.595]  Come on!
[01:33:58.595 --> 01:33:58.796]  Come on!
[01:33:58.796 --> 01:33:58.996]  Come on!
[01:33:58.996 --> 01:33:59.376]  Come on!
[01:33:59.376 --> 01:33:59.636]  Come on!
[01:33:59.636 --> 01:33:59.856]  Come on!
[01:33:59.856 --> 01:34:00.036]  Come on!
[01:34:00.036 --> 01:34:00.296]  Come on!
[01:34:00.296 --> 01:34:00.596]  Come on!
[01:34:00.596 --> 01:34:00.857]  Come on!
[01:34:00.857 --> 01:34:01.117]  Come on!
[01:34:01.117 --> 01:34:01.857]  Come on!
[01:34:01.857 --> 01:34:02.637]  Come on!
[01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:02.898]  Come on!
[01:34:02.898 --> 01:34:03.178]  Come on!
[01:34:03.178 --> 01:34:03.498]  Come on!
[01:34:03.498 --> 01:34:03.698]  Come on!
[01:34:03.698 --> 01:34:03.918]  Come on!
[01:34:03.918 --> 01:34:04.298]  Come on!
[01:34:04.298 --> 01:34:04.799]  Come on!
[01:34:04.799 --> 01:34:04.999]  Come on!
[01:34:04.999 --> 01:34:05.219]  Come on!
[01:34:05.219 --> 01:34:05.439]  Come on!
[01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:05.819]  Come on!
[01:34:05.819 --> 01:34:06.179]  Come on!
[01:34:06.179 --> 01:34:06.519]  Come on!
[01:34:06.519 --> 01:34:06.820]  Come on!
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:07.040]  Come on!
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:07.320]  Come on!
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:07.440]  Come
[01:34:12.383 --> 01:34:15.884]  How they intimidate us, how they bully us, how they censor us.
[01:34:15.884 --> 01:34:23.645]  I was just reading about this the other day and I was talking to one of our tech guys who's doing a report on it.
[01:34:23.645 --> 01:34:25.665]  Harrison Smith.
[01:34:25.665 --> 01:34:30.026]  YouTube is ending subscriptions.
[01:34:30.026 --> 01:34:31.046]  Yeah.
[01:34:31.046 --> 01:34:32.667]  They're ending subscriptions.
[01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.707]  They're ending your free will.
[01:34:34.707 --> 01:34:37.347]  They already don't let most people get most of the videos we send out.
[01:34:37.347 --> 01:34:38.968]  They already shadow ban, they already block.
[01:34:38.968 --> 01:34:40.428]  But now they're announcing for everyone
[01:34:41.872 --> 01:34:45.676]  They're going to decide what comes up in the subscription feed, period.
[01:34:45.676 --> 01:34:52.902]  Their algorithm will decide if you can even see on the page you visit.
[01:34:52.902 --> 01:35:06.876]  So if you go to the Alex Jones channel and bypass them and use it as like a website, even though they're blocking 90 plus percent of people from getting our notifications now,
[01:35:10.643 --> 01:35:14.625]  They're just going to end subscriptions, but they'll act like it's there.
[01:35:14.625 --> 01:35:23.850]  Oh, you still get your magazine in the mail, but if the government censor decides that that issue's not good, they'll put a notice up and they'll just take that magazine away.
[01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:24.850]  That's what this is.
[01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:33.515]  Imagine if the post office said, well, we let everybody get Time Magazine unless we decide a particular issue isn't good, and then we're going to go ahead and just take that.
[01:35:33.515 --> 01:35:34.836]  You'd be like, this is incredible.
[01:35:34.836 --> 01:35:36.597]  My God, this is America.
[01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.678]  But they're like, oh,
[01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:45.811]  Our algorithm will decide what subscriptions you actually get.
[01:35:45.811 --> 01:35:46.571]  Maybe none.
[01:35:46.571 --> 01:35:47.912]  Maybe all of them.
[01:35:47.912 --> 01:35:50.374]  Because they already force-feed all the garbage.
[01:35:50.374 --> 01:35:57.278]  If they want a particular video creating race war in America to get 300 million views, it will.
[01:35:57.278 --> 01:35:59.379]  They're gonna force-feed it to you.
[01:35:59.379 --> 01:36:00.800]  People go, we'll just leave YouTube.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.702]  It's everywhere.
[01:36:03.702 --> 01:36:05.183]  They're coming after InfoWars.
[01:36:05.183 --> 01:36:06.343]  They're coming after me.
[01:36:06.343 --> 01:36:08.745]  They're having congressional hearings about how they want to shut Drudge Report down.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:16.421]  They're putting people in jail for six months to a year for making Hitler jokes that John Cleese made.
[01:36:16.421 --> 01:36:17.161]  In England.
[01:36:17.161 --> 01:36:17.501]  It's here.
[01:36:17.501 --> 01:36:21.742]  I know I keep going over this, but men and women better get aggressive.
[01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:25.062]  You better go to your church and say, I want to speak in front of the church about censorship.
[01:36:25.062 --> 01:36:26.183]  Now that church doesn't let you?
[01:36:26.183 --> 01:36:27.263]  You need to leave it because it's not a church.
[01:36:27.263 --> 01:36:29.063]  You need to be at city council.
[01:36:29.063 --> 01:36:34.764]  You need to be everywhere getting upset folks or they will take everything from you.
[01:36:34.764 --> 01:36:36.664]  We're striking back.
[01:36:36.664 --> 01:36:38.285]  We're fighting hard.
[01:36:38.285 --> 01:36:39.925]  We're committed because we know these are bad people.
[01:36:41.075 --> 01:36:48.316]  It's a normal instinct if somebody's laying on top of you, suffocating you.
[01:36:48.316 --> 01:37:03.199]  I mean, I remember the experience when I was like 10 years old, before I started, you know, went into puberty when I was 11, started fighting, that back in the old days, my parents were what you call just mainline Americans, but I would come home with black eyes and stuff.
[01:37:03.199 --> 01:37:04.519]  My mom would say, oh, honey, I'm sorry.
[01:37:04.519 --> 01:37:07.200]  My dad would be like, well, you know, how old are they?
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:07.440]  They're 14, 15?
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.040]  A couple of them beat you up?
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.763]  You were out walking home from the school bus?
[01:37:14.763 --> 01:37:17.507]  Were there any rocks around?
[01:37:17.507 --> 01:37:24.595]  Because, you know, if a bunch of guys are four or five years old and you go ahead and smash them upside the head with a rock.
[01:37:24.595 --> 01:37:27.258]  And, you know, a few times it was a really older kid doing something.
[01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:29.521]  My dad would go threaten to kick their dad's ass or whatever.
[01:37:29.521 --> 01:37:32.084]  But the whole point is
[01:37:35.839 --> 01:37:36.699]  I remember that a few times.
[01:37:36.699 --> 01:37:41.522]  My dad wasn't a troublemaker, but, you know, I'd be like 6 years old and some 12-year-old, 14-year-old beat me up.
[01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:43.563]  I remember my dad taking me to the person's door, knocking.
[01:37:43.563 --> 01:37:44.703]  Some guy with tattoos.
[01:37:44.703 --> 01:37:46.304]  Watched my dad's side walk out.
[01:37:46.304 --> 01:37:49.305]  My dad said, get your ass in the yard, I'm gonna beat the living hell out of you right now.
[01:37:49.305 --> 01:37:50.686]  Come on, you son of a bitch!
[01:37:50.686 --> 01:37:52.127]  And they wouldn't, of course, walk off that thing.
[01:37:52.127 --> 01:37:57.269]  My dad, my mom told the story once.
[01:38:00.831 --> 01:38:06.835]  We're like five UT football players started a fight with my dad at the park because he had long hair and he beat the living hell out of all of them.
[01:38:06.835 --> 01:38:08.136]  Now back then he was a gymnast too.
[01:38:08.136 --> 01:38:11.258]  He could do the whole gymnast thing where we can all stick out straight and everything.
[01:38:11.258 --> 01:38:14.580]  Now he like hobbles around like an old wizard.
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:18.623]  But the point is, is that I don't know why I'm even going into these stories.
[01:38:18.623 --> 01:38:22.005]  I just cannot believe that people put up with this crap.
[01:38:22.005 --> 01:38:22.966]  I'm done with it.
[01:38:22.966 --> 01:38:23.626]  I'm tired of it.
[01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:38.855]  And they are attacking men in this country, and they are trying to make everybody submit to this garbage.
[01:38:38.855 --> 01:38:48.999]  And we don't even stand up for our children, and we turn them into these wimps and these nanny-states, but they're going to end up getting mugged or attacked sometime in their life, and they're not going to know what to do.
[01:38:48.999 --> 01:38:50.900]  And so they get even more scared, and then they want
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.945]  The government to get bigger and have more power and then all it does is turn that into another corruption.
[01:38:58.945 --> 01:39:00.727]  And today I'm just all over the map.
[01:39:00.727 --> 01:39:01.948]  There's so much to get into.
[01:39:01.948 --> 01:39:05.971]  I'm telling stories about my dad, stories about possums eating pumpkin pie.
[01:39:05.971 --> 01:39:09.715]  Who knows where I'll go next, but...
[01:39:13.976 --> 01:39:19.581]  If we don't stand up to these globalists, they're going to psychically, financially, culturally rape us.
[01:39:19.581 --> 01:39:22.623]  And I don't care what happens to me as long as we get them off of us.
[01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.905]  Oh, that was where I went with the fighting.
[01:39:24.905 --> 01:39:29.329]  I remember being about like 11 years old.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:45.905]  When I finally, like, when the berserker came out, there was like four or five guys, this big fat guy was sitting on me, spitting in my face, and they were all holding my arms and legs down, and it's that experience of being beaten up, slowly,
[01:39:46.545 --> 01:39:52.771]  And finally just going into a total rage and throwing them off at me and grabbing a rock, like my dad said, and smashing it across one of their faces.
[01:39:52.771 --> 01:39:55.153]  And then their parents tried to sue, but they were all witnesses.
[01:39:55.153 --> 01:39:55.853]  It doesn't happen.
[01:39:55.853 --> 01:39:59.276]  Hey, I'm sorry you lost your eye, you fat piece of garbage!
[01:39:59.276 --> 01:40:01.198]  That's what war is like!
[01:40:01.198 --> 01:40:03.861]  You start the fight, you pay!
[01:40:03.861 --> 01:40:08.465]  And that's what Soros and all these creepy... Imagine when he was a kid, he was rounding up Jews!
[01:40:09.923 --> 01:40:11.223]  Think about who we're facing.
[01:40:11.223 --> 01:40:14.745]  These are the worst people on Earth.
[01:40:14.745 --> 01:40:16.746]  And we're going to deal with them.
[01:40:16.746 --> 01:40:19.226]  We're going to annihilate them.
[01:40:19.226 --> 01:40:20.287]  We're going to win.
[01:40:20.287 --> 01:40:25.149]  You know, I said I'd go to Paul's report, and it's too late to go to it.
[01:40:25.149 --> 01:40:27.890]  It's called... What's the name of it?
[01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:28.230]  I forget.
[01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:28.950]  It's really powerful.
[01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:34.852]  It's about the incel... Say it again?
[01:40:34.852 --> 01:40:36.873]  Truth about incels.
[01:40:36.873 --> 01:40:39.214]  Truth about incels.
[01:40:39.214 --> 01:40:39.334]  And...
[01:40:46.653 --> 01:40:48.195]  So I'm going to skip that.
[01:40:48.195 --> 01:40:50.599]  I said I'd play it, but take my intros to it earlier.
[01:40:50.599 --> 01:40:54.906]  We'll put it on YouTube and Facebook while we still have that for the next few months before they totally shut it down.
[01:40:54.906 --> 01:40:59.693]  And put Paul's report on that when we do put that, at least on the internet we'll have it, because the two go together.
[01:40:59.693 --> 01:41:00.434]  That's why I did that earlier.
[01:41:03.058 --> 01:41:17.854]  Oh yeah, you want to fight back, buy products you really need that are great and have changed my life and many others, and support the operation, show that just from an entertainment perspective we can be as big and mean and aggressive in this collision course we're on with the deep state.
[01:41:17.854 --> 01:41:22.519]  So just fuel up my jet and I'll fly it right into them, politically.
[01:41:22.519 --> 01:41:25.122]  That's an allegory, but I'm on the tarmac.
[01:41:29.346 --> 01:41:29.546]  We're good.

[01:42:43.287 --> 01:42:52.854]  We'll be back on the other side of the Infowar as we engage the enemy at point-blank range and accelerate towards absolute planetary victory and
[01:42:53.354 --> 01:42:57.336]  Interstellar expansion!
[01:42:57.336 --> 01:43:04.961]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:43:04.961 --> 01:43:12.886]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:15.968]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:43:16.608 --> 01:43:21.253]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:43:21.253 --> 01:43:25.396]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:43:25.396 --> 01:43:28.539]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:43:28.539 --> 01:43:33.304]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:43:33.304 --> 01:43:36.307]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:43:36.747 --> 01:43:51.845]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:43:51.845 --> 01:43:53.367]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:43:53.367 --> 01:43:55.469]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.

[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.020]  Read the facts.
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:42.021]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:09.997 --> 01:47:14.461]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:15.982]  Oh, I'm gonna really start telling.
[01:47:15.982 --> 01:47:19.586]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[01:47:19.586 --> 01:47:20.747]  He was dressed like 1950!
[01:47:20.747 --> 01:47:23.529]  He was dressed like 1950!
[01:47:23.529 --> 01:47:25.511]  Half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[01:47:28.852 --> 01:47:31.035]  Would you like to ride, son?
[01:47:31.035 --> 01:47:33.678]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:33.678 --> 01:47:38.846]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:47:43.459 --> 01:47:49.282]  And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid country gold.
[01:47:49.282 --> 01:47:54.806]  Then I noticed a stranger was ghost white there when he asked me for a light.
[01:47:54.806 --> 01:47:59.268]  And I knew there was something strange about this ride.
[01:47:59.268 --> 01:48:04.071]  He said, he said, Drifter, can you make folks cry when you play a song?
[01:48:06.503 --> 01:48:08.083]  I'm here to tell you.
[01:48:08.083 --> 01:48:11.644]  Long, hard ride living in a free country.
[01:48:11.644 --> 01:48:13.765]  But it's worth it, isn't it?
[01:48:13.765 --> 01:48:18.246]  Because if you don't animate yourself, you're not living, you're dying.
[01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:30.730]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:31.910]  I've been all over the map today.
[01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:34.112]  There's so much huge news.
[01:48:34.112 --> 01:48:40.355]  Rosenstein is right down there in the Capitol right now, in secret session, being warned.
[01:48:40.355 --> 01:48:40.955]  The ultimatum.
[01:48:40.955 --> 01:48:45.638]  They've already got all the intelligence.
[01:48:45.638 --> 01:48:46.738]  He's the president.
[01:48:46.738 --> 01:48:49.900]  He's got all the files.
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:53.162]  They're just telling you to hand them over to Congress so you won't do it.
[01:48:53.162 --> 01:48:56.604]  So it wets everybody's appetite, you idiots.
[01:48:56.604 --> 01:48:58.445]  But Rosenstein, you think you're smarter than everybody?
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:48:59.880]  Really?
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.141]  Cause you're a little nerd and everything?
[01:49:01.141 --> 01:49:03.884]  You got something to prove?
[01:49:03.884 --> 01:49:05.885]  Just get out of the way.
[01:49:05.885 --> 01:49:07.747]  Just get out of the way.
[01:49:07.747 --> 01:49:09.208]  Get out of the way.
[01:49:09.208 --> 01:49:10.429]  Don't you understand that?
[01:49:10.429 --> 01:49:12.931]  That is such a, that, that ludicrous song.
[01:49:12.931 --> 01:49:16.214]  It has a very Christian ethos to it.
[01:49:16.214 --> 01:49:23.280]  Uh, if you actually look at it from one perspective, because all we're saying is move, move, get out the way.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:25.702]  You see those headlights?
[01:49:25.702 --> 01:49:27.023]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[01:49:28.203 --> 01:49:29.324]  Get out the way!
[01:49:29.324 --> 01:49:30.404]  Get out the way!
[01:49:30.404 --> 01:49:32.025]  Get out the way!
[01:49:32.025 --> 01:49:33.767]  Get out the way!
[01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:36.768]  Get out the way!
[01:49:36.768 --> 01:49:37.989]  That'll be our new slogan.
[01:49:37.989 --> 01:49:39.410]  InfoWars.com.
[01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:40.671]  Get out the way.
[01:49:40.671 --> 01:49:42.672]  Get out the way.
[01:49:42.672 --> 01:49:43.693]  Get out the way.
[01:49:45.063 --> 01:49:47.924]  What does communism, what does socialism, what does all political correctness do?
[01:49:47.924 --> 01:49:49.884]  It gets in da way!
[01:49:49.884 --> 01:50:04.208]  The Renaissance is what got rid of the slavery and launched the system of true, open freedom, which has been hijacked by people claiming they're the guardians of the freedom, when they're the ones actually destroying the freedom.
[01:50:04.208 --> 01:50:07.248]  Hillary Clinton's official campaign theme song.
[01:50:07.248 --> 01:50:08.909]  Move.
[01:50:08.909 --> 01:50:09.169]  Bitch.
[01:50:11.049 --> 01:50:13.972]  It's not fair to female dogs, but that's the term.
[01:50:13.972 --> 01:50:15.754]  That's kind of a compliment they gave her.
[01:50:15.754 --> 01:50:17.076]  Move!
[01:50:17.076 --> 01:50:18.378]  Get out the way!
[01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:19.599]  Get out the way!
[01:50:19.599 --> 01:50:20.760]  Get out the way!
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:21.621]  Get out the way!
[01:50:21.621 --> 01:50:22.963]  It's that simple!
[01:50:22.963 --> 01:50:27.648]  Just get out the way!
[01:50:27.648 --> 01:50:30.972]  Trump is even offering to let Soros and all of them... Oh, what a smart...
[01:50:31.874 --> 01:50:35.835]  Ben Garrison, um, graphic he put out, I'm going to your calls yesterday.
[01:50:35.835 --> 01:50:38.575]  Can we pull up the swamp on, put it on screen for people?
[01:50:38.575 --> 01:50:39.896]  The swamp being drained?
[01:50:39.896 --> 01:50:44.416]  Because notice everybody else is in the swamp, but Soros is an owl.
[01:50:44.416 --> 01:50:45.797]  Just put it in front, thanks.
[01:50:45.797 --> 01:50:48.697]  Soros is an owl because he, he's a globalist.
[01:50:48.697 --> 01:50:51.098]  He can just jump on an airplane and leave.
[01:50:51.098 --> 01:50:56.599]  But not Hillary, not John Podesta.
[01:50:58.644 --> 01:51:10.029]  Not the dead alligator, or the New York Times, CNN, or the Washington Post, or the Bushes.
[01:51:10.029 --> 01:51:13.571]  All of it circling the drain.
[01:51:13.571 --> 01:51:15.652]  Obama.
[01:51:15.652 --> 01:51:21.334]  Obama's kind of looking up at Hillary as he prepares his dissent.
[01:51:21.334 --> 01:51:23.775]  His express elevator.
[01:51:23.775 --> 01:51:26.717]  To hell!
[01:51:26.717 --> 01:51:27.277]  Gotta love it!
[01:51:28.797 --> 01:51:39.944]  There's old Soros, the horned owl, sitting on top that tree of death.
[01:51:39.944 --> 01:51:43.706]  You know, I think Ben Garrison's an idiot savant.
[01:51:43.706 --> 01:51:44.847]  He's super smart in person.
[01:51:44.847 --> 01:51:47.349]  I'm saying, I don't think he even knows archetypally.
[01:51:47.349 --> 01:51:54.273]  I don't think people realize what a master he is.
[01:51:54.273 --> 01:51:55.534]  A true master.
[01:52:02.765 --> 01:52:05.627]  You know though, some of us have got to go down with a ship.
[01:52:05.627 --> 01:52:07.008]  Just be prepared for that.
[01:52:07.008 --> 01:52:08.329]  Don't let them turn.
[01:52:08.329 --> 01:52:10.130]  People going down with a ship as a defeat.
[01:52:10.130 --> 01:52:11.271]  It's a victory.
[01:52:11.271 --> 01:52:16.015]  If we have to go down with them, some of us, so be it.
[01:52:16.015 --> 01:52:22.519]  But you have to really metaphysically tell God, whatever it is, do it.
[01:52:22.519 --> 01:52:25.902]  Because if we go down, we don't have to take our children with us.
[01:52:25.902 --> 01:52:27.823]  They can stay up on top.
[01:52:27.823 --> 01:52:29.525]  But if you're not willing to go down, you see the
[01:52:30.407 --> 01:52:34.611]  Blood of patriots and tyrants is needed to water the tree of liberty.
[01:52:34.611 --> 01:52:41.979]  And all we have to do in this modern age is be willing to be politically assassinated, financially assassinated.
[01:52:41.979 --> 01:52:45.923]  And if you won't do that, well, you're going to have your life run over.
[01:52:45.923 --> 01:52:51.930]  Everybody's, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, to whatever the new threat is, whatever the new political correctness is, if that just goes on forever.
[01:52:52.964 --> 01:52:56.486]  Then it's always more, more, more, to now they're handing out condoms.
[01:52:56.486 --> 01:52:58.527]  I was reading the official press release this morning.
[01:52:58.527 --> 01:53:04.190]  I said, you know, let me go check and make sure the Boy Scouts really are handing out condoms like they said they are on Monday.
[01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:05.091]  And I went and read it.
[01:53:05.091 --> 01:53:08.393]  It said, got it right here somewhere.
[01:53:08.393 --> 01:53:15.337]  It said all participants will be given condoms, including the 11 year old boys and girls.
[01:53:15.337 --> 01:53:18.038]  All participants will be given condoms.
[01:53:18.038 --> 01:53:21.661]  What's the message there when you hand 11 year old boys
[01:53:22.722 --> 01:53:24.904]  Condoms.
[01:53:24.904 --> 01:53:36.553]  The message is, it's like handing somebody a gun and bullets, or handing somebody chewing gum, or handing somebody, you know, you walk in and say, hey, here's a, you know, Nintendo controller.
[01:53:36.553 --> 01:53:37.994]  Oh, you want to play Nintendo?
[01:53:37.994 --> 01:53:44.760]  Well, what they're saying is, get ready for these poor young men that are just coming around to learn how to camp and meet some friends.
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:50.164]  Get ready for, instead of the Boy Scouts of America, the Junior Swingers of America.
[01:53:51.994 --> 01:53:55.657]  He's changed the J from B, Junior.
[01:53:55.657 --> 01:54:00.541]  Swingers, America.
[01:54:00.541 --> 01:54:01.602]  Nothing's gonna go wrong.
[01:54:01.602 --> 01:54:03.564]  And then I canvassed the former Boy Scouts here.
[01:54:03.564 --> 01:54:06.406]  I was a Cub Scout, but didn't quit after that.
[01:54:06.406 --> 01:54:09.428]  So I never had, it was a church Cub Scout thing, it was great.
[01:54:09.428 --> 01:54:16.474]  It wasn't camping and stuff, but... By the time I was 11, I was already doing sports too much to be in the Boy Scouts.
[01:54:16.474 --> 01:54:18.736]  But I taught, I canvassed the Boy Scouts here.
[01:54:18.736 --> 01:54:19.657]  And they said, no, no, 20, 30 years ago,
[01:54:22.287 --> 01:54:29.557]  There was, you know, quite a bit of, uh, not with them, but, you know, quite a bit of, uh, well, I had it described to me.
[01:54:29.557 --> 01:54:36.106]  And, uh, let's just say they were giving fellatio lessons, uh, and, uh, other things.
[01:54:36.106 --> 01:54:39.091]  And, uh, you know, let's get your merit badge now for that.
[01:54:41.087 --> 01:54:43.409]  I can make some really bad jokes, but I'm not going to do it.
[01:54:43.409 --> 01:54:46.352]  I've got merit badges for a lot of things, though, I guess.
[01:54:46.352 --> 01:54:49.634]  I can think of the merit badges that they're going to be handing out.
[01:54:49.634 --> 01:54:53.298]  I mean, what are we not going to put up with at this point, folks?
[01:54:53.298 --> 01:54:56.761]  This is total cultural sabotage.
[01:54:56.761 --> 01:55:03.987]  Handing condoms to 11-year-olds is pedophilia.
[01:55:03.987 --> 01:55:07.310]  Yes, we earned our safe anal sex merit badge.
[01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:08.571]  That's basically what they're saying.
[01:55:10.353 --> 01:55:13.075]  God, I mean, and where does it go next?
[01:55:13.075 --> 01:55:17.238]  It goes into the abyss with 5G giving us all cancer.
[01:55:17.238 --> 01:55:18.598]  Let's just get off the road.
[01:55:18.598 --> 01:55:19.819]  Let's get off this plane.
[01:55:19.819 --> 01:55:21.160]  Let's get off this bus.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:22.501]  Let's go the other direction.
[01:55:22.501 --> 01:55:26.424]  It's like green fields, real rainbows, everything over here.
[01:55:26.424 --> 01:55:31.147]  See, everything fetid and collapsed.
[01:55:31.147 --> 01:55:32.688]  They advertise it's beautiful and good.
[01:55:32.688 --> 01:55:37.211]  Yeah, there goes the Boy Scouts from praying around a nice meal and learning how to be proficient.
[01:55:38.522 --> 01:55:39.903]  Fishing and hiking.
[01:55:39.903 --> 01:55:43.664]  No, now here's your condoms.
[01:55:43.664 --> 01:55:48.206]  Now, prepare yourself.
[01:55:48.206 --> 01:55:49.086]  It's what everybody's doing.
[01:55:49.086 --> 01:55:53.348]  Young and impressionable boys.
[01:55:53.348 --> 01:55:54.508]  Oh, don't ask girls out.
[01:55:54.508 --> 01:55:55.489]  That's sexual harassment.
[01:55:55.489 --> 01:55:57.649]  But here, here's your condoms for yourselves.
[01:55:57.649 --> 01:55:58.650]  See, don't touch the girls.
[01:55:58.650 --> 01:55:59.090]  They don't like you.
[01:55:59.090 --> 01:55:59.830]  You don't like them.
[01:55:59.830 --> 01:56:02.811]  Just come over here so that you don't have children.
[01:56:02.811 --> 01:56:07.013]  This is massive pedophilia preparation.
[01:56:08.442 --> 01:56:13.883]  The Boy Scouts of America is a pedophile induction center, just like the Vatican.
[01:56:13.883 --> 01:56:20.224]  And they're just mainlining it everywhere, and people that have been raped by priests, they tell them, the Pope says, it is not a sin that you are gay.
[01:56:20.224 --> 01:56:21.265]  They're like, no, I was raped.
[01:56:21.265 --> 01:56:23.245]  He's like, it is not a sin.
[01:56:23.245 --> 01:56:24.305]  Enjoy yourself.
[01:56:24.305 --> 01:56:26.326]  I love the children.
[01:56:42.087 --> 01:56:44.829]  Oh, Liberal!
[01:56:44.829 --> 01:56:47.650]  It's not a sin, my son.
[01:56:47.650 --> 01:56:53.573]  Now give me your children while the Deputy Pope is on trial for trafficking over 100 children.
[01:56:53.573 --> 01:56:55.994]  Do it, it's Liberal.
[01:56:55.994 --> 01:56:57.835]  Let us run your life.
[01:57:04.045 --> 01:57:08.448]  Scout leaders will help them, teach them how to put them on.
[01:57:08.448 --> 01:57:10.370]  It's a new merit badge, my boy.
[01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:14.533]  And then you can join the new priesthood.
[01:57:14.533 --> 01:57:17.395]  And we will teach you all far more than that.
[01:57:17.395 --> 01:57:22.438]  You will enjoy the human sacrifice of smaller children with us.
[01:57:22.438 --> 01:57:25.441]  As we resonate with hell and Satan across the eons.
[01:57:26.141 --> 01:57:27.523]  Give us your soul.
[01:57:27.523 --> 01:57:30.847]  Open your soul for destruction.
[01:57:30.847 --> 01:57:32.910]  Eternity of hell with me.
[01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:35.654]  Give yourself unto Satan.
[01:57:35.654 --> 01:57:38.337]  Desecrate the children.
[01:57:38.337 --> 01:57:41.702]  Enter the gates of hell with your sorrows, my lover.
[01:57:44.611 --> 01:57:47.353]  Soon you will be dead forever.
[01:57:47.353 --> 01:57:57.939]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.939 --> 01:57:59.760]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.862]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.862 --> 01:58:04.343]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.343 --> 01:58:11.187]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.187 --> 01:58:13.269]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.269 --> 01:58:22.975]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.975 --> 01:58:27.958]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[01:58:28.058 --> 01:58:39.764]  Patriots, stay as healthy, and as clean, and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.764 --> 01:58:43.066]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:43.066 --> 01:58:46.408]  Now it's time to change our bodies, with Z-Shield, and fullwarslife.com.
[01:58:48.191 --> 01:58:54.554]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:58:54.554 --> 01:58:57.775]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:58:57.775 --> 01:59:01.476]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:59:01.476 --> 01:59:06.178]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:06.178 --> 01:59:09.440]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:21.329]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.329 --> 01:59:29.876]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:59:31.497 --> 01:59:33.098]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:08.312]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:08.312 --> 02:00:11.234]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.234 --> 02:00:15.355]  Well, I'm suited up and on the back of the horse here going into war.
[02:00:15.355 --> 02:00:17.376]  Love it.
[02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:21.338]  And as the enemy intensifies their attacks, it just takes me up another level.
[02:00:21.338 --> 02:00:23.179]  That's how it works.
[02:00:23.179 --> 02:00:27.201]  And we are now seeing the new weapon systems at InfoWars open.
[02:00:28.562 --> 02:00:30.905]  Like opening weapons lockers.
[02:00:30.905 --> 02:00:35.031]  Now I can really begin to attack.
[02:00:35.031 --> 02:00:37.956]  It's like a video game, but it's real.
[02:00:37.956 --> 02:00:39.197]  Metaphysically.
[02:00:39.197 --> 02:00:41.521]  Now the big armories are about to open.
[02:00:41.521 --> 02:00:42.402]  The big war's here.
[02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:48.610]  The enemy has openly come out with their pushing of pedophilia and Satanism.
[02:00:48.610 --> 02:00:53.871]  Handing out condoms to 11-year-old boys so they get their merit badges and group sex.
[02:00:53.871 --> 02:00:55.852]  It's all being confirmed.
[02:00:55.852 --> 02:00:57.232]  Patrick's in Australia.
[02:00:57.232 --> 02:00:58.652]  Godfrey Bloom's coming up from the UK.
[02:00:58.652 --> 02:01:00.413]  I don't want him to host a few segments.
[02:01:00.413 --> 02:01:02.893]  I want to get him hosting some shows with us.
[02:01:02.893 --> 02:01:07.074]  And then we're going to go to Wild and Pastor Sam and Carlos and Jim and everybody.
[02:01:07.074 --> 02:01:11.655]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:01:11.655 --> 02:01:12.135]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:14.039 --> 02:01:19.503]  Hey Alex mate, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:01:19.503 --> 02:01:35.813]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and since then I've read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[02:01:36.391 --> 02:01:50.816]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield, and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[02:01:50.816 --> 02:01:51.716]  Thank you brother.
[02:01:51.716 --> 02:01:56.458]  And so, yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[02:01:57.139 --> 02:02:10.409]  It's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit, and it just, the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:02:10.409 --> 02:02:17.074]  And I wanted to say that it's an honour to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:02:19.281 --> 02:02:19.982]  God bless you.
[02:02:19.982 --> 02:02:24.226]  And look at how world government, everything is just out in the open now.
[02:02:24.226 --> 02:02:29.051]  And there's huge awakenings happening, but they're just accelerating it now.
[02:02:29.051 --> 02:02:34.055]  When people complain to the Pope about being raped by priests, he says, it's okay to be gay.
[02:02:34.055 --> 02:02:36.598]  He's saying, it's okay, we raped you.
[02:02:36.598 --> 02:02:37.379]  It's so sick.
[02:02:39.153 --> 02:02:46.640]  It's so crazy, and do you remember like 10 years ago, if you even talked about conspiracy theories, people would just laugh at you.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:48.021]  No one's laughing now.
[02:02:48.021 --> 02:02:50.043]  In fact, everyone's freaked out.
[02:02:50.043 --> 02:02:54.528]  And that's the best part, is that people are starting to take it seriously.
[02:02:54.528 --> 02:02:57.410]  And Trump, you know, he's doing it for the world.
[02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:58.892]  It's not just America.
[02:02:58.892 --> 02:03:00.934]  The world's going to follow his example.
[02:03:00.934 --> 02:03:02.115]  Thank God, bless you, Trump.
[02:03:03.857 --> 02:03:08.458]  Absolutely, and Brexit was an example to Trump, and we're all doing this together, and you're right.
[02:03:08.458 --> 02:03:11.159]  The energy level of liberty is rising, and they can feel it.
[02:03:11.159 --> 02:03:13.920]  Thank God for Nigel Farage and all the other great patriots.
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:15.700]  God bless you from Australia.
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:16.740]  Appreciate you, Patrick.
[02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:17.221]  You're awesome.
[02:03:17.221 --> 02:03:20.101]  All right, let's go to Jim in California.
[02:03:20.101 --> 02:03:20.782]  Jim, you're on the air.
[02:03:20.782 --> 02:03:22.162]  Go ahead.
[02:03:22.162 --> 02:03:22.722]  How you doing?
[02:03:22.722 --> 02:03:23.762]  Good, my friend.
[02:03:23.762 --> 02:03:23.982]  Go ahead.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.201]  I want to thank you for the red pill I got quite a few years ago.
[02:03:30.201 --> 02:03:32.082]  I've called and talked to you before.
[02:03:32.082 --> 02:03:37.023]  And one of the things I was... write this down if you care.
[02:03:37.023 --> 02:03:39.244]  There was a really good song that fits your program.
[02:03:39.244 --> 02:03:41.004]  It's by Triumph.
[02:03:41.004 --> 02:03:43.125]  And it's called Fight the Good Fight.
[02:03:43.125 --> 02:03:43.745]  We have that.
[02:03:43.745 --> 02:03:47.286]  We have Fight the Good Fight in the computer.
[02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:48.446]  We'll come in with Fight the Good Fight.
[02:03:48.446 --> 02:03:49.007]  It's a great song.
[02:03:49.007 --> 02:03:49.747]  I just haven't heard it.
[02:03:49.747 --> 02:03:50.727]  That's why I brought it up.
[02:03:50.727 --> 02:03:53.448]  What I was bringing up, what I was going to talk to you about was the...
[02:03:54.864 --> 02:04:00.049]  He's a not-so-whacko kid, and some would expect it happened.
[02:04:00.049 --> 02:04:12.920]  I've been a Bible reader and studier for many years, and you know that the word, the root word that Satan comes from is liar, and devil is manslayer.
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:18.765]  And so if you think about that for a minute, then you think about what is the theme of the Bible.
[02:04:18.765 --> 02:04:20.647]  You know, every book's got a theme, and
[02:04:21.314 --> 02:04:22.375]  What's the theme of the Bible?
[02:04:22.375 --> 02:04:24.216]  Well, it's God's Kingdom.
[02:04:24.216 --> 02:04:35.403]  It's how we started out perfect, then chose of our own free will, or at least our parents did, to do the wrong thing.
[02:04:35.403 --> 02:04:44.168]  And so he could have ended it right there, but then people would have been saying, hey, you know, you didn't give us enough time to figure out how to govern ourselves.
[02:04:44.168 --> 02:04:47.370]  So we've now had 6,000 years, if you go by Bible time.
[02:04:47.370 --> 02:04:48.471]  I know people argue with that.
[02:04:48.991 --> 02:04:50.111]  No, it's Powerful Info.
[02:04:50.111 --> 02:04:50.551]  Stay there.
[02:04:50.551 --> 02:04:51.551]  I got a guest coming up.
[02:04:51.551 --> 02:04:52.792]  We're going to take a few calls, too.
[02:04:52.792 --> 02:04:56.532]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.532 --> 02:04:58.873]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[02:04:58.873 --> 02:05:04.634]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[02:06:12.595 --> 02:06:16.122]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:16.122 --> 02:06:20.229]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:30.592 --> 02:06:32.254]  Alright, we're now into the third hour.
[02:06:32.254 --> 02:06:50.510]  Godfrey Bloom, former member of the EU Parliament, one of the great leaders in UKIP, one of the great associates of Nigel Farage, he's with us and I'm looking in the future to try to start more broadcasts, have some podcasts that are hosted out of the UK, trying to build a news division there.
[02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:56.255]  Paul Watson does a great job and he's going to be involved in that, so we're trying to work more with Godfrey Bloom, introducing him to our audience.
[02:06:57.236 --> 02:07:00.758]  He has hundreds of millions of views for all his great videos online.
[02:07:00.758 --> 02:07:03.879]  He is a military historian, a veteran, a patriot.
[02:07:03.879 --> 02:07:07.661]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but godfreybloom.uk.
[02:07:07.661 --> 02:07:10.222]  And our fight against the EU is critical.
[02:07:10.222 --> 02:07:14.224]  They're in trade wars with the UK, trade wars with the US.
[02:07:14.224 --> 02:07:16.625]  It's an unelected criminal group.
[02:07:16.625 --> 02:07:18.205]  You may say, well wait, he was elected to their parliament.
[02:07:18.205 --> 02:07:18.906]  That's ceremonial.
[02:07:19.486 --> 02:07:22.388]  I mean, they're advisory to the permanent EU.
[02:07:22.388 --> 02:07:24.290]  That's a communist system, basically.
[02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:31.475]  Like the Central Committee and the Politburo, then you can, you know, have a president or have some other advisory group, but it's just that.
[02:07:31.475 --> 02:07:43.425]  And I've got a bunch of stuff I want to cover with him, but for Americans thinking, man, they're attacking Trump, they're trying to kill the economy, you know, it's really neck and neck who's going to win this thing.
[02:07:43.425 --> 02:07:44.706]  Not when you pull back globally.
[02:07:45.737 --> 02:08:06.059]  And you've got nationalism, you've got the rediscovery of free market capitalism, you've got anti-globalism, anti-sorosism, really exploding from Latin America to Africa to Asia, but in Europe, because of the Islamic invasion and the whole plan to repopulate Europe with Islamists and then make people convert to that,
[02:08:07.282 --> 02:08:10.425]  It is on fire!
[02:08:10.425 --> 02:08:16.009]  So the globalists aren't fighting a one-front war, a two-front war, a three-front war, or a five-front war.
[02:08:16.009 --> 02:08:25.037]  They're fighting with communist China at the heart of it, with the EU, with the corrupt Vatican now captured by the globalists, and the islamicists against the rest of the world.
[02:08:25.037 --> 02:08:26.518]  That's the constellation.
[02:08:26.518 --> 02:08:29.080]  That's the axis of evil we're facing.
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:32.323]  And Mr. Bloom is a great military historian, highly respected.
[02:08:32.323 --> 02:08:34.145]  He can get into any area he wants, but
[02:08:35.174 --> 02:08:40.456]  I remember Nigel Farage and Mr. Bloom 10 years ago warning of the secret EU army plan.
[02:08:40.456 --> 02:08:41.117]  They denied it.
[02:08:41.117 --> 02:08:44.998]  Now they just go, oh, you're going to try to pull out?
[02:08:44.998 --> 02:08:46.919]  We're going to march EU troops in.
[02:08:46.919 --> 02:08:54.182]  We're going to put million euro fines on you, Romania, Hungary, Poland, if you don't let in migrants, which are invaders.
[02:08:54.182 --> 02:08:55.903]  I mean, this, this, the war is now.
[02:08:55.903 --> 02:08:58.064]  They don't label it a war, but it's here.
[02:08:59.471 --> 02:09:08.538]  And so, he's, I want to get into this with him, situation in Italy, where we're having striking victories, a new populist anti-EU government has formed.
[02:09:08.538 --> 02:09:22.168]  And what's beautiful of this is, it's the liberals waking up, being pro-nationalism, anti-open borders, realizing they're going to all be bankrupted, with the right-wing government, and Mr. Bloom is an expert on that, knowing many of the people in Italy and members of the EU Parliament.
[02:09:22.168 --> 02:09:27.071]  So, the fight is on, corporate media, corporatist globalist media will try to black all this out.
[02:09:27.972 --> 02:09:37.416]  Despite all the censorship, despite all the disinformation, despite all the intimidation, despite conservatives being banned and censored across the internet and punished monetarily, we are growing stronger.
[02:09:37.416 --> 02:09:45.899]  Like, when the Nazis, and I don't just say this because he's British, it's a great historical parallel, the Brits weren't sure they wanted to have a fight with Hitler.
[02:09:45.899 --> 02:09:53.662]  And, you know, Dunkirk, you know, you got people leaving and you've got the head of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Goering, just saying, oh, let's just have some target practice.
[02:09:55.290 --> 02:10:01.716]  And Hitler not even wanting to, you know, put half a million troops or whatever in prisoner war camps, he thought England would just sit it out.
[02:10:01.716 --> 02:10:06.860]  Well, there was debates about sitting it out until he began to bomb the civilian targets.
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:12.305]  And that's the thing about these bullies and tyrants and people like Hillary and Soros showing us the rest of it.
[02:10:12.305 --> 02:10:16.949]  They think that when they attack us, that it makes us go away.
[02:10:16.949 --> 02:10:18.471]  They think when we used to be asleep,
[02:10:21.369 --> 02:10:23.210]  That their intimidation had made us cower.
[02:10:23.210 --> 02:10:23.671]  No, no.
[02:10:23.671 --> 02:10:26.532]  They're slapping us in the face and pissing on us.
[02:10:26.532 --> 02:10:28.133]  Woke us up.
[02:10:28.133 --> 02:10:33.636]  Now, it doesn't matter what they do, we're on a rampage of restoring what works.
[02:10:33.636 --> 02:10:35.237]  So, that's my bottom line.
[02:10:35.237 --> 02:10:38.839]  Mr. Bloom, I just wanted to announce how exciting it is this is going on.
[02:10:38.839 --> 02:10:41.601]  GodfreyBloom.UK, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:10:41.601 --> 02:10:44.102]  What do you make of my rant?
[02:10:44.102 --> 02:10:45.003]  Oh, good morning.
[02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:48.345]  Yeah, really very interesting and getting more interesting.
[02:10:49.409 --> 02:10:51.129]  By the week, isn't it?
[02:10:51.129 --> 02:11:03.892]  We now see, do we not, perhaps one of the biggest disconnects between the political class and the people in the Western industrial democracies.
[02:11:03.892 --> 02:11:12.293]  You've got your political class and your bureaucracy saying one thing and doing one thing, and the people doing another.
[02:11:12.293 --> 02:11:18.054]  So it's a classic case over here, for example, in Great Britain, where we had our referendum to leave the European Union.
[02:11:20.081 --> 02:11:22.502]  17 million plus people voted to leave.
[02:11:22.502 --> 02:11:25.863]  That was won by the people who wanted to leave.
[02:11:25.863 --> 02:11:34.886]  In the teeth of the opposition from mainstream media, the bureaucracy, and years and years and years of propaganda.
[02:11:34.886 --> 02:11:39.348]  So consequently, what is quite fascinating is that the people still didn't fall for it.
[02:11:39.348 --> 02:11:40.708]  They still voted to leave.
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:42.701]  Now, that was two years ago.
[02:11:42.701 --> 02:11:44.081]  That was two years ago.
[02:11:44.081 --> 02:11:49.444]  What's happening now, of course, is it's being blocked by the political class.
[02:11:49.444 --> 02:11:56.928]  Two years ago, we're not one tiny bit, we're not one tiny bit further to leaving the European Union than we were two years ago.
[02:11:56.928 --> 02:11:59.809]  But that only illustrates that this is a real authoritarian system.
[02:12:01.395 --> 02:12:02.757]  Yes, it does.
[02:12:02.757 --> 02:12:16.537]  And of course, the ruling class, the political class, have more in common with each other, so your ruling bureaucrat and politician has, a Brit, has more in common with a Frenchman or a Spaniard or a German than he does with his own people.
[02:12:17.337 --> 02:12:19.218]  And they live in their own bubbles.
[02:12:19.218 --> 02:12:24.659]  You know we have that splendid institution, the pub, over here in England.
[02:12:24.659 --> 02:12:27.700]  You will never find a politician in a pub.
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:32.642]  And that's a great shame because that's where you learn what people are actually thinking.
[02:12:32.642 --> 02:12:37.763]  And by the way, I notice no EU bureaucratic leaders in the permanent state even have children.
[02:12:37.763 --> 02:12:38.723]  They don't go to pubs.
[02:12:38.723 --> 02:12:39.404]  They don't have children.
[02:12:39.404 --> 02:12:40.044]  They're dead.
[02:12:40.044 --> 02:12:40.704]  What's wrong with them?
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:43.780]  Well, they are zealots.
[02:12:43.780 --> 02:13:07.946]  What has actually happened, of course, and you made reference to the Catholic Church a little bit earlier, what's happened is that when you become a secular state, when you become a secular state, which the European Union is, it's a super state, but it's a state nevertheless, what actually happens, it becomes secular and so consequently the new super state becomes the religion.
[02:13:08.584 --> 02:13:11.967]  That's religion.
[02:13:11.967 --> 02:13:15.269]  People now don't go to church very much anymore.
[02:13:15.269 --> 02:13:20.073]  Religion is generally falling, so people embrace something new.
[02:13:20.073 --> 02:13:25.718]  And this is where the bureaucrats, your high priests of the bureaucracy, have actually gone.
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:29.642]  It's a rather interesting phenomenon.
[02:13:29.642 --> 02:13:30.122]  That's right.
[02:13:30.122 --> 02:13:33.386]  I mean, they admit political correctness is the new religion.
[02:13:33.386 --> 02:13:35.929]  World government corporatism is the religion.
[02:13:35.929 --> 02:13:40.034]  The big corporate heads, none of them even pay taxes, but want poor people to have their taxes raised.
[02:13:40.034 --> 02:13:47.062]  Like Bloomberg said, I mean, this is just a horrible, evil group claiming they're atheist, but really they're Satanist.
[02:13:47.062 --> 02:13:47.963]  They want to be God.
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:50.861]  Well, yes.
[02:13:50.861 --> 02:13:55.545]  Of course, what is interesting is that the bureaucracy in the European Union don't pay tax.
[02:13:55.545 --> 02:13:58.527]  They have a special rate.
[02:13:58.527 --> 02:13:59.848]  It starts at 120,000.
[02:13:59.848 --> 02:14:06.813]  You have your first 120,000 euros a year tax-free, and the rest is at a composite rate of 10%.
[02:14:06.813 --> 02:14:09.035]  They have non-contributing pension schemes, these people.
[02:14:09.295 --> 02:14:10.417]  Let me say that again.
[02:14:10.417 --> 02:14:19.008]  They've got income taxes at 101% for some groups in France, but the EU bureaucrats, you heard me right, the EU bureaucrats have it set at 10%.
[02:14:19.008 --> 02:14:22.914]  I mean, they're the new royalty, really.
[02:14:24.247 --> 02:14:34.234]  Oh yes, they are, and of course I made a speech in the chamber about this subject about four years ago, and would you believe it had over 30 million hits worldwide.
[02:14:34.234 --> 02:14:41.299]  A lot of people, you know, still don't know that these characters, these spivs, these crooks, these gangsters, don't pay tax.
[02:14:41.299 --> 02:14:44.801]  And I actually exposed them when they were having a debate about tax evasion.
[02:14:44.801 --> 02:14:51.586]  Would you believe the almighty crust of these people having a debate about tax evasion when they were the biggest tax evaders on the face of the planet?
[02:14:53.683 --> 02:14:59.405]  Their desire for power is only outmatched by the hubris and the hypocrisy, and that they get away with it.
[02:14:59.405 --> 02:15:07.048]  I mean, if you look at Bezos, Bezos, and all these big billionaires, they pay almost zero tax, they get the laws written, and then Bloomberg does the same thing.
[02:15:07.048 --> 02:15:13.991]  He totally avoids most his taxes, and then he lectures that poor people need to pay more yesterday at an economic forum.
[02:15:13.991 --> 02:15:18.653]  He said it's good for them when any economist will tell you, you shouldn't even tax poor people.
[02:15:20.311 --> 02:15:21.231]  Well, of course, absolutely.
[02:15:21.231 --> 02:15:28.514]  And, of course, the other great religion is climate change, which, of course, we all now know to be completely bogus.
[02:15:28.514 --> 02:15:34.755]  And so you get the great and the good flying all over the place in their jets, telling us we can't go on holiday because we're polluting the atmosphere.
[02:15:34.755 --> 02:15:36.076]  Absolutely extraordinary!
[02:15:36.576 --> 02:15:38.577]  Well, this is the big enchilada.
[02:15:38.577 --> 02:15:43.060]  The globalists pay almost no tax, but lecture some middle-class family all day they need to pay more.
[02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:52.026]  We're back with Godfrey Bloom on the other side to cover the real global revolution against the billionaires pushing collectivism, but not for themselves.
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:58.462]  Bacon lovers, we ship free.

[02:19:59.339 --> 02:20:01.942]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.996 --> 02:20:21.608]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:21.608 --> 02:20:23.054]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.152 --> 02:20:28.935]  That's why we're under attack, but we are winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:28.935 --> 02:20:31.837]  But all over the Western world, draconian censorship is here.
[02:20:31.837 --> 02:20:36.842]  The globalists are saying you can't say the word Jesus in your commencement speech.
[02:20:36.842 --> 02:20:41.306]  And major, you know, universities and high schools, they are attacking the family.
[02:20:41.306 --> 02:20:44.629]  Canada is saying don't say mother or father on any type of forms.
[02:20:44.629 --> 02:20:46.451]  It's hurtful to say there's a mother and father.
[02:20:46.451 --> 02:20:48.293]  This is cult level.
[02:20:48.293 --> 02:20:50.055]  And Godfrey Bloom went right at the heart of it.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:56.163]  Political correctness, global warming, all this stuff, now it's climate change.
[02:20:56.163 --> 02:20:57.343]  Well, of course we know there's climate change.
[02:20:57.343 --> 02:21:01.106]  We're just saying paying you a global carbon tax doesn't fix it.
[02:21:01.106 --> 02:21:02.506]  The only constant is change.
[02:21:02.506 --> 02:21:12.913]  Godfrey Bloom, military historian, former member of the EU Parliament, his speeches are right up there with those of Nigel Farage and the great dynamic duo.
[02:21:12.913 --> 02:21:20.257]  You were getting into this religion and how do we counter it, how it's now challenging free speech to try to stop us, its alliance with Islam.
[02:21:20.257 --> 02:21:20.998]  As a historian,
[02:21:21.857 --> 02:21:23.358]  Those that know the past know the future.
[02:21:23.358 --> 02:21:28.161]  This is a big question, I should have asked this two weeks ago, and I should have come on so you can think about it.
[02:21:28.161 --> 02:21:33.545]  Looking into your crystal ball, economically, militarily, all of it's the same thing.
[02:21:33.545 --> 02:21:38.968]  The EU, all these authoritarian regimes are arrogant, but the cracks go to their foundations.
[02:21:38.968 --> 02:21:44.092]  There really cannot be propped up without total war, and that itself will fail.
[02:21:44.092 --> 02:21:46.974]  So I just don't understand why they don't run the white flag up, and I think it's because
[02:21:47.779 --> 02:21:52.161]  The very criminal nature of it is they don't care as individuals.
[02:21:52.161 --> 02:21:58.045]  They will extract through the system as long as they can, even though it's destroying the very system that gives them power.
[02:21:58.045 --> 02:22:04.849]  There is a ignorance to evil, I think, that they don't have the big, large, fourth, fifth, six-dimensional understanding.
[02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:14.354]  So if you could quantify, finishing up on your religion comment, the new religions, which are really just the old religions, brought back, and looking into the future, what you project is going to happen?
[02:22:16.518 --> 02:22:19.119]  Well, these things, generally speaking, are cyclical.
[02:22:19.119 --> 02:22:26.582]  And, of course, in the old days, your medieval king raised taxes to go to war for his own personal benefit.
[02:22:26.582 --> 02:22:28.863]  And he was quite honest about it.
[02:22:28.863 --> 02:22:31.224]  And if you didn't pay your taxes, he'd chop your head off.
[02:22:31.224 --> 02:22:32.724]  And that was that.
[02:22:32.724 --> 02:22:34.825]  And he went on after war.
[02:22:34.825 --> 02:22:40.988]  Now we have a different system now of tax, where they try and tell us that taking tax from us is for our own benefit.
[02:22:40.988 --> 02:22:44.329]  We are somehow supposed to be grateful for them taking tax away from us.
[02:22:45.069 --> 02:22:50.074]  And of course then they squander it, or worse still, they actually misappropriate it.
[02:22:50.074 --> 02:22:51.555]  And we were warned about this.
[02:22:51.555 --> 02:22:52.756]  America was warned about it.
[02:22:52.756 --> 02:22:59.022]  The free world was warned about this by General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower as he then was.
[02:22:59.022 --> 02:23:02.826]  He warned us of the industrial military complex, did he not?
[02:23:02.826 --> 02:23:06.910]  The industrial, and the full title was the Industrial Military and Congressional Congress.
[02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:12.716]  Where the budget now in the United States is nearly a trillion pounds a year.
[02:23:12.716 --> 02:23:14.899]  And yet the Cold War finished years ago.
[02:23:14.899 --> 02:23:19.324]  The Soviet, the Russians actually cut last year their budget, their defence budget, by 20%.
[02:23:21.536 --> 02:23:27.960]  One asks oneself, why does America need 11 aircraft carrier groups?
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:31.622]  Why are they taxing everybody for this military complex?
[02:23:31.622 --> 02:23:34.184]  And it's just the same in the United Kingdom.
[02:23:34.184 --> 02:23:36.565]  We've now got two aircraft carrier groups.
[02:23:36.565 --> 02:23:38.546]  The Lord only knows what we're supposed to do with them.
[02:23:38.546 --> 02:23:41.928]  We don't even have any airplanes to fly off them at the moment.
[02:23:41.928 --> 02:23:43.689]  So the whole thing becomes self-funding.
[02:23:45.530 --> 02:23:47.631]  I don't know quite where it's going to end.
[02:23:47.631 --> 02:23:49.132]  I hope it doesn't end in war.
[02:23:49.132 --> 02:23:52.935]  But you and I both know, and your listeners know, there's a determination.
[02:23:52.935 --> 02:23:59.459]  There's a determination on war by a clique in America.
[02:23:59.459 --> 02:24:01.420]  And the British go along with it.
[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:02.241]  We're your lap dogs.
[02:24:03.672 --> 02:24:05.453]  Well that was my next question!
[02:24:05.453 --> 02:24:06.454]  You look at Bolton...
[02:24:32.913 --> 02:24:33.213]  Exactly.
[02:24:33.213 --> 02:24:38.936]  You look at Bolton openly trying to sabotage the North Korean, South Korean peace deal.
[02:24:38.936 --> 02:24:42.218]  You look at this new CIA director.
[02:24:42.218 --> 02:24:49.121]  The president's smart on his ideas and who he is, but the sophistication of all this and how deep the swamp is, you're right.
[02:24:49.121 --> 02:24:55.384]  He is beginning to go somewhat sideways on the whole... I mean, we should be out of Afghanistan.
[02:24:55.384 --> 02:24:57.385]  What, the longest war in world history?
[02:24:59.387 --> 02:25:01.890]  Well, of course, we fought four times in Afghanistan.
[02:25:01.890 --> 02:25:04.654]  We had four wars in Afghanistan.
[02:25:04.654 --> 02:25:06.436]  The Russians had one.
[02:25:06.436 --> 02:25:10.901]  You would think sometimes we'd sit round the table, wouldn't you, and think that it's an unwinnable situation.
[02:25:10.901 --> 02:25:16.387]  I was in Afghanistan two or three years ago with the RAF Regiment, so I saw it all first-hand.
[02:25:16.387 --> 02:25:18.950]  Did Alexander the Great finally fail in Afghanistan too?
[02:25:19.831 --> 02:25:25.512]  Everybody fails in Afghanistan and the reason is there's nothing there except, you know, it's just mountains and mum.
[02:25:25.512 --> 02:25:26.413]  There's nothing there.
[02:25:26.413 --> 02:25:29.553]  How do you conquer a bunch of cavemen?
[02:25:29.553 --> 02:25:32.454]  People don't even know about the Afghan culture.
[02:25:32.454 --> 02:25:33.134]  It's bizarre.
[02:25:33.134 --> 02:25:36.315]  They keep the boys as girls and the men wear dresses.
[02:25:36.315 --> 02:25:37.935]  It's just a lunatic asylum.
[02:25:37.935 --> 02:25:39.576]  I mean, why would anybody even want that?
[02:25:39.576 --> 02:25:41.276]  Because I guess it's between all those key countries?
[02:25:42.825 --> 02:25:48.806]  Well, it was a buffer zone for the British, of course, in the last century, or the century before last, the 19th century.
[02:25:48.806 --> 02:25:53.467]  It was a buffer zone, and the Russians and the British used to squabble over it and infiltrate.
[02:25:53.467 --> 02:25:54.787]  It was called the Great Game.
[02:25:54.787 --> 02:25:56.347]  There are some fascinating books on this.
[02:25:56.347 --> 02:26:00.408]  It's called The Great Game, and it's well worth looking up.
[02:26:00.408 --> 02:26:03.469]  But this is now happening all over the place.
[02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:07.629]  I just did an essay, you can find it on my website, called Spheres of Influence.
[02:26:07.629 --> 02:26:11.790]  And what's happened since the end of the Cold War, we've thrown away the rulebook.
[02:26:12.310 --> 02:26:14.151]  We all knew what we were doing.
[02:26:14.151 --> 02:26:20.193]  The bad guys were the Soviets on the one side, the good guys were us, NATO, on the other side.
[02:26:20.193 --> 02:26:23.894]  The good guys had the white hats, the bad guys had the black hats.
[02:26:23.894 --> 02:26:25.635]  And we all knew where we were.
[02:26:25.635 --> 02:26:30.576]  And we were very careful how we played the game, because it could end in nuclear conflict.
[02:26:30.576 --> 02:26:37.418]  We seem to have thrown the rule out of the way now, and we seem to have people running the show who come straight out of Doctor Strangelove.
[02:26:37.418 --> 02:26:40.179]  I don't know, a lot of your listeners won't be old enough
[02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:44.002]  Animals will be bred.
[02:26:44.002 --> 02:26:46.083]  Animals will be slaughtered.
[02:26:46.083 --> 02:26:48.765]  Of course we can live underground for many years.
[02:26:48.765 --> 02:26:51.267]  There will be a ratio of 10 to 1 female-male.
[02:26:51.267 --> 02:26:57.532]  They will have to be selected for their stimulating qualities.
[02:26:57.532 --> 02:27:01.115]  Mandrake, Mandrake, get over here with that belt, boy!
[02:27:01.115 --> 02:27:02.716]  Me with the gun, you with the belt.
[02:27:02.716 --> 02:27:04.437]  Feeding, feeding me, Mandrake.
[02:27:04.437 --> 02:27:06.399]  Mandrake, you know I only drink rainwater.
[02:27:07.443 --> 02:27:13.544]  The Americans voted for Trump because his manifesto said he was going to do something about it.
[02:27:13.544 --> 02:27:15.244]  And it's the same with us.
[02:27:15.244 --> 02:27:16.605]  I'm not having a pop at America.
[02:27:16.605 --> 02:27:18.145]  I'm not having a pop at Trump.
[02:27:18.145 --> 02:27:19.725]  It's just the same here.
[02:27:19.725 --> 02:27:24.646]  We have a Prime Minister who's surrounded herself by deep state representatives.
[02:27:24.646 --> 02:27:31.247]  Her advisor on Brexit is a man called Ollie Robbins who's devoted his entire life to the European Union.
[02:27:31.247 --> 02:27:34.408]  The whole civil service is devoted to the European Union.
[02:27:34.408 --> 02:27:36.148]  You couldn't get promoted in the European Union
[02:27:37.229 --> 02:27:43.253]  Let me ask you this.
[02:27:43.253 --> 02:27:46.255]  I'm talking about politically, not just militarily.
[02:27:46.255 --> 02:27:58.425]  With these authoritarian regimes in decline, following the classic pattern of becoming more authoritarian as they're in decline, which guarantees the acceleration towards their demise, except for all the super weapons we've got now,
[02:27:59.245 --> 02:28:01.266]  It just, I mean, this is insane.
[02:28:01.266 --> 02:28:02.467]  This does not look good.
[02:28:02.467 --> 02:28:04.628]  I mean, it looks very explosive.
[02:28:04.628 --> 02:28:08.350]  The future looks very explosive.
[02:28:08.350 --> 02:28:16.314]  It's rather sad, because if you look historically, when you see an empire collapse, it's normally followed by either two things.
[02:28:16.314 --> 02:28:20.436]  Either another empire, or a dark age.
[02:28:20.436 --> 02:28:23.977]  And I'm sorry to say, I think we're probably going for a dark age.
[02:28:23.977 --> 02:28:25.098]  A new dark age.
[02:28:26.471 --> 02:28:31.714]  And Trump, at least in his rhetoric, and others are trying to pull us out of a new dark age.
[02:28:31.714 --> 02:28:41.820]  And let's look at the permutation of that dark age, because the globalists have decided on a breakaway civilization, new dark age, Elysium scenario.
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:44.141]  And now you're going to the heart of their master plan.
[02:28:44.141 --> 02:28:49.464]  They have decided to control the crash of civilization and depopulation into a new dark age.
[02:28:49.464 --> 02:28:51.085]  Emergency transmission straight ahead.
[02:28:55.370 --> 02:29:06.755]  If you or anyone you love has been diagnosed with lung cancer, asbestosis, or mesothelioma, your diagnosis may be the result of job-related exposure to asbestos, and you may be entitled to compensation.
[02:29:06.755 --> 02:29:11.977]  Over $30 billion in trusts have been set aside for individuals who have been affected by asbestos exposure.
[02:29:11.977 --> 02:29:14.939]  How do you protect your rights and get the compensation you deserve?
[02:29:14.939 --> 02:29:16.579]  Call Capital Legal Group now at 800-400-LUNG.
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:18.580]  I think so.
[02:29:39.457 --> 02:29:40.058]  We're good to go.

[02:31:47.801 --> 02:31:50.702]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:31:50.702 --> 02:31:53.503]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:31:53.503 --> 02:31:55.684]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:31:55.684 --> 02:31:58.745]  Western Europe has already banned free speech.
[02:31:58.745 --> 02:32:03.326]  And an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:32:03.326 --> 02:32:11.249]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:32:11.249 --> 02:32:14.330]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:19.615]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:32:19.615 --> 02:32:23.739]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:32:23.739 --> 02:32:26.883]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:32:26.883 --> 02:32:31.648]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:32:31.648 --> 02:32:34.691]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:32:35.091 --> 02:32:49.940]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:51.721]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:32:51.721 --> 02:32:59.345]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:32:59.345 --> 02:33:01.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:07.822 --> 02:33:11.723]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.723 --> 02:33:18.105]  When I die and God pulls that gate, I want to go for 8.
[02:33:18.105 --> 02:33:19.825]  Infinity.
[02:33:36.218 --> 02:33:41.941]  Alright, Godfrey Blum, I'm going to have him host a couple of segments because that way you'll get to hear him yourself.
[02:33:41.941 --> 02:33:46.803]  In those segments, this segment, part of this segment, the next, maybe five minutes to the next hour ahead of our next host.
[02:33:48.758 --> 02:33:50.199]  He wants to take a few of your calls.
[02:33:50.199 --> 02:33:54.980]  And there's a bunch of callers already holding that want to talk about geopolitical stuff like Carlos and others.
[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:56.901]  So if you want to talk to Richard Bloom, we'll keep you on hold.
[02:33:56.901 --> 02:33:58.782]  If not, I'm sorry, the other callers, we're out of time.
[02:33:58.782 --> 02:34:02.123]  I'm going to flush those calls.
[02:34:02.123 --> 02:34:04.904]  Not that you're flushable, but you're on other topics to talk to me.
[02:34:04.904 --> 02:34:07.905]  If you want to talk to Godfrey Bloom, he'll take a few of your calls.
[02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:09.506]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:34:09.506 --> 02:34:09.586]  877-789-2539.
[02:34:09.586 --> 02:34:09.726]  877-789-2539.
[02:34:09.726 --> 02:34:10.626]  One of the hardest fighters.
[02:34:18.210 --> 02:34:20.718]  For nationalism, for patriotism, for libertarianism.
[02:34:21.946 --> 02:34:25.869]  In the whole global system against the New World Order.
[02:34:25.869 --> 02:34:28.911]  And again, it was the whole Brexit model that led to what we've seen with Trump.
[02:34:28.911 --> 02:34:32.593]  We're talking about Trump leading the way globally against this, and we hope he stays true to that.
[02:34:32.593 --> 02:34:33.994]  He's starting to falter a bit.
[02:34:33.994 --> 02:34:35.935]  We understand he's under tremendous pressure.
[02:34:35.935 --> 02:34:40.258]  It's the ideology he's pushing, though, that is the very, very positive part of it.
[02:34:40.258 --> 02:34:49.044]  And so I support the president 100 percent, and I pledged to him personally that I'm going to support what he's doing, the operations.
[02:34:49.044 --> 02:34:50.645]  They're going to try to destroy me one way or the other.
[02:34:50.905 --> 02:34:53.806]  Even if I was to turn on the President, which I'll never do.
[02:34:53.806 --> 02:35:02.951]  So, there's a problem though, being totally committed now, that as he starts to go sideways some, I'm having some real moral issues, which I've never had in my life.
[02:35:02.951 --> 02:35:07.152]  I've never been so committed to something at a point, but that's a whole other discussion for another day.
[02:35:07.152 --> 02:35:09.974]  Briefly, if you don't support us,
[02:35:10.942 --> 02:35:17.285]  And their disinformation campaigns, I mean, because as fast as they file lawsuits, we get them dismissed, they file more, as you saw yesterday.
[02:35:17.285 --> 02:35:21.888]  It is a way of just publishing lies to then have the media driving through the mud.
[02:35:21.888 --> 02:35:26.610]  It doesn't work with our listeners or our affiliates, but it takes time and money with the lawyers.
[02:35:26.610 --> 02:35:32.293]  So if you will stand with us and if you will financially support us, we won't just stay where we're at.
[02:35:32.293 --> 02:35:33.433]  We're going to expand to 24 hours a day.
[02:35:35.254 --> 02:35:38.055]  And they know we're getting a lot of TV stations right now, we're exploding.
[02:35:38.055 --> 02:35:42.475]  But TV station viewers, you know, don't really buy anything, okay?
[02:35:42.475 --> 02:35:45.656]  So again, you hear radio sponsors, you see local sponsors, that's their sponsors.
[02:35:45.656 --> 02:35:48.656]  With us, 80% of the money is you buying products.
[02:35:48.656 --> 02:35:50.097]  So, and we make it easy, man.
[02:35:50.097 --> 02:35:55.898]  Whatever the top filter at the lowest price says for air in your house, we got it, Lexapir.
[02:35:55.898 --> 02:35:57.498]  Whatever the best storable food is, we got it.
[02:35:57.498 --> 02:35:59.278]  Whatever the best shortwave radios, we got it.
[02:35:59.278 --> 02:36:01.199]  Whatever the best tactical gear, we got it.
[02:36:01.199 --> 02:36:03.219]  Whatever the best water filtration, we go out, we get it.
[02:36:04.568 --> 02:36:08.410]  And we give it to you at a super low price, a lot of times even lower than Amazon can.
[02:36:08.410 --> 02:36:10.591]  And he's got all the government perks and the rest of it we don't.
[02:36:10.591 --> 02:36:14.673]  We have free shipping on all of our best-selling items at infowarestore.com right now.
[02:36:14.673 --> 02:36:21.836]  I'm not gonna list them all so Godfrey Bloom has time to get into this whole dark age we're facing that the globalists have talked about they're gonna institute.
[02:36:21.836 --> 02:36:30.380]  But BrainForce, X2, AlphaBrain, SuperMail, ImmuneWall, PolymBlock, it's all 50% off and free shipping.
[02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:32.301]  I don't have time to get into all the rave reviews.
[02:36:33.427 --> 02:36:36.169]  It's Memorial Day special.
[02:36:36.169 --> 02:36:37.730]  We're running it through Memorial Day.
[02:36:37.730 --> 02:36:41.893]  And listen, as long as you stand with us, we're going to expand in the face of the enemy.
[02:36:41.893 --> 02:36:46.976]  So you give us the seed money while you get great products at the same time, we will expand.
[02:36:46.976 --> 02:36:52.700]  And we have all sorts of innovations and things we want to implement, but it's up to you to support us.
[02:36:52.700 --> 02:37:00.886]  So please make the decision and commit to buy products, to sign up for AutoShip on some of the stuff like supplements or our great coffee.
[02:37:02.133 --> 02:37:04.734]  Wake Up America Coffee, the kind of stuff you're going to reorder.
[02:37:04.734 --> 02:37:10.595]  You get 10% off additionally, so it's a win-win for supporting us so that you don't forget about supporting us each month.
[02:37:10.595 --> 02:37:11.415]  Please commit today.
[02:37:11.415 --> 02:37:12.595]  It's never been easier.
[02:37:12.595 --> 02:37:14.976]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:37:14.976 --> 02:37:16.796]  Okay, you heard my point.
[02:37:16.796 --> 02:37:24.797]  I'm going to hand the baton to you, and you can go wherever you want here, because I just want to sit back before I go to a meeting and just hear what you have to say.
[02:37:24.797 --> 02:37:26.918]  I do this occasionally, so maybe I'll shut up.
[02:37:27.518 --> 02:37:34.427]  Godfrey Blum, former member of the EU Parliament, author, military historian of folks who's joined us.
[02:37:34.427 --> 02:37:35.067]  Exactly.
[02:37:35.067 --> 02:37:36.089]  Empires love them, hate them.
[02:37:36.089 --> 02:37:36.790]  Good ones, bad ones.
[02:37:39.130 --> 02:37:42.932]  When they collapse, there's a bunch of wars over who's going to be the new empire.
[02:37:42.932 --> 02:37:43.832]  That almost always happens.
[02:37:43.832 --> 02:37:50.956]  And then if that fails, you break into little sub-districts, and then you end up having a dark age, and things get really barbarous.
[02:37:50.956 --> 02:37:55.338]  So, look at the Romans have to do, the aqueduct.
[02:37:55.338 --> 02:37:58.659]  It gets into a Monty Python skit at that point.
[02:37:58.659 --> 02:38:01.001]  But this globalism is an evil empire.
[02:38:01.001 --> 02:38:04.482]  If there ever was one, probably more evil than the Soviet Union, because it's more sophisticated.
[02:38:08.365 --> 02:38:34.801]  How do we avert that and not have the corporate global empire, but then get back to a multipolar world about space exploration and a future when the globalists have decided to have a breakaway civilization, exempt themselves from taxes, give themselves diplomatic immunity, as you pointed out in Parliament years ago, make themselves the new royalty, but they don't have to lead the armies, no one even knows who they are, they're just broken away with their cloud cities, basically, as an allegory of Elysium.
[02:38:35.621 --> 02:38:37.083]  And that's their words.
[02:38:37.083 --> 02:38:47.632]  And then we're just all down here with a police state over us that they control via a remote-controlled technocracy where even decision-making is removed and men aren't even in the military anymore.
[02:38:47.632 --> 02:38:50.915]  I mean, this is a humanity-ending scenario we've reached.
[02:38:50.915 --> 02:38:58.061]  So let's look at the bleak future from a military historian, highly respected view on the new dark age that your own Ministry of Defense in 2007 projected by 2022
[02:39:01.624 --> 02:39:04.945]  If globalism didn't stop breaking its promises.
[02:39:04.945 --> 02:39:07.326]  Well, we know it was always designed to break the promises.
[02:39:07.326 --> 02:39:10.606]  This is why it's being abandoned by people throughout the system.
[02:39:10.606 --> 02:39:12.147]  So let's go through that.
[02:39:12.147 --> 02:39:12.427]  Thank you.
[02:39:12.427 --> 02:39:14.467]  Take over.
[02:39:14.467 --> 02:39:19.029]  Well, of course, history will tell us that you learn everything from history, that nothing is new on the face of the earth.
[02:39:19.029 --> 02:39:19.929]  Nothing is new.
[02:39:19.929 --> 02:39:20.769]  You look at history.
[02:39:20.769 --> 02:39:28.731]  So if you look at, let's take Great Britain or Britain as it was then, Romano Britain, when the Roman Empire
[02:39:29.818 --> 02:39:36.560]  The Roman Empire eventually left in about 450 AD because they were overextended.
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:41.702]  Their political system had been totally corrupted and they actually left Great Britain.
[02:39:41.702 --> 02:39:48.283]  And what actually went wrong there is they left an infrastructure but they didn't leave any protection.
[02:39:48.283 --> 02:39:49.664]  And so there was no protection.
[02:39:49.664 --> 02:39:53.305]  So the barbarians came to Great Britain.
[02:39:53.305 --> 02:39:55.585]  The Hun was at the gate of Rome.
[02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:57.126]  The Eternal City fell.
[02:39:57.866 --> 02:40:03.809]  And all these things took place because of the initial corruption of their political system.
[02:40:03.809 --> 02:40:06.070]  And of course the corruption of their currency.
[02:40:06.070 --> 02:40:08.131]  Now that's another interesting thing.
[02:40:08.131 --> 02:40:11.713]  They added alloys to the silver and the gold of their currency.
[02:40:11.713 --> 02:40:14.975]  Which is what we're doing now by what they call quantitative easing.
[02:40:14.975 --> 02:40:18.457]  So we're actually devaluing and degrading our currency.
[02:40:18.457 --> 02:40:23.159]  So they couldn't even buy off the barbarians anymore because the barbarians knew it was crap metal.
[02:40:24.390 --> 02:40:26.091]  Absolutely.
[02:40:26.091 --> 02:40:29.253]  And the whole thing then collapsed.
[02:40:29.253 --> 02:40:33.195]  And then we came through and we had the Saxon period in England.
[02:40:33.195 --> 02:40:35.657]  And of course, actually, that was quite useful.
[02:40:35.657 --> 02:40:39.879]  That was the beginning, as it were, of coming out of the Dark Age.
[02:40:39.879 --> 02:40:42.041]  Well, it was the Saxon period, about 800 to 900 AD.
[02:40:42.041 --> 02:40:46.043]  And that's when common law started.
[02:40:46.798 --> 02:40:48.239]  That's when law started.
[02:40:48.239 --> 02:40:50.060]  That's when natural justice started.
[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:51.722]  And it was in small communities.
[02:40:51.722 --> 02:40:52.822]  It was villages.
[02:40:52.822 --> 02:40:54.904]  And so we need to get back to small.
[02:40:54.904 --> 02:40:59.527]  Big and centralised is bad when it comes to politics or economics or anything.
[02:40:59.527 --> 02:41:01.589]  And gradually we came out of that.
[02:41:01.589 --> 02:41:04.271]  And Europe then drifted towards city-states.
[02:41:04.271 --> 02:41:05.071]  The city-states.
[02:41:05.071 --> 02:41:06.953]  The great Italian Renaissance.
[02:41:06.953 --> 02:41:08.574]  And things like this.
[02:41:08.574 --> 02:41:12.537]  And in this country, and I alluded to it earlier, you put your finger on it.
[02:41:13.198 --> 02:41:14.900]  And that was in 1688.
[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:23.952]  People know we had the Bill of Rights, but what they tend to forget sometimes, because they haven't had the benefit of a traditional education, was the Toleration Acts of about the same time.
[02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:27.791]  Religious Toleration Acts.
[02:41:27.791 --> 02:41:30.272]  So what's actually happened now, we've moved backwards.
[02:41:30.272 --> 02:41:34.414]  We have brought back blasphemy laws after three or four hundred years.
[02:41:34.414 --> 02:41:40.177]  We've brought back blasphemy laws into Great Britain, where you can now go to prison for blasphemy.
[02:41:40.177 --> 02:41:47.340]  But the irony is, it isn't blasphemy against the Christian religion, it's blasphemy against the Islamic religion.
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:56.062]  So, you can say anything you like about Christianity, but you will go straight to prison if you badmouth Islam.
[02:41:56.062 --> 02:41:58.442]  So it isn't even a level playing field.
[02:41:58.442 --> 02:42:04.223]  And this is when society, law and natural justice starts to break down.
[02:42:04.223 --> 02:42:11.925]  Yes, I'm afraid it's a new dark age.
[02:42:11.925 --> 02:42:14.806]  So, how do we come out of this?
[02:42:14.806 --> 02:42:15.826]  How do we come out of this?
[02:42:17.586 --> 02:42:23.587]  Democracy as it was understood in the Athenian time was not for everybody who just attained the age of 18.
[02:42:23.587 --> 02:42:27.128]  It was people who put skin in the game.
[02:42:27.128 --> 02:42:33.349]  So what we've got to do is get our democracy back to people who contribute, not to those people who suck at the public teeth.
[02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:36.090]  They're the ones who are actually draining resources.
[02:42:36.090 --> 02:42:40.671]  We need to give more political power to those people who are creating resources.
[02:42:40.671 --> 02:42:46.012]  So that's really how we need to go about these things, and at the moment it doesn't look like we're even moving in the right direction.
[02:42:46.894 --> 02:42:52.266]  Well, I think we're coming up to the break now, and I hope to talk to some of you as you phone in.
[02:42:55.424 --> 02:42:59.106]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.

[02:47:20.588 --> 02:47:22.049]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:28.044 --> 02:47:29.485]  Well, good day, uh, to you.
[02:47:29.485 --> 02:47:33.669]  This is, uh, Godfrey Bloom, uh, hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:33.669 --> 02:47:35.710]  Uh, I hope you're having a good day.
[02:47:35.710 --> 02:47:36.951]  Uh, I certainly am.
[02:47:36.951 --> 02:47:37.752]  The sun's shining.
[02:47:37.752 --> 02:47:39.474]  I'm talking to you today from Yorkshire.
[02:47:39.474 --> 02:47:43.437]  Uh, I hope, uh, one day you'll get to visit me over here.
[02:47:43.437 --> 02:47:54.186]  Now, I know that some of you are hanging on, and some of you have been hanging on for a while, and I think Carlos, Carlos, you've been hanging on for a while with a question, so perhaps you'd like to fire ahead.
[02:47:54.186 --> 02:47:56.688]  Yes, uh, thank you very much, Mr. Bloom.
[02:47:56.688 --> 02:47:56.748]  Um,
[02:47:57.324 --> 02:48:12.987]  I just wanted to bring up a point, quite important, when you're talking about globalists and globalism as a philosophy and policy, I want to draw attention to a quote that was made to the U.S.
[02:48:12.987 --> 02:48:21.128]  Senate by Mr. James Paul Warburg of the Federal Reserve of the United States.
[02:48:21.128 --> 02:48:24.669]  He said, we shall have world government whether or not we like it.
[02:48:25.359 --> 02:48:32.540]  The only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent.
[02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:51.764]  And the globalists have enjoyed the facility of printing money out of thin air to the tune of quadrupling since the last crisis in 2008 to four point almost five trillion dollars of money printed out of thin air that is now owed.
[02:48:51.764 --> 02:48:53.285]  To whom?
[02:48:53.285 --> 02:48:55.005]  To those who print the money out of thin air.
[02:48:55.868 --> 02:49:16.111]  And the problem is, is that when you have a champion, as you would have in any European country, trying to look for the interests of the nation, it's like having your champion in a poker game, where one of the players can print money out of thin air all night, and if the question is, who is going to win the game?
[02:49:16.815 --> 02:49:20.517]  So in my personal opinion, I agree with you.
[02:49:20.517 --> 02:49:27.762]  They're laughing up their sleeve as they finance Soros or any enterprise anywhere for global control.
[02:49:27.762 --> 02:49:34.126]  And as long as they're able to print money out of thin air, no Trump, no leader in the world can really deal with it.
[02:49:35.683 --> 02:49:54.888]  I'm glad you made the point, Carlos, about the poker game, because I expect many of you will know, but I suspect some of you won't know, what is a rather interesting phenomenon, and that is if you go into a Las Vegas casino, they cannot issue you a plastic chip for $10 or $50 or whatever it happens to be to play
[02:49:55.703 --> 02:50:02.189]  Poker, or the roulette wheel, or indeed anything else, unless they have the bullion downstairs in the vault.
[02:50:02.189 --> 02:50:05.032]  They must have the bullion in order to do that.
[02:50:05.032 --> 02:50:15.542]  And of course, under the old gold system, when the dollar was linked to gold, the Fed couldn't issue a dollar bill unless they had the gold in the vault.
[02:50:15.542 --> 02:50:19.486]  And of course, they moved away from that when Nixon closed the gold window in 1971.
[02:50:21.747 --> 02:50:31.661]  So what you have is this rather extraordinary situation today where your 1971 dollar will only buy you 8 cents worth of goods today.
[02:50:31.661 --> 02:50:38.011]  The worst thing you could possibly do for any politician is give them a money printing machine.
[02:50:39.006 --> 02:50:40.887]  Uh, and no responsibility.
[02:50:40.887 --> 02:50:45.510]  So what they do is they print and they print and print, and they squander it in any event.
[02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:48.912]  And that's what's happened to the Yankee dollar, and that's what's going to happen again.
[02:50:48.912 --> 02:50:53.995]  And this is the protection against possible, uh, global, uh, global government.
[02:50:54.955 --> 02:50:56.678]  Because they can't manage money.
[02:50:56.678 --> 02:50:59.402]  And it was the same way that the Roman Empire collapsed.
[02:50:59.402 --> 02:51:03.087]  And if you look at your history books, you'll see that was the known world.
[02:51:03.087 --> 02:51:05.130]  The Roman Empire was the known world.
[02:51:05.130 --> 02:51:10.358]  And it collapsed, not just because of their currency, which was a major part of it, but they couldn't defend their borders.
[02:51:11.073 --> 02:51:17.416]  And we're noticing now, are we not, in Europe, that they cannot defend the borders.
[02:51:17.416 --> 02:51:25.399]  The borders are being invaded by an alien culture, and that is the kind of thing that's going to actually drag everybody down with it.
[02:51:25.399 --> 02:51:28.900]  It's going to drag global government down.
[02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:31.001]  Sadly, it's going to drag the rest of us down with it.
[02:51:31.001 --> 02:51:33.222]  But yes, you're absolutely right.
[02:51:33.222 --> 02:51:37.644]  We can't go on like this, and it must end in tears one way or the other.
[02:51:39.064 --> 02:51:41.545]  There's another caller, I think, and thank you for that, Carlos.
[02:51:41.545 --> 02:51:43.186]  Thank you for that very interesting point.
[02:51:43.186 --> 02:51:45.166]  I entirely agree with you.
[02:51:45.166 --> 02:51:47.947]  Salvador, I think there's another man waiting on the line.
[02:51:47.947 --> 02:51:54.489]  Salvador, would you like to go ahead with your question?
[02:51:54.489 --> 02:51:55.869]  Wesley?
[02:51:55.869 --> 02:51:57.790]  Next man on the list.
[02:51:57.790 --> 02:51:58.690]  Wesley, hi.
[02:51:58.690 --> 02:52:00.331]  Hi, Wesley.
[02:52:00.331 --> 02:52:00.911]  Hi.
[02:52:00.911 --> 02:52:03.792]  I was wondering, well, here in America we have
[02:52:04.386 --> 02:52:07.988]  We have the idea of freedom of speech and petitioning your government.
[02:52:07.988 --> 02:52:13.812]  In the UK, you seem to lack that, and I don't know what your people are supposed to do.
[02:52:13.812 --> 02:52:18.996]  When you can get arrested for speech, what are you supposed to do to wake everybody up?
[02:52:18.996 --> 02:52:23.538]  I feel for all of you because I feel like you're my brothers.
[02:52:23.538 --> 02:52:27.681]  Western civilization goes down where everybody's screwed.
[02:52:32.714 --> 02:52:38.522]  You're absolutely right, Wesley, you're absolutely right on this, and of course it's a question of how long the darkness will hold.
[02:52:38.522 --> 02:52:48.796]  There's a new Dark Age, which of course, behind the Iron Curtain, which of course was referred to by Winston Churchill behind the Iron Curtain, there's secret police, there's thought police,
[02:52:49.517 --> 02:52:53.501]  There's prison for anybody who thinks outside the box, as it were.
[02:52:53.501 --> 02:52:55.423]  And this is one of the great problems.
[02:52:55.423 --> 02:52:56.564]  We've got to go through that.
[02:52:56.564 --> 02:52:58.886]  It's going to get worse before it gets better.
[02:52:58.886 --> 02:53:01.870]  And then, of course, we saw the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
[02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:04.092]  I was in Berlin when it happened.
[02:53:04.092 --> 02:53:08.016]  And things started to bounce back from behind the Iron Curtain.
[02:53:08.016 --> 02:53:09.498]  But it's going to have to get worse.
[02:53:10.259 --> 02:53:16.471]  Because sooner or later we're going to have to take, all of us are going to have to take to the streets and actually throw these people out of office.
[02:53:16.471 --> 02:53:19.798]  The Fed, the Wall Street bankers, the CIA.
[02:53:22.102 --> 02:53:26.106]  President Kennedy warned us about the machinations of the CIA, you know.
[02:53:26.106 --> 02:53:30.690]  All of this has been, we have been warned about all of this, and we all need to wake up, all of us.
[02:53:30.690 --> 02:53:34.193]  And of course it is the other problem that we have, is red and blue.
[02:53:34.193 --> 02:53:36.155]  You can only vote red or blue in America.
[02:53:36.155 --> 02:53:37.236]  It's the same with Britain.
[02:53:37.236 --> 02:53:38.457]  We can only vote red or blue.
[02:53:38.457 --> 02:53:41.079]  And there's no difference between the two, generally speaking.
[02:53:41.079 --> 02:53:43.722]  You still get the same Muppets on both sides.
[02:53:44.422 --> 02:53:50.127]  I made a speech about this a little while ago, I think we've got time to go into it, on state theft.
[02:53:50.127 --> 02:53:53.550]  Taxes, broadly speaking, theft by the state.
[02:53:53.550 --> 02:54:00.516]  And I think people are ready because that speech got somewhere in the region of 30 million, 40 million worldwide hits.
[02:54:00.516 --> 02:54:02.918]  It's only about a minute and a half or something.
[02:54:02.918 --> 02:54:04.219]  I think perhaps we might go to that.
[02:54:04.219 --> 02:54:04.860]  Can we go to that?
[02:54:15.010 --> 02:54:25.050]  I'm minded actually to quote the great American philosopher Murray Rothbard here that the state, the state is an institution of theft writ large.
[02:54:26.351 --> 02:54:35.596]  Tax is just about a system where politicians and bureaucrats steal money from their citizens to squander in the most disgraceful manner.
[02:54:35.596 --> 02:54:37.877]  This place is no exception.
[02:54:37.877 --> 02:54:43.740]  Fascinatingly, and I really don't know how you manage to keep a straight face when you're talking about tax evasion,
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:48.801]  The whole commission and the commission bureaucracy avoid their taxes.
[02:54:48.801 --> 02:54:52.142]  You don't pay taxes like citizen pay taxes.
[02:54:52.142 --> 02:55:00.065]  You have all sorts of special deals, composite tax rates, high tax thresholds, non-contributive pension schemes.
[02:55:01.412 --> 02:55:06.734]  You are the biggest tax avoiders in Europe and here you sit pontificating.
[02:55:06.734 --> 02:55:10.415]  Well, the message is getting home to the people of the European Union.
[02:55:10.415 --> 02:55:15.517]  You're gonna find that Eurosceptics are coming back in June in ever greater numbers.
[02:55:15.517 --> 02:55:16.838]  In ever greater numbers.
[02:55:16.838 --> 02:55:27.802]  And I can tell you worse, as the people get your number, it won't be long before they storm this chamber and they hang you and they'll be right.
[02:55:27.802 --> 02:55:28.042]  Well,
[02:55:29.577 --> 02:55:31.419]  You heard it first from me.
[02:55:31.419 --> 02:55:34.761]  I think we all need to stand up and we all need to be heard, don't we?
[02:55:34.761 --> 02:55:36.523]  Right across the free world.
[02:55:36.523 --> 02:55:41.047]  And it's a shame that we seem to be moving backwards, but... I think we've got another caller, have we?
[02:55:41.047 --> 02:55:41.847]  From California?
[02:55:41.847 --> 02:55:45.370]  Hi.
[02:55:45.370 --> 02:55:49.234]  Jim?
[02:55:49.234 --> 02:55:51.235]  Yeah, I'm here.
[02:55:51.235 --> 02:55:52.076]  Jim in California?
[02:55:52.076 --> 02:55:54.958]  Yeah, I'm here.
[02:55:54.958 --> 02:55:57.641]  Can you hear me?
[02:55:57.641 --> 02:55:57.821]  Hello?
[02:55:58.956 --> 02:56:01.598]  Hello, Jim?
[02:56:01.598 --> 02:56:05.520]  Yeah, I wanted to talk... Yeah, can you hear me?
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:06.121]  Yeah, far away.
[02:56:06.121 --> 02:56:16.147]  I wanted to, um, talk about, kind of bring in some geopolitics that relates to what's going on now with, um, you know, Spygate, or whatever.
[02:56:16.147 --> 02:56:27.215]  But I think that, kind of what was happening, uh, was under Obama, the CIA was kind of running wild, you know, as you know, with Hillary, and they were arming rebel groups, and
[02:56:28.577 --> 02:56:54.436]  Libya, Brennan was going to Ukraine and interfering with their political system and then again in Libya and you know there's a lot of financial maybe topics to deal with Lithuania and their gold and what happened there with France and everyone kind of leading the motive to go in there and mess it up basically but these guys were just running wild
[02:56:55.140 --> 02:56:58.843]  In the CIA under Obama, and I don't think you know what's happening.
[02:56:58.843 --> 02:57:00.344]  You're right.
[02:57:00.344 --> 02:57:01.725]  You're quite right.
[02:57:01.725 --> 02:57:02.246]  You're quite right.
[02:57:02.246 --> 02:57:04.788]  We're running out of time, I'm afraid, but you're absolutely right.
[02:57:04.788 --> 02:57:19.239]  The CIA has gone rogue, and in fact Kennedy actually said, President Kennedy, he said that if there was one thing he could have actually achieved in his term of office, so sadly cut short, and that's he would have got rid of the CIA.
[02:57:19.239 --> 02:57:22.442]  The CIA is a complete menace, and it's gone rogue.
[02:57:23.103 --> 02:57:25.286]  As most secret societies always do.
[02:57:25.286 --> 02:57:31.875]  And the CIA is simply a secret society with almost unlimited funds.
[02:57:31.875 --> 02:57:34.599]  But yeah, we're going to see how these things develop.
[02:57:34.599 --> 02:57:37.644]  But we've got a finger on the button at the Alex Jones Show, that's for sure.
[02:57:45.194 --> 02:57:48.776]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.776 --> 02:57:50.557]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.557 --> 02:58:01.823]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.703 --> 02:58:11.791]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.791 --> 02:58:17.755]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:58:17.755 --> 02:58:22.859]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.859 --> 02:58:25.482]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.482 --> 02:58:27.203]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.203 --> 02:58:32.007]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[02:58:32.227 --> 02:58:37.176]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.176 --> 02:58:39.820]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.820 --> 02:58:44.548]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[02:59:49.784 --> 03:00:02.293]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.293 --> 03:00:10.079]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.079 --> 03:00:13.982]  Some of them want to use you.
[03:00:13.982 --> 03:00:18.165]  Some of them want to get used by you.
[03:00:20.569 --> 03:00:29.135]  In Russia they call this the Solovki, the national security leadership that secretly spies on the entire citizenry of Russia.
[03:00:29.135 --> 03:00:34.418]  And here we are in the United States with our own Solovki underneath President Obama.
[03:00:34.418 --> 03:00:36.300]  Let me tell you something that I know for a fact.
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:47.027]  This informant, this person that they planned and tried to plan into the campaign and even into the administration, if you believe Axios, he's not the only person that came at the campaign.
[03:00:47.027 --> 03:00:51.110]  And the FBI is not the only Obama agency that came at the campaign.
[03:00:51.110 --> 03:00:52.791]  I know because they came at me.
[03:00:52.791 --> 03:00:56.753]  And I'm looking for clearance from my attorney to reveal this to the public.
[03:00:56.753 --> 03:00:58.434]  This is just the beginning.
[03:00:58.434 --> 03:01:06.800]  And I'll tell you, when we finally find out the truth about this, Director Clapper and the rest of them are going to be wearing some orange suits.
[03:01:07.340 --> 03:01:10.341]  You just heard Michael Caputo break that down.
[03:01:10.341 --> 03:01:13.943]  I was thinking about this this morning.
[03:01:13.943 --> 03:01:15.544]  And it gave me a headache.
[03:01:15.544 --> 03:01:28.409]  Because there are so many known FBI, Democratic Party, George Soros Foundation, Defense Intelligence, CIA, globalist operatives.
[03:01:30.894 --> 03:01:38.956]  Who were openly surveilling Trump when he was a candidate, when he was the nominee, when he was president-elect, and even once he was president.
[03:01:38.956 --> 03:01:42.076]  First, oh, we're never spying on you.
[03:01:42.076 --> 03:01:45.297]  We're monitoring your digital transmissions, not wiretapping.
[03:01:45.297 --> 03:01:46.957]  That's an old term.
[03:01:46.957 --> 03:01:48.457]  So technically we're not wiretapping.
[03:01:48.457 --> 03:01:51.158]  We're just intercepting everything you do illegally.
[03:01:51.158 --> 03:01:55.059]  Oh, we always said we didn't have moles inside the campaign.
[03:01:55.059 --> 03:01:57.339]  We had informants for your own safety.
[03:01:58.686 --> 03:02:10.950]  Run by Hillary Clinton, and run by Strzok, and run by McCabe, and run by Mueller, and all the rest of these people, who've all testified before Congress, there was no surveillance, and now they've been caught lying.
[03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:14.411]  This is so sensational.
[03:02:14.411 --> 03:02:24.975]  And it's been reported that this dossier was all dressed up by the FBI, taken to the FISA court, and presented as a legitimate intelligence document
[03:02:26.380 --> 03:02:30.664]  That it became the basis for granting a warrant to spy on Americans.
[03:02:30.664 --> 03:02:39.652]  Congressman, our staffs have been having extensive interaction with both intelligence committees on our interaction with the FISA court, and I think that's the appropriate setting for those questions.
[03:02:39.652 --> 03:02:41.794]  Here's what I think, Director Wray.
[03:02:41.794 --> 03:02:47.499]  I think Peter Strzok, head of counterintelligence at the FBI, Peter Strzok
[03:02:48.615 --> 03:02:52.257]  The guy who ran the Clinton investigation, did all the interviews.
[03:02:52.257 --> 03:02:57.061]  Peter Strzok, the guy who was running the Russian investigation at the FBI.
[03:02:57.061 --> 03:03:00.943]  Peter Strzok, Mr. Super Agent at the FBI.
[03:03:00.943 --> 03:03:05.266]  I think he's the guy who took the application to the FISA court.
[03:03:05.266 --> 03:03:13.212]  And if that happened, I mean, if this happened, if you had the FBI working with a campaign, the Democrats campaign,
[03:03:14.966 --> 03:03:22.848]  Taking opposition research, dressing it all up and turning it into an intelligence document and taking it to the FISA court so they can spy on the other campaign?
[03:03:22.848 --> 03:03:26.209]  If that happened, that is as wrong as it gets.
[03:03:26.209 --> 03:03:32.851]  It's so incredible that we are at this point and the media is desperately trying to cover it up.
[03:03:32.851 --> 03:03:41.713]  Desperately trying to not give it any coverage because they've all told you on late night comedy and on all the fake dinosaur media and all the fake news.
[03:03:42.651 --> 03:03:50.323]  That there is no spying on the campaign because it dwarfs Watergate by magnitudes.
[03:03:50.725 --> 03:03:53.207]  All right, let's just call it Crossfire Hurricane.
[03:03:53.207 --> 03:03:54.768]  Great, classic Stones.
[03:03:54.768 --> 03:03:56.570]  Mick Jagger, you're a bad boy.
[03:03:56.570 --> 03:03:59.192]  You know, Keith was the driving force behind that band, right?
[03:03:59.192 --> 03:04:01.173]  What, we're just discounting Brian Jones here?
[03:04:01.173 --> 03:04:02.514]  Come on, the guy could play the zither.
[03:04:02.514 --> 03:04:15.585]  You know, the focus here, as it was with the intelligence community, is not on the campaign per se, but what the Russians were doing to try to instantiate themselves in the campaign or to influence or leverage it.
[03:04:15.585 --> 03:04:19.068]  So if there was someone that was observing that sort of thing,
[03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:21.610]  Uh, well that's a good thing.
[03:04:21.610 --> 03:04:32.798]  At the end of the day, the big, fat, rotting, stinking, bloated, demonic whale that is the New World Order is going down, down, down to David Jones' locker.
[03:04:54.921 --> 03:04:55.702]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:55.702 --> 03:05:05.848]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:05.848 --> 03:05:14.354]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:14.354 --> 03:05:23.160]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:25.241 --> 03:05:30.525]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:05:30.525 --> 03:05:33.447]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:33.447 --> 03:05:44.836]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:44.836 --> 03:05:47.498]  It is amazing!
[03:05:47.498 --> 03:05:52.482]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:06:00.282 --> 03:06:24.191]  Thank you again Alex Jones and InfoWars for allowing me to sit here and blather on about what's going on in the world.
[03:06:24.191 --> 03:06:25.532]  Oh my god.
[03:06:25.532 --> 03:06:28.353]  You try to keep your finger on the pulse and you realize
[03:06:29.609 --> 03:06:31.091]  This whole thing is flatlining.
[03:06:31.091 --> 03:06:38.037]  The pulse of society is in a ventricular tachycardia.
[03:06:38.037 --> 03:06:40.379]  It's a disaster!
[03:06:40.379 --> 03:06:50.688]  There are people that I don't think they have the ability to comprehend simple speech
[03:06:52.811 --> 03:06:55.753]  Simple, if they read something, they're reading comprehension.
[03:06:55.753 --> 03:06:57.735]  I remember that as a kid, reading comprehension.
[03:06:57.735 --> 03:07:02.019]  You had to read things really quickly and then take a test to see if you could comprehend.
[03:07:02.019 --> 03:07:11.426]  Because it doesn't matter how fast information is flying into your head, if you can't disseminate it and understand it, it's useless.
[03:07:11.426 --> 03:07:19.993]  But there seems to be people that just are mental patients.
[03:07:19.993 --> 03:07:22.115]  Some of this stuff is so obvious.
[03:07:22.115 --> 03:07:22.315]  Look,
[03:07:23.095 --> 03:07:24.496]  Perspective.
[03:07:24.496 --> 03:07:26.897]  Things have to be put into perspective.
[03:07:26.897 --> 03:07:28.557]  Let's take an example here.
[03:07:28.557 --> 03:07:34.060]  A lot of people call things conspiracy theories.
[03:07:34.060 --> 03:07:38.082]  They say, oh, that's outrageous to even believe something like that.
[03:07:38.082 --> 03:07:40.483]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[03:07:40.483 --> 03:07:49.607]  And a lot of these things that are labeled conspiracy theories, they can be tossed around and have various, you can have various opinions on them and whatnot, but
[03:07:51.414 --> 03:07:57.417]  In the end, there seems to be a logical explanation for certain things.
[03:07:57.417 --> 03:08:06.182]  They are lumping things into the category of conspiracy theories these days that have facts to back them up.
[03:08:06.182 --> 03:08:09.324]  There's no debating something.
[03:08:09.324 --> 03:08:16.968]  Right now, I am addressing the fact that the FBI had operatives in
[03:08:20.046 --> 03:08:25.488]  The Trump campaign during the last presidential election.
[03:08:25.488 --> 03:08:29.390]  There were operatives in there.
[03:08:29.390 --> 03:08:42.136]  And now what their mission was seems to be up for debate, but again, I think we could pretty much figure out what was going on.
[03:08:42.136 --> 03:08:47.318]  If the Obama administration was behind Hillary's
[03:08:49.654 --> 03:08:52.436]  attempt to be elected president, which they were.
[03:08:52.436 --> 03:08:57.841]  We know that Barack Obama wanted Hillary Clinton to be president.
[03:08:57.841 --> 03:08:59.983]  He campaigned for her.
[03:08:59.983 --> 03:09:16.056]  And his administration, his FBI, his Department of Justice, decides to put an operative, at least one, perhaps two or more, into the Trump campaign?
[03:09:16.056 --> 03:09:16.657]  And then, here,
[03:09:18.496 --> 03:09:22.038]  Which, by the way, is insane to even think of!
[03:09:22.038 --> 03:09:25.960]  This is so crazy!
[03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:40.327]  And believe me, if it had been the other way around, and you found out that President Bush had put people into Obama's campaign, it just would have been, there would have been firing squads.
[03:09:40.327 --> 03:09:41.707]  It would have been insane.
[03:09:41.707 --> 03:09:45.169]  But we're looking at this.
[03:09:45.169 --> 03:09:46.990]  Operatives were put into the campaign.
[03:09:48.032 --> 03:09:51.195]  And now here's the excuse that I'm hearing.
[03:09:51.195 --> 03:09:56.720]  Well, it was for his protection.
[03:09:56.720 --> 03:10:00.924]  Can anyone really grasp that?
[03:10:00.924 --> 03:10:03.627]  They're not even denying it at this point.
[03:10:03.627 --> 03:10:05.649]  They're not even denying it.
[03:10:05.649 --> 03:10:13.116]  They were spying on Trump's campaign to protect Trump from these evil Russians.
[03:10:14.289 --> 03:10:19.772]  The Russians are obviously trying to interfere with the election.
[03:10:19.772 --> 03:10:36.543]  The FBI and Obama and everybody else involved, they decide to put operatives in the Trump campaign to protect the Trump campaign and Donald Trump from being compromised by these horrible Russians.
[03:10:36.543 --> 03:10:40.846]  Oh, by the way, we didn't tell Donald Trump about it.
[03:10:40.846 --> 03:10:42.847]  We didn't tell him about it.
[03:10:46.457 --> 03:10:58.265]  Was the same amazing courtesy and thoughtfulness by Obama and the FBI given to Hillary Clinton?
[03:10:58.265 --> 03:11:01.288]  Was Hillary Clinton's campaign?
[03:11:01.288 --> 03:11:04.330]  Were spies put in there too to protect her?
[03:11:04.330 --> 03:11:09.794]  Because if I was Hillary, oh, would I be so mad that her own people
[03:11:10.515 --> 03:11:25.905]  The Democratic Party, her own people, wouldn't give her that amazing courtesy and protection that they gave Donald Trump by embedding spies in his campaign.
[03:11:25.905 --> 03:11:37.053]  If you think for a second that the Obama administration didn't put spies in Donald Trump's campaign to set him up
[03:11:37.907 --> 03:11:50.455]  For an accusation of Russian collusion, and to just keep an eye on what he was doing, and feed that information to the Hillary Clinton campaign, you're out of your mind.
[03:11:50.455 --> 03:11:51.696]  You're a mental patient.
[03:11:51.696 --> 03:11:53.757]  You're delusional.
[03:11:53.757 --> 03:11:59.001]  Or, you know that this is going on, and you're willing to accept it.
[03:11:59.791 --> 03:12:03.214]  I actually have more respect for that person.
[03:12:03.214 --> 03:12:06.176]  Because at least there's a thought process going on.
[03:12:06.176 --> 03:12:07.957]  At least you're thinking, well, you know what?
[03:12:07.957 --> 03:12:11.440]  I would have liked that Hillary to win.
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:15.823]  And if they had a spy in there, I would hope that would work out.
[03:12:15.823 --> 03:12:28.113]  The worst thing to think is that people are so stupid and so naive that they actually believe when they hear that the FBI put people in Trump's campaign
[03:12:28.849 --> 03:12:32.430]  To protect him and help him.
[03:12:32.430 --> 03:12:37.611]  I mean, honestly, it's embarrassing.
[03:12:37.611 --> 03:12:42.893]  Not to mention unbelievably corrupt and criminal.
[03:12:42.893 --> 03:12:52.615]  I cannot wait because they are having a closed door security meeting with members of the Republican Congress.
[03:12:53.929 --> 03:13:07.759]  And they're going over a lot of this information as to why, the whys, hows, and whos of these people being put into Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:13:07.759 --> 03:13:13.403]  And I can't wait to hear from some of these people that are in this meeting as to what happened.
[03:13:13.403 --> 03:13:14.144]  What happened?
[03:13:14.144 --> 03:13:14.644]  Why?
[03:13:14.644 --> 03:13:17.786]  And it all boils down to this.
[03:13:17.786 --> 03:13:20.688]  Again, this stuff is so obvious.
[03:13:20.688 --> 03:13:21.649]  Who's not seeing it?
[03:13:22.210 --> 03:13:24.831]  Or who's choosing not to see it?
[03:13:24.831 --> 03:13:30.633]  This all is coming to the surface because of one thing.
[03:13:30.633 --> 03:13:32.834]  Donald Trump winning the election.
[03:13:32.834 --> 03:13:38.196]  This was never, ever supposed to see the light of day.
[03:13:38.196 --> 03:13:44.598]  Hillary Clinton was a shoe-in, a lock, to win the presidency.
[03:13:44.598 --> 03:13:51.521]  This monkey wrench, Donald Trump, comes winging into the machine and screws up everything.
[03:13:52.541 --> 03:14:00.945]  And people are sitting there going, wait, we set him up to be in collusion with the Russians.
[03:14:00.945 --> 03:14:08.069]  We're the ones that put people in his campaign to have meetings, to make it look like he was doing this.
[03:14:08.069 --> 03:14:19.115]  And if push came to shove, we could then release some of this collusion stuff and hurt him and discredit him and make him look like he was working with the Russians.
[03:14:20.353 --> 03:14:24.136]  And Hillary was supposed to win, and this was never supposed to see the light of day.
[03:14:24.136 --> 03:14:25.417]  Oops!
[03:14:25.417 --> 03:14:33.402]  Then the American people spoke, Donald Trump wins, and now they are losing their minds.
[03:14:33.402 --> 03:14:37.385]  Did you see when this really started coming around?
[03:14:37.385 --> 03:14:39.226]  We've been hearing about this for a long time.
[03:14:39.226 --> 03:14:40.867]  No one's acknowledged it, though.
[03:14:40.867 --> 03:14:45.991]  But real proof of this has come out very recently.
[03:14:46.671 --> 03:14:49.012]  And have you noticed the change in tone?
[03:14:49.012 --> 03:14:52.493]  And even the people that are commenting that weren't saying a word.
[03:14:52.493 --> 03:14:57.454]  Donald Trump was tweeting about the Mueller investigation.
[03:14:57.454 --> 03:14:59.495]  He's been very vocal about things.
[03:14:59.495 --> 03:15:03.916]  But you never heard from a lot of the players involved now.
[03:15:03.916 --> 03:15:09.857]  And all of a sudden they're coming out of the woodwork and starting to comment on this.
[03:15:09.857 --> 03:15:11.158]  Circle the wagons.
[03:15:11.158 --> 03:15:13.118]  They're scared.
[03:15:13.118 --> 03:15:15.639]  Because this is not going to go away.
[03:15:16.822 --> 03:15:22.636]  And a political cover-up is something that rarely stays covered up.
[03:15:23.772 --> 03:15:25.793]  You want to talk about Watergate and Nixon?
[03:15:25.793 --> 03:15:28.574]  This is insanity.
[03:15:28.574 --> 03:15:29.194]  Oh, what's that?
[03:15:29.194 --> 03:15:29.974]  Music?
[03:15:29.974 --> 03:15:33.396]  Yeah, you want to talk about Nixon and Watergate?
[03:15:33.396 --> 03:15:35.957]  It's a lot worse than that.
[03:15:35.957 --> 03:15:37.397]  And it's the cover-up.
[03:15:37.397 --> 03:15:40.459]  And I believe this also goes right to the top.
[03:15:40.459 --> 03:15:46.681]  Barack Hussein Obama will be brought on the carpet for this one.
[03:15:46.681 --> 03:15:47.241]  Be right back.
[03:15:47.241 --> 03:15:47.881]  Don't go anywhere.

[03:20:13.243 --> 03:20:20.285]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.285 --> 03:20:28.606]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:20:28.606 --> 03:20:29.886]  Yes, welcome.
[03:20:29.886 --> 03:20:32.447]  Welcome and how you doing everybody?
[03:20:32.447 --> 03:20:38.408]  I want to talk about this Donald Trump canceling his summit with Kim Jong-un.
[03:20:39.899 --> 03:20:46.482]  Because his open hostility and tremendous anger after North Korea insults Mike Pence.
[03:20:46.482 --> 03:21:07.050]  Well, now of course you're going to get a lot of people on the left and the usual suspects, Pelosi, Chuckie Schumer, saying that this again, everything Trump does is terrible, it's an abomination to man and horrible for the country.
[03:21:08.311 --> 03:21:28.882]  This, of course, was supposed to be the great meeting in Singapore where Kim Jong-un was going to promise to dismantle his nuclear arsenal and we were going to have a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, perhaps even ending, having a true end to the Korean War.
[03:21:28.882 --> 03:21:35.386]  But Trump decided to cancel this after Kim Jong-un has been, of late, getting a little lippy.
[03:21:36.477 --> 03:21:38.079]  He's getting a little lippy lately.
[03:21:38.079 --> 03:21:42.643]  And I think he's forgetting who he's dealing with.
[03:21:42.643 --> 03:21:45.385]  This isn't Obama.
[03:21:45.385 --> 03:21:48.808]  This isn't George Bush, either one of them.
[03:21:48.808 --> 03:21:51.471]  This isn't Bill Clinton.
[03:21:51.471 --> 03:21:59.118]  This isn't any of the past presidents who have appeased this regime for decades upon decades.
[03:21:59.118 --> 03:22:00.659]  Where the look
[03:22:01.548 --> 03:22:10.930]  And the perception that you were making headway with North Korea was actually better than really doing something.
[03:22:10.930 --> 03:22:12.870]  Because that's what got votes.
[03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:21.252]  That's what got you the ability to go out there and lie about your achievements you have made with North Korea.
[03:22:21.252 --> 03:22:29.473]  This proves, again, that Donald Trump isn't one to just make a deal because it looks good for him.
[03:22:30.399 --> 03:22:33.761]  He wants to make deals that are good for this country.
[03:22:33.761 --> 03:22:47.449]  Let's take a look at the Iranian deal with the wonderful Barack Obama and his cuckold Secretary of State Kerry.
[03:22:47.449 --> 03:22:54.473]  We saw a horrible deal made just so they were able to say, we made a deal.
[03:22:54.473 --> 03:22:55.893]  That's politics.
[03:22:55.893 --> 03:22:58.555]  Those are politicians, not Donald Trump.
[03:22:59.105 --> 03:23:06.409]  Politicians will make a deal and then say, well, we made a deal with Iran.
[03:23:06.409 --> 03:23:09.771]  They won't have a nuclear arsenal.
[03:23:09.771 --> 03:23:10.632]  It's going to be great.
[03:23:10.632 --> 03:23:13.374]  And we pat ourselves on the back for it.
[03:23:13.374 --> 03:23:15.915]  And meanwhile, it's not a good deal.
[03:23:15.915 --> 03:23:16.876]  It's terrible.
[03:23:16.876 --> 03:23:27.542]  But they're running for office because that's all they ever want to do is do things or make a perception that they're doing things that will then get them votes.
[03:23:28.855 --> 03:23:43.026]  So Donald Trump says he's gonna sit down and talk with Kim Jong-un about the nuclear problem in the peninsula and perhaps ending the war and getting North Korea up to speed with this century.
[03:23:44.322 --> 03:23:46.364]  His people over there are starving.
[03:23:46.364 --> 03:23:49.407]  They don't have proper medical attention.
[03:23:49.407 --> 03:23:54.091]  It's just a disaster over there and here's a chance to actually get in.
[03:23:54.091 --> 03:23:58.754]  He's got an opening here to get in with the rest of the world.
[03:23:58.754 --> 03:24:08.202]  Perhaps trade with the rest of the world and become economically viable and actually support your people.
[03:24:08.202 --> 03:24:12.286]  But he started mouthing off about Pence and
[03:24:13.401 --> 03:24:24.365]  Lately, he's kind of making it seem like he doesn't want us to hold any military exercises with South Korea, which we've been doing, obviously, for decades.
[03:24:24.365 --> 03:24:27.006]  So Donald Trump decides, you know what?
[03:24:27.006 --> 03:24:27.586]  No.
[03:24:27.586 --> 03:24:28.447]  It's off.
[03:24:28.447 --> 03:24:30.187]  Not doing it.
[03:24:30.187 --> 03:24:37.110]  Which now leaves the ball firmly in North Korea's court as to what they do next.
[03:24:37.110 --> 03:24:42.212]  Does Kim Jong Un think that, hey, wow, I kind of blew my shot at maybe
[03:24:43.027 --> 03:24:46.708]  Maybe having a little bit of interaction with the rest of the globe?
[03:24:46.708 --> 03:24:54.070]  And does he come back to the table now and say, I'm sorry?
[03:24:54.070 --> 03:24:58.491]  Or just something to get back in the good graces of Donald Trump.
[03:24:58.491 --> 03:25:00.371]  But Donald Trump gets criticized for this.
[03:25:00.371 --> 03:25:06.653]  He's a president that's actually willing to change his tactics.
[03:25:06.653 --> 03:25:11.594]  To look at something and go, well, that was okay yesterday, but because of
[03:25:12.875 --> 03:25:16.096]  The events of today, now it's not good.
[03:25:16.096 --> 03:25:17.716]  So we're going to change that.
[03:25:17.716 --> 03:25:33.679]  Instead of a politician, which God forbid you change your take on something, even if something happens, that means you should change your tactics on it, but they will just forge ahead like they did with that Iranian deal.
[03:25:33.679 --> 03:25:37.300]  They will forge ahead just so they could say they made a deal.
[03:25:37.300 --> 03:25:42.001]  So I respect what Donald Trump did in this instance.
[03:25:42.810 --> 03:25:45.972]  Because you don't want to seem weak.
[03:25:45.972 --> 03:25:53.595]  And what the Liberals and Democrats, Progressives, whatever, what they don't seem to understand, what they just can't grasp.
[03:25:53.595 --> 03:25:56.517]  He's done this so many times.
[03:25:56.517 --> 03:26:04.521]  His actions that he takes to get something done are never this one event thing.
[03:26:04.521 --> 03:26:06.361]  It's not like, oh, I want to do this.
[03:26:06.361 --> 03:26:07.342]  Bam, there it is.
[03:26:08.257 --> 03:26:10.978]  He does things in steps.
[03:26:10.978 --> 03:26:20.122]  It's an amazing bargaining tactic that he uses and has used his whole life, if you've read Art of the Deal.
[03:26:20.122 --> 03:26:27.005]  So let's say he's got five steps to get to his final goal of what he wants done.
[03:26:27.005 --> 03:26:31.527]  By the first step, they're already trouncing on him about what he's doing.
[03:26:32.199 --> 03:26:32.559]  What?
[03:26:32.559 --> 03:26:33.880]  Did you hear what he said?
[03:26:33.880 --> 03:26:35.761]  Did you hear what he wrote?
[03:26:35.761 --> 03:26:37.181]  Did you read what he wrote?
[03:26:37.181 --> 03:26:38.302]  Did you see what he did?
[03:26:38.302 --> 03:26:40.663]  Like, it's terrible!
[03:26:40.663 --> 03:26:49.927]  Not realizing that that's the first of four other things that he's got lined up to get to that final end goal on something.
[03:26:49.927 --> 03:26:52.629]  They just don't see... And he does it time and time again.
[03:26:52.629 --> 03:26:57.271]  And they just want to crap all over everything
[03:26:58.030 --> 03:26:59.010]  He does.
[03:26:59.010 --> 03:27:00.891]  He's a negotiator.
[03:27:00.891 --> 03:27:02.412]  He's a businessman.
[03:27:02.412 --> 03:27:05.193]  He was never a politician.
[03:27:05.193 --> 03:27:15.796]  So what you're seeing is somebody that is the President of the United States working the office like a business and like a businessman would.
[03:27:15.796 --> 03:27:16.977]  And what are we seeing?
[03:27:16.977 --> 03:27:19.057]  Results.
[03:27:19.057 --> 03:27:22.318]  By the way, you gotta search for those results because you won't see it on mainstream media.
[03:27:22.318 --> 03:27:23.499]  CNN, MSNBC.
[03:27:23.499 --> 03:27:25.199]  They will not show the results.
[03:27:25.199 --> 03:27:26.520]  The lowest unemployment
[03:27:27.545 --> 03:27:33.426]  Overall, the lowest unemployment out of the April numbers came out since 2000.
[03:27:33.426 --> 03:27:37.027]  Minority unemployment, all-time lows.
[03:27:37.027 --> 03:27:38.987]  ISIS decimated.
[03:27:38.987 --> 03:27:41.327]  Working on North Korea.
[03:27:41.327 --> 03:27:42.708]  MS-13.
[03:27:42.708 --> 03:27:45.008]  Border security.
[03:27:45.008 --> 03:27:47.788]  Law enforcement support.
[03:27:47.788 --> 03:27:49.369]  The military.
[03:27:49.369 --> 03:27:52.849]  Building back up our military to a respectable level.
[03:27:52.849 --> 03:27:54.170]  Veteran care.
[03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:56.850]  Like, all of these things are the good things.
[03:27:57.839 --> 03:28:03.582]  And whenever I'm asked on Twitter to bring these things up, they're ignored.
[03:28:03.582 --> 03:28:05.863]  And all I get is emo.
[03:28:05.863 --> 03:28:06.643]  I get emotion.
[03:28:06.643 --> 03:28:08.364]  I get feels from people.
[03:28:08.364 --> 03:28:10.845]  Well, he said this.
[03:28:10.845 --> 03:28:12.546]  Oh, he meant that.
[03:28:12.546 --> 03:28:14.706]  It was very insulting.
[03:28:14.706 --> 03:28:16.087]  I don't care.
[03:28:16.087 --> 03:28:18.088]  Trump is like an old school president.
[03:28:18.088 --> 03:28:19.509]  Like Teddy Roosevelt.
[03:28:19.509 --> 03:28:20.309]  One of those guys that'll just
[03:28:21.022 --> 03:28:22.304]  Shoot from the hip!
[03:28:22.304 --> 03:28:33.379]  And it's refreshing that every word out of his mouth is some honed and calculated sentence so that the polls will be affected properly.
[03:28:33.379 --> 03:28:34.961]  It's embarrassing that...
[03:28:36.082 --> 03:28:40.504]  You still see politicians in the light of what Trump has done.
[03:28:40.504 --> 03:28:48.807]  Because boy, they're going to have a hard time convincing us in that political person's speech after we've seen somebody actually speaking to us like a human being.
[03:28:48.807 --> 03:28:49.407]  Be right back.
[03:28:49.407 --> 03:28:50.027]  Don't go anywhere.

[03:34:33.884 --> 03:34:34.365]  We're back.
[03:34:34.365 --> 03:34:35.725]  Anthony Comey in at InfoWars.com.
[03:34:37.597 --> 03:34:44.822]  Boy, you know, if you've watched me on this very program, you know how much I love Hollywood!
[03:34:44.822 --> 03:34:46.843]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
[03:34:46.843 --> 03:34:48.664]  Hollywood!
[03:34:48.664 --> 03:34:49.264]  Lunatics!
[03:34:49.264 --> 03:34:50.045]  Mental patients!
[03:34:50.689 --> 03:34:59.476]  They are losing their minds, and on a daily basis, when I see what's going on out there in Hollywood, I laugh my ass off.
[03:34:59.476 --> 03:35:03.800]  It's hilarious to watch them.
[03:35:03.800 --> 03:35:07.202]  I've used lose their minds a lot during my life.
[03:35:07.202 --> 03:35:12.146]  It's always been a funny thing to say, like, ah, a person's losing their mind.
[03:35:12.146 --> 03:35:13.888]  Oh, my God.
[03:35:13.888 --> 03:35:14.728]  Oh, my dad.
[03:35:14.728 --> 03:35:15.129]  Oh, my God.
[03:35:15.129 --> 03:35:16.690]  He got so mad, I took the car out.
[03:35:16.690 --> 03:35:18.051]  He was losing his mind.
[03:35:18.051 --> 03:35:20.193]  And we use it as kind of an exaggerated thing.
[03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:29.117]  Quite literally, they are losing their minds, and I couldn't be happier.
[03:35:29.117 --> 03:35:37.344]  I get into Twitter, little Twitter arguments with some of the best, oh boy, the best of Hollywood.
[03:35:37.344 --> 03:35:38.725]  There's a Cher.
[03:35:38.725 --> 03:35:47.053]  Last night I had a little exchange with the wonderful Cher about Donald Trump and politics and whatnot.
[03:35:47.053 --> 03:35:47.653]  And then there's
[03:35:48.823 --> 03:35:51.665]  Then there's Robert De Niro.
[03:35:51.665 --> 03:36:00.811]  Robert De Niro is now, he's lost his mind so much that he is saying he's banning Donald Trump from his restaurants.
[03:36:00.811 --> 03:36:09.236]  No longer will Donald Trump be able to walk in, take a seat at one of Robert De Niro's restaurants, sit down and have a meal.
[03:36:09.236 --> 03:36:17.421]  Do you think Donald Trump would want to sit in one of his restaurants and support this
[03:36:19.247 --> 03:36:20.808]  Idiot.
[03:36:20.808 --> 03:36:22.149]  What a shame.
[03:36:22.149 --> 03:36:27.694]  What an amazing career Robert De Niro has had.
[03:36:27.694 --> 03:36:34.339]  And now it's just been tainted by, first of all, by just horrible movies.
[03:36:34.339 --> 03:36:39.082]  This is the guy we watched in The Godfather Part 2.
[03:36:39.082 --> 03:36:46.128]  And of course, Goodfellas and Casino, Raging Bull.
[03:36:47.314 --> 03:37:01.646]  These just amazing Taxi Driver, amazing films, iconic American classics, and now he's a doddering fool.
[03:37:01.646 --> 03:37:06.990]  Look, look, just an amazing movie, Taxi Driver.
[03:37:06.990 --> 03:37:11.334]  And then you realize, oh, he's an idiot.
[03:37:11.334 --> 03:37:12.595]  Oh, he's mentally ill.
[03:37:14.194 --> 03:37:17.996]  And that's what we're seeing from the Hollywood left.
[03:37:17.996 --> 03:37:21.919]  So he's saying Trump is no longer allowed in Nobu.
[03:37:21.919 --> 03:37:24.061]  You think that bothers Donald Trump?
[03:37:24.061 --> 03:37:30.906]  Do you think Donald Trump is like, oh boy, I was just going to take Melania there tomorrow night.
[03:37:30.906 --> 03:37:33.028]  I've got to make new reservations.
[03:37:33.028 --> 03:37:34.489]  He doesn't care!
[03:37:34.489 --> 03:37:36.490]  He doesn't care!
[03:37:36.490 --> 03:37:38.832]  And these are the guys like, he's like,
[03:37:41.400 --> 03:37:43.561]  I'll punch him in the face.
[03:37:43.561 --> 03:37:45.781]  He's a mutt.
[03:37:45.781 --> 03:38:02.045]  And the first ones to want to inflict some type of physical violence upon Donald Trump or anyone that supports him are the progressive, inclusive, tolerant, liberal left.
[03:38:02.045 --> 03:38:08.187]  We just saw Tommy Lernon get water thrown on her at a restaurant the other day.
[03:38:09.062 --> 03:38:12.383]  Just based on nothing but her political ideology.
[03:38:12.383 --> 03:38:18.464]  Her right as an American to have an opinion on politics here in this country.
[03:38:18.464 --> 03:38:23.565]  And exercise her freedom of speech in this country.
[03:38:23.565 --> 03:38:25.025]  And what is it met with?
[03:38:25.025 --> 03:38:28.585]  By the tolerant left?
[03:38:28.585 --> 03:38:35.847]  Yelling and water being thrown at her in a public restaurant.
[03:38:35.847 --> 03:38:37.507]  That is the tolerant
[03:38:38.647 --> 03:38:42.849]  tolerant, liberal, progressive left.
[03:38:42.849 --> 03:38:49.552]  The same ones that don't allow any conservative speech on their college campuses.
[03:38:49.552 --> 03:38:55.175]  The same left that embraces revisionist history.
[03:38:55.175 --> 03:38:56.935]  That's what we're talking about.
[03:38:56.935 --> 03:39:03.098]  And it all comes down to the fact that they're losing their minds.
[03:39:03.098 --> 03:39:06.580]  One of my favorites, one of my favorites of all time,
[03:39:07.308 --> 03:39:10.329]  Is Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:39:10.329 --> 03:39:16.131]  Rosie O'Donnell is out of her mind.
[03:39:16.131 --> 03:39:30.115]  The second Donald Trump called her a fat pig on national television during one of the most viewed debates in American history.
[03:39:30.115 --> 03:39:32.336]  I think that might have gotten to her.
[03:39:32.336 --> 03:39:34.957]  And since then, she has lost her mind.
[03:39:36.014 --> 03:39:40.715]  Um, so... There she is!
[03:39:40.715 --> 03:39:42.295]  Was that a glamour shot?
[03:39:42.295 --> 03:39:46.256]  I've never seen her look better.
[03:39:46.256 --> 03:39:50.256]  So every day on Twitter, I've been through three Twitter accounts now.
[03:39:50.256 --> 03:39:55.577]  I'm on my third Twitter account because I keep getting suspended for just speaking openly and honestly.
[03:39:55.577 --> 03:39:57.638]  I don't use racial epithets.
[03:39:57.638 --> 03:40:02.238]  I don't use epithets against the gay community.
[03:40:02.238 --> 03:40:03.159]  None of that.
[03:40:03.159 --> 03:40:03.779]  None of that.
[03:40:03.779 --> 03:40:05.119]  I get kicked off
[03:40:05.740 --> 03:40:09.081]  Because I'm voicing my political opinion.
[03:40:09.081 --> 03:40:13.283]  And some people don't like it, and I get kicked off, and I have to make a new account.
[03:40:13.283 --> 03:40:14.143]  And I've done that.
[03:40:14.143 --> 03:40:15.783]  This is my third account.
[03:40:15.783 --> 03:40:17.404]  So, it's never good.
[03:40:17.404 --> 03:40:20.905]  You gotta rebuild followers and whatnot, and it's a big pain.
[03:40:20.905 --> 03:40:29.228]  But, the one good thing, every time I get blocked by Rosie, with one of those accounts, and I have to get a new account, I get to see Rosie's Twitter feed.
[03:40:29.998 --> 03:40:37.223]  And it is a joy to watch her slowly lose her mind.
[03:40:37.223 --> 03:40:52.492]  You know what she's doing now in between tweeting bizarrely inaccurate things about Donald Trump and the idea, the delusion she has of him in an orange jumpsuit behind bars?
[03:40:52.492 --> 03:40:55.854]  She really thinks Donald Trump's going to prison.
[03:40:55.854 --> 03:40:57.795]  It's completely insane.
[03:40:57.795 --> 03:40:58.796]  But she believes it.
[03:40:59.415 --> 03:41:06.556]  And in between these wandering, rambling Twitter posts, she paints.
[03:41:06.556 --> 03:41:11.277]  She paints pictures of Donald Trump.
[03:41:11.277 --> 03:41:13.017]  They're terribly done.
[03:41:13.017 --> 03:41:20.279]  They honestly look like a third-grader's art project.
[03:41:20.279 --> 03:41:28.380]  And she talks about how he's not her president, and he stole the election, and he's a criminal.
[03:41:29.675 --> 03:41:34.841]  All of her wonderful paintings, look at this illegitimate, look at this painting!
[03:41:34.841 --> 03:41:42.668]  And then you realize, I was looking at some of these today and I go, oh, this is what they do in mental institutions!
[03:41:42.668 --> 03:41:49.896]  They sit the people down, they drug them out of their minds, and then they paint!
[03:41:50.899 --> 03:41:53.220]  So they could just remain calm.
[03:41:53.220 --> 03:41:54.641]  All right, Rosie.
[03:41:54.641 --> 03:41:58.103]  Why don't you paint another one of your daddy?
[03:41:58.103 --> 03:42:01.005]  Oh, I mean Donald Trump.
[03:42:01.005 --> 03:42:02.726]  Look, she's out of her mind.
[03:42:02.726 --> 03:42:04.407]  This is every day.
[03:42:04.407 --> 03:42:06.568]  This is her new life.
[03:42:06.568 --> 03:42:13.512]  Because it has been acknowledged by the entertainment community that she is entertainment kryptonite.
[03:42:13.512 --> 03:42:17.815]  She now just paints pictures like a mental patient in her home
[03:42:18.777 --> 03:42:23.479]  While watching her adopted kids run away from her.
[03:42:23.479 --> 03:42:30.422]  That's what she now, uh, that's what her insane life consists of.
[03:42:30.422 --> 03:42:31.563]  Um, you know.
[03:42:32.327 --> 03:42:34.108]  Take a hint from Bob Ross.
[03:42:34.108 --> 03:42:39.710]  That was a guy that knew how to chill, mellow out, and do some painting.
[03:42:39.710 --> 03:42:42.191]  Not rambling Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:42:42.191 --> 03:42:43.732]  And Jim Carrey's another one.
[03:42:43.732 --> 03:42:45.933]  Like mental patients, they sit there and paint.
[03:42:45.933 --> 03:42:47.714]  They paint about daddy.
[03:42:47.714 --> 03:42:48.914]  Donald Trump's their daddy.
[03:42:48.914 --> 03:42:50.955]  That's what it all boils down to.
[03:42:50.955 --> 03:42:52.135]  It's a daddy issue.
[03:42:52.135 --> 03:42:52.956]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:52.956 --> 03:42:53.616]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:53.616 --> 03:42:54.176]  Anthony Cumia.

[03:43:59.043 --> 03:43:59.924]  It'd take hours.
[03:43:59.924 --> 03:44:02.366]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:44:02.366 --> 03:44:03.547]  It's stronger.
[03:44:03.547 --> 03:44:05.148]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:44:05.148 --> 03:44:08.371]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:44:08.371 --> 03:44:09.492]  It's back in stock.
[03:44:09.492 --> 03:44:12.674]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:44:12.674 --> 03:44:15.997]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:44:16.397 --> 03:44:16.557]  I think?
[03:44:33.215 --> 03:44:34.416]  I don't know.
[03:44:54.096 --> 03:45:04.680]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.680 --> 03:45:06.760]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:45:06.760 --> 03:45:09.621]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.621 --> 03:45:11.102]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:11.102 --> 03:45:14.243]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:45:14.343 --> 03:45:17.926]  It's absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:45:17.926 --> 03:45:20.007]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:45:20.007 --> 03:45:29.715]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:45:29.715 --> 03:45:42.044]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[03:45:42.284 --> 03:45:46.528]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[03:45:57.913 --> 03:46:03.637]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:46:03.637 --> 03:46:11.522]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:46:11.522 --> 03:46:14.664]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:46:14.864 --> 03:46:20.128]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:46:20.128 --> 03:46:22.910]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:31.897]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:46:31.937 --> 03:46:38.179]  It's powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract.
[03:46:38.179 --> 03:46:43.900]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[03:46:43.900 --> 03:46:48.721]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:46:57.343 --> 03:47:00.004]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.653 --> 03:47:16.476]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:16.476 --> 03:47:19.758]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.758 --> 03:47:27.362]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:47:27.362 --> 03:47:32.065]  Hi everybody, Anthony Cumia, InfoWars.com.
[03:47:33.689 --> 03:47:41.051]  There's so much insanity and misinformation.
[03:47:41.051 --> 03:47:43.012]  It really looks like a mess out there.
[03:47:43.012 --> 03:47:46.513]  And we get to see it all on video.
[03:47:46.513 --> 03:47:56.335]  We get to see it right here on InfoWars, MyPlace, CompoundMedia.com, and YouTube, and LiveLeak, and all these places.
[03:47:56.335 --> 03:48:01.717]  You get to see videos of people with a complete lack of understanding
[03:48:02.438 --> 03:48:06.981]  of how to react during encounters with law enforcement.
[03:48:06.981 --> 03:48:12.926]  This is something that I can never get enough of watching because I'm amazed by it!
[03:48:12.926 --> 03:48:14.767]  I'm stunned!
[03:48:14.767 --> 03:48:25.935]  I have been around on this mortal coil for long enough to remember when I was a young man and would get pulled over by a police officer
[03:48:27.307 --> 03:48:30.528]  There was a way you acted, and that was it.
[03:48:30.528 --> 03:48:36.490]  And it didn't matter what color you were, how old you were, it didn't, nothing mattered.
[03:48:36.490 --> 03:48:46.874]  The lights came on behind you, and whatever, whatever your personality was, or whatever, you went into cop is-pulling-me-over mode.
[03:48:46.874 --> 03:48:51.796]  Ten and two, made sure the seatbelt was on, got all your stuff together.
[03:48:52.577 --> 03:48:53.217]  Pull over.
[03:48:53.217 --> 03:48:53.778]  Yes, sir.
[03:48:53.778 --> 03:48:54.618]  No, sir.
[03:48:54.618 --> 03:49:01.803]  You wanted to get through this experience as quickly as possible with as little damage as possible.
[03:49:01.803 --> 03:49:04.024]  By damage, I mean tickets.
[03:49:04.024 --> 03:49:05.545]  You know, that kind of damage.
[03:49:05.545 --> 03:49:14.530]  There was never, never an inkling of resisting what the cop was asking you.
[03:49:14.530 --> 03:49:16.371]  It just didn't happen.
[03:49:16.371 --> 03:49:22.035]  Well, nowadays, and I firmly blame, put most of the blame on the media.
[03:49:23.064 --> 03:49:26.446]  And our last president, Obama.
[03:49:26.446 --> 03:49:34.249]  Obama perpetuated this false narrative that the police are out there hunting young black men.
[03:49:34.249 --> 03:49:35.050]  Hunting them.
[03:49:35.050 --> 03:49:35.770]  That's what they do.
[03:49:35.770 --> 03:49:37.531]  They hunt them down.
[03:49:37.531 --> 03:49:40.032]  And that they're never going to get a fair shake.
[03:49:40.032 --> 03:49:49.477]  And that everyone that has a young black man, male child, has to have a talk with them about the police and how horrible they are.
[03:49:51.269 --> 03:50:04.860]  So I watch a lot of these videos, and what I see are people with a complete lack of understanding of what they should do during a traffic stop.
[03:50:04.860 --> 03:50:08.303]  Everyone becomes a car window attorney.
[03:50:08.303 --> 03:50:17.351]  Once that window goes down a little bit, you put your little plaque up that you're, you know, Tyrone Smith Esquire.
[03:50:18.380 --> 03:50:20.041]  And you're practicing law now.
[03:50:20.041 --> 03:50:25.222]  Now you're practicing law out of your Toyota Celica.
[03:50:25.222 --> 03:50:27.262]  I don't know where this comes from.
[03:50:27.262 --> 03:50:39.846]  And I have read things after you watch a video and you see people resisting lawful orders from the police, and they wind up turning something as simple as a taillight, a blinker, running a stop sign.
[03:50:39.846 --> 03:50:45.107]  They parlay that into a physical altercation and an arrest.
[03:50:45.971 --> 03:50:54.776]  Something that could be handled in minutes, very peacefully, and it gets turned into a disaster.
[03:50:54.776 --> 03:50:55.696]  And I watch why.
[03:50:55.696 --> 03:50:59.478]  I like watching and saying, what seems to be the problem here?
[03:50:59.478 --> 03:51:07.843]  Well, the problem is people have been misinformed as to what their rights are and aren't during a traffic stop.
[03:51:07.843 --> 03:51:10.024]  Lately, I've been noticing this one.
[03:51:10.024 --> 03:51:11.245]  People race home
[03:51:12.242 --> 03:51:13.483]  That seems to be it.
[03:51:13.483 --> 03:51:17.265]  There's this impression that it's a game.
[03:51:17.265 --> 03:51:23.068]  And if you get to home base, the cop isn't allowed to tag you anymore.
[03:51:23.068 --> 03:51:24.028]  It's done.
[03:51:24.028 --> 03:51:27.170]  So you'll get the police officer trying to pull someone out of the car.
[03:51:27.170 --> 03:51:29.511]  I saw a video recently with this one.
[03:51:29.511 --> 03:51:33.053]  Pulling a guy out of the car and he's like, no, I'm home.
[03:51:33.053 --> 03:51:33.954]  I'm home.
[03:51:33.954 --> 03:51:34.734]  I'm home.
[03:51:34.734 --> 03:51:37.756]  Thinking that means anything.
[03:51:37.756 --> 03:51:38.236]  It doesn't.
[03:51:38.926 --> 03:51:43.970]  A cop can absolutely pull you out of your car right there in your driveway.
[03:51:43.970 --> 03:52:00.784]  As a matter of fact, he doesn't want you running into your house because he doesn't know what you had on you that you might get rid of, what's in the house that you might pick up, or who else is in the house that might now outnumber him out there waiting in the driveway.
[03:52:00.784 --> 03:52:05.548]  So a police officer will give you a lawful order to stop
[03:52:06.221 --> 03:52:09.183]  Either stay in your car or get out of your car.
[03:52:09.183 --> 03:52:16.167]  And when he tries to put the handcuffs on you, he does not need to explain why you're being detained at that moment.
[03:52:16.167 --> 03:52:23.711]  Everyone also thinks that, this is an amazing thing I see, their friends must tell them this and they take it as gospel.
[03:52:23.711 --> 03:52:29.714]  That a police officer has to tell you why you're being arrested right there before they put the cuffs on.
[03:52:29.714 --> 03:52:31.575]  Before the cop puts the cuffs on.
[03:52:32.188 --> 03:52:41.113]  They think he has to tell you why you're being arrested, and if he doesn't, you have the right to resist arrest.
[03:52:41.113 --> 03:52:43.735]  Yeah, this clip was a great one.
[03:52:43.735 --> 03:52:55.281]  This guy got pulled over in front of his house by the cop for, I believe it was a taillight problem.
[03:52:55.281 --> 03:52:58.143]  He went to get out of the car.
[03:52:58.143 --> 03:53:01.265]  Since he's in the driveway, the cop ordered him to stay in the vehicle.
[03:53:02.159 --> 03:53:03.560]  He would not stay in the vehicle.
[03:53:03.560 --> 03:53:04.980]  He's yelling at him to get back in.
[03:53:04.980 --> 03:53:07.082]  This is before the video takes place.
[03:53:07.082 --> 03:53:13.285]  The cop then assesses the situation, looks, and then asks him to get out of the vehicle.
[03:53:13.285 --> 03:53:17.107]  And the comments I read were, Well, they're asking him to stay in, get out.
[03:53:17.107 --> 03:53:18.327]  What do they want him to do?
[03:53:18.327 --> 03:53:19.488]  You know what they want him to do?
[03:53:19.488 --> 03:53:22.509]  Whatever the hell he's asking at that moment.
[03:53:22.509 --> 03:53:27.032]  And when he's asking him to get out of the vehicle, that's when he should have gotten out of it.
[03:53:27.032 --> 03:53:31.614]  There's no winning resisting the cops when you're
[03:53:33.355 --> 03:53:35.177]  Being pulled over.
[03:53:35.177 --> 03:53:43.583]  And like I said, a lot of these simple stops, they're nothing, lead to physical altercations and arrests.
[03:53:43.583 --> 03:53:45.104]  Don't think you're a lawyer.
[03:53:45.104 --> 03:53:46.845]  Don't think you know your rights.
[03:53:46.845 --> 03:53:49.047]  Don't think once you get home you're safe.
[03:53:49.047 --> 03:53:50.628]  It doesn't work like that.
[03:53:50.628 --> 03:53:53.871]  And when the cop gives you a lawful order, you have to obey it.
[03:53:53.871 --> 03:53:57.654]  If he's going to arrest you, he doesn't have to tell you why he's arresting you at that moment.
[03:53:57.654 --> 03:54:00.716]  He doesn't have to read you your rights while he arrests you.
[03:54:01.673 --> 03:54:04.695]  If he's cuffing you, it doesn't necessarily mean you're under arrest.
[03:54:04.695 --> 03:54:06.215]  He could detain you at that time.
[03:54:06.215 --> 03:54:10.798]  These are all things they don't seem to have any concept of when you see these videos.
[03:54:10.798 --> 03:54:12.098]  It's crazy!
[03:54:12.098 --> 03:54:15.020]  I don't know where these people got this impression.
[03:54:15.020 --> 03:54:15.820]  I guess Twitter?
[03:54:15.820 --> 03:54:21.083]  I guess being emboldened by Barack Obama?
[03:54:21.083 --> 03:54:25.145]  Saying that the police are out there hunting young black men?
[03:54:25.145 --> 03:54:28.726]  What we've seen in Ferguson over the years and his
[03:54:30.589 --> 03:54:31.770]  His take on that?
[03:54:31.770 --> 03:54:36.454]  I mean, law enforcement, it's a tough job, man.
[03:54:36.454 --> 03:54:47.142]  And what we've also seen, another thing, thank God the liberals and the black community have begged, begged for police cameras, for body cams.
[03:54:47.142 --> 03:54:49.004]  Thank God this happened.
[03:54:49.600 --> 03:54:52.263]  Because I don't know what anyone was thinking.
[03:54:52.263 --> 03:54:59.711]  I thought they thought they were going to catch this amazing corruption of the police department and abuse going on and harassment.
[03:54:59.711 --> 03:55:02.735]  And what they're seeing is a lot of people are full of crap.
[03:55:03.747 --> 03:55:07.508]  About what has happened to them during the course of a traffic stop.
[03:55:07.508 --> 03:55:09.448]  We've had a couple of these stories.
[03:55:09.448 --> 03:55:11.669]  Despicable, slanderous, and false.
[03:55:11.669 --> 03:55:17.290]  Bodycam video reveals woman lied about being raped by a cop who pulled her over for Dewey.
[03:55:17.290 --> 03:55:21.931]  And even her lawyer now apologizes for any trouble these claims might have caused.
[03:55:21.931 --> 03:55:26.512]  This was an attempt to destroy a cop's life.
[03:55:26.512 --> 03:55:27.232]  Destroy it.
[03:55:27.927 --> 03:55:46.755]  And the only thing that saved him was an hour, almost two hour long body cam video that showed he did nothing but act professional during that stop and never tried to reach under her skirt, tell her that if she had sex with him that he would let her off the hook.
[03:55:46.755 --> 03:55:49.936]  All this stuff that she alleges is false.
[03:55:51.201 --> 03:55:52.983]  And we're seeing a lot of these.
[03:55:52.983 --> 03:56:04.038]  There was another one that a woman from a TV show, can't remember which one it is, she said that her son was racially profiled and harassed during a traffic stop.
[03:56:04.038 --> 03:56:05.460]  You couldn't have been nicer.
[03:56:05.460 --> 03:56:07.022]  The officer could not have been nicer.
[03:56:08.002 --> 03:56:15.426]  Spelt out what was going on, gave the man a citation, went back to his vehicle, traffic stop over.
[03:56:15.426 --> 03:56:21.268]  We're seeing a lot of these accusations coming about that are absolutely false.
[03:56:21.268 --> 03:56:32.014]  And this isn't something like, this happens and then you could start a GoFundMe, or you're a pastor in a church so you get a better, bigger following, which means more money.
[03:56:32.014 --> 03:56:34.615]  You're destroying a man's life.
[03:56:35.760 --> 03:56:39.381]  You are getting him death threats, by the way.
[03:56:39.381 --> 03:56:43.603]  I guess Talcum X, what's his name?
[03:56:43.603 --> 03:56:44.823]  Sean King.
[03:56:44.823 --> 03:56:45.363]  Sean King.
[03:56:45.363 --> 03:56:49.725]  We call him Talcum X. He's the white guy that says he's a black guy.
[03:56:49.725 --> 03:56:56.967]  He went on and put out the names of a police officer, put out the name of a police officer that did nothing wrong.
[03:56:56.967 --> 03:57:00.468]  It was this false rape allegation.
[03:57:00.468 --> 03:57:02.108]  And he put out the officer's name.
[03:57:02.108 --> 03:57:03.469]  He started getting death threats.
[03:57:04.548 --> 03:57:08.139]  And then it's proven false and it just goes away.
[03:57:08.139 --> 03:57:11.308]  Just nothing's done about it that they were trying to ruin a man.
[03:57:14.467 --> 03:57:16.768]  This needs to be criminal.
[03:57:16.768 --> 03:57:23.511]  People need to be held responsible for attempting to destroy people's lives with these false allegations.
[03:57:23.511 --> 03:57:26.792]  Thank God for police body cams.
[03:57:26.792 --> 03:57:28.113]  Thank God for them.
[03:57:28.113 --> 03:57:32.574]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for tuning in to InfoWars.com.
[03:57:32.574 --> 03:57:33.455]  I'm Anthony Cumia.

[03:57:43.240 --> 03:57:50.884]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[03:57:50.884 --> 03:57:58.787]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[03:57:58.787 --> 03:58:01.889]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[03:58:02.509 --> 03:58:07.154]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:58:07.154 --> 03:58:11.299]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[03:58:11.299 --> 03:58:14.442]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[03:58:14.442 --> 03:58:19.207]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[03:58:19.207 --> 03:58:22.291]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[03:58:22.651 --> 03:58:37.737]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[03:58:37.737 --> 03:58:39.277]  That is critical to this fight.
[03:58:39.277 --> 03:58:41.658]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
