[00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:11.556]  Big Brother.
[00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:14.179]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.801]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:19.244]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:21.186]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:28.413]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:41.665]  Welcome, my friends, to another global live transmission of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:42.725]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:49.168]  It is already the 17th day of May 2018 on this Thursday global broadcast.
[00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:53.570]  And then in four hours, The War Room with Owen Schroer and, of course, Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.611]  David Knight was on right before me with The Real News doing a great job.
[00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:00.733]  This only happens every once in a while.
[00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:06.956]  I looked at a bunch of the news this morning and it made my head start physically spinning.
[00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:10.898]  We've all heard that term that makes your head spin.
[00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.980]  I remember being like a kid and hearing grandpa just had a heart attack and might die and your head would kind of spin.
[00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:22.162]  And I'm looking at all this and it's just crazy.
[00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:25.963]  And the fact that the Republican leadership is so insulated.
[00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:33.798]  And doesn't even realize what's happening, and that's the good Republican leadership, not the blue bloods, is a big problem.
[00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:38.121]  We have to go take over public events, legally and lawfully.
[00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:39.862]  Like we said, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:43.665]  We have to take him over and say, web censorship is happening now!
[00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:51.250]  Conservative speech is being banned and suppressed now, because it's gone from restrictive to choking everywhere.
[00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:56.514]  We still have a voice, because we're on hundreds of radio stations and hundreds of TV stations.
[00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.732]  Google has totally delisted InfoWars and everybody else.
[00:02:02.253 --> 00:02:05.074]  Facebook is blocking engagement just the last month.
[00:02:05.494 --> 00:02:10.476]  They already cut it in half and so what was left of that 50% they just restricted that 80%.
[00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:23.020]  So we had 10 million likes on our on our Facebook pages that we built, that we promoted, that we gave value to Facebook and now they just come in and don't let anybody visit it.
[00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:31.689]  So a lot of conservatives are just rolling over and saying, we suddenly like liberals, so that they get promoted, but then no one likes them.
[00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.872]  So you take these middle-of-the-road fake conservatives like Ben Shapiro, you go to his website, almost every comment hates him.
[00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:48.314]  But he doesn't care because he's not going to be blocked because he's going to be a Benedict Arnold like Glenn Beck.
[00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:52.244]  Glenn Beck was told about this plan three and a half years ago.
[00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:56.128]  That's when he rolled on everybody and became this anti-Trump globalist.
[00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.090]  But that destroyed him anyways.
[00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:03.335]  He'd have been in better position sticking to what was right, but he sold out.
[00:03:04.332 --> 00:03:08.816]  And it's the same thing, but the draconian, mega-massive censorship is here.
[00:03:09.236 --> 00:03:13.759]  You've got to physically share NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.402]  You've got to physically share the articles and the videos, or they're not going to get out.
[00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:19.124]  And we're still chugging along.
[00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:24.488]  But the 2018 elections are here, and Trump's got a problem.
[00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:26.669]  In fact, that should be the name of this whole broadcast today.
[00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.611]  Trump's got a big problem.
[00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:34.349]  And when we come back, I'm gonna get into Trump's big problem and my message to the President.
[00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:41.636]  Because yeah, US satisfaction level highest since before the 2016 election for Trump.
[00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:46.700]  Leakers to the New York Times confirm FBI ran spy operation against Trump campaign.
[00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:48.642]  Where'd you hear about that first?
[00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:49.183]  Right here.
[00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:53.106]  That's why they hate us.
[00:03:54.628 --> 00:03:55.729]  Trump distance himself from
[00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.390]  White House saboteur Bolton.
[00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.430]  That's what it is.
[00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:02.992]  Libya's model plan for North Korea.
[00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:05.033]  Scales back military drill.
[00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:11.136]  Bolton's in there saying, we're gonna do what we did in Libya.
[00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:17.569]  We're going to follow that plan, which is a total, not even code word, to North Korea.
[00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.694]  That's what North Korea is worried about, is they give up the nukes, do what the West says, like Qaddafi did.
[00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:23.116]  He gave up just his WMDs.
[00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.277]  He'll be taken out.
[00:04:24.537 --> 00:04:26.099]  So why is Bolton in there doing it?
[00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:30.804]  Why did Trump think if he brought in a chief neocon, he would actually do what Trump wanted?
[00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:34.867]  These people have no respect for the country, whether they be left-wing or right-wing.
[00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:37.408]  These establishment people are a plague.
[00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:45.911]  Speaking of a plague, CNN, you know, has been caught taking billions of dollars over the years from foreign Gulf state dictators to put their Islamic agenda in America.
[00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:51.214]  And now they've got a disgusting report out we're going to cover where they tell everyone how to submit to Ramadan.
[00:04:51.614 --> 00:04:52.614]  It's disgusting.
[00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:56.536]  So it's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:56.936 --> 00:04:57.737]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:57.817 --> 00:04:58.897]  We are the tip of the spear.
[00:04:58.997 --> 00:05:00.378]  We are the resistance.
[00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:17.595]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose, and now freedom is back on the march.
[00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:25.384]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:25.704 --> 00:05:27.826]  No longer 5%, but now 10% at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:40.833]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:45.336]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
[00:05:45.716 --> 00:05:50.819]  And it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.881]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[00:05:54.122 --> 00:05:55.342]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:05:55.763 --> 00:06:03.488]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:21.343 --> 00:06:27.388]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:27.828 --> 00:06:29.309]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:35.313]  Well, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is going to be with us in studio for two hours.
[00:06:35.553 --> 00:06:39.014]  An amazing political mind, not just a spiritual brain.
[00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:47.018]  And he's grew up in South Africa, has seen the scourges of socialism and the scourges of globalism.
[00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:51.440]  He'll be breaking down from his expert perspective where the world is currently.
[00:06:52.352 --> 00:07:12.151]  He of course first warned in the middle of last year that he'd been told by members of Congress that there was an open plan to try to remove the president extrajudicially even outside of something like impeachment and the media said oh that's ridiculous that's not true and a few months later they then went on CNN
[00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:27.980]  The former head of the CIA and the former head of the Office of National Intelligence, Brennan, and of course, others, and said, oh, we're going to remove him by the end of the year, but not by impeachment.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.323]  So exactly what Pastor Brown said, of course, in part of the prayer meetings with the president at the White House and more.
[00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:35.724]  I've been watching him for years.
[00:07:36.204 --> 00:07:37.525]  When I can catch him on cable.
[00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:39.342]  And online.
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.701]  We're going to cover the waterfront with him coming up.
[00:07:52.842 --> 00:08:00.425]  And the reason Christians are under attack is we don't plug into their one world government, one world religion, stuff that this new Pope is pushing.
[00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:13.771]  And of course the word is now, even out of the major Italian papers, the Pope may resign at any time because his deputy head has been indicted and is in a secret trial in Australia for trafficking over a hundred little boys, reportedly.
[00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.911]  Talk about a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:22.913]  We're going to be looking at all of this coming up today.
[00:08:24.013 --> 00:08:25.574]  Now, Trump's got a big problem.
[00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:28.295]  He's been delivering on what he said he would do.
[00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:44.021]  He's overall been doing a great job, but he's just a man and he's surrounded by the swamp and he's having to governmentally pull from people in the governing class when three or four, five, six, seven levels deep, they are either neoconglobalist or leftist globalist.
[00:08:45.945 --> 00:09:02.043]  And we see example after example of this now, where Trump has openly come out against Bolton, his new national security advisor, because he keeps saying we need to go with the Libya model with North Korea, which is the clear signal
[00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:16.373]  We're going to overthrow and change your regime so the strategy of tension continues and so North Korea doesn't give up its nukes and then reunify with the South and become industrialized and come out of that nightmare system at least partially.
[00:09:16.693 --> 00:09:18.434]  In fact, here's a clip of Bolton.
[00:09:18.734 --> 00:09:21.176]  He's been running around continually parroting this.
[00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.993]  I think we're looking at the Libya model of 2003-2004.
[00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:30.401]  We're also looking at what North Korea itself has committed to previously.
[00:09:31.282 --> 00:09:35.808]  And most importantly I think going back over a quarter of a century to the 1992 joint North-South
[00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.690]  Thank you.
[00:10:04.352 --> 00:10:14.935]  And Trump is going to talk about that, but by saying the Libya model, days after they say, we don't want the Libya model, word for word, is beyond code word, saying, oh, you can't trust us.
[00:10:16.675 --> 00:10:17.436]  I elected Trump.
[00:10:17.476 --> 00:10:18.976]  I did not elect Mr. Bolton.
[00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:21.057]  But we will continue to look at that.
[00:10:21.257 --> 00:10:23.597]  But what's the big problem Trump's got?
[00:10:24.137 --> 00:10:25.738]  He's got people like Bolton, but then he's got
[00:10:27.569 --> 00:10:35.212]  Leakers, the New York Times now reports, have confirmed that the FBI ran spy operations against the Trump campaign.
[00:10:35.832 --> 00:10:42.515]  Gee, the New York Times on the 20th of January 2017 said that as its banner headline.
[00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:50.658]  We pointed that out even previously, so they went, oh, Trump gets it that he spied on from Alex Jones.
[00:10:52.598 --> 00:10:55.199]  And I'd love it if I had that much influence, but that's not the case.
[00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.700]  They just make that up.
[00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:03.659]  So again, this is beyond Watergate and the President's own words.
[00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.020]  But what's his real problem?
[00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:19.026]  His real problem is Zuckerberg, and Tim Cook at Apple, and Bezos at Amazon, and the folks over at Alphabet that runs Google.
[00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:25.292]  Their old logo was, their old maxim was, don't be evil.
[00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:26.952]  How about don't be Google?
[00:11:27.032 --> 00:11:29.553]  Google has broken their algorithm on purpose.
[00:11:29.973 --> 00:11:31.914]  It is now a worthless search engine.
[00:11:32.714 --> 00:11:34.274]  Bing is like the old Google.
[00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:36.475]  It actually works, even though that's Microsoft.
[00:11:36.755 --> 00:11:38.536]  And Microsoft isn't good.
[00:11:38.956 --> 00:11:43.117]  It's that they actually want to take away Google's dominance.
[00:11:43.137 --> 00:11:44.277]  93% of global web searches.
[00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:48.338]  But for all intents and purposes, Google is gone.
[00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:50.559]  Google is dead.
[00:11:51.701 --> 00:12:00.724]  So even things like Startpage and things that are great folks and give you web browsing protection, interface with Google and other systems, and it's totally broken.
[00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:07.967]  When it comes to medical news, you name it, anti-gun news, you name it, it force-feeds garbage.
[00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:15.230]  And we have the documents, we have the internal documents, where their job is to, quote, silence people like Alex Jones.
[00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.010]  It's outrageous.
[00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.032]  And Trump can still go on Fox News.
[00:12:21.138 --> 00:12:23.459]  But that is an aging and smaller audience.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:36.227]  His real power, where there were hundreds of viral videos a week with tens of millions of views, we had videos with 37 million views, 40 million views, 50 million views, that were just deleted after the election.
[00:12:36.587 --> 00:12:37.267]  No reason given.
[00:12:38.448 --> 00:12:39.329]  They were all pro-Trump.
[00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.793]  And then, they started ratcheting down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, to nothing.
[00:12:48.254 --> 00:12:51.578]  To where it's going to be on our pages to even see our material.
[00:12:51.918 --> 00:12:53.860]  And the president has been warned about this.
[00:12:54.121 --> 00:12:55.562]  He's made some statements about it.
[00:12:55.923 --> 00:12:57.945]  But we have serious antitrust issues.
[00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:00.948]  We have serious racketeering issues.
[00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:03.851]  We have serious anti-free speech collusion.
[00:13:04.152 --> 00:13:07.596]  And they're targeting Christians, conservatives, libertarians, nationalists.
[00:13:07.636 --> 00:13:09.378]  Listen, in the same week,
[00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:20.555]  Apple and Google removed on their calendars Easter and other Christian holidays, and then on those days did doodles about atheists and communists.
[00:13:20.896 --> 00:13:22.458]  You know, the doodle at the top of the page.
[00:13:23.078 --> 00:13:26.503]  And they said, no, we removed Christian stuff on purpose!
[00:13:29.687 --> 00:13:34.433]  But then I have CNN promoting Ramadan yesterday.
[00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:45.567]  Coming up, I'm going to break it down with a slideshow about how to behave during Ramadan and the etiquette you should have for the Islamification of everything under Ramadan.
[00:13:46.007 --> 00:13:48.551]  And of course, they're famously been paid billions of dollars.
[00:13:49.827 --> 00:13:53.288]  By Arab Gulf Dictatorship States.
[00:13:53.728 --> 00:13:56.569]  And of course, Amber Lyon was the first award-winning journalist.
[00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:06.253]  Six years ago in 2012, to expose it, CNN journalist Mainstream Media takes money from foreign dictators to run flattering propaganda.
[00:14:06.473 --> 00:14:08.673]  That's right, they are total fake news.
[00:14:08.693 --> 00:14:10.314]  They take money from George Soros.
[00:14:11.775 --> 00:14:18.621]  CNN does to say he was not a Nazi collaborator when he 100% was and admitted it on 60 Minutes and wrote a book about it.
[00:14:19.462 --> 00:14:22.605]  It is just incredible next-level fake news.
[00:14:22.845 --> 00:14:32.234]  So Trump's problem is, for 2018 and beyond, he's having his legs cut out from under him and he has a responsibility to go up against those attacking our free speech.
[00:14:32.474 --> 00:14:36.478]  He's starting to do some of it saying, hey, China's manipulating our news, it's a big problem.
[00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.472]  China's taking over our universities, it's a problem.
[00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:42.093]  Hey, Hollywood's getting bought by China, it's a problem.
[00:14:42.413 --> 00:14:43.373]  It's beyond that.
[00:14:44.353 --> 00:14:46.454]  And we need Congress to move on this now.
[00:14:48.415 --> 00:14:56.037]  They've started to, but the Republicans are so ignorant, like the Democrats during the Diamond and Silk hearing, that they just don't get what's happening.
[00:14:56.497 --> 00:15:00.319]  Now, we're going to go to break and come back with the incredible leakers inside
[00:15:01.428 --> 00:15:12.123]  The White House, also the leaks coming out confirming that the FBI under Obama and Hillary was spying on Trump beyond Watergate.
[00:15:13.105 --> 00:15:14.407]  There's so much coming up.
[00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:16.775]  We're going to break right now.
[00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:23.939]  Please remember that it's your financial support of this operation that allows us to be up on the satellites, that allows us to be reaching more people.
[00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:28.902]  And that's where we're exploding is on TV and radio, the only area they're not able to suppress us.
[00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:33.465]  But it costs a lot of money to put this out and to build these studios and to try to hire these people.
[00:15:33.865 --> 00:15:35.346]  I don't want them to make us contract.
[00:15:35.506 --> 00:15:36.447]  I want to expand.
[00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:39.008]  So please visit Infowarestore.com.

[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.243]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:25.665]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin.
[00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:32.867]  And it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[00:16:32.967 --> 00:16:35.308]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:37.229]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:40.069]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible.
[00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.851]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time.
[00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:51.233]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[00:16:51.693 --> 00:16:56.214]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[00:16:56.694 --> 00:16:57.834]  That helps with focus, too.
[00:16:58.274 --> 00:16:59.254]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:03.875]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[00:17:04.295 --> 00:17:08.336]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[00:17:08.596 --> 00:17:10.136]  There's definitely been a change.
[00:17:10.416 --> 00:17:11.057]  For the better.
[00:17:11.477 --> 00:17:15.237]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[00:17:15.657 --> 00:17:17.338]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[00:17:17.738 --> 00:17:18.618]  I hope this lasts.
[00:17:19.478 --> 00:17:21.541]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[00:17:21.821 --> 00:17:27.949]  I took alpha power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[00:17:28.249 --> 00:17:33.196]  I take super male and brain force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[00:17:33.656 --> 00:17:36.940]  Defeat the globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:39.163]  Taking one capsule a day in the a.m.
[00:17:39.463 --> 00:17:42.606]  and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.948]  I'd feel exhausted after 8 p.m.
[00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:45.748]  Not anymore.
[00:17:46.129 --> 00:17:47.310]  Seem to be sleeping better too.
[00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.712]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[00:17:49.952 --> 00:17:51.333]  I will definitely buy this again.
[00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:55.477]  Head to infowarrestore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[00:17:56.157 --> 00:17:58.359]  That's infowarrestore.com.
[00:18:02.803 --> 00:18:04.945]  It's gonna get more twilight zone from here.
[00:18:11.198 --> 00:18:15.327]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:18:20.612 --> 00:18:30.118]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[00:18:30.238 --> 00:18:31.059]  It got ugly.
[00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:32.140]  Violence erupting at the event.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.120]  Fights broke out.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.744]  Fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[00:18:38.804 --> 00:18:43.967]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[00:18:43.987 --> 00:18:44.668]  You wanna fight?
[00:18:44.688 --> 00:18:46.129]  You gotta believe!
[00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.769]  You gotta believe!
[00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:52.968]  You say he's not your president?
[00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.089]  Then you shouldn't be here!
[00:18:54.209 --> 00:18:56.810]  Don't put the brain together!
[00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:57.791]  You got that?
[00:18:57.871 --> 00:18:59.452]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.505]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:09.006]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:09.066 --> 00:19:09.426]  Go ahead.
[00:19:09.526 --> 00:19:09.806]  Yes.
[00:19:10.246 --> 00:19:10.967]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:17.271]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:21.473]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:23.154]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:23.494 --> 00:19:33.160]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:38.722]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:46.604]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:46.624 --> 00:19:52.445]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:57.867]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:57.907 --> 00:20:00.968]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[00:20:06.815 --> 00:20:09.557]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.845 --> 00:20:28.829]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:31.931]  By the way, I've read the book.
[00:20:32.031 --> 00:20:32.672]  It's amazing.
[00:20:32.692 --> 00:20:36.373]  He sent us 500 free ones, but I ordered a couple thousand more that are coming in next week.
[00:20:36.813 --> 00:20:39.254]  It doesn't officially ship out until, what, the 24th.
[00:20:40.214 --> 00:20:43.715]  But it's the killing of Uncle Sam, the demise of the United States of America.
[00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:45.436]  You've got to read this.
[00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:47.137]  This is what the globalists are trying to do.
[00:20:47.637 --> 00:20:50.418]  This is a true next-level Paul Revere warning.
[00:20:50.938 --> 00:20:53.339]  And he wrote it with a bunch of former top CIA people.
[00:20:54.352 --> 00:20:54.873]  I don't know.
[00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:21.592]  Uh, he said that he basically, well, he'll tell you once he gets on air, uh, what, what God told him about what Infowars is going to do.
[00:21:22.252 --> 00:21:23.173]  And, you know, I can feel that.
[00:21:23.213 --> 00:21:29.775]  I can see that as well, but also the great work he does reaching hundreds of millions of people, uh, just over international television and traveling all over the world.
[00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:35.618]  And more and more, I realized we're going to put this network up and go basically 24 hours a day around the world.
[00:21:36.937 --> 00:21:42.302]  But that more and more it's going to be on the ground reporting with correspondents all over the planet.
[00:21:42.342 --> 00:21:43.402]  That's really my vision.
[00:21:43.723 --> 00:21:51.329]  And I hadn't really even told him that, that it wasn't even for the United States, but that I wanted later to turn on satellites all over the world, which will cost a lot of money.
[00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.370]  And that's the thing.
[00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.333]  I just did a 30-second plug last segment about some of the products.
[00:21:56.313 --> 00:22:00.257]  If I don't plug more, we won't bring the money in because they banned us off Google Ads.
[00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:03.175]  They're banning us off every platform.
[00:22:03.195 --> 00:22:05.277]  I don't even want to say this stuff behind the scenes.
[00:22:06.638 --> 00:22:07.399]  I'm not a victim.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.161]  But I know this.
[00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:14.607]  Draconian harassment of major sporting goods stores.
[00:22:15.808 --> 00:22:16.349]  Churches.
[00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.590]  It's not just us, it's everybody.
[00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.851]  We have a voice, so you're getting to hear about it.
[00:22:22.431 --> 00:22:26.312]  This is really draconian, and it's going on despite the fact Trump's in office.
[00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:35.253]  You know, it's come out in the news, the IRS is still persecuting Christians and 501c3s, and not letting veterans groups and others get their tax exemption.
[00:22:36.453 --> 00:22:37.594]  People say, well, Trump better stop it.
[00:22:38.014 --> 00:22:41.374]  They won't even put his signs up, his picture at the VA.
[00:22:42.454 --> 00:22:43.995]  They have to send congressmen in.
[00:22:44.275 --> 00:22:45.215]  There's video of this.
[00:22:46.525 --> 00:22:50.246]  After he's been in office over a year to say, put the president's picture up!
[00:22:51.626 --> 00:22:56.108]  And they put the president's picture up, and a day later it's gone, and Obama's back up there.
[00:22:56.928 --> 00:23:04.650]  There is total rebellion in this country by the globalists, by the Democrats, and the giant hordes of illegal aliens they're bringing in.
[00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.351]  This is the attempted takedown of this country.
[00:23:07.651 --> 00:23:12.252]  And I'm just here raising the alarm, because I want to come on air and be calm about all this, but
[00:23:14.989 --> 00:23:17.850]  It is incredibly intense what's going on.
[00:23:19.191 --> 00:23:26.855]  And then I see all these traitor conservatives and mainline churches, they won't say a word about what's going on out in the real world.
[00:23:27.844 --> 00:23:30.366]  A lot of these churches think if they just shut up, they'll be left alone.
[00:23:30.386 --> 00:23:32.948]  Well now, the Methodist churches are pulling the crosses out.
[00:23:33.468 --> 00:23:39.313]  In Europe, mainline churches are pulling their crosses out and saying, we have Muslim Ramadan in the churches now.
[00:23:39.673 --> 00:23:41.114]  We're being overrun.
[00:23:41.234 --> 00:23:42.495]  We're being overtaken.
[00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:43.936]  We're being captured.
[00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:47.499]  This is a world war against humanity.
[00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:49.200]  This is a total culture war.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.382]  A total, complete takeover.
[00:23:52.983 --> 00:23:53.984]  And now I'm ranting.
[00:23:54.424 --> 00:23:55.605]  Let me get back into the news here.
[00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:58.320]  There's so much I want to get to.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:03.365]  Next segment, I'm going to do the whole Ramadan thing, because wait until you see this.
[00:24:03.445 --> 00:24:05.247]  It's just par for the course.
[00:24:05.988 --> 00:24:10.012]  But before I go any further, let's just get into this little piece of news.
[00:24:12.354 --> 00:24:15.417]  Leakers confirm to the New York Times
[00:24:16.482 --> 00:24:19.344]  That FBI ran spy operation against Trump campaign.
[00:24:19.924 --> 00:24:23.866]  Well, we've known it was Samantha Powers and Barack Obama that ran that.
[00:24:23.906 --> 00:24:25.027]  We know from the FISA court.
[00:24:25.407 --> 00:24:26.468]  We know what they filled out.
[00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:28.269]  They were so arrogant when he was president-elect.
[00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:30.710]  They said, oh, we've been spying on him.
[00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:33.312]  We've got the proof of all the bad things he's done.
[00:24:33.332 --> 00:24:34.052]  And Trump went, really?
[00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:38.275]  That's illegal to do that and to say you're doing it because that's a leak.
[00:24:38.295 --> 00:24:42.297]  They went, oh, we actually never said that in early 2017.
[00:24:44.693 --> 00:24:59.454]  And now Comey and Mueller and all of them have testified before Congress and said we were not surveilling the president or anybody in Trump Tower or anybody in his campaign because that'd be campaign meddling by the Democratic Party.
[00:25:00.367 --> 00:25:15.336]  But they did do it, and now it's all coming out, and Rosenstein will not give Congress any of the documents for the House Oversight Committee, or the House Intelligence Committee, when they're co-equal with the Executive.
[00:25:15.536 --> 00:25:17.577]  But the Executive is saying, release it!
[00:25:18.357 --> 00:25:22.400]  The President's saying, release it to Congress, with their intelligence clearings.
[00:25:23.513 --> 00:25:23.974]  Clarence's?
[00:25:24.414 --> 00:25:27.018]  And they're saying, no, we can't show it.
[00:25:27.578 --> 00:25:31.403]  And Mueller's saying, no, no, no, because we know what it is.
[00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:35.549]  It was in the New York Times in late November and December 2016.
[00:25:35.649 --> 00:25:37.652]  We can pull the articles up.
[00:25:39.158 --> 00:25:49.607]  And it said right there, well, Obama administration is quietly passing out the evidence it found while surveilling the Trump campaign of wrongdoing and collusion.
[00:25:49.927 --> 00:25:51.929]  So Trump's gonna be brought down, don't worry.
[00:25:52.129 --> 00:25:57.534]  They were saying that so the Democrats in government and people wouldn't follow their new elected president.
[00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:04.120]  So that people wouldn't be aware of what was going on.
[00:26:06.451 --> 00:26:09.613]  That Trump was actually removing their criminal operation.
[00:26:10.033 --> 00:26:12.115]  They were there saying, no, no, no, we're going to win.
[00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:12.675]  Don't worry.
[00:26:12.715 --> 00:26:13.515]  We've got evidence.
[00:26:14.016 --> 00:26:15.296]  We surveilled Trump.
[00:26:15.336 --> 00:26:15.977]  He's a traitor.
[00:26:16.837 --> 00:26:17.518]  Trump gets in.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.684]  Admiral Rogers from the NSA comes to him and says, sir, you were illegally spied on at Trump Tower.
[00:26:29.164 --> 00:26:30.525]  What, a week before he was sworn in?
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.142]  And Trump now knows everything that happened.
[00:26:35.782 --> 00:26:44.791]  And so now you see people, like the former head of the NSA and CIA, Hayden, in the news last week, saying, just hold on, hold on.
[00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:46.292]  If you're in government, hold on.
[00:26:46.852 --> 00:26:48.013]  Don't do what Trump says.
[00:26:48.294 --> 00:26:49.335]  He'll be gone soon.
[00:26:49.495 --> 00:26:50.416]  That is sedition.
[00:26:50.636 --> 00:26:51.477]  That is treason.
[00:26:51.517 --> 00:26:53.719]  That is unbelievable criminal activity.
[00:26:53.739 --> 00:26:57.602]  That is mutiny within the government against the executive branch.
[00:26:57.942 --> 00:26:59.484]  That's what you call a soft coup.
[00:27:03.914 --> 00:27:05.314]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:27:06.555 --> 00:27:07.595]  But he said something else.
[00:27:07.655 --> 00:27:09.676]  He said, he said it on television.
[00:27:09.736 --> 00:27:10.796]  We played the clip last week.
[00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:13.417]  He said, but if, or was it two weeks ago?
[00:27:14.657 --> 00:27:24.120]  He said, if you haven't been in government in a while and he's trying to hire you, don't work with him or you'll be blackballed once we throw him out.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.061]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:27.961]  Hayden, don't work for Trump administration.
[00:27:30.142 --> 00:27:30.602]  Last week.
[00:27:34.636 --> 00:27:36.357]  Takes a lot of nerve, doesn't it?
[00:27:37.437 --> 00:27:38.957]  But that's what they're doing!
[00:27:39.798 --> 00:27:41.758]  And so they've lied to us at every front.
[00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:48.781]  And I know you as listeners, or you who are politically involved, politically aware, you remember all this, but the general public doesn't.
[00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:57.424]  And now Mueller is well into his second year of fraud, and has been caught lying on every front, and still he's there.
[00:27:58.683 --> 00:28:00.724]  Because they have nothing to lose.
[00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:04.165]  They're not going to give up until they've removed the president.
[00:28:04.525 --> 00:28:15.188]  And at a certain point, he just can't sit back and watch them censor the internet, and send the IRS after tens of thousands of churches, and bully people, and cut off the aid to the veterans at the VA.
[00:28:15.648 --> 00:28:22.150]  All of this is purposeful by these arrogant, monstrous, narcissistic, demonically possessed people.
[00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.491]  I mean, put that photo back up for TV viewers of Hayden.
[00:28:25.331 --> 00:28:30.935]  And have you ever watched him speak and just how much he's into himself and how arrogant they are.
[00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:34.497]  These people have a spirit of just unending arrogance.
[00:28:35.537 --> 00:28:39.119]  And they're always pathetic and stupid and twisted.
[00:28:41.501 --> 00:28:41.961]  Amazing.
[00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:46.524]  But Trump has congratulated Mueller on second year of greatest witch hunt in American history.
[00:28:46.544 --> 00:28:49.266]  We'll read some of those quotes straight ahead and then...
[00:28:50.219 --> 00:28:52.123]  Well, look at what just happened in the attacks in Israel.
[00:28:52.444 --> 00:29:00.019]  It turns out almost every one of the dead protesters shot by the Israelis was Hamas with suicide bombs and hand grenades.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:00.720]  We'll be back.
[00:29:02.594 --> 00:29:09.236]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[00:29:09.896 --> 00:29:11.697]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[00:29:12.297 --> 00:29:18.159]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:21.200]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.502]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:29:24.862 --> 00:29:30.784]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:29:31.425 --> 00:29:37.888]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:29:38.268 --> 00:29:44.171]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:29:44.631 --> 00:29:48.232]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:29:48.733 --> 00:29:56.936]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[00:29:57.336 --> 00:30:03.559]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:09.026]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news.
[00:30:09.666 --> 00:30:17.767]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:30:18.327 --> 00:30:19.988]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:30:20.528 --> 00:30:27.489]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this, because it is pure atomic iodine.
[00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:32.950]  Everything else out there is bound, or it's contaminated, it's not absorbable, it's toxic.
[00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:40.016]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[00:30:40.036 --> 00:30:45.762]  And it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[00:30:45.902 --> 00:30:48.404]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:30:49.145 --> 00:30:56.611]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[00:30:56.671 --> 00:30:57.532]  They used to make drugs.
[00:30:57.712 --> 00:31:01.695]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[00:31:02.115 --> 00:31:06.819]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.962]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[00:31:11.263 --> 00:31:15.126]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:31:15.706 --> 00:31:18.448]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[00:31:18.468 --> 00:31:19.609]  We have a good supply right now.
[00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.391]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[00:31:21.831 --> 00:31:24.113]  But this may be the clincher.
[00:31:24.153 --> 00:31:27.375]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[00:31:27.816 --> 00:31:31.198]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:31:31.659 --> 00:31:33.800]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[00:31:34.141 --> 00:31:35.502]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:31:35.862 --> 00:31:43.228]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[00:31:43.528 --> 00:31:44.389]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:45.089 --> 00:31:45.189]  Yeah.
[00:31:59.906 --> 00:32:00.507]  Pure iodine.
[00:32:00.887 --> 00:32:01.608]  Pure iodine.
[00:32:01.708 --> 00:32:05.853]  You will end up having all sorts of disorders, just like water, just like oxygen.
[00:32:06.173 --> 00:32:08.295]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:09.897]  It's available exclusively.
[00:32:10.177 --> 00:32:14.122]  Survival Shield X2 at Infowarslife.com and Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:15.463]  And I hope, like a few years ago,
[00:32:16.573 --> 00:32:17.754]  That we can work this out.
[00:32:35.874 --> 00:32:38.655]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[00:32:38.995 --> 00:32:47.338]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[00:32:47.878 --> 00:32:52.200]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:59.202]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:06.346 --> 00:33:10.849]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:33.286]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.307 --> 00:33:41.564]  You know, it's been known for over a decade.
[00:33:42.995 --> 00:34:01.786]  But now, people have kind of forgotten about it, that CNN has gotten billions of dollars total for CNN International, but also CNN right here in the United States, from Gulf state dictators, Eastern European corrupt bureaucracies, the EU, you name it.
[00:34:02.487 --> 00:34:10.692]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has spent hundreds of millions of dollars we know of to put out particular pieces of propaganda.
[00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:28.688]  And if you go back to journalists from CNN who exposed that many, many years ago, you can see the reports for yourself, like Amber Lyon, CNN journalist, mainstream media takes money from foreign dictators to run flattering propaganda.
[00:34:31.223 --> 00:34:34.125]  We'll get to more of this in a moment, but look at this story out of Town Hall.
[00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:50.637]  Hamas wins media support, calls 50 dead terrorist martyrs, but admits that they were Hamas members who were attacking and trying to come over the Israeli border, some of which had suicide vests, and who even brought their children.
[00:34:51.198 --> 00:34:58.443]  So 50 of the 62 were full-grown men, Hamas members, who then brought their little children to the riot.
[00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:03.098]  But then CNN helps basically spin all that.
[00:35:03.118 --> 00:35:18.828]  So with that background, last night I go check out enemy propaganda, CNN, and I see, learn how to behave, is the headline, during Ramadan.
[00:35:20.529 --> 00:35:28.514]  And then it goes through the 10 helpful tips of how you should behave during Ramadan.
[00:35:29.497 --> 00:35:34.599]  There's several articles we've got here on screen, the slideshow that it goes through.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:50.884]  Now, looking at the slideshow, it goes through and explains, oh, there's 1.8 billion Muslims.
[00:35:50.924 --> 00:35:51.385]  I kept saying 1.5.
[00:35:52.005 --> 00:35:53.845]  I'm sorry, it's now more than that.
[00:35:54.146 --> 00:35:56.446]  And it's set to be 3.3 billion soon, they say.
[00:35:59.502 --> 00:36:06.004]  And they go on to say, you can totally eat in front of us, but try not to schedule a work lunch.
[00:36:06.784 --> 00:36:07.625]  Don't, don't do that.
[00:36:07.685 --> 00:36:08.265]  That's mean.
[00:36:09.785 --> 00:36:18.108]  It goes on to say, you don't have to fast with us, but it'd be nice if you do, but you can also join us at night during our feast.
[00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:19.889]  Five.
[00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:27.151]  You don't have to know when it begins, but please be a little flexible to us.
[00:36:29.667 --> 00:36:45.821]  And it shows all these glowing happy pictures of Muslim women, not wearing full burqas, not being blown up in suicide bombs, not being sold into sex slavery in North Africa, not the classic giant Ramadan bombings that always massively intensify.
[00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:53.588]  It's a big, disgusting, sickening, deceptive PR piece, probably paid for.
[00:36:55.219 --> 00:36:56.200]  By the Islamicist.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:03.543]  But I've got another set of articles here about other Ramadan propaganda that has been paid for for U.S.
[00:37:03.603 --> 00:37:04.364]  News this year.
[00:37:06.585 --> 00:37:07.585]  And it goes on from there.
[00:37:09.486 --> 00:37:12.768]  We'll still go out for coffee with you but won't drink any.
[00:37:13.909 --> 00:37:15.369]  But we may keep our distance.
[00:37:19.731 --> 00:37:22.473]  Can you say Ramadan Mubarak?
[00:37:24.366 --> 00:37:28.589]  It goes on to say, there's no war on Christmas level controversy surrounding the greeting.
[00:37:29.049 --> 00:37:30.650]  Oh, because it's Islamic, you're allowed to say it.
[00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:38.395]  So they said, so it's okay to say, Happy Ramadan.
[00:37:39.035 --> 00:37:39.715]  Isn't that nice?
[00:37:39.776 --> 00:37:44.078]  They say, there's not a war on Christmas controversy, because you don't say Merry Christmas.
[00:37:44.779 --> 00:37:46.240]  So they're admitting there's a war on Christmas.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.001]  They're saying, but you're allowed to say this.
[00:37:49.401 --> 00:37:51.243]  Don't you love how CNN tells you
[00:37:52.489 --> 00:38:06.894]  How you're allowed to speak, what you're allowed to do, how you're supposed to think, and they talk to you like you're a three-year-old, and then tell you with all these glowing pictures and glowing text, how great Ramadan is.
[00:38:07.154 --> 00:38:11.436]  But please don't say, I should fast too, I need to lose weight.
[00:38:14.144 --> 00:38:16.345]  And of course, this is nothing compared to the usual propaganda.
[00:38:16.405 --> 00:38:17.485]  It gets far worse than this.
[00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:25.908]  In Germany, we've shown it, they run national TV ads with their hip-hop and rock stars saying, I wear the hijab, I've joined Islam.
[00:38:26.008 --> 00:38:26.829]  Paid for by the government.
[00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:35.352]  They have children's daytime television, after-school programs, where 14-year-old girls marry 25-year-old men who are Muslim.
[00:38:35.392 --> 00:38:38.453]  And it's a good thing, even though it's illegal under German law.
[00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:49.813]  The Finnish court last week ruled that a 25-year-old man could have sex with a 10-year-old girl because it's his religion and Mohammed had sex with nine-year-olds.
[00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:56.975]  So the Muslims get to follow one set of rules, Sharia, and the governments are bifurcating it now to actually follow it.
[00:38:57.075 --> 00:38:59.716]  I used to hear people warn about this 20 years ago.
[00:38:59.796 --> 00:39:01.016]  I thought they were crazy.
[00:39:01.996 --> 00:39:03.957]  But I wasn't thinking about parliamentary systems.
[00:39:04.477 --> 00:39:06.978]  In Europe, on average, they've got more than 10 parties per country.
[00:39:08.015 --> 00:39:09.976]  The biggest party usually gets 20-30% of the vote.
[00:39:10.316 --> 00:39:15.198]  If you've got Muslims that are 10-20% of the population, it's checkmate because they vote as a bloc.
[00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:16.439]  It's game over.
[00:39:21.141 --> 00:39:21.622]  Game over.
[00:39:24.563 --> 00:39:25.924]  And that's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:39:26.004 --> 00:39:27.124]  We are being conquered.
[00:39:27.184 --> 00:39:32.607]  And all the media, CNN, Apple, Google,
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.762]  They take Christianity off their calendars.
[00:39:35.822 --> 00:39:37.243]  They put down Christianity.
[00:39:37.544 --> 00:39:39.065]  They tell you don't say Merry Christmas.
[00:39:43.789 --> 00:39:47.293]  But, when it comes to Muslims, they force-feed it.
[00:39:48.994 --> 00:39:51.897]  And so that's what this is all about, because the globalists see the demographics.
[00:39:52.137 --> 00:39:54.159]  Europe is having 1.3 children on average.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.424]  The average Muslim has six children, and the decision has been made to not get them to
[00:40:01.138 --> 00:40:07.264]  Get in the melting pot with us, and then give up their really radical, out-of-control system, where every Muslim country is in turmoil.
[00:40:07.464 --> 00:40:10.787]  They're always killing each other, fighting over who's the most extreme.
[00:40:11.627 --> 00:40:14.410]  It's like importing cancer into your country.
[00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:16.772]  It always wants to take you over.
[00:40:17.012 --> 00:40:19.415]  There is the House of Islam, and there is the House of War.
[00:40:19.735 --> 00:40:22.137]  Everything outside the House of Islam is the House of War.
[00:40:23.498 --> 00:40:27.422]  Germans to work into their 70s to pay refugee welfare.
[00:40:29.161 --> 00:40:30.983]  That's being announced by the German newspapers.
[00:40:31.704 --> 00:40:33.926]  You cannot make that up.
[00:40:34.467 --> 00:40:37.670]  Migrants surge from Turkey nine times greater than last year.
[00:40:38.011 --> 00:40:41.254]  Because what did the dictator of Turkey say?
[00:40:41.294 --> 00:40:48.642]  He said, you let me set up Turkish parties in every country, then the Muslims will vote for the Turkish party, and then they will have control
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:41:00.926]  With that tipping group of Europe, and Germany said no, and other countries banned the Islamic parties, because they get it's a total takeover, they just don't want it to happen that fast, and so he now just opened the borders up.
[00:41:02.366 --> 00:41:03.727]  Can you see the economic terrorism?
[00:41:05.468 --> 00:41:06.088]  Trudeau!
[00:41:06.528 --> 00:41:10.030]  Government welcomes back former ISIS fighters, offers counseling!
[00:41:11.311 --> 00:41:17.654]  Yeah, remember the guy that shot the army officer at their capital in Ottawa?
[00:41:18.499 --> 00:41:23.584]  And what they do, they let the guy basically go that did it and said you didn't do anything wrong.
[00:41:24.004 --> 00:41:24.805]  And now it's the same thing.
[00:41:24.845 --> 00:41:33.132]  Justin Trudeau's administration says that Canadians who leave their country to join ISIS have a right to return and will be offered counseling to the terrorist sympathizers.
[00:41:33.152 --> 00:41:41.580]  Yeah, you go fight to kill non-radical Muslims and Christians and put people into sex slavery, you get your butt kicked by the Russians, and then you come back to Canada.
[00:41:43.595 --> 00:41:51.180]  Remember, oh, he took mankind out of their national anthem, and they put in federal documents two months ago, no more mother and father.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.901]  Don't put it on forms, or you will be prosecuted.
[00:41:53.981 --> 00:41:55.482]  Mother and father is evil.
[00:41:56.903 --> 00:41:58.324]  It doesn't even sound real, does it?
[00:42:00.105 --> 00:42:05.909]  Migrant calls host racist, says women should be slaughtered, quote, if they don't shut up.
[00:42:07.113 --> 00:42:09.795]  That's a EuropeWars.com, our new European Bureau.
[00:42:10.075 --> 00:42:13.058]  By the way, we've just been posting these articles on EuropeWars.com.
[00:42:13.398 --> 00:42:17.661]  I want to post, like, part of the articles on InfoWars, and then have the rest send the traffic there.
[00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:18.722]  I think that's the best model.
[00:42:19.083 --> 00:42:23.967]  Because so many of these stories I don't see, because I go to InfoWars.com and I forget to go to EuropeWars.com.
[00:42:26.469 --> 00:42:27.710]  And please, spread these links, folks.
[00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:28.470]  It's how we're getting them out.
[00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.091]  It's how we're getting around the censors.
[00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:31.733]  When you do this, it's devastating them.
[00:42:32.739 --> 00:42:34.000]  EU Migration Chief.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.940]  Europe must accept endless migrants.
[00:42:36.241 --> 00:42:38.842]  Dan Lyman, another Europe Wars story.
[00:42:38.942 --> 00:42:39.482]  Powerful.
[00:42:39.962 --> 00:42:42.123]  And it's from the UN and the EU themselves.
[00:42:42.463 --> 00:42:46.545]  They say they want 200 million more Muslims by 2030.
[00:42:47.625 --> 00:42:50.547]  Wow.
[00:42:51.407 --> 00:42:54.048]  You think, you know, 50 million's burning down Europe.
[00:42:54.408 --> 00:42:57.589]  Imagine 200 mil voting as one bloc.
[00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.610]  That's total control of Europe.
[00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.811]  Total control.
[00:43:02.731 --> 00:43:17.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[00:43:19.481 --> 00:43:25.585]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.521]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[00:43:30.321 --> 00:43:33.742]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[00:43:34.682 --> 00:43:36.863]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[00:43:38.563 --> 00:43:43.765]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[00:43:45.685 --> 00:43:52.307]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[00:43:53.268 --> 00:43:54.228]  It's up to us personally.
[00:43:55.655 --> 00:44:02.510]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[00:44:03.011 --> 00:44:04.313]  I expected that to happen.
[00:44:05.496 --> 00:44:06.839]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:44:08.823 --> 00:44:19.729]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:21.990]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[00:44:22.671 --> 00:44:34.297]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[00:44:34.877 --> 00:44:37.079]  And we've already come so far together
[00:44:38.103 --> 00:44:47.108]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[00:44:47.688 --> 00:44:53.111]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[00:44:54.232 --> 00:45:02.096]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[00:45:04.355 --> 00:45:09.079]  But if you look at the Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.602]  Another 10% or so worldwide.
[00:45:12.942 --> 00:45:14.583]  That's a conservative estimate.
[00:45:15.584 --> 00:45:18.246]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[00:45:19.047 --> 00:45:20.868]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[00:45:20.908 --> 00:45:25.792]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[00:45:26.893 --> 00:45:37.667]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[00:45:37.727 --> 00:45:41.693]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:43.736]  Our game changing.
[00:45:44.176 --> 00:45:45.677]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[00:45:45.877 --> 00:45:47.018]  The other equation of probiotic.
[00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:50.641]  It's now stronger and a lower price in FullWorthStore.com.
[00:45:50.961 --> 00:45:52.062]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[00:45:52.142 --> 00:45:56.505]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[00:45:57.046 --> 00:46:00.108]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[00:46:00.188 --> 00:46:01.409]  It just does incredible things.
[00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:03.290]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:06.293]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[00:46:06.313 --> 00:46:08.835]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:46:09.355 --> 00:46:14.181]  That's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[00:46:14.822 --> 00:46:29.279]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there, Silver Sol Nano Silver Iodine
[00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:33.281]  The ionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[00:46:33.321 --> 00:46:34.622]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[00:46:34.822 --> 00:46:36.022]  You can swallow it as well.
[00:46:36.403 --> 00:46:42.686]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:43.006 --> 00:46:44.387]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:46:44.407 --> 00:46:54.012]  So, thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:46:54.312 --> 00:46:57.374]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:08.989]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.794]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:47:41.335 --> 00:47:43.601]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:55.416]  So, Western culture, Christian culture is under attack by Hollywood, the big megacorporations, big tech, Islam, you name it.
[00:47:56.056 --> 00:48:02.020]  I can't go to any Islamic country and try to set up a church or go out and preach the Bible.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.502]  You will get killed so fast it'll make your head spin.
[00:48:05.263 --> 00:48:09.506]  Women can't go to these Islamic countries and not be wearing a scarf or headdress.
[00:48:09.566 --> 00:48:10.166]  That's a fact.
[00:48:10.847 --> 00:48:13.549]  But then we're told we're going to bring something in that's incompatible.
[00:48:16.257 --> 00:48:17.617]  So that's why I'm so upset.
[00:48:17.697 --> 00:48:29.221]  And I was against the wars, by the way, because that was by the globalists to go destabilize those countries even more to put the worst Muslims in charge, then get rid of Europe's borders and flood Europe and flood Russia.
[00:48:29.981 --> 00:48:34.042]  But Russia is saying no, and that's why Russia is under attack.
[00:48:36.443 --> 00:48:45.126]  Now, I'm done talking about that for now, but it is such a big deal that the New York Times has had to admit
[00:48:46.508 --> 00:48:58.594]  A head of Congress making the man that tried to make himself the head of the Justice Department, who actually changed the way the Justice Department works, tricked the President into signing it on January 21st.
[00:49:00.515 --> 00:49:03.296]  Rosenstein changed the whole structure where he's in charge.
[00:49:03.316 --> 00:49:05.697]  Well, the President can sign an order changing that anytime.
[00:49:07.318 --> 00:49:13.621]  But they've buffaloed the President into believing that if he removes any of these people that are rogue, mad dogs,
[00:49:14.929 --> 00:49:24.353]  Like Mueller or Rosenstein or Strzok or any of these scumbags like McCabe, who he has made to step down, that somehow it shows he's guilty.
[00:49:24.373 --> 00:49:29.316]  That's like saying, let somebody burn your house down or it proves you're guilty.
[00:49:33.077 --> 00:49:34.458]  Trump has delivered on every front.
[00:49:34.878 --> 00:49:36.739]  They have been all over Trump and found no corruption.
[00:49:38.052 --> 00:49:46.799]  Now they found his lawyer got money from a drug company and from AT&T, totally normal, as a lobbyist that he's been lobbying for years, had nothing to do with anything?
[00:49:47.439 --> 00:49:49.341]  Trump's the one that wouldn't hire one lobbyist!
[00:49:49.621 --> 00:49:50.962]  He's cut lobbying back 95%!
[00:49:52.683 --> 00:49:56.807]  Almost every lobbying firm, including Republicans, are against this president!
[00:49:57.067 --> 00:50:01.430]  You think the lobbyists like him when the whole media and all the lobbyists are against him?
[00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:02.091]  No!
[00:50:05.054 --> 00:50:16.344]  They are against the President because he is trying to turn the economy back on, and trying to control the borders, and trying to fix the VA, and trying to stand up to China, and trying to get peace deals with North Korea.
[00:50:19.707 --> 00:50:26.153]  And in response, Bolton, the big neocon, people said, oh, well, Trump will control him.
[00:50:26.314 --> 00:50:26.634]  Oh, really?
[00:50:26.954 --> 00:50:27.775]  Just like McMaster?
[00:50:27.995 --> 00:50:29.697]  Running around saying the opposite of what the President says?
[00:50:31.038 --> 00:50:36.059]  Telling North Korea, oh, we're going to do to you what we did to Libya, so they don't have a peace deal.
[00:50:36.919 --> 00:50:37.460]  It's incredible.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:44.301]  I've got so much news here it makes my head spin, but we've got an amazing pastor joining us in the next hour.
[00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:47.222]  You can pre-order this big old beautiful hardcover book.
[00:50:47.702 --> 00:50:49.423]  It starts shipping next week.
[00:50:50.163 --> 00:50:58.705]  It is The Killing of Uncle Sam, The Demise of the United States of America, and I'm sitting on a bunch of these right now, and I got more coming in because I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[00:51:00.005 --> 00:51:00.725]  Pre-order it now.
[00:51:00.905 --> 00:51:01.545]  Get it first.
[00:51:01.986 --> 00:51:03.806]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:51:04.346 --> 00:51:05.426]  The Killing of Uncle Sam.
[00:51:05.466 --> 00:51:10.087]  I'm really, really excited about this book and the advisors and the people he had that wrote it.
[00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:13.528]  It's the real history of the world and the future.
[00:51:13.608 --> 00:51:18.309]  Kind of the book I want to write, but that obviously CNN and others have tried to get boycotted.
[00:51:18.889 --> 00:51:21.430]  I've called it the secret history of the world and the war for the future.
[00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:22.730]  And you read this,
[00:51:23.888 --> 00:51:25.768]  And I thought I knew a lot of stuff, and I do know a lot.
[00:51:25.808 --> 00:51:27.709]  I know how accurate it is, but a lot of this I didn't even know.
[00:51:28.449 --> 00:51:34.130]  So, if you want an encyclopedia of the New World Order and how it operates and what their battle plan is, this is the book.
[00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.351]  Infowarsstore.com, The Killing of Uncle Sam.
[00:51:38.191 --> 00:51:44.633]  The Killing of Uncle Sam, now available at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:51:46.493 --> 00:51:53.275]  I hope the pastor makes a book on tape of this, because most books I read, I actually listen to while driving or on the elliptical.
[00:51:54.209 --> 00:51:56.932]  I bet they're going to put it on as a book on tape because it is powerful.
[00:52:12.594 --> 00:52:14.395]  We have the best halogen out there.
[00:52:14.635 --> 00:52:16.536]  X2 is from a deep earth crystal source.
[00:52:16.636 --> 00:52:20.138]  All the other iodine is bound, meaning you don't absorb very much of it.
[00:52:20.819 --> 00:52:22.440]  People have great results with this.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.780]  It's the good halogen.
[00:52:23.841 --> 00:52:26.282]  Research the bad halogens.
[00:52:26.342 --> 00:52:27.803]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[00:52:28.183 --> 00:52:30.424]  Read the 6,000 plus reviews.
[00:52:32.966 --> 00:52:35.007]  4.8 stars.
[00:52:35.908 --> 00:52:37.729]  98% rating by Power Reviews.
[00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:39.910]  This has changed so many people's lives.
[00:52:41.556 --> 00:52:42.957]  I'm sorry, 4.9 stars.
[00:52:43.017 --> 00:52:46.260]  I was looking at this and said 4.8.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:46.960]  4.9, excuse me.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.642]  Nobody's got that on Power Reviews.
[00:52:49.662 --> 00:52:56.407]  In fact, BuzzFeed did an investigation, went to this group, and said, we want to see the internals.
[00:52:56.447 --> 00:52:58.769]  They showed them, and they couldn't believe it.
[00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.671]  Yes, it is amazing.
[00:53:02.091 --> 00:53:05.934]  And when you don't have the good halogen, folks, the bad halogens get into your glands.
[00:53:05.974 --> 00:53:07.615]  It totally changes your whole system.
[00:53:08.096 --> 00:53:09.057]  Experience it for yourself.
[00:53:09.077 --> 00:53:10.718]  A lot of people detox in about three weeks.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.740]  So, be careful when you're on it.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.401]  I would take it slow, take about a half dose the first month or so.
[00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:20.902]  It made me lazy, though, because I used to work out really hard and weigh 30, 40 more pounds.
[00:53:21.463 --> 00:53:30.745]  As soon as I went on this, I don't have to work out as much anymore, and I don't get fat, even though I'm older, just because of what it did to my whole system, my whole metabolic system.
[00:53:31.386 --> 00:53:33.226]  My skin, everything got healthier.
[00:53:33.646 --> 00:53:34.627]  My hair got healthier.
[00:53:35.127 --> 00:53:37.347]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:53:39.648 --> 00:53:44.931]  X2 is on sale right now, 25% off, even though we've only got one run of it left.
[00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:46.031]  We've done two half runs.
[00:53:46.451 --> 00:53:50.213]  We still haven't gotten more of the Deep Earth Crystals from the gas drilling companies.
[00:53:50.754 --> 00:53:52.775]  They're trying to put us over a barrel to get more of it.
[00:53:52.835 --> 00:53:56.957]  I'm looking for other sources, but it may be sold out for a while, so stock up today.
[00:53:57.637 --> 00:53:59.198]  BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:53:59.978 --> 00:54:01.699]  It is 95% curcumin.
[00:54:02.099 --> 00:54:03.420]  Nobody else we know of has that.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:04.900]  It, again, is 50% off.
[00:54:07.099 --> 00:54:10.661]  Toothpaste is 50% off, fluoride free, 4 to 5 with coiled silver and iodine.
[00:54:10.962 --> 00:54:11.842]  That's about to sell out.
[00:54:11.862 --> 00:54:12.883]  We're about to stop that sale.
[00:54:13.143 --> 00:54:16.285]  And several other sales are about to stop next Monday.
[00:54:16.565 --> 00:54:17.846]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:18.687]  Take advantage of it.
[00:54:20.428 --> 00:54:22.589]  And again, those of you that are financially supporting us,
[00:54:23.533 --> 00:54:29.615]  You're breaking the back of the globalists and Soros and Hillary and all their garbage and their lawsuits and Google trying to delist us.
[00:54:29.935 --> 00:54:36.897]  You are overpowering them when you share the links, the articles, person-to-person, mouth-to-mouth, ear-to-ear.
[00:54:37.057 --> 00:54:42.139]  You are breaking their attempt to have an iron curtain come down across this country.
[00:54:42.499 --> 00:54:43.799]  But they are pressing hard.
[00:54:44.039 --> 00:54:48.921]  It's a very dangerous game because it's exposing their tyranny to everyone.
[00:54:50.293 --> 00:54:55.115]  It's showing just how authoritarian they are, and Trump is beginning to move against them.
[00:54:56.236 --> 00:54:58.477]  But we've got to keep him in there to do that, and he's got to know.
[00:54:58.957 --> 00:55:07.140]  They're shutting down the grassroots that is 90% of Trump's power ahead of the midterms.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.743]  They are coming, not just for Trump, but for the First Amendment now, and I cannot raise the alarm enough.
[00:55:14.414 --> 00:55:17.596]  They think you're just going to incrementally censor and you're going to get sick of hearing about it and just go to sleep.
[00:55:17.717 --> 00:55:19.358]  Folks, they've been persecuting the churches.
[00:55:19.378 --> 00:55:20.879]  They've been persecuting the veterans groups.
[00:55:21.099 --> 00:55:23.001]  They've been persecuting anybody that's a patriot.
[00:55:23.241 --> 00:55:24.742]  And now they're going to the next level.
[00:55:24.782 --> 00:55:27.804]  We can't roll over to this intimidation or we'll lose everything!
[00:55:31.167 --> 00:55:31.467]  All right.
[00:55:34.429 --> 00:55:38.653]  Let me mention some really important news as we got a break here.
[00:55:41.877 --> 00:55:45.120]  This is a report out of the World Mercury Project.
[00:55:46.001 --> 00:55:53.887]  It links through to major studies in Sweden and mainstream news articles out of Europe.
[00:55:54.488 --> 00:56:00.573]  This all came out during the trials 12 years ago where there were deaths, cervical cancer, autoimmune diseases.
[00:56:01.154 --> 00:56:03.135]  The insert admits that it can kill you.
[00:56:04.073 --> 00:56:09.478]  And that it does not protect you from the thousands of strains of HPV that only kill about 4,000 people a year.
[00:56:09.818 --> 00:56:15.544]  But since they started giving the Gardasil shot in North America, guess what happened to deaths from cervical cancer?
[00:56:15.784 --> 00:56:19.127]  They've tripled to well over 12,000 a year.
[00:56:22.754 --> 00:56:38.386]  Gardasil could not get approved by the FDA, but they had a governor declare an emergency and say that he wanted it given, which then kicked in vaccine preparedness and kicked in COG and the Vaccine Damage Fund federally, and so Merck put it on the market.
[00:56:39.407 --> 00:56:41.188]  And now it's on Infowars.com.
[00:56:41.328 --> 00:56:50.115]  Please get the article and email it to every parent you know, especially that has young children, because now they're pushing it on boys in school.
[00:56:51.713 --> 00:56:53.835]  It is a live cancer virus.
[00:56:55.117 --> 00:56:59.801]  Now, technically, it hasn't been attenuated the classical sense.
[00:57:00.162 --> 00:57:05.027]  They claim it's still attenuated, but it's genetically engineered, so the attenuation doesn't work.
[00:57:06.459 --> 00:57:07.600]  It's very sophisticated.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:11.422]  HPV vaccine linked to spike in cervical cancer.
[00:57:12.002 --> 00:57:12.562]  When the U.S.
[00:57:12.602 --> 00:57:20.767]  introduced the human papillomavirus in 2006, it had been steadily declining for several decades, and then it goes in to say it's now gone up.
[00:57:21.227 --> 00:57:28.611]  A similar trend also underway in Europe, including Scandinavia, with the region of Sweden stood out as having the lowest levels of cervical cancer.
[00:57:29.662 --> 00:57:39.110]  Now that they have been given it, cervical cancer is up and it gets into all the other diseases and problems and the autoimmune problems it causes.
[00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:40.751]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[00:57:41.252 --> 00:57:45.255]  So we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, but beware these vaccines.
[00:57:45.315 --> 00:57:49.178]  I'm not saying the science of vaccines isn't real, but it's what they put in these.
[00:57:49.518 --> 00:57:50.959]  It's population control.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:51.820]  We'll be back.
[00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:45.253]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[00:58:45.273 --> 00:58:51.799]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:53.861]  These signals being sent through time
[00:59:06.539 --> 00:59:08.499]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:59:09.079 --> 00:59:12.240]  Our signal has reached more than 2 billion people.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:18.321]  But the enemy is now aware of the fact that we've broken through and are moving to block us on every front.
[00:59:18.941 --> 00:59:27.763]  The only way you're going to be able to see our videos and articles is to visit InfoWars.com itself and hand-share the videos and articles to everyone you know.
[00:59:28.343 --> 00:59:33.624]  The signal is getting through and is exposing and defeating the globalists when we're able to get it through.
[00:59:34.204 --> 00:59:39.527]  But they're admittedly expanding their operations to suppress us, so only you can boost the signal.
[00:59:40.127 --> 00:59:42.168]  Only you can defeat the Globalist.
[00:59:42.428 --> 00:59:43.328]  We're in this together.
[00:59:43.348 --> 00:59:47.410]  I salute you for your work, and I ask all of you to redouble your efforts.
[00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:52.673]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:59:56.195 --> 01:00:00.096]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:21.383 --> 01:00:22.984]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.284 --> 01:00:32.029]  The next two hours after this quick break, we're going to have the author of The Killing of Uncle Sam, Rodney Howard Brown, co-author with Paul L. Williams, in studio.
[01:00:32.049 --> 01:00:33.050]  It's going to be powerful.
[01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:34.271]  We're going to cover the waterfront.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.002]  Giuliani has come out and said, we have Mueller.
[01:00:38.022 --> 01:00:39.603]  We've totally caught him doing illegal stuff.
[01:00:39.884 --> 01:00:41.926]  If he wants to keep pushing, we'll totally tear him apart.
[01:00:42.466 --> 01:00:43.207]  They're not going to give up.
[01:00:43.387 --> 01:00:44.268]  Start tearing him apart.
[01:00:45.629 --> 01:00:46.630]  That's all coming up.
[01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:48.872]  But first, Turkey calls for World War III.
[01:00:49.232 --> 01:00:50.913]  I told people this on Tuesday.
[01:00:51.594 --> 01:00:53.836]  On Wednesday, they came out and openly said it in the U.S.
[01:00:53.876 --> 01:00:54.216]  papers.
[01:00:54.497 --> 01:00:55.417]  This is unprecedented.
[01:00:55.658 --> 01:00:56.879]  Here is that special report.
[01:00:57.395 --> 01:01:02.558]  Turkey's President Erdogan is emerging as a true tyrant that could launch World War III.
[01:01:02.858 --> 01:01:14.425]  Last year, as the Daily Mail reported, Turkey's Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu, threatened to blow the mind of Europe by sending 15,000 refugees a month to EU territory.
[01:01:14.605 --> 01:01:22.251]  This after the landmark deal signed by Ankara in Brussels that had substantially lessened the flow of migrants from Turkey to Europe.
[01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:32.718]  And they have set up political parties inside Europe that even Germany has outlawed because you've got some countries that are 10, 15, 20 percent Muslim.
[01:01:33.078 --> 01:01:38.602]  Turkey then organizes them to vote as the Turkish dictator tells them to.
[01:01:40.243 --> 01:01:40.924]  So it's amazing.
[01:01:43.809 --> 01:01:49.692]  And now they threatened last year and this year to quote, burn down Europe.
[01:01:52.133 --> 01:02:00.797]  If they didn't do what Erdogan said, Erdogan, and then if they didn't let more refugees in so they'd have a bigger voting bloc, let more of us in.
[01:02:03.934 --> 01:02:11.423]  Let the Turkish government direct these groups or we'll flood you with more people and order them to burn Europe down.
[01:02:11.744 --> 01:02:16.930]  Those are statements from his deputy minister from the Turkish government.
[01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:18.912]  Turkey is going the way of radical Islam.
[01:02:19.193 --> 01:02:21.095]  What is the current situation in Turkey?
[01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:23.238]  There's something which I call the gravity of Mohammed.
[01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:29.242]  People may move, Muslims may move away from Mohammed, but ultimately they'll be pulled back into his orbit.
[01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:43.344]  Historically, Ataturk tried to suppress what we would call Islam by various and sundry methods, one of which is to put in the army as a military, as a counterbalance to the Imams.
[01:02:44.104 --> 01:02:46.045]  Well, Ataturk is now formally dead.
[01:02:47.985 --> 01:02:52.766]  Erdogan has really finished off Ataturk, and he wants to bring forth Turkey as a
[01:02:53.757 --> 01:02:57.860]  Basically, not a Western nation, but as an Islamic nation.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:04.524]  One of the mistakes you make in dealing with Islam and its demands is to think, well, if we give them this, they'll be happy and satisfied.
[01:03:04.544 --> 01:03:09.847]  I mean, Muhammad was never satisfied until all submitted to Islam.
[01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:26.254]  Erdogan's advisor, Yigit Bulut, recently threatened the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, saying Turkey would break the arms and legs of any officers of the Prime Minister or of any minister who dares to step into EMEA in the Aegean.
[01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:37.943]  Express UK reported back in March of 2018 the Turkish state's media mouthpiece, Yeni Safak, had suggested forming a joint army to simultaneously attack Israel from all sides.
[01:03:38.123 --> 01:03:46.646]  Yenisef Fox suggested, if the member states of the OIC unite militarily, they will form the world's largest and most comprehensive army.
[01:03:46.767 --> 01:03:54.550]  And now, Erdogan has booted the Israeli ambassador out of Turkey after labeling the recent clash on the Gaza border, genocide.
[01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:57.371]  The violence a result of a protest of the U.S.
[01:03:57.431 --> 01:04:03.453]  Embassy moving to Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli troops that left thousands wounded and 62 dead.
[01:04:05.194 --> 01:04:18.118]  And now that his little precious caliphate is in trouble, Erdogan, this lunatic maniac, who had a bunch of his security people beat up Christians, protesting at their embassy in D.C.
[01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:27.361]  Oh, you're a couple hundred Christians, Armenians, protesting Turkey's ongoing abuse of Christians and others.
[01:04:27.681 --> 01:04:28.922]  You're across the street at a park?
[01:04:29.302 --> 01:04:29.942]  Here, let's let
[01:04:31.412 --> 01:04:38.156]  50 security guys come across and beat you up and even hit police and then the charges were all dropped on them last time I checked.
[01:04:38.377 --> 01:04:44.620]  And right this very minute, Americans are being held captive as political bargaining chips in Turkish prisons.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:51.004]  Fortunately, Erdogan's threats add up to arrogant bluster as Turkey's economy is running on fumes.
[01:04:51.204 --> 01:04:55.147]  The Turkish lira ranks as one of the worst currencies this year.
[01:04:55.387 --> 01:04:58.569]  And over a million Turks have taken to social media saying
[01:04:58.709 --> 01:05:02.572]  Enough, meaning Erdogan should step down immediately.
[01:05:04.373 --> 01:05:11.599]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[01:06:11.031 --> 01:06:19.268]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:25.117 --> 01:06:26.417]  The killing of Uncle Sam.
[01:06:26.477 --> 01:06:27.778]  I just read it a few weeks ago.
[01:06:28.298 --> 01:06:31.399]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, one of the bravest preachers in the world.
[01:06:31.839 --> 01:06:37.220]  Of course, he's an American, but he grew up in South Africa, and we're just really, really pleased to have him.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.240]  The demise of the United States of America.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.921]  Now, he gave us 500 books.
[01:06:40.961 --> 01:06:41.921]  I've ordered a thousand more.
[01:06:41.941 --> 01:06:42.721]  They're coming in next week.
[01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:45.422]  It starts shipping next Tuesday, but he does have
[01:06:46.022 --> 01:06:48.763]  I don't care where you get them, just be sure and get them.
[01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:14.014]  And I've read, I've read Carol Quigley's book, I've read, you know, from the globalist's own perspective, and I'm telling you, this is the book to read.
[01:07:14.354 --> 01:07:20.978]  This is fast-paced, it's thick, it's condensed, but if you want a PhD in the New World Order, this is the book.
[01:07:21.158 --> 01:07:22.999]  You have really put out a masterpiece, Pastor.
[01:07:23.769 --> 01:07:25.110]  Well, let me tell you how it happened.
[01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.910]  Hey, great to be here.
[01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:27.931]  Let me tell you how it happened.
[01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:39.876]  You know, when I was looking at the situation in America, and I was concerned because I could see that we were heading for another situation whereby they were going to push another Bush or another Clinton.
[01:07:40.276 --> 01:07:43.898]  So many people actually have no clue what's taking place.
[01:07:43.978 --> 01:07:46.639]  They think that it's a Republican or Democratic thing.
[01:07:46.699 --> 01:07:47.079]  It's not.
[01:07:47.419 --> 01:07:50.041]  This whole thing's been cooked a long time ago.
[01:07:50.341 --> 01:07:52.982]  A Republican and Democrat are two heads of the same snake.
[01:07:53.462 --> 01:07:58.827]  So, I was so frustrated about it because, you know, we came to America as missionaries.
[01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:02.650]  My wife and I came here 30 years ago with $300, landed in America.
[01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:04.952]  And then, of course, we became an American.
[01:08:05.192 --> 01:08:09.776]  We had to raise our hands to pledge to defend the Constitution against enemies, foreign or domestic.
[01:08:10.356 --> 01:08:19.961]  And here we are watching politicians that also raised their hand to pledge to defend the Constitution, selling America out for pennies on the dollar, which I couldn't even understand.
[01:08:20.461 --> 01:08:27.405]  So I felt, when I was looking at this, and we have all the politicians come around the church, you know how they are, they want to all address the congregation.
[01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:33.608]  I even had one guy, he was running for Congress, and we tell him, if you come to church you're going to sit in the service.
[01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:38.492]  And we, I don't have a 90 hour service, a 90 minute, we have a three hour plus service.
[01:08:38.592 --> 01:08:39.273]  I'm from Africa.
[01:08:39.793 --> 01:08:42.496]  And so I said, you come to my church, you're staying for the whole thing.
[01:08:42.776 --> 01:08:43.557]  He said, I'm busy.
[01:08:43.797 --> 01:08:45.959]  I said, I don't care how busy you are, you're going to stay the whole thing.
[01:08:46.259 --> 01:08:48.941]  And if you leave halfway through, I'll denounce you publicly.
[01:08:49.001 --> 01:08:50.743]  I'll tell him, don't vote for that guy.
[01:08:51.103 --> 01:08:52.064]  He's a con man.
[01:08:52.504 --> 01:08:53.806]  So we had a service.
[01:08:54.346 --> 01:09:01.370]  And the guy is in the service, and he starts leaving, and I went like this to one of my guys, I went and got him, said, Pastor said, you better get your butt back in the service.
[01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:02.210]  He said, you kidding me?
[01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:02.931]  I said, no.
[01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:07.873]  So he came in, when I gave the altar call, he was the first guy up to come and give his life to the Lord, you know.
[01:09:08.233 --> 01:09:11.135]  So anyway, so we, we, I'm a radical, you know.
[01:09:11.415 --> 01:09:13.716]  I give away AR-15s on a Sunday morning.
[01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:14.717]  So, um,
[01:09:15.942 --> 01:09:18.484]  But I felt that we had to go do something.
[01:09:18.824 --> 01:09:22.286]  So we went to Constitution Hall, right by the White House.
[01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:24.748]  Constitution Hall is a historical building.
[01:09:25.248 --> 01:09:27.370]  I wanted to get as close to the White House as I could.
[01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:31.012]  And, you know, of course, Obama is there, and, you know, years of
[01:09:31.272 --> 01:09:36.736]  I didn't agree with anything that he was doing because we come from South Africa, so we've already seen the game that's been played.
[01:09:37.257 --> 01:09:39.758]  South Africa's sitting right now on the brink of a civil war.
[01:09:40.179 --> 01:09:45.803]  If we don't see a miracle, because it's socialism, it's total communism that's just taken root in every way.
[01:09:46.203 --> 01:09:49.045]  Now to land grabs, they've got everybody killing each other.
[01:09:49.065 --> 01:09:51.867]  So, but that's another story that I want to discuss now.
[01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.689]  I wanted to cover that next hour.
[01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:54.389]  That was on my list.
[01:09:54.429 --> 01:09:55.190]  I'm glad you raised that.
[01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:56.050]  Yeah.
[01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.971]  So when I saw this, I thought, I have to do something.
[01:09:59.231 --> 01:10:02.511]  So I said, what can I do to get as close to the White House as possible?
[01:10:02.551 --> 01:10:05.032]  So we rented Constitution Hall for 15 nights.
[01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:12.853]  And I went and I stood up and exposed everything from the private central bank to the way that America is being run.
[01:10:13.134 --> 01:10:17.114]  But what I'd done leading up to it, I walked every office of the Congress and the Senate.
[01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:19.175]  It took me eight weeks to do.
[01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:20.215]  I took this book,
[01:10:20.635 --> 01:10:29.600]  Which recalls seeing Jesus as he really is, because people think that Jesus is some kind of little barefoot with a lamb on his arm speaking Elizabethan English.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.460]  That's not Jesus.
[01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:35.523]  Because he took whips and beat the bankers of the day, and turned over their tables.
[01:10:35.863 --> 01:10:39.905]  Jesus was not a skinny-jeans, soy latte-drinking pastor.
[01:10:40.146 --> 01:10:43.007]  Let me tell you, people don't even read the Bible.
[01:10:43.067 --> 01:10:44.808]  Then they say, well, Jesus wouldn't do that.
[01:10:45.128 --> 01:10:45.989]  Go read the Bible.
[01:10:46.069 --> 01:10:46.669]  He did do that.
[01:10:46.969 --> 01:10:48.030]  So I took that book,
[01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:57.594]  And I took this book, which is the reality of life after death, heaven and hell, and we printed 50,000 copies of each, and we stuck this in every office of the Congress and the Senate.
[01:10:57.914 --> 01:11:08.039]  Because I didn't know, you know, I'm desperate, I can't, I don't know what we're going to see, what are we going to have, another Bush, another Clinton, which they are friends, they've been household friends, the Clintons and the Bushes have been friends.
[01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:15.743]  When I was in the back room, they brought, this is 94, I'm in the back room getting ready to bring a 94-year-old little lady, she's been on the Hill
[01:11:16.623 --> 01:11:24.626]  Her husband was in Congress in the 60s and so she's on a walk and I thought now Apparently they said she worked for Bush senior.
[01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:28.068]  So I thought okay Rodney shut up.
[01:11:28.128 --> 01:11:32.870]  Do not mention the Bush's don't you know, don't hurt the little lady So she's sitting there.
[01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:34.630]  So I'm quiet and she looks at me.
[01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:35.711]  She goes the Bush's
[01:11:36.468 --> 01:11:37.208]  I said, yes ma'am.
[01:11:38.029 --> 01:11:39.829]  Oh, wicked people, she says.
[01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:42.550]  I said, Ruth, how can you say that?
[01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:45.291]  She's like, you know, plain dumb, you know.
[01:11:45.532 --> 01:11:47.652]  She said, they worship an owl.
[01:11:48.113 --> 01:11:50.954]  And she started talking about Bohemian Grove, you know, which you exposed.
[01:11:52.234 --> 01:11:53.975]  Anyway, so I expose all this stuff.
[01:11:54.075 --> 01:12:02.477]  One night after the service, a huge 6'4 African American gentleman come to me, put out his hand, very, you know, surly, shook my hand.
[01:12:02.737 --> 01:12:05.398]  He said, I work for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.
[01:12:05.638 --> 01:12:06.718]  And I burst out laughing.
[01:12:07.158 --> 01:12:09.559]  And then he said, everything you're saying is true.
[01:12:10.319 --> 01:12:28.876]  You know so and then so right after another one of the services dr. Paul Williams came to me he is a former FBI in actual fact he uncovered all the ISIS bases in America that the CIA have built to train ISIS to ship them to the areas of the planet that they need to create problems because if you ever
[01:12:29.036 --> 01:12:31.277]  And by the way, you talked about that years ago, others did.
[01:12:31.697 --> 01:12:33.658]  Now Fox News, it's all confirmed.
[01:12:33.678 --> 01:12:43.443]  The witnesses have come forward of Obama and Hillary shipping hundreds of aircraft with heavy weapons, anti-aircraft rockets, anti-tank tow missiles to them.
[01:12:43.483 --> 01:12:43.883]  They did it!
[01:12:44.203 --> 01:12:47.825]  But the Bushes will also complicity a lot of the stuff, and the Clintons.
[01:12:47.865 --> 01:12:49.326]  So the whole thing is a cabal.
[01:12:49.746 --> 01:12:53.508]  When Nelson Mandela died, Air Force One goes to the funeral.
[01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:55.409]  In South Africa, guess who's on board?
[01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:57.510]  The Bushes, the Clintons, and the Obamas.
[01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:58.170]  It's like a club!
[01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:00.571]  It's pally-pally.
[01:13:00.591 --> 01:13:02.552]  The American people actually think there's a difference.
[01:13:02.572 --> 01:13:03.393]  There is no difference.
[01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:06.414]  So, Dr. Williams said, I've never heard a preacher talk like you.
[01:13:06.434 --> 01:13:08.495]  He said, I'm a writer, I'm a scribe.
[01:13:08.815 --> 01:13:10.876]  He said, we need to sit down and document all of this.
[01:13:11.217 --> 01:13:15.619]  So we spent many hours from 2014 documenting everything.
[01:13:15.919 --> 01:13:17.260]  We could have come out in January.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.900]  I felt to hold it off till now.
[01:13:19.181 --> 01:13:20.721]  May 22nd is going to be released.
[01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.462]  You can order through InfoWars.
[01:13:23.863 --> 01:13:27.485]  The actual book and then the audio book, which you're going to get next week.
[01:13:28.245 --> 01:13:31.727]  It'll be available on Kindle and every place that you're able to get books.
[01:13:31.787 --> 01:13:38.850]  What I'm trying to do is to run this thing into airports, into... I know Barnes & Noble's working with us, which, that's great.
[01:13:39.011 --> 01:13:41.992]  Well, it's a beautiful cover, but it was good enough to make me read it.
[01:13:42.212 --> 01:13:43.473]  Plus, I respect you, and it's just...
[01:13:44.173 --> 01:13:50.516]  I already have researched all this, so I know it's very accurate, but then there were lots of little things I didn't know that added to it, and I went and looked it up, and it was all accurate.
[01:13:50.536 --> 01:13:53.118]  So, I learned a lot, and again, there's so much history.
[01:13:53.278 --> 01:13:55.259]  It's a thick book, but it's a lot of little chapters.
[01:13:55.519 --> 01:13:56.519]  It moves very, very fast.
[01:13:56.579 --> 01:13:59.021]  And what we did was, basically, we stayed with the money.
[01:13:59.181 --> 01:14:03.303]  Because there were many things, you know how when you go down this trail, there are many rabbit trails.
[01:14:03.863 --> 01:14:08.127]  So, basically what we decided to do was to keep it staying around the money.
[01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:09.968]  What's the problem in America?
[01:14:10.068 --> 01:14:11.830]  Why is America in the condition it's in?
[01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:19.456]  Why is it that we vote people into office every four years as a change, and yet we still keep going down the toilet?
[01:14:19.836 --> 01:14:21.938]  Is it just, oh well, it's just politics?
[01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.440]  That's a bunch of garbage!
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.841]  Total garbage!
[01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:29.324]  And if you believe that, then you're smoking some of the bad legalized weed that they've already made available.
[01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:30.385]  And you take the entire
[01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:38.229]  British Empire model, which then was picked up by the corporatist to establish this new world government, and it's all in their own words.
[01:14:38.309 --> 01:14:43.272]  This is a real plan we're breaking down, and the book The Killing of Uncle Sam lays it out.
[01:14:44.452 --> 01:14:49.574]  Because there's a thousand footnotes, the bibliography is 15 pages long, this is all documented.
[01:14:49.594 --> 01:14:55.437]  We're actually going to build a website where we actually put video clips of the actual people saying what they're saying.
[01:14:55.537 --> 01:14:58.999]  So we're not making people say, oh that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:15:00.019 --> 01:15:02.300]  A conspiracy is a secret plot to do.
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.501]  A theory is when you think there's one.
[01:15:05.441 --> 01:15:06.741]  But conspiracy fact.
[01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:08.122]  This is conspiracy fact.
[01:15:08.182 --> 01:15:08.742]  This is not theory.
[01:15:08.762 --> 01:15:09.822]  And there's one thing they fear.
[01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:13.563]  It's getting people to understand there's a conspiracy just like Mueller against Trump.
[01:15:13.924 --> 01:15:15.444]  And now it's all been confirmed.
[01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:17.025]  But they were so dumb.
[01:15:17.065 --> 01:15:18.985]  They bragged when he was president-elect.
[01:15:19.065 --> 01:15:19.805]  Oh, we spied on him.
[01:15:19.825 --> 01:15:20.526]  We've got the goods.
[01:15:20.826 --> 01:15:21.526]  Well, they spied.
[01:15:21.546 --> 01:15:22.326]  They didn't have the goods.
[01:15:22.566 --> 01:15:23.547]  Then they tried to pull back.
[01:15:23.647 --> 01:15:25.967]  Now they've been caught perjuring themselves to Congress.
[01:15:25.987 --> 01:15:27.208]  When we come back, we'll talk about it.
[01:15:27.968 --> 01:15:34.691]  With, again, the author of Killing of Uncle Sam, The Demise of the United States of America, Rodney Howard Brown and Paul L. Williams.
[01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:35.391]  Incredible book.
[01:15:35.711 --> 01:15:36.772]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:36.852 --> 01:15:37.572]  And tell them how to get it.
[01:15:38.212 --> 01:15:39.152]  You've got a lot of websites.
[01:15:39.172 --> 01:15:40.553]  What's the best place for them to go?
[01:15:40.593 --> 01:15:43.514]  Revival.com or KillingUncleSamBook.com.
[01:15:43.534 --> 01:15:46.035]  But I mean, I want your viewers to buy from you.
[01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:46.255]  Sure.
[01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:47.376]  Regardless, they just need to read it.
[01:15:47.396 --> 01:15:48.116]  That's what it's all about.
[01:15:48.436 --> 01:15:52.582]  And I think you ought to make a film about the killing of Uncle Sam.
[01:15:52.622 --> 01:15:53.283]  It's a great name.
[01:15:53.323 --> 01:15:53.843]  It's a great book.
[01:15:54.144 --> 01:15:59.211]  We'll be back with Mueller caught red-handed and Giuliani says they're ready to tear them apart.
[01:16:03.387 --> 01:16:07.290]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:14.815]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:20.698]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[01:16:24.141 --> 01:16:27.083]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[01:16:28.123 --> 01:16:28.864]  But he didn't give up.
[01:16:30.162 --> 01:16:30.622]  And he won.
[01:16:32.344 --> 01:16:33.765]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[01:16:34.525 --> 01:16:38.608]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given victory.
[01:16:39.849 --> 01:16:43.191]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[01:16:44.192 --> 01:16:45.092]  And they all died.
[01:16:45.333 --> 01:16:46.714]  All 180 plus men.
[01:16:48.555 --> 01:16:52.057]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[01:16:53.659 --> 01:16:57.901]  So I don't know how M4 War's fight is gonna end.
[01:16:59.022 --> 01:16:59.723]  But I know this.
[01:17:02.242 --> 01:17:22.544]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance, I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[01:17:24.025 --> 01:17:27.726]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[01:17:28.647 --> 01:17:36.190]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:48.034]  But that said, just like our information is game changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[01:17:50.495 --> 01:17:53.838]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there.
[01:17:54.839 --> 01:17:56.980]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[01:17:57.361 --> 01:17:59.583]  Or whether it's DNA force that's now back in stock.
[01:18:00.904 --> 01:18:01.104]  PQQ.
[01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:01.324]  Go Q10.
[01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:11.271]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:23.715]  They sell PQQ in little bottles with a third the dose we put in this, each chaplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like $40, $50 for a little bottle.
[01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:26.902]  Think about that.
[01:18:26.982 --> 01:18:27.822]  It's $74 right now.
[01:18:28.762 --> 01:18:33.684]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[01:18:34.725 --> 01:18:36.045]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[01:18:36.085 --> 01:18:44.429]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[01:18:44.769 --> 01:18:46.470]  So I signed a bigger contract, got a better deal.
[01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:54.496]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product So I've not gambled.
[01:18:55.076 --> 01:18:55.957]  I know you want value.
[01:18:55.997 --> 01:19:13.011]  So we've bought even more of it We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it and we've got it right now At the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere DNA force go read the five-star reviews thousands of go see what people set it in for them.
[01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:14.412]  It is dramatic and
[01:19:15.583 --> 01:19:23.347]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:32.591]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[01:19:33.131 --> 01:19:39.774]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at MFullRestore.com or you can call AAA-253-3139.
[01:19:42.589 --> 01:19:48.192]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[01:19:48.393 --> 01:19:48.853]  That's fine.
[01:19:50.294 --> 01:19:51.354]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[01:19:51.775 --> 01:19:52.475]  I'm funded by you.
[01:19:52.695 --> 01:19:53.596]  So thank you all.
[01:19:54.236 --> 01:19:59.239]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[01:19:59.779 --> 01:20:02.481]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[01:20:05.863 --> 01:20:08.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.227 --> 01:20:18.371]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:18.871 --> 01:20:24.019]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:27.834 --> 01:20:30.696]  Timeline, what is your optimal timeline for this to wrap up?
[01:20:30.837 --> 01:20:31.597]  They should do it today.
[01:20:32.478 --> 01:20:34.079]  I mean, as soon as possible.
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.502]  I think that they have the facts from which they can write their report.
[01:20:37.962 --> 01:20:39.924]  If you're gonna write a fair report, fine, write it.
[01:20:39.944 --> 01:20:42.145]  If you're gonna write an unfair report, write it.
[01:20:42.766 --> 01:20:43.727]  And we will combat it.
[01:20:43.987 --> 01:20:45.348]  We're ready to rip it apart.
[01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:48.911]  And we're ready to rip them apart, if that's what they want.
[01:20:49.771 --> 01:20:53.074]  We would rather peacefully settle this and get it over with.
[01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:55.656]  But see, there's the problem.
[01:20:56.735 --> 01:21:00.537]  Giuliani, former federal prosecutor, watched him, you know, prosecuting Clinton, all of it.
[01:21:01.297 --> 01:21:04.159]  The problem lies in that they're cornered rats.
[01:21:04.599 --> 01:21:07.361]  They have signaled no quarter given, no quarter received.
[01:21:08.081 --> 01:21:08.902]  They're going for broke.
[01:21:08.962 --> 01:21:11.643]  So he's signaling, hey, we've got you illegally spying.
[01:21:11.663 --> 01:21:12.744]  We've got you lying to Congress.
[01:21:12.984 --> 01:21:15.465]  We've got you on the tarmac with Russians, giving them uranium.
[01:21:15.685 --> 01:21:20.748]  We've got you with a very oligarch Mueller, who you say that Trump's involved with.
[01:21:20.808 --> 01:21:25.931]  I mean, they went Russia, Russia, Russia, because the Clintons were involved, up their eyeballs with Russia.
[01:21:26.471 --> 01:21:31.693]  And so now Giuliani's trying to signal to them, hey, just stop it.
[01:21:31.974 --> 01:21:32.794]  Let's have a truce.
[01:21:33.654 --> 01:21:39.377]  In my gut, but also intellectually, Pastor, I know that that is not what they're planning.
[01:21:39.497 --> 01:21:43.459]  And so here's one more clip from Giuliani again saying, if they
[01:21:44.139 --> 01:21:45.040]  Illegally spied.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.220]  They've been caught.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:47.281]  It's admitted.
[01:21:47.501 --> 01:21:53.444]  The FISA court issued a report last year and again this year saying it was illegal, that they were lied to.
[01:21:54.025 --> 01:21:58.107]  And the judges have said they lied to get these warrants and they used it for political purposes.
[01:21:58.367 --> 01:21:58.927]  It's in the news.
[01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:05.171]  New York Times today comes out and confirms FBI ran spy operation against Trump campaign that was illegal.
[01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:08.713]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, we're going to play this clip, but do you agree with me on that?
[01:22:09.173 --> 01:22:09.573]  Totally.
[01:22:09.653 --> 01:22:16.579]  I mean, what people don't understand, the narrative is being spun by the mainstream media because the media was taken over through Operation Mockingbird.
[01:22:17.119 --> 01:22:21.743]  And that whatever you see from MSN, it's propaganda.
[01:22:22.143 --> 01:22:23.985]  I mean, it doesn't matter who you're watching.
[01:22:24.365 --> 01:22:25.646]  So they're going to spin the narrative.
[01:22:25.726 --> 01:22:29.049]  People don't realize that Reuters and Associated Press were taken over.
[01:22:29.429 --> 01:22:33.753]  So they put out the AP, and then everybody just swallows that, and that's the narrative.
[01:22:34.173 --> 01:22:39.416]  That's right, there's always been some problems, but now they will flat out lie about the sky being blue.
[01:22:39.476 --> 01:22:46.060]  I mean, they will just lie and one day be saying, we've been spying on Trump and know he's a Russian, we have all the wiretaps.
[01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:50.283]  Next day, January 20th, we never did it, it's made up, it's insane.
[01:22:50.543 --> 01:22:52.665]  In December of 2016, I was in the Ukraine.
[01:22:56.887 --> 01:23:09.471]  And, anyway, so while I was in the Ukraine, through the church, it's a huge church of thousands of people, and there were people from the government there, and they said, look, will I meet with the future ambassador of the United States?
[01:23:09.531 --> 01:23:10.091]  I said, sure.
[01:23:10.111 --> 01:23:16.273]  So he come to my hotel, and he said to me, look, he brought me this document and said, would you give this to Trump's administration?
[01:23:16.313 --> 01:23:16.893]  I said, for what?
[01:23:17.233 --> 01:23:20.854]  They said, we want to apologize for backing Hillary.
[01:23:21.234 --> 01:23:22.834]  He said, we supported Hillary.
[01:23:22.854 --> 01:23:24.235]  So I knew that in December,
[01:23:25.116 --> 01:23:25.977]  Of 2016.
[01:23:26.358 --> 01:23:36.857]  So I brought that back and of course got it through the channels, which I'm not sure if it got anywhere, but this was all the Ukrainian government apologizing for the way that they backed Hillary over Trump.
[01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:38.820]  And they realize they're in trouble now.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:43.444]  And of course it's come out now that they were running a big election operation illegally against Trump.
[01:23:43.744 --> 01:23:44.145]  Totally.
[01:23:44.485 --> 01:23:51.631]  So you got the subversive stuff going on and basically doing whatever they can to stop the President, which they couldn't.
[01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:54.954]  Two billion dollars worth of media against him, couldn't stop him.
[01:23:55.194 --> 01:23:56.495]  The Republicans were against him.
[01:23:56.515 --> 01:23:59.518]  You know, that's why I laugh when I hear Republicans are upset with Trump.
[01:23:59.538 --> 01:24:01.059]  They were always upset with Trump.
[01:24:01.079 --> 01:24:05.223]  They didn't want Trump to become... This is... I feel in my gut, but also historically,
[01:24:05.663 --> 01:24:10.209]  And you see this biblically, God gives people one last chance, and to turn it around.
[01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:14.174]  So people think, oh, it's Providence, he's divinely inspired, you know, he can't be stopped.
[01:24:14.274 --> 01:24:14.855]  I don't agree with that.
[01:24:14.895 --> 01:24:22.445]  I think if we don't back Trump, if we aren't strong, if we don't pray, if we're not active, if we're not courageous, I think God will step aside and let this whole thing fall.
[01:24:22.645 --> 01:24:24.086]  This is a last minute reprieve.
[01:24:24.146 --> 01:24:30.552]  In actual fact, Dr. Paul Williams, when we were writing this, he said, I want the last chapter to be called The Reign of Jezebel.
[01:24:30.913 --> 01:24:33.295]  And I looked at him and said, absolutely not.
[01:24:33.816 --> 01:24:34.516]  Absolutely not.
[01:24:34.576 --> 01:24:35.497]  She's not getting in.
[01:24:35.857 --> 01:24:38.540]  He said, she, she, there's no way she's not going to win.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:40.922]  I said, she is not going to get in.
[01:24:41.303 --> 01:24:44.926]  We've had all-night premiums at the church, you know, and I didn't support Trump.
[01:24:45.006 --> 01:24:45.887]  I knew Trump was going to win.
[01:24:46.127 --> 01:24:50.793]  Yeah, I didn't support him as a Republican or Democrat because both Republican and Democrat are wicked.
[01:24:50.913 --> 01:24:55.599]  I supported him because he was an outsider and was not funded by the globalists to come.
[01:24:55.699 --> 01:24:58.343]  And you could see that genuinely the globalists hate him.
[01:24:59.119 --> 01:24:59.499]  In a way.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:00.881]  The Pope is against him.
[01:25:01.261 --> 01:25:03.903]  The world's financial elite and offices against him.
[01:25:04.223 --> 01:25:08.647]  The former Mexican president is against him.
[01:25:08.927 --> 01:25:12.630]  Everybody said, OK, well, that tells you who he's supposed to support right there.
[01:25:12.931 --> 01:25:14.612]  Hollywood, all of it.
[01:25:14.692 --> 01:25:16.373]  They are just what are they going to do?
[01:25:16.393 --> 01:25:18.035]  You know why Hollywood was against them?
[01:25:18.415 --> 01:25:20.397]  Because what happened in Europe?
[01:25:20.877 --> 01:25:29.884]  The EU had voted to fund all of the EU's, all the film industry, through the EU, through, you know, whatever they have there, their system of the money.
[01:25:30.385 --> 01:25:37.730]  And Trump had already, that bill was already passed by the House to allow Hollywood to be supported by the taxpaying Americans.
[01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:39.272]  And Trump went in and nixed it.
[01:25:39.332 --> 01:25:43.034]  That's why Hollywood daily harasses the President.
[01:25:43.074 --> 01:25:43.575]  And guess what?
[01:25:43.855 --> 01:25:44.496]  It's failing them.
[01:25:44.736 --> 01:25:45.797]  Nobody even watches them.
[01:25:46.137 --> 01:25:47.498]  You know, CNN, out of 25 networks,
[01:25:49.199 --> 01:25:51.041]  In the cable news now, let me expand on that.
[01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:57.266]  Number 24, behind the FX, which is the science fiction channel, and right off the American movie classics.
[01:25:57.886 --> 01:25:58.226]  Duh!
[01:25:58.847 --> 01:26:02.430]  Reruns of Yogi Bear is higher than CNN.
[01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:03.711]  Who wants to watch it?
[01:26:04.171 --> 01:26:05.052]  Well, expand it.
[01:26:05.112 --> 01:26:10.256]  And Acosta actually, Acosta said today, he said, if the President would only let me interview him.
[01:26:10.596 --> 01:26:12.198]  Who does he even think he is?
[01:26:12.578 --> 01:26:17.542]  He shouldn't even be reporting for a special Pets Monthly broadcast.
[01:26:17.662 --> 01:26:19.983]  Acosta's been caught lying over and over again.
[01:26:20.003 --> 01:26:22.805]  Oh, there's no Martin Luther King bus in the White House.
[01:26:23.005 --> 01:26:25.747]  Oh, he didn't go, Trump didn't visit Scalise.
[01:26:26.087 --> 01:26:27.868]  He just, he's an incessant liar.
[01:26:28.188 --> 01:26:35.712]  The whole time, the whole narrative is almost like that the media cannot stop for lying because they so hate the president.
[01:26:36.092 --> 01:26:36.473]  They hate him.
[01:26:37.321 --> 01:26:40.262]  So they can't, they're gonna, no matter what he does, they're gonna lie about it.
[01:26:40.382 --> 01:26:47.365]  And so, you can see, you know, I saw somebody else said today that, you know, it looks like Trump is undermining the justice.
[01:26:47.545 --> 01:26:51.247]  The justice system was undermined years ago, read the book, read the book.
[01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:54.108]  The justice system was done away with years ago.
[01:26:54.448 --> 01:26:56.369]  Everything's been compromised from
[01:26:56.889 --> 01:26:59.311]  Here's the thing Alex, that's the biggest problem.
[01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:00.112]  People don't understand.
[01:27:00.172 --> 01:27:03.615]  We talk about how they took schooling and they standardized it.
[01:27:03.975 --> 01:27:06.397]  And they basically dumbed everybody down.
[01:27:06.797 --> 01:27:11.842]  So even the universities now, I mean look at the leftist professors.
[01:27:12.302 --> 01:27:13.483]  And everything pumping.
[01:27:13.743 --> 01:27:16.205]  That's why you've got these rioting on university campuses.
[01:27:16.225 --> 01:27:19.327]  Because you've got students that don't even know what the truth is anymore.
[01:27:19.347 --> 01:27:20.148]  They have no clue.
[01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:21.449]  They don't even know history.
[01:27:21.849 --> 01:27:27.793]  And so, then they took over the seminaries through FOSDIC, funded by Rockefeller.
[01:27:28.213 --> 01:27:30.335]  And that's the funding for Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
[01:27:30.355 --> 01:27:32.576]  You know, everybody talks about accreditation.
[01:27:32.656 --> 01:27:34.398]  Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are not accredited.
[01:27:34.918 --> 01:27:36.659]  Who's going to question Harvard, Yale, and Princeton?
[01:27:36.899 --> 01:27:40.882]  But they were all evangelical Bible schools that actually raised people up to go to the mission fields.
[01:27:41.182 --> 01:27:44.204]  And when you go there, the scriptures are engraved in the marble.
[01:27:44.264 --> 01:27:45.945]  And now they're talking about tearing that out.
[01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:46.586]  Yeah.
[01:27:46.826 --> 01:27:47.506]  Because they hate it.
[01:27:47.546 --> 01:27:51.749]  They want to tell you the atheists and the Rockefellers created the country and all this, and none of it's true.
[01:27:51.889 --> 01:27:53.350]  How did their scriptures get in there?
[01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:54.771]  Even in the halls of Congress.
[01:27:55.031 --> 01:27:57.272]  The first major church was in the Capitol building.
[01:27:57.593 --> 01:28:00.915]  Washington started that, and the Marine Band did the praise and worship.
[01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:05.198]  And the daily, Congress could not open without praise and worship.
[01:28:05.498 --> 01:28:08.460]  So now we're sitting, living, you can't say anything.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.041]  Who do these people think they are?
[01:28:10.061 --> 01:28:13.423]  And by the way, it was real Christianity that gave us our providence and our power.
[01:28:13.783 --> 01:28:19.867]  And that's why the globalists want us to get rid of it, because they know it gives us that providence and that power over the world.
[01:28:19.907 --> 01:28:21.328]  They want us to give up our birthright.
[01:28:21.468 --> 01:28:31.777]  Because the first great awakening in the 1700s is what took 13 rebel colonies and put them together to make us become what America would become.
[01:28:31.797 --> 01:28:38.282]  50 states that would be 50 nations joined together by divine providence.
[01:28:38.502 --> 01:28:42.726]  There was no way we could defeat the British might if it had not been for the hand of God.
[01:28:43.286 --> 01:28:43.706]  Period!
[01:28:44.147 --> 01:28:45.948]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, going to break.
[01:28:46.208 --> 01:28:58.678]  You've got big news on the military protecting Trump, which I know inside baseball is true, but you've got an amazing angle of what you witnessed in Florida when we come back, and you know, the fights coming ahead, what's happening in South Africa, what's happening with the Democrats, and more.
[01:28:59.018 --> 01:28:59.559]  Straight ahead.
[01:29:02.081 --> 01:29:04.062]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:29:04.142 --> 01:29:04.482]  Go ahead.
[01:29:04.783 --> 01:29:06.964]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[01:29:06.984 --> 01:29:10.007]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:29:10.828 --> 01:29:11.969]  It just gets old, man.
[01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:13.971]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:29:14.672 --> 01:29:16.754]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:29:16.994 --> 01:29:20.998]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:29:21.018 --> 01:29:23.501]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:29:24.322 --> 01:29:26.644]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:29:27.004 --> 01:29:28.105]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:29:28.366 --> 01:29:29.246]  Us being shut down?
[01:29:29.487 --> 01:29:30.508]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:29:30.948 --> 01:29:31.988]  You know what, Alex?
[01:29:32.028 --> 01:29:33.109]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:29:33.129 --> 01:29:33.929]  Hey, Frank!
[01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:39.591]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:29:39.892 --> 01:29:44.173]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:47.274]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:29:47.534 --> 01:29:47.915]  You understand?
[01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.275]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:29:49.655 --> 01:29:50.776]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:29:51.756 --> 01:29:56.682]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:30:06.653 --> 01:30:07.674]  Dude, I'm not doing that.
[01:30:07.914 --> 01:30:11.358]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[01:30:11.558 --> 01:30:12.979]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[01:30:12.999 --> 01:30:13.820]  They're suing me.
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.221]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:17.524]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[01:30:17.564 --> 01:30:18.925]  We were bringing five million in a year.
[01:30:18.945 --> 01:30:20.186]  It cost a lot to run this.
[01:30:20.346 --> 01:30:22.228]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[01:30:22.469 --> 01:30:25.431]  I keep growing more as fast as I can and as fast as I cut them off.
[01:30:26.152 --> 01:30:27.213]  I'm shooting out tentacles.
[01:30:27.493 --> 01:30:29.034]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[01:30:29.054 --> 01:30:29.634]  Tell him right there.
[01:30:29.654 --> 01:30:29.955]  Frank!
[01:30:30.195 --> 01:30:30.775]  Hey, Frank!
[01:30:31.015 --> 01:30:32.276]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[01:30:32.676 --> 01:30:36.359]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention.
[01:30:36.399 --> 01:30:37.880]  Although, of course, everybody likes a little bit of attention.
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:38.260]  It's nice.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:48.807]  But I can't do TV, and I can't do radio, and I can't publish books, and I can't sell anything, and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[01:30:48.907 --> 01:30:49.508]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:30:49.568 --> 01:30:51.649]  Using every resource at their disposal.
[01:30:51.689 --> 01:30:52.910]  So it's not bragging.
[01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.891]  It's a daily reality.
[01:30:53.911 --> 01:30:55.552]  And that's why you've got to support things like Infowars and...
[01:30:56.192 --> 01:30:58.374]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[01:30:58.394 --> 01:30:58.895]  We're doing it now.
[01:30:58.995 --> 01:31:00.116]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:00.156 --> 01:31:00.897]  Go get a t-shirt.
[01:31:00.937 --> 01:31:01.277]  Get a book.
[01:31:01.537 --> 01:31:02.458]  Sign up for auto-ship.

[01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.389]  Listen.
[01:31:16.531 --> 01:31:17.653]  Everybody wants somebody to fight?
[01:31:18.174 --> 01:31:18.815]  We're fighting!
[01:31:19.075 --> 01:31:20.417]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[01:31:20.477 --> 01:31:24.744]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.
[01:31:25.064 --> 01:31:28.549]  If you make examples of us and fund us, we will be victorious and you win.
[01:31:28.569 --> 01:31:29.331]  Do you understand?
[01:31:29.351 --> 01:31:30.552]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:31:34.912 --> 01:31:36.773]  Desiree, thanks for holding your on the air from California.
[01:31:36.793 --> 01:31:37.073]  Go ahead.
[01:31:37.213 --> 01:31:41.116]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[01:31:41.236 --> 01:31:46.199]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[01:31:46.219 --> 01:31:52.122]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[01:31:53.163 --> 01:32:01.450]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[01:32:02.251 --> 01:32:04.993]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[01:32:05.674 --> 01:32:09.297]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, five days a week.
[01:32:09.397 --> 01:32:16.263]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[01:32:16.403 --> 01:32:16.683]  I'm just
[01:32:16.883 --> 01:32:21.027]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[01:32:21.447 --> 01:32:24.730]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:29.694]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[01:32:30.195 --> 01:32:35.779]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[01:32:35.839 --> 01:32:40.363]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[01:32:41.223 --> 01:32:42.524]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:48.048]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[01:32:48.068 --> 01:32:49.409]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[01:32:49.449 --> 01:32:49.569]  Yeah.
[01:32:49.729 --> 01:32:51.611]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[01:32:51.651 --> 01:32:52.471]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[01:32:52.511 --> 01:32:54.193]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[01:32:54.233 --> 01:32:55.173]  We really appreciate you.
[01:32:55.574 --> 01:32:56.254]  Keep up the fight.
[01:32:56.294 --> 01:32:57.695]  We need to take California back.
[01:32:57.715 --> 01:32:58.075]  Thank you, Desiree.
[01:32:58.095 --> 01:32:59.196]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[01:32:59.256 --> 01:32:59.857]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[01:33:06.802 --> 01:33:09.404]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.897 --> 01:33:29.019]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:29.539 --> 01:33:35.441]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.521 --> 01:33:41.083]  We're back live.
[01:33:41.143 --> 01:33:49.686]  The Killing of Uncle Sam is the amazing book by Pastor Rodney Howard Brown and Paul L. Williams, and it really is an amazing book at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:33:50.266 --> 01:33:51.567]  But separately,
[01:33:52.711 --> 01:33:58.274]  I was told some things early on in the Trump campaign that made me begin to endorse him.
[01:33:59.175 --> 01:34:00.855]  And my gut already liked him.
[01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:07.559]  But then I talked to some of my sources, and look, let's say I have military sources or CIA sources.
[01:34:08.499 --> 01:34:12.462]  Most of the stuff we know is from the Globalist's own statements, their own documents, their own admissions.
[01:34:12.482 --> 01:34:18.525]  95% of the stuff's public, so it's not like our broadcast is based on secret sources.
[01:34:19.636 --> 01:34:30.838]  But once the Trump campaign got going on, I knew that Eric Prince was involved, and I knew that they were aware that Hillary was planning to end free speech, and they were planning to persecute Christians even worse.
[01:34:31.678 --> 01:34:39.740]  It was so bad that even people who are pretty mean said, we're not doing this just to kick America around for no reason.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:43.301]  We're not going to go ahead and just have a huge depression and let China take over.
[01:34:43.701 --> 01:34:45.441]  So America got to its deathbed.
[01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:48.162]  It got to basically its 11th hour.
[01:34:51.926 --> 01:35:03.834]  And so it was the American people elected Trump, but it was folks out of Florida, the military, and other groups that helped the American people work to get the WikiLeaks out.
[01:35:03.914 --> 01:35:14.321]  I mean it was Eric Prince, and I was told this a long time ago, but I was told just this week from several sources, go ahead and go public with it because he's involved with the whole
[01:35:15.492 --> 01:35:19.977]  Cambridge Analytica and that whole demonization, and they're going to try to come after him.
[01:35:20.318 --> 01:35:27.807]  But there were, and it's not just Eric Prince, it was a bunch of other people in intelligence agencies that knew that this was the end of America if we didn't get Trump in.
[01:35:28.468 --> 01:35:32.112]  Or at least the Democrats were going to move with the blue-blood Republicans to end it.
[01:35:33.954 --> 01:35:34.174]  That's
[01:35:54.275 --> 01:35:59.500]  Patriots separate from Trump that ran intelligence operations against Hillary because she's a foreign globalist.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.801]  It was America did that.
[01:36:00.861 --> 01:36:01.601]  America won.
[01:36:01.882 --> 01:36:03.043]  America got Trump elected.
[01:36:03.303 --> 01:36:06.406]  America gave the globalists a bloody nose and a broken jaw.
[01:36:06.866 --> 01:36:08.568]  And so now they're counter striking back.
[01:36:08.608 --> 01:36:09.288]  They're the globalists.
[01:36:09.308 --> 01:36:10.289]  They're the outside force.
[01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:11.510]  We're the Americans.
[01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:13.052]  Look at the country coming back from the dead.
[01:36:13.372 --> 01:36:14.373]  We're the ones turning it around.
[01:36:14.393 --> 01:36:15.113]  But then I was told...
[01:36:16.034 --> 01:36:22.600]  Let them try to remove Trump with their fake garbage, extrajudicial stuff, because he's got the Marines and the Army.
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:35.850]  Once he became President-elect and then President encamped around him, and I actually know that, and so if rogue FBI and rogue former intelligence heads are so arrogant, think they're gonna pull this, they're all being surveilled, they're all being watched.
[01:36:36.191 --> 01:36:37.291]  Trump has been coolly
[01:36:38.412 --> 01:36:42.534]  Letting them commit all these crimes so that once he pulls the noose, they're totally caught.
[01:36:42.794 --> 01:36:54.678]  And now Giuliani's on television saying, we'll play that clip again in a moment, you do one more thing, you don't drop this down for the betterment of the country, and you don't really run up the white flag, we're gonna tear you into pieces.
[01:36:54.718 --> 01:37:00.741]  Let's go ahead and play that clip of Giuliani saying, we're going to quote, ready to rip them apart.
[01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:01.141]  Here it is.
[01:37:02.632 --> 01:37:05.475]  Timeline, what is your optimal timeline for this to wrap up?
[01:37:05.635 --> 01:37:06.355]  They should do it today.
[01:37:06.375 --> 01:37:08.857]  I mean, as soon as possible.
[01:37:09.698 --> 01:37:12.280]  I think that they have the facts from which they can write their report.
[01:37:12.721 --> 01:37:14.722]  If you're going to write a fair report, fine, write it.
[01:37:14.742 --> 01:37:16.944]  If you're going to write an unfair report, write it.
[01:37:17.564 --> 01:37:18.505]  And we will combat it.
[01:37:18.785 --> 01:37:20.127]  We're ready to rip it apart.
[01:37:20.987 --> 01:37:23.689]  And we're ready to rip them apart, if that's what they want.
[01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:27.873]  We would rather peacefully settle this and get it over with.
[01:37:28.473 --> 01:37:29.915]  Now that, that is a ultimatum.
[01:37:30.515 --> 01:37:33.097]  From a former top federal prosecutor who almost brought down Clinton.
[01:37:33.438 --> 01:37:36.581]  He's saying, you got an ultimatum that's from the president.
[01:37:36.641 --> 01:37:38.402]  So the president has issued an ultimatum.
[01:37:38.903 --> 01:37:39.663]  That's what's happened.
[01:37:39.683 --> 01:37:41.185]  What do you say to that, Pastor?
[01:37:41.725 --> 01:37:45.448]  You know, obviously, I mean, this thing's gone on long enough now.
[01:37:45.529 --> 01:37:45.749]  I mean,
[01:37:47.050 --> 01:37:48.551]  And there's no proof of anything.
[01:37:48.652 --> 01:37:51.815]  So it's just spinning the lies and keep spinning.
[01:37:51.895 --> 01:38:00.583]  So you can see on social media the dumbed-down population of America responding to the lies of the mainstream media agreeing with it.
[01:38:01.764 --> 01:38:07.786]  I believe in the end this thing is going to become, well it's already unraveled, but it's all going to be exposed for what it is.
[01:38:08.226 --> 01:38:14.068]  Because this is what Infowars is doing, this is what you, the Infowarrior, are doing.
[01:38:14.108 --> 01:38:15.508]  You're waking up your friends.
[01:38:15.608 --> 01:38:19.149]  Don't be bashful or shy about it.
[01:38:19.209 --> 01:38:19.890]  Be vocal.
[01:38:20.170 --> 01:38:23.191]  Because if you don't speak out right now... This is the main battle, exactly.
[01:38:23.271 --> 01:38:23.931]  This is the time.
[01:38:24.591 --> 01:38:29.056]  And everybody has, your voice needs to be heard because you're going to reach people I can't reach.
[01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:30.858]  You'll reach people Alex can't reach.
[01:38:31.158 --> 01:38:33.421]  And you know when people look... That is so critical.
[01:38:33.681 --> 01:38:35.343]  Don't just say it because I just kind of throw it out there.
[01:38:35.363 --> 01:38:35.643]  It's true.
[01:38:36.044 --> 01:38:43.091]  You the individuals with the power, when you talk to people, when you spread the word about what Pastor Brown's doing or what we're doing, that overrides them.
[01:38:43.151 --> 01:38:44.493]  That's what they can't control is you.
[01:38:44.873 --> 01:38:45.153]  Correct.
[01:38:45.434 --> 01:38:50.999]  So people look at all the stuff we put in here, which is 200 years of history, they say, it's overwhelming, I can't do anything.
[01:38:51.059 --> 01:38:51.820]  But here's the thing.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:55.203]  If everyone watching says, what can I do?
[01:38:55.283 --> 01:38:58.366]  You can pray, you can ask God, give me one thing that I must do.
[01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.568]  And if everybody watching does one thing,
[01:39:01.008 --> 01:39:03.610]  You can bring about a transformation in America like that.
[01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:05.352]  We'll see a total transformation.
[01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:06.112]  There's no question.
[01:39:06.412 --> 01:39:09.255]  Two women wreaked havoc on American society.
[01:39:09.375 --> 01:39:10.436]  One took prey out of schools.
[01:39:10.716 --> 01:39:15.720]  The other one started Planned Parenthood, which has been the death of 27 million African Americans just alone.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.341]  I hear the abortion number's what?
[01:39:17.721 --> 01:39:18.382]  59 million now.
[01:39:18.422 --> 01:39:19.643]  So come on.
[01:39:19.663 --> 01:39:20.924]  42% of blacks never get out of their mama.
[01:39:21.184 --> 01:39:23.145]  So, come on, you don't hear a word!
[01:39:23.385 --> 01:39:25.967]  Did you see Spike Lee like a little demon, going, ehhh?
[01:39:26.227 --> 01:39:28.048]  I mean, how much, did you see how much he hates Trump?
[01:39:28.369 --> 01:39:30.310]  He was like, he turned into a gargoyle!
[01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:36.834]  Yeah, they all, even Keith Richards said, and what's so crazy, these are anti-gunners, he said, I'll pull out my knife, you know?
[01:39:37.574 --> 01:39:38.975]  Typical prick, you know what I mean?
[01:39:39.255 --> 01:39:41.517]  I'll pull out my knife if I get a hold of Trump.
[01:39:41.817 --> 01:39:43.338]  So these people are crazy, they're lunatics.
[01:39:43.378 --> 01:39:45.679]  And they all signal how they want to kill or hurt Trump.
[01:39:45.899 --> 01:39:46.320]  In fact, can we...
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:48.621]  Play the beeped one, of course.
[01:39:49.622 --> 01:39:50.182]  Cue Lee up.
[01:39:50.202 --> 01:39:52.244]  But it's the way he looks for radio listeners.
[01:39:52.964 --> 01:39:57.447]  He brings this violent hate out from Hollywood because it's spiritual.
[01:39:57.587 --> 01:39:59.508]  Yeah, but you didn't see us doing that with Obama.
[01:39:59.809 --> 01:39:59.989]  No.
[01:40:00.329 --> 01:40:02.110]  You didn't see us doing that with Bush.
[01:40:02.410 --> 01:40:03.831]  You didn't see us doing that with Clinton.
[01:40:04.652 --> 01:40:06.033]  We just had to sit and take it.
[01:40:06.718 --> 01:40:07.759]  But they're doing that with Trump.
[01:40:08.279 --> 01:40:10.140]  Because they know the day is finished.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.421]  They know that he's neutralizing them.
[01:40:13.041 --> 01:40:14.102]  He's castrated them.
[01:40:15.022 --> 01:40:17.824]  Since I mentioned it, well let's do it in the next segment, the whole military thing.
[01:40:17.844 --> 01:40:19.245]  Let's go ahead and do it now.
[01:40:19.285 --> 01:40:20.705]  Go ahead and get into what you witnessed in Florida.
[01:40:22.246 --> 01:40:28.208]  So I was concerned, you know, because I obviously understand how the deep state function and what's going on.
[01:40:28.808 --> 01:40:32.009]  And so I was really concerned for his safety.
[01:40:32.369 --> 01:40:36.730]  But when we had to go in on a Sunday night, I speak in West Palm Beach.
[01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:39.290]  So we landed at the West Palm Beach Airport.
[01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:40.511]  We pulled up to the FBO.
[01:40:41.451 --> 01:40:43.434]  And Air Force One had just left.
[01:40:43.534 --> 01:40:48.001]  Now, they told me if I came in before, I couldn't land in West Palm Beach.
[01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:52.748]  I had to go down to, I can't remember, I think it was Lauderdale, because it was a 30-mile
[01:40:54.008 --> 01:40:56.289]  Blocked airways around Mar-a-Lago.
[01:40:56.329 --> 01:40:57.109]  You couldn't get there.
[01:40:57.570 --> 01:41:00.111]  So, but Air Force One had left, so we could land.
[01:41:00.151 --> 01:41:06.133]  So we pulled right up, and then right in front of us was this huge military transport vehicle, uh, airport.
[01:41:06.313 --> 01:41:07.774]  I mean huge, where the nose lifts up.
[01:41:07.794 --> 01:41:08.234]  Galaxy.
[01:41:08.414 --> 01:41:08.614]  Yeah.
[01:41:08.935 --> 01:41:14.277]  All of the, all of the cars, you know, his own cars and all the Secret Service cars were rolling in there.
[01:41:14.577 --> 01:41:16.358]  And as I was standing watching it, I realized,
[01:41:17.401 --> 01:41:18.842]  They're protecting the President.
[01:41:18.923 --> 01:41:19.563]  It's the military.
[01:41:19.603 --> 01:41:21.105]  And I was actually fortunate for that.
[01:41:21.145 --> 01:41:25.369]  Then I realized that the President's actually walking a line with the military.
[01:41:25.409 --> 01:41:29.133]  So then I understood what happened when he said, we're not going to Syria.
[01:41:29.353 --> 01:41:30.614]  But then they went and bombed Syria.
[01:41:30.654 --> 01:41:31.996]  But now he says we're not going to Syria.
[01:41:32.016 --> 01:41:33.117]  So he's struggling with that.
[01:41:34.258 --> 01:41:38.264]  You know, and I'm concerned about Bolton being around there, because he's a war hawk, as you know.
[01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:43.112]  So, you see this whole sit-down with North Korea, which needs to happen.
[01:41:43.392 --> 01:41:44.073]  Needs to happen.
[01:41:44.113 --> 01:41:47.839]  Now you've got... Bolton needs to step aside and get away from it.
[01:41:48.139 --> 01:41:48.740]  In actual fact...
[01:41:49.341 --> 01:41:52.065]  Trump needs to override everybody and say, I'm going to meet with Putin.
[01:41:52.265 --> 01:41:53.166]  I'm meeting with Putin.
[01:41:53.346 --> 01:41:53.747]  I agree.
[01:41:53.767 --> 01:41:55.269]  Well, he's already met with all the other world leaders.
[01:41:55.989 --> 01:42:04.320]  So in a few areas, this whole Russia thing has kind of... They did it on purpose to stop him because they know that he'll sit down and work things out.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:05.541]  We don't need another.
[01:42:05.621 --> 01:42:07.463]  We don't need a third world war right now.
[01:42:07.483 --> 01:42:08.624]  Well, that's the globalist program.
[01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:12.689]  They want ongoing crises, strategic tension, and Trump's pragmatic.
[01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:13.449]  He just wants peace.
[01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:21.297]  If people want war, they'll get it, but it's been globalists running America for so long that have been stirring up the problems, and that's why they're so upset right now.
[01:42:21.658 --> 01:42:23.880]  From World War I to World War II.
[01:42:24.801 --> 01:42:28.624]  To 9-11, to the endless war that we find ourselves in.
[01:42:29.004 --> 01:42:30.525]  And everybody thinks it's about terrorists.
[01:42:30.565 --> 01:42:32.987]  Well, the terrorists are trained here and shipped overseas, baby.
[01:42:33.187 --> 01:42:35.408]  You better wake up, stop and smell the coffee.
[01:42:35.789 --> 01:42:39.251]  Plus, not only that, it's about a pipeline.
[01:42:39.311 --> 01:42:40.592]  Syria's about a pipeline.
[01:42:40.932 --> 01:42:45.335]  It's about everybody heading for the base of the Caspian Sea with all the natural resources.
[01:42:45.355 --> 01:42:46.776]  That's what this whole fight is about.
[01:42:47.117 --> 01:42:49.038]  Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11.
[01:42:49.438 --> 01:42:50.119]  People smoke weed.
[01:42:50.159 --> 01:42:50.999]  That's right, that's right.
[01:42:51.059 --> 01:42:53.421]  Saudi Arabia wants control of all those pipelines.
[01:42:53.581 --> 01:42:56.625]  Correct, but it's all about the new caliphate and the whole thing, you know.
[01:42:57.066 --> 01:43:01.912]  Oh, and Turkey is basically declaring war on Trump, Israel, Israel, Europe.

[01:44:10.644 --> 01:44:11.184]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:11.585 --> 01:44:12.665]  Minister Alex Jones.
[01:44:12.865 --> 01:44:13.505]  Hey, brother.
[01:44:13.785 --> 01:44:14.145]  Good, man.
[01:44:14.166 --> 01:44:15.266]  Thank you for calling.
[01:44:15.326 --> 01:44:20.108]  Hey, I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:44:20.348 --> 01:44:26.710]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:28.530]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[01:44:28.630 --> 01:44:34.272]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:44:35.933 --> 01:44:37.054]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:44:37.114 --> 01:44:41.118]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:44:41.519 --> 01:44:43.141]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:44:43.581 --> 01:44:44.302]  And exactly.
[01:44:44.322 --> 01:44:48.586]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:44:48.927 --> 01:44:49.187]  Boom!
[01:44:49.347 --> 01:44:52.170]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:44:52.230 --> 01:44:52.771]  It's amazing.
[01:44:52.811 --> 01:44:57.055]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:45:04.119 --> 01:45:08.582]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:45:08.803 --> 01:45:13.486]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:45:14.107 --> 01:45:19.951]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[01:45:20.351 --> 01:45:32.961]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a shleet.
[01:45:33.701 --> 01:45:42.409]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:45:42.429 --> 01:45:44.311]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:45:44.651 --> 01:45:45.752]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:47.054]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:48.455]  He doesn't drink anything.
[01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:50.135]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:45:50.635 --> 01:45:52.236]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:45:52.256 --> 01:45:54.056]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:45:54.396 --> 01:45:57.017]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:45:57.037 --> 01:45:57.897]  This is insane.
[01:45:58.317 --> 01:45:59.937]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:46:00.197 --> 01:46:02.738]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:46:03.198 --> 01:46:04.718]  He says, this is totally free.
[01:46:04.738 --> 01:46:06.579]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:46:06.599 --> 01:46:08.439]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:46:09.319 --> 01:46:15.241]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:46:15.481 --> 01:46:16.841]  All just moderate dose.
[01:46:18.353 --> 01:46:26.340]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us a Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.763]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:28.783 --> 01:46:29.944]  But thank you for committing.
[01:46:34.025 --> 01:46:36.846]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:46:37.226 --> 01:46:39.827]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:46:39.847 --> 01:46:44.608]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:46:45.068 --> 01:46:51.190]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:46:51.230 --> 01:46:54.350]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:46:54.671 --> 01:46:55.991]  It's called reap what you sow.
[01:47:06.261 --> 01:47:08.874]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:27.074 --> 01:47:34.583]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:47:35.564 --> 01:47:39.469]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:39.929 --> 01:47:43.754]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:47:44.114 --> 01:47:45.676]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:46.056 --> 01:47:47.517]  Why do I call it information warfare?
[01:47:47.557 --> 01:47:51.519]  Because that's the term that governments use for information, whether it's true or not.
[01:47:51.599 --> 01:47:52.780]  Well, we're using the truth.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:48:01.185]  A lot more powerful than the lie, but as Mark Twain said, a lie can go halfway around the world before the truth gets up and puts its pants on.
[01:48:01.245 --> 01:48:04.387]  Rodney Howard Brown, author of The Killing of Uncle Sam, is here with us.
[01:48:04.407 --> 01:48:08.349]  He is on fire, on air, but also during the breaks.
[01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:14.233]  He's going to define the Mark of the Beast world government system that's now confirmed, now happening.
[01:48:15.359 --> 01:48:21.523]  When we start the next hour, his travels to Australia, his travels to India, his travels all over the world.
[01:48:22.343 --> 01:48:27.407]  I mean, for folks that don't know who Rodney Howard Brown is, he's one of the most prolific missionaries in the world today.
[01:48:27.427 --> 01:48:38.754]  I know you came here wanting to talk about InfoWars and what we're doing and, you know, all the news, but briefly, get into what you're doing, your ministry, the other books, the things that are happening and where you see the world at this pivotal
[01:48:40.444 --> 01:48:44.968]  I guess last reprieve, or you were during the break calling it something else.
[01:48:45.089 --> 01:48:45.769]  We have a window.
[01:48:45.949 --> 01:48:46.590]  Window, window.
[01:48:46.650 --> 01:48:48.612]  Yeah, we have a window to turn this thing around.
[01:48:49.172 --> 01:48:56.379]  So, when my wife and I came here 30 years ago, we landed the country December 1987, landed with $300, didn't hardly know anybody, just knew
[01:48:59.122 --> 01:49:01.082]  That I was supposed to come here as a missionary.
[01:49:01.462 --> 01:49:06.223]  And so it was a long process for me, even to become a United States citizen, went through the ringer.
[01:49:06.283 --> 01:49:09.304]  That's why I'm against illegals coming across the border.
[01:49:09.344 --> 01:49:11.725]  There's a right way of coming and a wrong way of coming.
[01:49:11.985 --> 01:49:14.565]  And if you come, then you adopt the American way of life.
[01:49:14.965 --> 01:49:15.345]  Period.
[01:49:15.765 --> 01:49:17.326]  And you adopt the Constitution.
[01:49:17.626 --> 01:49:23.987]  You do not come here with subversive ideas of overthrowing a country or diluting the way that this country is.
[01:49:24.287 --> 01:49:25.367]  America is America.
[01:49:25.607 --> 01:49:28.448]  John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, if you don't like that,
[01:49:29.068 --> 01:49:29.988]  Head on out, baby.
[01:49:30.308 --> 01:49:48.533]  So, here we are, we arrived in America, December 1987, and I traveled, just my wife, myself, three kids in a vehicle, going all across America, little churches, just, you know, praying, really trying to find our feet in what we're supposed to be doing.
[01:49:49.133 --> 01:49:54.996]  And then in April of 89 a revival broke out in upstate New York that carried us now to 59 countries.
[01:49:55.236 --> 01:50:04.762]  And it's controversial because if you go back to the first great awakenings you see what happened where the power of God would overwhelm whole places and people would be overwhelmed spiritually.
[01:50:04.782 --> 01:50:06.583]  And it's spiritual, the enemy can feel it though.
[01:50:06.923 --> 01:50:12.226]  And we can feel the revival just understanding information is about to break out.
[01:50:12.406 --> 01:50:12.686]  Correct.
[01:50:13.367 --> 01:50:22.659]  So what happens is, because in our meetings we have a lot of joy, which I'm actually a very serious person, because I've realized the battle that we're up against, but people get filled with joy.
[01:50:22.679 --> 01:50:25.142]  So we were attacked by the religious sector.
[01:50:25.182 --> 01:50:26.203]  People try to block us.
[01:50:26.563 --> 01:50:27.304]  So Alex, I mean, 1989,
[01:50:28.726 --> 01:50:29.227]  No, I agree.
[01:50:29.247 --> 01:50:29.567]  You're right.
[01:50:29.607 --> 01:50:33.911]  We've got to be happier about this because at least we're awake and aren't overtaken by the enemy.
[01:50:33.931 --> 01:50:38.575]  Even though we get upset by the bad stuff happening, we should be really positive that we're at least awake.
[01:50:38.715 --> 01:50:40.537]  And the Bible says, the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[01:50:40.597 --> 01:50:47.183]  Plus, when the disciples came to Jesus and they said, you know, even the devils are subject to us through your name.
[01:50:47.923 --> 01:50:50.204]  Jesus didn't say, oh, that's great, I'm so happy to know.
[01:50:50.484 --> 01:50:52.926]  He said, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
[01:50:53.206 --> 01:50:58.388]  He said, don't rejoice that devils are subject to you, but rejoice that your name's written now in the Lamb's Book of Life.
[01:50:58.668 --> 01:51:00.970]  And you go through many of the churches, and they're sad.
[01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:05.072]  I mean, we go to churches, one hour dry-cleaning service, in by ten, out by eleven.
[01:51:05.352 --> 01:51:08.033]  I mean, you're so happy when it's finished, because it's boring.
[01:51:08.253 --> 01:51:09.814]  There's no life, there's no strength.
[01:51:09.834 --> 01:51:12.055]  But if you hear a real preacher of the Holy Ghost, you don't want to leave.
[01:51:12.555 --> 01:51:15.677]  Exactly, and as a matter of fact, we're there three, three and a half hours.
[01:51:16.397 --> 01:51:24.204]  Sometimes in our conferences, which start the Sunday through Sunday, eight days, two meetings a day, 16 meetings, and the service will go five hours.
[01:51:24.284 --> 01:51:25.285]  Nobody wants to go home.
[01:51:25.585 --> 01:51:27.927]  I have to tell the car, OK, the service is over.
[01:51:28.047 --> 01:51:28.687]  It's finished now.
[01:51:28.747 --> 01:51:29.348]  You can go home.
[01:51:29.608 --> 01:51:30.449]  Nobody wants to leave.
[01:51:30.809 --> 01:51:32.430]  If I don't leave the platform, they don't leave.
[01:51:32.791 --> 01:51:35.813]  So people say, oh, people won't even do that.
[01:51:36.154 --> 01:51:36.914]  Are you kidding me?
[01:51:37.134 --> 01:51:37.695]  They go watch
[01:51:38.035 --> 01:51:41.358]  Listen, I'm not even as strong as you are.
[01:51:41.698 --> 01:51:49.804]  Before they dialed us back on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, I could just be calmly talking, and it would just build up like a million watching, and they wouldn't go away.
[01:51:49.844 --> 01:51:50.865]  They'd say, don't stop it.
[01:51:50.925 --> 01:51:53.948]  There's a hunger for exposing evil.
[01:51:54.448 --> 01:51:55.569]  People are hungry for the truth.
[01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:56.810]  And they already know.
[01:51:56.950 --> 01:52:00.593]  People in their gut know that they're being sold bill of goods.
[01:52:01.133 --> 01:52:04.656]  So anyway, when you look at what's taking place, we have a window.
[01:52:05.997 --> 01:52:07.699]  Getting back to what we're doing.
[01:52:07.759 --> 01:52:15.226]  So we've been going from church to church with revival, trying to revive dead churches, get pastors on fire, get the people doing what they're doing.
[01:52:15.246 --> 01:52:16.126]  Trying to ignite the spirit.
[01:52:16.427 --> 01:52:20.190]  And yeah, because of the Great Commission, which is going to all the world and preach the gospel.
[01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:23.753]  If we are quiet about it, Islam is not quiet about what they're doing.
[01:52:24.013 --> 01:52:25.975]  There are more mosques being built in America.
[01:52:26.035 --> 01:52:30.880]  They are charging forward, spending all their money, buying off the media, just they are
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:38.528]  And 95% of the American church... That's the thing, is we're being assaulted and raped by it, because Christians don't blow you up to make you accept it.
[01:52:38.808 --> 01:52:39.829]  They don't get in your face.
[01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:40.831]  They don't boycott you.
[01:52:41.051 --> 01:52:44.475]  But the Muslims, that's why the left loves them, because you add those two groups together.
[01:52:44.715 --> 01:52:47.698]  Or all the atheists, or all the other people.
[01:52:48.039 --> 01:52:50.762]  Why are the atheists and liberals and Islam allied?
[01:52:51.583 --> 01:52:52.564]  Because they hate God.
[01:52:54.810 --> 01:52:55.271]  I hate God.
[01:52:55.511 --> 01:52:56.212]  But here's the thing.
[01:52:56.432 --> 01:53:01.158]  So if 95% of the American church do not tell another person about Jesus, they never tell.
[01:53:01.259 --> 01:53:01.779]  They never tell.
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:06.405]  95% of the people sitting in the pews never tell another person about Jesus.
[01:53:06.465 --> 01:53:09.109]  But if they see a great movie, they tell you, you've got to see this movie.
[01:53:09.329 --> 01:53:11.812]  They go to a nice restaurant, they've taught us to be ashamed.
[01:53:12.293 --> 01:53:12.693]  Totally!
[01:53:12.994 --> 01:53:18.038]  So now, so they go to church, they do their thing, and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, there's nothing.
[01:53:18.058 --> 01:53:18.759]  But what did Christ say?
[01:53:18.799 --> 01:53:20.761]  He said, if you're ashamed of me, I'll be ashamed of you.
[01:53:20.861 --> 01:53:21.181]  Correct.
[01:53:21.341 --> 01:53:23.624]  And he said, go into all the world and preach the gospel.
[01:53:23.664 --> 01:53:26.426]  In actual fact, he said, compel the lost and dying to come in.
[01:53:26.907 --> 01:53:34.794]  So, so what we do is go to churches, put the fire of God on them, and then mobilize them during the day on the streets to go and evangelize.
[01:53:35.294 --> 01:53:40.639]  Schools, universities, retirement homes, prisons, which by the way, I've talked to high-level Google people.
[01:53:40.999 --> 01:53:43.341]  They are more afraid of anything of real Christians.
[01:53:44.524 --> 01:54:06.598]  Even Jade Helm talks about motivated Christians, motivated individuals, who then get on the street because the act of physically in the third dimension taking action is so frightening to the whole Silicon Valley because they want to get us into virtual reality and get us out of the real world and teach us that there's no power in the real world, only online, as they even take the power away from being online.
[01:54:06.698 --> 01:54:06.978]  Correct.
[01:54:07.179 --> 01:54:08.760]  And the big thing is face-to-face.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:14.485]  When you meet people and you look into their eyes, they can see this is a real, always phony.
[01:54:14.945 --> 01:54:16.367]  Now, religious people can't do this.
[01:54:16.427 --> 01:54:19.069]  If they're just religious, nobody's going to follow them.
[01:54:19.590 --> 01:54:24.715]  But when people come that know Jesus, when they come to them and they look in their eyes, people say,
[01:54:24.875 --> 01:54:25.435]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:54:25.475 --> 01:54:29.637]  Devil worshippers and people in the occult are seeking for discernment and real knowledge.
[01:54:29.697 --> 01:54:31.838]  And I'm not a perfect person, but I have a relationship with God.
[01:54:32.158 --> 01:54:41.061]  The discernment and the knowledge is, like, so powerful that I even deal with globalists, and they're like slaves, compartmentalized to their one little system of control.
[01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:43.742]  They're given power by the system, but they have no power.
[01:54:43.942 --> 01:54:44.522]  They're slaves.
[01:54:44.922 --> 01:54:46.303]  And you actually tune into Christ.
[01:54:46.383 --> 01:54:47.303]  It's, like, so big.
[01:54:47.363 --> 01:54:49.904]  You're like, I can't believe I've got this much power.
[01:54:50.144 --> 01:54:51.745]  And then these Satanists have no idea.
[01:54:51.765 --> 01:54:54.166]  They're searching for power, and the power's right there.
[01:54:54.426 --> 01:54:56.647]  And which is what Jesus told the disciples.
[01:54:57.107 --> 01:55:01.168]  You can read in John 4, he talked about a well of water springing up to everlasting life.
[01:55:01.248 --> 01:55:05.829]  John 7, he's talked about out of your innermost being will flow rivers of living water.
[01:55:05.869 --> 01:55:07.410]  So he's talking about the Holy Spirit.
[01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:11.491]  Then Jesus is the one that told the disciples to go tarry at Jerusalem.
[01:55:12.111 --> 01:55:13.852]  And he said, you will be endeared with power.
[01:55:13.933 --> 01:55:19.217]  You shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost come upon you and you shall be witnesses under me.
[01:55:19.497 --> 01:55:23.800]  So it's not so we can sit in a pew or sit in the church or just have a nice little time.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:27.203]  No, you're getting charged up in the church with the brethren to go do something!
[01:55:27.363 --> 01:55:28.164]  To go do something!
[01:55:28.684 --> 01:55:30.205]  And everybody has to do something.
[01:55:30.465 --> 01:55:34.228]  You don't plug a device into a wall to then have it sit there.
[01:55:34.569 --> 01:55:36.530]  You're plugging it in to unplug it and go out and do something.
[01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.890]  Totally.
[01:55:37.110 --> 01:55:44.336]  But by the same thing, if we bring an electric appliance in here, we plug it in and switch the switch on.
[01:55:44.756 --> 01:55:47.357]  So a lot of people are praying for what they already have.
[01:55:47.398 --> 01:55:49.098]  They're praying, oh God, please help us.
[01:55:49.138 --> 01:55:50.839]  God's already done everything to help you.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.260]  Jesus went to the cross.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.341]  The Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost.
[01:55:54.621 --> 01:55:55.502]  God is not dead.
[01:55:55.762 --> 01:55:58.203]  And I don't have to watch a movie to know that He's not dead.
[01:55:58.564 --> 01:55:59.264]  He's not dead.
[01:55:59.644 --> 01:56:03.246]  I don't have to watch God's Not Dead 1 and 2 to know He's not dead.
[01:56:03.506 --> 01:56:04.467]  He's alive.
[01:56:05.147 --> 01:56:09.910]  But how can people even deny it when everything in Revelation is now coming true exactly?
[01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:12.131]  We're going to cover it next hour.
[01:56:41.031 --> 01:56:45.135]  Even when you, like when you go to sleep at night, then the next day you have to deal with some major stuff.
[01:56:45.396 --> 01:56:46.797]  So you say, Lord, I'm gonna go to sleep.
[01:56:47.057 --> 01:56:49.400]  And I pray that when I wake up, I'll know exactly what to do.
[01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:52.564]  Many times I get up in the morning and I know, do this, do this, do this.
[01:56:53.550 --> 01:56:56.271]  And it's the most amazing thing because the Holy Spirit's been sent to help us.
[01:56:56.571 --> 01:56:57.791]  He's the unseen one.
[01:56:58.071 --> 01:57:00.012]  People think that the Holy Spirit is a manifestation.
[01:57:00.032 --> 01:57:03.893]  These devil worshippers are killing little kids so a big demon gets in them to give them power.
[01:57:04.253 --> 01:57:07.754]  When the creator of the entire universe is ready to already give you the real power.
[01:57:07.774 --> 01:57:08.095]  Totally.
[01:57:08.175 --> 01:57:12.256]  Well that's what Hollywood, they have to actually take on spirits to actually act.
[01:57:12.816 --> 01:57:17.618]  You remember, I think it was Jack Nicholson said to the guy that was going to play
[01:57:19.578 --> 01:57:20.679]  I forget the name.
[01:57:20.719 --> 01:57:21.340]  They admit it.
[01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:23.441]  Bob Dylan said, no, I had to sell my soul to Lucifer.
[01:57:23.461 --> 01:57:28.144]  But he said, the kid that died, man, he was playing, was in the Batman movie or whatever.
[01:57:28.164 --> 01:57:29.726]  He said, don't play that part.
[01:57:30.146 --> 01:57:30.766]  Don't play that.
[01:57:30.806 --> 01:57:31.847]  It's a dark part.
[01:57:31.867 --> 01:57:33.348]  He said, do not play that part.
[01:57:33.628 --> 01:57:35.430]  Well, he went and played it, and of course he died.
[01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:40.053]  So the thing is, people sell their soul to Lucifer, and then he comes to collect them.
[01:57:40.333 --> 01:57:44.897]  Major singers, major actors, major people out there that are wanting money.
[01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:46.197]  They want fame and fortune.
[01:57:46.458 --> 01:57:48.179]  So they sell their soul to the devil.
[01:57:48.339 --> 01:57:49.399]  And then he comes and takes them.
[01:57:49.579 --> 01:57:50.219]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:55.861]  Western Europe has already banned free speech.
[01:57:56.621 --> 01:58:00.802]  And an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:58:01.182 --> 01:58:08.763]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:58:09.163 --> 01:58:13.444]  CNN and many others are calling for Infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:58:13.804 --> 01:58:15.965]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying,
[01:58:16.545 --> 01:58:17.746]  Go beyond censorship.
[01:58:17.906 --> 01:58:20.767]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:58:21.087 --> 01:58:25.309]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:58:26.170 --> 01:58:29.211]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:58:30.151 --> 01:58:34.894]  That's why it's more important than ever that folks stay in contact with InfoWars.
[01:58:35.514 --> 01:58:41.717]  If you sign up for our free newsletter that goes out daily at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[01:58:42.731 --> 01:58:53.677]  We will send you breaking videos, breaking articles, key analysis, and links to all of our podcasts, all of our live feeds, all of our live streams at the bottom.
[01:58:53.918 --> 01:58:54.638]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:58:55.078 --> 01:58:59.581]  And we've got backups, so that we have that personal, direct relationship with you.
[01:59:00.281 --> 01:59:06.944]  I was never good about email and, you know, collecting folks' email like everybody else does because I was always going for the latest cutting-edge stuff.
[01:59:07.004 --> 01:59:07.605]  We still do that.
[01:59:08.025 --> 01:59:12.027]  But all the experts have told me, Alex, if they shut everything down, it gets really bad.
[01:59:12.507 --> 01:59:21.611]  You've got to have a thumb drive with those emails so you can contact the base core of patriots that understand what's happening, the real remnant.
[01:59:22.171 --> 01:59:26.774]  Now, we're hoping for the best, ladies and gentlemen, but we're also preparing for the worst.
[01:59:27.014 --> 01:59:29.635]  That's why it's so critical, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:59:29.735 --> 01:59:43.607]  But you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:59:43.847 --> 01:59:45.128]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:59:45.348 --> 01:59:51.594]  So please sign up for the free newsletter today and then share the emails with everyone you know to cause a chain reaction.
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:00.784]  If you are receiving this translation, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:14.884 --> 02:00:18.627]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:00:18.947 --> 02:00:23.130]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:44.684 --> 02:00:46.007]  Those are coming out, so they want to spin it.
[02:00:46.368 --> 02:00:53.263]  But it also could be fake videos, because I've had Megyn Kelly when I said Hillary Clinton is responsible for killing children in the Arab Spring.
[02:00:54.306 --> 02:00:56.087]  And murdering them by funding it.
[02:00:56.167 --> 02:00:57.167]  And I showed news articles.
[02:00:57.527 --> 02:01:08.950]  She edited the video together, made it audio before she left Fox News, and had me saying that they were murdering children in a pizza place to then discredit larger investigations.
[02:01:09.330 --> 02:01:11.591]  So, they don't need high-tech stuff to do that.
[02:01:11.611 --> 02:01:13.871]  They're already deceptively editing.
[02:01:13.891 --> 02:01:14.531]  Can you speak to that?
[02:01:14.912 --> 02:01:19.993]  Yeah, because it's all about misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda.
[02:01:20.433 --> 02:01:21.755]  So that's how the enemy works.
[02:01:21.795 --> 02:01:23.537]  The devil operates through lies.
[02:01:23.998 --> 02:01:24.799]  Lies and lies.
[02:01:25.039 --> 02:01:28.123]  And that's what the lies spread around the world.
[02:01:28.543 --> 02:01:31.847]  And you see it on all the mainstream media.
[02:01:32.308 --> 02:01:33.149]  On the newspapers.
[02:01:33.169 --> 02:01:35.092]  They're all controlled by the same people, folks.
[02:01:35.892 --> 02:01:38.014]  Operation Mockingbird took over all the media.
[02:01:38.254 --> 02:01:44.839]  So that's why we sit with the problems that we sit today, because people feed on that stuff, and that's what they believe.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:52.345]  And the universities that were taken over, standardized of education over a hundred years ago, even of the seminaries.
[02:01:52.746 --> 02:01:55.508]  So, passes are coming out, clueless.
[02:01:56.168 --> 02:01:58.650]  Students are graduating out of high school, clueless.
[02:01:59.431 --> 02:02:02.494]  People graduating out of university, totally
[02:02:03.294 --> 02:02:03.795]  Ill-equipped.
[02:02:04.195 --> 02:02:05.336]  Have no clue what's going on.
[02:02:05.357 --> 02:02:09.561]  And it's spiritual because you can take one of these omified people and actually get them...
[02:02:10.424 --> 02:02:13.305]  You're connected to God, suddenly they awaken and go, wow, where was I?
[02:02:13.705 --> 02:02:16.686]  What do you call that when they're in a delusion, like under a spell?
[02:02:16.946 --> 02:02:19.547]  It's like the God of this world has blinded their eyes.
[02:02:19.627 --> 02:02:20.448]  There's no other way.
[02:02:21.008 --> 02:02:23.909]  The enemy has blinded their eyes so they can't see the truth.
[02:02:24.409 --> 02:02:30.551]  And so that's a way they lean, where they accuse us of being, you know, we're just right-wing conspiracy or whatever.
[02:02:30.611 --> 02:02:32.552]  No, we've actually looked at the facts.
[02:02:32.952 --> 02:02:34.993]  You know, when you travel 59 countries of the world,
[02:02:35.773 --> 02:02:38.875]  I see the same scenario repeated in all the countries that we go to.
[02:02:39.175 --> 02:02:42.778]  It's just different names, different players, but it's the same narrative.
[02:02:42.818 --> 02:02:43.238]  That's it.
[02:02:43.278 --> 02:02:46.300]  The devil is very formulaic, which is the strength, but also its weakness.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.981]  But it is exactly formulaic.
[02:02:48.441 --> 02:02:49.582]  Well, look what he did to Adam.
[02:02:49.622 --> 02:02:52.544]  He said, if you do, I'll give you all of this.
[02:02:52.804 --> 02:02:54.786]  I mean, basically, he came to Jesus.
[02:02:54.846 --> 02:02:58.608]  He said, if you will bow down before me, I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world.
[02:02:58.988 --> 02:03:02.090]  Adam was the one that sold everything out to Lucifer.
[02:03:02.430 --> 02:03:02.971]  And so that's
[02:03:03.591 --> 02:03:14.526]  By the way, when I was offered by the biggest syndicator in the country, the book deals, the Fox deals, the $10 million a year, all this stuff, and that's $10 million to me, not $10 million to fund an operation.
[02:03:15.632 --> 02:03:18.194]  Of course, it meant nothing because it was a sellout because they said, we'll control you.
[02:03:18.274 --> 02:03:19.295]  It was just like that.
[02:03:19.556 --> 02:03:24.500]  I was up in a high building and looking down on New York and it was just like the devil.
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:26.381]  And then they even made devil jokes.
[02:03:26.922 --> 02:03:28.944]  And then Mark Dice got called into Hollywood.
[02:03:28.964 --> 02:03:32.707]  They wanted to give a national TV show with one of the guys from Motley Crue.
[02:03:33.147 --> 02:03:35.189]  And they said, but we just want you to say you denounce Christ.
[02:03:35.569 --> 02:03:36.250]  He says, is this a joke?
[02:03:36.270 --> 02:03:37.391]  They said, no, you got the show.
[02:03:37.411 --> 02:03:40.193]  You're going to make a million dollars a year just announcing Jesus right now.
[02:03:40.714 --> 02:03:42.155]  And Mark went, wow, this is really real.
[02:03:42.175 --> 02:03:43.096]  They said, yeah, no, it's real.
[02:03:44.736 --> 02:03:47.317]  I mean, they take you up in buildings and tell you!
[02:03:47.577 --> 02:03:48.198]  It's blatant.
[02:03:48.398 --> 02:03:49.498]  It's just like with Christ!
[02:03:49.658 --> 02:03:49.898]  Sure.
[02:03:50.238 --> 02:03:51.319]  They do the same thing.
[02:03:51.339 --> 02:03:52.059]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:03:52.079 --> 02:03:53.640]  It's like a program.
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:55.360]  There's nothing there.
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.521]  It's like a... Sure.
[02:03:56.781 --> 02:03:59.162]  But the bombardment starts with the daycare.
[02:03:59.342 --> 02:04:04.684]  From our little kids, bombarded in daycare, all the way to primary school, high school, and university.
[02:04:04.724 --> 02:04:07.025]  So I try to tell parents, teach your own kids.
[02:04:07.085 --> 02:04:07.825]  Do homeschool.
[02:04:08.165 --> 02:04:13.267]  You know, there's programs you can get where kids will actually, by the time they graduate, be way ahead.
[02:04:13.587 --> 02:04:15.629]  We're going to talk about solutions that are going to break.
[02:04:15.749 --> 02:04:18.050]  But when I told you that story, Mark Dice has come on and talked about it.
[02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:20.092]  And he's had big national shows and stuff.
[02:04:20.492 --> 02:04:21.293]  They really told him that.
[02:04:21.753 --> 02:04:22.313]  Unbelievable.
[02:04:22.633 --> 02:04:24.155]  They wouldn't do that to you as pastors.
[02:04:24.695 --> 02:04:28.898]  I'm telling you, people like me, a long time ago, when I was like 25 years old, they point blank.
[02:04:29.939 --> 02:04:31.520]  But they didn't say, hey, we're devil worshipers.
[02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:34.222]  But it was like you're up in a big building and they're going, you can have all this, don't you want it?
[02:04:35.928 --> 02:04:36.628]  Unbelievable.
[02:04:36.849 --> 02:04:39.870]  But I'm saying, how weird is that that they repeat the same thing over and over again?
[02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:41.691]  Sure, well, it's the same.
[02:04:42.291 --> 02:04:46.893]  That's why we put this out, because it's the same history repeats itself over and over.
[02:04:46.993 --> 02:04:50.755]  Folks, the Mark of the Beast world government, at least a prototype of it, is here.
[02:04:51.115 --> 02:04:52.576]  Prophecy has been fulfilled.
[02:04:52.936 --> 02:05:00.520]  We're going to talk about it with Pastor Brown on the other side, the author of Killing of Uncle Sam at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:00.940]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.502 --> 02:05:10.387]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[02:05:10.667 --> 02:05:14.890]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
[02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:20.393]  And it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[02:05:20.433 --> 02:05:23.435]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[02:05:23.676 --> 02:05:24.896]  It's Brain Force Plus.

[02:05:38.965 --> 02:05:41.046]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[02:05:41.546 --> 02:05:49.710]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.
[02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:52.611]  We need your emergency contribution today.
[02:05:53.031 --> 02:05:56.533]  Go to the InfoWars store and click on the donate button.
[02:05:56.853 --> 02:05:57.954]  We need your help.
[02:06:07.391 --> 02:06:11.438]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:06:12.059 --> 02:06:13.462]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:06:18.746 --> 02:06:20.548]  The book is The Killing of Uncle Sam.
[02:06:20.608 --> 02:06:21.728]  It comes out next Tuesday.
[02:06:21.769 --> 02:06:23.270]  We're selling it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:06:23.290 --> 02:06:25.471]  You can find the audiobooks everywhere else.
[02:06:26.192 --> 02:06:29.094]  It's going to be great, because that's how I really read books now, is audiobooks.
[02:06:29.134 --> 02:06:34.238]  But I got an advanced copy of this, one of the last books I've read in the last six months, The Killing of Uncle Sam.
[02:06:34.619 --> 02:06:35.620]  And I don't care where you get it.
[02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:37.281]  Where is the best place for people to get it?
[02:06:37.681 --> 02:06:38.202]  InfoWars.
[02:06:38.642 --> 02:06:39.883]  But tell people your site, too.
[02:06:40.023 --> 02:06:41.544]  Okay, Revival.com.
[02:06:41.584 --> 02:06:43.126]  KillingUncleSamBook.com.
[02:06:43.986 --> 02:06:46.047]  Or go, here's what'll really help too.
[02:06:46.428 --> 02:06:50.930]  If you're out, go to Barnes & Noble and tell them, please stock the book.
[02:06:51.211 --> 02:06:54.112]  If you're flying anywhere through an airport, go to the airport bookstores.
[02:06:54.252 --> 02:06:54.593]  Ask them.
[02:06:54.833 --> 02:06:55.053]  Yes.
[02:06:55.113 --> 02:06:59.275]  And people don't get, it's that word of mouth, especially in the digital age, trumps everything.
[02:06:59.395 --> 02:06:59.636]  Correct.
[02:06:59.916 --> 02:07:02.737]  So we need to get the word out, because we don't want this book stocked.
[02:07:03.138 --> 02:07:04.759]  We want to get this information out.
[02:07:04.919 --> 02:07:09.101]  And let me say this, I don't even take a royalty from it, neither does my co-author Paul Rims.
[02:07:09.141 --> 02:07:10.282]  But I hope you make money on it.
[02:07:10.282 --> 02:07:11.103]  We need to fund your operation.
[02:07:11.123 --> 02:07:12.644]  Yeah, it's going to go to our school of government.
[02:07:12.684 --> 02:07:13.785]  We started a school of government.
[02:07:13.825 --> 02:07:14.926]  I know you gave me 500 copies.
[02:07:14.966 --> 02:07:15.566]  I appreciate it.
[02:07:15.606 --> 02:07:17.247]  Yeah, I wanted to be a part of what you're doing.
[02:07:17.648 --> 02:07:22.511]  Because what you're doing is... By the way, I've watched you for years, a decade on TV, listened to you.
[02:07:22.912 --> 02:07:24.833]  You were taken aback when I told you about the Mark Dice.
[02:07:24.873 --> 02:07:25.374]  We've had him on.
[02:07:25.394 --> 02:07:26.154]  These clips are real.
[02:07:26.715 --> 02:07:27.876]  Mark Dice, you're the media critic.
[02:07:28.096 --> 02:07:28.836]  Oh, I watched him, yeah.
[02:07:28.896 --> 02:07:30.558]  Yeah, billions of views, probably a billion views.
[02:07:31.659 --> 02:07:34.441]  They actually got him up before he would be given this national TV show.
[02:07:34.701 --> 02:07:37.143]  And I even know the company he was involved in, because I did some TV stuff.
[02:07:37.504 --> 02:07:40.386]  They didn't ever tell me, hey, we want you to reject Jesus or anything.
[02:07:40.746 --> 02:07:41.747]  But they did with him.
[02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:45.751]  And I've talked to other people in Hollywood where they actually asked you to renounce Christ.
[02:07:46.431 --> 02:07:47.852]  I didn't doubt that for one second.
[02:07:48.809 --> 02:07:49.770]  So that's the attack.
[02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:51.210]  That's the whole attack.
[02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:54.672]  So I feel that we have a last minute reprieve, Alex.
[02:07:54.832 --> 02:07:55.573]  I really feel that.
[02:07:55.673 --> 02:08:02.796]  You know, 2008 was a real critical year for us before, you know, we were just looking at where America was headed.
[02:08:03.457 --> 02:08:07.199]  And I was actually speaking in Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:08:07.759 --> 02:08:15.201]  And on a Monday night, as I was preaching, I just began to speak this out, come right out of my spirit, and I said, it was really talking to the church.
[02:08:15.501 --> 02:08:21.142]  It's like I heard the Lord say, tell the church to speak to the sun, and tell the sun, no, you can't set just yet.
[02:08:21.522 --> 02:08:27.684]  But the sun is far setting on the horizon of time, but just like Joshua, command the sun and the moon to stand still.
[02:08:28.567 --> 02:08:30.207]  And the Lord gave him one more day.
[02:08:30.708 --> 02:08:34.088]  The Lord said, I will give you one more hour, one more hour of daylight.
[02:08:34.108 --> 02:08:36.689]  So I kind of figured, OK, what's an hour of daylight?
[02:08:36.969 --> 02:08:40.270]  If a thousand years a day, a thousand years, that'll be 40 years.
[02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:41.270]  So I said, OK, great.
[02:08:41.470 --> 02:08:45.251]  That'll put me into my late 80s and we can smack this thing up the side of the head.
[02:08:45.611 --> 02:08:46.571]  And that's the hour.
[02:08:46.631 --> 02:08:47.431]  Because here's the thing.
[02:08:47.712 --> 02:08:50.232]  A hundred years from now, we'll be in heaven, you and me.
[02:08:50.852 --> 02:08:55.553]  And then we look at each other and we think, did we play the fool with our life on the earth?
[02:08:56.214 --> 02:08:57.634]  Was there more that we could have done?
[02:08:58.713 --> 02:09:00.735]  Well, that's the feeling I constantly have.
[02:09:00.835 --> 02:09:04.097]  It's not that I'm big enough or a good man or any of this.
[02:09:04.517 --> 02:09:08.100]  I feel like with all I've got, I should be doing more and I'm constantly frustrated.
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:14.784]  And then in my gut, God just says, look, just trust in God, be good, be strong, tell the truth, it's all going to work out.
[02:09:14.804 --> 02:09:18.507]  That'll never go away because that's the thing that causes you to reach out.
[02:09:18.927 --> 02:09:19.768]  So that'll never go away.
[02:09:19.828 --> 02:09:22.350]  So be encouraged about that because I deal with the exact same thing.
[02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:25.171]  So, I mean, when we... It could be midnight!
[02:09:25.211 --> 02:09:25.931]  I thought, I don't know.
[02:09:26.071 --> 02:09:26.331]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09:26.611 --> 02:09:29.552]  So, in... Because we know it's like this evil is coming.
[02:09:29.572 --> 02:09:36.194]  2007, 8 and 9, we went to 55 cities across America and saw 1.1 million people give their lives to the Lord.
[02:09:36.475 --> 02:09:38.315]  That's in schools, retirement homes.
[02:09:38.355 --> 02:09:44.577]  We went to all the retirement homes where people were dying, left by their families, and people were confessing Jesus and praying with us.
[02:09:44.957 --> 02:09:46.998]  Some of the ladies, they actually prayed.
[02:09:47.198 --> 02:09:49.359]  People prayed and their last words were,
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:52.021]  Thank you, Jesus, for saving me.
[02:09:52.241 --> 02:09:52.922]  And they died.
[02:09:53.062 --> 02:09:54.983]  They died right as they prayed the prayer.
[02:09:55.003 --> 02:09:56.845]  And you know they were probably waiting for that.
[02:09:56.885 --> 02:09:57.245]  They were.
[02:09:57.265 --> 02:09:58.986]  Well, here's one classic example.
[02:09:59.066 --> 02:10:02.789]  It's like my mom, she was a Christian, but she waited until my dad got her to die.
[02:10:02.809 --> 02:10:04.271]  She's like, oh, you're here, and died.
[02:10:04.471 --> 02:10:05.171]  What happened?
[02:10:05.511 --> 02:10:08.774]  One of our people that we trained went into a retirement home.
[02:10:08.814 --> 02:10:12.417]  This lady, 83 years of age, she's sitting curled up in a fetal position.
[02:10:12.717 --> 02:10:15.559]  And Alex, no family, no body, no food.
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:16.800]  She's only given water.
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:17.301]  She's dying.
[02:10:17.761 --> 02:10:18.522]  And she's groaning.
[02:10:21.264 --> 02:10:23.565]  And one of our people shook her awake.
[02:10:23.765 --> 02:10:25.086]  She looked right up in the eye.
[02:10:25.286 --> 02:10:26.327]  She didn't know who it was.
[02:10:26.607 --> 02:10:28.869]  And she said, my soul is lost.
[02:10:29.709 --> 02:10:33.372]  So she knew she was dying and there was nobody there to pray with her before she died.
[02:10:33.712 --> 02:10:35.153]  And they prayed with her right there.
[02:10:35.453 --> 02:10:37.295]  Led her to Christ immediately.
[02:10:37.595 --> 02:10:39.036]  They went down to the next room.
[02:10:39.056 --> 02:10:43.359]  20 minutes later they went by and there was a sheath covering this lady.
[02:10:44.119 --> 02:10:46.161]  They plucked her right out of the jaws of hell.
[02:10:48.511 --> 02:10:50.752]  That's powerful.
[02:10:50.772 --> 02:10:54.154]  That's like right on the cross.
[02:10:54.195 --> 02:11:04.041]  That brings tears to my eyes to think about how people warehouse their parents and then they die alone and then these people don't think they're not going to die like that.
[02:11:04.501 --> 02:11:07.003]  I mean right there, that's a test right there if you don't take care of your parents.
[02:11:07.363 --> 02:11:09.325]  We've got to reach, we've got to win the lost.
[02:11:09.865 --> 02:11:12.728]  Alex, you know, the Bible says he who wins souls is wise.
[02:11:13.089 --> 02:11:20.516]  John 3, 16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[02:11:20.796 --> 02:11:23.859]  And then the Bible says God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world.
[02:11:24.119 --> 02:11:30.906]  So God's not against anybody, he loves everybody, but he wants people to know that the price was paid
[02:11:31.266 --> 02:11:32.747]  On Calvary, Jesus did it all.
[02:11:32.907 --> 02:11:42.590]  And by the way, we know because the whole wicked anti-human system that dumbs people down, that sterilizes, that poisons the earth, everything out of it is evil, nothing good, it hates Christ.
[02:11:42.610 --> 02:11:46.312]  It doesn't hate the fake churches, that's the counterfeit, it hates Christ.
[02:11:46.372 --> 02:11:47.152]  That's the Antichrist.
[02:11:47.652 --> 02:11:50.073]  Antichrist spirit is anything that's Antichrist.
[02:11:51.158 --> 02:11:52.219]  Which he came to give life.
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:55.023]  And you look at Hollywood, Bezos, all of it.
[02:11:55.063 --> 02:11:56.505]  It's totally anti-Christ.
[02:11:56.726 --> 02:11:57.066]  Totally.
[02:11:57.867 --> 02:12:00.090]  We're going to go to break in about four minutes.
[02:12:00.110 --> 02:12:00.911]  I want you to come down to the floor.
[02:12:00.971 --> 02:12:02.974]  But Dr. Ismael, I was thinking about that powerful story.
[02:12:03.374 --> 02:12:07.260]  But I want you to specifically speak to
[02:12:10.037 --> 02:12:28.726]  Just, I mean, like, time frames, reprieves, so people understand this, because so many Christians think they're just dead, and they don't have any power to change some timeline, but you look at Nineveh and other cases in the Bible and history of big reprieves, show that there can be a bigger plan, other things can happen, and I think when you say a window, you mean like a Nineveh reprieve.
[02:12:28.886 --> 02:12:29.126]  Correct.
[02:12:29.426 --> 02:12:30.827]  So, like, you take Jonah.
[02:12:31.147 --> 02:12:32.028]  So here's Jonah.
[02:12:32.468 --> 02:12:34.669]  God tells him to go to Nineveh, and he doesn't want to go.
[02:12:34.929 --> 02:12:35.589]  So what does he do?
[02:12:35.709 --> 02:12:36.510]  He takes a cruise.
[02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:44.513]  So he's sitting on this boat, eating seafood, then all hell breaks loose, and guess who gets thrown overboard?
[02:12:44.633 --> 02:12:44.954]  Jonah.
[02:12:45.394 --> 02:12:46.654]  Now he becomes seafood.
[02:12:47.155 --> 02:12:48.495]  So this fish swallows him up.
[02:12:48.855 --> 02:12:52.777]  Now, he's inside the belly of the fish, now he's got to do some praying.
[02:12:52.797 --> 02:12:54.398]  Wouldn't you pray if you were in the belly of a fish?
[02:12:54.458 --> 02:12:55.679]  I'd be praying, you know what I mean?
[02:12:55.919 --> 02:12:58.060]  Because you know the way out is not the way you came in.
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:02.023]  Think about the process of being in a digestive system of a fish.
[02:13:02.823 --> 02:13:08.808]  So he's there for three days, he prays, he cries out, and the fish thankfully vomits him out.
[02:13:09.368 --> 02:13:12.771]  So no wonder when Jonah went to Nineveh and said, repent, they all repented.
[02:13:12.811 --> 02:13:14.392]  Said, look at this guy, he looks like crap.
[02:13:14.673 --> 02:13:15.213]  You know what I mean?
[02:13:15.513 --> 02:13:18.516]  So they all repented and the whole of Nineveh turned.
[02:13:19.016 --> 02:13:23.379]  Because Jonah went to go and obey God, ultimately, but he went through the belly of a fish.
[02:13:23.799 --> 02:13:25.760]  God doesn't want you to go through a belly of a fish.
[02:13:25.981 --> 02:13:27.141]  He just wants you to obey.
[02:13:27.642 --> 02:13:28.282]  Here's the thing.
[02:13:28.462 --> 02:13:33.385]  Not everybody's gonna stand in the church and preach like they do what I do, but everybody should be vocal.
[02:13:33.626 --> 02:13:34.186]  You gotta use...
[02:13:34.386 --> 02:13:34.606]  I think
[02:13:53.985 --> 02:14:00.069]  You've got this whole global government program, but the one thing it doesn't want you to be is Christian and speaking out and talking to other people.
[02:14:00.089 --> 02:14:05.172]  It wants you to just shut up and talk about Netflix and talk about all this stuff, but all of that is killing us.
[02:14:05.593 --> 02:14:07.994]  Totally, because it's distracting from the main point.
[02:14:08.334 --> 02:14:18.441]  The fact is, Matt, that what would happen if you're watching the program right now, but tonight, listen to me, you put your head on your pillow, and the middle of the night, you fall asleep and never wake up.
[02:14:19.041 --> 02:14:19.662]  Where are you going to go?
[02:14:20.768 --> 02:14:22.009]  Somebody said, well, I don't believe in that.
[02:14:22.290 --> 02:14:23.471]  Well, that's fine.
[02:14:23.972 --> 02:14:24.512]  But you know what?
[02:14:24.552 --> 02:14:28.917]  You don't want to be on the other side of that and then find out that you heard me talk along these lines.
[02:14:29.198 --> 02:14:37.227]  But if you study the globalists, they're obsessed with energy and spirits and the dimensions and that they're caught in this evil thing.
[02:14:37.487 --> 02:14:39.930]  They don't want us to go up to God.
[02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:41.632]  They want us to go down to them.
[02:14:41.752 --> 02:14:43.253]  And they're trying to become God.
[02:14:43.533 --> 02:14:44.354]  It's like the Tower of Babel.
[02:14:44.374 --> 02:14:46.115]  They're trying to build here on Earth.
[02:14:46.475 --> 02:14:46.856]  Exactly.
[02:14:46.896 --> 02:14:49.918]  They're trying to take genetics and saying, I don't believe in God yet.
[02:14:50.038 --> 02:14:50.838]  I'm going to be God.
[02:14:50.879 --> 02:14:51.899]  It's like the Tower of Babel.
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:59.465]  And why do the globalists all say, we have to have world government and exterminate humanity, and then the AI machines will let us merge with them.
[02:14:59.745 --> 02:15:01.886]  And even Elon Musk says he meets with all these billionaires.
[02:15:01.926 --> 02:15:02.307]  They all go.
[02:15:02.967 --> 02:15:08.032]  I worship the spirit, and it will be in the computer, and I will merge, and everyone else will die.
[02:15:08.052 --> 02:15:09.894]  And he's like, what kind of cult are you in?
[02:15:10.194 --> 02:15:12.076]  Why are you all saying we're going to kill everybody?
[02:15:12.496 --> 02:15:18.462]  Because there's some satanic, interdimensional force, whatever you want to call it, Satan, pushing through doing this.
[02:15:18.522 --> 02:15:25.709]  Yeah, well, you can just go to the Georgia Guidestones, what's directed right outside of Atlanta, the whole plan to reduce... Paid for by Ted Turner.
[02:15:26.449 --> 02:15:29.051]  Reduce the world's population to 500 million people.
[02:15:29.331 --> 02:15:30.932]  Because they feel like the world's overpopulated.
[02:15:30.953 --> 02:15:34.515]  Which, you know, that the scientists said we could have 10 billion people on the planet.
[02:15:34.535 --> 02:15:35.216]  Put them all in Texas.
[02:15:36.116 --> 02:15:39.199]  No, but we could have 10 billion people on the planet and would never get more than that.
[02:15:39.339 --> 02:15:43.502]  Just by death and birth, it would say of that... Well, it's already going to peak out, I think, at about 9 billion.
[02:15:43.582 --> 02:15:46.144]  Yeah, but God never put the Earth here to run out of anything.
[02:15:46.824 --> 02:15:47.084]  Never!
[02:15:47.785 --> 02:15:52.991]  And the Bible says, as long as the earth remains seethum and harvests day and night, summer and winter will not cease.
[02:15:53.391 --> 02:15:54.052]  Will not cease.
[02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:55.414]  That's in the Book of Genesis.
[02:15:56.155 --> 02:15:56.915]  We come back, though.
[02:15:56.935 --> 02:15:58.617]  The Mark of the Beast World Government System.
[02:15:58.737 --> 02:15:59.058]  It's here.
[02:15:59.078 --> 02:15:59.939]  We're going to break it down.
[02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:06.411]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.

[02:20:42.792 --> 02:20:50.058]  The killing of Uncle Sam.
[02:20:50.578 --> 02:20:57.303]  The demise of the United States of America.
[02:20:57.683 --> 02:20:58.824]  Must get booked.
[02:20:58.844 --> 02:20:59.945]  Start shipping out next week.
[02:21:00.005 --> 02:21:01.346]  Pre-order Infowars.com.
[02:21:02.006 --> 02:21:04.128]  Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown is here with us.
[02:21:05.646 --> 02:21:14.873]  During a four minute break last hour, you just really laid out the Mark of the Beast system and how the precursor is already here like no one else I've seen.
[02:21:15.554 --> 02:21:30.225]  And even if people don't believe in God, this system of control, imagine what a Stalin or a Hitler would have done with this and how they're already using the digital control and already harassing nationalists and Christians and patriots and persecuting the church.
[02:21:31.394 --> 02:21:31.814]  All of it!
[02:21:31.934 --> 02:21:33.155]  So lay that out for people.
[02:21:33.476 --> 02:21:34.877]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[02:21:34.917 --> 02:21:37.438]  I mean, obviously everything's about buying and selling.
[02:21:38.239 --> 02:21:45.844]  You take, the Bible says in the book of Ezekiel 28, talking about Lucifer, said you were the son of the morning.
[02:21:45.864 --> 02:21:53.890]  It says, you were perfect in every way till iniquity was found in you, and by the multitude your merchandise, and the iniquity of your traffic.
[02:21:54.210 --> 02:21:59.314]  So obviously he was doing something in heaven, and when he fell, he took a third of the angels with him.
[02:21:59.654 --> 02:22:04.898]  So, number one politician is Lucifer, and he knows everything to do with trade.
[02:22:05.438 --> 02:22:07.840]  That's why the Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil.
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:13.464]  So when he was thrown onto the earth, here's Adam, who's actually in charge of the whole planet, sells everything.
[02:22:13.484 --> 02:22:14.125]  Doesn't know it.
[02:22:14.445 --> 02:22:14.645]  No.
[02:22:15.286 --> 02:22:16.346]  Names all the animals.
[02:22:16.486 --> 02:22:18.788]  I mean, imagine the brain to name all the animals.
[02:22:19.228 --> 02:22:20.289]  Alex, unbelievable.
[02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:22.171]  Perfect in his generations.
[02:22:23.507 --> 02:22:25.708]  In everything, and could commune with God.
[02:22:25.809 --> 02:22:27.930]  And then he, Adam, loses everything.
[02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:30.111]  And so here, the devil's in control.
[02:22:30.151 --> 02:22:33.493]  What are the two areas that we are told, as Christians, we have to stay away from?
[02:22:33.834 --> 02:22:34.094]  Money.
[02:22:34.294 --> 02:22:35.134]  We shouldn't have any money.
[02:22:35.174 --> 02:22:35.875]  We should be poor.
[02:22:36.055 --> 02:22:38.076]  Which is a total lie, if you read the Bible.
[02:22:38.717 --> 02:22:40.398]  We're given dominion over the whole planet.
[02:22:41.078 --> 02:22:42.199]  It's all devilish tricks.
[02:22:42.459 --> 02:22:42.839]  Totally.
[02:22:43.319 --> 02:22:44.961]  And the other area is government.
[02:22:45.741 --> 02:22:48.323]  But Jesus is going to set up government, ultimately.
[02:22:48.343 --> 02:22:49.523]  We're going to rule and reign with Him.
[02:22:49.924 --> 02:22:51.605]  So we might as well practice down here.
[02:22:52.225 --> 02:22:56.888]  So, the fact of the matter is this, that people don't... They trick us into giving up our birthright.
[02:22:57.048 --> 02:22:57.388]  Totally.
[02:22:57.669 --> 02:23:05.174]  And then the Christians are just shoved down in the church on a Sunday, and you need to be quiet, you need to shut up, don't make a noise.
[02:23:05.354 --> 02:23:06.134]  Absolutely not.
[02:23:06.474 --> 02:23:11.097]  I can't preach on a Sunday when you're killing my people Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[02:23:11.438 --> 02:23:16.161]  And I'm not going to promise my people it's going to be okay just because we read the Bible and we pray.
[02:23:17.181 --> 02:23:20.424]  I tell you, we read the Bible, we pray, and God tells us to go do something.
[02:23:20.684 --> 02:23:23.626]  It's time for everybody to get up and kick butt and take names.
[02:23:23.947 --> 02:23:26.188]  It's time for people to get serious with what they believe.
[02:23:26.569 --> 02:23:28.130]  Stephen was stoned to death.
[02:23:28.450 --> 02:23:35.396]  I don't want to get to heaven and then have to tap Stephen on the shoulder and say, you're my hero, because you love Jesus more than me, and I was a chicken.
[02:23:35.896 --> 02:23:36.416]  No, I agree.
[02:23:36.456 --> 02:23:42.780]  We should be on the march, but so people understand our children, the smartphones, the social media is making them depressed.
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:46.302]  Everything that's deployed, the cancer rates, we're falling apart.
[02:23:46.622 --> 02:23:48.743]  You talk about China and its whole system and India.
[02:23:48.783 --> 02:23:51.584]  Get into the market of the beast, because this proves it's all real.
[02:23:51.704 --> 02:23:57.728]  So everything's coming to this buying and selling, which has to do with your power, your ability to buy.
[02:23:58.048 --> 02:24:03.851]  So if they start removing cash, people don't know there's only 7% of cash in circulation in America.
[02:24:03.951 --> 02:24:06.173]  Well, remember the one time Christ beat people, the money changers?
[02:24:06.554 --> 02:24:12.360]  They'd make you buy a special coin to buy your sacrifice, and they manipulated it, made you pay ten times what it was worth through scarcity.
[02:24:12.621 --> 02:24:18.867]  So it's showing they, through commerce, they make commerce your God, and get between you and God, and then rip you off.
[02:24:19.548 --> 02:24:22.572]  So Christ is like merchants ripping people off,
[02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:26.152]  That's why he flipped over the money change.
[02:24:26.212 --> 02:24:28.674]  Jesus actually beat the central bankers of the day.
[02:24:29.235 --> 02:24:33.078]  So here's what, in England there's only 4% of cash in circulation.
[02:24:33.398 --> 02:24:44.407]  So that's why they want to go to a total cashless society and then basically control you, monitor you through your social media, where you are, what you're eating, through your purchases, everything.
[02:24:45.174 --> 02:24:48.896]  And so basically, you know, people say, people say to me, well, I'll move to another country.
[02:24:48.936 --> 02:24:49.597]  I've got news for you.
[02:24:49.777 --> 02:24:51.098]  They'll watch you in another country.
[02:24:51.138 --> 02:24:53.860]  I've got friends in Australia on the big cattle stations.
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:58.162]  And he told me, I mean, I'm talking about where they're 40,000 head of cattle.
[02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:02.225]  I'm talking about a hundred, a million acres, a million acres.
[02:25:02.265 --> 02:25:08.269]  That's a huge, the father and sons leave the house and they don't get home for three months and they're only on their property.
[02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:09.089]  Can you imagine that?
[02:25:09.129 --> 02:25:10.290]  That's how big their property is.
[02:25:10.730 --> 02:25:13.892]  So they said, if we built something on here, we get a call from the government.
[02:25:14.053 --> 02:25:14.513]  What are you doing?
[02:25:14.873 --> 02:25:16.094]  Well how do you know I'm doing something?
[02:25:16.194 --> 02:25:18.295]  I'm like 20 hours by car from anywhere.
[02:25:18.495 --> 02:25:19.876]  They're watching by satellite.
[02:25:20.196 --> 02:25:20.757]  So guess what?
[02:25:21.137 --> 02:25:22.578]  You can run but you can't hide.
[02:25:22.598 --> 02:25:23.998]  It don't matter where you are.
[02:25:24.419 --> 02:25:25.099]  You'll get tracked.
[02:25:25.479 --> 02:25:27.140]  I've already talked to people.
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:28.481]  And you called it the noose tightening.
[02:25:28.501 --> 02:25:29.802]  What you said during that four minute break was...
[02:25:30.242 --> 02:25:46.232]  Yeah, the news is tightening, basically, to where you won't be able to move, do anything, because your cell phone's on, they can track wherever you are, what you're doing, they listen to you in your home with your television off, they can watch you in your home, they can listen to you on your device, they can switch your cameras on, they can record everything.
[02:25:46.272 --> 02:25:48.713]  I mean, basically we're in a surveillance state.
[02:25:48.813 --> 02:25:49.434]  It's 1984, and it's ubiquitous.
[02:25:54.096 --> 02:25:56.397]  My wife was saying the other day she mentioned something.
[02:25:56.737 --> 02:26:01.279]  My wife said she mentioned something and then she went to search for it and it popped right up in her search.
[02:26:01.619 --> 02:26:02.980]  She said my phone's listening.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:03.720]  Oh they admit that.
[02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:06.201]  That was the patent 12 years ago and now they're doing it.
[02:26:06.541 --> 02:26:11.643]  So we made the joke secretly here we would go talk about weird archaic stuff and a few hours later it was popping up.
[02:26:12.223 --> 02:26:15.624]  I mean it is just what they've done is so diabolical.
[02:26:15.644 --> 02:26:16.285]  So basically...
[02:26:17.065 --> 02:26:21.128]  Yeah, so basically, so... India already has a national ID to buy and sell.
[02:26:21.368 --> 02:26:23.069]  China has their, you're getting into it.
[02:26:23.109 --> 02:26:34.136]  China is also working on that whole thing with the national ID, plus they're putting a social score to people that if you don't meet the social score, they won't let you get on an airplane.
[02:26:34.456 --> 02:26:35.516]  You might never be able to fly.
[02:26:35.536 --> 02:26:37.458]  And it's already happening to journalists, so there it is.
[02:26:37.558 --> 02:26:39.499]  Buy nor sell, can't travel, can't live.
[02:26:39.539 --> 02:26:41.060]  You're putting an electronic go log.
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:43.441]  I mean, this is, this is, this is here!
[02:26:43.621 --> 02:26:44.382]  It's not coming!
[02:26:44.702 --> 02:26:45.463]  No, it's right here.
[02:26:45.503 --> 02:26:47.304]  So, here's the thing, we have a window.
[02:26:47.784 --> 02:26:55.229]  And if the church does not wake up, I'm talking about good people, all that has to happen for evil to prevail is for good people to do absolutely nothing.
[02:26:55.569 --> 02:27:00.333]  So when good people get up, and here's the thing, ask God what does he want you to do.
[02:27:00.833 --> 02:27:02.574]  Everybody can make a difference, come on.
[02:27:02.814 --> 02:27:04.976]  You don't have to do what I do or what Alex does.
[02:27:05.396 --> 02:27:09.197]  But you need to do it, and then those of you that are watching Alex right now.
[02:27:09.617 --> 02:27:12.398]  You know, some of you have received so much information.
[02:27:12.698 --> 02:27:14.559]  It's time for you to do something back to normal.
[02:27:14.579 --> 02:27:15.839]  And by the way, they all know that.
[02:27:15.859 --> 02:27:17.340]  They're awesome, but they're so humble.
[02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:20.380]  And I'm just, because they expect me to have to do this big, huge thing.
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:20.600]  No.
[02:27:20.901 --> 02:27:22.101]  Tell people about the website.
[02:27:22.581 --> 02:27:25.804]  People need to support you financially.
[02:27:26.244 --> 02:27:30.827]  Companies out there, patriots, you need to send something monthly.
[02:27:31.208 --> 02:27:34.030]  Say, Alex, here's a thousand dollars to help with the Infowars.
[02:27:34.270 --> 02:27:36.131]  It's imperative that you get behind.
[02:27:36.391 --> 02:27:40.554]  Because let me tell you, all those in the liberal agenda... They're all giving money.
[02:27:40.634 --> 02:27:41.415]  They're getting pumped.
[02:27:41.735 --> 02:27:42.876]  Millions of dollars.
[02:27:42.956 --> 02:27:46.239]  The Muslims reportedly give like a third of what they do to charity, but it's not charity.
[02:27:46.519 --> 02:27:47.720]  It's to big combines.
[02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:53.485]  Totally, to indoctrinate people, so it's imperative if I can... Why won't Christians give like the Muslims?
[02:27:55.046 --> 02:27:59.250]  Because, you know... They've been told, just go for a church for an hour and you're done.
[02:27:59.410 --> 02:28:00.031]  It's not that.
[02:28:00.331 --> 02:28:04.055]  You know, everything's been... And I'll tell you what, you know, because I deal with it.
[02:28:04.155 --> 02:28:06.997]  I teach people how to get blessed, because I believe in prosperity.
[02:28:07.318 --> 02:28:12.623]  I mean, there's people that can go excessive in anything... Well, it's beyond... At a gut level, it's not just the giving, it's the committing.
[02:28:13.243 --> 02:28:14.963]  Yeah, but... I mean, that is the committing.
[02:28:14.983 --> 02:28:17.544]  But I'm saying, isn't it just the willing to be good?
[02:28:17.704 --> 02:28:19.384]  Because people think what they have is theirs.
[02:28:19.404 --> 02:28:21.525]  They don't understand that they're stewards of what they have.
[02:28:21.825 --> 02:28:24.105]  So they think, look at my money, this is all my money.
[02:28:24.125 --> 02:28:24.765]  It's actually not.
[02:28:25.226 --> 02:28:26.566]  Everything you have comes from God.
[02:28:26.806 --> 02:28:31.107]  When a baby's born, it's not born with a briefcase with special documents giving it wealth.
[02:28:31.407 --> 02:28:32.467]  It comes out with nothing.
[02:28:32.747 --> 02:28:34.768]  And when you leave the earth, you leave with nothing.
[02:28:35.088 --> 02:28:35.868]  So we are stewards.
[02:28:35.888 --> 02:28:41.469]  Plus, I was going to say, don't they get they have to parlay the success that their ancestors gave them
[02:28:41.809 --> 02:28:44.633]  They have to continue that on now or they're going to lose it all.
[02:28:44.753 --> 02:28:50.520]  And I think it's the parents' job to teach the children the obligation back to help support the gospel of Christ.
[02:28:51.021 --> 02:28:53.905]  And even people that are watching this say, listen, we need to get behind Alex.
[02:28:54.145 --> 02:28:55.187]  Well, let's talk about it when we come back.
[02:28:55.247 --> 02:28:57.470]  I'm going to talk about the founding of Texas when we come back.
[02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:05.574]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[02:29:05.974 --> 02:29:11.121]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[02:29:11.802 --> 02:29:14.726]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[02:29:15.167 --> 02:29:18.691]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[02:29:19.292 --> 02:29:30.574]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[02:29:31.195 --> 02:29:41.937]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[02:29:42.257 --> 02:29:47.658]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.

[02:29:53.623 --> 02:29:58.908]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle, you're helping the fight for freedom.
[02:29:59.208 --> 02:30:00.570]  So please go to the site now.
[02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:02.632]  We need your support.
[02:30:03.172 --> 02:30:08.437]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWars Life.
[02:30:09.158 --> 02:30:12.441]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:30:13.281 --> 02:30:20.647]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:21.327 --> 02:30:27.692]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[02:30:28.492 --> 02:30:33.676]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:30:34.336 --> 02:30:52.664]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.
[02:30:53.444 --> 02:30:56.946]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.

[02:31:02.848 --> 02:31:09.850]  Every week we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[02:31:10.250 --> 02:31:16.652]  We're on well over a hundred stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[02:31:17.312 --> 02:31:23.134]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is Phonoscope.
[02:31:24.194 --> 02:31:30.956]  Phonoscope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 50, 60 years ago, streaming
[02:31:31.940 --> 02:31:33.421]  Television over phone lines.
[02:31:33.701 --> 02:31:35.883]  That's why it's called Phonoscope and why it's patented.
[02:31:36.363 --> 02:31:42.228]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[02:31:43.208 --> 02:31:47.632]  On Phonoscope, channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[02:31:48.212 --> 02:31:52.475]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[02:31:53.016 --> 02:31:54.257]  This is very, very exciting.
[02:31:54.357 --> 02:31:57.959]  So, to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:07.822]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to cable channel 9 to Phonoscope.
[02:32:08.182 --> 02:32:20.104]  Not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows, and all the other news, and anchors, and analysis that we're adding.
[02:32:20.544 --> 02:32:23.225]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[02:32:23.965 --> 02:32:27.708]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[02:32:27.728 --> 02:32:29.770]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:46.042]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune into Phonoscope and to also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[02:32:46.582 --> 02:32:46.943]  So again,
[02:32:47.423 --> 02:32:52.405]  For myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[02:32:52.925 --> 02:32:54.425]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[02:32:54.705 --> 02:32:56.266]  You've helped make America great again.
[02:32:57.746 --> 02:33:01.708]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:05.829 --> 02:33:08.470]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.685 --> 02:33:21.266]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:21.607 --> 02:33:27.932]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:42.684 --> 02:33:44.085]  Rodney Howard Brown's our guest.
[02:33:44.125 --> 02:33:45.125]  Amazing in studio.
[02:33:45.646 --> 02:33:47.848]  Always enjoy watching him on the internet, television.
[02:33:48.962 --> 02:33:54.334]  I wanted to get into what's happening in South Africa as the model of their control, but the Senate Intelligence Committee...
[02:33:55.748 --> 02:34:00.110]  They said this last night, but now it's official, has found Russian meddling on the side of Trump.
[02:34:00.770 --> 02:34:04.252]  Well, of course you can find bots that somebody bought in Russia to influence.
[02:34:04.332 --> 02:34:05.312]  Every country was involved.
[02:34:05.592 --> 02:34:08.914]  Like you said earlier, Pastor, Ukraine admittedly was on the side of Hillary.
[02:34:09.294 --> 02:34:13.716]  But this claim that Americans didn't elect Trump, they just keep beating this drum.
[02:34:14.396 --> 02:34:15.596]  Which is ridiculous.
[02:34:15.817 --> 02:34:18.578]  I mean, Russia had nothing to do with me going to the ballot box.
[02:34:19.458 --> 02:34:23.002]  And the same with all the patriots across the United States.
[02:34:23.723 --> 02:34:31.111]  So this is all just an attack that the left cannot get over the fact that they didn't get their candidate in.
[02:34:31.812 --> 02:34:34.615]  And that they got somebody in there who's actually... And I agree.
[02:34:34.695 --> 02:34:39.200]  So as everything they do fails, and as Trump turns the country around, what are they going to do?
[02:34:39.961 --> 02:34:41.002]  Well, it's going to get worse.
[02:34:41.122 --> 02:34:43.804]  I think we're going to just see crazy things happen, you know.
[02:34:44.385 --> 02:34:47.788]  It's just, you're seeing people act out of the ordinary.
[02:34:47.848 --> 02:34:51.191]  People going, they're going to the nth degree to try to stop.
[02:34:51.611 --> 02:34:56.975]  It's like a whole bunch of kids looking like you talked about the lady taking a dump in a coffee shop yesterday.
[02:34:57.216 --> 02:34:59.978]  So it's just, we're just going to expect to see more.
[02:34:59.998 --> 02:35:06.463]  By the way, insanity, mental illness, bizarre behavior is at every level way up in Western countries.
[02:35:07.004 --> 02:35:07.404]  What is it?
[02:35:07.444 --> 02:35:07.945]  What's happening?
[02:35:08.385 --> 02:35:10.526]  It's gone to the umpteenth level.
[02:35:10.566 --> 02:35:14.208]  You know, I think we've got a lot of people on all kinds of drugs.
[02:35:14.788 --> 02:35:19.831]  I mean, you see what's taking place even with the medical profession.
[02:35:20.191 --> 02:35:27.955]  I mean, you know as well as I do that many, many people are dying from malpractice, things that take place even in the hospital.
[02:35:28.275 --> 02:35:33.838]  You know, so, which, you know, I know doctors are trying to help people, but the whole of medical science has changed.
[02:35:34.438 --> 02:35:37.400]  Well, your book breaks down how the Rockefellers on record took control of it.
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:40.283]  Correct, of the American Medical Association.
[02:35:40.323 --> 02:35:44.588]  So, this is so important that people realize, you know, and again, let me just say this.
[02:35:44.648 --> 02:35:45.950]  I want to say this on air.
[02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:52.297]  I feel that you're going to have, and what will unveil here in the next year, will be a 24-hour news network.
[02:35:52.618 --> 02:35:53.499]  They'll be around the clock.
[02:35:53.999 --> 02:35:55.961]  And you'll have different people that will report.
[02:35:56.381 --> 02:36:02.166]  Plus, you're going to have reporters around the world, in the countries of the world, that will be Infowarriors, that will report.
[02:36:02.186 --> 02:36:03.247]  They'll do it as their hobby.
[02:36:03.587 --> 02:36:13.175]  And so daily, uploaded to Infowars, you're going to be getting all these headlines that'll come, and it'll not come through the mainstream media, AP, you know, Reuters.
[02:36:13.435 --> 02:36:14.837]  It's going to come straight to Infowars.
[02:36:15.137 --> 02:36:17.099]  And I just see this as a new... Oh, I like that!
[02:36:17.919 --> 02:36:24.042]  Because it's almost like they're accredited, we approve them, but they upload, we know who they are, it's there, then we put it into the live feed.
[02:36:24.323 --> 02:36:27.164]  That's pretty much what I've been trying to envision.
[02:36:27.224 --> 02:36:30.166]  So, in your mind's eye or in your spirit, what did you see, Pastor?
[02:36:30.366 --> 02:36:32.287]  I just feel that's what you're going to end up with, yeah.
[02:36:32.947 --> 02:36:39.211]  And I feel that's why I said earlier, there's people out there, there's people watching, Alex, that you have the means.
[02:36:39.431 --> 02:36:40.412]  I'm not trying to throw $100.
[02:36:41.512 --> 02:36:44.274]  You have the means to come and bring millions of dollars to the table.
[02:36:44.674 --> 02:36:48.537]  And you need to do it for the sake of America and for the sake of the nations of the earth.
[02:36:48.837 --> 02:36:53.860]  Well, I was about to say, I know just in Texas the amount of money there is, and I've never even really gone out and tried to get it myself.
[02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:56.662]  I've tried to self-fund, but as they try to shut us down, it becomes harder.
[02:36:57.282 --> 02:37:02.407]  And all these people know what's going on, but they think if they hoard more of the money, that somehow they're going to win.
[02:37:02.527 --> 02:37:03.448]  They're going to lose it all.
[02:37:03.648 --> 02:37:04.890]  Yeah, because they could collapse.
[02:37:06.011 --> 02:37:07.752]  They could shut down the dollar tomorrow.
[02:37:08.253 --> 02:37:11.116]  They could collapse Wall Street next Monday.
[02:37:11.756 --> 02:37:12.357]  And it's over.
[02:37:13.418 --> 02:37:16.341]  Well, the only real value is what you do spiritually, politically.
[02:37:16.882 --> 02:37:19.565]  You can say real estate as well, but they can try to take that.
[02:37:19.605 --> 02:37:23.109]  I mean, so many Christians and conservatives sit on the fence.
[02:37:23.149 --> 02:37:29.316]  They think that's safe in the spirit of stagnant behavior, but now you can see we're going over the waterfall.
[02:37:29.676 --> 02:37:31.237]  We're entering a big time of change.
[02:37:31.598 --> 02:37:31.978]  Totally.
[02:37:32.158 --> 02:37:38.343]  So I want to just say this again, you watching, you have a company, you have a corporation, and you are successful.
[02:37:38.643 --> 02:37:41.686]  Get behind the InfoWars you've received from Alex for years.
[02:37:41.946 --> 02:37:44.348]  You know you're awake, so we don't have to wake you.
[02:37:44.648 --> 02:37:50.573]  But take your money, put your money where your mouth is, and say, Alex, hey, well, let's help pay for all what you need in your studio.
[02:37:50.953 --> 02:37:55.016]  Let's help underwrite the satellite times of what you need to take this thing global.
[02:37:55.277 --> 02:37:58.419]  Let's help you build a whole network of information.
[02:37:58.439 --> 02:37:59.460]  Well, I'll say this, if we got
[02:37:59.540 --> 02:37:59.720]  I do.
[02:38:16.024 --> 02:38:24.630]  By the way, I do have contact with all those people, all the satellite companies, so I know all the things I can help you that they won't gouge you, because if you... Oh, I know!
[02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:30.293]  We got gouged a few years ago, and the satellite was so high-tech, the companies wouldn't even decode it on the ground.
[02:38:30.634 --> 02:38:33.856]  If you let an agency do it for you, the agency's doing it.
[02:38:33.896 --> 02:38:36.257]  They're not going to cut the price down to get you a deal.
[02:38:36.437 --> 02:38:37.038]  I know, we got screwed over.
[02:38:37.058 --> 02:38:39.219]  They're going to keep it high so they can get a greater commission.
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:40.880]  So let me help you with that.
[02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:42.381]  I know all these people.
[02:38:42.421 --> 02:38:43.022]  That's not a problem.
[02:38:44.062 --> 02:38:45.784]  The left loves to be in control.
[02:38:45.804 --> 02:38:48.207]  They don't do anything of the tech, of the companies.
[02:38:48.227 --> 02:38:50.129]  And as you said, thank you for your help.
[02:38:50.189 --> 02:38:53.993]  I appreciate you reaching out to us to help us because I admire the work you're doing.
[02:38:54.013 --> 02:38:59.980]  But the fact that you know all this, I've been through that, where the left is in these companies and they sabotage you through what they do.
[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:00.500]  Totally.
[02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:03.944]  Well, it comes through lawyers, CPAs.
[02:39:04.725 --> 02:39:06.527]  All of this stuff, I can write a book on it.
[02:39:07.047 --> 02:39:10.931]  You know, I can write a book on all the corruption, and I'm just talking about from the church standpoint.
[02:39:11.451 --> 02:39:15.515]  These Christian attorneys and Christian CPAs are going to help you, meanwhile they're setting you up for trouble.
[02:39:16.156 --> 02:39:19.019]  So that they can make money defending you at a later time.
[02:39:19.379 --> 02:39:21.841]  And they always act like you're stupid, you don't know what you're doing.
[02:39:22.382 --> 02:39:22.742]  But I...
[02:39:23.803 --> 02:39:24.564]  We're not stupid.
[02:39:25.244 --> 02:39:28.086]  Because you know in your spirit, you know something's wrong here.
[02:39:28.406 --> 02:39:31.307]  So that's what, I always work off of what my heart is telling me.
[02:39:31.648 --> 02:39:36.410]  So I'm not going to, you know, I'm not going to just believe what they say because, oh well that's... The point is we're not just on air.
[02:39:36.470 --> 02:39:38.011]  People think, oh they're on air fighting this.
[02:39:38.071 --> 02:39:38.271]  No.
[02:39:38.632 --> 02:39:41.573]  The whole system wants to shut this down to shut your voices up.
[02:39:41.813 --> 02:39:42.194]  Totally.
[02:39:42.574 --> 02:39:49.298]  So, but you've got information through books, through films, all your films, Alex, people watch those things all the time.
[02:39:49.898 --> 02:39:50.759]  I need to make more films.
[02:39:51.379 --> 02:39:52.380]  Just we get, but now...
[02:39:53.453 --> 02:39:55.335]  It does seem like a big film, a big event.
[02:39:55.355 --> 02:39:56.436]  They have trouble censoring it.
[02:39:56.476 --> 02:39:58.638]  The constant news we put out, they're trying to block it.
[02:39:58.658 --> 02:40:01.420]  Let me ask you this, because I've been asking a lot of the questions, Pastor Brown.
[02:40:02.441 --> 02:40:09.627]  Gut level, in the age of the earth and in God's plan, you talk about a reprieve, just in your mind's eye.
[02:40:09.928 --> 02:40:18.455]  I know you don't want to say exactly, because you don't want to be up there like you have all the answers, but at a spiritual level, a sermon level, how long has the planet got left?
[02:40:19.256 --> 02:40:20.137]  I mean, I know we have it from a
[02:40:20.717 --> 02:40:25.520]  Christian perspective from the Bible, which I think is 100% accurate, but in a modern context, the devil.
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:33.845]  I mean, it sounds like some interdimensional creature here trying to enslave us, and God gave us creation and life, and God's trying to warn us, but we have free will.
[02:40:34.225 --> 02:40:39.649]  So if this con artist wants to, you know, trick us into getting the white truck with him, the white van, God will let us do that.
[02:40:40.769 --> 02:40:41.910]  I'm not saying God's a sadist.
[02:40:41.970 --> 02:40:44.872]  I totally get God's spirit, but free will, man.
[02:40:45.092 --> 02:40:47.534]  I mean, I guess God just... He's waiting on us.
[02:40:48.134 --> 02:40:49.195]  He's actually waiting on us.
[02:40:49.915 --> 02:40:52.336]  Jesus said, when I come back will I find faith on the earth.
[02:40:52.696 --> 02:40:53.776]  So he's waiting on us.
[02:40:54.257 --> 02:41:01.839]  In every generation, down through the centuries, there have been men and women that stood up, Wilberforce and others, that made a difference for their generation.
[02:41:02.179 --> 02:41:05.120]  How would you have liked to live in England in the middle of the 1700s?
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:06.341]  Are you kidding me?
[02:41:06.761 --> 02:41:10.022]  I mean, imagine, I travel today, we can get on a plane, fly around the world.
[02:41:10.162 --> 02:41:14.523]  They had to take three months to go and navigate, and it was crazy.
[02:41:14.563 --> 02:41:22.906]  So we're living in the greatest hour, with the greatest technology, to get the greatest message out to a lost and dying world, and the enemy was arrogant.
[02:41:23.286 --> 02:41:25.608]  I thought, oh, Christian conservatives, you'll never beat us.
[02:41:25.628 --> 02:41:27.189]  We've got the big money and the slick systems.
[02:41:27.470 --> 02:41:31.373]  But we use the Internet, and all the world are defeating them now.
[02:41:31.453 --> 02:41:32.414]  It's Gideon's army.
[02:41:32.634 --> 02:41:34.215]  It's the whole thing of Gideon's army, just 300.
[02:41:35.016 --> 02:41:35.816]  It's Gideon's army.
[02:41:36.357 --> 02:41:37.398]  We don't need that many.
[02:41:37.658 --> 02:41:39.540]  It's a David coming against Goliath.
[02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:40.821]  Who could ever believe that?
[02:41:41.081 --> 02:41:44.223]  So don't buy the narrative that there's nothing we could do.
[02:41:44.484 --> 02:41:48.147]  Because a lot of Christians are just waiting, well, I know the Lord will come one day, take me out.
[02:41:48.687 --> 02:41:48.967]  No!
[02:41:49.467 --> 02:41:50.148]  It's up to us!
[02:41:50.388 --> 02:42:07.116]  I know if Patriots went to every Democrat Congress event, Senate event, and just exposed Comey's a fraud, Russiagate's a fraud, Bill Clinton's a rapist, Infowars.com, web censorship's happening, that buzz scares them so much if people just everywhere went and did it themselves.
[02:42:07.216 --> 02:42:08.917]  But there's people that have to get involved.
[02:42:09.217 --> 02:42:11.398]  People need to get involved in the school board district.
[02:42:11.478 --> 02:42:13.619]  People need to get involved on the county.
[02:42:13.919 --> 02:42:17.541]  They need to get involved in local government, because all government is actually local.
[02:42:17.801 --> 02:42:19.602]  That's, you know, that has grown.
[02:42:19.842 --> 02:42:23.244]  So you need to make a difference in your town, in your village, in your city.
[02:42:23.564 --> 02:42:24.785]  And you need to get radical.
[02:42:24.825 --> 02:42:29.267]  You need to get on fire for... By the way, people think it's like work to go out and fight corruption.
[02:42:29.667 --> 02:42:30.948]  When you go out, it's fun.
[02:42:30.988 --> 02:42:31.808]  You meet new people.
[02:42:31.888 --> 02:42:32.548]  It's exhilarating.
[02:42:32.568 --> 02:42:33.509]  You're supposed to be doing that.
[02:42:33.709 --> 02:42:39.873]  Listen, I'll tell you what, the greatest joy you're going to get is by helping other people and bringing them out of their condition where they are.
[02:42:40.153 --> 02:42:45.476]  You can't sit by and just watch this thing come and then do nothing and just, well, one day we'll all go to heaven.
[02:42:45.756 --> 02:42:46.757]  No, we're here on the earth.
[02:42:47.057 --> 02:42:48.498]  It's time for us to do something.
[02:42:48.778 --> 02:42:50.359]  It's time for us to get with the program.
[02:42:50.699 --> 02:42:56.162]  Because if you're not conscious of all the tech and the soul-stealing stuff, you're going to give in to it.
[02:42:56.182 --> 02:42:58.003]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:42:58.344 --> 02:42:58.944]  Stay with us.
[02:42:59.144 --> 02:43:00.285]  Doug Hagman takes over.
[02:43:02.412 --> 02:43:11.417]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:11.497 --> 02:43:19.561]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:19.881 --> 02:43:24.603]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:24.763 --> 02:43:31.506]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:31.566 --> 02:43:38.628]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:38.728 --> 02:43:45.591]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:45.751 --> 02:43:50.114]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:50.234 --> 02:43:53.496]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:53.616 --> 02:43:59.760]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:01.882]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:44:16.156 --> 02:44:16.923]  Here's what you wanna know.
[02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:23.853]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:44:24.513 --> 02:44:28.074]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:44:28.935 --> 02:44:36.958]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:44:37.518 --> 02:44:45.202]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:44:45.982 --> 02:44:49.771]  It's got the best of ancient science, with the latest developments as well.
[02:44:50.372 --> 02:44:54.302]  It's Alpha Power, and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:44:55.380 --> 02:45:10.244]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:45:10.644 --> 02:45:16.005]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:45:16.306 --> 02:45:17.846]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[02:45:18.166 --> 02:45:19.487]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[02:45:19.507 --> 02:45:24.111]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpapower, because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[02:45:24.651 --> 02:45:28.954]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:45:28.974 --> 02:45:30.335]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:45:31.136 --> 02:45:38.381]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[02:45:38.401 --> 02:45:39.822]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:45:40.403 --> 02:45:43.365]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:45:43.425 --> 02:45:45.006]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:45:45.046 --> 02:45:47.188]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[02:45:47.728 --> 02:45:48.569]  But here's an example.
[02:45:49.389 --> 02:45:56.996]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:45:57.016 --> 02:45:58.698]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:45:59.198 --> 02:46:05.363]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:46:06.044 --> 02:46:11.131]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:46:11.431 --> 02:46:19.762]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:46:20.182 --> 02:46:21.204]  Nobody else does that.
[02:46:21.284 --> 02:46:23.947]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:46:24.448 --> 02:46:40.599]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:46:41.019 --> 02:46:49.966]  So you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[02:46:50.326 --> 02:46:52.348]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:46:52.728 --> 02:46:58.012]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:46:58.032 --> 02:46:58.472]  A total 360 win.
[02:46:58.713 --> 02:47:00.094]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.244 --> 02:47:20.266]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:47:20.366 --> 02:47:22.470]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:34.591 --> 02:47:38.633]  You know, there's a saying that there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:47:39.393 --> 02:47:43.695]  And I've had very powerful spiritual experiences in my life.
[02:47:44.395 --> 02:47:48.177]  And the more I've studied the globalists and their whole operations, they're now very honest about it.
[02:47:48.217 --> 02:47:49.258]  They are Luciferians.
[02:47:49.778 --> 02:47:56.301]  When you get to the top of the world, George Soros and his son are in photos at Aleister Crowley events.
[02:47:57.041 --> 02:47:58.782]  His son, every week there's new photos.
[02:47:58.842 --> 02:48:00.163]  It's like he lives at these things.
[02:48:00.203 --> 02:48:03.104]  Spirit cooking, all this really evil stuff.
[02:48:04.369 --> 02:48:08.052]  And then, I've noticed most of the atheists at the high level aren't really atheists.
[02:48:08.072 --> 02:48:11.475]  They just don't want you to know there's a God there so they can feed on you.
[02:48:11.495 --> 02:48:23.045]  I know you're all about positive stuff, Pastor Brown, but speaking to what the devil would do if he gets full control and we don't stand up, if this psychotic evil force in the universe.
[02:48:23.186 --> 02:48:24.767]  Well, he wants to destroy everybody.
[02:48:24.807 --> 02:48:28.250]  We can see that from the killing of all the babies, you know.
[02:48:28.590 --> 02:48:29.871]  So the babies are not even
[02:48:30.942 --> 02:48:32.023]  Safe in their mother's womb.
[02:48:32.103 --> 02:48:35.524]  And Silicon Valley says, we've got to kill everybody, then we become gods.
[02:48:36.244 --> 02:48:36.925]  Yeah.
[02:48:37.005 --> 02:48:49.330]  Then the plundering of the children, from the pedophilia, all the way through the bombardment of the kids through primary school, through high school, and then by the time your kid gets to university, he's not even the child that you even knew.
[02:48:49.410 --> 02:48:52.031]  You question yourself, how did my kid go wrong?
[02:48:52.051 --> 02:48:57.513]  So they're trying to block people from finding God by controlling the churches, putting drugs in the water, the food.
[02:48:57.533 --> 02:48:58.334]  Controlling the narrative.
[02:48:58.874 --> 02:49:06.700]  Control the narrative, and spend... Make people victims of anything good, like Western civilization, free market, God.
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:07.661]  Oh, that's abusive.
[02:49:07.681 --> 02:49:08.341]  You don't want that.
[02:49:08.462 --> 02:49:09.983]  Yeah, because He wants to destroy you.
[02:49:10.303 --> 02:49:14.746]  So the Bible says that the thief cometh but for the steel, kill and destroy.
[02:49:15.007 --> 02:49:19.030]  But Jesus said, I'm come that you might have life, and you might have it more abundantly.
[02:49:19.310 --> 02:49:23.633]  So this is what's so important, that we, that everybody does something, you know.
[02:49:23.673 --> 02:49:24.114]  And by the way,
[02:49:24.594 --> 02:49:27.735]  Every place in the world where there are Christians, there is prosperity.
[02:49:27.795 --> 02:49:29.276]  Right across the line, there's not.
[02:49:29.516 --> 02:49:29.856]  Totally.
[02:49:29.956 --> 02:49:39.720]  Even across Africa, where I come from, every country that has been the poverty stricken is because they worship ancestors, they worship idols, and you can see it.
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:47.062]  You go to the nations, you go to Haiti, you see what's going on, the voodoo, and you go to Madagascar, where people worship their ancestors.
[02:49:47.162 --> 02:49:51.284]  Every year they bring their mother and father, they dig them up, or their grandparents, and walk
[02:49:51.644 --> 02:49:55.887]  Their bodies around the city to show them the new happenings of what's taking place.
[02:49:56.407 --> 02:49:58.388]  So it's a whole, it's a whole nother level.
[02:49:58.749 --> 02:50:05.993]  I mean in India, India has 300 million gods and obviously now India, India's received the gospel and India's rising.
[02:50:06.033 --> 02:50:08.195]  There are more millionaires there than anywhere else in the world.
[02:50:08.515 --> 02:50:12.017]  So India's seeing a whole reformation take place in India.
[02:50:12.037 --> 02:50:15.039]  In actual fact, I think it shocked the globalists of what's happening in India.
[02:50:15.359 --> 02:50:17.321]  And I've read a lot of that's Christianity driving it.
[02:50:17.361 --> 02:50:18.161]  Totally, totally.
[02:50:18.201 --> 02:50:20.323]  I mean, there's huge churches and people that come.
[02:50:20.623 --> 02:50:21.424]  It's the gospel.
[02:50:21.484 --> 02:50:22.185]  It's the light.
[02:50:22.625 --> 02:50:29.010]  It's the light of the gospel and connected to God and the Holy Spirit that's giving people creativity and people inventions.
[02:50:29.090 --> 02:50:35.315]  And you can see what happened in America coming out of the first Great Awakening in the 1700s and the second one in the 1800s.
[02:50:35.636 --> 02:50:37.397]  And we need another Great Spiritual Awakening.
[02:50:37.417 --> 02:50:39.379]  Well, it's like the Reformation led the Renaissance.
[02:50:39.699 --> 02:50:40.039]  Totally.
[02:50:40.379 --> 02:50:42.920]  So we need another great spiritual awakening in America.
[02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:52.182]  So where you saw all those kids marching for, you know, anti-guns and that, the day will come when those kids will be packing the streets and they're going to be marching for King Jesus.
[02:50:52.622 --> 02:50:53.562]  I believe that with all my heart.
[02:50:54.063 --> 02:50:56.083]  And I feel that we've got this window.
[02:50:56.443 --> 02:50:58.704]  God has granted us a last-minute reprieve.
[02:50:59.004 --> 02:50:59.824]  It's not over yet.
[02:50:59.844 --> 02:51:03.605]  Because let me tell you, back in 07, I said to the Lord, tell me, is it too late?
[02:51:04.125 --> 02:51:05.285]  I mean, it's 07.08.
[02:51:05.365 --> 02:51:05.846]  Is it too late?
[02:51:06.126 --> 02:51:07.726]  I'll tell the people, because I'm on the line to them.
[02:51:07.786 --> 02:51:17.189]  I'll tell them, hey, it's over, and put yourself in the brace position, like they tell you on the aircraft, which is not a good thing, because that means you're trying to get your head as close to your butt as you can.
[02:51:17.209 --> 02:51:18.129]  Put your head between your knees.
[02:51:18.269 --> 02:51:19.790]  You can kiss it goodbye, you know.
[02:51:19.810 --> 02:51:21.230]  It's like, we're going down, you know.
[02:51:21.630 --> 02:51:24.031]  So, no, the Lord said to me, it's not too late.
[02:51:24.551 --> 02:51:25.972]  And God is waiting on us.
[02:51:26.253 --> 02:51:27.494]  He's waiting on us to stand up.
[02:51:27.854 --> 02:51:31.497]  And I want to just say this, you know, I feel the Lord's hand of protection is on you.
[02:51:31.858 --> 02:51:33.719]  If they were going to take you out, they would have taken you out.
[02:51:33.739 --> 02:51:41.326]  They're not going to touch you, because of the blood of Jesus that protects you, the angels of God that encamp about you, your wife, your children, and everything that you touch.
[02:51:41.606 --> 02:51:43.268]  So don't, don't get frustrated.
[02:51:43.308 --> 02:51:46.951]  Know that the Lord, there's a God in heaven, and you know, He's about you.
[02:51:46.971 --> 02:51:48.793]  He said, I'll be about you as a wall of fire.
[02:51:48.853 --> 02:51:49.554]  He told me that.
[02:51:49.574 --> 02:51:49.914]  I feel it.
[02:51:50.134 --> 02:51:50.274]  Yeah.
[02:51:50.294 --> 02:51:51.634]  I just don't feel like I'm doing good enough.
[02:51:51.694 --> 02:51:52.055]  No, no.
[02:51:52.375 --> 02:51:53.475]  Alex, it's not about that.
[02:51:53.495 --> 02:51:54.315]  You're doing your best.
[02:51:54.615 --> 02:51:55.215]  Here's the thing.
[02:51:55.295 --> 02:51:56.876]  Everybody must do what they can.
[02:51:57.136 --> 02:51:58.496]  Everybody does their best.
[02:51:58.796 --> 02:52:01.837]  And at the end of the day, God takes our best and he multiplies it.
[02:52:01.857 --> 02:52:02.137]  Oh, I know.
[02:52:02.157 --> 02:52:03.138]  I can feel God's strength.
[02:52:03.658 --> 02:52:05.318]  I just can't believe that other people don't see it.
[02:52:05.538 --> 02:52:10.620]  Yeah, but that's why I'm going to preach the gospel to them so that they can experience the power of the Holy Spirit.
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.400]  Because it's the Holy Spirit that will... Well, it's like you said.
[02:52:13.420 --> 02:52:14.921]  We've got to get glorified bodies.
[02:52:14.941 --> 02:52:15.561]  You would feel God.
[02:52:16.301 --> 02:52:18.141]  Ultimately, we'll get there.
[02:52:18.361 --> 02:52:20.062]  We don't have it at this juncture.
[02:52:20.082 --> 02:52:23.822]  But just the edges of it, it's so big, it's like there's no energy even like it.
[02:52:23.842 --> 02:52:25.063]  That's why people don't even know.
[02:52:25.223 --> 02:52:26.203]  No, there's nothing like it.
[02:52:26.563 --> 02:52:30.644]  So I want to say this, you know, people, you've been attacked like I've been attacked.
[02:52:30.964 --> 02:52:32.304]  But I look beyond all of that.
[02:52:32.384 --> 02:52:36.205]  I see, I said, that man, God is using him to wake people up.
[02:52:36.625 --> 02:52:40.085]  And that's why I said, I said to my wife, I want to help Alex somehow.
[02:52:40.145 --> 02:52:41.706]  That's why I sent the books and all that.
[02:52:41.766 --> 02:52:44.006]  I come here, I actually brought a gift for you today.
[02:52:44.386 --> 02:52:49.369]  Well, let me just say, Pastor Rodney, I feel in the spirit strongly when I listen to you, but in person I feel it.
[02:52:49.609 --> 02:52:50.310]  Makes you feel good.
[02:52:50.610 --> 02:52:51.710]  Well, we're praying for you.
[02:52:52.011 --> 02:52:53.051]  Our church is praying for you.
[02:52:53.391 --> 02:52:54.672]  And you keep up the good work.
[02:52:55.113 --> 02:52:58.254]  And don't, don't, don't, don't, don't even react.
[02:52:58.294 --> 02:53:03.638]  Because my first reaction when I was under attack was I would react to all the bullies and I would get up and whatever.
[02:53:03.658 --> 02:53:05.799]  Well, my listeners have said they're sick of hearing about the attacks.
[02:53:06.159 --> 02:53:07.480]  Not that they don't want to know about it.
[02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:08.260]  They just, they don't care.
[02:53:08.281 --> 02:53:09.081]  They're going to support us.
[02:53:09.401 --> 02:53:10.722]  I just can't believe what liars they are.
[02:53:10.782 --> 02:53:18.926]  Yeah, but the best thing to do is get one of your other staff to make up a 10-minute clip on all what's going on, and then you just come in, get the InfoWars, and then you don't have to deal with it.
[02:53:18.966 --> 02:53:21.307]  Because I deal with... Listen, let me tell you.
[02:53:22.988 --> 02:53:23.849]  I get angry.
[02:53:23.949 --> 02:53:25.530]  You know, you do get angry.
[02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:27.951]  The Bible says, actually, be angry and sin not.
[02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:29.672]  Do you want me to give you the gift?
[02:53:29.992 --> 02:53:30.292]  Sure.
[02:53:30.372 --> 02:53:31.333]  Okay, so I collect 45s.
[02:53:32.333 --> 02:53:34.536]  So I was given this .45, specially made.
[02:53:34.877 --> 02:53:36.939]  This is from the United States Submarine Force.
[02:53:37.260 --> 02:53:38.001]  Pride runs deep.
[02:53:38.061 --> 02:53:39.202]  It's actually serial numbered.
[02:53:39.563 --> 02:53:41.045]  And I wanted to bring you a gift today.
[02:53:41.225 --> 02:53:42.707]  Well, you said to me earlier, I'm very honored.
[02:53:42.747 --> 02:53:43.067]  Thank you.
[02:53:43.128 --> 02:53:45.110]  I know it's unloaded here, but... On the air.
[02:53:45.511 --> 02:53:45.891]  Amazing.
[02:53:45.911 --> 02:53:47.493]  Let's get the document camera shot on this thing.
[02:53:47.594 --> 02:53:48.415]  A preacher's gift.
[02:53:48.955 --> 02:53:50.696]  Giving Alex Jones a .45.
[02:53:50.856 --> 02:53:52.718]  Silent Service Dolphin Code.
[02:53:52.858 --> 02:53:55.079]  And then it's got the double sabers here.
[02:53:55.099 --> 02:53:55.880]  Well, God bless you.
[02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:56.100]  Thank you.
[02:53:56.120 --> 02:53:56.800]  It's a beautiful .45.
[02:53:57.200 --> 02:53:58.201]  I can't wait to shoot it.
[02:53:59.002 --> 02:54:00.723]  Submarine Force Zero One Two.
[02:54:00.783 --> 02:54:01.423]  Thank you, sir.
[02:54:01.543 --> 02:54:03.425]  I can't wait till the media put that headline up.
[02:54:03.705 --> 02:54:05.466]  Preacher Brings Alex Jones .45.
[02:54:05.806 --> 02:54:07.507]  That's the headline for the mainstream media.
[02:54:07.847 --> 02:54:08.368]  It's beautiful.
[02:54:08.868 --> 02:54:10.489]  So, you feel the action on it.
[02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:12.630]  Just feel that action on it.
[02:54:12.931 --> 02:54:14.111]  I know, it's very nice.
[02:54:14.832 --> 02:54:15.472]  Oh my goodness.
[02:54:15.492 --> 02:54:16.253]  Yeah, it's beautiful.
[02:54:16.413 --> 02:54:17.594]  And the trigger pull, everything.
[02:54:18.254 --> 02:54:20.316]  Well, next time you come back, I think we've got to catch a plane soon.
[02:54:20.336 --> 02:54:21.056]  We've got to go shooting.
[02:54:21.657 --> 02:54:22.577]  Oh, we definitely.
[02:54:23.178 --> 02:54:23.338]  Yeah.
[02:54:23.558 --> 02:54:25.760]  So, you know, I saw the gun clubs in churches.
[02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:26.861]  I know, I know.
[02:54:27.061 --> 02:54:28.362]  I've seen the news, they demonize you.
[02:54:28.562 --> 02:54:31.645]  But that's one place we're also winning, is the Second Amendment.
[02:54:31.665 --> 02:54:32.385]  Is this tangible?
[02:54:32.425 --> 02:54:32.986]  We can feel it.
[02:54:33.246 --> 02:54:36.008]  Because if they take the Second Amendment, we lose the First Amendment.
[02:54:36.369 --> 02:54:37.429]  So somebody said, shut up.
[02:54:37.529 --> 02:54:39.131]  Well, come down and make me shut up.
[02:54:40.333 --> 02:54:45.617]  Because the Founding Fathers didn't put the Second Amendment there so we could protect our house or go duck hunting.
[02:54:46.077 --> 02:54:50.881]  The Founding Fathers put the Second Amendment there so we could protect ourselves from a tyrannical government.
[02:54:51.041 --> 02:54:51.281]  That's right.
[02:54:51.301 --> 02:54:53.303]  It's there to defend the first, the fourth, everything.
[02:54:53.403 --> 02:54:53.943]  And guess what?
[02:54:54.244 --> 02:54:56.866]  They made me swear to defend the Constitution, Alex.
[02:54:57.768 --> 02:54:59.609]  So, they should never have made me a citizen.
[02:55:00.370 --> 02:55:03.572]  As long as I was a green card holder, then everything was okay.
[02:55:03.812 --> 02:55:09.975]  But the moment they, the moment I raised my hand, to say, I pledge to defend the Constitution, that was in America, you got me.
[02:55:10.396 --> 02:55:12.237]  So, the Lord is with you, my friend.
[02:55:14.301 --> 02:55:15.182]  Oh, believe me, I can feel it.
[02:55:15.282 --> 02:55:15.802]  He's with you.
[02:55:16.443 --> 02:55:21.387]  And he will help you through all the storms, all these attacks, even lawsuits, they will come unraveled.
[02:55:21.887 --> 02:55:26.651]  And you know, look what's happening, even they try to, it's like everybody that comes against Trump, something happens to them.
[02:55:26.731 --> 02:55:29.253]  I'm saying, it's like an unseen hand is dealing with them.
[02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:32.161]  So people think... That's already happened with most of the lawsuits.
[02:55:32.241 --> 02:55:32.582]  Totally.
[02:55:32.962 --> 02:55:34.763]  But I'm talking about even with our president.
[02:55:34.843 --> 02:55:35.583]  No, that's happened, yeah.
[02:55:35.603 --> 02:55:40.827]  So we're praying for him and God will bring him through as long as he stays humble and just cries out to God, which he is.
[02:55:41.187 --> 02:55:42.407]  I believe he's calling out to the Lord.
[02:55:42.427 --> 02:55:44.429]  Well, you can see that he said he's changed, too.
[02:55:44.489 --> 02:55:45.089]  Nobody's perfect.
[02:55:45.389 --> 02:55:47.410]  But he's stronger and stronger.
[02:55:47.791 --> 02:55:51.533]  And I know, as he's told me the times I've talked to him, that, you know, he talks about God.
[02:55:51.573 --> 02:55:52.153]  He really feels it.
[02:55:52.173 --> 02:55:53.914]  But we didn't elect a Sunday school teacher.
[02:55:54.375 --> 02:55:56.016]  We elected a wrecking ball.
[02:55:56.792 --> 02:55:57.592]  And that's all we've got.
[02:55:57.813 --> 02:56:00.934]  So if he ever hears this, wreck on, Mr. President.
[02:56:01.014 --> 02:56:01.515]  Wreck on.
[02:56:01.915 --> 02:56:02.635]  We're behind you.
[02:56:03.756 --> 02:56:04.076]  I agree.
[02:56:04.096 --> 02:56:16.482]  You know, speaking of providence or serendipity, synchronicity, Doug Hagman is friends with your co-author, and then this was all, he only hosts like every two or three weeks, but he happens to be hosting today, and your co-author is coming up today, Paul L. Williams.
[02:56:16.502 --> 02:56:17.123]  So that'll be good.
[02:56:17.143 --> 02:56:17.403]  Correct.
[02:56:17.483 --> 02:56:21.345]  And they're great friends, and I've actually been on Doug Hagman's show, so that's... I know, I've seen it.
[02:56:21.425 --> 02:56:22.586]  It's all just working out great.
[02:56:23.444 --> 02:56:28.950]  Well, we're trying to get more board ops and more producers hired so we can do a daily show with Doug and with other co-hosts with him.
[02:56:28.970 --> 02:56:31.392]  So that's what we're trying to do in the future here.
[02:56:31.573 --> 02:56:37.859]  But just separately, the nastiness of Hollywood, you know, the hatred of just how unhappy they are.
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:40.502]  Wouldn't it be nice if the leaders of Hollywood found Christ?
[02:56:40.522 --> 02:56:41.843]  Maybe we should pray for them.
[02:56:42.124 --> 02:56:45.667]  I think there's a lot of people in Hollywood that are
[02:56:46.468 --> 02:56:49.529]  If you really knew what was going on, they're not in agreement.
[02:56:49.569 --> 02:56:52.090]  Oh yeah, most of them don't like it, they're bullied into it.
[02:56:52.130 --> 02:56:52.450]  Correct.
[02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:55.271]  So it's going to cost them their future career.
[02:56:55.751 --> 02:57:03.073]  So I think, wouldn't it be great if we had other alternatives for Hollywood actors to make movies that was outside of this.
[02:57:03.093 --> 02:57:06.674]  Well here's the thing, since the awakening happened, people even 10 years ago still liked Hollywood.
[02:57:07.054 --> 02:57:08.215]  Almost no one likes it.
[02:57:08.555 --> 02:57:11.976]  If I have Hollywood people on, even if they're good people, people don't like it.
[02:57:12.256 --> 02:57:13.738]  A pastor on like you, they love it.
[02:57:14.038 --> 02:57:15.299]  People hate the system.
[02:57:16.301 --> 02:57:20.685]  I'm saying Hollywood has only now begun to figure out, like you said, it's being propped up by government.
[02:57:20.906 --> 02:57:21.326]  It's gone.
[02:57:21.546 --> 02:57:26.612]  But what, you know, not only with the 24-hour news network, what if you have your own film studio, Alex?
[02:57:26.792 --> 02:57:29.695]  By the way, all the main grossing ones are Christian films now.
[02:57:29.976 --> 02:57:30.156]  Sure.
[02:57:31.477 --> 02:57:31.697]  Wow.
[02:57:32.398 --> 02:57:36.801]  The book is The Killing of Uncle Sam, co-written with Paul L. Williams and Rodney Howard Brown.
[02:57:37.261 --> 02:57:38.101]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:57:38.121 --> 02:57:45.506]  We're back in two minutes and we're going to just say hi to Doug Hagman real quick, then we'll punch out of here and let him continue on with your co-author, Paul L. Williams.
[02:57:45.826 --> 02:57:47.227]  Get the book at Infoworkstore.com.
[02:57:47.667 --> 02:57:50.549]  But regardless, just keep praying for the broadcast and sending out the links.
[02:57:50.829 --> 02:57:51.350]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:52.662 --> 02:58:02.034]  I was talking to Sam in Texas, who came into the ATX, this experience of wearing an InfoWars shirt, and they were very hateful to it.
[02:58:02.495 --> 02:58:11.006]  Man, I walked into the Starbucks on South Lamar in my InfoWars t-shirt, and let me tell ya, I was the only InfoWarrior in the place.
[02:58:11.730 --> 02:58:17.515]  We make a point to be polite, to tip well, to say please and thank you, hold doors for people.
[02:58:17.755 --> 02:58:21.338]  But you guys experience a lot of hatred and I just appreciate you.
[02:58:21.378 --> 02:58:23.159]  I commend you for holding up under that.
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:25.661]  It's an honor to do it because these are weak people.
[02:58:25.681 --> 02:58:26.862]  We have to stand strong on our face.
[02:58:26.902 --> 02:58:30.005]  But yeah, living here in Austin is quite interesting now.
[02:58:30.385 --> 02:58:38.071]  I got a really nice Infowars May the Truth Be With You black t-shirt and I wear it a lot of places and I get commendations too.
[02:58:40.082 --> 02:58:41.563]  People commend me for wearing it.
[02:58:41.603 --> 02:58:52.426]  They kind of have a look in their eye that, man, it takes some cajones to stand up to the persecution and to tell people what we really believe and where we really stand.
[02:58:52.626 --> 02:58:54.686]  But it's nothing new in Christianity.
[02:58:55.226 --> 02:59:04.069]  So yes, I walked into Starbucks today and every person, every person takes a sidelong look at that shirt.
[02:59:05.529 --> 02:59:16.738]  And it's so sad, all we're trying to do is free market, freedom, everything that we know works, and they're just brainwashed by big corporations that think of them as morons like Jeff Bezos.
[02:59:33.129 --> 02:59:37.491]  It's very frustrating, and I just wish that I could deprogram them, but, you know?
[02:59:37.791 --> 02:59:45.515]  And actually, I enjoy being at the grocery store and having somebody come over and scream and cuss at me only every once in a while, you know, and every 50th person that goes by.
[02:59:45.955 --> 02:59:49.997]  And I know that I'm upsetting them because I'm challenging their whole system.
[02:59:55.020 --> 03:00:00.923]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.609 --> 03:00:13.470]  You want answers?
[03:00:13.490 --> 03:00:15.571]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:15.731 --> 03:00:18.273]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.313 --> 03:00:27.040]  Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown's been our amazing guest the last two hours, and it just worked out that his co-author, Paul L. Williams, is coming up in about six minutes after this first little segment.
[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:32.424]  But I know Doug Hagman's a fan of the work you do, Pastor, and so I want to get you guys a chance to talk here for a few minutes.
[03:00:32.444 --> 03:00:33.425]  But it just comes down to this.
[03:00:33.805 --> 03:00:39.129]  There are evil forces in the world that want to dominate the entire continuum of humanity.
[03:00:39.169 --> 03:00:39.890]  They want to end it.
[03:00:39.930 --> 03:00:41.031]  They want to take control of it.
[03:00:41.491 --> 03:00:42.472]  That's not God's plan.
[03:00:42.512 --> 03:00:43.913]  God's plan is milk and honey.
[03:00:43.953 --> 03:00:44.774]  It's everything good.
[03:00:44.794 --> 03:00:46.856]  And people can see that now.
[03:00:47.276 --> 03:00:48.917]  And so this is quite a time to be alive.
[03:00:48.957 --> 03:00:51.580]  But Doug, just say hi to your pastor friend here.
[03:00:54.602 --> 03:00:57.445]  I'll tell you, what a fascinating couple of hours.
[03:00:58.105 --> 03:00:58.926]  Incredible stuff.
[03:00:59.426 --> 03:01:01.648]  Hey Doug, it's great to see you, as always.
[03:01:02.149 --> 03:01:05.632]  And I know you're going to have my dear friend on shortly, Paul Williams.
[03:01:06.958 --> 03:01:07.578]  Absolutely.
[03:01:08.579 --> 03:01:10.880]  I'll tell you what, your book is fantastic.
[03:01:11.460 --> 03:01:13.941]  I would urge everyone to get it via InfoWars store.
[03:01:15.082 --> 03:01:16.822]  It's an incredible read.
[03:01:17.003 --> 03:01:18.603]  You and Dr. Williams did a great job on that.
[03:01:19.143 --> 03:01:24.706]  As well as, what's coming up, and we've never broken this before, I don't believe publicly,
[03:01:25.266 --> 03:01:38.490]  We're going to be talking about the Islamic infiltration via the Islamic training compounds and show some, I don't, some of these photographs I don't think we ever saw the light of day of the surveillance that we did of these Islamic training compounds.
[03:01:38.510 --> 03:01:41.491]  So looking forward to that, but it's always great to see you Pastor.
[03:01:41.651 --> 03:01:43.432]  Great to see you too, and keep up the good work.
[03:01:44.488 --> 03:01:50.249]  Just briefly before you guys break all that down, what do you make of the New York Times confirming illegal spying on Trump?
[03:01:50.609 --> 03:01:54.550]  Sounds like they know Trump's ready to release this stuff and Mueller's in a lot of trouble.
[03:01:54.570 --> 03:02:04.993]  And you've got Giuliani saying, you better give up right now, let me find the exact quote, you better give up right now or we're ready to rip you apart if you want us to.
[03:02:06.781 --> 03:02:08.262]  You know, we've been talking about this, Alex.
[03:02:08.302 --> 03:02:11.183]  We've been talking about this for weeks, if not months.
[03:02:11.843 --> 03:02:16.064]  Look, this was a setup, a sting operation of Donald Trump that went awry.
[03:02:16.084 --> 03:02:34.731]  Of course, Deep State, this whole thing, and you're right, they are about right now to, Donald Trump is striking back, is fighting back, and we are, we, the media, the honest media, is exposing everything that they've done, exposing the setup, the entrapment, exposing the Deep State,
[03:02:35.451 --> 03:02:37.172]  Alright, well that's all coming up.
[03:02:37.192 --> 03:02:38.593]  We've got about two minutes to break.
[03:02:38.613 --> 03:02:40.554]  Doug Hagman, go ahead and take over.
[03:02:40.574 --> 03:02:41.614]  Thank you.
[03:02:59.904 --> 03:03:02.305]  Alright, thanks Alex, I really appreciate it.
[03:03:02.365 --> 03:03:24.850]  Yeah, folks, look, what is taking place right now, in terms of the exposure of what has taken place with respect to McCabe, you've heard of that, and Comey on his book tour, and the Mueller, the larger Mueller investigation, all of this is about to fall apart, be crumbled, or be shattered.
[03:03:25.090 --> 03:03:25.670]  It's up to them.
[03:03:26.410 --> 03:03:28.551]  It's amazing to me how we can
[03:03:29.772 --> 03:03:43.716]  Haweke have gone nearly 500 days of a Donald Trump presidency, about 370 some days, roughly, or 300 some odd days, well, close to a year, I guess, of the Mueller investigation.
[03:03:44.016 --> 03:03:45.276]  Mueller finding nothing.
[03:03:45.416 --> 03:03:52.678]  And yet, yet, the continuation of this probe, which is highly illegal, most assuredly.
[03:03:53.496 --> 03:04:12.062]  The question is, are we going to see justice brought to people like Comey, McCabe, ultimately, all of the individuals responsible for this crossfire hurricane, all of the individuals responsible for the illegal and illicit spying operations?
[03:04:12.082 --> 03:04:14.303]  Are we going to see justice brought to these people?
[03:04:14.863 --> 03:04:21.505]  Is the OIG report that's being really tossed out, is the savior of things?
[03:04:22.426 --> 03:04:27.252]  Is that OIG report merely going to expose the criminality or is it going to have some teeth to it?
[03:04:27.272 --> 03:04:28.153]  And that's what we're looking at.
[03:04:28.433 --> 03:04:37.845]  I have a feeling if we don't see teeth to that report, if we don't see indictments, if we don't see justice, then my prediction is we're going to see blood in the streets of America.
[03:04:38.606 --> 03:04:40.249]  Because Americans are sick and tired of
[03:04:40.929 --> 03:04:42.010]  This dual justice system.
[03:04:43.131 --> 03:04:44.372]  And that's where we're at today.
[03:04:44.893 --> 03:04:49.977]  So, coming up, exposing much of the deep state by way of the CIA operations.
[03:04:49.997 --> 03:04:51.158]  Dr. Paul Williams coming up.
[03:04:51.399 --> 03:04:56.323]  A great segue or a great follow-up to Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown.
[03:04:57.844 --> 03:04:58.265]  Stay with us.
[03:04:58.285 --> 03:04:59.245]  You're listening to Infowars.
[03:04:59.666 --> 03:05:00.727]  Infowars.com.
[03:05:00.767 --> 03:05:01.808]  Doug Hagman sending in for Alex.
[03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:09.204]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[03:05:09.945 --> 03:05:13.247]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:05:14.088 --> 03:05:20.353]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:05:22.134 --> 03:05:28.478]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[03:05:35.143 --> 03:05:43.869]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including...
[03:05:52.154 --> 03:05:53.475]  Tribulus from India.

[03:06:20.740 --> 03:06:26.822]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones, hosting the fourth hour of InfoWars.com.
[03:06:26.842 --> 03:06:28.462]  That's the website to go.
[03:06:28.963 --> 03:06:32.704]  My website, of course, is HagmanReport.com, but happy to host the fourth hour.
[03:06:33.144 --> 03:06:41.347]  Before bringing on Dr. Paul Williams, which will come up in the next segment, talking about the... giving you some inside information in terms of the Islamic infiltration.
[03:06:41.387 --> 03:06:42.547]  Before getting to that,
[03:06:43.768 --> 03:06:51.580]  What a great show today by the way Alex Jones and Pastor Rodney Howard Brown and of course all of the information preceding that and all the great shows throughout the week.
[03:06:51.620 --> 03:06:56.888]  But here's something that I want to mention before getting into how bad the Islamic infiltration is.
[03:06:58.264 --> 03:07:01.466]  The issue of censorship, we've been talking about this.
[03:07:01.646 --> 03:07:05.487]  I've been talking about this on this platform and my platform.
[03:07:06.068 --> 03:07:23.656]  The issue of censorship on social media, the lawfare being waged against InfoWars, the celebratory kind of environment that I see on social media about the attacks against Alex Jones, the attacks against InfoWars, the attacks against the honest media.
[03:07:24.489 --> 03:07:25.650]  What's this all about?
[03:07:25.810 --> 03:07:46.986]  Well, to the people, and I'm going to just be blunt here, there are tiny puny minuscule minds out there who are, some people are intellectually bankrupt when they go after platforms such as InfoWars, when they go after our platform, when they go after the people in the alternative media.
[03:07:47.827 --> 03:07:52.951]  But don't you find it a little odd that as we see the exposure
[03:07:53.909 --> 03:07:58.773]  of the illegal, illicit spying operations against Donald Trump.
[03:07:58.933 --> 03:08:04.657]  As the exposure heightens, so does the censorship wars.
[03:08:05.572 --> 03:08:07.874]  Do you see any correlation there?
[03:08:08.054 --> 03:08:09.976]  I do.
[03:08:10.196 --> 03:08:29.814]  The more that we expose the enemies of nationalism, the enemies of making America great again, the more we expose the enemies who are out there attempting to silence the truth about what's really taking place behind the curtain, behind the veil and behind the scenes, the greater the censorship.
[03:08:30.579 --> 03:08:32.240]  And we've been talking about this.
[03:08:32.520 --> 03:08:33.501]  We are under attack.
[03:08:33.601 --> 03:08:35.322]  Alex Jones and Infowars is under attack.
[03:08:35.342 --> 03:08:38.284]  Many in the alternative media are under attack.
[03:08:38.904 --> 03:08:44.908]  And I find it pretty, not just disingenuous, but pretty intellectually dishonest.
[03:08:45.428 --> 03:08:50.031]  When you've got people out there on Twitter, on Facebook, it's like, yeah, shut them down.
[03:08:50.051 --> 03:08:53.713]  Yeah, the peddlers and purveyors of fake news.
[03:08:54.941 --> 03:09:21.464]  Well, when you start looking at the backgrounds of the people who are carrying that torch to have InfoWars shut down and to have our program shut down, you start looking at the backgrounds, you start looking at their agenda, you'll see close ties in many cases, not all, but many cases, between the people who are anti-exposure to the misdeeds, the criminal activity of the Clintons and of the Bushes and the Globalists and, you know, the usual parties.
[03:09:22.589 --> 03:09:34.298]  And the more we expose, of course, the greater the censorship calls are, and the more personal they become, and the more insidious they become.
[03:09:34.878 --> 03:09:50.190]  So here's my message to you, to those people who are celebrating the fact that, oh, yeah, look at this, this is the demise of the alternative media, people in the alternative media, and I don't care if it's InfoWars, you know, or Hagman Report, or whatever, it doesn't matter.
[03:09:51.371 --> 03:09:55.877]  To the people who are celebratory in that environment, you're next.
[03:09:56.538 --> 03:09:58.200]  Whether you know it or not, you're next.
[03:09:58.921 --> 03:10:01.504]  Because if they can do it to us, they will do it to you.
[03:10:01.945 --> 03:10:07.172]  And it's the objectionable content, the content that they cannot counter with facts.
[03:10:08.234 --> 03:10:10.536]  That's the problem to them, you see.
[03:10:10.676 --> 03:10:13.017]  So, they can't counter with facts?
[03:10:13.418 --> 03:10:13.558]  No.
[03:10:13.878 --> 03:10:15.259]  They've got to pull the plug.
[03:10:15.619 --> 03:10:20.923]  And I've said this before, and we're seeing this being heightened, and the censorship increased.
[03:10:20.963 --> 03:10:23.104]  So, that's what I want you to consider.
[03:10:23.344 --> 03:10:37.234]  So, the next time that you, in this, again, in this radically elated fashion, want to pile on, the dog pile, and say, well, you know what, it's fake news, it's all fake news, and shut them down.
[03:10:37.819 --> 03:10:38.260]  It's OK.
[03:10:38.740 --> 03:10:42.985]  Think about what you're doing, because again, this is not what it seems to be.
[03:10:43.385 --> 03:10:48.211]  And it's it's it's there is a causation there.
[03:10:48.691 --> 03:10:52.936]  The more that we bring out, of course, the greater the calls for censorship.
[03:10:53.096 --> 03:10:57.241]  So, again, this is something that I think people really need to look at.
[03:10:58.360 --> 03:11:06.182]  From an evidentiary standpoint, when you again, when you're calling for the shutdown of alternative media, it's just it's just ridiculous.
[03:11:06.723 --> 03:11:09.423]  But it's ridiculously evil as well.
[03:11:09.664 --> 03:11:11.244]  And it's it's got agenda behind it.
[03:11:12.304 --> 03:11:14.365]  So again, that's that's where we're at now.
[03:11:14.385 --> 03:11:16.706]  You know, it's interesting because we're waiting for the
[03:11:18.544 --> 03:11:22.026]  The Inspector General's report, Michael Horowitz's report, John Huber's report.
[03:11:22.507 --> 03:11:23.568]  We're waiting for that to come out.
[03:11:23.588 --> 03:11:29.972]  We're seeing this offensive move by Rudy Giuliani, of course, one of Donald Trump's lawyers.
[03:11:30.012 --> 03:11:37.397]  We're seeing all of this pushback against the deep state by the Trump team against the fake news that is coming out.
[03:11:38.538 --> 03:11:46.023]  And we're watching the, really, the special counsel Robert Mueller just
[03:11:47.006 --> 03:11:47.306]  I don't know.
[03:12:07.848 --> 03:12:28.168]  And in this article, he does talk about what is taking place today, what is taking place behind the scenes with the Trump-Russia investigation, how the name came about, the crossfire hurricane, and one of the sentences in here, and I love this particular citation here,
[03:12:31.465 --> 03:12:37.950]  Now consider this, and the reason I bring that up, I like the writing style, but I bring this up because consider the fact that we had a weaponized Department of Justice and FBI.
[03:12:53.983 --> 03:13:01.949]  Insert human assets into the Trump campaign, into a political opponent's campaign.
[03:13:02.890 --> 03:13:05.452]  And I ask you, in what world is this right?
[03:13:05.872 --> 03:13:06.813]  In what country?
[03:13:06.853 --> 03:13:08.234]  This is the United States of America.
[03:13:08.274 --> 03:13:10.076]  This is not some banana republic.
[03:13:11.096 --> 03:13:15.280]  Well, it is after, of course, the legacy of Obama.
[03:13:16.060 --> 03:13:20.704]  And that's what this, that's what the legacy of Obama's legacy will be.
[03:13:20.944 --> 03:13:23.546]  It's a legacy of division, a legacy of criminality.
[03:13:24.455 --> 03:13:26.637]  A legacy of corruption.
[03:13:27.798 --> 03:13:43.970]  And we are seeing this come out, and we are seeing that there was absolutely no criminal predicate, as we've been saying, for the investigators, whether the Department of Justice or FBI, to launch an investigation, either a counterintelligence or a criminal investigation, into the Donald Trump campaign.
[03:13:44.411 --> 03:13:49.635]  There was no Russian collusion proven or sufficient to rise to the level.
[03:13:50.482 --> 03:13:50.902]  All right.
[03:14:08.583 --> 03:14:10.826]  Uh, did not open a criminal investigation.
[03:14:10.846 --> 03:14:13.509]  Instead, the Bureau opened a counterintelligence investigation.
[03:14:13.549 --> 03:14:25.522]  And that's what I really, if you could take nothing else away from this segment, understand that the counterintelligence department of the FBI, DOJ,
[03:14:26.613 --> 03:14:34.554]  The investigation hid behind the counterintelligence of the FBI DOJ.
[03:14:35.095 --> 03:14:43.116]  Instead of a criminal investigation, which has more transparency, they went the deep, dark, secret route, and that's a counterintelligence investigation.
[03:14:44.016 --> 03:14:53.378]  That lady, Sally Yates, the woman that operated the Deputy Attorney General,
[03:14:54.521 --> 03:15:04.829]  Disallowed any investigative oversight, including the oversight by the Inspector General, of course, creating a wall that walls off the Counterintelligence Bureau.
[03:15:07.348 --> 03:15:10.930]  That walls off the Counterintelligence Bureau from the Inspector General's office.
[03:15:11.130 --> 03:15:19.334]  So, everything that they did, they did in secret, they did in the dark, and of course, without any kind of oversight.
[03:15:19.454 --> 03:15:32.280]  So what we're about to see from the Inspector General, from Michael Horowitz, is a glimpse into the criminality, the extent of the criminality, and the level of criminality conducted by this previous administration.
[03:15:32.340 --> 03:15:34.641]  By the way, it's Obamagate!
[03:15:35.061 --> 03:15:36.162]  It's Clintongate!
[03:15:37.148 --> 03:15:52.731]  It's not just Comeygate, it is Obamagate, because this exists directly at the feet of Barack Hussein Obama, in my view, the Marxist Muslim who occupied the White House for eight years, and what we are seeing is the legacy now breaking down.
[03:15:52.871 --> 03:15:54.412]  Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:15:54.452 --> 03:15:57.392]  Visit Infowars.com, Infowars store.
[03:15:57.953 --> 03:15:59.073]  Hey, support this broadcast.
[03:15:59.293 --> 03:15:59.873]  It'll break back.
[03:16:00.173 --> 03:16:00.473]  Stay with us.
[03:16:09.480 --> 03:16:12.402]  What do you wanna do with your life?
[03:16:13.122 --> 03:16:13.923]  I wanna rock!
[03:16:17.025 --> 03:16:22.028]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[03:16:22.048 --> 03:16:28.452]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[03:16:34.022 --> 03:16:38.464]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[03:16:39.604 --> 03:16:45.366]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[03:16:45.986 --> 03:16:54.850]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[03:16:54.870 --> 03:16:57.951]  All right, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[03:16:59.090 --> 03:17:01.952]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[03:17:02.052 --> 03:17:10.476]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[03:17:10.497 --> 03:17:16.020]  To work to erase national boundaries and create an international community.
[03:17:16.500 --> 03:17:21.643]  And, in time, bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[03:17:22.977 --> 03:17:39.743]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[03:17:40.003 --> 03:17:46.586]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[03:17:46.946 --> 03:17:48.067]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[03:17:48.308 --> 03:17:52.953]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[03:17:53.073 --> 03:17:57.698]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[03:17:58.609 --> 03:18:03.272]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[03:18:03.572 --> 03:18:07.735]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[03:18:07.795 --> 03:18:10.557]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[03:18:10.637 --> 03:18:18.162]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[03:18:18.462 --> 03:18:22.785]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[03:18:23.085 --> 03:18:28.409]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[03:18:29.490 --> 03:18:30.671]  I'm scared of these people.
[03:18:31.332 --> 03:18:34.735]  I'm very scared of them.
[03:18:34.795 --> 03:18:40.780]  How do you think the crack drop gets into the country?
[03:18:40.800 --> 03:18:42.202]  We don't own any planes.
[03:18:42.662 --> 03:18:43.763]  We don't own no ships.
[03:18:44.003 --> 03:18:47.346]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[03:18:47.607 --> 03:18:54.293]  I will tell you, Director Deutch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[03:18:56.617 --> 03:19:03.840]  Men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[03:19:03.860 --> 03:19:08.842]  My boss goes on a fish and chip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[03:19:08.902 --> 03:19:15.924]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[03:19:16.384 --> 03:19:23.227]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-controvers
[03:19:23.747 --> 03:19:28.950]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:35.653]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[03:19:36.254 --> 03:19:41.256]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[03:19:41.456 --> 03:19:44.638]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[03:19:45.158 --> 03:19:47.860]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[03:19:48.520 --> 03:19:52.782]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[03:19:52.842 --> 03:19:53.742]  Lewinsky.
[03:19:53.762 --> 03:19:55.603]  These allegations are false.
[03:19:56.504 --> 03:20:02.486]  If you are resuming this transition, you are in the resistance.
[03:20:06.168 --> 03:20:08.809]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:35.980 --> 03:20:37.874]  She just ain't always...
[03:20:47.842 --> 03:20:51.483]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones, hour number four, InfoWars.
[03:20:51.603 --> 03:20:52.783]  InfoWars.com.
[03:20:52.803 --> 03:20:54.564]  Visit the InfoWars store, by the way.
[03:20:54.684 --> 03:20:58.105]  There you can find a number of things to support the operation.
[03:20:58.145 --> 03:21:06.327]  Look, it costs money to operate a radio studio, a television studio costs money to fund this operation.
[03:21:06.367 --> 03:21:07.528]  So help fund this operation.
[03:21:07.548 --> 03:21:10.368]  Visit InfoWars.com.
[03:21:10.988 --> 03:21:16.030]  There, I can talk, there you can find the killing of Uncle Sam, of course, Dr.
[03:21:17.070 --> 03:21:23.774]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown was on with Alex Jones earlier in the show talking about a number of issues.
[03:21:23.934 --> 03:21:26.635]  Extremely important, of course, the killing of Uncle Sam.
[03:21:27.336 --> 03:21:30.998]  His co-author, I was able to twist his arm to get him to join me.
[03:21:31.078 --> 03:21:38.041]  His co-author, a good friend of mine, Dr. Paul L. Williams, the co-author of the killing of Uncle Sam.
[03:21:39.362 --> 03:21:43.124]  Also, the author of The Day of Islam, which I've got a copy right here.
[03:21:43.164 --> 03:21:46.306]  This happens to be an advanced copy of The Day of Islam.
[03:21:46.326 --> 03:21:59.553]  The reason I asked Dr. Williams to join me today is to get into something that perhaps you've heard about, but you're not, you weren't sure, not sure about the validity or the authenticity of the information.
[03:22:00.513 --> 03:22:08.294]  And that is, of course, the discussion of paramilitary training compounds, Islamic paramilitary training compounds, present here in the United States.
[03:22:09.175 --> 03:22:16.736]  It was about, I don't know, about, I think it was 2005, 2006, when I met Dr. Paul Williams up in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
[03:22:17.236 --> 03:22:27.178]  Had a meeting with him and we had just had a tremendously fruitful meeting and we shared some notes, investigative notes.
[03:22:27.578 --> 03:22:28.358]  Subsequent to that,
[03:22:29.125 --> 03:22:37.271]  We had investigated and conducted investigation into the paramilitary training compounds, the Islamic paramilitary training compounds here in America.
[03:22:37.951 --> 03:22:47.778]  So having said all of that, I asked Dr. Ronnie Howard-Browns, his co-author Paul Williams, to join me for this segment and the subsequent segments.
[03:22:48.398 --> 03:22:49.399]  Paul, thanks for joining me.
[03:22:50.809 --> 03:22:57.277]  First of all, my good friend Doug, you didn't have to twist my arm when I heard a call from Doug Hagman.
[03:22:57.598 --> 03:22:59.019]  I immediately responded.
[03:22:59.039 --> 03:23:00.061]  We go back too far.
[03:23:00.541 --> 03:23:04.807]  We have too much history and too many fatwas behind us.
[03:23:06.168 --> 03:23:22.336]  I mean, we are bound together as brothers, so it's just delightful to be on your program, delightful to be on InfoWars, delightful to follow my great friend Dr. Rodney Howard Brown, and yeah, let's talk about what we both discovered in New York.
[03:23:26.639 --> 03:23:27.520]  Well, indeed.
[03:23:27.780 --> 03:23:31.483]  And of course, we're not going to rehash the previous segments.
[03:23:31.543 --> 03:23:38.328]  Of course, you can go back to the segments and listen to Alex and Dr. Brown talk about the killing of Uncle Sam.
[03:23:38.809 --> 03:23:51.178]  But part and parcel to that, of course, the demise of the attacks from within America are the presence of these Islamic training compounds all across the United States.
[03:23:51.699 --> 03:23:52.299]  And Dr. Williams,
[03:23:53.640 --> 03:24:15.265]  I conducted a pretty lengthy surveillance back in 2000 and I was in the 2000s post 9-11 and followed that up back just a few years ago of these Islamic training compounds that are formed under what is known as the Muslims of the Americas, Jamaat al-Fuqra and Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jilani.
[03:24:15.465 --> 03:24:18.386]  And of course you write extensively about that in your book The Day of Islam.
[03:24:19.372 --> 03:24:24.315]  And you yourself have been conducting investigations on these compounds.
[03:24:25.115 --> 03:24:26.556]  I gotta ask, what'd you find, brother?
[03:24:27.957 --> 03:24:30.318]  First of all, let me tell you how I found the compounds.
[03:24:31.699 --> 03:24:36.721]  I went to Northeast Intelligence Network and I saw this report.
[03:24:37.342 --> 03:24:41.324]  This is going back maybe about two or three years after 9-11.
[03:24:41.424 --> 03:24:47.407]  And it was a report by Doug Hagman on a place called Islamberg.
[03:24:48.928 --> 03:25:00.937]  Let me state this emphatically, because there are a lot of people who say, oh, you know, we've done so much investigations into Jamal al-Fuqra and into Jelani and into Islamberg.
[03:25:01.218 --> 03:25:02.519]  I've heard them on Fox News.
[03:25:02.999 --> 03:25:07.142]  I've heard them on different networks, a lot of Christian broadcasts.
[03:25:07.422 --> 03:25:09.904]  A lot of these people say, oh, we've stumbled on this.
[03:25:09.924 --> 03:25:09.964]  No.
[03:25:11.355 --> 03:25:20.961]  Islamberg and the other compounds throughout the United States, and there are about 35 of them, the settlements were discovered by Doug Hagman.
[03:25:21.541 --> 03:25:24.843]  I mean, credit must go where credit is due.
[03:25:25.364 --> 03:25:27.345]  It was one of the bravest reports.
[03:25:27.945 --> 03:25:29.966]  I ran a newspaper for many years.
[03:25:29.986 --> 03:25:31.547]  I've written 15 books.
[03:25:33.469 --> 03:25:40.713]  And I've written for major newspapers, every probably major newspaper in the country, worked with some very, very
[03:25:41.639 --> 03:25:43.500]  Excellent investigative reporters.
[03:25:44.521 --> 03:25:53.408]  That story on Islamberg was one of the finest, maybe the best example of investigative reporting I've ever seen.
[03:25:54.128 --> 03:26:05.617]  And after reading that, and then I found out it was in Hancock, New York, Doug's findings, and he took the photographs, and among his photographs were photographs of
[03:26:07.225 --> 03:26:09.026]  The firing range there.
[03:26:09.086 --> 03:26:13.287]  And on the firing range, they were firing at school buses.
[03:26:14.608 --> 03:26:18.529]  And the school buses were riddled with machine gun bullets.
[03:26:19.149 --> 03:26:24.651]  And Doug found also that there were obstacle courses there.
[03:26:26.252 --> 03:26:33.835]  And what I did was I went up to Islamberg myself just to find out what, in fact, was going on following his report.
[03:26:34.695 --> 03:26:36.716]  And I went up there several times.
[03:26:36.756 --> 03:26:39.118]  I would say at least half a dozen.
[03:26:39.878 --> 03:26:41.679]  And I followed Doug's lead.
[03:26:42.239 --> 03:26:52.825]  I went into Islamberg in the outer parameters, and I saw the firing ranges, and I photographed them myself, as Doug had done.
[03:26:53.665 --> 03:26:55.366]  I discovered underground bunkers there.
[03:26:56.272 --> 03:27:12.257]  I had discovered, I talked to, there's a sentry, and Doug, you can tell the people this as well, there's a sentry post at the entranceway to Islamberg, and the guard there had a semi-automatic weapon when I was there.
[03:27:12.897 --> 03:27:18.099]  And he stopped us, and he was very friendly though, but you know, you weren't allowed to go any further.
[03:27:18.799 --> 03:27:25.601]  And Islam, by the way, is very close to the main reservoir that serves New York City.
[03:27:27.262 --> 03:27:44.378]  And to your point about the sentry, and just so people understand, I conducted with, well my team conducted, myself and my team, we conducted a surveillance for, I don't know, probably four or five months.
[03:27:45.018 --> 03:27:49.380]  And it covered from the winter months to into the spring and into the summer.
[03:27:49.901 --> 03:27:51.441]  And this is again post 9-11.
[03:27:52.002 --> 03:28:02.507]  And what we're talking about are these compounds, one in particular, the headquarters of Jamaal al-Fuqar located in Hancock, New York, as you stated, and as you've written about in the Day of Islam.
[03:28:03.127 --> 03:28:18.236]  The leader, of course, is Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani from Pakistan, and if that name sounds familiar, that is the guy that Daniel Pearl was scheduled to meet, and was kidnapped, never did meet him, and was ultimately beheaded, the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.
[03:28:18.636 --> 03:28:21.978]  Dr. Williams, you've got about 30 seconds left to go in this segment.
[03:28:22.618 --> 03:28:31.503]  Yeah, let's tell the people, first of all, like you said, you were there in the winter, and people have to realize that this is a very, very, it's a place
[03:28:32.083 --> 03:28:35.784]  Between Hancock and DuPaz in New York on Ruth's Creek Road.
[03:28:36.164 --> 03:28:37.565]  And you're going up a dirt road.
[03:28:37.945 --> 03:28:43.407]  And you're going into a very thickly forested area where there's a lot of wildlife.
[03:28:44.647 --> 03:28:48.488]  Where the people live in a very, very, very rural setting.
[03:28:48.888 --> 03:28:51.049]  And I have been there in the winter.
[03:28:51.069 --> 03:28:52.550]  Dr. Lewis, hold that thought.
[03:28:52.570 --> 03:28:53.070]  Hold that thought.
[03:28:53.090 --> 03:28:53.790]  We're up against a break.
[03:28:53.810 --> 03:28:54.210]  Hold that thought.
[03:28:54.230 --> 03:28:55.150]  We're up against a break.
[03:28:55.170 --> 03:28:58.171]  Yeah, you've got to bring your waders or boots in the wintertime.
[03:28:58.251 --> 03:29:00.192]  InfoWars, Dr. Paul Lewis, we'll be right back.
[03:29:05.418 --> 03:29:06.818]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[03:29:06.878 --> 03:29:08.319]  Victor, you're calling.
[03:29:08.359 --> 03:29:08.739]  Go ahead.
[03:29:08.839 --> 03:29:09.119]  Yes.
[03:29:09.559 --> 03:29:10.279]  Hi, Alex.
[03:29:10.379 --> 03:29:16.580]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[03:29:16.800 --> 03:29:20.761]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[03:29:21.001 --> 03:29:22.461]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[03:29:22.821 --> 03:29:32.463]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[03:29:33.344 --> 03:29:38.047]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[03:29:38.087 --> 03:29:45.913]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[03:29:45.933 --> 03:29:51.777]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[03:29:51.897 --> 03:29:57.201]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[03:29:57.301 --> 03:30:00.283]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[03:30:06.232 --> 03:30:09.394]  You know, everybody, my critics told me that I can't talk to you.
[03:30:09.534 --> 03:30:10.534]  You know that, right?
[03:30:10.815 --> 03:30:17.799]  That they attacked me and said, he's been on InfoWars, so we can't listen to anything he says that might be productive and useful.
[03:30:18.979 --> 03:30:21.501]  But I say Kanye changed everything.
[03:30:22.261 --> 03:30:23.902]  And you know, I can love you.
[03:30:23.922 --> 03:30:25.203]  I don't have to disagree with you.
[03:30:25.883 --> 03:30:49.606]  So I'm gonna take Kanye's lead and say I'm Switzerland I'll go on whatever show wants me to talk to their audience and share my opinion this whole freedom of speech business It's it's a big big idea And it keeps working like every time we we get a little more freedom of speech people are a little happier And they act surprised as the well freedom of speech worked again surprise so Kanye
[03:30:50.426 --> 03:30:53.269]  He is reminding us something I guess we forgot.
[03:30:53.449 --> 03:30:55.750]  Candace Owens is also part of the conversation.
[03:30:55.831 --> 03:31:06.539]  They're reminding us of the power of free, you know, free thought, free speech, the ability to talk to the people who are not your best friend, you know, the ability to talk to somebody without saying you can't talk to them.
[03:31:06.659 --> 03:31:08.761]  This is a big, big, big deal.
[03:31:09.241 --> 03:31:12.444]  You had a chance, I know you've been tweeting your stuff, and it's not like I'm enamored with a star.
[03:31:12.885 --> 03:31:18.010]  I'm enamored by top tier, you know, second or third, first, largest music person in the world.
[03:31:18.110 --> 03:31:19.252]  I think we've hit the tipping point.
[03:31:19.292 --> 03:31:22.135]  As you said during the break, in your own words, something's happening.
[03:31:22.495 --> 03:31:24.337]  So can you speak to that and what is happening?
[03:31:24.537 --> 03:31:33.583]  There seems to be some kind of shift in, you know, I hate to go to New Age, but, you know, because it would be easy to go into woo-woo land.
[03:31:33.963 --> 03:31:37.446]  But it feels like the way people are looking at things is changing.
[03:31:37.666 --> 03:31:39.147]  Now, Trump is a big part of that.
[03:31:39.267 --> 03:31:40.568]  North Korea is a big part.
[03:31:40.688 --> 03:31:41.689]  Kanye is a part.
[03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:52.015]  And I think that people are noticing that when we think in non-traditional ways and get out of the box and say, OK, we thought this was impossible.
[03:31:52.516 --> 03:31:53.997]  Let's just think, what if it isn't?
[03:31:54.818 --> 03:32:01.188]  So maybe the whole thing is just simply defined by possibility and I think that our notion of what is possible is
[03:32:02.140 --> 03:32:03.701]  Got expanded recently.
[03:32:04.181 --> 03:32:06.481]  North Korea and Kanye being the best examples of it.
[03:32:06.942 --> 03:32:08.122]  But I think there's more to come.
[03:32:08.142 --> 03:32:13.223]  It just, you know, I'm not going to get scientific about this because I can't offer you data.
[03:32:13.724 --> 03:32:24.447]  But now that the physical problems have been solved, you know, we can get enough physical resources to where we need it if we can figure out, you know, where to put it and how to get it there.
[03:32:25.748 --> 03:32:31.311]  So, we're in a world where there's great possibility, and we're being held back by the way we think of things.
[03:32:31.812 --> 03:32:36.415]  And we're watching that the way we think of things is being changed by thought leaders.
[03:32:36.795 --> 03:32:45.721]  I'll tell you, you know, when I was first asked to come on the show today by your producer, my first thought was, I'm too busy, too much going on, I'd love to, but I don't have time.
[03:32:46.282 --> 03:32:52.186]  And then I saw people telling me in the news, hey, you can't go on InfoWars, and I said, well, I'm going to clear my schedule now.
[03:32:52.646 --> 03:32:55.108]  Because Kanye says I can talk to anybody I want.
[03:32:56.528 --> 03:32:58.530]  So, it's changing things.
[03:33:06.194 --> 03:33:10.377]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.699 --> 03:33:17.421]  He's going the distance.
[03:33:17.461 --> 03:33:19.002]  He's going for speed.
[03:33:34.542 --> 03:33:37.531]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:33:38.133 --> 03:33:39.477]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:42.423 --> 03:33:46.706]  Doug Hagman, InfoWars.com, sitting in for Alex Jones, so thankful for that.
[03:33:46.726 --> 03:33:48.087]  You know, leave nothing to chance.
[03:33:48.107 --> 03:33:53.310]  I was talking during the break to the wonderful production staff of InfoWars.com.
[03:33:53.330 --> 03:33:55.512]  They're fantastic people, by the way.
[03:33:56.092 --> 03:33:56.933]  Leave nothing to chance.
[03:33:56.993 --> 03:33:58.814]  I said, would you tell me when I'm going live?
[03:33:58.854 --> 03:34:04.578]  So anyway, our guest right now is Dr. Paul L. Williams, and of course, he's the other half.
[03:34:04.718 --> 03:34:07.500]  Doctor, you heard Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown.
[03:34:10.021 --> 03:34:16.807]  Paul Williams is the co-author of The Killing of Uncle Sam, which is available at the InfoWars store.
[03:34:16.947 --> 03:34:18.888]  Get it via InfoWars.com.
[03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:20.810]  The Killing of Uncle Sam.
[03:34:21.410 --> 03:34:22.471]  Reserve your copy now.
[03:34:22.531 --> 03:34:23.732]  This is going to be coming out next week.
[03:34:24.153 --> 03:34:26.675]  It's an incredible book, I just have to tell you.
[03:34:26.695 --> 03:34:28.176]  But the other side of this...
[03:34:29.091 --> 03:34:34.377]  The other assault against Uncle Sam and against our nation is being discussed now with Dr. Williams.
[03:34:34.397 --> 03:34:36.459]  Dr. Williams, we're talking about Islamberg.
[03:34:36.479 --> 03:34:38.461]  We're talking about the Muslims of the Americas.
[03:34:38.481 --> 03:34:47.591]  We're talking about paramilitary training by Islamic, in my view, personal opinion, based on my observations, terrorists in the United States.
[03:34:48.211 --> 03:34:48.952]  Were we left off?
[03:34:49.353 --> 03:34:51.535]  Of course, we're talking about the investigations both you and I did.
[03:34:53.098 --> 03:34:54.138]  Yes, Doug.
[03:34:54.158 --> 03:35:09.643]  At Islamberg, after I followed up on your original visit there, your lead, I interviewed several people from Islamberg, and I found out that at the end of their training,
[03:35:10.445 --> 03:35:14.209]  They all were going to Pakistan.
[03:35:14.289 --> 03:35:15.431]  They all went to Pakistan.
[03:35:16.011 --> 03:35:22.439]  I'll tell you my major finding at the end of this, but they came back with Pakistan.
[03:35:23.019 --> 03:35:31.589]  The settlement there at Islamberg, outside of Hancock, New York, is now filled with Pakistani women.
[03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:51.265]  They practice polygamy there, of course, and the African-Americans who are recruited from the prison system and trained at Islamberg, after their basic training, they're deployed to Pakistan, and from Pakistan they enter Afghanistan and they fight with the Taliban.
[03:35:51.285 --> 03:35:55.248]  Dr. Williams, how can that be?
[03:35:55.288 --> 03:35:55.828]  How can America
[03:35:59.475 --> 03:35:59.836]  I think?
[03:36:17.337 --> 03:36:23.219]  I reported to them, I reported to the state police, I showed them the pictures, everything else, and nothing happened.
[03:36:23.519 --> 03:36:33.263]  The residents up there, as you know, you interviewed them too, they're scared witless from the activities and the explosions that they hear from the camp.
[03:36:33.683 --> 03:36:36.864]  They've called the police, they've called the FBI, and nothing gets ever done.
[03:36:37.344 --> 03:36:39.505]  Well, this is what I discovered.
[03:36:40.045 --> 03:36:42.146]  These people go to Pakistan.
[03:36:42.906 --> 03:36:43.226]  I think so.
[03:37:00.533 --> 03:37:00.933]  We're good
[03:37:30.755 --> 03:37:32.383]  And what happens is...
[03:37:34.631 --> 03:37:40.314]  What I discovered is that the CIA set up these camps beginning in 1979.
[03:37:40.534 --> 03:37:51.180]  They brought Jelani and Blind Sheikh Rahman from Cairo to the United States to Andrews Air Force Base on U.S.
[03:37:51.640 --> 03:37:52.821]  military transports.
[03:37:53.341 --> 03:37:55.402]  They were taken here by the CIA.
[03:37:56.623 --> 03:38:00.645]  Jelani, for a couple weeks, received training
[03:38:02.009 --> 03:38:10.955]  From the CIA at Langley, and then he was dispatched to Brooklyn to recruit African Americans for the Great Jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
[03:38:11.775 --> 03:38:29.307]  So, in the beginning, his efforts were confined to Brooklyn, and he would recruit jihadis, or people who wanted to take part in the jihad of African Americans all, and ship them to Pakistan.
[03:38:30.007 --> 03:38:38.254]  And later the CIA discovered that it's much more cost-efficient to train these people in the United States.
[03:38:38.755 --> 03:38:45.661]  So the CIA set up these training camps, including Islamberg, and training camps throughout the country for Jelani.
[03:38:46.441 --> 03:38:49.143]  And this went on for 10 years.
[03:38:49.583 --> 03:39:00.469]  They were training people for the Great Jihad to take part in the Soviet-Afghan War in Afghanistan, which made sense to fight the Communists.
[03:39:01.450 --> 03:39:04.011]  We could kind of believe that there was some necessity in that.
[03:39:04.772 --> 03:39:09.014]  But this is what really bothered me for a long time, Doug.
[03:39:09.415 --> 03:39:13.217]  At the end of that, at the end of the Soviet-Afghan War,
[03:39:14.117 --> 03:39:27.840]  The CIA continued to fund Jelani and continued to allow, not allow, but to work with Jelani to create more and more and more of these paramilitary camps throughout the country.
[03:39:28.780 --> 03:39:36.322]  Some in Georgia, some in Texas, some in California, some in the Midwest, one in Toronto.
[03:39:37.522 --> 03:39:38.742]  I mean, they're all over the place.
[03:39:38.802 --> 03:39:41.783]  In Virginia, I visited one in Virginia several times.
[03:39:43.783 --> 03:40:04.334]  What I couldn't put my brain around was why, after the Soviet-Afghanistan war was over, why was the CIA continuing to support Yelani and continuing to sprout these camps up on American soil?
[03:40:05.194 --> 03:40:12.038]  And then I came to realize, and this is what really brought me to Rodney Howard Brown and killing Uncle Sam.
[03:40:13.154 --> 03:40:20.857]  I came to realize that the CIA, all of their covert operations are funded by narcotics, primarily heroin.
[03:40:22.017 --> 03:40:31.241]  And heroin has become, the CIA since 1947, never received one dime for its black operations, its covert operations.
[03:40:31.821 --> 03:40:33.462]  All that funding came from heroin.
[03:40:34.382 --> 03:40:37.163]  So the heroin in Afghanistan became vital.
[03:40:37.984 --> 03:40:42.167]  For the CIA interest at the end of the Soviet-Afghan war.
[03:40:42.848 --> 03:40:57.098]  And Jelani, by supporting the Taliban, and these people being trained on our soil going to Pakistan and then joining the Taliban, was really to help with the drug trade.
[03:40:58.243 --> 03:41:08.691]  Exactly, and Dr. Williams, let me stop you right there, because this is why, okay, so we conducted, I conducted surveillance and investigation, extensive.
[03:41:08.751 --> 03:41:15.236]  As a matter of fact, these are my typed notes from the investigation.
[03:41:15.276 --> 03:41:21.741]  I don't know if that could be seen, but I mean, it's actually, there's about 400 typed pages.
[03:41:24.123 --> 03:41:25.945]  And of course, my handwritten notes are elsewhere.
[03:41:25.985 --> 03:41:34.294]  But the fact is, photographs, video, typed notes from the surveillance investigation, we turned it over to the FBI.
[03:41:34.414 --> 03:41:35.135]  I know you did.
[03:41:35.255 --> 03:41:36.296]  I turned it over to the FBI.
[03:41:36.336 --> 03:41:39.640]  In fact, the FBI said, hey, send the report here.
[03:41:40.261 --> 03:41:44.065]  So I did that, as you've done with the FBI, with the state police.
[03:41:44.765 --> 03:41:45.965]  What happens before the Inc.
[03:41:45.985 --> 03:41:55.909]  is writing those reports, all of a sudden, the head of the compounds, this network, Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani, he knows about the reports.
[03:41:55.929 --> 03:41:57.549]  He knows about the surveillance.
[03:41:57.589 --> 03:41:58.709]  We've been compromised.
[03:41:59.430 --> 03:42:02.090]  And just weeks later, by the way, there's a picture of my car.
[03:42:02.110 --> 03:42:05.471]  I don't know if the camera people can put that car on.
[03:42:06.012 --> 03:42:13.194]  After I had given the reports to the FBI, I came out of a courthouse and
[03:42:14.671 --> 03:42:18.615]  Press the F-O-B, the clicker, you know, whatever that thing is.
[03:42:19.216 --> 03:42:22.258]  And that's my car, right there on the screen.
[03:42:22.799 --> 03:42:26.983]  Now look, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that, I'm not saying, I'm just saying, okay?
[03:42:27.023 --> 03:42:28.845]  I ain't saying, because look, I don't know what happened.
[03:42:28.905 --> 03:42:31.808]  I had a car fire, which is pretty interesting, days after that.
[03:42:32.588 --> 03:42:37.673]  Paul, I didn't mean to dominate this segment, but we only have about 30 seconds, or about 20 seconds here.
[03:42:37.693 --> 03:42:38.954]  In fact, we're going to go to break right now.
[03:42:39.475 --> 03:42:44.600]  When we come back, you're going to have the floor, but I just wanted to say, look, the FBI, CIA, they know about this.
[03:42:44.700 --> 03:42:50.185]  They're, and as Alex Jones said, and as you've written about, the CIA is involved, the FBI is involved.
[03:42:50.205 --> 03:42:51.586]  People say, oh, that's BS.
[03:42:51.626 --> 03:42:53.047]  Well, no, we've got the proof.
[03:42:53.448 --> 03:42:54.809]  Dr. Paul Williams has got the proof.
[03:42:55.490 --> 03:42:56.711]  Get right back in Fort Worth.com.
[03:43:04.386 --> 03:43:22.694]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I might speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:22.794 --> 03:43:28.697]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:29.077 --> 03:43:29.757]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:29.857 --> 03:43:33.039]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:33.679 --> 03:43:34.640]  And so much more.
[03:43:35.220 --> 03:43:36.341]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.561 --> 03:43:38.282]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:38.302 --> 03:43:43.986]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:44.106 --> 03:43:45.307]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:45.327 --> 03:43:47.248]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:47.328 --> 03:43:49.709]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:49.929 --> 03:43:51.190]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:51.370 --> 03:43:53.172]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:53.732 --> 03:43:54.332]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:54.452 --> 03:43:55.733]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:55.873 --> 03:43:57.074]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:03.160 --> 03:44:03.881]  I'm so excited.
[03:44:03.941 --> 03:44:13.507]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:44:14.107 --> 03:44:19.271]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:44:19.611 --> 03:44:22.393]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:44:22.613 --> 03:44:31.359]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:44:33.480 --> 03:44:38.263]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:44:38.804 --> 03:44:41.565]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:44:41.706 --> 03:44:52.593]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:44:53.093 --> 03:44:54.374]  It is amazing!
[03:44:55.775 --> 03:45:00.738]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:45:02.503 --> 03:45:11.327]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[03:45:12.567 --> 03:45:14.368]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[03:45:14.408 --> 03:45:21.531]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[03:45:21.951 --> 03:45:27.734]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[03:45:28.434 --> 03:45:29.755]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[03:45:30.356 --> 03:45:49.409]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[03:45:50.490 --> 03:45:54.612]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[03:45:54.932 --> 03:46:00.194]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[03:46:00.614 --> 03:46:01.654]  As above, so below.
[03:46:02.215 --> 03:46:05.036]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[03:46:05.936 --> 03:46:07.017]  Most tiny of scales.
[03:46:07.537 --> 03:46:08.638]  And that's what this comes down to.
[03:46:09.039 --> 03:46:10.540]  America is building its wall.
[03:46:10.940 --> 03:46:11.421]  Will it work?
[03:46:11.541 --> 03:46:12.041]  We don't know.
[03:46:12.541 --> 03:46:13.122]  Is Trump right?
[03:46:13.823 --> 03:46:15.924]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[03:46:16.425 --> 03:46:22.410]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[03:46:22.770 --> 03:46:28.675]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[03:46:29.395 --> 03:46:35.699]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[03:46:36.459 --> 03:46:39.721]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[03:46:39.981 --> 03:46:51.468]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[03:46:52.128 --> 03:46:54.489]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[03:46:55.150 --> 03:46:58.371]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at infowarslife.com.
[03:46:58.712 --> 03:47:02.454]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[03:47:05.675 --> 03:47:08.297]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:22.868 --> 03:47:29.059]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:33.112 --> 03:47:39.074]  Just rocking to the tunes, Doug Hagman sitting in our number four for Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:47:39.254 --> 03:47:41.235]  Don't forget, visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:41.315 --> 03:47:49.737]  Pick up your copy of the book, The Killing of Uncle Sam, with a very special guest, a good friend of mine, Dr. Paul L. Williams is a co-author of that.
[03:47:49.757 --> 03:47:53.238]  You heard Rodney Howard Brown in studio with Alex Jones the first couple of segments.
[03:47:53.658 --> 03:47:58.720]  Dr. Williams is with me during this final segment here via telephone.
[03:47:58.740 --> 03:48:02.141]  By the way, Dr. Williams and myself, if you think we're making this up,
[03:48:02.641 --> 03:48:07.447]  This is a law enforcement, uh, this is actually dissemination restricted law enforcement.
[03:48:07.707 --> 03:48:10.631]  This is from the Regional Organized Crime Information Center, right here.
[03:48:11.231 --> 03:48:11.872]  And this is dated 2006.
[03:48:11.912 --> 03:48:17.339]  Jamal Del Foucault and Dr. Williams and myself both heavily cited in this report.
[03:48:17.839 --> 03:48:18.940]  So we're not making this up.
[03:48:19.160 --> 03:48:20.381]  This actually did happen.
[03:48:20.802 --> 03:48:23.824]  And inside this report are some of the surveillance pictures that we took.
[03:48:24.164 --> 03:48:35.253]  Yes, there is a school bus at the, or there was at the time of the surveillance, a school bus being used for target practice and also for military-style occupation of that school bus.
[03:48:35.293 --> 03:48:36.174]  There it is on your screen.
[03:48:36.194 --> 03:48:39.076]  Now this is actually Fox News footage.
[03:48:39.177 --> 03:48:40.658]  You're with Neil Cavuto.
[03:48:40.698 --> 03:48:41.619]  We borrowed that
[03:48:42.199 --> 03:48:42.579]  Thanks, Doug.
[03:48:42.619 --> 03:48:43.460]  Call me Paul, please.
[03:48:43.480 --> 03:48:43.880]  I'm your buddy.
[03:49:05.914 --> 03:49:16.545]  We're talking about the fact that these people at Islamberg and the other compounds throughout the country have been funded by the CIA.
[03:49:17.226 --> 03:49:21.050]  And we were discussing also that at the end of their training at these
[03:49:23.090 --> 03:49:23.870]  I think so.
[03:49:43.445 --> 03:50:04.887]  What I discovered, Doug, about Jelani and all of these operatives is that they have been supported and continue to be supported with black funds from the CIA, that their purpose in Afghanistan is to create a strategy of tension.
[03:50:05.687 --> 03:50:06.728]  You just think about this.
[03:50:07.148 --> 03:50:08.750]  Why are they fighting with the Taliban?
[03:50:09.130 --> 03:50:10.711]  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[03:50:10.891 --> 03:50:12.272]  It's mind-boggling.
[03:50:12.632 --> 03:50:14.314]  And it was for me for the longest time.
[03:50:14.814 --> 03:50:19.698]  But what's going on is, in Afghanistan right now, we need a strategy of tension.
[03:50:19.798 --> 03:50:29.325]  We need to arm and enable and empower the Taliban so that we have a military presence there.
[03:50:30.597 --> 03:50:37.462]  Because the CIA, the entire funding for the CIA came from the heroin market.
[03:50:38.202 --> 03:50:48.569]  And up until this day, now the CIA is working with the Mexican cartels and developing the copy fields around the Sonora region of Mexico.
[03:50:48.949 --> 03:50:55.934]  But for decades and decades and decades, our troops were there to protect the heroin fields.
[03:50:56.234 --> 03:50:58.556]  You see our soldiers, you can get pictures of them.
[03:50:59.296 --> 03:51:10.526]  You know, walking through the fields, not allowed to firebomb, not allowed to destroy any of the poppy crops, but rather to protect them.
[03:51:11.306 --> 03:51:12.507]  It's almost mind-boggling.
[03:51:12.888 --> 03:51:18.793]  But it goes down, like all of our listeners should realize that this has been going on for decades.
[03:51:19.333 --> 03:51:19.453]  Sure.
[03:51:38.488 --> 03:51:40.509]  This is not conspiracy.
[03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:42.809]  This is all fact.
[03:51:43.529 --> 03:51:59.393]  The Kerry Commission, who probed into the CAA, established the fact that the CAA had created banks to launder money throughout the world, drug money, and that the source of all their covert funding is heroin.
[03:51:59.873 --> 03:52:02.234]  I mean, this was brought out before the American people.
[03:52:02.954 --> 03:52:15.657]  So, these paramilitary camps, when I discovered this, when you look into the mirror and you're trying to find the enemy, you're looking at the enemy.
[03:52:15.677 --> 03:52:16.357]  The enemy is us.
[03:52:16.877 --> 03:52:20.778]  Because we created this strategy of tension in Afghanistan.
[03:52:20.818 --> 03:52:23.058]  The Taliban, of course, had nothing to do with 9-11.
[03:52:25.739 --> 03:52:28.720]  Everything that we're doing, we're being puppeteered.
[03:52:31.199 --> 03:52:36.984]  When I discovered that, when I discovered the most radical mosque in the country, like the Al-Farouk Mosque in Brooklyn.
[03:52:37.705 --> 03:52:40.728]  Which you were held, you visited and you were held captive there.
[03:52:40.768 --> 03:52:41.188]  Yeah.
[03:52:41.609 --> 03:52:42.189]  Right?
[03:52:42.249 --> 03:52:51.217]  But I also discovered, Doug, digging into it, is that this mosque receives over, the Al-Farouk Mosque, over two million dollars a year from U.S.
[03:52:51.257 --> 03:52:51.918]  taxpayers.
[03:52:52.728 --> 03:52:53.329]  And funds!
[03:52:53.409 --> 03:52:54.170]  I mean, come on!
[03:52:54.630 --> 03:52:57.153]  The Gulen movement is sponsored by the CIA.
[03:52:57.733 --> 03:53:09.245]  All of these... So, when I discovered that, and all the books that I had written before then, like Salma's Revenge, the Nixon 9-11, everything that I had written was a lie!
[03:53:10.189 --> 03:53:13.090]  I spent my life propagating a lie.
[03:53:13.430 --> 03:53:18.331]  I had been trained at the... I worked for William F. Buckley at the National Review.
[03:53:18.371 --> 03:53:22.752]  I wrote the articles.
[03:53:22.772 --> 03:53:23.853]  I wrote articles for him.
[03:53:24.333 --> 03:53:26.253]  And I was trained as a neocon.
[03:53:26.714 --> 03:53:29.854]  And everything that I was led to believe was a lie.
[03:53:30.675 --> 03:53:39.117]  That really, everything that was going on was propagated by their false flag attacks, false news.
[03:53:41.405 --> 03:53:42.146]  Manipulation.
[03:53:43.007 --> 03:53:48.891]  And I have been manipulated as much as, probably more so than anyone in the country.
[03:53:49.652 --> 03:53:52.554]  And when I came to realize that, I was crushed.
[03:53:53.195 --> 03:53:56.577]  And that's when I met Dr. Rodney Howard Brown.
[03:53:56.637 --> 03:54:03.703]  I met him at an event in Washington, D.C., a patriotic event, for a fireworks display, really.
[03:54:03.763 --> 03:54:05.364]  I wasn't there for any religious reason.
[03:54:05.805 --> 03:54:06.185]  But I met
[03:54:06.865 --> 03:54:13.852]  I met Rodney there, Dr. Rodney Howard Brown, and I started talking to him about, you know, this government.
[03:54:13.872 --> 03:54:15.153]  It's not a deep state, Doug.
[03:54:15.213 --> 03:54:16.274]  It's even deeper than that.
[03:54:19.665 --> 03:54:26.947]  It's a small group of international bankers and businessmen who control every bloody thing.
[03:54:27.588 --> 03:54:38.851]  And I talked to Rodney about that, and he said, well, it all started with Cecil John Rhodes in South Africa in 1877 when he formed his secret society.
[03:54:38.871 --> 03:54:43.713]  And in the secret society were the most powerful people in London, the Rothschilds,
[03:54:44.253 --> 03:54:45.494]  We're good to go.
[03:55:11.503 --> 03:55:12.124]  We're good to go.
[03:55:36.572 --> 03:55:39.933]  It's really not hard to document that, and that's what we did.
[03:55:40.194 --> 03:55:46.756]  Yeah, I was going to say, we kind of circle right back around to the killing of Uncle Sam.
[03:55:46.996 --> 03:55:51.638]  Your book, you co-authored with Dr. Rodney Howard Brown, and there it is right there.
[03:55:52.418 --> 03:55:54.379]  Paul, we've got about a minute left.
[03:55:54.439 --> 03:55:56.440]  I'm going to have to cut you loose for about a minute.
[03:55:57.800 --> 03:56:12.781]  Yeah, you were part of it, you were part of the neocon movement, you got red-pilled, you and I both found out that we were being lied to, and everything that Alex Jones is saying on InfoWars, everything that his guests are saying on InfoWars, it is absolutely true, and they are trying to shut us up, right?
[03:56:13.422 --> 03:56:15.623]  So, Alex, you know, I pat him on the back.
[03:56:15.663 --> 03:56:19.605]  I've never met him, but if I did, I'd embrace him.
[03:56:20.046 --> 03:56:29.151]  But what I'd like to say is, I'm not making money on that book, and neither is Rodney Howard Brown.
[03:56:29.851 --> 03:56:31.792]  Every dime from that book.
[03:56:31.932 --> 03:56:43.775]  Everybody that buys a book is supporting the River School of Government so that people can be educated in what's actually taking place within our government so that they can be elected.
[03:56:44.276 --> 03:56:45.396]  We're raising people.
[03:56:46.136 --> 03:56:52.984]  So they can enter politics, enter the political arena with sledgehammers and knock the entire system down.
[03:56:53.384 --> 03:57:01.613]  So everything goes to the River School of Government so that we can recruit students, train them, give them absolutely solid academic training.
[03:57:02.134 --> 03:57:06.518]  And nobody, it's completely a non-profit enterprise.
[03:57:06.758 --> 03:57:08.060]  Nobody's making anything out of it.
[03:57:08.320 --> 03:57:10.281]  Dr. Paul Williams, gonna have to cut you loose.
[03:57:10.401 --> 03:57:12.463]  Thank you so very much for appearing with me.
[03:57:13.223 --> 03:57:15.585]  And Alex Jones, thank you so much for allowing this to happen.
[03:57:15.645 --> 03:57:16.485]  Thank you, Paul.
[03:57:16.765 --> 03:57:17.806]  And we'll be talking with you.
[03:57:17.826 --> 03:57:18.226]  Thank you, buddy.
[03:57:18.246 --> 03:57:19.507]  Great to be with you.
[03:57:21.849 --> 03:57:22.749]  Folks, there it is.
[03:57:23.029 --> 03:57:23.470]  There it is.
[03:57:23.790 --> 03:57:29.534]  Dr. Paul Williams capping off a fantastic segment with Dr. Rodney Howard-Brown and Alex Jones.
[03:57:30.054 --> 03:57:30.554]  There it is.
[03:57:31.215 --> 03:57:33.216]  From Islamberg Infiltration
[03:57:34.190 --> 03:57:35.651]  Paramilitary training compounds.
[03:57:35.711 --> 03:57:40.212]  The fought was against Dr. Williams and myself to what we're seeing today.
[03:57:40.532 --> 03:57:43.173]  Why do you think the censorship issue is so big?
[03:57:43.253 --> 03:57:44.774]  Why do you think they're trying to shut us up?
[03:57:45.294 --> 03:57:46.954]  Doug Hagman out for InfoWars.
[03:57:47.014 --> 03:57:47.955]  InfoWars.com.
[03:57:47.995 --> 03:57:48.375]  God bless.
[03:57:54.580 --> 03:57:59.021]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:57:59.241 --> 03:58:03.942]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:58:04.542 --> 03:58:10.383]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[03:58:10.803 --> 03:58:23.405]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:58:24.165 --> 03:58:32.813]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:58:32.833 --> 03:58:34.775]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:58:35.095 --> 03:58:36.216]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:58:36.236 --> 03:58:37.538]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:58:37.718 --> 03:58:38.899]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:58:39.279 --> 03:58:40.581]  Man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:58:41.102 --> 03:58:42.684]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:58:42.704 --> 03:58:44.507]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:58:44.867 --> 03:58:47.471]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:58:47.511 --> 03:58:48.372]  This is insane.
[03:58:48.793 --> 03:58:50.395]  I said, yeah, you look ten years younger.
[03:58:50.656 --> 03:58:53.219]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:58:53.660 --> 03:58:57.045]  He says, this is totally free, but he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:58:57.065 --> 03:58:58.908]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
