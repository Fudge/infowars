[00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:33.492]  What he's trying to do, because he's a weak person, and not a very smart person, what he's trying to do is end, and it's very simple, he's got himself a big prison sentence, and he's trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up a story.
[00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:34.273]  Now here's the thing.
[00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:41.639]  Even if he was right, it doesn't matter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.
[00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:45.541]  I was running my business, a lot of different things during the campaign.
[00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:53.587]  So very simply, Michael Cohen is lying and he's trying to get a reduced sentence for things that have nothing to do with me.
[00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:06.668]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:11.572]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:18.237 --> 00:01:28.405]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:44.642]  If you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.
[00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:46.523]  I consider it to be an invasion.
[00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:48.984]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:54.486]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:56.787]  Thank you for telling me that.
[00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:59.088]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:02.009]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.430]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.933]  Do you think that you demonized immigrants in this election?
[00:02:06.953 --> 00:02:07.473]  Not at all.
[00:02:07.513 --> 00:02:08.014]  No, not at all.
[00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:10.816]  I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally.
[00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:12.778]  You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process.
[00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:19.824]  The president, along with his favorite TV network, were beating the drum on the looming so-called invasion, as they put it.
[00:02:20.104 --> 00:02:22.626]  The programming on the caravan was propaganda.
[00:02:22.887 --> 00:02:25.309]  It was political campaign-motivated propaganda.
[00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.731]  Trump is like a racist Paul Revere, you know?
[00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:28.812]  The migrants are coming!
[00:02:28.852 --> 00:02:29.833]  The migrants are coming!
[00:02:30.413 --> 00:02:34.574]  Your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:35.574]  Well, that's true.
[00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:36.335]  But they weren't actors.
[00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:37.195]  They're not going to be doing that.
[00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:37.935]  They weren't actors.
[00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:38.975]  No, it's true.
[00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:40.296]  Do you think they were actors?
[00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:41.236]  They weren't actors.
[00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:42.316]  They didn't come from Hollywood.
[00:02:42.556 --> 00:02:44.357]  He keeps calling it an invasion!
[00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:46.798]  Yes, an invasion of strollers.
[00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:53.980]  He made news by ratcheting up the caravans, scare talk, and the troop numbers he believes are needed to meet this alleged threat.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.340]  They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.120]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:58.281]  That's not an invasion.
[00:02:58.401 --> 00:02:58.861]  Honestly?
[00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:06.125]  I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.
[00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:12.848]  Tonight, the first 800 migrants from the Central American caravan are at America's doorstep in Tijuana, Mexico.
[00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.391]  The first wave of the migrant caravan arrived unexpectedly early at the U.S.
[00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:21.373]  border in Tijuana, where there's been a fortified wall for decades.
[00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:24.695]  They've been looking through the barricade, and some have been climbing it.
[00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:30.618]  They split off from a larger group of about 5,000 and are planning to request asylum here in the U.S.
[00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:33.239]  So the Democrats want open borders.
[00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.280]  Let everybody come in.
[00:03:36.861 --> 00:03:38.401]  Let everybody pour in.
[00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:39.262]  We don't care.
[00:03:39.362 --> 00:03:41.082]  Let them come in from the Middle East.
[00:03:41.603 --> 00:03:43.984]  Let them come in from all over the place.
[00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:45.384]  We don't care.
[00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:47.485]  We're not gonna let it happen.
[00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:53.068]  A group of Central American migrants fleeing north to safety, aka the caravan.
[00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:55.809]  That's called an invasion of our country.
[00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:56.449]  It's pretty obvious.
[00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.769]  You don't need me to tell you this, but I will.
[00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:10.313]  The president is firing up his base with the issue that helped propel him into the White House in 2016, which is slamming undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border with Mexico.
[00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.154]  He keeps calling it an invasion!
[00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:13.214]  What would you call it?
[00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:20.136]  When Trump said that there was a caravan, while Acosta said, no, it's hundreds of miles away from here.
[00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:21.577]  They're hundreds of miles away though.
[00:04:21.597 --> 00:04:23.399]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:24.520]  That's not an invasion.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.784]  As many as 4,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Tijuana as soon as tomorrow.
[00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:36.950]  Homeland Security has even said the caravan approaching the border is harboring more than 200 folks with criminal history.
[00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:38.412]  That's called an invasion.
[00:04:40.717 --> 00:04:43.921]  Folks, we're going to come back live on this Friday Global Transmission.
[00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:46.464]  David Knight's coming up as well, and so much more.
[00:04:46.924 --> 00:04:48.506]  This is the most censored show in the world.
[00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:56.856]  Without you spreading the word, without you taking action, they're going to destroy InfoWars, and they're going to destroy the country, and they're going to destroy every free person on this planet.
[00:04:57.276 --> 00:04:59.539]  And remember, the government's run by pedophiles.
[00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:00.420]  They want to rape your kids.
[00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:06.822]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:06.842 --> 00:05:16.412]  Before we head back into some more news stories, I want to tell you about the great specials available at InfoWarsStore.com right now, where we have the Cyber Week special running.

[00:05:53.541 --> 00:06:01.206]  They're trying to undermine us, financially sabotage us at every available opportunity, so we rely on your support more than ever at infowarestore.com.
[00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:35.608]  On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha You can listen to the engine moaning out his one-note song You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
[00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:45.245]  Well, it's hard to believe it's already Friday, November 30th, 2018, and the year is almost over.
[00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:47.266]  And what have we seen?
[00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:49.888]  What have we seen unfold?
[00:06:49.908 --> 00:07:06.796]  We can see the private corporate world government allied with the CHICOMS and the EU and Hollywood and all their paid-off millions trying to whip this country and other nation-states into submission
[00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.550]  To their globalist tyranny.
[00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:20.094]  Right now our president is in South America trying to negotiate a more equitable, fair deal with Communist China and others.
[00:07:20.114 --> 00:07:29.157]  I don't have to go into how China has a totally one-sided deal set up that way by Western elites 50 years ago.
[00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:40.426]  Now they've used it to take China, from a country with almost no running water or electricity 50 years ago, to an industrial juggernaut more powerful than the United States.
[00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:52.796]  They're not more powerful intellectually, they're not more powerful economically, they're not more powerful militarily, but they are industrially way more powerful than the U.S.
[00:07:53.397 --> 00:07:56.759]  The globalists strategically said, Europe and the U.S.
[00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:58.861]  will be service economies.
[00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:12.962]  On a global balance of power, where China doesn't have a big military, and doesn't expand outside their borders, but they're given the deep water ports, they're given the Panama Canal, they're given all the rare earth minerals.
[00:08:13.662 --> 00:08:17.024]  That's a global UN agreement, framework.
[00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:19.545]  How do you think China has 98% of rare earth minerals?
[00:08:20.526 --> 00:08:24.428]  The stuff you need for all the semiconductors, and for all the computers, and all the devices.
[00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:27.470]  Because globally, they've been given that.
[00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:30.982]  By the US, by Europe, by the globalists.
[00:08:31.503 --> 00:08:34.324]  They have been set up to win to have the Chinese century.
[00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:37.886]  That's what the CFR teaches in colleges.
[00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:46.571]  And then along came Donald Trump, along came Nigel Farage, along came all these other patriots now, who said, wait a minute.
[00:08:47.532 --> 00:08:56.497]  We didn't vote to enter these things, and it's all one-sided, and Canada has a 280% tariff on dairy, and we have no tariff, and China has a couple hundred percent.
[00:08:57.708 --> 00:08:59.289]  Tariffs on our goods, we have nothing on them?
[00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:01.630]  No wonder they've built everything up!
[00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:02.851]  No wonder this has all happened!
[00:09:03.712 --> 00:09:10.856]  But the Communist Party then takes all that money and parlays it into taking over other parts of the world, not even giving their people anything!
[00:09:13.778 --> 00:09:21.282]  That's an easy choice to say we're going to side with America and with Trump and with our own self-interest and with prosperity and with freedom!
[00:09:23.244 --> 00:09:27.026]  China is the most evil nation the world's ever seen by a long shot!
[00:09:28.387 --> 00:09:30.469]  But it's almost like in the media they don't exist.
[00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:34.492]  Well, they're Asian, so if they kill 100 million people, it's no big deal.
[00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.513]  Or if they have human clones, it's no big deal.
[00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:42.017]  Or if they have cows 25 years ago growing humanoids in them for organ harvesting, it's no big deal.
[00:09:42.057 --> 00:09:53.206]  Or if they 20 years ago had cows with human udder cells that produce human milk that's been drunk on Chinese shelves for decades, it's no big deal.
[00:09:54.147 --> 00:09:58.449]  If they've got goats that are part spider that create body armor, it's no big deal.
[00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.032]  If they let homeless people just starve to death on the side of the street, it's no big deal.
[00:10:03.212 --> 00:10:06.674]  If they take Christians to death camps and work them to death, it's no big deal.
[00:10:07.034 --> 00:10:08.675]  If they kill Buddhists, it's no big deal.
[00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:12.677]  If they shell Buddhist monasteries in Tibet, it's no big deal!
[00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:15.459]  Because only white people are bad.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.741]  And that's the sick culture.
[00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:28.878]  And that's what we face, is a billion, 400 million slaves in China, with almost every party member, only a few thousand of them, being billionaires in China.
[00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:29.979]  Communism.
[00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:37.302]  With ultra-rich people with a bunch of slaves, and our own establishment allied with them, because our own establishment owns a piece of China!
[00:10:38.483 --> 00:10:40.564]  You can move to China, and pay zero tax.
[00:10:41.364 --> 00:10:42.365]  As long as you become state-run.
[00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:44.564]  U.S.
[00:10:44.604 --> 00:10:52.987]  companies should not be allowed, when we built them, we paid for them, to leave and to give all of their strategic information to the CHICOMS and become state-run.
[00:10:53.227 --> 00:10:53.867]  That's treason!
[00:10:55.647 --> 00:11:05.070]  If I tried that, I'd be arrested and I should, but when it's done under the IMF and World Bank and TPP and agreements and governments signed off on it, they claim it's legal.
[00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.211]  No, it's not legal, even if you pass some damn piece of paper!
[00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:09.872]  I say it's treason!
[00:11:10.432 --> 00:11:11.672]  And Trump says it's treason!
[00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:13.733]  And we're reversing it, period!
[00:11:16.604 --> 00:11:27.889]  And it's time for Americans to not be intimidated by the thugs that have hijacked our government, and to realize they're a very small group in the command and control positions, and almost everyone below them hates their guts.
[00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:31.710]  The most awake group in this country is the U.S.
[00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.110]  government.
[00:11:34.091 --> 00:11:43.855]  90% of the people below it are really freaked out about the fraud, waste, and abuse, and the leftist, and the SJWs being hired to incompetently come in, who are obsessed
[00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:47.868]  Their religion is defecating in the halls.
[00:11:48.389 --> 00:12:06.585]  By the way, if you think I'm joking, and it's in psychology and it always shows up when a society starts to collapse, they caught all over Portland on the local news, businessmen coming out and pooping on the street to be naughty.
[00:12:07.886 --> 00:12:09.067]  White liberal businessmen.
[00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:11.870]  I'm not kidding.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.163]  And they thought they would shame them, but the left came out and said, no, we celebrate public defecation.
[00:12:17.463 --> 00:12:21.126]  It's in Paul Joseph Watson's report, Portland is a S.H.
[00:12:21.166 --> 00:12:21.827]  you-know-what hole.
[00:12:22.447 --> 00:12:23.668]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:12:24.229 --> 00:12:25.770]  You want to see the undercover videos of it?
[00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:32.635]  It is a sacrament for them, a religion to crap on the street and make you smell their filth.
[00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:36.338]  Now, why am I starting the show like that?
[00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:40.057]  Because that's who these people are.
[00:12:40.077 --> 00:12:41.819]  They want to hurt your kids.
[00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:43.720]  They want to brain damage your kids.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.261]  They want to groom your children.
[00:12:45.442 --> 00:12:46.502]  They want control.
[00:12:46.823 --> 00:12:48.324]  They want to defile things.
[00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:55.810]  And until you start standing up to them, it's only going to get worse.
[00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:05.377]  Now coming up, Roger Stone and I have a battle plan for Trump to take action to defeat these people.
[00:13:05.597 --> 00:13:07.399]  And finally they admit, Robert,
[00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:24.274]  Mueller has filed paperwork in the Michael Cohen case that says Trump is person number one, like we told you years ago, like he's a mafiadon, and that the plan is to indict Trump.
[00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:26.515]  Now, under the Constitution, that indictment will go nowhere.
[00:13:27.155 --> 00:13:27.936]  Separation of powers.
[00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:29.757]  But it will be held up like it is.
[00:13:31.518 --> 00:13:32.678]  And that's always been the plan.
[00:13:33.198 --> 00:13:35.640]  There's no obstruction, there's no lying, there's no nothing.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.301]  All of it is by Robert Mueller.
[00:13:38.257 --> 00:13:39.819]  And Hillary Clinton and these criminals.
[00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:43.403]  But now, individual number one, clues of Mueller.
[00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:46.807]  We're getting the building blocks, we're told, of what they have.
[00:13:47.268 --> 00:13:51.192]  Yeah, it's called raiding hundreds of lawyers that work for Trump and it's hundreds of properties.
[00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:55.297]  You gotta hire a lawyer that works in the town you're at or is under that state bar.
[00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:58.281]  Finding dirt on a lawyer that has nothing to do with Trump.
[00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:13.122]  They've so far rated like 20 of Trump's lawyers, and then saying, 50 years in the penitentiary for the 15 million you laundered, Michael Cohen, or flip on all the testimony you said that Trump was never involved in this stuff, or we'll put you in prison.
[00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:18.024]  We're going to go to break.
[00:14:18.044 --> 00:14:19.664]  We're going to come back.
[00:14:20.464 --> 00:14:22.365]  We're going to go through all of this on the other side.
[00:14:22.785 --> 00:14:27.046]  Please remember that without you supporting us, we will not be here.
[00:14:27.964 --> 00:14:41.516]  Please remember that we're under attack because we're on target, and that the videos, and the books, and the t-shirts, and the water filtration, and all of it is 50 to 75% off, biggest clearance sale ever, for Cyber Week.
[00:14:41.536 --> 00:14:47.342]  And we're going to continue this sale right through until Christmas, but a lot of it won't be there because it's going to be sold out.
[00:14:47.602 --> 00:14:51.626]  So whether it's Brain Force, or X3, or X2, or SuperMetal Vitality, it's all about to sell out.
[00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:55.638]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:03.516]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, without you supporting us, we will not be here.
[00:15:03.816 --> 00:15:04.636]  We will not be on air.
[00:15:04.656 --> 00:15:05.917]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:15:05.957 --> 00:15:07.577]  But please, don't fight the crowds.
[00:15:07.977 --> 00:15:09.278]  Don't go through all that garbage.
[00:15:09.538 --> 00:15:10.978]  Don't fight the traffic.
[00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:18.521]  No, the thing to do is to go to InfoWarsTore.com, whether it's emergency radios or optics, just thousands of great items.
[00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.082]  Patriot apparel for men and women, it's all there.

[00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:33.027]  Or Infowarslife.com to go right to the supplements.
[00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:39.810]  But without you, ladies and gentlemen, funding us, without you supporting us, we will not be here.
[00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:41.652]  These are great products you need.
[00:15:42.092 --> 00:15:47.915]  Don't fight the crowd, support the Infowar, and get great products that you and your family need at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:52.178]  All right, coming up, Roger Stone with the biggest news yet.
[00:15:53.339 --> 00:16:00.490]  That they filed their intention to indict the president and how do we counter-strike against these clear and present enemies of this nation.
[00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:01.472]  We're declared enemies.
[00:16:02.634 --> 00:16:04.796]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[00:16:04.856 --> 00:16:10.600]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.142]  Thank you for telling me that.
[00:16:13.282 --> 00:16:15.264]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:18.166]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[00:16:18.226 --> 00:16:19.567]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[00:16:19.587 --> 00:16:21.449]  But do you think that you demonized the invasion?
[00:16:21.469 --> 00:16:24.551]  Jim Acosta told the President that the caravan didn't exist.
[00:16:25.932 --> 00:16:31.176]  And then, of course, they also said that it didn't exist when he pulled the microphone away and pushed the intern's arm down.
[00:16:32.122 --> 00:16:34.645]  But of course, the caravan does exist.
[00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:37.567]  There's more than 50,000 people still making their way up.
[00:16:37.988 --> 00:16:42.633]  More than 10,000 as of today are already massing on the border.
[00:16:43.153 --> 00:16:51.742]  And I have the camera crew and reporters there on the ground sending back incredible live feeds and also reports.
[00:16:52.783 --> 00:16:53.744]  But just think about that.
[00:16:54.505 --> 00:17:04.429]  Remember when the PR operative for Obama, Jonathan Gruber, bragged, thank God Americans are so stupid, thank God you have no attention span?
[00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.991]  You know, it's not just Jim Acosta that said that there is no caravan.
[00:17:09.271 --> 00:17:15.734]  At first they said, oh, the caravan's all women and children, they're all so sweet, and then they smash over the Guatemala border into Mexico, and okay, well,
[00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:17.536]  They deserve to be here.
[00:17:17.816 --> 00:17:19.437]  And then, oh, they're not violent.
[00:17:19.457 --> 00:17:20.917]  And then, oh, it doesn't exist.
[00:17:20.937 --> 00:17:21.538]  You're crazy.
[00:17:22.158 --> 00:17:23.778]  It's something Trump made up for the election.
[00:17:24.298 --> 00:17:32.141]  And now when Trump says, OK, we've beefed up security there, well, now he's a horrible, evil racist for not letting these people in.
[00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:34.802]  And less than 10% are women and children.
[00:17:35.442 --> 00:17:44.645]  And we catch the media cropping photos in a staged event with a woman with two kids with no shoes that just supposedly came up thousands of miles from Central and South America.
[00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:52.808]  And the lies go on and on from there, and that's why InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com existing is so critical.
[00:17:53.428 --> 00:18:09.514]  Because the only way for these insane lies to work, saying that there are more than two genders, saying that mother and father is bad, saying that world government doesn't exist while they're promoting it, all the things they're doing, saying the surveillance state's a great thing, but also saying it doesn't exist, all this 1984 garbage,
[00:18:11.834 --> 00:18:14.096]  We can't stand being challenged at all.
[00:18:14.196 --> 00:18:28.648]  And that's why all over the world a reign of censorship is coming in, in a perfect storm of dying corporate media, big megacorporations, authoritarian regimes like Communist China, the EU, the Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down.
[00:18:29.782 --> 00:18:39.094]  Loyal Americans and other loyal nationalists and just people that want free market and success and know that the American system, while not perfect, has been the best the world ever saw.
[00:18:39.474 --> 00:18:48.665]  And we don't want to adopt this crony capitalist model like Communist China has done, where the heads of the party are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and the general public starving to death.
[00:18:49.466 --> 00:18:51.368]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[00:18:51.448 --> 00:18:52.869]  This is sick.
[00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.892]  This is an attack on common sense, an attack on logic.
[00:18:56.393 --> 00:18:58.494]  And that's why InfoWars is more important than ever.
[00:18:59.175 --> 00:19:01.477]  We've got live feeds every day with our reporters.
[00:19:01.858 --> 00:19:04.080]  It's amazing at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:12.929]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas and this holiday season, all of you remember that without you supporting InfoWars financially, we will be shut down.
[00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.611]  And we make it easy to do.
[00:19:15.012 --> 00:19:16.133]  We've got amazing products.
[00:19:16.173 --> 00:19:23.941]  We've got Cyber Week going right now, extending our big mega sales for Black Friday, while supplies last, water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements.
[00:19:24.742 --> 00:19:29.844]  T-shirts, books, films, it's all there, and it makes the information war possible against the globalists.
[00:19:29.864 --> 00:19:34.265]  So, I want to thank you this Christmas for your support, and I want to ask you for your continued support.
[00:19:34.625 --> 00:19:38.367]  It's a 360 win because these products are great, and these sales are the biggest ever.
[00:19:38.607 --> 00:19:43.288]  Free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off across the board, and double Patriot points.
[00:19:43.708 --> 00:19:47.009]  Right now, at InfowarsStore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.353]  But whatever you do, take action today and spread the word and spread the live info.
[00:19:53.413 --> 00:19:54.733]  Where's links and articles?
[00:19:55.074 --> 00:19:58.536]  Pass the censors because when you take action, nothing on earth can stop you.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.622]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:19.025 --> 00:20:24.030]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.081 --> 00:20:41.126]  Right before we went on air this morning, I was talking to Roger Stone about the dire straits this country is in, and he
[00:20:43.155 --> 00:20:53.521]  Laid into a very cutting, spot-on, five-minute analysis to me that I, a thousand percent, a trillion percent, agree with.
[00:20:53.541 --> 00:21:05.808]  And this is what we must do, what Trump must do, to block the horrible globalist deep staters that openly work with foreign powers, that have openly raised interest rates and tried to talk down the economy to kill the recovery.
[00:21:06.148 --> 00:21:07.468]  These people are the globalists.
[00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:08.189]  They are the plague.
[00:21:08.249 --> 00:21:09.530]  They are the enemy.
[00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.371]  And we've told Trump everything that was going to happen.
[00:21:12.411 --> 00:21:13.892]  How he was illegally spied on.
[00:21:14.792 --> 00:21:16.813]  How Hillary still had her emails.
[00:21:17.054 --> 00:21:18.394]  How the NSA has them.
[00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:21.736]  How he was always known as individual number one.
[00:21:22.256 --> 00:21:23.877]  We broke that over a year and a half ago.
[00:21:24.277 --> 00:21:27.059]  And now the Houston Chronicle is the big top story.
[00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:29.260]  Individual number one.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.821]  The President's the target.
[00:21:32.372 --> 00:21:36.636]  Mueller and all the Democrats told Trump, oh, you're not the target, we know.
[00:21:36.716 --> 00:21:41.861]  And Rosenstein a few months ago told Trump, sir, we've looked, no evidence, we know there's no Russia.
[00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:44.103]  But they never were going after Russia.
[00:21:44.823 --> 00:21:53.051]  They're going after all his lawyers, trying to find dirt on them to then get them to do a plea bargain to get out of it to lie about the president.
[00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:57.195]  And that is what is going on right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:57.495 --> 00:22:16.001]  So without getting into all the minutiae of the latest bull, which is total garbage, and the fact that we have this stool pigeon, pled guilty to $15 million in laundered money, nothing to do with Trump, changing all the stories now and saying Trump knew about trying to build a tower, he's got hundreds of towers around the planet, in Russia, and that's the big proof.
[00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:18.341]  And oh, they've got to impeach him now.
[00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:19.322]  This is outrageous.
[00:22:19.362 --> 00:22:23.203]  So Trump now knows they're going to move against him, but there is a clear
[00:22:24.903 --> 00:22:30.408]  Constitutionally, it's not just President Trump's right, it's his duty to stand against these people.
[00:22:31.508 --> 00:22:48.321]  And so in the next six and a half minutes, we're going to lay out what has to happen to this illegitimate house, this illegitimate system, this illegitimate election, and these criminals, and what we should do with the subpoenas, what Trump should do with the subpoenas that are coming with all these fake investigations, and how he goes on the offense now.
[00:22:48.781 --> 00:22:52.024]  Roger Stone, former chief advisor to the president, break it down for us.
[00:22:54.690 --> 00:23:04.692]  Look, I think this interview that the President gave to the New York Post is really quite incredible because what it shows you is the President has the detonator in his hands.
[00:23:05.152 --> 00:23:23.135]  He now has the goods on their abusive use of FISA warrants, the implications, the treasonous implications of Uranium One, the illegitimate efforts by the Obama administration's FBI to infiltrate the Trump campaign.
[00:23:23.815 --> 00:23:24.957]  I think he has been woke.
[00:23:24.977 --> 00:23:25.878]  I think he now understands
[00:23:41.639 --> 00:23:48.943]  Despite being lulled by Rod Rosenstein and his own initial attorneys, that he is the target.
[00:23:49.143 --> 00:23:51.924]  That the big old target is right on his back.
[00:23:52.265 --> 00:23:59.368]  It's not Roger Stone or Jerry Corsi or Michael Cohn or Alex Jones.
[00:24:00.209 --> 00:24:01.629]  It's none of these people they want.
[00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:03.010]  They want Donald Trump.
[00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.592]  And they're trying to euchre him into some kind of perjury trap.
[00:24:07.413 --> 00:24:11.495]  Short of declassifying the documents, what can he do today?
[00:24:12.135 --> 00:24:12.495]  Easy.
[00:24:13.015 --> 00:24:27.761]  Direct the Acting Attorney General, Mr. Whitaker, to name a special counsel on the matter of Uranium One and on the matter of the illegal and unconstitutional use of FISA warrants.
[00:24:28.181 --> 00:24:31.822]  Have him immediately convene a grand jury.
[00:24:32.182 --> 00:24:36.464]  Have that grand jury issue indictments of those involved
[00:24:36.964 --> 00:24:40.066]  And they'll then authorize their arrest.
[00:24:40.587 --> 00:24:42.828]  That will bust this wide open.
[00:24:43.509 --> 00:24:56.657]  Is it incidental that the prosecutor leading the investigation into me, Aaron Zelinsky, is the same man who led the cover-up of the Clintons' involvement in Uranium One?
[00:24:57.198 --> 00:24:58.699]  Is that a coincidence?
[00:24:59.239 --> 00:25:19.459]  Is it a coincidence that the other chief prosecutor in the potential prosecution of Roger Stone is Jeannie Rhee, a woman who represented the Clinton Foundation in the matter of the missing emails in which I am being unfairly investigated, since I know nothing about them?
[00:25:19.879 --> 00:25:22.482]  The President needs to go on the offense.
[00:25:22.882 --> 00:25:29.988]  He controls the machinery of the Justice Department now and it must be turned on these criminals immediately.
[00:25:30.208 --> 00:25:38.636]  And he signals he's going to do that and separately in the next two months before they, or the next month and a half before they have this lame duck group in early January.
[00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:44.544]  We need, and the reason I call these Democrats lame duck is, this was illegitimate.
[00:25:44.964 --> 00:25:53.949]  They stole these House races in front of God and country, and the Democrats accused Trump of stealing an election with no evidence.
[00:25:54.269 --> 00:26:02.654]  We have total evidence, so break down, also following precedent of what Eric Holder did on Fast and Furious, what Trump should do.
[00:26:03.482 --> 00:26:06.185]  Well, there's two very important precedents that have now been set.
[00:26:06.746 --> 00:26:20.021]  The president, in my opinion, should regard any subpoena from the new House Democrats the exact same way that Eric Holder regarded subpoenas from the Republican House regarding Fast and Furious.
[00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:21.301]  Ignore them.
[00:26:21.662 --> 00:26:24.123]  Challenge them to try to enforce them.
[00:26:24.623 --> 00:26:30.987]  Secondarily, however, Mr. Comey, the former FBI director, now refuses to testify before the Congress.
[00:26:31.047 --> 00:26:38.291]  In fact, yesterday he went to court to try to seek to block a subpoena requiring him to testify.
[00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:40.372]  So if Comey doesn't have to testify,
[00:26:40.712 --> 00:26:43.753]  Why should anyone in the Trump administration have to testify?
[00:26:44.154 --> 00:26:47.015]  The election of the House majority is illegitimate.
[00:26:47.375 --> 00:26:53.778]  Just as you don't recognize the election of Donald Trump, we don't recognize the election of a Democratic House.
[00:26:54.198 --> 00:26:58.700]  Sorry, Adam Schiff, you are the chairman of nothing, of zero.
[00:26:59.101 --> 00:27:01.122]  Your majority is stolen.
[00:27:01.462 --> 00:27:03.703]  It is done on the basis of illegitimacy.
[00:27:03.943 --> 00:27:06.144]  That's what you said about Donald Trump's presidency.
[00:27:06.424 --> 00:27:08.265]  So you are the chairman of nothing.
[00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:10.126]  We don't recognize your authority.
[00:27:10.506 --> 00:27:11.246]  To do anything.
[00:27:12.567 --> 00:27:20.930]  And to be clear, this country is at total war with collaborators working with offshore corporations, the chat coms and others with Hollywood to demoralize and break down this country.
[00:27:21.311 --> 00:27:29.134]  They have publicly, the Democrats and the Hollywood scum like Bill Maher have said, let's plunge the economy to stop Trump.
[00:27:29.174 --> 00:27:30.435]  And now they've raised interest rates.
[00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:31.995]  They brag that they've done it.
[00:27:32.035 --> 00:27:33.376]  They're trying to suppress it further.
[00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.617]  The president must start having weekly
[00:27:36.838 --> 00:27:43.341]  State of the Nation speeches building up the next month or so to an emergency State of the Union.
[00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:45.562]  He has to just lay it all out.
[00:27:46.142 --> 00:27:49.883]  Lay out Bob Mueller and the Uranium One.
[00:27:50.003 --> 00:27:52.544]  Lay out Hillary in the emails and just do it.
[00:27:52.684 --> 00:27:53.585]  If they want to fight,
[00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:54.846]  They've got one.
[00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:56.148]  It's now do or die.
[00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:59.874]  Trump was lied to by his lawyers that he wasn't the target.
[00:28:00.234 --> 00:28:02.598]  And now he knows they're a bunch of double-dealing cowards.
[00:28:02.919 --> 00:28:04.200]  And so he's taking the gloves off.
[00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:08.146]  And Roger, that itself is the really good news, isn't it?
[00:28:08.925 --> 00:28:15.529]  Well, it is, and the president should not allow this media-created myth of Robert Mueller as some kind of saint.
[00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:37.124]  The president should go on national TV and outline Mr. Mueller's involvement in 9-11, his involvement in VCCI, his involvement in Pan Am 103 Lockerbie, his involvement in the anthrax scandal, his involvement with Whitey Bulger, and I think the American people will see... His involvement with the Russians, his involvement with the Saudis, his involvement with everything.
[00:28:37.184 --> 00:28:38.565]  He is Mr. Dirt.
[00:28:39.205 --> 00:28:40.766]  He is Mr. Corruption.
[00:28:41.487 --> 00:28:43.568]  I mean, we didn't even list half the crowd.
[00:28:44.108 --> 00:28:45.569]  You're absolutely right.
[00:28:45.589 --> 00:28:46.630]  There are two keys to this.
[00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.251]  FISA warrants and Uranium One.
[00:28:49.552 --> 00:28:51.193]  Follow the money.
[00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:54.735]  Go on the attack, or they will destroy not just Trump, but the whole country.
[00:28:55.015 --> 00:28:56.256]  America's fighting for its life.
[00:28:56.296 --> 00:28:57.056]  Trump's our champion.
[00:28:57.276 --> 00:28:58.597]  Roger Stone, God bless you.
[00:28:58.957 --> 00:28:59.978]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:00.018 --> 00:29:00.979]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:29:06.054 --> 00:29:24.053]  If we look at how Brighton is as an area, it's got an extremely high LGBT population, it's extremely liberal, so when kids are in a school and they feel, oh, there's no stigma attached to being gender fluid or trans, so if they feel supported in an environment, then they're going to be questioned.
[00:29:24.053 --> 00:29:33.020]  Why should they be encouraged to do this when it's clearly for many of them... Because there's nothing wrong with being questioning about... Nobody's going to persuade me that 76 kids at one school in Brighton woke up one day and decided to be gender fluid.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.421]  Well, who said that they woke up one day?
[00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:37.523]  Who says that it's not something that happens overnight?
[00:29:37.663 --> 00:29:38.844]  It's something... But where does this end?
[00:29:38.884 --> 00:29:41.566]  Do we end up with literally nobody in the future?
[00:29:42.266 --> 00:29:43.987]  Identifying as male and female?
[00:29:44.047 --> 00:29:45.228]  Well, maybe, maybe.
[00:29:45.308 --> 00:29:45.548]  Really?
[00:29:45.748 --> 00:29:46.688]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:47.909]  Why would you be happy with that?
[00:29:47.929 --> 00:29:52.772]  Not nobody, but some, you know, some people are trans and that's, that's the fact.
[00:29:52.852 --> 00:29:57.034]  Do you genuinely think 76 kids in one school are transgender?
[00:29:57.094 --> 00:29:58.014]  I'm saying that it's a possibility.
[00:29:58.074 --> 00:29:58.815]  Or do you think it's possible?
[00:29:58.895 --> 00:29:59.535]  Is it possible?
[00:29:59.555 --> 00:30:00.315]  I say it's a possibility.
[00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:01.336]  They've all just, they've all just...
[00:30:01.616 --> 00:30:12.000]  Let's now go back to Faith Goldie, who is a woman.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.101]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:30:13.281 --> 00:30:14.441]  Faith Goldie is a woman.
[00:30:14.581 --> 00:30:15.402]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:15.502 --> 00:30:16.062]  I am a man.
[00:30:16.102 --> 00:30:17.042]  You can see the difference.
[00:30:17.082 --> 00:30:17.342]  I'm ugly.
[00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:17.803]  She's pretty.
[00:30:18.243 --> 00:30:18.943]  She can have babies.
[00:30:19.023 --> 00:30:19.403]  I can't.
[00:30:19.583 --> 00:30:21.744]  I can gouge people's eyeballs out pretty easily.
[00:30:21.804 --> 00:30:23.745]  She might not be able to do it as easy, but she's pretty tough.
[00:30:23.865 --> 00:30:25.466]  Faith, thanks for coming on with us today.
[00:30:25.486 --> 00:30:26.086]  It's great to see you.
[00:30:26.206 --> 00:30:27.527]  Thanks for having me back on, Alex.
[00:30:27.787 --> 00:30:40.897]  As for the grooming of these young autistic children, that's what we're seeing across the UK and other jurisdictions, this is just the next evolution of what the Gay-Straight Alliance groups across North America, that they were putting into our school institutions.
[00:30:40.937 --> 00:30:43.019]  This is just Generation 2.
[00:30:43.119 --> 00:30:53.787]  They were basically breeding grounds to normalize deviant behavior, and then also not just normalize it, but also to sort of make it a trend, and that's indeed what we're seeing here.
[00:30:54.087 --> 00:30:55.808]  They're preying on autistic children.
[00:30:56.088 --> 00:31:08.193]  This is what some of the most tyrannical regimes have done in even recent history, and that's to use the slow, the autistic, to help bolster, frankly, their statistics.
[00:31:08.234 --> 00:31:17.818]  And that's what this LGBT movement is doing, is that they're preying on autistic children so to bolster their statistics.
[00:31:18.158 --> 00:31:19.339]  This is beyond sick.
[00:31:19.379 --> 00:31:21.019]  This is, this is reprehensible.
[00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:23.580]  This is evil and it should be condemned in every single way.
[00:31:23.981 --> 00:31:27.662]  We were joking around a little, talking a little bit about sports during the, um, during the break.
[00:31:27.682 --> 00:31:28.743]  So I just want to say this.
[00:31:29.283 --> 00:31:31.924]  Men, turn off your TVs on Sundays.
[00:31:32.284 --> 00:31:36.506]  As video games are to young men, sports games are to older men.
[00:31:36.826 --> 00:31:40.668]  It is normal and natural for you to have loyalty, to have patriotism, to want to fight
[00:31:40.708 --> 00:31:47.530]  It's great for your country to want to have your team be victorious, but it's not on the 50-yard line.
[00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.490]  It's on your border lines right now.
[00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.830]  That's where we are called.
[00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:57.212]  Your colors are not some city that is far away from you that you might not even have any historical connection to.
[00:31:57.572 --> 00:32:01.793]  The colors that you should be bleeding are the ones on your national flag.
[00:32:02.193 --> 00:32:06.834]  And so I pray, folks, just turn off all of the sports balls.
[00:32:07.274 --> 00:32:08.835]  It's cucked nationalism.
[00:32:09.215 --> 00:32:14.617]  It's feeding natural appetites in a very unnatural and frankly unproductive way.
[00:32:14.757 --> 00:32:17.979]  So even if you know that they're fighting for your country, go fight for your family.
[00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:20.480]  Turn off your TV on Sunday.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.501]  It's just a bunch of guys taking a knee anyway.
[00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:28.603]  And go spend some time with Junior or spend some time with, you know, your local community center, whatever it is.
[00:32:29.003 --> 00:32:35.166]  And why don't you go have a rally against this UN migrant compact that we're going to be signing any day now down in Morocco.
[00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:44.354]  Look, if you look at all the top EU leaders right now, they've got all sorts of degeneracies, but one thing that they don't have are kids, and that's why they don't give a damn about the future of our nation.
[00:32:44.514 --> 00:32:54.643]  Unlike President God Emperor Donald Trump, it might be from a couple different ladies, but he's got lots of kids, and he sure as heck gives a damn about the future of not just that nation, but also all of the global order.
[00:32:54.663 --> 00:32:57.085]  So God bless him, and God bless America, and God bless you, Alex.
[00:32:57.105 --> 00:32:58.567]  I'm so happy I was back on your show today.
[00:32:58.647 --> 00:32:59.267]  You are awesome.
[00:32:59.347 --> 00:32:59.768]  Amazing.
[00:33:06.914 --> 00:33:09.635]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.817 --> 00:33:27.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the NBA.
[00:33:30.586 --> 00:33:31.967]  Epic times we're all living in.
[00:33:32.308 --> 00:33:34.309]  It's Friday, November 30th, 2018.
[00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:43.897]  This incredibly dangerous, out-of-control year is now almost over.
[00:33:44.038 --> 00:33:45.719]  And can you imagine what's coming in 2019?
[00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:58.030]  A real year of decisions about whether we're going to let the globalist counter-offensive work and take over society, or whether all of us are going to really put our heads down and take action.
[00:34:00.302 --> 00:34:05.464]  I want to, for TV viewers especially, but for radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[00:34:05.564 --> 00:34:14.807]  Roll some of the incredible raw footage that our team down on the Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, California, U.S.
[00:34:14.867 --> 00:34:18.809]  border have shot with drones and handheld.
[00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:23.371]  It is unbelievably illustrative of how the U.N.
[00:34:23.471 --> 00:34:23.991]  knowingly
[00:34:25.137 --> 00:34:43.375]  Brings refugees into nations, builds these horrible open-air camps, creates the crisis of disease and crime, and then demands that the countries then sign treaties giving the UN more money and more power and more control over the very crisis they admit they've engineered.
[00:34:45.515 --> 00:34:51.997]  The answers always give them more money than they pull on our heartstrings when we know that it's all part of a larger program.
[00:34:52.017 --> 00:34:58.540]  And we have interviews that are posted to Infowars.com where the illegal alien invaders are saying, we were promised everything would be free.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.200]  We were promised we'd get right in.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.261]  The UN lied to us.
[00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:05.869]  This is how world government conquers nation states.
[00:35:05.949 --> 00:35:13.212]  And right now, they're getting set next week to try to ratify a new global treaty where borders don't even exist.
[00:35:13.632 --> 00:35:22.195]  Even if countries say it does, other nations will gang up against you, like the EU, and will send in their navy to stop you.
[00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:37.156]  So this is 21st century warfare, ladies and gentlemen, with now over 50,000 people marching, or already now, on the border with California and the United States, where if they get through,
[00:35:38.598 --> 00:35:53.427]  Democrat judges will then shove a welfare spoon in their mouth, which the Democrats will then skim money off the top, and then put them into labor so that they can get money on every level of these people's misery, a new permanent underclass.
[00:35:53.767 --> 00:35:55.769]  This is the globalist program.
[00:35:56.889 --> 00:35:57.670]  It's cut and dry.
[00:35:58.499 --> 00:36:01.782]  And it's all based on squeezing the third world.
[00:36:01.922 --> 00:36:03.523]  Never allowing it to industrialize.
[00:36:03.923 --> 00:36:05.284]  Never allowing it to become free.
[00:36:05.344 --> 00:36:05.925]  That's on record.
[00:36:06.365 --> 00:36:07.686]  IMF and World Bank are on record.
[00:36:08.026 --> 00:36:12.289]  Suppressing the third world and keeping them in corruption and squalor as a political tool.
[00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.092]  And then you look at the Democrats and the blue cities they control.
[00:36:15.372 --> 00:36:16.713]  They're all third world as well.
[00:36:17.213 --> 00:36:19.155]  Because it's a formulae.
[00:36:19.955 --> 00:36:20.576]  It's a system.
[00:36:21.777 --> 00:36:23.358]  The globalists want to kill you in the womb.
[00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:34.017]  But if they can't, they're gonna then try to kill your brain with vaccines and GMO and cultural brainwashing and confusing your gender if you get out of the womb.
[00:36:34.777 --> 00:36:37.078]  Destabilization, being predatory is their plan.
[00:36:37.458 --> 00:36:45.140]  And our own Owen Schroeder went to the Austin City Council yesterday to point out, on record, that they are illegally
[00:36:46.055 --> 00:36:50.717]  Giving tens of millions of dollars of value to Planned Parenthood just at one facility.
[00:36:51.057 --> 00:36:52.018]  It's happening all over the country.
[00:36:52.798 --> 00:36:55.700]  And then Planned Parenthood gives them political contributions.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:03.083]  And these Democrats were up on the city council stage laughing at him while he talked about babies' hearts being stopped.
[00:37:03.623 --> 00:37:10.347]  This is the sick attitude and behavior of these people and it illustrates how at every level they're feeding on humanity.
[00:37:10.627 --> 00:37:12.988]  Here is Owen Schroer's powerful report.
[00:37:13.897 --> 00:37:15.899]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:37:15.999 --> 00:37:31.412]  I'm in front of the Austin City Council building where I'm set to speak where they have public communications here and I'm going to bring up a big issue of Planned Parenthood getting a government-owned property to rent for $1 a year.
[00:37:31.472 --> 00:37:32.853]  Now this has been going on since 1972.
[00:37:32.893 --> 00:37:33.273]  They just voted
[00:37:35.695 --> 00:37:38.899]  To extend this for up to 40 years.
[00:37:39.419 --> 00:37:41.281]  A major advantage for Planned Parenthood.
[00:37:41.461 --> 00:37:42.963]  But that's not all there is to the story.
[00:37:43.363 --> 00:37:46.086]  So I went to City Council today to raise awareness for this.
[00:37:46.447 --> 00:37:47.468]  I gave them all the facts.
[00:37:47.748 --> 00:37:48.449]  Let's see how it went.
[00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:53.164]  Thank you, Mayor Adler and members of the City Council present today.
[00:37:53.744 --> 00:37:58.108]  Mr. Renteria, last time I saw you, you were illegally campaigning outside of a polling place.
[00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.410]  That's not what I'm here to talk about today.
[00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:09.198]  What I'm here to talk about today is a giant pay-for-play scam, at the very least, happening in the state of Texas and Austin.
[00:38:09.738 --> 00:38:16.204]  This month, this City Council voted to once again allow Planned Parenthood to rent government-owned property for free for $1 a year.
[00:38:17.725 --> 00:38:20.628]  This property is valued at a fair market price per year of $110,000.
[00:38:21.088 --> 00:38:27.895]  This property is also about to receive renovations with a price tag of $1.2 million.
[00:38:28.415 --> 00:38:39.005]  This property had a bidder, Austin Life Care, who made a fair market bid to rent the property, and Austin Life Care offers the same services as Planned Parenthood, minus the abortions.
[00:38:39.546 --> 00:38:41.387]  That bid was ignored.
[00:38:42.188 --> 00:38:50.730]  Now, Planned Parenthood has been receiving this advantage since 1972, and thanks to this city council, that could go on for another 40 years.
[00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:56.271]  So it is fair to say that this Planned Parenthood clinic is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
[00:38:56.611 --> 00:39:06.874]  This on top of the millions of taxpayer dollars Planned Parenthood receives a year, half a billion this calendar year, one and a half billion over the last three years, yet this clinic needs free rent?
[00:39:08.114 --> 00:39:24.792]  Before I ask the City Council to justify this decision which goes against millions of Texans' spiritual, religious, and political beliefs, I will point out what to me is criminal pay-for-play activity happening between the Democrats, some of which are on this City Council, mind you, you identify as Democrats, and Planned Parenthood.
[00:39:25.453 --> 00:39:33.462]  In 2018, according to FEC filings and open secrets, reports the following Texas Democrats in Congress received campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood.
[00:39:33.482 --> 00:39:36.465]  So if this is untrue, I'm waiting to hear these Democrats disavow it.
[00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:50.741]  Or, I think this requires I file a federal complaint.
[00:39:51.261 --> 00:39:58.990]  How can any entity that receives government money be contributing to campaigns specifically to only one party?
[00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.553]  So, not to mention the millions of hearts,
[00:40:02.674 --> 00:40:08.678]  So I ask, and I'd like to get an answer today from this city council, how do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:37.317]  Laughing.
[00:40:37.597 --> 00:40:39.097]  And that's funny to Mr. Renteria.
[00:40:39.898 --> 00:40:43.120]  Do you realize that Planned Parenthood has admitted that they stopped beating hearts?
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.861]  And we're gonna fund that?
[00:40:46.261 --> 00:40:48.082]  So there's no comment from the City Council.
[00:40:48.342 --> 00:40:50.944]  Mayor Adler, can you justify that decision for the City of Boston?
[00:40:53.285 --> 00:40:54.386]  That's your time.
[00:40:54.586 --> 00:40:54.926]  Thank you.
[00:41:04.896 --> 00:41:08.317]  Now the full report, there's more, is up on Infowars.com.
[00:41:08.437 --> 00:41:08.757]  Get it.
[00:41:09.517 --> 00:41:12.018]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[00:41:13.259 --> 00:41:14.279]  Lawsuits need to be filed.
[00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:15.179]  This is all illegal.
[00:41:15.559 --> 00:41:17.160]  See, conservatives and Christians don't do it.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.741]  There's more than one way to stop these death facilities.
[00:41:21.482 --> 00:41:22.102]  You sue them.
[00:41:22.282 --> 00:41:24.443]  In fact, you know what?
[00:41:25.495 --> 00:41:27.417]  I'm a taxpayer in here in Austin.
[00:41:28.097 --> 00:41:29.379]  Maybe I should file that lawsuit.
[00:41:30.019 --> 00:41:32.521]  But it takes money to do that and that's why we need your financial support.
[00:41:37.757 --> 00:41:38.798]  Cyber Week sales.
[00:41:39.319 --> 00:41:41.601]  We'll have sales continuing through Christmas, but these are our biggest ever.
[00:41:41.621 --> 00:41:43.483]  A lot of stuff selling out to take advantage of those.
[00:41:43.903 --> 00:41:53.112]  Speaking of our children, here's just a few days ago in Lafayette, Louisiana, a man who dresses like a woman who wants to come talk to your kids, saying, I'm there grooming your children.
[00:41:53.352 --> 00:41:55.575]  This is the stuff going on in city councils all over the country.
[00:41:56.135 --> 00:41:58.537]  He wants to groom your children about LGBT.
[00:41:58.838 --> 00:42:03.362]  Imagine if a heterosexual man wanted to go to your school and groom your daughters about heterosexual sex.
[00:42:03.802 --> 00:42:06.104]  He keeps saying, it's disgusting that you don't want us to do this.
[00:42:06.485 --> 00:42:09.968]  No, you being obsessed with our children is disgusting!
[00:42:10.148 --> 00:42:10.909]  You monster!
[00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.549]  Here he is!
[00:42:12.398 --> 00:42:15.581]  I just want to let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful.
[00:42:15.901 --> 00:42:21.345]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:42:21.646 --> 00:42:26.309]  We are trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did.
[00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.591]  You're going to come talk to our kids about sex.
[00:42:28.852 --> 00:42:32.214]  What an over-the-top obviousness of this.
[00:42:32.755 --> 00:42:34.016]  By the way, I want to show you something.
[00:42:34.036 --> 00:42:34.957]  Here's David Knight's nose.
[00:42:34.977 --> 00:42:36.138]  He's about to take over live here.
[00:42:37.062 --> 00:42:38.884]  This is the type of notes he does for each show.
[00:42:39.864 --> 00:42:40.885]  Look at this amazing topic.
[00:42:40.905 --> 00:42:43.708]  David Knight's taking over today, the rest of Friday broadcast.
[00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:44.428]  A bunch of huge guests.
[00:42:44.949 --> 00:42:46.550]  Climate change or geoengineering?
[00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.492]  China unraveling DNA?
[00:42:48.912 --> 00:42:50.393]  It's a huge show he's got lined up.
[00:42:50.794 --> 00:42:51.654]  We need your help, folks.
[00:42:51.694 --> 00:42:52.595]  The children need your help.
[00:42:52.615 --> 00:42:54.056]  We need you to take action.
[00:42:54.196 --> 00:42:57.279]  Email InfoWars.com forward slash show to everyone you know.
[00:42:57.579 --> 00:42:59.581]  Tell folks in the local states you're listening to or watching.
[00:42:59.881 --> 00:43:00.762]  You are unstoppable.
[00:43:00.802 --> 00:43:01.563]  Please help us!
[00:43:03.303 --> 00:43:13.551]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[00:43:13.931 --> 00:43:25.980]  And as we prepare to close out 2018, isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:32.263]  What if you say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man?
[00:43:32.504 --> 00:43:33.744]  Well, that's dead naming.
[00:43:33.964 --> 00:43:41.988]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[00:43:42.368 --> 00:43:45.549]  Then they say it's racist to say, no, that it's okay to be white.
[00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:48.671]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation or borders.
[00:43:49.111 --> 00:43:51.752]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[00:43:52.232 --> 00:43:55.794]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:58.662]  World War III was the Cold War.
[00:44:00.043 --> 00:44:01.744]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[00:44:02.144 --> 00:44:19.736]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[00:44:21.488 --> 00:44:24.829]  The globalists are threatened by first world nations.
[00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:26.129]  They're threatened by the middle class.
[00:44:26.169 --> 00:44:30.490]  They're threatened by the uppity-ness of free market capitalism.
[00:44:31.071 --> 00:44:35.092]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[00:44:35.852 --> 00:44:37.452]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:40.633]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[00:44:41.694 --> 00:44:43.054]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:47.355]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[00:44:47.875 --> 00:44:50.636]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[00:44:52.159 --> 00:44:58.244]  But the globalists are counter-striking against independent, patriot, nationalist media like InfoWars.
[00:44:58.264 --> 00:45:02.727]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective.
[00:45:02.787 --> 00:45:05.550]  Thanks to your support, you have been the most effective.
[00:45:06.952 --> 00:45:08.212]  Exposing what's really happening.
[00:45:08.813 --> 00:45:13.114]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[00:45:13.574 --> 00:45:17.075]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[00:45:17.695 --> 00:45:21.677]  And I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[00:45:22.917 --> 00:45:24.017]  And without you, we won't be here.
[00:45:24.637 --> 00:45:28.638]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:32.179]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:32.639 --> 00:45:36.820]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.421]  So that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[00:45:41.481 --> 00:45:44.142]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[00:45:44.682 --> 00:45:46.684]  A tax would take an hour to go over to some of it.
[00:45:47.484 --> 00:45:54.549]  But you standing with us and buying the great products at InfoWareStore.com helps you and it also helps us get the word out.
[00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:57.231]  So it's symbiotic, a non-zero-sum game.
[00:45:57.812 --> 00:45:58.992]  The globalists are the opposite.
[00:45:59.032 --> 00:46:09.180]  They see everything as a win-lose proposition and they are hyper-aggressive, hyper-alpha to a point of absolute spiritual evil.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.461]  So right now,
[00:46:11.061 --> 00:46:27.729]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[00:46:28.209 --> 00:46:39.454]  And you are provisioning and funding, not just the second American revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[00:46:40.254 --> 00:46:41.355]  Forced sterilization.
[00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:43.016]  Children being sterilized.
[00:46:43.496 --> 00:46:46.478]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[00:46:46.578 --> 00:46:50.321]  And InfoWars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:52.942]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[00:46:53.202 --> 00:46:54.703]  And we will fight until the end.
[00:46:55.124 --> 00:46:57.405]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[00:46:57.465 --> 00:46:59.586]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[00:46:59.987 --> 00:47:01.127]  And thank you all for your support.
[00:47:01.348 --> 00:47:01.768]  God bless you.
[00:47:06.431 --> 00:47:10.993]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.376 --> 00:47:22.939]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.419 --> 00:47:26.240]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[00:47:33.963 --> 00:47:36.344]  All right, welcome on this Friday, November 30th, 2018.
[00:47:36.384 --> 00:47:41.026]  For the remainder of the program, I'm going to be your host.
[00:47:41.046 --> 00:47:42.486]  We're going to talk about a lot of things today.
[00:47:42.927 --> 00:47:49.589]  We're going to have, coming up in the next hour, we're going to have a whistleblower from the Ukraine, Andrei Talashenko.
[00:47:49.769 --> 00:47:57.573]  Now, he is somebody who has been closely involved in Ukrainian efforts to rig the election.
[00:47:58.033 --> 00:48:00.474]  There was actually collusion
[00:48:01.354 --> 00:48:06.657]  Between a political party and a foreign government, but nobody wants to talk about that.
[00:48:08.038 --> 00:48:09.699]  And as people talked about it, we had H.R.
[00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:18.083]  McMaster tell Bob Woodward in his book, famously, in fear, oh, this is just Russian propaganda that Trump is tweeting out there when he's talking about this.
[00:48:18.123 --> 00:48:24.047]  Well, we're going to talk to him about what's going on right now in Ukraine, because it is now a flashpoint that has been created by the
[00:48:24.881 --> 00:48:38.350]  Military-industrial complex, the neocon-never-Trumpers who are trying to overthrow our election, who have overthrown that country's government, and now he is in hiding because he's kind of caught between the two forces there.
[00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:39.711]  He was loyal to Ukraine.
[00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:41.872]  He's not a Russian propagandist by any means.
[00:48:42.513 --> 00:48:43.333]  He doesn't like Russia.
[00:48:44.234 --> 00:48:45.815]  He is a Ukrainian nationalist.
[00:48:47.189 --> 00:48:56.816]  But we're going to talk to him about what's going on in Ukraine, how that government is manipulating things, and how he has now become an enemy of the state there because he told the truth about what was going on.
[00:48:56.876 --> 00:49:04.422]  It's very dangerous now, all over the West, even here in the U.S., to tell the truth about what our governments are doing.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:10.485]  This is a very dangerous thing, and we want to congratulate him for doing that, but he's got a lot of information to tell us.
[00:49:10.505 --> 00:49:14.729]  We're also going to be talking about some updates on gun control.
[00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:18.693]  We have a back-and-forth questioning that happened two days ago.
[00:49:18.753 --> 00:49:20.895]  Nobody's picked up on this yet, except for New American.
[00:49:20.915 --> 00:49:26.901]  A back-and-forth questioning on a case of civil asset forfeiture before the Supreme Court.
[00:49:27.816 --> 00:49:40.782]  And you actually had the Attorney General of Indiana tell a Supreme Court Justice in questioning that, yes, they could confiscate your car if you were going five miles per hour over the speed limit under civil asset forfeiture.
[00:49:41.743 --> 00:49:46.545]  This is what it has come to for the slaves here in America.
[00:49:47.566 --> 00:49:49.106]  I've talked about this for a very long time.
[00:49:49.126 --> 00:49:49.867]  The danger
[00:49:51.261 --> 00:49:59.766]  Of destroying the rule of law and our fundamental liberties in order to pursue this insane, failed war on drugs prohibition that has no constitutional basis.
[00:50:00.047 --> 00:50:02.468]  It is a UN agenda, conservatives.
[00:50:02.488 --> 00:50:03.469]  You need to understand that.
[00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:07.411]  And now it has come to this.
[00:50:08.152 --> 00:50:09.793]  And so we'll talk about that also coming up.
[00:50:10.393 --> 00:50:16.837]  The billionaire space race that is developing as NASA tries to make this a private-public partnership.
[00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:19.199]  You know, how'd that work out for us with free speech?
[00:50:20.418 --> 00:50:28.781]  You know, we had these corporations that DARPA and the military-industrial complex and the government helped to get started, helped to give them a monopoly.
[00:50:28.801 --> 00:50:29.982]  A lot of people don't understand that.
[00:50:30.022 --> 00:50:35.824]  People at Reason, people at Cato Institute, a lot of people who call themselves libertarians or conservatives don't understand that.
[00:50:35.844 --> 00:50:39.946]  They don't understand how these technological monsters came into being.
[00:50:39.966 --> 00:50:42.046]  They don't understand the political partnership with them.
[00:50:42.086 --> 00:50:43.727]  And so now they're controlling cyberspace.
[00:50:43.747 --> 00:50:46.048]  Are we going to let them control outer space as well?
[00:50:47.076 --> 00:50:51.417]  They will be controlling urban space if we don't stop this Agenda 21 issue.
[00:50:52.357 --> 00:50:54.058]  So we'll talk a little bit about that as well.
[00:50:54.938 --> 00:50:59.319]  And I want to start out by talking about the so-called War on Christmas.
[00:50:59.379 --> 00:51:01.340]  Folks, there is no war on Christmas.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:02.580]  There really isn't.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.041]  This is something that's created.
[00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:07.922]  It's a very handy little slogan by Fox News.
[00:51:07.962 --> 00:51:10.182]  It kind of sounds like a Rankin-Bass production.
[00:51:10.402 --> 00:51:12.063]  You know, the year without Santa Claus.
[00:51:12.912 --> 00:51:15.614]  And now it's going to be the year without Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[00:51:15.794 --> 00:51:16.855]  Oh no, there is a war.
[00:51:17.755 --> 00:51:18.436]  There is a war.
[00:51:18.676 --> 00:51:20.017]  It is a cultural war.
[00:51:20.737 --> 00:51:25.581]  And we need to understand that I think it trivializes it to call it a war on Christmas.
[00:51:26.381 --> 00:51:34.647]  Folks, what they are trying to do is deconstruct every aspect of Western civilization, even down to our cartoons.
[00:51:34.667 --> 00:51:36.808]  I mean, it was Thanksgiving.
[00:51:36.828 --> 00:51:38.529]  They were coming after Charlie Brown Christmas.
[00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:39.870]  It's racist!
[00:51:40.391 --> 00:51:42.052]  Lookit, Charlie Brown Christmas is racist.
[00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:46.642]  I mean, it began with Nikki Haley and the Confederate Generals because of a mass murder.
[00:51:46.662 --> 00:51:48.643]  And they said, look, he's got a Confederate flag there in the back.
[00:51:48.663 --> 00:51:49.844]  So let's go after the Confederate Generals.
[00:51:49.864 --> 00:51:51.125]  Then they go after the Union Generals.
[00:51:51.145 --> 00:51:52.106]  Then they go after Lincoln.
[00:51:52.887 --> 00:51:54.928]  Then they go after Christopher Columbus.
[00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:57.130]  They were going after the Pilgrims every year.
[00:51:57.150 --> 00:52:00.212]  And now they come after the cartoons.
[00:52:00.673 --> 00:52:02.594]  When will the insanity end?
[00:52:02.814 --> 00:52:03.895]  Let's play a little.
[00:52:03.915 --> 00:52:07.157]  A lot of people have written stories about this tweet.
[00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:13.181]  From Huffington Post, they put together a little video explaining to you how horrible Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is.
[00:52:13.342 --> 00:52:22.187]  Now, we also had, and I talked about it two days ago, we had a guy, a science fiction writer, who was using J.R.R.
[00:52:22.247 --> 00:52:27.851]  Tolkien's Lord of the Rings as a metaphor for their political correctness, their agenda, and so forth.
[00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:33.395]  He actually got on and made the inane comment that the orcs
[00:52:34.235 --> 00:52:35.296]  We're good to go.
[00:52:52.971 --> 00:53:02.633]  But they're coming, and they're climbing over the walls, but, you know, they're just misunderstood, and so is Lord Sauron, or Soros, whoever, you know, just fill in the blank.
[00:53:03.033 --> 00:53:08.214]  He absolutely didn't realize how he was throwing his own argument under the bus.
[00:53:08.234 --> 00:53:10.315]  But this is how insane these people are.
[00:53:10.955 --> 00:53:14.356]  And they want to seize and deconstruct every aspect of our culture.
[00:53:14.616 --> 00:53:15.316]  Gondolf the White?
[00:53:15.976 --> 00:53:17.437]  That's racist imagery.
[00:53:17.917 --> 00:53:20.939]  No, it's Christian imagery that you don't understand anymore.
[00:53:21.299 --> 00:53:24.321]  But let's talk a little bit about this cartoon, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[00:53:25.182 --> 00:53:28.784]  It's just a cartoon.
[00:53:29.064 --> 00:53:29.845]  It's a cartoon.
[00:53:29.965 --> 00:53:31.626]  Like I said with Charlie Brown, good grief.
[00:53:32.266 --> 00:53:33.227]  Give us a break!
[00:53:33.667 --> 00:53:38.971]  But they won't give us a break until they break up and destroy everything about our culture.
[00:53:40.014 --> 00:53:42.236]  They are not multicultural.
[00:53:42.276 --> 00:53:43.437]  They don't embrace that at all.
[00:53:43.857 --> 00:53:48.001]  They want one monoculture that they will define.
[00:53:48.682 --> 00:53:51.764]  And so let's take a look at their objections to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[00:53:51.965 --> 00:53:53.886]  This is what Huffington Post tweeted out.
[00:53:55.488 --> 00:53:55.748]  Hey!
[00:53:55.848 --> 00:53:57.189]  Look at the feet!
[00:54:03.917 --> 00:54:05.438]  Okay, so they're making fun of Rudolph.
[00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:06.199]  Isn't that horrible?
[00:54:06.239 --> 00:54:06.979]  They're bullying him.
[00:54:06.999 --> 00:54:09.000]  Rudolph the Marginalized Reindeer.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:15.084]  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a holiday classic, they say, that returns to TV each holiday season.
[00:54:15.184 --> 00:54:19.667]  But lately, viewers are noticing the tale may not be so jolly after all.
[00:54:20.227 --> 00:54:23.889]  Because of all of these microaggressions that have been found in it.
[00:54:24.389 --> 00:54:28.512]  A yearly reminder that Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a parable of racism and homophobia.
[00:54:30.128 --> 00:54:30.908]  People are cheating out.
[00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:34.149]  Santa's operation is a human resources nightmare.
[00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:37.730]  Seriously needs diversity and inclusion.
[00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.491]  Former fans are pointing out Rudolph's father verbally abuses him.
[00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:43.552]  All right son, try it on.
[00:54:44.152 --> 00:54:45.152]  I don't want to.
[00:54:45.612 --> 00:54:46.992]  Daddy, I don't like it.
[00:54:47.052 --> 00:54:49.753]  You'll like it and wear it.
[00:54:49.873 --> 00:54:51.213]  Oh, but daddy.
[00:54:51.313 --> 00:54:52.414]  Oh, that evil father.
[00:54:52.594 --> 00:54:53.634]  It's not very comfortable.
[00:54:53.654 --> 00:54:55.715]  There are more important things than comfort.
[00:54:56.295 --> 00:54:56.895]  Self-respect.
[00:54:59.733 --> 00:55:02.295]  Santa Claus also berates Donner for his son's nose.
[00:55:02.396 --> 00:55:03.216]  You get the idea.
[00:55:03.436 --> 00:55:04.738]  It goes on and on.
[00:55:04.818 --> 00:55:08.481]  Donner, you should be ashamed of yourself and so forth.
[00:55:09.142 --> 00:55:09.802]  And it goes on.
[00:55:10.143 --> 00:55:10.983]  We'll stop it there.
[00:55:11.063 --> 00:55:15.888]  As one person tweeted out, I think the Onion made a fake Huffington Post video and hacked their Twitter.
[00:55:17.449 --> 00:55:21.893]  Now, if I would put up something like that, they would have shut me down because I did put out
[00:55:22.779 --> 00:55:27.641]  Uh, Babylon Bee, making a joke when everybody was talking about, uh, Pocahontas' DNA.
[00:55:27.681 --> 00:55:32.003]  They said, Hillary Clinton did a test, and she said, see, conservatives, I'm only 50% reptilian DNA.
[00:55:32.023 --> 00:55:38.105]  And they took down, uh, the Real News, uh, uh, Twitter feed for that, uh, the program I have in the morning.
[00:55:38.825 --> 00:55:42.507]  Uh, so, this is the way, there's double standards here, folks, for this kind of stuff.
[00:55:43.354 --> 00:55:54.181]  And as one person pointed out, who actually got it, you know, Paul Joseph Watson put up a story on Infowars going through all the different comments that people had about this.
[00:55:54.281 --> 00:55:59.604]  One person said, what is it with the left that makes them try and destroy everything and anything?
[00:55:59.864 --> 00:56:04.767]  It's like they have to suck out the joy of life by looking for things to be angry or outraged about 24-7.
[00:56:06.158 --> 00:56:09.704]  Well, maybe you've realized, he's starting to realize there's a pattern here.
[00:56:10.665 --> 00:56:12.528]  And it's not just a personality flaw.
[00:56:12.568 --> 00:56:13.911]  This is training.
[00:56:14.311 --> 00:56:18.218]  This is what they've been training children to do for the last several decades.
[00:56:18.839 --> 00:56:20.441]  From kindergarten through college.
[00:56:22.006 --> 00:56:23.147]  And now it is bearing fruit.
[00:56:23.187 --> 00:56:25.369]  Now this is something that's been going on for a long time.
[00:56:25.429 --> 00:56:33.334]  Jesus is now banned from a Christmas program at a Virginia middle school, reports the New American, Robius Middle School in Midlothian, Virginia.
[00:56:33.374 --> 00:56:39.499]  They have nixed the inclusion of Christmas carols that refer to Jesus or the Christian faith.
[00:56:40.019 --> 00:56:42.001]  Rudolph, however, is okay for now.
[00:56:42.301 --> 00:56:46.224]  Rudolph and Santa Claus, they're okay, but their days are numbered
[00:56:47.372 --> 00:56:51.814]  If these people who want to drag our culture to the ground are not stopped.
[00:56:52.975 --> 00:56:58.998]  One person says, I'm trying to rationalize how you can encourage diversity and yet be exclusionary in one specific area.
[00:57:00.079 --> 00:57:02.120]  Yeah, a little bit of cognitive dissonance there, isn't it?
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.541]  And as I said, it's not multiculturalism.
[00:57:05.341 --> 00:57:08.843]  It is monoculturalism, the culture that they define.
[00:57:09.484 --> 00:57:11.725]  And here is how they are defining it, folks.
[00:57:13.444 --> 00:57:25.351]  As we've talked many times about this Drag Queen Story Hour, where you have transgenders going from school to school, talking to very, very young children.
[00:57:26.347 --> 00:57:29.410]  Uh, showing them to, uh, you know, how to dress up and so forth.
[00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:35.855]  Uh, this one individual, who typically he performs, uh, in a R-rated, uh, situation.
[00:57:36.296 --> 00:57:39.178]  He says, it's okay, I-I can control myself.
[00:57:39.298 --> 00:57:40.419]  I know how to filter myself.
[00:57:40.439 --> 00:57:40.919]  Well, you know what?
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.701]  I know how to filter this guy, too.
[00:57:43.341 --> 00:57:44.342]  You keep him out of the school.
[00:57:45.183 --> 00:57:48.045]  But he says, that he is grooming the next generation.
[00:57:49.046 --> 00:57:51.188]  And, uh, he mentions that several times, grooming him.
[00:57:51.228 --> 00:57:52.069]  That's exactly what...
[00:57:56.355 --> 00:57:57.537]  I need massive funding.
[00:57:57.557 --> 00:57:58.679]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:00.741]  Cyber Week's going on right now.
[00:58:00.822 --> 00:58:01.903]  Storewide free shipping.

[00:58:08.412 --> 00:58:11.857]  Whatever the best products are that people need that help folks.
[00:58:12.217 --> 00:58:13.938]  And that also help us fund our operation.
[00:58:14.038 --> 00:58:14.518]  I sell it.
[00:58:14.739 --> 00:58:20.081]  And if you take the Alexa Pure Pro Gravity-Fed Stainless Steel Water Filtration System, they ordered too many this year.
[00:58:20.261 --> 00:58:22.042]  They want to sell them so they don't have inventory problems.
[00:58:22.082 --> 00:58:23.243]  They have to pay tax on that.
[00:58:23.283 --> 00:58:24.904]  So they're selling them to us at cost.
[00:58:25.024 --> 00:58:26.605]  We make 30-something bucks on these.
[00:58:26.845 --> 00:58:28.966]  I've never seen anything like this.
[00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:32.028]  This deal is beyond the best you'll ever find.
[00:58:32.148 --> 00:58:35.670]  Alexa Pure Pro, and it's part of our Cyber Week Sale.
[00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:37.451]  50 to 75% off.

[00:59:15.642 --> 00:59:16.843]  And whatever you do, spread the word.
[00:59:16.903 --> 00:59:18.865]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:59:19.125 --> 00:59:23.068]  Jam it down their throat as a badge of honor to be demonized and lied about.
[00:59:23.388 --> 00:59:30.511]  The collaborators and the cowards and the filth that have all signed on to worshipping the pedophilia and worshipping the devil worship.
[00:59:30.752 --> 00:59:31.392]  Well, guess what?
[00:59:31.532 --> 00:59:42.237]  I'm real proud to be enemy number one up against these people and thank God for Trump flying that banner of Americana and no compromise and no compromise for Christianity and everything.
[00:59:42.417 --> 00:59:43.518]  God bless President Trump.
[00:59:43.838 --> 00:59:49.180]  I'm proud to stand by and watch all the other cowards hedge their bets and double talk behind the president's back.
[00:59:49.441 --> 00:59:49.821]  Not me!
[00:59:56.517 --> 01:00:00.158]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:29.010]  Welcome back.
[01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:37.655]  You know, we were just talking about how the left is having a lot of problems with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer because, unfortunately, the fictional character is bullied.
[01:00:38.456 --> 01:00:43.319]  Well, it is a story of bullying and how he overcomes it, how he embraces his differences and so forth.
[01:00:44.439 --> 01:00:47.321]  But that's not good enough for them.
[01:00:48.282 --> 01:00:49.663]  And they use the idea of bullying.
[01:00:49.683 --> 01:00:52.444]  They don't want kids to see Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[01:00:52.464 --> 01:00:53.565]  What they want them to see
[01:00:54.494 --> 01:00:56.115]  is the Drag Queen Story Hour.
[01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:59.937]  That is their prescription on how to overcome bullying.
[01:01:00.618 --> 01:01:03.059]  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, definitely out.
[01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:05.240]  Drag Queens, now in.
[01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:10.784]  And so you have a guy in Louisiana, because this is a national issue, folks.
[01:01:10.844 --> 01:01:11.924]  It's happening all over the country.
[01:01:12.004 --> 01:01:13.085]  There's probably one close to you.
[01:01:14.093 --> 01:01:25.982]  Here in Texas, in Louisiana, back in North Carolina, this guy in Louisiana, at the Lafayette Public Library, where he goes to talk to very, very young children.
[01:01:26.002 --> 01:01:27.002]  You have a problem with that?
[01:01:27.923 --> 01:01:28.243]  I do.
[01:01:28.964 --> 01:01:30.345]  And I'll tell you why I have a problem with it.
[01:01:30.385 --> 01:01:31.546]  It's what this guy has to say.
[01:01:31.766 --> 01:01:34.368]  He says, well, I'm not here to push any kind of agenda.
[01:01:34.768 --> 01:01:42.774]  I'm here to let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful, and for the children, and the people that are supporting it are going to realize this is going to be the grooming
[01:01:43.627 --> 01:01:44.708]  Of the next generation.
[01:01:45.408 --> 01:01:47.870]  We're trying to groom the next generation.
[01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:50.752]  To not see the way that they just did.
[01:01:52.814 --> 01:01:55.676]  These people are trying to get access to your children.
[01:01:56.897 --> 01:01:58.678]  And you have to understand that they're trying to groom them.
[01:01:58.698 --> 01:02:02.461]  Now he says, he typically does this as an R-rated show.
[01:02:03.702 --> 01:02:07.585]  But he says, I should have access to preschool children because I can filter myself.
[01:02:08.331 --> 01:02:11.732]  I'm able to do that because I'm an adult, and I'm able to filter myself.
[01:02:12.093 --> 01:02:18.135]  Well, these kids are not adults, and these kids can't filter and process what you're doing.
[01:02:19.295 --> 01:02:27.579]  And I have a real problem with predators like this, who put themselves in a position to come after young children.
[01:02:27.699 --> 01:02:30.760]  They are not capable of making these decisions.
[01:02:31.961 --> 01:02:37.703]  Quite frankly, I don't like strangers talking to my kids about sex, especially men who are dressed like women.
[01:02:38.894 --> 01:02:41.415]  And are obviously into some other activities.
[01:02:41.615 --> 01:02:43.055]  I don't think they should be engaged in this.
[01:02:43.115 --> 01:02:45.435]  I don't think strangers should be talking to kids about sex.
[01:02:45.475 --> 01:02:46.376]  That should be their parents.
[01:02:46.876 --> 01:02:49.056]  Introducing it to them when they are ready.
[01:02:50.416 --> 01:02:58.418]  But these people want to groom the kids because if these kids can make decisions about gender, they can make decisions about consensual sex.
[01:02:58.478 --> 01:03:00.279]  That's the whole game behind this, folks.
[01:03:00.639 --> 01:03:02.039]  That and the destruction of the family.
[01:03:02.722 --> 01:03:07.725]  You know, when we look at the fact that these people are not about tolerance, just look at this story from Daily Mail.
[01:03:07.745 --> 01:03:10.806]  You've got the guy who runs Grindr, which is basically a gay dating app.
[01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:11.627]  Grindr.
[01:03:12.487 --> 01:03:13.548]  His name is Scott Chen.
[01:03:14.608 --> 01:03:15.169]  He's Asian.
[01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:17.450]  He's in Taiwan.
[01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:20.992]  They just had a referendum on the definition of marriage.
[01:03:22.051 --> 01:03:38.435]  And he was upset about the fact that there was another CEO that was supporting anti-LGBTQ causes and had contributed in favor of this agenda that would define marriage as between a man and a woman.
[01:03:38.575 --> 01:03:44.256]  Now this guy is saying, he runs a gay dating app, he says, I don't want the government to define this or prohibit this in any way.
[01:03:44.756 --> 01:03:48.417]  And he was actually saying he was going to boycott this other person.
[01:03:48.497 --> 01:03:50.478]  But in the process of talking about this,
[01:03:51.198 --> 01:03:57.623]  He made remarks saying that, he said, there are people like me that believe that marriage is holy matrimony between a man and a woman.
[01:03:59.184 --> 01:04:00.185]  And he's got a couple of kids.
[01:04:01.626 --> 01:04:09.051]  And so now the people that he was defending and showing tolerance for are now coming after him.
[01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:11.473]  Because they're not about tolerance.
[01:04:12.054 --> 01:04:12.994]  They have an agenda.
[01:04:13.855 --> 01:04:17.718]  This is, they do not want you to merely tolerate what they do.
[01:04:18.752 --> 01:04:19.613]  See, that's the problem.
[01:04:19.653 --> 01:04:26.422]  They want to demand that you conform to them and celebrate what they do and change your way of life.
[01:04:26.743 --> 01:04:33.151]  Anybody that doesn't embrace what they do, celebrate what they do, will be purged out of the public square.
[01:04:34.321 --> 01:04:40.285]  And quite frankly, we have something even more dangerous coming, and I'll tell you about that later in the program.
[01:04:41.126 --> 01:04:53.195]  As James Dobson of Focus on the Family points out, the new renegotiated NAFTA has got language in it about gender that Obama and his administration would be proud of.
[01:04:53.355 --> 01:05:02.081]  What is that doing is another example of why we should have gotten rid of NAFTA altogether instead of reforming it.
[01:05:05.106 --> 01:05:06.426]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:06.466 --> 01:05:16.028]  Before we head back into some more news stories, I want to tell you about the great specials available at InfoWarsStore.com right now, where we have the Cyber Week special running.

[01:05:52.047 --> 01:05:53.008]  Please support us.
[01:05:53.168 --> 01:05:56.470]  They're trying to undermine us financially, sabotage us at every available opportunity.
[01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:57.130]  We're good to go.
[01:06:28.197 --> 01:06:31.199]  Welcome back!
[01:06:31.239 --> 01:06:37.141]  You know, we've had a lot of news within the last week about what's going on between Ukraine and Russia.
[01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:50.786]  Four years ago, we had the revolution there, and there was a lot of discussion about Victoria Nuland's State Department involvement there and so forth, but there were revelations that came out, and Politico
[01:06:52.039 --> 01:07:01.422]  We're talking about the efforts of the DNC to work with a foreign country and to rig our elections.
[01:07:01.522 --> 01:07:06.043]  And we're not talking about the Trump campaign and Russia.
[01:07:06.203 --> 01:07:11.965]  We're talking about the DNC, Alexandria Chalupa, and the Ukrainian government at the time.
[01:07:13.025 --> 01:07:16.606]  And we have a guy on with us now, Andrei Peloshenko.
[01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:20.959]  He was quoted by Politico, many other organizations.
[01:07:21.039 --> 01:07:25.761]  Actually, he's held quite a number of high-ranking positions in the Ukrainian government.
[01:07:26.921 --> 01:07:30.103]  But he is an honest whistleblower, and he's had to pay the price on that.
[01:07:30.143 --> 01:07:38.726]  I want to talk to him about what the current situation in the Ukraine is, but I also want to get back to talk a little bit about this overlooked
[01:07:40.075 --> 01:07:42.397]  Uh, conspiracy as part of this.
[01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:47.900]  You know, it's another example of how we investigate one thing for which there is no evidence now.
[01:07:48.741 --> 01:08:02.169]  Even after a couple of years, as Jake Tapper was even saying, uh, when he was talking to Gerald Nadler, he said, but, but okay, you may not like these hotel deals that are going on in Russia, but there's no evidence of a conspiracy.
[01:08:03.038 --> 01:08:04.620]  I mean, even Jake Tapper is saying that.
[01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:11.469]  But there is quite a bit of evidence of conspiracy in the Ukraine, and I want to talk to Andrei Teleshchenko about that.
[01:08:11.529 --> 01:08:16.956]  Again, he has had a number of positions there in the Ukrainian government.
[01:08:16.997 --> 01:08:20.201]  He was advisor in foreign affairs, the former prosecutor general of Ukraine.
[01:08:21.011 --> 01:08:23.995]  He was associated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ukraine.
[01:08:24.035 --> 01:08:30.122]  He was also part of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, part of the Prosecutor General's Office.
[01:08:30.162 --> 01:08:32.384]  I'm going back many years of experience in government there.
[01:08:32.404 --> 01:08:35.948]  He was also with the Ukrainian Embassy here in the United States.
[01:08:36.509 --> 01:08:37.771]  Thank you for joining us, Andrei.
[01:08:38.595 --> 01:08:39.055]  Thank you, David.
[01:08:39.876 --> 01:08:40.736]  Did I leave anything out?
[01:08:40.776 --> 01:08:55.807]  Tell me, in terms of your resume, primarily at the time that this was happening, you were aware of what was going on with Alexandria Chalupa and her work for the DNC in your official capacity at that time, right?
[01:08:56.867 --> 01:09:01.651]  Yes, I personally had a chance to meet her in the end of March, beginning of April 2016.
[01:09:04.364 --> 01:09:12.371]  And it was, I was recommended to meet with her by a DCM at the Embassy, Oksana Shular, at one of the lunch meetings.
[01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:14.473]  And that's when I got introduced to her.
[01:09:14.613 --> 01:09:18.096]  We met, we talked, and she introduced what she was doing and her work.
[01:09:19.554 --> 01:09:22.896]  Yeah, and of course that was reported in detail by Politico.
[01:09:23.336 --> 01:09:24.777]  We got documents from WikiLeaks.
[01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:28.020]  Alexandra Chalupa openly talked about what she was doing.
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:28.740]  You talked about it.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.443]  But we just saw a couple of months ago when Bob Woodward's book, Fear, came out.
[01:09:33.943 --> 01:09:44.470]  He had quotes there where he said, as President Trump tweeted out, isn't anybody going to look at this other effort by a foreign government to work with a political party, the Democrats, to rig the election?
[01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:45.391]  Nobody's going to look at that?
[01:09:46.235 --> 01:09:46.695]  And H.R.
[01:09:46.736 --> 01:09:59.004]  McMaster, according to Bob Woodward in his book, Fear, said, you know, this is nothing but the President pushing out another Russian conspiracy, essentially accusing you of being a Russian agent.
[01:09:59.785 --> 01:10:02.227]  But right now, you're not in the Ukraine, are you?
[01:10:03.407 --> 01:10:09.011]  No, I had to leave Ukraine due to political threats and pressure.
[01:10:09.392 --> 01:10:12.234]  And I went to the United States first, and now I'm back in Europe.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:27.823]  And so, you're not a Russian agent, but the Ukrainian government is, again, and that's what I want to talk about because of what happened this last weekend.
[01:10:28.143 --> 01:10:41.306]  Actually, a couple of weeks ago, before this incident at the Kerch Strait that has escalated tensions there and has caused Ukraine to go into martial law, we had the foreign minister
[01:10:42.409 --> 01:10:53.116]  of Ukraine come and meet with Mike Pompeo and they were talking about how they had to pay special attention to this particular straight.
[01:10:53.696 --> 01:10:57.779]  As I talked about this on Monday, it appeared to me to be an act of provocation.
[01:10:57.859 --> 01:11:03.563]  But regardless of that, tell us a little bit about the conditions in Ukraine.
[01:11:05.944 --> 01:11:11.028]  Many of us are suspicious about martial law being imposed there because of the low popularity
[01:11:11.888 --> 01:11:31.260]  Yeah, the problem with the Zof C and the Kerch Strait is that it has to be first fully investigated by all sides and then taking that into action, you have to get further results done.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.582]  But what happened with Martial Law?
[01:11:34.503 --> 01:11:36.288]  This Monday it was total chaos.
[01:11:36.328 --> 01:11:41.841]  President Poroshenko with an 8% rating tried to impose martial law all over Ukraine.
[01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:45.824]  Which would give him a chance to stay in power for six more months.
[01:11:46.424 --> 01:11:46.624]  Yeah.
[01:11:46.804 --> 01:11:55.807]  I knew about this process since spring this year and I spoke about this when I was in Kiev to embassy officials from European, U.S.
[01:11:55.907 --> 01:12:04.930]  embassies and nobody would take it into real action that this might have happened, but it happened this Monday and without any other
[01:12:06.245 --> 01:12:08.606]  We had worse issues before.
[01:12:08.646 --> 01:12:15.510]  We had people die every day in the east of Donetsk, Ukraine.
[01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:23.854]  More than 400 people died in one day during the bouts of Ilovaisk, and nothing was imposed on such matter before.
[01:12:24.274 --> 01:12:25.095]  But today, because
[01:12:26.452 --> 01:12:41.908]  36 days before the election, they tried to impose, the election campaign started, they tried to impose martial law all over Ukraine and to postpone the election for six months, having the president win more time, and with the fear of war over the people, try to build up his rating.
[01:12:42.408 --> 01:12:46.833]  And this is the, this would be the first election since the Madan Revolution four years ago, back in 2014.
[01:12:50.954 --> 01:12:51.675]  Presidential, yes.
[01:12:51.915 --> 01:12:56.258]  There was an election to the parliament before, which went pretty smoothly.
[01:12:57.019 --> 01:13:01.662]  But this is going to be the first election for the president as of Maidan.
[01:13:02.043 --> 01:13:04.945]  And so he's at 8% in the opinion polls.
[01:13:06.146 --> 01:13:13.332]  And again, something else that is happening there and was talked about when the foreign minister of Ukraine came here and talked to Pompeo.
[01:13:14.453 --> 01:13:18.176]  ...was the gas pipeline that Russia and Turkey are trying to run through.
[01:13:18.196 --> 01:13:23.120]  That was something that was about to happen four years ago, back in 2014, when the revolution happened.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.142]  It was starting to start up again.
[01:13:25.522 --> 01:13:27.944]  So there were multiple things that were going on that the U.S.
[01:13:28.084 --> 01:13:38.233]  and Poroshenko were aware of, and this allows him to stop the election that he's not in too good a shape for.
[01:13:38.613 --> 01:13:40.357]  But talk to us a little bit about the economy.
[01:13:40.377 --> 01:13:45.808]  How has the economy been over the last four years under his leadership in the Ukraine?
[01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:50.178]  The economy started to default a couple of times.
[01:13:50.198 --> 01:13:52.920]  We had a process of default a couple of times in Ukraine.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:14:07.090]  Last one was this October, before the IMF gave us the latest tranche of virtual money to Ukraine, and that's when Ukraine was basically almost in an economical shutdown.
[01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:14.615]  And the economy, because of the war, it is bad, but we are seeing that
[01:14:15.447 --> 01:14:18.969]  We're trying to, Ukrainian government is trying to listen more and more to IMF.
[01:14:19.169 --> 01:14:29.496]  They're just bending over, I apologize for my words, to IMF and just asking for money every time, even though they're spending them all over the place.
[01:14:29.536 --> 01:14:38.422]  There's also a lot of spending into such agencies as NABU, where the US is financing, but still there's no results.
[01:14:38.842 --> 01:14:43.505]  And as we can see today, the Poroshenko government with his
[01:14:44.435 --> 01:14:49.971]  As he says, best financial financiers who are working with the West is not capable of doing anything.
[01:14:50.011 --> 01:14:52.358]  The dollar is rising every time.
[01:14:53.343 --> 01:15:03.966]  And it rose 30% the first year, and now it's risen 45-55% as of this year, and people's salaries are less and less every time.
[01:15:04.006 --> 01:15:08.187]  They have to pay more money for communal services, which they don't have money to pay.
[01:15:08.207 --> 01:15:14.528]  The salary in Ukraine right now is $300 a month, the minimum salary in Ukraine.
[01:15:14.788 --> 01:15:15.028]  Wow.
[01:15:15.228 --> 01:15:15.448]  Wow.
[01:15:15.588 --> 01:15:19.989]  Ukraine is one of the poorest countries in Europe at this point, is it?
[01:15:20.029 --> 01:15:20.910]  Unfortunately, yes.
[01:15:24.207 --> 01:15:26.568]  I'm a Ukrainian and I'm a person who worked for the government.
[01:15:27.069 --> 01:15:33.671]  For me it's a heartbreak to see that our economy is one of the poorest and one of the worst economies in Europe.
[01:15:34.211 --> 01:15:45.116]  And you've been quoted by Newsweek, we've got to take a quick break and we'll come back, but you've been quoted by Newsweek concerned at not only the level of the economy but the fact that
[01:15:45.817 --> 01:15:47.779]  Uh, ties with Russia we're actually building.
[01:15:47.819 --> 01:15:52.706]  And you were saying, we need to be breaking away from Russia and establishing our economic, uh, independence.
[01:15:52.766 --> 01:15:54.168]  So we'll talk a little bit more about that.
[01:15:54.729 --> 01:15:59.636]  And then we'll get back into, uh, some of the other politics that are still bubbling below the surface.
[01:16:00.497 --> 01:16:02.099]  Uh, here we are a couple of years after the election.
[01:16:02.426 --> 01:16:12.682]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[01:16:13.083 --> 01:16:14.545]  And as we prepare to close out 2018,
[01:16:16.787 --> 01:16:25.139]  Isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:32.810]  Or to say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man, well that's dead naming.
[01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:41.136]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:44.659]  Then they say it's racist to say no, that it's okay to be white.
[01:16:45.019 --> 01:16:47.801]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation or borders.
[01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:50.923]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[01:16:51.364 --> 01:16:55.006]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[01:16:55.847 --> 01:16:57.808]  World War III was the Cold War.
[01:16:59.189 --> 01:17:00.871]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[01:17:01.271 --> 01:17:02.512]  And now in this fourth war,
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:18.914]  It's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[01:17:18.954 --> 01:17:26.941]  Because the globalists are threatened by first world nations, they're threatened by the middle class, they're threatened by the uppity-ness
[01:17:28.351 --> 01:17:29.612]  Of free market capitalism.
[01:17:30.193 --> 01:17:34.236]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[01:17:34.977 --> 01:17:36.578]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[01:17:37.038 --> 01:17:39.781]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[01:17:40.841 --> 01:17:42.163]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[01:17:42.243 --> 01:17:46.466]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[01:17:47.007 --> 01:17:49.769]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[01:17:51.254 --> 01:17:57.377]  But the globalists are counter-striking against independent patriot nationalist media like InfoWars.
[01:17:57.398 --> 01:18:02.821]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective thanks to your support.
[01:18:03.641 --> 01:18:04.662]  You have been the most effective.
[01:18:05.789 --> 01:18:07.332]  At exposing what's really happening.
[01:18:07.953 --> 01:18:12.259]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.205]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:20.832]  And I wanted just to remind you that Importers isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[01:18:22.028 --> 01:18:23.149]  And without you, we won't be here.
[01:18:23.749 --> 01:18:27.751]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[01:18:28.952 --> 01:18:31.293]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:40.538]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[01:18:40.618 --> 01:18:43.280]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.801]  A tax would take an hour to go over, just some of it.
[01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:56.345]  But you standing with us and buying the great products at InfoWareStore.com helps you, and it also helps us get the word out, so it's symbiotic, a non-zero-sum game.
[01:18:56.926 --> 01:18:58.106]  The globalists are the opposite.
[01:18:58.146 --> 01:19:08.290]  They see everything as a win-lose proposition, and they are hyper-aggressive, hyper-alpha to a point of absolute spiritual evil.
[01:19:08.971 --> 01:19:09.571]  So right now,
[01:19:10.191 --> 01:19:26.859]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[01:19:27.339 --> 01:19:38.584]  And you are provisioning and funding not just the second American revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[01:19:39.384 --> 01:19:40.485]  Forced sterilization.
[01:19:40.845 --> 01:19:42.146]  Children being sterilized.
[01:19:42.626 --> 01:19:45.587]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[01:19:45.707 --> 01:19:49.449]  And Infowars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[01:19:49.749 --> 01:19:52.070]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[01:19:52.331 --> 01:19:53.811]  And we will fight until the end.
[01:19:54.252 --> 01:19:56.533]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[01:19:56.593 --> 01:19:58.714]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.275]  And thank you all for your support.
[01:20:00.475 --> 01:20:00.895]  God bless you.
[01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:09.013]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:35.166 --> 01:20:37.228]  Welcome back, we're talking to Andrei Kalashnikov.
[01:20:38.289 --> 01:20:42.272]  He has worked in many government positions for the Ukraine government.
[01:20:42.652 --> 01:20:44.213]  He was with the Ukraine's U.S.
[01:20:44.333 --> 01:20:46.014]  Embassy here in the United States.
[01:20:47.095 --> 01:20:59.245]  As part of his involvement with the Ukrainian government, he was aware of efforts to try to rig the election against President Trump.
[01:20:59.285 --> 01:21:03.748]  They were trying to use the Democrats are trying to get Ukraine involved in
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.941]  Trying to rig the election against President Trump.
[01:21:06.961 --> 01:21:09.241]  Now, of course, it was reported by WikiLeaks.
[01:21:09.261 --> 01:21:11.022]  It was reported by Politico.
[01:21:11.082 --> 01:21:12.423]  They did a very in-depth article.
[01:21:13.023 --> 01:21:13.703]  He talked about it.
[01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:16.484]  Alexandria Chalupa had no problem talking about it.
[01:21:16.584 --> 01:21:18.625]  But, of course, H.R.
[01:21:18.645 --> 01:21:31.369]  McMaster and the Ukrainian embassy, those people who are the neocons trying to overthrow the election here in this country, pushed back against it, said, oh, it's nothing but Russian propaganda and a conspiracy theory.
[01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:32.470]  It isn't.
[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:36.193]  Andre is an honest man.
[01:21:37.214 --> 01:21:39.536]  Quite frankly, Lee Stranahan tracked him down.
[01:21:39.556 --> 01:21:47.705]  It took him quite a while to track him down after seeing the reports, talking to him on Politico as well as others with Newsweek.
[01:21:47.965 --> 01:21:49.947]  He said, let's get some more information from this guy.
[01:21:49.967 --> 01:21:52.310]  It took him a very long time from what Lee told me.
[01:21:52.990 --> 01:22:03.774]  He had to get to Andre through some common Christian friends, kind of find a network there, and now he's had to pay the price for talking honestly about what was going on.
[01:22:03.814 --> 01:22:09.596]  But I want to get back to the current state right now before we go back into the politics of what happened in 2016.
[01:22:10.076 --> 01:22:11.136]  Andre, you had talked to Newsweek.
[01:22:15.558 --> 01:22:26.261]  And you were talking about the economic ties that continued to escalate between Ukraine and Russia at the time just a year or so ago, I guess, and you said from your point of view it was a step backwards.
[01:22:26.321 --> 01:22:38.224]  Tell us a little bit about that, what your concern is about the fact that there was increased trade between Russia, that the Russian sphere of influence was continuing to actually increase even after the revolution four years ago.
[01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:43.777]  It's the problem not with Russia or any other country that we trade with.
[01:22:43.857 --> 01:22:57.867]  It's the problem that we are in a war with a country which is fighting against us and which is asking other countries to sanction them and not to trade with them and not to have any economical ties with them.
[01:22:57.927 --> 01:23:07.934]  But on the other side, official Kiev in Ukraine under the president Poroshenko is building up its trade with Russia, that official aggressor, as they
[01:23:08.767 --> 01:23:10.048]  We're good to go.
[01:23:28.923 --> 01:23:36.888]  And again, we recognize that when they talk about men between the ages of 16 and 60, that has universally been understood for hundreds of years as the militia.
[01:23:36.948 --> 01:23:38.930]  You know, we talk about the Second Amendment here in this country.
[01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:41.311]  People say, well, what is a militia?
[01:23:41.331 --> 01:23:42.412]  Well, it's not the National Guard.
[01:23:42.472 --> 01:23:44.233]  It's everybody between the ages of 16 and 60.
[01:23:44.873 --> 01:23:48.636]  And that's exactly what they're looking at in the Ukrainian situation.
[01:23:49.376 --> 01:23:58.060]  They are beating the drums of war saying there's an imminent Russian invasion that is coming and that's the justification for martial law.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.481]  I'm not sure that's the case.
[01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:07.064]  I think it's more likely an attempt to manipulate the election, you know, and I think that Pompeo is going to return the favor.
[01:24:07.444 --> 01:24:08.867]  And the deep state here in the United States.
[01:24:08.947 --> 01:24:12.011]  The Ukrainians tried to manipulate our election two years ago.
[01:24:12.052 --> 01:24:14.455]  Now we're returning the favor trying to help them.
[01:24:14.475 --> 01:24:22.288]  They also want to stop the pipeline that is about to go through again, just like the pipeline is a big part of what's going on in Syria.
[01:24:23.268 --> 01:24:34.894]  And I think it was very effective at this particular time for them to be able to stop any communication between President Trump and Putin at the G20 that began today.
[01:24:34.914 --> 01:24:41.518]  He is now backed off of that because of allegations from Mueller and because of what happened this last weekend.
[01:24:44.219 --> 01:24:50.144]  In the past, we've always said that it's a good thing for the superpowers, the United States and Russia, to have discussion between each other.
[01:24:50.164 --> 01:24:54.527]  You know, they've got 90% of the world's nuclear weapons, so detente is a good thing.
[01:24:54.547 --> 01:24:55.168]  But no longer.
[01:24:55.248 --> 01:24:56.429]  We can't have that kind of discussion.
[01:24:56.649 --> 01:24:58.290]  So they've now been able to shut that down.
[01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:07.618]  They've got a lot of goals here that seem to be served by this narrative that came out of this situation over the weekend.
[01:25:08.118 --> 01:25:08.659]  Your comments?
[01:25:10.343 --> 01:25:14.466]  First of all, there's no threat right now of Russia invading Ukraine.
[01:25:14.486 --> 01:25:15.687]  Nobody wants war today.
[01:25:16.787 --> 01:25:26.153]  There was a big threat in 2014 when I was in government and we were working on this issue overseeing security services in Ukraine in the military.
[01:25:26.193 --> 01:25:27.034]  There was a threat then.
[01:25:27.194 --> 01:25:28.915]  Today, there's a stable
[01:25:30.734 --> 01:25:36.376]  Military presence of Russian military on the border of Ukraine, but there's no imminent threat of invasion.
[01:25:36.656 --> 01:25:52.142]  So this is what they're doing today of blocking anybody going into Ukraine age of 16 to 60 is just to make a show for the people that they're doing something and to have opposed threats and people being fear war, which is just total chaos.
[01:25:52.202 --> 01:25:54.783]  And this is unacceptable in a democratic country.
[01:25:55.403 --> 01:26:06.808]  And I think the West should at least oppose to this, and I was trying to let this go through the other news channels and official and unofficial channels here in Ukraine and in Washington.
[01:26:07.168 --> 01:26:13.491]  Please stop Korshenko of using dictatorship methods, which even Yanukovych didn't use, which he fought against.
[01:26:14.111 --> 01:26:16.392]  Yeah, and this is one of the oldest plots that we've ever seen.
[01:26:16.452 --> 01:26:26.395]  Anybody that has got a shaky regime or whatever, you know, they can always appeal and consolidate everybody around them if they start a war, or if they say that a war is imminent.
[01:26:26.455 --> 01:26:28.655]  That's the oldest ploy on the book.
[01:26:28.835 --> 01:26:30.176]  We've seen this over and over again.
[01:26:30.616 --> 01:26:37.378]  I'm very suspicious that that is the key goal behind all of this, and it would be a shame, it'd be a tragedy
[01:26:38.198 --> 01:26:40.199]  Uh, to see, uh, war being pushed.
[01:26:40.219 --> 01:26:43.480]  We've got Nikki Haley out there saying, we're going to slap the Russians around anytime we want to.
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.320]  They really do want war.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:49.022]  They really want to get us involved in the war, but especially the people there on the ground.
[01:26:49.042 --> 01:26:55.504]  I mean, we've seen the tragedy in Syria when people like Nikki Haley get involved, and I don't want to see that happening again here in the Ukraine.
[01:26:55.524 --> 01:26:56.384]  I'm sure you don't either.
[01:26:57.344 --> 01:26:59.227]  No, nobody wants a new war here happening.
[01:26:59.367 --> 01:27:12.044]  Everybody wants peace talks and this to end for both countries, as for Russia, as for Ukraine, to stop this war and to everybody live their own lives, which I was trying to also
[01:27:12.444 --> 01:27:27.177]  But the United States has had to join the Normandy format in 2014 for us to end it much faster today, as you said already, trying to break away those ties between President Trump and Putin and to have those countries not talk.
[01:27:28.378 --> 01:27:33.801]  Which can deal with this issue more faster than the European countries involved with Ukraine.
[01:27:34.141 --> 01:27:37.083]  Yeah, that would be one way to defuse this, but they don't want it defused.
[01:27:37.123 --> 01:27:38.825]  You're saying nobody wants this.
[01:27:38.845 --> 01:27:40.786]  Well, that's nobody in Ukraine that wants this.
[01:27:41.446 --> 01:27:43.548]  Nobody who's actually going to be involved in this.
[01:27:43.568 --> 01:27:48.471]  But there's a lot of people at the upper levels of our government and the Ukrainian government who do want this.
[01:27:48.531 --> 01:27:55.316]  Now, we've got to take a break coming up in a few minutes, but let's start to talk a little bit about what you saw
[01:27:55.876 --> 01:28:01.117]  Going back in the 2016 election, because we've had this dismissed by H.R.
[01:28:01.577 --> 01:28:11.280]  McMaster as nothing but a Russian conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians were working with the Democrats against Trump to try to rig the election against Trump.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:19.382]  Tell us a little bit about what you saw there as you were, as Alexandra Chalupa, the DNC operative, was coming to the Ukraine.
[01:28:19.782 --> 01:28:20.442]  What was she looking for?
[01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:28.265]  A couple words on the Woodward book and McMaster's response to President Trump that I'm a Russian propaganda or this article was part of Russian propaganda.
[01:28:28.665 --> 01:28:32.626]  First of all, I was never even reached out by anybody, no, any authorities in the U.S.
[01:28:32.926 --> 01:28:34.767]  or here in Ukraine to talk about this issue.
[01:28:35.167 --> 01:28:47.911]  And what I was telling you about what Chalupa told me in that meeting, it was total interference in the elections, asking the foreign government to help and have fine dirt on one of the presidential candidates at that time, Donald Trump.
[01:28:48.191 --> 01:28:49.091]  We're going to have more about that.
[01:28:49.111 --> 01:28:50.952]  We've got to take a quick break, but more about that.
[01:28:51.472 --> 01:28:55.674]  He saw what was going on and he said, this is very dangerous.
[01:28:55.694 --> 01:28:56.615]  It's highly illegal.
[01:28:56.635 --> 01:28:57.635]  I'm not going to be a part of it.
[01:28:58.215 --> 01:29:00.236]  And got out of that and blew the whistle on it.
[01:29:00.416 --> 01:29:01.416]  And he's now paying the price.
[01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:02.017]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:02.517]  Stay with us.
[01:29:11.537 --> 01:29:27.778]  Brandon Darby is the editor of Breitbart Texas at Brandon Darby on Twitter Breitbart.com forward slash author forward slash Brandon Darby of course you can find his work it's usually on the front page of Breitbart and he goes into Mexico and some of the most dangerous no-go zones
[01:29:27.938 --> 01:29:36.560]  Perfect time to get him on to talk about the 5,000 they report in Tijuana trying to get into the U.S., the 35 million in the last 20 years that have already gotten in.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.541]  But these are different.
[01:29:37.561 --> 01:29:39.701]  They're totally more and more being politically motivated.
[01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:43.302]  Before, there was a lot of folks actually fleeing carnage, and some of these people are doing that as well.
[01:29:43.322 --> 01:29:48.743]  But the media keeps showing images of a woman and two children instead of the fact that they're almost all military-age men.
[01:29:48.903 --> 01:29:50.804]  So, Brandon Darby, thank you for joining us.
[01:29:51.044 --> 01:29:52.325]  Hey, thank you for having me on, Arlen.
[01:29:52.485 --> 01:29:53.586]  Well, Fulton Center exists.
[01:29:53.766 --> 01:30:04.735]  We have to remember that over the last year, we've had an estimated 1,200 people, either illegally or regularly, and that is up for debate because some of them cross and turn themselves in.
[01:30:04.795 --> 01:30:06.096]  But we've had an average of 1,200.
[01:30:06.476 --> 01:30:07.176]  We're good to go.
[01:30:36.516 --> 01:30:37.316]  We're good to go.
[01:30:57.521 --> 01:30:57.841]  I think so.
[01:31:13.871 --> 01:31:17.472]  A couple of very irresponsible parents had their kids in the mix of that.
[01:31:17.612 --> 01:31:30.196]  Mainstream media has decided to focus on the kids and the women holding two kids fleeing in that image and not just the photos of life-threatening fall-sized rocks being thrown at our agents as military-aged men.
[01:31:30.436 --> 01:31:31.116]  We're good to go.
[01:32:00.273 --> 01:32:00.814]  I think?
[01:32:15.609 --> 01:32:32.295]  Need to keep in mind, uh, when we're talking about this, and especially if someone out there is a liberal and they're listening, whether because they're just interested or whether because they're trying to wait for one of us to say something and use it against us or whatever they do, they need to understand that this was 10% of the caravan who did this and engaged in this behavior.
[01:32:32.375 --> 01:32:36.256]  There's another 90% who decided not to engage in this behavior.
[01:32:36.516 --> 01:32:42.838]  And, uh, rather than defending that 90%, which are telling their stories, which I could understand, there's some that's underdog.
[01:32:42.858 --> 01:32:43.678]  That's understandable.
[01:32:43.999 --> 01:32:53.383]  Media is choosing to focus and defend these rock-throwing military-aged men who used a couple of women and children as human shields or as media ploys.
[01:32:53.784 --> 01:32:56.245]  And I think that's just the most bizarre thing I've ever heard of.
[01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:08.411]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.505 --> 01:33:27.853]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.234 --> 01:33:31.156]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:33:31.757 --> 01:33:36.381]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight and we're talking to Andrei Talashenko.
[01:33:40.063 --> 01:33:43.844]  He is someone who worked at high levels in the Ukrainian diplomatic corps.
[01:33:43.984 --> 01:33:51.487]  He was there when Alexandra Chalupa was trying to get information to help rig the election against President Trump.
[01:33:51.947 --> 01:34:07.472]  But as we've been talking about in the last couple of segments, at this particular time, as things are so desperate in Ukraine, economically, and of course because of the bad economic situation there, the President is not in a good situation.
[01:34:08.092 --> 01:34:10.954]  The Ukrainian president is now at an 8% approval rating.
[01:34:11.515 --> 01:34:13.376]  They have elections coming up in a couple of months.
[01:34:13.476 --> 01:34:19.061]  By declaring martial law, he's now been able to delay these elections for another six months.
[01:34:19.921 --> 01:34:35.274]  Now, they've been demanding sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, and yet, as Andrei has pointed out to Newsweek and other places, it is counterproductive for the Ukrainian government to be increasing trade with the Russians as they call on everybody else to do sanctions.
[01:34:35.914 --> 01:34:50.411]  As they've had a lot of fighting at the border, and people haven't really paid any attention to that in the past, at the moment, even though things are tense, there is no fighting, no incursion that's going on, and yet they are trying to build this up as if there is an imminent invasion.
[01:34:50.952 --> 01:34:51.412]  While...
[01:34:52.333 --> 01:35:02.442]  At the same time, putting pressure on President Trump not to talk to Putin at the G20, and try to defuse this in a situation that could be very productive.
[01:35:02.882 --> 01:35:09.107]  It apparently looks like people want to, the President wants to delay this election, they want to escalate war.
[01:35:09.748 --> 01:35:16.253]  There's other things involved as well, the pipeline there, but I want to go back to what Andrei Talashenko saw.
[01:35:17.294 --> 01:35:26.641]  In the 2016 election, as we had the DNC operative, the Ukrainian-American Alexandra Chalupa, go to the Ukraine.
[01:35:27.402 --> 01:35:29.904]  Andre, what did you witness firsthand?
[01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:30.704]  What was she trying to do?
[01:35:30.764 --> 01:35:38.370]  What was she asking when she came to the Ukraine and was talking to people there about getting information about President Trump, about Paul Manafort?
[01:35:40.018 --> 01:35:43.500]  I first, as I said, I first met her end of March, beginning of April 2016.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:49.344]  I was at the Embassy of Ukraine in Washington overseeing the elections process.
[01:35:49.364 --> 01:35:59.530]  It's a normal procedure, but when after the meeting with her, which I was introduced by the CM Oksana Shigar, the right-hand man of Ambassador Chaly,
[01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:15.076]  She asked me to get fine dirt on the presidential candidate Donald Trump because I used to work in the prosecutor's office before and I had contacts in the security service of Ukraine, which maybe she thought I would be more helpful.
[01:36:15.934 --> 01:36:24.437]  Unfortunately, after that meeting with Aleksandr Chalupa, I started investigating and negotiating with, talking to Ambassador Chaly, that what are we doing?
[01:36:24.577 --> 01:36:31.699]  Is this just a one-time meeting or there were reports done before by Chalupa in Ukraine or at the embassy?
[01:36:31.779 --> 01:36:34.680]  And he told me that they talked to her pretty often.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:41.382]  She's at the embassy every week and she even went to Ukraine trying to look and find dirt on President Donald Trump.
[01:36:41.442 --> 01:36:41.602]  Yeah.
[01:36:57.735 --> 01:37:04.984]  That's illegal to interfere, not only not illegally politically, but also illegal to interfere in elections.
[01:37:05.184 --> 01:37:10.931]  And I got into a big dispute with the embassy and our government and I had to leave.
[01:37:11.211 --> 01:37:15.977]  I left on my own, went back to Ukraine and tried to push this issue through unofficial channels, but I was not heard.
[01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:35.804]  And before the elections, I talked to political journalists and that's when I revealed the story publicly, which there's more to it, but I don't want to talk to it without any authorities involved because there's more to it and there's not only Alexander Chalupachaly, there's more government officials from Ukraine involved in this story.
[01:37:36.611 --> 01:37:37.491]  And that's the key thing.
[01:37:38.151 --> 01:37:39.532]  This story has been buried.
[01:37:40.132 --> 01:37:48.914]  And I think President Trump, even though he understands, because a little bit of this has been reported by Politico and some other sources, he hasn't really seen the full extent of this.
[01:37:49.654 --> 01:37:57.676]  I think that, you know, we understand that McMaster and other people in the Trump administration have been very effective in terms of hiding information from him.
[01:37:57.736 --> 01:38:04.197]  I would even say, go so far as to say, he's been gaslighted on a lot of this stuff, been given misinformation about a lot of this.
[01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:06.277]  You saw this firsthand.
[01:38:07.238 --> 01:38:14.360]  You pulled back from this because you realized that it was illegal, it was unethical, and you became a whistleblower.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:18.761]  And as we typically see, whistleblowers become the targets of investigation.
[01:38:18.841 --> 01:38:22.902]  Whenever you expose criminal activity, the criminal activity doesn't stop.
[01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:24.322]  Nobody comes after the criminals.
[01:38:24.943 --> 01:38:27.343]  The system typically comes after you.
[01:38:27.383 --> 01:38:29.604]  What happened to you as you exposed this information?
[01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:33.592]  Basically, I was not even talked to or investigated.
[01:38:33.612 --> 01:38:42.021]  I know a lot of people due to my line of work at the Embassy of the United States here in Kiev, and which, no, I tried to reach out to them.
[01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:48.368]  They said, we don't want to talk about this topic at all because there's an FBI office in every embassy in the United States around the world.
[01:38:48.668 --> 01:38:52.172]  And they basically blocked me and they started to block me through my line of work.
[01:38:52.932 --> 01:38:58.975]  And the President and his team, or Schenker's team, tried to block my contacts.
[01:38:59.035 --> 01:39:01.296]  They tried to threaten people who I work with.
[01:39:02.137 --> 01:39:05.038]  But I was never investigated, nor in the U.S., nor in Kiev.
[01:39:05.638 --> 01:39:11.401]  And I know a lot of people in Washington also do a lot of work for the Democratic Party, Republican Party.
[01:39:11.901 --> 01:39:38.656]  Nobody would want to listen to this because they tried to portray me as a Russian spy, which I'm not because I'm not the last time I was in Russia was 2006 as I believe I was still a student and that was after this I'm actually not able to go to Russia because I'm really good contacts with Boris himself who passed away as we know a couple years ago and who was killed and after this I cannot go to Russia because I will be imprisoned or not being
[01:39:39.409 --> 01:39:46.573]  Well, it's gotten to the point where anybody that opposes the narrative of the Democrats or the establishment is accused of being a Russian agent.
[01:39:46.633 --> 01:39:50.074]  If you are talking on Twitter, they immediately accuse you of being a Russian bot.
[01:39:50.915 --> 01:39:58.198]  They have, you know, the DNC passes your name to Twitter and Twitter takes you off of, suspends or bans your account.
[01:39:58.258 --> 01:40:01.760]  I mean, this is the kind of repression that we're now seeing.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:06.102]  And I think it'd be very important for President Trump, people in his administration, to find out what you have to say.
[01:40:06.602 --> 01:40:07.963]  That's the amazing thing to me about it.
[01:40:08.323 --> 01:40:19.713]  Is that the press is not that interested in general in your story and that there's not any investigation even coming from the Trump side to find out what the DNC was doing there.
[01:40:19.774 --> 01:40:27.801]  Tell us a little bit, did you see anything about the Steele dossier or find out what Chalupa was doing, any involvement there with the Steele dossier?
[01:40:28.763 --> 01:40:45.108]  Yeah, before I also seal the sea, I just want to say that the example of Ukrainian interference in the election was not only with the Chalupas, which probably was partially, is the Black Ledger book which came from Ukraine and which got Paul Manafort in prison, as we know right now.
[01:40:45.388 --> 01:40:49.549]  This is a great example and it's still not being talked about Ukrainian interference in the election.
[01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:50.229]  My part is just
[01:40:50.869 --> 01:40:51.370]  We're good.
[01:41:00.049 --> 01:41:07.432]  They had to write false statements in 2016 and 2015 while working for Orbis.
[01:41:07.572 --> 01:41:09.393]  And they didn't know it was going to be the Steele dossier.
[01:41:09.413 --> 01:41:13.814]  They didn't know it was going to be against a presidential candidate or the president.
[01:41:14.214 --> 01:41:21.517]  After you get selected, they're just paid to write fake articles and fake data, which now is being used as the Steele dossier.
[01:41:22.077 --> 01:41:28.440]  And I think after meeting Aleksandra Chalupa, her involvement in this is probably a big part.
[01:41:29.048 --> 01:41:30.189]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[01:41:30.249 --> 01:41:32.311]  And we talk about what they did to Paul Manafort.
[01:41:32.331 --> 01:41:34.833]  Of course, the Podestas were also there.
[01:41:35.693 --> 01:41:40.457]  They were also working with the previous corrupt administration there in the Ukraine.
[01:41:41.078 --> 01:41:49.304]  And a lot of people said at the time, they said, well, if they come after Manafort, they're going to have to come after the Podestas and probably a lot of people who are K Street lobbyists.
[01:41:49.344 --> 01:41:49.625]  And yet,
[01:41:50.225 --> 01:41:51.426]  That never seems to happen.
[01:41:51.546 --> 01:41:56.832]  We have an amazing double standard that continues to go on and on and on.
[01:41:56.872 --> 01:41:58.413]  That's the most amazing thing to me about it.
[01:41:58.674 --> 01:42:04.980]  But also the fact that, as you just pointed out with the Steele dossier, they've got a crew there that is just writing fiction.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:11.046]  And they can, I guess, fill in the blank of whoever they want to attach this fiction to at a later date, right?
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:20.086]  Yeah, that's the big part of it, and nobody wants to hear it from both sides, nor the Democrats nor the Republicans in Washington.
[01:42:20.126 --> 01:42:21.888]  This is what amazes me.
[01:42:21.908 --> 01:42:24.910]  I don't want to interfere in anybody's lives.
[01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:27.712]  My life was interfered in, and I had to leave because of all this.
[01:42:27.833 --> 01:42:29.934]  I waited after the article came out for a year.
[01:42:29.974 --> 01:42:30.815]  I didn't talk about it.
[01:42:31.215 --> 01:42:31.555]  I'm open.
[01:42:46.488 --> 01:42:51.011]  Well, we want to hear about it and hopefully this will get some other people interested in it as well.
[01:42:51.091 --> 01:42:52.272]  Your story needs to be told.
[01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:57.215]  People need to start looking at both sides of this and do an honest investigation.
[01:42:57.235 --> 01:42:57.956]  That's all we're asking for.
[01:42:58.056 --> 01:43:00.998]  People want to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth.
[01:43:01.098 --> 01:43:02.479]  Find out what's going on before we have a...
[01:43:02.939 --> 01:43:05.080]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:10.902]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[01:43:11.002 --> 01:43:13.422]  Thank you for telling me that.
[01:43:13.582 --> 01:43:15.543]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[01:43:16.163 --> 01:43:18.444]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[01:43:18.504 --> 01:43:19.824]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[01:43:19.844 --> 01:43:21.105]  But do you think that you demonized it?
[01:43:21.125 --> 01:43:24.846]  Jim Acosta told the President that the caravan didn't exist.
[01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:31.388]  And then, of course, they also said that it didn't exist when he pulled the microphone away and pushed the intern's arm down.
[01:43:32.344 --> 01:43:34.866]  But of course, the caravan does exist.
[01:43:35.306 --> 01:43:37.788]  There's more than 50,000 people still making their way up.
[01:43:38.208 --> 01:43:42.852]  More than 10,000 as of today are already massing on the border.
[01:43:43.372 --> 01:43:46.935]  And I have the camera crew and reporters there on the ground.
[01:43:48.303 --> 01:43:51.945]  Sending back incredible live feeds and also reports.
[01:43:52.986 --> 01:43:54.027]  But just think about that.
[01:43:54.727 --> 01:44:04.673]  Remember when the PR operative for Obama, Jonathan Gruber, bragged, thank God Americans are so stupid, thank God you have no attention span?
[01:44:05.054 --> 01:44:09.216]  You know, it's not just Jim Acosta that said that there is no caravan.
[01:44:09.497 --> 01:44:15.961]  At first they said, oh the caravans are all women and children, they're all so sweet, and then they smash over the Guatemala border into Mexico, and okay, well,
[01:44:16.857 --> 01:44:17.758]  They deserve to be here.
[01:44:18.038 --> 01:44:19.659]  And then, oh, they're not violent.
[01:44:19.679 --> 01:44:21.140]  And then, oh, it doesn't exist.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:21.780]  You're crazy.
[01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:24.022]  It's something Trump made up for the election.
[01:44:24.522 --> 01:44:32.367]  And now when Trump says, OK, we've beefed up security there, well, now he's a horrible, evil racist for not letting these people in.
[01:44:32.487 --> 01:44:35.029]  And less than 10% are women and children.
[01:44:35.650 --> 01:44:44.876]  And we catch the media cropping photos in a staged event with a woman with two kids with no shoes that just supposedly came up thousands of miles from Central and South America.
[01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.566]  And the lies go on and on from there.
[01:44:47.827 --> 01:44:53.028]  And that's why Infowars.com and Newswars.com existing is so critical.
[01:44:53.648 --> 01:45:04.110]  Because the only way for these insane lies to work, saying that there are more than two genders, saying that mother and father is bad, saying that world government doesn't exist while they're promoting it.
[01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:05.391]  All the things they're doing.
[01:45:06.111 --> 01:45:08.711]  Saying the surveillance state's a great thing, but also saying it doesn't exist.
[01:45:09.172 --> 01:45:09.732]  All this 1984 garbage.
[01:45:12.022 --> 01:45:28.881]  You can't stand being challenged at all, and that's why all over the world a reign of censorship is coming in, in a perfect storm of dying corporate media, big megacorporations, authoritarian regimes like Communist China, the EU, the Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down.
[01:45:29.984 --> 01:45:39.307]  Loyal Americans and other loyal nationalists and just people that want free market and success and know that the American system, while not perfect, has been the best the world ever saw.
[01:45:39.688 --> 01:45:48.871]  And we don't want to adopt this crony capitalist model like Communist China has done, where the heads of the party are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and the general public starving to death.
[01:45:49.711 --> 01:45:51.593]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[01:45:51.673 --> 01:45:53.095]  This is sick.
[01:45:53.495 --> 01:45:56.118]  This is an attack on common sense, an attack on logic.
[01:45:56.598 --> 01:45:58.721]  And that's why InfoWars is more important than ever.
[01:45:59.401 --> 01:46:01.704]  We've got live feeds every day with our reporters.
[01:46:02.084 --> 01:46:04.287]  It's amazing at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:46:04.967 --> 01:46:13.152]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas and this holiday season, all of you remember that without you supporting InfoWars financially, we will be shut down.
[01:46:13.592 --> 01:46:14.833]  And we make it easy to do.
[01:46:15.213 --> 01:46:16.354]  We've got amazing products.
[01:46:16.394 --> 01:46:30.062]  We've got Cyber Week going right now, extending our big mega-sells for Black Friday, while supplies last, water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements, t-shirts, books, films, it's all there, and it makes the information war possible against the globalists.
[01:46:30.102 --> 01:46:32.344]  So, I want to thank you this Christmas for your support.
[01:46:32.864 --> 01:46:34.485]  And I want to ask you for your continued support.
[01:46:34.865 --> 01:46:38.626]  It's a 360 win because these products are great, and these sales are the biggest ever.

[01:46:48.569 --> 01:46:58.733]  But whatever you do, take action today and spread the word and spread the live InfoWars links and articles past the censors, because when you take action, nothing on earth can stop you.
[01:47:06.764 --> 01:47:09.406]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:36.926 --> 01:47:42.330]  We've just had news of a raid reported by Daily Caller against a whistleblower here in the United States.
[01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:45.733]  16 FBI agents raid the home of a whistleblower, acknowledged working for the Department of Justice.
[01:47:46.473 --> 01:47:48.094]  This whistleblower, Dennis Nathan,
[01:48:04.201 --> 01:48:10.330]  Had already given these documents to Inspector General Horowitz, both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees as well.
[01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:21.195]  But over a dozen FBI agents got into his home, went through it for over six hours, even though, as I said, he'd already given these documents to the proper channels.
[01:48:21.255 --> 01:48:24.737]  He was already acknowledged as a whistleblower by them.
[01:48:25.497 --> 01:48:34.122]  His lawyer said, the bureau raided my client to seize what he legally gave Congress about the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One.
[01:48:35.077 --> 01:48:38.478]  They said it is an outrageous disregard of whistleblower protections.
[01:48:38.678 --> 01:48:42.240]  I'm not sure that there is much in terms of whistleblower protection.
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:44.621]  Yeah, there's laws that are supposed to protect whistleblowers.
[01:48:45.141 --> 01:48:47.222]  You know, there's laws that are supposed to protect us as well.
[01:48:47.502 --> 01:48:51.303]  Things like the Bill of Rights, but it doesn't seem like they are paid much attention to anymore.
[01:48:52.364 --> 01:49:03.048]  President Trump, I think it was two days ago, as the talk was escalating about charges and counter charges and so forth, in the wake of
[01:49:04.505 --> 01:49:05.225]  Cohen talking.
[01:49:05.245 --> 01:49:07.306]  He said, I've got a lot of information I can dump.
[01:49:08.507 --> 01:49:09.667]  Boy, it's really bad.
[01:49:09.907 --> 01:49:13.549]  I don't think I should dump all this because I don't know the American public can handle it.
[01:49:13.649 --> 01:49:14.889]  No, we can handle it, President Trump.
[01:49:15.730 --> 01:49:28.815]  What we can't handle is a government that acts like Stalin or the Stasi or some kind of Kafkaist dystopian police state.
[01:49:29.975 --> 01:49:30.996]  We do not
[01:49:32.028 --> 01:49:34.008]  Need to have everything hidden from the American people.
[01:49:34.048 --> 01:49:37.049]  As a matter of fact, that's the one thing the American people cannot handle.
[01:49:38.409 --> 01:49:43.030]  Because that is destroying the entire credibility of the government.
[01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:45.970]  I don't understand why people, including President Trump, can't see this.
[01:49:46.971 --> 01:49:49.311]  You need to reveal all this information.
[01:49:49.371 --> 01:49:50.311]  Declassify this.
[01:49:50.351 --> 01:49:50.831]  Put this out.
[01:49:50.851 --> 01:49:51.471]  The sooner the better.
[01:49:52.292 --> 01:49:59.073]  He was told that, basically, people said his lawyer advised him that he should hold on to this information for a while.
[01:49:59.193 --> 01:49:59.913]  I don't agree with that.
[01:50:00.976 --> 01:50:04.599]  Maybe that's to his political advantage, and maybe that's the calculus of his lawyer.
[01:50:04.759 --> 01:50:07.761]  You could argue whether that is to his political advantage or not.
[01:50:08.682 --> 01:50:14.106]  But at some point, we're going to start looking at what's in the interest of America.
[01:50:15.547 --> 01:50:24.053]  And to have this deep state being able to operate, commit crimes, never have them exposed, and to intimidate and to harass whistleblowers like this.
[01:50:24.113 --> 01:50:28.597]  As I said, the FBI agents raid the home of a recognized Department of Justice whistleblower.
[01:50:28.617 --> 01:50:30.058]  This is reported by the Daily Caller.
[01:50:30.698 --> 01:50:40.125]  They had the exclusive on this, who privately delivered documents pertaining to the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One to a government watchdog, according to Whistleblower's attorney.
[01:50:40.685 --> 01:50:53.315]  The Justice Department's Inspector General was informed that the documents showed that federal officials failed to investigate potential criminal activity regarding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, and Rosatom.
[01:50:53.935 --> 01:51:01.022]  The Russian company that purchased Uranium One, a document reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation, alleges.
[01:51:01.883 --> 01:51:14.835]  The delivered documents also show that then FBI Director Robert Mueller failed to investigate allegations of criminal misconduct pertaining to Rosatom and to other Russian government entities attached to Uranium One.
[01:51:14.895 --> 01:51:15.556]  We know all this!
[01:51:16.537 --> 01:51:17.518]  But these are the documents.
[01:51:18.322 --> 01:51:20.103]  And now they're harassing this individual.
[01:51:20.163 --> 01:51:21.864]  We know these people were all involved in this.
[01:51:21.884 --> 01:51:23.685]  We know that there was a pay-for-play.
[01:51:23.705 --> 01:51:31.069]  You have Bill Clinton, as this is happening, getting a half-million-dollar speech to the Russians and so forth.
[01:51:31.110 --> 01:51:33.031]  And yet, none of this is investigated.
[01:51:33.271 --> 01:51:39.154]  When you have a whistleblower that comes up with this, then you have him still being harassed by the corrupt Department of Justice and the FBI.
[01:51:40.315 --> 01:51:41.936]  President Trump, we know it's bad.
[01:51:43.513 --> 01:51:48.235]  And it's only going to get worse if we don't shine the light on these cockroaches.
[01:51:48.355 --> 01:51:49.535]  They're just multiplying.
[01:51:49.555 --> 01:51:56.698]  You know, when you don't purge the bad actors out of a system, any system will have bad people in it.
[01:51:57.439 --> 01:52:01.720]  As long as you've got people that make up a system, you're going to have some bad actors in there.
[01:52:02.581 --> 01:52:10.504]  And the question is, as Frank Serpico has said so many times, regardless of what this is, whether it's the police and the local police station,
[01:52:11.408 --> 01:52:23.278]  Whether it's the Department of Justice or the FBI, whatever it is, CIA, if you don't purge out the bad people, if you embrace that, then the entire institution becomes corrupt.
[01:52:24.139 --> 01:52:26.141]  And that's really what has happened with our federal government.
[01:52:26.621 --> 01:52:28.823]  We've also had news before we...
[01:52:30.234 --> 01:52:30.835]  I think so.
[01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:51.576]  For due process, they have no respect for excessive fine protections that are in the Bill of Rights.
[01:52:52.897 --> 01:53:00.522]  It's amazing back and forth in the Supreme Court that came out on Wednesday that's just been reported by the New American.
[01:53:00.562 --> 01:53:08.488]  Most people don't really care that government officials say they can confiscate your car if you're going more than five miles over the speed limit.
[01:53:10.009 --> 01:53:11.230]  Is that an excessive punishment?
[01:53:12.130 --> 01:53:13.891]  Do you get due process, even?
[01:53:14.251 --> 01:53:15.312]  No, they just take your car.
[01:53:15.372 --> 01:53:17.213]  That's what civil asset forfeiture is really about.
[01:53:17.433 --> 01:53:19.414]  So just take all the drug stuff out of the equation.
[01:53:20.415 --> 01:53:22.096]  That's really the principle that's involved here.
[01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:25.498]  Before we get to all that, I just want to tell you about
[01:53:26.901 --> 01:53:27.402]  I think so.
[01:53:43.946 --> 01:53:44.686]  The U.S.
[01:53:44.706 --> 01:53:47.208]  Geological Survey has reported as a 7.0.
[01:53:47.929 --> 01:53:52.052]  It's a big difference because, of course, this is a logarithmic scale.
[01:53:52.433 --> 01:53:59.138]  They have issued a tsunami warning for southern Alaska coastal areas of Cooks Inlet.
[01:54:00.339 --> 01:54:03.762]  And so they're concerned about secondary effects of that.
[01:54:04.462 --> 01:54:08.226]  No other information at this time about that earthquake.
[01:54:09.016 --> 01:54:14.040]  And before we get into other news, I just want to remind you of our Cyber Week specials at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:54:36.759 --> 01:54:38.200]  Again, free shipping store-wide.

[01:54:41.322 --> 01:54:44.945]  You get double Patriot Points, that's our reward system there.
[01:54:44.965 --> 01:54:47.427]  50% off all InfoWars Life Supplements.

[01:54:50.109 --> 01:55:01.195]  And we have big discounts off of our Alexa Pro water filtration system as well as the Alexa Pure Breeze, the air freshener, air filter system for your home.
[01:55:01.835 --> 01:55:04.116]  Very effective, silent air filter.
[01:55:04.136 --> 01:55:05.177]  We use that in our home.
[01:55:05.317 --> 01:55:06.657]  You can now get that 40% off.
[01:55:06.677 --> 01:55:07.898]  That's a big dollar savings.
[01:55:07.958 --> 01:55:12.420]  The discount off of the Pro water filtration system is a $123 discount.
[01:55:14.661 --> 01:55:20.206]  49% off right now and again free shipping storewide as part of our Cyber Week specials.
[01:55:21.968 --> 01:55:37.942]  Let's talk a little bit about this situation with the Supreme Court and the questioning going back and forth between Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and the Indiana Solicitor General.
[01:55:39.144 --> 01:55:43.568]  Now, at the center of this, yes, there is a drug charge.
[01:55:44.388 --> 01:55:51.534]  However, the person's property was confiscated, as is so frequently done, without a conviction.
[01:55:52.375 --> 01:56:05.226]  As a matter of fact, when we look at civil asset forfeiture, not this particular person's case, but civil asset forfeiture in general, in many cases, a charge is never even brought against an individual.
[01:56:06.578 --> 01:56:10.180]  What they do is they bring the charge against the property.
[01:56:11.321 --> 01:56:14.443]  They call this rim jurisdiction.
[01:56:14.683 --> 01:56:21.948]  This is what, when we talk about the back and forth going on between the two lawyers here at the Supreme Court, they talk about rim jurisdiction.
[01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:27.231]  That is defined as something that is against the thing.
[01:56:28.452 --> 01:56:34.656]  So you'll see in these civil asset forfeiture cases, you'll see this legal fiction, the United States government versus $9,000 cash.
[01:56:36.952 --> 01:56:39.633]  As if the $9,000 cash committed a crime.
[01:56:40.553 --> 01:56:40.933]  Or the U.S.
[01:56:40.973 --> 01:56:44.214]  government versus Learjet, serial number blah blah blah.
[01:56:44.254 --> 01:56:45.915]  That was one of the earliest cases that I saw.
[01:56:45.935 --> 01:56:48.415]  It was a guy who had a charter service.
[01:56:49.516 --> 01:56:51.176]  He had a charter plane.
[01:56:51.616 --> 01:56:53.757]  He picked up two executives.
[01:56:54.337 --> 01:56:55.418]  They just had briefcases.
[01:56:55.458 --> 01:56:56.258]  They're wearing suits.
[01:56:56.458 --> 01:56:57.578]  He flew them from the U.S.
[01:56:57.598 --> 01:56:59.799]  to Canada for a business meeting and then he flew them back.
[01:57:00.694 --> 01:57:04.695]  When he landed the plane, he had the DEA surround the plane.
[01:57:04.715 --> 01:57:06.215]  They arrested these two individuals.
[01:57:06.235 --> 01:57:07.475]  And he's like, what's going on?
[01:57:07.495 --> 01:57:11.916]  They said, well, they were talking about a drug deal when they went to Canada.
[01:57:12.516 --> 01:57:13.556]  And we got the evidence on them.
[01:57:13.597 --> 01:57:14.957]  So we're arresting them and charging them.
[01:57:15.097 --> 01:57:16.057]  And we're taking your plane.
[01:57:16.157 --> 01:57:17.197]  He goes, what are you talking about?
[01:57:17.217 --> 01:57:19.358]  He goes, well, we know that you didn't have anything to do with this.
[01:57:20.298 --> 01:57:23.878]  But your plane was involved in the commission of this act.
[01:57:24.859 --> 01:57:25.839]  And so we're going to take your plane.
[01:57:26.707 --> 01:57:28.569]  Now, that was that guy's entire business.
[01:57:28.589 --> 01:57:31.271]  They just confiscated it because of that tangential involvement there.
[01:57:32.172 --> 01:57:33.433]  He had to fight them in court.
[01:57:33.993 --> 01:57:35.314]  He had to sue them in court.
[01:57:36.375 --> 01:57:38.036]  And he had to prove that he was innocent.
[01:57:38.577 --> 01:57:39.478]  And it bankrupted him.
[01:57:40.078 --> 01:57:41.619]  Took him out of business for a couple of years.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:48.085]  But most people don't have the resources to do that because typically they come against poor people doing this type of thing.
[01:57:48.345 --> 01:57:51.988]  But they're destroying all of our rights and we'll give the amazing back and forth when we come back.
[01:57:54.537 --> 01:57:58.985]  We've had the biggest sales in our history because it's end of year.
[01:57:59.386 --> 01:58:02.531]  We want to get all the stock out so it's pay inventory on it.
[01:58:03.795 --> 01:58:08.219]  George Soros has been trying to shut us down, trying to take our banking away, where we can't even process credit cards.
[01:58:08.239 --> 01:58:10.881]  You saw PayPal and others go, but we've got others.
[01:58:11.442 --> 01:58:19.288]  But I'm not going to sit there with a full warehouse of t-shirts, water filters, air filters, high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, really high-quality supplements.
[01:58:19.448 --> 01:58:24.152]  We're moving to sell everything by the end of the year and clear out our warehouse.
[01:58:24.373 --> 01:58:27.195]  And to do that, we're giving the biggest specials ever on everything.
[01:58:27.415 --> 01:58:30.276]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off on the high-quality supplements.
[01:58:30.436 --> 01:58:50.804]  That's X2, X3, Brain Force, Ultimate Bone Broth, Super Mel Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Colloidal Silver, Super Blue Fluoride Free, Iodine and Colloidal Silver Fortified Toothpaste and Mouthwash, Happys, Mood and Body, Knockout, Ultimate Sleep Formula, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Bodies with 95% Humidoids, DNA Force.
[01:58:50.844 --> 01:58:53.065]  What an incredible deal on that flagship product.
[01:58:53.125 --> 01:58:56.066]  Pollen Block, Bio-True Selenium, Vitamin Mineral Fusion,
[01:58:56.186 --> 01:58:57.407]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:58:57.427 --> 01:58:58.948]  We're going to have to end one of these specials.
[01:58:59.048 --> 01:59:06.533]  I may be able to extend this Cyber Monday special to Wednesday or Thursday, but one of the sales that's got to end is the Alexa Pure Pro stainless steel gravity-fed filter for 127.
[01:59:07.254 --> 01:59:12.217]  That is because the folks that make it want to get rid of it all before the end of the year, and they only had a couple thousand.
[01:59:12.297 --> 01:59:16.000]  It's down to less than 500 right now, so that's going to end in the next few days.
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:17.881]  Alexa Pure Pro water filtration.
[01:59:18.041 --> 01:59:18.921]  It's all there.
[01:59:18.941 --> 01:59:19.462]  50% off bare minimum.
[01:59:19.482 --> 01:59:20.142]  Some of it is 75% off.
[01:59:20.162 --> 01:59:21.903]  Double Patriot points on top of free shipping.
[01:59:22.183 --> 01:59:24.484]  Instead of 5 points, what's your next purchase?
[01:59:24.504 --> 01:59:25.184]  10 points.
[01:59:43.391 --> 01:59:45.414]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:45.454 --> 01:59:48.678]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.593 --> 02:00:31.295]  So can the government seize your car for driving 5 miles per hour over the speed limit?
[02:00:31.415 --> 02:00:36.758]  Well, the Indiana Solicitor General told the Supreme Court, yes!
[02:00:38.719 --> 02:00:47.944]  Now, without getting into the specifics of this case, because we've talked many times, I've talked on my program as well as on this program,
[02:00:49.093 --> 02:00:56.475]  About how obscene it is that the federal government would charge inanimate objects with crimes just so they can steal.
[02:00:56.735 --> 02:00:59.996]  Folks, this is nothing other than highway robbery.
[02:01:00.016 --> 02:01:01.176]  In most cases, it's cars.
[02:01:02.676 --> 02:01:11.319]  And in a lot of jurisdictions where they do this, outside of Detroit, for example, most of the cars that they're taking are around $1,000.
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:20.225]  Because even if you come after them, you have to file a $900 fee in order to challenge them.
[02:01:21.045 --> 02:01:22.546]  Because you don't get any due process.
[02:01:23.047 --> 02:01:25.568]  They don't have to prove that you're guilty.
[02:01:25.588 --> 02:01:27.009]  They don't even charge you with a crime.
[02:01:27.049 --> 02:01:28.030]  They just take your stuff.
[02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:31.572]  And then you have to come back and prove that your stuff didn't do anything.
[02:01:32.393 --> 02:01:37.216]  This is the insanity that they've created for us when they put charges against the thing.
[02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:40.198]  That's what they call this REM jurisdiction.
[02:01:41.199 --> 02:01:42.720]  The idea that the property
[02:01:43.573 --> 02:01:48.476]  Is the primary object of the action rather than the person that owns the property.
[02:01:50.257 --> 02:01:53.079]  This is just absolute insanity.
[02:01:53.119 --> 02:01:55.140]  It's like something out of a Kafka novel.
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:58.262]  And yet this is the way our government operates right now.
[02:01:59.222 --> 02:02:12.290]  A century and a half ago we had Lysander Spooner say the difference between the government and a highway robber is that a highway robber just steals your purse and then leaves you alone.
[02:02:13.137 --> 02:02:16.078]  The government steals your purse and follows you down the road, nagging you.
[02:02:16.699 --> 02:02:22.221]  Well, no, they take everything now, and they still nag you.
[02:02:22.281 --> 02:02:29.465]  Things really haven't changed, but the highway robbery has gotten much, much worse because it has become a very, very lucrative business.
[02:02:30.305 --> 02:02:35.248]  And Lysander Spooner's day, they didn't have anything like civil asset forfeiture.
[02:02:35.528 --> 02:02:39.650]  What he was talking about was more of a metaphor, but it has quite literally become true.
[02:02:40.245 --> 02:02:43.206]  The government has quite literally become highway robbers.
[02:02:44.166 --> 02:02:48.987]  And so, in this particular case, it is not a cheap car.
[02:02:49.607 --> 02:02:59.030]  It was a $42,000 Land Rover that was purchased with money that this individual inherited.
[02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:01.290]  He had a drug problem.
[02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:06.012]  He also purchased drugs with the money that he inherited.
[02:03:07.771 --> 02:03:12.775]  And he also sold some drugs to some undercover officers.
[02:03:12.855 --> 02:03:20.042]  He sold $500 worth of drugs, and so they confiscated his $42,000 Land Rover.
[02:03:21.223 --> 02:03:32.573]  Now, a lot of you, if you think that the war on drugs is going to save people from addiction, in spite of 47 years of experience to the contrary, you would say, well, he violated the law.
[02:03:32.633 --> 02:03:33.473]  He was selling drugs.
[02:03:33.513 --> 02:03:34.955]  So, yeah, penalize him.
[02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:39.550]  Well, the problem is that he wasn't convicted of anything at the time they took his property.
[02:03:40.951 --> 02:03:44.432]  And there's also an issue of excessive punishment.
[02:03:44.532 --> 02:03:50.854]  But if we talk about excessive punishment, and that's really where Justice Breyer was going, here's how the dialogue kind of unfolded here.
[02:03:50.874 --> 02:03:52.954]  I'll read you just a little bit of what he had to say.
[02:03:53.094 --> 02:04:02.017]  He asks Mr. Fisher, who is the representative, let's see, he is a Solicitor General, that's his title, for Indiana, the state of Indiana.
[02:04:03.158 --> 02:04:14.794]  Justice Breyer says, so what is to happen if a state that needs revenue says that anyone who speeds has to forfeit the Bugatti, the Mercedes, or the special Ferrari, or even a jalopy?
[02:04:16.121 --> 02:04:24.045]  And Mr. Fisher comes back and says, well, I think it's important to remember that there is a constitutional limit, which is the proof of instrumentality.
[02:04:24.706 --> 02:04:27.527]  Now, there is nothing like that in the Constitution.
[02:04:28.047 --> 02:04:32.370]  This is something that has been invented, just like this Rim Jurisdiction that he's going to be talking about, folks.
[02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:48.880]  This is just pure legal BS, pretending that they have some kind of a law or a system that they're following, so that they can undermine the clear statement of protection of our rights that's outlined in the Constitution.
[02:04:50.561 --> 02:04:51.742]  It is a legal fiction.
[02:04:51.882 --> 02:04:52.602]  It is maneuvering.
[02:04:53.203 --> 02:04:55.304]  And basically, Justice Breyer calls him on it.
[02:04:55.324 --> 02:04:56.445]  I'll have the rest of this when we come back.
[02:04:56.465 --> 02:04:56.805]  Stay with us.
[02:05:05.908 --> 02:05:07.249]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:07.269 --> 02:05:16.912]  Before we head back into some more news stories, I want to tell you about the great specials available at InfoWarsStore.com right now, where we have the Cyber Week special running.

[02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:51.846]  We've also got up to 75% off storewide plus free shipping and double Patriot points available right now as part of the Cyber Week special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:51.926 --> 02:05:52.686]  Please go there.
[02:05:52.846 --> 02:05:53.807]  Please support us.
[02:05:53.967 --> 02:06:01.630]  They're trying to undermine us, financially sabotage us at every available opportunity, so we rely on your support more than ever at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:28.553 --> 02:06:30.394]  So folks, do you really own anything?
[02:06:31.274 --> 02:06:32.955]  Do you really have any rights?
[02:06:34.536 --> 02:06:41.079]  There's a back and forth between Justice Breyer and the Solicitor General for Indiana, Mr. Fisher.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.801]  They're arguing a civil assets forfeiture case.
[02:06:45.556 --> 02:06:52.664]  And in the questioning, Justice Breyer led him down the path and got him to admit that yes, he would confiscate your car.
[02:06:53.164 --> 02:07:05.897]  No matter the value, if it was a jalopy or if it was a Bugatti, that maybe cost a million dollars, they would confiscate your car if you're going, they would have the right to confiscate it if you're going more than five miles over the speed limit, for example.
[02:07:05.917 --> 02:07:07.459]  Because you violated the law.
[02:07:09.533 --> 02:07:12.194]  We don't have to find you guilty of anything.
[02:07:12.254 --> 02:07:15.076]  It was the car that was violating the law.
[02:07:15.096 --> 02:07:17.397]  That car was going five miles over the speed limit.
[02:07:20.438 --> 02:07:22.179]  This is where we're headed folks.
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:25.841]  We have no rights and you own nothing.
[02:07:26.581 --> 02:07:28.002]  You are nothing but a slave.
[02:07:28.022 --> 02:07:28.942]  You're their property.
[02:07:29.362 --> 02:07:30.303]  You're their livestock.
[02:07:31.348 --> 02:07:34.669]  And so as he's questioning him, he goes, so you could take it for speeding, right?
[02:07:34.689 --> 02:07:39.230]  He goes, well, I think it's important to remember that there is a constitutional limit, says the lawyer from Indiana.
[02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:42.731]  He says, which is the proof of instrumentality?
[02:07:42.811 --> 02:07:47.332]  And Justice Breyer says, well, that isn't a problem because the Bugatti that he was in was speeding.
[02:07:47.812 --> 02:07:48.932]  And he goes, yeah, right.
[02:07:49.012 --> 02:07:52.073]  And he goes, so there's your nexus right there for your instrumentality.
[02:07:52.093 --> 02:07:56.834]  And he goes, well, historically, he goes, now I just wonder, what is it?
[02:07:56.954 --> 02:07:59.555]  Is that permissible under the Constitution?
[02:08:00.988 --> 02:08:05.771]  And the Solicitor General from Indiana says, uh, to forfeit the Bugatti for speeding?
[02:08:06.471 --> 02:08:07.592]  And Justice Breyer says, yeah.
[02:08:07.972 --> 02:08:12.575]  And by the way, it was only five miles an hour over the speed limit.
[02:08:13.896 --> 02:08:17.177]  And then the Inspector General for Indiana says, yeah.
[02:08:19.919 --> 02:08:25.782]  And he says, well, you know, the answer is yes, and I would call your attention to... Justice Breyer says, is it yes?
[02:08:27.003 --> 02:08:29.545]  And Mr. Fisher says, yes, it is forfeitable.
[02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:32.571]  Justice Breyer says, it's forfeitable?
[02:08:32.591 --> 02:08:35.352]  And Fisher from Indiana says, yeah.
[02:08:35.952 --> 02:08:37.372]  The Louisa Barber case.
[02:08:37.672 --> 02:08:42.294]  One person over the passenger limit and the entire ship is forfeit.
[02:08:42.954 --> 02:08:43.634]  This is history.
[02:08:44.035 --> 02:08:47.336]  History shows us this in rim forfeiture.
[02:08:48.556 --> 02:08:50.917]  And Justice Breyer says, so if the airplane is speeding,
[02:08:51.772 --> 02:08:59.719]  And Mr. Fisher from Indiana says, well, and rim forfeitures have always been with us, and they have always been harsh.
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:01.080]  Harsh.
[02:09:02.462 --> 02:09:04.343]  They have always been excessive.
[02:09:05.084 --> 02:09:11.470]  And so he goes back and he quotes a case where evidently somebody lost their entire ship because they had one person over the passenger limit.
[02:09:12.912 --> 02:09:17.435]  You know, I kind of came close to experiencing this after I graduated from high school.
[02:09:17.455 --> 02:09:22.417]  A bunch of my friends and I went down to the John Pennekamp State Park down in the Keys.
[02:09:22.437 --> 02:09:24.939]  We were going to go snorkeling and scuba diving.
[02:09:26.119 --> 02:09:27.280]  I had some scuba equipment.
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.641]  Some of the other guys were going to go snorkeling.
[02:09:29.521 --> 02:09:31.602]  We rented, we kind of broke up.
[02:09:31.622 --> 02:09:37.546]  We were doing different things and a couple guys went to rent the boat and they met the rest of us.
[02:09:39.017 --> 02:09:43.000]  And I forget how many of us there was, but it wasn't that excessive.
[02:09:43.341 --> 02:09:46.263]  We had one person more than we had a life jacket.
[02:09:46.343 --> 02:09:54.209]  We got stopped by a park official, I guess, because it was an underwater state park.
[02:09:54.369 --> 02:09:56.171]  He wanted to know how many life jackets we had.
[02:09:56.231 --> 02:10:00.614]  We had enough life jackets if you counted my buoyancy compensator, but he didn't want to count that.
[02:10:01.375 --> 02:10:03.156]  It wasn't an official life jacket.
[02:10:04.157 --> 02:10:06.959]  And so what they did was they officially confiscated
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:09.560]  Our rental.
[02:10:10.721 --> 02:10:13.222]  We didn't own the boat, but they made us take it back.
[02:10:14.262 --> 02:10:21.325]  And he said, well, you got to return this and tell these guys to go back and get another life jacket or whatever.
[02:10:21.345 --> 02:10:25.567]  He knew that they weren't going to let the guys take it back out again.
[02:10:25.867 --> 02:10:29.348]  And so a couple of us didn't want to take the trip back.
[02:10:29.408 --> 02:10:31.749]  So we hopped overboard and we swam over to an island.
[02:10:31.789 --> 02:10:33.890]  We waited for the other guys to come back and pick us up.
[02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:36.011]  And they didn't come and they didn't come.
[02:10:36.051 --> 02:10:36.611]  And finally, the
[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:40.842]  A law enforcement officer came back.
[02:10:40.882 --> 02:10:41.903]  He was very upset with us.
[02:10:42.903 --> 02:10:50.029]  He had put my friend who had rented this thing in jail and had come back and picked us up.
[02:10:50.049 --> 02:10:52.591]  And he said, I knew they weren't going to let you take this thing back out again.
[02:10:52.811 --> 02:10:58.416]  Basically, they confiscated our money because we'd spent all of our money in renting that boat for the day.
[02:10:58.436 --> 02:11:00.037]  We just had graduated high school.
[02:11:00.057 --> 02:11:00.918]  We didn't have that much money.
[02:11:02.276 --> 02:11:04.817]  And he said, I knew they weren't going to let you guys take this back out again.
[02:11:05.937 --> 02:11:07.617]  But you know, we were one person over the limit.
[02:11:07.657 --> 02:11:11.858]  So evidently there was a case where they confiscated an entire ship.
[02:11:12.238 --> 02:11:12.779]  Forfeited it.
[02:11:13.619 --> 02:11:15.659]  Because that ship had committed a crime.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.420]  This is the kind of insanity that we're letting them get away with.
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:21.641]  It isn't going to stop there.
[02:11:21.801 --> 02:11:22.901]  I mean, here's some more insanity.
[02:11:22.921 --> 02:11:28.222]  You don't think that a 163% meat tax could be coming?
[02:11:28.702 --> 02:11:31.143]  This is a story coming out of DC Clothesline and others.
[02:11:32.379 --> 02:11:32.960]  Talking about this.
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:33.921]  Think about this, folks.
[02:11:34.542 --> 02:11:45.534]  If you get a $5 hamburger, and they put 163% tax on it, which is what's been proposed by a study coming out of the University of Oxford.
[02:11:46.892 --> 02:11:50.473]  So you have a $5 hamburger, they put a 163% tax on it.
[02:11:51.414 --> 02:11:54.455]  That means for that $5 hamburger you got an $8.15 tax.
[02:11:54.475 --> 02:12:00.797]  And so your total hamburger then goes from $5 to $13.15.
[02:12:01.558 --> 02:12:08.660]  And as they point out in the DC clothesline, you think this isn't going to happen?
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:13.222]  Remember when smoking was the only socially engineered target?
[02:12:14.381 --> 02:12:19.865]  Then they came after fat, then they came after sugar, then caffeine, then soda, now they're coming after meat.
[02:12:20.105 --> 02:12:27.370]  You know when this came out and they started coming after cigarettes really hard back in the late 80s?
[02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:36.537]  And I was working with libertarians and we started telling people, you know they're going to come through your kitchen and they're going to tell you you can't have sugar.
[02:12:37.378 --> 02:12:37.878]  And things like that.
[02:12:37.898 --> 02:12:38.938]  They're going to put a tax on that.
[02:12:38.978 --> 02:12:41.599]  People will say, oh, come on, you stupid conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:41.819 --> 02:12:42.959]  You're taking this to the extreme.
[02:12:43.239 --> 02:12:45.980]  Nobody is ever going to tell you you can't have sugar.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.740]  Well, we've seen how that works in New York and elsewhere.
[02:12:52.521 --> 02:13:00.762]  So they've decided that, according to these people at the University of Oxford, they actually came up with optimal tax rates for things.
[02:13:01.642 --> 02:13:04.303]  You know, for red meat, maybe they'll only give you a 34% tax.
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:17.652]  If it's a processed meat, you know, things like sausage and bacon and salami, things like that, they propose, for the United States at least, to tax people 163%.
[02:13:17.932 --> 02:13:23.358]  And then they come out and say, well, that could save 52,500 American lives per year.
[02:13:28.699 --> 02:13:38.886]  The same way that by taking away your cars and making you all ride in electric golf carts that are tracked and taxed every inch by the federal government, they're going to save 50,000 lives a year there as well.
[02:13:39.046 --> 02:13:42.948]  It's always, you know, 50,000 lives they're going to save everywhere.
[02:13:43.869 --> 02:13:46.170]  But of course it only costs you all of your freedom.
[02:13:47.991 --> 02:13:49.292]  This is the way they justify this.
[02:13:49.412 --> 02:13:55.156]  But if they can take any property of yours, again, without ever even charging you with a crime,
[02:13:55.732 --> 02:14:02.234]  If they can take a million dollar car, that was the case that the Supreme Court Justice offered to the Solicitor General of Indiana.
[02:14:03.914 --> 02:14:08.255]  Said, you know, so somebody's got a million dollar car and he's driving five miles per hour over the speed limit.
[02:14:08.315 --> 02:14:09.676]  The guy says, yeah, that'd be okay.
[02:14:10.316 --> 02:14:14.217]  Yeah, we can take airplanes, we can take ships, we can take anything, because they commit crimes.
[02:14:15.577 --> 02:14:21.439]  And they call it civil, folks, because it is a rule, not a law.
[02:14:22.338 --> 02:14:26.379]  It is a rule that was passed by bureaucrats that are not elected by you.
[02:14:27.479 --> 02:14:29.820]  So it's kind of a taxation without representation.
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:31.520]  It's also a regulation without representation.
[02:14:33.001 --> 02:14:40.483]  And by saying that it is a regulation and saying that it is civil, you don't have a presumption of innocence.
[02:14:40.543 --> 02:14:46.965]  Just like they use that same kind of maneuvering to say that the IRS doesn't have to give you due process.
[02:14:47.985 --> 02:14:51.146]  The IRS can say, we assess you this amount of tax
[02:14:52.165 --> 02:14:54.446]  And you're going to have to sue us in court and prove that you're innocent.
[02:14:54.506 --> 02:14:56.827]  Now, you know, it was outrageous when the IRS did that.
[02:14:56.887 --> 02:15:02.330]  Now we've got all the government bureaucracies doing that and assessing any level of penalty that they wish.
[02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:10.253]  Remember when the FAA said we're going to charge people a $25,000 fine if they don't register their little micro drones with us.
[02:15:11.714 --> 02:15:15.396]  Now they eventually backed down from that as people pushed back against it.
[02:15:15.436 --> 02:15:19.878]  But again, these people can make any kind of mandate or dictate that they wish.
[02:15:19.918 --> 02:15:21.799]  These unelected bureaucrats in Washington
[02:15:22.793 --> 02:15:24.494]  They can then enforce that against people?
[02:15:26.275 --> 02:15:27.916]  And you don't have the presumption of innocence?
[02:15:27.936 --> 02:15:29.997]  You don't have protection against excessive fines?
[02:15:31.398 --> 02:15:34.139]  I don't know if this is going to stand in the Supreme Court or not.
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:36.221]  Why are we standing for this?
[02:15:37.021 --> 02:15:37.942]  I really don't understand.
[02:15:38.002 --> 02:15:39.462]  How much longer is this going to go on?
[02:15:39.522 --> 02:15:41.263]  It's been going on for decades.
[02:15:41.604 --> 02:15:44.525]  This was enacted in the Reagan administration.
[02:15:44.545 --> 02:15:47.527]  And a lot of people have talked about this in a lot of different areas.
[02:15:47.547 --> 02:15:49.128]  Of course, Jeff Sessions is all for it.
[02:15:50.389 --> 02:15:53.772]  Thankfully he's gone now, but President Trump needs to wake up.
[02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.433]  Actually, the American people need to wake up.
[02:15:55.733 --> 02:15:57.034]  He's coming against us.
[02:15:58.054 --> 02:15:58.915]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:16:03.104 --> 02:16:05.245]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[02:16:05.325 --> 02:16:11.067]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[02:16:11.187 --> 02:16:13.608]  Thank you for telling me that.
[02:16:13.748 --> 02:16:15.729]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[02:16:16.329 --> 02:16:18.630]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:19.971]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[02:16:19.991 --> 02:16:21.291]  But do you think that you demonized it?
[02:16:21.311 --> 02:16:24.973]  Jim Acosta told the President that the caravan didn't exist.
[02:16:26.363 --> 02:16:31.667]  And then, of course, they also said that it didn't exist when he pulled the microphone away and pushed the intern's arm down.
[02:16:32.588 --> 02:16:35.110]  But, of course, the caravan does exist.
[02:16:35.130 --> 02:16:38.032]  There's more than 50,000 people still making their way up.
[02:16:38.452 --> 02:16:43.096]  More than 10,000, as of today, are already massing on the border.
[02:16:43.617 --> 02:16:52.203]  And I have the camera crew and reporters there on the ground sending back incredible live feeds and also reports.
[02:16:53.244 --> 02:16:54.225]  But just think about that.
[02:16:54.972 --> 02:17:04.901]  Remember when the PR operative for Obama, Jonathan Gruber, bragged, thank God Americans are so stupid, thank God you have no attention span?
[02:17:05.301 --> 02:17:09.465]  You know, it's not just Jim Acosta that said that there is no caravan.
[02:17:09.746 --> 02:17:16.211]  At first they said, oh, the caravans are all women and children, they're all so sweet, and then they smash over the Guatemala border into Mexico, and okay, well,
[02:17:17.116 --> 02:17:17.997]  They deserve to be here.
[02:17:18.297 --> 02:17:19.898]  And then, oh, they're not violent.
[02:17:19.938 --> 02:17:21.380]  And then, oh, it doesn't exist.
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:22.020]  You're crazy.
[02:17:22.641 --> 02:17:24.262]  It's something Trump made up for the election.
[02:17:24.762 --> 02:17:32.609]  And now when Trump says, OK, we've beefed up security there, well, now he's a horrible, evil racist for not letting these people in.
[02:17:32.729 --> 02:17:35.291]  And less than 10% are women and children.
[02:17:35.912 --> 02:17:45.140]  And we catch the media cropping photos in a staged event with a woman with two kids with no shoes that just supposedly came up thousands of miles from Central and South America.
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:47.841]  And the lies go on and on from there.
[02:17:48.081 --> 02:17:53.284]  And that's why Infowars.com and Newswars.com existing is so critical.
[02:17:53.905 --> 02:18:04.350]  Because the only way for these insane lies to work, saying that there are more than two genders, saying that mother and father is bad, saying that world government doesn't exist while they're promoting it.
[02:18:04.810 --> 02:18:05.651]  All the things they're doing.
[02:18:06.351 --> 02:18:08.953]  Saying the surveillance state's a great thing, but also saying it doesn't exist.
[02:18:09.433 --> 02:18:09.973]  All this 1984 garbage.
[02:18:12.278 --> 02:18:29.117]  I can't stand being challenged at all, and that's why all over the world a reign of censorship is coming in, in a perfect storm of dying corporate media, big megacorporations, authoritarian regimes like Communist China, the EU, the Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:39.563]  Loyal Americans and other loyal nationalists and just people that want free market and success and know that the American system, while not perfect, has been the best the world ever saw.
[02:18:39.944 --> 02:18:49.107]  And we don't want to adopt this crony capitalist model like Communist China has done, where the heads of the party are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and the general public starving to death.
[02:18:49.947 --> 02:18:51.830]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:53.353]  This is sick.
[02:18:53.753 --> 02:18:56.357]  This is an attack on common sense, an attack on logic.
[02:18:56.838 --> 02:18:58.961]  And that's why InfoWars is more important than ever.
[02:18:59.663 --> 02:19:01.946]  We've got live feeds every day with our reporters.
[02:19:02.327 --> 02:19:04.550]  It's amazing at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:19:05.211 --> 02:19:13.395]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas and this holiday season, all of you remember that without you supporting InfoWars financially, we will be shut down.
[02:19:13.835 --> 02:19:15.076]  And we make it easy to do.
[02:19:15.456 --> 02:19:16.596]  We've got amazing products.
[02:19:16.636 --> 02:19:24.400]  We've got Cyber Week going right now, extending our big mega sales for Black Friday, while supplies last, water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements.
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:30.322]  T-shirts, books, films, it's all there, and it makes the information war possible against the globalists.
[02:19:30.342 --> 02:19:34.723]  So, I want to thank you this Christmas for your support, and I want to ask you for your continued support.
[02:19:35.103 --> 02:19:38.845]  It's a 360 win because these products are great, and these sales are the biggest ever.
[02:19:39.085 --> 02:19:43.766]  Free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off across the board, and double Patriot points.
[02:19:44.186 --> 02:19:47.507]  Right now, at InfoWarsTore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:19:49.548 --> 02:20:02.694]  But whatever you do, take action today and spread the word and spread the live info or links and articles past the censors because when you take action, nothing on earth can stop you.
[02:20:06.335 --> 02:20:08.956]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.967 --> 02:20:20.448]  News.
[02:20:21.008 --> 02:20:21.849]  Analysis.
[02:20:22.349 --> 02:20:23.010]  Reports.
[02:20:23.791 --> 02:20:25.933]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:26.693 --> 02:20:29.556]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[02:20:37.223 --> 02:20:37.763]  Welcome back.
[02:20:38.024 --> 02:20:41.207]  You know, we've had an earthquake just outside of Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:20:42.370 --> 02:20:46.612]  It's been reported anywhere from 6.6, 6.7, I think is what AP reported.
[02:20:46.632 --> 02:20:47.612]  The U.S.
[02:20:47.632 --> 02:20:53.614]  Geological Service reported it as a 7.0, put out a tsunami warning.
[02:20:54.735 --> 02:20:58.236]  Not really sure which report is more accurate or up-to-date.
[02:20:58.336 --> 02:21:02.617]  Nevertheless, it's a fairly large earthquake at that size.
[02:21:04.018 --> 02:21:06.779]  And it comes as there was an interesting
[02:21:07.927 --> 02:21:19.854]  This article is up on the Drudge Report, picked up by several sources, about a worldwide tremor that moved an island a couple of inches in one direction and a couple of inches in another direction.
[02:21:21.495 --> 02:21:25.178]  And the strange thing about this tremor, it wasn't noticed by most people.
[02:21:25.198 --> 02:21:32.903]  It was a small island between Madagascar and Mozambique on November the 11th.
[02:21:34.555 --> 02:21:41.199]  That had the movement that said it slid 2.4 inches to the east and 1.2 inches to the south.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:44.681]  This report from November 12th from the French government.
[02:21:45.161 --> 02:21:49.244]  This small island of Mayotte, I guess is the way to pronounce this.
[02:21:49.824 --> 02:21:55.588]  But the strange thing was, as National Geographic says, it was strange for a number of reasons.
[02:21:56.708 --> 02:21:59.110]  Not only did this small tremor move it,
[02:22:00.031 --> 02:22:02.732]  But it was also the nature of the tremor.
[02:22:03.513 --> 02:22:08.515]  They said first it rang at just a single ultra-low frequency, like a well-tuned bell.
[02:22:09.416 --> 02:22:17.780]  Seismic waves, when you typically have an earthquake or something like we just had today in Anchorage, Alaska, usually involve a lot of different frequencies.
[02:22:19.441 --> 02:22:21.242]  And we've seen this type of thing before.
[02:22:21.302 --> 02:22:27.445]  Secondly, they said the wave emerged and circled the entire planet without the usual signs of an earthquake.
[02:22:28.530 --> 02:22:29.450]  So very, very strange.
[02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:34.832]  And again, it appeared because it only had a single ultra-low frequency.
[02:22:34.852 --> 02:22:39.953]  They say, well, it looks like perhaps it is man-made, something like that.
[02:22:39.973 --> 02:22:41.074]  We've seen this in the past.
[02:22:41.134 --> 02:22:49.856]  Again, you know, remember when we had those earthquakes, I think it was, was it 2011, I think?
[02:22:49.956 --> 02:22:53.557]  I think it was before I came here to InfoWars, just before I came here.
[02:22:53.597 --> 02:22:56.178]  We had the East Coast earthquake.
[02:22:57.349 --> 02:23:01.670]  That was really strange, just outside of Washington, D.C., and it went up the East Coast.
[02:23:02.871 --> 02:23:04.331]  And it was strange for a number of reasons.
[02:23:04.391 --> 02:23:05.952]  It was strange because of the depth.
[02:23:06.732 --> 02:23:14.874]  It was only about a 5.0 on the Richter scale, which was about the amount that you usually see for an underground explosion.
[02:23:17.055 --> 02:23:25.898]  And then, it was like a week or two weeks later, I'm just going from memory now, I can't remember exactly, there was another one in Colorado.
[02:23:26.738 --> 02:23:27.879]  Not too far from Denver.
[02:23:29.179 --> 02:23:30.680]  Another underground earthquake.
[02:23:31.981 --> 02:23:33.121]  About the same magnitude.
[02:23:33.822 --> 02:23:36.643]  And it also had the same seismic envelope.
[02:23:37.543 --> 02:23:39.504]  And it was different from a natural earthquake.
[02:23:39.524 --> 02:23:41.045]  Now this particular one was unusual.
[02:23:41.085 --> 02:23:46.948]  I've never heard of this before, where you have just a single ultra-low frequency instead of a broad spectrum like you would have with a natural event.
[02:23:47.548 --> 02:23:52.351]  The other thing about a natural event, other than the frequencies present, is the envelope.
[02:23:53.619 --> 02:23:59.162]  Typically, with an underground explosion like a nuclear detonation, you see an impulse.
[02:24:00.502 --> 02:24:05.665]  Whereas with a natural earthquake, you see a gradual ramping up.
[02:24:05.725 --> 02:24:09.326]  You see a sustained build-up and then it comes down.
[02:24:09.346 --> 02:24:14.168]  It isn't just an immediate impulse if you look at the waveform.
[02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:19.591]  Now what we saw with those earthquakes that happened in Washington and in D.C.
[02:24:21.458 --> 02:24:25.522]  Uh, were spikes that looked like a man-made situation.
[02:24:25.562 --> 02:24:29.645]  The magnitude of it was about what you would expect from an underground nuclear explosion as well.
[02:24:30.286 --> 02:24:40.033]  It did not have that envelope, but this is another unusual thing that I don't think anybody that is reporting on this says that they have seen before.
[02:24:41.561 --> 02:24:43.061]  You know, we look at this type of thing.
[02:24:43.081 --> 02:24:50.343]  It was a couple of weeks ago I was talking to Richard Sachs of Lost Arts Radio about the fires out in California.
[02:24:50.363 --> 02:24:57.725]  A lot of people have pointed out the possible connections and involvement of geoengineering in that.
[02:24:59.486 --> 02:25:01.326]  Certainly, President Trump was right.
[02:25:01.426 --> 02:25:02.587]  I've talked about this for years.
[02:25:02.987 --> 02:25:05.948]  My uncle was a forestry professor.
[02:25:05.988 --> 02:25:10.729]  He talked about the changes in forestry management
[02:25:11.684 --> 02:25:19.267]  The philosophy that had changed with government management not removing any dead wood out of the forest, whether it's standing or fallen.
[02:25:19.987 --> 02:25:26.690]  The accumulation of firewood that causes any kind of fire to basically be out of control.
[02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:29.491]  When I went to Oregon,
[02:25:31.252 --> 02:25:47.120]  I talked to, in the aftermath of the death of Lavoie Finnegan, we were talking to people in that area that they were talking to about land management issues and the mismanagement of the federal government over lands that they claim ownership of.
[02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:49.101]  Of course, they don't have ownership under the Constitution.
[02:25:50.162 --> 02:25:54.564]  But they claim ownership of it, and they're supposed to be managing it, but they are mismanaging it.
[02:25:55.845 --> 02:25:59.467]  And I talked to a lumberjack who's
[02:26:01.195 --> 02:26:05.856]  Life savings was invested in land that he had picked out, timberland.
[02:26:06.716 --> 02:26:12.537]  The mismanagement of the public lands, if you want to call them that, had spilled over and destroyed everything that he had.
[02:26:13.557 --> 02:26:20.158]  And he was talking about how intense the fires build because of all this stored fuel there.
[02:26:20.178 --> 02:26:25.959]  So President Trump is right, and they are contributing with their policies to these fires.
[02:26:25.979 --> 02:26:28.380]  We've seen that same type of thing happen here in Texas.
[02:26:29.167 --> 02:26:38.192]  But we've also seen droughts, and of course that is a big contributing factor, and there's also chemicals that are on the ground because there's a lot of geoengineering that is already happening.
[02:26:38.253 --> 02:26:41.735]  Just in the last week or so, we have seen reports
[02:26:42.953 --> 02:26:47.454]  And I talked about this as well at the beginning of this week, how they're now normalizing the idea.
[02:26:47.474 --> 02:26:52.835]  They used to pour, let's say, cold water on the idea of chemtrails.
[02:26:53.075 --> 02:26:54.315]  Oh, nobody's doing any of that.
[02:26:54.375 --> 02:26:58.536]  Even though we had videos, we had whistleblowers talking about how that was their mission.
[02:26:58.596 --> 02:27:08.238]  We had videos showing specially designed nozzles on special planes that were putting out very heavy, persistent contrails, if you will.
[02:27:08.478 --> 02:27:10.419]  Something very different than the usual contrails.
[02:27:11.688 --> 02:27:17.411]  But of course they would deny that even as they were having geoengineering conferences where they say who's going to set the thermostat?
[02:27:17.451 --> 02:27:18.112]  How do we decide?
[02:27:18.152 --> 02:27:25.595]  I mean, you know, some people, you know, Russia would like to have the world warmer, whereas people that are near the equator, they would like to see a cooler.
[02:27:25.695 --> 02:27:27.356]  So who's going to get to set the thermostat?
[02:27:28.577 --> 02:27:30.238]  And now they're openly talking about this.
[02:27:30.578 --> 02:27:34.080]  They had, in this month, they had a new study published in Environmental Research Letters.
[02:27:35.219 --> 02:27:39.220]  Talks about how they could do it, as if they aren't already doing it.
[02:27:39.781 --> 02:27:42.501]  We reported for years that they already are doing this.
[02:27:43.302 --> 02:27:44.722]  Creating droughts in certain areas.
[02:27:45.642 --> 02:27:47.923]  We had the Skyder Alert program.
[02:27:48.043 --> 02:27:50.904]  It was an app that you could get on your phone.
[02:27:51.745 --> 02:27:55.886]  You could take a picture when you saw cross-hatching contrails that were persistent.
[02:27:57.096 --> 02:27:59.418]  They took a picture of it and it sends your location to these people.
[02:27:59.458 --> 02:28:02.320]  They started doing crowdsourcing research on this.
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:10.346]  They found that where they would see these cross-hatching patterns of persistent contrails, that they would see a rise in the temperature there.
[02:28:11.106 --> 02:28:14.809]  So yeah, they can use this to increase the temperature, to manipulate the temperature.
[02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:16.731]  Now they're saying, you know, we've got an idea.
[02:28:17.451 --> 02:28:23.796]  We could put up a fleet of 100 planes and make 4,000 worldwide missions per year to save the world from climate change.
[02:28:25.031 --> 02:28:28.573]  Now China has already been bragging about the fact that they're doing this.
[02:28:29.393 --> 02:28:37.518]  As a matter of fact, they're bragging about how they used it to modify the weather for the Beijing Olympics.
[02:28:38.868 --> 02:29:00.659]  But while they're doing all this and denying that they're doing any climate modification, that they're doing any geoengineering, that they are creating conditions that lead to drought, that they are putting down chemicals that are accelerants and pollutants into our environment, they are out there virtue signaling and saying, you know, climate change is going to
[02:29:02.861 --> 02:29:07.789]  What is the one event that made this whole thing news?
[02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:14.861]  When it's been going on for years and years and years and was never news, was never reported, what was it?
[02:29:16.118 --> 02:29:17.359]  That made it news now.
[02:29:18.359 --> 02:29:23.601]  Well, first and foremost was the desire for the media to make it a story.
[02:29:23.841 --> 02:29:27.543]  There is no reporting the news or discovering it.
[02:29:27.663 --> 02:29:28.744]  There is making the news.
[02:29:29.084 --> 02:29:31.665]  That's why I call this a manufactured crisis.
[02:29:32.225 --> 02:29:35.987]  And Boorstin's theory is that it usually happens with an image.
[02:29:37.027 --> 02:29:42.170]  A still photograph or a video that somebody in the media trots out
[02:29:43.277 --> 02:29:50.881]  And uses the image to begin shaping the emotional reaction of consumers of news.
[02:29:51.201 --> 02:29:56.144]  I could sit here all day and tell you about President Trump's new zero-tolerance immigration policy.
[02:29:56.184 --> 02:29:59.146]  The one that's leading to the separation of children from their parents at the border.
[02:29:59.186 --> 02:30:03.008]  And I could help you understand it by maybe quoting numbers or statistics.
[02:30:03.068 --> 02:30:05.069]  I could play sound bites of officials.
[02:30:05.809 --> 02:30:08.070]  Or I could just show you a single picture.
[02:30:08.551 --> 02:30:08.971]  This one.
[02:30:09.591 --> 02:30:18.720]  Of a screaming, terrified, two-year-old little girl wearing a tiny pink jacket, no laces in her shoes, stopped at the U.S.
[02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:19.800]  border with her mother.
[02:30:20.461 --> 02:30:27.648]  She is quickly becoming the human face of Trump's new immigration policy, one he says he hates, but is refusing to change.
[02:30:37.163 --> 02:30:38.965]  How soon do you think we'll be able to get this cut?
[02:30:39.385 --> 02:30:41.086]  Oh, we're gonna be done in about four or five hours.
[02:30:41.867 --> 02:30:42.988]  Oh, that's good.
[02:30:43.008 --> 02:30:43.929]  We can link that to the press.
[02:30:43.949 --> 02:30:46.211]  They can downlink it on Telstar 401, transporter 21.
[02:30:46.311 --> 02:30:52.416]  In this just in, a news break special report from the Albanian front.
[02:30:52.576 --> 02:31:00.062]  We've just received information that the young Albanian national fleeing in this video is attempting to escape terrorist reprisals in her village.
[02:31:06.011 --> 02:31:11.553]  America has seldom witnessed a more poignant picture of the human race than that which our... Fantastic.
[02:31:12.313 --> 02:31:17.035]  Thousands of people protested across Texas yesterday.
[02:31:17.095 --> 02:31:22.277]  They accused the administration of punishing undocumented children by removing them from their parents.
[02:31:22.717 --> 02:31:29.100]  Children and adults are seen huddled together in the building that's divided up into chain-link fencing that looks like a cage.
[02:31:29.140 --> 02:31:33.622]  Trump administration officials have been sending babies and other young children home.
[02:31:37.441 --> 02:31:40.683]  Mean-spirited and un-American.
[02:31:40.743 --> 02:31:42.183]  I can't do a whoops.
[02:31:42.343 --> 02:31:43.064]  I'm stuck.
[02:31:43.144 --> 02:31:43.664]  I can't do it.
[02:31:43.704 --> 02:31:43.984]  Whoops.
[02:31:44.044 --> 02:31:46.225]  Put up the graphic of this.
[02:32:05.987 --> 02:32:09.392]  Thank you.
[02:32:10.173 --> 02:32:18.665]  But now the man who claims to be the little girl's father says she was in fact not separated from her mother.
[02:32:19.145 --> 02:32:21.408]  The Democrats want open borders.
[02:32:22.813 --> 02:32:25.594]  Tensions boiling over at the U.S.-Mexico border.
[02:32:25.634 --> 02:32:25.754]  U.S.
[02:32:25.894 --> 02:32:28.495]  agents shot tear gas into the crowd of migrants.
[02:32:28.515 --> 02:32:31.556]  That tear gas injured two children earlier today.
[02:32:31.576 --> 02:32:37.179]  Reuters photographers snapping these images, appearing to show a woman trying to rush two children to safety.
[02:32:37.239 --> 02:32:42.080]  There are those questioning the use of the tear gas on the women and children.
[02:32:42.301 --> 02:32:46.762]  What I find unconscionable is that people would intentionally take children into this situation.
[02:32:46.942 --> 02:32:48.503]  The caravan, as we call them,
[02:32:48.663 --> 02:32:53.484]  Would push women and children towards the front and then begin basically rocking our agency.
[02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:57.485]  Those are people coming to the border as far as you know for asylum, isn't it?
[02:32:58.026 --> 02:32:59.326]  I do not believe that is true.
[02:33:06.348 --> 02:33:09.029]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:18.821 --> 02:33:22.164]  Welcome back.
[02:33:22.844 --> 02:33:35.953]  You know, we talk about the hypocrisy of the Democrats, especially when we talk about what happened at the border.
[02:33:37.134 --> 02:33:38.135]  We got a
[02:33:48.587 --> 02:33:52.831]  Presenter, the co-host, Sonny Poston, I guess is the way you pronounce it.
[02:33:52.851 --> 02:33:53.691]  I don't watch The View.
[02:33:53.911 --> 02:33:57.755]  I don't know who this person is, but she's co-host of The View on ABC.
[02:33:58.875 --> 02:34:01.878]  And on Wednesday, she said, I don't care what Obama did.
[02:34:03.279 --> 02:34:06.001]  Trump used tear gas at the border.
[02:34:06.702 --> 02:34:10.765]  It doesn't matter that Obama did it 80 times or whatever.
[02:34:11.045 --> 02:34:14.768]  And the conservative press
[02:34:15.691 --> 02:34:19.452]  Pushes back, and we should push back against this kind of hypocrisy.
[02:34:20.233 --> 02:34:25.135]  I was just talking about the environmentalism in the last segment.
[02:34:25.175 --> 02:34:26.375]  We've got Legoland.
[02:34:26.535 --> 02:34:32.638]  This is a place, as Reason Magazine points out, a theme park that is dedicated to celebrating plastic.
[02:34:33.258 --> 02:34:34.398]  Plastic toy bricks.
[02:34:34.538 --> 02:34:40.701]  Legoland in the UK has said that they're no longer going to have single-use plastic straws.
[02:34:42.538 --> 02:34:45.699]  You know, this is the kind of virtue signaling that we see, the kind of hypocrisy.
[02:34:46.219 --> 02:34:48.099]  But of course, these people out here say, we don't care.
[02:34:48.119 --> 02:34:49.339]  And obviously, we know they don't care.
[02:34:49.399 --> 02:34:52.780]  We know that they don't care that there is a double standard.
[02:34:52.820 --> 02:34:54.040]  And we defend that.
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:55.760]  We say, well, that is hypocrisy.
[02:34:56.781 --> 02:34:59.041]  And it's right to point out that hypocrisy.
[02:34:59.081 --> 02:35:04.982]  But at the same time, as I said a couple of days ago, I said, but don't you see a problem with that?
[02:35:05.322 --> 02:35:10.383]  When we double down and say, President Trump is not doing anything that President Obama didn't do at the border.
[02:35:11.718 --> 02:35:13.939]  And that's true in many ways.
[02:35:14.179 --> 02:35:17.460]  I mean, we've got the military there, but they're going to be coming home.
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:20.241]  They're not there actually enforcing the border.
[02:35:20.301 --> 02:35:26.303]  We've got people all over the press in Washington wringing their hands and saying, how dare you!
[02:35:27.654 --> 02:35:28.274]  Use the U.S.
[02:35:28.314 --> 02:35:29.655]  military to protect our border.
[02:35:29.675 --> 02:35:32.255]  You know, it's for empire purposes, right?
[02:35:32.616 --> 02:35:37.937]  They should be protecting the border between, you know, Turkey and Syria.
[02:35:38.517 --> 02:35:43.439]  Or they should, whatever, I mean, you know, put them up there in the Kurdish area.
[02:35:43.499 --> 02:35:45.419]  But don't have them protect our border.
[02:35:45.439 --> 02:35:47.120]  Don't have them protect our country.
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:50.881]  They can protect Iraq and Afghanistan, but not our country.
[02:35:52.822 --> 02:35:53.643]  That's the insanity.
[02:35:54.523 --> 02:35:56.945]  Nobody ever questions the U.S.
[02:35:56.985 --> 02:35:58.446]  military being sent anywhere.
[02:35:58.466 --> 02:36:10.015]  Of course, in terms of the mainstream media or the people in Washington, they never question any directive of the President to send troops anywhere for any reason, except at the U.S.
[02:36:10.055 --> 02:36:11.476]  border to protect our country.
[02:36:12.597 --> 02:36:19.081]  And when we come back and we say, he's okay, he's not doing anything that President Obama did, that I think is a problem.
[02:36:19.762 --> 02:36:20.963]  He needs to do a lot more.
[02:36:22.062 --> 02:36:29.884]  And I think it shows that we have lost a lot of our resolve when we can't get in their face and say that it's not a problem.
[02:36:30.204 --> 02:36:33.145]  We have to appeal to the fact that President Obama did it.
[02:36:34.085 --> 02:36:40.367]  We had the Democrats, even though they've now won in the House, they're now $18 million in debt already.
[02:36:41.824 --> 02:36:45.005]  Remember, Hillary Clinton got control of the DNC because they were so heavily in debt.
[02:36:45.645 --> 02:36:53.407]  She was able to buy them with the corrupt winnings that she got out of the Clinton Foundation, wound up owning them, and now they're already in that situation again, right after this election.
[02:36:53.427 --> 02:36:59.129]  Yeah, they won, but they are now in debt, and they're going to put all of us in a lot more debt very quickly.
[02:36:59.769 --> 02:37:04.691]  And then we have our new speaker, same as the old speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
[02:37:05.431 --> 02:37:08.772]  I pointed out a couple of days ago, let's remember she's already been caught
[02:37:09.864 --> 02:37:15.368]  Doing some suspicious trades, buying futures that are going to expire at the beginning of 2020.
[02:37:16.209 --> 02:37:29.719]  And Nancy Pelosi was featured as the key person in an expose back in 2011, November 2011, of insider trading.
[02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:34.323]  They came up with the Stock Act that was supposed to stop that.
[02:37:35.445 --> 02:37:38.066]  They even had the Pelosi provision as part of that.
[02:37:38.086 --> 02:37:39.987]  I mean, she was the poster child for that thing.
[02:37:40.947 --> 02:37:44.329]  And yet she cleverly turned that around and complained that the Republicans hadn't done enough.
[02:37:45.809 --> 02:37:50.191]  Well, a year after they got that passed, they eviscerated it.
[02:37:51.291 --> 02:37:52.692]  So it basically didn't apply anymore.
[02:37:53.092 --> 02:37:55.493]  See, Congress can do insider trading.
[02:37:55.513 --> 02:38:00.475]  The people who can subsidize a particular corporation
[02:38:01.331 --> 02:38:09.940]  Or they can target a particular corporation, or they can reward or destroy an entire industry, as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton wanted to do to the coal industry.
[02:38:11.121 --> 02:38:17.287]  Or they can, you know, say we're going to move towards electric cars, or we're going to subsidize Solyndra, or whatever.
[02:38:17.587 --> 02:38:23.853]  These people who have that kind of power can, without any threat of criminal prosecution,
[02:38:24.704 --> 02:38:25.024]  I think so.
[02:38:50.805 --> 02:38:52.946]  I couldn't be more honored.
[02:38:53.386 --> 02:38:54.806]  That is a figure of speech.
[02:38:55.546 --> 02:39:01.188]  But it's in fact, in this case, as true as any statement anyone could ever make.
[02:39:01.608 --> 02:39:12.531]  To be honored by the nominations of those who placed my name in nomination and the support that I have from our colleagues in this caucus.
[02:39:12.771 --> 02:39:18.453]  As I say, our diversity is our strength, but our unity is our power.
[02:39:19.133 --> 02:39:24.655]  And we will use that power again in a unifying way for our country.
[02:39:24.675 --> 02:39:25.995]  I'm very proud.
[02:39:26.015 --> 02:39:28.256]  We look forward to the results, whatever they are.
[02:39:28.716 --> 02:39:38.940]  They will be intense and they will be a vote of confidence to send me my name to the floor that I'm proud to be the nominee of the House Democratic Caucus.
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:40.342]  There you go.
[02:39:40.362 --> 02:39:43.406]  $18 million in debt already, the Democrat Party is.
[02:39:43.446 --> 02:39:45.169]  They have a speaker who cannot speak.
[02:39:45.249 --> 02:39:48.094]  As President Trump was saying, I'd like to see Nancy Pelosi a speaker.
[02:39:48.154 --> 02:39:51.359]  That's evidence as to why he would like her to be speaker.
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:54.484]  And what she does exhibit...
[02:39:55.595 --> 02:39:57.396]  is a death grip on power.
[02:39:57.596 --> 02:40:00.698]  She is not going to give it up for any way, shape or form, folks.
[02:40:01.198 --> 02:40:07.501]  She said, I'm not going to say when I'm going to leave because that would put me in a position of being a lame duck speaker.
[02:40:07.541 --> 02:40:10.262]  Well, she is a lame speaker if she's not a lame duck.
[02:40:10.502 --> 02:40:12.703]  But the Clintons are not really much better.
[02:40:13.364 --> 02:40:15.905]  And again, they have that death grip on power.
[02:40:16.545 --> 02:40:19.727]  They've begun, Hillary and Bill have begun their tour
[02:40:20.863 --> 02:40:22.285]  They had a problem selling tickets.
[02:40:22.445 --> 02:40:25.608]  Even though they were going as low as $6.55, they were only able to sell 3,300 tickets.
[02:40:30.265 --> 02:40:38.728]  In an arena that holds 19,800, they were only able to fill, in other words, 17% of the seats.
[02:40:39.908 --> 02:40:45.230]  And like Nancy Pelosi, Hillary had a great deal of trouble speaking.
[02:40:45.350 --> 02:40:51.512]  She had another coughing fit, even as nobody was coughing up money to go hear them speak.
[02:40:51.792 --> 02:40:58.134]  Even Paul Ryan is talking about the bizarre results of the California midterm elections.
[02:40:59.093 --> 02:41:01.855]  He said, this really justifies logic to me.
[02:41:01.895 --> 02:41:15.824]  And as I look at what he had to say about this, it kind of reminds me of the back and forth between Jeff Sessions when he was a senator and Leon Panetta when he was Secretary of State.
[02:41:17.105 --> 02:41:21.008]  And, I'm sorry, not Secretary, Secretary of Defense.
[02:41:21.048 --> 02:41:25.271]  He was talking about whether or not they would send troops into Syria without getting the Congress' approval.
[02:41:26.363 --> 02:41:29.045]  And Leon Panetta is saying, yeah, we'll let you know what we decide.
[02:41:29.065 --> 02:41:30.286]  We'll talk to the UN and NATO.
[02:41:30.326 --> 02:41:31.466]  We'll decide and let you know.
[02:41:31.486 --> 02:41:35.909]  And he goes, well, golly shucks, I can't even believe what you're telling me there.
[02:41:36.269 --> 02:41:37.530]  You know what the Constitution says.
[02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:39.792]  And so we got the same type of thing going on with Paul Ryan.
[02:41:39.812 --> 02:41:42.173]  He says, this just defies logic to me.
[02:41:42.433 --> 02:41:45.075]  We were only down 26 seats the night of the election.
[02:41:45.115 --> 02:41:47.557]  Three weeks later, we lost basically every California race.
[02:41:48.317 --> 02:41:54.042]  This election system they have, I can't begin to understand what ballot harvesting is.
[02:41:54.062 --> 02:41:59.507]  Of course, he's from Wisconsin, so he doesn't talk like Gomer Pyle, but he acts like Gomer Pyle.
[02:41:59.787 --> 02:42:01.388]  These people just go along with his stuff.
[02:42:01.788 --> 02:42:03.110]  They don't call it for what it is.
[02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:09.095]  He says the way this absentee ballot program used to work, the way it works now, it seems pretty loosey-goosey.
[02:42:10.216 --> 02:42:11.657]  It seems pretty corrupt to me.
[02:42:12.037 --> 02:42:13.538]  We all understand what's going on.
[02:42:14.059 --> 02:42:16.321]  And we all understand that these guys aren't going to do anything to fix it.
[02:42:17.386 --> 02:42:20.953]  That's the most amazing thing to me, is that they're not going to do anything to fix it.
[02:42:22.553 --> 02:42:27.036]  We've got coming up in the next segment, we're going to be talking to Harrison Smith.
[02:42:27.056 --> 02:42:27.717]  He's up in New York.
[02:42:27.757 --> 02:42:38.684]  He's going to give us an update on what's going on with the Laura Loomer protest there at Twitter where she handcuffed herself to the front door of Twitter and refused to leave.
[02:42:38.704 --> 02:42:41.806]  They eventually arrested her, removed her from the site.
[02:42:41.847 --> 02:42:43.328]  He's going to give us an update on that.
[02:42:43.368 --> 02:42:45.909]  He was there on the scene.
[02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:47.130]  So stay with us.
[02:42:47.170 --> 02:42:49.612]  We'll be right back and we'll talk about the First Amendment.
[02:43:02.663 --> 02:43:04.804]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[02:43:04.864 --> 02:43:10.628]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[02:43:10.728 --> 02:43:13.149]  Thank you for telling me that.
[02:43:13.289 --> 02:43:15.270]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[02:43:15.871 --> 02:43:18.172]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[02:43:18.232 --> 02:43:19.553]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[02:43:19.573 --> 02:43:20.994]  But do you think that you deem it an invasion?
[02:43:21.014 --> 02:43:24.576]  Jim Acosta told the President that the caravan didn't exist.
[02:43:25.957 --> 02:43:31.200]  And then, of course, they also said that it didn't exist when he pulled the microphone away and pushed the intern's arm down.
[02:43:32.139 --> 02:43:34.661]  But of course, the caravan does exist.
[02:43:35.241 --> 02:43:37.583]  There's more than 50,000 people still making their way up.
[02:43:38.003 --> 02:43:42.646]  More than 10,000 as of today are already massing on the border.
[02:43:43.166 --> 02:43:51.752]  And I have the camera crew and reporters there on the ground, sending back incredible live feeds and also reports.
[02:43:52.792 --> 02:43:53.753]  But just think about that.
[02:43:54.522 --> 02:44:04.472]  Remember when the PR operative for Obama, Jonathan Gruber, bragged, thank God Americans are so stupid, thank God you have no attention span?
[02:44:04.853 --> 02:44:09.017]  You know, it's not just Jim Acosta that said that there is no caravan.
[02:44:09.298 --> 02:44:15.764]  At first they said, oh, the caravan's all women and children, they're all so sweet, and then they smash over the Guatemala border into Mexico, and okay, well,
[02:44:16.656 --> 02:44:17.557]  They deserve to be here.
[02:44:17.837 --> 02:44:19.458]  And then, oh, they're not violent.
[02:44:19.478 --> 02:44:20.919]  And then, oh, it doesn't exist.
[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:21.560]  You're crazy.
[02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:23.802]  It's something Trump made up for the election.
[02:44:24.302 --> 02:44:32.169]  And now when Trump says, OK, we've beefed up security there, well, now he's a horrible, evil racist for not letting these people in.
[02:44:32.269 --> 02:44:34.831]  And less than 10% are women and children.
[02:44:35.451 --> 02:44:44.679]  And we catch the media cropping photos in a staged event with a woman with two kids with no shoes that just supposedly came up thousands of miles from Central and South America.
[02:44:45.639 --> 02:44:47.380]  And the lies go on and on from there.
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:52.823]  And that's why InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com existing is so critical.
[02:44:53.444 --> 02:45:09.533]  Because the only way for these insane lies to work, saying that there are more than two genders, saying that mother and father is bad, saying that world government doesn't exist while they're promoting it, all the things they're doing, saying the surveillance state's a great thing, but also saying it doesn't exist, all this 1984 garbage,
[02:45:11.834 --> 02:45:14.097]  You can't stand being challenged at all.
[02:45:14.217 --> 02:45:28.677]  And that's why all over the world a reign of censorship is coming in, in a perfect storm of dying corporate media, big mega-corporations, authoritarian regimes like Communist China, the EU, the Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down.
[02:45:29.779 --> 02:45:39.102]  Loyal Americans and other loyal nationalists and just people that want free market and success and know that the American system, while not perfect, has been the best the world ever saw.
[02:45:39.483 --> 02:45:48.666]  And we don't want to adopt this crony capitalist model like Communist China has done, where the heads of the party are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and the general public starving to death.
[02:45:49.486 --> 02:45:51.368]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[02:45:51.448 --> 02:45:52.889]  This is sick.
[02:45:53.290 --> 02:45:55.892]  This is an attack on common sense, an attack on logic.
[02:45:56.393 --> 02:45:58.494]  And that's why InfoWars is more important than ever.
[02:45:59.195 --> 02:46:01.497]  We've got live feeds every day with our reporters.
[02:46:01.858 --> 02:46:04.080]  It's amazing at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:12.949]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas and this holiday season, all of you remember that without you supporting InfoWars financially, we will be shut down.
[02:46:13.390 --> 02:46:14.611]  And we make it easy to do.

[02:47:33.567 --> 02:47:33.987]  Welcome back.
[02:47:34.007 --> 02:47:37.811]  We're going to be going to Harrison Smith in New York, our own InfoWars reporter.
[02:47:37.831 --> 02:47:46.579]  He's been covering Laura Loomer's protest for the First Amendment and how it is being shut down by these people in social media.
[02:47:46.599 --> 02:47:49.742]  We're going to get an update as to what's going on up there with Laura.
[02:47:50.062 --> 02:47:57.108]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to tell you about some of the specials that we have as part of our Cyber Week specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:47:57.128 --> 02:47:59.451]  You know, we were talking earlier about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[02:48:00.211 --> 02:48:02.453]  Noticing that your nose is getting a bit red.
[02:48:02.493 --> 02:48:09.180]  Maybe it's because you've got a lot of allergies, dander, asthma, smoke, germs, a lot of things in the home.
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:14.865]  You know, the home, as we shut it up this time of year, trying to keep the house warm.
[02:48:15.606 --> 02:48:18.348]  It can be some of the most polluted air you come across.
[02:48:18.668 --> 02:48:19.929]  And we have the answer for that.
[02:48:19.989 --> 02:48:22.331]  And we've got it on massive discount right now.
[02:48:22.351 --> 02:48:26.954]  You can save $127 off the Alexa Pure Breeze Air Purifier.
[02:48:26.994 --> 02:48:29.155]  We have them all over the office here.
[02:48:29.776 --> 02:48:31.557]  These things are wonderful.
[02:48:32.197 --> 02:48:35.499]  They're silent, you don't hear them, but they're very, very effective.
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:38.201]  And they're also kind of entertaining to watch.
[02:48:38.361 --> 02:48:42.524]  You can see, if you see that picture there, they've got like a wave at the top that's lit up.
[02:48:43.645 --> 02:48:45.006]  It changes color.
[02:48:45.826 --> 02:48:51.348]  If it detects anything in the environment and it can also pick up and start moving the air a little bit quicker.
[02:48:51.368 --> 02:48:53.329]  But even in the highest mode you don't really hear it.
[02:48:54.049 --> 02:49:02.011]  It'll change color from blue to on the other extreme red and in between you'll see purple and that sort of thing as it detects something there.
[02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:04.592]  It removes 99.97% of airborne toxins and contaminants in your home.
[02:49:06.813 --> 02:49:09.534]  Things like dust, pollen, smoke, dander, many other things.
[02:49:09.874 --> 02:49:19.178]  It's got a patented ion cluster technology, true HEPA filter system that is 33% more effective than HEPA type imitators.
[02:49:19.992 --> 02:49:21.813]  And again, I use this in my home.
[02:49:21.853 --> 02:49:22.853]  It's very, very effective.
[02:49:23.393 --> 02:49:27.115]  You can get this as part of the specials that we have at InfoWars, part of our Cyber Week specials.
[02:49:27.155 --> 02:49:31.416]  We have up to 75% off storewide, plus free shipping, double Patriot Points.
[02:49:31.436 --> 02:49:32.457]  That's our reward system.
[02:49:32.517 --> 02:49:34.998]  We have things set aside there.
[02:49:35.038 --> 02:49:39.139]  We have gifts under $25, under $50, under $100.
[02:49:39.579 --> 02:49:43.981]  We even have a section where we have broken down gifts by gender, by both of them.
[02:49:45.141 --> 02:49:48.322]  You can see, guess for him, guess for her, even stocking stuffers.
[02:49:49.102 --> 02:49:54.604]  Take an opportunity to look at the massive discount specials and free shipping that we have at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:54.624 --> 02:49:56.765]  We really do appreciate your support.
[02:49:57.265 --> 02:50:01.966]  Alright, let's go to New York right now and get an update on the situation with Laura Loomer.
[02:50:02.566 --> 02:50:03.827]  Thank you for joining us, Harrison.
[02:50:04.067 --> 02:50:05.867]  Harrison Smith is our reporter on site.
[02:50:05.907 --> 02:50:07.468]  What's going on with Laura, Harrison?
[02:50:09.091 --> 02:50:09.491]  Absolutely.
[02:50:09.571 --> 02:50:11.872]  Well, uh, I'm not sure what's going on with Laura right now.
[02:50:11.892 --> 02:50:17.013]  I can tell you that the, uh, the, uh, protest yesterday was just a massive, massive success.
[02:50:17.033 --> 02:50:19.973]  I can tell you that Twitter is still absolutely abuzz.
[02:50:20.013 --> 02:50:24.034]  I mean, literally everybody I follow is talking about Laura Loomer.
[02:50:24.074 --> 02:50:26.315]  This protest was a success on all fronts.
[02:50:26.335 --> 02:50:29.175]  And I apologize if, uh, if it's a little bit hard to hear me.
[02:50:29.195 --> 02:50:32.696]  We're here on the corner of, uh, uh, you know, on the corner of the street in New York.
[02:50:32.936 --> 02:50:34.157]  No, no, you're coming across fine.
[02:50:34.177 --> 02:50:35.317]  It turns out there isn't one.
[02:50:35.537 --> 02:50:35.957]  Okay, great.
[02:50:36.724 --> 02:50:37.545]  Yeah, coming across time.
[02:50:37.765 --> 02:50:40.647]  You know, it's good, too, that we get out there and we protest this.
[02:50:40.667 --> 02:50:43.269]  There's a lot of different approaches that we can take to this.
[02:50:43.569 --> 02:50:54.498]  And I saw an article on Reason Magazine today taking people to task for saying that we should come after these people in terms of antitrust.
[02:50:54.998 --> 02:50:57.481]  I think we ought to be coming after them in every regard.
[02:50:57.701 --> 02:51:06.669]  I think that we need to be looking at coming up with other platforms and trying to move things over to that, but we also should come after them with antitrust.
[02:51:06.709 --> 02:51:14.177]  We should make a point of saying that we've had a Supreme Court decision saying even if they own the public square,
[02:51:14.977 --> 02:51:18.501]  If a private corporation owns a public square, they still can't take our free speech off of that.
[02:51:18.541 --> 02:51:27.109]  But I see a lot of people out there, and this is the reasoning of Reason Magazine, they said censorship is only when the government limits free speech.
[02:51:27.249 --> 02:51:28.090]  I don't agree with that.
[02:51:28.651 --> 02:51:29.552]  I don't agree with that at all.
[02:51:29.592 --> 02:51:36.598]  I think that that's a human right, and I don't think that the government, that corporations should be allowed to take that anymore than should be allowed to take any of our other property.
[02:51:36.638 --> 02:51:37.019]  Do you agree?
[02:51:38.644 --> 02:51:39.725]  Right, no, that's exactly right.
[02:51:39.765 --> 02:51:44.248]  And actually, that was one of the arguments that we had with some of the counter-protesters at the protest yesterday.
[02:51:44.569 --> 02:51:47.611]  And if you want to see that video, it's on the InfoWars Live Facebook.
[02:51:47.931 --> 02:51:56.918]  It's about two hours long, but scroll through and find the parts where people are, just people on the side who walk up and see the protest, or people who saw it on Twitter and show up when they're arguing with each other.
[02:51:57.038 --> 02:51:59.060]  It's really, I mean, it's really good stuff.
[02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:00.881]  It's really good arguments, honestly.
[02:52:01.261 --> 02:52:02.562]  And that was the argument that I made.
[02:52:02.582 --> 02:52:05.665]  You know, these people saying, well, the First Amendment only stops the government
[02:52:06.085 --> 02:52:06.285]  Yeah.
[02:52:06.305 --> 02:52:06.585]  Yeah.
[02:52:36.025 --> 02:52:40.748]  Yeah, well, you know, we heard it from Thomas Jefferson and the Founding Fathers when they wrote the Declaration of Independence.
[02:52:40.788 --> 02:52:48.373]  They said we've got certain rights that we possess as human beings, whether you want to acknowledge a creator or just acknowledge your humanity.
[02:52:48.613 --> 02:52:53.497]  We have these inherent rights and we create governments to protect those rights.
[02:52:54.337 --> 02:52:59.641]  And it's not just protecting... We don't just have the government to protect our rights from the government.
[02:53:00.061 --> 02:53:02.963]  The government is there to protect our rights from being taken by anybody.
[02:53:03.083 --> 02:53:11.050]  You know, and that includes, you know, somebody coming up and holding you up or, you know, at the point of a gun or whether they use a lawyer to take away your stuff.
[02:53:11.590 --> 02:53:13.432]  You know, that's the issue there.
[02:53:13.472 --> 02:53:20.518]  And so when a big corporation, when the biggest corporations are out there robbing us of our God-given rights to free speech and to
[02:53:21.458 --> 02:53:33.070]  Be able to communicate with other people in the public square because they privately own it That's something where the government should get involved and the government should get involved not by making up rules But but just by saying don't do that.
[02:53:33.230 --> 02:53:34.652]  You know we're gonna have complete freedom
[02:53:36.181 --> 02:53:40.502]  Right, and with things like Twitter and Facebook, there is no recourse through them.
[02:53:40.522 --> 02:53:44.564]  I mean, you can appeal to them, but if they say no, well, you're screwed.
[02:53:44.604 --> 02:53:47.385]  I mean, that's basically as far as you can go with them.
[02:53:47.905 --> 02:53:50.686]  Some people are asking, you know, well, Lord, do you think they'll ever reinstate you?
[02:53:50.726 --> 02:53:56.248]  Do you think, you know, this protest that you did yesterday will get you any closer to regaining your Twitter account?
[02:53:56.528 --> 02:54:03.030]  It's kind of like, well, it's really at the whim of these liberals in New York who can do whatever they want, there's no oversight, there's no
[02:54:03.770 --> 02:54:06.554]  Uh, no one telling them, oh, you have to let people have free speech.
[02:54:06.774 --> 02:54:08.877]  If they say no, you know, that's it, and it's over.
[02:54:08.897 --> 02:54:20.093]  And, uh, you know, so what Laura did yesterday was really important in just bringing awareness to the fact that this is happening, to try to prevent it from happening in the future, try to, uh, raise people's awareness so people can...
[02:54:20.473 --> 02:54:21.914]  I hear people honking the horn there.
[02:54:22.034 --> 02:54:23.714]  I know that from being in New York.
[02:54:23.834 --> 02:54:27.255]  We were up there once and they have these signs all over the place.
[02:54:27.275 --> 02:54:28.436]  $300 fine if you honk your horn.
[02:54:28.496 --> 02:54:31.797]  And everybody's doing that constantly in New York.
[02:54:31.877 --> 02:54:34.158]  And my family was all laughing about that.
[02:54:34.338 --> 02:54:36.799]  It's like they could make a fortune if they just wanted to enforce that.
[02:54:37.419 --> 02:54:38.079]  But that's the thing.
[02:54:38.119 --> 02:54:44.702]  I mean, we have rules and the rules are not typically enforced, even by the government, but certainly not by Twitter.
[02:54:44.722 --> 02:54:46.583]  They have different standards for different people.
[02:54:46.623 --> 02:54:47.023]  We know that.
[02:54:47.083 --> 02:54:48.824]  We've seen that over and over again.
[02:54:49.144 --> 02:54:53.026]  And I'm very distressed to see libertarians or conservatives come out.
[02:54:53.466 --> 02:54:59.249]  In many cases, they believe that corporations can do no wrong, just like socialists believe that government can do no wrong.
[02:54:59.649 --> 02:55:01.310]  And quite frankly, they all can do wrong.
[02:55:01.330 --> 02:55:03.951]  You can have wrong acts committed by all of them.
[02:55:04.031 --> 02:55:05.752]  And we've already had a Supreme Court decision
[02:55:06.532 --> 02:55:17.100]  Back in 1946, saying that even if, and it was a literal case where they had a company own a town and they shut down a woman who was handing out literature.
[02:55:17.861 --> 02:55:21.484]  She was a Jehovah's Witness, I think, and she was handing out literature.
[02:55:21.524 --> 02:55:22.785]  It was Marsh v. Alabama, 1946.
[02:55:23.245 --> 02:55:28.389]  They said, even though they own the public square, you can't shut down people's free speech.
[02:55:28.469 --> 02:55:29.350]  It's just that simple.
[02:55:29.430 --> 02:55:31.231]  But the government wants this.
[02:55:31.591 --> 02:55:33.393]  And that's the other thing that's missing in this equation.
[02:55:34.433 --> 02:55:40.920]  Libertarians and conservatives believe that Twitter and these other people were not created in a public-private partnership.
[02:55:41.380 --> 02:55:45.884]  They don't understand that the government is directing this censorship in many cases.
[02:55:45.964 --> 02:55:59.357]  It's the NATO, Atlantic Council, these other organizations, these neocon, never-Trump organizations are the ones that are pushing this and liberals don't understand that it's many times it's these neocon conservatives that are pushing this kind of censorship.
[02:56:00.675 --> 02:56:10.337]  Right, and you can understand from the government's perspective why they would want to do this, because as corrupt as our system is and as controlled as our governmental system is, at least we still have the semblance of control over it.
[02:56:10.357 --> 02:56:11.217]  We still have a vote.
[02:56:11.477 --> 02:56:16.558]  We can still, in theory, elect people who will represent us and will uphold our rights.
[02:56:16.838 --> 02:56:26.080]  Whereas, you know, of course, if you're in the government and you want to clamp down on people's free speech, you're going to go to the corporations where people have absolutely no recompense.
[02:56:26.100 --> 02:56:28.180]  They have absolutely no way of leveraging power
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:29.100]  We're good to go.
[02:56:53.066 --> 02:56:53.406]  That's good.
[02:57:17.751 --> 02:57:18.172]  That's good.
[02:57:18.532 --> 02:57:23.277]  I've seen too many times where people excuse it because they don't like your speech.
[02:57:23.498 --> 02:57:26.641]  And that basically is a test of whether or not you believe in free speech.
[02:57:27.022 --> 02:57:32.207]  You're going to believe in free speech if you are going to put it out there for people that you don't agree with.
[02:57:32.788 --> 02:57:34.269]  Well, that's very interesting.
[02:57:34.289 --> 02:57:42.457]  I'm glad to hear that there are still people walking by that even if they haven't heard this, they haven't heard it spun, I guess, by Stephen Colbert.
[02:57:43.017 --> 02:57:48.222]  And people on the left, so they still are kicking in to supporting free speech.
[02:57:48.282 --> 02:57:51.144]  Thank you for joining us, Harrison Smith, and that's our program.
[02:57:51.184 --> 02:57:51.965]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:57:55.908 --> 02:57:57.089]  I need massive funding.
[02:57:57.109 --> 02:57:58.249]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:57:58.669 --> 02:58:00.310]  Cyber Week's going on right now.
[02:58:00.370 --> 02:58:01.451]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:58:01.471 --> 02:58:02.672]  50-75% off.
[02:58:03.612 --> 02:58:04.813]  A lot of it's lost leaders.
[02:58:05.193 --> 02:58:06.453]  And double page reappointment.
[02:58:06.493 --> 02:58:07.694]  It's got to end in a couple days.
[02:58:07.954 --> 02:58:11.456]  Whatever the best products are that people need that help folks.
[02:58:11.776 --> 02:58:13.477]  And that also help us fund our operation.
[02:58:13.597 --> 02:58:14.058]  I sell it.
[02:58:14.278 --> 02:58:19.621]  And if you take the Alexa Pure Pro Gravity-Fed Stainless Steel Water Filtration System, they ordered too many this year.
[02:58:19.801 --> 02:58:21.602]  They want to sell them so they don't have inventory problems.
[02:58:21.622 --> 02:58:22.783]  They have to pay tax on that.
[02:58:22.823 --> 02:58:24.464]  So they're selling them to us at cost.
[02:58:24.584 --> 02:58:26.165]  We make 30-something bucks on these.
[02:58:26.386 --> 02:58:28.527]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:58:28.567 --> 02:58:31.589]  This deal is beyond the best you'll ever find.
[02:58:31.709 --> 02:58:32.630]  Alexa Pure Pro.
[02:58:32.650 --> 02:58:35.832]  And it's part of our Cyber Week Sale.
[02:58:35.852 --> 02:58:37.012]  50 to 75% off.
[02:58:37.212 --> 02:58:38.213]  Double Patriot Points.
[02:58:38.253 --> 02:58:41.015]  That's 10%, not 5% on your next order for every dollar you spend.

[02:59:18.662 --> 02:59:22.624]  Jam it down their throat as a badge of honor to be demonized and lied about.
[02:59:22.864 --> 02:59:30.069]  Of the collaborators and the cowards and the filth that have all signed on to worshiping the pedophilia and worshiping the devil worship.
[02:59:30.289 --> 02:59:30.950]  Well guess what?
[02:59:31.090 --> 02:59:41.797]  I'm real proud to be enemy number one up against these people and thank God for Trump flying that banner of Americana and no compromise and no compromise for Christianity and everything.
[02:59:41.977 --> 02:59:43.058]  God bless President Trump.
[02:59:43.398 --> 02:59:48.722]  I'm proud to stand by and watch all the other cowards hedge their bets and double talk behind the president's back.
[02:59:49.002 --> 02:59:49.363]  Not me!
[03:00:03.771 --> 03:00:08.534]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[03:00:08.914 --> 03:00:18.640]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a
[03:00:18.660 --> 03:00:24.182]  24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[03:00:24.522 --> 03:00:35.706]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[03:00:36.586 --> 03:00:42.248]  While the old guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape rocked by innovation and technology,
[03:00:42.828 --> 03:00:46.470]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[03:00:47.010 --> 03:00:58.556]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[03:00:59.617 --> 03:01:08.501]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[03:01:08.761 --> 03:01:10.382]  Demand truth.
[03:01:10.422 --> 03:01:12.043]  Demand InfoWars.
[03:01:18.755 --> 03:01:26.103]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[03:01:26.723 --> 03:01:28.545]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:01:41.906 --> 03:01:45.188]  If you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.
[03:01:45.448 --> 03:01:49.171]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[03:01:49.231 --> 03:01:56.016]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[03:01:57.017 --> 03:01:59.638]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[03:02:00.239 --> 03:02:02.580]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:03.981]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[03:02:04.021 --> 03:02:06.063]  Do you think that you demonized immigrants?
[03:02:06.543 --> 03:02:08.344]  Trump is like a racist Paul Revere, you know?
[03:02:08.384 --> 03:02:09.144]  The migrants are coming!
[03:02:09.164 --> 03:02:10.065]  The migrants are coming!
[03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:35.392]  Your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[03:02:35.432 --> 03:02:36.132]  Well, that's true.
[03:02:36.172 --> 03:02:37.113]  But they weren't actors.
[03:02:37.133 --> 03:02:38.253]  They're not going to be doing that.
[03:02:38.273 --> 03:02:38.933]  They weren't actors.
[03:02:38.953 --> 03:02:39.394]  No, it's true.
[03:02:39.414 --> 03:02:40.854]  Do you think they were actors?
[03:02:40.914 --> 03:02:41.795]  They weren't actors.
[03:02:41.815 --> 03:02:42.835]  They didn't come from Hollywood.
[03:02:43.095 --> 03:02:44.856]  He keeps calling it an invasion!
[03:02:44.876 --> 03:02:47.357]  Yes, an invasion of strollers.
[03:02:47.757 --> 03:02:54.540]  He made news by ratcheting up the caravans, scare talk, and the troop numbers he believes are needed to meet this alleged threat.
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:55.880]  They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:57.501]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[03:02:57.541 --> 03:02:57.881]  You know what?
[03:02:57.921 --> 03:02:58.842]  That's not an invasion.
[03:02:58.942 --> 03:02:59.422]  Honestly?
[03:02:59.822 --> 03:03:05.563]  I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings will be much better.
[03:03:05.623 --> 03:03:13.485]  If I may answer the question... Tonight, the first 800 migrants from the Central American caravan are at America's doorstep in Tijuana, Mexico.
[03:03:13.805 --> 03:03:17.926]  The first wave of the migrant caravan arrived unexpectedly early at the U.S.
[03:03:18.026 --> 03:03:21.926]  border in Tijuana, where there's been a fortified wall for decades.
[03:03:21.946 --> 03:03:25.287]  They've been looking through the barricade, and some have been climbing it.
[03:03:25.507 --> 03:03:31.169]  They split off from a larger group of about 5,000 and are planning to request asylum here in the U.S.
[03:03:31.309 --> 03:03:33.810]  So the Democrats want open borders.
[03:03:34.570 --> 03:03:35.790]  Let everybody come in.
[03:03:37.411 --> 03:03:38.931]  Let everybody pour in.
[03:03:39.011 --> 03:03:39.832]  We don't care.
[03:03:39.912 --> 03:03:41.652]  Let them come in from the Middle East.
[03:03:42.153 --> 03:03:44.533]  Let them come in from all over the place.
[03:03:45.013 --> 03:03:45.934]  We don't care.
[03:03:46.514 --> 03:03:48.034]  We're not gonna let it happen.
[03:03:48.235 --> 03:03:51.736]  A group of Central American migrants fleeing north to safety, aka
[03:03:54.033 --> 03:03:56.335]  That's called an invasion of our country.
[03:03:56.395 --> 03:03:57.016]  It's pretty obvious.
[03:03:57.036 --> 03:03:58.317]  You don't need me to tell you this, but I will.
[03:03:58.337 --> 03:04:10.867]  The president's firing up his base with the issue that helped propel him into the White House in 2016, which is slamming undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border with Mexico.
[03:04:10.887 --> 03:04:12.689]  He keeps calling it an invasion!
[03:04:12.909 --> 03:04:13.769]  What would you call it?
[03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:16.452]  When Trump said that there was a caravan,
[03:04:17.172 --> 03:04:20.716]  White House has said, no, it's hundreds of miles away from here.
[03:04:20.816 --> 03:04:22.137]  They're hundreds of miles away though.
[03:04:22.157 --> 03:04:23.919]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[03:04:23.939 --> 03:04:25.080]  That's not an invasion.
[03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:30.286]  As many as 4,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Tijuana as soon as tomorrow.
[03:04:30.586 --> 03:04:37.513]  Homeland Security has even said the caravan approaching the border is harboring more than 200 folks with criminal history.
[03:04:37.593 --> 03:04:38.975]  That's called an invasion.
[03:04:41.272 --> 03:04:44.474]  Folks, we're going to come back live on this Friday Global Transmission.
[03:04:44.534 --> 03:04:46.996]  David Knight's coming up as well, and so much more.
[03:04:47.476 --> 03:04:49.037]  This is the most censored show in the world.
[03:04:49.077 --> 03:04:57.403]  Without you spreading the word, without you taking action, they're going to destroy Infowars, and they're going to destroy the country, and they're going to destroy every free person on this planet.
[03:04:57.823 --> 03:05:00.085]  And remember, the government's run by pedophiles.
[03:05:00.105 --> 03:05:03.867]  They want to rape your kids.
[03:05:03.887 --> 03:05:04.368]  Look at that.
[03:05:04.388 --> 03:05:07.069]  Everybody else is just, like, yellow or clear.
[03:05:07.129 --> 03:05:08.510]  That's because it's been denatured.
[03:05:08.530 --> 03:05:09.411]  It's been watered down.
[03:05:09.731 --> 03:05:10.432]  We didn't do that.
[03:05:12.117 --> 03:05:16.238]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something, but this is the very best I can get.
[03:05:16.658 --> 03:05:18.319]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[03:05:18.879 --> 03:05:27.421]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[03:05:27.901 --> 03:05:29.582]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[03:05:29.622 --> 03:05:30.762]  Don't you get the big secret?
[03:05:31.442 --> 03:05:33.943]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[03:05:33.983 --> 03:05:35.083]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[03:05:35.863 --> 03:05:38.784]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[03:05:46.348 --> 03:05:46.688]  Look it up.
[03:05:47.809 --> 03:05:53.814]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[03:05:53.854 --> 03:05:58.717]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[03:05:59.198 --> 03:06:01.799]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4Store.com.
[03:06:17.014 --> 03:06:27.141]  You can listen to the engine moaning out his one-note song.
[03:06:27.721 --> 03:06:34.346]  You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before.
[03:06:37.270 --> 03:06:44.173]  Well, it's hard to believe it's already Friday, November 30th, 2018, and the year is almost over.
[03:06:44.633 --> 03:06:46.193]  And what have we seen?
[03:06:47.774 --> 03:06:49.295]  What have we seen unfold?
[03:06:49.315 --> 03:07:05.721]  We can see the private corporate world government allied with the shycoms and the EU and Hollywood and all their paid-off millions trying to whip this country and other nation-states into submission
[03:07:07.483 --> 03:07:08.484]  To their globalist tyranny.
[03:07:10.004 --> 03:07:19.047]  Right now our president is in South America trying to negotiate a more equitable, fair deal with Communist China and others.
[03:07:19.067 --> 03:07:28.070]  I don't have to go into how China has a totally one-sided deal set up that way by Western elites 50 years ago.
[03:07:29.884 --> 03:07:39.329]  Now they've used it to take China, from a country with almost no running water or electricity 50 years ago, to an industrial juggernaut more powerful than the United States.
[03:07:40.510 --> 03:07:51.716]  They're not more powerful intellectually, they're not more powerful economically, they're not more powerful militarily, but they are industrially way more powerful than the U.S.
[03:07:52.317 --> 03:07:55.679]  The globalists strategically said, Europe and the U.S.
[03:07:55.879 --> 03:07:57.780]  will be service economies.
[03:07:59.482 --> 03:08:11.885]  But a global balance of power, where China doesn't have a big military, and doesn't expand outside their borders, but they're given the deep water ports, they're given the Panama Canal, they're given all the rare earth minerals.
[03:08:12.585 --> 03:08:15.946]  That's a global UN agreement, framework.
[03:08:16.366 --> 03:08:18.467]  How do you think China has 98% of rare earth minerals?
[03:08:19.447 --> 03:08:23.328]  The stuff you need for all the semiconductors, and for all the computers, and all the devices.
[03:08:24.228 --> 03:08:26.229]  Because globally, they've been given that.
[03:08:27.483 --> 03:08:29.905]  By the U.S., by Europe, by the globalists.
[03:08:30.445 --> 03:08:33.227]  They have been set up to win to have the Chinese century.
[03:08:33.247 --> 03:08:36.809]  That's what the CFR teaches in colleges.
[03:08:38.330 --> 03:08:39.951]  And then along came Donald Trump.
[03:08:40.272 --> 03:08:41.693]  Along came Nigel Farage.
[03:08:42.133 --> 03:08:45.475]  Along came all these other patriots now, who said, wait a minute.
[03:08:46.456 --> 03:08:55.422]  We didn't vote to enter these things, and it's all one-sided, and Canada has a 280% tariff on dairy, and we have no tariff, and China has a couple hundred percent.
[03:08:56.634 --> 03:08:57.435]  Tariffs on our goods?
[03:08:57.475 --> 03:08:58.216]  We have nothing on them?
[03:08:58.996 --> 03:09:00.558]  No wonder they've built everything up!
[03:09:00.618 --> 03:09:01.779]  No wonder this has all happened!
[03:09:02.640 --> 03:09:09.766]  But the Communist Party then takes all that money and parlays it into taking over other parts of the world, not even giving their people anything!
[03:09:12.708 --> 03:09:20.175]  That's an easy choice to say we're gonna side with America and with Trump and with our own self-interest and with prosperity and with freedom!
[03:09:22.148 --> 03:09:25.949]  China is the most evil nation the world's ever seen by a long shot.
[03:09:27.312 --> 03:09:29.394]  But it's almost like in the media they don't exist.
[03:09:29.454 --> 03:09:33.417]  Well, they're Asian, so if they kill 100 million people, it's no big deal.
[03:09:33.457 --> 03:09:35.438]  Or if they have human clones, it's no big deal.
[03:09:35.478 --> 03:09:40.942]  Or if they have cows 25 years ago growing humanoids in them for organ harvesting, it's no big deal.
[03:09:40.962 --> 03:09:52.111]  Or if they 20 years ago had cows with human udder cells that produce human milk that's been drunk on Chinese shelves for decades, it's no big deal.
[03:09:53.069 --> 03:09:57.370]  If they've got goats that are part spider that create body armor, it's no big deal.
[03:09:57.991 --> 03:10:01.972]  If they let homeless people just starve to death on the side of the street, it's no big deal.
[03:10:02.132 --> 03:10:05.593]  If they take Christians to death camps and work them to death, it's no big deal.
[03:10:05.953 --> 03:10:07.594]  If they kill Buddhists, it's no big deal.
[03:10:07.794 --> 03:10:11.595]  If they shell Buddhist monasteries in Tibet, it's no big deal!
[03:10:11.615 --> 03:10:14.376]  Because only white people are bad.
[03:10:16.557 --> 03:10:17.657]  And that's the sick culture.
[03:10:18.905 --> 03:10:27.810]  And that's what we face, is a billion, 400 million slaves in China, with almost every party member, only a few thousand of them, being billionaires in China.
[03:10:28.330 --> 03:10:28.891]  Communism.
[03:10:29.411 --> 03:10:36.235]  With ultra-rich people with a bunch of slaves, and our own establishment allied with them, because our own establishment owns a piece of China!
[03:10:37.396 --> 03:10:39.497]  You can move to China and pay zero tax.
[03:10:40.297 --> 03:10:41.318]  As long as you become state-run.
[03:10:44.082 --> 03:10:45.343]  I say it's treason!
[03:10:45.423 --> 03:10:47.243]  And Trump says it's treason!
[03:10:47.724 --> 03:10:49.484]  And we're reversing it, period!
[03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:26.811]  And it's time for Americans to not be intimidated by the thugs that have hijacked our government, and to realize they're a very small group in the command and control positions, and almost everyone below them hates their guts.
[03:11:26.871 --> 03:11:30.632]  The most awake group in this country is the U.S.
[03:11:30.652 --> 03:11:31.032]  government.
[03:11:33.012 --> 03:11:42.774]  90% of the people below it are really freaked out about the fraud, waste, and abuse, and the leftist, and the SJWs being hired to incompetently come in, who are obsessed
[03:11:44.551 --> 03:11:46.793]  Their religion is defecating in the halls.
[03:11:47.313 --> 03:12:05.508]  By the way, if you think I'm joking, and it's in psychology and it always shows up when a society starts to collapse, they caught all over Portland on the local news, businessmen coming out and pooping on the street to be naughty.
[03:12:06.809 --> 03:12:07.970]  White liberal businessmen.
[03:12:10.191 --> 03:12:10.772]  I'm not kidding.
[03:12:12.045 --> 03:12:16.088]  And they thought they would shame them, but the left came out and said, no, we celebrate public defecation.
[03:12:16.508 --> 03:12:20.050]  In Paul Joseph Watson's report, Portland is a S.H.
[03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.731]  you-know-what hole.
[03:12:20.751 --> 03:12:22.492]  It's on Infowars.com.
[03:12:23.132 --> 03:12:24.693]  You want to see the undercover videos of it?
[03:12:24.813 --> 03:12:31.577]  It is a sacrament for them, a religion to crap on the street and make you smell their filth.
[03:12:33.679 --> 03:12:35.260]  Now, why am I starting the show like that?
[03:12:37.421 --> 03:12:38.982]  Because that's who these people are.
[03:12:39.042 --> 03:12:40.723]  They want to hurt your kids.
[03:12:41.084 --> 03:12:42.625]  They want to brain damage your kids.
[03:12:42.845 --> 03:12:44.186]  They want to groom your children.
[03:12:44.366 --> 03:12:45.407]  They want control.
[03:12:45.727 --> 03:12:47.228]  They want to defile things.
[03:12:50.210 --> 03:12:54.713]  And until you start standing up to them, it's only going to get worse.
[03:12:59.716 --> 03:13:04.319]  Now coming up, Roger Stone and I have a battle plan for Trump to take action to defeat these people.
[03:13:04.520 --> 03:13:06.321]  And finally they admit, Robert,
[03:13:07.250 --> 03:13:23.193]  Mueller has filed paperwork in the Michael Cohen case that says Trump is person number one, like we told you years ago, like he's a mafiadon, and that the plan is to indict Trump.
[03:13:23.233 --> 03:13:25.433]  Now, under the Constitution, that indictment will go nowhere.
[03:13:26.053 --> 03:13:28.654]  Separation of powers, but it will be held up like it is.
[03:13:30.434 --> 03:13:31.594]  And that's always been the plan.
[03:13:32.094 --> 03:13:34.555]  There's no obstruction, there's no lying, there's no nothing.
[03:13:34.735 --> 03:13:36.195]  All of it is by Robert Mueller.
[03:13:37.202 --> 03:13:38.723]  And Hillary Clinton and these criminals.
[03:13:38.963 --> 03:13:42.325]  But now, individual number one, clues of Mueller.
[03:13:42.345 --> 03:13:45.728]  We're getting the building blocks, we're told, of what they have.
[03:13:46.168 --> 03:13:50.110]  Yeah, it's called raiding hundreds of lawyers that work for Trump and it's hundreds of properties.
[03:13:50.330 --> 03:13:54.213]  You gotta hire a lawyer that works in the town you're at or is under that state bar.
[03:13:54.773 --> 03:13:57.195]  Finding dirt on a lawyer that has nothing to do with Trump,
[03:13:58.544 --> 03:14:12.051]  They've so far what rated like 20 of Trump's lawyers and then saying 50 years in the penitentiary for the 15 million you laundered Michael Cohen or flip on all the testimony you said that Trump was never involved in this stuff or we'll put you in prison.
[03:14:16.354 --> 03:14:16.954]  We're going to go to break.
[03:14:17.994 --> 03:14:18.595]  We're going to come back.
[03:14:19.395 --> 03:14:21.296]  We're going to go through all of this on the other side.
[03:14:21.716 --> 03:14:25.959]  Please remember that without you supporting us, we will not be here.
[03:14:26.892 --> 03:14:35.477]  Please remember that we're under attack because we're on target and that the videos and the books and the t-shirts and the water filtration and all of it is 50 to 75% off.
[03:14:35.637 --> 03:14:46.263]  Biggest clearance sale ever for Cyber Week and we're going to continue this sale right through until Christmas but a lot of it won't be there because it's going to be sold out.
[03:14:46.523 --> 03:14:50.525]  So whether it's Brain Force or X3 or X2 or SuperMetal Vitality, it's all about to sell out.
[03:14:52.239 --> 03:14:54.564]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:14:59.522 --> 03:15:02.424]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, without you supporting us, we will not be here.
[03:15:02.744 --> 03:15:03.545]  We will not be on air.
[03:15:03.565 --> 03:15:04.846]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:15:04.886 --> 03:15:06.487]  But please, don't fight the crowds.
[03:15:06.908 --> 03:15:08.209]  Don't go through all that garbage.
[03:15:08.449 --> 03:15:09.910]  Don't fight the traffic.
[03:15:10.310 --> 03:15:17.455]  No, the thing to do is to go to InfoWarsTore.com, whether it's emergency radios or optics, just thousands of great items.
[03:15:17.916 --> 03:15:20.017]  Patriot apparel for men and women, it's all there.

[03:15:27.703 --> 03:15:28.964]  These are great products.
[03:15:28.984 --> 03:15:29.164]  You need.
[03:15:29.184 --> 03:15:30.604]  Don't fight the crowd.

[03:15:48.433 --> 03:16:00.380]  All right, coming up, Roger Stone with the biggest news yet, that they filed their intention to indict the president and how to lead counter-strike against these clear and present enemies of this nation, who are declared enemies.
[03:16:02.814 --> 03:16:04.975]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[03:16:05.035 --> 03:16:10.798]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[03:16:10.898 --> 03:16:13.319]  Thank you for telling me that.
[03:16:13.459 --> 03:16:15.440]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:18.341]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[03:16:18.402 --> 03:16:19.662]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[03:16:19.682 --> 03:16:24.725]  But do you think that you demonized... Jim Acosta told the President that the caravan didn't exist.
[03:16:26.085 --> 03:16:31.348]  And then, of course, they also said that it didn't exist when he pulled the microphone away and pushed the intern's arm down.
[03:16:32.313 --> 03:16:34.816]  But of course, the caravan does exist.
[03:16:34.836 --> 03:16:37.739]  There's more than 50,000 people still making their way up.
[03:16:38.159 --> 03:16:42.824]  More than 10,000 as of today are already massing on the border.
[03:16:43.324 --> 03:16:51.933]  And I have the camera crew and reporters there on the ground sending back incredible live feeds and also reports.
[03:16:52.954 --> 03:16:53.935]  But just think about that.
[03:16:54.696 --> 03:17:04.621]  Remember when the PR operative for Obama, Jonathan Gruber, bragged, thank God Americans are so stupid, thank God you have no attention span?
[03:17:05.001 --> 03:17:09.183]  You know, it's not just Jim Acosta that said that there is no caravan.
[03:17:09.443 --> 03:17:15.927]  At first they said, oh, the caravans are all women and children, they're all so sweet, and then they smash over the Guatemala border into Mexico, and okay, well,
[03:17:16.826 --> 03:17:17.706]  They deserve to be here.
[03:17:18.006 --> 03:17:19.607]  And then, oh, they're not violent.
[03:17:19.647 --> 03:17:21.087]  And then, oh, it doesn't exist.
[03:17:21.127 --> 03:17:21.727]  You're crazy.
[03:17:22.347 --> 03:17:23.968]  It's something Trump made up for the election.
[03:17:24.468 --> 03:17:32.310]  And now when Trump says, OK, we've beefed up security there, well, now he's a horrible, evil racist for not letting these people in.
[03:17:32.430 --> 03:17:34.990]  And less than 10% are women and children.
[03:17:35.611 --> 03:17:44.813]  And we catch the media cropping photos in a staged event with a woman with two kids with no shoes that just supposedly came up thousands of miles from Central and South America.
[03:17:45.793 --> 03:17:52.975]  And the lies go on and on from there, and that's why InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com existing is so critical.
[03:17:53.616 --> 03:18:09.681]  Because the only way for these insane lies to work, saying that there are more than two genders, saying that mother and father is bad, saying that world government doesn't exist while they're promoting it, all the things they're doing, saying the surveillance state's a great thing, but also saying it doesn't exist, all this 1984 garbage,
[03:18:12.005 --> 03:18:28.827]  You can't stand being challenged at all and that's why all over the world a reign of censorship is coming in, in a perfect storm of dying corporate media, big mega corporations, authoritarian regimes like Communist China, the EU, the Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down
[03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:39.275]  Loyal Americans and other loyal nationalists and just people that want free market and success and know that the American system, while not perfect, has been the best the world ever saw.
[03:18:39.635 --> 03:18:48.820]  And we don't want to adopt this crony capitalist model like Communist China has done, where the heads of the party are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and the general public starving to death.
[03:18:49.660 --> 03:18:51.542]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[03:18:51.622 --> 03:18:53.044]  This is sick.
[03:18:53.464 --> 03:18:56.066]  This is an attack on common sense, an attack on logic.
[03:18:56.567 --> 03:18:58.669]  And that's why InfoWars is more important than ever.
[03:18:59.350 --> 03:19:01.672]  We've got live feeds every day with our reporters.
[03:19:02.032 --> 03:19:04.255]  It's amazing at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:19:04.915 --> 03:19:13.103]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas and this holiday season, all of you remember that without you supporting InfoWars financially, we will be shut down.
[03:19:13.543 --> 03:19:14.784]  And we make it easy to do.
[03:19:15.184 --> 03:19:16.325]  We've got amazing products.
[03:19:16.365 --> 03:19:24.112]  We've got Cyber Week going right now, extending our big mega sales for Black Friday, while supplies last, of water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements.
[03:19:24.913 --> 03:19:30.034]  T-shirts, books, films, it's all there, and it makes the information war possible against the globalists.
[03:19:30.054 --> 03:19:34.435]  So, I want to thank you this Christmas for your support, and I want to ask you for your continued support.
[03:19:34.815 --> 03:19:38.576]  It's a 360 win because these products are great, and these sales are the biggest ever.
[03:19:38.776 --> 03:19:43.457]  Free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off across the board, and double Patriot points.
[03:19:43.877 --> 03:19:47.218]  Right now, at InfoWareStore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:19:49.258 --> 03:19:58.708]  But whatever you do, take action today and spread the word and spread the live info or links and articles past the censors because when you take action, nothing on earth can stop you.
[03:20:06.216 --> 03:20:08.879]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.244 --> 03:20:30.535]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:35.320 --> 03:20:41.365]  Right before we went on air this morning, I was talking to Roger Stone about the dire straits this country is in and he
[03:20:43.391 --> 03:20:53.778]  Laid into a very cutting, spot-on, five-minute analysis to me that I, a thousand percent, a trillion percent, agree with.
[03:20:53.798 --> 03:21:06.046]  And this is what we must do, what Trump must do, to block the horrible globalist deep staters that openly work with foreign powers, that have openly raised interest rates and tried to talk down the economy to kill the recovery.
[03:21:06.406 --> 03:21:07.707]  These people are the globalists.
[03:21:07.747 --> 03:21:08.448]  They are the plague.
[03:21:08.488 --> 03:21:09.769]  They are the enemy.
[03:21:10.609 --> 03:21:12.631]  And we've told Trump everything that was going to happen.
[03:21:12.651 --> 03:21:14.072]  How he was illegally spied on.
[03:21:14.092 --> 03:21:17.054]  How Hillary still had her emails.
[03:21:17.314 --> 03:21:18.655]  How the NSA has them.
[03:21:19.456 --> 03:21:21.998]  How he was always known as individual number one.
[03:21:22.518 --> 03:21:24.139]  We broke that over a year and a half ago.
[03:21:24.540 --> 03:21:27.322]  And now the Houston Chronicle is the big top story.
[03:21:27.422 --> 03:21:29.504]  Individual number one.
[03:21:29.704 --> 03:21:31.085]  The President's the target.
[03:21:32.628 --> 03:21:36.892]  Mueller and all the Democrats told Trump, oh, you're not the target, we know.
[03:21:36.972 --> 03:21:42.116]  And Rosenstein a few months ago told Trump, sir, we've looked, no evidence, we know there's no Russia.
[03:21:42.757 --> 03:21:44.338]  But they never were going after Russia.
[03:21:45.059 --> 03:21:53.266]  They're going after all his lawyers, trying to find dirt on them to then get them to do a plea bargain to get out of it to lie about the president.
[03:21:53.826 --> 03:21:57.428]  And that is what is going on right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:21:57.728 --> 03:22:06.773]  So without getting into all the minutiae of the latest bull, which is total garbage, and the fact that we have this stool pigeon, pled guilty to $15 million in laundered money, nothing to do with Trump.
[03:22:07.952 --> 03:22:14.359]  Changing all the stories now and saying Trump knew about trying to build a tower, he's got hundreds of towers on the planet, in Russia.
[03:22:15.380 --> 03:22:16.261]  And that's the big proof.
[03:22:17.162 --> 03:22:18.584]  And, oh, they've got to impeach him now.
[03:22:18.644 --> 03:22:19.585]  This is outrageous.
[03:22:19.605 --> 03:22:22.368]  So Trump now knows they're going to move against him.
[03:22:22.668 --> 03:22:28.474]  But there is a clear way, constitutionally, it's not just President Trump's right, it's his duty.
[03:22:29.437 --> 03:22:30.658]  To stand against these people.
[03:22:31.759 --> 03:22:48.556]  And so in the next six and a half minutes, we're going to lay out what has to happen to this illegitimate House, this illegitimate system, this illegitimate election, and these criminals, and what we should do with the subpoenas, what Trump should do with the subpoenas that are coming with all these fake investigations, and how he goes on the offense now.
[03:22:49.037 --> 03:22:52.260]  Roger Stone, former Chief Advisor to the President, break it down for us.
[03:22:54.946 --> 03:23:04.950]  Look, I think this interview that the President gave to the New York Post is really quite incredible because what it shows you is the President has the detonator in his hands.
[03:23:05.410 --> 03:23:23.377]  He now has the goods on their abusive use of FISA warrants, the implications, the treasonous implications of Uranium One, the illegitimate efforts by the Obama administration's FBI to infiltrate the Trump campaign.
[03:23:24.517 --> 03:23:29.760]  And he also now finally has control of his own Justice Department.
[03:23:30.160 --> 03:23:39.704]  Now, clearly the President will release this declassified information at a time of his choosing, but I think he has been woke.
[03:23:39.964 --> 03:23:49.208]  I think he now understands, despite being lulled by Rod Rosenstein and his own initial attorneys, that he is the target.
[03:23:49.388 --> 03:23:52.149]  That the big old target is right on his back.
[03:23:52.509 --> 03:23:59.638]  It's not Roger Stone or Jerry Corsi or Michael Cohn or Alex Jones.
[03:24:00.440 --> 03:24:01.861]  It's none of these people they want.
[03:24:01.921 --> 03:24:03.263]  They want Donald Trump.
[03:24:03.664 --> 03:24:06.848]  And they're trying to euchre him into some kind of perjury trap.
[03:24:07.649 --> 03:24:11.752]  Short of declassifying the documents, what can he do today?
[03:24:12.392 --> 03:24:12.752]  Easy.
[03:24:13.273 --> 03:24:28.022]  Direct the acting Attorney General, Mr. Whitaker, to name a special counsel on the matter of Uranium One and on the matter of the illegal and unconstitutional use of FISA warrants.
[03:24:28.443 --> 03:24:32.085]  Have him immediately convene a grand jury.
[03:24:32.445 --> 03:24:36.728]  Have that grand jury issue indictments of those involved
[03:24:37.228 --> 03:24:40.310]  And they'll then authorize their arrest.
[03:24:40.831 --> 03:24:43.072]  That will bust this wide open.
[03:24:43.753 --> 03:24:56.922]  Is it incidental that the prosecutor leading the investigation into me, Aaron Zelinsky, is the same man who led the cover-up of the Clintons' involvement in Uranium One?
[03:24:57.443 --> 03:24:58.964]  Is that a coincidence?
[03:24:59.464 --> 03:25:19.716]  Is it a coincidence that the other chief prosecutor in the potential prosecution of Roger Stone is Jeannie Rhee, a woman who represented the Clinton Foundation in the matter of the missing emails in which I am being unfairly investigated, since I know nothing about them?
[03:25:20.136 --> 03:25:22.718]  The President needs to go on the offense.
[03:25:23.138 --> 03:25:30.224]  He controls the machinery of the Justice Department now and it must be turned on these criminals immediately.
[03:25:30.444 --> 03:25:38.892]  And he signals he's going to do that and separately in the next two months before they, or the next month and a half before they get this lame duck group in early January.
[03:25:40.177 --> 03:25:44.801]  We need, and the reason I call these Democrats lame duck is this was illegitimate.
[03:25:45.201 --> 03:25:49.825]  They stole these house races in front of God and country.
[03:25:50.345 --> 03:25:54.208]  And the Democrats accused Trump of stealing an election with no evidence.
[03:25:54.528 --> 03:25:55.629]  We have total evidence.
[03:25:55.970 --> 03:26:02.975]  So break down, also following precedent of what Eric Holder did on Fast and Furious, what Trump should do.
[03:26:03.756 --> 03:26:06.378]  Well, there's two very important precedents that have now been set.
[03:26:06.983 --> 03:26:20.315]  The president, in my opinion, should regard any subpoena from the new House Democrats the exact same way that Eric Holder regarded subpoenas from the Republican House regarding Fast and Furious.
[03:26:20.915 --> 03:26:21.556]  Ignore them.
[03:26:21.916 --> 03:26:22.577]  Challenge them.
[03:26:22.637 --> 03:26:23.337]  Yes, we are.
[03:26:40.965 --> 03:26:44.007]  Why should anyone in the Trump administration have to testify?
[03:26:44.407 --> 03:26:47.268]  The election of the House majority is illegitimate.
[03:26:47.628 --> 03:26:54.032]  Just as you don't recognize the election of Donald Trump, we don't recognize the election of a Democratic House.
[03:26:54.452 --> 03:26:57.513]  Sorry, Adam Schiff, you are the chairman of nothing.
[03:26:57.954 --> 03:26:58.934]  Of zero.
[03:26:59.354 --> 03:27:01.375]  Your majority is stolen.
[03:27:01.696 --> 03:27:03.957]  It is done on the basis of illegitimacy.
[03:27:04.197 --> 03:27:06.398]  That's what you said about Donald Trump's presidency.
[03:27:06.678 --> 03:27:08.519]  So you are the chairman of nothing.
[03:27:08.599 --> 03:27:10.380]  We don't recognize your authority.
[03:27:11.140 --> 03:27:21.184]  And to be clear, this country is at total war with collaborators working with offshore corporations, the CHICOMs and others with Hollywood to demoralize and break down this country.
[03:27:21.564 --> 03:27:29.367]  They have publicly, the Democrats and the Hollywood scum like Bill Maher have said, let's plunge the economy to stop Trump.
[03:27:29.427 --> 03:27:30.688]  And now they've raised interest rates.
[03:27:31.048 --> 03:27:32.228]  They brag that they've done it.
[03:27:32.268 --> 03:27:33.629]  They're trying to suppress it further.
[03:27:33.989 --> 03:27:35.870]  The president must start having weekly
[03:27:37.074 --> 03:27:37.395]  Stay tuned.
[03:27:54.338 --> 03:27:55.099]  They've got one.
[03:27:55.159 --> 03:27:56.400]  It's now do or die.
[03:27:56.900 --> 03:28:00.122]  Trump was lied to by his lawyers that he wasn't the target.
[03:28:00.463 --> 03:28:02.825]  And now he knows they're a bunch of double-dealing cowards.
[03:28:03.145 --> 03:28:04.446]  And so he's taking the gloves off.
[03:28:04.746 --> 03:28:08.409]  And Roger, that itself is the really good news, isn't it?
[03:28:09.164 --> 03:28:15.767]  Well, it is, and the President should not allow this media-created myth of Robert Mueller as some kind of saint.
[03:28:16.207 --> 03:28:31.313]  The President should go on national TV and outline Mr. Mueller's involvement in 9-11, his involvement in BCCI, his involvement in Pan Am 103, Lockerbie, his involvement in the anthrax scandal, his involvement with Whitey Bulger,
[03:28:31.873 --> 03:28:37.277]  Uh, and I think the American people- His involvement with the Russians, his involvement with the Saudis, his involvement with everything.
[03:28:37.337 --> 03:28:38.798]  He is Mr. Dirt.
[03:28:39.418 --> 03:28:40.939]  He is Mr. Corruption.
[03:28:41.660 --> 03:28:43.761]  It's- it's- I mean, we didn't even list half the crowd.
[03:28:44.161 --> 03:28:45.742]  You're absolutely right.
[03:28:45.782 --> 03:28:46.803]  There are two keys to this.
[03:28:47.364 --> 03:28:49.405]  ISIL warrants and uranium-1.
[03:28:49.745 --> 03:28:51.386]  Follow the money.
[03:28:51.446 --> 03:28:54.909]  Go on the attack or they will destroy not just Trump but the whole country.
[03:28:55.209 --> 03:28:56.430]  America's fighting for its life.
[03:28:56.470 --> 03:28:57.210]  Trump's our champion.
[03:28:57.450 --> 03:28:58.771]  Roger Stone, God bless you.
[03:28:59.131 --> 03:29:00.172]  Infowars.com.
[03:29:00.192 --> 03:29:01.173]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:29:01.893 --> 03:29:09.636]  Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens.
[03:29:10.336 --> 03:29:10.976]  Translation?
[03:29:11.777 --> 03:29:16.419]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[03:29:16.619 --> 03:29:24.942]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[03:29:24.962 --> 03:29:30.904]  A high rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting house or skipping airport security.
[03:29:31.164 --> 03:29:35.646]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[03:29:46.852 --> 03:29:48.352]  You know Google's really the CIA.
[03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:18.152]  But it's leftist run now, so it's brought over to China, and it's a civil war inside the intelligence agency.
[03:30:18.352 --> 03:30:26.757]  These are serious people plotting to finagle the searches, which is what Google sells to us as being fair and unbiased.
[03:30:26.897 --> 03:30:33.340]  Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any American election just by altering its search suggestions.
[03:30:33.760 --> 03:30:34.701]  We'd never know what happened.
[03:30:34.701 --> 03:30:44.229]  Well, Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:46.051]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:30:46.131 --> 03:30:56.820]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, but it's officially moved its main operations for AI to China and is merging with the Chinese government, letting them have all the technology.
[03:30:57.000 --> 03:31:09.254]  So they're working on behalf of the fascist Chinese government, sending propaganda to its people to keep them under the control of the government, but we shouldn't worry about the fact that they have a chokehold on all human information in English.
[03:31:09.434 --> 03:31:10.015]  Not a big deal.
[03:31:10.736 --> 03:31:12.598]  I mean, that's a lot you just said there, but I...
[03:31:13.899 --> 03:31:21.304]  So Google always swears that its liberal, anti-Trump views of the top people doesn't affect the search product.
[03:31:21.825 --> 03:31:27.268]  But here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activism.
[03:31:27.288 --> 03:31:31.891]  The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily.
[03:31:32.271 --> 03:31:36.234]  They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps.
[03:31:36.634 --> 03:31:42.277]  But the legitimate election of President Trump somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values?
[03:31:42.898 --> 03:31:44.578]  Give me a break.
[03:31:44.819 --> 03:31:47.280]  Google was working to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[03:31:47.420 --> 03:31:58.866]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[03:31:58.986 --> 03:32:02.088]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary Clinton's leaked
[03:32:03.949 --> 03:32:13.797]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[03:32:13.917 --> 03:32:23.204]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[03:32:23.304 --> 03:32:24.405]  Shame on the mainstream!
[03:32:25.265 --> 03:32:36.270]  You're not allowed to get the InfoWars official app on your iPhone.
[03:32:36.290 --> 03:32:41.433]  You're not allowed to watch the Alex Jones Show on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[03:32:42.213 --> 03:32:51.898]  But if you're the Chinese government and you want access to every citizen and all their data and everything they've ever done on an Apple product,
[03:32:52.856 --> 03:32:53.977]  Good to go, baby.
[03:32:54.978 --> 03:32:55.599]  Good to go.
[03:32:56.279 --> 03:32:59.262]  And the left in America loves it.
[03:33:06.169 --> 03:33:08.792]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.188 --> 03:33:29.238]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:33:30.960 --> 03:33:32.301]  Epic times we're all living in.
[03:33:32.682 --> 03:33:34.704]  It's Friday, November 30th, 2018.
[03:33:34.944 --> 03:33:41.390]  This incredibly dangerous, out-of-control year.
[03:33:42.515 --> 03:33:44.256]  Is now almost over.
[03:33:44.416 --> 03:33:47.038]  And can you imagine what's coming in 2019?
[03:33:47.618 --> 03:33:58.425]  A real year of decisions about whether we're going to let the globalist counter-offensive work and take over society or whether all of us are going to really put our heads down and take action.
[03:34:00.666 --> 03:34:01.187]  I want to
[03:34:02.864 --> 03:34:05.845]  For TV viewers especially, but for radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[03:34:05.925 --> 03:34:15.168]  Roll some of the incredible raw footage that our team down on the Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, California, U.S.
[03:34:15.228 --> 03:34:19.189]  border have shot with drones and handheld.
[03:34:19.310 --> 03:34:23.751]  It is unbelievably illustrative of how the U.N.
[03:34:23.851 --> 03:34:32.094]  knowingly brings refugees into nations, builds these horrible open-air camps, creates the crisis of disease and crime
[03:34:33.482 --> 03:34:43.729]  And then demands that the countries then sign treaties giving the UN more money and more power and more control over the very crisis they admit they've engineered.
[03:34:45.871 --> 03:34:52.375]  The answers always give them more money and they pull on our heartstrings when we know that it's all part of a larger program.
[03:34:52.395 --> 03:34:58.920]  And we have interviews that are posted to InfoWars.com where the illegal alien invaders are saying, we were promised everything would be free.
[03:34:58.940 --> 03:35:00.581]  We were promised we'd get right in.
[03:35:00.621 --> 03:35:01.642]  The UN lied to us.
[03:35:03.683 --> 03:35:06.244]  This is how world government conquers nation states.
[03:35:06.324 --> 03:35:13.567]  And right now, they're getting set next week to try to ratify a new global treaty where borders don't even exist.
[03:35:14.007 --> 03:35:22.571]  Even if countries say it does, other nations will gang up against you, like the EU, and will send in their navy to stop you.
[03:35:23.371 --> 03:35:37.534]  So this is 21st century warfare, ladies and gentlemen, with now over 50,000 people marching, or already now, on the border with California and the United States, where if they get through,
[03:35:38.973 --> 03:35:53.785]  Democrat judges will then shove a welfare spoon in their mouth, which the Democrats will then skim money off the top and then put them into labor so they can get money on every level of these people's misery, a new permanent underclass.
[03:35:54.145 --> 03:35:56.147]  This is the globalist program.
[03:35:57.268 --> 03:35:58.028]  It's cut and dry.
[03:35:58.871 --> 03:36:02.153]  And it's all based on squeezing the third world.
[03:36:02.293 --> 03:36:03.894]  Never allowing it to industrialize.
[03:36:04.295 --> 03:36:05.656]  Never allowing it to become free.
[03:36:05.696 --> 03:36:06.296]  That's on record.
[03:36:06.736 --> 03:36:08.057]  IMF and World Bank are on record.
[03:36:08.397 --> 03:36:12.660]  Suppressing the third world and keeping them in corruption squalor as a political tool.
[03:36:13.021 --> 03:36:15.442]  And then you look at the Democrats and the blue cities they control.
[03:36:15.722 --> 03:36:17.083]  They're all third world as well.
[03:36:17.584 --> 03:36:19.525]  Because it's a formulae.
[03:36:20.326 --> 03:36:20.946]  It's a system.
[03:36:22.147 --> 03:36:23.728]  The globalists want to kill you in the womb.
[03:36:24.807 --> 03:36:34.389]  But if they can't, they're gonna then try to kill your brain with vaccines and GMO and cultural brainwashing and confusing your gender if you get out of the womb.
[03:36:35.149 --> 03:36:37.430]  Destabilization, being predatory is their plan.
[03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:45.512]  And our own Owen Schroeder went to the Austin City Council yesterday to point out, on record, that they are illegally
[03:36:46.414 --> 03:36:51.075]  Giving tens of millions of dollars of value to Planned Parenthood just at one facility.
[03:36:51.095 --> 03:36:52.395]  It's happening all over the country.
[03:36:53.175 --> 03:36:56.056]  And then Planned Parenthood gives them political contributions.
[03:36:56.876 --> 03:37:03.438]  And these Democrats were up on the city council stage laughing at him while he talked about babies' hearts being stopped.
[03:37:03.978 --> 03:37:10.719]  This is the sick attitude and behavior of these people and it illustrates how at every level they're feeding on humanity.
[03:37:10.999 --> 03:37:13.340]  Here is Owen Schroeder's powerful report.
[03:37:14.266 --> 03:37:16.267]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[03:37:16.367 --> 03:37:31.773]  I'm in front of the Austin City Council building where I'm set to speak where they have public communications here and I'm going to bring up a big issue of Planned Parenthood getting a government-owned property to rent for $1 a year.
[03:37:31.833 --> 03:37:33.233]  Now this has been going on since 1972.
[03:37:33.453 --> 03:37:33.933]  They just voted
[03:37:36.074 --> 03:37:39.276]  To extend this for up to 40 years.
[03:37:39.776 --> 03:37:41.657]  A major advantage for Planned Parenthood.
[03:37:41.837 --> 03:37:43.318]  But that's not all there is to the story.
[03:37:43.738 --> 03:37:46.440]  So I went to City Council today to raise awareness for this.
[03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:47.820]  I gave them all the facts.
[03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:48.801]  Let's see how it went.
[03:37:50.120 --> 03:37:53.543]  Thank you, Mayor Adler and members of the City Council present today.
[03:37:54.103 --> 03:37:58.466]  Mr. Renteria, last time I saw you, you were illegally campaigning outside of a polling place.
[03:37:58.967 --> 03:38:00.788]  That's not what I'm here to talk about today.
[03:38:01.348 --> 03:38:09.555]  What I'm here to talk about today is a giant pay-for-play scam, at the very least, happening in the state of Texas and Austin.
[03:38:10.095 --> 03:38:16.580]  This month, this City Council voted to once again allow Planned Parenthood to rent government-owned property for free for $1 a year.
[03:38:18.081 --> 03:38:21.384]  This property is valued at a fair market price per year of $110,000.
[03:38:21.444 --> 03:38:27.850]  This property is also about to receive renovations with a price tag of $1.2 million.
[03:38:28.791 --> 03:38:39.380]  This property had a bidder, Austin Life Care, who made a fair market bid to rent the property, and Austin Life Care offers the same services as Planned Parenthood, minus the abortions.
[03:38:39.901 --> 03:38:41.762]  That bid was ignored.
[03:38:42.563 --> 03:38:51.088]  Now, Planned Parenthood has been receiving this advantage since 1972, and thanks to this city council that could go on for another 40 years.
[03:38:51.628 --> 03:38:56.631]  So it is fair to say that this Planned Parenthood clinic is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
[03:38:56.992 --> 03:39:07.258]  This on top of the millions of taxpayer dollars Planned Parenthood receives a year, half a billion this calendar year, one and a half billion over the last three years, yet this clinic needs free rent?
[03:39:08.478 --> 03:39:25.151]  Before I ask the City Council to justify this decision which goes against millions of Texans' spiritual, religious, and political beliefs, I will point out what to me is criminal pay-for-play activity happening between the Democrats, some of which are on the City Council, mind you, you identify as Democrats, and Planned Parenthood.
[03:39:25.831 --> 03:39:33.820]  In 2018, according to FEC filings and open secrets reports, the following Texas Democrats in Congress received campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood.
[03:39:33.840 --> 03:39:36.843]  So if this is untrue, I'm waiting to hear these Democrats disavow it.
[03:39:48.155 --> 03:39:51.119]  Or, I think this requires I file a federal complaint.
[03:39:51.619 --> 03:39:59.348]  How can any entity that receives government money be contributing to campaigns specifically to only one party?
[03:39:59.428 --> 03:40:01.911]  So, not to mention the millions of hearts
[03:40:03.012 --> 03:40:06.314]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[03:40:37.353 --> 03:40:37.694]  Laughing.
[03:40:37.974 --> 03:40:39.474]  And that's funny to Mr. Renteria.
[03:40:40.274 --> 03:40:43.495]  Do you realize that Planned Parenthood has admitted that they stopped beating hearts?
[03:40:44.336 --> 03:40:45.216]  And we're gonna fund that?
[03:40:46.636 --> 03:40:48.437]  So there's no comment from this City Council.
[03:40:48.697 --> 03:40:51.298]  Mayor Adler, can you justify that decision for the City of Austin?
[03:40:54.179 --> 03:40:54.739]  That's your time.
[03:40:54.979 --> 03:40:55.339]  Thank you.
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:40:57.420]  Next speaker.
[03:41:01.169 --> 03:41:05.353]  Mr. Clinton, and then after Mr. Clinton, Mr. Leon.
[03:41:05.613 --> 03:41:08.696]  Now the full report, there's more, is up on Infowars.com.
[03:41:08.796 --> 03:41:09.137]  Get it.
[03:41:09.897 --> 03:41:12.400]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[03:41:13.621 --> 03:41:14.662]  Lawsuits need to be filed.
[03:41:14.682 --> 03:41:15.563]  This is all illegal.
[03:41:15.943 --> 03:41:17.545]  See, conservatives and Christians don't do it.
[03:41:17.785 --> 03:41:20.107]  There's more than one way to stop these death facilities.
[03:41:21.869 --> 03:41:22.469]  You sue them.
[03:41:22.669 --> 03:41:24.831]  In fact, you know what?
[03:41:25.874 --> 03:41:27.776]  I'm a taxpayer in here in Austin.
[03:41:28.456 --> 03:41:29.737]  Maybe I should file that lawsuit.
[03:41:30.378 --> 03:41:39.165]  But it takes money to do that, and that's why we need your financial support and FortWorthStore.com with this weekend being the last days of the Cyber Week sales.
[03:41:39.705 --> 03:41:41.987]  We'll have sales continuing through Christmas, but these are our biggest ever.
[03:41:42.007 --> 03:41:43.849]  A lot of stuff's selling out, so take advantage of those.
[03:41:44.289 --> 03:41:53.471]  Speaking of our children, here's just a few days ago in Lafayette, Louisiana, a man who dresses like a woman who wants to come talk to your kids, saying, I'm there grooming your children.
[03:41:53.711 --> 03:41:55.931]  This is the stuff going on in city councils all over the country.
[03:41:56.492 --> 03:41:58.912]  He wants to groom your children about LGBT.
[03:41:59.212 --> 03:42:03.713]  Imagine if a heterosexual man wanted to go to your school and groom your daughters about heterosexual sex.
[03:42:04.173 --> 03:42:06.474]  He keeps saying, it's disgusting that you don't want us to do this.
[03:42:06.834 --> 03:42:10.335]  No, you being obsessed with our children is disgusting!
[03:42:10.515 --> 03:42:11.275]  You monster!
[03:42:11.455 --> 03:42:11.915]  Here he is!
[03:42:12.756 --> 03:42:15.940]  I just want to let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful.
[03:42:16.280 --> 03:42:21.727]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[03:42:22.007 --> 03:42:26.652]  We are trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did.
[03:42:27.213 --> 03:42:28.935]  You're going to come talk to our kids about sex.
[03:42:29.236 --> 03:42:29.376]  What?
[03:42:30.848 --> 03:42:32.489]  What an over-the-top obviousness of this.
[03:42:32.509 --> 03:42:34.370]  By the way, I want to show you something.
[03:42:34.390 --> 03:42:35.291]  Here's David Knight's notes.
[03:42:35.331 --> 03:42:36.511]  He's about to take over live here.
[03:42:37.432 --> 03:42:39.293]  This is the type of notes he does for each show.
[03:42:40.254 --> 03:42:41.274]  Look at these amazing topics.
[03:42:41.294 --> 03:42:44.816]  David Knight's taking over today, the rest of Friday broadcast, a bunch of huge guests.
[03:42:45.357 --> 03:42:46.878]  Climate change or geoengineering?
[03:42:47.718 --> 03:42:54.003]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[03:42:54.083 --> 03:42:55.865]  And as we prepare to close out 2018,
[03:43:16.861 --> 03:43:25.205]  Isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[03:43:26.225 --> 03:43:32.928]  Or to say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man, well that's dead naming.
[03:43:33.169 --> 03:43:41.212]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[03:43:41.572 --> 03:43:44.734]  Then they say it's racist to say no, that it's okay to be white.
[03:43:45.094 --> 03:43:47.875]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation or borders.
[03:43:48.295 --> 03:43:50.956]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told, is evil.
[03:43:51.436 --> 03:43:55.057]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[03:43:55.937 --> 03:43:57.877]  World War III was the Cold War.
[03:43:59.238 --> 03:44:00.958]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[03:44:01.338 --> 03:44:07.240]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others,
[03:44:08.666 --> 03:44:27.023]  With the America-hating Hollywood crowd literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left because the globalists are threatened by first world nations, they're threatened by the middle class, they're threatened by the uppity-ness
[03:44:28.436 --> 03:44:29.697]  Of free market capitalism.
[03:44:30.278 --> 03:44:34.321]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[03:44:35.042 --> 03:44:36.663]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[03:44:37.123 --> 03:44:39.846]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[03:44:40.926 --> 03:44:42.248]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[03:44:42.328 --> 03:44:46.551]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[03:44:47.092 --> 03:44:49.854]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[03:44:51.391 --> 03:44:57.455]  But the globalists are counter-striking against independent patriot nationalist media like InfoWars.
[03:44:57.475 --> 03:45:02.898]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective thanks to your support.
[03:45:03.738 --> 03:45:04.739]  You have been the most effective.
[03:45:06.176 --> 03:45:07.417]  Exposing what's really happening.
[03:45:08.018 --> 03:45:12.321]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[03:45:12.421 --> 03:45:20.888]  I wanted to thank you for all of your support and I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[03:45:22.109 --> 03:45:23.230]  And without you, we won't be here.
[03:45:23.850 --> 03:45:27.852]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[03:45:29.032 --> 03:45:31.373]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:31.853 --> 03:45:40.597]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[03:45:40.617 --> 03:45:43.358]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[03:45:43.818 --> 03:45:44.579]  We're good to go.
[03:46:10.259 --> 03:46:26.925]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding Infowars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[03:46:27.405 --> 03:46:38.669]  And you are provisioning and funding not just the second American Revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:40.570]  Forced sterilization.
[03:46:40.930 --> 03:46:42.230]  Children being sterilized.
[03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:45.671]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[03:46:45.791 --> 03:46:49.533]  And Infowars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[03:46:49.833 --> 03:46:52.154]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[03:46:52.414 --> 03:46:53.894]  And we will fight until the end.
[03:46:54.334 --> 03:46:56.615]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[03:46:56.655 --> 03:46:58.776]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[03:46:59.196 --> 03:47:00.357]  And thank you all for your support.
[03:47:00.557 --> 03:47:00.997]  God bless you.
[03:47:06.162 --> 03:47:08.796]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.726 --> 03:47:19.790]  Anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, but especially historians are very, very clear on something.
[03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:31.697]  Fairy tales from all over the world, whether it's from ancient Germany, or ancient Japan, or ancient what is now Latin America, Mesoamerica, the Aztecs, are all very, very similar.
[03:47:32.277 --> 03:47:33.398]  They're archetypal.
[03:47:33.478 --> 03:47:39.701]  And Carl Jung wrote about the hero of a thousand faces, or the villain of a thousand faces.
[03:47:41.482 --> 03:47:45.183]  What I'm about to break down is extremely profound and extremely serious.
[03:47:45.203 --> 03:47:48.083]  And if you understand this, you understand the whole world.
[03:47:49.424 --> 03:47:54.225]  Because you understand the appetite of the globalists and the cult we're facing.
[03:47:55.305 --> 03:48:01.606]  Every culture, when it went into decadent cycles, engaged in human sacrifice, particularly of children.
[03:48:02.606 --> 03:48:09.508]  Ancient Druids, ancient Babylonians, ancient Israelites, ancient Mesoamericans, every culture did it.
[03:48:09.808 --> 03:48:10.288]  It's on record!
[03:48:11.107 --> 03:48:16.651]  They built pyramids, altars, they burned children, they ate them, they drank their blood, they burned them.
[03:48:18.112 --> 03:48:22.515]  And now, in modern age, we see an obsession with aborting children.
[03:48:23.015 --> 03:48:26.478]  And abortion doctors getting busted admitting that they were carrying out rituals while they did it.
[03:48:27.238 --> 03:48:38.286]  We see all these movements of the LGBT community, NAMBLA, saying, we want to come talk to your children about diversity, and we admit that we are actually grooming them.
[03:48:39.006 --> 03:48:43.431]  And I am not here to obviously change anyone's views about me.
[03:48:43.932 --> 03:48:47.456]  But I'm here to let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful.
[03:48:47.796 --> 03:48:53.182]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[03:48:55.077 --> 03:48:56.217]  And then it really hit me.
[03:48:56.277 --> 03:49:00.858]  If you look at all of the Western famous fairy tales from the Greeks and the Germans and the British and others,
[03:49:18.533 --> 03:49:27.940]  They're all about evil, corrupt witches, or warlocks, coming and trying to steal the voice of the Little Mermaid, her innocence, her soul.
[03:49:28.921 --> 03:49:36.167]  It's Rumpelstiltskin, the little dwarf goblin, giving the woman what she wants, but he gets the firstborn child.
[03:49:36.767 --> 03:49:40.690]  It's Hansel and Gretel, getting captured and being fattened up by the witch to be eaten.
[03:49:41.311 --> 03:49:47.256]  It's Snow White, where the evil queen believes if she kills her, she gets her essence and will be the most beautiful again.
[03:49:47.956 --> 03:49:55.441]  It's Rapunzel, the princess stolen up in a high tower with the witch living forever off the essence of the young one.
[03:49:56.442 --> 03:50:03.206]  But the one that really brings it into clear, crisp, 2020 focus is Little Red Riding Hood.
[03:50:03.746 --> 03:50:10.771]  Everyone knows Little Red Riding Hood is a way to tell children about real dangers, but in a story format that they'll listen.
[03:50:11.877 --> 03:50:18.821]  If you tell children, hey, there's a bad man out there that might try to kidnap you when you're outside and, you know, go take you and rape you and kill you, kids won't tune in.
[03:50:19.022 --> 03:50:19.602]  They won't listen.
[03:50:20.262 --> 03:50:33.250]  But if you tell them a story about the big bad wolf that followed a little girl home and then went in and ate grandma and then dressed up like her, like a little old lady, so that she would come close so that she couldn't get away.
[03:50:33.331 --> 03:50:34.591]  My, what big eyes you have.
[03:50:34.651 --> 03:50:36.352]  My, what big sharp teeth you have.
[03:50:36.433 --> 03:50:38.094]  All the better to eat you with, my dear.
[03:50:39.150 --> 03:50:42.371]  And you think about it, then you pull back from Europe to the U.S.
[03:50:42.491 --> 03:50:44.052]  Drag queen days.
[03:50:44.352 --> 03:50:45.352]  They're not even drag queens.
[03:50:45.372 --> 03:50:47.793]  It's not like Bob Hope dressed up like a woman to be funny.
[03:50:49.133 --> 03:50:49.314]  No.
[03:50:50.254 --> 03:51:03.438]  It's men dressing up in these scary, weird outfits and coming in and traumatizing and talk to mainly elementary students, five, six year olds, about their sexuality and just how you shake your booty and you can be a boy, you can be a girl.
[03:51:04.019 --> 03:51:07.700]  Things parents would never say to their kids is done out in the open and it's a man
[03:51:09.173 --> 03:51:14.979]  Dressed like a woman, but then there's even the archetype with so many of the ways they dress actually scary on top of it.
[03:51:15.679 --> 03:51:21.405]  So they're throwing it in everyone's face what's going on, even admitting this is grooming people into a way of life.
[03:51:21.986 --> 03:51:23.787]  And in many cases they don't even warn the schools.
[03:51:24.548 --> 03:51:27.810]  Or the parents, they just show up at the events at career day.
[03:51:28.331 --> 03:51:30.633]  In other cases, the schools don't tell the parents.
[03:51:31.073 --> 03:51:33.735]  So everything about this is diabolical and it's evil.
[03:51:34.135 --> 03:51:40.740]  Because throughout every time in history, there is an obsession with taking control of the youth and their energy.
[03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:44.423]  It is a form of psychic and energetic vampirism.
[03:51:45.043 --> 03:51:48.524]  And it's the essence of Luciferianism, Satan worship.
[03:51:48.584 --> 03:51:49.864]  It's come out in the Catholic Church.
[03:51:50.244 --> 03:51:51.264]  It's been taken over by this.
[03:51:51.604 --> 03:51:53.685]  Them raping children in mass in rituals.
[03:51:54.465 --> 03:51:56.125]  It's all over the world.
[03:51:56.145 --> 03:52:01.926]  They're seeing a major resurgence of what's happened during this part of the end of the cycle.
[03:52:01.966 --> 03:52:04.947]  The end of the decadent cycle going back into rebirth.
[03:52:05.307 --> 03:52:08.868]  We're seeing this true evil rear its head again that's in the history books.
[03:52:09.488 --> 03:52:34.424]  That's in the fairy tales, that's in all the archetypes, that's in all the horror movies, but it's going on right in front of you and the media is telling you that if you stand against it and say that it's abusive to sexualize five-year-olds, if you say it's abusive to not tell parents men are gonna dress like women, like the big bad wolf, this old lady, to come speak with your children, to make that first contact, to groom them, if you say that two plus two equals four, the media will attack you.
[03:52:35.433 --> 03:52:36.593]  I'm not afraid of the corporate media.
[03:52:36.613 --> 03:52:37.574]  They've signed on to pure evil.
[03:52:38.654 --> 03:52:43.195]  But I do know some people out there are aware of this and decided to go ahead and go along with it because they're afraid of being ridiculed.
[03:52:43.875 --> 03:52:48.356]  You've now signed on to the abuse and traumatization of these children by not taking action.
[03:52:48.856 --> 03:52:53.017]  So I'm challenging everyone who's been on the fence to stand up and start speaking out against this.
[03:52:53.397 --> 03:52:59.819]  Because the fact that they're trying to ban anybody from the internet that decries this shows how it's organized, how it's diabolical,
[03:53:01.682 --> 03:53:04.815]  And how it's so outrageous, you can't...
[03:53:05.882 --> 03:53:14.447]  Cement itself, it can't get a firm beachhead if we, as guardians of the children, and of culture, and of innocence, stand up and say, you will not pass.
[03:53:14.887 --> 03:53:17.708]  Like Gandalf at that bridge with the bulrog coming.
[03:53:18.129 --> 03:53:21.350]  The bulrog's just an archetype of the raw spirit of destruction.
[03:53:22.051 --> 03:53:28.654]  And that's the spirit behind these little clowns that they're dangling out in front to the children.
[03:53:29.095 --> 03:53:34.498]  But that clown is only the light on the angler fish and the real darkness lurking.
[03:53:35.678 --> 03:53:39.165]  We must defend our children or we must side with Satan.
[03:53:39.646 --> 03:53:41.249]  The choice is up to you.
[03:53:42.190 --> 03:53:46.558]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:53:49.335 --> 03:53:54.359]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:53:54.799 --> 03:54:03.186]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[03:54:03.346 --> 03:54:14.675]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[03:54:14.795 --> 03:54:16.317]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[03:54:17.117 --> 03:54:33.004]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[03:54:33.064 --> 03:54:35.325]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:54:35.785 --> 03:54:42.168]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:46.935]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:54:47.516 --> 03:54:52.688]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:54:58.573 --> 03:55:07.516]  I have promoted and sold hundreds of great products in my 22 years on air, but this one right here is in the top three.
[03:55:07.916 --> 03:55:09.077]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:55:09.357 --> 03:55:13.038]  You can buy filters similar to this one for $500 to $600 that are three-stage.
[03:55:17.189 --> 03:55:36.150]  Alexa Pure Breeze is $200, has a four filter system, including ion, cluster, charcoal, and more, that is completely game-changing, and costs less than half of leading competitors.
[03:55:37.031 --> 03:55:38.452]  And when you look at the specs,
[03:55:39.508 --> 03:55:40.369]  It's just amazing.
[03:55:40.509 --> 03:55:49.254]  When you first turn it on in a room, it's red, meaning it's picking up particulate, it's picking up pathogens, it's picking up gases, it's picking up toxins.
[03:55:49.634 --> 03:55:55.678]  And it might take 10 minutes, it might take an hour for it to turn pink and then blue when it's picking nothing up.
[03:55:55.738 --> 03:55:56.718]  And these are so strong.
[03:55:57.079 --> 03:55:59.960]  In my home, if I sneeze 20 feet away,
[03:56:01.361 --> 03:56:03.964]  In a few seconds, it goes from blue to red.
[03:56:04.324 --> 03:56:05.666]  It's picking up that particulate.
[03:56:06.206 --> 03:56:15.076]  That's what's so amazing about this unit is the sensors are so strong and the four filtration systems are so compact but so powerful.
[03:56:15.196 --> 03:56:18.519]  Could you spend way more and get something that maybe has a little bit better specs?
[03:56:18.579 --> 03:56:18.779]  Yes.
[03:56:19.400 --> 03:56:24.543]  But there are a lot of filters out there that are $500, $600, $700 that aren't even as good.
[03:56:24.843 --> 03:56:28.625]  And again, these can go six months to a year depending on how dirty the environment is.
[03:56:29.085 --> 03:56:31.427]  The replacement filters are very, very inexpensive.
[03:56:31.927 --> 03:56:39.491]  Do yourself a favor and go to InfowarsStore.com today, read the specs for yourself, and then you have nothing to lose.
[03:56:39.891 --> 03:56:40.171]  Spend $200.
[03:56:41.412 --> 03:56:44.033]  Help us make $50 to fund our operation.
[03:56:44.374 --> 03:56:46.515]  Get an amazing unit in your home.
[03:56:46.795 --> 03:56:54.258]  I'm very confident that we're gonna see you come back and order several more and then a few more for your office and then to give them as gifts as well.
[03:56:54.538 --> 03:56:57.620]  There are studies, and listen to me carefully, all over the world
[03:56:58.607 --> 03:57:11.616]  And depending on the study, it's between 7 and 12 years that the average person loses off their life expectancy living in a big city alone because of the toxins and the particulates.
[03:57:11.916 --> 03:57:14.258]  You then add all the pollen and the rest of it.
[03:57:15.238 --> 03:57:23.284]  It is not a luxury to have the Alexa Pure Breeze that is the best filtration system out there at the lowest price.
[03:57:24.345 --> 03:57:25.826]  It is essential.
[03:57:27.262 --> 03:57:33.325]  We are doing everything we can to mitigate the toxic environment that industrial society has created.
[03:57:33.565 --> 03:57:34.746]  So support the InfoWarp.
[03:57:35.186 --> 03:57:37.907]  Fund folks that are fighting the globalists and having success.

[03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:45.631]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze at InfoWarpStore.com.
[03:57:45.851 --> 03:57:51.073]  We also have their full line of amazing gravity-fed filters as well, which are a huge home run.
[03:57:51.373 --> 03:57:51.734]  But this...
[03:57:53.013 --> 03:57:58.120]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[03:58:00.467 --> 03:58:02.028]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[03:58:02.068 --> 03:58:02.669]  It's a good thing.
[03:58:02.709 --> 03:58:05.912]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:58:06.472 --> 03:58:08.894]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[03:58:08.914 --> 03:58:09.995]  I learned what the best was.
[03:58:10.675 --> 03:58:23.926]  An Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[03:58:24.427 --> 03:58:29.391]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[03:58:29.571 --> 03:58:34.016]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[03:58:34.516 --> 03:58:36.879]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[03:58:37.559 --> 03:58:41.944]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[03:58:43.596 --> 03:58:45.298]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:58:46.060 --> 03:58:48.343]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[03:58:48.363 --> 03:58:54.992]  That's when you get the best deals on cars is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[03:58:55.012 --> 03:58:57.355]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[03:58:57.435 --> 03:58:57.855]  And that's not
