[00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:09.750]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:20.080]  Yesterday, Anderson Cooper kicked off his brand new Facebook livestream, which he's going to be doing five days a week, which Facebook is paying CNN to produce.
[00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:22.542]  Let's take a look and see how it went.
[00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:24.435]  Now, as I said, remarkable.
[00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.998]  It didn't take long for Democrats to chastise President Trump, probably no surprise there.
[00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.584]  Some Republicans also condemned the President, most notably Senator John McCain, said in a statement, I want to read part of it to you.
[00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:49.118]  You may be wondering what that noise is in the background, and it's actually an audio track that they played throughout the entire broadcast, trying to be like some cool, hip, millennial YouTube vlogger, which plays annoying background music during their entire YouTube video.
[00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:51.520]  Later in the show, he was joined by Jim Acosta.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.626]  And as you can see by the live viewer count here, they didn't even have 5,000 people tuning into the stream.
[00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:08.495]  And look at this, they're formatting the show vertically for mobile devices because apparently their audience doesn't know that you can turn your phone sideways and expand it full screen when you're watching media.
[00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:13.901]  Later in the stream, Anderson decided to answer some audience questions to make the show interactive.
[00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:18.766]  And by that time, the viewership had dropped down to under 4,000 people.
[00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:23.512]  What story did you do that had a long-lasting effect on you personally?
[00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:33.617]  I mean, there's been so many places I've been that have really been life-changing and eye-opening and mind-bending and, you know, you see a lot of people.
[00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:38.539]  And the greatest satisfaction I get from the job is... Is making $11 million a year.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.363]  Or, if you break it down per episode, with five episodes a week, that's over $45,000 per show!
[00:01:45.623 --> 00:01:53.327]  Oh, and speaking of money, Facebook is reportedly paying CNN $5 to $10 million a year to produce this new five-day-a-week
[00:01:53.587 --> 00:01:55.649]  Let's do the math on that, shall we?
[00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.791]  That's $5 million divided by 12 months, divided by 4 weeks, divided by 5 shows a week.
[00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:02.854]  That's $20,833.33 per episode of his streaming show, which capped out at about 6,000 viewers.
[00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:30.078]  His show was such a failure that by the end of the 30-minute livestream, they actually hid the number of viewers, and then it just showed the little red live button without the viewer count!
[00:02:30.258 --> 00:02:34.563]  And here he is later on CNN begging people to tune in to his new Facebook show!
[00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:39.986]  Today we were proud to kick off something new, a live interactive daily newscast on Facebook.
[00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:41.086]  It's called Full Circle.
[00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:49.449]  On it, you'll see great interviews with the day's biggest newsmakers, a quick look at the day's hottest stories online, as well, stories that you yourself decide on.
[00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.010]  We've been working hard getting it ready, incorporating your feedback.
[00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.410]  It's a really interactive broadcast.
[00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.551]  We're trying to make it as special and different as possible.
[00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:59.972]  You can access it at facebook.com slash Anderson Cooper Full Circle.
[00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:00.793]  That's one word.
[00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:03.493]  Discover what tens of thousands of followers already have.
[00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:04.434]  We'll see you there.
[00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:07.779]  No you won't, because nobody's watching.
[00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:15.221]  Anderson was so disappointed in President Trump's press conference with Vladimir Putin yesterday, that as soon as it finished, he had this to say.
[00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:22.564]  You have been watching perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president at a summit in front of a Russian leader.
[00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:25.365]  It's the only that I've ever seen.
[00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.586]  An extraordinary press conference.
[00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:33.248]  I'm back with CNN Global Affairs analyst Susan Glasser, CNN Senior Political Analyst David.
[00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:38.229]  Gee, I wonder why you can't even get 5,000 people to watch your new Facebook show, Anderson.
[00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:46.997]  Of course, with the liberal media creating new Trump-Putin conspiracy theories almost every day, seeing the two of them standing next to each other was just more than they could bear.
[00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:58.708]  Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's trying to be a YouTuber now, posted a rant on his official YouTube channel, in portrait mode, of course, with two giant black bars on the side of it, which got a whopping 12,000 views.
[00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.872]  President Trump, I just saw your press conference with President Putin, and it was embarrassing.
[00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:10.496]  I mean, you stood there like a little wet noodle, like a little fanboy.
[00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:14.899]  I mean, I was asking myself, when are you going to ask him for an autograph or for a selfie or something like that?
[00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:22.324]  I mean, you've literally sold out this press conference, our intelligence community, our justice system, and worst of all, our country.
[00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:25.106]  You're the President of the United States, you shouldn't do that.
[00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:26.947]  And what's the matter with you?
[00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:32.728]  I'm sorry, Arnold, but shouldn't you be taking care of your illegitimate son that you had with your Mexican maid?
[00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:43.737]  Liberals got so bent out of shape over Trump's press conference with Putin that former CIA operative and current CNN contributor Phil Mudd called for the shadow government to take over the country.
[00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.339]  Curious point in American government.
[00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:51.524]  When do we see almost a shadow government come out and say, we cannot side with the government, whether it's the cabinet or the Senate?
[00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:52.525]  I think that's the big question.
[00:04:52.705 --> 00:04:56.479]  But frankly, you're literally calling for a deep state coup.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.663]  By the way, yesterday's
[00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:03.745]  Living in-
[00:05:34.048 --> 00:05:37.751]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[00:06:07.231 --> 00:06:08.552]  Coming at you live!
[00:06:12.796 --> 00:06:14.758]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:06:15.078 --> 00:06:16.900]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.781]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:42.306]  We have forced the enemy out in the open.
[00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:52.090]  MSNBC, CNN, ABC News, Forbes, ABC News Australia, the BBC, The London Guardian, Gerspiegel.
[00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.332]  There's over a thousand articles a day.
[00:06:58.392 --> 00:06:59.853]  Local TV, radio.
[00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:22.892]  Beyond that, lying and demonizing Infowars, and yours truly Alex Jones, and calling for us to be shut down, calling for us to be banned, calling for us to be removed, and then building straw men, lying about what we've said and done, to then try to set the precedent for everybody else.
[00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:26.375]  And just as night follows day, and day follows night,
[00:07:27.495 --> 00:07:36.264]  No sooner had they put strikes on my YouTube and Facebook accounts and blocked us on most of the accounts from live streaming that's a very small part of our audience.
[00:07:38.046 --> 00:07:39.848]  But for CNN, it's a giant audience.
[00:07:39.868 --> 00:07:40.648]  They're very jealous of it.
[00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:41.649]  I'll get to that in a minute.
[00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:54.349]  Anderson Cooper's total failure with 4,000 viewers on his new Facebook show that they paid $18 million for and that is force-fed and pushed notifications to tens of millions of people.
[00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:58.352]  They shadow ban us and our videos have hundreds of thousands or millions of views.
[00:07:59.553 --> 00:08:06.560]  They force-feed Anderson Cooper and he had 4,000 viewers in the entire show.
[00:08:08.717 --> 00:08:11.299]  That's, by the way, in the newspapers today.
[00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.280]  It's very, very embarrassing for them.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.202]  That's why I led in that little first segment.
[00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:18.044]  If you just tuned in with Mark Dice, breaking it all down.
[00:08:18.084 --> 00:08:20.926]  I mean, Mark Dice's average video used to have 5 million views.
[00:08:21.647 --> 00:08:23.468]  They were so jealous of him, they shadow banned him.
[00:08:23.488 --> 00:08:24.889]  So now, you know, he has a half million views.
[00:08:25.429 --> 00:08:29.032]  Doesn't matter, he just does more and is, you know, proliferating in other areas.
[00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:33.856]  So, this is the craziness of all of this.
[00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:36.458]  These people are total jokes.
[00:08:36.498 --> 00:08:37.979]  So now Anderson Cooper,
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.162]  And Acosta that was on with him.
[00:08:42.662 --> 00:08:52.590]  They now do these things in studios like they're outside with a vertical video and you hear car noises and music and stuff in the background like he's really out on the street.
[00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.671]  And I sort of noticed this a few weeks ago.
[00:08:54.731 --> 00:09:00.556]  Cooper does feeds now on CNN where it's not an external mic, it's a internal mic.
[00:09:00.936 --> 00:09:04.198]  So it's really bad audio and they're doing it on purpose.
[00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:07.140]  They think it's the low quality that makes people watch.
[00:09:07.221 --> 00:09:07.361]  No!
[00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:12.821]  People want to watch other people that they think are independent.
[00:09:13.722 --> 00:09:16.444]  They'd rather watch independent people on a slick platform.
[00:09:17.704 --> 00:09:19.265]  But they do not want to watch you.
[00:09:19.285 --> 00:09:26.750]  Look, you could put fudge icing on a dog turd.
[00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:29.874]  But once somebody bites into it, they're going to spit it out.
[00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:31.756]  You can go, oh no, I'm putting more fudge on.
[00:09:31.776 --> 00:09:37.039]  No amount of hot fudge on the dog dropping is going to make people eat it.
[00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:39.621]  And CNN is beyond a dog dropping.
[00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:40.901]  It's beyond fake news.
[00:09:41.342 --> 00:09:44.484]  I sent them a letter today on notice for tortious interference.
[00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:49.287]  And I don't just file lawsuits to file them.
[00:09:49.367 --> 00:09:50.287]  I file them if I can win them 100%.
[00:09:53.854 --> 00:10:12.858]  They are on television saying, take me off the air, and then lying about what I said, and then calling publishers and getting publisher people fired, because I'm working on a book with one of the top-selling authors who's alive, Neil Strauss, The War for the Future.
[00:10:13.938 --> 00:10:15.898]  Secret history of the world in The War for the Future.
[00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:17.938]  That isn't a book that sells 10 million.
[00:10:17.978 --> 00:10:18.419]  What doesn't?
[00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:20.459]  Everybody knows it's the super hit.
[00:10:21.658 --> 00:10:24.899]  Of course, after you try to ban it, then we'll, of course, publish it ourselves.
[00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.679]  We already knew you'd all do this.
[00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:28.319]  You just walked right into our trap, as usual.
[00:10:28.359 --> 00:10:31.420]  But the point is, is that you're still very, very dangerous.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:44.363]  Because you may not have any viewers, but you've got a huge army of leftist foundation operatives, SJWs, intelligence operatives, at CNN, at MSNBC, and that is the deep state.
[00:10:45.623 --> 00:10:50.904]  CNN is the tip of the iceberg, but it's the visible part of the deep state, and under
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.565]  What you see on the surface, with Anderson Cooper and the rest of them, is the enemy.
[00:10:58.606 --> 00:11:00.388]  And that's why President Trump has called them the enemy.
[00:11:00.448 --> 00:11:01.989]  But they're the ones calling for violence.
[00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.072]  They're the ones out trying to restrict everybody's speech.
[00:11:07.094 --> 00:11:14.101]  Ahead, ahead, this is critical, of
[00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:23.085]  The midterms to suppress our speech so that we're not able to speak out or show you video of what really happens at Antifa events or leftists attacking people.
[00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:32.510]  I've got so many riveting videos today, but we're having to bleep them, of leftists attacking people all over the country.
[00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:39.574]  If they see you in an American flag shirt, if they see you in a Trump hat, if they see you in a Make America Great Again shirt,
[00:11:40.413 --> 00:11:48.896]  I mean, you're talking about a group of racially charged Hispanics in California at the destroyed star, Hollywood star of Donald Trump.
[00:11:52.216 --> 00:12:11.054]  Believing the propaganda of CNN and all the race war stuff, attacking Joy Vila, who is Hispanic, by the way, and a couple of white dudes, Marine Corps veterans, that are just out there to exercise their free speech, but even 15 gangbangers couldn't beat up the two white dudes.
[00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:14.297]  Now, that's because they're punks.
[00:12:16.758 --> 00:12:25.625]  It's absolutely pathetic to see how the Democratic Party is trying to turn Hispanics, Blacks, Whites, you name it, into leftist KKK members to go out and attack people.
[00:12:25.905 --> 00:12:27.426]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:30.028]  So they don't want all this being reported.
[00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:38.835]  That the literal modern brownshirts are taking control of the streets, CNN, MSNBC are putting out lies to Congress,
[00:12:40.543 --> 00:12:42.283]  Trying to legitimize why they're banning people.
[00:12:42.504 --> 00:12:44.464]  They're shadow banning most members of Congress.
[00:12:45.084 --> 00:12:47.185]  It's going on and on and on.
[00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:58.528]  To where now in Los Angeles, many Hispanic Americans believe any white person that supports Trump deserves to be physically attacked 15 to 1 because they're a Nazi.
[00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:10.327]  There's also footage of a black reporter and a white reporter just out calmly asking SJWs at a pro-Maxine Waters rally about what's going on.
[00:13:11.688 --> 00:13:19.475]  And I know about this particular show, one guy's a liberal actually, they're just pro-free speech, and they get chased and attacked screaming N-word at the black reporter.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.823]  Just like you see the videos coming out that if we show it, they say we're racially insensitive.
[00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:37.114]  National News can show the Border Patrol and ICE and police, you know, that are out at these events and occupy this, occupy that, and then they run up to the black cops, white people, and scream, inward, inward, inward.
[00:13:38.613 --> 00:13:43.818]  And then if we point it out, they take down our videos saying we called somebody an N-word.
[00:13:44.118 --> 00:13:44.598]  Did you hear?
[00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:46.480]  Jones had a video taken down for N-word.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.421]  Yeah, showing you saying it.
[00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:54.226]  But see, since they take the video down, you don't even know what's going on.
[00:13:57.389 --> 00:14:01.412]  Just like they said it was on local radio, it was on local TV.
[00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:03.374]  I guess KVUE did it.
[00:14:04.537 --> 00:14:09.198]  And I've got cousins calling me in East Texas going, yeah, we heard on the news you beat up a child.
[00:14:10.138 --> 00:14:10.979]  Was that one of your kids?
[00:14:11.239 --> 00:14:12.099]  They wouldn't show the video.
[00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:14.900]  And I said, no, that was Missouri.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.701]  And it was a kid beating up adults.
[00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:19.781]  And one guy pushed him down.
[00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:21.021]  It was on ABC News.
[00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:21.581]  I showed it.
[00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:26.943]  And then the news went, wait, we can say that's child endangerment, take the video down, just say child endangerment.
[00:14:27.203 --> 00:14:28.423]  Forbes said I beat a kid up.
[00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:31.484]  And there's now filings.
[00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:39.722]  At the Travis County Courthouse, people are down there trying to do TROs to take my kids, and they're holding up the article.
[00:14:40.142 --> 00:14:42.304]  And the news locally won't say it's not true.
[00:14:42.684 --> 00:14:48.890]  They are actively on the news saying, well, we can't get into it because of children's privacy, but Jones beat up a child.
[00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.574]  And my phone's ringing, and I got family going, are you okay?
[00:14:52.594 --> 00:14:53.535]  Did you really beat up a child?
[00:14:53.575 --> 00:14:55.317]  I'm like, no, it's psych warfare.
[00:14:55.337 --> 00:14:57.559]  They're about to... And here's the key to everything.
[00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:04.424]  They wouldn't be doing all this, because this is so discrediting to them, if they weren't planning a total takeover soon.
[00:15:04.944 --> 00:15:14.413]  They're launching, as I said, towards the end of summer, early fall, in their own admissions, a massive civil unrest situation to bring in a national emergency and CNN's own comments.
[00:15:19.157 --> 00:15:21.359]  So, that's what's happening.
[00:15:22.899 --> 00:15:32.366]  And even Facebook put out a statement saying, we reviewed CNN's complaint calling for InfoWars to be shut down, and he did not say they were crisis actors or that no one died.
[00:15:33.026 --> 00:15:34.387]  And CNN doesn't even know what to do.
[00:15:34.447 --> 00:15:37.650]  I'll show you screenshots of the Twitter of Facebook saying that.
[00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.591]  So here's the deal.
[00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:41.032]  It's a lot bigger than InfoWars.
[00:15:41.372 --> 00:15:42.413]  They're making their move.
[00:15:42.453 --> 00:15:43.874]  The globalists are counter-striking.
[00:15:44.254 --> 00:15:46.176]  Hollywood owned by the Chi-Coms is doing that.
[00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:49.238]  It's incredible.
[00:15:50.719 --> 00:15:52.060]  It is unbelievable.
[00:15:53.192 --> 00:15:54.434]  They're going for broke.
[00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:55.875]  They're about to make their big move.
[00:15:55.915 --> 00:15:57.017]  Everybody watch your six.
[00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.418]  Don't let them intimidate you.
[00:15:58.438 --> 00:15:59.359]  Just keep getting the word out.
[00:15:59.399 --> 00:15:59.820]  We're winning.
[00:16:02.205 --> 00:16:06.007]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:16:06.347 --> 00:16:12.991]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:16:13.451 --> 00:16:18.034]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[00:16:18.294 --> 00:16:25.218]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system

[00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:05.854]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force!
[00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:06.395]  Go ahead.
[00:17:06.615 --> 00:17:12.218]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[00:17:12.418 --> 00:17:13.498]  I'd done The War Room.
[00:17:13.818 --> 00:17:16.480]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.840]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.561]  I was exhausted.
[00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:22.102]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:27.085]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[00:17:27.165 --> 00:17:29.026]  Tonight I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[00:17:29.046 --> 00:17:29.746]  The same thing.
[00:17:29.906 --> 00:17:32.007]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[00:17:32.107 --> 00:17:33.328]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[00:17:33.488 --> 00:17:35.590]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:41.113]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling.
[00:17:41.274 --> 00:17:42.675]  You know, you can sleep with it.
[00:17:43.035 --> 00:17:47.358]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[00:17:47.418 --> 00:17:50.220]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.061]  This is the best combination I have found.
[00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:52.881]  It really works.
[00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:57.685]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[00:17:58.065 --> 00:17:59.726]  I wasted a lot of money on old boots.
[00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:00.286]  Believe me.
[00:18:06.447 --> 00:18:13.968]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:27.551]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:32.513]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[00:18:32.814 --> 00:18:36.936]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:39.278]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:58.080]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling!
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:58.981]  InfoWars.
[00:18:59.361 --> 00:19:00.242]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:19:00.563 --> 00:19:00.883]  Today.
[00:19:01.664 --> 00:19:08.930]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:16.876]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:19:17.236 --> 00:19:20.339]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:25.223]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:19:25.603 --> 00:19:29.526]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:19:29.726 --> 00:19:32.468]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:37.172]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:19:37.652 --> 00:19:40.675]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:19:41.115 --> 00:19:55.945]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:19:56.185 --> 00:19:57.466]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:19:57.706 --> 00:20:00.168]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:08.994]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:35.692]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:36.952 --> 00:20:43.437]  So, CNN has been on national news lying about Infowars, lying about everything else that's pro-America, and they've been caught.
[00:20:44.733 --> 00:20:53.884]  And Facebook said no, he didn't say nobody died at Parkland and uh... So they went ahead and moved on then to saying that I beat up a kid.
[00:20:55.827 --> 00:20:56.848]  And Forbes did it as well.
[00:20:58.366 --> 00:21:02.971]  And now that's the national headline without even looking for my name.
[00:21:03.031 --> 00:21:08.276]  I go to like Yahoo, CNN, it's like, Alex Jones blocked on YouTube for child endangerment.
[00:21:08.477 --> 00:21:09.938]  Child shoved to the ground.
[00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:12.801]  We won't show you the graphic video of what happened to the child.
[00:21:13.302 --> 00:21:16.465]  And everybody just goes, that's next level defamation.
[00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:19.028]  Because Forbes said I beat a kid up.
[00:21:19.068 --> 00:21:20.189]  The others just leave it out there.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.321]  So people call me, they go, what happened to the kid?
[00:21:23.341 --> 00:21:24.082]  Who was the kid?
[00:21:24.422 --> 00:21:26.623]  You know, we don't think you'd attack a child, Alex.
[00:21:26.683 --> 00:21:27.664]  And I go, no, I didn't.
[00:21:27.684 --> 00:21:28.244]  It's fake news.
[00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:31.706]  And they go, they go, they're that bad now?
[00:21:32.727 --> 00:21:34.328]  Wow, this country really is in trouble.
[00:21:36.345 --> 00:21:40.027]  Now, Tucker Carlson is under big-time attack because he pointed out the obvious.
[00:21:40.427 --> 00:21:52.473]  They've had Jim Acosta and his producer and all this fake news at CNN constantly in the face of Trump during everybody else's questions, you name it, during the press conferences, just dominating him.
[00:21:56.687 --> 00:22:03.252]  The producer for one of the CNN shows, that used to be the producer for Tucker Carlson when he was there, she got blocked for the week.
[00:22:03.673 --> 00:22:06.535]  Now, they already have thousands that want to get in, only a few hundred get in.
[00:22:07.195 --> 00:22:10.698]  So it's normal, but CNN always just expects it's in there.
[00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:12.760]  So they didn't get their week pass coming up.
[00:22:13.945 --> 00:22:16.626]  So, oh, Ryan Skelter's up there.
[00:22:17.326 --> 00:22:19.087]  Oh, it's so horrible for First Amendment.
[00:22:19.127 --> 00:22:20.347]  The President's trying to destroy it.
[00:22:20.927 --> 00:22:25.629]  Meanwhile, he comes back next segment and brags we're very close to banning Alex Jones and shutting down his speech.
[00:22:26.349 --> 00:22:30.971]  That's how they don't think there's any logic or memory going on here.
[00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:33.832]  So here is Tucker Carlson.
[00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:47.480]  Who, by the way, the Democrats are in the news now calling for him to be deplatformed and a bunch of other conservatives, like Stephen Crowder and Stefan Molyneux, because they know what's happening.
[00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:51.302]  They know they're losing.
[00:22:51.823 --> 00:22:52.883]  And so they misrepresent.
[00:22:53.003 --> 00:23:00.388]  And Newsweek, CNN, they go, Tucker Carlson defends Alex Jones, bullying the Parkland students and saying no one died.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.641]  And Pucker Carlson defends child endangerment.
[00:23:05.422 --> 00:23:07.303]  All hoaxes, all lies.
[00:23:08.424 --> 00:23:14.567]  Just like they say every hour on the hour, Trump hates Hispanics and says they're all rapists and criminals.
[00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:21.250]  So then everybody shows up at the Trump star that's been pickaxed.
[00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:31.196]  And you beat up the white people because, well, they're obviously bad, I mean,
[00:23:32.281 --> 00:23:33.862]  Donald Trump means Heil Hitler, right?
[00:23:35.384 --> 00:23:36.525]  That's the brainwashing.
[00:23:36.885 --> 00:23:37.826]  That footage is coming up.
[00:23:37.906 --> 00:23:50.056]  That's where they're trying to take this country, totally divided by the media and the globalists and the Chinese government that oppresses their own people, openly manipulating it, trying to stop our government getting control of our country again.
[00:23:50.357 --> 00:23:52.539]  America has been captured by foreign interests.
[00:23:52.819 --> 00:23:53.239]  Period.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.962]  And they're using weaponized garbage to do it.
[00:23:56.502 --> 00:24:01.610]  And Tucker Carlson points this out in another piece that Brian Stelter said is hateful and needs to be removed.
[00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.496]  So see, once they start policing InfoWars, it's everybody.
[00:24:06.923 --> 00:24:09.544]  Just like they started shadow banning members of Congress last week.
[00:24:10.164 --> 00:24:11.464]  Just like I told them that was coming.
[00:24:11.724 --> 00:24:14.885]  And now people are awake because they're going too far, too fast.
[00:24:15.285 --> 00:24:16.206]  Because they're desperate.
[00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:17.326]  Because the midterms are coming.
[00:24:17.346 --> 00:24:19.167]  Because the blue wave is going to fail, they believe.
[00:24:19.467 --> 00:24:20.427]  And I believe it will as well.
[00:24:20.847 --> 00:24:21.867]  Unless there's election fraud.
[00:24:22.147 --> 00:24:23.468]  And so they don't know what to do.
[00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:24.148]  They're scared.
[00:24:24.188 --> 00:24:25.428]  They've been caught doing all this stuff.
[00:24:25.748 --> 00:24:27.149]  So now they're going to go for broke.
[00:24:27.189 --> 00:24:30.770]  Here is Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:24:31.783 --> 00:24:38.446]  The big story in Washington today is that Kaitlan Collins over at CNN was prevented from covering an event at the White House yesterday.
[00:24:38.506 --> 00:24:39.987]  Kaitlan worked for me for years.
[00:24:40.347 --> 00:24:44.529]  She's a fair and decent person and I don't think she should have been prevented from covering anything.
[00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:45.650]  That's my position.
[00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.292]  But CNN has been basically a martyr for free speech for the last 24 hours.
[00:24:50.072 --> 00:24:55.194]  At the same time, they're telling us how important it is that people should be able to say what they think.
[00:24:55.654 --> 00:24:59.235]  They are agitating for Alex Jones to be pulled off YouTube.
[00:24:59.275 --> 00:25:09.498]  Now, I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than, like, Bill Maher, Michelle Wolf, or Rosie O'Donnell, but he's got a point of view, and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[00:25:09.538 --> 00:25:10.318]  What do you make of that?
[00:25:10.618 --> 00:25:15.143]  Yeah, you know, I'm all in favor of CNN getting all the access that it wants to the White House.
[00:25:15.404 --> 00:25:19.188]  I want all reporters to get all the access that they want at the White House.
[00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:19.508]  Me too.
[00:25:19.528 --> 00:25:23.132]  But you're right, the hypocrisy is just astounding.
[00:25:23.393 --> 00:25:28.839]  And I guarantee you that if you flipped over to CNN right now, there would not be a single story about the Twitter shadow banning.
[00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.000]  There would not be a single story.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:44.553]  And the only story you would see about YouTube pulling Alex Jones videos would be probably something celebratory about a scalp of sorts for managing to eventually get their way on that story.
[00:25:46.255 --> 00:25:55.823]  I look at all of the consternation about Donald Trump and this White House, but you know, my goodness, this has been going on for absolutely ever.
[00:25:56.303 --> 00:25:58.886]  You know how the White House press shop works.
[00:25:59.526 --> 00:26:06.332]  At press conferences, the president always picks who he wants to ask him questions.
[00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:10.516]  Often the staffers go around and talk to the reporter beforehand.
[00:26:10.856 --> 00:26:12.157]  As far as I'm concerned, it's the same.
[00:26:12.858 --> 00:26:16.781]  So, CNN, MSNBC, the Democratic Party, they all call for me to be banned for months.
[00:26:42.554 --> 00:26:52.680]  And then Facebook and YouTube catch CNN and a bunch of lies, but then they say, well, we can objectively then just kind of make up that you've done something here.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.181]  We'll go ahead and ban Alex Jones on this.
[00:26:54.461 --> 00:26:54.901]  And here it is.
[00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:56.422]  Facebook suspends personal profile.
[00:26:56.683 --> 00:26:57.923]  VinfoWars founder Alex Jones.
[00:26:58.023 --> 00:26:59.904]  CNN celebrating right now.
[00:27:02.266 --> 00:27:03.767]  They say he bullied a child.
[00:27:07.089 --> 00:27:08.750]  I showed ABC News footage.
[00:27:10.768 --> 00:27:11.969]  See, they won't show you the footage.
[00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:16.932]  Paul Watson has an article up on Infowars.com that shows the four banned videos.
[00:27:17.392 --> 00:27:19.073]  But that's not even what's important.
[00:27:20.494 --> 00:27:30.700]  The live streaming on those platforms, that one has two million followers, then doesn't let us broadcast, that's what they call it, it's a transmission, to people.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:39.145]  So CNN is effectively having its victory as tortuous interference in the market, lying, having an ad campaign, a hoax,
[00:27:40.407 --> 00:27:49.891]  To then bully corporations into setting the precedent to restrict me so they can then expand that to everyone else, which then I've got the stacks of articles coming up.
[00:27:51.292 --> 00:28:04.057]  They're having big international TV conventions right now, two of them, where they're calling for Fox News to be de-platformed and the Republican Party and countless Republican congressmen and women can't even post now to their Facebooks or Twitters and their shadow ban.
[00:28:04.437 --> 00:28:06.358]  Shadow ban has been going on five years.
[00:28:09.346 --> 00:28:15.010]  They've ratcheted up from 50% to 90% of conservative posts being blocked.
[00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.471]  You could say, man, I really like President Trump.
[00:28:18.192 --> 00:28:18.972]  You can't do that.
[00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:23.435]  So they act like, oh, we're just banning Alex Jones, and they're not.
[00:28:23.896 --> 00:28:24.536]  So it's here.
[00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:29.039]  It's exponential censorship ahead of the midterms and ahead of civil unrest they want to start.
[00:28:29.379 --> 00:28:30.360]  That's why this is critical.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.101]  But here's the good news.
[00:28:31.561 --> 00:28:38.846]  You, the listeners and viewers of this show, every color creed, red-blooded humans that I love, you,
[00:28:39.913 --> 00:28:42.375]  Expose this, and now shadow ban is a household term.
[00:28:42.655 --> 00:28:44.196]  People now know how they're being censored.
[00:28:44.216 --> 00:28:44.937]  They're getting together.
[00:28:45.177 --> 00:28:47.379]  They're realizing it, and that's why Facebook's plunging.
[00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:48.900]  That's why the globalists are in trouble.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.903]  So now they're going to accelerate their plan towards total censorship in desperation.
[00:28:53.243 --> 00:28:56.666]  That will only detonate their downfall that much quicker.
[00:28:57.127 --> 00:28:59.308]  But Tucker Carlson knocked it out of the park again.
[00:28:59.328 --> 00:29:00.849]  I'm going to play that when we come back.
[00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:01.330]  Stay with us.
[00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:06.449]  Super silver wound gel uses silver salt technology.
[00:29:06.749 --> 00:29:10.172]  There's been extensive research on silver salt technology.
[00:29:10.533 --> 00:29:19.922]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity
[00:29:20.562 --> 00:29:20.943]  ...study.
[00:29:21.243 --> 00:29:23.987]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[00:29:24.348 --> 00:29:29.315]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:31.738]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:29:31.998 --> 00:29:36.665]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:29:36.685 --> 00:29:37.266]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:41.449]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[00:29:41.689 --> 00:29:44.351]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[00:29:44.611 --> 00:29:47.913]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[00:29:48.294 --> 00:29:53.597]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[00:29:53.677 --> 00:29:57.820]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[00:29:58.681 --> 00:30:01.363]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[00:30:02.558 --> 00:30:06.142]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:30:06.542 --> 00:30:08.985]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[00:30:09.285 --> 00:30:13.650]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.972]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[00:31:06.352 --> 00:31:06.612]  Go ahead.
[00:31:06.872 --> 00:31:12.436]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[00:31:12.636 --> 00:31:13.737]  I'd done the War Room.
[00:31:14.057 --> 00:31:16.498]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[00:31:16.518 --> 00:31:18.079]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[00:31:18.119 --> 00:31:18.760]  I was exhausted.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.342]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[00:31:22.682 --> 00:31:27.325]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[00:31:27.405 --> 00:31:29.426]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[00:31:29.586 --> 00:31:30.267]  Uh, same thing.
[00:31:30.347 --> 00:31:31.067]  I'm gonna put in a full
[00:31:31.067 --> 00:31:32.128]  All day here at Infowars.
[00:31:32.168 --> 00:31:33.549]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[00:31:33.729 --> 00:31:35.831]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:41.415]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling.
[00:31:41.515 --> 00:31:41.836]  You know?
[00:31:42.136 --> 00:31:42.997]  You can sleep with it.
[00:31:43.277 --> 00:31:47.600]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.463]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[00:31:50.603 --> 00:31:52.304]  This is the best combination I have found.
[00:31:52.424 --> 00:31:53.125]  It really works.
[00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:57.929]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[00:31:58.309 --> 00:32:00.010]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods.
[00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.451]  Believe me.
[00:32:02.614 --> 00:32:10.603]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.

[00:32:59.726 --> 00:33:01.889]  Now available at mfulwardslife.com.
[00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:10.424]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.715 --> 00:33:28.477]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:33.001]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:37.807 --> 00:33:46.530]  By the way, I've always said on air that if I found somebody more effective than me, and more on target, that I would point that person out.
[00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:50.051]  Not that I'm that good, but my strong points were very strong.
[00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:52.312]  Tucker Carlson is that person.
[00:33:52.972 --> 00:33:53.832]  There's no doubt.
[00:33:53.932 --> 00:34:05.396]  So, if the media picks up on my particular love fest, I love my children, I love the truth, and Carlson, the way he lays it out and the way he's hit his stride is,
[00:34:06.816 --> 00:34:10.237]  I mean, it's about as close to perfection there is.
[00:34:10.337 --> 00:34:16.699]  Obviously he has his moments and nobody's perfect, but it's like... He's hitting about a 99 here.
[00:34:17.439 --> 00:34:21.381]  And that's why Stelter and all these no-talent kookballs want him off the air.
[00:34:22.121 --> 00:34:25.162]  Because he points out what they've said and what they've done.
[00:34:25.222 --> 00:34:29.303]  Not like Stelter saying, Jones bullied a small child and beat him up.
[00:34:29.363 --> 00:34:30.464]  He's been taken off YouTube.
[00:34:30.664 --> 00:34:31.304]  Total lie!
[00:34:31.904 --> 00:34:33.084]  Doesn't matter if Forbes said it.
[00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:34.985]  Doesn't matter if you get Facebook to agree to it.
[00:34:38.951 --> 00:34:41.012]  When Carlson talks about something, he shows it.
[00:34:41.032 --> 00:34:49.156]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see it, but I'm showing Forbes and others retracting that I wasn't in Missouri a month ago.
[00:34:49.216 --> 00:34:51.277]  I didn't beat up some kid that was punching me in the face.
[00:34:51.317 --> 00:34:52.358]  The guy didn't even look like me.
[00:34:52.438 --> 00:35:01.482]  But right now, we can't stream on YouTube or my main Facebook account because YouTube was lobbied by CNN.
[00:35:01.522 --> 00:35:03.083]  CNN says they lobbied for this.
[00:35:03.663 --> 00:35:05.784]  And again, why would CNN
[00:35:07.375 --> 00:35:09.497]  Be spending all its time and all its energy doing this.
[00:35:11.979 --> 00:35:12.979]  Because they're globalists.
[00:35:12.999 --> 00:35:14.581]  They work for multinational corporations.
[00:35:14.621 --> 00:35:15.782]  They work for the Communist Chinese.
[00:35:16.202 --> 00:35:17.703]  Americans aren't an afterthought.
[00:35:17.963 --> 00:35:22.267]  If Carlson isn't going all the way because his audience isn't ready yet, don't know.
[00:35:23.107 --> 00:35:25.269]  Americans are the enemy of CNN.
[00:35:25.549 --> 00:35:26.390]  Just as Trump has said.
[00:35:28.638 --> 00:35:31.159]  And they're globalists, and that's their model, and that's their plan.
[00:35:31.559 --> 00:35:33.020]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.561]  And then I've got all the clips.
[00:35:35.061 --> 00:35:36.742]  When I say all the clips, there's so much cussing.
[00:35:36.822 --> 00:35:38.783]  It takes the crew hours to bleep it all.
[00:35:39.083 --> 00:35:41.924]  For like five minutes of video, you've got to bleep like 80 times.
[00:35:41.944 --> 00:35:44.045]  It's just a beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:35:45.906 --> 00:35:49.168]  And we're on broadcast TV and stuff, so we've got to cover up people flipping folks off.
[00:35:49.208 --> 00:35:49.848]  We have to do all that.
[00:35:51.585 --> 00:35:55.828]  And it is Democrats just beating people up everywhere.
[00:35:55.908 --> 00:35:57.529]  It's just exponentially increasing.
[00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.610]  So it's a huge deal.
[00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:08.718]  But also at the start of the next segment, I'm going to read to you on air my letter officially to CNN, putting them on notice of lawsuit.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.222]  And of course, you notice when I sue people, it's not in the news.
[00:36:15.538 --> 00:36:17.279]  But I've countersued a bunch of folks.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.881]  A lot of lawsuits have been dropped.
[00:36:19.701 --> 00:36:21.903]  But that takes a lot of money to finance what we're doing.
[00:36:21.983 --> 00:36:23.104]  This is a war.
[00:36:23.384 --> 00:36:30.049]  You think we're going to take America back from the Chai-coms and the globalists and the big banks and Hollywood that literally has mounted America's head to the wall?
[00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:39.376]  Do you think these people that in their own private recordings call you flyover country and bitter clingers and say how much they hate you on Bill Maher and all these shows?
[00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:42.299]  Do you think it's going to be easy to take it all back from them?
[00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:42.459]  No.
[00:36:44.355 --> 00:36:51.923]  It's certainly not going to be easy for those of us on the front line, but I'll tell you, it's a lot better than living under their scumbag control, so I'm very honored to be part of this contest of liberty.
[00:36:52.343 --> 00:36:53.024]  It's very animating.
[00:36:54.846 --> 00:36:55.887]  So I'll play the Tucker Club.
[00:36:57.645 --> 00:37:00.947]  That Stelter says is hateful and un-American and, you know, once censored.
[00:37:01.348 --> 00:37:02.648]  And people say, why do you focus on Stelter?
[00:37:02.669 --> 00:37:03.909]  He has like 100,000 viewers.
[00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.030]  He's a total joke.
[00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:09.013]  But he's the mouthpiece of the establishment.
[00:37:09.053 --> 00:37:10.654]  So you're hearing from them.
[00:37:10.714 --> 00:37:18.740]  When you hear that, that monster, that anti-free speech defiler, that deceiver, he is the mouth of the enemy.
[00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:22.282]  So we're going to get to that here in just a moment.
[00:37:23.223 --> 00:37:23.503]  First,
[00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:29.584]  If it isn't clear now, it'll never be clear.
[00:37:29.824 --> 00:37:39.172]  That if you want to truly be part of the Second American Revolution, and if you really want to be part of the zeitgeist, everyone listening should buy a shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:37:39.572 --> 00:37:43.656]  That finances what we're doing, our fight against the globalists, our continued operations.
[00:37:45.461 --> 00:37:46.402]  It spreads the word.
[00:37:46.462 --> 00:37:49.023]  You can get them all on Lobby, where you just meet fellow patriots.
[00:37:49.383 --> 00:37:54.406]  Or if you want to wear a Trump 2020 shirt, or reelect 45, and go into a blue area, you might get killed.
[00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:57.527]  But, I mean, it's choose your own adventure.
[00:37:57.567 --> 00:37:59.088]  We have hundreds of amazing shirts.
[00:37:59.648 --> 00:38:08.113]  From shirts I designed 20-something years ago, like Mass Murderers Agree, Gun Control Works, Politicians Love Disarmed Peasants, to the new M4 Wars logo shirt and Army Green.
[00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:11.154]  We got Made in America shirts.
[00:38:11.175 --> 00:38:12.375]  We got Made in Mexico shirts.
[00:38:12.555 --> 00:38:13.696]  It's all there for you to choose from.
[00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:18.732]  It's at Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[00:38:18.913 --> 00:38:26.217]  And, you know, a lot of people claim they want America to continue and they claim that they, you know, well, if I ever see UN troops, I'll go to war.
[00:38:26.677 --> 00:38:28.498]  Listen, we already kicked the UN troops out.
[00:38:28.538 --> 00:38:30.680]  We already took the country back at the federal level, partially.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:37.424]  This is an info war to silence the patriots and cause civil insurrection to bring in a crisis to then bring in the UN.
[00:38:39.045 --> 00:38:44.108]  Which is officially in the Strong Cities Initiative that Obama tried to launch with Loretta Lynch three months before he left office.
[00:38:45.842 --> 00:38:51.447]  If you won't get involved politically now in the streets, in information warfare, you'll never get involved.
[00:38:52.628 --> 00:38:56.671]  If we fail in these defensive steps to try to save things peacefully.
[00:38:57.312 --> 00:39:11.123]  And I'm not bitching at the listeners and viewers, I love you, but the power of you wearing these shirts in public, the power of you downloading the free iPhone and Droid app, InfoWars.com, forward slash app, the new official app, much better than the last app, it's excellent.
[00:39:12.544 --> 00:39:13.125]  The power
[00:39:14.679 --> 00:39:16.400]  Of you spreading the word and taking action.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.121]  The power of you telling your office, hey, you ever hear these bad things about Alex Jones?
[00:39:20.161 --> 00:39:20.901]  Yeah, it's all over.
[00:39:21.321 --> 00:39:21.782]  Who is he?
[00:39:22.402 --> 00:39:24.002]  Is he the guy that beat up a little kid the other day?
[00:39:24.623 --> 00:39:25.043]  Well, no.
[00:39:25.583 --> 00:39:26.343]  Actually, it's not true.
[00:39:26.403 --> 00:39:27.864]  Here, hear from him yourself.
[00:39:27.984 --> 00:39:28.504]  Find out.
[00:39:30.665 --> 00:39:31.825]  Doesn't everybody want to know?
[00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:35.587]  The thing that everybody's so afraid of?
[00:39:35.607 --> 00:39:36.867]  Oh, by the way, look at that new one.
[00:39:37.127 --> 00:39:37.927]  That shirt's brand new.
[00:39:38.188 --> 00:39:39.148]  Go to George Washington, please.
[00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:42.620]  It's right there.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.041]  Click on that.
[00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:43.581]  George Washington.
[00:39:44.122 --> 00:39:49.886]  That is put together by one of the former leaders of SEAL Team 6, who runs a big t-shirt company.
[00:39:49.906 --> 00:39:50.587]  He's a big patriot.
[00:39:50.867 --> 00:39:54.950]  That was already their bestseller, and he let me put that out.
[00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:58.092]  So, I'm not going to say his name.
[00:39:58.152 --> 00:39:59.474]  He doesn't want his name shown there, obviously.
[00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:03.161]  And show them the back.
[00:40:03.261 --> 00:40:04.402]  That is an awesome shirt.
[00:40:04.422 --> 00:40:05.543]  That's the real George Washington.
[00:40:05.823 --> 00:40:06.984]  Not the old George Washington.
[00:40:07.124 --> 00:40:09.346]  Nothing bad that he was old, but that's the young George Washington.
[00:40:09.786 --> 00:40:12.749]  You know, the 50-year-old French-India War George Washington.
[00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.132]  And it says, Infowars.com with the original 13.
[00:40:16.192 --> 00:40:20.555]  That is an out-of-the-park shirt that everybody should order.
[00:40:20.615 --> 00:40:21.336]  It's amazing.
[00:40:21.436 --> 00:40:22.156]  It's $19.95.
[00:40:22.457 --> 00:40:27.661]  With the fabric and the printing and textures and everything, we're not making much money on that because it's an expensive shirt to make.
[00:40:28.341 --> 00:40:29.062]  They're all there.
[00:40:29.142 --> 00:40:30.123]  Infowars.com.
[00:40:30.183 --> 00:40:31.424]  If you don't get them, you're insane.
[00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:38.197]  If you don't, I mean literally, I'm here frontline battling, winning, fighting, getting attacked, and I'm not bitching.
[00:40:38.237 --> 00:40:39.339]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:40:39.379 --> 00:40:44.827]  But when you just commit, and buy the products, and then meet like-minded people, it's a whole new world you get involved in.
[00:40:44.847 --> 00:40:45.488]  It's a whole new adventure.
[00:40:45.749 --> 00:40:46.270]  Now that said...
[00:40:48.988 --> 00:40:55.194]  We have come out with two-month supplies of, from our research and the top studies and testing, the cleanest fish oil.
[00:40:55.214 --> 00:40:57.356]  Because fish oil is magic, as everybody knows.
[00:40:57.376 --> 00:40:58.997]  It's so good for the heart, the brain, the body, the skin.
[00:40:59.277 --> 00:41:01.119]  But if you get it from big fish, it's got a lot of mercury in it.
[00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:01.639]  It's not good for you.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.182]  Well, this has got the mercury extracted out of it.
[00:41:05.419 --> 00:41:08.600]  And because the krill oil is the easiest to do because it's so small, it doesn't bioaccumulate.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.100]  Amazing.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:17.122]  We've got the ultimate fish oil, targeted release fish oil, so it actually goes into your intestines, doesn't get burned up in your gut, in your stomach.
[00:41:17.502 --> 00:41:18.482]  And ultimate fish oil.
[00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:21.163]  Now, Honor Roll is also over here.
[00:41:21.483 --> 00:41:22.383]  This is for your kids.
[00:41:22.723 --> 00:41:26.664]  This is all the known fish oils that are good for the brain, targeting that.
[00:41:26.744 --> 00:41:28.004]  So it's amazing.
[00:41:28.524 --> 00:41:29.744]  Go look at what it does for yourself.
[00:41:29.784 --> 00:41:31.725]  But let me just show TV viewers.
[00:41:32.912 --> 00:41:36.314]  You can go study fish oil and learn about the ones that really matter, but this.
[00:41:36.774 --> 00:41:38.435]  See, when they're yellow, they've been denatured.
[00:41:39.195 --> 00:41:41.156]  When they're peach, pink, orange.
[00:41:43.917 --> 00:41:48.520]  In fact, a lot of companies will actually dye or have colored gelatin caps to make it have that color.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.000]  No, this is clear gelatin.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:50.681]  This is
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:59.604]  I mean, it took us, again, years to actually know that we were putting out the strongest, purest fish oil there is.
[00:42:00.004 --> 00:42:01.045]  And this is on a roll.
[00:42:01.865 --> 00:42:10.750]  This is a whole big spectrum of the known omega-3s and DHA and EPA and vitamin D and E. So it gets uploaded.
[00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:13.391]  This, for your children, is unbelievable.
[00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:15.552]  It's a child-sized cap, but there's no filler.
[00:42:16.052 --> 00:42:16.853]  It's concentrated.
[00:42:17.153 --> 00:42:18.333]  And let me tell you something.
[00:42:18.353 --> 00:42:19.074]  When I want energy,
[00:42:20.606 --> 00:42:26.908]  When I want stamina, when I am down from working 18 hours, man, I can do this right here.
[00:42:26.928 --> 00:42:29.349]  Especially these children's ones.
[00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:30.069]  These are so good.
[00:42:30.089 --> 00:42:32.510]  Because I went and tried to outdo a leading competitor.
[00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.170]  I've been giving my children this for years.
[00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.371]  Oop, that's rolling over there.
[00:42:36.451 --> 00:42:39.192]  I've been doing this for years, but now we've got ours.
[00:42:39.272 --> 00:42:40.092]  And just look at that.
[00:42:40.152 --> 00:42:40.912]  Nobody's got that.
[00:42:41.092 --> 00:42:42.473]  Nobody's got that vibrancy.
[00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:44.672]  Yeah, he funds the operation.
[00:42:44.692 --> 00:42:45.853]  It fuels your brain, your body.
[00:42:46.213 --> 00:42:47.394]  It's so good for you and your family.
[00:42:47.854 --> 00:42:49.655]  Honor Roll, Ultimate Fish Oil, Ultimate Krill Oil.
[00:42:49.755 --> 00:42:50.756]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:51.116 --> 00:42:55.899]  They're 25% off right now, out of the gates, and your funding is absolutely critical to this war.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.160]  Total win-win.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.461]  Get these little jewels for yourself.
[00:43:02.904 --> 00:43:09.448]  Not only is the president looking to take away Brendan's security clearance, he's also looking into the clearances of
[00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:13.503]  Comey, Clapper, Hayden, Rice, and McCabe.
[00:43:13.844 --> 00:43:23.070]  The president is exploring the mechanisms to remove security clearance because they've politicized and in some cases monetized their public service and security clearances.
[00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:39.361]  Making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the president is extremely inappropriate and the fact that people with security clearances are making these baseless charges provides inappropriate legitimacy to accusations with zero evidence.
[00:43:40.121 --> 00:43:46.483]  President Trump's response to the corrupt globalist deep state is equivalent to what they're doing.
[00:43:47.223 --> 00:43:48.524]  They're calling him a traitor.
[00:43:48.564 --> 00:43:54.505]  They're saying remove him from office for meeting with Vladimir Putin publicly when Hillary met with him illegally and secretly.
[00:43:55.186 --> 00:43:57.966]  They're saying he needs to be overthrown all over the news.
[00:43:58.006 --> 00:44:03.288]  They're circulating it in government publications and white papers that are public.
[00:44:04.168 --> 00:44:07.569]  And then Trump comes out and says, we'll pull your security clearances.
[00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.010]  John Brennan,
[00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.651]  Clapper and others.
[00:44:12.512 --> 00:44:14.173]  Because you can't be trusted.
[00:44:14.253 --> 00:44:15.434]  You're anti-American.
[00:44:15.454 --> 00:44:20.357]  You're totally partisan, working against the election of our last president.
[00:44:21.318 --> 00:44:23.359]  You are working as seditious operatives.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:34.046]  And if you look at people like John Brennan, in college and then out of college, he was on the Communist Party, voted for the Communist Party, and bragged about it to the New Yorker magazine and other publications.
[00:44:34.306 --> 00:44:35.767]  But Snopes says it's not true.
[00:44:36.148 --> 00:44:37.589]  Go look it up for yourself.
[00:44:38.529 --> 00:44:41.993]  Then Brennan joined the most radical form of Islam, a Wahhabist.
[00:44:42.473 --> 00:44:44.675]  Of course Obama put this radical in.
[00:44:45.276 --> 00:44:52.222]  And it was Brennan, and it was Clapper, and it was Rice and others who illegally spied on Trump from 2015 on.
[00:44:52.603 --> 00:45:00.510]  It's all come out now that they were illegally spying without warrants and then they did the famous system of parallel construction.
[00:45:01.531 --> 00:45:11.265]  ...to go back and get warrants on false info, and now their whole criminal cabal that makes Richard Nixon look like a choir boy is all starting to calm down.
[00:45:11.285 --> 00:45:13.367]  And that's why they're at their most dangerous point right now.
[00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:16.251]  And they're saying, how dare you say you'll pull our security clearances?
[00:45:16.452 --> 00:45:17.753]  Oh, by the way, we don't need them.
[00:45:18.414 --> 00:45:27.384]  Oh, they need them so that moles in the government that are still there can give them classified info, which they can then parlay and sell with these lucrative jobs they've got.
[00:45:27.684 --> 00:45:36.353]  And then they can spin the info, leak the president's agenda, spin it, and then derail it and sabotage it, like the Korean peace deal and so many other issues.
[00:45:36.393 --> 00:45:38.375]  They're openly rooting to crash the economy.
[00:45:39.076 --> 00:45:41.477]  On Bill Maher's show and others, they are the enemies.
[00:45:41.837 --> 00:45:42.697]  They hate America.
[00:45:43.077 --> 00:45:47.118]  They're the coastal elites that absolutely hate the people on the east and west coast as well.
[00:45:47.498 --> 00:45:48.578]  They are the traitors.
[00:45:48.618 --> 00:45:49.359]  They are the plague.
[00:45:49.679 --> 00:45:55.260]  And finally, Trump is awake and taking action and getting aggressive and pointing out these people cannot be trusted.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:46:03.142]  It is the standard first move you make to cut off the deep state that is working for multinational corporations, the communist Chinese and others.
[00:46:03.582 --> 00:46:09.686]  They are the enemy, they have stood in the way of American prosperity and peace and security, and now they're in deep trouble and they know it.
[00:46:09.746 --> 00:46:12.128]  So I salute President Trump for what he's done.
[00:46:12.148 --> 00:46:20.093]  I want to just remind the listeners that you heard all of this a year and a half ago here first, about the illegal FISA warrants, about the deep state spying.
[00:46:20.454 --> 00:46:27.238]  We got demonized because we have the sources, we have the research, we have the understanding of the globalist model, and we know how to defeat it.
[00:46:27.258 --> 00:46:27.959]  So whatever you do,
[00:46:28.439 --> 00:46:28.499]  Yes.
[00:46:47.423 --> 00:46:47.843]  We're winning.
[00:46:48.203 --> 00:46:54.865]  And whatever you do, download the new free official InfoWars app at InfoWars.com forward slash app and tell everybody you know to download it as well.
[00:46:55.005 --> 00:47:02.186]  It's the best way to get new people to tune into the show and find out what's so verboten, what's so forbidden that the whole deep state hates us.
[00:47:05.747 --> 00:47:08.387]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.671 --> 00:47:31.179]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:39.249 --> 00:47:52.161]  You know, I didn't even cover this yesterday, but on Monday I said that the Iranian National Guard and Hezbollah, their force around the world, would launch terror attacks during a war with the U.S.
[00:47:52.582 --> 00:47:54.964]  All over the Western world, they have sleeper cells inside the U.S.
[00:47:55.384 --> 00:48:01.090]  That's actually standard Iranian doctrine, a known fact, not in public circles, but classified, but from my own research.
[00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:05.131]  The head of their military said that they have sleeper cells inside the U.S.
[00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:07.832]  and will attack us during a war yesterday.
[00:48:08.772 --> 00:48:09.873]  Next week's news today.
[00:48:11.473 --> 00:48:13.314]  But how about next month's news today?
[00:48:13.934 --> 00:48:14.554]  Can we pull it up?
[00:48:15.694 --> 00:48:19.495]  Now it took us about five minutes during the break because Google buries all of our results.
[00:48:20.456 --> 00:48:27.618]  But back on June 7th, a month and a half ago, I said, according to our White House sources,
[00:48:31.732 --> 00:48:32.953]  And that's a CNBC article.
[00:48:33.193 --> 00:48:36.376]  I said, according to our White House sources, we're going to find it.
[00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:42.561]  Since Google broke their search engine, it drives me crazy that I even tweeted it.
[00:48:43.262 --> 00:48:44.283]  I even Facebooked it.
[00:48:44.363 --> 00:48:45.624]  I did videos.
[00:48:45.744 --> 00:48:51.589]  I said, watch, it's going to be 4.1 when the next quarter comes in.
[00:48:51.609 --> 00:48:57.855]  And they announced the last quarter, and I can't even find it because it's so buried.
[00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:06.161]  See, I have this OCD thing about clips and about how I can't find the things.
[00:49:06.241 --> 00:49:09.163]  I mean, it's like not being able to find your kid's birth certificate, you know what I mean?
[00:49:09.263 --> 00:49:11.565]  And like, you know it was in this drawer and it's not there.
[00:49:11.825 --> 00:49:16.669]  But everybody remembers I said it'd be 4.1 according to White House sources that were in the economic meeting.
[00:49:16.709 --> 00:49:19.431]  Hell, I had Roger Stone on about it twice!
[00:49:21.232 --> 00:49:21.912]  It'll never be found.
[00:49:22.773 --> 00:49:28.597]  I could have $1 trillion and offer it, and it would not be found.
[00:49:29.518 --> 00:49:30.519]  The video would not be found.
[00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:32.080]  The article would not be found.
[00:49:33.391 --> 00:49:39.513]  I'll be in a coffee shop or at the grocery store in a month and some leftist will walk over and go, how do you like it beating up kids?
[00:49:39.913 --> 00:49:42.593]  Got banned on the internet for child endangerment beating that kid up.
[00:49:42.953 --> 00:49:43.674]  Ever beat a kid up?
[00:49:43.994 --> 00:49:44.634]  Total lie.
[00:49:44.854 --> 00:49:45.354]  Total hoax.
[00:49:45.554 --> 00:49:46.054]  They don't care.
[00:49:47.335 --> 00:49:49.055]  Because it's a world of delusion.
[00:49:49.295 --> 00:49:50.055]  It's like stelter.
[00:49:50.335 --> 00:49:54.997]  For a week one of our producers isn't allowed in the White House because we keep interrupting all the questions.
[00:49:55.297 --> 00:49:56.197]  We're being censored!
[00:49:56.237 --> 00:49:56.737]  Oh God!
[00:49:56.777 --> 00:50:00.298]  Next segment we're going to ban Alex Jones and we want Tucker Carlson off the air.
[00:50:13.183 --> 00:50:14.163]  I figured out what I've got to do.
[00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:23.707]  When I make a prediction, which it wasn't a prediction, we were told people in the meeting that it was going to be 4.1 at least, maybe 4.3, that's the headline, that I've got to actually take it, glue it to a wall.
[00:50:24.927 --> 00:50:28.909]  There's not that many, like one every couple of days, and they all come true, but then
[00:50:31.198 --> 00:50:31.939]  It's impossible.
[00:50:32.019 --> 00:50:38.425]  I will never, no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no matter... I'll never have it.
[00:50:38.706 --> 00:50:39.546]  Just, it will not happen.
[00:50:40.007 --> 00:50:40.427]  It just won't.
[00:50:40.447 --> 00:50:43.350]  This matter was multiple shows and articles and clips everywhere.
[00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.931]  It just won't happen.
[00:50:44.211 --> 00:50:47.114]  Because the search engines hide everything we do.
[00:50:47.434 --> 00:50:52.699]  Because they want to lie about who we are, while they lie about us and destroy us so we can't respond.
[00:50:54.241 --> 00:50:55.222]  That's how they operate.
[00:51:01.519 --> 00:51:01.999]  Oh, there it is.
[00:51:02.019 --> 00:51:02.420]  They found it.
[00:51:04.301 --> 00:51:05.382]  May 21st.
[00:51:07.123 --> 00:51:08.044]  MAGA agenda.
[00:51:08.144 --> 00:51:11.787]  Trump's economy projected to grow 4% in the next quarter.
[00:51:12.347 --> 00:51:15.330]  How the liberals spin the news to make Trump look bad.
[00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:18.793]  But see, it should be prediction.
[00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:19.633]  We broke that.
[00:51:19.853 --> 00:51:20.414]  Here, scroll down.
[00:51:22.253 --> 00:51:24.374]  And then Roger goes into his White House Economist.
[00:51:24.394 --> 00:51:24.834]  That was it.
[00:51:24.894 --> 00:51:25.535]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:25.555 --> 00:51:28.196]  He talked to the economist that was in the meeting with Kudlow.
[00:51:28.736 --> 00:51:31.118]  And they thought it could be even 4.3, but they weren't sure.
[00:51:31.258 --> 00:51:31.738]  Okay, there it is.
[00:51:31.818 --> 00:51:32.038]  Okay.
[00:51:32.298 --> 00:51:32.539]  Okay.
[00:51:33.079 --> 00:51:33.319]  Wow.
[00:51:33.399 --> 00:51:34.299]  Hell just froze over.
[00:51:34.319 --> 00:51:37.461]  Oh my gosh, I feel so good right now.
[00:51:38.842 --> 00:51:40.603]  Maybe I should just play that clip next hour.
[00:51:41.923 --> 00:51:43.784]  Because, I mean, I know we do this.
[00:51:43.925 --> 00:51:45.105]  I know we predict it all.
[00:51:45.625 --> 00:51:47.486]  And it wasn't even prediction.
[00:51:47.526 --> 00:51:48.267]  I mean, they were in the meeting.
[00:51:49.867 --> 00:51:59.374]  And they cautioned the president, don't say this yet, sir, because stuff could happen, but they thought 4.3, but they said some computer models show 4.1.
[00:51:59.414 --> 00:52:01.475]  It was all between 4.1 and 4.5.
[00:52:03.436 --> 00:52:04.117]  One model said 5.
[00:52:04.737 --> 00:52:13.503]  You notice weeks after we said that, there was a CNBC article that some models showed 5, but it was between basically 4 and 4.5, so we were saying 4.1.
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:20.562]  So, wow, that's 6% GDP growth right there.
[00:52:21.802 --> 00:52:22.963]  Point is, this is getting insane.
[00:52:24.384 --> 00:52:27.546]  But it's all because... Oh, I wasn't mad at the crew, they couldn't find it.
[00:52:27.946 --> 00:52:29.507]  Google buries this stuff, man.
[00:52:30.788 --> 00:52:33.090]  They're not gonna let us sit there and always be right.
[00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:34.951]  They can't stand it.
[00:52:34.991 --> 00:52:36.051]  Their job is to lie.
[00:52:36.452 --> 00:52:38.273]  Brian Stelter's job is to destroy the truth.
[00:52:41.135 --> 00:52:42.736]  Now let's go to what they don't want you to see.
[00:52:42.776 --> 00:52:43.857]  This triggered CNN.
[00:52:43.917 --> 00:52:49.040]  Now I've learned three different shows, not just Stelter, called it evil, dangerous, un-American, ban it, take it off.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.061]  I've got the articles right here.
[00:52:50.081 --> 00:52:51.702]  They're having a big international conference.
[00:52:52.623 --> 00:52:54.884]  They're calling for Fox News to be banned off Facebook.
[00:52:55.424 --> 00:52:55.865]  Here it is.
[00:52:55.925 --> 00:52:58.667]  Facebook asked to justify InfoWars and Fox News.
[00:52:58.947 --> 00:52:59.867]  Deadline Hollywood.
[00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:04.250]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[00:53:06.692 --> 00:53:07.572]  And then next?
[00:53:07.793 --> 00:53:09.834]  Oh, here's the next four conservatives to be banned.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:20.087]  And you read all these articles, it's like, oh, Stefan Molyneux and Steven Crowder, and then this girl isn't as big because the conservatives don't like women.
[00:53:20.227 --> 00:53:20.448]  What?
[00:53:20.908 --> 00:53:27.255]  It's just all cr- I told everybody this was coming, and now they're starting to lick their lips and go, we want Joe Rogan and Pootie Pie banned too.
[00:53:27.555 --> 00:53:30.498]  Because you've got billions of viewers over the years.
[00:53:30.619 --> 00:53:32.641]  They don't- you think Brian Stelter-
[00:53:34.208 --> 00:53:37.290]  Or Anderson Cooper, who had 4,000 views on average.
[00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:41.692]  His top was 5,000 in a show for Facebook.
[00:53:41.972 --> 00:53:49.335]  They pushed notification, millions of people, and they paid millions for the show, and all they've got is 5,000, 4,000, 5,000 viewers.
[00:53:49.636 --> 00:53:52.757]  Do you think Brian Stelter is going to let that continue?
[00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:54.698]  No!
[00:53:55.238 --> 00:54:02.582]  No one wants to watch some billionaire, rich, you know, kid of the asters.
[00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:04.651]  Right off a teleprompter!
[00:54:04.751 --> 00:54:06.211]  Good Lord!
[00:54:11.053 --> 00:54:14.635]  Here, let's go to Anderson Cooper explaining that America is an afterthought.
[00:54:14.675 --> 00:54:16.576]  No, it's not an afterthought, Cooper.
[00:54:16.856 --> 00:54:18.517]  Go to the final 1% where you get it.
[00:54:19.197 --> 00:54:21.378]  Where the enemy, as the President has said, here it is.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:27.922]  For more than a hundred years, the Democratic Party was organized around the interests of ordinary Americans.
[00:54:28.482 --> 00:54:35.425]  Democrats ran campaigns on things like higher wages, better working conditions, against the banks that crushed their voters with debt.
[00:54:36.165 --> 00:54:38.386]  A lot of Democratic ideas didn't always work.
[00:54:38.426 --> 00:54:39.146]  Some were silly.
[00:54:39.747 --> 00:54:41.888]  But their focus was always clear.
[00:54:42.228 --> 00:54:45.149]  American citizens were the party's priority.
[00:54:45.369 --> 00:54:47.070]  And that is no longer the case.
[00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:50.351]  To the modern Democratic Party, Americans are an afterthought.
[00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:58.076]  Try to find a Democrat running this year, for example, on the opioid crisis or high energy prices, the collapse of public schools, the decline of the middle class.
[00:54:59.117 --> 00:54:59.797]  Hard to find one.
[00:55:00.437 --> 00:55:02.038]  Democrats are bored by these topics.
[00:55:02.219 --> 00:55:03.880]  What interests them is power.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:09.403]  In order to win and maintain power, Democrats understand they need reliable new voters.
[00:55:09.864 --> 00:55:15.007]  Voters who will support them obediently without making difficult demands like a higher standard of living.
[00:55:15.748 --> 00:55:20.251]  That's why the Democratic Party suddenly supports open borders so fervently.
[00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:28.534]  Immigration is really the only issue that matters to them because packing the electorate is the only way they can regain control of this country.
[00:55:29.034 --> 00:55:30.134]  Their goal is clear.
[00:55:30.374 --> 00:55:31.735]  They will do... By the way, hit pause.
[00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:34.276]  This is so true is why they're calling for it to be banned.
[00:55:34.936 --> 00:55:37.557]  But remember, the Chi-Coms are funding it too, Anderson, as you exposed.
[00:55:37.577 --> 00:55:40.038]  So it's beyond just that they want to sell the country out.
[00:55:40.098 --> 00:55:40.978]  They hate the country.
[00:55:40.998 --> 00:55:42.819]  They've been trained and prepared for this.
[00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:43.159]  Continue.
[00:55:43.695 --> 00:55:48.138]  They are on a jihad to deport as many people as they can who they believe are not in the United States legally.
[00:56:06.513 --> 00:56:09.316]  Who they believe are not in the United States legally.
[00:56:09.416 --> 00:56:12.660]  Pretty easy to determine whether someone's here legally or not.
[00:56:13.181 --> 00:56:20.509]  And it wasn't that long ago that leading Democrats like Bill Clinton, for example, argued in public that our country should deport illegal immigrants.
[00:56:20.529 --> 00:56:22.251]  They're here illegally, after all.
[00:56:22.271 --> 00:56:23.272]  They're breaking our law.
[00:56:24.173 --> 00:56:29.980]  Now, Democrats claim that non-citizens, even illegal ones, have a right to vote in our elections.
[00:56:30.501 --> 00:56:33.385]  That is happening in San Francisco and in parts of the state of Maryland.
[00:56:33.965 --> 00:56:37.009]  But the 2020 election, it'll be happening in many other places.
[00:56:37.049 --> 00:56:37.970]  That's guaranteed.
[00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.933]  And remember, that was a thing we made up too.
[00:56:41.656 --> 00:56:43.718]  Republicans would be upset about this.
[00:56:43.878 --> 00:56:49.261]  Allowing illegals to occupy and run our country makes a mockery of citizenship.
[00:56:49.381 --> 00:56:53.223]  It's terrible for America, and it's a death sentence for the Republican Party.
[00:56:53.763 --> 00:56:56.605]  But no, Republicans on the Hill seem okay with this.
[00:56:57.165 --> 00:56:57.925]  Here's one example.
[00:56:58.466 --> 00:57:07.711]  In 2014, the Obama administration changed the rules so that anybody claiming a threat from gang violence or domestic abuse could get asylum in the United States.
[00:57:08.331 --> 00:57:13.493]  The effect was to allow pretty much anybody to permanently enter this country, provided they supplied the right story.
[00:57:13.933 --> 00:57:14.873]  And many, many did.
[00:57:15.513 --> 00:57:18.414]  Of course, that was precisely the point, to open the borders without saying so.
[00:57:19.054 --> 00:57:22.856]  Well, earlier this summer, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed the Obama rule.
[00:57:23.456 --> 00:57:29.538]  Now, House Republicans somehow, for some reason, are teaming up with Democrats to stop Sessions from doing that.
[00:57:30.038 --> 00:57:32.879]  Because they think if they butt-kiss mainstream media, they'll be nice to him.
[00:57:33.499 --> 00:57:35.440]  And then what did they do to Gates after he did that last week?
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:36.240]  They shadow-banned him.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.041]  You bend over to these people, they give it to you.
[00:57:39.541 --> 00:57:40.601]  Tower number two straight ahead.
[00:57:40.621 --> 00:57:41.782]  Great job Tucker Carlson, man.
[00:57:42.262 --> 00:57:43.342]  That's why they want him shut down.
[00:57:43.362 --> 00:57:45.663]  He's talking about the elephant in the room.
[00:57:45.683 --> 00:57:47.023]  That's why they want us all shut down.
[00:57:47.283 --> 00:57:49.404]  They can shut me down, they can shut you down.
[00:57:56.206 --> 00:58:02.908]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:03.949 --> 00:58:04.429]  It's you.
[00:58:08.717 --> 00:58:16.125]  The Info Warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:58:16.465 --> 00:58:20.709]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.951]  You are the Info Warrior.
[00:58:22.471 --> 00:58:25.995]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever.
[00:58:26.749 --> 00:58:38.295]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:58:38.355 --> 00:58:48.240]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:55.147]  They're trying to use InfoWars as an example of demonization to keep people from sharing this critical information.
[00:58:55.428 --> 00:58:59.712]  It's a model they admit they plan to use on everybody else once they're done with us.
[00:59:00.333 --> 00:59:09.343]  So when you promote the black sheep trailblazing information from NewsWars.com, from PrisonPlanet.com, from InfoWars.com, you are following in the footsteps
[00:59:09.423 --> 00:59:09.643]  I think?
[00:59:37.546 --> 00:59:38.367]  We are the future.
[00:59:38.387 --> 00:59:39.847]  We are the renaissance.
[00:59:39.887 --> 00:59:40.428]  And we are winning.
[00:59:40.988 --> 00:59:43.369]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.258 --> 01:00:08.399]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:14.143]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:15.824 --> 01:00:17.125]  Alright!
[01:00:33.977 --> 01:00:41.422]  If you go to the UK or you go to Australia, you go to New Zealand, you go to other areas, it's not just people being banned off the internet that are Christians or Conservatives or Patriots or Nationalists.
[01:00:42.062 --> 01:00:47.345]  It's being banned from countries, being kicked out of nations, being totally shut down.
[01:00:47.385 --> 01:00:56.871]  The Australian press celebrated the occupiers of Australia, our shadow ban, us being restricted and lied about what we did.
[01:00:56.891 --> 01:00:58.092]  So we got a pastor
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:06.348]  Uh, who's been persecuted, uh, joining us from Australia and what unfolded coming up in the next segments.
[01:01:06.368 --> 01:01:07.689]  This is a serious situation.
[01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:09.411]  We're gonna be looking at it, but take the crew.
[01:01:10.873 --> 01:01:12.475]  They're not the ones that were bad earlier.
[01:01:12.495 --> 01:01:16.239]  I want to be clear about not being able to find our prediction from May.
[01:01:18.689 --> 01:01:31.163]  Put it back on screen before anybody else did with economists in the White House meeting with Kudlow looking at computer projections for the quarter when it ended being between 4 and 4.5 percent maybe even higher.
[01:01:31.823 --> 01:01:37.109]  We exclusively broke White House economists predicts four plus percent growth rate.
[01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:38.631]  Scroll back up at the top.
[01:01:40.053 --> 01:01:41.474]  On May 21st.
[01:01:41.534 --> 01:01:45.056]  It wasn't until the middle of June you started hearing that from CNBC.
[01:01:45.596 --> 01:01:50.739]  Now, again, that's just another bombshell we broke first with exclusive intel.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.161]  And what has Google done?
[01:01:55.181 --> 01:01:56.322]  They've already delisted us.
[01:01:56.742 --> 01:01:58.223]  They've already banned us from Google Ads.
[01:01:58.283 --> 01:01:59.203]  They've already done all this.
[01:01:59.223 --> 01:02:00.384]  YouTube's already blocking us.
[01:02:01.344 --> 01:02:02.045]  They're a subsidiary.
[01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:06.227]  But now you try to search InfoWars.com.
[01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:09.105]  You try to search.
[01:02:09.265 --> 01:02:12.286]  I mean, we ourselves, Google is a broken search engine.
[01:02:12.386 --> 01:02:13.126]  It does not work.
[01:02:13.526 --> 01:02:16.307]  I came back there during the break and I said, stop using Google.
[01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:20.047]  You are not going to find anything when you do.
[01:02:20.067 --> 01:02:22.348]  I go, Microsoft is bad, but it's like the old Google.
[01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:23.328]  It halfway works.
[01:02:23.748 --> 01:02:24.788]  It's at least somewhat fair.
[01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:25.808]  Use Bing.
[01:02:25.848 --> 01:02:27.769]  And they said, no, that's how we just found it on Bing.
[01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:29.569]  And Startpage is great.
[01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:32.290]  It's a virtual browser, but it kind of uses Google and others.
[01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:33.250]  So you're still going through them.
[01:02:34.557 --> 01:02:37.159]  And I'm going to do a study of search engines.
[01:02:38.019 --> 01:02:40.881]  Because Google, until about three years ago, was the best big search engine.
[01:02:40.901 --> 01:02:43.643]  But now, it's just, I mean, you try to get anything.
[01:02:44.363 --> 01:02:46.945]  Christian, gun, nationalistic.
[01:02:47.585 --> 01:02:48.806]  It's all force-fed.
[01:02:49.226 --> 01:02:50.547]  The results are all paid.
[01:02:52.788 --> 01:02:53.769]  And Twitter's censoring.
[01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:54.589]  They're all doing it.
[01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:56.110]  They're shadowbanning everybody.
[01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:58.292]  Remember, we've been talking about shadowbanning for five years.
[01:02:59.537 --> 01:03:02.478]  I was on the phone with congressmen two weeks ago saying, you're going to be shadow banned.
[01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:03.619]  You're already being blocked.
[01:03:04.019 --> 01:03:04.799]  Look at our report.
[01:03:04.839 --> 01:03:05.540]  They're like, what?
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:05.900]  What?
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.361]  And finally they looked and now it's a big story.
[01:03:08.381 --> 01:03:10.022]  And I'm like, I'm not that important.
[01:03:11.642 --> 01:03:18.686]  If they're shadow banning Trump on Twitter for three years, where almost none of his push notifications go out, you've got to go to his Twitter to see it.
[01:03:20.346 --> 01:03:22.267]  Or the media is dumb enough to pick it up, then you see it.
[01:03:24.808 --> 01:03:26.409]  The president should understand that.
[01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.250]  I talked to folks that talked to the president.
[01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:31.858]  He didn't even understand this till a month ago.
[01:03:33.759 --> 01:03:34.660]  Now he understands it.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.821]  Now he's pointed out it's illegal.
[01:03:35.841 --> 01:03:42.205]  So, don't ever think your voice is small, because all of us that understand this, our voices are huge together.
[01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:46.268]  This is a big time to be alive, but we're going to retweet this at Real Alex Jones.
[01:03:46.288 --> 01:03:48.389]  They shadow banned it, but you can still say, hey, look, it's shadow banned.
[01:03:48.909 --> 01:03:49.590]  We're going to put it out.
[01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:50.790]  Flashback.
[01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:51.471]  We should flashback.
[01:03:51.831 --> 01:03:54.213]  Infowars.com broke 4.1%
[01:03:57.048 --> 01:04:02.131]  Growth rate in May and just have a screenshot of our article and a link right to it.
[01:04:02.531 --> 01:04:04.032]  We need to have a flashback right now.
[01:04:05.213 --> 01:04:07.915]  Because again, they keep saying we're fake news and they lie about what we said.
[01:04:07.955 --> 01:04:11.077]  They create fake news and say that we said the fake news and then blame us.
[01:04:13.098 --> 01:04:15.760]  And Facebook came out and said, no, Jones did not beat up a child.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.341]  Jones did not.
[01:04:20.211 --> 01:04:21.352]  So that nobody died at Parkland.
[01:04:21.372 --> 01:04:23.755]  Jones did not do these things, but it didn't matter.
[01:04:23.775 --> 01:04:29.241]  The pressure got put on the corporates, and they banned us on our main site, reaching millions of subscribers.
[01:04:29.942 --> 01:04:31.804]  And sure, you say, oh, you're on a sub-site still streaming.
[01:04:32.104 --> 01:04:36.309]  Listen, we're on 200-plus radio stations, hundreds and hundreds of TV stations, 80-plus cable stations.
[01:04:36.329 --> 01:04:36.709]  That's great.
[01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:41.671]  The point is, is that if they can shut us down, they can shut everybody down.
[01:04:41.971 --> 01:04:43.512]  And now they're calling for everybody else to be shut down.
[01:04:43.532 --> 01:04:48.833]  So I keep harping on this, because globally they're making their move against the West, against Christianity.
[01:04:49.193 --> 01:04:51.414]  The Chi-Coms are funding it from Australia to the U.S.
[01:04:51.794 --> 01:04:52.654]  They're the ones doing it.
[01:04:52.714 --> 01:04:57.495]  And if we wake up to that, as a culture, it will unify us around free speech and we will win.
[01:04:57.835 --> 01:04:59.996]  If we don't wake up, they're going to win the midterms.
[01:05:03.072 --> 01:05:06.773]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:05:06.913 --> 01:05:11.974]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[01:05:12.134 --> 01:05:13.314]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:13.454 --> 01:05:15.074]  It is absolutely free.
[01:05:15.294 --> 01:05:20.255]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[01:05:20.496 --> 01:05:24.356]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:05:24.456 --> 01:05:28.357]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[01:05:28.577 --> 01:05:32.678]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:33.118 --> 01:05:39.520]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:46.402]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[01:05:46.422 --> 01:06:01.967]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[01:06:08.383 --> 01:06:19.014]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.793 --> 01:06:41.260]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars, and in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.221]  Austin, Texas.
[01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:53.753]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[01:06:54.634 --> 01:07:00.280]  While the old guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape rocked by innovation and technology,
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.483]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[01:07:05.023 --> 01:07:16.531]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[01:07:17.651 --> 01:07:26.517]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[01:07:26.778 --> 01:07:28.238]  Demand truth.
[01:07:28.379 --> 01:07:30.080]  Demand InfoWars.
[01:07:31.861 --> 01:07:32.601]  InfoWars.
[01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:33.881]  Tomorrow's News.
[01:07:34.162 --> 01:07:34.562]  Today.
[01:07:34.582 --> 01:07:49.868]  Alright, coming up for the last 45 minutes of this hour, three quarters of the broadcast of this hour, we're going to be talking to a pastor who's being demonized, who's being lied about, who's being ostracized, who's being deported to foreign countries for preaching the gospel in Australia and New Zealand.
[01:07:49.888 --> 01:07:50.529]  That's coming up.
[01:07:51.369 --> 01:07:52.549]  Pastor Logan Robertson.
[01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:57.932]  Whether you agree with what he says or disagree, actually go hear what he has to say, not what the media says, because
[01:07:58.848 --> 01:07:59.609]  Let me explain something.
[01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:02.672]  I keep saying it, but I'm going to break this down.
[01:08:04.134 --> 01:08:15.147]  The level of disinfo and lies that we see out of corporate dinosaur media all over the world now is five times more insane than during the campaign.
[01:08:17.739 --> 01:08:20.801]  Because they were worried to push too hard and wake people up before with their lies.
[01:08:21.202 --> 01:08:25.705]  So they rigged debates, and they lied, and they said Hillary didn't fall down and all that.
[01:08:26.105 --> 01:08:29.207]  They said anybody that votes for conservatives is a racist, or whatever.
[01:08:29.868 --> 01:08:34.972]  But it didn't work, so they went, well, we have no choice but to go all the way in.
[01:08:35.452 --> 01:08:44.959]  Now, why is CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the BBC, I mean literally thousands of publications a day, saying ban InfoWars?
[01:08:46.817 --> 01:08:47.417]  It's not about us.
[01:08:47.797 --> 01:08:49.978]  Because once they set the precedent for us, it's everybody.
[01:08:51.759 --> 01:08:54.360]  And sure enough, they're saying ban Fox News off Twitter and Facebook.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.161]  Sure enough, they're saying ban Tucker Carlson.
[01:08:57.181 --> 01:08:58.821]  Because they know he's the most on target.
[01:08:59.081 --> 01:08:59.881]  Ban Sean Hannity.
[01:09:00.942 --> 01:09:02.142]  They're making their move.
[01:09:03.083 --> 01:09:03.863]  Because they're desperate.
[01:09:04.403 --> 01:09:06.124]  And they're trying to cause civil unrest.
[01:09:06.144 --> 01:09:07.104]  They're trying to cause riots.
[01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:10.045]  I've got all these videos on Infowars.com, we'll get to next hour.
[01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:13.406]  Where, I mean, they are just beating up Christians, conservatives.
[01:09:13.706 --> 01:09:14.927]  The left is out in force.
[01:09:15.067 --> 01:09:15.727]  It is crazy.
[01:09:17.642 --> 01:09:20.003]  Pelosi and Maxine Waters are calling for all this violence.
[01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:29.145]  And then they misrepresent with hoaxes, just like they launched the first Iraq war, claiming that babies were thrown in incubators and their brains stomped out.
[01:09:31.826 --> 01:09:36.227]  They're saying that I beat up a kid in Missouri, in CNN Forbes.
[01:09:36.787 --> 01:09:40.768]  They had to retract it, but it didn't matter by then, and that that's why my YouTube channel was blocked.
[01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:41.609]  No it wasn't!
[01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:46.250]  I showed ABC News, showing this kid, punching a guy in the face, so that guy pushes him down.
[01:09:48.339 --> 01:09:54.581]  But again, you have to understand, why would they tell such blatant lies when they're so verifiably false?
[01:09:55.281 --> 01:09:56.922]  Because they're planning something big.
[01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.682]  They're making their move, not just here, but worldwide.
[01:09:59.603 --> 01:10:06.065]  With civil unrest, with election fraud, with all these cities legalizing illegal aliens voting, which they always denied they were doing.
[01:10:06.425 --> 01:10:07.745]  They're making their move.
[01:10:07.785 --> 01:10:09.406]  You can feel it in your gut, your spirit.
[01:10:09.786 --> 01:10:10.406]  You can see it.
[01:10:13.257 --> 01:10:20.223]  And it's because big corporate government's in trouble, the Communist Chinese are in trouble, Hollywood's in trouble, the NFL's got 30-40% less viewers.
[01:10:20.623 --> 01:10:21.464]  Same with Hollywood.
[01:10:22.525 --> 01:10:24.046]  They pay tens of millions of dollars.
[01:10:26.065 --> 01:10:36.936]  $18 million for Anderson Cooper to launch this big, vaunted, hyped, everywhere show daily on Facebook.
[01:10:37.056 --> 01:10:38.837]  And they put push notifications out.
[01:10:38.877 --> 01:10:41.740]  I never got a push notification for my own live feeds on my phone.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.082]  I got one Monday and Tuesday night.
[01:10:44.863 --> 01:10:45.784]  Watch Anderson Cooper.
[01:10:49.738 --> 01:10:51.838]  They had an average of 4,000 viewers, a peak of 5,500.
[01:10:52.439 --> 01:10:55.439]  He had Jim Acosta, the fake news king, on.
[01:10:57.579 --> 01:11:02.380]  So, before they shadow-banned us on Facebook, our average video had a million, two million views.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.661]  I mean, I could sit at my dinner table and do one at midnight and have a million views.
[01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:08.321]  Then, I got calls.
[01:11:08.341 --> 01:11:11.262]  Come to New York, meet with Facebook, you're really big, blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:12.922]  Leave us alone, play ball.
[01:11:13.382 --> 01:11:16.483]  This was an off-record meeting, so I can't get into who said it, but it was high-level folks.
[01:11:17.619 --> 01:11:21.302]  You'll be part of this trusted guardian group we're going to set up that years later they've now set up.
[01:11:21.342 --> 01:11:27.768]  They just said, just play ball with us, stop bashing, come meet and get our agenda, and we'll let you reach your followers and you'll be number one.
[01:11:28.268 --> 01:11:31.591]  And for about a month, it was like 5 million, 10 million views a video.
[01:11:31.631 --> 01:11:34.834]  I was like, God Almighty, they were just letting my viewers see me.
[01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:41.192]  Didn't play ball, they restricted it down to, you know, a couple hundred thousand and then they crushed that down.
[01:11:41.532 --> 01:11:49.356]  What they found is, they did big studies on it last week, the news put it out, everybody copied it and put it elsewhere, so they realized what I already knew, it was a feeder.
[01:11:50.457 --> 01:11:51.097]  It was a feeder.
[01:11:51.898 --> 01:11:54.799]  And I don't want to put out a lie to ten million people, I want to put the truth out to a thousand.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.980]  Because then it will grow, the truth grows.
[01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:04.825]  A lie can go halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on, but the lie doesn't have roots, it just blows over in the wind, to use a biblical analogy.
[01:12:06.067 --> 01:12:10.331]  Well the seeds fall on the rocks, the birds eat it.
[01:12:10.371 --> 01:12:19.400]  I'd rather have one big oak tree that's there for a thousand years than a bunch of stuff that just blows away and a thousand little plants come up and the first sun comes out in the summer and it's all dead.
[01:12:19.421 --> 01:12:23.344]  That's not a place to put a swing set up for my kids.
[01:12:26.389 --> 01:12:27.490]  That's not a future, is it?
[01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:29.771]  See, so I want real people.
[01:12:29.871 --> 01:12:30.851]  I don't want fluff.
[01:12:31.211 --> 01:12:31.852]  I don't want hype.
[01:12:31.892 --> 01:12:32.572]  I don't want deception.
[01:12:32.612 --> 01:12:33.472]  I want the diamonds.
[01:12:33.993 --> 01:12:36.674]  I don't want the chaff.
[01:12:38.114 --> 01:12:39.495]  And that's why they're so angry.
[01:12:40.195 --> 01:12:51.881]  Can you imagine their full push and push notifications to millions of people saying Anderson Cooper is on with all the hype on every channel, Anderson Cooper, like God was returning to Earth.
[01:12:53.632 --> 01:13:03.604]  And they shoot it like it's low-tech, and they have, like, honking cars in the background, like, oh, it's low-tech.
[01:13:03.624 --> 01:13:04.586]  4,000 viewers per 20 minutes.
[01:13:05.707 --> 01:13:08.631]  Ladies and gentlemen, a teenager picking their nose has more viewers.
[01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:10.555]  They're dead.
[01:13:10.956 --> 01:13:12.876]  You can't make people watch it.
[01:13:12.956 --> 01:13:14.617]  You can't make them listen.
[01:13:15.198 --> 01:13:22.481]  And so they look at us, despite everything they've done, gaining hundreds of TV stations, all this, they don't know what to do.
[01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:27.483]  So they want it all, and they want it now, so they're going to engage in fraud and bullying.
[01:13:27.984 --> 01:13:31.005]  Used to, CNN would run months of propaganda to invade some terrible country.
[01:13:31.705 --> 01:13:33.166]  Now they run months of propaganda.
[01:13:33.266 --> 01:13:36.708]  Four months of every day, shut down Alex Jones.
[01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:41.984]  To get a couple strikes and freeze us live streaming?
[01:13:43.305 --> 01:13:44.105]  They're pathetic!
[01:13:44.945 --> 01:13:48.986]  It's not that I'm that strong, it's that they're that weak.
[01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:57.549]  They're pathetic, but we still, even Republican congressmen, sing it in, say something nice about me, I'll be nice!
[01:13:57.929 --> 01:14:06.792]  It's like you're a trained seal, it'd be like a mouse training a lion to grovel before it, but it's like, more like a bacteria training a
[01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.304]  Lion to bow before it.
[01:14:10.424 --> 01:14:11.024]  It's a hoax!
[01:14:11.885 --> 01:14:12.745]  It's all a joke!
[01:14:13.025 --> 01:14:13.585]  They're done!
[01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:17.147]  Unless they can cause a civil war, unless they can cause garbage.
[01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:30.033]  We'll go out to break with a clip of Mark Dice, the full clips at markdice.com, where he goes over the numbers of 4,000 viewers, on average, during his 20-minute show, that cost $18 million, shot on an iPhone as a sick joke, showing the disconnect of these people.
[01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:32.694]  Then we'll come back with the next level of persecution,
[01:14:33.414 --> 01:14:39.237]  Actually, like China's doing, not letting you fly, not letting you live in a country, going after you with this global social score.
[01:14:39.457 --> 01:14:39.938]  Here's a clip.
[01:14:40.698 --> 01:14:49.202]  Yesterday, Anderson Cooper kicked off his brand new Facebook live stream, which he's going to be doing five days a week, which Facebook is paying CNN to produce.
[01:14:49.643 --> 01:14:51.544]  Let's take a look and see how it went.
[01:14:52.426 --> 01:14:53.567]  Now, as I said, remarkable.
[01:14:53.587 --> 01:14:57.130]  It didn't take long for Democrats to chastise President Trump, probably no surprise there.
[01:14:57.570 --> 01:15:03.695]  Some Republicans also condemned the President, most notably Senator John McCain, said in a statement, I want to read part of it to you.
[01:15:03.975 --> 01:15:18.247]  You may be wondering what that noise is in the background, and it's actually an audio track that they played throughout the entire broadcast, trying to be like some cool, hip, millennial YouTube vlogger, which plays annoying background music during their entire YouTube video.
[01:15:18.407 --> 01:15:20.627]  Later in the show, he was joined by Jim Acosta.
[01:15:20.927 --> 01:15:27.749]  And as you can see by the live viewer count here, they didn't even have 5,000 people tuning into the stream.
[01:15:28.049 --> 01:15:37.650]  And look at this, they're formatting the show vertically for mobile devices because apparently their audience doesn't know that you can turn your phone sideways and expand it full screen when you're watching media.
[01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:43.031]  Later in the stream, Anderson decided to answer some audience questions to make the show interactive.
[01:15:43.431 --> 01:15:46.832]  And by that time, the viewership had dropped down to under 4,000 people.
[01:15:48.272 --> 01:15:51.475]  What story did you do that had a long-lasting effect on you?
[01:15:51.495 --> 01:15:53.317]  You can't quit looking at Mark Dice.
[01:15:53.857 --> 01:15:56.079]  Have you noticed that he's alive and being real?
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.921]  You can't even look at Cooper when he's on.
[01:15:58.362 --> 01:15:59.523]  You're all looking at Dice!
[01:16:00.043 --> 01:16:01.224]  Of course they want to shut us down!
[01:16:01.264 --> 01:16:01.905]  They can't compete!
[01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:07.797]  I don't sell snake oil, I sell fish oil.
[01:16:08.758 --> 01:16:10.820]  And some of the cleanest, most concentrated out there.
[01:16:13.003 --> 01:16:15.385]  There's one thing I take every day and that's fish oil.
[01:16:15.586 --> 01:16:21.472]  And so, this has been a couple years in the making because I wasn't just going to go out to one of the big suppliers.
[01:16:21.713 --> 01:16:24.416]  It already cost a lot to have them do the process where it removes the mercury.
[01:16:24.736 --> 01:16:26.336]  We have it at non-detectable levels.
[01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:31.418]  Some spectrometers might pick up a molecule of it or something under California standards, so we don't say mercury-free.
[01:16:31.458 --> 01:16:35.179]  But it's basically the cleanest fish oil, krill oil, you name it, there is.
[01:16:35.579 --> 01:16:36.899]  Because, you know, we don't get it from tuna.
[01:16:36.919 --> 01:16:39.380]  We get it from small fish and things like that, so it doesn't bioaccumulate.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.140]  Then they have a program that extracts it out.
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.361]  But that's the only negative to fish oil and krill oil and things.
[01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:49.322]  We have stuff that, from the top firms in the country, ultimate krill oil, on a roll for your children.
[01:16:49.702 --> 01:16:52.843]  Ultimate fish oil that are so game-changing.
[01:16:53.023 --> 01:16:53.524]  It's insane.
[01:16:53.624 --> 01:17:14.852]  I mean these are big glass bottles with two month Supplies for the price right below leading competitors So x2 is the only thing that gives you the dramatic results that I within just days that I've seen with these this baby's filled Right to the top look at that I mean that's as strong as it gets by the way to look at those horse pills that right there is Liquid fuel for the brain your heart your whole body that is magic right there
[01:17:17.862 --> 01:17:22.624]  It took us years because I said I want the cleanest, strongest there is.
[01:17:22.724 --> 01:17:24.884]  Because I want to give you what I'm going to take.
[01:17:24.964 --> 01:17:27.505]  So, Ultimate Fish Oil, Target Release Fish Oil.
[01:17:27.685 --> 01:17:28.826]  It's got everything in it.
[01:17:28.906 --> 01:17:31.006]  This has got the stuff that's good for the heart and for the brain.
[01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:33.727]  Krill Oil is a different formulation, but similar.
[01:17:33.747 --> 01:17:34.648]  It's excellent as well.
[01:17:34.788 --> 01:17:39.309]  What matters is krill's so small that they still denature and try to get any mercury out.
[01:17:39.329 --> 01:17:44.631]  But when they test it, they can't find it anyway, so they still do the process because krill's so little that it doesn't bioaccumulate.
[01:17:44.651 --> 01:17:46.112]  This is clean, clean, clean.
[01:17:46.172 --> 01:17:47.272]  And then you've got Honor Oil.
[01:17:47.612 --> 01:17:50.956]  This is why it took us a couple years, because I could have instantly private-labeled something.
[01:17:50.976 --> 01:17:59.444]  I said, no, I want all the oils that are known for the brain to be the very, very best, and I want it at a price way below anybody else, and I want it stronger.
[01:17:59.464 --> 01:18:00.425]  I don't want fillers.
[01:18:00.525 --> 01:18:01.306]  We have done it.
[01:18:01.526 --> 01:18:02.707]  This baby right here.
[01:18:05.627 --> 01:18:09.130]  I mean, you want to give your children the boost they need.
[01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:10.170]  I mean, this is it.
[01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:11.511]  Ladies and gentlemen, just look at it.
[01:18:11.591 --> 01:18:12.092]  Look at that.
[01:18:12.112 --> 01:18:14.073]  Everybody else is just, like, yellow or clear.
[01:18:14.133 --> 01:18:15.534]  That's because it's been denatured.
[01:18:15.554 --> 01:18:16.334]  It's been watered down.
[01:18:16.755 --> 01:18:17.535]  We didn't do that.
[01:18:19.196 --> 01:18:23.279]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that isn't the very best I can get?
[01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.321]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:18:27.484 --> 01:18:28.064]  That's for me.
[01:18:28.084 --> 01:18:29.686]  You understand the selfishness of this?
[01:18:30.166 --> 01:18:38.693]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:18:38.773 --> 01:18:40.455]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:18:40.495 --> 01:18:41.576]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:42.256]  It's a win-win.
[01:18:42.396 --> 01:18:45.459]  You fund us in the face of the enemies that want to shut down your free speech.
[01:18:45.759 --> 01:18:47.620]  By God, I'm on every channel in the country every day.
[01:18:47.861 --> 01:18:48.461]  Destroy me.
[01:18:48.541 --> 01:18:48.922]  Kill me.
[01:18:48.982 --> 01:18:49.302]  Shut me up.
[01:18:49.542 --> 01:18:49.782]  Why?
[01:18:49.802 --> 01:18:51.263]  The spirit of the world wants to stop us.
[01:18:51.303 --> 01:18:51.703]  Why is that?
[01:18:52.064 --> 01:18:53.405]  It's because we want justice.
[01:18:53.425 --> 01:18:54.425]  We want freedom.
[01:18:54.445 --> 01:18:57.207]  We don't care what color you are, what gender you are, where you're from.
[01:18:57.227 --> 01:18:58.308]  I want you to have a future.
[01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:06.212]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:09.935]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[01:19:10.295 --> 01:19:19.823]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:20.703]  Study.
[01:19:21.003 --> 01:19:23.745]  This formula is 24 ppm.
[01:19:24.105 --> 01:19:25.885]  That's 32 ppm version.
[01:19:26.226 --> 01:19:29.067]  Is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[01:19:29.127 --> 01:19:31.488]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[01:19:31.748 --> 01:19:36.290]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:37.010]  Ah, you don't want that.
[01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:41.213]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[01:19:41.433 --> 01:19:44.116]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[01:19:44.376 --> 01:19:47.679]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[01:19:48.059 --> 01:19:53.363]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[01:19:53.423 --> 01:19:57.587]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[01:19:58.447 --> 01:20:01.110]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[01:20:06.247 --> 01:20:10.851]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.474 --> 01:20:17.176]  If you leave me... If you leave me... I won't miss you.
[01:20:35.948 --> 01:20:38.310]  And I won't ever take you back.
[01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:39.731]  George Strait bringing us in.
[01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:40.652]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:41.172 --> 01:20:42.874]  From deep in the heart of Texas, the ATX.
[01:20:45.656 --> 01:20:49.058]  You know, think about the memory of the First Amendment, if they're really able to shut it down.
[01:20:49.118 --> 01:20:55.984]  Because the digital system lets you spread info, but it also lets you track people, control their movements, and shut them down economically.
[01:20:56.124 --> 01:20:57.305]  Mark of the beast level stuff.
[01:20:58.851 --> 01:21:01.953]  And whether you believe in God or not, in Revelation, it's coming true.
[01:21:01.993 --> 01:21:08.118]  They're announcing world government, world taxation, world ID numbers, world social scores.
[01:21:08.198 --> 01:21:10.920]  It's all being adopted by Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Google.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:11.360]  We're here!
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:17.605]  And we've got a chance, though, to get Congress to get involved, the President involved.
[01:21:17.625 --> 01:21:18.165]  We're doing that.
[01:21:18.185 --> 01:21:25.731]  I'm going to go to our guest, but here's my letter to CNN's so-called reporter, Mr. Darcy.
[01:21:27.771 --> 01:21:31.072]  Who sent us a comment last night to see if we wanted to get a comment on the story.
[01:21:31.092 --> 01:21:38.255]  And he says, does Infowars or Alex Jones have a comment on Facebook removing four videos from its pages?
[01:21:38.855 --> 01:21:41.516]  So he can pretend like he's a journalist and not an anti-free speech hack.
[01:21:42.216 --> 01:21:48.819]  I said, Mr. Darcy, you're asking me for a comment about Facebook removing videos that you and your organization lobbied to be removed.
[01:21:49.899 --> 01:21:50.760]  My comment is this.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.901]  CNN and its parent company Time Warner are part of a
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:22:11.474]  ...organization, and I continue, CNN, its parent company, Time Warner, are put on notice to cease and desist in your tortious interference activities of publicly calling for my free speech to be banned, my company to be bankrupted, and for us to be deplatformed across the internet.
[01:22:12.836 --> 01:22:15.778]  Your activity is extremely criminal and un-American.
[01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:19.962]  It's, I would add, defamatory, bullying a straw man, so you can then have a public lynching.
[01:22:21.132 --> 01:22:28.354]  Your campaign against competing news organizations and the First Amendment is outrageously anti-American and will not succeed long-term.
[01:22:28.934 --> 01:22:32.275]  America is aware and awake to you and CNN.
[01:22:32.695 --> 01:22:34.415]  CNN is beyond fake news.
[01:22:34.475 --> 01:22:38.316]  CNN is a criminal combine working to destroy the First Amendment.
[01:22:39.756 --> 01:22:43.137]  You can send him any emails you want that go into a black hole.
[01:22:43.157 --> 01:22:46.278]  But the point is, is that
[01:22:47.438 --> 01:22:48.880]  They're dead already politically.
[01:22:49.601 --> 01:22:52.424]  I don't mean physically before they... Jones threatens Darcy with death!
[01:22:52.484 --> 01:22:54.066]  I mean, politically they're dead.
[01:22:55.328 --> 01:22:56.549]  There's no fruit off this tree.
[01:22:58.191 --> 01:23:02.837]  And if you want to look at where we're going to be, Germany and Australia and other places have great people in them, but...
[01:23:04.192 --> 01:23:07.354]  They arrest you if you criticize Islam on Facebook.
[01:23:07.394 --> 01:23:10.556]  They hired former Stasi, especially in New Zealand, Australia.
[01:23:10.577 --> 01:23:11.617]  They're cracking down on people.
[01:23:12.278 --> 01:23:16.981]  And we are joined by Pastor Logan Robertson.
[01:23:17.001 --> 01:23:20.604]  He was born and raised in New Zealand.
[01:23:20.664 --> 01:23:25.667]  He is grateful that he was raised in a loving Christian home and was saved as a young child.
[01:23:26.207 --> 01:23:29.490]  He's happily married for almost 12 years, and the Lord blessed him with five children.
[01:23:30.951 --> 01:23:33.513]  But now it's in the news
[01:23:34.721 --> 01:23:36.785]  That he's been deported from his own country.
[01:23:37.787 --> 01:23:38.929]  Sent into the Phantom Zone.
[01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:41.694]  Deported New Zealand pastor Logan Robertson.
[01:23:42.728 --> 01:23:45.991]  Now shows no remorse for harassing sissy Muslims.
[01:23:46.011 --> 01:23:46.892]  That's the media spin.
[01:23:47.652 --> 01:23:49.654]  Oh, it's not the Muslims killing us?
[01:23:50.274 --> 01:23:54.698]  And so we've also got Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux, they're now calling for being banned.
[01:23:55.058 --> 01:23:57.200]  They're not allowed to operate in Australia either.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.661]  So this is happening.
[01:23:58.681 --> 01:24:01.704]  But wow, a man with no country, a stranger in a strange land.
[01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:04.606]  Pastor Logan, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:24:05.447 --> 01:24:15.550]  Boil down for people what actually happened to you, what's going on, the next level of tyranny, before we get into the specifics of, you know, all the little fine details, just the basics of what happened.
[01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:19.511]  All right, thanks for having me on.
[01:24:19.551 --> 01:24:24.433]  So, earlier this month, on the 4th of July, we went to a mosque.
[01:24:24.973 --> 01:24:32.195]  We were making a documentary exposing Islam, and we were asking the imam if we could do an interview with him.
[01:24:33.451 --> 01:24:43.496]  Once he, you know, he said to bring him back, we're leaving, there were some young teenagers yelled out a few words to us when we were leaving.
[01:24:44.096 --> 01:24:48.979]  And so I just, I just turned around and asked them, you know, how old was Aisha?
[01:24:49.499 --> 01:24:52.301]  Which was one of Muhammad's many wives.
[01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:54.802]  And he couldn't answer me.
[01:24:54.862 --> 01:24:56.163]  So I called him a sissy.
[01:24:56.763 --> 01:24:57.543]  And then we left.
[01:24:58.023 --> 01:24:58.804]  The next day,
[01:24:59.648 --> 01:25:03.129]  We had an interview set up at another mosque.
[01:25:03.529 --> 01:25:07.330]  We went there, and the media just turned up, surrounded us.
[01:25:08.911 --> 01:25:10.711]  We didn't have our own interview, obviously.
[01:25:11.211 --> 01:25:12.752]  And the media just turned up.
[01:25:13.012 --> 01:25:15.793]  After that, the next day, the police arrest me.
[01:25:16.393 --> 01:25:18.453]  They arrest three other men from our church.
[01:25:19.054 --> 01:25:20.354]  Then, you know,
[01:25:21.401 --> 01:25:36.425]  I get out on bail, then the Border Patrol turn up, this is in Australia, the Border Patrol turn up, take me from my house and then put me in a detention centre for 12 days before they send me back to New Zealand where I was born.
[01:25:36.926 --> 01:25:49.029]  But I was, as a New Zealand citizen, you're allowed to live in Australia for as long as you like and you can work in Australia, but if you talk bad about Islam, you know, you get sent back.
[01:25:50.736 --> 01:25:52.317]  I'm not in New Zealand at the moment.
[01:25:52.357 --> 01:25:54.018]  I'm on a mission trip in the Philippines.
[01:25:55.379 --> 01:25:57.040]  That's the quick rundown.
[01:25:59.081 --> 01:26:03.964]  It's just crazy because the headlines reported New Zealand passed, but that means deported from Australia to New Zealand.
[01:26:05.365 --> 01:26:15.672]  Why do you think all the Western world, they cover up this latest Islamic attack in Toronto, they cover it all up, they're just obsessed, the police, the government, with covering up for Islam globally?
[01:26:19.348 --> 01:26:25.734]  I'm not 100% sure why they do it, but I think they just want it to take over in the Western countries.
[01:26:26.555 --> 01:26:35.122]  I'm not 100% sure why, but the Bible says in Ephesians 6 that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against the higher powers of this world.
[01:26:35.663 --> 01:26:45.792]  And it's obviously the higher powers that are trying to promote Islam, and they don't want Christians in the Western countries anymore.
[01:26:48.188 --> 01:26:53.612]  Describe what it's like, though, to watch this invasion and just other observations.
[01:26:55.913 --> 01:27:04.659]  Yeah, well, in New Zealand it's not as bad, but Australia, you know, they let Muslims in, you know, just freely.
[01:27:06.650 --> 01:27:13.311]  I believe there's 600,000 Muslims in Australia now, and there's about 20-24 million people.
[01:27:14.071 --> 01:27:16.012]  But it's increasing, you know, day by day.
[01:27:16.372 --> 01:27:24.153]  They're bringing in all the Muslim refugees, and parts of Sydney is pretty much Sharia law there.
[01:27:25.053 --> 01:27:35.215]  I watched a lady that was in there a few days ago, and the police told her that she wasn't even allowed to talk to anybody in the streets there.
[01:27:36.081 --> 01:27:43.146]  Just because, you know, it might cause, um, you know, public disturbance just for talking to Muslims.
[01:27:44.067 --> 01:27:47.269]  So I'm not, I'm not sure what it's like.
[01:27:47.289 --> 01:27:52.093]  I also read about just all the crimes being committed, not just in Australia, but in Europe, you name it.
[01:27:52.113 --> 01:27:53.273]  And then they just cover it up.
[01:27:53.694 --> 01:27:56.015]  And a large portion of the Muslims never get jobs.
[01:27:57.596 --> 01:27:58.017]  That's right.
[01:27:59.018 --> 01:28:02.240]  In Australia, a lot of them are unemployed and there are,
[01:28:03.715 --> 01:28:12.160]  I know in Melbourne there's big gangs of Muslims there from Africa, which cause a lot of problems.
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:17.743]  And they go to prison maybe for a little while, or they get released on bail.
[01:28:17.783 --> 01:28:22.166]  But they don't get sent back to their country.
[01:28:22.726 --> 01:28:24.287]  They're allowed to stay in Australia.
[01:28:25.674 --> 01:28:26.214]  We're about to go to break.
[01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:27.796]  We're going to play some of these clips when we come back.
[01:28:27.836 --> 01:28:28.516]  Pretty powerful stuff.
[01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:29.157]  But let me ask you this.
[01:28:29.777 --> 01:28:34.461]  Am I wrong to say from what I read and what I hear that Australia and New Zealand is starting to wake up though?
[01:28:36.122 --> 01:28:45.310]  Yeah, I believe there's a lot of people that are waking up to this and hearing the truth about that it is a wicked false religion.
[01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:54.217]  At the moment, they might be a little peaceful in our countries, but when they get their numbers up, you can see like in England,
[01:28:56.117 --> 01:28:57.158]  They will start rioting.
[01:28:57.178 --> 01:28:59.278]  They will start causing a lot of problems.
[01:28:59.498 --> 01:29:00.599]  And they're used by the leftists.
[01:29:00.619 --> 01:29:01.519]  They're brought in to do that.
[01:29:02.659 --> 01:29:10.662]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from Infowarslife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.
[01:29:10.922 --> 01:29:13.263]  And listen, everybody's got a heart.
[01:29:13.863 --> 01:29:19.224]  Well, actually, maybe Hillary and George Soros don't, but everybody else has a heart, and this product is amazing.
[01:29:19.305 --> 01:29:20.385]  So, if you have a heart,

[01:29:39.056 --> 01:29:40.797]  It's one of the very best heart pills out there.
[01:29:41.118 --> 01:29:41.898]  It's Xtend-A-Wise.
[01:29:42.098 --> 01:29:44.800]  So, get some for yourself and family and friends.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.262]  It's got the very best fish oil from the Fjords.
[01:29:48.302 --> 01:29:53.666]  It's very, very pure, very clean and has the EPA type that is specifically good for the heart cardiovascular system.
[01:29:54.327 --> 01:29:57.829]  It's got the properly formulated type of CoQ10 and more.
[01:29:58.169 --> 01:29:59.730]  It is Xtend-A-Wise.
[01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:01.932]  Now available at mfulwarslife.com.
[01:30:05.046 --> 01:30:08.048]  I don't sell snake oil, I sell fish oil.
[01:30:09.008 --> 01:30:12.951]  And some of the cleanest, most concentrated out there, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:13.271 --> 01:30:15.652]  There's one thing I take every day and that's fish oil.
[01:30:15.833 --> 01:30:21.716]  And so, this has been a couple years in the making because I wasn't just going to go out to one of the big suppliers.
[01:30:21.736 --> 01:30:24.678]  It already cost a lot to have them do the process where it removes the mercury.
[01:30:24.998 --> 01:30:26.619]  We have it at non-detectable levels.
[01:30:26.679 --> 01:30:31.682]  Some spectrometers might pick up a molecule of it or something under California standards so we don't say mercury-free.
[01:30:31.723 --> 01:30:35.425]  But it's basically the cleanest fish oil, krill oil, you name it, there is.
[01:30:35.445 --> 01:30:39.648]  Because, you know, we don't get it from tuna, we get it from small fish and things like that so it doesn't bioaccumulate.
[01:30:40.228 --> 01:30:40.748]  I don't know.
[01:31:10.448 --> 01:31:13.872]  That right there is liquid fuel for the brain, your heart, your whole body.
[01:31:13.912 --> 01:31:15.254]  That is magic right there.
[01:31:15.334 --> 01:31:16.035]  Look at those babies.
[01:31:16.055 --> 01:31:18.057]  You know anybody else got them as orange like that?
[01:31:18.137 --> 01:31:22.883]  It took us years because I said I want the cleanest, strongest there is.
[01:31:23.003 --> 01:31:25.226]  Because I want to give you what I'm gonna take.
[01:31:25.266 --> 01:31:25.406]  Show!
[01:31:25.586 --> 01:31:27.767]  Ultimate fish oil, Target-released fish oil.
[01:31:27.947 --> 01:31:29.088]  It's got everything in it.
[01:31:29.168 --> 01:31:31.268]  This has got the substitute for the heart and for the brain.
[01:31:31.408 --> 01:31:33.970]  Krill oil is a different formulation, but similar.
[01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.910]  It's excellent as well.
[01:31:35.050 --> 01:31:44.874]  What matters is krill's so small that they still denature and try to get any mercury out, but when they test it, they can't find it anyway, so they still do the process, because krill's so little that it doesn't bioaccumulate.
[01:31:44.894 --> 01:31:46.355]  This is clean, clean, clean.
[01:31:46.435 --> 01:31:47.735]  And then you've got Honor Roll.
[01:31:47.895 --> 01:31:51.217]  This is why it took us a couple years, because I could have instantly private-labeled something.
[01:31:51.257 --> 01:31:51.657]  I said, no.
[01:31:51.917 --> 01:31:59.700]  I want all the oils that are known for the brain to be the very, very best, and I want it at a price way below anybody else, and I want it stronger.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:00.680]  I don't want fillers.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:01.560]  We have done it.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.742]  This baby right here is the nuclear option for your children, you name it.
[01:32:05.902 --> 01:32:09.403]  I mean, you want to give your children the boost they need.
[01:32:09.603 --> 01:32:10.463]  I mean, this is it.
[01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:11.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, just look at it.
[01:32:11.864 --> 01:32:12.344]  Look at that.
[01:32:12.444 --> 01:32:14.325]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[01:32:14.405 --> 01:32:15.805]  That's because it's been denatured.
[01:32:15.825 --> 01:32:16.585]  It's been watered down.
[01:32:17.025 --> 01:32:17.766]  We didn't do that.
[01:32:19.429 --> 01:32:23.542]  You think I would metaphysically sell you something that isn't the very best I can get?
[01:32:23.984 --> 01:32:25.609]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:28.350]  That's for me.
[01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:29.971]  You understand the selfishness of this?
[01:32:30.431 --> 01:32:38.953]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:32:39.033 --> 01:32:40.713]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:32:40.753 --> 01:32:41.833]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:32:41.913 --> 01:32:42.513]  It's a win-win.
[01:32:42.653 --> 01:32:45.714]  You fund us in the face of the enemies that want to shut down your free speech.
[01:32:46.014 --> 01:32:47.855]  By God, I'm on every channel in the country every day.
[01:32:48.115 --> 01:32:49.555]  Destroy me, kill me, shut me up.
[01:32:49.815 --> 01:32:50.115]  Why?
[01:32:50.155 --> 01:32:51.516]  The spirit of the world wants to stop us.
[01:32:51.556 --> 01:32:51.996]  Why is that?
[01:32:52.336 --> 01:32:53.657]  It's because we want justice.
[01:32:53.697 --> 01:32:54.698]  We want freedom.
[01:32:54.718 --> 01:32:57.499]  We don't care what color you are, what gender you are, where you're from.
[01:32:57.519 --> 01:32:58.680]  I want you to have a future.
[01:33:06.204 --> 01:33:08.806]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.162]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:29.682 --> 01:33:31.143]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.723 --> 01:33:34.824]  By the way, Mike Adams helped write the report.
[01:33:35.865 --> 01:33:36.565]  He quarterbacked it.
[01:33:36.645 --> 01:33:39.347]  It was the President and others about shadow banning, as we told you two weeks ago.
[01:33:39.387 --> 01:33:40.567]  Now that's the big top story.
[01:33:41.127 --> 01:33:42.568]  The President's aware, as we told you.
[01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:44.649]  They want to shut down for a reason.
[01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:49.391]  They know the Pentagon, the military, the President, the patriots that are in those groups are listening.
[01:33:49.771 --> 01:33:50.752]  They understand what's happening.
[01:33:52.094 --> 01:33:54.616]  And a lot of them aren't even what I call super right-wing Christians.
[01:33:54.636 --> 01:33:55.897]  They're just not anti-America.
[01:33:56.337 --> 01:33:58.559]  They get the anti-American bent that's going on.
[01:33:58.579 --> 01:33:59.099]  They're upset.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:07.606]  We're talking to Pastor Logan Robertson, who has been so demonized, so misrepresented with what he's done.
[01:34:07.866 --> 01:34:09.107]  Pillarbaptist.org.
[01:34:11.348 --> 01:34:17.373]  There is an Islamic invasion, not just of Australia and New Zealand, but all over the Philippines.
[01:34:18.493 --> 01:34:19.955]  You know, right into Indonesia.
[01:34:20.836 --> 01:34:21.216]  All of it.
[01:34:21.376 --> 01:34:22.958]  It is just massive.
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:26.082]  And so, he's been critical of it.
[01:34:26.242 --> 01:34:36.834]  He went out to a mosque, pointed out Mohammed, married a nine-year-old, and then he was going to another mosque the next day, and the police showed up like he was the devil.
[01:34:37.759 --> 01:34:38.900]  Mohammed married a six-year-old.
[01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:56.232]  He's a pedophile!
[01:34:56.693 --> 01:34:57.854]  What are you trying to achieve, mate?
[01:34:58.234 --> 01:35:00.556]  We're making a documentary about your false religion.
[01:35:00.696 --> 01:35:01.477]  That's what we're trying to do.
[01:35:01.497 --> 01:35:02.198]  What's false about it?
[01:35:02.258 --> 01:35:03.039]  What do you mean by that?
[01:35:03.119 --> 01:35:05.361]  Because they believe in work salvation.
[01:35:05.621 --> 01:35:11.006]  They follow a prophet that was a pedophile that married a six-year-old and consummated that marriage when she was nine.
[01:35:12.085 --> 01:35:12.985]  Nine years old!
[01:35:13.405 --> 01:35:14.726]  That's raping a child!
[01:35:14.746 --> 01:35:15.746]  That's disgusting!
[01:35:16.206 --> 01:35:17.327]  How many wives does he have?
[01:35:17.367 --> 01:35:19.708]  Why didn't he get so angry and raise his voice like that?
[01:35:19.748 --> 01:35:22.308]  He's having a civil conversation with a Muslim.
[01:35:22.368 --> 01:35:22.789]  Hit pause.
[01:35:23.049 --> 01:35:26.670]  Look at these leftist reporter hacks, whether it's in Germany or the U.S.
[01:35:27.010 --> 01:35:28.310]  or Australia, they're all the same.
[01:35:28.330 --> 01:35:29.571]  Just hateful, hateful.
[01:35:29.591 --> 01:35:36.153]  They hate Christians, they hate bitter clingers, but they love to defend the most radical forms of Islam that kills more Muslims than anybody else.
[01:35:37.142 --> 01:35:38.323]  Because I don't hate all Muslims.
[01:35:38.383 --> 01:35:38.924]  I don't... whatever.
[01:35:38.944 --> 01:35:42.266]  The point is the globalists just are absolutely bullying everybody to cover this up.
[01:35:42.547 --> 01:35:42.907]  Continue.
[01:35:44.468 --> 01:35:47.271]  Because I hate the religion of Islam.
[01:35:47.691 --> 01:35:48.772]  I don't hate Muslims.
[01:35:49.072 --> 01:35:50.193]  I hate the religion... Oh, hit pause.
[01:35:50.454 --> 01:35:55.798]  They let Muslims go on and say that Christianity is a false religion, blah blah blah, kill the infidels.
[01:35:55.838 --> 01:35:56.659]  I'm not saying violence.
[01:35:57.019 --> 01:35:58.440]  But then you have stuff like this.
[01:35:58.681 --> 01:35:59.982]  Oh, they'll try to restrict it.
[01:36:01.378 --> 01:36:04.722]  So again, why is the touchstone radical Islam?
[01:36:05.162 --> 01:36:06.443]  Why can't people talk about it?
[01:36:06.483 --> 01:36:07.104]  We'll discuss it.
[01:36:07.284 --> 01:36:11.188]  But whether you agree with this pastor or not, should he then be deported?
[01:36:11.208 --> 01:36:18.515]  I'm not supposed to deport anybody, remember, under the globalist system, for this, out of a British Commonwealth to another, which violates his rights.
[01:36:18.535 --> 01:36:21.438]  But let's just, let's go ahead and finish up with this quote.
[01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:24.418]  Did you call him a terrorist?
[01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:26.180]  I did not call him a terrorist.
[01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:49.557]  Show me the video.
[01:36:49.657 --> 01:36:52.358]  I did not call him a terrorist.
[01:36:52.678 --> 01:36:53.578]  I did not.
[01:36:53.618 --> 01:36:55.019]  So you're lying now.
[01:36:55.239 --> 01:36:58.620]  Show us the video of me calling him a terrorist.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:00.961]  What was your purpose of going to the mosque?
[01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:04.443]  We were setting up interviews for our new documentary.
[01:37:04.463 --> 01:37:04.963]  What documentary?
[01:37:05.003 --> 01:37:08.864]  You don't have permission to go to a private property like you need permission to come here.
[01:37:09.104 --> 01:37:12.226]  You don't have permission to go to a private property.
[01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:15.447]  You don't have permission like it's a police state.
[01:37:16.147 --> 01:37:24.093]  So it goes on from there, the Islamists know they've got the government backing, the media backing, and then after the cameras are cut off, get into what happened next.
[01:37:27.576 --> 01:37:32.340]  After that we left and we got pulled over just around the corner.
[01:37:33.853 --> 01:37:35.974]  They searched our car.
[01:37:36.355 --> 01:37:53.668]  In New Zealand they wouldn't be allowed to do that, but in Australia they searched our car, they took all our camera equipment, and they let us go at that point, after they talked to us and took all our gear.
[01:37:56.687 --> 01:37:59.728]  And then when did you get grabbed and arrested and taken out of the country?
[01:38:01.028 --> 01:38:02.528]  That was the next day.
[01:38:02.948 --> 01:38:10.569]  The next morning I was arrested, taken into the police station for a few hours, and then they let me out.
[01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:13.710]  And they charged me for four different accounts.
[01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:24.672]  Two for public nuisance, one for trespassing on private property, and one for entering in with the intent to steal things from their mosque.
[01:38:25.615 --> 01:38:31.439]  And then I had to walk home from the police station for three hours because they wouldn't give me a ride home.
[01:38:31.459 --> 01:38:32.400]  Well, that's how it works though.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:37.304]  I've noticed under the Commonwealth stuff, it's exponential.
[01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:43.448]  Like, they do one thing, they do another, because they've learned people don't resist if you just keep doing it in waves to them.
[01:38:44.769 --> 01:38:45.450]  Right, yeah.
[01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:50.133]  And then that evening, I got home at roughly 6pm.
[01:38:50.693 --> 01:38:52.575]  I sat down for a meal with my family.
[01:38:53.368 --> 01:39:05.119]  Put the kids to bed, and then about 8 o'clock, Border Patrol storm my house, just take me, handcuff me, take me to their holding cell.
[01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:11.425]  That's right, they won't take all these lamasists and everybody pouring in from North Africa, you name it, just boom.
[01:39:12.006 --> 01:39:13.447]  They don't even get jobs and just run around.
[01:39:13.767 --> 01:39:18.412]  You though, Commonwealth citizen, you are going to be, so the Border Patrol is for you, not them.
[01:39:20.316 --> 01:39:21.077]  Yeah, I believe so.
[01:39:21.277 --> 01:39:27.441]  I mean, in the detention centre, prison that I was in, there was maybe a hundred people there.
[01:39:28.122 --> 01:39:31.804]  There was only maybe one Muslim out of all of them.
[01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:35.447]  Most of them were just New Zealanders getting sent back to New Zealand.
[01:39:36.547 --> 01:39:43.412]  And then also other Commonwealth countries, England, Ireland, so forth.
[01:39:43.592 --> 01:39:44.733]  Well, that's always the story.
[01:39:46.394 --> 01:39:47.916]  Europe's not even for Europeans now.
[01:39:48.516 --> 01:39:49.477]  I mean, that's what we're told.
[01:39:49.557 --> 01:39:49.938]  It's bad.
[01:39:49.958 --> 01:39:53.101]  I mean, they just announced yesterday the U.N.
[01:39:53.141 --> 01:39:55.543]  wants 600 million people to enter the U.S.
[01:39:55.603 --> 01:39:56.444]  in the next 10 years.
[01:39:57.185 --> 01:40:02.390]  And they're going to organize them into the weapons system, a two-to-one vote, to totally enslave everybody.
[01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:04.552]  And it's not even the folks being brought in are bad.
[01:40:04.933 --> 01:40:07.335]  It's that they're being brought in by the globalists, so they're controlled by them.
[01:40:08.176 --> 01:40:09.197]  It's quite a system.
[01:40:10.649 --> 01:40:11.470]  Yeah.
[01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:13.271]  Obviously, I love Muslims.
[01:40:13.351 --> 01:40:23.416]  In fact, yesterday, I gave the Gospel to a Muslim here in the Philippines, and she trusted Jesus as the Savior who believed that He was the Son of God.
[01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:24.657]  So I love Muslims.
[01:40:24.737 --> 01:40:27.439]  It's just, you know, there are a few bad ones out there.
[01:40:27.459 --> 01:40:28.559]  Well, sure.
[01:40:28.799 --> 01:40:32.281]  I mean, the liberals are definitely betting on it.
[01:40:33.302 --> 01:40:34.763]  So you're really committing the big sin, though.
[01:40:34.783 --> 01:40:36.384]  You're actually converting Muslims to Christianity?
[01:40:37.966 --> 01:40:43.173]  Yeah, in fact we've had quite a lot converted in the Philippines, yeah.
[01:40:45.416 --> 01:40:47.579]  So the good news is they're not stopping your message.
[01:40:47.779 --> 01:40:50.903]  Let me guess, do you feel even stronger under this oppression?
[01:40:55.529 --> 01:41:00.812]  I'm mostly sad that it's happening, because I love living there, but on the scheme of things, I'm rejoicing.
[01:41:00.832 --> 01:41:06.556]  The Bible says to, you know, leap of joy when we're persecuted, so I'm happy about it.
[01:41:06.596 --> 01:41:09.798]  I'm sure God's going to turn it into good.
[01:41:12.019 --> 01:41:14.401]  Well, the Philippines is really under Islamic attack.
[01:41:14.441 --> 01:41:17.623]  For folks who don't know, there's killings by Islamists every day in the Philippines.
[01:41:18.003 --> 01:41:19.424]  They're really trying to take that area over.
[01:41:21.383 --> 01:41:26.489]  Yeah, that's on the island of Mindanao, on the South Island.
[01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:32.136]  That's actually where I am right now, where there's a large Muslim population.
[01:41:32.156 --> 01:41:35.160]  And it's martial law here at the moment.
[01:41:36.602 --> 01:41:38.304]  There's checkpoints everywhere.
[01:41:39.607 --> 01:41:55.054]  But, these Muslims have been here for a long time, but they, you know, they're fighting... No, no, out of North Africa, the Middle East, going back 400 years, they had a slave trade on ships all the way out to Indonesia and back.
[01:41:55.074 --> 01:41:56.214]  So, yeah, that's why that's all there.
[01:41:58.735 --> 01:42:01.396]  You know, we learned the transatlantic slave trade from the Islamists.
[01:42:02.737 --> 01:42:02.857]  Yeah.
[01:42:04.034 --> 01:42:05.194]  And look, that's fine.
[01:42:05.895 --> 01:42:07.915]  I just always hear about whites invented slavery.
[01:42:08.055 --> 01:42:08.235]  No.
[01:42:08.595 --> 01:42:13.317]  The modern transatlantic slave trade of 600 years ago was literally learned from Arab slave traders.
[01:42:13.737 --> 01:42:15.037]  And then Europe finally picked it up.
[01:42:16.057 --> 01:42:20.298]  Because slavery wouldn't be accepted in Europe, they would export the slaves to the new world.
[01:42:21.179 --> 01:42:21.939]  So I always hear about...
[01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:31.117]  All the black Muslims join Islam because they think it's anti-slavery, but in all these African countries where the Muslims run things, they have re-instituted slavery.
[01:42:31.397 --> 01:42:32.858]  And they say that blacks are sub-human.
[01:42:33.399 --> 01:42:34.019]  I disagree with that.
[01:42:38.603 --> 01:42:39.404]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:42:39.484 --> 01:42:47.251]  Did you know that, like in North Africa, the Wahhabis say that blacks really aren't human and actually enslave them?
[01:42:49.213 --> 01:42:52.697]  Yeah, I mean, obviously, black people, we love black people as well.
[01:42:53.098 --> 01:42:55.821]  You know, there's no... No, I know you don't.
[01:42:55.941 --> 01:43:01.247]  I'm just saying, under the radical forms of Islam, the Wahhabis, blacks, can be put into slavery.

[01:47:40.369 --> 01:47:40.929]  Thunder.
[01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:45.951]  Thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[01:47:46.311 --> 01:47:47.512]  And we're gonna ride.

[01:47:59.745 --> 01:48:07.191]  See, the devil's behind us.
[01:48:09.913 --> 01:48:11.314]  We are trailblazing into the future.
[01:48:11.875 --> 01:48:13.596]  That's why all the tyrants follow.
[01:48:13.616 --> 01:48:14.577]  They don't lead.
[01:48:16.573 --> 01:48:16.893]  All right.
[01:48:17.714 --> 01:48:19.275]  We have Mike Adams coming in here.
[01:48:19.435 --> 01:48:21.336]  And you know, I'm not good at hyping things.
[01:48:21.376 --> 01:48:21.937]  I'm really not.
[01:48:21.957 --> 01:48:25.959]  I tend to just say things up front, the most powerful stuff with no pomp and circumstance.
[01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:28.081]  But Mike Adams wrote the report.
[01:48:28.481 --> 01:48:29.742]  Paul Watson helped put it out.
[01:48:30.162 --> 01:48:31.463]  We had people get into the president.
[01:48:32.244 --> 01:48:36.907]  Then they shadow banned a bunch of conservative congressmen and women right after we told them it was happening.
[01:48:37.267 --> 01:48:39.628]  They like completely shadow banned them, like 97 percent.
[01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:42.610]  And now Congressman Gates says, I feel violated.
[01:48:42.670 --> 01:48:43.291]  I feel raped.
[01:48:43.791 --> 01:48:44.452]  Good, buddy.
[01:48:44.572 --> 01:48:46.273]  I'm glad you now understand where we're at.
[01:48:48.114 --> 01:48:50.516]  The CNN headline will be, Jones calls for congressmen to be raped.
[01:48:50.576 --> 01:48:51.137]  I'm saying no.
[01:48:51.837 --> 01:48:53.178]  I'm glad you now are awake.
[01:48:54.179 --> 01:48:57.362]  So, we've reached an epic point here.
[01:48:59.063 --> 01:49:04.027]  And we do have the ear of patriots in the government and in corporations.
[01:49:04.968 --> 01:49:06.469]  And a lot of them are intimidated.
[01:49:06.489 --> 01:49:08.090]  A lot of them, you know, are specialists.
[01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:10.052]  They do what they do and they work and they're conformists.
[01:49:10.092 --> 01:49:13.474]  Even though they're not bad people, they're looking for unconformists.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.585]  Like Pastor Robertson, and like you, and like me to do this.
[01:49:18.665 --> 01:49:23.089]  So, I'm going to explain this again, just like everything I keep telling you comes true.
[01:49:23.210 --> 01:49:24.251]  It's not that I'm that smart.
[01:49:24.371 --> 01:49:25.052]  It's formulaic.
[01:49:25.092 --> 01:49:33.601]  In fact, this is so obvious that after they tried to ban us, they tried to ban Tucker Carlson, Fox News, Steven Crowder, Stefan Molyneux.
[01:49:33.641 --> 01:49:33.861]  Why?
[01:49:33.921 --> 01:49:36.364]  Because their listenership is going straight up.
[01:49:40.242 --> 01:49:49.708]  And so, when Tucker Carlson comes out and says, they're trying to ban Alex Jones, they'll ban everybody, they ban Alex Jones, and they all attack him, he knew what they'd do when he did that.
[01:49:50.789 --> 01:49:52.330]  So I respect people that aren't cowards.
[01:49:53.311 --> 01:49:55.853]  And Carlson isn't even doing that for me, he's doing that for his kids.
[01:50:01.696 --> 01:50:06.280]  I mean, Carlson's a patriot, you know, his dad ran Voice for America, you know what that means.
[01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:10.302]  And he knows a real clear and present danger to this country.
[01:50:10.462 --> 01:50:13.905]  And it's only Carlson and maybe a Lou Dobbs and a Sean Hannity.
[01:50:13.925 --> 01:50:19.749]  I mean, Laura Ingrams and people turned against Trump when he met with Putin, which he should have already done.
[01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:24.612]  These people don't have the metal it takes.
[01:50:25.493 --> 01:50:28.216]  We're not all just trying to get a bigger house or a bigger jet airplane.
[01:50:28.656 --> 01:50:30.038]  We will lose everything.
[01:50:30.659 --> 01:50:31.860]  This is a total takeover.
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:32.781]  And I've got the articles.
[01:50:33.161 --> 01:50:42.612]  The moment police try to stop far-right activist Lauren Southern from walking past a mosque in Australia because she might offend Muslims.
[01:50:44.039 --> 01:50:55.990]  There is this leftist, sycophantic worship of radical Islam, and just the most disgusting prostration before it, because it's part of a larger plan.
[01:50:58.512 --> 01:51:06.380]  So, just finishing up with that with Pastor Logan of PillarBaptist.org, watching them gang up on you, watch them do all this, and then watch them
[01:51:08.837 --> 01:51:12.679]  You know, just the things they've done to Australians and New Zealanders, the way they've bullied the population.
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:18.003]  I know they're great people there, but I know they're close to getting control of their governments again.
[01:51:18.023 --> 01:51:19.283]  That's what they're really afraid of.
[01:51:20.724 --> 01:51:24.547]  So I just want to commend the work you've done and appreciate what you're doing.
[01:51:24.567 --> 01:51:29.130]  I hope folks will support you and, you know, get updates from you.
[01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:31.611]  But what else do you want to add?
[01:51:31.631 --> 01:51:33.072]  Do you agree with what I've said?
[01:51:33.112 --> 01:51:33.572]  Disagree?
[01:51:33.592 --> 01:51:37.515]  I mean, what's the essence in your gut, your spirit of what we face?
[01:51:39.141 --> 01:51:43.386]  Yeah, well, I can see there's a big, like you're saying, a censorship of the truth.
[01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:54.200]  Because I've done videos against the Prime Minister of New Zealand, which is a communist, you know, hippie, Jacinda Ardern.
[01:51:54.881 --> 01:51:57.064]  And when I put that video onto YouTube,
[01:51:57.791 --> 01:52:01.272]  No, straight away, the views just, they won't go up at all.
[01:52:01.332 --> 01:52:04.474]  They'll just stay at like 200 to 300 views.
[01:52:04.854 --> 01:52:06.794]  But you can see that people are liking it.
[01:52:07.094 --> 01:52:11.576]  You can see that there's comments, but they won't put the views up at all.
[01:52:11.596 --> 01:52:16.178]  Well, they're shadow banning you because they know their idea is a failed system.
[01:52:16.238 --> 01:52:16.878]  It's oppressive.
[01:52:18.119 --> 01:52:18.539]  Exactly.
[01:52:19.919 --> 01:52:20.099]  Yeah.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:21.700]  And also, like,
[01:52:22.674 --> 01:52:27.075]  There's obviously a big legal battle that we have to now face.
[01:52:27.515 --> 01:52:32.316]  And someone started a GoFundMe account for our church.
[01:52:32.597 --> 01:52:39.878]  It got up to $10,000 and then GoFundMe shut it down because all the left wingers, you know, just kept harassing me.
[01:52:39.898 --> 01:52:45.380]  By the way, everybody always talks about Hitler, Hitler, Hitler, and they overuse it, but Hitler put people in
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.700]  Yes sir, yeah.
[01:53:09.244 --> 01:53:14.729]  Just on my own YouTube and Facebook, they censor it all the time.
[01:53:14.850 --> 01:53:16.071]  They don't want the truth out there.
[01:53:19.781 --> 01:53:21.922]  I hear you're fighting the charges in Australia.
[01:53:24.563 --> 01:53:31.266]  For people that don't know, describe, because I saw the arrogant bearing of the Islamists with the police, the media.
[01:53:31.686 --> 01:53:33.747]  They know they've got the establishment on their side.
[01:53:34.367 --> 01:53:39.509]  How are the Muslims taking it, knowing the full might of the West is here to help them like a knife, draw them across our neck?
[01:53:41.392 --> 01:53:52.300]  I'm not sure how they are, but with the three other men in our church, I couldn't go to court because I was deported, so they put a warrant out for my arrest now in Australia.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:54:00.767]  Now, the other three men, their plea to not guilty is also going to cost a lot of money to fight this, but the lawyer said that
[01:54:01.559 --> 01:54:03.820]  These charges are not from the police.
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:08.202]  They're from higher up in government, because the police would never charge you for these things normally.
[01:54:08.262 --> 01:54:09.542]  But they still need to pay for it.
[01:54:09.582 --> 01:54:13.004]  I mean, the real people on trial should be the magistrates that took part in this criminal activity.
[01:54:14.664 --> 01:54:15.025]  Right, yeah.
[01:54:15.065 --> 01:54:20.687]  I mean, I don't know why we have to end up paying for, you know, all our legal costs.
[01:54:21.787 --> 01:54:23.108]  If the media never turned up,
[01:54:24.002 --> 01:54:25.343]  Then none of this would have happened.
[01:54:25.403 --> 01:54:26.564]  I'd still be in Australia.
[01:54:26.665 --> 01:54:27.325]  Everything would be fine.
[01:54:27.345 --> 01:54:27.866]  Well, exactly.
[01:54:27.886 --> 01:54:28.506]  They showed up.
[01:54:28.526 --> 01:54:28.867]  The police.
[01:54:28.947 --> 01:54:29.868]  Everybody wanted to grovel.
[01:54:30.929 --> 01:54:31.729]  But see, that's the issue.
[01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:36.494]  As Thomas Jefferson said, when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:54:36.514 --> 01:54:38.475]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[01:54:39.523 --> 01:54:49.966]  And the fact that they would take peaceful pastors coming to cover a news thing that were invited to a mosque, the mosque is inviting you in, the fact that they would do all this shows the true criminal activity.
[01:54:50.566 --> 01:54:53.467]  Pillarbaptist.org, people should go there, find out more what you're doing.
[01:54:54.127 --> 01:54:55.307]  We look forward to talking to you again, Pastor.
[01:54:55.347 --> 01:54:55.747]  God bless.
[01:54:57.108 --> 01:54:57.428]  Thank you.
[01:54:58.368 --> 01:55:06.010]  And again, whether you agree or disagree with what the media has said about this guy, and I find it all to be a misrepresentation, you should support the free speech issue in all of this.
[01:55:07.168 --> 01:55:17.531]  Now, I haven't gotten all the footage that we have today that's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com of patriots being attacked by leftists all over the country.
[01:55:17.591 --> 01:55:21.532]  It is exponentially getting worse right now.
[01:55:21.552 --> 01:55:22.473]  And it is racial.
[01:55:22.733 --> 01:55:23.773]  I love Hispanic people.
[01:55:24.533 --> 01:55:25.393]  I love white people.
[01:55:25.533 --> 01:55:26.154]  We're all the same.
[01:55:26.174 --> 01:55:29.475]  I mean, you could technically argue because I'm like a little bit Native American.
[01:55:29.495 --> 01:55:32.235]  Hispanic, Hispaniola is just the island that's
[01:55:34.611 --> 01:55:39.656]  Now Dominican Republic and Haiti was called Hispaniola and then 500 years ago was sugarcane plantation.
[01:55:39.696 --> 01:55:42.679]  So if you were like somebody out of that, they would call you Hispanic.
[01:55:44.581 --> 01:55:45.742]  Latino would be a better term.
[01:55:45.762 --> 01:55:47.704]  It just means Latin language, but it doesn't matter.
[01:55:49.206 --> 01:55:50.227]  The point is, is that
[01:55:52.552 --> 01:55:59.674]  I find Latinos and people, if you could actually talk to them, easier to wake up to what's going on than most groups on average.
[01:55:59.734 --> 01:56:02.055]  I don't want to make those groups an enemy.
[01:56:02.295 --> 01:56:02.935]  They've had the kids.
[01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:03.795]  They didn't deport their kids.
[01:56:03.815 --> 01:56:04.335]  They're good people.
[01:56:04.355 --> 01:56:05.396]  They're the future of America.
[01:56:05.676 --> 01:56:07.356]  So let's not make them enemies.
[01:56:08.016 --> 01:56:14.458]  But I've got a good hundred videos I've seen where you get a group of Hispanic people beating up white folks, beating up women, you name it.
[01:56:14.498 --> 01:56:19.580]  And I mean, you know, I would be really offended if I saw a bunch of white people beating up Hispanics or vice versa.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:26.522]  Hispanics are, you know, white and Native American and sometimes a little bit of mix of African in there.
[01:56:26.702 --> 01:56:35.584]  So, you know, we're all the same people and it's just really stupid and it's dumb and we're gonna lose this fight against the globalists if we're fighting with each other over this crap.
[01:56:35.604 --> 01:56:44.267]  But these folks have been told that Donald Trump hates them and so they go out to the Donald Trump star and, you know, they see guys in American flags and they attack them.
[01:56:45.243 --> 01:56:49.765]  And it's just total idiocy and pathetic.
[01:56:50.806 --> 01:56:58.829]  And it's all being planned towards this fall for a big crisis, and that's why they want to censor those of us that are exposing it, because they want this to take place.
[01:56:58.849 --> 01:57:06.813]  So the country is in grave danger, and I can sit up here with a nice smile about all this and everything, but you don't just think Trump getting in was the beginning of the victory.
[01:57:07.934 --> 01:57:09.354]  That's not going to happen unless we take action.
[01:57:09.955 --> 01:57:12.236]  Trump winning was not the victory, it was the beginning.
[01:57:13.584 --> 01:57:18.548]  And the globalists now are awake, they're making their move, and it's very sad to watch them.
[01:57:19.149 --> 01:57:28.677]  In the footage I've got of black people beating up white people in California yesterday, and Hispanics attacking whites, and just believing it's okay because you like America, F America.
[01:57:29.017 --> 01:57:33.861]  How they were trained to hate the country they want to be part of is the mind control, the essence of evil.
[01:57:34.281 --> 01:57:39.284]  Please don't forget we've got the new amazing krill oil, fish oil, and roll call for children.
[01:57:39.925 --> 01:57:42.426]  Talk about brain boost, stamina, health, everything.
[01:57:42.446 --> 01:57:43.627]  These are the very best out there.
[01:57:43.667 --> 01:57:45.128]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:45.308 --> 01:57:47.029]  25% off without you will be shut down.

[01:57:52.483 --> 01:57:57.887]  Two and a half years ago, Hillary Clinton dubbed myself and InfoWars as fake news.
[01:57:58.468 --> 01:58:10.738]  Since then, the Democrats in Congress, CNN, MSNBC, have all lobbied to keep me from publishing books, to have us kicked offline from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and they've had some success.
[01:58:11.298 --> 01:58:19.966]  Not only are they the real fake news, and working for the Communist Chinese and others to overthrow this country, they're also working to destroy the First Amendment here in America.
[01:58:20.586 --> 01:58:24.611]  But here at InfoWars, we've been expanding on radio and TV, thanks to your support.
[01:58:24.992 --> 01:58:29.978]  And we've launched a new, powerful, free app called InfoWars Official.
[01:58:30.218 --> 01:58:37.908]  InfoWars Official is a state-of-the-art app with live streaming of podcasts, my broadcast, David Knight's show.
[01:58:38.268 --> 01:58:44.330]  The War Room with Roger Stone and Owen Schroyer and so many other broadcasts that we're launching as we speak.
[01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:47.031]  It's got live news feeds, live news alerts.
[01:58:47.271 --> 01:58:52.432]  It's got push notifications if you click to get them so you know we go live or have special events.
[01:58:52.572 --> 01:58:53.853]  This is the forbidden now.
[01:58:54.273 --> 01:58:55.513]  This is what they demonize.
[01:58:55.753 --> 01:58:57.354]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:58:57.794 --> 01:58:58.674]  Think for yourselves.
[01:58:58.734 --> 01:59:05.516]  Go find out why InfoWars is so verboten and why the system openly is lobbying to have us shut down.
[01:59:06.037 --> 01:59:12.736]  Every enemy of capitalism, every enemy of America, every globalist corporation hates InfoWars for one reason.
[01:59:14.699 --> 01:59:15.359]  We're good to go.
[01:59:36.385 --> 01:59:38.106]  Here's what the globalists want shut down.
[01:59:38.366 --> 01:59:41.429]  Here's what they don't want you to hear, read, and see.
[01:59:41.809 --> 01:59:45.732]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalists at point-blank range.
[01:59:45.932 --> 01:59:50.095]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:59:56.379 --> 02:00:00.342]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:14.634 --> 02:00:19.061]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.512 --> 02:00:30.515]  You know, the attempted takedown of free speech is happening right now.
[02:00:31.415 --> 02:00:38.381]  And the left thinks we're so brain-dead and so in a catatonic state watching TV and watching football or whatever that we don't know they banned.
[02:00:38.441 --> 02:00:39.763]  Christians, conservatives everywhere.
[02:00:39.803 --> 02:00:43.346]  They're moving forward with giant riot gangs, martial law plans.
[02:00:44.527 --> 02:00:45.908]  It's quite a time to be alive.
[02:00:45.928 --> 02:00:48.570]  They're about to grab Julian Assange and put him in prison in the U.S.
[02:00:49.531 --> 02:00:50.532]  I mean, you know, this is real.
[02:00:50.572 --> 02:00:51.433]  This isn't a joke.
[02:00:51.513 --> 02:00:52.894]  It's not a drill.
[02:00:54.195 --> 02:00:54.836]  It's the real deal.
[02:00:55.951 --> 02:00:58.053]  And they want to break this country financially.
[02:00:58.073 --> 02:00:59.494]  They want to bring in total division.
[02:00:59.854 --> 02:01:03.216]  They want to teach cultural division, the opposite of Martin Luther King and schools.
[02:01:03.676 --> 02:01:06.138]  They want to betray the real Christian revolution this country's seen.
[02:01:06.758 --> 02:01:10.401]  CNN lies about banned InfoWars videos, a new censorship attempt.
[02:01:10.901 --> 02:01:12.142]  See the banned videos for yourself.
[02:01:12.282 --> 02:01:12.943]  Go read the article.
[02:01:12.963 --> 02:01:16.585]  You can also sign a petition to stop shadow banning that is having an effect in Congress.
[02:01:16.605 --> 02:01:18.366]  So you've got to do some effort, you know.
[02:01:18.386 --> 02:01:20.888]  Go get the article and go there and do it.
[02:01:22.829 --> 02:01:24.471]  Some other things we're trying as hard as we can to do.
[02:01:27.756 --> 02:01:49.612]  You have to understand, this isn't just spectator stuff, and I know you know that, but if we're sitting here talking to you, and we're talking about all the things that need to be done, if you don't share the articles, if you don't download the free app, InfoWars.com forward slash app, if you don't tell people about the app, if you don't tell them about the verboten nature of the show, and that, hey, they're trying to shut this down, people won't understand what's happening, the enemy will win.
[02:01:51.933 --> 02:01:55.436]  And scumbags like Brian Stelter,
[02:01:56.923 --> 02:01:57.704]  He thinks you're weak.
[02:01:58.365 --> 02:02:07.876]  He's a little weak, twisted, evil person spiritually, but he has the energy to dominate, and he thinks it's a big joke that he sees more superior men and women under his control.
[02:02:07.916 --> 02:02:12.462]  He can't believe that he's having such a heyday with you, and it's only because you've been unconscious.
[02:02:15.691 --> 02:02:20.514]  Let's go out a little Mayberry piece here, then we'll come back from break with Mike Adams, who is taking action.
[02:02:20.554 --> 02:02:21.875]  We really appreciate Mike.
[02:02:21.915 --> 02:02:22.616]  He took action.
[02:02:22.636 --> 02:02:23.376]  He wrote the report.
[02:02:23.677 --> 02:02:24.317]  Paul got it out.
[02:02:24.337 --> 02:02:25.118]  It got to the President.
[02:02:25.158 --> 02:02:27.039]  Now the domino's almost falling.
[02:02:27.059 --> 02:02:28.760]  We've almost got the censorship exposed.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:30.381]  We're almost going to rout these people.
[02:02:30.421 --> 02:02:41.049]  But without you promoting it, and God, without me manning up my organizational skills, our crap, and getting the full force out, because we've got the enemy's destruction in our hand, but we don't launch it.
[02:02:41.289 --> 02:02:42.910]  We just don't deliver it down the pike.
[02:02:43.591 --> 02:02:44.311]  We will do it, though.
[02:02:44.371 --> 02:02:44.811]  God help me.
[02:02:48.248 --> 02:02:49.229]  The British are coming!
[02:02:49.249 --> 02:02:50.329]  The British are coming!
[02:02:52.070 --> 02:03:09.561]  Now the ride of Paul Revere Set the nation on its ear And the shock that Lexington heard round the world When the British fired in the early dawn The war of independence had begun The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled
[02:03:11.284 --> 02:03:15.467]  And on to Concord, marched the Pole, to seize the Arsenal, there you know.
[02:03:15.868 --> 02:03:18.710]  Wakin' folks, searchin' all around.
[02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:27.836]  Till our militias stopped them in their tracks, at the old North Bridge, we turned them back, and chased those Redcoats back to Boston Town.
[02:03:29.017 --> 02:03:33.180]  And the shock around the world, was the start of a revolution.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:36.483]  The big men were ready, on the move.
[02:03:46.757 --> 02:03:54.044]  It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over here, that they'd put a light up in this high church steeple.
[02:03:54.804 --> 02:03:56.206]  And Paul went down there to look.
[02:03:56.906 --> 02:03:58.968]  And sure enough, there was the light.
[02:04:01.348 --> 02:04:04.450]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out.
[02:04:04.890 --> 02:04:07.732]  He didn't know where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[02:04:08.132 --> 02:04:09.313]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[02:04:09.593 --> 02:04:17.978]  That old horse with his ears laid back and his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine, feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[02:04:18.318 --> 02:04:21.660]  Paul holding on for dear life and hollering at the top of his lungs.
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:23.521]  He says, the British is coming!
[02:04:23.561 --> 02:04:24.561]  The British is coming!
[02:04:24.841 --> 02:04:27.303]  Get your gun, we're gonna have us a revolution!
[02:04:28.129 --> 02:04:32.132]  And them farmers come a-piling out of the hay like bees out of a beehive.
[02:04:32.713 --> 02:04:33.914]  Minute men, they's called.
[02:04:34.094 --> 02:04:34.854]  What's minute men?
[02:04:35.335 --> 02:04:35.875]  Minute men?
[02:04:36.435 --> 02:04:38.557]  They's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[02:04:38.857 --> 02:04:46.043]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns and head out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[02:05:03.021 --> 02:05:09.426]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:05:09.506 --> 02:05:16.331]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:05:16.351 --> 02:05:31.883]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:05:32.955 --> 02:05:36.658]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:05:36.818 --> 02:05:41.881]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:05:42.041 --> 02:05:43.182]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:43.362 --> 02:05:44.983]  It is absolutely free.
[02:05:45.183 --> 02:05:50.167]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:05:50.407 --> 02:05:54.269]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:05:54.349 --> 02:05:58.272]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[02:05:58.472 --> 02:06:02.595]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:18.591]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.464 --> 02:06:37.437]  It was back on May 29th that Roseanne Barr made the tweet about Valerie Jarrett that put a screeching halt to her mega successful reboot that gave a voice to middle America.
[02:06:37.477 --> 02:06:42.103]  And I was so sad that people thought it was racist.
[02:06:42.863 --> 02:06:52.348]  And then I went into the whole thing about the whole discussion of racism and that blew my mind because it's so much a part of what the show I was doing was about.
[02:06:52.988 --> 02:06:55.410]  And I'm like, why can they not see my work?
[02:06:56.130 --> 02:07:06.916]  And then I got really messed up thinking, in this world, it seems as if words matter more than actions, but in the real life world, actions matter more than words.
[02:07:07.116 --> 02:07:11.058]  And my actions over 30 years as an artist and a comedian,
[02:07:11.878 --> 02:07:15.701]  I've always been... You know, I love this.
[02:07:16.661 --> 02:07:23.005]  We've got all these videos out there just of the left screaming N-word at the ICE people, all the rest of it.
[02:07:23.306 --> 02:07:26.108]  The craziest race-baiting, white people are inherently evil.
[02:07:26.448 --> 02:07:36.875]  And then Roseanne Barr says that he's a Nazi collaborator, George Soros, and then she's got to apologize and she goes on Hannity to fall on her sword over some stupid sitcom that a bunch of zombies watch.
[02:07:37.998 --> 02:07:39.019]  I mean, I'm just sick of it.
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:43.304]  But here's the big article that went out a week and a half ago that got picked up.
[02:07:43.765 --> 02:07:46.468]  Now you see the president saying shadow banning is illegal.
[02:07:46.848 --> 02:07:47.850]  He's going to investigate it.
[02:07:48.110 --> 02:07:51.674]  Congressman Gates has gone from supporting it a week ago to saying it's terrible.
[02:07:51.714 --> 02:07:52.555]  He feels violated.
[02:07:52.936 --> 02:07:56.339]  Emergency big text plot to kill free speech revealed?
[02:07:57.500 --> 02:07:59.741]  We're going to retweet that at Real Alex Jones because they hate it.
[02:08:00.182 --> 02:08:04.584]  And then there is the master censorship plan decoded that Mike Adams put together.
[02:08:05.124 --> 02:08:06.505]  And it's 50-something pages.
[02:08:06.565 --> 02:08:07.406]  It got to the president.
[02:08:07.726 --> 02:08:10.307]  So Mike, now, I know for a fact it got to the president.
[02:08:10.908 --> 02:08:14.910]  You see a week and a half later, he's saying yesterday it's illegal, the shadow ban.
[02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:18.252]  So at least we're forcing it out in the open, what they've been doing.
[02:08:18.872 --> 02:08:23.575]  They were so arrogant to put shadow bans on all the Republicans, even though they have voting power.
[02:08:24.375 --> 02:08:27.878]  They've now begun to back off of that, at least on the surface.
[02:08:27.898 --> 02:08:30.921]  We know they'll creep back in later, but this is a big deal.
[02:08:30.941 --> 02:08:31.682]  Thanks for coming in with us.
[02:08:31.882 --> 02:08:32.402]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:08:32.462 --> 02:08:33.243]  Thanks for having me here.
[02:08:33.764 --> 02:08:42.271]  And what's extraordinary about what's happening today is that Twitter now is denying that they're shadowbanning the president, even as they are shadowbanning the president.
[02:08:42.972 --> 02:08:50.995]  They're saying that they're not shadowbanning anybody, but you just can't find their tweets unless you go directly to their page and look for them really, really hard.
[02:08:51.275 --> 02:08:52.296]  That's shadowbanning.
[02:08:52.696 --> 02:08:54.977]  That's, I mean, hey Jack, that's shadowbanning.
[02:08:55.377 --> 02:08:56.678]  They're in a state of denial, Alex.
[02:08:56.998 --> 02:09:06.802]  And the thing is, here's what really hit me in the last couple of days in listening to your show and going through some of what I've experienced, is that these people on the left, these tech giants,
[02:09:07.262 --> 02:09:17.894]  They are part of what they want to be a cultocracy, a cult of fanaticism, and they absolutely will not stop unless they are forced to stop.
[02:09:18.134 --> 02:09:20.097]  And they're manned by a bunch of SJWs.
[02:09:20.137 --> 02:09:21.258]  They defame us.
[02:09:21.398 --> 02:09:22.139]  It's not about us.
[02:09:22.199 --> 02:09:27.703]  But they defame me, say things I didn't say, remove the videos, and then Facebook identically does the same thing.
[02:09:28.004 --> 02:09:28.604]  Well, this is the other thing.
[02:09:28.824 --> 02:09:33.428]  The ACLU should give you an award for being a champion of freedom of speech.
[02:09:33.448 --> 02:09:34.729]  Where's the ACLU on all this?
[02:09:35.049 --> 02:09:36.691]  You know, where's Jeff Sessions on all this?
[02:09:37.031 --> 02:09:41.515]  The thing is, America owes you a debt of gratitude, frankly, for standing up for the freedom of speech.
[02:09:41.555 --> 02:09:51.623]  Because if they take out Alex Jones, and they falsely accuse you like they did with that video, they said that you pushed a child down, wasn't even you in the video, and then they ban your right to defend yourself.
[02:09:52.103 --> 02:09:57.647]  If they take you out, then they're going to take out Fox News, then they're going to take out all conservative lawmakers.
[02:09:57.667 --> 02:09:58.948]  And by the way, they're already saying that.
[02:09:58.988 --> 02:10:00.129]  They're like thumbing at the mouth.
[02:10:00.409 --> 02:10:07.195]  What do you make, though, of Anderson Cooper having 4,000 viewers when he did this $18 million push on Facebook?
[02:10:07.255 --> 02:10:09.376]  They pushed notification to everybody and no one tuned in.
[02:10:09.696 --> 02:10:13.219]  Don't they get that even if they were to ban us everywhere, people still hate them?
[02:10:13.399 --> 02:10:13.940]  Well, this is the thing.
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:16.922]  The only way that they can even have a voice that's relevant in the
[02:10:17.262 --> 02:10:17.982]  We're good to go.
[02:10:35.689 --> 02:10:38.070]  Paul Joseph Watson, his ideas make sense.
[02:10:38.290 --> 02:10:38.850]  He wins.
[02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:39.930]  You win.
[02:10:40.090 --> 02:10:40.570]  We win.
[02:10:41.050 --> 02:10:48.632]  And if we can simply defend ourselves against the false accusations, then we can set the record straight, and then maybe- Well, that's the real answer here, Ish.
[02:10:48.652 --> 02:10:48.912]  Yeah.
[02:10:49.753 --> 02:10:59.555]  They are misrepresenting who we are, building straw men, then silencing us so we can't respond to their fraud, and they're moving against everybody for civil unrest in the new year.
[02:11:00.655 --> 02:11:02.756]  They are moving towards
[02:11:05.171 --> 02:11:07.412]  The midterms, they're planning something big.
[02:11:07.452 --> 02:11:09.773]  They wouldn't be calculating like that.
[02:11:09.813 --> 02:11:10.173]  Exactly.
[02:11:10.293 --> 02:11:12.773]  They wouldn't be doing something this risky if they didn't have something big planned.
[02:11:12.833 --> 02:11:19.555]  Remember that Robert Mueller charged I think 12 or 13 Russians with attempting to defraud the United States of America by interfering with elections.
[02:11:20.095 --> 02:11:21.456]  What is it that Twitter is doing?
[02:11:21.716 --> 02:11:22.416]  Facebook, Google.
[02:11:22.696 --> 02:11:27.437]  They are doing what the Russians never did, but that Robert Mueller accused the Russians of doing.
[02:11:27.738 --> 02:11:28.858]  Facebook is doing it every day.
[02:11:29.358 --> 02:11:30.259]  Twitter is doing it every day.
[02:11:30.339 --> 02:11:32.200]  They are defrauding the United States of America.
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:36.182]  And frankly, Alex, they are shredding, they are ripping apart the culture of this country.
[02:11:36.522 --> 02:11:39.964]  They are going to push us into an escalation that we want to avoid.
[02:11:39.984 --> 02:11:44.086]  That they are pushing it because they have declared a kind of war.
[02:11:44.166 --> 02:11:47.288]  This is the opening salvo of warfare against the American people.
[02:11:47.328 --> 02:11:49.709]  They are disenfranchising half the population.
[02:11:50.630 --> 02:11:52.311]  I can't believe I'm more animated right now than you are.
[02:11:52.351 --> 02:11:54.172]  No, no, I'm just trying to shut up or I'll go wild.
[02:11:54.532 --> 02:11:55.212]  No, you're right, Mike.
[02:11:55.412 --> 02:11:56.353]  But here's the thing.
[02:11:57.768 --> 02:12:05.431]  It's just so crazy that they're doing this and they're pulling out all the stops, and the good news is no one's watching them.
[02:12:05.931 --> 02:12:06.551]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:12:06.591 --> 02:12:07.411]  There's no oversight.
[02:12:07.891 --> 02:12:13.953]  And like I said, they have decided in their minds that they absolutely will not stop unless you make them stop.
[02:12:14.254 --> 02:12:18.255]  And that could be done by federal marshals, it could be done by federal regulation.
[02:12:18.775 --> 02:12:21.336]  Maybe the president, you know, can initiate some action?
[02:12:21.356 --> 02:12:29.859]  Well, that's the beginning, pulling their security clearances, when you've got Clapper and all these guys in the Chai Com Payroll on record saying, overthrow the government, go after conservatives.
[02:12:30.159 --> 02:12:31.379]  I mean, they're clearly seditious.
[02:12:31.399 --> 02:12:34.340]  They're not trying to work within the government or the system.
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:36.481]  They're trying to overthrow the election.
[02:12:36.881 --> 02:12:38.722]  You can't reason with these tech giants.
[02:12:38.982 --> 02:12:39.862]  You can't reason with them.
[02:12:40.322 --> 02:12:48.027]  There is no circumstance under which they will voluntarily recreate a level playing field of ideas that will not happen.
[02:12:48.387 --> 02:12:49.628]  This is what we must understand.
[02:12:49.968 --> 02:12:51.889]  You can't appease them, Representative Gates.
[02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:54.251]  You can't appease these tyrants.
[02:12:54.291 --> 02:12:55.872]  They are authoritarian cultists.
[02:12:56.352 --> 02:12:57.433]  And they are fanatics.
[02:12:57.913 --> 02:12:59.454]  They are driven by their fanaticism.
[02:12:59.514 --> 02:13:03.116]  It's like a jihad against the freedom of speech in this country.
[02:13:03.157 --> 02:13:04.377]  That's what the left is doing today.
[02:13:04.597 --> 02:13:05.558]  That's the only way to describe it.
[02:13:05.578 --> 02:13:05.998]  Well, that's it.
[02:13:06.138 --> 02:13:08.600]  This is the huge move against the First Amendment.
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:10.221]  Yes, a huge move against everything.
[02:13:10.261 --> 02:13:11.221]  It's happening now.
[02:13:11.701 --> 02:13:15.963]  And I can't even get conservatives to halfway wake up or even figure anything out.
[02:13:16.003 --> 02:13:19.705]  Because they were always censoring us and things, but that was lulling us in.
[02:13:19.765 --> 02:13:21.245]  It was kind of low level.
[02:13:21.286 --> 02:13:22.446]  Now it's exponential.
[02:13:22.466 --> 02:13:23.366]  This is the main assault.
[02:13:24.087 --> 02:13:27.388]  And Congressman Gates, we know he got the report.
[02:13:27.428 --> 02:13:28.389]  We know he got talked to.
[02:13:29.529 --> 02:13:31.530]  People asking him to be a champion against shadow banning.
[02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.610]  This is wrong.
[02:13:32.710 --> 02:13:34.071]  And Roger Stone talked to him.
[02:13:34.091 --> 02:13:35.832]  Roger Stone got him to run for office and helped him out.
[02:13:37.328 --> 02:13:42.575]  And Roger's mad at him right now because Gates got in the hearing and said, well you're a private corporation, you can do whatever you want.
[02:13:42.695 --> 02:13:42.955]  Really?
[02:13:43.195 --> 02:13:46.860]  Like AT&T can keep you from calling your mom on the phone?
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:50.385]  So until he got shadow banned, now he says he feels violated.
[02:13:51.092 --> 02:13:51.732]  Yeah, right, right.
[02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:27.276]  LGBT people, or African-American groups, imagine the outcry if this was done for nothing.
[02:14:27.296 --> 02:14:34.423]  But it's Christians and conservatives and Trump supporters and nationalists, and then it's tanking Facebook's stock, because people get, they're all leaving, it's falling apart.
[02:14:34.623 --> 02:14:39.328]  They're killing the NFL, they're killing Hollywood, they're killing Facebook on the altar of defeating us.
[02:14:39.648 --> 02:14:43.532]  Don't they get that we weren't going to change our view just so we could be promoted on Facebook?
[02:14:43.632 --> 02:14:51.998]  They thought Pavlovianly to get their casino gulag chips, we would roll over to their ideology in the last few years, and they can't believe Mike and their social engineering.
[02:14:52.219 --> 02:14:54.080]  That's the big victory, that we rejected it!
[02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:55.061]  Yeah, right, right.
[02:14:55.261 --> 02:15:02.406]  Well, that's why they're so desperate at this point, because they know that the spirit of freedom and liberty is rising up in the hearts and minds of the American people.
[02:15:02.726 --> 02:15:12.374]  And we will not be silenced, and we will not acquiesce to their twisted, distorted, delusional view of the world, this left-wing cultism, where they say, you know, a biological man
[02:15:12.814 --> 02:15:20.999]  Should be able to declare himself a woman and beat women in the face on a mat in a high school wrestling team and win the state championship because he says he's a woman.
[02:15:21.379 --> 02:15:22.199]  We reject that!
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:28.343]  We reject that because we are rooted in logic and reason and reality, economic reality, biological reality.
[02:15:28.363 --> 02:15:36.408]  But I agree, but I mean when you've got millions of push notifications, Facebook hyping for weeks, Anderson Cooper's show, and it has 4.4 thousand viewers.
[02:15:37.108 --> 02:15:38.309]  I mean dude, you could...
[02:15:38.869 --> 02:15:39.630]  They can't compete.
[02:15:39.850 --> 02:15:40.350]  That's the thing.
[02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:42.431]  But Simon, that, it's like no one will watch that.
[02:15:42.571 --> 02:15:45.093]  No, because people... Drying paint would have more viewers.
[02:15:45.353 --> 02:15:52.037]  The human spirit is rejecting the delusional fanaticism of the left, and that's why their censorship has gone ballistic.
[02:15:52.898 --> 02:15:53.398]  No, you're right.
[02:15:53.438 --> 02:15:56.980]  It's a total... We're allergic to the left now.
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:15:58.141]  Good way to put it.
[02:15:58.501 --> 02:15:59.562]  We're allergic to CNN.
[02:15:59.602 --> 02:16:01.483]  I don't know, I've got a huge allergy.
[02:16:04.588 --> 02:16:07.589]  I don't sell snake oil, I sell fish oil.
[02:16:08.549 --> 02:16:10.610]  And some of the cleanest, most concentrated out there.
[02:16:12.810 --> 02:16:15.171]  There's one thing I take every day and that's fish oil.
[02:16:15.371 --> 02:16:21.253]  And so, this has been a couple years in the making because I wasn't just going to go out to one of the big suppliers.
[02:16:21.493 --> 02:16:24.194]  It already cost a lot to have them do the process where it removes the mercury.
[02:16:24.534 --> 02:16:26.134]  We have it at non-detectable levels.
[02:16:26.214 --> 02:16:31.216]  Some spectrometers might pick up a molecule of it or something under California standards, so we don't say mercury-free.
[02:16:31.256 --> 02:16:34.957]  But it's basically the cleanest fish oil, krill oil, you name it, there is.
[02:16:35.377 --> 02:16:36.697]  Because, you know, we don't get it from tuna.
[02:16:36.717 --> 02:16:38.177]  We get it from small fish and things like that.
[02:16:38.197 --> 02:16:39.178]  So it doesn't bioaccumulate.
[02:16:39.218 --> 02:16:40.938]  Then they have a program that extracts it out.
[02:16:40.998 --> 02:16:44.159]  But that's the only negative to fish oil and krill oil and things.
[02:16:44.299 --> 02:16:49.120]  We have stuff that, from the top firms in the country, ultimate krill oil, on a roll for your children.
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:53.324]  Ultimate fish oil that are so game-changing, it's insane.
[02:16:53.424 --> 02:16:59.330]  I mean, these are big glass bottles with two-month supplies for the price right below leading competitors.
[02:16:59.550 --> 02:17:04.695]  So, X2 is the only thing that gives you the dramatic results that I, within just days, that I've seen with these.
[02:17:04.875 --> 02:17:06.497]  This baby's filled right to the top.
[02:17:06.637 --> 02:17:06.977]  Look at that.
[02:17:07.057 --> 02:17:08.999]  I mean, that's as strong as it gets, by the way, too.
[02:17:09.079 --> 02:17:09.940]  Look at those horse pills.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.423]  That right there is liquid fuel for the brain, your heart, your whole body.
[02:17:13.463 --> 02:17:14.224]  That is magic.
[02:17:18.967 --> 02:17:22.409]  Because I said I want the cleanest, strongest there is.
[02:17:22.529 --> 02:17:24.709]  Because I want to give you what I'm going to take.
[02:17:24.769 --> 02:17:27.310]  So, Ultimate Fish Oil, Target Release Fish Oil.
[02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:28.631]  It's got everything in it.
[02:17:28.711 --> 02:17:30.812]  This has got the substitute for the heart and for the brain.
[02:17:30.952 --> 02:17:33.533]  Krill Oil is a different formulation, but similar.
[02:17:33.553 --> 02:17:34.453]  It's excellent as well.
[02:17:34.593 --> 02:17:39.095]  What matters is krill's so small that they still denature and try to get any mercury out.
[02:17:39.135 --> 02:17:41.756]  But when they test it, they can't find it anyway, so they still do the process.
[02:17:41.776 --> 02:17:44.417]  Because krill's so little that it doesn't bioaccumulate.
[02:17:44.437 --> 02:17:45.897]  This is clean, clean, clean.
[02:17:45.957 --> 02:17:47.238]  And then you've got Honor Roll.
[02:17:47.418 --> 02:17:50.743]  This is why it took us a couple years, because I could have instantly private-labeled something.
[02:17:50.783 --> 02:17:59.256]  I said, no, I want all the oils that are known for the brain to be the very, very best, and I want it at a price way below anybody else, and I want it stronger.
[02:17:59.376 --> 02:18:00.238]  I don't want fillers.
[02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.119]  We have done it.
[02:18:01.319 --> 02:18:02.381]  This baby right here.
[02:18:04.838 --> 02:18:05.278]  You name it.
[02:18:05.418 --> 02:18:08.921]  I mean, you want to give your children the boost they need.
[02:18:09.121 --> 02:18:09.981]  I mean, this is it.
[02:18:10.002 --> 02:18:11.322]  Ladies and gentlemen, just look at it.
[02:18:11.402 --> 02:18:11.883]  Look at that.
[02:18:11.903 --> 02:18:13.864]  Everybody else is just, like, yellow or clear.
[02:18:13.924 --> 02:18:15.325]  That's because it's been denatured.
[02:18:15.345 --> 02:18:16.126]  It's been watered down.
[02:18:16.546 --> 02:18:17.346]  We didn't do that.
[02:18:18.988 --> 02:18:23.090]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[02:18:23.491 --> 02:18:25.132]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[02:18:27.281 --> 02:18:27.881]  That's for me.
[02:18:27.901 --> 02:18:29.483]  You understand the selfishness of this?
[02:18:29.963 --> 02:18:38.490]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:40.251]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[02:18:40.291 --> 02:18:41.372]  Don't you get the big secret?
[02:18:41.472 --> 02:18:42.052]  It's a win-win.
[02:18:42.192 --> 02:18:45.275]  You fund us in the face of the enemies that want to shut down your free speech.
[02:18:45.555 --> 02:18:47.417]  By God, I'm on every channel in the country every day.
[02:18:47.657 --> 02:18:49.098]  Destroy me, kill me, shut me up.
[02:18:49.338 --> 02:18:49.579]  Why?
[02:18:49.599 --> 02:18:51.062]  The spirit of the world wants to stop us.
[02:18:51.102 --> 02:18:51.523]  Why is that?
[02:18:51.864 --> 02:18:53.206]  It's because we want justice.
[02:18:53.227 --> 02:18:54.229]  We want freedom.
[02:18:54.249 --> 02:18:57.015]  We don't care what color you are, what gender you are, where you're from.
[02:18:57.035 --> 02:18:58.117]  I want you to have a future.
[02:19:02.342 --> 02:19:06.004]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[02:19:06.304 --> 02:19:09.726]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[02:19:10.086 --> 02:19:20.531]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series, as well as the first ever double-blind FDA-cleared human ingestion toxicity study.
[02:19:20.812 --> 02:19:23.553]  This formula is 24 ppm.
[02:19:23.913 --> 02:19:28.856]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA-cleared as a prescription medical device.
[02:19:28.916 --> 02:19:30.557]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[02:19:31.537 --> 02:19:36.100]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:36.841]  Ah, you don't want that.
[02:19:37.221 --> 02:19:37.801]  And VRE.
[02:19:38.442 --> 02:19:41.024]  Two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[02:19:41.244 --> 02:19:43.906]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[02:19:44.166 --> 02:19:47.488]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[02:19:47.848 --> 02:19:53.152]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[02:19:53.232 --> 02:19:57.315]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[02:19:58.207 --> 02:20:01.151]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[02:20:06.637 --> 02:20:09.260]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.031 --> 02:20:28.175]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:20:28.916 --> 02:20:30.178]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:32.941 --> 02:20:34.943]  This is the attack on our Republic.
[02:20:35.003 --> 02:20:38.226]  People wonder why all these other third world countries are hell holes, even though they have resources.
[02:20:38.707 --> 02:20:40.729]  Because people lay down, they just give in to the corruption.
[02:20:41.289 --> 02:20:45.374]  We have big mega banks, the Chi-Coms, Hollywood, trying to destroy this country right now.
[02:20:46.673 --> 02:20:49.896]  And they are openly shadow banning conservatives for four or five years.
[02:20:50.256 --> 02:20:57.182]  Now, 97% Paul Watson banned on YouTube, on Twitter, so he only gets a half million views and, you know, 10,000 retweets.
[02:20:58.603 --> 02:20:59.925]  It's the same with Mike Adams, myself.
[02:20:59.985 --> 02:21:01.106]  It's not about us, folks.
[02:21:01.226 --> 02:21:02.507]  I don't even want to do this anymore.
[02:21:03.127 --> 02:21:03.428]  Okay?
[02:21:03.468 --> 02:21:05.669]  Mike's already published, you know, 20, 30 best-selling books.
[02:21:05.689 --> 02:21:06.690]  He's got big websites.
[02:21:07.051 --> 02:21:07.771]  He's successful.
[02:21:08.072 --> 02:21:09.193]  We're in a war.
[02:21:10.216 --> 02:21:11.677]  They're trying to suppress everybody.
[02:21:12.117 --> 02:21:20.323]  And because of television, most people, even if they're awake, they're kind of in a, oh yeah, this mode of, they're gearing up for civil unrest.
[02:21:20.343 --> 02:21:22.045]  They're gearing up to shut everything down.
[02:21:22.865 --> 02:21:24.286]  They're admitting it's their plan.
[02:21:24.867 --> 02:21:26.368]  They're a bunch of failure scum.
[02:21:26.448 --> 02:21:28.589]  They shouldn't be able to dominate us.
[02:21:28.970 --> 02:21:30.031]  So Mike Adams, your report.
[02:21:30.953 --> 02:21:33.075]  The censorship master plan decoded.
[02:21:33.735 --> 02:21:36.577]  It's linked in a Paul Joseph Watson article or retweeted Alex Jones.
[02:21:36.617 --> 02:21:37.798]  People will find it easily.
[02:21:38.238 --> 02:21:40.500]  Emergency big text plot to kill free speech revealed.
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:47.124]  There's a petition in here that's only like a hundred thousand signatures to reinstate gun, the pedophile apologist, 400,000.
[02:21:47.164 --> 02:21:48.886]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:21:49.066 --> 02:21:49.986]  The president's listening.
[02:21:50.267 --> 02:21:51.888]  Great job Mike Adams getting a report out.
[02:21:52.208 --> 02:21:53.509]  If people want a blueprint,
[02:21:53.829 --> 02:21:57.711]  I can't believe that other people didn't put a blueprint out.
[02:21:58.131 --> 02:22:03.134]  I can't believe that I literally got asked by high-level people in the government to do this.
[02:22:03.394 --> 02:22:05.596]  Do you think it makes me feel good that, oh, I'm special?
[02:22:05.796 --> 02:22:06.756]  They're asking us to do it.
[02:22:06.816 --> 02:22:11.599]  No, it scares the living hell out of me that no one else seems to give a crap!
[02:22:12.418 --> 02:22:18.281]  And that's why they want to shut down, because we know what pieces of filth they are, and we have the answers to defeat them!
[02:22:19.161 --> 02:22:25.085]  The realization from this, Alex, that you are alluding to is that no one is coming to save us.
[02:22:25.125 --> 02:22:30.587]  There's not some great deity out there that's going to save us from this political situation.
[02:22:31.028 --> 02:22:32.909]  We have to stand up and save ourselves.
[02:22:33.369 --> 02:22:36.991]  And that's why, you know, just like you said, Alex, we didn't sign up for this.
[02:22:37.131 --> 02:22:39.632]  I don't want to be in this fight every day.
[02:22:39.692 --> 02:22:41.293]  This is not the life that I want to live.
[02:22:41.773 --> 02:22:45.617]  I was into just clean food and running a science lab and helping people stay healthy.
[02:22:45.937 --> 02:22:53.084]  That's really what I wanted to do, but now they've turned us into warriors for the freedom of speech, and we are on the front lines for whatever reason.
[02:22:53.144 --> 02:22:57.388]  We find ourselves here, and where, you know, it's because nobody else will do it.
[02:22:57.448 --> 02:22:58.089]  That's the thing!
[02:22:58.922 --> 02:22:59.262]  Yes!
[02:23:00.403 --> 02:23:04.225]  And you and I are like, if no one will do it, we will pick up the sword.
[02:23:04.386 --> 02:23:07.928]  We're not feeling sorry for ourselves when we do something and it has instant effect.
[02:23:08.248 --> 02:23:10.990]  And it's like if we got 10% more active, we'd win in a day!
[02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:14.152]  We have total victory in our hands if people will just do it!
[02:23:14.432 --> 02:23:17.733]  And we are fighting for the sustainability of civilization.
[02:23:17.773 --> 02:23:21.074]  I mean, make no mistake, we cannot sustain ourselves as a nation.
[02:23:21.094 --> 02:23:24.275]  The globalists admit they're trying to destabilize civilization and collapse it.
[02:23:24.335 --> 02:23:24.695]  That's it.
[02:23:25.075 --> 02:23:30.677]  Freedom of speech is a pillar of sustainable civilization, not even to mention a constitutional republic.
[02:23:30.977 --> 02:23:35.999]  Without freedom of speech, without the open marketplace of ideas, you can't have a nation that sustains itself.
[02:23:36.299 --> 02:23:37.479]  You end up in collapse.
[02:23:37.519 --> 02:23:38.279]  But that's what they want.
[02:23:38.619 --> 02:23:39.560]  A Marizuela.
[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:40.320]  They want that.
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:44.525]  Because they've organized it globally to extract all the power during the collapse.
[02:23:44.585 --> 02:23:45.586]  It's an admitted plan.
[02:23:45.626 --> 02:23:46.808]  It's so diabolical.
[02:23:47.108 --> 02:23:52.294]  And why doesn't the average person get they've been targeted at an exponential spiritual level on a resistance, Mike?
[02:23:52.334 --> 02:23:54.077]  See, I don't get that either because...
[02:23:55.236 --> 02:23:58.578]  We are so awake and so aware and it hits us so hard.
[02:23:58.939 --> 02:23:59.679]  What is at stake?
[02:23:59.999 --> 02:24:07.585]  It's like just the ability to see where this can go, to project two years down the road and see the hellhole of tyranny and authoritarianism.
[02:24:07.965 --> 02:24:10.827]  That vision just comes to mind and we fight against it.
[02:24:11.127 --> 02:24:12.008]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:24:12.628 --> 02:24:14.569]  Clearly, I want you to elaborate on this.
[02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:18.253]  They're getting ready for something big, trying to shut everybody down right now.
[02:24:18.813 --> 02:24:19.894]  What do you think that is?
[02:24:19.934 --> 02:24:20.435]  And what should we do?
[02:24:20.455 --> 02:24:21.636]  Because I can feel their energy.
[02:24:22.376 --> 02:24:23.477]  I can see their action.
[02:24:23.537 --> 02:24:24.899]  I mean, I know they're coming.
[02:24:24.919 --> 02:24:26.780]  It's like we're being overrun by the enemy.
[02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:31.204]  We have the force to absolutely repel them and defeat them, but not if we're not aware.
[02:24:31.385 --> 02:24:33.406]  Well, I'll share with you my worst case scenario.
[02:24:34.167 --> 02:24:34.727]  Scenario.
[02:24:35.207 --> 02:24:39.809]  I think they could do a nuclear false flag, dirty bomb, or nuclear attack.
[02:24:39.949 --> 02:24:41.769]  Oh, don't put them past him to kill Trump.
[02:24:41.789 --> 02:24:42.429]  It takes out Trump.
[02:24:42.729 --> 02:24:43.129]  Exactly.
[02:24:43.430 --> 02:24:44.290]  It takes out Trump.
[02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:49.391]  They blame it on patriots, or they blame it on Trump's negotiations with North Korea.
[02:24:49.431 --> 02:24:51.912]  They could say it's North Korea fighting back against Trump.
[02:24:51.932 --> 02:24:52.232]  Or Iran.
[02:24:52.532 --> 02:24:53.533]  Or Iran, exactly.
[02:24:53.853 --> 02:25:04.578]  But they take out Trump, and they take out 200,000 Americans at the same time, and then they blame conservatives, and then they use that to blacklist all conservatives, all speech online, and any dissenting views.
[02:25:05.319 --> 02:25:06.079]  This is the plan.
[02:25:06.139 --> 02:25:09.761]  They have to silence you, Alex, and they have to silence me before... Exactly.
[02:25:09.841 --> 02:25:16.485]  They wouldn't be taking the risk to shut us down when it wakes everybody up, the Streisand effect, if they weren't at a gut level, I know,
[02:25:17.485 --> 02:25:19.766]  I think well before the election, they're going to hit us.
[02:25:19.826 --> 02:25:20.246]  And I agree.
[02:25:20.766 --> 02:25:23.586]  I think it's going to be a biological or a nuclear event.
[02:25:23.706 --> 02:25:25.687]  But I think they want nuclear to kill POTUS.
[02:25:26.587 --> 02:25:27.187]  See, that's the thing.
[02:25:27.547 --> 02:25:31.488]  All they have to do is, and I'm not giving anybody ideas that they don't already know about.
[02:25:31.508 --> 02:25:33.028]  They're trying to kill Trump every day.
[02:25:33.068 --> 02:25:34.788]  They're death threats against Trump every day.
[02:25:35.268 --> 02:25:38.069]  The thing is, these tech giants are complicit in this, Alex.
[02:25:38.449 --> 02:25:41.230]  They are complicit in silencing these voices, even while they're denying it.
[02:25:41.250 --> 02:25:42.450]  Well, they're completely coordinated.
[02:25:42.690 --> 02:25:42.870]  Yes.
[02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:44.010]  Clearly.
[02:25:44.651 --> 02:25:50.696]  And ultimately, I can tell you, if Hillary Clinton had won the presidency, they would have already seized your domain names.
[02:25:51.076 --> 02:25:52.477]  They would not even be InfoWars.
[02:25:52.497 --> 02:25:53.498]  Well, they said they were.
[02:25:54.259 --> 02:25:55.240]  It was part of the plan.
[02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:56.441]  We were on the list.
[02:25:57.221 --> 02:26:01.184]  It came out in the Wikileaks that Soros would run the internet, and he pretty much does now.
[02:26:01.204 --> 02:26:06.128]  20,000 of his fact-checkers are the ones that, like, say I beat up a kid in Missouri.
[02:26:07.089 --> 02:26:10.091]  Yeah, and the thing is, that's such a bold lie, Mike.
[02:26:10.391 --> 02:26:10.652]  It is.
[02:26:10.672 --> 02:26:13.434]  They're acting like there's going to be no next month.
[02:26:13.614 --> 02:26:16.316]  I mean, you don't do stuff like that unless you don't think the future matters.
[02:26:16.576 --> 02:26:17.256]  Right, right.
[02:26:17.336 --> 02:26:18.737]  But you're exactly right.
[02:26:18.978 --> 02:26:25.942]  There's a point of desperation that they've reached because, to them, everything is contingent on what happens before the election.
[02:26:26.223 --> 02:26:36.070]  And they're willing to literally kill or have killed, I believe, hundreds of thousands of Americans to accomplish their goals of creating an authoritarian overlord society.
[02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:43.433]  Where no voice that is dissenting against the fanaticism of the left is allowed to even speak or to even exist.
[02:26:43.493 --> 02:26:46.654]  Tucker Carlson gets this, but where are all the others?
[02:26:46.674 --> 02:26:49.195]  I was about to say, Tucker is going under massive attack.
[02:26:49.215 --> 02:26:51.116]  I don't even know Ed Fox for doing this.
[02:26:51.296 --> 02:26:53.757]  You think he wants to champion all the demonization of Alex Jones?
[02:26:53.797 --> 02:26:53.937]  No.
[02:26:54.237 --> 02:26:55.177]  He gets, he's next.
[02:26:55.458 --> 02:26:58.159]  Hell, they're calling before this even happened for him to be removed!
[02:26:59.019 --> 02:27:03.204]  The reason I am here fighting for your voice, Alex, is because I see the big picture.
[02:27:03.605 --> 02:27:04.506]  I know what's at stake.
[02:27:04.926 --> 02:27:09.051]  I know that none of us will be allowed to exist in a free society.
[02:27:09.331 --> 02:27:12.295]  If they take away your First Amendment, they're going to take away your Second Amendment.
[02:27:12.315 --> 02:27:13.737]  And by the way, they have admitted that.
[02:27:13.817 --> 02:27:14.317]  They say...
[02:27:15.018 --> 02:27:26.184]  They're going to take, it's all in the news, they want Crowder off, they've already taken you off, they want Molyneux off, they want Tucker off, they want Sean Hannity off, anybody that's loyal to America.
[02:27:26.604 --> 02:27:29.986]  Real.Video has taken off 250 new channels a day.
[02:27:30.306 --> 02:27:34.748]  Real.Video, the YouTube alternative, literally 250 new channels a day.
[02:27:34.768 --> 02:27:35.789]  Can we live stream on that yet?
[02:27:36.761 --> 02:27:37.702]  Not yet, but that's coming.
[02:27:37.722 --> 02:27:39.103]  I want to set it up.
[02:27:39.143 --> 02:27:40.064]  We'll just leave you to it.
[02:27:40.104 --> 02:27:40.804]  Talk to your crew.
[02:27:41.004 --> 02:27:42.726]  All your videos are going live on there.
[02:27:42.746 --> 02:27:46.268]  I mean, the recorded videos are going on there right now, every day.
[02:27:46.689 --> 02:27:48.610]  All of InfoWars videos will be on Reel.Video.
[02:27:48.810 --> 02:27:51.592]  So if they ban you on YouTube, we've got an alternative.
[02:27:51.632 --> 02:27:52.093]  That's the key.
[02:27:52.273 --> 02:27:53.974]  And I'm losing money every day on that, Alex.
[02:27:54.014 --> 02:27:56.676]  I hope to make it revenue neutral at some point, but right now I'm losing money.
[02:27:56.796 --> 02:27:57.297]  I don't care.
[02:27:57.757 --> 02:27:58.918]  We have to have a platform.
[02:27:59.378 --> 02:28:00.138]  Well, I agree.
[02:28:00.218 --> 02:28:02.920]  Soros used to put in a billion a year to bring down the U.S.
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:05.981]  He put in, what was it, 28 billion this year.
[02:28:06.061 --> 02:28:08.142]  He put, they're all in.
[02:28:09.062 --> 02:28:10.743]  They are now, they're like, oh, you think you beat us?
[02:28:10.963 --> 02:28:11.543]  Full attack!
[02:28:11.683 --> 02:28:11.843]  Yeah.
[02:28:11.923 --> 02:28:22.648]  And I'm telling people, just if I have a little bit of a jerk around the office, I love everybody, my spiritual gut level as a man, I'm trying to control myself because all my instincts and everything is on full combat mode.
[02:28:22.948 --> 02:28:27.230]  This is so far beyond you or I having an ego in this.
[02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:29.851]  I'm saying my gut tells me this is it.
[02:28:29.991 --> 02:28:30.612]  Exactly.
[02:28:30.912 --> 02:28:38.175]  We are fighting on the front lines for human civilization to have a sustainable model of good ideas.
[02:28:38.235 --> 02:28:42.077]  You can feel an army coming over the hill before they even show up.
[02:28:42.277 --> 02:28:43.017]  And we can see them.
[02:28:43.037 --> 02:28:43.557]  We already know.
[02:28:43.597 --> 02:28:44.198]  You can feel it.
[02:28:44.958 --> 02:28:47.640]  They will collapse everything we value if we let them win.
[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:48.340]  Everything.
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:51.902]  They will destroy our civilization if we let them win.
[02:28:52.262 --> 02:28:53.023]  That's what's at stake.
[02:28:53.583 --> 02:28:54.804]  America is the prize.
[02:28:54.904 --> 02:28:56.025]  We fall, it all falls.
[02:28:56.665 --> 02:28:58.526]  God, oh my, that's why I called Roger Stone on election night.
[02:28:58.546 --> 02:29:00.007]  I said, this is just the beginning of the real war.
[02:29:02.853 --> 02:29:05.976]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:29:06.676 --> 02:29:07.417]  He's a punk.
[02:29:08.398 --> 02:29:09.138]  He's a dog.
[02:29:09.158 --> 02:29:10.640]  He's a pig.
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:12.481]  He can suck my f***ing d***.
[02:29:12.521 --> 02:29:15.003]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[02:29:15.123 --> 02:29:19.607]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you b***h, punk, d*** sucker.
[02:29:19.647 --> 02:29:21.068]  The President of the United States
[02:29:22.310 --> 02:29:25.514]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[02:29:25.594 --> 02:29:31.202]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[02:29:31.223 --> 02:29:31.823]  This is CNN.
[02:29:42.927 --> 02:29:49.032]  Yes, I have done an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:30:02.279 --> 02:30:05.481]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:30:05.922 --> 02:30:07.243]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:30:07.723 --> 02:30:19.252]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:30:19.952 --> 02:30:28.819]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:30:29.259 --> 02:30:35.121]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:30:35.321 --> 02:30:39.983]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:40.483 --> 02:30:42.803]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:30:43.144 --> 02:30:44.464]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:44.884 --> 02:30:54.507]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:54.607 --> 02:30:56.708]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[02:30:57.268 --> 02:31:02.170]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:31:06.892 --> 02:31:12.014]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.

[02:32:05.373 --> 02:32:06.754]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:32:06.814 --> 02:32:08.255]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:32:08.315 --> 02:32:08.675]  Go ahead.
[02:32:08.775 --> 02:32:09.076]  Yes.
[02:32:09.496 --> 02:32:10.216]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:10.337 --> 02:32:16.521]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:32:16.741 --> 02:32:20.724]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:32:20.964 --> 02:32:22.405]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:32:22.785 --> 02:32:29.470]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:32:29.550 --> 02:32:32.412]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:32:33.293 --> 02:32:37.997]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:32:38.037 --> 02:32:45.863]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:32:45.883 --> 02:32:51.688]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:32:51.828 --> 02:32:57.152]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:32:57.252 --> 02:33:00.235]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:33:06.158 --> 02:33:08.899]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:09.259 --> 02:33:32.345]  We walk the streets at night.
[02:33:32.505 --> 02:33:34.786]  We go where we go.
[02:33:38.519 --> 02:33:43.144]  They think I'm every loser, with jaded eyes and features.
[02:33:43.545 --> 02:33:45.307]  You think they really care?
[02:33:53.340 --> 02:33:55.402]  Well, we apologize for that little radio piece.
[02:33:55.542 --> 02:33:59.546]  I sent over his bumper music last week and said cut that out, but nobody cut that out, so I apologize.
[02:34:00.007 --> 02:34:01.908]  Just remove that from the lineup.
[02:34:02.249 --> 02:34:02.849]  Can we just do that?
[02:34:03.450 --> 02:34:04.311]  I'm sure we can get that done.
[02:34:04.711 --> 02:34:05.252]  Crew's great.
[02:34:05.672 --> 02:34:08.875]  I'm just really spoiling here for a fight with what's going on with the Globalist.
[02:34:08.955 --> 02:34:11.178]  Elijah Schaefer and Joy Vila.
[02:34:11.818 --> 02:34:12.759]  It means no introduction.
[02:34:12.779 --> 02:34:14.621]  She's going to be coming on, you know, Trump's
[02:34:16.963 --> 02:34:24.406]  Hollywood star got attacked by pickaxe and now folks come out and attack people that come out to it And it's all very racially charged against white people.
[02:34:24.426 --> 02:34:38.651]  It's very very sad, but the globalists were created in this country So it's it's a really really becoming a problem Mike clearly the media all of its building towards this towards something big this late summer this fall Do you agree with that and and what do you think is gonna happen?
[02:34:38.671 --> 02:34:39.331]  And how do we counter it?
[02:34:39.431 --> 02:34:41.532]  Well, they're absolutely building towards something.
[02:34:41.592 --> 02:34:57.483]  We can't predict what it is, but we know the purpose of it is to, of course, steal the election, demonize all Trump supporters, and then bring in an authoritarian, overlord type of society where only one official position is allowed to be spoken online about any given topic.
[02:34:57.903 --> 02:34:58.584]  That's the key.
[02:34:58.964 --> 02:35:03.387]  And it's the radical left that's going to determine what is allowed to be said about any given topic.
[02:35:03.807 --> 02:35:05.788]  And their positions are a moving target.
[02:35:06.169 --> 02:35:07.690]  Because under community guidelines,
[02:35:08.490 --> 02:35:13.833]  Hey, there's a viral video on ABC, NBC, CBS of an 11-year-old hitting adults in the face.
[02:35:13.873 --> 02:35:14.734]  A guy pushes him down.
[02:35:14.974 --> 02:35:16.155]  We play it like everybody else does.
[02:35:16.175 --> 02:35:16.935]  They say, what do you think?
[02:35:17.235 --> 02:35:19.017]  That turns into child endangerment.
[02:35:19.057 --> 02:35:20.097]  They don't let you see the video.
[02:35:20.337 --> 02:35:21.678]  They just say, endangered child.
[02:35:21.938 --> 02:35:28.522]  It's all up to community guidelines, what their little bots, their little people, their little George Soros media matters folks say.
[02:35:28.783 --> 02:35:29.683]  Oh, and let's be honest.
[02:35:29.703 --> 02:35:32.465]  Their community guidelines are enforced by people who are delusional.
[02:35:32.765 --> 02:35:41.649]  Because they themselves, the employees there who enforce these, have been subject to the indoctrination and brainwashing attempts of a fake news media.
[02:35:41.709 --> 02:35:43.590]  So this is circular reasoning.
[02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:52.834]  They say, we can ban you because our people say you're violating their guidelines, but their guidelines are false guidelines where they hate America.
[02:35:53.294 --> 02:36:00.002]  So if you love America, or if you are against people being attacked because they're Trump supporters, suddenly you're in violation.
[02:36:00.483 --> 02:36:01.504]  That's what it has come to.
[02:36:02.385 --> 02:36:09.073]  We're not just at war with the tech giants, we're at war against irrationality.
[02:36:10.185 --> 02:36:12.967]  You see, let's go ahead and play this and we have it bleeped.
[02:36:13.007 --> 02:36:17.210]  This is the Hollywood star of Donald Trump has been pickaxed out yesterday.
[02:36:17.230 --> 02:36:23.134]  And you've got a group of Hispanic young people who believe that whites are Nazis and that Trump's a Nazi.
[02:36:23.454 --> 02:36:24.215]  So they've showed up.
[02:36:24.275 --> 02:36:25.356]  You've got some Trump supporters.
[02:36:26.036 --> 02:36:26.556]  He's a Marine!
[02:36:26.596 --> 02:36:27.117]  He's a Marine!
[02:36:56.056 --> 02:36:56.116]  Hey!
[02:36:56.136 --> 02:36:56.196]  Hey!
[02:36:56.236 --> 02:36:56.336]  Hey!
[02:36:56.356 --> 02:36:56.436]  Hey!
[02:37:33.112 --> 02:37:38.895]  See, at that point, that man has the right to defend his life using whatever legal means are available to him.
[02:37:38.935 --> 02:37:43.097]  Oh, it just goes on from here, where the rite of passage just beat up a white guy.
[02:37:43.778 --> 02:37:47.840]  And again, I'm not going to hate these Hispanic folks because they're in a racial attack on white people.
[02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:48.860]  I understand they're brainwashed.
[02:37:49.300 --> 02:37:55.363]  At the same point, it doesn't matter if a whole mob of people are coming down on you because you're wearing a Trump shirt or American flag at a certain point, you know.
[02:37:56.064 --> 02:38:00.746]  I'm just glad nobody pulled a gun because, you know, a good 10, 15 guys try to beat up each guy.
[02:38:00.786 --> 02:38:01.647]  They stand their ground.
[02:38:02.347 --> 02:38:05.069]  That's going to happen though.
[02:38:05.609 --> 02:38:06.229]  That's going to happen.
[02:38:06.269 --> 02:38:19.057]  And you know, legal doctrine in most areas of the country says that if you are being attacked by one person who is a member of a gang or a mob, you have the right to stand your ground and defend yourself using even lethal force in defense of your life against that entire group.
[02:38:19.457 --> 02:38:21.778]  That is legal doctrine in most areas of the country.
[02:38:22.279 --> 02:38:23.619]  So it's going to happen.
[02:38:23.719 --> 02:38:25.601]  The left is pushing it, pushing it to that.
[02:38:25.941 --> 02:38:28.182]  And the tech giants are part of it, you see.
[02:38:28.602 --> 02:38:31.144]  Because they won't allow you to have a debate online.
[02:38:31.684 --> 02:38:34.206]  They're pushing it into this kind of violence on the streets.
[02:38:34.526 --> 02:38:35.346]  They're complicit in it.
[02:38:35.386 --> 02:38:46.613]  And by the way, even local news admits that the two Marine Corps veterans were attacked by a racial mob, but they go, oh that's okay, it's cute, they're Trump people, F them.
[02:38:48.214 --> 02:38:54.778]  Well, if this went to a real shooting war, which I don't want to happen, what's the left going to do when they get in their car in the morning and something happens?
[02:38:54.798 --> 02:39:01.022]  I mean, they don't understand, like, once you start a war with people who know how to engage in war, they take our kindness for weakness.
[02:39:01.962 --> 02:39:09.386]  We're here begging for people to hold their fire, do not escalate the violence, and the left is trying to escalate it every single day.
[02:39:09.827 --> 02:39:11.128]  Who threw the first punch in that fight?
[02:39:11.168 --> 02:39:13.349]  It was that radical left-wing hater.
[02:39:13.649 --> 02:39:15.030]  That's who threw the first punch.
[02:39:15.550 --> 02:39:16.891]  And don't they understand?
[02:39:17.251 --> 02:39:23.713]  This is going to become a kinetic war if they keep pushing it in this direction, even though we don't want to see that happen.
[02:39:24.233 --> 02:39:28.315]  We don't want to have to defend our nation using the Second Amendment.
[02:39:28.855 --> 02:39:29.776]  But guess what?
[02:39:30.096 --> 02:39:31.576]  That's where they are pushing it to.
[02:39:31.676 --> 02:39:37.879]  And it is sad, and I pray for our country, and I pray for the safety of our patriots, I pray for the safety of our president.
[02:39:38.559 --> 02:39:40.260]  And I don't know what else we can do, Alex.
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:43.641]  We are working to exercise our freedom of speech.
[02:39:43.921 --> 02:39:45.162]  We are building platforms.
[02:39:45.502 --> 02:39:46.362]  We are expanding.
[02:39:46.463 --> 02:39:47.883]  We are trying to tell the truth.
[02:39:47.923 --> 02:39:50.444]  We are trying to defend ourselves against these assaults.
[02:39:50.804 --> 02:39:54.326]  We are trying to call for peace and civility in society.
[02:39:54.606 --> 02:39:57.828]  And we are being attacked in every direction from every vector.
[02:40:00.582 --> 02:40:14.933]  And the lies, it doesn't even make me mad that they said I beat some kid up in Missouri and that I endangered children and take videos down or that I made fun of Muslims when I just showed radical Islamists pouring into Europe or, you know, I showed them having two-year-olds put money in the g-strings of men shaking their butts and their faces.
[02:40:14.993 --> 02:40:15.754]  I think it's child abuse.
[02:40:17.575 --> 02:40:19.137]  It's that they did all that
[02:40:20.632 --> 02:40:24.376]  And then they don't even show the video, and then people buy into it.
[02:40:25.498 --> 02:40:27.580]  It's that they're willing to lie at that level.
[02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:31.845]  You're like, my God, Brian Stelter and all these people really are sick.
[02:40:33.066 --> 02:40:37.127]  Then Anderson Cooper has 4,000 viewers with his $18 million show.
[02:40:38.147 --> 02:40:42.148]  That's kind of the good news here is that no one is buying into this.
[02:40:42.428 --> 02:40:43.048]  Your guests are here.
[02:40:43.068 --> 02:40:44.188]  That's right.
[02:40:44.228 --> 02:40:45.008]  Our guests are here.
[02:40:45.089 --> 02:40:47.589]  So we're going to go ahead and go to Elijah Schaefer.
[02:40:48.029 --> 02:40:50.550]  And we also have, as well, Joy Vila.
[02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:51.850]  They were down there last night.
[02:40:51.890 --> 02:40:52.690]  We just showed that photo.
[02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:53.910]  We've got two minutes until break.
[02:40:54.871 --> 02:40:56.351]  Describe why you went down there.
[02:40:57.291 --> 02:40:58.772]  Uh, you know, what unfolded.
[02:40:58.792 --> 02:41:00.192]  I mean, you guys are doing a lot of work.
[02:41:00.753 --> 02:41:03.694]  Also, you try to, I mean, it's just, it's just really gotten crazy.
[02:41:03.714 --> 02:41:05.535]  A lot of courage to do this.
[02:41:05.715 --> 02:41:08.016]  So good to have you back, Joy and Elijah.
[02:41:08.276 --> 02:41:09.337]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:41:09.457 --> 02:41:10.877]  It's always good to be on your show.
[02:41:10.937 --> 02:41:11.598]  You're a patriot.
[02:41:11.638 --> 02:41:12.178]  We love you.
[02:41:12.498 --> 02:41:35.725]  So we came out, we're doing a social experiment, me, Joy Villa, and Slightly Offensive, that's Elijah's YouTube channel, and it's been bipartisan, it's been showing a lot of hypocrisy of the left as well as some people on the right, and we just basically, we were not instigating anything, we wore Trump hats, Trump shirt, and we walked through the streets, we engaged in beautiful conversation, we landed at the Star in Hollywood, which is where we had people taking selfies with us,
[02:41:36.085 --> 02:41:36.506]  I think?
[02:41:49.828 --> 02:41:58.936]  These were obviously anti-Trump agitators who started pointing out the fact that our opinion, mine and my security, whose whites opinion didn't matter because we're white boys.
[02:41:59.276 --> 02:42:03.540]  And then he had the audacity to actually call Joy the N-word.
[02:42:04.081 --> 02:42:08.865]  And then he decided to justify that it didn't matter because he could say whatever he wanted.
[02:42:09.425 --> 02:42:12.488]  And that's basically right at that point Joy got upset.
[02:42:12.928 --> 02:42:14.549]  Yeah, I actually got in his face.
[02:42:14.609 --> 02:42:17.130]  Not confronting, but I just said, this is disrespectful.
[02:42:17.150 --> 02:42:18.751]  You're disrespecting black Americans.
[02:42:18.851 --> 02:42:20.612]  Americans, you're disrespecting the president.
[02:42:20.872 --> 02:42:22.093]  We're all here having fun.
[02:42:22.353 --> 02:42:26.535]  There was every color at that star celebrating the president after he's been destroyed.
[02:42:26.795 --> 02:42:28.256]  And we wanted to spread some love.
[02:42:28.696 --> 02:42:30.237]  And I said, get out of here.
[02:42:30.257 --> 02:42:31.298]  You're not welcome here.
[02:42:31.358 --> 02:42:33.939]  He started pulling down his pants and showing his butt.
[02:42:34.139 --> 02:42:35.460]  There was underage girls.
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:36.580]  There were kids there.
[02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:37.741]  He was getting in our face.
[02:42:37.761 --> 02:42:38.942]  He kept calling us.
[02:42:39.102 --> 02:42:41.363]  This is incredible because I saw the video and I'm remembering this.
[02:42:41.943 --> 02:42:43.644]  We bleeped it, but I mean exactly.
[02:42:44.105 --> 02:42:46.466]  Pulling their pants down, yelling, screaming, calling people the N-word.
[02:42:46.747 --> 02:42:47.888]  They do this to ICE agents.
[02:42:47.928 --> 02:42:48.788]  They do it to cops.
[02:42:49.208 --> 02:42:53.231]  They attack food trucks that are just nearby because an ICE agent eats at them.
[02:42:53.292 --> 02:42:54.853]  It's just a crazed evil.
[02:42:55.193 --> 02:42:56.934]  We'll break it all down the other side of this break.
[02:42:56.974 --> 02:42:57.695]  Stay with us.
[02:43:05.300 --> 02:43:14.211]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:43:14.731 --> 02:43:25.764]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:43:26.124 --> 02:43:31.867]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.
[02:43:32.067 --> 02:43:43.353]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions, Patriot Blend coffees have a smooth, bold flavor with great depth to give you just what you need in the morning.
[02:43:43.553 --> 02:43:47.515]  You can even choose to start your morning healthier with the Immune Support Blend.

[02:43:54.238 --> 02:44:00.624]  Get a bag of Patriot Blend coffee to support the show while enhancing your morning routine at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:44:02.786 --> 02:44:03.406]  Alpha Power.
[02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:07.270]  Vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[02:44:07.390 --> 02:44:15.357]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[02:44:15.757 --> 02:44:17.379]  But here's what you want to know.
[02:44:18.336 --> 02:44:24.299]  You want to go to mfulmorestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:44:24.959 --> 02:44:28.520]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:44:29.381 --> 02:44:37.404]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:44:37.964 --> 02:44:45.648]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:44:46.448 --> 02:44:50.217]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[02:44:50.779 --> 02:44:51.581]  It's Alpha Power.
[02:44:51.641 --> 02:44:54.748]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:44:55.823 --> 02:45:10.668]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:45:11.088 --> 02:45:16.409]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:45:16.749 --> 02:45:18.290]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[02:45:18.610 --> 02:45:19.451]  Oh man, it's really great.
[02:45:19.471 --> 02:45:19.931]  It really works.
[02:45:19.951 --> 02:45:24.555]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alva Power because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[02:45:25.095 --> 02:45:29.399]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:45:29.419 --> 02:45:30.760]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:45:31.581 --> 02:45:37.806]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[02:45:38.206 --> 02:45:40.248]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:45:40.868 --> 02:45:42.429]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:45:42.449 --> 02:45:43.790]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:45:43.831 --> 02:45:45.272]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[02:45:48.174 --> 02:45:49.015]  But here's an example.
[02:45:49.835 --> 02:45:57.441]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:45:57.461 --> 02:45:59.142]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:45:59.643 --> 02:46:05.808]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:46:06.488 --> 02:46:11.570]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:20.193]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:46:20.613 --> 02:46:21.634]  Nobody else does that.
[02:46:21.714 --> 02:46:24.375]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:46:24.895 --> 02:46:41.087]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the InfoWar, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:46:41.467 --> 02:46:49.733]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[02:46:50.774 --> 02:46:52.775]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:46:53.155 --> 02:46:58.698]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, AAA, 253-3139.
[02:46:58.738 --> 02:46:59.279]  A total 360 win.
[02:46:59.319 --> 02:47:00.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.502 --> 02:47:33.292]  Joy Veal is here, award-winning, top 10 artist.
[02:47:33.433 --> 02:47:38.038]  Elijah Schaefer, just kind of like he says, a centrist, person that's pro-free speech.
[02:47:38.058 --> 02:47:41.522]  A bunch of their videos are up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:47:42.895 --> 02:47:48.360]  You can also go to their sites, we'll give you some of those so people can check those out on screen.
[02:47:48.921 --> 02:48:02.894]  But I tell you, Mike Adams is riding shotgun with us right now and you see this type of stuff going on and you see it unfolding and you see the left attacking everybody everywhere and they're so
[02:48:03.595 --> 02:48:09.325]  It's like a KKK member, say, in the 50s, you know, beating up a black person trying to go to vote or whatever.
[02:48:09.646 --> 02:48:14.314]  They really believe they're in the right and they believe the BS and calling her...
[02:48:15.811 --> 02:48:16.672]  The N-word.
[02:48:17.512 --> 02:48:18.273]  All these videos.
[02:48:18.353 --> 02:48:23.736]  Every day I see a new video where the left, if it sees any black cops, calls them that.
[02:48:24.517 --> 02:48:25.217]  They attack women.
[02:48:25.237 --> 02:48:26.018]  They attack children.
[02:48:26.038 --> 02:48:27.279]  I mean, what is going on with these people?
[02:48:27.299 --> 02:48:41.268]  Well, and my question to Joy here would be, where are the leftists standing up for your right to exist as a citizen in this country, as someone who has a human soul, who has freedom to speak, who has your own personal diversity and expression of who you are?
[02:48:41.588 --> 02:48:44.590]  And there's not a single prominent leftist that has stood up for you.
[02:48:44.750 --> 02:48:45.571]  Why is that, Joy?
[02:48:46.972 --> 02:48:47.532]  Ridiculous.
[02:48:47.572 --> 02:48:49.634]  I think it's really because of Maxine Waters.
[02:48:49.794 --> 02:48:53.276]  She is like the godmother of this violent leftist movement.
[02:48:53.316 --> 02:48:57.359]  She's called for violence and attacks against Trump supporters.
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:01.362]  So people, they will see me and I am a black and Latina woman.
[02:49:01.642 --> 02:49:02.563]  I'm in Hollywood.
[02:49:02.603 --> 02:49:04.444]  Like you said, I'm just being myself.
[02:49:04.765 --> 02:49:11.890]  And yet they won't come to my defense because it is somehow justified to violently attack, to have racial slurs, to call me every name in the book.
[02:49:12.250 --> 02:49:14.952]  And Elijah, simply because we're Trump supporters.
[02:49:15.052 --> 02:49:18.274]  It's like that takes every human decency off the table.
[02:49:18.314 --> 02:49:19.495]  And we're here for peace.
[02:49:19.835 --> 02:49:21.176]  We wanted to have conversation.
[02:49:21.216 --> 02:49:27.140]  We had amazing conversations with people across the aisle before this riot and this mob started.
[02:49:27.220 --> 02:49:30.382]  And this guy was so violent, he was hyped up on every drug in the book.
[02:49:30.702 --> 02:49:34.184]  Elijah, tell them what happened after we started singing the national anthem.
[02:49:34.204 --> 02:49:38.167]  Yeah, so the national anthem, after we finished it actually, most people started booing us.
[02:49:38.727 --> 02:49:42.790]  I gotta ask you, it's like their textbook following what you'd imagine is some racist.
[02:50:05.469 --> 02:50:06.150]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:06.330 --> 02:50:06.710]  Exactly.
[02:50:06.730 --> 02:50:08.432]  It's like they're denying your right to exist.
[02:50:08.472 --> 02:50:09.553]  Do we have to drink at different fountains?
[02:50:09.573 --> 02:50:10.855]  Do we have to drink at different fountains?
[02:50:10.895 --> 02:50:13.878]  We're going to isolate and segregate different cafes.
[02:50:13.918 --> 02:50:15.580]  We don't shop at the same department stores.
[02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:16.801]  It's like a new Jim Crow.
[02:50:16.841 --> 02:50:17.582]  Well, that's another thing, though.
[02:50:17.602 --> 02:50:21.086]  The left doesn't want us in their businesses and stuff, but they don't even know how to work or do anything.
[02:50:21.406 --> 02:50:23.048]  They would all starve to death if we weren't there.
[02:50:23.368 --> 02:50:23.809]  That's true.
[02:50:24.289 --> 02:50:25.630]  Exactly.
[02:50:25.731 --> 02:50:37.783]  I mean, the violence escalated, actually, because the guy did leave after I told him to stop disrespecting America and stop calling us the N-word, because there was another older African-American gentleman there who also told him the same thing.
[02:50:38.063 --> 02:50:40.506]  He was offended, and we both were like, stop it.
[02:50:40.546 --> 02:50:41.306]  This is not okay.
[02:50:41.326 --> 02:50:42.327]  There's minors here.
[02:50:42.608 --> 02:50:43.909]  Pull your pants up.
[02:50:43.969 --> 02:50:46.332]  I mean, he was showing his everything to everyone.
[02:50:46.732 --> 02:50:48.533]  But in front of children, which is the indecency.
[02:50:48.553 --> 02:50:53.878]  He was simulating sex, he was doing, he was crude, you know, he was getting in my face, he was like, I know you want it.
[02:50:53.978 --> 02:50:55.979]  Typical gross, like, gross person.
[02:50:56.019 --> 02:51:04.806]  He came back, so he left, and then he came back with four other guys, and continued to get in our faces, and then that's when he was like, oh, you're not gonna fight me?
[02:51:05.106 --> 02:51:05.687]  Girl, no.
[02:51:06.383 --> 02:51:12.712]  The hypocrisy of this, though, is that they are doing this in the name of what they call equality and tolerance.
[02:51:13.192 --> 02:51:16.697]  They call themselves tolerant, and they say that you, Joy, that you are equal.
[02:51:16.717 --> 02:51:19.881]  And then the media, the controlled corporate media, will then cover up what's really happening.
[02:51:20.302 --> 02:51:20.662]  Of course.
[02:51:21.363 --> 02:51:27.069]  Actually, all they're doing is, those radical leftists are exposing their inner pedophile or something.
[02:51:27.109 --> 02:51:29.232]  And I notice you guys have a bunch of videos like these.
[02:51:29.252 --> 02:51:32.335]  It seems like things are escalating with this whole summer of rage.
[02:51:32.355 --> 02:51:35.839]  I think they're trying to censor libertarians, conservatives, ahead of something big.
[02:51:35.859 --> 02:51:37.601]  What do you think, Elijah and Joy?
[02:51:38.581 --> 02:51:48.705]  Yeah, so what I think is this, so last weekend, last Thursday, I went to Maxine Waters' office to go report on a protest that was happening there.
[02:51:49.205 --> 02:51:54.647]  And I actually went, we can get into this too, because Joy is not my only friend of color.
[02:51:54.987 --> 02:52:00.869]  I have a friend named Black Mike, you can look him up on Instagram, he's blowing up, official Black Mike, he's like the male Candace Owens.
[02:52:01.229 --> 02:52:11.814]  And if you see here, we went to go report there, and because I'm the wrong skin color now, which is people say that this whole idea of racism towards white people isn't real, but because I have blonde hair.
[02:52:11.834 --> 02:52:13.134]  Look, I'm a youth pastor.
[02:52:13.294 --> 02:52:14.375]  He is a youth pastor!
[02:52:14.415 --> 02:52:15.275]  I'm a worship leader.
[02:52:15.295 --> 02:52:16.436]  I've been to Bible college.
[02:52:16.516 --> 02:52:17.616]  I do global missions.
[02:52:17.656 --> 02:52:19.377]  I've done it in the Philippines and Mexico.
[02:52:19.757 --> 02:52:21.258]  I mean, I go all over the place.
[02:52:21.298 --> 02:52:23.779]  I'm sharing the message of Jesus and of love and of peace.
[02:52:24.159 --> 02:52:27.422]  And they're calling me a white supremacist, calling me KKK.
[02:52:28.062 --> 02:52:28.543]  They're going out there.
[02:52:28.563 --> 02:52:36.610]  And then it's so funny because we're out there, they accosted us, they assaulted us to the point where a pastor tried to get us out because they came at us with bats.
[02:52:36.690 --> 02:52:37.210]  And you know what?
[02:52:37.270 --> 02:52:42.375]  That was not done because there's a bunch of angry black people in South Central or whatever, Torrance area.
[02:52:42.715 --> 02:52:46.758]  It's because Maxine Waters has called them too violent.
[02:52:46.818 --> 02:52:48.320]  She's okayed this.
[02:52:49.403 --> 02:52:52.124]  And that's exactly what happened when we were on Hollywood Boulevard.
[02:52:52.144 --> 02:52:53.224]  They actually brought a knife.
[02:52:53.604 --> 02:52:55.205]  They stole his camera.
[02:52:55.345 --> 02:52:57.085]  They stole a $3,000 camera.
[02:52:57.105 --> 02:52:58.906]  They stole it out of my cameraman's hands.
[02:52:58.926 --> 02:53:02.007]  They punched our guard, who's a veteran, who's a military veteran.
[02:53:02.047 --> 02:53:04.388]  He was trying to do crowd control and saying, back up.
[02:53:04.408 --> 02:53:05.288]  And they said they didn't care.
[02:53:05.308 --> 02:53:09.570]  We told them, we go, hey, this guy is a Marine, has some respect.
[02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:15.491]  And all the kids, by the way, these are Generation Z, all there, like probably 20, 25 kids, are starting saying, who cares?
[02:53:15.511 --> 02:53:17.212]  12 years old or nine years old.
[02:53:17.372 --> 02:53:26.279]  He deserved it and stuff, and that's the next generation of what they're trying to bring up, are anti-American, anti-moral, anti-respect for people.
[02:53:26.339 --> 02:53:28.040]  Yeah, and this is the fight that broke out.
[02:53:28.280 --> 02:53:35.226]  They literally, he threw the first punch at our dear man, his name is Tony, and he actually suffered, his face got split open.
[02:53:35.506 --> 02:53:37.187]  He's suffering from a concussion right now.
[02:53:37.547 --> 02:53:40.009]  Four guys, four thugs on one.
[02:53:40.069 --> 02:53:41.370]  Beat him up, beat him up.
[02:53:41.470 --> 02:53:43.312]  Yeah, he actually beat them up too.
[02:53:43.392 --> 02:53:44.473]  One conservative to beat off
[02:53:44.953 --> 02:53:45.614]  Four guys.
[02:53:45.714 --> 02:53:46.094]  Yeah.
[02:53:46.134 --> 02:53:48.576]  Like he actually beat them up.
[02:53:48.677 --> 02:53:51.559]  What are you doing to protect your safety there?
[02:53:51.599 --> 02:53:55.323]  I mean, what you're describing are incredible acts of violence and racism.
[02:53:55.383 --> 02:53:57.425]  I never thought it would happen right on Hollywood Boulevard.
[02:53:57.445 --> 02:54:01.368]  But also the courage you've got to have to just wear Trump gear on Hollywood Boulevard.
[02:54:01.508 --> 02:54:02.229]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:54:02.769 --> 02:54:04.190]  We're not inciting the violence.
[02:54:04.230 --> 02:54:05.050]  We were smiling.
[02:54:05.690 --> 02:54:06.890]  There was all those little girls there.
[02:54:06.930 --> 02:54:07.991]  I said, oh, you look so pretty.
[02:54:08.011 --> 02:54:09.051]  You girls look so cute.
[02:54:09.091 --> 02:54:10.051]  You want to take a picture?
[02:54:10.291 --> 02:54:11.652]  We had the Trump stand-up.
[02:54:11.972 --> 02:54:12.952]  Elijah and I are making jokes.
[02:54:12.972 --> 02:54:14.193]  It was a family event.
[02:54:14.213 --> 02:54:15.473]  We're live streaming.
[02:54:15.513 --> 02:54:21.195]  By the way, we have all of that footage on my Periscope at joy underscore villa and on his Periscope.
[02:54:21.235 --> 02:54:24.356]  Yeah, you go to youtube.com slash slightlyoffensive and watch the whole live unfold.
[02:54:24.416 --> 02:54:25.476]  We stream the whole thing.
[02:54:25.536 --> 02:54:26.917]  And we're in a lot of articles about that as well.
[02:54:26.937 --> 02:54:27.257]  Absolutely.
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:33.505]  Trump overall is doing a pretty good job, but he needs to make a bigger deal out of this persecution.
[02:54:33.525 --> 02:54:36.608]  It needs to be done.
[02:54:37.308 --> 02:54:41.813]  It's race-based persecution.
[02:54:41.973 --> 02:54:42.794]  It is all racial.
[02:54:42.834 --> 02:54:44.375]  It's like, F you, you're a black person.
[02:54:44.535 --> 02:54:45.516]  F you, you're a white person.
[02:54:46.637 --> 02:54:47.558]  It's all race-based.
[02:54:47.578 --> 02:54:48.219]  It's insane.
[02:54:48.399 --> 02:54:49.640]  It's totally insane.
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:52.303]  Look, these are illegal acts.
[02:54:52.563 --> 02:54:54.684]  That's my take, but let me ask you about this.
[02:54:54.704 --> 02:55:05.728]  We think it's an assault and burglary and we want to push it as a hate crime because the point is he was calling us out for being white and for being black and saying that we didn't matter and he was going to say whatever he wanted.
[02:55:20.134 --> 02:55:21.235]  So if you're black, you're wrong.
[02:55:21.275 --> 02:55:22.296]  And if you're white, you're wrong.
[02:55:22.436 --> 02:55:23.976]  And if you're Latino, you're wrong.
[02:55:23.996 --> 02:55:24.157]  What?
[02:55:24.657 --> 02:55:25.617]  Well, listen, here's the deal.
[02:55:25.657 --> 02:55:27.739]  He means he follows Stephen Colbert.
[02:55:28.219 --> 02:55:29.379]  So let me ask you this question.
[02:55:29.519 --> 02:55:31.240]  Obviously, this guy needs to be discovered.
[02:55:31.681 --> 02:55:32.881]  We need to find out his identity.
[02:55:32.901 --> 02:55:34.082]  We should have a hotline for that.
[02:55:34.482 --> 02:55:36.944]  And if the LAPD won't prosecute him, it's a serious issue.
[02:55:36.964 --> 02:55:39.305]  There's a lot of other folks punching people in the head as well.
[02:55:40.256 --> 02:55:41.177]  Yes, there is.
[02:55:41.237 --> 02:55:47.526]  There's too much violence going on simply for wearing this red hat, simply for being pro-Trump, simply for wearing an American flag nowadays.
[02:55:47.806 --> 02:55:49.809]  You can get hurt and almost killed.
[02:55:49.869 --> 02:55:54.695]  I mean, I'm used to having death threats, but walking down the street wearing a Trump hat, that should not be the norm.
[02:55:55.276 --> 02:56:00.761]  Pull up Joy Vila in that great Academy Awards deal in 2016 in the great red, white, and blue dress.
[02:56:00.801 --> 02:56:02.303]  I mean, that really made him mad.
[02:56:02.343 --> 02:56:03.524]  But I mean, this is America.
[02:56:03.584 --> 02:56:10.871]  People should be able to... Plus, just since Trump's been so successful with the economy and unemployment and so many things, you'd think it would lessen their anger.
[02:56:10.911 --> 02:56:12.112]  But no, it's worse now.
[02:56:12.393 --> 02:56:14.475]  Because if he gets proven right, it's over for them.
[02:56:15.396 --> 02:56:16.476]  Especially for minorities.
[02:56:16.516 --> 02:56:17.557]  He's lessened the burden.
[02:56:17.777 --> 02:56:18.837]  We now have jobs.
[02:56:18.877 --> 02:56:23.258]  You know, my cousins who are black, my cousins who are Latino, they have jobs now because of Trump.
[02:56:23.298 --> 02:56:24.999]  The economy is flourishing and prospering.
[02:56:25.239 --> 02:56:27.560]  People are walking away from the Democratic plantation.
[02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:29.740]  And people are seeing that Trump is a peacemaker.
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:36.362]  He's going to make peace with major, you know, superpowers around the world so that America can be great again.
[02:56:36.623 --> 02:56:37.323]  This is huge.
[02:56:38.263 --> 02:56:41.747]  And just to say to both of you, you are so welcome here at InfoWars.
[02:56:41.787 --> 02:56:43.328]  You are welcome on our platforms.
[02:56:43.669 --> 02:56:46.912]  Create a channel on Real.Video, by the way, so we can cover your videos editorially.
[02:56:47.292 --> 02:56:49.074]  You are welcome here, and you are loved here.
[02:56:49.094 --> 02:56:50.756]  You are loved for your work as a pastor.
[02:56:51.056 --> 02:56:52.478]  You are loved for your work for peace.
[02:56:52.758 --> 02:56:55.020]  You are loved for your voice, for your spirit, who you are.
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:57.703]  We see you, we recognize you, and we embrace you.
[02:56:58.224 --> 02:57:01.006]  And the establishment wants to lie about both of them.
[02:57:01.607 --> 02:57:04.448]  They want to lie about both these great people and then misrepresent it.
[02:57:04.488 --> 02:57:06.309]  That's why they want to silence us.
[02:57:06.329 --> 02:57:06.729]  That's the key.
[02:57:06.749 --> 02:57:07.569]  It's not just silences.
[02:57:07.849 --> 02:57:10.430]  They want to silence us and then misrepresent what we've done.
[02:57:10.570 --> 02:57:10.790]  Yes.
[02:57:11.450 --> 02:57:12.371]  Right.
[02:57:12.611 --> 02:57:12.991]  Right.
[02:57:13.031 --> 02:57:13.231]  Right.
[02:57:13.331 --> 02:57:13.771]  That's right.
[02:57:13.791 --> 02:57:14.551]  It's to shut you out.
[02:57:14.571 --> 02:57:15.332]  And I want to say this.
[02:57:15.732 --> 02:57:20.914]  At this point now in Los Angeles, it doesn't matter whether you're black, brown or white.
[02:57:21.254 --> 02:57:23.354]  It doesn't matter if you're left or right.
[02:57:23.414 --> 02:57:24.835]  We're fighting for a safe L.A.
[02:57:25.095 --> 02:57:25.915]  Safe L.A.
[02:57:25.935 --> 02:57:31.057]  We have some major social projects coming up between Joy Villa and Slightly Offensive.
[02:57:31.637 --> 02:57:36.518]  And we're also going to be teaming up with some FLECAS Talks in the future and official Black Mike.
[02:57:36.838 --> 02:57:39.499]  We're starting an entire... Hold on, we're back in 70 seconds.
[02:57:39.519 --> 02:57:42.799]  We have five more minutes to talk about what you're doing and what you see coming next.
[02:57:42.819 --> 02:57:44.920]  But clearly, we've passed the point of return.
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:47.340]  Critical juncture this summer and fall.
[02:57:47.680 --> 02:57:49.761]  The globalists are making their move, but so are we.
[02:57:49.781 --> 02:57:51.001]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:57:52.001 --> 02:57:55.062]  Trump is representing America, like he's for the United States.
[02:57:56.650 --> 02:57:57.951]  I'm so sorry, sir.
[02:57:57.971 --> 02:57:59.073]  I tried to stop him.
[02:57:59.093 --> 02:57:59.673]  Not your fault.
[02:57:59.753 --> 02:58:02.256]  You can't stop a man who's drunk.
[02:58:02.276 --> 02:58:03.617]  36 Greyhounds, end to end.
[02:58:03.838 --> 02:58:04.498]  It's alright, missus.
[02:58:04.518 --> 02:58:05.559]  I'll do my best.
[02:58:09.303 --> 02:58:09.483]  Yes.
[02:58:09.544 --> 02:58:09.864]  Mr. Bank.
[02:58:11.325 --> 02:58:14.208]  Do you know what Chuck Berry said every night before counting 1, 2, 3, 4?
[02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:18.213]  What did he say?
[02:58:18.573 --> 02:58:19.294]  Pay me my money!
[02:58:20.856 --> 02:58:23.277]  Well, I'm sure my people will be in cash.
[02:58:41.563 --> 02:58:43.724]  And yet we're paying a lot of money to protect.
[02:58:43.764 --> 02:58:45.725]  Now, this has been going on for decades.
[02:58:46.385 --> 02:58:53.989]  This has been brought up by other presidents, but other presidents never did anything about it because I don't think they understood it or they just didn't want to get involved.
[02:58:54.949 --> 02:58:57.930]  But I have to bring it up because I think it's very unfair to our country.
[02:58:57.950 --> 02:58:59.491]  It's very unfair to our taxpayer.
[02:59:00.512 --> 02:59:03.653]  And I think that these countries have to step it up, not over a 10-year period.
[02:59:03.693 --> 02:59:05.194]  They have to step it up immediately.
[02:59:05.534 --> 02:59:06.834]  Germany is a rich country.
[02:59:07.355 --> 02:59:09.636]  They talk about they can increase it a tiny bit.
[02:59:10.576 --> 02:59:10.757]  By 2030.
[02:59:12.599 --> 02:59:17.105]  Well, they could increase it immediately tomorrow and have no problem.
[02:59:17.125 --> 02:59:19.067]  I don't think it's fair to the United States.
[02:59:19.127 --> 02:59:22.832]  So we're going to have to do something because we're not going to put up with it.
[02:59:22.912 --> 02:59:23.833]  We can't put up with it.
[02:59:23.994 --> 02:59:25.696]  And it's inappropriate.
[02:59:29.571 --> 02:59:32.572]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the n-word?
[02:59:33.592 --> 02:59:38.193]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[02:59:38.793 --> 02:59:41.574]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[02:59:42.134 --> 02:59:45.955]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[02:59:46.576 --> 02:59:47.616]  I wouldn't support that group.
[02:59:47.916 --> 02:59:48.216]  Would you?
[02:59:48.236 --> 02:59:51.177]  This has been a public service announcement from InfoWars.com
[02:59:54.321 --> 02:59:58.422]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:58.942 --> 03:00:00.283]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.826 --> 03:00:15.327]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:16.407 --> 03:00:18.208]  In the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:19.568 --> 03:00:21.709]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[03:00:25.919 --> 03:00:28.642]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:31.824 --> 03:00:35.768]  So, the big tech giants have gotten, you know, 80% of the internet under their control.
[03:00:35.808 --> 03:00:37.789]  Now they're trying to censor everything, bringing in globalism.
[03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.610]  It's failing.
[03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:40.131]  They're plunging, their stocks are plunging.
[03:00:40.532 --> 03:00:41.933]  They're in trouble, people are leaving them in droves.
[03:00:41.973 --> 03:00:50.641]  But they're desperately then trying to have case points, case studies to shut me down, to shut others down, and then set the precedent.
[03:00:51.550 --> 03:00:56.315]  So they can then send out their mobs on the street to beat up people and take action against First Amendment there.
[03:00:57.336 --> 03:01:00.600]  So Elijah Schaeffer, Joy Vila are here, Mike Adams.
[03:01:00.620 --> 03:01:04.404]  I want to get a final statement on all of you and I want to invite you guys back up very, very soon.
[03:01:04.424 --> 03:01:07.848]  The important work you're doing and just get predictions of what you think is coming next.
[03:01:09.318 --> 03:01:11.620]  Yeah, well, we're working on some projects together.
[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:19.326]  I have some new music coming out, a song all about freedom, and I really want to push this free speech and peace-loving movement forward.
[03:01:19.666 --> 03:01:20.687]  Right, so check this out.
[03:01:20.947 --> 03:01:31.115]  I know a lot of your viewers are familiar with Austin Fletcher, who runs the online media group Fleckistalks, and I know he's been a little bit under the radar, and people have been wondering, what's going on?
[03:01:31.195 --> 03:01:31.855]  Where has he been?
[03:01:31.975 --> 03:01:32.816]  Where has he been on the streets?
[03:01:32.836 --> 03:01:33.637]  Well, I have good news.
[03:01:34.177 --> 03:01:35.098]  Slightly offensive.
[03:01:35.478 --> 03:01:37.060]  We're good to go.
[03:01:54.015 --> 03:02:00.520]  And conversation happens, and he's coming back bigger, badder, and stronger, and we're joining teams.
[03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:01.981]  And actually, our first guest is going to be here.
[03:02:02.001 --> 03:02:05.043]  I'm going to be their first guest, and everything is on the table.
[03:02:05.303 --> 03:02:10.647]  As a conservative who is in this crazy atmosphere, any question, no questions off the table.
[03:02:10.907 --> 03:02:13.449]  Just really being edgy about it, on all my beliefs.
[03:02:13.469 --> 03:02:16.371]  That's very exciting, and we want to follow that and have you guys on.
[03:02:16.391 --> 03:02:17.531]  I want to get Fleckis on.
[03:02:17.551 --> 03:02:18.292]  He's been on before, too.
[03:02:18.312 --> 03:02:19.273]  He's the guy with the spoon, right?
[03:02:20.154 --> 03:02:21.255]  Yeah, that's right, that's right.
[03:02:21.275 --> 03:02:22.935]  He's a good friend of ours.
[03:02:22.975 --> 03:02:25.156]  What's happening though with the big push?
[03:02:25.196 --> 03:02:28.718]  I see the left, the globalists, want to try to sew things up by the end of the year.
[03:02:28.758 --> 03:02:29.919]  I think they're making their move.
[03:02:30.899 --> 03:02:32.020]  Oh yeah, they're making their move.
[03:02:32.100 --> 03:02:36.802]  I mean, we've got socialism, globalism coming out from every woodwork.
[03:02:37.022 --> 03:02:39.383]  Their only message now is going to be violence.
[03:02:39.723 --> 03:02:45.446]  And literally when I had conversations with a few leftists yesterday, they said, well, Donald Trump incites violence.
[03:02:45.486 --> 03:02:46.887]  I said, how does he incite violence?
[03:02:46.927 --> 03:02:47.587]  He just does.
[03:02:48.087 --> 03:02:51.489]  So they're going to blame us for their violent actions.
[03:02:51.769 --> 03:02:57.612]  I see a lot more from the left, but I also see a lot of black and Latinos running from the Democratic plantation.
[03:02:57.872 --> 03:03:03.035]  I see a lot of them being exposed to the truth and saying, no, I don't want to be a part of this party.
[03:03:03.315 --> 03:03:07.058]  So it's up to the Republicans and the Trumplicans to say, come on over here.
[03:03:07.118 --> 03:03:10.740]  We're the good guys, and we're going to show you where you can thrive and where you can disagree.
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:11.480]  That's right, a big tent.
[03:03:11.540 --> 03:03:14.862]  So there is a walkaway exodus happening, Mike.
[03:03:15.923 --> 03:03:18.906]  I want to point out the refreshing difference here.
[03:03:18.986 --> 03:03:30.900]  Look at these amazing people Elijah and Joy here and compare their spirit and their soul versus the dark scumbag orcs who are pushing this violence and hatred across America.
[03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:33.403]  I mean I'm looking at you two here on the Skype feed and
[03:03:33.823 --> 03:03:35.485]  You're just, both of you are beautiful.
[03:03:35.826 --> 03:03:40.492]  Both of you are what we need, the human spirit, for not just America, but for our world.
[03:03:40.532 --> 03:03:47.401]  We need more people like you, and we are tired of having to stomp on gremlins and goblins and orcs everywhere.
[03:03:47.762 --> 03:03:48.843]  We don't want to live in that world!
[03:03:48.883 --> 03:03:50.826]  No, I agree, and that's the thing is...
[03:03:51.747 --> 03:03:55.709]  Just like Anderson Cooper's new show, $18 million, had 4,000 viewers.
[03:03:56.349 --> 03:03:58.630]  Like you said, the human spirit is rejecting them.
[03:03:58.650 --> 03:04:00.991]  So guys, what's the best website for people to find both of you?
[03:04:01.031 --> 03:04:02.232]  Yournaturalnews.com.
[03:04:02.552 --> 03:04:04.633]  Mike Adams, the great work you're doing, naturalnews.com.
[03:04:04.973 --> 03:04:07.294]  I'm infowars.com, newswars.com.
[03:04:07.394 --> 03:04:09.195]  Joy, Elijah, what's the best sites for you guys?
[03:04:10.248 --> 03:04:14.512]  I'm joyvilla.com, you can follow me on Twitter at joy underscore villa.
[03:04:15.132 --> 03:04:21.297]  Please, I appreciate your comments and I love getting into communication with you guys, my joy tribe, joyvilla.com.
[03:04:21.337 --> 03:04:26.922]  Right, and you can find me at youtube.com slash slightlyoffensive or check me out Twitter, Instagram at Elijah Schaefer.
[03:04:27.242 --> 03:04:28.022]  Alright, very exciting.
[03:04:28.062 --> 03:04:28.943]  Let's talk again soon.
[03:04:28.963 --> 03:04:30.243]  You guys come back on routinely.
[03:04:30.944 --> 03:04:31.764]  Time goes by.
[03:04:31.784 --> 03:04:32.444]  We love you guys.
[03:04:32.484 --> 03:04:33.025]  Watch your work.
[03:04:33.045 --> 03:04:33.665]  Really appreciate you.
[03:04:33.685 --> 03:04:34.145]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:34.485 --> 03:04:36.566]  Mike, great job with your censorship master plan decoded.
[03:04:36.586 --> 03:04:38.087]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:04:38.107 --> 03:04:38.807]  Congress has got it.
[03:04:38.827 --> 03:04:39.668]  People are starting to wake up.
[03:04:39.968 --> 03:04:41.048]  The shadow bannings of the news.
[03:04:41.068 --> 03:04:43.669]  We've gone from no awareness to now some major awareness.
[03:04:43.689 --> 03:04:44.970]  So great job on the report, Mike.
[03:04:45.570 --> 03:04:46.852]  Great job to the crew and everybody else.
[03:04:47.553 --> 03:04:50.518]  We've got Joel Gilbert coming up with key intel straight ahead in the war room.
[03:04:50.878 --> 03:04:52.721]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:04:53.021 --> 03:04:54.463]  However you're listening, spread those links.
[03:04:54.484 --> 03:04:56.306]  The censors absolutely hate it.
[03:04:56.326 --> 03:04:57.688]  They're really afraid of this broadcast.
[03:04:57.949 --> 03:04:58.670]  They're afraid of you.
[03:04:58.750 --> 03:04:59.150]  Thank you all.
[03:05:03.678 --> 03:05:10.100]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[03:05:10.180 --> 03:05:16.982]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[03:05:17.002 --> 03:05:32.527]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[03:05:33.621 --> 03:05:37.323]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[03:06:14.096 --> 03:06:16.297]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:16.777 --> 03:06:21.898]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:35.971 --> 03:06:37.711]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:37.771 --> 03:06:44.393]  I'm Joel Gilbert, coming to you right from the left coast, live from the People's Republic of California here in Los Angeles.
[03:06:45.173 --> 03:06:46.774]  You know me as a frequent guest of Alex.
[03:06:46.854 --> 03:06:56.016]  I've talked about my films, Dreams from My Real Father, There's No Place Like Utopia, the new film The Trump, The Art of the Insult, in the InfoWars store.
[03:06:57.036 --> 03:06:58.556]  I'll be taking a lot of calls today.
[03:06:58.616 --> 03:07:01.017]  I've been hosting for several months, lots of great guests.
[03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:05.213]  And I get about 100 emails every time that I only took one phone call.
[03:07:05.713 --> 03:07:07.715]  So I will be taking a bunch of calls later.
[03:07:07.735 --> 03:07:14.119]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:07:14.139 --> 03:07:14.780]  877-789-2539.
[03:07:16.261 --> 03:07:18.963]  And we'll talk about anything you want to talk about.
[03:07:20.004 --> 03:07:21.365]  First, I'm going to give some of my takes.
[03:07:22.305 --> 03:07:23.947]  We've got coming up next Monday.
[03:07:23.987 --> 03:07:24.787]  Be sure to watch.
[03:07:25.528 --> 03:07:28.130]  Jay-Z has produced a documentary on
[03:07:29.016 --> 03:07:32.957]  The Trayvon Martin case called Rest in Power about Trayvon Martin.
[03:07:34.077 --> 03:07:38.658]  And what occurs to me is that the timing of this is quite suspect.
[03:07:39.438 --> 03:07:45.039]  The midterms elections are coming up, and Jay-Z was a big buddy of Obama, of course.
[03:07:45.099 --> 03:07:50.820]  Many parties, of course, Beyoncé, lip-sync, the national anthem at the second inauguration.
[03:07:51.780 --> 03:07:55.181]  So it occurs to me that this is just a typical formula of the Democrats.
[03:07:55.221 --> 03:07:56.441]  They try to agitate
[03:07:57.533 --> 03:08:07.135]  Uh, or activate, uh, black people by controlling their emotions with something, you know, very incendiary about the tragic death of Trayvon Martin.
[03:08:08.056 --> 03:08:12.497]  And, uh, let's take a quick reminder how the case started in the first place.
[03:08:13.577 --> 03:08:26.120]  Of course, uh, apparently Trayvon Martin was walking through this, uh, apartment complex, neighborhood watch guy, George Zimmerman, sees that he's kind of hanging around and not going anywhere, calls the cops, gets out,
[03:08:26.926 --> 03:08:33.689]  At some point, Trayvon sucker punches him in the nose, gets on top of him, starts bashing his head in the cement.
[03:08:35.610 --> 03:08:36.731]  Zimmerman calls for help.
[03:08:36.911 --> 03:08:38.112]  Nobody comes to help him.
[03:08:38.652 --> 03:08:40.573]  Eventually, he takes out a gun and shoots him.
[03:08:41.913 --> 03:08:43.194]  He's very apologetic.
[03:08:43.234 --> 03:08:44.134]  He's very sorry.
[03:08:44.235 --> 03:08:47.396]  He puts himself in the hands of the police.
[03:08:47.536 --> 03:08:48.156]  No lawyer.
[03:08:48.477 --> 03:08:49.577]  He does a recreation.
[03:08:49.617 --> 03:08:50.738]  He submits to interviews.
[03:08:51.598 --> 03:08:53.039]  Two weeks later, the cops
[03:08:53.783 --> 03:08:55.184]  Said that it was self-defense.
[03:08:55.204 --> 03:08:56.045]  There's no evidence.
[03:08:56.265 --> 03:08:58.647]  All the witnesses support Zimmerman's account.
[03:09:00.068 --> 03:09:01.630]  And the cops did their job.
[03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:06.974]  It was, you know, Zimmerman put himself in the justice system to be treated fairly.
[03:09:07.715 --> 03:09:09.997]  But then the Department of Justice figured out a way.
[03:09:10.137 --> 03:09:12.139]  We've got the midterms coming.
[03:09:12.159 --> 03:09:15.081]  We've got the actually presidential elections coming up in November.
[03:09:15.842 --> 03:09:18.284]  And wouldn't this be really good to agitate people?
[03:09:19.236 --> 03:09:21.998]  Let's send the DOJ down there to help.
[03:09:22.599 --> 03:09:29.964]  In fact, the DOJ came down and organized protests and tried to get a case against Zimmerman put together.
[03:09:30.825 --> 03:09:37.710]  And what they ignored was the reality of the situation is the local cops gave Zimmerman justice.
[03:09:37.750 --> 03:09:42.314]  They also ignored the fact that Trayvon Martin, when you looked at his life, when you learned about his life,
[03:09:43.402 --> 03:09:46.463]  He had a very typical experience of a lot of black people in this country.
[03:09:46.503 --> 03:09:55.886]  He was a student in high school, no jobs, and in the Obama economy, he probably couldn't find a job as a high school student.
[03:09:55.926 --> 03:10:00.987]  So a lot of kids like him are attracted to nonsense like buying and dealing drugs.
[03:10:01.668 --> 03:10:12.891]  We saw in his text messages his uncle was selling him a gun, involved in all kind of nonsense, such that he ended up there in that situation, a very tragic death.
[03:10:13.972 --> 03:10:24.917]  And the Democrats decided to essentially use that tragic death of Mr. Martin, as well as use this guy, this Democrat, George Zimmerman, who was an Obama supporter.
[03:10:25.357 --> 03:10:27.618]  He'd helped black people, the Sherman Ware case.
[03:10:28.118 --> 03:10:33.281]  He was someone who was an advocate for the underprivileged, a Hispanic guy.
[03:10:34.641 --> 03:10:37.983]  And the Democrats and Obama just exploited the tragedy.
[03:10:38.992 --> 03:10:40.392]  Uh, and this is just very typical.
[03:10:40.432 --> 03:10:48.414]  So when you I encourage everyone to check it out on Monday, and I think there's a second installment the next week of Jay-Z's documentary.
[03:10:48.434 --> 03:10:53.595]  I'll be watching Rest in Power and see what you think about it, and we can talk about it next time.
[03:10:55.275 --> 03:11:00.796]  Now, when I think of Democrats lately, I'm thinking of them as little children.
[03:11:00.956 --> 03:11:05.377]  I call this segment Children, Democrats, Children and Adults.
[03:11:06.212 --> 03:11:09.513]  I want to play a little bit of my trailer of There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:11:09.533 --> 03:11:12.834]  We're going to watch that and see what the mentality is.
[03:11:26.618 --> 03:11:27.918]  Oh, we're glad you landed at Oz.
[03:11:27.938 --> 03:11:28.799]  We've got a wizard here.
[03:11:28.819 --> 03:11:29.839]  He can solve your problems.
[03:11:30.199 --> 03:11:32.680]  Because he's special.
[03:11:38.496 --> 03:11:40.677]  People on welfare assistance here mostly.
[03:11:41.077 --> 03:11:42.157]  That's the whole city.
[03:11:42.397 --> 03:11:49.079]  We're going to replace capitalism with socialism.
[03:11:49.119 --> 03:11:52.319]  To remake the world as it should be.
[03:11:52.940 --> 03:11:55.900]  Okay, let's cut it off right there.
[03:11:56.060 --> 03:11:59.021]  You get the idea of from there's no place like Utopia.
[03:11:59.441 --> 03:12:02.882]  So I think of Democrats as little kids, little kind of like
[03:12:04.085 --> 03:12:06.828]  Crying babies that kind of want to have everything their way.
[03:12:06.868 --> 03:12:08.269]  They want to play all the time.
[03:12:08.469 --> 03:12:10.611]  And in this case, they'd like to play government.
[03:12:12.012 --> 03:12:14.755]  So I start to think of things like, well, what do little kids like to do?
[03:12:15.035 --> 03:12:15.756]  What do they like to do?
[03:12:16.557 --> 03:12:17.978]  Number one, they like to ride bikes.
[03:12:18.278 --> 03:12:23.563]  Let's take a look at John Kerry riding a bike and how that worked out from Trump, the art of the insult.
[03:12:26.085 --> 03:12:26.606]  John Kerry.
[03:12:30.695 --> 03:12:31.015]  Okay.
[03:12:31.415 --> 03:12:38.357]  John Kerry in this film, you'll see how much he likes to ride bikes and how Trump reacted in Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:12:38.417 --> 03:12:39.217]  He was in Geneva.
[03:12:40.498 --> 03:12:44.058]  What else do little kids like to do?
[03:12:44.098 --> 03:12:45.139]  They like to play doctor.
[03:12:45.559 --> 03:12:46.279]  Obamacare.
[03:12:47.039 --> 03:12:49.280]  You know, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
[03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:50.160]  Let's play doctor.
[03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:57.242]  We'll take $400 from everyone who doesn't want to play and we'll give it to people who don't want to pay.
[03:12:57.282 --> 03:12:58.082]  That's a fun game.
[03:12:59.039 --> 03:13:00.820]  Oh, sorry, there's no more insurance companies.
[03:13:00.880 --> 03:13:02.101]  Oh, I'm sorry, the price went up.
[03:13:02.121 --> 03:13:03.101]  There's no more hospitals.
[03:13:03.141 --> 03:13:04.462]  Let's, you know, let's play another game.
[03:13:05.483 --> 03:13:08.044]  Let's look at John Kerry playing on his bicycle.
[03:13:08.084 --> 03:13:09.325]  Let's play that from the beginning.
[03:13:09.345 --> 03:13:12.307]  Negotiations on Iran's nuclear policy went awry for U.S.
[03:13:12.347 --> 03:13:14.068]  Secretary of State John Kerry.
[03:13:14.388 --> 03:13:14.788]  Police!
[03:13:17.770 --> 03:13:20.151]  He falls, he breaks his leg during the negotiation.
[03:13:20.511 --> 03:13:24.414]  I swear to you, I will never be in a bicycle race as long as I'm president.
[03:13:26.792 --> 03:13:29.573]  Okay, so little children like to play doctor.
[03:13:30.193 --> 03:13:31.734]  They like to ride bikes.
[03:13:31.794 --> 03:13:32.154]  What else?
[03:13:32.214 --> 03:13:34.335]  Little children like cartoon characters.
[03:13:34.775 --> 03:13:37.176]  Cartoon characters are very interesting for little children.
[03:13:37.936 --> 03:13:41.177]  And I think that's why Democrats like people like Stalin and Mao.
[03:13:43.038 --> 03:13:43.618]  Chavez.
[03:13:44.459 --> 03:13:47.420]  Of course, Castro, the Castro brothers.
[03:13:47.880 --> 03:13:48.760]  Che Guevara.
[03:13:49.361 --> 03:13:51.601]  You know, Obama was obsessed with going to Cuba.
[03:13:51.621 --> 03:13:53.002]  He wanted to meet Castro.
[03:13:53.382 --> 03:13:55.443]  He wanted to have his picture with Che Guevara.
[03:13:56.167 --> 03:14:02.755]  Democrats and progressives love these funny, strange cartoon characters like Chavez, Mao, Stalin.
[03:14:03.776 --> 03:14:05.318]  That's another thing that little children like.
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:08.642]  Little children also don't like authority.
[03:14:09.003 --> 03:14:10.865]  They don't like adults getting in the way.
[03:14:11.226 --> 03:14:12.527]  That's why they hate the police.
[03:14:12.607 --> 03:14:15.571]  That's why they want to get rid of ICE, immigration enforcement.
[03:14:16.531 --> 03:14:19.972]  If they get rid of immigration enforcement, of course the next target is the police.
[03:14:20.872 --> 03:14:22.992]  Because they don't, little kids don't like rules.
[03:14:23.172 --> 03:14:26.813]  They want to get rid of the people that enforce the rules.
[03:14:27.433 --> 03:14:32.794]  So I think what happened in 2016 is the adults showed up to the polls and we elected an adult.
[03:14:33.674 --> 03:14:37.275]  Trump came and said, okay kids, we need to put some order in the house.
[03:14:37.315 --> 03:14:38.595]  Let's get the economy moving.
[03:14:38.615 --> 03:14:39.835]  Let's fix foreign policy.
[03:14:40.396 --> 03:14:41.736]  You guys have made a big mess.
[03:14:41.796 --> 03:14:42.576]  It's time to clean up.
[03:14:43.570 --> 03:14:46.111]  Now, of course, the Democrats, they don't like these mean adults.
[03:14:46.131 --> 03:14:47.231]  They're taking away our fun.
[03:14:47.591 --> 03:14:48.731]  We wanted to play doctor.
[03:14:48.771 --> 03:14:49.991]  We wanted to play diplomat.
[03:14:50.011 --> 03:14:50.972]  We wanted to ride bikes.
[03:14:51.352 --> 03:14:53.012]  So the Democrats have a big tantrum.
[03:14:53.132 --> 03:14:54.012]  They go out on the streets.
[03:14:54.072 --> 03:14:56.153]  Two million protesters when he's elected.
[03:14:57.073 --> 03:15:01.274]  They say, we don't want to, you know, we don't want to play.
[03:15:01.294 --> 03:15:02.254]  We're not going to play.
[03:15:02.294 --> 03:15:03.094]  We're going to resist.
[03:15:03.114 --> 03:15:05.195]  We're not going to play unless we can have our way.
[03:15:06.090 --> 03:15:09.513]  Our buddy, our best friend, James Hodgkinson, is going to make a big mess.
[03:15:09.613 --> 03:15:10.534]  We love destruction.
[03:15:10.554 --> 03:15:11.895]  You know how little kids love destruction?
[03:15:11.915 --> 03:15:13.056]  We're going to make a big mess.
[03:15:13.617 --> 03:15:17.921]  Until you get out of the room, Mom or Dad, we're going to knock it all down.
[03:15:18.741 --> 03:15:20.883]  And so that's what the Democrats have become today.
[03:15:20.903 --> 03:15:24.827]  A party of little children that want to play health care.
[03:15:24.847 --> 03:15:25.828]  They want to play doctor.
[03:15:25.868 --> 03:15:27.209]  They want to play diplomats.
[03:15:27.249 --> 03:15:30.892]  They want to play all these things that just turn into a big mess.
[03:15:31.813 --> 03:15:32.794]  And one of their
[03:15:33.624 --> 03:15:36.286]  Things that little kids and babies do, they like to lie.
[03:15:36.386 --> 03:15:37.507]  Little kids lie.
[03:15:38.107 --> 03:15:42.850]  And the latest, biggest lie from the little babies, of course, is the Russia hoax.
[03:15:43.691 --> 03:15:49.314]  So when we come back from the break, we're going to talk about the big lie of the children called the Russia hoax.
[03:15:50.015 --> 03:15:52.316]  And we'll be right back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:05.202 --> 03:16:08.203]  I don't sell snake oil, I sell fish oil.
[03:16:09.163 --> 03:16:13.085]  And some of the cleanest, most concentrated out there in footwashstore.com.
[03:16:13.405 --> 03:16:15.786]  There's one thing I take every day and that's fish oil.
[03:16:15.986 --> 03:16:21.868]  And so this has been a couple years in the making because I wasn't just going to go out to one of the big suppliers.
[03:16:22.108 --> 03:16:24.809]  It already cost a lot to have them do the process where it removes the mercury.
[03:16:25.149 --> 03:16:26.749]  We have it at non-detectable levels.
[03:16:26.809 --> 03:16:31.830]  Some spectrometers might pick up a molecule of it or something under California standards, so we don't say mercury-free.
[03:16:31.870 --> 03:16:35.591]  But it's basically the cleanest fish oil, krill oil, you name it, there is.
[03:16:35.991 --> 03:16:37.311]  Because, you know, we don't get it from tuna.
[03:16:37.331 --> 03:16:39.792]  We get it from small fish and things like that, so it doesn't bioaccumulate.
[03:16:39.832 --> 03:16:41.532]  Then they have a program that extracts it out.
[03:16:41.612 --> 03:16:44.773]  But that's the only negative to fish oil and krill oil and things.
[03:16:44.913 --> 03:16:49.734]  We have stuff that, from the top firms in the country, ultimate krill oil, on a roll for your children.
[03:16:50.114 --> 03:16:53.937]  Ultimate fish oil that are so game-changing, it's insane.
[03:16:54.037 --> 03:16:59.942]  I mean, these are big glass bottles with two-month supplies for the price right below leading competitors.
[03:17:00.162 --> 03:17:05.426]  So, X2 is the only thing that gives you the dramatic results within just days that I've seen with these.
[03:17:05.506 --> 03:17:07.127]  This baby's filled right to the top.
[03:17:07.267 --> 03:17:07.587]  Look at that.
[03:17:07.607 --> 03:17:09.529]  I mean, that's as strong as it gets, by the way, too.
[03:17:09.549 --> 03:17:09.889]  Look at that.
[03:17:11.727 --> 03:17:12.468]  We're good to go.
[03:17:31.584 --> 03:17:34.106]  Crill oil is a different formulation, but similar.
[03:18:01.944 --> 03:18:04.587]  This baby right here is the nuclear option.
[03:18:04.667 --> 03:18:05.908]  For your children, you name it.
[03:18:06.068 --> 03:18:09.551]  I mean, you want to give your children the boost they need.
[03:18:09.751 --> 03:18:10.612]  I mean, this is it.
[03:18:10.652 --> 03:18:11.953]  Ladies and gentlemen, just look at it.
[03:18:12.033 --> 03:18:12.514]  Look at that.
[03:18:12.534 --> 03:18:14.496]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[03:18:14.556 --> 03:18:15.977]  That's because it's been denatured.
[03:18:15.997 --> 03:18:16.758]  It's been watered down.
[03:18:17.198 --> 03:18:17.979]  We didn't do that.
[03:18:19.600 --> 03:18:23.724]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[03:18:24.144 --> 03:18:25.766]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[03:18:27.924 --> 03:18:28.525]  That's for me.
[03:18:28.925 --> 03:18:30.126]  Understand the selfishness of this?
[03:18:30.607 --> 03:18:39.115]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[03:18:39.215 --> 03:18:40.877]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[03:18:40.937 --> 03:18:42.018]  Don't you get the big secret?
[03:18:42.098 --> 03:18:42.679]  It's a win-win.
[03:18:42.839 --> 03:18:45.902]  You fund us in the face of the enemies that want to shut down your free speech.
[03:18:46.182 --> 03:18:48.044]  By God, I'm on every channel in the country every day.
[03:18:48.304 --> 03:18:48.925]  Destroy me.
[03:18:48.965 --> 03:18:49.365]  Kill me.
[03:18:49.426 --> 03:18:49.726]  Shut me up.
[03:18:49.986 --> 03:18:50.226]  Why?
[03:18:50.246 --> 03:18:51.688]  The spirit of the world wants to stop us.
[03:18:51.728 --> 03:18:52.149]  Why is that?
[03:18:52.489 --> 03:18:53.831]  It's because we want justice.
[03:18:53.851 --> 03:18:54.852]  We want freedom.
[03:18:54.872 --> 03:18:57.655]  We don't care what color you are, what gender you are, where you're from.
[03:18:57.675 --> 03:18:58.756]  I want you to have a future.
[03:19:02.964 --> 03:19:06.645]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[03:19:06.925 --> 03:19:10.366]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[03:19:10.706 --> 03:19:20.229]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[03:19:20.749 --> 03:19:21.150]  ...study.
[03:19:21.430 --> 03:19:24.193]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[03:19:24.534 --> 03:19:29.499]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[03:19:29.559 --> 03:19:31.922]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[03:19:32.182 --> 03:19:36.847]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[03:19:36.867 --> 03:19:37.448]  Ah, you don't want that.
[03:19:37.848 --> 03:19:41.649]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[03:19:41.869 --> 03:19:44.530]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[03:19:44.810 --> 03:19:48.111]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[03:19:48.472 --> 03:19:53.773]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[03:19:53.853 --> 03:19:57.995]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[03:19:58.855 --> 03:20:01.536]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[03:20:05.555 --> 03:20:11.801]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.724 --> 03:20:16.325]  He's going the distance.
[03:20:17.286 --> 03:20:18.267]  He's going for speed.
[03:20:34.395 --> 03:20:39.260]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:43.203 --> 03:20:44.825]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:45.085 --> 03:20:49.870]  I'm Joel Gilbert, hosting from the People's Republic of California here in Los Angeles.
[03:20:50.390 --> 03:20:51.671]  Thanks for being back with us here.
[03:20:52.532 --> 03:20:54.334]  We'll be taking a lot of calls shortly.
[03:20:54.494 --> 03:20:54.895]  It's 1-800-789-ALEX.
[03:20:58.161 --> 03:21:03.084]  And we're talking about all the lies of the children, how Democrats behave like children.
[03:21:03.104 --> 03:21:07.066]  They like to play doctor, they like to play diplomat, they like to ride bikes, they like to make a mess.
[03:21:07.687 --> 03:21:11.569]  And if they can't get their way, they resist and protest and have a tantrum.
[03:21:12.365 --> 03:21:16.986]  Another big thing that little children do is create big lies.
[03:21:17.066 --> 03:21:19.827]  So the big lie is, of course, the Russia hoax.
[03:21:19.907 --> 03:21:28.529]  The book came out finally, we've been hearing about, Greg Jarrett from Fox News, called The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.
[03:21:29.609 --> 03:21:40.272]  Now, I've been thinking about how the Democrats came up with this hoax, and I think I have some good information and perspective that tells us, reinforces the fact that it is a hoax.
[03:21:40.939 --> 03:21:44.520]  You have to say, well, how did they come up with the idea to frame Donald Trump?
[03:21:45.121 --> 03:21:47.122]  To say, hey, Donald Trump, you're working for the Russians.
[03:21:47.842 --> 03:21:54.144]  Now remember, the Democrats have been up to their ears in Russians and communists for 50 years.
[03:21:55.285 --> 03:21:58.766]  Also remember that socialism is a war on the individual.
[03:21:58.946 --> 03:22:01.708]  It's a war on individualism and individual liberty.
[03:22:02.368 --> 03:22:03.488]  It's about collectivism.
[03:22:03.668 --> 03:22:07.630]  The collective idea is there's one set of rules and one set of beliefs, and that's it.
[03:22:08.391 --> 03:22:10.532]  If you don't believe in it, you're crazy.
[03:22:10.772 --> 03:22:14.092]  That's why they called it being anti-Soviet in the Soviet Union.
[03:22:14.132 --> 03:22:18.393]  If you didn't believe in the collective, you're anti-Soviet and you can end up in a gulag.
[03:22:18.433 --> 03:22:19.234]  They send you away.
[03:22:20.314 --> 03:22:25.535]  So Democrats and progressives really don't have any new ideas since 1917.
[03:22:26.295 --> 03:22:27.816]  So they don't know how to think of ideas.
[03:22:27.836 --> 03:22:28.696]  They're not creative.
[03:22:30.136 --> 03:22:32.577]  They just say, well, the government's going to take all your property.
[03:22:32.597 --> 03:22:34.137]  We're going to control all the industry.
[03:22:34.877 --> 03:22:37.218]  We're going to have a police force to force you to go to work.
[03:22:38.257 --> 03:22:39.938]  And we'll take all the money for ourselves.
[03:22:40.859 --> 03:22:42.640]  And if you object, it's the gulag.
[03:22:42.860 --> 03:22:43.660]  You're going to the gulag.
[03:22:44.561 --> 03:22:49.444]  So, that's why during the Cold War, the progressives loved Joseph Stalin.
[03:22:50.424 --> 03:23:01.170]  As I chronicle in my movie, most people have seen also, Infowars Store, Dreams from My Real Father, I chronicled how Frank Marshall Davis was one of the original black Bolsheviks out of Chicago.
[03:23:01.911 --> 03:23:03.111]  He was sent to Hawaii in 1948
[03:23:04.998 --> 03:23:10.481]  On the orders of the Kremlin to organize a dock worker strike to try to remove the U.S.
[03:23:10.521 --> 03:23:15.423]  naval forces from Hawaii, which the Soviets consider an obstacle to expansion in Asia.
[03:23:16.684 --> 03:23:19.846]  In the 60s, the Weather Underground, SDS, they loved Russia.
[03:23:20.366 --> 03:23:22.247]  They collaborated with Cuban intelligence.
[03:23:23.067 --> 03:23:24.568]  Into the 80s, Ted Kennedy.
[03:23:25.168 --> 03:23:31.972]  It was revealed in the Russian archives that Ted Kennedy tried to work with Russian dictator, former KGB,
[03:23:32.876 --> 03:23:36.718]  Head Yuri Andropov to undermine Ronald Reagan.
[03:23:36.738 --> 03:23:37.618]  It was in the archives.
[03:23:37.638 --> 03:23:40.239]  We can pull up those that article of Ted Kennedy.
[03:23:41.200 --> 03:23:48.023]  And you'll see that it's an actual document that he tried to get the Russians to work with him to undermine Reagan.
[03:23:49.185 --> 03:24:00.293]  Of course, we know that Bernie Sanders, obsessed with loving Russia during the Cold War, all the oppression, the political prisoners, Bernie Sanders thinks it's a great place to honeymoon.
[03:24:00.333 --> 03:24:02.814]  He'll just go honeymoon in the Soviet Union, you know?
[03:24:03.735 --> 03:24:07.217]  So, you see people showing up.
[03:24:07.737 --> 03:24:12.641]  Today, you saw people showing up to, in the last few years, a couple years ago, to Bernie Sanders rallies.
[03:24:13.561 --> 03:24:14.402]  He would say things like,
[03:24:14.997 --> 03:24:16.278]  You know, we're going to break up the banks.
[03:24:16.618 --> 03:24:18.580]  We're going to break up the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:24:19.060 --> 03:24:20.141]  That's pure communism.
[03:24:20.261 --> 03:24:22.683]  It means the government's going to control all these industries.
[03:24:23.144 --> 03:24:27.287]  And of course, state bureaucrats are not as skilled as entrepreneurs.
[03:24:27.307 --> 03:24:29.409]  So all these businesses end up failing.
[03:24:30.009 --> 03:24:31.050]  That's pure communism.
[03:24:31.090 --> 03:24:32.011]  But people would clap.
[03:24:32.131 --> 03:24:35.974]  People clap for Bernie Sanders, even though they had no idea what he was talking about.
[03:24:36.535 --> 03:24:44.081]  And that is a grave danger, that people are voting for people like Sanders and Obama, not knowing the evil idea they have in mind.
[03:24:45.194 --> 03:24:49.195]  And you have to also say, why did they come up with the Russia hoax?
[03:24:49.235 --> 03:24:53.216]  Well, because they thought of it because Obama was controlled by Putin.
[03:24:53.236 --> 03:24:56.377]  Let's take a quick look at this video, Obama Medvedev, back in 2012.
[03:24:56.417 --> 03:24:58.878]  My last lecture, actually, yeah.
[03:24:58.958 --> 03:25:00.859]  After my lecture, I have more questions.
[03:25:00.979 --> 03:25:01.179]  Yeah.
[03:25:01.599 --> 03:25:04.080]  I understand.
[03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:08.001]  I translate this information.
[03:25:11.806 --> 03:25:16.347]  A few months ago, when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia.
[03:25:17.287 --> 03:25:17.927]  Not Al Qaeda.
[03:25:18.308 --> 03:25:18.928]  You said Russia.
[03:25:19.388 --> 03:25:25.809]  And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.
[03:25:26.910 --> 03:25:28.690]  Okay, so that's Obama.
[03:25:28.730 --> 03:25:29.270]  Let's cut it off.
[03:25:29.290 --> 03:25:35.332]  That's Obama showing that he's going to cooperate with Russia.
[03:25:35.552 --> 03:25:36.472]  And so you gotta ask,
[03:25:37.125 --> 03:25:40.047]  When he tells Medvedev, I'll be more flexible after the election.
[03:25:40.288 --> 03:25:42.349]  That should have been a special counsel.
[03:25:42.449 --> 03:25:43.770]  Trump never did anything like that.
[03:25:44.431 --> 03:25:51.056]  But it shows he's under the control of Putin because Obama was the most pro-Russia president in his first term.
[03:25:51.096 --> 03:25:54.098]  He canceled the missile defense shield in Eastern Europe.
[03:25:54.378 --> 03:25:55.059]  He reset
[03:25:55.951 --> 03:25:57.731]  Gave technology transfers to Russia.
[03:25:58.212 --> 03:26:06.053]  Leaving from behind, that means America does not lead the world, lead the free world, allowing Russia to fill the vacuum in the balance of power.
[03:26:06.093 --> 03:26:07.093]  They invaded Crimea.
[03:26:07.354 --> 03:26:08.794]  They set up a base in Syria.
[03:26:09.214 --> 03:26:10.434]  Obama made the Iran deal.
[03:26:10.794 --> 03:26:12.135]  This is all pro-Russia.
[03:26:12.155 --> 03:26:13.335]  It all benefits Russia.
[03:26:13.815 --> 03:26:16.376]  So Obama was the most pro-Russia president.
[03:26:16.436 --> 03:26:23.037]  And I think I even said at the National Press Club in 2012 that it was dangerous for an American president to maintain a secret
[03:26:23.786 --> 03:26:26.188]  That if it came out, it would ruin his political career.
[03:26:26.468 --> 03:26:36.974]  If I could figure out that his real father was a Russian agent, Frank Marshall Davis, who radicalized him, then the KGB that had a file on Davis also figured it out.
[03:26:37.034 --> 03:26:38.495]  So that's the real Russia hoax.
[03:26:39.196 --> 03:26:41.857]  And that's where the Democrats got the idea from.
[03:26:41.977 --> 03:26:43.758]  Our guy's been controlled by the Russians.
[03:26:44.659 --> 03:26:46.060]  We've been in bed with the Russians.
[03:26:46.820 --> 03:26:49.242]  Wouldn't it be funny if we said that Trump does that?
[03:26:49.930 --> 03:26:51.431]  So, that's how it all came about.
[03:26:51.471 --> 03:26:55.032]  That's the mentality, and that's their inability to come up with creative ideas.
[03:26:55.072 --> 03:26:56.853]  They just had to say, well, here's what we do.
[03:26:58.814 --> 03:27:02.535]  You know, and the reason they don't like Russia today is because they're not communists.
[03:27:02.895 --> 03:27:05.937]  They liked Russia a lot better when they were communists.
[03:27:05.957 --> 03:27:11.259]  When it was government control, government owns all the property, you don't agree with the government, you go to prison.
[03:27:11.899 --> 03:27:14.200]  That's when they were infatuated with Russia.
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:18.602]  They don't like Putin because he's bringing back capitalism, free markets,
[03:27:19.361 --> 03:27:21.922]  Traditional values and Christianity.
[03:27:23.762 --> 03:27:24.463]  They don't like that.
[03:27:24.543 --> 03:27:26.043]  They don't like Russia very much anymore.
[03:27:26.723 --> 03:27:34.746]  So that's the real story of where the Democrats are coming from with this whole Russia idea and what's motivating them and where their ideas come from.
[03:27:36.526 --> 03:27:40.247]  Today, they're back to being openly radical, openly radical Democrat Party.
[03:27:40.828 --> 03:27:41.908]  They were hiding it for a while.
[03:27:42.953 --> 03:27:45.695]  We're going to take a bunch more phone calls the rest of the way, the rest of the hour.
[03:27:45.715 --> 03:27:47.797]  800-789-ALEX.
[03:27:47.817 --> 03:27:48.918]  1-800-789-ALEX.
[03:27:49.138 --> 03:27:52.661]  Let me take my first call, Dr. Kelly in NorCal.
[03:27:52.681 --> 03:27:53.722]  Go ahead, Dr. Kelly.
[03:27:59.447 --> 03:28:02.389]  Hey, thank you so much for your work and for taking my call.
[03:28:02.550 --> 03:28:08.535]  I have three really important documentaries that I need to figure out how to get out.
[03:28:09.415 --> 03:28:09.876]  One of them
[03:28:10.615 --> 03:28:21.164]  is on the cellular towers and or the disguised weaponized mono pine m-o-n-o-p-i-n-e here in California.
[03:28:22.325 --> 03:28:32.493]  Apparently they're now being deployed on utility trucks by Verizon, AT&T, and no public notice of any kind.
[03:28:32.673 --> 03:28:34.455]  No signage, no nothing.
[03:28:37.217 --> 03:28:38.258]  I need to know how to do this.
[03:28:40.066 --> 03:28:42.668]  Okay, well, you've got some concerns.
[03:28:42.688 --> 03:28:45.831]  You should definitely keep reading about them and writing about them.
[03:28:46.792 --> 03:28:49.414]  We're going to be right back in about a couple of minutes.
[03:28:49.434 --> 03:28:51.256]  We're going to take only your calls the rest of the way.
[03:28:51.276 --> 03:28:56.300]  We've got Wesley, we've got Judy, Jim, and Andrew standing by.
[03:28:56.360 --> 03:28:58.602]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:04.113 --> 03:29:22.422]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:29:22.523 --> 03:29:28.426]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:29:28.806 --> 03:29:29.486]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:29:29.586 --> 03:29:32.748]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:29:33.408 --> 03:29:34.369]  And so much more.
[03:29:34.949 --> 03:29:36.070]  It is concentrated.
[03:29:36.290 --> 03:29:38.011]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:29:38.031 --> 03:29:43.715]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:29:43.835 --> 03:29:45.036]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:29:45.056 --> 03:29:46.977]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:29:47.077 --> 03:29:49.439]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:29:49.659 --> 03:29:50.920]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:29:51.100 --> 03:29:52.901]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:29:53.461 --> 03:29:54.062]  Immune Wall.
[03:29:54.162 --> 03:29:56.764]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:30:05.478 --> 03:30:06.799]  The killing of Uncle Sam.
[03:30:06.879 --> 03:30:08.159]  I just read it a few weeks ago.
[03:30:08.660 --> 03:30:11.781]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, one of the bravest preachers in the world.
[03:30:12.221 --> 03:30:15.203]  Of course, he's an American, but he grew up in South Africa.
[03:30:15.223 --> 03:30:17.604]  And we're just really, really pleased to have him.
[03:30:17.644 --> 03:30:19.625]  The demise of the United States of America.
[03:30:19.665 --> 03:30:21.286]  Now, he gave us 500 books.
[03:30:21.346 --> 03:30:22.306]  I've ordered 1,000 more.
[03:30:22.326 --> 03:30:23.107]  They're coming in next week.
[03:30:23.147 --> 03:30:24.848]  It starts shipping next Tuesday.
[03:30:24.908 --> 03:30:30.751]  But he does have audiobooks on CD and Audible.com that also start coming out next week.
[03:30:30.771 --> 03:30:31.671]  So we'll be selling those.
[03:30:31.691 --> 03:30:35.073]  But I don't care where you get them, just be sure and
[03:30:35.473 --> 03:30:35.874]  Get them.
[03:30:36.174 --> 03:30:42.101]  I feel in my gut, but also historically, and you see this biblically, God gives people one last chance, and to turn it around.
[03:30:42.121 --> 03:30:45.786]  So people think, oh, it's Providence, he's divinely inspired, you know, he can't be stopped.
[03:30:45.866 --> 03:30:46.447]  I don't agree with that.
[03:30:46.467 --> 03:30:53.716]  I think if we don't back Trump, if we aren't strong, if we don't pray, if we're not active, if we're not courageous, I think God will step aside and let this whole thing fall.
[03:30:53.976 --> 03:30:55.396]  This is a last minute reprieve.
[03:30:55.456 --> 03:31:01.858]  In actual fact, Dr. Paul Williams, when we were writing this, he said, I want the last chapter to be called The Reign of Jezebel.
[03:31:02.238 --> 03:31:04.558]  And I looked at him and said, absolutely not.
[03:31:05.118 --> 03:31:05.819]  Absolutely not.
[03:31:05.899 --> 03:31:06.799]  She's not getting in.
[03:31:07.179 --> 03:31:09.859]  He said, she, she, there's no way she's not going to win.
[03:31:10.199 --> 03:31:12.240]  I said, she is not going to get in.
[03:31:12.600 --> 03:31:16.261]  We've had all night premiums at the church, you know, and I didn't support Trump.
[03:31:16.321 --> 03:31:17.201]  I knew Trump was going to win.
[03:31:17.461 --> 03:31:22.102]  Yeah, I didn't support him as a Republican or Democrat because both Republican and Democrat are wicked.
[03:31:22.222 --> 03:31:26.903]  I supported him because he was an outsider and was not funded by the globalists to come.
[03:31:27.023 --> 03:31:29.684]  And you could see that genuinely the globalists hate him.
[03:31:30.444 --> 03:31:30.824]  In a way.
[03:31:31.044 --> 03:31:32.205]  The Pope is against him.
[03:31:32.585 --> 03:31:35.225]  The world's financial elite and Davos is against him.
[03:31:35.565 --> 03:31:36.846]  The former Mexican...
[03:31:38.206 --> 03:31:40.670]  You know, President is against it, everybody.
[03:31:40.690 --> 03:31:43.954]  I said, okay, well that tells you who he's supposed to support right there.
[03:31:44.054 --> 03:31:46.077]  And I feel that we've got this window.
[03:31:46.458 --> 03:31:48.701]  God has granted us a last minute reprieve.
[03:31:49.001 --> 03:31:49.842]  It's not over yet.
[03:31:49.982 --> 03:31:53.587]  Because let me tell you, back in 07, I said to the Lord, tell me, is it too late?
[03:31:54.108 --> 03:31:55.249]  Yeah, it's 07.08.
[03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.829]  Is it too late?
[03:31:56.129 --> 03:31:57.710]  I'll tell the people, because I'm on the line to them.
[03:31:57.770 --> 03:32:06.976]  I'll tell them, hey, so it's over and put yourself in the brace position like they tell you on the aircraft, which is not a good thing, because that means you're trying to get your head as close to your butt.
[03:32:06.996 --> 03:32:08.136]  So it's your head between your knees?
[03:32:08.276 --> 03:32:11.238]  You can kiss it goodbye, you know, it's like we're going down, you know.
[03:32:11.618 --> 03:32:14.020]  So, you know, the Lord said to me, it's not too late.
[03:32:14.540 --> 03:32:15.941]  And God is waiting on us.
[03:32:16.241 --> 03:32:17.481]  He's waiting on us to stand up.
[03:32:17.842 --> 03:32:21.483]  And I want to just say this, you know, I feel the Lord's hand of protection is on you.
[03:32:21.844 --> 03:32:23.704]  If they were going to take you out, they would have taken you out.
[03:32:23.744 --> 03:32:31.328]  They're not going to touch you, because of the blood of Jesus that protects you, the angels of God that encamp about you, your wife, your children, and everything that you touch.
[03:32:31.588 --> 03:32:33.249]  So don't, don't get frustrated.
[03:32:33.289 --> 03:32:35.270]  Know that the Lord, there's a God in heaven.
[03:32:35.610 --> 03:32:36.931]  And you know, He's about you.
[03:32:36.951 --> 03:32:38.772]  He said, I'll be about you as a wall of fire.
[03:32:39.252 --> 03:32:39.932]  I feel it.
[03:32:40.352 --> 03:32:41.573]  I just feel like I'm doing good enough.
[03:32:41.713 --> 03:32:42.053]  No, no.
[03:32:42.373 --> 03:32:43.454]  Alex, it's not about that.
[03:32:43.494 --> 03:32:44.334]  You're doing your best.
[03:32:44.595 --> 03:32:45.195]  Here's the thing.
[03:32:45.275 --> 03:32:46.896]  Everybody must do what they can.
[03:32:47.136 --> 03:32:48.517]  Everybody does their best.
[03:32:48.797 --> 03:32:51.939]  And at the end of the day, God takes our best and he multiplies it.
[03:32:51.959 --> 03:32:52.099]  I know.
[03:32:52.159 --> 03:32:53.139]  I can feel God's strength.
[03:32:53.439 --> 03:32:55.340]  I just can't believe that other people don't see it.
[03:32:55.520 --> 03:33:00.623]  Yeah, but that's why I'm going to preach the gospel to them so that they can experience the power of the Holy Spirit.
[03:33:06.486 --> 03:33:09.108]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.131 --> 03:33:37.933]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:40.754 --> 03:33:42.475]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:42.795 --> 03:33:46.976]  Joel Gilbert broadcasting from the People's Republic of California.
[03:33:47.796 --> 03:33:49.217]  Don't forget, in the Alex Jones
[03:33:50.052 --> 03:33:52.652]  Store, Trump the Art of the Insult, my new movie.
[03:33:52.772 --> 03:33:58.453]  You'll laugh for 95 minutes and you'll learn a lot about Trump's branding and marketing techniques.
[03:33:58.473 --> 03:33:59.754]  You'll really enjoy this movie.
[03:34:00.214 --> 03:34:01.754]  Buy it from the Infowars store.
[03:34:02.214 --> 03:34:03.534]  You'll be taking calls the rest of the way.
[03:34:03.574 --> 03:34:05.415]  Let's go to Judy in Florida.
[03:34:05.975 --> 03:34:07.415]  Judy, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:09.075 --> 03:34:10.556]  Hi Mr. Gilbert.
[03:34:11.076 --> 03:34:12.116]  I'd have two things.
[03:34:12.596 --> 03:34:19.177]  The first is I think whether anyone comes from a Christian perspective or if they're atheist.
[03:34:19.815 --> 03:34:24.956]  I think they should go to 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2 and read it in its entirety.
[03:34:25.516 --> 03:34:29.577]  It explains a lot of, I think, what's happening current day.
[03:34:31.298 --> 03:34:46.501]  But really what I wanted to get to was, I think, the tripwire for the Deep State, George Soros, the left, of getting this war started that they want so badly.
[03:34:47.182 --> 03:35:07.171]  There's going to be a peaceful event that leftists will turn around and infiltrate and start a big fight, and someone from out of nowhere is going to come from behind the conservative Christian, the right crowd, and it's going to be an AR-15 or something like that, and there's going to be casualties.
[03:35:07.211 --> 03:35:08.792]  Okay, alright, thanks for the call.
[03:35:08.852 --> 03:35:09.272]  Thanks for the call.
[03:35:09.292 --> 03:35:09.893]  Let me comment.
[03:35:09.933 --> 03:35:12.054]  Look, the Democrats, the
[03:35:13.106 --> 03:35:18.660]  Progressives have always relied on strife, on strife between communities, on conflict.
[03:35:19.178 --> 03:35:22.500]  So they can say, well, let me solve the problem for you.
[03:35:22.880 --> 03:35:29.503]  If everybody's going to church and working and traditional values and people are happy, there's no justification for radical change.
[03:35:30.024 --> 03:35:35.146]  So they have to create chaos in order to justify that they can take power.
[03:35:35.507 --> 03:35:43.211]  You mentioned that George Soros, of course, longtime agitator, funder, originally a Nazi collaborator that
[03:35:44.471 --> 03:35:46.472]  People don't even know the deep history of this.
[03:35:46.492 --> 03:35:51.956]  He was one of the few Nazi collaborators not to be executed by the Soviets when he was captured.
[03:35:52.516 --> 03:36:00.981]  Lo and behold, he shows up in London a few years later selling stolen art that was taken by the Nazis from Jewish people.
[03:36:02.462 --> 03:36:06.665]  The connection of how he survived and how he got so rich and how he
[03:36:07.748 --> 03:36:22.586]  You know, embarked on a campaign to destroy Western civilization, literally, starting with trying to collapse the British pound in the 80s, I think has to be examined and tied back to his relationship with the Russians when they captured him.
[03:36:23.127 --> 03:36:25.810]  Don't forget, when he was 14, the Nazis gave him a choice.
[03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:27.192]  You can die or you can work for us.
[03:36:27.910 --> 03:36:32.353]  So I wouldn't be surprised if that was the choice he was given by the Russians.
[03:36:32.873 --> 03:36:35.014]  And that's why he's done everything he's done up to today.
[03:36:35.254 --> 03:36:36.855]  Let's go to Wesley in Oregon.
[03:36:37.035 --> 03:36:38.216]  Wesley, I'm sorry.
[03:36:38.236 --> 03:36:38.897]  Yeah, you're in Oregon.
[03:36:38.937 --> 03:36:39.557]  Go ahead, Wesley.
[03:36:41.678 --> 03:36:42.219]  Hello, Joel.
[03:36:42.279 --> 03:36:44.920]  How are you doing?
[03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:46.341]  Hello?
[03:36:46.361 --> 03:36:46.701]  Yes, sir.
[03:36:46.721 --> 03:36:47.181]  Go ahead.
[03:36:48.922 --> 03:36:52.805]  Well, first thing I'd like to say is I bought products from InfoWars.
[03:36:53.025 --> 03:36:54.646]  I have my Alpha Power sitting here.
[03:36:54.666 --> 03:36:56.507]  I have my Caveman and all that.
[03:36:57.708 --> 03:37:06.816]  I'm going to the rally on the 4th with my I Stand With Trump shirt, and I just bought $100 worth of Super Blue Crocs and whatnot.
[03:37:07.316 --> 03:37:16.063]  But anyway, the thing I wanted to talk about was, I cannot even see Donald Trump's recent tweet on his Twitter when I go directly to his Twitter.
[03:37:17.024 --> 03:37:25.751]  And I don't know if this is happening everywhere, but the only thing I can see from two days ago, the Russian Hoax tweet.
[03:37:27.458 --> 03:37:29.059]  That is the only thing I can see anyway.
[03:37:40.580 --> 03:37:41.901]  To control thought.
[03:37:42.161 --> 03:37:43.322]  To control what people think.
[03:37:43.382 --> 03:37:44.483]  Control what they say.
[03:37:45.023 --> 03:37:46.064]  Control the agenda.
[03:37:46.525 --> 03:37:47.766]  Of course, control the elections.
[03:37:47.946 --> 03:37:50.568]  People forget 2012 was not a clean election.
[03:37:50.628 --> 03:37:57.773]  Obama used the IRS to break up the Tea Party movement so he could win re-election because his economy and his ideas weren't working.
[03:37:58.474 --> 03:37:59.475]  Same thing, repeat, 2016.
[03:38:00.676 --> 03:38:03.938]  He used the DOJ, FBI, CIA to try to defeat Trump.
[03:38:04.739 --> 03:38:06.160]  And in case he won, to frame him.
[03:38:06.886 --> 03:38:08.147]  So this is their playbook.
[03:38:08.627 --> 03:38:16.633]  Now that they're out of power, they're trying to use their connections and their sympathizers in industry, whether it's Twitter, Google, Amazon.
[03:38:17.254 --> 03:38:23.798]  I did a show earlier this year regarding Amazon, that Amazon did not make money.
[03:38:23.838 --> 03:38:26.840]  They just barely broke even until a couple years ago.
[03:38:26.900 --> 03:38:35.667]  They paid Bezos from the CIA, gave a $600 million contract, no bid, illegal, to Bezos to design a website
[03:38:36.283 --> 03:38:39.186]  For the CIA, $600 million.
[03:38:39.226 --> 03:38:45.932]  He turned around a week later and bought the Washington Post for $250 million, which, of course, is a big sympathizer.
[03:38:45.952 --> 03:38:47.793]  And all of a sudden, he's the richest guy in the world.
[03:38:47.813 --> 03:38:56.481]  So don't think there's not a strong connection to the deep state, what I call the police state, and all these big industries, especially the tech industries.
[03:38:57.081 --> 03:38:58.863]  And Twitter is just another one of them.
[03:38:59.303 --> 03:39:03.127]  And they're going to use their tools to suppress the free speech, suppress
[03:39:04.039 --> 03:39:05.700]  opinion that differs with them.
[03:39:06.180 --> 03:39:14.446]  It's a very sick, evil plan to destroy free speech, to destroy the elements of the Constitution that make America great.
[03:39:15.026 --> 03:39:24.813]  And we're seeing this assault, instead of coming from the government, from Obama and his deep state departments, DOJ, it's coming from, now it's transferred to the tech industry.
[03:39:25.213 --> 03:39:27.594]  Let's go to Jim in Rhode Island.
[03:39:27.634 --> 03:39:29.436]  We got you on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:39:29.476 --> 03:39:30.036]  Jim, go ahead.
[03:39:31.624 --> 03:39:32.605]  Yes, how you doing, Joe?
[03:39:33.486 --> 03:39:34.907]  I've got a quick question for you.
[03:39:35.507 --> 03:39:37.929]  Do you think the United States is an empire?
[03:39:39.591 --> 03:39:40.551]  I think it's an empire.
[03:39:41.152 --> 03:39:47.157]  I think after World War II, the United States had been through two world wars in, you know, 25 years.
[03:39:47.977 --> 03:39:50.980]  There was a decision that was made that the United States needs to
[03:39:52.393 --> 03:39:52.773]  I think?
[03:40:07.583 --> 03:40:15.849]  Trying to combat and prevent regional wars and regional madmen from dragging America into a world war.
[03:40:16.249 --> 03:40:27.316]  So this is how I think that concept developed that America felt we're better off stationing and preventing conflicts and fighting small conflicts than we are entering another world war.
[03:40:27.817 --> 03:40:32.460]  So that's how the idea developed that America would project its power around the world to maintain the peace.
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:35.282]  I think it can be thought of
[03:40:37.068 --> 03:40:45.912]  You know, in that way, I don't think it's an empire is someone that really projects their power in order to control and take over countries and manage their affairs.
[03:40:46.672 --> 03:40:57.437]  I think sometimes America has delved into that, but it's not the the main goal is to is to maintain peace and security throughout the world for the benefit of the United States as well as as well as our allies.
[03:40:58.097 --> 03:41:01.038]  Let's go to Wyatt in California.
[03:41:01.058 --> 03:41:03.479]  And by the way, don't forget, it's 1-800-789-ALEX.
[03:41:06.221 --> 03:41:09.262]  Taking calls the rest of the way, 1-800-789-ALEX.
[03:41:10.022 --> 03:41:11.883]  Go ahead, Wyatt, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:41:12.903 --> 03:41:13.724]  Yeah, it is up to today.
[03:41:13.764 --> 03:41:14.944]  I completely agree with you.
[03:41:15.104 --> 03:41:22.146]  These people being utter children, it seems kind of hard to believe that they're, in a sense, even beating us at this point.
[03:41:22.787 --> 03:41:27.988]  They have to destroy our free speech because in an open debate, they just can't win.
[03:41:28.028 --> 03:41:30.649]  Adults can't be beat by children.
[03:41:31.650 --> 03:41:32.510]  And that's essentially
[03:41:33.211 --> 03:41:36.695]  What they're trying to do, and they're acting very childish, and it's really sad.
[03:41:36.715 --> 03:41:39.398]  It's like a 30-year-old.
[03:41:39.759 --> 03:41:42.963]  It's like what used to be an 18-year-old is now a 30-year-old.
[03:41:42.983 --> 03:41:45.325]  We're like, uh, erected developmentally.
[03:41:45.726 --> 03:41:52.414]  Yeah, look, the entire reaction to Trump being elected, the next day they had a 2 million person tantrum.
[03:41:53.215 --> 03:41:55.997]  Madonna, everybody else screaming, oh, that's not my president.
[03:41:56.438 --> 03:41:57.439]  I'm not going to play.
[03:41:57.899 --> 03:42:01.682]  I'm not going to play anymore because you are now in charge.
[03:42:02.042 --> 03:42:03.783]  We liked it when we could play doctor.
[03:42:03.843 --> 03:42:04.904]  We could play Obamacare.
[03:42:04.944 --> 03:42:07.046]  We could play Veterans Administration.
[03:42:07.546 --> 03:42:09.868]  We could play diplomats.
[03:42:10.409 --> 03:42:11.990]  We could go play footsie with the Russians.
[03:42:12.030 --> 03:42:13.411]  We liked it when we were in control.
[03:42:13.951 --> 03:42:21.137]  So the entire, what you hear now, it's just every time Adam Schiff opens his mouth, his lips are moving, he's lying.
[03:42:21.900 --> 03:42:22.920]  And that's what little kids do.
[03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:23.600]  They lie.
[03:42:23.981 --> 03:42:25.001]  They don't cooperate.
[03:42:25.041 --> 03:42:25.901]  They have a tantrum.
[03:42:26.601 --> 03:42:40.725]  And that's what the Democrat Party has come to, is just a group of lying, uncooperative children that want to resist and refuse to participate unless they can control.
[03:42:40.765 --> 03:42:42.386]  They don't like the adults that are in the room.
[03:42:42.486 --> 03:42:43.586]  Donald Trump's an adult.
[03:42:44.582 --> 03:42:45.963]  They don't like it when there's adults around.
[03:42:45.983 --> 03:42:46.743]  Get rid of the police.
[03:42:46.783 --> 03:42:47.683]  Get rid of the borders.
[03:42:48.123 --> 03:42:48.784]  Let's have fun.
[03:42:48.824 --> 03:42:49.624]  Let's have a party.
[03:42:50.744 --> 03:42:53.305]  Doesn't matter that they destroyed the economy under Obama.
[03:42:53.986 --> 03:42:57.027]  And we do have an incredible recovery thanks to Donald Trump.
[03:42:57.287 --> 03:42:58.427]  Be right back for the next segment.
[03:42:58.447 --> 03:42:59.148]  We'll take more calls.
[03:42:59.168 --> 03:42:59.288]  800-789-ALEX.
[03:43:06.585 --> 03:43:12.087]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:43:12.307 --> 03:43:19.909]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:43:20.189 --> 03:43:23.350]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:43:23.530 --> 03:43:28.633]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:43:28.813 --> 03:43:31.335]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.

[03:44:07.150 --> 03:44:10.231]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:44:10.271 --> 03:44:10.791]  You're on the air.
[03:44:10.811 --> 03:44:11.971]  Thanks for holding.
[03:44:11.991 --> 03:44:12.851]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:44:13.031 --> 03:44:13.651]  Hey, brother.
[03:44:13.951 --> 03:44:14.311]  Good, man.
[03:44:14.331 --> 03:44:15.131]  Thank you for calling.
[03:44:15.231 --> 03:44:15.751]  Hey, hey.
[03:44:15.872 --> 03:44:20.272]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:44:20.512 --> 03:44:26.853]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:44:26.873 --> 03:44:28.694]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[03:44:28.794 --> 03:44:34.955]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:44:36.215 --> 03:44:37.216]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:44:37.276 --> 03:44:41.300]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:43.362]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:44:43.742 --> 03:44:44.483]  And exactly.
[03:44:44.503 --> 03:44:48.767]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:44:49.087 --> 03:44:49.367]  Boom!
[03:44:49.507 --> 03:44:52.330]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:44:52.390 --> 03:44:52.930]  It's amazing.
[03:44:52.970 --> 03:44:57.214]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:45:02.768 --> 03:45:07.813]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:45:07.953 --> 03:45:12.698]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver.
[03:45:12.898 --> 03:45:16.241]  That is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:45:16.301 --> 03:45:19.164]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked.
[03:45:19.284 --> 03:45:25.046]  We're first aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and second degree burns, skin irritations.
[03:45:25.246 --> 03:45:27.486]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[03:45:27.606 --> 03:45:29.907]  Some medical grade stores have it.
[03:45:30.107 --> 03:45:31.567]  It's just incredible.
[03:45:31.647 --> 03:45:32.547]  It's $29.95 out of the gate.
[03:45:32.627 --> 03:45:33.828]  This is next level.
[03:45:33.888 --> 03:45:35.408]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[03:45:35.948 --> 03:45:38.229]  It's just a little bit less strong than the
[03:45:38.769 --> 03:45:40.090]  Prescription silver.
[03:45:40.430 --> 03:45:44.852]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:45:44.972 --> 03:45:48.434]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:45:48.594 --> 03:45:49.854]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:45:49.995 --> 03:45:56.798]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist, and we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals.
[03:45:57.478 --> 03:46:01.880]  And he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[03:46:02.140 --> 03:46:04.962]  Infullrestore.com, Infullrestlife.com, or 888-533-139.
[03:46:07.583 --> 03:46:11.524]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff.
[03:46:11.964 --> 03:46:14.105]  I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[03:46:14.605 --> 03:46:18.866]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[03:46:19.246 --> 03:46:19.726]  This is it.
[03:46:20.006 --> 03:46:22.427]  There's only one other silver stronger, and it's by prescription.
[03:46:22.527 --> 03:46:24.207]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[03:46:24.408 --> 03:46:24.948]  Nanotech.
[03:46:25.148 --> 03:46:28.969]  Super small particles which, going electromagnetically, just goes right to the heart of something.
[03:46:31.442 --> 03:46:40.625]  Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel contains the powerful Silver Sol technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano silver market.
[03:46:40.825 --> 03:46:53.569]  As the only FDA certified wound treatment product of its kind, this gel has been shown to fight infection and irritation while also helping speed up the healing process.
[03:46:53.770 --> 03:46:55.950]  And that's the way I like it.
[03:46:56.030 --> 03:47:00.992]  Grab a bottle of Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel right now and in full war's life,
[03:47:06.023 --> 03:47:08.609]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:29.033 --> 03:47:32.035]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:47:32.595 --> 03:47:36.678]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:47:40.221 --> 03:47:41.882]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:41.942 --> 03:47:44.403]  Joel Gilbert with you for the last segment.
[03:47:45.384 --> 03:47:48.406]  Right from the left coast from the People's Republic of California.
[03:47:48.426 --> 03:47:50.948]  I am taking calls the rest of the way.
[03:47:50.968 --> 03:47:53.049]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:47:53.589 --> 03:47:58.673]  I mentioned that next Monday, there's going to be a special by Jay-Z called Rest in Power about Trayvon Martin.
[03:47:59.272 --> 03:48:01.033]  And I talked about how suspect it was.
[03:48:01.254 --> 03:48:12.102]  Again, they're trying to bring this up before an election to try to agitate, to try to inflame emotions, especially of African-Americans, to try to vote Democrat.
[03:48:12.162 --> 03:48:14.063]  That's the game that we see again and again.
[03:48:14.583 --> 03:48:16.905]  But let's take a call from John in Seattle.
[03:48:17.486 --> 03:48:18.046]  Go ahead, John.
[03:48:18.086 --> 03:48:20.068]  You're on Alex Jones Show.
[03:48:21.168 --> 03:48:21.549]  Hi, Joe.
[03:48:21.589 --> 03:48:22.489]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:48:23.832 --> 03:48:38.820]  I just wanted to mention that, uh, he didn't mention, but, uh, the night of, uh, the Trayvon's death, he was, uh, peeking through windows, and there was a bunch of robberies in that, uh, complex, and that was never really highlighted, but it, it was a fact, and it was very suspicious.
[03:48:39.240 --> 03:48:52.968]  Um, also wanted to mention that my buddy was the, uh, news reporter who, uh, misreported on that, Jeff Burnside, and he, uh, he, uh, he got fired because of it, and, um, you know, he was kind of a sacrificial lamb, it seems.
[03:48:53.695 --> 03:48:55.656]  And I just wanted to just pass that along.
[03:48:56.656 --> 03:48:57.116]  Okay, thanks.
[03:48:57.436 --> 03:48:59.337]  Yeah, look, it was a very tragic story.
[03:48:59.517 --> 03:49:02.218]  Trayvon Martin, 17-year-old kid in high school.
[03:49:02.739 --> 03:49:04.639]  He had been in and out of some trouble.
[03:49:05.460 --> 03:49:07.560]  I guess this neighborhood had a lot of crime.
[03:49:07.961 --> 03:49:13.243]  George Zimmerman saw him kind of hanging around, and he thought he better report it, as he was told to do.
[03:49:13.303 --> 03:49:18.024]  If people remember the case, it's five-year anniversary of that tragic, tragic story.
[03:49:20.659 --> 03:49:22.660]  Yeah, apparently Trayvon Martin had been in some trouble.
[03:49:22.880 --> 03:49:31.583]  When I look at his history, it's very tragic and very similar to a lot of black youth that there's no employment.
[03:49:32.443 --> 03:49:38.866]  I think he'd been in and out of drug issues, suspended from school, his parents were divorced.
[03:49:39.426 --> 03:49:43.727]  Very typical of what the Democrat Party has brought to the black community for 50 years.
[03:49:43.747 --> 03:49:44.868]  They've been in control of these
[03:49:45.583 --> 03:49:55.071]  Progressive cities for 50, 60 years, violent culture, drug culture, single women, broken homes.
[03:49:55.671 --> 03:49:56.732]  It was just very tragic.
[03:49:56.772 --> 03:50:05.038]  You just got to wonder that if Trayvon Martin had any opportunities, what if Donald Trump was president and not Obama?
[03:50:05.099 --> 03:50:07.320]  During Obama, there were no jobs.
[03:50:07.981 --> 03:50:08.761]  They were trying to
[03:50:09.870 --> 03:50:17.892]  You know, bring in illegals, knock down the borders, to bring them into these urban communities, to take jobs from black people, to drive down the wages.
[03:50:18.432 --> 03:50:21.733]  I wonder if Donald Trump was president, Trayvon Martin would have had some opportunity.
[03:50:21.793 --> 03:50:24.793]  Right now there's more jobs than there are people to fill them.
[03:50:25.313 --> 03:50:28.754]  It was the opposite back in 2012, after four years of Obama.
[03:50:29.254 --> 03:50:33.315]  So you just wonder, Trayvon Martin is probably someone who would rather have a job.
[03:50:33.335 --> 03:50:36.916]  But when I did my movie, There's No Place Like Utopia, I went to South Side Chicago,
[03:50:38.010 --> 03:50:40.231]  Everybody there talked to a lot of black people on welfare.
[03:50:41.011 --> 03:50:42.112]  And they didn't want to be on welfare.
[03:50:42.132 --> 03:50:44.453]  They wanted a job, but there was no opportunity.
[03:50:45.033 --> 03:50:46.634]  So think about that when you watch it.
[03:50:46.654 --> 03:50:53.677]  I would tune in to the BET or Paramount Network on Monday for that Jay-Z documentary.
[03:50:54.097 --> 03:51:00.180]  Definitely watch it and see what kind of political agenda there is, or if they really do tell the true story.
[03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:02.141]  Let's go to another caller.
[03:51:03.041 --> 03:51:03.861]  Adam in Florida.
[03:51:03.881 --> 03:51:06.783]  Hey, Joe.
[03:51:06.863 --> 03:51:07.263]  Can you hear me?
[03:51:08.228 --> 03:51:09.809]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[03:51:09.849 --> 03:51:11.250]  Hey, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[03:51:11.351 --> 03:51:15.794]  I've watched some of your films, particularly Dreams from My Real Father.
[03:51:16.774 --> 03:51:17.435]  Okay, thanks.
[03:51:17.855 --> 03:51:29.303]  I enjoyed it very much, and I wanted to give kind of credit to Obama where it's due because, you know, he's the only president I can remember that ever let me see naked pictures of his mother.
[03:51:30.584 --> 03:51:33.606]  And, um... Well, yeah, there are... Go ahead, go ahead.
[03:51:34.696 --> 03:51:39.398]  I wanted to ask you in particular, though, where did you get the original seed for that movie?
[03:51:39.538 --> 03:51:44.941]  Like, you know, like, how did you get the idea that he might be?
[03:51:44.961 --> 03:51:45.181]  Okay.
[03:51:46.201 --> 03:51:47.041]  Well, thanks for asking.
[03:51:47.121 --> 03:51:53.944]  Like, you know, back in 2012, I was following InfoWars, WorldNetDaily, and I kept reading about the birth certificate.
[03:51:54.505 --> 03:51:55.925]  Everybody said, where's the birth certificate?
[03:51:55.945 --> 03:51:56.986]  Where's the birth certificate?
[03:51:57.046 --> 03:51:58.006]  And there was no answer.
[03:51:58.507 --> 03:52:04.009]  And I always knew that if you, if you don't know the answer to the question, it means you're not asking the right question.
[03:52:04.761 --> 03:52:06.222]  They're not asking the right question.
[03:52:06.802 --> 03:52:13.247]  So I read Obama's autobiography, Dreams from My Father, and throughout the entire book he talks about Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:52:13.607 --> 03:52:14.868]  Frank is his go-to guy.
[03:52:14.908 --> 03:52:15.969]  This guy raised him.
[03:52:16.750 --> 03:52:20.953]  And so I went and found a book by Frank Marshall Davis called Live in the Blues.
[03:52:21.393 --> 03:52:24.995]  And you open the book and there's 20 pictures of Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:52:25.015 --> 03:52:27.017]  He's the spitting image of Barack Obama.
[03:52:27.037 --> 03:52:28.078]  He looks exactly like him.
[03:52:28.878 --> 03:52:30.699]  And the Kenyan looks nothing like Obama.
[03:52:31.120 --> 03:52:32.701]  So I realized at that moment, I said,
[03:52:33.539 --> 03:52:36.320]  Look, the where's the birth certificate is not the question.
[03:52:36.360 --> 03:52:38.221]  The question is, who's the real father?
[03:52:38.981 --> 03:52:42.862]  If you answer that question, you get in Obama's entire political agenda.
[03:52:43.263 --> 03:52:51.946]  Obama was radicalized by Frank Marshall Davis, a Soviet agent, a Russian spy who attempted to help overthrow the United States government during the Cold War.
[03:52:52.406 --> 03:52:54.287]  This is the guy that raised Barack Obama.
[03:52:54.327 --> 03:52:55.767]  Now you understand the whole agenda.
[03:52:56.187 --> 03:52:57.268]  So that's how I got into it.
[03:52:57.288 --> 03:52:58.808]  It was just by following my interests.
[03:52:58.828 --> 03:53:03.090]  So thanks a lot for asking and be sure to get that film in the Infowars store.
[03:53:03.797 --> 03:53:05.698]  Let's go to John in Arizona.
[03:53:06.259 --> 03:53:08.400]  John in Arizona, you're on Alex Jones Show.
[03:53:11.342 --> 03:53:12.103]  Are you with us, John?
[03:53:14.864 --> 03:53:15.225]  OK.
[03:53:17.846 --> 03:53:18.227]  Are you there?
[03:53:21.689 --> 03:53:22.069]  Yes, sir.
[03:53:22.109 --> 03:53:22.629]  Go ahead, John.
[03:53:25.972 --> 03:53:26.872]  OK, I think we lost him.
[03:53:26.892 --> 03:53:28.093]  We're going to have to move on.
[03:53:28.533 --> 03:53:30.174]  Let's go to Dan in Texas.
[03:53:30.394 --> 03:53:31.535]  Dan in Texas, go ahead.
[03:53:31.575 --> 03:53:32.596]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:53:33.368 --> 03:53:34.029]  Thank you, sir.
[03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:35.390]  I have a question.
[03:53:36.531 --> 03:53:37.011]  We're tough.
[03:53:37.591 --> 03:53:38.873]  We were tough with North Korea.
[03:53:39.633 --> 03:53:50.342]  But we're not really tough on Mexico that the communist president that just got elected is telling everybody he's got both borders open come to America to have a new life.
[03:53:50.702 --> 03:53:53.464]  You know, that could be considered an act of war.
[03:53:54.525 --> 03:53:58.628]  And maybe they build their own fence, if they know that we're not going to deal with it.
[03:53:59.329 --> 03:54:02.892]  If they don't deal with it, maybe we can just go in there and clean that place out.
[03:54:03.757 --> 03:54:09.618]  The drugs and, you know, I would call them missiles coming here full of disease and crap.
[03:54:11.218 --> 03:54:12.319]  I mean, what do you think about that?
[03:54:13.679 --> 03:54:26.081]  Look, the issue with the Mexican border has simply been political will and the lack of enough Republicans or anyone to want to go ahead and secure the border.
[03:54:26.241 --> 03:54:29.141]  There's a number of reasons why Democrats don't want to secure the border.
[03:54:29.722 --> 03:54:30.562]  They need voters.
[03:54:30.642 --> 03:54:31.662]  They can't fool
[03:54:32.771 --> 03:54:35.211]  The regular people can't fool all the people all the time.
[03:54:36.112 --> 03:54:39.592]  A lot of black people are getting more successful.
[03:54:39.632 --> 03:54:40.812]  The economy is helping.
[03:54:40.832 --> 03:54:41.973]  They move out of the inner cities.
[03:54:42.413 --> 03:54:47.874]  They want to replace them with these illegals and with voters from South America.
[03:54:48.314 --> 03:54:49.554]  Democrats have their agenda.
[03:54:49.574 --> 03:54:59.096]  Republicans, the Department of Chamber of Commerce, have liked the immigrants, the illegal immigrants, driving down wages, also detrimental to minorities.
[03:54:59.716 --> 03:55:01.236]  So you've had these strong interests that
[03:55:01.986 --> 03:55:03.746]  Have been pushing against securing the border.
[03:55:03.786 --> 03:55:16.669]  So the political will of the of Donald Trump that ran his campaign on, you know, build that wall and being elected to do so is battling it now, having a battle with the old interests that don't want to secure the border.
[03:55:17.089 --> 03:55:23.150]  So it could be done in, you know, in a few weeks, in a month, in two months, if he can garner the support.
[03:55:23.190 --> 03:55:24.911]  So I think it's going to be up to the midterms.
[03:55:25.171 --> 03:55:30.232]  If Trump and Republicans are very successful in the midterms, I think it's going to happen.
[03:55:30.888 --> 03:55:37.051]  If they're not successful in the midterms, I think we're looking at a screeching halt to much of the Trump agenda that people voted for.
[03:55:37.831 --> 03:55:42.753]  Let's go to Liberty Smith in Oklahoma.
[03:55:42.993 --> 03:55:44.233]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:55:44.934 --> 03:55:45.454]  Hey, Joel.
[03:55:45.794 --> 03:55:46.254]  How are you?
[03:55:47.335 --> 03:55:47.655]  Excellent.
[03:55:47.675 --> 03:55:48.255]  Thanks for being here.
[03:55:49.295 --> 03:55:49.816]  Good.
[03:55:50.336 --> 03:55:55.118]  I just wanted to touch base on the Soros thing that you were talking about a little bit earlier.
[03:55:55.618 --> 03:55:58.139]  And my question is simply,
[03:55:58.985 --> 03:56:02.246]  He's been doing all these things, even in the United States.
[03:56:02.926 --> 03:56:06.567]  Why hasn't anybody picked up on prosecuting him?
[03:56:08.227 --> 03:56:08.667]  That's one question.
[03:56:08.687 --> 03:56:11.488]  Look, the short answer is, yeah, I mean, the short answer is money.
[03:56:11.508 --> 03:56:17.469]  I mean, he gives hundreds of millions to all these leftist organizations, the Tides Foundation.
[03:56:18.389 --> 03:56:26.111]  Every time there's some crazy leftist idea, you start Googling it on the web and you find out it's getting money from some other Soros front group.
[03:56:26.724 --> 03:56:40.354]  So the amount of money that he throws around into the legal system, into foundations, it's just incredible how much money he's able to put in people's pockets to prevent, to control the agenda.
[03:56:40.374 --> 03:56:41.274]  Look at Hillary Clinton.
[03:56:41.755 --> 03:56:42.975]  How many crimes over the years?
[03:56:43.015 --> 03:56:48.079]  She has a rap sheet 10 feet long, but she's connected to that network.
[03:56:50.034 --> 03:56:59.822]  The amount of money coming in through the Soros gang is much more significant than Republicans giving money to some PAC, you know, that they complain about Citizens United.
[03:57:00.503 --> 03:57:06.227]  The big deal is these social justice organizations, and even if one of them gets shut down, they just slither over to another one.
[03:57:06.728 --> 03:57:17.857]  They're very formidable in Washington, in the legal circles, they're formidable in every state, and it's the amount of money he's able to put in, and I think it
[03:57:18.783 --> 03:57:21.524]  It's very interesting to really look at his early history.
[03:57:21.605 --> 03:57:26.307]  How did he get out of Nazi Europe being a Nazi spy?
[03:57:26.867 --> 03:57:28.488]  And why did the Russians let him go?
[03:57:28.528 --> 03:57:30.109]  And how did he become so rich so quickly?
[03:57:30.409 --> 03:57:35.812]  I think the answer is pretty obvious, especially when you look what he's done and whose interests he's been serving for so many years.
[03:57:36.372 --> 03:57:37.273]  Thanks for being here today.
[03:57:37.333 --> 03:57:39.133]  That's the last call on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:39.173 --> 03:57:41.675]  I'm Joel Gilbert from the People's Republic of California.
[03:57:42.255 --> 03:57:43.716]  I'll see you next week or in two weeks.
[03:57:44.696 --> 03:57:46.137]  Everybody, God bless America.
[03:57:46.177 --> 03:57:47.658]  Keep tuning in to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:52.125 --> 03:57:55.807]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[03:57:56.107 --> 03:57:59.528]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[03:57:59.889 --> 03:58:09.413]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[03:58:09.913 --> 03:58:10.314]  Study.
[03:58:10.594 --> 03:58:13.337]  This formula is 24 ppm.
[03:58:13.697 --> 03:58:15.479]  That's 32 ppm version.
[03:58:15.839 --> 03:58:18.662]  Is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[03:58:18.722 --> 03:58:21.085]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[03:58:21.345 --> 03:58:26.030]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[03:58:26.050 --> 03:58:26.651]  Ah, you don't want that.
[03:58:27.031 --> 03:58:27.572]  And VRE.
[03:58:28.232 --> 03:58:30.814]  Two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[03:58:31.034 --> 03:58:33.696]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[03:58:33.956 --> 03:58:37.279]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
