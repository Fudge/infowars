[00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:14.450]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:36.731]  Thursday, October 25th, 2018.
[00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:37.953]  Now, just 12 days out.
[00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:38.394]  And every day.
[00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.680]  But the Democrats see a red tidal wave coming in.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:02.043]  The more cornered and dangerous these criminals are, and the more desperate they are, the more dangerous they are.
[00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:15.146]  Everybody better be watching their six right now and praying to God on your knees for a human awakening and that this great evil
[00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.925]  Finally be defeated.
[00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:25.089]  I've got stacks of your mainline analysts saying that the Democrats win this election.
[00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:32.594]  They are still way behind and becoming a regional party on the verge of collapse.
[00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:36.616]  But if they lose this election, they're done.
[00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:40.559]  And you're going to have the blue blood version of Republicans and the Tea Party populist.
[00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:59.387]  The Democrats have been trying to extinct the Republican Party and wanting to have a new communist wing, a socialist middle, and a kind of fake right-wing purple Democrat version that plays the part of loyal opposition.
[00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:00.728]  But it is an epic moment.
[00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:03.951]  Now, I have talked to FBI agents I know, I've talked to
[00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:19.646]  Ordinance experts from the Army I know, from the Marine Corps I know, people that have worked for the CIA, people that have both disarmed bombs and people that have been experts at assembling bombs.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.303]  I've also talked to a friend of mine who's the former head of a major city bomb squad.
[00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:28.484]  He is in private practice now.
[00:02:28.484 --> 00:02:30.865]  I made a lot of phone calls last night and today.
[00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:40.350]  And they've all said what experts are even on NBC, I couldn't believe it, and even on CNN, and even on Fox Business.
[00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.292]  They're saying these aren't real bombs.
[00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:46.834]  Explosives, you know, inside plastic doesn't do anything.
[00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:47.954]  Shards of glass.
[00:02:47.954 --> 00:02:48.815]  These look like
[00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:54.347]  Exactly what bombs look like in Hollywood movies.
[00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:55.667]  These look like props.
[00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.568]  And notice who's getting them.
[00:02:58.568 --> 00:03:02.369]  Robert De Niro and all these other Democrats and all these other actors.
[00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.150]  Because whoever did this didn't want to actually kill anybody.
[00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.130]  And notice none of the bombs ever detonated.
[00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.190]  None of them ever exploded.
[00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.371]  I could go to the store right now.
[00:03:11.468 --> 00:03:23.931]  And get some road flares, and some black tape, and put an egg timer on it, pull the case off, just have the outside, put an egg timer on it, and wave that around and say, we just got this bomb!
[00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:25.752]  We just got this bomb!
[00:03:25.752 --> 00:03:30.433]  And then, oh wait, oh, another libertarian conservative nationalist got one.
[00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:34.114]  Oh my gosh, it must be the Democrats who sent it.
[00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:37.495]  Let me write a New York op-ed piece how it's Alex Jones and Donald Trump's fault.
[00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:47.130]  And you see the Democrats foaming at the mouth everywhere about killing the President, killing his family, killing talk show hosts, killing Congress.
[00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.112]  Scalise deserved it, editor of major publication.
[00:03:50.112 --> 00:03:53.555]  There's so many examples, we become numb to it.
[00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:58.158]  And then right on time, 14 days out, Soros gets one, because he's the kingpin.
[00:03:58.158 --> 00:03:59.679]  He gets the most sympathy.
[00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.001]  He's first.
[00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:03.822]  He's taking a lot of heat right now.
[00:04:03.822 --> 00:04:08.126]  And then the Clintons, and then Obama, and it's all hierarchical.
[00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:10.699]  Everybody gets the attention.
[00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.019]  It's like getting a medal.
[00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.440]  Oh, they've been in combat.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.802]  Second day of devices targets Dems critics of Trump.
[00:04:17.802 --> 00:04:19.242]  De Niro gets one.
[00:04:19.242 --> 00:04:23.504]  Cuomo calls in the National Guard.
[00:04:23.504 --> 00:04:25.425]  Oh my gosh.
[00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:29.166]  See, he's declaring an emergency ahead of the election.
[00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:32.007]  He's having mid-press conferences.
[00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:38.210]  Woman holds fake news, fake bombs, signs outside Florida debate.
[00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:43.940]  That's right, and everybody's saying it's fake, including law enforcement, but that's almost getting no attention.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.722]  We'll break it all down, play the clips.
[00:04:45.722 --> 00:04:53.811]  They've got the former deputy director of the FBI coming out, saying, the motive is the Democrats, plus the bombs are fake.
[00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:55.713]  The bombs are fake.
[00:04:55.713 --> 00:04:56.794]  The bombs are fake.
[00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:58.056]  They wouldn't blow your fingers off.
[00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:07.762]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:16.778]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:06:16.778 --> 00:06:20.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.441]  Twelve days!
[00:06:22.441 --> 00:06:33.906]  No, it's not the twelve days of Christmas, it's the twelve days to the most important election in world history, a referendum on nationalism versus tyranny and globalism.
[00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:38.068]  And just like... pudding pie,
[00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:57.025]  Just like the sun coming up in the morning, do I need to go back and get the clips six months ago, three months ago, a month ago, a week ago, when I said, you watch, I think two weeks before the election, they're going to begin plunging the stock market.
[00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:57.365]  Why?
[00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:58.545]  Because they follow patterns.
[00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:01.526]  And they do the same thing because it worked in 2008.
[00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:06.267]  They did the exact same thing two weeks before a general election.
[00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:10.210]  The very same interest.
[00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.931]  The private, globalist, European-owned Federal Reserve.
[00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:16.352]  I've got a story linked on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:17.972]  Stock market crash.
[00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:24.014]  The Dow has plunged 2,368 points from the peak of the market.
[00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:27.795]  And when they raised interest rates four times, Trump said, stop it.
[00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:30.456]  You didn't do that much during all of Obama.
[00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:33.257]  And the economy's not sured up yet.
[00:07:33.257 --> 00:07:33.657]  Stop it.
[00:07:36.598 --> 00:07:39.961]  And now they've done it eight times, and he's like, stop it!
[00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:48.267]  And they've signaled they're going to do it five more times in the next six months to a year.
[00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:57.854]  Oh, and the European Central Bank, the ECB that owns much of the Federal Reserve, but that's all secret.
[00:07:57.854 --> 00:07:59.375]  Only the details came out in 1913.
[00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:02.098]  That's the basics we know from 104 years ago.
[00:08:02.098 --> 00:08:06.361]  It's this private multinational consortium
[00:08:08.783 --> 00:08:14.908]  And now the ECB announced they're not going to print any liquidity into the market.
[00:08:14.908 --> 00:08:25.757]  And the Chinese suddenly are announcing they're cutting liquidity into markets to tank the global market because they believe, who will it hurt?
[00:08:25.757 --> 00:08:28.399]  DJT.
[00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.600]  DJT.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.642]  Because you know what DJT is doing?
[00:08:31.642 --> 00:08:36.566]  He's saying, look, you got a 50% tariff on us, we're going to have one on you.
[00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:37.747]  You got zero, we got zero.
[00:08:39.923 --> 00:08:43.024]  You got a 280% tariff on our milk and cheese?
[00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:44.624]  Just billions a year?
[00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:48.465]  We'll put one on your butt.
[00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:57.368]  And the fact that they've been raping us and having their way with us forever is completely out of control.
[00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:06.528]  And they have built this whole world government by sucking us dry.
[00:09:06.528 --> 00:09:11.130]  And so, to complete their system, they've got to kick populists out.
[00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:28.174]  And so, anywhere, the central banks are still in control, but patriots have been elected from places like Greece, to Italy, to the UK, to the United States, to other areas.
[00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:30.615]  They're trying to kill the markets as well.
[00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:32.957]  Now again, these are big bubbles.
[00:09:32.957 --> 00:09:33.717]  They're out of control.
[00:09:33.717 --> 00:09:39.822]  But see, Trump is letting us ride a bubble that's actually building industry and jobs and confidence.
[00:09:39.822 --> 00:09:41.663]  We were going to have the bubble regardless.
[00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:43.424]  We're not getting out of this now.
[00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:53.611]  The only way to do it is to create such a big economy and have new boom technologies and suppressed medicine and suppressed technological systems and suppressed weapon technologies.
[00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:57.373]  One area I think Trump's getting a little dangerous, but he's lobbying behind the scenes to
[00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:02.635]  Start showing folks the real weapons we've got that'll start a huge arms race.
[00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.117]  And I don't think that's the smart way to get the economy going.
[00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:09.500]  Trump's a little wild when it comes to that, but he's probably smarter than I am.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.805]  You know, he only ran for office once and became President of the United States, has already changed the world in less than two years.
[00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:23.572]  But these powerful forces are striking back in a big, big, big way.
[00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:24.572]  That's how I could predict
[00:10:25.506 --> 00:10:29.249]  That they were going to start doing false flags against themselves two weeks out.
[00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:30.010]  I'm on record.
[00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.491]  Played the Clipshare today.
[00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:35.674]  I said two weeks out is when I think they'll pull it.
[00:10:35.674 --> 00:10:36.375]  It'll start there.
[00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:38.376]  It'll get really crazy.
[00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:41.679]  And I said two weeks out, they'll start plunging the stock market.
[00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:46.223]  Because I've seen what they do.
[00:10:46.223 --> 00:10:47.784]  I know how they operate.
[00:10:47.784 --> 00:10:52.348]  The very same players bombed Oklahoma City and were caught red-handed.
[00:10:54.761 --> 00:10:56.823]  So that's how we know all of this.
[00:10:56.823 --> 00:11:02.889]  Oh, and they're so upset, ladies and gentlemen, that we're tomorrow's news today.
[00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:16.901]  You see, they do pre-programming at almost a subliminal level in TV and in fiction and in non-fiction and in print and on so-called news to get you ready for what's coming.
[00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:18.523]  Well, I can see the programming.
[00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:20.044]  Anybody could, if you're conscious.
[00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:21.988]  That's the whole secret to this.
[00:11:21.988 --> 00:11:27.534]  Have a memory, be conscious, read some history books, and it'll be like, this is ridiculous!
[00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:30.017]  Why did everybody else see this?
[00:11:30.017 --> 00:11:37.445]  Because people are thinking about their job, their kids, what they do, they're specialized at whatever their particular job is.
[00:11:37.445 --> 00:11:38.887]  We're all specialists.
[00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:40.849]  Well, my specialty is not being a specialist.
[00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:58.353]  And studying how globalist and different governments operate, and they've all got different fingerprints, they've got different signatures, the way the left operates, the way classical liberals operate, versus the way conservatives operate, versus the way all these different permutations operate.
[00:11:58.353 --> 00:12:02.636]  And so, let me give you the big news in my view.
[00:12:02.636 --> 00:12:08.239]  They are launching major attacks to shut this economy down, and they think we're stupid and that we'll blame Trump.
[00:12:08.239 --> 00:12:10.100]  I think, if they plunge the economy,
[00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:17.061]  And are able to do that, like Bill Maher and others said they wanted to do, it's going to blow up even worse in their face.
[00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:21.242]  And I think it's going to really fundamentally piss people off to another level.
[00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:22.962]  They're not going to get away with this.
[00:12:22.962 --> 00:12:25.063]  Even though it looks like they're going to go ahead and try to pull it.
[00:12:25.063 --> 00:12:26.843]  In fact, they are pulling it.
[00:12:26.843 --> 00:12:30.584]  It's bad.
[00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:40.727]  This false flag was done, though, and this is the good news, where I kept saying, how are they going to attack the media when the media is in on it and kill their own people and have it believable?
[00:12:43.058 --> 00:13:03.191]  And so they just went with a total hoax of 10 plastic fake bombs off a Hollywood set and instantly all these former top FBI agents, deputy heads, heads of counter-terrorism, you name it, are all coming out saying this isn't a real bomb.
[00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:10.016]  The way it got mailed, who it targets, look at the motive, look at how they're pre-programming and saying that we're going to attack the media when conservatives aren't.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.203]  Look at how they're really the ones pushing all the violence in the left.
[00:13:16.203 --> 00:13:28.169]  And so the good news is, if you go on any mainline newspaper's comment section, 80% of it is, this is a false flag, this is fake, this is ridiculous, this is incredible.
[00:13:28.169 --> 00:13:31.111]  And the way the corporate media, the establishment media jumped on it,
[00:13:32.614 --> 00:13:43.500]  And just absolutely drills it in that it's real, and it's the end of the world, and let's call out the National Guard, and we're all dead when no one's died.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:49.783]  They were trial ballooning this to make them all the victims.
[00:13:49.783 --> 00:13:57.327]  Two weeks out, and if we bought it hook, line, and sinker, they were going to stage some really big, real attacks.
[00:13:57.327 --> 00:14:01.629]  And they might even pawn sacrifice and take a few of their own people out who didn't know it was going to happen.
[00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:16.076]  So we're not out of the woods yet, but right now everything they're doing is turning to absolute crap.
[00:14:16.076 --> 00:14:19.600]  And they're the ones calling for violence everywhere, and then trying to say we are.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.582]  And then they're blaming me.
[00:14:21.582 --> 00:14:26.246]  They're saying my rhetoric is to blame in hundreds of publications.
[00:14:26.246 --> 00:14:35.055]  You type in Alex Jones bomb, Alex Jones pipe bomb, into Bing, into DuckDuckGo, into Google, and I mean it's hundreds of stories blaming me.
[00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:39.825]  And then saying, oh, and how dare he say the Democrats might be behind it?
[00:14:39.825 --> 00:14:43.553]  How dare he say that bears don't bathroom in the woods?
[00:14:43.553 --> 00:14:46.539]  How dare he say Trump has
[00:14:49.164 --> 00:14:50.504]  Orange hair.
[00:14:50.504 --> 00:14:52.345]  I mean, I'm saying real things.
[00:14:52.345 --> 00:14:53.405]  Everybody knows it.
[00:14:53.405 --> 00:14:54.565]  Common sense default.
[00:14:54.565 --> 00:14:55.505]  Two weeks out.
[00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:56.626]  The bombs aren't real.
[00:14:56.626 --> 00:14:57.786]  They're all pity partying.
[00:14:57.786 --> 00:15:02.967]  They're all lined up to go and exploit it and yell and scream and freak out and blame everybody and call it the end of the First Amendment.
[00:15:02.967 --> 00:15:14.990]  And Alexander Soros, who's been caught running Antifa nationwide, trying to cause martial law in the documents, talks about how we're full of hate and how we're going to cause all of this hate and all of this death.
[00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.250]  It is ridiculous.
[00:15:18.331 --> 00:15:23.294]  No one is buying this.
[00:15:23.294 --> 00:15:24.455]  No one would have a brain.
[00:15:24.455 --> 00:15:31.520]  Only the politicos in the NPR and the CNN and the New York Times bubble chamber.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.102]  They're in their little echo chamber, believing their crap.
[00:15:34.102 --> 00:15:35.402]  No one's buying it.
[00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:36.423]  You plunged the economy.
[00:15:36.423 --> 00:15:37.504]  We know you did it.
[00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:39.145]  You're openly bragging you did it.
[00:15:39.145 --> 00:15:40.946]  The Federal Reserve did it.
[00:15:40.946 --> 00:15:41.887]  Foreign Bank, of course.
[00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:45.854]  You staged a big event!
[00:15:45.854 --> 00:15:46.915]  We know it's you!
[00:15:46.915 --> 00:15:47.837]  We know it's you!
[00:15:47.837 --> 00:15:52.284]  You're murdering, lying, scumbag criminals with a long history of it!
[00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:53.445]  So, you're done!
[00:15:53.445 --> 00:15:54.547]  America's awake!
[00:15:54.547 --> 00:15:55.649]  It's over!
[00:15:55.649 --> 00:15:56.550]  It's over for you!
[00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.491]  We'll be back!
[00:15:59.409 --> 00:16:04.192]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.

[00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:05.338]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:08.359]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:14.280]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.081]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:19.341]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:20.681]  Who do we fight for?

[00:20:03.334 --> 00:20:12.136]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:12.136 --> 00:20:18.917]  From Azeroth he came with ragtag bands to bring a revolution
[00:20:40.803 --> 00:20:42.865]  We are back broadcasting worldwide.
[00:20:42.865 --> 00:20:44.467]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:20:45.967 --> 00:21:11.400]  We're about to get into the huge news where former deputy directors of the FBI, former heads of bomb squads, are all coming out saying these bombs didn't detonate, they were meant to scare people, they're not real bombs, they look like fake soft movie sets, you don't build a pipe bomb with BBC, you don't put stickers on them with a political message, because obviously if it's a real bomb it's meant to blow up, you don't want to leave clues, this is insane.
[00:21:12.674 --> 00:21:20.759]  Former FBI assistant director, bomb plot culprit, could be someone who's trying to get the Democrat vote out and incur sympathy.
[00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:21.539]  Exactly.
[00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:29.704]  And make all these demonized figures, who deserve to be demonized, look like the victims.
[00:21:29.704 --> 00:21:36.348]  And then we've got law enforcement official, examiners think mail bomb could have been hoax devices.
[00:21:36.348 --> 00:21:42.132]  What did we say yesterday with Matt Bracken, who's a former ordnance specialist, Navy SEAL, best-selling author?
[00:21:43.655 --> 00:21:46.796]  Those aren't real bombs.
[00:21:46.796 --> 00:21:51.058]  They don't even have caps on the end.
[00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:54.919]  It appears there's not even gunpowder in them, they're saying.
[00:21:54.919 --> 00:22:05.482]  It's a bunch of shards of glass inside a tube that even if you had explosive in it, it would just shove it out the ends with a bunch of smoke, might burn your hand.
[00:22:05.482 --> 00:22:10.764]  But we're not even sure that they had any powder in them.
[00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:12.945]  They're now basically saying they didn't.
[00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:16.848]  Hoax devices!
[00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:36.115]  Now, they've censored myself and thousands of other prominent nationalists, Christians, and conservatives, and just common sense folks ahead of the midterms, so they could have air superiority on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, you name it, so that they could put out all these incredible lies and have us just believe it.
[00:22:36.115 --> 00:22:38.295]  But they can't stop DrudgeReport.com.
[00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:40.456]  They can't stop InfoWars.com.
[00:22:40.456 --> 00:22:41.937]  And most importantly, they can't stop you.
[00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:49.316]  Going to the sites and getting the articles that they don't want you to see and getting them out.
[00:22:49.316 --> 00:22:51.098]  Like DrudgeReport.com has done.
[00:22:51.098 --> 00:22:54.201]  So what happens to DrudgeReport.com?
[00:22:54.201 --> 00:23:05.192]  I said two weeks ago on air that I would expect DrudgeReport.com, I remember saying it, to be the next target because they already think that they've demonized me enough.
[00:23:07.426 --> 00:23:09.548]  And guess who they blame?
[00:23:09.548 --> 00:23:15.873]  MSNBC suggests mail bomb suspect reads Drudge Report and Fox News.
[00:23:15.873 --> 00:23:17.294]  Ben Collins.
[00:23:17.294 --> 00:23:20.937]  So I thought I'd search engine it this morning and see where else he was being blamed.
[00:23:20.937 --> 00:23:26.141]  So many hits, I didn't even try to look at it.
[00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:27.141]  Then I forgot about it.
[00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:28.022]  That was at 6 a.m.
[00:23:28.022 --> 00:23:31.505]  I get into the office and I see three articles blaming Matt Drudge.
[00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:42.634]  Oh, well yeah, it's the number one news site in the world, the second largest site in the world, period.
[00:23:42.634 --> 00:23:47.297]  It's like saying, yeah, he drove by and saw the Capitol, so it's the Capitol's fault.
[00:23:47.297 --> 00:23:50.939]  They're getting it ready for this patsy.
[00:23:50.939 --> 00:23:52.500]  I'm telling you, they're gearing it up.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.221]  Now the M.O.
[00:23:53.221 --> 00:23:58.745]  from Matt Brackett and others has proven frighteningly accurate, Matt has, and the other sources I have that are off record.
[00:24:01.368 --> 00:24:16.274]  Says that it looks like cat lady brigade level, bottom of the barrel, even for Antifa, thinking they've got to save Hillary and all these people, and that they may have even, with some higher level direction, been tricked into acting alone.
[00:24:16.274 --> 00:24:25.057]  And then now we've got to watch out they may kill the ringleader of it, because there's probably at least five people involved, and then plant pro-Trump paraphernalia at the site.
[00:24:25.057 --> 00:24:29.279]  So whoever did this, you better give a press conference and go public.
[00:24:30.367 --> 00:24:31.427]  They're probably already all dead.
[00:24:31.427 --> 00:24:38.811]  I mean, if you look at the different angles of this, if they use low-level patches, which this looks like, they're probably already dead.
[00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:40.672]  And then they're gonna have it lead back with clues.
[00:24:42.776 --> 00:24:46.117]  To some mentally ill person that they'll plant Trump paraphernalia on.
[00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:48.177]  I mean, that's how the M.O.
[00:24:48.177 --> 00:24:48.818]  usually works.
[00:24:48.818 --> 00:24:58.200]  That's one of the major permutations we run into over the years when they run something like this and they're using idiots to carry it out so that they can have plausible deniability.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:05.542]  But the timing and everything shows high-level direction, but they wanted to keep their hands clean, so they used a bunch of bumbling ding-dongs.
[00:25:11.007 --> 00:25:16.249]  So, that's what it looks like to us.
[00:25:16.249 --> 00:25:18.010]  Yeah, here's another CNN.
[00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.331]  Former bomb disposal officer on CNN.
[00:25:20.331 --> 00:25:24.833]  Bomb thing that is just silly looking, goes on to say it isn't a real bomb.
[00:25:24.833 --> 00:25:27.274]  I mean, there's so many of these, my head's spinning.
[00:25:27.274 --> 00:25:30.455]  Lou Dobbs comes out, says it's a fake bomb.
[00:25:30.455 --> 00:25:34.897]  Law enforcement comes out, says it's a fake bomb.
[00:25:34.897 --> 00:25:36.978]  We're gonna go through all the people saying that.
[00:25:38.206 --> 00:25:43.268]  And the specifics, and play the videos when we come back from break.
[00:25:43.268 --> 00:25:48.051]  But know this, their Pocahontas DNA thing blew up in their face.
[00:25:48.051 --> 00:26:01.117]  Their totally fake, in my view, impeached women who perjured themselves, according to all the witnesses, in front of Congress, trying to shoot down Kavanaugh.
[00:26:01.117 --> 00:26:03.218]  This has all been blowing up in their face.
[00:26:03.218 --> 00:26:06.980]  Because people know they're a pack of lying villains running this.
[00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.031]  And so now I just ask, what are they going to do next?
[00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:18.693]  Because these globalists are so out of their minds that they thought Hillary Clinton could win.
[00:26:18.693 --> 00:26:29.137]  And I told you months ago, and again two weeks ago, I've talked to high-level sources that, let's just say, watch Hillary very, very closely.
[00:26:29.137 --> 00:26:35.238]  I mean, we're talking high-level CIA, high-level folks.
[00:26:35.238 --> 00:26:36.939]  And Hillary is running.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.482]  And is telling the Democrats, I control the party, and I control the superdelegates, get out of the way.
[00:26:43.482 --> 00:26:55.768]  And that's why you saw them come out in Salon, and in Vanity Fair, and in Atlantic Monthly, and in Politico, and say, we hate you, you're horrible, go away.
[00:26:55.768 --> 00:27:00.591]  About a week after I told you that, three weeks ago, you noticed they all came out and said, stop it, go away.
[00:27:00.591 --> 00:27:06.514]  And then you saw this week, she says she's not going away, and she's gonna run.
[00:27:06.514 --> 00:27:08.235]  That's how crazy she is.
[00:27:10.552 --> 00:27:24.982]  So it's good that she's an idiot, and that Pelosi's an idiot, and Maxine Waters is a senile idiot, but it's also dangerous because these people are crazy and think they're invincible.
[00:27:24.982 --> 00:27:28.184]  So, they're all saying, we hate you, just go away.
[00:27:28.184 --> 00:27:29.725]  Just type in Hillary Clinton, just go away.
[00:27:29.725 --> 00:27:32.067]  Click News.
[00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:33.248]  Hillary Clinton, you're killing us.
[00:27:33.248 --> 00:27:34.549]  She won't go away.
[00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:36.210]  She's an egomaniac, psychotic.
[00:27:37.725 --> 00:27:41.328]  Whose illusions of grandeur came true over and over again.
[00:27:41.328 --> 00:27:46.011]  She's already been co-president in two administrations over four terms.
[00:27:46.011 --> 00:27:49.174]  That's how many years?
[00:27:49.174 --> 00:27:51.676]  That's a long time, baby.
[00:27:51.676 --> 00:27:54.978]  That's 16 years she's been president.
[00:27:54.978 --> 00:27:58.821]  Dear God, Hillary Clinton, please just go!
[00:27:58.821 --> 00:27:59.902]  You can go by truck.
[00:27:59.902 --> 00:28:00.902]  You can go by ship.
[00:28:00.902 --> 00:28:01.903]  You can go by train.
[00:28:01.903 --> 00:28:03.004]  You can go by plane.
[00:28:03.004 --> 00:28:04.245]  You can go by helicopter.
[00:28:04.245 --> 00:28:04.905]  You can go by...
[00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.090]  Crunk car!
[00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.471]  Just go, go, go!
[00:28:08.471 --> 00:28:09.931]  Whatever you do, go, go, go!
[00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:12.291]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:15.892]  But you won't go, go, go!
[00:28:15.892 --> 00:28:20.793]  I wish the Democrats would reform themselves and stop being the We Hate America Party.
[00:28:20.793 --> 00:28:22.754]  But that's who they are.
[00:28:22.754 --> 00:28:24.554]  Alright, start your engines.
[00:28:24.554 --> 00:28:25.215]  There's Politico.
[00:28:25.215 --> 00:28:26.955]  How do we solve a problem like Hillary?
[00:28:28.078 --> 00:28:30.380]  She's a perfect God for you people.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.261]  You're an evil American hating party.
[00:28:32.261 --> 00:28:34.663]  They are the party that hates America.
[00:28:34.663 --> 00:28:36.304]  They're the invader party.
[00:28:36.304 --> 00:28:39.126]  They're the globalist party.
[00:28:39.126 --> 00:28:40.907]  They kill the party.
[00:28:40.907 --> 00:28:41.487]  They're gone.
[00:28:41.487 --> 00:28:42.028]  They're over.
[00:28:42.028 --> 00:28:43.328]  Or we are.
[00:28:43.328 --> 00:28:48.732]  They go on TV on every channel and say, to say nationalists is the most evil thing in the universe.
[00:28:48.732 --> 00:28:53.736]  They're totally disconnected in their own psychotic university and CNN bubbles.
[00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:55.277]  We'll be back with the critical intel.

[00:28:59.364 --> 00:29:03.208]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.

[00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:05.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.953 --> 00:33:26.060]  Thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.144]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.448 --> 00:33:46.990]  But of course, they're going to be looking at this as a potential terrorist motive, whether it's on one side or the other.
[00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:59.092]  And as you correctly pointed out earlier, this doesn't necessarily mean that someone is espousing some sort of conservative ideology and targeting Democrats.
[00:33:59.092 --> 00:34:03.293]  It could be someone who's trying to get the Democratic vote out and incur sympathy.
[00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:04.673]  So it could go either way.
[00:34:04.673 --> 00:34:07.294]  That's an interesting point.
[00:34:08.536 --> 00:34:12.457]  Assistant Director.
[00:34:12.457 --> 00:34:17.378]  On-plot culprit could be someone who's trying to get the Democratic vote out and incur sympathy.
[00:34:17.378 --> 00:34:24.379]  They're going to be looking at this as a potential terrorist motive.
[00:34:24.379 --> 00:34:27.600]  And then, now, the image becomes clearer and clearer.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.901]  It is a way to frame conservatives, nationalists, Trump, libertarians.
[00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:31.561]  Yours truly.
[00:34:32.543 --> 00:34:34.044]  Particularly.
[00:34:34.044 --> 00:34:37.987]  Now I have another clip I want to get to here from NBC News.
[00:34:37.987 --> 00:34:40.668]  We've also got a CNN News saying the same thing.
[00:34:40.668 --> 00:34:54.898]  Because you can get the regular pundits to sit up there and lie, but professionals who are bomb squad experts, who are FBI agents that have been trained in this, they're not going to get up there and in front of all their colleagues sound like a liar or an idiot.
[00:34:55.572 --> 00:34:57.893]  So they're going to tell you, these aren't real bombs.
[00:34:57.893 --> 00:34:58.933]  None of them went off.
[00:34:58.933 --> 00:35:00.274]  They were meant to scare people.
[00:35:00.274 --> 00:35:04.775]  They had stickers on them that were political messages of who they wanted to frame.
[00:35:04.775 --> 00:35:07.677]  That's what all the MO points at.
[00:35:07.677 --> 00:35:13.839]  Then you have the timing, you have the motive, and you have the people that got mailed the bombs.
[00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:20.601]  George Soros and his son's compound, one of many.
[00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:23.843]  Bill and Hillary Clinton's compound.
[00:35:23.843 --> 00:35:24.563]  Barack Obama.
[00:35:25.754 --> 00:35:26.754]  Eric Holder?
[00:35:26.754 --> 00:35:40.117]  I mean, these people have all been involved in overthrowing governments, and staging events, and lying, and saying that Hillary was shot at, an airplane was shot at on the ground, and they had to run into the bunkers, and none of it was true, and she admits it's a lie.
[00:35:40.117 --> 00:35:46.559]  They're like Brian Williams, but a hundred times worse.
[00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:52.840]  These people will do anything, and so they have the motive, they have the timing, the things are clearly fake, they're inert,
[00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:05.298]  The Hill's reporting woman holds fake news, fake bombs, sign out Florida, governor's debate.
[00:36:05.298 --> 00:36:14.649]  Again, the public gets it and that's the power of you showing up at a governor's debate and holding up a sign because everyone resonates with it and people get it.
[00:36:16.872 --> 00:36:20.355]  You're more important than I am because there's more of you.
[00:36:20.355 --> 00:36:31.303]  Matt Drudge always says any blogger who breaks a real story on a little website or a huge website is just as important as the New York Times if you're out there on the ground telling the truth.
[00:36:31.303 --> 00:36:37.728]  You're just as important, but you're more important because there's more of you than there are of Alex Jones and Matt Drudge.
[00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:39.750]  So go to the Democrat rallies.
[00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:40.971]  Hold up signs.
[00:36:40.971 --> 00:36:44.733]  And if they get violent with you, take one for the team.
[00:36:44.733 --> 00:36:45.734]  Show their violence.
[00:36:45.734 --> 00:36:46.275]  Put it out.
[00:36:46.835 --> 00:36:47.916]  They're the violent ones.
[00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:48.376]  We're not.
[00:36:48.376 --> 00:36:49.637]  They're trying to frame us.
[00:36:49.637 --> 00:37:03.067]  The fact that they're violent, they've got illegal alien caravans, UN, Soros funded slamming into us, and the fact that the polls show, even internal polls, that they're going way down, and this could be a huge red wave despite all their election fraud.
[00:37:03.067 --> 00:37:07.089]  They don't know what to do!
[00:37:07.089 --> 00:37:08.891]  Let's go to the NBC piece.
[00:37:08.891 --> 00:37:09.231]  Here it is.
[00:37:12.466 --> 00:37:19.916]  So by our count, nine so far, including two sent to Maxine Waters, one that was found in L.A., one in the Washington, D.C.
[00:37:19.916 --> 00:37:22.359]  center that scans mail for Congress.
[00:37:22.359 --> 00:37:27.326]  And we're told by several officials that, fortunately, the devices they've been able to examine so far
[00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:28.786]  They are working at it around the clock.
[00:37:53.533 --> 00:37:57.918]  Now Pete, the hunt is on right now to find whoever the person or persons are who sent this.
[00:37:57.918 --> 00:38:00.440]  So what are investigators doing?
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.984]  So first of all, you have the bombs themselves analyzed at the FBI lab.
[00:38:03.984 --> 00:38:09.690]  They're looking for traces of evidence, DNA, fibers, hair, anything that would identify who did this.
[00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:13.334]  And they're also looking to trace where the components made from.
[00:38:13.334 --> 00:38:16.357]  At least four of these packages, the ones sent to the Clinton
[00:38:16.397 --> 00:38:18.178]  Well, except these weren't sent in the mail.
[00:38:18.178 --> 00:38:19.019]  They were hand-delivered.
[00:38:45.506 --> 00:38:51.992]  Now I've got a whole article at Infowars.com and Newswars.com that it's critical everybody send out from Newswars.com.
[00:38:51.992 --> 00:38:55.655]  That gets around the censors better than the dreaded Infowars.com.
[00:38:55.655 --> 00:39:04.383]  Law enforcement official examiners think mail bombs could have been hoax devices made to look like bombs seen in movies or TV but not meant to explode.
[00:39:04.383 --> 00:39:10.709]  And then it's got other experts on CNN and all over having to admit it.
[00:39:11.684 --> 00:39:30.909]  So this is clearly with the motive and the background and the timing about making people that are part of the establishment and anti-Trump look like victims so they can say criticism of them is causing violence, which was the pre-programming of all the corporate establishment globalist media for months and months blaming Trump and myself.
[00:39:30.909 --> 00:39:32.550]  And sure enough, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:39:34.778 --> 00:39:38.260]  I have a stack of news here blaming Trump and yours truly.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.582]  When we come back, we'll go over it and play some more of the clips.
[00:39:41.582 --> 00:39:49.406]  Lou Dobbs has also come out and said that the suspicious packages are fake.
[00:39:49.406 --> 00:39:52.188]  And then he's talked to experts that tell him they're clearly fake.
[00:39:52.188 --> 00:39:54.849]  And that's exactly what Matt Bracken and other experts have told us.
[00:39:54.849 --> 00:39:56.630]  But these stories on NewsWars.com
[00:39:58.385 --> 00:39:58.445]  And
[00:40:13.373 --> 00:40:18.035]  And they kept saying, the crazy Republicans say it's a false flag, but they're behind it.
[00:40:18.035 --> 00:40:18.955]  Trump's behind it.
[00:40:18.955 --> 00:40:20.276]  He's the one calling for violence.
[00:40:20.276 --> 00:40:23.297]  No, you're the ones calling for violence.
[00:40:23.297 --> 00:40:29.900]  We have new articles out today in the New York Times, writing op-eds, fantasizing about Trump's assassination.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.601]  Today!
[00:40:31.601 --> 00:40:38.124]  It's every day, everywhere, where if you try to categorize all the examples of them calling for violence, it makes your head spin.
[00:40:39.571 --> 00:40:45.775]  Then they lie about me and say that I say go kill the media with battle rifles.
[00:40:45.775 --> 00:40:47.616]  Cue up that Lester Holt for later, I want to play that.
[00:40:47.616 --> 00:40:50.558]  I didn't use the Lester Holt, just the one clip he pulled in.
[00:40:50.558 --> 00:40:51.879]  It was just all over the news.
[00:40:51.879 --> 00:40:52.680]  Every channel.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.201]  Jones says kill the media.
[00:40:54.201 --> 00:40:57.403]  And Ryan Stelter would shake his head and Cuomo would shake his head.
[00:40:57.403 --> 00:40:59.064]  Why is this man allowed on air?
[00:40:59.064 --> 00:41:00.285]  And no one's asking.
[00:41:00.285 --> 00:41:03.187]  They just said Alex Jones says kill them!
[00:41:03.187 --> 00:41:04.647]  Show the video!
[00:41:04.647 --> 00:41:06.649]  Show it you lying garbage!
[00:41:06.649 --> 00:41:07.689]  You criminal!
[00:41:07.689 --> 00:41:08.130]  God!
[00:41:09.906 --> 00:41:16.830]  Excuse me, I just... You know, if I tell you somebody said something, I play the clip, don't I?
[00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.231]  Or I show the article.
[00:41:18.231 --> 00:41:20.473]  They don't do that!
[00:41:20.473 --> 00:41:23.475]  I've offered a $1 million reward if you can find it.
[00:41:23.475 --> 00:41:26.597]  They can't.
[00:41:26.597 --> 00:41:27.457]  What does that tell you?
[00:41:27.457 --> 00:41:29.719]  These people are suspect of everything.
[00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:32.881]  They are the scum of the earth.
[00:41:32.881 --> 00:41:34.122]  And they think you're morons.
[00:41:34.122 --> 00:41:35.362]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:41:35.362 --> 00:41:36.103]  I haven't even plugged.
[00:41:39.338 --> 00:41:44.201]  Once an hour on average now, because I'm so focused on the news, and then, you know, a few weeks out.
[00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:46.443]  We need your financial support, plus we make it easy.
[00:41:46.443 --> 00:41:56.609]  You want the very best affordable food, we got a best sale ever, 35% off of my patron supply, super high quality, good to have that backup in case they kill the Trump recovery and things go south, which could happen.
[00:41:56.609 --> 00:42:02.673]  I hate to be, you know, negative, but I'm certainly stocked up and up at my security and emergency supplies, quite frankly.
[00:42:02.673 --> 00:42:05.435]  Plan, you know, for the worst, hope for the best.
[00:42:05.435 --> 00:42:07.897]  We've got all the high quality
[00:42:09.104 --> 00:42:09.184]  Yeah.

[00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.112]  Alpha Power, strongest male-female enhancement.

[00:42:35.093 --> 00:42:36.313]  It's all 50% off.
[00:42:36.313 --> 00:42:38.074]  DNA Force Plus, incredible.
[00:42:38.074 --> 00:42:41.716]  PQQ, CoQ10, super strong formula.
[00:42:41.716 --> 00:42:42.176]  50% off.

[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.843]  Get your Christmas shopping in now.
[00:42:51.843 --> 00:42:54.908]  Be smart and secure the info war into the future.
[00:42:54.908 --> 00:42:56.370]  Without you, we're done.
[00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:57.592]  We are in your hands.
[00:42:57.592 --> 00:42:59.435]  I am in your hands.
[00:42:59.435 --> 00:43:03.341]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:13.345]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:43:13.345 --> 00:43:15.326]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:18.787]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:43:18.787 --> 00:43:21.408]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:43:21.408 --> 00:43:23.709]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:43:23.709 --> 00:43:30.652]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:40.997]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:43:40.997 --> 00:43:42.177]  We'll win.
[00:43:42.177 --> 00:43:44.498]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:43:44.498 --> 00:43:52.222]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:43:52.222 --> 00:43:55.924]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[00:43:55.924 --> 00:43:57.484]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.
[00:43:57.484 --> 00:43:58.345]  We need your support.
[00:43:58.345 --> 00:43:58.885]  I'm counting on you.
[00:43:59.285 --> 00:44:04.326]  Please, tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your community, constantly, this is a censored show.
[00:44:04.326 --> 00:44:05.486]  They want to shut it down.
[00:44:05.486 --> 00:44:07.086]  Don't let them do it.
[00:44:07.086 --> 00:44:09.187]  InfoWars.com.
[00:44:09.187 --> 00:44:10.427]  We're in your hands.
[00:44:10.427 --> 00:44:24.329]  If you don't spread the word about InfoWars, if you don't spread the word about NewsWars.com, if you don't get the great Patriot t-shirts with all the beautiful designs, if you don't get the water filtration and air filtration that's the best out there, very low prices, if you don't get the great supplements, we won't be here.
[00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:25.030]  It's up to you.
[00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.530]  And you've been responding, you've been supporting, so I want to thank you.
[00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.952]  You're also getting really great products like X2, the last run of it.
[00:44:30.952 --> 00:44:32.072]  Secret 12, amazing.
[00:44:32.072 --> 00:44:33.673]  Vitamin B12, the highest quality.
[00:44:33.673 --> 00:44:35.654]  Brain Force Plus, now at 20% more.
[00:44:35.654 --> 00:44:40.317]  It's all 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping.
[00:44:40.317 --> 00:44:48.261]  But it's got to end by this weekend because so many of the great products are running low, like Knockout, the great sleep aid, like Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[00:44:48.261 --> 00:44:49.622]  Nobody can get it at that price.
[00:44:49.622 --> 00:44:51.563]  But you are the folks that have stood with us
[00:44:51.843 --> 00:44:55.347]  So it's a 360 Win-Win at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:55.347 --> 00:44:55.968]  Please take action.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:06.624]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[00:45:06.624 --> 00:45:13.449]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[00:45:13.449 --> 00:45:29.000]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[00:45:30.143 --> 00:45:33.966]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[00:45:33.966 --> 00:45:39.209]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[00:45:39.209 --> 00:45:40.510]  And here's the best part.
[00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.351]  It is absolutely free.
[00:45:42.351 --> 00:45:47.555]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[00:45:47.555 --> 00:45:51.517]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:45:51.517 --> 00:45:53.379]  It's the InfoWars official app.
[00:45:53.379 --> 00:45:55.640]  Taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.763]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:46:00.223 --> 00:46:05.528]  They now know that InfoWars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[00:46:05.528 --> 00:46:07.630]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:13.735]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[00:46:13.735 --> 00:46:14.636]  Come to their door.
[00:46:14.636 --> 00:46:15.196]  I'm death.
[00:46:15.436 --> 00:46:15.677]  I'm dead.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:33.600]  We're good to go.
[00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:12.058]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:12.058 --> 00:47:14.639]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:17.341]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:28.203 --> 00:47:31.264]  The midterms are rapidly approaching, bearing down on us.
[00:47:31.264 --> 00:47:33.844]  A lot of Democrats are on edge.
[00:47:33.844 --> 00:47:47.648]  Especially today, because a serial bomber has sent explosive devices to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, major Democratic donor George Soros, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Maxine Waters, and CNN.
[00:47:47.648 --> 00:47:55.870]  Authorities don't have a suspect yet, but based on the intended targets, they have released this sketch.
[00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:56.950]  Make America Great Again.
[00:47:59.204 --> 00:48:09.547]  So we specifically predicted that when they launch their false flags, be they duds or be they real, that they would blame CNN because that's been who Trump's been mainly focused on.
[00:48:09.547 --> 00:48:17.509]  It's all out of central casting and now former deputy director of the FBI has come out and said they're the prime suspect, the left staging this against themselves to get sympathy.
[00:48:18.564 --> 00:48:21.666]  Like Trump said, remember his first emergency State of the Union?
[00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:23.607]  It wasn't even a regular State of the Union.
[00:48:23.607 --> 00:48:24.808]  He'd been in office two weeks.
[00:48:24.808 --> 00:48:28.950]  He came out and said, I'm not anti-Semitic and I condemn the attacks on Jewish centers.
[00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:33.072]  Because he'd said weeks before, well, I'm told by sources it's probably staged.
[00:48:33.072 --> 00:48:34.733]  Well, they knew who the suspect was.
[00:48:34.733 --> 00:48:38.295]  They busted him a week after the speech.
[00:48:38.295 --> 00:48:47.481]  The young leftist Jewish guy was running around, pushing over gravestones, defacing Jewish centers.
[00:48:48.806 --> 00:48:51.788]  To make Trump look anti-semitic, which is just asinine.
[00:48:51.788 --> 00:48:53.628]  It's insane.
[00:48:53.628 --> 00:48:56.050]  The left calls me anti-semitic.
[00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.831]  I am anti-leftist Jew.
[00:48:58.831 --> 00:49:00.332]  I'm anti-leftist Chinese.
[00:49:00.332 --> 00:49:02.213]  I'm anti-leftist English.
[00:49:02.213 --> 00:49:04.674]  I'm anti-leftist Mexican.
[00:49:04.674 --> 00:49:07.816]  I am really sick of leftists, yes, but I'm not against Jews.
[00:49:08.663 --> 00:49:11.905]  Jews are diverse people, just like every other group.
[00:49:11.905 --> 00:49:14.908]  There's some Chinese I don't like, there's some Chinese I love.
[00:49:14.908 --> 00:49:18.190]  There are some Texans, you know, black-white, that I love.
[00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:19.892]  There are some I don't love.
[00:49:19.892 --> 00:49:29.919]  And I can tell you, I don't like Soros who helped round up fellow Jews, and the fact that he doesn't believe Israel should exist and wants to destroy Israel.
[00:49:29.919 --> 00:49:33.942]  And for that, I'm called anti-Semitic.
[00:49:33.942 --> 00:49:34.703]  But let me digress.
[00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:39.380]  I kind of went down a rabbit trail there.
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:47.542]  We have MSNBC saying that the mail bomb suspect reads Drudge Report and Fox Finish.
[00:49:47.542 --> 00:49:50.563]  Just like after Oklahoma City they blamed talk radio.
[00:49:50.563 --> 00:49:53.284]  This is all out of central casting just like we predicted.
[00:49:55.216 --> 00:49:59.238]  Because they keep saying, we're going to be attacked and it's Trump and Alex Jones' fault.
[00:49:59.238 --> 00:50:06.102]  Hollywood blames bombs on Trump, make America great again, radicalized, more domestic terrorists than ISIS.
[00:50:06.102 --> 00:50:10.384]  This from the Weather Underground inspired Hollywood.
[00:50:10.384 --> 00:50:14.726]  Right-wing pundits are already spinning Clinton-Obama bomb hoax conspiracy.
[00:50:14.726 --> 00:50:17.908]  Chief amongst them, Alex Jones.
[00:50:17.908 --> 00:50:18.428]  The Observer.
[00:50:19.594 --> 00:50:22.916]  Alex Jones has taken over the Republican Party.
[00:50:22.916 --> 00:50:26.999]  The Alex Jones-ization of the right is now complete.
[00:50:26.999 --> 00:50:29.100]  Patheos finally gets it right.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.982]  Yes, people are reality-based now.
[00:50:30.982 --> 00:50:34.484]  I go to a Trump rally, 90% are rabid fans, and I'm fans of them.
[00:50:34.484 --> 00:50:37.786]  Yes, yes, we already beat you culturally.
[00:50:37.786 --> 00:50:39.307]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:50:39.307 --> 00:50:42.129]  The circle is now complete.
[00:50:42.129 --> 00:50:44.571]  But I intend to go on fighting you.
[00:50:44.571 --> 00:50:48.013]  But it is good to know that we've got a lot of hurdles to cross, but
[00:50:49.491 --> 00:50:57.963]  Awakening the Giant, that part of the mission, I've already completed that mission thanks to God's graces and the listeners and viewers that built the platform for us to do it.
[00:50:57.963 --> 00:50:59.805]  You did it, listeners.
[00:50:59.805 --> 00:51:00.807]  You are in the arena.
[00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:14.193]  Just like a woman working in a factory putting together bombs or sewing together uniforms is helping the men win the war back in World War II or Vietnam or whatever the case was.
[00:51:14.193 --> 00:51:19.435]  You supporting me, whether you be a man or a woman, is absolute tip of the spear.
[00:51:19.435 --> 00:51:25.437]  Fox News channels Alex Jones, calls bombs false flag.
[00:51:25.437 --> 00:51:27.537]  Oh, I haven't gotten to that video clip.
[00:51:27.537 --> 00:51:28.198]  Let's grab that one.
[00:51:28.198 --> 00:51:28.998]  There's so many I forget.
[00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:37.768]  Right-wing commentators have already decided that the explosive packages are a false flag.
[00:51:37.768 --> 00:51:41.370]  Trump allies insist bomb threats against Clinton, Obama, CNN are pure BS.
[00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:42.410]  False flag.
[00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.031]  There's literally hundreds of these articles.
[00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:48.193]  Trump lovers are already claiming explosive devices sent to Obama, Clinton, CNN are false flags.
[00:51:48.193 --> 00:51:52.855]  Well, you're already blaming us, and you have the motive, and the history.
[00:51:52.855 --> 00:51:57.557]  Alex Jones, bombs-liberty Democrats are a false flag, trillion percent.
[00:51:57.557 --> 00:52:00.839]  And it goes on, and on, and on.
[00:52:02.267 --> 00:52:05.430]  And then I've got the articles where they blame me.
[00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:20.423]  I've got a whole stack of those, we'll get to later, where they blame me and say my rhetoric, from Mother Jones to MSNBC to CNN, I've got a whole stack of those, saying it's my fault!
[00:52:20.423 --> 00:52:23.546]  It's my fault!
[00:52:23.546 --> 00:52:26.769]  It's my fault all this is happening!
[00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:28.631]  After all, Jim Carrey said so!
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.962]  How experts trace a homemade bomb to its source.
[00:52:32.962 --> 00:52:41.506]  And the first line is, people have caused hatred towards George Soros, Holocaust survivor, hero.
[00:52:41.506 --> 00:52:45.208]  And then you've got the Nazi Alex Jones, who talked bad about him and President Trump.
[00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:49.570]  First line of the article, it's Alex Jones and Donald Trump.
[00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:51.351]  It's all our fault.
[00:52:51.351 --> 00:52:53.712]  Right there, you see that?
[00:52:53.712 --> 00:52:56.554]  But here they are a few months ago, getting you all ready, lying about me.
[00:52:57.907 --> 00:52:59.450]  Saying that I was calling for violence.
[00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.732]  Getting the ground leg.
[00:53:00.732 --> 00:53:02.755]  You can see the whole PR campaign.
[00:53:02.755 --> 00:53:03.075]  Here it is.
[00:53:04.727 --> 00:53:11.552]  Twitter's CEO is standing by the company's decision to put InfoWars' Alex Jones on a seven-day suspension.
[00:53:11.552 --> 00:53:20.378]  This comes after Jones urged his Twitter followers to ready their battle rifles, as he put it, against the media in a video posted to the site.
[00:53:20.378 --> 00:53:29.124]  Alex Jones on Twitter posted this week what essentially is a video calling for people to get their battle rifles ready against the media.
[00:53:29.124 --> 00:53:32.046]  People need to have their battle rifles and everything ready, their bedsides.
[00:53:33.067 --> 00:53:34.087]  You gotta be ready.
[00:53:34.087 --> 00:53:36.848]  Saying it's time to act, it's gotta be done now.
[00:53:36.848 --> 00:53:38.989]  Move criminally against people.
[00:53:38.989 --> 00:53:47.532]  It's time politically, and economically, and judiciously, and legally, and criminally, to move against these people.
[00:53:47.532 --> 00:53:49.992]  It's got to be done now.
[00:53:49.992 --> 00:53:51.233]  Send a chill up my spine.
[00:53:51.233 --> 00:53:51.713]  How about yours?
[00:53:52.657 --> 00:54:03.062]  It did, I mean there's a number of actions that we believe help a call to incitement to violence and those are the things that we need to...
[00:54:09.525 --> 00:54:13.229]  You need to be ready, because they're sending Antifa to our houses to kill us.
[00:54:13.229 --> 00:54:14.430]  That's been in the news.
[00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.934]  If you are in law enforcement, you've been doxxed, or Congress, you should be ready.
[00:54:17.934 --> 00:54:20.156]  But they turned that into, I'm inciting violence.
[00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:22.078]  No, you are, Jack Dorsey!
[00:54:22.078 --> 00:54:22.419]  Continue.
[00:54:23.581 --> 00:54:24.382]  Taking action on it.
[00:54:24.382 --> 00:54:29.325]  Now is the time to act on the mainstream media and he says get the battle rifles ready.
[00:54:29.325 --> 00:54:30.646]  I didn't say that!
[00:54:30.646 --> 00:54:32.368]  That incites violence.
[00:54:32.368 --> 00:54:35.290]  Free speech does not protect inciting violence.
[00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:40.534]  This is an emergency message to President Trump, to Congress, and to anyone that supports free speech in this country.
[00:54:40.934 --> 00:54:49.436]  The Democratic Party is now calling for all Republicans, all patriots, including the President, to be de-platformed from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, you name it.
[00:54:49.436 --> 00:54:51.696]  And Jones is hardly their only target, that's for sure.
[00:54:51.696 --> 00:54:57.257]  Virtually every day, the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[00:54:57.257 --> 00:54:59.558]  Facebook censored our free speech.
[00:54:59.558 --> 00:55:04.379]  And shame on the ones that don't even see that we have been censored.
[00:55:04.379 --> 00:55:10.060]  This is a new super political class that operate as a judiciary.
[00:55:11.212 --> 00:55:15.993]  And as the police, and as the prison guards, to control our lives.
[00:55:15.993 --> 00:55:17.674]  This is classical authoritarianism.
[00:55:17.674 --> 00:55:23.175]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[00:55:23.175 --> 00:55:26.536]  You've taken action against him in this instance, William.
[00:55:26.536 --> 00:55:27.736]  Can you tell us what it is?
[00:55:27.736 --> 00:55:29.877]  I believe we put him in a time out.
[00:55:29.957 --> 00:55:33.619]  Alex Jones is not an 8th grader who got busted smoking in the bathroom.
[00:55:33.619 --> 00:55:33.859]  Right.
[00:55:33.859 --> 00:55:34.840]  Like, it's just not.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:40.723]  I mean, he's a guy who is, you know... Or someone who is... ...pulling alt-right conspiracies and theories and... It's actually amazing... That's alt-right fiction.
[00:55:40.723 --> 00:55:45.385]  ...that this is what caused the ban and not everything that Alex Jones has done before.
[00:55:45.385 --> 00:55:52.629]  Seems minor compared to the implications of someone suggesting a call to arms against a particular group, in this case, the media.
[00:55:52.629 --> 00:55:54.250]  I didn't say use weapons on the media.
[00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.731]  I don't want them to have weapons used on them.
[00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:56.792]  That'll make them victims.
[00:55:56.792 --> 00:55:59.433]  I'm worried they're going to false flag and stage something on themselves.
[00:55:59.433 --> 00:56:03.816]  And then they're going to send antifa out to all our houses, which they're doxing everybody, saying they are.
[00:56:03.816 --> 00:56:06.437]  And I said, defensively, be prepared to defend yourself.
[00:56:06.437 --> 00:56:08.758]  And they say that is inciting violence.
[00:56:08.758 --> 00:56:09.199]  No, it's not.
[00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:10.800]  You said to chill up my spine.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.200]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.642]  He said, come with the battle rifles, engage in criminal activity.
[00:56:15.642 --> 00:56:20.025]  And I said, use the judicial system legally and lawfully and go after them criminally.
[00:56:20.025 --> 00:56:21.726]  They have got to get a lid on this.
[00:56:21.926 --> 00:56:26.807]  And the idea of martyrdom, it's also probably interesting, but it will be interesting to see who rallies around his cause.
[00:56:26.807 --> 00:56:28.988]  Let's remember, Donald Trump has appeared on your show.
[00:56:28.988 --> 00:56:31.148]  The president also entering the fray today.
[00:56:31.148 --> 00:56:40.911]  He said, quote, I won't mention names, but when they take certain people off of Twitter or Facebook and they're making that decision, that is really a dangerous thing because it could be you tomorrow.
[00:56:40.911 --> 00:56:42.291]  And we're also standing up
[00:56:43.388 --> 00:56:46.130]  To social media censorship.
[00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:47.251]  That's the new thing.
[00:56:47.251 --> 00:56:52.835]  Trump's election and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status quo.
[00:56:52.835 --> 00:56:54.376]  People know what's true.
[00:56:54.376 --> 00:56:55.617]  They can smell it.
[00:56:55.617 --> 00:56:57.218]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[00:56:57.218 --> 00:56:59.339]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.821]  This is about freedom.
[00:57:01.821 --> 00:57:05.022]  Mr. President, you don't want to look like you're after the press of the First Amendment.
[00:57:05.022 --> 00:57:07.522]  You're letting them butcher the press of the First Amendment.
[00:57:07.522 --> 00:57:11.144]  Oh, but you don't want to look authoritarian and stand up to them.
[00:57:11.144 --> 00:57:12.384]  They're authoritarian.
[00:57:12.384 --> 00:57:13.945]  They're in clear and present danger.
[00:57:13.945 --> 00:57:14.965]  Do something about it!
[00:57:18.452 --> 00:57:20.393]  That was my message to Trump interspersed.
[00:57:20.393 --> 00:57:23.115]  We've got to play that message that freaked him out so bad.
[00:57:23.115 --> 00:57:28.219]  It was like 35 minutes and I just laid out all the proof, their statements, their plans, and I said, do something!
[00:57:28.219 --> 00:57:34.103]  And they know the president listens, especially when you magnify the message and get it to him, because you are the resistance.
[00:57:34.103 --> 00:57:38.486]  Don't forget, free shipping storewide and 50% off on all the supplements.
[00:57:38.486 --> 00:57:41.788]  It ends this Sunday because the special's got to end.

[00:57:42.949 --> 00:57:44.770]  The big special is about to end.

[00:58:54.722 --> 00:58:58.205]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[00:58:58.205 --> 00:58:59.966]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[00:58:59.966 --> 00:59:03.249]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[00:59:03.249 --> 00:59:10.015]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[00:59:10.015 --> 00:59:15.099]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[00:59:15.439 --> 00:59:21.541]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:59:21.541 --> 00:59:24.522]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:59:24.522 --> 00:59:25.622]  I want to keep going.
[00:59:25.622 --> 00:59:29.443]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:59:29.443 --> 00:59:31.464]  I want to push all the way.
[00:59:31.464 --> 00:59:32.764]  I've committed to do that.
[00:59:32.764 --> 00:59:33.825]  I've prayed for that.
[00:59:33.825 --> 00:59:35.485]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:59:35.485 --> 00:59:37.906]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:59:38.406 --> 00:59:39.546]  I will never falter.
[00:59:39.546 --> 00:59:42.067]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:59:42.067 --> 00:59:43.007]  I physically will.
[00:59:43.007 --> 00:59:53.791]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and fullwarestore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[00:59:53.791 --> 00:59:56.412]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.326 --> 01:00:14.139]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:00:14.139 --> 01:00:15.503]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:25.294 --> 01:00:36.321]  All right, Matt Bracken is a smart dude, former Navy SEAL, munitions expert, best-selling author, and what he said yesterday on the show was the first person to start saying that these bombs look fake.
[01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:37.162]  None of them went off.
[01:00:37.162 --> 01:00:39.643]  It looks like it is a total hoax.
[01:00:39.643 --> 01:00:50.971]  Well, now you've got the former Deputy Director of the FBI, Assistant Deputy Director, you've got all these other bomb experts, even on CNN, MSNBC, NBC, saying this all looks fake.
[01:00:52.045 --> 01:00:55.347]  So next segment, he's going to be joining us.
[01:00:55.347 --> 01:00:57.609]  There's Matt Bracken right there getting ready.
[01:00:57.609 --> 01:01:03.873]  And we're going to go through this and then get his take on what's next, because I agree with him.
[01:01:03.873 --> 01:01:08.917]  Especially in hindsight now, 48 hours into this fiasco starting, no one
[01:01:10.231 --> 01:01:11.472]  I know believes this.
[01:01:11.472 --> 01:01:20.715]  I had liberal women come up to me in an art supply place with my daughters last night and say, hey, we used to be big liberals and we still are socially, but you're right.
[01:01:20.715 --> 01:01:22.636]  This is so fake.
[01:01:22.636 --> 01:01:26.557]  You know, we saw them setting you up, saying you were going to cause violence and now it's happening.
[01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:28.758]  I mean, it's the pre-programming.
[01:01:28.758 --> 01:01:29.939]  Trump's going to kill us.
[01:01:29.939 --> 01:01:32.199]  Alex is going to kill us.
[01:01:32.199 --> 01:01:38.502]  And then they all get mailed these plastic bombs that don't even have caps on them, that they're not even saying there's explosive in it.
[01:01:39.491 --> 01:01:42.353]  And it's just ridiculous.
[01:01:42.353 --> 01:01:43.654]  And it's all these politicos.
[01:01:43.654 --> 01:01:49.519]  But don't worry, it's also how they're blaming Matt Drudge on MSNBC.
[01:01:49.519 --> 01:01:53.882]  See, because they've been hitting me really hard, they're going to move on now to their real targets.
[01:01:53.882 --> 01:01:55.103]  Sure, I'm big.
[01:01:55.103 --> 01:01:59.726]  And we're effective because the audience is patriots and you can get messages to the president, you can punch through.
[01:01:59.726 --> 01:02:02.108]  But they really don't like Matt Drudge.
[01:02:02.108 --> 01:02:02.228]  OK?
[01:02:02.228 --> 01:02:07.792]  Can you imagine having the number two biggest website in the world, the largest news site in the world?
[01:02:08.686 --> 01:02:14.748]  And even though places like the New York Times admit half their traffic's from drugs, they still hate him.
[01:02:14.748 --> 01:02:21.011]  And they lobby all over the news to have him shut down, saying, he links to stories, that's a campaign donation.
[01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.700]  Well, I almost agree with him.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.602]  If I was Drudge, I know he's being fair, I wouldn't be linking.
[01:02:27.602 --> 01:02:28.842]  I'm not telling Drudge what to do.
[01:02:28.842 --> 01:02:34.245]  But, you know, you've got the Washington Post, the New York Times, all these places that are attacking Drudge.
[01:02:34.245 --> 01:02:39.929]  And I've made the point, that's really high road when he links to them, even though they're trying to destroy him.
[01:02:39.929 --> 01:02:40.989]  But whatever.
[01:02:40.989 --> 01:02:41.930]  The point is, is that
[01:02:45.677 --> 01:02:50.483]  They're now moving on to their other targets, Trump and Drudge.
[01:02:50.483 --> 01:02:51.325]  Trump and Drudge.
[01:02:51.325 --> 01:02:53.207]  Because you couldn't have Trump without Drudge.
[01:02:54.605 --> 01:03:01.671]  And everything they see as underpinning Trump is being hacked away, hacked away, hacked away.
[01:03:01.671 --> 01:03:12.139]  And really the big news I'm going to cover in the third hour after Matt Bracken leaves us is the stock market plunging and how they admit, the Democrats admit they wanted to plunge it.
[01:03:12.139 --> 01:03:17.383]  And the Federal Reserve that's private and foreign-owned, 80% of it, is trying to raise interest rates to do it.
[01:03:17.383 --> 01:03:18.824]  And now it's working!
[01:03:18.824 --> 01:03:21.126]  And the left's like, how dare you say we shouldn't?
[01:03:21.946 --> 01:03:22.847]  Raise interest rates.
[01:03:22.847 --> 01:03:23.348]  Shut up!
[01:03:23.348 --> 01:03:24.590]  We'll show you!
[01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:26.813]  This economy's not going to be long-lived.
[01:03:26.813 --> 01:03:29.516]  You know, that's a powerful compilation we ought to put together, not just a...
[01:03:31.331 --> 01:03:43.754]  Not just of Bill Maher saying we need to have a depression to punish Trump and punish his supporters, because as long as the good times are rolling and they see anti-globalist policies, you can bring back some jobs to America, some oxygen back to the room.
[01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:49.976]  We've got to get all the clips of the last two years, because things started getting better right when he got elected.
[01:03:49.976 --> 01:03:54.217]  You can see the graphs, where just boom, confidence is going down like this, and then suddenly it's like boom, boom, goes up.
[01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:58.335]  And they're trying to put the brakes on that right now.
[01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:19.221]  And it's so powerful, all the clips that I've seen, we played them here and there, but you'll have an economic person on there like, well, the economy's up, that's Obama's, or, well, it's up a little bit in the first quarter, but it'll go back down, and then about a year later, well, he's only had one quarter of growth, and the expert goes, well, actually, it's been at four quarters of growth.
[01:04:19.221 --> 01:04:25.263]  You can just see them cheerleading and cheerleading and cheerleading and now getting excited, oh, well, this hurting?
[01:04:26.889 --> 01:04:33.575]  And the Chinese stopped dumping stimulus into their stock market, which theirs is way down more than ours, which drug us down some.
[01:04:33.575 --> 01:04:38.198]  And the European Central Bank, privately owned, it's cut that as well.
[01:04:38.198 --> 01:04:42.722]  So they're doing everything to try to put the dampers on this.
[01:04:42.722 --> 01:04:45.444]  And to me, that's a huge scandal.
[01:04:45.444 --> 01:04:54.772]  Yeah, the whole thing's a bubble anyways, but when they're trying to pop the bubble to hurt us and to make us think Trump did it, that's called economic terrorism, isn't it?
[01:04:58.425 --> 01:05:01.506]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[01:05:01.506 --> 01:05:04.468]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:07.389]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:05:07.389 --> 01:05:11.951]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top
[01:05:13.024 --> 01:05:22.148]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:22.148 --> 01:05:27.511]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[01:05:34.774 --> 01:05:38.756]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:05:38.756 --> 01:05:40.977]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:40.977 --> 01:05:42.058]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:05:42.518 --> 01:05:44.521]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.521 --> 01:05:47.084]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:47.084 --> 01:05:52.049]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:57.436]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:15.779]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.779 --> 01:06:24.029]  When some police guy says, you know, they appeared viable, the mainstream media runs that as, they were viable bombs.
[01:06:24.733 --> 01:06:31.200]  Well, yeah, they appeared on the outside like it could be, but as soon as you peel them apart, they're a joke.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.464]  So just as you said, they're now admitting they're basically dummy bombs.
[01:06:35.464 --> 01:06:40.569]  And so this fits into the narrative that all these top Democrats get mailed this to change the narrative.
[01:06:40.569 --> 01:06:47.677]  The Democrats now, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:48.846 --> 01:06:57.088]  Have openly come out and blamed Trump for the hoax pipe bombs and they have come out and blamed me and I already covered those articles earlier.
[01:06:57.088 --> 01:06:59.609]  Alright, that's from a clip last night.
[01:06:59.609 --> 01:07:09.711]  There's also clips up on InfoWars.com in the second hour of the show when former Navy SEAL, ordinance expert, best-selling author Matt Bracken of EnemiesForeignDomestic.com joined us.
[01:07:09.711 --> 01:07:12.412]  But now we have the former FBI assistant director
[01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:14.653]  Bomb plot culprit.
[01:07:14.653 --> 01:07:19.834]  Evidence points towards being someone who's trying to get the Democratic vote out and incur sympathy.
[01:07:19.834 --> 01:07:20.634]  That's the M.O.
[01:07:20.634 --> 01:07:21.975]  That's the history.
[01:07:21.975 --> 01:07:24.135]  The bombs appear to be fake.
[01:07:24.135 --> 01:07:29.097]  That CNN, MSNBC, every bomb expert they have on says they appear to be fake.
[01:07:29.097 --> 01:07:31.258]  They appear to be just to create fear.
[01:07:31.258 --> 01:07:32.258]  So it's a bomb scare.
[01:07:33.737 --> 01:07:34.517]  It's a bomb scare.
[01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.898]  Most bomb attacks are bomb scares.
[01:07:36.898 --> 01:07:45.620]  Someone mails in a fake bomb, or they act like they're assembling a bomb to get attention, and then get kicked out of school, and then, you know, sue people about it.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.280]  So this is what goes on over and over again.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:52.661]  But now we've got Lou Dobbs talking about it, and we've got law enforcement officials, examiners.
[01:07:52.661 --> 01:07:54.822]  I think mail bombs were hoax devices.
[01:07:54.822 --> 01:07:57.722]  Well, Matt Bracken said that yesterday.
[01:07:57.722 --> 01:07:59.963]  But meanwhile, if you question that,
[01:08:00.883 --> 01:08:05.027]  MSNBC, CNN, NPR say you're the worst person on earth.
[01:08:05.027 --> 01:08:05.608]  My God.
[01:08:05.608 --> 01:08:10.553]  You know, even though none of these 10 devices blew up, which we're glad they didn't.
[01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:13.256]  But it's like throwing fake poop down at somebody at a party.
[01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:15.057]  It's like a gag.
[01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:16.098]  But don't worry, though.
[01:08:16.098 --> 01:08:23.346]  They're blaming us out of the gates and saying my rhetoric against Soros in Newsweek and Mother Jones and everywhere, it's my fault.
[01:08:24.974 --> 01:08:29.716]  But simultaneously, I need to just take the blame, and so does Matt Drudge, and so does the President.
[01:08:29.716 --> 01:08:32.638]  The President says, it's the media calling for my assassination.
[01:08:32.638 --> 01:08:37.800]  It's the media calling for violence.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.202]  So, this is a mess, and I agree with Bracken that the wheels are coming off.
[01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:46.424]  Everything they're doing is falling apart, because here's the deal.
[01:08:46.424 --> 01:08:47.945]  They're not in control anymore.
[01:08:47.945 --> 01:08:51.867]  They're not able to stage an Oklahoma City, and then control the event.
[01:08:52.819 --> 01:09:00.880]  They're somewhat out of power now, and as Trump is able to get more control over the Justice Department, less and less can they run a sophisticated operation.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.741]  So, this has really blown up in their face, but they're going ahead with it.
[01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:08.982]  Matt Bracken, you predicted so much of what's already unfolded.
[01:09:08.982 --> 01:09:15.043]  What are the latest observations, and what do you expect for them to pull next?
[01:09:15.043 --> 01:09:20.824]  One thing to keep in mind is the FBI, the task force, so it's FBI, ATF, Secret Service,
[01:09:21.696 --> 01:09:21.977]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:38.627 --> 01:09:46.889]  So that the guy would probably have to plead guilty to not get a life sentence, as opposed to going through court and him saying, it wasn't me, it was my brother.
[01:09:46.889 --> 01:09:51.030]  You know, he could already be under surveillance.
[01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:57.032]  You think that's why the former police commissioner of New York said that he thinks they'll be busted within two days?
[01:09:58.976 --> 01:10:09.941]  Yeah, Busted or they already know who it is within two days, but they may want to watch him to see who he's contacting, to see who he's calling, to see if anybody visits him before they make an arrest.
[01:10:09.941 --> 01:10:13.823]  So we might not know for a couple days after they know who it is.
[01:10:13.823 --> 01:10:19.426]  But the thing about this that it's obviously a pseudo bomb or a hoax bomb.
[01:10:19.426 --> 01:10:21.967]  You can tell because it's come out today.
[01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.028]  They were just plastic.
[01:10:23.588 --> 01:10:26.231]  And a plastic pipe bomb is a joke.
[01:10:26.231 --> 01:10:39.826]  A pipe bomb works because it contains the pressure of a low-power, not even explosive, but a combustible material like gunpowder, which is not truly an explosive unless it's contained.
[01:10:40.438 --> 01:10:52.105]  Putting it inside of a steel pipe means that it causes the gas expands and eventually the pressure causes the steel to rupture in an explosive fashion.
[01:10:52.105 --> 01:10:57.028]  But doing it inside of a cardboard tube obviously wouldn't work the same way, or a PVC tube.
[01:10:57.659 --> 01:10:58.079]  P.V.C.
[01:11:13.755 --> 01:11:18.960]  The purpose of a mail bomb is to have it open when it's, have it detonate when it's opened.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.023]  So typically they're going to like have a string tied inside of a box.
[01:11:23.023 --> 01:11:26.046]  In the old days they would have the string around the box.
[01:11:26.046 --> 01:11:26.987]  Sure, you can have a mousetrap.
[01:11:26.987 --> 01:11:28.869]  You can have something like a mousetrap.
[01:11:30.242 --> 01:11:39.771]  Right, so the initiator would be a physical initiator that works not on a timer, you know, where it's just going to go off in a mail truck and blow up a bunch of letters.
[01:11:39.771 --> 01:11:42.634]  It's going to work when somebody opens the package.
[01:11:42.634 --> 01:11:44.475]  This is the opposite of that.
[01:11:44.475 --> 01:11:47.238]  All of these packages were made to look exactly the same.
[01:11:47.658 --> 01:11:53.362]  So, once one of them was found, all of them would be found and segregated out.
[01:11:53.362 --> 01:11:57.004]  If this was a real bomber, each package would look different.
[01:11:57.004 --> 01:11:58.445]  They'd have small print.
[01:11:58.445 --> 01:12:03.328]  They wouldn't have, you know, the large computer-generated font that you can see across the room.
[01:12:03.328 --> 01:12:05.829]  You know, these were all made to be identified.
[01:12:05.829 --> 01:12:10.212]  You know, it's clearly a hoax meant to support the Democrats.
[01:12:10.212 --> 01:12:14.215]  They're calling it the MAGA bomber on liberal media.
[01:12:15.255 --> 01:12:25.618]  On CNN this morning, I saw the banner across the bottom said, National Manhunt for Serial Bomber.
[01:12:25.618 --> 01:12:31.719]  Well, this is obviously BS, because to be a bomber, something has to explode.
[01:12:31.719 --> 01:12:38.941]  You know, they're hunting for a serial fake bomber or hoax bomber, but they're still playing this as a bomber.
[01:12:39.681 --> 01:12:42.383]  On, on liberal, on, in liberal media.
[01:13:01.221 --> 01:13:07.524]  I asked, what are they going to do if they want violence against themselves, but they know they're in on it, are they going to stage some synthetic thing?
[01:13:07.524 --> 01:13:08.665]  I asked you that.
[01:13:08.665 --> 01:13:16.129]  And you said, well, I think they'll just get crazy and shoot into a stadium, you know, arcing it in or out of a hotel again, or, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:16.129 --> 01:13:21.352]  But now we see, I mean, now we see that it's literally
[01:13:23.389 --> 01:13:40.392]  Like a gag at a party or something, but instead it's a mean-spirited bomb, and it's all these different targets of the Liberty Movement who we are politically exposing, and now this makes them get the grandstand and say, see, First Amendment causes violence, but it turns out the whole thing's a hoax.
[01:13:40.392 --> 01:13:44.233]  Fake bombs, it's not a bomber, they're calling it a bomber.
[01:13:44.233 --> 01:13:45.593]  So what does that M.O.
[01:13:45.593 --> 01:13:48.454]  mean to you about suspects and about what they're going to pull next?
[01:13:50.157 --> 01:13:55.443]  Yeah, it's somebody that doesn't have the guts or the wherewithal or even own a gun.
[01:13:55.443 --> 01:13:58.947]  So it's somebody that went and they bought enough of the same materials.
[01:13:58.947 --> 01:14:07.998]  I don't know if all the bombs look like the one that we already saw, but they're going to be able to say, you know, who bought that type of PVC?
[01:14:07.998 --> 01:14:10.201]  Who bought those digital clocks?
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:17.004]  It's unlikely that somebody in their house would have nine old digital clocks that they could hook up.
[01:14:17.004 --> 01:14:23.249]  So if somebody went out and bought, you know, off of eBay, nine digital clocks, the FBI already knows who they are.
[01:14:23.249 --> 01:14:27.672]  And the same thing with the PVC, although that's a little bit more generic.
[01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:28.913]  I'm not sure what's on the end.
[01:14:28.913 --> 01:14:30.154]  I thought for a while that was galvanizing.
[01:14:30.154 --> 01:14:35.218]  But the big thing is, this was not mailed to the mail, and so they're going to be able to find out who delivered this.
[01:14:35.218 --> 01:14:37.880]  So whoever did this was reckless and a complete moron.
[01:14:39.204 --> 01:14:55.451]  Right, and somebody, a pro-Antifa guy, some Bill Ayers type, might have urged one of the real morons to do this and either convince them that they wouldn't be caught, or to take one for the team, you'll be famous.
[01:14:55.451 --> 01:15:02.014]  It's hard to figure out until they catch the guy, but I agree with Candace Owens.
[01:15:02.014 --> 01:15:06.176]  99% this is a leftist doing a false flag against the conservatives.
[01:15:06.873 --> 01:15:07.813]  And I agree with that.
[01:15:07.813 --> 01:15:14.295]  And Antifa is so stupid and so degenerate and allowed to call for violence all over Twitter by Jack Dorsey, who probably is an Antifa member.
[01:15:14.295 --> 01:15:18.577]  He probably is out there on the crap-filled streets of San Francisco himself in skinny jeans.
[01:15:18.577 --> 01:15:20.517]  He looks like a meth head, so he probably is.
[01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:21.978]  But he protects Antifa.
[01:15:22.578 --> 01:15:28.883]  When will they get smart enough to have someone take one for the team, hate to give them ideas, and actually say they're a right-wing Trump supporter?
[01:15:28.883 --> 01:15:32.385]  That's next-level pawn sacrifice, if they figure it out.
[01:15:32.385 --> 01:15:40.391]  And the question is, are they preparing to roll out the person that knew they would be caught in pawn sacrifice to blame myself, Trump, and others?
[01:15:40.391 --> 01:15:43.093]  We'll be right back to talk about the next level of this.
[01:15:44.014 --> 01:15:51.162]  With Matt Bracken and what he thinks the Democrats might pull next straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[01:15:51.162 --> 01:15:53.345]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:15:53.345 --> 01:15:54.907]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:15:57.771 --> 01:15:58.972]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.972 --> 01:16:04.354]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.354 --> 01:16:07.255]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.255 --> 01:16:10.837]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.837 --> 01:16:18.400]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.002]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:16:23.002 --> 01:16:25.423]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:16:25.423 --> 01:16:26.584]  Faketv.com
[01:16:27.426 --> 01:16:28.326]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:16:28.326 --> 01:16:30.728]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:16:30.728 --> 01:16:38.872]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:16:38.872 --> 01:16:40.813]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:44.515]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:16:44.515 --> 01:16:49.237]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:53.679]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:16:53.679 --> 01:16:54.320]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:16:57.481 --> 01:17:02.264]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:17:02.264 --> 01:17:08.148]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:17:08.148 --> 01:17:14.653]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:17:14.653 --> 01:17:18.695]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[01:17:18.695 --> 01:17:24.959]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.

[01:17:27.541 --> 01:17:28.782]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.782 --> 01:17:32.683]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.683 --> 01:17:34.224]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:34.224 --> 01:17:37.185]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:42.747]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.747 --> 01:17:43.947]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.947 --> 01:17:46.888]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.888 --> 01:17:49.109]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:49.109 --> 01:17:53.551]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:17:53.551 --> 01:17:55.892]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:58.015 --> 01:18:03.339]  They now know that InfoWars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[01:18:03.339 --> 01:18:05.421]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:11.525]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, and to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[01:18:11.525 --> 01:18:12.446]  Come to their door.
[01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:13.947]  I'm death, and they know it.
[01:18:13.947 --> 01:18:15.068]  I'm death of their system.
[01:18:15.188 --> 01:18:30.662]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast we'll be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products and we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history and it has got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products and we are hurting
[01:18:30.742 --> 01:18:31.222]  I think so.
[01:18:58.266 --> 01:19:02.211]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:05.496]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:19:05.496 --> 01:19:11.784]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.784 --> 01:19:14.547]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:19:15.288 --> 01:19:19.093]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:19:19.093 --> 01:19:25.580]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:30.546]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:35.203]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:42.407]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:42.407 --> 01:19:47.631]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:53.314]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:53.314 --> 01:19:57.297]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:01.302 --> 01:20:03.915]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:16.958]  Welcome back!
[01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:22.420]  This is the most censored, the most demonized, the most lied about broadcast in the world for a good reason.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:23.680]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.462]  We have the guests on that are experts who've been proven right over and over again.
[01:20:27.462 --> 01:20:28.882]  Our job is easy.
[01:20:28.882 --> 01:20:33.944]  Just do research, tell the truth, be honest, but be fearless.
[01:20:33.944 --> 01:20:38.425]  And that's why Infowars is on over 250 radio stations, over 350 TV stations, over 100 cable stations and growing.
[01:20:42.918 --> 01:20:46.781]  So yes, they blocked us on social media, and that hurts our outreach.
[01:20:46.781 --> 01:20:52.626]  But you, with your email and with word of mouth, have taken it over the top.
[01:20:52.626 --> 01:21:07.497]  And I'm not bragging, it's very buoying, though, to go to the Trump rally in Houston, and 90% of people came up yelling and screaming and hugging me, of every race, color, and creed, and thanking me.
[01:21:07.497 --> 01:21:08.298]  I was thanking them.
[01:21:08.298 --> 01:21:09.319]  These are my brothers and sisters.
[01:21:11.082 --> 01:21:24.372]  And I wasn't doing it to virtue signal, but when families of black folks were coming over, and I just couldn't help when they wanted to hug me, hugging them and everything, because it was so good to break the will of a globalist and how they want to turn us against each other.
[01:21:24.372 --> 01:21:26.574]  So, very exciting things.
[01:21:26.574 --> 01:21:32.398]  Now, we're having some positive stuff go on, but I want to ask Matt again.
[01:21:32.398 --> 01:21:34.100]  Everything the globalists are doing is falling apart.
[01:21:36.715 --> 01:21:37.836]  But they're not going to give up.
[01:21:37.836 --> 01:21:40.077]  That's the one thing is the tenacity of Hillary and others.
[01:21:40.077 --> 01:21:41.378]  She's planning to still run.
[01:21:41.378 --> 01:21:42.279]  I told you that first.
[01:21:42.279 --> 01:21:43.019]  It's now confirmed.
[01:21:43.019 --> 01:21:44.220]  I mean, she's crazy.
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:46.502]  That may change, but currently she's planning.
[01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:49.484]  They're telling Democrats just don't even try.
[01:21:49.484 --> 01:21:52.145]  I'm going to get it.
[01:21:52.145 --> 01:21:57.669]  So with all these bad things happening to them, what are they planning to do next?
[01:21:57.669 --> 01:22:00.931]  Well, I think it's plunge the stock market, plunge U.S.
[01:22:00.931 --> 01:22:04.934]  Treasuries, which China and the EU are openly trying to do with the Federal Reserve.
[01:22:04.934 --> 01:22:05.815]  What does the President do?
[01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:14.634]  I think it's time for him to go after the private run for private Federal Reserve and use his real power through Congress to put pressure on them to stop the interest rate hikes.
[01:22:14.634 --> 01:22:16.275]  They've already had eight of them.
[01:22:16.275 --> 01:22:19.698]  And to stop announcing, they say, five more at least the next year.
[01:22:19.698 --> 01:22:21.639]  And, you know, to signal, hey, you've done enough.
[01:22:21.639 --> 01:22:25.682]  Because clearly, they're trying to kill this market.
[01:22:25.682 --> 01:22:26.943]  We'll get Matt Braggart's take on that.
[01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:28.164]  But first, let me give you the big news.
[01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:34.695]  Megyn Kelly is out in NBC just 48 hours after a blackface scandal.
[01:22:34.695 --> 01:22:39.960]  May walk away with $69 million in payout from her five-year contract.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.522]  This woman is a corrupt lawyer in my view.
[01:22:42.522 --> 01:22:43.803]  A liar.
[01:22:43.803 --> 01:22:45.404]  I told her I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:22:45.404 --> 01:22:47.926]  She edited the tape where it didn't look like that.
[01:22:47.926 --> 01:22:51.949]  And I'll just let everybody know that she's obviously going to get litigated against.
[01:22:51.949 --> 01:22:53.691]  And this whole Sandy Hook thing out of Connecticut.
[01:22:54.631 --> 01:23:21.333]  So you wait till the jury and everybody sees that and the deception and we've got not much more time to follow on her but and I just want to remind well I'm gonna get I'm gonna get to that cuz you know she really is amazing and here's the thing she made the point that if it's Halloween I mean like Tropic Thunder you know you got a white guy playing a black guy or vice versa the idea that you're being racist it's all the intention I actually agree with her on that statement but here's the point
[01:23:22.805 --> 01:23:29.475]  They use that to get rid of her just like they use sexual harassment they've covered up forever to get rid of all those other people at NBC.
[01:23:29.475 --> 01:23:32.479]  And they get rid of people at CBS.
[01:23:32.479 --> 01:23:38.688]  So it's just funny to see her destroyed in the jaws of her own political correctness where they eat their own.
[01:23:40.862 --> 01:23:47.865]  But the false flag, all of it, is to distract from the economy, to distract from the Democrats pushing for that, and distract from the caravan.
[01:23:47.865 --> 01:23:53.848]  Do you agree with that, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, ordinance expert, best-selling author, folks who've joined us, enemiesfiredomestic.com?
[01:23:53.848 --> 01:23:55.549]  Do you agree with what I just said?
[01:23:55.549 --> 01:24:02.812]  And then at gut level, instinct level, your sword says, 12 days out, let's not get too cocky here.
[01:24:02.812 --> 01:24:04.453]  What else should we be worried about?
[01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:09.051]  Just a comment on Megan Kelly.
[01:24:09.051 --> 01:24:12.253]  I can relate that also to what's happening with Kurt Schilling.
[01:24:12.253 --> 01:24:25.898]  He was the 2004 Red Sox World Series hero, and for PC reasons he's disinvited because he's considered Islamophobic for hosting a cartoon on social media.
[01:24:25.898 --> 01:24:30.600]  So he's being unpersoned by his own organization, the Red Sox.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:34.141]  However, more and more people are seeing this as the loony left.
[01:24:34.622 --> 01:24:38.583]  Going further and further out towards, you know, crazy PC world.
[01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:43.545]  And I think that more and more moderate liberals are peeling away and getting red-pilled by this.
[01:24:43.545 --> 01:24:50.607]  So I'm hopeful that while their craziness is cranking up in intensity, they're losing membership.
[01:24:50.607 --> 01:24:53.608]  And we might see that reflected in the midterms.
[01:24:53.608 --> 01:24:56.989]  But as far as what we're going to see next, I think that the
[01:24:57.749 --> 01:25:03.611]  The bomb hoax is going to be a fizzle, especially if it turns out to be a liberal doing a false flag.
[01:25:03.611 --> 01:25:04.391]  No, I agree.
[01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:07.673]  And my fear is they're going to go from fake to real.
[01:25:07.673 --> 01:25:08.753]  But what do you think about my point?
[01:25:08.753 --> 01:25:10.393]  They don't have command and control anymore.
[01:25:10.393 --> 01:25:11.574]  That's why they're going with hoaxes.
[01:25:12.861 --> 01:25:14.002]  That's all they've got.
[01:25:14.002 --> 01:25:26.030]  Now, at a much bigger level, we've seen Soros, you know, over decades, willing to crash economies, you know, trash currencies, to, you know, to destabilize countries.
[01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:28.952]  Well, he's always had a hard-on for the U.S.
[01:25:28.952 --> 01:25:30.993]  Well, we're the main enemy.
[01:25:30.993 --> 01:25:32.575]  For him, we're the main enemy.
[01:25:32.575 --> 01:25:38.719]  The globalists cannot permit to exist any successful, affluent nations.
[01:25:39.395 --> 01:25:51.223]  They need to bring every successful nation down to the median, which will be incompetent, balkanized, tribal, low IQ, unsuccessful serfs.
[01:25:51.223 --> 01:25:54.325]  And then they'll be the elite masters of all.
[01:25:54.325 --> 01:25:56.647]  And they have to get rid of the good examples.
[01:25:56.647 --> 01:26:01.430]  That's why Sweden, Germany, America are our primary targets in this.
[01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:04.072]  But, you know, I think that people are seeing it for what it is.
[01:26:04.072 --> 01:26:08.315]  And that's, I think, a lot thanks to InfoWars and Matt Drudge and a few others.
[01:26:08.675 --> 01:26:14.878]  You know, my first novel that I wrote in 2003, excuse me, it starts with a false flag.
[01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:16.679]  It's a false flag novel.
[01:26:16.679 --> 01:26:28.585]  And in that one, the shooter that is allegedly shoots into a football stadium is a deranged, semi, you know, semi nuts, homeless veteran.
[01:26:28.585 --> 01:26:30.566]  And he's shot by the SWAT team.
[01:26:30.566 --> 01:26:32.607]  So he can't, you know, defend himself.
[01:26:33.214 --> 01:26:35.575]  The clues are all left in his trailer.
[01:26:35.575 --> 01:26:38.997]  You know, he didn't do the shooting, but he's set up to be the shooter.
[01:26:38.997 --> 01:26:48.503]  So, it could possibly be that when they find the bomber, it's at the end of a chase and a shootout in a fiery crash.
[01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:52.845]  And inside of the car, you know, will be some right winger.
[01:26:52.845 --> 01:26:54.286]  Can't rule that out.
[01:26:54.286 --> 01:26:55.347]  Just want to put it out there.
[01:26:55.347 --> 01:27:00.710]  Oh, that's exactly... I mean, everybody knows that it's like the shooter with Mark Wahlberg is a very real-type scenario.
[01:27:01.485 --> 01:27:02.205]  Right.
[01:27:02.205 --> 01:27:04.946]  Yeah, Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter was the novel.
[01:27:04.946 --> 01:27:08.487]  The novel's a lot better than the movie, actually.
[01:27:08.487 --> 01:27:12.589]  But, yeah, they would like to do that, but I don't think it's really possible.
[01:27:12.589 --> 01:27:15.810]  I just put it out as a hypothesis in case that does happen.
[01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:21.271]  You know, if the guy is killed in a shootout and his body is burned, I won't accept that he really was the right person.
[01:27:21.271 --> 01:27:21.852]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:27:21.852 --> 01:27:26.833]  It may have just been low-level antifa getting with the false flag narrative out of New York and doing it.
[01:27:26.833 --> 01:27:28.974]  Even a certain professor I think of, we're not going to show him.
[01:27:29.614 --> 01:27:31.475]  And I'm just saying that's kind of the M.O.
[01:27:31.475 --> 01:27:32.716]  of these people.
[01:27:32.716 --> 01:27:35.938]  And then now the globalists can't help but jump on it to use it.
[01:27:35.938 --> 01:27:49.185]  But then if it turns out to be a patsy false flag, whoever did this I think is in danger, not from us, but from the globalists who now have gone with the narrative and are going to try to find out who it is, and before the FBI can get to them, kill them.
[01:27:50.287 --> 01:27:50.947]  Definitely.
[01:27:50.947 --> 01:27:53.908]  And plant more right-wing material on them.
[01:27:53.908 --> 01:27:56.309]  And let's not forget about the caravan.
[01:27:56.309 --> 01:27:58.530]  The caravan's only on the back burner.
[01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:02.812]  But as more and more of them get put on in buses and on flatbed trucks,
[01:28:03.502 --> 01:28:07.883]  Their goal is to get to the border before the midterms, no mistake about that.
[01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:19.125]  And it won't take all 14 or 20,000, just a couple thousand, mostly, you know, as many women and children as possible, storming the border in a visible place so that our troops are tear-gassing them.
[01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:31.148]  And then it's the new Kent State, and then we have a civil emergency, and then Antifa has their excuse to start burning buildings and trying to trigger African-Americans having riots, which we know from Alexander Soros' own group, the plan is to get blacks to riot.
[01:28:32.623 --> 01:28:34.585]  I don't think that's going to work with the caravan.
[01:28:34.585 --> 01:28:36.107]  That won't work with the caravan.
[01:28:36.107 --> 01:28:36.467]  No, no, I agree.
[01:28:36.467 --> 01:28:37.688]  Blacks are against it, too.
[01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:39.410]  Well, let's talk more about the caravan when we come back.
[01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:47.237]  I'm going to give the number out for law enforcement and former military with expertise in EOD, unscreened, as long as you're calling in on the subject.
[01:28:47.237 --> 01:28:49.419]  Tell us what you think about this.
[01:28:49.419 --> 01:28:51.061]  Tell us what you think as experts.
[01:28:51.061 --> 01:28:54.044]  Only law enforcement and EOD military personnel.
[01:28:54.044 --> 01:28:55.385]  Straight ahead, I'll give the number out.
[01:28:55.385 --> 01:28:55.826]  Stand by.
[01:28:57.668 --> 01:28:58.889]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.889 --> 01:29:04.273]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:04.273 --> 01:29:07.175]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:10.757]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:29:58.314 --> 01:29:58.334]  X2.
[01:30:28.914 --> 01:30:31.336]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[01:30:31.336 --> 01:30:33.056]  Ordered it six months ago.
[01:30:33.056 --> 01:30:34.057]  So I get the price down.
[01:30:34.057 --> 01:30:35.798]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:30:35.798 --> 01:30:37.038]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:30:37.038 --> 01:30:38.999]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[01:30:38.999 --> 01:30:41.380]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.861]  In fact, right now, it is the last run.
[01:30:42.861 --> 01:30:45.202]  It's a viable shield X2.
[01:30:45.202 --> 01:30:46.683]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[01:30:46.683 --> 01:30:48.644]  It'll be gone a couple months.

[01:31:46.964 --> 01:31:48.345]  Nobody can get it at that price.

[01:32:43.929 --> 01:32:47.231]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:32:47.231 --> 01:32:49.231]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:52.553]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:32:52.553 --> 01:32:55.094]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:32:55.094 --> 01:33:01.217]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[01:33:01.217 --> 01:33:03.838]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.605 --> 01:33:29.690]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.690 --> 01:33:40.456]  Well, CNN famously, a whole bunch of times, would put under me, KKK leader.
[01:33:40.456 --> 01:33:43.738]  But then they were doing a promo for another show coming up.
[01:33:43.738 --> 01:33:45.619]  But they would put it up like it was me.
[01:33:47.352 --> 01:33:55.734]  And they've done it again, search intensifies, manhunt for serial bomber, going after Trump's targets.
[01:33:55.734 --> 01:34:14.118]  So if Trump says to the news, saying, we want to kill the president, he's a Nazi, we want to overthrow him, and then he says, you're liars, you're fake news, well then, if somebody mails a, or delivers a fake bomb to them, oh, they're just these poor little victims.
[01:34:14.118 --> 01:34:15.278]  This is insanely.
[01:34:16.559 --> 01:34:18.160]  Insanely.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.021]  Obvious and ridiculous.
[01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:27.405]  So, did the false flag, I think it's fair to say that, everybody from Lou Dobbs, the former Deputy Director of the FBI to, you know, you name it, are coming out and saying that.
[01:34:27.405 --> 01:34:28.526]  Where do they go next?
[01:34:28.526 --> 01:34:30.487]  We'll talk to Matt Bracken for one more segment.
[01:34:30.487 --> 01:34:38.512]  And then, we have former head of CIA psychological operations, State Department operations, he doesn't want me to even say all that, but he was the former head of it.
[01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:41.851]  Change the regimes of at least nine countries.
[01:34:41.851 --> 01:34:43.612]  I mean, he's been in the deepest of the deep.
[01:34:43.612 --> 01:34:45.214]  One of the co-founders of Delta Force.
[01:34:45.214 --> 01:34:47.075]  He's a psychiatrist, a lot of other stuff.
[01:34:47.075 --> 01:34:53.819]  Dr. Steve Pchenik, very interesting guy, is going to be joining us coming up last 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:34:53.819 --> 01:34:57.021]  That's as soon as he can get back to his house to give his take.
[01:34:57.021 --> 01:34:57.962]  I don't even know his take yet.
[01:34:58.834 --> 01:35:00.975]  That's always interesting on this.
[01:35:00.975 --> 01:35:07.657]  I've got a sneaking suspicion what it's going to be and the type of psychological boobs that he thinks are behind it.
[01:35:07.657 --> 01:35:08.697]  We'll look at all that.
[01:35:08.697 --> 01:35:13.038]  But I want to, in the next segment, and then for a few segments before he joins us, you don't have to worry.
[01:35:13.038 --> 01:35:17.720]  I'll get to your calls quickly because it's just going to be law enforcement, EOD, former military EOD.
[01:35:19.141 --> 01:35:20.582]  People specifically.
[01:35:20.582 --> 01:35:24.305]  Not to say who you are or even where you're calling from if you don't want, but just your take.
[01:35:24.305 --> 01:35:28.548]  Because you've got all these other EOD experts, even on CNN, MSNBC, NBC.
[01:35:28.548 --> 01:35:30.590]  They can't get them to lie.
[01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:31.571]  They're like, this is plastic.
[01:35:31.571 --> 01:35:32.752]  It doesn't have caps on it.
[01:35:32.752 --> 01:35:34.353]  There's wires on both ends.
[01:35:34.353 --> 01:35:35.213]  They have stickers on them.
[01:35:35.213 --> 01:35:36.134]  They weren't meant to blow up.
[01:35:36.134 --> 01:35:36.975]  This is psychological.
[01:35:37.915 --> 01:35:39.316]  And then we go, we already said that.
[01:35:39.316 --> 01:35:41.798]  They're like, how dare you say bombing isn't real?
[01:35:41.798 --> 01:35:49.504]  I'm worried whoever's doing this might mail a real bomb to some innocent mail carrier and blow up somebody to say, sheesh, somebody's dead.
[01:35:49.504 --> 01:36:01.093]  I think the fact that this has been such a hoax, they may kill somebody to just give it that stinky aftertaste to try to sting us, making the point this is fake.
[01:36:01.093 --> 01:36:02.334]  That's kind of a gut level deal.
[01:36:02.334 --> 01:36:04.316]  I hate to give them ideas, but I've just got to put this out.
[01:36:05.555 --> 01:36:24.329]  We'll get Matt Bracken's take on that in a minute, but first, I say this, and I say this, and I say this, and I just wanna slow down on all the things we talk about, and remember, we're being shut down, and we're being blocked, and they're trying to attack us because we're telling the truth and we're effective.
[01:36:24.329 --> 01:36:34.857]  And without you listening on radio, watching on TV, watching on the internet, looking at Infowars.com, Newswars.com, without you, we're nothing.
[01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:40.252]  So I haven't always, you know, just said you're the resistance to make you feel good.
[01:36:40.252 --> 01:36:42.433]  You are the resistance of the globalists.
[01:36:42.433 --> 01:36:44.214]  They call themselves the resistance?
[01:36:44.214 --> 01:36:45.575]  We haven't taken the whole country back.
[01:36:45.575 --> 01:36:46.716]  We haven't defeated globalism.
[01:36:46.716 --> 01:36:48.477]  We're still just the resistance.
[01:36:48.477 --> 01:36:49.117]  Believe me.
[01:36:49.117 --> 01:36:55.302]  When we're not, and I say, well, we've basically defeated the globalists, but there's pockets of them, I've got to then say, we've got to be tolerant.
[01:36:55.302 --> 01:36:56.382]  We've got to be open.
[01:36:56.382 --> 01:36:57.263]  We're now in power.
[01:36:57.263 --> 01:36:58.604]  We're not in power.
[01:36:58.604 --> 01:36:59.684]  We don't control the media.
[01:36:59.684 --> 01:37:02.987]  We don't control the big banks, the foreign corporations, the chi-coms.
[01:37:02.987 --> 01:37:04.468]  We have limited control.
[01:37:05.601 --> 01:37:21.106]  of the executive and the legislative and now the judiciary, but only because it got so obvious and so bad that people trained that swore oaths to this country finally said, okay, we've got to actually stop the Democrats that are cancer and cut them out.
[01:37:21.106 --> 01:37:24.568]  And it's still not clear whether we're going to survive the surgery as a country.
[01:37:24.568 --> 01:37:28.829]  So we're in a massive hundred hour operation here.
[01:37:28.829 --> 01:37:30.810]  And our heart rate came back a little bit.
[01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:34.231]  And so they're trying to pile on plunging the stock market to kill us.
[01:37:35.862 --> 01:37:37.323]  The show.
[01:37:37.323 --> 01:37:41.125]  Those interviews with Matt Bracken yesterday, laying out how the bombs are fake, and now it's all confirmed.
[01:37:41.125 --> 01:37:43.067]  Those are gold.
[01:37:43.067 --> 01:37:51.913]  The articles that Paul Watson's written, that I've written, that others have put out, that Kit Daniels and Don Salazar and Jamie White and the rest of the crew, get them out!
[01:37:51.913 --> 01:37:54.054]  And they censor InfoWars a lot.
[01:37:54.054 --> 01:37:56.175]  NewsWars is the one to get out.
[01:37:56.175 --> 01:37:56.816]  It's not as censored.
[01:37:56.816 --> 01:38:00.979]  We're going to start launching more sites, too, so they've got to ban each one, and then a month later there's a new one.
[01:38:00.979 --> 01:38:04.161]  You know, the tattoos we're going to use, but NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:38:05.542 --> 01:38:09.505]  Word of mouth though now, people are more ready to listen to InfoWars than ever.
[01:38:09.505 --> 01:38:10.386]  Hey, you've heard of InfoWars?
[01:38:10.386 --> 01:38:12.327]  Yeah, it's all over the news and it's evil.
[01:38:12.327 --> 01:38:14.789]  Well, why don't you find out what it's actually saying?
[01:38:14.789 --> 01:38:17.331]  Because it's forbidden.
[01:38:17.331 --> 01:38:18.412]  It's verboten.
[01:38:18.412 --> 01:38:20.354]  InfoWars.com.
[01:38:20.354 --> 01:38:21.594]  You are the ambassadors.
[01:38:21.594 --> 01:38:22.375]  You are the brain.
[01:38:22.375 --> 01:38:23.136]  You are the heart.
[01:38:23.136 --> 01:38:24.196]  You are the will.
[01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:26.338]  You are the entire system of resistance.
[01:38:26.338 --> 01:38:27.699]  So, do that please.
[01:38:27.699 --> 01:38:28.240]  And don't forget,
[01:38:29.468 --> 01:38:31.689]  We've got to end the super sale.
[01:38:31.689 --> 01:38:35.830]  We did get a new payment processor, so we've got a backup.
[01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:37.991]  They've targeted six of them, got rid of five.
[01:38:37.991 --> 01:38:40.292]  That was really scary.
[01:38:40.292 --> 01:38:46.815]  So I said, we're going to sell all our products, all the great supplements, everything at 50% off and free shipping.
[01:38:46.815 --> 01:38:50.576]  The Christmas sales, the Black Friday sales, all of them were rolled into one.
[01:38:52.395 --> 01:38:56.577]  And now, we've been successful at a lot of the inventory that was meant for those cells being gone.
[01:38:56.577 --> 01:39:01.939]  So it means that other cells coming up will still be decent, but not as big and not as widespread.
[01:39:01.939 --> 01:39:15.364]  So get your products today, whether it's Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste that's so great, or Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, or Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, or Vitamineral Fusion, or Knockout, or Real Red Pill Plus, or Silver Bullet.
[01:39:15.364 --> 01:39:17.525]  It's all 50% off.
[01:39:17.525 --> 01:39:19.406]  A lot of these are lost liters at that price.
[01:39:19.406 --> 01:39:20.807]  Sinopharado ship an additional 10% off.
[01:39:22.395 --> 01:39:26.496]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, and the sales will end by Sunday.
[01:39:26.496 --> 01:39:30.236]  I've got new specials on Monday that are really good, but they're gonna be limited.
[01:39:30.236 --> 01:39:32.897]  So this is the new special, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:32.897 --> 01:39:35.197]  Okay, Matt, thanks for holding during that.
[01:39:35.197 --> 01:39:43.259]  The toll-free number for law enforcement, military experts on things like that to be able to call in on is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, on what they think about the bomb, what they
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.123]  They think about all these bombs, but they think about the timing, the motive, and so much more.
[01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:56.423]  877-789-2539.
[01:39:56.423 --> 01:40:02.006]  But Matt, in the time we have left, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:40:02.006 --> 01:40:04.448]  What are you really worried about now that they're cornered rats?
[01:40:04.448 --> 01:40:05.428]  I agree with you.
[01:40:05.428 --> 01:40:07.410]  What are they going to pull next?
[01:40:07.410 --> 01:40:13.253]  Well, I've got a few more things about the bomb that just occurred to me.
[01:40:13.253 --> 01:40:19.897]  By showing the addresses, the big labels, the fonts, they've made it very easy for copycats
[01:40:20.489 --> 01:40:27.994]  They've basically provided something that will look like it came from this bomber that anybody can generate at home and send from anywhere.
[01:40:27.994 --> 01:40:31.476]  So, they're kind of encouraging copycats that way.
[01:40:31.476 --> 01:40:34.157]  I think it was a mistake to show so much right off the bat.
[01:40:34.157 --> 01:40:37.199]  That picture, I think, gave away too much information.
[01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:38.800]  It just helps copycats.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.042]  That actual hoax bomb there with the wires at each end,
[01:40:42.594 --> 01:40:53.902]  And the fact that it was PVC and had no black powder tells me that it's not somebody even capable of making a real bomb like you suggested, you know, to show that they're serious.
[01:40:53.902 --> 01:41:08.153]  I don't think that the person that made that could make a real bomb or they would have packed black powder in it, even with no initiation method, just so that it would be reported that they had black powder explosive, an explosive potential.
[01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:11.704]  The way they are, they have no explosive potential.
[01:41:11.704 --> 01:41:19.528]  If somebody was really trying to make an effective hoax, they would have put black powder into them, even with no ability to detonate them.
[01:41:19.528 --> 01:41:27.771]  So I think that they are encouraging copycats, and we could potentially see a real bomb, but it won't be from this bomber.
[01:41:27.771 --> 01:41:29.292]  Not this time.
[01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:31.313]  This bomber's done, and I think they'll be arrested.
[01:41:33.297 --> 01:41:41.409]  And so if it was just somebody responding, like you said, to the political pheromones to do this to false flag Republicans, how embarrassing will that be to the Democrats?
[01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:47.152]  It'll be devastating if it turns out to be a left winger.
[01:41:47.152 --> 01:42:00.318]  But on the other hand, if it's a more elaborate plot than we know and they've got some patsy stashed away to die in a SWAT shootout, then who knows?
[01:42:00.318 --> 01:42:02.659]  But I don't think that's very likely.
[01:42:02.659 --> 01:42:04.660]  In fact, I think that's very unlikely.
[01:42:05.566 --> 01:42:06.827]  What about the economic angle?
[01:42:06.827 --> 01:42:14.835]  I mean, the Federal Reserve admits they're trying to, quote, make the economy stop overheating, when it's far from overheating, we're trying to recover.
[01:42:14.835 --> 01:42:17.898]  I don't think that they can do anything in this time frame.
[01:42:17.898 --> 01:42:22.823]  I don't think that there's some button they could push without really giving away their game, you know.
[01:42:23.832 --> 01:42:24.072]  We're good.
[01:42:42.483 --> 01:42:44.064]  Gotta get rid of that private fellow reserve.
[01:42:44.064 --> 01:42:45.826]  We'll talk about the stock market crash.
[01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:47.908]  Take your phone calls and more straight ahead.
[01:42:47.908 --> 01:42:48.708]  Thank you, Matt Bracken.
[01:42:48.708 --> 01:42:50.230]  Appreciate you joining us.
[01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:51.150]  Thanks.

[01:42:55.134 --> 01:42:57.035]  Spread those links.

[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:04.441]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.

[01:43:47.405 --> 01:43:52.928]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos of 90% of the Trump supporters being huge InfoWare supporters?
[01:43:52.928 --> 01:43:54.028]  It scared them to death.
[01:43:54.028 --> 01:43:55.589]  It's why they want to extinguish us.
[01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:56.670]  But you won't let them!

[01:44:55.375 --> 01:45:02.178]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:45:03.539 --> 01:45:12.230]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:14.213]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:45:14.213 --> 01:45:17.677]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:45:17.677 --> 01:45:20.300]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.782]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:45:22.563 --> 01:45:34.973]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[01:45:36.147 --> 01:45:39.851]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:45:39.851 --> 01:45:41.052]  We'll win.
[01:45:41.052 --> 01:45:43.355]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:45:43.355 --> 01:45:49.261]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[01:45:49.261 --> 01:45:51.103]  And you're right, to the market.
[01:45:51.103 --> 01:45:54.807]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globals may win.
[01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:56.028]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[01:45:56.028 --> 01:45:57.029]  We need your support.
[01:45:57.029 --> 01:45:57.770]  I'm counting on you.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:02.564]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[01:46:02.564 --> 01:46:06.027]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[01:46:06.027 --> 01:46:07.789]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[01:46:07.789 --> 01:46:11.072]  They know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products.
[01:46:11.072 --> 01:46:17.858]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:46:17.858 --> 01:46:22.943]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[01:46:23.263 --> 01:46:29.366]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:46:29.366 --> 01:46:32.347]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:46:32.347 --> 01:46:33.448]  I want to keep going.
[01:46:33.448 --> 01:46:37.289]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:46:37.289 --> 01:46:39.290]  I want to push all the way.
[01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:40.591]  I've committed to do that.
[01:46:40.591 --> 01:46:41.671]  I've prayed for that.
[01:46:41.671 --> 01:46:43.312]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:46:43.312 --> 01:46:46.253]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:46:46.253 --> 01:46:47.574]  I will never falter.
[01:46:47.574 --> 01:46:49.595]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:46:49.875 --> 01:47:01.188]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and 4Wars4.com to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[01:47:01.188 --> 01:47:03.831]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:32.831 --> 01:47:45.014]  So, we're in an information war, and you've got 10 Democrats who keep saying Republicans are going to kill them, I'm going to kill them, Trump's going to kill them, while they're calling for violence against us.
[01:47:45.014 --> 01:47:46.735]  Suddenly getting sent these dummy bombs.
[01:47:46.735 --> 01:47:57.797]  You've got all these different law enforcement groups and EOD specialists saying they appear to be fake or not effective bombs.
[01:47:57.797 --> 01:48:00.058]  So, why would somebody mail something like this?
[01:48:01.809 --> 01:48:13.074]  You've got the former Assistant Deputy Director of the FBI, going on Fox News, saying Culper could be someone who is trying to get Democratic vote out to incur sympathy.
[01:48:13.074 --> 01:48:13.994]  We haven't got the motive.
[01:48:13.994 --> 01:48:16.535]  It's all there.
[01:48:16.535 --> 01:48:18.316]  So what happens next?
[01:48:18.316 --> 01:48:28.741]  So I want to open the phones up for people that have worked in law enforcement, the military, in and around ordinance and the bomb squad and the EOD.
[01:48:29.974 --> 01:48:31.695]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:48:31.695 --> 01:48:44.701]  We're not screening your calls, just that, you know, you say you're law enforcement or current law, or former military, because, you know, I've got a lot of guys I talk to that are current or former, and they obviously can't come on air with their names and who they are.
[01:48:44.701 --> 01:48:53.786]  So instead, we'll just open the phones up, and it's always informative, and we'll do that right now with Steve, Spencer, Jeff, Devon, and others.
[01:48:53.786 --> 01:48:56.047]  Now let's go ahead and go to Spencer first in North Carolina.
[01:48:56.047 --> 01:48:57.207]  It says they're former EOD.
[01:48:59.167 --> 01:49:03.410]  Most of the folks that handle ordinance at its disposal and with the Marine Corps.
[01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:05.151]  So, formerly with the Marine Corps.
[01:49:05.151 --> 01:49:08.493]  So, what do you think about all this?
[01:49:08.493 --> 01:49:14.958]  Well, I believe basically what you're saying is true as far as the reason behind it.
[01:49:14.958 --> 01:49:17.680]  But when I was in the Marine Corps, I specialized in IEDs.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.002]  And to a trained eye, you can tell just by looking at these devices.
[01:49:21.002 --> 01:49:25.485]  And slow down, because a lot of folks aren't an improvised explosive device expert like you.
[01:49:25.485 --> 01:49:26.626]  So, walk us through that.
[01:49:28.035 --> 01:49:35.799]  Yeah, so there's four basic parts to an IED, and it just looks like these pictures.
[01:49:35.799 --> 01:49:36.739]  They look fake.
[01:49:36.739 --> 01:49:37.740]  They look juvenile.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.261]  They're definitely JV.
[01:49:40.261 --> 01:49:41.762]  They don't look like they were made to go off.
[01:49:41.762 --> 01:49:45.063]  It looks like they were made to be obviously spotted.
[01:49:45.063 --> 01:49:46.324]  There's no doubt.
[01:49:48.949 --> 01:50:00.092]  So, because from your experience, they try to bury IEDs or put it in a milk carton or make it look like garbage or look like an old tire, but instead, the packages, all of it's meant to stand out.
[01:50:00.092 --> 01:50:00.533]  Exactly.
[01:50:00.533 --> 01:50:06.774]  You would never build it like that if you really wanted it to design as functioned, or function as designed.
[01:50:06.774 --> 01:50:09.035]  It's just, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:11.936]  This was definitely a cry for attention.
[01:50:14.522 --> 01:50:23.966]  What about the fact that it's thin plastic, now they're saying probably not even PVC, with no caps, with some glass, and they're not even sure it even had black powder in it.
[01:50:23.966 --> 01:50:28.807]  I mean, a lot of experts are saying this wouldn't even probably detonate or do anything.
[01:50:28.807 --> 01:50:29.888]  No, I mean, it doesn't look like it.
[01:50:29.888 --> 01:50:32.989]  And the thing, yeah, you wouldn't want to use PVC or something like that.
[01:50:32.989 --> 01:50:39.491]  You would want for there to be a lot of pressure inside so that the overpressure creates the biggest blast possible.
[01:50:39.491 --> 01:50:43.833]  So yes, so to put it inside of something soft like that doesn't make any sense.
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:53.464]  You know, the Democrats are this pathetic now, because they did all this pre-hype, and I'm asking your opinion, you're a smart guy, because different angles are important.
[01:50:53.464 --> 01:51:06.110]  They hype that Trump and I are going to get them killed, and we're going to bomb them and shoot them, and then lie and say that we're calling for bombing and shooting, all over the news, and so I go, 2 plus 2 equals, clearly they're going to stage something and blame me.
[01:51:06.110 --> 01:51:08.531]  But then, 14 days out, we're now 12 days out,
[01:51:10.233 --> 01:51:12.053]  This ham-fisted idiocy.
[01:51:12.053 --> 01:51:13.754]  The whole media jumps on it.
[01:51:13.754 --> 01:51:14.894]  They're foaming at the mouth.
[01:51:14.894 --> 01:51:17.975]  It's so obvious they're trying to pander for sympathy.
[01:51:17.975 --> 01:51:19.976]  So is this what Hillary is reduced to?
[01:51:19.976 --> 01:51:22.136]  Because she's still in charge of the Democrats.
[01:51:22.136 --> 01:51:28.278]  So I would, you know, defer that she's probably, or infer that she's in charge.
[01:51:28.278 --> 01:51:29.378]  What's your take on that?
[01:51:29.378 --> 01:51:33.959]  Because A, there's so much forensic evidence this is going to lead back to somebody.
[01:51:33.959 --> 01:51:35.299]  Is it a patsy they're setting up?
[01:51:35.299 --> 01:51:37.120]  Or why is this so badly done?
[01:51:38.735 --> 01:51:47.322]  Yeah, I mean, I believe it's either Apache, whether they're wittingly involved or they were lied to and tricked into it.
[01:51:47.322 --> 01:51:51.525]  But I mean, I don't really think the Democrats are stooped to any level.
[01:51:51.525 --> 01:51:53.827]  I think they've always been this low of a level.
[01:51:53.827 --> 01:51:54.848]  They're just revealing it now.
[01:51:55.498 --> 01:51:56.599]  Oh, I totally forgot.
[01:51:56.599 --> 01:51:59.201]  I should have covered this two segments ago.
[01:51:59.201 --> 01:52:01.823]  Oh my God, it was huge breaking news.
[01:52:01.823 --> 01:52:10.348]  The creepy porn lawyer and the lady he represented, the Senate has referred them for criminal investigation for perjury and lying to federal law enforcement.
[01:52:10.348 --> 01:52:11.389]  So I should have covered that.
[01:52:11.389 --> 01:52:11.950]  I'm sorry.
[01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:14.231]  It's here in my innumerable stack.
[01:52:14.231 --> 01:52:15.332]  So we'll cover that.
[01:52:15.332 --> 01:52:16.493]  We'll start the next hour briefly.
[01:52:16.493 --> 01:52:17.754]  I'll continue with calls.
[01:52:17.754 --> 01:52:18.474]  Thank you so much.
[01:52:18.474 --> 01:52:19.995]  Anything else, Spencer?
[01:52:19.995 --> 01:52:20.436]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:20.436 --> 01:52:25.059]  Actually, this is off topic, but I wanted to see what your thoughts were on the Gitmo
[01:52:26.075 --> 01:52:26.615]  Do you think
[01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.769]  Yes.
[01:53:19.029 --> 01:53:22.113]  You think it's getting prepped for some of the high-level demons?
[01:53:42.045 --> 01:53:46.911]  But then, you know, whoever the Q people are, they say, I'm a bad guy.
[01:53:46.911 --> 01:53:51.537]  So it really makes it hard to gauge or believe.
[01:53:51.537 --> 01:53:54.400]  But these folks know what we want to hear.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.924]  I really think that if Hillary and Soros and others
[01:53:58.660 --> 01:53:59.100]  I mean, I'm hoping.
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:00.140]  I'm hoping it's really being set up for that.
[01:54:26.952 --> 01:54:28.996]  It's just so hard to see what people are doing.
[01:54:28.996 --> 01:54:35.848]  Yeah, because I know I heard about the sealed indictments, and I was just wondering what your thoughts were on it.
[01:54:35.848 --> 01:54:40.135]  Well, you know, I mean, from what I know, Trump is really pissed at the Justice Department, sitting on their butt.
[01:54:41.050 --> 01:54:46.852]  And so, you hear about these sealed indictments and all the rest of it, and again, it's like fortune cookies or lottery tickets.
[01:54:46.852 --> 01:54:51.874]  People want it to be true, and I just don't think that is the case.
[01:54:51.874 --> 01:54:54.335]  Alright, thank you.
[01:54:54.335 --> 01:54:55.595]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:55.595 --> 01:54:57.596]  That doesn't mean Trump isn't going to try to lock them up.
[01:54:57.596 --> 01:54:59.516]  After all, we have the Hillary shirt.
[01:54:59.516 --> 01:55:01.237]  Hillary for prison.
[01:55:01.237 --> 01:55:03.798]  And we want them to pay.
[01:55:03.798 --> 01:55:04.458]  It's just that
[01:55:06.274 --> 01:55:09.016]  Trump's doing everything very, very transparently.
[01:55:09.016 --> 01:55:10.778]  Because he's under the gun.
[01:55:10.778 --> 01:55:14.301]  And so I just really don't put a lot of stock in that stuff.
[01:55:14.301 --> 01:55:14.861]  But we'll see.
[01:55:14.861 --> 01:55:15.802]  Thank you.
[01:55:15.802 --> 01:55:19.225]  Okay, Steve in Indiana, then Jeff and Devin and others.
[01:55:19.225 --> 01:55:23.588]  Steve in Indiana, former Air Force EOD, Ordnance and Ordnance Disposal.
[01:55:23.588 --> 01:55:25.930]  What is your take on this?
[01:55:25.930 --> 01:55:31.935]  Well, Alex, I started hearing this, I was getting alerts on my phone.
[01:55:31.935 --> 01:55:35.198]  And as soon as I started seeing the alerts, and it was very, very
[01:55:36.344 --> 01:55:37.745]  Uh, the very beginnings of it.
[01:55:37.745 --> 01:55:40.566]  They didn't even know what they had yet.
[01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:45.729]  And I was, I was thinking back to what you said a couple of weeks ago, how they were going to start setting you guys up.
[01:55:45.729 --> 01:55:49.431]  You know, they were already softening the ground.
[01:55:49.431 --> 01:55:54.794]  And I didn't even have to see these things to know that it was going to be amateur hour.
[01:55:54.794 --> 01:55:56.315]  And it totally is.
[01:55:56.315 --> 01:55:59.176]  These things look so fake.
[01:55:59.176 --> 01:56:02.178]  It's, it's absolutely astounding that they even put those things out there.
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.001]  But it's like Balazi Ford.
[01:56:06.001 --> 01:56:07.903]  How fake does that bug-eyed demon look?
[01:56:07.903 --> 01:56:09.124]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:56:09.124 --> 01:56:10.985]  It's crazy.
[01:56:10.985 --> 01:56:13.247]  It's just, I don't even know what they're thinking.
[01:56:13.247 --> 01:56:15.209]  It's like we're dealing with retards.
[01:56:15.209 --> 01:56:19.452]  I don't know what is going on, but it's so transparent.
[01:56:19.452 --> 01:56:25.797]  I mean, anybody that's ever dealt with any kind of improvised explosive device would look at that.
[01:56:25.797 --> 01:56:29.320]  That is not anything that you would ever use in any situation.
[01:56:31.437 --> 01:56:37.141]  It was, it was so ridiculous that I was, when I actually saw pictures of it, I was like, you've got to be kidding me!
[01:56:37.141 --> 01:56:44.847]  Well, as somebody that professionally, you know, dealt with bombs, tell us, tell Phil what you see about these devices.
[01:56:44.847 --> 01:56:53.674]  First off, you, if you, it was mailed through the mail, like, um, I can't remember the guy's name that you have on, uh, the former SEAL.
[01:56:53.674 --> 01:56:54.815]  Um, he's Matt Bracken.
[01:56:54.815 --> 01:56:55.676]  You do this.
[01:56:55.676 --> 01:56:55.856]  Yeah.
[01:56:55.856 --> 01:56:57.317]  Matt Bracken.
[01:56:57.317 --> 01:56:57.417]  Um,
[01:56:58.365 --> 01:57:09.531]  You do this so that when somebody opens it, it makes contact or it, you know, something, like you were saying, like a mousetrap type of device, like a cock striker, something like that would happen.
[01:57:09.531 --> 01:57:17.736]  Most likely it'd be like if you had two pieces of aluminum foil, you'd slide it apart, it'd break contact or it would make contact and then it would go off.
[01:57:17.736 --> 01:57:19.917]  You're not going to put a clock on there.
[01:57:19.917 --> 01:57:21.418]  Why would you put a clock on there?
[01:57:21.418 --> 01:57:22.339]  That's ridiculous.
[01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:26.570]  It was absolutely ludicrous.
[01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:29.671]  That whole thing is so ridiculous.
[01:57:29.671 --> 01:57:31.392]  It's not even... It's funny.
[01:57:31.392 --> 01:57:33.992]  It's not even... Stephen, the third hour is about to start.
[01:57:33.992 --> 01:57:37.093]  Any other points you want to add, or you ready to go?
[01:57:37.093 --> 01:57:37.653]  No, I'm good.
[01:57:37.653 --> 01:57:39.093]  That's all I want to... God bless you, Steve.
[01:57:39.093 --> 01:57:39.673]  Great points.
[01:57:39.673 --> 01:57:40.434]  All right.
[01:57:40.434 --> 01:57:43.634]  Jeff, Devin, T-Man, and others, your calls straight ahead.
[01:57:43.634 --> 01:57:44.355]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:44.355 --> 01:57:45.755]  Whatever you do, spread those live links.
[01:57:47.239 --> 01:57:55.643]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.643 --> 01:57:57.104]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.104 --> 01:58:01.806]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.806 --> 01:58:04.868]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[01:58:05.368 --> 01:58:07.030]  I still have that energy.
[01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:27.191]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.691 --> 01:58:31.694]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[01:58:31.694 --> 01:58:35.356]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[01:58:35.356 --> 01:58:40.360]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:43.082]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:58:43.082 --> 01:58:45.524]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:48.018 --> 01:58:53.345]  They now know that InfoWars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[01:58:53.345 --> 01:58:55.428]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[01:58:55.428 --> 01:59:01.557]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[01:59:01.557 --> 01:59:02.458]  Come to their door.
[01:59:02.458 --> 01:59:03.279]  I'm death.
[01:59:03.279 --> 01:59:03.940]  And they know it.
[01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:05.102]  I'm death of their system.
[01:59:05.202 --> 01:59:20.525]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast, we'll be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products and we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history and it has got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products and we are hurting.
[01:59:20.725 --> 01:59:21.225]  I think so.
[01:59:50.706 --> 02:00:04.235]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.235 --> 02:00:07.458]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[02:00:07.458 --> 02:00:09.639]  Oh, I love Keith Whitley.
[02:00:09.639 --> 02:00:11.340]  I'm a friend of thunder and lightning.
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:13.322]  Let's listen to a little bit of this, then go right back to the calls.
[02:00:13.322 --> 02:00:17.364]  They wonder if lightning strikes me.
[02:00:17.364 --> 02:00:18.085]  Best line right here.
[02:00:22.901 --> 02:00:30.363]  That's such a good point when the devil gives up on you.
[02:00:30.363 --> 02:00:32.183]  You can feel it.
[02:00:32.183 --> 02:00:38.985]  Look at that 1980's Eric.
[02:00:38.985 --> 02:00:40.746]  Actually George Strait was a big fan of.
[02:00:40.746 --> 02:00:42.226]  Drank himself to death.
[02:00:42.226 --> 02:00:43.627]  Alright, enough of Keith Whitley.
[02:00:43.627 --> 02:00:44.267]  Good stuff though.
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:51.503]  You know, I don't get up here and say positive news if I don't think things are positive.
[02:00:51.503 --> 02:00:54.045]  I'm not one of these globalist cheerleaders.
[02:00:54.045 --> 02:00:57.467]  In fact, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, I got accused of being gloom and doom and negative.
[02:00:57.467 --> 02:01:07.253]  Well, I was believing in you that if bad things were happening, and I told you they were happening, and you checked it out and found out they were, that you're like me, you'd want to do something about it.
[02:01:07.253 --> 02:01:07.893]  And that's the case.
[02:01:07.893 --> 02:01:08.293]  You have.
[02:01:08.293 --> 02:01:11.775]  I bet on you because I bet on me.
[02:01:11.775 --> 02:01:12.516]  I believe in myself.
[02:01:12.516 --> 02:01:13.036]  I believe in you.
[02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:29.681]  But I gotta tell you, no one is buying these hoax pipe bombs, and it just shows the desperation, and it just shows the craziness of these people, just like the old Kavanaugh fakeness.
[02:01:29.681 --> 02:01:32.364]  He's raping women on boats, and in Colorado, none of it's true.
[02:01:32.364 --> 02:01:37.467]  Now, criminal investigation from the Senate to the Justice Department on
[02:01:38.467 --> 02:01:48.538]  Horseface's lawyer and the other woman whose family and everybody else said, you know, she's really bad news and there's restraining orders, the rest of it, and that they made false statements.
[02:01:48.538 --> 02:01:49.980]  That means they've lined it up and proven it.
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:56.447]  So we're not out of the woods, but we're awake now and fighting so things are better.
[02:01:56.447 --> 02:01:57.048]  That's it.
[02:01:57.048 --> 02:01:57.849]  Resistance is victory.
[02:01:59.406 --> 02:02:01.367]  So let's go back to these great callers.
[02:02:01.367 --> 02:02:04.768]  Jeff and Devin and Steve and Riley and Steve and T-Man.
[02:02:04.768 --> 02:02:09.350]  We're talking to folks that are former military, current military, current law enforcement, former EOD.
[02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:11.991]  That's Ordinance Handling and Disposal.
[02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:16.412]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:02:16.412 --> 02:02:17.292]  Jeff in Indiana.
[02:02:17.292 --> 02:02:18.333]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:02:18.333 --> 02:02:18.993]  Thanks for calling.
[02:02:18.993 --> 02:02:20.454]  Go ahead.
[02:02:20.454 --> 02:02:20.754]  Hello.
[02:02:20.754 --> 02:02:22.935]  How you doing today, Alex?
[02:02:22.935 --> 02:02:26.716]  I mean, I'm getting blamed for these fake bombs, but other than that, I'm doing all right.
[02:02:27.970 --> 02:02:34.073]  If it wasn't for the seriousness of these bombs, it would almost be comical, you know?
[02:02:34.073 --> 02:02:35.253]  Yes.
[02:02:35.253 --> 02:02:36.534]  It's pretty disgusting.
[02:02:36.534 --> 02:02:43.377]  But we've got to remember, though, October 31st, that's when the demonic Democrats, their holiday's coming up.
[02:02:43.377 --> 02:02:46.098]  Will they pull a real flag this time?
[02:02:46.098 --> 02:02:47.219]  Hopefully not, you know.
[02:02:47.219 --> 02:02:50.220]  It's kind of, hopefully we'll... Well, exactly.
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:52.621]  My gut tells me we're not out of the woods with 12 days left.
[02:02:52.621 --> 02:02:54.162]  I think they're going to pull some serious crap.
[02:02:55.751 --> 02:03:00.394]  Yeah, those bombs, if it wasn't such a serious thing, they're almost laughable.
[02:03:00.394 --> 02:03:02.215]  It's unreal, you know?
[02:03:02.215 --> 02:03:12.142]  I've been calling around to my local politicians, and they believe the same thing, that these bombs are totally fake, and it's pretty bad here.
[02:03:12.142 --> 02:03:13.383]  Well, that's what I'm hearing from everybody.
[02:03:13.383 --> 02:03:14.844]  I mean, no one is buying this.
[02:03:14.844 --> 02:03:22.809]  I mean, it's not just Lou Dobbs and former Deputy FBI Directors and bomb disposal experts on CNN, MSNBC, NBC.
[02:03:22.809 --> 02:03:24.651]  They're all saying this is ridiculous.
[02:03:25.697 --> 02:03:36.023]  But again, maybe this isn't ham-fisted, maybe we make fun of this, because that just identifies Democrats as victims, and then the big attack comes.
[02:03:36.023 --> 02:03:40.065]  I don't know, but I'm certainly paying attention.
[02:03:40.065 --> 02:03:41.706]  Right, same with me here.
[02:03:41.706 --> 02:03:44.667]  One more thing about the southern border.
[02:03:44.667 --> 02:03:55.073]  General Maddox put down troops at the border, but I've been calling all around again for my politicians, and why not put a strategic FOB, if you will, Forward Operating Base
[02:03:55.635 --> 02:04:07.805]  About three, four hundred miles inside of Mexico to do triage to these people to get them back, you know, either to their countries or actually give them a golden ticket to come to America, you know?
[02:04:07.805 --> 02:04:08.946]  Well, that's a great point.
[02:04:08.946 --> 02:04:13.410]  Yeah, like, oh, you claim you're great, you got a degree, you're not a criminal, whatever, you really are a political dissident.
[02:04:13.410 --> 02:04:14.051]  Boom.
[02:04:14.051 --> 02:04:18.875]  Yeah, they could set up one of those and the hobbits there at the bases could do that.
[02:04:18.875 --> 02:04:20.076]  But will Mexico allow that?
[02:04:20.076 --> 02:04:23.719]  I think the answer is no, because Mexico's really been involved in all this.
[02:04:24.758 --> 02:04:29.179]  Well, see, Mexico was already invaded by these immigrants going across their borders.
[02:04:29.179 --> 02:04:31.820]  We are just doing it for humanitarian reasons.
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:33.001]  Well, I totally agree.
[02:04:33.001 --> 02:04:33.841]  No, no, you're right.
[02:04:33.841 --> 02:04:42.304]  When they allowed that invasion force to pour across as the vanguard for all the others behind it, they opened the gate for our national security to go in there and clean up house.
[02:04:42.304 --> 02:04:45.625]  And it won't be the first time we've marched into Mexico City.
[02:04:45.625 --> 02:04:48.266]  And if the Mexican military wants a fight, they're going to get one.
[02:04:48.266 --> 02:04:49.646]  But I don't want to go to that point.
[02:04:49.646 --> 02:04:51.147]  But this is a real war.
[02:04:51.147 --> 02:04:52.307]  This is strategic.
[02:04:52.307 --> 02:04:54.108]  And if Trump calls for it, I back it.
[02:04:56.277 --> 02:05:03.744]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.

[02:05:13.012 --> 02:05:22.081]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as Acetazanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[02:05:23.015 --> 02:05:34.464]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.

[02:05:44.032 --> 02:05:46.754]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[02:05:46.754 --> 02:05:50.437]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:05:50.437 --> 02:05:52.578]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:06:17.455 --> 02:06:21.677]  Well days, my friends!
[02:06:46.997 --> 02:06:54.821]  Well, Dave, it's on now.
[02:06:54.821 --> 02:06:57.722]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:06:57.722 --> 02:06:58.963]  You're a white male!
[02:06:58.963 --> 02:07:04.225]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:07:04.225 --> 02:07:05.446]  Move, bitch!
[02:07:05.446 --> 02:07:06.326]  Get out the way!
[02:07:13.728 --> 02:07:14.789]  The American plan!
[02:07:14.789 --> 02:07:18.832]  InfoWars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[02:07:18.832 --> 02:07:22.414]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[02:07:22.414 --> 02:07:23.875]  I will not let you down.
[02:07:23.875 --> 02:07:26.477]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:07:26.477 --> 02:07:28.539]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[02:07:28.539 --> 02:07:30.720]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:36.624]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[02:07:36.624 --> 02:07:38.966]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:07:38.966 --> 02:07:39.967]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:07:41.579 --> 02:07:49.321]  Okay, so we've got former assistant deputy directors of the FBI on Fox News, CNN saying it's fake bombs, not even real.
[02:07:49.321 --> 02:07:56.042]  You've got all these EOD experts, even on CNN, saying it's all fake.
[02:07:56.042 --> 02:08:05.724]  And of course you've got the Democrats being mailed these bombs, and it's not gone to the Postal Service, and people are saying this is a way to just get attention, this is a way to make yourself look like a victim.
[02:08:07.441 --> 02:08:08.301]  And I've questioned it.
[02:08:08.301 --> 02:08:09.562]  I've said, wow, look at the timing.
[02:08:09.562 --> 02:08:11.262]  You say that I'm calling for violence.
[02:08:11.262 --> 02:08:12.843]  Trump's calling for violence.
[02:08:12.843 --> 02:08:15.883]  You don't have any examples of that, but the left is really calling for violence.
[02:08:15.883 --> 02:08:21.965]  A New York Times article out today about fantasizing about the assassination of Trump.
[02:08:21.965 --> 02:08:27.887]  Rosie O'Donnell says, uh, martial law, use the military to kill the president.
[02:08:27.887 --> 02:08:31.288]  Phil Mudd says it on CNN, former deputy director of the CIA.
[02:08:34.110 --> 02:08:36.391]  I mean, these people get mailed these devices.
[02:08:36.391 --> 02:08:38.672]  It turns out they're fake devices.
[02:08:38.672 --> 02:08:42.093]  And it's all over the news that, oh my God, Trump's got to be impeached.
[02:08:42.093 --> 02:08:44.534]  You know, his hateful rhetoric's causing it.
[02:08:44.534 --> 02:08:52.838]  Anybody could mail themselves something, or have it delivered, and then say they're a victim.
[02:08:52.838 --> 02:08:54.359]  And it starts in the hierarchy of the Democrats.
[02:08:54.359 --> 02:08:57.040]  George Soros, the Clintons, Obama, right down.
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:58.961]  I mean, take this package that got mailed to me today.
[02:08:58.961 --> 02:09:01.082]  Dr. McCampshaw, please.
[02:09:01.082 --> 02:09:01.622]  I mean, right here.
[02:09:02.745 --> 02:09:03.245]  What is this?
[02:09:03.245 --> 02:09:04.487]  They were telling me.
[02:09:04.487 --> 02:09:05.928]  I mean, did a Democrat mail this to me?
[02:09:05.928 --> 02:09:09.131]  Because it says Alex Jones.
[02:09:09.131 --> 02:09:14.295]  Hillary Clinton, 50 Dark Heart Lane, Columbus, California, 90666.
[02:09:14.295 --> 02:09:17.498]  How in the hell do they have our real address?
[02:09:17.498 --> 02:09:20.421]  Gosh, that even looks more real than what they mailed.
[02:09:20.421 --> 02:09:21.482]  And of course, just like CNN did.
[02:09:21.482 --> 02:09:23.123]  We're not going to treat this like it's a real bomb.
[02:09:23.123 --> 02:09:24.784]  Let's just get right in here.
[02:09:24.784 --> 02:09:26.646]  Wow, that looks a lot more real.
[02:09:26.646 --> 02:09:28.788]  Whoa, Hillary's face is on it.
[02:09:28.788 --> 02:09:29.669]  That means she sent it.
[02:09:31.036 --> 02:09:33.799]  They put right-wing stuff on there, whatever that means, the right-wing Senate.
[02:09:33.799 --> 02:09:36.542]  Hillary sent this, her picture's on it.
[02:09:36.542 --> 02:09:37.743]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:09:37.743 --> 02:09:38.424]  It's ticking.
[02:09:38.424 --> 02:09:40.626]  Actually, I got another package that was just sent to you.
[02:09:40.626 --> 02:09:48.874]  This was just dropped off by a Mr. Hodgkinson, or something, Mr. Hodgkinson, I don't know, he said he just got released from a penitentiary, but yeah, so Alex.
[02:09:48.874 --> 02:09:49.595]  Hey, did you hear?
[02:09:49.595 --> 02:09:54.180]  A creepy porn lawyer and one of the accusers of Kavanaugh is under criminal investigation for indictment.
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:55.060]  Oh, really?
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:57.902]  Well, maybe he sent that, then, to distract from that, maybe.
[02:09:57.902 --> 02:09:58.723]  Oh, no, no.
[02:09:58.723 --> 02:10:02.885]  No one would ever send something to their political enemy, or send it to themselves, to then be the victim.
[02:10:02.885 --> 02:10:04.266]  Wait, is that a Hillary Clinton head on there?
[02:10:04.266 --> 02:10:04.926]  She did it!
[02:10:04.926 --> 02:10:05.887]  Then it's obviously her.
[02:10:05.887 --> 02:10:06.967]  We're anti-Hillary.
[02:10:06.967 --> 02:10:08.088]  We're right-wing Christians.
[02:10:08.088 --> 02:10:08.588]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:10:08.588 --> 02:10:11.150]  Clearly, Democrats just sent me this bomb.
[02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:13.691]  They just dynamite.
[02:10:13.691 --> 02:10:15.752]  Twin dynamites here in Austin.
[02:10:15.752 --> 02:10:16.913]  We've been sent dynamite.
[02:10:16.913 --> 02:10:17.593]  Hold on Alex, hold on.
[02:10:17.593 --> 02:10:18.154]  No, no.
[02:10:18.154 --> 02:10:20.255]  In fact, whoever sent this is a bomber.
[02:10:20.255 --> 02:10:21.396]  Doesn't matter it's fake.
[02:10:21.396 --> 02:10:22.636]  Doesn't matter it's satire.
[02:10:22.636 --> 02:10:24.898]  Doesn't matter it didn't really happen.
[02:10:24.898 --> 02:10:25.858]  The clock is ticking.
[02:10:25.858 --> 02:10:26.699]  There's a clock.
[02:10:26.699 --> 02:10:28.520]  Hillary's picture's on it.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:29.460]  These aren't road flares.
[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:31.922]  These are TNT dynamite.
[02:10:31.922 --> 02:10:32.742]  This is a bomber.
[02:10:32.742 --> 02:10:34.643]  A major bombing attack.
[02:10:34.643 --> 02:10:35.204]  Alex, I got a box here.
[02:10:35.204 --> 02:10:36.584]  Because they're calling it a bombing.
[02:10:36.584 --> 02:10:36.865]  Hold on.
[02:10:36.865 --> 02:10:38.065]  Be quiet, dude.
[02:10:38.065 --> 02:10:38.906]  This is serious.
[02:10:38.906 --> 02:10:40.407]  They're calling it a bombing.
[02:10:41.207 --> 02:10:44.251]  They're calling it a bombing that people got mailed fake bombs.
[02:10:44.251 --> 02:10:45.813]  So this is a bombing too.
[02:10:45.813 --> 02:10:48.356]  Hillary Clinton tried to bomb Infowars.
[02:10:48.356 --> 02:10:49.477]  Sorry, dude, go ahead.
[02:10:49.477 --> 02:10:52.801]  Well, I got this box here and it's from Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[02:10:53.755 --> 02:10:55.076]  From Fraud Florida?
[02:10:55.076 --> 02:10:56.536]  Well, we're going to open that in a moment.
[02:10:56.536 --> 02:10:57.797]  Let me open this one first.
[02:10:57.797 --> 02:10:59.917]  Okay, Owen, you were sent this to Alex Jones.
[02:10:59.917 --> 02:11:00.598]  Hold on, Alex.
[02:11:00.598 --> 02:11:06.040]  Look at what the... This is to Alex Jones, but from Soros Headquarters.
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:06.620]  Alex, read that.
[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:07.400]  What is that?
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:11.602]  Soros Headquarters, 666 Hill Highway, Baphomet, New York.
[02:11:11.602 --> 02:11:12.582]  Oh my gosh, and look at this.
[02:11:12.582 --> 02:11:14.283]  This actually came in the priority mail.
[02:11:14.283 --> 02:11:16.324]  This is an official priority mail box.
[02:11:16.324 --> 02:11:17.824]  Clearly official.
[02:11:17.824 --> 02:11:19.625]  I mean, look at how... I mean, Alex...
[02:11:20.385 --> 02:11:21.465]  This is amazing.
[02:11:21.465 --> 02:11:22.946]  This was just dropped off by the mail.
[02:11:22.946 --> 02:11:24.607]  George Soros sent me a bomb.
[02:11:24.607 --> 02:11:26.087]  This was just dropped off by the mail.
[02:11:26.087 --> 02:11:26.827]  Let's look in it Alex.
[02:11:26.827 --> 02:11:27.828]  Or somebody in his house did.
[02:11:27.828 --> 02:11:28.348]  I don't know.
[02:11:28.348 --> 02:11:31.889]  This just got dropped off by the mail.
[02:11:31.889 --> 02:11:32.830]  Oh my gosh.
[02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:33.590]  Oh another bomb?
[02:11:33.590 --> 02:11:34.210]  Oh my gosh.
[02:11:34.210 --> 02:11:37.591]  And look, it's got a microchip on it.
[02:11:37.591 --> 02:11:38.972]  It's got some circuitry.
[02:11:38.972 --> 02:11:40.072]  It's counting down here.
[02:11:40.072 --> 02:11:41.273]  What's this bomb?
[02:11:41.273 --> 02:11:42.613]  It even says bomb!
[02:11:42.613 --> 02:11:43.613]  Oh no!
[02:11:43.613 --> 02:11:44.474]  It says bomb on it!
[02:11:44.474 --> 02:11:45.194]  George Soros is on it!
[02:11:48.175 --> 02:11:49.395]  Oh my God!
[02:11:49.395 --> 02:11:50.876]  Oh George Soros, it's his fault!
[02:11:50.876 --> 02:11:51.996]  Is it about to go off?
[02:11:51.996 --> 02:11:53.457]  Hold on, what's going on here?
[02:11:53.457 --> 02:11:54.297]  Get down!
[02:11:54.297 --> 02:11:56.977]  You know, you know, hold on.
[02:11:56.977 --> 02:12:04.199]  Sorry, I thought... Listen, we joke about this, but this is what they're saying, that I'm guilty, Trump's guilty, we're all guilty, he's a fake mom, so these are real too.
[02:12:04.199 --> 02:12:07.140]  We got Hillary Meldous a mom, because there are pictures on it.
[02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:08.181]  Uh, mine's ticking.
[02:12:08.181 --> 02:12:10.041]  Dr. McKim, shot please.
[02:12:10.041 --> 02:12:11.061]  Yours is ticking as well?
[02:12:11.061 --> 02:12:11.622]  It's ticking.
[02:12:11.622 --> 02:12:13.002]  This one says bomb, what does that mean?
[02:12:14.864 --> 02:12:18.406]  Okay, dude, let's go back to Rob Duke, our News Director at InfoWars and NewsWars.com.
[02:12:18.406 --> 02:12:18.946]  Tell me what you got.
[02:12:18.946 --> 02:12:20.107]  There's another Priority Mail box.
[02:12:20.107 --> 02:12:24.570]  Priority Mail, Debbie Wasserman Schultz return address, which, you know, and I open it up.
[02:12:24.570 --> 02:12:26.251]  Why don't you come on in here, Owen, stay with us.
[02:12:26.251 --> 02:12:27.491]  Come on in here where we have the mic.
[02:12:27.491 --> 02:12:28.632]  I want to show this in the studio.
[02:12:28.632 --> 02:12:30.573]  Oh, it's another bomb.
[02:12:30.573 --> 02:12:32.114]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz sent you a bomb.
[02:12:32.114 --> 02:12:33.395]  It's got her face on it.
[02:12:33.395 --> 02:12:34.195]  She looks a little cross-eyed.
[02:12:34.195 --> 02:12:35.616]  Hold on, we got a broadcast from the road.
[02:12:35.616 --> 02:12:37.077]  Everybody get out of the office!
[02:12:37.077 --> 02:12:38.178]  Everybody get out of the office!
[02:12:39.278 --> 02:12:40.099]  Folks, we have that.
[02:12:40.099 --> 02:12:41.300]  No, seriously, Rob, come on in here.
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:41.760]  You know what?
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:43.521]  Oh, it says there's five minutes until it detonates.
[02:12:43.521 --> 02:12:44.202]  It's all right.
[02:12:44.202 --> 02:12:46.604]  Come on in here with Owen and share my experience.
[02:12:46.604 --> 02:12:47.925]  Because I want to be like Mr. Baker.
[02:12:47.925 --> 02:12:48.885]  Now, let's show all these.
[02:12:48.885 --> 02:12:51.788]  My God, this is national news, not a hoax or anything.
[02:12:51.788 --> 02:12:54.650]  You know, just an innocent gopher, nothing to worry about.
[02:12:54.650 --> 02:12:56.031]  Let me just show you this.
[02:12:56.031 --> 02:12:58.653]  Oh, my God, it's Debbie Wasserman Schultz, cross-eyed.
[02:12:58.653 --> 02:13:00.474]  Well, that's definitely her.
[02:13:00.474 --> 02:13:01.976]  That's a real picture of her.
[02:13:01.976 --> 02:13:03.177]  So that's left wing.
[02:13:04.278 --> 02:13:09.322]  Folks, this is the rhetoric of Soros and Schultz and Hillary, you know, saying we're all evil and fake news.
[02:13:09.322 --> 02:13:15.326]  This caused someone who's their supporter to send us these bombs that are set to detonate.
[02:13:15.326 --> 02:13:18.168]  This one's set to detonate at 5.10 today.
[02:13:18.168 --> 02:13:20.670]  This one's set to detonate in about 30 seconds.
[02:13:20.670 --> 02:13:22.191]  This one's set... this just says bomb.
[02:13:22.679 --> 02:13:26.842]  No, Alex, I'm willing to report, at least, I'm willing to report it.
[02:13:26.842 --> 02:13:37.230]  I have no evidence, but I'm willing to report that it was actually someone that was on the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate list this morning doing research that read that Infowars is the bad guy, so they came and dropped off these.
[02:13:37.230 --> 02:13:38.732]  These are clear bombs.
[02:13:38.732 --> 02:13:40.653]  I mean, just look at this.
[02:13:40.653 --> 02:13:42.134]  High circuitry here.
[02:13:42.134 --> 02:13:43.295]  Very complex.
[02:13:43.295 --> 02:13:44.656]  I mean, this is not the work of an expert.
[02:13:44.656 --> 02:13:51.301]  It'll take weeks until after the election to figure out what Democrat sent us this, but we've got clues here.
[02:13:51.301 --> 02:13:51.922]  Those look deadly.
[02:13:52.506 --> 02:13:58.091]  I mean, if you look at this, this is clearly like, I mean, somebody very sophisticated did that.
[02:13:58.091 --> 02:13:58.971]  She is beautiful, though.
[02:13:58.971 --> 02:14:01.634]  I mean, if the face blew off that, that's a paper cut right there.
[02:14:03.544 --> 02:14:05.645]  Well, these are actually much more dangerous than road flares.
[02:14:05.645 --> 02:14:06.986]  You could actually burn a building down.
[02:14:06.986 --> 02:14:07.687]  The others were inert.
[02:14:07.687 --> 02:14:08.828]  They admit they're fake.
[02:14:08.828 --> 02:14:09.668]  And of course, this is satire.
[02:14:09.668 --> 02:14:20.836]  I'm going to come back with all the serious former Navy bombing expert, Air Force civil engineer bombing topic, marine bombing topic, law enforcement, police officers next, Devin, and then Curtis and Team Man.
[02:14:20.836 --> 02:14:25.999]  We're going to get to all of you before former head of CIA psychological operations, seriously, Steve Patrick joins us.
[02:14:25.999 --> 02:14:28.841]  But this has been satire before they said we put out a fake bomb hoax.
[02:14:28.841 --> 02:14:31.343]  No, it's the Democrats that have been caught that did that.
[02:14:32.003 --> 02:14:41.014]  And, uh, they're the ones, and we're just illustrating, how anybody could just deliver crap like this, and then say it's real, but all the experts say it's not, and they're still breathlessly doing this.
[02:14:41.014 --> 02:14:42.115]  This is their false flag.
[02:14:42.115 --> 02:14:43.076]  This is ridiculous.
[02:14:43.076 --> 02:14:43.797]  Oh, these aren't real?
[02:14:43.797 --> 02:14:45.459]  These aren't real?
[02:14:45.459 --> 02:14:46.079]  No, no.
[02:14:46.079 --> 02:14:47.321]  No, this is a bombing.
[02:14:47.321 --> 02:14:48.302]  Didn't you see CNN?
[02:14:48.302 --> 02:14:50.344]  Yeah, just a... Exactly, a bombing happened.
[02:14:50.344 --> 02:14:51.706]  Nobody's been... No, this is a bombing.
[02:14:52.509 --> 02:14:57.711]  And why don't we, we should be like Jayco on CNN when he said he was in the Gulf War getting bombed.
[02:14:57.711 --> 02:14:58.491]  He wasn't.
[02:14:58.491 --> 02:14:59.571]  Or the babies in incubators.
[02:15:09.754 --> 02:15:11.395]  Alright, alright, stop it guys.
[02:15:11.395 --> 02:15:13.597]  This was all satire before they said we're serious.
[02:15:13.597 --> 02:15:15.478]  Just like Hillary's ever gonna really be president.
[02:15:15.478 --> 02:15:16.398]  That's meant for you.
[02:15:16.398 --> 02:15:19.500]  I gotta get serious with these EOD people, who I appreciate holding.
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:22.342]  It was my idea to do this this morning, but it's... Good job, gentlemen.
[02:15:22.342 --> 02:15:25.604]  That was satire to illustrate, why are we listening to these liars' crap?
[02:15:25.604 --> 02:15:31.388]  They're known liars, they stand to gain, the bombs are fake, this is absolute horse manure, and this is what they come up with now?
[02:15:32.108 --> 02:15:33.969]  I mean, this is like Keystone Cop crap.
[02:15:33.969 --> 02:15:34.830]  Okay.
[02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:38.552]  Laurel and Hardy are now running the Democratic Party and no one's buying it.
[02:15:38.552 --> 02:15:39.692]  Because America's awake.
[02:15:39.692 --> 02:15:41.213]  You thought you'd intimidate us.
[02:15:41.213 --> 02:15:42.354]  No, we were asleep.
[02:15:42.354 --> 02:15:43.655]  All you did was wake us up.

[02:19:59.669 --> 02:20:02.260]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.941 --> 02:20:19.624]  Folks, you'll see the fake media come out and say that we seriously called it a fake bomb threat on ourselves.
[02:20:19.624 --> 02:20:22.586]  No, that's what the Democrats, all evidence points towards, have done.
[02:20:22.586 --> 02:20:24.187]  We're not saying that on your screen.
[02:20:24.187 --> 02:20:29.650]  The fourth bomb that was delivered here, it's a apple bomb, from George Soros, is real.
[02:20:29.650 --> 02:20:31.351]  I mean, it really is some wires and an apple and...
[02:20:33.063 --> 02:20:34.984]  Yes sir, thank you very much for having me on Alex.
[02:21:03.752 --> 02:21:10.215]  You know, um, I'm, I'm kind of like you sometimes where there's just so many different avenues you can take this.
[02:21:10.215 --> 02:21:12.356]  So I had to kind of focus my thinking.
[02:21:12.356 --> 02:21:30.084]  And, uh, from an investigator standpoint, um, thinking about the bombs themselves, it's just ridiculous that the bombs are so poorly made and, uh, they were sent to so many different people getting into the psychology of whoever sent them.
[02:21:30.084 --> 02:21:31.165]  It just,
[02:21:32.205 --> 02:21:36.267]  Prima facie, to me, it's pretty obvious.
[02:21:36.267 --> 02:21:37.308]  And explain that!
[02:21:37.308 --> 02:21:43.351]  Who benefits is almost always the key, and then you check it out and it leads down that, and that's where you're at.
[02:21:43.351 --> 02:21:57.038]  Key Bono, who benefits, who has the motive, who has the history, who's pre-hyping their victims while they're calling for violence, and then it's dud bombs, none of them go off, all the experts say they look like they're fake, and then they're grandstanding about it 12 days from an election.
[02:21:57.935 --> 02:22:08.687]  So if I had to take a guess, you know, my best educated guess, you know, it just looks like it benefits Democrats and they can gather sympathy from this.
[02:22:08.687 --> 02:22:12.911]  They can make themselves look like victims and they can get a lot out of this.
[02:22:12.911 --> 02:22:14.233]  I don't think people realize how
[02:22:15.093 --> 02:22:18.895]  The tool that this can be for them moving forward.
[02:22:18.895 --> 02:22:29.319]  And what I really wanted to tell you about Alex, this is the second part of my thinking and I think you'll really find this interesting if you haven't already maybe thought about this yourself.
[02:22:29.319 --> 02:22:31.680]  You see, I'm from Missouri.
[02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:34.841]  The second thing that really, this dawned on me a couple days ago.
[02:22:34.841 --> 02:22:41.324]  I was thinking about the, you know, how you're being demonized, InfoWars, Patriots in general.
[02:22:41.324 --> 02:22:44.225]  I thought about the MIAC report.
[02:22:45.503 --> 02:22:46.423]  You remember that?
[02:22:46.423 --> 02:22:52.284]  Oh, that we got from federal marshals that literally was teaching them that veterans are the number one enemy.
[02:22:52.284 --> 02:22:55.965]  They said there will be IEDs, we're going to have a war with the militia.
[02:22:55.965 --> 02:22:59.006]  And they were saying radical Islam doesn't exist.
[02:22:59.006 --> 02:23:00.486]  It's all Christians.
[02:23:00.486 --> 02:23:03.107]  And veterans were the number one enemy.
[02:23:03.107 --> 02:23:10.108]  They were telling us police officers, you know, here in Missouri that, you know, Ron Paul stickers that, you know, target these people.
[02:23:10.108 --> 02:23:10.848]  And we were like, what?
[02:23:10.848 --> 02:23:14.569]  They were saying, Ron Paul, get out of the Fed stickers are a code to kill cops.
[02:23:15.492 --> 02:23:16.333]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:16.333 --> 02:23:22.363]  And until this day, there is still some sense of that out there for some officers.
[02:23:24.056 --> 02:23:31.243]  It's just ridiculous, but that was one of the first things that popped into my head, and then you mention all the time things like the Oklahoma City bombing, and it all ties in.
[02:23:31.243 --> 02:23:33.185]  This has been going on for a very long time.
[02:23:33.185 --> 02:23:42.735]  Oh, this is a leftist narrative to frame Americans as terrorists when the right-wing terrorists don't exist other than McVeigh, and that was fake!
[02:23:42.735 --> 02:23:44.036]  And it's the left.
[02:23:44.036 --> 02:23:47.340]  I mean, Obama sat at the feet of the Weathermen.
[02:23:50.465 --> 02:23:51.687]  They have the history.
[02:23:51.687 --> 02:23:55.152]  Previous activity is the greatest indicator of what?
[02:23:55.152 --> 02:23:57.435]  Future behavior.
[02:23:57.435 --> 02:23:58.537]  Absolutely, yep.
[02:23:58.537 --> 02:24:01.001]  And that's the psychology we're dealing with.
[02:24:02.512 --> 02:24:05.153]  Yeah, I see you got the MIAC report pulled up.
[02:24:05.153 --> 02:24:11.477]  And like I said, just being from Missouri, that's something that kind of hit home for me personally, but it should.
[02:24:11.477 --> 02:24:13.638]  Well, by the way, it was going out to everybody.
[02:24:13.638 --> 02:24:19.501]  It was just Missouri got its version written by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL, so you guys got it out to us.
[02:24:19.501 --> 02:24:20.582]  Well, God bless you, Devin.
[02:24:20.582 --> 02:24:21.242]  Amazing points.
[02:24:21.242 --> 02:24:22.823]  Anything else?
[02:24:22.823 --> 02:24:23.303]  No, no.
[02:24:23.303 --> 02:24:27.326]  Just want to say thank you very much for having me on, and God bless you guys.
[02:24:27.326 --> 02:24:27.866]  God bless you.
[02:24:30.501 --> 02:24:31.862]  Absolutely.
[02:24:31.862 --> 02:24:33.443]  Don't thank me, I thank you.
[02:24:33.443 --> 02:24:41.146]  You know, I used to buy into the anti-cop stuff a little bit, just because I'm a constitutionalist and it could be a danger if they were bad.
[02:24:41.146 --> 02:24:46.029]  And the cops aren't perfect, but on average they're more awake, and the military's more awake than anybody, and that's why the left hates them.
[02:24:46.029 --> 02:24:47.069]  That's why they want to control you.
[02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:51.351]  It's why they hate us.
[02:24:51.351 --> 02:24:53.792]  They just hate this country.
[02:24:53.792 --> 02:25:02.576]  And law enforcement and the military represent the nation, and that's where the power is at the end of the day, and they want to control you.
[02:25:02.576 --> 02:25:06.457]  But their attempt to turn the military against America backfired.
[02:25:06.457 --> 02:25:09.419]  It backfired spectacularly.
[02:25:09.419 --> 02:25:12.400]  Some cops still buy into it, but, you know, that's their problem.
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:14.701]  There's always going to be idiots.
[02:25:14.701 --> 02:25:15.901]  Oh, we got so many good callers here.
[02:25:15.901 --> 02:25:16.842]  He's been holding along us now.
[02:25:19.633 --> 02:25:22.614]  Let's talk about bombings, former Navy.
[02:25:22.614 --> 02:25:27.235]  Steven, you're on the air, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:25:27.235 --> 02:25:27.895]  Yeah, hello.
[02:25:27.895 --> 02:25:33.416]  Hey brother, what do you think about this situation?
[02:25:33.416 --> 02:25:38.878]  Oh man, this is just out of the playbook, you know?
[02:25:38.878 --> 02:25:43.619]  It's something that, I think we've seen this in the past.
[02:25:43.619 --> 02:25:46.539]  And I tell you, amigo, this is something else.
[02:25:49.332 --> 02:25:56.666]  Those bombs, they look like toys that you can purchase at the Walmart or something.
[02:25:56.666 --> 02:26:00.694]  Except for the one with the picture on it and the writing on it.
[02:26:01.823 --> 02:26:05.186]  You know, that had to be... Oh yeah, a bomb's gonna blow up.
[02:26:05.186 --> 02:26:07.247]  You don't put writing on it to frame people.
[02:26:07.247 --> 02:26:10.109]  But again, if you put Hillary's picture on a bomb, she must be behind it.
[02:26:10.109 --> 02:26:14.353]  We could mail ourselves fake bombs and then say Hillary did it with the same amount of credibility.
[02:26:14.353 --> 02:26:16.014]  The cops would be here in ten minutes to arrest us.
[02:26:16.014 --> 02:26:17.315]  They would see right through it.
[02:26:17.315 --> 02:26:22.499]  The bomb that was removed from the building right by here was a serious bomb.
[02:26:22.499 --> 02:26:24.981]  No, this is the real thing, said de Blasio.
[02:26:24.981 --> 02:26:30.465]  Again, when people start saying, out of the blue, without being questioned, this is real, this is real, what does that tell you?
[02:26:32.561 --> 02:26:39.406]  Oh man, that just tells me that there's a bigger thing behind it.
[02:26:39.406 --> 02:26:39.886]  Exactly.
[02:26:39.886 --> 02:26:47.991]  If you walked on a car lot that you think is a new car lot, and let's say you were buying a Ford Explorer, and you walk in and the guy goes, this is a Ford Explorer.
[02:26:47.991 --> 02:26:49.152]  It's new.
[02:26:49.152 --> 02:26:50.773]  It's new, but I can give you a discount.
[02:26:50.773 --> 02:26:56.617]  You'd start thinking, that's a car that's already been wrecked or something, and you'd do a search and find out he was lying.
[02:26:56.617 --> 02:26:57.277]  See?
[02:26:57.277 --> 02:27:00.079]  At a new car lot, they wouldn't say, oh by the way, this is new, would they?
[02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:02.671]  Right.
[02:27:02.671 --> 02:27:06.133]  They wouldn't say, oh, by the way, this is a real bomb.
[02:27:06.133 --> 02:27:08.094]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:27:08.094 --> 02:27:21.101]  Yeah, you know, and I don't know if you were like this as a kid, but, you know, we used to blow up a lot of M-80s and stuff, and man, those would do a lot more damage than what these so-called bombs are capable of.
[02:27:21.101 --> 02:27:23.062]  Oh, let me tell you, that was about 10 years ago.
[02:27:23.062 --> 02:27:25.264]  I bought a bunch just for fun.
[02:27:26.064 --> 02:27:33.529]  Yeah, you know, me and my buddies we used to, you know, get like a milk carton or a plastic milk jug and, you know, break some firecrackers and put the
[02:27:56.587 --> 02:27:57.088]  We all did it!
[02:28:12.048 --> 02:28:12.849]  Candy, you know?
[02:28:31.807 --> 02:28:33.468]  And now, look at America.
[02:28:33.468 --> 02:28:36.090]  Back then you took guns to school, kids could have dynamite.
[02:28:36.090 --> 02:28:39.252]  We didn't have bombers back then, because we didn't have communists.
[02:28:39.252 --> 02:28:40.753]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:28:40.753 --> 02:28:41.693]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:28:41.693 --> 02:28:45.956]  From the former head of psychological operations for... Somebody's joining us.
[02:28:55.245 --> 02:29:00.028]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[02:29:00.028 --> 02:29:05.912]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[02:29:05.912 --> 02:29:12.416]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[02:29:12.416 --> 02:29:16.459]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[02:29:22.723 --> 02:29:24.464]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[02:29:25.044 --> 02:29:31.385]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:29:31.385 --> 02:29:34.426]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:29:34.426 --> 02:29:40.347]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:29:40.347 --> 02:29:44.148]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:29:44.148 --> 02:29:45.408]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:29:45.408 --> 02:29:46.748]  Who do we fight for?
[02:29:46.748 --> 02:29:52.950]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:54.390]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:29:56.252 --> 02:30:04.656]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:04.656 --> 02:30:06.097]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:06.097 --> 02:30:10.799]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:10.799 --> 02:30:13.881]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:30:14.361 --> 02:30:16.042]  I still have that energy.
[02:30:16.042 --> 02:30:36.193]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:30:36.693 --> 02:30:40.694]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:30:52.098 --> 02:30:54.519]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:56.300 --> 02:31:00.562]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:31:00.562 --> 02:31:04.024]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:31:04.024 --> 02:31:05.805]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:31:05.805 --> 02:31:09.066]  They know we have like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:31:09.066 --> 02:31:15.849]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:31:15.849 --> 02:31:20.932]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:27.378]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:31:27.378 --> 02:31:30.360]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:31:30.360 --> 02:31:31.461]  I want to keep going.
[02:31:31.461 --> 02:31:35.285]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:31:35.285 --> 02:31:37.307]  I want to push all the way.
[02:31:37.307 --> 02:31:38.608]  I've committed to do that.
[02:31:38.608 --> 02:31:39.689]  I've prayed for that.
[02:31:39.689 --> 02:31:41.331]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:31:41.331 --> 02:31:43.773]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:31:44.253 --> 02:31:45.554]  I will never falter.
[02:31:45.554 --> 02:31:47.895]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:31:47.895 --> 02:31:48.835]  I physically will.
[02:31:48.835 --> 02:31:55.579]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then 4Wars4.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:31:59.961 --> 02:32:05.687]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:32:05.687 --> 02:32:13.554]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:32:13.554 --> 02:32:16.717]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:32:16.897 --> 02:32:22.180]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:24.942]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:32:24.942 --> 02:32:33.908]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:32:33.968 --> 02:32:40.231]  It's powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract.
[02:32:40.231 --> 02:32:45.955]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:32:45.955 --> 02:32:50.757]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:50.757 --> 02:32:59.222]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:59.222 --> 02:33:01.863]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.576 --> 02:33:28.821]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:36.941]  Alright, I'm going to host it in the next hour with Roger Stone joining us.
[02:33:36.941 --> 02:33:41.803]  We've got T-Man, Ethan, Curtis, Randy, Greg, Shane, Garrett, Steve, Riley.
[02:33:41.803 --> 02:33:46.524]  And I said, if you're EOD, current, former law enforcement, military, they've all made incredible points.
[02:33:46.524 --> 02:33:52.366]  We'll get to your calls throughout this 30 minutes, and then Dr. Steve Buchenek leaves us into the next hour with Roger.
[02:33:52.366 --> 02:33:55.027]  But this will be the group of calls we can get to because I don't want to leave people holding.
[02:33:55.027 --> 02:33:56.347]  But I promise I'll get to all of you.
[02:33:56.347 --> 02:33:57.087]  I respect your time.
[02:33:57.087 --> 02:33:58.088]  Please stay there.
[02:33:58.088 --> 02:33:58.728]  Please don't forget.
[02:33:59.673 --> 02:34:01.074]  We're kicking the globalist ass.
[02:34:01.074 --> 02:34:03.076]  I just plugged once an hour.
[02:34:03.076 --> 02:34:10.123]  We have free shipping storewide and 50% off all the supplements, 35% off high quality storable foods, other big discounts.
[02:34:10.123 --> 02:34:19.031]  Because they took five of our six payment processors and I had to sell our Christmas specials, our Black Friday specials, our Cyber Monday specials all at once.
[02:34:19.031 --> 02:34:19.891]  We did all the specials.
[02:34:21.897 --> 02:34:26.740]  We've got a backup and another backup, praise God, payment processor.
[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:30.722]  And we had Soros breathing down our neck, huge harassment, I had to file lawsuits over it, you name it.
[02:34:30.722 --> 02:34:32.403]  So it's very expensive.
[02:34:32.403 --> 02:34:36.625]  And at these sales, we're making like 10-15% on some of these products, but boy are we selling a lot of them.
[02:34:37.583 --> 02:34:41.004]  And you can see all the five-star reviews, except for our two new products that haven't got reviews yet.
[02:34:41.004 --> 02:34:46.465]  So, get your X2, the last run of that, because we just can't secure it from the deep-earth crystals anymore.
[02:34:46.465 --> 02:34:50.045]  The Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste with Iodine and Colloidal Silver.
[02:34:50.045 --> 02:34:56.586]  The BrainForce Plus, all of it, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[02:34:56.586 --> 02:35:01.767]  And the fact that they haven't destroyed us, and really, core audience, we've just gotten stronger.
[02:35:01.767 --> 02:35:04.148]  Our outreach has gotten hammered.
[02:35:04.148 --> 02:35:05.768]  And I'm not bragging, you know the good news.
[02:35:05.768 --> 02:35:06.568]  The video's on the site.
[02:35:07.715 --> 02:35:12.457]  I was totally ineffective at the Trump rally, first one I went to, because I was mobbed.
[02:35:12.457 --> 02:35:16.158]  90% of people acted like I was Elvis Presley.
[02:35:16.158 --> 02:35:17.058]  Okay?
[02:35:17.058 --> 02:35:20.600]  And again, that shows we launched the Trump movement.
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:23.401]  Americana's back, no matter what happens to Trump.
[02:35:23.401 --> 02:35:24.241]  So be positive!
[02:35:25.126 --> 02:35:37.114]  That said, though, Dr. Steve Pachinick ran psychological operations for the State Department, another three-letter agency, best-selling author, researcher, co-wrote Tom Clancy's book, stevepachinick.com, and I'm trying to get him to come in studio.
[02:35:37.114 --> 02:35:48.362]  He offered years ago, and then I asked him lately, and he makes little jokes, because we've never met in person, but he's been on air with me for 17 years now, and we've broken hundreds of major stories.
[02:35:48.362 --> 02:35:50.303]  And so, Dr. Steve, good to have you here with us.
[02:35:50.303 --> 02:35:51.424]  I don't know your view yet.
[02:35:51.424 --> 02:35:52.685]  I haven't looked.
[02:35:52.685 --> 02:35:53.746]  What do you make of...
[02:35:55.467 --> 02:35:59.070]  Of these ridiculous pipe bombs?
[02:35:59.070 --> 02:36:11.101]  Well, I don't make anything except whoever thought of it or whoever did it or didn't do it or created it has just backfired an entire system that it's not going to work.
[02:36:11.101 --> 02:36:20.269]  Whatever was intended to do threat or intimidation, all it did was to jack up what we did, what we call our readiness alert.
[02:36:20.269 --> 02:36:21.810]  So the police, the FBI,
[02:36:23.406 --> 02:36:26.189]  Uh, the post office, they're all doing a great job.
[02:36:26.189 --> 02:36:35.217]  And what it's showing to America, quite frankly, on the positive side, is the fact that we do have a national security that is domestic.
[02:36:35.217 --> 02:36:37.218]  It's not only external.
[02:36:37.218 --> 02:36:39.500]  So how Homeland Security is doing well.
[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:41.942]  Miss Nielsen did an excellent job.
[02:36:41.942 --> 02:36:44.204]  The military is doing fine.
[02:36:44.204 --> 02:36:46.947]  General Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, Mattis.
[02:36:47.527 --> 02:36:49.310]  But that is constitutional!
[02:37:04.381 --> 02:37:08.243]  It is constitutional if it's used for support.
[02:37:08.243 --> 02:37:13.966]  And Mattis is a very strict constitutionalist, as is ironically Trump.
[02:37:13.966 --> 02:37:26.532]  And so both individuals understood very clearly we need a support system on the border, behind the great guys in ICE and everybody else who's fighting down there, FBI and all the others.
[02:37:27.112 --> 02:37:48.684]  But quite frankly, it is totally, you know, inappropriate for a group of individuals, no matter where they come from, to come to the United States and expect us to take them in with the nonsensical story that they are refugees or they're in, you know, danger of some type of political or economic disaster.
[02:37:48.684 --> 02:37:52.246]  Now, I'm an example of a Cuban born in Cuba.
[02:37:53.271 --> 02:37:55.173]  Came to the United States.
[02:37:55.173 --> 02:37:56.734]  My father was a physician.
[02:37:56.734 --> 02:38:05.121]  It took us six years to get a visa just to come here so that we could spend one year alone.
[02:38:05.794 --> 02:38:11.095]  So that my father could pass the board exams in order to stay here in the United States.
[02:38:11.095 --> 02:38:19.017]  At the same time, he was drafted into the army, and I was informed that I would be drafted, and I was, and I was happy to serve.
[02:38:19.017 --> 02:38:24.099]  Those are the conditions under which you come to the United States legally.
[02:38:24.099 --> 02:38:25.099]  There is no other approach.
[02:38:25.099 --> 02:38:33.961]  Yeah, you don't message some Soros UN anti-America leftist base, get brainwashed and given money to come in here waving foreign flags and screaming, America's Nazi.
[02:38:35.484 --> 02:38:37.506]  Soros is a buffoon.
[02:38:37.506 --> 02:38:42.929]  You know, the good part he had done in the Soviet Union when he brought in Sakharov.
[02:38:42.929 --> 02:38:44.531]  I give him credit for that.
[02:38:44.531 --> 02:38:47.973]  I was in the Soviet Union when we were working against the Soviets.
[02:38:47.973 --> 02:38:55.718]  He took out dissidents, but eventually became too old, too entitled, too narcissistic, and much of a buffoon.
[02:38:55.718 --> 02:39:03.264]  And it came back to haunt him, his background, having worked with the Nazis and having tried, you know, trying to make something of himself.
[02:39:03.604 --> 02:39:05.846]  When he's really not relevant to the United States.
[02:39:05.846 --> 02:39:06.907]  No, I agree.
[02:39:06.907 --> 02:39:09.149]  But his money is a big problem.
[02:39:09.149 --> 02:39:11.510]  So you're mainly focused on the illegal alien invasion.
[02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:12.631]  I'm glad you want to go there.
[02:39:12.631 --> 02:39:13.952]  But take the pipe bombs.
[02:39:13.952 --> 02:39:22.980]  I know they're not a big deal, but the fact that the media jumped on it, they went with it, it's admittedly, even all the experts on mainstream TV admit they're fake now.
[02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:24.121]  It's totally backfired.
[02:39:24.121 --> 02:39:25.242]  Why is everything
[02:39:25.962 --> 02:39:36.128]  The leftist twisted, they're not even leftists, the whole Hillary thing that's still halfway attached to our country, just everything it does turns to pure crap.
[02:39:36.128 --> 02:39:44.372]  As a psychiatrist, as a psych warfare expert, as a military officer, as everything you've done, why is suddenly everything they're doing turning to pure garbage?
[02:39:44.372 --> 02:39:45.173]  I've never seen anything like it.
[02:39:46.144 --> 02:39:48.647]  Well, it's not suddenly that they're turning to garbage.
[02:39:48.647 --> 02:39:50.849]  It's been that it's always been garbage.
[02:39:50.849 --> 02:39:56.095]  I mean, one of the things that we have to look back is that Hillary... No, I agree, but the public sees it as garbage.
[02:39:56.095 --> 02:39:56.735]  That's different.
[02:39:56.735 --> 02:39:57.516]  Well, no, no, no.
[02:39:57.516 --> 02:40:00.700]  Well, that's the perception and the manipulation of the press.
[02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:04.604]  But I've got to say, you know, I've got to defend and sometimes the press.
[02:40:04.604 --> 02:40:05.525]  I'll give you an example.
[02:40:06.085 --> 02:40:17.799]  The New York Times just went after Jeff Zucker for having made comments about the fact that he implicated the President as the source of dissension within the United States.
[02:40:17.799 --> 02:40:24.327]  If you look at Maureen Dowd's article on Zucker, she says he's the worst, absolutely the worst
[02:40:24.887 --> 02:40:28.889]  CEO that any network has ever had at any time.
[02:40:28.889 --> 02:40:30.110]  Frank Brunei.
[02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:39.375]  I mean, I don't know these individuals, but he went after Jared Kushner three days ago in an article that mimicked exactly what we've been saying for years.
[02:40:39.375 --> 02:40:41.296]  Get rid of Jared Kushner.
[02:40:41.296 --> 02:40:45.278]  So there are those within the system who are really speaking out now.
[02:40:46.027 --> 02:40:48.708]  Do we blame everybody with a broad stroke?
[02:40:48.708 --> 02:40:49.148]  No.
[02:40:49.148 --> 02:40:52.109]  It's the same way the Alex Jones Show goes.
[02:40:52.109 --> 02:41:01.153]  They can say whatever they want about Alex Jones, but the truth of the matter is Alex Jones, the persona, the total
[02:41:01.974 --> 02:41:08.177]  The ambiance of what you are and who you are, it's more than you as a person, will exist and continue.
[02:41:08.177 --> 02:41:09.098]  Believe me.
[02:41:09.098 --> 02:41:11.039]  There's no way... No, I know that.
[02:41:11.039 --> 02:41:12.380]  And it's not about me.
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:13.760]  You're right, it's this persona.
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:14.661]  It's this paradox.
[02:41:14.661 --> 02:41:18.563]  They built me into Godzilla, and then now I'm ten times bigger.
[02:41:20.186 --> 02:41:27.028]  Roger Stone said something very interesting, which I still quote, and I think he hit it right on the head.
[02:41:27.028 --> 02:41:40.351]  Roger said, look, what we're in the process of is measuring to what degree our systems can tolerate dissension within a cyber nation or an internet, a binary system.
[02:41:40.351 --> 02:41:43.432]  You happen to be the measuring stick.
[02:41:44.692 --> 02:41:48.054]  You're a very effective measuring stick because you don't give up.
[02:41:48.054 --> 02:41:49.334]  You have a great sense of humor.
[02:41:49.334 --> 02:41:53.415]  It's not about you, but you've collected a group of people.
[02:41:53.415 --> 02:41:58.537]  Let me tell you, Austin, Texas was not the center of the world 20 years ago.
[02:41:58.537 --> 02:42:06.060]  Now, thanks to you and the Jim Baker Association and all the Bushes and all, Austin has become a major center.
[02:42:06.658 --> 02:42:12.022]  Of learning, of, you know, intelligence, and that didn't happen by chance.
[02:42:12.022 --> 02:42:14.044]  Who talks about New York nowadays?
[02:42:14.044 --> 02:42:15.885]  Who talks about Cornell or Harvard?
[02:42:15.885 --> 02:42:16.706]  That's exactly what happened.
[02:42:16.706 --> 02:42:17.246]  I said it would move.
[02:42:27.526 --> 02:42:28.607]  Right to the South.
[02:42:28.607 --> 02:42:33.589]  I said it would be Texas, it would be Florida, it would be New Mexico, Oklahoma.
[02:42:33.589 --> 02:42:35.549]  Basically, we are now the power.
[02:42:35.549 --> 02:42:37.870]  The Northeast is finished.
[02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:39.471]  The West Coast is finished.
[02:42:39.471 --> 02:42:41.872]  I mean, it's replete with homeless.
[02:42:41.872 --> 02:42:43.293]  When the New York Times... Well, stay there.
[02:42:43.293 --> 02:42:44.153]  Let's talk about this.
[02:42:44.153 --> 02:42:45.554]  And we're not pleased that's the case.
[02:42:45.554 --> 02:42:48.835]  But before we can have renewal, we've got to face the facts.
[02:42:48.835 --> 02:42:51.376]  But what if they flee here and turn us into that?
[02:42:51.376 --> 02:42:52.416]  That's another problem.
[02:42:52.416 --> 02:42:53.377]  And your call's coming up.
[02:42:55.097 --> 02:43:05.687]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.687 --> 02:43:07.749]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:43:07.749 --> 02:43:10.611]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:43:10.611 --> 02:43:12.113]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.113 --> 02:43:18.939]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:43:18.939 --> 02:43:20.200]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:43:21.001 --> 02:43:30.703]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:43:30.703 --> 02:43:47.507]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:47.507 --> 02:43:50.668]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:43:50.828 --> 02:43:54.432]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:44:00.262 --> 02:44:08.945]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:44:08.945 --> 02:44:10.926]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:44:10.926 --> 02:44:14.387]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:44:14.387 --> 02:44:17.008]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:44:17.008 --> 02:44:19.289]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:44:19.289 --> 02:44:26.232]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[02:44:26.792 --> 02:44:36.576]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:44:36.576 --> 02:44:37.777]  We'll win.
[02:44:37.777 --> 02:44:40.058]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:44:40.058 --> 02:44:47.821]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce, and your right to the market.
[02:44:47.821 --> 02:44:51.523]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[02:44:51.523 --> 02:44:53.063]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[02:44:53.063 --> 02:44:53.744]  We need your support.
[02:44:53.744 --> 02:44:54.484]  I'm counting on you.
[02:44:55.814 --> 02:45:01.136]  They now know that InfoWars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[02:45:01.136 --> 02:45:03.217]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[02:45:03.217 --> 02:45:09.340]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama, and to Warren Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[02:45:09.340 --> 02:45:10.240]  Come to their door.
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.741]  I'm death, and they know it.
[02:45:11.741 --> 02:45:12.881]  I'm death of their system.
[02:45:13.001 --> 02:45:28.467]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast we'll be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products and we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history and it has got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products and we are hurting.
[02:45:28.507 --> 02:45:29.207]  We're good to go.
[02:45:56.084 --> 02:46:01.128]  Please, tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your community, constantly, this is a censored show.
[02:46:01.128 --> 02:46:02.289]  They want to shut it down.
[02:46:02.289 --> 02:46:03.910]  Don't let them do it.
[02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:06.011]  Infowars.com.
[02:46:06.011 --> 02:46:07.252]  We're in your hands.
[02:46:07.252 --> 02:46:21.142]  If you don't spread the word about Infowars, if you don't spread the word about Newswars.com, if you don't get the great Patriot t-shirts with all the beautiful designs, if you don't get the water filtration and air filtration that's the best out there, very low prices, if you don't get the great supplements, we won't be here.
[02:46:21.142 --> 02:46:21.843]  It's up to you.
[02:46:21.843 --> 02:46:24.345]  And you've been responding, you've been supporting, so I want to thank you.
[02:46:24.685 --> 02:46:27.746]  You're also getting really great products like X2, the last run of it.
[02:46:27.746 --> 02:46:28.866]  Secret 12, amazing.
[02:46:28.866 --> 02:46:30.467]  Vitamin B12, the highest quality.
[02:46:30.467 --> 02:46:32.467]  Brain Force Plus, now at 20% more.
[02:46:32.467 --> 02:46:37.109]  It's all 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping.
[02:46:37.109 --> 02:46:45.051]  But it's got to end by this weekend because so many of the great products are running low, like Knockout, the great sleep aid, like Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[02:46:45.051 --> 02:46:46.431]  Nobody can get it at that price.
[02:46:46.431 --> 02:46:48.352]  But you are the folks that have stood with us
[02:46:48.772 --> 02:46:52.156]  So it's a 360 win-win at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:52.156 --> 02:46:52.817]  Please take action.
[02:46:52.817 --> 02:46:54.278]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.494 --> 02:47:25.942]  Alright, I promise all these amazing callers that are holding, I'm gonna take over Roger Stone's time, part of it next hour, go right to your calls, then host with Roger Stone, Ethan, right through Riley, and we're gonna go to all of you, but here's a few crazy clips.
[02:47:27.228 --> 02:47:27.909]  ...of Democrats.
[02:47:27.909 --> 02:47:34.213]  It's a small smattering calling for violence and now saying nationalism and the existence of the country is dirty.
[02:47:34.213 --> 02:47:40.757]  I asked Rob Dew to put together a compilation the last two days of them saying Trump is evil for saying nationalism.
[02:47:40.757 --> 02:47:42.499]  He had a 14-minute clip.
[02:47:42.499 --> 02:47:44.860]  The average person was like 20 seconds.
[02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:45.601]  I said, cut it down.
[02:47:45.601 --> 02:47:47.262]  He cut it down to six minutes.
[02:47:47.262 --> 02:47:48.423]  We never even aired the thing.
[02:47:48.423 --> 02:47:49.583]  It's too depressing to watch.
[02:47:49.583 --> 02:47:53.186]  But this is them trying to demoralize us, saying we don't even have a country.
[02:47:53.186 --> 02:47:54.227]  Well, then what do we have?
[02:47:54.227 --> 02:47:55.708]  Who sticks up for our interest, our culture?
[02:47:56.448 --> 02:47:57.769]  This is why they're gonna lose.
[02:47:57.769 --> 02:48:01.690]  They're telling us that America doesn't exist and that we're the bad guys.
[02:48:01.690 --> 02:48:04.471]  Here's a few of the clips.
[02:48:04.471 --> 02:48:07.172]  I'm angry.
[02:48:07.172 --> 02:48:07.632]  Yes!
[02:48:07.632 --> 02:48:11.514]  I am outraged.
[02:48:11.514 --> 02:48:11.894]  Yes!
[02:48:13.084 --> 02:48:18.505]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:48:18.505 --> 02:48:25.747]  For when he was elected, what I wrote on Twitter was, we should impose martial law until we make sure that the Russians weren't involved in the final tallies of the votes.
[02:48:25.747 --> 02:48:28.748]  And Bob Mueller has indicted 13 Russians for election meddling.
[02:48:28.748 --> 02:48:30.008]  And people were like, martial law?
[02:48:30.008 --> 02:48:30.848]  What's wrong with you?
[02:48:30.848 --> 02:48:31.849]  You're a lunatic.
[02:48:31.849 --> 02:48:34.149]  He wants to send the military to the border, so.
[02:48:34.149 --> 02:48:36.510]  I want to send the military to the White House to get him.
[02:48:36.510 --> 02:48:39.350]  No, who's in command of them?
[02:48:39.350 --> 02:48:41.411]  We're not going to make America great again.
[02:48:42.426 --> 02:48:44.188]  It was never that great.
[02:48:44.188 --> 02:48:47.211]  Jesus.
[02:48:47.211 --> 02:48:51.395]  We have not reached greatness.
[02:48:51.395 --> 02:49:00.624]  We will reach greatness.
[02:49:00.624 --> 02:49:01.565]  Wow.
[02:49:01.565 --> 02:49:02.466]  Wow, you're a piece of crap.
[02:49:02.466 --> 02:49:04.448]  I'm a nationalist.
[02:49:04.448 --> 02:49:05.089]  Nationalist.
[02:49:06.249 --> 02:49:07.310]  Use that word.
[02:49:07.310 --> 02:49:09.171]  We're going to talk about that word tonight.
[02:49:09.171 --> 02:49:11.233]  It is a favorite of the alt-right.
[02:49:11.233 --> 02:49:11.973]  I'll shut him down.
[02:49:11.973 --> 02:49:14.034]  He goes on to demonize it.
[02:49:14.034 --> 02:49:24.822]  The bubbles they live in and the gaslighting they're trying to do, Dr. Steve Pachenik, is like something out of a Kurt Vonnegut novel of just a grand felonry.
[02:49:24.822 --> 02:49:34.008]  And I just wonder where they're going to go next trying to suppress the recovery, trying to suppress the country, and trying to do this.
[02:49:34.008 --> 02:49:35.229]  What do you as a psychiatrist
[02:49:37.949 --> 02:49:55.060]  Well, number one, you have to understand every one of those individuals from Madonna to Andrew Cuomo never served in our country.
[02:49:55.060 --> 02:50:01.384]  So you have to understand that most of the people, most of the actors, the politicians,
[02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:03.201]  On the left or whatever.
[02:50:03.201 --> 02:50:04.622]  I mean, she's an idiot.
[02:50:04.622 --> 02:50:06.383]  I've seen her at Warner Books.
[02:50:06.383 --> 02:50:07.744]  She's not very bright.
[02:50:07.744 --> 02:50:13.428]  She's I don't find her a great entertainer, but they're all self-made personas.
[02:50:13.428 --> 02:50:15.970]  I mean, you have Andrew Cuomo.
[02:50:15.970 --> 02:50:17.491]  Do you really his mother?
[02:50:17.491 --> 02:50:20.052]  I happen to know his mother and she was very lovely.
[02:50:20.052 --> 02:50:24.976]  I needed her in Zimbabwe, but you're talking about the grandson of a mafioso.
[02:50:25.815 --> 02:50:32.061]  Cuomo has never really done anything other than to be a corrupt politician in New York State.
[02:50:32.061 --> 02:50:33.683]  I came out of New York State.
[02:50:33.683 --> 02:50:39.168]  If you were to say anything about the Cuomo family, you'd know the next word is mafia.
[02:50:39.168 --> 02:50:40.209]  He never served.
[02:50:40.209 --> 02:50:41.870]  He never had any nationality.
[02:50:41.870 --> 02:50:43.532]  He never made his bones like grandpa.
[02:50:44.361 --> 02:50:45.682]  No, that's exactly right.
[02:50:45.682 --> 02:50:48.804]  So what you have here are the pretenders.
[02:50:48.804 --> 02:50:50.405]  These aren't people of action.
[02:50:50.405 --> 02:50:51.846]  You and I are action.
[02:50:51.846 --> 02:50:53.448]  You either do it or you don't do it.
[02:50:53.448 --> 02:50:58.071]  Lady, Madonna is nothing but self-aggrandizement and narcissism.
[02:50:58.071 --> 02:51:01.594]  Rosianne, nothing but narcissism, grandiosity.
[02:51:01.594 --> 02:51:04.155]  Como, grandiosity, narcissism.
[02:51:04.155 --> 02:51:10.320]  Not one day that they ever decide to say, there's the mayor, another piece of
[02:51:11.434 --> 02:51:12.915]  Insignificant nothing!
[02:51:12.915 --> 02:51:14.617]  He doesn't do anything in New York.
[02:51:14.617 --> 02:51:16.618]  He hasn't built a business.
[02:51:16.618 --> 02:51:18.500]  He married a former lesbian.
[02:51:18.500 --> 02:51:20.061]  Let me raise this point to you.
[02:51:20.061 --> 02:51:31.870]  What person, because America that produced George Washington, Martin Luther King, who was a great person, Martin Luther King Jr., for the courage he had in his oratory and the things he did, and people like
[02:51:32.651 --> 02:51:38.116]  People like Neil Armstrong and they say America isn't great.
[02:51:38.116 --> 02:51:46.603]  I mean, that is what is this leftist thing of telling us we suck all day and then telling us it's just that what's wrong with these people?
[02:51:47.639 --> 02:51:51.881]  Well, what's wrong is the fact that they're not in touch with reality.
[02:51:51.881 --> 02:51:53.022]  They don't work every day.
[02:51:53.022 --> 02:51:56.404]  They don't have to hustle every day to make a living.
[02:51:56.404 --> 02:52:02.567]  They don't go on the highway and drive trucks, where we have the greatest number of truck drivers.
[02:52:02.567 --> 02:52:04.288]  They don't build bridges.
[02:52:04.288 --> 02:52:06.849]  They haven't created anything that's concrete.
[02:52:06.849 --> 02:52:10.912]  What they are, and I've said it from day one, these are processed people.
[02:52:10.912 --> 02:52:15.354]  These are people who are in process, never having to account for anything.
[02:52:15.354 --> 02:52:17.175]  Even though Madonna produces a record,
[02:52:17.635 --> 02:52:18.856]  She's not relevant.
[02:52:18.856 --> 02:52:23.340]  And the time of relevancy is very short for most of these people.
[02:52:23.340 --> 02:52:31.546]  So when they come to the end of their life, they basically say some absurdities to which they have no involvement.
[02:52:31.546 --> 02:52:33.007]  They've never served our country.
[02:52:33.007 --> 02:52:35.829]  They never went overseas to represent America.
[02:52:35.829 --> 02:52:38.871]  They never had to fight anybody to say, I'm an American.
[02:52:38.871 --> 02:52:41.193]  They never had to really create a strategy.
[02:52:41.193 --> 02:52:43.435]  By the way, President Trump recognizes this.
[02:52:43.435 --> 02:52:45.957]  He says, before I ever heard on the news, I was told this,
[02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:48.810]  I was born into a great country.
[02:52:48.810 --> 02:52:49.351]  I did great.
[02:52:49.351 --> 02:52:50.011]  I love this nation.
[02:52:50.011 --> 02:52:51.932]  But all over the world, America's amazing.
[02:52:51.932 --> 02:52:55.495]  You know, I like Scotland, but you know, it's not even as good as the U.S.
[02:52:55.495 --> 02:52:56.956]  And I love the people.
[02:52:56.956 --> 02:53:02.420]  And I haven't served, but now I'm going to serve by being demonized and being lied about and working 18 hours a day.
[02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:02.821]  And he is.
[02:53:02.821 --> 02:53:03.621]  He's the commander in chief.
[02:53:03.621 --> 02:53:05.122]  And Trump is serving now.
[02:53:05.122 --> 02:53:06.383]  He is in the firing line.
[02:53:06.383 --> 02:53:08.765]  But he respects that and he gets that.
[02:53:08.765 --> 02:53:13.849]  And now at 72, for the last four years, since he's 68, he has been serving.
[02:53:14.534 --> 02:53:15.155]  That's it.
[02:53:15.155 --> 02:53:17.518]  Now you hit it on the head, and I agree with you.
[02:53:17.518 --> 02:53:21.082]  He has served our country, and he's still serving it.
[02:53:21.082 --> 02:53:23.305]  And he understood where the problem was.
[02:53:23.305 --> 02:53:25.387]  He's lost $2 billion in this fight.
[02:53:25.387 --> 02:53:26.889]  That's serving.
[02:53:26.889 --> 02:53:28.211]  Well, but it's not only that.
[02:53:28.211 --> 02:53:33.617]  You have to remember from the very time, and I remember 42nd Street when he built the hotel.
[02:53:33.617 --> 02:53:33.998]  He did it.
[02:53:34.651 --> 02:53:36.793]  How he did it is not relevant.
[02:53:36.793 --> 02:53:39.275]  When we, I had kids in New York.
[02:53:39.275 --> 02:53:40.075]  What is the word?
[02:53:40.075 --> 02:53:46.220]  Because let's be honest, he's not mafia, but how did his Fred Trump and then him do things in cities that nobody else could do?
[02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:50.364]  I heard behind the scenes, Fred Trump would beat the hell out of, I mean, not, not with thugs.
[02:53:50.364 --> 02:53:52.765]  I heard Fred Trump would take on like three, four guys himself.
[02:53:52.765 --> 02:53:54.467]  And that was just basically respected him so much.
[02:53:55.424 --> 02:53:56.584]  Well, that's the point.
[02:53:56.584 --> 02:54:02.387]  You know, when you're in the business of creation, when you're in the business of building, you can't be a nice guy.
[02:54:02.387 --> 02:54:04.387]  This is not about being the nice guy.
[02:54:04.387 --> 02:54:07.109]  This is about the person who says, get it done.
[02:54:07.109 --> 02:54:09.870]  We have X amount of time, X amount of materials.
[02:54:09.870 --> 02:54:10.870]  Get it done on the time.
[02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:11.510]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:17.493]  How could Trump push the mafia out in areas of New York nobody else could?
[02:54:17.493 --> 02:54:19.934]  I don't know whether he pushed them out or he co-opted them.
[02:54:19.934 --> 02:54:23.495]  What he basically did in the construction... Well, sure, he did what nobody else could do.
[02:54:24.369 --> 02:54:27.290]  That's because he understood how to work with them.
[02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:39.673]  If you have the mafia or you have any other group of individuals, it doesn't matter what you call them, as long as you utilize them, as long as you understand what the quid pro quo is and you can work with them, that works.
[02:54:39.673 --> 02:54:43.514]  Corruption is an innate aspect of any system.
[02:54:43.514 --> 02:54:47.695]  Whether they want more or less, that's up to Trump or that's up to the builder.
[02:54:47.695 --> 02:54:50.596]  But the reality is you're not pristine in this world.
[02:54:50.956 --> 02:54:55.621]  You can't come out of self-righteous and suddenly say, oh, I'm above this all.
[02:54:55.621 --> 02:55:02.728]  Even Zucker, who was the one who said something about Trump, the guy was the worst manager of NBC.
[02:55:02.728 --> 02:55:08.634]  He had the worst ratings in the history of NBC, yet he was given $30 billion, a million dollars to leave.
[02:55:09.154 --> 02:55:12.595]  Now he takes over CNN, a dead entity.
[02:55:12.595 --> 02:55:20.937]  I was on CNN 25 years ago when it was first started and we were working up in Northwest Washington.
[02:55:20.937 --> 02:55:22.838]  It was barely a studio.
[02:55:22.838 --> 02:55:25.639]  So it became an entity under Ted Turner.
[02:55:25.639 --> 02:55:32.520]  The guys like Turner, guys exactly like Trump and others, they build, they create.
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:33.561]  That's what we're about.
[02:55:33.561 --> 02:55:36.902]  And even Turner has told CNN to stop trying to sabotage America.
[02:55:36.902 --> 02:55:37.962]  He says it's embarrassing.
[02:55:38.709 --> 02:55:39.749]  It is embarrassing.
[02:55:39.749 --> 02:55:41.250]  And Ted Turner's no fool.
[02:55:41.250 --> 02:55:42.530]  He's up in Montana.
[02:55:42.530 --> 02:55:43.931]  He raises beefalo.
[02:55:43.931 --> 02:55:46.311]  He created a restaurant chain.
[02:55:46.311 --> 02:55:54.074]  In other words, those of us who belong to America understand that the essence of America is the right for us to make mistakes.
[02:55:54.734 --> 02:55:57.257]  Not to succeed, but to make mistakes.
[02:55:57.257 --> 02:55:59.700]  Go to Russia and see if you can make mistakes.
[02:55:59.700 --> 02:56:05.606]  Go to France and see what a disaster it was when I told you Macron would be a disaster when he came in.
[02:56:16.698 --> 02:56:17.719]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:56:17.719 --> 02:56:18.620]  Trump understands Powell.
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:20.822]  Powell is a very serious man from Chevy Chase, Maryland.
[02:56:20.822 --> 02:56:21.342]  He understands that
[02:56:38.246 --> 02:56:44.027]  Increasing the interest rates by 25 basis points is going to have a certain effect.
[02:56:44.027 --> 02:56:48.328]  But Trump put him in there so he could have a guy to work off of.
[02:56:48.328 --> 02:56:50.748]  The economy is doing well.
[02:56:50.748 --> 02:56:59.810]  The reason there was a pullback is that the uncertainty that's coming in repeatedly and the noise that's in the background is creating all kinds of problems.
[02:56:59.810 --> 02:57:01.910]  But there is a real problem.
[02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:03.911]  Facebook is not doing well.
[02:57:03.911 --> 02:57:06.031]  Twitter has to improve its performance.
[02:57:06.531 --> 02:57:08.872]  Square has to improve its performance.
[02:57:08.872 --> 02:57:12.193]  The head of Square and... Hold on, let's do five more minutes.
[02:57:12.193 --> 02:57:12.914]  We've got to take a break.
[02:57:12.914 --> 02:57:13.394]  Exactly.
[02:57:13.394 --> 02:57:22.778]  And if you look at the algorithms and what they even admit, the censorship Big Tech did, and not even taking campaign money from conservatives this cycle, they're killing themselves with the censorship!
[02:57:22.778 --> 02:57:26.999]  It's conservatives and nationalists and businesses that actually empower Twitter and Facebook.
[02:57:26.999 --> 02:57:30.821]  They've killed us so they can be big, and they're bringing the whole economy down.
[02:57:30.821 --> 02:57:32.622]  Meanwhile, we're doing better than ever.
[02:57:32.622 --> 02:57:34.022]  Thanks for all your support.
[02:57:34.022 --> 02:57:35.103]  Infowars.com.
[02:57:35.103 --> 02:57:35.723]  Newswars.com.
[02:57:36.403 --> 02:57:38.365]  But what I really want to do is reach new people.
[02:57:38.365 --> 02:57:40.146]  So share the live link, share the articles.
[02:57:40.146 --> 02:57:42.908]  You are unstoppable when you get excited and take action.
[02:57:42.908 --> 02:57:45.250]  Hour number four, two minutes away.
[02:57:45.250 --> 02:57:53.637]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:57:53.637 --> 02:57:55.098]  Believe me, I know.
[02:57:55.098 --> 02:57:59.802]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:57:59.802 --> 02:58:04.806]  But thanks to super male vitality at inputwarestore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:58:05.026 --> 02:58:25.180]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:29.643]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:58:29.643 --> 02:58:33.345]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:58:33.345 --> 02:58:38.349]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:58:38.349 --> 02:58:41.071]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:58:41.071 --> 02:58:43.913]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:46.184 --> 02:58:48.887]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:58:48.887 --> 02:58:55.214]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:58:55.214 --> 02:58:56.996]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:58:56.996 --> 02:59:03.563]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[02:59:03.763 --> 02:59:04.103]  I think so.
[02:59:21.476 --> 02:59:21.956]  I think so.
[02:59:49.193 --> 02:59:58.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:58.680 --> 03:00:05.264]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:00:05.264 --> 03:00:09.167]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:16.770 --> 03:00:25.452]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.452 --> 03:00:34.114]  All right, Steve McKinnick for five more minutes, and then I promise, even though these calls are all great, I took like eight or nine of them, but I spent like five minutes apiece with them earlier, and then we had a guest on, so that's why you've been holding.
[03:00:34.114 --> 03:00:35.915]  I'm going until you have the break.
[03:00:35.915 --> 03:00:36.155]  Ethan,
[03:00:37.795 --> 03:00:42.558]  And then Riley, and Steve, and everybody else who want to write to you.
[03:00:42.558 --> 03:00:47.441]  And then Rodgers Jones, Lothar Berry's coming up, former head of the Trump campaign.
[03:00:47.441 --> 03:00:50.563]  Mueller's been breathing down his neck with made-up stuff, obsessing on me.
[03:00:50.563 --> 03:00:55.607]  But the word is, because I know nothing's there, that it's all about to be derailed very, very soon.
[03:00:55.607 --> 03:01:02.051]  Dr. Puccini, getting into the economy, we have an article on DrudgeReport.com with the 2,000 plus points that have been lost.
[03:01:02.911 --> 03:01:08.238]  So far this year and all the cheerleading by the Federal Reserve, everybody, to drive down things.
[03:01:08.238 --> 03:01:13.344]  If they're successful doing that, I don't think the public's gonna blame Trump.
[03:01:13.344 --> 03:01:16.788]  I think this is a very dangerous game that some of the deep state's playing.
[03:01:16.788 --> 03:01:17.189]  What do you think?
[03:01:18.513 --> 03:01:26.905]  Well, what's really going on, remember, the stock market is really six months ahead of where the news is.
[03:01:26.905 --> 03:01:33.935]  The uncertainty right now regarding the election, that is one of the major drives for the pullback.
[03:01:34.582 --> 03:01:39.408]  The concern is, quite frankly, the market does not want Democrats.
[03:01:39.408 --> 03:01:41.991]  Now forget the notion who they are.
[03:01:41.991 --> 03:01:46.076]  The market will not tolerate Democrats coming into any position.
[03:01:46.076 --> 03:01:46.396]  Exactly.
[03:01:46.396 --> 03:01:48.578]  The market doesn't like Venezuelization.
[03:01:49.284 --> 03:01:50.124]  Correct.
[03:01:50.124 --> 03:01:53.526]  And the market is basically saying what I'm saying and what you're saying.
[03:01:53.526 --> 03:01:56.027]  We're going to have Republicans in Florida.
[03:01:56.027 --> 03:01:57.928]  We have DeSantis over Gillum.
[03:01:57.928 --> 03:02:01.050]  Gillum has been indicted and investigated by the FBI.
[03:02:01.050 --> 03:02:08.434]  DeSantis is a gentleman who went to Harvard, Yale, poor Italian family, and then ended up to be Jag and the Seals.
[03:02:08.434 --> 03:02:12.576]  Then we have Rick Scott, the former governor against Bill Nelson.
[03:02:13.096 --> 03:02:14.817]  An old geriatric patient.
[03:02:14.817 --> 03:02:18.738]  So you're predicting a red wave, but there's uncertainty until that happens.
[03:02:18.738 --> 03:02:21.719]  But just like when Trump got elected, the stock market went straight up.
[03:02:21.719 --> 03:02:24.060]  You're saying if that happens, the uncertainty will be out.
[03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:27.922]  That will go away and the markets will climb within 12 days.
[03:02:27.922 --> 03:02:33.924]  I predict that there will be Republicans everywhere that Trump went in, including Montana.
[03:02:33.924 --> 03:02:35.965]  When you have Jon Tester, whom I know,
[03:02:36.305 --> 03:02:38.126]  Sure, sure, in the time we have.
[03:02:38.126 --> 03:02:39.687]  What about Abinanti, the little
[03:02:57.395 --> 03:03:05.287]  Porn lawyer and the other people, now they're basically set to be indicted with Senate criminal investigations.
[03:03:05.287 --> 03:03:07.750]  I mean, it looks like the wheels are coming off the Democrats.
[03:03:08.564 --> 03:03:09.445]  Correct.
[03:03:09.445 --> 03:03:10.847]  And it's all turning around.
[03:03:10.847 --> 03:03:12.088]  Mueller will be out.
[03:03:12.088 --> 03:03:16.593]  Mueller's had a history that's so replete with problems.
[03:03:16.593 --> 03:03:28.588]  If I were Roger Stone, I would not worry about it because Mueller could be indicted for one of a hundred things, whether it's 9-11, whether it's, you know... When did he get compromised?
[03:03:29.494 --> 03:03:30.834]  He is so compromised.
[03:03:30.834 --> 03:03:32.195]  That's why they put him there.
[03:03:32.195 --> 03:03:33.355]  And Trump knows that.
[03:03:33.355 --> 03:03:34.435]  Mueller knows that.
[03:03:34.435 --> 03:03:35.915]  He's totally an ineffectual.
[03:03:35.915 --> 03:03:38.156]  He was.
[03:03:38.156 --> 03:03:38.956]  He went to St.
[03:03:38.956 --> 03:03:40.817]  Paul's, went to Princeton.
[03:03:40.817 --> 03:03:43.777]  He did the walk, but he couldn't do anything else.
[03:03:43.777 --> 03:03:45.237]  He was ineffectual.
[03:03:45.237 --> 03:03:48.698]  I must say, though, in Vietnam, he was quite a brave soldier.
[03:03:48.698 --> 03:03:51.659]  But after that, he compromised his entire integrity.
[03:03:53.401 --> 03:03:56.144]  So we got 60 seconds left.
[03:03:56.144 --> 03:04:01.470]  What does the deep state leftists do when we have a red wave and everything falls in on them?
[03:04:01.470 --> 03:04:02.451]  Do they get even crazier?
[03:04:03.584 --> 03:04:07.346]  They will try to attempt, basically, there be self-immolation.
[03:04:07.346 --> 03:04:09.807]  In other words, what they will do is self-destruct.
[03:04:09.807 --> 03:04:20.131]  By the time the election comes around, you will see the Clintons out, you will see Cory Booker out, you will see a whole bunch of these Democrats who are flawed.
[03:04:20.131 --> 03:04:26.074]  And you're saying from your sources, because I agree from my own research, the analytics show a red wave unless election fraud's so bad.
[03:04:26.912 --> 03:04:27.632]  That's correct.
[03:04:27.632 --> 03:04:32.935]  And I would say the Republicans will storm over this country and the economy will come back.
[03:04:32.935 --> 03:04:34.916]  And I'm not whistling Dixie.
[03:04:34.916 --> 03:04:45.180]  I'm just saying it from the obvious place where I'm here in Florida, and I see what happens when we have no state taxes, we have Republicans in a certain area, we're doing exceedingly well.
[03:04:45.180 --> 03:04:49.202]  Sure, and from the South and from Texas and the Midwest, America can grow back and heal itself.
[03:04:49.202 --> 03:04:50.763]  Dr. Sheep, God bless you.
[03:04:50.763 --> 03:04:52.804]  We'll be right back with phone calls and Roger Stone.
[03:04:52.804 --> 03:04:53.104]  Thank you.

[03:05:56.871 --> 03:05:58.672]  Mainstream media.
[03:05:58.672 --> 03:06:00.573]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:00.573 --> 03:06:02.273]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:02.273 --> 03:06:03.934]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:03.934 --> 03:06:10.257]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.257 --> 03:06:11.577]  We got 20 phone lines.
[03:06:11.577 --> 03:06:16.399]  We actually have like a thousand digitally, but we put 20 on the board, so it's always the guilty paradox.
[03:06:16.399 --> 03:06:18.400]  I'll take like 10 calls an hour, but then there's 20 more.
[03:06:19.800 --> 03:06:22.343]  I appreciate you holding while Pchenik was on for much of an hour.
[03:06:22.343 --> 03:06:23.765]  What a smart guy, man.
[03:06:23.765 --> 03:06:30.713]  That guy, the longer I'm alive and remember all the stuff he said, the smarter I know he is.
[03:06:30.713 --> 03:06:32.636]  People used to have him on like 18 years ago.
[03:06:32.636 --> 03:06:33.677]  He's CFR.
[03:06:33.677 --> 03:06:37.141]  He was the head of the CIA psychological operations.
[03:06:37.141 --> 03:06:38.683]  What are you, are you selling out to him?
[03:06:38.683 --> 03:06:38.863]  No!
[03:06:39.924 --> 03:06:41.725]  Those are the patriots.
[03:06:41.725 --> 03:06:43.607]  It's the leftists and the globalists.
[03:06:43.607 --> 03:06:45.088]  You want people on the inside.
[03:06:45.088 --> 03:06:46.789]  You want to take America back.
[03:06:46.789 --> 03:06:47.930]  You want to win.
[03:06:47.930 --> 03:06:49.852]  We're not always just going to sit out here on the outside.
[03:06:49.852 --> 03:06:52.093]  I'm trying to explain that to people.
[03:06:52.093 --> 03:06:54.075]  Now, Republicans totally take over.
[03:06:54.075 --> 03:06:55.356]  They should split into two parties.
[03:06:55.356 --> 03:07:00.099]  And if I see any hanky-panky, I'm going to go after everybody.
[03:07:00.099 --> 03:07:06.564]  But right now, the Democrats say you're bad if you believe in America, and they hate free market, and they hate wealth for average people.
[03:07:06.564 --> 03:07:07.365]  They're the enemy!
[03:07:09.537 --> 03:07:11.298]  And I see Trump fighting as hard as he can.
[03:07:11.298 --> 03:07:11.898]  Is he perfect?
[03:07:11.898 --> 03:07:12.678]  No!
[03:07:12.678 --> 03:07:14.499]  But I'm... People are like, well, you're anti-government.
[03:07:14.499 --> 03:07:17.860]  Why do you love Trump so... I'm not anti-government!
[03:07:17.860 --> 03:07:23.101]  I'm anti... people that want to destroy the Republic.
[03:07:23.101 --> 03:07:29.183]  I like seeing nations become Christian and promote wholesomeness and goodness and have children like Russia.
[03:07:29.183 --> 03:07:30.784]  Stand against radical Islam.
[03:07:30.784 --> 03:07:32.844]  I like seeing that happen in Italy.
[03:07:32.844 --> 03:07:37.886]  And here, you think I want to see these countries... I like seeing Brazil set to elect a guy more right-wing than Trump.
[03:07:41.502 --> 03:07:43.083]  So, Roger Stone's coming up.
[03:07:43.083 --> 03:07:44.543]  I'm going to take your phone calls right now.
[03:07:44.543 --> 03:07:45.963]  I really appreciate it.
[03:07:45.963 --> 03:07:51.925]  Ethan, everybody else holding, but I'm going to have to move quick because I don't want you to hold anymore.
[03:07:51.925 --> 03:07:55.166]  Ethan, in the great state of Texas, you're on the air.
[03:07:55.166 --> 03:07:57.567]  EOD, Ordnance Disposal, 10 years.
[03:07:57.567 --> 03:08:02.569]  Give us your take on the bombs and the bomber, even though no bombing happened.
[03:08:02.569 --> 03:08:03.429]  What is your view on this?
[03:08:04.710 --> 03:08:13.995]  Well, I was thinking about it, I saw a tweet today, well actually it was from a couple days ago, Hillary Clinton, October 22nd, whatever you choose to do, do something.
[03:08:13.995 --> 03:08:17.778]  Within two weeks before the election, we don't have a moment to lose.
[03:08:17.778 --> 03:08:23.541]  Next day, Soros gets bombed, and then the next day after that.
[03:08:23.541 --> 03:08:30.665]  My idea is that these are all the DSA kind of people that the Veritas exposed,
[03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:35.792]  Because if you look at the map, they're all over the country all at the exact same time.
[03:08:35.792 --> 03:08:39.535]  There's no way this is one single guy making this.
[03:08:39.535 --> 03:08:42.017]  This is some coordinated effort.
[03:08:42.017 --> 03:08:44.919]  And doesn't it fit Antifa perfectly?
[03:08:44.919 --> 03:08:54.526]  They're willing to go up on Twitter with hundreds of thousands of followers, university professors, and say, kill Pence, kill Trump, kill Jones, and they don't get in trouble.
[03:08:54.526 --> 03:08:56.768]  Doesn't that just embolden them to do this?
[03:08:57.722 --> 03:09:23.780]  Of course, and that gives them the... because when Antifa does their main attack next, the American public will be A, desensitized, and so the next attack will be everybody will say, oh no, more fake bombs, and then the next one's gonna be a real one that actually does hurt something, and then the CNN will come out and say, oh, thank God for Antifa, they're defending us because we got the bombs first, and now Antifa's on our side.
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:26.842]  They're our great defenders of American freedom.
[03:09:29.286 --> 03:09:41.550]  But, um, looking at the ABC put out, um, I'm looking at the picture right now, they put out the picture of the x-ray that, uh, whomever, you know, the bomb squad put out, and it's 100% a fake thing.
[03:09:41.550 --> 03:09:43.551]  There's no blasting cap.
[03:09:43.551 --> 03:09:45.792]  There's no batteries.
[03:09:45.792 --> 03:09:54.795]  If you look at the picture of the, um, of the clock, they didn't even remove the film that has the fake numbers on top of it.
[03:09:54.795 --> 03:09:57.856]  So it says 1135, and you can see numbers underneath.
[03:09:58.959 --> 03:10:05.718]  There's no way this thing is, uh... Well, plus it's not gonna blow up when it's a light... It's not even PVC pipe now, it's like just plastic.
[03:10:05.718 --> 03:10:06.240]  Exactly.
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:07.042]  So they created...
[03:10:08.470 --> 03:10:14.771]  A fiction, and then mailed it to actors who could then bitch and complain how they're poor victims while they call for violence.
[03:10:14.771 --> 03:10:24.553]  And so, I mean, look, I'm no bomb maker, but I know, you know, you get the pipe, you put in the best powder you can get, you don't want black powder, you want regular accelerant powder, modern white powder.
[03:10:24.553 --> 03:10:36.496]  You pack it in, you put projectiles in it, and then you screw the caps on as tightly as possible with a wire going through that's got two, you know, two points that connect so that when the clock
[03:10:37.016 --> 03:10:40.238]  It sends an electric charge through that detonates the powder.
[03:10:40.238 --> 03:10:42.520]  I mean, and it doesn't have any of that.
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:46.622]  In fact, they're even admitting now there's not even powder in the damn thing.
[03:10:46.622 --> 03:10:51.585]  Alex, that description right there is probably what, you know, majority of people, that's not even accurate.
[03:10:51.585 --> 03:10:54.087]  Because you have to have something that'll detonate.
[03:10:54.087 --> 03:10:56.448]  You need a primary, like a blasting cap.
[03:10:56.448 --> 03:10:58.249]  Wires heating up will not be hot.
[03:10:58.249 --> 03:11:00.891]  I was about to say, you gotta have wires heating up going to a cap.
[03:11:01.570 --> 03:11:02.250]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:11:02.250 --> 03:11:04.111]  And then there's nothing exposed here.
[03:11:04.111 --> 03:11:11.473]  The red wire on one side and the black wire on one side, that's just somebody watching a movie and thinking they're going to rig something.
[03:11:11.473 --> 03:11:23.898]  So, I look at a picture, and another thing real fast, the picture that they put out of, it's pulled out on the desk with the Clorox, with the Clorox container right there.
[03:11:23.898 --> 03:11:26.639]  That looks like somebody pulled it out of the package,
[03:11:28.066 --> 03:11:32.927]  I took a picture and apparently it wasn't that much of a threat that they needed to run away as fast as they can.
[03:11:32.927 --> 03:11:35.308]  Like, ah, I can take a picture real fast and get super famous.
[03:11:35.308 --> 03:11:35.868]  No, exactly.
[03:11:35.868 --> 03:11:37.149]  A real bomb you're scared of.
[03:11:37.149 --> 03:11:37.829]  None of them went off.
[03:11:37.829 --> 03:11:38.529]  It's totally fake.
[03:11:38.529 --> 03:11:39.029]  God bless you.
[03:11:39.029 --> 03:11:39.789]  Good to hear from you, Ethan.
[03:11:39.789 --> 03:11:40.850]  Great points.
[03:11:40.850 --> 03:11:42.470]  Okay, who's been holding the longest now?
[03:11:42.470 --> 03:11:44.030]  Steve in Michigan.
[03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:47.071]  As a former Marine or Marine wants to talk about bombing.
[03:11:47.071 --> 03:11:47.371]  Go ahead.
[03:11:47.371 --> 03:11:49.592]  What's your view on this?
[03:11:49.592 --> 03:11:50.372]  Hi, Alex.
[03:11:50.372 --> 03:11:52.673]  Doing a great job.
[03:11:52.673 --> 03:11:53.753]  Appreciate everything you do.
[03:11:53.753 --> 03:11:54.573]  Appreciate you.
[03:11:54.573 --> 03:11:56.014]  We're going to do our parts.
[03:11:57.345 --> 03:12:00.367]  The first thing I was thinking was this is nonsensical and that's good.
[03:12:00.367 --> 03:12:08.052]  What that tells us is that this is a organized act of desperation.
[03:12:08.052 --> 03:12:12.275]  So that tells us a red tsunami is coming.
[03:12:12.275 --> 03:12:13.136]  No, I agree.
[03:12:13.136 --> 03:12:15.918]  This is really desperate and really pathetic.
[03:12:15.918 --> 03:12:18.439]  And it shows they don't have command and control anymore.
[03:12:18.439 --> 03:12:20.721]  So they came up with something like this.
[03:12:22.279 --> 03:12:23.841]  Absolutely.
[03:12:23.841 --> 03:12:34.675]  The thing that bothers me is that when those things happen, what we saw overseas is that they would have time for opportunity, which start to pick up.
[03:12:34.675 --> 03:12:37.699]  So the small things would happen.
[03:12:37.699 --> 03:12:39.722]  Senator Cruz and his wife, things would happen.
[03:12:40.945 --> 03:12:41.525]  I don't know.
[03:13:01.314 --> 03:13:03.615]  The deepest thing I ever did was become shallow.
[03:13:03.615 --> 03:13:06.436]  Well, that's very Zen, what he said.
[03:13:06.436 --> 03:13:14.560]  Your first approximation is your full subconscious, a hundred times on average more powerful than conscious, so your first approximation is what's going to happen.
[03:13:14.560 --> 03:13:19.042]  What is your first approximation of what they're going to try in the next 12 days?
[03:13:19.042 --> 03:13:20.402]  Well, they're punching the wrong dog.
[03:13:20.402 --> 03:13:23.784]  I think, and by dog I mean all of us.
[03:13:24.452 --> 03:13:26.814]  And I think they're going to try the small things.
[03:13:26.814 --> 03:13:30.438]  I think they're going to go after the mom with the MAGA hats.
[03:13:30.438 --> 03:13:31.839]  I think those are the people.
[03:13:31.839 --> 03:13:36.623]  So you think just low-intensity voter intimidation and rage?
[03:13:36.623 --> 03:13:38.004]  Absolutely.
[03:13:38.004 --> 03:13:40.727]  I think that's going to affect them dramatically.
[03:13:42.059 --> 03:13:43.160]  God bless you, Steve.
[03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:44.161]  Go ahead.
[03:13:44.161 --> 03:13:44.782]  Absolutely.
[03:13:44.782 --> 03:13:47.624]  Go ahead.
[03:13:47.624 --> 03:13:50.827]  The people, there's 17 people that still watch CNN.
[03:13:50.827 --> 03:13:58.654]  It just blows my mind how little respect CNN, MSNBC, all these other people have for their viewers.
[03:13:58.654 --> 03:14:00.676]  Because these things are, they're stupid.
[03:14:00.676 --> 03:14:04.079]  These are the things that when we would see them on the road, we would ignore them.
[03:14:04.079 --> 03:14:05.941]  We'd say, okay, well what else is going on?
[03:14:06.570 --> 03:14:09.492]  They put this out there to draw our attention.
[03:14:09.492 --> 03:14:10.893]  So what else is going on?
[03:14:10.893 --> 03:14:12.293]  They don't want us to see.
[03:14:12.293 --> 03:14:18.797]  And that's my concern is if they're using classic, you know, Islamic, that's exactly what I was saying yesterday.
[03:14:18.797 --> 03:14:20.238]  You see little fake pipe bombs.
[03:14:20.238 --> 03:14:20.939]  That's a distraction.
[03:14:20.939 --> 03:14:25.941]  It's that pile over there on the side of the road that's about to shoot that, you know, projectile weapon at you.
[03:14:25.941 --> 03:14:27.502]  So God bless you, Steve.
[03:14:27.502 --> 03:14:29.263]  So, yeah, we're not out of the woods yet, folks.
[03:14:29.263 --> 03:14:29.744]  12 days out.
[03:14:29.744 --> 03:14:31.685]  We got to be really focusing.
[03:14:31.685 --> 03:14:33.026]  They're trying economic collapse.
[03:14:34.178 --> 03:14:37.760]  They are trying the whole collapse of our borders.
[03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:42.562]  They're pulling this to make themselves victims, to cast themselves as victims.
[03:14:42.562 --> 03:14:44.983]  They're really sophisticated before something really big hits.
[03:14:44.983 --> 03:14:46.304]  But I don't know.
[03:14:46.304 --> 03:14:47.884]  I don't want to be smarter than they are.
[03:14:47.884 --> 03:14:50.425]  I have to get down on their mindset sometimes.
[03:14:50.425 --> 03:14:56.668]  I have to imagine I've got two brain tumors and I'm totally evil.
[03:14:56.668 --> 03:14:59.109]  And I'm a handmaiden for child molesters like Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:59.109 --> 03:15:02.071]  I've got to get in her mindset and it's not a pretty place.
[03:15:03.376 --> 03:15:04.817]  That's when I really come up with my good ideas, though.
[03:15:04.817 --> 03:15:13.862]  I've got to go sitting around for like five hours and just really think about scum and how they operate and like get in their mindset and it's... I'll be honest, it's one of the places I've failed.
[03:15:13.862 --> 03:15:15.283]  I just... I don't like it.
[03:15:15.283 --> 03:15:23.008]  I can do it really good, but I have to get in the enemy mindset and I don't like it, but... I think I have to do it.
[03:15:23.008 --> 03:15:26.790]  And it's... I feel sorry for myself, but I'm not looking forward to it.
[03:15:26.790 --> 03:15:30.132]  I have to really get in their mindset.
[03:15:30.132 --> 03:15:31.173]  What are they going to do next?
[03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:35.191]  I just think they repeat themselves.
[03:15:35.191 --> 03:15:40.896]  I think it's a truck bomb on a major media outlet, a fake media outlet, and, uh, blaming us.
[03:15:40.896 --> 03:15:43.258]  I think they're gonna roll a truck bomb in.
[03:15:43.258 --> 03:15:46.461]  That's just my, just, my subconscious says, roll a truck bomb in.
[03:15:46.461 --> 03:15:50.624]  And we're trying to stop that right now, but I think they've got the truck bombs loaded.
[03:15:50.624 --> 03:15:52.246]  Hell, they may blow up ten truck bombs.
[03:15:53.641 --> 03:15:54.861]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.861 --> 03:16:00.243]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.243 --> 03:16:03.123]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.123 --> 03:16:06.724]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[03:16:54.646 --> 03:16:58.570]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.570 --> 03:17:00.111]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:00.111 --> 03:17:03.074]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.

[03:19:56.678 --> 03:20:11.731]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:11.731 --> 03:20:15.754]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:20:15.754 --> 03:20:20.898]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.898 --> 03:20:23.861]  You know, I was thinking today before I go back to your calls and Roger Stone's taking over.
[03:20:25.069 --> 03:20:27.730]  I was thinking about what do I stand for?
[03:20:27.730 --> 03:20:29.611]  You know, I'm not suicidal.
[03:20:29.611 --> 03:20:33.392]  I love life.
[03:20:33.392 --> 03:20:44.537]  But if I had to walk into a furnace that I knew was going to be turned on and was going to burn me to death in five minutes for my children and for your children, I would do it.
[03:20:44.537 --> 03:20:46.798]  And that's what a man is.
[03:20:46.798 --> 03:20:47.898]  We like to have fun.
[03:20:47.898 --> 03:20:49.719]  We want to live to be 100 years old.
[03:20:49.719 --> 03:20:52.580]  But if we got to die, we're going to do it.
[03:20:52.580 --> 03:20:54.441]  But you got to make sure you die on the right thing.
[03:20:56.926 --> 03:21:01.248]  And it's so liberating to not be afraid of the globalists.
[03:21:01.248 --> 03:21:03.990]  It's so liberating to know we're on the right path and to be close to God.
[03:21:03.990 --> 03:21:11.114]  And it's so liberating to know whatever the costs are, we're gonna pay them.
[03:21:11.114 --> 03:21:16.637]  And to see the return of men and the return of women.
[03:21:16.637 --> 03:21:21.840]  That's why that's all, everything they do is to attack that because of the power it has.
[03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:24.922]  The Dow surged 500 points to reverse the downward spiral today.
[03:21:26.849 --> 03:21:31.531]  Vox Magazine asks, is it time to start adding lithium to the water to make us all submit?
[03:21:31.531 --> 03:21:34.292]  They already added it, by the way, folks.
[03:21:34.292 --> 03:21:35.433]  That's on Infowars.com.
[03:21:35.433 --> 03:21:37.233]  That's how sick all this is.
[03:21:37.233 --> 03:21:39.394]  See, they don't deny all this anymore.
[03:21:39.394 --> 03:21:42.075]  They admit it.
[03:21:42.075 --> 03:21:43.036]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[03:21:43.036 --> 03:21:44.777]  We're taking your calls right now.
[03:21:44.777 --> 03:21:45.157]  Riley!
[03:21:46.152 --> 03:21:51.094]  Riley, in the great state of Texas, Air Force Civil Engineer, wants to talk about the bombings.
[03:21:51.094 --> 03:21:56.677]  Every expert we've had on, and experts on CNN, MSNBC, FOX say these are fake bombs.
[03:21:56.677 --> 03:21:59.899]  But it's like background noise, and then attacks.
[03:21:59.899 --> 03:22:02.960]  Jones says they're fake, he's a kook.
[03:22:02.960 --> 03:22:05.421]  But he's behind the bombings.
[03:22:05.421 --> 03:22:07.722]  So, it's a crazy time.
[03:22:07.722 --> 03:22:08.503]  Riley, what do you think?
[03:22:10.459 --> 03:22:18.045]  Yeah, you know, I'm just sitting here laughing at how everyone discussed the psychological operations that I pretty much created, not but a couple days ago.
[03:22:18.045 --> 03:22:27.232]  So, metaphysically, everyone's arguing about, you know, the Orange Naro effect, and how it's perfectly designed to work the way it's supposed to work.
[03:22:27.232 --> 03:22:29.754]  Designed to show how much of a fraud everyone is.
[03:22:29.754 --> 03:22:32.195]  Designed to show how fake everyone is.
[03:22:32.195 --> 03:22:39.581]  You realize, like, anyone in the Air Force and the Civil Engineering Squadron who pays attention to their training can do the same thing as an EOD personnel?
[03:22:40.091 --> 03:22:45.214]  It's just that the EODs are the brats of the military because their generals let them down and they complain the most.
[03:22:45.214 --> 03:22:48.875]  It really is beyond... So quantify, quantify.
[03:22:48.875 --> 03:22:52.897]  You're saying this false flag's meant to look like it's fake?
[03:22:52.897 --> 03:22:53.598]  Yes.
[03:22:53.598 --> 03:22:57.920]  If you go look at my video, the Orange Naro Effect, which I made for your NPC... Say it slow.
[03:22:57.920 --> 03:22:58.300]  Say it slow.
[03:22:58.300 --> 03:23:00.121]  We're gonna do the... I'm gonna announce the NPC soon.
[03:23:00.121 --> 03:23:02.362]  We got so many, we're trying to watch them all.
[03:23:02.362 --> 03:23:04.103]  It's called the what?
[03:23:04.103 --> 03:23:07.385]  It's called the Orange Naro Effect.
[03:23:07.385 --> 03:23:09.546]  The Orange... The Orange Naro?
[03:23:10.586 --> 03:23:13.828]  Yeah, it's like, you've seen the Netflix show, The Cabanaro Effect?
[03:23:13.828 --> 03:23:15.410]  No.
[03:23:15.410 --> 03:23:17.431]  Okay, well... I don't have time for a lot of entertainment.
[03:23:17.431 --> 03:23:25.237]  Seriously, I mean, like, I may watch one show a week, so... The last thing I watched on TV was, uh, was, uh, First Man.
[03:23:25.237 --> 03:23:25.877]  It was excellent.
[03:23:25.877 --> 03:23:27.719]  That was, like, two weeks ago.
[03:23:27.719 --> 03:23:31.862]  So tell me again, The Orange Naro Effect?
[03:23:31.862 --> 03:23:34.524]  Yeah, it's just, it's a play on words, because what I'm doing is,
[03:23:34.949 --> 03:23:48.579]  You create an object, you create like an idol, you create a device, and you get people to worship, you get people to contemplate, you get them to surround their thought process around that thing, until it just corrupts themselves.
[03:23:48.579 --> 03:23:53.862]  Alright, so we're showing it, so quantify what you're saying.
[03:23:53.862 --> 03:23:59.086]  Okay, you know, it's just a deep psychological operation, just to prove how much of fraud everyone is.
[03:23:59.793 --> 03:24:04.395]  That's it, because you have people out there claiming to be experts, claiming to be this, claiming to be that.
[03:24:04.395 --> 03:24:06.736]  Notice all the claiming over this device.
[03:24:06.736 --> 03:24:09.318]  Well, I don't think, I think there's a... Listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:24:09.318 --> 03:24:18.222]  I don't think there's a... I don't think there's a claim, there's real experts, this is fake, plastic stuff, it's all fake, it's blowing up.
[03:24:18.222 --> 03:24:19.503]  Why are the globalists so stupid?
[03:24:19.503 --> 03:24:20.663]  I think that's the issue.
[03:24:20.663 --> 03:24:25.406]  To get caught in, oh, there's nothing real, oh, it's all fake, everything's someone else's shy-op.
[03:24:25.406 --> 03:24:27.467]  Everything in the universe is intention, my friend.
[03:24:28.937 --> 03:24:34.578]  I intend to try to work with you to build a better world for our children.
[03:24:34.578 --> 03:24:37.739]  I intend to be honest and have a world where that's honored.
[03:24:37.739 --> 03:24:39.059]  I'm real.
[03:24:39.059 --> 03:24:43.620]  And so they can say whatever they want in the universe that I'm Bill Hicks or I'm this or that, I'm not.
[03:24:43.620 --> 03:24:44.440]  I'm real.
[03:24:44.440 --> 03:24:52.762]  I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones from Dallas, Texas, and I love freedom, and I'm gonna stand up against them.
[03:24:52.762 --> 03:24:54.203]  So there you go.
[03:24:54.203 --> 03:24:55.483]  Okay, another caller here.
[03:24:56.892 --> 03:24:57.793]  Curtis in Oregon.
[03:24:57.793 --> 03:24:58.293]  You're on the air.
[03:24:58.293 --> 03:24:58.594]  Go ahead.
[03:24:58.594 --> 03:25:01.537]  Thanks for rolling.
[03:25:01.537 --> 03:25:02.458]  Alex, can you hear me?
[03:25:02.458 --> 03:25:02.798]  Yes, sir.
[03:25:02.798 --> 03:25:04.099]  You say Army EOD.
[03:25:04.099 --> 03:25:05.361]  I want to comment on the bombings.
[03:25:05.361 --> 03:25:07.643]  Please give us your take.
[03:25:07.643 --> 03:25:08.044]  Yes, sir.
[03:25:08.044 --> 03:25:10.106]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:25:10.106 --> 03:25:18.054]  Listen, when you run your vendor safe procedure on these devices, you know within the hour after you get your samples back,
[03:25:18.678 --> 03:25:20.398]  Whether or not there was explosives.
[03:25:20.398 --> 03:25:24.039]  I'm trying to juggle around and say, oh, it may have been an explosive.
[03:25:24.039 --> 03:25:24.519]  It may not.
[03:25:24.519 --> 03:25:25.599]  They already know.
[03:25:25.599 --> 03:25:26.059]  Exactly.
[03:25:26.059 --> 03:25:28.780]  Two days later, they're not sure if it's explosives.
[03:25:28.780 --> 03:25:30.180]  That's that's key.
[03:25:30.180 --> 03:25:33.281]  Then they're not there's not even black powder.
[03:25:33.281 --> 03:25:34.201]  It's laughable.
[03:25:34.201 --> 03:25:35.401]  It's totally laughable.
[03:25:35.401 --> 03:25:43.502]  I mean, I mean, wouldn't they have a test in like 30 seconds to know if it was explosive and then like a what a two hour test, right?
[03:25:43.502 --> 03:25:43.902]  Absolutely.
[03:25:43.902 --> 03:25:45.383]  It's not even that, Alex.
[03:25:45.383 --> 03:25:46.763]  I've used the device myself.
[03:25:46.763 --> 03:25:47.263]  You put the
[03:25:47.924 --> 03:25:53.867]  You put what it is in a little glass tube, put it in the device, it fires a laser through it, it'll tell you exactly what it is.
[03:25:53.867 --> 03:25:54.887]  So it's a spectrometer?
[03:25:54.887 --> 03:25:56.248]  It takes five minutes.
[03:25:56.248 --> 03:25:59.109]  Yeah, it takes five minutes, Alex.
[03:25:59.109 --> 03:26:00.990]  It's totally laughable.
[03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.410]  No, I agree.
[03:26:01.410 --> 03:26:08.133]  To get the general family's five minutes, I was reading this last night, but to get the exact, you know, total breakdown on it, maybe a few hours.
[03:26:08.133 --> 03:26:12.015]  So, they know this is horse crap because you haven't seen what the explosive is.
[03:26:13.792 --> 03:26:16.434]  Oh yeah, this is faker than the Kavanaugh accusation.
[03:26:16.434 --> 03:26:17.575]  This is just laughable.
[03:26:17.575 --> 03:26:20.878]  Those devices might as well have been dog toys.
[03:26:20.878 --> 03:26:21.659]  I mean... I agree.
[03:26:21.659 --> 03:26:23.841]  So let me ask you this, Curtis.
[03:26:23.841 --> 03:26:25.022]  What are they going to pull next?
[03:26:25.022 --> 03:26:28.205]  Because they sure as hell aren't giving up.
[03:26:28.205 --> 03:26:30.026]  Man, it's hard to say right now.
[03:26:30.026 --> 03:26:36.172]  I mean, obviously they can't get any real bomb makers to do anything for them.
[03:26:36.172 --> 03:26:39.735]  You know, I think this is a multi-layer attack from multiple angles.
[03:26:40.553 --> 03:26:44.936]  And I think it's more of a distraction away from that invasion coming from the South.
[03:26:44.936 --> 03:26:45.657]  I agree.
[03:26:45.657 --> 03:26:50.420]  This is all a distraction from the Southern invasion.
[03:26:50.420 --> 03:26:51.261]  Exactly.
[03:26:51.261 --> 03:26:52.542]  They don't want us looking at that.
[03:26:52.542 --> 03:26:55.484]  They want everyone to be scared to go to the polls.
[03:26:55.484 --> 03:26:57.565]  Oh, I might get hit by a bomb there.
[03:26:57.565 --> 03:26:58.346]  Oh, you never know.
[03:26:58.346 --> 03:27:00.948]  Like, some right-winger might bomb me.
[03:27:00.948 --> 03:27:02.649]  It's ridiculous.
[03:27:02.649 --> 03:27:07.192]  Don't let ourselves be too distracted by what's coming from the South.
[03:27:07.192 --> 03:27:08.954]  No, I totally agree with you, Curtis.
[03:27:11.010 --> 03:27:14.279]  That Mexico is aiding and abetting an invasion of our country.
[03:27:14.873 --> 03:27:17.094]  And I mean, maybe I'm wrong.
[03:27:17.094 --> 03:27:17.455]  No, no.
[03:27:17.455 --> 03:27:20.056]  Their president admits they're doing it in July.
[03:27:20.056 --> 03:27:20.917]  Great points, Curtis.
[03:27:20.917 --> 03:27:21.277]  Thank you.
[03:27:21.277 --> 03:27:38.087]  We're going to put this out as a video because this is so important at Infowars.com that the pipe bomb attacks are a hoax to distract from the Islamic globalist whole UN invasion that's taking place.
[03:27:38.087 --> 03:27:38.867]  Great points.
[03:27:38.867 --> 03:27:41.489]  Let's jam in one more before Roger Stone comes up.
[03:27:41.489 --> 03:27:42.790]  Chris, Army
[03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:47.012]  Sent to border 1996, also on bombs.
[03:27:47.012 --> 03:27:49.032]  Go ahead.
[03:27:49.032 --> 03:27:50.633]  Oh, hey Alex.
[03:27:50.633 --> 03:27:55.455]  I served in the 17th Air Cavalry, 82nd Airborne Division from 94 to 97.
[03:27:55.455 --> 03:28:04.259]  And back in 1996, Bill Clinton, if you listen to his State of the Union Address, he sounds just like Donald Trump.
[03:28:04.259 --> 03:28:07.481]  But right after that, he sent my unit to the border.
[03:28:07.481 --> 03:28:10.022]  We went to El Centro Naval Air Facility.
[03:28:10.876 --> 03:28:11.136]  I'm good.
[03:28:27.094 --> 03:28:33.781]  Oh sure, the idea that the military, not just the Army, the Marine Corps hasn't been on the border forever is ridiculous.
[03:28:33.781 --> 03:28:35.383]  It's a constitutional role.
[03:28:35.383 --> 03:28:39.547]  You heard Osi O'Donnell like, we need martial law because he's sending troops to the border.
[03:28:39.547 --> 03:28:41.569]  That's in the Constitution.
[03:28:41.569 --> 03:28:42.871]  Finish up, Chris, when we come back.
[03:28:42.871 --> 03:28:44.072]  Then Roger Stone's taking over.
[03:28:44.072 --> 03:28:49.618]  And he's also going to be on The War Room today, 3 o'clock central, in about 30 minutes from now.
[03:28:53.217 --> 03:28:56.799]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.799 --> 03:29:00.381]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.381 --> 03:29:02.502]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[03:29:02.502 --> 03:29:04.543]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?

[03:29:54.366 --> 03:29:58.608]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:29:58.608 --> 03:30:02.090]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:30:02.090 --> 03:30:03.851]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:30:03.851 --> 03:30:07.132]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:30:07.132 --> 03:30:13.915]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:30:13.915 --> 03:30:18.998]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[03:30:19.318 --> 03:30:25.443]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:30:25.443 --> 03:30:28.425]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:30:28.425 --> 03:30:29.526]  I want to keep going.
[03:30:29.526 --> 03:30:33.349]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:35.351]  I want to push all the way.
[03:30:35.351 --> 03:30:36.652]  I've committed to do that.
[03:30:36.652 --> 03:30:37.733]  I've prayed for that.
[03:30:37.733 --> 03:30:39.374]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:30:39.374 --> 03:30:41.816]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:30:42.296 --> 03:30:43.617]  I will never falter.
[03:30:43.617 --> 03:30:45.959]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:30:45.959 --> 03:30:46.900]  I physically will.
[03:30:46.900 --> 03:30:53.986]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and fullwrestler.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:30:53.986 --> 03:31:02.374]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:31:02.374 --> 03:31:03.855]  Believe me, I know.
[03:31:03.855 --> 03:31:07.198]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights.
[03:31:07.558 --> 03:31:08.519]  Every day.
[03:31:08.519 --> 03:31:13.781]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:31:13.781 --> 03:31:33.932]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:31:34.432 --> 03:31:38.413]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:31:38.413 --> 03:31:42.094]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:31:42.094 --> 03:31:47.096]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:31:47.096 --> 03:31:49.837]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:31:49.837 --> 03:31:53.878]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:53.878 --> 03:31:57.779]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:31:59.122 --> 03:32:07.812]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:32:07.812 --> 03:32:09.815]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:32:09.815 --> 03:32:13.259]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:32:13.259 --> 03:32:15.882]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:32:15.882 --> 03:32:17.443]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:32:18.144 --> 03:32:30.542]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[03:32:31.744 --> 03:32:35.446]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:32:35.446 --> 03:32:36.627]  We'll win.
[03:32:36.627 --> 03:32:39.548]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:32:39.548 --> 03:32:44.851]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[03:32:44.851 --> 03:32:46.692]  And you're right, to the market.
[03:32:46.692 --> 03:32:50.374]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:32:50.374 --> 03:32:51.935]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:32:51.935 --> 03:32:52.636]  We need your support.
[03:32:52.636 --> 03:32:57.598]  I'm counting on you.
[03:32:57.598 --> 03:33:00.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.350 --> 03:33:29.472]  All right, it is 2.33 Central Time.
[03:33:29.472 --> 03:33:34.376]  The War Room's coming up with Roger Stone and Orrin Schroer in about 27 minutes.
[03:33:34.376 --> 03:33:36.278]  And look, I like Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[03:33:36.278 --> 03:33:39.461]  I've been interviewing him for 18, 19 years.
[03:33:39.461 --> 03:33:44.445]  He exposed globalism, really helped Lou Dobbs do a lot of his work when he was at CNN.
[03:33:44.445 --> 03:33:49.669]  But I gotta be honest with you, without saying too much, when I was in D.C.
[03:33:49.669 --> 03:33:54.594]  about six months ago with Dr. Corsi, he seemed to
[03:33:56.320 --> 03:34:02.824]  Mentally be extremely degraded to the point of what I would call dimension.
[03:34:02.824 --> 03:34:08.927]  And you know, I respected him when he liked QAnon, then he said QAnon's bad, and then I agreed with him, and then all that didn't get proven.
[03:34:08.927 --> 03:34:15.351]  I'm not throwing Corsi under the bus here, but Corsi won't even return my phone calls.
[03:34:15.351 --> 03:34:24.737]  And the last time I saw him, I was in a steakhouse in D.C., not even knowing he was there, he walks in, eats by himself, and then falls down on the ground.
[03:34:26.587 --> 03:34:29.110]  And I had five security people with me.
[03:34:29.110 --> 03:34:31.032]  We were staying at a hotel next to his, I guess.
[03:34:31.032 --> 03:34:32.454]  They took him back.
[03:34:32.454 --> 03:34:35.778]  They thought he was dead at one point.
[03:34:35.778 --> 03:34:37.540]  And folks, you know, I only say what's true.
[03:34:37.540 --> 03:34:40.103]  I have all the witnesses that have them.
[03:34:40.103 --> 03:34:43.186]  And it was at that point, he was a contract writer for InfoWars.
[03:34:43.186 --> 03:34:44.308]  I let him go the next week.
[03:34:45.919 --> 03:34:49.341]  And I just said, hey, thanks for your services.
[03:34:49.341 --> 03:34:51.982]  His one-year contract just so happened to be ending in about a month.
[03:34:51.982 --> 03:34:56.124]  I paid out the last month of it, and that was the last I saw of Corsi.
[03:34:56.124 --> 03:35:01.527]  Next, Mueller calls him in, and now we're here.
[03:35:01.527 --> 03:35:03.868]  So I don't want to say these things on air, but you know what?
[03:35:03.868 --> 03:35:04.789]  The truth's the truth.
[03:35:04.789 --> 03:35:05.229]  I'll say it.
[03:35:06.792 --> 03:35:12.114]  I'm sitting there eating a steak, drinking red wine, and he's on the ground at another table.
[03:35:12.114 --> 03:35:13.714]  We had to help him out of there, man.
[03:35:13.714 --> 03:35:15.615]  They thought he was dead in the elevator.
[03:35:15.615 --> 03:35:20.417]  In fact, these were former, these were actually current Navy SEALs, Delta Force, you name it.
[03:35:20.417 --> 03:35:21.717]  They were like about to call an ambulance.
[03:35:21.717 --> 03:35:22.778]  They thought his heart stopped.
[03:35:22.778 --> 03:35:26.919]  They were like listening to his chest, and then it came back, and then they had to carry him to his hotel.
[03:35:26.919 --> 03:35:29.680]  So, that happened on my shelter.
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:31.321]  I'm not discrediting Corsi.
[03:35:31.321 --> 03:35:32.181]  I'm telling you what happened.
[03:35:34.229 --> 03:35:37.050]  So I think he's got dementia or a stroke.
[03:35:37.050 --> 03:35:39.212]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:35:39.212 --> 03:35:43.034]  So, he's a really sharp brain up until about a year ago.
[03:35:43.034 --> 03:35:47.056]  Mueller subpoenas Jerome Corsi Berther, an ex-Alex Jones associate.
[03:35:47.056 --> 03:35:54.880]  Mueller reportedly has evidence that Roger Stone Associate, new Clinton campaign emails have been stolen and given to Wikileaks.
[03:35:54.880 --> 03:35:59.142]  Evidence Stone Associate knew of Clinton emailing.
[03:35:59.142 --> 03:36:00.903]  Now folks, this is why this is so crazy.
[03:36:02.111 --> 03:36:08.976]  I was there in June, July, August, before Roger Stone was working with InfoWars.
[03:36:08.976 --> 03:36:11.838]  He was a Fox News consultant to him, and so was Corsi.
[03:36:11.838 --> 03:36:14.660]  I've just got consultants working here.
[03:36:14.660 --> 03:36:17.302]  These are great sources, and I'm sitting there
[03:36:19.400 --> 03:36:41.468]  And I'm talking to Roger Stone, because, you know, WikiLeaks, Julian Assange is on Fox News, he's in CNN, he's on New York Times videos, and I said, you know, he needs to come on my show, we're exposing all this, and I called him a Hillary butt plug and all that, because he wouldn't, and I'm talking to Stone, I'm talking to Corsi, and they're like, yeah, we're trying to get journalists that are talking to him to get questions.
[03:36:41.468 --> 03:36:43.849]  Everyone wanted to know what the WikiLeaks were.
[03:36:43.849 --> 03:36:44.810]  Everyone did.
[03:36:44.810 --> 03:36:47.591]  And so we'd say, oh, we hear it really hurts Clinton, because
[03:36:48.578 --> 03:36:50.459]  WikiLeaks had said it was about Clinton.
[03:36:50.459 --> 03:37:03.446]  And Stone had talked to that talk show host in New York, I forget his name, we'll say his name in a minute, that on record did know Assange, who's now being flushed down the toilet and Ecuadorian embassies not giving him support.
[03:37:03.446 --> 03:37:14.933]  So the idea that you're a Russian agent if you try to talk to Assange when he's all over mainstream news, and we never did, and now of course he says he's the source
[03:37:16.497 --> 03:37:27.464]  Of all this is just incredible, so I have to at this point, because my name's in all this, and of course he won't return my phone calls, I have to, because he was grabbed by Mueller for days.
[03:37:29.341 --> 03:37:33.064]  And I heard from somebody that saw him, like it was been beaten with phone books or something.
[03:37:33.064 --> 03:37:34.345]  I love Dr. Corsi.
[03:37:34.345 --> 03:37:35.105]  And people get old.
[03:37:35.105 --> 03:37:37.347]  Man, my grandfather was an amazing person.
[03:37:37.347 --> 03:37:43.632]  World War II vet, prospector, author, leasehound, oil guy, great guy.
[03:37:43.632 --> 03:37:46.794]  And you know, he was about 80 years old and he had a heart attack.
[03:37:46.794 --> 03:37:49.997]  And they fixed his heart, but it said a bunch of stuff to his brain.
[03:37:49.997 --> 03:37:53.359]  And I came back over to his house, you know, about a month after the surgery.
[03:37:53.359 --> 03:37:54.320]  And he was like a three-year-old.
[03:37:56.021 --> 03:38:02.627]  Telling me about red fire engines and, you know, you know, playing marbles and going poop in the potty.
[03:38:02.627 --> 03:38:08.151]  So, Mueller's got a guy talking about poop in the potty here.
[03:38:08.151 --> 03:38:16.438]  And we just have to say that, that if I'm ever senile or had a stroke or whatever's going on with Corsi, that whatever comes out of his mouth ain't the truth.
[03:38:16.438 --> 03:38:18.480]  So, uh, Roger Stone, I've done it.
[03:38:18.480 --> 03:38:19.080]  I've just said it.
[03:38:19.080 --> 03:38:20.501]  All I have is the truth.
[03:38:20.501 --> 03:38:22.043]  What the hell is going on here?
[03:38:22.043 --> 03:38:23.304]  Because they're reporting this everywhere.
[03:38:24.409 --> 03:38:26.752]  It's pretty simple, Alex.
[03:38:26.752 --> 03:38:33.338]  To be absolutely clear, there have been a spate of leaks from the Office of the Special Counsel.
[03:38:33.338 --> 03:38:38.463]  It is technically illegal for them to leak, but they have been leaking like a sieve.
[03:38:38.463 --> 03:38:46.952]  On the other hand, their leaks are oblique, such as Jerry Corsi learned of his own
[03:38:47.692 --> 03:38:50.315]  But I mean, he was on record on this show!
[03:38:50.315 --> 03:38:52.357]  WikiLeaks said we have their emails!
[03:39:09.744 --> 03:39:16.867]  But specifically in the question of John Podesta's emails, I have said... Roger, you don't have to repeat it.
[03:39:16.867 --> 03:39:23.789]  I remember hounding you, and the minute WikiLeaks would release stuff, we were all on the site to grab it and do the news.
[03:39:23.789 --> 03:39:29.191]  The idea that we were talking to Assange when he treated us like crap, I called him a butt plug!
[03:39:30.323 --> 03:39:44.912]  But in this specific case, what is being alleged by NBC was that Corsi knew and had Podesta's emails in advance, can't remember where he got them, didn't get them from Assange, and that he passed them on to me.
[03:39:44.912 --> 03:39:48.114]  To be very clear, I never passed on anything.
[03:39:48.114 --> 03:39:52.597]  NBC says, quote, Stone said he only passed on documents that were public.
[03:39:52.597 --> 03:39:55.399]  No, actually, I never said I passed on anything.
[03:39:55.399 --> 03:39:57.200]  I just tweeted on things.
[03:39:57.200 --> 03:39:58.861]  So it's more fake news
[03:39:59.681 --> 03:40:00.042]  Nonsense.
[03:40:00.042 --> 03:40:02.144]  Sure, but let's say what you're guilty of.
[03:40:02.144 --> 03:40:05.668]  You're guilty, like I and everybody else, of hyping.
[03:40:05.668 --> 03:40:07.750]  Assange says this is going to be damning to Hillary.
[03:40:07.750 --> 03:40:09.973]  We're like, great, great, great, we're going to cover it.
[03:40:09.973 --> 03:40:13.236]  We did a live overnight broadcast and then Assange didn't release it and I got mad at him.
[03:40:13.236 --> 03:40:15.879]  I mean, it's just such a... I was there!
[03:40:15.879 --> 03:40:19.883]  And I'm not trying to put Corsi down, but the state I saw him in...
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:25.925]  And then even after that, a few phone calls before he wouldn't talk to me, was he's not there.
[03:40:25.925 --> 03:40:27.426]  And so I'm not being mean to Corsi.
[03:40:27.426 --> 03:40:28.907]  Maybe he's better now.
[03:40:28.907 --> 03:40:33.312]  But all I'm saying is, Roger, this is what Mueller hinges on now?
[03:40:34.853 --> 03:40:40.657]  It appears that he's going to put his eggs on this basket because Randy Credico is not a credible witness.
[03:40:40.657 --> 03:40:44.760]  He told me that Assange had this material and he would publish it in October.
[03:40:44.760 --> 03:40:47.763]  He told me that consistently for a 50-day period.
[03:40:47.763 --> 03:40:50.385]  There are third-party witnesses he said to.
[03:40:50.385 --> 03:40:51.406]  He's out of his mind.
[03:40:51.406 --> 03:40:52.847]  He's contradicting himself.
[03:40:52.847 --> 03:40:54.448]  That's the New York talk show host.
[03:40:54.448 --> 03:40:55.689]  The New York talk show host.
[03:40:55.689 --> 03:40:58.011]  Everything I've said about him under oath is accurate.
[03:40:58.491 --> 03:41:05.554]  In the case of Jerry Corsi, to be clear, NBC didn't include this on-the-record categorical denial.
[03:41:05.554 --> 03:41:13.537]  Jerry Corsi never told me that he was aware of the acquisition of John Podesta's emails and that he never passed anything of the sort on to me.
[03:41:13.537 --> 03:41:16.278]  They exclude that quote from their story.
[03:41:17.178 --> 03:41:20.520]  So, it's just more fake news, the other one.
[03:41:20.520 --> 03:41:25.583]  Roger Stone advocated a pardon for Assange, as if this is a secret.
[03:41:25.583 --> 03:41:28.745]  We spoke about it here at Infowars.
[03:41:28.745 --> 03:41:32.848]  We ran a petition to do it.
[03:41:34.307 --> 03:41:35.808]  I wrote about it for the Daily Caller.
[03:41:35.808 --> 03:41:37.370]  I wrote about it for InfoWars.
[03:41:37.370 --> 03:41:39.893]  I love how they always say what we do on air is like some secret.
[03:41:39.893 --> 03:41:43.136]  So listen, everybody's sick of Russiagate, but it's good to cover.
[03:41:43.136 --> 03:41:46.740]  What about Rosenstein a month ago telling Trump it's over and signals of that?
[03:41:46.740 --> 03:41:47.621]  Do you think that is BS?
[03:41:49.318 --> 03:42:02.951]  What's extraordinary, Alex, is that Rosenstein is being allowed to testify to the Congress behind closed doors with only the two senior members, two Republicans, two Democrats, and a stenographer.
[03:42:02.951 --> 03:42:10.559]  The other members of the committee are being denied the right to perform their sworn constitutional duty of oversight.
[03:42:11.039 --> 03:42:17.928]  Why is Mr. Rosenstein getting special treatment when everybody's supposed to be treated equally under the law?
[03:42:17.928 --> 03:42:25.477]  There's ample evidence that he offered, not jokingly, to wear a wire to entrap the President under the 25th Amendment.
[03:42:25.477 --> 03:42:28.401]  No, Ken Delaney of NBC, that's not a joke.
[03:42:29.076 --> 03:42:32.919]  And the New York Times story, I think, covers this with multiple sources.
[03:42:53.226 --> 03:42:57.171]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.171 --> 03:43:00.455]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:43:00.455 --> 03:43:06.724]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:06.724 --> 03:43:09.507]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:43:10.228 --> 03:43:14.050]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.050 --> 03:43:20.533]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.533 --> 03:43:25.496]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:26.229 --> 03:43:30.173]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:43:30.173 --> 03:43:37.359]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.359 --> 03:43:42.503]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.503 --> 03:43:48.288]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.288 --> 03:43:52.252]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.382 --> 03:43:58.246]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[03:46:57.186 --> 03:46:59.848]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:05.879 --> 03:47:08.803]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[03:47:08.803 --> 03:47:13.428]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[03:47:13.428 --> 03:47:16.472]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[03:47:17.867 --> 03:47:23.452]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[03:47:23.452 --> 03:47:27.696]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls, and in our minds.
[03:47:27.696 --> 03:47:29.998]  We have to be good.
[03:47:29.998 --> 03:47:30.839]  We have to be pure.
[03:47:30.839 --> 03:47:32.020]  We have to be strong.
[03:47:32.020 --> 03:47:33.841]  We have to build prosperity.
[03:47:33.841 --> 03:47:36.324]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together.
[03:47:37.799 --> 03:47:44.121]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail, who believed their divide and conquer would work.
[03:47:44.121 --> 03:47:52.224]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[03:47:52.224 --> 03:47:58.747]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[03:48:13.747 --> 03:48:14.548]  I'm 17, 76.
[03:48:14.548 --> 03:48:17.149]  You're a white male!
[03:48:17.149 --> 03:48:22.073]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:48:22.073 --> 03:48:23.633]  Move, bitch!
[03:48:23.633 --> 03:48:25.154]  Get out the way!
[03:48:25.154 --> 03:48:26.836]  So, what's happened is very clear.
[03:48:26.836 --> 03:48:38.403]  A very corrupt group of bureaucrats and intelligence agency people working with foreign governments hijacked the country, sold it out, all became billionaires, and now they're pissed that we don't want to live under them.
[03:48:39.585 --> 03:48:46.929]  And then Dr. Corcio, I think he's a great guy and a good guy, gets targeted in all this and you see mainstream media saying things that may be not even true.
[03:48:46.929 --> 03:48:54.114]  I was pointing out that I've seen him appearing to be ill from a stroke, whatever the case is, and I've been really worried about him.
[03:48:55.564 --> 03:49:00.766]  And I know, Roger, you're in the crosshairs of this, so you want to defend yourself all the time.
[03:49:00.766 --> 03:49:04.788]  I don't think anybody buys that you've talked to the Russians or that Assange is a Russian.
[03:49:04.788 --> 03:49:06.949]  Because you all act like, I didn't even talk to Assange!
[03:49:06.949 --> 03:49:11.310]  Which we didn't, because he was being a little establishment punk at the time.
[03:49:11.310 --> 03:49:12.611]  And now they've hung him out to dry.
[03:49:12.611 --> 03:49:15.412]  But they didn't because he was a Russian or we were a Russian.
[03:49:15.412 --> 03:49:17.453]  So, moving on past all that.
[03:49:20.313 --> 03:49:22.254]  I don't see them covering Mueller as much.
[03:49:22.254 --> 03:49:23.654]  I mean, the last few weeks there's been nothing.
[03:49:23.654 --> 03:49:33.477]  Now suddenly this thing, which shows they're going after people that, when I've seen them, you know, aren't doing too well physically or mentally.
[03:49:33.477 --> 03:49:40.819]  So, you know, at the end of the day, if they get me after I've had a stroke or something, and they get me saying I'm the Tooth Fairy, it doesn't matter.
[03:49:40.819 --> 03:49:45.440]  I mean, I don't think anyone buys that Trump's a Russian agent or that you or I at this point.
[03:49:47.335 --> 03:49:56.347]  If Terry Corsi knew in advance about the alleged hacking of the DNC and passed documents on to Donald Trump, I don't know about it.
[03:49:56.347 --> 03:50:03.637]  I know that I had no advance notice of the source of the content of any of the WikiLeaks disclosures, including those regarding John Podesta.
[03:50:04.017 --> 03:50:05.619]  I've said so under oath.
[03:50:05.619 --> 03:50:11.824]  Contrary to what Swalwell and Schiff say, my testimony is entirely accurate and truthful.
[03:50:11.824 --> 03:50:14.506]  And I will prove that if I am called upon to do so.
[03:50:14.506 --> 03:50:15.847]  But Alex, this is a plan.
[03:50:15.847 --> 03:50:17.548]  Let me make sure you understand the plan.
[03:50:17.548 --> 03:50:18.449]  Number one.
[03:50:18.449 --> 03:50:19.370]  Step one.
[03:50:19.370 --> 03:50:21.191]  Take down Alex Jones.
[03:50:21.191 --> 03:50:23.453]  Shut Infowars down.
[03:50:23.453 --> 03:50:25.075]  That's step one in their plan.
[03:50:25.075 --> 03:50:25.895]  Step two.
[03:50:25.895 --> 03:50:27.977]  Get Roger Stone out of the way.
[03:50:27.977 --> 03:50:29.078]  Step three.
[03:50:29.078 --> 03:50:32.441]  The House of Representatives, if controlled by the government... No, I agree that...
[03:50:33.308 --> 03:50:38.313]  They had to demonize silence and destroy us before something big happens.
[03:50:38.313 --> 03:50:45.000]  So even though we sit here and go, this is ridiculous, what is it they're planning in their whole crazy system?
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:46.302]  Absolutely clear.
[03:50:46.302 --> 03:50:48.204]  If they win the House of Representatives,
[03:50:48.763 --> 03:50:52.004]  They will vote articles of impeachment against the President.
[03:50:52.004 --> 03:50:53.744]  Forget Russia collusion.
[03:50:53.744 --> 03:51:04.286]  Other than trying to pursue me on some bogus charge based on something Jerry Corsi never told me or may not even know, they failed.
[03:51:04.286 --> 03:51:10.048]  So now the new argument will be the President sexually assaulted these 19 women from the 2016 campaign.
[03:51:11.688 --> 03:51:17.452]  They will have no evidence or no proof and no corroboration, but you've seen the dry run for this.
[03:51:17.452 --> 03:51:19.533]  You've seen the dress rehearsal.
[03:51:19.533 --> 03:51:21.134]  Sure, let's go back to Corsi.
[03:51:22.523 --> 03:51:25.425]  If you believe mainstream media, what they say, he's saying.
[03:51:25.425 --> 03:51:35.233]  He was told that Assange had stuff on Podesta, the head of the Hillary campaign, and gave it to you, which would mean you have perjured yourself to the Senate.
[03:51:35.233 --> 03:51:36.293]  That's totally new.
[03:51:36.293 --> 03:51:39.956]  He previously wrote all these articles saying that wasn't the case.
[03:51:39.956 --> 03:51:43.339]  So it's, it's, what, what the hell does that mean?
[03:51:44.232 --> 03:51:47.614]  It contradicts everything he has written and said here on InfoWars.
[03:51:47.614 --> 03:51:48.835]  It is not true.
[03:51:48.835 --> 03:51:55.820]  He never told me anything about the acquisition of Podesta's emails and he never passed on anything to me.
[03:51:55.820 --> 03:51:56.960]  But I was there!
[03:51:56.960 --> 03:51:59.802]  We were bitching that we couldn't get what they were.
[03:51:59.802 --> 03:52:01.043]  What's wrong with what we do?
[03:52:01.043 --> 03:52:01.984]  That's what journalists do!
[03:52:02.902 --> 03:52:22.283]  And as I have said, between the Breitbart piece on August 14th that pointed out that Tony Podesta was working with Paul Manafort for the same Ukrainian political party, and the Panama Papers dissertations about... No, look, you defend yourself to this audience, and it's like, they already know it, Roger.
[03:52:22.283 --> 03:52:25.146]  And look, I get why you defend yourself, but here's the thing.
[03:52:28.562 --> 03:52:41.229]  I don't see any of it flying, and I just feel bad for Corsi, and I have to point out that the times I've seen him, he looks very, very sick, so whatever comes out of him, I feel sorry for him, and I hope he gets help, because we care about Dr. Corsi, and Lord knows what he's been through.
[03:52:41.229 --> 03:52:45.671]  He's been a great patriot for this country, but I'd have to say what I've seen.
[03:52:45.671 --> 03:52:46.751]  Shifting gears.
[03:52:46.751 --> 03:52:47.752]  The pipe bombs.
[03:52:47.752 --> 03:52:50.673]  The immigrant caravans.
[03:52:50.673 --> 03:52:53.415]  It's like the Democratic Party is committing suicide in front of us.
[03:52:54.738 --> 03:52:57.943]  Well, this is all part of the same mosaic.
[03:52:57.943 --> 03:52:59.585]  They are hysterical.
[03:52:59.585 --> 03:53:10.622]  The only reason that someone would do this highly suspicious pipe bomb strategy is if they were reading polls that show that they are slipping, that they are losing.
[03:53:11.182 --> 03:53:13.623]  We predicted this right here on InfoWars.
[03:53:13.623 --> 03:53:23.107]  We told you there would be some big dramatic event just before the election that was staged to help defeat Donald Trump and the Republicans.
[03:53:23.107 --> 03:53:24.627]  Here it is.
[03:53:24.627 --> 03:53:27.889]  Meanwhile, they try to sidetrack me with this nonsense.
[03:53:27.889 --> 03:53:34.571]  I want to be in the main fight, talking about the caravan, talking about these pipe bombs.
[03:53:34.571 --> 03:53:37.693]  So, in a way, it's an attempt to get me off kilter.
[03:53:37.693 --> 03:53:38.573]  But I also know
[03:53:39.273 --> 03:53:45.599]  That in America, when people accuse you of things, if you do not respond to them, unfortunately, they assume you're guilty.
[03:53:45.599 --> 03:53:47.821]  No, no, I get to act like you're guilty.
[03:53:47.821 --> 03:53:57.069]  I just, you know, I was there when I had my whole crew sending emails to WikiLeaks going, hey, you go on New York Times, you go on CNN, come on us.
[03:53:57.069 --> 03:53:59.511]  And then I remember you, I remember going, Roger.
[03:54:00.427 --> 03:54:01.107]  Can you get it?
[03:54:01.107 --> 03:54:04.529]  Well, I've got a contact through New York.
[03:54:04.529 --> 03:54:06.029]  We're really pressuring to come on.
[03:54:06.029 --> 03:54:07.910]  I go, well, that'd be great.
[03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:11.051]  I mean, I remember you couldn't get a hold of him.
[03:54:11.051 --> 03:54:21.256]  So then the idea that we're lying and we're in the bed with Russians because we can't get the supposed Russian agent on is just horse manure.
[03:54:21.256 --> 03:54:24.677]  Roger Stone, you're going to be on during the war room coming up, aren't you?
[03:54:24.677 --> 03:54:25.758]  Yes, indeed.
[03:54:25.758 --> 03:54:28.859]  Look, the Democrats are really freaking out.
[03:54:29.420 --> 03:54:34.442]  You could tell Hillary Clinton was perfectly made up, coiffed and so on.
[03:54:34.442 --> 03:54:40.844]  I believe that the teleprompters were loaded before the story about the bombs even broke.
[03:54:40.844 --> 03:54:46.466]  This is such an obvious false flag, an obvious falsehood.
[03:54:46.466 --> 03:54:48.787]  Notice none of the bombs went off.
[03:54:49.187 --> 03:54:52.190]  Notice none of the... Sure, they're fake bombs, they're fake bombs.

[03:57:25.871 --> 03:57:27.352]  It's amazing.
[03:57:27.352 --> 03:57:28.832]  And Megyn Kelly just got fired.
[03:57:28.832 --> 03:57:30.773]  It's just a lot of crazy news.
[03:57:30.773 --> 03:57:35.154]  But whatever happens, pray for Infowars, because your prayers are what takes us over the top.
[03:57:35.154 --> 03:57:36.495]  I need your prayers.
[03:57:36.495 --> 03:57:38.676]  I don't just believe in them, I depend on them.

[03:57:42.981 --> 03:57:48.304]  They now know that InfoWars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[03:57:48.304 --> 03:57:50.385]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[03:57:50.385 --> 03:57:56.489]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, and to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[03:57:56.489 --> 03:57:57.409]  Come to their door.
[03:57:57.409 --> 03:57:58.890]  I'm death, and they know it.
[03:57:58.890 --> 03:58:00.031]  I'm death of their system.
[03:58:00.171 --> 03:58:15.483]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast, we'll be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products and we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history and it has got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products and we are hurting.
[03:58:15.623 --> 03:58:16.344]  I don't know.
[03:58:44.491 --> 03:58:48.733]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:58:48.733 --> 03:58:52.215]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:58:52.215 --> 03:58:53.976]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:58:53.976 --> 03:58:57.238]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:58:57.238 --> 03:59:04.022]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:59:04.022 --> 03:59:09.105]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[03:59:09.445 --> 03:59:15.547]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:59:15.547 --> 03:59:18.548]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:59:18.548 --> 03:59:19.629]  I want to keep going.
[03:59:19.629 --> 03:59:23.470]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:59:23.470 --> 03:59:25.471]  I want to push all the way.
[03:59:25.471 --> 03:59:26.771]  I've committed to do that.
[03:59:26.771 --> 03:59:29.492]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:59:29.492 --> 03:59:31.913]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:59:32.433 --> 03:59:33.735]  I will never falter.
[03:59:33.735 --> 03:59:36.078]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:59:36.078 --> 03:59:37.019]  I physically will.
[03:59:37.019 --> 03:59:47.152]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWarshore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:59:47.152 --> 03:59:49.755]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
