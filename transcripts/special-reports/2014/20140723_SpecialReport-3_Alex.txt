[00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:23.803]  There may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States.
[00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:29.145]  In our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man.
[00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:42.280]  If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.344]  Reassuring words, but completely fabricated.
[00:00:45.925 --> 00:01:11.794]  Because if and when Obama or the next puppet declares the suspension of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, they will hastily invoke Executive Order 11921, which provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency will assume control over the mechanisms of production and distribution.
[00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:12.275]  I'm good.
[00:01:19.142 --> 00:01:24.083]  As you can see behind me, there's a brown RV and it actually says FEMA written on the side of it.
[00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:29.724]  And as CNN reported, this facility in particular can hold a thousand illegals and detention cells inside of it.
[00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:35.285]  And there's no doubt that other facilities such as this one can be built across the U.S.
[00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:40.986]  to hold American citizens during a government-declared emergency such as an economic collapse.
[00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:43.227]  It is 55,000 square feet.
[00:01:43.727 --> 00:01:48.328]  It is separated into four different pods and they're expected to hold up to a thousand kids.
[00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:54.793]  It's 72 hour increments at a time and release them by bus into different parts of the country.
[00:01:55.353 --> 00:01:57.054]  They have a health facility.
[00:01:57.355 --> 00:02:00.657]  They have a, like a DFAC, a dining facility.
[00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.099]  All this stuff is inside here right now.
[00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.361]  And behind me too, if you see, there's a brown bus.
[00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:07.683]  It is a giant FEMA bus.
[00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:15.169]  Here comes more and more politicians out of this brand new facility in McAllen, Texas, where they've been meeting.
[00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:20.470]  And coming up with ways to help the Obama administration import poverty into our country.
[00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:28.319]  Meanwhile, Readiness Exercise 1984, or Rex 84 as it's known, the brainchild of Lt.
[00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:28.679]  Col.
[00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:34.081]  Oliver North and the modus operandi of the Bush-Cheney administration, plays out.
[00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:42.703]  As the flow of more gang and cartel activities increase in the U.S., so does the possibility of our government seizing totalitarian control.
[00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:46.925]  The plan also authorizes the military to direct ordered movements.
[00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:48.326]  I was invited by a person
[00:03:15.942 --> 00:03:21.484]  to go to a Bilderberg meeting and I found it to be an interesting group of people.
[00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:25.306]  The slippery slope towards martial law gains traction.
[00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:43.293]  When Bilderberg attendee Governor Rick Perry speaks cordially with President Obama two days after receiving a letter from President Obama's handler Valerie Jarrett, the Rex 84 playbook thrives on the possibility of a well-orchestrated maneuver between state and federal entities.
[00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:46.215]  Whether both parties are aware or not.
[00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:16.000]  No doubt this show of force is in response to the severe backlash BCFS received after the alternative media broke the news about the proposed hotel purchase which the company now claims it is no longer pursuing.
[00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:24.963]  What do you mean?
[00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:31.287]  I googled that InfoWars website and I saw you already posted a blog on it.
[00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:33.268]  So I just, I'm tired of the media.
[00:04:33.288 --> 00:04:34.889]  I just don't want anything to do with it.
[00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:38.611]  So I'm going to go ahead and refuse your consent.
[00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:41.093]  You're canceling the reservation then?
[00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:41.593]  That is correct.
[00:04:42.130 --> 00:05:02.527]  The BCFS, which also manages the shelter housing 2,000 illegal immigrant youth on Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, began as an orphanage in 1944, but has since emerged as a global network for companies which work for various federal agencies such as FEMA in response to government-declared emergencies.
[00:05:03.248 --> 00:05:07.211]  Alright, right now we're on the edge of the Rio Bravo River, where we found a pair of shoes right up here.
[00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:14.217]  Now if you come over here and take a look down, the illegals swim across that side of the embankment and they come over here to this area and they use it as a way to climb up to freedom.
[00:05:31.994 --> 00:05:32.194]  to be
[00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:57.034]  All the way into the fields and onto a main highway where they possibly get picked up by someone over here and then they ship them off to different parts unknown in the country.
[00:05:57.214 --> 00:06:00.057]  Alright, I'm right here with Kit Daniels from Info Wars.
[00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:00.938]  He's one of our riders.
[00:06:01.218 --> 00:06:04.301]  Now tell me what it is that you've seen since we've been out here the past 24 hours.
[00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:08.064]  I've seen a lot of blankets, a lot of shoes, a lot of biohazardous material.
[00:06:08.424 --> 00:06:11.227]  This is a heavily crossed area for immigrants.
[00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:13.999]  Now, do you think this is one of the main spots, though?
[00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.600]  Like you said, you saw a blanket over there.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.103]  They're more than likely smuggling things across over here and probably getting picked up by someone, don't you think?
[00:06:20.303 --> 00:06:20.743]  Absolutely.
[00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:23.686]  We've seen so many vehicles, like SUVs, driving out of this area.
[00:06:23.726 --> 00:06:36.395]  It's obvious that there's coyotes running through here and picking people up and trafficking them further into the United States if they don't even surrender to the Border Patrol, in which even if they do surrender to the Border Patrol, they're just going to get three hots and a cot.
[00:06:36.815 --> 00:06:38.877]  I'm Joe Biggs with Kick Daniels, signing off.
[00:06:39.437 --> 00:06:44.997]  For InfoWars.com at the edge of the last bit of America still standing.
[00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:57.008]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:02.392]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[00:07:02.452 --> 00:07:07.496]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[00:07:09.217 --> 00:07:13.781]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:15.562]  There's only 500 of each.
[00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:19.945]  We're talking about Made in America belt buckles in nickel brass.
[00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:22.007]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[00:07:22.247 --> 00:07:22.727]  This is
[00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:43.883]  I don't know.
