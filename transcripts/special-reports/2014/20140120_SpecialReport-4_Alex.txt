[00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:05.726]  The recent decision to decriminalize marijuana in Colorado has got the DEA worried.
[00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:13.090]  Going down the path to legalization in this country is reckless and irresponsible.
[00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:14.767]  It scares us.
[00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:19.850]  But it seems what's really scaring the Drug Enforcement Agency is the potential loss of blood money.
[00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:33.278]  Just one day prior to the Senate hearing this week, court documents revealed the DEA was smuggling billions of dollars in drugs with Mexico's notorious Sinaloa drug cartel in exchange for information on rival cartels.
[00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:39.342]  This is just another strike against the DEA that's causing the general public to question the drug trade's real source.
[00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:47.986]  Attorney General Eric Holder refused to prosecute HSBC last year when the bank was caught laundering billions in drug money for Mexican cartels.
[00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:57.090]  If you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.
[00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.173]  And I think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large.
[00:01:03.493 --> 00:01:14.256]  And in 2011, banking giant Wachovia received no criminal charges after they were found to have laundered more than $378 billion in drug money for the Sinaloa cartel as well.
[00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:27.740]  But incredibly, as cartel money laundering banks are protected by the federal government, the DEA has threatened those same banks with legal action if they store cash for small-time legal marijuana businesses in Washington and Colorado.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:36.403]  As InfoWars has said for years, the DEA at the highest level is nothing more than a smuggling and protection agency for cartels that work with major banks.
[00:01:36.703 --> 00:01:41.305]  Unfortunately, the federal government's relationship with dangerous cartels goes much further.
[00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:48.187]  High-ranking Sinaloa member Jesus Zambada Niebla recently admitted that the cartel had received weapons from the U.S.
[00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:51.268]  government for years under Operation Fast and Furious.
[00:01:51.488 --> 00:01:56.230]  While the Obama administration claims the operation was just to track guns into Mexico,
[00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.351]  The Ebola revealed the weapons were to be used for war with rival cartels.
[00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:07.754]  Ironically, Wednesday's Senate hearing was focused primarily on drug cultivation in Afghanistan, where the arrival of U.S.
[00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:12.035]  troops in 2001 has led to record-level opium production.
[00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:17.717]  The New York Times revealed one of Afghanistan's biggest drug kingpins was on the CIA payroll.
[00:02:18.177 --> 00:02:24.740]  The Taliban finances much of its operations by selling opium, which is grown from poppies which are right now being harvested.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.642]  So here's the question, why are American troops now helping Afghan farmers grow that opium?
[00:02:31.043 --> 00:02:35.564]  Back to this decision to legalize marijuana for recreational use at the state level.
[00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:37.285]  This is a bad experiment.
[00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.366]  It's a bad, bad experiment.
[00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:43.588]  And it's going to cost the United States in terms of social costs.
