[00:00:01.643 --> 00:00:02.684]  You know it's Cinco de Mayo.
[00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:03.944]  I know it's Cinco de Mayo.
[00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:05.846]  Alright, so what does Cinco de Mayo mean to you?
[00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:07.267]  It's a made-up holiday.
[00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:09.348]  So do you guys know what Cinco de Mayo is all about?
[00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:10.789]  No, I don't.
[00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:12.590]  I know it's not a real Mexican holiday.
[00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:15.718]  Um, is it Mexican independence?
[00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:20.020]  What it signifies is Mexico's win over French forces back in the 1800s.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.681]  Okay, so it's nothing to do with Easter.
[00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:23.342]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:26.523]  But as a Brit, I like to hear about French getting beaten.
[00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:28.684]  I'm noticing your American flag t-shirt.
[00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:38.269]  Because, you know, in the state of California they had a situation around the city of San Francisco where people were kicked out of school because they wore an American flag t-shirt on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:39.029]  Really?
[00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.790]  I had no idea.
[00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.070]  That's very interesting.
[00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.491]  It's really sad, too.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.720]  Why is it sad?
[00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:45.762]  Well, I mean, we're in America.
[00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:52.946]  I mean, even though it's a Mexican, you know, celebration or whatever, Independence Day, like, we're still American, you know?
[00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:55.948]  I think you should be able to wear whatever kind of t-shirt you want.
[00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:58.230]  Yeah, that's freedom of expression, freedom of speech.
[00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.273]  You should be able to express yourself and wear what you want without purposely offending people.
[00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:04.814]  Let's talk about vaccines briefly.
[00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:09.857]  There's a big drug that's being pushed on females, especially in Mexico, and that's Gardasil.
[00:01:09.917 --> 00:01:11.678]  It guards against, supposedly, against
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.540]  HBV.
[00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.683]  They're trying to give it to a lot of the schoolgirls around age 9 or 10.
[00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:18.725]  And there have been some health effects associated with Gardasil.
[00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.627]  I don't know if you guys keep up on the controversy.
[00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:25.150]  They got mad at Katie Couric as she talked about some of the adverse effects from Gardasil.
[00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.871]  Have you taken it?
[00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:26.251]  No.
[00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:28.169]  I don't know.
[00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.190]  I really haven't heard anything about that.
[00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.533]  I don't take that vaccine, obviously, because I don't know about it.
[00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:41.338]  I actually took that vaccine when I was younger, but I don't really know any of the controversial issues on it.
[00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.259]  Cinco de Mayo.
[00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:54.548]  It commemorates Mexico's victory over French forces, but with Mexican school children being targeted by harmful pharmaceuticals such as Gardasil, and children here in the States being taught not to respect other people's cultures, there are still more victories to be won.
[00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.651]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:01.354]  And one final question since you're over there on the other side of the pond.
[00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:02.535]  What do you think about Pierce Morgan?
[00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:05.958]  He's a bit of a twat.
[00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:07.599]  And I'm quite glad he got sacked.
[00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:21.679]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.980]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.741]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant.
[00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:33.024]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:39.027]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:42.929]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.010]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.213]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:56.534]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:02:56.574 --> 00:02:57.635]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:06.746]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
