[00:00:08.587 --> 00:00:10.729]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:15.052]  Now, I read an interesting article just a few minutes ago by Variety.com.
[00:00:15.412 --> 00:00:25.139]  They are also a magazine, a very popular magazine out of Hollywood who do articles on upcoming films, reviews, things of that nature, acting gigs, stuff such as that.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:34.827]  Now, a group that they're calling the Sony Hackers, there's no names, no one knows who these people are for some reason, but the Sony Hackers have now threatened a 9-11 style attack
[00:00:35.507 --> 00:00:39.728]  Any movie theaters that show the upcoming movie, The Interview.
[00:00:40.148 --> 00:00:44.289]  The Interview is a movie with Seth Rogen and James Franco.
[00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:52.451]  Now, what they are, they are two reporters in America who end up getting a chance to go interview Kim Jong-un, the dictator of North Korea.
[00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:57.872]  And the CIA intercepts him and asks him to go over there and assassinate Kim Jong-un.
[00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:00.233]  This is the Secretary of Communication for North Korea.
[00:01:00.513 --> 00:01:04.374]  Our Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un is interested in doing an interview with Dave Skylark.
[00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:04.914]  Oh my God.
[00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.613]  We will meet 50 kilometers west of Dangdong, northeastern China.
[00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:14.097]  I will be traveling to Bongyang, North Korea, to interview President Kim Jong Un.
[00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.841]  Mr. Rappaport, I am Agent Lacey with Central Intelligence.
[00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:25.307]  You two are going to be in a room alone with Kim, and the CIA would love it if you could take him out.
[00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:27.068]  Hmm?
[00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:28.249]  Take him out.
[00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.250]  For coffee?
[00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.670]  Dinner?
[00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:30.551]  For kimchi?
[00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:32.573]  No, uh, take him out.
[00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:35.018]  You want us to kill the leader of North Korea?
[00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:35.338]  Yes.
[00:01:36.178 --> 00:01:38.078]  Now the Sony hackers have already made threats.
[00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:47.821]  They've already actually posted information about Sony Films, salary information of top executives, employee medical records, and social security numbers thus far.
[00:01:47.881 --> 00:02:01.365]  But now we are getting this new threat that anybody who is going to premiere the movie, show it, and people who are going to go see it, especially on Thursday, that is the release in New York City, that they are to experience 9-11 style attacks.
[00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:06.767]  Here's the warning, the newest warning right now from the Sony hackers.
[00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:13.270]  It says, we will clearly show it to you at the very time and place as the interview will be shown, including the premiere.
[00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.892]  How bitter fate those who seek fun and terror should be doomed to.
[00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:21.834]  Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.
[00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:23.375]  The world will be full of fear.
[00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:24.915]  Remember this 11th of September 2001.
[00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:30.098]  We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.
[00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:32.358]  If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.
[00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:37.299]  Whatever comes in the next coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.
[00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.480]  All the world will denounce the Sony.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.500]  More to come.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.502]  We've seen attacks in theaters before and then, you know, closely thereafter, they're trying to use that as a way to ban assault rifles and things of that nature.
[00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:59.584]  If this happens on a large scale at many different theaters across the nation, when this movie is released, this could be another tool to strip us of our liberties and our Second Amendment rights.
[00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:02.626]  So it makes me think this could be something on our side.
[00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:07.369]  Is our government actually making these threats on these theaters if they show these films?
[00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:14.814]  Or is this another way that Sony could use this as a tool to promote the film and make it seem ten times more interesting than what it is?
[00:03:15.214 --> 00:03:20.438]  Because we know the Seth Rogen, James Franco movies aren't really award-winning films.
[00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:21.999]  They're kind of funny comedies.
[00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:29.324]  But this definitely helps add to it and make people want to go, hmm, I think I might go see that movie now because it's really sparked a lot of controversy.
[00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:33.025]  Gentlemen, you are entering into the most dangerous country on earth.
[00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:34.565]  Please remember, Kim Jong-un is a master manipulator.
[00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:35.385]  I have a gift for you.
[00:03:59.232 --> 00:04:08.658]  Do we really think North Korea, even though they might have nuclear capabilities or they do have capabilities nuclear, do you think they really have the capabilities though to actually go in and hack all this stuff?
[00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:14.302]  And then if that be the case, is our government and or Sony Pictures not going to be able to find out who did this?
[00:04:14.783 --> 00:04:22.227]  Kim Jong-un's people believe anything he tells them, including that he can speak to dolphins or he doesn't urinate and defecate.
[00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.150]  But he does talk to dolphins.
[00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.894]  Now, tell us what you think will happen at the bottom of the comments here on the YouTube video.
