[00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:08.136]  We're in Ferguson, Missouri, in front of the Quick Trip.
[00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:11.478]  This is where everything started for us when we were back here in August.
[00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.700]  As you can see, the area is now blocked off.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.721]  They have the fencing up.
[00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.523]  When we were here earlier, you could get as close to actually walking inside the Quick Trip.
[00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.205]  We saw somebody do that, though we definitely do not recommend it.
[00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:26.968]  You can see many of the messages spray-painted on the Quick Trip grounds.
[00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:31.670]  Also, these signs here, what you're looking at here, these are the Ribbons of Hope.
[00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:33.792]  This is actually a note that somebody placed
[00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:38.253]  But if we continue to walk down, you'll see all the ribbons, this community art project.
[00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:45.416]  Some of these have names of people who are now deceased, possibly due to a situation with the police.
[00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:50.377]  Other ones have inspirational sayings, Bible verses, all types of things here.
[00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:56.139]  And it was here at this location as well, right over here.
[00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.520]  Maybe we should pan over here and show people.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.642]  This is where the flashbang grenades started after they told us to turn off our cameras.
[00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.293]  No, we were out here filming.
[00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:07.788]  This was just going back to August.
[00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:15.411]  This was probably about two hours after the police chief, I believe his name is Jackson, came on TV and he said, there is no curfew in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:26.375]  Then about two hours later, about six o'clock, when the sun was still shining high in the sky, MRAPs, 70 plus guys in heavy armor, guys aiming guns at people in the crowd, telling them to disperse and go home.
[00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:31.897]  But apparently that doesn't constitute a curfew here in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.119]  And right over here, giving you guys the full tour,
[00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.340]  It's myself, Josh Owens.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.941]  They fixed that sign, Joe Biggs, that oak mount.
[00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:42.503]  Last time we were here, that was torn to shreds.
[00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:43.643]  Had some bullet holes in it.
[00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.025]  It's also shot through with some rubber bullets as well.
[00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:51.928]  It was right over here by that sign where Josh, our cameraman, was tear gassed.
[00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:55.671]  Joe Biggs was shot with a rubber bullet right around here in this area.
[00:01:56.372 --> 00:01:57.613]  Then I took running down the street.
[00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:02.398]  We all kind of split up in our own separate ways and eventually got back together.
[00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:04.620]  So, you know, we hear that the St.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.924]  Louis County Police are going to be running the field operations, the ground operations here in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:10.405]  Should things turn ugly?
[00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:11.306]  And it's the St.
[00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:15.670]  Louis County Police that had a lot to do with the situation that happened that night.
[00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:26.339]  But we see Governor Nixon, he came out earlier, I guess last night to be more accurate, and he said that, well, he was asked the question by a journalist, you know, well, who's going to be in charge of the whole thing?
[00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:27.881]  Because I thought, you know, it's going to be the St.
[00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:30.503]  Louis County Police, but I guess there's somebody above that.
[00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:32.905]  He was asked by the journalist, you know, who's going to be running the whole shebang?
[00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.908]  And he said, oh, well, I hope we can all work together.
[00:02:36.528 --> 00:02:38.069]  So it brings a lot of questions to my mind.
[00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.270]  You know, who's actually going to be in charge of this operation?
[00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.132]  Of course, we see the National Guard being able to be mobilized at a moment's notice.
[00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:48.033]  Also, multiple sightings of DHS vehicles.
[00:02:48.073 --> 00:02:50.014]  Last night, we saw some government vehicles.
[00:02:50.034 --> 00:02:52.695]  They didn't say DHS on the side, but they did say U.S.
[00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:53.075]  government.
[00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:57.257]  So hopefully, things will stay peaceful as they are right now.
[00:02:57.557 --> 00:02:59.698]  You know, there's not a lot of people out in the streets.
[00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:00.999]  It's a very cold situation.
[00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:06.491]  And to me, if they're expecting violence as the governor is, as the St.
[00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:12.076]  Louis County Police and all these other groups are, my question is, why won't they release the verdict now when it's ice cold?
[00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:13.877]  It's about 17 degrees out here.
[00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:19.822]  You know, why won't you release it now when you have many people that would be scared off by this very cold weather?
[00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:21.143]  And let's talk a moment.
[00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:26.115]  About the actions, because everybody wants to talk about the violent protesters, and yes, there were more than a few.
[00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:32.217]  But there were also plenty of good, decent people who came out and did stuff like this, the peaceful protesters.
[00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:33.858]  And nobody wants to seem to talk about those people.
[00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:39.280]  They always want to show that guy in Quick Trip with his butt hanging out his jeans, you know, stealing a six-pack of beer or whatever he's doing.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.822]  But they don't want to talk about all the thousands of people that myself, Joe Biggs, Josh Owens, and the rest of our crew had a chance to meet while we were out here.
[00:03:47.588 --> 00:03:52.912]  And I'll take you to what's my favorite landmark of this situation out here.
[00:03:53.672 --> 00:03:54.653]  Here's this block right here.
[00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.874]  You guys may have saw that video.
[00:03:55.914 --> 00:03:58.496]  Thousands protest peacefully in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:06.621]  I was standing right here on this block, myself and Josh Owens, looking out into the crowd of thousands of people, probably 2,000, 3,000 people at that time.
[00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:09.223]  Many more thousand came later on that evening.
[00:04:10.103 --> 00:04:11.785]  So I want to tell you, everybody out here is a thug.
[00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:13.706]  Everybody's out here throwing Molotov cocktails.
[00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:21.618]  Yeah, there are thugs, there are volatile cocktail throwers, provocateurs, but you have many innocent, decent people who just want to find out what's going on in their community.
[00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:31.126]  It's my understanding that regardless of what happened with Mike Brown and Darren Wilson, you know, this community has been plagued by many questionable police actions over the past many years.
[00:04:31.486 --> 00:04:34.729]  So as we wait for this indictment to come, we'll be here to document the situation.
