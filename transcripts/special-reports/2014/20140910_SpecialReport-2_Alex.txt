[00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:21.132]  I want to take some time this evening to talk directly to the viewers out there about one of the most important health issues, not just here in the United States, but worldwide.
[00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:24.033]  And that is our water, H2O.
[00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:26.295]  What makes the blue planet blue?
[00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:49.871]  The social engineers have been manipulating and bombarding the water supply since the 1930s when the communists in Russia, on record, began putting hydrofluorosilic acid in their gulag work camps water supplies because their chemists had shown in rat studies that it made the population more servile, more docile.
[00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.827]  If you fast forward to the Nazis in World War II, they adopted it.
[00:00:55.307 --> 00:00:58.649]  That is on record and came out in the Nuremberg trials.
[00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.930]  But it's not just hydrofluorosilic acid that's added to the water.
[00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:13.594]  It is hundreds and hundreds of chemicals that are mixed in with the fluoride that itself is a toxic waste derivative from the fertilizer industries and also the aluminum smelting industry.
[00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:16.015]  So we literally pay
[00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:17.596]  We're good to go.
[00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:42.610]  That's why it's essential to filter your water.
[00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:52.200]  There are hundreds of different pathogens, industrial chemicals, but also natural toxins that are getting into the water supply.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.265]  And it is essential to filter your water, not just with a regular store-bought filter,
[00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:07.829]  That doesn't even cut anything out, just makes the water taste okay, but with scientific gravity-fed filters like the ProPure G2 systems.
[00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.531]  That's why we sell it, it's why we promote it, because for myself and my family, I wanted the very best.
[00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:21.354]  Now recently we have seen two different events in West Virginia and Ohio.
[00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:33.719]  In Toledo and in Charleston and other areas where we had the deadly chemical MCHM in the water supply that can kill you so they said don't drink it.
[00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:38.521]  And then we also had a deadly naturally occurring algae
[00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:41.350]  That got into the water supply.
[00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.295]  To another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:50.778]  So here's the takeaway from what I'm saying tonight.
[00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:58.964]  Most people now know that fluoride and its derivatives are deadly and are being added to the water supply as social engineering and social control.
[00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:14.032]  But what people don't know is that a lot of these overtaxed public water systems, but also well systems as well, have been contaminated by things like microcystin, that is a toxin released by a commonly occurring algae.
[00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:18.834]  And if you drank this stuff that was in the Toledo water supply, it would kill you.
[00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:23.037]  And so for a week, people couldn't drink out of the water.
[00:03:23.477 --> 00:03:25.099]  And boiling it doesn't do anything.
[00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.641]  It's a toxin released by the fungus.
[00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.343]  This fungus is already in most water supplies.
[00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:33.946]  And so what you want to do is reduce or remove it.
[00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:39.110]  Most water filters that are out there, you buy at the store, you can go research them.
[00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.872]  They just reduce any bad flavor.
[00:03:42.614 --> 00:04:00.057]  And obviously it's better than nothing, but something like a ProPure G2 system is simply the best for the price, because it reduces the non-detectable levels or completely removes or massively cuts back on not just this toxin, but literally hundreds of others.
[00:04:00.097 --> 00:04:02.038]  And we've got the test here to show you.
[00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:07.939]  Here is an EnviroTech Laboratories in New Jersey, one of the most respected in the country.
[00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.899]  This is a recent test.
[00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.460]  Uh, that just came out, uh, in August of this month.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.541]  So just a few, few weeks ago.
[00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:22.204]  And you notice here that it reduced it by 99% reduced that toxin.
[00:04:22.584 --> 00:04:25.065]  Most filters don't even take half of it out.
[00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:30.567]  If you look at the side-by-side comparisons at fullwarestore.com, that's just one toxin.
[00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:32.628]  Let's look at another one that's very deadly.
[00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:35.149]  MCHM, it removed 99.89%
[00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:40.353]  All right.
[00:05:00.982 --> 00:05:04.104]  In very dangerous levels, MCHM.
[00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:07.726]  So there are two different EnviroTech laboratory documents.
[00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:18.552]  We'll post this video again up at InfoWarsTore.com in the ProPure G2 filter area so people can see the documentation for themselves.
[00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:25.397]  And this only happens, you only see these big freakouts when there's really high levels of it and it would kill people outright.
[00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:26.837]  That's when they freak out.
[00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:28.999]  Usually when it's just low level,
[00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:32.361]  They don't tell people and they just pass it on down to the public.
[00:05:32.622 --> 00:05:39.568]  This is one of the things taxing our livers, taxing our blood supply, taxing our endocrine glands.
[00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:48.215]  According to the doctors I've talked to, that's one reason people are so sick with so many allergies is our bodies are just overwhelmed by all of these different toxins.
[00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:52.879]  That's why it's not even debatable on whether or not you should be
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.400]  We're good to go.
[00:06:16.678 --> 00:06:17.679]  God knows what's in there.
[00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:18.959]  I can, like, taste dirt in it.
[00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.942]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, and glyphosate.
[00:06:24.062 --> 00:06:31.866]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:33.207]  This is very tasty.
[00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:33.647]  It's good!
[00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:36.209]  Go to infowarsstore.com today.
[00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:40.451]  Use promo code WATER and save 10% off your ProPure® purchase.
[00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:41.412]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.799]  Now let's look at a report that ProPure commissioned by EnviroTech Laboratories, again one of the most respected in the country.
[00:06:53.956 --> 00:07:11.380]  Just recently, so folks can see, the literally hundreds of toxic and deadly chemicals that are in the water supply, both man-made and natural, that they were able to basically reduce down to non-detectable levels or to completely clean it out or cut it down by 99.5%, 99.4%, 97.0%, 99.4%.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.101]  You can see all these different numbers, all these different chemicals,
[00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.364]  This is simply amazing.
[00:07:24.664 --> 00:07:35.169]  When you stack this up against many of the leading competitors, a lot of the filters out there won't even reduce any of this stuff because they're not designed to do it.
[00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:41.771]  That's why the choice for my family is Pro-Pure Family and their G2 systems.
[00:07:42.072 --> 00:07:47.074]  We also carry some other more affordable water filtration systems that are excellent as well.
[00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:49.995]  All available at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:51.516]  And this is a win-win.
[00:07:52.156 --> 00:08:07.931]  Because when you buy high-quality, discounted, gravity-fed water filtration systems from InfoWarsStore.com, you're helping your own health, you're helping purify your water, you're helping your family, and you're helping fund the very tip of the spear
[00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:08.631]  Thank you.
[00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:38.281]  We're the biggest distributor of ProPure, a big American company in the world, because we obviously have a giant audience of great patriots, but also because we sell it at the very lowest price.
[00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:44.083]  We already have the lowest price we can have at InfowarsStore.com, and with promo code WATER,
[00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:46.344]  It brings it down an additional 10%.
[00:08:47.764 --> 00:09:06.130]  And for a limited time, while these suckers are in stock, we are going to offer, with every ProPure product, whether it be a stainless steel stem, or whether it be the whole system, or just the filters, 10 free 2 plus 2 equals 4 Infowars.com bumper stickers.
[00:09:07.233 --> 00:09:14.680]  And when people at your business or on your car or wherever or on your notebooks at college or high school ask you, what does this mean?
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.663]  Well, Common Core says 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:09:18.984 --> 00:09:22.688]  Our government says that Obamacare doesn't have death panels even though it does.
[00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.898]  Obama says we didn't build our businesses.
[00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:29.920]  You counter it with, no, 2 plus 2 does equal 4.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.122]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid or fluoride does reduce IQs in children by upwards of 10 points.
[00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:41.184]  It does give a 7-fold increase in bone cancer and hundreds of other horrible things.
[00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:42.765]  So please believe us.
[00:09:42.805 --> 00:09:44.146]  We are conspiracy theorists.
[00:09:44.466 --> 00:09:45.206]  We are kooks.
[00:09:45.266 --> 00:09:45.947]  We are nuts.
[00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:47.207]  We do the research.
[00:09:47.647 --> 00:09:49.328]  We immerse ourselves in reality.
[00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:51.109]  We believe 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:09:51.889 --> 00:10:03.118]  You may disagree with us, but regardless, you'll get high-quality, stainless steel, gravity-fed, best filters out there from the research we've done, at the lowest price, and 10 free stickers.
[00:10:03.878 --> 00:10:08.662]  So even if you're an establishment person, you can laugh with your friends and say, look at that crazy Alex Jones.
[00:10:09.022 --> 00:10:10.744]  He says 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:10:11.925 --> 00:10:16.048]  And maybe you can give the water filters to your kook neighbor that doesn't trust the government.
[00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:18.927]  All right, that's enough satire here this evening.
[00:10:19.528 --> 00:10:25.213]  Until tomorrow, I'm Alex Jones signing off for this edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:10:25.753 --> 00:10:28.055]  Don't filter your water at your own peril.
[00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:34.541]  The best water filtration systems at the best price are available InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:39.766]  Until then, I'll see you tomorrow right here with InfoWars Nightly News.
