[00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:09.704]  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has released a report detailing the abuses by the Obama administration.
[00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:18.331]  The list is well compiled and includes things like misguiding the press on Benghazi, as well as ordering Boeing to fire 1,000 employees in South Carolina.
[00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:22.554]  As good as the report is, here are 10 items that it doesn't include.
[00:00:22.954 --> 00:00:23.475]  Number 10.
[00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:27.078]  The White House ignoring petitions they encourage citizens to file.
[00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:30.721]  Now there are petitions that request the building of a functioning Death Star,
[00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:32.182]  I have another one in my pocket too.
[00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.260]  I have about, like, six in my purse now.
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.021]  And a few more at home.
[00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:51.763]  Each and every one of these phones work.
[00:00:52.063 --> 00:00:55.065]  At home, I know I have about 30, and all of them are on.
[00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:58.448]  But how did she manage to amass such a cellular jackpot?
[00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:00.309]  How long did it take you to get all these phones?
[00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.491]  Five, ten minutes to get this one, just now.
[00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:04.553]  And I walked out with this one, just now.
[00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:06.274]  Well, partly thanks to you.
[00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:12.439]  That's because anyone who pays a cell phone bill also subsidizes the phones filling up Monique's purse.
[00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:18.124]  Courtesy of a charge buried in your monthly bill called a universal access fee.
[00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:27.894]  Number 8 Denying a Christian family's request for asylum while granting driver's licenses to undocumented California workers who can sneak past border patrol.
[00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:29.195]  Number 7.
[00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:34.119]  Refusing to debate climate change while intentionally bankrupting the coal industry.
[00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.181]  So, if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:45.687]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:46.607]  Number 6.
[00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:51.310]  The half-baked so-called investigation into the murder of Seal Team 6.
[00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.173]  If you almost killed Mr. Jones and they gave you a book with no ink,
[00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.850]  I was with my mom yesterday.
[00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.651]  She said, you're lucky.
[00:01:58.691 --> 00:01:59.131]  They're lucky.
[00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:00.031]  Grandpop ain't alive.
[00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:03.813]  He'd be going right through the frontiers of that White House, Santa Obama.
[00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:05.273]  You know?
[00:02:05.773 --> 00:02:06.874]  We need some answers here.
[00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:08.214]  Somebody has to be held accountable.
[00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.415]  I just don't want to hear it was a bad plan, lucky shot, all that bull.
[00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:14.116]  I need somebody to go to jail.
[00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:14.976]  This is murder.
[00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:16.957]  This is murder, Mr. Jones.
[00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:19.378]  My son knew in June somebody was setting him up.
[00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.859]  But he didn't think somebody on his own side.
[00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:38.825]  Yesterday, the United States presented a powerful case that the Syrian government was responsible for this attack on its own people.
[00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:51.451]  Our intelligence shows the Assad regime and its forces preparing to use chemical weapons, launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of Damascus,
[00:02:52.358 --> 00:02:55.030]  And acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place.
[00:02:59.303 --> 00:03:06.928]  I've said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that.
[00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.332]  I've said repeatedly that America doesn't torture, and I'm going to make sure that we don't torture.
[00:03:13.013 --> 00:03:22.860]  Those are part and parcel of an effort to regain America's moral stature in the world.
[00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:24.047]  Number 3.
[00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:28.891]  Telling his former press secretary to act as if the drone program never existed.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.002]  What I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.
[00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:10.166]  Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced, but part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.
[00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:16.269]  Because frankly, in my hometown of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence, and they're not using AK-47s, they're using cheap handguns.
[00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.490]  And number one, lying to America's face.
[00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:24.980]  If you've got health care already, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.961]  If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.
[00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:28.741]  I intend to keep this promise.
[00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:32.443]  If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:35.285]  If you like your plan and your doctor, you can keep them.
[00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:37.046]  You'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[00:04:37.306 --> 00:04:39.887]  If you like your plan, you keep your plan.
[00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:44.089]  If you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
[00:04:44.109 --> 00:04:47.191]  If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance.
[00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:54.564]  Much like Senator Cruz, we can't include all the abuses because we simply don't have enough time to go through them all.
[00:04:54.884 --> 00:04:58.125]  But you can find all these and much more on InfoWars.com.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.202]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:14.564]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:16.284]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:05:16.304 --> 00:05:22.547]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:28.569]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:32.470]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.571]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:43.734]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:46.055]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:47.155]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:56.282]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
