[00:00:04.028 --> 00:00:06.089]  Alright last Thursday I spoke to Stu Harris.
[00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:12.113]  He is the Vice President of the Border Patrol Union in the Rio Grande Valley area of El Paso.
[00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:15.175]  And he told me that he tried to contact the CDC.
[00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.016]  They said it's something that they're not really willing to look into.
[00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:23.920]  So right now we're going to call up the CDC and ask them some very important questions about the outbreaks going on.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.806]  At Lackland Air Force Base with the swine flu from McAllen, Texas all the way to El Paso with scabies, MRSA, tuberculosis.
[00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:37.410]  Let's see what they have to say and let's find out when the CDC actually does step in to take care of something like this.
[00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:45.857]  Thanks for calling CDC.
[00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:46.658]  How may I help you?
[00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:49.139]  Yes, my name is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.463]  Who can I speak with to report a disease that's come across the border?
[00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.231]  All right, let me transfer you.
[00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:56.112]  Okay, thank you.
[00:00:56.873 --> 00:01:01.136]  T-Info, a service of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:06.561]  If you would like to continue in English, press 1.
[00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:10.365]  Over 1 million people in the U.S.
[00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:13.908]  have HIV, but almost 1 in 6 doesn't know it.
[00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:17.111]  Early diagnosis and treatment save lives.
[00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:20.494]  We're not going to know about the ones coming across the border if you won't go do your job.
[00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:27.557]  Good afternoon.
[00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:28.618]  Thank you for calling CDC.
[00:01:28.658 --> 00:01:29.278]  How can I help you?
[00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.121]  Yes, I'd like to speak to somebody about a disease that's come across our border.
[00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:34.522]  Who can I report that to?
[00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:37.704]  Okay, come across the border?
[00:01:38.284 --> 00:01:39.465]  I mean, in what way?
[00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:41.506]  What disease are you referring to?
[00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:42.807]  Oh, well, I have quite a few.
[00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:45.828]  I just need to be able to report it to somebody who takes those reports.
[00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:47.630]  One moment, please.
[00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.051]  Thank you for calling CDC Info.
[00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.092]  My name is Ashley.
[00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:52.072]  How may I help you today?
[00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.053]  Hey, how are you doing?
[00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:55.014]  Good, and yourself?
[00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:55.645]  Good.
[00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:56.606]  My name is Joe Biggs.
[00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:57.906]  I'm with InfoWars.
[00:01:58.607 --> 00:02:00.968]  Last Thursday I spoke to Stuart Harris.
[00:02:01.028 --> 00:02:07.651]  He is the Vice President of the Border Patrol Union in the Rio Grande Valley area of El Paso.
[00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:16.154]  And he said he tried to contact you and let you know about tuberculosis, scabies, chicken pox, things like that coming across our borders.
[00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.342]  At what point does the CDC intervene and step in and do something about this?
[00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:33.287]  Because the CDC told him that it wasn't their job or, you know, nothing for them to worry about to go down there and check it out.
[00:02:33.307 --> 00:02:39.410]  Okay, so you're calling in regards to the unaccompanied persons that are coming into the United States, is that correct?
[00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.232]  Yes, about the 96,000 that have come in the past month, yes.
[00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:49.969]  And you want to know what the CDC is doing in regards to this information, is that correct?
[00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:50.749]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.170]  Okay, sir.
[00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.210]  Well, I'm glad to answer this question for you.
[00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.131]  Have you been to our CDC.gov website in regards to this information?
[00:02:59.151 --> 00:03:00.552]  I'm just calling you.
[00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:02.552]  Okay, sir.
[00:03:02.992 --> 00:03:06.873]  Well, what I'd like to do is go ahead and find information on the CDC website.
[00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:08.713]  Do you mind holding for one or two minutes, please?
[00:03:09.013 --> 00:03:09.274]  Sure.
[00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:11.154]  Thanks for holding.
[00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:21.246]  Right now, a potential virus outbreak is imminent and we're on hold.
[00:03:21.407 --> 00:03:22.748]  Thank you, CDC.
[00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:24.409]  Thank you for holding, sir.
[00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:25.830]  I greatly appreciate your patience.
[00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:27.472]  Okay, thank you.
[00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:41.103]  Alright, so in regards to questions about the unaccompanied alien children, the Department of Homeland Security declared a crisis in South Texas because so many children without parents or guardians are crossing the border.
[00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:48.517]  The HHS estimates that 30,000 unaccompanied children will arrive in the Rio Grande Valley in 2014.
[00:03:49.198 --> 00:03:55.940]  In response to this influx of unaccompanied alien children, CDC's Emergency Operations Center has been activated.
[00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.698]  After this activation, the EOC will work closely with the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.
[00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:14.914]  CDC staff will consult on health issues and the UAC's countries of origin, consult on shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene, and provide staff for public health support.
[00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.859]  Well, I went down to Brownsville, Texas and listened to Nancy Pelosi talk, and she said most of this is all being ran out of El Paso.
[00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:36.011]  So then that takes me back to what I said previously, as the Vice President of the Border Patrol Union, who is over these guys, said he has just contacted you guys, and you said it is not an issue for you to worry about.
[00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.734]  So they might be on call, but they're not going down there and taking care of the issues.
[00:04:40.774 --> 00:04:47.078]  Right now, Border Patrol agents are testing positive for tuberculosis, scabies, and pox.
[00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:52.158]  Okay, sir.
[00:04:52.178 --> 00:04:55.461]  Well, I definitely understand your concerns at this time.
[00:04:55.521 --> 00:05:09.011]  If you have additional questions in regards to this topic, I would have to escalate this information or you can go on to the CDC.gov website and ask your inquiry on the website and they will respond by email.
[00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:14.255]  But this topic is out of scope for myself and the CDC info.
[00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:17.758]  They do not provide any additional information other than that.
[00:05:19.258 --> 00:05:20.759]  Well, who's going to go down to the border?
[00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.240]  When is this going to happen?
[00:05:26.422 --> 00:05:38.227]  Right now, basic EMTs are supposedly screening these kids, which means they're getting past our borders and they've made it to Lackland Air Force Base, which is in San Antonio, and there's a swine flu outbreak.
[00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:49.166]  Okay sir, so would you like to go ahead and go on to the cdc.gov website and submit your inquiry or would you like me to do it?
[00:05:49.847 --> 00:05:51.428]  I would like to talk to somebody about it, yes.
[00:05:53.409 --> 00:06:00.234]  Alright sir, so we're able to submit an inquiry where they'll respond by email but there's no one here that could speak to you about this information.
[00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:01.315]  Why not?
[00:06:01.335 --> 00:06:02.136]  That's your job.
[00:06:02.156 --> 00:06:04.417]  It's not a job, sir.
[00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:05.198]  It's not a what?
[00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:08.981]  Say it again?
[00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:13.697]  It is out of scope for the CDC info.
[00:06:13.757 --> 00:06:16.378]  You are speaking to CDC info, not CDC.
[00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.660]  Okay, well, can you transfer us?
[00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.281]  I cannot transfer you.
[00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:25.804]  I can submit an escalation, if you like, or you can go on the website yourself.
[00:06:26.424 --> 00:06:28.125]  Is there a number I can call to talk to somebody?
[00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:30.447]  No, sir.
[00:06:30.487 --> 00:06:32.388]  We do not have information in regards to that.
[00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:36.616]  So there's no way that I can report an outbreak.
[00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:40.480]  I have to go to a website and hope that someone gets to it in time.
[00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:45.586]  If you'd like to report an outbreak, you can report that to the state or local health department.
[00:06:46.868 --> 00:06:48.369]  But it's not the CDC's problem?
[00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:52.474]  It's not something that the CDC regulates.
[00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.380]  So what is it that you guys do then?
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:10.249]  Since you don't go down to border situations where there's a crisis, where kids are coming over and bringing these viruses like MRSA and things like that into our country, since that's not an issue that you guys take care of, what is it that CDC actually does then?
[00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:19.115]  Well, the role of CDC and FOA is to provide general health information in regards to health risks in the world.
[00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:23.378]  We provide reliable, consistent, science-based health information on behalf of the Centers
[00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:29.250]  Are you guys providing information to the Border Patrol then to help them?
[00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.771]  Okay, thank you.
[00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:37.582]  Yeah, I'll try.
[00:07:37.602 --> 00:07:38.623]  I'm starting to get a cough, though.
[00:07:38.763 --> 00:07:43.025]  CDC would like your feedback on your experience with CDC Info.
[00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:50.170]  Well, as you can see, the CDC doesn't really know what its job role is with this border situation whatsoever.
[00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.711]  So we're going to come up with a new name for the CDC.
[00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:56.333]  It's the Center of Disease, Confusion, and Disinformation.
[00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:58.194]  Make sure you tell your friends about that.
[00:07:58.935 --> 00:07:59.375]  Hopefully,
[00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:05.297]  I don't get this cough getting around too bad because I kind of feel a swine flu coming on because they can't do their job.
[00:08:05.557 --> 00:08:10.419]  They're too busy with the Obama administration inside working them like a puppet.
[00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:13.780]  So, once again, thank you for watching InfoWars.
