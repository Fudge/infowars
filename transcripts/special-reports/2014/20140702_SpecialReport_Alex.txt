[00:00:06.328 --> 00:00:11.492]  These cities just above the US-Mexico border don't receive any federal funding.
[00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:24.942]  The law-abiding, land-owning residents of towns such as Falfurrias, Texas are overrun by a tsunami of illegals as a result of what's called the funnel effect.
[00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:34.629]  The militarization of the border, which includes checkpoints, barriers, and security technology, diverts the human smuggling operations into treacherous, searing,
[00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:38.831]  Can you speak about your organization and explain where some of your volunteers come from and who they are?
[00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:05.080]  Actually, we even have a lot of out-of-staters.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.167]  Nebraska, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, many from Florida.
[00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:18.716]  Part of our mission is to enforce, or help, assist Border Patrol and other law enforcement entities
[00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:35.974]  We will post out on these heavily trafficked areas and report specific numbers to Border Patrol, specific locations, and they have learned that we're a big help.
[00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:37.956]  We're like extra eyes and ears out here.
[00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:50.527]  We also, a big part of our mission is awareness and we do many speaking engagements to let people know exactly what's going on out here and what we're seeing.
[00:01:51.327 --> 00:02:00.194]  Despite what others say in high political offices that the border is safe, these border towns are safe, it is not.
[00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:07.981]  Our ranch gate is 69 miles north of the bridge in Hidalgo that goes into Rionosa, Mexico.
[00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.422]  A little over a day's walk.
[00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:13.376]  Well, actually, most of these people don't walk 69 miles.
[00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:25.560]  They all pay a criminal organization, mainly the cartels, big money to be brought up here and let out south of this Border Patrol checkpoint, four and a half miles south of our ranch on U.S.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.961]  Highway 281.
[00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:31.923]  So they're all contributing to organized crime by paying large sums of money to be brought in here.
[00:02:31.963 --> 00:02:35.004]  And to give you an example, the Chinese are paying $50,000.
[00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.204]  The Indians are paying $10,000 to $20,000.
[00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:40.883]  All the Central Americans, the average is about 7,000.
[00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:46.325]  So, and the Mexicans, especially Southern Mexico, are paying 3,000.
[00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:55.566]  So, it's a huge, huge money event for the cartels, probably even more lucrative than the drug business.
[00:02:55.846 --> 00:03:01.388]  What percentage are you seeing from places other than South and Central America?
[00:03:01.468 --> 00:03:08.209]  The Border Patrol and Homeland Security categorize the people that are not from Mexico as other than Mexicans.
[00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:20.346]  Uh, prior to last night, uh, they were, it was running about 73% of the people apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley or OTMs other than Mexican.
[00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:25.509]  A lot of Central Americans, but really from all over the world.
[00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.692]  And, uh, we were informed last night that that number has escalated to 80%.
[00:03:32.132 --> 00:03:35.714]  So, uh, and this is, this is a fact.
[00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:37.735]  So most of the people that we encounter here.
[00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.352]  A larger percentage of them are people from other countries other than Mexico.
[00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:45.433]  And we're not told about the special interest aliens.
[00:03:46.054 --> 00:03:48.435]  We have had Somalians here.
[00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:55.398]  Once they got on that special alien list, they won't tell us that anymore.
[00:03:55.478 --> 00:04:03.902]  But there have been Somalians, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chinese, you name it, we've had it here.
[00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:05.043]  We've also
[00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:19.619]  Found evidence that people from these special interest countries in particular Pakistan and Afghanistan Iran Are coming through our property During one of our Texas border volunteer operations last year.
[00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:30.725]  We had a group of ten We spotted we followed them informed the Border Patrol where they were going to come out on the highway Border Patrol were not able to respond fast enough.
[00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:32.346]  They got they climbed the fence and
[00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:37.832]  And loaded up and left and were not caught.
[00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:43.513]  But as one of them was climbing over the fence, he dropped a package.
[00:04:44.894 --> 00:04:48.014]  And that package was an Urdu dictionary.
[00:04:48.114 --> 00:04:52.455]  Urdu is a language spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[00:04:53.216 --> 00:04:53.696]  And in that
[00:04:56.098 --> 00:04:58.019]  Translation book or do in English.
[00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.399]  There were a lot of phrases circled and outlined.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.180]  Do you speak Spanish?
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.800]  Do you speak English?
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.901]  You must pay in dollars.
[00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:23.825]  So we know that special interest countries in particular countries like Pakistan or Afghanistan that are not particularly friendly with our country are slipping through here under the disguise of and under the all this other
[00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:34.217]  Activity that's going on where these families are given up and and the Border Patrol Resources are being compromised so it's it's easier for them to slip through this private property
[00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:36.156]  And that's just one example.
[00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:42.499]  And more recently, within the past two weeks, some Iranian money was found in a bailout vehicle.
[00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.140]  So, we know they're coming in here.
[00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:59.348]  Besides that Iranian money being found in a bailout vehicle up here, four Syrians, which is not, you know, public news yet, but four Syrians were apprehended on the Rio Grande River a couple days ago.
[00:05:59.588 --> 00:06:06.335]  We're never divulged the special interest aliens, but I think it's time America gets alarmed.
[00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:08.838]  They've already come through here.
[00:06:08.918 --> 00:06:13.102]  It's us as the humanitarian crisis, and it's an OTM crisis.
[00:06:13.983 --> 00:06:16.566]  Just take out the factor of the women and children.
[00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:19.009]  It's an other-than-Mexican crisis right now.
[00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.971]  We're being invaded.
[00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:28.958]  By third world country people and in those third world country people are the special interest aliens.
[00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:31.800]  And our borders are porous.
[00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:34.563]  They feel like they're wide open right now.
[00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:37.966]  And that's a dangerous scenario.
[00:06:38.286 --> 00:07:03.832]  But I did discover, and I think this is laid out very clearly in the blog, that among the human trafficking going on in Belize is a large number of Lebanese males coming into the country with passports from Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and are given brand new identities, brand new names, and using handlers, handled off ultimately into America with a very dangerous package.
[00:07:04.112 --> 00:07:05.772]  Now that surprised me, that shocked me.
