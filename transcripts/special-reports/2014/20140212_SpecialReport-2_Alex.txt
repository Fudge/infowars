[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:00.430]  Woof!
[00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:00.710]  Woof!
[00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.151]  Woof!
[00:00:01.612 --> 00:00:02.934]  Woof!
[00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:22.524]  At some point, we've all been annoyed by a barking dog or a dog on the loose, and sometimes police are called in to handle these situations.
[00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:27.425]  But is this the type of police response that you would want to happen in your own front yard?
[00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:39.470]  And yes, once again, those dogs should have been under the direct supervision and control of their owner, but with a modern officer carrying things such as pepper spray, was lethal force really necessary?
[00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.711]  Let's stay on this topic of lethal force.
[00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:46.035]  What if the gun was turned the other way and the officer was in the crosshairs?
[00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:49.217]  That's exactly what happened right here in the state of Texas.
[00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:57.243]  Sheriffs looking for marijuana burst into a man's home and ran straight into gunfire by a startled resident killing an officer.
[00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:04.989]  The resident was able to avoid a murder charge, but it goes to show that over-aggressive police tactics can backfire on officers.
[00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.193]  Over-aggressive tactics such as kicking a woman out of her own home.
[00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:16.719]  A woman was displaced from her home so a SWAT team could perform reconnaissance, much like we saw during the Boston bombing.
[00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:27.968]  But to give credit where it's due, not all officers are out in the streets behaving badly, such as in New York where they just busted up a New York crime syndicate with joint agency cooperation.
[00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:33.273]  So if we have more stories like this, police going after real crimes and going after the real perpetrators,
[00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:37.836]  And not harassing the general populace, we can break free of this current police state.
[00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:41.718]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:56.210]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.793]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:08.785]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:17.331]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% Made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:20.073]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
