[00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:15.186]  I'm an avid supporter of the Second Amendment as well as self-defense rights.
[00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.589]  Somebody comes at you, you have to defend yourself.
[00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:18.810]  I understand that, of course.
[00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.074]  So a guy comes into your home, he comes into your business, he threatens your family, he threatens you personally.
[00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:25.916]  What are you going to do in that situation?
[00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.758]  Well, you may show mercy to the person.
[00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:29.279]  You may fire a warning shot.
[00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.304]  But just because you show mercy to the attacker, don't expect any mercy from the court system.
[00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:42.488]  Such is the case of a Florida father who is facing 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot against a man who is endangering his teenage daughter.
[00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.591]  The jury found the father guilty of child endangerment as well as other charges.
[00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:48.512]  No one was hurt by the round.
[00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:54.455]  Another Florida shooting that was overshadowed by the Trayvon Martin trial was that of Marissa Alexander.
[00:00:54.956 --> 00:01:00.479]  After being chased throughout her home by her abusive husband, Marissa fired a shot at her husband to scare him away.
[00:01:00.982 --> 00:01:03.965]  I believe when he threatened to kill me, that's what he was going to do.
[00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:06.867]  That's exactly what he intended to do.
[00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:12.493]  And had I not discharged my weapon at that point, I would not be here.
[00:01:12.953 --> 00:01:15.936]  But the right to self-defense doesn't extend to excessive force.
[00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:22.462]  Yes, you can defend yourself from somebody who's an immediate threat to you, but after that threat has passed, you can no longer assault that individual.
[00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:26.742]  Ursuline is accused of shooting and killing 16-year-old Antoine Parker.
[00:01:27.222 --> 00:01:32.987]  Surveillance video shows Parker and a friend trying to rob the Reliance Pharmacy in South Oklahoma City last May.
[00:01:33.568 --> 00:01:40.815]  It also shows Ursuline fighting back by shooting Parker once initially and then coming back and shooting Parker five more times.
[00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:46.698]  To bring you the broader spectrum of this clip, the pharmacist produces his own firearm and shoots back at the guys.
[00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:49.159]  He hits one of them in the face, knocking him to the ground.
[00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:49.880]  No issue there.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.743]  The pharmacist comes back into the pharmacy, he sees the guy laying on the ground, and then shoots him five additional times.
[00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:58.965]  Keeping in mind, this is a guy on the ground with a bullet in his face.
[00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:01.026]  You can't shoot somebody until they're dead.
[00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.048]  You can only shoot them until the point where they're no longer a threat.
[00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:08.150]  In closing, you do have a Second Amendment right, but be careful how you use it.
[00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:17.422]  Because whether it's shooting somebody until they're dead, or if you take the Joe Biden approach and issue a few warning shots, either one of these tactics could end up with you in a prison cell.

[00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:25.317]  If you want to protect yourself, get a double barrel shotgun.
[00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:32.321]  And I promise you, as I told my wife, we live in an area that's wooded and somewhat secluded.
[00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:43.386]  I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here, walk out, put that double barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.
[00:02:54.383 --> 00:03:00.186]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:10.352]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:03:10.672 --> 00:03:14.434]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:19.657]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:03:20.037 --> 00:03:26.260]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.861]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
