[00:00:24.796 --> 00:00:27.417]  Obviously, that was a dog wearing a costume.
[00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:30.339]  But there are real examples of genetic splicing.
[00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:37.202]  And while there may not be any actual spider dogs, at least none that I'm aware of, there are, in fact, spider goats.
[00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:44.166]  So these kids have the genes for a spider in them?
[00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:45.346]  Yes.
[00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.167]  It's insane!
[00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:50.100]  And where does the spider silk actually come from?
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.781]  Where do you get it?
[00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:53.843]  Well, it was designed so it comes in the milk.
[00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:59.908]  They look like such normal goats, but in fact they're totally unique and bizarre.
[00:00:59.948 --> 00:01:00.929]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.511]  I guess I would not say it's bizarre.
[00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:08.695]  The goats milk out a super strong silk that can be used for body armor as well as other things.
[00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:12.616]  And if that wasn't enough, how about a glow-in-the-dark pet?
[00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:18.498]  Jellyfish genes have been injected into cats and other animals to give them their distinctive look.
[00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:24.320]  And to round things out, trout have been genetically modified to have six-pack abs.
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.002]  Scientists achieved this by switching off a gene that normally stunts muscle growth.
[00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:37.670]  So whether it's a bodybuilder fish or some other type of scientific anomaly, I don't want anything that man's been playing God with to end up on my dinner plate.
