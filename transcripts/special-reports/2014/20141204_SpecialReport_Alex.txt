[00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:21.028]  The organized non-violent resistance is the most powerful weapon that oppressed people can use in breaking loose from the bondage of oppression.
[00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.631]  Now the other method that one might use is that of resignation or acquiescence.
[00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:37.416]  But I think that is just as bad as violence because non-cooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good.
[00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:57.263]  When I hear the young people around this table talk about their experiences, it violates my belief in what America can be.
[00:00:57.303 --> 00:01:06.251]  To hear young people feeling marginalized and distrustful, even after they've done everything right.
[00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:27.676]  I got a lot of heat from the, quote, black community last week for criticizing shooting at police and firefighters and shooting up their vehicles and shooting two cops and FBI agents got shot and all sorts of stuff happened.
[00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:29.816]  That makes protesting look bad.
[00:01:30.217 --> 00:01:37.618]  And Time Magazine came out and said, violent riots necessary, close quote.
[00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.790]  What, burning down your own neighborhood?
[00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:43.451]  So here's the big question.
[00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.572]  When is it right to have a violent revolution, and then who do you target?
[00:01:48.412 --> 00:02:09.297]  Now, everybody knows that the civil rights movement in the South professed nonviolence, that people were taught to cover their heads when the white mobs came to beat them up, and to just endure the spitting, the beating, and so forth.
[00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:20.459]  But violence, the violence of the white mob was being used strategically in those demonstrations.
[00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:28.682]  So, look, it's partly a problem on the strategy and propaganda.
[00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:31.866]  You know, it's a violent country.
[00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:34.148]  It's a violent government.
[00:02:34.748 --> 00:02:36.209]  It's killing people.
[00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.073]  And they're going to call us violent if we break a window.
[00:02:41.173 --> 00:02:42.494]  But they will do that.
[00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:48.059]  So probably, unless you have good reason for breaking the window, probably you shouldn't do that.
[00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:53.492]  Unless it's, you know, a big part of your strategy.
[00:02:54.192 --> 00:02:59.394]  Hello, I'm Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations.
[00:03:00.134 --> 00:03:02.094]  We must disarm to save lives.
[00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:10.177]  We must disarm so that we can redirect precious resources to health, education, and development.
[00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:15.903]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:21.829]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:26.494]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:33.441]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:41.742]  Nothing will move until everybody knows or has a family member who has been gunned down by a gun accident in this country.
[00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:43.923]  Is that when the attitude will change?
[00:03:44.543 --> 00:03:58.465]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:02.886]  One who believes in nonviolence must recognize
[00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:06.459]  The dimensions of evil within human nature.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.964]  And there is a danger that one can indulge in a sort of superficial optimism, thinking man is all good.
[00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:22.630]  Man does not only have the greater capacity for goodness, but there is also the potential for evil.
[00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:23.914]  Police in St.
[00:04:23.954 --> 00:04:30.977]  Louis say they've arrested two juveniles and are looking for two other suspects after a Bosnian man was beaten to death with hammers.
[00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:37.860]  Right after black people running up and down the street yelling, F the white people, kill the white people.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.961]  I'm already mad about you slant-eyed folks here anyway.
[00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:43.142]  People like you, that's what's wrong with you.
[00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:44.422]  That's what's wrong with the United States.
[00:04:44.442 --> 00:04:45.483]  People think that's like you.
[00:04:45.503 --> 00:04:47.123]  People like you is what's wrong with you.
[00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:56.042]  Andrew didn't want to show his face today because it looks worse than these pictures.
[00:04:56.463 --> 00:05:00.167]  He says the next thing he remembers is waking up in an ambulance.
[00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:04.453]  His girlfriend says the men attacked him and that they wouldn't stop.
[00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:07.798]  I was trying to pry them off before I knew it, he was on the floor.
[00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:09.519]  It happened all so quickly.
[00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.621]  So you think that these guys had a problem with Andrew because he was dating a African American?
[00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:15.422]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:17.043]  That simple.
[00:05:17.443 --> 00:05:23.786]  Even going back to slavery, how much white people just absolutely hated black people without a cause.
[00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:28.728]  They were hating black people even though they were getting free labor out of black people.
[00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:30.869]  They hated black people for no reason.
[00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:34.124]  You go all the way up until the Klansmen days.
[00:05:34.444 --> 00:05:35.645]  They hated black people.
[00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:38.827]  Black people had not done anything to whites.
[00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:40.488]  They hated them.
[00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.274]  You look at the civil rights movement, the way they were sticking dogs on them, lynching black people for no apparent reason.
[00:05:48.655 --> 00:05:51.617]  The hate is just sickening when you watch it.
[00:05:52.594 --> 00:05:54.175]  I mean, I almost get ill.
[00:05:54.535 --> 00:06:02.701]  I get so pissed off when I watch the way that white racists hated blacks back then and blacks have not had done anything to them but be black.
[00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:07.184]  But now we have a new kind of hatred.
[00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:12.067]  It's the way that black people hate white people.
[00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.351]  And I've paid attention to this over the years.
[00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:26.375]  In the last four years, I've always said this, but even before Barack Obama got in office, but it has just manifested itself.
[00:06:26.876 --> 00:06:34.704]  The type of hate, when you talk to blacks, the type of hate they have towards whites, for no reason, you ask them, has any white ever done you like this?
[00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:39.889]  The amount of hate they have for whites, for no reason, is unprecedented.
[00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.931]  It's ungodly.
[00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:42.172]  It's sickening.
[00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:46.019]  It reminds you of the day when the Klan hated black people.
[00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:50.025]  There is inevitably going to be some negative reaction.
[00:06:51.187 --> 00:06:53.971]  And it'll make for good TV.
[00:06:54.582 --> 00:07:00.667]  All kinds of things I can't even say on TV because the left does not want black conservatives to be vocal.
[00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:12.317]  I wrote Black Lash to expose the failures of the progressives and also to push back on the black liberal establishment whose message is about wealth redistribution and race baiting.
[00:07:12.637 --> 00:07:21.845]  Here we have the MSNBC characters like Tore and Al Sharpton who are spewing this nonsense daily and nightly on this network
[00:07:22.205 --> 00:07:23.665]  And it's absolutely outrageous.
[00:07:23.725 --> 00:07:26.266]  Joining me now is Toure and Michelle Bernard.
[00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:27.706]  Thank you both for being here.
[00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:28.467]  Thank you for having me.
[00:07:28.487 --> 00:07:29.167]  Thank you.
[00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:30.447]  Toure, what do you think of this?
[00:07:30.827 --> 00:07:39.149]  Well, you know, when they talk about entitlements, I find it very offensive because they're talking about, it's a coded way of saying welfare, of saying gifts, right?
[00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:40.449]  They talked about freebies there.
[00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:41.109]  Coded?
[00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.530]  Barely coded.
[00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.970]  I thought it was pretty blatant.
[00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.930]  Absolutely.
[00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:51.372]  The foundation of this country is racism and white supremacy, and we are, all of our institutions uphold that.
[00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:52.719]  Depressing.
[00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:53.479]  See now, as long
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:30.803]  As they kill us and go to Wendy's and have a burger and go to sleep, they're gonna keep killing us.
[00:08:33.464 --> 00:08:47.790]  But when we die and they die, then soon we're gonna sit at a table and talk about retirement!
[00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.511]  We want some of this earth!
[00:08:57.419 --> 00:09:01.660]  Obama has done good things as president.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:07.002]  Most of us don't notice those things because he has done them under the radar.
[00:09:07.242 --> 00:09:09.163]  We have this governmental structure.
[00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:18.246]  You can't wish it away by hoping for somebody who has passion, who has left convictions, who is this or who is that.
[00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:19.726]  We got Obama.
[00:09:20.567 --> 00:09:21.227]  Not bad.
[00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:23.219]  Not bad at all!
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:30.442]  It seems to me that there are three ways that oppressed people can deal with their oppression.
[00:09:30.542 --> 00:09:31.702]  What are they, Dr. King?
[00:09:32.663 --> 00:09:38.445]  Well, one is to rise up in open violence, in physical violence.
[00:09:39.485 --> 00:09:43.106]  Some persons have used that method, persons who have been oppressed.
[00:09:44.027 --> 00:09:47.368]  I think the danger of that method is its futility.
[00:09:47.568 --> 00:09:48.168]  I feel that
[00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:52.598]  Violence creates many more social problems than it solves.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.601]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:10:04.901 --> 00:10:07.162]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:17.185]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:10:17.505 --> 00:10:25.667]  That's why we're rolling out on 100% made-in-America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:10:25.947 --> 00:10:28.449]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
