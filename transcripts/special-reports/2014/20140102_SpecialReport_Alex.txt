[00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:15.844]  As we begin 2014, we need to understand that the NSA is celebrating 1984.
[00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:20.226]  Remember that iconic Apple commercial from 1984 where they introduced the Mac?
[00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:51.999]  Recently, secret slides from the NSA surfaced bragging about how they could hack iPhones.
[00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.202]  And they say, who knew in 1984 that this would be Big Brother?
[00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:00.284]  And that the zombies would be paying customers.
[00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:04.567]  That's right, the people doing this to you see this as Orwellian.
[00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:06.608]  Yet, they identify with Big Brother.
[00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:10.071]  They gloat about what they're doing to you, the zombies.
[00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:16.375]  You buy a piece of technology that has private personal uses, and they turn it into a tool of surveillance.
[00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:17.836]  Should we be surprised?
[00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:24.500]  We see a major contractor for the Orwellian state that names itself after Palantir from the Lord of the Rings.
[00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:28.243]  They identify with the evil all-seeing eye.
[00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:36.668]  And decades ago, the NSA had people like Michael Aquino, open Satan worshiper, satanic cult leader who wrote Mind War.
[00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:43.273]  And when allegations of child molestation surfaced, the NSA paid off the families of the alleged victims and relocated him.
[00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:58.279]  What emerges is that the NSA rank and file brag about the Orwellian state they've created, while they have leadership that uses satanic cult leaders to push mind control, openly lies to the public, threatens to kill anyone who exposes their agenda.
[00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:11.631]  The NSA calls the American public zombies because the American public has not been able to believe that this kind of technology existed or they naively trusted the government thinking that the American government would never aspire to be Big Brother.
[00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.473]  To create a totalitarian surveillance state.
[00:02:14.774 --> 00:02:17.716]  They promise us security if we'll only give up our liberty.
[00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:20.699]  They promise us security if we'll give up our privacy.
[00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.340]  It's a trade I would be willing to make.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.121]  Security and liberty.
[00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:25.924]  Security and privacy.
[00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:28.406]  But do you know what they call the harshest prisons in the country?
[00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:31.669]  Maximum security.
[00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:49.369]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:57.695]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:02.519]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:09.446]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:16.573]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:23.560]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
