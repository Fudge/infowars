[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:02.714]  Yeah, but we the people said no.
[00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:04.257]  Why are they still trying to push this through?
[00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:05.278]  These people aren't elected.
[00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:06.200]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.001]  That's treason, sir.
[00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.224]  You understand that?
[00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:10.227]  Agenda 21, that's from the United Nations.
[00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:32.031]  Dan Badundi, fame4wars.com, and we're in Providence, Rhode Island, where unelected officials have just taken it upon themselves to push through a draconian bill called Roadmap Rhode Island.
[00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:41.914]  And Roadmap Rhode Island is nothing more than the United Nations Agenda 21, and they did this without the approval of the elected officials or the registered voters.
[00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:51.857]  We have towns and communities that have land that will be impacted, property that will be impacted, and if you put large groups of
[00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:56.616]  Subsidized housing by who, by the way, get their money from the taxpayers.
[00:00:56.656 --> 00:01:02.998]  So, indirectly, we are paying for all of this, and our children will continue to pay for it.
[00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:13.881]  It feels like we're going to be sodomized for the rest of our lives by big government, big brother, and if you take money from these people, you're going to be married to them for the rest of your life.
[00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:14.641]  Your community.
[00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:15.241]  Our community.
[00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.442]  Our community.
[00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:21.883]  I do not agree with the accusations.
[00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:27.086]  I can understand how people have been misled by things that have been said.
[00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:58.914]  It's very unfortunate, and I think that the people who have started the misinformation should be held accountable as well.
[00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:03.316]  I will vote in support because I believe it's a good plan.
[00:02:03.336 --> 00:02:04.537]  It's just your paycheck.
[00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:07.119]  No, it's not my paycheck.
[00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:09.780]  I have zero job security, just so they can know.
[00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.682]  I will vote for this plan because I think it's a good plan.
[00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:13.723]  It's just a plan.
[00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:15.604]  It doesn't rewrite the Constitution.
[00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.454]  But it's something that I think will help Rhode Island move in a direction different from the one that you're unhappy with right now.
[00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:24.155]  Thank you.
[00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.445]  We helped the communities with HUD money.
[00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:41.648]  But doesn't this money come with strings attached to it?
[00:02:42.548 --> 00:02:43.469]  Strings attached?
[00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.071]  As in what kind of development is subsidized or supported?
[00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.232]  It's all local growing.
[00:02:49.632 --> 00:02:56.499]  When we went to East Natick or to Connecticut, those communities weren't eligible for CDGB money.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.982]  It was the neighbors that came and said, we want a sidewalk.
[00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:00.263]  We want better drainage.
[00:03:00.283 --> 00:03:01.124]  And that's what we did.
[00:03:01.204 --> 00:03:10.954]  But this plan, in order to access some of... Oakland Beach, East Natick... If the road map arrives, will this plan require that communities adhere to HUD standards in order to
[00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:13.677]  Well, there's some standards.
[00:03:13.857 --> 00:03:15.279]  I mean, you can't waste the money.
[00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.144]  It has to be spent according to wise parameters.
[00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:24.768]  There's some good government standards.
[00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:25.149]  No, no, no.
[00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.471]  The courts have ruled on behalf of property taxpayers over and over again.
[00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:36.961]  Excuse me, on private property.
[00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:38.602]  Where's the vote of the people?
[00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:39.263]  Over and over again.
[00:03:39.343 --> 00:03:42.526]  I know, I've dealt with zoning at the local level for many, many years.
[00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:49.092]  All the private property issues in the courts are very strong on protecting private property, as they continue, will continue to be.
[00:03:49.112 --> 00:03:52.916]  Are you saying the story about the handicapped ramp at the lady's house in Ohio?
[00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:54.298]  I don't know, I don't know.
[00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:57.320]  The bike ramp went right in front of somebody's house, I suppose there's some...
[00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:08.011]  I don't want to refute, I think it's Mr. Steinhaus's story, but it seemed not common to what I've encountered here in Rhode Island.
[00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:11.735]  Are you surprised at the local constitutionality of this project, sir?
[00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:13.196]  Why isn't the people voting on this?
[00:04:14.197 --> 00:04:15.239]  I'm an elected official.
[00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:16.941]  Are you surprised at the vocal opposition today?
[00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:36.126]  Yes, because we've worked so hard to have public input over the last 18 months.
[00:04:36.606 --> 00:04:39.708]  A lot of outreach, as you heard, some testimony.
[00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:44.532]  I heard about it, I came out, I participated, I was welcomed immediately into the dialogue.
[00:04:45.392 --> 00:04:51.376]  So, of course, they're here today, and that's good, expressing their opinion, so on we go.
[00:04:51.796 --> 00:04:53.578]  Governor, why do you think people are against this plan?
[00:04:54.038 --> 00:04:55.359]  There's some against it and some for it.
[00:04:55.739 --> 00:05:00.023]  I was very happy to hear those that are expressing their opinions.
[00:05:00.043 --> 00:05:01.004]  We're a lot in favor.
[00:05:01.404 --> 00:05:03.146]  I'm sure if you were here, you've heard those also.
[00:05:03.226 --> 00:05:05.147]  Is this not a violation of the Constitution, sir?
[00:05:05.268 --> 00:05:05.948]  In the domain?
[00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:06.869]  Yes, it is, sir.
[00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:07.529]  It's treason.
[00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:10.232]  Then there'd be lawyers taking us to court.
[00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:11.373]  No, this is treason, sir.
[00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:13.194]  This is Agenda 21 by the United Nations.
[00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:13.915]  We are onto this.
[00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:15.455]  Governor, are you ready?
[00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:16.576]  That's high treason, sir.
[00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:22.040]  That's the Governor of Rhode Island, folks.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.003]  These people here are supporting high treason against the Constitution of the United States.
[00:05:26.983 --> 00:05:28.704]  Private property rights are trying to distinct.
[00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:32.727]  No, no, of course not.
[00:05:32.747 --> 00:05:33.568]  Stay there, Governor.
[00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:37.638]  We the people, Governor, not we the officials.
[00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:42.202]  We the people.
[00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:43.843]  The Constitution comes for us.
[00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:46.406]  We will not comply with the rule of Macquarie Island.
[00:05:46.426 --> 00:05:49.809]  How are you an investigative reporter and challenging him about we the people?
[00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:52.691]  Because this is pure unconstitutional, ma'am.
[00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:53.913]  What's unconstitutional, Governor?
[00:05:53.993 --> 00:05:54.773]  Imminent domain.
[00:05:54.974 --> 00:05:55.694]  I mean, do you not know?
[00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:58.877]  There's nothing in the plan that talks about imminent domain.
[00:05:58.897 --> 00:06:00.719]  There's a lot in the plan that talks about that.
[00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:04.587]  That's a good thing.
[00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:07.650]  So I plan to vote in favor of the plan.
[00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:12.995]  So with that, I'll take a motion to approve the plan.
[00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:15.738]  Mr. Flores, Marzine, you have a motion?
[00:06:16.378 --> 00:06:22.604]  Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to adopt the State of Rhode Island draft Rhode Island economic development plan.
[00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:23.845]  That's moving to the future.
[00:06:24.864 --> 00:06:25.964]  Motion's been made.
[00:06:26.064 --> 00:06:27.565]  Is there a second on the motion?
[00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:30.766]  Director Lewis seconds the motion to approve the plan.
[00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:33.767]  Is there any further discussion from the council at this time?
[00:06:35.187 --> 00:06:36.908]  Hearing none, I will call the roll.
[00:06:38.248 --> 00:06:41.909]  And Rhode Island has just witnessed today the birth of Agenda 21.
[00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:50.112]  Agenda 21 is the action plan to destroy your sovereignty, and that is your personal sovereignty and your national sovereignty.
[00:06:50.472 --> 00:06:53.233]  This is the green mask, the environmental mask,
[00:06:53.653 --> 00:06:58.975]  Because if you are terrified that you're killing the planet, you will be willing to accept any restriction.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.640]  No comment.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.241]  No comment?
[00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:22.243]  You should wear a Nazi lapel next time you come into a press conference.
[00:07:22.263 --> 00:07:25.644]  Because all you support is a communist, Nazi agenda 21.
[00:07:25.684 --> 00:07:27.745]  We don't trust the government.
[00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:28.406]  We're tired.
[00:07:28.426 --> 00:07:30.207]  Well, here's one that just sold us out right here.
[00:07:30.227 --> 00:07:33.088]  Can you make a comment on how you saw the press conference?
[00:07:33.108 --> 00:07:34.549]  Oh, hey, well, I tell you what, you're not
[00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:41.593]  You're not representing all of the voters in your area.
[00:07:41.633 --> 00:07:53.881]  Because I tell you what, when you get up and you say you represent the people in Southeast Iowa, you don't hit again when the pensions of the old people... I'm 77, my brother is 73.
[00:07:56.102 --> 00:08:06.593]  When you go in and because of a puddle, Hud wants to come in and get a puddle or standing water for 40 days or a pond.
[00:08:06.813 --> 00:08:08.015]  They need that pond.
[00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:09.716]  You've got a lot to learn.
[00:08:10.037 --> 00:08:12.820]  And I tell you what, I'm going to be there to teach you.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.001]  My book, Behind the Green Mask, is a great way to educate yourself.
[00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:19.722]  You want to give this information to your legislators.
[00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:22.123]  Let them know about this if they don't know.
[00:08:22.443 --> 00:08:29.865]  And if they aren't willing to refuse to go along with the federal grants, with the plans, with the projects, then take them out.
[00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:31.385]  Remove them from office.
[00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:32.706]  And do this locally.
[00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:41.066]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:43.427]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:08:43.587 --> 00:08:46.228]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:50.390]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.871]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:08:53.891 --> 00:09:01.134]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:09:01.334 --> 00:09:05.437]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:07.298]  We are the true media.
[00:09:07.438 --> 00:09:10.060]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.803]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
