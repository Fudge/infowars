[00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:17.385]  We're out here on the streets trying to find answers to a Washington Times article that states that the President has the right to use military force against civilians domestically and also the use of drones.
[00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:18.386]  Here's what they had to say.
[00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:29.270]  Alright, the Washington Times just posted an article and it outlines a directive written in 2010 that gives the President the authority to use military action against civilians domestically and the use of drones.
[00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.310]  How does that make you feel?
[00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.212]  I'm not sure, to be perfectly honest.
[00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:36.333]  Feels betrayed, really.
[00:00:37.657 --> 00:00:38.298]  Pretty angry.
[00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:41.220]  I mean, but that's what our president does.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.121]  Uh, not very good.
[00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:48.385]  Um, I didn't hear about that, and I think at this point I'll just not comment.
[00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:50.107]  Doesn't really surprise me.
[00:00:50.127 --> 00:00:52.528]  I mean, how does that make you feel, though?
[00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.331]  As an American, that our president's signing a directive like that.
[00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:57.512]  No comment, thank you.
[00:00:57.552 --> 00:00:58.333]  Wow, that's pretty scary.
[00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:03.977]  I don't know, that's... It's kind of scary, basically.
[00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:05.458]  Not good.
[00:01:05.478 --> 00:01:06.359]  I don't like that.
[00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:07.494]  Scared.
[00:01:07.514 --> 00:01:08.916]  And violated.
[00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:13.121]  You know, you know, you know how I feel about all this.
[00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:15.425]  It's out of my control anyway.
[00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.232]  So you don't have an opinion?
[00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:21.332]  You're an American citizen.
[00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:23.613]  He's out of my control.
[00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.374]  You're not asking objectively.
[00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:32.577]  Okay, so how does it make you feel that the president has signed a directive saying that he can use military force against you and drones?
[00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:33.438]  How does it make you feel?
[00:01:33.558 --> 00:01:37.319]  It makes me feel horrible and I think it's retarded that you don't have an opinion on it and you're an American.
[00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:38.600]  I think it's shameful.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.961]  That's a very objective point of view, right?
[00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:42.482]  I mean, but you're so chillaxed about it.
[00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:46.506]  I mean, it doesn't offend you that our Commander-in-Chief wants to... You know what?
[00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:49.008]  I'm not gonna be... I'm not gonna be offended.
[00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.112]  Because... That's okay, then you guys... You can proceed on to the next.
[00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:53.752]  Okay, yeah.
[00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:54.973]  Well, it's just... I think it's ridiculous.
[00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:57.095]  You guys enjoy living your sheep life.
[00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.658]  Fortunately, like, get a new job.
[00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:01.459]  No, no, you just need to be an American.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.941]  I'm gonna live my simple life.
[00:02:04.342 --> 00:02:05.283]  Okay, it is simple.
[00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:07.768]  You're ridiculous, man.
[00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.792]  And have you heard, too, that the USDA purchased submachine guns?
[00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:14.354]  Yeah, I hear all these agencies are arming up.
[00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:14.994]  Yeah, the U.S.
[00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:17.196]  Postal Service just spent... Department of Education, I heard?
[00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:17.497]  Yeah.
[00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:19.398]  I mean, what do you think all this means?
[00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:22.281]  I mean, you put all these pieces together, what's the outcome?
[00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:23.882]  Well, it's pretty ominous.
[00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:28.927]  We always have to hope that the people in power
[00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:35.832]  We can trust in the good people, but I'd rather have a system that's robust enough to withstand somebody that isn't good being in power.
[00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:40.194]  I mean, did you know that the USDA purchased submachine guns?
[00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:42.074]  I mean, what does the USDA need that for?
[00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:43.995]  I don't even know what the USDA is.
[00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:46.315]  The United States Department of Agriculture.
[00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:51.076]  You know, when you get a stake or whatever, it says USDA, a grade A or whatever like that?
[00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:54.057]  I guess to go shoot down 5,000 pound cows or something.
[00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:57.318]  Do you think though, do you think that our government is ramping up or something?
[00:02:58.432 --> 00:02:58.972]  Against us?
[00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:00.073]  I hope not.
[00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:04.695]  I don't want to think that, but... I mean, the police are buying tanks and getting things like that.
[00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:08.237]  You know, it's getting to be where everyone else has more rights than us.
[00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:10.258]  I mean, it makes me scared.
[00:03:10.318 --> 00:03:18.823]  It makes me feel like, you know, the government's after us, not really foreign, you know, terrorism or anything like that.
[00:03:19.163 --> 00:03:23.445]  So you don't feel that the president has your best needs at hand at all?
[00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:24.606]  You don't think that he has your back?
[00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:25.623]  Absolutely not.
[00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:29.704]  I think that it's not just Obama that is making these decisions.
[00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:32.025]  I think Congress has a big, you know, play in it.
[00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:36.407]  And like I said, even though I support Obama, I don't support that decision.
[00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:38.787]  Do you think our president has our best interests at hand?
[00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:46.350]  Well, I'm sure he does what he can, but it's not, he does not own all the power, you know.
[00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:50.032]  Any more presidents kind of a figurehead?
[00:03:50.392 --> 00:04:01.318]  I think that there are a lot of things that the government does and going on that we don't know about and that people should be able to learn more about and have these questions answered.
[00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:01.378]  So...
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.823]  I think that's definitely an issue among many other issues that go on with the government.
[00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:12.626]  As an American citizen, you have to respect our president, whether I like it or not.
[00:04:12.646 --> 00:04:14.347]  It's really not my decision.
[00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:16.988]  Being an American, it pisses me the s*** off.
[00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:17.969]  I ain't gonna lie about it.
[00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.911]  And I got a problem with that, and I'd take up arms against them if they do some s***.
[00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:24.132]  I mean, do you think the president has your best interests at hand?
[00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:24.433]  No.
[00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:24.913]  Not at all.
[00:04:24.953 --> 00:04:25.253]  Exactly.
[00:04:25.413 --> 00:04:25.613]  No.
[00:04:25.773 --> 00:04:29.335]  Yeah, I really don't know what to believe or what to... I don't know the motives.
[00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:30.176]  Mind blown.
[00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:33.958]  The facts are in.
[00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:35.279]  The studies are legion.
[00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:42.886]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:46.530]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.310]  Simple.
[00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.875]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:55.418]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:57.640]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.264]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:13.933]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
