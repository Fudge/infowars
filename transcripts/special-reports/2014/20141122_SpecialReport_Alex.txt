[00:00:08.627 --> 00:00:17.320]  A convenience store confrontation ended in tragedy after a man suspected of being in the country illegally approached and stabbed a college football player to death.
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.811]  Police in McMinnville, Oregon are still baffled as to why 33-year-old Juventino Bermudez-Arenas
[00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:31.895]  Attacked 20-year-old Linfield College student Parker Moore after entering a 7-Eleven convenience store last Saturday night.
[00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:41.901]  Police, however, say when Bermudez-Arenas went back to the store, he allegedly refused orders to drop a knife in his possession, prompting police to open fire on him, killing him dead.
[00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:50.747]  Bermudez-Arenas' family is also puzzled as to why he might have carried out the violent attack, as he reportedly did not have mental health issues.
[00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.350]  Use drugs or drink and was not involved in gang activity.
[00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.114]  Yesterday investigators revealed Bermudez-Aranes was likely living in the U.S.
[00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:02.577]  illegally, though he'd worked in the country since at least the year 2000.
[00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:09.103]  During a previous run-in with the law, he had given police a variation of his name, Juan Antino Bermudez.
[00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:14.208]  Police say there is no connection between Moore and his assailant and that the attack appeared to be random.
[00:01:14.488 --> 00:01:17.231]  Moore was a college student majoring in business management.
[00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:28.418]  He was also a resident advisor and linebacker with the Linfield Wildcats, which just proceeded to the NCAA Division III playoffs after a shutout victory on Saturday.
[00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:30.119]  Man of character.
[00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:31.660]  Extremely talented.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.342]  Three factors that are really hard to find when recruiting guys.
[00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:41.486]  And every coach that we had on our staff fell in love with Parker the minute we met him.
[00:01:42.048 --> 00:01:45.170]  An investigation into the incident is still ongoing.
[00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.133]  It is not clear if Bermudez-Arenas had ever come into contact with federal immigration agencies.
[00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:55.015]  In fact, we're just beginning to recognize how much pain there is.
