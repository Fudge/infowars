[00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:15.419]  With so many examples of armed self-defense barely making the news, here are the top 10 highlights of 2014 thus far.
[00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.741]  We'll start in the city of Chicago.
[00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:21.323]  A homeowner shot an intruder in the early morning hours.
[00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:28.308]  Unfortunately, due to the city's strict gun laws, the homeowner was arrested for having an expired weapons permit.
[00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:33.275]  A Florida man learned the hard way not to bring a knife to a gunfight.
[00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:38.797]  The attacker entered a supermarket armed with a sword and was shot by a security guard.
[00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:44.398]  In North Carolina, a thief playing doctor was chased off by an armed homeowner.
[00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.060]  The crook disguised in a surgeon's mask was quickly caught a short distance later.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.241]  Next, we'll focus on attacking the elderly.
[00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:59.663]  In Thurston County, Washington, a 63-year-old shot a stranger inside his home, attempting to carry away the man's property.
[00:01:00.163 --> 00:01:04.484]  In Phoenix, a 77-year-old awoke to a burglar inside his home.
[00:01:04.924 --> 00:01:08.525]  The burglar was shot dead by a single shotgun blast.
[00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:15.367]  Rounding out the top five, a California woman in a nightgown chased off two thugs with her shotgun.
[00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:17.328]  She heard the suspect say this,
[00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:21.165]  He said that crazy bitch has a gun.
[00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:26.406]  In Detroit, a mother defended her family against three simultaneous attackers.
[00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:30.807]  The woman fired on the fleeing suspects who were later caught the same day.
[00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:34.448]  For the top three, we'll focus on sharpshooting skills.
[00:01:35.068 --> 00:01:40.090]  In Washington State, an 11-year-old shot and killed a cougar stalking her brother.
[00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.551]  The cat was one of four that appeared on her family property in the past month.
[00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:50.193]  In San Jose, a man shot and hit two men attempting to break into his home.
[00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:55.915]  But the kicker is that the man couldn't see his targets and fired at the sound of the intruders.
[00:01:56.495 --> 00:02:02.657]  And topping the list, a sharpshooting son killed a man menacing his father from 40 yards away.
[00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:07.634]  That's when all I saw was this guy coming up out of the ditch with a gun and he put that gun on my dad.
[00:02:08.334 --> 00:02:09.655]  I just jumped out and put it on him.
[00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:12.957]  There's still blood on the ground where the burglar was shot.
[00:02:13.338 --> 00:02:14.398]  He was gonna kill my dad.
[00:02:14.578 --> 00:02:15.619]  That's no doubt about that.
[00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:16.660]  He was gonna kill my dad.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.981]  The homeowner is proud of his son.
[00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:23.044]  His son says he'll protect his family no matter the cost.
[00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.927]  I was scared for my dad's life and I wasn't gonna have my dad die in front of me.
[00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:31.169]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com
[00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:45.213]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:47.794]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:57.798]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.

[00:03:06.543 --> 00:03:09.084]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:03:09.504 --> 00:03:13.746]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:15.027]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.789]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.092]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:24.913]  We're good to go.
