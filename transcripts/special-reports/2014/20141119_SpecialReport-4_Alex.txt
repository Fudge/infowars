[00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:18.401]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com here at the Metro Shooting Supplies in Bridgeton, Missouri with Stephen King.
[00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:26.368]  Now, in light of the verdict, it's supposed to be any day now, we've gotten information that gun sales in the area have gone up.
[00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:27.509]  Has that been true here?
[00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:28.189]  Yeah, about 300%.
[00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:31.761]  So how many people, what are they buying mostly?
[00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:33.022]  Shotguns?
[00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:33.602]  Handguns?
[00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.282]  What's the big seller?
[00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:42.163]  Right now it's personal defense handguns, AR-15 style modern sporting rifles, and home defense pump shotguns.
[00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:46.864]  And is that the reason I saw a few of your signs saying that the ammo is limited?
[00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:48.244]  A lot of people are buying it up right now.
[00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:51.305]  Yeah, the ammunition shortage is starting to kick in.
[00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:53.245]  Thank God we've never run out.
[00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:55.305]  Now, you guys are in Bridgeton.
[00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:57.526]  That's a little bit further away from Ferguson.
[00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.086]  Do you think there's going to be any kind of
[00:00:59.617 --> 00:01:01.438]  uproar of violence in this area per se?
[00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:02.758]  Well, we're six miles away.
[00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:13.242]  We are told through social media that there's no store, no neighborhood, nobody's clear from any type of protesting.
[00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:16.603]  They said that they're going to make sure that the entire St.
[00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:18.503]  Louis region is affected by this.
[00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:26.426]  We have seen a lot of police officers coming in and practicing, you know, shooting extra range time, checking their equipment, making sure everything's functioning.
[00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:30.828]  We have sold a lot of policemen's family members firearms.
[00:01:31.828 --> 00:01:36.010]  Let's face it, they've been told for three months to prepare for the worst.
[00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:44.034]  So as far as keeping your store secure and safe, are you going to have people here throughout the night or do you board up anything like that?
[00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:44.454]  What do you do?
[00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:53.097]  I'm not going to give away a strategy, so if they want to check and see if we're in here in the middle of the night, that's up to them to come in and maybe get a big surprise.
[00:01:53.417 --> 00:02:04.419]  There's a lot of people out there that are opportunity seekers, and they're out here to destroy businesses and loot and burglarize and make out for personal gain.
[00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:06.739]  This has nothing to do with Michael Brown.
[00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.720]  It has nothing to do at all, and it's just something that's a byproduct of any type of tragedy like this.
[00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:15.839]  Now in your personal opinion, what do you think is going to happen with this outcome?
[00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:23.029]  I personally believe that Darren Wilson is going to be found, there's going to be a no true bill, they're not going to indict him.
[00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.554]  I think he's going to go, they're going to find that he used justifiable force.
[00:02:27.654 --> 00:02:30.458]  The word is though, this is going to be worse than the Rodney King riots.
[00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:33.636]  Back in L.A., do you think it's going to escalate to that or even worse?
[00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:03.116]  That's what people do for sporting events.
[00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:03.736]  That's what I mean.
[00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:14.926]  If they're going to riot when they're happy their team won the basketball championship, then they're going to be happy that he got indicted and go burn cars and flip over cars and loot businesses.
[00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.228]  My prayer is that we
[00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:24.973]  We hear what the grand jury gets, we accept what the grand jury says, and that we figure out ways that we can all live together with this verdict.
[00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:28.216]  And as long as they're doing peaceful protesting, that's fine.
[00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:29.677]  That's what demonstrations are all about.
[00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:35.081]  But when they start breaking the law, I think that the police are going to have to come in and quash it pretty quickly.
[00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:37.042]  Well, there you have it.
[00:03:37.122 --> 00:03:41.145]  We're here once again at the Metro Shooting Supplies in Bridgeton, Missouri.
[00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:43.287]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:58.123]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:08.331]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.394]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:15.796]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:04:17.978 --> 00:04:24.206]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
