[00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:18.900]  This is Anthony Gucciardi with a message of victory and success, not only for the free flow of information and the defense of our rights, but a testament to the power of the free press and the alternative real media.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:32.525]  Now specifically, I'm talking about an article published yesterday on StoryLeak, my website, and syndicated up on Infowars.com called, Connecticut Cop, I Will Kick Down Doors to Confiscate Guns.
[00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.526]  That's a real quote from him.
[00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:44.695]  Now this is from a Kyle Thelen, a key writer for StoryLeak and also InfoWars, and what we found was there is a former Navy veteran who is also a firefighter.
[00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:54.914]  And he was saying, hey, you know, I'm not going to register my gun in Connecticut, as they were asking citizens to do, so they could track them and ultimately lead to confiscation, according to some of their plans.
[00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:58.916]  Now, he was saying that, but that was concerning enough.
[00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:01.318]  That made national news in some ways.
[00:01:01.738 --> 00:01:05.261]  But the real story that we found in an exclusive interview,
[00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:18.638]  was that one of the most highly decorated police officers in Connecticut in Brantford County, Brantford Police, was saying he cannot wait to kick down your door and confiscate your guns.
[00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:25.785]  Now specifically, we got an interview with the former Navy veteran as well as the current firefighter
[00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:38.974]  And he was speaking specifically to Joseph Peterson, the officer, who now, by the way, since we've covered this, and this is the key element of all of this, the key victory point, has been placed on leave.
[00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:43.017]  He has deleted all of his social media accounts, and he's now retracting all of his statements.
[00:01:43.377 --> 00:01:48.921]  Now, he hasn't officially said anything, but we have confirmed with the police in the area that he's been put on leave.
[00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:50.382]  And they're issuing statements.
[00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:54.565]  It's all over the news in local area Connecticut and it is making waves.
[00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:58.047]  Has 18,000 shares on Facebook.
[00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:00.669]  Super beyond viral on StoryLeak alone.
[00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.471]  InfoWars is growing even higher.
[00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:10.937]  So overall this story is major, major news and I wanted to make this victory message as a testament to the power of the alternative media.
[00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:13.982]  Now specifically, in the Facebook message, look at this.
[00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:23.640]  A highly decorated officer, this guy named Joseph Peterson says, in a vulgar way, I give my left nut to bang down your door and come for your gun.
[00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:30.178]  And then he started talking about, you know, it's not a Nazi policy to take the guns, you thick-headed idiot.
[00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:31.539]  It's a state statute.
[00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:36.721]  I don't come to your job to tell you how to do yours when he was protesting gun confiscation.
[00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:40.904]  If the fries ain't done, I just step out of line.
[00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:42.765]  So he's saying, hey, don't tell me how to do my job.
[00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:44.005]  Who cares about the Constitution?
[00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.266]  I'll come kick down your door.
[00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:50.068]  I'd give my left testicle to come knock down your door and break in and steal your gun.
[00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:58.084]  Basically, the cop goes on to say, if my department gets warrants to do this, and we have to serve them, I will see you then.
[00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.689]  And he talks about how he would love to kick down his door and take his guns.
[00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:10.936]  I've had contact with a police officer in my home town, I live in Brantford, and his words straight out were, I cannot wait to get the order to kick your door in.
[00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:19.618]  Now, over and over again we've heard similar statements, sometimes from political officials, and over and over again we've managed to crush them by exposing them in the light.
[00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:22.499]  Because the reality is, less than 6% of Americans, actually it's 4%,
[00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.101]  I actually think gun control is a forefront issue right now.
[00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:33.745]  In fact, a way larger percentage, I think it's 16%, think the overall government corruption and insane establishment is the number one issue.
[00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:36.247]  Others think it's the economy, according to Gallup polls.
[00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:51.376]  Now, in the past we've exposed Monsanto, we've exposed DuPont, Syngenta, we've exposed a wide variety of these things, all the way to DHS tracking systems, constitution-free zones, everything, and we've managed to squash it every single time by bringing it to light.
[00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:57.277]  This is one of those times, and I think we need to make this even bigger, to fight the issue of gun confiscation.
[00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:00.658]  Because the reality is there are more officers out there who are so delusional.
[00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:02.438]  We need to bring all this to light.
[00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:09.560]  Any political official that supports knocking down your door to confiscate your guns is not someone who is following the Constitution, obviously.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.340]  These are criminals.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.721]  And it's amazing what we've done just by writing this simple article, Mikhail Phelan, on Story Lake, on Infowars.
[00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:19.342]  And this is a message, this is a message of success.
[00:04:20.603 --> 00:04:23.807]  18,000 shares just on Story Lake right now, growing even larger on InfoWars.
[00:04:24.248 --> 00:04:29.495]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi encouraging you to spread the word and join the fight because we can achieve success.
[00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:38.594]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:04:38.914 --> 00:04:41.175]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:51.198]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:59.680]  That's why we're rolling out on 100% made-in-America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.462]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:07.124]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:08.405]  We are the spirit of 1776.
