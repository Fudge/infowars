[00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.194]  Is throwing a snowball worthy of a felony charge?
[00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:14.453]  Police in Chicago seem to think so, as a 13-year-old has been charged with aggravated battery to a police officer for allegedly tossing the icy projectile, a charge that the boy denies.
[00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.572]  In Georgia, no one is denying that a 17-year-old future Marine was killed when he opened his front door for an officer.
[00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:30.795]  Witnesses say that the officer, there to serve a warrant for the boy's father, fired upon the teen who was holding a Nintendo Wii controller.
[00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.636]  Police claim that the teen was holding a gun at the time of the incident.
[00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:37.117]  The shooting is still under investigation.
[00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.034]  Police in Hawthorne, California beat a deaf man, reportedly mistaking his hand signs for aggression.
[00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:52.319]  Officers thought the hearing-impaired gentleman was stealing his own property and grabbed his arms, impairing his ability to communicate with his hands.
[00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.741]  The man was then tased and beaten by police, according to his attorney.
[00:00:57.162 --> 00:01:05.507]  We've seen that even filming police can get you into trouble, with reports of alleged assault from police for the simple act of filming police activities.
[00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:15.450]  Back in 2011, InfoWars reported on how police threatened to throw a man in prison for life for daring to film his encounter with the authorities.
[00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.752]  Eventually, the charges were dropped and the Supreme Court upheld the right to film police.
[00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:31.236]  Even though this right was solidified some years ago, last year women in Illinois were arrested for filming the installation of a smart meter, a smart meter that they did not desire.
[00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:40.346]  And on this topic of cameras, it's a good thing that cameras were rolling last week when a jogger was taken into custody by the Austin Police Department.
[00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:47.631]  The young woman was supposedly uncooperative when police attempted to intercept her for the heinous crime of jaywalking.
[00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:51.273]  Eyewitnesses state that the officers grabbed the woman from behind
[00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:51.974]  I think?
[00:02:12.837 --> 00:02:18.420]  They say that the man was allegedly at a bank to commit a fraud, but even if he was, that is not a capital offense.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.300]  But it's not all bad.
[00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:25.743]  Massachusetts police recently threw a surprise party for an autistic boy who had few friends.
[00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:27.584]  And we see these from time to time.
[00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:31.785]  Police playing football with the kids or buying the kids free ice cream cones and so forth.
[00:02:32.146 --> 00:02:34.106]  We need to see these type of things more often.
[00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:36.808]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.581]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:51.922]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:02:52.102 --> 00:03:00.406]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:16.012]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:16.712]  Let's go!
