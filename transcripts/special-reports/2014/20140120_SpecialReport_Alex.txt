[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:11.271]  UK blogger Tony Newberry stumbled across a $110,000 funding grant for a seminar that the UK government hoped would see its line on climate change promoted in BBC reporting.
[00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:18.272]  When he asked for more information under a Freedom of Information request, he was stonewalled by both the government and the BBC.
[00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:26.474]  The UK government has spent $33,000 in legal fees to cover up what was discussed at the seminars and conferences and to cover up who the attendees were.
[00:00:27.034 --> 00:00:39.560]  In addition, Lord Hall of Birkenhead, BBC Director General, in an effort to play down the government's use of the BBC as a propaganda outlet, has made statements that directly contradict the BBC's previous descriptions.
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.443]  In the BBC's words, it was a high-level seminar with some of the best scientific experts on climate change.
[00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:48.804]  But Birkenhead says the guests were not climate change experts.
[00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:55.988]  He also says they were not advising the BBC on what their approach to climate change should be, or how it should cover climate change.
[00:00:56.368 --> 00:01:13.462]  But the BBC says the seminar was held in order to provide attendees with an understanding of the existing state of knowledge on the issue of climate change, to identify where the main areas of debate lie, to provoke the imagination of the media to deal with the scope of the issue, and to consider the role of the BBC in the public debate.
[00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:22.169]  What emerges in this fight for information is a story of direct, explicit control of the media to push a false narrative that was unraveling by the mid-2000s.
[00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:33.924]  At about the same time the government was advising the BBC on how it could help spread alarm over carbon dioxide, people were filing FOIA requests from East Anglia University's Climate Research Unit.
[00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:39.532]  After four years of stonewalling, the government said that the data and the communications had been lost.
[00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.074]  They no longer existed.
[00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:49.091]  But someone on the inside, who knew the government and the climate research unit were lying, leaked the information on a Russian server.
[00:01:49.411 --> 00:02:00.760]  Those 1,000 emails, known as ClimateGate, showed that not only were some honest scientists concerned that the models were wrong, but that other scientists were conspiring to hide the decline.
[00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.795]  When the lies about the data no longer existing and the conspiracy to manipulate the data were exposed, ClimateGate caused quite a stir initially in 2009.
[00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:21.522]  But the same people who had attended the government conference on how to report climate issues were the same ones who, quote, debunked the ClimateGate emails, saying, move along, there's nothing to see here.
[00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:28.826]  An American, Michael Mann, originator of the hockey stick metaphor that Al Gore made famous, was involved in about 15% of the ClimateGate emails.
[00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:31.490]  Efforts in the U.S.
[00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:43.862]  to get access to emails written by man on University of Virginia computers with grants funded by taxpayers and used to create public policy met with the same kind of stonewalling and lies that have been seen in the U.K.
[00:02:44.103 --> 00:02:47.446]  that the documents had been destroyed when in fact they had not.
[00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.268]  What were they afraid of?
[00:02:50.148 --> 00:02:59.231]  Well, their efforts to hide the decline in global temperatures are now open for everyone to see, as are their dire predictions about the imminent disappearance of polar ice caps.
[00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:07.894]  There is a 17-year trend of global cooling in spite of record increases of carbon dioxide, what they call carbon.
[00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:13.441]  Both Al Gore and NASA scientists predicted that the polar ice caps would be gone by 2013.
[00:03:14.822 --> 00:03:28.112]  Yet, when UK climate scientists, accompanied by a BBC reporter, thought they could bolster their failing narrative by measuring ice in the Antarctic in the summer, they and their rescuers were trapped by record ice.
[00:03:28.472 --> 00:03:36.479]  The Gilligan's Iceland fiasco was spun as a weather aberration rather than a climate trend that matched 17 years of declining temperatures.
[00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:50.852]  The BBC dutifully reported that the Antarctic ice was only 1% above normal when in fact it was at record levels 15% above normal and the UN organization pushing global warming as a crisis can't explain it.
[00:03:51.912 --> 00:04:01.596]  The government is deliberately trying to push society into a fantasy crisis so that they can justify a global tax regime, create a scarcity of energy and gain
