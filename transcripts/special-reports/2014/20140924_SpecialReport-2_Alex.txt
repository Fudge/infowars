[00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:15.792]  Your point about ISIL adapting to the airstrikes is a good one.
[00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:18.034]  We have seen evidence that they're already doing that.
[00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:21.898]  We've seen that now as a result of the air campaign thus far in Iraq.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.242]  There are other ways to deliver precise
[00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:34.088]  That was a top general saying that ISIL has already adapted to the airstrikes by the U.S.
[00:00:34.308 --> 00:00:34.828]  and others.
[00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:42.454]  The Obama administration has led the way in attacking the terrorist group within Syria, but without Syrian President Assad's blessing.
[00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:46.497]  We've seen reports that Syrian civilians have died in these attacks.
[00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:52.621]  But top brass at the Pentagon have pledged to continue on with the attacks even if they have to change their methods.
[00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:58.824]  You are seeing the beginnings of a sustained campaign, and strikes like this in the future can be expected.
[00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:04.607]  So beyond ISIL, if these attacks continue, what will be the response of the Syrian military?
[00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:05.907]  And how will the U.S.
[00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:06.928]  react to that?
[00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:09.289]  And it's not as simple as everything the U.S.
[00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:11.610]  does is bad and everything Assad does is good.
[00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.291]  Assad isn't the greatest guy.
[00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:17.753]  But Assad isn't the one giving aid to Al Qaeda rebels who break off and form ISIS.
[00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:24.183]  So it seems to me to be a problem action solution that all benefits the military-industrial complex.

[00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:37.747]  The facts are in.
