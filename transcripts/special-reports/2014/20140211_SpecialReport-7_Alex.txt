[00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:12.515]  This is Ja'Kari Jackson at Times Square.
[00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:19.918]  I'm so pumped up, ready to report on the Super Bowl, but not the Super Bowl, about the Super Bowl taking away my constitutional rights, violating my fourth amendment.
[00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.499]  I'm so... Yeah!
[00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:23.779]  Super Bowl!
[00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.960]  Yeah!
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.620]  Go Broncos!
[00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:28.341]  Go Seahawks!
[00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:29.621]  Yeah!
[00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:33.543]  Violating my constitutional rights.
[00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:34.383]  Let's talk to these people.
[00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:35.844]  You excited about the Super Bowl?
[00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:38.329]  I'm a little bit excited.
[00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:40.030]  I'm a little disappointed I don't have tickets.
[00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.191]  You don't have tickets?
[00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:41.911]  No.
[00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:45.093]  We came here from Austin, Texas and we want to talk about the Super Bowl.
[00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:46.654]  Who are you guys going for in the Super Bowl?
[00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:47.474]  I'm going for the Broncos.
[00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:48.114]  Miami Heat!
[00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:50.115]  Okay, you're in the wrong game bro.
[00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.577]  Alright sir, tell me why the Seahawks are going to win.
[00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:57.979]  Russell Wilson and Cam Chamberlain.
[00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:59.700]  Why are the Broncos going to win this year?
[00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:03.294]  We're gonna, the defense is gonna play.
[00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.836]  They've been playing great for the last three or four weeks.
[00:01:06.497 --> 00:01:06.797]  Alright?
[00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:09.239]  And Peyton Manning always has a plan.
[00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:12.322]  Alright Spider-Man, you've been protecting New York for decades now.
[00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:14.864]  Do you feel safe with all these NYPD officers out here?
[00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:15.745]  Yeah, I do.
[00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:19.388]  The city never sleeps and the police do an excellent job.
[00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:21.170]  I feel, we feel safe.
[00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.371]  Well, I tell you man, don't you feel safe?
[00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:24.873]  I see the NYPD out here.
[00:01:25.213 --> 00:01:26.374]  I see all their cameras and all that.
[00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:27.334]  Does that make you feel safe?
[00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:30.377]  Yeah, and they have a good presence out here more than usual.
[00:01:30.577 --> 00:01:31.798]  I see you need money for weed.
[00:01:31.998 --> 00:01:33.119]  Why do you need money for weed?
[00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:42.066]  I need money for weed so I could have a good Super Bowl, have a few drinks, and my name is Vendetta.
[00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:44.823]  So what do you think about the Super Bowl security?
[00:01:44.863 --> 00:01:46.585]  They're going to have the TSA-style pat-downs.
[00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:49.768]  They're going to be patting you down, they're going to be checking your drinks, doing x-ray scans.
[00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:50.588]  Are you good with that, sir?
[00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:52.150]  Yes, sir, I can.
[00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.431]  Do what you have to do.
[00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:54.572]  Absolutely.
[00:01:54.612 --> 00:01:56.374]  That's the way it is nowadays.
[00:01:56.974 --> 00:01:57.214]  So?
[00:01:58.315 --> 00:01:59.937]  Once you're inside, you know you're alright.
[00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:05.382]  Yeah, so sir, if we have to do a full proctology exam to get in there to keep everybody safe, that's what we need to do.
[00:02:06.382 --> 00:02:07.803]  If that's what you need, yeah.
[00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:09.823]  Is this a trick question?
[00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:11.344]  Because I see you're with Infowars.
[00:02:12.244 --> 00:02:15.825]  To be honest with you, an increased police presence does not necessarily mean you're safer.
[00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:17.406]  It means you're more controlled.
[00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:22.027]  It's designed to watch over us and limit our ability to protect ourselves.
[00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:26.888]  They passed this new gun law saying you can't have more than 10 rounds in your magazine and so forth.
[00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:28.469]  They don't want you to conceal, carry out here.
[00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.990]  Does it make you feel safe to know that these people can't protect themselves with a firearm?
[00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:39.811]  Well, I think they can because there are a lot of cops, as I said, and they're controlling.
[00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:42.193]  I think everything is under control, you know?
[00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.155]  One round is enough, right?
[00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:45.196]  One round is enough.
[00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:46.898]  Okay, I feel safe already.
[00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:51.463]  Sir, look at the camera right there and tell people how safe you feel right now in the city of New York.
[00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:53.605]  With you, buddy, I feel damn safe.
[00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:54.225]  Yeah.
[00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:55.245]  Let's go Seahawks!
[00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:57.046]  Seahawks!
[00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:57.746]  Give me a Seahawk.
[00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:58.346]  Give me a Seahawk.
[00:02:58.386 --> 00:02:59.547]  Go Hawks!
[00:02:59.887 --> 00:03:00.647]  I'll tell you the truth.
[00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:04.508]  I can't wait till the Jake Ginge show up because that's what it's all about.
[00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:06.209]  It's about Superbowl.
[00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:07.589]  It's about Superbowl, baby.
[00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.350]  It's not about having constitutional rights.
[00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.810]  It's not about your fourth amendment.
[00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.710]  It's about the Superbowl.
[00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.350]  Yeah.
[00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.912]  Alright, you're not cool with Senator Dianne Feinstein who wants to take away everybody else's guns having a concealed carry.
[00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:18.852]  You're not cool with that?
[00:03:18.992 --> 00:03:19.653]  Absolutely not.
[00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:19.933]  No.
[00:03:20.373 --> 00:03:20.653]  I'm not.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.561]  Man, I don't know about this guy.
[00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.462]  I'm sorry bro, I'm about to jump you out.
[00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:31.664]  So, the fight for liberty continues, but with extremists like that, I don't know if we're going to make it.

[00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:35.826]  More reports at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:39.688]  So y'all think y'all got rights, right?
[00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:40.508]  Yeah, I got rights.
[00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:41.048]  I do got rights.
[00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:41.649]  I know I got rights.
[00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:42.889]  I'm out here with some extremists.
[00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.170]  These guys think they have rights.
[00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.891]  I mean, don't you want to feel safe in the United States of America?
[00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:48.132]  Not that they're about to molest me!
[00:03:55.973 --> 00:04:01.577]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:04:01.778 --> 00:04:08.983]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:12.366]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:14.288]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:19.114]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:21.957]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:27.904]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:31.525]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.

[00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:46.068]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:04:46.188 --> 00:04:48.168]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
