[00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:18.308]  Attorney General Eric Holder told a House Appropriations Subcommittee that his agency is looking into gun tracking bracelets to be mandatory for all gun owners.
[00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:32.012]  One of the technologies that the Department of Justice is looking at is a recent innovation that allows gun owners to only unlock a safe with a fingerprint scan and an RFID equipped bracelet.
[00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:40.096]  Others have even suggested that making GPS tracking and RFID chips mandatory for all registered firearms.
[00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:53.862]  Recently, Attorney General Eric Holder suggested that there be some kind of mandatory bracelet that gun owners wear that only the registered gun owner would have access to that gun because he was wearing a bracelet.
[00:00:53.902 --> 00:00:54.723]  What are your thoughts on that?
[00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:56.905]  I mean, I think that's good.
[00:00:56.966 --> 00:01:09.057]  I mean, especially if they're carrying it around and they have the bracelets on, then I guess people will be a little more comfortable knowing that this person has gone through the process in order to get the gun and it's extremely legal and things like that.
[00:01:09.077 --> 00:01:10.359]  That's genius.
[00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.001]  Whoever came up with that, that's good.
[00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:13.602]  I like that.
[00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:19.804]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:24.465]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:31.407]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:01:31.707 --> 00:01:33.168]  That sounds like a great idea.
[00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.310]  It would stop a lot of the violence, obviously, I guess.
[00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:49.119]  I like that idea a lot because I think that it would give people a lot more accountability to say, like, if you want to carry a concealed weapon, you need to be able to own that and have people know that you're carrying it, um, by, uh, by showing them that you're carrying one.
[00:01:49.239 --> 00:02:01.447]  That's absolutely ridiculous and infringes your rights in ways that, and I mean, who decided that safety was more important than my personal liberty and ability to defend my own safety rather than entrusted in them, where they're all the way in Washington making these policies.
[00:02:01.827 --> 00:02:01.947]  No.
[00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:02.067]  No.
[00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:02.127]  No.
[00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:03.048]  Old school ways.
[00:02:03.128 --> 00:02:04.729]  That's what's gonna make the streets better.
[00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:05.650]  Back in the 1980s.
[00:02:22.438 --> 00:02:23.499]  That's old school.
[00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.160]  Like an old-fashioned ass-whooping?
[00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:27.442]  Yes, an old-fashioned ass-whooping.
[00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:28.303]  I'm with you there.
[00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:40.774]  I believe once we allow the government to start to track these individuals, it is abridging our, you know, implied rights to privacy that we may have in our Constitution.
[00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:45.138]  However, I think there should be some sort of registration on every gun owner
[00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.541]  Guns are for recreational purposes and more than one person is going to be wanting to use it.
[00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.562]  You said it's a key thing right there.
[00:02:53.582 --> 00:02:55.322]  You said it's for recreational purposes.
[00:02:55.442 --> 00:03:03.565]  What about, and also for your safety and in case somebody breaks into your house, what about against a tyrannical government?
[00:03:06.502 --> 00:03:07.443]  It's in the Constitution.
[00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:11.887]  It is in the Constitution, but, you know, that was written 250 years ago.
[00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:14.630]  So you think it's a little outdated?
[00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.231]  I'd say it's a little outdated.
[00:03:16.371 --> 00:03:22.357]  Vice President Biden and I had a meeting with a group of technology people and talked about how
[00:03:22.697 --> 00:03:27.480]  So do you think Obama appointed the right man for the job as far as Attorney General?
[00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:45.904]  I think so.
[00:03:45.944 --> 00:03:48.325]  It sounds like he's doing... that's a good suggestion.
[00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:53.327]  He's at least thinking critically about the situation and trying to come up with other ideas to protect people's safety.
[00:03:53.407 --> 00:03:54.988]  Isn't he the fast and furious guy?
[00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:56.588]  That's the very same one.
[00:03:56.608 --> 00:04:06.532]  Isn't he the guy who did the pardon at the end of Bill Clinton's time on that guy that basically bought his own way out of criminality?
[00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:10.814]  So it doesn't really surprise you that it's his brain behind all this?
[00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:12.255]  Not one bit.
[00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:13.495]  That's genius.
[00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:14.716]  Whoever came up with that...
[00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.076]  I like that.
