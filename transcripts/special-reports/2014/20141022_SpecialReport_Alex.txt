[00:00:05.782 --> 00:00:10.104]  With huge stories this year about immigration and currently Ebola, U.S.
[00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:22.129]  gun control is still a hot topic in the news, with our soon-to-be former Attorney General Eric Holder saying that the Obama administration's lack of passing more stringent gun laws is something that weighs heavily on his mind.
[00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:35.255]  But for all the background checks and RFID guns that the Attorney General suggested for American citizens, he didn't implement any of these measures when the Justice Department under his reign walked guns into the hands of Mexican drug cartels.
[00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:39.570]  Listen to what Holder told a Judiciary Committee hearing on May 3rd this year.
[00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.637]  I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks.
[00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:54.039]  Yet internal Justice Department documents show that at least 10 months before that hearing, Holder began receiving frequent memos discussing Fast and Furious.
[00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.622]  They came from the head of the National Drug Intelligence Center and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Brewer.
[00:01:00.142 --> 00:01:07.926]  And President Obama speaking in Mexico said that the reason that Mexico had such high gun violence was because of the United States Second Amendment.
[00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:09.067]  I also...
[00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:10.737]  We're good to go.
[00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:22.982]  The southbound flow of illegal guns and cash that help to fuel violence.
[00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:32.525]  But while this administration is busy trying to brainwash the way we think about guns... It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:39.528]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:01:39.768 --> 00:01:42.068]  There are now reports that a drop from a U.S.
[00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:46.870]  airship containing arms and munitions has been found in ISIS-held territory.
[00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:57.911]  An ISIS-associated YouTube account posted a new video online entitled, Weapons and Munitions Dropped by American Planes into Areas Controlled by the Islamic State in Kobani.
[00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:21.920]  And I don't speak the native tongue, but it's my understanding that the people in the video are saying that the weapons, the guns, the grenades were dropped by U.S.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.528]  forces, which is to say for all our rhetoric in the States about universal background checks and gun control, we'll leave weapons in the field for anybody who gets there first.

[00:03:00.032 --> 00:03:03.796]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
