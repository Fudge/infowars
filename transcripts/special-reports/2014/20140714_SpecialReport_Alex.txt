[00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:06.338]  We're good.
[00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:16.118]  I'm standing in front of the Paramount Theater here in Austin, Texas, where His Highness President Barack Obama is headlining.
[00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:24.163]  Now, in response to his critics who wondered why he wasn't at the border while he's in Texas, he said a visit to the border would be nothing more than theater.
[00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:34.250]  And, of course, the irony is not lost on the fact that his name is on the marquee at the Paramount Theater as he's here to address his adoring fans.
[00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.593]  Well, we're gonna go check with some of these people, some of whom have waited since midnight
[00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:41.054]  Trying to get tickets to see the big show.
[00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:47.159]  Are you super pumped to be in the presence of the Lord and Savior Obama?
[00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.879]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.161]  You know, it's not every day you see the President.
[00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:53.663]  Yes, I am, but I'm hoping to get them in too.
[00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:54.864]  I really want her to go.
[00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:56.325]  I think she'll appreciate it.
[00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.187]  No, I think it's more about just seeing the President.
[00:00:59.328 --> 00:01:00.668]  I've never seen a President before.
[00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.312]  How do you feel knowing that you might still not make it past the rope?
[00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:08.558]  Well, if that happens, we would not be very happy.
[00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:12.061]  It would be a waste of time, but at least it's worth watching.
[00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:14.822]  We heard people actually stayed overnight.
[00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:15.923]  Were they?
[00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:16.343]  Overnight.
[00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:16.824]  Yeah, they did.
[00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:17.564]  What about you guys?
[00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:18.845]  We did that, actually.
[00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:19.625]  You were there?
[00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:20.446]  What time did you get there?
[00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:21.447]  Midnight?
[00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:22.307]  Yeah, around that.
[00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:25.349]  Midnight the night before, so they could start doling out tickets at 8.30.
[00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:29.452]  So, you guys are visiting from Europe?
[00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:30.332]  Exactly.
[00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:31.213]  From Switzerland.
[00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.731]  So this is super exciting for you to go see the President of the United States of America?
[00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:36.231]  Indeed, yes.
[00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:37.212]  Indeed.
[00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:38.072]  Kinda.
[00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:41.373]  I gotta warn you, I work at Fox around the corner.
[00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:41.953]  Okay.
[00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:51.456]  Well, so if you had one shot to ask the President anything, let's just say he goes all maverick-y and rogue and lets people ask him a question, what would be your one question?
[00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:56.217]  Uh, I'd like to do something about student loan debt.
[00:01:56.877 --> 00:01:59.518]  I would probably just go mute and not be able to talk.
[00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:02.416]  Is he going for a third term?
[00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:05.138]  I know he can't, but... Would you like him to?
[00:02:05.178 --> 00:02:05.738]  Would you vote for him?
[00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.138]  Yes, I would.
[00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:06.758]  Yes, I would.
[00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.679]  I would vote for him.
[00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.861]  It'd be a toss between Clinton and Obama.
[00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:16.524]  I think I would be asking him about what he plans to do for the next two years of his presidency.
[00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:20.246]  How is he going to handle the issues that we're seeing with the gridlock?
[00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:23.988]  He's doing the best he can, obviously, but there has to be a breaking point.
[00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:26.970]  Why are you continuing the drone rally?
[00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.071]  Wow, good question!
[00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:31.014]  I'd say, hey can we hang out later?
[00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:33.955]  Do you want to hang out with the president later?
[00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:34.715]  Yes.
[00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:38.356]  How long have you been staying in Hawaii?
[00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:39.156]  Probably.
[00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:40.437]  How long?
[00:02:40.457 --> 00:02:42.717]  Are you into Hawaii?
[00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:43.417]  Yeah.
[00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:50.519]  Do you think it's weird that people like hail the president as sort of a kingly figure?
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.061]  It is something you have to get used to.
[00:02:54.101 --> 00:03:01.945]  I mean, I can understand it if he's such an important person for the state, but if you come from a system where it isn't that way, it takes getting used to.
[00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:08.028]  We have people protesting the fact that he is here and not other places.
[00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:12.210]  What do you guys think about him being here and maybe there's some other things going on?
[00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.393]  There are always places that want the president to be there that require leadership, but
[00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:22.689]  He's gotta do the rounds.
[00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.471]  It's his country.
[00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:26.175]  He's gotta see all the parts of it.
[00:03:26.616 --> 00:03:28.419]  Well, it's our country.
[00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.070]  Were you surprised with what he said last night about the meeting between him and Perry and where he stands on what's happening at the border?
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.641]  Uh, yeah.
[00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:38.443]  You know, it sounds like it's politics.
[00:03:38.463 --> 00:03:41.165]  They're using it as a political wedge issue.
[00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:47.071]  You know, he could overturn the policy and start doing something about it now.
[00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:48.392]  He doesn't have to wait for Congress.
[00:03:48.632 --> 00:03:51.795]  This is not Obama saying, hey, Mexicans, come over the border.
[00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:57.801]  He is saying we are a country that allows people to come and request asylum.
[00:03:58.143 --> 00:04:00.945]  He really should talk about immigration.
[00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:04.107]  There's a lot of people from Latin America waiting for something.
[00:04:04.847 --> 00:04:09.970]  And I think there was a lot of time that people is really waiting for someone.
[00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.273]  It's not about being somewhere, it's about taking the right actions and knowing what's going on.
[00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:17.755]  Do you think that he's taking the right actions?
[00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:21.477]  I'm not really up to date on what he's done on the border, so...
[00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:42.124]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:44.445]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:47.246]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:51.428]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:04:51.728 --> 00:04:54.889]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:04:54.909 --> 00:05:02.172]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:06.476]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:08.317]  We are the true media.
[00:05:08.478 --> 00:05:11.080]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.843]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
