[00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:12.766]  Alex Jones here to share some very exciting information with you.
[00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:19.807]  Going back to when I first got on air back in 1995, I was somewhat of a sports enthusiast.
[00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:27.929]  I ran six miles every two days, lift weights, but I pigged out, ate as much rich food as I wanted, drank beer, you name it.
[00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.851]  And so when I got fully committed to the Liberty Movement and started working 18 hours a day launching what has become InfoWars, I quit working out.
[00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:43.715]  In fact, I quit doing exercise pretty much of any type, other than occasionally going for hikes.
[00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:45.516]  And I went from 180 pounds to 275 pounds.
[00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:48.958]  And I'll tell you, the last 19 years have gone by in a flash.
[00:00:55.126 --> 00:01:03.929]  I looked up and 15 years had gone by and I'd stopped exercising and I had almost 100 pounds of extra weight hanging on my body.
[00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.972]  Then I started changing my diet some, I started exercising, swimming, lifting weights, but the weight wasn't coming off.
[00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:26.379]  Then, in the last two years, doing the same amount of exercise and taking the proper vitamins and minerals and the products that you'll find at places like Infowarshealth.com, I lost more than 30 pounds.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.864]  But still, I couldn't get that last weight off and I'm still working on it.
[00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:31.565]  I think?
[00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:57.884]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff!
[00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:17.385]  We don't sell bull.
[00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:18.226]  What'd it do for you?
[00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:22.010]  Oh man, I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.812]  No lazy legs, ready to go.
[00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:27.676]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:30.418]  The survival shield and then the male vitality.
[00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:35.363]  I'm telling you, for a 50-year-old guy, I am so much leaner now and so much healthier.
[00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:37.505]  I have so much more zest for life.
[00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:46.096]  You know, this is the result that you get from giving your body the things that it needs to activate its own systems.
[00:02:46.256 --> 00:02:47.598]  We can turn this around.
[00:02:47.638 --> 00:02:49.140]  We don't need Obamacare.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.307]  We need to start healing people because we are in a war.
[00:02:54.787 --> 00:02:58.768]  With InfoWarsLife, we're looking at a classic win-win scenario.
