[00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:20.750]  Well, it's not coming out until March 4th, 2016.
[00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:23.713]  Prometheus 2.
[00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:35.602]  But just like we gave you the first sneak peek before Prometheus 1 came out, we're set to do it here again today at InfoWars.com.
[00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:41.907]  Prometheus itself is just a backdrop to project a larger discussion onto
[00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:43.529]  We're good to go.
[00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:07.787]  Without giving away too much on what is going to be in Prometheus 2.
[00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:11.689]  So, first look at Prometheus 2 here today.
[00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:30.018]  Now, I want to be clear, this breakdown is not an assault on Christianity, which is my faith, but my faith is not the Christianity promoted by the mainline preachers, many of them themselves dogmatically controlled by their administrations and state-run systems to keep the public unaware of what the elite themselves believe.
[00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:32.421]  Which is not necessarily what I believe.
[00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:39.130]  But it's important to understand the governing system of the establishment if we hope to beat them.
[00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.458]  Now the elite themselves see themselves becoming the master engineers.
[00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:46.900]  Ray Kurzweil that heads up Google's
[00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:55.548]  A future technology development has said he doesn't believe in God yet, but that he will soon become God, and that those of us that don't accept this will be stepped on.
[00:01:55.928 --> 00:02:02.293]  They're saying it's the end of humanity, they've decided we're garbage, and that they're gonna merge with the machines and become these God-like creatures.
[00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:03.715]  They're now playing the part.
[00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:14.898]  They see Asgard preparing for a new overwrite, not by water, not by fire, but by genetic engineering, aka the Prometheus model.
[00:02:15.378 --> 00:02:17.938]  And then there's also the point of AI technology.
[00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:22.959]  Will it end up being dominant over humans that have been discarded?
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.201]  Or will it be the super genetic engineering family that becomes dominant?
[00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:33.262]  Now, there are a lot of good things in the fire of Prometheus.
[00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:35.944]  That technology, genetic engineering, could help us.
[00:02:36.464 --> 00:02:39.387]  With frogs and other amphibians, we could grow back limbs.
[00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:40.849]  We could grow back eyes.
[00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.673]  We could have brain chips that help us live longer, and not have Parkinson's.
[00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:51.019]  A lot of that already exists, and DARPA's acting like they just now rolled it out.
[00:02:51.559 --> 00:03:12.836]  The larger problem is there are thousands of companies and tens of thousands of experiments going on with human embryonic cloning for at least 30 years that was kept secret until a few years ago, splicing humans with animals, really nightmare things that eclipse anything you see in Hollywood, in any film for that matter, not just Prometheus.
[00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:14.617]  Here's a few articles.
[00:03:14.977 --> 00:03:17.539]  Growing Human Organs Inside Pigs in Japan.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.661]  Glowing in the dark, monkeys that are part jellyfish you can buy in Hong Kong bazaars.
[00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:27.002]  Artificial human ears grown in labs.
[00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:45.646]  I mean there are literally thousands of examples of this going on and families already paying for designer babies that have certain color eyes or will be taller than the parents even though they admit they don't understand DNA and that when you randomly change one piece of DNA
[00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:59.010]  It then releases all these other thousands of combinations and entire separate genomes of humans and other species not known on this planet that are in our genetics.
[00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.030]  And that is in the New York Times.
[00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.192]  I remember interviewing people 20 years ago, almost 20 years ago, on this subject of epigenetics.
[00:04:07.216 --> 00:04:15.323]  That the fact is we're like a book with chapters as we grow and the environment will influence how we manifest the genes that are already there.
[00:04:15.563 --> 00:04:19.467]  They're telling you that you get cancer and cancer is going up because you have bad genes.
[00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:24.791]  No, the environment is manifesting things that are triggering our genes to do that.
[00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.714]  Here's an article in the New York Times, DNA double-take.
[00:04:28.314 --> 00:04:33.715]  And the way I had this described to me 15 years ago by a top genetic engineer I was interviewing was, it's like taking a picture of a tiger.
[00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:38.937]  That was the gene sequencing at Cold Springs Harbor by IBM that happened by 2000.
[00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:41.017]  They didn't have a tiger.
[00:04:41.478 --> 00:04:42.598]  They didn't know a tiger.
[00:04:42.738 --> 00:04:44.298]  They didn't have it with them.
[00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:46.099]  It couldn't reproduce.
[00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.840]  They had a photo of a tiger and were claiming that they had a tiger.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.621]  But now we know it's bigger than that.
[00:04:54.622 --> 00:05:13.867]  And that's why so many atheists that are genetic engineers now believe in God or aliens or the fact that humans were seeded here because there's no way the so-called evolution theory... See, the mainline Christians that follow dogma put out to make Christians look bad, they're there to discredit Christianity and make it look unscientific.
[00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.828]  The truth is everything in it affirms it.
[00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:25.472]  And then you've got the other dogma religious people that only believe in the official version of evolution, when we know it comes in big jumps instantly, pretty much.
[00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:27.414]  And that's what this says.
[00:05:27.474 --> 00:05:38.960]  It says, there's no way humans were basically from this planet, and there's no way, and we've got all this DNA that isn't even, you know, it's other humans, but other things, and it's freaking them out.
[00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.641]  Well, it should freak them out.
[00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:43.443]  Ten ways science is using human-animal hybrids.
[00:05:43.483 --> 00:05:44.484]  Again, the chimeras.
[00:05:45.947 --> 00:05:48.168]  The mouse with the ear was 30 years ago, folks.
[00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:50.250]  They're just now announcing this to the public.
[00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.972]  FDA considering three-parent embryos.
[00:05:53.432 --> 00:05:54.613]  Will that even be a human?
[00:05:54.973 --> 00:06:09.143]  This lets the master engineers piggyback and Trojan horse into this so-called humanoid whatever they want, just like they Trojan horse stuff into your dishwasher that spies on you with smart meters and your cell phone or your new digital wristwatch.
[00:06:09.863 --> 00:06:13.966]  It's not that technology's bad, it's that the people running it are bad.
[00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:17.808]  FDA panel debates technique that would create, again, three parents.
[00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:20.029]  Genetically modified babies.
[00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.730]  New York Times.
[00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.892]  Because I talk about spider goats 15, 20 years ago.
[00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:30.296]  People thought I was lying, even though I had the CEO on of part spider, part goat creatures to create body armor.
[00:06:31.877 --> 00:06:32.997]  Again, here's Time Magazine.
[00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:34.138]  Prometheus 101.
[00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:37.180]  The science behind Ridley Scott's vision of aliens.
[00:06:39.414 --> 00:06:40.355]  Populating Earth.
[00:06:40.455 --> 00:06:41.695]  It's not such a crazy idea.
[00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:45.298]  Research has long supported the theory that life originated elsewhere.
[00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:47.339]  Again, they're telling you their religion here.
[00:06:48.328 --> 00:06:48.668]  Okay?
[00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:51.310]  Evolution is discredited.
[00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.291]  It's not the way things happen.
[00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:59.654]  Cars evolve, culture evolves, there is definitely change in species, change in genetic lines.
[00:06:59.714 --> 00:07:06.577]  I'm not saying some of it doesn't happen, but it's a very small part of the larger issue here that we're dealing with.
[00:07:07.658 --> 00:07:09.539]  Ridley Scott's Prometheus rest
[00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:13.060]  On real astronomy, another mainline headline.
[00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:16.964]  Seeding life through the universe, another article.
[00:07:17.444 --> 00:07:24.110]  Humans did not come from Earth, and sunburn, bad backs, and pain during labor prove it, expert claims.
[00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:25.351]  Daily Mail.
[00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:30.296]  Alien poll finds half of Americans think extraterrestrial life exists.
[00:07:31.378 --> 00:07:36.222]  All these different Earth-like planets that are being found with the super telescopes they've got now.
[00:07:36.463 --> 00:07:42.368]  Here's Wall Street Journal about an Earth-sized planet with water could exist, could be discovered.
[00:07:43.148 --> 00:07:45.651]  On and on and on.
[00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:48.013]  Stephen Hawking says it obviously exists.
[00:07:48.573 --> 00:07:50.554]  And that aliens will probably destroy us.
[00:07:51.455 --> 00:07:54.657]  And I have been able to talk to folks that have seen a script out in Hollywood.
[00:07:54.918 --> 00:07:55.958]  It's all very secretive.
[00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:58.180]  But we do know the basic line of it.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.083]  And it's about a human journey of humans discovering where we came from.
[00:08:03.344 --> 00:08:08.807]  But does that mean it's even true from the perspective that Hollywood is selling in this?
[00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:15.050]  The point is, this is a larger window into a discussion of where we came from.
[00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:37.740]  And when you have that discussion, the reason I think that discussion is a good discussion, it will then lead people not just into fables and not just into conjecture, but to what humans are building and creating now that gives us a window into the DNA we have and what may have been in the past in other creations that the Bible clearly speaks of.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.442]  Before the allegory of Adam and Eve.
[00:08:41.882 --> 00:09:05.897]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, we need to continue to brainstorm on these subjects and to talk about it, and then to realize this discussion allows us to transcend the social engineers who are trying to become demigods, who openly believe that we are their cattle to be experimented on and manipulated in their quest to become omnipotent gods.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:15.707]  When clearly they are the most selfish, greedy, anti-human, anti-God type individuals I could ever imagine.
[00:09:16.187 --> 00:09:27.176]  These people follow the archetype of the devil, or the destroyer, or those that seek to suppress human enlightenment and human empowerment.
[00:09:27.896 --> 00:09:30.778]  So that is your sneak peek at Prometheus 2.
[00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.640]  You're living it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:39.144]  This is what's fantastic is life on this planet, not this film that's coming up.
[00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:50.731]  But if we can hijack the discussion of it and use it to direct people out of the Hollywood system into the larger universe, it certainly has borne some positive fruit.
[00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:54.014]  And that's what we attempt to do here at InfoWars.com.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:22.689]  One of the most anticipated sci-fi films in recent memory, InfoWars.com research analysis shows, Prometheus is not just a film, but a revelation of the method, revealing the deepest secrets of the Illuminati mystery religion.
[00:10:26.454 --> 00:10:42.400]  I do have a lot of contacts in the media as viewers and listeners know, and I have been able to secure a copy of an early script and it follows very closely from the trailer I've seen and other leaks.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.122]  I'm not going to give the entire film away here, but in synopsis,
[00:10:48.584 --> 00:11:05.193]  This is a film about the origins of humankind with a super race of near-immortal genetic engineers who are contemplating a genetic overwrite or rewrite of the planet Earth.
[00:11:05.653 --> 00:11:12.837]  When meddling humans stumble in to the magician's laboratory, they are punished for their trespass.
[00:11:13.037 --> 00:11:13.998]  It was so wrong.
[00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:29.965]  The so-called space jockey is the advanced species that have engineered humans back on Earth and produced the bio-weapon that we know of as the classical alien that burst out of your chest after feeding on the food in your intestines.
[00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:39.154]  The reason we're taking time out to examine Prometheus is because its storyline, its plot, mirrors that of many ancient societies.
[00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:45.344]  And the ideas presented in Prometheus are at the core of Western secret societies.
[00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:49.530]  These are ancient civilizations that were separated by centuries.
[00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.236]  And yet, this same pictogram was discovered in every one of them.
[00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:54.698]  Please tell me you can read that.
[00:11:56.849 --> 00:12:04.772]  Across the world, we see evidence of early civilizations' obsession with what they believed were off-world influences.
[00:12:05.113 --> 00:12:16.738]  From the Nazca Lines in South America to the pyramids of Egypt, we see artifacts, testament to early man's obsession with off-world manipulators.
[00:12:17.658 --> 00:12:23.040]  Every ancient culture believed they were communicating with men from the sky.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:34.724]  Ezekiel with spinning wheels of fire landing and creatures with blue space helmets approaching Ezekiel and giving him a drug to take and then he has wild hallucinations.
[00:12:35.424 --> 00:12:44.067]  One could say that Prometheus is simply art imitating life and putting a 21st century spin on the beliefs of the Dogon tribe in Africa.
[00:12:44.787 --> 00:12:46.708]  and the Aztecs of Mesoamerica.
[00:12:47.408 --> 00:13:00.693]  Eric Von Donaghan, more than any other living person, has popularized the idea of chariots of the gods, and that our planet has been visited and manipulated by off-world creatures for thousands of years.
[00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:09.296]  But the systems that he popularized were regurgitated whole cloth from ideas developed by the ruling class of this planet.
[00:13:09.776 --> 00:13:10.457]  And I want to be clear,
[00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:21.714]  Every major globalist we look at, going back more than 160 years, is completely and totally obsessed with the idea
[00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:28.262]  That off-world aliens are controlling this planet and giving them hidden knowledge.
[00:13:28.802 --> 00:13:30.963]  By the 1870s, T.H.
[00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:36.126]  Huxley Group and their X-Club was dominating the Royal Society in England.
[00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:45.331]  The dominant theory within the X-Club was that humans had been seeded here, along with most other lifeforms, by advanced beings from space.
[00:13:46.212 --> 00:13:49.894]  From the inception of Darwin's theory on the origin of species,
[00:13:50.962 --> 00:13:56.445]  Evolutionary scientists never believed for a minute that life simply started on its own.
[00:13:56.825 --> 00:14:08.272]  That evolution is not some random, slow system developing by chance, but is actually directed by off-world seeders, terra-farmers, creators of worlds.
[00:14:09.012 --> 00:14:19.158]  Even the discoverer of DNA, Francis Crick, promotes the idea that life was seeded on this planet, in what he calls directed panspermia.
[00:14:19.978 --> 00:14:22.840]  It is part of the larger myth of transhumanism.
[00:14:23.661 --> 00:14:33.528]  Huxley, Darwin, Wedgwood, the Galtans, they all interbred in an attempt to create this transcendent Superman.
[00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:39.213]  The governing class of this globe believes that they are
[00:14:41.016 --> 00:14:48.165]  Channeling advanced technological systems given to them by ancient alien species.
[00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:54.913]  And the science fiction of the last 150 years, whether it's Jules Verne or H.G.
[00:14:55.774 --> 00:14:57.436]  Wells or those that came before them,
[00:14:58.257 --> 00:15:00.118]  We can create cybernetic individuals.
[00:15:29.158 --> 00:15:30.059]  Are the gods now?
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:38.369]  Blurring the lines between fiction and reality, we see a futuristic presentation of the technology conference TED.
[00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:43.234]  The keynote speaker is the founder of the Weyland Corporation, Mr. Weyland.
[00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:46.718]  There he describes Prometheus stealing fire from the gods.
[00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:48.507]  From the titan, Prometheus.
[00:15:49.327 --> 00:15:51.468]  Our first true piece of technology.
[00:15:51.648 --> 00:15:52.048]  Fire.
[00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:58.791]  The transference of fire, or the first technology to man, is only the beginning of his transgressions.
[00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:07.975]  Prometheus is a titan, and the creator of mankind, who attempts to elevate humans to the level of gods, and is punished.
[00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:14.338]  The Illuminati believe they have stolen the fire of true genius from the gods.
[00:16:14.994 --> 00:16:17.457]  Biotech, nanotech, fusion.
[00:16:17.697 --> 00:16:24.845]  As man attempts to become godlike, we release potential forces that can and probably will destroy us.
[00:16:25.406 --> 00:16:27.228]  I want to say this in summation.
[00:16:28.544 --> 00:16:34.688]  We're not facing off-world genetic engineers that the elite believes created this planet, whether that's true or not.
[00:16:35.148 --> 00:16:50.237]  We're facing the global technocrats that are splicing every plant and animal and insect you can imagine together, that are creating chimeras with hundreds of species within them, giving rise to superviruses and bacterial mutations.
[00:16:51.298 --> 00:16:59.962]  We are already seeing within three generations in rodents total sterilization and massive deformities in these animals.
[00:17:00.862 --> 00:17:10.127]  And we have proven from the Rockefeller Foundation documents and other reports that this is part of a long-term program to wreck the general public's DNA.
[00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:16.510]  This is the global elite who have fantasized about off-world genetic engineers creating them
[00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:24.454]  We're actually in a 160 year plus program developing the sciences and technologies to put this into place.
[00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:31.458]  Whatever you say about the Illuminati, they have got patience and they have had incredible vision.
[00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:37.722]  But I believe humanity needs to hear the truth and understand this is being carried out against us all.
[00:17:38.562 --> 00:17:43.287]  Because we have a choice to stand up now, but only a short window, and say no.
[00:17:43.928 --> 00:17:45.149]  I know the plot of the film.
[00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.691]  I know how it ends.
