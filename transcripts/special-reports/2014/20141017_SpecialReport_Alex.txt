[00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:13.069]  This is Jakari Jackson here to address the political correctness in the United States of America.
[00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.670]  Because you see, you can talk about President Kennedy being a playboy.
[00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.591]  You can talk about Nixon being a crook.
[00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:20.111]  You can talk about Bush being dumb.
[00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.492]  You can talk about Bill Clinton's sexual appetites.
[00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:26.454]  But if you dare criticize President Barack Obama, well you know what they call you.
[00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:27.534]  That's why we have this.
[00:00:27.914 --> 00:00:29.295]  Hashtag Ebola.
[00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:30.275]  Let's do this thing.
[00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:38.128]  Well, this outbreak, we know that it's bigger because it got into urban areas.
[00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:39.229]  We know that.
[00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.851]  You know, warming temperatures, stuff like that.
[00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:43.732]  Warming temperatures spread Ebola.
[00:00:44.532 --> 00:00:45.213]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.673]  Well, it's not going to live in the Arctic, is it?
[00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:48.555]  The Hashtag Ebola Contest.
[00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:54.018]  The $5,000 grand prize for displaying your poster in legal and lawful areas.
[00:00:56.837 --> 00:00:58.659]  Let's talk about the global war.
[00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.785]  You think it's a conspiracy, like, that somehow there's money to be reaped from, uh... Carbon taxes?
[00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:04.045]  Yes.
[00:01:06.088 --> 00:01:08.891]  And this probably isn't the most legal and lawful area.
[00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:14.478]  So, with what you heard about Ebola, how do you think about the response from the CDC, the President, Governor Rick Perry?
[00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:16.757]  I think the response is terrible.
[00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:20.779]  I mean, I think our borders should have been closed immediately when the outbreak happened.
[00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:26.802]  And I think letting these people travel after they've been exposed and not having proper quarantines is terrible.
[00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:30.384]  Make sure you post a video on YouTube of yourself hanging the poster.
[00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:31.845]  Don't just take a picture of it.
[00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.211]  I'm from Togo, West Africa.
[00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:34.012]  I don't believe Ebola.
[00:01:34.332 --> 00:01:35.414]  You don't believe in Ebola?
[00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:36.074]  No, I don't.
[00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:36.535]  This is crazy.
[00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:37.716]  Prove it to you right now.
[00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:39.798]  Please prove to me that Ebola is not real.
[00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.760]  With something in your purse, you're going to prove to me it's not real?
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.981]  Yes.
[00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:42.601]  Okay.
[00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.283]  Okay, and my boyfriend, he has army?
[00:01:44.483 --> 00:01:44.684]  Yes.
[00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:45.905]  Where Ebola is?
[00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:48.728]  But, I mean, is this true that Ebola is not real?
[00:01:49.148 --> 00:01:49.929]  I don't believe it.
[00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:50.910]  I don't believe Ebola is not real.
[00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.011]  So what's killing these people, then?
[00:01:52.392 --> 00:01:53.213]  We're killing people.
[00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:54.134]  Drug can kill you.
[00:01:54.522 --> 00:02:05.190]  Make sure you follow the full contest rules which include but are not limited to placing hashtag Ebola on your poster also InfoWars.com and it doesn't hurt to have tyranny is the disease.
[00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.372]  Let's talk about what I discussed with the young lady here.
[00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:12.955]  I was asking her, well she informed us that Ebola isn't real.
[00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:13.876]  You witnessed this as well?
[00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:16.358]  Yes, I believe Ebola is real.

[00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:30.929]  You know, I know Alex Jones, that shirt is funny.
[00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.692]  I mean, the Ebola shirt, but yeah.
[00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:51.569]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:02:52.029 --> 00:03:01.756]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:05.819]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
