[00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:11.690]  Imagine this scenario.
[00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.431]  It's about 5.30 in the morning and you hear the rustling of a window.
[00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:19.954]  Maybe you pick up a firearm and you walk through your dark house to investigate.
[00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:21.815]  You turn the corner and what do you find?
[00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.316]  Multiple armed men climbing in through said window.
[00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:28.438]  You open fire on the men, hitting three, killing one.
[00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:36.382]  And then you find out that despite these criminal tactics, these are in fact police officers and now you, the homeowner, are facing a murder charge.
[00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:39.583]  Such is the case of Marvin Guy of Texas.
[00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:41.645]  Police entered the home looking for drugs.
[00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:45.587]  They did find drug paraphernalia, but not the drugs that they were looking for.
[00:00:46.827 --> 00:00:49.209]  What about the case of Ryan Frederick of Virginia?
[00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:56.052]  A police informant had burglarized his home, and then went and told law enforcement that he had witnessed a growing operation of marijuana.
[00:00:56.493 --> 00:01:03.877]  The police raided the home, but Frederick, logically thinking that the burglar had returned, opened fire on a man he saw kicking in his front door.
[00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:10.080]  It happened to be a police officer, and now Frederick is facing 10 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.723]  The police did recover some marijuana, but it turns out that Frederick isn't exactly the Rick Ross or Scarface of Mary Jane.
[00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:23.246]  But common sense does sometimes prevail, such as in the case of Henry Goldrich of Texas
[00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:34.520]  Texas sheriffs busted into his house with a no-knock raid at the end of 2013, but Godrej, thinking that logically a burglar was coming into his home, opened fire on the sheriffs, killing one of them.
[00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:40.308]  The murder charge was eventually dropped, but Godrej still had to contend with drug and weapons allegations.
[00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:45.513]  The shock and awe tactic of the no-knock raid is self-defeating in my personal opinion.
[00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:53.079]  Why can't we go back to the old days where an officer would come knock on the door at a decent hour, maybe another officer out back in case the suspect took off.
[00:01:53.419 --> 00:02:03.427]  Instead of riding around in these black war wagons giving the police a false sense of security, they find out the hard way that all it takes is a few well-placed shots to evade all that body armor.

[00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:23.926]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:26.247]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:02:26.427 --> 00:02:29.069]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.211]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:02:33.532 --> 00:02:36.694]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:43.978]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:55.222]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:02:55.402 --> 00:02:56.783]  We are the resistance.
[00:02:57.063 --> 00:02:58.423]  You are the resistance.
[00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:00.344]  You are the info war.
[00:03:00.524 --> 00:03:04.646]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:03:04.826 --> 00:03:06.467]  We are the true media.
[00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:09.228]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:12.889]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
