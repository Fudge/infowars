[00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:10.094]  Hey guys, this is Rob Doo with Infowars.com.
[00:00:10.134 --> 00:00:20.566]  I have some breaking news on the Florida state shooter who people now know as Myron May is the one that police shot dead.
[00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:25.452]  And a lot of people that knew the guy are saying, well, they're really surprised.
[00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:26.953]  They never expected him to do this.
[00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:31.355]  And there's an article out of the Panama City News Herald.
[00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:41.638]  They say he had ADHD and took medication to control the symptoms, which is something we've seen a lot in these shooter scenarios where they're on psychotropic drugs of one kind or another.
[00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:43.199]  It could be antidepressants.
[00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.860]  It's ADHD medication in a lot of cases.
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:56.583]  And then they're saying his mental health had deteriorated over the course of several weeks, and over the past several days the deterioration had been especially rapid, and he went days without sleeping.
[00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:08.587]  And I don't know if any of you know, some of these ADHD medications are like amphetamines, and they could keep you up all night, and maybe it's really sad, especially for the people, the victims who were there.
[00:01:09.388 --> 00:01:14.350]  But I do want to point out that it was somebody carrying a firearm that was able to stop this individual.
[00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.293]  He wasn't just able to go on and continue his rampage.
[00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:21.975]  It's really sad when these things happen, but
[00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:34.386]  What's even sadder is when you find out that most of these active shooters are on, they either have a history of mental problems or they're on some sort of medication treating a mental problem.
[00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:36.648]  And is that something that triggers it?
[00:01:36.988 --> 00:01:37.309]  I don't know.
[00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.910]  They never want to do those studies.
[00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.673]  Everybody wants to come out and blame the gun as soon as stuff like this happens.
[00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:44.194]  We put out an article
[00:01:45.543 --> 00:01:49.524]  Back in January 10, 2013, what are mass suicide pills?
[00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:56.026]  Mass murder suicide pills, which Alex Jones kind of coined that term when he was on the Piers Morgan Show.
[00:01:56.586 --> 00:02:09.629]  Of the top 10 prescription drugs linked to violence towards others, a 2010 study based on FDA adverse reaction showed that 5 were antidepressants and 2 were for treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.
[00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.969]  This is what happens.
[00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:14.310]  This is the result of a culture over-prescribing medication.
[00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.533]  And this mentally unstable guy at some point decided he had to go out and shoot a bunch of people.
[00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:25.894]  It's really sad what happened to the victims.
[00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:30.255]  It could have been worse.
[00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:35.837]  But in this article they list a bunch of people.
[00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:37.292]  I don't know.
[00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:58.408]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:13.977]  Don't blame the gun.
[00:03:13.997 --> 00:03:15.378]  The gun didn't do it.
[00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:16.118]  The gun is a tool.

[00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:19.334]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:21.675]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.457]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:04:24.517 --> 00:04:28.620]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.103]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:39.388]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:50.594]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:52.195]  We are the resistance.
[00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:53.835]  You are the resistance.
[00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:55.756]  You are the info war.
[00:04:55.936 --> 00:05:00.039]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:01.880]  We are the true media.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.641]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:08.385]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
