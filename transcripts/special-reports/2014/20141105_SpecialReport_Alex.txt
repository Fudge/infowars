[00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:14.597]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:16.098]  You didn't get there on your own.
[00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:20.660]  I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.761]  There are a lot of smart people out there.
[00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:27.463]  Never leave till tomorrow, which you can do today.
[00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:28.863]  Benjamin Franklin.
[00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:31.384]  It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.
[00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:32.405]  Let me tell you something.
[00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:34.746]  There are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.
[00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:44.700]  There is no substitute for hard work, Thomas Alva Edison.
[00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:50.604]  If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.
[00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.646]  There was a great teacher somewhere in your life.
[00:00:55.588 --> 00:01:02.993]  Most pilots learn when they pin on their wings and go out and get in a fighter, especially that one thing you don't do.
[00:01:03.473 --> 00:01:06.775]  You don't believe anything anybody tells you about an airplane.
[00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:07.796]  Chuck Yeager.
[00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:09.297]  Somebody helped to create
[00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:14.531]  This unbelievable American system that we had that allowed you to thrive.
[00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:20.134]  Democracy is a pathetic belief in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance.
[00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:20.814]  H.L.
[00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:21.194]  Meekin.
[00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:23.976]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:01:24.997 --> 00:01:26.698]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:01:27.538 --> 00:01:32.861]  Nothing strengthens the judgment and quickens the conscience like individual responsibility.
[00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:35.102]  Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
[00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:39.065]  Don't let anybody tell you that, you know,
[00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.976]  It's corporations and businesses that create jobs.
[00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:48.700]  You know, that old theory, trickle-down economics.
[00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:52.442]  That has been tried.
[00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:54.243]  That has failed.
[00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:57.286]  The Internet didn't get invented on its own.
[00:01:57.786 --> 00:02:00.748]  I took the initiative in creating the Internet.
[00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:06.052]  I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives.
[00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:09.214]  There's some things, just like fighting fires, we don't do on our own.
[00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:13.575]  I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service.
[00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:17.238]  That'd be a hard way to organize fighting fires.
[00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.503]  So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there's some things we do better together.
[00:02:24.763 --> 00:02:36.531]  The basic philosophy between the so-called extreme left people and communists and socialists and the so-called philosophy on the right of the fascists and the Nazis was really the same.
[00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.531]  How can this be?
[00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.432]  They're supposed to be opposites of each other.
[00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:49.380]  Then I began to realize that there is something more common to all of these philosophies that was left out of my training and education.
[00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.243]  And that was the ideology of collectivism.
[00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:56.927]  I began to realize that the thing that was common to them all is something called collectivism.
[00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.168]  Now that's a word that
[00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:00.609]  It's not very well used.
[00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.530]  It's not very entrenched in the vocabulary of most people today.
[00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:10.152]  But I found out that it was a very commonly used word about a century ago.
[00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:14.753]  People wrote a lot about collectivism, and the opposite of that would be individualism.
[00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:24.435]  Those are two words that are sort of abandoned today, but in my view, I think they need to be recaptured and understood and used more.
[00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:29.267]  America is big enough to make room for many different kinds of thinking.
[00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:37.429]  But many liberals have claimed to see virtues in socialism and communism, which I, for one, have not been able to find.
[00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:46.771]  To promote their ideas, American liberals have become a highly organized, hardcore establishment in the United States.
[00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:53.813]  And they have been excusing their appeasement and coddling of communism on the ground that they were being tolerant
[00:03:54.753 --> 00:03:55.453]  Broad-minded.
[00:03:56.313 --> 00:03:57.294]  And working for peace.
[00:03:58.034 --> 00:04:03.755]  Remember always that you not only have the right to be an individual, you have an obligation to be one.
[00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:05.316]  Eleanor Roosevelt.
[00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:07.876]  City Hall.
[00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:09.076]  Death and taxes.
[00:04:09.256 --> 00:04:12.517]  No time to have politics or religion.
[00:04:12.537 --> 00:04:16.558]  This is all the epitome of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:17.858]  Lay down, G.I.
[00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:18.879]  Lay down, G.I.
[00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:20.939]  We saw it all through the 20th century.
[00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.220]  And now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.501]  That we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:30.182]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:33.643]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:35.563]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[00:04:35.863 --> 00:04:37.824]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[00:04:38.124 --> 00:04:41.765]  Those that control my life and those that seek to control it even more!
[00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:43.385]  I want freedom!
[00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:44.446]  That's what I want!
[00:04:44.626 --> 00:04:45.826]  And that's what they should want!
[00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:52.672]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose of just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities.
[00:04:52.712 --> 00:04:54.714]  Because that is the central mode of control.
[00:04:54.794 --> 00:05:02.001]  Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.985]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:08.946]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:11.326]  The 21st century is going to be a new century.
[00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:20.848]  Not the century of slavery, not the century of lies, issues with no significance, and classism, statism, and all the rest of the modes of control.
[00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:24.709]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure, something right.
[00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:25.910]  What about your garden?
[00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.770]  It's a good one.
[00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.050]  It's got a garden and a sun and a republic in it.
[00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.091]  It's all about controlling the two sides of the same coin.
[00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:47.161]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:05:47.462 --> 00:05:49.744]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:05:50.064 --> 00:05:59.754]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:08.296]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% Made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:11.037]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:06:11.457 --> 00:06:15.698]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:06:16.058 --> 00:06:16.958]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.739]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:26.020]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.861]  We're good to go.
