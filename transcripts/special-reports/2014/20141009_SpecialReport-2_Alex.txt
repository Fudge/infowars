[00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:13.045]  I'll see you again in 25 years.
[00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.031]  Meanwhile...
[00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:25.198]  And like clockwork, David Lynch and Mark Frost have confirmed that the cult classic Twin Peaks will return to television in 2016.
[00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:36.343]  The original Twin Peaks storyline bent time and space and, well, reality to spin a fantastical tale that explored the seedy underlayer of small-town living.
[00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:46.248]  You got one dead homecoming queen, lots of damn good coffee and pie, a cryptic dream dwarf, doppelgangers, and David Duchovny in drag.
[00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:46.548]  Cool.
[00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:48.284]  Dennis?
[00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.769]  It was the first bizarro whodunit to capture the nation in prime time.
[00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:59.413]  The show ended unceremoniously with a finale that was more a series of cliffhangers.
[00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:08.841]  So, it should come as no surprise that one of the show's creators, David Lynch, was particularly interested in another story of unresolved surrealism.
[00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:28.392]  My listenership will crucify me if I don't at least mention the Dutch TV interview that you did and you commented on the film Loose Change 2nd edition and what happened with the Towers and you said people can't deal with that.
[00:01:29.232 --> 00:01:32.974]  Why did you even bring that up or did you know they were going to bring that up?
[00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:36.576]  You know, I knew they were going to bring it up and
[00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:40.119]  So, you know, you saw what I said.
[00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:48.203]  And those things for me that bother me is the hole in the Pentagon being too small for a plane.
[00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:55.547]  The lawn isn't messed up and the government's not showing the plane hitting when many cameras photographed it.
[00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:57.508]  Three buildings came down
[00:01:58.308 --> 00:01:58.628]  We need answers.
[00:01:58.648 --> 00:01:59.588]  We need answers.
[00:01:59.648 --> 00:01:59.928]  That's all.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:38.827]  Very good questions, David Lynch, but let's not forget about the magic passport or the family of Bin Laden flying out of the country the next day while the entire U.S.
[00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:40.848]  was under a no-fly order.
[00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.510]  And, of course, we've got office fires melting steel.
[00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:48.393]  There may not be a one-armed man, but it is the ultimate whodunit.
[00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:54.837]  Now, the new Twin Peaks will take place in the present day, and it's expected to answer some longstanding questions.
[00:02:55.398 --> 00:02:58.365]  Now, let's just hope we won't have to wait 25 years for some 9-11 truth.
[00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:15.207]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:25.394]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:03:25.714 --> 00:03:29.456]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:32.859]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.288]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.871]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:46.975]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:52.883]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:03:53.303 --> 00:03:59.972]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
