[00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:15.038]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and I'm standing here with... Gavin Syme.
[00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:16.458]  And who are you?
[00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:18.059]  I am a Liberty Speaker.
[00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:28.443]  I ran for Congress and lost this last year, but that's okay because we brought the whole race more constitutional and I tend to do activism, videos, things like that that's
[00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:45.589]  Mostly where I'm known from and just trying to encourage people to start standing up to the tyranny We see rising in America to start standing up for liberty and quit backing down To these these petulant childish bullies that call themselves the authority over us So what did you want to achieve by coming out here today?
[00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:52.632]  I know that we had the the remarks made by the officer about the MRAP being used for constitutionalists How does that make you feel?
[00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:59.297]  It makes me feel like we have a lawless government who has no respect for the people, and we see this all the time.
[00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:19.171]  I was actually, I'm not from this county, but we came up here a few weeks ago, a friend, Anthony Bosworth, a fellow patriot, and myself, and we went to the safety complex over by the sheriff's office due to the issue of unmarked cars, because in Washington State it's illegal for them to drive unmarked cars, and we had a big conversation that kind of went around the world a month or so ago about this, because we have
[00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.275]  Uh, these cars stopping people, people get raped, people get murdered, all kinds of stuff.
[00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:33.427]  In fact, in this county a few years ago, uh, a Mr. Creech actually got killed on his own property when an officer came in an unmarked car and parked there and he went out to check on it and he ended up getting shot.
[00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:34.268]  It was a terrible thing.
[00:01:34.768 --> 00:01:47.698]  The bottom line is, and where I'm going with this is whether it's unmarked cars, whether it's MRAPs and militarized police, there's an attitude among our public officials that they're in charge, that they are the masters and we are the servants, and it's not the other way around.
[00:01:48.218 --> 00:01:50.099]  They're the servants and we're the masters.
[00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.663]  So my reason for being out here supporting this is just to stand with these people.
[00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:57.565]  A lot of them were over in Olympia with us last week.
[00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:01.287]  We had the I-594 rally that is defying the new I-594 law.
[00:02:01.447 --> 00:02:03.489]  It was the largest felony, civil disobedience.
[00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:18.952]  In American history so myself and some of other of our team were organizing that they had another rally like that here today and then we came down here to stand with these guys and deal with this lawless sheriff that they have that thinks that that the people serve him instead of he serves the people
[00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:22.275]  Well, sir, we need more people like you throughout America.
[00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:23.276]  Thank you for being out here.
[00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:25.578]  I had a chance to watch your speech earlier.
[00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:35.207]  It was very moving, very motivational, and I hope a lot of people that watch this video at home right now are going to get the exact same feeling, that we've got to stand up to the tyranny that's going on in America.
[00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:36.268]  Thank you once again.
[00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:37.469]  Yeah, that's the bottom line.
[00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:38.370]  Liberty's not the fringe.
[00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.431]  Liberty's the foundation.
[00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.612]  We need to stand up for it.
[00:02:40.652 --> 00:02:42.434]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:02:53.635 --> 00:03:01.501]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding and making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:01.742 --> 00:03:03.823]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.626]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.789]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.272]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:21.558]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:25.859]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.680]  We are the true media.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.441]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:34.202]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
