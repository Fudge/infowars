[00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:17.246]  And today we're in Boston, Massachusetts, downtown, and we're going to ask the general public their thoughts about Operation Urban Shield that's taking place today.
[00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.889]  Multiple terrorism drills all over the city that involve federal agencies.
[00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.310]  Hi, do you know what the drills are for today?
[00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:28.232]  For terrorists, like, attacks.
[00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:29.853]  For terrorism.
[00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:33.714]  Just general terrorism preparedness.
[00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:34.455]  For safety.
[00:00:35.656 --> 00:00:36.597]  Uh, no, not quite.
[00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:45.845]  The only thing I can think is maybe sort of conditioning people to accept military action sort of on the streets, just kind of see it as a normal thing, you know what I mean?
[00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.386]  This exercise is great.
[00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:56.533]  It really showcases partnerships and working together, right, in different scenarios that would require first responders.
[00:00:57.054 --> 00:01:00.777]  Does it make you feel safe for having armed military and federal agents police the streets?
[00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:01.871]  Actually, yeah.
[00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:02.692]  It does.
[00:01:03.392 --> 00:01:03.912]  It does.
[00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:05.313]  Yes, it does.
[00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:09.655]  Well, how do you feel when you see the blue lights behind you in your car?
[00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:14.718]  Not really, because I'm a firm believer in what's going to happen is going to happen.
[00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:15.278]  You know what I mean?
[00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:21.542]  It just seems out of place in Boston, and it always made me uncomfortable, but after last year, I'm sort of used to it again.
[00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:24.263]  Do you think only the military should be allowed to carry guns?
[00:01:25.344 --> 00:01:25.924]  Absolutely not.
[00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:27.085]  I would say yes.
[00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:27.865]  No.
[00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:28.766]  I'm from Texas.
[00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:30.707]  I think everybody should be able to carry a gun.
[00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.752]  I feel it's the right for everybody to hold a gun and protect themselves.
[00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:38.656]  I personally feel that everybody should be able to bear arms to protect themselves.
[00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:45.644]  The Second Amendment says we have the right to bear arms and the Constitution says that we have the right to overthrow a tyrannical government.
[00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:54.253]  That's tough because I also used to live in London and they didn't have guns anywhere and it was a big deal when there was any gun violence.
[00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.835]  Honestly, I don't think anyone should be able to carry guns.
[00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:02.158]  Do you think giving up some civil liberties just to prevent terrorism needs to be done in this day and age?
[00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:04.780]  Wow, that's a deep question.
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.020]  Yes, I think so.
[00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.982]  I feel like it's a give-and-take situation.
[00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:11.384]  I feel like some liberties can be given up.
[00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:12.123]  No.
[00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:16.468]  It has though, but I don't think it has to be done.
[00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:22.175]  If they could give actual facts on how that would help to prevent it, but other than that I don't know.
[00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:24.898]  We have our liberties and we need to preserve them.
[00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.303]  Do you think these drills are to condition the public to get ready for a militarized police state?
[00:02:29.844 --> 00:02:30.304]  Absolutely.
[00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.366]  Yes, I do.
[00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:38.682]  I feel like it does, but I feel like a lot of other people, like families, it scares them and does probably affect the kids.
[00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:39.864]  Yeah, that will.
[00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:45.149]  Anytime you're holding a weapon, of course you want whoever is in the situation to be scared of you.
[00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:49.394]  It's a very different, pre 9-11 and post 9-11 are two completely different worlds.
[00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:54.416]  Do you ever remember the police 20 years ago looking like they do today with the black military uniform?
[00:02:54.797 --> 00:02:56.457]  Nah, nah, I don't really remember that.
[00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:57.178]  No.
[00:02:58.118 --> 00:02:58.318]  No.
[00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.199]  No, I don't.
[00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.442]  I remember the police were just the friendly neighborhood guys that they would help out.
[00:03:05.762 --> 00:03:09.884]  Police departments all over the country are now getting tanks and armed vehicles like the military.
[00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:11.665]  What do you think they're getting ready for?
[00:03:13.157 --> 00:03:13.838]  Another attack?
[00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:15.861]  There's a thought of a gun grab.
[00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:17.664]  Martial law.
[00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:18.605]  Something big.
[00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:20.648]  Maybe something is about to go down.
[00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:21.849]  That's what it sounds like.
[00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:24.286]  Probably terrorist attacks.
[00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:27.828]  Domestic terrorism is the reason they say they need all that stuff.
[00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:31.110]  But to come after the American people, basically.
[00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.931]  Oh no, I don't think they're that smart.
[00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.292]  We're giving them too much credit there.
[00:03:34.692 --> 00:03:40.975]  There are still Americans who question and feel uneasy about federal agencies and the military doing the local police department's jobs.
[00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:49.360]  However, there are many Americans who are now being conditioned on a mass scale and giving up their civil liberties to accept a police state.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.941]  Why?
[00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:52.025]  Because America has forgotten history.
[00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:55.110]  Those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:59.578]  And this is Dan Bodondi from Boston, Massachusetts for InfoWars.com
[00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:03.466]  The facts are in.
[00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:04.786]  The studies are legion.
[00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:12.412]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:16.034]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:16.814]  Simple.
[00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:21.398]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:24.920]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.142]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:04:27.402 --> 00:04:32.788]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:43.458]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:04:43.738 --> 00:04:45.600]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.961]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:50.162]  I use fluoride shield every day.
