[00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:15.008]  InfoWars has come here to Times Square to document the police state that surrounds the Super Bowl.
[00:00:15.228 --> 00:00:20.612]  And while the people know all the facts and figures about their favorite team, let's see if they know the facts and figures about Liberty.
[00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:21.733]  Excuse me, sir?
[00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:23.294]  Who's gonna win the Super Bowl?
[00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:24.635]  I think Denver's gonna win.
[00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:25.896]  Who's gonna win the Super Bowl?
[00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:27.297]  Seattle Seahawks.
[00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.703]  Hey, excuse me guys, why are the Broncos gonna win the Super Bowl?
[00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:31.244]  Tell me why.
[00:00:31.644 --> 00:00:33.165]  Peyton Manning and Peyton Manning only.
[00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:35.527]  Yeah, I'm gonna go with number 18, Peyton Manning.
[00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.148]  Tell me why you're gonna win the Super Bowl.
[00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.152]  Because we have something more than number 18, which is all the Bronco fans are talking about.
[00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:45.935]  They got Peyton Manning, we have 53, they have one.
[00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:48.237]  How many Super Bowls has Peyton Manning won?
[00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:48.817]  One.
[00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.810]  Payton Manning, how many Super Bowls has he won?
[00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:52.471]  One.
[00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:55.473]  And who's the quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks?
[00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:56.573]  Russell Wilson.
[00:00:56.954 --> 00:00:58.334]  Who's the quarterback for the Seahawks?
[00:00:58.735 --> 00:00:59.455]  Russell Wilson.
[00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:01.577]  Who's the quarterback of the Seahawks?
[00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:02.257]  Russell Wilson.
[00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:04.579]  Okay, let me ask you something that may actually matter.
[00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.741]  Do you know the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution?
[00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:10.442]  God, this is embarrassing.
[00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:13.044]  Could you name the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights?
[00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:14.865]  No.
[00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.668]  Alright, do you guys know the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution?
[00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.922]  Oh God, I'm embarrassed about that.
[00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:22.882]  I should know that.
[00:01:23.202 --> 00:01:28.585]  Can you name two of the Bill of Rights, the ten amendments in the Bill of Rights, any two?
[00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:32.426]  Freedom of religion, freedom of speech.
[00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:33.667]  Okay, that's the same one.
[00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:34.307]  You got one more?
[00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:37.869]  I don't know.
[00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.930]  Bill of Rights, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, liberty.
[00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.812]  To be safe in their personal effects from unreasonable
[00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:53.633]  The right of people to be safe in their persons against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:54.894]  I know your hat.
[00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.275]  I know what you guys are all about.
[00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:59.698]  Can you name any two of the Bill of Rights?
[00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:00.959]  You wanted something harder.
[00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:01.979]  Come on.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.961]  The Bill of Rights.
[00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:06.123]  You want number one or number two?
[00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:12.361]  Number one is the freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of speech.
[00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:14.583]  That's the only number one.
[00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:15.584]  Drop down.
[00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:18.127]  I don't know if freedom of religion would be part of the Bill of Rights.
[00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:22.652]  Probably not because religion and separation of government and religion.
[00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:26.857]  What is the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution?
[00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.038]  Seahawks win.
[00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:29.079]  Seahawks win.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.500]  What about number one?
[00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.890]  Seahawks win!
[00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.771]  Seahawks win.
[00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:34.412]  We really need 12 now, come on.
[00:02:34.472 --> 00:02:35.373]  We do not know this.
[00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:36.534]  We only know about football.
[00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:38.076]  We don't care about the Bill of Rights.
[00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:39.477]  We'll create the Bill of Rights.
[00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:40.678]  Only football, that's it.
[00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.940]  Who's the Vice President of the United States?
[00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.703]  Um... I don't know.
[00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:02.545]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:10.851]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:03:11.031 --> 00:03:15.694]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:22.617]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:29.740]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.743]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
