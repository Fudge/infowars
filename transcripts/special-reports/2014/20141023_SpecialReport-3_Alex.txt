[00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.391]  Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:15.351]  Now I'm sure a lot of you have heard about what's going on in Canada right now.
[00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:20.953]  One Canadian soldier has been killed and also a gunman has been killed.
[00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:27.935]  Right now we're still told that there are shooters out there and there is an active investigation still going on into what has happened.
[00:00:28.877 --> 00:00:46.568]  But, uh, you know, I was watching Fox News earlier and they had a live feed up and one of the things I caught the, uh, the anchor on the side of the road say is that the police are coming out saying, hey, don't post videos or photos of the ongoing incident as they happen just to ensure safety of responders and the public.
[00:00:47.188 --> 00:00:50.832]  You know, we heard that same thing happen when I was in Ferguson.
[00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:52.755]  Myself, Jakar Jackson, and Josh Owens.
[00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:55.778]  We heard the police come over there and say, no, don't film any of this stuff.
[00:00:55.798 --> 00:00:56.619]  Turn off your equipment.
[00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:57.340]  Stop recording.
[00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.787]  And this whole safety thing, I can kind of understand that, but at the same time, you have the right.
[00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:04.707]  To go out there and update things like that.
[00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:09.909]  That's how you get really good reporting done to find out what's going on because the police always want to try to hide stuff.
[00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.890]  Here's something interesting we caught while watching local Canadian TV.
[00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:27.894]  Now as you can see right here, you got the squad car, you got two police officers lined up and what's gonna happen is is they're gonna sit here and then take off at a dead sprint and run.
[00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.114]  You can see they have a
[00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:32.245]  This guy has a 9mm in his hand.
[00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:34.006]  So does this gentleman.
[00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.286]  These two guys right here.
[00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:38.868]  He's got an M4 and a handgun.
[00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:41.729]  This is what we notice right here.
[00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.029]  These guys come right over here.
[00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.790]  They slow down once they get out of the main view of the cameras.
[00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:47.851]  And they go off to the side.
[00:01:48.532 --> 00:01:50.672]  And you can see them laughing and smiling.
[00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:52.273]  And joking.
[00:01:52.313 --> 00:01:52.633]  Look at them.
[00:01:52.653 --> 00:01:54.054]  They're just like laughing.
[00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:56.415]  So the police are laughing and joking.
[00:01:56.455 --> 00:01:58.796]  And this kind of leads up to the fact whether or not
[00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.180]  Is this a false flag?
[00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:29.566]  The Senate security and the House of Commons security inside the building, obviously, are separate forces under separate command.
[00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:41.453]  If that assailant today had gone in the Senate door, which probably he easily could have, he would not have been met by armed force.
[00:02:41.774 --> 00:02:43.615]  He could have been right into the guts of the building.
[00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:50.443]  But at this point, all of the security forces in the House of Commons are not armed either.
[00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:52.145]  Now here's Craig Oliver.
[00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:55.469]  He is a parliamentary correspondent.
[00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.773]  He's a journalist and he reports a lot on those issues there.
[00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:02.242]  And he had a few interesting things to say.
[00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:08.945]  He says, Senate security is not armed, but then he comes back again and he goes, all security is not armed.
[00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:15.168]  So he said if a gunman were to rush right in there, he would not be met with any kind of force whatsoever.
[00:03:15.648 --> 00:03:16.549]  They wouldn't have weapons.
[00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.970]  So this leads me to think, all right, do they have weapons in their stash?
[00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.871]  And then there's a response time in case something happens.
[00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:27.974]  That's why eventually they did have weapons or they lock somewhere on the premises or what.
[00:03:29.181 --> 00:03:33.565]  I'm pretty sure they're going to change how they run their security after today's events.
[00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:36.688]  I'm pretty sure at this point you'll see people armed there every day.
[00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:41.312]  And then another thing as well though, you know, citizens, you know, citizens are allowed to be armed.
[00:03:41.332 --> 00:03:43.835]  If they saw something like this, they could stop it too as well.
[00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:52.183]  So it's just another thing to think about when you want to take guns from people and because you're so worried about people being offended by them or something like that.
[00:03:52.583 --> 00:04:10.572]  To be able to run from the War Memorial to Parliament Hill, I mean, someone would have to be in tough physical shape to be doing this in two or three or four or five minutes, carrying a weapon, without exciting any tourists or anybody who would be on the grounds and who would see that and probably would be tempted to call 911.
[00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:14.654]  Likely, the assailant wasn't alone.
[00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:15.975]  Likely, it was somebody else.
[00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.736]  Now, this is Michel Drapeau.
[00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:19.877]  He is a retired colonel.
[00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:22.599]  He worked at the University of Ottawa.
[00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.621]  He was their military law professor.
[00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:29.465]  Now what he's talking about is the assailant, the armed assailant who was gunned down.
[00:04:29.905 --> 00:04:34.869]  He said it's pretty much impossible for one person to have committed this crime.
[00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:46.138]  It would have had to have been more than one because he says this person would have had to have been so in shape to be able to run the distance from across the street where the war memorial is to get into Parliament and then go that way.
[00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:49.061]  He says there had to have been another person involved as well.
[00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.103]  Just a brief background about things that happened in Canada.
[00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:54.825]  The Toronto G20 riot fraud.
[00:04:55.186 --> 00:04:58.748]  Undercover police engaged in purposeful provocation.
[00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:03.452]  Now, this is one of a few incidents that's happened over that way.
[00:05:04.013 --> 00:05:08.776]  Also, Quebec police admit they went undercover at Montebello protests.
[00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:11.959]  These police officers went dressed up as thugs.
[00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:26.305]  Have sideways hats holding rocks in their hands and then to the left the riot police aren't doing anything about it They're not stopping them and they use them as a way to incite violence and get the crowd Very upset about what's going on now.
[00:05:26.365 --> 00:05:38.911]  We're not saying that this is a false flag, but it's definitely not a lone wolf incident there's still another person out there at large right now and You know I've made a couple of points earlier about
[00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:53.619]  Guns and I put out a tweet saying disarm the citizens and they will be targets for terrorist actions Hashtag pray for Ottawa, so I wasn't trying to be you know Crazy or anything like that.
[00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.581]  I just saying that you know when you disarm citizens They don't have a right to protect themselves.
[00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:07.544]  That's obviously a simple target for a terrorist action to happen and it you know has really upset quite a few people telling me that a
[00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:12.287]  Based on being sensitive and that I should go back to the States.
[00:06:13.588 --> 00:06:16.068]  Disarmed citizens and have lower gun crime rates.
[00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:17.429]  Jesus, what a stupid tweet.
[00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.510]  You know, it's pissed off a lot of people, basically.
[00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.831]  And someone said that they nominate this tweet to be the dumbest tweet of the year.
[00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:28.513]  So, you know, that's Canadian outlook on the situation.
[00:06:29.193 --> 00:06:34.456]  Me personally, I'd rather have the right to bear arms and have a way to protect myself, but some people don't feel that way.
[00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:36.457]  They think the police should have all the power.
[00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:43.380]  So, we're going to continue bringing you updates about what's happening in Ottawa, so stay tuned and look for more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:54.472 --> 00:06:56.514]  I want to know what's really happening with Ebola.
[00:06:56.974 --> 00:07:02.959]  I want to know if there are things out there that could protect this country and protect my three children, just as you do.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.922]  Government can't and won't protect you from Ebola.

[00:07:09.885 --> 00:07:14.730]  I'm not sitting back waiting for the government to come protect me and take care of me.
