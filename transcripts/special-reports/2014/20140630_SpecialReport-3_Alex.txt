[00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:13.494]  Good afternoon, how are you doing today?
[00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:13.875]  Good, you?
[00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:14.315]  Oh, not too bad.
[00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:15.957]  Can you tell me what your citizenship is, please, sir?
[00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:17.038]  I work at InfoWars.
[00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:18.639]  You know the Alex Jones Show?
[00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:19.300]  Oh, okay.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.701]  Is it playing on TV?
[00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:21.762]  Yes, I've heard of it.
[00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:25.646]  I haven't watched it, but... That's great, you've got to check it out.
[00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:29.029]  If you can sign up, you can use your password with up to 11 friends.
[00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.490]  Right.
[00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.910]  Oh, okay.
[00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.951]  Keep that in mind.
[00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.173]  Can you tell me what your citizenship is, please, sir?
[00:00:33.213 --> 00:00:33.874]  Yeah, I live here.
[00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:34.495]  Okay, well...
[00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.139]  Well, a lot of people live here.
[00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.962]  Well, sir, I guess we're just trying to figure out what exactly you're trying to accomplish.
[00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.504]  I'm sorry, sir, can you... Oh, sure.
[00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:45.464]  I'll move over here.
[00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:46.665]  I'm sorry.
[00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:47.346]  Yes, sir, I'm sorry.
[00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.227]  I'm just wondering, what are you trying to accomplish?
[00:00:49.627 --> 00:00:51.648]  Well, this is a checkpoint.
[00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.350]  It's a secondary enforcement of...
[00:00:56.215 --> 00:01:02.439]  The border security, as we know, we can't catch everybody at the border, so this is a secondary to catch.
[00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.262]  Well sir, I'll tell you, if you want to catch the people, I can tell you they're at Lackland Air Force Base.
[00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:08.783]  They're in McAllen, Texas.
[00:01:08.863 --> 00:01:11.625]  El Paso as well.
[00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:15.847]  Unfortunately, we don't control what happens after they've been caught.
[00:01:16.148 --> 00:01:17.388]  Yeah, I understand that sir.
[00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:19.670]  I'm telling you, if you want to find something, we can tell you.
[00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.751]  I can draw you a map, I can show you a picture.
[00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:24.513]  We know exactly where those people are too, but this is for those people.
[00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.154]  We haven't yet made it there.
[00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:26.495]  Right.
[00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:29.497]  Can you tell me what your citizenship is, please, sir?
[00:01:29.537 --> 00:01:31.419]  Well, I live in the state of Texas.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.561]  Okay, so is that where you were born?
[00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:34.963]  Were you born here in the U.S., sir?
[00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:38.886]  I was not born in the state of Texas, if that's what you're asking.
[00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:43.671]  No, I was just asking if you were born in the United States, just so I can ensure your citizenship.
[00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:46.232]  I assure you, sir, I'm no criminal.
[00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:47.293]  I'm not doing anything wrong.
[00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:53.576]  If you'd like to know where the illegal immigrants are, sir, I can show you videos and pictures and all that stuff.
[00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:55.437]  And Ken, I know just where that is.
[00:01:55.857 --> 00:01:56.217]  Alright, sir.
[00:01:56.597 --> 00:01:59.138]  And you said that you were from the U.S.
[00:01:59.158 --> 00:01:59.458]  as well?
[00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:00.479]  I live in Texas, sir.
[00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:02.260]  Alright, sir.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.940]  Thank you.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.320]  Thank you.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.461]  You have a good day, officer.
[00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:09.117]  That's how you do it, guys.
[00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:11.900]  InfoWars.com.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.681]  And he said he knew where they were, right?
[00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:15.283]  He's like, yeah, I know they're in Lackland.
[00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:16.524]  I know they're in McAllen, Texas.
[00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:18.126]  So that's what you guys got to do.
[00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:19.127]  It's just like the TSA.
[00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:19.868]  You got to opt out.
[00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:22.230]  More reports, InfoWars.com.
[00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.632]  Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, InfoWars.com.
[00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:24.913]  Woo!
