[00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:14.801]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com here at the University of Texas in Austin.
[00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:19.226]  Now, there's a trend going around college campuses nationwide.
[00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:21.115]  It's all the new rave.
[00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:22.676]  Post-birth abortions.
[00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:24.798]  A lot of you probably never heard of that term.
[00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:26.879]  I know I hadn't until yesterday.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:36.607]  Well, post-birth abortion is after the baby is born and up until five years old when it's able to make decisions or is self-aware, you can still kill the baby.
[00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:38.862]  Now, I know that seems shocking.
[00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:40.263]  It seems shocking to me.
[00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:45.946]  But, there's a lot of college kids around the country who agree with killing babies up into the age of 4 or 5.
[00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:51.749]  So I came out here today to find out whether or not UT agrees with post-birth abortion.
[00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:53.150]  Let's go see what happens.
[00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.371]  A lot of people, they have botched abortions.
[00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:57.412]  You know what that is?
[00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:00.894]  And what this is, is a post-birth abortion act of 2014.
[00:01:00.974 --> 00:01:04.135]  If you want to sign it or not.
[00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:06.557]  But you can take a look over it and
[00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:11.431]  Stephanie, right?
[00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:13.032]  Thank you, have a good day.
[00:01:13.152 --> 00:01:13.493]  You too.
[00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.913]  Thanks for signing the Post-Abortion Act.
[00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:21.517]  That's pretty funny.
[00:01:21.537 --> 00:01:23.098]  No, I can't support stuff like that.
[00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:24.439]  Why can't you support stuff like that?
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.561]  That sounds awful.
[00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:28.101]  Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
[00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:28.462]  Yeah.
[00:01:28.582 --> 00:01:30.343]  Alright, well, thank you for being that way.
[00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:32.584]  Hopefully more people agree that.
[00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:34.565]  The more the merrier.
[00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:35.686]  Alright.
[00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:38.768]  The more we can help empower women.
[00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:41.195]  Hey there, how's it going?
[00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:41.255]  Hi!
[00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:43.236]  You wanna help empower women?
[00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:44.856]  I'll just sign it.
[00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:45.837]  You'll just sign it?
[00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:46.317]  Okay.
[00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:48.237]  Well, it's all about empowering women.
[00:01:49.278 --> 00:01:51.158]  Um, no, keep talking, I'm just signing a paper.
[00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.099]  Nice suit, seems like you're hot in there.
[00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.659]  Nah!
[00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.040]  You look cool, you look cool.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.680]  Well, at least I'm alive, I made it.
[00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:00.141]  Yes.
[00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:03.742]  Unlike these babies who are gonna die.
[00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:04.682]  For this.
[00:02:05.722 --> 00:02:07.023]  But in what context, can I read it?
[00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:08.363]  Uh, post-birth abortion.
[00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:17.925]  Women who have botched abortions, sometimes they fail, and it's to give them the ability to go ahead and go through with it after the baby's been born.
[00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:21.206]  Oh.
[00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:32.088]  So first of all, I can't even, I don't even have a comment on this, because it's ridiculous.
[00:02:33.308 --> 00:02:35.309]  Hey, so, I'm glad you made that decision.
[00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:36.229]  Thank you.
[00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:37.726]  Because guess what?
[00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:40.748]  You have three students that go to this school that think that's a good idea.
[00:02:41.408 --> 00:02:43.050]  You might want to talk to some of your friends around here.
[00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.030]  What is it?
[00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.392]  It's to give women the right to have abortions.
[00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:47.133]  Okay.
[00:02:47.573 --> 00:02:48.714]  You're signing away?
[00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:50.255]  Yeah, they're just post-birth abortions.
[00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:50.775]  Okay.
[00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.038]  So, basically, a lot of abortions get botched.
[00:02:54.058 --> 00:02:55.539]  They don't work.
[00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:56.119]  Yeah.
[00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.064]  And the baby gets born anyway, so it gives the mother the opportunity to continue on with it.
[00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:12.252]  Um, it's to help give women the right to make the decision to have a post-birth abortion if they want.
[00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:14.713]  Post-birth?
[00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:15.293]  Yeah.
[00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:19.794]  That means if there's a botched abortion attempt, and it's stillborn, they can still do it right away.
[00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:20.894]  Okay.
[00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:26.536]  Alright, it's just a post-birth abortion.
[00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:27.816]  What does that mean?
[00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:33.557]  What does that mean is if there's a botched abortion, and the baby's stillborn, they can just do it right then, terminate immediately.
[00:03:33.577 --> 00:03:35.978]  They're not doing that.
[00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:37.355]  No, that's wrong.
[00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:39.316]  Abortion if they want to or not.
[00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:45.077]  I already know what I'm signing.
[00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:47.938]  Thank you.
[00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:51.799]  Look, there's a camera up there and I'm making sure that you're not an evil person.
[00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.400]  Look, you have a lot of students here.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.720]  That's freaking ridiculous.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.680]  Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.501]  Like, who would sign that without- No, guess what?
[00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:04.723]  There's people who read this that says they're allowing kids up to five years old to be killed.
[00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:10.087]  Please tell me that you do not agree with this.
[00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:13.028]  I have a huge issue with this.
[00:04:13.088 --> 00:04:16.490]  It's really making me so angry that people are signing.
[00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.792]  These people are horrible people.
[00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:21.533]  Why?
[00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:22.793]  Is this embarrassing?
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.301]  So thank you for being a good human being.
[00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:32.221]  I appreciate it.
[00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:32.341]  Sorry.
[00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:33.141]  Yeah!
[00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:33.662]  High five.
[00:04:34.022 --> 00:04:34.482]  What's your name?
[00:04:34.742 --> 00:04:35.002]  Mila.
[00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:35.762]  Mila.
[00:04:36.403 --> 00:04:37.283]  Nice to meet you, Mila.
[00:04:37.303 --> 00:04:39.244]  Do you support abortion?
[00:04:39.384 --> 00:04:39.584]  Yeah.
[00:04:40.024 --> 00:04:42.925]  Okay, well this gives women the right to have post-birth abortions.
[00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:45.986]  And you can look it over if you want, or just sign away.
[00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:46.526]  It's up to you.
[00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:47.907]  So what are you going to school for?
[00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:49.287]  Nursing.
[00:04:50.068 --> 00:04:50.568]  Nursing, huh?
[00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:51.788]  Okay.
[00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:54.649]  What are you going for?
[00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.470]  Government.
[00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.630]  What?
[00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.190]  Look at you.
[00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.551]  I'm signing to buy the film.
[00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:00.307]  What are your aspirations?
[00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:01.208]  Yeah.
[00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:01.928]  Be a politician.
[00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:02.068]  Yeah?
[00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:05.391]  You're gonna be honest and tell the truth and nothing but the truth?
[00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:06.872]  So help me God?
[00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:07.373]  Yeah.
[00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:07.533]  Okay.
[00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:09.395]  Well, that's what we need.
[00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:10.135]  Alright.
[00:05:10.315 --> 00:05:10.575]  Thanks.
[00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.520]  Just making sure I'm signing the right thing.
[00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:17.982]  Good luck!
[00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:18.582]  Thank you!
[00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:22.425]  Alright, I gotta write this down.
[00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:23.406]  Future politician.
[00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:24.667]  I'm just reading it.
[00:05:24.827 --> 00:05:25.188]  Yeah, cool.
[00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.609]  Check it out.
[00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:28.822]  Okay, that's really weird.
[00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:29.383]  What?
[00:05:29.903 --> 00:05:33.504]  The person that signed before me has the same last name as me.
[00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:35.304]  Oh, you said Bainter?
[00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:36.125]  Yeah.
[00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:39.066]  She's gonna be a politician, you're gonna be a musician.
[00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:42.527]  You got it?
[00:05:43.087 --> 00:05:44.107]  You ready to go?
