[00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:08.827]  Well, today we were told that Rand Paul was going to filibuster the appointment of David Barron.
[00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:09.548]  Why?
[00:00:09.988 --> 00:00:22.816]  Because David Barron, who's up for appointment to one court below the Supreme Court, a lifetime appointment, was one of the people who wrote memos that pretended to justify the assassination of Americans abroad using drones.
[00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:25.458]  This is why the filibuster was cut short.
[00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:30.221]  This nomination would not go forward were it not for the elimination of the filibuster.
[00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:34.263]  Some say the filibuster was, oh, that was obstructionism.
[00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:41.874]  The filibuster was also, in many cases, about trying to prevent extremists from getting on the bench.
[00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:46.100]  Now, Rand Paul and Senator Grassley were trying to get these memos released to the public.
[00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:53.844]  Finally, since this happened in 2011, three years after the fact, Obama has finally released this for senators to take a look at it.
[00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:59.126]  But it's still not available for the public, nor will it be until after they've made this decision.
[00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:03.768]  But Rand Paul wanted to talk about what's really involved here with due process.
[00:01:03.888 --> 00:01:09.490]  It's not just about transparency, it's about death by accusation and what has happened to our due process.
[00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.452]  The debate is not about transparency.
[00:01:13.312 --> 00:01:15.613]  It is about the substance of the memos.
[00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:27.232]  I cannot and will not support a lifetime appointment of someone who believes it is okay to kill an American citizen not involved in combat without a trial.
[00:01:27.772 --> 00:01:32.073]  Glenn Greenwald writes this about both the Bush and the Obama administration.
[00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:43.395]  He says, the core of the distortion on the war on terror under both Bush and Obama is the Orwellian practice of equating government accusations of terrorism with proof of guilt.
[00:01:44.048 --> 00:01:49.794]  Due process cannot occur in secret, but it also can't occur in one branch of government.
[00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:53.337]  This is a fundamental misconception of the President.
[00:01:53.917 --> 00:02:08.051]  The President believes, with regard to either privacy in the Fourth Amendment, or to killing American citizens, and with regard to the Fifth Amendment, he believes that if he has some lawyers review this process, that that is due process.
[00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:12.362]  This is appalling because this has nothing to do with due process.
[00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:21.445]  He also had this to say about reasonable doubt and how that's been replaced by imminent and pay attention to what they've done to the definition of the word imminent.
[00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:30.027]  When we talk about convictions, we talk about the conviction or the bar for conviction being beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:34.964]  So you can pretty much think, you can be in a jury pool and pretty much think someone killed someone.
[00:02:35.265 --> 00:02:38.366]  You've got a suspicion, you have an inclination they're probably guilty.
[00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:41.827]  But you're supposed to be so convinced that it's beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:45.668]  In these memos, there's a different standard.
[00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:54.171]  Realize what the standard is from the person who will we now be pointing to a lifetime appointment, one step below the Supreme Court, the standard is
[00:02:54.918 --> 00:03:00.941]  That an assassination is justified when an informed, high-level official of the U.S.
[00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:08.886]  government has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States.
[00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:17.010]  The interesting thing about an imminent attack is we really don't go by much the plain wording of what you would think would be imminent anymore.
[00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:30.598]  The memo expressly states that it is inventing a broader concept of imminence that is typically not used.
[00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:35.422]  Specifically, the President's assassination power does not require that the U.S.
[00:03:35.462 --> 00:03:40.207]  have clear evidence that a specific attack will take place in the immediate future.
[00:03:40.914 --> 00:03:46.277]  So you wonder about a definite of imminence that no longer includes the word immediate.
[00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:55.382]  Rand Paul directly addressed his Democrat colleagues and tried to get beyond partisanship, pointing out that they wouldn't vote for this guy if he was a Bush appointee.
[00:03:55.962 --> 00:04:02.325]  The definition of terrorism, since on some occasions we've been accused of terrorism by the other side, can be somewhat loose.
[00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:07.528]  The Bureau of Justice put out a memo describing some of the characteristics of people who might be terrorists.
[00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:10.417]  Which might alarm you if you're traveling overseas.
[00:04:10.957 --> 00:04:12.238]  People are missing fingers.
[00:04:12.678 --> 00:04:14.460]  People have stains on their clothing.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.882]  People have changed the color of their hair.
[00:04:17.542 --> 00:04:19.483]  People have multiple weapons in their house.
[00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:22.986]  People have more than seven days worth of food in their house.
[00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:26.529]  These are people you should be suspicious of, according to the government.
[00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:28.490]  These are people who might be terrorists.
[00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.654]  And these are people you should talk to and inform the government about these people.
[00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:41.739]  If these are the definitions of someone who might be a terrorist, wouldn't we kind of want to have a lawyer before the accusation becomes a conviction?
[00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:45.762]  Now I want you to listen to what he has to say about who a terrorist is.
[00:04:46.303 --> 00:04:48.343]  And wonder if this applies to you, because you know what?
[00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:50.564]  It's not Alaki who's on trial.
[00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:51.525]  He's long dead.
[00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:56.067]  It's your constitutional, God-given rights that are on trial here.
[00:04:57.027 --> 00:05:01.269]  And the only person who's rising in an adversarial position here is Rand Paul.
[00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:09.832]  But the American people, who are really on trial here, the American people are not even showing up for their own trial out of apathy.
[00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:12.073]  We'll close with what Rand Paul had to say about terrorism.
[00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:28.894]  You're voting for someone who has made this the historic precedent for how we will kill Americans overseas, in secret, by one branch of the administration, without representation, based upon an accusation that I would oppose this nomination work coming from a Republican president.
[00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:39.177]  But what I would ask my Democrat colleagues is to look deep within their soul, to look deep within their psyche and say, how would I vote if this were a Bush nominee?
[00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:50.100]  If this were a Bush nominee that had written legal opinions justifying torture in 2007, 2006, 2005, how would I have voted?
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.622]  I think 90% would have voted against and would vote now against a Bush nominee.
[00:05:56.243 --> 00:05:59.684]  This has become partisan and this body has become too partisan.
[00:06:00.144 --> 00:06:06.927]  There was a time when there were great believers in the Constitution in this body and we have degenerated into a body of partisanship.
[00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:22.065]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:24.347]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:06:24.527 --> 00:06:29.732]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:06:29.892 --> 00:06:34.977]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:06:35.117 --> 00:06:38.218]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.420]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew link to numerous conditions.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.942]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:06:47.022 --> 00:06:57.127]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
