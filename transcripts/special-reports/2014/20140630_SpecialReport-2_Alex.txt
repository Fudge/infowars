[00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:06.819]  Hi, how are you doing?
[00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.500]  Jakari Jackson, InfoWars.com.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.900]  We sent you the form.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.341]  We never received it back from you.
[00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:13.981]  What time did you send me the form?
[00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.642]  I don't recall the exact time, but we sent you the form.
[00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:17.362]  We're not keeping it.
[00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:18.742]  We're not keeping it, I'm sorry.
[00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:25.544]  Well, sir, I'll tell you, I spoke to, I don't know if you're the gentleman I spoke to yesterday, Jose, but I spoke to the gentleman yesterday.
[00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:27.464]  He said he would send me the information.
[00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.645]  As of last night, I still hadn't gotten it.
[00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:35.346]  So, it's kind of like, you know, he said... Emails were sent out, so people couldn't fill out the information.
[00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:45.395]  So, I mean, sir, I'm just trying to understand, because I sent out, I was talking to the guy, he said he would send me the email, he never did.
[00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:50.519]  So, you know... The press conference is taking place now, you're not pre-credentialed.
[00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.800]  Thank you.
[00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:53.330]  Can I just walk in there?
[00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.490]  Do I need to be pre-credentialed?
[00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.711]  You have to be pre-credentialed.
[00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:57.852]  If you don't have the pre-credentials, you cannot enter.
[00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.954]  Is there any other media PIO I could talk to?
[00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:01.595]  No, sir.
[00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:02.596]  You want a supervisor?
[00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:04.197]  My supervisor's right over there.
[00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:05.497]  I know this isn't your issue.
[00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:07.178]  I'm trying to talk to that guy or somebody.
[00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.499]  That's all I have to say, sir.
[00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:11.821]  But there's nobody representing that guy that I could talk to.
[00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:12.622]  No, sir.
[00:01:14.563 --> 00:01:14.703]  Ms.
[00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:17.845]  Pelosi, your daughter said there's no way to secure the border.
[00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:19.606]  Did you fill her head with that nonsense?
[00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:21.648]  Or is that because you guys just don't want to do your job?
[00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:33.183]  And here we are.
[00:01:33.223 --> 00:01:34.243]  That's the question I asked.
[00:01:34.263 --> 00:01:35.503]  So I didn't get much of a response.
[00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:39.204]  Kind of put her head down and rushed out of here in her convoy.
[00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:41.505]  But it's kind of funny the spot she picked.
[00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:43.345]  If you look, we got the swing set.
[00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:44.526]  There's a school in the background.
[00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.606]  Because like she said during the conference, that it's all about the children.
[00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:50.587]  This humanitarian crisis is all about the children.
[00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:59.209]  But when I spoke to the Vice President of the Border Patrol Unit two days ago, he said that the cartels were using these children as a beard.
[00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:09.895]  And what was happening was we're pulling these Border Patrol agents off our borders and allowing these other immigrants across our borders, such as like the Chinese.
[00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:11.096]  He said there was Pakistani.
[00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:15.979]  So right now we're leaving our borders open for drug smuggling and terrorists to come in.
[00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.301]  And that's a huge national security threat.
[00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:19.421]  They don't talk about that.
[00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.244]  They just talk about trying to win the hearts and minds of the American people with these kids.
[00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:28.447]  And they never want to cut through to the real issue, which is our national security and our borders being wide open.
[00:02:29.093 --> 00:02:29.755]  I'm Joe Biggs.
