[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.341]  A new online game teaches kids about vaccination.
[00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:14.502]  This vaccination is a teeny tiny bit of the flu virus.
[00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:17.162]  It'll teach your body how to fight the flu virus.
[00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:18.943]  Let's fight the flu virus!
[00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:28.505]  What the PBS produced plot fails to teach kids is that getting the flu vaccine might actually increase their risk of getting other more dangerous forms of the flu.
[00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:39.555]  Research confirmed that the seasonal flu vaccine may actually weaken children's immune systems and increase their chances of getting sick from influenza viruses not included in the vaccine.
[00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.638]  It's a condition they call Original Antigenic Sin.
[00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:52.808]  It basically means if you get infected with a natural virus, that gives you not only protection against that virus, but similar viruses or even quite different flu viruses in the next year.
[00:00:53.348 --> 00:01:07.577]  According to a professor from the Australian National University, we may be perversely setting ourselves up that if something really new and nasty comes along, the people who have been vaccinated may, in fact, be more susceptible compared to getting this natural infection.
[00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:15.422]  Now that Obamacare is being peddled to Hollywood writers, we can expect to see even more healthcare-related propaganda in children's shows.
[00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:23.888]  Children may be taught the importance of having health insurance, and of course, convincing their parents how important it is to sign up for the Affordable Care Act as well.
[00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:28.751]  One program to keep an eye on is Disney's federally funded cartoon, Doc McStuffins.
[00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:49.265]  The show was created under the consultancy of the Hollywood Health and Society, which is a federally funded organization through which public health and medical experts offer expert consultation, education, and resources for writers and producers who develop scripts with health storylines and information.
[00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:55.288]  This is the same group who will gather with members of the Hollywood elite for a panel titled, The Affordable Care Act.
[00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.470]  Comedy, drama, and reality.
[00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.231]  Portraying Obamacare in TV and film.
[00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:09.797]  Given that Obama has declared he will assert his unilateral agenda, it's clear that Hollywood is filled with eager servants ready to do the bidding of their dear leader.
