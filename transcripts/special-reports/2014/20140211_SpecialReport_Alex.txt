[00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:17.517]  Reports have surfaced from top researchers that a plume of Fukushima radiation will contact the United States sometime in 2014.
[00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:20.718]  With that in mind, we've been on a West Coast tour.
[00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:22.959]  We've gone as far north as Portland, Oregon.
[00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.621]  Now we're back down in sunny California because right beneath this location, just a little bit south of San Francisco at Half Moon Bay,
[00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:30.941]  Are you a local resident?
[00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:31.061]  I am.
[00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.242]  And you haven't heard about these radiation levels?
[00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:33.802]  No, no I haven't.
[00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:57.363]  No, but I know about Half Moon Bay.
[00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.304]  That's the place that's always the wettest place in the U.S.
[00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:01.625]  Is that a fact?
[00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:02.945]  No, I don't know.
[00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:04.145]  Are you a local resident?
[00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:04.526]  Yeah.
[00:01:04.706 --> 00:01:06.346]  And this is your first time hearing this information?
[00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:07.146]  Yes.
[00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:08.627]  Are you a local resident here?
[00:01:08.647 --> 00:01:08.707]  Yes.
[00:01:08.827 --> 00:01:10.567]  And you haven't heard about this information?
[00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:11.167]  What is this for?
[00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:13.268]  Well, this is for InfoWars.com.
[00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:18.530]  We're trying to tell the people out there about the excessive levels of radiation that are going on just a little bit south of here.
[00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.990]  No, I haven't heard anything about them.
[00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:25.472]  The highest levels of radiation have been centered right around here at Half Moon Bay, just a little bit south of here.
[00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:26.753]  Oh, that's horrible.
[00:01:27.813 --> 00:01:29.414]  Sorry, I don't want to be on camera, I quote it.
[00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:29.754]  Thank you.
[00:01:29.774 --> 00:01:32.356]  I don't like to be filmed without my permission.
[00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:38.199]  Okay, sir, I'll tell you that the NSA films you every day through your laptop, and also these traffic cameras film you too.
[00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.501]  So, they're filming you without your permission too.
[00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:42.442]  Just be aware of that, sir.
[00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:45.263]  Have you heard about the melting starfish?
[00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:46.584]  No, that I have not.
[00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:48.669]  Uh, no, actually.
[00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.490]  You have not?
[00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.830]  Mm-mm.
[00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.291]  Well, sir, let me just ask you this.
[00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:53.213]  What type of information are you really into?
[00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:55.054]  What gets you up in the morning?
[00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:56.416]  What's the first thing you look for in the morning?
[00:01:57.056 --> 00:01:58.037]  I do, you know...
[00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:06.790]  I have an interest in global warming, those kinds of large-scale environmental issues, but I can't say as I've heard of the localized radiation thing.
[00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.092]  The government has purchased about 14 million doses of potassium iodide.
[00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:13.713]  Now, you use that to protect your body from radiation.
[00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:20.796]  Would it concern you to know that they're buying all this radiation protection and not informing the general public?
[00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:21.316]  Sure.
[00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:22.957]  It seems like they obviously know something we don't, then.
[00:02:23.317 --> 00:02:27.539]  Would it be too much to speculate that maybe the government knows something that they're not sharing with the general public?
[00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:30.630]  Um, I think that's too much.
[00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.791]  I could not make that link.
[00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:38.236]  I don't want it to be a Republican conspiracy to take over the United States again.
[00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:40.759]  A Republican conspiracy?
[00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:50.847]  Is it, I mean, is it a conspiracy that Steve Weiss, an electrical engineer who makes Geiger counters, went out there and found radiation levels 1,400% normal, higher than normal?
[00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:52.129]  Is that a conspiracy, sir?
[00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.130]  I don't know if it's a conspiracy.
[00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.652]  It's just an observation.
[00:02:56.388 --> 00:03:07.310]  After meeting all the awake, vibrant, lovely people just a little bit southwest of here in Half Moon Bay, I'm somewhat discouraged that about half the people we talked to today just had no interest in these issues.
[00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.971]  I guess they're more concerned with the 49ers, about their trendiness, their new iPhone, or whatever else.
[00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:14.451]  But these are real issues and you need to take action.
[00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.752]  Sometimes just walking out here and talking to people can wake people up.
[00:03:18.012 --> 00:03:20.192]  Some people were very receptive of this information.
[00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:23.293]  And for the other people who may have been on vacation and just didn't care,
[00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:29.582]  We met people in Half Moon Bay who were on vacation and they care just as much as the people who live right there in Half Moon Bay.
[00:03:29.822 --> 00:03:35.570]  So stay tuned to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv as we bring you more reports on our West Coast tour.
