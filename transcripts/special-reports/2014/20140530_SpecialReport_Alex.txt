[00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:15.527]  For the last eight years of my life, ever since I've hit puberty, I've been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires.
[00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:18.909]  All because girls have never been attracted to me.
[00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:28.597]  Girls gave their affection, and sex, and love to other men, but never to me.
[00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.792]  Is that a good reason to kill somebody?
[00:00:31.972 --> 00:00:35.916]  Let alone multiple people who had nothing to do with your supposed rejection.
[00:00:36.377 --> 00:00:40.261]  That's a perfect example of murdering out of a sense of entitlement.
[00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:42.923]  But Roger wasn't the first or the last.
[00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:46.587]  A teen in North Carolina stabbed and beat his parents to death.
[00:00:46.687 --> 00:00:49.990]  For the heinous crime of taking away his iPod.
[00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.754]  The 16-year-old is being tried as an adult for two counts of second-degree murder.
[00:00:55.175 --> 00:01:01.240]  Elsewhere, a boy in Saudi Arabia allegedly shot his father over a refusal to buy a PlayStation.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.664]  Some Arabic media has labeled the child the youngest killer in Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:17.548]  Not only did these parents die for no good reason, but it shows the dependency of youth on their mobile devices, and how when they are separated from their glowing binky, children don't know what to do with themselves.
[00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:23.071]  But sometimes it's adults who end the life of a child, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
[00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.052]  If you're a parent, try to imagine this scenario.
[00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:29.153]  A speeding motorist running over your child, killing them.
[00:01:29.713 --> 00:01:34.715]  Then the motorist has the audacity to sue you, the family, for emotional distress.
[00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:44.120]  Much like the officer at UC Berkeley pepper spraying peaceful protesters, then wanting workers' compensation because people made fun of him on the internet.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.741]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:55.694 --> 00:01:59.035]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:01.376]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:09.860]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:25.466]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:26.166]  Let's go!
