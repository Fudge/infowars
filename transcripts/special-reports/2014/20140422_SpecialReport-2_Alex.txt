[00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:02.105]  We're live.
[00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:03.226]  It's 2-0-8 Central.
[00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:06.910]  And two explosions at Boston Marathon.
[00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:09.453]  People hurt in large explosions.
[00:00:09.773 --> 00:00:10.354]  Oh, man.
[00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:12.557]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.600]  And that old... Are they going to blame it on Iran?
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.722]  Blame it on the Patriot group?
[00:00:17.808 --> 00:00:17.988]  Are you
[00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:51.483]  At the airport, then it's the mall, then it's the sports stadium, then it's the hotel, then it's the highway, then it's the bus station, this is already in Austin, then it's Army at the Kite Festival, then it's, oh, any event has to have, you know, troops at it.
[00:00:51.824 --> 00:01:00.791]  Drudge now running the headline, explosions at Boston Marathon, and it goes multiple people injured, at least a dozen injured after explosion.
[00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:04.795]  I hope this isn't a false flag or a real terror attack, Richard.
[00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:10.239]  Even if it's innocent, they will use it because everyone's focused on it now.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.326]  And people can be controlled when they're all on the same emotion at the same time.
[00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:21.790]  You know, the government's been studying this since, you know, World War I. Let's fade this out.
[00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.930]  CNN?
[00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.155]  There's a whole process underway right now, but the reality of the situation is it is almost impossible
[00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:35.758]  To protect an event, especially one that is over a protracted space, as a marathon is.
[00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.300]  And, you know, I hate to say it, but these are the times that we live in.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.981]  Richard, that's what they're saying on CNN.
[00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:44.762]  So they're already basically saying it's a terror attack.
[00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:45.542]  Oh my goodness.
[00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:47.664]  No, we're helpless is what he's saying.
[00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:48.425]  I know this.
[00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:51.289]  They got TSA ready to roll out nationwide.
[00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.312]  They're already doing it, but they've, they've been, I've talked to insiders.
[00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:55.814]  They're going to be everywhere now.
[00:01:55.894 --> 00:01:57.536]  Just federal checkpoints.
[00:01:57.857 --> 00:02:00.940]  When he said, you know, unfortunately these are the times we live in.
[00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:12.028]  So then when we see soldiers at our kids' Little League game, we see soldiers, you know, everywhere, we're supposed to feel safe?
[00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:21.855]  But again, the explosion, the main one there at the Marathon Sports, and then you can hear after that, Paula, it's just absolutely heartbreaking to see this.
[00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.117]  It's been a year since the bomb attack at the Boston Marathon.
[00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:29.820]  InfoWars was pointing out the inconsistencies in the story from the very beginning.
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.541]  Was there any prior knowledge of it?
[00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:37.925]  Because according to BostonGlobe.com, they said they were doing drills this morning for the same exact thing to happen, according to BostonGlobe.com.
[00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:41.788]  Now, were you guys given any warning ahead of time of this taking place?
[00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.310]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence.
[00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.873]  Sir, why were loudspeakers telling people in the audience to be calm moments before the bomb went off?
[00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:56.358]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security sticking their hands down on the pants on the streets?
[00:02:56.658 --> 00:02:56.838]  No.
[00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:00.359]  And it wasn't just the Boston Globe who reported the drills.
[00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:13.902]  There was dogs with their handlers going around sniffing for explosives and we were told on a loud announcement that we shouldn't be concerned.
[00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:15.062]  This was just a drill.
[00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.963]  So maybe it was just a drill.
[00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:23.357]  But I've just never seen a drill like that.
[00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:44.765]  Reports show that the older Tsarnaev had previously attended a workshop sponsored by the CIA.
[00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:53.410]  The word is also out that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security had been tipped to Tamerlan's visit to a radical mosque in Dagestan, a neighbor of Chetsnya.
[00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.732]  The FBI felt that this was of little consequence and didn't consider him a threat.
[00:03:58.353 --> 00:04:04.096]  Also, the suspect's uncle Ruslan, who quickly distanced himself from his nephews, worked for UCEDD.
[00:04:04.436 --> 00:04:05.537]  As the article points out,
[00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:06.407]  The U.S.
[00:04:06.548 --> 00:04:10.311]  Agency for International Development is an agency used by the U.S.
[00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:17.178]  government to operate humanitarian NGOs instrumental in running color revolutions in former Soviet states.
[00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:21.702]  And he just so happened to be the relative of choice for state-run media.
[00:04:22.443 --> 00:04:25.926]  I understand that there must be several criminals and other people on U.S.
[00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:26.567]  databanks.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.142]  Especially with the DHS putting toddlers on the no-fly list.
[00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:44.633]  But if you have a suspect who the Russian government warned you about, attended CIA-backed workshops that the DHS was briefed on, and the FBI interviewed, why does the FBI need public assistance identifying the suspect?
[00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:51.307]  Not to mention how the feds reportedly called the Tsarnaev brothers after the bombing and before any other incidents.
[00:04:51.788 --> 00:04:58.452]  Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbors, co-workers, or family members of the suspects.
[00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:04.937]  Though it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us.
[00:05:05.457 --> 00:05:08.339]  Did you ask any of your co-workers they're agents?
[00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:16.032]  Aside from Stonewalling Info Wars reporter Dan Badondi, Goon's got in his face for dare asking real questions.
[00:05:16.612 --> 00:05:19.774]  Let's talk about those photos.
[00:05:35.824 --> 00:05:36.705]  Next question please.
[00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:44.212]  Jihar's white or gray backpack with the black stripes is clearly not the black backpack with the white or gray stripes that exploded.
[00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:47.074]  In fact, the bags are the exact opposite.
[00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:52.439]  The only official photos that should be officially relied upon in this investigation are those you see before you today.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.903]  So what's the possible explanation for these bizarro backpacks?
[00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:57.298]  There's one theory.
[00:05:57.478 --> 00:06:04.525]  Doubt of the official story could have easily been squashed by releasing footage of the bomb being placed.
[00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:08.949]  Footage that even Governor Deval Patrick hasn't seen.
[00:06:19.192 --> 00:06:22.193]  Well, the videotape is not something I've seen.
[00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:23.414]  It's been described to me.
[00:06:24.314 --> 00:06:36.139]  But it does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down.
[00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:39.245]  And that brings up another piece of questionable footage.
[00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:40.965]  Who was the naked man?
[00:06:41.406 --> 00:06:49.348]  InfoWars reporter David Knight contacted Merit Tsarnaev, the aunt of the suspects, who identified the stripped man as her nephew Tamerlan.
[00:06:50.228 --> 00:06:50.528]  Hello.
[00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:52.829]  Hello, is this Merit Tsarnaev?
[00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:54.750]  Yes, speaking.
[00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.810]  Hi, my name is David Knight.
[00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.411]  I'm with InfoWars.com.
[00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.671]  It's Alex Jones' operation.
[00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.592]  Have you heard of us?
[00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:02.472]  Yes, I have heard of you.
[00:07:02.532 --> 00:07:04.313]  And we would very much like to do an interview with you.
[00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:05.053]  Would that be possible?
[00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:20.625]  Since I've seen the material that you presented for the public before, about the United States bombing, even before the names of our boys were put out there, I was following you from the very beginning.
[00:07:21.926 --> 00:07:31.814]  I don't know, I have trust in that information, I have trust in you, and I would like, I would like to have my word said.
[00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:33.256]  Good, good.
[00:07:33.316 --> 00:07:34.697]  Especially in the part when
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.546]  The guy that was taken into custody by police and given over to the FBI?
[00:07:45.567 --> 00:07:46.828]  You know who I'm talking about?
[00:07:46.848 --> 00:07:46.908]  Yes.
[00:07:46.968 --> 00:07:49.370]  The naked guy?
[00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.930]  Yes.
[00:07:50.070 --> 00:08:01.779]  I have to publicly state that I confirm and identify this person as my nephew, Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.503]  Moretz's revelation has been widely ignored by the media.
[00:08:05.763 --> 00:08:12.228]  The outlets that did pick up the naked man's arrest quickly wrote him off as somebody who was not really a suspect in the first place.
[00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:20.975]  Before we go any further, let's talk about what the brothers allegedly did after the bombing, aside from reportedly talking to the FBI as we mentioned earlier.
[00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:23.918]  The story goes that the two had a seemingly normal life.
[00:08:24.278 --> 00:08:28.762]  Jahar went back to school, but after being named suspects, the brothers went on the run.
[00:08:29.184 --> 00:08:30.064]  So where did this story come from?
[00:08:30.084 --> 00:08:31.885]  It's a theory that the brothers wanted a gun,
[00:08:51.454 --> 00:08:52.154]  We're good to go!
[00:09:08.817 --> 00:09:10.558]  But what about the carjacking victim?
[00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:12.338]  Didn't the brothers confess to him?
[00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:15.760]  Well, there are conflicting narratives concerning that too.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.362]  Briefly, the carjacking victim known as Danny reported a movie-like escape from the Tsarnaev brothers.
[00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:28.165]  But before he got away, Danny says Tamerlan confessed to killing the MIT officer as well as a role in the bombing.
[00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:34.927]  Contrast that with an earlier interview where Danny says Tamerlan mentioned the bombing but said nothing of the MIT shooting.
[00:09:35.287 --> 00:09:36.888]  Draw your own conclusion there.
[00:09:37.595 --> 00:09:41.757]  Oh, and the 7-11 robbery that took place, that wasn't the Tsarnaev brothers.
[00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:50.620]  When the government and the shadow government has been gearing up to roll out and be our savior, and they stand to gain from it, it's obvious.
[00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:56.683]  Whoever the suspect is, the government will appropriate it and create a narrative.
[00:09:57.752 --> 00:10:08.101]  And 90% of it probably, I'm just guessing, will be a fabrication to shape our thought of police and military and safety.
[00:10:08.321 --> 00:10:10.102]  And they're licking their chops.
[00:10:10.302 --> 00:10:13.885]  They're now saying, were there right-wing or patriot meetings in the area?
[00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:14.926]  Uh-oh.
[00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:15.587]  Uh-oh.
[00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:16.427]  Oh, man.
[00:10:16.527 --> 00:10:17.688]  And that's CNN doing that?
[00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:19.089]  Oh.
[00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.551]  Wolf Blitzer, we are in trouble.
[00:10:21.712 --> 00:10:22.252]  Oh, man.
[00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:24.674]  I bet they even dragged me into it with my 1776 line.
[00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:37.772]  That was footage from the quote shootout between the Tsarnaev brothers and the police.
[00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:50.671]  This is one of the most contradictory moments following the bombing, with various witnesses contesting whether or not the suspects tossed bombs at the police, whether or not an officer was injured by friendly fire, and whether or not Jahar ran over Tamerlan.
[00:10:51.051 --> 00:11:01.396]  If the naked man is Tamerlan Zarnaev, as his aunt claims, then the official story has much to explain as to how a bullet-wounded man was struck by a car and appears virtually uninjured.
[00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:07.358]  Regardless of what happened, after the confrontation with the police, Jahar is able to go and hide himself in a boat
[00:11:07.665 --> 00:11:08.046]  I'm good.
[00:11:18.743 --> 00:11:23.106]  Door-to-door armed searches without warrant.
[00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:31.933]  Police don't need warrants if property owners welcome them into their homes.
[00:11:32.814 --> 00:11:40.480]  Families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched without probable cause.
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.724]  No guns were pointed at any families.
[00:11:46.044 --> 00:11:49.662]  Let's watch that clip again covered by footage of what actually happened.
[00:11:51.047 --> 00:11:55.409]  Door-to-door armed searches without warrant.
[00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:04.214]  Police don't need warrants if property owners welcome them into their homes.
[00:12:05.115 --> 00:12:12.779]  Families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched without probable cause.
[00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:18.002]  No guns were pointed at any families.
[00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:18.963]  We're good to go!
[00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:41.804]  But doesn't yet seem to have the wound in his mouth that would be reported later.
[00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:49.311]  If he indeed shot himself through the mouth, I doubt he'd be this mobile and it's a pretty safe bet that he'd be suffering much heavier blood loss.
[00:12:49.771 --> 00:12:52.293]  Jahar is currently in custody awaiting trial.
[00:12:52.534 --> 00:12:54.595]  His brother Tamerlan is now deceased.
[00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:59.720]  But even with one suspect dead and another in jail, the story didn't end there.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.821]  An acquaintance of Tamerlan was killed during an FBI interrogation.
[00:13:04.281 --> 00:13:08.763]  The FBI's story changed multiple times as to how their agent felt his life was in danger.
[00:13:09.263 --> 00:13:18.026]  Whether it was Todashev's martial arts skills or a potential weapon in his hands, the FBI agent shot Todashev execution-style, according to Todashev's father.
[00:13:18.046 --> 00:13:21.347]  Info Wars talked to Todashev's widow about the killing.
[00:13:21.758 --> 00:13:21.938]  Yeah.
[00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:52.939]  Don't be quiet.
[00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.120]  Just say what happened to me, if anything happens.
[00:13:55.521 --> 00:13:56.221]  He wasn't scared.
[00:13:56.862 --> 00:13:59.784]  If he would, he probably would not even speak with them in the first place.
[00:14:00.164 --> 00:14:04.447]  But since he was invited to our home, that means he wasn't scared of them.
[00:14:07.654 --> 00:14:09.415]  They have interviewed him.
[00:14:09.655 --> 00:14:12.297]  He would not respond to his cell phone or anything.
[00:14:12.877 --> 00:14:17.759]  They have his friend waiting for him outside, but suddenly they let him go after four hours.
[00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:22.302]  Some of the agents were still with Ibrahim.
[00:14:22.822 --> 00:14:33.248]  And right now they've been pulling so many statements that he was armed and he was unarmed and that his body was a weapon since he's an MMA fighter.
[00:14:33.988 --> 00:14:41.392]  But he just had his knee surgery back in March, so he wasn't able to move pretty quick, pretty fast or do anything.
[00:14:42.232 --> 00:14:48.336]  And after we actually, after all that happened, when we were able to enter the house,
[00:14:49.696 --> 00:14:50.957]  He had seven shots.
[00:14:51.337 --> 00:14:52.678]  One was in the back of the head.
[00:14:53.378 --> 00:14:58.441]  And it has nothing to do with him start attacking them as they said.
[00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:02.423]  They're coming with the knife, with the blade, with the broom, with the swords.
[00:15:03.643 --> 00:15:06.625]  I think they came with the five different statements.
[00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:09.834]  Yeah, for those who don't know, it's important you say that.
[00:15:10.095 --> 00:15:13.198]  They've now admitted that he didn't have a weapon, didn't attack him.
[00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:24.589]  So as the runners take to the streets once again, let us not forget all of the lies, half-truths, disinformation, and teleprompter reading that has hindered justice for all of the victims of April 15, 2013.
[00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:26.511]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:30.689 --> 00:15:48.642]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube... well, he has 300 million people that have watched him on YouTube, and that sort of fringe, arch-conservative, deeply, I think, racist strain is being tapped into at crazy profit by people in the media.
[00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:52.625]  Well, it is, and I think that the point you just made is the key thing, at crazy profit.
[00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:54.447]  These folks are getting paid to be racist.
[00:15:54.747 --> 00:16:00.851]  If they'd kill the president and hundreds of people that knew about it, would they kill some people in a marathon to get their agenda through?
[00:16:01.131 --> 00:16:08.736]  If they'd bomb Vietnam, South Vietnam, to blame it on the communists, again, who I'm no fan of either, they did stuff like that as well, would they do it in America?
[00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:15.661]  If they ran Operation Gladio in Europe to blame it on liberal and conservative groups that got too powerful that weren't globalist, would they do it here?
[00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:17.222]  Is this Operation Gladio Part 2?
[00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:25.958]  The facts are in.
[00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:27.258]  The studies are legion.
[00:16:27.558 --> 00:16:34.903]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
