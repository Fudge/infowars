[00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:16.461]  We have our own government with rogue agencies openly in major elite publications like Atlantic Monthly and Foreign Affairs calling for the execution or murderous overthrow of President Trump.
[00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:23.744]  History is happening right now, so more happens in a day than what happened in a month 50 years ago.
[00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:44.095]  Now Roger Stone, who I met six, seven years ago at a JFK event, and four or five years ago again at another one, best-selling author on that subject, been inside with four or five administrations, been involved in more elections than that, former head of the Trump campaign in 2015, and of course previously got Trump to run briefly in 2000.
[00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:49.439]  He is openly being called, but they won't say when, before the Senate.
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.822]  They keep saying they're going to do it, but then always backing off.
[00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:59.653]  They've got libel suits against him as if the gates of hell have opened up to go after Roger Stone.
[00:01:01.953 --> 00:01:04.374]  And the question is, why is that happening?
[00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:06.254]  Well, it's because he's over the target.
[00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:10.055]  The old World War II saying, both my grandfathers were in World War II in the Army Air Corps.
[00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:12.975]  One was a fighter pilot and the other was a B-17 pilot.
[00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:14.696]  He flew Liberators before that.
[00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:15.736]  They called them flying coffins.
[00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:20.977]  And the joke was that when you're over the target, you're getting the flack.
[00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.576]  They didn't have radar back then.
[00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:24.677]  They didn't even have GPS.
[00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:25.919]  They didn't have any of that type of stuff.
[00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.100]  They just had basic maps.
[00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:29.302]  And they'd say, OK, we're flying out of North Africa.
[00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:33.267]  We're going to go bomb parts of Italy we're about to invade on the coast.
[00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:35.449]  That says it's 600 miles away.
[00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.653]  We'll just try to dead reckon with our watches and everything else and bomb the spot.
[00:01:39.673 --> 00:01:40.434]  But they could never do that.
[00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:42.456]  But the Germans had anti-aircraft.
[00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:48.761]  Firing these big shells up in the sky that would explode and then drift, shrapnel in the air, called flak.
[00:01:49.322 --> 00:01:56.628]  And so the big joke was, the leader of the squadron would turn the aircraft into the flak.
[00:01:57.788 --> 00:02:02.489]  And so that's how we direct ourselves is by where the flat comes in.
[00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:11.091]  So Roger Stone joins us right now, obviously about Republican senators coming out saying they want to go after Trump for Russia.
[00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:13.432]  As they've been proven, there's no evidence.
[00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:15.352]  As they've been proven, they were spying on the president.
[00:02:15.892 --> 00:02:17.753]  Everything seems to be proving us right.
[00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:22.618]  But now John McCain comes out two weeks ago and says Rand Paul is a Russian agent.
[00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:23.539]  No proof.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.525]  He's the one that had war in Montenegro with NATO invading areas of Russia, basically the Russian border.
[00:02:30.647 --> 00:02:31.828]  Stone is a Russian agent.
[00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.192]  In Infowars, according to Congressional
[00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.229]  We're good to go.
[00:02:56.567 --> 00:03:03.891]  Now they're saying Nunes must be a Russian agent because he exposed the fact they're illegally spying and there's no evidence once they get the evidence.
[00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:05.993]  So on every front, Roger Stone joins us.
[00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:07.373]  We'll do 45 minutes live here.
[00:03:07.393 --> 00:03:09.515]  Maybe even on Twitter, Real Alex Jones.
[00:03:09.535 --> 00:03:10.635]  We'll take some questions.
[00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:11.616]  We'll put those up on screen.
[00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:18.020]  So tweet your questions at Real Alex Jones and respond to my last tweet where I pointed out to folks that we're live.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.741]  I didn't do the tweet myself.
[00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:20.601]  I said, hey, please tweet.
[00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.583]  20 minutes ago, I'm about to go live at Real Alex Jones.
[00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.845]  So maybe we should punch that up and see of our skeleton crew.
[00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:31.468]  Because we got three great guys in here tonight that are doing this live show.
[00:03:31.488 --> 00:03:33.810]  I mean, I have a limited crew to even do two or three shows live a day.
[00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.751]  They're working 18 hours to bring you this.
[00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:36.631]  And I'm not pitching.
[00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:42.515]  I'm just saying this is like the rebels in Star Wars fighting the Star Destroyers with the X-Wings.
[00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:43.756]  So it's happening now.
[00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:46.798]  You got a live Democrat battle plan to take down Trump leaked.
[00:03:47.964 --> 00:03:48.505]  There it is.
[00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:50.687]  The great crew did put that out as I asked.
[00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:51.688]  I guess I said 20 minutes ago.
[00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:52.629]  It was like 40 minutes ago.
[00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.052]  And so, that's when I got to the office.
[00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:59.276]  So please tweet your questions at that in the comment section.
[00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:02.279]  They'll print it off for me because the monitor is too far away for me to read it.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.461]  And I will go over all of that.
[00:04:06.203 --> 00:04:07.425]  Let's read that first question right there.
[00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:08.706]  Let's go ahead and read it.
[00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:09.407]  I'll go to Roger Stone.
[00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.992]  Is it true you apologized for pushing the Pizzagate story because you were under threat of a lawsuit?
[00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:17.834]  You knew it was hashtag fake news.
[00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:18.174]  Okay.
[00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:19.455]  No.
[00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:26.520]  Massive organized networks engaging in crime against children through the UN and other groups is documented.
[00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:32.491]  The media focused on people looking at 4chan and Reddit on a pizza place.
[00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.852]  We covered it some but didn't find evidence.
[00:04:35.173 --> 00:04:36.993]  The media made us the scapegoat for it.
[00:04:37.294 --> 00:04:46.398]  So before I ever got threatened by Aliphonis with a lawsuit a month ago or any of those, I pulled our articles that had reported on news that some of it was proven to be fake because I have credibility.
[00:04:48.123 --> 00:05:11.236]  And now the media has made this big thing that I admit I'm fake news because I'm credible and when there's not a basement in the place or other things like that, I don't think there's any evidence Olifantis, you know, this guy that's been sucked in because he is a little guy, MSN picked him to try to then say, oh look, Podesta's emails don't show anything, separate New York.
[00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:12.356]  Look at this poor guy.
[00:05:12.376 --> 00:05:14.217]  Everybody gangs up on this.
[00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:18.501]  And then the media can have their costs elapsed.
[00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:21.384]  That's what I've been saying since December 1st.
[00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:23.286]  We have internal memos here at the office.
[00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:24.748]  I said, this is a honeypot.
[00:05:25.068 --> 00:05:25.689]  It's a setup.
[00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:26.149]  Drop it.
[00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.531]  We have all this real stuff.
[00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:32.436]  We have the NYPD telling us through our sources that Wiener's going to be indicted for child porn.
[00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:33.537]  Months later, that's in the news.
[00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:37.861]  So that's Wiener, Podesta, Wiener, they should all be investigated.
[00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:39.383]  Hillary Clinton, all of them.
[00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:41.645]  Jerry Epstein, convicted pedophile, Bill Clinton involved.
[00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:43.426]  That's going on.
[00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:44.787]  That's what my sources said.
[00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:54.856]  And then for four or five days it got away from us here that the media distracted off of this and now they're on all over CNN everywhere going, oh my God, Alex Jones is going to be destroyed.
[00:05:57.478 --> 00:06:02.879]  Clarify that out of some... In fact, a lot of people say, or just belligerently say, you believe it all.
[00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.560]  No, I clarified it because I have credibility.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.601]  So you can watch my full statement, Alex Jones responds to the peacekeeping controversy, but there's your answer.
[00:06:10.961 --> 00:06:21.703]  But listen, we know that 500,000 children died when Bill Clinton was in office, under intensified sanctions after the Iraq War, five times worse than George Herbert Walker Bush, who was a horrible demon.
[00:06:24.448 --> 00:06:25.609]  And he's like walking dead today.
[00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.255]  We know they funded Libya and Syria takeovers that killed hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[00:06:31.595 --> 00:06:33.637]  That's all confirmed, but nobody cares about that.
[00:06:34.318 --> 00:06:43.527]  Now that Trump is ending some of the Al-Qaeda, ISIS, slash Wahhabist Al-Nusra operations, the media reports civilian deaths, because they want to demonize Trump.
[00:06:43.547 --> 00:06:45.909]  But Trump's cleaning up what Obama and Hillary started.
[00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:48.130]  That's
[00:07:06.897 --> 00:07:09.179]  His currency is that he's really accurate.
[00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.000]  When Trump was up in the polls, he would say it.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.301]  When he was down in the polls, he would say it.
[00:07:12.942 --> 00:07:16.744]  When something really went on, I would say, hey, Roger, let's try to put a good face on this.
[00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:18.946]  He's like, no, I'm going to put the worst face on it.
[00:07:19.847 --> 00:07:20.988]  And I wasn't trying to put a good face.
[00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:21.928]  I thought things were good.
[00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:23.289]  He would go negative, quite frankly.
[00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.471]  So they say he's a dirty trickster.
[00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.712]  He's the father of lies.
[00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:27.513]  You know, he's the devil.
[00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:32.847]  He's the guy that got Richard Nixon to go meet Donald Trump.
[00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.348]  He's the guy that thought Donald Trump would be president.
[00:07:34.668 --> 00:07:36.129]  He's the guy that got him to meet Reagan.
[00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:43.154]  They know that he has, like Matt Drudge, who has the same quality, been able to pick talent off a long way.
[00:07:43.174 --> 00:07:45.796]  And then that's the essence of genius, isn't it?
[00:07:46.296 --> 00:07:51.600]  Like, I picked Paul Watson and many others from Operation from nowhere and look bigger than I am in some respects.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.020]  That's great.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.922]  Hope Paul gets 50 times bigger than I am.
[00:07:54.938 --> 00:08:05.421]  The problem is, and the good thing is, Paul mainly hits the youth, which is the great group we want to get, but then in this current war, I get the intelligence agencies, the military, and the killers listen to me, but then the kids listen to him.
[00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:12.704]  Look, Jack Spratt could eat no fat, and his wife could eat no lean, so between the two, they like to platter clean.
[00:08:13.464 --> 00:08:17.185]  Different strokes for different folks, all walks of life.
[00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.986]  Another question, I got to go to Roger here, because he's waiting.
[00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:41.725]  Well, that's because the New York Times just leaked, using national security data, the fact that Flynn's appointee under him, the guy that he brought in, was the guy that was formerly in these agencies that knew what was happening.
[00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:52.150]  So yeah, Flynn was brought in, he was asked to do this, and he was a patriot who helped fight Al Qaeda, helped expose the whole thing, and then now the New York Times leaks again.
[00:08:52.250 --> 00:09:01.552]  Okay, we were spying, but we're not going to go after Trump for Russian connections, because there are none, other than setting up phone calls, you know, the regular calls, once he's president-elect.
[00:09:02.353 --> 00:09:07.034]  But, oh my god, Flynn and his people advised the president on national security.
[00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:09.515]  If you can't advise the president on, it's like,
[00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.431]  Trey Gowdy said three days ago on Monday, or was it?
[00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:15.831]  Yeah, I guess it was Tuesday.
[00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:35.817]  He said if Chairman Devin Nunes of the arm of the state of the, I'm teleprompting for free, of the House Intelligence Committee cannot brief the president, then no one can.
[00:09:36.418 --> 00:09:38.618]  See, now it's just we can't talk to Russians, okay.
[00:09:38.938 --> 00:09:40.619]  Well, now we can't talk to the president.
[00:09:41.656 --> 00:09:46.481]  And then the president can't talk to me, and he can't talk to Roger Stone, because we're all Russian agents.
[00:09:49.725 --> 00:09:52.708]  I'm not even going to sit here and defend it.
[00:09:52.748 --> 00:09:58.695]  It's like if they say, you're anti-Korean, you don't like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, who feeds on his own people.
[00:09:58.775 --> 00:10:03.340]  My sister is South Korean adopted at three months old, starving to death.
[00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:28.929]  Because if a girl comes from out of wedlock family there seem a subhuman in South Korea I'm not against Koreans that as a good family we saved her and she's a wonderful smart person and a part of our family since I was 14 years old I'm 43 now and she works here and does a great job but they say oh he's anti-korean he's against Kim Jong-un or Kim Jong-il and I'm not going to sit here and you know tell you that
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:39.484]  Most of the adult men, I guess I will, fought in the US military and were involved in clandestine operations against the Russians in Latin America and in Europe.
[00:10:40.984 --> 00:10:45.546]  But I can't get into all of it because I was never told about it all, and it's classified.
[00:10:45.586 --> 00:10:51.589]  But the point is, it's so insulting when they know that I'm as Americana as it comes.
[00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:52.129]  Look what I do.
[00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:54.816]  And then they say I'm a Russian agent.
[00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:59.040]  Roger Stone in the 80s helped roll up a Russian spy network, alerted the FBI to it.
[00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:00.942]  We don't have to go re-defend all that.
[00:11:01.303 --> 00:11:06.408]  It's a diversion off the fact that Podesta and all them are basically communist Chinese Muppets.
[00:11:06.888 --> 00:11:09.371]  The Russians, I don't blame them wanting to have influence, they were involved too.
[00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:11.993]  Russia got devastated.
[00:11:12.013 --> 00:11:15.717]  Their main export every year for hundreds of millions of dollars to Europe and to Asia is gas.
[00:11:16.738 --> 00:11:22.004]  What do you think happened when he brought coal back that our whole gas supply can't be sold here?
[00:11:22.365 --> 00:11:27.971]  It's now being loaded on giant Exxon Mobil and other giant gas tankers that are even bigger than old tankers and shipped to Europe.
[00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:29.332]  We just cut the Russians out.
[00:11:29.392 --> 00:11:31.014]  No, no, no, no harm.
[00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:34.658]  But Russia, it is America first and Russia actually respects that.
[00:11:35.438 --> 00:11:36.379]  We're not to get you, Russia.
[00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.580]  Just, sorry, we're so much more badass than you.
[00:11:39.101 --> 00:11:40.122]  So, that's the truth.
[00:11:40.422 --> 00:11:42.543]  Hillary and others sold us out, so the next 45 minutes we're going live.
[00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.925]  Appreciate Roger Stone holding for 20 minutes, we had some technical difficulties.
[00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:48.048]  We've got him online now, via video, Skype, and audio.
[00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.470]  I've set the table here, but they're in the news saying, kill Trump.
[00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:53.852]  COG, shadow government to overthrow him.
[00:11:54.072 --> 00:11:58.135]  They've gone from denying it, Roger Stone, to Atlantic Monthly saying, let's overthrow him.
[00:11:58.536 --> 00:12:01.178]  I don't think we can underestimate just how serious this is.
[00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:06.358]  No, Alex, it has been really an extraordinary day.
[00:12:06.378 --> 00:12:14.204]  I am unbowed, unbroken, and I vow to fight onward despite the personal attacks on me today.
[00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:30.278]  Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, yet again, repeated the falsehood that I had advance knowledge of the hacking of John Podesta's email.
[00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:33.806]  I have never said anything of the kind.
[00:12:34.686 --> 00:12:35.807]  It's supposition.
[00:12:35.907 --> 00:12:37.107]  It's conjecture.
[00:12:37.207 --> 00:12:38.808]  It's a projection.
[00:12:39.448 --> 00:12:58.535]  I did say that his time in the barrel would come, meaning there would be scrutiny on his Russian business activities, and indeed, they would end up on page one of the Wall Street Journal and dozens of other outlets, including InfoWars, Daily Caller, and others.
[00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:15.481]  I also had to face down a seven year old harassment lawsuit from a crackpot, who I now believe is propped up by the Clintons, regarding a gubernatorial campaign that I assisted.
[00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:23.908]  And named in me in this bogus suit is Carl Palladino, the Trump New York State Chairman.
[00:13:24.565 --> 00:13:27.046]  Um, there is no evidence whatsoever.
[00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:36.749]  Reminds me kind of the, of the entire Russia, uh, gate, uh, strategy, or I should say scandal, which is a scandal without evidence.
[00:13:36.989 --> 00:13:42.771]  Now, tonight, we hear that General Flynn has agreed to testify for immunity.
[00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:46.452]  And we've now learned that that is entirely false.
[00:13:47.132 --> 00:13:50.553]  Uh, that, and that General Flynn's attorney has denied it.
[00:13:51.648 --> 00:13:56.330]  So it's the same thing where they said Napolitano was fired when he was on spring break vacation.
[00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.991]  It's total war.
[00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:00.472]  They just put out total disinfo constantly.
[00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:02.333]  It's fake news.
[00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:04.534]  It is, as we say, fake news.
[00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:12.658]  Watching Congressman Schiff and Tucker Carlson, in which he accuses Carlson of being an agent for the Kremlin.
[00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.119]  The idea that John McCain
[00:14:15.805 --> 00:14:23.190]  Would accuse Senator Rand Paul of working for Putin, which by the way, I think is a violation of Senate rules.
[00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.632]  I don't think you can disparage another member.
[00:14:26.672 --> 00:14:29.234]  I think it is specifically against the rules.
[00:14:29.514 --> 00:14:33.036]  I wonder why Senator McCain has not been censured.
[00:14:33.377 --> 00:14:39.641]  Senator McCain has attacked me saying, I need to explain my ties to Russia and Yanukovych.
[00:14:40.237 --> 00:14:42.619]  That would be a very short conversation, Senator.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:43.740]  I have none.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:58.813]  Well, I was about to say, the Democrats, if anyone who knows history, but you go back to Nixon, who of course was the Vice President to Eisenhower and the whole Un-American Activities Committee, the Democrats are the ones that have been up the rear end of the Russians or vice versa.
[00:14:59.293 --> 00:15:07.180]  So the claim that you and I and Trump are on some type of Russian mammary gland is just ridiculous.
[00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:11.257]  Yeah, no, it's insulting and I guess it is meant to be.
[00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:14.499]  My start in politics is as an anti-communist.
[00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:17.860]  I hate totalitarianism of any stripe.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.781]  The system in Russia is a rotten system.
[00:15:21.182 --> 00:15:33.247]  So why do we have to sit here when they said they were spying on us, then they weren't spying on us, now they never said that they were spying on us, and these new Republican senators coming out, oh we have damning stuff, let's have an investigation.
[00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:35.728]  What the hell is going on?
[00:15:35.768 --> 00:16:01.040]  I mean, I wish the Russians wanted us to secure our borders, defeat Al-Qaeda and ISIS, cut taxes, empower the middle class, have the best small business start-up numbers since 1984, peak of the Reagan recovery, best consumer confidence in 16 years, $300 billion in new small job investment, $3 trillion plus in the stock market, and I watch the Democrats, Roger, openly, I've never seen this in 22 years of being politically active, but 30 years involved,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:08.543]  Seeing them openly say, we're trying to kill the economy to stop Trump, and we're trying to kill the British economy to stop Brexit.
[00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:10.684]  It's like, these are the enemies.
[00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.344]  I mean, what the hell?
[00:16:12.585 --> 00:16:27.130]  Then the Communist Chinese come in with Juncker, the most famous Nazi family after Hitler, who run Luxembourg and are tax-exempt, saying they'll break America up and plunge our stock market if we don't roll over to Juncker?
[00:16:27.511 --> 00:16:28.651]  What the hell?
[00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.652]  What the hell is that?
[00:16:31.846 --> 00:16:32.627]  No, it's unbelievable.
[00:16:32.647 --> 00:16:37.535]  And what we're hearing from the Democrats, both in the House and Senate, is red-baiting, fear-mongering,
[00:16:40.285 --> 00:16:52.475]  You know, it is well beyond the point of recklessness, whether it is Adam Schiff who has maligned me, or whether it is Senator Mark Warner, or whether it is Senator John McCain.
[00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:54.016]  But let me tell you something, Alex.
[00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.858]  These guys are pussies.
[00:16:56.358 --> 00:16:57.619]  They talk a tough game.
[00:16:57.679 --> 00:17:00.721]  We're gonna get Roger Stone in front of the committee.
[00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:03.364]  Gentlemen, ladies, I am ready.
[00:17:03.644 --> 00:17:05.385]  I am more than ready.
[00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:06.386]  Let me say this right now.
[00:17:06.466 --> 00:17:08.508]  Let me tell... I'm not against gay people.
[00:17:09.286 --> 00:17:10.666]  Okay, I love them, they're great folks.
[00:17:11.247 --> 00:17:25.391]  But Schiff looks like the archetypal cocksucker with those little deer-in-the-headlight eyes and all his stuff, and there's something about this fairy hopping around, bossing everybody around, trying to intimidate people like me and you.
[00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:34.793]  I want to tell Congressman Schiff and all the rest of them, hey, listen, asshole, quit saying Roger and I, and I've never used cussing in 22 years, but the gloves are off.
[00:17:35.113 --> 00:17:36.294]  Listen, you son of a bitch!
[00:17:37.054 --> 00:17:38.476]  What the fuck's your problem?
[00:17:38.816 --> 00:17:41.900]  You wanna sit here and say that I'm a goddamn fuckin' Russian?
[00:17:42.341 --> 00:17:45.385]  You get in my face with that, I'll beat your goddamn ass, you son of a bitch!
[00:17:45.885 --> 00:17:46.747]  You piece of shit!
[00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:48.749]  You fuckin' goddamn fucker!
[00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.131]  Listen, fuckhead!
[00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:51.933]  You have fuckin' crossed the line!
[00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:54.636]  Get that through your goddamn fucking head!
[00:17:55.277 --> 00:17:56.418]  Stop pushing your shit!
[00:17:56.718 --> 00:18:00.903]  You're the people that have fucked this country over and gang-raped the shit out of it and lost an election.
[00:18:01.123 --> 00:18:03.726]  So stop shooting your mouth off, claiming I'm the enemy.
[00:18:03.946 --> 00:18:05.748]  You got that, you goddamn son of a bitch?
[00:18:06.008 --> 00:18:06.669]  Feel your hand.
[00:18:06.709 --> 00:18:07.750]  I'm sorry, but I'm done.
[00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.033]  You start calling me a foreign agent, those are fucking fighting words.
[00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:11.494]  Excuse me.
[00:18:12.586 --> 00:18:18.714]  Yeah, I don't think I have ever been in a campaign in which we disparage the patriotism of our opponents.
[00:18:18.774 --> 00:18:26.324]  Now, I'm not going to go there, but I think Adam Schiff has acted irresponsibly, and I think he needs to be confronted.
[00:18:26.384 --> 00:18:28.227]  He's sucking Globo's dick!
[00:18:29.619 --> 00:18:30.579]  Well, what did he say?
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.800]  You just saw the clip.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.121]  Roger Stone has been in direct contact with Julian Assange.
[00:18:35.582 --> 00:18:36.582]  I have never said that.
[00:18:37.022 --> 00:18:38.363]  No one has ever said that.
[00:18:38.803 --> 00:18:39.704]  It is not true.
[00:18:40.104 --> 00:18:41.704]  There is no evidence of it.
[00:18:42.025 --> 00:18:44.986]  I've been very clear about who my source was.
[00:18:45.326 --> 00:18:48.227]  Don't blame me if my source is better than the mainstream media.
[00:18:48.547 --> 00:18:58.032]  Don't blame me if I was right about the fact that Julian Assange had a payload of information that he dropped in October, as I predicted on this program.
[00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:00.352]  See, that's the real problem here.
[00:19:00.933 --> 00:19:03.054]  This is two and two equals six.
[00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:10.179]  The worst kind of demagoguery from the shifts and the spires questioning our patriotism.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.622]  If you want to question our philosophy, that's fine.
[00:19:13.942 --> 00:19:17.125]  If you want to question our partisanship, that's fine.
[00:19:17.345 --> 00:19:22.789]  But when you start to question our loyalty to the United States, that does cross a line.
[00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:30.066]  Well, that's the reason, you know, I actually get a little bit profane with these guys is to demarcate the line.
[00:19:30.567 --> 00:19:37.956]  I love it when they take the radical stuff I say and put it in their White House or Obama-run media matters or stuff.
[00:19:38.297 --> 00:19:40.499]  I want them to know the games are over, man.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.181]  You want to kill the president?
[00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:46.323]  They're openly over the news saying overthrow him using continuity of government.
[00:19:46.803 --> 00:19:48.404]  They openly say they want to put us all in prison.
[00:19:48.464 --> 00:19:50.084]  I want them to get through their little heads.
[00:19:50.464 --> 00:19:51.485]  We're not intimidated.
[00:19:51.545 --> 00:19:55.806]  We're intimidated by what we might do to you, you little assholes.
[00:19:56.386 --> 00:19:58.267]  So that's why I don't normally use French.
[00:19:59.227 --> 00:20:01.388]  I love French cuisine, the French language, beautiful country.
[00:20:01.988 --> 00:20:04.549]  But the whole point is I'm demarcating to them
[00:20:06.087 --> 00:20:10.188]  They keep trying to illustrate and act like they're in authority and they're in power.
[00:20:10.248 --> 00:20:10.789]  You're not.
[00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:12.169]  So let me ask you this, Roger.
[00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:21.092]  What do you make of their intimidation, their attempts to shut down the free press, their attempts to shut us up, their arrogance?
[00:20:21.232 --> 00:20:22.313]  I mean, is it mental illness?
[00:20:22.733 --> 00:20:28.715]  Hell, half the Democratic Congress people think that the islands float or don't know that President Bush hadn't been in office for eight plus years.
[00:20:29.115 --> 00:20:32.496]  I mean, we're seeing a bunch of mentally ill people, but they do have bravado.
[00:20:33.157 --> 00:20:33.877]  I mean, I'll say this.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:39.242]  Nancy Pelosi's got elephant balls compared to the average Republican up there.
[00:20:39.282 --> 00:20:44.665]  And these Republican senators attacking Trump and twinkle toes over their little blue eyes.
[00:20:45.305 --> 00:20:46.586]  You know, Paul Ryan.
[00:20:46.606 --> 00:20:51.949]  I mean, I'm so sick of these sellouts and these sycophants that are intimidated by MSM.
[00:20:52.129 --> 00:20:54.030]  I want MSM to demonize me.
[00:20:54.471 --> 00:20:57.332]  I want MSM to hate me because they're the plague.
[00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:58.553]  They're discredited.
[00:20:58.933 --> 00:21:02.975]  It's like Hitler in 1945 at his bunker saying, I'm a bad guy.
[00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:03.496]  Please!
[00:21:04.216 --> 00:21:04.777]  CNN!
[00:21:04.917 --> 00:21:05.658]  Say I'm bad!
[00:21:06.358 --> 00:21:07.559]  What's happening, Roger Stone?
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.403]  Well, and it's why their ratings are dropping.
[00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:25.256]  And despite the fact that they are, you know, screwing with their logarithms and blocking us on Facebook and screwing with us online, the Infowars of this world, the Daily Callers, the Breitbarts, we are on the move.
[00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:27.698]  We are gaining adherence every day.
[00:21:28.158 --> 00:21:29.820]  They have superior positioning,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:38.026]  But they are losing viewers because more and more Americans have figured out that CNN is fake news.
[00:21:38.106 --> 00:21:41.008]  That they will only allow one point of view.
[00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:45.451]  They allow John Podesta to disparage me personally.
[00:21:45.831 --> 00:21:46.291]  That's fine.
[00:21:46.352 --> 00:21:47.052]  I'm a big boy.
[00:21:47.132 --> 00:21:47.913]  I can handle him.
[00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:54.117]  But they do not give me the opportunity to respond.
[00:21:54.177 --> 00:21:56.819]  Now that's what real journalists do.
[00:21:57.259 --> 00:22:01.143]  That's what real news organizations do.
[00:22:01.303 --> 00:22:11.612]  By having this one-sided dialogue, CNN demonstrates that they are no longer, if they ever were, a true news organization.
[00:22:12.532 --> 00:22:15.355]  Look, this is very clear to me where we are headed.
[00:22:16.115 --> 00:22:17.357]  They have lost the White House.
[00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:19.098]  They have lost the House.
[00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:20.719]  They have lost the Senate.
[00:22:22.253 --> 00:22:39.378]  And now they are going to spend all their time in court because for eight years they have appointed left-wing judges who will overlook the law and seek to silence us, seek to allow them to disparage us without penalty.
[00:22:39.738 --> 00:22:41.859]  That is where I think we are headed.
[00:22:42.439 --> 00:22:43.079]  You have seen
[00:22:44.495 --> 00:22:51.979]  A federal judge now thwart the travel ban put forward courageously twice by Donald Trump.
[00:22:52.459 --> 00:22:54.840]  And liberal reporters asked me, well, aren't you disappointed?
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.821]  Isn't this a defeat?
[00:22:56.181 --> 00:22:59.282]  No, I'll be disappointed when he stops fighting for it.
[00:22:59.762 --> 00:23:07.186]  But I am not disappointed because he tries and fails because I know Donald Trump will try again.
[00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:09.427]  Not a quitter, a fighter.
[00:23:10.054 --> 00:23:11.476]  Not a quitter, fighter.
[00:23:11.917 --> 00:23:13.519]  I don't think they understand that yet.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.664]  They should know it from the campaign, but they don't.
[00:23:16.724 --> 00:23:19.028]  They think this was some kind of fluke.
[00:23:19.508 --> 00:23:19.989]  Well, really?
[00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:23.014]  They spent two billion dollars.
[00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:35.739]  They had the mainstream media essentially running round-the-clock anti-Trump TV commercials worth hundreds of millions, and they're screwing with our logarithms on Facebook, on Twitter, on Google.
[00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:38.741]  Oh, they've turned up the censorship.
[00:23:38.761 --> 00:23:42.744]  Zuckerberg, when Trump won, saying, how dare you not censor more, when the censorship was incredible.
[00:23:43.024 --> 00:23:46.807]  So now they've tripled it, even though it's killing ad revenue on Facebook and Google.
[00:23:47.047 --> 00:23:52.672]  They're losing hundreds of millions every month since they did this, but they don't care because they're totally committed.
[00:23:52.972 --> 00:23:57.635]  And again, I'm not a guy that uses profanity and I'm sorry if any kids were watching, this is internet only tonight.
[00:23:58.115 --> 00:24:13.965]  I'm demarcating though, putting marks down that when they start saying kill the president, Atlantic Monthly says let's have COG overthrow the president and say all Republicans elected in the last election are out of office and have an emergency government takeover, that's martial law.
[00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:14.986]  And then Rosie O'Donnell,
[00:24:15.806 --> 00:24:19.707]  And the usual suspects like Michael Moore are pushing it in pop culture.
[00:24:20.188 --> 00:24:21.968]  These are fighting words.
[00:24:22.448 --> 00:24:25.549]  And it's because Trump is so real, the elite are mad at him.
[00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:33.992]  And I don't get how so-called Democrats and Republican cowards in the establishment act like he's part of the establishment, when all he's trying to do is turn the economy back on.
[00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:35.573]  He's already delivered so much.
[00:24:35.873 --> 00:24:39.814]  Then they call the health care failure this big giant thing.
[00:24:39.834 --> 00:24:39.894]  And
[00:24:43.174 --> 00:24:44.755]  It's like the only thing he hasn't gotten done.
[00:24:44.795 --> 00:24:47.458]  It took Obama two plus years to pass what he wanted.
[00:24:47.798 --> 00:24:49.680]  In 60-something days, Trump doesn't get rid of it.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.802]  I mean, it's just such a historical moment.
[00:24:51.862 --> 00:24:54.484]  Folks, if Trump wasn't a good guy, I could care less about it.
[00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:58.127]  I could care less he calls me on the phone sometimes or calls Roger.
[00:24:58.488 --> 00:24:59.528]  That's not what this is about.
[00:25:00.009 --> 00:25:02.211]  It's that we're trying to restore our country.
[00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:03.892]  Multinationals are in control.
[00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:17.386]  Juncker, the literal number one Nazi family out of Prussia that back Hitler and own the defense companies, the war companies over there, is saying, America, we're going to take out Trump and overthrow you.
[00:25:17.707 --> 00:25:21.389]  And EU bureaucrats are laughing, saying your president will soon be dead.
[00:25:21.809 --> 00:25:23.270]  And I'm like, where are Americans?
[00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.893]  I get he's got big support, but God, this is like a joke, Roger.
[00:25:27.953 --> 00:25:30.715]  How, how pathetic this has gotten.
[00:25:30.735 --> 00:25:31.836]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:25:33.151 --> 00:25:37.714]  Well, the real question, Alex, is what happened to the old Democratic Party?
[00:25:38.075 --> 00:25:42.478]  The Democratic Party of, you know, Harry Truman and John Kennedy and Scoop Jackson.
[00:25:42.738 --> 00:25:44.440]  What happened to that Democratic Party?
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:59.371]  We now have a Democratic Party that will not stand up to Islamic terrorism, that has gone on this hysterical, red-baiting jag about Russia, when they ought to be more focused on China.
[00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:05.632]  Superior hackers stealing our technology every day, ripping us off.
[00:26:05.993 --> 00:26:10.476]  But no, we're focused on Russia because of some hysteria.
[00:26:10.496 --> 00:26:11.276]  Let's be clear.
[00:26:11.816 --> 00:26:18.381]  When Hillary and Barack Obama were in charge, Vladimir Putin rolled all over the United States.
[00:26:18.941 --> 00:26:21.123]  We didn't stop him in Crimea.
[00:26:21.383 --> 00:26:23.304]  We didn't get anything out of the reset.
[00:26:23.524 --> 00:26:25.906]  In fact, we sold him technology to kill us.
[00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:26.606]  Exactly.
[00:26:26.646 --> 00:26:27.647]  So let me ask you this question.
[00:26:30.217 --> 00:26:33.000]  Why do we have American elites that have gotten rich off our power?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.284]  Why do they have big, giant hard-ons against this country?
[00:26:38.965 --> 00:26:46.231]  Why do they hate America, that's where they live, and they worship North Korea, Venezuela, every other authoritarian system they
[00:26:47.492 --> 00:26:48.373]  What the hell?
[00:26:48.433 --> 00:26:49.534]  What is this fascination with evil?
[00:26:49.554 --> 00:26:50.895]  What is this fascination with
[00:27:09.673 --> 00:27:15.675]  Pissing over an American recovery and not seeing that the whole corrupt power elite is against Donald John Trump.
[00:27:16.015 --> 00:27:19.376]  I mean, how is it not crystal clear to everybody?
[00:27:20.757 --> 00:27:25.078]  Because they have run everything their way for 30 years.
[00:27:25.579 --> 00:27:34.302]  Because the Bushes and the Clintons and another Bush and Barack Obama have given us the same failed policies.
[00:27:34.982 --> 00:27:37.683]  And as you point out, Alex, the real problem is
[00:27:38.382 --> 00:27:45.088]  They and their cronies get exceedingly rich while the American people get poorer and poorer.
[00:27:45.468 --> 00:27:47.911]  And the party, sadly, doesn't matter.
[00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:52.855]  Now along comes Donald Trump and he hijacks their country club Republican party.
[00:27:53.336 --> 00:27:57.659]  And he returns it to its roots as a working people's party.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.223]  And these people are fashionable elites.
[00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:04.486]  Donald Trump is oh so unfashionable.
[00:28:05.366 --> 00:28:09.508]  It's disgusting, it makes you want to puke because it's snobbery.
[00:28:09.528 --> 00:28:17.150]  Sure, what do you make of them now saying having his daughter in the administration is like Saddam's family and it's scary, Chris Matthews?
[00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:23.272]  It's so shrill, it's comical, and it gets crazier by the day because they are losers.
[00:28:23.292 --> 00:28:26.213]  You know, we're optimists, but we also want to analyze the enemy.
[00:28:26.734 --> 00:28:30.335]  The Republican leadership, the Democrats, I mean Trump is surrounded, so are we, but they're surrounded by us.
[00:28:30.795 --> 00:28:33.456]  Don't they get any way they slice it, they're never getting out of this?
[00:28:34.966 --> 00:28:41.491]  No, in fact, the real question is, where was Chris Matthews when John Kennedy appointed his brother Attorney General?
[00:28:42.552 --> 00:28:47.295]  Did he, in his epic book on Kennedy and Nixon, did he criticize JFK?
[00:28:47.616 --> 00:28:54.201]  Talk about nepotism and all these other charges that have been hurled at Ivanka Trump.
[00:28:54.581 --> 00:28:56.923]  She is serving her country without pay.
[00:28:57.263 --> 00:28:58.544]  Well, she's gorgeous.
[00:28:58.624 --> 00:28:59.245]  She's smart.
[00:28:59.505 --> 00:29:01.526]  She's made $150 million on her own.
[00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:03.548]  Why the hell wouldn't Trump use that?
[00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:09.945]  Well, he trusts her, she's smart, she's loyal, she won't leak, and she's capable.
[00:29:10.405 --> 00:29:13.748]  She is a real role model for women today.
[00:29:13.928 --> 00:29:18.952]  And that's why they want her out, that's why they want Bannon out, they want anybody that's loyal to this country out.
[00:29:20.814 --> 00:29:23.016]  Well, and they're not going to get their way.
[00:29:23.036 --> 00:29:29.462]  I understand that Katie Walsh, who was the, I think, Deputy Chief of Staff, has left the White House staff.
[00:29:29.582 --> 00:29:31.384]  I think I heard that this afternoon.
[00:29:31.464 --> 00:29:33.967]  That is a step in the right direction.
[00:29:33.987 --> 00:29:34.747]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:29:34.807 --> 00:29:40.373]  Priebus, I know Priebus has been cozying up to you a little bit lately, but let's not get into that.
[00:29:41.173 --> 00:29:43.896]  But Priebus, his minion is out.
[00:29:43.916 --> 00:29:44.617]  So what's happening there?
[00:29:45.987 --> 00:29:49.431]  Well, it's not a good sign for Reince Priebus.
[00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:51.013]  Look, I support the president.
[00:29:51.053 --> 00:29:52.775]  He's got to make this decision.
[00:29:53.836 --> 00:30:01.324]  But it does concern me that some around him, some, do not share the Trump agenda and never have.
[00:30:01.905 --> 00:30:05.248]  These establishment Republicans will not fight.
[00:30:05.869 --> 00:30:07.331]  And when the fast bullets fly,
[00:30:08.454 --> 00:30:14.220]  As the President, I think, is learning, they will head to the tall grass, as my friend Pat Buchanan would say.
[00:30:15.301 --> 00:30:17.863]  They are not ready for wartime.
[00:30:18.284 --> 00:30:19.705]  This is a war.
[00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:22.368]  I mean, in this narrow sense,
[00:30:22.964 --> 00:30:26.947]  Keith Olbermann, who's a real lunatic, he's right.
[00:30:27.147 --> 00:30:29.089]  It is a war, but it's not a war with Russia.
[00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:32.831]  It's a war with godless globalism.
[00:30:33.292 --> 00:30:38.235]  It is a war with one world government.
[00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:44.220]  That's what they have in mind, and I will fight that with every last
[00:30:44.636 --> 00:30:45.877]  Well, we're doing this.
[00:31:09.177 --> 00:31:12.458]  Excuse me, of saying things that I have not said.
[00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:13.719]  Step up.
[00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:15.260]  Let me take the oath.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.300]  Let me go to the committee.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.001]  Let's take your exact words.
[00:31:20.282 --> 00:31:21.482]  Your exact words.
[00:31:21.822 --> 00:31:22.822]  Piece by piece.
[00:31:22.883 --> 00:31:24.043]  And let's parse them.
[00:31:24.083 --> 00:31:28.445]  We're going to play We're going to play a clip of Senator Warren attacking you in a moment.
[00:31:28.865 --> 00:31:33.247]  And I want you to make a statement to the Senate because they keep trying to kill you and won't actually put you in front of them.
[00:31:33.267 --> 00:31:33.807]  They're scared.
[00:31:33.827 --> 00:31:35.828]  They've been saying for months they're going to call you up there.
[00:31:36.588 --> 00:31:36.768]  But
[00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:47.393]  When they're calling all over the news for killing the President, that's why I used a few cuss words earlier to illustrate the media will say that was bad, but calling for killing the President, that's suddenly okay.
[00:31:47.974 --> 00:32:00.381]  There's got to be a point, Roger Stone, before we play this clip of the Senator, where I don't want to go arrest the Democrats, I don't want to have a war with them, but they want to kill everybody, shut down free speech, kill the President.
[00:32:00.981 --> 00:32:05.604]  At a point, you know, the President has to go ahead and go on the offense instead of the defense.
[00:32:06.664 --> 00:32:07.585]  Well, there's Attorney General.
[00:32:07.645 --> 00:32:08.665]  I mean, they're racketeering.
[00:32:09.826 --> 00:32:11.427]  They're organizing criminal sedition.
[00:32:12.767 --> 00:32:15.249]  They're in every major elite publication saying it.
[00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:18.210]  And they're so belligerent.
[00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.452]  They think after they kill Trump or whatever, they're going to come after me.
[00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:24.094]  And I'm like, you guys can't fight your way out of a wet paper bag.
[00:32:24.154 --> 00:32:26.575]  I mean, I don't say it's that tough or anything.
[00:32:26.655 --> 00:32:28.976]  I want to just build stuff and have a great life.
[00:32:29.557 --> 00:32:34.079]  But like, they're like starting the death battle, in their own words, as you say, with us.
[00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:35.060]  And they're like, we're like,
[00:32:35.737 --> 00:32:36.038]  Really?
[00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:36.621]  Really?
[00:32:37.725 --> 00:32:39.126]  I mean, Podesta can hardly talk.
[00:33:09.006 --> 00:33:10.086]  Sure, it's very simple.
[00:33:10.907 --> 00:33:23.593]  Any inference that any communication I had with Guccifer 2.0 constitutes collusion with the Russian state is false.
[00:33:24.073 --> 00:33:29.256]  First of all, it is unproven at a minimum that he is a Russian asset.
[00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:33.818]  You can go online and there are many, many authoritative theories.
[00:33:34.298 --> 00:33:35.759]  This is another one of the
[00:33:36.303 --> 00:33:38.308]  of the intelligence agency's assessment.
[00:33:38.428 --> 00:33:44.924]  Alex, when they use the word assessment, it's a tip off that they have nothing and that it's a lie.
[00:33:45.618 --> 00:33:47.359]  So that is a falsehood.
[00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:52.923]  Disproved by the content of our exchange, which I have made entirely public.
[00:33:53.203 --> 00:34:02.650]  Disproved by the timing of our exchange, which happens almost six weeks after the WikiLeaks... But you talked about Guccifer in news articles.
[00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.291]  I was trying to talk to Guccifer in WikiLeaks.
[00:34:05.331 --> 00:34:07.353]  That's what everybody... The New York Times was trying to.
[00:34:08.525 --> 00:34:17.031]  Ah, but Congressman Schiff, you see, conflated the order saying that I spoke to him first, then I wrote a piece in his defense.
[00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:20.273]  That is a damnable lie.
[00:34:21.093 --> 00:34:31.140]  I wrote the piece about him and then when I saw that he had been banned on Twitter and then reinstated on Twitter, I sent him a congratulations because
[00:34:31.816 --> 00:34:34.459]  I'm against censorship, Alex.
[00:34:34.499 --> 00:34:51.217]  But I mean, this idea that no one can talk to Russia, including the President, but that all the Democrats can, they're just... Why does everyone kiss their butts so much, including the White House, when there are a bunch of crazy people that think that islands float and that Bush is still in office and that
[00:34:53.184 --> 00:34:54.484]  Putin invaded Korea?
[00:34:54.504 --> 00:34:59.805]  I mean, it's just like, it's like a bunch of crazy clowns are running things.
[00:35:00.285 --> 00:35:01.585]  How did this happen?
[00:35:02.886 --> 00:35:13.788]  Well, and the second point for the Senate, the intimation that I have advanced knowledge of the content of the WikiLeaks disclosures is false.
[00:35:14.348 --> 00:35:22.289]  I have been very forthright about the fact that I had a source, someone who was both a friend of Assange and a friend of mine.
[00:35:22.927 --> 00:35:26.429]  Everything he told me has turned out to be true.
[00:35:26.509 --> 00:35:29.691]  But CNN and Fox News have interviewed Assange.
[00:35:30.152 --> 00:35:31.853]  We've tried... What the hell?
[00:35:31.893 --> 00:35:35.635]  Since when do we make apologies for trying to get Assange on?
[00:35:36.316 --> 00:35:37.657]  I mean, I don't even want to go there.
[00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:39.258]  It's like, of course I'll interview Assange.
[00:35:39.318 --> 00:35:42.820]  What the... I'm just so sick of them, like, making all the rules.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.803]  Like, I'm a Russian agent because I want the Second Amendment and lower taxes.
[00:35:47.923 --> 00:35:48.904]  What the hell?
[00:35:50.151 --> 00:36:03.054]  Well, you see, because I've cultivated a reputation as a badass, which has worked quite well for me in terms of my political career, they think they can hang this on me as an obvious small guy.
[00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:04.974]  Sure, they want to go after you, but let's just expand on that.
[00:36:05.014 --> 00:36:05.934]  Let's just expand on that.
[00:36:06.194 --> 00:36:06.995]  And so here's the good news.
[00:36:07.015 --> 00:36:10.655]  The Roger Stone joining us, StoneColdTruth.com right now, former head of the Trump campaign.
[00:36:12.696 --> 00:36:14.116]  They picked you as a scapegoat.
[00:36:14.136 --> 00:36:16.337]  They picked myself and others as a scapegoat.
[00:36:16.357 --> 00:36:17.117]  They can bring us down.
[00:36:17.137 --> 00:36:18.097]  They can bring everybody down.
[00:36:19.116 --> 00:36:31.761]  But it is crazy to see them openly trying to block the economic recovery of Trump, which is historical and bigger than Reagan's in just 70 days, 70 days tomorrow.
[00:36:32.102 --> 00:36:32.942]  So let's talk about that.
[00:36:32.962 --> 00:36:37.344]  Let's shift gears to another issue, because our listeners know you're not a Russian spy and this is all horse crap and the rest of it.
[00:36:38.923 --> 00:36:40.184]  What are Trump's biggest threats?
[00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:41.545]  What do you think he should do?
[00:36:42.286 --> 00:36:50.314]  What should the listeners do in this epic battle to try to restore the republic, bring back prosperity, free market, all the things Trump's doing?
[00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:54.859]  I mean, what else is on your big board, your big radar screen?
[00:36:55.746 --> 00:37:01.468]  Well, I think it's important, and I hope the President understands that he has the power.
[00:37:02.068 --> 00:37:08.731]  He has the power to order the immediate release of all of the governmental records regarding Operation Dragnet.
[00:37:09.318 --> 00:37:18.643]  Which, uh, which, uh, InfoWars exposed as having wiretapped Donald Trump, uh, monitored and recorded his telephone conversation as early as 2004.
[00:37:18.683 --> 00:37:20.304]  Yeah, pull up Dragnet, guys.
[00:37:20.324 --> 00:37:21.105]  NSA spied on Trump.
[00:37:21.565 --> 00:37:27.028]  And, and notice, notice that you mentioned that no media, they cover everything we do, no media even said it was fake.
[00:37:27.348 --> 00:37:32.071]  Cause those are real Trump phone numbers, my real number, my, my real old office secret address.
[00:37:32.451 --> 00:37:35.673]  That's a real database of everybody being spied on by Obama.
[00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:49.843]  Right, so we now know that they were monitoring and recording Donald Trump's phone calls from his New York office, his New York apartment, his apartment at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, which is really extraordinary.
[00:37:50.399 --> 00:37:56.601]  Uh, and several of his resort facilities where he plays golf and may have used the phone.
[00:37:56.681 --> 00:37:57.842]  And notice, zero coverage.
[00:37:57.882 --> 00:38:01.163]  You personally, I've got other Trump's other numbers.
[00:38:01.203 --> 00:38:02.604]  You gave me his DeMar DeLago number.
[00:38:02.624 --> 00:38:05.865]  I never even called it because it's just so weird to call a president his private deal.
[00:38:05.885 --> 00:38:07.085]  But the point is, you talked to him with that.
[00:38:07.345 --> 00:38:08.146]  Let's not get into all of it.
[00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:09.806]  But the point is, these are real numbers.
[00:38:09.846 --> 00:38:11.927]  This is a real NSA spy base.
[00:38:12.307 --> 00:38:13.528]  I mean, this is really going on.
[00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:16.549]  So what does it show they were spying on him eight years ago?
[00:38:17.728 --> 00:38:19.890]  Well, because they were keeping tabs.
[00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:29.418]  One of these NSIA guys was quoted in congressional hearings saying, we don't monitor people because they're bad.
[00:38:29.878 --> 00:38:31.820]  We monitor them because they're interesting.
[00:38:32.857 --> 00:38:35.060]  That's chilling, in my opinion.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.704]  So the question is not, did they tap the president?
[00:38:38.724 --> 00:38:40.265]  The question is, did they ever stop?
[00:38:41.427 --> 00:38:44.650]  I think we're going to find that he has been monitored the entire time.
[00:38:45.331 --> 00:38:47.934]  When this woman, former General Evelyn
[00:38:49.008 --> 00:39:04.593]  Barkus blurted it out yesterday and now she's... Oh yeah, what do you make of the former head of the Pentagon's Russia operation, deputy defense department head, who's been, you know, shopping around all this stuff, saying, oh of course we spied on Trump, we have the evidence, which they've been denying they did.
[00:39:06.193 --> 00:39:07.714]  Yeah, so she blurted it out.
[00:39:07.814 --> 00:39:11.835]  Today she seemed to be in denial or backpedaling.
[00:39:12.315 --> 00:39:18.517]  An incredible statement yesterday by Ray McGovern and William Binney, both former
[00:39:39.895 --> 00:39:43.478]  That team was infiltrated by the CIA.
[00:39:43.618 --> 00:39:44.479]  They knew everything.
[00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:48.162]  They botched the operation purposely to bring Nixon down.
[00:39:48.482 --> 00:39:50.543]  Read my book, Nixon's Secrets.
[00:39:50.944 --> 00:39:56.088]  But now you have Barack Obama using the full machinery
[00:39:56.568 --> 00:39:58.949]  And let's be clear, let me just stop you.
[00:39:58.969 --> 00:40:03.272]  Let me just stop you, Roger Stone, because we've covered all this.
[00:40:03.292 --> 00:40:05.313]  We should do a timeline, though, for new viewers.
[00:40:22.458 --> 00:40:26.180]  They come out, he's elected November 8th.
[00:40:26.661 --> 00:40:32.944]  Within two days they say, we have intel intercepts at Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, and everybody else are Russian agents.
[00:40:33.365 --> 00:40:35.226]  They say it right through to inauguration day.
[00:40:35.246 --> 00:40:36.567]  They publish it over and over again.
[00:40:37.307 --> 00:40:40.929]  Matthew Rosenberg, all of them, he talks about it on inauguration day before he walked in.
[00:40:40.949 --> 00:40:43.711]  30 minutes before the president, you know, was sworn in.
[00:40:45.802 --> 00:40:48.423]  That's a famous, you know, 30-minute video with millions of views on YouTube.
[00:40:48.823 --> 00:40:49.463]  We did that live.
[00:40:50.023 --> 00:40:56.525]  And so we're sitting there, and they're saying, we have the intercepts, we have the communiques, we spied on him, he's with Russia, horrible things.
[00:40:56.885 --> 00:40:58.586]  And then Trump goes, oh, that's a leak, that's illegal.
[00:40:58.606 --> 00:41:00.986]  They go, oh, it doesn't matter, we can do what we want.
[00:41:01.066 --> 00:41:02.527]  The President Obama told us we could.
[00:41:03.007 --> 00:41:04.607]  Hundreds of articles, literally hundreds everywhere.
[00:41:05.287 --> 00:41:07.628]  Dozens per major newspaper, every day, new articles.
[00:41:08.208 --> 00:41:10.629]  Then they go, oh, Trump's insane, none of it ever existed.
[00:41:11.693 --> 00:41:12.253]  A month ago.
[00:41:12.414 --> 00:41:14.575]  And then Nunes comes out and everybody's like, okay, yeah.
[00:41:14.735 --> 00:41:21.400]  And they're now back with these Republicans in the Senate going, oh yeah, we do have intelligence in the intercepts of all this Russian stuff.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.120]  We're going to bring it out.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:27.284]  So again, I've never seen such flip-flopping.
[00:41:28.604 --> 00:41:29.585]  It's cartoon level.
[00:41:30.005 --> 00:41:31.286]  What is the method to this?
[00:41:31.767 --> 00:41:33.528]  Or is it just pure madness, Roger Stone?
[00:41:34.767 --> 00:41:42.250]  No, earlier in the show, Alex, they played a clip of somebody from the New York Times trying to deny that that headline says what it says.
[00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.611]  There it is in black and white.
[00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:48.813]  So if I was wiretapped, if I was surveilled,
[00:41:49.767 --> 00:41:50.708]  I'd like to know why.
[00:41:50.788 --> 00:41:52.849]  Where is the probable cause?
[00:41:53.149 --> 00:41:54.830]  Where is the evidence?
[00:42:19.988 --> 00:42:22.455]  And now they point at Rand Paul two weeks ago.
[00:42:22.475 --> 00:42:23.257]  What'd you make of that?
[00:42:24.568 --> 00:42:27.549]  And McCain goes, you work for Putin, you are an agent.
[00:42:28.189 --> 00:42:35.670]  I mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a guy that shoots his mouth off, but man, if that asshole is sitting there calling me a Russian agent, I'm, I'm, Rand Paul had a lot of guts to just walk out of there.
[00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:44.752]  I mean, it's just, it's an American, it is so insulting to hear I'm an agent of a foreign power when all I do is defend this country against globalists and we've been sold out.
[00:42:45.152 --> 00:42:46.612]  It pisses me off, man.
[00:42:46.912 --> 00:42:50.493]  And I used to tell you, settle down, settle down for months bitching.
[00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:51.593]  And now I get it.
[00:42:51.673 --> 00:42:53.093]  It's like something fundamental.
[00:42:54.662 --> 00:42:56.823]  Well, and where is Mitch McConnell?
[00:42:56.843 --> 00:43:04.746]  Because disparaging the character of a senator is a violation of the rules.
[00:43:04.887 --> 00:43:13.710]  I guarantee you that if this were some conservative questioning the patriotism of some liberal, believe me, the Senate would be in high doubt.
[00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.052]  Member Pocahontas got her thing questioned and the senator got censured.
[00:43:18.194 --> 00:43:18.874]  Exactly right.
[00:43:19.015 --> 00:43:24.958]  And she should have been because she broke the rules in the oldest deliberative body.
[00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:33.824]  Let me ask you this, where does McCain get off pointing at Senator Rand Paul and saying you work for Putin, you're a Russian agent?
[00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:34.304]  What?
[00:43:34.804 --> 00:43:37.966]  I mean, in the old days, in Andrew Jackson's time, they'd go, let's go out in the street, man.
[00:43:38.287 --> 00:43:42.809]  I mean, it's like our honor when we are the most Americana people.
[00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:43.890]  And I'm not shooting my mouth off.
[00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:44.811]  I never had to talk like this.
[00:43:44.851 --> 00:43:49.934]  But my God, who would have ever said you or I or Trump weren't for this country?
[00:43:49.994 --> 00:43:51.735]  We're the ones trying to save the country.
[00:43:52.595 --> 00:43:53.856]  So how far does this go?
[00:43:53.876 --> 00:43:54.797]  Let me ask you this.
[00:43:55.197 --> 00:43:56.538]  Where does the Russia thing go now?
[00:43:56.578 --> 00:43:58.859]  Because they're just quadrupling down.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.561]  They have these coward Republican senators on board.
[00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:02.862]  What the hell?
[00:44:04.878 --> 00:44:06.259]  Well, there's no there there.
[00:44:06.299 --> 00:44:07.200]  That's their problem.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:12.646]  See, therefore, the proof of this crime has to be manufactured.
[00:44:12.706 --> 00:44:18.332]  That's why they trumped up this Guccifer 2.0 thing.
[00:44:18.912 --> 00:44:23.717]  Because it gets you the headline, Trump Associate Under FBI Investigation.
[00:44:24.229 --> 00:44:37.493]  Trump Associate admits communications with Russian hacker, misleading McCarthyism, headlines that are designed to deceive because they don't tell the full story.
[00:44:37.793 --> 00:44:39.433]  They have nothing.
[00:44:39.733 --> 00:44:41.254]  They are empty handed.
[00:44:41.334 --> 00:44:43.014]  That's why they're scrambling.
[00:44:43.234 --> 00:44:47.555]  And that's why I am betting that they do not have the balls.
[00:44:48.015 --> 00:44:53.417]  Call me before the Senate or the House because I will take their exact words.
[00:44:53.877 --> 00:44:56.558]  And I will shove them down their throats!
[00:44:56.938 --> 00:45:03.539]  What do they have on the Jolly Green Giant, Comey, that he bends over backwards?
[00:45:03.559 --> 00:45:13.281]  We learned he was doing Russia Ties July last year, and all this crap, and then saying no one spies on anybody, nobody spies on Trump, worse than Clapper.
[00:45:13.761 --> 00:45:15.962]  What is going on with the Jolly Green Giant?
[00:45:17.982 --> 00:45:23.023]  How much money did this guy make at HSBC in their shady dealings?
[00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:32.663]  I don't understand why the President hasn't fired him because it's very clear that he perjured himself in front of the House Intelligence Committee.
[00:45:33.344 --> 00:45:36.310]  He and Admiral Rogers both said there was
[00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:39.436]  No surveillance of Donald Trump.
[00:45:39.856 --> 00:45:40.136]  None.
[00:45:40.696 --> 00:45:42.977]  That is provably a lie.
[00:45:43.417 --> 00:45:56.082]  And then when Devin Nunes, who I think is a man of courage, a real patriot, steps forward, gets the proof, rushes to the White House to give it to the commander in chief, we attack him for leaking.
[00:45:56.542 --> 00:45:56.882]  Really?
[00:45:57.509 --> 00:45:57.889]  Really?
[00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:00.591]  You're the guys who leak General Flynn's phone calls.
[00:46:00.851 --> 00:46:04.333]  You're the ones who leak the President's calls with foreign leaders.
[00:46:04.654 --> 00:46:08.036]  You're the ones who leak... By the way, let me stop you.
[00:46:08.056 --> 00:46:14.720]  They're now leaking, they're now leaking, they're now leaking with high-level intelligence stuff who told the President.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.902]  It's not dirty that somebody told the President who was being spied on.
[00:46:18.282 --> 00:46:24.006]  They act like the President isn't allowed any powers of even a bottle washer or a clerk or a
[00:46:24.686 --> 00:46:26.147]  So let me ask you this, Roger Stone.
[00:46:26.408 --> 00:46:28.329]  So we have a huge audience on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:46:29.029 --> 00:46:36.215]  Everybody on Facebook and Twitter and on YouTube should know we're being censored, but despite their algorithms, this is going viral to hundreds of thousands per channel.
[00:46:36.235 --> 00:46:37.616]  We used to do millions, but they're blocking us.
[00:46:38.196 --> 00:46:39.537]  Go on your own Facebook page.
[00:46:39.597 --> 00:46:40.938]  Go on your own whatever.
[00:46:40.978 --> 00:46:43.400]  Tell folks right now, tune in to Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.502]  This is the information they don't want you to have.
[00:46:45.822 --> 00:46:50.005]  Infowars.com forward slash show has our own feed if they cut this out or block it.
[00:46:50.305 --> 00:46:51.906]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:46:53.027 --> 00:46:54.488]  Retweet at Real Alex Jones?
[00:46:54.568 --> 00:46:54.869]  Whatever.
[00:46:54.909 --> 00:46:56.290]  We're in a war, folks.
[00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:58.031]  I am totally committed to this.
[00:46:58.632 --> 00:46:59.813]  So is Roger Stone.
[00:47:00.733 --> 00:47:01.834]  We're moving forward.
[00:47:02.355 --> 00:47:04.516]  And just understand that I'm up here at 927.
[00:47:05.097 --> 00:47:05.717]  I'm not bitching.
[00:47:06.038 --> 00:47:08.860]  Wild horses, you know, like Rolling Stone says, couldn't drag me away.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.242]  But I'm so honored to be here.
[00:47:11.702 --> 00:47:19.088]  But just understand, it's people shopping at Infowarsstore.com on the amazing, game-changing nutraceuticals and supplements we have, like X2.
[00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:22.271]  Roger, I'm going to go back to you in just a moment.
[00:47:22.311 --> 00:47:33.301]  Let me just point out to folks, it was four years ago that we were putting out iodine supplements that you now see in stores everywhere, because iodine is a good halogen, fluoride and bromine and bromide are the bad ones, they're in everything.
[00:47:34.401 --> 00:47:42.563]  And because we had people basically doing industrial sabotage to block us, the DEA controls iodine because it can be used to make a bunch of stuff, you name it.
[00:47:43.003 --> 00:47:45.964]  It might seem Breaking Bad, it's what you use to make everything.
[00:47:46.944 --> 00:47:49.625]  The point is though, it's a legal element, you can have it.
[00:47:50.405 --> 00:47:50.745]  Okay?
[00:47:51.185 --> 00:47:53.426]  And the way we put it in palm oil, it's not used for anything illegal.
[00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:56.627]  But to get the crystals from deep earth mining,
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:05.364]  That's something that only drug companies, the Pentagon, which is also used, strangely enough, in nerve gas, but whatever, it's really important.
[00:48:05.404 --> 00:48:10.086]  I mean, a drop of real iodine will eat through concrete like alien blood in a 1970s movie.
[00:48:10.106 --> 00:48:11.246]  That's not real, but this is.
[00:48:11.767 --> 00:48:23.212]  It's so powerful that when it's organically through gas, through Russian patent that we got, we're all Russian agents, my guy with the Russian connection, just like NASA's rockets go up on Russian boosters, we have it.
[00:48:24.312 --> 00:48:25.292]  We've had this four years.
[00:48:25.512 --> 00:48:28.133]  I've had some of the biggest companies out there come and try to buy it from us.
[00:48:29.914 --> 00:48:34.756]  And they wanted us to then be able to just put it in shampoo but no longer put it on ourselves.
[00:48:35.076 --> 00:48:37.117]  I probably should have done it, but the point is I didn't do it.
[00:48:37.577 --> 00:48:42.599]  They've now gone, because they use oil drilling companies, there's only two states in the U.S.
[00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:43.539]  that actually have this.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.480]  They hit it at 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.981]  Natural gas is at 15,000.
[00:48:47.441 --> 00:48:49.662]  It's a distillate or a derivative or
[00:48:50.362 --> 00:48:56.468]  You know, something else they hit, sometimes like oils at 6,000 feet, they get that, a little side shoot, and the natural gas is super deep now.
[00:48:56.488 --> 00:48:59.751]  I mean, on our own property, we got 15,000 foot deep wells.
[00:49:00.391 --> 00:49:04.275]  Coal, putting us out of business, we don't make much money off of it, but whatever, coal's for everybody, so I'm for it.
[00:49:04.295 --> 00:49:08.979]  I love how they say I work for oil companies, but our family actually has gas wells, and coal knocks us out.
[00:49:09.559 --> 00:49:15.104]  So instead of getting $100,000 a month, you know, family gets like $5,000 a month, but it's just side issues, how the economy works.
[00:49:15.144 --> 00:49:15.485]  I'm glad.
[00:49:15.505 --> 00:49:16.446]  I want America to be back on.
[00:49:17.126 --> 00:49:17.647]  It doesn't bother me.
[00:49:17.687 --> 00:49:20.970]  I've never gotten that money anyways, but the point is I know about oil and gas.
[00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.794]  I've got a family that are petroleum geologists and you name it.
[00:49:24.934 --> 00:49:27.436]  In fact, most of the family's done that after they got out of the military.
[00:49:27.456 --> 00:49:28.958]  It's kind of a family business.
[00:49:28.998 --> 00:49:37.907]  But what I'm getting at here is, after all this is Texas, is that we have the last shipment coming in.
[00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:43.995]  That we're about to sell out, and one more shipment's coming in at 20,000 bottles that would normally last us five, six months.
[00:49:45.016 --> 00:49:50.621]  And right now, they found out that we were buying it all up, and it's more the political hits, man.
[00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:53.103]  They kicked us, it was 3.3 million last year on Google Ads.
[00:49:53.643 --> 00:49:55.845]  Profit to then put the company to fund things.
[00:49:56.766 --> 00:49:57.267]  Oh, we have the video?
[00:49:57.287 --> 00:49:58.608]  Okay, we'll play it in a moment, then go back to Roger.
[00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:01.870]  We'll play it in a moment, then go back to Roger, then I'll play the senator attacking Roger.
[00:50:03.214 --> 00:50:10.217]  And so, they try to shut us down getting the distillate from seaweed that's still DEA controlled because it's 999.
[00:50:10.417 --> 00:50:10.857]  It's not 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
[00:50:14.986 --> 00:50:15.186]  I think?
[00:50:35.134 --> 00:50:37.416]  In fact, my people are like, look, leave it alone.
[00:50:37.436 --> 00:50:38.476]  We're probably going to fix it.
[00:50:38.997 --> 00:50:39.797]  Don't make an issue.
[00:50:40.218 --> 00:50:41.158]  I'm going to make an issue.
[00:50:41.599 --> 00:50:42.499]  Iodine's an element.
[00:50:42.599 --> 00:50:43.580]  We've got the best type.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.161]  The other stuff's bound as garbage.
[00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:46.001]  It'll hurt you.
[00:50:47.022 --> 00:50:48.123]  This is incredible stuff.
[00:50:48.203 --> 00:50:48.843]  It's helping everybody.
[00:50:48.863 --> 00:50:49.304]  It's helped me.
[00:50:49.324 --> 00:50:51.305]  And I don't want to get into the whole back story.
[00:50:51.345 --> 00:50:54.827]  I will if I have to, but this may be the last shipment we get of this.
[00:50:55.448 --> 00:50:56.649]  Four years has been a good run.
[00:50:57.409 --> 00:50:59.311]  Nobody else has got deep earth crystal sources.
[00:51:00.476 --> 00:51:02.977]  I don't even have to plug this for it to sell out.
[00:51:03.037 --> 00:51:03.578]  It'll just come in.
[00:51:03.618 --> 00:51:07.299]  But I'm still 30% off and on Biotricillinium from the mustard seed.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.000]  They go together like a horse and carriage.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.141]  But that funds us.
[00:51:10.181 --> 00:51:11.081]  Roger Stone's book, $9.95.
[00:51:13.342 --> 00:51:16.244]  Trump 2020 shirts, we make like $4 or $5 to fund our operation.
[00:51:16.844 --> 00:51:18.605]  I mean, I'm not complaining.
[00:51:18.645 --> 00:51:21.266]  I had some behind-the-scenes conversations with Roger and Corsi today.
[00:51:22.006 --> 00:51:22.847]  It's not just us.
[00:51:22.987 --> 00:51:24.207]  It's Daily Caller.
[00:51:24.307 --> 00:51:24.988]  It's everybody.
[00:51:25.488 --> 00:51:26.749]  They're coming after Trump.
[00:51:27.509 --> 00:51:28.209]  And I'm not bitching.
[00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:29.210]  I wanted to fight them.
[00:51:30.296 --> 00:51:30.996]  I wanted to win.
[00:51:31.237 --> 00:51:32.157]  I wanted to take them on.
[00:51:33.378 --> 00:51:47.166]  Just know, when you get Roger Stone's book and give it to somebody that doesn't know the truth, or you get a t-shirt and wear it in public, or you get X2, which you and your family need to begin with, you know, them demonizing me and lying about me gets me angry.
[00:51:48.267 --> 00:51:52.189]  But when I've got a really good product,
[00:51:53.795 --> 00:52:08.369]  And it's not just with the iodine, it's another big national manufacturer that's one of the top organic brand names said, yeah, you private labeled our stuff and we appreciate you, but we just got threatened.
[00:52:08.389 --> 00:52:16.997]  I mean, I had a top CIA guy on two weeks ago and I can't even say his name, but I talked to him today and he said, listen,
[00:52:18.753 --> 00:52:19.953]  I can't come on anymore.
[00:52:20.113 --> 00:52:22.114]  They're threatening my business and my family.
[00:52:22.434 --> 00:52:23.734]  This guy was a section chief.
[00:52:25.595 --> 00:52:31.116]  And you're sitting there talking to a guy that does stuff all over the world, but they're threatening him so bad for coming on and supporting Trump.
[00:52:32.057 --> 00:52:32.937]  He's rolling over.
[00:52:33.077 --> 00:52:35.718]  And it's like, it makes you feel really cold.
[00:52:36.518 --> 00:52:37.458]  It makes you feel alone.
[00:52:37.478 --> 00:52:39.739]  And I'm not saying he's not a man and not tough.
[00:52:41.679 --> 00:52:44.660]  It's just like, I'm not giving up, neither is Roger, because
[00:52:46.425 --> 00:52:47.386]  I don't understand.
[00:52:47.506 --> 00:52:56.773]  Death is rolling over to these people and, you know, it pisses me off when they are... I've got a lot of tentacles.
[00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:58.495]  You know, I've known they're going to attack us.
[00:52:58.555 --> 00:52:59.576]  I've grown a lot of tentacles.
[00:53:00.726 --> 00:53:00.986]  I don't
[00:53:25.882 --> 00:53:30.103]  And they sued my dad for putting him in a coma, and a lot of other people, but the point was he asked for it.
[00:53:30.603 --> 00:53:39.406]  And you know what, at the end of the day, that guy might have been six feet tall, flunked three grades, might have weighed 250 pounds, he thought it was gonna kick the ass of a 140 pound person.
[00:53:39.646 --> 00:53:43.007]  I crawled on top of him, and I knocked his teeth out.
[00:53:44.019 --> 00:53:45.660]  And that's what it comes down to.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.501]  Look, I may die trying, but you get in a fight with me, man.
[00:53:48.581 --> 00:53:51.182]  It's going all the way, all the way.
[00:53:51.582 --> 00:53:53.904]  They're saying, you get in a fight with me, you got full commitment.
[00:53:53.924 --> 00:53:55.524]  It stopped me acting like a tough son of a bitch.
[00:53:55.904 --> 00:53:57.025]  I'm a human being, man.
[00:53:57.105 --> 00:53:58.966]  I'm a man like my ancestors.
[00:53:59.006 --> 00:54:00.326]  You want a war, you got one.
[00:54:00.466 --> 00:54:04.848]  And it pisses me off to see them shutting us down.
[00:54:06.129 --> 00:54:12.113]  It's having victories on the news and it's celebrating it and you're sitting there that have already supported us.
[00:54:12.613 --> 00:54:27.884]  If you would just support us as much as you supported some stupid football team you spent thousands of dollars a year on for dumbass front page tickets, I would have all the best reporters, all the crew, all the money to throw against the enemy in a committed war.
[00:54:38.452 --> 00:54:38.793]  I think?
[00:54:54.434 --> 00:55:09.925]  Vitamin B12 that people inject, but I can't say inject it because it's for end of the tongue, but we just go and say, why don't we put out pharmaceutical grade organic stuff that's $200 for a little ampule and we'll just do it industrially and sell it for $29 with 10 times as much in the container.
[00:55:10.185 --> 00:55:16.569]  I mean, it's that type of like crazy good stuff we've got for you and your family that is game changing because I love you.
[00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:20.092]  I don't need to put you down to feel confident.
[00:55:20.732 --> 00:55:21.612]  And so that's where we are.
[00:55:21.652 --> 00:55:22.793]  So Roger, I'm ranting.
[00:55:23.273 --> 00:55:25.393]  It's just that I'm not even feeling sorry for myself.
[00:55:26.114 --> 00:55:34.676]  I almost feel bad that we don't bitch enough to let people know you're in court with Democrat judges trying to, millions of dollars trying to shut you down.
[00:55:34.996 --> 00:55:37.497]  The Senate committee, you've been poisoned with polonium.
[00:55:37.737 --> 00:55:38.698]  You've been t-boned.
[00:55:38.938 --> 00:55:40.078]  They're coming after your family.
[00:55:40.118 --> 00:55:41.418]  We can't talk about behind the scenes stuff.
[00:55:41.678 --> 00:55:43.079]  Think about what Trump's gone through.
[00:55:43.359 --> 00:55:44.720]  I think Alex, the answer is follow the leader.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.581]  In other words, Donald Trump has the power.
[00:56:11.857 --> 00:56:16.840]  He has the power to empower a grand jury or have his attorney- And that's why they're hysterical.
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:17.720]  Why are they hysterical?
[00:56:19.361 --> 00:56:21.082]  They're hysterical because they're losing.
[00:56:21.502 --> 00:56:28.625]  They're hysterical because despite all their incredible advantages, they just blew the 2016 election.
[00:56:28.645 --> 00:56:32.087]  $2 billion on their side, $275 million, maybe, on our side.
[00:56:32.107 --> 00:56:33.048]  Plus the mainstream media.
[00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:54.075]  Particularly on television and cable, you know, humping for them, running anti-Trump commercials, posing as news round-the-clock, plus fooling with our... 20th Century Fox put out over a hundred fake news sites attacking Trump, Roger Stone, and then Alex Jones.
[00:56:54.375 --> 00:56:55.375]  So we got to be proud.
[00:56:55.415 --> 00:56:58.216]  It's not about ego, but Trump, Roger Stone, Alex Jones.
[00:56:58.256 --> 00:56:59.237]  Why do you think that's the case?
[00:57:00.317 --> 00:57:01.577]  Well, because we're effective.
[00:57:01.897 --> 00:57:02.378]  That's why.
[00:57:02.458 --> 00:57:03.858]  Because we are winning.
[00:57:03.998 --> 00:57:04.518]  That's why.
[00:57:04.578 --> 00:57:06.279]  Because we are fearless.
[00:57:06.419 --> 00:57:06.879]  That's why.
[00:57:07.418 --> 00:57:13.261]  Look, you can't help but go on Twitter and see this torrent of hatred.
[00:57:13.982 --> 00:57:22.527]  They say they're going to kill my wife, they're going to kill my dog, they're going to kill my family, that I should rot in hell, that I should rot in prison.
[00:57:22.547 --> 00:57:27.830]  Well, those who are waiting for a perp walk are going to be sadly mistaken.
[00:57:28.365 --> 00:57:36.128]  It's the Loretta Lynches and the Ray Clappers who will be doing the perp walk when this is all over.
[00:57:36.408 --> 00:57:38.409]  This is a fight to the death.
[00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:41.030]  It's been a long, hard day.
[00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:43.311]  But one thing, Alex, I have to tell you.
[00:57:43.832 --> 00:57:50.695]  Yesterday on the show, and it seemed like a hundred years ago, I said that I would be in the New York County Courthouse downtown.
[00:57:51.295 --> 00:57:55.096]  And I said to InfoWars viewers, please, I need your support.
[00:57:55.577 --> 00:57:56.217]  I need your help.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.021]  We had a good contingent show up today.
[00:57:59.461 --> 00:58:02.703]  Some from New Jersey, some from Connecticut, some from New York.
[00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:03.743]  Good people.
[00:58:04.083 --> 00:58:06.384]  Patriots who are there for no other reason.
[00:58:06.404 --> 00:58:07.405]  Don't they give you strength?
[00:58:07.485 --> 00:58:08.225]  Aren't they humble?
[00:58:08.265 --> 00:58:09.405]  Don't they make you feel humble?
[00:58:11.206 --> 00:58:23.732]  They make me feel proud because these are gutsy patriots who are there to see this fraudulent fraud on the court, which is what it is.
[00:58:23.812 --> 00:58:26.313]  There I am today at the courthouse.
[00:58:26.957 --> 00:58:28.537]  Good looking suit, if I do say so myself.
[00:58:28.557 --> 00:58:30.138]  Well, we've got a huge record audience.
[00:58:30.178 --> 00:58:32.118]  I know you're tired at 10.30 your time.
[00:58:32.138 --> 00:58:34.059]  Do you want to keep going or do you want to end this, Roger?
[00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:35.579]  We could take some Twitter questions, like I said.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.060]  I've got to wrap it up, Alex.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:46.622]  I am exhausted and I don't want to make a mistake because when you do make a mistake, they jump on it like they've never made one.
[00:58:47.342 --> 00:58:50.723]  Let's play the Senator's clip and then we'll go back with the final comment from you.
[00:58:51.364 --> 00:58:52.484]  Let's play the Senator's clip.
[00:58:53.915 --> 00:58:54.576]  Let's roll that.
[00:58:55.136 --> 00:58:55.876]  Here's the Senator's Club.
[00:58:55.896 --> 00:58:56.617]  You guys got that ready?
[00:58:57.438 --> 00:58:58.338]  Here is Warner.
[00:58:58.438 --> 00:58:58.838]  Here it is.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:17.011]  Are you confident that, say, Paul Manafort could be subpoenaed before your committee and that you and Chairman Burr would work together to make sure that happened, to make sure Carter Page got subpoenaed, Roger Stone, all these other names that we're hearing?
[00:59:18.832 --> 00:59:20.453]  We've got our first public hearing next week.
[00:59:20.733 --> 00:59:27.816]  We think it's important to kind of lay the predicate to show what Russia's done, not just in America, but in what they've done in Europe as well.
[00:59:28.476 --> 00:59:31.638]  We are going and starting interviewing people right now.
[00:59:32.098 --> 00:59:34.259]  We have a number of the names that you've talked about.
[00:59:34.779 --> 00:59:37.360]  I imagine we will be hearing testimony from them.
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:40.461]  We've seen the case of Mr. Stone, for example.
[00:59:40.501 --> 00:59:41.802]  He's kind of hit the trifecta.
[00:59:42.362 --> 00:59:45.345]  He talked about the fact that he had been in contact with WikiLeaks.
[00:59:45.705 --> 00:59:49.168]  He talked about the fact that he knew about Podesta being in the barrel.
[00:59:49.528 --> 00:59:53.452]  And he acknowledged recently he had contact with Guccifer 2, which was a Russian agent.
[00:59:53.472 --> 00:59:58.176]  I mean... Lie!
[00:59:58.376 --> 00:59:58.816]  Lie!
[00:59:59.036 --> 00:59:59.397]  Lie!
[00:59:59.497 --> 01:00:00.898]  Senator, you're a liar!
[01:00:01.038 --> 01:00:03.020]  You're a stone-cold liar!
[01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:08.195]  And you do not have the cojones to face me on the Senate floor.
[01:00:08.456 --> 01:00:11.559]  You do not have the balls to let me defend myself.
[01:00:11.619 --> 01:00:14.442]  You just told three outrageous lies.
[01:00:14.803 --> 01:00:18.988]  That this guy is in the US Senate seat of Harry F. Byrd.
[01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:20.528]  He is a disgrace.
[01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:22.749]  He is a disgrace to the U.S.
[01:00:22.769 --> 01:00:25.510]  Senate, and he has maligned me.
[01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:28.310]  Let's see if they have the balls to call me.
[01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.911]  I am so anxious to put you in your place.
[01:00:31.951 --> 01:00:38.233]  You've already gone over the facts, but just responding, it's on record that everybody was trying to get a hold of him, including CNN, all of them.
[01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:41.554]  You talked to him after you'd written articles about him.
[01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:43.795]  You talked to him on Twitter when he was reinstated.
[01:00:43.815 --> 01:00:45.115]  That's a public conversation.
[01:00:46.416 --> 01:00:50.758]  I mean, obviously everybody knew about Podesta and Russia ties.
[01:00:50.778 --> 01:00:52.559]  That had been in the front page of the New York Times.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.521]  This is all literal horse crap.
[01:00:55.761 --> 01:00:56.482]  Yeah, it is.
[01:00:56.542 --> 01:00:58.883]  This guy, he's a demagogue.
[01:00:59.283 --> 01:01:00.464]  He's a charlatan.
[01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:02.385]  I guess he thinks he's running for president.
[01:01:02.786 --> 01:01:04.327]  But that's not going to happen.
[01:01:04.747 --> 01:01:07.028]  No, I have been smeared.
[01:01:07.408 --> 01:01:08.809]  You have been smeared.
[01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:11.711]  Paul Manafort has been smeared.
[01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:14.673]  General Flynn has been smeared.
[01:01:15.057 --> 01:01:17.860]  And we demand our day in court.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.023]  In this case, we demand our day before the Senate.
[01:01:21.163 --> 01:01:23.505]  Well, I know you've been up since 5 a.m.
[01:01:23.525 --> 01:01:25.447]  New York time, so I'm going to let you go in two minutes.
[01:01:26.108 --> 01:01:33.295]  Just, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, longtime confidant, let me ask you this question.
[01:01:35.302 --> 01:01:36.503]  Where does it end?
[01:01:36.623 --> 01:01:43.169]  Because even if they're losing their fake Russian narrative, it makes it where it's impossible to ever even talk to Russia, which is normal.
[01:01:43.529 --> 01:01:46.832]  So if the President, they're saying, even meets with Putin, it's like, oh my God, he's a Russian agent.
[01:01:47.172 --> 01:01:51.476]  Even though Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, everybody, Barack Obama, George W., they all did it.
[01:01:52.116 --> 01:01:54.398]  I mean, it's just like so shrill.
[01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:55.840]  Are they failing?
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.720]  Are they winning?
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.722]  I mean, where do you see this?
[01:01:58.742 --> 01:01:59.403]  Because I agree.
[01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:01.323]  They're failing.
[01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:02.023]  They're in trouble.
[01:02:02.484 --> 01:02:03.584]  People are seeing through them.
[01:02:03.984 --> 01:02:05.004]  They've jumped the shark.
[01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:06.845]  They've illegally spied.
[01:02:06.925 --> 01:02:07.545]  Nothing's there.
[01:02:08.465 --> 01:02:09.185]  So you're a smart guy.
[01:02:09.205 --> 01:02:13.587]  You've looked in the crystal ball, like few I know, and called things like they are.
[01:02:14.227 --> 01:02:16.047]  So where is this going?
[01:02:16.087 --> 01:02:23.810]  Because, you know, I sit there and laugh when they're on the news going, Alex is under, Alex Jones is under criminal investigation for getting directives by Russian intelligence.
[01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:28.311]  And I'm like, I'm getting directives, baby, from George frickin' Washington.
[01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.692]  You know, I don't want to go into the whole pedigree, but it's ridiculous.
[01:02:32.272 --> 01:02:38.314]  And so, it's like, I want to laugh at it, but then I realize, some of the public are dumbasses.
[01:02:38.374 --> 01:02:41.895]  So, in closing, where do you see this going?
[01:02:41.935 --> 01:02:44.635]  Like, picture adventure, picture ending novels.
[01:02:44.775 --> 01:02:46.096]  We have more teenagers or kids.
[01:02:46.436 --> 01:02:47.156]  Three different endings.
[01:02:47.176 --> 01:02:49.837]  How does this end, according to what we do?
[01:02:51.297 --> 01:02:55.758]  Well, first of all, Alex, I think they have built their house on a foundation of sand.
[01:02:56.459 --> 01:02:57.419]  At the end of the day,
[01:02:57.992 --> 01:03:02.473]  They will produce no proof of a Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.
[01:03:03.174 --> 01:03:04.514]  But it's Donald Trump.
[01:03:04.534 --> 01:03:12.797]  It's the President who has the power to begin prosecutions on the leakers, begin questioning those who have... So say it now.
[01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:13.617]  Trump listens.
[01:03:13.637 --> 01:03:14.237]  You know he does.
[01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:19.519]  We won't get into our recent conversation, but what is President Trump executing now?
[01:03:19.919 --> 01:03:21.459]  I know he's got the will and the courage.
[01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:23.960]  I love Sessions, but he's been acting like, you know...
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:32.362]  No, I think the President should tell Attorney General Sessions to forget about fighting legal marijuana and start fighting the corruption of the Obama Administration.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:50.586]  Again, these people who are now in this administration, they are never been in this position before.
[01:03:51.066 --> 01:03:54.769]  And the president has awesome power to clear the air.
[01:03:55.229 --> 01:03:58.512]  He can declassify documents on their spying.
[01:03:58.888 --> 01:04:03.349]  He can declassify documents alleging Russian collusion.
[01:04:03.809 --> 01:04:11.412]  And he can have his Attorney General impanel a grand jury and start dragging the Obama-ites one by one.
[01:04:11.492 --> 01:04:19.674]  Because, you see, lying on television, like we just saw Senator Warner do, is very different than lying to a federal grand jury.
[01:04:19.994 --> 01:04:24.455]  And let's see what they say when they have real legal jeopardy.
[01:04:24.795 --> 01:04:26.856]  Again, the President has the power.
[01:04:28.516 --> 01:04:42.782]  In closing, I've talked to a lot of people and it's not these agencies and groups don't reach out and don't do things for PR purposes.
[01:04:43.362 --> 01:04:45.903]  It's because they're risking their lives even talking to me.
[01:04:48.322 --> 01:05:12.890]  About 80% of the CIA, all the guys that do the killing, the analysts aren't bad either, there have been a lot of them, like Larry C. Johnson and others that have spoken out, but the guys that do the killing are 90% for Trump, 80% of the agency, and it's the big agency obviously, there's 16 others, 15 others, almost the entire Army, most the Marine Corps, most the Navy, most the Air Force,
[01:05:14.023 --> 01:05:15.665]  Not that Trump's even perfect or I'm perfect.
[01:05:15.685 --> 01:05:17.586]  It's that the globalists are so obviously evil.
[01:05:17.986 --> 01:05:20.749]  You've got this Junker, the top Nazi family.
[01:05:21.529 --> 01:05:22.390]  You can't make that up.
[01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.511]  Threatening to break the U.S.
[01:05:23.631 --> 01:05:23.691]  up.
[01:05:24.071 --> 01:05:25.413]  They're making it so clear.
[01:05:26.473 --> 01:05:32.398]  And I'm not even threatening Pelosi and the globalists because they're so arrogant they don't get it.
[01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:36.922]  I don't have some dream like they do of some violent takeover.
[01:05:37.763 --> 01:05:42.206]  But the pit they dig for us, like the Bible says, is the pit they fall in.
[01:05:43.448 --> 01:05:59.443]  And I'm an optimist, I'm also a realist, and I look at everything they've done, all the appeasement of dictators and the rest of it, and I just ask myself, do they have any idea that this way death comes?
[01:05:59.503 --> 01:06:02.826]  Like, they're going down a road that puts people in a corner
[01:06:04.449 --> 01:06:08.932]  That they don't even understand the world they're entering.
[01:06:09.412 --> 01:06:13.154]  And I don't say that like they do with their big fake mafioso smart mouth stuff.
[01:06:13.614 --> 01:06:16.256]  I'm here as a father and a guy that wants to fix stuff peacefully.
[01:06:16.676 --> 01:06:19.558]  And they're saying kill the president, overthrow, arrest everybody.
[01:06:19.978 --> 01:06:26.482]  And I'm like, do you guys understand that for every globalist, somebody
[01:06:27.577 --> 01:06:39.366]  Like the folks we've been interviewing lately, I don't even ask people like Tonto, you know, the big hero of 13 Hours, and people to say, we know what's happening, we're ready to battle the globalists, we're ready to, just give us the word, we're ready to go.
[01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:52.976]  I mean, that's what scares them, is that I talk to folks that are all over the different Special Operations Command, everything, even up to Major Generals, who might have been on the fence before,
[01:06:53.957 --> 01:07:02.387]  They're not for not having prosperity and the Democrats trying to kill prosperity of the Republicans saying we want to bankrupt things to prove Trump's wrong.
[01:07:02.427 --> 01:07:05.110]  That's even getting mercenaries to go, okay, I'm done.
[01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:06.872]  What the hell is your problem?
[01:07:07.032 --> 01:07:12.959]  Because with Trump, it's not some goody two-shoes thing, like he's like some Protestant Bible thumper.
[01:07:13.399 --> 01:07:14.500]  Beating you over the head.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.040]  He's like, let's be rich.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.341]  Let's be powerful.
[01:07:17.721 --> 01:07:24.844]  And then we see it happening only 70 days into office and all these assholes are saying, kill him.
[01:07:25.164 --> 01:07:33.408]  And I'm just like, man, you can't keep shooting your mouth off about violence with people that wrote the book on it.
[01:07:34.215 --> 01:07:37.076]  And so just can you speak about that continuum?
[01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:45.400]  Because I know last time you were on last week, I brought up some of the things we've talked about and just that people knew when they ran for office that they won, what would happen.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.361]  And jokes were made, you know, about putting the army around the White House.
[01:07:48.401 --> 01:07:51.182]  But, you know, that's basically where we're at, Roger.
[01:07:51.222 --> 01:07:52.843]  So they know our phones are tapped.
[01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.344]  They know why they're so scared of Trump.
[01:07:54.864 --> 01:07:58.808]  What does Trump need to do to say stop calling for violent overthrow?
[01:07:58.828 --> 01:08:08.258]  Because, again, it's criminal not to stop major media organizing the criminal overthrow of the executive branch in a civil war.
[01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:10.140]  I don't want a war.
[01:08:10.661 --> 01:08:16.126]  I'm only having to start saying, man, my gloves are coming off, bro, because these people
[01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:17.490]  I don't
[01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:34.122]  I don't want this.
[01:08:54.554 --> 01:08:59.995]  Well, I think the reason they're going crazy, Alex, is because for 30 years they've had it all their way.
[01:09:00.376 --> 01:09:13.219]  They've had total control of the federal machinery, and they've had a willing handmaiden in the mainstream media repeating all the bullshit that they pump out, and they cannot get over the fact.
[01:09:13.599 --> 01:09:14.540]  Let me finish it here.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.481]  George Soros is living in this country.
[01:09:30.595 --> 01:09:35.820]  He has financed people who advocate the murder of the president.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.763]  I don't understand why he has not been arrested.
[01:09:39.783 --> 01:09:40.624]  I want to hear about it.
[01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.545]  They're going to have a committee hearing about it.
[01:09:42.585 --> 01:09:43.226]  Now, exactly.
[01:09:43.826 --> 01:09:50.412]  They can't sit there and call for war and then expect people to never do anything in response to it.
[01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:52.894]  Why do you think the president's been so restrained?
[01:09:53.235 --> 01:09:54.936]  Roger Stone of StoneCulture.com.
[01:09:56.137 --> 01:09:58.239]  Well, I hope it is not because some
[01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:02.753]  Establishment advisors tell him he can't do this and he can't do that.
[01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:16.752]  Having known the president for 40 years, let me tell you, the one thing you don't tell him is that he must do something or that he can't do something because he's his own man and he doesn't take direction from anybody.
[01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:22.378]  He vows to no man in terms of his patriotism and his love of this country.
[01:10:22.879 --> 01:10:25.622]  All he's trying to do is make us great again.
[01:10:26.002 --> 01:10:27.884]  Do you think he's benefiting from this?
[01:10:28.344 --> 01:10:28.905]  Hell no!
[01:10:29.165 --> 01:10:30.627]  This is costing him money.
[01:10:30.987 --> 01:10:32.569]  And he's got to put up with hundreds of millions.
[01:10:38.795 --> 01:10:41.577]  You talk about the fatalism and I've talked to him some like this.
[01:10:42.197 --> 01:10:48.842]  Trump spiritually is so not in some fake Christian establishment stuff, but truly he knows his mission.
[01:10:48.882 --> 01:10:49.842]  He's so dialed in.
[01:10:49.862 --> 01:10:50.703]  He's fatalistic.
[01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:51.984]  That's his strength.
[01:10:52.524 --> 01:10:55.186]  And I wish his people around him would like Bannon gets it.
[01:10:55.866 --> 01:10:58.128]  Let's talk about the fatalism of Donald John Trump.
[01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:06.674]  Look, he understands, uh, and I go back to something, uh, that happened over 30 years ago.
[01:11:06.914 --> 01:11:08.495]  It was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey.
[01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:12.200]  And she said, Donald, do you think you'd ever run for public office?
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.202]  Do you think you'd ever run for president?
[01:11:14.242 --> 01:11:15.523]  He said, no, I don't think so.
[01:11:16.424 --> 01:11:19.546]  Unless things get so bad that I have no choice.
[01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:19.947]  That was it.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.420]  That's why he ran.
[01:11:21.981 --> 01:11:23.501]  He's not in it for himself.
[01:11:23.921 --> 01:11:26.342]  He's not in it because he needs to be somebody.
[01:11:26.362 --> 01:11:28.303]  He already is somebody.
[01:11:28.563 --> 01:11:32.224]  Probably the most famous and successful businessman on the planet.
[01:11:32.864 --> 01:11:43.068]  He's doing this because he believes in the promise of America and he has seen the American dream go down the drain and he's not willing to let it go without a fight.
[01:11:43.628 --> 01:11:45.949]  So I say, God bless the president.
[01:11:46.349 --> 01:11:47.410]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:48.170]  Keep fighting.
[01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:55.134]  I am going to bed because tomorrow I fly to Los Angeles and I will be on with Bill Maher tomorrow night.
[01:11:55.574 --> 01:11:59.696]  And I'm sure he wants to ask me a lot of questions about Russian collusion.
[01:12:00.076 --> 01:12:01.657]  Well, hats off to Bill Maher.
[01:12:01.877 --> 01:12:05.059]  He's got bigger balls than, say, Mark Warner.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.681]  I like Bill Maher and Minnie.
[01:12:07.701 --> 01:12:08.922]  He's faster than I hate him on Minnie.
[01:12:09.202 --> 01:12:12.124]  Not that we need the plug for Bill Maher, but they tape it live.
[01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:13.625]  He hates InfoWars.
[01:12:14.206 --> 01:12:18.089]  So if you don't even want InfoWars plugged, there's nothing we need to travel, you know, the visitors.
[01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:25.034]  We don't get that many of you said it, but just to piss him off, if you said it's an InfoWar, not even InfoWars.com, we're winning.
[01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:27.035]  I want to see if that gets in there.
[01:12:27.055 --> 01:12:28.296]  So promise me you'll do that, alright?
[01:12:29.317 --> 01:12:29.777]  You got it.
[01:12:29.817 --> 01:12:30.738]  You have my promise.
[01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:32.560]  Alright folks, there goes Roger Stone.
[01:12:35.936 --> 01:12:39.698]  You can get his book, which is excellent, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:12:40.239 --> 01:12:41.280]  It's an act of resistance.
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:46.563]  I know you guys and gals already know all this, but other people don't.
[01:12:46.683 --> 01:12:47.403]  They need to read the book.
[01:12:47.424 --> 01:12:48.704]  They need to support us financially.
[01:12:53.127 --> 01:13:00.152]  To me, money is literally like a video game, and I'm fighting the big boss at the end of the game, and I just need more money to beat him.
[01:13:01.232 --> 01:13:02.172]  Money, literally.
[01:13:02.273 --> 01:13:07.175]  I mean, after you've got a good car, like me, I mean, why do I have a Dodge Hellcat?
[01:13:08.455 --> 01:13:10.376]  I've never bought in my life a $63,000 vehicle.
[01:13:10.396 --> 01:13:11.517]  Let's go to full screen.
[01:13:12.017 --> 01:13:13.558]  I don't want to talk to people about money.
[01:13:15.139 --> 01:13:17.300]  I used to drive, like, $25,000 Ford trucks.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:17.960]  They're awesome.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:19.641]  That's all I needed.
[01:13:20.241 --> 01:13:22.502]  But then I was like, Ferrari makes this now?
[01:13:22.682 --> 01:13:24.483]  And it's 700 and something horsepower?
[01:13:25.103 --> 01:13:26.084]  And it's America?
[01:13:27.509 --> 01:13:31.330]  And the owner of the local Dodge thing, he's only getting two of them and he's calling me over.
[01:13:32.531 --> 01:13:33.471]  And I went and test drove it.
[01:13:33.971 --> 01:13:38.633]  And I said, I want this Dodge Hellcat Challenger.
[01:13:40.294 --> 01:13:43.975]  Because it was, you couldn't, you couldn't get a car for $300,000.
[01:13:45.576 --> 01:13:48.497]  You've got to get a half million dollar Ferrari that's as fast.
[01:13:49.137 --> 01:13:50.638]  But it wasn't that I even wanted the fast car.
[01:13:52.847 --> 01:14:00.430]  I had a Ford truck, you know, I still have it that's so fast, 450 horsepower that I mean, it's faster than me.
[01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:18.296]  It was that it was so Americana and so anti-Al Gore, but also because it was black and just looked like a regular Challenger that it like fit into my cosmology that it doesn't look like a race car, but it is.
[01:14:19.496 --> 01:14:22.357]  And the reason I raised that is once you got
[01:14:26.201 --> 01:14:31.805]  Of a car to carry your kids to school, and another car to drive to work in, and a house.
[01:14:31.985 --> 01:14:37.769]  I'm like wanting to downsize from my four bedroom, but I've got a bunch of children.
[01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.570]  I have four children.
[01:14:40.131 --> 01:14:41.812]  Never talked about it on air, but there's four now.
[01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:46.135]  And, because there's so many threats against little sweethearts.
[01:14:51.772 --> 01:14:55.933]  I'm like, you're just going to have to be in the same room as the other because I don't like living in rich people's neighborhoods.
[01:14:56.453 --> 01:14:58.514]  And it's not even against the upper middle class neighborhood I live in.
[01:14:59.114 --> 01:15:00.534]  It just doesn't feel good.
[01:15:01.874 --> 01:15:06.996]  I'm trying to find some big compound, some blue collar area.
[01:15:10.076 --> 01:15:16.218]  And I'm not, it's not like I'm some fake leftist that lives in a rich area and then says that I'm against rich.
[01:15:17.158 --> 01:15:20.539]  I want you to be wealthy, to be independent, but it's not my God.
[01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:26.194]  Like I think I'm gonna sell my car just because I've had it two years.
[01:15:27.054 --> 01:15:28.135]  I don't need something really fast.
[01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:28.975]  I never drive it fast.
[01:15:29.055 --> 01:15:33.118]  I just need to be more humble and just go back to my Ford F-150.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.961]  The point is I'm not doing what I do for money.
[01:15:41.182 --> 01:15:46.565]  I would chop my right arm off right now with a guillotine to defeat the globalist.
[01:15:47.245 --> 01:15:48.806]  Doesn't mean some utopia is coming.
[01:15:49.467 --> 01:15:50.207]  Doesn't mean that
[01:15:54.548 --> 01:15:55.749]  You know, I've got all the answers.
[01:15:55.769 --> 01:15:57.330]  It's just I'm not out to get people.
[01:16:01.233 --> 01:16:12.080]  And again, when you've got the third biggest radio show in the country, the normal talk show host would make $10 million a year or more.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:12.161]  I'm
[01:16:17.412 --> 01:16:25.997]  Gross wise, probably the second highest paid talk show host in the country now, not the third most listened to, but it's listed by talkers and others.
[01:16:26.918 --> 01:16:34.203]  And nobody ever became in the top five, the top ten without being with Clear Channel or Cumulus.
[01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:40.347]  And you've seen the number three or four hosts, you've seen Mike Savage come on and admit, my show's the biggest.
[01:16:40.407 --> 01:16:42.068]  It's not about who's the biggest, folks.
[01:16:43.108 --> 01:16:49.335]  It's about the fact that we're a giant radio slash TV show, but just on terrestrial radio in the top three.
[01:16:50.957 --> 01:16:53.620]  Limbaugh's bigger because he's on all the big establishment biggest stations.
[01:16:53.881 --> 01:16:54.922]  Fine, I don't care.
[01:16:54.942 --> 01:16:56.443]  I don't measure myself by that.
[01:17:00.828 --> 01:17:02.791]  But my greatest pleasure in life
[01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:05.832]  It's not status.
[01:17:05.972 --> 01:17:09.915]  It's in seeing my children and your children in a beautiful world together having a future.
[01:17:10.415 --> 01:17:17.901]  And it's actually sitting back with the wealth of knowledge and success I have at the grocery store wearing a baseball cap and nobody knowing who I am.
[01:17:20.843 --> 01:17:30.451]  And I say that because the New York Times, the Washington Post, all these groups, they would sell their grandma out, as my grandfather used to say, for a stick of bubblegum.
[01:17:32.358 --> 01:17:41.281]  And they just think they're going to be empowered or somehow arrive because they're on the charts or they're in the system.
[01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:53.425]  I was offered a million dollars a year, $3 million, $10 million back when I was only on like 20-something radio stations in the late 90s.
[01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:06.619]  And so I always hear how, oh, I'm a sellout, because some person that actually isn't involved just can feel like a big man by saying, oh, Alex Jones, he's a sellout.
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:10.241]  He works for the system or this, you know, made-up crap or whatever.
[01:18:10.281 --> 01:18:13.183]  We lease a satellite from Clear Channel or AT&T.
[01:18:13.223 --> 01:18:15.265]  We work for them because we lease a satellite.
[01:18:15.305 --> 01:18:17.426]  That's probably a Samsung TV right there.
[01:18:17.706 --> 01:18:18.587]  What company is that?
[01:18:18.607 --> 01:18:18.907]  I don't know.
[01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:19.367]  One of them is.
[01:18:19.747 --> 01:18:20.468]  Work for Samsung?
[01:18:21.308 --> 01:18:21.929]  It is a Samsung?
[01:18:22.915 --> 01:18:23.775]  And it isn't about me.
[01:18:23.935 --> 01:18:25.276]  It's just that I'm just an average guy.
[01:18:25.356 --> 01:18:28.558]  If I can be true and have these effects, you can as well.
[01:18:28.998 --> 01:18:31.479]  And it's the crew and the listeners that make all this possible.
[01:18:32.939 --> 01:18:39.282]  But they're always saying, I'm fake, I'm fake news, I'm a fraud, I'm this, I'm that, when everything I am is truthful.
[01:18:39.723 --> 01:18:44.465]  That's why if I actually want to cuss, which I haven't wanted to do in 20 years, I can't help it.
[01:18:44.485 --> 01:18:46.385]  I'm doing it now on air because I'm so pissed, man.
[01:18:47.786 --> 01:18:49.247]  Things are so clear and
[01:18:50.501 --> 01:19:07.035]  I don't sit here and say, buy our products so that I can like have a bigger house to impress people.
[01:19:07.235 --> 01:19:13.060]  In fact, I want to live in the country and just have a big enough house where when family comes, they got a bed to stay on, not the couch.
[01:19:13.973 --> 01:19:15.454]  And a pool to swim in is like a pool.
[01:19:16.114 --> 01:19:22.058]  You know, a pool, a car, that's... And I can fly somewhere and I can get a cure of medicine.
[01:19:22.499 --> 01:19:24.520]  I just want money to live just like you do.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:25.781]  And the globalists know that.
[01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:32.485]  They want to keep you at a level where you don't get the money you need to live so that you have to capitulate to them to even operate.
[01:19:34.727 --> 01:19:38.590]  So, you know, I bring these things up because money isn't my god.
[01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:39.310]  Money is only...
[01:19:41.169 --> 01:19:46.571]  A means to an end to build an operation so I can expose and fight these people.
[01:19:46.751 --> 01:20:01.877]  And, you know, when they tried to ban the Sex Pistols 40 years ago or whatever it was in the UK, that made them one of the number one bands in the next few years because they banned them.
[01:20:01.917 --> 01:20:03.458]  And nothing against the Sex Pistols.
[01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:08.400]  A few other songs are good, but I've heard local, you know, punk rock bands or stuff that are better.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.380]  I'm not knocking them.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.801]  It's just, you know,
[01:20:13.254 --> 01:20:14.454]  But the point was, it made them huge.
[01:20:14.994 --> 01:20:18.455]  But in this new paradigm, they're saying they want to censor us.
[01:20:18.835 --> 01:20:19.955]  They're shutting us down.
[01:20:20.095 --> 01:20:23.236]  Every week, the last few months, they're just chopping in.
[01:20:24.396 --> 01:20:29.777]  And my lust, and I don't mean that in a bad way, but my drive, my ambition, is to reach new people.
[01:20:32.598 --> 01:20:34.938]  And to pay our crew that work hard more.
[01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:38.019]  And to hire new crew, and to expand.
[01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.720]  And so I used to see the preachers, a lot of them corrupt and bad.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.943]  When I was growing up in Dallas, my parents would drive me to church.
[01:20:48.003 --> 01:20:48.643]  God, I hated it.
[01:20:50.745 --> 01:21:01.774]  Saying like the widow's might, you know, she had nothing, she had some oil and whatever, but her and her daughter were gonna starve to death, but she gave a little bit of money and then, then God gave them all this big bounty because they did it, you know, whatever.
[01:21:03.356 --> 01:21:04.617]  I don't want the widow's might.
[01:21:06.058 --> 01:21:06.478]  Don't want it.
[01:21:09.341 --> 01:21:09.721]  I want,
[01:21:15.486 --> 01:21:15.666]  I think?
[01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:35.955]  You buy water filters, you're not drinking glyphosates and all the other chemicals, hundreds of them.
[01:21:36.355 --> 01:21:39.597]  You buy X2, it changed my life, I know it's real.
[01:21:39.997 --> 01:21:42.198]  You buy bio-tricillinium, it's a game changer.
[01:21:42.558 --> 01:21:50.642]  You buy heirloom seeds that are non-GMO, un-pollinated, you can grow a whole damn forest out of it and it makes no seeds forever.
[01:21:51.283 --> 01:21:53.484]  Everything I do empowers you.
[01:21:54.624 --> 01:22:01.668]  But you have to buy into life and the regenerative process of creativity
[01:22:03.479 --> 01:22:04.960]  To not be part of the satanic system.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:10.903]  And I realized everything I do has to benefit me and everybody involved.
[01:22:12.564 --> 01:22:14.645]  And it's like not some God-fearing thing.
[01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:15.565]  I am God-fearing.
[01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:21.369]  But being God-fearing just means you're in touch with the Creator and the larger plan.
[01:22:21.389 --> 01:22:29.453]  And I'll be honest with you, we know we reach 45 million people a week on a bad week now.
[01:22:30.967 --> 01:22:37.810]  The fact that we bring in the amount of money we bring in, and my crew is impressed with that, it's nothing.
[01:22:38.831 --> 01:22:43.453]  Hell, the Super Bowl has 80 million viewers and brings in 500 million dollars or whatever.
[01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:48.896]  We have that amount of viewers a week, a month, guaranteed, and it's a fraction.
[01:22:49.656 --> 01:22:54.279]  And it's not about the money, but it shows how we're as big as they are bigger.
[01:22:56.766 --> 01:23:08.669]  But we don't have the big corporations and the elite who know they're advertising in a failure, who know they're putting money in that doesn't bring back 10% of what they invest, but they're tithing to prop up their lie.
[01:23:09.009 --> 01:23:11.790]  I was talking to a New York art dealer about a decade ago in New York.
[01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:20.092]  Strangely enough, I was at Trump Tower in a penthouse with one of the heirs of a major restaurant chain.
[01:23:21.433 --> 01:23:25.674]  I'd been out on their big yacht, driving around New York that day after 9-11 at a memorial.
[01:23:28.991 --> 01:23:41.497]  And I said, they were talking about art displays where people would pay $50 million for a skull with some rhinestones on it that somebody with leprosy jacked off on, you know, stuff like that.
[01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:48.201]  And I was like, why would you spend $50 million on something so ugly and pathetic?
[01:23:48.241 --> 01:23:52.063]  And the guy looked at me and he goes, you don't get it, Alex, do you?
[01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:55.701]  That's religious.
[01:23:56.382 --> 01:24:10.668]  The fact that that $50 million could feed hundreds of thousands of African starving children and the fact that they gave it to some weird degenerate artist for a skull with rhinestones, not even real diamonds.
[01:24:11.728 --> 01:24:13.129]  A skull maybe worth $500.
[01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:23.432]  And then they metaphorically gave their seed to death, not to a woman to create life.
[01:24:23.532 --> 01:24:25.373]  It was worshipping death.
[01:24:25.893 --> 01:24:34.597]  It was a death offering, a death cult offering of $54 million, the newspaper, to a semen-covered skull.
[01:24:35.417 --> 01:24:36.518]  And then you understand everything.
[01:24:38.302 --> 01:24:39.463]  And I was like, oh my God.
[01:24:39.483 --> 01:24:40.303]  He goes, oh yeah.
[01:24:41.164 --> 01:24:48.830]  They go and they pay millions a week for art and they go back to their penthouses and they burn it.
[01:24:51.371 --> 01:24:52.192]  He goes, why do they burn it?
[01:24:52.232 --> 01:24:54.374]  I go, because that was money for poor people.
[01:24:54.454 --> 01:24:55.034]  Exactly.
[01:24:56.455 --> 01:24:58.557]  It's as good as killing a kid, killing innocents.
[01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:04.261]  If you can take something and then take $50 million you ripped off from stockholders
[01:25:05.074 --> 01:25:08.236]  And you can buy a skull covered in diseased semen.
[01:25:09.216 --> 01:25:11.138]  And you can worship that skull.
[01:25:12.438 --> 01:25:13.519]  That is so satanic.
[01:25:19.262 --> 01:25:19.502]  See?
[01:25:23.965 --> 01:25:26.246]  And spreading our links, spreading our articles.
[01:25:26.266 --> 01:25:30.629]  I mean, you can Google Wall Street's addiction to
[01:25:32.777 --> 01:25:39.162]  Uh, Degenerate Art was like a Wall Street Journal article, or maybe, was it, uh, New Yorker Magazine, but they make a joke about it.
[01:25:39.422 --> 01:25:40.463]  Oh, look, it's degenerate.
[01:25:40.563 --> 01:25:43.646]  Oh, it's photos of ten-year-olds naked, bound up, beaten.
[01:25:44.106 --> 01:25:45.568]  Oh, it's on Podesta's walls.
[01:25:45.688 --> 01:25:46.308]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:46.328 --> 01:25:47.569]  See?
[01:25:52.193 --> 01:25:54.936]  See, when you study black magic, which I have studied,
[01:25:56.451 --> 01:26:01.756]  The public exhibition of what you're doing gives it more power when you do it.
[01:26:02.176 --> 01:26:09.162]  So you say, oh, we have photos of naked enslaved children on our walls, and we're in the Washington Post promoting our deviant art.
[01:26:12.062 --> 01:26:15.924]  Notice the news said I retracted that Podesta and his family need to be investigated.
[01:26:15.944 --> 01:26:16.564]  I never said that.
[01:26:16.864 --> 01:26:23.508]  I said the pizza place the media focused on has no evidence of that and Alphonso and all that they should be left alone because the media focused on them.
[01:26:23.968 --> 01:26:25.049]  I never recanted anything.
[01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:28.250]  I said I brought up what I said to expose the real stuff.
[01:26:34.714 --> 01:26:36.975]  Let's see, I can't hope for those lawsuits.
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:39.000]  I don't
[01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:08.012]  Married with art and he goes into the paddle, naked kids on their walls.
[01:27:08.393 --> 01:27:09.674]  I just, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:27:09.694 --> 01:27:16.859]  And then when law enforcement, they told us that Podesta, they told us that, uh, what's his name?
[01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:19.501]  Weiner was going to get indicted for child porn.
[01:27:19.561 --> 01:27:20.502]  It came out a month later.
[01:27:20.522 --> 01:27:21.643]  Exactly what they told us.
[01:27:21.783 --> 01:27:24.625]  I mean, I just, I mean, I wonder what's going to happen.
[01:27:24.645 --> 01:27:26.186]  I don't know how they could even have a court case.
[01:27:26.286 --> 01:27:27.748]  CNN was all licking their lips about it.
[01:27:27.848 --> 01:27:30.950]  Oh, Sue Alex Jones for saying pedophilia exists or whatever.
[01:27:30.970 --> 01:27:33.352]  I was just like, do people just like,
[01:27:34.568 --> 01:27:42.152]  They think like... I made retractions because the media started focusing, and then we jumped on it.
[01:27:42.832 --> 01:27:49.636]  People that we can't prove stuff's going on with, and then made up bullshit about, you know, basements and all this that wasn't true.
[01:27:49.656 --> 01:27:51.397]  Then I saw it, I was like, what the hell?
[01:27:51.437 --> 01:27:52.537]  Before I was ever contacted.
[01:27:52.917 --> 01:27:54.878]  Anything, I walk in, I go, what the hell is this?
[01:27:55.619 --> 01:27:58.560]  A menu of half-dead kids, that's not real.
[01:27:59.081 --> 01:28:03.163]  Oh, well it's on the news, and I said, I don't care if it's on CNN, it's bullshit!
[01:28:03.871 --> 01:28:04.491]  Take it down!
[01:28:06.792 --> 01:28:07.672]  That's a honeypot.
[01:28:07.772 --> 01:28:09.773]  My gut knew it was horse shit.
[01:28:11.394 --> 01:28:19.736]  So then I come out and say it's horse crap, December 1st, months before I was sending letters threatening to sue me, and they're like, oh my God, he must be weak.
[01:28:20.197 --> 01:28:24.318]  I'm retracting stuff because all I've got is my integrity.
[01:28:24.338 --> 01:28:28.880]  I'm not worried about money.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.581]  I'm not worried about my name.
[01:28:34.926 --> 01:28:36.267]  I'm worried about the truth.
[01:28:37.567 --> 01:28:38.348]  It's all I've got.
[01:28:39.829 --> 01:28:56.237]  Like Tony Montana says, that archetypal person, but he spent five years in Latin America and Cuba, and his masterwork, he wrote Conan the Barbarian, a great work, and he wrote that film Oliver Stone, Scarface.
[01:28:57.118 --> 01:29:01.680]  And he said, listen man, I only got two things in this world, my word, my balls, and I don't break them for nobody.
[01:29:03.055 --> 01:29:13.342]  And it's like these people that are weasels think that I sit here and open myself up to attack because I'm weak.
[01:29:13.443 --> 01:29:14.363]  It's the opposite.
[01:29:15.544 --> 01:29:17.185]  It's because I'm real.
[01:29:18.526 --> 01:29:21.508]  And I want the return of real people.
[01:29:22.609 --> 01:29:23.310]  Let me tell you something.
[01:29:24.010 --> 01:29:25.271]  Well, I'm gonna end this because the crew's gotta go.
[01:29:25.311 --> 01:29:26.052]  I'm gonna see their families.
[01:29:26.392 --> 01:29:29.114]  I appreciate Marcos Morales and Rob Dewitt and the rest of the crew being here.
[01:29:34.932 --> 01:29:40.314]  The left tells you all day how much they care about you, when they're the ones that want eugenics and death of humanity.
[01:29:40.814 --> 01:29:47.577]  I don't care what color your skin is, or where you came from.
[01:29:49.397 --> 01:29:50.698]  This is fundamental to everybody.
[01:29:51.458 --> 01:30:01.262]  If you got good music, I'm gonna listen to your music whether you're white, whether you're an albino, or whether you're from Mexico, or whether you're from South Africa.
[01:30:06.616 --> 01:30:07.737]  If you've got good food.
[01:30:09.899 --> 01:30:17.865]  I've gone in restaurants owned by ethnic groups that clearly are racist against white people because the food's so damn good in East Austin.
[01:30:22.529 --> 01:30:23.750]  Sorry, I just want the food.
[01:30:26.552 --> 01:30:34.299]  I don't need to sit here and tell you that I'm
[01:30:36.167 --> 01:30:38.188]  Not racist to prove myself to you.
[01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:41.490]  Everything I do is about the people.
[01:30:42.291 --> 01:30:46.413]  Because I'm not a sociopath or a psychopath.
[01:30:46.633 --> 01:30:53.037]  I know metaphysically, and it's been proven with mathematics and everything, that I'm connected to everybody.
[01:30:53.988 --> 01:31:02.315]  Does that mean if they brainwash a bunch of Chinese being brought in, now more than Latin Americans, to hate America and to hate white people, I gotta stand against it?
[01:31:02.995 --> 01:31:05.117]  The Chinese are one of the most racist insular groups there are.
[01:31:05.137 --> 01:31:06.878]  I don't think it's the Chinese, it's a fact.
[01:31:13.904 --> 01:31:18.147]  But I don't hate Chinese people because that's their culture.
[01:31:18.568 --> 01:31:21.430]  If they're individuals that stand for something good and do good things, I love them.
[01:31:24.474 --> 01:31:25.695]  I mean, take Latin Americans.
[01:31:27.036 --> 01:31:37.883]  If you take away their corrupt colonial culture that they ever got out from, on average, they're really cool, smart, neat people who could be very compatible in Western civilization.
[01:31:38.744 --> 01:31:41.866]  I don't dislike Muslims because they've got brown skin, a lot of them.
[01:31:42.486 --> 01:31:44.447]  I dislike them because they're always killing each other.
[01:31:44.788 --> 01:31:45.888]  And yeah, we're killing them too.
[01:31:45.928 --> 01:31:47.269]  The bomb makers want to bomb somebody.
[01:31:47.630 --> 01:31:48.050]  I get that.
[01:31:48.653 --> 01:31:52.874]  I'm not for these wars either, but man, dude, Saudi Arabia is a hellhole, man.
[01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:56.475]  It's like the worst, there ain't no rock and roll on the radio there, baby.
[01:31:56.675 --> 01:31:57.095]  You know what I mean?
[01:31:57.115 --> 01:31:59.536]  You want to bitch about, oh, rock and roll in America in the 50s.
[01:31:59.876 --> 01:32:00.816]  Some Christians got mad.
[01:32:00.836 --> 01:32:01.216]  Yeah.
[01:32:02.177 --> 01:32:05.538]  In Saudi Arabia, they'll kill you if you get caught listening to rock and roll.
[01:32:05.578 --> 01:32:06.758]  If you're gay, you're dead.
[01:32:08.378 --> 01:32:11.479]  I don't care if you're some guy and think you're a woman and you're into that.
[01:32:12.399 --> 01:32:12.859]  What the hell?
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:14.440]  I'm not out to get you.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:21.245]  But I shouldn't have to sit here and explain that to you and then say, by the way, leave my five-year-old alone.
[01:32:22.566 --> 01:32:24.207]  Keep your hands off my five-year-old.
[01:32:24.487 --> 01:32:25.708]  Don't teach them about sex.
[01:32:26.589 --> 01:32:29.031]  I'm gonna teach them about that when they ask when they're 12 years old.
[01:32:30.052 --> 01:32:31.093]  I'm gonna end this broadcast.
[01:32:31.153 --> 01:32:32.494]  Again, great job to the crew tonight.
[01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:34.416]  You guys should come in late tomorrow if you want.
[01:32:43.973 --> 01:32:45.313]  No, no, that's what Stone said.
[01:32:45.813 --> 01:32:47.614]  We announced what CNN was reporting.
[01:32:48.234 --> 01:32:49.434]  In fact, bring the article in.
[01:32:49.454 --> 01:32:51.094]  Just bring a chair in and we can talk about it.
[01:32:52.295 --> 01:32:52.935]  You guys got time.
[01:32:52.955 --> 01:32:53.715]  You gotta go to your wife.
[01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:58.476]  I don't know, Marcos' wife's a nurse and works at night, so he's gotta go.
[01:32:58.496 --> 01:32:58.896]  That's fine.
[01:32:59.176 --> 01:33:00.576]  Just bring it in here.
[01:33:01.476 --> 01:33:01.716]  Yeah.
[01:33:03.157 --> 01:33:04.037]  I was there on 888.
[01:33:04.897 --> 01:33:09.798]  The Olympics were kicking off in China, and Bush, George W. Bush,
[01:33:10.728 --> 01:33:11.789]  I don't know.
[01:33:29.574 --> 01:33:30.075]  Georgia.
[01:33:30.095 --> 01:33:32.637]  So I look at news, it's all there.
[01:33:32.737 --> 01:33:36.701]  I go into work, I go on air and I say Russia has attacked Georgia.
[01:33:37.282 --> 01:33:39.024]  What the hell is their problem?
[01:33:39.404 --> 01:33:40.585]  I'm not in bed with Russia.
[01:33:41.206 --> 01:33:42.487]  Fine, Russia won't be the enemy.
[01:33:42.507 --> 01:33:42.788]  Go ahead.
[01:33:44.827 --> 01:33:49.709]  And then callers start calling and they go, it's actually on this channel and that channel and Der Spiegel and all these other places.
[01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:58.392]  And then I actually go and they admit later, no, Georgia launched attacks at midnight, killing Russians in military bases, overrunning them, attacking.
[01:33:58.812 --> 01:34:01.093]  The Russians came in just to push them out and then stopped.
[01:34:01.753 --> 01:34:05.254]  And John McCain and the usual suspects were on TV calling for nuclear war.
[01:34:05.654 --> 01:34:08.475]  So the Russians rolled nukes in and said, fine, we're ready for nuclear war.
[01:34:10.376 --> 01:34:11.196]  So there's an example.
[01:34:12.336 --> 01:34:13.237]  I go on air.
[01:34:14.195 --> 01:34:16.897]  They put a news article on screen, and the crew's not bad.
[01:34:17.437 --> 01:34:18.098]  I do the same thing.
[01:34:19.018 --> 01:34:22.381]  New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, it's all there, we'll put them on screen.
[01:34:23.061 --> 01:34:25.223]  Yeah, we got Lou Dobbs talking about it, we'll get to it in a minute.
[01:34:25.963 --> 01:34:29.846]  And they say, Michael Flynn asked for immunity, he admits he's a Russian agent.
[01:34:30.592 --> 01:34:32.192]  And I go, wow, okay, Michael Flynn.
[01:34:32.752 --> 01:34:34.733]  And then five minutes later, a bunch of calls.
[01:34:34.773 --> 01:34:36.173]  Go to the articles on Brocker.
[01:34:36.193 --> 01:34:36.873]  Yeah, we put them up.
[01:34:37.053 --> 01:34:38.874]  It was a skeleton crew, like two guys in there.
[01:34:39.614 --> 01:34:42.455]  Five minutes later, Flynn goes, this isn't true.
[01:34:42.495 --> 01:34:51.317]  Just like they said Napolitano had been fired, that he'd been censured for saying this, you know, saying that they were spying on Trump, which is admitted.
[01:34:51.817 --> 01:34:53.317]  So again, this is what we're dealing with, folks.
[01:34:53.337 --> 01:34:57.238]  They've reached, because they know everybody knows they're liars, but still, even I,
[01:34:59.625 --> 01:35:01.186]  If I wake up, it's 5 a.m.
[01:35:01.206 --> 01:35:01.506]  tomorrow.
[01:35:01.546 --> 01:35:02.626]  I usually wake up at 5.30 now.
[01:35:02.866 --> 01:35:06.908]  I usually get up even later, but I usually get up at 8, then 7, then 6, 5.30.
[01:35:07.488 --> 01:35:13.551]  And if I get up and they say, an earthquake hit California, until I drink coffee and, you know, stuff, I'm going to believe it.
[01:35:13.611 --> 01:35:15.132]  Oh God, earthquake, pray for those people.
[01:35:15.592 --> 01:35:16.972]  They'll lie about anything, folks.
[01:35:17.012 --> 01:35:17.633]  That's the point.
[01:35:18.693 --> 01:35:24.736]  Is that Flynn has come out, that was an hour ago when we started, and said, I didn't say that.
[01:35:25.882 --> 01:35:26.866]  And that's what I mean now.
[01:35:27.247 --> 01:35:31.002]  It's like, oh, the Republicans passed a law that your browsing history is public.
[01:35:32.389 --> 01:35:36.733]  No, they had a previous law claiming that, but it gave control over the federal government of your browsing.
[01:35:37.414 --> 01:35:40.056]  And so, the companies are the ones that aren't supposed to give that up.
[01:35:40.357 --> 01:35:41.518]  It's all con games, man.
[01:35:41.878 --> 01:35:42.619]  It's all hoaxes.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:44.701]  I mean, the Republicans did something wrong.
[01:35:44.721 --> 01:35:46.142]  I hate the Republican establishment.
[01:35:46.543 --> 01:35:48.384]  I hate, I mean, I would just say they did it, you know?
[01:35:48.705 --> 01:35:49.786]  They didn't do it!
[01:35:50.086 --> 01:35:53.950]  And then it becomes this, he said, she said, it's like today, I get up.
[01:35:53.970 --> 01:35:55.311]  Then you never know what the truth is.
[01:35:55.571 --> 01:35:57.093]  Well, I can turn your mic on, because I can't hear him.
[01:35:57.433 --> 01:36:02.756]  I get up this morning and I see the headline, Alex Jones says the Jewish Mafia runs the world.
[01:36:03.196 --> 01:36:07.898]  And I went, no, I said there's an Italian Mafia, Mexican Mafia, Dixie Mafia is horrible.
[01:36:08.118 --> 01:36:10.139]  The most powerful Mafia is that they don't call them Mafias.
[01:36:10.159 --> 01:36:12.980]  I mean, in the South there is a white Mafia, let's not lie about it.
[01:36:16.249 --> 01:36:16.630]  I don't know.
[01:36:34.198 --> 01:36:34.758]  It's crazy.
[01:36:35.099 --> 01:36:37.380]  I mean, like, I basically am Hispanic in the food I eat.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.861]  I think Hispanic women are very beautiful.
[01:36:39.161 --> 01:36:40.782]  Probably some of the best looking women out there.
[01:36:41.142 --> 01:36:45.945]  I mean, it's just like, it's like, who I am doesn't even have any currency.
[01:36:46.245 --> 01:36:49.687]  These assholes lie about who I am all day long.
[01:36:50.788 --> 01:36:51.768]  And it pisses me off.
[01:36:51.948 --> 01:36:53.710]  But I know our audience knows that.
[01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:55.531]  We're winning, it's why they're shutting us down.
[01:36:55.811 --> 01:36:57.292]  So, Rob, you've got the Lou Dobbs clip.
[01:36:57.632 --> 01:37:00.614]  I know he's denied it within five minutes of us saying it.
[01:37:00.654 --> 01:37:02.635]  It's just more, it's like when they said,
[01:37:03.914 --> 01:37:04.474]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:37:04.494 --> 01:37:10.278]  And what's crazy is even Lou Dobbs at first, we have a clip of him saying he is looking for immunity.
[01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:14.981]  And then he comes back later and says this, and somebody taped it on their phone, which is the only reason I have this.
[01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:37.633]  So, Flynn's like, of course I'll testify to the committee.
[01:37:38.033 --> 01:37:40.074]  So has Jared Kushner, the son-in-law.
[01:37:40.414 --> 01:37:43.496]  They turned that into he wants immunity, he admits he's a Russian spy.
[01:37:43.636 --> 01:37:43.836]  Right.
[01:37:44.037 --> 01:37:45.577]  I mean, that's what scares me is...
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:52.581]  We're beating him, but you look at Pelosi, you look at Feinstein, you look at Waters.
[01:37:53.101 --> 01:37:57.482]  I mean, I watch their press conferences hoping they sound normal.
[01:37:58.022 --> 01:37:59.343]  Because I got kids, man.
[01:37:59.463 --> 01:38:01.223]  I don't want to have loons running the country.
[01:38:01.583 --> 01:38:03.624]  They don't know what planet they're on.
[01:38:04.344 --> 01:38:10.365]  And so, Rob Dew, I mean, what do you make of that, that they're in control and they want this war?
[01:38:12.017 --> 01:38:12.898]  They're not going to stop.
[01:38:13.078 --> 01:38:13.918]  I can tell you that right now.
[01:38:13.958 --> 01:38:19.822]  They'll just blatantly lie and hope that you accept it and don't even look for anything else other than what they're giving you.
[01:38:20.182 --> 01:38:22.964]  And that's pretty scary because I sent you the thing.
[01:38:22.984 --> 01:38:26.226]  I said, you know, people ask the question, what do you think about Michael Flynn asking for immunity?
[01:38:26.807 --> 01:38:29.228]  And now it turns out it's a total lie, but they just make it up.
[01:38:29.248 --> 01:38:30.429]  They go, we're going to say this.
[01:38:30.929 --> 01:38:32.931]  And when we looked at the browsing history,
[01:38:33.391 --> 01:38:34.572]  Wall Street Journal's reporting it.
[01:38:34.612 --> 01:38:35.652]  New York Times is reporting it.
[01:38:35.853 --> 01:38:40.916]  Everybody's reporting that he's asking for a... And notice before they went fake news... Look at this.
[01:38:41.176 --> 01:38:42.177]  Total fake news.
[01:38:43.998 --> 01:38:46.519]  Wall Street Journal, Fox News, everybody.
[01:38:46.539 --> 01:38:48.140]  So then it comes out that he's not.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.161]  So here's the thing.
[01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:53.784]  They know they're fake news, so they call us fake news.
[01:38:54.344 --> 01:38:55.525]  And they fully committed.
[01:38:57.366 --> 01:38:58.527]  I've studied history, Rob.
[01:38:58.687 --> 01:38:59.787]  I don't think they get out of this.
[01:38:59.807 --> 01:39:02.029]  I don't know what they're going to do after this.
[01:39:04.488 --> 01:39:09.552]  I'm befuddled at this point because I thought I had seen it all until today and they're just keep making stuff up.
[01:39:09.592 --> 01:39:11.974]  Next thing you know, it's like the Jewish mafia thing this morning.
[01:39:12.014 --> 01:39:13.255]  Jews rule the world.
[01:39:14.396 --> 01:39:15.116]  You didn't say that.
[01:39:15.517 --> 01:39:23.182]  I knew when you said the Jews thing, or when you even said the word Jew on the show, they were going to take that out of context.
[01:39:25.925 --> 01:39:26.585]  It's ridiculous.
[01:39:28.526 --> 01:39:31.549]  Here's the thing though, this elite is incompetent.
[01:39:32.734 --> 01:39:36.557]  All they can do is sell us out to the Chinese Communists?
[01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:37.578]  And Islam?
[01:39:37.598 --> 01:39:41.261]  They're like, they hate the country that they got the power from.
[01:39:41.281 --> 01:39:46.846]  Like they're trying to prove something against their big brother, and their big brother's just working in a factory.
[01:39:47.546 --> 01:39:50.209]  While they're like selling out to the biggest killers on earth.
[01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:55.233]  That's it, that's why they flip off communist monuments, victims of communism.
[01:39:55.333 --> 01:39:58.796]  That's why they flip off that monument, because these people have no idea how good they have it.
[01:39:59.355 --> 01:40:02.919]  And they want to destroy the country and think they're going to create some utopia and it's not going to happen.
[01:40:02.939 --> 01:40:10.687]  Meanwhile, every communist or socialist country is in collapse and I don't... I don't even... It's like misery loves company or something because...
[01:40:12.868 --> 01:40:16.009]  Again, it's like paradoxical.
[01:40:16.369 --> 01:40:19.170]  We know things are corrupt, so something good will come along like Trump.
[01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:21.451]  Bad on torture, he backs off on that.
[01:40:21.471 --> 01:40:24.572]  I don't like this fix of Obamacare.
[01:40:24.592 --> 01:40:32.374]  Yeah, it was better than what was there, and I get that it was meant to destroy the economy, but he just thinks if he makes everybody rich or wealthy, or gets the economy going, that'll sell his idea.
[01:40:32.414 --> 01:40:33.635]  So he was like stop gapping it.
[01:40:35.467 --> 01:40:36.168]  They didn't want that.
[01:40:36.328 --> 01:40:37.689]  They want it to fail all the way.
[01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:44.356]  Just so viewers know, it's well known on talk radio that if I was oppositional to Trump, we'd have more listeners.
[01:40:45.037 --> 01:40:48.340]  I mean, people don't want to sit there and hear some cheerleader rah-rah-rah.
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:49.121]  I don't care.
[01:40:49.641 --> 01:40:54.026]  You know, the point is Trump is up against the eight ball and
[01:40:55.788 --> 01:41:05.735]  I feel like in this instant gratification, you know, just on time delivery culture, people don't realize that if we're going through a maelstrom
[01:41:07.259 --> 01:41:10.481]  of a tax, Trump's a hundred times that, literally.
[01:41:10.501 --> 01:41:12.983]  And I'm not bitching about that.
[01:41:13.384 --> 01:41:18.147]  I just, three trillion in the stock market, and the average dumbass goes, oh, I don't own stock.
[01:41:18.868 --> 01:41:27.434]  And I was talking to one of my friends, who is a successful business person in real estate, and I said, isn't the three trillion dollars in the stock market great?
[01:41:27.474 --> 01:41:29.435]  And he said, I don't invest in the stock market, I don't care.
[01:41:29.455 --> 01:41:33.999]  And I said, people buying all your damn houses, and going to restaurants, he owns a restaurant too.
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:35.340]  I said,
[01:41:37.068 --> 01:41:40.471]  You understand that even though it's a big jacked up Ponzi scheme, they were trying to implode it now.
[01:41:41.072 --> 01:41:42.553]  He's doing it for all the major stocks.
[01:41:43.554 --> 01:41:44.935]  That is what makes the economy go.
[01:41:45.655 --> 01:41:48.078]  And the guy went, oh, how can somebody worth?
[01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:50.370]  Probably $10 million.
[01:41:51.150 --> 01:41:57.153]  Not know that the stock market and the middle class and poor people doing better helps them.
[01:41:57.713 --> 01:42:07.598]  There's like this thing where I've got $10 million and I sell off 200 houses a year and I own some restaurants and so I don't care if the stock market goes down.
[01:42:07.638 --> 01:42:10.720]  There's like this, it's like people used to go, oh you must work for an oil company.
[01:42:11.755 --> 01:42:13.317]  You want to turn our coal plants back on?
[01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:46.500]  We went from, I mean I remember family, this is all the old folks to get all the way, I remember family making $100,000 a month, all my cousins, everybody family, like people making millions a year on natural gas and oil like 15 years ago, 10 years ago.
[01:42:47.862 --> 01:42:55.968]  And then now because of coal and the rest of it, it drove it down to nothing, where I have a family that gets like $3,000 a month checks, and then there's property taxes on it.
[01:42:56.368 --> 01:42:57.809]  So I get to be blamed.
[01:42:57.909 --> 01:42:58.289]  Come back, dude.
[01:42:58.329 --> 01:42:58.750]  We can finish up.
[01:42:58.770 --> 01:42:59.170]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:04.494]  I get to be blamed that I'm on the payroll of big oil and natural gas when I get zero money.
[01:43:04.834 --> 01:43:13.080]  And then personally, if I was one of these self-fulfilling assholes that looked at everything in a one-dimensional thing about how do I make money,
[01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:16.262]  I like cheer coal being turned back on.
[01:43:16.282 --> 01:43:19.545]  That's our electricity low, our factories, our jobs, the coal miners.
[01:43:20.145 --> 01:43:24.428]  I cheer the paychecks going from $100,000 to $50,000 to $10,000 to $3,000.
[01:43:24.548 --> 01:43:32.774]  I wouldn't get it anyways, family wise, but the point is, and my family's good with that.
[01:43:33.114 --> 01:43:34.455]  They don't think like parasites.
[01:43:34.995 --> 01:43:37.537]  They're like, wow, we're blessed they found gas and oil on our property.
[01:43:38.778 --> 01:43:41.560]  They're like, God, these property taxes are so high though, we're like losing money now.
[01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:53.674]  But see, literally, they sit there, oh, you work for an oil company, totally ignorant about, do you have family that are petroleum geologists?
[01:43:54.575 --> 01:43:56.435]  Do you have a family that were leasehounds?
[01:43:56.936 --> 01:43:59.497]  Are you from Texas, where the whole oil industry started?
[01:43:59.517 --> 01:44:00.437]  Do you know anything about it?
[01:44:00.797 --> 01:44:02.278]  Most of my family works for oil companies.
[01:44:04.479 --> 01:44:11.562]  And the guys in the oil companies want coal, even though they know it means their jobs, even though they might get paid half.
[01:44:13.018 --> 01:44:17.041]  Well, my dad's uncle, he had five brothers, four brothers, five sons.
[01:44:18.381 --> 01:44:24.726]  The last guy to die a few years ago was a top petroleum geologist.
[01:44:24.746 --> 01:44:29.949]  But like Rex Tillis said, he'd hardly even, he'd like been started on the front line and ran one of the biggest plants in Texas.
[01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:38.034]  I remember him at dinner before he died of pancreatic cancer about five years ago at my house, going, you're doing a great job trying to get coal back home.
[01:44:38.074 --> 01:44:38.955]  America needs it.
[01:44:40.168 --> 01:44:45.427]  And this guy had all these oil stocks, everything else is family, and he was just like, keep pushing for coal for America.
[01:44:52.270 --> 01:45:03.778]  I look at all these people that are nobodies that don't know any of this and you piss on the country and they say Trump's gonna kill America and kill everything because we're gonna have coal that's completely cold.
[01:45:04.118 --> 01:45:05.779]  We have 2,000 years of coal.
[01:45:06.119 --> 01:45:13.524]  It's completely clean and it's almost like God put it there for us because you know Mars had water on it and life on it.
[01:45:13.564 --> 01:45:16.506]  They put it before we did because we were closer to the Sun early on.
[01:45:16.526 --> 01:45:17.447]  We were too hot to have life.
[01:45:17.467 --> 01:45:18.188]  They were further out.
[01:45:19.048 --> 01:45:20.068]  Fourth rock from the sun.
[01:45:20.788 --> 01:45:23.609]  And they found the biology, they found the bacteria on Mars.
[01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:24.389]  It's already been proven.
[01:45:24.769 --> 01:45:26.970]  The churches can't handle it, so they just gloss over it.
[01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:27.570]  This is proof.
[01:45:28.690 --> 01:45:32.011]  But Mars, I'm going to close out and have you finish up, and we're going to end this, and I appreciate you guys staying late.
[01:45:32.831 --> 01:45:42.113]  Mars, because of its lower gravity, it's like two-thirds the size of Earth, whatever, I forget, 60% or whatever it is, it started losing its atmosphere.
[01:45:45.362 --> 01:45:56.114]  And you know the Earth had 500 plus times or more, you can Google it, the number is actually 1,200 times at one point in the Jurassic period, carbon dioxide.
[01:45:56.294 --> 01:46:00.399]  And now not even 1% of the air is carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[01:46:00.759 --> 01:46:05.224]  And we're losing it, and they now know from sensors in space, we're losing the atmosphere.
[01:46:05.865 --> 01:46:09.848]  And it accelerated when they started doing hydrogen bomb tests in the 60s.
[01:46:09.948 --> 01:46:11.449]  Again, who was running our government to do that?
[01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:12.890]  Who are these people?
[01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.371]  I don't know.
[01:46:13.511 --> 01:46:13.751]  I don't know.
[01:46:13.931 --> 01:46:14.792]  It's above my pay grade.
[01:46:15.292 --> 01:46:18.074]  The point is, our atmosphere is leaking out right now.
[01:46:18.454 --> 01:46:19.795]  Plants aren't growing as fast.
[01:46:20.196 --> 01:46:21.957]  Carbon dioxide's been going down.
[01:46:22.377 --> 01:46:24.599]  Al Gore makes a movie how it makes us get hot.
[01:46:24.639 --> 01:46:25.920]  We need to make it go down more.
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:28.922]  And again, it's that fundamental thing.
[01:46:29.002 --> 01:46:31.584]  They make jokes on Saturday Night Live about, he wants coal.
[01:46:31.644 --> 01:46:32.225]  What a joke.
[01:46:33.413 --> 01:46:35.615]  The Martians are attacking, but we have coal.
[01:46:37.616 --> 01:46:39.077]  Yeah, the relentless rise.
[01:46:39.377 --> 01:46:42.279]  But if you look at the last 200 years, 300 years, it's going straight down.
[01:46:42.579 --> 01:46:44.981]  So the graph is like huge and high, but it goes way down.
[01:46:45.261 --> 01:46:50.105]  Then they claim with false sensors it spiked a little bit recently because of human activity.
[01:46:50.125 --> 01:46:55.869]  But if you look at the thousand year graph, in fact, just your search engine, carbon dioxide was
[01:46:57.071 --> 01:46:58.613]  Greenland, it's the Greenland ice cores.
[01:46:58.753 --> 01:47:03.179]  Well, yeah, but it was 1,200 times, but they'll be exactly, but again, they showed you slice the last 50 years ago.
[01:47:03.239 --> 01:47:04.761]  Oh, look, it's boosting right there, right?
[01:47:04.921 --> 01:47:06.383]  But if you look at the whole graph, it's up here.
[01:47:06.403 --> 01:47:09.206]  Well, then they say heat follows it.
[01:47:09.266 --> 01:47:13.231]  No, you get you get heat, then more life, then more carbon dioxide.
[01:47:13.532 --> 01:47:13.672]  Yeah.
[01:47:14.514 --> 01:47:16.535]  But the planet's been in ice ages.
[01:47:16.955 --> 01:47:20.136]  Because the sun, they've proven, is not as hot as it used to be.
[01:47:20.236 --> 01:47:21.256]  It's getting smaller.
[01:47:21.276 --> 01:47:22.937]  These people.
[01:47:22.957 --> 01:47:23.897]  It's the solar activity.
[01:47:24.017 --> 01:47:25.937]  And they've been looking at the solar activity.
[01:47:25.977 --> 01:47:29.218]  It's almost nothing there the last few weeks.
[01:47:29.238 --> 01:47:30.919]  They're like, whoa, what's going on with the sun?
[01:47:30.959 --> 01:47:34.060]  But the UN voted and said the sun has no effect on climate.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:34.260]  Yeah.
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:36.542]  So we just have to bow down and do whatever they say.
[01:47:37.463 --> 01:47:39.424]  And these people are brainwashed everywhere.
[01:47:39.804 --> 01:47:48.772]  And they made it a cult, they made it a religion to worship the earth and worship the fact that humans are bad for the earth and that carbon dioxide is bad.
[01:47:49.693 --> 01:47:52.675]  What we exhale and what plants breathe is bad for the earth.
[01:47:52.695 --> 01:47:53.436]  That's what they're saying.
[01:47:54.097 --> 01:47:56.759]  Oh, but you're just, it's too much carbon dioxide.
[01:47:56.839 --> 01:47:57.820]  We used to have more.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:02.223]  Greenland used to be green and used to not be covered with ice.
[01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:05.391]  And that was back when the Vikings were around.
[01:48:05.691 --> 01:48:08.251]  And that's on National Geographic.
[01:48:08.671 --> 01:48:09.852]  I don't say this to be alarmist.
[01:48:09.872 --> 01:48:14.013]  The real climatologists and astrophysicists say the Earth's dying.
[01:48:15.553 --> 01:48:16.353]  And isn't it crazy?
[01:48:16.433 --> 01:48:22.895]  Right at the point we get technology to survive with energy, we terraform and it actually saves the planet.
[01:48:23.635 --> 01:48:25.276]  That's why I've never seen aliens.
[01:48:25.296 --> 01:48:26.456]  I don't say aliens are real.
[01:48:27.136 --> 01:48:29.797]  But the elites are doing everything you do to kill the planet.
[01:48:31.809 --> 01:48:37.331]  You've got the bound up carbon dioxide of hundreds of millions of years of life.
[01:48:39.052 --> 01:48:44.894]  And now, right when the planet doesn't have that gas, we have an energy source to put it back in the atmosphere.
[01:48:45.254 --> 01:48:46.154]  Why wouldn't we do that?
[01:48:48.675 --> 01:48:49.955]  Who could come up with that, Rob, dude?
[01:48:50.215 --> 01:48:51.376]  Who could come up with that scenario?
[01:48:51.756 --> 01:48:53.657]  These are demonic people that hate humans.
[01:48:54.577 --> 01:48:57.618]  So I can only assume that they're not human, if they don't like humans.
[01:48:59.141 --> 01:49:00.542]  Because I'm human and I want to be around.
[01:49:00.562 --> 01:49:01.542]  I want my kids to be around.
[01:49:01.562 --> 01:49:02.763]  I want my grandkids to be around.
[01:49:02.943 --> 01:49:04.464]  And we're not the ones hurting the earth.
[01:49:04.524 --> 01:49:08.325]  The globalists... Alright, I gotta get... I gotta get the crew home.
[01:49:08.345 --> 01:49:09.586]  We've done about two hours already.
[01:49:09.946 --> 01:49:10.727]  We've done two hours.
[01:49:12.027 --> 01:49:15.689]  We're doing more broadcasts and more because, you know, we're getting shut down.
[01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:16.509]  We're getting curtailed.
[01:49:16.529 --> 01:49:17.450]  We're getting censored.
[01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:18.390]  And you know what?
[01:49:19.111 --> 01:49:26.014]  Just like they wrote hieroglyphics on the walls in Africa and in Mesoamerica and in Europe and in Asia,
[01:49:27.031 --> 01:49:28.791]  They didn't do it on a power trip.
[01:49:28.951 --> 01:49:30.732]  No one would know a thousand years later why they did it.
[01:49:31.032 --> 01:49:39.374]  They did it because they wanted to transfer knowledge, and they appreciated the knowledge they heard around the campfire, so they wanted to put it out in a new way to other people.
[01:49:40.454 --> 01:49:43.435]  And the psychopaths and sociopaths, they think we're chumps, Rob.
[01:49:43.595 --> 01:49:43.815]  Yeah.
[01:49:44.035 --> 01:49:48.797]  Because we care about people, and because we feel interconnected.
[01:49:49.617 --> 01:49:50.717]  And they know we care about the earth.
[01:49:50.737 --> 01:49:54.378]  That's why they use environmentalism to get us to guilt and hate ourselves, because we actually care.
[01:49:55.445 --> 01:49:57.607]  And they've done it to a lot of well-meaning people.
[01:49:57.807 --> 01:49:58.548]  They've duped a lot.
[01:49:58.588 --> 01:50:02.652]  I have a lot of friends who believe in that religion of carbon dioxide's bad.
[01:50:02.672 --> 01:50:04.714]  Well, you realize you can't sell that.
[01:50:05.583 --> 01:50:06.563]  It makes them the hero.
[01:50:07.084 --> 01:50:08.684]  So, that's it for the transmission.
[01:50:09.264 --> 01:50:10.205]  Again, we have Flynn.
[01:50:10.785 --> 01:50:11.846]  He said he'll testify.
[01:50:12.386 --> 01:50:12.986]  Oh, immunity!
[01:50:13.066 --> 01:50:13.986]  That's a criminal.
[01:50:14.907 --> 01:50:15.707]  Just pack of liars.
[01:50:15.747 --> 01:50:17.828]  And it's going to be everywhere tomorrow that he wants immunity.
[01:50:17.868 --> 01:50:18.628]  He wants immunity.
[01:50:18.928 --> 01:50:20.969]  And he's going to say, no, I never asked for immunity.
[01:50:21.789 --> 01:50:22.770]  Shut up, Larry.
[01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:28.112]  They're building towards, I'm not bragging, but did I say hundreds of times they're going to use COG to overthrow Trump?
[01:50:29.152 --> 01:50:29.332]  Yep.
[01:50:29.933 --> 01:50:32.874]  You started getting the bad feeling on election night.
[01:50:35.662 --> 01:50:37.044]  They're not going to stop.
[01:50:37.064 --> 01:50:37.865]  They're going to attack.
[01:50:37.945 --> 01:50:39.947]  I remember you saying that several times that night.
[01:50:43.091 --> 01:50:43.852]  But that's obvious.
[01:50:44.013 --> 01:50:53.524]  The point is, is that COGs, the way they got rogue groups in the government believing they're actually fighting some foreign takeover, and they're now saying kill the president in major publications.
[01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:59.608]  And then all the Republicans that don't go along, they're Russians, and all of us are Russians.
[01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:01.951]  We're not going to supermaxes, okay?
[01:51:02.031 --> 01:51:03.453]  This is what they did to the Davidians.
[01:51:03.994 --> 01:51:07.658]  They demonized them for 51 days, and then they went in and killed them.
[01:51:07.899 --> 01:51:09.401]  And everybody was like, hey, good job!
[01:51:10.041 --> 01:51:10.983]  Got those pedophiles!
[01:51:12.919 --> 01:51:15.101]  And then it comes out later that they weren't that bad.
[01:51:15.121 --> 01:51:18.444]  And they could have arrested this guy at any time.
[01:51:18.464 --> 01:51:19.204]  He knew the sheriff.
[01:51:19.805 --> 01:51:20.465]  He knew everybody.
[01:51:20.786 --> 01:51:23.348]  So they're going to demonize Trump, demonize Trump, demonize Trump.
[01:51:23.368 --> 01:51:26.310]  So even the people who are like kind of on the fence are like, well, maybe Trump is bad.
[01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:28.472]  You know, the news keeps finding stuff about him.
[01:51:28.492 --> 01:51:29.373]  So maybe he is bad.
[01:51:29.713 --> 01:51:40.222]  You know, the sheriff was going to go public because he, I talked to filmmakers that got the Academy nomination and won the big awards.
[01:51:40.362 --> 01:51:41.643]  And then he died a day later.
[01:51:46.291 --> 01:51:48.674]  They killed him because he was going to go public.
[01:52:04.457 --> 01:52:06.998]  And I know the people involved in that were haunted by what they did.
[01:52:07.618 --> 01:52:10.479]  And that's why a lot of things they've done later behind the scenes to try to rectify that.
[01:52:11.199 --> 01:52:17.220]  But that was all a psyop on the military to see if they could get them to turn against the American people.
[01:52:17.401 --> 01:52:20.141]  And also the media did a demonization campaign.
[01:52:20.161 --> 01:52:24.622]  It was meant to turn us against the military so that they would hate us and then they would get their fight.
[01:52:25.043 --> 01:52:26.563]  Instead, we're going to love the military.
[01:52:27.323 --> 01:52:28.684]  We're going to understand what was done to them.
[01:52:28.724 --> 01:52:29.644]  And the military's awake.
[01:52:30.044 --> 01:52:30.864]  But see, exactly.
[01:52:30.884 --> 01:52:33.525]  And 15 years ago I would just get all pissed because I didn't get it.
[01:52:34.673 --> 01:52:38.115]  But now you see the sophistication of reality.
[01:52:39.136 --> 01:52:43.919]  And it took this long for that realization to happen, because you have to have the passage of time to see that.
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:45.180]  That's wisdom.
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:45.601]  Yeah.
[01:52:46.461 --> 01:53:03.413]  So there's three ways to learn, or maybe four, but you can learn through experience, you can learn through education, or you can learn through revelation.
[01:53:04.867 --> 01:53:07.268]  I'd say through your DNA, be the fourth way.
[01:53:07.288 --> 01:53:07.968]  I agree, DNA.
[01:53:08.408 --> 01:53:09.488]  Yeah, exactly, race memory.
[01:53:09.928 --> 01:53:11.348]  So there is always more, exactly.
[01:53:11.928 --> 01:53:12.909]  Instincts, common sense.
[01:53:13.689 --> 01:53:14.629]  So there's common sense.
[01:53:17.770 --> 01:53:19.270]  There's learning.
[01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:21.991]  I'm going to start with the ways you learn.
[01:53:23.491 --> 01:53:25.811]  Well, you have education, like you said.
[01:53:27.232 --> 01:53:29.612]  You have, uh... Experience.
[01:53:29.692 --> 01:53:30.292]  Experience.
[01:53:30.512 --> 01:53:31.072]  Revelation.
[01:53:31.332 --> 01:53:31.573]  Yep.
[01:53:32.253 --> 01:53:33.393]  Which probably is the DNA.
[01:53:34.198 --> 01:53:34.958]  You think that's what it is?
[01:53:35.419 --> 01:53:37.339]  Well, it's spiritual, but yeah, exactly.
[01:53:37.359 --> 01:53:38.200]  That's why you know it.
[01:53:45.162 --> 01:53:46.783]  And you really learn by screwing up.
[01:53:48.364 --> 01:53:49.004]  That's how you learn.
[01:53:49.384 --> 01:53:50.305]  That's one of the biggest ways.
[01:53:50.325 --> 01:53:51.545]  The best way is to learn.
[01:53:53.086 --> 01:53:54.166]  So let me ask you this question.
[01:53:57.687 --> 01:53:58.668]  The listeners out there.
[01:54:00.382 --> 01:54:01.263]  I'm not mad at the listeners.
[01:54:01.283 --> 01:54:02.103]  They're amazing folks.
[01:54:02.123 --> 01:54:02.743]  They support us.
[01:54:03.524 --> 01:54:06.825]  They have to understand, as we get censored, they're being censored.
[01:54:07.046 --> 01:54:12.809]  As all this happens, we know where this goes historically, Rob.
[01:54:13.169 --> 01:54:17.951]  In your gut, where do you think the country is, Infowars, Trump, is in a year?
[01:54:18.752 --> 01:54:21.233]  Because things are moving quick.
[01:54:22.521 --> 01:54:28.006]  One year, I think we're going to be putting out more stuff, but it's going to be bottlenecked, like it is now.
[01:54:29.007 --> 01:54:30.508]  I'm watching the bottlenecks happen daily.
[01:54:31.169 --> 01:54:32.490]  And I think it's only going to get worse.
[01:54:33.010 --> 01:54:34.131]  We're looking at other platforms.
[01:54:34.171 --> 01:54:35.473]  Other platforms are being created, though.
[01:54:35.773 --> 01:54:39.456]  So as people try to push stuff down, it's going to be this effect of a balloon.
[01:54:39.636 --> 01:54:42.419]  And as YouTube gets censored, people are going to go to other platforms.
[01:54:43.410 --> 01:54:45.594]  And as Facebook gets censored, people are going to go to other platforms.
[01:54:45.614 --> 01:54:52.767]  There's already an alternative Twitter that's gaining steam, even though Apple or Android is blocking it out of the store.
[01:54:53.608 --> 01:54:54.129]  But it's happening.
[01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:55.271]  People are going to create alternatives.
[01:54:57.048 --> 01:54:59.030]  That's right, they're like, we don't like email, create a Twitter.
[01:54:59.230 --> 01:54:59.410]  Yeah.
[01:54:59.470 --> 01:55:01.112]  We don't like these other video sites, create a YouTube.
[01:55:01.352 --> 01:55:08.619]  They admit it's to create a, like, false web that we all go to and then they can control it and control us because we would have already won.
[01:55:08.639 --> 01:55:10.440]  Yeah, they're like, come on in, it's free, come on in.
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:13.944]  I mean, I knew election week when we had 80 plus million viewers conservatively.
[01:55:13.984 --> 01:55:14.164]  Yeah.
[01:55:14.604 --> 01:55:16.026]  I mean, I knew they were coming at us.
[01:55:16.046 --> 01:55:19.889]  Six million in one day, just on one YouTube channel.
[01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:20.790]  In one day.
[01:55:21.471 --> 01:55:22.832]  Well, Rob, that's just our main channels.
[01:55:25.673 --> 01:55:27.434]  Sure, but that doesn't happen all in one day.
[01:55:27.674 --> 01:55:29.674]  That was one day of broadcast.
[01:55:29.995 --> 01:55:31.555]  Plus the forward slash show.
[01:55:31.695 --> 01:55:32.956]  Plus we were going on Facebook.
[01:55:33.516 --> 01:55:35.116]  Plus it was going over the radio.
[01:55:36.677 --> 01:55:37.497]  Let's be conservative.
[01:55:37.857 --> 01:55:39.818]  It was like, what is it, 84 million in one week?
[01:55:40.178 --> 01:55:40.378]  Yeah.
[01:55:40.598 --> 01:55:41.919]  That's on our own platforms.
[01:55:43.442 --> 01:55:44.303]  That they can't censor.
[01:56:02.412 --> 01:56:04.073]  She's an old ugly bitch and she loves you.
[01:56:04.093 --> 01:56:08.016]  We're going to do some new websites for you, but just spread those links, folks.
[01:56:08.036 --> 01:56:09.157]  We're doing the best job we can.
[01:56:09.497 --> 01:56:11.458]  All right, I want to thank the whole crew for coming in.
[01:56:11.498 --> 01:56:12.559]  What, two and a half hours here?
[01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:13.280]  Two hours?
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:14.821]  Yeah, a little over two hours, I think.
[01:56:15.221 --> 01:56:18.263]  So, Wild Horses Good and Reckless, the way you're doing shows live every day.
[01:56:18.323 --> 01:56:18.483]  Yeah.
[01:56:19.144 --> 01:56:20.905]  And, you know, we're just beta testing.
[01:56:20.925 --> 01:56:25.668]  We're going to get some new hosts in, and we're going to put every bit of sail on we can.
[01:56:25.688 --> 01:56:28.891]  You know, the old day sailing ships, trying to catch as much wind as we can.
[01:56:29.711 --> 01:56:30.752]  Because, I mean, hell, shit.
[01:56:31.252 --> 01:56:32.473]  I started out on access television.
[01:56:33.053 --> 01:56:35.695]  And I've been fired off radio stations for criticizing the government.
[01:56:36.335 --> 01:56:37.536]  So, I've already been down this.
[01:56:37.656 --> 01:56:47.182]  And the exciting thing is, every time we face real, bonafide censorship, it's not just the listeners figure it out and spread the word, but it's like doors just fly open.
[01:56:47.202 --> 01:56:47.902]  It's the vibe.
[01:56:47.922 --> 01:56:51.664]  It just goes... And things start happening.
[01:56:52.645 --> 01:56:54.806]  Other people decide, you know what, I gotta step in.
[01:56:55.867 --> 01:56:56.888]  That's usually how it happens.
[01:56:58.068 --> 01:56:59.069]  People get pushed so far,
[01:57:01.314 --> 01:57:02.855]  And at some point they go, I've had enough.
[01:57:03.376 --> 01:57:05.538]  I mean, what's your line in the sand?
[01:57:06.358 --> 01:57:07.680]  How many times has Alex asked that?
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:08.520]  What's your line?
[01:57:08.881 --> 01:57:15.366]  When are you going to go, I've had enough, I'm done, I'm going to start stepping forward instead of taking a step back?
[01:57:16.367 --> 01:57:26.156]  And being intimidated by MSM or some dweeby who's a total coward on Facebook or is probably a sockpuppet bot, calling you a racist, it's like,
[01:57:27.392 --> 01:57:32.075]  I say Nazis are horrible, working with the Jewish Mafia to kill Jews in World War II, George Soros.
[01:57:32.516 --> 01:57:34.257]  It's like Pulitzer Prize books on it.
[01:57:34.757 --> 01:57:36.939]  And so the Jewish newspapers say I'm anti-Semitic.
[01:57:37.859 --> 01:57:39.581]  They're the ones discrediting themselves.
[01:57:39.661 --> 01:57:40.541]  I feel sorry for them.
[01:57:40.561 --> 01:57:40.881]  Yeah.
[01:57:41.342 --> 01:57:44.684]  It's not like I have to sit there like, oh my God, don't call me a name.
[01:57:45.224 --> 01:57:51.229]  They're the ones like, who have dementia that are basically eating their own crap.
[01:57:51.269 --> 01:57:55.892]  I mean, I don't even, you know, I don't take pleasure in the fact that they're doing it, but it just doesn't matter.
[01:57:57.853 --> 01:58:12.678]  Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[01:58:27.059 --> 01:58:28.020]  All right, two hours plus.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.621]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:58:29.641 --> 01:58:31.562]  All right, we can start a little bit later tomorrow.
[01:58:31.582 --> 01:58:32.923]  Not me, I'm kicking off at 11 a.m.
[01:58:32.943 --> 01:58:33.283]  Central.
[01:58:33.764 --> 01:58:35.305]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:58:35.785 --> 01:58:37.186]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[01:58:37.746 --> 01:58:40.048]  And there's a lot more breaking news as it unfolds.
[01:58:40.068 --> 01:58:43.210]  We'll keep tracking the corporate, the loveless media in its death throes.
[01:58:43.590 --> 01:58:45.111]  So thank you all for watching.
[01:58:45.151 --> 01:58:45.732]  Now take action.
[01:58:46.704 --> 01:58:52.868]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:58:53.248 --> 01:58:56.130]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:58:56.450 --> 01:59:01.673]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:59:02.093 --> 01:59:08.057]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:59:08.197 --> 01:59:11.319]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:59:11.499 --> 01:59:12.920]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:17.263]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:59:17.463 --> 01:59:20.326]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:59:20.406 --> 01:59:22.007]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:59:22.087 --> 01:59:25.270]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:27.892]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:59:28.152 --> 01:59:29.113]  It's in powder form.
[01:59:29.213 --> 01:59:31.895]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:59:31.915 --> 01:59:32.695]  I take this.
[01:59:32.796 --> 01:59:34.497]  This is the product that I take.
[01:59:34.617 --> 01:59:36.579]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:59:37.399 --> 01:59:38.179]  We fight the Globals.
