[00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:02.718]  I'm ashamed right now as a man.
[00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:15.184]  The left's always telling me, be ashamed that you're a man, that all men are rapists, and that the male part of the human species is bad.
[00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:16.565]  I'm like, oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:16.965]  Shut up.
[00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:29.331]  But then I listened to an NPR report, and I've got the transcript right here, of them endorsing Bernie.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.221]  Writing an essay for a newspaper?
[00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.963]  About how he dreams of women bound and tied up being raped?
[00:00:40.203 --> 00:00:45.165]  And then Avenatti says on The View and on other shows, I dream of women in handcuffs?
[00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:47.626]  All of my sexual fantasies involve handcuffs.
[00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:52.588]  These people aren't liberals.
[00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:55.229]  They're psychotic control freaks.
[00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:01.218]  I'm a father of three daughters and a son.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.542]  And I've never seen conservatives or patriots or Christians attacking women like this.
[00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:15.067]  But I see the left ally with radical Islam that literally attacks female rights at its core.
[00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:17.429]  But I get it.
[00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.193]  If you're going to attack the goddess and the archetype, you've got to claim you are the protector of it.
[00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:26.455]  And think about how sick that is.
[00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:37.356]  Here is the NPR article with the production, the show they did, that you've got to listen to, man.
[00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:39.697]  Them trying to defend this is incredible.
[00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:45.499]  The Bernie Sanders rape fantasy essay explained.
[00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:52.842]  When I saw this earlier today, I saw Owen Schroeder on air covering it, and I thought, is that a joke?
[00:01:53.203 --> 00:01:54.603]  He goes, no, here's the NPR article.
[00:01:55.463 --> 00:01:56.464]  I went and listened to it.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.940]  I'm overwhelmed right now.
[00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:06.862]  He fantasizes about tying women up and raping them.
[00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:13.565]  And he's got every Islamic and every liberal woman just bowing down.
[00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:15.005]  It's like the pimping.
[00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:15.526]  It's true.
[00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.086]  You treat women great.
[00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:18.507]  You empower them like America did.
[00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:19.287]  America sucks.
[00:02:20.127 --> 00:02:23.428]  You're a dirty communist that talks about all these three things.
[00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:24.669]  I'm going to rape you.
[00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:31.312]  Most women don't love it, but leftist women do.
[00:02:32.092 --> 00:02:34.153]  Folks, you've got to go read these quotes.
[00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:35.454]  You've got to go listen to it yourself.
[00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:37.455]  We'll post this and put links under it.
[00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:38.556]  I'm not going to play the clips here.
[00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:43.298]  A man goes home and masturbates.
[00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.159]  His typical fantasy?
[00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.700]  A woman on her knees.
[00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.161]  A woman tied up.
[00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:50.522]  A woman abused.
[00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.631]  Funny, Bernie, I never had that fantasy.
[00:02:54.671 --> 00:03:01.473]  I thought about a woman loving me, and wanting to embrace me, and jumping on me, and loving me, and us enjoying each other, and like, together.
[00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:04.214]  I never thought about her tied up on her knees, man.
[00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:12.256]  A woman enjoys intercourse with a man as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously.
[00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:17.717]  No, dude, that's your freaked out, crazy, inbred, globalist brain, man.
[00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:19.518]  That's not what women are fantasizing about.
[00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:27.214]  The man and woman get dressed up on Sunday, go to church, or maybe to a revolutionary political meeting.
[00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:32.917]  Have you ever looked at a stag man hero through magazines on the shelf of your bookstore?
[00:03:33.697 --> 00:03:39.940]  Do you know why the newspaper with the articles like, girl 12 raped... Girl 12 raped?
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.401]  Girl 12 raped by 14 men sold so well.
[00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:45.502]  I never read that.
[00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:46.902]  I didn't know that sold so well, Bernie.
[00:03:46.922 --> 00:03:48.623]  I don't know what bookstores you go to.
[00:03:48.643 --> 00:03:50.424]  I don't know how you do it up there.
[00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:57.082]  Soviet Russia were your honeymoon, but here in America, we put our women on a pedestal and we don't rape them.
[00:03:58.383 --> 00:04:04.551]  But I get it, you're all about raping freedom and raping America and raping colleges you take over and just con them.
[00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.474]  You have this satanic belief you're gonna rule us, Sanders.
[00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:08.275]  You're not.
[00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:09.137]  You're gonna...
[00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:13.345]  Who cares about the Congress?
[00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:15.886]  Who cares about the separation of powers?
[00:04:16.186 --> 00:04:19.368]  Who cares about the Constitution of the President?
[00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:21.528]  I'm the President of the United States.
[00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:22.709]  I have all of the power.
[00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:29.872]  So here's your God, Sanders supporters, dreaming about raping women.
[00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:30.612]  It goes on and on.
[00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:37.735]  And then Biden's like French kissing his nieces and acting like a psychotic goblin.
[00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:43.326]   I mean, The tolerance of good people of evil has brought us to this point.
[00:04:45.047 --> 00:04:53.071]  And so like they say in V for Vendetta, if you want to know who's behind all this, just look in the mirror.
[00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:59.774]  There are those that are more responsible and they will be dealt with.
[00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:02.634]   But if you want to know who's behind all this just look in the mirror.
[00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:06.432]  I want a clean break with you people.
[00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:11.434]   Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:13.323]  They will be held accountable.
[00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:19.289]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:21.892]  I know why you did it.
[00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:23.534]  I know you were afraid.
[00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:24.555]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:26.944]  War, terror, disease.
[00:05:26.944 --> 00:05:32.783]   There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[00:05:32.783 --> 00:05:33.783]  common sense.
[00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:39.185]   Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam
[00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:40.185]  Sutler.
[00:05:40.185 --> 00:05:45.584]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent,
[00:05:45.584 --> 00:05:46.584]  obedient consent.
[00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:57.225]   I go to these Democrat events, these Bernie Sanders events, and I see how dehumanized
[00:05:57.225 --> 00:05:58.225]  and how destroyed they are.
[00:05:58.225 --> 00:05:59.384]  It just depresses me.
[00:05:59.384 --> 00:06:04.983]   I don't feel powerful at how devoid and divorced from humanity they are.
[00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:09.225]  And I look at the head of the Young Terds, Saint Andrew.
[00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:19.225]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:13.693]  And how he like worships and praises raping animals.
[00:06:13.693 --> 00:06:16.693]   And it's just like, the left's like, "Raping animals is good.
[00:06:16.693 --> 00:06:18.391]  It's a freedom we have."
[00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:21.193]  And then they endorse NAMBLA, they endorse bestiality.
[00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:21.992]  I'm like...
[00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:33.592]   If I were the benevolent dictator of the world, I would legalize bestiality where you are giving...
[00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:35.793]  where you are pleasuring the animal.
[00:06:35.793 --> 00:06:37.213]  Have we lost our soul?
[00:06:37.307 --> 00:06:38.808]  Do we not have our humanity anymore?
[00:06:39.288 --> 00:06:40.448]  Can we not say no to this?
[00:06:40.788 --> 00:06:50.111]  And then I see info wars that was right about the coronavirus being manmade and right about Trump was going to win and right about vaccines being dangerous and right about fluoride being bad.
[00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:51.571]  And I see how we're censored.
[00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:53.252]  And it's not that I'm mad that we're censored.
[00:06:53.832 --> 00:06:58.653]  I'm mad that more people out there put up with this than those that fight back against it.
[00:06:59.073 --> 00:07:03.216]  When clearly the pro-human initiative is strong and has a good vision.
[00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:08.640]  And our inclination as humans is to be upwardly mobile and do incredible things.
[00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:17.086]  But we give ourselves over to the power of the media and the corporate system that intimidates us and threatens us if we don't serve it.
[00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:20.189]  The threat is submitting to it.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.763]  The great battle, the great empowerment is fighting it.
[00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:28.165]  And the fight lives at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:30.087]  We fight for humanity.
[00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:31.368]  We fight for justice.
[00:07:31.408 --> 00:07:32.228]  We fight for life.
[00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:34.230]  We fight for a pro-human future.
[00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.231]  We fight.
[00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:37.372]  I'm the President of the United States.
[00:07:37.492 --> 00:07:38.553]  I have all of the power.
[00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:43.737]  Joey, we have something here for our special visitors.
[00:07:43.757 --> 00:07:44.698]  Would you like to have it?
[00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:46.005]  Thank you!
[00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:47.286]  Thanks a lot!
[00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:48.067]  Sure.
[00:07:48.307 --> 00:07:49.568]  You ever been in a cockpit before?
[00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:50.388]  No, sir.
[00:07:50.488 --> 00:07:52.530]  I've never been up in a plane before.
[00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.232]  You ever seen a grown man naked?
[00:07:55.952 --> 00:07:57.213]  Paula, who said they like Coke?
[00:07:57.253 --> 00:07:57.373]  Me!
[00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:58.734]  Alright, you tell me about them.
[00:07:58.754 --> 00:07:59.515]  I like Coca-Cola.
[00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:00.655]  Oh, Coca-Cola.
[00:08:00.775 --> 00:08:03.017]  Alright, but who knows about cocaine?
[00:08:03.197 --> 00:08:04.258]  Anyone ever seen cocaine?
[00:08:05.138 --> 00:08:07.380]  Yes!
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:07.820]  Hold it.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.400]  One at a time.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.141]  What about cocaine?
[00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:09.701]  Good thing?
[00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:10.202]  Bad thing?
[00:08:10.262 --> 00:08:10.442]  What?
[00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:10.842]  Joey!
[00:08:10.862 --> 00:08:14.044]  You ever hang around the gymnasium?
[00:08:14.224 --> 00:08:14.965]  Sujia smokes.
[00:08:16.482 --> 00:08:17.823]  Let me hear, come on, raise your hand.
[00:08:18.683 --> 00:08:20.504]  Well, other than your parents, who smokes?
[00:08:20.524 --> 00:08:21.044]  Me.
[00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:21.865]  You got your smoke ready?
[00:08:21.945 --> 00:08:23.906]  I've seen a lot of kids with 12 and 11 smoking.
[00:08:24.106 --> 00:08:24.907]  I don't smoke.
[00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:25.507]  Alright.
[00:08:25.767 --> 00:08:28.108]  I don't smoke because I'm a little kid.
[00:08:28.328 --> 00:08:30.109]  I'm only 5 years old.
[00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.572]  Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?
[00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:44.915]  Keith Bansimer powers the great line of high-quality storable food we have available at ReadyHour and InfoWareStore.com.
[00:08:45.155 --> 00:08:46.757]  And yes, we're selling storable food here.
[00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:51.324]  What concerns me is we're a month into this and food sales aren't going down, they're going up.
[00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:52.785]  You've never seen anything like this.
[00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.527]  Never, never like this, and sustain.
[00:08:55.627 --> 00:09:00.750]  You know, it started, you know, 27 days ago, and it kind of went hyper, and it doesn't fall off.
[00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.331]  And in even recent days, you know, it's further increasing.
[00:09:04.372 --> 00:09:08.734]  The semis are rolling, the chips are in, we're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[00:09:08.754 --> 00:09:11.055]  Orders that are getting in today, they're gonna ship.
[00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:13.016]  They're gonna just ship in 10 to 14 days.
[00:09:13.036 --> 00:09:14.597]  We're helping people prepare.
[00:09:14.777 --> 00:09:16.457]  It's just something you cover.
[00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:17.098]  Absolutely.
[00:09:17.118 --> 00:09:19.459]  I like to eat daily, and so we're just backing that up.
[00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:21.020]  It's the best insurance out there.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.325]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now at today's prices.
[00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:29.008]  It's normal to sit on top of horrible food and guns.
[00:09:29.189 --> 00:09:30.150]  All our forebears did it.
[00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.110]  We've got food.
[00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:32.071]  We've got guns.
[00:09:32.252 --> 00:09:33.153]  We've got Jesus.
[00:09:33.233 --> 00:09:34.053]  We know how to use it.
[00:09:34.134 --> 00:09:35.455]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex.
[00:09:35.535 --> 00:09:36.176]  It's real simple.
[00:09:36.456 --> 00:09:37.417]  Noah prepared.
[00:09:38.638 --> 00:09:39.378]  Real stuff, man.
[00:09:39.418 --> 00:09:40.559]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:46.021]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:48.243]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[00:09:48.923 --> 00:09:50.424]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:53.845]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:57.647]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[00:09:58.027 --> 00:09:58.967]  Twenty different stickers.
[00:09:59.507 --> 00:10:00.728]  Impeach the Democrats.
[00:10:01.128 --> 00:10:02.168]  Save the Second Amendment.
[00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:03.229]  Defend the First Amendment.
[00:10:03.289 --> 00:10:04.249]  Infowars.com.
[00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:05.969]  And it looks like duct tape.
[00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:06.770]  It's just a regular sticker.
[00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.610]  You put it over your mouth.
[00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.950]  You go to a Trump rally.
[00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.511]  And you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:12.752]  People say, why are you doing this?
[00:10:13.132 --> 00:10:13.652]  What's happening?
[00:10:13.672 --> 00:10:15.172]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[00:10:15.192 --> 00:10:17.373]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:20.534]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[00:10:20.814 --> 00:10:21.194]  Brilliant.
[00:10:21.595 --> 00:10:28.403]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[00:10:28.683 --> 00:10:31.446]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[00:10:31.646 --> 00:10:33.849]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[00:10:34.469 --> 00:10:35.471]  Silence.
