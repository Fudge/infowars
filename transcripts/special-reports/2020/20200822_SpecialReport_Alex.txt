[00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:05.424]  You may have tried to close Martin Springs, but it's open!
[00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:09.685]  Because we, the people, are opening it!
[00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:18.966]  Yeah!
[00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.727]  It's North Korea, this is Texas!
[00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:22.387]  Yeah, Texas!
[00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:29.207]  USA! USA! USA! USA!
[00:00:29.207 --> 00:00:31.207]  [Chanting] USA! USA! USA!
[00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:32.162]  USA!
[00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:35.164]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is tyranny!
[00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:55.860]  That's what it's like to live in Communist China or Soviet Russia, where they arbitrarily want to tell you that you can't go use that park, all to show you that you're slaves, all to show you that you're garbage, all to make you submit.
[00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:57.908]  Hey lifeguards!
[00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.151]  Are you guarding our liberty and freedom?
[00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:06.260]  Or are you proud of how they shut down Martin Springs just because we were coming here today?
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.943]  Are you proud of being tyrants?
[00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:19.376]  The left doesn't want any walls to the border, but they want to put up walls to your parks and tell you can't come in them, because they're part of a nasty cult of sick, evil control freaks.
[00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:22.859]  This COVID takeover is a total end of America.
[00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.521]  The whole thing's a fraud, and it's disgusting.
[00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:29.165]  And we will fight your evil commies all over Austin.
[00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:31.704]  and you try to steal our land? You scum!
[00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:42.704]  [Music]
[00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:50.705]  [Music]
[00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:52.705]  [Music]
[00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:54.705]  [Music]
[00:01:54.705 --> 00:02:00.705]  [Music]
[00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:03.705]  This is pure evil, this is a crime!
[00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:04.705]  It is your right to resist!
[00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:06.705]  You're not well met!
[00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:08.705]  Stand up for your creator!
[00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:18.705]  [Cheering]
[00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.172]  Alex!
[00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:23.075]  Come on Alex!
[00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:23.475]  How?
[00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:23.996]  How?
[00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:24.777]  USA!
[00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.501]  (laughs)
[00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:31.501]  Ow. Ow.
[00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:38.501]  USA! USA! USA! USA!
[00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:47.501]  (cheering)
[00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:50.062]  America is real to Bill Gates!
[00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.106]  Fuck you!
[00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:53.086]  Yeah!
[00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.086]  [Screaming]
[00:02:56.086 --> 00:02:58.086]  [Music]
[00:02:58.086 --> 00:03:17.086]  [Music]
[00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:20.132]  This is an illegal fence.
[00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:23.054]  This is part of our waterway.
[00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:26.016]  And yes, I am Batman.
[00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:31.099]  This is an illegal waterway.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.462]  Illegal fence to our waterway under Texas law.
[00:03:37.163 --> 00:03:38.764]  And hey guys, we love you.
[00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:52.296]  Thank you for protecting our lives.
[00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:53.116]  Thank you, sir.
[00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:54.937]  Sir, there's a copy up there.
[00:03:55.884 --> 00:03:59.786]  So you've got to call the game boy?
[00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:02.606]  if they are held under civil law grants.
[00:04:02.606 --> 00:04:08.606]   The Riparian Orders do not prevent the public from gaining access to the river
[00:04:08.606 --> 00:04:13.606]   by means of a highway right of way by erection of a fence,
[00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:17.605]   by the erection of a fence, by the erection of a fence,
[00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:23.621]   by the erection of a fence, They're on and cannot prevent the public from going up and down!
[00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:35.591]  Cannot prevent the public from going up and down the river in boats and fishing in its waters by the erection of fences across the river!
[00:04:37.452 --> 00:04:39.734]  What part of that do you not understand?
[00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:41.916]  Okay, let me hold that, let me hold that.
[00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:46.706]  Will you record this?
[00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:47.147]  Yes, sir.
[00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:49.530]  You guys are having fun, right?
[00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:52.034]  You guys are having fun, really?
[00:04:52.294 --> 00:04:52.675]  Come on.
[00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:54.317]  It's better than what you could be doing.
[00:04:54.378 --> 00:04:57.722]  Hey, here's what I'm going to say about what's happening right here.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:09.129]  All around the country, we have seen police officers take a knee for riot mobs that want to defund them and call for their deaths in the street.
[00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.992]  Now, it may not be today.
[00:05:13.672 --> 00:05:27.364]  It may not be today, but one day, our great men in blue, that we support and love so much, one day, our great police officers will realize, you don't need to take a knee for us, you need to stand with us!
[00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:41.064]  And though that day may not be today, someday our great men in blue will realize who are their allies and who literally wants them defunded and dead.
[00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:49.245]  And so we came over here, and this is our peaceful protest, to swim in waters that legally belong to us!
[00:05:50.406 --> 00:06:15.442]   And so it may not be today where the police decide to stand for freedom, and stand for the Constitution, and stand for the Bill of Rights, and stand for the United States of America, but someday in the near future, If we continue to execute our rights peacefully and we continue to show them that we have their backs and we're in this together, someday they will stand with us and someday they will take down the fence that blocks us from being free!
[00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:25.568]  And so, I hope that the lifeguards here and the police one day will join us in one big USA!
[00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:31.267]  >>U.S.A.!
[00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:35.868]  >>U.S.A!
[00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:36.868]  >>U.S.A.
[00:06:37.754 --> 00:06:38.875]  USA!
[00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:44.398]  So I guess the Democrats want to keep us from being free in this city.
[00:06:44.418 --> 00:06:47.079]  The Democrats want to keep us from being able to breathe.
[00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.141]  The Democrats want to keep us from being able to swim in our own public waters.
[00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:56.724]  And the Democrats want to defund the police who they make enforce all their dictatorship laws.
[00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:05.522]  And one day very soon, my friends, this big charade is going to come to an end.
[00:07:06.523 --> 00:07:08.524]  This big charade is going to come to an end.
[00:07:09.144 --> 00:07:17.370]  And they, the enemies of freedom and the enemies of America, better hope that we get our justice and we get our vengeance.
[00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.392]  Otherwise, it's going to be God and they don't want that.
[00:07:24.495 --> 00:07:26.136]  Stop following this fraud!
[00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:29.309]  Stop going along with the globalists!
[00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:31.029]  Stop bowing to them!
[00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.170]  And no to their forced inoculations!
[00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.471]  That's right, we're not taking the shots!
[00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:38.893]  We're not taking their deadly vaccines on record and sterilizing!
[00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:41.774]  Bill Gates is the enemy!
[00:07:42.054 --> 00:07:43.415]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:07:47.556 --> 00:07:48.997]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:51.258]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:07:51.318 --> 00:07:52.618]  That is a baby snapping turtle.
[00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:54.159]  That is a baby Hillary.
[00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:54.959]  Named Sanuki.
[00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:00.535]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[00:08:00.655 --> 00:08:04.059]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[00:08:04.119 --> 00:08:06.722]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:07.763]  And that's my allegory.
[00:08:08.817 --> 00:08:19.765]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:22.147]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[00:08:22.207 --> 00:08:27.570]  But people take this, people are taking it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:34.035]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[00:08:34.175 --> 00:08:35.496]  It's a total solution.
[00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:36.757]  All around the best you're going to find.
[00:08:36.877 --> 00:08:37.738]  Turbo Force.
[00:08:37.878 --> 00:08:39.780]  Without you, we don't roll.
[00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.743]  With you, we surge forward together.
[00:08:41.863 --> 00:08:43.745]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:46.388]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[00:08:46.508 --> 00:08:49.512]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[00:08:49.532 --> 00:08:50.533]  It's a win-win.
[00:08:50.553 --> 00:08:51.714]  360 together.
