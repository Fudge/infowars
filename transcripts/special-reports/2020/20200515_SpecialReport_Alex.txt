[00:00:01.271 --> 00:00:21.099]  Despite the fact that the InfoWars budget is not what I wish it was, we hired a archivist who showed a skill and proclivity of being able to find clips from my broadcast that my crew is unable to find.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.822]  And now a treasure trove of videos are coming in from the last year.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:57.917]  Where I laid out specifically that phase one, they'll have a biological simulant that they hype up all the regular deaths as being caused by that simulant so that they can just gauge the hysteria factor and how much control they get from something that basically doesn't exist or the common cold that they've patented and own for profit and vaccine reasons, vaccine production reasons.
[00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:08.176]  And I specifically laid out then that the next event would probably be blamed on terrorists, but would be a real pathogen and that we'd look at hundreds of millions dead.
[00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:14.020]  Then there'll be a true police state lockdown, implantable chips, drones, robot control.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:33.900]   And then five years after everybody puts up with that or so, there'll be a few little breakouts here and there, uh, to demonize people that don't submit and to Make it a crime to not be surveilled and forcibly inoculated.
[00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:56.819]  Then after the public has beta tested and seen enough of that, they'll release the super bio weapon or they may just release a binary chemical weapon that either wipes everybody out at once or does it over the period of a couple years.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.801]  They'll call it a mystery illness.
[00:02:00.123 --> 00:02:11.066]  And Bill Gates then came out on Stephen Colbert last week and said, oh, this is the first pandemic and it's really just a drill.
[00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:13.907]  They love to fly in your face.
[00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:22.029]  But the second event, or event 201, it's going to be a bio weapon released by terrorists.
[00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.410]  So that's where they're going with this.
[00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:31.775]  And people ask, how do I just keep predicting everything they do precisely as they do it?
[00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.736]  Any good general studies their enemy and it gets in their head.
[00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:45.238]  And I'm completely obsessed with the globalists because they're the greatest threat to myself, my family, and your family.
[00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:55.961]  And the leg they have up on us is that what they're doing is so horrible.
[00:02:58.427 --> 00:03:02.490]  People just can't come to grips with it, because then they'd have to do something about it.
[00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:09.454]  But we have to get out of the stage of denial now, and really admit all this is going on.
[00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:44.527]   I was watching David Knight yesterday, the re-transmission on the network Fetal Info Wars, and the part I tuned into is that David played a clip from a group that's like Project Veritas in the UK, And the fellow was saying, he's talking to a whistleblower at a big pharma company about how they're adding a hormone to the vaccine for COVID-19.
[00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:56.876]  So that when your body has an autoimmune response to the adjuvant and to the COVID-19 virus, it also has a learned response to the hormone.
[00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:04.999]  And the fella said this is a whistleblower.
[00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:09.560]  So the video got hundreds of thousands of views and everybody debated whether it was real or not.
[00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:12.481]  And I'm glad David played that clip.
[00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:16.122]  I was going to play it as well yesterday, but never got around to it.
[00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:21.683]  And I was going to, though, do what I'm going to do today.
[00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:30.826]  Actually pull up hundreds of medical reports and studies and UN announcements about how they indeed do do that.
[00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:42.780]  And see, that's the weird thing about these globalists is they'll admit out of one side of their mouth they're doing something, but couch it in a way that makes it sound like it's reasonable.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:05:00.714]   And then when, say, Catholic bishops in Kenya get the tetanus shot tested, and they find out it's got the HCG in it, They then have Snopes come out and say it's inconclusive.
[00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:03.976]  Because, you know, Africans don't have good labs.
[00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:08.159]  They actually said that in Snopes and a bunch of other places.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.861]  So it's just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:17.825]  That everybody will run around like, oh look, this whistleblower claims this.
[00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:21.747]  And then it's all just right there.
[00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:29.336]   And so that's my frustration, is that Bill Gates is on record saying he wants to depopulate the earth.
[00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:38.278]  And he's on record being the designated tax-free foundation.
[00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:54.721]  So, Teddy Roosevelt thought he busted up the trust in 1906, but he really didn't do that with the Sherman Antitrust Act because they all put their money in quote, tax-free foundations.
[00:05:55.731 --> 00:06:00.013]  And so Bill Gates's shares and Bill Gates's money is tax-free.
[00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:19.283]  And then he does give about 5%, instead of paying 40% tax, he does give about 5% a year to carrying out the takeover of education, the rollout of surveillance, the rollout of implantable chips, the rollout of digital vaccines that also have an embedded nanotech.
[00:06:20.263 --> 00:06:21.744]  Just anything evil you can imagine.
[00:06:22.404 --> 00:06:23.465]  Weather modification.
[00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:26.788]  Tectonic Earth weapons.
[00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.872]  Anything evil you can imagine, you look into it and it's Bill Gates.
[00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:37.015]  But, I think it's Bill Gates' dad was on the board of the Federal Reserve.
[00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:40.037]  Bill Gates' dad ran Planned Parenthood.
[00:06:40.057 --> 00:06:46.121]  Bill Gates' dad was involved with the whole Cold Springs Harbor crew that was doing all the secret testing around the world.
[00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:50.343]  And then his mother was even more mobbed up on the IBM board.
[00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:53.866]  And they knew that, hey, people don't trust these big technology companies.
[00:06:54.758 --> 00:06:56.739]  Let's go with this WizKid deal.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.882]  And so they did that with Bill Gates.
[00:07:02.343 --> 00:07:06.006]  They went with the whole WizKid thing, with Steve Jobs, the whole WizKid thing.
[00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:07.427]  With the Google.
[00:07:08.348 --> 00:07:12.711]  Sergey Brin and Larry Page, they did it with... Oh, out of his garage!
[00:07:12.751 --> 00:07:14.132]  It's always out of a garage.
[00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:14.692]  Dell.
[00:07:15.453 --> 00:07:16.793]  It's always out of a garage.
[00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:19.635]  Everything's out of a garage.
[00:07:19.675 --> 00:07:21.537]  YouTube, start out of a garage.
[00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:24.623]  Oh, it just started out of a garage.
[00:07:24.663 --> 00:07:25.744]  They're such nice kids.
[00:07:26.344 --> 00:07:26.464]  Oh!
[00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:30.126]  He started it out of his dorm at Harvard.
[00:07:30.747 --> 00:07:31.347]  Facebook!
[00:07:31.867 --> 00:07:35.369]  The day Facebook went live, the CIA turned off their Facebook.
[00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.770]  Look it up, folks.
[00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.352]  Oh, and who's the mentor to Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:07:42.373 --> 00:07:45.955]  Aw, Bill Gates and they both wear pink sweaters now.
[00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:48.657]  Aw, they're so trustworthy.
[00:07:49.657 --> 00:07:50.858]  They're so helpful.
[00:07:51.857 --> 00:07:53.078]  They're so good.
[00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:57.701]  And people ask me, they go, man, are you crazy going up against these dudes?
[00:07:59.182 --> 00:08:04.626]  Hey, look, I get there's too many people in some areas and I get the third world populations aren't getting enough to eat.
[00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:07.388]  So they are malnourished and they have small brains.
[00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:11.271]  I don't care if you're a poor white person, poor black person, you get malnourished.
[00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:12.512]  You're, you're a zombie.
[00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:20.218]   Um, but when you study Gates and all these people, They're trying to dumb down everybody.
[00:08:20.278 --> 00:08:21.878]  They're GMOing everybody.
[00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:24.159]  Just like when he opened up those mosquitoes.
[00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:25.880]  That was an archetypal example.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.780]  A tell.
[00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:31.102]  He says, oh, no reason only the third world should experience this.
[00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:33.183]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:08:33.203 --> 00:08:42.346]  And their argument is, if you're not smart enough to avoid GMO, which is almost impossible, and to avoid 5G, which is almost impossible, well then you deserve to die.
[00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:46.748]  And so I've done my best.
[00:08:49.082 --> 00:08:52.284]  Uh, everybody in my family is completely freaked out now.
[00:08:52.304 --> 00:08:56.326]  I mean, they don't look at me like, oh, he's right about a lot of stuff, but he's a little eccentric.
[00:08:56.866 --> 00:09:00.188]  Now they look at me like I'm the Grim Reaper and Darth Vader rolled into one.
[00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:04.011]  Uh, no folks, I'm warning you about Darth Vader.
[00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:06.712]  Darth Vader is a cream puff compared to these people.
[00:09:07.993 --> 00:09:13.316]  And so folks ask how I take all the stress and how I take being attacked and lied about.
[00:09:15.037 --> 00:09:21.539]   Well, when you realize you're right about this stuff, It's not heroic to fight it, as I've said a thousand times.
[00:09:24.101 --> 00:09:29.344]  If somebody tied bowling balls around my legs and threw me into the deep end of the pool, I'm going to try to get those bowling balls off my legs and get out.
[00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:31.586]  That's not heroic.
[00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:38.730]  So the longer you're in denial, the more time you're underwater without oxygen.
[00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.471]  That's the analogy.
[00:09:41.312 --> 00:09:43.593]  And look, I'm right about it all.
[00:09:43.693 --> 00:09:43.973]  Okay.
[00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:46.355]  Because I'm not right about any of it.
[00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:48.236]  I'm telling you what's there.
[00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:51.181]  This isn't about I predicted this stuff.
[00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:53.042]  It was all ready there.
[00:09:53.222 --> 00:09:55.082]  It didn't come true.
[00:09:55.802 --> 00:09:57.043]  It was already going on.
[00:09:58.543 --> 00:10:09.265]  If I tell you that there's a dead body buried in the basement, and you go down there and dig it up and there's a dead body, it doesn't suddenly appear when you find it.
[00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:11.786]  The dead body's already there.
[00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:14.266]  And that's an analogy for the media.
[00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:16.186]  Don't have any dead bodies in the basement.
[00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:17.727]  Not gonna eat the neighbors.
[00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:18.927]  Jonathan Swift.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:27.422]  You know, it's like Rush Limbaugh said the other day, they were comparing Trump to Hoover and the Depression.
[00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:33.321]   One possible one good part about everybody being so dumbed down is I don't know who Herbert Hoover was
[00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:43.680]   And that's what's really sad about this whole thing is people don't know Jonathan Swift is
[00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:48.708]  I'm going to tell you this, you're going to find out who Bill Gates is.
[00:10:51.110 --> 00:11:00.110]   Because all the big money was already obsessed with something called "social Darwinism."
[00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:15.110]  [MUSIC]
[00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.844]   InfoWars Tomorrow's News.
[00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:18.505]  Today.
[00:11:20.802 --> 00:11:33.514]  Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, X2, X3, and over here, Vitamin Mineral Fusion with all the amino acids, the vitamins, the minerals, Turbo Force, 10-Hour Clean Energy.
[00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:37.898]  You just go on down the line, Vaso Beats and all the rest of it.
[00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:45.625]  These are things God gave us through the natural environment that we're not supposed to be aware of.
[00:11:47.688 --> 00:11:49.029]  What do you think the drug companies do?
[00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:55.752]  They give you synthetic versions of this for 10, 20, 30 times what that actually costs.
[00:11:57.252 --> 00:12:02.575]  But we promote what God gave us, and we go out and we find the very best products available.
[00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:03.335]  Look at this.
[00:12:03.895 --> 00:12:04.936]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:09.218]  You know, I remember getting pitched this by a developer.
[00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:15.942]  Six, seven years ago, about PQQ and Cocu10, we had to buy the first product we got from Mitsubishi.
[00:12:16.262 --> 00:12:17.563]  The Japanese are obsessed with this.
[00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:21.866]  And I remember going, okay, this stuff's really great.
[00:12:22.386 --> 00:12:30.752]  And I started taking it, and like a month in, my back that had been hurt, like, was hurting again, because the nerves were growing back.
[00:12:30.832 --> 00:12:35.535]  And I was having these wild dreams, and like, I was like, what the hell is this?
[00:12:36.758 --> 00:12:40.159]  Well it turns out God gave us a lot of things.
[00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:40.519]  Look at this.
[00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:42.540]  Do an overhead shot if you can.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.220]  Look at this.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.262]  Look what's in a bottle of DNA Force Plus.
[00:12:47.302 --> 00:12:51.343]  Look at that.
[00:12:51.363 --> 00:12:58.965]  Because in this universe we've been given a lot of things.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:07.963]  We take them for granted, but man, I tell you, what's in that is something incredibly special.
[00:13:10.044 --> 00:13:11.305]  But that's the way it works, isn't it?
[00:13:12.405 --> 00:13:14.326]  All I deliver is what is the best.
[00:13:15.447 --> 00:13:19.589]  And that's DNA Force Plus at Infolarestore.com.
