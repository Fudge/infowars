[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.440]  [Outro]
[00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:18.400]  I was at my parents.
[00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.722]  They were having a little bonfire in their backyard.
[00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:22.363]  Some of the crew was there.
[00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:24.885]  We were, again, eating chili and roasting hot dogs.
[00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:28.827]  And about 9.30 at night, my phone starts getting texts.
[00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:29.928]  Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz.
[00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:32.090]  Start getting calls saying, I'm so sorry.
[00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.131]  Sorry to hear about what's happening to you.
[00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.052]  This is terrible.
[00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:37.474]  And then I start reading.
[00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.492]  The links they'd sent me.
[00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:42.533]  CNN, New York Times, ABC News.
[00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:45.335]  And it says Alex Jones in trouble.
[00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:47.236]  Alex Jones loses lawsuit.
[00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.637]  Alex Jones proven to be an evil person.
[00:00:49.717 --> 00:01:00.383]  And I go inside into my parents' little library on their second floor to go to the bathroom and there's a TV on that has local news and it's Alex Jones loses court battle with Sandy Hook family.
[00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:06.164]   So it was a top story from a court ruling 11 days before that had been in
[00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:07.043]  the local news.
[00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:10.683]   But they sat on it, they waited, and clearly the breakaway shadow government, stay behind
[00:01:10.683 --> 00:01:16.323]   network CIA, that plants stories, had ordered this put out when people start watching the
[00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:19.442]  news and tune back in to watch the ball drop.
[00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:23.364]   And right as the ball was dropping on some channels, they were running in the scroll
[00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:27.043]   that Alex Jones is a failure, Alex Jones has lost the lawsuit.
[00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:32.802]   They don't do things like this unless what you're doing is absolutely devastating their
[00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:34.444]  criminal activities.
[00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:36.685]  This is incredible.
[00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:38.806]  I mean, we are over the target.
[00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:40.046]  That's why we're getting this much flack.
[00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:40.886]  It's amazing.
[00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:50.708]  Remember six months ago, the Wall Street Journal-owned Market Watch, as well as AP, ran false headlines that I lost a Sandy Hook lawsuit for writing a book, Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[00:01:50.768 --> 00:01:51.708]  I never wrote that book.
[00:01:51.808 --> 00:01:52.809]  I've never read that book.
[00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:53.769]  My lawyers have seen it.
[00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:54.769]  I'm not in that book.
[00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.029]  I was not in that lawsuit.
[00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.829]  It's a total hoax.
[00:01:57.028 --> 00:02:02.028]   At least this story is partially true that the last year and a half, this local judge,
[00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:10.609]   all total, has fined us or whatever for saying we didn't do things properly over $100,000.
[00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.367]   And it's all over the news that that's just completely outrageous in most people's views.
[00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.228]  But at least this story had some truth in it.
[00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:19.429]  But that's not what matters.
[00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:25.588]   What matters is that the power structure, we're so inside their head that they had this
[00:02:25.588 --> 00:02:30.147]   whole elaborate thing just to make it look like I'm a loser and I'm a failure and I'm
[00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:34.747]   in trouble when it's their whole New World Order falling apart and the EU falling apart
[00:02:34.747 --> 00:02:38.868]   and the Communist Labor Party being thrown out of power and a global political realignment
[00:02:38.868 --> 00:02:44.388]   against the New World Order system that InfoWars is on record helping launch, that you're on
[00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:46.868]  record as our supporters helping launch.
[00:02:46.868 --> 00:02:47.868]  So...
[00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:49.367]  This was an incredible gift.
[00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:54.289]  I mean, I feel so honored that this was like wartime-level propaganda.
[00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:00.930]  Before, in the old days, we were planting WMDs on somebody or something, and they would hype it all up on the news.
[00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.191]  Like, it's like I'm Saddam or somebody.
[00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:17.154]  And that just means that we are kicking their globalist ass, and they see us as a symbol of Americana, and of renaissance, and of freedom, which we are, and that we've got their number, and that we're really kicking their asses.
[00:03:17.694 --> 00:03:19.635]  With the information and the truth we put out.
[00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:21.975]  So just keep spreading the word at Bandot Video.
[00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:23.856]  Keep sharing the articles and videos.
[00:03:23.896 --> 00:03:25.236]  They cannot stand it.
[00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:27.817]  We're their number one enemy because of you taking action.
[00:03:28.057 --> 00:03:29.217]  So I just salute you in 2020.
[00:03:29.257 --> 00:03:30.598]  This is amazing.
[00:03:30.618 --> 00:03:32.938]  And thanks for all the financial support to keep us on air.
[00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:34.319]  We got big plans next year.
[00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.839]  All sorts of stuff expanding in their face.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.220]  You have stepped up to the plate and said no to the tyrants.
[00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.461]  And they have bitten off more than they can chew with the American people.
[00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:48.563]   And these bullies know now that America is awake and the dominoes are falling in our
[00:03:48.563 --> 00:03:52.762]   direction against them and there's nothing they can do so God bless you all.
[00:03:52.762 --> 00:04:02.539]   Just here in the bright I went and got a delicious cup My second cup of the day.
[00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.300]  It's really strong, I shouldn't do this.
[00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:07.504]  Because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[00:04:07.544 --> 00:04:08.825]  And the coffee adds to it, but mmm.
[00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:10.547]  Wake Up America coffee, everybody loves.
[00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.368]  Highest rated, from the choppest mountains.
[00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:14.671]  It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:15.672]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[00:04:15.732 --> 00:04:18.154]  It's right on the border between the two countries, in those rainforests.
[00:04:18.294 --> 00:04:19.174]  Hand-selected.
[00:04:19.214 --> 00:04:20.075]  It's beyond organic.
[00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:20.855]  Wild-crafted.
[00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:22.436]  Wake Up America coffee.
[00:04:22.516 --> 00:04:23.776]  People are blown away by how good it is.
[00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:28.218]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container.
[00:04:28.298 --> 00:04:28.818]  Yes, folks.
[00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:30.058]  We've been selling it 10 years.
[00:04:30.078 --> 00:04:30.879]  Never raised the price.
[00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:32.979]  $19.95 for that big old bag.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.880]  99% reviews.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.640]  598 reviews.

[00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:53.714]  Patriot Blend Medium Roast only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:55.076]  It's not as popular.
[00:04:56.198 --> 00:04:58.261]  Anyways, it's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
