[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.329]  Look up there in the sky!
[00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.070]  Say, Chinese virus!
[00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:05.051]  Look at the plane!
[00:00:05.531 --> 00:00:06.972]  Chinese virus!
[00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:08.872]  Look at the plane!
[00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:15.075]  Say, Chinese virus!
[00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:21.337]  San Antonio, home of the Alamo, an American and Texas free speech.
[00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:26.325]  Now hangs under a shadow of tyrants and communists.
[00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:31.306]  Claiming there is no free speech in San Antonio.
[00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.866]  There is free speech in San Antonio.
[00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:43.608]  Your mayor and other maybe tyrants would have you believe that you have no free speech.
[00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:49.029]  But you do have free speech to say things that are true and that are not true.
[00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:55.521]  That's what the First Amendment's all about!
[00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:55.721]  See?
[00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:57.184]  ChineseVirus.com.
[00:00:57.826 --> 00:00:59.529]  It came from Communist China.
[00:01:00.952 --> 00:01:01.954]  And your city council...
[00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:13.697]  He believes that you do not have any free speech like Hitler did, like Stalin did, like Mao did, but you do have free speech, San Antonio.
[00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:23.120]  And we're here in front of your tyrannical, wicked city hall that should report anyone that says Chinese virus.
[00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:34.157]  My name is Alexander Edward Jones of America in Texas, and I am here to report to you the virus came from Communist China!
[00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:38.114]  So go ahead and try to lock me up, you tyrants!
[00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:41.996]  Run by the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center!
[00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:47.298]  Where they have said it's illegal to say Chinese lawyers and they'll arrest us!
[00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:48.999]  I say you're dangerous thugs!
[00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:51.140]  I say you're dangerous tyrants!
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.881]  I say you're un-American!
[00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:56.643]  And the City Council should move to North Korea!
[00:01:57.843 --> 00:01:59.804]  COMMUNIST CHINESE VIRUS!
[00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:10.851]  All right, let's roll it under the yellow boat.
[00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:21.597]  And now we're here in San Antonio, the birthplace of Texas freedom, and the city council is working with the Democratic Party and the CHICOMS, saying it's not a Chinese virus.
[00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:22.698]  Well, they're right.
[00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:25.440]  It's a communist Chinese virus.
[00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.077]  But even if speech is wrong, you have a right to say it.
[00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:29.898]  But it's true.
[00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:33.718]  It is a communist Chinese virus.
[00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:39.718]  [music]
[00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:40.718]  Thanks for coming out here, sir.
[00:02:40.718 --> 00:02:41.718]  Thank you, sir.
[00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:44.723]   You guys already out of there? Just guess we're gonna be out here.
[00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:45.723]  How you doing sir?
[00:02:45.723 --> 00:02:46.723]  Nice to meet you sir.
[00:02:46.723 --> 00:02:47.723]  What's your name?
[00:02:47.723 --> 00:02:48.723]  Andrew.
[00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:49.723]  Nice to meet you Andrew.
[00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:50.722]  How you doing sir?
[00:02:50.722 --> 00:02:51.722]  Good to see you.
[00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:52.722]  Tell us why you're out here.
[00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:54.203]  I heard you come so I cut off work early and came out.
[00:02:54.203 --> 00:02:55.722]  God bless you brother.
[00:02:55.722 --> 00:03:02.162]   And now that they're trying to censor my thinking, my thoughts, Kung-Fu fighting.
[00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:04.834]  You know, Chinese virus?
[00:03:04.914 --> 00:03:05.976]  I can't say that now?
[00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:07.739]  Ron Nuremberg controls this?
[00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.081]  Like, who does he think he is?
[00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:14.491]  I think that they're trying to control our food in order to try to control us as a population and all this is fearful.
[00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:21.990]  So, Mayor Ron Berg, he did a lot of activism with Texas Organizing Project.
[00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.934]  Texas Organizing Project does block walking for him, call banking for him, and they work directly with Bernard Sampson of the Texas Communist Party, headquartered out of Houston.
[00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:33.314]  Ron Norenberg is a tyrant!
[00:03:34.174 --> 00:03:35.015]  Chinese virus!
[00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:36.515]  CHINESE VIRUS!
[00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:41.997]  It's a communist Chinese virus meant to take down America!
[00:03:43.496 --> 00:03:50.301]  And the city council is so evil in this town that they believe that you don't have a First Amendment, they want to arrest you for your speech.
[00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:53.784]  That is so dangerous, America.
[00:03:54.664 --> 00:03:56.145]  It's so dangerous.
[00:03:56.985 --> 00:04:03.655]   We need to liberate San Antonio from the tyrants that have seized control of it, that are annihilating the First
[00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:04.485]  Amendment.
[00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:11.485]   The clear and present danger here in San Antonio, one of the oldest, greatest cities in Texas,
[00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:19.646]   is to throw these criminal city council members out that don't think they live in America, they think they live in
[00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:20.485]  communist China.
[00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:29.485]   But I salute everyone that's out here, and the answer to their tyranny is 1776 and 1836!
[00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:36.191]  America and the world is waking up to the COVID-19 Chinese virus hoax!
[00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:52.992]  Save Chinese Virus dot com! (x8)
[00:04:52.992 --> 00:05:00.992]  Save Chinese Virus dot com! (x8)
[00:05:00.992 --> 00:05:10.992]  Save Chinese Virus dot com! (x8)
[00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:13.717]  And then about six years ago, they said, Hey, you can private label it.
[00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:18.399]  And then you can even get a bigger discount with us and sell the food at the lowest price anywhere.
[00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.060]  Now, since then, they've become the biggest storable food company in the world.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.001]  Definitely the biggest in the United States.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.161]  They're in our back end, at inputworkstore.com.
[00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:28.360]   We have their full catalog, the lowest prices you're gonna find.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.600]  They're my patriot with their ready hour food.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.319]   Now I just busted open one of the crate containers today with some of the food we have here at the office,
[00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.000]   just spur of the moment to show you this because they don't just have a lot of staples in there,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.800]   they have a lot of really tasty things in there, like chocolate pudding, Southwestern rice,
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.000]   orange energy drink mix, buttermilk pancakes, mac and cheese, and even Vice and others have gone
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.560]   and gotten the mac and cheese and other stuff and said, "Man, this is really, really good."
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.720]   Yeah, folks, and it's on average about five times cheaper than you're gonna find for products in grocery stores.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.159]   And the point is it comes in these big sealed tote containers.
[00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.360]   It lasts 25 years, and then it's in vacuum sealed containers inside that.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.841]   And then let me show listeners, I actually forgot to do this.
[00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:17.841]   It's got these oxygen packs in there as well, so water doesn't get into it and cause any problems.
[00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:25.627]  With them trying to start race riots and the craziness of the election and the wars and the quickening around the planet, everybody needs to get storable food now.
[00:06:26.368 --> 00:06:29.991]  So that you have that check box covered to be ready and be prepared.
[00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.172]  Have a rural place to go.
[00:06:31.192 --> 00:06:32.493]  Have family you can work with.
[00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:33.714]  Have a place with a working well.
[00:06:33.834 --> 00:06:34.535]  Have firearms.
[00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:35.236]  Know how to use them.
[00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:36.557]  Have a relationship with God.
[00:06:36.637 --> 00:06:37.798]  Have your gut and spirit ready.
[00:06:37.858 --> 00:06:38.719]  That's most important.
[00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:39.880]  Having basic skills.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.800]  Know how to skin a buck.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.501]  Run a trot line.
[00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:42.362]  These are all important.
[00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:44.043]  But having the food covered.
[00:06:44.123 --> 00:06:45.845]  That is all critical.
[00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:51.309]  And again, I just busted open one of these packs and it's got a 72 hour kit in it.
[00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:52.671]  Emergency food shortage.
[00:06:53.826 --> 00:07:00.648]  And this package is filled with a whole bunch of little packs for you to be able to take care of yourself and your family.
[00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:01.088]  Look at these.
[00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:06.049]  Creamy Chicken Rice, Black Bean Soup, Homestyle Potato Soup, Mac and Cheese.
[00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:08.590]  You can just throw one of these in the back of your Jeep or your truck.
[00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.291]  You and two or three other people can go out for the weekend and feed yourselves and take care of yourselves.
[00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:17.372]   Or you can take care of yourself For a lot longer, I think, than 72 hours.
[00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:20.453]  And again, this has good ingredients in it, high quality.
[00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:22.074]  Tastes great, and that's important.
[00:07:22.394 --> 00:07:24.554]  And you want all the little tasty things as well.
[00:07:24.574 --> 00:07:28.615]  I just randomly opened one of these tubs up and had all the little kind of tasty goodies in it.
[00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:30.736]  A lot of the other staples are in the other ones.
[00:07:30.776 --> 00:07:35.557]  But while you still can, because we're going into the quickening right now, have this checkbox covered.
[00:07:35.697 --> 00:07:36.657]  Know you've got it in your attic.
[00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:37.677]  Know you've got it in your basement.
[00:07:37.697 --> 00:07:38.998]  Know you've got it out of your farmhouse.
[00:07:39.118 --> 00:07:39.958]  Know you've buried it.
[00:07:40.018 --> 00:07:42.958]  Whatever you do, inhabit so that you're prepared and you're ready.
[00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:44.099]  And it funds the Info War.
[00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:44.519]  A total 360 win.
[00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:46.420]  This is insurance you can eat.
[00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:49.364]  The only way you lose is by not taking action.
[00:07:49.644 --> 00:07:50.605]  So get prepared.
[00:07:50.826 --> 00:07:52.247]  The grasshopper doesn't prepare.
[00:07:52.528 --> 00:07:53.409]  It dies in the winter.
[00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:54.230]  The ant prepares.
