[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.897]  The most recent issue, getting back COVID-19 test results that aren't even yours.
[00:00:05.778 --> 00:00:13.129]  I get a phone call asking for me, and I said, yes, this is Mindy Clark, and they say, well, we want you to know that your test was positive.
[00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:17.364]  And I said, I looked at their phone like, positive for what?
[00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:19.425]  And they said positive for COVID.
[00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:22.306]  And I said, there's no way possible.
[00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:25.567]  And she said, oh yeah, she said you did the test.
[00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:26.868]  And I said, no ma'am.
[00:00:27.308 --> 00:00:31.070]  Mindy Clark had gone to the drive-thru testing site at Manatee Rural Health.
[00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.473]  But before she was able to get swabbed, she left the line because she realized it was for people with symptoms only.
[00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:41.554]  And I said, you need to take that off my record.
[00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:43.135]  She goes, well, we don't know now.
[00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.336]  You have to prove to us that you're negative.
[00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:52.139]  She tested negative just two days later and also tested negative for the antibodies.
[00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:56.381]  And according to many of our viewers, this hasn't only happened to her.
[00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:06.425]  Clark says if she and many others have been incorrectly identified as positive in the state system so easily, how accurate are the numbers that are released daily?
[00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:07.866]  Both of it actually happening.
[00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:18.099]  That if the general population grasps this and takes action with this information, we're going to save the country and stop this globalist coup that we are now in the middle of.
[00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:27.641]  Now, I decided to take off part of the week and come with my children to the Panhandle of Florida, one of the freest places in the United States.
[00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:29.742]  It's not like the rest of Florida.
[00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:36.024]  It's just full of great people and folks from the South coming here of all race, colors, and creeds to enjoy fun in the sun.
[00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:42.048]  And I have talked since I've been here three days to hundreds of people, hundreds and hundreds of people.
[00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:45.009]  In fact, I'd say every other person I run into is a listener.
[00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:46.469]  It's been, it's been great.
[00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.851]  Almost nobody's wearing the stupid mask and people understand it's a fraud.
[00:01:51.051 --> 00:02:03.876]  But when I talk to folks, they tell me, Oh, listen, my mom, my brother, my sister, my daughter got an email or a call that she had COVID-19 because somebody else they knew at their office or their work at it.
[00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:06.117]  And they were just told you do have COVID-19.
[00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:09.449]  And you've been putting the records as that.
[00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:20.937]  And I would explain to them, well it's on record, it's on record that that's what the CDC and NIH do and that it's totally fraudulent.
[00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:27.341]  Well yesterday my wife wanted to go to this swimsuit shop like 20 miles away.
[00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:51.703]   So I'm sitting there for 30 minutes while she's trying on these swimsuits and I hear the 20-year-old woman, I later found out her age, I talked to her at length, talking about how her brother, you'll hear the audio in a moment, had gotten the notice that he had COVID-19 when he went into a clinic to get checked because all the hysteria.
[00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:55.944]  They got his information but never tested him and then called and told him you have COVID-19.
[00:02:57.184 --> 00:03:08.947]   And I'm listening to this woman tell the story to a group of teenage girls with some college women And one of the older college girls was talking about her family.
[00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:12.329]  I didn't get this on tape because I recorded this right after.
[00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:32.564]   And she was talking about how her family, a lot of her family members, I forget who now, was actually involved at the top of the state level with the governor and how the governor is about to announce That everyone actually has to have a social security number attached to it and attached to the test and proof of the test.
[00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:38.027]  And they're talking about prosecuting these labs, 333 that have 100% positives, totally impossible.
[00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:42.829]  And say, and that she knows it's a fraud and all these other women knew it was a fraud.
[00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.290]  And I talked to him about 10 minutes.
[00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:48.972]  My phone was dead or I would have been interviewing him.
[00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:52.034]  My wife comes out of the changing area with the swimsuit she wanted.
[00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:59.316]   And I recorded on her phone what you're about to hear, but Because I just had the lady behind the counter repeat the story she told me.
[00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:05.943]  But I'm literally being mobbed by people telling me this everywhere I go.
[00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:09.366]  But I keep asking folks, have you called Congress?
[00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:11.367]  Have you called the Governor's office?
[00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:14.008]  Have you gotten up in front of your church and given a speech?
[00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:16.629]  You've got to tell everybody you know.
[00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.009]  You've got to tell everybody on the elevator.
[00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.090]  You've got to tell them at the bar.
[00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.450]  You've got to tell them on the beach.
[00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.611]  You've got to tell them when you go home.
[00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:22.971]  You've got to tell the PTA.
[00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:24.292]  You've got to go speak in front of the school.
[00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:27.293]  You've got to get local doctors that you know to come out and speak about it.
[00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:44.092]  Because they're trying to suppress all these doctors, all these scientists, all these virologists, all these nurses that have come out and exposed them murdering old people by the tens of thousands, lying on all the tests, and it's all organized by Fauci and Bill and Melinda Gates and John Hopkins.
[00:04:44.732 --> 00:04:51.634]  That's why you always hear, John Hopkins says, John Hopkins says, John Hopkins ran event 201 and lockstep with the Rockefellers.
[00:04:51.694 --> 00:04:52.054]  Look it up.
[00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:53.935]  They're on the top of the documents.
[00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:56.786]  They set this whole thing up.
[00:04:56.866 --> 00:05:00.029]  It's a giant premeditated criminal conspiracy.
[00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.349]  It's capital murder.
[00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.191]  And that's why it's open and shut.
[00:05:04.652 --> 00:05:16.881]  Is they hid the whole thing in plain view, set it up, launched it, implemented it, ran the Wuhan lab, have the deadly vaccines coming out, that aren't even vaccines, they reprogram your DNA.
[00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:20.123]  I mean, this is a frickin' science fiction nightmare movie.
[00:05:20.383 --> 00:05:21.784]  I keep pinching myself.
[00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:27.997]   And so I told the woman, I said, listen, you've got to tell everybody you know.
[00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:29.479]  She said, no, I know we do.
[00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:30.800]  So I gave her a high five.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.381]  My wife did.
[00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:34.183]  But that's what we got to do here.
[00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:38.049]  Because people understand this all over the place.
[00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.830]  And we send crews to California.
[00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.774]  Caitlin Bennett and most of the people she talked to on the beach in California knew it was all BS.
[00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:48.156]  Same thing with folks we talked to in New York.
[00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:50.397]  America gets what's going on.
[00:05:50.577 --> 00:05:52.058]  Europe gets what's going on.
[00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:57.082]  They've had top ministers in England say that they inflated the numbers and it was all a fraud and fake test.
[00:05:57.702 --> 00:05:59.023]  Australia has the same thing going on.
[00:05:59.523 --> 00:06:00.844]  It's a global plan.
[00:06:01.424 --> 00:06:04.006]  But notice that some of them backing off as they get caught in a fraud.
[00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:05.047]  They're doubling down.
[00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:12.912]  The UN came out in December of last year and said vaccines are killing people, there's been a cover-up, the doctors know it, our front lines wobbly.
[00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:19.496]  So they launched this operation to double down and totally take over and then get us used to martial law.
[00:06:20.036 --> 00:06:22.698]  This thing is the jewel in the crown of the takedown of the West.
[00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.299]  Notice China and everybody else are already open for business.
[00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:27.400]  We must stop complying.
[00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:30.562]  We're not complying to save people because it's the right thing to do.
[00:06:31.003 --> 00:06:34.945]  You read all the CNN headlines, it's like record deaths, record numbers, all of it's lies.
[00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:40.327]  They're like hundreds dying a day because they put people from regular deaths in the column.
[00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:41.728]  Hundreds a day is the headline.
[00:06:41.808 --> 00:06:50.112]  Hundreds a day die as Trump comes out and tries to make everybody be positive when he's the one that destroyed the country by not fighting the virus.
[00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.393]  No, the hysteria over the virus.
[00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:59.219]  The stampeding hysteria of Lemmings is what's gotten us in this and acting like Lemmings is only going to make it worse.
[00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:01.601]  We must expose Fauci and Gates.
[00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:03.523]  Fauci needs to go to prison.
[00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.484]  Bill Gates needs to go to prison.
[00:07:05.845 --> 00:07:13.371]  We need to take these monsters on, head on, and expose Big Pharma for what it's done and how dare Big Tech be censoring everybody during this.
[00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.012]  They're weak is why they have to do it.
[00:07:16.772 --> 00:07:17.473]  They're criminals.
[00:07:17.573 --> 00:07:22.096]  And the good news is, InfoWars.com, ban.video, and the videos are getting out everywhere.
[00:07:22.456 --> 00:07:23.637]  Your information is getting out.
[00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.438]  You should shoot a Facebook.
[00:07:25.518 --> 00:07:26.459]  You should shoot a YouTube.
[00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:28.100]  You should shoot a Twitter.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:35.925]  All of you, whether you're a nurse or whether you got tested and weren't positive and they told you you were or vice versa, everybody needs to speak out.
[00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:39.147]  Everybody needs to be heard on the ground and in cyberspace.
[00:07:39.947 --> 00:07:43.688]  Everybody needs to promote InfoWars as a symbol of freedom.
[00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:48.090]  Put it in the enemy's face to let them know that we understand that we're all InfoWars now.
[00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.951]  That's starting to happen and it's beautiful.
[00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:55.133]  There's all these scientists, all these doctors, all these nurses exposing all this at Bandot Video.
[00:07:55.453 --> 00:07:59.034]  And as their videos get pulled off the web, they have a place to still live at Bandot Video.
[00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:01.075]  And that's why your support of InfoWars is so beautiful.
[00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:02.096]  It's so wonderful.
[00:08:02.536 --> 00:08:07.378]  And what you've done helping us and helping yourself has been just a lifesaver.
[00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:08.518]  So again, I want to thank you.
[00:08:08.598 --> 00:08:11.620]  So you never finished your story.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.840]  What just happened to your brother?
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.941]  Where was he?
[00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:15.162]  Oh, in Nashville.
[00:08:15.202 --> 00:08:18.684]  He went in to get tested at the hospital, their local hospital.
[00:08:18.704 --> 00:08:21.565]  And he lives right outside of Nashville.
[00:08:21.485 --> 00:08:22.485]  What did you say happened to your brother?
[00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:23.485]  Where was he?
[00:08:23.485 --> 00:08:24.485]  Oh yeah, I heard you saying like...
[00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:25.485]  Oh in Nashville.
[00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:31.884]   They, um, they, he went in to get tested at the hospital, their like local hospital.
[00:08:31.884 --> 00:08:34.884]  And um, he lives right outside of Nashville.
[00:08:34.884 --> 00:08:37.524]  And he didn't even get tested or anything.
[00:08:37.524 --> 00:08:42.524]   And he walked in, they took his name and his phone number and said, "It's gonna be a two
[00:08:42.524 --> 00:08:43.524]  hour wait."
[00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:44.524]  And he said, "I'm not waiting two hours."
[00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.284]  So he walked out.
[00:08:46.297 --> 00:08:53.747]   They called him back Next day whatever and said hey you tested positive for Corona Yeah.
[00:08:53.787 --> 00:08:54.408]  Now, COVID.
[00:08:55.108 --> 00:08:56.909]  He said, but I haven't even gotten tested.
[00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:59.811]  Like, I didn't even go in and get tested.
[00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:00.972]  So, anyways.
[00:09:01.012 --> 00:09:01.893]  Did they respond?
[00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:02.693]  I don't know.
[00:09:02.754 --> 00:09:03.394]  I didn't hear.
[00:09:03.414 --> 00:09:04.615]  He just came in town yesterday.
[00:09:04.635 --> 00:09:08.498]  Well, that's happened to everybody because the hospital... It's happening in Texas.
[00:09:08.578 --> 00:09:09.238]  It's all over the country.
[00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:13.401]  But the other lady was just here at the counter saying her, like, family works running it.
[00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:13.841]  Yeah, her dad.
[00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:14.682]  They're aware of it, yeah.
[00:09:14.702 --> 00:09:16.924]  So, it's like everybody I talk to, this is happening to.
[00:09:16.944 --> 00:09:17.264]  It's crazy.
[00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:17.384]  Yeah.
[00:09:17.744 --> 00:09:18.044]  It is.
[00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:19.445]  It is really crazy.
[00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:22.407]  Well, hopefully we wake people up, you know.
[00:09:22.868 --> 00:09:23.108]  Yeah.
[00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:26.801]  It's like that video you were showing me, like the TV kills over a million people.
[00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:29.563]  Nobody's wearing a mask for that, but they're doing this just for the election, I think.
[00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:34.206]  Yeah, once that election's over, I'm sure something will change.
[00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:34.566]  Hoping.
[00:09:34.586 --> 00:09:34.807]  Hoping.
[00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:36.268]  It'll change for the better.
[00:09:36.288 --> 00:09:38.469]  Well, if it's just the new normal, it's a whole bunch of problems, yeah.
[00:09:38.569 --> 00:09:41.531]  Well, anyways, I think they're planning something else.
[00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:42.352]  What do you think they'll pull next?
[00:09:42.952 --> 00:09:43.613]  I don't know.
[00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:45.214]  It's been the craziest time ever.
[00:09:45.234 --> 00:09:48.236]  It was good talking to you.
[00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:49.177]  I'm gonna look that video up.
[00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:56.574]  What we're actually seeing is the systematic implementation of the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Corporation of the United States.
[00:09:57.454 --> 00:10:01.096]  Every major event is a step in the ladder to achieve that end.
[00:10:02.277 --> 00:10:07.559]  COVID is just another rung in the ladder, which is why there's a deliberate mixing of all the wordplay.
[00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:08.219]  Right?
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.761]  I mean, we should stop calling it, you know, quarantine.
[00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:13.382]  That's a term designated for people that are verified sick.
[00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:17.184]  This is a house arrest mandated by the state.
[00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:22.465]  You should stop calling it, you know, social distancing, because there's nothing social about forced isolation.
[00:10:23.946 --> 00:10:29.067]  We should stop saying safer at home when millions of Americans don't have basic necessities adequate to fit their needs.
[00:10:29.127 --> 00:10:33.428]  It assumes that everybody's home is equally as safe as the people that are making the statements.
[00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:38.330]  We should stop saying, you know, this is for the greater good, right?
[00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:45.312]  When you close the economy, killing millions of businesses that families have worked generations to establish, that's anything but good.
[00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:49.053]  We should stop saying, this is the new normal.
[00:10:49.254 --> 00:10:51.295]  That's just blank mind control drivel.
[00:10:51.695 --> 00:10:54.016]  There's nothing normal about forced isolation.
[00:10:54.056 --> 00:11:01.139]  You know, treating your neighbor like they have the plague, breathing your own bodily waste, wearing masks, living in constant fear of contamination.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.120]  That's normal?
[00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:14.146]  I mean, after all, if the virus is so deadly, why hasn't it wiped out the homeless who don't social distance, wash themselves regularly, let alone, you know, live in or have access to a sterile environment?
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.462]  Last year, 1.5 million people died of tuberculosis.
[00:11:20.022 --> 00:11:23.184]  Why were you not wearing a mask during the tuberculosis pandemic?
[00:11:24.064 --> 00:11:29.087]  You were endangering public health and safety, along with billions of other people around the globe.
[00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:31.408]  So why didn't you wear a mask?
[00:11:32.568 --> 00:11:33.229]  I'll tell you why.
[00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:36.170]  Because the mainstream media didn't tell you to wear a mask.
[00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:43.658]  mask. Because 1.5 million people died from tuberculosis.
[00:11:43.658 --> 00:11:50.789]   There was no tuberculosis pandemic any more than there's a coronavirus pandemic.
[00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:52.048]  (laughs)
[00:11:52.218 --> 00:11:56.820]  What you're really participating in is a beta test for AI systems and facial recognition.
[00:11:58.101 --> 00:12:01.402]  See, these cameras work best when people are, you know, distance apart.
[00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:08.707]  Now they're actually testing through machine learning how to recognize, you know, a face that's partially covered.
[00:12:09.487 --> 00:12:12.349]  It's also a way to easily determine who's compliant and who's not.
[00:12:12.929 --> 00:12:15.551]  Who does the propaganda work on and who it doesn't.
[00:12:17.352 --> 00:12:20.934]  Now get this, you know, there's some ironies that are here, right?
[00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:28.079]  A society that kills millions of babies a year for convenience has shut itself down to prevent adults from dying.
[00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:36.572]  People that on the one hand slaughtered babies in the womb, by the millions are now preaching to the masses about the sanctity of human life.
[00:12:37.372 --> 00:12:39.134]  It's double-speak, double-talk.
[00:12:40.034 --> 00:12:42.035]  It's the two-doctrine policy.
[00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.757]  One for the initiated, one for the uninitiated.
[00:12:45.237 --> 00:12:47.419]  One for the inner circle, another for the masses.
[00:12:48.976 --> 00:12:56.341]  It's like saying, if I violate the stay-at-home order, I can be arrested, but you're letting convicted criminals out of prison so they don't get coronavirus.
[00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:57.862]  Thesis.
[00:12:58.582 --> 00:12:59.403]  Anti-thesis.
[00:12:59.843 --> 00:13:00.484]  Synthesis.
[00:13:02.785 --> 00:13:15.033]  If there's a real pandemic, does it require faulty virus models, rigged test results, 81% false positives, inaccurate news reporting, staged hospital overruns, manipulated death certificates?
[00:13:16.074 --> 00:13:16.214]  Nope.
[00:13:19.182 --> 00:13:24.544]  When the government shuts down millions of small businesses, but doesn't lay off any government employees.
[00:13:25.364 --> 00:13:26.304]  It's not about the health.
[00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:34.006]  When the state bans dentists from practicing, but deems it necessary for abortion clinics to stay open.
[00:13:34.626 --> 00:13:35.667]  It's not about your health.
[00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:42.628]  When the state prevents you from buying seeds for your garden, but allows you to purchase lottery tickets.
[00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:44.549]  It's not about your health.
[00:13:45.743 --> 00:13:54.308]  An institution that has the ability to destroy all of Earth through alleged nuclear warfare should not regulate personal self-defense.
[00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:59.972]  An institution that's caught trafficking drugs shouldn't be able to regulate plants.
[00:14:02.273 --> 00:14:10.598]  An institution that's racked up $23 trillion prior to coronavirus in debt shouldn't be allowed to manage the retirement fund.
[00:14:13.723 --> 00:14:19.249]  An institution that was caught spreading STDs should not be allowed to run healthcare.
[00:14:21.454 --> 00:14:42.167]  If people are really concerned about public health and safety in general, but they don't care if people eat garbage, drink poison, smoke cancer, and take prescription drugs, but think that toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and masks are going to protect them from the boogeyman coronavirus, this is a special kind of stupid that I can't address here.
[00:14:43.247 --> 00:14:45.749]  You should ask yourself a couple basic questions.
[00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:52.681]  When did you consent from, you know, you creating a government to serve you to you serving the government ruling over you?
[00:14:54.183 --> 00:14:59.783]   If you want to know who's in charge, just think about who you can and can't criticize.
[00:14:59.783 --> 00:15:16.583]  [MUSIC]
[00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.571]  Tomorrow's news.
