[00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.496]  The information we're about to lay out can save a lot of lives.
[00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:08.126]  But mainstream media and the big pharma cartels are suppressing it.
[00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:11.174]  So the only way it gets out there is if you share it.
[00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:16.457]  Now, Dr. Richard Bartlett has been an emergency room medical doctor for 28 years.
[00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:24.603]  He formerly served as the head of then at the time, Texas Governor Rick Perry's statewide task force over healthcare.
[00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:26.804]  He's very, very respected.
[00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:32.388]  And he's come out with his own experience running an emergency room with COVID patients coming in.
[00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:36.243]  of what has knocked out 100% of the cases.
[00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:38.803]  It's important to note he's not the only one saying this.
[00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:42.322]   The last six months while we've been researching COVID-19 and what's been happening,
[00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:45.923]   it's been all over foreign medical journals, especially in Europe,
[00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:52.332]   that if they used anti-inflammatory steroids, but other classes of anti-inflammatories also have had
[00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:53.363]  incredible success.
[00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:56.562]  Why then is this information suppressed?
[00:00:56.796 --> 00:01:01.977]  And why is the COVID National Task Force, headed up by Fauci and others, not recommending it?
[00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:05.697]  Even though buried in the literature, they've confirmed it works almost 100% of the time.
[00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:17.040]  It's because Dr. Bill Gates, who isn't a doctor, and the NIH are all heavily invested in, including Fauci, in the COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.561]  Including the new, very dangerous, experimental vaccines that have already been hurting and maiming people in the trials.
[00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:27.622]  Again, this has been in the medical literature for six months at least.
[00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:29.623]  And a whole bunch of other drugs have been successful as well.
[00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:31.164]  Why aren't you hearing about them?
[00:01:31.544 --> 00:01:33.045]  Because they're out of patent.
[00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:36.606]  They cost $50 to $200, $300 at the most.
[00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.727]  And within a few days, the people are cured.
[00:01:39.087 --> 00:01:43.869]  Because just like with a bee sting, if you're allergic to it, your lungs swell up with an autoimmune response.
[00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:49.783]  It's not the poison from the bee sting that kills you, it's your body's autoimmune response that kills you.
[00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:54.664]  It's not the peanut that really kills you, it's your body's response to the peanut.
[00:01:55.504 --> 00:01:57.544]  This is simple allergies.
[00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:09.287]  The 50 million that died during the Spanish Flu that started in 1918 are on record as dying, not from the virus, but from the autoimmune response.
[00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:10.527]  And that's what's so evil about this.
[00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:21.176]  Medical professionals across the world have stepped forward and caught the UN and the WHO's recommendations red-handed, causing most the COVID deaths.
[00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:28.400]  Because people need an anti-inflammatory, they don't need high pressure put into their lungs by intubation.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.945]  But still, in many blue states and blue cities, they are ordering hospitals to do it, and that's still where you see the majority of the death.
[00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:38.966]  This is cold blooded murder.
[00:02:39.587 --> 00:02:44.089]  Most people, it turns out, even have an autoimmune response to COVID, get over it by themselves.
[00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:50.672]  But they don't know when they go to the emergency room, that if they are unaware of these other treatments, they might end up dead.
[00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:56.214]  And it's a very, very painful death being on one of these innovation tubes without air going into your lungs.
[00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:59.896]  We have to stop this whole evil agenda now.
[00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:04.216]   And it's going to be real medical doctors and nurses and experts in the field that have
[00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:07.296]  the answers that are going to turn the tide against this.
[00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:10.415]  We were told by Fauci that 2.2 million at least would die.
[00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:12.216]  It's 130,000.
[00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:16.016]   Most of those are old people they killed by sending COVID patients into those hospitals
[00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:17.016]  again.
[00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:19.295]  This is a diabolical plan.
[00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:22.336]  Fauci and the NIH know exactly what they're doing.
[00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:25.816]   But it's going to be grassroots doctors like this man that are going to turn the tide.
[00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:29.935]   And it's going to be you taking action and spreading the word as well.
[00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:34.176]  We're now going under lockdown too in Texas.
[00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:40.418]   and Abbott needs to listen to doctors like Dr. Bartlett now before our economy is irrevocably ruined.
[00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:49.738]   So I mentioned at the start of the show we have a guest joining us.
[00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:51.213]  This is kind of a funny thing.
[00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:52.314]  I'll just tell you a true story.
[00:03:52.334 --> 00:03:54.216]  So last night there was a political event.
[00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:57.459]  I moderated a panel that was speaking at a political event.
[00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:04.325]  And afterward I met someone who attended the event, is a doctor here in Texas, not in Dallas, but in Midland, Texas.
[00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:11.430]  And he has been working also dealing with COVID-19 patients, coronavirus patients.
[00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:15.213]  The article is up again on our website, AmericanKidneyTalk.org.
[00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:20.456]  An article about him is called, Local Doctor Believes He Has Found Silver Bullet for COVID-19.
[00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:24.179]  We had a great conversation after the meeting last night.
[00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:27.201]  And on the spot, I said, why don't you come into my show tomorrow?
[00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:29.062]  And gratefully, he was available.
[00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:34.346]  So here you have, we have joining us in studio, our new friend, Dr. Richard Bartlett.
[00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:34.686]  Hello, sir.
[00:04:35.106 --> 00:04:36.206]  Debbie, I'm honored to be here.
[00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:36.607]  Thank you.
[00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:40.588]  I'm grateful you could be here, and I would love to just have you dive right in.
[00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:44.790]  Since I don't really know you, I'll have you start with telling our listeners about your medical background.
[00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.551]  Well, I've been practicing in Texas for 28 years.
[00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:55.613]  When Governor Perry started a new task force called the Health Disparities Task Force, he asked me to be on that task force.
[00:04:56.354 --> 00:05:02.196]  And the purpose was to give him advice so that all Texans can have access to quality health care.
[00:05:03.076 --> 00:05:04.557]  And that was a two-year appointment.
[00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:07.178]  After two years, he asked me, would you stay on one more year?
[00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.540]  And so that happened year after year for a total of seven years.
[00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:12.621]  And a lot of good things happened.
[00:05:13.362 --> 00:05:20.085]  But I also have been the medical expert for CBS affiliate in West Texas for over 20 years.
[00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:26.529]  And I do a regular weekly update on COVID on the Talk 50, 5.50 a.m.
[00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:28.290]  talk radio in West Texas.
[00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.631]  And we've been doing that since the beginning of this drama.
[00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:31.472]  Wow!
[00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:32.012]  Okay.
[00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:35.856]  And so I'm also an author and do medical missions in other countries.
[00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:38.839]  And so I've seen a lot of disaster all over the world.
[00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:43.884]  But I want to say, echo everything you said in your first five minutes.
[00:05:44.484 --> 00:05:46.566]  I agree 100%.
[00:05:46.827 --> 00:05:48.508]  We already have an answer for this.
[00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:52.932]  And to put things in perspective, let's look around the world.
[00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:57.656]  You know, in the country of Taiwan, there's over 25 million people.
[00:05:57.696 --> 00:05:59.317]  They're stacked on top of each other.
[00:05:59.998 --> 00:06:03.260]  If they did social distancing, they'd be out in the ocean floating around.
[00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:05.962]  There's not enough room for them to do social distancing.
[00:06:06.343 --> 00:06:10.166]  But guess how many people have died to date during the whole pandemic in Taiwan?
[00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:11.266]  Seven.
[00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:16.588]  As many people as you can stack in a minivan going down Central Expressway.
[00:06:16.988 --> 00:06:23.870]  And so the next time your viewers see a minivan, think, oh, that's how many people have died in a country of 24 million people.
[00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.271]  That is astonishing.
[00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:28.332]  Yes, and I'm going to tell you why that's the situation.
[00:06:28.872 --> 00:06:33.314]  It's the situation also in Japan, 121 million people in Japan.
[00:06:33.714 --> 00:06:36.755]  They've had less than a thousand people die during the whole pandemic.
[00:06:37.635 --> 00:06:38.236]  Singapore.
[00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:41.679]  Only 12 people have died in the whole country during the whole pandemic.
[00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.399]  Iceland.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.304]  Well, that's not possible according to what we're being told in the mainstream media, but that's reality.
[00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:49.265]  Anyone can look it up.
[00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:53.429]  You can even look at the Johns Hopkins COVID website and you'll see those numbers.
[00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:54.790]  They're hidden in there.
[00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.814]  But I'm pointing them out because the people in Texas need to hear good news.
[00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:01.516]  In Dallas, they need to hear good news.
[00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:02.837]  And I have good news.
[00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:05.297]  I'm sure you do.
[00:07:05.317 --> 00:07:07.279]  I'm blown away by those numbers.
[00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:08.880]  I gave up trying to write them down.
[00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:14.145]  But you're going to tell us somehow, eventually, when we get to this point, that in these other countries, there's a low death rate.
[00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:14.905]  They're doing what I'm doing, Debbie.
[00:07:15.206 --> 00:07:15.526]  Okay.
[00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:19.890]  They're doing what I'm doing, which is not hydroxychloroquine, although that works.
[00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:24.113]  And so what they're doing is an inhaled steroid.
[00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:27.937]  And so my silver bullet is inhaled budesonide.
[00:07:28.697 --> 00:07:30.539]  The brand name originally was Pomacort.
[00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:31.379]  Now it's generic.
[00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:32.500]  It's super cheap.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.422]  It's about $200 for the total treatment if you pay cash.
[00:07:36.102 --> 00:07:39.024]  With insurance, many of my patients are not even having to pay for it.
[00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.006]  And you use a nebulizer machine.
[00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:42.747]  It's an asthma medicine.
[00:07:43.247 --> 00:07:49.972]  It's a respiratory anti-inflammatory for COVID, which is a respiratory inflammatory disease.
[00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:51.412]  And it works.
[00:07:51.792 --> 00:07:53.693]  A hundred percent of my patients are alive.
[00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:55.453]  I've been treating this since March.
[00:07:56.093 --> 00:07:58.954]  And you use it for five minutes.
[00:07:59.134 --> 00:08:00.915]  It takes five minutes to do a breathing treatment.
[00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:03.035]  You plug it in the machine in the wall.
[00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:07.916]  You put the medicine that's pre-mixed, pre-measured from the pharmacy into the little reservoir.
[00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:10.937]  You push the on button and you breathe it during five minutes during the commercial.
[00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:11.877]  You just have a mask and a face and breathe it?
[00:08:11.897 --> 00:08:13.158]  You don't even have to have a mask.
[00:08:13.198 --> 00:08:14.518]  You can use a little mouthpiece.
[00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:15.078]  Okay.
[00:08:14.918 --> 00:08:20.038]   that you hold in front of you and you breathe it for five minutes.
[00:08:20.038 --> 00:08:24.578]   And I have, let me tell you what I've heard from patients when I started using this.
[00:08:24.578 --> 00:08:28.016]  They tell me, "I feel better during the first treatment."
[00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:29.877]  And so their chest pain goes away.
[00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:31.898]  Their shortness of breath goes away.
[00:08:31.898 --> 00:08:32.898]  Their fever breaks.
[00:08:32.898 --> 00:08:34.616]  I'll give you an example.
[00:08:34.616 --> 00:08:38.738]  I have a patient who has two kinds of cancer.
[00:08:38.738 --> 00:08:44.337]   She calls me after five days of being flat on her back in her house in the bed, can't
[00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:47.337]  get out of bed, fever won't break for five days.
[00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:50.984]  She says, I heard you on the radio and would you please help me?
[00:08:51.024 --> 00:08:51.784]  It's on a Friday.
[00:08:51.824 --> 00:08:56.568]  She says, my granddaughter tested positive today and I think I have it.
[00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:59.090]  And I said, I'm sure you do with all the symptoms you're describing.
[00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:03.134]  She is currently fighting two forms of lymphoma.
[00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:05.256]  She's on chemotherapy right now.
[00:09:06.036 --> 00:09:08.657]  She just had radiation a month before for the lymphoma.
[00:09:09.337 --> 00:09:14.019]  She should die, according to what you hear from the CDC and World Health Organization.
[00:09:14.819 --> 00:09:16.780]  But I gave her that treatment that night.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.341]  In the morning, her fever had broke.
[00:09:18.381 --> 00:09:19.901]  She had her first good night's sleep.
[00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:21.862]  Over the weekend, she recovers.
[00:09:22.222 --> 00:09:24.123]  On Monday, she works an eight-hour day.
[00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:28.604]  She still is fighting cancer, two forms of cancer, but she's cured of COVID.
[00:09:28.644 --> 00:09:30.465]  She's symptom-free.
[00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:32.666]  She has her two consecutive negative tests.
[00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:33.306]  That's a cure.
[00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:35.743]  Okay, can you say the name of the drug again?
[00:09:36.183 --> 00:09:37.004]  Budesonide.
[00:09:37.145 --> 00:09:39.528]  Budesonide, and so is it done in an inhaler?
[00:09:39.588 --> 00:09:45.595]  It's an inhaler, and so it does actually come as an inhaler, but I'm using it in a nebulizer machine.
[00:09:45.795 --> 00:09:48.438]  You know, you see preschool kids use this.
[00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:51.542]  It's safe, it's so safe, it's been out for over 20 years.
[00:09:52.483 --> 00:10:01.305]  It's been used on two-pound premature babies safely, without batting an eye, and the fragile elderly in nursing homes for over 20 years.
[00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:03.385]  There's no reservations with it.
[00:10:03.745 --> 00:10:14.568]  It doesn't cause any cardiac risk, like the accusation of hydroxychloroquine is a risk of heart trouble, although that's ridiculous to make that accusation.
[00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:16.708]  This one doesn't even have that risk.
[00:10:17.288 --> 00:10:22.010]  And so I give that and an antibiotic to protect from secondary bacterial pneumonia.
[00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.711]  But let's talk about what COVID is.
[00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:31.794]  It's a respiratory virus that goes into the lungs, binds to ACE receptors in the lungs, and that triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals.
[00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:34.176]  And we call it a cytokine storm.
[00:10:34.596 --> 00:10:39.578]  That's a fancy word for inflammatory chemicals and enzymes that are released at the total body.
[00:10:40.118 --> 00:10:43.700]  And so with COVID, we have a killer that's never been around before.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.881]  It is killing some people if they're not treated.
[00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:52.104]  And so for 50% of the people, they get it and they don't even know they had it.
[00:10:52.384 --> 00:10:53.524]  50% of the people don't even know.
[00:10:54.345 --> 00:10:57.807]  But for the 20% that are at risk, there are treatments.
[00:10:57.847 --> 00:10:58.847]  We already have an answer.
[00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:00.668]  Let me tell you, you're right.
[00:11:00.728 --> 00:11:04.410]  Taiwan, 24 million people, they don't need to wait for a vaccine.
[00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.232]  They don't have a problem that you should vaccinate 24 million people for.
[00:11:08.272 --> 00:11:10.133]  They only had seven die during the whole pandemic.
[00:11:10.733 --> 00:11:14.675]  We have some treatment plans and options that are already valid and working.
[00:11:15.737 --> 00:11:18.059]  Okay, this is truly, it is great news.
[00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:19.980]  As you said before you went on, great, great news.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.082]  So you've been using this since early March.
[00:11:23.203 --> 00:11:26.065]  Roughly speaking, how many patients do you think you've treated?
[00:11:27.346 --> 00:11:28.667]  I'm getting calls every day.
[00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:31.169]  I have five new patients today.
[00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:33.731]  And so, I haven't even tallied the numbers.
[00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.033]  But every one of them is living, not dying.
[00:11:36.053 --> 00:11:37.153]  I'll give you another example.
[00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:41.236]  A lady who, an elderly lady who has a 50-year history of smoking.
[00:11:42.038 --> 00:11:46.538]   and she had her chest cracked and had a four-vessel bypass surgery.
[00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:49.739]   She's on medicine for high blood pressure and thyroid disease.
[00:11:49.739 --> 00:11:53.938]   She calls me after five days of fever and shortness of breath and chest pain.
[00:11:53.938 --> 00:11:56.438]  She feels like she can barely get across the room.
[00:11:56.438 --> 00:11:58.437]  I start her on the treatment.
[00:11:58.437 --> 00:12:04.338]   With the first treatment, she tells me again something I've never heard with this medicine until COVID-19.
[00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:06.547]  She says, I feel better during the first treatment.
[00:12:07.448 --> 00:12:10.732]  And she's cured with two double negatives after the fact.
[00:12:10.872 --> 00:12:11.673]  She's so grateful.
[00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:17.099]  But with this medicine that's been out for over 20 years, there's lots of research on it.
[00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:17.719]  It's safe.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.221]  Big Pharma's not going to make a dime off it.
[00:12:20.342 --> 00:12:21.602]  Nobody's going to make any money.
[00:12:22.103 --> 00:12:35.292]  It's $200 for the total treatment versus the experimental antiviral that you have to be put in the hospital and then be a part of an experiment to get that costs over $3,100 just for the medicine.
[00:12:36.934 --> 00:12:45.159]  And then you pay $15,000 at least to be in the hospital during that time, unless you go to the ICU, and then you'll get a $30,000 or $40,000 bill on top of being sick.
[00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:50.460]  So this is a medication you prescribed before COVID ever came along?
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:51.640]  Yes.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.341]  For asthma?
[00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:53.662]  For asthma prevention.
[00:12:54.002 --> 00:12:58.344]  You know, there's 25 million people in America that have asthma.
[00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:04.208]  And so this medicine is used routinely for over 20 years to prevent asthma attacks.
[00:13:04.628 --> 00:13:09.651]  It's the first line preventive measure to protect people from having an asthma attack is an inhaled steroid.
[00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:11.932]  And so that's what they're doing in Japan.
[00:13:12.252 --> 00:13:13.792]  That's what they're doing in Taiwan.
[00:13:14.072 --> 00:13:15.533]  That's what they're doing in Singapore.
[00:13:15.553 --> 00:13:17.113]  So even healthy people over there?
[00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:17.653]  Yes!
[00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:24.035]  With COVID, they're treating with inhaled steroids if they get COVID.
[00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:29.056]  So, you know, for the 50% of the people who are going to get it and never have symptoms, they don't need medicine.
[00:13:29.456 --> 00:13:30.817]  They certainly don't need a vaccine.
[00:13:31.497 --> 00:13:36.739]  But for the 20% that are at risk of death if they don't get treated, we have an answer.
[00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:38.379]  And here's what we need to do.
[00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:41.500]  Early treatment, early testing, early treatment.
[00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:42.701]  We need to detect it early.
[00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:48.343]  For every disease, Debbie, America has the best health care system.
[00:13:48.923 --> 00:13:55.565]  And we do early detection and early treatment for cancer, for heart disease, for stroke, for all kinds of infections.
[00:13:56.005 --> 00:14:02.387]  But this is crazy that we're doing what communist China is doing, and we're parroting that through the World Health Organization.
[00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:06.708]  And then the World Health Organization is praising what China did.
[00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:09.669]  And so Italy follows suit.
[00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:24.473]   And look what Italy, over 30,000 people died in Italy so far, versus seven In a country that people are stacked on top of each other, 24 million, and so I'm telling you they came upon the same solution that I came upon independently.
[00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:28.314]  I started treating this in March, and it works!
[00:14:28.754 --> 00:14:39.659]   Okay, I want to, one of the things, so I know you've used it before, which is great, so when you realize that COVID-19 was having such a disastrous thing in America, Did you read someone else who advised you to try this?
[00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:39.859]  No.
[00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:41.521]  You realized this might work.
[00:14:42.142 --> 00:14:48.468]  In March, I was working a 48-hour shift in the emergency room, and I was distraught.
[00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:50.450]  Quite honestly, I was distraught.
[00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.214]  I'm a Christian, and so I was praying throughout that 48-hour shift.
[00:14:54.254 --> 00:14:59.417]   I'd see patient after patient, and I was thinking, God, what am I going to do if someone comes in here with COVID and they're dying?
[00:14:59.437 --> 00:15:01.677]  They're going to trust me to do the right thing for them.
[00:15:02.017 --> 00:15:03.037]  And I don't have an answer.
[00:15:03.398 --> 00:15:07.758]  President Trump mentioned hydroxychloroquine, and then that got shot down immediately.
[00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:09.039]  And so I was praying.
[00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:11.219]  I laid down for a cat nap between patients.
[00:15:11.599 --> 00:15:14.380]  I woke up convinced that God had given me a winning strategy.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.000]  And you know what?
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.021]  A week later, I had to try it out on my first two patients.
[00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:20.521]  And for every patient, it's working.
[00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:23.542]  It's what Japan has stumbled on.
[00:15:24.122 --> 00:15:27.504]  And what Taiwan has stumbled on, an inhaled steroid.
[00:15:27.524 --> 00:15:29.045]  They're using a different one than I'm using.
[00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.866]  The one I'm using, I think, is better.
[00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:33.768]  Inhaled budesonide with a nebulizer treatment.
[00:15:33.868 --> 00:15:39.811]  I'm also giving an antibiotic that will cover walking pneumonia and other pneumonias called clarithromycin.
[00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:43.753]  And I also give zinc because that interferes with virus multiplication.
[00:15:44.094 --> 00:15:46.255]  But the silver bullet is inhaled steroids.
[00:15:46.875 --> 00:16:03.059]  And the reason I use inhaled instead of IV is because if you give it a steroid IV or as a shot in the muscle that goes total body through the bloodstream or as pills that goes total body, you're turning every time, you're turning down the immune system, the ability to fight infection.
[00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:06.340]  Every time, you're dialing down the ability to heal.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.061]  But if you use it as a targeted source, it's like one of my sons is a firefighter.
[00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:20.948]   If you target They shoot the fire extinguisher at the source of the fire, at the base of the fire, and all the flames go out.
[00:16:21.369 --> 00:16:31.717]  This is like targeting the source of the inflammatory chemicals at the source, and all the fiery flames of inflammation are put out at the source with a nebulizer treatment.
[00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:37.642]  The reason I'm using a nebulizer is if you use an inhaler, 90% of the medicine never gets to where you need it.
[00:16:37.842 --> 00:16:38.703]  Research shows that.
[00:16:39.484 --> 00:16:40.525]  But a nebulizer works.
[00:16:40.979 --> 00:16:42.040]  Okay, so I'm thrilled.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.901]  This is fabulous, fabulous news.
[00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:50.605]  So what is the reason, first of all, you're aware of this, I know, that there's great pushing in this country.
[00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:53.807]  It seems to just hold off, stay home, wait for the vaccine.
[00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:59.390]  When you discover something like this, what do you do as a doctor when you've discovered any time a new treatment?
[00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.051]  How do you let other doctors know?
[00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:02.212]  How do you let the government know?
[00:17:02.472 --> 00:17:03.933]  Debbie, I'm doing everything I can.
[00:17:03.953 --> 00:17:11.919]  That's why I stayed here an extra day, so I could be on the news with you, so we can let the good people of Dallas know that we have solutions to this problem already.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.123]  And last Friday I got a call from Ted Cruz's office.
[00:17:17.883 --> 00:17:18.664]  He's heard about it.
[00:17:18.924 --> 00:17:24.508]  So he reached out to me, and so his chief of staff and another member called me, and we had a 30-minute call.
[00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:27.050]  I've written a paper about this.
[00:17:27.731 --> 00:17:37.659]  We cite 51 articles that are tried and true from established journals, well-recognized journals, supporting what we're doing.
[00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:42.742]  And so we have sent that unpublished paper to Senator Cruz's office already.
[00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:47.146]  So he's responsible for the information he has now, and now everybody knows he has it.
[00:17:47.486 --> 00:17:47.967]  Yes, they do.
[00:17:48.007 --> 00:17:54.114]  But also, I expect next week, I understand that President Trump will also have my unpublished paper.
[00:17:54.454 --> 00:17:58.058]  We're of course going to publish it, but why wait six months until it gets published?
[00:17:58.498 --> 00:17:59.920]  Let me tell you something else, Debbie.
[00:18:00.821 --> 00:18:05.606]  This inhaled budesonide against COVID is currently being studied by the NIH now.
[00:18:05.867 --> 00:18:06.647]  Their study will be...
[00:18:07.248 --> 00:18:09.089]  Their study will be out in October.
[00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:14.111]  They somehow, I don't know if they heard what I was doing, but their study will be over in October.
[00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.212]  But it's set up for failure at the start.
[00:18:17.232 --> 00:18:18.172]  And let me tell you how.
[00:18:19.413 --> 00:18:21.934]  Early detection and early treatment.
[00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:23.454]  That's common sense.
[00:18:23.574 --> 00:18:25.855]  That's the American health care system.
[00:18:26.635 --> 00:18:30.077]  What we're getting is what Communist China has forced on the whole world.
[00:18:30.617 --> 00:18:33.018]  Don't wait until you're a breath away from death.
[00:18:33.098 --> 00:18:36.299]  Wait until the house is burned two-thirds down and then seek help.
[00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:37.840]  This is what NIH is doing, you're saying?
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:45.784]  This is what the CDC is telling us to do, and every authority is telling us, don't seek help if you've got mild to moderate symptoms.
[00:18:45.844 --> 00:18:47.445]  Wait until you have severe symptoms.
[00:18:47.805 --> 00:18:54.989]  I'm getting calls from people who go to the ER because they feel bad, and they're sent home with a positive test saying, take Tylenol and tough it out at home.
[00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:58.390]  That is the standard of care that's being put out.
[00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:04.092]  That's a terrible plan for any health care problem, especially one that can kill you.
[00:19:04.492 --> 00:19:06.972]  And for 20% of the people, this is a killer.
[00:19:07.593 --> 00:19:12.194]  And we don't know who that 20% is, but if they have symptoms, we have something we can do about it.
[00:19:12.514 --> 00:19:14.035]  So the NIH is studying it.
[00:19:14.075 --> 00:19:15.015]  Let me tell you who else is.
[00:19:15.295 --> 00:19:17.576]  The country of France, which has lost over 30,000 people to this.
[00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:24.517]  And Spain has said that they're going to study inhaled budesonide against COVID-19.
[00:19:24.737 --> 00:19:26.638]  They haven't set their start date yet.
[00:19:26.938 --> 00:19:32.939]  And last week, the University of Oxford announced that they're going to study inhaled budesonide against COVID.
[00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:48.403]  Whether they set the study up for failure, like I feel like the NIH has done, where they're going to wait until someone... The criteria by the NIH is you have to have pneumonia and be in the ICU and be on a ventilator before they'll even give you this.
[00:19:49.143 --> 00:19:49.764]  I want to jump in.
[00:19:49.804 --> 00:20:01.092]  So this treatment you're describing, NIH is somewhere aware that you've been using it and have had success with patients and that you're ascribing the same success in these other countries you've mentioned.
[00:20:01.593 --> 00:20:04.275]  So why would the NIH recognize what you're claiming?
[00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:10.199]  Why would they test it by waiting until someone who is severely ill in the hospital?
[00:20:10.239 --> 00:20:14.643]  What is the reason not to test it in the way that you have been, which is early on for symptoms?
[00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:18.302]  Why are we doing anything that we're doing right now, Debbie?
[00:20:19.424 --> 00:20:27.715]  I'm just saying, what they did in Italy was social distancing, wear a mask, shut down everything.
[00:20:28.316 --> 00:20:29.077]  How did that work?
[00:20:29.638 --> 00:20:30.880]  Let's talk about what works.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:38.663]  Which is what I'm doing, which is what they're doing in Japan and Singapore and Taiwan, and that's early detection.
[00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:40.623]  It's good that we're doing mass testing now.
[00:20:40.663 --> 00:20:44.965]  I'm telling you, at the ER that I am associated with, they're doing testing now.
[00:20:45.005 --> 00:20:47.026]  They didn't have the ability to do the testing in March.
[00:20:47.366 --> 00:20:52.228]  We were scrambling to find where we could even send people to get tested in March.
[00:20:52.628 --> 00:20:58.210]  The reason the numbers are going up is that we're having a hundred times the amount of tests being done right now.
[00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.210]  And that's a good thing.
[00:20:59.290 --> 00:20:59.951]  It's a good thing.
[00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:02.692]  That's what they're doing in those countries, the early detection.
[00:21:03.132 --> 00:21:04.873]  Hey, we do that with, we don't wait.
[00:21:05.213 --> 00:21:15.799]  I've actually done biopsies on people who had abnormal mammograms, and during the biopsy, I've removed the whole cancer, and the person was cured with early detection.
[00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:20.361]  We don't say, wait until you've got stage four cancer, and then seek help.
[00:21:20.421 --> 00:21:22.022]  We don't do that with any other disease.
[00:21:22.722 --> 00:21:25.945]  I don't know why this is being forced on us, but it's un-American.
[00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:29.427]  It's cruel to people.
[00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:30.488]  People are dying.
[00:21:30.708 --> 00:21:31.509]  That's pretty cool.
[00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:39.815]  And beyond that, it's crazy right now that if you get COVID, you get put in the hospital, your family can't be there to be your advocate.
[00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:45.580]  I can't tell you how many times I've, as a doctor, have had loved ones in the hospital and they hang something.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.641]  My daughter was pregnant.
[00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:47.682]  They hang something.
[00:21:47.722 --> 00:21:48.562]  I say, what are you giving her?
[00:21:48.602 --> 00:21:50.003]  It's half in her already.
[00:21:50.424 --> 00:21:51.865]  And they tell me, and I said, that's not for her.
[00:21:52.265 --> 00:21:53.485]  And it's for the room next door.
[00:21:54.026 --> 00:21:56.546]  You don't have an advocate in the room with you.
[00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:57.867]  Well, I'm telling you the truth.
[00:21:57.887 --> 00:22:02.548]  A family member in the room is an advocate that you are not allowed to have right now.
[00:22:03.208 --> 00:22:11.171]  And if you'll look at what's going on right now, if we wanted to go with science, a scientific fact by definition is observable and reproducible.
[00:22:11.471 --> 00:22:11.591]  Yeah.
[00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:18.055]  And so when I started hearing people say, I feel better with inhaled budesonide, that was something that I'd never heard before.
[00:22:18.115 --> 00:22:20.156]  I observed it and it's reproducible.
[00:22:20.616 --> 00:22:30.922]  But the decisions that are made that are being forced on us, for 20 years we'd see there's an epidemic in China and we'd see them walking, b-rolling with people walking the streets with masks.
[00:22:32.003 --> 00:22:33.404]  It wasn't working for them then.
[00:22:33.424 --> 00:22:36.448]  I don't know why it's being forced on the whole world now.
[00:22:36.568 --> 00:22:46.840]  That kind of thinking, something that's working in Japan and Singapore and is working with my patients, we should be focused on science and facts instead of fear.
[00:22:48.476 --> 00:22:53.779]  There's some sort of manipulation toward encouraging America to just wait it out for a vaccine.
[00:22:53.879 --> 00:23:03.004]  I don't know if it's the pharmaceutical companies, if it's individuals in power invested in the pharmaceutical companies, but who would be telling Americans, we'd rather you die because we want you to wait for a vaccine?
[00:23:03.064 --> 00:23:06.166]  It seems like people are willing to sacrifice others for an agenda.
[00:23:06.186 --> 00:23:11.249]  It seems that way to me because we have some solutions already that are working.
[00:23:11.529 --> 00:23:14.411]  There's a track record of success by many doctors in Texas.
[00:23:15.612 --> 00:23:20.519]  And Texas is standing out compared to other states, if you look, as far as the survival rate.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:29.834]  But I think there is a lot of political motivation behind the decisions that are being made right now.
[00:23:30.942 --> 00:23:37.567]  Okay, well, I do too, and I'm deeply troubled by them because I do, well, you don't have to agree with my assessment, but I'll tell you where my concern is.
[00:23:37.948 --> 00:23:42.752]  I think that in the first five today, talk about the headlines and that, you know, panic porn.
[00:23:43.192 --> 00:23:53.801]  I think there's a great agenda on the part of some in this country and many in the media that want to keep the economy damaged because of the results of the coronavirus, want to keep Americans afraid in their homes.
[00:23:54.301 --> 00:23:56.723]  All of that works against the reelection of President Trump.
[00:23:56.903 --> 00:23:59.384]  Be afraid, be very afraid, because there's a pandemic.
[00:23:59.564 --> 00:24:02.325]  Oh, by the way, Debbie, we had a pandemic in 2009.
[00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:03.886]  It was the H1N1.
[00:24:04.286 --> 00:24:07.987]  And you know what?
[00:24:08.027 --> 00:24:10.928]  The flu strain that's going around right now is H1N1.
[00:24:11.488 --> 00:24:13.089]  Our patients that have the flu are having H1N1.
[00:24:13.769 --> 00:24:15.070]  We're not focused on that at all.
[00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.691]  It's not as big a deal as they thought it was.
[00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:17.692]  But you know what?
[00:24:17.752 --> 00:24:24.717]  I just saw an article that Anthony Fauci is warning us that we might have a new pandemic coming of H1N1 from China.
[00:24:24.777 --> 00:24:25.397]  It's already here!
[00:24:25.778 --> 00:24:27.239]  That's the strain that's already here.
[00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:33.784]  A lot of things that are being spoken, there's a lot of misinformation, a lot of things that are being blown out of proportion.
[00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:35.725]  And we have good news today.
[00:24:35.825 --> 00:24:37.346]  I'm here to tell you the good news.
[00:24:37.526 --> 00:24:38.507]  I know, it's really news.
[00:24:38.547 --> 00:24:41.069]  Yes, look at those countries, look at my results.
[00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.052]  I believe Dr. Lozano is doing the right thing as well.
[00:24:45.433 --> 00:24:51.798]  And yet, it's just like we met this wall of opposition from the media and frankly the pharmacy companies are holding out hope for a vaccine.
[00:24:51.818 --> 00:24:56.862]  Well, you know, they say that there was a concern about a shortage of hydroxychloroquine.
[00:24:57.122 --> 00:25:02.824]  Let me tell you, Budesonide inhaled steroid that's super cheap and readily available, pre-mixed, pre-measured.
[00:25:03.164 --> 00:25:04.564]  Nobody's going to make any money off of it.
[00:25:04.644 --> 00:25:05.665]  It's at every pharmacy.
[00:25:05.725 --> 00:25:06.985]  There is an abundance of it.
[00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:08.206]  There will never be a shortage.
[00:25:08.686 --> 00:25:11.507]  And so that accusation will not be valid.
[00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:13.447]  Can't trip you up that way.
[00:25:13.727 --> 00:25:13.847]  No.
[00:25:15.048 --> 00:25:18.389]  But they could do a study and set it up for failure and announce it in October.
[00:25:19.338 --> 00:25:20.500]  That is truly astonishing.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.945]  It would be set up in a way that they're going to use it after people are already so sick that obviously it reduces.
[00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:26.106]  Not good medicine.
[00:25:26.406 --> 00:25:27.207]  No, not good medicine.
[00:25:27.648 --> 00:25:36.698]  So what is your sense about, if you do what you're describing, early testing and all that, what is your sense about the importance of masks, the everyday use of masks?
[00:25:36.718 --> 00:25:41.381]  You know, I'm going to pivot off of that because that's what they did in Italy in over 30,000 deaths.
[00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:43.883]  That's what they did in France, over 30,000 deaths.
[00:25:44.223 --> 00:25:46.204]  That's what they did in Spain, 30,000 deaths.
[00:25:46.284 --> 00:25:49.446]  And in New York, a pair did that, 30,000 deaths.
[00:25:49.767 --> 00:25:56.131]  Let's go with a winning strategy of early detection and early treatment with a winning strategy of a successful treatment.
[00:25:56.611 --> 00:25:57.492]  And that's what we have.
[00:25:57.992 --> 00:26:02.235]  We have an effective treatment that's cost effective, readily available at every pharmacy.
[00:26:02.775 --> 00:26:04.817]  And so there are several ways to treat this.
[00:26:04.837 --> 00:26:06.158]  There's several ways to treat the flu.
[00:26:07.058 --> 00:26:27.648]  You know, if I told you the reason we're going to shut down the country, hairdressers will not be able to have their salons open, we're going to shut down everybody's business, non-essential business, and we're going to start doing this craziness, because tens of thousands are dying from a respiratory viral illness that's very contagious.
[00:26:28.388 --> 00:26:29.389]  Oh, that's the flu.
[00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:34.252]  Over 80,000 a year die from the flu, but we've never worn masks to protect people before.
[00:26:34.312 --> 00:26:37.394]  We've never insisted on that to save American lives.
[00:26:37.694 --> 00:26:39.035]  We have something that works.
[00:26:39.736 --> 00:26:52.724]  You know, if you look on the internet, you'll see in Japan, they're still crawling all over each other at sushi bars, acting normal, and they have less than 1,000 that have died, over 121 million people.
[00:26:53.565 --> 00:26:56.947]  This social distancing thing is not what is saving them.
[00:26:57.654 --> 00:27:19.661]  That was my next question on social distancing, because there have been many people challenging masks and social distancing, really from a political perspective, a feeling there's just too much control coming out of the government based on a health problem and, you know, and with penalties, actual penalties for business owners and personal, people's lives, and the whole surrender of our economy, the people losing businesses.
[00:27:20.501 --> 00:27:30.052]  And you just, I mean, it seems like those things should have been decided, doctors giving advice and people getting to decide themselves, but there's been a mandatory feel about this that's alarming people.
[00:27:30.352 --> 00:27:37.980]  Yeah, when you have the government saying, I know more about what's good for your health than your doctor who knows you and your family, that's socialism.
[00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.242]  That's communism.
[00:27:39.462 --> 00:27:39.582]  Yes.
[00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:42.644]  And that's what we've seen not be a good idea in China.
[00:27:42.784 --> 00:27:46.225]  We were all in horror watching the apocalypse happen in China.
[00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:47.926]  People were dropping in the streets.
[00:27:48.106 --> 00:27:48.987]  Everybody saw that.
[00:27:49.487 --> 00:27:55.750]  And then we saw the wave spread across Italy, to France, to Spain, and then to our country.
[00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:05.875]  And you know, the strategy they were using is the same strategy they're still recommending, and now fining people possibly for not wearing a mask and social distancing.
[00:28:06.015 --> 00:28:19.138]  That strategy didn't work in any of those places, but we have some winning strategies that are working in other parts of the world and that I'm also, that's now being studied and about to be studied by the University of Oxford and the country of Spain.
[00:28:19.598 --> 00:28:21.139]  We should go with the winning strategies.
[00:28:21.639 --> 00:28:23.059]  I'm in favor of the winning strategy.
[00:28:23.139 --> 00:28:25.920]  I also wish, well I'm glad that you were able to come today and talk about all this.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.041]  I really wish for more of a, I don't know, national broadcasting system.
[00:28:31.061 --> 00:28:39.529]   It seems like doctors around the country, if you had more and more doctors doing what you're doing, You would end up where people just would be less alarmed.
[00:28:39.569 --> 00:28:40.689]  Fewer people would be worried.
[00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:42.370]  More doctors would be doing what you're doing.
[00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:49.713]  The numbers would have to dissipate in terms of death rates and hospitalization rates and that just seems like the most obvious thing.
[00:28:49.773 --> 00:28:54.255]   So I know you said you went to your You're hoping to have President Trump see this.
[00:28:54.735 --> 00:28:55.736]  Taking a Ted Cruz.
[00:28:55.816 --> 00:28:56.896]  I love that he knows about it.
[00:28:56.916 --> 00:28:57.056]  U.S.
[00:28:57.116 --> 00:28:58.217]  Representative Babin.
[00:28:58.457 --> 00:29:00.537]  My phone's been blowing up with a few phone calls.
[00:29:00.618 --> 00:29:01.218]  I have U.S.
[00:29:01.258 --> 00:29:04.799]  Representative Babin who's been calling and texting me regularly from Texas.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.720]  And I got a call the other day.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.701]  I went to Texas Tech.
[00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:20.547]  And at Texas Tech, I went to the undergraduate, got my degree in medical technology in the first class of medical technology there, where we grow viruses and bacteria and we study that and we do the testing.
[00:29:20.947 --> 00:29:22.308]  And then I went to medical school there.
[00:29:22.808 --> 00:29:24.909]  And then I did my surgery residency there.
[00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.490]  So I'm a Texas Tech-er.
[00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:31.093]  So my phone blows up and a guy calls me and he says, this is Kent Hance.
[00:29:32.148 --> 00:29:34.329]  Wow, he was the Chancellor of Texas Tech!
[00:29:34.529 --> 00:29:37.270]  And I'm stuttering and fumbling to talk to him.
[00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.391]  I can't believe he's... Can I call you Richard?
[00:29:39.951 --> 00:29:40.511]  Yes, sir!
[00:29:41.152 --> 00:29:43.232]  And so he knows about this treatment.
[00:29:43.733 --> 00:29:47.374]  So I'm letting you know who knows about this, and we'll see what happens with it.
[00:29:47.414 --> 00:29:49.095]  But Kent Hance knows.
[00:29:49.195 --> 00:29:50.535]  Representative Babin knows.
[00:29:50.895 --> 00:29:52.716]  Ted Cruz has a paper.
[00:29:53.136 --> 00:29:54.857]  I believe it'll get to President Trump.
[00:29:55.297 --> 00:30:00.463]  I know there's a Star Parker who is with the White House, and she has my information.
[00:30:00.804 --> 00:30:02.786]  So we'll see who does something with this.
[00:30:03.847 --> 00:30:04.248]  Okay.
[00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:08.293]  Star Parker of CURE, of the Center for Urban... No.
[00:30:08.644 --> 00:30:14.349]  Star Parker with the government has a connection with the administration.
[00:30:14.369 --> 00:30:15.730]  She was on my show on Tuesday.
[00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.291]  That's kind of funny.
[00:30:17.692 --> 00:30:17.912]  Yes.
[00:30:18.252 --> 00:30:18.492]  Okay.
[00:30:18.793 --> 00:30:19.553]  So let me ask you this.
[00:30:19.653 --> 00:30:24.517]  So if we are describing, were to be nationally adopted, so we had testing.
[00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:26.219]  Our country would be wide open again.
[00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:29.000]  Well, the other question is, would there be a need for a vaccine then?
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:29.420]  No.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:36.703]  And is there a need for a vaccine right now with the same pandemic in Taiwan and Japan and Singapore and Iceland?
[00:30:36.883 --> 00:30:39.004]  Iceland's only had 10 died during this whole pandemic.
[00:30:39.605 --> 00:30:43.246]  That's a big, you know, OK, seven in Taiwan.
[00:30:43.626 --> 00:30:47.068]  That's a minivan going down Central Expressway.
[00:30:47.468 --> 00:30:53.991]  When you see a minivan, everybody that's died in a country of over 24 million, they don't need... And a densely packed country.
[00:30:54.051 --> 00:30:54.391]  Right.
[00:30:55.452 --> 00:30:57.574]  Let's talk about the vaccine for a second, Debbie.
[00:30:57.694 --> 00:30:59.235]  This is information people need to know.
[00:30:59.656 --> 00:31:01.497]  This is a rapidly mutating virus.
[00:31:01.557 --> 00:31:06.922]  In Iceland, they broke it down, the DNA of the virus, and they found 243 mutations already.
[00:31:07.263 --> 00:31:08.223]  And that was in April.
[00:31:08.724 --> 00:31:09.384]  That's all right.
[00:31:09.525 --> 00:31:10.445]  We have an answer for it.
[00:31:10.465 --> 00:31:11.606]  There's several ways to treat this.
[00:31:11.647 --> 00:31:13.228]  I'm not scared of COVID anymore.
[00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:15.210]  Nobody else should be scared of COVID.
[00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.131]  I would not either.
[00:31:16.231 --> 00:31:16.671]  Go ahead.
[00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:18.973]  You should not be scared of COVID anymore.
[00:31:19.133 --> 00:31:20.835]  I'm telling you, don't be scared of COVID.
[00:31:21.715 --> 00:31:23.236]  There are some ways to treat it.
[00:31:23.596 --> 00:31:26.337]  If your doctor won't treat you, find another doctor.
[00:31:26.838 --> 00:31:30.779]  But we're in America, and there is a solution.
[00:31:30.879 --> 00:31:32.200]  There are several solutions for this.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.801]  I'm talking about one of them.
[00:31:34.501 --> 00:31:35.962]  Rapidly mutating virus.
[00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:39.123]  A vaccine is not going to be the solution.
[00:31:39.363 --> 00:31:41.104]  This is a coronavirus.
[00:31:41.965 --> 00:31:43.945]  It goes around every year, the common cold.
[00:31:44.286 --> 00:31:47.427]  We get flu vaccines every year, and at best, it covers 40%.
[00:31:48.748 --> 00:31:52.009]  And so that's not a 100% success rate, and you have to get it every year.
[00:31:52.429 --> 00:31:56.051]  If they're going to make this vaccine, it's not going to be a one-time shot.
[00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:57.512]  That was my last question.
[00:31:57.752 --> 00:32:12.620]  And, by the way, the people like Anthony Fauci and Birx who brag that they've been working on a vaccine for AIDS for 40 years and they have not been successful because it's a rapidly mutating virus parallel to what we have now.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:19.203]  So misinformation is out there being sent to doctors right now that we're not worried about a vaccine being made because this isn't changing much.
[00:32:19.523 --> 00:32:23.644]   The fact is that they're not going to get unless they do some research.
[00:32:23.644 --> 00:32:28.043]  243 mutations in a study in Iceland already.
[00:32:28.043 --> 00:32:33.003]   And so you're not going to be able to get a handle on this and make a safe, effective vaccine.
[00:32:33.003 --> 00:32:35.003]  Let's talk about vaccines in general, Debbie.
[00:32:35.003 --> 00:32:43.722]   When they had the race for the polio vaccine, Polio, an American story, is a book that's out in 2005.
[00:32:43.869 --> 00:32:51.254]  The author was our keynote speaker for the Texas Medical Association, and he explained that thousands died from the vaccine.
[00:32:52.034 --> 00:32:56.017]  And tens of thousands were paralyzed or debilitated from the vaccine.
[00:32:56.598 --> 00:33:03.624]  We don't want to speed at warp speed towards a vaccine and force it on the American people when we don't, first of all, don't need it.
[00:33:03.824 --> 00:33:08.628]  And we, secondly, we need to make sure we don't miss any of the steps that prove that it's safe.
[00:33:09.062 --> 00:33:10.022]  Yeah, the side effects.
[00:33:10.043 --> 00:33:11.943]  So I want to make clear one particular point.
[00:33:12.604 --> 00:33:15.265]  243 mutations of this means that... In Iceland.
[00:33:15.405 --> 00:33:15.965]  Yeah, in Iceland.
[00:33:16.005 --> 00:33:17.286]  It's changing, it's changing.
[00:33:17.426 --> 00:33:19.487]  Trying to get a handle on it and make a vaccine.
[00:33:19.627 --> 00:33:31.553]  Say the vaccine being looked at right now, they're trying to develop now, even if they made it and it was perfectly effective as to the current COVID-19 problem, would not necessarily be effective for all of the rest of the mutations.
[00:33:31.693 --> 00:33:32.413]  Is that correct?
[00:33:32.554 --> 00:33:32.814]  Yes.
[00:33:33.054 --> 00:33:42.736]   And the beautiful thing about the treatment that I'm using No matter how many times it mutates, it's universally going to work because it decreases the inflammation.
[00:33:42.776 --> 00:33:47.677]  It's a respiratory anti-inflammatory solution for a respiratory inflammatory problem.
[00:33:48.298 --> 00:33:50.358]  And I've had people go through many adventures.
[00:33:50.498 --> 00:33:52.318]  Each person's COVID story is different.
[00:33:52.838 --> 00:33:54.199]  But thank you, Jesus.
[00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:55.679]  All of them have lived.
[00:33:55.839 --> 00:33:56.759]  None of them have died.
[00:33:57.359 --> 00:33:59.640]  And I am ecstatic.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:05.041]  I would think that any American person would be excited about it.
[00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.889]  Yeah.
[00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:14.176]  Dr. Richard Bartlett, this is a fabulous, first of all, I'm so glad we connected, interesting, kind of at a political meeting, but I'm so glad we connected, so glad you can come in.
[00:34:14.716 --> 00:34:16.237]  I love all the information you shared.
[00:34:16.257 --> 00:34:19.380]  Is there a place they can read right now more about what you're doing?
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.701]  Is there something they can go to, or do they have to wait for your paper?
[00:34:22.222 --> 00:34:27.546]  Have them contact you, and I'll send you a copy of my own published paper with all the references.
[00:34:27.826 --> 00:34:28.407]  That sounds great.
[00:34:28.547 --> 00:34:31.909]  And you will have what President Trump will have in his hand next week.
[00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:35.032]  You will have what Senator Cruz has in his hand.
[00:34:35.932 --> 00:34:38.353]  Whether he reads it or not, and what he does with it, is up to him.
[00:34:38.893 --> 00:34:41.554]  But you're going to have what he has, and it's working.
[00:34:42.054 --> 00:34:45.755]  And if you want to get that, email me at americachemmychalk at gmail.com.
[00:34:46.235 --> 00:34:47.775]  americachemmychalk at gmail.com.
[00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:51.276]  I will happily forward the paper once I receive it from Dr. Richard Bartlett.
[00:34:51.517 --> 00:34:52.777]  Sir, thank you so much for coming in.
[00:34:52.797 --> 00:34:53.617]  This is fabulous.
[00:34:53.637 --> 00:34:54.217]  Thank you so much.
[00:34:54.297 --> 00:34:54.878]  Thank you, Debbie.
[00:34:54.918 --> 00:34:56.318]  It's a good day to be in Texas.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:58.360]  It is a good day to be in Texas.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.404]  We need to get back to the land, back to self-sufficiency, and back to being prepared.
[00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:12.192]  And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen, is having friends and family with a bug-out plan if there is a total collapse and water filtration and food to last you at least a few months.
[00:35:12.833 --> 00:35:15.114]  And the food we have is very high quality.
[00:35:15.354 --> 00:35:17.714]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile.
[00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:20.395]  They have wide selections, special diets, you name it.
[00:35:20.635 --> 00:35:22.215]  It's the best price you're going to find.
[00:35:22.336 --> 00:35:25.936]  But you need to get the orders in now, in the lull before the storm.
[00:35:26.237 --> 00:35:27.877]  I told you lockdown 2 was coming.
[00:35:28.057 --> 00:35:29.777]  The New World Order is making its move.
[00:35:29.958 --> 00:35:36.839]   Whether Trump loses or wins, Things are just going to get more crazy, and this food lasts 25 years inside the containers.
[00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:48.722]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury, something you know is an ace in the hole for you and your family in the future, and the little bit of profit that comes in funds the InfoWar to continue to warn the people.
[00:35:49.142 --> 00:35:55.363]  So you're also funding InfoWars, the most powerful Paul Revere organization in the world, and it's powered by you.
