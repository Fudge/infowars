[00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:56.786]  Whatever you do, spread the word about the broadcast and know the enemy of America is hoping you don't take action.
[00:12:57.566 --> 00:13:05.308]  The main rallying point for modern Paul Revere is InfoWars.com, Band.Video, and NewsWars.com as well.
[00:13:05.728 --> 00:13:08.809]  So again, I know you're taking action, and I salute you.
