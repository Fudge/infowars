[00:00:02.065 --> 00:00:12.110]  Roger Stone's hanging judge, Judge Jackson, has come out and said any American speaking out against her ruling is basically a terrorist and a criminal.
[00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.289]   Well, as an American, I must stand up for the birthright of all free humans and say
[00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.810]   that we the people will exercise our first amendment no matter what she says.
[00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:34.690]  Piss up a rope, Judge Jackson.
[00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:44.690]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.211]  You monster!
[00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:42.653]  The thing about North Korea is, it's powers only inside North Korea.
[00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:46.095]  Same thing with you, lady.
[00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:51.298]  Your illegitimate, out-of-control power grab only goes as far as we put up with.
[00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:56.241]  You are a sniveling witch who will burn in hell!
[00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.440]  You're another arrogant, vicious, aggressive judicial tyrant!
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.461]  And you are the bane of free nations!
[00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:09.261]  You are a curse on free peoples!
[00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.222]  You are not an American!
[00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:15.743]  You are an authoritarian dirtbag witch!
[00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:22.164]  Now try that on for size, you pig-faced monster!
[00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:27.105]  Judge Amy Berman Jackson, appointed by Obama.
[00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:34.939]  Has been the judge put in position by the deep state to railroad anybody that's pro-Trump into federal prison.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:46.046]  And I've come out publicly and pointed out months ago that they had members of the jury that she'd picked who worked for Obama as the heads of major agencies.
[00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:54.171]  And one lady's husband was the chief lawyer on the Robert Mueller investigation.
[00:01:56.707 --> 00:01:57.968]  It just gets crazier from there.
[00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:14.841]  So now today in court, on Tuesday, she came out, it's all over the news, and attacked Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, and Alex Jones, and said that we're intimidating the jury.
[00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:22.887]  So she is now looking at giving Roger a longer prison sentence.
[00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:23.728]  Now just wait a minute.
[00:02:25.683 --> 00:02:34.045]  The jury, months ago, found Roger Stone guilty, not of Russian collusion, but of supposedly lying to Congress about talking to Julian Assange, which he never even said.
[00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.765]  So she's, I've got the transcripts, I was just reading them.
[00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:45.827]  She's all over the news saying, well, they intimidated the jury, and they threatened the jury, which we never did.
[00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:47.227]  That's not even true either.
[00:02:47.887 --> 00:02:52.208]  And so, I'm gonna throw the book at Roger Stone, because we gotta protect the jury.
[00:02:53.444 --> 00:03:02.833]  And she says, I'm going to extend the gag order, which no one's ever done, post-conviction, post-sentencing, on Roger Stone.
[00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:09.499]  Now, I'm no lawyer, and most of you aren't either, but everybody knows, like, you're convicted, you're sentenced, you got free speech.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.982]  And everybody knows we never threaten any juries.
[00:03:13.683 --> 00:03:20.775]   It came out that one of the jurors Was a department head under Obama and her husband worked for Robert Mueller.
[00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:22.856]  So of course we said, that's crazy.
[00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.777]  And top lawyers said, Jones is right.
[00:03:25.357 --> 00:03:28.158]  You have a right to expose jurors that have a conflict of interest.
[00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:29.939]  So that juror had to step down.
[00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.941]  Jackson's pissed because we're calling her on her BS.
[00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:38.262]  The woman is a tyrant.
[00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:41.681]  She thinks she's Kim Jong-un in North Korea.
[00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:51.921]   Roger Stone has been convicted by her kangaroo court and her selected jury of Democrats.
[00:03:51.921 --> 00:04:01.921]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:53.147 --> 00:04:08.572]  If I come out and expose all that, they don't need to have a gag order continue on to protect a jury that already did the job as hand-selected Democrats in a political witch hunt to convict Roger Stone.
[00:04:09.452 --> 00:04:11.592]  I mean, this is a war on common sense.
[00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:13.173]  It's like CNN's headline.
[00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:16.694]  Man gives birth to baby.
[00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:18.815]  No they didn't!
[00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:19.895]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:22.716]  It doesn't equal 10 if CNN says so.
[00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:26.937]  So, Jackson's trying to set me up.
[00:04:26.977 --> 00:04:32.018]  She's trying to get me to do something so she can divert from the fact that Russiagate came up empty.
[00:04:32.698 --> 00:04:36.039]  That Trump was found not guilty by the Senate in the fake impeachment.
[00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.199]  They have nothing.
[00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.720]  And Roger Stone was supposed to be the cherry on top after Trump was convicted and thrown out of office.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.681]  Oh look, Roger Stone, he's a Russian agent.
[00:04:44.363 --> 00:04:52.949]  But his conviction isn't for Russian collusion, it's for lying to Congress about talking to Julian Assange when he always said, I'm talking to WikiLeaks, not Julian Assange.
[00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.191]  As if talking to Assange is illegal anyways.
[00:04:58.232 --> 00:05:01.054]  So, it's desperate times for the deep state.
[00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:05.217]  But I want to let Judge Jackson know this.
[00:05:07.298 --> 00:05:10.200]  Andrew Jackson is turning over in his grave that you have the last name Jackson.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.783]  You are the epitome of Kim Jong-un, of Adolf Hitler, of Mao Zedong, of V.I.
[00:05:15.803 --> 00:05:17.264]  Lenin, of Stalin.
[00:05:17.344 --> 00:05:18.645]  I mean, of Pol Pot.
[00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:23.188]  Phil Castro was humanitarian compared to you.
[00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:25.170]  Hugo Chavez is an angel compared to you.
[00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:33.436]  And then you sit there in court, I read the transcript, and attack me that I'm talking about you and say that's a reason to put Roger in jail longer.
[00:05:34.256 --> 00:05:36.238]  You live in America, witch!
[00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:49.615]  We have free speech to talk about what a monster you are, what a dirty, conniving, political appointee you are to execute injustice against America.
[00:05:50.775 --> 00:05:54.597]  You think the whole world is your North Korea to gang-rape freedom?
[00:05:56.637 --> 00:05:58.818]  I'll be honest, Roger never told me what to say on there.
[00:05:59.738 --> 00:06:04.280]  Roger went out and made a public statement months ago about, I trust in God, I trust in Trump, I trust the people.
[00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:09.097]  I talked to Roger, he said, all I can say is I trust in God, I trust in Trump, I trust in the people.
[00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:13.040]  I went on air and I said, Roger says I trust in God, I trust in Trump, I trust in the people.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.604]  And I went on to say, if Roger wants you to stand up for him, he's going to be convicted by this kangaroo jury the day before!
[00:06:19.724 --> 00:06:20.444]  And it came true!
[00:06:20.744 --> 00:06:21.365]  That was me!
[00:06:22.526 --> 00:06:24.407]  But we have speech, monster!
[00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.167]  It doesn't extend out in the whole galaxy.
[00:06:29.108 --> 00:06:33.911]  So, go ahead and play your hand, but I wish no harm upon Judge Jackson.
[00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:35.012]  I've never done that.
[00:06:35.032 --> 00:06:36.193]  She's trying to act like this big victim.
[00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:40.376]  She's the political operative that puts people in prison for their political views.
[00:06:41.337 --> 00:06:42.498]  The whole world sees you, witch.
[00:06:43.418 --> 00:06:45.200]  You're the big joke at the end of this whole thing.
[00:06:46.144 --> 00:06:50.327]  Roger Stone was supposed to be the consolation prize where you put somebody in prison and prove Russiagate.
[00:06:50.587 --> 00:06:55.691]  Instead, it makes it clear that you will be known like the Nazi show trials.
[00:06:56.852 --> 00:06:58.654]  Carried out by the Nazis as a joke.
[00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:00.115]  You did that!
[00:07:02.336 --> 00:07:04.738]  Judge Jackson, you did this to yourself.
[00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:06.720]  You destroyed yourself.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.982]  But the left never takes credit for what you've done to yourselves.
[00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:14.646]  I'm actually sad that we have judges in America as dirty and corrupt as you, in my view.
[00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:18.086]  I'm actually sad that you're this big a piece of trash.
[00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:28.611]  But I can tell you, again, for myself and all my ancestors that fought to create this country, all my family that fought and died in covert operations, you can kiss my ass and I'll never shut up.
[00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.151]  I'll never bow to you.
[00:07:31.252 --> 00:07:35.193]  And I'll never sit there and let you lie about good Americans and destroy the First Amendment.
[00:07:36.094 --> 00:07:45.278]  You have now come out and attacked the First Amendment in a frontal assault and tried to claim that people saying you're a tyrant is a threat to jurors who already made their decision.
[00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:48.390]  The world sees through you, Jackson.
[00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.292]  You can't assault people and not have them speak up against you.
[00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:57.593]  And just like Hitler, you're going to learn that lesson.
[00:07:58.053 --> 00:07:58.554]  You understand?
[00:08:00.074 --> 00:08:02.775]  Because you're on the wrong side of history, Jackson.
[00:08:03.915 --> 00:08:07.915]  and ideologies like yours are gonna burn in hell.
[00:08:07.915 --> 00:08:19.915]   Americans need to stop bowing down to people that are dishonorable.
[00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:20.415]  Go!
[00:08:20.415 --> 00:08:30.415]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:44.210]  The left has whipped themselves up into a piranha-like frenzy to run around and assault and attack and shoot people and drive cars into us and sue everybody and bear false witness and say all these honorable judges, like Kavanaugh, are rapists with no proof.
[00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:46.149]  It's disgusting!
[00:08:47.611 --> 00:08:51.555]  And people are sick and tired of it.
[00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:54.839]  And they see through your crap.
[00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:59.485]  And this isn't the type of awakening where it just kind of we wake up for a while and it goes away.
[00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:00.546]  It's going to get more intense.
[00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:02.108]  It's going to get deeper.
[00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:04.611]  It's going to absolutely explode.
[00:09:05.783 --> 00:09:07.965]  And it's going to be a rocky road, folks.
[00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:12.749]  But I'm here to tell you, humanity's up to the challenge with God's help of all the things we face.
[00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:18.194]  And this is the beginning of the end of these technocrats and the things they're involved in.
[00:09:18.614 --> 00:09:21.777]  But no one is buying this miscarriage of justice.
[00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:30.224]  And I predict that within two weeks, Roger Stum will be back co-hosting this broadcast and the War Room.
[00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:37.377]  Before World War II started, the Japanese Empire had invaded China and taken it over.
[00:09:37.998 --> 00:09:45.740]  After that, the globalists that were running America took control of China and have set it up as an engine of global domination and communism.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.441]  Hitler couldn't even dream to carry out the tyrannies the Chi-Coms have.
[00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:55.462]  And now, China has launched a crisis with the Wuhan virus worldwide.
[00:09:57.162 --> 00:10:04.855]   They took a coronavirus And they DNA genetically engineered it into a biological weapon known as SARS.
[00:10:05.335 --> 00:10:14.058]  And then they supercharged it with DNA genetic engineering to add into SARS HIV and the flu virus.
[00:10:14.598 --> 00:10:17.859]  And then they gave it these gain-of-function activities.
[00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:25.182]  So we're dealing here with some type of biological weapon that we have never encountered before.
[00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:32.144]  I know I harp on this a lot, and it's because at 46 years old, I finally figured it out in the last five years.
[00:10:33.124 --> 00:10:37.006]  When I was a child, I learned that my intuition, my gut, was never wrong.
[00:10:37.826 --> 00:10:44.348]  Now sometimes my gut was telling me something and I kind of projected off and picked something else that was a threat, but the threat was always real.
[00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:47.849]  Sometimes I would just get distracted onto a threat that wasn't the main issue.
[00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:57.668]   So sitting here in the year 2020, and all the incredible things that are happening, I'm just pulling back and reminding listeners that we're all in this together.
[00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:00.390]  I personally am storing food.
[00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:02.552]  I personally have firearms.
[00:11:03.093 --> 00:11:05.034]  I personally am training and know how to use them.
[00:11:05.675 --> 00:11:08.918]  I personally believe in being self-sufficient and independent.
[00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:18.086]  And of course then, I sell you things that I think and know you need that will make you more independent and more powerful in our fight together.
[00:11:18.766 --> 00:11:20.408]  I see myself connected to you.
[00:11:21.068 --> 00:11:29.691]  My common sense tells me what to do, and then I project that out and promote that, and others resonate with it, and I resonate with what you're saying, and we come together.
[00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:43.035]  So I feel really good promoting high-quality, storable foods and supplements and things that make your immune system better, make you healthy, make you live longer, like X2, X3 iodine, or the ultimate turmeric formula bodies, or high-quality, storable foods.
[00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:47.437]  But I just want to remind listeners that Communist China is imploding right now.
[00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:50.819]  And they've covered up how deadly this virus is.
[00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:52.720]  Are they using it as a political crackdown?
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.360]  I don't know.
[00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:56.962]  The fact is we don't want to end up like their people.
[00:11:57.002 --> 00:11:58.043]  They're living hand to mouth.
[00:11:58.523 --> 00:12:00.064]  We want to be empowered now.
[00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:05.964]   We want to be informed and we want to be able to sit on top of the guns and the ammo and
[00:12:05.964 --> 00:12:11.084]   the will to use them to defend ourselves and the food and the communications to move forward
[00:12:11.084 --> 00:12:12.084]  in the future.
[00:12:12.084 --> 00:12:16.363]   Because being independent and being empowered is absolutely king.
[00:12:16.363 --> 00:12:21.964]   So again, don't end up like communist China and Italy that is now locked down in the north
[00:12:21.964 --> 00:12:23.644]  with martial law.
[00:12:23.644 --> 00:12:25.924]  Be prepared now.
[00:12:25.924 --> 00:12:27.523]  Go out, get a firearms training lesson.
[00:12:27.803 --> 00:12:28.964]  Go out, buy some affordable food.
[00:12:29.545 --> 00:12:30.425]  Don't even get it from us.
[00:12:30.465 --> 00:12:37.550]  The point is the mindset of thinking about bigger things and not just thinking about yourself and going to work or what you're doing.
[00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:45.456]  Thinking about the bigger world and your role in being informed, your role in being involved, that opens up your spirit, opens up all the pathways.
[00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:49.619]  It opens up everything your ancestors did and that's the larger world.
[00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:56.828]  So that's why metaphysically buying storable food or supplements to take care of your body isn't just what you're physically doing, though that pays off.
[00:12:57.288 --> 00:13:02.115]  It's about what you're metaphysically doing, making the decision in your mind and your soul to do that.
[00:13:02.898 --> 00:13:03.818]  So we're covering it all.
[00:13:03.898 --> 00:13:05.699]  We hope this thing planes out and is great.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.120]  But it looks like it's a big globalist move.
[00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:14.423]  And that's why I want to encourage listeners to go to mfulworthstore.com while we still have affordable food ready to ship and get it today.
[00:13:14.704 --> 00:13:23.127]  And get the other supplements because we need the patriots that are awake and informed to be as healthy and focused and ready to be leaders in the future with what's coming down.
[00:13:23.588 --> 00:13:24.348]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:25.549]  I want to thank you all.
[00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:27.610]  Whatever you do, spread the word about the live broadcast.
[00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.431]  mfulworthstore.com forward slash show and band.video.
