[00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:05.911]  So it's Tuesday night, and I'm here at the office looking at the news coming in.
[00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:10.213]  ABC, CBS, NBC, Associated Press, you name it.
[00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:14.034]  And I've gotten too close to the problem.
[00:00:14.074 --> 00:00:17.195]  I've gotten where I'm comfortable with all this, where it's not a big deal to me.
[00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:28.739]  I'm reading where they have checkpoints on the highways, randomly grabbing people and taking them to COVID centers, quarantine centers in New York City.
[00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:34.813]  I'm reading where Xi Jinping is announcing a global ID to fly on planes anywhere in the world.
[00:00:34.873 --> 00:00:36.094]  The airlines are agreeing.
[00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:47.219]  And I'm looking at articles and TV newscasts out of New Mexico where the governor shuts down grocery stores saying getting food is not essential.
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.601]  This is all part of martial law.
[00:00:51.857 --> 00:01:00.963]  So the Democrats and the socialists and the communists, the globalists under you in command have already had Australia locked down for eight months where people can't even leave their houses.
[00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:05.046]  If there's one case in a city of COVID, they're locked down again for months.
[00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:09.769]  Even though COVID isn't as bad as the flu, this is martial law.
[00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:10.950]  This is slave training.
[00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.631]  And by breaking down the economy, it triggers a financial collapse.
[00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:22.673]  But don't worry, the big central banks that create money out of nothing are there to loan you money and interest when you're bankrupt.
[00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:25.394]  I mean, this is classic slavery.
[00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:31.556]  And then Klaus Schwab of the Demos Group, the globalist mouthpiece, says, we're building a post-human world.
[00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:33.356]  We want to bankrupt the third world.
[00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:36.577]  We want to starve people to death, but it's liberal.
[00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:38.642]  It's insane.
[00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:51.977]  So how this works is they've turned up the different COVID tests 20 times, 30 times, 45 times in the UK, where if you've had a viral infection in a decade or bacterial infection, you are positive.
[00:01:52.457 --> 00:01:56.001]  So they go, Oh my God, the cases are skyrocketing, but deaths aren't.
[00:01:56.752 --> 00:02:02.595]  But if they get enough cases, they can say anybody that dies of a car wreck, gunshot wounds, cancer, has COVID.
[00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.236]  So this is a takeover.
[00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:07.558]  They're playing on the fact the public's not informed about science.
[00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.703]  And it is an economic weapon to keep us shut down in Europe, in the US, in Canada, in Australia, while China's been open for six months.
[00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:17.024]  And that's all this is.
[00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:18.305]  It's bigger than a tariff.
[00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.299]  You know, it's bigger than any of that.
[00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:29.921]  It is, we're shut down, they're open, and China is now the engine of the world economy because they're an authoritarian state and the big banks and big tech support that.
[00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:34.162]  I mean, it's coming out that Apple is lobbying the U.S.
[00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:38.082]  Congress not to pass a law that they can't run slave labor in China.
[00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:43.323]  They have three million Muslims in death camps making components for iPhones.
[00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:45.004]  I mean, that's the left.
[00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:46.024]  That's who they are.
[00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.060]  And the average low-level leftist has no power.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.321]  They just believe because they've imprinted on the tyranny like a baby duck.
[00:02:54.101 --> 00:03:02.104]  You know, baby duck hatches out, it'll imprint on a wolf, it'll imprint on an 18-wheeler, it'll imprint on a shotgun, it'll imprint on another duck.
[00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:07.586]  They've imprinted like, we're taking over, we're the winners, we're fighting Nazis.
[00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:18.072]   And they support communist Chinese death camps, they support total surveillance, and now New Mexico Weeks ago had signs like, don't come here, it's all over, we're all dying, end of the world.
[00:03:19.693 --> 00:03:21.855]  And a quarter million people in a year have died from COVID.
[00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:23.476]  Most of those died from something else.
[00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:26.558]  They said it would be 2.5 million six months ago.
[00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.200]  It's all lies.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:47.098]   And then the former heads of major drug companies, their chief financial officers, their chief science officers, their chief virologist, go public from Pfizer and so many others and say, this is all a fraud and then that gets censored.
[00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:51.559]  This is the corporate excuse to bankrupt the world and consolidate power.
[00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.921]  But here it is, New Mexico governor shuts down grocery stores for two weeks.
[00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:56.761]  It's always two weeks.
[00:03:56.781 --> 00:04:03.744]  Remember, they were just going to shut things down for two weeks so the hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed and people went to the hospitals, they were all empty.
[00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:10.266]  And you know, we've dealt with this where we have employees that have family that work at other companies.
[00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:14.815]  And somebody else at the company tests positive for COVID.
[00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:18.096]  90% of the time it's a false positive.
[00:04:18.497 --> 00:04:22.658]  And then everybody else gets sent home from the warehouse or the school.
[00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.839]  And that's the thing.
[00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.820]  Oh, if anybody tests positive at your grocery store, it has to shut down.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.461]  This is the shutdown of our infrastructure.
[00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:33.042]  This is economic war.
[00:04:33.742 --> 00:04:38.564]  And it's up to us that are leaders, the followers aren't going to listen, to realize the mask is a symbol of slavery.
[00:04:39.485 --> 00:04:42.126]  And a symbol of economic enslavement, and we're not going to buy it.
[00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:51.088]  So the Democrats, the UK as well, all the big deep state globalists, Germany, everyone's revolting against their new world order.
[00:04:51.488 --> 00:04:53.929]  So they brought in COVID as the pretext for their lockdown.
[00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:03.512]  And even John Kerry, former Secretary of State, even the current British Prime Minister, members of the EU say, we're doing this to teach populists a lesson.
[00:05:05.558 --> 00:05:07.479]  You're being punished for voting for Trump.
[00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.519]  You're being punished for voting for Brexit.
[00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.900]  And Boris Johnson's one of their total operatives.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.641]  A real turncoat, a real disappointment.
[00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.702]  So, you're not essential.
[00:05:18.062 --> 00:05:19.442]  You having food's not essential.
[00:05:19.702 --> 00:05:21.003]  Your business isn't essential.
[00:05:21.503 --> 00:05:26.385]  But oh, Walmart and Target and Amazon, they're not being shut down.
[00:05:26.805 --> 00:05:28.525]  It's mom and pop grocery stores.
[00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:33.287]  It's all a test to see if you'll shut down your church.
[00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.610]  Your synagogue, your mosque, they're all not essential.
[00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:39.212]  This is BS, folks.
[00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:41.173]  People are not following the orders anymore.
[00:05:41.613 --> 00:05:53.159]  Whether it's in New York, kicking people out of their gyms, the cops, or whether it's LA, people out in the streets, or whether it's the New Jersey governor that's a tyrant being confronted in public, people are awake and they're saying no.
[00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:59.282]  Just like the head of Trump's COVID task force, Dr. Atlas said, it's time to rise up.
[00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:03.844]  This is a power grab under the lockstep.
[00:06:04.722 --> 00:06:15.208]  And under the Great Reset, Klaus Schwab and Justin Trudeau and Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel all admit, oh, COVID's not a threat.
[00:06:15.448 --> 00:06:17.109]  We're doing this to control the populist.
[00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.011]  They admit it's about bringing you to your knees.
[00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.533]  That's how much disdain they have for you and your family.
[00:06:25.495 --> 00:06:27.197]  So I say burn in hell globalist.
[00:06:27.697 --> 00:06:28.558]  You're not essential.
[00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:30.140]  It's time for you to be fired.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.661]  It's time for you to lose your house.
[00:06:31.921 --> 00:06:33.343]  It's time for you to lose your job.
[00:06:33.623 --> 00:06:35.225]  It's time for you to go to prison.
[00:06:35.965 --> 00:06:39.109]  We know who you are and we're not putting up with your crap anymore.
[00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:43.333]  You did all this because we woke up and we said no and now you're panicking.
[00:06:44.374 --> 00:06:46.816]  And now you're out in the open trying to tell us we're not essential.
[00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:48.017]  You're not essential!
[00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:51.533]  You Nazi pieces of crap like Klaus Schwab.
[00:06:52.134 --> 00:06:52.854]  Spread this video.
[00:06:52.894 --> 00:06:56.677]  It's a Band Off video where the resistance lives and where humanity's fighting back.
[00:06:56.977 --> 00:07:01.141]  Tell others to share the video and tell them to share it and them to share it if you want to win.
[00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:02.842]  If not, roll over to die.
[00:07:02.862 --> 00:07:04.061]  The choice is yours.
[00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:10.302]  [MUSIC]
[00:07:10.302 --> 00:07:11.582]  Remember, don't worry.
[00:07:11.609 --> 00:07:12.230]  Be happy.
[00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.431]  Everything's going to be alright.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.921]  Over and over, you know, we're told, let the technocracy spy on you.
[00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.342]  Let big tech control what you do.
[00:07:20.742 --> 00:07:22.483]  They will never abuse their power.
[00:07:22.523 --> 00:07:23.464]  They will never hurt you.
[00:07:24.324 --> 00:07:32.987]  And just as soon as they got their global AI grid in, they used Communist China as the beta test to sell the world on a dystopic martial law lockdown.
[00:07:33.627 --> 00:07:36.649]  When it all started eight, nine months ago, I told you it's never going to end.
[00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.329]  They're never going to turn loose this power.
[00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.831]  They're going to make you have internal passports on your phones.
[00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:44.633]  To leave your house, to have a job, to travel.
[00:07:44.653 --> 00:07:49.417]  They're going to add more and more restrictions on of how you get that travel pass.
[00:07:49.517 --> 00:07:51.378]  Remember The Running Man?
[00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:55.842]  Schwarzenegger movie in the mid-80s written by Stephen King about a future police state?
[00:07:56.383 --> 00:07:58.344]  Watch that movie and then compare it to today.
[00:07:58.905 --> 00:08:07.192]  We are in the absolute brand, the absolute mold of a classic authoritarian dystopic nightmare.
[00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:09.034]  We've got to reject this now before it's cemented.
[00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:11.944]  You know, something very sad is happening.
[00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:18.206]  It's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago when InfoWars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:34.112]  I warn everybody there was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals and populists.
[00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:34.932]  And now that's happened.
[00:08:35.552 --> 00:08:49.119]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown, and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 as basically an overblown hoax.
[00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:56.282]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[00:08:56.663 --> 00:09:04.527]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American people and divide us, and they're going to use economic warfare, shutting down the economy, to try to control us.
[00:09:05.428 --> 00:09:09.645]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling people what's coming next.
