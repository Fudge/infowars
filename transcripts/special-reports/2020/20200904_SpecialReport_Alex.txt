[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:02.191]  Senator, what do you mean something's going on?
[00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:03.212]  You've got a feeling.
[00:00:03.252 --> 00:00:03.992]  Tell us what you think.
[00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:12.659]  My feeling is that there is interstate criminal traffic being paid for across state lines, but you won't know unless you arrest them.
[00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.981]  There are people that are on the streets.
[00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.903]  There are people that are controlling the streets.
[00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:20.726]  We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend.
[00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:25.370]  And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs.
[00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.413]  Wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms with gear and this and that.
[00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:31.634]  They're on a plane.
[00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:37.699]  I promise you that at least some of the members and the people who attacked us were not from D.C.
[00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.320]  They flew here on a plane.
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.143]  They've all got fresh new clothes and they were paid to be here.
[00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:54.389]  There has been a huge development, one of the biggest yet, in understanding who Antifa is, who set them up, who they work for, and what their endgame will ultimately be.
[00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.972]  Now we've known that George Soros, the Democratic Party, have been funding this group for over 20 years.
[00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:06.798]  And we got documents three years ago showing they were trying to trigger martial law in Maryland in 2015, working directly under Obama, with Alexander Soros funding them.
[00:01:07.058 --> 00:01:22.317]   But now, a local investigative journalist In Portland, Oregon, has gone and discovered the secret Antifa base, complete with social distancing, a art display, privacy fence around it, porta potties, and even police protection.
[00:01:22.698 --> 00:01:25.902]  Then, by day, they shoot heroin and get drunk.
[00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:37.567]  And listen to communist speeches online and by night they march out and burn buildings and shoot innocent people in the chest and engage in their criminal activity and they're being protected by the Democratic Party.
[00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:43.589]  We're about to play this report where they actually try to attack him with a slingshot that is a deadly weapon.
[00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.370]  This is by Never Alone.
[00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.131]  Uh, with Christ.
[00:01:47.571 --> 00:02:01.123]  And then we'll also, at the end of this report, show you my documentary film from the year 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, where in Seattle, the government was housing Antifa in a private office building and residential building.
[00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:03.646]  They commandeered from citizens.
[00:02:04.246 --> 00:02:07.329]  So this is the Democrats and this is who's loading them on planes.
[00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:11.573]  And this is who's flying them around the country to DC and Kenosha and you name it.
[00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:14.534]  We've had Antifa attack our vehicle here in Austin.
[00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:17.575]  We had to buy an armored vehicle to even be able to go cover these demonstrations.
[00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.656]  And the blue city mayors order the police to stand down.
[00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:30.120]  And when they arrest these individuals for arson and stabbings and shootings, they are released just like the shooter who just got killed by the feds yesterday when he pulled a gun on him.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.562]  He just killed an innocent man a few days before on the streets of Portland, Oregon.
[00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:35.922]  So that's what this is.
[00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:37.663]  This is the army of the left.
[00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:39.043]  It's disgusting and dangerous.
[00:02:39.423 --> 00:02:42.908]   And Senator Paul, He's saying he wants to know who's behind it.
[00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:44.211]  They know it's being funded.
[00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:46.698]  Trump says powerful, shadowy rich people are funding it.
[00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:47.640]  We know they are!
[00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:54.632]  You private citizens can find this and show you this that you know the Pentagon and the police and the FBI know.
[00:02:55.112 --> 00:03:10.442]  The question is why aren't they moving against a terrorist training camp here in America that has been identified, that believes in the destruction of our very country's existence, and that marches through the streets all over the country shouting, death to America and no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:03:10.843 --> 00:03:12.424]  So this major base has been discovered.
[00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:18.848]  The man trying to document it politely was attacked with a deadly weapon and other journalists have gone there now and more is coming out.
[00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:20.889]  Hello, how are you my friends?
[00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:21.670]  Welcome to my channel.
[00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.730]   is this proves the Democratic Party is behind this organization and using taxpayer money to fund
[00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.360]  a secret CHOP/CHAS Antifa terrorist training organization.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.530]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWar.
[00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.689]   Hola, como esta, amigos? Welcome to my channel. I find myself currently over here
[00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:48.290]  close to Hawthorne Bridge, I believe it to be.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.884]  Right in between Hawthorne Bridge and Burnside Bridge.
[00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:53.930]  The bus just stopped.
[00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:56.734]  I took off and went down that way.
[00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:02.999]  But I've been wondering where this large crowd of agitators has been coming from for the last 90 days.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:18.432]  And I think I discovered where such a large crowd of agitators can house themselves and stage themselves for such a long period of time and still be able to be so close to the center of action every single night.
[00:04:19.372 --> 00:04:21.094]  This is a war encampment.
[00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:33.025]  A number of these individuals have been sent to Kenosha, but this is a legitimate issue right here, I would say.
[00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:36.730]  This is funded by the city.
[00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:41.969]  And what it houses is absolute anarchists.
[00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:53.860]  People that refuse to conform and cause damage every single night and then get to come back and are housed and given money and protected under the same rights and liberties that they spit upon.
[00:04:57.643 --> 00:04:59.485]  They have this privacy fence right here.
[00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:04.290]  They say it's an art installation actually.
[00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:07.806]  And so somebody was paid quite a bit of money.
[00:05:07.826 --> 00:05:10.188]  I will show you the sign here in a bit.
[00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:28.019]   Somebody was paid quite a bit of money to put this privacy fence in and it supposedly connects This housing unit with the sky, the river, and yeah, the Willamette River that's just right over here, and the woodlands.
[00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:35.521]  So the one thing that you gotta notice, see right here, individuals like this, they try to stifle your free speech instantly.
[00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:42.763]  These are the type of people that cry about issues, and then are the ones that are absolutely the cause of said issues.
[00:05:43.363 --> 00:05:46.143]  So what we have here is something that really needs to be addressed.
[00:05:46.343 --> 00:05:47.824]  I'm gonna go take a picture of the sign.
[00:05:49.255 --> 00:05:52.537]  Before I get stabbed or something by some sort of drug addict.
[00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:55.919]  All there is is needles, needles, needles.
[00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:57.340]  It's disgusting.
[00:05:58.861 --> 00:06:01.743]  Right there, violent.
[00:06:01.803 --> 00:06:04.124]  That's the same violence that they show every single night.
[00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:06.145]  You guys do that every night, right?
[00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:07.907]  Ha ha!
[00:06:08.287 --> 00:06:08.967]  I knew it!
[00:06:09.207 --> 00:06:09.568]  Yep!
[00:06:10.428 --> 00:06:12.329]  This is where they house the rioters!
[00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.751]  This is where the rioters are housed!
[00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:19.301]  Hey, look over there.
[00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:20.761]  Look at that look.
[00:06:21.662 --> 00:06:22.922]  That's a look of violence.
[00:06:24.282 --> 00:06:25.042]  Every single night.
[00:06:25.122 --> 00:06:26.202]  Oh, there's Trumpet Man!
[00:06:26.642 --> 00:06:28.023]  There's Trumpet Man right there!
[00:06:28.043 --> 00:06:29.243]  I knew it!
[00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:31.443]  This is where they house every single rioter!
[00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:33.304]  Okay, it's official.
[00:06:33.344 --> 00:06:34.164]  Housed by the city.
[00:06:34.224 --> 00:06:35.284]  No, I'm coming down, brother.
[00:06:35.884 --> 00:06:37.024]  You don't gotta throw nothing at me.
[00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:39.405]  Hey, look at that.
[00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:41.085]  Man's about to shoot me with a slingshot.
[00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:44.005]  He's such a dumbass.
[00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:45.886]  Couldn't even hit a fucking thing right in front of him.
[00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:46.906]  Continue on.
[00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:50.125]  While I videotape this assault...
[00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:52.125]  [car honks]
[00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:54.125]  [inaudible]
[00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:56.125]  No, this is where anarchists live, Simpleton!
[00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.125]  Anarchist lives, simpleton.
[00:06:57.769 --> 00:06:59.690]  There are no rules in life, Simpleton!
[00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.891]  Are you not an anarchist?
[00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:03.531]  There are zero rules!
[00:07:05.152 --> 00:07:08.273]  I am... Do as thou wilt is the only rule!
[00:07:09.354 --> 00:07:10.754]  Do as thou wilt, correct?
[00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:12.975]  They're just so hypocritical!
[00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:21.093]   They've had so much given to them off the blood, sweat, and tears of individuals You see, police, things were meant to get out of hand.
[00:07:21.534 --> 00:07:26.218]  To train the public to live in a continual state of emergency.
[00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:29.460]  Martial law is not some Hollywood pronouncement.
[00:07:30.061 --> 00:07:34.404]  It's an incremental slide towards more and more control.
[00:07:35.065 --> 00:07:42.351]  And on a scale of 1 to 10, on the police state Richter scale, we're at a 4 or a 5 right now in America.
[00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:50.200]  While the labor march was large and peaceful, it was the unexpected violence that captured most of the media attention.
[00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:57.066]  There's three issues of mischaracterization that have been sort of compounded by ignorance that I really think need to be addressed.
[00:07:57.006 --> 00:08:00.006]  Number one, the civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:05.006]  [applause]
[00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:10.006]   The police did nothing but stand there until there was enough property damage
[00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:12.006]  and then suddenly there was a civil emergency.
[00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:16.678]  I would want the City Council to look into the Federal Government's role in these events as well.
[00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:21.142]  These protestors were held at a FEMA installation at Sandpoint.
[00:08:21.382 --> 00:08:24.185]  And I'd like to know what happened to the foreign nationals who were arrested.
[00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:25.967]  And are they in trouble with the INS?
[00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:26.347]  Thank you.
[00:08:28.484 --> 00:08:29.625]  It just makes me furious.
[00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:38.556]  Building owner Wal Louis says he wanted police to arrest the demonstrators who occupied his three-story building at the start of WTO meetings.
[00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:40.759]  He says they left a mess.
[00:08:40.939 --> 00:08:42.681]  We're just cleaning up the mess right now.
[00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:47.667]  There's some human waste up there that we haven't removed and nobody wants to touch it.
[00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:51.570]  We'll try to find an outfit to do that.
[00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:57.634]  Instead of eviction, police asked housing activists to negotiate with demonstrators.
[00:08:57.874 --> 00:09:10.684]  Sharon Lee of the Low Income Housing Institute convinced the protesters to voluntarily leave the building, in part by offering them temporary housing in a private non-profit shelter around the corner.
[00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:15.182]  I think we avoided a major confrontation.
[00:09:15.182 --> 00:09:16.682]  This is a failure of leadership.
[00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:22.583]   We're about to get to hard core evidence proving that the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
[00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:25.982]   that secret government system, was actually running the show.
[00:09:26.444 --> 00:09:32.203]   But first, even more evidence that the city was aiding and abetting the criminal anarchist.
[00:09:32.203 --> 00:09:37.484]  [Screaming]
[00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:41.324]   We've all witnessed the confrontations over the past few days.
[00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:46.196]  At times it's hard to tell whether police are protecting citizens or threatening them.
[00:09:46.216 --> 00:09:52.161]  When two apparent good Samaritans stop to help a fallen woman, they all get pepper sprayed.
[00:09:52.882 --> 00:09:54.783]  Even media members weren't spared.
[00:09:55.524 --> 00:10:01.407]  If you thought the anarchists who commandeered a privately-owned downtown building were out of town now, well, think again.
[00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:07.410]  As Cairo 7 Eyewitness News reporter Christina McKenna has found out, they're still here and still living rent-free.
[00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.572]  Susan, when these anarchists moved out of the building behind me on Saturday, a lot of people thought they should have been headed to jail.
[00:10:13.892 --> 00:10:23.497]  Instead, it turns out, a lot of them just headed around the corner, and they're now living in a building right over here, where they're enjoying electricity, hot water, and heat, all rent-free.
[00:10:25.376 --> 00:10:27.719]  Saturday afternoon was a celebration here.
[00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:34.667]  Seven days after they commandeered this downtown building, anarchists walked away without a word from police.
[00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:35.988]  It feels to me like we won.
[00:10:36.349 --> 00:10:38.111]  And at least some are still winning.
[00:10:38.411 --> 00:10:43.978]  As part of the deal to get them to surrender this building, anarchists were offered housing just around the corner.
[00:10:44.438 --> 00:10:45.499]  At the same price.
[00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:56.687]  The building is owned by the Low Income Housing Institute, a private non-profit that is in large part funded by the city and is now working with the city to house the anarchists.
[00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:58.188]  First of all, the criminal trespass.
[00:10:58.228 --> 00:11:01.571]  If that was me or you or the average person out in the street, we'd be in jail.
[00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:05.253]  John Satoli can't believe the anarchists aren't in jail now.
[00:11:05.553 --> 00:11:14.299]  As a lawful tenant in the building the anarchists had seized, he was locked out of his packaging and shipping business for a week during his busiest season.
[00:11:14.719 --> 00:11:21.904]  Satoli can't believe he's now contemplating bankruptcy and the people who put them there have paid no consequence at all.
[00:11:22.144 --> 00:11:22.744]  They walked away.
[00:11:22.764 --> 00:11:30.049]  They walked away and they, the city of Seattle, low-income housing, moved them across the street on me and yours taxpayers' dollars.
[00:11:30.987 --> 00:11:34.733]  So why didn't the police department arrest the anarchists when they moved out of that building?
[00:11:34.813 --> 00:11:39.941]  Well, that's a question a lot of people are asking, especially since the West Precinct is just down the block.
[00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:41.923]  We asked the police department this weekend.
[00:11:42.084 --> 00:11:43.085]  We asked them again today.
[00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:45.228]  They still haven't returned our call with an answer.
[00:11:50.111 --> 00:11:53.534]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:11:53.554 --> 00:11:54.695]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:56.116]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:11:56.437 --> 00:11:57.818]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[00:11:57.918 --> 00:11:58.939]  I want them shut down.
[00:11:59.019 --> 00:11:59.920]  I want them silenced.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.761]  I want them muted.
[00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.582]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:03.563]  You kept us on air.
[00:12:03.683 --> 00:12:04.984]  We did the analysis first.
[00:12:05.265 --> 00:12:06.245]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:08.307]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:12:08.387 --> 00:12:14.293]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[00:12:14.853 --> 00:12:15.934]  You need to stop right now.
[00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:17.094]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:19.595]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:20.796]  This is not going to happen.
[00:12:20.816 --> 00:12:22.477]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[00:12:22.937 --> 00:12:24.037]  I used to say, support InfoWars.
[00:12:24.497 --> 00:12:25.398]  Rescue InfoWars.
[00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:26.118]  Save yourself.
[00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:27.119]  Save the world.
[00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:28.299]  We're in this together.
[00:12:28.619 --> 00:12:29.380]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.061]  Communism's up here.
[00:12:31.221 --> 00:12:34.183]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:36.584]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:12:36.604 --> 00:12:38.145]  My children are right here!
[00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:40.627]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:12:40.847 --> 00:12:41.907]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:12:42.088 --> 00:12:42.988]  And I need prayer!
[00:12:43.128 --> 00:12:44.089]  And I need action!
[00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:46.070]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[00:12:46.791 --> 00:12:48.732]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
